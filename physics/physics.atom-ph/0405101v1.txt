Abstract

A general method is described for ﬁnding algebraic expressions for matrix elements of any one- and
two-particle operator for an arbitrary number of subshells in an atomic conﬁguration, requiring neither
coeﬃcients of fractional parentage nor unit tensors. It is based on the combination of second quantization
in the coupled tensorial form, angular momentum theory in three spaces (orbital, spin and quasispin), and
a generalized graphical technique. The latter allows us to calculate graphically the irreducible tensorial
products of the second quantization operators and their commutators, and to formulate additional rules
for operations with diagrams. The additional rules allow us to ﬁnd graphically the normal form of the
complicated tensorial products of the operators. All matrix elements (diagonal and non-diagonal with
respect to conﬁgurations) diﬀer only by the values of the projections of the quasispin momenta of separate
shells and are expressed in terms of completely reduced matrix elements (in all three spaces) of the second
quantization operators. As a result, it allows us to use standard quantities uniformly for both diagonal
and oﬀ-diagonal matrix elements.

Introduction

In order to obtain accurate values of atomic quantities it is necessary to account for relativistic and correla-
tion eﬀects. Relativistic eﬀects may be taken into account as Breit-Pauli corrections or, in a fully relativistic
approach, by starting with the Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian and wave functions deﬁned in terms of four-
component one-electron orbitals. In both cases, correlation eﬀects may be considered either variationally
or perturbatively. For complex atoms and ions, a considerable part of the eﬀort must be devoted to cop-
ing with integrations over spin-angular variables, occurring in the matrix elements of the operators under
consideration.

Many existing codes for integrating the spin-angular parts of matrix elements (Glass 1978, Glass and
Hibbert 1978, Grant 1988, Burke et al 1994) are based on the computational scheme proposed by Fano (1965).
In essence, it consists of evaluating recoupling matrices. Although such an approach uses Racah algebra, it
may be necessary to carry out multiple summations over intermediate terms. Due to these summations and
the complexity of the recoupling matrix itself, the associated computer codes become rather time consuming.
(1994). They tabulated separate standard parts of
A solution to this problem was found by Burke et al
recoupling matrices along with coeﬃcients of fractional parentage at the beginning of a calculation and used
them further on to calculate the needed coeﬃcients. Computer codes by Glass (1978), Glass and Hibbert
(1978), Grant (1988), Burke et al (1994) utilize the program NJSYM (Burke 1970) or NJGRAF (Bar-
Shalom and Klapisch 1988) for the calculation of recoupling matrices. Both are rather time consuming when
calculating matrix elements of complex operators or electronic conﬁgurations with many open subshells.

In order to simplify the calculations, Cowan (1981) suggested that matrix elements be grouped into
”Classes” (see Cowan 1981 Figure 13-5). Unfortunately, this approach was not generalized to all two-
electron operators. Perhaps for this reason Cowan’s approach is not widely used although the program itself,
based on this approach is widely used.

Many approaches for the calculation of spin-angular coeﬃcients (Glass 1978, Glass and Hibbert 1978,
Grant 1988, Burke et al 1994) are based on the usage of Racah algebra only on the level of coeﬃcients
of fractional parentage. A few authors (Jucys and Savukynas 1973, Cowan 1981) utilize the unit tensors,
simplifying the calculations in this way, because use can be made of the tables of unit tensors and selection
rules can be used to check whether the spin-angular coeﬃcients are zero prior to computation. Moreover,
the recoupling matrices themselves have a simpler form. Unfortunately, these ideas were applied only to
diagonal matrix elements with respect to conﬁgurations, though Cowan (1981) suggested the usage of unit
tensors for non-diagonal ones as well.

All the above mentioned approaches were applied in the coordinate representation. The second quan-
tization formalism (Judd 1967, Rudzikas and Kaniauskas 1984, Rudzikas 1991 and Rudzikas 1997) has a
number of advantages compared to coordinate representation. First of all, it is much easier to ﬁnd algebraic
expressions for complex operators and their matrix elements, when relying on second quantization formal-
ism. It has contributed signiﬁcantly to the successful development of perturbation theory (see Lindgren and
Morrison 1982, Merkelis et al 1985), and orthogonal operators (Uylings 1984), where three-particle operators
already occur. Uylings (1992) suggested a fairly simple approach for dealing with separate cases of three-
particle operators. Moreover, in the second quantization approach the quasispin formalism was eﬃciently
developed by Rudzikas and Kaniauskas (1984). The main advantage of this approach is that applying the
quasispin method for calculating the matrix elements of any operator, we can use the reduced coeﬃcients of
fractional parentage whose matrix elements are independent of the occupation number of the shell. All this
enabled Merkelis and Gaigalas (1985) to work out a general perturbation theory approach for complex cases
of several open shells.

Thus, it seems that it is possible to formulate an eﬃcient and general approach for ﬁnding the spin-
angular parts of matrix elements of atomic interactions, relying on the combination of the second quantization
approach in the coupled tensorial form, the generalized graphical technique and angular momentum theory
in orbital, spin and quasispin spaces as well as the symmetry properties of the quantities considered, which
would be free of previous shortcomings. Gaigalas and Rudzikas (1996) suggested such an approach for ﬁnding
matrix elements of any one- and two-particle atomic operator for the case of two open shells of equivalent
electrons. But the situation is diﬀerent when the matrix elements between more complex conﬁgurations are
considered.

An approach for the latter case is described in the present paper. One of the main ideas proposed here
allows one to solve the problems related to the more complex conﬁgurations. Namely, we propose to apply
Wick’s theorem (see Lindgren and Morrison 1982) not in its usual general form while calculating the matrix
elements, but rather only for groups of operators acting upon distinct shells of equivalent electrons. So, the
ordering of operators generally would not be normal.

It is a universal approach for ﬁnding algebraic expressions for matrix elements of any one- and two-particle
operator in the general case of an arbitrary number of subshells in an atomic conﬁguration, heavily based on
the exploitation of the quasispin technique and of the Wigner-Eckart theorem in quasispin space. Expressions
for matrix elements and recoupling matrices are obtained by ﬁrst classifying each matrix element into one of
four classes, depending on the number of subshells being acted upon. Each class is then further subdivided
into cases and explicit expressions derived for each case in terms of triangular conditions, nj-symbols, and
reduced matrix elements. From these expressions, eﬃcient procedures can be developed, that apply tests
before performing computation.

Tensorial expressions for any two-particle operator are presented in Section 2. They are based on the
underlying assumption that the second quantization operators (both creation and annihilation), acting on
the same open shell, must always be beside one another in a tensorial product and must be coupled into a
resultant momentum. Then the second quantization operators, acting on the next shell, must follow, etc.
Section 3 deals with the matrix elements between complex conﬁgurations. General expressions for recoupling
matrices were found (Section 4) by use of the modiﬁed graphical technique of Jucys and Bandzaitis (1977),
allowing us to calculate graphically the irreducible tensorial products of the second quantization operators
and their commutators, and to formulate additional rules for operations with diagrams. The additional rules
allow us to ﬁnd graphically the normal form of the complicated tensorial products of the operators. All the
graphical transformations we use here are fully described in Gaigalas and Rudzikas 1996.

Exploitation of this new version of Racah algebra based on the angular momentum theory, on a generalized
graphical approach, on quasispin approach, and on the use of reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage
for ﬁnding the spin-angular parts of two-particle operators is outlined in Sections 5-7. Some details of the
calculations are presented in the appendix.

2 Tensorial expressions for any two-particle operators

In order to be able to ﬁnd the expressions for matrix elements of the operators studied, we have to express
these operators in terms of the irreducible tensors or their irreducible products.
In this section we will
present all the necessary tensorial expressions for any two-particle operator G.

First, we express the operator in second-quantization form (Gaigalas and Rudzikas 1996) as

G =

where, as is customary, the creation operators aiaj appear to the left of the annihilation operators a†
j′ a†
i′
before deﬁning the shells upon which the second quantization operators are acting. After deﬁning the shells
explicitly, the second quantization operators are transformed using their commutation relations so that all
operators with the same nλ (λ ≡ l, s) are beside one another. For example, in the case where the electron
creation operator ai, and electron annihilation operators a†
j′ act upon the
same shell α, and operator aj acts upon another shell β, we have:

Here we imply that a tensorial structure indexed by (κ1κ2k, σ1σ2k) at g has rank κ1 for electron 1, rank κ2
for electron 2, and a resulting rank k in the l space, and corresponding ranks σ1σ2k in the s space.

In order to calculate the spin-angular part of a two-particle operator matrix element with an arbitrary
number of open shells, it is necessary to consider all possible distributions of subshells, upon which the second
quantization operators are acting. These are presented in Table 1. We point out that for distributions 2 – 5
and 19 – 42 the shells’ sequence numbers α, β, γ, δ (in bra and ket functions of a submatrix element) satisfy
the condition α < β < γ < δ, while for distributions 6 – 18 no conditions upon α, β, γ, δ are imposed.

Let Ξ be an array of intermediate coupling parameters in tensorial form, including κ12, σ12, κ′

possibly also others. Then the tensorial expressions for all these distributions can be grouped into four
classes, where in each class, the two-particle operator
G, operating on speciﬁc shells (see Eq. (1)), has one

presented in the Appendix, using the graphical approach of Gaigalas et al (1985). Graphical methods make
it possible to reduce the number of expressions from 42 to 6 for all distributions presented in Table 1. Such a
joining up of several distributions is possible by graphical means, because in the graphical technique of Jucys
and Bandzaitis (1977), as in the tensorial products of operators of second quantization, the main elements
are the Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcients. Therefore we may join up all the distributions having essentially the
same algebraic structure, although with diﬀerent tensorial products. The latter are represented by diagrams
in which all the pecularities of a tensorial product are seen, and the diﬀerences of particular distributions
are easily noticed. The use of other graphical methods (see e.g. Yutsis et al 1962 or Lindgren and Morrison
1982) in joining up the distributions is complicated, since there the Wigner coeﬃcients play the main role,
and these are not fully compatible with the graphical transformations of the operators of second quantization
in coupled form. Having classiﬁed the operators, we will now consider matrix elements of these operators
for arbitrary conﬁgurations.

3 Matrix elements between complex conﬁgurations

Now, having the irreducible tensorial form of the operator being considered, we are in a position to ﬁnd their
matrix elements and recoupling matrices. Suppose that we have a bra function with u shells in LS coupling:

all additional quantum numbers needed for the classiﬁcation of the energy levels of the relevant shell.

Using the Wigner-Eckart theorem in LS space we shift from the matrix element of any two-particle

operator G between functions (9) and (10) to the submatrix element (ψbra

As we have mentioned earlier, there are four classes as deﬁned by Eq.’s (5)-(8). We will consider each class
separately. All the expressions presented below are obtained by using the approach of angular momentum
theory described by Jucys and Bandzaitis (1977).

4.1 One interacting shell

on coeﬃcients of fractional parentage and have no intermediate summations. Therefore they will be very
convenient for practical calculations.

Expression (33) have also no analogue in Cowan (1981).
Thus, we have studied all possible cases of matrix elements of arbitrary two-electron operators. The
expressions for recoupling matrices ((22), (26) and (33)) obtained in this section are simpler and, thus, more
convenient for practical applications, than those of Cowan (1981), except for the simplest case k = 0 of an
operator acting on one shell (18), where they are equivalent.

We will discuss the derivation of submatrix elements of these operators, and present the expressions for
these quantities. It is worth noting that these tensorial quantities all act upon the same shell. So, all the
advantages of tensor algebra and the quasispin formalism may be exploited eﬃciently.

where the last multiplier in (39) is the so-called completely reduced (reduced in the quasispin, orbital and

is a Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient. Diﬀerent notations for it occur, e.g. Ajj1j2
Wigner (1931), (j1j2m1m2|j1j2jm) in Condon and Shortley (1935) or Judd (1967).

where F (κ1σ1) (nλ), G(κ2σ2) (nλ) is one of (34) or (35) and the submatrix elements correspondingly are deﬁned
by (39) and (33), (34) of Gaigalas and Rudzikas (1996). N ′′ is deﬁned by the second quantization operators
occurring in F (κ1σ1) (nλ) and G(κ2σ2) (nλ).

As is seen, by using this approach, the calculation of the angular parts of matrix elements between
functions with u open shells is reduced to requiring the submatrix elements of tensors (34) and (35) within
one shell of equivalent electrons. As these completely reduced submatrix elements do not depend on the
occupation number of the shell, the tables for these quantities are considerably reduced in size in comparison
with the tables of analogous submatrix elements of tensorial quantities U k, V k1k2 (Jucys and Savukynas
1973) and the tables of fractional parentage coeﬃcients.

In this section we present the phase factors ∆ in (11), which appear for submatrix elements of operators in
Eq. (5)-(8).

In the previous sections, all the expressions required to calculate the spin-angular part of any two-particle
operator were given. For convenience, the structure of the expressions (the numbers of the corresponding
formulas) are summarized in the Table 8 for each distribution given in the Table 1. The classiﬁcation numbers
of the distributions are presented in the ﬁrst column of the Table 8. The equation number of the tensorial
expression of the two-particle operator
G is given in the second column, and the equation number of the
tensorial class of the two-particle operator, denoted by

G(T ), in the third column.

In the next four columns are given the numbers of the formulas of the tensors, which act inside the shell.
b
A tensor acting upon the α shell is given in the α column, and in the columns β, γ, δ - upon the β, γ, δ shells,
,
respectively. Consequently, if we want to ﬁnd submatrix element, T
at ﬁrst we have to calculate the submatrix element of the tensor from column α between functions, consisting
(cid:1)
only of the α shell, and then to look for the submatrix element of the tensor from column β between functions,
consisting only of β shell, and so on. Thus, we need to calculate only submatrix elements of the tensors
acting upon a certain shell. The details of the calculation of these submatrix elements were discussed in the
Section 5.

8 Conclusions

The approach to matrix element evaluation that we present, is based on the the combination of the angular
momentum theory as described in Jucys and Bandzaitis (1977), on the concept of irreducible tensorial sets
(Judd 1967, Rudzikas and Kaniauskas 1984), on a generalized graphical approach (Gaigalas et al 1985), on
the quasispin approach (Rudzikas and Kaniauskas 1984), and on the use of reduced coeﬃcients of fractional
parentage (Rudzikas 1991, Rudzikas 1997, Judd 1996). All this, in its entity, introduces a number of new
features, in comparison with traditional approaches:

(1) The tensorial expressions of a two-particle operator, presented in Section 2, allow one to exploit all
the advantages of a new version of Racah algebra based on quasispin formalism when the latter is applied
within each particular shell only. In particular, this is not only a reformulation of spin-angular calculations
in terms of standard quantities, but also the determination beforehand from symmetry properties, of which
matrix elements are equal to zero without performing further explicit calculations. That is determined from
the submatrix elements T

j , Λbra, Λket, Ξ, Γ
(2) It enables one to use the Wigner-Eckart theorem in quasispin space. This provides an opportunity
to use tables of reduced coeﬃcients of fractional parentage and tables of other standard quantities (Section
5), which do not depend on the occupation number of a shell of equivalent electrons. Thus, the volume of
tables of standard quantities is reduced considerably in comparison with the analogous tables of submatrix
elements of tensorial operators U k, V k1 and the tables of fractional parentage coeﬃcients. This undoubtedly
makes the inclusion of shells of equivalent f electrons with arbitrary occupation numbers considerably easier,
and the process of selecting the standard quantities from the tables becomes simpler.

.

(3) The tensorial form of any operator presented in Section 2 allows one to obtain simple expressions for
the recoupling matrices (Section 4). Hence, the computer code based on this approach would use immedi-
ately the analytical formulas for recoupling matrices R
. This feature also saves
computing time, because i) complex calculations leading ﬁnally to simple analytical expressions (Bar-Shalom
and Klapisch 1988) are avoided, and ii) a number of momenta triads (triangular conditions) can be checked
before the explicit calculation of a recoupling matrix leading to a zero value. These triangular conditions
may be determined not only for the terms of shells that the operators of second quantization act upon, as
is the case for the submatrix elements T
(see conclusion 1), but also
for the rest of the shells and resulting terms.

In this approach both diagonal and non-diagonal with respect to conﬁgurations, matrix elements are
considered in a uniform way, and are expressed in terms of the same quantities. The diﬀerence is only in the
values of the projections of the quasispin momenta of separate shells.

In this paper all the expressions needed in the spin-angular parts of matrix elements of two-particle
operators calculation are presented. This approach is applicable to one-particle operators as well. While
calculating the spin-angular parts of the latter, all the expressions needed are included in the cases discussed
for the two-particle operator. For instance, in the recoupling matrix calculation two of the four cases discussed
above appear, namely, when all the second quantization operators act upon the same shell (Section 4.1) and
when they act upon two diﬀerent shells of equivalent electrons (Section 4.2). Thus, this approach is applicable
to any one- and two-particle operator. Practical usage shows that a series of diﬃculties persisting in the
traditional approach to the calculation of angular parts of matrix elements based on the usage of coeﬃcients of
fractional parentage and unit tensors can be avoided and high eﬃciency may be achieved. Indeed, preliminary
calculations show that computer programs based on our approach on average are 4-6 times faster than the
other well-known codes (Gaigalas et al 1995). This methodology can easily be generalized to cover the case
of relativistic operators and relativistic wave functions.

Appendix

Here algebraic expressions are presented for the two-particle operator (1) in the irreducible tensorial form
for all the distributions from Table 8. Although there are quite a few distributions, the structure of their
algebraic formulas is similar, and therefore on the basis of a graphical approach (Gaigalas et al 1985) the
expressions may be written down in a compact form, where one general formula includes all the cases having
the same structure. Each particular formula is obtained from these by performing elementary graphical
transformations according to the rules explained below. The general expressions are:

(1) Distribution αααα (case 1 from Table 8):
For this distribution the analytical expressions (7), (8) in Gaigalas and Rudzikas (1996) are used, in
j acquire particular values of a shell α. For the ﬁrst form

operators when this operator has distribution αααα. Diagrams A4 and A5 represent two-particle operators
for all others distributions. Diagrams A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 are similar to the usual Feynman-Goldstone
diagrams. Diagrams A6, A7 and A8 represent tensorial products of second quantization operators (A6 for
the second group, A7 for the third, and A8 for the fourth.).

The ﬁnal analytical expressions for diagram A6 appearing in (50), diagram A7 in (52) and diagram A8 in
(54), are obtained after the following graphical transformations:

(i) The second quantization operators are interchanged, until (from left to right) ﬁrst come the operators

acting upon shell α , then correspondingly upon β, γ, δ.

(ii) The generalized Clebsch-Gordan coeﬃcient is transformed to match the order of operators. This is
performed by changing the order of angular momenta coupling at some of the nodes 1, 2, 3 (Figure 1,
A6, A7 and A8).

We write down immediately the algebraic expressions for diagrams A6, A7 and A8 (of Figure 1) after
transformation (i) and (ii) by applying usual generalized graphical technique (see Gaigalas et al 1985). Also
we have to notice that Θ′ is equal to ˜Θ with a phase factor, which is found by transforming the diagram of
the tensorial structure according to the rules (i) and (ii). Only in cases 1 and 7-10 (see Table 8) is Θ′ ≡ ˜Θ,
because there is no need to transform the tensorial structure.

* *

*

As an example, let us consider in particular the case where operator aj acts upon the ﬁrst shell n1λ1,
operator ai acts upon the second shell n2λ2, and operators a†
j′ act upon the third shell n3λ3 (see Eq.
(1)). This is the distribution 18 in Table 8. We obtain the algebraic expression for distribution βαγγ from
(52). The two-particle operator for this distribution can be represented by diagram B1 which is proportional
to its tensorial part (diagram B2) as (Figure 2 B1, B2):

Now using (67) and (68) we can write down the irreducible tensorial form for the Coulomb operator with

tensorial structure κ1 = κ2 =k, σ1 = σ2 = 0, k = 0 and the two-electron submatrix element:

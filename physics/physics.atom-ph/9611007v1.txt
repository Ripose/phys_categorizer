Abstract

We consider the coherent population trapping phenomenon in a thermal

sodium atomic beam. We compare the diﬀerent coherent population trapping

schemes that can be established on the D1 line using the Zeeman sublevels

of a given ground hyperﬁne state. The coherent population trapping prepa-

ration is examined by means of a Hanle eﬀect conﬁguration. The eﬃciency

of the coherent population trapping phenomenon has been examined in pres-

ence of optical pumping into hyperﬁne levels external to those of the excited

transition. We show that both the contrast and the width of the coherent

population trapping resonance strongly decrease when the optical pumping

rate is increased. In the experiment, the loss rate due to optical pumping has

been controlled by means of a laser repump of variable intensity.

I. INTRODUCTION

Recently the Coherent Population Trapping (CPT) phenomenon has received a large

interest, also in connection with its applications, for example the laser cooling below the

recoil limit or lasing without inversion (see [1] for a review). At the beginning CPT theo-

retical studies were restricted to the three-level Λ-system [2,3], but recently they have been

extended to diﬀerent atom-light interaction schemes [4,5]. Despite the large amount of data

available on the CPT phenomenon exploited in several atom-light interaction schemes, the

features related to diﬀerent level schemes and established on a given atomic species, have

never been directly compared. On the other hand, the increasing interest for CPT appli-

cations requires realistic calculations taking in account processes as the loss towards the

external states, the Doppler broadening of the absorbing transition, the collisions, all of

them present in the experiment and determining the strength of the CPT resonance.

The main goal of the present investigation is to study the dependence of the CPT phe-

nomenon on the atom-laser interaction parameters. In this paper we focus our attention

on the level schemes that can be established on the sodium D1 line using as ground states

the Zeeman sublevels of the same hyperﬁne component. We investigate theoretically and

experimentally the CPT features associated to the diﬀerent hyperﬁne optical transitions.

As shown in Fig. 1, the hyperﬁne transitions composing the D1 line are: Fg = 1

transitions, only a limited number of Zeeman sublevels contribute to the preparation of the

CPT coherent superposition of states, and precisely those connected by heavy lines in Fig.

1. For instance the Fg = 1

Fe = 1 transition contains a Λ system that excited by σ+, σ−

light produces the coherent superposition of ground states not interacting with the laser ra-

diation. The Fg = 2

Fe = 2 transition contains a M system that again excited by σ+, σ−

light produces a coherent superposition of three ground states not interacting with the laser

radiation. For the transition Fg = 2

Fe = 1 both the coherent dark superpositions listed

above for the Fg = 1

Fe = 1 and Fg = 2

Fe = 2 transitions are present. Finally

the transition Fg = 1

Fe = 2 is not relevant for CPT in the σ+, σ− light conﬁguration,

→

because it does not contain a coherent superposition noncoupled to the laser ﬁeld.

The experiment is based on the laser excitation of a sodium atomic beam. To produce

CPT in the sodium atoms and to investigate its production we have used a Hanle eﬀect

conﬁguration. The sodium atoms are excited by monochromatic linearly polarised laser light

resonant with an hyperﬁne optical transition; the degeneracy of the ground state Zeeman

sublevels is removed by the introduction of an external magnetic ﬁeld parallel to the laser

propagation direction. For zero magnetic ﬁeld the atomic system is optically pumped into a

coherent superposition of ground states non interacting with the laser ﬁeld, i.e., the dark or

noncoupled state. For a ﬁxed laser frequency, scanning the external magnetic ﬁeld around

the zero value, the atomic ﬂuorescence emitted at right angles with respect to the directions

of the laser ﬁeld propagation and of the magnetic ﬁeld exhibits a minimum at zero magnetic

ﬁeld with a lineshape dip typical of the Hanle/CPT phenomenon.

We have measured the contrast and the linewidth of the resonance in the Hanle/CPT

lineshape versus the intensity of applied laser ﬁeld. These measurements are compared to

analytical and numerical analyses. For a closed optical transition the CPT process is quite

straightforwardly understood and described in the frame of the optical Bloch equations.

With an atomic sample in an initial uniform Zeeman distribution, the atomic preparation

into the coherent superposition increases with a time constant determined by the optical

pumping rate into the noncoupled state. For an open optical transition, i.e., in the presence

of atomic levels external to the hyperﬁne transition resonant with the laser light, the atomic

preparation into the coherent superposition is modiﬁed by the optical pumping into those

levels. The atomic time evolution is governed by the competition between optical pumping

into the noncoupled state and the optical pumping into the external hyperﬁne states.

We have investigated, both theoretically and experimentally, how the contrast and

linewidth features of the CPT resonance depend on the optical pumping rate towards the

external levels. In eﬀect for the diﬀerent hyperﬁne optical transitions of the sodium D1 line,

owing to their diﬀerent optical pumping rates, the CPT resonances have diﬀerent linewidths

3

and contrasts. The optical pumping rate into external levels may be compensated by the

application of a repumping laser of variable intensity. Thus we have studied the CPT fea-

tures of a given scheme of hyperﬁne levels as a function of the external optical pumping

loss rate by applying a repumping laser of variable intensity. Some of our results, as the

narrow linewidth realized on open transitions, can be applied to the magnetometry based

on coherent population trapping recently introduced by Wynands et al [6].

Our investigation should be compared to previous CPT studies. The more recent and

detailed investigation of the CPT resonance has been performed by Ling et al [7]. Previous

accurate studies of the Hanle eﬀect in the ground state [8–12] have examined the lineshape

dependence on the laser intensity. However none of those studies analysed the role of the

diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions as presented here. Ling et al [7] have examined the role of

the Doppler broadening on CPT. Their results show that in our experiment the Doppler

broadening associated to the residual divergence of the sodium atomic beam has a negligible

inﬂuence on the measured contrast and linewidth. Thus we have not included the Doppler

broadening in our analysis. In the comparison between our data and the theoretical analysis

we have discovered that our measured contrast could not reach the theoretical value because

the magnetic ﬁeld compensation was not accurate as required. On the contrary in the

experiment by Picqu´e [12] the very good magnetic ﬁeld compensation allowed the author

to reach the contrast predicted by the theory. Thus we have used the data of ref. [12] for

completing the comparison with our theoretical analysis.

In the present work Section II contains a theoretical analysis of the CPT process based

on the analytical and numerical solution of the optical Bloch equations. Section III describes

the experimental setup and the experimental results. Section IV contains the comparison

between the theoretical analysis and the experimental results. In Section V conclusions are

presented.

In order to examine the inﬂuence of the external levels on the Hanle/CPT resonance

around zero magnetic ﬁeld, we have solved numerically the time-dependent OBE with the

initial condition ρgi,gj (t = 0) = 1

8δij, ρgi,ej (t = 0) = ρei,ej (t = 0) = 0. We have calculated the

time-dependent ﬂuorescence intensity emitted from the atomic system

In our experiment on an atomic beam, we detect a signal proportional to the integrated

ﬂuorescence intensity emitted by an atom interacting with the laser light during a time tf

In the case of a closed atomic system, if the time-integrated detected signal corresponds

to a long interaction times tf , the transient initial regime produces a negligible contribution

to the overall intensity. The contrast, between the maximum and the minimum of the

emitted ﬂuorescence intensity, deﬁned as in ref. [1,16], approaches hundred percent when all

the atoms are pumped into the noncoupled state. In the case of an open system the excited

state occupation at the steady state is equal to zero: all population is lost because of the

presence of the external state. In this case the transient regime produces the most important

contribution to the integrated emitted intensity, which exhibits a Hanle/CPT resonance with

contrast strongly depending on the atomic transition. Fig. 2 shows results for I versus B at

diﬀerent interaction times and Iint versus B at tf = 45/ΓFe=1→Fg=1 for the Fg = 1

hyperﬁne transition of the D1 line, at diﬀerent values of αFe→Fg;F

and (b) corresponds to an ideal close transition, the case αFe=1→Fg=1;F

′ =2 = 5 of (c) and

(d) corresponds to the real Fg = 1

Fe = 1 transition of the D1 line. In (a) and (b) for

→

the case of a closed atomic system, where αFe→Fg;F

′ = 0, the time-dependent ﬂuorescence

g

intensity exhibits a sharp and well pronounced Hanle/CPT resonance around zero magnetic

g

g

ﬁeld. The contrast of Iint increases with the interaction time and results around 100 %

at larger interaction times. In (c) and (d) a large loss towards external states produces a

reduced intensity I, and a smaller contrast in the integrated intensity Iint. The limiting

value for the contrast observed on I is 100 percent independently of the loss rate and is

reached at interaction times shorter than in the case of a closed system, because only those

atoms already in the noncoupled state contribute to the contrast, the remaining ones been

pumped into the external states. The integrated ﬂuorescence Iint is obtained summing up

the contributions at diﬀerent times, and those at earlier times have a larger weight on the

sum. Also for an open system the contrast increases with the interaction time, reaching a

value smaller than 100 % at larger interaction times.

Fig. 3 shows the results for the integrated ﬂuorescence intensity Iint in the case of the

real open transitions of sodium, for a choice of experimental parameters corresponding to

the conditions of the experimental investigation. The diﬀerent contrast of the Hanle/CPT

7

resonance for the diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions is quite evident. A large contrast is obtained

for the Fg = 2

Fe = 1 transition with the smallest value of losses towards external states.

→

The results of Figs. 2,3 show that the loss towards the external states modiﬁes strongly

also the linewidth. In Fig. 2 the resonance linewidth for the case of αFe=1→Fg=1;F

′ =2 = 5 is

g

much narrower than the linewidth for the case α = 0. In Fig 3 the real hyperﬁne transitions

are directly compared and once again open transitions with a larger loss towards external

states have a more narrow resonance. The comparison between diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions

is not straightforward because the matrix element Ve,g of the atom-laser interaction between

excited and ground states depends on the hyperﬁne levels, and furthermore in the system

Fg = 2

Fe = 1 two noncoupled states are present. However the CPT analysis for a closed

→

symmetrical Λ system performed in the basis of the coupled and noncoupled states is very

usedul for the interpretation. In that analysis [1,16], in absence of ground state relaxation,

at the steady state the linewidth of the CPT resonance is determined by the loss rate Γ′ of

the coupled state, with Γ′ = Ve,g/(¯h2Γexc), Γexc being the excited state lifetime. In Fig. 2,

the main diﬀerence between the closed, in (a) and (b), and open, in (c) and (d), systems

is the excited state lifetime, with Γexc = Γ1→1 in the ﬁrst case, and Γexc = Γ1→1α1→1;2 in

the second case. An increase in that lifetime produces a smaller Γ′ and a more narrow CPT

resosnce, as observed in the ﬁgure for both I and Iint. It should be noted that in an open

system the coupled-noncoupled approach applied to states without population because of

the optical pumping towards external states is not really meaningful.

The narrow linewidths obtained in Fig. 3 have a diﬀerent explanation, because for the

real D1 line hyperﬁne transitions the excited states have the same lifetime Γ, whichever

Zeeman/hyperﬁne component. The narrow resonances are obtained in the curve of Iint

versus B and the contribution of I at diﬀerent interaction times should be considered. They

arise because of the simultaneous action of the pumping into the noncoupled nonabsorbing

state and of the optical pumping towards external states. The optical pumping towards

external states is less eﬃcient whenever the optical pumping in the noncoupled states is

more eﬃcient:

in the noncoupled state the atomic wavefunction hsa no contribution of

8

excited state, whence the atom does not decay towards the external states. Thus the narrow

CPT resonance, being produced by the contribution of only those atoms remaining in the

noncoupled state and nondecaying towards the external states, is a consequence of an atomic

selection.

III. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

The experimental setup is shown in Fig. 4. We used a single mode CW dye laser; the

light polarization was linear and the propagation direction orthogonal to the thermal sodium

atomic beam. An external magnetic ﬁeld was applied parallel to the laser beam propagation

direction. Magnetic ﬁeld Helmholtz coils, applied around the atom-laser interaction region,

were driven by a programmable power supply in order to produce a linear scan of the mag-

netic ﬁeld. The earth magnetic ﬁeld was compensated to better than 0.05 G by additional

pairs of Helmholtz coils. By tuning the laser to diﬀerent hyperﬁne optical transitions of the

sodium D1 line, we excited diﬀerent atomic conﬁgurations. The laser frequency was tuned

to the center of the homogeneous hyperﬁne absorption proﬁle. The ﬂuorescence signal emit-

ted by the sodium atoms at right angles with respect to the directions of the laser ﬁeld

propagation and of the magnetic ﬁeld was detected through a photomultiplier and recorded

by means of a lock-in ampliﬁer and a standard data acquisition system. In our experiment

the interaction time was of the order of few µs, to be compared to the 3P1/2 excited state

lifetime of sixteen ns.

IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND COMPARISON WITH THEORY

Examples of the time integrated ﬂuorescence signals recorded on the diﬀerent hyperﬁne

transitions are shown in Fig. 5. Three of the four transitions on the D1 line exhibit the

Hanle/CPT typical dip. The transition Fg = 1

Fe = 2 does not exhibit any dip because

there are no noncoupled states into which the atom could be pumped. The dip contrasts

for the other three transitions, Fg = 1

Fe = 1, Fg = 2

Fe = 1, Fg = 2

Fe = 2, are

→

→

→

→

9

very diﬀerent. The dip for the transition Fg = 2

Fe = 1 is very pronounced, and the

→

corresponding contrast is large. The contrasts of the dips associated with the transitions

Fg = 1

Fe = 1 and Fg = 2

Fe = 2 are smaller. The observed behaviours correspond

→

→

to those predicted by the analysis and shown in Fig. 2. The hyperﬁne transitions with a

larger loss factor α towards external states present a more narrow Hanle/CPT resonance.

However it should be noted that diﬀerent hyperﬁne transitions cannot be directly compared

as already discussed.

The FWHM linewidth and the contrast of the Hanle/CPT resonance for the various

hyperﬁne transitions have been studied as a function of the laser intensity. The experimental

results are shown in Fig. 6 and 7a. The experimental results of Figs. 6 and 7a for the

linewidth and contrast of the Hanle/CPT resonance have been compared to the theoretical

numerical analysis. The theory predicts an increase of the linewidth and contrast with

the applied laser intensity, as observed in the experiment. However the maximum contrast

achieved in our experimental observations is lower than that predicted by the theory. For

instance for the Fg = 2

Fe = 1 hyperﬁne transition, the maximum theoretical contrast is

→

sixtyseven percent, while the measured value of the maximum contrast on that transition is

around ﬁfty percent. In order to examine more carefully the comparison between theory and

experiments, our theoretical analysis has been applied also to the Hanle/CPT measurements

published by Picqu´e [12] in an experimental conﬁguration very similar to the present one,

on the Fg = 2

Fe = 1 hyperﬁne transition of the sodium D1 line as a function of the

→

applied laser ﬁeld intensity. The contrast of the Hanle/CPT resonances, as derived from

the ﬁve curves published in [12], and the results of a theoretical analysis for the interaction

times of that reference are reported in Fig. 7b. In this case the agreement between our

theory and the experimental results is very good, conﬁrming the validity of the theoretical

approach. The experiment of [12] reported a compensation of the stray magnetic ﬁelds

within 10 mG over the whole atom-laser interaction volume. Thus our failure to reproduce

the theoretical contrast is produced by an imperfect compensation of the magnetic ﬁeld in

our apparatus. More precisely owing to the presence of some magnetic ﬁeld gradient present

10

in the atom-laser interaction region, the magnetic ﬁeld could not be compensated over the

whole interaction region through our Helmholtz coils.

For the D1 excitation on sodium atoms none of the hyperﬁne optical transitions is closed.

However experimentally a closed-like situation can be realized through the application of

a repumping laser which compensates the losses term ˙ρeiei =

αFe→Fg;F

′ ΓFe→Fgρeiei for

−

g

the population decay. We examined, for a given transition, the dependence of contrast and

linewidth on the population loss rate, by applying a repumping laser to partially compensate

the losses towards external states. Varying the intensity of the repumping laser it was

possible to study the features of the CPT resonance as a function of the rate of population

losses. Obviously the repumping transition should be chosen in order to not produce an

additional noncoupled coherent superposition. In the case of the sodium D1 line the most

favourable transition for this study is the Fg = 2

Fe = 2 transition because the transition

→

Fg = 1

Fe = 2, without noncoupled state, as veriﬁed by the record in Fig. 5d, can

→

be used for repumping. The CPT results in presence of a repumping laser are reported in

Fig. 8: it is clearly visible that the contrast and the width of the CPT resonance increase

for increasing power of the repumping laser, i.e., for a decreasing rate of population losses.

These experimental results can be compared to the theoretical ones of Fig. 2. The presence

of a repumping laser, compensating for the losses towards external states, is equivalent to a

longer lifetime of the excited state. Thus starting from the conﬁguration of an open system

as in Fig. 2(b) in absence of the repumping laser, its application produces an eﬀective closed

system as in Fig. 2(a). It should be noted that the repumping laser does not compensate

for the decay rate of the optical coherences. However after preparation of the atoms in the

noncoupled states, the optical coherences are zero and their decay is not relevant for the

atomic preparation.

V. CONCLUSIONS

The CPT phenomenonon the sodium D1 line has been investigated by means of an Hanle

eﬀect conﬁguration comparing diﬀerent level schemes (Λ and M) and studying the inﬂuence

of the losses towards external states. Diﬀerent atom-laser interaction schemes involving as

ground states the sublevels of the same hyperﬁne component have been considered. On the

sodium D1 line the relevant transition are Fg = 1

Fe = 1, Fg = 2

Fe = 1, Fg = 2

→
Fe = 2. As original contribution of the present investigation we have investigated CPT in

→

→

atomic conﬁgurations not closed for spontaneous emissions decay. We have demonstrated

that CPT may be realized on those open transition with an eﬃciency decreasing with the

amount of spontaneous emission towards external states. Because in the D1 line the diﬀerent

level conﬁgurations correspond to diﬀerent rates of population losses, the features, i.e.,

width and contrast, of the Hanle/CPT resonance depend on the explored transition. A

careful study of the dependence of the width and contrast of the Hanle/CPT dip on the

interaction parameters has been performed. A numerical analysis of the density matrix

equations conﬁrms most experimental observations, except that the maximum contrast is

lower than the expected one because of the not perfect compensation of the magnetic ﬁeld in

the experiment. However our numerical analysis is in agreement with the contrast measured

in a previous experiment [12] where a very good magnetic ﬁeld compensation was applied.

The experimental data show that the contrast of the Hanle/CPT dip is less than 100 %.

It depends strongly on the population loss rate and it can be controlled by means of a

repumping laser that compensates the rate of population losses towards the external levels.

The contrast of the Hanle/CPT resonance is only weakly aﬀected by the small Doppler

broadening associated to the atomic beam.

Note that in the regime of very large saturation, the power broadening of the spectral

lines does not allow the interpretation of the experiment as a pure Fg →
′ . Let us consider for example the case of Fg = 1
losses on Fg

Fe transition with

Fe = 1 (Λ-scheme). At large

→

laser saturation the absorption lines Fg = 1

Fe = 1 and Fg = 1

Fe = 2 are excited

→

→

12

simultaneously. Thus we don’t have a pure Λ-system but a Λ + W system where the states

are not completely dark for the laser absorption.

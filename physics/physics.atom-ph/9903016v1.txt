Abstract. Absolute two-photon detachment cross sections and photoelectron
angular distribution are calculated for halogen negative ions within lowest-order
perturbation theory. The Dyson equation method is used to obtain the outer np
ground-state wave functions with proper asymptotic behavior P (r)

κ2/2m. The latter is
corresponding to correct (experimental) binding energies Eb = ¯h
crucial for obtaining correct absolute values of the multiphoton cross sections (Gribakin

Introduction

Halogen negative ions have been subject of experimental and theoretical multiphoton
detachment studies for over thirty years (Hall et al 1965, Robinson and Geltman
1967). Apart from the negative hydrogen ion which traditionally receives a lot of
attention, especially from theorists, they are deﬁnitely the most studied negative ions.
Nevertheless, there are very few ﬁrmly established results on the absolute values of
the cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions in multiphoton processes.
A number of experimental works reports the cross sections and angular asymmetry
parameters measured in two-photon detachment at selected photon energies in F− and
Cl− (Trainham et al 1987, Blondel et al 1989, 1992, Kwon et al 1989, Davidson et al
1992, Sturrus et al 1992, Blondel and Delsart 1993). For heavier halogen ions, Br− and
I−, the experimental data are scarce (Hall et al 1965, Blondel et al 1992, Blondel and
Delsart 1993).

On the theoretical side, there were pioneering two-photon detachment calculations
by Robinson and Geltman (1967) performed using a model potential approach, and
a number of other perturbation-theory calculations employing the Hartree-Fock (HF)
approximation for the ionic ground state, and either plane or HF waves for the
photoelectron in the continuum (Crance 1987a,b, 1988). The latter were applied to
study n-photon detachment cross sections and photoelectron angular distributions from
halogen negative ions for n up to ﬁve. Jiang and Starace (1988) used a transition-matrix
approach and examined the contribution of the lowest-order correlation processes in
the two-photon detachment from Cl−. They showed that the role of correlations is
small just above the threshold but increases with the photon energy and reaches about
20%, compared with the HF result. Later on Pan et al (1990) and Pan and Starace
(1991) performed similar calculations of the two-photon detachment cross section and
angular distribution for F−. Using ﬁrst-order perturbation theory in electron interaction
they included more correlation corrections and estimated the contribution of the many-
electron eﬀects at 10 to 20% in the cross sections, but almost negligible in the angular
distribution asymmetry parameters. More recently van der Hart (1996) used the R-
matrix Floquet theory to calculate multiphoton detachment from F− and Cl−. He
found a discrepancy with the results of the transition-matrix approach in F− and Cl−
within about 30%.

In the above works, except that of Robinson and Geltman, the halogen ion ground
state was described either in the HF, or in a few-state conﬁguration interaction
approximation. Consequently, the binding energy of the outer electron, as obtained
from the calculation, was never in good agreement with the experimental electron
aﬃnity, and experimental energy values were used in the calculations of the multiphoton
amplitudes and cross sections. On the other hand, the asymptotic behaviour of the

3

(1)

ground-state wave function in these calculations remained incorrect. This may seem
to have introduced only a small error in the calculation, since the bound-state wave
function in the asymptotic region is small. However, as shown in the adiabatic theory of
multiphoton detachment from negative ions (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a, 1997b), the
asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave function is crucial for obtaining correct
absolute values of the probabilities of multiphoton processes. This theory based on the
Keldysh approach (Keldysh 1964) approach shows that the electron escape from the
atomic system in a low-frequency laser ﬁeld takes place at large distances,

where ω is the photon frequency, κ is related to the initial bound state energy, E0 =

Accordingly, the multiphoton detachment rates are basically determined by the long-
range asymptotic behaviour of the bound-state wave function, namely by parameters

The analytical adiabatic approach is valid for multiphoton detachment processes, i.e.,
1. However, the calculations for H− and halogen negative ions
strictly speaking, for n
indicate (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a, Kuchiev and Ostrovsky 1998) that the analytical
formulae should give reasonable answers even for n = 2. To verify these conclusions we
performed direct numerical calculations of the two-photon detachment cross section of
ﬂuorine F− negative ion (Gribakin et al 1998) within the lowest order of perturbation
theory and compared the results obtained with diﬀerent ground-state wavefunctions. We
demonstrated explicitly the sensitivity of the cross sections to the asymptotic behaviour
of the bound-state wave function and showed that the true cross section should be
substantially higher than it was previously believed, based on calculations with the
HF 2p wavefunction. Moreover, the use of the ground-state wavefunction with correct
asymptotic behaviour in multiphoton detachment calculations is often more important
than other eﬀects of electron correlations.

In our previous work the asymptotically correct 2p wavefunction was obtained using
a model potential chosen to reproduce the experimental value of the 2p-electron energy.
Of course, any model-potential approach is not free from ambiguities related to the
choice of the potential. The aim of present work is to perform more accurate calculations
of the two-photon detachment in negative halogen ions using correct np wavefunctions
obtained within the many-body Dyson equation method (see, e.g. Chernysheva et al
1988). Section 2 brieﬂy outlines the method of calculation. A discussion of our results
and comparisons with other calculations and experimental data are presented in Section
3.

outer np electron from the negative halogen ion np6 1S the ﬁnal state can be either 1S
(L = 0, lf = 1) or 1D (L = 2, lf = 1, 3). In the lowest 2nd order the two-photon

(lf = 1), and L = 2 for the ﬁnal-state f wave (lf = 3). The intermediate state continua
are discretized and represented by a 70-state momentum mesh with constant spacing
∆k.

2.2. Ground-state wavefunction

If one describes the initial state n0l0 in the HF approximation, the asymptotic behaviour
of the corresponding radial wavefunction is incorrect. Namely, it is characterized by κ
corresponding to the HF binding energy, rather than the exact (experimental) one. For
example, in F− the HF value is κ = 0.6, whereas the true one is κ = 0.5. As we have
shown (Gribakin et al 1998) is in fact much more important to have an asymptotically
correct bound-state wavefucntion Pn0l0 than to use correct initial state energy E0 in
equation (4). The need for an asymptotically correct wavefunction was also clearly
illustrated by the adiabatic hyperspherical calculation of multiphoton detachment from
H− by Liu et al (1992), where a 3.4% change of κ resulted in a 25% change of the two-
photon cross section. In our previous paper we corrected the 2p wavefunction by solving
the HF equations for the F− ground state with a small additional repulsive potential of
the form V (r) = α/[2(r2 + a2)2], where the parameters α and a were chosen to ensure
that the calculated energy was equal to the experimental value. Our choice α = 1 and
a = 0.61 ensured κ = 0.5, and produced the asymptotic parameter A = 0.86, close to
the value recommended by Radtsig and Smirnov (1986).

In this work we reﬁne the bound-state wavefunction using atomic many-body theory
methods. The latter enable one to obtain a quasi-particle orbital which describes the
bound electron in a many-body system from the Dyson equation (see, e.g., Chernysheva
et al 1988, Gribakin et al 1990, where it is applied to calculations of negative ions)

Here H (0) is the single-particle HF Hamiltonian and ΣE is the self-energy of the single-
particle Green’s function. This energy-dependent non-local operator plays the role of
a correlation potential, and, if known exactly, produces exact bound-state energies
In most applications ΣE is calculated by means of perturbation-
from equation (8).
theory expansion, and the lowest second-order contribution usually gives a considerable
improvement on the HF results. Note that in some sense the Dyson equation provides

6

the best single-particle orbital of the initial state for photodetachment calculations.
Because it is in fact a quasiparticle orbital, it incorporates certain many-body eﬀects,
namely, the ground-state correlations leading to the correct binding energy.

For all halogen negative ions the HF binding energies of the outer np subshell are
greater than the corresponding experimental electron aﬃnities. Hence, the correlation
correction to the energy must be positive, which means a repulsive correlation potential.
Indeed, our numerical calculations show that ΣE is dominated by the direct contribution

the occupied states is basically given by n1 = n2 = np (in many-body theory language
this means that both holes are the outer np subshell).
It is obvious then that this

contribution has Eν1 −
(for a = b = np) in the numerator, it is explicitly positive.

It also follows from our calculations that ΣE calculated in the second-order
approximation overestimates the correlation correction. Therefore, to obtain best
ground-state orbitals for multiphoton detachment calculations we introduce a free
parameter η before the (dominant) direct term in the second sum of equation (9). This
parameter is then chosen to reproduce experimental values of the np energies from the
Dyson equation. Moreover, using diﬀerent values of η we can eﬀectively simulate the
ﬁne-structure splitting, and obtain the wavefunctions for both ﬁne-structure components
of the np6 subshell, the upper np3/2 and lower np1/2, corresponding to the diﬀerent
binding energies. For heavier halogen negative ions (Br and I) the splitting between
them becomes quite signiﬁcant, and we account for diﬀerent asymptotic behaviour of the
corresponding radial wavefunctions in calculations of multiphoton processes. Since we
use ΣE from equation (9) in this semiempirical way, only the contributions of dominant
monopole and dipole atomic excitations are included in the sums.

Note that the importance of large distances in multiphoton problems (Gribakin
and Kuchiev 1997a, 1997b) supports the use of the length form of the photon dipole
operator. This is in agreement with the results of Pan et al (1990) who showed that
the two-photon detachment cross sections obtained with the dipole operator in the

velocity form are much more sensitive to the shift of the photodetachment threshold
and correlation corrections, while the length form results are much more robust.

The two-photon amplitudes Mlf l (4) are calculated by direct summation over the
intermediate states.
It involves accurate evaluation of the free-free dipole matrix
elements, and special attention is paid to pole- and δ-type singularities of the integrand
(Korol 1994, 1997).

The main diﬀerence between the present calculation and our previous work (Gribakin et
al 1998) is in the initial state 2p wavefunction. The self-consistent HF calculation of the
F− ground state yields the 2p-electron energy EHF
0.362 Ryd, much lower than its
true value equal to the negative of the experimental electron aﬃnity of F: Eexp
0.250
Ryd (Hotop and Lineberger 1986). In the previous work we used a model potential which
reproduced the experimental energy, and yielded a 2p wave function with the asymptotic
parameters A = 0.86 and κ = 0.5 (cf. A = 0.94 and κ = 0.6 for the HF wavefunction).
In the present work we obtain the 2p wavefunction from the Dyson equation (8).
When ΣE is calculated within the second order, equation (9), the 2p energy equal
0.187 Ryd is obtained. Thus, the second-order approximation overestimates the
to
strength of the polarization potential. When a scaling factor η = 0.67 is introduced in
the way outlined in Sec. 2.2, we reproduce the experimental energy for the 2p electron,
and obtain an accurate Dyson orbital of the 2p subshell. This 2p wavefunction is quite
close to the HF one inside the atom, whereas for r > 2 au it goes higher than the HF
solution. Its asymptotic behaviour is characterized by κ = 0.5 and A = 0.64. The latter
value of A together with our best asymptotic parameters of the np orbitals of the other
ions are presented in Table 1, where they are compared with values recommended by
Radtsig and Smirnov (1986) and Nikitin and Smirnov (1988). The latter were obtained
by matching the HF wave function with that possessing a correct asymptotic behaviour.
Unlike the use of the Dyson equation with the many-body correlation potential (even if
somewhat adjusted), this procedure is not free from ambiguities. They manifest in the
diﬀerences between A values from the two sources cited.

The results of calculations of the two-photon detachment cross section and
photoelectron angular distribution in F− are presented in ﬁgures 1 and 2. Our results
obtained using the HF 2p orbital (the HF two-photon threshold is at ω = 0.181 Ryd)
are about 10% higher than the similar dipole length lowest-order HF results of Pan et
al (1990). A possible source of this discrepancy was discussed in our previous paper
(Gribakin et al 1998), where we proposed that it could be associated with the fact that
Pan et al (1990) used the Roothaan-HF expansion of the bound state. According to

them electron correlation eﬀects suppress the cross section in F− by about 20% at the
maximum.

When we use the experimental energy of the 2p electron together with the HF
wavefunctions the magnitude of the two-photon cross section changes very little, as
seen earlier by Pan et al (1990) for both HF and correlated results (dotted line in ﬁgure
1). The HF results of Crance (1987a) are close to the above. The cross section of van der
Hart (1996) obtained within the R-matrix Floquet approach is 30% higher (dash-dotted
line in ﬁgure 1) with a maximum of σ = 1.25 au at ω = 0.166 Ryd.

However, when we use the 2p wavefunction with the correct asymptotic behaviour
from the Dyson equation, the photodetachment cross section increases about two
times.
. This cross section is shown by solid line in ﬁgure 1, and we consider this

to be our best evaluation of the cross section for F−. The cusp on the curve at the
single-photon threshold is a Wigner threshold eﬀect. It is a consequence of the abrupt

The only other work that used an asymptotically correct 2p wavefunction was the
model potential calculation of Robinson and Geltman (1967), which produced a cross
section two times greater than those of Crance, Pan et al and van der Hart. The results
of Robinson and Geltman (full squares in ﬁgure 1) are much closer to our results in
comparison with all others.

Thus, we see that in multiphoton processes the error introduced by using a bound-

state wavefunction with an incorrect asymptotic behaviour could be much greater then
the eﬀects of electron correlations. Of course, the diﬀerence between the experimental
and HF energies is also a manifestation of electron correlation eﬀects. It inﬂuences the
result via the asymptotic behaviour of the ground-state wavefunction, and we see that
this is the most important correlation eﬀect in multiphoton detachment. The use of
the asymptotically correct 2p wavefunction changes the cross section by a factor of two
and more, which is much greater than other correlation eﬀects (Pan et al 1990). This
fact distinguishes this problem from the single-photon processes, where other correlation
eﬀects are essential.

The angular asymmetry parameters β2 and β4 calculated using the Dyson 2p-state
wavefunction are shown in ﬁgure 2. They reveal an interesting dependence on the
photon energy with sign changes and cusps at the single-photon detachment threshold.
Figure 2 also presents the experimental points of Blondel and Delsart (1993) obtained
at ω = 0.171 Ryd, and the correlated dipole length results of Pan and Starace (1991)
at the same energy. The asymmetry parameters (7) are relative quantities, and the
results of diﬀerent calculations are much closer for them than for the absolute values of
the photodetachment cross sections. Thus, our present results are practically equal to
those obtained in the model 2p wavefunction calculation (Gribakin et al 1998). There
we also showed that the results from the analytical adiabatic theory (Gribakin and
Kuchiev 1997b) are in good agreement with the numerical results from other approaches,
including the plane-wave approximation, especially in β4. It appears that this parameter
is on the whole less sensitive to the details of the calculation, because it is simply
proportional to the amplitude of f wave emission, and there are no interference terms
in expression (7) for β4. The experimental values of β2,4 for F− obtained in the earlier
work of Blondel et al (1992) are close to those of Blondel and Delsart (1993). This is
why F− serves as a good benchmark for angular asymmetry calculations. Figure 2 shows
that our present calculations with the Dyson 2p wavefunction is in good agreement with
experiment.

3.2. Chlorine

The HF calculations of the Cl− ground state gives EHF
0.301 Ryd for the 3p-
electron energy, while the experimental value derived from the electron aﬃnity of Cl is
0.2657 Ryd (Hotop and Lineberger 1985). The spin-orbit splitting in Cl− is
Eexp
still small, since the energies of the 3p3/2 and 3p1/2 states diﬀer by less than 0.008 Ryd
(Radtsig and Smirnov 1986), and we ignore it here.

3p =

3p =

When ΣE includes the monopole and dipole terms, equation (8) yields the 3p binding
energy of 0.22 Ryd. To obtain the 3p wavefunction with the experimental 3p energy we
solve equation (8) using ΣE with the scaling factor η = 0.842, introduced as outlined in

10

Sec. 2.2. The corresponding asymptotic parameters are listed in Table 1.

The two-photon detachment cross sections we have obtained for the negative chlorine
ion are plotted in ﬁgure 3 together with the results of other calculations (Robinson and
Geltman 1967, Crance 1987b, Jiang and Starace 1988, van der Hart 1996). Note that
our HF cross section is signiﬁcantly higher than the results obtained by Jiang and
Starace (1988) and van der Hart (1996) (dotted and dotted-dashed lines in ﬁgure 3,
respectively), but agree better with the HF cross section calculated by Crance (1987)
(open circles) and less than the cross sections obtained within plane-wave approximation
(Crance 1987, Sturrus et al 1992).

The total detachment cross section calculated with the Dyson 3p wavefunction is
30% higher at the maximum than the HF one, but above the single-electron threshold
it agrees quite well with the HF results. The maximal value of the cross section is closer
to the model calculations by Robinson and Geltman (1967) (full squares in ﬁgure 3),
who used an asymptotically correct wavefunction from a model-potential calculation.
However, the latter calculation reveals a rapid decrease of the cross section beyond the
maximum. The experimental result obtained by Trainham et al (1987) at ω = 0.142
Ryd is also shown.

The angular distribution parameters are shown in ﬁgure 4. In general the parameters
β2 and β4 behave similarly to those in the negative ﬂuorine, going through sign changes
and cusps at the single-electron threshold. Also presented are the experimental data and
the results of two calculations done within the plane-wave approximation and with the
ﬁrst Born correction at ω = 0.171 Ryd (Blondel et al 1992). The ﬁrst Born results are
closer to our calculations with the correct (Dyson) ground-state wavefunction, where the
interaction between the photoelectron and the atomic residue is included in all orders
through the HF wavefunctions of the photoelectron. Comparison with the experimental
data of Blondel et al (1992) looks inconclusive. In the subsequent measurement Blondel
and Delsart (1993) conﬁrmed the accuracy of the original data for F−, but found that
the β values for I− in Blondel et al 1992 where aﬀected by a spurious background. It
appears that in the case of heavier halogens, for the data obviously are not as reliable
as in the ﬂuorine case (Blondel 1997).

3.3. Bromine

The binding energy of the 4p state in Br− obtained HF approximation is equal to 0.2787
Ryd, which is less than those for F− and Cl−. On the other hand, the spin-orbit splitting
of the 4p orbital for Br−, 0.034 Ryd (Radtsig and Smirnov 1986), is four times greater
than that in the negative chlorine ion. Besides this, the experimental data on the two-
photon detachment from Br− (Blondel et al 1992) were obtained separately for the
two ﬁnal ﬁne-structure states of the atom, 4p3/2 and 4p1/2. Therefore, we use diﬀerent

ground state wavefunctions for the 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 states.

0.281 Ryd

To obtain the 4p3/2 radial wavefunction we solve equation (8) with η = 0.865 in ΣE,
0.247 Ryd, equal to the experimental energy of the
and obtain the eigenvalue E4p =
4p3/2 state (Hotop and Lineberger 1985). The experimental energy of the 4p1/2 state,
is very close to the HF 4p energy, and we simply use the corresponding
−
HF wavefunction for the 4p1/2 orbital. The two wavefunctions thus obtained have the
following asymptotic parameters: A = 1.53 and κ = 0.497 au for 4p3/2, and A = 1.60
and κ = 0.530 au for 4p1/2. The wavefunctions of the intermediate and ﬁnal states are
calculated in the frozen HF ﬁeld of neutral atom residue, and we use the same sets to
calculate the two-photon amplitudes (3) and (4) for both 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 states. After
the electron detachment from these states the neutral Br is left in either of the two ﬁne-
structure states 2P3/2 or 2P1/2. The corresponding total and diﬀerential cross sections
are evaluated from the equations, which account for the number of electrons in the j = 3

where σ and dσ/dΩ are deﬁned by equations (2) and (6), and l = 1 for the halogen ions.
The results of cross section and angular distribution parameter calculations are

presented in ﬁgures 5 and 6.

The partial 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 detachment cross sections have similar shapes with the
cusps shifted by the spin-orbit splitting energy. We would like to emphasize that the
ratio of the maxima of these partial cross sections is not equal to the statistical 2 : 1. The
reason is that because of the diﬀerent binding energies the 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 wavefunctions
have diﬀerent asymptotic behaviour. As we discussed above, this diﬀerence is enhanced
in multiphoton processes, which clearly favour the more loosely bound state.

We have not found any experimental values of the two-photon detachment cross
section in Br−, so in ﬁgure 5 we compare our results with the calculations of Robinson
and Geltman (1967) and Crance (1988). In the calculation of Robinson and Geltman
the ﬁne-structure splitting of was not taken into account. This means that they used
the same wavefunction and energy for both sublevels (basically, a 4p3/2 one, since it
corresponds to the experimental electron aﬃnity). On the other hand,
in the HF
calculation the wave function is practically identical to that of the stronger bound 4p1/2
orbital. This is why our total cross section, obtained as a sum σ(3/2)+σ(1/2), goes between

It is equal to the negative of the sum of the electron aﬃnity and the ﬁne-structure splitting of the

4p subshell in Br.

the Robinson and Geltman and HF curves. The plane-wave approximation cross section
of Crance (1988) has a much higher maximum than all of the results presented in the
ﬁgure.

As regards the photoelectron angular distribution, the asymmetry parameters for
the 4p3/2 and 4p1/2 sublevels have similar dependences on the photon energy (see
ﬁgure 6). They also follow the general trends observed for F− and Cl−. The
experimental data points of Blondel et al (1992) obtained at ω = 0.171 Ryd agree
well with our calculations, except for the β4 parameter in the 4p1/2 detachment channel.
Our calculation demonstrates better agreement with experiment than the plane-wave
approximation, or that which includes the ﬁrst Born correction (Blondel et al 1992).

0.2248 Ryd and

The two-photon detachment calculation for I− are performed in the same way as for
Br−. The experimental energies of the 5p3/2 and 5p1/2 ﬁne-structure sublevels in I−
0.2941 Ryd, respectively (Hotop and Lineberger 1985, Radtsig
are
and Smirnov 1986). The HF approximation yields EHF
0.2583 Ryd. The Dyson
5p =
orbital of the 5p3/2 state is obtained using the coeﬃcient η = 0.823.
in ΣE. It yields
the experimental 5p3/2 state energy, and the wavefunction with asymptotic parameters
1.808 and κ = 0.474 au. The same calculations with η = 0.008 reproduces
A =
2.587 and
the experimental 5p1/2 energy, and produces a wavefunction with A =
κ = 0.542 au. Using these ground-state wavefunctions together with the HF sets of the
intermediate and ﬁnal state HF wavefunctions we calculate the two-photon detachment
amplitudes (3) and (4) for the 5p3/2 and 5p1/2 electrons, and obtain the total and
diﬀerential cross sections (10) and (11).

The cross sections are shown in ﬁgure 7. Due to a larger diﬀerence in the binding
energies the eﬀect of non-statistical ratio between the maxima of the σ(3/2) and σ(1/2)
cross sections is even more noticeable here than in Br. In I− their ratio in the region
below the single-photon threshold is about 3 : 1 instead of the statistical 2 : 1. The
HF threshold is located between the two ﬁne-structure thresholds. Nevertheless, the
sum σ(3/2) + σ(1/2) would rise above the HF curve. On the other hand, it would be
close but still lower than the model-potential results of Robinson and Geltman (1967).
The plane-wave calculations (Crance 1988) give an even higher cross section at the
maximum.

The angular distribution parameters are presented in ﬁgure 8. For the 5p3/2 electron
detachment from I− there are two measuments at the photon energy of 0.171 Ryd
(Blondel et al 1992, Blondel and Delsart 1993), and the more recent one shows a much
better agreement with our calculations. If we speculate that the earlier measurement
for the 5p1/2 ﬁne-structure component was aﬀected by the spurious background in a way

13

similar to that seen in the 5p3/2 data, larger absolute values of β2,4 could be expected
for the 5p1/2 detachment measurements. This will bring them in better agreement with
our calculated values (ﬁgure 8 b). As for the β parameters calculated in the plane-
wave approach and with the ﬁrst Born correction, they show large scatter, similar to
that seen in Cl and Br.
It means that the potential between the photoelectron and
the atom should be included non-perturbatively, at least at the HF level, as in the
present calculation. Of course, for a more accurate description one will have to include
correlation eﬀects, e.g., the electron-atom polarization potential.

4. Concluding remarks

In the present paper we have performed direct numerical calculations of the two-photon
detachment from the halogen negative ions. We paid special attention to the proper
its correct asymptotic
description of the initial ground state wavefunction, namely,
behaviour. The outer np ground-state orbitals of the negative ions were calculated from
the many-body theory Dyson equation with the non-local correlation potential adjusted
to reproduce experimental binding energies. We have conﬁrmed the understanding based
on the adiabatic theory (Gribakin and Kuchiev 1997a, 1997b, Gribakin et al 1998) that
using asymptotically correct initial state wavefunctions is especially important for the
absolute values of the multiphoton detachment cross sections.

3/2 and P 2

For heavier halogen negative ions (Br and I) our calculations reveal substantial non-
statistical branching of photodetachment into the P 2
1/2 ﬁnal atomic states. This
eﬀect is mainly a consequence of the diﬀerent asymptotic behaviour of the corresponding
outer negative ion orbitals np3/2 and np1/2. Our calculations also predict the existence
of prominent cusps in the two-photon detachment cross sections and angular asymmetry
parameters at the single-photon detachment thresholds. Our cross sections are in
general closer to those obtained by Robinson and Geltman (1967), who worked within a
model-potential approach and used asymptotically correct bound-state wavefunctions.
Our calculations of the photoelectron angular asymmetry parameters give best overall
agreement with the measurements of Blondel et al (1992) and Blondel and Delsart
(1993) at the photon energy of 0.171 Ryd.

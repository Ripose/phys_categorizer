(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We have measured the lifetime of the 5s5p 3P2 metastable state of strontium atoms by magneto-
optically trapping the decayed atoms to the ground state, which allowed sensitive detection of the
rare decay events. We found that the blackbody radiation-induced decay was the dominant decay
channel for the state at T = 300 K. The lifetime was determined to be 500+280
−130 s in the limit of zero
temperature.

PACS numbers: 32.70.Cs, 32.80.Pj

Precision measurements require the isolation of the
physical system under study from environmental pertur-
bations. The long coherence time thus obtained can be
exploited to carry out ultra-high resolution spectroscopy
[1] or to create and control the macroscopic quantum co-
herence in atomic systems, such as Bose-Einstein Con-
densate (BEC) [2] and Cooper pairing [3]. Further-
more, the origin of environmental decoherence has re-
cently attracted much attention in the context of quan-
tum computation/communication,
in which an entan-
gled quantum system should maintain its internal and/or
motional state coherence [4, 5]. The lower-lying 3P
metastable states [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] of alkaline earth
species are intriguing candidates for these studies. A long
metastable lifetime may allow an optical spectroscopy at
[13], enabling one to realize an ultra-
the 1 mHz level
precise atomic clock.
In addition, the possibilities of
evaporatively cooling them to reach BEC are discussed
theoretically [14, 15].

Laser-cooled and trapped atoms in ultra-high vac-
uum condition oﬀer an ideal sample for these stud-
ies, as the collisional interactions with container walls
or residual gases can be substantially removed. How-
ever, in some cases, the radiation from the surrounding
walls dramatically aﬀects the evolution of the internal
state coherences.The room-temperature blackbody radi-
ation (BBR) has its intensity peak around a wavelength
of 10 µm. Such BBR manifests itself most in Rydberg
states [16, 17, 18], where infrared transitions with large
electric dipole moments can be found. However, be-
cause of large energy diﬀerences, it hardly excites atoms
in the lower-lying states.
Its inﬂuence, therefore, has
been rarely discussed in laser cooling and trapping. On
the other hand, it is known that the BBR causes small
but non-negligible ac Stark shifts in ultra-precise spec-
troscopy [19, 20].

As for the 3P metastable state of heavier alkaline-earth
atoms, the upper-lying 3D states are connected to the
metastable state by electric dipole transitions with mid-
infrared wavelength. Therefore, the excitation of the
metastable state by the BBR may signiﬁcantly alter its
eﬀective lifetime or introduce detectable blackbody shifts
in precision spectroscopy. In this Letter, we study the in-
ﬂuence of the room-temperature BBR on the metastable
state lifetime of Sr, which is recently predicted to be

FIG. 1: The relevant energy levels for 88Sr. The 1S0 − 1P1
transition at λ = 461 nm is used for trapping and detection.
The leak path through the 1D2 state is used for loading atoms
into the 3P2 metastable state. The 3P2 → 3S1 transition at
λ = 707 nm and the 3P0 → 3S1 transition at λ = 679 nm are
used to transfer the 3P2 state population into the ground state.
The upper-lying 3D states are connected to the 3P states by
the electric dipole transitions at λ ≈ 3 µm.

1050 s [23]. Because the lifetime is signiﬁcantly longer
than the collision-limited lifetime of tens of seconds that
is realized in neutral atom traps at a vacuum pressure
of 10−10 torr [24], observing the survival of metastable
atoms in such traps will not be practical [24, 25]. Instead
of directly observing the decay of the metastable atoms
by emitted photons [26], we monitored the occurrence of
the rare decay events to the ground state by magneto-
optically trapping the atoms on the 1S0 − 1P1 transition.
In this way, we used the magneto-optical trap (MOT) as
a photon ampliﬁer with a gain of 1010 to detect the decay
events with unit quantum eﬃciency [27, 28].

Figure 1 shows the relevant energy levels for 88Sr.
Three radiative decay channels from the metastable
5s5p 3P2 state have been identiﬁed by Derevianko [23]:
1) The M2 transition to the ground state, 2) Decay to
the 3P1 state through the M1, E2, and M3 transition, 3)

Decay to the 3P0 state through the E2 transition, where
En or Mn stands for an electric or a magnetic 2n-pole
transition. The theory suggests that the contribution of
the channel 3) is only 0.1% [23]. Therefore, 99.9% of
the population in the 3P2 state ﬁnally relaxes to the 1S0
ground state, as the atoms that decayed to the 3P1 state
further decay to the 1S0 ground state in 22 µs. On this
basis, we use the 1S0 state population to detect the decay
of the 3P2 state.

We measured the number of atoms NS(t) in the 1S0
ground state by applying the MOT on the 1S0 − 1P1 tran-
sition. The change of the atom number in the MOT is
given by the rate equation,

d
dt

NS(t) = − (γp + Γc) NS(t) + (γr + Γq) NP (t).

(1)

The atoms in the ground state are collisionally lost at
a rate Γc ≈ (10 s)−1 or leaked out of the MOT tran-
sition via the 5s4d 1D2 state with the typical rate of
γp ≈ (20 ms)−1. The atoms are supplied by the 3P2
metastable state with its atom number of NP (t), which
either radiatively decay (γr) or collisionally quench (Γq)
to the ground state, where Γq ≪ γr holds as discussed
Ignoring both of the collisional loss terms of Γc
later.
and Γq, the steady-state solution of Eq. (1) for t ≫ γ−1
is given by,

γr =

γp,

NP

(2)

where we assumed NP (t) to be constant as the decay of
the population in the 3P2 state with the collisional decay
rate of Γm ≈ (10 s)−1 is small enough in the time scale
of interest. The metastable decay rate γr, therefore, can
be determined by the ratio NS/NP of population dis-
tributed in both of the states and the MOT decay rate
γp. The number of atoms in the 1S0 ground state can
be derived by observing the MOT ﬂuorescence intensity
of IS = ηNS, where η is the photon counting rate per
atom trapped in the MOT. Similarly, NP can be obtained
by transferring the metastable state population into the
ground state and measuring the MOT ﬂuorescence in-
tensity of IP = ηNP . By the ratio of these ﬂuorescence
intensities, γr/γp(= IS/IP ) is accurately determined re-
gardless of the coeﬃcient η.

The apparatus for magneto-optically trapping stron-
tium atoms is similar to that described in Ref. [29]. The
MOT ﬂuorescence was collected by a lens with a solid
angle of 10−5 and then sent to a photomultiplier tube
(PMT). An interference ﬁlter was placed in front of the
PMT to block except the 461 nm light. The output sig-
nal was then sent to a multi-channel scaler. The two
transitions, 3P2 → 3S1 and 3P0 → 3S1 (Fig. 1), were used
to pump the 3P2 metastable state population into the 1S0
ground state.

We ﬁrst loaded the MOT from an atomic beam on the
1S0 − 1P1 transition for 0.3 s.
In the mean time, the
3P2 metastable state was populated via the weak branch-
ing decay to the 1D2 state from the 1P1 state, which is

FIG. 2: The photon counting signal. The signal at 0 < t < 1 s
indicates the photons scattered by the recaptured atoms in the
ground state. At t = 1 s, the 3P2 metastable state population
is pumped into the ground state. The peak intensity gives the
number of atoms in the metastable state. The decaying slope
gives the MOT lifetime, which is γ−1

intensity reaches its maximum in ≈ 5 ms.

estimated to be 10−5 [30]. About 107 atoms in the low-
ﬁeld-seeking state were thus accumulated in the mag-
netic trap, which is formed by the quadrupole magnetic
ﬁeld used for the MOT. The ﬁeld gradient was 100 G/cm
along its axis of symmetry. At the typical peak density
of ≈ 109 cm−3, two-body collisional loss rate is estimated
to be much smaller than the collisional loss term Γc in
Eq. (1), where we assumed an inelastic collisional loss
rate of ≈ 10−11 cm3/s [14, 15]. We then turned oﬀ the
MOT lasers and closed the shutter that blocked both the
atomic beam and the thermal radiation from the oven.
We waited for 0.3 s so that all atoms except magnetically
trapped metastable atoms diﬀused out of the trap region.
After that, we turned on the MOT lasers again to cap-
ture atoms that were radiatively decayed from the 3P2
state and recorded the ﬂuorescence intensity. At t = 1 s,
we irradiated both of the pumping lasers to transfer the
metastable state population into the 1S0 ground state and
determined the number of atoms trapped in the 3P2 state
by the MOT ﬂuorescence intensity.

Figure 2 shows a change of ﬂuorescence intensity aver-
aged over 102 measurements, where the background level
was subtracted by alternating the same procedure with
and without loading atoms into the magnetic trap. The
number of atoms in the 1S0 state at t = 1 s was de-
termined by exponentially extrapolate the whole decay
curve IS(t) of the MOT ﬂuorescence to obtain IS(1) with
better statistics. The ﬂuorescence decay in 0 < t < 1 s
was mainly caused by the collisional atom loss in the mag-
netic trap with the decay rate Γm = (6.6 s)−1 at the back-
ground gas pressure of 6.6 × 10−10 torr. By transferring
the metastable state population into the ground state at
t = 1 s, the ﬂuorescence intensity sharply rose up to its

maximum in about 5 ms. We approximated IP (1) by the
peak ﬂuorescence intensity shown in the inset of Fig. 2.
The signal then decayed double-exponentially, consisting
of the MOT decay with γp = (14.1 ms)−1 due to the
branching loss and the much slower collisional decay Γm
of the metastable atoms recaptured in the magnetic trap.
The metastable state lifetime is calculated by applying
the ratio NS/NP = IS(1)/IP (1) and the measured MOT
decay rate γp in Eq. (2). The measurement shown in
Fig. 2 gave an eﬀective radiative lifetime of γ−1
r = 104+8
−7
s, which is only one tenth of the theoretical lifetime [23].
This shortening can be attributed to the BBR-induced
decay via the 5s4d 3D state as discussed later. However,
before discussing the BBR-induced decay, we checked the
other decay channels.

The reduction of the lifetime may be caused by the ﬁne
structure mixing of the metastable 3P2 state with the 3P1
or the 1P1 state in the presence of the trapping magnetic
ﬁeld. Assuming a magnetic ﬁeld of 10 G, the magnet-
ically induced decay rates are estimated to be 0.1% of
the natural decay rate γ0 of the 3P2 state. Actually, we
measured the metastable lifetime under various magnetic
ﬁeld gradient, however, the change of the lifetime was
within the statistical errors of 5 % as expected. Second,
due to collisions with background gases, atoms in the
metastable state may be 1) kicked out of the magnetic
trap with the rate Γm or 2) quenched into the ground
state with Γq. For the former issue, since we compared
the ﬂuorescence intensity IS and IP just before and af-
ter the population transfer, the collisional atom loss in
the transferring period of τp = 5 ms may cause an er-
ror. However its fraction is estimated to be as small
as 1 − e−Γmτp ≈ 10−3. For the latter issue, the colli-
sional quench to the ground state may cause pressure-
dependent shortening of the metastable state lifetime.
To check this inﬂuence, we increased the background gas
pressure up to 1.6 × 10−9 torr and measured the lifetime.
However, the change in the decay rate was well within
statistical uncertainties.

The rapid decay can be attributed to the metastable
state quenching due to the BBR ﬁeld that transfers atom
population in the 3P2 state to the short-lived 3P1 state via
the 3D states. By solving the coupled rate equations, the
steady-state value of the BBR-induced decay rate γB(T )
is expressed as,

γB(T ) = γD

¯n(T ),

where γD is the radiative decay rate of the 5s4d 3D state,
and ¯n(T ) = {exp(hc/kBT λ) − 1}−1 is the BBR pho-
ton occupation number at temperature T with the wave-
length λ ≈ 3.01 µm for the 3P2 − 3D transition. Using

D = 2.9 ± 0.2 µs of the 3D states
the radiative lifetime γ
[31], the BBR-induced decay rate is calculated to be
γB(T0) = 8.03×10−3 s−1 for T0 = 299.5 K. Therefore the
intrinsic decay rate γ0 of the 3P2 state at T → 0 K is de-
termined as γ0 = γr(T0)−γB(T0) = (2.3±0.7)×10−3 s−1,
which corresponds to a lifetime of 440+200
−100 s. To conﬁrm

and the calculated line indicates the natural decay rate γ0.

that this lifetime shortening originates in the BBR exci-
tation, we measured the decay rate γr(T ) as a function
of the ambient temperature T by heating up the vac-
uum chamber that enclosed the MOT. We note that this
temperature change altered the vacuum pressure in the
range of (6.6 − 9.7) × 10−10 torr. However, the resultant
collisional losses did not aﬀect the measured lifetime as
mentioned previously. The measured decay rate γr(T ) is
plotted in Fig. 3 by ﬁlled squares, where error bars indi-
cate one standard deviation. The monotonic increase of
the decay rate as the temperature clearly supports that
this lifetime shortening is caused by the BBR.

The BBR-induced decay rate is estimated as follows.
Initially, the chamber that surrounds the atoms is as-
sumed to be in thermal equilibrium. However, in heating
up the chamber, care should be taken if it is in thermal
equilibrium. The vacuum chamber is made of stainless
steel with 150 mm diameter and has six viewing ports
made of BK7 glass with 40 mm diameter. It was heated
by a ribbon heater wound around the chamber body. We
monitored the temperature of the viewing ports (at their
rim and center) and the body of the chamber one hour
after changing the heating power: Whereas the tempera-
ture of the rim was the same as that of the chamber body
T , that of the center was somewhat lower by δT (> 0).
Assuming the linear change of the temperature between
the rim and the center, the average temperature for the
viewing ports was approximated as Tp = T − δT /3. Ow-
ing to this temperature inhomogeneity, atoms are not in
the BBR ﬁeld of thermal equilibrium. Assuming a spher-
ical radiant cavity, the eﬀective photon occupation num-
ber for the body temperature of T is calculated as [32],

¯neﬀ (T ) =

Ωbεb¯n(T ) + Ωpεp ¯n(Tp)
Ωbεb + Ωpεp

.

(4)

(cid:13)
Here Ωb is the solid angle covered by the chamber body
and εb is its spectral emissivity at λ ≈ 3 µm. Like-
wise we deﬁned Ωp and εp for the viewing ports, which
fraction in the solid angle was Ωp/Ωb ≈ 10−1. We used
this eﬀective photon occupation number ¯neﬀ (T ) to cal-
culate the BBR-induced decay rate given by Eq. (3). We
took the spectral emissivity of both objects as ﬁtting pa-
rameters so that the measured decay rate γr(T ) should
have a constant oﬀset γ0 to the calculated BBR-induced
decay rate γB(T ) at each temperature. After the least
squares ﬁtting, we obtain the metastable decay rate of
γ0 = (2.1 ± 0.4) × 10−3 s−1 and the spectral emissivities
of εb = 1.6% and εp = 88% for stainless steel and BK7
glass, respectively. The obtained emissivity for BK7 glass
showed fair agreement with ε = 96% derived from the in-
dex of refraction n = 1.48 for BK7 glass at λ ≈ 3 µm.
Reference data for polished stainless steel, however, was
not available.

In the above discussion, we have not included the un-
certainty of the 3D state radiative lifetime, which gives
coupling strength between the 3P and 3D states and
thus signiﬁcantly aﬀects the BBR-induced decay rate. In
Ref. [31], the observed radiative lifetime of the 3D state
is given as τD = 2.9 ± 0.2 µs. This uncertainty brings an-

4

other statistical error of ±0.6×10−3 s−1 to the metastable
decay rate. Thus, we ﬁnally obtain the metastable de-
cay rate γ0 = (2.0 ± 0.7) × 10−3 s−1, or the metastable
lifetime of 500+280

−130 s.

In summary, we have determined the lifetime of the
5s5p 3P2 state of 88Sr to be 500+280
−130 s in the limit of zero
temperature. Because the room-temperature BBR con-
siderably shortens the metastable lifetime, care should
be taken when dealing with the state to form a BEC
[14, 15] or any other applications that require long co-
herence time. We, therefore, need to prepare cold envi-
ronment to suppress thermal photons. For example, by
just lowering the ambient temperature down to 275 K,
the BBR-induced decay rate becomes comparable to its
intrinsic decay rate. A straightforward comparison of the
measured lifetime with the theory will be possible by fur-
ther lowering the temperature down to 217 K, where the
BBR quenching rate is expected to be 1% of the natural
decay rate.

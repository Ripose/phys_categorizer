Narrow s-wave features with subthermal widths are predicted for the 1Πg photoassociation spectra
of cold alkaline earth atoms. The phenomenon is explained by numerical and analytical calculations.
These show that only a small subthermal range of collision energies near threshold contributes to
the s-wave features that are excited when the atoms are very far apart. The resonances survive
thermal averaging, and may be detectable for Ca cooled near the Doppler cooling temperature of
the 41P←41S laser cooling transition.

I. INTRODUCTION

II. THEORY OF SUBTHERMAL LINE SHAPES

Photoassociation spectroscopy has become a very pow-
erful tool for studying the collision physics of laser cooled
and trapped atoms [1]. The conventional wisdom is that
the linewidth of individual molecular levels in the pho-
toassociation spectra of laser cooled atoms is due to the
natural linewidth plus thermal broadening on the order
kBT , where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the
temperature. Thus, we would not expect photoassocia-
tion lines to be much smaller than kBT in width [2–7].
However, we demonstrate subthermal linewidths for a
special case of photoassociation at very long range to
an excited vibrational level v with a small natural decay
width Γv. In this case the s-wave vibrational features are

much higher T (e.g.,

to the thermally averaged photoassociation spectrum.

Narrow features are possible in 1Πg photoassociation
trap loss spectra at small detuning of alkaline earth atoms
in a magneto-optic trap (MOT) [8]. For Ca there is a
good chance that the sharp s-wave features will stand
out on a background comprised of broader peaks from
the higher partial waves of the 1Πg spectrum and the
broad features of the 1Σu spectrum, even around the
Doppler cooling temperature TD (TD = 0.83 mK for
the Ca 41P
41S cooling transition). Photoassociation
spectroscopy in a Ca MOT has been reported [9], but in
that experiment the photoassociating laser was detuned
far from atomic resonance (about 780 atomic linewidths
Γat), whereas our features are predicted for small detun-
ings (< 25 Γat).

A. Trap loss spectrum

In Ref. [8] we outlined the numerical and analytical
models used here. The numerical photoassociation trap
loss spectrum is obtained from a fully quantum mechan-
ical three-channel model, where the time-independent
Schr¨odinger equation is solved with a complex potential
to represent spontaneous decay from the excited state.
We repeat only the essential analytical formulas here,
and concentrate on the explanation of the phenomenon.
For a more detailed description of diﬀerent aspects of
cold photoassociation collisions of alkaline earth atoms,
see Ref. [8].

Figure 1 shows a high resolution scan of our calculated
state change (SC) trap loss spectra of cold Ca atoms at
three diﬀerent temperatures for a single vibrational level
of the 1Πg state. There are a number of 1Πg isolated vi-
brational resonance features in the range of detuning ∆
from 1 to 25 Γat to the red of atomic resonance. Our ex-
ample is typical of these features. Note that the features
labeled A and B in the ﬁgure are both narrower than
kBTD. Although the transition between the 1Σg ground
state and the 1Πg excited state is forbidden at short and
intermediate internuclear distances R, it becomes allowed
at long range due to relativistic retardation eﬀects [8,10].
The trap loss collision of the two cold atoms proceeds
via excitation at a long range Condon point RC to the
1Πg state (the diﬀerence of ground and excited molecu-
lar potential energy curves equals the photon energy at
RC ). Once in the 1Πg state the atoms are accelerated
towards short range. The survival probability in moving
from long to short range on the 1Πg state is close to unity
due to the small decay rate (Γ(R)
0). At
short range a SC may occur due to spin-orbit coupling

to a lower lying state correlating to atomic 1S + 1D, 3D
or 3P states. After SC to these channels, modeled here
by a single eﬀective channel, the atoms will be lost from
the trap due to the large gain in kinetic energy.

The photoassociation spectrum in Fig. 1 is the ther-

mally averaged loss rate coeﬃcient [11]:

where x = ε/(kBT ). As we show below, a consequence
of the excitation at a very large RC is that only a small
range of energies, much less than kBT when T is near TD,
contributes to the thermal average integral in Eq. (2),
especially for s-waves. Consequently, averaging does not
introduce much additional broadening.

B. Analytic theory

An analytic interpretation can be given for the ori-
gin of the subthermal linewidths. When the spacing hνv
between vibrational levels v is much larger than their

where the peak appears depends on the model potentials in
Ref. [8]. It may appear at a diﬀerent ∆/Γat in an actual ex-
periment. The smooth background of about 2 units due to the
1Σg → 1Σu transition [8] is not shown. The Doppler cooling
temperature for cooling on the 41P atomic state is 830 µK,
and the recoil temperature is 2.7 µK. The low temperature
limit for the feature labeled A is a Lorentzian line centered at
the resonance position ∆/Γat = 11.37 with a natural width of
1.2 MHz. The peak of the A feature, which clearly has a sub-
thermal width for T = 830 µK, is normalized to unity for the

FIG. 2. Thermally averaged Ca SC trap loss rate for T =
0.83 mK and I = 1 mW/cm2 from the analytic line shape
model, Eqs. (3), (5) and (6), compared to the full quantum
numerical result, including contributions from ℓ ≤ 6. The
separate contributions are shown for the s-, d-, and g-waves,
with the dominant contribution to each peak labeled by ℓJ.

Figure 2 shows the thermally averaged Ca trap loss
spectrum K(T, ∆) at TD = 0.83 mK obtained by insert-
ing Eq. (3) into Eq. (1) using Eq. (5) or (6). The analytic
model takes a few input parameters from the numerical
model [8]: the scattering length for the ground state po-
tential (the actual value is unknown, but the model value
is 67 a0), Γvp/h
0.3 MHz < Γv,rad/h = 0.8 MHz, and
the position εv(J)+sv(J) of the vibrational levels for each
J. The good agreement with the quantum numerical cal-
culations indicates the quality of the analytic model.

≈

Figure 2 also shows the individual contributions from
the s-, d-, and g-waves (ℓ = 0, 2, 4). The analytic for-
mulas also compare very well with the details of these
individual features in the numerical calculation (compar-
ison not shown). We will concentrate on the overall sub-
thermal features labeled A and B. The A feature is a
sharp s1 line sitting on a background due to d and g
lines, whereas the B feature takes its relative sharpness
from a d3 line sitting on the d2 and g4 background. The
d2 feature contributes the shoulder on the left of the A
peak.

C. Origin of subthermal features

model for the ℓJ = s1, d2, and d3 features in Fig. 2.

The variation of the integrand K(ε, ∆, ℓJ) in Eq. (2) as
a function of ε and ∆ provides an explanation for the
subthermal features. Since K(ε, ∆, ℓJ) peaks in a small
kBTD , only a small range of collision en-

0.1 mK for the s-wave and 0.2 mK for

the d-wave, contributes to the width of the feature (for
comparison, Γv,rad/kB = 0.04 mK). Consequently, the
s-wave peak A broadens only slightly when the temper-
ature increases from T = 0.083 mK to the Doppler limit
TD = 0.83 mK, as seen in Fig. 1. Even the d-wave fea-
ture B remains subthermal, although broader than the
s-wave feature.

The dotted contour lines start at 0.000025 and increase in

The variation of K(ε, ∆, ℓJ) is a consequence of the

evident in the upper panel of Fig. 3. Using Eqs. (5) and

and kthRC = z1(ℓ) for ℓ > 0, where the ﬁrst maximum
in jℓ(z) for positive argument is at z = z1(ℓ). Taking RC
= 513 a0 and the arbitrary model value A0 = 67 a0 for
our case gives εth/kB = (¯hkth)2/(2µkB) = 0.05 mK for
the s-wave and 0.18 mK for the d-wave. Thus, the large
RC leads to the small value for kth and εth, and conse-
quently to the subthermal linewidth. For energies higher
than εth, K(ε, ∆, ℓJ) has a node at ε where φg(ε, ℓ, RC)
has a node at RC , e.g., at ε/kB = 0.21 mK for the s-wave
and 0.55 mK for the d-wave. A second maximum in the
ground state wavefunction appears at higher energy, 0.48
mK in the case of the s-wave. This is the origin of the
maximum in the red wing of the s1 feature labeled s1′ in
Figs. 2 and 3.

III. CONCLUSION

We predict that subthermal line shapes should appear
in high resolution photoassociation spectra of the 1Πg
1S laser cooling transi-
state of Ca dimer near the 1P
tion. Such features will be hard to see for Mg, where weak
1Πg lines are obscured by a large 1Σu background [8].
Subthermal lines may be less prominent for Sr or Ba
because of additional predissociation broadening and a
higher density of states that combine to give broader and
more blended 1Πg features.

←

Subthermal linewidth of scattering resonances are pos-
sible when the contributions to the line shape from the
relevant S-matrix elements is restricted to very low col-
lision energies below the range of thermal energies kBT .
In our present study, this is a consequence of the very
large Condon points associated with the transitions. It
would be useful to extend this analysis to other pho-
toassociative transitions or magnetically-induced Fesh-
bach resonances [15]. This would be most interesting in
the case of a large s-wave scattering length, that is, when

Tensorial analysis of the long-range interaction between
metastable alkaline-earth atoms

Robin Santra and Chris H. Greene
JILA, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0440
(Dated: December 26, 2013)

Alkaline-earth atoms in their lowest (nsnp) 3P 2 state are exceptionally long-lived and can be
trapped magnetically. The nonspherical atomic structure leads to anisotropic long-range interac-
tions between two metastable alkaline-earth atoms. The anisotropy aﬀects the rotational motion
of the diatomic system and couples states of diﬀerent rotational quantum numbers. This paper
develops a tensorial decomposition of the most important long-range interaction operators, and a
systematic inclusion of molecular rotations, in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld. This
analysis illuminates the nature of the coupling between the various degrees-of-freedom. The con-
sequences are illustrated by application to a system of practical interest: metastable 88Sr. Using
atomic parameters determined in a nearly-ab initio calculation, we compute adiabatic potential
energy curves. The anisotropic interatomic interaction, in combination with the applied magnetic
ﬁeld, is demonstrated to induce the formation of a long-range molecular potential well. This curve
correlates to two fully polarized, low-ﬁeld seeking atoms in a rotational s-wave state. The coupling
among molecular rotational states controls the existence of the potential well, and its properties
vary as a function of magnetic-ﬁeld strength, thus allowing the scattering length in this state to be
tuned. The scattering length of metastable 88Sr displays a resonance at a ﬁeld of 339 Gauss.

INTRODUCTION

The ability of van der Waals’ equation-of-state of a real gas [1] to describe the phase transition from the gaseous
to the liquid state is one of the manifestations of the universal importance that must be attributed to interatomic
forces. Renewed interest in their detailed understanding has been prompted by the experimental demonstration [2, 3]
of a pure quantum phase transition—Bose-Einstein condensation—in dilute gases of alkali-metal atoms. Ultracold
conditions, which are necessary for the formation of a Bose-Einstein condensate, provide an ideal setting to observe,
and measure precisely, weak interatomic interactions [4].

Alkali atoms constitute a natural choice: They possess strong electric dipole transitions from their ground state
that lie in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This makes them ideal candidates for laser cooling
techniques. Furthermore, as eﬀective one-electron systems they have a magnetic dipole moment and can be trapped
in a suitably shaped magnetic ﬁeld. The experimental interest in alkali atoms triggered precision theoretical studies
devoted to uncovering their long-range interaction properties [5, 6, 7, 8].

Noble-gas atoms become accessible to laser cooling if they are not in their electronic ground state but in an
excited, metastable one. Dispersion coeﬃcients for metastable helium, 2 1S0 and 2 3S1, have been calculated, for
example, by Chen [9] and by Yan and Babb [10]. The metastable states of the heavier noble gases can be written as
3P 2 (n = 2 for neon, and so on). The associated electron distributions are nonspherical, in contrast
np5(n + 1)s
to the 2 1S0 and 2 3S1 states of atomic He—and in contrast to ground-state alkali atoms. The interactions between
(cid:0)
such metastable noble-gas atoms are not isotropic, and they are not pure dispersion forces. (Dispersion coeﬃcients
are reported in Ref. [11].) The most important new interaction is the electric quadrupole-quadrupole interaction, as
discussed by Doery et al. [12]. Under normal conditions, anisotropic interactions between the constituents of a gas
tend to be smeared out due to thermal averaging. Only ultracold temperatures permit their detailed study.

(cid:1)

Recently, alkaline-earth atoms have moved into the focus of interest.

In their ground state they can be laser-
3P 1
cooled using the strong 1S0 →
intercombination transition to achieve laser cooling of ground-state 88Sr down to a few hundred nano-Kelvin [15].
Stable alkaline-earth isotopes with an even number of nucleons predominate, which therefore possess no nuclear
magnetic moment: Their electronic spectra are free of hyperﬁne structure. This simpliﬁes the interpretation of
experimental data and facilitates comparison to theory [16]. The analysis of the photoassociative spectrum of cold
40Ca atoms measured by Zinner et al. may serve as an illustration [17].

1P 1 transition [13, 14]. Katori et al. exploited the extremely narrow 1S0 →

Ground-state alkaline-earth atoms, which have a closed-shell electronic structure, do not lend themselves to pure
magnetic trapping. Switching oﬀ the light ﬁeld employed to hold the laser-cooled atoms in a magneto-optical trap,
followed by evaporative cooling down to quantum degeneracy, is thus not an option. An interesting strategy to
overcome this obstacle is to work with metastable alkaline-earth atoms in their lowest (nsnp) 3P 2 state [18, 19],
which have radiative lifetimes of the order of ten minutes [20]. The experimental feasibility of magnetic trapping of

2

metastable 88Sr has already been demonstrated [21, 22, 23].

Metastable alkaline-earth atoms share with metastable noble-gas atoms (excluding He) the property of interact-
ing through anisotropic forces. However, as was shown quantitatively by Derevianko [20], the dominant electric
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction is noticeably stronger among alkaline-earth atoms: Their large quadrupole mo-
ment is a consequence of the relatively diﬀuse spatial distribution of the excited p-electron; the lack of spherical
symmetry of a metastable noble-gas atom, on the other hand, is due to the hole in the compact valence shell, shielded
by an orbiting electron of s-symmetry. Since metastable alkaline-earth atoms—in contrast to noble-gas atoms—do
not suﬀer from trap losses via the phenomenon of Penning ionization [24], they oﬀer the exciting prospect of quantum
degenerate gases with pronounced anisotropic interatomic interactions.

Derevianko and co-workers recently presented a ﬁrst, simpliﬁed analysis of the ultracold collision properties of
metastable alkaline-earth atoms [25]. They predict the existence of a long-range molecular potential well for the
electronic state of highest Zeeman energy in a given external magnetic ﬁeld. The scattering length on this potential
energy curve can be tuned by adjusting the magnetic-ﬁeld strength, thus enabling control of sign and strength of
the eﬀective interatomic interaction at ultracold temperatures. The numerical results in Ref. [25] are based on the
assumption that s-wave scattering of two metastable alkaline-earth atoms in the low-ﬁeld seeking state mentioned
above is sensitive only to the rotationally invariant part of the interatomic interaction potential. However, as we shall
show in this paper, that approximation is not justiﬁed in the case of relatively strong anisotropic coupling and does
not lead to quantitatively accurate predictions.

In order to provide a systematic framework for describing anisotropic interactions, we present in Sec. II a detailed
tensorial analysis of the leading interatomic interaction operators. In particular, we show that the electric quadrupole-
quadrupole operator transforms like a spherical tensor of rank four, and we decompose the electric dipole-dipole
dispersion operator into tensors of rank zero, two, and four. Similar tensorial ideas have been applied, for instance,
to the anisotropic interactions between molecules [26, 27, 28] and these were crucial to formally demonstrate the
surprising existence of a vector interaction—a tensorial coupling of rank one—between a high-angular momentum
Rydberg electron and an anisotropic ionic core [29, 30]. General introductions to the techniques of spherical tensor
algebra may be found in Refs. [31], [32], and [33].

An important new ingredient, facilitated by our use of tensorial methods, is the inclusion of the quantum-mechanical
rotation of an anisotropically interacting diatomic system in a magnetic ﬁeld (Sec. III). At interatomic distances of a
few hundred Bohr radii, electronic interaction energies and rotational energies are comparable. Anisotropic interatomic
interaction leads to coupling between diﬀerent rotational quantum states, and the classiﬁcation of a diatomic eigenstate
using just a single rotational quantum number ceases to be meaningful.

Section IV is devoted to the discussion of a concrete example: metastable 88Sr. We have calculated all relevant
long-range parameters (magnetic dipole moment, electric quadrupole moment, and dispersion coeﬃcients), treating
the correlation between the two valence electrons in atomic 88Sr fully. Using these parameters, which are in generally
good agreement with the ones presented in Ref. [25], we obtain adiabatic potential curves by diagonalizing the
complete diatomic Hamiltonian as a function of interatomic separation. Our calculations reproduce the phenomenon
of a potential well in the low-ﬁeld seeking state, correlating at large interatomic separations to a rotational s-wave
state and fully polarized atoms with highest Zeeman energy. We make use of perturbation theory to shed light on
how the interplay of the diﬀerent physical operators generates the long-range molecular potential well. Our analysis
clariﬁes how the magnetic-ﬁeld strength aﬀects depth and location of the potential minimum. It also shows that, at
interatomic distances in the vicinity of and below the potential well minimum, the eigenstate acquires an appreciable
admixture of higher rotational quantum states. Indeed, for this reason the scattering lengths we ﬁnd on the basis of
our numerical data diﬀer substantially from those reported by Derevianko et al. [25].

A concluding discussion is given in Sec. V. We use atomic units throughout, unless otherwise noted.

II. TENSORIAL STRUCTURE OF INTERATOMIC INTERACTION OPERATORS

A. Leading expansion terms and Feshbach formalism

The interaction Hamiltonian, Hint, of two atoms whose electron clouds do not overlap can be expanded in terms
of inverse powers of the interatomic distance, R, by applying techniques well known from classical electrodynamics
[34, 35, 36, 37]. All operators in the resulting series can be expressed using purely atomic observables.

Given a neutral atomic species with nonvanishing magnetic-dipole and electric-quadrupole moments, the leading

expansion contributions up to ﬁfth order in 1/R can be written as

Hint = Hdd + Hmm + Hdq + Hqq,

(1)

where

Hdd =

is the familiar electric dipole-dipole interaction operator. xi1 symbolizes the position of an electron belonging to atom
1 relative to the nucleus of that atom. Similarly, xi2 refers to an electron in atom 2, measured in relation to the
nucleus of atom 2. n denotes a unit vector along the diatomic axis. Using spherical multipole moment operators,

The basic assumption underlying this representation of Hdd is that the vector n introduced in Eq. (2) is identical to
ez, the Cartesian unit vector along the z-axis of a chosen reference frame. Hence, Eq. (5), and all other equations in
the remainder of this section, refer to a body-ﬁxed frame. We will return to this point later when we incorporate the
eﬀect of molecular rotation.

The second term on the right-hand side of Eq. (1) describes the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction [38] between

atom 1 and atom 2:

(µB: Bohr magneton; j(k): total angular momentum of atom k; s(k): spin of atom k), is a spherical tensor of rank one.
Since we restrict our treatment of magnetic eﬀects to the dipole term, we suppress the rank index of µ(k). In fact, at
interatomic distances of only a few hundred Bohr radii or less, even magnetic dipole-dipole coupling is negligible. We
include it here because it becomes the dominant interaction beyond a distance of a thousand atomic units, as we will
show in Sec. IV.

The expansion term in fourth order contributing to Hint is the electric dipole-quadrupole operator,

and ﬁnally, in 1/R5, we have electric quadrupole-quadrupole coupling:

Electric dipole-octupole interactions, which are also proportional to 1/R5, are neglected.

Our focus in this work is on heavy alkaline-earth atoms, in which relativistic eﬀects are signiﬁcant even in the
valence shell. We will assume that the splitting between neighboring atomic energy levels corresponding to the same
ﬁne-structure manifold be larger than the interatomic interaction energy. Let both atoms be in the same well-deﬁned

into account all other electronic degrees-of-freedom, apart from the projection quantum number m of the total atomic
angular momentum. Without interatomic coupling, direct products of the form

span an energetically degenerate, (2j + 1)2-dimensional subspace of the full electronic Hilbert space of the diatomic
system. This uncoupled basis of the degenerate model space formed the starting point of the approach taken by other
authors [11, 20, 25]. However, in order to make most eﬃcient use of the powerful techniques of tensor algebra and
also to demonstrate and exploit inherent symmetries of the problem, we prefer to work in a coupled representation:

By representing Hint in the (2j + 1)2-dimensional model space and diagonalizing the resulting matrix, approximate

interaction energies can be obtained. Note that

because all atomic eigenstates comprising the model space have the same parity and, therefore, are not coupled
by the electric dipole operator. The two atoms experience no direct electric dipole-dipole and no direct electric
dipole-quadrupole interactions.

However, another important ingredient is still missing: the electric dipole-dipole dispersion interaction, which is a
consequence of coupling to electronic states outside the model space. This can be included by deﬁning complementary
projection operators

B. Coupled representation of interatomic interaction operators

Next we address the transformation properties of HI under simultaneous rotations of atom 1 and atom 2. Since
excited alkaline-earth atoms are, in general, nonspherical, it is natural to ask how the interatomic interaction reﬂects
this lack of isotropy. To that end we seek a compact tensorial formulation of Hmm, Hqq, and Hdis, by coupling the
respective atomic tensor operators to diatomic ones. This approach also has the advantage that it enables a very
systematic and elegant evaluation of matrix elements of HI with respect to the coupled basis introduced in Eq. (10).
−m of atomic tensor operators can be

We ﬁrst turn our attention to Hmm, Eq. (6). Each direct product µ(1)

Eq. (6), it is easily seen that

which demonstrates the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction operator is the 0-component of a second-rank tensor. A
similar argument can be applied to show that Hqq (Eq. (9)) is the 0-component of a fourth-rank tensor:

For the purpose of uncovering the tensorial structure of the dispersion interaction operator, Hdis (Eq. (20)), we
draw on considerations used by Fano and Macek in their study of the angular distribution and polarization of the light
emitted by atoms excited in collision processes [42]. Greene and Zare exploited those ideas to describe the anisotropic
emission of photofragments [43] and of laser-induced ﬂuorescence [44].

In analogy to Eq. (23), the electric dipole-dipole interaction operator in Eq. (20) is

III. MOLECULAR ROTATIONS IN EXTERNAL MAGNETIC FIELD

A.

Invariant formulation of interatomic interaction Hamiltonian

Suppose each of the two atoms were in a spherically symmetric electronic state (j = 0, m = 0), deﬁned with
respect to a quantization axis held ﬁxed in the laboratory frame. In this case, the interatomic interaction energy
clearly does not depend on the orientation of the diatomic axis relative to the quantization axis. If, however, the
atoms are nonspherical (j > 0), then the anisotropic forces, as expressed through the tensorial structure of the eﬀective
interaction operator HI in Eq. (33), attempt to align the atomic angular momenta along the diatomic axis. The relative
orientation of diatomic axis and laboratory-ﬁxed quantization axis now matters. This leads to a coupling between
electronic degrees-of-freedom and molecular rotations. In order to put this intuitive picture into more quantitative
terms, we need a formulation of HI that makes use only of observables speciﬁc to the laboratory frame.

Let U be a rotation operator from the laboratory z-axis to the body-ﬁxed z-axis. This operator connects each

tensor TK,0 in Eq. (33) with the 0-component of the tensor TK measured in the laboratory frame:

On the other hand, the operator U T (Lab)

K,0 U −1 is just a linear combination of tensor components T (Lab)

K,M , M =

K, ..., +K. The expansion coeﬃcients are the elements of the appropriate rotation matrix:

T (Lab)
K,0

:= U −1TK,0U.

TK,0 =

(K)

M,0(ϕ, ϑ, 0)T (Lab)
K,M .

D

XM

Here, ϑ and ϕ are the polar and the azimuthal angle, respectively, of the diatomic axis in the laboratory frame. Since
for integer K

−
(see, for example, Ref. [39]), the expansion coeﬃcients in Eq. (52) can also be interpreted as the components of a
spherical tensor of rank K, deﬁned with respect to rotations generated by L, the angular momentum operator of the
diatomic axis. Thus,

D

(K)
M,0(ϕ, ϑ, 0) = (

1)M CK,−M (ϑ, ϕ)

which demonstrates TK,0 is a tensor of rank zero with respect to rotations generated by the total angular momentum
Jtot = L + J. Under rotations of all particles—electrons and nuclei—HI is therefore totally invariant:

TK,0 = √2K + 1 [CK ⊗

B. Zeeman operator and rotation energy

Precise experimental studies of long-range interactions can be carried out with cold, magnetic atoms trapped by
means of suitable magnetic ﬁeld conﬁgurations [51]. The presence of an externally applied magnetic ﬁeld B breaks
the local rotational invariance, and Jtot is no longer expected to be a good quantum number. To model this situation,
we make the simplifying assumption that B is homogeneous: B =
ez. The complete Hamiltonian describing the
relative motion of two interacting atoms, with reduced mass mred, exposed to a magnetic ﬁeld is thus

Atomic strontium can be regarded as a two-electron system, at least on the excitation energy scale of just a few
electron volts relevant to the present study. This realization can be exploited to eﬃciently compute and successfully
reproduce the amazing complexity of photoabsorption Rydberg spectra of alkaline-earth atoms. A detailed and general
description of the underlying concepts, formal developments, and applications is given in Ref. [53].

This one-electron potential is physically well motivated: At large distances from the ionic core, the electron feels the
attraction by a practically pointlike Sr++ ion. As the electron comes closer, the ionic core responds to the presence
of the electron and becomes polarized. αcp = 7.5 a.u. is the dipole polarizability of Sr++ [54]. Below the empirical
cutoﬀ radius rl, there is a transition, mediated by the term proportional to αl,2, from the exterior to the interior
region of the ionic core. The electron interacts with an unscreened nucleus of charge Z = 38 at r much smaller than
1/αl,1. Note that the parameters αl,i and rl are assumed to be dependent on the orbital angular momentum quantum
number l of the valence electron. They are determined by comparing the theoretical excitation spetrum computed on
the basis of Eq. (64) with experimental data on Sr+; the values used in this work were taken from Ref. [53].

Another important interaction operator must be included for a quantitative description of heavy alkaline-earth

The quantum-mechanical motion of an electron exposed to the potential

is solved using a ﬁnite-element
basis [57, 58, 59] for the radial degree-of-freedom. A radial box size of 25 Bohr radii and 600 ﬁnite-element functions,
corresponding to a quadratically spaced grid of 200 sectors inside the box and three functions in each sector, have
proved to be suﬃcient. The Sr+ model Hamiltonian h, which comprises kinetic energy and eﬀective potential, is
represented and diagonalized in a product basis of ﬁnite-element and spin-angular [48] functions up to l = 6 (i-orbitals).
For each combination of orbital and total angular momentum quantum numbers of the single valence electron, the 18
energetically lowest radial eigenfunctions—excluding of course the ﬁlled inner-shell states—are selected. A two-electron
basis set is then constructed by coupling pairs of the selected eigenstates of the one-electron Hamiltonian h, performing
the angular momentum algebra within the jj-coupling scheme. Denoting the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion as
1/r12, the eigenenergies and eigenstates of the valence shell of atomic strontium are obtained by diagonalizing the
matrix representation of h(1) + h(2) + 1/r12 in the two-electron basis set. In this way the complicated dynamics of
the two correlated valence electrons is treated to a high degree of accuracy.

V

The direct numerical evaluation of Eqs. (39), (41), and (45) using the two-electron eigenvectors is straightforward.
Our results for the atomic parameters, which are converged with respect to all basis set parameters described above,
are shown in Table I, together with the ab initio data presented by Derevianko et al.
[25]. The magnetic dipole
moment of metastable 88Sr was not explicitly discussed in Ref. [25]. In a 3P 2 state it seems natural to assume an
atomic spin of 1, consistent with a magnetic dipole moment of
3. However, due to spin-orbit interaction the total
spin is not really a good quantum number, and it had to be checked that the degree of spin symmetry violation is
negligible. This is, in fact, the case. Our calculated electric quadrupole moment agrees well with that of Ref. [25];
the intermediate dispersion coeﬃcients also agree, to within the 10% one-standard deviation uncertainty of the data
quoted by Derevianko and co-workers [25].

B. Diatomic potential energy curves and scattering lengths

Before we turn our attention to quantitative results on the interaction energies between metastable Sr atoms, it is
helpful to explore the relative importance of the diﬀerent interaction operators we have analyzed in Secs. II and III.
To that end we have collected in Table II simple order-of-magnitude estimates as a function of interatomic separation.
They are easily obtained by using the parameters in Table I and diagonalizing the individual terms the interatomic
interaction operator, HI (Eq. (33)), consists of, represented in the coupled basis of the electronic model space, Eq. (10).

FIG. 1: Adiabatic potential energy curves of two metastable strontium atoms ((5s5p) 3P 2) in a magnetic ﬁeld of 100 G,
obtained by diagonalizing the matrix V deﬁned in Eq. (66). The total angular momentum projection quantum number, Mtot,
is +4. The marked curve correlates at large interatomic separations to two fully polarized strontium atoms (atomic projection
quantum number m = +2) in a rotational s-wave state (L = 0). A basis describing molecular rotations in the laboratory frame
with elements up to L = 40 has been employed in the calculation.

Table II allows us to draw several important conclusions. Between distances of 100 and 1000 Bohr radii the electric
quadrupole-quadrupole interaction dominates. Only as R = 10 is approached, the electric dipole-dipole dispersion
interaction becomes comparable. However, at these relatively small distances the interaction energies are comparable
with the ﬁne-structure splitting between the (5s5p) 3P 2 and the (5s5p) 3P 1 state, which is of order 10−3 Hartree.
In other words, at distances much lower than 100 Bohr radii the electronic model space we have chosen in Sec. II is
no longer appropriate. Truncating all interaction operators of orders higher than six in 1/R (Eq. (19)) also becomes
highly questionable under these circumstances. At R
100 a.u., however, the formalism developed in this paper may
be expected to be useful for quantitative predictions.

≥

In the long-range limit, at R larger than 1000 Bohr radii, magnetic dipole-dipole coupling remains the only relevant
interatomic interaction mechanism. Also shown in Table II are the characteristic energy quanta associated with
the rotational motion of the diatomic system. They are comparable with dispersion energies around distances of
R = 100, but become dominant at interatomic separations of 1000 Bohr radii and more. As is well known, at
ultracold temperatures only rotational s-waves remain unaﬀected by the long-range rotational barrier and can probe
interatomic interaction properties. In the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld, another energy scale must be taken
into consideration: the Zeeman splitting, which is of order 10−7 Hartree for a magnetic ﬁeld strength of 100 Gauss.
Hence, typical laboratory ﬁelds are unable to distort the spin-orbit coupling pattern in 88Sr, and our assumption of
uncoupled ﬁne-structure states remains valid.

Figures 1, 2, and 3 display adiabatic potential energy curves of two metastable strontium atoms exposed to a

magnetic ﬁeld of 100 G. The curves were calculated by diagonalizing, as a function of R, the matrix

i.e., the sum of the matrices of the rotational kinetic energy operator (Eq. (61)), the interatomic interaction operator
(Eqs. (57) and (58)), and the Zeeman operator (Eq. (63)). Exploiting the symmetry properties of V , we selected a
basis characterized by even rotational and even electronic angular momentum quantum numbers. In our numerical
studies we included rotational quantum numbers up to Lmax = 40, which gave converged results.

Of immediate interest for magnetic trap experiments are low-ﬁeld seeking atomic states. For j = 2 these are the
ones with projection quantum numbers m = +1 and +2.
If both atoms are fully polarized (m = +2) and in a
rotational s-wave state (this is associated with a molecular eigenstate only at large interatomic separations), then
the total angular momentum projection quantum number, Mtot, is +4. Mtot is conserved at all stages of a collision
between the two atoms. The energetically highest Zeeman manifold with Mtot = +4 is depicted in Fig. 1. The
potential energy curve correlating to the rotational s-wave is indicated in the ﬁgure. The behavior of the s-wave
energy diﬀers signiﬁcantly from that of the curves deriving from higher rotational states, which are clearly repulsive.
The s-wave curve is attractive at distances larger than 150 Bohr radii and becomes repulsive at smaller radii. Near
the minimum of the resulting potential well there are several avoided crossings, which lead to inelastic losses through

FIG. 2: Adiabatic potential energy curves of two metastable strontium atoms ((5s5p) 3P 2) in a magnetic ﬁeld of 100 G. In this
case Mtot = +3. The energy region shown corresponds to the Zeeman manifold deriving from the situation that one atom is in
an m = +2 state and the second one in an m = +1 state. The atomic projection quantum numbers lose their validity below
distances of a few hundred Bohr radii, where atom-atom interactions become important.

nonadiabatic transitions to lower lying Zeeman states. Because of the steepness of the diabatically crossing channels,
however, we do not expect severe losses and neglect them in this paper.

If one of the colliding atoms has m = +2 and the other one m = +1 at large distances, then Mtot = +3 assuming
L = 0. The ﬁnal combination of two low-ﬁeld seeking atoms—m = +1 for both atoms—corresponds to Mtot = +2,
again implying an s-wave collision. The two cases, Mtot = +3 and Mtot = +2, are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively.
The most dramatic diﬀerence between the cases Mtot = +4 (Fig. 1) and Mtot = +3 (Fig. 2) is the strength of the
attractive potential an s-wave experiences: For Mtot = +3, this is stronger by about one order of magnitude. In this
Zeeman manifold the couplings are so strong that even a state correlating to a higher partial wave is subject to strong
attractive forces. In Fig. 3, Mtot = +2, the potential energy curves are even more complicated and suggest interesting
cold-collision dynamics. There is a double degeneracy in this energy region at large interatomic separations, since
two atoms with m = +1 have the same energy as one atom with m = +2 plus a second atom with m = 0. The latter
atom cannot be magnetically trapped.

In the following we are going to concentrate on the long-range potential well in the energetically highest Zeeman
manifold with Mtot = +4 (Fig. 1). Molecular rotations are found to play a key role in its origin. We have calculated
adiabatic potential energy curves for three diﬀerent rotational basis set sizes and extracted those curves that correlate
to two fully polarized strontium atoms in a rotational s-wave state. The results are shown in Fig. 4. If in addition
to s-waves only d-waves are included—Lmax = 2—the potential energy curve is purely attractive (the same holds
true if a pure s-wave basis is used). Only as soon as g-waves are taken into account (Lmax = 4) is there an eﬀective
repulsion below R = 150, thus leading to the emergence of a potential well minimum at large R. Nevertheless, the
structure of the curve is still not converged. The potential energy curve obtained using Lmax = 8 illustrates the need
for i- and k-waves. Larger rotational basis sets make it diﬃcult to isolate a smooth potential energy curve due to
the appearance of pronounced avoided crossings (see Fig. 1). However, the structure of the eﬀective diabatic curve
correlating at large distances to an s-wave is essentially the one found for Lmax = 8.

Deeper insight into the formation of the long-range potential well and the role played by molecular rotations can
be gained by resorting to a perturbative approach. For that purpose we take the diagonal of the matrix V deﬁned
in Eq. (66) to represent the unperturbed problem; the perturbation is given by the oﬀ-diagonal elements. At large
interatomic separations the state vector of two fully polarized metastable strontium atoms in a rotational s-wave state
reads

energy. In ﬁrst order, the s-wave experiences pure attraction by scalar dispersion forces. As a consequence of strong
quadrupole-quadrupole coupling to g-waves associated with energetically lower Zeeman manifolds, a steep repulsive
potential wall appears. This requires that coupling is introduced at least to second order in perturbation theory.

The tunability of the molecular potential well could prove useful for controlling the properties of metastable, mag-
netically trapped 88Sr. The most important quantity in this context is the scattering length a [48], which characterizes
the eﬀective interaction between ultracold collision partners [60]. A positive a describes eﬀective repulsion; negative
a implies attraction. The strength of the interaction is governed by

that led to Fig. 4, the maximum L that gave a smooth potential energy curve compatible with the respective result
for Lmax = 40, but which no longer exhibits pronounced avoided crossings. We then numerically integrated the one-
dimensional Schr¨odinger equation with the selected potential energy curve and for asymptotically vanishing kinetic
energy from Rmin = 40 to Rmax = 1940 a.u. The scattering length was obtained from the logarithmic derivative of
the computed wavefunction at R = Rmax. We veriﬁed that our results are converged with respect to variations of the
integration limits Rmin and Rmax.

We have restricted the lowest magnetic-ﬁeld strength in Fig. 8 to

starts to disappear. At
= 0, the long-range potential is purely attractive, and additional knowledge about the short-
range part of the potential would be necessary in order to make quantitative predictions. The strongest ﬁeld we have
considered is
= 500 G. The left classical turning point at this ﬁeld strength is already down to about R = 80. Still
higher ﬁeld strengths would again maneuver us into a regime where our theory probably becomes unreliable (see the
discussion at the beginning of this subsection). However, between 10 and 500 Gauss—and within the approximation
of pure elastic scattering—our scattering lengths may be regarded as accurate to within about 10%.

V. CONCLUSION

Potential wells associated with ordinary molecular bonds are typically a few electron volts, or 104 Kelvin, deep;
the minimum of the potential energy is found at interatomic distances of the order of one Bohr radius. Electronic
interactions at such short distances are so strong that the energy separation between the ground and excited electronic
states dissociating to the same atomic conﬁguration is very large in comparison to rotational energies. In a simpliﬁed
picture we might envisage the strong chemical bond as forcing the atoms into a ﬁxed orientation with respect to the
interatomic axis. Molecular rotation leaves this rigid arrangement virtually unaﬀected.

In fact, however, the long-range physics of metastable alkaline-earth atoms is fundamentally diﬀerent from that
simplistic picture. If the atoms are separated by a suﬃciently large distance, they have constant angular momenta.
As the atoms approach one another, they experience anisotropic forces that modify the molecular rotational motion
as well as the relative orientation of the nonspherical atoms. At interatomic distances of a few hundred Bohr radii, the
energy scales of interatomic interactions and molecular rotations are comparable, and the coupling between atomic
and molecular angular momentum turns out to be rather eﬃcient.

The tensorial analysis presented in this paper puts the coupling mechanism into a particularly clear and useful form.
Our formulation makes maximum use of symmetries, which allows a compact matrix representation of the long-range
Hamiltonian. It will enable systematic multichannel scattering calculations needed to investigate the role played by
inelastic collision processes.

In this study we have numerically diagonalized the Hamiltonian matrix for two metastable strontium atoms and
obtained adiabatic potential energy curves, the adiabaticity referring only to the distance coordinate R. The curves
are in general very complicated. We have therefore focussed on one curve—associated with an s-wave channel and with

the atoms in an experimentally attractive low-ﬁeld seeking state—that exhibits a novel type of long-range potential
well. This well arises from a fascinating interplay between the pure 1/R6-attraction in the s-wave channel and the
strong quadrupole-quadrupole coupling to rotational g-waves attached to lower lying Zeeman manifolds. Recently,
Avdeenkov and Bohn discovered that the anisotropic forces between polar OH molecules in an electrostatic ﬁeld lead
to a similar phenomenon [62].

The scattering length in the long-range potential well in metastable strontium can be tuned by varying the external
magnetic-ﬁeld strength. We ﬁnd a resonance at 339 G, which diﬀers quantitatively from the prediction by Derevianko
et al. [25], who estimate the resonance location to lie near 1000 G. We believe that the present calculations should
improve upon the accuracy of the more approximate treatment of Ref. [25].

Finally, the nature of the resonance deserves attention. It indicates the emergence of the ﬁrst vibrational bound
state as the long-range potential well undergoes a controlled deformation. This process must be contrasted with the
physics underlying Feshbach resonances [63, 64, 65, 66], where the scattering wave in the entrance channel is brought
into resonance with a vibrational bound state in a potential well correlating to an energetically higher channel. The
potential energy curves themselves do not change their qualitative appearance. The strong anisotropic interactions
in cold gases of metastable alkaline-earth atoms open an entirely new route to shaping potential energy curves and
creating temporary molecules with bond lengths of the order of a hundred Bohr radii.

FIG. 8: Scattering length, a, in the long-range potential well calculated as a function of the magnetic-ﬁeld strength, B. The
dots represent numerical data obtained by direct integration of the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation. The solid line is
based on the analytic formula in Eq. (71) (B0 = 173 G and a

(B0) = −0.98/G).

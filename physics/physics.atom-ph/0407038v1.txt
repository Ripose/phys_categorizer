We discuss the possibility of trapping polar molecules in the standing-wave electromagnetic ﬁeld of
a microwave resonant cavity. Such a trap has several novel features that make it very attractive for
the development of ultracold molecule sources. Using commonly available technologies, microwave
traps can be built with large depth (up to several Kelvin) and acceptance volume (up to several
cm3), suitable for eﬃcient loading with currently available sources of cold polar molecules. Unlike
most previous traps for molecules, this technology can be used to conﬁne the strong-ﬁeld seeking
absolute ground state of the molecule, in a free-space maximum of the microwave electric ﬁeld.
Such ground state molecules should be immune to inelastic collisional losses. We calculate elastic
collision cross-sections for the trapped molecules, due to the electrical polarization of the molecules
at the trap center, and ﬁnd that they are extraordinarily large. Thus, molecules in a microwave
trap should be very amenable to sympathetic and/or evaporative cooling. The combination of these
properties seems to open a clear path to producing large samples of polar molecules at temperatures
much lower than has been possible previously.

INTRODUCTION

A growing interest has developed in extending the
achievements of atomic cooling and trapping to mole-
cules [1], particularly polar molecules. The extremely
large electric polarizability of such species enables ac-
cess to strikingly new regimes and phenomena. For ex-
ample, polar molecules subjected to strong electric ﬁelds
have large laboratory-frame electric dipole moments, and
thus can interact via the very strong, long-range dipole-
dipole interaction. It has been argued that this can allow
trapped polar molecules to be used as the qubits of a scal-
able quantum computer [2]. In addition, these interac-
tions could make new types of highly-correlated quantum
many-body states accessible, such as BCS-like superﬂuids
[3], supersolid and checkerboard states, two-dimensional
Bose metals [4], or eﬀectively limited-dimensional gases
[5]. Other applications include the possibility to study
ultracold chemical reactions [6], which might be con-
trolled using electric ﬁelds [7]. Finally, the increased
spectroscopic precision associated with long observation
times, combined with the enhanced sensitivity to certain
types of perturbations, could allow the sensitivity of tests
of fundamental symmetries to be increased to unprece-
dented levels [8].

At present, there remains no demonstrated technique
for producing polar molecules with the very low temper-
atures T (T . 1 mK) and high phase space densities
required for most of these applications. Production of
polar molecules at low translational temperatures, based
on assembly from a sample of laser-cooled atoms, has
recently been demonstrated using photoassociation at
T
100 µK [9, 10, 11], and may soon be possible using
Feshbach resonance-driven magneto-association at even
lower temperatures [12]. Unfortunately, such methods
produce molecular samples that, although translation-
ally and rotationally cold, have their population in one

∼

or several highly-excited vibrational states. Methods are
underway to drive part of the molecular ensemble to the
rovibronic ground state, and to distill these ground state
molecules from the sample. Such methods may eventu-
ally yield samples with the desired properties. However,
this assembly method is unlikely to become widely useful
because of its expense, complexity, and applicability to a
very limited range of species.

Other groups have developed methods for direct cool-
ing and/or slowing of molecules [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Sam-
ples of several molecular species have been produced at
100 mK, in all degrees of freedom (translational,
T
vibrational, rotational), and the resulting molecules have
been (or clearly could be) subsequently trapped. These
direct-cooling methods have wide applicability and are
simpler than the assembly approach. However, they re-
quire a new technological step to reach temperatures sub-
stantially lower than T
10 mK. Collisional cooling
of the trapped molecules (sympathetic and/or evapora-
tive) appears to be the only viable technique for breaking
through this temperature barrier.

∼

Unfortunately, it seems that the prospects are either
uncertain, or demonstrably poor, for further collisional
cooling of molecules in most of the traps now employed.
The essential problem is that these traps are based on
static electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds. Since static EM ﬁelds
cannot have a maximum in free space, these traps hold
only weak-ﬁeld seeking molecules, which are by neces-
sity in an internally excited state. Thus, in such traps
there is always a channel for inelastic collisions, which
can lead to loss of trapped molecules. The rotational de-
gree of freedom of molecules can greatly enhance such
inelastic loss mechanisms, relative to atoms; thus several
authors have expressed pessimism about the prospects
for collisional cooling of molecules in electrostatic traps
[18, 19, 20] as well as magnetostatic traps [21]. While
there may be certain situations where the problems with

collisional cooling in static traps can be avoided [22], it
seems unlikely that such traps could be used very gener-
ally for this purpose.

There have been two types of traps for strong-ﬁeld
seeking (ground state) molecules discussed previously in
the literature. In the ﬁrst of these, a centrifugal barrier
associated with the molecules’ orbital angular momen-
tum around the trap center (e.g., around a charged wire
[23], or in a storage ring [24]) prevents the molecules from
colliding with the electrodes where the strongest electric
ﬁelds exist. Such traps are obviously not suitable for col-
lisional cooling to very low temperatures. A more promis-
ing trap has recently been demonstrated, based on low
frequency modulation of a static trap. The principle of
such traps is similar to that of the Paul trap for charged
particles [25]. However, with realistic technical parame-
ters, such traps for strong-ﬁeld seekers are typically both
shallow (with trap depth D . 10 mK) and small (with
volume V . 10−3 cm3). These constraints will make it
diﬃcult to load large samples of polar molecules into such
”dipole Paul traps”, using currently available sources of
precooled molecules.

In this paper we propose and discuss a new type of
trap, based on the large low-frequency electric polariz-
ability of polar molecules. In particular, we argue that
it is viable to trap and collisionally cool molecules in the
strong, high-frequency electric ﬁeld of a microwave reso-
nant cavity. Such a microwave trap has several notable
advantages over the traps now employed for directly-
cooled molecules, and may be very useful in the eﬀort
to further cool the samples of polar molecules now avail-
able. The advantages of the microwave trap include:

•

•

•

The microwave ﬁeld can trap molecules in their ab-
solute ground state (a strong-ﬁeld seeking state), at
a free-space maximum of the high-frequency elec-
tric ﬁeld. This in turn eliminates all concerns about
two-body inelastic collisions leading to loss of mol-
ecules during evaporative or sympathetic cooling.

With reasonable technical parameters, the micro-
wave trap can have large depth D (D > 1 K) and
volume V (V > 1 cm3), allowing it to be loaded
easily from proven sources of directly-cooled mole-
cules [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Note that optical dipole
traps (which are similar in principle to the micro-
wave trap) can also trap ground-state molecules,
but optical traps are both much shallower and of
much smaller volume than the microwave trap.

An open trap geometry (using a Fabry-Perot mi-
crowave cavity) should allow easy overlap of the
molecules with laser-cooled atoms. The microwave
ﬁeld will also act as a weak trap for the atoms.
Thus sympathetic pre-cooling to temperatures well
below 1 mK seems very promising in the microwave
trap.

•

Strong-ﬁeld seeking states reside in the region of
maximum electric ﬁeld, where they are electrically

2

polarized. The resulting dipole-dipole interaction
results in huge elastic collision cross-sections (σ),
which are desirable for evaporative cooling. This
cross-section actually increases as the temperature
T −1/2) [19]. Thus,
of the molecules decreases (σ
with suﬃciently high initial density, the prospects
seem very favorable for bringing the trapped mole-
cules to a regime of runaway evaporative cooling.

In the following sections we will outline the basic princi-
ple of the microwave trap, in terms of the energy shifts of
molecules subjected to a microwave ﬁeld; discuss realis-
tic design parameters for an implementation of the trap;
and ﬁnally, discuss collisions within the trap.

II. ENERGY LEVEL SHIFTS OF POLAR
MOLECULES IN A MICROWAVE FIELD

ǫeiωt

The basic principle of the microwave trap is to
take advantage of the AC Stark shift associated with
low-frequency transitions arising from rotational (or
inversion-doublet or Lambda/Omega doublet) structure
in polar molecules. For the purposes of this paper, we
conﬁne the discussion to the eﬀect of the microwave elec-
tric ﬁeld on diatomic molecules with simple rigid rotor
in 1Σ electronic states), although the
structure (e.g.,
ideas can be easily extended to molecules with more com-
plex structure. In addition, we consider primarily the ef-
fect on the rotational ground state (J = 0), although such
traps can also be eﬀective for other states under proper
conditions. We assume the molecule is subject to a
harmonically-varying electric ﬁeld E(t) = Re
=
, where ǫ is the complex unit vector indi-
E0Re
cating the polarization. Moreover, we assume that trap
microwave angular frequency ω satisﬁes ~ω . Be, where
Be is the rotational constant.
[Be is deﬁned such that
the ﬁeld-free energy E(J) of the state with rotational
quantum number J is E(J) = BeJ(J + 1).] The re-
sponse of polar molecules to such low-frequency electric
ﬁelds is dominated by the coupling to nearby rotational
levels; as such it is a good approximation to ignore the
vibrational and electronic structure of the molecule. The
Hamiltonian of the system is then H = H0 + H ′, where
H0 = BeJ2, H ′ =
E, µ is the electric dipole mo-
ment in the molecule-ﬁxed frame, and n is the operator
indicating the unit vector along the molecular symmetry
axis. The eigenstates of H0 are deﬁned by the quantum
numbers J and m =

We have performed a general calculation of the AC
Stark shift ∆E of the J = 0 state, which determines
the trap depth. Before describing this general calcula-
tion, however, it is instructive to consider the behavior
of ∆E in some simple limiting cases. For low electric
ﬁeld strength (µ
Be), ∆E can be calculated from
standard time-dependent perturbation theory. To second

we have deﬁned the detuning ∆ of the microwave ﬁeld

J = 1 resonance: ∆
perturbative expression makes clear some of the salient
features of the microwave trap. In particular, it is evident
that for red detuning (∆ < 0), ∆E < 0; thus in this
case J = 0 molecules are attracted to regions of strong
microwave electric ﬁeld. Moreover, ∆E (which will be
the trap depth) can be enhanced by operating at small
detuning.

The microwave trap is clearly similar to the more-
familiar optical dipole trap, which is used commonly
for laser-cooled atoms [27]. For optical traps, it is im-
practical to operate in the regime of small detuning
~
E0, since in this case a high rate of spontaneous
emission from the nearby, short-lived electronically ex-
cited state leads to rapid heating of the sample. The
expression for the depth of an optical dipole trap is thus
typically written in the perturbative limit as above. By
contrast, the spontaneous-emission lifetimes of rotational
states are much longer than typical trap lifetimes; thus
heating by photon scattering cannot be troublesome in
microwave traps. This makes it possible, in principle, to
operate at arbitrarily small detunings, where trap depth
is maximized.

It is also instructive to consider the limit of low fre-
quency, ~ω
Be. Here, for a linearly-polarized ﬁeld
ǫ = ˆz, ∆E must be the same as the DC Stark shift ∆EDC
in an applied DC electric ﬁeld E DC =
ˆz. (The
factor of 1/√2 arises from the fact that the molecule
responds, on average, to the r.m.s. microwave ﬁeld
strength; this is in turn because the Stark eﬀect is
a second-order eﬀect in the low-ﬁeld limit.)

The presence of these avoided crossings makes micro-
wave traps using linearly polarized ﬁelds rather unattrac-
tive. Physically, as a molecule moves from regions of low
to high ﬁeld strength (either spatially or temporally), it
is susceptible to absorption of multiple microwave pho-
tons, resulting in both a signiﬁcant degree of rotational
excitation, and a reduction in eﬀective trap depth rela-
tive to our previous expectations. This situation corre-
sponds to adiabatic following of the energy curve through

ing is probable even for crossings that are too small to

tailed modeling of the molecular trajectories. We note in
passing that this conclusion regarding linearly polarized
ﬁelds may be too pessimistic for molecules with diﬀer-
ent structure, such as an inversion doublet with splitting
much less than the rotational constant (where the mi-
crowave frequency should be detuned to the red of the
doublet transition). However, we have not tried to ana-
lyze such a case explicitly.

III. REALISTIC DESIGN PARAMETERS FOR
A MICROWAVE TRAP

The requirement for a circularly-polarized ﬁeld, along
with a desire to maintain an open geometry for opti-
cal and other access to the trap region, has led us to
consider Fabry-Perot type resonators for the microwave
trap. Such resonators are common in the mm-wave [29]
through optical regions [30], but rather less so in the
microwave regime. Nevertheless, cavities with character-
istics very similar to those required have been demon-
strated [31, 32]; we closely follow the treatment of Ref.
[31] in our discussion here. Our goal is to outline a ba-
sic, realistic design for such a resonator, and discuss the
volume, depth, and other characteristics of the resulting
trap potential.

We consider a symmetric, spherical-mirror Fabry-
Perot cavity. We assume a confocal geometry, where the
mirrors have spacing L and radius of curvature R = L,
and deﬁne the z-axis along the symmetry axis of the res-
onator, with z = 0 midway between the mirrors. We
consider the lowest-order transverse mode (TEM00) in

It is straightforward to show that, for a given micro-
wave power incident on the input mirror of such a cav-
ity, the electric ﬁeld in the cavity is maximized when
t2 = 2γ2; in this case the cavity has loaded Q-factor
Ql = π(q + 1/2)/(2γ2); the unloaded Q-factor, for the
cavity without the input coupling grid, is Q0 = 2Ql. We
assume microwave power Pin is incident on the cavity

We assume a microwave input power Pin = 2 kW. Such
levels of power are commonly available from klystron-
based satellite communication ampliﬁers, throughout
much of the microwave band, i.e., in the frequency range
of roughly 2-18 GHz. (Available power is a factor of 5-10
lower for higher frequencies up to
50 GHz.) These am-
pliﬁers typically deliver the microwave power into stan-
dard waveguide; the required Gaussian mode for input to
the cavity can be eﬀectively obtained by launching into
a corrugated scalar feed horn [35] or, less eﬃciency, with
a standard pyramidal horn. Assuming perfect mode-
matching at the input, we ﬁnd a value for the peak elec-

We have envisaged two possibilities for loading such
a trap. In the simplest scheme, the trap is left oﬀ un-
til a pulse of cold molecules enters the trapping region,
at which time the microwave ﬁeld is rapidly turned on.
Note that the time scale to build up energy in the trap is
τ = Ql/ω; for our nominal parameters, τ = 2 µs. This is
much shorter than the typical time for a cold molecule to
traverse the trapping region, so molecules can be eﬀec-
tively stopped when the trap potential suddenly appears.
This ”trap door” loading scheme requires a source that
delivers pulses of cold molecules already in their strong-
ﬁeld seeking ground state, such as the alternating gra-
dient decelerator [37], or a source of weak-ﬁeld seekers
followed by a coherent pulse of resonant microwaves to
transfer population to the ground state.

−

In the trap door scheme, it is not usually proﬁtable
to load more than a single pulse of molecules into the
trap, since already-trapped molecules can escape while
the trap is turned oﬀ for loading of subsequent pulses.
However, it may be possible to load multiple pulses of
weak-ﬁeld seeking molecules into the microwave trap.
Here, we envision optically pumping the molecules from
the weak-ﬁeld seeking excited state in which they are de-

7

livered, and into the trapped ground state [38]. The dissi-
pation associated with optical pumping, combined with
the rather diﬀerent trap potentials for the strong- and
weak-ﬁeld seekers, makes the loading of one pulse com-
pletely transparent to any existing trapped molecules.
Note that, in the absence of applied ﬁelds, parity selec-
tion rules forbid optical pumping from J = 1 levels to
the J = 0 ground state. However, the presence of the
microwave ﬁeld breaks this selection rule, and makes it
possible to perform the desired pumping. Such a scheme
makes it attractive to load the trap using sources of weak-
ﬁeld seekers, such as the Stark decelerator [39] or the
quadrupole ﬁlter + guide [15]. For our experiments with
SrO, we plan to use a version of the quadrupole guide,
using a buﬀer-gas precooled source of laser-ablated SrO
[40].

IV. COLLISIONS IN THE MICROWAVE TRAP

As noted in the introduction, one of the main advan-
tages of the microwave trap is that it holds molecules
in their absolute ground state, so that two-body inelastic
collisions are impossible. Here we point out that, in addi-
tion, molecules held in a microwave trap may be subject
to very high rates of elastic collisions. This is attractive,
since the re-thermalization associated with elastic colli-
sions is a key step in the process of evaporative and/or
sympathetic cooling.

The primary point of the discussion is that, in the cen-
ter of the microwave trap, the molecules are subject to
the large microwave electric ﬁeld, which results in their
nearly-complete electrical polarization. The r.m.s. ex-
pectation value of the dipole moment of the molecular
state in the presence of the microwave ﬁeld,
, can be
obtained simply from the earlier calculations; it is given
simply by the slope of the ground-state energy vs. elec-
tric ﬁeld curve,
E0.
Under typical conditions, throughout most of the volume
of the trap,
µ/2. The bare dipole-dipole inter-
actions between the polarized molecules are both very
strong and of long range; this in turn greatly enhances
the elastic collision cross-sections, compared to the case
between unpolarized molecules.

Kajita [19, 20], and Bohn [18, 41], have considered elas-
tic collisions between electrically polarized molecules in
a variety of diﬀerent regimes, using rather diﬀerent tech-
niques. We are particularly interested here in collisions
between strongly-polarized molecules at rather high tem-
1 mK, corresponding to the initial con-
peratures (T
ditions in the trap). In this regime, Kajita has argued
that a semi-classical calculation is valid [19]. Although
the discussion of Ref. [19] explicitly focuses on collisions
between weak-ﬁeld seeking states in a static electric trap,
it is straightforward to recast the elastic cross-section de-
rived there in terms of the parameters used in this paper.
Speciﬁcally, using from Ref.
[19] Eqs.(7), (8), and (10),
Table 1, and the discussion following Eq.(10), we ﬁnd

the dipole-dipole elastic collision cross-section σ between
molecules of relative velocity v and mass m can be writ-

The regime in which the result of Eq.(9) is valid ap-
pears to be rather broad. In particular, the semiclassical
treatment (which assumes contributions from many par-
tial waves) should break down signiﬁcantly only when
σ . σq, where σq = 4π(~/mv)2 is the maximum quan-
tum cross-section for a single partial wave. Using the
numerical relation of Eq.(9), we ﬁnd that the condition
σ/σq > 1 for the presumed validity of the semiclassical
calculation implies a very weak condition on the tem-
perature: T > (m[amu])−3
64 µK. Returning
10−14
again to the example of SrO, σ/σq > 1 for T & 3
K! It appears that the semiclassical relation of Eq.(9) is
likely to remain valid under most realistic experimental
conditions. It is notable that the scaling with T appears
to be borne out in the explicit calculations of Ref. [41],
for temperatures down to T

∼
We point out, parenthetically, that the result of Eq.(9)
can be approximately derived using an extremely sim-
ple model. We anticipate that in the semiclassical
limit, the anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interaction will
play a minor role in the average scattering properties.
This leads us to consider the cross-section for scatter-
ing by an isotropic potential of the form Viso(r) =

The Eikonal solution for the anisotropic potential ex-
hibits the same scaling as the proper semiclassical solu-
tion, and is numerically smaller by a factor of only

It is not clear whether this diﬀerence arises principally
because we have neglected the anisotropy of the inter-
action (particularly the repulsive part of the potential),
or because the classical path deviates signiﬁcantly from a
straight line. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd this derivation useful,
for the straightforward way it leads to the correct scaling
(and nearly correct magnitude) of the cross-section.

∼

Finally, we point out the suitability of the micro-
wave trap for performing sympathetic cooling of the
trapped molecules, by contact with much colder laser-
cooled atoms. The geometry of our proposed trap is
very convenient for this purpose. The open distance
between the edges of the mirrors (see Fig. 3) is x =

= 17.9 cm , which is greater

than the mirror diameter (2a = 17.2 cm). Thus, there is
suﬃcient open area to overlap 3 orthogonal laser beams
in the center of the microwave trap, as required for a su-
perposed atomic magneto-optic trap (MOT). In addition,
the microwave ﬁeld itself will form a weak, conservative
trap for the atoms, analogous to that formed by a far
oﬀ-resonant optical dipole trap. The microwave polar-
izability of atoms is virtually identical to the DC polar-
izability; the Stark shift of the atomic ground state in
EDC is typically writ-

Atoms can be loaded into the microwave trap by rapidly
turning on the microwave ﬁeld after the MOT is loaded;
since the volume of the microwave trap is much larger
than a typical MOT dimension, transfer should be very
eﬃcient.

In this context, it is interesting to consider the elas-
tic cross-section between an alkali atom such as Cs,
and a molecule in the trap. This cross-section receives
a contribution from the fact that the alkali atoms are

also slightly polarized in the microwave ﬁeld, with an
rms expectation value of the atomic dipole moment of
iatom = α0E0/√2. Taking into account only the dipole-

dipole interaction between atom and molecule, it is pos-
sible to calculate the cross-section by a simple modiﬁca-
tion of Eq.(9) to take into account scattering by unequal
dipoles. This should represent at least a lower bound on
the atom-molecule elastic cross-section, which could in
principle be signiﬁcantly enhanced by shorter-range ef-
fects (such as the direct interaction of the dipolar ﬁeld
of the molecule with the polarizability of the atom) that
are not considered here. For Cs under our nominal con-

V. CONCLUSIONS

We have argued that microwave-based traps for polar
molecules have many attractive properties. In particular,
using this technology it appears possible to create large,
deep traps for absolute ground state molecules. Collisions
between molecules in these traps should have very large
elastic cross-sections and no two-body inelastic losses,
opening the realistic possibility for evaporative cooling
of molecules. Our discussion has stressed the design of
such a trap for diatomic molecules in rigid rotor states,

using an open trap geometry. With minor modiﬁcations
from our nominal design parameters, this trap would be
well-suited to a wide variety of species; in particular, it
works well for molecules with rotational constants Be in
the range of roughly 0.05 -0.5 cm−1 and intrinsic dipole
moments µ of at least few Debye. This covers many di-
atomics with the lightest constituent atom in the ﬁrst two
complete rows of the periodic table (Li - Cl). Additional
design considerations would be required to optimize the
microwave trap for hydrides, or for molecules with in-
version or lambda-doublet structures; however, we think
it is likely that a similar type of technology could prove
useful in these cases as well.

There also remain a number of interesting questions
In particular,
concerning the operation of such traps.
possible inelastic losses due to three-body processes, par-
ticularly those resulting in chemical reactions, will be
interesting to study in this strongly-interacting system.
In addition, the dynamics of evaporative cooling in such
traps may be very diﬀerent from the well-studied cases
in atomic physics, as the elastic cross-sections become
so large that the dipolar gas has a non-negligible viscos-
ity. We look forward to future studies of such issues. As
mentioned above, we have experiments underway to load
the strongly polar species SrO into such a trap, where we
anticipate many interesting developments.

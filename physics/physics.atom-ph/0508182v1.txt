We discuss the use of high-order quantum accelerator modes to achieve an atom optical realization of a
biased quantum random walk. We ﬁrst discuss how one can create co-existent quantum accelerator modes, and
hence how momentum transfer that depends on the atoms’ internal state can be achieved. When combined with
microwave driving of the transition between the states, a new type of atomic beam splitter results. This permits
the realization of a biased quantum random walk through quantum accelerator modes.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Quantum accelerator modes are characterized by the eﬃ-
cient transfer of large momenta to laser-cooled atoms by re-
peated application of a spatially periodic potential [1, 2, 3].
Quantum accelerator modes therefore constitute a potentially
versatile technique for manipulating the momentum distribu-
tion of cold and ultracold atoms. Following the ﬁrst observa-
tion of quantum accelerator modes [1] there has been substan-
tial progress in developing a theoretical understanding of the
mechanisms and structure that underpin them [4, 5]. This has
permitted the observation and categorization of higher-order
quantum accelerator modes [6], demonstration that the mo-
mentum is transferred coherently [7], observation of the sen-
sitivity of the dynamics to a control parameter [8], and char-
acterization of the mode structure in terms of number theory
[9].

Quantum random walks have received attention due to their
markedly non-classical dynamics and their potential applica-
tion as search algorithms in practical realizations of quantum
information processors [10, 11]. In this paper, we report an
investigation into the use of high-order quantum accelerator
modes to implement a quantum random walk in the momen-
tum space distribution of cold atoms [12]. This method is
more robust and easier compared with other recent propos-
als for implementing quantum random walks using ion traps
[13], microwave or optical cavities [14] and optical lattices
[15], and should make feasible quantum random walks of a
few hundred steps. This would be a useful experimental tool
for information processing.

In this paper we ﬁrst survey the experimental phenomenol-
ogy and theoretical understanding of quantum accelerator
modes. We then discuss how the generation of speciﬁc
quantum accelerator modes can be experimentally controlled.

ington, DC 20036-2103, USA

Based on these techniques, we explain how internal-state-
dependent momentum transfer can be achieved, which will
permit coherent beam-splitting. Finally, we show how this
could be applied to realize experimentally a biased quantum
random walk procedure.

II. OVERVIEW OF QUANTUM ACCELERATOR MODES

A. Observation of atomic quantum accelerator modes

Quantum accelerator modes are observed in the δ-kicked
accelerator system [3]. In the atom optical realization of this
system, a pulsed, vertical standing wave of laser light is ap-
plied to a cloud of laser-cooled atoms [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].
The corresponding Hamiltonian can be written:

ˆp2
2m

ˆH =

+ mgˆz − ~φd[1 + cos(Gˆz)]

δ(t − nT ),

(1)

Xn

where ˆz is the vertical position, ˆp is the momentum, m is the
atomic mass, g is the gravitational acceleration, t the time, T
the kicking pulse period, G = 2π/λspat, where λspat is the spa-
tial period of the potential applied to the atoms, and φd quanti-
ﬁes the kicking strength of laser pulses, i.e. the laser intensity.
This Hamiltonian is identical to that of the δ-kicked rotor, as
studied experimentally by the groups in Austin [16], Auck-
land [17], Lille [18], Otago [19], London [20], and Gaithers-
burg [21], apart from the addition of the linear gravitational
potential mgˆz; this linear potential is critical to the generation
of the quantum accelerator modes.

In the experiments performed to date to observe quantum
accelerator modes, cesium atoms are trapped and cooled in a
magneto-optic trap to a temperature of 5µK. They are then re-
leased from the trap and, while they fall, a series of standing
wave pulses is applied to them. Following the pulse sequence,
the momentum distribution of the atoms is measured by a time
of ﬂight method, in which the absorption of the atoms from a
sheet of on-resonant light through which they fall is measured.

The quantum accelerator modes are characterized by the eﬃ-
cient transfer of momentum, linear with pulse number, to a
signiﬁcant fraction (∼ 20%) of the atomic ensemble.

The spatially periodic potential experienced by the atoms in
the far oﬀ-resonant standing light wave is due to the ac Stark
shift. We can therefore write φd = Ω2
Rtp/8δL [2], where ΩR
is the Rabi frequency at the intensity maxima of the standing
wave, tp is the pulse duration and δL is the red-detuning of the
laser frequency from the 62S 1/2 → 62P1/2, (|F = 4i → |F′ =
3i) D1 transition of cesium. In these experiments, the standing
wave light is produced by a Ti:Sapphire laser; the maximum
intensity of the laser beam is ∼ 1 × 104 mW cm−2. Within
the regime where spontaneous emission can be ignored [2],
the detuning can be modiﬁed over a range of order 30 GHz, so
that the kicking strength can be changed by roughly an order
of magnitude. If δL = 2π × 30 s−1, φd ≃ 0.8π.

Quantum accelerator modes may be observed in δ-kicked
accelerator dynamics when T is close to values at which low-
order quantum resonances occur in the quantum δ-kicked ro-
integer multiples of the half-Talbot time T1/2 =
tor, i.e.
2πm/~G2 (so named because of a similarity of this quantum
resonance phenomenon to the Talbot eﬀect in classical optics).
In the case of the Oxford experiment, T1/2 = 66.7µs [22].

B.

ǫ-classical theory and high-order modes

In 2002 Fishman, Guarneri, and Rebuzzini (FGR) [4] used
an innovative analysis, termed the ǫ-classical expansion, to
explain the occurrence and characteristics of the observed
quantum accelerator modes. This theoretical framework pre-
dicted the existence of higher-order modes, which was subse-
quently veriﬁed experimentally [6]. Our later discussion fo-
cuses on these higher-order modes, so we brieﬂy summarize
the ǫ-classical theory here.

In the δ-kicked rotor, the spatial periodicity of the kicking
potential means that momentum is imparted in integer multi-
ples of ~G. This spatial periodicity also means that the dy-
namics of any initial atomic momentum state are equivalent
to those of a state in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone, 0 ≤ p < ~G, i.e.,
the momentum modulo ~G. This is the quasimomentum, and
hence it is a conserved quantity in the kicking process [23].

The presence of gravitational acceleration in the δ-
kicked accelerator breaks this periodic translational symme-
try. Transforming to a freely-falling frame removes the mgz
term from the Hamiltonian; consequently quasimomentum
conservation is observed, in the freely-falling frame. Conser-
vation of quasimomentum means that diﬀerent quasimomen-
tum subspaces evolve independently. The FGR theory makes
use of this property to decompose the system into an assem-
bly of “β-rotors” [4, 5], where the quasimomentum = β~G and
β ∈ [0, 1).

The linear potential due to gravity makes its presence felt
by changing, relative to the case of the δ-kicked rotor, the
phase accumulated over the free evolution between kicks.
This means that quantum resonance phenomena diﬀerent from
those observed in the δ-kicked rotor occur. For values of T
close to ℓT1/2, where ℓ ∈ Z, certain states permit rephasing,

2

and hence, within any given quasimomentum subspace, the
projection of the initial condition onto states which are appro-
priately localized within (periodic) position and momentum
space are coherently accelerated away from the background
atomic cloud. The momentum of the accelerated population
increases linearly with the number of kicks, and it is this
which constitutes a quantum accelerator mode.

The closeness of the kicking period T to integer multiples
of the half-Talbot time T1/2 is formalized in the FGR theory
by the smallness parameter ǫ = 2π(T/T1/2 − ℓ). In the limit of
ǫ → 0 it is possible to simplify the dynamics of the operator-
valued observables to a set of eﬀective classical (or pseudo-
classical) mapping equations, separate but identical for each
independently evolving quasimomentum subspace, or β-rotor.
If we deﬁne the parameters K = φd|ǫ| and Ω = gGT 2/2π,
these mapping equations can be written:

Jn+1 = Jn − sgn(ǫ)2πΩ − K sin θn,
θn+1 = θn + sgn(ǫ)Jn+1mod(2π),

(2a)
(2b)

where Jn and θn are the transformed momentum and position
variables, respectively, just before the nth kick. A quantum ac-
celerator mode corresponds to a stable island system, centered
on a periodic orbit, in the stroboscopic phase space generated
by the mapping of Eq. (2). As the dynamics of interest take
place within stable islands and are therefore approximately
harmonic, the usefulness of this pseudoclassical picture actu-
ally extends over a broader range of ǫ than might otherwise be
expected [5].

A given island system is speciﬁed by the pair of numbers p,
the order of the ﬁxed point, and j, the jumping index, and the
quantum accelerator mode can be likewise classiﬁed. Physi-
cally, p is the number of pulse periods a “particle” initially on
a periodic orbit takes before cycling back to the initial point
in the reduced phase-space cell, while j is the number of unit
cells of extended phase space traversed by this particle in the
momentum direction per cycle, i.e., Jnp = J0 + 2πnj. Trans-
forming back to the conventional linear momentum in the ac-
celerating frame, after N kicks, the momentum of the acceler-
ated atoms is given by:

pN ≃ 2πN

+ sgn(ǫ)Ω

The ﬁrst quantum accelerator modes to be observed were
those for which p = 1 [1]. Since then, others with orders as
high as 23 have been observed [6]. We shall now focus on
these higher-order modes.

C. Coexistence of quantum accelerator modes

The phase space generated by application of the mappings
of Eq. (2) changes as the parameters K and Ω are varied. In
experiments to date, K and Ω have generally been varied si-
multaneously by scanning T , and hence also ǫ [9]. The struc-
ture of phase space may also be altered by varying φd, and
hence K alone, or by varying g, and hence Ω alone. As the

FIG. 2: (Color online) Variation of the percentage of atoms in the
(5, 2) and (3, 1) quantum accelerator modes as φd changes. The
atomic ensemble is prepared at 5µK, and T = 132.0µs. The (5, 2)
mode (squares) appears with lower kicking strength, and (3, 1) mode
(circles) appears when the kicking strength increases. The error bar
illustrates the typical spread of population in a speciﬁc quantum ac-
celerator mode obtained from the simulation.

atoms evolving under φd = 0.8π undergo a negative momen-
tum transfer, while the atoms experiencing φd = 2.4π undergo
a positive momentum transfer. The phase maps given in Figs.
1(e) and 1(f), along with Eq. (3), show that for the lower kick-
ing strength the quantum accelerator mode is (5, 2), while for
the higher kicking strength the quantum accelerator mode is
(3, 1).

Within a given quasimomentum subspace, the values of J
available for the initial state are equal to (k+β)|ǫ|, where k is an
integer. In the case of a narrow initial momentum distribution,
we expect the value of β, oﬀsetting the available momentum
spectrum, to aﬀect the signiﬁcance of that subspace’s contri-
bution to a physically observable quantum accelerator mode.
Such an eﬀect is clearly of decreasing relevance as ǫ vanishes
[4, 5]. This general observation is borne out by numerical
simulation.

For the case of a thermal atomic cloud, such as the 1 × 107
atoms at 5µK with a Gaussian initial momentum distribution
in which all β are populated more-or-less equally, as used in
our experiments, the dependence of the acceleration on the
kicking strength is shown in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). As expected,
the (5, 2) and (3, 1) quantum accelerator modes, respectively,
are produced. For this system, we can ask at which kicking
strength the diﬀerent quantum accelerator modes appear. The
variation of the population in each quantum accelerator mode
as a function of φd, deduced from the numerical simulations,
is shown in Fig. 2. When the kicking strength is less than 1.2π,
the atoms occupy the (5, 2) mode and the (3, 1) mode is absent.
As one increases the kicking strength, the (5, 2) mode gradu-
ally disappears while the (3, 1) mode comes to dominate; on
further increasing φd, the (5, 2) mode dies completely. There
is a range of φd, centered on the value 1.6π, where the quan-
tum accelerator modes co-exist and atoms can be accelerated
in two diﬀerent modes simultaneously, with diﬀerent direc-
tions of momentum transfer.

erator modes that are produced with g = 9.81 ms−2, T = 132.0µs. In
column 1 (a, c, e), φd = 0.8π and the (5, 2) quantum accelerator mode
is produced; in column 2 (b, d, f), φd = 2.4π and the (3, 1) quantum
accelerator mode results. (a) and (b) show the momentum variation
with the number of kicks for a single initial plane wave with β = 0,

perature 5µK, and (e) and (f) show stroboscopic Poincar´e sections

indicates the population, in arbitrary units.

phase space changes, two or more distinct island chains, spec-
iﬁed by diﬀerent (p, j), can coexist. This means that the corre-
sponding quantum accelerator modes can be simultaneously
produced by kicking the atoms. Hence diﬀerent amounts of
momentum can be transferred to several classes of the atoms
evolving from the initial ensemble. This phenomenon may of-
fer the possibility of building an atomic beam splitter. As we
shall argue below, it may also permit a quantum random walk
to be realized in the atomic sample. We shall now consider
some examples of the eﬀect of altering φd and g.

D. Tuning the kicking strength

We ﬁrst examine the high-order quantum accelerator mode
close to the Talbot time, TT = 133.4µs, for the case of a single
initial quasimomentum state. We take the value β = 0, and
consider the case where T = 132.0µs and the local gravity
value g = 9.81 ms−2. We apply two diﬀerent kicking strengths
to the atoms, φd = 0.8π and 2.4π. The results of our numeri-
cal simulations, shown in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b), demonstrate that

particular quantum accelerator modes. We have also found a
large number of other conditions where atoms are accelerated
in diﬀerent quantum accelerator modes, according to the value
of φd.

III.

INCORPORATION OF ELECTRONIC DEGREES OF

FREEDOM

A. Using an electronic superposition state

Within a given parameter regime, i.e., for particular val-
ues of φd and g, and restricting ourselves to a single plane-
wave as the initial condition, it is not possible to optimally
occupy two quantum accelerator modes for simultaneous ac-
celeration. This can be understood by realizing that coexisting
quantum accelerator modes must necessarily occupy diﬀerent
regions of pseudoclassical phase space.

An eﬃcient way to obtain simultaneous momentum trans-
fer in two directions is to start with a coherent superposition of
internal atomic states so as to optimally change φd separately.
These internal states, produced using a microwave pulse, ex-
perience diﬀerent kicking strengths. This allows us to have
a situation where the same initial motional state experiences
two diﬀerent two diﬀerent kicking strengths, and maximally
occupies two diﬀerent quantum accelerator modes, resulting
in diﬀerent momentum transfers to the two parts of the super-
position.

Considering two general electronic states |ai and |bi, the

desired model Hamiltonian has the form [7]

ˆHab = ˆH(φa

d)|aiha| + ˆH(φb

d)|bihb| +

(|bihb| − |aiha|), (4)

~ωab
2

where ~ωab is the energy gap between |ai and |bi, and ˆH(φa
d)
and ˆH(φb
d) are equal to the atomic center of mass Hamilto-
d and φb
nian of Eq. (1), with φd = φa
d, respectively. In our
experiments, |ai may correspond the |F = 3, mF = 0i substate
of the ground state of cesium, and |bi may correspond to the
|F = 4, mF = 0i substate; henceforth these substates will be
denoted |ai and |bi, respectively.

B. Use of microwave pulses for state preparation

The population of cesium atoms in the states |ai and |bi can
be modiﬁed by a 9.18 GHz microwave pulse, resonant with the
|bi → |ai hyperﬁne transition [7]. The 9.18 GHz diﬀerence
between the transition frequencies from the states |ai and |bi
to any given excited state means that atoms in the two internal
states will experience diﬀerent values of φd when exposed to
laser light of a particular intensity and detuning.

A coherent superposition of |ai and |bi can be achieved ex-
perimentally by applying a π/2 microwave pulse to a sample
of atoms in state |bi, in which they are trapped and cooled.
The intensity and detuning of the light creating the kicking
potential can be selected so as to apply the correct values of
φd to the states |ai and |bi to permit eﬃcient population of

FIG. 3: (Color online) Numerical simulation for the quantum accel-
erator modes that are produced with g = 20.10 ms−2, T = 137.0µs.
In column 1 (a, c, e), φd = 0.8π and the (5, −4) quantum accelerator
mode is produced; in column 2 (b, d, e), φd = 2.4π and the (1, −1) (b,
d, f) quantum accelerator mode results. (a) and (b) show the momen-
tum variation with the number of kicks for a single initial plane wave
with β = 0, (c) and (d) show the evolution of an atomic cloud with
initial temperature 5µK, and (e) and (f) show stroboscopic Poincar´e
sections determined by Eq. (2), with T = 137.0µs (ǫ = 0.336). The
colorbar indicates the population, in arbitrary units.

E. Tuning the eﬀective gravitational acceleration

It is possible to vary the value of the eﬀective gravitational
acceleration applied to the atoms in our experiment, and hence
Ω. This is accomplished by using an electro-optic modula-
tor to vary the phase diﬀerence between the down-going and
retro-reﬂected beams, and hence to move the proﬁle of the
standing wave [3, 8]. This allows us to reach other parameter
combinations that yield simultaneous acceleration in diﬀerent
directions. For example, if we tune the eﬀective gravity to
20.10 ms−2 and choose a kicking period of T = 137.0µs, the
occupied quantum accelerator mode is (5, −4) for the atoms
which experience φd = 0.8π and (1, −1) for those which
evolve under φd = 2.4π. The results of the corresponding
numerical simulations are shown in Fig. 3.

Hence the momentum transferred by each kick can be var-
ied by properly selecting the eﬀective gravitational accelera-
tion, kicking period and kicking strength in order to single out

5

FIG. 4: (Color online)(a) Momentum variation with number of kicks,

applied after the 25th kick. The zoom-in around the switch point is
shown in (b).

the required quantum accelerator modes. For example, with
our current experimental setup, it is feasible to have a value
φd = 0.8π for state |ai, while the corresponding value for
state |bi is φd = 2.4π. Without any alteration to the eﬀective
value of g, atoms in |bi state will be kicked in one direction
[in the (3, 1) quantum accelerator mode] while atoms in |ai
state will be kicked in the other [in the (5, 2) quantum accel-
erator mode], as shown in Fig.1. The transfer of momentum
is therefore dependent on the internal state, which is just what
one needs for a beam splitter. This may well lead to a new type
of interferometry based on this beam splitting mechanism and
will be the subject of future investigations.

C. State-dependent evolution

In this paper, however, we are focusing on the application of
the technique of simultaneous momentum transfer that quan-
tum accelerator modes provide to quantum random walks.
The state-dependence of the momentum transfer permits the
state-dependent evolution required for a quantum, rather than
classical, random walk. With atoms initially in a superposi-
tion of the |ai and |bi states, we can apply kicks to accelerate
the atoms in the two states in diﬀerent directions.

To investigate how the methods of manipulating the internal
state of the atoms permit momentum control, we numerically
simulate a sequence in which we accelerate atoms in state |bi
for 25 kicks with φd = 2.2π, and we then apply a π microwave
pulse to pump all atoms from state |bi into state |ai, for which
φd = 0.7π. T = 132.0µs and g = 9.81 ms−2 are kept constant
during the process. The results of the simulation are shown in
Fig. 4. After the switch, atoms in |bi cease increasing momen-
tum in their original direction and about 30% of them begin to
accumulate momentum in the opposite direction, correspond-
ing to the quantum accelerator mode with the lower kicking
strength. Optimization of the eﬃciency of transfer from one
quantum accelerator mode to the other needs a more detailed
investigation, as we now discuss.

FIG. 5: (Color online) (a) Phase map of quantum accelerator modes,
with β = 0.1, T = 131.0µs, g = 7.26 ms−2, φd = 3.8π for state |ai
(red dots, ) and φd = 0.6π for state |bi (blue dots). (b) Momentum
variation with number of kicks; a state-ﬂipping π pulse occurs after
the 8th kick.

D. Optimizing the switch property

An ideal switch between diﬀerent momentum transfer
modes requires the wavefunction of one quantum accelera-
tor mode to have an overlap with the other mode at the time
of switching. From the FGR analysis, this implies that bet-
ter switching eﬃciency will occur when the stable islands in
pseudoclassical phase space for the two quantum accelerator
modes overlap [9].

This is illustrated in Fig. 5, where g = 7.26 ms−2, T =
131.0µs, φd = 0.6π and 3.8π for two diﬀerent states. The over-
lap between the stable islands for the lower kicking strength
[mode (1, 0), blue dots] and the higher kicking strength [mode
(4, 1), red dots] in Fig. 5(a) is greater than that in Figs. 1(e) and
1(f), or Figs. 3(e) and 3(f). This, as we would expect, leads to
a more eﬃcient transfer of population between the quantum
accelerator modes when the atomic internal state is ﬂipped by
a microwave pulse, as shown by the comparison between Fig.
5(b) and Fig. 4(b). About 80% of the atoms are successfully
transferred from one mode to the other.

The ǫ-classical map thus provides the capability of using
the overlap criterion to search in parameter space to ﬁnd the
best switching condition. A complete search of the relevant
phase space is a substantial enterprise, and will be part of
a longer term eﬀort to optimize the operation of a practical
random-walker.

IV. NEAR-IDEAL BIASED QUANTUM RANDOM WALK

We now turn to the implementation of a quantum random
walk using the state-dependent acceleration process we have
just described. Applying a π/2 microwave pulse after each
kick is equivalent to the “coin-ﬂipping” process introduced by
Aharanov in his discussion of a quantum random walk [10]. In
this section, we would like to show how we could use quantum
accelerator modes to implement a quantum random walk.

This scheme also introduces diﬀerent features from the
Aharanov model, and we therefore name this model a “bi-
ased” quantum random walk in momentum space.
In a bi-
ased quantum walk, the “coined” state, which determines the

Hadamard-style quantum random walk in momentum space.
It is important to note that atoms are divided to three dif-
ferent classes in the case of quantum accelerator modes con-
sidered here: two of them fall into two diﬀerent accelerator
modes, thus obtaining diﬀerent momentum changes in each
step, and the rest of the atoms are “left behind”. There is an
overall recoil in the opposite direction to the quantum acceler-
ator modes [25], but within this the motion is diﬀusive rather
than the coherent motion of quantum accelerator modes. In
order to understand better how such a system could be used to
realise a quantum random walk we propose the following sim-
pliﬁed model. Our model is a “biased quantum random walk”
for our coined quantum accelerator mode, where atoms not
only walk in two diﬀerent directions, but can be left behind.

modes increase the momentum of a group of atoms linearly
with the number of kicks, and this means that the eﬀective
“diﬀusion” of the biased walk will also be linearly propor-
tional to the number of kicks, or “superdiﬀusive.” We should
expect atoms moving faster in one direction than the other
due to the diﬀerence in the walking speeds of the two occu-
pied quantum accelerator modes. Walks with non-zero values
of the parameter γ have very diﬀerent distributions from those
with γ = 0. In particular walks with γ , 0 will ﬁll up the mo-
mentum gaps produced by a “pure” γ = 0 quantum random
walk.

From Fig. 5 about 80% of atoms have a good switch from
one mode to another and 20% are left behind, for appropriate
values of β, g, and φd. In this way, atoms could perform quan-
tum random walk for several steps. A future study to perfect
the switching property is necessary. The value of such walks
in search algorithms, and ways of varying γ, will be the sub-
ject of future work. In this paper we simply want to emphasis
the potential interest and value of state-dependent momentum
transfer in quantum accelerator modes, of the type we investi-
gate here.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have described a novel way to produce
state-dependent momentum transfer in a group of atoms. We
believe that this oﬀers a new route to produce quantum ran-
dom walks in the laboratory with feasible experimental pa-
rameters.
In particular, the next generation of experiments
with enhanced velocity selection will put practical realiza-
tions well within reach. The state-dependent walk controlled
through the parameters of the external perturbation is worthy
of investigation in its own right. There are three independent
control parameters in the basic δ-kicked accelerator, namely
the driving strength, the eﬀective gravitational acceleration,
and the value of the commutator |ǫ|. In an atom-optical con-
ﬁguration these can all be tuned independently. There are thus
many parameter regimes available particularly when consider-
ing the additional degrees of freedom oﬀered by superposition
states. The full range of such phenomena, and their relevance
to quantum random walks, quantum resonances and quantum
chaos in superposition states, awaits exploration.

[25] If all possible initial conditions are populated, i.e., the initial
distribution of atoms is large enough to cover several phase-
space cells, then in the freely-falling frame the average mo-
mentum is conserved. Thus, the unaccelerated cloud always on
average “recoils” from the quantum accelerator modes.

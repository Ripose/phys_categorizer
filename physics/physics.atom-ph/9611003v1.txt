Abstract

The retarded long-range potentials for hydrogen and alkali-metal atoms in

their ground states and a perfectly conducting wall are calculated. The po-

tentials are given over a wide range of atom-wall distances and the validity of

the approximations used is established.

The long-range interaction potential of an atom and a surface characterizes the physics

of many actual systems. For ground state alkali-metal atoms it has been measured by

deﬂection of atomic beams in scattering [1], reﬂection of atoms in atomic fountains [2,3],

and by combinations of deﬂection and spectroscopy [4,5]. As the atom-wall separation

increases the interaction potential weakens due to retardation arising from the ﬁnite speed

of light [6,7]. A retarded potential has been observed for Na atoms between parallel metallic

plates [5] and for the hydrogen atom inclusion of retardation in theoretical calculations of

hydrogen-liquid helium ﬁlm sticking coeﬃcients dramatically improves the agreement with

experiment [8,9]. In the present paper we present calculations of the retarded long-range

potentials for hydrogen and alkali-metal atoms and a perfectly conducting wall. When a

metallic wall has high reﬂectivity at the atomic resonance transition wavelengths in the

atomic electric dipole polarizability it can be treated as a perfectly conducting wall [10]

for atom-wall separations large enough that higher multipoles in the interaction and overlap

with the surface electrons are unimportant. Approximations proportional to the the retarded

potential for an atom and a perfectly conducting wall have been given for the corresponding

retarded potential for a dielectric wall [11,12]. Thus the present results may be useful in

analyzing the interactions of atoms with dielectric or metallic walls for spectroscopy or atom

interferometry experiments [13].

The retarded long-range potential V (R) of a spherically-symmetric ground state atom

and a perfectly conducting wall, where R is the atom-wall distance, was derived in 1948 by

Casimir and Polder [14]. It can be written [12]

V (R) =

∞

−1
4παfsR4 Z

dx α(ix/αfsR) exp(−2x)[2x2 + 2x + 1],

(1)

where α(iω) is the atomic dynamic electric dipole polarizability evaluated at imaginary

frequency iω and αfs = 1/137.035 989 5 is the ﬁne structure constant. We use atomic units

throughout. For small distances Eq. (1) has the limiting form

V (R) ∼ −C3/R3, R → 0,

(2)

where

As the distance increases, retardation arising from the ﬁnite speed of light becomes increas-

ingly important and V (R) approaches its asymptotic form, a simple power law,

where

V (R) ∼ V∞(R) ≡ −K4/R4, R → ∞,

K4 = 3α(0)/8παfs = 16.36 α(0).

A method has been developed to calculate directly the dynamic electric dipole polariz-

ability corresponding to an electron in the presence of a central core ﬁeld [15]. It gives the

function α(iω) for hydrogen exactly. Combined with a correction reﬂecting the polarization

of the alkali-metal core by the valence electron [15,16], we used it with a model potential

for the ﬁeld of the positive-ion core seen by the atomic valence electron [15] to obtain the

functions α′(iω) for the alkali-metal atoms, where the prime has been introduced to indi-

cate the results for the alkali-metal atoms obtained using this method. In determining the

correction, measured values of α(0) were adopted. For Li, K, Rb, and Cs the values of α(0)

are those given in Ref. [17]. For Na the value α(0) = 162.7 [13] was used, yielding a value of

the cutoﬀ radius rc = 2.860 812 8 in the core-polarization correction compared to the values

α(0) = 159.2 and rc = 0.379 266 0 of Ref. [15]. The values of α(0), and the corresponding

values of K4, are listed in Table I.

The calculated values for V (R) for hydrogen and the alkali-metal atoms are given in

Table II. Eq. (1) was integrated with a Gauss-Laguerre quadrature method. The results for

H are exact. In Fig. 1 plots of V (R) are presented for hydrogen and the alkali-metal atoms.

Hinds and Sandoghdar [10] calculated the discrete valence electron contributions to α(ω)

and evaluated the retarded long-range energy shift for ground state Rb. They presented the

results graphically for atom-wall distances from about 0.1 to 0.7 µm. For example, they

give a potential energy of −1.15 MHz at 0.106 µm (2000a0), in agreement with our value of

3

−1.162 MHz, obtained from Table I and Figure 1, where the energy, in MHz, was obtained

by multiplying the value of V (R) in a.u. by 6.580 × 109.

The function α′(iω) is an excellent approximation to the exact dynamic polarizability

α(iω) for photon energies ω greater than the ﬁrst excitation threshold of the core [18,19],

which means, accordingly, that V (R) will be most accurate for values of R >∼ 1/(αfsEopt),

where in atomic units, Eopt is the energy of the ﬁrst excitation transition. The model

potential method does not completely account for inner shell contributions to the oscillator

strength distribution and the resulting error in α′(iω) leads to a corresponding error in the

evaluation of V (R) for small R.

For Na, Kharchenko et al. [20] constructed a semi-empirical representation of the function

α(iω), which explicitly included core contributions, using a combination of theoretical and

experimental photoionization and photoabsorption cross sections, and evaluated V (R) using

Eq. (1). To determine the accuracy of the potentials in the present work, the ratio of the

potential obtained using α′(iω) to the potential obtained using the empirical α(iω) was

calculated.

It is given in Fig. 2. For Na, the optical transition energy is Eopt ∼ 0.077,

suggesting that the ratio should be near unity for R >∼ 1800, which it is, as seen in Fig. 2.

The potential calculated using α′(iω) underestimates the true potential by 5% at R = 200

and by 2% at R = 500.

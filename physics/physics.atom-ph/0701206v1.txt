Abstract

We investigate the resonant process of nuclear excitation by electron capture, in which a con-

tinuum electron is captured into a bound state of an ion with the simultaneous excitation of the

nucleus. In order to derive the cross section a Feshbach projection operator formalism is intro-

duced. Nuclear states and transitions are described by a nuclear collective model and making use

of experimental data. Transition rates and total cross sections for NEEC followed by the radiative

decay of the excited nucleus are calculated for various heavy ion collision systems.

INTRODUCTION

In the resonant process of nuclear excitation by electron capture (NEEC) a free electron is

captured into a bound atomic shell with the simultaneous excitation of the nucleus. It is the

nuclear physics analogue of dielectronic recombination (DR), where a resonant excitation

of a bound electron occurs. NEEC is the time-reversed process of internal conversion (IC).

The excited nucleus can then decay radiatively or by internal conversion. In the later case,

a resonant inelastic electron scattering on the nucleus occurs.

The NEEC recombination mechanism has been presented for the ﬁrst time in Ref.

[1].

Several studies have been made concerning NEEC in plasmas [1, 2] or in solid targets [3, 4, 5].

In [3], cross sections of the process are calculated through a scaling procedure applied to the

results of DR, considering that the two processes diﬀer only in their excitation mechanisms.

Following that, in Ref. [4], similar estimates of NEEC cross sections are obtained for the same

nuclei by using experimental nuclear rather than atomic data. A more theoretical approach

is provided in Ref. [2] through an explicit treatment of the electron-nucleus interaction in the

capture process, following the theory used for the calculation of IC coeﬃcients from Ref. [6].

In Ref.

[5], non-relativistic calculations are presented for the case of NEEC into bare ions

channeling through single crystals. The results are in disagreement with the previous ones

from [3, 4]. As NEEC has not been observed experimentally yet, neither in plasmas nor in

the case of ions in crystals or colliding with electron targets, the magnitude of its cross section

is in doubt. Similar discrepancies exist also in the case of theoretical calculations for the

similar process of nuclear excitation by electron transition (NEET). NEET is a fundamental

but rare mode of decay of an excited atomic state in which the energy of atomic excitation

is transferred to the nucleus. This corresponds to the time-reversed bound state internal

conversion. Unlike NEEC, NEET has been observed experimentally [7], in the same year in

which direct evidence of the bound internal conversion [8] has been reported, thus opening

a new period in which experimental precision allows atomic shell models to have regard

for the internal structure of the nucleus. The permanent development of the experimental

techniques and the enhanced possibilities of preparing bare ions and electron targets make

the experimental observation of NEEC a reasonable goal for the foreseeable future. Thus

theoretical calculations for NEEC occurring in scattering measurements are particularly

useful, especially in ﬁnding candidate isotopes and transitions suitable for experimental

2

observation.

In both NEEC and NEET, that are at the border-line between atomic and nuclear physics,

electronic orbital energy is converted directly into nuclear energy. They oﬀer therefore the

possibility to explore the spectral properties of heavy nuclei through atomic physics experi-

ments. Experimental techniques developed for scattering studies of electron recombination

with atomic ions, e.g. experiments with stored [9, 10] or trapped [11, 12] ions, can be applied

to gain information on the nuclear structure of several nuclides which is hardly accessible by

nuclear scattering experiments. Especially, NEEC is expected to allow the determination

of nuclear transition energies, the study of atomic vacancy eﬀects on nuclear lifetime and

population mechanisms of excited nuclear levels.

In this work we calculate total cross sections for NEEC followed by the radiative nuclear

decay for various transitions in heavy elements. Particular interest has been payed for

collision systems where experimental requirements for the observation of NEEC are likely

to be fulﬁlled.

In order to derive the cross section formula for the process we extended

the Feshbach projector formalism developed and used for the DR [13] to account for the

interaction of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. The electric and magnetic electron-

nucleus interactions are considered explicitly and the nucleus is described with the help

of a nuclear collective model [14]. The dynamics of electrons is governed by the Dirac

equation as required in the case of high-Z elements. This formalism is presented in Section

II. The calculation of the NEEC rates for the electric and magnetic transitions as well as the

nuclear model are described in Section III. Numerical results of the calculation are given in

Section IV. We conclude with a short Summary (Section V). The derivation of the magnetic

interaction operator related to Section II, as well as some larger formulas involved in Section

III are given in the Appendix. In this work atomic units have been used unless otherwise

mentioned.

II. THEORY OF NUCLEAR EXCITATION BY ELECTRON CAPTURE

In this section we derive the total cross section formula for the NEEC process followed

by the radiative decay of the excited nucleus. We consider that the electron is captured into

the bound state in the Coulomb ﬁeld of a bare nucleus and that only the nucleus is decaying

by emitting a photon. However, the derivation of the cross section can be extended to the

3

many-electron case in a straightforward way and also an additional radiative decay of the

electron can be treated by applying the formalism.

A. Decomposition of the Fock space by means of projection operators

The initial state

of the system consisting of the nucleus in its ground state, the

Ψii

|

free electron, and the vacuum state of the electromagnetic ﬁeld can be written as a direct

product of the nuclear, electronic, and photonic state vectors:

Ψii

Here, ~p is the asymptotic momentum of the electron, ms its spin projection, and

nuclear ground state. The state

formed by the resonant capture has the form

is a photon creation operator. The corresponding conjugate annihilation

To clearly separate these states in the perturbative expansion of the transition operator,

we introduce operators projecting onto the individual subspaces. Characterizing the state

of the electron in the positive part of the continuous spectrum by the energy ε rather than

the momentum of the free electron, we write the projector P belonging to the ﬁrst type of

subspace as

For brevity we introduce the multi-index α to stand for all discrete quantum numbers of the

total system. The projection operator of the subspace spanned by states of the type (2) is

written as

Assuming corrections due to two- or more-photon states [15] and due to the presence of

the negative electronic continuum to be negligible, we postulate the following completeness

relation:

where 1 is the unity operator of the Fock space.

P + Q + R = 1 ,

B. The total Hamiltonian of the system

The total Hamiltonian operator for the system consisting of the nucleus, the electron,

and the radiation ﬁeld can be written as

H = Hn + He + Hr + Hen + Her + Hnr .

(9)

The Hamiltonian of the nucleus Hn is written in terms of the nuclear collective model [14]
by using creation and annihilation operators of the collective modes, B†

λµ and Bλµ,

where Ωλ are the phonon frequencies. The Dirac Hamiltonian of the free electron is given

by

whilst the pure quantized radiation ﬁeld is described by

Interactions between the three subsystems are described by the three remaining Hamiltoni-

ans in eq. (9). We adopt the Coulomb gauge for the electron-nucleus interaction because it

allows the separation of the dominant Coulomb attraction between the electronic and the

nuclear degrees of freedom,

Hen =

.

In eq. (13), ρn(~rn) is the nuclear charge density and the integration is performed over the

whole nuclear volume. The interaction of the electron with the transverse photon ﬁeld

quantized in unit volume is given by

Her =

~ǫ~kσei~k·~rea~kσ + h.c.
(cid:16)
(cid:17)
Here, ~α is the vector of the Dirac α matrices (αx, αy, αz), and ~ǫ~kσ is the polarization vector
of the photons. Similarly, the interaction of the nucleus with the electromagnetic ﬁeld is

where ~jn(~rn) is the nuclear current.

Using the projection operators we can separate the Hamiltonian as follows:

with

H = H0 + V

H0 = P HP + QHQ + RHR ,

H

≡

−

H0 = P HQ + QHP + P HR + RHP

+ RHQ + QHR .

(13)

(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

In this way the eﬀect of the nuclear potential on bound and continuum electron states is

included to all orders. The individual terms in the perturbation operator describe transitions

between the diﬀerent subspaces. For example, P HQ describes the transition of the bound

electron to the continuum, i.e.

IC, and QHP accounts for the time-reversed process of

IC, namely, NEEC. P HR and RHP are the lowest-order operators for photoionization and

radiative recombination, respectively. QHR and RHQ account for the radiative excitation

of the nucleus and radiative decay of the nucleus or of the electron in a bound state.

C. Perturbation expansion of the transition operator

The transition operator is deﬁned as

where G(z) is the Green operator of the system given by

T (z) = V + V G(z)V ,

G(z) = (z

H)−1 .

−

(19)

(20)

Here, z is a complex energy variable. The cross section for a process can be expressed by

the transition operator as follows:

Ψf |
with the Ψf and Ψi as ﬁnal and initial eigenstates of H0, respectively. This cross section is

2π
Fi

diﬀerential with respect to the angle Ωk of the photon emitted in the process. Fi denotes

the ﬂux of the incoming electrons, and ρf the density of the ﬁnal photonic states.

We use the Lippmann-Schwinger equation to write the perturbation series for T (z) in

powers of V with the Green function G0(z) of the unperturbed Hamiltonian H0:

T (z) = V + V G0(z)V + V G0(z)V G0(z)V + . . . .

(22)

Since the initial state of the NEEC process is by deﬁnition an eigenstate of P , and the ﬁnal

state is an eigenstate of R, we consider the projection RT P of the transition operator:

RT P = RV P + RV G0V P + RV G0V G0V P

+ RV G0V G0V G0V P + . . .

(23)

Here and in the following we omit the argument z. The ﬁrst term in eq. (23) does not

contribute to the NEEC process. After a further analysis of the second term RV G0V P =

RHnrQG0QHenP and inserting the spectral resolution (6) of Q in the second order in V we

arrive to

(25)

The ﬁrst two terms do not contribute to the cross section of the considered NEEC process.

The last term is decomposed as

+RHerQG0QHnrRG0RHerP

+RHnrQG0QHerRG0RHerP

+RHnrQG0QHnrRG0RHerP .

(26)

Here, the ﬁrst two terms are not considered, as they describe recombination by radiative

decay of the electron. The process incorporated in the third term of (26) is not possible.

The remaining last term, QHnrRG0RHerP , accounts for the capture of the free electron by

exchanging a virtual transverse photon with the nucleus. As we show in Appendix A, it can

be approximated by QHmagnP , where

The ﬁrst term describes the emission and reabsorption of a photon by the electron recom-

bined into the bound state. Its diagonal matrix element possesses a real and an imaginary

The imaginary part is the radiative decay rate of the electronic state and vanishes in the case

of electron capture into the ground state of the ion. The second term in (35) describes the

emission and a subsequent reabsorption of a virtual photon by the nucleus, and its diagonal

matrix element reads

experimental nuclear excitation energies.

Continuing the expansion (23) of the T operator, the matrix element of the intermediate

state Green operator in fourth order contains terms of the form

whose value can be taken from experimental data or from calculations involving diﬀerent

nuclear models. Given the diﬀerent parity of the electric and magnetic multipole moments

a transition of a given multipolarity L is either electric or magnetic. We consider only

the cases of transitions with a certain value of L and we neglect the possible mixing ratios

between electric and magnetic multipoles of diﬀerent multipolarities.

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS

We calculate total cross sections and resonance strengths for NEEC followed by the

radiative decay of the excited nucleus for various collision systems, involving electric E2 and

magnetic M1 multipole transitions. We consider the cases of nuclear isotopes with low-lying

nuclear levels for which the NEEC process is more likely to be observed experimentally.

For the case of electric multipole transitions we have considered the 0+

The quadrupole excitations of even-even nuclei are well described by the collective model.

For the calculation of the NEEC rate both formulas from eq. (64) and eq. (66) have been

used for a comparison. A further E2 transition 5

of the odd 163

66 Dy nucleus has been

investigated. For this case we have calculated the NEEC rate assuming that the electron

does not enter the nucleus. The reduced transition probability B

nuclei as well as the energies of the nuclear levels were taken from [20], and in the case of the

163
66 Dy isotope, from [21]. The nuclear radiative rate was calculated according to the formula

eq. (64) and eq. (66). We use relativistic Coulomb-Dirac wave functions for the continuum

electron and wave functions calculated with the GRASP92 package [23] considering a homo-

geneously charged nucleus for the bound electron. The value of RL,jd,j is almost the same

whether we use Coulomb-Dirac radial wave functions or we take into account the ﬁnite size

of the nucleus. The ﬁnite size of the nucleus has a sensitive eﬀect on the energy levels of the

bound electron. The energy level of the bound electron is calculated with GRASP92 and it

includes quantum electrodynamic corrections. The ﬁrst term of the sum of radial integrals

in eq. (67) is about 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the second term,

the NEEC rate is exactly the one in (64), calculated with the assumption that the electron

does not enter the nucleus. For the numerical cases of the even-even nuclei the diﬀerence

between the rates calculated with eq. (64) and eq. (66) are from under 1% up to 6%. The

diﬀerence is larger for the capture into the s orbitals and it increases with the value of the

atomic number Z. For the capture of the continuum electron into the 2s orbital of 248

96 Cm,

the value of the rate calculated using the non-penetrating approximation is 6% larger than

the one calculated with the collective model, in which the restriction on the electron motion

is avoided.

For the cases of the U isotopes and for 248

96 Cm, the capture into the K shell is not pos-

sible due to the low energy level of the ﬁrst excited nuclear state. For these 3 isotopes,

recombination into the L shell of initially He-like ions is the most probable one. We re-

gard the capture of the electron into a closed shell conﬁguration as a one-electron problem,

without the participation of the K-shell electrons. We consider for the continuum electron

a total screening, while the bound electron is described by wave functions for an extended

nucleus. The electron interaction is included in the bound radial wave functions calculated

with GRASP92 and it inﬂuences the results through the value of the bound energy and

through the shape of the electronic radial wave functions. The change of the shape of the

radial wave functions has a larger numerical contribution to the value of the NEEC rate

than the change of the energy due to the electron-electron interaction.

For the other cases of even-even nuclei, capture into the K shell is possible. For the 156

64 Gd,
66 Dy isotopes we have also considered the capture into the He-like ions. The

66 Dy, and 163
162
width of the nuclear state in eq. (80) contains then an extra term which accounts for the

possible IC of the K-shell electrons. The capture rate into the 2p orbitals is in general one

order of magnitude larger than the one for the capture into the 2s orbital. The NEEC rates

and resonance strengths for NEEC followed by the radiative decay of the nucleus for electric

transitions are presented in Table I . The values of the NEEC rates have been calculated

using the non-penetrating approximation.

For the magnetic multipole transitions we consider the M1 transitions of the odd isotopes

70 Yb, 55

67 Ho, 173
165
ions are presented in Table II. The electronic radial integrals are calculated numerically

75 Re. Numerical results for these

using the same type of wave functions for the bound and continuum electron as for the

electric transitions. The reduced magnetic transition probability B

(M1) and the energies

↓

of the nuclear levels are taken from [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. Capture into the K

shell is possible for all the chosen ions, except for the 157

shells is less probable, and already for the capture into the 2s orbital of 167

64 Gd isotope. Capture into the higher
67 Ho, the NEEC

rate is one order of magnitude smaller. We present also results for captures into the He-like

ions of 155

64 Gd and 157

1s orbital of 173

64 Gd. The largest resonance strength is the one for the capture into the
eV. This value is small in comparison with

In Figure 1 we present the cross section for the capture of the continuum electron into the

2p1/2 and 2p3/2 orbitals of the two studied even-even uranium isotopes. The cross sections for

the capture into the 2p3/2 orbitals are larger than the ones into the 2p1/2 orbitals. Although

the cross section values are in the order of thousands of barns, the width of the Lorentzian

is given by the width of the excited nuclear state, which is in the order of 10−7 eV. This

validates the use of the isolated resonance approximation in Section II C.

SUMMARY

In this article we present a versatile formalism for describing complex processes actively

involving atomic electrons and nuclei and derive a total cross section formula for the process

of NEEC. The cross section can be traced back to the calculation of IC rates and radiative

transition rates. It also requires the knowledge of nuclear excitation energies and the bound

state energy of the electron after capture.

We derive NEEC rates for the case of both electric and magnetic multipole transitions

using relativistic electronic wave functions. For the bound electron we use radial wave

functions which take into account the ﬁnite size of the nucleus. The nucleus is described

using a nuclear collective model. The nuclear part of the matrix element is written with the

help of the reduced nuclear transition probability whose value is taken from experiment.

We calculate numerically the cross sections for NEEC followed by the radiative decay of

FIG. 1: NEEC cross sections for Uranium isotopes as a function of the continuum electron energy

the excited nuclear state for various nuclei. Particular interest is payed to the cases that are

more likely to be observed experimentally. The obtained resonance strengths are typically

4 orders of magnitude smaller than the DR ones, which is due to the small width of the

excited nuclear states.

If the initial and ﬁnal states for NEEC are the same as the ones for the process of radiative

recombination (RR), quantum interference between the two processes occurs. The cross

section for RR is much larger than the one of NEEC, therefore, the inclusion of interference

terms is expected to increase the cross section by several orders of magnitude, making the

experimental observation of NEEC feasible. Calculations about the magnitude of this eﬀect

are in progress.

In this Appendix we show that the term QHnrRG0RHerP can be approximated by

QHmagnP , where we introduced the Hamiltonian

describing the magnetic interaction of the nuclear and electric currents due to the exchange

of a transverse photon. The replacement is valid in the case when the frequency of the

virtual photon is negligible, or, in other terms, when its wavelength is large compared to the

typical linear size of the total system.

In this derivation we use the second quantized forms

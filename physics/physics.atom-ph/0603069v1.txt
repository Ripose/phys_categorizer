The optical theorem is applied to the process of electron-positron pair creation in the superposition
of a nuclear Coulomb and a strong laser ﬁeld. We derive new representations for the total production
rate as two-fold integrals, both for circular laser polarization and for the general case of elliptic
polarization, which has not been treated before. Our approach allows us to obtain by analytical
means the asymptotic behaviour of the pair creation rate for various limits of interest. In particular,
we consider pair production by two-photon absorption and show that, close to the energetic threshold
of this process, the rate obeys a power law in the laser frequency with diﬀerent exponents for linear
and circular laser polarization. With the help of the upcoming x-ray laser sources our results could
be tested experimentally.

INTRODUCTION

×

Studies of electron-positron pair production in strong ex-
ternal ﬁelds are an important tool to reveal the struc-
ture of the QED vacuum. Dynamical pair creation by
two Coulomb ﬁelds in relativistic heavy ion collisions has
been analysed in great detail, both theoretically and ex-
perimentally (see, e.g., [1] for a topical review). In recent
years, due to the sustained progressing of laser technol-
ogy, pair creation in strong laser ﬁelds is encountering a
growing interest. In several theoretical papers pair pro-
duction in the standing wave formed by two counterprop-
agating laser beams has been considered [2].
In most
cases a laser ﬁeld strength of order or above the critical
1016 V/cm is required in order to ob-
value Ec = 1.3
serve the process in experiment [3], which still is by four
orders of magnitude larger than the highest laser ﬁeld
strengths achievable today [4]. More promising in view
of its experimental realization is pair production in the
combination of a laser and a Coulomb ﬁeld. Here one can
exploit the possibility to let a nucleus or a highly charged
ion collide at large value of the relativistic Lorentz factor
γ with the laser beam. Then, in the nuclear rest frame,
the laser’s ﬁeld strength E and frequency ω are enhanced
2γ. Observable pair creation rates should

mc2 in this frame (here, ~, c

and m are Planck’s constant, light velocity and electron
mass, respectively). With the help of the upcoming novel
laser [5] and accelerator [6] facilities these conditions can
be met. The Large Hadron Collider, that is presently
under construction at CERN (Geneva, Switzerland), will

rest frame approaches or even exceeds the critical value.
On the other hand, the x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL)
facilities presently being developed at DESY (Hamburg,
Germany) and SLAC (Stanford, USA) are proposed to
provide spatially coherent and highly brilliant beams of
synchrotron radiation with single-photon energies of up
10−6Ec
to 8
[5]. When combined with a moderately relativistic ion
beam, the laser photon energy in the projectile frame
can reach the electron’s rest energy.
We should mention that a few years ago nonlinear
electron-positron pair creation in the collision of an ul-
105) and an intense
trarelativistic electron beam (γ
optical laser pulse was observed at SLAC [7]. In this sit-
uation, there are two channels for pair production: A di-
rect channel, via laser-photon absorption in the Coulomb
ﬁeld of the electron, and an indirect two-step channel (so-
called Breit-Wheeler process), where ﬁrst a high-energy
photon is generated by Compton backscattering which af-
terwards creates the pair via absorption of laser photons
[8].
In the experiment the contribution of the indirect
channel was shown to be dominant. In the present paper,
however, the indirect production mechanism will not be
addressed. It is of importance only in the case of a light
projectile beam.
In fact, when the incoming electrons
were replaced by a beam of heavy particles (e.g., pro-
tons) the indirect production channel would be strongly
suppressed and direct nonlinear pair production (by a
virtual photon from the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld) could be
investigated. The latter process is the subject of this
paper.
The ﬁrst calculation of pair creation by a Coulomb and
a strong laser ﬁeld is due to Yakovlev [9]. He treated the
case of circular laser polarization and derived asymptotic
formulae for the production rate in certain parameter
regimes. Particularly, the total cross sections in the per-
1, with the intensity parameter ξ
turbative regime (ξ
given in Eq. (3) below) as well as in the overcritical-ﬁeld
limit (ξ
Ec) were obtained. Twenty years
later, Mittleman [10] considered the process in a linearly

polarized laser wave. His calculation of the leading term
for the total cross section in the perturbative multiphoton
mc2) led him to the conclusion
regime (ξ
that, for the laser intensities and frequencies available
at that time, this cross section was the smallest one on
record. Despite of this pessimistic result, another twenty
years later the great headway in laser technology that
was following the invention of chirped-pulse ampliﬁcation
[11] triggered newly revived interest in the process. Dietz
and Pr¨obsting [12] investigated the inﬂuence of a highly
charged ion of charge Z
100 within a nonperturbative
numerical approach. However, to make their coupled-
channel calculations feasible they treated the laser ﬁeld
in dipole approximation. While in the earlier work the
nucleus was always assumed at rest, M¨uller, Voitkiv, and
Gr¨un explored in detail the improved opportunities aris-
ing from laser-nucleus collisions. In the articles [13, 14]
they performed numerical calculations for tunneling pair
production by an ultrarelativistic nucleus colliding with a
superintense near-infrared laser beam and for multipho-
ton pair creation by a moderately relativistic ion beam in
combination with an intense x-ray laser wave. Moreover,
they considered the variant of bound-free pair produc-
tion where the electron is created in a bound state of
the projectile nucleus [15]. Free pair creation in the col-
lision of a relativistic nucleus with an ultrastrong x-ray
laser of circular polarization was also treated by Avetis-
sian, Avetissian, Mkrtchian, and Sedrakian in Ref. [16],
where analytical formulae in the high-intensity limit and
some numerical results on the energy spectrum of the cre-
ated particles in the nonperturbative multiphoton regime
(ξ
Most of the treatments mentioned above fully account
for the inﬂuence of the external laser ﬁeld by using the
Volkov solutions to the Dirac equation as basis states in
a perturbative calculation of ﬁrst order with respect to
the nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld. Within this framework, the
fully diﬀerential pair creation rate can be expressed as a
Fourier series over the number of absorbed laser photons,
the coeﬃcients of which are essentially given by ordinary
or generalized Bessel functions for circular or linear laser
polarization, respectively. Because of the large photon
numbers involved, taking this sum is one of the main ob-
stacles in this kind of approach, in particular for a linearly
polarized laser wave. As a consequence, it is diﬃcult to
get useable expressions for the total production rate.
In the present paper a diﬀerent approach based on the
optical theorem is used to calculate the total rate for
pair creation in combined laser and Coulomb ﬁelds. This
approach employs the explicit form of the polarization
operator of a photon in a laser ﬁeld found by Baier, Mil-
stein, and Strakhovenko [17] by means of an operator
technique. An alternative form of this polarization oper-
ator was derived independently by Becker and Mitter [18]
by means of another method. Both results are in agree-
ment with each other. Similar to Refs. [9, 10, 13, 14, 16]
the interaction of the leptons with the laser ﬁeld is taken
into account to all orders while the eﬀect of the Coulomb

mc2) are given.

FIG. 1: Pictorial equation in terms of Feynman diagrams de-
scribing e+e−
pair production in combined laser and Coulomb
ﬁelds. In our approach, the Coulomb ﬁeld is treated within
the ﬁrst order of perturbation theory, while the eﬀect of the
laser wave is nonperturbatively taken into account to all or-
ders. This is expressed by the Feynman graph on the left-hand
side, where the double lines represent the exact lepton wave-
functions in the laser ﬁeld (Volkov states), while the dashed
line stands for their interaction with the Coulomb ﬁeld. Ex-
panding the Volkov states with respect to the lepton-laser
coupling results in a perturbation series, some typical low-
order terms of which are shown on the right-hand side. The
wavy lines symbolize the laser photons and the arrows indicate
whether the respective laser photon is emitted or absorbed
during the process. The ﬁrst diagram on the right-hand side,
e.g., describes the leading order of pair production by the net-
absorption of one laser photon (with ~ω > 2mc2). For later
reference, we note that the interference between the ﬁrst and
the fourth diagram leads to a ξ2-correction to the probability
for one-photon pair creation [cf. Eq. (34) below].

ﬁeld is treated in ﬁrst order (cf. Fig. 1). The main ad-
vantage of our method is the possibility to derive, inde-
pendent of the laser’s polarization state, in an analytical
manner compact formulae for the total production rate
that only involve low-dimensional integrals and no addi-
tional summations. Based on these representations one
can rather easily ﬁnd all diﬀerent kinds of asymptotics.
In this way we will conﬁrm and extend previous results
for a circularly polarized laser wave and give for the ﬁrst
time corresponding expressions for elliptic laser polariza-
tion. As a main result, we show that there are essential
diﬀerences between the general case of an elliptically po-
larized laser ﬁeld and the special case of circular polariza-
tion. Furthermore, because of its interest for near-future
experiments, particular emphasis is placed on the nonlin-
ear process of pair creation by the simultaneous absorp-
tion of two photons from the laser wave in a situation,
where the energy of a single photon is not suﬃcient to
produce a pair and where the contribution from higher
photon orders is neglibly small. We note that, in gen-
eral, contributions stemming from diﬀerent net-numbers
of absorbed laser photons can be distinguished via the
momentum spectra of the produced particles. In addi-
tion, the strong-ﬁeld regimes of pair production shall be

examined.
The paper is organized as follows. In the next section we
describe how the polarization operator is related to the
process of pair creation, and how it can be used to calcu-
late the total pair production rate in the superposition of
a Coulomb and a laser ﬁeld. General formulae are given
in terms of two-fold integrals for both circular and ellip-
tic laser polarization. In the following section we apply
these expressions to various parameter regions and deter-
mine the corresponding asymptotic behaviour of the pair
production rate. Special attention is paid to the nonlin-
ear process of pair production by two-photon absorption
in the limit of low laser intensity, for which in particu-
lar the behaviour close to the energetic threshold is in-
vestigated. Moreover, the pair-creation cross-section in
the high-frequency limit (~ω
mc2) is analysed, where
we calculate the next-to-leading order correction to one-
photon pair production at low intensity and analyse the
limiting case of high laser intensity. Finally, we consider
the overcritical-ﬁeld regime as well as the quasiclassical
limit of high intensity and low frequency, where the rate
shows an exponential tunneling behaviour. We ﬁnish
with a conclusion where the signiﬁcance of our results in
view of possible experimental investigations is discussed.

II. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

A. The polarization operator and pair production

The polarization operator Πµν (k) describes the propaga-
tion of a photon of four-momentum kµ in a background
ﬁeld (e.g., the QED vacuum), including self-energy cor-
rections. It is related to the corresponding exact photon
µν (k) via Dyson’s equation [19]
propagator

D

Dµν(k) = Dµν(k) + Dµσ(k)

4π Dλν (k)

(1)

Πσλ(k)

where Dµν(k) denotes the free photon propagator.
In
Refs. [17, 18] the (properly renormalized) polarization op-
erator was evaluated in the combined ﬁelds of the QED
vacuum and a classical electromagnetic plane wave. The
interaction with the vacuum was taken into account to
ﬁrst order in the ﬁne-structure constant α = e2, with e
being the electron charge, while the interaction with the
plane-wave ﬁeld was included to all orders. In the follow-
ing, the shape of the electromagnetic wave will be taken
as

A(L)

µ (x) = a1µ cos(κx) + a2µ sin(κx)

four-vectors. The respective result on the polarization
operator of a photon in a constant electric ﬁeld instead
of a plane electromagnetic wave can be found in Ref. [20].
Apart from its theoretical signiﬁcance, the knowledge of
the polarization operator allows for a number of applica-
tions. For example, the total probability for e+e− pair
production by a photon of momentum k in an external
ﬁeld (e.g., a plane laser wave) is related to the imaginary
part of the corresponding polarization operator via [19]

W =

ǫµǫ∗
ν
k0 ImΠµν (k)
where ǫµ denotes the photon’s polarization four-vector.
In Fig. 2 we give an intuitive, pictorial explanation of this
formula.

FIG. 2: Lowest order (in α) Feynman graph for the polar-
ization operator of a photon in an external laser ﬁeld. In our
case the photon is a virtual one stemming from a Coulomb
ﬁeld (outer dashed lines). The diagram can be viewed as de-
scribing the elastic forward scattering of the photon through
an intermediate laser-dressed e+e−
state (double line). By
performing, as indicated, a cut along the central dashed line,
it is seen that the graph represents the product of the ampli-
tude for the production of a laser-dressed e+e− pair by the
virtual photon and its complex conjugate, including a sum
over all electron states. Application of the optical theorem
(i.e., the unitarity of the scattering matrix) therefore relates
the imaginary part of the polarization operator with the total
probability for pair creation, as expressed by Eqs. (4) and (5).

B. Pair creation in combined laser and Coulomb
ﬁelds

The calculation in Ref. [17] was performed for an arbi-
trary photon momentum kµ, including the case k2
= 0.
Therefore, the polarization operator found there not only
applies to the combination ”photon + laser wave”. In-
stead, the photon may be replaced by any additional
external ﬁeld A(ext)
(k), e.g. a nuclear Coulomb ﬁeld.
Since a Coulomb ﬁeld can transfer momentum but not
energy, here one has kµ = (0, q). To get, at a given
value of q, the diﬀerential probability (per unit time) for

µ

e+e− pair creation one has to replace the photon wave-
function A(ph)
4π/2k0ǫµ in Eq. (4) by the Fourier
(k) =
transform of the Coulomb ﬁeld A(C)
µ (q) = (4πZe/q2)δµ0.
Here, Z denotes the nuclear charge number. The total
production rate then is found by integration over all pos-
sible momenta:

Note that in Eq. (5) the additional factor of 1/2 compen-

the momenta q and

mogeneous electromagnetic ﬁeld the relation (5) was used
in Ref. [21], where the probability for pair production was
found within the quasiclassical approximation for the po-
larization operator.

III. SPECIAL CASES

A. One-photon limit

≪

Let us consider the case of small intensity (ξ
1) and
frequency ω > 2m. The leading term in the ξ2-expansion
corresponds to pair creation by a single photon in a
Coulomb ﬁeld. Under these circumstances the total pro-
duction probability is independent of the laser’s polariza-
tion state and it is convenient to derive the asymptotic
behaviour by using the formula (11) for circular laser
1, we can expand the expo-
polarization. Assuming ξ
nentials to lowest order with respect to y. Afterwards we
perform the integration over ρ with the result

It is interesting to consider the cross section for two-

1, which represents a
nonlinear strong-ﬁeld process of lowest possible order
in the number of absorbed photons. We assume that
m < ω < 2m, which excludes the possibilty of one-
photon pair creation. Going one step further in the y-
expansion of Eq. (11) and performing the ρ-integration,
we obtain for the circular polarization case

Hence, in the general case, the cross section for two-
photon pair creation close to threshold raises like the sec-
ond power of the excess energy ω
m. Only in the special
case of circular polarization (µ = 0) the threshold cross
section scales with the fourth power as given in Eq. (25).
We notice, however, that our ﬁrst-order treatment of the
Coulomb ﬁeld requires the parameter Zα/v± to be small,
where v± denote the velocities of the created particles.
For pair production very close to the threshold, Coulomb
corrections are expected to be important. A summary of
our results on two-photon pair production for linear and
circular polarization including various approximations is
displayed in Fig. 3.

×

When applying our general formula (26) to the same pa-
rameters as above but for a linearly polarized laser wave
10−4, ξ2 = 0, ω = 900 keV, and
(µ = 1, ξ1/√2 = 7.5
Z = 1), we get a total production rate of 290 sec−1, which
is in rather good agreement with the corresponding value
of 240 sec−1 found in Ref.
[14]. The diﬀerence is most
likely due to small inaccuracies in the 5-dimensional in-
tegration along with the numerical evaluation of the gen-
eralized Bessel functions in Ref.
[14]. As is seen from
Fig. 3, the pair production rate for a linearly polarized
laser wave is noticeably larger than the corresponding
rate for circular laser polarization within the whole fre-
quency range m < ω < 2m.

to Eqs. (24) and (28).

C. High-frequency limit

In this subsection we analyse the high-energy behaviour
of strong-ﬁeld pair creation, i.e., we shall assume ω

but allow for arbitrary value of ξ. Let us ﬁrst consider
the circular polarization case and start from Eq. (12). We
exchange the order of integration and ﬁrst integrate over

In a similar way we can derive from Eq. (14) the η
1
limit for an elliptically polarized laser wave. To this end,
we assume η1 > η2 and (η2
η1, where ηj =
1 −
ωξj/m for j = 1, 2. The latter condition means, that
the laser ﬁeld is considerably diﬀerent from a circularly
polarized wave. Then we ﬁnd

In comparison with the result for circular polarization
in Eq. (41), the production rate in Eq. (42) is suppressed
by an additional factor of √η1. This suppression has
the same nature as in the case of e+e− pair production
by a real photon in a laser ﬁeld [24]. The reason for
the suppression is that, in general, the modulus of the
ﬁeld strength is truely oscillating, while in a circularly
polarized wave it has a constant value. We note that
Eq. (42) can also be derived by averaging Eq. (41) over
one oscillation cycle.

We have investigated in detail the total probability for
electron-positron pair creation by a nuclear Coulomb
ﬁeld and an intense laser ﬁeld. Employing the optical
theorem in connection with the known polarization op-
erator of a photon in an electromagnetic plane wave, we
have derived compact, general expressions for the total
pair production rate and found explicit formulae for vari-
ous intensity and frequency regimes of interest. We have
demonstrated that signiﬁcant diﬀerences exist between
the general case of an elliptically polarized laser wave
and the special case of circular polarization [see, e.g.,
Eqs. (28) and (42) versus Eqs. (24) and (41)]. Particular
emphasize was placed on the nonlinear process of two-
photon pair creation.
Let us estimate the feasibility of e+e− pair production
using an XFEL beam [3, 5] and a beam of relativistic
protons. We will compare the following possible regimes
of interaction: 1) the one-photon perturbative regime,
m [see Eq. (18)], 2) the two-
where ξ
1 and m < ω <
photon perturbative regime, where ξ
2m [see Eq. (26)], 3) the tunneling regime, where ξ
1
m/ω [see Eq. (41)], and 4) the overcritical-ﬁeld
and ξ
≪
regime, where ξ
m/ω [see Eq. (40)]. We
have to take into account that the mentioned formulae
are valid in the rest frame of the proton, which moves
with a large Lorentz-factor γ. In the rest frame of the
proton, the photon frequency is increased with respect to
2γωL, while the XFEL
its value in the lab frame: ω
pulse duration is decreased: τ
τL/2γ. Here, ωL and
τL denote the laser frequency and pulse duration in the
lab frame, respectively. Note that, nowadays, the proton
beam at DESY can be accelerated up to 920 GeV, which
corresponds to γ
For the following estimates, we will throughout assume
an XFEL pulse duration of τL = 100 fs. The XFEL beam
collides with a bunch of protons moving at γ = 1000, con-
taining 1011 particles, and having a beam radius of 30
µm.
In the one-photon perturbative regime, assuming
an XFEL photon energy of ωL = 10 keV, an intensity
parameter of ξ = 10−5, and a beam radius of R = 30
µm, we ﬁnd that
100 pairs are produced per colli-
sion. For a given laser intensity, the number of created
particles is independent of the laser’s polarization state.
In the second regime of two-photon pair creation, em-
ploying a linearly polarized XFEL beam is more favor-
able. Supposing the collision parameters ωL = 0.5 keV,
10−3, and R = 30 µm, the process proceeds far
ξ1 = 3
above threshold and one pair can be produced per shot.
In the overcritical-ﬁeld regime, circular polarization of
the XFEL beam leads to higher production yields.
In
this regime, a large ξ-value is necessary, which can be
achieved by focusing the XFEL beam [3]. For ξ = 3,
ωL = 10 keV and R = 0.4 nm, one pair can be produced
per collision. Here one has to take into account that the
XFEL pulse will interact only with a very small fraction
of the proton bunch. For the assumed parameters, the

Thus, we see that, in principle, experimental studies of
the pair production process are possible by using an
XFEL and a relativistic proton beam. Employing a
non-focused XFEL beam (cf.
the so-called design and
available parameters in Table 1 of Ref. [3]) and an ultra-
relativistic proton beam, the perturbative regimes of pair
creation can be realized, including nonlinear pair produc-
tion via two-photon absorption. The realization of the
strong-ﬁeld regimes with ξ

a result, the pair creation seems unrealistic in the tun-

In summary, with the novel sources of spatially coherent
x-rays along with the relativistic proton beams of DESY,
the results on pair production presented in this paper
could be tested.

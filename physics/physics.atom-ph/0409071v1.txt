Two-step method for precise calculation of core properties in molecules

Precise calculations of core properties in heavy-atom systems which are described by the opera-

tors heavily concentrated in atomic cores, like to hyperﬁne structure and P,T-parity nonconservation

eﬀects, usually require accounting for relativistic eﬀects. Unfortunately, completely relativistic treat-

ment of molecules containing heavy elements is very consuming already at the stages of calculation

and transformation of two-electron integrals with a basis set of four-component spinors.

In turn, the relativistic eﬀective core potential (RECP) calculations of valence (spectroscopic,

chemical etc.) properties of molecules are very popular because the RECP method allows one to

treat quite satisfactory the correlation and relativistic eﬀects for the valence electrons of a molecule

and to reduce signiﬁcantly the computational eﬀorts. The valence molecular spinors are usually

smoothed in atomic cores and, as a result, direct calculation of electronic densities near heavy nuclei

is impossible.

In the paper, the methods of nonvariational and variational one-center restoration of correct shapes

of four-component spinors in atomic cores after a two-component RECP calculation of a molecule

are discussed. Their eﬃciency is illustrated in correlation calculations of hyperﬁne structure and

parity nonconservation eﬀects in heavy-atom molecules YbF, BaF, TlF, and PbO.

INTRODUCTION

Historical background of study P- and T-parity nonconservation eﬀects in heavy-atom molecules. After discovery
of the combined charge (C) and space (P) parity violation, or CP-violation, in K 0-meson decay [1], the search for the

electric dipole moments (EDMs) of elementary particles has become one of the most fundamental problems in physics

[2, 3, 4, 5]. Permanent EDM is induced by the weak interaction that breaks both the space symmetry inversion

and time-reversal invariance (T) [6]. Considerable experimental eﬀort has been invested in measuring atomic EDMs

induced by the EDMs of proton, neutron and electron and by P,T-odd interactions between them. The best available

earlier [11] that the P- and P,T-parity nonconservation (PNC) eﬀects are strongly enhanced in heavy-atom systems

due to relativistic and other eﬀects. For example, in paramagnetic atoms the enhancement factor for an electron

In 1978 the experimental investigation of the electron EDM and other PNC eﬀects was further stimulated by
Labzowsky et al. [15, 16] and Sushkov & Flambaum [17] who clariﬁed the possibilities of additional enhancement
of these eﬀects in diatomic radicals like BiS and PbF due to the closeness of levels of opposite parity in Ω-doublets
having the 2Π1/2 ground state. Then Sushkov et al. [18] and Flambaum & Khriplovich [19] have suggested to use Ω-
doubling in diatomic radicals with the 2Σ1/2 ground state for such experiments and the HgF, HgH and BaF molecules
were ﬁrst studied semiempirically by Kozlov [20]. At the same time, the ﬁrst two-step ab initio calculation of PNC
eﬀects in PbF initiated by Labzowsky was ﬁnished in St.-Petersburg (Russia) [21]. A few years later, Hinds started

experimental search for the electron EDM on the YbF molecule, on which the ﬁrst result was obtained by his group in

New series of the electron EDM experiments on YbF by Hinds group (London, UK) are in progress and new

generation of the electron EDM experiments using a vapor cell, on the metastable a(1) state of PbO, is prepared

by group of DeMille (Yale, USA). The unique suitability of PbO for searching the elusive de is demonstrated by the
very high statistical sensitivity of the Yale experiment to the electron EDM. In prospect, it allows one to detect de
of order of 10−31 e
cm [23], three–four orders of magnitude lower than the current limit quoted above. Some other
·
candidates for the EDM experiments, HgH, HgF, and TeO∗, are yet discussed and the experiment on PbF is planned

in Oklahoma, USA.

In order to interpret the data measured in such molecular experiments in terms of the electron EDM or other

fundamental constants of P- and P,T-odd interactions, high-precision calculation of the electronic wave function near
a heavy nucleus is required. Moreover, ab initio calculations of some molecular properties are usually required already
prior to the stage of preparation of the experimental setup.

Heavy-atom molecules, computational strategies. The most straightforward way for calculation of electronic struc-

ture of molecules containing heavy atoms is solution of the eigenvalue problem using the Dirac-Coulomb or Dirac-

Coulomb-Breit Hamiltonian [24, 25, 26] when some approximation for the four-component wave function is chosen.

However, even applying the relativistic SCF approximation to heavy-atom molecules when solving the Dirac-Fock

or Dirac-Fock-Breit equations followed by the transformation of the two-electron integrals is not always an easy

task because much larger sets of primitive basis functions are required [27, 28] for such all-electron four-component

calculations as compared to the nonrelativistic case. Starting from the Pauli approximation and Foldy & Wouthuysen

transformation, many diﬀerent two-component approaches were developed in which only large components are treated

explicitly (e.g., see [29, 30, 31, 32] and references).

The most computational savings are yet achieved when the two-component relativistic eﬀective core potential
(RECP) approximation proposed by Lee et al. [33] is used [34, 35]. There are the following reasons for it. The RECP
approach allows one to exclude large number of chemically inactive electrons from molecular calculations and to treat

explicitly the valence electrons only. Then, the oscillations of the valence spinors are usually smoothed in heavy-atom

3

cores. As a result, the number of primitive basis functions can be reduced dramatically. This approach is based on a

well-developed nonrelativistic technique of calculations, however, an eﬀective spin-orbit interaction and other scalar-

relativistic eﬀects are taken into account usually by means of radially-local or separable potentials [34, 36]. Many

complications of the Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) molecular calculations [37] are avoided when employing RECPs. The

radially-local RECP approaches for “shape-consistent” (or “norm-conserving”) pseudoorbitals are the most widely

applied in calculations of molecules with heavy elements though “energy-adjusted/consistent” pseudopotentials [35] by
Stuttgart team and Huzinaga-type “ab initio model potentials” [38] are also actively used. (In plane wave calculations
of many-atomic systems and in molecular dynamics, the separable pseudopotentials [36, 39, 40, 41, 42] are more

popular now because they provide linear scaling of computational eﬀort on the basis set size.) The nonrelativistic

shape-consistent eﬀective core potential has been ﬁrst proposed by Durand & Barthelat [43] and then a modiﬁed
scheme of the pseudoorbital constructing was suggested by Christiansen et al. [44] and by Hamann et al. [45].

However, inaccuracy of the conventional radially-local RECP approaches reaches 1000–3000 cm−1 for the transition

structure of molecules containing, in particular, transition metals, lanthanides, actinides, and superheavy elements

the conventional radially-local RECP approaches can not provide reliable results for a wide variety of properties (as

it was shown both in many calculations and theoretically, see [46, 47] and references) though otherwise is sometime

stated (e.g., see [48, 49]). Such problems can be eﬃciently overcomed by applying the generalized RECP (GRECP)

approach [46, 47, 50, 51, 52], that involves both radially-local, separable and Huzinaga-type [38, 53, 54] potentials as

its components and as particular cases. In the GRECP concept, the inner core, outer core and valence electrons are

ﬁrst treated employing diﬀerent approximations for each.

Nevertheless, calculation of such properties as electronic densities near nuclei, hyperﬁne structure constants, P,T-

parity nonconservation eﬀects, chemical and isotopic shifts etc. with the help of the two-component pseudospinors

smoothed in cores is impossible. For evaluation the matrix elements of the operators singular on nuclei, proper shapes

of the valence molecular four-component spinors must be restored in atomic core regions after the RECP calculation

of that molecule performed.

In 1959, a nonrelativistic procedure of restoration of the orbitals from smoothed Phillips–Kleinman pseudoorbitals

was proposed [55] based on the orthogonalization of the latters to the original atomic core orbitals. In 1985, Pacios

& Christiansen [56] suggested a modiﬁed orthogonalization scheme in the case of shape-consistent pseudospinors.

At the same time, a simple procedure of one-center restoration employing the idea of generation of equivalent basis

sets in four-component Dirac-Fock and two-component RECP/SCF calculations was proposed in [21] (i.e. NOCR

procedure, see below) and ﬁrst applied to evaluation of the P,T-odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters in the

PbF molecule.

In 1994, similar procedure was used by Bl¨ochl inside the augmentation regions [57] in solids to

construct the transformation operator between pseudoorbitals (“PS”) and original orbitals (“AE”) in his projector

augmented-wave method.

All the above restoration schemes can be called by “nonvariational” as compared to the “variational” one-center

restoration (VOCR, see below) procedure proposed in [58, 59]. Proper behavior of the molecular orbitals (four-

component spinors in the relativistic case) in atomic cores of molecules can be restored in the scope of a variational

procedure if the molecular pseudoorbitals (two-component pseudospinors) match correctly the original orbitals (large

components of bispinors) in the valence region after the molecular RECP calculation. This condition is rather correct

when the shape-consistent RECP is involved to the molecular calculation with explicitly treated outermost core

orbitals and, especially, when the GRECP operator is used as is demonstrated in [46].

At the restoration stage, a one-center expansion on the spherical harmonics with numerical radial parts is most

appropriate both for orbitals (spinors) and for the description of “external” interactions with respect to the core regions

4

of a considered molecule. In the scope of the discussed two-step methods of the electronic structure calculation of

a molecule, ﬁnite nucleus models and quantum electrodynamic terms including, in particular, two-electron Breit

interaction [51] may be used without problems.

One-center expansion had been applied ﬁrst to whole molecules by Desclaux & Pyykk¨o in relativistic and nonrel-

ativistic Hartree-Fock calculations for the series CH4 to PbH4 [60] and then in the Dirac-Fock calculations of CuH,
AgH and AuH [61] and other molecules [62]. A large bond length contraction due to the relativistic eﬀects has been

estimated. However, the accuracy of such calculations is limited in practice because the orbitals of the hydrogen atom

are reexpanded on a heavy nucleus in all the coordinate space. It is worth to note that the RECP and one-center

expansion approaches were considered earlier as alternatives to each other [63, 64].

The applicability of the proposed two-step algorithms for calculation of wave functions of molecules with heavy atoms

is a consequence of the fact that the valence and core electrons may be considered as two subsystems, interaction

between which is described mainly by some integrated and not by detailed properties of these subsystems. The

methods for consequent calculation of the valence and core parts of electronic structure of molecules give us a way to

combine relative simplicity and accessibility of both molecular RECP calculations in gaussian basis set and relativistic

ﬁnite-diﬀerence one-center calculations inside a sphere with the atomic core radius.

The ﬁrst two-step calculations of the P,T-odd spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters were performed for the PbF

radical about 20 years ago [21, 65] with the semiempirical accounting for the spin-orbit interaction. Before, only

nonrelativistic SCF calculation of the TlF molecule using the relativistic scaling was carried out [66, 67], in which

the P,T-odd values were almost three times underestimated as compared to the relativistic DF calculations. The
latter were ﬁrst performed only in 1997 by Laerdahl et al. [68] and by Parpia [69]. The next two-step calculation, for
PbF and HgF molecules [70], was carried out with the spin-orbit RECP part taken into account using the method

suggested in [71].

Later we performed correlation GRECP/NOCR calculations of the core properties in YbF [72], BaF [73], again in

YbF [74] and in TlF [14]. In 1998, ﬁrst all-electron Dirac-Fock calculations of the YbF molecule were also performed
by Quiney et al. [75] and by Parpia [76]. Very recently we ﬁnished extensive two-step calculations of the P,T-odd
properties and hyperﬁne structure of the excited states of the PbO molecule [77, 78].

In the paper, the main features of the used two-step method are presented and only the last series of the two-

step calculations are discussed, in which electron correlations are taken into account by a combined method of the

second-order perturbation theory (PT2) and conﬁguration interaction (CI), or “PT2/CI” [79] (for BaF and YbF), by

the relativistic coupled cluster (RCC) method [80, 81] (for TlF and PbO), and by the spin-orbit direct-CI method
[82, 83, 84] (for PbO). In the discussed ab initio calculations the best up to-date accuracy was attained for the
hyperﬁne constants and P,T-odd parameters regarding the molecules containing heavy atoms.

I. GENERALIZED RELATIVISTIC EFFECTIVE CORE POTENTIAL METHOD.

When core electrons of a heavy-atom molecule do not play an active role, the eﬀective Hamiltonian with RECP

can be presented in the form

Hamiltonian (1) is written only for a valence subspace of electrons which are treated explicitly and denoted by indices

iv and jv. In practice, this subspace is often extended by inclusion of some outermost core shells for better accuracy
but we will consider them as the valence shells below if these outermost core and valence shells are not treated

5

(2)

(3)

using diﬀerent approximations. UEf is an RECP (or relativistic pseudopotential) operator that is usually written
in the separable (e.g., see [36] and references) or radially-local (semi-local) [34] approximations when the valence

pseudospinors are smoothed in the heavy-atom cores. The RECP operator simulates, in particular, interactions of the

explicitly treated electrons with those which are excluded from the RECP calculations. Besides, the generalized RECP

operator [46, 50] described below can be used that includes the radially-local, separable and Huzinaga-type relativistic

pseudopotentials as special cases. Additionally, the GRECP operator can include terms of other types which are

important ﬁrst of all for economical but precise treatment of transition metals, lanthanides and actinides. With

these terms, accuracy provided by GRECPs can be even higher than the accuracy of the frozen core approximation
employing the same separation on subspaces of valence and core electrons [46, 47]. In Eq. (1), hSchr is the one-electron

where Zic is the charge of the nucleus decreased by the number of inner core electrons. Contrary to the four-component
wave function used in Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) calculations, the pseudo-wave function in the (G)RECP case can be both

two- and one-component. The use of the eﬀective Hamiltonian (1) instead of the all-electron relativistic Hamiltonians

leads to the question about its accuracy. It was shown both theoretically and in many calculations (see [46] and
references) that the usual accuracy of the radially-local RECP versions is within 1000–3000 cm−1 for transition

energies between low-lying states.

The GRECP concept is introduced and developed in a series of papers (see [46, 50, 52] and references). In contrast

to other RECP methods, GRECP employs the idea of separating the space around a heavy atom into three regions:

inner core, outer core and valence, which are treated diﬀerently.

It allows one to attain practically any desired

accuracy, while requiring moderate computational eﬀorts.

The main steps of the scheme of generating the GRECP version with the separable correction taken into account

are:

1. The numerical all-electron relativistic calculation of a generator state is carried out for an atom under consideration.

For this purpose, we use the atomic hfdb code [85, 86].

2. The numerical pseudospinors ˜fnlj(r) are constructed of the large components fnlj(r) of the outer core (OC) and
valence (V) HFD(B) spinors so that the innermost pseudospinors of them (for each l and j) are nodeless, the next

pseudospinors have one node, and so forth. These pseudospinors satisfy the following conditions:

where nv, noc, n′
oc are principal quantum numbers of the valence and outer core spinors, L is one more than the
highest orbital angular momentum of the inner core (IC) spinors. The leading power γ in the polynomial is typically

chosen to be close to L+1 in order to ensure suﬃcient ejection of the valence and outer core electrons from the inner

core region. The ai coeﬃcients are determined by the following requirements:

• {

y is a smooth and nodeless function, and

˜fnlj ensures a suﬃciently smooth shape of the corresponding potential.

•

•

Rc is chosen near the extremum of the spinor so that the corresponding pseudospinor has the deﬁned above number
of nodes. In practice, the Rc radii for the diﬀerent spinors should be chosen close to each other to generate smooth
potentials.

Two of the major features of the GRECP version with the separable correction described here are generating of

the eﬀective potential components for the pseudospinors which may have nodes, and addition of non-local separable

terms with projectors on the outer core pseudospinors (the second and third lines in Eq. (5)) to the standard semi-

local RECP operator (the ﬁrst line in Eq. (5)). Some other GRECP versions are described and discussed in papers

[46, 47, 50, 52] in details.

The GRECP operator in spinor representation (5) is mainly used in our atomic calculations. The spin-orbit

representation of this operator which can be found in [46] is more eﬃcient in practice being applied to molecular

calculations. Despite the complexity of expression (5) for the GRECP operator, the calculation of its one-electron

integrals is not notably more expensive than that for the case of the conventional radially-local RECP operator.

II. NONVARIATIONAL ONE-CENTER RESTORATION METHOD

The electronic density evaluated from the two-component pseudo-wave function (that, in turn, is obtained in

the (G)RECP calculation accounting for correlation) very accurately reproduces the corresponding all-electron four-

component density in the valence and outer core regions. In the inner core region, the pseudospinors are smoothed,

so that the electronic density with the pseudo-wave function is not correct. When operators describing properties of

interest are heavily concentrated near the nucleus, their mean values are strongly aﬀected by the wave function in the

inner region. The four-component molecular spinors must, therefore, be restored in the heavy-atom cores.

All molecular spinors φp can be restored as one-center expansions in the cores using the nonvariational one-center

restoration (NOCR) scheme [21, 65, 70, 72, 73, 74, 14, 77, 78] that consists of the following steps:

Generation of equivalent basis sets of one-center four-component spinors

and of smoothed

two-component pseudospinors ˜fnlj(r)χljm in ﬁnite-diﬀerence all-electron Dirac-Fock(-Breit) and GRECP/SCF cal-
culations of the same conﬁgurations of a considered atom and its ions. The nucleus is usually modeled as a uni-

form charge distribution within a sphere. The all-electron four-component hfdb [85, 86, 87] and two-component

grecp/hfj [88, 89] codes are employed by us to generate two equivalent numerical basis sets used at the restora-

tion. These sets, describing mainly the atomic core region, are generated independently of the basis set used for the

fnlj(r)χljm

molecular GRECP calculations.

The molecular pseudospinorbitals are then expanded in the basis set of one-center two-component atomic pseu-

dospinors (for r

Rnocr, where Rnocr is the radius of restoration that should be suﬃciently large for calculating core

properties with required accuracy),

where x denotes spatial and spin variables. Note that for linear molecules only one value of m survives in the sum
for each φp.

Finally, the atomic two-component pseudospinors in the molecular basis are replaced by equivalent four-component

spinors and the expansion coeﬃcients from Eq. (6) are preserved:

The molecular four-component spinors constructed this way are orthogonal to the inner core spinors of the heavy

atom, because the atomic basis functions used in Eq. (7) are generated with the inner core electrons treated as frozen.

III. VARIATIONAL ONE-CENTER RESTORATION

In the variational technique of the one-center restoration (VOCR) [58, 59], the proper behavior of the four-

component molecular spinors in the core regions of heavy atoms can be restored as an expansion on the spherical

harmonics inside the sphere with a restoration radius, Rvocr, that should not be smaller than the matching radius,
Rc, used at the RECP generation. The outer parts of spinors are treated as frozen after the RECP calculation of a
considered molecule. This method enables one to combine the advantages of two well-developed approaches, molecular

8

RECP calculation on gaussian basis set and atomic-type one-center calculation on numerical basis functions, by the

most optimal way. It is considered theoretically in [59] and some results concerning the eﬃciency of the one-center

reexpansion of orbitals on another atom can be found in [47].

The VOCR scheme can be used for constructing the core parts of the molecular spinors (orbitals) instead of using

equivalent basis sets as is in the NOCR technique. Some disadvantage of the NOCR scheme is that molecular

pseudoorbitals are usually computed in a spin-averaged GRECP/SCF molecular calculation (i.e. without accounting

for the eﬀective spin-orbit interaction) and the reexpansion of molecular pseudospinorbitals on one-center atomic

pseudospinors is yet restricted by accuracy, as it was seen in our GRECP/RCC/NOCR calculations [14] of the TlF

molecule (see below). With the restored molecular bispinors, the two-electron integrals on molecular bispinors can

be easily calculated when following the scheme presented in Eqs. (9)–(12) of the next section (see [59] for more

details). Thus, the four-component transfomation from the atomic basis that is now the most time-consuming stage

of four-component calculations of heavy-atom molecules can be avoided.

However, the most interesting direction in development of the two-step method is the possibility to “split” the

correlation structure calculation of a molecule on two consequent correlation calculations: ﬁrst, in the valence region,

when the outer core and valence electrons are explicitly involved into the GRECP calculation, and then, in the core

region, when the outer and inner core space regions are only treated at the restoration stage. Correlation eﬀects in

the valence and outer core regions (not only valence parts of molecular orbitals but also conﬁguration coeﬃcients)

can be calculated, for example, by the GRECP/RCC method with very high accuracy. Then correlation eﬀects in

the inner and outer core regions can be taken into account using the Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) Hamiltonian and the

one-center expansion. Increasing the one-center restoration radius Rvocr one can take into account correlation eﬀects
in the intermediate region (outer core in our case) with the required accuracy. Roughly speaking, the computational

eﬀorts for the correlation structure calculations in the core and valence regions are added when using the two-step

approach, whereas in the conventional one-step scheme, they have multiplicative nature.

IV. TWO-STEP CALCULATION OF MOLECULAR PROPERTIES.

the “correlated” GRECP (see [52]), in which the same correlations with the excluded core electrons are taken into

account at the GRECP generation as they are in constructing

The mean values of the majority of operators for the valence properties can be calculated with good accuracy

The last three terms in Eq. (13) account for the P- and P,T-odd eﬀects: the ﬁrst of them describes the electromag-
netic interaction of the electron with the anapole moment of the nucleus with the constant kA [94]; the second term
accounts for the scalar P,T-odd electron-nucleon interaction characterized by the dimensionless constant kS; the third

The constant 1
2 Wd characterizes an eﬀective electric ﬁeld on the unpaired electron. All the P- and P,T-odd constants
WX depend on the electron spin density in the vicinity of the heavy nucleus. The reliability of their calculation can
be tested by comparison of the calculated and experimental values for the hyperﬁne constants A and Ad.

Details of calculations. Let us consider the scheme of calculation for the above molecules on example of the YbF

calculation carried out mainly in paper [74]. The stage of the GRECP calculation of the valence structure for the
ground state 2Σ of YbF was performed by analogy with the previous YbF calculation [72]. The main diﬀerence from

the latter was the use of technique [46, 84] for freezing the 5s and 5p pseudospinors derived from the calculation
on the Yb2+ cation. It was necessary to freeze these shells because their polarization was taken into account at the

stage of calculating the eﬀective operator (EO, see [79, 95] for details). The spin-averaged GRECP calculations in

the framework of the RASSCF method [96, 97] with 5284 conﬁgurations were performed for 11 electrons distributed

in RAS-1=(2,0,0,0), RAS-2=(2,1,1,0) and RAS-3=(6,4,4,2) active orbital subspaces according to the A1, B1, B2 and
A2 irreducible representations (irreps) of the C2v symmetry group used in the calculation (see paper [96] for details
on the RASSCF method). Similar calculation was also carried out for the BaF molecule [73].

Expressions for the Wd parameter which characterizes the internal molecular ﬁeld are presented in Eqs. (15) and
(16), whereas expressions for other electronic matrix elements which correspond to the parameters A, Ad and WX
of operator (13) can be found in papers [65, 93]. All the radial integrals and atomic four-component spinors were
calculated for the ﬁnite nucleus 171Yb using a model of a uniform charge distribution within a sphere. As is mentioned
in the introduction, atomic matrix elements of operator (15) are proportional to Z 3. The same scaling is applicable to
the constant WS, while the matrix elements which contribute to the constants WA are proportional to Z 2. The nuclear
charge of ﬂuorine is eight times smaller than that of ytterbium, therefore, the contributions to the WX parameters
from the vicinity of the ﬂuorine nucleus can be neglected. The additional argument in favour of this approximation

is connected with the circumstance that the state of the unpaired electron in the YbF molecule is described mainly

by the ytterbium orbitals and thus the spin density is also localized near ytterbium.

Results. Results of the calculation for the spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters are presented in Table I. Com-

parison of the results of the GRECP/RASSCF calculations [72] with the results of the GRECP/RASSCF/EO calcu-

lations [74] conﬁrms the conclusion made in paper [72] that the core-valence correlations of the unpaired YbF electron

11

occupying mainly the hybridized 6s

6p orbital of Yb with the 5s and then with 5p shells of the Yb core (ﬁrst of all,

spin polarization of the 5s, 5p shells) contribute very essentially to the hyperﬁne and the P- and P,T-odd constants.

−

Our ﬁnal results for the hyperﬁne structure constant A diﬀer by less than 3% from the experimental value [98]. This

means that the space-isotropic part of the unpaired spin density in the vicinity of the Yb nucleus in our calculations

is obtained with rather good accuracy. However, it is also important to reproduce the anisotropic (dipole) part of the

spin density which contributes to the dipole constant Ad. The value for Ad obtained in the RASSCF/EO calculation
is in slightly better agreement with the experimental datum than the value from paper [75] but is still underestimated

by 23%. About one half of this diﬀerence can be explained by the fact that the 4f shell of Yb was frozen in our

molecular calculation (it was ﬁrst pointed out by Khriplovich that accounting for excitations from the 4f -shell can

be important). In particular, these excitations can explain the small value of the spin-doubling constant γ [99, 100].

It was shown in semiempirical calculation [95] that the contribution of the 4f -shell excitations to the spin density

can result in a signiﬁcant correction to the constant Ad. Using Eqs. (19) and (31) from paper [95], one can go to the
following estimates for the contributions from the 4f -shell excitations to A and Ad:

δA

3 MHz,

≈ −

δAd ≈

15 MHz.

(17)

Note that the semiempirical corrections obtained in [74] arise from the admixture to the molecular wavefunction of

the conﬁguration with the hole in the 4f -shell. The weight of this conﬁguration was estimated in paper [95] to be of

the order of 4%. This admixture is a purely molecular eﬀect and is not described by the eﬀective operator technique.
Thus, one can conclude that the δAd value can be added to the RASSCF/EO value for Ad, resulting in Ad ≈
94 MHz
which is essentially closer to the experimental value of 102 MHz. Note also that ab initio correlation calculation
of YbF with, at least, 4f shell treated explicitly should be performed to check the above described mechanism of

increasing the calculated Ad value. It is likely that the real situation is more complicated and indirect contributions
to Ad caused by the 4f shell correlation–relaxation eﬀects and by other higher order contributions (which are not
accounted for in the considered calculation) are mainly responsible for the obtained underestimation of Ad.

It is essential that similar contribution of the 4f -shell excitations to the constant Wd is strongly suppressed. Indeed,
operator (15) mixes f - and d-waves. The 4d-shell is localized rather deeply in the ytterbium core and its mixture

with the 4f -orbitals by the molecular ﬁeld is very small while the 5d electrons are relatively weakly-bound and does

not penetrate essentially into the region of the 4f -shell localization. Similar contributions to other constants WX are
negligible due to the contact character of the corresponding interactions.

One can see that the values of the Wd constant from the unrestricted DHF calculation (accounting for the spin-
polarization of core shells) [76], the latest semiempirical calculation [95] and the GRECP/RASSCF/NOCR/EO calcu-

lation are in very good agreement. It is also important for reliability of the carried out calculations that the contribu-

tion from the valence electron to Wd in paper [76] diﬀers only by 7.4% from the corresponding GRECP/SCF/NOCR
calculation [72] (see Table I). Another DHF calculation [75] gives a value that is about two times smaller (that is

rather explained by diﬀerent deﬁnitions used for Wd).

Similar increase in the values for the hyperﬁne constants and parameters of the P,T-odd interactions when the

correlations with the core shells (ﬁrst of all, 5s, 5p) are taken into account is also observed for the BaF molecule

[73] as one can see in Table I). Of course, the corrections on the 4f -electron excitations are not required for this

molecule. The enhancement factor for the P,T-odd eﬀects in the BaF molecule is three times smaller than in YbF

mainly because of smaller nuclear charge of Ba. Therefore, barium ﬂuoride can be considered as a less promising

molecule for a search for the PNC eﬀects.

Eﬀective Hamiltonian. Here we consider the interaction of the EDM of unpaired proton in 205Tl with the internal
electromagnetic ﬁeld of the 205TlF molecule [14]. This molecule is one of the best objects for the proton EDM

measurements. The eﬀective interaction with the proton EDM in TlF is written in the form

is measured experimentally (for the latest results on TlF see [13]).

The parameters X of Eq. (20) and M of Eq. (22) are determined by the electronic structure of the molecule. They
were calculated recently for the ground 0+ state of TlF by Parpia [69] and by Laerdahl, Saue, Faegri Jr., and Quiney

[68], using the Dirac–Fock method with gaussian basis sets of large sizes (see Table II). (Below we refer to paper [105]

with the calculations presented in details and not to the brief communication [68] of the same authors.) In paper [14]
the ﬁrst calculation of 205TlF that accounts for correlation eﬀects was performed (see also [106] where the limit on
the Schiﬀ moment of 205Tl was recalculated).

Details of calculations.

In paper [14] 21-electron GRECP [107] for Tl was used. The correlation spin-orbital basis

set consisted of 26s, 25p, 18d, 12f , and 10g gaussian-type orbitals on Tl, contracted to 6s6p4d2f 1g. The basis was

optimized in a series of atomic two-component GRECP calculations, with correlation included by the relativistic

coupled cluster method [108] with single and double cluster amplitudes; the average energy of the two lowest states

of the atom was minimized. The basis set generation procedure is described in Refs. [109, 110]. The basis set was

designed to describe correlation in the outer core 5s and 5p shells of Tl, in addition to the 5d and valence shells.

While correlating the 5s and 5p shells may not be important for a majority of chemical and physical properties of

the atom, it is essential for describing properties coming from the inner Tl region, including P,T-odd eﬀects. The

(14s9p4d3f )/[4s3p2d1f ] basis set from the ANO-L library [97] is used for ﬂuorine.

First, one-component SCF calculation of the (1σ . . . 7σ)14(1π2π3π)12(1δ)4 ground state of TlF is performed, using

the spin-averaged GRECP for Tl which simulates the interactions of the valence and outer core (5s5p5d) electrons
with the inner core [Kr]4d4
7/2. This is followed by two-component RCC calculations, with only single

5/24f 6

5/24f 8

14

(RCC-S) or with single and double (RCC-SD) cluster amplitudes. The RCC-S calculations with the spin-dependent

GRECP operator take into account eﬀects of spin-orbit interaction at the level of the one-conﬁgurational SCF-type

method. The RCC-SD calculations include, in addition, the most important electron correlation eﬀects.

At the restoration stage, the nucleus was modeled as a uniform charge distribution within a sphere with radius
10−4 a.u., whereas previous calculations [69, 105] employed a spherical gaussian nuclear charge

rnucl = 7.1 fm
distribution (the root mean square radius in all calculations is 5.5 fm, in accord with the parametrization of Johnson
and Soﬀ [111], and agrees with the experimental value 5.483 fm for the 205Tl nucleus [112]). The two equivalent

1.34

×

≡

[15s12p12d8f ] numerical basis sets were generated for the restoration.

The quality of the approximation for the two-center molecular spinors and, consequently, of the calculated properties

increases with the value of Lmax. A series of calculations of the M parameter was performed using Eq. (7) with basis
functions including up to p, d and f harmonics. It is found (see Table II) that accounting for only s and p functions

in the expansion determines M with 90% accuracy. Because the contribution of f functions is only about 0.3% and
r(j−1/2), the error due to the

amplitudes of higher harmonics on the nucleus are suppressed by the leading term

neglect of spherical harmonics beyond f is estimated to be below 0.1%. Calculation of the X parameter requires s

∼

and p harmonics (see Ref. [105]), although, strictly speaking, d harmonics also give nonzero contributions.

In the RCC calculations, the X and M parameters were calculated by the ﬁnite ﬁeld method (e.g., see Refs. [91, 92]).

The operator corresponding to a desired property (Eqs. (20) and (22)) is multiplied by a small parameter λ and added

to the Hamiltonian. The derivative of the energy with respect to λ gives the computed property. This is strictly

correct only at the limit of vanishing λ, but it is usually possible to ﬁnd a range of λ values where the energy is almost

linear with λ and energy changes are large enough to allow suﬃcient precision. The quadratic dependence on λ is

eliminated in the present calculations by averaging absolute energy changes obtained with λ of opposite signs.

Results. Calculations were carried out at two internuclear separations, the equilibrium Re = 2.0844 ˚A as in
Ref. [69], and 2.1 ˚A, for comparison with Ref. [105]. The results are collected in Table II. The ﬁrst point to
notice is the diﬀerence between spin-averaged SCF values and RCC-S values, the latter include spin-orbit interaction

eﬀects. These eﬀects increase X by 9% and decrease M by 21%. The RCC-S function can be written as a single

determinant, and results may therefore be compared with DHF values, even though the RCC-S function is not

variational. GRECP/RCC-S/NOCR values of the M parameter are indeed within 3% and 1% of diﬀerence with the

corresponding DHF values [69, 105] (Table II). This agreement conﬁrms the validity of the used approximations.

In particular, freezing the inner core shells is justiﬁed, as inner core relaxation eﬀects have little inﬂuence on the

properties calculated here, a conclusion already drawn by Quiney et al. [105].

Much larger diﬀerences occur for the X parameter. There are also large diﬀerences between the two DHF calcu-

lations for X, which cannot be explained by the small change in internuclear separation. The value of X may be

expected to be less stable than M , because it is determined by the derivative of the electronic density at the Tl

nucleus and involves large cancellations [105] between contributions of large and small components, each of them is

about 20 times larger than their sum. Thus, a strong dependence of X on the basis used may be expected. The DHF

values collected in Table II indeed show such dependence. Results obtained in Refs. [69] and [105] with comparable

even-tempered basis sets, (28s28p12d8f ) and (28s28p14d8f ), are rather close, diﬀering by 340 a.u. Improving the

Tl basis to (34s34p16d9f ) [105] increases X by 650 a.u. or 8%. Further improvement of the basis may be expected

to yield even higher X values. The numerical basis functions obtained in atomic DHF calculations and used for the

restoration are highly accurate near the nucleus, so that the GRECP/RCC-S/NOCR value for X, which is higher
than that of Quiney et al. [105], seems reasonable. The diﬀerent nuclear models used in the present and DHF [69, 105]
calculations may also contribute to the disagreement in X, which is determined by the derivative of the electronic

charge density at a single point, the Tl origin. M is aﬀected by ψ in a broader region, and is therefore far less sensitive

The electron correlation eﬀects are calculated by the RCC-SD method at the molecular equilibrium internuclear

distance Re. A major correlation contribution is observed, decreasing M by 17% and X by 22%.

The hyperﬁne structure constants of Tl 6p1

1/2 and Tl2+ 6s1, which (like X and M ) depend on operators concentrated
near the Tl nucleus, were also calculated. The errors in the DF values are 10–15%; the RCC-SD results are within

1–4% of experiment. The improvement in X and M upon inclusion of correlation is expected to be similar.

VII. CALCULATIONS OF 207PBO MOLECULE.

It was noted previously that the experiments on the excited a(1) [23] or B(1) [113] states of PbO having nonzero

projection of total electronic momentum on the internuclear axis can be, in principle, sensitive enough to detect de
three or even four orders of magnitude lower than the current limit. The knowledge of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld, Wd,
seen by an unpaired electron is required for extracting de from the measurements. In papers [77, 78], Wd for the a(1)
and B(1) states of the PbO molecule was calculated by the RCC-SD [80, 81] and CI [114, 82, 83, 84] methods. To

provide an accuracy check in calculation of the electronic structure near the Pb nucleus the hyperﬁne constant, Ak,
was also calculated.

Details of calculations. The 22-electron GRECP for Pb [107] is used at the ﬁrst stage of the two-step calculations

of PbO: the inner shells of the Pb atom (1s to 4f ) are absorbed into the GRECP, and the 5s5p5d6s6p electrons

and all the oxygen electrons are treated explicitly at the integral preparation part. Two series of RCC-SD calcu-

lations with 10 (when freezing the 5s5p5d shells of lead employing the level shift technique [46] and freezing the

1s shell of oxigen after the RASSCF stage) and all 30 electrons treated explicitly were performed. Only 10 elec-

trons were treated explicitly in the CI calculations. For each series of calculations, correlation spin-orbital basis

sets are optimized in atomic two-component GRECP/RCC calculations of Pb. The generated basis sets on Pb are

(14s18p16d8f )/[4s7p5d3f ] for 30-electron and (15s16p12d9f )/[5s7p4d2f ] for 10-electron calculations. The correlation-

consistent (10s5p2d1f )/[4s3p2d1f ] basis listed in the MOLCAS 4.1 library [97] is used for oxygen. We found that

the f basis function of oxygen has little eﬀect on the core properties calculated here and it was not included into the

RCC calculations to reduce expenses.

The leading ΛΣ coupling terms and conﬁgurations for the a(1) and B(1) states are 3Σ+ σ2
2σ1

2 and 3Π1

RASSCF method [96, 97] with the spin-averaged GRECP part [46], i.e. only scalar-relativistic interactions are taken

into account in the RASSCF calculation. The a(1) state is of practical interest ﬁrst of all and, therefore, the lowest
3Σ+ state was calculated at this stage. Using the C2v point group classiﬁcation scheme, two A1 orbitals are in RAS1,
six orbitals (two A1, two B1, and two B2) in RAS2, and 50 (20 A1, 6 A2, 12 B1, and 12 B2) in RAS3 for 10-electron
calculation. 2 A1 orbitals are in RAS1, 6 orbitals (2 A1, 2 B1, and 2 B2) in RAS2, and 41 (16 A1, 5 A2, 10 B1, and
10 B2) in RAS3 for 30-electron calculation. No more than two holes in RAS1 and two particles in RAS3 are allowed.
At the restoration stage the nucleus is modeled by a uniform charge distribution within a sphere of radius rnucl =
10−4 a.u. The root mean square radius of the nucleus is 5.52 fm, in accord with the parametrization
7.12 fm = 1.35
of Johnson and Soﬀ [111], and agrees with the experimental value of 5.497 fm [112] for the 207Pb nucleus. Taking this

×

value for the root mean square radius and a Fermi distribution for the nuclear charge changes Ak and Wd by 0.1% or
less. The equivalent basis sets generated are [9s14p7d] for 10 and [6s7p5d] for 30-electron calculation correspondingly.

Then the RCC-SD method and the spin-orbit CI approach with the selected single- and double-excitations from

some multiconﬁgurational reference states (“mains”) [84, 114] are employed in the sets of diﬀerent ΛS many-electron

spin- and space-symmetry adapted basis functions

Results. CI calculations [78] were performed at two internuclear distances, R = 3.8 a.u., as is in RCC calculations,

and R = 4.0 a.u. (in the RCC calculations [77] the only internuclear distance R = 3.8 a.u. was used because of problem

with convergence at larger distances). The calculated values with the one-center expansion of the molecular spinors

in the Pb core on either s, s; p or s; p; d partial waves are collected in Table III.

Let us consider the 5s, 5p, 5d orbitals of lead and 1s orbital of oxigen as the outercore ones and σ1, σ2, σ3, π1,
π2 orbitals of the PbO (consisting mainly of 6s, 6p orbitals of Pb and 2s, 2p orbitals of O) as valence. Although in
the CI calculations we take into account only the correlation between valence electrons, the accuracy attained in the

CI calculation of Ak is much better than in the RCC-SD calculation. The main problem with the RCC calculation
was that the used Fock-space RCC-SD version was not optimal in accounting for the nondynamic correlations (see

[109] for details of RCC-SD and CI calculations of the Pb atom), though the potential of the RCC approach for

electronic structure calculations is very high in prospect, especially, in the framework of the intermediate Hamiltonian

formulation [81].

Then we estimate the contribution from correlations of valence electrons with outercore ones (which also account

for correlations between outercore pairs of electrons) as diﬀerence in the results of the corresponding 10- and 30-

electron GRECP/RCC calculations (see also [109] where this correction is applied to the Pb atom). We designate

such correlations in Table III as “outercore correlations”. When taking into account outercore contributions at the

point R = 4.0 a.u. we used the results of the RCC calculation at the point R = 3.8 a.u. Since these contributions

are relatively small and because the correlations with the outercore electrons are more stable than correlations in the

valence region when the internuclear distance is changed the used approximation seems us reasonable. At last, the

linear extrapolation of the results of calculations to the experimental equilibrium distances, Re = 4.06 a.u. for a(1)
3826 MHz, Wd =
[115] and Re = 3.91 a.u. for B(1) [116] is applied. The ﬁnal results are: Ak =
cm)
for a(1) and Ak = 4887 MHz, Wd =
cm) for B(1) states. The estimated error for the ﬁnal Wd
parameter is 20% for B(1) state. For a(1) the estimated error bounds put the actual Wd value between 90% and
130% of the ﬁnal value (for details see [78]).

aIt is assumed that the outercore contribution at the internuclear distance R=4.0 a.u. is approximately the same as is at R=3.8 a.u.

The P,T-parity nonconservation parameters and hyperﬁne constants are calculated for the heavy-atom molecules

which are of primary interest for modern experiments on search for the PNC eﬀects. It is found that accounting for the

electron correlations is necessary for precise calculation of these properties. The developed two-step (GRECP/NOCR)

scheme of calculation of the properties heavily concentrated in atomic cores is a very eﬃcient way to take account of

these correlations with moderate eﬀorts. The results of the two-step calculations for the hyperﬁne constants diﬀer less

than 10% from the corresponding experimental data. The comparable level of accuracy is expected for the P,T-odd

spin-rotational Hamiltonian parameters which can not be obtained experimentally. The precision of the discussed

calculations is limited by the current possibilities of the correlation methods and codes and not by the GRECP

and NOCR approximations, despite the GRECP/NOCR method allows one to reduce seriously the expenses of the

correlation treatment as compared to conventional Dirac-Coulomb(-Breit) approaches when using basis of molecular

spin-orbitals instead of spinors etc. In turn, the attained accuracy is suﬃcient for a reliable interpretation of the

results measured in the molecular PNC experiments.

Prospects for Forbidden-Transition Spectroscopy and Parity Violation Measurements
using a Beam of Cold Stable or Radioactive Atoms

(February 28 2003)

Laser cooling and trapping oﬀers the possibility of conﬁning a sample of radioactive atoms in
free space. Here, we address the question of how best to take advantage of cold atom properties
to perform the observation of as highly forbidden a line as the 6S-7S Cs transition for achieving,
in the longer term, Atomic Parity Violation measurements in radioactive alkali isotopes. Another
point at issue is whether one might do better with stable, cold atoms than with thermal atoms.
To compensate for the large drawback of the small number of atoms available in a trap, one must
take advantage of their low velocity. To lengthen the time of interaction with the excitation laser,
we suggest choosing a geometry where the laser beam exciting the transition is colinear to a slow,
cold atomic beam, either extracted from a trap or prepared by Zeeman slowing. We also suggest a
new observable physical quantity manifesting APV, which presents several advantages: speciﬁcity,
eﬃciency of detection, possibility of direct calibration by a parity conserving quantity of a similar
nature. It is well adapted to a conﬁguration where the cold atomic beam passes through two regions
of transverse, crossed electric ﬁelds, leading both to diﬀerential measurements and to strong reduc-
tion of the contributions from the M1-Stark interference signals, potential sources of systematics in
APV measurements. Our evaluation of signal to noise ratios shows that with available techniques,
measurements of transition amplitudes, important as required tests of Atomic Theory should be
possible in 133Cs with a statistical precision of 10−3 and probably also in Fr isotopes for production
−1. For APV measurements to become realistic, some practical realization

I. INTRODUCTION : MOTIVATIONS

Atomic Parity Violation (APV) measurements have proved successful for probing at low energy one of the most
fundamental predictions of the Standard Model (SM), namely the existence of a weak electron-nucleus interaction
mediated by the exchange of neutral gauge bosons Z0 [1–3]. Up to now the eﬀorts have been focused on the comparison
between the experimental determination of the weak charge of the atomic nucleus, QW , and its SM prediction at the
0.5% level of precision, the cesium atom lending itself to the most precise comparison [4–6]. Actually, it looks
somewhat too early to assert deﬁnitely either the absence or existence of a deviation, most likely less than 2.5 σ [6,7].
On the other hand, it has not been possible, yet, to test another important SM prediction concerning the variation
of QW along a string of isotopes belonging to the same element. An original experimental approach is currently
pursued for rare-earth elements namely Yb [8] and Dy [9], but it also would be extremely valuable to extend the
measurements which have proved successful for natural cesium, 133Cs (the sole stable Cs isotope), to a few of its
numerous radioactive isotopes, as well as to other alkali isotopes, more excitingly radioactive francium. With Z=87,
francium is expected to lead, due to the fast increase with Z [1], to APV eﬀects 18 times larger than cesium, while it
does not look unrealistic to have a theoretical prediction of its weak charge as precise as that for cesium [10]. Indeed,
atomic structure calculations for alkali are (barring H and He) the most precise available. This, added to the fact
that many isotopes can be produced, makes this element often considered as one of the most interesting candidates
for forthcoming experiments. Moreover, since up to now, the nuclear anapole moment [11] has been detected only for
133Cs [2] (an even neutron-number isotope), it is important to measure it for another isotope (preferably one with an
odd neutron-number). Regardless of APV, measurements on the forbidden line in alkali-metal atoms are important
since forbidden magnetic dipole amplitudes are “the most sensitive among electromagnetic transition amplitudes to
the accuracy of the relativistic description of an atomic system” [12], i.e. rigorous tests of atomic theory.

Francium, and more generally short-lived radioactive atoms, either obtained from a radioactive source or produced
on line by an accelerated ion beam colliding a target, are produced at a limited rate, with a thermal, or even
superthermal, velocity distribution. In order to perform APV measurements the ﬁrst prerequisite is to avoid their
spreading out in space and their loss inside the wall. Only the radiative cooling and trapping techniques [13] possibly
combined with Light Induced Atomic Desorption (LIAD) [14] can succeed in this kind of operation. Several successful
attempts to load radioactive alkali atoms in a neutral atom trap have been reported with 21Na [15], 38Km, 37K [16],
79Rb [17], 135Cs [18], 207−211Fr [19], 221Fr [20]. Observation of several allowed Fr transitions has been realized for
atoms trapped inside a MOT, leading to precise spectroscopic measurements [21]. But never, yet, has it been reported
for a transition as highly forbidden as the Fr 7S-8S transition. Therefore, before attempting APV measurements with
cold atoms, a preliminary - and by no means straightforward - objective consists in observing the 6S-7S transition
with trapped Cs atoms. Since the precise value of the parity conserving transition amplitudes, in particular the Stark
induced amplitude associated with the vector polarizability β, is still a somewhat open question (see below), as an
assessment of the potential of trapped atoms for this kind of experiment, we suggest a new precision measurement
of the ratio M hf
induced by hyperﬁne interaction serves as a precisely
known amplitude used for calibration [22,23]. This would be all the more precious since the previous measurements
[3] were made in acrobatic conditions (background equal to 100 times the signal [3]) and have led to a result for β
which diﬀers from a recent independent semi-empirical determination by (0.7
0.4)% [24]. Though small, such a
diﬀerence is suﬃcient to narrow the gap between theoretical and experimental values of QW (Cs) from 2.2 to 0.9σ. A
measurement of M hf
1 /β in cesium will allow us to assess the feasibility of similar measurements in francium, knowing
the production rate. Finally, we also attempt to evaluate the feasibility of an even more ambitious project, namely a
new high precision measurement of the parity violating electric dipole amplitude Epv
in cesium, and hence QW (Cs)
1
by an independent method using cold atoms. Indeed, such an independent measurement would be extremely valuable
as a cross check of this fundamental quantity [25]. Beyond this, we cannot understate how welcome a measurement
of QW (Fr) would be, if some day feasible.

Our paper is a prospective work suggesting preparatory experiments for much more ambitious projects. Once a
sample of cold alkali atoms is produced at the center of a trap, there remains a still unsolved point at issue : what is
the best way to use it for exciting and probing the forbidden Cs 6S-7S transition, or the analogous 7S-8S transition
in Fr, in the Stark electric ﬁeld necessary to previous APV measurements? Even for the stable isotope 133Cs, the
biggest diﬃculty is linked to the small number of atoms available in a trap. It is the purpose of the present paper to
quantify such a diﬃculty by making comparisons with conditions realized in previous APV experiments performed
with stable, thermal atoms and to suggest an experimental approach using their diﬀerent speciﬁc properties. We
suggest advantageous means to exploit their low velocity and we also propose a new physical observable which, we
believe, is well adapted to this situation. It is shown to be well suited to the measurement of ﬁrst M hf
1 /β and later
Epv
1 . Concerning the measurement accuracy, in an approach of this kind two parameters play an essential role :
i) the number of atoms present at a given time in the interaction region, ii) the probability for such an atom to
contribute to the APV signal, which takes into account the nature of the physical observable, and both the excitation
and detection eﬃciencies. We have not found the ideal compromise between simplicity and outstanding performances,
transferable from Cs to Fr. According to the exact goal to be reached the experimental scheme to be chosen will
probably have to change. We consider three diﬀerent experimental approaches, all of them relying on the production
of a cold, slow atomic beam. They diﬀer by the method of production of the beam and its parameters. This will
appear explicitly in

II. USE OF A SLOW AND COLD ATOMIC BEAM EXCITED BY A COLINEAR LASER BEAM

The energy levels and wavelengths relevant to APV measurements and to laser trapping operation for both cesium
and francium are shown on Fig. 1. A precise value of the measured energy diﬀerence between the Fr 8S1/2 and
7S1/2 levels is given in [26]. Performing the PV measurements inside an optical molasses or a Magneto Optical Trap
(MOT), precisely where the atoms are cooled and stored presents some inconvenience. Indeed, both laser cooling
for instance, the presence of
and APV measurements require speciﬁc conditions which look diﬃcult to reconcile :
excited atomic species in the interaction region and the interception of the wide cooling light beams by the necessary
electrodes are both diﬃcult to avoid. Among a large variety of techniques available for manipulating atomic velocities

by electromagnetic forces [27], several of them oﬀer the possibility of producing a well collimated beam of slow, cold
atoms. In order to concentrate the discussion on a well deﬁned situation, we shall choose the example of a pyramidal
MOT built according to the judicious and simple suggestion of Lee et al. [28], now used by several groups [29,30]. The
trap is built with four mirrors, standing as the four faces of an inverted pyramid. A single cooling beam, circularly
polarized, is enough to create, after reﬂexion on the four mirrors, the same ﬁeld conﬁguration as a standard six-beam
MOT. When the pyramidal trap is vapor-loaded, a beam of slow and cold atoms escapes continuously through the
hole bored through the pyramid apex because of local imbalance of intensities. In typical conditions this kind of
device can provide a continuous ﬂux Φat of >
109 cesium atoms/s with a mean velocity v tunable around 10 m/s
∼
and a velocity spread less than 1.5 m/s [30]. The transverse velocity spread of the beam is found to lie close to the
Doppler transverse limit for cesium

¯hΓ/m = 0.13 m/s.

(⋆) Cs 7S state lifetime from experiment [31], and (⋆⋆) Fr 8S state lifetime from theory [32].

The pyramidal trap has advantages of low cost and simplicity, but still better performances can be achieved with
more sophisticated devices. In particular, ref. [33,34] describes how an even slower and colder rubidium beam can
be obtained using a vapor loaded laser trap which ensures two-dimensional magneto-optical trapping, as well as
longitudinal cooling by a moving molasses (MM-MOT). The average velocity can be as low as 1m/s and the velocity
distribution has been evaluated: ∆v/v < 1/10. When either one of those slow atomic beams is illuminated by a co-
or counter-propagating narrow line-width cw laser beam, the dispersion of the longitudinal velocities is small enough
for all atoms excited on the 6S-7S transition to belong to a single velocity class. Moreover, at optimum alignment,
the divergence of the atomic beam (26 mrd FWHM) going out of the pyramidal trap is small enough for avoiding
any signiﬁcant atom loss out of a 1 mm radius laser beam over an interaction length of 4 cm. In contrast, the larger
divergence of the ultra cold beam [34] unavoidably complicates the design of the experiment (see proposal 2,
V B).
Other 2D-MOT, among those delivering larger atomic ﬂuxes [35–37], have, for the present application, the drawback of
either a larger divergence or a larger velocity spread. On the other hand, the features needed here, high ﬂux, moderate
velocity and low divergence are met by other techniques, namely Zeeman slowing. In particular, the Zeeman-slower
apparatus described in ref [38] has very attractive features : ﬂux of Cs atoms exceeding 1010 s−1, very small spread
1 m/s and much better collimation (divergence angle less than 1 mrd). This gives the
of longitudinal velocities,
possibility of lengthening the interaction region (see proposal 3 in Table I and
V C). Although some adaptation
will be necessary to make the system work with radioactive isotopes, depending on their method of production, it is
interesting to evaluate its potentiality as compared to that of a thermal atomic beam or a vapor cell.

After a short path beyond the trap exit (or the collimation module [38]), the atomic beam enters the interaction
region which includes capacitor plates generating the Stark ﬁeld, with the plane electrodes parallel to the beam
direction. The ﬁrst relevant parameter to be compared here to previous experimental conﬁgurations is the number of
atoms Nat interacting with the excitation laser beam in the interaction region of length l.

For an atomic beam experiment Nat = Φat ×

l/v. For a vapor at thermal equilibrium (Paris experiment [40]) we
take into account that only a fraction of the atoms can absorb the resonant light beam which has a spectral width
much smaller than the Doppler width. By averaging the velocity-dependent transition probability over the thermal
distribution, one ﬁnds that this can be accounted for by the reduction factor : R = √2πΓ/4ΓD (see ref. [41]), where

Table I collects the value of this important parameter Nat expected in the present proposals, for comparison with
those obtained in the experiment having previously yielded APV data in Cs. It clearly appears that the eﬀect of the
much larger atomic ﬂux available with the thermal beam used by the Boulder group [2,42] is counterbalanced by the
much shorter interaction time resulting from a
50 times shorter
to ensure transverse excitation of the beam. By comparison, the vapor experiment developed in Paris takes complete
advantage of having at one’s disposal a number of atoms in the interaction region up to tens thousands times larger.
The thermal beam experiment compensates for this deﬁcit by use of a huge laser power in the interaction region
105. From the point of view of systematics each approach has its
owing to a Fabry-Perot cavity with a ﬁnesse of
advantages and its drawbacks.

Cold atomic beams of several kinds have been described in the literature. Since our purpose is to assess how well
each one is adapted to performing APV measurements, with comparison in view, we introduce a quality factor aiming
at taking into account the divergence of the atomic beam, ∆v⊥
v , the main limitation to measurement eﬃciency. We
ﬁrst deﬁne the optimum length of interaction lopt, as the length over which the atomic beam radius r, does not exceed
1mm, a reasonable value for a laser beam radius 1. For proposals 1, 2 and 3, we obtain lopt = 4 cm, 1.5 cm and 60
cm respectively 2. Then, the quality factor is deﬁned as the number of atoms in the interaction region of length lopt,
namely fAP V = Φat ×

lopt/v.

[38] (Cs), Lu et al. [39] (Rb).

On Figure 2 we plot the quality factor versus the velocity for several beams of cold stable atoms chosen among
those having a small spread of longitudinal velocities. The existing designs present themselves as grouped into
three categories : the ultra-cold beams using a moving molasses [33,34], the cold beams extracted from a 2D-MOT
[30,35,36,39] and the Zeeman-slowed device using a collimator [38]. In view of optimizing APV measurements on
stable atoms, this last device is expected to lead to the best results, although the pyramidal trap remains of real
interest due to its simplicity and probably better adaptability to radioactive isotopes. As we noted previously, the
performances expected with the cold atomic beams are limited essentially by their divergence. However one may
imagine two means of palliating this kind of diﬃculty.

i) Multiple passages of the excitation beam : it looks possible to widen the interaction region, at ﬁxed density of
excitation energy, by performing forward-backward passages of the beam between two spherical mirrors. The two
mirrors should be pierced, one for providing the passage of the atomic beam at the output of the MOT and the other
the passage of the counterpropagating excitation laser [43].

ii)Insertion of a collimator at the output of the MOT : It would seem very interesting to insert at the output of a
two dimensional MOT a collimator similar to that described in [38]. Besides the beam collimation this device has the
attractive feature of deﬂecting the atomic beam by a small angle, thus making possible to place the interaction region
inside a Fabry-Perot cavity which provides enhancement of the excitation energy density. However we must be aware
that a transverse temperature at the output of the collimator less than 50 µK looks diﬃcult to achieve. Therefore
the divergence of the slow beam remains well above that of the faster Zeeman-slowed beam.

III. A WELL ADAPTED OBSERVABLE PHYSICAL QUANTITY AND TWO INTERACTION REGIONS

The choice of the observable physical quantity which manifests APV also plays an important role, since it determines
the speciﬁc nature of the signal (absence or presence of a background), its signature and it also conditions the detection
eﬃciency. In our ﬁrst experiment in Paris [44], as well as in our current second-generation one [40], we have chosen to
detect an angular momentum anisotropy in the excited state (either an atomic orientation in the ﬁrst version, or an
atomic alignment in the latter) providing a very speciﬁc signal without background. However, ﬂuorescence detection
10−3), due to the need of polarization analysis on a single ﬁne structure
eﬃciency of the 7S state orientation was low (
line. Alignment detection can be conducted eﬃciently using stimulated emission detection [40,45]. However, in view
of the very small number of atoms available in a trap, there is no possibility of signal ampliﬁcation by the stimulated
emission process advantageously used in a dense vapor. Therefore, with a cold beam there is a strong incentive for
detecting the PV eﬀect on the absorption rate.

We suggest to create a spin polarization ~Pe of the atomic beam at the output of the trap in a direction perpendicular
to its velocity. Then, a specially well adapted observable physical quantity is a contribution to the absorption rate
involving this spin polarization. It results from an interference between the parity-violating electric dipole amplitude

atoms performed in a preparation region and use a transverse Stark electric ﬁeld ~E in the interaction region. Both make use
of a circularly polarized excitation beam (helicity ξ). With the thermal beam, the excitation beam has to be transverse to the
velocity and the magnetic ﬁeld ~B, large enough to resolve the Zeeman components, has to rotate its direction by π/2 between
the preparation and interaction regions, while with the cold beam the excitation can be longitudinal and only a small magnetic
ﬁeld ~b, of uniform direction, is required, to preserve the spin polarization between the two regions. The pseudoscalar ~E · ξˆk ∧ ~B

angular momentum of the light beam which excites the transition and ~E is the applied static electric ﬁeld. It has
the advantage of appearing in the total population of the excited state. It can be detected by monitoring the total
intensity of the ﬂuorescence light emitted during the two-step desexcitation process, involving either the 6P1/2 or
the 6P3/2 state. No polarization analysis nor even light ﬁltering (except for stray light) is necessary in principle.
The APV signal is odd under the separate reversals of the electric ﬁeld, the spin polarization and the helicity of
the photons which excite the transition. We relegate to the appendix the derivation of the signal expression in the
most general conditions. Here we present the result in the particular case of 133Cs (I=7/2), for the experimental

in these two regions, with the direction of ~Pe taken at
45◦ to the direction of ~E in one and the other region (See
conﬁgurations 1 and 2, or 3 and 4, represented in Fig. 4). Then, the diﬀerence of ﬂuorescence rates in those two
regions can selectively provide the ~Pe-dependent contribution of interest. In the next section, we shall show that such
a diﬀerential measurement also oﬀers the important additional advantage of suppressing some dangerous systematic
eﬀects.

Another observable physical quantity appearing in the absorption rate has been proposed in [47].

It does not
require any spin polarization of the ground state, but it involves the application of a magnetic ﬁeld ~B, transverse to
the light beam, which enters explicitly into the deﬁnition of the pseudoscalar manifesting parity violation, ~E
~B.
However, for observing this eﬀect the ﬁeld has to be large enough for the Zeeman components to be resolved, otherwise
compensations occur [48]. This is, actually, the APV eﬀect which has been detected by the Boulder group [49]. In
the most recent version of their experiment [2] (see Fig. 3-a for a schematic representation of the conﬁguration),
the atomic beam is spin polarized in a preparation zone before entering the interaction region, but a magnetic ﬁeld
(6.4 G), whose purpose is to resolve the Zeeman lines is still applied, although the atomic spin polarization prepared
in the ground state makes this unnecessary, as Eq. 1 shows. With the same set-up, a much weaker ﬁeld would be
suﬃcient for preserving the direction of the atomic orientation between the preparation and the interaction regions.
This would avoid slight line overlap of adjacent Zeeman lines and the associated diﬃculties.

We, now, want to comment about the conditions to be fulﬁlled by the magnetic ﬁeld, which obviously cannot be
perfectly cancelled. There are strict requirements: the magnetic ﬁeld of the MOT has to be screened. Instead, a
small ~B ﬁeld along the direction wanted for the spin polarization is needed in the optical pumping region as well as
in the two interaction regions and, consequently, in between those two regions: otherwise the rapid spin precession
might result in spin disorientation (when the spins do not follow adiabatically the ﬁeld direction). Finally, the exact
direction of ~Pe inside the interaction regions, involved in the pseudoscalar manifesting APV, is actually determined
by the ~b ﬁeld direction in those regions, eventhough this ﬁeld (typically 100 mG) is small enough to avoid broadening
of the transition. We note that those conditions are easier to fulﬁll than those realized in [2], since the ﬁeld direction
remains the same between the preparation and the interaction regions (see Fig. 2), instead of having to be rotated
by π/2.

ﬁeld have all met the diﬃculty associated with the presence of the parity conserving interference eﬀect, which can
mimic the PV signal if the reversal of the light helicity ξ is imperfect, i.e. if a small component of linear polarization
changes its sign simultaneously with ξ. This kind of problem occurs when the optics on the path of the excitation
beam possess some birefringence, a defect diﬃcult to avoid completely at the level required.

V. MAGNITUDE OF THE EXPECTED SIGNALS

In the preceding sections we have made precise suggestions for adapting APV measurements to a source of cold
atoms. Now, we intend to give an estimate of both the APV and the M ′
(M1),
and their Signal to Noise ratios (SNR), assuming reasonable magnitudes of the Stark ﬁeld and the laser intensity.
We note that the shot noise limited SNR is independent of the magnitude of the Stark ﬁeld. We take the example
of 133Cs in order to make easier comparison with other atomic sources already exploited. First, we need to evaluate
Φex, where Φex is the ﬂux of excitation
the excitation probability per unit of time:
photons. The excitation cross section without electric ﬁeld, σnat = σex(E = 0), without Doppler broadening, for an
isotope without nuclear spin, excited by a single-mode laser centered in frequency at the transition peak, is given in
ref [41]:

that the conditions for observing this signal could be made excellent : thanks to the very good vacuum realized by
diﬀerential pumping in the beam compartment which is well separated from the MOT by the pyramidal assembly, we
can expect nearly no background. In this respect the signature given to

We can now examine the situation with francium. As mentioned earlier we can expect the francium M ′

noise limited SNR ratio is thus increased by a factor of 10. On the other hand, the atom ﬂux will certainly be reduced.
The best production rates of Fr+ ions available in the world is, to our knowledge, at the ISOLDE facility at CERN :
109 s−1. We are presently uncertain about the eﬃciency of neutralization and collection in the MOT,
it amounts to
10−2. However, taking into account that a 80% ion to

atom conversion eﬃciency has been reported for the converter used on-line at ISOLDE [52] and that a 16% collection
0.1 is achievable. The
and trapping eﬃciency has been achieved with Fr atoms [39], we can reasonably hope that ζ
SNR is reduced by √ζ. All in all, we can consider that not only does the observation of the forbidden 7S-8S transition
look feasible but so too does a measurement of its magnetic dipole amplitude with an accuracy better than 10%. This
would provide an important test of atomic models [12]. Such an experiment would also give invaluable insight into
how to perform a future measurement of QW (Fr) : for such a measurement to become possible with an eﬃciency
ζ = 10−2, the same enhancement factor κ = 100 as for cesium is required.

B. Prospect for APV observation with an ultra cold atomic beam (proposal 2)

As shown in Table I, the ultra cold beam can a priori oﬀer better performances owing to the possibility of lengthening
the interaction time. However, this advantage is spoiled by the eﬀect of the beam divergence, which one would like
to reduce by a factor of
3. One possibility consists in making additional transverse cooling of the atomic beam
simultaneously at the output of the MM-MOT, using an auxiliary 2D MOT according to a scheme used by the authors
of ref [34] for loading the beam into a magnetic guide. If one wants to beneﬁt from the lowest velocities,
20 cm/s
reported in [34], a priori very interesting here, one has to solve the problem of collisional losses of the slow atomic
beam with atoms in the vapor cell on its way to the interaction region, possibly by using other means for loading the
trap.

Another important technical question, beyond the scope of the present paper, concerns the possibility of combining

the advantages of multiple passages of the longitudinal excitation beam with those of the ultra-cold atomic beam.

C. APV observation with a Zeeman-slowed atomic beam (proposal 3)

S

(P V ), increased by that same factor, becomes √17κ

The number of atoms in the interaction region obtainable with the Zeeman slower is given in table I. It corresponds
to a gain by a factor of √17 with respect to the slow and cold atomic beam (proposal 1). The shot noise limited

S/N ratio for

is necessary. In this experiment, the collimator causes a deﬂection of the atomic beam and a Fabry-Perot cavity
enhancing the intensity of the excitation beam all along the interaction region does not look too unrealistic, but
the enhancement factor required for obtaining the same SNR is comparable to that achieved in Boulder. One may,
however, expect that the high power stored inside the cavity will have here somewhat milder drawbacks. Indeed,
longitudinal excitation allows to all the excited atoms to explore the interference pattern over several wavelengths
during their lifetime, hence the diﬃculty associated with inhomogeneous light shifts causing asymmetric line shapes

In this paper we have addressed the question of how to best use a cold atom source for performing APV mea-
surements. For ﬁghting against the large drawback associated with the small number of atoms compared with cells,
one must take the maximum advantage of their narrow velocity distribution. This advantage makes it possible to
excite a beam of slow and cold atoms by a (co-)antico-linear laser, spatially matching the atomic beam over several
centimeters, without any Doppler broadening. With respect to a thermal beam, the lengthening of the interaction

The new observable reﬂects existence of a circular dichroism. It involves the pseudoscalar ~E
the population of the upper state, hence in the total ﬂuorescence light. Therefore ﬂuorescence detection eﬃciency is
a crucial parameter to be optimized. Moreover, with two interaction regions leading to opposite circular dichroism,
it is possible to make diﬀerential measurements. If, in addition, the spin polarization ~Pe can be sequentially rotated
by π/2, then by combining the four results obtained in the two interaction regions for the two orientations of ~Pe, it
is also possible to achieve important reduction of the systematic eﬀects that birefringence of the optics may generate
from the 104 times larger M1-Stark interference signal.

The merit of cold atom sources relies on their potential to localize atoms, only one of the conditions required
to extend APV measurements in the long term to radioactive isotopes. Suppression of Doppler broadening and
lengthening of the interaction time are other important beneﬁts. However, our estimate of the S/N ratio shows that,
in the present state of the art, those do not appear suﬃcient to solve the diﬃculty of precise APV measurements.
Nevertheless, exploratory experiments performed on stable alkali highly forbidden transitions, can provide a valuable
step enabling us to deﬁne the beam speciﬁcations required for APV experiments with radioactive isotopes. We have
shown that by combining experimental techniques proven elsewhere, there is a reasonable hope of observing the 6S-7S
transition for 133Cs and of making a 10−3 accurate measurement of M hf
1 /β with a beam of slow, cold atoms with
an unsophisticated set-up. Furthermore, such an experiment could be considered as a prototype to evaluate the
production rate of Fr atoms needed to extend such measurements from stable 133Cs to radioactive Fr. With a Zeeman
slower providing a monokinetic beam of high ﬂux and low divergence, PV measurements on 133Cs as precise as those
presently existing do not look impossible, but a real progress with respect to a thermal beam does not look obvious
to us. We hope that our present contribution will stimulate both reﬂections and experimental work towards advances
in this emerging ﬁeld of research.

We are now going to present the derivation of the population signal in the experimental conﬁguration speciﬁed in

parity-violating electric dipole transition amplitudes, and ˆǫ represents the laser polarization.

In the present situation, stimulated emission is totally negligible compared with spontaneous emission and optical

coherences between the two S states can be ignored. We assume that the laser selects one hfs component nS, F
(n+1)S, F’. The excited state density matrix, up to a normalization factor, is then given by:

where ρg is the restriction of the density operator to the nS ground state. PF is the projector on the nS, F sublevel
and PF ′ the projector on the (n+1)S, F’ sublevel. We assume an electronic orientation, ~Pe, has been created in the
ground state:

This deﬁnition implies that : Trρg = 2(2I +1). Therefore, a common normalization factor 1/2(2I+1) has to be applied
to all the quantities computed below. It is taken into account in Eq. 10.

In order to compute the 7S population and its spin polarization, proportional respectively to Tr ρ and Tr ρ~σ, we

apply the Wigner-Eckart theorem to the spin operator ~σ acting in the hyperﬁne subspace F :

the initial state orientation ~Pe, while Eq. 18 gives the orientation of the upper state created by the excitation process,

between those two contributions in which the role of the initial and ﬁnal states is interchanged. (Note the appearance

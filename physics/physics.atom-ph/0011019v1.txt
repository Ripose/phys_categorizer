Abstract

We theoretically examine photoassociation of a two-component Fermi degen-

erate gas. Our focus is on adjusting the atom-atom interaction, and thereby

increaing the critical temperature of the BCS transition to the superﬂuid

state. In order to avoid spontaneous decay of the molecules, the photoassoci-

ating light must be far-oﬀ resonance. Very high light intensities are therefore

required for eﬀective control of the BCS transition.

As the ﬁeld of quantum degenerate vapors emerges from its burgeoning adolescence,

attention is increasingly shifting from Bose [1] to Fermi [2] systems. Beyond degeneracy

itself, much of this eﬀort is concentrated on observing the BCS transition to a superﬂuid

state. However, such investigations are currently at an impasse: the lowest temperature

that has been achieved is about a third of the Fermi temperature [3], whereas the formation

of Cooper pairs requires temperatures colder by at least an order of magnitude [4]. Rather

than ﬁnesse the experiments to lower the temperature of the gas further, a more fruitful

approach might be to adjust the atom-atom interaction so as to raise the value of the critical

temperature. Possible means for adjustment include the magnetic-ﬁeld-induced Feshbach

resonance [5], rf microwave ﬁelds [6], dc electric ﬁelds [7], and photoassociation [8,9]. In fact,

the Feshbach resonance has been recently applied in this manner to induce condensation in

the otherwise incondensable 85Rb [10], and was additionally explored (theoretically) for its

usefulness in spurring the superﬂuid transition [11].

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the utility of photoassociation for inducing

the BCS transition. We [12,13,9] and others [14] have earlier written down ﬁeld theories

for photoassociation of bosons. In the present case we consider instead a binary mixture of

fermionic atoms, given by the ﬁelds φ±(r), photoassociating into a bosonic molecule, given

by the ﬁeld ψ(r). The fermions would typically be two states with diﬀerent z components of

angular momentum in the same atom. As a result of the Pauli exclusion principle, there is

no s-wave photoassociation for two atoms in the same internal state, but such a restriction

does not apply to two diﬀerent spin components.

We thus have a model Hamiltonian density governing photoassociation,

where m is the mass of an atom and δ is the detuning of the laser from the threshold of

photodissociation. The detuning is positive when the photodissociation (inverse of photoas-

sociation) channel is open. The coupling strength for photoassociation is D .

It may be

deduced implicitly from Refs. [12,13], and is discussed explicitly in Ref. [9]. Either way, we

have

|D(r)| = lim

.

(2)

Here Γ(r) is the photodissociation rate that a light with the intensity prevailing at r would

cause in a nondegenerate gas of molecules, given that the laser is tuned in such a way that

the relative velocity of the molecular fragments (atoms) is v, and µ = m/2 is the reduced
mass of two atoms. Because of the statistics, there is a factor of √2 diﬀerence in Eq. (2) from

the corresponding expression for identical bosons. Finally, we have included an interspecies

collisional interaction governed by the s-wave scattering length a in the Hamiltonian.

Under ordinary circumstances photoassociation by absorption of a photon leads to a

molecular state that is unstable against spontaneous emission. There is no particular rea-

son why spontaneous break-up of a primarily photoassociated molecule would deposit the

ensuing atoms back to the degenerate Fermi gases. A spontaneously decaying molecule is

considered lost for our purposes. Correspondingly, we add to the Hamiltonian a nonhermi-

tian term proportional to the spontaneous emission rate of the molecular state γs.

The Heisenberg equation of motion for the molecular ﬁeld ψ is

We assume that the detuning δ is the largest frequency parameter in the problem, and solve

Eq. (3) adiabatically for the ﬁeld ψ. In the process we keep the imaginary part in the energy,

Let us ﬁrst ignore the decay term ∝ γs. Equation (5) displays an added contact interac-

tion between the two spin species, as if from the s-wave scattering length

(6)

The interaction is attractive if the detuning is positive. But an attractive interaction is

exactly what is needed for the BCS transition. To simplify matters we assume here that the

collisional interaction in the absence of light ∝ a is too weak for experiments on the BCS
transition, and ignore the native collisions altogether.

we ﬁnd the loss rate per atom due to spontaneous emission from photoassociated molecules,

To estimate practical experimental numbers, we ﬁrst note that the rate of photoassoci-

ation in a nondegenerate sample at temperature T is [15,16]

R = λ3

Dρ e− ¯hδ

kB T Γ ≡ ρ(cid:18) I

¯hω(cid:19) κ .

(9)

Here λD = q2π¯h2/µkBT is the thermal deBroglie wavelength, I is the intensity (W cm−2)

of photoassociating light, and κ (cm5) is the photoassociation rate coeﬃcients. There may

be statistics dependent numerical factors in Eq. (9). However, in the current literature such

factors are usually ignored, and we write Eq. (9) accordingly.

Using Eq. (9), a calculation or a measurement of the photoassociation rate in a thermal

sample may be converted into a prediction of eﬀective scattering length, transition tem-

perature, and lifetime in a degenerate Fermi-Dirac gas. We express the results in terms of

4

λ = λ/2π, wavelength of photoassociating light divided by 2π, ǫR = ¯h/(2mλ2), familiar pho-

ton recoil frequency, and a characteristic intensity for the given photoassociation transition,

I0. This gives

The obscure numerical factors, powers of 2 and π, are there because we want to use the

characteristic intensity for photoassociation deﬁned in Ref. [9]. For instance, if the photoas-

sociation rate coeﬃcient κ is known at a temperature T and detuning δ, the critical intensity

is

I0 =

√π√¯hδ c¯h4

2κm2(kBT )3/2λ2 e−¯hδ/kB T .

(13)

Detailed microscopic calculations (or measurements) of photoassociation rates are sparse,

but they exist for the fermionic isotope 6Li of lithium [17–20]. Let us consider an example

already discussed in Ref. [9], transitions to the triplet vibrational state v′ = 79 with the

binding energy 1.05 cm−1. The characteristic intensity is then I0 = 9.8 mW cm−2, the wave-

length is λ = 671 nm, and the recoil frequency is ǫR = 63.3× 2π kHz. We take the decay rate
of the molecular state to be twice the spontaneous decay rate of the corresponding atom, so
that γs = 12 × 2π MHz. In our estimate we assume λ3ρ = 1, corresponding to the density
ρ = 8.21× 1014 cm−3 that is high but not unreasonable. It would then take the intermediate
detuning δ = 2 × 2π 1014 Hz and the intensity I = 460 MW cm−2 to make Tc = 0.1 TF and
τ = 10 s.

The intensity came out very high for a continuous-wave laser, so it seems that the only

potential candidate for experiments is a tightly focused, powerful CO2 laser. Our formalism,

though, is based on the assumption that the laser is close to a photoassociating resonance.

We need to amend the calculations to give meaningful estimates for the CO2 laser, whose

5

electric ﬁeld is in practice direct current compared to the molecular transition frequencies

involved.

To this eﬀect we ﬁrst note that in an ordinary two-level system one may carry out

perturbation theory both within the rotating-wave approximation, and in the quasistatic

limit without the rotating-wave approximation as well. The result is that the quasistatic

results are obtained from the near-resonance formulas by replacing the detuning with the

molecular transition frequency, δ → ω0, and multiplying the intensity by two, I → 2I.
Applying this substitution to the scattering length, at λ3ρ = 1 we ﬁnd that the intensity

required for Tc = 0.1 TF again becomes 460 MW cm−2. With the same substitutions, the

lifetime would be about 20 s. However, as the frequency of the CO2 laser is 1/16 of the

resonance frequency for photoassociation, the phase space for spontaneously emitted photons

is reduced, and the actual rate of spontaneous emission would be reduced by an extra factor

of at least 162 ∼ 300. It is clear that spontaneous emission is not an issue with CO2 laser
excitation.

Up to this point we have only considered photoassociation with one molecular state, the

triplet state with vibrational quantum number v′ = 79. Now, in lithium as well as in other

alkali atoms, most of the transition strength for dipole transitions starting from the ground

state is in the D lines. Just a few electronic states in a molecule then inherit most of the

transition strength for photoassociation. We only consider the singlet and triplet excited

manifolds in the 6Li dimer, for which calculations of the photoassociation matrix elements

exist for all vibrational states [17–20]. It turns out that the triplet state v′ = 79 carries about

the factor 0.07 of the total transition strength for photoassociation of low-energy atoms. As

one should obviously add the changes of the scattering lengths due to all molecular states, in

our CO2 laser example the intensity also gets multiplied by 0.07 and becomes 30 MW cm−2.

It is, in principle, possible to tailor the scattering length by oﬀ-resonant photoassociation,

and thereby eﬀect the BCS transition in a low-temperature Fermi gas of, say, 6Li vapor. The

required laser intensities, however, are high. As in the case of coherent photoassociation [9],

the problem is not so much that the matrix elements for photoassociation are weak, but

6

that the primarily photoassociated molecules tend to decay spontaneously and the sample

is lost. To avoid spontaneous emission, one has to go very far oﬀ resonance, which leads to

challenging requirements on laser intensity. In pursuit of BCS transition by means of oﬀ-

resonant photoassociation, it might be worthwhile to try and look for other ways of getting

around the spontaneous emission.

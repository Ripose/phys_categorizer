Observation of atom wave phase shifts induced by van der Waals atom-surface
interactions

The development of nanotechnology and atom optics relies on understanding how atoms behave
and interact with their environment. Isolated atoms can exhibit wave-like (coherent) behaviour with
a corresponding de Broglie wavelength and phase which can be aﬀected by nearby surfaces. Here
an atom interferometer is used to measure the phase shift of Na atom waves induced by the walls of
a 50 nm wide cavity. To our knowledge this is the ﬁrst direct measurement of the de Broglie wave
phase shift caused by atom-surface interactions. The magnitude of the phase shift is in agreement
with that predicted by quantum electrodynamics for a non-retarded van der Waals interaction. This
experiment also demonstrates that atom-waves can retain their coherence even when atom-surface
distances are as small as 10 nm.

The generally accepted picture of the electromagnetic
vacuum suggests that there is no such thing as empty
space. Quantum electrodynamics tells us that even in
the absence of any free charges or radiation the space
between atoms is actually permeated by ﬂuctuating elec-
tromagnetic ﬁelds. An important physical consequence
of this view is that the ﬂuctuating ﬁelds can polarize
atoms resulting in a long range attractive force between
electrically neutral matter: the van der Waals (vdW) in-
teraction [1]. This microscopic force is believed to be
responsible for the cohesion of nonpolar liquids, the la-
tent heat of many materials, and deviations from the
ideal gas law. The vdW interaction can also aﬀect in-
dividual atoms or groups of atoms near a solid surface.
For example, nearby surfaces can distort the radial sym-
metry of carbon nanotubes [2] and deﬂect the probes
of atomic force microscopes [3]. Atom-surface interac-
tions can also be a source of quantum decoherence or
uncontrolled phase shifts, which are an important con-
siderations when building practical atom interferometers
on a chip [4]. For the case of an atom near a surface the
vdW potential takes the form V (r) = −C3r−3, where
C3 describes the strength of the interaction and r is the
atom-surface distance [1].

Previous experiments have shown how atom-surface in-
teractions aﬀect the intensity of atom waves transmit-
ted through cavities [5, 6, 7], diﬀracted from material
gratings [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and reﬂected from surfaces
[13, 14, 15]. However, as we shall see, none of these
experiments provide a complete characterization of how
atom-surface interactions alter the phase of atom waves.
In order to monitor the phase of an atom wave one must
have access to the wave function itself (ψ), not just the
probability density for atoms (|ψ|2).
In this Letter an
atom interferometer is used to directly observe how atom
surface interactions aﬀect the phase of atom waves. This
observation is signiﬁcant because it oﬀers a new measure-

ing δφ(ξ) parts. A plot of the phase φ(ξ) from Eqn. 1 is
shown in Fig. 1 for the cavity geometry and vdW inter-
action strength in our experiment. If these cavities have
a width w and are oriented in an array with spacing d,
then the atom wave far away will have spatially separated

FIG. 2: Experimental setup for vdW induced phase measure-
ment. A Mach-Zhender atom interferometer with paths α and
β is formed using the zeroeth and ﬁrst order diﬀracted beams
of gratings G1 and G2 which have a period of 100 nm. The
atom wave interference pattern is read out using grating G3
as an amplitude mask. The phase fronts (groups of parallel
lines) passing through grating G4 are compressed due to the
attractive vdW interaction, resulting in a phase shift Φo of
beam |αi relative to |βi. This causes the interference pattern
I(x) to shift in space at the plane deﬁned by G3.

where An and Φn are real numbers, and n is the diﬀrac-
tion order number [11]. Experiments which measure the
intensity of atom waves (e.g. atom wave diﬀraction) are
only sensitive to |ψn|2 = |An|2 which is in part inﬂu-
enced by δφ(ξ). However, it is clear from Eqn. 2 that
|ψn|2 reveals no information about φo or Φn. We have
determined A0 and Φ0 by placing this array of cavities
(grating) in one arm of an atom interferometer. This new
technique is sensitive to the entire phase shift φ(ξ) in-
duced by an atom-surface interaction, including the con-
stant oﬀset φo.

The experimental setup for using an atom interferom-
eter to measure the phase shift Φ0 induced by atom-
surface interactions is shown in Fig. 2. A beam of Na
atoms travelling at roughly 2 km/s is generated from an
oven and a position state of the atom wave is selected by
two 10 µm collimation slits spaced 1 m apart. A Mach-
Zehnder type interferometer is formed using the zeroeth
and ﬁrst order diﬀracted beams from three 100 nm pe-
riod silicon nitride gratings [18]. The grating G1 creates
a superposition of position states |αi and |βi which prop-
agate along separated paths α and β respectively. The
states are then recombined using grating G2 and form
a spatial interference pattern at the plane of G3. The
third grating G3 is used as an amplitude mask to deter-
mine the phase and contrast of the interference pattern.
A co-propagating laser interferometer (not shown in Fig.

2

2) was used to compensate for mechanical vibrations of
G1, G2, G3.

When grating G4 is inserted into the interferometer
path α, the interference pattern I(x) shifts in space along
the positive x-direction. This can be understood by re-
calling de Broglie’s relation λdB = h/p [19, 20]. The
atoms are sped up by the attractive vdW interaction be-
tween the Na atoms and the walls of grating G4. This
causes λdB to be smaller in the region of G4, compressing
the atom wave phase fronts and retarding the phase of
beam |αi as it propagates along path α. One could also
say that G4 eﬀectively increases the optical path length
of path α. At G3 the beams |αi and |βi then have a
relative phase between them leading to the state

|χi = A0eiΦ0 |αi + eikg x|βi,

(3)

where kg = 2π/d. The diﬀraction amplitude A0 reﬂects
the fact that beam |αi is also attenuated by G4. The
state |χi in Eqn. 3 then leads to an interference pattern
that is shifted in space by an amount that depends on
Φ0

I(x) = hχ|χi ∝ 1 + C cos(kgx − Φ0),

(4)

where C is the contrast of the interference pattern. In-
serting G4 into path β will result in the same form of the
interference pattern in Eqn. 4, but with a phase shift of
the opposite sign (i.e. Φ0 → −Φ0).

Grating G4 is an array of cavities 50 nm wide and
150 nm long which cause a potential well for the Na
atoms due to the vdW interaction. The atoms trans-
mitted through G4 must pass within 25 nm of the cavity
walls since the open slots of the grating are 50 nm wide.
At this atom-surface distance the depth of the potential
well is about 4 × 10−7 eV. Therefore, as the atoms enter
the grating they are accelerated by the vdW interaction
energy from 2000 m/s to 2000.001 m/s and decelerated
back to 2000 m/s as they leave the grating. This small
change in velocity is enough to cause about a 0.3 rad
phase shift which corresponds to a 5 nm displacement of
the interference pattern. It is quite remarkable to note
that the acceleration and deceleration happens over a
time period of 75 ps implying that the atoms experience
an acceleration of at least 106 g’s while passing through
the grating. This indicates that the vdW interaction is
one of the most important forces at the nanometer length
scale.

The experiment consists of measuring shifts in the po-
sition of the interference pattern I(x) when G4 is moved
in and out of the interferometer paths. The interference
data is shown in Fig. 3. When G4 is placed in path α the
fringes shift in the positive x-direction, whereas placing
G4 in path β causes a shift in the negative x-direction.
Therefore the absolute sign of the phase shift is consis-
tent with an attractive force between the Na atoms and

FIG. 3: Interference pattern observed when the grating G4 is
inserted into path α or β of the atom interferometer. Each in-
terference pattern represents 5 seconds of data. The intensity
error bars are arrived at by assuming Poisson statistics for the
number of detected atoms. The dashed line on the plots is a
visual aid to help illustrate the measured phase shift of 0.3
radians. Notice how the phase shift induced by placing G4
in path α or β has opposite sign. The sign of the phase shift
is also consistent with the atom experiencing an attractive
potential as it passes through G4.

the walls of grating G4. It is also observed that although
the Na atoms are passing within 25 nm of the grating the
atom waves retain their wave like behaviour (coherence),
as evident by the non-zero contrast of the interference
fringes.

The atom interferometer had a linear background
phase drift of approximately 2π rad/hr and non-linear
excursions of ∼1 rad over a period of 10 min, which were
attributed to thermally induced mechanical drift of the
interferometer gratings G1, G2, G3 and phase instability
of the vibration compensating laser interferometer. The
data were taken by alternating between test (G4 in path
α or β) and control (G4 out of the interferometer) condi-
tions with a period of 50 seconds, so that the background
phase drift was nearly linear between data collection cy-
cles. A ﬁfth order polynomial was ﬁt to the phase time
series for the control cases and then subtracted from the
test and control data. All of the interference data was
corrected in this way.

Grating G4 had to be prepared so that it was possi-
ble to obscure the test arm of the interferometer while
leaving the reference arm unaﬀected. The grating is sur-
rounded by a silicon frame, making it necessary to per-
forate G4. The grating bars themselves are stabilized by
1 µm period support bars running along the direction of
kg. The grating naturally fractured along these support
structures after applying pressure with a drawn glass cap-
illary tube. Using this preparation technique G4 had a

FIG. 4: Phase shift Φ0 induced by grating G4 for various atom
beam velocities. The phase shift data has been corrected for
systematic oﬀsets (∼30 %) caused by the interference of other
diﬀraction orders in the atom interferometer and the error
bars reﬂect the uncertainty in the systematic parameters. The
solid line is a prediction of the induced phase shift for vdW
coeﬃcient C3 = 3 meV nm3, grating thickness 150 nm, and
grating open fraction 0.5. The data agrees in magnitude with
the prediction and reproduces the slight trend of decreasing
phase shift with increasing velocity.

transition from intact grating to gap over a distance of
about 3 µm, easily ﬁtting inside our interferometer which
has a path separation of about 50 µm for atoms travelling
at 2 km/s.

Due to the preparation technique, G4 was inserted into
the test arm with kg orthogonal to the plane of the in-
terferometer. This causes diﬀraction of the test arm out
of the plane of the interferometer, in addition to the ze-
roeth order. However, the diﬀracted beams have an ad-
ditional path length of approximately 2 nm due to ge-
ometry. Since our atom beam source has a coherence
length of λdB
= 0.1 nm, the interference caused by
the diﬀracted beams will have negligible contrast. There-
fore, the zeroeth order of G4 will be the only signiﬁcant
contribution to the interference signal.

In principle the amount of phase shift Φ0 induced by
the vdW interaction should depend on how long the atom
spends near the surface of the grating bars. Therefore
the observed phase shift produced by placing G4 in one
of the interferometer paths should depend on the atom
beam velocity in the way described by Eqs. 1 and 2. To
test this prediction the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3
was repeated for several diﬀerent atom beam velocities
and the data are shown in Fig. 4. Systematic phase oﬀ-
sets of (∼30 %) caused by the detected interference of
additional diﬀraction orders generated by G1, G2, G3 in
the atom interferometer (not shown in Fig. 2) have been
corrected for in Fig. 4. The uncertainty of the phase
measurements in Fig. 4 is given by the uncertainty in
the systematic parameters. The measured phase shift

compares well to a prediction of the phase shift Φ0 for
the zeroeth order of grating G4 which includes the vdW
interaction. The value of C3 = 3 meV nm3 used to gener-
ate the theoretical prediction in Fig. 4 is consistent with
previous measurements based on diﬀraction experiments
[11]. It is important to note that if there was no inter-
action between the atom and the grating there would be
zero observed phase shift.

The conﬁrmation of atom-surface induced phase shifts
presented here can be extrapolated to the case of atoms
guided on a chip. Atoms travelling at 1 m/s over a dis-
tance of 1 cm will have an interaction time of 0.01 sec-
onds. According to Eqn. 1, if these atoms are 0.1 µm
from the surface they will acquire a phase shift of 5 × 104
radians due to the vdW interaction. Similarly, if the
atoms are 0.5 µm from the surface they will have a phase
shift of 4 × 102 radians. Therefore, a cloud of atoms 0.1
µm from a surface will have a rapidly varying phase pro-
ﬁle which could severely reduce the contrast of an inter-
ference signal. At some atom-surface distance the vdW
interaction will signiﬁcantly alter atom-chip trapping po-
tentials, resulting in loss of trapped atoms. Atom-chip
magnetic traps are harmonic near their center and can
have a trap frequency of ω = 2π × 200 kHz [17]. Given
the vdW interaction we have observed, such a magnetic
trap would have no bound states for Na atoms if its cen-
ter was closer than 220 nm from a surface. Therefore,
the vdW interaction places a limit on the spatial scale of
atom interferometers built on a chip because bringing the
atoms too close to a surface can result in poor contrast
and atom intensity.

In conclusion the aﬀect of atom-surface interactions
on the phase of a Na atom wave has been observed di-
rectly for the ﬁrst time. When the atom wave passes
within 25 nm of a surface for 75 ps it accumulates a
phase shift of Φ0 ≈ 0.3 rad consistent with an attractive
vdW interaction. The slight velocity dependence of this
interaction has also been conﬁrmed. This experiment
has also demonstrated the non-obvious result that atom
waves can retain their coherence when passing within 25
nm of a surface.
In the future one could use this ex-
periment to make a more precise measurement of C3 at
the 10 % level if the interference of unwanted diﬀraction
orders are eliminated and the window size w of G4 is de-
termined with a precision of 3 %. This level of precision

4

in measuring w is possible with existing scanning electron
microscopes.

We show that the dependence of high-order harmonic generation (HHG) on the molecular orien-
tation can be understood within a theoretical treatment that does not involve the strong ﬁeld of the
laser. The results for H2 show excellent agreement with time-dependent strong ﬁeld calculations for
model molecules, and this motivates a prediction for the orientation dependence of HHG from the
N2 3σg valence orbital. For both molecules, we ﬁnd that the polarization of recombination photons
is inﬂuenced by the molecular orientation. The variations are particularly pronounced for the N2
valence orbital, which can be explained by the presence of atomic p-orbitals.

INTRODUCTION

In this paper we establish a connection between
photoionization/recombination (weak ﬁeld processes)
and high-order harmonic generation (a non-linear phe-
nomenon in strong-ﬁeld physics). The latter process is
one of the most studied aspects of intense-laser physics
because it serves as a source of coherent radiation at high
frequencies [1, 2]. High-order harmonic generation can
be explained by a recollision mechanism [3]: Close to
the maximum of the electric ﬁeld of a femtosecond op-
tical laser pulse a molecule is ionized. A free electron
wave packet enters the continuum and follows the elec-
tric ﬁeld of the laser.
If the laser is linearly polarized
the electron will approach the molecule again. The most
energetic recollisions take place near the second zero of
the laser electric ﬁeld after electron release [3]. Hence,
the laser ﬁeld at the time of recollision can be considered
as small. The optical laser drives the electronic wave
packet far away from the molecule (as compared to the
size of the molecule). Due to rapid wave packet spreading
the electronic wave packet will recollide approximately
as a plane wave with its momentum parallel to the laser
polarization. Possible consequences of recollision are re-
combination, elastic scattering or double ionization. In
the recombination process a photon is emitted, prefer-
ably parallel to the beam axis of the incident laser and
with a frequency that is a multiple of the incident laser
frequency, therefore called high harmonic. By appropri-
ate superposition of diﬀerent harmonics one can create
attosecond pulses which may be utilized to probe fast
atomic and molecular processes [1]. If the return time of
the electronic wave packet is well deﬁned one can even
think of using HHG itself as a probe for time-dependent
processes. The ionization by the laser would represent
the pump pulse and the recolliding wave packet would
represent the probe pulse. The time between those two
events is shorter than an optical cycle of the laser. This
may open the door to the time-resolved investigation of
very fast atomic and molecular processes, cf. also the
method described in Ref. [4].

In recent years there has been growing interest in HHG
from molecules. The dependence on molecular orienta-

tion has been studied experimentally [5] and theoretically
[6]. Considering the complexity of this process, theoret-
ical investigations have been carried out mostly for H2
and H+
2 until now. How to overcome this? As indicated
above, at the time of recollision, when the radiative re-
combination occurs, the electric ﬁeld of the laser can be
considered to be small for the highest harmonics. In the
following we will use an approximation in which the inﬂu-
ence of the laser ﬁeld on the recombination is considered
to be even negligible so that the computational methods
developed in the context of photoionization can be used.
Although this will not cover all the dynamics of HHG, it
should explain quite well dependencies of the high har-
monics on the molecular geometry and orientation. As
we will show, this is indeed the case. As a consequence
it will be possible to describe HHG in much more com-
plicated targets in the future by shifting the focus from
the exact treatment of the time evolution towards the
exact treatment of the ﬁnal molecular interaction, the
recombination in high-order harmonic generation.

II. METHOD

In the recombination process the electron approaches
the molecular core and a photon is ejected, leaving the
molecule predominantly in its ground state. The dy-
namics of this process is contained in its transition am-
plitude. Since recombination is (microscopically) time
reversed photoionization one can use as recombination
transition amplitudes the complex conjugated photoion-
ization transition amplitudes. Furthermore, since we are
here not interested in near threshold behavior we can cal-
culate those photoionization transition amplitudes eas-
ily using the frozen core Hartree Fock (FCHF) method :
The molecular ground state wave function is derived in a
self-consistent-ﬁeld approximation. The state of the ion-
ized molecule is then obtained by removing one electronic
charge out of the orbital that is ionized. The molecule
is not allowed to relax (’frozen core’). The photoelectron
orbitals were obtained using an iterative procedure to
solve the Lippmann-Schwinger equation associated with
the one-electron Schr¨odinger equation that these orbitals

satisfy (for further details see [7]).

For the mathematical description of the process the
density matrix formalism [8] has been applied (see also
[9, 10]). To be able do so we must model the recombina-
tion process. We know the ground states of the neutral
molecule and of the singly charged molecular core,
Λ0i

, respectively. We assume that the molecular
and
i
orientation m does not change during the process. We
also know the state
of the incident electron. (In
the following we will sum over not resolved molecular vi-
brational states and not resolved spin polarization states
of the electron.) Naturally, the photon, with a frequency
ωp, will be polarized. Therefore the full density matrix ρ

A common description of photon polarization employs
the Stokes parameters. The Stokes parameters are de-
ﬁned in a reference frame which z-axis is parallel to the
photon momentum [8]. In this frame the right (left) cir-

The electronic wave function
can be expanded
into spherical harmonics [11]. However, due to the non-
spherical molecular potential the dipole selection rules
do not restrict the expansion as in atoms. Nevertheless,
both, bound and continuum electron wave functions con-
verge quite rapidly. Therefore, to a very good approxi-
mation a limited number of terms is suﬃcient, truncating
the expansion at a certain lmax. ρ(λ, λ′) can be split into

III. RESULTS FOR H2

Using the formulae of the last section one can calculate
the photon intensity and polarization, the Stokes param-
eters, as a function of the electron energy and for diﬀer-
ent orientations of the molecule and electron and photon
propagation directions. Here we will focus on the HHG
geometry (see Fig. 1), where the electron momentum is
perpendicular to the emission direction of the photon. In
the following, we distinguish between two cases: (I) the
molecule lies in the plane spanned by the electron mo-
mentum and the photon direction, and (II) the molecule
rotates in the plane perpendicular to the photon direc-
tion. We have ﬁrst calculated the intensity for H2 recom-
bination in geometry (I) as a function of the molecular
orientation. Here, the photon is polarized parallel to the
electron momentum for symmetry reasons. The calcula-
tion was carried out for diﬀerent bond lengths and for
diﬀerent wavelengths of the electron (see Fig. 2). One
ﬁnds a pronounced minimum, which shifts if one changes
the bond length of the molecule or if one changes the
wavelength of the electron.

One can explain the general behavior at electron wave-
lengths comparable to the bond length of the molecule by
the well-known two-center interference. Here one imag-
ines the diatomic molecule as two centers which are hit
coherently by the same plane electron wave, but with a
phase diﬀerence that depends on the molecular orienta-
tion towards the electron. Recombination leads to the
ejection of a photon. Interference occurs, since it is not

solid curves are for an electron wavelength λe of 1.4 a.u., the
dotted curves for λe = 1.6 a.u. and the dashed curves for λe =
1.8 a.u. (a) Molecular bond length r0 = 1.4 a.u.; (b) r0 =
2.0 a.u.. The positions of minima and maxima are marked by
arrows. Obviously, the positions of the extrema depend on
the bond length and on the wavelength of the electron. This
behavior can be explained by a two-center interference model
(see text). Clearly, the minima are very pronounced.

known which center has emitted the photon. Changing
the electron wavelength and/or the molecular orientation
will alter the phase diﬀerence so that an interference pat-
tern will be obtained. At the energies used here, the pho-
ton wavelength is much larger than the dimension of the
molecule, so that one can neglect the phase shift resulting
from the orientation of the molecule with respect to the
photon. The bond length r0 of the molecule, the electron
wavelength λe and the angle θex between molecular axis
and propagation direction of the electron under which ex-
trema in the recombination photon intensity appear (see
Fig. 1) are then - in the two-center interference picture
- related through

λe + δθ,

n = 0, 1, 2, . . .

where δθ is the diﬀerence of additional phase shifts the
electronic wave function experiences in the vicinity of the
nuclei. In the ideal case those phase shifts are equal and
δθ is zero. δθ depends on the orientation of the molecule
and is expected to be maximal if the molecule is parallel
to the electron momentum and zero if perpendicular. If
δθ is small, interference will be constructive for even n in
Eq. (8) and destructive for odd n. Parallel and perpen-
dicular orientation of the molecule relative to the electron
momentum always give rise to trivial extrema. For ﬁxed
bond length r0 and increasing electron wavelength, min-
ima will occur at positions where the molecule is more
and more aligned along the electron momentum, up to
the point where both are parallel.
In the process the
minimum gets less pronounced and its absolute value is
not approximately zero anymore.

A convenient way of analyzing the extrema is presented
in Fig. 3 where the projection r0 cos(θex) is plotted as a
function of λe. Our results bear a strong resemblance
to those of time-dependent strong ﬁeld calculations of
HHG in H2 and H+
2 model molecules [12]. This supports

extrema in the photon-intensity orientation dependence, the
projection of the bond length on the electron momentum di-
rection, r0 cos(θex), is plotted against the electron wavelength
λe. The dotted (dashed) curve marks minima (maxima) due
to two-centre emittance (see text). The solid curve represents
minima for r0 = 1.4 a.u., whereas the long-dashed (dashed-
dotted) curves represent minima (maxima) for r0 = 2 a.u..
For comparison the extrema in the orientation dependence in
HHG for time-dependent strong ﬁeld calculations for model
molecules [12] are plotted as well: interference minima for (▽)

nition of λe diﬀers from [12].

photon propagation direction which is parallel to the z-axis
in the Stokes parameters frame [geometry (II)]. The electron
is here chosen to move along the x-axis. Shown is as solid

r0 = 1.4 a.u. against the angle between the molecular axis and

except in the small range around the interference min-
imum. This can be understood within the two-center
model since the H2 molecular orbital is approximately
the sum of two atomic 1s-orbitals. These are spherically
symmetric and therefore do not produce a signal polar-
ized perpendicular to the electron momentum.

IV. RESULTS FOR N2

our prior assumption on that one can treat the recom-
bination in HHG approximately as a weak-ﬁeld process.
Also, one ﬁnds the predictions made about the increase
of δθ towards parallel molecular orientation conﬁrmed.
Not surprisingly, the signature of two-center interference
fades with increasing electron wavelength. However, at
the electron wavelengths considered, this eﬀect can be at-
tributed mainly to the decreasing ratio of kinetic energy
of the electron to the ionization threshold. In general, the
orientation dependence of the recombination photon in-
tensity for H2 can be well described within the two-center
interference model.

As indicated, we can calculate all the Stokes param-
eters.
In geometry (I), only linear photon polarization
is possible. In geometry (II), however, where the molec-
ular axis lies in the plane perpendicular to the photon
propagation direction, the photon can have diﬀerent po-
larizations and even circular polarization can be obtained
(see Fig. 4). All polarizations show strong variations in
the vicinity of the interference minimum. Otherwise only
small polarization variations have been found. Thus, al-
though the polarization depends on the geometry, the
diﬀerence is small for H2 because the signal is dominated
by the polarization parallel to the electron momentum

Given the excellent agreement of our H2 results with
time-dependent strong ﬁeld calculations [12] we can move
to a prediction for the orientation dependence of HHG
from the N2 3σg valence orbital. The time-dependent
HHG calculation for this system is quite complicated and
has not been carried out.

While both, H2 1σg and N2 3σg, have the same sym-
metry, they are rather diﬀerent otherwise. While 1σg is
mainly built up from atomic s-orbitals and does not pos-
sess nodes, 3σg is dominated by atomic p-orbitals and
has a more complex structure [13]. As a consequence
the orientation dependence for N2 3σg is more complex
than for H2 1σg. As in the previous section, we have
investigated geometries (I) and (II). In Fig. 5 the ex-
trema for the equilibrium bond length 2.068 a.u. as well
as for 1.768 a.u. and 2.368 a.u. are plotted. Contrary to
H2, there are big diﬀerences between the two geometries.
Figure 6 shows the orientation dependence of the Stokes
parameters for geometry (II). Large variations are found
over a broader range of angles than in H2, i.e., the com-
ponent perpendicular to the electron momentum cannot
be disregarded. At small angles, the signal is still dom-
inated by the polarization parallel to the electron, but
not so for larger angles.

FIG. 5: Projection r0 cos(θex) versus electron wavelength λe
for molecular orientations θex under which minima (x) and

sity. The bond length r0 is 1.768 a.u. in (a) and (d), 2.068 a.u.
in (b) and (e) (ground-state bond length), and 2.368 a.u. in
(c) and (f), respectively. The upper plots [(a), (b), (c)] show
the positions of extrema when the molecule lies in the plane
spanned by the electron and photon direction [geometry (I)],
whereas the molecule rotates in the plane perpendicular to the
photon direction in the lower plots (d), (e), (f) [geometry (II)].
The dotted (dashed) curve is the one for minima (maxima) ac-
cording to the two-center interference model for p-orbital con-
tributions. Note that minima and maxima are interchanged as
compared to the s-orbital contributions. The dashed-dotted
line marks minima according to r0 cos(θex) = 0.75 λe.

Since N2 is a homonuclear diatomic molecule we might
expect to ﬁnd two-center interference in the region where
the wavelength of the electron equals approximately the
internuclear distance. However, Fig. 5 shows that it is
not straightforward to identify such signatures.

To understand the observed behavior, we ﬁrst note
that the two atomic p-orbitals “inside” the N2 valence
orbital are of course not spherically symmetric. There-
fore, unlike s-orbitals, each of them can produce a sub-
stantial component polarized perpendicular to the elec-
tron momentum with a pronounced dependence on the
molecular orientation. However, this component does not
show up in geometry (I). This explains the diﬀerence
between the two geometries. Furthermore, the molec-
ular orbital is not constructed of atomic p-orbitals only,
but we have an s-orbital admixture of about 30%. This
makes the two-center interference picture problematic be-
cause diﬀerent interference patterns are expected for the
two orbital types: to ensure σg symmetry, the two s-
orbitals φs(r
r0/2) and φs(r + r0/2) are added with
the same sign, so that interference conditions are ob-
tained as described for H2; the p-orbitals φp(r
r0/2)
and φp(r + r0/2), on the other hand, are added with op-
posite signs, leading to an interchange of maxima and
minima [12].

Clearly, the simultaneous presence of both types of in-
terference will lead to a complicated orientation depen-

and p3, respectively.

dence. However, we can look for situations where either
s- or p-orbitals dominate the signal. One such case is
geometry (I) near an orientation of 90o. Here, the indi-
vidual p-orbitals generate a negligible signal due to their
mirror antisymmetry, as is obvious when one considers
where
a matrix element of the form
the incoming electron is approximated by a plane wave.
Consequently, s-orbital contributions should dominate.
In fact, Figs. 5(a)-(c) show that in the small-wavelength
regime, geometry (I) yields local maxima at θ = 90o
as a consequence of constructive interference (similar to
H2). Another example is geometry (II), when only the
component perpendicular to the electron momentum is
measured.
In this case, the s-orbital contributions are
small as explained above in the context of H2. Conse-
quently, we should observe the p-type interference pat-
tern, i.e., zero signal at 90o and a series of minima and
maxima when the angle is decreased. This is indeed the
case for small electron wavelengths as is shown in Fig.
7 where the extrema for the perpendicular component
are plotted. In this plot, the extrema are systematically
slightly below the “perfect” two-center interference lines
r0 cos(θex) = n λe/2. The total photon intensity in geom-
etry (II) exhibits a similar behavior, see the lower panels
of Fig. 5. This demonstrates the predominance of the
p-orbital part even in the total signal.

In geometry (I) we have both s- and p-orbital contri-
butions for the small and intermediate angles. Although
in this regime the results cannot be explained in a simpli-
ﬁed picture, we ﬁnd a set of minima (see Fig. 5) following
a straight line r0 cos(θex) = 0.75 λe that lies just in the
middle between the two-center interference lines.

can be described very well in a two-center interference
model. Our results on the orientation dependence bear
a remarkable resemblance with those obtained from the
time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for HHG [12]. This
shows that our method can be used alongside those oth-
ers to obtain estimates about the eﬀects of molecular ge-
ometry and orientation on the photon intensity in HHG.
We have made such a prediction for the case of N2. Fur-
thermore, we have demonstrated, that the photons from
HHG in oriented molecules do not exhibit only linear
polarization. Rather, the polarization of those photons
show strong variations and can even be circular, depend-
ing on the molecular orientation. For N2, the interpreta-
tion of the results within a two-center interference picture
is hampered by the fact that the valence orbital has ad-
mixtures of both atomic s- and p-orbitals, which produce
diﬀerent interference patterns. However, we have pointed
out situations where one of the two orbital types domi-
nates the signal so that interference can be observed.

ized perpendicular to the electron momentum is measured in
geometry (II). (The molecular axis lies in a plane perpendic-
ular to the the photon propagation direction.) The dotted

the two-center interference model for p-orbital contributions.

V. CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we have shown that the orientation de-
pendence of the recombination photon intensity in H2

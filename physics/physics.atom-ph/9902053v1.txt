We use quantum scattering methods to calculate the light-
induced collisional loss of laser-cooled and trapped magne-
sium atoms for detunings up to 30 atomic linewidths to the
red of the 1S0-1P1 cooling transition. Magnesium has no hy-
perﬁne structure to complicate the theoretical studies. We
evaluate both the radiative and nonradiative mechanisms of
trap loss. The radiative escape mechanism via allowed 1Σu ex-
citation is dominant for more than about one atomic linewidth
detuning. Molecular vibrational structure due to photoasso-
ciative transitions to bound states begins to appear beyond
about ten linewidths detuning.

Light-induced collisions between cold, neutral alkali
atoms have been widely studied experimentally and the-
oretically in magneto-optical traps [1–3]. Such collisions
cause loss of atoms from the trap due to radiative or
nonradiative molecular processes after laser excitation
of molecular states of the atom pair at large internu-
clear separation R. These loss processes for alkali atoms
are still not well-understood when the laser detuning ∆
is only a few natural atomic linewidths Γat to the red
of atomic resonance, primarily because of complications
due to the molecular hyperﬁne structure in the alkali
species [3,4]. Molecular vibrational and rotational struc-
ture in the spectrum of loss versus ∆ is unresolved due to
broadening by fast spontaneous decay and the high den-
sity of molecular states. On the other hand, high resolu-
tion photoassociation spectra for trap loss at much larger
detunings are quite well-understood quantitatively, even
for alkali species [3,5].

The study of trap loss collisions in alkaline earth
species oﬀers a signiﬁcant opportunity to improve our
understanding of collisional loss processes in the small
detuning regime. The major isotopes of Be, Mg, Ca, Sr,
and Ba have no nuclear spin, and thus lack hyperﬁne
structure. Alkaline earth atoms can also be cooled and
trapped (e.g. Mg [6], Ca [7], Sr [7,8]). They oﬀer an ex-
cellent and previously rather unexplored testing ground
for cold collision theories. A recent study of Sr has taken
a ﬁrst step in this direction [9]. One intriguing aspect
of the alkaline earth collisions is the possibility to ob-
serve the eﬀect of relativistic retardation corrections on
the trap loss dynamics by exciting a molecular state with
a dipole-forbidden transition at small R which becomes

1

·

allowed at large R. This predicted eﬀect for the 2u state
of alkali species [10] is masked by other states, but may
be prominent for the 1Πg state of alkaline earth species.
In this paper we calculate collisional loss rate coeﬃ-
cients of Mg atoms in a magneto-optical trap, induced by
a weak laser ﬁeld detuned up to 30Γat to the red of atomic
resonance (Γat = 2π
80 MHz). This spans the range from
small detuning, where the spectrum is unstructured, to
the far-detuning range, where resolved photoassociative
features due to speciﬁc molecular vibrations begin to ap-
pear. For 24Mg we assume that the cooling transition is
1S0-1P1, (λ = 285.2 nm). Fig. 1 shows the short-range
part of the Mg2 potentials [11]. A laser with ∆
1-
30 Γat excites molecular states with attractive potentials
at some Condon distance RC >
250 a0 (a0 = 0.0529177
nm). In 24Mg these states can be either the 1Σ+
∼
u state or
the 1Πg state. Spin-orbit coupling HSO mixes 1Πg with
the 3Σg state at a curve crossing around R
7 a0 and
∼
mixes 1Σ+
5 a0. After a change
of molecular state the quasimolecular atom pair can sep-
arate to a 1S0 atom and a 3P atom (3P0, 3P1 or 3P2),
with a shared kinetic energy increase equal to about 0.06
19 000 K). These hot atoms can
atomic units (∆E/kB ∼
not be recaptured by the trapping and cooling lasers and
they are thus lost from the trap. In alkalis this process
arises from collisional transfer between two ﬁne structure
states of the same electronic conﬁguration, and is called
the ﬁne structure changing mechanism (FS). Here we call
it the state changing mechanism (SC) between diﬀerent
electronic states.

After excitation at RC the quasimolecule obtains ki-
netic energy via internal acceleration by the attractive
potentials. If it decays back to the ground state, it pre-
serves this gain in kinetic energy, thereby increasing the
kinetic energy of the asymptotic collision products (two
1S0 atoms). If the energy gain exceeds the trap depth,
the atoms can escape from the trap. This is the radia-
tive escape mechanism (RE). Spontaneous emission has
a crucial role in both the SC and RE loss mechanisms,
and has to be included in the theoretical treatment.

The structure of the quasimolecule at large R is deter-
mined by the dipole-dipole interaction, for which we use
the long-range retarded potentials from Ref. [12]. These
join with the short-range wells in Fig. (1) to give poten-
tials that support a number of bound vibrational states
of the quasimolecule. The molecular linewidths with rel-
ativistic retardation corrections for the two relevant ex-

we get ΓΣu ≃
that the optical coupling between the quasimolecule and
the laser ﬁeld is proportional to √ΓA (A = Σu, Πg). As
detuning ∆ increases the probability to excite the 1Πg
state is reduced. On the other hand, the survival of the
quasimolecule on the 1Πg state is much better than for
the 1Σu state. We expect that RE loss comes mainly from
the 1Σu state, and that qualitatively the 1Πg state and
the 1Σu state contributions to SC loss behave diﬀerently
as a function of ∆. The important question is the relative
magnitudes of the various loss mechanisms.

The standard small-detuning studies of trap loss ignore
the vibrational structure of the trap loss, and consider
the problem as a fully dynamical one, involving only the
electronic potentials [2]. This is based on the expecta-
tion that at small detunings the vibrational structure can
not be resolved. In the time-dependent picture this sim-
ply means that after the excitation at large R the quasi-

2

molecule decays well before it completes one or more vi-
brations. However, here the retardation eﬀect opens the
1Πg state for excitation but closes it quickly for decay, so
we might expect to see vibrational structure in trap loss
even at small detunings if the 1Πg state SC contribution
dominates over the 1Σu state SC and RE contributions.
The ground state potential of Mg2 is essentially ﬂat in
the long-range region of excitation. Since a number of
total angular momentum J values contribute to trap loss
in our detuning range, we assume that eﬀects of the un-
known phase shifts in the ground state wavefunctions due
to the short-range potential is removed by summing over
J and thermal averaging. Thus, we represent the ground
state potential by a Lennard-Jones 6-12 potential with a
well depth of 0.0028 atomic units and an inner turning
point of 6.23 a0 [11]. Since the excited ab initio poten-
tials do not permit a calculation of vibrational levels to
spectroscopic accuracy, the speciﬁc forms of the short-
range excited state potentials are not important for our
purposes of modeling the qualitative structure and mag-
nitude of the collisional loss. We ﬁt Lennard-Jones 3-6
potentials to the ab initio potentials of Ref. [11], keeping
the long-range form ﬁxed to its known value. Modeling
of experimental data should ultimately permit calibra-
tion of the unknown phases associated with the uncertain
inner parts of the potentials.

A complete study must include the three-dimensional
aspects of molecular rotation. Since all collision direc-
tions are possible relative to laser polarization, the ef-
fect of axis rotation is to introduce the usual molecular
branch structure of the possible transitions. The angular
momentum J ′′ in the ground state can only be that of
axis rotation, or partial wave ℓ′′ = J ′′.
In the excited
state 1Σ, 1Π molecular basis, ℓ is not a good quantum
number but total angular momentum J ′ is. The possi-
ble transition branches are P, Q, and R, for which J ′ =
J ′′
1, J ′′, and J ′′ + 1 respectively. The quasimolecule
ground state can couple to the 1Σu state only by P and R
branches, but to the 1Πg state by P, Q and R branches.
The radiative coupling terms for the two electronic states
for each branch and partial wave ℓ′′ are shown in Table I.

Since the laser ﬁeld is assumed to be weak, reexcitation
of any decayed quasimolecular population can be ignored
and loss rates can be calculated by the complex potential
method [13,14]. Additionally, each ground state partial
wave only couples to the rotational states of the 1Σu
or 1Πg state, but these states do not couple further to
other ground state partial waves. Thus, the weak ﬁeld
approximation permits us to truncate the problem into
a set of independent three-state problems for each initial
partial wave with one ground state g, one excited state
e, and one probe state p. The total thermally averaged

tain the S-matrix elements.

For the SC loss studies the probe state represents
the actual loss channel due to the curve crossings men-
tioned above which cause transitions to the molecular
states which separate to 1S0+3P atoms. The short-
range molecular spin-orbit couplings are approximated
using Table A1 of Ref. [15]. The 1Σu-3Πu and 1Πg-3Σg
matrix elements are λ/√2 and λ/2 respectively, where
10−4 atomic units is 2/3 of the atomic 3P2-
λ = 1.84

For the RE studies we assume that the trap depth is
0.5 K, and set the probe state to cross the excited quasi-
molecular state at the point Re where a kinetic energy

Fig. 2 shows calculated rate coeﬃcients K for SC loss
for both states at laser intensity I = 1 mW/cm2. K
scales linearly with I in the weak ﬁeld limit. When ∆
is small, the magnitude of K for the 1Σu state is small
and vibrational state structure is clearly suppressed even
before thermal averaging; some structure begins to ap-
10Γat. However, for the 1Πg state
pear beyond ∆
strongly modulated vibrational structure persists over
the whole range of detuning with comparable peak mag-
nitudes. The 1Πg vibrational structure is broadened but
not eliminated by the sum over rotational state structure
and by thermal averaging. The speciﬁc vibrational peak
locations versus ∆ for both states depend on our par-
ticular choice for the excited state potentials and may
be expected to shift if the correct potentials were used.
However, the magnitudes and qualitative nature of the
oscillations will be independent of this choice. For very
small detunings the 1Πg state dominates SC loss, due
to much more favorable survival after excitation. For
∆ >
1Σu and 1Πg contributions become roughly
∼
equal. The survival probability relative to spontaneous
decay at long range approaches unity for the 1Σu state
when ∆ >
10Γat. Note that the magnitude of the rate
coeﬃcients for both 1Σu and 1Πg states is rather small,
∼
on the order of 10−14 cm3/s. This is because of the rela-
tively small spin-orbit matrix elements at the short-range
crossings.

10Γat

The RE loss for the 1Σu state, shown in Fig. 3, qualita-
tively follows that of the corresponding 1Σu state SC loss
(see the inset in Fig. 3), but is about 200 times stronger.
Because of this inherently larger magnitude for RE loss,
trap loss for Mg is predominantly due to the 1Πg state
only for very small detunings on the order of Γat. Radia-
tive escape via 1Σu excitation is dominant at all larger
detunings and masks any vibrational structure due to
1Πg SC loss. Vibrationally resolved (but not rotation-
ally resolved) photoassociative structure should begin to
appear due to 1Σu excitation for detunings larger than
around 1 GHz, with a rate coeﬃcient on the order of
10−12 cm3/s for I = 1 mW/cm2.

Our calculations for Mg shed some light on Sr colli-
sions. Since the spin-orbit coupling strength λ is a factor
of 9.6 larger for Sr than for Mg, the SC loss will be much
stronger in Sr than we ﬁnd here for Mg, and thus will
compete with RE as a loss mechanism. If we simply scale
up our peak magnitude of 1Πg loss at ∆ = 4Γat linearly
in intensity I and by the increased λ2 factor (diﬀerences
in mass also need to be taken into account), the result-
ing rate coeﬃcient has the same order of magnitude as
that which was recently measured [9]. This suggests that
Sr trap loss at small detuning, unlike that for Mg, has a
prominent contribution from SC by the 1Πg state, consis-
tent with the understanding of Ref. [9]. Since it is likely

that Sr will have a modulated photoassociation spectrum
at small ∆ analogous to Fig. 2b, measuring trap loss ver-
sus ∆ would be a very useful experiment to try for the
Sr system. Such modulations might also be observed in
both Sr and Mg by detecting 3P0,1,2 product atoms, as
in similar alkali experiments [4,16].

Exploring the alkaline earth systems oﬀers

the
prospects for some very fruitful science. There is clearly
a need for better ab initio or semiempirical potentials
and long-range dispersion coeﬃcients. Photoassociation
spectroscopy over a wide range of detuning values should
help characterize ground and excited state potentials and
ground state scattering lengths [3]. The recent cooling of
Sr below 1 µK using the 1S0-3P1 transition [8] raises the
possibility of achieving Bose-Einstein condensation with
an alkaline earth species. Comparing experimental trap
loss for alkaline earth isotopes with and without hyper-
ﬁne structure might also shed some light on the role of
hyperﬁne structure in alkali trap loss.

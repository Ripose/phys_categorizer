(Dated: August 13, 2013)

We report the ﬁrst measurements of linear and nonlinear magneto-optical polarization rotation
on an intercombination transition of Ba vapor (λ = 791.1 nm). We observe a maximum polarization
rotation angle in Faraday conﬁguration of 15 mrad, accompanied by suppression of absorption. A
theoretical treatment of the nonlinear Faraday eﬀect in the limit of a strong interacting light ﬁeld
is developed.

PACS numbers: 33.55.-b,42.50.Gy

In the last few decades, nonlinear magneto-optical ef-
fects (NMOE) have been studied thoroughly in various
experimental conﬁgurations, and they have been used or
proposed to be used for many practical applications, in-
cluding precision metrology and fundamental symmetry
tests (for a review see Ref. [1]). The majority of exper-
iments, however, are focused on the interaction of reso-
nant light with alkali atoms like Rb, Cs and Na. There
are only a few publications reporting studies of NMOE
for alkaline-earth atoms: the study of nonlinear Faraday
and Voigt eﬀects in Sm [2, 3] and the study of the nonlin-
ear Faraday eﬀect in the regime of strong magnetic ﬁelds
in Ca [4].

We present here the ﬁrst (to our knowledge) mea-
surements of nonlinear magneto-optical polarization ro-
tation in Ba vapor for laser radiation resonant with
the 6s2 1S0 → 6s6p 3P1 intercombination transition
(λ = 791.1 nm). This transition is of particular interest
since the angular momentum of the ground state is zero,
and the nonlinear eﬀects are due to the interference of the
magnetic sublevels of the excited sublevels in a V level
scheme. It should be noted that although there exists a
number of theoretical calculations of nonlinear polariza-
tion rotation in J = 0 → J ′ = 1 transitions [5, 6, 7], ex-
perimental results are very limited [3]. Coherence eﬀects
in a V -type level conﬁguration have also been studied in
regards to lasing without inversion [8, 9, 10], but with
very little experiments focused on the dispersive proper-
ties of this system.

The interaction of linearly polarized light with the
intercombination transition of Ba forms an ideal V
scheme which cannot be realized in, for example, alkali
atoms because of their richer Zeeman structure. It has
been demonstrated that ground state coherence may be
formed due to radiative coherence transfer if the ground
state is degenerate even in the case of higher degeneracy
of the excited state [11, 12, 13], which may obscure the
observation of the coherence between excited states. It
is also important that the radiative width of the excited
state 3P1 is small (γr = 2π × 100 kHz) which is true for
the majority of alkaline-earth elements. Thus, the co-
herence created between the excited state sublevels may

exist long enough to produce a noticeable nonlinear ef-
fect.

In addition, since the frequencies of the intercombina-
tion transition in Ba and the D1 line of Rb are very close
(∆λ ≈ 3 nm) it is logical to expect resonant enhancement
of the spin-exchange cross-section between atoms of the
two species. Therefore, the study of linear and nonlinear
eﬀects in Ba should provide accurate information about
the interaction with Rb atoms and vice versa.
In this
case Ba atoms may be used to monitor the properties of
very dense Rb vapors.

In this paper we ﬁrst present the experimental data for
saturation absorption spectroscopy of Ba atoms. These
data provide the necessary information about level struc-
ture of various Ba isotopes, and allow better calibration
of the magnetic ﬁeld. Then we study the linear and non-
linear Faraday eﬀects for diﬀerent experimental parame-
ters. In the last section we analyze the observed experi-
mental data using density matrix formalism.

I. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

A. Sapphire Ba cell

In this experiment we use a sealed cylindrical sapphire
cell (SC) containing pure Ba with birefringence-free win-
dows made of garnet (YAG) crystal. This cell allows
operation at high-temperature (up to 600◦C on the win-
dows). The length of the cell is L = 102 mm, with an
inner diameter of 10.7 mm. The residual vacuum in the
SC is ∼ 10−3 Torr.

Heating elements are placed closer to the windows to
avoid condensation of Ba vapor on the windows of the SC
and to prolong its useable lifetime. The temperature is
then measured by two nonmagnetic thermocouples: one
is placed next to the window so it detects the highest
temperature of the SC, and the other is located in the
central part of the cell to detect the lowest temperature.
Both the SC and the heaters are surrounded by a thermo-
isolating material (“shamot”).

We conduct the experiment at two diﬀerent tempera-
tures of the SC: at 490◦C (temperature on the window
is 515◦C), and at 540◦C (temperature on the window is
560◦C). There is no well-established dependence of Ba
vapor pressure on its temperature, as it is noted in [14].
Below, we give the standard function describing this de-
pendence, and the numerical values of the coeﬃcients
from diﬀerent studies:

We need to point out that the values of atomic densities
calculated using the various tabulated coeﬃcients are not
consistent with each other for our experimental tempera-
tures. In the following we will use the most recent study
of Jacob et al. [17] which gives the values of Ba atomic
densities for our experiment to be N = 3.3 × 1011cm−3
and N = 1.8 × 1012cm−3. The data from [15] give values
about 40% lower, whereas those of [16] give a Ba pressure
an order of magnitude larger.

B. Experimental conﬁguration

A simpliﬁed scheme of the experimental setup is shown
in Fig. 1. We use an external cavity diode laser (ECDL),
tuned to the vicinity of the 6s2 1S0 → 6s6p 1P3 inter-
combination transition of atomic Ba. The laser beam
passes through a high-quality polarizer P1 (to insure the
quality of the linear polarization). A half-wave plate
placed in front of the polarizer allows smooth control
of the intensity of the laser beam at the SC. The cell
(with the heaters and thermal isolation) is mounted in
the center of triaxial Helmholtz coils to control the mag-
netic ﬁeld within the interaction region. The system con-
sists of three mutually orthogonal pairs of square coils in
Helmholtz conﬁguration, with the magnetic ﬁeld inhomo-
geneity of ±5 mG within a 10 cm cubical central region.
After traversing the Ba cell, the transmission and the
polarization rotation are analyzed by using a polariza-
tion beam splitter (P2 in Fig. 1) tilted at 45 degrees with
respect to the polarizer P1.
In this conﬁguration, the

II. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

A. Saturation absorption spectroscopy of Ba

The transmission spectra of the laser is shown in Fig. 2.
The central absorption peak is due to the even isotopes
of Ba, mainly 138Ba which accounts for 70% of natural
Ba with an addition of 136Ba (6%), 134Ba (2%) and 132Ba
(1%). Since the nuclear spin for all even isotopes is zero,
there is no hyperﬁne structure. Natural Ba also contains
relatively small amount odd isotopes 137Ba (10%) and
135Ba (10%), which are responsible for the adjacent ab-
sorption peaks in Fig. 2. Since the nuclear spin of the
odd isotopes is I = 3/2, we observe three resolved ab-
sorption lines corresponding to the resonant transition
to the excited hyperﬁne states with F ′ = 1/2, 3/2, and
5/2.

It has been demonstrated that extremely narrow res-
onances may be observed in Ba atoms using saturation
absorption spectroscopy [18, 19]. In our experiments, we
also record Doppler-free spectra in the Ba vapor cell, but
mainly for isotope identiﬁcation and frequency calibra-
tion.

The part of the laser beam reﬂected from the polarizer
P1 is used as a counterpropagating pumping beam. The
ratio between pump and probe ﬁeld intensities is con-
trolled by the half-wave plate placed before P1, and the

polarization of the pump beam may be changed by half-
or quater-wave plates placed after the polarizer. The
width (FWHM) of the observed resonances is ≈ 8 MHz,
which is determined by the spectral width of the laser
radiation and residual Doppler eﬀect. It is also interest-
ing that the amplitude of the observed resonances shows
no dependence on the polarization of the pumping beam.
The positions of the transmission peaks are in very good
agreement with previously published data [20].

levels of the excited states in the presence of a longi-

even isotopes the gyromagnetic ratio of the 3P1 state is
g = 3/2, which corresponds to a 2.11 MHz/G shift of
the magnetic sublevels [21]. We have measured the split-
ting of the saturation absorption resonances as a func-
tion of applied magnetic ﬁeld. The results are shown in
Fig. 3. This method provides an accurate calibration of
the magnetic ﬁeld in the system. We also detected the
Zeeman splitting for the transitions of the odd isotopes.
However, individual magnetic resonances are not clearly
resolved there due to the rich magnetic substructure of
the hyperﬁne levels.

B. Nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects

Let us ﬁrst consider the case when the magnetic ﬁeld is
applied along the propagation direction of the laser beam
(Faraday conﬁguration). The spectra of the polarization
rotation angle for diﬀerent magnetic ﬁelds are shown in
Fig. 4. One can clearly see two diﬀerent regimes:
for
smaller values of magnetic ﬁeld (B ≤ 2 G) the rotation
spectrum consists of one peak, whereas for higher mag-
netic ﬁelds it becomes almost antisymmetric with respect
to the center of the absorption line.

This behavior may be partially explained if we assume
that for small magnetic ﬁeld the nonlinear magneto-
optical rotation is observed, and for higher B the lin-
ear interaction becomes dominant. We can check this
hypothesis by looking at the dependance of the polar-

ization rotation angle on the laser power in both cases.
Nonlinear polarization rotation is caused by the light-
induced coherence between the m = ±1 sublevels of the
excited state, and therefore the magnitude of the rota-
tion angle should depend on the light intensity. This will
be shown in the next Section. Measurements of the rota-
tion angle, shown in Fig. 5a are in good agreement with
this statement. This also means that in some cases (for
example, when the atomic transition is weak) it may be
more convenient to study atomic transitions with NMOE
spectroscopy than by absorption spectroscopy.

The linear Faraday eﬀect, in which the polarization
rotation is determined by the dispersion of the atomic
transition, should not demonstrate any dependence on
laser intensity. Fig. 5b shows the amplitudes of both ro-
tation peaks in the linear regime. One can see that the
amplitude of the positive peak does not change at all,
whereas that of negative peak reduces a little as the laser
power increases. This variation may be due to residual
nonlinear Faraday eﬀect. Overall, the behavior of the ro-
tation angle indicates that the polarization rotation for
high magnetic ﬁeld is due to the linear interaction. How-
ever, there is no clear explanation of the antisymmetric
shape of the rotation spectra. It is conceivable that it
may be due to the inﬂuence of other even isotopes, even
though there is no clear physical reasons why they cause
the polarization rotation in the opposite direction, or of
the magnitude comparable with that of 138Ba.

It is also important to note that in the regime of nonlin-
ear interaction we observe suppression of absorption for
small values of magnetic ﬁeld. This is a manifestation of
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency [22, 23, 24]
due to the Zeeman coherence created on the excited
states magnetic sublevels. The absorption spectra for
diﬀerent values of magnetic ﬁeld are shown in Fig. 6.
One can also see that no change in the laser absorption
occurs in the linear interaction regime.

We have also investigated the nonlinear magneto-
optical polarization rotation in the presence of a trans-
verse magnetic ﬁeld. The magnetic ﬁeld is applied per-
pendicular to both the electric component of the electro-
magnetic ﬁeld and its propagation direction (along the
z axis). The polarization rotation spectra is shown in
Fig. 7. The magnitude of the polarization rotation is
almost an order of magnitude smaller than that for the
nonlinear Faraday eﬀect. The other important diﬀerence
is that the dependence of the rotation angle on the mag-
netic ﬁeld is symmetric in the case of the transverse mag-
netic ﬁeld, and asymmetric for the longitudinal magnetic
ﬁeld (not shown in the graphs).

To verify the nonlinear nature of the observed polar-
ization rotation, we have measured the dependence of the
polarization rotation on the laser intensity. As one can
see in Fig. 8, the rotation angle is proportional to the
power of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, although this depen-
dence is not linear.

Because of the symmetry of the system, a magnetic
ﬁeld applied parallel to the polarization direction of the
linearly polarized magnetic ﬁeld (the x-axis) should not
produce any rotation.
In the experiment, we observe
some small (< 0.5 mrad) rotation angle in the presence
of magnetic ﬁeld along the x-axis, probably due to mis-

III. THEORETICAL ANALYSIS

The level scheme of the Ba transition is shown in Fig. 9.
Two components of the linearly polarized light link the
ground state |m = 0i and two excited states |m′ = ±1i
into a V conﬁguration; the third magnetic sublevel of the
excited state cannot be excited because of the selection
rules. We call the detuning of the laser from the atomic
resonance ∆, and the Zeeman splitting of the magnetic
sublevels of the excited states δ. Then the interaction
Hamiltonian for this system in the rotating wave approx-
imation is given by:

H = ~(∆ − δ)|−ih−| + ~(∆ + δ)|+ih+|
− ~ (Ω+|+ih0| + Ω−|−ih0| + h.c.)

(2)

Here and for the remainder of this discussion we let the
states |±i and |0i refer correspondingly to the magnetic
sublevels of the excited states m′ = ±1 and the ground
state with m = 0.

Here γr is the radiative decay rate of the excited states
m = ±1 to the ground state, ˜γr is the decay outside of the
three-level system, γ0 characterizes the ﬁnite interaction
time of the atoms with the laser beam. In the following
calculations, we assume that γ0 is small compared to γr,
and deﬁne γ = γr + ˜γr as the total radiative decay rate
of the excited states. For simplicity, we neglect the eﬀect
of spontaneous emission-induced coherent eﬀects [25].

After solving Eqs. (3-6) in the steady-state regime, we

obtain the following expression for the polarization

Let us ﬁrst brieﬂy consider the linear interaction regime,
such that magneto-optical eﬀects do not depend on the
intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld and are determined
solely by the resonant absorption and dispersion of the
two-level interaction. From Eq. (9) it is easy to see
that this regime is observed either for low intensity of
the laser ﬁeld (|Ω±| ≪ γ), or for strong magnetic ﬁeld
(δ ≫ |Ω±|, |Ω±|2/γ). In this case no coherence between
excited states is created. The populations of the excited
magnetic sublevels are determined by Rabi frequencies of
the corresponding circularly polarized electro-magnetic

ﬁelds, and are small compared to the ground-state pop-
ulation. Thus, the propagation equation for the circular
components of the laser ﬁeld is:

total intensity of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. Substituting
Ω± = |Ω±| exp iφpm and taking the real part of Eq. (10)
we arrive at expressions for the absorption coeﬃcient
α (deﬁned as |Ω(L)|2 = |Ω(0)|2e−αL, where |Ω(L)| and
|Ω(0)| are the values of the Rabi frequencies of the laser
ﬁeld before and after the cell)

the most probable velocity, kb is the Boltzmann constant,
T is the temperature of atomic vapor in K, and m is the
mass of a Ba atom. Because of the Doppler eﬀect, the
atoms from diﬀerent velocity groups resonate at diﬀerent
frequencies. To account for this in our calculations it is
necessary to modify Eq. (10) by replacing the one-photon
detuning ∆ with ∆+kv, where k = 2π/λ is the wave vec-
tor of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, and then averaging the
right-hand side of Eq. (10) over the velocity distribution.
The nonlinear magneto-optical eﬀects appear due to
the coherence which may be created among the Zeeman
sublevels of the excited state. Unlike a three-level Λ sys-
tem, where the ground-state coherence arises from optical
pumping of the atoms in the noninteracting superposition
of two ground-states (the “dark state”), in a V scheme
the coherence between the two excited states is formed
by the interference of diﬀerent excitation passes [22].

In the approximation of strong electromagnetic ﬁeld
(|Ω| ≫ γ) we may assume that the population distri-
bution in the system is determined mostly by the ﬁeld.
Therefore, we can assume that the atom is in one of the
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (2), which allow us to ﬁnd
the values of the populations of all levels in zeroth ap-

This result is in a good agreement with the previous cal-
culations [5] in the limit of optically thin medium. Note
that this expression is very similar to that for the Λ sys-
tem [26] with the decay rate of the ground-state coher-
ence replaced by the radiative decay of the excited states.
From Eq. (18) one can see that the polarization rota-
tion angle is inversely proportional to the radiative width
of the excited state. Therefore, it is clear that several or-
ders of magnitude may be gained in polarization rotation

and other nonlinear eﬀects in V interaction scheme by
using narrow alkaline-earth intercombination transitions
compared with traditional alkali atoms.

It is easy to see, however, that the theory developed
above predicts much larger values of the polarization ro-
tation angle than experimentally observed. There are
several eﬀects which may contribute to this discrepancy.
For example, we do not to take into account thermal
motion of atoms which, from one hand, leads to the in-
homogeneous Doppler broadening, and from the other
hand - limits the interaction time of Ba atoms with light.
Indeed, the average thermal speed of Ba atoms at about
500o C is about 300 m/s, which corresponds to a de-
cay rate γ0 ≈ 2π × 50 kHz and is comparable with
the radiative width of the transition. This may change
the population distribution between atomic levels. An-
other important factor is the presence of relatively dense
(> 1013 cm−3) Rb vapor due to small contamination of
Ba sample, since it has been demonstrated that collisions
cause the reduction of the polarization rotation [5].

IV. SUMMARY

In this paper, we have presented an experimental study
of linear and nonlinear optical eﬀects on the intercombi-
nation transition 6S-6P of Ba atoms in sealed vapor cell.
We study the Zeeman shift of the magnetic sublevels of
the excited state and measure the polarization rotation
spectra in presence of longitudinal and transverse mag-
netic ﬁelds. These nonlinear optical eﬀects can have a
wide range of applications as a spectroscopic tool with
good resolution and sensitivity for studying weak atomic
transitions.

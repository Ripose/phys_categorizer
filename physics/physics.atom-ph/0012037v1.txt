Abstract

Scattering of positronium (Ps) by helium atom has been investigated in a
three-Ps-state coupled-channel model including Ps(1s,2s,2p) states using a re-
cently proposed time-reversal-symmetric regularized electron-exchange model
potential. Speciﬁcally, we report results of diﬀerential cross sections for elastic
scattering and target-elastic Ps excitations. We also present results for total
and diﬀerent partial cross sections and compare them with experiment and
other calculations.

Scattering of exotic ortho-positronium atom with long life time (142 ns) by neutral gas
atoms and molecules is of fundamental interest in both physics and chemistry. Recent high
precision measurements of positronium (Ps) scattering by H2, N2, He, Ne, Ar, C4H10, and
C5H12 [1–6] have enhanced theoretical activities [7–11] in this subject. Due to internal
symmetry the direct static Born potential for elastic and even-parity transitions for these
processes is zero and exchange correlation plays an important role for a correct description
at low energies [10,11].

Recently, we suggested [12] a regularized nonlocal electron-exchange model potential
with a single parameter C and used it in the successful study of of Ps scattering by H
[13,14], He [12,15], Ne [15], Ar [15] and H2 [16,17]. Our results were in agreement with
experimental total cross section [1,3], specially at low energies for He, Ne, Ar and H2. In
our initial calculations we used a non-symmetric form of the model exchange potential for
Ps scattering by H [14], He [12], and H2 [16]. Subsequent studies yielded improved results
with a time-reversal symmetric form of the model potential for Ps scattering by H [13] and
H2 [17]. For H it was found [13] that the symmetric potential yielded excellent results for
S-wave singlet Ps-H binding and resonance energies in agreement with accurate variational
calculations [18]. The symmetric potential also led to very good results [15] for low-energy
cross sections for Ps scattering by He, Ne, Ar, and H2 in excellent agreement with experiment
[3].

The problem of Ps-He scattering is of relevance to both experimentalists and theoreti-
cians. Theoretically, it is the simplest of all Ps-scattering problems, which has reliable ex-
perimental cross sections. Once a good theoretical understanding of this system is obtained,
we can try to understand the problem of Ps scattering by complex atoms and molecules.

With this objective we reinvestigate the problem of Ps scattering by He at higher energies
using the time-reversal symmetric form of the exchange potential. We consider the three-
Ps-state coupled-channel model with Ps(1s,2s,2p) states for calculating diﬀerent elastic and
inelastic cross sections of Ps-He scattering. We calculate the diﬀerent Ps-He diﬀerential
cross sections which are of great interest to experimentalists [5], in addition to the diﬀerent
angle-integrated partial cross sections. The diﬀerential cross sections carry detailed infor-
mation about the scattering process. Cross sections for higher excitations and ionization
of Ps are calculated by the Born approximation and added to the above Ps(1s,2s,2p) cross
sections to yield the total cross section which is compared with experiment.

The theory for the coupled-channel study of Ps-He scattering with the regularized model
potential has already appeared in the literature [7,12,13,15]. It is worthwhile to quote the
relevant working equations here. For target-elastic Ps-He scattering we solve the following

ν′ are the
binding energy parameters of the initial and ﬁnal He orbital and Ps states in atomic units,
respectively, and C is the only parameter of the potential. Normally, the parameter C is
taken to be unity which leads to reasonably good result [15,17,23]. However, it can be varied
slightly from unity to get a precise ﬁt to a low-energy observable. This variation of C has
no eﬀect on the scattering observables at high energies and the model exchange potential
reduces to the Born-Oppenheimer exchange potential [19] at high energies. In the present
study we use the value C = 0.84 throughout. This value of C leads to a very good ﬁt of the
elastic Ps-He cross section with the experiment of Skalsey et al. [3]. This exchange potential
for Ps scattering is considered [12] to be a generalization of the Ochkur-Rudge exchange
potential for electron scattering [20].

After a partial-wave projection, the system of coupled equations (1) is solved by the
method of matrix inversion. A maximum number of partial waves Jmax is included in
solving the system of coupled equations. The diﬀerential and angle-integrated partial cross
sections so calculated are augmented by Born results for higher partial waves J > Jmax.
A maximum of 40 Gauss-Legendre quadrature points are used in the discretization of each
momentum-space integral. The calculations are performed with the exact Ps wave functions
and the HF orbitals for He ground state [21]. Although it is relatively easy to obtain
converged results for angle-integrated partial cross sections, special care is needed to obtain
converged results for diﬀerential cross sections at higher energies. Coverged results for
partial cross sections are obtained for Jmax = 30 at all energies. For obtaining convergent
diﬀerential cross sections, we need to take Jmax = 150 partial waves at 100 eV. However,
Jmax = 30 is suﬃcient for obtaining convergent diﬀerential cross sections at 20 and 30 eV.
Here we present results of Ps-He scattering using the three-Ps-state model that includes
the following states: Ps(1s)He(1s1s), Ps(2s)He(1s1s), and Ps(2p)He(1s1s). The Born terms
for the excitation of He are found to be small and are not considered here in the coupled-
channel scheme. First, we present the elastic Ps(1s)He(1s1s) diﬀerential cross section and
inelastic diﬀerential cross sections to Ps(2s)He(1s1s) and Ps(2p)He(1s1s) states at diﬀerent
energies.

In order to show the general trend of the diﬀerential cross sections, we perform cal-
culations at the following incident positronium energies: 20, 30, 40, 60, 80 and 100 eV.
We exhibit the diﬀerential cross sections for elastic scattering at these energies in Fig. 1.
In Figs. 2 − 3 we show the inelastic cross sections for transition to Ps(2s)He(1s1s) and
Ps(2p)He(1s1s) states. From all these ﬁgures we ﬁnd that, as expected, the diﬀerential cross
sections are more isotropic at low energies where only the low partial waves contribute. At
higher energies more and more partial waves are needed to achieve convergence and the
diﬀerential cross sections are more anisotropic. The small oscillation of the diﬀerential cross
sections at larger angles and energies is due to numerical diﬃculties.

Recently, Garner et al. [5] have provided an experimental estimate of average diﬀerential
cross section across the energy range 10 to 100 eV with respect to any process in Ps-He
scattering for forward scattering angles: hdσ/dΩi = (34 ± 12) × 10−20 m2 sr−1 = (121 ± 43)a2
0
sr−1. However, it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between the present
diﬀerential cross sections and the experimental estimate of Garner et al.

We calculate the diﬀerent angle-integrated partial cross sections for Ps-He scattering. In
addition to the Ps(1s,2s,2p) cross sections calculated using the coupled-channel method, we
also calculate the higher Ps(7 > n > 2)-excitation and Ps-ionization cross sections using
the Born approximation with present exchange potential. These results are shown in Fig.
4, where we plot angle-integrated elastic, Ps(n=2) [≡Ps(2s+2p)], inelastic Ps(7 > n > 2),
and Ps ionization cross sections. The total cross section calculated from these partial cross
sections is also shown in this plot and compared with the experiments of Refs. [1,3] and total
cross section of the 22-Ps-state R-matrix calculation of Ref. [8]. The agreement between
theory and experiment is quite good up to 70 eV. The target-inelastic processes ignored in
this work are supposed to play important role at higher energies, which may be the cause
of detorioration of agreement of present results with experiment above 70 eV. There exists
qualitative disagreement between the present total cross section and that of the 22-state
calculation of Ref. [8], on which we comment below.

As the Ps-He system is of fundamental interest to both theoreticians and experimental-
ists, it is appropriate to critically compare our results with other theories and experiments.
The only other recent experiment on Ps-He is the one by Nagashima et al. [4], who obtained
the cross section of (13 ± 4)πa2
0 for an average energy of 0.15 eV in striking disagreement
with the present calculation yielding 2.58πa2
0 at 0.9 eV as well as with the experiment of
Skalsey et al. [3] who obtained (2.61 ± 0.5)πa2
0 at about 0.9 eV.

Independent experiment on the measurement [22] of pick-oﬀ quenching rate of Ps on He
can be used [23] to resolve the stalemate. It is argued [23] that a large low-energy Ps-He
elastic cross section implies a large repulsive exchange potential between Ps and He atoms
in the elastic channel. In the presence of a large repulsive potential it will be diﬃcult for
the Ps atom to approach the He atom. Consequently, one will have a small value for the
pick-oﬀ quenching rate. From a study of the pick-oﬀ quenching rates of diﬀerent models, we
concluded [23] that a small low-energy cross section, as obtained by us, will lead to a large
pick-oﬀ quenching rate in agreement with experiment. The large low-energy cross sections
as obtained in other theoretical models [7,8,10,11] will lead to a much too small pick-oﬀ
quenching rate in disagreement with experiment. This substantiates that the present low-
energy cross section and the experiment of Skalsey et al. [3] are consistent with the pick-oﬀ
quenching rate measurement [22].
It would be diﬃcult to reconcile the low-energy cross
section of Nagashima et al. [4] and other theoretical results [7,8,10,11] with the measurement
of the pick-oﬀ quenching rate.

We note that a model calculation by G. Peach [24], performed before the experiment of
Skalsey et al. [3], is also in reasonable agreement with the present calculation and low energy
experiments. The model of Peach was constructed by ﬁtting to known positron-helium [25]
and electron-helium [26] scattering data.

In Table I we compare the results of the angle-integrated partial cross sections to
Ps(1s,2s,2p) states of diﬀerent theoretical calculations. The present Ps(1s) Born cross sec-
tions are much smaller than the Born-Oppenheimer cross sections [19] used as input to close-
coupling [7] or R-matrix [8] schemes. There have been diﬀerent static-exchange calculations
on Ps-He since the 1960s [7,8,10,11]. These calculations yielded similar results and in the
static-exchange (SE) column of Table I we quote the recent cross sections of Refs. [7,8]. Al-
though these SE cross sections are much smaller than the corresponding Born-Oppenheimer
cross sections, they are much larger than those of the present calculation. The 22-Ps-state

4

R-matrix calculation [8] yields elastic cross sections marginally smaller than the SE cross
sections, and it seems unlikely that the “converged” R-matrix calculation will lead to elastic
cross sections comparable to the present ones. However, the measured pick-oﬀ quenching
rate [22] favors [23] a week exchange potential and small Ps(1s) cross sections at low ener-
gies, and future measurements of low-energy Ps-He elastic cross sections will decide which
of the results are more realistic. Although the present elastic Ps(1) cross sections are much
smaller than those of the R-matrix calculation, the reverse is true for the excitation cross
sections to the Ps(2) states as can be found from Table I. The large Ps-excitation (and Ps
ionization) cross sections of the present calculation and the small low-energy elastic cross
sections are collectively responsible for the construction of the pronounced peak in the total
cross section as in Fig. 4 near 15 − 20 eV in agreement with experiments of Refs. [1] and
[3]. This peak is also present in the calculation of Peach [24] and is clearly absent in the
close-coupling [7] and 22-Ps-state R-matrix analysis [8]. Similar peaks also appear in the
total cross section of Ps-H2 and Ps-Ar scattering [5].

To summarize, we have performed a three-Ps-state coupled-channel calculation of Ps-He
scattering at low and medium energies using a regularized symmetric nonlocal electron-
exchange model potential recently suggested by us and successfully used in other Ps scatter-
ing problems. We present results for diﬀerential cross sections at several incident Ps energies
between 20 eV to 100 eV for elastic scattering and inelastic excitation to Ps(2s,2p)He(1s1s)
states. We also present the angle-integrated partial cross sections and compare them with
those of other calculations. The present total cross sections are in agreement with data of
Refs. [1,3]. However, there is alarming discrepancy between the present cross sections and
those of conventional R-matrix [8] and close-coupling [7] calculations. These latter calcula-
tions are in agreement with a recent measurement of low-energy cross section by Nagashima
et al. [4]. At low energies, the present elastic cross sections are much too smaller compared
to those of Refs. [7,8]. However, the present total cross section develops a pronounced max-
imum near 15 − 20 eV as can be seen in Fig. 4 in agreement with the general experimental
trend [5]. The cross section of Ref. [8] does not have this behavior. Although, comparison
with the pick-oﬀ quenching measurement data [22] at low-energy favors [23] the results of the
present model, further precise measurements of total and Ps(2) excitations at low energies
will ﬁnally resolve the stalemate.

4. Partial and total cross sections (in units of 10−16 cm2) of Ps-He scattering at diﬀerent
Ps energies: Ps(1s) (dashed-triple-dotted line), Ps(n=2) (dashed-dotted line), Ps(7 > n > 2)
(dashed-double-dotted line), Ps-ionization (dashed line), total (full line), total (full line with
crosses from Ref. [8]), and data points with error bars from Refs. [1,3].

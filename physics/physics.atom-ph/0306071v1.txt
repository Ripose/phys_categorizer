Abstract

We report the results of an ab initio relativistic correlation calculation of the eﬀective electric

ﬁeld on the electron in low-lying excited electronic states of PbO, required for the interpretation of

an ongoing experiment at Yale University using this molecule in the search for the electric dipole

moment of the electron. The generalized relativistic eﬀective core potential and relativistic coupled

cluster methods are used, followed by nonvariational one-center restoration of the four-component

wavefunction in the core of the heavy atom. The values of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld acting on the

electron are −3.2 × 1024Hz/(e · cm) for the a(1) state and −9.7 × 1024Hz/(e · cm) for the B(1) state.

The hyperﬁne constant Ak is calculated for the a(1) and B(1) states, and the former is compared

with the known experimental value to provide a check on the accuracy of the method.

Introduction. Following the discovery of the combined CP-parity violation in K0-meson

decay [1], the search for the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron, de, has become

one of the most fundamental problems in physics [2]. Modern experiments searching for de

in diatomic molecules with a heavy atom exploit the fact that the electric ﬁeld seen by an

unpaired electron is greatly enhanced relative to the external ﬁeld [3, 4]. Knowledge of this

eﬀective electric ﬁeld is necessary both for the preparation of the experiment and for the

interpretation of experimental results. For diatomic molecules with one unpaired electron,

such as YbF and BaF, semiempirical estimates or ab initio calculations with approximate

accounting for correlation and relativistic eﬀects provide reasonably reliable results (see Refs.

[5, 6, 7]). These molecules are, however, chemical radicals, and pose therefore experimental

problems. It was pointed out recently that the excited a(1) [8] or B(1) [9] states of the PbO

molecule can be used eﬃciently in the search for de, and the corresponding experiment has

been started at Yale University. High-accuracy ab initio relativistic calculations including

correlation provide the only way for obtaining a reliable value of the eﬀective electric ﬁeld

Wd on the electron in PbO. Since the relevant operator is concentrated near the nucleus

of the heavy atom, the concurrent calculation of experimentally known properties that also

depend on the electronic spin density near the heavy nucleus, such as hyperﬁne constants,

gives a check on the accuracy and reliability of the calculated Wd.

The terms of interest for PbO in the eﬀective spin-rotational Hamiltonian may be written

following Ref. [10]. The P,T-odd interaction of de with the eﬀective electric ﬁeld Wd is given

by

where J is the total electron moment and n is the unit vector along the molecular axis from
Pb to O. The hyperﬁne interaction of the electrons with the 207Pb nucleus is

where ˆA is the hyperﬁne tensor, characterized for a linear molecule by the constants Ak and
A⊥, and I is the spin of the 207Pb nucleus (I = 1/2).

In practice, the eﬀective operator

is used to express the interaction of de with the inner molecular electric ﬁeld E (σ are the

Pauli matrices), to avoid the large terms which cancel each other [11] because of Schiﬀ’s

theorem. After averaging over the electronic coordinates in the molecular wavefunction, one

obtains

where ΨΩ is the wavefunction for either a(1) or B(1), and Ω = hΨΩ|J · n|ΨΩi. The hyperﬁne

where µPb is the magnetic moment of 207Pb, αi are the Dirac matrices for the ith electron,
and ri is its radius-vector in a coordinate system centered on the Pb atom.

Both Ak and Wd depend strongly on the electronic spin density near the heavy nucleus,

while the molecular bonds are formed in the valence region. As shown in a series of papers

(see [5, 13, 14] and references therein), it is possible to evaluate the electronic wavefunction

near the heavy nucleus in two steps. Employing this strategy here, a high-accuracy relativis-

tic coupled cluster (RCC) calculation [15] of the electronic structure of the molecule with

the generalized relativistic eﬀective core potential (GRECP) is carried out ﬁrst, providing

proper electronic density in the valence and outer core regions. This is followed by restora-

tion of the proper shape of the four-component molecular spinors in the inner core region of

the heavy atom.

Methods and calculations. A 22-electron GRECP for Pb [16] is used in the ﬁrst stage

of the two-step calculations of PbO, so that the inner shells of the Pb atom (from 1s to

4f ) are absorbed into the GRECP, and the 5s, 5p, 5d, 6s, and 6p electrons (as well as

the eight oxygen electrons) are treated explicitly. Two series of calculations are carried

out, denoted below as (a) and (b): calculation (a) correlates 10 electrons, freezing the 5s,

5p, 5d shells of Pb and the 1s shell of O; (b) has 30 correlated electrons, including all the
electrons treated explicitly. States with the leading conﬁgurations σ2

enumerating them in order of increasing energy. For each series of calculations, correlation

spin-orbital basis sets are optimized in atomic two-component GRECP/RCC calculations

of Pb. The four 6s and 6p electrons are correlated in the basis set optimization stage of

3

calculation (a), and 22 electrons (from 5s to 6p) are correlated in the optimization of the

basis set used in series (b). Correlation is taken into account at this stage by the RCC

method with single and double cluster amplitudes (RCC-SD) [17]; the average energy of the

ﬁve lowest states of Pb is minimized. The detailed description of the basis set generation

procedure may be found in Refs. [18, 19]. A [4s3p2d] basis, obtained by omitting the f

function from Dunning’s correlation-consistent (10s5p2d1f )/[4s3p2d1f ] basis listed in the

MOLCAS 4.1 library [20], is used for oxygen. We found that the f orbital has little eﬀect

on the core properties calculated here.

PbO calculations start with a one-component SCF computation of the molecular ground

state, using the spin-averaged GRECP (AGREP). The Pb spinors 5s, 5p and 5d are frozen

in the (a) series, using the level-shift technique [21]. An AGREP/RASSCF (restricted-
active-space SCF) calculation [20, 22] of the lowest 3Σ+ state of the PbO molecule is then

performed. In the RASSCF method, orbitals are divided into three active subspaces: RAS1,

with a restricted number of holes allowed; RAS2, where all possible occupations are included;

and RAS3, with an upper limit on the number of electrons.

Diﬀerent distributions of electrons in these active subspaces are used (details on the

active space may be found in [23]) to estimate the diﬀerent correlation contributions to the

RASSCF values of Ak and Wd. Two-component RCC-SD molecular calculations are then

performed. The RASSCF calculations with the AGREP operator take into account only

the most important correlation and scalar-relativistic eﬀects, while the GRECP/RCC-SD

calculations also account for spin-orbit interaction. The Fock-space RCC calculations start

from the ground state of PbO and use the scheme

PbO+ ← PbO → PbO−

Details on the choice of model spaces used in the calculations may be found in [23].

Only valence and outer core electrons have been treated up to this stage. Since we are

interested in properties near the Pb nucleus, the shape of the four-component molecular

spinors has to be restored in the inner core region. All molecular spinors are restored using

the nonvariational one-center restoration scheme (see [5, 14, 21, 24] and references therein).

This is done in two steps:

First, equivalent numerical one-center basis sets of four-component spinors and two-

4

component pseudospinors are generated by the ﬁnite-diﬀerence all-electron Dirac-Hartree-

Fock (DHF) and GRECP/SCF calculations, respectively, of the same valence conﬁgurations

of the Pb atom and its ions.
In the DHF calculations the inner core spinors (1s to 4f)
are frozen after the calculation of Pb2+, and the nucleus is modeled by a uniform charge
distribution within a sphere of radius rnucl = 7.12fm = 1.35 × 10−4a.u. The root mean

square radius of the nucleus is 5.52 fm, in accord with the parameterization of Johnson and
Soﬀ [25], and agrees with the experimental value 5.497 fm for the 207Pb nucleus [26]. A test

calculation showed that taking the experimental value for the root mean square radius and a

Fermi distribution for the nucleus charge changes the results for Ak and Wd by 0.1% or less.

The all-electron four-component HFD [27] and two-component GRECP/HFJ [16, 28] codes

are employed for the basis generation, using the procedure developed in Refs. [18, 19]. The

basis sets generated are [9s14p7d] for series (a) and [6s7p5d] for series (b), with the latter

carefully optimized. These sets are orthogonal to the inner core (see above). They describe

mainly the core region, and are generated independently of the basis set for the molecular

GRECP calculations discussed earlier.

In the second step, the basis of one-center two-component atomic pseudospinors is used

to expand the molecular pseudospinorbitals; these two-component pseudospinors are then

replaced by the equivalent four-component spinors, retaining the expansion coeﬃcients. A

very good description of the wave function in the core region is obtained.

The RCC-SD calculation of Wd and Ak employs the ﬁnite ﬁeld method (see Refs. [29, 30]).

The operator corresponding to the desired property [Eq. (1) or (2)] is multiplied by a small

parameter λ and added to the Hamiltonian. The ﬁrst derivative of the calculated energy

with respect to λ gives the value of the evaluated property. This is strictly correct only at

the limit of vanishing λ, but it is usually possible to ﬁnd a range of the λ values where the

energy is linear in λ and the energy changes are large enough to attain the required precision.

The quadratic dependence of the energy on λ is eliminated in the present calculations by

averaging the components of a given term, a(1) or B(1), with opposite signs of λ.

Results and discussion. Calculated results for the (a) and (b) series are presented in
Table I. The internuclear distance is 2.0 ˚A. The RASSCF calculations use the 22-electron

GRECP for Pb. Twenty of the 30 electrons treated were in the inactive space, and only 10

were correlated. Using the C2v classiﬁcation scheme, 2 A1 orbitals are in RAS1, 6 orbitals

(2 A1, 2 B1, and 2 B2) in RAS2, and 41 (16 A1, 5 A2, 10 B1, and 10 B2) in RAS3. No

more than two holes in RAS1 and two particles in RAS3 are allowed. The basis sets on Pb

are (14s18p16d8f )/[4s7p5d3f ] for the RASSCF and 30-electron RCC-SD calculations and

(15s16p12d9f )/[5s7p4d2f ] for 10-electron RCC-SD. A (10s5p2d)/[4s3p2d] basis was put on

O in all calculations.

We discuss mainly the results for the a(1) state (with the leading conﬁguration σ2

1σ2

2π3

1π1

2),

for which the experimental value of Ak is available (−4113 MHz) [31] and a semiempirical
estimate of |Wd| ≥ 12 × 1024 Hz/(e·cm) was made recently [32]. There are several points to

note: (1) Inclusion of the spin-orbit interaction changes Ak and Wd dramatically, as may be

seen from the diﬀerence between the 10-electron RASSCF and RCC-SD results. (2) The ab

initio value of Wd is four times smaller than the semiempirical estimate [32]. (3) Accounting

for outer core–valence correlation by 30-electron RCC-SD changes Wd by 5% and Ak by

15%, yet the error in the calculated Ak is 25%; calculations on BaF [6] and YbF [7] gave

10% accuracy. (4) Ak is mainly determined by the p wave, whereas Wd mostly comes from

s-p mixing.

The need for including correlation in the PbO molecule for the properties discussed here

can be seen already in the semiempirical model [32]. The leading contribution to the highest

occupied σ2 orbital in this model comes from the Pb 6s atomic orbital, with a weight of

∼0.5 (the corresponding MO LCAO coeﬃcient is ∼0.7). This contradicts the qualitative

analysis of the chemical bond formation, which predicts that the σ2 orbital is mainly formed
from the oxygen 2pσ and lead 6pσ orbitals. The RASSCF calculations of the lowest 3Σ+

state conﬁrm this point, with the weight of the Pb 6s orbital varying between 0.04 for 10

active electrons and 0.1 for 30 active electrons. The orbital weight of oxygen 2pσ is ∼0.5

6

and that of the lead 6pσ is ∼0.1, whereas σ1 consists mainly of the lead 6s orbital, with

negligible contribution from lead 6pσ . Note that the oxygen 2pσ and lead 6pσ orbitals are

not orthogonal to each other; after one-center reexpansion of the oxygen basis functions

on lead (see [13] and Eq. (6) in [14]), the weight of the 6pσ orbital goes up to 0.3. We

expect that such strong admixture of the s-wave to the σ2 orbital would not appear in

the semiempirical model if conﬁgurations describing the correlation of the σ2 electrons were

included in the model space. It is important to add that the lowest virtual σ3 orbital gets

the main contribution from the lead 6pσ (with a weight of about 0.5), and the conﬁgurations

containing this orbital are ﬁrst admixed into the leading conﬁguration of the a(1) state due

to the spin-orbit interaction on Pb.

If the spin-orbit interaction is not taken into account, the s-wave contribution to Ak

and the s, p-wave contributions to Wd is due primarily to correlation of the σ electrons. The

RASSCF calculation indicates (see Table I) that such contributions increase Ak but decrease

Wd, resulting in a sign change for Wd, in agreement with the ﬁnal RCC-SD result (details

may be found in Ref. [33]). Besides, as correlation is expected to have a strong inﬂuence on
the values of Ak and Wd, introducing the SO interaction with the 3Π and 1Π states by just

mixing the corresponding σ and π orbitals may not be satisfactory. All these conclusions

could be reached only after extensive molecular calculations, and the estimates made in

Ref. [32] were important at the ﬁrst stage of the experimental eﬀort.

As may be expected, the accuracy of the calculated Ak and Wd values is lower for such a

complicated system as the excited states of the PbO molecule than for the ground states of

BaF and YbF. The valence electron in the latter molecules is in a σ orbital, with much higher

density near the heavy nucleus than the valence π electrons in PbO. Thus, the s, p, d-waves

on the Pb nucleus are aﬀected more strongly by correlation, and higher-order inclusion of

correlation (triple and quadruple amplitudes in the RCC method) as well as larger basis

sets may be necessary. As pointed out above, Wd is more stable than Ak with respect to

changing the number of correlated electrons, and we expect the accuracy of the calculated

Wd to be better than for Ak. In any case, even a 50% accuracy in the Wd value is quite

satisfactory for the ﬁrst stage of the EDM experiment on PbO.

A detailed analysis of correlation and spin-orbital eﬀects on Ak and Wd in PbO will be

published elsewhere [33]. Unfortunately, the experimentally available Ak of the a(1) state

provides a check on the p wave description only. It would be desirable to measure Ak in

7

some state with an excited σ1-electron, where the s-wave would give the main contribution.

Another accuracy check, using the value of

AkA⊥, is not applicable here, because of

p

experimental diﬃculties in measuring the very small values of A⊥ for diatomic molecules

with total electronic momentum J ≥ 1. Our estimate of the accuracy of the calculated Wd

is therefore not as straightforward as for YbF and BaF [6, 7].

Finally, we would like to note that we identiﬁed the lowest 3Π1 state as B(1) state

according to the ΛS classiﬁcation given in [34]. Conclusive identiﬁcation requires a more

extensive ab initio correlation calculation.

A linear Stark shift in dressed atoms as a signal to measure a nuclear anapole moment

We demonstrate theoretically the existence of a linear dc Stark shift of the individual substates
of an alkali atom in its ground state, dressed by a circularly polarized laser ﬁeld. It arises from the
electroweak nuclear anapole moment violating P but not T. It is characterized by the pseudoscalar
ξk ∧ E · B involving the photon angular momentum and static electric and magnetic ﬁelds. We
derive the relevant left-right asymmetry with its complete signature in a ﬁeld conﬁguration selected
for a precision measurement with cold atom beams. The 3, 3 → 4, 3 Cs transition frequency shift
amounts to 7 µHz for a laser power of ≈ 1 kW at 877 nm, E= 100 kV/cm and B>∼ 0.5 G.

Atomic parity violation has built a bridge between
atomic physics and both particle and nuclear physics [1].
The concept of a nuclear anapole moment [2] may be as-
cribed to toroidal currents [3]. Alternatively, it describes
a chiral distribution of the atomic nucleus magnetization,
i.e. a nuclear helimagnetism, resulting from the parity vi-
olating (PV) nuclear forces exerted inside a stable nucleus
[4]. In a stationary atomic state, as a result of T-reversal
invariance, only the nuclear spin dependent PV interac-
tion discussed here contributes to observable PV eﬀects,
while in forbidden optical transitions the dominating nu-
clear spin-independent PV interaction, associated with
the weak nuclear charge QW , makes the anapole eﬀect
diﬃcult to extract.

Today, there exists only one empirical manifestation
of this nuclear anapole moment, though an important
nuclear property. It arises from PV measurements per-
formed on the highly forbidden 6S-7S Cs transition, yield-
ing electric dipole transition amplitudes, Epv

11ea0, of a slightly diﬀerent magnitude (
2%) for
10−
the two hyperﬁne components ∆F =
1 [5]. The re-
ported result presents signiﬁcant discrepancies with dif-
ferent theoretical predictions and with other manifesta-
tions of the PV nuclear forces [3, 4]. On the experimental
side, it is notoriously diﬃcult to extract such a small frac-
tional diﬀerence from measurements where the control
of systematic eﬀects represents a major task. In short,
there is a clear need for new independent results both in
atomic and nuclear physics. In this latter ﬁeld, new high
precision experiments are already underway, namely the
measurement of the directional gamma-ray asymmetry
d+γ experiment and of the neutron spin
in the n+p
rotation in helium [6]. We suggest here a new atomic
physics approach using a frequency shift measurement in
an atomic fountain or a matter-wave interferometer.

Like previous proposals [7, 8, 9, 10], this project is
well suited to an atom in its ground state, where the ef-
fect of the dominant PV potential due to the weak charge
cancels, but it presents important additional advantages.

First, instead of relying on the left-right asymmetry in
a transition rate, it is based, as in [10], on an energy
shift of the atomic states, and its measurement takes ad-
vantage of the methods developed for the primary 133Cs
standard. This experimental domain and that of atomic
interferometry [11, 12] have now reached an impressive,
continuously improving, level of accuracy. Nowadays, be-
yond their metrological interest, cold atom fountains and
interferometers are becoming undisputable tools, lead-
ing to a wide variety of high precision measurements of
fundamental interest, such as a lower limit on the time
variation of the ﬁne structure constant [13], new tests of
Lorentz invariance (LI) [14], possibly tighter constraints
on the electron EDM [15, 16] and new tests of the Ein-
stein Equivalence Principle [13]. Second, this anapole
shift is both a light shift and a dc linear Stark shift of
the
ground state sublevels, violating P but not
T. It is quadratic in the parity conserving (PC) atom
radiation ﬁeld interaction, and linear in the static inter-
action of the nuclear anapole moment with a dc Stark
ﬁeld. Its physical origin is then totally diﬀerent from the
PV light-shift involved in a project for a measurement
of QW on a single trapped Ba+ ion [17]. In the present
project, one must apply both a static electric ﬁeld and a
strong laser ﬁeld, but its phase is irrelevant. So it is not
necessary to localize the atoms inside a cavity unlike the
case of previous proposals [8, 9].

The nuclear spin-dependent PV interaction is respon-
sible not only for a transition electric dipole but also for a
permanent one in an alkali atom ground state, involving

The condition of adiabatic passage is largely satisﬁed by
the atom-radiation ﬁeld interaction. One might object
that the magnitude chosen for E is large. However, still

In conclusion, we have shown the existence of a lin-
ear atomic Stark shift. with a chiral character providing
a signal for the nuclear anapole moment. We have ex-
hibited a concrete example where several powerful tech-
niques developed recently in atomic physics for high pre-
cision frequency determinations appear as highly valu-
able tools for precise atomic PV measurements. The ef-
fect involved presents a certain similarity with the PV
NMR frequency shifts expected in enantiomer molecules
[24]. The chiral conﬁguration deﬁned by ξk, E, B, is play-
ing here the role of the chiral arrangement of the atoms
inside the molecule, but with the advantage of providing
numerous reversals. Owing to the absence of any contri-
bution due to the weak nuclear charge, one could thus ob-
tain a rather direct measurement of a PV static property
of the nucleus. The method could be extended to other
atoms, in particular to strings of (possibly radioactive)
isotopes and would provide valuable information about
nuclear parity violation.

parameter dI E free of the uncertainties coming from the

4,0 transition is insensitive to
the anapole shift, measurements should be performed on
a ﬁrst-order Zeeman shifted transition, as in the case of
the LI tests [14]. A dual Cs-Rb fountain, already used
for a fundamental physics test [13], could be very helpful,
since frequency comparisons should reduce considerably
the magnetic noise.

Another approach would be to use a cold atom inter-
ferometer. In the case where the wave packets are sepa-
rated and recombined by using a π/2
π/2 sequence
of Raman pulses [12], both paths can be made to cross
two interaction regions having chiralities of opposite signs
(Fig.2). In the phase diﬀerence Φ between the two paths,
it is easily veriﬁed that the Zeeman shift cancels while the
anapole shift contribution doubles. The same property
holds for the calibration signal if η is applied with oppo-
site signs on the two dressing beams. An estimate gives
Φ
1 cut oﬀ by
2 for keeping ΓS as all other parameters the same. Since
no absolute measurements is required, this very speciﬁc
phase shift looks accessible in the present state of the art.

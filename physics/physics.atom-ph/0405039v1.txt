Abstract

Corrections of order α3(Zα)5m to the Lamb shift and corrections of order
α3(Zα)EF to hyperﬁne splitting generated by the insertions of the three-loop
one-particle reducible diagrams with radiative photons in the electron line are
calculated. The calculations are performed in the Yennie gauge.

I. INTRODUCTION

The theory of Lamb shift in light hydrogenlike atoms is rapidly developing. Calcula-
tions of the last corrections which are signiﬁcantly larger than 1 kHz for the 1S state in
hydrogen were completed recently. These are corrections of orders α3(Zα)4m, α(Zα)nm,
and α2(Zα)6m. The previously unknown correction to the Lamb shift of order α3(Zα)4m
is connected with the three-loop contribution to the slope of the Dirac form factor, and
was obtained in [1]. Corrections of orders α(Zα)nm for n = 4, 5, 6 are already well known
perturbatively for some time (see, e.g., review [2]), but relatively large magnitude of the
contributions with n = 6, and high precision of the experimental data [3,4] required calcula-
tion of the corrections of higher order in Zα. All such corrections were obtained numerically
without expansion in Zα [5,6]. Corrections of order α(Zα)6m for higher energy levels were
also calculated recently with high accuracy [7,8]. From the practical point of view the cor-
rections of order α(Zα)nm are no more a signiﬁcant source of theoretical uncertainty for the
Lamb shift, for example for the lowest S and P states in hydrogen these contributions are
now known with uncertainty about 1 Hz.

Another recent success is connected with the corrections of order α2(Zα)6m. The leading
logarithm cubed correction of this order was calculated in the pioneering work [9]. This paper
was followed by a heated discussion about the magnitude of the nonleading logarithmic
contributions of order α2(Zα)6m, and even the magnitude of the leading logarithm cubed
term was put under suspicion (see, e.g., review [2]). The doubts about the magnitude of the
leading logarithm cubed term were put to rest in [10], where all logarithmically enhanced
terms of order α2(Zα)6m were calculated in the Coulomb gauge. Finally, the dominant part
of the nonlogarithmic contribution of order α2(Zα)6m was obtained in [11]. At the present
stage remaining uncertainty of the contributions of order α2(Zα)6m to the Lamb shift is
about 0.9 kHz and 0.1 kHz for the 1S and 2S states in hydrogen, respectively.

The largest still unknown contributions to the Lamb shift in hydrogen are corrections of
order α3(Zα)5m. The magnitude of these corrections can be easily estimated multiplying
the corrections of order α2(Zα)5m [14–16] by an extra factor α/π. As a result of this simple
exercise we see that the corrections of order α3(Zα)5m should be about 1 kHz for the 1S
In [17] we calculated radiative corrections to the Lamb shift of order
state in hydrogen.
α3(Zα)5m and radiative corrections to hyperﬁne splitting of order α3(Zα)EF generated by
the diagrams with insertions of radiative photons and electron polarization loops in the
graphs with two external photons.

Below we calculate in the Yennie gauge corrections of order α3(Zα)5m to the Lamb shift
and corrections of order α3(Zα)EF to hyperﬁne splitting generated by the diagrams in Fig.
1 with insertions of the three-loop one-particle reducible diagrams with radiative photons in
the electron line.

II. FACTORIZED CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE LAMB SHIFT AND HYPERFINE
SPLITTING

A. Skeleton Diagram Contributions

The diagrams for nonrecoil corrections of order α3(Zα)5m to the Lamb shift and cor-
rections of order α3(Zα)EF to hyperﬁne splitting in Fig. 1 can be obtained by three-loop
radiative insertions in the skeleton diagram in Fig. 2. Respective corrections of lower orders
in α generated by one- and two-loop radiative insertions are already well known (see, e.g.,
review [2]). All corrections of order αn(Zα)5m and αn(Zα)EF may be calculated in the
scattering approximation (see, e.g., [13]).

Calculation of all these contributions starts with the skeleton diagram in Fig. 2. Contri-

bution of each of the diagrams in Fig. 1 to the Lamb shift is described by the integral

where m is the electron mass, M is the proton mass, mr = m/(1 + m/M) is the reduced
mass, α is the ﬁne structure constant, Z is the nucleus charge in terms of the electron
charge (Z = 1 for hydrogen and muonium), and
is the magnitude of the dimensionless
momentum of the external photons measured in the units of the electron mass. The function
L(k) describes radiative corrections to the skeleton diagram, and should be calculated for
each particular diagram in Fig. 1.
It is normalized to the contribution of the skeleton
numerator, Lskel(k) = 1. The skeleton contribution to the Lamb shift is infrared divergent.
For some diagrams in Fig. 1 this infrared divergence survives in the Feynman gauge even
after insertion of the factor L(k) which describes radiative insertions. In order to avoid such
spurious infrared divergencies which anyway cancel in the gauge-invariant sets of diagrams
we use infrared safe Yennie gauge for radiative photons in the calculations below.

In this paper we calculated factorized corrections of order α3(Zα)5m to the Lamb shift,
and factorized corrections of order α3(Zα)EF to hyperﬁne splitting generated by the dia-
grams in Fig. 1. Collecting contributions to the Lamb shift in eq.(12), eq.(13), and eq.(14),
we obtain

for the 1S level in hydrogen.

The result in eq.(19) has just the scale we expected on the basis of the general consider-
ations explained in the Introduction, and corrections of this magnitude are phenomenologi-
cally relevant at the current level of the experimental and theoretical accuracy (see, e.g. [2]).
Work on calculation of nonfactorizable contributions is now in progress, and we postpone
discussion of the phenomenological implications of the results in eq.(19) and eq.(20) until
its completion.

Abstract

We present high-precision non-relativistic variational calculations of bound
+ molecular ions in
vibrational-rotational state energies for the H2
each of the lowest electronic states of Σg, Σu, and Πu symmetry. The calcula-
tions are carried out including coupling between Σ and Π states but without
using the Born-Oppenheimer or any adiabatic approximation. Convergence
studies are presented which indicate that the resulting energies for low-lying
13. Our procedure accounts naturally for the
levels are accurate to about 10−
lambda-doubling of the Πu state.

I. INTRODUCTION

+ and D2

There are many calculations of bound energies of the hydrogen molecular ion H2

+ using
the Born-Oppenheimer approximation or various adiabatic approximations and there are a
number of studies that investigate deviations of energies from the Born-Oppenheimer values.
+ in each
The present work is a systematic high precision nonadiabatic1 study of H2
of the lowest electronic states of Σg, Σu, and Πu symmetry carried out using variational
basis sets. It is motivated by recent precise experimental spectroscopy of Rydberg states
of the hydrogen and deuterium molecules that has led to accurate experimental values of
the the electric dipole polarizability of the corresponding molecular ions in their ground
states [1]. These experiments were followed by several papers detailing various nonadiabatic
calculations of the electric dipole polarizability [2–5]. The present paper is the ﬁrst in a
series. We are using the eigenstates studied in the present work in a study of the electric
dipole sum rules for H2

+, including the polarizability.
Several investigators have performed nonadiabatic calculations on the ground electronic
+ since Hunter and Pritchard [6] and Ko los [7] reported the ﬁrst precision calcu-
state of H2
lations. The most accurate calculations used variational basis set methods [8,9], variation-
perturbation methods [10,11], and artiﬁcial channel scattering methods [12,13]. Variational
basis set calculations can be in principle quite accurate but appear to have been applied
only to the lowest-lying eigenvalues of the Σg symmetry. The variation-perturbation and the
artiﬁcial channel methods yield energies for all of the vibration-rotational levels and have
been applied to the states of Σg and Σu symmetry. There are other approaches applied to the
Σg symmetry that have not yet reported precision as great as those mentioned above such
as the adaptive ﬁnite element method [14], the generator coordinate method [15], quantum
Monte Carlo [16] and perturbative approaches [17]. Energy calculations up to 1980 were
reviewed by Bishop and Cheung [18] and a useful, more general review covering up to 1995
can be found in [19].

+ and D2

In this section we derive the Hamiltonian and introduce the basis sets we used. Other
derivations can be found in Refs. [20–23,10,24]. Some of the operators we use were introduced
in those references and Ref. [25]. Our intention is to avoid writing explicit matrix elements
until the last steps and the spirit of the present derivation is closest to the derivations in
Refs. [20,22,26].

In a space-ﬁxed frame and with the center of mass motion removed the Hamiltonian for

the homonuclear one-electron diatomic molecule is

1We would prefer to use the term ‘batic, which we coined to avoid the double negative implied in
nonadiabatic, but clarity must yield to convention.

The electronic (cartesian) coordinates are to be held ﬁxed in the space-ﬁxed frame in carrying
out the derivatives in the gradient operator ∇R appearing in Eq. (1) [27,28].

Following Ref. [29] we introduce the rotational angular momentum R implicitly express-
ing the Hamiltonian in a rotating molecular ﬁxed frame. The nuclear kinetic energy is
written as

where the three spherical polar coordinates comprised of R and the two angles (contained in
the R2 operator of Hrot) contain the information on the orientation of the molecular ﬁxed
frame with respect to the space ﬁxed frame.

Since here we are ignoring electron and nuclear spins, the total angular momentum is
N = R + L, where L is the electronic angular momentum. Using R = N − L, we replace
R2 in Eq. (4) giving

The remainder of the Hamiltonian derivation follows that of, for example [10], and in
this way the Hamiltonian reduces to eﬀective matrix elements that may be evaluated as
integrals over λ, µ, and χ.

B. Basis sets and trial functions

For the electronic states of Σg, Σu and Πu symmetry investigated here we used a basis

set composed of functions of the form [24]

ΦΛp

bc (λ, µ, χ) = (λ2 − 1)|

Λ

/2L|

|

Λ
|b

[α(λ − 1)] exp[− 1

2 α(λ − 1)]P |

Λ
|c (µ) exp(iΛχ),

(18)

with b = 0, ..., B and α a nonlinear parameter. We used values of Λ = −1, 0, and 1. The
values |Λ| = 0 and 1 correspond, respectively, to Σ and Π states. For the symmetry Σg
c = 0, 2, .., 2C and p = g, for the Σu and Πu symmetries c = 1, 3, ..., 2C + 1 and p = u, and
for the Πg symmetry c = 2, 4, ..., 2C + 2 with p = g.

The trial function for a particular set of states speciﬁed by Λ, p, and N has the form

ΨΛpN (λ, µ, χ, R) =

ks[bcd]ΦΛp

bc (λ, µ, χ)χd(R)

S

Xs[bcd]=1

where ΦΛp
bc is given in Eq. (18) and where S = (B +1)(C +1)(D +1). The index s ≡ [bcd] was
ﬁlled in the order [{b, {c, {d}}}], where {b}, for example, indicates a loop over all possible
values of the index b = 0, ..., B. The vibrational basis functions were of the form

χd(R) = (1/R)(γR)(β+1)/2Lβ

d (γR) exp(− 1

2γR),

with d = 0, ..., D. The vibrational state quantum numbers were identiﬁed with levels in the
spectrum resulting from the diagonalization. The eigenvalues approach the exact eigenen-
ergies behaving as expected by the Hylleraas-Undheim theorem [31].

Laguerre polynomials were used in the electronic basis because the integrals involved
could be solved in closed form. Other possibilities explored such as Hermite polynomials did
not oﬀer this advantage. The electronic basis (18) is independent of R and is identical to that
used by Moss and Sadler [24]. The vibrational basis is similar to theirs in functional form,
but we used a diﬀerent nonlinear parameter γ that allowed us to avoid certain expressions
involving hypergeometric series and thereby oﬀered an apparent improvement in speed. We
expect that the accuracy of our vibrational basis is at least equal to that of Moss and Sadler.

III. CALCULATION

Matrix elements of the Hamiltonian over the basis set functions and the overlap be-
tween basis set functions were set up as four-dimensional integrals over λ, µ, χ, and R. The
evaluations reduce to integrals over λ, µ, and R. The eigenvalues were obtained using the
Rayleigh-Ritz method by solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian
and overlap matrices and iteratively varying the nonlinear parameters. Some details on the
integrals and procedures are presented in this section.

A. Evaluation of the integrals

Consider the integrals over λ and over R required for evaluation of the Hamiltonian and
overlap matrix elements. Any integrals containing derivatives were manipulated to eliminate
the derivatives by utilizing

to rewrite each integrand as a linear combination of integrals of the form

where r is an integer, r ≥ 0.

The resulting sets of integrals of form (23), and any other integrals of that form, were
then manipulated to eliminate the powers of λ. This was done by writing the product
xrLa
m(x) as a linear combination of Laguerre polynomials with the same superscript. To
this end, the expression

The integrals involving µ could be performed through simple manipulations of associated

Coupling between states of diﬀerent Λ introduced two problems. The ﬁrst was that in
order to carry out manipulations such as those used above leading to (27), we required
expressions for raising or lowering superscripts by more than unity. Using Eq. (22) we
derived the relation

The second problem was the coupling of diﬀerent γ parameters. By using the same
manipulations as for the λ integral, we reduce the vibrational integral to a linear combination
of functions I, where

I(a, m, n, γi, γj) ≡

which can be reexpressed in terms of the hypergeometric function 2F1 using Eq. (7.414.4) of
Ref. [32] as

where

The hypergeometric series terminates since m ≥ 0 and n ≥ 0. Some additional notes on
evaluating integrals of Laguerre and Legendre polynomials are given in [24]. Maple V was
used to check the evaluation of the matrix elements and it was used to output them into
Fortran code.

B. Numerical procedures

The trial functions (19) have three sectors. They are comprised of two electronic sectors,
labeled by the indices b and c and governed by the nonlinear parameter α, and one vibrational
sector, labeled by the index d and governed by the nonlinear parameters β and γ. In our
calculations each sector was treated separately in optimizing the nonlinear parameters and
in studying convergence as the basis size was increased. The eigenvalues and wave functions
were determined by solution of the secular equation using the lapack routines DSYGV
and DSPGV, part of the math subroutine library dxml. The energy was further minimized
by iteratively varying various nonlinear parameters (using a procedure discussed below)
and rediagonalizing. For small basis set sizes we used a conjugate gradient method and
then minimized by hand and for the larger basis set sizes we used an algorithm similar to
Brent’s [33]. Minimization of α was accomplished with standard algorithms. The optimum
values for the parameters β and γ were more diﬃcult to determine for two reasons. First,
β is integer and the necessarily discrete choices impeded the optimization; furthermore, a
change in β does not correspond to a parabolic change in the value of the energy. Second, the
nonlinear parameters β and γ are intrinsically linked requiring simultaneous minimization.
A general procedure was developed which allowed us to optimize α, β, and γ eﬃciently.
Four steps can be identiﬁed. 1) We ﬁxed β and γ and then α was optimized for a minimum
energy. 2) To minimize on β and γ we ﬁxed β and then minimized on γ. The parameter
β was then varied by a large interval (about 6) and then we minimized again on γ. Some
care was required in selecting what would be the optimum values of γ as false local minima
occasionally appeared. 3) Values of β within the ﬁnal interval were searched for the optimum
value with minimization on γ. 4) After all of the above α was reoptimized with the selected

7

In Figs. 1, 2, and 3 for H2

+ and Figs. 4, 5, and 6 for D2

β and γ. In all cases it was found in step 4) that the value of α was the same as that found
in step 1), an important veriﬁcation of our choice of ﬁnal optimized nonlinear parameters.
Having ﬁxed the nonlinear parameters the basis set size was systematically increased to
obtain precise eigenvalues by expanding each sector separately. Convergence to the ﬁnal
+ the
value was logarithmic.
convergence is demonstrated by plotting the diﬀerence between the energy for a particular
basis set dimension and the energy for a basis set of dimension one unit larger. For each
ﬁgure, we begin with the ﬁnal optimized wave function. The nonlinear parameters are not
changed but the basis set dimension is set to B = 2, then index B is increased with the
others held ﬁxed at their optimized values and the diﬀerence between successive energies is
plotted yielding the curves labeled “B (Electronic)” and similarly for C and D. For the Σu
+ convergence in the vibrational sector is slower than for the Σg and Πu
states of H2
states so we extrapolated to the desired numerical accuracy using linear regression on the
log of the energy diﬀerences. Figures 2 and 5 illustrate the slow convergence but also the
validity of the extrapolation. The basis set dimensions and nonlinear parameters for states
with N = 0 are given in Table I for Σg symmetry in the ﬁrst row under “Type I” and for
Σu symmetry in the ﬁrst row under “Type II”.

+ and D2

For the states with N > 0, the oﬀ-diagonal term Eq. (13) in the Hamiltonian requires
the inclusion of coupling between basis sets of Σ and Π symmetry. Denoting the electronic
basis sets by their value of Λ as |Λi we set up matrix elements of the Hamiltonian using
√2(|+1i + |−1i) and 1
√2(|+1i − |−1i). With it there is only coupling
the rotated basis
between |0i and 1
(|+1i − |−1i). A two by two matrix of matrices was created with the
√2
uncoupled Hamiltonian matrix elements for each basis set as the diagonal elements and the
matrix elements of the coupling term Eq. (13) between the two basis sets as the oﬀ-diagonal
elements. The energies of the states were determined by diagonalization of this matrix,
while the energies corresponding to the uncoupled basis 1
√2 (|+1i + |−1i) were determined
by diagonalization of the uncoupled Hamiltonian. For each state, the non-linear parameters
and basis size were ﬁxed at the values already determined for the minimum energies. Then
the same technique used for the uncoupled energies was applied to the coupled basis sets to
determine non-linear parameters and basis sizes that minimized the energy of the state under
consideration. For example, when trying to determine the Σu, v = 0, N = 1 energy, the Σ
basis set parameters were held ﬁxed at their uncoupled values, and the Π basis set parameters
were changed. The parameters for the coupling basis set were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from
those which minimized the energy in the uncoupled calculations, requiring six specialized
parameters for each state when coupling was considered. The rate of convergence of the
coupling terms is illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8. The energies converge logarithmically as each
sector dimension is increased in turn. To evaluate the contribution of this small oﬀ-diagonal
term to the energy many fewer basis set elements are needed than for the diagonal terms.
The basis set dimensions and nonlinear parameters for states with N > 0 are given in Table I.
For each symmetry there are two rows. The ﬁrst row lists the dimensions and parameters
for the primary symmetry and the second row lists the quantities for the symmetry entering
through the coupling of Eq. (13).

+ and
Tables II and III compare the present calculations of nonadiabatic energies for H2
+ respectively with available precision calculations. In each table the vibration-rotation

D2
eigenvalues for the Σg symmetry are given ﬁrst, followed by those for the Σu symmetry.
For the Σg state the most precise variational basis set calculations are given for H2

+ in
+ in Refs. [34,35,13]. Variation-perturbation calculations have
Refs. [34–36,13] and for D2
+ for all the Σg vibration-
been performed by Wolniewicz and Orlikowski [11] for H2
rotation states but the tabulated results include radiative and relativistic corrections and
can not be compared directly with the present work. Using the artiﬁcial channel approach
Moss carried out extensive nonadiabatic calculations of all the vibrational-rotational states
+ [12] for the Σg states. His results with radiative and relativistic correc-
of H2
tions are in good agreement with Wolniewicz and Orlikowski and he also presented energies
without these corrections. In Tables II and III the various calculations for the v = 0, N = 0,
v = 0, N = 1, and v = 1, N = 0 states are compared to our calculations. Results listed in
Refs. [12,13] are converted from dissociation energies in wavenumbers to atomic units and
combined with the asymptotic energy −Mn/[2(1 + Mn)]. Our results are consistent with
and slightly improve upon the precision of previous calculations.

+ and 7 bound levels for D2

Only a few high-precision calculations are available for the lowest states of Σu symmetry
+. Wolniewicz and Orlikowski used the variation-perturbation method and
for H2
+ and gave energies of the levels with
found 3 bound levels for H2
Σ-Π coupling included. Subsequently, Moss using the artiﬁcial channel method including
Σ-Π coupling found results in agreement with those of Wolniewicz and Orlikowski for both
+ [12]. Our Σu results are compared with these prior calculations in Tables II
H2
and III. For the v = 0, N = 0 and v = 0, N = 1 states our energies are consistent with
+ v = 1, N = 0 state we found
the others and of higher precision. However, for the D2
that a quite large basis set (B = 20, C = 11, D = 36 with α = 15.8, β = 37 and γ = 2.6)
was required to approach the energies given in Refs. [11,12]. Peek [37] showed that in the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation the v = 1, N = 0 vibrational wave function can have
signiﬁcant amplitude at values of R as large as several hundred a0. Our electronic basis set
is not explicitly dependent on R and this may account for the large basis size needed. Other
methods [10–13] are based on coupled channel approaches that may be better at describing
such diﬀuse vibrational states.

+ or D2

There do not appear to be any published nonadiabatic energies for the lowest electronic
+. Probably the most accurate study published
state of Πu symmetry of either H2
+ within the standard
is that of Bishop et al. [38], who investigated the Πu energies of H2
adiabatic approximation [7,39]. In Table IV the present nonadiabatic energies are compared
to Born-Oppenheimer and standard adiabatic energies. The energy calculated in the Born-
Oppenheimer approximation is a lower bound to the true energy while the standard adiabatic
and nonadiabatic energies are upper bounds [40,22]. The standard adiabatic energies were
calculated with the diagonal coupling of Ref. [38] rescaled to a proton mass of 1 836.152 701
and the results diﬀer in the seventh decimal place from the values reported in [38]. The
present nonadiabatic results lie above the Born-Oppenheimer energy but below the standard
adiabatic energy as expected [22].

The energies in Table IV were calculated without the consideration of Eq. (13) leading to

+ and Table VI for D2

one level for each value of N. With the inclusion of the coupling term (13) as described above
in Sec. III B our calculations exhibit lambda-doubling in the eigenvalues of Π symmetry. In
+ calculated eigenvalues for the v = 0 and 1 states with
Table V for H2
N = 1 are presented. For each value of v the ﬁrst row gives the energy of the shifted level
resulting from the diagonalization of the matrix coupling |0i and 1
√2(|+1i − |−1i) and the
second row gives the energy of the other, unshifted, level. The energy diﬀerence between
the two levels is the lambda-doubling.

three basis sectors are ﬁxed at their optimized dimensions for B, C, and D. Then for each sector,
in turn, the index of the basis set B, C, or D, is set back to 2 and the value is increased until the
optimized value of B, C, or D is reached again. Each line represents the log10 of the energy for
the index value n subtracted from the energy for the previous index value. (For sector B we have
omitted the energy E12.)

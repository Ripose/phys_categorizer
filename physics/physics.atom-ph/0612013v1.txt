The eﬀect of noise on the nonlinear photoionization of an atom due to a femtosecond pulse is
investigated in the framework of the stochastic Schr¨odinger equation. A modest amount of white
noise results in an enhancement of the net ionization yield by several orders of magnitude, giving
rise to a form of quantum stochastic resonance. We demonstrate that this eﬀect is preserved if the
white noise is replaced by broadband chaotic light.

The interplay between noise and the nonlinear re-
sponse of a physical system described by classical me-
chanics has led to intriguing eﬀects. A paradigm is
stochastic resonance (SR), whereby a nonlinear system
responds more strongly to coherent subthreshold driv-
ing in the presence of an appropriate amount of noise
[1, 2, 3]. Despite prominent demonstrations of classical
SR in ample variety, only a few quantum mechanical ex-
amples have been studied possibly due to subtle features
of the quantum evolution [3]. The concept of SR in the
quantum domain was originally suggested in the context
of two-level conductance switching of driven mesoscopic
metals [4]. This proposition sparked a number of theoret-
ical studies on quantum stochastic resonance in double-
quantum well structures [5], the so-called incoherent and
coherent SR in driven dissipative spin-boson systems [6],
in the bistable photon-ﬁeld dynamics in micromaser [7],
and in the electron shelving in a single ion [8]. Experi-
ments using NMR spectroscopy of water [9], and a very
recent one in the radiofrequency controlled nanomechan-
ical beam oscillator [10], have established the properties
of quantum SR in two-level systems (TLS). These stud-
ies are mostly restricted to the quantum analog of the
classical double-well dynamics. Yet, they have provided
valuable insight into the noise-induced dynamics of quan-
tum systems.

Following quite a diﬀerent path of research, there is
a rapidly growing activity in the general area of control-
ling quantum phenomena [11]. A common approach to
exercise the control exploits the non-perturbative inter-
play between a purposefully designed optical ﬁeld from
a laser and the target quantum system, such as an atom
or molecule [12]. A fundamental control goal is the ma-
nipulation of atomic and molecular interaction to steer
the quantum system towards a desired state [11, 12]. An
accurate knowledge of the eﬀect of noise on quantum sys-
tems would be very helpful to achieve full control. Their
response to noise has been rarely studied so far [13]. One
may even wonder whether the presence of noise oﬀers
new possibilities of quantum control.

Here, we will demonstrate the existence of a stochas-
tic resonance-like eﬀect in a generic quantum situation

beyond the two-level systems. For this purpose, we con-
sider a quantum system having a ﬁnite binding potential
with mixed, discrete and continuous spectrum which is
coupled to two external forces. First, a nonresonant co-
herent optical driving and, second an incoherent pertur-
bation which may result from some form of environment.
These situations are suﬃciently general to be achieved in
a variety of quantum systems such as in nuclear motion
in diatomic molecules, in Josephson junction devices, and
in active single-electron atoms.

Let us concentrate on the latter example in the form
of the simplest single electron atom, i.e., the hydrogen
atom. Due to the application of a linearly polarized
laser ﬁeld F (t), the electron dynamics is eﬀectively con-
ﬁned to one dimension along the polarization axis. The
Hamiltonian for such a simpliﬁed (yet reliable [14]) de-
scription of the hydrogen atom, which is here also per-
turbed by a stochastic force ξ(t), reads as (atomic units,
¯h = m = e = 1, are used unless stated otherwise)

where x is the position of the electron and ˆp =
i ∂/∂x is the momentum operator. The potential
−
is approximated by a non-singular Coulomb-like form
1/√x2 + a2. Such a soft-core potential with
V (x) =
parameter a has been routinely employed to study atomic
dynamics in strong laser ﬁelds [15].
It successfully
describes many experimental features of multiphoton
or tunnel
ionization [14], and the observation of the
plateau in the higher harmonic generation spectra [15].
The external perturbations (last term in Eq. (1)) is
dipole-coupled to the atom. The laser ﬁeld is a non-
resonant femtosecond pulse (duration 20 optical periods)
described as, F (t) = f (t)F0 sin(ωt + δ). Here f(t) deﬁnes

Due to the stochastic nature of the Hamiltonian, the
quantum evolution is nondeterministic. Thus an averag-

tion from the grid boundary, we employ an absorbing
boundary [17]. The observable, such as the ionization
ﬂux leaking in the continuum on one side, is deﬁned as
JR(xR, t) = Re[Ψ∗ ˆp Ψ]xR, where xR is a distant point
(typically 500 a.u.) near the absorbing boundary. The

First, we will discuss the response of the atom interact-
ing with a short but strong laser pulse only. It produces
(nonlinear) ionization of the atom which is most easily
understood, especially in the time domain, with the pic-
ture of tunneling ionization. Ionization ﬂux is produced
close to those times when the potential is maximally bent
down by the dipole-coupled laser ﬁeld. This is illustrated
in Fig. 1 with the temporal evolution of the ionization
ﬂux for a 20 cycle laser pulse (shown in the top parts of
Fig. 1) with two diﬀerent peak amplitudes F0 = 0.05 a.u.
[Fig. 1(a)] and F0 = 0.02 a.u. [Fig. 1(b)]. Time-resolved
ionization peaks separated by the optical period (2π/ω)
are clearly visible for both peak ﬁeld amplitudes. In ad-
dition, JR(t) shows a complex interference pattern due
to the modulated Coulomb barrier in Fig. 1(a). How-
ever, quite strikingly, if F0 is reduced to 0.02 a.u., the
ionization collapses by around ﬁve orders of magnitude
as shown in Fig. 1(b). One can conclude that the pho-
toionization dynamics is highly nonlinear, and in partic-
ular it exhibits a form of “threshold” dynamics where
the threshold is created by the condition for over barrier
ionization.

Almost nothing is known about the quantum ana-
log of SR in such “threshold-crossing” quantum devices
[2]. Naturally, in the context of SR the question arises

FIG. 1: Nonlinear ionization ﬂux JR(t) (lower part of plots)
induced by a 20 optical cycles laser pulse shown in the respec-
tive upper plots with ω = 0.057, δ = 0 and peak amplitude,
F0 = 0.05 (a), and F0 = 0.02 (b). The pulse envelope f (t)
is unity except single-cycle sinusoidal rising and falling edges.
The threshold for over barrier ionization is Fth = 0.067 a.u..

if noise can recover the strong periodic ionization ﬂux
for the “weak” laser pulse. To answer this question, we
show the ionization ﬂux averaged over 50 realizations in
Fig. 2(a) when a small amount of noise is added to the
weak laser pulse (F0 = 0.02). Note that the noise is
switched on for the same time interval as the 20 cycle
laser pulse. One can see that for very small noise am-
plitude √D = 0.00024, the periodic structure in atomic
ionization gets ampliﬁed by one order of magnitude as
compared to the case of the laser pulse alone [compare
Fig. 1(b) with Fig. 2(a)]. However, one might ask if
such an enhancement could be due to the noise alone.
Contrary to the coherent excitation, the noise alone pro-
duces an, on average, featureless ionization proﬁle [see
Fig. 2]. Here the noise causes ionization from the atomic
ground state, which is diﬀerent from the studied inization
of the Rydberg atoms [18]. This purely stochastic ion-
ization for the feeble noise √D = 0.00024 is considerably
smaller, than the corresponding case of laser pulse with
noise [Fig. 2(a)]. Hence, the observed net enhancement
can be attributed to a nonlinear quantum interaction be-
tween coherent pulse and noise, which is also beyond the
response to a simple quantum addition of the individual
external ﬁelds.

As the noise level is further increased, we observe an
enhancement of the periodic ionization proﬁle by many
orders of magnitude as shown in Fig. 2(b)-(c). However,
the increase in noise level also causes the stochastic ion-
ization curve to rise rapidly. Eventually, for strong noise

amplitude. It exhibits a sharp rise, followed by a maxi-
mum at a certain value of the noise (point B), and then a
gradual fall oﬀ. It is worth mentioning that only a mod-

est noise to laser ratio (
to reach the optimum enhancement (here ηmax = 36), as
indicated by a typical optimal pulse shape in the inset of
Fig. 3.

The enhancement in photoionization can be under-
stood by a simple two-step mechanism. First, starting
from the ground state, the atom absorbs energy from
the noise leading to a Boltzman-like population of energy
levels. In a second step, the laser ﬁeld causes ionization
from the electron wavefunction Boltzmann distributed
over many (excited) states. This simple picture is in-
deed veriﬁed by separating the laser irradiation and the
noise input in time. A sequential application of the noise
followed by the laser pulse leaves the SR curve almost in-
variant. On the contrary, by reversing the sequence, i.e.,
laser pulse ﬁrst and then noise, destroys the SR. Note
that due to the level structure of the atom (many bound
states and continuum) there is no relevant noise induced
time-scale as known from two-level systems. Thus, the
optimum enhancement does not show the characteris-
tic synchronization between coherent and noise induced
time-scales as in the TLS [2, 3]. Indeed, in some classical
systems SR has been shown to exist without any explicit
synchronization requirement [19]. Atomic ionization un-
der a driving laser ﬁeld provides the quantum analog to
synchronization free SR.

It is worth mentioning that the features presented here
are robust with respect to the choice of parameters. For
example, we have observed the quantum SR for pulses
lasting from a few cycles to few hundred cycles, and for

tudes of Fig. 2(a)-(c), respectively. Inset: A typical optimal
pulse for point B with pDopt = 0.0015, F0 = 0.02.

FIG. 2: Ionisation ﬂux for a weak laser pulse F0 = 0.02, with

case, the coherent structures tend to wash out and the
noise dominates the ionization [Fig. 2(c)]. This suggests
the existence of an optimum ratio between the noise and
laser amplitudes which leads to a maximum ionization
enhancement.

To quantify the quantum stochastic enhancement we

and noise, respectively. Although this is diﬀerent com-
pared to the quantiﬁers commonly used [2, 3], η is more

and molecular systems, our results might provide valu-
able insight into the possible role of noise in designing op-
timal quasi-coherent quantum control schemes [11, 21].
Finally, analogous eﬀects are also expected in other sys-
tems such as in photo-fragmentation of anharmonic di-
atomic molecules [22, 23], and in the recently observed
multiphoton transitions in current-biased Josephson de-
vices [24], provided a coupling with an incoherent per-
turbation exists.

FIG. 4: Enhancement induced by a broadband chaotic light.
The peak amplitude and frequency of the 20 cycle laser pulse
are F0 = 0.02 and ω = 0.057, respectively. The bandwidth
of chaotic light is ∆ω = 0.75 with central frequency ω0 =
0.375.
Inset: power spectral density (PSD) of the chaotic
light compared to the one for the white noise.

ω ranging over more than one order of magnitude from
infrared to near UV frequencies.

The intensity required for the white noise renders
an experimental test of our prediction quite challeng-
ing. However, one could think of replacing the white
noise by a quasi-white noise, i.e., chaotic light with a ﬁ-
nite but broad bandwidth ∆ω. This can be realized by
adding a large number (here 1024) of independent phase-
randomized frequency modes. The inset of Fig. 4 shows
an example of a characteristic spectral density of such a
broadband source having ∆ω = 20 eV (0.75 a.u.). Mod-
ern pulse shaping techniques can generate chaotic light
pulses with a bandwidth as large as 30 eV [20, 21]. In
Fig. 4 we have plotted η deﬁned in Eq. (4) vs the rms
amplitude of the chaotic light (analogous to the noise
amplitude) for the previously used coherent pulse. One
can see that such chaotic light can preserve the features
of quantum SR, with an almost identical optimum com-
pared to the one for the white noise case of Fig. 3. This
observation may creat new possibilities in quasi-coherent
control schemes of similar quantum systems.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new form of
quantum stochastic resonance in the dynamics of the
simplest atomic system for the ﬁrst time. This gener-
alized quantum SR leads to a dramatic enhancement (by
several orders of magnitude) in the nonlinear ionization
when a modest amount of optimum white noise is added
to the weak few cycle laser pulse. The same eﬀect is also
achieved if one uses (realizable) broadband chaotic light
instead of white noise. We emphasize that the eﬀet is
robust with respect to a range of experimentally accessi-
ble parameters. In addition to substantially broadening
the existing paradigm for quantum SR to generic atomic

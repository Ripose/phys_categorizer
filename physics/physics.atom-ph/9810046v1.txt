Connection of Lyapunov exponent and transport coeﬃcients

Klaus Morawetz
Fachbereich Physik, University Rostock, D-18055 Rostock, Germany

Within the frame of kinetic theory a response function is derived which includes dissipation within
relaxation time approximation and a contribution from chaotic processes characterized by the Lya-
punov exponent. A generalized local density approximation is presented including the eﬀect of many
particle relaxation and additional chaotic scattering. For small Lyapunov exponents relative to the
product of wave vector and Fermi velocity in the system, the Lyapunov exponent is equivalent to a
relaxation time in the response function. Therefore the transport coeﬃcients can be connected with
the largest positive Lyapunov exponent in the same way as known from the transport theory within
relaxation time approximation.

The problem of irreversibility is one of the still open
questions. Two approaches basically can be distinct. One
approach considers the many particle theory as a suitable
starting point to understand the increase of entropy as
a result of many random collisions leading to irreversible
kinetic equations like the Boltzmann equation. The other
approach considers the theory of deterministic chaos with
the characteristic measure of Lyapunov exponent to be
the relevant theory to understand the occurrence of ir-
reversibility. While the many particle approach can be
easily extend to quantum systems the quantum chaos is
still a matter of debate on the correct term.

If both approaches, what we will anticipate in the fol-
lowing, describe some facettes of irreversibility, it should
be possible to give relations between them. While the
characteristic measure of many body eﬀects are the re-
laxation and the transport coeﬃcients, the relevant mea-
sure for chaotic systems is the Lyapunov exponent as a
measure of phase space spreading of trajectories. Con-
siderable eﬀorts has been made to connect the trans-
port coeﬃcients with the Lyapunov exponent [1–4]. In
[1,4] the fact, that the spreading of a small phase space
volume is given by the sum of Lyapunov exponents
δV (t) = δV (0) exp (
λi)t, is used to give a relation be-
tween Lyapunov exponents an viscosity. This was possi-
ble to show with the help of a contact to a heat bath in the
equation of motion such that the internal energy is kept
constant. In [2,3] the relation between transport coeﬃ-
cients and Lyapunov exponents where presented in terms
of Helfand’s moments. There the interlink was possible
to establish by reinterpretation of the Helfand’s moments
as stochastic quantities such that the mean variance of
the time derivatives represent just the transport coeﬃ-
cients.

P

However, there exists a very simple connection between
the concept of Lyapunov exponent and the dissipation
leading to irreversibility for interacting Fermi systems.
This will be demonstrated in this letter. It will be shown
that if the largest positive Lyapunov exponents is smaller
than the product of Fermi velocity times wavelength in
a Fermi system, the Lyapunov exponent is equal to the

relaxation time of the system. Therefore all expressions
known from kinetic theory, expressing the transport co-
eﬃcients in terms of the relaxation time, can be taken
over as an expression of the Lyapunov exponent.

The concept of response of an interacting many body
system starts from the quasiclassical distribution func-
tion f (p, r, t) satisfying the kinetic equation

∂rf (p, r, t) − ∂rV ∂pf (p, r, t)

with the self-consistent mean-ﬁeld potential V and a typ-

Introducing the Lagrange picture by following the tra-
jectory x(t), p(t) of a particle, we linearize the kinetic
equation equation (1) according to f (x, p, t) = f0(x, p) +
δf (x, p, t)e−t/τ as

This formula represents the ideal free part and a contri-
bution which arises by the trajectories x(t) averaged over
the direction at the present time ~nppf = m ˙~x(0). In prin-
ciple, the knowledge of the evolution of all trajectories
is necessary to evaluate this formula. Molecular dynam-
ical simulations can perform this task but it requires an
astronomical amount of memory to store all trajectories.
Rather, we discuss two approximations which will give
us more insight into the physical processes behind. First
the radical one shows how the local density approxima-
tion emerges. In the next one we consider the inﬂuence
of chaotic scattering.

The local density approximation appears from (7)

Now we focus on the inﬂuence of an additional chaotic
scattering which will be caused e.g. by the curved sur-
face.
In order to investigate this eﬀect we add to the
regular motion (9) a small irregular part ∆x

The irregular part of the motion we specify in the direc-

by an exponential increase in phase-space controlled by
the Lyapunov exponent λ. Therefore we can assume

(14)

Since we are looking for the upper bound of Lyapunov
exponent we can take (14) at the maximum ∆t = −1/λ.
Further, we require, that in the case of vanishing Lya-
punov exponent we should regain the regular motion (9).

which for λ → 0 resembles exactly (10). The further
integration could be given in terms of hypergeometric
functions but this is omitted here.

With this formula we have derived the main result of a
polarization function due to many particle eﬀects includ-
ing the inﬂuence of an additional chaotic process charac-
terized by the Lyapunov exponent λ.

We obtain by this way just the known Matthiessen rule
which states that the damping mechanisms are additive
in the damping Γ = Γcoll + Γchaos.

We like to point out that this result has far reaching
consequences. With the assumption (17) we have shown
by this way that the linear response behavior is the same
if dissipation comes from the relaxation time via collision
processes in many - particle theories or from the concept
of chaotic processes characterized by the Lyapunov ex-
ponent. We can therefore state that for small Lyapunov
exponent compared to the product of wave length and
Fermi velocity in a many particle system, the Lyapunov
exponent behaves like the relaxation time in the response
function.

Since the transport theory is well worked out to cal-
culated the transport coeﬃcients in relaxation time ap-
proximation we can express by this way the transport co-
eﬃcients by the Lyapunov exponent alternatively. This
illustrates the mutual equivalence of the concept of Lya-
punov exponent and dissipative processes in many parti-
cle theories.

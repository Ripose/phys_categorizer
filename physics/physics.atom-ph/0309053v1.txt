In this paper we investigate the eﬀective scattering length a of spin-polarized Ne∗. Due to its
anisotropic electrostatic interaction, its scattering length is determined by ﬁve interaction potentials
instead of one, even in the spin-polarized case, a unique property among the Bose condensed species
and candidates. Because the interaction potentials of Ne∗ are not known accurately enough to
predict the value of the scattering length, we investigate the behavior of a as a function of the ﬁve
phase integrals ΦΩ corresponding to the ﬁve interaction potentials. We ﬁnd that the scattering length
has ﬁve resonances instead of only one and cannot be described by a simple gas-kinetic approach or
the DIS approximation. However, the probability for ﬁnding a positive or large value of the scattering
length is not enhanced compared to the single potential case. The complex behavior of a is studied by
comparing a quantum mechanical ﬁve-channel numerical calculation to simpler two-channel models.
We ﬁnd that the induced dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for coupling between the diﬀerent
|JΩP MP i states, resulting in an inhomogeneous shift of the resonance positions and widths in the
quantum mechanical calculation as compared to the DIS approach. The dependence of the resonance
positions and widths on the input potentials turns out to be rather straightforward. The existence
∗
of two bosonic isotopes of Ne
enables us to choose the isotope with the most favorable scattering
length for eﬃcient evaporative cooling towards the Bose-Einstein Condensation transition, greatly
enhancing the feasibility to reach this transition.

I. INTRODUCTION

Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) has been observed in cold dilute samples of ground state alkali atoms [1,2,3,4]
and atomic hydrogen [5,6]. In 2001, the ﬁrst condensate of atoms in an electronically excited state was obtained
for metastable He[(1s)(2s)3S1] [7,8], referred to as He∗. All these systems have an electron conﬁguration with only
s-electrons in their open shells in common, resulting in an isotropic electrostatic interaction.

The other candidate for achieving BEC with atoms in an electronically excited state is metastable Ne[(2p)5(3s) 3P2],
referred to as Ne∗ in this paper. Two groups are pursuing this goal: the group of Ertmer in Hannover [9] and our
group [10]. Metastable neon is unique among these species in that its binary electrostatic interaction is anisotropic,
due to its (2p)−1 core hole [11].

Crucial in reaching the BEC phase transition is a large ratio of “good” to “bad” collisions, i.e., a large value of
the elastic collision rate characterized by the total cross section σ = 8πa2 for elastic collisions with a the scattering
length, and a small rate for inelastic collisions and other loss processes. In addition, the creation of a stable BEC
requires a positive value of the scattering length. For metastable rare gas atoms, such as He∗ and Ne∗, the major
loss process is Penning ionization in binary collisions. Fortunately, the latter process is suppressed in a sample of
spin-polarized atoms [11]. For He∗, the suppression is very eﬃcient: only spin ﬂips due to magnetic interactions result
in some residual ionization. Theoretical predictions and recent experimental data on residual ionization are in good
agreement [12,13,14,15].

For Ne∗, the anisotropy in the electrostatic interaction determines the magnitude of the residual ionization in a
spin-polarized gas and has a profound inﬂuence on the value of the scattering length. Theoretical estimates of the rate
constant βpol for residual ionization of Ne∗ predict a suppression of ionization by a factor in the range of 10
1000
[11,16], depending on the details of the interaction potentials. In experiments in Hannover and Eindhoven, a lower
limit on the suppression of ionization by a factor of 10 has been conﬁrmed, but so far no conclusive experimental data
on the residual ionization rate of Ne∗ are available.

In addition, the anisotropy in the interaction results in diﬀerent interaction potentials VΩ for the molecular states
of the colliding Ne∗ atoms, with Ω the absolute value of the projection of the total electronic angular momentum

J=4 and Ω = 0 through 4, depending on the relative orientation of the atoms during the collision. This is illustrated
in Fig.1, which shows two colliding atoms in the Ω = 0 and Ω = 4 state, respectively, with the electronic angular
momentum j1,2 and the (2p)−1 orbital of the core hole indicated schematically.

Because the scattering length is determined by the phase integral of the interaction potential, these diﬀerent
potentials VΩ for Ne∗ correspond to diﬀerent scattering lengths aΩ. Since there is no preference for a certain relative
orientation of the atoms (or Ω state) during the collision, even for spin-polarized Ne∗, the elastic collision cross section
will be determined by an eﬀective overall scattering length a, incorporating the behavior of all ﬁve Ω states involved.
Among the species where Bose-Einstein condensation has been achieved, the BEC candidate Ne∗ thus has a unique
property.

In this paper we investigate the relation between the eﬀective overall scattering length a and the phase integrals
ΦΩ of the potentials VΩ. Although the potentials of Ne∗ are unknown at the level of accuracy needed to predict the
value of the scattering length, it is useful to investigate the behavior of the eﬀective scattering length as a function of
the average value of the phase integral. In the following, we will refer to the eﬀective overall scattering length simply
as scattering length.

A better understanding of the complex scattering length of Ne∗ is crucial in determining the feasibility of achieving
BEC with Ne∗. Important questions that need to be answered to determine the feasibility for achieving BEC are:
(1) Is there a larger probability of encountering positive values of the scattering length, as compared to the 75%
probability for the single potential case? (2) What is the probability for ﬁnding a suﬃciently large elastic total cross
section for eﬃcient evaporative cooling? (3) How does the availability of two bosonic isotopes of Ne∗, 20Ne∗ and 22Ne∗
(with a natural abundance of 90 % and 10 %, respectively) inﬂuence these chances?

The values of the rate constant for residual ionization βpol and the scattering length a which we need to achieve BEC
with Ne∗ for typical experimental conditions in our experiment, are summarized in Fig. 2. This so-called feasibility
plot for achieving BEC with Ne∗ shows the calculated number of atoms Nc with which quantum degeneracy is achieved
as a function of βpol and the absolute value of the scattering length

. The calculation of this feasibility plot is based

on the kinetic model of Luiten et al [17], including trap losses. The criterion for crossing the BEC transition has been

As a ﬁrst order estimate, in a simple gas-kinetic picture, one might expect the eﬀective elastic total cross section
σ, referred to as elastic cross section in the remainder of this paper, to be a weighted average over the elastic cross
sections σΩ = 8πa2
Ω of the diﬀerent molecular states. Applying this approach to the anisotropic Ne∗ problem results in
a large enhancement of the probability of encountering large values of σ as compared to all systems with an isotropic
interaction potential. Moreover, the elastic cross section is always larger than a rather large lower limit.

A more sophisticated approach can be found in the Degenerate Internal State (DIS) method [23]. In this method,
the energy splitting of the internal states is neglected and a is given by the weighted average of the contributing
scattering lengths aΩ. For cold collisions of hydrogen atoms, the DIS method results in values for the scattering
length that compare well to the outcome of full quantum calculations [18,19].

The deﬁnitive approach to determine the scattering length a of Ne∗, of course, is a full ﬁve-channel quantum-
mechanical calculation. Although this numerical approach supplies the correct answer to our problem, it has the
disadvantage that the results are not always easy to understand in terms of the properties of the input potentials. We
use the results of the numerical calculation to check the validity of the diﬀerent analytical approximations described
above, which in general give more insight. Moreover, to understand the complex behavior of the scattering length
of Ne∗, we compare the numerical results to a simple analytical model of two coupled square-well potentials with
diﬀerent well-depths.

The numerical results are given in Table I for both bosonic isotopes 20Ne∗ and 22Ne∗. We see that the diﬀerent
ΦΩ′ = 0.8 π. This implies both
Ω-states have very diﬀerent values of ΦΩ, varying by as much as ∆ΦΩ,Ω′ = ΦΩ −
a diﬀerent number of bound states and diﬀerent positions of the resonances in aΩ. Asymptotic behavior of, or a
resonance in the scattering length occurs when a quasi-bound state lies close to the dissociation limit or has just
moved into the continuum.

Because the interaction potentials of neon are not known accurately enough to predict a, we have to vary ΦΩ over
a range equal to π to predict the range of a values that we can expect for the spin-polarized Ne∗ system. Therefore,
we introduce a scanning parameter φ that we add to ΦΩ to create a modiﬁed phase integral φΩ according to

[0, π].

∈

For simplicity, we assume for now that the phase diﬀerences between the Ω potentials ∆ΦΩ,Ω′ are constant and
equal to the ab-initio values given in Table I. Later on in Sec. IV and V, we will also vary ∆ΦΩ,Ω′ over an interval π
to investigate the inﬂuence of ∆ΦΩ,Ω′ on the scattering length a.

The classical phase integrals of the two bosonic isotopes of Ne∗ are related by the mass scaling rule

φΩ = ΦΩ + φ,

22φΩ = (22/20)1/2 20φΩ.

Using the average phase integral over all Ω states
iΩ = 16.5 π, we ﬁnd an isotope shift equal to 0.81 π. This simple
relation between the phase integrals of 20Ne∗ and 22Ne∗ enables us to compare very easily the results obtained for
20Ne∗ with those for 22Ne∗.

In Fig. 3 we show the results for the elastic cross section of 20Ne∗ (solid lines) and 22Ne∗ (broken lines) as a function
[0, π] (Eq. 2). Two important characteristics in the elastic cross section of Ne∗ immediately catch the eye.
of φ
First, we see a rather large minimum value σmin for the elastic cross section and an increase of almost a factor of two
in the probability Pc that the elastic cross section is large enough to make BEC of Ne∗ feasible as compared to the
single potential case, as can be seen in Table II.

p

Secondly, we see ﬁve resonances in σ, attributable to the ﬁve diﬀerent Ω-states of Ne∗. This characteristic behavior
does not depend very much on the speciﬁc values of ∆ΦΩ,0 as long as they are not very small (
0.05 π). This
behavior is very diﬀerent from the single potential case, where we can encounter an elastic cross section equal to zero
and there exists only one resonance.

≤

The general picture is the same for both isotopes. However, the elastic cross section of 22Ne∗ is shifted with respect
to the elastic cross section of 20Ne∗ by the isotope shift of 0.81 π. Depending on the actual phase integral φΩ of the
20Ne∗ system, it can thus be advantageous to switch to the less abundant bosonic isotope 22Ne∗, to optimize the value
of the elastic cross section. Choosing for each value of φ the isotope with the largest σ yields an even larger minimum
value of σ, as can be seen in Table II. In addition, Pc increases from 78 % in the single isotope case to 99 % for either
isotope.

Next, we investigate the scattering length in the DIS approximation, which has proven to be quite insightful for
hydrogen [18,19]. In this approach, the energy splitting of the internal states is neglected. For Ne∗, this means that
the rotational splitting ∆Vrot between the partial waves is neglected. In the DIS approximation, the scattering length
is given by a weighted average of the ﬁve aΩ’s involved [19]

Figure 4 shows the scattering length a as a function of the scanning parameter φ

[0, π]. Again we observe ﬁve
resonances in the scattering length. In this ﬁgure we have also plotted the behavior of the single potential scattering
length aΩ=4 (broken line), showing clearly that the single potential resonance positions coincide with the resonance
positions of a in the DIS approach.

∈

Taking the weighted average of aΩ does not change the total probability for a positive scattering length (75 %) as
compared to the single potential case (Sec. III A). However, the probability of encountering a large value of a does
increase, as can be seen in Table II. Both the width of the resonances (Eq. 5) and the derivative ∂a/∂φ of a with
respect to φ determine this probability. From Figure 4 it is clear that the total width Γ of all ﬁve resonances combined
is much larger than the single potential resonance width. The width of each resonance is not only determined by the
relative weight wΩ of its single potential scattering length but also by its relative position φres
Ω in respect to the other
resonances, and therefore depends sensitively on the phase diﬀerences ∆ΦΩ,Ω′ between the potentials. An increased
width and derivative of a in the DIS approach as compared to the single potential case therefore lead to a much larger
Pc (Table II). Choosing the most advantageous bosonic isotope improves again σmin and Pc as well as the probability
for encountering a positive value of a (95 %) as compared to the single isotope case (Table II).

IV. QUANTUM MECHANICAL NUMERICAL CALCULATION

A. Model

For the Ne∗ system, we can distinguish two regions of interest in the potentials VΩ(R) (Fig. 5). At small internuclear
separations (region I), i.e. R < Rs, the splitting ∆VΩ,Ω′ (R) between the interaction potentials VΩ is larger than the
diﬀerential rotational coupling ∆Vrot(R). As a result, there is no coupling between diﬀerent Ω states but coupling
basis is the proper

representation. Here MP is the projection of P on the quantization axis. Both P and MP are conserved during the
collision. In a semiclassical picture we can describe this regime in the following way. The large Ω-splitting results in
a rapid precession of ~J about the internuclear axis, much faster than the rotation of the axis itself as determined by
. The projection of ~J on the internuclear axis is thus conserved, while the magnitude of ~l changes due

At large internuclear separations (region II in Fig. 5), i.e. R > Rs, the rotational coupling dominates the interaction:
the splitting ∆VΩ,Ω′ (R) is smaller than the diﬀerential rotational coupling Vrot(R). The relative motion of the colliding
atoms results in a rotation of the internuclear axis with respect to ~J and therefore in a change in the value of Ω (Fig.1).

In our calculations we assume that the intermediate region, where Vrot(R) and VΩ,Ω′ (R) are of the same order
of magnitude, is arbitrarily small, i.e., we assume a sudden transition from region I to region II at R = Rs. The
scattering problem now reduces to potential scattering and we can solve the uncoupled problem in region I in the

B. Results

Using the ab-initio potentials of section II we have calculated the scattering length of 20Ne∗ using the quantum
mechanical calculation described in section IV A. Again, we have performed these calculations for φ
[0, π], to
determine the range of scattering length and elastic cross section values that we can expect for the Ne∗ system.
Figure 6 shows the scattering length a (solid line) as a function of φ. For comparison, we have included the result for
a obtained with the DIS model (broken line) (Subsec. III C), in which the positions of the resonances in a correspond
to the single potential resonance positions in aΩ. The resonance positions φres
Ω of a are shifted in an inhomogeneous
way with respect to those obtained with the DIS method and also the widths ΓΩ of the individual resonances diﬀer
signiﬁcantly. We can no longer attach an Ω-label to each of the resonances, as is possible in the DIS approach. In
the DIS model, we neglect the rotational splitting Vrot between the partial waves, so that eﬀectively all partial waves
are equivalent. Apparently, both the resonance positions as well as the widths of the individual resonances in the
numerical results for a are inﬂuenced by the coupling to higher order partial waves. This is not surprising: close lying
bound states from other Ω-potentials will most likely shift the bound state and thus the corresponding resonance
position.

∈

However, despite these qualitative diﬀerences in the behavior of a, the quantitative behavior is the same as in the
single potential case. The probabilities for encountering a positive a value and an elastic cross section σc are equal
to those found in the single potential case (Table II). Although the total width of the resonances is larger, this is
compensated by a decrease in the derivative of a. Moreover, choosing the most advantageous bosonic isotope for each
value of the scanning parameter φ leads to a similar increase in these values for both the full quantum mechanical
calculation as the single potential case.

To investigate the inﬂuence of ∆ΦΩ,Ω′ on the positions of the resonances in a, we have varied the classical phase
diﬀerence ∆Φ4,0 of one of the Ω potentials (Ω = 4), while keeping the other classical phase diﬀerences ﬁxed at their
ab-initio value (Table I). Starting at its ab-initio value, the classical phase diﬀerence

encounter the bound states in all other Ω potentials. The position of the resonances φres

At this point, we do not have a simple explanation for the shift in resonance positions when varying the location of

of the scattering length a as a function of the phase integral φΩ cannot be very easily related to the properties of the
input potentials in this ﬁve-channel system. To obtain more insight into the positions and widths of the resonances
in a, we will investigate simpler two-channel problems.

Rs. The classical phase integral is equal to

Analogous to our quantum mechanical calculation in Sec. IV B, we vary the classical phase diﬀerence ∆φ1,0 =
∆Φ1,0 + ∆φ over the range [
0.61π, 0.39π] starting at its ab-initio value, to investigate the inﬂuence of the input
potentials on the behavior of a. By scanning the parameter φ in the phase integral φΩ (Eq. 2) over the range [0, π],
we then determine the position φres

Ω of the resonances in a for diﬀerent values of ∆φ1,0.

Figure 8 shows the phase integrals φres

Ω for which a resonance in a occurs as a function of ∆φ both for our simple
analytical two-channel model (solid line) and the DIS model (broken line) with equal ΦΩ (e.g. ΦR>Rs
= 0 because
C6 = 0). We see that when the two resonances threaten to overlap at ∆φ = 0.61 π, corresponding to ∆φ1,0 = nπ
(with n = 0, 1, ..), an ‘avoided crossing’ occurs, due to interference between the two resonances. Apart from this
avoided crossing, the positions of the resonances φres
Ω coincide with those in the DIS model and can be labelled by an
Ω state. Or in other words, the quasi-bound states of the system are the
states. Apparently, this model is
incomplete and cannot explain the inhomogeneous shift in the resonance positions of a obtained with the full quantum
mechanical calculation as compared to those obtained with the DIS model. We therefore take a closer look at the
two-channel quantum mechanical numerical solution in the next Subsec.

B. Numerical calculation

Here we discuss a two-channel, i.e. J = 1, quantum-mechanical numerical calculation of a, and compare the results
to the results of the analytical model (Sec. V A) and the full ﬁve-channel quantum mechanical calculation (Sec. IV B).
In the same way as described in Sec. V A we investigate the position of the resonances by varying ∆φ1,0.

In Figure 9 we have plotted the phase integrals φres

Ω at which a resonance in a occurs as a function of ∆φ. There
are broad avoided crossing between the two resonances at ∆φ = 0.1π + nπ, with n = 0, 1, ... Overall, both resonances

0.02)π, while the distance between the resonances remains
approximately constant (except for the avoided crossings) at a value of approximately 0.5 π. We can no longer attach

Figure 10 shows the width of each resonance as a function of ∆φ. The total width of both resonances combined
Γ = Γ0 + Γ1 is conserved, but one resonance is wide while the other is narrow. The width of the resonances ΓΩ varies
as a sine (broken line) between 0 and Γ. At the avoided crossings the widths of the resonances become equal. This
behavior of φres
Ω is very diﬀerent from that obtained in our analytical model (Sec. V A), where one of the resonance
positions remains constant and the other varies directly proportional to ∆φ.
In our analytical model, we do not
take into account the induced dipole-dipole interaction. Therefore, we have investigated the inﬂuence of the induced
dipole-dipole interaction on the behavior of φres
Ω .

For a vanishing value of C6, simulated by assuming a modiﬁed value C′

6 = C6/100, the results of the numerical J = 1
calculation show the same qualitative behavior as the results of the analytical model. In addition, the width of the
resonances is greatly reduced. Clearly, the induced dipole-dipole interaction is responsible for the coupling between
the diﬀerent Ω states, resulting in quasi-bound states that are no longer diagonal in
but a superposition
states. This can be understood in the following way. With a decreasing dipole-dipole interaction the
of
rotational energy barrier increases both in height and width. As a result, the region around Rs in which rotational
coupling between the diﬀerent Ω states takes place decreases and eventually vanishes. The quasi-bound states are
pure
states in the presence of the
induced dipole-dipole interaction. Therefore, both resonance positions vary when ∆φ1,0 is varied. With changing
φres
Ω , the coupling of each quasi-bound state to the incoming l = 0 channel changes periodically, resulting in the
periodic change in ΓΩ (Fig. 10). The strong coupling between the Ω states leads to broad resonances and broad
avoided crossing between the two resonances.

With the full ﬁve-channel quantum mechanical calculation, e.g. J = 4 (Sec. IV B), we ﬁnd that two resonances

is consistent with the numerical two-channel model: their widths vary as a sine between a vanishing and large value,
so that the total width is constant. And at the avoided crossing, the widths of the resonances equal each other.

VI. CONCLUDING REMARKS

Elastic collisions between spin-polarized Ne∗ atoms are governed by multiple interaction potentials. This unique
property of Ne∗ among the BEC species and candidates is a result of the anisotropic interaction between them. Both
simple analytical and full quantum mechanical calculations of the scattering length a of Ne∗ show that the resulting
scattering length has ﬁve resonances. A simple gas-kinetic picture yields very favorable but not very realistic results
(since they are not compatible with the numerical calculations) for the elastic collision cross section. Comparison
between the numerical results and the DIS model reveals that a is also not simply a weighted average over the single
potential resonances aΩ and that the resonances in a cannot be assigned to a single Ω state. However, the overall
behavior of a is similar to that of the usual single potential scattering length: neither the probability for encountering
a positive or a large value of a is enhanced by the presence of ﬁve instead of one resonances.

In order to obtain more insight in the behavior of the complex scattering length of Ne∗, we have compared the full
quantum mechanical calculation to a simple two-channel analytical and numerical calculation. From these simpler
models we have learned that the presence of an induced dipole-dipole interaction leads to strong coupling between
the diﬀerent Ω states and causes a broadening of the resonances, resulting in quasi-bound states that are a linear
combination of diﬀerent
states in turn leads to the
states. This coupling between the diﬀerent
inhomogeneous shift of the resonance positions and widths in the quantum mechanical calculation as compared to
the DIS approach. However, the dependence of the resonance positions and widths on the input potentials is quite
straightforward. The resonance positions vary either directly proportional to the relative phase diﬀerences between
the Ω potentials or not at all, depending on the exact composition of its quasi-bound state. The width of the strongly
coupled resonances (whose positions vary
∆φ) is determined by the coupling to the ingoing channel, which varies
periodically with ∆φ. The width of the weakly coupled resonances (whose positions do not vary with ∆φ) is constant,
since the coupling to the ingoing channel does not change. The total change in all ﬁve resonance positions is always
equal to

∆φ and the total width is conserved.

The possibility to choose between the two bosonic isotopes of Ne∗ to optimize the value of the elastic cross section,
greatly enhances the prospects for achieving BEC with Ne∗ (Table II). Large beam ﬂuxes of both bosonic isotopes,
crucial in obtaining favorable initial conditions for eﬃcient evaporative cooling, have been realized at the Eindhoven
experiment [26], therefore choosing the isotope with the most favorable scattering length is feasible.

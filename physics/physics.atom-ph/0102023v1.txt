ABSTRACT

We study numerically the interaction between an intense circularly polarized laser ﬁeld and an
electron moving in a potential which has a discrete cylindrical symmetry with respect to the laser
pulse propagation direction. This setup serves as a simple model, e.g., for benzene and other
aromatic compounds. From general symmetry considerations, within a Floquet approach, selection
rules for the harmonic generation [O. Alon et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 80 3743 (1998)] have been
derived recently. Instead, the results we present in this paper have been obtained solving the time-
dependent Schr¨odinger equation ab initio for realistic pulse shapes. We ﬁnd a rich structure which
is not always dominated by the laser harmonics.

I. INTRODUCTION

−

The generation of harmonics (HG) through the interaction of atoms with intense laser ﬁelds is a topic that has been
broadly studied from both a theoretical and an experimental point of view. The big interest in the HG is due to
the possible use as a source of short-wavelength radiation. In fact, through the harmonic emission it is possible to
generate coherent XUV radiation using table-top lasers. Recently, harmonics of wavelength as short as 67 ˚A have
been reported [1]. The harmonics spectra obtained from a single atom in a monochromatic laser ﬁeld present some
common and well known features: (i) only linearly polarized odd harmonics are generated [2], (ii) the spectrum has
a plateau structure , (iii) the plateau is extended up to a cut-oﬀ that is located around Ip + 3.17Up, where Ip is the
ionization energy of the atom and Up is the ponderomotive energy [3]. The presence of only odd harmonics is due
to symmetry reasons (a more detailed argument will be discussed in the next section) and the location of the cut-oﬀ
can be explained, at least qualitatively, with the so-called “simple man’s theory” [4]. The interaction of a single atom
with two circularly polarized lasers of frequencies ω and 2 ω has been investigated recently [5]; it has been found that
1 and 3 n + 1 are allowed, the harmonic order 3 n is forbidden by the selection rules
while the harmonic orders 3 n
of the dipole emission, where n is any positive integer. These results agreed with a previous experiment [6].
More recently, the generation of harmonics in more complex systems than the single atom has become a strongly
addressed topic. A model for harmonic emission from atomic clusters has been proposed [7]. The harmonics generated
by electrons moving in the periodic potential of a crystal have been investigated also [8,9].
In this work we want to study the generation of harmonics in ring-shaped molecules, like benzene and other aromatic
compounds. This kind of molecules exhibits an invariance under a rotation of a certain angle around the axis that is
orthogonal to the molecule plane and goes through its center. In this case the potential is periodic in the azimuthal
direction.
The HG from ring-like molecules interacting with a circularly polarized ﬁeld presents many diﬀerent features with
respect to the single-atom case in a linearly polarized ﬁeld: (i) within the same harmonic range fewer lines are emitted
and the higher is the number of atoms in the molecule, the lower is the number of emitted lines, (ii) odd and even
harmonics are equally possible, (iii) the harmonics are alternately left or right circularly polarized. In our opinion,
all these peculiar properties make this topic challenging and worth to be studied in detail.
The paper is organized as following: in Section II we summarize the derivation of the selection rules for the ring-shaped
molecules obtained by Alon et al. [11]. In Section III the numerical model used in our simulations is presented and
discussed. In Section IV we describe the interaction between the ring molecule and the laser ﬁeld. In Section V we
show the results obtained for diﬀerent intensities and frequencies together with a broad discussion. Finally, in Section
VI we give a summary and an outlook. Atomic units (a.u.) are used throughout the paper.

In the case of an atom or a molecule which are shone by a laser ﬁeld of frequency ω, the Hamiltonian is periodic in
time with a period τ = 2π/ω: H(t + τ ) = H(t). The time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (TDSE) for such a system

forms a composite Hilbert space, we can apply the extended Hilbert space formalism. The probability to get the nth

III. NUMERICAL MODEL

In order to keep the numerical eﬀort manageable we restrict ourselves to a two-dimensional (2D) model where the
molecule plane and the rotating electric ﬁeld are properly represented. We study a single active electron in a ring-
shaped potential of N ions. Diﬀerent kinds of “smoothed” potentials can be used for this purpose [13]. The potential
used in our simulations reads

→ ∞

where r0 is the radius of the molecule, and ρ and ϕ are the polar coordinates. β is the parameter which gives the
“degree of smoothness” of the potential and determines the width of the ground state along the ring. α moves the
local maxima of the potential keeping the minima constant (the parameter α is introduced in order to avoid the
presence of points where V = 0 for ﬁnite ρ, because that could generate non-physical ionization). Finally, A is the
“strength” of the potential. For our simulations we chose α = 1.075 and β = 0.3. Once the values of α and β, which
lead to reasonable model properties, have been found and ﬁxed, we varied A for choosing the ionization energy of the
molecule. The potential has N oscillations in the azimuthal direction, each minimum represents the location of one
of the N ions. The potential goes to zero for ρ
It has been tested that the generation of harmonics is very weakly dependent on the ﬁne details of the atomic potential.
Instead, it is strongly dependent on its geometry and symmetries. It is therefore worth to look for a model potential
that, keeping the proper symmetry, can be quite easily numerically optimized, i.e., requiring as few as possible grid
points. In order to achieve this minimization of the number of grid points and to not break any physical symmetry
we used a polar grid. Moreover, we paid attention to use always a number of points in the azimuthal direction that
is an integer multiple of N . We will take N = 6, like benzene, and therefore the potential will exhibit a C6 symmetry
around the orthogonal axis.
For a good understanding of the harmonic spectra it is essential to study the level scheme in detail. Therefore, in order
to characterize our model we have calculated the energy of the ﬁrst six states for diﬀerent potential strengths A in
the interval between 0.2 and 1.6. In this interval the energy of the ground state of the molecule decreases from
0.13
down to
2.66. The ﬁrst, the fourth and the ﬁfth states are non degenerate, the others have a double degeneracy. In
Fig. 1 the energetic behavior of those states versus A is shown. Contour plots of the six states for an intermediate
value of A (A = 0.80) are shown in Fig. 2. The pattern shape and the symmetries do not change with A, but the
“average radius”, i.e., the spatial extension, does. Clearly, for low values of A the probability density is more loosely
bound than for high A. In particular this is true for the upper states. For the sake of easy reference later on, we name
the six states as 0, 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4, 5a and 5b. The subscripts are used just to distinguish among the degenerate
states. The non-degenerate states 0, 4 and 5 have the full C6 symmetry.
As one can infer from Fig. 1 the six states can be divided in two branches: the ﬁrst one, containing the ﬁrst four states,
0
5, that decreases
much more slowly and lies even in the continuum for A < 0.4. As a result, for an increasing A an increasing gap
between the two branches appears. To obtain the ionization potential of real benzene (
0.34 a.u.) we have to choose
A = 0.37. Surprisingly, at that position the level scheme of our simple model resembles the molecular orbital (MO)
scheme of the real benzene very well [14]. In particular, the states 4 and 5 are still in the continuum so that only
the four states 0
3, possessing the same degeneracies as the MO, are bound. A magniﬁcation of the region around
A = 0.37 is also shown in Fig. 1. Another parameter that will play a role in the HG is the level spacing Ω between
the ground state and the ﬁrst excited state. For an increasing A, i.e., a decreasing ground state energy, Ω decreases.

3, decreases very fast as A increases, and a second one, containing the two upper states, 4

IV. MOLECULE-FIELD INTERACTION

In dipole approximation the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for a single electron in a laser ﬁeld ~E(t) and under
the inﬂuence of an eﬀective ionic potential V (~r) is given in length gauge by

In our case the dipole approximation is excellent because the molecule has a size much smaller than the wavelength
of the laser ﬁeld. We used a circularly polarized laser ﬁeld that in cartesian coordinates is described by

This TDSE can be solved ab initio on a PC. We did this by propagating the wavefunction in time with a Crank-
Nicholson approximant to the propagator U (t, t + ∆t) = exp[
i∆ tH(t + ∆t/2)] where H(t) is the explicitly time-
dependent Hamiltonian corresponding to the TDSE (12). Our algorithm is fourth order in the grid spacing ∆ρ, ∆ϕ
and second order in the time step ∆t. The boundary condition is Ψ(0, t) = Ψ(2π, t) for all ρ and t. Probability density
which approaches the grid boundary is removed by an imaginary potential.

Here we discuss the results obtained from our 2D simulations and we compare them with previous results from
a one dimensional model (1D) presented elsewhere [15]. Our studies were mainly focused on the structure of the
harmonic spectrum for diﬀerent values of the ionization energy. In general, our ﬁndings show that, together with
the harmonics we expected from the selection rules other lines are present and their location can be, in most of the
cases, explained with the help of the level scheme. In particular, we observed that for higher A the gap between the
two branches of Fig. 1 plays an important role. For each A various simulations with pulses of the same frequency
and length but diﬀerent intensities were performed. We used sine-square pulses of 30 cycles duration and a frequency
ω = 0.0942, unless noted otherwise. In order to better understand the additional lines which appear besides the
expected harmonics it is useful to study the low intensity regime ﬁrst.

V. RESULTS

A. Low Fields

→

In the case of a single atom, when the intensity of the ﬁeld is not high enough for generating harmonics eﬃciently, the
Fourier transform of the dipole shows only the fundamental. Clearly, the threshold of the ﬁeld strength to observe any
harmonics depends on the ionization potential. In Fig. 3 two spectra, for diﬀerent A, obtained from the interaction
of the ring molecule with a low ﬁeld pulse are shown. For the dipole emission spectrum of Fig. 3a an electric ﬁeld
amplitude E = 0.02 a.u. was used and A = 1.6. In this case apart from the fundamental two additional lines are
present although there are not harmonics. The positions of the two lines are at 16.3 ω and 18.5 ω, respectively. We
5 and
refer to them as Λa and Λb here after. These two lines correspond to two resonances between the states 0
3
4 and therefore they move towards the red if A decreases. This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 3b, where A = 1.4 and
E = 0.01. In Fig. 3b also the 5th harmonic is present, this is due to the fact that when the ionization potential is
lower the generation of harmonics requires weaker ﬁelds. A subfundamental line at ω
Ω, corresponding to a virtual
transition from ω to the ﬁrst excited state 1, is also present in both cases. We name this line Υ. Looking closer,
one observes that, with respect to the positions one would expect from the unperturbed level scheme, Λa and Λb are
blue-shifted, whereas Υ is slightly red-shifted. This opposite shift can be explained by the dynamical Stark eﬀect.
The ground state remains almost uneﬀected and the lower-lying states move slightly. The higher-lying states instead,
experience a relatively strong shift. Therefore, with increasing laser intensity the gap between the two branches in
Fig. 1 increases, leading to a blue shift of Λa and Λb. The level spacing ω
Ω decreases, giving rise to a red-shifted
Υ. The three lines Λa, Λb and Υ are the ﬁrst lines to appear in the low ﬁeld regime. The subfundamental line can be
considered as characteristic for the low ﬁeld regime. Indeed, with increasing ﬁeld strength, it moves towards the red
and ﬁnally becomes very diﬃcult to be resolved.

B. High Fields

With increasing laser intensity the actual harmonic spectrum develops. In Fig. 4 we show HG spectra for four diﬀerent
electric ﬁeld amplitudes and A = 1.6. In Fig. 4a E = 0.03 a.u. and the situation is, at ﬁrst sight, quite similar to
that one of Fig. 3a: Λa and Λb are present, but also the ﬁrst allowed harmonic is there, i.e. the 5th. Increasing the
ﬁeld to E = 0.15 a.u., Fig. 4b, also the 7th, the 11th and the 13th appear, and the two lines Λa and Λb cannot be
distinguished anymore but they merge into a single structure not resolved in our plot. This last phenomenon can be
explained taking into account at least three diﬀerent eﬀects: (i) in general, the width of Λa and Λb increases for higher
ﬁelds, (ii) other channels, i.e. other resonance lines between the two branches, can be opened if the ﬁeld becomes
intense, and (iii) through a removal of the degeneracy of the states by the electric ﬁeld more possible resonance lines
are obtained. These factors generate a kind of broad “hill” in the harmonic spectrum, the position of which is function
a of A. Moreover, in Fig. 4b other satellite lines around the expected harmonics are present. Those lines are decays
from virtual states to real states, like the subfundamental Υ. In Fig. 4c, E = 0.24 a.u., more couples of harmonics
are present and the hill is reduced to a background modulation of the main HG spectrum. This becomes even clearer

4

≈

in Fig. 4d where harmonics up to the 47th are observed and the 17th and 19th are located just on the hill. We have
also studied in more detail how the strength of the harmonics increases (or decreases) in function of the electric ﬁeld.
The results for harmonics up to the 31st are shown in Fig. 5. For each couple of harmonics there is a minimum ﬁeld
threshold, below which the harmonic lines cannot be picked out from the background. All the harmonic strengths
of Fig. 5 are normalized to the fundamental. What is worth to stress is that for the 5th harmonic we can have an
eﬃciency up to 14%.
Repeating the sequence of simulations shown in Fig. 4 for a lower A gives results that are quite similar to those shown
in Fig. 4 as long as the gap between the two branches is quite large. When the gap becomes of the order of about
ten photons the two lines Λa and Λb play a role that is less important. This is due to the fact that, as the gap is
smaller, the two lines are expected to be located in a low frequency region and therefore they are easily hidden by the
background of the main HG spectrum that in the low frequency region is higher. Furthermore, as the intensity of the
harmonic lines is strongly enhanced with increasing ﬁeld, the strength of Λa and Λb is not. Also the extension of the
harmonic spectrum is dependent on A, for lower A less harmonics can be generated (for a ﬁxed frequency).
As already mentioned, Ω is the distance between 0 and 1. For high A (or high ω) we have ω > Ω but for decreasing
A (or decreasing ω), Ω approaches the laser frequency and overtakes it. The ratio of ω and Ω strongly aﬀects the
Ω a very complex spectrum is
harmonic emission by the ring molecule. In particular, we observed that when ω
generated and together with the expected harmonics many other lines of similar intensities are present. This eﬀect
can be seen in Fig. 6. A very similar behavior was also observed in the 1D model [15]. In particular, the shape of the
additional satellite structures around each allowed harmonic are in the two cases alike. It seems that in this resonant
case the system is not in a single non-degenerate Floquet state as assumed for the proof of the selection rules [11].
In that derivation the pulse was assumed as inﬁnite. Therefore, the particular behavior of the dipole emission could
be also due to a pulse shape eﬀect. However, pulse shape eﬀects should be not dependent on the frequency, and in
fact, we have additional lines for all the frequencies, but those lines play always a minor role respect to the expected
harmonics. Instead, when the laser frequency becomes nearly resonant many new strong lines appear.
Keeping the same pulse parameters and decreasing the parameter A the ionization increases. When we want to study
a model that is closer to the real benzene, we have to take A = 0.37. With this condition the physical scheme is very
diﬀerent from those of the cases previously discussed; the ionization energy is reduced from 2.68 to 0.34 and, as we
already mentioned, only four states are present and the “gap” does not exist at all. Under these conditions a pulse
with the frequency ω = 0.0942, which we used so far, leads to emission spectra without any harmonic structure. This is
mainly for the reason that the frequency is relatively high with respect to the ionization potential and therefore just a
very few photons are suﬃcient for reaching the continuum. Therefore, unless the ﬁeld is very low the ionization would
prevail at soon. Also making a comparison with the rule for the cut-oﬀ position used in the atomic case (Ip + 3.17Up)
we should not expect any harmonics due to the low value of Up. Therefore, we made a series of simulations with the
benzene model but using a lower frequency, ω = 0.0314. With this frequency eleven photons are required for reaching
the continuum, i.e., the molecule can be ionized only with a high-order multiphoton process. A spectrum obtained
with this low frequency and E = 0.035 is shown in Fig. 7. Like in the highly-bound high frequency case the emission
spectrum exhibits the harmonics allowed by the selection rules. The eﬃciency of the harmonics in Fig. 7 is not as high
as that one of the harmonics of Fig. 4 but we belief that this is mainly just a problem of optimization. Another line,
located around 3 ω is also present in the spectrum of Fig. 7. This line is a resonance between the states 0 and 1 (for
A = 0.37, Ω = 0.0914
3 ω ). It is interesting to note that in this case of a weakly bound electron the results from
the 2D simulations are diﬀerent with respect to those from the 1D simulations [15]. In the latter case no harmonic
structure was observed for ω < Ω. This, in our opinion, could be due to the reason that in the 1D model the level
scheme is qualitatively diﬀerent. In particular, there is no continuum in the 1D case.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have studied the harmonic emission in a ring molecule. We have shown that when a ring molecule
interacts with a laser pulse, together with the series of harmonics predicted by the selection rules, other lines are
present. Under certain conditions the strength of these lines can be comparable with that one of the harmonics. Our
HG spectra present a structure and a complexity that is absent in the numerical results shown in [11]. This is due to
the reason that while there a 1D Floquet simulation was performed in our studies a realistic pulse (i.e., a ﬁnite pulse
with a certain envelope) and a 2D model with ionization included were used, and the TDSE was solved ab initio.
What is worth to note is the scaling of the TDSE (12) with respect to the size of the molecule. If one scales the
molecule radius like ρ′ = αρ, the TDSE (12) remains invariant if t′ = α2t, V ′ = V /α2, E′ = E/α3, ω′ = ω/α2 are
chosen. Therefore our results for high A can reproduce the results that would have been obtained for a bigger molecule
with a lower ionization potential interacting with a ﬁeld of lower frequency. Moreover, because of the generality of

5

the hypotheses taken into account, one can think about the diﬀerent cases of Fig. 1 as the level scheme of positively
charged molecules as well.
To our knowledge, so far harmonics in ring-shaped molecules have been investigated experimentally only in gaseous
samples [16]. Studying a gaseous sample is very diﬀerent with respect to what we did in our simulations. Because
the molecules in a gas have a random orientation it is not possible to apply the symmetry properties discussed. If
the propagation direction of the circularly polarized ﬁeld is not orthogonal to the plane of the molecule, the molecule
“sees” a ﬁeld that is elliptically polarized. This breaks the discrete rotational symmetry and other harmonics become
possible. Nonetheless, even if it is not possible to make a direct comparison it is useful to note that the results
presented in [16] conﬁrm that ring molecules, like benzene and cyclohexane, can tolerate short pulses of high intensity
and phenomena like fragmentation and Coulomb explosion do not play a big role. In order to reproduce in a real
experiment the results we presented, it is fundamental to prepare a sample where most of the molecules lie in the
same plane. This could be done with some orientation techniques or, considering the particular shape of the organic
molecules, preparing a very thin layer.
We described and discussed results for a molecules with N = 6, but cases with higher N are as well possible. Moreover,
the higher is N the higher is the frequency of the ﬁrst generated harmonic; in the limit of very high N , harmonics of
very short wavelength could be generated.
In this work we a took into account a single active electron, but also including correlation through both, a full
description [11] or an appropriate treatment like time-dependent density functional theory, would not not change the
symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian describing the system. Therefore, the selection rules would apply as well.
More complex molecules which produces similar selection rules [17] are the nanotubes [19]. They can be very long
in the longitudinal direction and exhibit a discretized cylindrical symmetry. A semiclassical approach to harmonic
generation from nanotubes was also investigated [18]. Unfortunately, because of their size, the dipole approximation
would not be accurate enough. Therefore, an ab initio numerical simulation in 3D would be at the limit, or probably
beyond, the calculation capabilities of even the fastest computers now available.

be observed comparing (b) with (a).

Fig. 4. Evolution of the harmonic spectrum with increasing ﬁeld for A = 1.6. In (a) E = 0.03, in (b) E = 0.15, in (c)
E = 0.24 and in (d) E = 0.30. When the ﬁeld increases additional satellite lines appear with the low order harmonics.
The highest allowed resolved harmonic is the 47th.

Fig. 5. Strength of each harmonic line versus the electric ﬁeld E. It is worth to note that the ﬁrst allowed harmonic,
i.e., the 5th, can reach an eﬃciency up to 14%. In the low ﬁeld region the strength of the the 17th and 19th harmonic
is particularly high, this is due to the presence of the “hill”. The value of A is constant, A = 1.6.

Fig. 6. Emission spectrum for A = 1.00 and ω = 0.0942. The value of Ω approaches the laser frequency ω and the
spectrum exhibits a complex structure with many additional strong lines.

Fig. 7. Emission spectrum for A = 0.37 and ω = 0.0314. Also in this case, where the ionization potential corresponds
to that one of the benzene molecule, the spectrum exhibits the same structure as in the highly-bound high frequency
case. The line around 3 ω is given by a decay from the state 1 to the state 0.

Abstract

We present an ab initio calculation of the screened self-energy correction for (1s)22p3/2 and
(1s)22s states of Li-like ions with nuclear charge numbers in the range Z = 12-100. The evaluation

is carried out to all orders in the nuclear-strength parameter Zα. This investigation concludes our

calculations of all two-electron QED corrections for the 2p3/2-2s transition energy in Li-like ions

and thus considerably improves theoretical predictions for this transition for high-Z ions.

Introduction

Recent progress in high-precision spectroscopy of highly charged ions has attracted sig-

niﬁcant attention to these systems. Accurate experimental determination of energy levels

is nowadays possible for very heavy ions of the periodical table up to H-like uranium. Such

systems provide a unique testing ground for quantum electrodynamics (QED) in a strong

ﬁeld of the nucleus. While the simplicity of the hydrogen isoelectronic sequence makes it

ideal for theoretical investigations, the achieved experimental accuracy is by far better in

few-electron systems. In particular, the Lamb shift in H-like uranium is presently known at

the 3% level [1], whereas the 2p3/2-2s splitting in Li-like bismuth was measured to be

E2p3/2 − E2s = 2788.139(9) eV ,

(1)

where the QED correction, which is about 26 eV, can be (in principle) tested at the 0.15%

level. Very high experimental accuracy is also achieved for 2p3/2-2s and 2p1/2-2s transitions

in other heavy Li-like ions [2, 3, 4, 5].

In order to match the experimental accuracy for Li-like ions in theoretical investigations,

rigorous calculations of all QED eﬀects to second order in the ﬁne structure constant α are

needed. Characteristic property of heavy ions is that the nuclear-strength parameter Zα

can not be used as an expansion parameter in theoretical considerations, which corresponds

to the non-perturbative (in Zα) regime of the bound-state QED. On the other hand, the

electron-electron interaction in heavy ions can be accounted for by a rapidly-converging

perturbation expansion in the parameter 1/Z. In our approach, we start in zeroth approx-

imation with non-interacting electrons propagating in the external ﬁeld of the nucleus (the

Furry picture). Corrections to this approximation arise from exchanges by one, two, and

more virtual photons. For corrections involving one and two virtual photons, we employ

a rigorous QED treatment complete to all orders in the parameter Zα. Higher-order cor-

rections can not be addressed within bound-state QED at present. This part should be,

therefore, evaluated within the standard approach based on the no-pair Dirac-Breit Hamil-

tonian.

Such project was carried out for the 2p1/2-2s transition of Li-like ions in a series of our

investigations [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Comparison of the total theoretical value obtained for the

Li-like uranium [7, 8] with the corresponding experimental results [2, 4] probes QED eﬀects

of second order in α on the level of about 17%. This is the strictest test of predictions of

2

bound-state QED in the background of a strong external ﬁeld at the moment. Our present

goal is to perform a similar project for the 2p3/2-2s transition energy in Li-like ions. For one

speciﬁc ion, Li-like bismuth, analogous calculation was carried out previously by Sapirstein

and Cheng [11].

The leading (∼ 1/Z 0) QED eﬀect in Li-like ions is the one-loop self-energy and vacuum-

polarization corrections. Their calculation can be considered as well established at present

(see, e.g., review [12] and references therein). Other important QED eﬀects are those of

order 1/Z, the screened self-energy and vacuum-polarization corrections and the two-photon

exchange correction. The screened vacuum-polarization correction for n = 1 and n = 2 states

of Li-like ions was evaluated previously in Ref. [6]. The two-photon exchange correction was

obtained in Refs. [7, 8] for the 2s and 2p1/2 states and in Refs. [13, 14] for the 2p3/2 state. An

independent evaluation of the two-photon exchange correction for Li-like ions was performed

by Andreev et al. [15, 16]. A calculation of the screened self-energy correction was carried

out in Ref. [9] for the 2s and 2p1/2 states. The goal of the present investigation is to perform

an evaluation of the screened self-energy correction for the 2p3/2 state of Li-like ions, which

concludes the calculation of all QED corrections of order 1/Z for the 2p3/2-2s transition.

The remaining QED eﬀect that involves two virtual photons is the one-electron two-loop

QED correction. Its calculation to all order to Zα is presently performed for the 1s state

only [17, 18]. In this work, we present an estimation for this correction based on known

terms of the Zα expansion and on the full result for the 1s state.

The paper is organized as follows. In Sec. I we describe general formulas for the screened

self-energy correction for a Li-like ion. A brief discussion of the renormalization of the

formal expressions is given. In Sec. II we present the results of our numerical evaluation.

Various theoretical contributions to the 2p3/2-2s transition energy are collected in Sec. III.

Theoretical predictions obtained for the total transition energy are compared with results
by other authors and experimental data. The relativistic units (~ = c = m = 1) are used

throughout the paper.

I. BASIC FORMULAS

The screened self-energy correction is graphically represented by Feynman diagrams

shown in Fig. 1. The detailed derivation of formal expressions for this correction can be

3

found in Ref. [9], where it was obtained by the two-time Green function method developed

by Shabaev (see Ref. [19] for the description of the method). Here, we present only the

ﬁnal expressions for the screened self-energy correction due to the interaction of the valence

electron with the (1s)2 shell.

The contribution of diagrams in Fig. 1(a) is conveniently divided into the reducible and

irreducible parts. The reducible part is a contribution in which the energy of the total

intermediate state of the system coincides with the initial (ﬁnal) energy of the system, and

the irreducible part is the remainder. The irreducible part can be expressed in terms of

non-diagonal matrix elements of the one-loop self-energy operator Σ,

∆Eir = 2

where c and v label the core and the valence electron, respectively; µc is the momentum

projection of the core electron, the factor of 2 accounts for two equivalent diagrams, the

self-energy operator is deﬁned by

G is the Dirac-Coulomb Green function G(ε) = [ε − H(1 − i0)]−1, H is the Dirac-Coulomb
Hamiltonian, Dµν is the photon propagator, αµ = (1, α) are the Dirac matrices, and x12 =

x1−x2. The modiﬁed wave functions |δci and |δvi in Eq. (2) are the ﬁrst-order perturbations

of the initial wave functions |ci and |vi due to the electron-electron interaction:

where u = 1 − i0 ensures the correct position of poles of the electron propagators with

The total self-energy correction to the interaction of the valence electron with the (1s)2

shell is given by the sum of the irreducible, reducible, and vertex parts:

∆Escr. se. = ∆Eir + ∆Ered + ∆Ever .

(9)

The formulas presented so far are only the formal expressions and suﬀer from ultraviolet

(UV) and infrared (IR) divergences that should be explicitly eliminated before the numerical

calculation can be started. We note that the irreducible part given by Eq. (2) is expressed in

terms of non-diagonal matrix elements of the one-loop self-energy operator and, therefore,

can be calculated by a straightforward generalization of a scheme developed for the ﬁrst-

order self-energy correction. The method used for this in the present investigation is based on

an expansion of the bound-electron propagator in terms of the interaction with the nuclear

Coulomb ﬁeld [20]; a detailed description of the numerical procedure is given in Ref. [21].

The second term in the reducible part (7) consists of the ﬁrst-order self-energy corrections

multiplied by a simple expression; the corresponding numerical evaluation is also reduced

to a ﬁrst-order calculation.

The calculation of the remaining part of Eq. (7) and the vertex part (8) is more dif-

ﬁcult. These two contributions should be considered together since they contain UV and

IR divergences that cancel each other in the sum.

In order to separate UV divergences

in a covariant way, we separate from the reducible and vertex parts the contribution of

free-electron propagators. This contribution is treated in momentum space within the di-

mensional regularization and the divergences are separated by using the standard technique

of free-particle QED. The remainder does not contain any UV divergences and is treated in

coordinate space. IR divergences still present in the remainder are separated, regularized

5

by introducing a ﬁnite photon mass, and canceled analytically. The general procedure for

handling divergent terms and the proof of their cancellation is described in our previous

investigation [21].

II. NUMERICAL CALCULATION AND RESULTS

The calculation of the screened self-energy correction for the (1s)22p3/2 state resembles

that for other n = 2 states described in our previous work [9]. A higher value of the total

momentum of the valence electron (jv = 3/2) in the present case makes ﬁnal expressions

more lengthy and their numerical evaluation more time consuming. Signiﬁcant compli-

cations appear when performing angular integrations in momentum space for the vertex

part with free electron propagators. For this purpose, we developed a generalization of the

angular-integration procedure described in Ref. [9] to arbitrary states, using our experience

in calculating similar angular integrals for the one-electron two-loop self-energy diagrams

[18].

as

The actual calculation was carried out in the Feynman gauge and taking into account the

ﬁnite size of the nucleus. The homogeneously-charged spherical-shell model was employed for

the nuclear-charge distribution. Our numerical results for the screened self-energy correction
due to the interaction of the valence electron with the (1s)2 shell for the 2s and 2p3/2 states

of Li-like ions are presented in Table I in terms of the dimensionless function F (αZ) deﬁned

∆E = m α2(αZ)3F (αZ) .

(10)

The results listed for the 2s state are very close to those obtained in our previous inves-

tigation [9]. In the present work, we slightly improve the numerical accuracy and extend

our calculation to Z = 12, 14, and 16.

In the table, we compare our results with those

by Sapirstein and Cheng [11] obtained for one speciﬁc case Z = 83. We observe a certain

deviation of their numerical values from our results. A similar disagreement is present also

for the 2p1/2 state [9]. This discrepancy is not resolved at present. We note, however, that

our results for n = 2 states of He-like ions [22] (which are strongly related to the correction

considered here) agree well with the known terms of the Zα expansion and that our results

for the ground state of He-like ions [23] are in excellent agreement with an independent

calculation by Sunnergren [24].

III. 2P3/2-2S TRANSITION ENERGY IN LI-LIKE IONS

In this section we collect all presently available theoretical contributions to the 2p3/2-2s

transition energy in Li-like bismuth, thorium, and uranium. Individual corrections for these

ions are presented in Table II. The Dirac values including the ﬁnite-nuclear-size eﬀect were

obtained by solving the Dirac equation and employing the two-parameter Fermi model for

the nuclear-charge distribution. Parameters of the Fermi model were expressed in terms

of the root-mean-square (rms) radii, which numerical values are listed in the table. The

uncertainty of the nuclear-size eﬀect was evaluated by averaging two errors obtained by

7

varying the rms radius within the error bars given in the table and by varying the model of

the nuclear-charge distribution (the Fermi and the homogeneously-charged-sphere models

were employed). The one-photon exchange correction was evaluated utilizing the Fermi

model for the nuclear-charge distribution. The one-loop self-energy correction was taken

from a tabulation in Ref. [25] for the 2s state and from Ref. [26] for 2p3/2 state. The Uehling

part of the one-loop vacuum-polarization correction was calculated in this work for the Fermi

nuclear model. The Wichmann-Kroll part of this correction was taken from a tabulation in

Ref. [27]. The two-photon exchange correction was evaluated within framework of QED in

our previous investigation [13]. Numerical values for the screened self-energy correction are

taken from Table I. The screened vacuum-polarization correction was calculated in Ref. [6].

Rigorous calculation of the two-loop QED correction is a challenging problem, which is

presently accomplished for the 1s state and for Z ≥ 40 only [17, 18]. For excited states, one

has to rely on the Zα expansion, which reads

(11)

(cid:3)(cid:9)

where L = ln[(Zα)−2], Gh.o.(Zα) = B60 + (Zα)(· · · ) is the higher-order remainder. For ns

states, results for all coeﬃcients up to B60 are available, whereas for np states calculations

were performed for the coeﬃcients up to B62 only. (Details can be found in a review [28],

references therein, and more recent studies [29, 30].) Great care should be taken employing

the Zα expansion for the evaluation of the total two-loop correction for middle- and high-Z

ions, due to a very slow convergence of this expansion. In order to estimate the two-loop

QED correction for the 2s state, we separate the 1s higher-order remainder Gh.o.(Zα) from

the numerical data of Ref. [18] and use it as an estimation of the corresponding contribution

for the 2s state, with an uncertainty of 50%. For p states, no analytical calculations for B61

coeﬃcient exist up to now. We thus separate from the 1s numerical results of Ref. [18] the

divide it by a factor of 8, and take the result as an uncertainty for the higher-order contri-

function

bution for p states.

The relativistic recoil correction was evaluated to all orders in Zα in Refs. [31, 32]. The

three-photon exchange correction was calculated for Z = 83 in Ref. [11] by utilizing many-

8

body perturbation theory. For two other cases, Z = 90 and 92, we use the result for Z = 83

with a 100% uncertainty. For Z = 83, a 50% uncertainty is assumed, which corresponds

to neglected QED eﬀects. Finally, the nuclear-polarization correction was calculated in

Refs. [33, 34].

The total theoretical values for the transition energy in Table II are compared with the

experimental data [35, 36, 37] and with the previous theoretical evaluations [11, 38, 39, 40,

41]. We note that in all previous calculation except the one of Ref. [11], two-electron QED

eﬀects (eﬀects of the “screening” of QED corrections) were accounted for only approximately

or partly. A treatment which is closest to the approach presented in this work is that

by Sapirstein and Cheng [11], where all two-electron QED corrections were evaluated for

Z = 83. Diﬀerence between our total result and that of Ref. [11] is mainly due to the

estimate of the two-loop QED correction that is included in the present compilation but was

not accounted for in Ref. [11].

Summarizing, we have presented an evaluation of the screened self-energy correction to

the 2p3/2-2s transition energy of Li-like ions with Z ≥ 12. This concludes our calculation

of all two-electron QED corrections for this transition and considerably improves the corre-

sponding theoretical predictions. It is demonstrated that the largest theoretical uncertainty

for high-Z ions stems now from the two-loop QED correction, which calculation to all orders

in Zα is needed in order to approach the experimental accuracy.

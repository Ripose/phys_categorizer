Abstract

e-mail: sorg@theo2.physik.uni-stuttgart.de

The practical usefulness of Relativistic Schr¨odinger Theory (RST) is tested by calculating approx-

imately the energy diﬀerence between the excited singlet state 1s2s 1S0 and the ground state 1s2 1S0

of the helium-like ions with arbitrary charge number zex (2

100). The results are compared

zex ≤

to the corresponding predictions of other theoretical approaches in the literature and to the experi-

mental data. Since the exact solutions of the RST energy eigenvalue problem are unknown, one has

to resort to approximative methods. However the crudest approximation (“spherically symmetric

approximation”) yields relatively accurate results so that it seems worth while to develop more

powerful approximation techniques

INTRODUCTION

The well - known wave - particle duality [1] in quantum theory [2] enables one to interprete

some of the quantum phenomena in terms of the particle picture ( with the associated statis-

tical interpretation ), whereas other phenomena of elementary matter are more conveniently

understood in ﬂuid - dynamic terms due to the wave picture, e.g. the Bose - Einstein conden-

sates [3],[4]. Especially interesting are the ﬁelds of “intersection” where both pictures can be

simultaneously applied, and then must be expected to predict the same numerical results for

the outcome of the corresponding experiments. An example for this type is non - relativistic

atomic physics where it can be shown that the ﬂuid - dynamic approach ( i.e. the density

functional formalism [5, 6] ) is exactly equivalent to conventional quantum mechanics, being

based on the use of wave functions in place of density distributions.

The situation is somewhat diﬀerent in relativistic quantum mechanics where neither a

well - working particle theory nor its ﬂuid - dynamic counterpart for N - particle systems does

exist ( see the many critical comments on the Bethe - Salpeter equations, for instance in ref.s

[7, 8].

The recently established Relativistic Schr¨odinger Theory ( RST ) [9, 10] is intended to ﬁll

just this theoretical gap where both basic concepts ( i.e. wave functions and densities ) be-

come united into one picture. From the mathematical point of view, this new theory is

related rather to the ﬂuid - dynamic than to the probabilistic view upon quantum theory.

The reason for this is that RST takes the Whitney sum of the single - particle bundles as the

many - particle bundle, in contrast to conventional quantum mechanics which is based upon

the tensor product of the single - particle Hilbert spaces. Subsequently, we will present

an example where the ﬂuid - dynamic approach ( i.e. RST ) is able to predict frequencies

of atomic spectral lines with acceptable precision, albeit somewhat more inaccurate than

conventional quantum mechanics does. It is important to place emphasis on the fact that

we have to compare here our approximative RST results to those of other approximative

methods, which have to be applied in the conventional domain because a consistent and

complete conventional theory for relativistic N - particle systems does not exist. More con-

cretely, we will apply RST in order to compute the energy diﬀerence between the excited

singlet state 1s 2s 1S0 and the ground state 1s2 1S0 of the helium - like ions with arbitrary

nuclear charge number zex ( 2

100 ). Furthermore, we will compare our results to

zex ≤

≤

2

the analogous predictions obtained by the 1/Z - expansion method [11] which are close to

the analogous predictions of the all - order technique in relativistic many - body perturbation

theory ( MBPT )[12]. Since the latter two approximation techniques rely on the conventional

tensor product formalism, whereas RST utilises the Whitney sum, the predictive po-

tentiality of both formalisms can be directly opposed. And it is worth noting that RST’s

ﬂuid - dynamic approach delivers predictions relatively close to the observational data; see

tables I, II and ﬁgures 1,2. However, it must be stressed that the present comparison of

numerical predictions for spectroscopic data between RST and the conventional approach is

actually a competition between approximative methods. Therefore, the fact that the present

RST results are somewhat more inaccurate than their conventional counterparts [11, 12] does

not hint on an intrinsic deﬁciency of RST itself but merely points to the necessity of devel-

oping better approximation techniques within the framework of RST. Such an improvement

may be conceived in a two - fold way, namely by

(i) invention of more adequate trial functions for extremalising the RST action integral

(ii) solving the corresponding two - dimensional mass eigenvalue problem in the variables

r, ϑ (in place of resorting to the spherically symmetric approximation).

The results are elaborated through the following arrangement:

For the convenience of the reader unfamiliar with RST, some of this new theory’s funda-

mentals are collected into a brief survey, such as the RST dynamics in section II and the

conservation laws following from the RST dynamics in section III. But of no lesser impor-

tance is the RST kinematics, such as the ﬁbre metric Kαβ for the Lie algebra bundle. Indeed,

this object establishes an important link between the RST currents jαµ and the Maxwell

currents jα

µ emerging in the gauge ﬁeld equations; see sections IV and V. The existence of
an action principle ( section VI ) is useful not only for the logical coherence of the theory

and for the deduction of the conservation laws by means of Noether’s theorem, but also for

establishing approximation methods based upon variational techniques. The point here is

that the RST eigenvalue problem for computing energy levels of bound N - particle systems

is suﬃciently complicate in order to prevent elaboration of analytic solutions. Therefore,

we resort here to the spherically symmetric approximation. This method consists in adopt-

ing spherically symmetric ansatz functions for the wave amplitudes and substituting this

“isotropic” ansatz into the action principle in order to deduce the corresponding SO(3) -

3

symmetric eigenvalue equations in section VII and VIII. There exists an interesting point

with this isotropic ansatz; namely, it is exact(!) for the states ns2 1S0, which share their
symmetry with the ground - state 1s2 1S0. The exact wave amplitudes of the more general
solutions n1s n2s 1S0 with diﬀerent principal quantum numbers ( n1 6
ically symmetric but depend on both spherical polar coordinates r and ϑ. However, the

= n2 ) are not spher-

isotropic ansatz with its exclusive dependence of the wave functions on the radial variable

r is tentatively considered as an acceptable approximation for those non - isotropic states
( n1 6

= n2 ).
The exactly isotropic states ns2 1S0 were already considered in great detail in some of

the preceding papers and are therefore presented here only brieﬂy in section IX, mainly in

order to introduce the RST concept of self - interactions which is based on the ﬁbre metric

Kαβ. The latter object is ﬁxed up to one free parameter u ( the self - interaction param-

eter ) whose determination has to be performed by adjusting the RST predictions to the

corresponding experimental value for one selected physical situation (see the selection of the

bismuth ionisation energy in [10, 13]).

The spherically symmetric ( and therefore approximative ) eigenvalue equations for the

= n2 are presented in section X, followed by the normalisation

states n1s n2s 1S0 with n1 6
prescription for the corresponding solutions in section XI. The occurrence of the self -
interactions is much more manifest in the general case ( n1 6
= n2 ) than it is in the exactly
isotropic subset ns2 1S0 of section IX. The latter subset is easily identiﬁed within the more
general set n1s n2s 1S0 by letting coincide the principal quantum numbers ( n1 = n2 ), mass

eigenvalues ( M1 = M2 ), gauge potentials, etc.
ns2 1S0 are kinematically included in the larger but approximative set n1s n2s 1S0.

In this sense, the exact isotropic states

Finally, for the theory to be able to produce deﬁnite predictions, it needs an energy

functional ( ET , say ) whose value upon the numerical solutions of the exact ( n1 = n2 ) or
approximative ( n1 6
RST energy functional is the subject of section XII; and the corresponding numerical re-

= n2 ) eigenvalue system yields the desired atomic energy levels. This

sults are displayed in section XIII, see tables I, II and ﬁgures 1,2. The corresponding

experimental values are taken from ref. [14].

II. RST DYNAMICS

The RST dynamics subdivides into the matter dynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics, and

gauge ﬁeld dynamics. The matter dynamics consists of the Relativistic Schr¨odinger

Equation ( RSE )for the wave function Ψ

or, resp., the Relativistic von Neumann Equation ( RNE )

(cid:3)
if matter is to be described in terms of an intensity matrix

(cid:2)

rather than in terms of a wave

function Ψ. Clearly, a pure state Ψ can always be conceived as a special type of mixture

namely, as the tensor product of Ψ and its Hermitian conjugate Ψ:

III. CONSERVATION LAWS

The matter densities, such as the total current jµ or the energy - momentum density

(D)Tµν, are quite generally deﬁned by means of the intensity matrix

operator ( e.g. velocity operator Γµ or energy - momentum operator

and a corresponding
I
Tµν ) by the following

trace prescription:

jµ = tr (

and the energy - momentum operator

{z

Tµν =

(cid:9)

If the considered N - particle system is acted upon by an external ﬁeld (ex)Fµν, the energy -
momentum tensor of matter (D)Tµν develops a non - trivial source which equals the Lorentz
force density (L)fν [9, 10]

µ(D)Tµν = (L)fν .

∇

Since this force density is composed of internal and external contributions, it does not

vanish for vanishing external ﬁeld strength (ex)Fµν. However, if one includes also the energy -
momentum density of the gauge ﬁelds (G)Tµν and the external interaction density (es)Tµν in
order to obtain the total energy - momentum density (T)Tµν as

(T)Tµν = (D)Tµν + (G)Tµν + (es)Tµν ,

then this total density has vanishing source whenever no external force ﬁeld (ex)Fµν due to
an external source (ex)jµ is present ( i.e (ex)Fµν = 0, (ex)jµ = 0 ):

In contrast to this energy - momentum conservation, which does hold exclusively for closed

systems only ( (ex)jµ = 0 ), the charge conservation law ( 8 ) is valid in any case, whether the

µ(T)Tµν = ~cFµν

( 3 ) when the following alternative version of the conservation equation ( 5 ) is used [9, 10]

which directly relates the Hamiltonian

Hµ to the mass operator

M

. Indeed, multiplying

both sides of the RSE ( 1 ) by the total velocity operator Γµ from the left and observing

( 17 ) yields just the Dirac equation for the N - particle wave function Ψ

Furthermore, the total current jµ ( 10 ) reads for the pure states Ψ ( 3 )

so that the divergence of jµ vanishes just on account of the Dirac equation ( 18 ) ( and its

Hermitian conjugate ) where the covariant constancy of the velocity operator Γµ has also

been presumed

The choice for such a ﬁeld equation for the “gauge potential”

because the desired equation has to be compatible with the already ﬁxed RST dynamics.

In order to exemplify this important point for a special RST object, consider the gauge

currents jαµ, ( α = 1, . . . , N 2 )

with the gauge velocity operators υαµ being deﬁned in terms of the gauge algebra generators

It can be shown that the RST dynamics implies the following source equations for these

metric Kαβ (compatibility tensor)

Indeed, this covariant constancy of the ﬁbre metric Kαβ is necessary in order to ensure the

source relation ( 25 ) also in contravariant form

which, in turn, acts as the desired integrability condition for the gauge ﬁeld equations. Thus,

the RST matter dynamics with its “conservation law” ( 25 ) becomes compatible with the

gauge ﬁeld dynamics requiring the “conservation law” ( 35 ).

V. GAUGE FIELD EQUATIONS

After all these arrangements, it is now almost self - suggesting to select a ﬁeld equation

for the bundle connection

Aµ. For this purpose, ﬁrst consider its curvature

Fµν

Fµν +

∇µAν − ∇νAµ + [

Aµ,

Aν] ,

and then postulate that this object obeys the ( non - Abelian )Maxwell equations

In components, this gauge ﬁeld equation reads

provided the curvature

Fµν is decomposed into its components F α

Indeed, now one is easily convinced that the Maxwell equations ( 37 ) are compatible with

the preceding RST dynamics, and therefore also with their implication ( 30 ). Namely, it is

just the generally valid bundle identity

that has to be applied to the Maxwell equations ( 37 ) in order to see that the continuity

equation ( 30 ) is actually satisﬁed whenever the Maxwell equations are obeyed.

VI. ACTION PRINCIPLE

The logical consistency of the coupled RST - Maxwell dynamics is supported by the fact

that it can be deduced from an action principle [10]

where the RST action integral is given as usual in terms of a Lagrangian LRST through

δWRST = 0 ,

WRST =

d4x LRST [Ψ,

Aµ] .

Z

The preceding conservation laws may then be deduced from this action principle via the

and a gauge ﬁeld part

Noether theorems. According to the subdivision of the RST ﬁelds into a matter part Ψ
Aµ, the total Lagrangian LRST will be also composed of a matter
contribution LD and a gauge ﬁeld part LG, together with a contribution Lex due to the

external ﬁelds ( e.g. Coulomb potential of a nucleus ):

LRST = LD + LG + Lex .

With this arrangement, the extremalisation of the action integral ( 42 ) with respect to the

wave function Ψ yields the RST - Dirac equation ( 18 ); and similarly, the variation with

respect to the gauge potential

Aµ lets emerge the RST - Maxwell equation ( 37 ).

Clearly, the scientiﬁc value of a new theory has to become evident by its successful appli-

cation to practical problems. For this purpose, we choose here the energy diﬀerence ∆E1−2
of the para - helium states 1s2s 1S0 and 1s2 1S0. The reason for this choice is that, on the

one hand, for this quantity there do exist suﬃcient experimental data [14], and on the other

hand, the corresponding predictions of other theoretical approaches [11, 12] are also avail-

able. Thus, a comprehensive comparison of the predictive power of the various theoretical

frameworks becomes feasible, both with inclusion or neglection of self - interactions.

VII. STATIONARY BOUND STATES

It should be a matter of course that the desired energy diﬀerence ∆E1−2 emerges also

in RST by solving as usual the associated energy eigenvalue problem. The corresponding

RST eigenvalue equations are to be deduced from the general RST dynamics by means of a

stationary ansatz for the two - particle wave function Ψ

The ansatz for both Dirac spinors ψa, ( a = 1, 2 ) is as usual

For the exact non - isotropic states n1s n2s 1S0 , the ansatz ( 72 ) is retained, but now

the assumption of spherical symmetry ( i.e. putting B(r, ϑ)

B(r) )spoils the exactness of

the solution. Moreover, it is a general peculiarity of all singlet states 1S0 that the electric

exchange potential B0(r) is zero, which is a consequence of the vanishing of the exchange

density h0 as the time - component of the exchange current hµ

This peculiarity of the para - helium states 1S0 implies that there is no exchange energy of

the “electric” type which leaves the occurrence of the exchange energy to its “magnetic”
counterpart being based upon the space parts ~B, ~h of Bµ and hµ. Since these space parts
~B, ~h are usually much smaller than the time components B0, h0, it may appear that RST

( and the Hartree - Fock approach as its non - relativistic limit ) produces too inaccurate pre-

dictions of the para - helium level system; see the discussion of this point in ref. [16]. The

reason for this common deﬁciency of both the Hartree - Fock approach and RST is the fol-

lowing: this refers to the approximative assumption that the two - particle wave function

could be approximated by only two (albeit appropriately chosen) one - particle wave func-

tions (see the preceding RST ansatz being speciﬁed by equations ( 47 ) - ( 57 )). Within the

HF approach, the deﬁciency is superseded by resorting to the multiconﬁguration Dirac -

Fock method (MCDF) whose counterpart for curing the analogous RST deﬁciency will be

presented in a separate paper.

IX. MASS EIGENVALUE EQUATIONS FOR n1 = n2

With the stationary form of all the RST ﬁelds being ﬁxed, the next step is to substitute

these expressions into the general two - particle Dirac equation ( 18 ). But only for the ns2 1S0
states, where both electrons share the same principle quantum number ( n1 = n2 ⇒
present “isotropic” ( i.e. spherically symmetric ) ansatz can be an exact solution. For this

which are of course to be deduced from the Maxwell equations ( 37 ):

A striking feature of the current mass eigenvalue system ( 84 ) - ( 87 ) is the occurrence of

the self - interaction parameter u in the last equation ( 87 ). Obviously, this is the only place

where the self - interaction eﬀect enters the eigenvalue system. It can be shown that this

peculiarity is due to the fact that for the ns2 1S0 states both electrostatic charge densities

coincide; see equation ( 81 ). More generally spoken, the self - interactions emerge in RST in

connection with the covariantly constant ﬁbre metric Kαβ ( 32 ) - ( 34 ). This objects converts
RST currents jαµ to Maxwell currents jα
Thus, the ﬁbre metric Kαβ essentially determines the coupling of the ﬁeld strengths F α

µ which, in turn, enter the Maxwell equations ( 38 ).

Evidently, this ﬁbre metric Kαβ owns one degree of freedom which plays the part of a

“renormalisation parameter”, because it continously changes the coupling strengths of gauge

ﬁelds and currents. This is the reason why it emerges in connection with the original
coupling constant αS = e2
~c on the right - hand side of equation ( 87 ). It is not subject to
any constraints, and therefore, it can be used to let the RST predictions coincide with

the observational data. The point here is that this matching of theoretical predictions and

experimental data can be accomplished by ﬁxing one value for u for all the considered charge

numbers zex, see ref [13]. Observe also, that in the Poisson equation ( 86 ) the electrostatic

coupling constant αS is not renormalised by the self - interactions, in contrast to the magnetic
αSe−2u. As a consequence of this peculiarity of the states
case of equation ( 87 ): αS ⇒
ns2 1S0, the magnetic interactions are completely switched oﬀ for u

, leaving the ﬁeld

conﬁguration to be of purely electrostatic type. This ﬁeld conﬁguration is already known

from ref. [18] as the electrostatic approximation.

X. MASS EIGENVALUE EQUATIONS FOR n1

= n2

It is necessary to stress that the eigenvalue system ( 84 ) - ( 87 ) for the ns2 1S0 states is

exact and therefore can be deduced either from the RST variational principle ( 41 ) by means

of the isotropic ansatz for the wave functions ψa and the gauge ﬁelds Aα

µ; or this system

can be alternatively deduced by directly substituting the isotropic ansatz into the original

ﬁeld equations for matter ( 18 ) and gauge ﬁelds ( 37 ). For a detailed study of the ns2 1S0
[9, 13, 16, 17]. Generalising now the situation to the states n1s n2s 1S0

state see refs.

with diﬀerent principal quantum numbers n1 and n2, the isotropic ansatz can no longer be

substituted into the RST ﬁeld equations, because they do not admit those isotropic, well
localised solutions for n1 6
Nevertheless, the isotropic ansatz does not become useless for this more general situation,

= n2 ( albeit solutions, diverging at spatial inﬁnity, may exist ).

but it is merely devaluated to an approximative solution, whose quality may serve to estimate

17

6
the inﬂuence of the neglected anisotropy. The corresponding approximate ﬁeld equations

are obtained by substituting the isotropic ansatz into the action principle ( 41 ) and carrying

out the variational procedure. This yields the following mass eigenvalue equations for the

There is a nice consistency check for the more general situation with diﬀerent quantum

numbers n1 6
= n2: the previous eigenvalue system ( 84 ) - ( 87 ) for the special subset of states
ns2 1S0, being deﬁned through the identiﬁcations ( 78 ) - ( 83 ), must be recoverable from the

present system ( 91 ) - ( 102 ). Indeed, some simple arguments show that this requirement
is satisﬁed. In this sense, the more general system for n1 6
isotropic ( and therefore approximative! ) generalisation of the special subcase with n1 = n2.

= n2 appears to be the unique

In view of this intimate relationship between the general and special cases, one may expect

the general case yielding suﬃciently realistic predictions for the n1s n2s 1S0 energy levels

despite its approximative character; see the numerical results below for veriﬁcation of this

supposition.

XI. NORMALISATION CONDITIONS

The spectrum of desired solutions R±(r), S±(r) of the mass eigenvalue equations ( 91 ) -

( 94 ) is unique only if a normalisation condition upon these solutions is imposed. Such a

19

condition is closely related to the asymptotic form of the electrostatic one - particle potentials

(a)A0(~r) ( a = 1, 2 ). Indeed, one expects that each of the two potentials (a)A0(~r) is of the

Coulomb form in the asymptotic region ( r

)

→ ∞

because each of the two electrons carries one negative charge unit.

In order to see this asymptotic link between charge and potential more clearly, explicitely

write down the ﬁrst two equations of the RST - Maxwell system ( 38 ) ( i.e. for β = 1, 2 ):

form:

Z(S)

where the choice of the hypersurface (S) in space - time is arbitrary just on account of

the source equations ( 116 ). The validity of these important source equations can easily

be checked by straightforward computation: First, write down the ﬁrst two non - Abelian

Thus, combining the last three equations ( 118 ), ( 119 ) and ( 121 ) actually yields the desired

(cid:2)

(cid:3)

source equations ( 116 ) for the eﬀective currents (a)lµ ( 114 ) - ( 115 ).

Clearly, for the stationary bound states considered here, the hypersurface (S) of the

normalisation integral ( 117 ) will be chosen as a time - slice ( t = const ) which converts the

general prescription ( 117 ) to an ordinary integral over three - space

d3~r (a)l0(~r) = 1

Z

(a = 1, 2) .

Furthermore, according to the general relations ( 32 ), the Maxwellian currents ja

ν may be
expressed in terms of the RST currents jaµ ( 62 ) - ( 63 ) such that the eﬀective currents (a)lµ

( 114 ) - ( 115 ) ﬁnally reappear as

Thus, deﬁning the normalisation parameters ˆza ( a = 1, 2 ) as

Here, the exchange charge g∗ is deﬁned in terms of the time - component G0(~r) of the entan-

and the sum of both normalisation parameters ˆza ( 126 ) - ( 127 ) yields just the particle

number ( N = 2 )

Z

ˆz1 + ˆz2 = 2 .

It is true, ﬁxing the value of the normalisation parameters ˆza ( 125 ) by the constraints

( 126 ) - ( 127 ) really represents a normalisation condition upon the wave functions ψa(~r),
namely via the links ( 62 ) - ( 63 ) between charge densities (a)k0(~r) and wave functions ψa(~r).

But these conditions still depend on the gauge ﬁelds which enter the exchange charge g∗
( 128 ). Therefore, introducing the “electric” exchange ﬁeld strength ~X(~r) by

the exchange charge reads in terms of the gauge ﬁelds

But fortunately, the “electric” exchange potential B0(~r) vanishes identically for the present

This result must be inserted into the normalisation conditions ( 126 ) - ( 127 ) and thereby

renders the normalisation procedure an integral part of the eigenvalue problem itself so that

both parts of the problem must be solved simultaneously. ( For the subsequent numerical

calculations, an iterative method will be applied where the normalisation ( 126 ) - ( 127 ) is

repeatedly carried out on each iteration step ). For the exact subset of solutions ( n1 = n2 ) of

section IX, the exchange charge g∗ vanishes because the potential diﬀerence ∆0(~r) ( 133 )

becomes zero; and thus, the normalisation conditions ( 126 ) - ( 127 ) are simpliﬁed to ˆza = 1.

Finally, it remains to be shown that the postulated normalisation conditions ( 122 ) are

consistent with the asymptotic Coulomb form ( 106 ) of the electrostatic potentials (a)A0(~r).

For this purpose, rewrite the electrostatic Poisson equations ( 95 ) - ( 96 ) in terms of the

eﬀective charge densities (a)l0(~r) as

∆(1)A0(~r) = 4παS

(1)l0(~r)

∆(2)A0(~r) = 4παS

(2)l0(~r) .

( For the spherically symmetric approximation the eﬀective charge densities (a)l0(~r) are here

to be replaced by their average values over the solid angle 4π ). Now, integrating these

Poisson equations ( 137 ) - ( 138 ) over all three - space ( 0

the electromagnetic and exchange charges see ref [10] ).

ﬁcient to solve only the mass eigenvalue problem ( 91 ) - ( 105 ), because the mass eigenvalues

d3~r (T)T00(~r) ,

(140)

where, in a relativistic theory, the energy density (T)T00(~r) is the time - time component of
the corresponding energy - momentum density (T)Tµν. This total density is found to consist
essentially of three parts: the matter density (D)Tµν, the gauge ﬁeld density (G)Tµν and the
interaction density (es)Tµν due to the external source (ex)jµ:

(T)Tµν = (D)Tµν + (G)Tµν + (es)Tµν .

Accordingly, the total energy ET ( 140 ) is also built up by three contributions

with the self - evident identiﬁcations

Here, the gauge ﬁeld density (G)Tµν turns out to consist of two subdensities (R)Tµν and (C)Tµν
which are due to the electromagnetic modes F a

µν ( a = 1, 2 )and to the exchange modes

Gµν, resp., cf. equation ( 110 ):

Naturally, the electromagnetic part (R)Tµν appears as the sum of electric and magnetic con-
tributions (e)Tµν and (m)Tµν, i.e.

A similar splitting does apply also to the exchange density (C)Tµν

(C)Tµν = (h)Tµν + (g)Tµν .

(148)

This splitting of the exchange density (C)Tµν is completely analogous to the splitting of its
electromagnetic counterpart ( 147 ); namely, the ﬁrst part (h)Tµν is the energy - momentum
density carried by the “electric” ﬁeld strength ~X(~r); and similarly, the second part (g)Tµν
refers to the “magnetic” exchange ﬁeld strength ~Y (~r). Furthermore, both electromagnetic
contributions (e)Tµν and (m)Tµν are the sums of the mutual - interaction constituents (e)ˆTµν
and (m)ˆTµν and of the self - interaction parts (e)˜Tµν and (m)˜Tµν:

(e)Tµν = (e)ˆTµν + (e)˜Tµν

(m)Tµν = (m)ˆTµν + (m)˜Tµν ,

see ref [13]. Since each of these subdensities generates a contribution to the gauge ﬁeld

energy ET via the recipes ( 143 ) - ( 145 ), the total energy ET ( 142 ) ﬁnally appears as a sum

of eight contributions

The following inspection of all of these energy contributions will yield further insight into

the logical structure of RST.

A. Matter Energy ED

energies Mac2 [13]

First, consider the matter energy ED ( 143 ) which is the corrected sum of both mass -

ED = ED(1) + ED(2) =

M1c2

ˆz1 ·

−

∆ED(1)

+

M2c2

ˆz2 ·

−

∆ED(2)

.

(152)

The necessity of correction terms ∆ED(a), a = 1, 2, is immediately plausible because any mass

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

eigenvalue Ma ( a = 1, 2 )contains the interaction energies of each electron with the other

one and with the external source; and therefore the simple sum of mass - energy equivalents

25

(149)

(150)

(151)

Mac2 would embrace not only the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy as expected,

see ref. [10], but also the interaction energies with the other particle and with the external

source ( i.e. nucleus ). This is the reason why those mutual interaction energies ∆ED(a) have
Mac2 in order to obtain the matter
to be subtracted from the individual mass eigenvalues ˆza ·
energy ED ( 152 ) exclusively as the sum of the kinetic energies of both particles and nothing

else.

Concerning the detailed structure of the subtracted terms ∆ED(a), one ﬁnds them to be

a sum of three contributions refering to the external (es) and internal interactions, where

the latter split up into the electrostatic (e) and exchange (h) types:

M (es)

Clearly, the exchange contribution ( 157 ) of electric type vanishes for the present para - states

1S0 because here both ﬁelds B0(~r) and h0(~r) are zero, see the discussion below eq.( 77 ).

B. External Interaction Energy

A further simpliﬁcation of the total functional ET ( 152 ) occurs in connection with the

external contributions M (es)

a

c2 ( 154 ); and it is worthwhile to elaborate this point in detail

because it elucidates the mechanism of electrostatic RST interactions. First, observe here

that the sum of both external contributions ( 152 ) brings into play the total charge density

j0(~r):

(160)

(161)

(162)

(163)

(164)

(165)

But the point with this total charge density j0(~r) is now that it generates the total electro-

static potential A0(~r), cf. ( 46 )

via the ordinary ( i.e. Abelian ) Poisson equation

A0(~r) + (1)A0(~r) + (2)A0(~r) ,

(cid:18)

(cid:19)

A0(~r) = 4παSj0(~r) .

Indeed, this claim is easily veriﬁed by simply adding up both generalised ( i.e. non -

Abelian ) Poisson equations ( 95 ) and ( 96 ). Obviously, this interesting eﬀect says that

an Abelian structure arises for the total objects emerging from the sum of the non - Abelian

electromagnetic objects! A further demonstration of this eﬀect concerns the electric ﬁeld
strengths ~Ea(~r) +

being originally deﬁned as

Thus, adding up both equations ( 162 ) and ( 163 ) yields again the ordinary ( i.e. Abelian ) re-
lationship between the total ﬁeld strength ~E(~r) and total potential A0(~r):

~E(~r) + ~E1(~r) + ~E2(~r) =

Presuming a similar relationship for the external objects

ﬁelds strengths ~E(~r) ( 164 ) and ~Eex ( 165 )

Internal Electrostatic Interaction

Naturally, there arises the question whether or not a similar cancellation like those for the

external contribution in ( 169 ) can occur also for the internal electrostatic gauge ﬁeld energy,

i.e. the ﬁrst term in brackets on the right - hand side of equation ( 171 ). The self - energy
˜E(e)
R and the mutual - interaction contribution ˆE(e)

Consequently, integrating here by parts does not result in the same cancellation mechanism

like that for the preceding external case ( 169 ). Instead, the following relationship between

Evidently, the electrostatic mass - energy ( 155 ) - ( 156 ) of both electrons does not cancel

against the gauge ﬁeld energy E(e)

R for the total energy ET ( 151 ) but, on the contrary,
has still to be subtracted from the sum of mass eigenvalues together with the additional

non - linear term N∗c2. Thus, the total energy ET ( 171 ) appears now as

Clearly, this is again a plausible result because the sum of mass eigenvalues ( ﬁrst term on the

right - hand side ) counts twice the interelectronic interaction energy of the electrostatic type

which therefore has to be subtracted once ( second term on the right - hand side ). Observe

also, that this electrostatic interaction energy, being deﬁned by the mean value of expressions
(a)A0. But an indirect
( 155 ) - ( 156 ), contains no manifest self - coupling of the form (a)k0 ·
self - coupling does clearly exist because the a - th potential (a)A0(r) is partly generated by

the b - th wave function ψb (a

= b), see the electrostatic Poisson equations ( 95 ) - ( 96 ).

D.

Internal Magnetostatic Interaction

After the role of the electrostatic interactions has been clariﬁed, one may turn attention

to the somewhat diﬀerent pattern of their magnetostatic counterparts. The mutual and

29

self - interaction parts of this type of interactions were identiﬁed in terms of the magnetic
ﬁelds ~Ha(~r) as [13]

It is true, this looks quite similar to the electrostatic counterpart ( 172 ) - ( 173 ) but observe

that for the magnetostatic interaction energy, in contrast to the electrostatic case, there is

no need of removing it from the matter energy ED ( 152 ). Another diﬀerence between both
types of interactions is the non - Abelian construction of the magnetostatic ﬁelds ~Ha(~r)

Despite the formal similarities of these magnetostatic energy contributions ˆE(m)
and ( 186 ) with their electromagnetic counterparts ˆE(e)

R ( 172 ) and ( 173 ) there is an
important diﬀerence which refers to the occurrence of direct self - interactions for the mag-

situation. The point with the magnetic case refers here to the occurrence of modiﬁed mag-

way:

This link clearly reveals the existence of direct self - interactions of the magnetic type since,
e.g., the second modiﬁed potential A′

2 in ( 189 ), on the one hand, combines with the wave

amplitudes R± of the ﬁrst particle, but on the other hand, it contains the ﬁrst potential

A1(r) which itself is generated just by the ﬁrst particle ( a = 1 )itself. In this way, the ﬁrst

E. Exchange Interactions

The last contribution to the total energy is the exchange energy EC, which is the energy

content of the exchange modes Gµν as speciﬁed by (C)Tµν ( 148 ), i.e.

EC =

d3~r (C)T00(~r) .

(194)

Since the energy - momentum density (C)Tµν ( 148 ) of the exchange modes splits up into an
“electric” part (h)Tµν and a magnetic part (g)Tµν, this splitting transcribes to the exchange

energy EC ( 194 ):

Concerning the “electric” part E(h)

C , it is true that both the exchange density h0(~r) and the
associated scalar exchange potential B0(~r) do vanish identically for the para - helium states
1S0. But nevertheless, the exchange ﬁeld strength ~X(~r) is non - trivial, cf. ( 135 ). Therefore,
the corresponding exchange energy E(h)
generally, in terms of the exchange ﬁeld strength ~X(~r) [13]

F. Special Case: ns2 1S0

As a check for the more general results concerning the states n1s n2s 1S0, return to
the subset of exactly isotropic states ns2 1S0 for which the total energy ET was previously

determined as [13]:

Observe the prefactor of three for the magnetostatic contribution E(m)
( 206 ) to the total
energy ET. It was shown in the preceeding articles [9, 17] that this threefold weight of E(m)
relative to E(e)
R is due to the exact isotropy of the states ns2 1S0, where each of the three

R

R

coordinate axis contributes the same amount to the spin - spin interaction energy.

The special form ( 206 ) of the energy functional ET is immediately obtainable from

the more general result ( 178 ) by use of the former identiﬁcations ( 78 ) - ( 83 ). They put
the exchange charge g∗ ( 131 ) to zero because the “electric” exchange ﬁeld strength ~X(~r)

vanishes as does the electrostatic potential diﬀerence ∆0(r) ( 133 ). As a consequence, both
normalisation parameters ˆza ( 126 ) - ( 127 ) adopt unity value, ˆza ⇒
reduces the general sum of mass eigenvalues occuring in the energy functional ET ( 178 ) to

1. In turn, this result

the special form ( 206 ):

Next, pay attention to the vanishing of the non - linear term N∗c2 ( 177 ) which is due to

the vanishing electrostatic potential diﬀerence ∆0(r) ( 133 ):

This is just the required result for the electromagnetic interaction energy E(e)

the states ns2 1S0.

Next, consider the general magnetostatic contributions ˆE(m)

Therefore, for the exactly isotropic states ns2 1S0, one adds up both equations ( 212 ) and

( 213 ) and thus ﬁnds the required special form ( 208 ).
To conclude matters, call your attention to E(h)

C ( 205 ), the yet uncon-
sidered exchange energy contributions of “electric” and “magnetic” type to the total energy
ET ( 178 ). Clearly, the “electric” contribution E(h)

C vanishes because of the vanishing elec-

So, in summary, the special form ( 206 ) of the energy functional ET for the exact isotropic

states does indeed emerge from the general shape ( 178 ), namely by substituting therein the

special results ( 209 ) - ( 215 ) referring to the states ns2 1S0.

XIII. NUMERICAL RESULTS

For a comparison of the present RST results to the experimental data and to the cor-

responding predictions of other theoretical approaches, observe that the literature mostly
presents ionisation energies ( J (1,n)

, say ) which refer to the states of the helium - like ions,

(2)

where one of both electrons occupies the groundstate (1s) and the other one is in an excited

state (ns).

Hence, comparing the various theoretical predictions for the chosen energy diﬀerence

∆theoE1−2 + Etheo|1s 2s 1S0 −

Etheo|1s2 1S0

(216)

among each other and all of them to the experimental values ∆expE1−2, has to be preceded
by transcribing the ionisation energies J (1,2)

theo(2) to the desired energy diﬀerence ( 216 ). This
can be easily done by simply observing that the concept of “ionisation energy” refers to the

energy diﬀerence between a ﬁnal state and an initial state, where in the ﬁnal state one of

both electrons is free, having energy Mc2, and the other one occupies a bound state with
energy E(1)
particle state of energy E(1,n)

theo(1). On the other hand, in the initial state both electrons do occupy a two -
theo(2). Thus, the theoretical ionisation energy J (1,n)
theo(2) is given by

35

J (1,n)
theo(2) = Mc2 + E(1)

E(1,n)

theo(2) .

theo(1) −

Putting now n = 1 and n = 2 , and subtracting the corresponding equations results in

the desired energy diﬀerence ∆theoE1−2:

∆theoE1−2 = J (1,1)

J (1,2)
theo(2) .

theo(2) −
theo(2) and J (1,2)

Here the two - particle ionisation energies J (1,1)

theo(2) may be taken from the vari-
ous theoretical approaches in the literature [11, 12], whereas for the one - particle energies
E(1)

theo(1) ( 217 ) the generally accepted values of ref. [19] are suitable.
It must be stressed that we restrict ourselves to a point - like and ﬁxed nucleus ( of charge

number 2

zex ≤

≤

100 ) so that the eﬀects due to mass polarisation and nuclear size are

neglected. Therefore, only the other contributions to the Lamb shifts of the one - and two -

electron conﬁgurations are taken into account. This can be made more concrete by represent-
ing the energy diﬀerence ∆theoE1−2 ( 218 ) as the sum of its “semiclassical” part ∆theo ˚E1−2

and the self - energy correction δsE1−2

∆theoE1−2 = ∆theo ˚E1−2 + δsE1−2 .

Here, the semiclassical contribution ∆theo ˚E1−2 is given in terms of the semi - classical ioni-
sation energies ˚J (1,n)

theo(2) as

∆theo ˚E1−2 = ˚J (1,1)

Accordingly, the self - energy correction δsE1−2 in the standard approaches is composed of

the QED corrections ( Lamb shift ) of the ionisation energies:

(217)

(218)

(219)

(220)

(223)

δsE1−2 = δsJ (1,1)

δsJ (1,2)

36

The conventional Lamb shifts δsJ (1,2)

theo(2) of the ionisation energies, with and without mass
polarisation and nuclear size eﬀects, are tabulated in ref. [11], so that a detailed comparison

with the corresponding RST predictions becomes now feasible.

A. Semiclassical Results

For the semiclassical approach, one neglects in the conventional theories the Lamb shift

which in RST corresponds to putting the self - interaction parameter u to zero. Under

these presumptions, Table I presents a comparison of the theoretical predictions for the
semiclassical energy diﬀerence ˚∆E1−2 due to the relativistic 1/Z-expansion method [11] and

RST. Here the RST procedure consists in solving numerically the mass eigenvalue problem

of Sect. X and taking the value of the energy functional ET

(178) upon the numerical

solutions.

The experimental values ∆expE1−2 [14] are also displayed in Table I, though it is clear

that their coincidence with the theoretical predictions can be achieved only after including

the self-energy eﬀects (see below).

In order to facilitate the analysis of the relationship

between theory and experiment, the numerical content of table I is illustrated by ﬁg.1
through displaying the relative deviations (˚∆) from the 1/Z expansion method:

(224b)

The semiclassical RST predictions ∆RST

E1−2 (7th column of Table I) deviate from

the experimental values ∆expE1−2 by 1, 4% for zex = 10 (neon) and decrease down to

0, 2% for zex = 42 (molybdenum). This eﬀect of improvement of the RST predictions for

increasing nuclear charge number zex is observed also in other situations, see ref.[13]; but in

view of the more precise 1/Z-predictions (4th column of Table I) this result requires some

explanation. The point here is that the energy diﬀerence ∆RST

E1−2 (220) is composed

of the two ionization energies

◦

(1,1)
RST(2) and

◦

J

(1,2)
RST(2) which therefore both do inﬂuence

the numerical value for ∆RST

E1−2. Here, the ground-state ionization energy

is calculated exactly and is found to be in suﬃcient agreement with the corresponding

(1,2)
RST(2) of the ﬁrst

excited state 1s 2s 1S0 is calculated by means of the spherically symmetric approximation

(see the remarks above the eigenvalue equations (91)-(94)); and this approximation

introduces an additional (albeit artiﬁcial) deviation which mainly is responsible for the

relatively large deviations of the semiclassical RST predictions from the experimental values.

Table I

This eﬀect may be exempliﬁed numerically, e.g., for nuclear charge number zex = 30

(zinc), cf. Table I. Here the 1/Z prediction amounts to ∆1/Z

E1−2= 8 955.4 eV and thus

◦

deviates from the experimental value ∆expE1−2 = 8 950.2 eV by 0.06%. In contrast to this,

the corresponding RST prediction is ∆RST

E 1−2= 8 912.2 eV and therefore has a deviation

◦

of 0.4%. However, this relatively large deviation is almost completely due to the ionization

energy

(1,2)
◦
RST(2)= 2 957.5 eV of the excited state, which deviates from the corresponding

J

◦

1/Z value

(1,2)
1/Z(2)= 2 915.67 eV by 1.4%. On the other hand, the RST prediction for the
(1,1)
RST(2)= 11 869.7 eV and therefore deviates

ionization energy (221) of the groundstate is

J

J

◦

from the corresponding 1/Z value

(1,1)
◦
1/Z(2)= 11 871.03 eV by only 0.01%. Consequently, it is

J

just the relatively inaccurate RST prediction

(1,2)
RST(2) for the excited state (being caused by
the spherically symmetric approximation) which is responsible for the large RST deviation

J

◦

from the experimental value. This result concretizes the necessity of developping some

methods to solve exactly the two-dimensional RST eigenvalue problems in order to avoid

the use of the spherically symmetric approximation. Alternatively, when one wishes to stick

to the spherically symmetric approximation, one might also look for a better class of trial

functions than those given by equations (49)-(52).

B. Self-Interactions

The inclusion of the electronic self-energy works somewhat diﬀerent in RST as in the

conventional theory: The RST self-interactions constitute an integral part of the theory,

namely in specifying the ﬁbre metric Kαβ (90) which must be ﬁxed in any way, no mat-

ter whether one wants to include or neglect the self-interactions. In contrast to this, the

self-interactions of the conventional theory are added by hand to the semiclassical results

ﬁg.1

38

in form of perturbative corrections due to quantum electrodynamics. The latter theory is a

rather diﬀerent framework which however is not able to yield immediately the desired energy

levels of atoms and molecules, so that one is forced to resort to a two-track procedure (i.e.

calculating semiclassical results and adding QED corrections). A typical example for this

is the relativistic 1/Z-expansion method of ref. [11] whose QED corrections have been used

also for the all-order technique in relativistic many-body perturbation theory [12].

Thus, it becomes interesting to oppose these rather diﬀerent approaches to each other

by comparing the QED-corrected semiclassical predictions ∆1/Z E1−2 of ref.s [11, 12] to

the analogous RST results ∆RST E1−2 with non-zero self-interaction parameter u. Here the

precise value of u is adopted as u = 0.03052, because for this value of u the electronic

ground-state interaction energies and ionization energies have been found to coincide ex-

cellently with the experimental facts for larger zex, see ref.s [10, 13]. Clearly one wishes

to know whether the self-interaction parameter u must adopt a universal value, or whether

perhaps it depends upon the quantum state to be considered. Table II and ﬁg.2 present

a comparison of the RST and 1/Z predictions ∆RSTE1−2 and ∆1/Z E1−2 with inclusion of

the self-energy eﬀects. The 1/Z data are directly taken over from ref. [11] with neglection

of mass polarization and nuclear size, and the corresponding RST data are obtained by

numerically solving the full RST mass-eigenvalue system ( 91 )-( 105 ) with u = 0.03052.

Concerning the QED corrected 1/Z predictions ∆1/ZE1−2 ([11]) (fourth column of Ta-

ble II), the inclusion of the QED self-interactions yields an acceptable agreement with the

experimental data up to medium nuclear charge numbers (zex . 50), see also ﬁg.2. Here

the inclusion of the QED self-energy actually generates a considerable improvement.

In

contrast to this, the inclusion of the RST self-interactions (by taking u = 0.03052) results in

an ambiguous shift of the energy diﬀerence ∆RSTE1−2 (( 218 )), see seventh column of Table

II. For lower zex (< 28), the inclusion of the RST self-interactions shifts the RST predic-

tions ∆RSTE1−2 (( 218 )) closer to the experimental data, whereas for the higher zex (> 28)

the corresponding RST predictions move apart from the experimental values. However, the

semiclassical tendency of better appoximation for the higher nuclear charge numbers does

persist also after inclusion of the self-interactions.

ﬁg.2

39

In this sense, RST seems to represent some kind of high-energy approximation to the real

world. Indeed, this feature of RST is even more manifest for the ground-state ionization

energies of the helium-like ions, for which the RST predictions are more precise than the

predictions of the other theoretical approaches in the literature [13]. Clearly, such a result

hints at the unexhausted potentiality of RST, where it seems possible to further improve

the RST predictions by ﬁnding approximations to the exact solutions which supersede the

present trial functions in combination with the variational technique.

Table II: Energy Diﬀerences ∆E1

2 with Self-Interaction

The semiclassical predictions for the energy diﬀerence ∆E1−2 become improved considerably

for the conventional 1/Z expansion method but only partly for RST by including the self-energy

eﬀects. The moderate precision of the RST predictions is a consequence of the use of (i) the

spherically symmetric approximation and (ii) the simple one-particle trial functions ( 49 ) - ( 52 ).

It is only the use of these very rough approximations which devaluates the RST predictions down

to the level of the simple Hartree-Fock approach.

Fig.1: Relative Deviations

∆ (224a)-(224b)

◦

The relative semiclassical deviations from the experimental values (H) are larger for the RST

approach ((cid:7)) than for the 1/Z expansion method [11] because the spherically symmetric

approximation of RST induces an extra (albeit artiﬁcial) deviation in addition to the missing of

the correlation energy beyond Hartree-Fock. For high nuclear charge numbers zex, the RST

predictions ((cid:7)) approximate the 1/Z predictions (horizontal axis). For this asymptotic

(zex >> 1) coincidence of RST and 1/Z predictions see ref.[13].

44

Fig.2: Relative Deviations (224a)-(224b) with Self-Interactions

The inclusion of the QED corrections yields a considerable improvement of the 1/Z

predictions (H), see ﬁg.1; whereas the modiﬁcation of the RST predictions ((cid:7)) is ambiguous:

improvement for low zex(< 28) but deterioration for the higher zex (> 28). This is interpreted as

an artiﬁcal eﬀect due to the use of the spherically symmetric approximation in combination with

the simple one - particle trial functions ( 49 ) - ( 52 ).

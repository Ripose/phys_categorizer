We analyse the extraction of a coherent atomic beam from
a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate using a rf transition to a
non-trapping state at T=0 K. Our quantum treatment fully
takes gravity into account but neglects all interactions in the
free falling beam. We obtain an analytical expression of the
output rate and of the wave function of the extracted beam,
i.e. the output mode of the “atom laser”. Our model repro-
duces satisfactorily experimental data without any adjustable
parameter.

Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) of dilute alkali va-
pors [1] represents a potential source of matter waves for
atom interferometry, since it has been proven [2] that
they are inherently coherent. Various schemes for “atom
lasers” have been used to extract a coherent matter wave
out of a trapped BEC. Pulsed devices were demonstrated
by using a spin-ﬂip radio frequency (rf) pulse [3], Raman
transitions [4] or gravity-induced tunneling from an op-
tically trapped BEC [5]. Later on, a quasi-continuous
atom laser has been demonstrated by using a weak rf
ﬁeld that continuously couples atoms into a free falling
state [6]. This “quasi-continuous” atom laser promises
spectacular improvements in applications of atom optics,
for example in the performances of atom-interferometer-
based inertial sensors [7].
Gravity plays a crucial role in outcouplers with spin-ﬂip
rf transitions: it determines the direction of propagation
of the matter wave, as well as its amplitude and phase.
However, to our knowledge, most of the theoretical stud-
ies of rf couplers do not take gravity into account. This is
the case in the numerical treatments of [8–10], and in the
semi-classical analytical approaches of [11,12]. Gravity
has been included in a 3D numerical treatment restricted
to very short pulses [14], relevant for the experiment of
[3], and in the 1D simulation of [13], relevant for the ex-
periment of [6], with which it agrees only qualitatively.
In this paper, we present a quantum 3D analytical treat-
ment fully taking gravity into account. After a short
presentation of the basic equations, assumptions and ap-
proximations of our model, we identify the weak coupling
regime relevant to the quasi-continuous atom laser. We
obtain an analytic expression for the atom laser wave
function and for the output rate, from which we derive a

2 M (ω2

generalized rate equation for the trapped BEC. We then
show that our model reproduces satisfactorily the exper-
imental results of [6], without any adjustable parameter.
We consider a 87Rb BEC in the F = 1 hyperﬁne level
at T = 0 K. The m =-1 state is conﬁned in a harmonic
magnetic potential Vtrap = 1
⊥z2). A
rf magnetic ﬁeld Brf = Brf cos (ωrf t)ex can induce tran-
sitions to m =0 (non-trapping state) and m =+1 (ex-
pelling state). The coupling matrix element is ¯hΩrf /2,
with the Rabi frequency Ωrf = µBBrf /¯h2√2 (gF =-
1/2 is the Land´e g factor). Within the Hartree-Fock
approximation, the condensate three-component spinor
wavefunction Ψ
m]m=−1,0,+1 obeys a coupled non
linear Schr¨odinger equation [8]. As in [11], we make
the rotating wave approximation and the transformation
′ = ψmeimωrf t, and we consider the “weak coupling
ψm
limit”. In this limit to be deﬁned more precisely later,
the Rabi frequency is low enough that the populations
Nm of the three Zeeman sublevels obey the following in-
equality: N+1 ≪ N0 ≪ N−1. In the rest of this paper,
we therefore restrict ourselves to m =-1 and m =0, and
set the total atomic density n(r) ≈| ψ−1(r, t) |2. Finally,
we neglect all interactions in the free falling state (we
discuss later this approximation).

with h−1 = Voﬀ − ¯hωrf + p2/2M + Vtrap + U | ψ−1 |2
and h0 = p2/2M − M gz. The origin of the z axis
is at the center of the condensate, displaced by grav-
ity from the magnetic ﬁeld minimum (zsag = g/ω2
⊥).
We have taken the zero of energy at z = 0 in m =0,
so that the level splitting at the bottom of the trap is
Voﬀ = µBB0/2 + M g2/2ω2
⊥ (B0 is the bias ﬁeld). Inter-
actions are described by U = 4π¯h2a/M (a ≈ 5 nm ).

We will expand the two components of the wavefunc-
tion onto the eigenstates φm of the uncoupled “eﬀective
hamiltonian” (taking Ωrf = 0 in Eq.(1)). For the m =-1
sublevel, we solve for the ground state in the Thomas-
Fermi (TF) approximation [15]

⊥)1/3).
The energy of the uncoupled eigenstates is E−1=Voﬀ +
µ − ¯hωrf . In the following, we will take typical values
corresponding to the situation of [6]: N = 7 × 105 atoms
initially, ωx=2π × 20 Hz and ω⊥=2π × 180 Hz, which
gives x0 ≈ 55 µm , z0 ≈ 5 µm and µ/h ≈ 2.2 kHz.
For the m =0 state, the hamiltonian of equation (1b)
with Ωrf =0 is separable. In the horizontal plane (x,y),
the eigenstates are plane waves with wavevectors kx,ky
that we quantize with periodic boundaries conditions
in a 2D box of size L. Consquently, wavefunction is
0 (x, y) = L−1ei(kxx+kyy) and the density of states is
φ⊥
ρxy = L2/4π2. Along the vertical direction z, we must
solve the usual 1D Schr¨odinger equation for a free falling
(zEz )
= A.Ai(−ζEz ),
particle [16]. The exact solution is φ
0
where Ai is the Airy function of the ﬁrst kind taken for
the reduced variable ζEz = (z − zEz )/l. The classical
turning point zEz = −Ez/mg associated with the verti-
cal energy Ez labels the vertical solution. We deﬁned the
length scale l = (¯h2/2M 2g)1/3 such that l ≪ x0, y0, z0
(for 87Rb, l ≈ 0.28µm). In the following, we will rather
use the WKB approximation which reads:

This amounts to taking the asymptotic form of Ai.
If we quantize φ(zEz )
by imposing a node on a ‘’ﬁc-
titious” barrier at position z=H (that can be arbi-
trarily large), and neglect the contribution of the in-
[−∞, zEz ], where Ai falls oﬀ very quickly, we
terval
obtain the normalization factor A=(π/l)1/2α−1

αH =((H − zEz )/l)1/4 (we have replaced the rapidly os-
cillating cos2 term by 1/2). The density of longitudinal
modes is ρz(zEz )=(1/2πl)α2
H. Finally, the output modes
are given by φ(n)

this problem is the resonant bell-shape of the coupling

[17]), the above overlap integral is non-vanishing only if
zEz belongs to [−z0, z0] (within a negligible uncertainty

which gives a resonance condition for the frequency ωrf

Here and in the following, we neglect the transverse ki-
netic energy ¯h2k2/2M (we will discuss this point later).

FIG. 1. Atom laser in the weak coupling regime. 1a : time
evolution of the laser intensity. For t ≫ tc, the numerical
integration of Eq.(1) agrees with the output rate of Eq.(5).
1b : Spatial intensity proﬁle of the atom laser at t ≫ tc
according to Eq.(6)

We can describe the outcoupler dynamics by using the
results of [18] for the coupling of a discrete level to a
continuum.
If the coupling matrix element takes sig-
niﬁcant values only for a ﬁnite range ∆ in energy, two
diﬀerent situations can be distinguished. In the strong
coupling regime (hΓ ≫ ∆, where Γ is the transition rate
given by the Fermi golden rule), the discrete level ex-
hibits Rabi oscillations with the narrow-band continuum.
This describes the pulsed atom laser experimentally re-
alized by Mewes et al. [3]). On the contrary, in the weak
coupling limit (hΓ ≪ ∆), oscillations persist only for
t ≤ tc=h/∆ ∼ 0.05ms. We have veriﬁed this behaviour
on a 1D numerical integration analogous to [13] Fig.(1a).
For t ≥ tc, the decay of the discrete level is monotonous
with a rate Γ, which is calculated in Appendix A :

Quasi-continuous output corresponds to the weak cou-

cal Rabi frequency (for which hΓ ∼ ∆) ΩC

energy. In this approximation, ﬁrst order time dependent
perturbation theory (valid for tc ≤ t ≤ Γ−1) also gives
an analytical expression for the outcoupled atomic wave
function, i.e. the atom laser mode (see Fig.(1b)):

from the expression of Γ.

(7)

We now model the time evolution of the number of
trapped atoms N−1. Intuitively, one would write a rate
equation using Eq.(5). However, the non linearity aris-
ing from the dependence of the output rate with N−1
should not be neglected and we assume that the con-
densed state adiabatically follows the evolution of the
TF solution calculated with the time varying chemical
potential [19]. With this approximation, the Wigner-
Weisskopf treatment leads, after integration over space,
to the non linear rate equation:

dN−1

dt

= −Γ[N−1] N−1

(8)

We can now compare our model to the data of Bloch
et al [6].
Integrating Eq.(8) with the output rate (5),
we have calculated the number of atoms remaining in
the condensate after a ﬁxed time with their experimental
parameters as a function of the rf frequency. A shown
Fig.(2a), the model agrees with the experimental data
for the | F = 1; mF = −1i . In the | F = 2; mF = 2i case
the second trapping state | F = 2; mF = 1i has to be
included. The resolvent operator allows to treat the res-
onant coupling between two discrete levels, with the ﬁrst
level also coupled to a continuum (decay rate Γ2,1) [18].
If the coupling is strang (Γ2,2 = Γ2,1/2 if Ωrf ≫ Γ2,1),
the second level acquires a decay rate Γ2,2 = Γ2,1/2 if
Ωrf ≫ Γ2,1. We have taken this value as a ﬁrst approxi-
mation. This leads to a good agreement with the exper-
imental data (Fig.2b).

We now discuss our approximations in the case of
weak coupling. Since hΓ ≪ mgz0, the spatial region
where outcoupling takes place, of vertical extension δz ∼
hΓ/mg, is very thin compared to the BEC size. This al-
lows to loof at the outcoupling process in a semi classical
way, in analogy with a Franck-Condon principle [9]: the

0

coupling happens at the turning point of the classical tra-
jectory of the free falling atoms. Using this semi classical
point of view, we can verify our assumptions. Our ﬁrst
approximation consists of neglecting the transverse ki-
netic energy. A typical wavevector y−1
corresponds to a
typical kinetic energy δE ∼ ¯h2/2M y2
0 ≪ ∆ (δE ∼ 20 Hz
for y0 ∼ 5µm). Neglecting δE amounts to approximate
the Franck-Condon surfaces (surfaces of equal energy) by
a plane. This is correct since, over the size of the BEC,
the surface curvature is small, so that the deviation from
this plane is negligible compared to z0. This approxima-
tion also entails that the atom laser wave function has
plane wave fronts [21]. Our second approximation con-
sists of omitting the interaction term in the output. In
other words, we have assumed that the gravitational po-
tential acting on the free falling atoms was only slightly
distorted by the interaction energy within the BEC. The
validity of this can be checked by comparing the mean-
ﬁeld energy and the gradient of the gravitational poten-
tial over the condensate. This ratio is proportional to
µ/∆ ∼ 0.1 ≪ 1. Gravity is thus the dominant term,
although interactions may still play a signiﬁcant role, es-
pecially in the transverse shape of the wave function.
To conclude, in this paper we have obtained analytical
expressions for the output rate and the output mode of
a quasi-continuous atom laser based on rf outcoupling
from a trapped BEC. Our quantum treatment, which
fully takes gravity and the 3D geometry into account,
leads to a good agreement with the experimental results
of Ref. [6]. Our model can easily be adapted to more so-
phisticated situations. For instance, it can describe the
weak coupling of a trapped BEC to a magnetic cavity,
i.e. a smooth magnetic trap for m = 0 produced by the
quadratic Zeeman eﬀect [23]. Our model can still be im-
proved by including the eﬀects of interactions in the free
beam, diﬀraction and ﬁnite-temperature [10].

APPENDIX A: OUTPUT RATE

We detail here the evaluation of the output rate. We
set ˜k2 = (kxx0)2 + (kyy0)2 and work out the overlap in-
tegral I between a free mode φ(n)
and the condensate
wavefunction function φ−1 treated in the TF approxi-
mation. We write it in reduced cylindrical coordinates
( ˜rT , θ, ˜z). Integration of ei˜k ˜rT cos θ over θ yields a 2πJ0
term in the transverse integral, that we integrate over ˜rT
to obtain:

where g(p) = (p cos p − sin p)/p3, and p(˜k, ˜z) = ˜k(1 −
˜z2)1/2. We set u = z/l, and extend the integral over
the real axis since u0 = z0/l ≫ 1. Next, we use
the Parseval relation, and introduce the Fourier trans-
forms of g, ˜g and of Ai(x), eiu3/3. We have to calculate
R ∞
−∞ ˜g(˜k, vu0)ei(v3/3−vuEz )dv. As the function ˜g takes ﬁ-
nite values on a small neighborhood of the origin (of size
u−1
0 ≪ 1), we can keep only the lowest order term in
the phase, which gives the inverse Fourier transform of
˜g taken in z = zEz . This can be shown more rigorously
with help of the Lebesgue theorem on uniform conver-
gence [17]. This yields the simple expression:

The multiply diﬀerential cross section of the ionization of hydrogen molecular ion by fast electron
impact is calculated by a direct approach, which involves the reduction of the initial 6D Schr¨odinger
equation to a 3D evolution problem followed by the modeling of the wave packet dynamics. This
approach avoids the use of stationary Coulomb two-centre functions of the continuous spectrum of
the ejected electron which demands cumbersome calculations. The results obtained, after veriﬁcation
of the procedure in the case atomic hydrogen, reveal interesting mechanisms in the case of small
scattering angles.

I. INTRODUCTION

New experimental methods, particularly, based on the
multiple coincidence detection technique [1–3] stimulate
the interest to fundamental theoretical studies of the dis-
sociative ionization of diatomic molecules by electron im-
pact. In this context the molecular hydrogen ion can be
considered as the basic system in which the removal of the
unique electron causes dissociation. Substantial theoret-
ical analysis of the dissociative ionization of H+
2 by fast
electrons was recently carried out in [4]. As mentioned
in [4], the crucial point of calculating the cross-section
of such processes is that no closed exact analytical wave
functions of the continuum states exist. In [4] the ﬁnal-
state wave function of the ejected electron was found by
taking a product of two approximate functions that take
into account the two scattering centers. To improve the
calculation it seems straightforward to obtain these func-
tions with the exact numerical solutions of the two-center
continuum problem. However, this approach involves a
cumbersome procedure of calculating multi-dimensional
integrals of the functions presented numerically that re-
quires huge computer facilities and may cause additional
computational problems. It seems reasonable to search
for direct computational approaches, in which the basis
of exact two-center continuum wave functions is not in-
volved. Note that the potential advantage of such meth-
ods is that they could be generalized over a wider class of
two-center systems starting from the molecular hydrogen
ion as a test object. In the present paper we develop a
direct approach to the ionization of hydrogen molecular
ion by fast electrons that involves the reduction of the ini-

1

tial 6D Schr¨odinger equation to a 3D evolution problem
followed by modeling of the wave packet dynamics.

Originally we intended to treat the incoming elec-
tron classically, its trajectory being approximated by a
straight line with the deﬂection neglected. The bound
electron was to be treated quantum mechanically. Pre-
liminary calculations at the impact parameter ρ = 10
a.u. has shown, ﬁrst, that the probability of the emission
of the electron having the energy of 50 eV is extremely
small, and, second, that the direction of the electron
emission is orthogonal to that of the incoming electron
motion, that contradicts the results of [4]. This means
that the main contribution to the small-angle scattering
comes from the central collisions with the bound electron
in the region of its localization. Generally, the classically
estimated deﬂection angle of 1o for scattered electron cor-
responds to the impact parameter of the order of 1 a.u.,
so that the trajectory passes through the molecule and
the classical treatment of the incoming electron is not
valid.

Here we develop and apply a direct approach to the
calculation of the angular distribution of scattered and
ejected electrons that involves the reduction of the ini-
tial 6D Schr¨odinger equation to a 3D evolution problem
followed by modeling of the wave packet dynamics. The
approach does not make use of the basis of stationary
Coulomb two-center functions of the continuous spec-
trum for the ejected electron, whose proper choice is a
crucial point of other model calculations. Our approach
can be considered as the linearized version of the phase
function method [5,6] for the multi-dimensional scatter-
ing problem. The evolution problem is solved using the

method based on the split-step technique [7] with com-
plex scaling, recently proposed by some of us and tested
in paraxial optics [8]. In the present paper the method
as a whole is also tested using the well known problem of
electron scattering by hydrogen atom [9].

II. BASIC EQUATIONS

We start from the 6D stationary Schr¨odinger equation
which describes two electrons in the ﬁeld of two ﬁxed
protons

Neglecting the large-angle scattering one can write the
initial condition for ψ as

ψ(r, R⊥,−∞) = ψ0(r).

(3)

To solve the 5D Schr¨odinger evolution equation(2) we
use Fourier transformation with respect to the variable
R⊥

ψ(r, R⊥, Z) =

1

2π Z ψk⊥(r, Z) exp(ik⊥R⊥)dR⊥.

(4)

Then Eq.(2) takes the form

(cid:20)H0(r) −

r+U (r) is Hamiltonian
of ejected electron in the ﬁeld of two protons, V (r, R) =
U (R) + Uint(r, R) is the interaction between the impact
electron and molecular ion, U (r) = −1/r1 − 1/r2 is the
attractive potential between the ejected (scattered) elec-
tron and the protons, r1 = |r − r1p|, r2 = |r − r2p|,
rip is the radius-vector of the i-th proton, Uint(r, R) =
1/|r− R| is the repulsive potential of interaction between
the electrons. The origin of the coordinate frame is cho-
sen in the center of symmetry of the molecular ion with
the Z axis directed along the momentum of the incident
electron.

For the scattering problem solved here the energy of
the system may be presented as E = k2
i /2 + E0, where
−E0 is the ionization potential, ki is the momentum of
the incident electron. Let us seek the solution of Eq.(1)
in the form Ψ(r, X, Y, Z) = ψ(r, R⊥, Z) exp(ikiZ). Un-
der the condition that (k2
i << 1 one can
neglect the second derivative of ψ with respect to Z. As a
result we get the evolution-like equation for the envelope
function ψ(r, R⊥, Z)

Further simpliﬁcation of the problem is possible if the
amplitude of the incident wave is much greater than that
of the scattered wave. In this case one can put

ψk⊥(r, Z) = δ(k⊥)ψ0(r)

(7)

in the integral term of Eq.(5). As a result we get the
inhomogeneous equation

variables in the expression for Vk⊥ (r, Z) it is easier to
start from the known integral

Here k⊥ = ki sin θs is the transverse momentum compo-
nent of the scattered electron, θs is the scattering angle,
±d are the positions of the nuclei with respect to the
center of symmetry. Note that terms in square brackets
determine the elastic scattering of the incident electron
by the nuclei.

Due to the exponential decrease of the source term
with |Z| the integration may be actually carried out
within a certain ﬁnite interval (−Zmax, Zmax). Hence
the zero initial condition should be imposed at the point
−Zmax.
Note that the approximation (7) is actually equivalent
to the ﬁrst Born approximation [9]. Multiply Eq.(8) by
the complex conjugate function of the continuous spec-
trum of ˆH0 and integrate over all r. Then

where Ck⊥(ke, Z) =R ψ∗(ke, r)ψk⊥(r, Z)dr is the proba-

bility density amplitude for the transition of the initially
bound electron into the state with the momentum ke.
Let us substitute

Ck⊥ (ke, Z) = ˜Ck⊥ (ke, Z) exp(ikZZ),

where kZ is the increment of the longitudinal component
of the momentum of the impact electron determined by
the relation

(15)

where ks = ki − K is the momentum of the scattered
electron, K = (−kX ,−kY ,−kZ) is the momentum trans-
fer.
Provided that the ejected electron has the momentum
ke, the asymptotic form of the solution of Eq. (1) for the
wave function of the scattered electron when R → ∞ is

The scattering diﬀerential cross-section(DCS) can be

mation.

III. CALCULATION OF THE ANGULAR

The asymptotic expression of the radial part of the
wave function corresponding to the continuous spectrum
of ˆH0 can be written as

E (r, t) =

is the evolution variable, υ(r) =
2 − E0, U as(r) = −Z ′/r,
Z ′ = 2 is charge of two protons. In the asymptotic limit
one can take only the radial component of the momen-
tum of the ejected electron into account. Then, accord-
ing to [10], the expression for calculating the amplitude
A(k, θ, φ) takes the form

The amplitudes deﬁned by (22) are related with the

|Ak⊥(ke, θe, φe)|2 = ke(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

˜Ck⊥(ke,∞)(cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12)

Using (17),(20) and (24) we get the ﬁnal expression for
the diﬀerential cross-section

2

(24)

σke (θs, φs) = (2π)2kski |Ak⊥(ke, θe, φe)|2 .

(25)

In the region where r > rmax we made use of the com-
plex scaling technique [11] to suppress the non-physical
reﬂection from the grid boundary.

IV. NUMERICAL SCHEME

The inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger equation to be solved

can be written as

i

∂Ψ(r, t)

∂t

= ˆH0(r)Ψ(r, t) + F (r, t),

(26)

The solution of Eq. (26) to within the second-order terms
in ∆t can be expressed as the following sequence of equa-
tions:

(29)

Ψ(t + ∆t) = Ψ1

F (r, t + ∆t).

The key step of the procedure is Eq.
(28) which de-
ﬁnes nothing but Cranck-Nicholson scheme. To solve this
equation we make use of the partial coordinate splitting
(PCS). A ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme is applied for the radial
variable r and the polar angle θ. Fast Fourier transform
(FFT) is used for the azimuthal angle φ.

In the spherical coordinate system, the z-axis of which
is directed along the symmetry axis of the molecule (and
not along the velocity of the impact electron) and after
the substitution Ψ = ψ/r and the Fourier transformation
of Eq.(28) the terms ˆH0Ψ0,1
entering this equation turn
into

j2j1 of the diﬀerential opera-
tors entering Eq.(28) yields M sets of linear equations,
each set being of the order L × N , where M, L and N
are the numbers of grid points in φ, η and r, respectively.
Direct solution of each set of equations requires N L2 op-
erations at each step in t. The FFT that should be per-
formed twice, ﬁrst, when proceeding from (27) to (28),
and second, from (28) to (29), requires N LM log2 M ex-
tra operations.

To reduce the number of operation we propose a
double-cycle split-step scheme. In case when ˆH0 can be
presented as a sum ˆH0 = ˆH1 + ˆH2, this scheme can be
formulated as follows

ψ1 = ψ(t);
ˆH1)ψ2 = (I − i
ˆH2)ψ3 = (I − i
ˆH2)ψ4 = (I − i

which to within the second-order terms in ∆t corresponds
to the initial Cranck-Nicholson scheme, I and H1,2 is
square matrixes, (I)i2i1j2j1 = δi2i1δj2j1.

Now the problem is how to split the Hamiltonian ˆH0
into two parts. Formal separation of radial and angular
parts leads to diﬃculties associated with the singularity
of the angular part. Due to this singularity the scheme
appears to be conditionally stable with severe limitations
imposed on the step ∆t. Practically this version of the
splitting scheme is applicable only if the grid in r is rough
enough.

To remove this limitation we propose a partial coor-
dinate splitting scheme. Its principal idea is that in the
vicinity of r = 0 it is preferable not to split oﬀ the angu-
lar part at all. To implement this idea we introduce the
r-dependent weight function p(r) which is supposed to
diminish in the vicinity of r = 0 and deﬁne the discrete
approximation of the operators ˆH1,2 in the following way

expression obtained in the ﬁrst Born approximation [12].
Good agreement was demonstrated in the energy interval
of interest Ee from 1 to 3 a.u., Ee being the energy of
the ejected electron.

where ra is the radius of the vicinity of r = 0 where the
splitting is absent, ap is the width of the area of partial
splitting. Such a polynomial satisﬁes the condition of
smooth connection at the boundaries that separate the
region of partial splitting from the regions of full split-
ting, on one hand, and of no splitting at all, on another
hand.

Our numerical studies concerning the molecular hydro-
gen ion focused on the variation of the multi-fold diﬀer-
ential cross section (MDCS) concerning a coincidence de-
tection of the two emerging electrons and one of the pro-
tons with the ejection angle θe at diﬀerent orientations of
the molecular axis, provided that the scattering angle is
small. The examples of our results illustrated by Figs.2-5
are obtained under the following conditions: the momen-
tum of the impact electron ki =12.13 a.u. (Ei ≃ 2000
eV); the angle of scattering θs = 1o. The impact and
ejected electron trajectories and the molecular axis are
supposed to lie in one plane. The latter restriction is
not imposed by the method as such, it is just an ex-
ample. Generally, one gets full information about the
ejected electron, i.e., the dependence of MDCS from Ee,
θe and φe, after each run of the code at given values of
the impact energy, scattering angle and molecular axis
orientation. In Fig.2 demonstrates the energy-angle dis-
tribution, extracted from the data getting in result of one
run of the code. In the planar geometry the orientation
of the molecular ion is determined by a single angle θd be-
tween the impact direction and the internuclear axis. We
remind that the momentum transfer vector was deﬁned
above as K = ki − ks. In Figs. 3 we present the par-
ticular cases of the dependence of MDCS upon θe when
internuclear axis is a)parallel to the momentum transfer;
b)perpendicular to the momentum transfer; c)parallel to
the impact electron direction ki; d)perpendicular to the
impact electron direction ki. As it could be expected
basing on the elementary symmetry considerations, the
ﬁrst two plots are symmetric with respect to the direction
of the momentum transfer that corresponds to the angle
θe = 319.2o. Since this symmetry is not assumed a pri-
ori in the procedure, this may be considered as one more
evidence in favour of the validity of the results demon-
strated.

electron and the probability of the ionization is maximal.
This is conﬁrmed around θe = 319.2o on ﬁgures 3(a) and
3(b) where the inter-nuclear axis is respectively perpen-
dicular and parallel to K. So this is a good veriﬁcation for
our calculation. Now, for the situation where ke is anti-
parallel to K, the recoil momentum Qrecoil is maximal
and the probability of the ionization is maximal. This
is also visible for θe = 139.2o. Now for the directions of
the internuclear axis other than θd = 139.2o (where d is
parallel to K) or θd = 49.2o (where d is perpendicular to
K) the target does not respect the above analysis. This
is due to the fact that the diatomic target behaves as an
atomic target only for these two angles. The other situ-
ations present interference patterns the minima of which
move when θd changes.

Fig.4 shows MDCS versus the ejection angle θe and in-
ternuclear angle θd. As one can see, this dependence has
rather a complex behaviour.

FIG. 5. The multi-fold diﬀerential cross section of the ion-
ization of H +
2 as a function of the angle θd between the im-
pact direction and the internuclear axis for ﬁxed ejection angle
θe = 319.2o. The energy of the ejected electron is Ee = 1.85
a.u.

To conﬁrm the above dependence we show in Fig.5
a section of Fig.4 for ﬁxed ejection angle θe = 319.2o
which corresponds to the case when the ejected electron
direction is parallel to the momentum transfer vector. It
presents a variation of the MDCS with respect to the di-
rection of the inter-nuclear axis. It can be clearly seen
that the maximal value of MDCS is achieved when the in-
ternuclear axis is perpendicular to the momentum trans-
fer direction that correspond to θd = 49.2o. This result
agrees with the hypothesis formulated in [13].

FIG. 4. The multi-fold diﬀerential cross section (MDCS) of
the ionization of H +
2 versus the ejection angle θe and molec-
ular angle θd. The energy of the ejected electron Ee = 1.85
a.u.=50.3 eV.

VI. CONCLUSION

The recoil momentum Qrecoil = K − ke transmitted
to the target has its minimum for ke parallel to K. In
this case all the momentum is transferred to the ejected

We have developed a procedure which determines the
multiply diﬀerential cross section of the (e,2e) ionization
of hydrogen molecular ion by fast electron impact, us-
ing a direct approach which reduces the problem to a

3D evolution problem solved numerically. Our method
avoids the cumbersome stationary perturbative calcula-
tions, and opens the way for near future applications to
the (e,2e) ionization of more complex atomic and molec-
ular targets.

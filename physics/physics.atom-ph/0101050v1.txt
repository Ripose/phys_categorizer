Abstract

Quadrupole moment of the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld B = 0–
4.414 × 1013 G is calculated by two diﬀerent methods. The ﬁrst method is
variational based on a single trial function. The second method deals with
a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation in a form of a linear combination
of the Landau orbitals.

1 Introduction

Plenty of works were devoted to the hydrogen atom in a magnetic ﬁeld (see,
e.g., reviews [1–3]). This problem was among the ﬁrst ones ever studied in
quantum mechanics. To a great extent, a reason for such interest is due to
its importance in various branches of fundamental physics: astrophysics, spec-
troscopy, solid state, and plasma physics. From the physical point of view, the
ﬁrst appearances of the inﬂuence of a magnetic ﬁeld B on the atom are (i)
changes of binding energies, including the Zeeman level splitting which takes
oﬀ the degeneracy, and (ii) a development of a non-vanishing quadrupole mo-
BaBb as a consequence of a deformation of the spherical-symmetric
ment Qab ∝
atomic shape. In contrast to the former phenomenon, the latter one has not
been thoroughly studied. Meanwhile, the appearance of the quadrupole mo-
ment leads to a drastic change in interaction of atoms. A standard van der
Waals attraction originated from the interaction of induced dipoles is overtaken
Q2/R5, which is repulsive when
by the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction E
atoms are situated along magnetic line (see [4, 5]). In many applications (for
instance, for construction of the equation of state), one needs to include the ef-
fects of atom-atom interactions. For example, a study of pressure ionization of
a strongly magnetized hydrogen plasma is performed in [6] in a simple occupa-
tion probability model, which is based on a calculation of quantum-mechanical
atomic sizes [7]. This model is fully adequate at suﬃciently high temperatures
T . However, in order to extend a domain of applicability to lower T , where
neutral fraction is large, electrical multipole interactions of atoms should be
taken into account. Therefore the quadrupole-quadrupole interaction can be
signiﬁcant at certain plasma parameters.

∝

For various quantum-mechanical states of the H atom in a magnetic ﬁeld,
there have been accurate calculations of binding energies [8,9], oscillator strengths
[10], and photoionization rates [11]. Moreover, binding energies [7, 12, 13], ge-
ometrical sizes and oscillator strengths [7, 13], and photoionization cross sec-
tions [14] have been successfully calculated also for an atom moving in a strong
magnetic ﬁeld (equivalent to an atom in crossed magnetic and electric ﬁelds),
which is an essentially three-dimensional system. Despite this progress, up to
now the quadrupole moment was not basically studied with probably a single ex-
ception [15]. A goal of present Report is to carry out such a study for the ground
state using (i) variational method and (ii) a method based on a solution of
the Schr¨odinger equation by expansion in the Landau orbitals with coordinate-
dependent coeﬃcients. We explore the range of magnetic ﬁeld strengths B from
0 to the “relativistic” ﬁeld Br ≡

3 Variational method

In order to construct an adequate variational trial function Ψ0, we follow a recipe
formulated in [19–21]. Namely, the potential V0 = (∆Ψ0)/Ψ0 should reproduce
the Coulomb singularity at the origin and the harmonic oscillator behavior at
large distances. Furthermore, the trial function should have correct functional
expansion in coordinates at small and large distances from the origin, as well as
correct expansion in powers of B. Since the ground state wavefunction has no
nodal surfaces in the conﬁguration space, we may write Ψ0 = e−φ, where φ is a
smooth real function of coordinates. Asymptotic behavior of this function has
been calculated in [15, 22]:

φ =

These expansions prompt to choose the following seven-parametric trial func-
tion:

(cf. [15, 21]), where a, α1−4, b1−2 are variational parameters. One can check
that the eﬀective potential V0 corresponding to this trial function reproduces
correctly the potential in Eq. (1) at r

0 (Coulomb regime) and at ρ

(Landau regime). Furthermore, Eq. (6) gives a correct functional form of

the ﬁrst corrections in powers B2 to the exponential phase of the ground-state
wavefunction (see [22]) and, even more important, the functional form of the
Bρ2 at large distances (for a
ﬁrst correction to the Landau phase factor

information on the ground-state wavefunction of the Hamiltonian (1).

If there were no Coulomb attraction, then the transverse part of the wave-

5 Results and discussion

The results of our calculations of binding energy E and the quadrupole moment
Qzz are given in Table 1. When available we make comparison with the most
accurate up-to-date results for the binding energy [9].

The variational approach of Sect. 3 based on a single seven-parametric func-
tion (6) gives very high relative accuracy in binding energy of the order of 10−7
at small magnetic ﬁelds which then falls to 10−2 at the largest studied magnetic
ﬁelds. Basically, it corresponds to the same absolute accuracy 10−7 in the total
energy for the whole explored range of magnetic ﬁelds. Two major parameters

Other parameters also vary smoothly and slow.

For the second method of Sec.4 we retain n, n′ = 0, 1, . . . , 12 in the system
1 using the algorithm
of equations (9) and solve it for the ground state at γ
described in Ref. [7]. Then we calculate Qzz from Eq. (2) using Eqs. (12), (13).
From Table 1, we see that the method of expansion in the Landau orbitals
turns out to be more accurate at γ & 10, whereas the variational method of

Sect. 3 is superior at lower ﬁeld strengths. This is conﬁrmed by comparison with
the results of Ref. [9]. Both methods give very close results for the quadrupole
moment.

(Dated: February 2, 2008)

We address nonsequential double ionization induced by strong, linearly polarized laser ﬁelds of
only a few cycles, considering a physical mechanism in which the second electron is dislodged by
the inelastic collision of the ﬁrst electron with its parent ion. The problem is treated classically,
using an ensemble model, and quantum-mechanically, within the strong-ﬁeld and uniform saddle-
point approximations. In the latter case, the results are interpreted in terms of “quantum orbits”,
which can be related to the trajectories of a classical electron in an electric ﬁeld. We obtain highly
asymmetric electron momentum distributions, which strongly depend on the absolute phase, i.e., on
the phase diﬀerence between the pulse envelope and its carrier frequency. Around a particular value
of this parameter, the distributions shift from the region of positive to that of negative momenta,
or vice-versa, in a radical fashion. This behavior is investigated in detail for several driving-ﬁeld
parameters, and provides a very eﬃcient method for measuring the absolute phase. Both models
yield very similar distributions, which share the same physical explanation. There exist, however,
minor discrepancies due to the fact that, beyond the region for which electron-impact ionization
is classically allowed, the yields from the quantum mechanical computation decay exponentially,
whereas their classical counterparts vanish.

INTRODUCTION

Linearly polarized laser pulses of intensities higher
than 1014W/cm2 and only a few cycles are of vital impor-
tance to several areas of physics, being applicable to, for
instance, solid-state physics [1], high-frequency sources
[2], or isolated attosecond pulses [3]. Only the latter ap-
plication led to a breakthrough in metrology, making it
possible to trace the motion of bound electrons [4], to
probe molecular dynamics [5], and to control electron
emission [6]. In this pulse-length regime, the phase dif-
ference between the pulse envelope and its carrier fre-
quency, known as “absolute phase”, has a major inﬂu-
ence on strong-ﬁeld optical phenomena, such as high-
order harmonic generation (HHG) [7], or above-threshold
ionization (ATI) [8]. In particular, the absolute phase af-
fects, for instance, the harmonic or photoelectron yields,
the maximal energies in both spectra and the time pro-
ﬁles of ATI and HHG. This is a direct consequence of the
physical mechanisms governing such phenomena, which
occur in a subfemtosecond time scale, and for which the
time dependence of the electric ﬁeld is important.
In
fact, high-order harmonic generation is the outcome of
a three-step process in which an electron leaves an atom
by tunneling ionization at a time t′, propagates in the
continuum, and recombines with its parent ion at a later
instant t, releasing the energy gained from the ﬁeld in
form of high-frequency radiation. A similar mechanism
is also responsible for ATI, with the main diﬀerence that
the electron either rescatters elastically with its parent
ion, or reaches the detector without recolliding, originat-
ing high- or low-energy peaks in the spectra, respectively.
Such a mechanism has been extensively studied both clas-
sically [9, 10] and quantum-mechanically [11].

From the experimental point of view, controlling or

measuring the absolute phase is a very diﬃcult task [13].
This has led to the proposal and experimental realiza-
tion of schemes for its diagnosis, as, for instance, using
the asymmetry in ATI photoelectron counts reaching two
opposite detectors placed in a plane perpendicular to the
laser ﬁeld [12].

Another phenomenon whose physical explanation lies
on a laser-assisted rescattering process is nonsequential
double ionization (NSDI). In this case, an electron rec-
ollides inelastically with its parent ion, giving part of its
kinetic energy to a second electron, which is thus able
to overcome the second ionization potential and reach
the continuum. Fingerprints of such a mechanism were
only revealed very recently, in experiments in which the
momentum component parallel to the laser ﬁeld polariza-
tion could be resolved, either for the doubly charged ion
[14], or for both electrons [15]. Such features, namely a
doubly-peaked structure in the momentum distributions,
with maxima at p1k = p2k = ±2
Up, where pjk(j = 1, 2)
and Up denote the electron momentum components par-
allel to the laser ﬁeld polarization and the ponderomotive
energy [16], respectively, are, up to the present date, the
most striking example of electron-electron correlation in
the context of atoms in strong laser ﬁelds. This fact
has led not only to further experiments [17], but also to
a considerable theoretical activity on the subject, using
quantum mechanical [18, 19, 20, 21, 22], semi-classical
[23, 24, 25, 26] and classical [27, 28, 29] methods.

p

Recently, we have shown that NSDI may serve as a
powerful tool for absolute-phase measurements exploit-
ing the fact that,
inver-
sion symmetry is broken [29]. Thus, the distributions
in
are mainly concentrated in the positive or
negative momentum regions, changing from one region
to the other upon a critical phase. Such investigations

for few-cycle driving pulses,

p1k, p2k
(cid:0)

(cid:1)

have been performed classically, considering electrons re-
leased at times t′ uniformly distributed throughout the
pulse and weighted with the quasi-static tunneling rate
[30].

In this paper, we deal with this problem quantum-
mechanically, and investigate the existence of a one-
to-one correspondence with the classical model in Ref.
[29]. Similar studies have been performed for NSDI with
monochromatic driving ﬁelds, with practically identical
outcomes [25, 26]. This has shown that, at least in
the monochromatic case, which is a good approxima-
tion for the long pulses used in the experiments, intrin-
sically quantum-mechanical eﬀects such as interference
processes, or wave-packet spreading, are not important.
However, it is legitimate to ask the question of whether
this situation will persist in the few-cycle regime. Indeed,
it may well be that interference and wave-packet spread-
ing play a more important role in this latter case. Addi-
tionally, it is not clear whether the quasi-static tunneling
rate considered in the classical model remains valid for
few-cycle driving pulses. In fact, this has been recently
put into question, with the derivation of a non-adiabatic
rate [31]. Finally, it is worth checking whether asym-
metric distributions and the critical phase also occur in
a quantum-mechanical context, and, in case they do, to
understand the physics behind.

In particular, we address the above-stated questions
using a S-Matrix formalism, within the Strong-Field Ap-
proximation (SFA) [32, 33]. We consider the simplest
type of rescattering, namely electron-impact ionization,
and treat the problem in terms of the so-called “quantum
orbits” [34], which appear in the context of saddle-point
approximations. Speciﬁcally, we use a uniform approxi-
mation whose only validity requirement is that the orbits
in question occur in pairs, which is in general the case for
laser-assisted rescattering phenomena. This method has
been previously applied to NSDI in monochromatic driv-
ing ﬁelds, in order to analyze the inﬂuence of the types
of interaction and ﬁnal-state electron correlation on the
yields [25, 26]. Apart from considerably simplifying the
computations involved, as compared to other theoretical
methods [18, 19, 20], the quantum-orbit approach pro-
vides additional physical insight, in terms of a space-time
picture. In fact, the quantum orbits are closely related
to the orbits of a classical electron in an external laser
ﬁeld. Hence, in several situations, it is possible to draw
a parallel betweeen our quantum-mechanical treatment
and the previous classical considerations [29], discussing
their similarities and diﬀerences.
In the following, we
study the physical mechanisms responsible for the critical
phase within a quantum-mechanical framework, concen-
trating on the main diﬀerences from the classical picture
and from the monochromatic-driving ﬁeld case.

The paper is organized as follows: In the next sec-
II), we provide the necessary theoretical
tion (Sec.
background, presenting the transition amplitude in the
strong-ﬁeld and uniform approximations. Subsequently,
in Sec. III, we present diﬀerential electron momentum

2

distributions for various absolute phases, discussing the
main features obtained in terms of quantum orbits. The
quantum mechanical results are then compared to a clas-
sical ensemble computation which is either the same as
in [29], or slightly modiﬁed with respect to it (Sec. IV).
Finally, in Sec. V, we summarize the paper and state our
conclusions.

In this paper, we consider a contact-type interaction

which yields very good agreement with experimental data
within the context of NSDI in monochromatic driving
ﬁelds [23, 25]. In this case, the form factors Vpk, Vk0 are
constant and the SFA transition amplitude can be solved
analytically up to one quadrature. For other types of
potentials, this is only possible by evaluating multiple
integrals numerically.

For low enough frequencies and high enough laser in-
tensities, Eq. (2) can be solved to a good approximation
by the steepest descent method. Thus, we must deter-
mine k, t′ and t, such that S(t, t′, pi, k) is stationary, i.e.,
its partial derivatives with respect to these parameters
vanish. This condition yields

[k + A(t′)]2 = −2|E01|,

Eq. (7) and (8) give the energy conservation at the start
and rescattering times, respectively, while Eq. (9) con-
straints the intermediate momentum of the ﬁrst electron
so that it returns to its parent ion. For vanishing |E01|,
the classical equations of motion of both electrons in the
external ﬁeld are obtained. For non-zero |E01|, Eq. (7)
expresses tunneling ionization at t′, and has no real so-
lution. Physically, this means that this process is not
classically allowed. This results in complex variables t′, t
and k, which always occur in pairs. The real parts of such
variables are directly related to a longer and a shorter or-
bit of a classical electron in an electric ﬁeld. The longer
orbit can be associated to the so-called “slow-down colli-
sions”, which have recently been discussed in the litera-
ture [22, 24, 28]. The imaginary parts determine to which
extent electron-impact ionization is allowed or forbidden,
both within and beyond the boundaries of the classically

3

allowed energy region. In this latter domain, one of the
orbits leads to exponentially decaying contributions in
the transition amplitude (2), which cause cutoﬀs in the
distributions, while the remaining orbit starts to yield
diverging contributions, and must be discarded.

Eq. (8) can also be written in terms of the momentum
components parallel and perpendicular to the laser-ﬁeld
polarization, denoted by pjk and pj⊥(j = 1, 2), respec-
tively. In this case, for constant transverse momenta, one
obtains the equation

[pjk + A(t)]2 = [k + A(t)]2 − 2|E02| −

describing a circle in the p1k, p2k plane, whose radius de-
pends on the kinetic energy Eret(t) = [k+A(t)]2/2 of the
ﬁrst electron upon return, and on the eﬀective binding
j⊥/2. If Eret(t) ≤ | ˜E02|, this
energy | ˜E02| = |E02| +
p2
radius collapses and electron-impact ionization becomes
classically forbidden. This means that there is not only
a maximal, but also a minimal classically allowed energy,
and the resulting yields exhibit two cutoﬀs, or no cutoﬀ
at all. This is a major diﬀerence with respect to high-
order harmonic generation or above-threshold ionization,
for which only maximal classically allowed energies exist.
In the standard saddle point method, the action (3)
is expanded quadratically around the saddle points, and
the transition amplitude (2) is approximated by

where the index s runs over the relevant saddle points,
and S′′
p denotes the ﬁve-dimensional matrix of the second
derivatives of the action with respect to t, t′ and k. In
practice, we ﬁrst determine k(t, t′) as a function of the
other variables, inserting this in the action, and take

so that the computation of the determinant is simpliﬁed.
The above-stated saddle-point approximation is only
applicable for well-isolated saddle-points. This does not
hold near the boundaries of the classically allowed region,
where the pairs of saddles nearly coalesce. Furthermore,
beyond such boundaries, one of the saddles yields diverg-
ing results, and must be discarded. This leads to cusps
in the yield which are particularly problematic for non-
sequential double ionization. A detailed analysis of this
problem is given in [24].

Such artifacts can be eliminated by using a more gen-
eral, uniform approximation [37], whose only validity re-

quirement is that the saddles occur in pairs. This ap-
proximation has been successfully applied in the context
of above-threshold ionization [36] and nonsequential dou-
ble ionization [24, 26].

Within this improved approximation, in the classically
allowed region, the transition amplitude for a pair of tra-
jectories i and j is given by

Mi+j =

2π∆S/3 exp(i ¯S + iπ/4)

p
×

¯A[J1/3(∆S) + J−1/3(∆S)]
(cid:8)
+ ∆A[J2/3(∆S) − J−2/3(∆S)]

∆S = (Si − Sj)/2,
∆A = (Ai − iAj)/2,

(15)

,
(cid:9)
¯S = (Si + Sj)/2,
¯A = (iAi − Aj )/2.

The saddle-point approximation is recovered for large
values of ∆S, using the asymptotic behavior

cos(z ∓ νπ/2 − π/4)

(16)

1/2

πz (cid:19)

(cid:18)

of the Bessel functions for large z. One should note that
the uniform approximation considers the collective con-
tribution of a pair of saddle points, instead of, as in the
former case, taking them into account individually.

In the classically forbidden region, one of the saddles
must be discarded. For that purpose, a branch of the
Bessel function must be chosen in such a way that the
approximation exhibits a smooth functional behavior at
the Stokes transition [35], given by

Re Sp(ti, t′

i, ki) = Re Sp(tj, t′

j, kj).

(17)

Beyond the Stokes transition,

Mi+j =

2i∆S/π exp(i ¯S)

The saddle-point approximation is, again, recovered us-
ing the asymptotic expansion

(cid:16)

(19)

exp(−z)

Kν(z) ∼

π
2z (cid:17)
for large z. Inserting Eq. (19) into (18), it is easy to show
that only one saddle contributes to the saddle-point ap-
proximation in this energy region. Equations (15) and
(18) should be matched at the Stokes transitions, whose
energy positions roughly coincide with the boundary be-
tween the classically allowed and forbidden energy re-
gions.

In the following, we take the few-cycle pulse E(t) =

−dA(t)/dt, with

A(t) = A0 exp[−4(ωt − πn)2/(πn)2] sin[ωt + φ]ˆex, (20)

III. QUANTUM-ORBIT ANALYSIS

In Fig. 1 we present the momentum distributions com-
puted using the above-discussed method, for various ab-
solute phases, in form of contour plots in the
p1k, p2k
plane. We choose the atomic species to be neon, for
(cid:1)
(cid:0)
which electron-impact ionization is the dominant physi-
cal mechanism [38]. In general, such distributions exhibit
circular shapes, centered at particular momenta along
p1k = p2k = pk, and, in contrast to the monochromatic-
ﬁeld case, are no longer symmetric with respect to
(p1k, p2k) ↔ (−p1k, −p2k). This symmetry breaking is ex-
pected, since the relation A(t) = −A(t ± T /2), and thus
|M (t, t′, p1k, p2k)| = |M (t ± T /2, t′ ± T /2, −p1k, −p2k)|,
which was true for monochromatic driving ﬁelds, does not
hold. The circular shapes are typical for the contact-type
interaction, and are also observed in the monochromatic
case.

momenta. For instance, in the ﬁgure, initially, the par-
allel momenta of both electrons are essentially positive
(Figs. 1.(a), 1.(e) and 1.(i)). As the phase increases,
contributions from negative momenta are also present,
becoming more and more signiﬁcant, until the distribu-
tions are almost entirely shifted from the positive to the
negative momentum region (c.f. Figs. 1.(d), 1.(h) and
1.(l)). This process occurs for diﬀerent intervals of abso-
lute phases, depending on the peak intensity of the driv-
ing ﬁeld. For the speciﬁc example presented, the higher
the intensity is, the earlier the momenta start to change
sign. This phase dependence is very similar to that in

[29], obtained within a classical framework. Thereby, this
behavior was traced back to sets of electron trajectories,
whose relevance was determined by the phase space, and
by the rate with which the ﬁrst electron was ejected in
the continuum. A critical phase was related to a change
in the dominant pair of orbits, which had a huge reper-
cussion in the distributions. This phase was also shifted
towards smaller absolute values with increasing driving-
ﬁeld intensity.

Subsequently, we analyze both the asymmetry and the
critical phase in terms of pairs of quantum orbits, which
are classiﬁed as (i, j)(φ) according to increasing start
times and absolute phases. We consider only relatively
short orbits so that t − t′ <
∼ T , where T = 2π/ω denotes
the ﬁeld cycle. Longer orbits yield negligible contribu-
tions due to wave-packet spreading.

Fig. 2 shows one of such pairs for t′ near T , which
we speciﬁcally denote (1, 2)(0.5π). We consider the inter-
mediate intensity on Fig. 1, for which the phase cho-
sen yields positive parallel momenta, along the diagonal
p1k = p2k = pk. Panels (a) and (b) display Re[ωt′] and
Re[ωt] as functions of pk, which can be associated to the
times obtained by solving the classical equations of mo-
tion of two electrons colliding inelastically in a laser ﬁeld.
There exists always a longer and a shorter orbit for the
electron, which nearly coalesce near two particular mo-
menta. Such momenta correspond to Stokes transitions
[Eq. (17)], which, for high enough intensities, roughly co-
incide with the minimal and maximal classically allowed
momenta [39]. These two speciﬁc momenta delimit a
region, which is most extense for pj⊥ = 0 (j = 1, 2).
As the transverse momenta increase, the eﬀective second
ionization potential | ˜E02| also becomes larger until this
region collapses. An interesting feature is that, between
the Stokes transitions, the real parts of the rescattering
and start times are centered around a particular value
of pk, which correspond to the peak of the momentum
distributions. For few-cycle pulses, this center depends
on the pair of orbits, as well as on the absolute phase.
For monochromatic driving ﬁelds, it lies at pk = ±2
Up
[24].

p

The remaining panels depict the imaginary parts of
such times, which provide in some sense a measure for
a process being classically allowed or forbidden. Indeed,
they determine whether the transition amplitudes (2) in-
crease or decrease exponentially, or how relevant the con-
tributions from particular sets of orbits are. These imag-
inary parts noticeably increase at and beyond the Stokes
transitions, and remain practically constant in the mo-
mentum region inbetween. This suggests that, in this
region, electron-impact ionization is either classically al-
lowed, or at least much more probable to occur. Ad-
ditionaly, whereas Im[ωt] almost vanishes in this region,
Im[ωt′] has a nearly constant and nonvanishing value (c.f.
panels (c)). This is due to the fact that tunneling per se
is classically forbidden. Indeed, the larger this value is,
the smaller is the probability that this process takes place
at all.

FIG. 4: The same as in the previous ﬁgures for the orbits 5
and 6.

∼ t′ <
Two additional pairs of orbits, for which 1.5T <
∼
2T, are displayed in Figs. 3 and 4. At these times, the
pulse (20) is closer to its peak intensity. In such ﬁgures,
there exist extense regions between the Stokes transi-
tions, in which Re[ωt′] and Re[ωt] practically coincide
with the start and return times obtained within a clas-
sical framework, and in which |Im[ωt]| are vanishingly
small. Such features are a clear evidence that, in this
case, electron-impact ionization is classically allowed.

Another noteworthy feature is that, in the classically
allowed region, |Im[ωt′]| has much smaller values than
those in Fig. 2. Physically, this means that the ﬁrst
electron left with a larger tunneling probability at t′, in
comparison to the orbits (1.2)(0.5π). Furthermore, the
fact that this region is extense shows that that the ki-
netic energy of the ﬁrst electron upon return is larger for
(3, 4)(0.5π) and (5, 6)(0.5π) than for (1.2)(0.5π). For that
reason, the contributions from (3, 4)(0.5π) and (5, 6)(0.5π)
to the total yield should be more relevant than those from
(1.2)(0.5π).

This is conﬁrmed by Fig. 5, which depicts the yields
computed from each pair of the above-discussed orbits,
along the diagonal p1k = p2k = pk.
In Fig. 5(a), the
contributions from (5, 6)(0.5π) are at least two orders of
magnitude larger than those from the remaining pairs,
so that the distributions will be concentrated in the ﬁrst
quadrant of the
plane. Hence, for practical
purposes, the remaining contributions can be neglected.
They are, however, very useful for the physical under-
standing of the problem.

The second most prominent contributions come from
(3, 4)(0.5π). This is expected, since, for these orbits, there
is a relatively large probablity that the ﬁrst electron tun-

electron-impact ionization is allowed.

FIG. 5:
Individual contributions of the four most relevant
pairs of orbits to the NSDI yield, for p1k = p2k = pk, for pon-
deromotive energy Up = 1.2 a.u and absolute phases φ = 0.5π,
φ = 0.8π and φ = 1.1π (panels (a), (b) and (c), respectively).
The remaining parameters are the same as in the previous
ﬁgures. The curves have been normalized to the maximum
of the most relevant contributions. Speciﬁcally, in panels (b)
and (c), the contributions from (1, 2) are smaller than the
range of orders of magnitude displayed.

ingly, the contributions from all pairs of orbits discussed
above, including (7, 8)(0.5π), are several orders of magni-
tude larger than those from the pair (1, 2)(0.5π). This is
due to the fact that, for (7, 8)(0.5π) the tunneling prob-
ability for the ﬁrst electron is considerably larger than
for (1, 2)(0.5π). From the technical viewpoint, it is worth
mentioning that, for (7, 8)(0.5π), the yield has been com-
puted by using Eq. (11), and taking the orbit for which
this expression is exponentially decaying.

For other absolute phases, there may be other sets of
orbits whose contributions may compete with or even
overwhelm those from (5, 6). This is in fact the case in
Figs. 5(b), and 5(c), for φ = 0.8π and φ = 1.1π, respec-
tively. Such phases, as well as the remaining parameters,
are the same as in Figs. 1(d) and 1(f), corresponding to
the beginning and to the end of a shift in the momentum
distributions.

In Fig. 5(b), one clearly sees that the second most rele-
vant pair of orbits is no longer (3, 4)(0.8π), but (7, 8)(0.8π).
The contributions from such orbits now are only one or-
der of magnitude smaller than those from (5, 6)(0.8π).
Consequently, there are also small, but not negligible
contributions in negative momentum regions. This is in
agreement with Fig. 1(d), for which there is a small spot
in the third quadrant of the (p1k, p2k) plane, in addition
to the dominant contributions in the ﬁrst quadrant. For

FIG. 6: Real (panel (a)) and imaginary (panel (b)) parts
of the start times for the orbits (3,4), (5,6) and (7,8) along
p1k = p2k and for vanishing transverse momenta, indicated
by dotted, dashed and solid lines, respectively. We consider
neon subject to a four-cycle (n = 4) pulse of intensity I =
5.5 × 1014W/cm
, various absolute phases and frequency ω =
0.057 a.u. Speciﬁcally for φ = 0.5π, electron-impact ionization
is classically forbidden for the orbits (7, 8).

larger phases, as for instance φ = 1.1π (Fig. 5(c)), the
contributions from (7, 8) become even more relevant than
those from (5, 6). Hence, the distributions are shifted
from the ﬁrst to the third quadrant, in accordance to
Fig. 1(h).

In Fig. 6, we systematically analyze the dependence of
the real and imaginary parts of the times t′ on the abso-
lute phase, for the three most relevant sets of orbits. As
an overall feature, for the pair (3, 4), |Im[ωt′]| is larger
than for the remaining two pairs. Physically, this means
that tunneling is less probable in this case. In general,
this makes the contributions from this pair to the yield
less relevant than those from the other two sets. An ex-
ception, however, occurs for φ = 0.5π, due to the fact
that, in this case, electron-impact ionization is forbidden
for (7, 8). This leads to exponentially decaying contribu-
tions for this pair, which are overwhelmed by those from
(3, 4). Still, even in this particular case, these latter are
two order of magnitude smaller than the yield from the
orbits (5, 6) (c.f. Fig. 5(a)).

For high driving-ﬁeld intensities, as those in the lower
panels in Fig. 1, there may exist minor, though not neg-
ligible, contributions from (3, 4).
In general, however,
these contributions are vanishingly small. An interesting
feature is that, with increasing absolute phases, this set of
orbits gradually loses relevance, since |Im[ωt′]| increases.
This can be explicitly seen in Fig. 5, where the yield from

FIG. 7: Time-dependent electric ﬁeld, for various absolute
phases. The peak-ﬁeld times are marked with arrows and the
corresponding pairs of orbits are indicated by the numbers in
the ﬁgure. The remaining parameters are the same as in the
previous ﬁgure.

(3, 4) decreases in at least three orders of magnitude as
φ increases.

The other two pairs of orbits, (5, 6) and (7, 8) are, in
fact, far more important to the yield. Thereby, three dis-
tinct behaviors can be identiﬁed. Below φ = 0.8π, the
distributions are mainly determined by the orbits (5, 6),
whose contributions lie in the region of pk > 0. Around
this phase, the pair (7, 8)(0.8π) comes into play. Indeed,
although this pair does not delimit a large classically al-
lowed region, the imaginary parts of the corresponding
start times are comparable to or smaller than those of
(5, 6). Thus, the contributions from both pairs start to
compete, and the distributions spread over both positive
and negative momentum regions. As the phase increases,
|Im[ωt′]| gradually decreases for this latter set, until the
negative parallel momenta are favored. This explains the
features in Fig. 1. One may refer to φ = 0.8π as a critical
phase φc, since it marks a change in the sets of dominant
orbits.

The pulse proﬁle (Fig. 7), together with the real parts
of the tunneling times, allows an intuitive interpretation
of the above statements. Below φc = 0.8π, the peak
value of the pulse is near Re[ωt′] for the orbits (5, 6),
whose contributions then dominate. Thus, the distribu-
tions essentially concentrate in the positive momentum
region. Around this phase, this picture starts to change,
and there are two sets of orbits, namely (5, 6) and (7, 8),
for which the instantaneous electric ﬁelds at the tunnel-
ing times are comparable. This situation persists within
a phase interval until, ﬁnally, the absolute maximum of
the ﬁeld corresponds to the latter set of orbits, so that the
momenta are mainly negative. An interesting situation
for which, in principle, there exists
occurs for φ = 0.5π,
two sets of times near which the electric ﬁeld exhibits
comparable maxima, corresponding to (3, 4) and (7, 8).
For low intensities, rescattering is not allowed for the or-

bits (7, 8), and the contributions to the yield are absent.
For high intensities, however, electron-impact ionization
is already allowed in this case, so that the critical phase
is shifted towards smaller values.

In Fig. 8, we explicitly show how electron-impact ion-
ization becomes classically allowed or or forbidden upon
a change in the driving-ﬁeld intensity, for φc = 0.8π. In
fact, as the intensity is decreased, this process ceases to
be allowed for the orbits (7, 8), whose contributions lie
near
the peak of the pulse (c.f. Fig. 7). As a direct
consequence, the critical phase is shifted towards larger
absolute values as the intensity decreases, as shown in
Fig. 1.

IV. COMPARISON WITH CLASSICAL MODELS

In this section, we will recall and apply the classical
model used in [29], performing a direct comparison with
the results of the S-Matrix computation. We consider
an electron ensemble subject to the few-cycle pulse (20),
which are released from the origin of the coordinate sys-
tem with initial vanishing drift velocities, i.e.,

p + A(t′) = 0.

(22)

The varying parameters are the tunneling times t′, uni-
formly distributed throughout the pulse, and the quasi-

R(t′) ∼ exp

/|E(t′)|,

(23)

with which the electron counts are weighted. Some of
these electrons subsequently return to the origin and
free a second electron ensemble at later times t through
electron-impact ionization. Their return and rescattering
conditions are given by Eqs. (9) and (8), respectively.
The yields are then given by

where Eret(t) is the kinetic energy of the electron upon
return and the argument in the δ function gives the en-
ergy conservation at t. This model is discussed in more
detail in [26].

Fig. 9 presents the outcome of the classical compu-
Inter-
tation, for the same parameters as in Fig. 1.
estingly, both ﬁgures are very similar.
Indeed, there
exist only minor diﬀerences near the boundaries of the
classically allowed region, which occur for high inten-
sities, as displayed in the lower panels of Figs. 1 and
9. Such diﬀerences are due to the fact that the yield
from the quantum-mechanical computation is exponen-
tially decaying in the region for which electron-impact
ionization is classically forbidden, whereas the distribu-
tion (24) immediately vanishes. Such discrepancies were
also present in the monochromatic case.

Further discrepancies occur for speciﬁc phases, in pan-
els (c) and (e) of both ﬁgures, and show that the sign
reversal starts to take place for slightly smaller abso-
lute phases in the quantum-mechanical case. This eﬀect
can be understood if one keeps in mind that the criti-
cal phase indicates a change in the dominant set of tra-
jectories, and that pre-requisites for this dominance are
a large tunneling probability for the ﬁrst electron and
electron-impact ionization being classically allowed. In
the particular example provided in the panels (c) and (e)
of Figs. 1 and 9, this process has just become allowed
for the orbits (7, 8), within a small momentum region. In
the quantum-mechanical case (Fig. 1), there exist con-
tributions to the yield from near the boundary of such a
region, even if rescattering is forbidden, whereas in the
classical model (Fig. 9) such contributions vanish. Ob-
viously, such discrepancies are absent in the symmetric
momentum distributions obtained in the monochromatic
case.

For monochromatic driving ﬁelds, a very good agree-
ment has also been reported in previous publications
[25, 26]. It is not obvious, however, that this would re-
main true in the few-cycle regime. In fact, apart from
yielding distributions which immediately vanish at the
boundaries of the classically allowed region, the classical
model does not take into account several eﬀects which

are present in the quantum-mechanical computation. Ex-
amples of such eﬀects are the quantum interference be-
tween diﬀerent possible paths for the returning electron,
or the spread of the electron wave packet. Furthermore,
the classical model considers an additional approxima-
tion with respect to the S-Matrix computation, namely
Eq. (23), which is a quasi-static, cycle-averaged tunnel-
ing rate. This rate is a key ingredient in the distributions
given by Eq. (24), and vital for the phase-dependence
observed in Fig. 9 (c.f. Fig. 10 and discussions in [29]).
However, its validity may be limited or even questionable
in the few-cycle regime. Indeed, recently, a non-adiabatic
rate that should be more accurate in this case has been
derived [31]. In general, the non-adiabatic rate tends to
broaden the time range for which the relevance of sets
of orbits persists. We veriﬁed, however, that this rate
does not modify the yields for the parameter range in
question. Discrepancies between the quasi-static and the
non-adiabatic rate occur only when the Keldysh param-
eter γ =
|E01|/(2Up) is much larger than unity. In this
case, the driving-ﬁeld intensity would be far too low for
the rescattering process discussed in this paper to be al-
lowed, and thus for the classical model to be applicable.
For measurements of NSDI yields below the threshold
see, e.g., Ref. [40].

The subsequent picture (Fig. 10) is the classical coun-
terpart of Fig. 6, providing an interpretation of Fig.
9 in terms of the interplay between the ionization rate
(23) and the phase space. Thereby, as in the quantum-
mechanical case, we consider parallel momenta along the
diagonal p1k = p2k = pk and vanishing transverse mo-
menta. The main contributions to the yield come from
pairs of trajectories for which the tunneling probability
is large, and for which electron-impact ionization is clas-
sically allowed. In the ﬁgure, according to such criteria,
it is possible to identify two sets of relevant orbits, cor-
responding to electrons ejected at 9 <
∼ 12, with
positive parallel momenta, and to electrons released at

∼ ωt′ <

12 <

∼ ωt′ <
∼ 15, with negative parallel momenta.
According to the absolute phase, similarly to the
quantum-mechanical case, there exist three distinct types
of behavior. For φ < 0.8π, apart from the fact that
the classically allowed region is almost vanishing for the
orbits (7, 8), the quasi-static rate (23) is considerably
larger for the former set of electrons, so that the distribu-
tions are concentrated in the positive momentum regions.
Around φ = 0.8π, such tunneling rates are comparable
for both sets of orbits, resulting in nonvanishing yields for
positive and negative parallel momenta. Finally, as the
phase increases, tunneling is more prominent for the lat-
ter set of orbits, and the distributions gradually change
towards negative momenta. As in the previous section,
the critical phase marks a change in the dominant orbits.
This is in agreement with Fig. 6 and with the results in
[29].

The ratios between the individual contributions of such
pairs of orbits, as well as the momenta for which their
maxima occur, displayed in Fig. 11, are also in very
good agreement with its quantum-mechanical counter-
part (Fig. 5). However, the distributions computed with
the classical model are narrower than those obtained us-
ing the quantum-mechanical computation. This is once
more related to the fact that, in a classical framework,
the contributions from the forbidden momentum region
can not be taken into account.

Another interesting feature, which is displayed in Fig.
12, is the existence of other critical phases. For instance,
around φ = 0.1π, there is a transition in the momentum
distributions from the third to the ﬁrst quadrant in the
(p1k, p2k) plane, i.e., exactly in the opposite direction as
the transition in Figs. 1 and 9. Furthermore, the upper
and lower panels in Fig. 12 look exactly the same, if the
ﬁrst and the third quadrant are interchanged. This shows
that there is a symmetry in the momentum distributions,
which is due to the fact that A(t, φ) = −A(t, φ ± π), so

The studies performed in this paper clearly show that
nonsequential double ionization with few-cycle pulses is
a powerful tool for absolute-phase measurements. More
speciﬁcally, the yields, as functions of the electron mo-
mentum components (p1k, p2k) parallel to the laser-ﬁeld
polarization, are mainly concentrated either in the posi-
tive or negative momentum region, depending on the ab-
solute phase in question. Around a critical phase, such
distributions start to shift from one momentum region
to the other, until, as the phase increases, complete sign
reversal in the momenta occurs. Such features, obtained
considering (e−, 2e−) electron-impact ionization within
a quantum-mechanical S-Matrix framework, are inter-
preted in terms of the so-called quantum orbits, which
can be directly associated to the trajectories of classical
electrons. Both the asymmetry and the critical phase re-
sult from the interplay between phase-space eﬀects, and
the probability that the ﬁrst electron leaves its parent ion
through tunneling ionization. The former and the latter,
respectively, determine whether electron-impact ioniza-
tion is classically allowed or forbidden, or the relevance
of a set of orbits to the yield.

The huge eﬀects observed, namely the yields vanishing
or appearing over extense and well-separated regions in
the (p1k, p2k) plane, are a due to a particular character-
istic of the rescattering process in question, for which, in
addition to a maximal, there is also a minimal classically
allowed energy. In other words, electron-impact ioniza-
tion is allowed only within conﬁned phase-space regions,
deﬁned by the radius in Eq. (10). By varying the driving-
ﬁeld intensity and the absolute phase adequately, this ra-
dius can be forced to vanish, so that a whole phase-space
region would become classically forbidden. Furthermore,
a particular region can be made irrelevant due to a small
tunneling probability for the ﬁrst electron. This is a
major advantage over other phenomena occurring in the
context of strong-laser ﬁeld matter interaction, such as
above-threshold ionization and high-order harmonic gen-
eration. For both phenomena, there are only maximal
classically allowed energies, so that these eﬀects do not
occur.

Apart from providing support for previous classical
computations [29], the present results allow one to es-
tablish a one-to-one correspondence between the classical
and the quantum-mechanical approaches.

Tunneling, for instance, is incorporated in the classical
model using the quasi-static rate (23) which weights the
electron counts. In the S-Matrix computation, this pro-
cess is directly related to the imaginary parts of the start
times t′. Both the quasi-static rate and Im[t′] are some-
how a measure of the relevance of a set of orbits. Indeed,
dominant contributions always come from pairs of orbits
for which Eq.(23) is larger, or Im[t′] are smaller than

those from the remaining pairs. Depending on the abso-
lute phase, this may occur for a single set of orbits, whose
contributions lie either in the negative or in the positive
momentum regions, or there may be sets of orbits whose
contributions compete. A critical phase characterizes a
change in the dominant set of orbits.

Furthermore, the phase-space eﬀects which occur if
electron-impact ionization becomes classically forbidden,
i.e., if the radius in Eq.
(10) collapses, are present in
both frameworks in very similar, though not entirely
identical, ways. In the classical computation, this would
lead to vanishing yields, since the condition in the ar-
gument of the δ function in Eq. (24) would never be
fulﬁlled. In the quantum-mechanical model, there would
be exponentially decaying contributions throughout. If
this radius does not collapse, the process will be allowed
within a conﬁned phase-space region.
In the classical
case, the start and return times coalesce at the bound-
aries of this region, whereas, quantum-mechanically, this
does not completely happen.

The above-stated eﬀects explain the minor discrep-
ancies between Figs.
In particular, two
1 and 9.
types of discrepancies have been observed. First, for
high driving-ﬁeld intensities, the distributions obtained
with the quantum-mechanical computation are slightly
broader than those from the classical model. Second,
in the quantum-mechanical framework, the distributions
start to shift at a slightly smaller phase, as compared to

11

the outcome of the classical simulation. The former dif-
ferences were also present in NSDI with monochromatic
driving ﬁelds, whereas the latter discrepancies are speciﬁc
to asymmetric momentum distributions, which occur, for
instance, in the context of few-cycle driving pulses.

The agreement between both the quantum-mechanical
and the classical computations go beyond the physical
explanations for the asymmetry and the critical phase.
Indeed, the momentum distributions computed with the
one or the other method, as well as the predicted criti-
cal phase and the interval in which the momenta change
sign, are very similar, apart from minor diﬀerences near
the classical boundaries. This is a concrete evidence that
the eﬀects reported in this paper are not rooted on a par-
ticular model or framework, being, on the contrary, of a
deeper physical nature. In fact, recently, a similar asym-
metry has been observed in ongoing NSDI experiments
with few-cycle driving pulses [41].

[38] For neon, there is excellent agreement between computa-
tions considering electron-impact ionization and the ex-
perimental results, in the long pulse regime. For other
species, such as argon, other physical mechanisms, as
for instance tunneling-excitation, may also be important.

if the ﬁrst ionization
potential vanishes, i.e., in the classical limit, electron-
impact ionization is only classically allowed for slightly
larger intensities, corresponding to Up = 1.218 a.u.,
whereas, in the S-Matrix framework, there exist Stokes
transitions already for Up = 1.2 a.u. This is related to the
fact that, for (1, 2), the driving-ﬁeld intensity at the tun-
neling time t′ is low enough for the quantum-classical cor-
respondence to become less reliable. This behavior shows
that the existence of Stokes transitions is a necessary,
but not suﬃcient condition for the existence of an energy
region for which electron-impact ionization is classically

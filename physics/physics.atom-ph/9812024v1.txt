Abstract

Negative ion detachment in bichromatic laser ﬁeld is considered within

the adiabatic theory. The latter represents a recent modiﬁcation of the fa-

mous Keldysh model for multiphoton ionization [L. V. Keldysh, Zh. Eksp.

Teor. Fiz. 47, 1945 (1964) [Sov. Phys.-JETP 20, 1307 (1965)]] which makes

it quantitatively reliable. We calculate angular diﬀerential detachment rates,

partial rates for particular ATD (Above Threshold Detachment) channels and

total detachment rates for H− ion in a bichromatic ﬁeld with 1 : 3 frequency

ratio and various phase diﬀerences. Reliability of the present, extremely sim-

ple approach is testiﬁed by comparison with much more elaborate earlier

calculations.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interest to the photoionization of atoms in a bichromatic laser ﬁeld both in theory (see,

for instance, Ref. [1]– [13]) and in experiment [1] [14]– [16] seems to stem ﬁrst of all from

the eﬀect of the phase control, i.e. dependence of the observables on the diﬀerence of ﬁeld

phases ϕ.

The calculations have been carried out previously for ionization of the hydrogen atom

in two laser ﬁelds with a frequency ratio 1 : 2 [4], 1 : 3 [5] and 2 : 3 [7]. Potvliege and Smith

[6] presented results for various frequency ratios and initial states. Diﬀerent schemes have

been employed, but all of them imply numerically intensive work.

For the multiphoton electron detachment from negative ions some analytical treatment

exists [8] [9] which aims to investigate qualitative features of the process, mostly in the

case when one or both ﬁelds are weak. The presence of large number of parameters in the

problem sometimes makes results of analytical studies not directly transparent. Quantitative

reliability of these approaches has never been assessed. This situation looks particularly

unsatisfactory since the multiphoton electron detachment from negative ions presents unique

situation when quantitative results can be obtained by analytical method in a broad range

of parameters characteristic to the problem.

Indeed, it has been demonstrated recently

by Gribakin and Kuchiev [17] [18] that proper application of the well-known Keldysh [19]

model to multiphoton detachment [20] provides an extremely simple scheme that gives very

reliable results for the total rates as well as for ATD (Above Threshold Detachment) spectrum

and ATD angular distributions. This adiabatic approximation ensures an accuracy which is

comparable with that of the most elaborate numerical developments and works unexpectedly

well even outside its formal applicability range, i.e. even for small number n of photons

absorbed. The evidences of good performance of the Keldysh model for the total rates were

presented also in the earlier paper [25].

Recently the adiabatic approach was extended by the present authors [26] to the case

of bichromatic ﬁeld. The practical applications were carried out for the case of frequency

2

ratio 1 : 2 when in addition to the phase eﬀects another unusual phenomenon exists, namely

the polar asymmetry of the angular distribution of photoelectrons. Unfortunately no other

quantitative data for photodetachment in this case is available which makes comparison

impossible.

The main objective of the present study is to assess quantitatively an accuracy of the adi-

abatic scheme by comparison with the previous calculations carried out by Telnov et al [11]

in case of 1 : 3 frequency ratio. For this ratio the polar asymmetry is absent, but the phase

eﬀects persist. The calculations by Telnov et al [11] are based on suﬃciently sophisticated

numerical scheme providing a useful benchmark. We present (Sec. II) complete comparison

of the results by considering angular diﬀerential detachment rates, heights of ATD peaks

and total detachment rates. It should be emphasized that the angular diﬀerential rates are

most sensitive to the formulation of the model representing an ultimate test for the theory,

as discussed in Sec.III. We draw also some general conclusion on the relation between the

adiabatic approach and the numerical calculations within the one-electron approximation.

II. RESULTS

The adiabatic theory of two-color detachment was outlined in our previous paper [26]

where the reader can ﬁnd all the details of calculation. Here we only write down the expres-

sion for the electric ﬁeld strength in the bichromatic laser ﬁeld with 1 : 3 frequency ratio in

order to specify the deﬁnition of the ﬁeld phase diﬀerence ϕ

~F (t) = ~F1 cos ωt + ~F2 cos(3ωt + ϕ) .

(1)

~F1, ~F2 are the amplitude vectors for the fundamental frequency ω and its third harmonics

respectively. Below we consider, just as in Ref. [11], the case when both fundamental ﬁeld and

its third harmonics are linear polarized with ~F1 k ~F2. Then the diﬀerential photoionization

rate depends only on the single angle θ between the photoelectron translational momentum

~p and the vectors ~F1 k ~F2. Atomic units are used throughout the paper unless stated

otherwise.

3

Our calculations for H− detachment are carried out for the parameters of H− as before

[26] (κ = 0.2354, A = 0.75). We choose two sets of ﬁeld intensities I1 and I2 for the

fundamental frequency ω = 0.0043 (that of CO2 laser) and its third harmonics, same as

in the paper by Telnov et al

[11], namely (i) I1 = 1010W/cm2, I2 = 109W/cm2 and (ii)

I1 = 1010W/cm2, I2 = 108W/cm2.

In case of the frequencies ratio 1 : 3 considered here the ﬁeld (1) does not possess polar

asymmetry (i.e. asymmetry under inversion of the z axis directed along ~F1 k ~F2). Therefore

the diﬀerential detachment rate does not change under the transformation θ ⇒ π − θ. This

allows us to show plots only for 1

2π ≥ θ ≥ 0 domain.

Figs. 1-6 show the diﬀerential detachment rate as a function of the angle θ for three

lowest (open) ATD channels and for two sets of ﬁeld intensities. The system Hamiltonian is

a 2π-periodic function of the phase parameter ϕ. We show our results for ϕ = 0, ϕ = ± 1

2 and

ϕ = π. The transformation ϕ ⇒ π − ϕ leaves the Hamiltonian invariant only if t is replaced

by −t. As stressed in Refs. [2], the problem is invariant under the time inversion operation

provided the ﬁnal-state electron interaction with the atomic core is neglected. This is the

case in the present model. Therefore our diﬀerential ionization rates are the same for ϕ and

−ϕ. The calculations by Telnov et al [11] do take into account the ﬁnal state electron-core

interaction. Therefore they show some diﬀerence between the angular diﬀerential rates for ϕ

and −ϕ. However, it proves to be quite small for low ATD channels as seen from the plots.

The importance of the interaction between the emitted electron and the core has been

ﬁrst pointed out by one of the present authors [27]. In this paper several phenomena has been

predicted for which this interaction plays crucial role. The related mechanism was named

“atomic antenna”. In the recent literature the ﬁnal state interaction is usually referred to

as rescattering. In our problem the rescattering eﬀects are enhanced for high ATD channels

as discussed below.

The results of our extremely simple theory are compared in Figs. 1-6 with the previous

numerical calculations by Telnov et al [11] which are rather involving. Being carried out in

the one-electron approximation, they employ an accurate model for the eﬀective one-electron

4

potential in H− [28], complex-scaling generalized pseudospectral technique [29] to discretize

and facilitate the solution of the time-independent non-Hermitian Floquet Hamiltonian for

complex quasienergies and eigenfunctions, and calculation of the electron energy and angular

distributions by the reverse complex-scaling method [30]. As a lucid illustration of simplicity

of the present approach it is worthwhile to stress that it does not rely on any particular form

of an eﬀective one-electron potential albeit employs only two parameters κ and A governing

the asymptotic behavior of the initial bound state wave function.

From Figs. 1-6 one can see that the adiabatic approximation ensures good quantitative

agreement with calculations by Telnov et al [11]. In particular, positions of maxima and

minima in the angular photoelectron distribution are well reproduced. This demonstrates

that the adiabatic approach correctly describes the nature of the structure as due to inter-

ference between the electron waves emitted at various (complex-valued) moments of time.

Indeed, within the adiabatic theory [26] the ionization amplitude is expressed as a sum of a

number of interfering contributions. Mathematically they come from diﬀerent saddle points

in the approximate evaluation of the integral over time that emerges in the Keldysh [19]

model. Physically they correspond to the coherent emission of photoelectron at diﬀerent

moments of time. For our particular frequency ratio 1 : 3 the sum contains 6 interfering

contributions as compared with 4 term for 1 : 2 frequency ratio [26] and 2 terms for one-

color detachment [17] [18]. Generally this suggests that in the former case more complicated

angular patterns emerge. Probably one can ﬁnd here a correlation with an alternative in-

terpretation in the multiphoton absorption framework. The latter argues [7] [11] that the

angular distribution structure in 1 : 3 case is more complicated than for 1 : 2 ratio since all

the pathways leading to a continuum state with the same energy interfere in the 1 : 3 case

whereas a considerable pattern of non-interfering pathways exists for the the 1 : 2 case due

to parity or energy restrictions (each pathway is characterized by the number of photons of

diﬀerent colors absorbed successively).

The partial detachment rate for each ATD channel are shown in tables I and II for two sets

of ﬁeld intensities. The agreement is good for low ATD channels; note that the rescattering

5

eﬀects which generate dependence on the sign of ϕ are manifested in the partial rates even

less than in the angular distributions shown in Figs. 1-6. For higher ATD channels with low

rates the diﬀerence between the present results and those of Telnov et al [11] becomes more

pronounced. This behavior could be interpreted as increasing importance of rescattering for

high ATD peaks. The manifestations of this eﬀect were observed recently in experiment [31]

and are currently vividly discussed in the literature [27] [31] [32] [33].

III. CONCLUSION

As a summary, the adiabatic approach provides quantitatively reliable tool for investi-

gating two-color photodetachment of negative ions. In particular, the interference structure

in the photoelectron angular distributions as well as the phase eﬀects are correctly described.

Since generally the interference phenomena are known to be most sensitive to the details

of theoretical description, one can conclude that the present theory had successfully passed

the stringent test.

The Keldysh scheme [19] is known to be gauge-noninvariant. Importantly, the calcula-

tions within the adiabatic approach [17] [18] [26] employ the dipole-length gauge for the laser

ﬁeld thus stressing contribution of the long-range asymptote of the initial bound state wave

function. The use of the length gauge together with the adiabatic approach (i.e. integration

over time by the saddle point method, see Refs. [17] [18] [26] and discussion in Sec.II) ren-

der self-consistent character to the theoretical scheme. Indeed, the exact evaluation of the

integrals does not add to the accuracy of the result as compared with the use of the saddle

point method. This is because in the former case the integral absorbs the contributions from

the wave function outside its asymptotic domain, where in fact it is known with much lower

accuracy (being, in particular, inﬂuenced by the eﬀects beyond the single active electron

approximation).

The method is straightforwardly applicable to the negative ions with the outer electron

having non-zero orbital momentum, such as halogen ions, which could be easier accessible

6

for the experimental studies (for the one-color detachment such applications could be found

in Ref. [17]). Technically the calculations within the adiabatic approach are extremely

simple reducing to ﬁnding the roots of polynomial and substituting them into an analytical

expression [26] (the related Mathematica [34] program takes only few lines). It should be

recognized that the single active electron approximation itself introduces some intrinsic error.

It seems that often this error could be comparable with the diﬀerence between the result of

numerical one-electron calculations and these of the adiabatic approximation. Uncertainty

of the one-electron approach in principle could be removed within the two-electron approach

which however consumes much more eﬀorts. The two-electron calculations which has been

carried out recently show that the one-electron approximation is generally suﬃcient unless

one is particularly interested in the subtle resonance eﬀects [25] [35] [36] (the calculations

beyond one-electron approximation are currently possible only for small number of absorbed

photons). For high ATD channels with low intensities the adiabatic approximation becomes

less reliable due to increasing role of rescattering eﬀects neglected in the present form of

the approximation. It seems however that relatively simple modiﬁcations of the adiabatic

approximation could be carried to include rescattering eﬀects.

Reliability of the results obtained above for the simple one-electron problem with rescat-

tering neglected is highly important in perspective, since they are to be included as a con-

stituent part in the treatment of much more sophisticated one-electron and many-electron

problems governed by the antenna mechanism [27] [37] [38].

FIG. 1. Detachment of H− ion in bichromatic ﬁeld with the frequencies ω = 0.0043 and 3ω

and intensities I1 = 1010W/cm2 and I2 = 109W/cm2 respectively. Diﬀerential detachment rate

(in units 10−8a.u.) as a function of the electron emission angle θ is shown for the ﬁrst ATD peak

(corresponding to absorption of n = 8 photons of frequency ω) and various values of the ﬁeld phase

diﬀerence ϕ as indicated in the plots. Open symbols show results of calculations by Telnov et al

[11] (in the ϕ = ± 1

2 π plot the open circles show the results for ϕ = 1

2 π and open triangles these for
2 π). Solid curves show results of the present adiabatic theory (which coincide for ϕ = 1

ϕ = − 1

and ϕ = − 1

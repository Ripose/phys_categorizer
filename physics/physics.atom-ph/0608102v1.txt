We deduce the quantization of the atomic orbit for the hydrogen’s atom model proposed by Bohr
without using his hypothesis of angular momentum quantization. We show that his hypothesis can
be deduced from and is a consequence of the Planck’s energy quantization.

INTRODUCTION

The existence of an atomic nucleus was conﬁrmed in 1911 by E. Rutherford in his classic scattering experiment [1].
Before that time, it was believed that an atom was something like a positively charged dough and negatively charged
raisins scattered here and there within the dough, or an ice-cream with chocolate chip ﬂakes in it, where the ice-cream
would be the positive charge (protons) and the chocolate chip ﬂakes the negative charge (electrons); an atomic model
proposed by J.J.Thomson in 1904. However, this atomic model had many problems. And it became untenable as E.
Rutherford showed the inconsistencies of such a model in face of his experiments of alpha particle (ionized helium)
scattering by thin sheets of gold as targets. The main objection to that model being that scattering experiments
indicated a far more ”dilute” type of matter constituints and ”empty” space within objects.

Then, Rutherford himself proposed the orbital model for the atom, in which there was a central nucleus populated
by positively charged particles – protons – and negatively charge particles – electrons – moving around the nucleus
in orbital trajectories, similar to the solar system with the sun at the center and planets orbiting it, described by the
mechanics of celestial bodies acted on under central forces among them. Later on, the concept of neutral particles –
neutrons – within the nucleus came to be added into the model.

The planetary model, however, was not free of problems. The main objection was that in such a model, electrons
moving around the nucleus would radiate energy and therefore, classically, such an atom would collapse into itself after
electrons radiated all their energy. Therefore, the model proposed by Rutherford had to be modiﬁed, and here comes
the contribution of N. Bohr, which proposed the hypothesis for quantization of electron orbits making it possible to
better understand the properties of atoms and of the stuﬀ with which they are made of.

A comment may be in order here: At that time, the atomic nucleus was understood as a “storage” of mass and
positive charge of the atom. There was no need to know neither a hint as to what was the internal structure of
the nucleus.[2]. These concepts came into play afterwards, as experiments got more sophisticated and more deeply
concerned as to the internal structure of atoms.

II. THOMSON’S MODEL

In the model proposed by J.J. Thomson [3] in 1904, the atom was considered like a ﬂuid with continuous spherical
distribution of positive charges where electrons with negative charges were embedded, in a number suﬃcient to
neutralize the positive charges. This model had an implicit underlying assumption: that of the existence of stable
conﬁgurations for the electrons around which they would oscilate. However, according to the classical electromagnetic
theory, there can be no stable conﬁguration in a system of charged particles if the only interaction among them is
of the electromagnetic character. Moreover, since any electrically charged particle in an accelerated movement emits
electromagnetic radiation, his model had an additional hypothesis that the normal modes for the oscillating electrons
would have the same frequencies as those observed associated with the lines of the atomic spectrum. However, there
was not found any conﬁguration for the electrons for any atom whose normal modes had any one of the expected
frequencies. Therefore, Thomson’s model for the atom was abandoned because there was no agreement between its
assumptions/predictions and the experimental results obtained by H. Geiger and E. Marsden [4].

III. THE PLANETARY ATOMIC MODEL

The discoveries that ocurred by the end of XIX century led the physicist Ernest Rutherford to do scattering experi-
ments that culminated in a proposal for the planetary model for atoms.

According to this model, all positive charge of a given atom, with approximately 99% of its mass, would be
concentrated in the atomic nucleus. Electrons would be moving around the nucleus in circular orbits and these would
be the carriers of the negative charges. Knowing that the charge of an electron and the charge of a proton are the
same in modulus, and that the nucleus has Z protons, we can deﬁne the charge of the nucleus as Ze−.

Experimentally we observe that in an atom the distance r between the electron orbit and the nucleus is of the order

In this section, we build the planetary model for the atom and analyse its predictions compared to experimental

data.

Using Coulomb’s law

and the centripetal force acting on the electron in its circular orbit

results in

where we have used the shorthand notation |e−| = e.

From (4) we can estimate the radius for the electron orbit,

r =

4πε0mev2 Z ,

which means that the radius depends on the total number of protons in the nucleus, Z, and also on the electron’s
velocity. Here we can make some deﬁnite estimates and see whether our estimates are reasonable, i.e., agrees or
does not violate experimental data. According to the special theory of relativity, no greater velocity can any particle
possess than the speed of light. More precisely, for particles with mass like electrons, we know that their velocity is
limited by v < c where c is the speed of light in vacuum. Substituting for velocity v = c = 3 × 108m/s, electric charge
e = 1.602 × 10−19m/s, mass of the electron me = 9.109 × 10−31kg and ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12F/m [5], we have

r > 2.813 × 10

−15m,

where we have taken Z = 1 and didn’t consider the relativistic mass. This means that we have a lower limit for
the radius of an electron’s orbit around the central nucleus, which is consistent with the experimental observed data
where radius of electronic orbits are typically of the order 10−10m.

A. Limitations of the model

Even though this model could explain some features of the atomic structure concerning the scattering data, there was
nonetheless problems that could not be explained just by classical mechanics analysis. Since protons and electrons are
charged particles, electromagnetic forces do play their role in this interaction, and according to Maxwell’s equations,
an accelerated electron emits radiation (and therefore energy), so that electrons moving around the nucleus would be
emitting energy. This radiated energy would of course lead to the downspiraling of electrons around the nucleus until
hitting it. Classical theoretical calculations done predicted that all electrons orbiting around a nucleus would hit it
in less than a second!

However, what we observe is that there is electronic stability, and therefore the model had to be reviewed.

IV. BOHR’S HYPOTHESIS

Analysis of the hydrogen spectrum which showed that only light at certain deﬁnite frequencies and energies were
emitted led Niels Bohr to postulate that the circular orbit of the electron around the nucleus is quantized, that is,
that its angular momentum could only have certain discrete values, these being integer multiples of a certain basic
value [6]. This was his “ad hoc” assumption, introduced by hand into the theory. In 1913, therefore, he proposed the
following for the atomic model [7]:
1. The atom would be composed of a central nucleus where the positive charges (protons) are located;
2. Around the central nucleus revolved the electrons in equal number as the positive charges present in the nucleus.
The electrons orbiting such a nucleus had discrete quantized energies, which meant that not any orbit is allowed but
only certain speciﬁc ones satisfying the energy quantization requeriments;
3. The allowed orbits also would have quantized or discrete values for orbital angular momentum, according to the

prescription |L| = n¯h where ¯h =
and n = 1, 2, 3, ..., which meant the electron’s orbit would have speciﬁc minimum
radius, corresponding to the angular momentum quantum number n = 1. That would solve the problem of collapsing
electrons into the nucleus.

Observe that Bohr did not use the value n = 0 because this does not deﬁne an electronic orbit around the nucleus,

h
2π

although in Plank ’s hypothesis

E = nhf

where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, ... the value n = 0, is perfectly allowed. The reason why Bohr left out this ﬁrst quantum number
out of his hypothesis comes from experiment, since spectroscopic studies of many chemical elements show that these
numbers start with n = 1.

Two colloraries following Bohr’s assumptions do follow: First, from item 2. above, the laws of classical mechanics
cannot describe the transition of an electron from one orbit to another, and second, when electrons do make a
transition from one orbit to another, the energy diﬀerence is either supplied (transition from lower to higher energy
orbits) or carried away (transition from higher to lower energy orbits) by a single quantum of light - the photon -
which has the same energy as the energy diﬀerence between the two orbits.

In this short work we propose that Bohr’s atomic orbit quantization hypothesis is not necessarily needed as an “ad

hoc” assumption, but that this can be arrived at using only Planck’s assumption of energy quantization.

First, let us follow the usual pathway where Bohr’s quantization is introduced. Using Newton’s second law for the

electron moving in a circular orbit around the nucleus, and thus subjec to Coulomb’s law, we have:

This allows us to calculate the kinetic energy of the electron in such an orbit:

The potential energy for the system proton-electron on the other hand is given by

where r is the radius of the electronic orbit.

Therefore, the total energy for the system is

This result would suggest that, since the radius can have any value, the same should happen with the angular

momentum L.

that is, the angular momentum depends on the radius. The linear momentum of the electron is given by

L = pr sin θ = pr, where θ = 900

p = mv.

Therefore the problem of quantizing the angular momentum L reduces to the quantizing of the radius r, which
depends on the total energy (9). Just here Bohr introduced an additional hypothesis, in that the angular momentum
of the electron is quantized, i.e.,

where ¯h =

. In this manner he was able to quantize the other physical quantities such as the total energy. This is

V. ORIGIN OF ORBITAL QUANTIZATION

In this work we show another way, in which we do not need the additional Bohr’s assumption input for angular
momentum quantization, but stress the importance of Planck’s original energy quantization, from which angular
momentum quantization follows as a consequence. So, from Planck’s hypothesis to quantize the energy (7)

we have that the total energy for the electron-proton system is quantized accordingly, i.e.,

so that if we take the derivative of En with respect to the frequency f we get

According to the deduction given in the Appendix, modulus its sign, the total energy for the system electron-proton

is

Knowing that the scalar orbital velocity is

where f is the frequency and r is the radius of the electronic orbit. Substituting this v into ( 16 ) we then have:

so the ratio of the system’s total energy variation with respect to the frequency is

We see that the ratio of the system ’s total energy variation with respect to the frequency plus the Planck’s

hypothesis of energy quantization leads to Bohr’s assumption.

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this work we have shown that Planck’s fundamental assumption of energy quantization is more fundamental
than Bohr’s assumption of angular momentum quantization. In fact, we have shown that Bohr’s rule for angular
momentum quantization can be dispensed of altogether if we consider Planck’s energy quantization and that the
former can be derived from this latter one.

The identity (15) can be further clariﬁed by Wilson-Sommerfeld’s rules for quantization [8]. They proposed a set of
rules to quantize any physical system whose coordinates are periodic functions of time. Their rules are the following:
For all physical systems whose coordinates are periodic functions of time there exists a quantum condition for each
coordinate expressed as:

where i labels any one of the coordinates, pi the conjugate momentum associated with such coordinate and ni a
quantum number atributed to such a coordinate.

In our case, we have,

In this Appendix we will show that the total energy for the system electron-proton depends on the scalar orbital
velocity of the elecron. From classical mechanics, an electron orbiting a proton in a circular orbit obeys the folowing
equilibrium of forces:

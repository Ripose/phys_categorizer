We study the dynamics of the cooling of a gas of caesium atoms in an optical lattice, both
experimentally and with full-quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We ﬁnd that, contrary to the
standard interpretation of the Sisyphus model, the cooling process does not work by a continuous
decrease of the average kinetic energy of the atoms in the lattice.
Instead, we show that the
momentum of the atoms follows a bimodal distribution, the atoms being gradually transferred from
a hot to a cold mode. We suggest that the cooling mechanism should be depicted in terms of a rate
model, describing the transfer between the two modes along with the processes occurring within
each mode.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Laser cooling is now a well-established technique enabling to reach temperatures of the order of the microkelvin in a
gas of atoms [1]. It has made possible Bose-Einstein condensation [2], while laser-cooled atoms are used, for instance,
in atomic clocks [3] and as frequency standards [4], and have been proposed for parity violation measurements [5] and
quantum information processing [6].

An appropriate superposition of laser beams can result in a spatially-periodic modulation of the polarisation of the
light, creating an optical lattice [7, 8, 9]. A multilevel atom with a degenerate ground state moving through such a
lattice will experience large non-adiabatic eﬀects as the light shift of the diﬀerent substates and the optical pumping
rates then depend on the position of the atom. The standard model used to explain laser cooling in optical lattices
is Sisyphus cooling [10, 11], where an atom will preferentially jump from the crest of a potential hill to the valley
of an other potential, losing kinetic energy each time. Atom dynamics can be expressed in a semi-classical way by
this model as the interplay between a velocity-dependent cooling force due to the Sisyphus eﬀect and a diﬀusion term
describing the recoil from photon absorption-emission cycles along with ﬂuctuations in the gradient force when going
from one potential curve to the other [10, 11].

Although it was predicted many years ago [10], it is only recently that experimental observations have shown non-
Gaussian velocity distributions in optical lattices [12], as well as in atomic fountains [13]. While the standard Sisyphus
model considers a cooling force linear in velocity [11], leading to a Gaussian momentum distribution, reﬁnements using
non-linear forces [10, 14] give non-Gaussian distributions, following for instance Tsallis or L´evy statistics [15, 16].
Results obtained by taking into account the localisation of the atoms around the potential minima also show deviations
from a Gaussian [17, 18]. Moreover, arguments based on a “band” picture of optical lattices [19], where some atoms
are trapped in the potential wells of the lattice while others move around in the “conduction band”, call for a bimodal
distribution [12, 20]. Indeed, it was found that a double Gaussian function provides the best ﬁt to both experimental
and simulated data for the steady state momentum distribution of atoms [12].

We report in this letter a study of the time evolution of the cooling of a gas of caesium atoms inside an optical
lattice. It provides new elements to understand the origin of the non-Gaussian momentum distributions. Apart from
a few studies concerning localisation [21, 22], diﬀusion [23], and damping rates [24, 25] of atoms in optical lattices,
this is one of the ﬁrst observation of the dynamics of the cooling process.

II. METHODOLOGY

Details of the experimental setup can be found in refs. [26, 27]. Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst accumulate 133Cs atoms in a
magneto-optical trap. We adjust the irradiance and the detuning, then we turn oﬀ the magnetic ﬁeld and leave the
atoms in an optical molasses with even further reduced irradiance and increased detuning. The atoms are thus cooled
to about 40 µK before being transfered to the optical lattice; such a “hot” initial cloud of atoms is used to reduce the
eﬀects from the initial kick given to the atoms when the lattice is turned on. The lattice itself has a 3D structure

made up from a four-beam conﬁguration [7, 9]: two laser beams are linearly polarised along the x axis and propagate
in the yz plane symmetrically with respect to the z axis, whereas the other two beams are polarised along the y
axis and propagate in the xz plane symmetrically with respect to z. This yields a tetragonal pattern of points with
pure circular polarisation, alternately σ+ and and σ−. The lasers are slightly detuned below the resonance of the
6p2P3/2) at λ = 852 nm. After a given time the optical lattice
Fg = 4
is turned oﬀ and the atoms are left to fall and then detected by a probe beam located
5 cm below the trapping
∼
region. The momentum distribution of the atoms is recovered from the time-of-ﬂight signal.

The simulation of the dynamics of the atoms in the optical lattice is carried out using a full-quantum Monte Carlo
Fe = 5 transition of caesium [12]. Due to the numerical complexity of the
wave-function method [28] for the Fg = 4
lin conﬁguration, reproducing the same alternation of σ+ and σ− potential
3D case, we restrict ourselves to a 1D lin
wells (see, e.g., ref. [8]). The time dependence of the cooling process is obtained by considering a series of diﬀerent
histories where the initial momentum of the atom is chosen randomly from a normal distribution corresponding to a
temperature of 50 µK. Observables are recovered by averaging over these histories, e.g., the momentum distribution
is obtained from the time-dependent wave functions ψh by

III. RESULTS

Sample momentum distributions obtained by the numerical simulation are given in ﬁg. 1, for a detuning of ∆ =

10Γ
and a potential well depth of U0 = 127Er, with Γ/2π = 5.2227 MHz the natural linewidth of the 6p2P3/2 level of
caesium and Er = ¯hωr the recoil energy, where ωr/2π = 2.0663 kHz is the atomic recoil frequency [29]. The momentum
is expressed in units of the recoil momentum pr = h/λ. Starting from the initial distribution at 50 µK, we clearly see
that a narrow peak gradually grows in the centre of the momentum distribution. At the same time, the population
of the wings from the initial distribution decreases and spreads out to higher momentum. It appears that the atoms
are not gradually cooled but populate progressively the central feature: they are transfered from a “hot” to a “cold”
mode. To analyse these results, we have ﬁtted the momentum distribution to a double Gaussian,

(cid:11), and fourth, (cid:10)p4

D(p) = Acold exp (cid:2)−

by ﬁnding the parameters (A and σ) that best reproduce the second, (cid:10)p2
(cid:11), moments of the dis-
tribution while conserving the norm, with the constraint σcold < σhot. This method appears better suited than the
traditional χ2 ﬁtting procedure to reproduce the wings of the distribution when the cold mode dominates. We ﬁnd,
ﬁg. 2(a), that there is no time evolution of the width σcold, hence we can assign a temperature Tcold = σ2
cold/(mkB)
to the cold mode, where m is the mass of the atom and kB the Boltzmann constant. This is another striking feature
of the cooling process, which works not only by transferring atoms between the two modes, but puts them in an
unchanging cold mode. On the other hand, atoms in the hot mode are continuously heated. We have checked that
no steady state is obtained in the hot mode for longer times. For as long as we can see, the momentum distribution
in the hot mode shows a Gaussian proﬁle in the region where it can clearly be distinguished from the cold mode.
In contrast, as can be seen in ﬁg. 2(b), the relative population of each mode (calculated as √2πAσ for a normalised
distribution) reaches a steady state after some time. By ﬁtting the population of the cold mode to an exponential
function, we recover a transfer rate of τ −1
102 s−1. This rate is about 15 times slower than the localisation
rate previously measured for caesium in a 1D lattice [21] and 2 orders of magnitude slower than the scattering rate.
The persistence of hot atoms seems to be due to the fact that some higher momentum atoms are heated and never
cooled. Indeed, starting from a lower temperature such as 5 µK leads to a greater transfer from the hot to the cold
mode, with less heating in the hot mode.

Turning now to the experimental results, we show in ﬁg. 3 the momentum distribution obtained for a laser detuning
of ∆ =
12.6Γ and an irradiance corresponding to a potential depth U0 = 217Er. (Since the simulation is for a 1D
lattice, a quantitative comparison to the experiment is not meaningful, so no attempt is made to exactly match the
parameters for both cases.) We see again the appearance of a central feature of almost constant width. The main
diﬀerence with the simulation is that after a certain time the signal decreases, as seen in ﬁg. 3(b). This is due to an
overall loss of atoms due to their diﬀusion out of the lattice and collisions with background gas, while the numerical
simulation considers an eﬀectively inﬁnite lattice. This phenomenon is probably also responsible for another diﬀerence
between the two results, namely the absence in the experimental signal of a signiﬁcant heating of the hot mode, as
the high momentum atoms seen in the simulation would quickly escape from the lattice region.

3

The result obtained by ﬁtting the experimental data to a double Gaussian is given in ﬁg. 4. Where have reverted
here to a χ2 method as a ﬁt using the moments of the distribution gave aberrant results due to the bump present in
the experimental data at negative momentum. It is clear from the time evolution of σhot (although it is noisy) that
there is no heating observed in the hot mode. This is nevertheless not necessarily contradictory with the result of
the simulation, as the decrease σhot could be explained by the preferential loss of the high momentum atoms. The
temperature in the cold mode is almost constant, the slight decrease with time being within the experimental and
ﬁtting errors. The relative populations of the two modes shown in ﬁg. 4(b) seem to indicate that a steady state is
not reached, with the cold mode continuously gaining in population, which would indicate that the loss of atoms is
through the hot mode. The rate of transfer to the cold mode is found to be of the same order as for the simulation,
with τ −1
102 s−1, which is 6 times slower than the localisation rate in a 3D lattice [21] and
400 times slower
5.8
than the scattering rate.

We ran simulations over a range of the parameters ∆ and U0 and the temperatures thus obtained for the cold mode
are given in ﬁg. 5. The variation of Tcold as a function of the well depth looks similar to that obtained in previous
studies [12, 19, 23], although the temperature was then calculated from the root-mean-square momentum. It also
appears that the temperature does not follow the linear dependence with potential depth predicted by an analytical
model of Sisyphus cooling [30] for the entire range considered here. We also note that no d´ecrochage is seen, i.e.,
there is no threshold potential below which there would be a rapid increase of the temperature. The curve of ﬁg. 5(a)
is in fact similar to the results previously obtained by considering not the r.m.s. momentum, but the width of the
distribution at 1/√e [12, 19]. The dominance of the cold mode over the hot mode is such that the width at 1/√e is
essentially equal to σcold, except for very short times. The temperature of the cold mode also varies with the detuning,
as shown in ﬁg. 5(b). This is consistent with what has been observed for rubidium [23, 25], although it appears that
Tcold decreases exponentially with

, instead of following the functional form proposed in refs. [23, 25].

IV. DISCUSSION

Our results call for a discussion of the cooling of atoms in optical lattices in terms of rates for a bimodal distribution,
based on the hypothesis that the cold and hot modes correspond to trapped and untrapped atoms, respectively. The
dominant process during the initial cooling stage is the transfer from the hot to the cold mode. Within the hot mode,
simulations show that there is an important heating eﬀect, while for the cold mode basically no heating or cooling is
seen, which means that there is a fast equilibrium reached inside the cold mode. This latter process depends on the
detuning of the lasers, as seen by the dependence of Tcold not only on the potential depth but also on the detuning.
There is also the transfer from the cold to the hot mode, which, according to simulations, is slow with respect to the
transfer from hot to cold. Otherwise, there would be a gradual depletion of the cold mode as atoms in the hot mode
are heated to the extent where they cannot go back to the cold mode. Nevertheless, under the hypothesis that cold
atoms are trapped, the loss of atoms due to diﬀusion could only be explained by a coupling from cold to hot.

To summarise, we have shown that atoms in an optical lattice follow a bimodal distribution of hot and cold atoms.
The cooling inside the lattice takes place via a transfer of the atoms from the hot to the cold mode. We suggest
that the cooling of atoms in an optical lattice be depicted in terms of a rate model, describing the transfer between
the two modes along with the processes occurring within each mode. This calls for further investigations in order to
understand by exactly which mechanism this is taking place.

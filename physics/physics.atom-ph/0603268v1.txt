We study the role of Penning ionization on the photoassociation spectra of He(23S1)-He(23S1).
The experimental setup is discussed and experimental results for diﬀerent intensities of the probe
laser are shown. For modelling the experimental results we consider coupled-channel calculations of
the crossing of the ground state with the excited state at the Condon point. The coupled-channel
calculations are ﬁrst applied to model systems, where we consider two coupled channels without
ionization, two coupled channels with ionization, and three coupled channels, for which only one of
the excited states is ionizing. Finally, coupled-channel calculations are applied to photoassociation
of He(23S1)-He(23S1) and good agreement is obtained between the model and the experimental
results.

I.

INTRODUCTION

Photoassociation spectroscopy (PAS) is a powerful
technique for the study of ultracold collisions.
In the
case of alkali-metal atoms, the technique has been used to
study long-range molecular states, the scattering length
of the interacting atoms, the lifetime of the resonant
state, and the dynamics of the interacting system [1]. In
PAS two interacting ground-state atoms absorb a photon
from the laser beam and are excited to an excited state
of the molecule. The detection of the PAS process is in
many cases performed by observation of trap loss, where
one of the interacting atoms gains suﬃcient energy in the
process to be lost from the trap. Since the relative energy
at low temperatures is small, PAS is able to produce very
high resolution spectra (<1 MHz). This allows for the de-
tailed study of singly excited molecular states, where the
interaction takes place at long range close to the dissoci-
ation limit. Since the interactions at these distance are
caused by dispersion forces, which are determined mainly
by atomic parameters, detailed comparison between the-
ory and experiment is possible for such systems. Since
the strength of the PAS resonances depends on the over-
lap between the ground and the singly excited state at
the Condon point, the progression of the intensities of
PAS lines allows for a determination of the wavefunc-
tion of the ground state and thus for a determination of
the scattering length, which is important for the achieve-
ment of Bose-Einstein condensation. Due to this feature
PAS has become a proven technique for interacting alkali-
metal atoms.

In the case of metastable rare-gas atoms, the situa-

∗Electronic address: P.vanderStraten@phys.uu.nl

tion is diﬀerent. Two interacting, metastable rare-gas
atoms have suﬃcient energy for the ionization of one
of the atoms leading to the well-known process of Pen-
ning ionization. The excitation of singly excited states
in such systems can be accompanied by a strong increase
of Penning ionization, which may prohibit the observa-
tion of narrow resonances. Although the detection of ions
and/or electrons can be much more sensitive than the de-
tection of ﬂuorescense as a measure of trap loss, observa-
tion of PAS in metastable rare-gas systems using ion de-
tection might not be the appropriate method. However,
PAS has been observed a couple of years ago using ion
detection for interacting, metastable helium atoms [2].
Since that time studies have been carried out for this sys-
tem using both ion and ﬂuorescense detection [3, 4, 5].
Recently, the results of two groups for PAS on metastable
helium atoms have been compared, where one group used
ion detection and the other group applied trap loss de-
tection [6]. The study showed, that the results of these
two diﬀerent techniques agreed within experimental reso-
lution. This is especially remarkable, since both the tem-
perature and the densities between the two experiments
diﬀered by three orders of magnitude.

In this paper we study the role of Penning ionization on
the PAS process. After discussing the technique of PAS
for metastable helium and the results of our experiment,
we introduce a pedagogical model for the PAS process,
where the ground and excited channels are coupled by the
light interaction. In this model we ﬁrst consider the inter-
action of one ground-state channel with one excited state
channel without ionization. We show how the light inter-
action leads to the observation of the resonances in the
elastic scattering rate, which can be ascribed to bound
states in the excited-state potential. We also show that
by increasing the Franck-Condon overlap between the
ground and the excited state, the resonances broaden and

shift due to the interaction with light. If we allow the ex-
cited state to become ionizing, the bound states obtain
a ﬁnite lifetime and now also lead to resonances in the
ionization cross section. The results of this two-channel
problem are compared to a semi-classical Landau-Zener
model. We ﬁnd good agreement, if we optimize the pa-
rameters of the Landau-Zener model with respect to the
coupled-channel calculations. In a next step we expand
our model by including a second, excited state and as-
suming that only one of the excited states is ionizing.
This leads to the observation of PAS resonances of the
non-ionizing channel through the coupling with the ion-
izing channel. Again, the results are compared with a
Landau-Zener model. The model clearly shows how the
Penning ionization process leads to the observation of the
PAS resonances through ionization.

Finally we apply our multi-channel model to investi-
gate PAS of the He(23S1-23S1) system. In Ref. [6] it has
been shown that all observed resonances in this system
can be attributed to the coupling of the “ground” state
channel with four excited-state channels. We solve the
multi-channel coupled equations for this system and ob-
tain good agreement with the experimental results. This
shows that the insights obtained from the simple, peda-
gogical model can be applied to this complicated system
of many coupled channels. Although the results we show
are speciﬁc for the metastable helium system, they can
easily be generalized to the other metastable rare-gas sys-
tems and also to other systems, where ineleastic processes
play an important role.

II. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup consists of two main parts, the
metastable helium source and the magneto-optical-trap
(MOT) chamber, which are separated by three diﬀeren-
tial pumping stages. Metastable He(21S) and He(23S1)
atoms are produced in a DC discharge by electron im-
pact [7]. A Pyrex glass tube with an oriﬁce of 1 mm
inserted in a Teﬂon holder is placed in a copper assem-
bly. The glass tube and nozzle assembly are placed in a
cryostat. The gas ﬂows on the outside of the glass tube
along the cold cryostat and cold nozzle, before it expands
into the vacuum chamber. Part of the gas is pumped out
through the glass tube, as in the liquid nitrogen cooled
DC-discharge source described by Kawanaka et al. [8].
However, in contrast to that source, in our design the
source is cooled to a much lower temperature of about
10-15 K by liquid helium. The nozzle is made out of an
aluminum plate of 1 mm thickness to reduce heat gra-
dients (a copper nozzle did not perform as well as an
aluminum one) and the exit hole diameter used is 0.5
mm. As a discharge needle we use a tungsten rod with
a diameter of 2 mm, which is sharpened at the end and
kept in the middle of the glass tube by ceramic spac-
ers. The optimal distance from the nozzle plate to the
discharge needle is found to be 7 mm, ensuring both a

2

high output stability and a high yield of the source. To
minimize heating eﬀects the source is operated at a low
discharge power of typically 35 mW (about 0.05 mA)
and a low discharge pressure of 10−2 mbar. The helium
discharge is localized inside the source, i.e., between the
discharge needle and the nozzle plate. This is in con-
trast to conventional metastable sources, which operate
at higher pressures (a few mbar) with a discharge burn-
ing outside the nozzle, i.e., between the discharge needle
and the skimmer, to reduce quenching of the metastable
atoms [9, 10]. We observe that operation in this manner
is only possible at higher source pressures and currents,
and therefore at higher temperatures. However, we es-
timated the quenching of the metastables in our design
to be of minor importance due to our low source pres-
sure of 10−2 mbar. Operating at minimum power and
pressure yields a total ﬂux of a 5×1012 atoms/s sr. The
mean velocity of the atoms is only 300 m/s, compared to
2000 m/s in the case of conventional sources. Since the
slowing distance for laser cooling is proportional to the
square of the initial velocity, this leads to a reduction in
slowing distance of nearly a factor 50 [7].

Therefore, the slow atoms produced can be loaded
directly in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) without the
need of a Zeeman slower. Usually a He(23S1) MOT is
loaded from a discharge source cooled with liquid nitro-
gen [11, 12, 13]. In that case, the atoms need to be slowed
in a Zeeman slower down from 1000 m/s to typically 60
m/s, before they can be captured in the MOT. Using
a Zeeman slower makes the experiment more complex,
since special care has to be taken to avoid reduction of
density of the beam at the end of the slower [14]. In a
Zeeman slower the beam is slowed down in the longitu-
dinal direction and as it is slowed down, the transverse
spreading of the beam becomes more dominant, thereby
decreasing the ﬂux in the center of the beam. This ef-
fect limits the number of atoms that can be captured in
the MOT. This can in principle be compensated for by
inserting a transverse cooling section at the end of the
slowing unit, but this will complicate the experimental
setup further.

To slow the atoms from the source at 300 m/s to the
capture velocity of the MOT (≈ 30 m/s), we slow the
atoms in the MOT chamber. The coils that generate the
MOT magnetic ﬁeld in our setup are large in diameter
(about 400 mm). These large coils produce a magnetic
ﬁeld that is suﬃcient for Zeeman slowing and thus no ad-
ditional Zeeman slower is needed. The atoms are slowed
by a counterpropagating slowing laser detuned 50 MHz
below the He(23S1- 23P2) transition with a saturation
parameter of s0 = 400. The beam still fans out in the
slowing process, but the eﬀect is smaller than for a liq-
uid nitrogen cooled source for two reasons. First, due
to the lower initial velocity of the atoms the beam does
not spread out as much during the deceleration. Second,
since the atoms are slowed down in the MOT chamber
the beam spreads out mostly in the region, where the
MOT trapping laser beams are present. This reduces

the losses considerably. The increased loading eﬃciency
fully compensates for the low ﬂux of the source and we
ﬁnd that the loading rate of the MOT from this source
and the liquid nitrogen source [11] are comparable.

The MOT laser beam is expanded by a telescope to a
beam with radius of 10 mm and the saturation param-
eter of the laser light after the telescope is s0 = 180.
The laser frequency is locked by using the saturated ab-
sorption spectroscopy 14 MHz below the He(23S1- 23P2)
transition. We trap about 3×105 atoms, as measured by
releasing the atoms onto micro-channel plates (MCP) lo-
cated 70 mm from the center of the MOT chamber. The
average density of the trapped atoms is 109 atoms/cm3
and the temperature is 1.9 mK, as measured by time-of-
ﬂight of atoms from the MOT, using the MCP.

An overview of the probe laser setup is shown in Fig. 1.
The probe laser beam is overlapped with the MOT cloud.
To obtain a high probe light intensity, the probe beam
can be focused by a lens. Additionally, a one-to-one tele-
scope is used to overlap the focus of the probe beam with
the MOT cloud. In order to calibrate the frequency scale,
two beam splitters each split oﬀ 5% of the light from the
main laser beam. One beam runs through a Fabry-P´erot
interferometer (FPI) with a free spectral range of ≈ 1
GHz and the transmitted signal is detected by a photo
diode. This is used as a relative frequency reference.
The other laser beam runs through a saturated absorp-
tion spectroscopy setup, which is used to calibrate the
oﬀset of a frequency scan with respect to the He(23S1-
23P2) transition [15].

In the experiment, pairs of cold atoms can absorb a
photon from the probe laser beam and be excited to
an long-range attractive potential. The probe laser is
scanned in frequency below the D2 line and the ionization
signal caused by Penning collisions in the MOT is studied
as a function of the probe laser frequency. The peaks ob-
served in the ion rate are attributed to vibrational states
of the excited molecules. Close to the atomic D2 reso-
nance we observe a large dip in the ionization spectrum,
which corresponds to the fact that close to resonance
atoms are heated due to the radiation pressure of the
probe laser, in which case no atoms could be trapped or
photoassociated in the MOT.

To reduce the very high count rate of Penning ioniza-
tion due to the MOT lasers, we periodically modulate
the MOT laser (with a frequency 25 kHz) with a square
wave modulation, such that during the “oﬀ” period the
MOT laser is detuned by 500 MHz below the resonance
frequency. This increases the signal-to-noise ratio consid-
erably. The spectra are recorded during the trap “oﬀ”
period and in general 20 spectra are averaged.

We have measured photoassociation spectra for various
probe laser intensities. In Fig. 2 a number of spectra are
shown which have been measured with increasing probe
laser intensities. The intensities range from s0 = 50–105.
The ﬁgure shows that, when the laser intensity increases,
ionization peaks start to appear at increasing detunings
and that the heights of the peaks become larger. Deeply

FIG. 1: Setup of the probe laser. The MOT is overlapped
with the probe laser, which is nearly collinear with one of
the MOT laser beams. A small fraction of the probe laser
light is split oﬀ for the Fabry-P´erot interferometer (FPI) for
relative frequency calibration, and for the saturation spec-
troscopy setup for a frequency reference with respect to the
He(23S1- 23P2) transition. The ions produced are detected
with multi-channel plates (MCP).

bound states can only be measured with high probe laser
intensities. The bound states that lie close to the dissoci-
ation limit are measured with low intensities since a high
intensity probe laser would disturb the cloud of atoms
in the frequency region of interest. We have measured
peaks at detunings down to ≈ 14 GHz below the D2 line.

III. THEORETICAL MODEL

A. Ground molecular state

u or 5Σ+

In the experiment, atoms are prepared in the He(23S1)
state. This state is metastable with a lifetime of 8000 s
and thus stable on the time-scale of the experiment. We
therefore consider it to be the “ground” state. Two atoms
colliding in the “ground” state interact through the 1Σ+
g ,
3Σ+
g potential. We only consider in our analysis
the 5Σ+
g state based on the fact that its multiplicity is
much higher than that of the 1Σ+
g state, and that the
3Σ+
u state is repulsive. Because of the low temperature
we also only consider s-wave scattering (l = 0).
In our calculations we use the long-range 5Σ+

g potential
as calculated by St¨arck et al. [16], given by the following

thors state that they use p = 5. However, we obtained
the best ﬁt to their data if we allowed the sum to go up
to p = 8.

B. Excited molecular states

The probe laser is detuned below the He(23S1-23P2)
transition. There are many potentials that are connected
to this asymptote, which have previously been calcu-
lated by Mastwijk et al. [11] and more recently by other
groups [17, 18]. In a joint paper by the ENS group and
our group [6] it has been shown that only four of these
potentials are relevant for the photoassociation, indicated
by 0+
u (twice), 1u and 2u (Hund’s case (c) notation). In
Figure 3 the ﬁve potentials used in the model are shown.
The 0+
u potentials are connected at short range with the
1Σ+
u potential, which ionizes with a probability pi of ∼
80%. The other two states connect at short range to
the 5Σ+
u potential, which is not ionizing. The splitting
between these potentials is due to the ﬁne structure cou-
pling. The couplings between these excited-state poten-
tials were calculated a priori and included in the model.
It should be noted that there is no direct coupling be-
tween the ionizing 0+
u states and the 2u state. That
means that the 2u channel can only couple to the ion-
izing channels via the 1u channel.

C. Extended Numerov method

The individual channels in our system without cou-
pling are described by the radial Schr¨odinger equation,
given by

d2ψ(r)
dr2 + k2(r)ψ(r) = 0,
where k2(r) ≡ 2µ[E − V (r)] and V (r) is the interatomic
potential. Furthermore, E is the relative kinetic energy
of the atoms and µ is the reduced mass of the system. To
perform the numerical calculations presented in this arti-
cle, we use an extended version of the Numerov method

to solve the radial Schr¨odinger equation [19]. In its orig-
inal form, the Numerov equation is a discretized version
of the one-channel Schr¨odinger equation. The integra-
tion domain is divided into N steps of size h, such that
rn = r0 + nh. In that case, the Numerov equation can
be written in a two-point form, which can be numerically
integrated faster [19]. In the multi-channel calculations
the wavefunction is written in matrix form, where each
row represents an asymptotic eigenstate of the system
(channel) and each column a linearly independent so-
lution. The Hamiltonian contains oﬀ-diagonal elements
that describe the couplings between these channels. For
a model system consisting of a ground state (s) and two
excited-state channels (p1, p2) with a r-independent ro-
tational coupling J between the excited states, the dif-
ference equation becomes

Fn+1 = (2I + 10Tn)ψn − Fn−1,

Here Ω is the Rabi coupling between the ground and
excited states, I is the identity matrix, Fn ≡ (I − Tn)ψn
and ki(rn) is the wavevector of state i at rn.
In this
equation the wavefunction occurs explicitly, so inversion
of (I − Tn) is needed at every integration step.

We start integrating outwards with some initial condi-
tion of the components of the wavefunction of the closed
channels. Once we pass the Condon point an excited-
state channel becomes closed. Numerically integrating
the wavefunction in a closed channel gives rise to two
solutions; a physical solution, that is exponentially de-
caying, and a non-physical solution, that is exponentially
growing. We exploit a diagonalization procedure [20] to

(4)

(5)

transform away the non-physical solution. The proce-
dure works as follows: At a point rm, where the absolute
value of one component of Fm reaches a critical value
that is much larger than unity (for example 10), which
indicates that the wavefunction has grown signiﬁcantly
and therefore that the non-physical solution has become
dominant in that channel, the inverse of Fm is calculated
and applied to all Fn with n ≤ m. This selects the ini-
tial conditions such that after integration Fm becomes
equal to the identity matrix. With respect to before the
inverse of Fm is applied, the norm of the wavefunction
at rm has decreased signiﬁcantly. In fact, it is now such
that we can conclude that the non-physical solution has
not become dominant at rm. Since the non-physical is
exponentially growing, this means that it does not have
a signiﬁcant amplitude at a short distance before rm. So
eﬀectively we have transformed away the non-physical
solution to select the “right” physical initial conditions.
After continuing with the integration, we apply the dia-
gonalization procedure again whenever the critical value
is reached. In this way we tune the initial conditions such
that the non-physical solution does not become dominant
for increasing r. The result of this procedure can be seen
in Fig. 4, which is an example for an excited-state wave-
function. From the ﬁgure it is clear that the wavefunction
is physical up to some small distance before the last point
where the diagonalization procedure is applied.

D. Accumulated phases

For metastable helium the molecular potentials in the
short-range domain (r <20a0) are not known accurately
enough to use them for our integration procedure. There-
fore we employ the accumulated phase method [21]. In
this method the eﬀect of the short-range potential is
replaced by a pre-determined phase, which represents
the phase accumulated over the short-range region. The
value of this accumulated phase will depend on the details

of the inner region of the potential, which are unknown.
However, if the potential is suﬃciently deep compared
to the energy of the bound states, this phase is inde-
pendent of the exact position of the bound states and
thus one accumulated phase is suﬃcient to calculate all
bound states close to the dissociation limit. As a re-
sult, the accumulated phases can be ﬁtted to match the
experimental results.
In the system under study some
of the channels are ionizing in the inner region through
Penning ionization. We take this into account by taking
the accumulated phase to be a complex quantity in this
case, where the real part is the actual phase shift of the
wavefunction and the imaginary part takes into account
the ionization.

F. Extracting cross sections

The key to extracting cross sections from the calcu-
lated wavefunctions is the phase shift δℓ in the open chan-
nel (ground state). This phase shift describes the asymp-
totic eﬀect of the collision between the atoms. Asymp-
totically the component of the wavefunction in the open
channel can be written as [25]

Rℓ(k, r) = Aℓ(k) (jℓ(kr) − tan δℓ(k) ηℓ(kr)) ,

(8)

where ℓ is the partial wave, jℓ and ηℓ are the spheri-
cal Bessel and Neumann functions, respectively, and the
Aℓ(k) are prefactors. As mentioned earlier, in our numer-
ical calculations we only consider ℓ = 0. In the asymp-
totic region the solution for the open channel reduces to

E.

Integration

ψs(r) = A(ks) cos δ0 sin(ksr + δ0),

(9)

For the numerical integration of the wavefunction, the
overall error in the integration is important. Blatt [22]
derived that for the Numerov method the relative error
per step ε1 can be approximated by

≈ −

ε1 =

Error in ψn+1

n ∝ h6k6 ∼ h6[E − V (r)]3.

(6)
However, as shown by Sloan [23] the error εN after many
steps becomes proportional to h4. We ﬁnd that

72

where ks is the wavenumber for the s-channel in the
asymptotic region, where it is no longer dependent on r.
The logarithmic derivative of this last equation is given
by

.

We can solve this for tan δ0 to ﬁnd [25]

tan δ0 =

ks cos(ksr) − γ(r) sin(ksr)
ks sin(ksr) + γ(r) cos(ksr)

.

(10)

(11)

(7)

The logarithmic derivative in the Numerov method is
given by [19]

This shows that it will be advantageous to have our step-
size dependent on |E − V (r)| with a smaller stepsize for
the region where V (r) is still very deep. This is the basis
for the Fourier grid method [24]. However, in our case,
where we are dealing with a few coupled equations, we
restrict ourselves to changing the stepsize h1 = h once to
a new stepsize h2 = kh1, where k is a positive integer.

In practice we use 100.000 steps for the one-channel
calculations to ﬁnd the bound states in the potentials.
The integration range runs from 20 to 900a0. Half the
number of steps are used for the ﬁrst 80a0, whereas the
other half of the steps are spread out over the remaining
800a0. For the multi-channel calculations we integrate
from 20 to 2000a0 using 10.000 points. Half these points
are equally spread between 20 and 60a0, and the other
half is spread out over the rest of the integration range.
Depending on the detuning, the Condon points for these
four potentials generally lie between 120 and 240a0 in our
calculations. Also depending on the detuning, we need to
apply the diagonalization procedure somewhere between
10 and 100 times. The total ﬂux is then conserved over
the integration range to an accuracy of more than 98%
for the ﬁnal calculations presented in this paper. This is
an indication of the accuracy of the procedure.

applied the diagonalization procedure to ensure that the
non-physical solution does not contribute to the results.

IV. MODEL CALCULATIONS

A.

Introduction

In this section we examine in detail some simple model
systems that illustrate the physics of the ionization pro-
cess in the metastable helium experiment. A theoretical
introduction is given before we describe the model sys-
tems. The model systems consist of a ﬂat ground-state
potential and one or two excited-state potentials. In both
cases one excited-state potential is ionizing. Where appli-
cable, we compare our numerical results to Landau-Zener
type calculations.

B. Avoided crossing

The potentials in the helium system were calculated
using the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and includ-
ing the eﬀects of rotational coupling between the diﬀerent
states [6, 26]. The long range potential in the “ground”
(“S+S”) state is a van der Waals 1/r6 potential and in
the range of interest to us it can be considered ﬂat. The
excited-state (“S+P”) potential has a 1/r3 behaviour at
long range. For simplicity, we add the energy of one
photon to the ground-state potential. For a negative de-
tuning δ the shifted potentials cross at the Condon point
RC , as shown in Fig. 5. Due to the coupling of the light
ﬁeld such a crossing becomes avoided and the potentials
in the vicinity of the crossing are modiﬁed.

C. Two channels without ionization

In this model we neglect for simplicity the ﬁne struc-
ture interaction in the 23P2 state. Traditionally such
a two-channel system can be approximately described
analytically using the Landau-Zener method. Using the

channel case with C3 = −10, E = 190µK and Ω = 66 MHz.
The crosses are numerical data and the line is a scaled Breit-
Wigner proﬁle with Er = −28.4374 GHz, Γ = 998.8 kHz and
φ = −3.721×10−2 rad.

approximations discussed above, we describe the poten-
tial for the “S+P” state as VS+P (r) = δ + C3/r3 with
C3 the dispersion coeﬃcient for the dipole-dipole in-
teraction. The Condon point is in this case given by
RC = (−C3/δ)1/3.

An example of a photoassociation resonance is shown
in Fig. 6, where we show the elastic cross section for the
non-ionizing case. The elastic cross section consists of
two parts. The ﬁrst part is an almost constant back-
ground, which arises from the background scattering in
the ground-state potential. The second contribution is a
resonance when the energy of the incoming atom matches
with a bound state in the excited-state potential. The
two contributions interfere coherently to form a Breit-
Wigner proﬁle [25] given by

with Er the position of the resonance, Γ the linewidth
of the resonance and φ the phase diﬀerence between the
direct scattering (the background) and the resonance.

To take a closer look at what goes on at a photoassoci-
ation resonance, we consider Fig. 7a. On the right-hand
side of this ﬁgure the bound states in part of the energy
spectrum of the C3 = −10 potential for an accumulated
phase of 0 rad at 20a0 are indicated. We assign numbers
to these bound vibrational states by counting the nodes
of the wavefunction. However, since we start to integrate
at 20a0, the number of nodes in the inner region is un-
known. As a result a state numbered n is not the nth
vibrational state of the potential, but rather a state with
number n + m, where m is an oﬀset. On the left-hand
side of Fig. 7a we show a plot of the maximum amplitude
of the excited-state wavefunction in the two-channel cal-
culation. It is clear from the graph that the wavefunction

maximizes, whenever the energy corresponds to a bound
state.

Some wavefunctions are drawn in Figs. 7b and 7c.
From Fig. 7b it is clear that the eﬀective coupling for
the three wavefunctions around the resonance is much
stronger than for the other two, as their phases are al-
tered much more dramatically. From Fig. 7c we can see
that below the resonance (the dot-dashed line) we indeed
have one node less than at resonance or above it. Also
the artiﬁcial, exponential increase of the wavefunctions
due to the renormalization procedure near the end of the
integration range is visible.

In Fig 8 we have plotted the resonance position Er,
the width Γ and the phase diﬀerence φ as a function of
the accumulated phase φs of the “S+S” potential at 20a0,
which we obtained by ﬁtting the calculated cross sections
using Eq. 15. If we change the phase of the “S+S” po-
tential, the Franck-Condon overlap between the “S+S”
and “S+P” wavefunction is changed (see Fig. 9). If the
“S+S” wavefunction has a node at the Condon point,
the overlap between the two wavefunctions is small. This
leads in Fig. 8b to a very narrow resonance for φs = 0.9π,
whereas for φs = 0.45π the overlap is maximal and thus
the width is the largest. The coupling not only leads to
a broadening of the resonance proﬁle, it also leads to a
shift of the resonance position (see Fig. 8a). This shift is
called the light shift, since it is induced by the coupling
of two potentials by the laser light. The sign of the light
shift depends on the fact, whether the overlap is stronger
for distances smaller or larger than the Condon radius
RC . For smaller distances the “S+P” potential energy
is lower than the “S+S” potential energy and thus the
coupling between the two potentials pushes the “S+P”
potential down in energy, which leads to a negative light
shift. Conversely, if the overlap is larger at distances
larger than RC , this leads to a positive light shift. Sur-
prisingly, if the overlap between the two wavefunctions is
maximal and the coupling is the strongest (φs = 0.45π),
the light shift becomes zero. This is caused by the fact
that the “S+S” wavefunction peaks at the Condon point
and the “contributions” to the light shift for smaller and
larger distances cancel. Finally, we see in Fig 8c that the
phase diﬀerence φ is directly proportional to the accu-
mulated phase φs, which is to be expected in this simple
model.

D. Two channels with ionization

We extend our model by adding an ionization process
in the inner region of the excited-state potential and con-
sidering also the inelastic cross section. An example of a
resonance in the inelastic cross section is shown in Fig. 10.
Exactly as the elastic cross section, it contains resonances
from bound states in the excited-state potential, which
take the form of Lorentz proﬁles due to the absence of a

For comparison, we develop a semi-classical picture, in
which a metastable helium atom comes in on the “S+S”
potential. At the Condon point, we denote with pc the
probability that the atom follows the adiabatic route to
the “S+P” potential. The probability that the atom ion-
izes in the inner region of the “S+P” potential is des-
ignated with pi. From the inner regions of the two po-

where Ω is the Rabi frequency between the ground and
excited state, α is the diﬀerence in derivatives of the po-
tentials at the Condon point, and vc is the velocity of
the incoming atom at the Condon point. For a kinetic
energy E of 1.9 mK, a Rabi frequency of 66 kHz and a
detuning of δ = −28.4 GHz, we ﬁnd pc = 8.84×10−10.

One should note that in such a semi-classical treatment
of the problem we can no longer treat the dependence in
δ and only the total ionization probability is calculated.
Quantum mechanically, however, we calculate cross sec-
tions that are a function of δ. As a measure of the total
ionization probability, we have therefore taken the total
area underneath one peak of the inelastic cross section.
Although the integrated inelastic cross section obtained
in this way is proportional to the total ionization proba-
bility, we lack a method to map the quantum-mechanical
results onto the semi-classical picture. Therefore we can
only compare the two methods with respect to their qual-
itative behavior as a function of the ionization probability

pi, but not with respect to the absolute total ionization
probability PI they give rise to.

In Fig. 12 we plotted the results of both calculations as
a function of the probability pi. We normalized for large
pi the total amplitude of the numerical calculation to the
total ionization probability calculated semi-classically. If
we allow pc to be an adjustable parameter, the best ﬁt
is for pc = 4.59×10−10, which is about half the Landau-
Zener value. Note, that the Landau-Zener formula de-
scribes a single crossing, whereas in the current situation
the atoms vibrates back and forth over the crossing lead-
ing to interference eﬀects. From the ﬁgure it can be seen
that the widths of the resonances are increasing as a func-
tion of pi, but their heights reach a maximum around the
point where PI reaches its asymptote.

E. Three channels with ionization

Next we consider the case where we have two excited-
state potentials. We take both excited potentials to be-
long to the same “S+P” asymptote, but have slightly
diﬀerent C3 values. These potentials will be denoted
“S+P1” (C3 = −9) and “S+P2” (C3 = −10). Only the
“S+P1” potential leads to Penning ionization at short in-
ternuclear distance. The potentials are coupled by a ro-
tational coupling with a probability pj, which acts over a
large distance. This system is depicted in Fig. 13. Since
the eﬀective coupling between two potentials is propor-
tional to the wavefunction overlap and the wavefunctions
of the closed channels have a maximum close to their
Condon points, we expect the rotational coupling to be
most eﬀective before the ﬁrst Condon point. For the

semi-classical treatment of the total ionization probabil-
ity PI , we assume that the coupling only takes place at
this point, and that the atom can make a transition from
one “S+P” potential to another both on the way in and
on the way out. Furthermore, in the Landau-Zener model
the transfer probability depends quadratically on the oﬀ-
diagonal term in the Hamiltonian.

In Fig. 14 we consider the resonance at δ = −28.4 GHz,
where we assume that the two states are coupled to the
ground state with the same Rabi frequency. Since the
Rabi frequency is large, the resonances from the “S+P1”
potential are so wide that they overlap to a large extent.
In contrast, bound states in the non-ionizing “S+P2”
potential will give rise to much sharper peaks in the in-
elastic cross section, because only the part of the wave-
function coupled to the ionizing “S+P1” potential can
lead to ionization. The inelastic cross section thus con-
tains a background part caused by direct ionization in the
“S+P1” channel, which interferes with resonances from
the bound states in the “S+P2” potential. This leads to
a Breit-Wigner proﬁle with a non-constant background.
The result of this interference can be quite unpredictable
and instead of ﬁtting the proﬁles we choose to numer-
ically integrate the area underneath the resonance as a
measure of the ionization probability.

To solve the semi-classical problem, we draw a ﬂux dia-
gram containing all the possible paths of the system. For
every intersection in this diagram we write down an equa-
tion, and combine these equations into a set of coupled
linear equations that is solved analytically. The solution
for the total probability PI is given by

quency is Ω = 6.6 MHz for both couplings to the excited state,
an ionization probability pi = 0.80 in “S+P1” and an energy
of E = 2.0 mK. For the thermal averaging the temperature is
E/kB.

probabilities are given by p1 = 8.84×10−6 and p2 =
8.54×10−6, where the small diﬀerence stems from the
fact that the “S+P1” potential is less steep at its Con-
don point than the “S+P2” potential.

In Fig. 15 we compare the semi-classical and numeri-
cal calculations as a function of the rotational coupling
pj. The value of PI for large pj is determined by p1,
whereas for small pj it is determined by p2. To get good
agreement between the numerical analysis and the semi-
classical description we have adjusted the parameters p1
and p2 and ﬁnd p1 = 9.12×10−7 and p2 = 3.60×10−7.
Note that the relatively large diﬀerence between these
two parameters, which are nearly identical in the Landau-
Zener description (see above), reﬂects the fact that for
these two states the Franck-Condon overlap with the
“ground” state at the Condon point can be very diﬀer-
ent and thus that the behavior is dominated by Franck-
Condon factors. Although the factors p1 and p2 calcu-
lated this way do not each have physical signiﬁcance,
their ratio p1/p2 has. Numerically, we calculate this ra-
tio to be 2.53, whereas Landau-Zener description yields
1.04. Clearly, we have to resort to quantum mechani-
cal methods to solve this model, since the Landau-Zener
formula assumes isolated avoided crossings, whereas we
have two crossings lying close to each other. From Fig. 15
it is clear that with the ﬁtted parameters p1, p2 and pj
the agreement between our numerical calculations and
the semiclassical result is very good.

ple. We investigate the eﬀect of the thermal distribution
by integrating the proﬁles over a Maxwell-Boltzmann
thermal distribution. The eﬀect of the thermal averaging
depends on the width of a single resonance compared to
the Doppler shifts. In Fig. 14 we show a plot of the reso-
nance at δ = −28.4 GHz in the inelastic cross section for
a relative energy E = kBT and for a thermal distribu-
tion. In the latter the dip has largely disappeared. This
is as expected, as the Doppler width and the resonance
width are about the same size here (∼6×10−9 Eh).

V. COMPARISON BETWEEN THEORY AND
EXPERIMENT

Now we return to the numerical treatment of the exper-
iment. As is clear from the previous section, the location
of resonances in the inelastic cross section depends on
the accumulated phases in the non-ionizing (1u and 2u)
channels. In order to determine the accumulated phases,
we ﬁrst have to identify the resonances belonging to one
particular potential.
In a combined eﬀort between our
group and the group at ENS in Paris [6] this has been
done for this system. This eﬀort is based on the fact
that all the resonances in one potential have (at least
approximately) the same accumulated phase. So by cal-
culating the accumulated phases needed to reproduce all
resonances, one can group the resonances together.

As mentioned before, we are left with two sets of res-
onances; one for the 1u potential and one for the 2u po-
tential. Table I is a list of the resonances in the two
channels. For both of these potentials we calculate the
bound states as a function of the accumulated phase in
a simple one-channel calculation. Selecting the accumu-
lated phase that correctly reproduces one resonance of

that potential indeed reproduces all the other resonances
of that channel at the correct positions. The phases cal-
culated using this procedure are 0.368π for the 1u po-
tential and 0.429π for the 2u potential. These turn out
not to be the entirely correct phases to use in the multi-
channel calculations, especially so for the 2u potential. In
general, in calculations performed for the simple models
of the previous section, accumulated phases for one and
multi-channel calculations matched as expected. That
this is not the case here is due to the strong coupling
between the excited-state potentials, which causes the
resonances to shift. This explanation is supported by
model calculations for the three-channel model, in which
the resonances are observed to shift for strong rotational
coupling between the excited-state channels. Through
ﬁtting with experiment we ﬁnd the accumulated phases
to be 0.363π for the 1u potential and 0.445π for the 2u
potential. This means that the rotational coupling has
an eﬀect on the exact location of the resonances. The
accumulated phases of the two ionizing excited-state po-
tentials have no inﬂuence on the spectrum and we simply
take these phases equal to zero.

A. Accumulated phase ground state

In the previous section we discussed the selection of the
appropriate accumulated phases for the excited states.
However, also in the ground-state channel we need to
select the correct accumulated phase. This phase has
a very large inﬂuence on the s-wave scattering length
as this scattering length depends directly on the ﬁnal
phase shift of the wave function. Recently Moal et al. [27]
measured it very accurately to 141.96 ± 0.09 a0. We
choose the accumulated phase for the ground state to
match this value using [25]

a = − lim
k→0

δ0

,

(20)

where a is the s-wave scattering length. We use a low
energy of 19 µK and a low laser intensity of s0 = 10.
That way we ﬁnd the accumulated phase to equal 0.939π.

This is because for small detunings many bound states
are available in the excited-state channels. Therefore a
very large number of resonances of those channels con-
tribute to an increased ionization rate. Note, that for
small detunings our assumption that we only have s-wave
scattering breaks down.

B. Spectrum

To obtain a numerical spectrum that we can compare
with experimental results, we use the accumulated phases
from the previous sections and we integrate over a ther-
mal distribution as explained in Sec. IV F. Figure 16a
is calculated for a temperature of 1.9 mK and a laser
saturation parameter of s0 = 1×104. The former is in
accordance with experiment, the latter is low in com-
parison with experiment. A comparison with the exper-
imental spectrum that is reproduced in Fig. 16b shows
that we successfully reproduce the resonances at the cor-
rect positions. Both spectra contain resonances that have
widths in between roughly 100 and 200 MHz. However,
the thermal eﬀects do not cause enough smearing of the
resonances to make the resonances symmetric in our cal-
culations, whereas they look completely symmetric in the
experimental data. The theoretical spectrum contains
also a much higher peak-to-background ratio than the
experimental data. Note that also the so-called optical
collisions, i.e., the increase of the background level as we
approach zero detuning, is present in our calculations.

To study in more detail the eﬀects that determine the
line widths of the resonances in the numerical spectrum,
we perform the same calculation as in the previous para-
graph, but now for diﬀerent temperatures. The results
can be found in Fig. 17. The ﬁgure shows that a higher
temperature will lead to a slightly narrower resonance.
This is counterintuitive, since one would expect that a
higher temperature leads to a larger Doppler broadening.
This is also observed for the model systems of Sec. IV.
In this case the width of a resonance seems to be deter-
mined by other eﬀects. This is in accordance with what
is observed in the experiment.

One possible suggestion is that the line widths are de-
termined by the last oscillation of the bound state at
the Condon point. This ﬁnal part of the wavefunction is
much larger than the remainder of the wavefunction, and
thus could therefore dominate the Franck-Condon factor.
Its projection on the potential gives us the distance over
which photoassociation can occur, and thereby also the
range of detunings that contribute to the photoassocia-
tion process. In Fig. 18 we show that at the temperature
used in the experiment the contribution to the Franck-
Condon factor of the other oscillations is signiﬁcant. Fur-
thermore the last oscillation covers a range of the order
of 50a0, leading to a detuning range of 10 GHz. This is
much wider than the resonance widths observed in the
experiment, and we conclude that this last oscillation is
not the limiting factor for the resonances studied.

He2(23S1-23S1) system. We have shown that the reso-
nances in experimental ionization rates are due to bound
states in the long-range potentials near the 23S1-23P2
asymptote that are reached through photoassociation.
We can describe this process with the multi-channel
model discussed in Sec V, where the coupling between
bound, ionizing channels and bound, non-ionizing chan-
nels leads to well-resolved peaks in the ionization spec-
trum. Although the line shape is not completely un-
derstood from the model, the location of the lines is in
good agreement with the predictions of the model. The
study shows that photoassociation spectroscopy is a pow-
erful technique at ultracold temperatures even in systems
where inelastic processes play a major role.

We consider a new type of trap-induced resonance [1] in the case of two 133Cs atoms, trapped
in separated wells of a polarization-gradient optical lattice, and interacting through a multichannel
scattering process. Due to the anomalously large scattering length of cesium dimers, a strong
coupling can occur between vibrational states of the trap and a weakly bound molecular state
that is made resonant by the ac-Stark shift of the lattice. We calculate the energy spectrum of
the two-atom system as a function of the distance between two potential wells by connecting the
solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation for the short-range molecular potential to that of the long-
range trap in a self-consistent manner. The short-range potential is treated through a newly derived
multichannel pseudopotential, parametrized by the K-matrix, calculated numerically for atoms in
free space in a close-coupling approximation. This captures both the bound molecular spectrum
as well as the energy-dependent scattering for all partial waves. We establish realistic operating
conditions under which the trap-induced resonance could be observed and show that this strong and
coherent interaction could be used as a basis for high-ﬁdelity two-qubit quantum logic operations.

INTRODUCTION

Ultracold atoms in tightly conﬁning traps are of in-
terest in a variety of physics disciplines, with impor-
tant applications to the study of quantum degenerate
gases and the implementation of quantum information
processors [2]. At the heart of these systems are two-
body atomic interactions whose extreme controllability
via magnetic Feshbach resonances [3] has opened the door
to the exploration of new phenomena such as the dynamic
collapse of a Bose Einstein Condensate [4], the produc-
tion of ultracold molecules [5, 6], and the observation
of the BEC/BCS crossover [7, 8, 9]. Strong conﬁnement
and reduced dimensionality can have a large eﬀect on the
tunability of the atomic coupling constant [10, 11, 12, 13].
For example, quasi 1D Bose systems, where the atomic
gas is strongly conﬁned in two directions, lead to forma-
tion of the Tonks-Girardeau gas whose elementary ex-

tem, as observed in an optical lattice system of tightly
conﬁned 1D tubes [14], a resonance in the eﬀective 1D
coupling strength occurs, leading to strong repulsive in-
teractions so that exchange of atoms is suppressed [10].
Recently, the origin of this resonance has been attributed
to a Feshbach-like, conﬁnement-induced resonance that
is associated with a bound state of a closed scattering
channel in the transverse mode [15]. This resonance is
of particular importance since it allows for the control of
the eﬀective 1D interaction strength and exploration of
diﬀerent regimes of the BEC vs. the Tonks-gas by sim-
ply varying the conﬁnement of atoms in the transverse
direction.

Concurrently with the exploration of these conﬁnement
induced resonances, we have predicted a “trap-induced
resonance” [1] (TIR) for two atoms in separate, but
nonoverlapping, tightly conﬁning potential wells, such as
the sites of a polarization gradient lin-θ-lin optical lat-
tice [16]. This phenomenon arises when a weakly bound
molecular state of the dimer is shifted by the potential
energy (ac-Stark shift) of the separated wells into reso-
nance with a vibrational eigenstate of the trap. In con-
trast, optical Feshbach resonances [17], also induced by
oﬀ-resonant laser couplings, arise due to strong mixing of
excited-state bound molecules with the ground unbound
states and are generally accompanied by inelastic pro-
cesses. Here, the strong gradients in the ac-Stark eﬀect
produced by conﬁning optical potentials is suﬃcient to
make ground-state molecules resonant with atomic trap
eigenstates, but with tunability diﬀerent from the mag-
netic Feshbach resonances arising from the Zeeman shift.
The TIR thus provides a new handle for coherently con-
trolling two-atom ground-state interactions.

In this article, we evaluate the feasibility of observ-
ing these resonances in a particularly promising species,
133Cs, trapped in optical lattices. The enormous scat-
tering length of 133Cs, arising from a very weakly bound
molecular state near dissociation, leads to the possibility
of creating trap-induced resonances under realistic ex-
perimental circumstances. For a complete description of
the atomic interactions, we develop a multichannel scat-
tering model based on the generalized pseudopotential
presented in [18]. Using this model, we calculate the
two-atom energy spectrum under reasonable operating
conditions. The remainder of this article is organized as
follows. In Sec. II we review the basic physics of the TIR
and its generalization to a multichannel scattering inter-
action. We apply this formalism to the speciﬁc case of
133Cs in Secs. III and IV, and conclude with a discussion

in Sec. V.

II. BACKGROUND

A. Trap-induced resonances

We review here the salient features of the TIR [1]. Con-
sider two interacting atoms in spatially separated har-
monic traps, described by the center of mass and relative
coordinate Hamiltonians,

where M = 2m and µ = m/2 are total and reduced
masses, respectively. Though the two atoms may be
identical, we assume they are eﬀectively distinguished by
their internal states. The traps for the two atoms are
separated in the z-direction by ∆z. Since the character-
istic length scale of the van der Waals interaction, β6, is
typically much smaller than the size of the trap ground
state [12, 19], the interatomic interaction ˆVint(r) can be
replaced by a contact “pseudopotential” for s-wave scat-
tering,

ˆVeﬀ (r, EK ) =

aeﬀ (EK)δ(r)

r .

Note, that we parameterize the pseudopotential with
an energy-dependent scattering length aeﬀ(EK ) [1, 19].
This is particularly important for strong interactions out-
side the Wigner threshold regime.
In addition, such a
pseudopotential not only describes the complete energy-
dependent scattering behavior but also the bound state
spectrum if the scattering length is analytically continued
to negative energies and the Hamiltonian’s eigenvalues
are found self-consistently.

The energy spectrum associated with Eq. (1) is easily
understood in two limits. When ∆z → ∞ interactions
are negligible and the spectrum is a harmonic ladder in
three dimensions. When ∆z → 0 we map to the prob-
lem of two atoms in a harmonic trap, interacting via
a δ-function potential in three dimensions, parameter-
ized by the scattering length a. The spectrum of this
problem was solved by Busch et al. [20] and generalized
to higher partial wave interactions in [18, 21], reveal-
ing positive (negative) energy shifts of the harmonic lad-
der for a > (<)0 that saturate at ~ω for |a| → ∞. In
addition, for a > 0, the spectrum includes a perturbed
bound-state of the δ-function potential representing the
near-dissociation molecular bound state associated with
a positive scattering length in a physically attractive po-
tential.

For intermediate separations ∆z we treat the term
(µω2∆z)r cos θ as a perturbation to the Busch solution

2

and rediagonalize the Hamiltonian. This is done for a
range of scattering lengths to determine E(a). We then
solve independently the problem of the scattering length
as a function of kinetic energy, a(EK ) for a given real-
istic interaction potential between the particles in free
space. We numerically search for the self-consistent solu-
tion, setting EK = E(a) − V∆z, where V∆z = µω2∆z2/2
is the potential energy the two particle must overcome to
collide at zero range. This procedure allows us to sepa-
rate the long-range behavior of the wave function from its
short-range behavior and then match them in one self-
consistent solution. This is particularly important for
solving realistic atom interaction where molecular poten-
tials have the range of angstroms whereas the trap scale
is on order of many nanometers.

To verify the use of the energy-dependent pseudopo-
tential approximation, we have employed a spherically
symmetric step potential as a toy model of the molec-
ular binding [1]. For this problem, we can ﬁnd an an-
alytic solution for the scattering phase-shift from which
we deduce the energy-dependent scattering length. The
self-consistent solution is compared with the full numeri-
cal solution to the toy problem for a potential with large
positive scattering lengths at zero energy. For atoms in
very tight traps, as the separation is increased, the trap-
ping potential can be strong enough to raise a bound
state of the molecular interaction to positive energies [see
Figure 1 (a)-(b)]. Avoided crossings occur in the eigen-
spectrum for certain separations where the energy of this
molecular bound state becomes resonant with the eigen-
states of the trap potential [see Figure 1 (c)]. This eﬀect
generally occurs if the interaction potential for the free
atoms possesses a molecular bound state very close to
dissociation, i.e.
the scattering length in free space is
positive and on the order of or larger than the size of
the trap ground state. Here, the self-consistent solution,
which employs an energy-dependent scattering length, is
crucial; a constant scattering length approximation does
not capture the location of the bound state and the re-
sulting energy gap accurately. Also note that in this case,
analytic continuation of the scattering length to negative
energies is essential. The TIR occurs through a tunneling
barrier as the trap distorts the atomic potential at dis-
tances large compared to the range of the molecular bind-
ing. As such we probe the “negative energy” spectrum
of the interaction (with respect to free particle collisions)
and the scattering length used for the self-consistent so-
lution is taken at the, usually negative, kinetic energy in
the system.

B. The multichannel pseudopotential
approximation

The model presented thus far involves only single chan-
nel elastic scattering. A complete analysis of the TIR for
a given atomic species requires a generalization of the
pseudopotential to multiple scattering channels, includ-

ing the full spin-dependent nature of the cold-collision
process via the hyperﬁne and exchange interactions, and
higher-order partial-wave scattering. We thus require
a multichannel matrix generalization of the scattering
length that parameterizes the pseudopotential operator,
thus allowing the inclusion of both elastic and inelastic
processes. We accomplish this by solving the Schr¨odinger
equation for two interacting particles in free space in a
standard close-coupling expansion of the total wave func-
tion with good quantum numbers (J, M, Π), the total an-
gular momentum, its projection on the internuclear axis,
and parity respectively [22],

expressed in terms of the K-matrix [23]. Typically,
the scattering length is deﬁned by the scattering phase-
shift via the S-matrix. As we will see, however, in the
pseudopotential approximation described below, it is ad-
vantageous and more appropriate to deﬁne a scattering
length matrix through the K-matrix. As proven in detail
below, basing the deﬁnition of the pseudopotential on
the K-matrix allows us to correctly match the scatter-
ing boundary conditions for the asymptotic wave func-
tions in Eq. (5).
In addition, note that our deﬁnition
of the reduced Bessel functions diﬀers in phase conven-
tion from [22]; for closed channels these function are pure
imaginary.

The objective of the pseudopotential formalism is to
replace the exact atomic interaction potential at all en-
ergies, for all partial waves, and for all channels by a
zero-range pseudopotential. In [18] we showed how such
a pseudopotential could be constructed for an arbitrary
partial wave using the limit of a δ-shell of radius s, in the
limit s → 0. We generalize here to a multichannel version
of this pseudopotential, including anisotropic couplings.

A pseudopotential with an energy-dependent scattering
length matrix has the same properties as the single chan-
nel pseudopotential, capturing the complete scattering
and bound-state properties of the participating chan-
nels [1, 18].
It will further allow us to continue the
scattering-length matrix element for the channel of in-
terest to negative energies, which are crucial for the case
of atoms in separated traps (see Sec. III).

Using the deﬁnition in Eq. 6, we take as our an ansatz

functions Jγ(r) and the null operator on the irregular

deﬁne here the pseudopotential to act on the reduced ra-
dial wave functions. The solution to the radial equation
for the pseudopotential has the form,

III. CALCULATION OF THE SCATTERING
LENGTH MATRIX OF CESIUM FOR POSITIVE
AND NEGATIVE ENERGIES

The cold collision properties of 133Cs are anomalous
due to the existence of a bound state of the 3Σ+
u molecu-
lar potential very close to dissociation [24] and the large
second-order spin-orbit coupling [25]. Whereas the for-
mer property leads to extremely large triplet scattering
lengths and possible trap-induced resonances, the latter
implies possible strong inelastic collision channels. As
such, a realistic modeling of the scattering is necessary
to study the feasibility of observing the TIR. We will ac-
complish this using the numerical solution to the close-
coupling equations (4) developed at NIST [26] based
on the best known cesium dimer interaction potentials,
recently reﬁned through spectroscopic measurements of
Feshbach resonances [25]. The multichannel scattering
solutions will allow us to determine the energy-dependent
scattering-length matrix as input to the pseudopotential
Eq. (8).

Figure 2 shows the atomic hyperﬁne states and mag-

est is the two-atom combination in the stretched states,
|api, with a total angular momentum projection quan-
tum number of mtotal = mf 1 + mf 2 = 7 . This channel
is of particular interest since, in the absence of any spin-
motion coupling, conservation of angular momentum im-
plies conservation of these quantum numbers. For this
reason, the equivalent of states a and p for 87Rb were
the ones originally considered for entangling atoms via
ultracold ground-state collisions [27]. For 133Cs atoms,
this desirable property is not automatically satisﬁed due

TABLE I: Participating channel information. The channel of
interest is |api (channel 9), which deﬁnes the zero of energy
(in atomic units au). The ﬁrst thirty channels are open, of
which the ﬁrst eight channels are the ones with both atoms
in the lower hyperﬁne manifold. Channels 31 to 49 are closed
channels with both atoms in the f = 4 manifold. The channel
states are labeled following the conventions of Fig. 2 (columns
3 and 5). The table includes the magnetic quantum numbers
mf for each atom (column 4 and 6), the total magnetic quan-
tum number mtotal (column 7) and the partial wave quantum
number l (last column).

to the higher-order spin-orbit interaction [24, 25], which
couples a multitude of open and closed scattering chan-
nels. In our calculation, 49 channels were included in the
close-coupling set (see Table I).

The set of close-coupled equations for the reduced ra-
dial wave functions of the participating channels is inte-
grated from an initial radius ri to a ﬁnal radius rf using
a standard renormalized Numerov method [28, 29] for
both open and closed channels. There, the logarithmic
derivative matrix mγ′,γ(rf ) is calculated for the reduced
wave functions Fγ′,γ(r) according to

mγ′,γ(rf ) =

∂
∂r Fγ′,γ(r)|r=rf
Fγ′,γ(rf )

.

(16)

Matching the logarithmic derivative to the asymptotic

wave function, we can determine the K-scattering matrix
from mγ′,γ(rf ) according to

Kγ′,γ =

Nγ′(rf )mγ′,γ(rf ) − N ′

(cid:3)

(17)

(cid:3)

(cid:2)
Here, J ′
γ′(rf ) and N ′
γ′(rf ) are the derivatives of the re-
duced spherical Bessel functions at r = rf . The K-matrix
then deﬁnes the scattering length matrix that is appro-
priate for use in the generalized multichannel pseudopo-
tential as discussed in the previous section. Note that
in order to get a convergent value of the K-matrix, the
ﬁnal integration radius, rf , can be larger than the typical
size of the ground state in an optical lattice site. This
might raise doubts about the validity of the pseudopoten-
tial approximation in an optical lattice system, since the
eﬀective scale of the interaction seems to be much larger
than the trap size. However, as shown in Refs. [12, 19], it
is the characteristic β6 length scale that eﬀects the valid-
ity of the pseudopotential approximation. As long as the
trapping potential does not distort the chemical binding
potential, it is valid to calculate the energy-dependent
scattering length in free space and use this as the input to
the self-consistent solution in the trap. Since β6 = 100a0
in 133Cs, and therefore much smaller than typical trap
sizes in tight optical lattices, we can safely approximate
the interaction by a pseudopotential.

As discussed in Sec. II A, negative energy scattering be-
comes important for two atoms in nonoverlapping traps
due to the tunneling barrier created by the trapping po-
tential. In this case, the scattering channels of interest
are closed and we must extend the K-matrix to include
these channels. This can be achieved by simply contin-
uing the reduced spherical Bessel functions Jγ(rf ) and
Nγ(rf ) to negative energies by using a purely imaginary
wave vector, k = iκ, and allowing a complex argument
of the Bessel functions (note, in our convention for the
reduced Bessel function, these functions are pure imag-
inary). The complete K-matrix, which is Hermitian for
open channels and anti-Hermitian for closed channels, is
calculated using Eq. (17). Figures 3(a-f) show the diago-
nal scattering length matrix element for the |api channel
as a function of the stopping point rf for various nega-
tive energies. At negative energies, we expect the codes
to converge in the calculation of a|api only for a small
range of rf . The close-coupled equations need to be inte-
grated far enough into the asymptotic regime where the
interaction potential vanishes. However, for very large r,
we expect the wave function to diverge exponentially and
the numerical Numerov codes to become unstable. We
expect the region of convergence to decrease for larger
negative energies, since the wave function diverges as
exp (+κr) (see Figures 3). As seen in Fig. 3, we can re-
liably calculate a scattering length for negative energies
as low as −10µK. The calculation errors in the scatter-
ing length of Fig. 4 can be estimated from Figs. 3 to be
around 5% at −10µK whereas for smaller negative en-
ergies of around −1µK the error can be estimated to be

While the K-matrix describes the asymptotic boundary

conditions and is therefore essential in the pseudopoten-
tial description, the scattering S-matrix is a measure of
the coupling between diﬀerent channels. These inelas-
tic processes and the resulting loss from the channel of
interest are therefore more appropriately described by a
complex scattering length deﬁned through the S-matrix,
which is related to the K-matrix by,

S ≡ [1 + iK] [1 − iK]−1 .

The imaginary part of the scattering length is a mea-
sure of the “loss” from the scattering channel γ to all
other open channels. Note that the imaginary part of
the scattering length not only measures the inelastic col-
lisions but also includes the coherent couplings to chan-
nels in the same hyperﬁne manifold. Figure 5 shows the
real and imaginary part of the complex scattering length
for positive energies. For scattering energies below 4µK,
the imaginary part is several orders smaller than the real
part of the scattering length. In this regime, couplings to
other channels that are due to spin-spin or spin-orbit cou-
pling can be neglected and the total magnetic quantum
number mtotal is approximately conserved. This implies
that, in this energy regime, interactions of atoms |api
can be treated to good approximation as single channel
scattering.

diﬀerent resonances, i.e. the labeling of the resonances
by the corresponding bound-states, is left for future in-
vestigation. The resonances are very narrow (less than

sensitivity in the atomic interactions.

IV. TRAP-INDUCED SHAPE RESONANCES
OF CESIUM IN OPTICAL LATTICES

We consider a 3D optical lattice, created by three pairs
of linearly polarized counter-propagating laser beams.
Along one direction we allow for polarization gradients
in a lin-angle-lin conﬁguration [16] which shifts σ+ and
σ− standing waves and carries atoms in appropriate sub-
levels together from neighboring sites and probes the
TIR. We approximate the optical lattice wells by har-
monic oscillator potentials with frequency ω with

~ω = 2

VppER .

(21)

p
Vpp is the peak-to-peak depth of the optical lattice po-
tential and ER is the recoil energy of a 133Cs atom.
The Lamb-Dicke parameter, which measures the local-
ER/~ω = kl¯r0,
ization of atoms in the lattices, η =
~/2mω is the FWHM of the harmonic-
where ¯r0 =
oscillator ground state of a single atom (mass m). As
we deal with relative motion of two atoms, we choose to
scale in terms of characteristic harmonic oscillator units
r0 =

For the observation of a TIR for the |api-channel, we
require r0 to be on the order of, or much smaller than, the
scattering length which takes the value a|api ≈ 2500a0 ≈
132 nm in the negative energy regime oﬀ interest.

Vpp. An optical lattice with a Lamb-Dicke parameter of
η = 0.25, Vpp = 64ER, ~ω = 16ER, and ¯r0 ≈ 34 nm
fulﬁlls all these requirements and still allows a reliable
harmonic approximation to the optical lattice potential.
Also, for 133Cs the β6 parameter is on the order of 100a0
or 5.3nm, i.e. much smaller than ¯r0, therefore allowing
a reliable approximation of the interaction via a δ-shell
pseudopotential.

Figure 7(a) shows the calculated energy spectrum for
133Cs atoms in separated harmonic isotropic traps as a
function of trap separation ∆z, assuming an optical lat-
tice with a Lamb-Dicke parameter of η = 0.25. The en-
ergy eigenvalues are calculated self-consistently at each
separation as described in Section II A using the energy-
dependent scattering length for 133Cs, which is shown
in Fig. 7(b) in harmonic oscillator units. This plot of
the scattering length nicely illustrates the necessity of
the application of an energy-dependent pseudopotential
because of the strong energy dependence of the scatter-
ing length in the energy range of interest. A constant
scattering-length approximation would misestimate the
location of the bound-state and therefore the size of the
avoided crossing in the energy spectrum. Fig. 7(a) shows

form of the avoided crossing, which in the case of 133Cs
results in an almost maximal (compare to Fig. 3 (inset)
in Ref. [1]) energy gap of about ~ω/2.

Controlled ultracold collisions, using two-atom Ram-
sey interferometry in polarization gradient optical lat-
tices, have been demonstrated by Mandel et al. [31]. Such
experiments can be used to probe the TIR as shown in
In a linearly polarized lattice, atoms in their
Fig. 8.
vibrational ground state are placed in an equal super-
position of the states |ai and |pi. These two states are
transported in opposite directions as the polarizations are
rotated by an angle θ into a lin-angle-lin conﬁguration.
As θ approaches π, neighboring atoms in the |api chan-
nel collide. The scattering phase shift φ entangles these
atoms, maximally so when φ = π. In the experiment of
Mandel et al., a ﬁlled lattice was prepared in a Mott in-

sulator with one atom per site, loaded from from a Bose-
Einstein condensate [32]. Controlled collisions lead to an
“entangled chain” of atoms (the 1D cluster state [33] in a
perfectly ﬁlled lattice and for π phase shift). The periodic
disappearance and reappearance of single atom Ramsey
fringes due to this entanglement is a measurement of the
scattering phase shift. For the case at hand, assuming
adiabatic transport, this is the phase shift accumulated
along the ground energy curve. At a critical separation
between the atoms, a large (negative) phase shift will be
accumulated, providing a signature of the TIR. By con-
trolling the ﬁnal separation and hold time of the atoms,
one can in principle map the full adiabatic energy curve.

V. SUMMARY

In this paper we have considered a trap-induced res-
onance between a molecular bound state and a trap vi-
brational state for two 133Cs atoms in overlapping but
separated traps. To study the interaction between re-
alistic alkali atoms with hyperﬁne structure, we gen-
eralized the δ-shell pseudopotential, introduced in [18],
to the case of multichannel scattering parameterized by
the K-matrix. Using a numerical solution to the close-
coupling equations and a self-consistent solution to the
Schr¨odinger equation, we calculated the energy spectrum
for 133Cs atoms interacting on the stretched-state chan-

8

nel, |f = 3, mf = 3i |f = 4, mf = 4i, as a function of trap
separation. The large energy gap in the spectrum pro-
vides a signature by which the trap-induced resonance
could be experimentally observed for a lattice with Lamb-
Dicke parameter η = 0.25 using Ramsey interferometry
to probe the collisional phase shift.

The TIR provides a new method for tuning interactions
between ultracold atoms, with applications to quantum
degenerate gases, molecular control, and quantum logic.
For example, by adiabatically tuning through the TIR to
zero separation between neighboring traps, atoms in the
ﬁrst vibrational state are mapped onto the highest molec-
ular bound state. In principle, one can induce coherent
superpositions of atomic and molecular states to control
new states of matter. The existence of trap-molecule
couplings opens avenues for new protocols in quantum
control.

An important practical consideration, not treated here,
is the eﬀect of ﬁnite temperature. As the TIR is explic-
itly tied to the vibrational state in the trap, the scattering
phase shift can be sensitive to motional heating. As seen
in Fig. 1(c), avoided crossings with the molecular bound
state occur for all vibrational trap states associated with
zero transverse excitation. For large scattering lengths,
considered here, the size of the coupling is not very sen-
sitive to the localization of atoms in the trap and thus
a common phase shift should be seen for atoms with ei-
ther zero or one quantum of longitudinal vibration. This
should make the TIR fairly robust as long as the trans-
verse excitation is suppressed. An additional consider-
ation is the eﬀect of spin-dependent trapping.
In our
multichannel scattering calculation, we ignored the spin
dependent light shift forces that occur in polarization
gradient optical lattices. Such forces can close certain
channels and provide new mechanisms for robust encod-
ings of quantum logic, immune to spin-ﬂips that would
otherwise occur in free space. These considerations will
be studied in future research.

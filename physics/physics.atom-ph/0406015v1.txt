We investigate relativistic and quantum electrodynamic eﬀects for highly-excited bound states
in hydrogenlike systems (Rydberg states). In particular, hydrogenic one-loop Bethe logarithms are
calculated for all circular states (l = n − 1) in the range 20 ≤ n ≤ 60 and successfully compared
to an existing asymptotic expansion for large principal quantum number n. We provide accurate
expansions of the Bethe logarithm for large values of n, for S, P and circular Rydberg states. These
three expansions are expected to give any Bethe logarithms for principal quantum number n > 20 to
an accuracy of ﬁve to seven decimal digits, within the speciﬁed manifolds of atomic states. Within
the numerical accuracy, the results constitute uniﬁed, general formulas for quantum electrodynamic
corrections whose validity is not restricted to a single atomic state. The results are relevant for
accurate predictions of radiative shifts of Rydberg states and for the description of the recently
investigated laser-dressed Lamb shift, which is observable in a strong coherent-wave light ﬁeld.

INTRODUCTION

Circular Rydberg states (n − 1 = l = |m|) have attracted attention in the past two decades, in part because
the transitions among these states are resonant with typical modes of microwave cavities. A convenient mechanism
for the preparation of these states has been described in [1, 2, 3]. When coupled to the modes of a microwave
cavity, the metastable Rydberg atoms undergo Rabi oscillations, leading to a direct veriﬁcation of the concept of ﬁeld
quantization [4]. The coupling of the resonant cavity to the Rydberg atom can be used for the generation of entangled
Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen pairs of atoms [5]. A further ﬁeld of interest has been the theoretical simulation of atomic
non-dispersive wave packets, which can be realized with the “assistance” of a background laser ﬁeld with a speciﬁc
“Kepler” frequency (see, e.g., [6, 7, 8]).

This partial list of applications is supplemented here by an investigation of relativistic and radiative eﬀects in highly-
excited hydrogenic states, without any consideration of the additional interaction with a cavity. The electron density
of circular Rydberg states (n − 1 = l = |m|) resembles Kepler circular orbits (see Fig. 1). However, the characteristic
shape of wave function is restricted to the maximum-|m| subcomponent (see also Fig. 1). For states with nonmaximal
|m| < l, the shape of the electron density is manifestly diﬀerent. For all circular Rydberg states, the wave function is
spread out considerably in comparison to lower states, on a length scale of hri ∼ const. × n2 aBohr (see Ref. [9]), where
r is the radial coordinate, aBohr is the Bohr radius and n is the (high) principal quantum number. Relativistic and
radiative eﬀects in Rydberg atoms allow for a simultaneous perspective on four diﬀerent physical regimes: relativistic
and QED radiative eﬀects in the transition in the borderline region between classical and quantum physics.

In addition to the aforementioned reasons for studying Rydberg atoms, the current paper is also inspired by a
recently completed analysis of radiative corrections for laser-dressed states [10, 11, 12]. In [10, 12], an experimental
setup based on the hydrogen 1S–2Pj (j = 1/2, 3/2) transition is discussed in detail. A coherent-wave light source with
the appropriate frequency has recently become available [13]. Because the 1S ground state is fully stable against
radiative (spontaneous) decay, the incoherent atomic ﬂuorescence (in the case of the 1S–2Pj transition) is described
to excellent accuracy by the Mollow spectrum [14]. A further promising setup for studying the laser-dressed Lamb
shift would be provided by a transition from the metastable 2S state to a high-n (Rydberg) P state. Rydberg
states have a small radiative decay width, which would facilitate the observation of the predicted dynamic corrections
to the Lamb shift [10, 15]. Furthermore, the frequency required for the excitation process 2S ⇔ nPj (high n) is
smaller and therefore a priori less problematic to realize experimentally than the 1S–2Pj transition. In the formalism
of [10, 11, 12], the self-energy correction analyzed here contributes to the Lamb shift of “bare” atomic levels; this
contribution is an essential part of the laser-dressed Lamb shift, which may be observed in incoherent light scattering
by hydrogenlike atoms.

Another motivation for the current work is to ﬁnd actual values of the Bethe logarithms for highly-excited states,
since the Bethe logarithm gives a signiﬁcant contribution to radiative level shifts. This is true of hydrogenlike, as
well as heliumlike [16, 17, 18] and lithiumlike [19] systems. One of the most extensive systematic studies [20] of
hydrogenic (one-loop) Bethe logarithms currently available in the literature extends only up to n = 20, and only
approximate values are available for higher excited circular Rydberg states [23]. Furthermore, it is of interest to study

numbers n = 10 and l = 9, but diﬀerent magnetic quantum numbers. Figure (a) displays the density of the states with
|m| = 9, in the plane of constant polar angle θ = π/2. In space, the probability density of the electron in this maximum-|m|
state describes a circular shape, which is why circular states are being viewed as analogues of classical planetary motion in
the quantum domain. However, this characteristic circular pattern is restricted to the extremal magnetic quantum numbers
(|m| = l). Figure (b) shows the radial probability density of the state with m = 0, in the plane of constant azimuth φ = 0.
The two maxima in the probability density are in the direction of the polar angles θ = 0 and θ = π.

the asymptotics of quantum electrodynamic corrections as a function of the quantum numbers. Such results can
for instance be useful in comparing diﬀerent calculational approaches to these corrections, and for obtaining general
expressions valid for arbitrary quantum numbers within a speciﬁc manifold of states. Certain asymptotic structures
have recently been conjectured for radiative corrections [21, 22, 23].

Furthermore, the analysis of highly-excited (bare) atomic states is motivated by recent experiments: e.g., in [24],
the evaluation of self energies of circular states of orbital quantum number l ≃ 30 was required. The consideration
of quantum electrodynamic corrections for highly-excited states is also relevant, in part, to the analysis of quantum
electrodynamic corrections to dielectronic recombination resonances [25].

In this work, we thus study radiative corrections for highly excited hydrogenic states. Speciﬁcally, after recalling
basic facts about relativistic corrections in Sec. II A, we proceed to the study of radiative eﬀects in Secs. II B and II C,
with an emphasis on the radiative decay width of circular states in Sec. II C. The main part of the investigation
reported here is contained in II D, where a numerical calculation of Bethe logarithms for highly and very highly
excited circular states is described (see Table I below). This investigation then leads to the asymptotic formulas for
Bethe logarithms which yield a relative accuracy of 10−5 or better, for general states within a speciﬁed manifold.
The self-energy corrections studied in Sec. II D are the by far dominant radiative corrections for circular Rydberg
states. Conclusions are drawn in Sec. III. This paper follows the usual convention for hydrogenic quantum numbers:
the principal quantum number is denoted by n, the orbital angular momentum by l and the total electron angular
momentum by j. As is customary in the literature, Z denotes the nuclear charge number of the hydrogenlike ion
under consideration, and α is the ﬁne-structure constant. Natural units (~ = c = ǫ0 = 1) are used throughout the
text.

II. RELATIVISTIC AND RADIATIVE EFFECTS

A. Relativistic corrections

We brieﬂy recall some basic facts about relativistic corrections to highly-excited states in hydrogenlike systems.
The numerical values of the coeﬃcients multiplying the relativistic corrections of order (Zα)4mc2 are typically small
for high-n states. In order to illustrate this point, we brieﬂy recall the expansion of the Dirac bound-state energy in
a hydrogenlike system in powers of Zα up to order (Zα)4 (see, e.g., [26, Eq. (2-87)]):

Enj = m −

(Zα)2 m

(Zα)4 m
n3

2j + 1

(cid:20)

−

3
8n (cid:21)

+ O(Zα)6 .

(1)

The (Zα)4-term is the dominant relativistic correction for low-Z hydrogenlike systems and is responsible, in particular,
for the ﬁne structure. By inspection of Eq. (1), we infer that for circular states (which have j = n − 1 ± 1/2), the

(Zα)4-term scales as j−4 ∼ n−4, which contrasts with the familiar n−3-scaling valid for ﬁxed j. As we will see below,
radiative corrections in Rydberg states also tend to display faster asymptotic behaviors (in n) than states with a ﬁxed
angular momentum.

B. Self Energy and Radiative Lifetime

In this article, we study radiative eﬀects in highly-excited hydrogenic energy levels. Our focus is on the self-energy
and the radiative lifetime. As pointed out in Ref. [27], the self-energy and the radiative lifetime are intimately related
to each other. Namely, the radiative lifetime of a hydrogenic state is proportional to the imaginary part of the
expectation value of that state hψ|Σren|ψi, where Σren is the renormalized self-energy operator discussed in Ch. 7
of [26], and ψ is the relativistic (Dirac) wave function. The self-energy is just the real part of hψ|Σren|ψi and leads to
the familiar shift of the energy levels.

As is well known, the real part of the one-loop self-energy shift ∆ESE may be written as

∆ESE = Rehψ|Σren|ψi =

F (nlj, Zα) .

α
π

(Zα)4 m
n3

Here, F (nlj, Zα) is a dimensionless quantity, and the the notation nlj follows the usual spectroscopic characterization
of the hydrogenic state ψ. It is customary in the literature to suppress the dependence of F on the quantum numbers
n, j and l and write F (Zα) for F (nlj, Zα).

The decay width Γ is the reciprocal of the lifetime τ and is given by

Γ =

= −2 Im hψ|Σren|ψi .

1
τ

For states with the same angular momentum quantum numbers, the decay rate decreases with n approximately as
n−3, and the lifetime correspondingly goes as n3 (see Ref. [9]). This is also manifest in the deﬁnition (2) of the scaled
self-energy function F (nlj, Zα), the structure of which reﬂects the usual, familiar scaling of the eﬀect with n (for ﬁxed
l and j).

C. Radiative Lifetime: Asymptotics for Rydberg States

To a good approximation, the lifetime of a highly-excited hydrogenic state does not depend on the spin of the
electron, and it is only the principal quantum number and the orbital angular momentum which enter into the
leading-order (nonrelativistic) expression for the decay rate of excited hydrogenic states.

We denote the (leading-order) decay width of a state with principal quantum number n and orbital angular mo-
mentum l by the symbol Γ(n, l). Here, we are particularly interested in states with n = l + 1, and our goal is to study
the dependence of the lifetime on the bound-state quantum numbers. For the manifold of states with n = l + 1, based
on the formalism introduced in [27], we obtain the following general expression,

Γ(n, n − 1) =

(4b)

The asymptotic expansion (4b) about large n works surprisingly well, even at low principal quantum number. For
n = 2, the ﬁrst few terms listed in (4b) reproduce the exact formula (4a) to within 5 % accuracy. For n = 40, the
diﬀerence is less than 10−10 in relative units. Equation (4b) implies that the lifetime of circular Rydberg states with
l = n − 1 scales eﬀectively as n5, in contrast to the familiar n3-scaling which is valid for ﬁxed l, but varying n.

Based on the well-behaved asymptotic structure of the leading non-relativistic contribution to Imhψ|Σren|ψi for

high quantum numbers, we now turn our attention to the real part Rehψ|Σren|ψi.

Vacuum-polarization eﬀects are negligible for high-l circular Rydberg states [the radial component of the wave
function scales as (Zαmr)l for small r]. The dominant radiative correction to hydrogenic energy levels is given by the
(one-photon) self energy

D. Self–Energy

,

which is a process in which the bound electron (double line) emits and re-absorbs a photon (wavy line); this eﬀect
shifts the energies predicted by the Dirac equation.

We now turn to the investigation of the energy shift ∆ESE, which is deﬁned in Eq. (2) and corresponds to the
above diagram. The semi-analytic expansion of F (nlj, Zα) about Zα = 0 for a general atomic state with quantum
numbers n, l and j gives rise to the expression [28]

F (nlj, Zα) = A41(nlj) ln[(Zα)

−2] + A40(nlj) + O(Zα) .

(5)

The Zα-expansion is semi-analytic, i.e., it involves powers of Zα and of ln[(Zα)−2]. The A coeﬃcients have two
indices, the ﬁrst of which denotes the power of Zα [including those powers contained in Eq. (2)], while the second
index denotes the power of the logarithm ln[(Zα)−2].

FIG. 2:
(color online.) Relative diﬀerence between the Bethe logarithm values presented in Tab. I and the asymptotic
formula (9), for circular Rydberg states (l = n − 1) in the range 20 < n ≤ 60. Since zero is contained in all the error bars,
the Bethe logarithms in Tab. I are fully consistent with the approximation (9). The error bars in the ﬁgure correspond to the
uncertainty in the numerical coeﬃcients of Eq. (9).

The coeﬃcient A41(nlj) assumes a value of 4/3 for S states and vanishes for all non-S states. The general formula

for A40 reads (see, e.g., [29, 30])

where κ = 2 (l −j) (j +1/2). The Bethe logarithm ln k0(n, l) is an inherently nonrelativistic quantity, whose expression

Here, HS is the nonrelativistic Coulomb Schr¨odinger Hamiltonian, pi is the ith Cartesian component of the momentum
operator, En and φ are respectively the (nonrelativistic) energy and the wave-function of a state with the quantum
numbers (n, l), and the summation over Cartesian coordinates (i = 1, 2, 3) is implicit.

Bethe logarithms have been studied for all hydrogenic states with n ≤ 20, by various authors and with increasing
accuracy due to advances in the algorithms used and in the computing technology available [20, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
37, 38]. While the calculational diﬃculties (numerical convergence properties of the involved hypergeometric functions)
increase as the principal quantum number increases, the evaluation of the hydrogenic nonrelativistic Bethe logarithm
can be regarded as an easy computational task from the perspective of our current understanding of bound states, and
of modern computer technology. In the current work, we employ the technique previously discussed in [23, 39], where
the relevant matrix element of the hydrogenic wavefunction [41] is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions 2F1,
which are then suitably integrated. For high energies of the virtual photon, we found it useful to employ the combined
nonlinear-condensation transformation [40, 42] in order to accelerate the convergence of the series representation of
these hypergeometric functions.

One of the results we have obtained reads

ln k0(n = 20, l = 19) = −0.000 008 084 977 837 087 891(1) ,

(8)

a value which conﬁrms the result obtained previously in Ref. [20] for this state. The error is due to the uncertainty in
the ﬁnal integration over the virtual photon energy. While the numerical accuracy of this result is merely of academic
interest, we found it useful to verify the accuracy of our computational method against the basis-set techniques
employed in [20, 38].

TABLE I: Values of the Bethe logarithm for circular Rydberg states (for which
l = n − 1), in the range 20 < n ≤ 60. According to Eqs. (5) and (6), the Bethe
logarithm ln k0 contributes signiﬁcantly to the radiative correction to the energy of
hydrogenic states. All explicit results found here agree with a previously published
expansion [23, Eq. (37)], as well as with the new asymptotic expansion (9), as is
shown in Fig. 2 (within the numerical uncertainties in the asymptotic coeﬃcients).

In Tab. I, we present accurate numerical values for the Bethe logarithm (7) of circular Rydberg states, for 21 ≤
n ≤ 60. These values are in agreement with the truncated asymptotic expansion found in Ref. [23, Eq. (37)]. This
asymptotic expansion had been derived on the basis of numerical data reported in Ref. [20], where the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 20
had been covered. Based on the numerical data of Tab. I, which cover a wider range of principal quantum numbers
as compared to Ref. [20], we obtain the following improved asymptotics for the Bethe logarithm of circular Rydberg
states:

where terms of order l−k with k ≥ 6 are neglected. The algorithm described in the Appendix of [23] was used
for obtaining the coeﬃcients of this asymptotic expansion. All the coeﬃcients in (9) separately are in very good
agreement with those found previously [23, Eq. (37)]. The Bethe logarithm values in Tab. I are fully consistent with
the above truncated expansion: they fall inside the error bars of (9), as is illustrated in Fig. 2. Furthermore, the
“expectation” values for the coeﬃcients of formula (9) correctly “predict” about seven digits of the actual numerical
value of the Bethe logarithm in Tab. I, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Based on the very good consistency of the asymptotic
expansion with the actual numerical data (Fig. 2), we conjecture that the “expectation” values of the expansion (9)
give the Bethe logarithm of all circular Rydberg states with n > 20 with a relative precision better than 10−6, as can
be expected from Fig. 2. Furthermore, we would like to conjecture here that the expansion (9) not only represents a
“polynomial ﬁt” to the numerical data, but that it represents the true asymptotic expansion of the Bethe logarithm
for high quantum numbers.

For S states, based on data available for principal quantum numbers n ≤ 20 (see Ref. [20]), we obtain the following

asymptotic expansion as a function of the principal quantum number n,

ln k0(n, l = 0) ≃ 2.72265434(5) +

expansion (10), with the “expectation” values employed for the coeﬃcients, to give the Bethe logarithm of all S states
with n > 10 to better than 2 · 10−7 in relative units.

Finally, for high-n P states, we obtain

III. CONCLUSIONS

We have studied relativistic and radiative corrections for highly-excited hydrogenic states. In addition to S and
P states, we have concentrated on circular Rydberg states (for which l = n − 1). We have observed on the relativistic
and radiative corrections considered here that circular Rydberg state corrections have a faster asymptotic behavior
(as a function of n) than states with a ﬁxed angular momentum.

The following scaling properties hold for the dominant relativistic and radiative eﬀects on circular hydrogenic
Rydberg states: (i) The leading relativistic corrections to the energy levels (of order (Zα)4mc2) scale as n−4. (ii)
Radiative decay rates scale as n−5 [see Eq. (4b)]. (iii) The Bethe logarithm contribution to the self-energy shift (2)
scales as n−6. Note the three inverse powers of l in Eq. (9) which have to be taken into consideration in addition to
the three inverse powers of n originating from (2). By contrast, the Bethe logarithm contribution for highly-excited
S and P states scales as n−3 [see Eqs. (10) and (11)]. (iv) The anomalous magnetic moment contribution to the
2κ(2l+1) in Eq. (6)] scales as n−5 for circular Rydberg states and thus
Lamb shift [which corresponds to the term − 1
dominates over the Bethe logarithm in the limit of large l = n − 1.

In this article, we also provide an exact result for the decay rate of highly-excited hydrogenic Rydberg states [see
Eq. (4a)]. Furthermore, we obtain accurate values (see Tab. I) for the Bethe logarithms of circular Rydberg states (for
which the orbital angular quantum number l is related to the principal quantum number as l = n − 1). These values
are in a range of quantum numbers 21 ≤ n ≤ 60, where no such data have been available up to now, to the best of our
knowledge. These results conﬁrm that the dependence of radiative corrections on the bound-state quantum numbers
can be represented, to a very good accuracy, by asymptotic expansions about large n which involve negative integer
powers [see Eqs. (4b), (9), (10) and (11)]. This functional dependence has recently been observed for a number of
QED eﬀects [21, 22, 23]. We conjecture here that the Bethe logarithm expansions (9), (10) and (11) represent the
true asymptotic expansions about large quantum numbers (to the precision indicated in the text).

The results obtained here are relevant for any analysis (e.g., [24]) where the evaluation of the self energy of circular
(n = l + 1) states of orbital quantum number l > 20 is required. They are also relevant for the description of the
“bare” Lamb shift contribution to the Lamb shift of laser-dressed states [10, 11, 12, 14] in experiments with Rydberg
states. A possible experimental setup would involve the metastable 2S state and an excitation to a high-n P state.
The required frequency is smaller than the one required for the excitation 1S ⇔ 2Pj, which has been studied in
detail in [12]. Moreover, both states involved in the transition 2S ⇔ nPj (high n) have a long lifetime, which would
facilitate the observation of the dressed-state corrections to the Lamb shift [10, 11, 12]. The formalism required for

7

the analysis of further corrections to the laser-dressed Lamb shift has recently been described in [12]. The additional
corrections are due to ionization, counter-rotating terms (Bloch–Siegert shifts, see [43]) and nonresonant levels, as
well as laser-ﬁeld conﬁguration dependent eﬀects.

Finally, we note that an accurate investigation of the Lamb shift of the (numerous) diﬀerent magnetic subcom-
ponents of circular Rydberg levels would allow for a sensitive test of the recently proposed, somewhat speculative
“polarized Lamb shift” (see Ref. [44]) that predicts a breaking of the rotational symmetry imposed on quantum
electrodynamics.

[15] By contrast, direct transitions among Rydberg states are probably not a suitable environment for the study of the dressed
Lamb shift in an intense laser ﬁeld: the problem is that a laser which drives a circular Rydberg transition between levels
with n, l ⇔ n + 1, l + 1 is approximately resonant not only with the desired transitions, but also with the transition
n + 1, l + 1 ⇔ n + 2, l + 2, in the limit of large n. Therefore, the level scheme used in the analysis of the laser-dressed Lamb
shift would have to be substantially generalized in order to accomodate for the many (near-resonant) energy levels.

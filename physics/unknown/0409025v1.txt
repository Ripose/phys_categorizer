Abstract 

Particle  accelerations  by  a  1D,  EM,  dispersive  pulse  in  an  external  magnetic  field  are 

investigated. It is found that the well-known cyclotron resonance may be classified into three 

regimes  as  the  length  and/or  the  amplitude  of  the  pulse  are  varied.  Namely,  as  the  pulse 

amplitude increases, the transit-time cyclotron-resonance acceleration [CRA] evolves to phase 

trapping, and reflect particles. The amplitude and wave dispersion as well as the pulse length 

strongly  affect  those  accelerations.  The  interesting  phenomena  of  quantization  of  resonance 

velocities in between the two regimes are also investigated. This new mechanism may lead to 

wave amplification at some discrete frequencies other than the cyclotron frequency.

1. Introduction 

Accelerations of charged particles by a sinusoidal EM wave have been studied extensively 
in the past.1 Here, particle accelerations by a 1D, EM, dispersive wave packet in a magnetic 

field mainly through the cyclotron resonance are investigated. It is assumed that the pulse has 

a  Gaussian  profile  with  the  following  generalized  linearly  polarized  electric  field  (and  its 

self-consistent magnetic field) directed perpendicular to the z-axis along which it propagates:

position, the central group-velocity, the time, and a measure of the pulse-length, respectively,

of the carrier wave. This kind of EM pulse may approximate a part of a parallel shock wave 

located upstream from the  earth’s bow shock and/or the recently found  EM  solitons  formed 

during laser fusion experiments. In the linear regime of the cyclotron resonance acceleration 

the velocity gain is relatively small, and the beam-like particles with only longitudinal initial

2.1 Linear Cyclotron-Resonance 

          We start with the linear case, which corresponds to the solution (1) above. Fig.1 depicts 

among  others  velocity  shifts  of  electrons  well  after  penetrating  an  EM  wave  packet  with

2.2 Weakly Nonlinear Cyclotron-Resonance 

          Fig.1 shows final velocity shifts of electrons after interactions with a linear- to weakly 

nonlinear  wave  packets  with  En=0.001-0.01.  As  the  amplitude  is  increased,  the  numerical 

results,  which  show  much  broader  acceleration  region  as  well  as  multi-peaks,  gradually 

deviate  from  the  linear  theory  (1).  The  most  outstanding  nonlinear  effect  is  the 

bifurcation/quantization of the linear cyclotron resonance peak, which occurs when En=0.07

  or  greater.  When  En=0.01  the 

strongest acceleration occurs at v0= -0.02c, while that in the linear regime occurs at v0 ≈ 0. 

A similar trend is also observable in Fig.2, in which En is further increased from 0.02 

to 0.04. However, in this case, the increase in the amplitude tends to broaden the resonances 

rather  than  increasing  the  number  of  resonances.  When  En=0.04  the  velocity  profile  is 
reminiscent of the phase trapping2 that occurs in the strongly nonlinear regime. Since in all of 

these  cases  the  perpendicular  velocity  shifts  are  greater  than 

v p −

0v

=0.1c,  some  particles 

may  be  reflected  by  the  pulse,  and  consequently  the  final  parallel  velocity  of  the  reflected 

particles may reach 0.2c. Namely, particle reflections are a sign of strongly nonlinear regime 

of the CRA. In such a regime the effects of the wave potential becomes dominant. It is found 

also that even with the linear amplitude, as the pulse is elongated, the number of resonance 

peaks  increases,  and  the  band  structure  becomes  more  evident.  Fig.3  shows  that  when  the 

pulse with En=0.01 and ln=5, which result in two resonance peaks in Fig.1, is elongated to as 

long as ln=5 and 10 the number of resonance increases to 4 and 7, respectively. What is more, 

even  at  a  low  amplitude,  if  the  pulse  length  is  made  longer  such  that  the  condition

  is satisfied, the penetrating particles experience the weakly nonlinear CRA rather 

than  the  transit-time  CRA,  as  demonstrated  in  Fig.4.  Namely,  the  nonlinearity  of  a  pulse  is 
t ∆ω   rather than its amplitude. 

determined by the parameter

2.3 Nonlinear pulse amplification 

Finally,  Fig.5  depicts  the  accelerations  of  electrons  initially  with  vo=0.2c  by  pulses 

with different amplitudes. When the pulse amplitude is small the acceleration occurs near the 

cyclotron  frequency.  As  in  this  case,  accelerated  electrons  lose  energies,  the  flow  of  energy 

being reversed from the electrons to the pulse. Therefore, the components of the pulse and/or 

  tend to grow. However, when the pulse amplitude is higher, the modes at 

eΩ≈ω
  may grow, amplifying the pulse. Therefore, this computation shows that when a 

noise with 
eΩ≈ 2.1ω
series of pulses are produced and grow to sufficiently large amplitudes via a type of cyclotron 

resonance instability, the frequency of the unstable modes will shift to separate ones. 

 

 

3. Conclusions     

As  the  pulse  amplitude  increases,  the  cyclotron  resonance  bifurcates,  showing 

multi-resonance  peaks.  The  reason  for  the  bifurcation  of  resonance  is  that  the  accelerated 

particles  experience  trapping,  and  the  resultant  velocity  modulation  may  resonate  with  the 

finite length of the pulses. It was also demonstrated  that  by  the  same  resonance  mechanism

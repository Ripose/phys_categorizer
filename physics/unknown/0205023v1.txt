Abstract

Channeling  of  particle  beam  in  straight  and  bent  single-wall  nanotubes  has  been  studied  in  computer
simulations. We have found that the nanotubes should be sufficiently narrow in order to steer efficiently
the  particle  beams,  with  preferred  diameter  in  the  order  of  0.5-2  nm.  Wider  nanotubes,  e.g.  10-50  nm,
appear  rather  useless  for  channeling  purpose  because  of  high  sensitivity  of  channeling  to  nanotube
curvature. We have compared bent nanotubes with bent crystals as elements of beam steering technique,
and found that narrow nanotubes have an efficiency of beam bending similar to that of crystals.

Introduction
Bent  crystals  have  been  efficiently  used  for  channeling  of  particle  beams  at  accelerators  [1]  in  the  energy  range
spanning six decades, from 3 MeV [2] to 900 GeV [3]. Currently, bent crystals are largely used for extraction of  70-
GeV  protons at IHEP (Protvino) with efficiency reaching 85% at intensity well over 1012 particle per second, steered
by silicon crystal of just 2 mm in length [4]. A bent crystal (5 mm Si) is installed into Yellow ring of the Relativistic
Heavy  Ion  Collider  where  it  channels  Au  ions  and  polarised  protons  of  100-250  GeV/u  as  a  part  of  the  collimation
system [5].

Since 1991 [6], here has been a lot of study on carbon nanotubes to understand their formation and properties. Carbon
nanotubes  stick  out  in  the  field  of  nanostructures,  owing  to  their  exceptional  mechanical,  capillarity,  electronic
transport  and  superconducting  properties  [7-9].  They  are  cylindrical  molecules  with  a  diameter  of  order  1  nm  and  a
length of many microns [10]. They are made of carbon atoms and can be thought of as a graphene sheet rolled around a
cylinder [11]. Creating efficient channeling structures - from single crystals to epitaxial layers [2] to nanotubes  - might
have a significant effect onto the accelerator world. It is well known that nanotubes can be manufactured of different
diameter - from a fraction of nm up to microns, of different length - from tens of microns up to millimeters, of different
material - usually carbon but also others [12]. This makes nanotubes a very interesting object for channeling research.

It has been shown in refs. [13-15] that  in a carbon nanotube the channeled particles are confined in a potential well
U(ρ,ϕ) with the depth U0 of about 60 eV. The critical angle for channeling is then  θc=(2U0/pv) 1/2.  In a nanotube bent
with  radius  R,  similarly  to  bent  crystals  [1],  an  effective  potential  taking  into  account  a  centrifugal  term  pvx/R  is
introduced [15]:  Ueff(ρ,ϕ)= U(ρ,ϕ)+ pvx/R, where x=r cos(ϕ) is the coordinate in the direction of bending, pv  is  the
particle momentum times velocity. As shown in [15],  a carbon nanotube of  1.4 nm diameter has a significant effective
potential  well  Ueff    even  for  bendings  equivalent  to  ≅300  Tesla  or  pv/R≥  1  GeV/cm,  i.e.  bent  nanotubes  can  be
comparable to (110) and (111) channels in silicon crystal commonly used in crystal channeling applications.

The present work is devoted to Monte Carlo simulation of particle channeling in bent single-wall nanotubes, aimed at
finding how useful are the nanotubes for channeling of positively-charged particle beams, what kind of nanotubes are
efficient for this job, and how nanotubes compare with crystals in this regard.

Two  mechanisms  of  particle  transfer  from  channeled  to  random  states  are  well  known  for  crystals:  scattering  on
electrons and nuclei and curvature of the channel [1]. Typical nanotube is on the order of 0.1 mm in length at present.
For such a short channel, the scattering on electrons within the bulk of the tube is quite small. However, a curvature of
the tube could quickly (in less than one oscillation) bring much of the channeled particles out of the potential well or

Simulation model

In order to assess the general properties of channeling in nanotubes, we average the potential U(ρ,ϕ, z)    of  a  straight
nanotube over the longitudinal coordinate z and angleϕ to obtain a potential U(ρ) with cylinder symmetry.
As known from crystal channeling, the averaging over z is well justified as a collision of a particle with a nanotube wall
under  a  glancing  angle  does  involve  many  thousand  atoms  along  the  particle  trajectory.  For  the  same  reason,  the
averaging over ϕ is equally justified if the nanotube has arbitrary helicity [15] as defined by nanotube indices (m, n). In
the  special  cases  of  zigzag  (m=0)  or  armchair  (m=n)  nanotubes,  the  wall  consists  of  atomic  rows  parallel  to  the
nanotube axis; the nanotube potential is then defined by the sum of potentials of the rows. However, even in these cases
the averaged potential U(ρ) is significantly different from U(ρ,ϕ) only in rather close vicinity from the wall, ≤0.1 nm
[14,15],  where  scattering  on  the  wall  nuclei  is  also  important.  Further  on  in  the  paper  we  apply  only  the  averaged
potential U(ρ)for a straight nanotube.

We use so-called standard potential introduced by Lindhard [16]. When averaged over (ϕ, z), it is described by [13]:

Here  Z1 e ,  Z2  e  are  the  charges  of  the  incident  particle  and  the  nanotube  nuclei  respectively,  N  is  the  number  of
elementary periods along the tube perimeter, a=0.142 nm is the carbon bond length; dimensionless parameters are

the nanotube radius is

The screening distance aS is related to the Bohr radius aB  by

In a tube bent along the x direction, the motion of a particle is described by the equations

where ρ2=x2+y2. This takes into account only the nanotube potential and the centrifugal potential. Any particle within
close distance, order of aS,  from  the  wall  (where  density  of  the  nuclei  is  significant)  is  also  strongly  affected  by  the
nuclear scattering.

Optimisation of nanotube

We did look in simulations how channeled particles survive in nanotubes of different curvatures and diameters.
Figure 1 shows three examples of trajectories for 1-GeV protons channeled in carbon nanotubes of 1.1, 2.2, and 4.4 nm
diameter, bent with the same curvature radius 1 cm. The range of transverse coordinate x where channeled particles are
localised in the tube is about 0.5 nm in each of the three cases. Taking into account different diameters of the tubes,
these  examples  suggest  that  whereas  the  narrow  tube  is  mostly  filled  with  channeled  particles,  the  wider  tubes  are
nearly empty. The centrifugal force kills channeling in most of the wide-tube cross-section where there is no field to
guide the particles.

To  make  a  nanotube  an  efficient  channeling  structure,  we  must  optimise  the  nanotube  diameter  with  respect  to  the
curvature of the nanotube. It is rather easy to understand the match between the diameter and the curvature. In the time

the bent tube should not change by more than the critical angle θc, otherwise — if particle comes to the wall with an
angle greater than θc — it will cross the wall and become dechanneled.

Figure 2 gives another simple explanation. The top of the figure shows the potential well  U(ρ)  for tubes of different
diameter d; the depth U0  of each well is the same. The bottom of the figure illustrates the effective potential Ueff(x)=
U(x)+ pvx/R of the same tubes bent with radius R for particles of momentum p. Only minor part of the wide well Ueff
can confine the channeled particles. If the change in the centrifugal potential pv/R over the tube diameter d  is  much
greater than U0, certainly the tube is inefficient. So a rough estimate for the optimal diameter dopt will come from the
relation (pv/R)d ≈ U0, that is

We can rewrite it using an equivalent magnetic field Heq corresponding to pv/R  ratio:

 dopt≈ R(U0 /pv).

dopt≈ 1.8 nm ⋅ (100 Tesla /Heq)

and substituting U0  ≈ 60 eV  for the carbon nanotube. The typical range for Heq  as used in bent crystal channeling is
30-300 Tesla (the respective range of  pv/R is 0.1-1.0 GeV/cm), and can be as much as ≈ 1000 Tesla with silicon (and
2-3 times higher with Ge and W). For nanotubes working in the same Heq range, 30-300 Tesla, the diameter should be
in the range 0.6-6 nm. The stronger field we want to use for beam steering, the thinner channel (nanotube) should be.
Interestingly, the range of 0.6-6 nm is just about the typical range of easily manufactured carbon nanotubes.

We also have to conclude that wider nanotubes, like ≈  60 nm, are good only for weak equivalent fields of ≈ 3  Tesla.
Any substantial curvature of a wide nanotube would destroy most of channeling in it. Therefore the interest to wide
channeling structures motivated by an expected lack of scattering inside them is quite limited now (if not canceled at
all) by considerations of bending dechanneling.

The equation for dopt can be written in general form for nanotubes of other material, with the use of Lindhard potential:

This short analysis suggests that, in order to compete with crystals at beam steering, the nanotube should be as narrow
as order of 1 nm.

Results of simulation

Following the above analysis, we have studied the efficiency of bent nanotube channeling in Monte Carlo simulations.
A parallel beam of 1 GeV protons was entering a carbon nanotube, where protons were tracked over 50 µm. Depending
on the nanotube diameter, curvature and starting coordinates, every proton did 5 to 20 oscillations over that distance,
typically. Multiple scattering was not included, so we did evaluate only the effects of bending dechanneling. Figure 3
shows an example of the angular distribution of particles downstream of the 50-µm long nanotube of 1.1 nm diameter,
bent 4 mrad, shown in the direction of bending. Similarly to pictures of bent crystal channeling, there is clear separation
of channeled and nonchanneled peaks, with some particles lost (dechanneled along the tube) between them.

We did such a simulation for variety of nanotubes with different characteristics. Figure 4 shows the number of protons
channeled through 50 µm as a function of the nanotube curvature pv/R for tubes of different diameter. For comparison,
also shown is the same function for Si(110) crystal (from ref.[1]).

The channel length of 50 µm, with bending of 1 GeV/cm, gives the 1-GeV protons a deflection of 5 mrad - sufficient
for many accelerator applications like extraction [1,3-5]. One can see from Fig.4 that nanotubes as narrow as 1 nm are
comparable to silicon crystals in beam bending. However, nanotubes of ≥2 nm diameter already show poor behaviour
in  channeling  for  significant  bending.  The  wider  nanotube  is,  the  weaker  channeling  properties  it  demonstrates,  in
agreement with the discussion of previous section.

Summary

As shown in computer simulations, nanotubes can channel particle beams with efficiency similar to that of crystal
channeling. Bending dechanneling, present if nanotube has a curvature, is found to be a very significant factor in

nanotube channeling. It sets the nanotube diameter optimal for channeling to be in the range of about 0.5-2 nm. Much
wider nanotubes are of little use for channeling purpose because of high sensitivity of channeling to curvature. Narrow
nanotubes, with diameter on the order of 1 nm, can be a basis for an efficient technique of beam steering at particle
accelerators.

This paper addresses two seemingly unrelated problems, (a) What is the entropy 

and energy accounting in the Maxwell Demon problem? and (b) How can the 

efficiency of markets be measured? Here we show, in a simple model for the 

Maxwell Demon, the entropy of the universe increases by an amount 

η≈

0.8399955201358 bits/particle

 in going from a random state to an ordered 

state and by an amount 

*
η ≈

2.373138220832 bits/particle

 in going from one sorted 

state to another sorted state. We calculate the efficiency of an engine driven by the 

Maxwell sorting process. The efficiency depends only on the temperatures of the 

particles and of the computer the Demon uses to sort the particles.  We also show 

the approach is general and create a simple model of a stock market in which the 

Limit Trader plays the role of the Maxwell Demon. We use this model to define 

and measure market efficiency.  

 

Maxwell1 2 3 created his Demon in 1867 to help clarify the issues associated with 

the Second Law of Thermodynamics. In particular, Maxwell wished to address the 

question of the role of intelligence in the flow of entropy. The Demon was an intelligent 

microscopic creature that sat at a trapdoor separating a box into two sides. Particles 

inhabited both sides of the box. The Demon observed the particles and allowed fast 

particles to enter into one side of the box and slow particles to enter into the other side 

of the box. The entropy of the particles was thus decreased and a temperature gradient, 

capable of producing useful work, was created. The intelligent Demon seemed to violate

2 

the Second Law. Either the Second Law had to be abandoned or the entropy of the 

Demon had to increase to compensate for the decrease in entropy of the particles. 

Szilard4 was the first to note that there must be entropy associated with information. 

Shannon5 developed an entropy measure for information that mirrored the logarithmic 

entropy measure of Boltzmann in physics. Brillouin6 unsuccessfully tried to destroy the 

Demon by concentrating on the entropy of the measurement process. 

The problem of market efficiency is more modern. The Efficient Market 

Hypothesis7 (EMH) states that, at any given time, prices reflect all available information 

available about a particular stock and/or market.  According to EMH, no trader has an 

advantage in predicting the return of a stock since every trader has access to all 

information. Prices are commonly thought to follow a “random walk8.” The EMH 

comes in three flavours: 

Strong Efficiency – All information in the market, public or private, is accounted 

for in the stock price. Even insider knowledge cannot provide price predictability. 

Semi-Strong Efficiency – Public information is accounted for in the stock price, 

but not insider information. Neither analysis of the company fundamentals nor technical 

analysis of the history of the price/volumes can be used to predict prices. 

Weak Efficiency – All information in historical stock prices is reflected in 

today’s price. Technical analysis of the history cannot be used to predict future prices. 

There have been extensive measurements of market efficiencies9 10 with the 

typical conclusion that markets are efficient and prices are unpredictable, at least in the 

weak sense. Of course, markets cannot be efficient on all timescales. There is some 

small finite time in which information propagates through the market. The approach to 

efficiency on these small timescales has also been measured.11

We take a much different approach to understanding the information content of a 

market. Rather than price, we focus on the number of shares traded or offered for trade. 

This information is not independent of price information. Price and trade volume are 

related through liquidity or price impact.12 The number of shares traded, however, is 

more directly related to supply/demand and also to the probability measures of 

information theory. In particular, we use the theory developed in the solution of the 

Maxwell Demon Problem to develop a theory of an ideal stock market. When the 

behaviour of stocks in actual markets is compared with the behaviour of the idealized 

market we are led to the conclusion that the market does not appear to be a Poisson 

process throughout the day. In fact, for part of the trading day, the market appears to be 

responsive to the supply/demand for market orders.  

In the Maxwell Demon Problem we have an intelligent gnome that orders a box of 

particles so that hot particles are on one side of the box and cold particles are on the 

other. In a stock market we have two types of traders, Market Traders and Limit 

Traders. Market Traders place orders and take whatever price the market provides. In a 

market composed solely of Market Traders chaos would reign because no mechanism 

would exist for determining a price. Limit Traders are traders that place orders to be 

filled at a given price. The Limit Traders therefore establish a price in a market. They 

play the role that Maxwell’s Demon plays in ordering a box of particles. Limit Traders 

order the market and give meaning to concept of price. The arrival of market orders on 

the trading floor is analogous to the arrival of a particle at a trapdoor between the two 

sides of Maxwell’s box. The decision by the Demon to open the trapdoor for the particle 

or close it is analogous to the decision by the Limit Trader to go long or go short in 

Complexica Report 031115

anticipation of the market order. Although the two problems do not map exactly onto 

each other, the same excess entropy constants emerge in each problem. 

Our goal in addressing the Maxwell Demon question is to design a theoretical 

engine that generates useful work from the intelligent sorting of particles and to use that 

engine to account for energy and entropy flows, including flows into and out of any 

computer the Demon uses to help sort the particles. In order for the Second Law to hold 

in our idealized world, the engine must have efficiency less than one and the total 

entropy of the universe must increase as the engine runs. Fortunately, we find this to be 

the case. The efficiency of the engine is determined by the temperature of the particles 

and the temperature of the Demon’s computer. 

Our goal in the market problem is to develop a measure of the efficiency of 

information use in a market. We would then like to use this measure to calculate the 

efficiencies of trading of any particular stock. From a sociological point of view this 

provides a window into market behaviour. From a business point of view, this measure 

can be used to inform trading decisions.  

The Maxwell Demon 

Our version of the Maxwell Demon problem is illustrated in Figure 1. The 

Maxwell Demon observes the particles and writes the relevant information on the next 

particle to approach the barrier to an Input Tape. The Computer writes the appropriate 

control signals to an Output Tape, or Controller. The Controller then sends the 

appropriate signals to the barrier to open or close to allow the particle to pass or not to 

pass. The Computer and its Input/Output are immersed in a heat bath. We neglect any 

work or entropy generation associated with opening and closing the barrier, with 

measuring the state of the particles, and with any computation other than writing and 

erasing tapes. We do, however, take into account the work and entropy generation 

Complexica Report 031115 

5 

associated with writing and erasing tapes and entropy/work associated with the 

particles. 

Zurek pointed out13 that the total entropy, which he calls physical entropy, must 

include both the usual statistical entropy of the system as well as the entropy of the 

computer (including input and output tapes), which he calls algorithmic information. 

The algorithmic information is the most concise message which describes the system 

with the requisite accuracy.  

 

Figure 1:  The Maxwell Demon observes the particles and writes relevant 

information to an Input Tape that is immersed in a heat bath. The Input Tape is 

processed by the Computer also immersed in the heat bath. The Computer 

writes to an Output Tape, or Controller, that sends control signals to a barrier 

that allows particles to pass or not.

entropies. These entropies represent the irreversible entropy increase of the universe due 

to the sorting process.  

For each of these initial conditions the Demon collects an extra bit of information 

per particle approach that is not used in the control of the barrier. We call this unused 

information maintenance information.  

Up to this point the results are based on information theoretic arguments, 

independent of physics. Energy accounting allows us to tie the problem to physics.

7 

Once the particles are separated, the system of particles is available to do useful work. 

Therefore, we can create an engine that is driven by the “Intellectual Property” of the 

Maxwell Demon (Figure 2). The engine is coupled to a computer that has as its basic 

storage element a cylinder immersed in a heat bath of temperature 

 and composed of 

ST

a single particle and two pistons. The computational element is illustrated in Figure 3. 

The Demon writes the information he collects to an Input Tape composed of 

computation units like that illustrated in Figure 3. The Controller is also composed of 

the same computation units. 

 

Figure 2: The Bistro Drive. The engine experiences four phases, a sorting 

phase, a work phase, a mixing phase, and a heating phase. The sorting phase 

separates the hot particles from the cold particles and generates heat

equilibrium is attained. There is no heat transfer in this phase, although the gas 

cools. The piston is removed in the mixing phase allowing the particles to 

access the entire box. The gas temperature remains constant in this phase. 

Finally, the gas is reheated to its original temperature.

Tape is indicating that a slow particle is approaching from the right or a fast 

particle is approaching from the left. If the Input Tape is signalling for an open 

barrier then the o piston in the Controller Unit is in the middle of the container. A 

Unit that is erased has both pistons at the end of the container.

Engine, the efficiency depends on two temperatures. The lower temperature, however, 

is that of the heat bath surrounding the computer. 

Market Efficiency 

We now apply the results of the Maxwell Demon problem to a simple artificial 

stock market. This will allow us to define an idealized market that can be compared 

with real markets. We consider a very simple model for the stock market that includes a 

supply and demand of stock through short and long market orders and a single Limit 

Trader who fills all market orders. 

We imagine we have 

N

 market orders, some of which are unfilled long orders, 

some of which are unfilled short orders, and some of which are empty orders (a time 

period in which there is no market order placed).  As time progresses all unfilled orders 

become filled orders. Unfilled orders become filled by being paired with limit orders. 

We imagine a Limit Trader who is cognizant of the type of the next market order and 

who has placed a limit order in anticipation of the market order. The Limit Trader is a 

fully prescient inside trader. This idealized Limit Trader plays the role of the Maxwell 

Demon for the System. This trader drives the market to order in the same way that the 

Maxwell Demon drives the box of unsorted particles to order. The Limit Trader 

anticipates the market orders and places an ask (a), a bid (b), or no order (0) in 

anticipation of short (S), long (L), or already filled (F) orders.

10 

In the stock market model there are three states for the entities (S,L,F) rather than 

four, (AR, AL, BR, BL), in the Maxwell Demon model. There are three control actions 

(a,b,0) rather than two, closed or open barrier (c,o).  Finally, the Limit Trader does not 

seem to collect Maintenance Information, while the Maxwell Demon does. The excess 

entropy, however, in the stock market model is exactly the same as in the Maxwell 

Demon problem. In particular, the excess entropy in going from a state in which all 

market orders are unfilled to one in which they are filled is 

Sδ η= N

, which is exactly 

*

*

the same excess entropy we calculated in going from a sorted state to a resorted state in 

the Maxwell Demon problem.

measured entropy at time

 and at the end of the day, respectively. We measured the 

efficiency as a function of time during the trading day for two high volume stocks, 

Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC); two medium volume stocks, Network Appliance 

(NTAP) and PeopleSoft (PSFT); and two low volume stocks, C. H. Robinson 

Worldwide (CHRW) and Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC) over the period August 1, 2003 to 

August 12, 2003. All six stocks are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange. In that 

period there were approximately 1 million trades for a total of approximately 1.5 billion 

shares traded in the six stocks. Microsoft and Intel dominated the trade volume. Data 

were downloaded daily from S&P Comstock. 

The fraction of orders filled, or fill efficiency, for Microsoft is displayed in Figure 

4. Note that two regimes are apparent, a late-time regime in which the efficiency scales 

linearly with time consistent with a Poisson Process, and an early-time regime in which 

the efficiency is better described by a Supply/Demand Process. We see similar 

behaviour for all the stocks studied. The information efficiency is displayed in Figure 5.

each end of day is within a few percent of  (

of the trading day. Two theoretical curves are displayed, a Poisson curve that is 

proportional to time and a Supply/Demand curve that accounts for depletion of 

orders. We see two regimes. At late times the Fill Efficiency scales linearly with 

time as one would expect from a Poisson Process. At early times, the Fill 

Efficiency is better described by the Supply/Demand curve calculated from the 

market entropy.

stock. The theoretical forecast is displayed as a heavy line. The measured 

information efficiencies at zero fill efficiency are within a few percent of the 

theoretical predictions. 

The information efficiency for a medium size stock, PeopleSoft, is displayed in Figure 6. 

The variation in entropy is the highest of the stocks we studied. This variation is due to 

several larger than average trades. Typically, larger than average trades drive the 

entropy to larger efficiency values than predicted by the theory.

Discussion 

We have solved an idealized version of the Maxwell Demon problem and applied 

it to the definition and measurement of the information efficiency of markets. Two 

fundamental constants common to both problems emerge. In the Maxwell Demon case 

we calculate the efficiency of an engine driven by information. Because of the similarity 

between this engine and the whimsical restaurant-driven rocket ship proposed by 

Douglas Adams15, we call the constants Bistro Constants.  We find two regimes, one in 

which supply/demand for stocks plays an important role and one in which the market 

orders seem to obey a Poisson process.  

We propose the following interpretation of the observations: 

Complexica Report 031115 

14 

Early in the trading day, the information efficiencies are characterized by a model that 

accounts for supply/demand in market orders. In fact, at early times in the trading day, 

the Unfilled to Filled Model fits the data quantitatively well. For very early times, 

before many orders have been filled, the probabilities for long and short orders are ½ 

each and the process resembles a Poisson Process. As orders are filled, however, the 

process deviates from a Poisson Process.  

Late in the trading day traders are pressured to unwind their positions. The observations 

indicate that a Poisson Process in which long/short market orders enter the market each 

with probability ½ characterizes the data. The behaviour of the market in this period 

resembles a Poisson Process. 

The middle of the day is a transition period for the market. During this period the 

market moves from a model in which supply/demand dominates to a market 

characterized by a Poisson Process. 

The authors would like to thank Seth Myers for his diligent downloading and collection

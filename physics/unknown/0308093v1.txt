Abstract 

 
A long-term study of the elements Mg, Al, Si, P, Ca, S, Cl, Fe and Mn in leaves is in progress. The objective 
of  this  study  is  to  develop  a  week-by-week  profile  of  these  elements  in  leaves  during  several  growing 
seasons. The profile includes the following information: (1) Which elements each tree collects in its leaves. 
(2)  The  location  in  the  leaf  with  the  highest  concentration,  top  side,  under  side  or  interior.  (3)  The  week 
during the growing season when each element first appears in the leaves of each tree. (4) The change in the 
relative  concentration  from  week  to  week.  (5)  The  source  of  the  element  i.e.,  deposition  from  the 
atmosphere or the root system of the tree. This information is profile for each year and will be correlated 
with environmental conditions for that year. Leaves are collected weekly from first unfolding in early spring 
until leaf drop in the fall. They are from the 31 trees and 26 species in Broome County, NY. From time to 
time  leaves  from  most  of  the  26  species  are  being  randomly  collected  from  trees  growing  throughout  the 
northeastern US.  
 
 
 
 

Discussion 

 
 
       The pignut hickory (Carya glabra) is perhaps one of the more spectacular examples 
of polar concentration and timing of nutrient element uptake in trees. X-ray spectra data is 
presented  in  Fig.  1  showing  the  element  content  in  the  surface  of  leaves  collected  from 
unfolding in the spring through leaf dropping in the fall. Leaves at less than three days old 
were  first  collected  on  May  20,  1996.  There  is  little  distinction  in  element  content 
between  the  topside  and  underside  of  the  leaves  at  this  early  stage  of  development. 
However,  as  the  leaves  grow,  a  clear  distinction  develops  between  the  topside  and 
underside. In pignut hickory the accumulation of Mn begin between May 20 and May 31, 
Ca between May 31 and June 13, and Al between June 24 and July 1. The pignut hickory 
is not unique in showing this kind of uptake pattern; however, it does appear to be unique 
with respect to Al and Mn uptake and location in the leaf. When the leaves of the trees in 
this  study  (26  species)  first  unfold,  they  look  very  similar  to  the  pignut hickory. Within 
days to weeks, however, they begin to “take up” elements in a pattern that appears to be 
unique to the species and sometimes unique to a specific tree within a species even when 
branches and roots overlap. 
 
 
       Leaves are collected from the same trees at regular intervals (7-10 days) from the date 
of  first  appearance  until  leaf  dropping  in  the  fall.  Usually  five  leaves  are  collected  and 
immediately  vacuum  dried.  A  small  sample  of  each  leaf  (about  2  cm2)  is  placed  in  a 
specially  designed1,  2  X-ray  fluorescence  spectrometer,  and  X-ray  spectra  of  elements  in 
the leaf surface  are produced.  The  leaf sample is then rotated 180° and the procedure is

repeated. This is key to the determination of element content in the top and undersides of 
leaves  to  a  depth  of  less  than  2μm.  Pulverizing  a  sample  of  a  leaf  and  analyzing  the 
powder,  the  usual  method3,  4,  is  used  to  obtain  information  about  the  interior  of  leaves. 
Figure 2 is a typical example of the type of information that is both lost and gained when a 
leaf is pulverized. It is clear that the Ca/Al and the Ca/Mn ratios are dramatically different 
for each analysis. All three analyses were done on the same leaf sample and normalized to 
the same  count in a region  of  the  spectra around 3 keV. When this is done, the relative 
concentration  of each  element  in the leaf may be inferred from the number of counts in 
each peak. It is clear that most of the Al is in the topside layer and virtually all of the Mn 
is  in  the  underside  layer  of  the  leaf.  Potassium,  Sulfur,  and  Chlorine  are  mostly 
concentrated inside the leaf5.

Fig. 1. X-ray spectra of the elements on the topside (red) and underside (black) of leaves 
collected from a pignut hickory. Elements with an atomic number below 12 cannot be 
detected with the equipment used in this study. Leaves were collected on the date shown 
in each sub-figure. The spectra in each subfigure show the approximate relative 
concentration of each element in the surface layer of leaves on the tree at the time of 
collection. When the name of an element appears twice it is a denotation of the Kα and Kβ 
X-rays for that element, the Kα is the larger peak. Note that the Kβ of potassium and the 
Kα of calcium overlap. The equipment used in this study does not resolve the Kα, Kβ X-
rays of elements below potassium.

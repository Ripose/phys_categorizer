curvilinear waves electrodynamics

ABSTRACT. In previous papers within the framework of the non-linear electromagnetic field 
theory - curvilinear waves electrodynamics (CWED) - we have considered the opportunity of 
occurrence of electromagnetic elementary particles, similar to leptons and hadrons. In present 
paper  we  will  show  that  on  this  basis  the  spectra  of  more  complex  electromagnetic  particles 
can also be naturally created 

1.0. Introduction  

According to modern representations, all elementary particles are the bound states (including 
the exited states) of a small set of particles. For example, according to (Gottfried and Weisskopf, 
1984): "The nucleon is simply a basic state of a compound spectrum of particles which we have 
named a baryon spectrum. Similarly pion is the lowest state of meson spectrum".  

In present paper we will show that in the framework of CWED the spectra of more complex 
electromagnetic particles as bound and exited states of a small set of some basic particles, can be 
formed. 

1.1. Electromagnetic elementary particles of CWED 

As  elementary  particles  of  CWED  we  mean  the  electromagnetic  particles  that  arise  and  are 
described  within the framework of CWED.  As  we have  shown,  it  is  possible  to  compare  them 
with  the  actually  existing  elementary  particles  described  by  the  quantum  field  theory,  whose 
existence is confirmed with experiments (Kyriakos, 2004a; b; c). 

Generally each elementary particle is defined by a set of various characteristics: a mass, a spin, 
an electric charge, the strong and weak "charges" (i.e. the characteristics, which define intensity of 
strong and weak interaction), the numbers of  "affinity" (numbers, owing to which one family of 
particles differs from another - lepton, baryon and other numbers), etc. 

The  particles  characterized  by  identical  characteristics,  except  for  any  one  of  them,  create  a 
spectrum  of  elementary  particles  regarding  this  variable  characteristic.  For  example,  if  as  such 
variable  characteristic  the  mass  of  particles  is  accepted,  they  speak  about  a  mass  spectrum  of 
elementary particles. 

According  to  the  modern  theory  there  are  some  limiting  conditions  of  the  composition  of 
elementary  particles,  which  can  be  named  the  conservation  laws  of  this  characteristic:  e.g.  the 
laws  of  conservation  of  energy,  momentum,  angular  momentum,  laws  of  conservation  of  an 
electric charge and charges of other interactions, laws of conservation of numbers of  "affinity", 
etc.  Some  laws  (principles)  also  exist,  such  as  a  principle  of  uncertainty  of  Heisenberg,  which 
restrict the transition from one family or a spectrum of particles to another. 

As  is  known,  the  existing  field  theory  cannot  explain  the  occurrence  of  elementary  particle 
characteristics and cannot deduce the majority of conservation laws of these characteristics: they 
are entered as consequences of experiments. 

 

 
 

 
                                               2 

If  to  speak,  for  example,  about  mass  spectra  of  particles,  the  following  restrictions  exist  on 

creation of such spectra:  

1)  according  to  the  energy-momentum  conservation  law  the  rest  free  light  particles  cannot 

break up to heavier particles, but heavy particles can break up to more light particles; 

2)  nevertheless,  according  to  a  uncertainty  principle  of  Heisenberg,  heavy  particles  cannot 
comprise the light particles as a ready particles (for example, the neutron cannot comprise electron 
as a free particle). 

The  conclusions  of  the  quantum  theory  are  undoubtedly  correct  and  was  confirmed  by 

experiments, and we should show, that they do not contradict to the results of CWED. 

2.0. A hypothesis of formation of spectra of elementary particles in 
CWED 

Within the framework of CWED the electromagnetic twirled waves (EM-particles) possess the 
same  characteristics,  as  quantum  elementary  particles.  As  we  saw  (Kyriakos,  2004a,b,c),  the 
twirled harmonic waves, appearing here, can have integer or half spin, can be charged or neutral, 
etc. The mass of particles within the frameworks of CWED is the "stopped" energy of the twirled 
standing wave. Thus, roughly speaking, to a heavy particle by our representation corresponds the 
twirled wave of high frequency, and to light particle - the twirled wave of lower frequency. Thus, 
we should explain the existence of spectra of the particles relatively to all these particularities. 

To  the  simple  harmonic  waves  in  Classical  Electrodynamics  (briefly  CED),  the  twirled 
harmonic  waves  in  CWED  correspond.  Does  exist  in  CED  the  opportunity  of  coexistence  of 
several waves as some material formation - an elementary particle, in which the characteristics of 
various waves can be superposed? 

As we know, such opportunity actually exists and it consists in the waves superposition, which 
leads  to  various  forms  of  coexistence  of  normal  harmonic  waves  and  to  the  occurrence  of 
complex non-harmonic waves, which "consist" of harmonic waves of various frequencies. 

Analogically  to  the  representations  of  classical  theory  of  EM  waves,  whose  non-linear 

generalization our theory is, we assume that: 

the reason of complication of EM particles and of occurrence of its spectra is the superposition 
of  simple  (harmonic)  twirled  waves,  and  the  reason    of  disintegrations  of  particles    is  the 
disintegration of the compound twirled waves. 

The  purpose  of  our  paper  will  be  to  show  that  such  superposition  exists  and  its  description 
completely corresponds to modern theoretical representations and is in full accordance with the 
experimental data. 

As CWED is non-linear  generalization  of  classical  (linear)  electrodynamics, it  is possible to 
assume, that the opportunity of the mathematical description of creation of waves spectra should 
exist  already  in  CED.  Besides,  since  mathematical  description  of  CWED  completely  coincides 
with the mathematical description of quantum electrodynamics (QED), we should show that the 
similar forms exist  in QED as well as in CWED. Therefore we will build the further statement on 
the  comparison  of  these  three  areas  of  the  description  of  elementary  wave  constituents  of  the 
nature: CED, CWED and QED. 

2.1. Superposition of «linear» waves 

As  is  known  (Grawford,  1970),  the  motion  of  compound  system  can  be  represented  by 
superposition  of  more  simple  motions,  occurring  simultaneously  and  named  “modes”  (terms: 
“simple  harmonic  oscillation”,  “harmonics”,  “normal  oscillation”,  “own  oscillation”,  “normal 
mode”  or  simply  “mode”  are  identical).  Properties  of  each  mode  of  any  compound  system  are 
very similar to properties of simple harmonic oscillator. 

In many physical phenomena the system motion represents a superposition of two harmonic 
ω . These oscillations can, for example, 

oscillations, having various angular frequencies 

ω  and

correspond  to  two  normal  modes  of  the  system,  having  two  degrees  of  freedom.  (a  known 
example of such system is the molecule of ammonia (Grawford, 1970)). 

It is true as well for the quantum mechanical waves, described by quantum wave functions. It 
is possible to illustrate this fact on an example of formation of an energy spectrum of electron in 
an orbit of hydrogen atom. Really, the electron energy spectrum in an electron-proton system is 
from the general point of view a spectrum of electron masses. It is possible to speak about a basic 
mass (basic energy) in not exited state, and about a lot of masses of electron in the exited states, 
when  electron  receives  additional  portions  of  energy  (mass).  These  portions  are  very  small  in 
comparison  with  the  basic  electron  energy  (mass),  which  we  cannot  say  about  masses  of  the 
particles,  appearing  at  disintegrations  of  elementary  particles.  But,  nevertheless,  it  does  not 
exclude that these are the phenomenon of the same type. The increase of electron mass occurs due 
to absorption of photons, and the reduction of mass takes place due to emission of photons. On the 
other hand, we actually cannot tell, that the electron contains a photon as a ready particle. 

It is also easy to show (Grawford, 1970), that the change of electron energy as a result of its 
excitation by a photon corresponds to a hypothesis about the occurrence of new particles owing to 
superposition of waves. 

Let's consider the steady-states of the electron in one-dimensional potential well with infinitely 

high walls, whose coordinates are

 and 

z

 . We will also assume that the electron

Obviously,  the  frequency  of  radiation  is  defined  by  beats  frequency.  Actually,  electron  is 
charged and, consequently, it will emit out of the electromagnetic radiation of the same frequency, 
with which it oscillates. From the equation (1) we see, that average position of a charge oscillates

In the framework of CWED, the non-normalized quantum wave function is simply the wave 
field. As a consequence of this fact, the square of this wave function (i.e. the possibility density in 
the  framework  of  QED)  is  the  energy  density.  As  example  of  such  problem  in  framework  of 
CWED we will consider the calculation of more general case of the interference between waves 
of various frequencies.

3.0. Superposition of the twirled electromagnetic waves 

So, we should show at first that the superposition of the twirled electromagnetic waves exists 
and secondly that owing to it, it is possible to receive all those results, which are known from the 
theory of linear electromagnetic waves. In other words, it is necessary to show, that in this case 
there are  actually  series (spectra) of particles,  each of which represents  complication due to the 
superposition of other twirled waves. 

As  is  known,  all  the  phenomena  of  superposition  of  waves  and  their  disintegration  are 
described  by  Fourier  theory  (Fourier  analysis-synthesis  theory),  in  which  it  is  shown,  that  any 
field can be synthesized from harmonic waves or analysed to harmonic waves. We will show that 
Fourier theory is true in case of the twirled waves as well as in case of linear waves. 

3.1. The real and complex form solutions of the wave equation, as reflection of 
an objective reality

Nowadays it is considered that the representation of the wave equation (or oscillation equation)

We  have  shown  (Kyriakos,  2005),  that  within  the  framework  of  CWED  the  exponential 
solutions have an actual meaning, if we understand them in geometrical sense as the description 
of motion of a wave on a curvilinear (particularly circular) trajectory (or, in other words, as the 
sum  of  two  linear  mutual-perpendicular  oscillations).  (We  have  noted  that  due  to  this  fact  the 
solutions of the wave equations of the quantum theory are not real, but complex wave functions). 

Thus, it is possible to assume, that the existence of the real and complex solutions of the wave 
equation indicates the existence in the nature of two types of real objects: the linear and twirled 
(curvilinear) waves. At that the real functions describe linear waves, and the  complex functions 
describe the curvilinear (twirled) waves 

As is known, the functions, describing complex periodic and non-periodic processes of non-
harmonic  type  can  be  presented  by  the  sum  of  harmonic  functions  owing  to  Fourier  analysis-
synthesis  theory.  It  must  be  noted  that  the  Fourier  analysis-synthesis  theory  allows  working 
equally both with real and complex functions. 

From  this  the  extremely  important  conclusion  follows  that  all  tools  of  the  Fourier  analysis-
synthesis theory of functions in complex representation is the mathematical apparatus, describing 
the superposition and decomposition of complex twirled waves (i.e. of complex electromagnetic 
elementary particles).  

In  other  words,  the  complex  representation  of  electromagnetic  waves  and  all  mathematical 
apparatus of Fourier analysis-synthesis theory represent mathematical tool of CWED in the same 
degree  as  the  mathematical  apparatus  of  the  real  functions  of  Fourier  analysis-synthesis  theory 
represents the mathematical tool of usual linear Maxwellа-Lorentz theory (i.e. CED). 

    Due to above, the non-linear theory of the twirled waves is the theory in which the principle 

of superposition takes place as well in the linear theory. 

For this reason the Maxwell-Lorenz theory can be written down in a complex form and it looks 
in  such  form  simple  and  consistent.  Transition  from  the  twirled  waves  to  linear  (i.e.  to  one  of 
components of the twirled wave) corresponds to transition from complex values to real (which is 
carried out by calculation of a real part of complex value of quantities and functions). 

Let  us  consider  now  some  details  of  the  Fourier  analysis-synthesis  theory  in  case  of 

superposition of the twirled waves. 

4.0. Elementary particles as wave packets 

As is known, in case of superposition more than two linear harmonic running waves the wave 
groups  or  wave  packets  are  formed,  which  are  the  limited  in  space  formations,  which  transfer 
energy and move with some group speed. 

In  the  quantum  mechanics  a  wave  packet  (Physics  encyclopedia,  V.1,  1960)  is  the  concept, 
designating a field of waves of a matter, concentrated in the limited area. The probability to find a 
particle is distinct from zero only in the area, occupied by a wave packet. The less are the sizes of 
a packet, the more is the particle localized. It is possible to consider this wave field as result of 
superposition of the  certain set  of plane  waves  (from  here  follows  the  name  “a  wave  packet”), 
corresponding to the different wavelengths and, hence, to the different momentums of a particle. 
The possibility of similar decomposition on flat waves is a simple result of a possibility to analyse 
any function in a Fourier series or Fourier integral.

Thus,  knowing  that  superposition  of  linear  waves  leads  to  formation  of  the  linear  wave 
packets, it is consistent to conclude that superposition of the twirled waves leads to formation of 
the twirled wave packets, i.e. to the compound electromagnetic elementary particles. 

It  is  characteristic  that  the  representation  of  wave  function  by  the  Fourier  sum,  i.e.  Fourier

Thus, the reference to the negative frequencies is connected with change of basic functions, by 
means  of  which  Fourier-transformation  is  carried  out,  namely  with  transition  to  the  rotating 
complex  vectors  as  to  the  basic  functions  of  Fourier-transformation.  The  above  completely 
corresponds  to  our  representations  on  conformity  of  Fourier  mathematical  tools  with  the 
requirements of CWED. 

As a simple example of formation of a wave packet, we will consider a packet formed by the 
equidistant  rectangular  frequency  spectrum  of  waves  of  equal  amplitudes.  The  description  of 
superposition of such waves can be made in real (Grawford, 1970)  as well as in a complex form 
(Matveev, 1985), that reflects the existence of the linear and non-linear world of particles. 

We will find the exact expression for an packet

to  show  (Grawford,  1970),  that  for  a  wave  packet,  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principles  are  true, 
what proves their wave origin. 

Since the twirled waves by their origin already represent the limited objects, it is possible to 
assume, that the electromagnetic particles should be combined not from infinite Fourier series, but 
they should be presented by the sum of the limited number of harmonics, i.e. of the twirled waves. 
To describe the synthesis of the complex particles (packets) from more simple sub-packets, we 
will show, that any wave packet can be presented in the form of the sum of wave sub-packets. In 
this  case,  obviously,  superposition  (interaction)  of  several  big  packets  can  be  considered  not  as 
superposition  (interaction)  of  their  separate  harmonic  components,  but  as  superposition  of  their 
sub-packets. 

Let’s consider the splitting of a big packet into two sub-packets. We will present a compound

It is convenient to enter a contraction for a normal harmonic

 (4.4) 

From  the  above-stated  calculations  it  is  visible  that  decomposition  on  sub-packets  is  not 
unambiguous, since the  sub-packets can be grouped from harmonic waves in various ways. It is 
possible to assume, that the decay  of the same particle on different channels can be considered as 
an opportunity of disintegration of a wave packet of the twirled waves on various sub-packets (i.e. 
the various sums of partial wave packets).  

Using the above-stated reason it is easy to prove also that superposition (interaction) of sub-
packets leads to the same consequences as interaction of separate harmonic waves, i.e. it leads to 
beats and to change of the energy level, independent from other non-interacting sub-packets (and 
also to the change of the energy level of the basic packets) 

Except  for  curvilinearity  in  CWED  there  is  one  more  serious  difference  from  linear 
electrodynamics: in CWED alongside with the full periodic twirled waves (bosons), exist also the 
half-period  twirled  waves  (fermions).  This  creates  a  great  number  of  additional  variants  of  the 
wave superposition,  which  are  not  present in linear electrodynamics.  Besides, the  curvilinearity 
enters into the physics one more characteristic of particles - the currents. 

 

 
 

 
                                               8 

It is not difficult to understand that the superposition of the twirled waves in comparison with 
the superposition of linear waves has more variants in a spatial arrangement of waves, and, hence, 
more  complex  mathematical  description.  Actually  we  can  see  this  in  the  case  of  description  of 
hadrons (Kyriakos, 2004c). 

It  is  easy  to  see,  that  the  principle  of  superposition  does  not  provide  stability  or,  at  least, 
metastability  of  compound  electromagnetic  particles.  Thus,  we  should  additionally  find  out  the 
conditions of stability of the twirled waves. 

5.0. The resonance theory of stability of elementary particles in 
CWED 

  As  electromagnetic  particles  represent  the  spatial  formations,  here  it  is  necessary  to  speak 
about spatial packets, which are formed by superposion of waves of a various direction in space 
(in  the  elementary  case,  by  superposion  of  the  harmonic  waves  propagating  on  three  mutual-
perpendicular coordinate axes).  

  As  is  known  (Shpolskii,  1951),  at  the  superposition  of  harmonic  waves  are  formed  the 
Lissajous figures of two various types. At commensurable frequencies of waves, are formed the 
standing  waves;  at  incommensurable  frequencies  the  motion  of  waves  is  refered  to  as  quasi-
periodic. 

In  the  physics  of  waves  and  oscillations  exist  two  sorts  of  the  problems  leading  to  the 

occurrence of the compound waves and oscillations. 

An example of first type of problems is oscillation of the body volume (sphere, cylinder, torus, 
etc.), by which we represent a particle. Here the suitable mechanical example is the oscillation of 
the  sphere  prepared  from  a  hydrophobic  liquid,  placed  in  water  (for  example,  a  sphere  from 
mineral oil in water). In a microcosm the object, which possesses similar oscillations, is the drop 
model of a nucleus. 

Problems concerning the same type are also the problems of oscillation of vortical rings in a 
perfect  liquid  or  gas,  studied  by  Kelvin  (we  will  name  conditionally  such  problems  Kelvin's 
problems). In case of the oscillations of the linear vortex considered in work (Lord Kelvin, 1867) 
he  obtains  the  exact  solution.  Here  Kelvin  has  compared  the  radiation  spectra  of  the  atoms, 
obtained little time before by Bunsen, to possible spectra of oscillation of vortex. Comparison of 
such type of oscillations with observable results is available e.g. in works (Paper collection, 1975) 
and (Kopiev and Chernyshev, 2000). (It is necessary to note, that in his articles Kelvin used the 
term  “atoms”  in  sense  of  Democritus  as  the  smallest  indivisible  constituents,  i.e.  in  modern 
terminology as elementary particles).  

Certain of the Kelvin significant conclusions from the paper “Atom as Vortex” we cite below:  
     “The author called attention to a very important property of the vortex atom. The dynamical 
theory of this subject require that the ultimate constitution of simple bodies should have one or 
more fundamental periods of vibration, as has a stringed instrument of one or more strings.  

     As the experiments illustrate, the vortex atom has perfectly definite fundamental modes of 
vibration, depending solely on that motion the existence of which constitutes it. The discovery of 
these fundamental modes forms an intensely interesting problem of pure mathematics. Even for a 
simple  Helmholtz  ring,  the  analytical  difficulties,  which  it  presents,  are  of  a  very  formidable 
character. The author had attempted to work it for an infinitely long, straight, cylindrical vortex. 
For  this  case  he  was  working  out  solutions  corresponding  to  every  possible  description  of 
infinitesimal vibration.  

One very simple result, which he could now state is the following. Let such a vortex be given 
with  its  section  differing  from  exact  circular  figure  by  an  infinitesimal  harmonic  deviation  of 
order i. This form will travel as waves round the axis of the cylinder in the same direction as the 
vortex rotation, with an angular velocity equal to (i-1)/i of the  angular velocity of this rotation. 
Hence, as the number of crests in a whole circumference is equal to i, for an harmonic deviation 

 

 
 

 

 

 
                                               9 

of order i there are i-1 periods of vibration in the period of revolution of the vortex. For the case 
i=1  there  is  no  vibration,  and  the  solution  expresses  merely  an  infinitesimally  displaced  vortex 
with its circular form unchanged. The case i=2 corresponds to elliptic deformation of the circular 
section;  and  for  it  the  period  of  vibration  is,  therefore,  simply  the  period  of  revolution.  These 
results are, of course, applicable to the Helmholtz ring when the diameter of the approximately 
circular section is small in comparison with the diameter of the ring, as it is in the smoke-rings 
exhibited to the Society.  

The lowest fundamental modes of the two forms of transverse vibrations of a ring, such as the 
vibrations that were seen in the experiments, must be much graver than the elliptic vibration of the 
section. It is probable that the vibrations which constitute the incandescence of sodium-vapour are 
analogous to those which the smoke-rings had exhibited”.  

As examples of other type of problems are oscillations of sound  and electromagnetic waves 
into  various  types  of  the  closed  cavities,  whose  surface  is  motionless.  Such  cavities  refer  to  as 
closed  wave-guides  or  resonators  and  consequently  we  will  conditionally  name  this  type  of 
problems the closed wave-guide or resonator problems. In the classical physics a set of researches 
is  devoted  to  such  type  of  problems.  Examples  of  such  type  of  problems  are  also  eigenvalues 
problems of wave functions in the quantum mechanics, which we will consider briefly below. 

The above first and second type of problems leads to solutions of type of the standing waves, 

which have the relative time stability. 

Thus, it is possible to  assume,  that  stability  (or  the  relative  stability  named  metastability) of 

electromagnetic particles is connected with a formation of standing waves.  

As is known, a mathematical condition of occurrence of standing waves is the proportionality 
of wavelength to the size of body (volume), in which the wave propagates. Therefore, at the search 
of a possible solution of these sorts of problems the basic role the limits play, which are imposed 
on propagation of waves or, in other words, the boundary states, imposed on wave functions. 

Below  we  will  show  that  from  this  boundary  states  follow  the  quantization  conditions  of 

From Maxwell-Lorentz equations it is easy to obtain (Matveev, 1989) wave equation for the 

characteristics of electromagnetic elementary particles.

The  equation  (5.3)  refers  to  as  Helmholtz  equation  and  is  universal  for  the  description  of 

coordinate dependence of characteristics of harmonic waves. 

Within  the  framework  of  this  equation,  is  constructed  the  Kirchgoff  diffraction  and 
interference  theory  of light,  which  has  excellently  proved to  be true  an  enormous  experimental 
material. 

5.2. Wave equation solution for resonator  

To analyse the electromagnetic wave equation solution for resonator we will take (Wainstein, 
1957) an orthogonal box from metal with a, b and d sites as our model of resonator. We will show 
that this solution is the standing electromagnetic waves. 

According  to  (5.2)  the  electric  field  must  satisfy  the  equations  (

the walls, because there could be surface charge on the wall. This means a possible solution is:

Thus,  the  character  of  the  general  solution  for  EM  wave  in  the  cavity  is  the  standing 

electromagnetic wave. 

It is easy to see, that the  stated above description  of occurrence  of a resonance of the linear 
waves, if we make it in the complex form, will correspond to the occurrence of the resonance of 
the curvilinear (twirled) waves. 

Show now that the quantum wave equation solutions  for the stationary states give the identical  

results.

6.0. The quantum wave equations and their solutions for stationary 
waves 

De Broglie has assumed that material particles alongside with corpuscular properties have as 
well the wave properties so that to the energy and momentum of a particle in a corpuscular picture 
there correspond the wave frequency  and  wavelength in  a  wave picture.  De Broglie  has shown 
that in this case from relativistic transformations the parities strictly follow:

Really,  replacing  the  energy  and  momentum  by  the  wave  characteristics,  we  will  receive  a 

dispersion correlation for waves of a matter: 

It is easy to see, that within the framework of CWED this dispersion correlation satisfies to the 
equation  of  the  twirled  photon  (see  ),  which  produce  the  Dirac  equations  for  the  electron  and 
positron. 

We will consider now, to what wave equation there corresponds this dispersion correlation. 

6.1. Helmholtz Equation for de Broglie waves

quantum theory are usually named the potential wells. From the mathematical point of view these 
problems refer to as eigenvalues problems. 

Consider the connection of these problems with CWED. 

7.0. Principles of formation of elementary particles spectra in QED 

The first calculations of quantum systems  concerned the electron motion in the orbits of the 
hydrogen  atom.  The  formulas  of  quantization  of  electron  characteristics  in  the  hydrogen  atom 
have been first found empirically (formulas of Balmer, Paschen, etc.) . Then, it has been shown 
that they turn out as consequence of conditions of Bohr quantization. 

The  generalization of  Bohr quantization  rules  has been made independently  by  Wilson and 
Sommerfeld. They have shown, that in case of systems with any number of degree of freedom it 
is  possible  to  find  such  generalized  coordinates 
,  in  which  the  motion  of  system  is 
separated on  f  harmonic oscillations; in this case a known rule of oscillator quantization can be 
applied  for  any  of  degrees  of  freedom.  Owing  to  this  generalization  we  receive  f   quantum 
conditions:

any field can be represented as the oscillators sum, it is necessary to consider this rule as true for 
any quantum systems. 

It is not difficult to see, that within the framework of CWED these rules are natural rules of a 
resonance  of  the  twirled  electromagnetic  waves,  if  we  take  into  account  a  quantization  rule  of 
their energy according to Planck-de Broglie. 

The results, received according to Wilson-Sommerfeld quantization rules, have later appeared 
as solutions of the wave equation for standing de Broglie waves (i.e. the Schroedinger equation)

for various sorts of potential wells (Shpolskii, 1951). Thus, Schroedinger equation is the equation 
for calculation of resonance states of an electronic wave in potential wells (resonators) of various 
type, boundary of wave motion in which are defined by potential energy of the system. Note, that 
the boundary states are expressed here by the same way, as in the classical theory of EM field:

It is easy to show, that this problem is absolutely identical to the problem of stand EM wave in 
resonators  (and  also  to  the  problem  of  oscillation  of  strings,  membranes  or  elastic  body).  The 
distinction  is  that  the  wave  vector  is  not  constant  here,  but  by  some  complex  way  depends  on 
spatial  coordinates;  or,  in  other  words,  the  dispersion  relation  is  here  defined  by  potential  of 
system, which  varies from a point to point according (6.2).  

Actually, it is not difficult to imagine that medium in the electromagnetic resonator can possess 
a  dispersion,  depending  on  spatial  coordinates  under  the  same  law,  as  potential  energy  in  a 
potential well of quantum-mechanical problem. Recollecting that within the framework of CWED 
the EM wave function is identical to wave function of quantum mechanics, it is easy to see, that 
boundary states in a quantum-mechanical problem must coincide with the boundary states in CED 
and CWED. 

Conclusion 

Thus, we have shown, that the own spectra of elementary particles in CWED must arise in the 
same  manner  as  the  resonance  states  in  any  wave  theory.  The  originality  in  comparison  with 
calculation of stationary states of a particle in a field of other particles (solution for Schroedinger 
or Dirac electron equations) consists in the fact that in this case we have not an external field (i.e. 
an external potential box), but the particles themselves are like such a box.

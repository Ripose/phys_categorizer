Magnets  

Andrey M. Akhmeteli and Andrew V. Gavrilin 

Abstract—The  mathematical  foundation  is  laid  for  a  relatively  new  type of magnets generating uniform  transverse  field – tilted 
coil  magnets. These consist of concentric nested solenoidal coils with elliptical turns tilted at a certain angle to the central axis and 
current  flowing  in  opposite  directions  in  the  coils  tilted  at  opposite  angles,  generating  a  perfectly  uniform  transverse  field.  Both 
superconducting  wire-wound  and  resistive  Bitter  tilted coils  are discussed.  An  original  analytical  method  is  used  to prove  that  the 
wire-wound tilted coils have the ideal distribution of the axial linear current density – “cosine-theta”. Magnetic fields are calculated 
for a tilted Bitter coil magnet using an original exact solution for current density in an elliptical Bitter disk. Superconducting wire-
wound  tilted  coil  magnets may  become an alternative for traditional dipole magnets for accelerators, and Bitter tilted coil magnets 
are attractive for rotation experiments with a large access port perpendicular to the field.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

T

HE  idea  to  use  superconducting  wire-wound  and  resistive 
Bitter  concentric  nested  tilted  coils  for  uniform  transverse 
field generation has been around for some time already (see [1] 
and  references  there)  and  has  been  considered  in  a  number  of 
recent publications [1-4]. Nevertheless, this type of coils can be 
still regarded as a novel one. In a “tilted coil magnet”, elliptical 
turns  are  tilted  at  a  certain  angle  (“tilt  angle”)  to  the  central 
axis,  and  current  is  flowing  in  opposite  directions  in  the  coils 
tilted  at  opposite  angles,  generating  a  perfectly  uniform 
transverse  field, as  longitudinal  components of  the field cancel 
each  other  out,  leaving  only  a  dipole  component  of  the  field 
(Figs. 1,2),  if  the  average  current  density and coils’  length are 
properly  chosen  and  adjusted.  The  resultant  transverse  field  is 
extremely uniform indeed, as calculations show [1-4], and tilted 
coil magnets, both superconducting [2] and resistive [1,2], look 
rather 
the  practical  point  of  view. 
Superconducting  wire-wound  tilted  coil  magnets  may  become 
an  alternative  for  traditional  dipole  magnets  for  accelerators 
[2,3],  and  Bitter  tilted  coil  magnets  are  attractive  for  rotation 
experiments  with  a  large  access  port  perpendicular  to  the  field 
that  a  hybrid  configuration, 
[5].  It 
comprising  a  Bitter  tilted  coil  insert  and  a  superconducting 
tilted coil outsert, seems to be the only option to obtain uniform 
transverse  magnetic  field  about  30T  DC  within  a  reasonably 
large volume of space.

II.   WIRE-WOUND TILTED COIL AS A GENERALIZED “COSINE-
THETA” CONFIGURATION 

Perhaps  there  exist  several  ways  to  explain  mathematically 
why transverse field generated by a wire-wound tilted coil is so 
uniform. Still this problem has not been properly treated in the 
literature;  at  least,  we  failed  to  supply  this  paper  with  any 
references.  Here  we  suggest  a  rather  simple  method  to  prove 
that  wire-wound  circular  tilted  coils  have  a  generalized 
“cosine-theta” distribution of axial current density. In order to 
do so, it is sufficient to consider a fragment of one layer of the 
winding (Fig. 3).  

Let  us  assume  that  the  wire  is  wound  in  such  a  way  that 
centers  of  cross-sections  of  the  wire  lie  on  the  following 
parametric curve (a tilted cylindrical helix, Fig. 3):

It should be noted that the magnitude of the average current density 

depends on θ, although neither the current, I , 
nor the wire cross-section depend on θ. This is due to the fact that the winding cannot be uniformly tight in this geometry, and 
the gap,  g , between two adjacent turns of the winding depends on θ: 
. As can be seen, the gap is minimal

It is noteworthy that a constant component of the axial current appears due to the helical path of wire – it disappears if each 
turn is considered as a flat ellipse. Formally speaking, the presence of the constant component of axial current is a distinction, 
compared  to  classic cosine-theta  coils,  which  basically do  not  have  such  a “makeweight”.  Nevertheless,  this  is “a  distinction 
without a difference”, which does not deteriorate the ideal uniformity of transverse field within the bore.

assuming that the coil is wound as tightly as possible. 
  Obviously,  the  more  layers  of  winding are  used,  the higher 
transverse field can be obtained at the same current. As to the 

axial  component  of  the  magnetic  field,  also  generated  by  a 
tilted coil, it can be easily cancelled out through the use of two 
nested  oppositely  tilted  coils  energized  with  opposite  polarity 
[2,3]  (Fig.  1).  The  same  is  correct  for  Bitter  tilted  magnets 
discussed below. 
 

III.  RESISTIVE BITTER TILTED COILS 

As  opposed  to  wire-wound  tilted  coils,  Bitter  tilted  coils 
(Fig. 4) are much more complicated for analysis. The magnetic 
field from  a  tilted coil can be  adequately approximated by the 
field  of  a  number  of  identical  elliptical  disks  parallel  to  each 
other.  In  our  analysis,  we  neglect  the  presence  of  numerous 
holes in the disks.  
 To calculate the magnetic field of a tilted coil, let us calculate 
the current density distribution in one elliptical Bitter disk. 
While for a conventional circular Bitter disk the current 
density distribution obeys a very simple analytical formula [6], 

Fig. 5.  Sketch of an elliptical disk with a coordinate system aligned with it. 
  

 

this is not the case for the current density in an elliptical disk (Fig. 5). However, a more complex exact solution was found for 
the latter for an arbitrary tilt angle. 
 
 
Let us consider an elliptical disk defined by the following equations in Cartesian coordinates

On the upper and the lower banks of the cut, the function equals πand  π− , correspondingly (these values were chosen for 
Φ and 
convenience; if necessary, this solution may be modified in an obvious way to accommodate for the actual values of 
Φ ). At the elliptic boundaries, the projection of the gradient of this function on the normal to the ellipses equals zero (as 
there is no charge flow through these boundaries). 
Using a standard procedure (see, e.g., [7]), one can prove that the function sought realizes an extremum of the functional

(Cholesky decomposition). This is important, as for ellipses with higher eccentricity, numerical stability becomes a difficult 
issue, so multiple-precision arithmetic was used in this work. As more harmonics are left in the solution, the relevant series 
converges to the exact solution exponentially fast. 
Summarizing, we may say that the exact solution for the electric potential (and, consequently, for the current density 
distribution) in the elliptical Bitter disk was found by the Ritz method with multipoles as the appropriate function basis. The 
solution can be naturally extended over several disks and allows easy differentiation. 
For identical disks, it is sufficient to calculate the coefficients of the series just once. Current density

the bases of the disk can be reduced to a sum of one-dimensional integrals (after integration with respect to  r  in the polar 
system of coordinates), but this was not done in this work, and the two-dimensional integral was calculated. 
 
 
It should be mentioned that so far we cannot explain as easily as we did for wire-wound coils the extremely high uniformity 
of  the  field that can be  obtained  with tilted Bitters,  as our  numerical  experiments  clearly show  [1]  –  the solution for current 
density in the disk is too complicated as opposed to that for wire-
wound tilted coils.

IV.  TILTING EFFECT 

Good  examples  of  uniform  transverse magnetic field that can 
be  obtained  with  tilted  coils  are  given  in  previous  publications 
[1-4]. The effect of tilt angle on the transverse field strength was 
also discussed in literature [3], albeit rather briefly and for wire-
wound coils only. In order to give a flavor of this effect for tilted 
Bitter  coils,  we  conducted  some  calculations  for  a  particular 
single  Bitter  coil  with  rather  typical  parameters:  25  mm  inner 
diam, 85 mm outer diam, 2 mm disk (turn) thickness, a total of 
300 disks (turns),  40 kA  transport  current.  In  calculations,  we 
varied  the  tilt  angle  only,  keeping  other  parameters  constant. 
Despite  the  fact  that  the  coil’s length  somewhat  changes  as  the 
tilt angle changes, the coil is long enough to practically exclude 
the length influence on the results (Fig. 6). As one can see, 15% 
increase of the field can be reached when going from 45O to 30O 

 
Fig. 6.  The transverse component of magnetic field on the axis of a single long 
tilted  Bitter  coil,  in  the  central  part  of  the  coil,  vs  the  tilt  angle.  The  axial 
component of the magnetic field is not shown. 
  

 

 

 

 

 
 
tilt angle, which seems attractive, although tilt angle closer to 45O rather than to 30O can turn out to be more optimal from the 
practical point of view. 

12

As can be also inferred from Fig. 6, the field dependence on the tilt angle is non-linear – roughly, the transverse field decreases 
directly  with  cosine  of  tilt  angle.  The  same  is observed  for  wire-wound tilted  coils  (see  [3]).  Thus,  the  use  of  very small tilt 
angles, 30O and less, is not so beneficial, especially if we also take into account that the decrease of tilt angle carries a penalty: 
more difficult assembling, considerable end effects and possibly lower mechanical strength.  

V.  TILTED COIL HYBRID 

As  shown  in  [1],  a  highly  uniform  transverse  field  over  20T  can  be  obtained  with  tilted  Bitter  coil  magnet  with  a  rather 
simple 3-coil configuration within 38 mm bore at reasonable power in the magnet. Unlike a split system, this field is uniform 
over the whole bore along a rather considerable portion of the magnet length (~100 mm and longer). Presumably, as estimates 
show, the maximum transverse field that can be reached with the present Florida-Bitter technology [1] within ~35-38 mm bore 
is about 25 T. In order to achieve 30 T, a hybrid configuration can be a good if not the only option with a Bitter insert and a 
superconducting outsert. For the latter, both a pancake technology described in [2] and layer-wise winding technology [3] can 
be used.  Of course,  quench  analysis  of  superconducting  coils is required to prove the feasibility. However, we are inclined to 
believe  that  quench  behavior  of  tilted  coils  will  not  differ  much  from  that  of  conventional  superconducting  magnets  using 
similar conductors.  

An elegant method is suggested to prove that a wire-wound tilted coil magnet has a generalized cosine-theta distribution of 
axial  current  density  and,  therefore,  perfectly  uniform  transverse  magnetic  field  over  the  whole  bore.  An  exact  solution  for 
current density distribution within an elliptic disk of a tilted Bitter coil is given along with an efficient method of magnetic field 
calculation. Advantages and benefits from the use of tilted coil magnets are discussed.

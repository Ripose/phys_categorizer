ABSTRACT 

The fracture of carbon nanotubes is studied by atomistic simulations. The fracture behavior is 
found to be almost independent of the separation energy and to depend primarily on the inflection 
point  in  the  interatomic  potential.  The  range  of  fracture  strains  compares  well  with  experimental 
results,  but  the  predicted  range  of  fracture  stresses  is  markedly  higher  than  observed.  Various 
plausible  small-scale  defects  do  not  suffice  to  bring  the  failure  stresses  into  agreement  with 
available experimental results. As in the experiments, the fracture of carbon nanotubes is predicted 
to be brittle. The results show moderate dependence of fracture strength on chirality.  

1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 
We  report  here  molecular  mechanics  and  molecular  dynamics  studies  of  the  failure  of 
nanotubes. Nanotubes, since their discovery in 1991[1], have attracted much interest because of their 
ability to sustain large deformations and their great stiffness and possible high strength. The ability 
of carbon nanotubes to sustain large bending deformations has been observed experimentally and 
verified by molecular dynamics studies[2][3][4]. Molecular dynamics studies have also replicated the 
ability of nanotubes to sustain very distorted configurations with only elastic deformations and no 
creation of atomic defects[2][3][5][6].  

Previous molecular mechanics simulations predict that ideal single-walled carbon nanotubes 
should possess extremely high tensile strengths. The strain at tensile failure has been predicted to 
be as high as ~30% for SWCNTs[7] by molecular mechanics. However, in the only experiments[8] 
reported  so  far,  the  tensile  failure  strain  is  usually  between  ~10%  to  ~13%  and  as  low  as  2%.  A 
recent study[9] of SWCNTs with the tight binding approximation describes a mechanism of defect 
nucleation  in  which  two  hexagon  pairs  are  converted,  through  a  Stone-Wales  bond  rotation,  into 
5/7/7/5 (pairs of pentagon-heptagon) defects. It was hypothesized that at high temperatures, plastic 
response  may  occur  due  to  separation  and  glide  of  these  5/7/7/5  defects  whereas  at  lower 
temperature this may result in fracture[9][10][11].  
 
Molecular  simulations  of  fracture  are  now  quite  commonplace.  The  earliest  atomistic 
simulations  of  fracture  were  reported  in  the  early  1970's[12][13][14]  and  many  materials  have  been

investigated.  Works  closely  related  to  this  are  Shenderova  et  al[15]  who  examined  the  fracture  of 
polycrystalline diamond, and Omeltchenko et al[16] who studied notched graphene. 
 
In  this  paper,  the  fracture  of  carbon  nanotubes  is  studied  by  molecular  mechanics  and 
dynamics. We show that the  experimental results of Yu et al[8] for the fracture strain and stress of 
carbon  nanotubes  can  be  reproduced  reasonably  well  by  molecular  mechanics.  Furthermore,  we 
show that some of the variability of failure strains reported by Yu et al[8] can be partially explained 
by  the  presence  of  defects  and  variations  due  to  chirality.  The  simulations  always  exhibit  brittle 
fracture, which also agrees with these experiments. 

Nanotubes are particularly attractive for studying fracture by molecular mechanics because 
they  are  single  molecules  with  all  atoms  joined  by  identical  bonds.  Thus  the  degree  of 
heterogeneity  and  variety  of  length  scales  found  in  fracture  of  most  materials  is  absent  in 
nanotubes.  The  major  defects  which  have  been  postulated  are  the  previously  mentioned  Stone-
Wales defects that are of the order of several bond lengths. In experiments performed in the TEM 
environment, it is possible for single atoms to be ejected by impact, see Smith[17] and Barnhart[18], 
but there are also small-scale defects. 
 
Of  course,  the  interpretation  of  fracture  simulations  by  atomistic  models  must  be  treated 
with care, since the reconfiguration of bonds is not treated. However, we show that for small initial 
defects,  the  fracture  strength  depends  primarily  on  the  inflection  point  of  the  interatomic  energy 
and is almost independent of the dissociation energy. Since the inflection strain occurs substantially 
before the strain associated with of bond breaking, where the formation of other bonds is expected, 
these results may give the correct picture of fracture at moderate temperatures (0 ~ 500 K ). 

 

2.  COMPUTATIONAL METHODS 
 

We  used  standard  molecular  mechanics  and  molecular  dynamics  methods.  By  molecular 
mechanics, we refer to methods where the equilibrium configuration of the model system is sought 
by minimizing the energy, which consists of the sum of the interatomic potentials minus any work 
by external forces. Such methods imply a temperature of 0 K  and cannot account for the effects of 
temperature.  In  molecular  dynamics  methods,  the  momentum  equations  are  integrated  in  time  for 
the system of atoms with interatomic forces given by the interatomic potential. Thus the effects of 
nonzero temperatures are included, although there are always limitations of such predictions due to 
the statistical nature of molecular motion for systems of bonded atoms. 

The interatomic bonds in nanotubes are hybridized 

2sp  bonds. In most of our calculations, 
the  interatomic  potential  used  is  a  modified  Morse  potential  function  in  which  a  bond  angle-
bending is added

This  choice  of  parameters  corresponds  to  a  separation  (dissociation)  energy  of  124Kcal/mole 
(5.62eV/atom). This is the usual Morse[19] potential except that the angle-bending energy has been 
added and the constants are slightly modified so that it corresponds with the Brenner potential for 
strains below 10%. 

The bond angle-bending potential does not contribute to the stretching energy. It is added to 
stabilize the molecular structure in the tubular configuration. Without a bond angle-bending energy, 
a stable configuration cannot be found for the nanotube. Instead, it tends to collapse onto itself. So 
the bond angle potential plays an essential role in establishing an equilibrium configuration of the 
nanotube; however, it has little effect on fracture. 

The  Brenner  function[19]  is  considered  more  accurate  and  is  more  versatile  (it  can  handle 
bond hybridization and bonds with atoms other than carbon) than the Morse potential for carbon. It

the force curve), which rises sharply with a peak at around 30% strain. This strange feature in the 
force is a result  of the cutoff in the switching function on the interatomic potential. Shenderova, et 
al[15] also noted this behavior and shifted the switching function to larger strains (specific values are 
not given) so that it occurs after the inflection point in the interatomic potential. We have found that 
the cutoff affects fracture behavior even when it is shifted to 100% strain.

The  average  Young's  modulus  and  Poisson’s  ratio  n   for  the  nanotube  with  the  modified 
Morse  potential  function  in  the  range  of  0  to  10%  strain  are  0.94 TPa   and  0.29.  They  are 
comparable to those of the Brenner potential function which are 1.07 TPa  and 0.19[3]. The nanotube 
is  quite  nonlinear  for  strains  on  the  order  of  10%.  Therefore,  for  preciseness  we  specify  both  the 
tangent modulus at 0% strain and the secant moduli. The tangent modulus is 1.16 TPa , the secant 
moduli at 5% and 10% strains are 0.89 TPa  and 0.77 TPa , respectively. Van Lier et al[20] obtained

precision, so some of the experimental scatter may be due to different strain levels. The separation

Certain qualitative and quantitative features of the interatomic force curve play key roles in 
fracture behavior. The strain at which the tensile force achieves its peak will be called the inflection 
strain since it corresponds to an inflection point in the potential. The interatomic force at this point 
will  be  called  the  peak  force.  The  strain  at  which  the  tensile  force  vanishes  is  called  the  bond-
breaking strain. The separation or bond-breaking energy (also called the dissociation energy) is the 
area  under  the  force-strain  curve  (multiplied  by  the  initial  length),  and  it  also  corresponds  to  the 
change in the potential. 

 
3. RESULTS 
 

In  the  experiments  of  Yu  et  al[8],  arc-grown  multi-walled  nanotubes  were  used.  The 
experimental setup is shown in Fig.  2.  The  multi- walled nanotubes are attached to opposing AFM 
cantilever  tips  by  a  solid  carbonaceous  material  deposited  onto  the  tips.  In  most  cases,  only  the 
outer  nanotube  was  attached  to  the  cantilever.  The  multi- walled  nanotubes  failed  in  a  sheath- like 
pattern  with  typically  only  the  outer  nanotube  failing.  Therefore,  only  the  outer  nanotube  was 
modeled  in  these  studies.  Any  interactions  of  the  outer  nanotube  with  the  inner  tubes  were 
neglected.

around the circumference, and 24,000 atoms along the length, which corresponds to a total of 4.3 
million atoms. The largest outer nanotube consisted of approximately 53.8 million atoms. Treating 
so  many  atoms  would  entail  very  long  computations,  so  most  of  our  studies  were  conducted  on 
smaller  models.  In  the  initial  simulations,  a  [20,  0]  zig- zag  tube  (the  tube  is  labeled  by  the  usual 
2n ][23]), consisting of 840 atoms were considered. The dimensions were: radius:

We  first  considered  molecular  mechanics  simulations.  A  single  bond  at  the  center  of  the 
tube  was  weakened  by  10%  in  all  molecular  mechanics  simulations  except  where  noted.  The 
motivation  for  weakening  one  bond  is  that  the  nanotube  is  a  multi-atom molecule and few defects 
are  known  that  could  serve  as  a  nucleation  site  for  the  crack  (except  for  the  Stone-Wales 
dislocation[4] which we consider later). Since the nanotube is a single molecule, there is no reason 
for  weakening  one  bond  if  we  were  only  interested  in  zero-temperature  behavior.  However,  our 
objective is to ascertain room temperature behavior where the velocities of the atoms are random 
and nonzero. The kinetic energy of these atoms follows a Boltzmann distribution, and thus as the 
potential  energy  nears  the  inflection  point  due  to  the  applied  force,  some  bonds  will  be  stretched 
beyond the point of maximum force. We mimic this by the 10% imperfection.  

One  end  of  the  nanotube  was  axially  displaced  so  that  the  nanotube  was  stretched.  The 
applied force is computed by summing the interatomic forces for the atoms along the edge where 
the  displacement  is  prescribed.  Instead  of  reporting  a  deflection  and  force,  we  report  strain  and a 

nominal  stress.  The  strain  is  given  by

length  of  the  nanotube,  respectively.  The  stress  is  calculated  from  the  cross-sectional  area  S

(
graphite, 0.34nm).

For the Brenner potential, the nanotube in the numerical simulation failed at an elongation 
of 28%[2] and the tensile strength was 110 GPa . This agrees with the results of Campbell et al[7] but 
does not agree with the Yu et al[8] experiments, where  most of the samples failed between 10% and 
13% strain (one is as low as 2%) and the tensile strengths range from 11 GPa  to 63 GPa . From our 
studies, we inferred that the high fracture strain can be attributed to the camel-back in the Brenner 
potential due to the cutoff in the switching function mentioned in the previous section.

With  the  modified  Morse  potential  function,  these  numerical  simulations  give  a  failure 
strain of 15.7% and a failure stress of 93.5 GPa . The normalized stress-strain results along with the 
experimental  results  of  Yu  et  al[8]  are  shown  in  Fig.  3.  As  can  be  seen,  the  failure  strain  is 
somewhat  greater  than  the  highest  experimental  value,  while  the  failure  stress  is  significantly 
higher. The computed stress-strain curve exhibits a sudden drop in stress at failure, so the fracture 
can  be  considered  brittle.  Yu's  experiments  also  show  brittle  fracture,  for  the  reported  force 
continues to increase until the final measurement. Young’s modulus for these experimental records 
is  significantly  below  those  previously  reported  (see  beginning  of  this  section).  It  is  possible  that 
some slippage occurred at the attachments for the high strain cases reported in Yu et al[8], resulting 
in a decrease in the measured values of Young’s modulus.

To get better insight into the relationship between fracture and separation energy, we varied 
the separation energy for the Morse function but kept the inflection point (i.e the maximum of the 
interatomic force) unchanged. For this purpose, we used linear approximations to the Morse force

field after 19% strain as shown in Fig. 4. Often it has been noted that potential functions are quite 
well described using universal functions such as Rydberg[24][25] and Morse[26] functions, for which 
the  location  of  the  inflection  point  and  the  separation  energy  are  strongly  connected.  This  means 
that  realistic  potential  functions  are  a  good  deal  less  flexible  than  we  have  assumed  in  Fig.  4. 
However,  although  there  may  be  some  relationship  between  separation  energy  and  the  inflection 
point, we doubt it is as strong as indicated in the preceding, for there would then be no need for first 
principle models.

Table 1 gives the failure strains of the nanotube for different separation energies. As before, 
one end was displaced axially to stretch the nanotube. In addition to the Morse potential in which 
the  inflection  point  (i.e.  the  peak  force)  occurs  at  19%  strain,  we  considered  a  potential  with  the 
inflection  point  at  13%  strain.    The  temperature  was  considered  to  be  K0 .  It  can  be  seen  from 
Table 1 that the failure strain depends very little on the separation energy but is strongly dependent 
on  the  location  of  the  inflection  point.  The  studies  for  19%  inflection  point  were  repeated  for  a 
[60,0]  nanotube  (separation  energy  of  124  Kcal/mole)  to  check  the  effect  of  nanotube  size.  The 
failure strain and stress were almost identical. Fig. 5 shows the evolution of the crack in the tube. It 
can be seen that the bond-breaking spreads sideways after the initially weakened bond fails.  

 

Fig. 5.  Evolution of the crack in the nanotube 
 

According  Table  1,  the  failure  strains  are  about  15.5%  for  a  large  range  of  separation 
energies  with  the  inflection  at  19%  strain. This  failure strain  of  the  nanotube  is  smaller  than  the 
strain  at  which  a  single  interatomic force  achieves  its  peak,  19%.  This  can  be  explained  by  the 
hexagonal molecular structure of the  nanotube. As a consequence of the structure of the bonds, the 

 

7 

 

strains in the longitudinal interatomic bonds are larger than the average strain in the nanotube. For 
an inflection point of 13%, the failure strains are around 10.8%. The ratio of the failure strain to the 
inflection  strain  (10.6%/13%)  is  almost  identical  to  the  other  case  (15.2%/19%).  The  simulations 
show that the failure strain of the nanotube is essentially independent of the separation energy and 
depends primarily on the inflection point of  the interatomic potential.  
 
We  have  considered  a  large  range  of  separation  energies  because  the  potential  energy 
function  is  highly  uncertain for strains beyond the inflection point, and we want to show that the 
results  are  not  dependent  on  the  separation  energy.  The  simple  interatomic  potential  used  here  is 
certainly not capable of describing the proper behavior of the system when bonds are broken, and 
2sp  bond in a carbon nanotube can result in a variety of phenomena that go 
indeed, breaking of the 
beyond what our model can do. For example, new bonds should form between the dangling orbital 
in  the  carbons  at  the  edge  of  the  fracture  region[27],  probably  with  rehybridization,  and  structural 
transformations like the Stone-Wales transformation can take place in rings near the edge so as to 
seal the end of the fractured tube. Some of these phenomena will depend on the surroundings of the 
carbon nanotube, and temperature is also expected to play a role. Thus if fracture strength depended 
strongly  on  the  separation  energy,  it  would  not  be  reasonable  to  model  fracture  with  molecular 
mechanics.  Fortunately,  our  results  show  a  very  weak  dependence  of  fracture  strain  on  the 
separation  energy,  so  the  shape  of  the  potential  surface  after  the  inflection  point  cannot  be 
important to fracture behavior. 
 
As  mentioned  in  the  introduction,  single  atom  may  be  ejected  from  the  nanotube  in  the 
TEM environment, so we simulated this situation by removing a single atom and the three bonds, 
which include this atom. For the nanotube with one missing atom at the center, the failure strain is 
10%  while  failure  stress  is  74 GPa .  For  the  standard  124Kcal/mole  separation  energy,  the 
normalized force-deflection curve for the zig- zag nanotube with one missing atom is shown in Fig. 
3.  The  force-deflection  curve  is  almost  unchanged  until  fracture.  However,  fracture  occurs  at  a 
much lower stress and strain. The fracture strain is now below the most commonly observed values, 
whereas the fracture stress is still greater than all observed values. 

We next examine the effect of the chirality on the fracture strain. Yu et al[8]  were not able to 
measure the chirality of the outermost nanotubes, so we cannot compare the effect to experiments. 
We ran three simulations in addition to the zig- zag nanotube: 

1.  [12,12] armchair nanotube 
2.  [16,8] chiral nanotube 
3.  [16,4] chiral nanotube

Fig. 6 shows the crack evolution for the nanotube, showing that the bonds nearest to parallel 
 
with the axis are the ones that break. The computed force-deflection curves are shown in Fig. 7. It 
can be seen that the calculations predict a significant dependence on the chirality of the nanotube 
on  the  strength.  The  computed  failure  strain  of  the  [12,12]  armchair  nanotube  is  18.7%,  and  the 
failure strength is 112 GPa . Thus the armchair nanotube is stronger than the zig- zag nanotube, and 
the strength of the [16,8] nanotube (17.1% failure strain and 106 GPa  failure stress) is between the 
two.

In order to ascertain the appropriateness of  weakening a bond in the molecular mechanics 
studies,  we  made  several  molecular  dynamics  simulations  without  any  weakened  bonds. For a

The  modified  Morse  potential  with  an  inflection  point  at  19%  strain  and  124Kcal/mole 
separation  energy  was  used  to  make  a  simulation  at  a  temperature  of  300 K .  The  Yu  et  al[8] 
experiments  were  completely  static  in  a  mechanical  sense:  the  loads  were  applied  over  several 
minutes  while  the  lowest  period  of  the  free-free  nanotube  (length  =  4.24 nm )  is  estimated  to  be 
0.21 ps . In molecular dynamics simulations of essentially static phenomena, a common hazard is 
that if the loading (or prescribed displacement) is applied too quickly, stress wave-like phenomena 
occur  with  considerable  overshoot  in  interatomic  forces.  These  can  lead  to  spurious  fracture.

Applying  the  prescribed  displacement  from  zero  to  the  failure  strain  in  a  molecular  dynamics 
simulation without inducing spurious fracture is proved to be too expensive. Therefore we ran the 
simulation as follows: 

1.  a molecular mechanics simulation was used to bring the nanotube to 12% tensile strain. 
2.  the velocities due to temperature were applied to the atoms and the model was brought 
to  steady-state  by  integrating  the  momentum  equations  for  the  atoms  in  time  (steady-
state is often called equilibrium). 

3.  the  displacements  at  the  end  were  prescribed  to  provide  an  extensional  strain  rate  of   

0.0072/ps. 

In molecular dynamics simulations, the location of the crack was quite arbitrary and varied 
from simulation  to simulation, but the scatter in the fracture strength was quite small. The nanotube 
failed at 16.1% – 0.2% strain at a stress of 94 GPa . This compares quite well with the 15.8% strain 
and  93.5 GPa   stress  obtained  from  the  molecular  mechanics  simulation  with  a  10%  weakened 
bond.

One  topological  defect  which  has  recently  been  identified  theoretically  is  the  5/7/7/5 
defect[10]. This defect corresponds to a 90 deg rotation of a C-C bond about its center as shown in 
Fig. 8, and is called a Stone-Wales transformation[4]. It results in two pentagons and two heptagons 
coupled in pairs. To study the effect of this defect on the behavior of the nanotube, we simulated a 
single  defect  at  the  center  of  the  [12,12]  armchair  nanotube  by  molecular  dynamics.  The 
displacement  was  prescribed  at  the  end  of  the  nanotube  and  the  124  Kcal/mole  modified  Morse 
potential was used. The failure strain is 14.3% and the failure stress is 97.5 GPa . Compared to the 
armchair nanotube with a weakened bond shown in Fig. 7, the 5/7/7/5 dislocation gives a somewhat 
lower failure strain and lower tensile strength. The fracture is still brittle. 

The study of the 5/7/7/5 defect was repeated with an [40,40] armchair nanotube. In this case 
the failure strain of the tube is 14.2% and the fr acture is still brittle. So the size of the nanotube has 
little effect on the strength. Fig. 9 shows that for the 5/7/7/5 dislocation, the maximum shear strain 

occurs in the 

direction[10] . Thus the cracks grow in the direction of maximum shear.

4. CONCLUSIONS 

 
It has been shown that some salient features of fracture behavior, i.e its brittle character and 
the magnitudes of fracture strains, of carbon nanotubes can be explained by atomistic simulations. 
In these simulations, the ranges of failure strains correspond roughly to observed values. However, 
the predicted fracture stresses are too large, even when defects are included. It was shown that the 
fracture  strain  of  extremely  homogeneous  systems  with  covalent  bonds,  such  as  the  carbon 
nanotube,  appears  to  be  driven  primarily  by  the  inflection  point  in  the  interatomic  potential.  The 
separation (dissociation) energy has little effect on the fracture strain. 

Various  nanotube  chiralities  were  studied.  Chirality  appears  to  have  a  moderate effect on 
the strength of nanotubes, with the failure stress varying from 93.5 GPa to 112 GPa  and the failure 
strain from 15.8% to 18.7%. In all cases the fracture was predicted to be brittle, which agrees with 
experiments. 

Because  of  the  homogeneity  of  multi- atom  molecules  such  as  the  nanotube,  defects  for 
nucleating  a  fracture  are  not  immediately  apparent.  To  provide  a  nucleation  site  for  a  crack  in 
molecular simulations, we reduced the strength of a single bond. Our motivation is that when the 
nanotube  is  near  failure  at  a  nonzero  temperature,  because  of  the  statistical  distribution  of 
velocities,  some  atoms  would  pass  beyond  the  inflection  point.  This  approach  was  verified  by 
molecular dynamics studies. We also studied the effects of missing atoms and 5/7/7/5 defects. The 
latter  have  small  effects  on  strength.  Missing  atoms  have  significant  effects  on  strength,  but  the 
failure  strain  also  decreases  quite  a  bit,  so  the  computed  failure  strains  then  underestimate  the  
experimental results.  

The  application  of  atomistic  models  of  active  bonds  such  as  carbon  must  generally  be 
treated with caution. However, the great insensitivity of the results to dissociation energies provides 
some  confidence  that  these  models  can  be  used  for  fracture  studies  of  nanotubes  in  a  variety  of 
situations.

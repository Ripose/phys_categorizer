Abstract 
 
Recently  Van  Flandern  concluded  from  astrophysical  data  that  gravity  propagates  faster  than  light.  We 
demonstrate that the data can be explained by current theory that does not permit superluminal speeds. We explain 
the origin of apparently instantaneous connections, first within EM, and then within strong-field GR. 

 

Introduction 
 
Van Flandern [1] draws attention to astrophysical data that apparently support the conclusion that gravitational 
influences propagate at superluminal speeds. His main argument, in general terms, is that light propagation from a 
star  is  not  collinear  with  its  gravitational  force.  He  correctly  infers  that  this  is  because  light  suffers  aberration, 
whereas gravity does not. The absence of the latter motivates his conclusion.  
 
In the first section we discuss the related example of the electric field of a uniformly moving charge source. We 
show how this field, though composed of entirely retarded influences obeying Maxwell’s equations, will accelerate a 
remote test charge towards the instantaneous position of the source. In the second section we discuss the analogous 
problem  in  GR.  On  the  basis  of  the  similarities  between  EM  and  GR,  we  argue  that  a  similar  result  can  be 
anticipated, for which the detailed calculation is given in an appendix. That section is concluded with an illustration 
of the application of the theory to astrophysical data offered by Van Flandern.

That is, the current field at time t depends on the position of the source at a previous time, where the delay is equal 
to  the  time  it  takes  light  to  traverse  that  distance  (from  the  historical  position  of  the  source).  We  draw  attention 
especially to the presence of two retarded terms in the numerator, giving rise to the interpretation of the final field as 
the result of two different, retarded, fields, E(x,t) = E1(x,t) + E2(x,t):

If  only  E1(x,t)  is  retained,  it  is  easy  to  see  that  the  electric  force  on  a  test  charge  would  be  oriented  towards  the 
historical position of the source. I.E. it would be aberrated. One might then be able to take the view that the force is 
due to a flux of particles emitted at the speed of light, exchanging momentum with the test charge.  
 
Apparent cancellation of retarded effects 
Since β < 1, the second term may be regarded as a correction to the first. As pointed out in [2], [3], and [4], its 
 
magnitude and direction are exactly that required to cancel the aberration as we now show. Combining Eqs. (2) and 
(3), the numerator of Eq. (1) can be written:

which is sufficient to prove the claim. Note that this result depends on the fact that the source is in uniform motion. 
To  complete  the transformation we will also compute the denominator in the new co-ordinates. Using Eq. (5), we

where φ is the angle between the trajectory of the source and the instantaneous line of sight (see Fig. 1), and we have

This result proves the claim above that the electric field from a uniformly moving source is not aberrated. The 
force on a test charge is directed towards the instantaneous – not the retarded - position of the source. The factor in 
braces  affects  the  magnitude,  but  not  the  direction,  of  the  field.  When  the  source  is  viewed  from  a  line  of  sight 
perpendicular to its trajectory, then the amplitude of the field is greater than that of the static charge by a factor γ. 
But viewed from a line of sight along the trajectory, the amplitude is reduced by a factor γ-2. The effects of both non-
retardation and the angular dependence of the strength of the force due to a moving source are illustrated in Fig. 2. 
Therein, the density of the field lines signifies the strength of the field, and the direction of the field lines is that of 
the force experienced by a stationary test charge.

The fact that there are two mathematical presentations of the same result, Eqs. (1) and (9), can give rise to two 
 
different  interpretations  of  the  same  phenomenon.  But  since  they  are  built  upon  the  same  theory,  these  two 
interpretations are not experimentally distinguishable. Motivated by Eq. (1), one can insist that all influences travel 
at  light  speed,  and  that  the  final  direction  of  the  force  toward  the  unretarded  position  is  the  result  of  a  fortuitous 
cancellation between the two retarded influences identified in Eq. (4). Alternatively, Eq. (9) may be used to justify 
the  viewpoint  that  there  is  no  propagation,  since  nowhere  do  retarded  co-ordinates  appear, and that the result is a 
manifestation of an important principle, and presumably could therefore have been derived more directly [5]. 
 
Propagation 
  When the charge source is accelerated, Eq. (2) does not hold, invalidating the steps leading to Eq. (9). Further, 
the electric field acquires additional terms that depend on the acceleration directly. Altogether, this means that the 
force on a test charge is not, in general, directed toward an accelerating source, and the effects of retardation are then 
readily apparent.

Observable  propagation  delays  are  illustrated  by  the  example  in  Fig.  3  wherein  a  charge  initially  in  uniform 
motion  is  abruptly  brought  to  rest.  Notice  that  the  field  lines  are  updated  by  a  shockwave  traveling  at  speed  c. 
Within  a  radius  r  <  ct,  the  charge  sprouts  new  field  lines.  Beyond  that  radius  (r  >  ct),  the  field  lines  appear  to 
emanate  from  a  source  location  that  the  charge  does  not  occupy.  The  shockwave  at  r  =  ct  carries  energy  and 
momentum, and is a manifestation of radiation. More generally: curved field lines and radiation are generated and 
propagate  whenever  there  is  a  departure  from  uniform  motion  (of  either  source  or  observer).  Otherwise,  if  the 

 

3 

motion  has  been  uniform  for  some  period  τ,  say,  then  the  field  lines  within  the  radius  r < cτ  are  straight  and 
terminate on the instantaneous position of the source. 

 

  

 

Role of the potentials in the cancellation of retarded effects 
 
There is nothing in GR that corresponds exactly to the electric field of EM. But there is a close correspondence 
between the scalar potentials of both theories [6]. Therefore, to determine the degree to which the non-propagating 
aspect of EM applies to GR, we need to determine the relative importance of the scalar potential - versus the vector 
potential - in establishing this result. In terms of the potentials, the electric field is

Recalling  the  decomposition  of  the  electric  field  as  expressed  in  Eq.  (4),  one  could  be  forgiven  for  thinking  that 
perhaps  E1(x,t)  and  E2(x,t)  correspond  respectively  to  -∇φ  and  –(1/c)∂A/∂t.  However,  this  turns  out  not  to  be  the 
case as can be seen from the following argument. For a point source, the Liénard-Wiechert potentials are

where the dependence of the denominator on x and the present time can be found from Eq. (8): 
(

 
(12) 
Given  the  co-occurrence  of  β  with  ct  in  this  expression,  and  the  dependence  of  A on  ββββ as given in Eq. (11), it is 
readily deduced that the contribution to the electric field from the time derivative of the vector potential is of order 
β2  or  higher  and  cannot  therefore  play  a  role  at  low  velocities.  It  follows  that  the  gradient  of  the  scalar  potential 
alone gives the correct electric field up to and including terms of order ββββ. This means that, to that order, the direction 
of the electric force towards the instantaneous position of the source may be regarded entirely as a property of the 
form of the scalar potential. I.E. from Eq. (12), to order  ββββ: σ = s(t), and so φ  = -e/|x – ctββββ| + O(β2). Thus, to this 
order, one finds that the Coulomb potential is as if not retarded, and

Hence,  a  shorthand  description  valid  only  to  order  ββββ  is  that  the  Coulomb  potential  is  not  retarded,  from  which  it 
follows that the force is directed towards the instantaneous position of the source. The more accurate description, as 
shown  in  detail  above,  is  that  the  scalar  potential  computed  from  solving  Maxwell’s  equations  is  retarded.  But  it 
does  not  have  the  form  one  might  naively  expect;  it  is  not  a  retarded  version  of  the  Coulomb  potential.  I.E. 
φ  ≠ -e/|x - ctretββββ|, since this is not a solution of Maxwell’s equations. Instead, φ = -e/|x - ctββββ| + O(β2) is the solution 
of Maxwell’s equations. Comparing Eqs. (9) and (13), it follows that at low velocities, the vector potential plays no 
role in establishing the non-propagating electric force.

Acceleration due to a moving source mass 
 
A form analogous to Eq. (10) can be found for the proper acceleration attributable to gravity [7]. Unlike the EM 
case however, there is no exact cancellation of the effects of retardation to all orders of β, but only cancellation up to 
terms linear in ββββ. In the linearized weak-field limit, cancellation to this order can be anticipated from the EM case on 
the  basis  of  the  correspondence  between  the  gravitational  and  electromagnetic  scalar  potentials.  Both  obey  wave 
equations, and under the circumstances of interest here, the sources of both may be idealized as structureless points. 
Hence  both  gravitational  and  electromagnetic  scalar  potentials  fall  off  as  1/r  when  the  sources  are  static.  But  the 
correspondence cannot be perfect because mass-energy – unlike charge – is not independent of velocity. This causes 
the two theories to diverge at the order of β2. From these observations, one can infer that GR should be in agreement 
with  EM  at  least  up  to  terms  linear  in  ββββ,  and,  with  reference  to  the  above  discussion  of  Eq.  (13),  that  this 
correspondence  can  be  established  solely  from  consideration  of  the  gravitational  scalar  potential.  In  other  words, 
without any analysis, one can anticipate that Newton’s law of gravity  - unretarded – is accurate up to terms linear in 
β.β.β.β. The details are worked out in the appendix, where it is established that the proper acceleration in the weak field 
limit is

It  turns  out  that  not  only  the  linearized  weak  field  limit,  but  also  the  full  moving  Schwarzschild  solution  to  the 
Einstein equations gives an acceleration towards the instantaneous position of the source (mass M0), correct to order 
ββββ. From the appendix, the result is

The  steps  leading  to  these  solutions  involve  computing  derivatives  of  time-retarded  potentials,  just  as  for  the  EM 
case. Yet the result to this order is the same: the r/r3 force law remains unchanged and unretarded if the source is 
moving.

Solar Eclipse 
 
Van Flandern offers several astrophysical situations in support of his conclusion that the speed of gravity >> c. 
Rather than attempt to address all of them in this letter, we have chosen to discuss just one in detail. Hopefully it 
will be clear how the analysis can be extended to cover his other examples.

The  situation  during  a  solar  eclipse  is  depicted  in  Fig.  4,  wherein  all  motion  is  relative  to  the  earth.  Van 
 
Flandern points out that there are two events that happen around the same time. The first event is when the moon 
crosses the path of radiation from the sun to the earth, as depicted in Fig. 4a. This is the time that the sun is eclipsed 
as  seen  from  the  earth.  But  the  line  of  sight  of  the  sun  is  not  the  same  as  the  line  from  the  earth  to  the  current 
position  of  the  sun  because  of  the  time  delay  of  light  propagation.  The  angle  α  between  the  two  -  the  aberration 
angle - is approximately given by the ratio v

Sometime ∆t later the sun, moon and earth line up (conjunct), as depicted in Fig. 4b. The time of this second event 
can be calculated by noting that the time it takes for the moon to traverse the angle an angle α + δ is equal to the 
time it takes the sun to traverse δ :

Using the ratio of the two frequencies = 13.4 (the number of lunar months per year), the time interval between the 
two events is 40.2 seconds. Van  Flandern  points  out  that  observations  indicate  that  the  acceleration  of  the  earth 
toward the sun is maximal at around 40 seconds after the sun is eclipsed and therefore this is the time of maximal 
gravitational attraction. From this he infers that the speed of gravity must be much faster than light. 
The  theoretical  explanation  of  this  observation  is  as  follows.  Sunlight  is  electromagnetic  radiation  due 
 
(classically)  to  the  acceleration  of  charges  in  the  sun.  Such  radiation  suffers  a  propagation  delay  as  illustrated  in 
Fig. 3,  and  is  therefore  aberrated.  By  contrast,  gravitational  radiation  due  to  the  earth’s  acceleration  is  negligible, 
leaving  only  the  linear  aspect  of  the  relative  sun-earth  motion  to  consider.  Since  v⊕/c  <<  1,  the  results  of  the 
previous  section  apply,  and  one  concludes  that  the  gravitational  force  on  the  earth  is  directed  towards  the 
instantaneous position of the sun; i.e. is not aberrated.  
 
Generalization 
From this example we can draw a more general conclusion that applies to Van Flandern’s other data. Noticing 
 
that  separated  aggregates  of  matter  tend  to  be  electrically  neutral,  one  concludes  that  the  predominant 
electromagnetic force in astrophysics will be due to radiation (in the far-field) - the non-radiative (near-field) force 
between charged bodies predominates only at a very small scale. In contrast, because gravity is always attractive, the 
non-radiative  force  does  not  disappear  between  aggregates  of  matter.  The  force  of  gravitational  radiation  is 
comparatively  negligible,  and  therefore  the  predominant  gravitational  force  in  astrophysics  will  be  non-radiative 
(near-field). Hence, though the qualities of propagation and non-propagation of the far and near fields respectively 
are  the  same  for  both  EM  and  GR,  the  dominance of radiative EM interactions and non-radiative GR interactions 
explains the asymmetry of influences in this and other examples.  
 
Conclusion 
 
Van  Flandern  is  correct  in  his  observation  that  gravitational  attraction  is  directed  towards  the  instantaneous 
(unretarded) position of a moving body. We have shown that this fact can be explained without a revision of physics 
to include superluminal propagation.

Appendix 
Gravitational force on a static test particle due to a moving source 

 
This appendix is in two sections. In the first section a 3-vector form of the geodesic equation is presented for a 
test mass initially at rest and solely under the influence of a gravitational field via the metric. In the second section 
the  problem  is  solved  for  a  gravitational  field  of  arbitrary  strength  using  the  Schwarzschild  metric  for  a  moving 
source.

Expressed in this way, the geodesic equation takes on the appearance of Newton’s second law, where the expression 
on the right-hand side is a driving force attributable to the gravitational field. Møller [7] noted the similarity between

and  accordingly  defined a gravitational scalar and vector potential. Forward [8] subsequently pursued this idea by 
identifying  a  magnetic-like  component  of  force  on  a  moving  test  body.  However,  as  admitted  by  Forward,  the 
correspondence  between  GR  and  EM  is  only  approximate.  In  EM,  conservation  of  electric charge, expressed as a

Consequently  care  should  be  exercised  in  attempting  to  draw  EM-inspired  conclusions  from  Eq.  (A4),  even  when 
the test body is static. For this reason, we do the analysis, rather than assume that the electromagnetic result (that the 
force on a uniformly moving test body points to the instantaneous position of the source) applies to gravity.

These expressions may be inserted into the right hand side of Eq. (A4) to obtain an exact closed form expression for 
the force. However, we already know in advance that since the weak field force is not directed towards the source (if 
terms  beyond  those  linear  in  β2  are  significant)  then  under  the  same  conditions  the  exact  (strong  field)  solution 
cannot be directed towards the source either. The only remaining interest then is to determine if the force is directed 
toward the source for all strengths of field up to and including linear terms in ββββ. Rewriting the equation of motion 
(A4) as

i.e., for small velocities, the force depends only on the (gradient of the) scalar gravitational potential, and not on the 
‘gravitational vector potential’. To compute the gradient of g00, first note that

One  can  argue  in  favor  of  this  finding  solely  on  the  basis  of  time  symmetry  as  follows.  Maxwell’s 
equations alone are time symmetric. The Newton-Lorentz equation of motion for a classical massive charge 
under  the  influence  of  Maxwell  fields  becomes  the  Lorentz-Dirac  equation  upon  addition  of  the 
phenomenologically-motivated radiation-reaction term, which destroys the time symmetry. But this term is 
non-zero  only  when  there  are  accelerations  (jerk  ultimately demands that an acceleration is also present). 
When  the  velocity  is  constant,  there  is  no  radiation,  no  radiation  reaction,  and  time-symmetry  is  then 
present both in the Maxwell equations for the fields, and the Lorentz-Dirac equation for the sources. In that 
case, the motion must be time reversible. It follows immediately that the force cannot preferentially point 
toward an historical (i.e.: retarded) as opposed to future (i.e.: advanced) position. 

B. Haisch – private communication - independently realized that the correspondence between EM and GR 
scalar potentials is a sufficient basis to refute Van Flandern’s thesis.

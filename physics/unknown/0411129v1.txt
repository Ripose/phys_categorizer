Abstract 

 
General relativity predicts a “hyperfine” precession rate for a gyroscope moving 
in  the  gravitomagnetic  field  of  a  rotating  massive  body.  The  recently  launched 
Gravity  Probe  B  (GP-B)  will  test  the  predicted  precession  rate  of  40.9  milliarc-
seconds per year for a set of four gyroscopes in a Polar Earth Orbit (PEO). 
 
It may be possible, however, that the gravitomagnetic field from a rotating 
mass  behaves  in  the  same  way  as  the  magnetic  field  generated  by  a  moving 
charge. In that case the predicted precession rate of a gyroscope will be zero, since 
the gyroscopes of GP-B have been shielded against external magnetic fields. 
 
Another  possible  manifestation  of  the  equivalence  of  gravitomagnetic  and 
magnetic  field  may  already  have  been  found.  It  is  the  so-called  Wilson-Blackett 
law, approximately describing the magnetic field of many rotating celestial bodies. 
 
In this work a review of the gravitomagnetic approach is given starting from 
the Einstein equations. Four gravitomagnetic equations, analogous to the Maxwell 
equations, are deduced. The Wilson-Blackett relation follows from these equations, 
if the gravitomagnetic field is identified as a common magnetic field. 
 
In  addition,  the  precession  rate  for  a  gyroscope  in  terms  of  the  gravito-
magnetic field  has been derived, starting from the principle  of  general covariance. 
The gravitomagnetic field may again be identified as a common magnetic field, or 
can  be  evaluated  in  the  standard  way.  The  future  observations  from  GP-B  may 
discriminate between the alternative choices.

1. Introduction 
 
One  of  the  aims  of  the  Gravity  Probe  B  [1–3]  is  to  measure  the  gravitomagnetic 
precession rate of a gyroscope in a polar orbit about the Earth [4, 5]. In the framework of 
fixed stars the precession rate Ω deduced by Schiff [5] is given by 
 
 
 
 
 
2 ω is the angular momentum for a large sphere of radius r0, I is 
where S = I ω = 2/5 f m r0
its  moment  of  inertia,  ω  its  angular  velocity,  m  its  mass  and  f  is  a  dimensionless  factor 
depending  on  the  homogeneity  of  the  mass  density  in  the  sphere  (for  a  homogeneous 
mass distribution f = 1). R is the position vector from the centre of, e.g., the Earth to a 
gyroscope. For a gyroscope moving in a polar orbit 649 km above the Earth the integrated 
value of  Ω  is equal to 40.9  milliarc-seconds per year (mas/yr). The  Gravity Probe B will 
measure this effect to a precision of 1% or better [1, 3]. 
As has been discussed by Weinberg [6, chapters 5, 9], equation (1) can be derived 
 
from the equations of spin motion dictated by the principle of general covariance. Starting 
from the same principle but applying the gravitomagnetic approach, the precession rate Ω 
can also be written in terms of the so-called “magnetic-type” gravitational field B [7–9] 
 
 
 
where  β  is  a  dimensionless  constant  of  order  unity.  Note  that  the  field  B  in  (2)  has  the 
dimension  of  a  magnetic  induction  field,  but  alternative  dimensions  for  the  “magnetic-
type” gravitational field are also mathematically possible. 

Ω = – 2 β –1 c–1 G½  B,

In our version of the gravitomagnetic theory [8, 9] it is assumed that the gravito-
 
magnetic  field  B(gm)  and  an  electromagnetic  field  B(em)  due  to  moving  charge  are 
equivalent. Thus, a gyroscope surrounded by a total field B(tot) = B(gm) + B(em) cannot 
distinguish between these fields of different origin and B =  B(tot) has to be substituted 
into (2). However, the gyroscopes in the experimental set-up of GP-B have carefully been 
shielded  against  all  external  magnetic  fields  [1–3].  Then,  the  field  B(gm)  as  well  as  a 
possible  contribution  B(em)  both  due  to  the  Earth  may  be  filtered  out  and  a  precession 
rate  Ω  ≅  0  may  be  found.  Usually,  it  is  assumed,  however,  that  the  field  B(gm)  has 
properties totally different from the magnetic induction field B(em) generated by moving 
charge. In that case the standard precession rate (1) may be observed. 
 
In this work the field B(gm) for a rotating mass of electrically neutral matter, will 
separately  be  deduced,  as  previously  has  been  done  [7–9].  The  following  dipolar 
magnetic field B = B(gm) at distance R > r0 is obtained 
 
 
 
 
 
where M = M(gm) is the gravitomagnetic dipole moment given by 
 
 
 
Note that M and S possess opposite directions for the choice β = + 1. Substitution of (4) into 
(3), followed by insertion of the result into (2) yields the standard result for Ω of (1). It is 
noticed that the result (1) does not depend on the constant β. 
If the gravitomagnetic field B = B(gm) of (3) is identified as a common magnetic 
 
induction field, expression (4) represents the so-called Wilson-Blackett law. This relation 
appears to be approximately valid for many, strongly different, celestial bodies and some 
rotating metallic cylinders in the laboratory as well (see for a review [9] and references 
therein; for pulsars, see [10]). It is noticed that the values of M(obs) and S vary over the 
large  interval  of  about  sixty  decades!  The  correct  order  of  magnitude  of  the  observed 
magnetic  dipole  moment  M(obs)  compared  with  M(gm)  from  (4)  is  the  main  reason  to 
propose  that  B(gm)  from  (3)  is  equivalent  to  the  magnetic  induction  field  B(em) 
generated by moving charge. 
 
In  section  2  we  first  review  the  deduction  of  the  gravitomagnetic  field  B  of  (3), 
whereas in section 3 the precession rate Ω of (2) is derived and discussed. In section 4 the 
main results are summarized and conclusions are drawn.

The  Einstein  equations  (without  cosmological  constant)  are  the  starting  point  of  our 
gravitomagnetic approach. In this work the formalism given by Landau and Lifshitz [11, 
chapters 10–13] has been followed. The full Einstein equations are

meaning. In this work it will be assumed that a small mass density ρ moves with a low 
velocity v (v << c) through a weak gravitational field.

In  further  analogy  to  electromagnetism,  the  gravitomagnetic  field  B  may  now  be

influence of β on other formulas, the general factor β will be preserved.

and a gravitational field g from ϕ and A as 
 
 
 
 
 
Note that the fields B and g are not mutually analogous. As will be discussed below, the 
definition of B in (17) implies that gravitomagnetic monopoles do not exist. Owing to the 
definition of A in (13), the gravitomagnetic field B from (17) possesses the dimension of 
a magnetic induction field, but other choices for A or B are also possible. For example, 
Weinberg [6] choose a dimensionless vector potential ζ defined in his equation (9.1.61). It 
can be shown that the relation between the vector potentials ζ and A is given by 
 
 
 
 
the following set of four differential equations for sources in vacuum 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Especially for the choice β = + 1, the analogy between the gravitomagnetic equations (20)–
(23)  and  the  four  differential  equations  describing  electromagnetic  phenomena  and 
known  as  the  Maxwell  equations  is  striking.  In  the  static  case  (21)  and  (22)  lead  to 
Newton’s  well-known  gravitation  law.  The  striking  analogy  between  this  law  and 
Coulomb’s  law  has  been  noted  since  the  beginning  of  physics.  Therefore,  the  adopted 
analogy between the gravitational field g of (18) and the corresponding definition of the 
electric field E may also be valid. It is noticed that neither the Maxwell equations nor the 
gravitomagnetic  equations  are  completely  symmetrical.  This  asymmetry  stems  in  the 
latter case from the definition of the gravitomagnetic field B =  B(gm) in (17) implying 

From  (14)–(18),  by  making  use  of  standard  vector-analysis,  one  can  then  derive

In  the  stationary  case  the  gravitomagnetic  field  B  can  be  obtained  from  the

relation  (23).  In  the  electromagnetic  case  the  asymmetry  is  due  to  the  corresponding 
definition of the electromagnetic magnetic induction field B(em) ≡ ∇ × A(em) implying 
the Maxwell equation ∇ . B(em) = 0. 
 
The  derivation  of  Maxwell-type  gravitational  equations  has  a  long  history,  dating 
back to Heaviside already (see, e.g., [12]). A number of attempts to derive equations like 
(20)–(23)  have  been  discussed,  e.g.,  in  ref.  [9].  Deductions  of  the  gravitomagnetic 
equations  from  the  Einstein  equations  have  been  given  by  Peng  [7],  Biemond  [8,  9], 
Mashhoon [13], Pascual-Sánchez [14], Ruggiero and Tartaglia [15] and others. 
 
simplified equation (20) and (23) 
 
 
 
Since ∇ . B = 0, the field B can be derived from the vector potential A of (17). Equation 
(24) may imply that neutral matter moving either translationally or rotationally acts as a 
source  of  gravitomagnetism.  In  this  work  we  will  only  deal  with  rotationally  generated 
gravitomagnetism, implying v = ω × r (ω is the angular velocity of a mass element ρ dV 
and  r  is  the  distance  from  the  rotation  axis  to  this  mass  element).  Translationally 
generated gravitomagnetism has shortly been discussed in [9]. 
 
satisfies to (24) 
 
 
 
2 ω. In deriving (25) it has been assumed that the radius r0 
where again S = I ω = 2/5 f m r0
of the sphere is small in comparison with the distance R from the centre of the sphere to 
the  field  point  where  the  field  A  is  observed.  Utilizing  (4),  calculation  of  the  gravito-
magnetic field B from (17) yields 
 
 
 
Further  evaluation  of  (26)  yields  the  gravitomagnetic  field  of  (3).  Equation  (26) 
represents  the  field  from  the  gravitomagnetic  dipole  moment  M  =  M(gm)  of  (4).  Note 
that neither the sign nor the value of β in (4) follow from the derivation. If the field B of 
(26) may be identified as a common magnetic induction field, then equation (4) may be 
denoted as the so-called Wilson-Blackett law [9]. 
 
body and B(gm) from (4) (choosing β = + 1) is reflected by the effective parameter βeff
 
 
 
For βeff = + 1 full agreement occurs. For a series of about fourteen rotating bodies ranging 
from metallic cylinders in the laboratory to moons, planets, stars and the Galaxy an absolute 
value of βeff = 0.076 has been found from a weighted least-squares fit to the data (see for 
details ref. [9] and references therein). Likewise, for fourteen slowly rotating, accreting, X-
ray emitting, binary pulsars values of βeff lying in between 0.10 and 55 could be calculated 
[10].  Although  the  agreement  with  the  gravitomagnetic  prediction  βeff  =  1  is  only 
approximate, the found order of magnitude of βeff for so many, strongly different, rotating 
bodies may reflect the basic validity of the Wilson-Blackett law. 
 
As  pointed  out  earlier  [9],  moving  electric  charge  in  the  magnetic  field  from 
gravitomagnetic  origin  may  cause  an  additional  magnetic  field  from  electromagnetic 
origin.  Moreover,  it  is  noticed  that  the  predicted  magnetic  field  generated  by  a  rotating 
mass also bearing a charge is generally much smaller than the magnetic field generated

by  the  charge.  Therefore,  it  is  usually  extremely  difficult  to  isolate  the  gravitomagnetic 
contribution  from  an  observed  magnetic  field.  For  these  reasons,  magnetic  fields  from 
gravitomagnetic origin may have escaped detection so far. 
 
Some  remarks  with  respect  to  equation  (23)  can  be  made.  Equation  (23)  follows 
from (17), whether the gravitomagnetic field B is identified as a magnetic induction field 
or  not.  As  a  consequence  of  (23),  magnetic  monopoles  from  gravitomagnetic  origin  do 
not  exist.  Analogously,  the  Maxwell  equation  ∇ . B(em)  =  0  excludes  the  existence  of 
magnetic monopoles from electromagnetic origin. If B in (23) is equivalent to a magnetic 
induction field due to a charge, then (23) and ∇ . B(em) = 0 may explain why no magnetic 
monopoles of any kind have been detected so far. For a discussion of the present status of 
magnetic monopole research, see, e.g., Groom [16].

Utilizing  (8),  introduction  of  Aα  from  (13)  into  Γβ

 
Starting from the principle of general covariance the following equations of spin motion 
can be derived [6, chapters 5, 9] 
 
 
 
 
 
where the quantities τ, Si and Γj
ik have their usual meaning. The index i runs from 0–3, 
whereas the indices j and k are summed from 0–3. If we set i = α, multiply both sides of 
(28)  with  dτ/dt  and  eliminate  S0,  the  gravitomagnetic  contribution  can  be  separated  off 
from this equation. By considering only the terms with k = 0 in (28), one obtains

Evaluation of gβα in (30) by introduction of the scalar potential φ = – Gm/R then leads to 
the following three dimensional vector form for dS/dt (S ≡ Sx, Sy, Sz) 
 
 
 
 
 
Note  that  the  terms  on  the  right  hand  side  of  (31)  correspond  to  those  of  Weinberg  [6] 
(compare with his equation (9.6.5)). Substitution of B from (17) into (31) finally leads to 
the  following  gravitomagnetic  contribution  to  dS/dt  (the  term  in  ∂φ/∂t  in  (31)  not 
depending on A will not further be considered here)

Related derivations of (1), (2) and (32) have previously been given by Weinberg [6] 
 
and Peng [7]. An alternative way to deduce them is to start from the gravitomagnetic force 
density f [9] 
 
 
 
The  latter  equation  can  be  deduced  by  combining  (7)  and  (13).  Utilizing  (33)  and 
following the same line of reasoning given by Landau and Lifshitz [11] for the electro-
magnetic analogue, the formulas (1), (2) and (32) can be calculated [9]. 
 
If the gravitomagnetic field B = B(gm) from (3) generated by rotating, electrically 
neutral  mass  will  be  incompatible  with  a  magnetic  induction  field  B  =  B(em)  from 
electromagnetic origin, then substitution of B = B(gm) from (3) and (4) into (2) leads to 
the  standard  result  for  the  precession  rate  of  Ω  of  (1).  For  a  gyroscope  in  the  Gravity 
Probe  B  moving  in  a  649  km  orbit  above  the  Earth  (S  =  5.87×1040  g.cm2.s–1,  R  = 
7.027×108 cm) the integrated value of Ω would then be equal to the standard value of 40.9 
milliarc-seconds per year (mas/yr) [1–3]. It is noticed that within experimental accuracy the 
slight eccentricity e (e = 0.0014, see [1]) of the orbit of GP-B does not affect this result. 
 
The (absolute) value of the gravitomagnetic dipole moment M(gm) of the Earth can 
be calculated from (4). Choosing β = + 1 and substitution of S = 5.87×1040 g.cm2.s–1 into 
(4)  yields  M(gm)  =  2.53×1026  G.cm3.  The  observed  magnetic  moment  M(obs)  of  the 
Earth, however, is equal to 7.91×1025 G.cm3. Combination of (3), (4) and (27) then yields a 
value  of  0.31  for  βeff.  So,  in  this  case  circulating  charge  in  the  Earth  may  weaken  the 
magnetic field caused by gravitomagnetism. 
 
If the field B(gm) shows the same behaviour as a field B(em) generated by moving 
charge,  then  the  precession  rate  Ω  of  (2)  may  be  determined  by  the  total  magnetic 
induction  field  B(tot)  =  B(gm)  +  B(em).  The  field  B(gm)  can  be  calculated  from  a 
combination of (3) and (4). From (3) the polar field Bp(gm) at a gyroscope in the Gravity 
Probe B (R = 7.027×108 cm) can be calculated to be 1.46 G, whereas the orbital-averaged 
magnetic  field  is  equal  to  ¼  Bp(gm)  =  0.36  G.  However,  the  gyroscopes  in  the  GP-B 
experiment have been shielded against external dc magnetic fields of order 10–7 G [1–3], 
so  that  the  residual  integrated  value  for  Ω  from  (2)  could  be  equal  to  1.1×10–5  mas/yr. 
Although the accuracy of the GP-B experiment is expected to be better than 1% [1, 3], or 
0.4 mas/yr, this small value is outside observational reach. Thus, the observed precession 
rate Ω may clarify the nature of the gravitomagnetic field B(gm). 
 
A final remark may be justified here on the exact value of β. This work suggest a 
value of β = + 1 based on the discussion of (16) and the gravitomagnetic equations (20)–
(23).  In  literature  various  choices  for  the  dimensionless  constant  β  have  been  made 
implicitly. For example, Weinberg [6] applies β = + 4 (compare his equations (9.1.66) and 
(9.6.5)  with  equations  (14)  and  (31),  respectively),  Mashhoon  [13]  and  Ruggiero  and 
Tartaglia [15] use β = + 2, Peng [7] and Pascual-Sánchez [14] use β = + 1. Note that a 
negative  value  for  β  is  also  mathematically  possible.  For  example,  Heaviside  applies  a 
value of β = – 1 [12], which makes the direction of Ω with B in (2) coincide.  
 

4. Conclusions 

 
If the gravitomagnetic field B = B(gm) from (3) generated by rotating, electrically neutral 
mass  will  be  incompatible  with  a  magnetic  induction  field  B  =  B(em)  from  electro-
magnetic  origin,  then  substitution  of  B  =  B(gm)  from  (3)  and  (4)  into  (2)  leads  to  the 
standard result for the precession rate Ω of (1). For a gyroscope in the Gravity Probe B 
moving in a 649 km orbit above the Earth (S = 5.87×1040 g.cm2.s–1, R = 7.027×108 cm) 
the integrated value of Ω would then be equal to 40.9 mas/yr [1–3]. 
The alternative gravitomagnetic precession rate Ω of (2) may also be deduced from 
 
general relativity. If the gravitomagnetic field B = B(gm) of (3) from gravitational origin

behaves  like  a  magnetic  induction  field  from  electromagnetic  origin,  B(em),  then  the 
precession rate Ω of (2) will be determined by the total magnetic induction field B(tot) = 
B(gm) + B(em). However, the four gyroscopes in the Gravity Probe B have been shielded 
against external dc magnetic fields of order 10–7 G, so that the residual integrated value 
of  the  precession  rate  Ω  from  (2)  could  be  equal  to  1.1×10–5  mas/yr,  outside  the 
observational reach of GP-B. 
 
The  approximate  validity  of  the  so-called  Wilson-Blackett  law  (4)  for  rotating 
massive bodies [8–10] is an indication in favour for the identification of B(gm) of (3) as a 
common magnetic induction field. Discrepancies between the values of B(gm) following 
from  (4)  and  the  observed  field  B(obs)  may  be  attributed  to  interfering  effects  from 
electromagnetic origin [9, 10]. 
 
Nayeri  and  Reynolds  [17]  also  discussed  the  gravitomagnetic  precession  in  the 
context  of  the  five-dimensional  model  of  Randall  and  Sundrum.  This  model  can  be 
considered  as  an  extension  of  general  relativity.  From  the  two-brane  scenario  of  their 
model  a  value  of  4×10– 31  mas/yr  for  the  gravitomagnetic  precession  rate  Ω  can  be 
calculated,  far  outside  the  observational  reach  of  GP-B.  Note  that  all  discussed 
predictions for Ω (the standard value Ω = 40.9 mas/yr, the value Ω ≅ 0 from Nayeri and 
Reynolds [16] and our value Ω ≅ 0) start from general relativity as a basis. 
 
It  is  to  be  expected  that  the  results  of  the  Gravity  Probe  B  will  discriminate 
between  the  standard  gravitomagnetic  precession  rate  Ω  from  (1)  and  the  alternative 
predictions  Ω  ≅  0  discussed  in  this  work.  Thus,  the  true  nature  of  the  gravitomagnetic 
field B in (3) may become more manifest. If the latter field appears to be equivalent to the 
magnetic field of electromagnetic origin, then mass and charge are intimately connected 
by magnetism. Such a result would be an important step towards further unification of the 
theories of general relativity and electromagnetism (compare with, e.g., [18]).

Abstract 

Measurements  of  ions  in  atmospheric  air  are  used  to  investigate  atmospheric 

electricity  and  particulate  pollution.  Commonly  studied  ion  parameters  are  (1)  air 

conductivity,  related  to  the  total  ion  number  concentration,  and  (2)  the  ion  mobility 

spectrum, which varies with atmospheric composition. The physical principles of air 

ion  instrumentation  are  long-established.  A  recent  development  is  the  computerised 

aspirated capacitor, which measures ions from (a) the current of charged particles at a 

sensing electrode, and (b) the rate of charge exchange with an electrode at a known 

initial  potential,  relaxing  to  a  lower  potential.  As  the  voltage  decays,  only  ions  of 

higher and higher mobility are collected by the central electrode and contribute to the 

further decay of the voltage. This enables extension of the classical theory to calculate 

ion mobility spectra by inverting voltage decay time series. In indoor air, ion mobility 

spectra  determined  from  both  the  novel  voltage  decay  inversion,  and  an  established 

voltage  switching  technique,  were  compared  and  shown  to  be  of  similar  shape.  Air 

conductivities  calculated  by  integration  were:  5.3  ±  2.5  fSm-1  and  2.7  ±  1.1  fSm-1 

respectively, with conductivity determined to be 3 fSm-1 by direct measurement at a 

constant  voltage.  Applications  of  the  new  Relaxation  Potential  Inversion  Method 

(RPIM)  include  air  ion  mobility  spectrum  retrieval  from  historical  data,  and 

computation of ion mobility spectra in planetary atmospheres.

Introduction 

Atmospheric  molecular  cluster-ions  are  formed  by  natural  radioactive  isotopes  and 

cosmic rays, and are central to the electrical properties of air. The original “Gerdien 

condenser”1 aspirated capacitor is a widely used instrument for terrestrial atmospheric 

ion  measurements.  It  consists  of  a  cylindrical  outer  electrode  containing  a  coaxial 

central electrode, with a fan to draw air between the electrodes. With an appropriate 

bias voltage applied across the electrodes, a current flows which is proportional to the 

air  conductivity.  (The  “conductivity  measurement  régime”  requires  an  adequate 

ventilation speed to be maintained for the bias voltage selected; the régime’s existence 

can  be  verified  by  an  approximately  Ohmic  response  in  measured  current  to  a 

changing bias voltage). Early ion measurements inferred the air conductivity from the 

rate  of  voltage  decay  or  relaxation  across  the  electrodes,  using  a  gold-leaf  or  fibre 

electrometer2. As electronics technology developed, this technique was augmented by 

direct  measurements  of  the  current.  Sophisticated  contemporary  instruments  under 

computer  control  combine 

the  “current  measurement”  and  “voltage  decay” 

measurement modes for self-calibration3,4.  

Surface measurements with modern instrumentation suggest that, although generally 

comparable,  conductivities  from  the  two  measurement  modes  (i.e.  ion  current  and 

voltage  decay)  are  not  always  completely  consistent3.  The  study  reported  in  [3]  is 

believed  to  be  the  first  direct  comparison  of  the  two  modes,  and  motivated 

reconsideration  of 

the 

theoretical  assumptions  underlying  air  conductivity 

measurement  with  an  aspirated  capacitor  in  the  voltage  decay  mode.  This  paper

describes  a  new  technique,  the  Relaxation  Potential  Inversion  Method  (RPIM), 

enabling  ion  mobility  spectra  to  be  retrieved  from  voltage  decay  measurements. 

Improved ion measurements are needed for solar-terrestrial physics, pollution studies 

and  assessment  of 

long-term  geophysical  changes 

in  atmospheric  electrical 

parameters5.

Classical  theory  of  air  conductivity  measurement  with  an  aspirated 

The electrical conductivity of air σ is the product of air ion number concentration n, 

and ion mobility µ. The ion mobility spectrum n(µ) describes the distribution of ion 

number  concentration  with  mobility,  and  µ is  inversely  related  to  the  size  and 

molecular  mass  of  the  cluster.  Molecular  ions  with  0.5  <  µ  <  3  cm2V-1s-1  are 

conventionally  defined  as  “small  ions”,  as  their  size  is  limited  by  thermodynamic 

constraints on their lifetime, which generally inhibit ion growth to µ ~ 0.5 cm2V-1s-1 6. 

Applying these limits, the air conductivity due to positive or negative ions σ± is given 

by

where e is the charge on the electron, µ± is the positive or negative ion mobility, and 

n±(µ) the number of positive or negative ions with a given mobility. Because of the 

large differences between the mobility of small ions and aerosol particles, it is usually 

possible to assume that only small ions contribute to the conductivity, except in very 

polluted air. In this case, the lower limit of the integral can change, and intermediate 

and large ions of lower mobility may also be abundant enough to contribute7. Mohnen 

defined  the  mean  mobility µas  the  mode  of  the  ion  distribution8,  usually  1.3-1.6

cm2V-1s-1 for positive and 1.3-1.9 cm2V-1s-1 for the chemically different negative ions6. 

At  typical  ionisation  rates  of  10  cm-3s-1,  surface  continental  atmospheric  ion 

concentrations  are  ~100-2000  cm-3,  and  typical  air  conductivity  can  therefore  vary 

considerably from ~2-100 fSm-1. The determining influences on surface conductivity 

are  aerosol  pollution  number  concentrations  (aerosol  reduces  the  air  conductivity, 

except  in  highly  polluted  air)6,9  and  the  ion  production  rate  from  cosmic  rays  and 

geological sources. 

The electrical mobility of small ions and aerosol particles differ by several orders of 

magnitude,  so  it  is  usually  assumed  that  the  principal  contributions  to  the  air 

conductivity  are  from  ions  with  the  same µ, and  total  number  concentration  N.

Equation 2 

For an aspirated cylindrical capacitor operating in Current Measurement mode, with 

sufficient  ventilation  to  ensure  ions  reaching  the  central  electrode  are  constantly 

replenished, the ion current at the central electrode is proportional to the unipolar air 

conductivity. The motion of an ion in the radial electric field between the cylindrical 

capacitor’s electrodes can be used with Equation 2 to derive the conductivity due to 

positive  or  negative  ions  σ±   from  the  current  i  at  the  central  electrode  arising  from 

bias voltage V±

In  the  Voltage  Decay  mode,  the  voltage  established  across  the  capacitor  electrodes 

decays  due  to  the  current  i  flowing  through  the  air,  of  resistance  R,  Figure  1.  If  the

It is important to emphasise that the Voltage Decay and Current Measurement modes 

are fundamentally different in the mobility of ions assumed to be selected. For both 

modes,  the  ion  mobility  contributing  to  the  measurement  is  assumed  to  be  constant, 

but  the  longer  duration  required  for  Voltage  Decay  measurements  requires  the 

assumption that the mobility spectrum being sampled is constant for longer than the 

measurement  period.  If  very  long  decay  timescales  are  considered,  this  implies  that 

such  measurements  could  be  susceptible  to  temporal  or  other  fluctuations  in  ion 

mobility.  

3.  Modification to the classical theory of the Voltage Decay mode 

In calculations of the conductivity, the critical mobility µc is assumed to represent the 

minimum  mobility  of  ion  contributing  to  the  measurement10.  It  is  defined  from 

consideration of the motion of ions in the radial electric field at a ventilated capacitor 

(Figure 1)10

. For a cylindrical geometry, µc is a function of ventilation speed u, length 

L, central and outer electrode radii a and b and bias voltage V given by:

Critical mobility is a function of bias voltage, and therefore ion mobility spectra can 

be found by changing the voltage at the central electrode13. It is possible for some ions 

with  mobility  lower  than  the  critical  mobility  to  enter  the  cylindrical  capacitor,  but 

this effect is negligible except in polluted air with very high concentrations of larger 

charged  particles14.  In  this  paper  it  is  assumed  that  only  ions  with  mobility  greater 

Equation 9 

Equation 10

than  the  critical  mobility  contribute  to  the  measurements.  The  implications  of  this 

assumption will be discussed in section 5. 

During  a  Voltage  Decay  measurement,  both  the  voltage,  and  therefore  the  critical 

mobility  (Equation  9)  vary  continuously.  As  a  consequence,  the  decaying  voltage 

across  the  capacitor’s  electrodes  changes  the  mobility  distribution  of  the  ions 

contributing  to  charge  exchange.  This  modulation  of  the  ion  mobility  spectrum,  and 

therefore,  from  Equation  1,  air  conductivity,  invalidates  the  assumption  used  in  the 

derivation  of  Equation  7,  that  the  ion  spectrum  selected  for  measurement  remains 

constant.  The  behaviour  of  an  aspirated  capacitor  in  voltage  decay  mode  cannot  be 

completely described by Equation 7: in an ideal instrument, differences from Equation 

7 will arise from changes in critical mobility during the decay. 

Differences from the exponential decays predicted by Equation 7 appear detectable in 

measurements  of  voltage  decays  in  atmospheric  air,  following  a  series  of 

measurements made over several months which rarely showed the exponential decays 

expected based on classical assumptions9. Additionally, past voltage decays measured 

in the free troposphere were also non-exponential12.  Figure 2 shows exponential fits 

to typical voltage decay time series in surface atmospheric air. Natural variability in 

the measurement is expected to cause some fluctuations in the time series, particularly 

in the polluted boundary layer, but the existence of free tropospheric non-exponential 

decays  is  more  difficult  to  explain  using  the  theory  outlined  in  section  2.  Classical 

theory can be modified to account for the variation in critical mobility during voltage 

decay measurements.

4.  Computing ion spectra from voltage decay measurements 

As  conductivity  is  effectively  the  mobility  integral  over  the  ion  spectrum  (Equation 

1),  every  voltage  decay  time  series  contains,  in  principle,  ion  spectrum  information. 

The  relationship  between  voltage  decay  measurements  and  the  ion  spectrum 

information can be determined by substituting Equation 1 for the conductivity term in 

Equation  6,  and  evaluating  the  resulting  integral  in  two  parts.  The  first  part  is  with 
respect to mobility, from the maximum ion mobility in the air µm down to the critical 
mobility  evaluated  at  time  t,  µc(t).  The  second  part  is  evaluated  from  µc(t)  to  the 
critical mobility at the start of the decay µc(0), written as

voltage decays from a given ion spectrum9.

where  µc(tj)  is  the  critical  mobility  evaluated  from  the  voltage  (Equation  9)  at  each 

time j, and τj the instantaneous decay time constant. The incremental changes, ∆Ij and 

∆Mj can be evaluated for each mobility strip of width [µc(tj+1) -µc(tj-1)], with mobility 

calculated  using  Equation  9  from  V(tj+1)  and  V(tj-1).  The  ion  concentration  in  each 

mobility strip nj can then be estimated. The inversion yields a mobility spectrum with 

N-1  points  if  the  original  voltage  decay  has  N  points;  the  highest  voltage 

(corresponding  to  the  lowest  ion  mobility)  does  not  have  a  corresponding  spectral 

point  because  it  provides  the  initial  voltage  V0.  The  steps  involved  in  the  inversion 

procedure are summarised in Figure 3. 

4.2.  Numerical example with a synthetic ion spectrum 

A numerical example demonstrates the inversion of a voltage decay generated from a 

synthetic  ion  mobility  spectrum,  broadly  similar  to  the  observed  mean  small  ion 

spectrum6.  A  voltage  decay  time  series  for  the  aspirated  cylindrical  capacitor 

described in [3] and [9] was generated from the ion spectrum, Figure 4. Inversion of 

this  voltage  decay  using  the  RPIM  algorithm  (Section  4.1)  results  in  an  identical 

spectrum to the original, indicating that the mathematical inversion is exact. However 

the  typical  shape  of  small  ion  spectrum  is  generated  as  an  average  over  many 

measurements; the spectrum inverted numerically here was an average of 8615 hourly 

averaged ion spectra taken over 14 months6. The example demonstrates that the RPIM 

can  correctly  determine  ion  spectra  from  voltage  decay  data,  but  independent,  and 

ideally  synchronous,  measurements  of  voltage  decays  and  ion  mobility  spectra  are 

 

 

 

9

necessary  in  practical  evaluations.    It  should  also  be  noted  that  the  second  term  in 

Equation  11  is  small  compared  to  typical  experimental  uncertainty,  although  it  has 

been included in this numerical example for exactness. 

5.  Comparison of ion spectra measured in laboratory air 

The  RPIM  was  verified  by  comparing  ion  mobility  spectra  calculated  from  voltage 

decays,  to  spectra  computed  from  the  established  technique  of  voltage  switching  to 

vary the critical mobility13,15. The experiments were carried out in ambient indoor air, 

in  a  demonstrably  stable  atmospheric  electrical  environment  (described  in  detail  in 

[16]),  using  the  computer-controlled  Programmable  Ion  Mobility  Spectrometer 

(PIMS), with sensing electrodes 0.25m long and of radii 11mm and 2mm, ventilated 

at 2.1 ms-1  3,4. 

Voltage  decay  measurements  were  carried  out  using  a  Keithley  236  SourceMeter 

instrument  to  supply,  and  then  measure  (to  a  specified  accuracy  of  to  ±  0.025  %  + 

10mV), the voltage across the ventilated PIMS electrodes. Data was logged by a PC at 

1Hz via a GPIB/IEEE interface. The maximum voltage supplied by the Keithley 236 

is  110  V,  corresponding  to  a  critical  mobility  of  0.16  cm2V-1s-1  ±  0.025  %.  Three 

voltage decay events from nominally 110 V – 3 V, each of duration 2-3 hours were 

measured on 23 and 24 March 2005, Figure 5a. 

The Current  Mode  ion spectrum measurements took place on 24-25 March 2005, at 

the  same  temperature  and  relative  humidity  as  the  voltage  decay  measurements. 

Voltage switching through a predetermined sequence of error checking modes (as in 

[4]), and 15 bipolar voltages from -20.8 V - 21.1 V was implemented in software, and 

 

 

 

 

10

data logged via the RS232 port. Equation 9 can be used to calculate critical mobilities; 

only  results  from  the  positive  voltage  sequence  (3.9V  -  21.1V)  are  used  here, 

corresponding to positive ion critical mobilities in the range 0.9 - 3.5 cm2V-1s-1. Errors 

in the critical mobility result principally from the calibration of the digital to analogue 

converter  used  to  generate  the  bias  voltage,  ±  ~10%.  Ion  currents  were  sampled  at 

1Hz and averaged over 20s for each voltage step, and 90s of empirically determined 

recovery time was allowed between each change in bias voltage. The mean currents 

are  plotted  as  a  function  of  bias  voltage  in  Figure  5b.  Combining  Equation  2  and 

Equation 3 gives

where µis the average mobility. Increasing the bias voltage in steps from Vi-1 (through

increase the magnitude of the ion current from i(i-1) to i(i+1). The ion concentration in

Equation 17 

Experimentally, the rate of change of current with critical mobility can be determined 

by  using  linear  regression  between  a  set  of  measured  current  and  critical  mobility 

values (calculated for each bias voltage using Equation 9). Methods for measuring the 

capacitance term in Equation 17 are described in [4] and [17]).  

Both the RPIM and the voltage switching technique assume that no ions with mobility 

lower than the critical mobility can enter the cylindrical capacitor. However, some of 

these  larger  charged  particles,  which  constitute  the  particulate  space  charge,  can 

 

 

 

11

contribute to the measurement by drifting into the instrument and colliding with the 

sensing electrodes. The magnitude of the error from particulate space charge can be 

estimated  by  measuring  the  current  at  the  central  electrode  with  zero  bias  voltage 

applied, i.e. the current arising from particles unaffected by the electric field. This has 

been referred to previously as a “dynamic zero”. 10. A more rigorous approach to find 

the  dynamic  zero  is  to  calculate  the  intercept  of  the  bipolar  current-voltage  plots 

obtained  during  the  voltage  switching  measurements,  which  is  a  time-averaged 

dynamic zero. This dynamic zero was subtracted to produce the i-V curve shown in 

Figure 5b, but corresponded to 2.7 pCm-3 of negative space charge, or a maximum of 

17 (singly charged) particles cm-3.    

The  mean  ion  spectrum  was  calculated  using  the  RPIM  as  in  Section  4.1,  and  ion 

spectra from the voltage decay and current mode methods are shown in Figure 6. The 

spectra are similar in shape, and the mobility of the common peak is consistent with 

positive ion properties in the literature8,11. If the positive air conductivity due to small 

ions  is  calculated  by  integration  across  the  mobility  spectrum  (Equation  1),  then 

σ(current mode) = 2.7 ± 1.1 fSm-1, with the error determined from the variability in current 

measurements.  Mean  σ  (voltage  decay  mode)=  5.3  ±  2.5  fSm-1,  where  the  error  is  the 

standard deviation across the three measured spectra. This is the same as positive air 

conductivity  measured  at  the  same  location  by  an  aspirated  cylindrical  capacitor 

operating  in  current  mode  at  a  constant  bias  voltage,  ~3  fSm-1  [16].  The  co-located 

peaks,  well-correlated  spectral  shape  and  consistent  integral  spectra  all  give 

confidence in the RPIM approach, although there is some disagreement between the 

concentrations  calculated  at  the  extremes  of  the  small  ion  range,  1.5  >  µ  >  2.3  

cm2V-1s-1, The comparison of the new RPIM spectra with spectra obtained using the 

 

 

12

well-established technique shows firstly that the inversion generates reproducible and 

realistic  ion  mobility  spectra,  and  secondly  that  the  air  conductivity  computed  by 

integration  across  the  spectrum  is  comparable  with  that  found  in  the  same 

environment by a different method. 

6.  Discussion  

The  classical  theory  of  air  conductivity  measurement  for  voltage  decays  from  an 

aspirated  capacitor  can  be  modified  to  correct  for  the  assumption  that  the  critical 

mobility  of  ions  sampled  by  the  instrument  does  not  vary  during  the  decay.  The 

spectral information extracted from voltage decay data with the RPIM can be used to 

calculate  conductivity  directly  by  integration  rather  than  with  erroneous  simplifying 

assumptions, such as exponential decay.  

RPIM  has  practical  as  well  as  theoretical  advantages.  Measurements  of  atmospheric 

ion spectra (reviewed in detail in [9]) are often obtained by varying the bias voltage to 

change  the  ion  mobilities  selected  e.g.  [13],[14].  As  in  the  example  described  in 

Section 5, this requires dedicated electronics to switch the bias voltage, and sensitive 

current sensing. Both time and mobility resolution can be poor, as compromises must 

be made between the voltage size step, and the time the instrument rests at each bias 

voltage  to  obtain  an  averaged  current.  Adequate  time  must  also  be  allowed  for  the 

circuitry  to  recover  from  switching  transients.  RPIM  exploits  continuous  voltage 

decay,  which  avoids  delays  and  errors  from  switching  transients.  Smooth  voltage 

decays  also  minimise  the  sharp  changes  in  electric  field  at  the  cylindrical  capacitor 

inlet  caused  by  bias  voltage  switching,  which  may  perturb  ion  ingress  and  cause 

transient saturation in the instrument, briefly preventing any measurements17. Voltage 

 

 

 

13

decay measurements need only the simplest single-channel logging equipment and are 

ideally  suited  to  remote  in  situ  sensing  applications,  such  as  balloon-borne 

measurements18.  Data  processing  to  compute  the  ion  spectrum  and  integrated 

conductivity would typically be carried out off-line.  

The  RPIM  assumes  that  no  intermediate  or  large  ions  can  enter  the  cylindrical 

capacitor;  however,  it  can  be  seen  from  Section  5  that  the  magnitude  of  uncertainty 

introduced by this assumption is much lower than the variability between individual 

spectra. RPIM can also be used for extraction of spectral information from historical 

atmospheric  electrical  data  sets.  An  important  new  application  is  the  inversion  of 

voltage decay measurements made in the atmospheres of other planets, such as from 

the European Space Agency Huygens probe which used voltage relaxation techniques 

during the first in situ measurements of Titan’s atmosphere19.

Figure 2 Consecutive voltage decay time series measured in urban atmospheric air on 

June 12 1998. (The experimental apparatus and other results are described in detail in 

[3]).  Coefficient  of  determination  (R2)  values  are  shown  to  indicate  the  fraction  of 

variance  in  a  data  set  explained  by  an  exponential  model.  For  39  voltage  decays 

measured over two weeks, the mean R2 was 0.9 with a standard deviation of ± 0.1 (the 

range of values was 0.31-1.00).

Figure 4 Inversion of an artificial ion mobility spectrum, chosen to closely represent 

an atmospheric ion mobility spectrum. The experimental voltage decay time series the 

artificial  spectrum  would  have  generated  is  shown  (inset),  with  a  best  fit  line  to  an 

exponential. The voltage decay time series was then inverted back to an ion spectrum, 

and is plotted on the same axes as the original artificial spectrum.

Programmable  Ion  Mobility  Spectrometer  on  23-24  March  2005.  b)  Currents 

measured  over  a  range  of  bias  voltages  at  the  same  location  on  24-25  March  2005. 

The y-axis error bars are the standard error of the mean. 

Figure 6 Comparison of average indoor small positive ion spectra generated from the 

Relaxation  Probe  Inversion  Method  and  by  the  established  bias  voltage  switching 

technique. Typical errors in the x-axis mobility values are ±10%. Estimated errors in 

ion  concentrations  are  ±30%  for  the  switched  voltage  spectrum,  and  ±40%  for  the 

RPIM spectrum.

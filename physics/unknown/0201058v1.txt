Abstract

         It  will  be  shown that   the  gravitational  masses  of the  electrons  of  a  superconducting
material are  strongly negative. Particularly, for an  amount  of  mercury  (Hg)  at  the  transition
temperature, Tc = 4.15 K , the negative gravitational masses of the electrons   decrease  the
total  gravitational  mass  of  the  Hg    of  approximately  0.1  percent.  The  weight  reduction
increase  when the Hg is spinning  inside a magnetic field or when it is placed into a strong
oscillating EM field.

Introduction
          We  have  shown  in  a  previous
paper1  that the  gravitational  mass  and
the  inertial  mass  are  correlated  by  a
dimensionless    factor,  which  depends
on  the  incident  radiation  upon  the
particle.  It  was  shown  that  only  in  the
absence  of  electromagnetic  radiation
this  factor  becomes  equal  to  1  and
electromagnetic
specific 
that, 
conditions, 
reduced,
it  could  be 
nullified  or made   negative.
      The 
of
correlation  between  gravitational  mass
mg and inertial mass mi , is given by

to  the  outside  medium  around  the

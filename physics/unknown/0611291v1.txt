It is proposed that aspects of the tempo of the golf swing can be understood in 

terms of a biomechanical clock.  This model explains several aspects of tempo in the golf 

swing; including total duration of the golf swing, the ratio of backswing to downswing 

time, and the relative insensitivity of tempo on the length of the golf shot.  We 

demonstrate that this clock and the resulting tempo are defined by of the rotational inertia 

of the body/club system and the elastic properties of the body, yielding a system which 

can be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Tempo refers to the pace of the golf swing.  It is can be characterized by 

measuring the duration of the backswing, 

, and the duration of the downswing, 

bT

dT

.  

While qualitative discussions of tempo are as old as the game itself, quantitative 

measurement of tempo has existed only for a couple of decades [

1].  Recently, a study of 

the tempo of professional golfers was published in the book Tour Tempo [2] in which it 

was pointed out that the ratio of backswing to downswing time of professional golfers is 

of order three, 

b TT

3≈d

.  These measurements were made using the frame rate of 

standard video (i.e. 30 Hz frame rate) as the clock.  The tempo of the majority of tour 

professionals studied in Tour Tempo is characterized by 

24≈bT

 frames and 

8≈dT

 

frames.  The ratio 

b TT
d

 for all players reported in the study covered the range from 

21/7 to 30/10.  Also pointed out in Tour Tempo is that the overall tempo of professional 

golfers is significantly faster than that of the average golfer and that the tempo does not 

change significantly with the length of the shot or the type of club.   

 

In an attempt to more thoroughly characterize tempo, we have performed 

measurements on a wide variety of golfers, from tour professionals to the average 

weekend golfers, using electronics embedded in the shaft of the golf club.  The details of 

this measurement system are described elsewhere [3].  In summary, motion sensing 

accelerometers and wireless communications electronics mounted in the shaft allow us to 

determine the start of the swing, the transition from backswing to downswing, and the 

point of impact.  Sampling rates are of order 250 Hz, yielding eight times more detail 

than that obtained from conventional video.   

 

Ten to twenty swings were recorded for each golfer as they hit a five iron.  

bT

 

and 

dT

 are measured for each swing.  Using the ensemble of swings, the average and 

standard deviation of 

bT

 and 

dT

 is calculated for each golfer.  The standard deviation is 

used to characterize reproducibility.  The results of these measurements are displayed in 

Figs. 1.  The golfers are divided into three groups:  a) playing professionals (n=12); b) 

teaching professionals and good amateur golfers (n=13); and c) all other golfers (n=18).  

Each data point represents the averaged result for a particular golfer.  The standard 

deviations are indicated by error bars.

all other golfers, meaning that their swings are very reproducible.  Note that the time of 

the backswing of the tour professionals all seem to cluster in the vicinity of 

≈bT

 0.7 – 

0.8 sec, which corresponds to 21-24 frames per second of standard video, again 

consistent with the data presented in Tour Tempo.   

 

The distributions in Fig 1(b) and Fig 1(c) are noticeably larger than that of Fig 

1(a).  In both cases, the average ratio 

 is centered at 3.0, but varies widely, much 

b TT
d

more so for the last group of golfers.  As one might expect, the standard deviations 

measured for most other golfers are much larger than that of tour professionals.  

Additionally, the golf swings of the professional golfer are uniformly faster than that of 

the average golfer.   

 

The following three aspects of the tempo of playing professionals suggest the 

workings of a biomechanical clock:  1) the fact that all playing professionals have 

roughly the same tempo, 2) the very small variance in tempo from swing to swing for 

individual playing professionals, and 3) the relative insensitivity of tempo to the length of 

the swing or the type of club.  In this section we explore the plausibility that the simplest 

model of a clock, the simple harmonic oscillator, can be used to understand tempo in the 

golf swing of professional golfers.   

 

The simple harmonic oscillator requires a mass and a spring, i.e. a restoring force.  

In this proposed model the mass is comprised of the torso, legs, arms, and club.  The 

spring results from the “effective” elasticity of the biomechanical system, comprising the 

natural and trained response of the body.  The importance of elasticity in animal 

movement has long been documented [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], and we propose it plays a central role 

in defining the tempo of the golf swing of professional golfers.   

 

As a test of plausibility, consider the equation of motion of the driven harmonic 

oscillator,

and the velocity is zero.  Thus, the duration of the backswing is independent of the 

applied force, while the maximum displacement of the backswing is proportional to the 

applied force.   

 

The downswing begins at this point of maximum compression.  The direction of 

the applied force is reversed so as to help decompress the spring and return the mass to 

the original position.  We now solve this new problem

While this simple model can not possibly capture all of the dynamics of the golf 

swing, it has two very attractive aspects.  First, the time of the backswing is not 

dependent on the applied force; rather, it is defined by the resonant frequency of the 

system.  This is consistent with the notion that the duration of the backswing is 

independent of the length of the shot.  Second, the resulting values of 

b TT
d

 are 

comparable to the measured values, lending additional plausibility to this model.   

 

We have conducted the following experiment to further test the hypothesis that at 

its core, the golf swing is the biomechanical equivalent of a simple harmonic oscillator.  

 

 

The experiment is designed to measure the motion of the torso during the backswing 

swing subject to a constant applied force.  In particular, the experiment tests if the angle 

of rotation of the torso can be used as the generalized coordinate for the oscillator.  As 

was derived above, the simple harmonic oscillator model suggests the following two 

hypotheses:  1) the duration of the backswing should be independent of the applied force 

and 2) the amount of torso rotation should increase linearly with applied force.   

In the experiment a golfer is asked to hit golf balls, shots of varying length from 

relatively short chip shots to the longest possible shot.  While in the address position, one 

end of a cable is attached to the handle of the golf club, the other end of the cable 

fastened to a load cell (Transducer Techniques, model # MLP-50 ), and the cable is 

oriented along the target line so as to oppose the backswing.   

As the golfer tries to initiate the golf swing, the cable assembly prevents the 

backswing but measures the initial force applied by the golfer at the start of the swing.  

Once the applied force is measured, of order one to two seconds, the cable is cut and the 

golf swing is initiated.  An electromechanical gyroscope (Analog Devices ADXRS 300), 

attached to the back of the golfer and oriented along the spine, is used to measure the 

rotation of the torso.  The signals from both sensors are digitized and then collected by a 

computer, yielding a complete set of data every 4.4 ms.  Data are taken throughout the 

entire golf swing and data are then taken for many golf swings.  From these 

measurements we extract the maximum rotation of the torso during the backswing as a 

function of applied force and the total time of the backswing as a function of applied 

force.   

The data for a representative golfer with “tour tempo” are summarized in Fig. 3 

and Fig 4.  Shown in Fig. 3 is the time of the backswing as a function of the applied 

torque.  The torque is calculated having determined that the force measured by the load 

cell is applied through a moment arm of length 0.47 m normal to the axis of rotation of 

 

 

the torso.   

The solid line represents the mean of the measurements.  It is clear that the 

duration of the backswing is relatively insensitive to the applied torque, consistent with 

our first hypothesis.

Fig. 4 shows the maximum rotation of the torso as a function of the applied 

torque.  From the data in Fig. 3, we can make an estimate of the maximum torso rotation 

by assuming the rotation angle of the torso is the relevant displacement parameter for our 

harmonic oscillator model.  From the time of the backswing, we obtain an estimate of the 

resonant frequency, 

=Ω

.  With an estimate of the rotational inertia, one can then

make a guess as to the spring constant, 

2Ω= I

.

Biomechanics allows us to estimate the inertia of the system, which we do for the 

case of the golfer in the address position.  Our estimate includes the inertia of the golf 

club, torso, arms, and thighs.  The rotational inertia of the body is calculated using the 

parameters of de Leva  [9].  Rotation is assumed to occur around the long axis of the 

torso.  The orientation of the arms and club relative to the torso correspond to the stance 

of the golfer under study.  .   

The mass of the golf club is m = 0.43 kg.  The first and second moments of the 

club were measured relative to a point on the shaft that is between the left and right hands 

when the club is held by the golfer.  The first moment is measured to be 0.27 kg-m and 

the second moment 0.22 kg-m2.   

The resulting rotational inertia of the system is calculated to be I ~ 1.55 kg-m2 

with an accuracy of order 10%.  This yields an estimate for

.  This expression is shown as the solid blue line in Fig. 4.  Note that this 

estimate agrees relatively well with the data at low torque, but the maximum rotation 

angle clearly saturates at higher torque.

Figure 4:  Maximum angle of rotation of the torso as a function of the applied torque in 
the backswing.  The solid blue line is an estimate of what is expected if the torso 
responds as a simple spring.  The solid red curve is a fit to a model where the torso 
responds like a non-linear spring.   
 

 

It is well know that the torso can be modeled as a non-linear spring in which the 

torso becomes stiffer as the angle of rotation is increased [10, 11].  These measurements 

are typically done by applying a known force directly to the torso and measuring the 

resulting motion while the hips are restrained from movement.  The resulting spring 

constant is generally modeled as having an exponential dependence on displacement, 

.  While this is not the exact same constraint as in the golf swing, one

might imagine similar phenomena.   

 

We have fit our data in Fig. 4 to several non-linear models.  Shown in Fig. 4 as

was found to adequately fit the data, assumes the spring constant is symmetric about the 

origin and saturates more strongly than the exponential model described above.  The 

primary purpose in fitting this model to the data is to extract a value of k, the small angle 

spring constant, separate from the saturation effects which are completely accounted for 

The maximum rotation angle,  maxθ , corresponds to the point at which the 

potential energy of the spring equals the work done by the applied torque.

where τ is the applied torque.  This expression is fit to the data in Fig. 4 and is indicated 

by the red curve.  The resulting fitting parameters are k = 29 ± 4 N-m/radian and  0θ = 1.8 

± 0.3 radians [12].  Note that this value of k implies an inertia I = 1.7 ± 0.3 kg-m2, which 

is consistent with our earlier estimate of the rotational inertial at the address position.  It 

is clear that the elastic properties of the body, whether they are passive or active, 

combined with the inertial properties of the body/club system provide a self-consistent, 

first-order explanation of the tempo of the golf swing 

 

.The data in Fig. 4 provide clear evidence that the body functions as a non-linear 

spring when the torso rotation becomes large, consistent with biomechanical 

expectations.  This non-linearity poses interesting challenges in the pursuit of a more 

complete analysis of the biomechanical foundation of tempo.  In particular, a system with 

the non-linear spring described above should exhibit a decrease in the time of the 

backswing Tb with increasing applied torque.  We have modeled this phenomenon and 

found that Tb  decreased by as much as 50% for the largest applied torques, which is 

clearly not observed in the experiments.  Implicit in this calculation is a constant applied 

torque and a constant rotational inertia throughout the entire backswing.  In fact, neither 

of these conditions is likely to be true.  Our experimental configuration only measures the 

initial applied torque and, correspondingly, our inertial calculations only consider the 

address position. However, there is good reason to expect the applied torque and the 

rotational inertia change significantly from the beginning of the swing to the top of the 

backswing.  We propose these issues warrant a much more through series of 

biomechanical experiments and analysis.  Indeed, given the above arguments it is 

intriguing that the time of the backswing is relatively insensitive to the initial applied 

torque and, therefore, the length of the backswing.  On the face of it, one might expect 

these various non-linearities cancel each other so as to yield a system that, in the end, 

functions very nearly linearly.   

 

In summary, the tempo of the golf swing of professional golfers exhibits 

remarkable uniformity in 1) the absolute time scale, 2) the ratio of backswing time to 

downswing time and 3) the invariance of these times as a function of the length of the 

swing.  These observations suggest that professional golfers have at the core of their golf 

swing a biomechanical clock.  We propose that this clock and the resulting tempo is 

defined by of the rotational inertia of the body/club system and the elastic properties of 

the body, yielding a system which can be modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator.   

 

The results of an experiment designed to test this hypothesis are reported.  The 

time of the backswing is measured to be independent of the applied torque while the 

length of the backswing increases with applied torque, consistent with this simple model.  

Additionally, the rotational inertia of the system (i.e. club and body) combined with the 

time of the backswing yield an excellent estimate of the linear component of the spring 

constant.  Thus, to first order, we demonstrate that the tempo of the golf swing can be 

understood in terms of the physics of the simple harmonic oscillator.   

 

It is observed that the rotation of the torso during the backswing is consistent with 

the winding up of a non-linear spring, which is consistent with biomechanical 

expectations.  A complete biomechanical understanding of the tempo of the golf swing, 

including the non-linearity of the spring constant, the dynamics of the applied torque, and 

the position dependent rotational inertia remains an open issue and is proposed as the 

subject of future study.

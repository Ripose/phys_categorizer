Abstract 

        Much experimental evidence of superluminal phenomena has been available by 

electromagnetic  wave  propagation  experiments,  with  the  results  showing  that  the 

phase  time  do  describe  the  barrier  traversal  time.    Based  on  the  extrapolated  phase 

time approach and numerical methods, we show that the group velocities of modified 

Bessel  beams  can  be  superluminal,  and  obtain  the  following  results:  1)  the  group 

velocities increase with the increase of propagation distance, which is  similar to the 

evanescent plane-wave cases, but in detail, there has some differences between them; 

2) for large wave numbers, the group velocities fall off as the wave numbers increase, 

which is similar to the evanescent plane-wave cases; 3) for small wave numbers, the 

group velocities increase with the increase of wave numbers, this is different from the 

evanescent plane-wave cases.

1.    Introduction 

As  we  known,  for  a  given  wave  packet,  there  are  many  different  ways  we  can 

expand  it,  e.g.,  we  can  be  expand  it  as  the  superposition  of  the  plane  waves,  of  the 

cylindrical  waves  or  of  the  spherical  waves,  etc.,  which  depends  on  the  choice  of 

curvilinear coordinate systems.    Nevertheless, all the physical properties of the wave 

packet  are  independent  of  coordinate  transformations,  or,  not  dependent  on  the 

expansion  forms  of  the  wave  packet.    In  particular,  in  contrary  to  some  literatures 

[1-3],  an  ordinary  Bessel  beam  described  by  the  Bessel  functions  of  real  argument, 

actually  has  not  the  superluminal  behaviors  [4-7],  just  as  other  beams  such  as  the 

plane waves, etc.    In fact, the claim that, in the absence of dispersion the phase and 

the group velocity components along a given direction (say, the 

z

-axis direction) are 

(cid:75)
k

(cid:75)
k

equal, is wrong, provided that the totally wave number vector (say, 

) is not parallel 

to  the 

z

-axis  direction.    That  is  to  say,  let 

  denote  the  projection  of 

  in  the 

zk

z

-axis  direction, 

ω  the  frequency,  the  phase  velocity  component  is 

v

pz

kω=

/

 

z

while  the  group  velocity  component 

gzv

dkzω=
/

d

,  one  can  show 

v

pz

v≠

gz

  if 

(cid:75)
k≠

zk

.    It is highly important to note that, the phase velocity vector 

  does not 

(cid:75)
pv

obey the usual vector addition: the magnitude of the phase velocity component 

pzv

  is 

greater  than  that  of 

  itself  if 

zk

.    For  example,  when  electromagnetic 

(cid:75)
pv

(cid:75)
k≠

waves  are  reflected  back  and  forth  by  perfectly  conducting  walls  as  they  propagate 

along  the  length  of  a  hollow  waveguide,  their  phase  velocity  components  along  the 

waveguide are greater than the speed 

c

  of light in vacuum, while the instantaneous 

total phase velocities are always the speed 

c

  within the waveguide.    In a word, the 

 

2

phase velocity has the property of geometric artifact. 

However, contrary to the ordinary Bessel beam of real argument, we shall show 

that modified Bessel beams, described by the Bessel functions of imaginary argument, 

do have the superluminal behaviors.     

To  avoid  confusion,  let  us  point  out  that,  the  Bessel  beams,  via  which  the 

superluminal phenomena have been studied before [1-7], are the ones that propagate 

along  the  symmetry  axis  of  a  cylinder  (that  has  no  end  plates  and  is  open  on  both 

ends), their plane wavefront is perpendicular to the symmetry axis, while the Bessel 

beams  studied  in  this  paper  correspond  to  the  ones  that  propagate  along  the  radial 

direction of a cylinder (that has no lateral face and is open on circumference), with a 

cylindrical wavefronts perpendicular to the radial direction.     

2.    Modified Bessel beams and evanescent waves 

In Cartesian coordinate system  ( ,

x y z , assume that a hollow metal cylinder of 

, )

radius  ρ→ +∞   has  its  axis  coincident  with  the 

z

-axis,  two  perfectly  conducting 

plates  of  radius 

ρ→ +∞   are  L   apart,  they  form  two  parallel  end  plates  of  the 

cylinder and are respectively located at 

z

L= −

/ 2

  and 

z L=

/ 2

.    The cylinder has 

no lateral face.    A linear antenna with length  d

L≤   is placed at the symmetry axis 

of the cylinder extending from 

z

d= −

/ 2

  to 

z

d=

/ 2

, and 

d

  is small compared to 

the  wavelength 

λ  of  the  fields  produced  by  the  antenna.    In  the  present  case,  the 

boundary  condition  suggests  the  use  of  cylindrical  coordinate  system  ( ,
r

zθ  
, )

(

x

=

r θ

, 

y

=

r θ

).    Let  ω  denote  the  angular  frequency, 

k

cω=
/

  the 

wave number, 

c

  the velocity of light in vacuum.    As we known, the fields in the far

  (where 

r

  is  the  distance  from  the  source  to  the  field  point)  represent 

the radiation fields of the antenna, for the objectives of the present paper, we limit our 

attention  to  just  the  far-zone  fields.    Let

Consider 

that  analogous 

tunneling  experiments  with  classical  evanescent 

electromagnetic  modes  have  shown  the  results  are  essentially  in  agreement  with  the 

quantum mechanical phase time approach [8](note that the phase time has nothing to 

do  with  the  phase  velocity),  we  shall  show  the  superluminal  behaviors  of  modified 

Bessel  beams  via  the  phase  time  approach.    To  gain  physics  insight,  we  restrict 

ourselves to the extrapolated phase time approach [9-11] and, approximately, attribute 

 

9

to the extrapolated phase time the physics meaning of the transit time for the modified 

Bessel  beams  propagating  through  the  region  between 

r

r=   and

r=

case, following the usual procedure, one can obtains the extrapolated phase time

We show the superluminal behavior of the modified Bessel beams via numerical 

methods (by Mathematica 5.0), and give the diagrammatic curves related to the ratio 

/v c

  instead of the group velocity 

v

  itself.    For simplicity we let

  and 

κ=

400 k

−

  (see 

Equ. (17)).     

Bessel beams as follows:   

Following  Fig.  1-4  we  summarize  the  superluminal  behavior  of  the  modified 

1) The group velocity 

v

  of the modified Bessel beams is proportional to the width 

2w r

r
= − 1

, which accords with the so-called Hartman effect [12];   

 

10

2) For the wave number 

k

  satisfying 

0.6

≈

k

k
≤ <

20

, the group velocity 

v

  of the 

0

modified  Bessel  beams  decreases  as  the  wave  number  increases,  which  implies  that 

the group velocity 

v

  increases as the height of photonic barrier increases;   

3) For 

0.6

≈

k

0

k
≥ >

0

, the group velocity 

v

  rapidly increases as the wave number 

increases,  which  implies  that  the  group  velocity 

v

  increases  as  the  height  of 

photonic barrier decreases. 

Of course, the numerical value of 

  depends on the choices of the parameters 

0k

0L

, 

1L

  and 

w

,  etc.    Furthermore,  in  the  present  case,  according  to  the  treatments 

of  Mathematica  5.0,  the  points 

k =   and 
0

k =

20

  are  the  singular  points  of 

v

=

v k w
( ,
)

.    Therefore,  as  the  wave  number 

k

  approaches  0  or  20,  the  specific 

values  of  the  group  velocity 

v

  are  meaningless,  but  this  does  not  disturb  what  we 

concern.    The programs by Mathematica 5.0 are given in Appendix A. 

4.    Conclusions and prospects 

        We have shown that, in contrary to the ordinary Bessel beam of real argument, 

the  modified  Bessel  beams  have  the  superluminal  behaviors.    Furthermore,  as  a 

comparison between the superluminal behaviors of the modified Bessel beams and 

those  of  the  evanescent  plane-waves  (the  latter  have  been  studied  in  photonic 

tunneling  experiments),  we  also  give  the  diagrammatic  curves  for  the  evanescent 

plane-waves that tunneling through a photonic barrier (the photonic barrier width is 

2w r

= −

r
1

, and the photons within the photonic barrier satisfy 

κ=

400 k

−

2

).    As 

far  as  the  superluminal  behaviors  of  the  modified  Bessel  beams  and  those  of 

evanescent plane-waves are concerned, one can draw conclusions as follows: 

 

11

(a) Their group velocities both increase with the increase of propagation distance (i.e., 

the  width 

2w r

r
= − 1

),  but  in  more  detail,  their  curves  of  phase  time  vs  propagation 

distance have some differences;   

(b)  For  the  wave  number 

k

  satisfying 

0.6

≈

k

k
≤ <

20

,  their  curves  of  group 

velocities vs wave numbers are similar to each other;   

(c)  For  the  wave  number  k   satisfying 

0.6

≈

≥ > ,  their  curves  of  group 

0

k

velocity vs wave number are different from each other.    With the increase of wave 

number,  the  group  velocities  of  the  modified  Bessel  beams  rapidly  increase  while 

0

k

0

those of the evanescent plane-waves fall off.     

        In our future work, we try to interpret the superluminal behaviors of the modified 

Bessel beams as mentioned above (c).

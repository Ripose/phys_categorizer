Abstract

Numerous upper bounds on the (anti)neutrino rest mass have been published

based on the SN1987A observations.  Here, we use a nonkinematic (thermal) time

extent to provide a rest-mass estimate of a few eV (as mc2 energy), if not zero.   In

the solution, we find that a typical upper-bound formula for the mass implies that

this thermal extent was attributable to about 10% of the particle energy measured

on Earth.   The present approach yields an expected value for the mass, given any

theoretical or model-dependent estimate of the fraction of the detected neutrino

energy attributable to the supernova temperature.

I.  Introduction

The theoretical proposal of the neutrino particle in 1930, by Pauli, was followed

by the experimental demonstration of the existence of the electron neutrino in 1953

by Reines.   At the time, it was assumed that, like the photon, the electron neutrino

likely would have a rest mass of zero [1].   The current Standard Model of

elementary particles postulates massless neutrinos [2]; however, many theorists in

astrophysics and particle physics believe that all the leptons, including the

neutrinos, should be massive [32; 3-5].   At 5  eV c2 , the rest mass would be about

10 5−

 that of an electron; this doesn’t seem unreasonable, although it certainly is not

proven either by the current paper or any previous work.

The temporal interval of an observed particle stream from a distant event may be

analyzed into three components:   (1) The creation interval of the primitive event, (2)

the dispersion interval of the particle creation kinematics (here called the energy

extent), and (3) the dispersion interval because of the temperature during creation

(here called the thermal extent).   The total time interval at the detector is the

detection interval.   In the case of supernova neutrinos, the center of mass motion of

the primitive region, assumed very subluminal relative to Earth, would not affect

any of the time intervals measurably; and, no supernova process would be expected

to reduce the times, under the First and Second Laws of thermodynamics, unless by

rare chance, a possibility we here ignore.

J. M. Williams                                                Neutrino Temp v. 1.05                                                                       3

 If the electron (anti)neutrino had zero mass, the transit from a supernova to

Earth would be assumed to have been at the exact speed of light in a vacuum,

making the detection interval always equal to the creation interval and the other

components zero; however, a neutrino with nonzero rest mass may not be allowed

the speed of light.

II.  The 1987 Supernova Burst

The Kamiokande II and Irvine-Michigan-Brookhaven (IMB) neutrino detectors

were designed to study proton decay and Solar neutrino flux.   Both were operating

in February of 1987, when the SN1987A supernova event occurred in the Greater

Magellanic Cloud at a distance of about 50,000 parsecs.   The star causing this

supernova has been identified and was catalogued as a blue giant of about 15 Solar

masses before the supernova [6].   The Kamiokande II data, with inferred neutrino

energies accurate to about 20% [7], are plotted in Fig. 1; the IMB data were similar

but show fewer neutrinos over a shorter time interval.

Looking at Fig. 1, the maximum detection interval possible would seem to be

about 15 seconds.   The period up to about 2 seconds also might be considered the

detection interval for a distinct subevent.

III.  Thermal Extent yields an Estimate of the

Mass

A.  Neutrino thermal velocity component

Let us assume the neutrino to have nonzero rest mass.   Also, let us assume (a)

that a gas of boron 8B atoms (b) at approximately 109 K [9] was the primitive

substance for the neutrinos detected.

J. M. Williams                                                Neutrino Temp v. 1.05                                                                       5

Consider the effect of an error in assumption (a):  Primitives, say, atoms or

stripped nuclei, heavier than 8B boron, such as 28Si or 56Fe, would reduce the

thermal velocity estimate (to be given below) by no more than a factor of three; for

all else the same, this would require slightly more massive neutrinos to account for

the observed detector energies.   But, because the creation interval would include

any subsequent weak-force diffusion period, the kinetic temperature probably

should reflect a primitive lighter than these heavy-element fusion products.   So, we

will accept 8B as the primitive substance somewhat arbitrarily and without further

consideration of error.     We accept assumption (b) as reasonable and will comment

on a range of temperatures later.

The thermal extent by definition is meant to ignore all kinematic energy

differences [10] and to sidestep complexities [4, 9, 11-13] of state during the creation

interval; these factors will be seen later to be described in the energy, not thermal,

extent of the observations.

The observed neutrinos being assumed massive, the primitive thermal motion

would add a random component to the velocity of the neutrino as measured in the

inertial frame of the detector on Earth.   We estimate this velocity dispersion by

equating the primitive kinetic and thermal energy as

in which  mp  and  υ

 respectively represent the rest mass and rms average thermal

the speed from eq. (2) would be  υ

p

≅ ⋅3 106  m/s  ≅  0.01c.

For simplicity, we accept this average speed of about  0.01c as mapping directly to

the thermal extent.   We shall double it to convert it from an absolute-value scalar

to the one-dimensional magnitude of the temperature factor in a neutrino velocity

vector on the line of flight between the supernova and Earth.   The thermal extent

may be scaled, if desired, based on the reader’s favorite probability theory (e. g.,

[14]); the creation spectral distribution has been described as Planckian [15].   We

note that for purely thermal particles, we would add the creation interval, left for

now as an unknown, to the thermal extent to get the detection interval.

So, taking the distance from the Supernova to Earth as sSE , the spatial line-of-

flight dispersion of interneutrino distance at Earth as dsSE, and the speed of the

neutrino as vSE,  the thermal extent  dtSE

t

 may be computed from the supernova (or

Earth) proper transit time tSE using these relations:

We note that the thermal speed  υ

 has been eliminated in favor of temperature

and thermal energy, and that there is no assumption of any spread in particle

energies in (8).   Also, (8) is an expected-value estimate, depending solely on the

bounds of its parameters; it is not a formula for an upper or lower bound.

IV.  Energy Extent yields an Upper Bound on the

Mass

A proposed analysis based on energy dispersion was published by Zatsepin [16] in

1968, long before data were available; he seems to have believed that supernova

data could not be used to estimate the neutrino rest mass if it was above about 2

eV c2 .   The subsequent literature [10, 12-15, 17-31] based on energy analysis of the

SN1987A data have concluded neutrino mass upper bounds in the low tens of eV or

less.   Anada and Nishimura [27] used a temperature-based coherence argument to

eliminate the SN1987A data as a way of evaluating the theory of neutrino type

oscillations.   Roos [24] mentioned the possibility of calculating a thermal-dispersion

bound on the neutrino rest mass but evidently did not attempt a formula for it.

J. M. Williams                                                Neutrino Temp v. 1.05                                                                       9

Abbott et al [21] used both energy and thermal parameters in a differential

formulation which seemed to yield a zero rest mass because zero fell near the middle

of a fairly broad error range.    At least one author [19] has asserted that "model-

independent" limits are not reliable.  The majority of the published papers on the

subject introduce specific supernova or particle assumptions.

 Reasonable model-independent formulae for the energy extent usually assume a

neutrino creation interval of a few seconds or less.   Here, we adopt a variation of a

formula in [10; cf. 24] as follows,

in which  dtSE

E  is the energy extent,  sSE  is as above, and  E E  is the energy of the

detected neutrino.   The detected energy of course would include any thermal kinetic

component determined by the primitive temperature.   There is an implied

assumption that the creation interval amounted to a negligible time, so that the

energy extent would refer to all or most of the detection interval; namely,

∆E EE

E ≅ ⇒1

≅ 1 .   This yields an upper bound on the

mass: The  ∆E E  cannot reasonably exceed  E E ; and this formula ignores the kinetic

term in (6) above, moving supernumerary energy into the  mc2  mass.   Solving (9) for

the neutrino mass  mν yields

which may be compared with the formula (8) above for  mt

V.  Implications of the Two Rest Mass Formulae

Suppose the neutrino creation kinematic energy was constant, so all neutrinos

were created with the same energy, but with different thermal variation.   Then, the

thermal extent would equal the energy extent and not merely be included in the

latter.   In this case, (8) might be used alone to estimate the rest mass.

We here accept that the kinematic energy was not equal for every neutrino, and

so might be used to account for any assumed difference between creation and

detection intervals.   The thermal (8) and energy (10) estimates each yield a mass

based on an unknown overlap in the thermal vs. energy contributions.  However, in

neither formula is the overlap defined; thus, in neither is it constrained.   So, having

assuming a nonzero rest mass, we equate the  mt

ν and  mE

ν  masses (8) and (10) of the

neutrino and arrive at the following formula,

in which the expected-value brackets for  E t  have been dropped.   Using the trial

values,  dtSE

= 10s  and  E E = 10 MeV, we find that dtcreate from (11) can be within a

few seconds of zero only for values of  E t  about as shown in Table 1.    E E  only

implies an upper bound on the mass because of (10); it is independent otherwise of

any bound.    So, the value of  E E  might be used directly in place of  E t  in (8) for a

J. M. Williams                                                Neutrino Temp v. 1.05                                                                       11

mass estimate, provided a model or theory could account for the thermal fraction at

the detector.

Table 1 shows that 10 MeV neutrinos created at a primitive temperature of 109 K

would require  E t  near 1 MeV.   Happily, the range of the energy ratio near  dtcreate

= 0

in (11) is relatively insensitive to the value of  dtSE  chosen; the Table 1 dependence

on primitive temperature is relatively mild in the region tabulated.

Finally, Fig. 2 displays the rest mass here estimated for the first time by the

thermal extent; it also shows how the energy extent provides an upper bound as

ordinarily estimated.   Taking the  detection interval as 2 s, which seems not

unreasonable from the Kamiokande II data in Figure 1, we conclude that the mass

would be a few  eV c 2 and can not exceed about 6  eV c 2 .   If we were allowed the

additional assumption that the creation interval was, say 1.5 s, we could use Figure

2 to conclude a neutrino mass of about 3  eV c 2 .   Conversely, if we knew the

neutrino mass to be, say, 1 eV, we would know that the creation interval was just

1.8 s.   As shown by the differences between the thermal-extent and energy-extent-

bound curves in Figure 2, as the assumed creation interval decreases, the thermal

extent comes to dominate the detection interval, regardless of the supernova model.

The same dominance would be expected under an increase in the assumed

supernova primitive temperature.

VI.  Conclusion

We have shown that the thermal line-of-flight dispersion of the neutrinos from

supernova SN1987A might be used to estimate the rest mass, knowing the fraction

of neutrino energy at the detector attributable to temperature.   Then, assuming

massive neutrinos created in an interval not exceeding 10 seconds and at a boron-

like primitive temperature of 109 K, we used an upper-bound formula to find that

J. M. Williams                                                Neutrino Temp v. 1.05                                                                       13

the thermal fraction might reasonably account for about 10% of the neutrino energy

at Kamiokande II.   From this, not the energy upper bound per se, it followed that

the neutrino rest mass, here assumed not zero, would be as much as a few  eV c 2 .

The present approach assumed nothing about the supernova dynamics but still

yielded an expected value, not a bound.   Any supernova model providing a better

estimate of the thermal energy fraction would yield a better expected value.

Abstract 

Earlier  RDDS  (Rounded  Damped  Detuned  Structures)  [1,2],  designed,  fabricated  and  tested  at  SLAC,  in 
collaboration  with  KEK,  have  been  shown  to  damp  wakefields  successfully.  However,  electrical breakdown has been 
found to occur in these structures and this makes them inoperable at the desired gradient. Recent results [3] indicate that 
lowering  the  group  velocity  of  the  accelerating  mode  reduces  electrical  breakdown  events.  In  order  to  preserve  the 
filling time of each structure a high synchronous phase advance (150 degrees as opposed to 120 used in previous NLC 
designs) has been chosen. Here, damping of the wakefield is analyzed. Manifold damping and interleaving of structure 
cell frequencies is discussed. These wakefields impose alignment tolerances on the cells and on the structure as a whole. 
Tolerance calculations are performed and these are compared with analytic estimations.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The  previous  series  of  R/DDS  have  been  shown  to 
successfully  damp 
transverse  dipole 
wakefield  in  1.8  meter  long  structures,  each  of  which 
consist  of  206  cells  [2].      The  wakefield  was  measured  
and  found  to  be  well  predicted  by  the  spectral  function 
method.  However, these structures suffer from electrical 
breakdown and for this reason the accelerating structures 
have been redesigned.  Particular attention has been paid 
to  reducing  the  surface  field  on  the  cavities,  improving 
surface  cleanliness,  reducing  the  overall  structure  length, 
and  on  reducing  the  group  velocity  of  the  fundamental 
mode.   This has resulted in a significant reduction of the 
number of breakdown events recorded [3].   In this paper 
we  report  on  manifold  damping  and  detuning  of  the 
wakefield in H60VG3.   This 55 cell structure is 60 cm in 
length  and  has  an  average  group  velocity  of  0.03c.      In 
performing  this  design  we  note  that  we  are  restricted  to 
limited  couplings  to  the  manifold  as  the  slots  sizes  are 
required to be as small as is practical in order to limit the 
effects of pulse heating in this area.    Also, the structures 
have  been  optimised  to achieve maximum efficiency and 
thus any change in the central frequency is required to be 
small  in  order  to  preserve  the  efficiency  as  much  as  is 
possible.      The  damping  of  these  new  structures  are 
reported on section 2 and the alignment tolerances that are 
imposed on the structures by this wakefield for a specified

2.  INTERLEAVING OF STRUCTURES 
The  spectral  function  code  that  we  use  to  calculate  the 
wake  for  this  design  has  recently  been  highly  optimised 
using  sparse  matrix  techniques.    The  matrix  describing 
two-fold  interleaving  of  structures  is  obtained  from  the 
non-interleaved single structure circuit model [1,4] which 
is reformulated in the form:

In all of our previous calculations [5] of interleaving of 
the  cells  of  the  frequencies  of  adjacent  accelerating 
structures  we  have  taken  the  average  of  each  spectral 
function  and  from  this  obtained  the  overall  wakefield.  
Here, we make a calculation on the global matrix, which 
for 3-fold interleaving of structures is of a similar form as 
eq.  2.1  (but  of  overall  dimensions  9xN).      We  then 
compare  the  averaging  method  with  the  full  matrix 
method described by 2.1 and we find the difference in the 
two methods is at worst no more than 2%.  This gives us 
confidence 
in 
subsequent  calculations;  which  is  significantly  more 
efficient to apply in practice.   However, the global matrix 
technique  will  be  used  in  the  final  section  in  which  an 
analytic  method 
to  approximate  structure 
tolerances.

that the wake must be below 1 V/pC/mm/m in order that

where f  is the dipole frequency of each cell.  This results 
in  a  slightly  improved  wakefield  compared  to  the 
Gaussian distribution we have used in other designs.  We 
chose to minimise the “cost” function, defined as the sum 
of  the  squares  of  the  standard  deviation  and  rms  of  the 
sum wakefield (defined as the sum of the wakefield of all 
previous bunches up until the bunch under consideration).  
The  lowermost wakefield in Fig 2, is obtained for 3-fold 
interleaving, and it clearly illustrates the utility of the

The  rms  of  the  sum  wake  provides  an  indication as to 
whether or not BBU (Beam Break Up) will occur and it is 
in  Fig.  3  as  the  bunch  spacing  is  varied 
shown 
(corresponding 
the  cell 
to  a  systematic  error 
frequencies).  Past experience has indicated that provided 
the  rms  is  less  than  unity  then  BBU  does  not  occur  and 
this  is  the  case  for  three-fold  interleaved  H60VG3  to 
within  +/-30MHz  of  the  central  dipole  frequency.    The 
standard  deviation  of 
the  sum  wakefield  provides 
information as the alignment tolerance of the structures. In 
the  following  section  we  calculate  these  tolerances  in 
detail. 

in 

3. ALIGNMENT TOLERANCES 
The  transverse  long  range  and  short  range  wakefield 
dilutes  the  final  emittance  of  the  beam  at  the  end  of  the 
linac  and  it  imposes  a  tolerance  on  the  alignment  of 
groups  of  cells.    The  tolerance  due  to  the  long  range 
 

transverse wakefield is calculated both with an analytical 
method  [6]  and  by  numerically  tracking  the  beam  down 
the  linac  and  moving  groups  of  cells  transversely  in  a 
random  manner    (for  a  specified  rms  offset)  with  the 
computer  code  LIAR[7].      The  tolerance  under  the 
influence  of  short  range  wakes  is  obtained  entirely  by 
tracking through the full linac.    The tolerances that result 
from this procedure for a maximum emittance dilution of 
10% are shown in Fig 4 for the linac parameters  given in 
[6],  modified  to  take  into  account  3-fold  interleaving  of 
structures  (an  initial  Gaussian,  non-optimised  and  3-fold 
interleaved  H60VG3  structure  is  used).    The  agreement 
between  the  analytical  model  and  the  tracking  method  is 
very  good.    The  long-range  wake  imposes  a  single-cell 
alignment  tolerance  of  20µm  and  a  structure-to-structure 
alignment tolerance of 42µm.      

The  short-range  wake  imposes  a  tolerance  that  is 
proportional to the square root of the length of the section 
under  consideration  and  it  is  clear  from  Fig  5  that  the 
structure-to-structure  tolerance  is  dominated  by  this 
effect.    However,  we  note  that  beam-based  alignment  is 
used to enable this tolerance to be met. 

For the optimised distributions, shown in section 2, we 
expect  the  tolerances  to  be  relaxed  considerably.    These 
tolerances will be provided in a later publication.

Previously we suggested [1 – 3] a concept of hidden time for building dynamical model underlying 
quantum  phenomena.  This  paper  brings  a  detailed  hidden  time  explanation  of  some  basic  quantum 
experiments. 

 

"The  problem  is  that  the  theory  is  too  strong, 
too  compelling.  I  feel  we  are  missing  a  basic 
point. The next generation, as soon as they will 
have found that point, will knock on their heads 
and say: How could they have missed that?”

Simple interference 

 
Let  us  assume  most  fundamental  quantum  phenomenon:  the  interference.  Fig.1  shows 
Mach  –  Zehnder  interferometer.  Experimenter  supplies  one  photon  in  direction  1.  Standard 
quantum – mechanical description of this experiment is as follows.

At the 1st 50\50 beam splitter quantum state of the photon is split in the superposition of

After passing the 2nd beam splitter, the state 1’ is split into superposition of states 1’’ and

If we have no phase shifter at path 2’ at all (φ = 0), we get that detector D1 never clicks.

Here’s what hidden time concept provides for this experiment. 

At first, scout waves propagate from 1st beam splitter to detectors by all possible paths 
(fig. 2a).

Fig.2a 
 Hidden time at work: scout waves come to each detector by all paths 

Scout waves propagate like standard classical electromagnetic waves. This is why we put 
two mutually shifted waves at paths 1’’ and 2’’: they originate from summing 1’ and 2’. Please 
note that phase shifter provides some additional rotation of wave phase in the 2’ path. 

Note also that physical time does not go while these waves “move”. 

 
2. 
When any detector receives a scout wave, it sends a query wave (Fig. 2b). Query wave 
can  be  just  reversed  in  “time”  variable  scout  wave,  since  Maxwell  equations  for  free 
2ψ  of query waves matters, 
electromagnetic field is time – reversible. But in fact only intensity 

not the phase. Intensity is a measure of survivability of waves sent by different detectors.  
 

Fig.2b 
 Hidden time at work: query waves start to compete 
 

At Fig. 2b a query wave from D2 is stronger (say, φ in (4) and (5) is rather small, so P2 > 
 
P1), so it has more chances to win a query wave from D1. Still, as one can see from Fig. 2c, we 
admit that nevertheless D1 wins. I do so to express that intensity of a query wave means only the 
probability  to  win.  D2  has,  generally  speaking,  a  greater  probability  to  win,  but  this  time  D1 
wins.  If  we  repeat  the  experiment  many  times,  the  number  of  each  detector’s  clicks  is 
2ψ .  It  is  exactly  what  standard  quantum  mechanics 
proportional  to  its  query  wave  intensity

provides.

Fig.2c 
 Hidden time at work: the winner query wave propagates 
 
 

After  winning  at  2nd  beam  splitter,  query  wave  of  D1  propagates  next  by  all  possible 
 
ways, i.e. by ways provided by scout waves before (Fig. 2c), i.e. by 1’ and 2’. Each way’s copy 
of  that  wave  comes  to  1st  beam  splitter  and  they  also  compete  there.  Since  they  are  of  equal 
intensity, they have equal chances to win the competition. In fact, it is not essential which one 
wins, because each of these waves is representative of the same single detector D1. 
 
  

 

 

Fig.2d 
 Hidden time at work: detector D1 gets the photon 
 
 

 
At  Fig.  2d  2’  path  wins.  Green  signal  means  propagation  of  confirmation  wave,  which 
finally comes to detector D1. Red signal is refusal wave (just like at Fig. 2c), it propagates up to 
it’s source, i.e. 2nd beam splitter. 
 
3 

The trick here is that all the waves represented above do not propagate in physical time. 
 
Only  coming  of  confirmation  wave  (green)  to  D1  corresponds  to  an  instant  of  physical  time. 
Though  we  have  3  passes  of  waves  from  a  source  to  some  detector,  and  though  each  of  these 
passes obeys Maxwell’s equations for free electromagnetic field, finally total time for a photon 
to travel to the detector is such as if the photon simply moves classically from the source to the 
detector with light speed! 
 

This sounds very strange, but it is correct if one takes 4 postulates: 

 

4

 

Any  photon’s  exchange  by  charges  is  accomplished  through  presented  mechanism  of  3 

Only  final  coming  of  confirmation  wave  to  some  detector  (a  charge)  corresponds  to  an 

(a) 
passes of waves; 
(b) 
instant of physical time; 
(c) 
Each  detector  charge  serves  all  scout  waves  from  different  source  charges  it  receives 
consequently;  this means that a detector charge sends a query wave in response to some scout 
wave only after a confirmation (or a refusal) is received for a previously sent query wave; 
(d) 
for each experimental configuration.  

Detected physical time is simply a number of detected light quanta, properly normalized 

One can find more detailed arguments in [2] and [3]. 

II. 

Delayed Choice 

Let  us  take  that  we  have  no  phase  shifter  at  the  path  2’  of  our  Mach  –  Zehnder 

1  
 
“Delayed  choice”  experiment  was  originally  suggested  by  J.  A.  Wheeler  as  a 
gedankenexperiment. At the moment many versions of delayed choice experiment are proposed 
and realized. We assume the simplest version as it is presented in [4]. 
 
interferometer at Fig. 1: φ = 0. In this case, D1 never clicks; instead, D2 clicks each time.   
 
Next, suppose that “at last moment” experimenter decides to perform another experiment 
than  he  originally  intended:  he  pulls  2nd  beam  splitter  out  of  the  photon’s  path  2’.  “At  the  last 
moment”  means,  of  course,  before  a  moment  of  time,  when  classically  moving  photon  should 
reach the beam splitter. 

In this case, the photon hits D1 and D2 with equal probabilities. In other words, pulling 
out 2nd beam splitter “at the photon’s nose” gives the same result as if there were no 2nd beam 
splitter from the very beginning. 

From  standard  quantum  mechanical  viewpoint,  the  explanation  is  as  follows.  We  take 
into  account  all  classically  possible  paths  in  space-time  for  the  photon;  each  path  provides  its 
own complex-valued amplitude iψ . Total amplitude of considered transition is the sum  ∑ iψ for 
all paths. 

So, when the 2nd (upper at Fig. 1) beam splitter is removed from the interferometer at a 
proper time, each classically possible path in space-time does not encounter that beam splitter on 
its way. Thus destructive interference for D1 disappears. 

 
What  explanation  will  hidden  time  approach  provide  for  delayed  choice  experiment? 
First, let us take for simplicity that 2nd beam splitter is not removed indeed from it its position; 
instead it is in some way switched off to be transparent for light. Switching off is accomplished 
by some electromagnetic signal. Again, we can take for simplicity that that this signal consist of 
a single quantum of light. 
 
Recall  that  according  to  rule  (a)  (Section  3)  this  quantum  propagates  obeying  the  same 
general mechanism we outlined before. This means that initially a scout wave of this quantum 
arrives  to  the  beam  splitter  (Fig.  3a).  We  assume  that  we  switch  off  the  beam  splitter  “at  the 
nose” of the photon which propagates within the interferometer. This means that scout wave of 
switching  photon  arrives  (in  hidden  time!)  to  the  beam  splitter  earlier  than  the  scout  wave  of 
interferometer photon.

Fig.3a 
 Hidden time at work: scout wave of control photon comes to 2nd beam splitter 
 
 

 
 
 
According to rule (c) from Section 3, this means that the beam splitter (we take it as if it 
is a single charge) serves switching photon first. Interferometer’s photon scout waves stands un-
served (and with no further propagation) until switching photon is ultimately served: i.e. until it 
is absorbed or rejected by the beam splitter.   

 
Fig.3b 
 Hidden time at work: query wave of control photon comes from 2nd beam splitter 
 
 

So,  the  beam  splitter  sends  query  wave  in  response  to  switching  photon’s  scout  wave 
 
(Fig.  3b).  Then,  it  receives  confirmation  wave,  i.e.  the  switching  photon  itself  (Fig.  3c).  Of 
course,  we  suggest  that  the  beam  splitter  receives  confirmation  rather  then  refuse,  since  we 
assume that we do switch off the beam splitter! 
 

 
Fig.3c 
 Hidden time at work: confirmation wave of control photon comes to 2nd beam splitter 
 
 

 
Only after switching off the beam splitter (which is equivalent to receiving confirmation 
wave  in  hidden  time)  scout  waves  of  interferometer’s  photon  propagate  next  from  the  beam 
splitter  to  detectors.  And  now  they  do  not  interfere  (Fig.  3d),  since  the  beam  splitter  is 
practically absent!

Fig.3d 
 Hidden time at work: scout waves don’t interfere since beam splitter is transparent 
 
 

 

So  in  this  case  query  waves  from  D1  and  D2  compete  to  each  other  at  the  1st  beam 

 
splitter, kike at Fig. 2d, and finally any detector can click.  
 
 

III. 

Entanglement: the core 

 
1 
Again,  we  start  from  what  standard  quantum  theory  provides  for  entanglement.  In 
 
quantum optics domain we can get entangled photons most simply by 50\50 beam splitter (Fig. 
4).  Let  us  take  that  we  send  horizontally  polarized  photon  to  input  1  and  vertically  polarized 
photon  to  input  2  of  the  beam  splitter.  Since  the  50\50  beam  splitter  adds  a  phase  factor  i  to 
redirected “half” of each photon, we at the outputs:

On the other side, imagine that we use not  H  and  V  polarizations for input photons; 

1P  and 

2P  – the derivation of final result does not depend on this 
instead, we use arbitrary 
substitution. Next, let us take that P1 = P2 = P, i.e. our photons are indistinguishable. In that case,

50\50 beam splitter we have  H  scout wave at input 1 and  V  wave at input 2 (Fig. 5a).  
 
 

Here’s  what  hidden  time  concept  can  offer  to  explain  entanglement.  At  the  inputs  of 

Recall that the beam splitter splits each wave:

Recall also that in hidden time model each term of this sum represents some new thread 
of a scout wave. When we multiply such sums, from hidden time view, this means that each term 
thread in each sum becomes “tied” or “married” to each term thread in the other sum. So, each 
term in each factor is split again, while the factor of splitting is the number of terms in paired 
factor.  
 
waves (Fig. 5b): 

Thus after leaving the beam splitter we have 2 × 2 = 4 groups of tied (or married) scout 

 
Let  us  refer  to  each  group  of  tied  threads  as  a  bunch.  Each  of  these  bunches  of  scout 
waves correspond (with appropriate factors) to some term in (6) (when in expanded view!). Each 
bunch has a kind of connection knot, where single – photon waves are “tied”. Any scout wave

within  bunch  can  be  viewed  as  to  be  “married”  with  its  partner.  We  mark  it  by  a  kind  of 
“marriage rings” at Fig. 5b.   
 
 

 

 

 

 
Fig 5b 
Entanglement: 4 bunched output states 
 
 

 

When we say “the second photon” we mean that it is in some way distinguishable from the first 
photon. Turn back to a series of Fig 2. The second beam splitter of the Mach – Zehnder interferometer 
does not make additional splitting of daughter scout waves, since they are indistinguishable!  

In standard quantum mechanical formalism we add amplitudes for indistinguishable events and 
multiply  them  for  distinguishable  (independent)  events.  The  same  we  do  for  scout  wave  threads  in 
hidden time theory! 
 
3 

Next, imagine that each one – photon scout wave in each bunch behaves just the same we 
described above: it travels to appropriate detector and is (possibly) summed there with identical 
copies  of  itself  (if  any)1,  like  it  takes  place  in  simple  interference.  Then  that  detector  sends  a 
query wave with intensity equal to squared sum of received scout waves.  

 
   

 
Fig 5c 
Output states compete as independent units 

 

 

 

Previously we suggested that the phase is inessential for a query wave. Let us now assume that 
it  is  not  so:  a  query  wave  has  phase  variable,  but  it  is  constant  along  the  way  back  from  appropriate 
detector,  and  equal  to  the  phase  of  scout  wave  at  this  detector.  So  each  (one  –  photon)  query  wave 
provides a standard (one - photon!) quantum mechanical amplitude for a particular detector. 

 
When any (one – photon) query wave comes from its detector to bunch connection knot 
(green  circle  in  Fig.  5b)  it  meets  its  partner  within  the  bunch.  Amplitudes  of  both  waves  are 
multiplied  as  complex  numbers.  So  we  get  each  of  the  values  of 
  to  be 
physically calculated in hidden time.

bunched thread can divide and converge along its way like in 1 – photon Mach – Zehnder interferometer. 

9

The following is quite trivial: bunched states compete to each other just like we discussed 
above for ordinary query waves in one – photon experiment (Fig. 5c). This competition leads for 
some single bunched state to win, and each detector gets its photon (if any) for this winner state. 
 
 
 

IV. 

Entanglement: change of basis 

 
 
1 
I want to argue that hidden time model of entanglement does not simply looks like true 
 
quantum  entanglement,  but  is  exactly  equivalent  to  what  quantum  mechanics  provides.  Let  we 
have an entangled two – component system: 
 

=Ψ

(8).

Let we change observation basis in the following way: 

 

If  0  and  1  denote polarization states, then such change of basis means that we rotate 

optical axes of crystals we use by 

 counterclockwise. From these equations we find that

So in (X, Y) basis we get the same entangled state (change of overall phase by π has no 
physical sense) as in (0, 1) basis. It is crucial for us here whether hidden time model is able to 
reproduce this feature of standard quantum theory. 
 
 
 

10

 
 
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 

 

I suggest that such change of basis makes no difficulties for hidden time approach. Since 

2 
 
at the input and output of a beam splitter we have  0  and  1  ket states only, we have no any 
changes of hidden time signals until they reach optical devices (birefringent crystals). In other 
words, in hidden time we have  H V  single – photon waves and the same bunched waves for 
two photons as before:

Next, if we rotate the crystal located at the 1’ path, it is exactly this location, after which 
 
'1H  or 
extraordinary  e  waves – Fig. 6.   
 
 

'1V  scout wave (alone or within a bunch) is split into sum of ordinary  o  and

Married |H1’> scout wave is split by birefringent crystal into married |o> and |e> scout waves, each of half 
intensity 
 

 

Like before,  o  and  e  scout waves propagate to detectors, then come back to splitting 

point, i.e. the birefringent crystal we use, and compete there. Next, regardless of which of two

intensity and phase, to the beam splitter we use to compete there with other bunched (married) 
states we have in the system.  

 propagates backward with its own 

VH

'2

In other words, from hidden time viewpoint, change of basis at detection location does 

not affect competition of initial scout waves. 

So, within hidden time approach, entanglement is indeed independent of change of basis. 
 
  

V. 

Entanglement: delayed choice 

From previous description it should be clear that using time – varying analyzers in 

entanglement experiments, like in classical experimental work [5], brings no new challenge to 
hidden time approach. 

The core idea is very simple:  
 

 
 

 

 

 

11

•  1st, scout waves find all detectors and “frozen” physical states of all devices involved, the 

very time is “frozen”; 

•  2nd, scout waves come back to their sources and compete their; 
•  3rd, winner waves return to appropriate detectors and “unfrozen the time”. 
 
This general scheme just ignores our naive tricks with fast switching of analyzers. We think 

we are fast to switch the devices we use, but hidden does not think so.   

VI. 

Conclusions 

 
 

 

 
It  is  notable  that  the  idea  of  back  propagation  was  formulated  not  once  to  interpret 
quantum mechanics [6, 7]. Still, the idea of hidden time, which a trivial and obvious next step, 
was not yet formulated. 
 
Hidden  time  can  be  much  more  than  simply  an  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics; 
instead, it pretends to be the underlying dynamics. Why? Because hidden time model introduces 
some new and unexpected functions for charges: hidden time says something on how a charge 
works with light. 

I can’t invent any simple but serious reason why hidden time can not be the whole new 
basis for building dynamical model of quantum phenomena, so brightly described by standard 
quantum mechanical formalism. 

And I suggest that any efficient criticism of hidden time should contain such simple but 

serious loopholes of the approach.  

So I invite theorists to beat hidden time as strong as possible.

Abstract

We determine the class of damped modes ˜y which are related to the common free damping
modes y by supersymmetry. They are obtained by employing the factorization of Newton’s
diﬀerential equation of motion for the free damped oscillator by means of the general solu-
tion of the corresponding Riccati equation together with Witten’s method of constructing
the supersymmetric partner operator. This procedure introduces one-parameter families of
(transient) modes for each of the three types of free damping, corresponding to a particular
type of anti-restoring acceleration (adding up to the usual Hooke restoring acceleration) of
the form a(t) = 2γ
(γt+1)2 ˜y, where γ is the family parameter that has been chosen as the in-
verse of the Riccati integration constant. In supersymmetric terms, they represent all those
damping modes having the same free damping partner mode.

The damped oscillator (DO) is a cornerstone of physics and a primary textbook example in

classical mechanics. Schemes of analogies allow its extension to many areas of physics where

the same basic concepts occur with merely a change in the meaning of the symbols. Appar-

ently, there might hardly be anything new to say about such an obvious case. However, in the

following we would like to exhibit a new and nice feature of damping resulting from the math-

ematical procedure of factorization of its diﬀerential equation. In the past, the factorization of

the DO diﬀerential equation (Newton’s law) has been tackled by a few authors [1] but not in

the framework that will be presented herein. Namely, recalling that such factorizations are com-

mon tools in Witten’s supersymmetric quantum mechanics [2] and imply particular solutions of

Riccati equations known as superpotentials, we would like to explore here the factoring of the

DO equation by means of the general solution of the Riccati equation, a procedure which has

been ﬁrst used in physics by Mielnik [3] for the quantum harmonic oscillator. In other words,

we shall exploit the non-uniqueness of the factorization of second-order diﬀerential operators,

on the example of the classical damped oscillator. We write the ordinary DO Newton’s law in

i.e., we already added a β2y term in both sides in order to perform the factoring. The coeﬃcient

2β is the friction constant per unit mass and ω0 is the natural frequency of the oscillator. The

It follows that y± = e−βt±αt and one can build through their superposition the general solution

as y = e−βt(Aeαt + Be−αt). Thus, for free underdamping, the general solution can be written as

Let us now write the more general factorization

By inspection, one can easily see that a ﬁrst solution to this equation is f (t) = β (g(t) = β),

which is the common case discussed by all the previous authors [1]. Changing the dependent

variable to h(t) = f (t)

′
β, we get a simpler form of the Riccati equation, i.e., h

(t) + h2 = 0,

with the particular solution h(t) = 0. However, the general solution is h(t) = 1

one can easily check. The constant of integration T = 1/γ occurs as a new time scale in the

problem, see below. Therefore there is the more general factorization of the DO equation as

This new second-order damping operator contains the additional last term with respect to its

initial partner, which roughly speaking is the Darboux transform term [4] of the quadratic

operator. The important property of this operator is the following. If y0 is an eigenfunction of
Ng, then A−y0 is an eigenfunction of ˜Ng since ˜NgA−y0 = A−A+A−y0 = A−Ngy0 and Ngy0 =

α2y0 implying ˜Ng(A−y0) = A−Ngy0 = α2(A−y0). The conclusion is that ˜Ng has the same type

of “spectrum” as Ng, and therefore as N . The eigenfunctions ˜y± can be constructed if one knows

the eigenfunctions y± as follows

These modes make up a one-parameter family of damping eigenfunctions that we interpret as

Examination of this law shows that the term 2γ2/(γt + 1)2 ˜y can be interpreted as a time-

dependent anti-restoring acceleration (because of the minus sign in front of it) producing in the

transient period t

1/β the damping modes given by ˜y above.

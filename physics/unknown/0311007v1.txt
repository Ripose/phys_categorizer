Abstract.  The  paper  contains  the  review  of  a  number  of  wide-angle  polarization 
CCD-measurements  of  the  twilight  sky  in  V  and  R  color  bands  with  effective 
wavelengths  equal  to  550  and  700  nm.  The  basic  factors  effecting  (usually 
decreasing)  on  the  polarization  of  the  twilight  sky  are  the  atmospheric  aerosol 
scattering  and  multiple  scattering.  The  method  of  multiple  scattering  separation  is 
being considered. The results are compared with the data of numerical simulation of 
radiation transfer in the atmosphere for different aerosol models. The whole twilight 
period  is  divided  on  the  different  stages  with  different  mechanisms  forming  the 
twilight sky polarization properties. 
 
Keywords: polarization, multiple scattering, atmospheric aerosol. 
 
1. Introduction 

The efficiency of the twilight observations for the atmosphere investigations was paid 
much attention long time ago and such early as in 1923 the twilight probing method 
became  the  subject  of  detailed  analysis  [1]. The difference with the daytime period, 
when  the  sky  background  is  being  formed  by  the  light  scattering  in  the  lower 
troposphere layers, is accelerating elevation of the Earth’s shadow over the observer 
and, thus, fast increasing of the effective scattering altitude. This gives the possibility 
of the retrieval of the scattering and absorption coefficient vertical profile, which can 
be useful for the investigations of aerosol and small admixtures in the atmosphere. 

However, in the same paper [1] the basic problem of this method was specified. This 
problem is related with the solar light experienced two or more acts of scattering in the 
atmosphere, or multiple scattering. The process takes place in the dense lower layers of 
the atmosphere, and this twilight background component can be even brighter than the 
light scattered one time in the upper atmosphere. The reduction of multiple scattering 
based on some observational or theoretical methods is quite difficult task and it became 
the  reason  of  sufficient  differences  of  results  obtained  by  different  authors  [2].  The 
possibility of exact numerical analysis appeared only in the last years. 

UGOLNIKOV, POSTYLYAKOV, MASLOV 

In the paper [3] the high possible efficiency of polarization measurements of the 
twilight  sky  was  noticed.  The  polarization  data  help  to  separate  the  single  and 
multiple  scattering,  since  the  polarization  of  multiply  scattered  light  is  lower.  This 
became the base of the method of single and multiple scattering separation suggested 
in  [4].  Polarization  measurements  are  effective  for  atmospheric  aerosol  sounding, 
and now POLDER space instrument [5] and AERONET ground network had started 
such observations. But since the aerosol scattering has the depolarization properties 
too, it can be mixed up with multiple scattering, this situation unfortunately taking 
place in a number of papers in 20th century.  

In  this  paper  we  will  consider  the  results  of  polarization  measurements  of  the 
twilight  sky  in  different  spectral  regions,  compare  it  with  the  data  of  numerical 
simulation and establish the relation between the sky polarization evolution with the 
Sun depression and the contribution of atmospheric aerosol and multiple scattering.  

 

2. Observations 

The  polarization  twilight  sky  observations  were  conducted  in  2002-2003  at  South 
Laboratory  Of  Moscow  Sternberg  Astronomical  Institute,  situated  in  the  Crimea, 
Ukraine. The observation device was the CCD-camera with short-focus lens and rotating 
polarization filter. The device axis was directed to the zenith, and the field of view was 
about 8.4x6.3 degrees. It was possible to hold the measurements from the day, when the 
Sun was above the horizon, till the nightfall. The procedure of star identification with the 
Tycho-2 star catalogue [6] made possible to exclude the stars up to 12m and to hold the 
photometry  of  bright  stars  for  atmospheric  transparency  estimation  at  nighttime 
images.  During  the  sessions  in  November-December  2002  and  April  2003  the 
observations were carried out in V wide color band with the effective wavelength equal 
to  550  nm,  and  in  April-June  and  September  2003  the  twilight  background  was 
measured in R band with effective wavelength equal to 700 nm. The observations were 
similar  to  UBVR-measurements  conducted  in  the  same  place  in  summer  2000  and 
described in [4] but with the more field of view (about 29x22 degrees). 
 
3. Radiation transfer calculations and models 

A  simulation  of  the  twilight  polarized  radiance  was  performed  by  using  a  Monte-
Carlo linear radiation transfer model MCC++ [7]. This model calculates the radiation 
transfer  with  account  of  polarization  in  the  spherical  shell  atmosphere  taking  into 
account all orders of scattering, aerosol and Rayleigh scattering, aerosol and gaseous 
absorption  and  surface  albedo.  The  code  was  validated  against  other  radiation 
transfer model for the twilight observations [8]. Calculations were carried out for the 

solar depressions under horizon up to 6° for the same wavelengths where 2000-2003 
observations were made: 360, 440, 550 and 700 nm.

The  calculations  were  made  for  gaseous  atmosphere  with  Rayleigh  scattering 
matrix  and  for  three  standard  aerosol  models  with  microphysical  characteristics 
proposed by WMO [9] and given in the Table 1: the urban, continental and maritime 
types of aerosol from 0 to 10 km and stratospheric aerosol above 10 km for all three 
cases.  The  phase  matrix,  absorption  and  scattering  cross  sections  of  aerosol  were 
calculated by using Mie theory. The MODTRAN aerosol extinction profile at 600 nm, 
corresponding to surface visible range 50 km and background stratospheric aerosol, 
was  used.  Rayleigh  extinction  profile  at  550  nm  is  taken  from  [10],  the  wavelength 

dependence  was  assumed  as  λ–4,  and  the  depolarization  factor  was  ignored.  The 
Krueger  model  of  atmospheric  ozone  with  total  content  345  DU  was  used. 
Lambertian surface albedo was assumed to be equal to 0.5. 

 

 

4. Multiple scattering separation method 

A  method  of  single  and  multiple  scattered  light  separation  using  observations  of 
polarization  of  twilight  sky  is  described  in  details  in  [4].  The  simplified  idea  of  the 
method follows. When the Sun is situated near the horizon, the maximum polarization 

point  of  single  scattering  should  be  situated  about  90°  from  it  (or  exactly  90°  if  the 
scattering  is  molecular)  or  near  the  zenith.  And  as  the  Sun  is  depressing,  this  point 
follows  it  by  the  vertical  to  the  glow  segment,  remaining  at  the  constant  angular 
distance from the Sun (since the effective scattering altitude is not yet changing rapidly 
at the sunset moment). The maximum polarization point for multiple scattering at the 
sunset  is  expected  to  be  near  the  zenith  too,  but  as  the  secondary  light  source  is  the 
whole sky and basically, the glow area, and not directly related with the Sun, this point 
should be practically immovable remaining near the zenith. And thus, the position of 
the maximum polarization point for the total sky background will be the reflection of 
the changes of single and multiple scattering balance.

Figure  1  shows  the  dependence  of  the  maximum  polarization  point  zenith 
distance,  zP,  on  the  sun  depression  under  horizon,  h  (this  value  is  negative  at  the 
daytime) for one date of simultaneous observations in 550 and 700 nm in 2000 [4]. 
The dashed line is corresponding to the case of pure Rayleigh single scattering. We 
can see that at the daytime and light phase of twilight until the Sun depression about 

5°,  the  maximum  polarization  point  really  follows  the  Sun,  but  the  velocity  of  such 
motion is lower a bit than for the case of pure single scattering. It points to almost 
constant  ratio  of  single  and  multiple  scattering  at  this  time.  And  then  this  point  is 
turning  back  to  the  zenith,  and  polarization  profile  of  the  solar  vertical  becomes 
symmetric relatively the zenith. It can be related only with the single scattering light 
disappearing on the background of multiple scattering. 

A  mathematical  procedure  of  the  multiple  scattering  separation  method  is 
described in [4]. This procedure uses the polarization data of light incoming from a few 
near-zenith  directions  for  a  few  solar  depressions  during  twilight,  calculating  the 
derivative values of sky polarization on the solar depression and zenith distance of the 
observation  point.  Method  works  if  the  contribution  of  single  aerosol  scattering  is 
small (the influence of aerosol on multiple scattering can be sufficient and it is not a 
problem). As it was shown in [4] and will be visible below, it is true for the most part of 
cases at 550 nm and shorter wavelengths, where the effective single scattering at light 
twilight period takes place in the stratosphere. But at 700 nm the single troposphere 
aerosol scattering is sufficient and the exactness of the method decreases.

The application of this method to the results of observations in summer 2000 [4] 
had shown that single scattering contribution decreases for the shorter wavelengths. 
Figure  2  shows  the  values  of  single  scattering  contribution  at  the  zenith  at  the 
moment of sunrise or sunset (dots) compared with the results of calculations by the 
MCC++ code for different aerosol models (lines). Figure shows the good agreement 
of results of the observational method and radiation transfer simulations. 

 

5. Observation results 

5.1. Results in V band (550 nm) 

Figure  3  shows  the  dependencies  of  sky  polarization  at  the  zenith,  p,  on  the  solar 
depression under the horizon, h, for a sample of 6 observation dates in 2000-2003 
compared  with  the  ones  numerically  simulated  by  the  MCC++  model  (bold  lines). 
For any observation date, the twilight period can be divided to three sub-periods with 
different  behavior  of  sky  polarization.  From  the  sunset  until  the  sun  depression 

about 5° the polarization is almost constant, then it begins to decrease and after the 

Sun  depression  about  9°  in  the  moonless  sky  the  polarization  becomes  constant 

again  (it  takes  place  until  the  depressions  about  12-13°  when  the  night  sky 

contribution  becomes  noticeable).  The  nature  of  this  evolution  is  related  with  the 
changes  of  the  ratio  of  single  and  multiple  scattering  contribution,  which  is  almost 

 5

UGOLNIKOV, POSTYLYAKOV, MASLOV 

constant  at  light  period  of  twilight,  then  the  contribution  of  single  scattering  is 

decreasing  completely  vanishing  at  the  Sun  depression  about  9°.  In  the  same  time 

the  values  of  polarization  of  the  single  and  multiple  scattering  components 
themselves  are  changing  very  slowly.  Here  we  should  note  that  by  the  same  reason 
the twilight sky color has the similar behavior, getting blue at the time of polarization 
decrease [4]. 

The most interesting fact is that all curves in the figure are quite similar and just 
shifted one from another, in spite of the fact that observations were made in different 
years and seasons. It is true not only for dates shown in the figure, but for all ones in 
V  band  too.  The  same  may  be  said  about  the  theoretical  curves.  The  value  of  sky 
polarization at the zenith at the light twilight period is unequivocally related with the 
one at the dark period when the twilight background consists of multiple scattering. 
It  points  to  the  fact  that  in  V  color  band  the  changes  of  the  atmospheric  aerosol 
influence  on  the  twilight  sky  polarization  only  through  the  multiple  scattering 
component,  and  its  influence  being  the  same  for  all  twilight  stages.  This  fact  is 
confirming  the  assumption  about  low  contribution  of  single  aerosol  scattering  in 
yellow and shorter-wave spectral regions [4]. It is also pointed by the constant value 
of sky polarization during the whole light twilight period with wide range of effective 
scattering altitudes.

The traces of single aerosol scattering appear only at h<0, or when the Sun rises 
above  the  horizon,  for  the  dates  with  weak  sky  polarization  and  low  atmosphere 
transparency.  This  time  the  aerosol  in  the  lower  layers  of  the  atmosphere  is 
becoming  radiated  by  straight  solar  light  without  strong  absorption.  It  is  visible  in 
Figure  3  by  the  polarization  decrease  at  h<0  for  these  dates.  The  effect  is  not  so 
strong, but as we can see below, in R color band, where the atmospheric absorption 
and effective scattering altitude are lower, it will be sufficient even during the twilight 
period at h>0. 

The observational data for the dates with pure atmosphere and high polarization 
are  in  good  agreement  with  the  dependencies  obtained  by  radiation  transfer 
simulations,  especially  for  urban  aerosol  model.  But  we  should  remember  that  this 
model  data  are  very  sensitive  to  the  parameters  and  concentration  of  tropospheric 
aerosol forming the multiple scattering component and its small changes will move 
the curves in Figure 3 up or down practically without changing their shapes. 

 

5.2. Results in R band (700 nm) 

Figure  4  shows  the  same  dependencies  of  sky  polarization  at  the  zenith  on  the 
depression of Sun for the sample of 5 observation dates at 700 nm. Despite of the fact 
that  these  observations  were  made  during  the  5  days  period  in  2003,  the  sufficient 
differences between the results are easy to see. The curves of the mornings of 30.04 
and 01.05 are similar to the ones observed in V band and shown in Figure 3, but at 
other dates the polarization decreasing takes place not only at the daytime, but in the 

light  twilight  period  until  the  depression  of  Sun  about  3°  too.  Just  after  that  the 

twilight  sky  polarization  becomes  principally  the  same  for  the  dates  shown  in  the 

figure.  After  the  Sun  depression  about  5°  the  polarization  fall  related  with  the 

increase  of  multiple  scattering  contribution  starts,  but  there  is  no  plateau  at  the 

depressions  about  10°  like  the  one  in  V  band.  In  the  moonless  conditions  the 

polarization  is  monotonously  decreasing  until  the  nightfall.  It  is  related  with  less 
intensity  of  multiple  scattering  and  more  intensity  of  night  sky  background  in  this 
spectral region. 

Figure  5  shows  the  dependencies  of  sky  brightness  at  the  zenith  on  the 
depression of Sun for the same sample of observations in April – May 2003. We can 
see that in the daytime period (h<0) the brightness excess appears for the same dates 
when polarization is decreasing. This is obviously related with single scattering at the 
aerosol particles in the troposphere, the concentration of which is variable from day 
to  day.  But  the  effect  of  brightness  excess  appears  only  at  h<0,  although  the 

polarization  decrease  at  these  dates  is  visible  also  during  the  twilight  at  h<3°.  To 

explain it, we should remember that the aerosol reveals itself not only by additional 

 

8

Effects of aerosol and multiple scattering on the polarization of the twilight sky 

scattering, but also by additional absorption. In the light twilight period these effects 
compensate each other, twilight sky brightness is almost independent on the aerosol 
contribution,  which  can  be  detected  only  by  polarization  measurements.  When  the 
Sun  is  above  the  horizon,  the  influence  of  aerosol  absorption  is  less  and  the 
brightness excess appears. 

In  the  Figure  6  we  can  see  the  solar  depression  dependency  of  correlation 
coefficient  CJP  between  brightness  logarithm  and  sky  polarization  calculated  basing 
on the whole observational data in 2002-2003 in V and R bands. Being absent at the 
moment h=0, the anti-correlation of brightness logarithm and polarization in R band 

rapidly appears with sunrise, reaching 0.95 when the Sun is 3° above the horizon!  In 

V band, where the absorption is stronger, the anti-correlation is less and it appears 

only at the Sun elevation about 3°.  

Strong and variable influence of absorption does not give the possibility of direct 
measurement of the contribution and polarization of single aerosol scattering being 
based  on  this  correlation  and  assuming  that  its  intensity  equal  to  the  observed 
brightness excess.

Bold lines in the Figure 4, as in the Figure 3 for V band, are corresponding to the 
results of numerical simulations for gaseous atmosphere and three standard aerosol 
models.  The  difference  between  shapes  of  theoretical  and  observational  curves  as 
well  as  the  difference  of  observational  curves  with  each  other  is  worthy  of  note.  As 
against  the  multiple  scattering,  which  is  just  shifting  the  curves  up  or  down,  the 
single  aerosol  scattering  that  is  sufficient  in  R  band  changes  also  their  shape  that 
thus becomes a function of the vertical aerosol distribution. 

6. Conclusions 

The  primary  goal  of  this  work  is  a  qualitative  analysis  of  the  observed  polarization 
features of the twilight sky for different wavelengths and twilight stages from the day 
till night. It was made to find out which depolarizing factor – multiple scattering or 
atmospheric  aerosol  –  is  the  principal  in  this  or  that  situation.  This  question  is 
important  for  choose  of  the  observational  technique  and  the  method  of  aerosol 
properties retrieval based on the twilight sky polarization data. 

For  any  wavelength  in  visible  part  of  spectrum  and  for  any  amount  of  Sun 
depression  under  horizon  the  atmospheric  aerosol  makes  sufficient  contribution  to 
the  intensity  of  multiple  scattering  component.  But  this  is  difficult  to  use  in  the 
retrieval methods. The observable signs of single aerosol scattering appear at definite 
Sun depression (or elevation) and can be observed only when the Sun is higher than 
this level. And just in red (and infrared) part of spectrum this period covers the light 
stage of twilight. The dependency of polarization on the Sun depression becomes the 
function  of  vertical  aerosol  distribution,  and  possibility  of  reverse  task  solution 
appears.  At  the  same  wavelengths  the  multiple  scattering  contribution  decreases 
causing less problems for retrieval algorithms. Shorter wavelengths data are simpler 
for  qualitative  and  quantitative  analysis  [4],  but  the  contribution  of  single  aerosol 
scattering at those wavelengths is many times weaker.

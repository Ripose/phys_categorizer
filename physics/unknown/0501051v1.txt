Abstract
That the speed of light is always c (≈300,000 km/s) relative to any observer in
nonaccelerating  motion  is  one  of  the  foundational  concepts  of  physics.
Experimentally  this  was  supposed  to  have  been  first  revealed  by  the  1887
Michelson-Morley experiment, and was made one of Einstein’s key postulates
of Special Relativity in 1905.  However in 2002 the actual 1887 fringe shift data
was analysed for the first time with a theory for the Michelson interferometer
that used both the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction effect, as well as the effect of
the  air  on  the  speed  of  light.  That  analysis  showed  that  the  data  gave  an
absolute motion speed in excess of 300 km/s. So far six other experiments have
been  shown  to  give  the  same  result.    This  implies  that  the  foundations  of
physics  require  significant  revision.  As  well  data  shows  that  both  Newtonian
gravity  and  General  Relativity  are  also  seriously  flawed,  and  a  new  theory  of
gravity  is  shown  to  explain  various  so-called  gravitational  `anomalies’,
including  the    `dark  matter’  effect.      So  the  centenary  of  Einstein’s  Special
Relativity turns out to be also its demise.  Most importantly absolute motion is
now understood to be the cause of the various relativistic effects, in complete
contradiction  with  the  Einstein  viewpoint,  but  in  accord  with  the  earlier
proposal by Lorentz.

Introduction
Physicists have believed for more than 100 years that the speed of light was the
same  for  all  nonaccelerating  observers.  This  is  one  of  the  postulates  that
Einstein  proposed  in  1905,  with  the  first  experimental  evidence  supposed  to
have  been  based  upon  the  results  of  the  Michelson-Morley  1887  experiment.
However  a  re-analysis  in  2002  of  the  fringe-shift  data  from  that  experiment
showed that the data indicated a speed in excess of 300 km/s. So far another six
experiments have been found that also revealed a similar speed. It means that
space has a substructure, that absolute motion is observable, that the spacetime
construct has no ontological meaning, despite its use in quantum field theory,
and that it is absolute motion that causes the various relativistic effects, as first

suggested  by  Lorentz.  These  discoveries  have  profound  implications  for  the
foundations  of  physics  and  for  our  understanding  of  reality.  Einstein  asserted
that  that  there  is  no  preferred  frame,  that  there  is  no  detectable  space, that a
three-dimensional  space  has  no  physical  existence.    However  all  through  the
last 100 years and more the experimental data was indicating that this assertion
was  invalid.    Here  a  brief  review  of  that  data  is  presented  along  with  another
recent discovery, namely that our understanding of gravity was flawed from the
very  beginning,  for  it  is  now  clear  that  Newtonian  gravity  is  valid  only  in
special  situations,  and  that  the  Einstein  theory  of  gravity,  known  as  General
Relativity, inherited these flaws, as discussed herein.

The  Einstein  postulates  were  first  formulated  in  1905  and  have  played  a
fundamental  role  in  limiting  the  form  of  subsequent  physical  theories,  and  in
also  defining  our  comprehension  of  reality.    They  lead  to  the  concept  of
spacetime,  and  that  a  curved  spacetime  explained  gravity.  They  also  lead
physicists to reject any evidence that was revealing that the postulates were in
disagreement with experimental data. In physics they have become a vigorously
defended belief  system, and any  discussion of the numerous experiments  that
indicate their failure is banned.

Einstein postulates:
(1) The laws of physics have the same form in all inertial reference frames.
(2) Light propagates through empty space with a definite speed c independent
of the speed of the observer (or source).
(3) In the limit of low speeds the gravity formalism should agree with
Newtonian gravity.

The putative successes of the postulates lead to the almost universal acceptance
of the Einstein Special Theory of Relativity, which is based upon the concept of
a  flat  four-dimensional  spacetime  ontology  that  replaces  the  older  separate
concepts of space and time, and then to the General Theory of Relativity with
its  curved  spacetime  model  for  gravity.  While  the  relativistic  effects  are  well
established experimentally it is was dramatically understood in 2002 [4,10] that
numerous  experiments,  beginning  with  the  Michelson-Morley  experiment  [1]
of 1887, have always shown that postulates (1) and (2) (excepting the 2nd part)
are false, namely that there is a detectable physical local frame of reference or
`space', and that the solar system has a large observed galactic velocity of some
420±30km/s  in  the  direction  (RA=5.2hr,  Dec=  -67deg)  through  this  space
[2,3,5,8,10].  This  is  different  from  the  speed  of  369km/s  in  the  direction
(RA=11.20hr,  Dec=  -7.22deg)  extracted  from  the  Cosmic  Microwave
Background  (CMB)  anisotropy,  and  which  describes  a  motion  relative  to  the
distant universe, but not relative to the local space. This paper briefly reviews
the  experimental  evidence  regarding  the  failure  of  the  postulates,  and  the
implications for our understanding of fundamental physics, and in particular for
our understanding of gravity.  A new theory of gravity is seen to be necessary,
and  this  results  in  an  explanation  of  the  `dark  matter'  effect,  entailing  the

3

discovery  that  the  fine  structure  constant  is  a  2nd  gravitational  constant  [2-
4,6,7].  This  theory  is  a  part  of  the  information-theoretic  modelling  of  reality
known  as  Process  Physics  [2-4,9],  which  premises  a  non-geometric  process
model  of  time,  as  distinct  from  the  current  non-Process  Physics,  which  is
characterised by a geometrical model of time.

Detecting Absolute Motion in 1887
The  first  detection  of  absolute  motion,  that  is  motion  relative  to  space  itself,
was actually by Michelson and Morley in 1887. However they totally bungled
the reporting of their own data, an achievement that Michelson managed again
and again throughout his life-long search for experimental evidence of absolute
motion.  The Michelson interferometer was a brilliantly conceived instrument
for  the  detection  of  absolute  motion,  but  only  in  2002  was  its  principle  of
operation finally understood and used to analyse, for the first time ever, the data
from the 1887 experiment, despite the enormous impact of that experiment on
the foundations of physics, particularly as they were laid down, erroneously as
we  now  understand,  by  Einstein.    So  great  was  Einstein’s  influence  that  the
1887  data  was  never  re-analysed  post-1905  using  a  proper  relativistic-effects
based  theory  for  the  interferometer.    For  that  reason  modern-day  vacuum
Michelson  interferometer  experiments  are  badly  conceived,  and  their  null
results  continue  to  cause  much  confusion:  only  a  Michelson  interferometer  in
the gas-mode can detect absolute motion, as we now see.

The  Michelson  interferometer,  Fig.1,  compares  the  change  in  the  difference
between  travel  times,  when  the  device  is  rotated,  for  two  coherent  beams  of
light  that  travel  in  orthogonal  directions  between  mirrors;  the  changing  time
difference  being  indicated  by  the  shift  of  the  interference  fringes  during  the
rotation.    This  effect  is  caused  by  the  absolute  motion  of  the  device  through
space  with  speed v .  The  post  relativistic-effects  theory  for  this  device  is
remarkably simple.  The Fitzgerald–Lorentz contraction effect causes the arm
AB parallel to the absolute velocity to be physically contracted to length

solids  a  more  complex  phenomenon  occurs  and  rotation  fringe  shifts  from
absolute motion do not occur). A more general analysis [2,3], including Fresnel

Michelson used. The interferometers are operated with the arms horizontal, as
shown by Miller’s interferometer in Fig.2. Then in (2) θ is the azimuth of one
arm relative to the local meridian, while ψ is the azimuth of the absolute motion
velocity  projected  onto  the  plane  of  the  interferometer,  with  projected
component v P .  Here  the  Fitzgerald-Lorentz  contraction  is  a  real  dynamical
effect of absolute motion, unlike the Einstein spacetime view that it is merely a
mathematical  artefact,  and  whose  magnitude  depends  on  the  choice  of
observer.

The Michelson and Morley air-mode interferometer fringe shift data revealed a
speed of some 8km/s [1,4,10] when analysed using the prevailing but incorrect
Newtonian  theory  which  has  k 2
1≈   in  (2);  and  this  value  was  known  to
Michelson  and  Morley.  The  often-repeated  statement  that  Michelson  and
Morley did not see any rotation induced fringe shifts is completely wrong; all
physicists  should  read  their  paper  [1]  for  a  re-education.  They  rejected  their
own data on the sole but spurious ground that the detected 8km/s was smaller
than  the  speed  of  the  earth  about  the  sun  of  30km/s.    What  their  result  really
showed was that (i) absolute motion had been detected, and (ii) that the theory
giving  k 2
1≈   was  wrong.  Michelson  and  Morley  in  1887  should  have
announced that the speed of light did depend of the direction of travel, that the
speed c  was relative to an actual physical space.  It was Miller [5] who saw the
flaw in the 1887 paper and, while not having a theory for the value of  k 2 ,  he
used  the  effect,  throughout  a  year  in  1925/26  and  making  20,000  rotations  of
the interferometer at Mt. Wilson, of the changing vector addition of the earth’s
orbital  velocity  and  the  absolute  galactic  velocity  of  the  solar  system  to
determine the numerical value of  k 2 , and determined the first estimate for the
absolute linear velocity of the solar system.

Including  the  Fitzgerald-Lorentz  dynamical  contraction  effect  as  well  as  the
effect of the gas present we find that  k 2
 for air, which explains why
the observed fringe shifts were so small.  In the Einstein theory  k = 0 ; absolute
motion is to be undetectable in principle. Fig.3 shows data from averaging the

fringe  shifts  from  20  rotations  of  the  Miller  interferometer,  performed  over  a
short period of time, and clearly shows the expected form in (2) (only a linear
drift  caused  by  temperature  effects  on  the  arm  lengths  has  been  removed).  In
Fig.3  the  fringe  shifts  during  rotation  are  given  as  fractions  of  a  wavelength,
= t T , where ∆t  is given by (3) and  T  is the period of the light. Such
λ λ/
∆
rotation induced fringe shifts clearly show that the speed of light is different in
different directions. The claim that Michelson interferometers, operating in gas-
mode, do not produce fringe shifts under rotation is clearly nonsense.  But it is
that  claim  that  lead  to  the  continuing  belief,  within  physics,  that  absolute
motion  had  never  been  detected,  and  that  the  speed  of  light  is  invariant.  The
value of ψ from such rotations together lead to plots like those in Fig.4, which
show  ψ  from  the  1925/1926  Miller  [5]  interferometer  data  for  four  different
months of the year, from which the RA = 5.2hr is readily apparent. While the
orbital motion of the earth about the sun slightly affects the RA in each month,
and  Miller  used  this  effect  do  determine  the  value  of  k ,  the  new  theory  of
gravity  required  a  reanalysis  of  the  data  [2-4,8],  giving  the  above  absolute
velocity.  Two old interferometer experiments, by Illingworth (1927) and Joos
(1930),  used  helium,  enabling  the  refractive  index  effect  to  be  recently
confirmed. The data from an interferometer experiment by Jaseja  et al (1964)
using two orthogonal masers also indicates that they detected absolute motion,
but were not aware of that as they used the incorrect Newtonian theory and so
considered the fringe shifts to be too small to be real, reminiscent of the same
mistake by Michelson and Morley

Fig.5 shows the NS orientated coaxial cable RF travel time variations measured
by DeWitte in 1991, which gives the same RA [2-4,8]. That experiment showed
that RF EM waves travel at speeds determined by the orientation of the cable
relative  to  the  Miller  direction;  in  complete  contradiction  to  the  Einstein
postulate. That these very different experiments show the same speed and RA
of absolute motion is one of the most startling but suppressed discoveries of the
twentieth century. Torr and Kolen (1981) using an EW orientated nitrogen gas-
filled  coaxial  cable  also  detected  absolute  motion.    It  should  be  noted  that
analogous  optical  fibre  experiments  give  null  results  for  the  same  reason,
apparently, that transparent solids in a Michelson interferometer also give null
results.

So Postulates (1) and (2) are in disagreement with the experimental data. In all
some  seven  experiments  have  detected  this  absolute  motion.  Modern
interferometer  experiments  use  vacuum  with n = 1,  and  then  from  (2)  k = 0 ,
predicting  no  rotation-induced  fringe  shifts.    In  analysing  the  data  from  these
experiments the consequent null effect is misinterpreted to imply the absence of
absolute  motion.  As  discussed  in  [2-4]  it  is  absolute motion which causes the
dynamical  effects  of  length  contractions,  time  dilations  and  other  relativistic
effects, in accord with Lorentzian interpretation of relativistic effects.

A New Theory of Gravity and the Fine Structure Constant
We  now  come  to  postulate  (3)  for  gravity.    This  postulate  relates  General
Relativity  to  Newtonian  gravity,  and  Newtonian  gravity  is  now  known  to  be
seriously flawed, and so ipso facto, by using this postulate, Einstein and Hilbert
inadvertently  developed  a  flawed  theory  of  gravity.  Newtonian  gravity  was
based upon Kepler's Laws for the planetary motions within the solar system and
uses the acceleration field  g r t
G4π ρ                                                                                   (3)

The velocity field formalism (4)-(5) is mathematically equivalent to (3);
because they give the same acceleration field. However it is the velocity field
formalism that turns out to be more fundamental because (i) it is observable,
and (ii) it cannot be determined from the observed acceleration field. However
(4), unlike (3), is not uniquely determined by Kepler's laws because

as  a  phenomenological  treatment  of  the  new  spatial  dynamics  within  the
velocity field formulation of Newtonian gravity. It is this spatial dynamics that
has been misinterpreted as the `dark matter' effect.  However the dynamics in
(8)  cannot  be  written  in  terms  of  a  closed  form  like  (3)  for  the  acceleration
field;  the  `dark-matter’  effect  is  only  describable  in  a  closed  form  using  the
velocity field formalism.  So from the very beginning the Newtonian theory of
gravity  missed  a  major  dynamical  aspect  of  the  phenomenon  of  gravity.  This
`dark  matter'  dynamical  effect  also  appears  to  explain  the  long-standing
problems in measuring  G  in Cavendish-type experiments, as shown in Fig.7.

which is characterised by their almost flat asymptotic limit.  This rotation curve
explains the `dark matter' effect as seen in spiral galaxies, as shown in Fig.8.
Such black holes can exist independent of matter ( K = 0), and are not formed
by an in-fall of matter (as are black holes in GR); they can be primordial, that
is, formed during the big bang. Such black holes act as the kernels of spiral
galaxies which are formed, early in the history of the universe, by subsequent
rapidly in-falling matter, with that in-fall resulting in the rotating disk. Non-
rotating elliptical galaxies do not form about primordial black holes, but are
formed by normal Newtonian gravitational attraction between the matter.  The
spatial in-flow into these systems then results in a non-primordial black hole(s)
forming. Globular clusters also exhibit such non-primordial black holes [6].

Eqns.(4) and (8) are only applicable to a zero vorticity flow.  More generally
vorticity is a relativistic effect (involving the speed of light  c ) and is given by

where  v R  is the absolute velocity of the matter relative to the local space; see
[3,6,11]  for  the  more  general  form  of  (8)  that  includes  vorticity  and  other
relativistic  effects.  Fig.9  shows  the  component  of  the  vorticity  field  ∇ × v
induced  by  the  rotation  of  the  earth,  while  Fig.10  shows  the  much  larger
component induced by the earth's absolute linear motion.  Eqn.(14) explains the
Lense-Thirring `frame-dragging'  effect in terms of  vorticity  in the flow field,
but makes predictions different from General Relativity because of the absolute
linear motion induced component.  These conflicting predictions will soon be
tested  by  the  Gravity  Probe  B  [14,15]  gyroscope  precession  satellite
experiment.    Vorticity  is  the  rotation  of  local  space  relative  to  more  distant
space,  and  this  rotation  is  detectable  by  observing  the  spin  direction  of  a
gyroscope  being  simply  carried  around  by  the  rotating  space,  the  direction
remaining  fixed  relative  to  the  local  space.  The  smaller  component  of  the
frame-dragging  or  vorticity  effect  caused  by  the  earths  absolute  rotation
component  of v R has  already  been  determined  from  the  laser-ranged  satellites
LAGEOS(NASA)  and  LAGEOS2(NASA-ASI)  [16]  and  the  data  implies  the
indicated  coefficient  on  the  RHS  of  (14)  to  ±10%.  However  that  experiment
cannot detect the larger component of the `frame-dragging' or vorticity induced
by  the  absolute  linear  motion  component  of  the  earth  as  that  effect  is  not
cumulative, while the rotation induced component is cumulative.  The predicted
GP-B gyroscope spin precessions caused by the earth’s absolute linear motion
are shown in Fig.11.

Both (4) and (8) have wavelike aspects to their time-dependent solutions, with
the  time-dependence  being  the  rule  rather  than  the  exception  [2,3,7,12].  Such
wave  behaviour  has  been  detected  in  most  absolute  motion  experiments,  as
seen  in  the  DeWitte  data  in  Fig.5.  For  (4)  these  waves  do  not  produce  a
gravitational  force  effect  via  (5),  as  seen  by  noting  that  (4)  gives  the  same  g
field as (3). But with the inclusion of the `dark matter’ spatial dynamics in (8)
such  waves  do  produce  a  gravitational  force  effect,  and  there  are  various
experimental  `anomalies’which  are  probably  manifestations  of  this  effect.  As
well  such  waves  affect  the  vorticity  from  (14),  and  so,  in  principle,  could  be
detected  by  the  GP-B  experiment  [12].  General  Relativity  predicts  a  very
different  kind  of  gravitational  wave,  but  these  have  never  been  seen,  despite
extensive searches. The new theory of gravity implies that these waves do not
exist.

Here  the  1st  term  is  the  Euler  `fluid’  acceleration  in  (5),  the  2nd  term  is  the

leading  to  the  so-called  `geodesic'  effects,  such  as  the  precession  of  elliptical
orbits.  It  is  significant  that  the  time-dilation  effect  in  (15)  leads  to  the  `fluid’
acceleration  in  (4)  and  (5),  revealing  a  close  link  between  the  spatial  flow
phenomena  and  relativistic  effects.    Indeed  the  form  of  the  Euler  `fluid’
derivative in (5) and (16) is seen to be directly responsible for Newton’s inverse
square  law  of  gravity.  Reformulation  of  (15)  for  electromagnetic  waves  gives
the gravitational light bending and in particular the gravitational lensing effect
in place of (16).

General  Relativity and the Schwarzschild Metric
We  saw  that  Newtonian  gravity  eventually  failed  because  it  was  expressed  in
the limited formalism of the gravitational acceleration field  g .  As  soon  as  we
introduce  the  velocity  field  formalism  together  with  its  `dark  matter'
generalisation we see that numerous gravitational anomalies are explained [6].
General Relativity was constructed to agree with Newtonian gravity, and so it is
flawed  by  this  connection.    So  it  is  interesting  to  understand  why  General
Relativity (GR) is supposed to have passed key observational and experimental
tests. GR uses the Einstein tensor  Gµν  and relates it to the energy-momentum
stress  tensor  Tµν.  Then  (17)  determines  the  metric  g
xµν ( )  tensor,  where

In  this  formalism  the  trajectories  of  test  objects  are  also  determined  by
extremising  (15)  which,  after  a  general  change  of  coordinates,  gives  the

This solution is the basis of various experimental checks of General Relativity
in which the spherically symmetric mass is either the sun or the earth.  The four
tests  are:  the  gravitational  redshift,  the  bending  of  light,  the  precession  of  the
perihelion  of  Mercury,  and  the  time  delay  of  radar  signals.  However  the
solution  (19)  is  in  fact  completely  equivalent  to  the  in-flow  interpretation  of
Newtonian  gravity.    Making  the  change  of  variables,  first  discovered  by

which is exactly the differential form of (15) for the velocity field given by the
Newtonian form in (6). This result shows that the Schwarzschild metric in GR
is  completely  equivalent  to  Newton's  inverse  square  law:  GR  in  this  case  is
nothing more than Newtonian gravity in disguise.  So the so-called `tests' of GR
were  nothing  more  than  a  test  of  the  `geodesic’  equation  (15),  where  most
simply  this  is  seen  to  determine  the  motion  of  an  object  relative  to  an
observable  and  observed  absolute  local  physical  3-space.  These  tests  were
merely  confirming  the  in-flow  formalism,  and  have  nothing  to  do  with  a
Schwarzschild spacetime ontology. So the claimed `successful tests’ of GR had
nothing  to  do  with  the  conjectured  GR  Einstein  dynamics;  and  as  well
whenever  GR  was  found  to  fail,  as  for  the  spiral  galaxy  non-Keplerian
rotations,  for  example,  spurious  arguments  were  put  in  place  to  protect  the
theory,  here  by  introducing  the  concept  of  `dark  matter’  and  the  consequent
costly  but  fruitless  search  for  such  `matter’,  or  in  numerous  other  cases  the
experimental results were suppressed.

Since GR has only been directly tested using the metric in (19) or equivalently
(21), it is interesting to ask what is the particular form that (17) then takes.  To
that end we substitute into (17) a special class of flow-metrics – the Panlevé-
Gullstrand metric, involving an arbitrary time-dependent velocity flow-field,

This simply corresponds to the fact that GR does not permit the `dark matter'
effect,  and  this  happens  because  GR  was  forced  to  agree  with  Newtonian
gravity,  in  the  appropriate  limits,  and  that  theory  also  has  no  such  effect.  As
well  in  GR  the  energy-momentum  tensor  Tµυis  not  permitted  to  make  any
reference  to  absolute  linear  motion  of  the  matter;  only  the  relative  motion  of
matter  or  absolute  rotational  motion  is  permitted,  again  another  legacy  of  the
erroneous  Einstein  postulates.  It  is  very  significant  to  note  that  the  above
exposition of the GR formalism for the metrics in (22) is exact. Taking the trace
of  G ij   in  (24)  we  obtain  using  (10),  also  exactly,  and  in  the  case  of  zero
vorticity and outside of matter, that
∂
∂t
which  is  exactly  the  `velocity  field′  formulation  in  (4)  of  Newtonian  gravity
outside  of  matter.      This  should  have  been  expected  as  it  corresponds  to  the
previous  observation  that  the  `Newtonian  in-flow'  velocity  field  is  exactly
equivalent  to  the  external  Schwarzschild  metric.    There  is  in  fact  only  one
indirect confirmation of the GR formalism apart from the misleading external
Schwarzschild  metric  cases,  namely  the  observed  decay  of  the  binary  pulsar
orbital  motions,  for  only  in  this  case  is  the  metric  non-Schwarzschild, and so
not equivalent to the `inverse square law’. However the new theory of gravity
also leads to the decay of orbits, and on the grounds of dimensional analysis we
would expect comparable predictions.  It is also usually argued that the Global
Positioning  System  (GPS)  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  General  Relativity.
However  as  shown  in  [13]  the  new  spatial-flow  formalism  of  gravity  also
explains  this  system,  and  indeed  gives  a  physical  insight  into  the  processes
involved. In particular the relativistic speed and `gravitational red-shift’ effects
now acquire a unified explanation.

Discussion
The experimental evidence from at least seven observations of absolute linear
motion,  some  using  2nd order  ( / )
v c 2   Michelson  interferometers  and  some  1st
order  v c/
 coaxial cable experiments, all showed that absolute linear motion is
detectable,  and  indeed  has  been  so  ever  since  the  1887  Michelson-Morley
experiment.  Even Michelson and Morley reported a speed of 8km/s using the
Newtonian theory for the instrument, but which becomes ≥ v p  = 300 km/s when
the  Fitzgerald-Lorentz  dynamical  contraction  effect  and  the  refractive  index
effect  are  both  taken  into  account. It then follows that vacuum interferometer
experiments will fail to detect that absolute motion, as is the case. Reports from
such  `dud’  experiments  are  always  eagerly  published  by  mainstream  physics
journals,  as  yet  another  confirmation  of  the  Einstein  postulates,  but  which
merely promote even further ongoing confusion.  These experiments are merely

12

testing the Lorentz contraction effect, and so far no violations have been seen.
We  also  understand  that  the  various  relativistic  effects  are  caused  by  the
absolute  motion  of  systems  through  space,  an  idea  that  goes  back  to  Lorentz.
Elsewhere  [2,3,7]  we  have  shown  that  both  the  Galilean  and  Lorentz
transformations have a role in describing mappings of data between observers
in relative motion, but that they apply to different forms of the data. So absolute
motion is a necessary part of the explanation of relativistic effects, and indeed
the Lorentz transformation and symmetry are consistent with absolute motion,
contrary  to  current  beliefs  within  physics.  On  the  contrary  the  Einstein
postulates and their apparent link to these relativistic effects have always been
understood to imply that absolute motion is incompatible with these relativistic
effects.  It was then always erroneously argued that the various observations of
absolute  motion  over  more  than  100  years  must  have  been  flawed,  since  the
relativistic effects had been well confirmed in numerous experiments.

So  the  Einstein  postulates  have  had  an  enormously  negative  influence  on  the
development  of  physics,  and  it  could  be  argued  that  they  have  resulted
essentially in a 100-year period of stagnation of physics, despite many exciting
and  valid  developments,  but  even  these  will  require  a  review  of  their  deeper
foundations,  particularly  in  the  cases  of  Electromagnetism,  Relativistic
Quantum Field Theory and Cosmology.

A major effect of the Einstein postulates was the development of a relativistic
theory of gravity that was constrained to agree with Newtonian gravity in the
non-relativistic limit. But indications that Newtonian gravity was flawed have
been  growing  for  over  50  years,  as  evidenced  by  the  numerous  so-called
`gravitational  anomalies',  namely  observations  of  gravitational  effects
incompatible  with  Newtonian  gravity.  The  most  well  known  of  these  is  the
`dark  matter'  effect,  namely  that  spiral  galaxies  appear  to  require  at  least  10x
the observed matter content in order to explain the high rotation speeds of stars
and gas clouds in the outer regions.   We now see that this effect is not caused
by  any  form  of  matter,  but  rather  by  a  non-relativistic  but  non-Newtonian
aspect to gravity.  As well the Greenland bore hole g anomaly data has revealed
that  the  dimensionless  constant  that  determines  the  magnitude  of  this  spatial
self-interaction  dynamics  is  non  other  than  the  fine  structure  constant.  The
detection  of  absolute  motion  implies  that  space  has  some  structure,  for  it  is
motion through that structure which is known as `absolute motion', and which
causes  relativistic  effects.    The  phenomena  of  gravity  are  described  by  two
gravitational constant,  G  and α, and it is the small size of α that determines the
asymptotic form of the orbital rotation speeds in spiral galaxies. As well it is α
that  determines  the  magnitude  of  the  black  hole  masses  at  the  centres  of
globular  clusters,  and  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope  data  from  M15  and  G1
confirms that  M
/ 2 , where  M BH  is the black hole mass, and  M GC  is
the total mass of the globular cluster, in agreement with (8), see [6]. These are
minimal black holes where the in-flow, mandated by the matter in the globular
cluster, has a singularity. There the space is effectively destroyed.  On the other

=α

13

hand  primordial  black  holes  are  not  mandated  by  matter,  and  are  residual
phenomena from the big bang.  These primordial black holes form the kernels
of  spiral  galaxies,  and  explain  why  these  galaxies  formed  so  quickly  in  the
history  of  the  universe.        The  properties  of  black  holes  in  the  new  theory  of
gravity  are  determined  by  the  value  of  α,  and  not  by  G ,  which  determines
solely  the  interaction  between  matter  and  space.    As  well  the  new  gravity
theory  has  rotating  black  hole  solutions,  which  supersede  the  Kerr-metric
rotating  black  holes  of  GR.    It  needs  to  be  emphasised  that  (8)  is  a  classical
equation for a velocity field, with the fine structure constant  α appearing as a
fundamental dimensionless constant playing now a critical role in spatial self-
interaction  dynamics.  Nevertheless  it  suggests  that  the  spatial  dynamics  is
quantum  dynamical  at  a  deep  level,  and  that  the  effects  of  that  quantum
dynamics  manifests  at  a  much  more  accessible  scale  than  previously  thought,
where such quantum gravity effects were previously speculated to occur at the
Planck length, time and mass scales.

The detection of absolute motion and the failure of Newtonian gravity together
imply  that  General  Relativity  is  not  a  valid  theory  of  gravity;  and  that  it  is
necessary  to  develop  a  new  theory.    This  has  now  been  achieved,  and  the
essential  task  of  checking  that  theory  against  experiment  and  observation  has
now explained all the known effects that GR was supposed to have explained,
but most significantly, has also explained the numerous `anomalies' where GR
was in manifest disagreement with the experimental or observational data.   In
particular  a  component  of  the  flow  past  the  earth  towards  the  sun  has  been
extracted from the analysis of the yearly variations of the Miller data [2,3,4].

The  putative  successes  of  the  Einstein  postulates  lead  to  the  Minkowski-
Einstein  spacetime  ontology  that  has  dominated  the  mindset  of  physicists  for
100  years.  Spacetime  was  mandated  by  the  misunderstanding  that  absolute
motion  had  not  been  observed,  and  indeed  that  it  was  incompatible  with  the
established relativistic effects. Of course it was always possible to have chosen
one  foliation  of  the  spacetime  construct  as  the  actual  one  separating  the
geometrical model of time from the geometrical model of space, but that never
happened, and that possibility became one of the banned concepts of physics.

We  are  now  in  the  position  of  understanding  that  space  is  a  different
phenomenon from time, that they are not fused into some spacetime amalgam,
and that the spacetime ontolgy has been one of the greatest blunders in physics.
This  must  not  be  misunderstood  to  imply  that  the  numerous  uses  of  a
mathematical spacetime, particularly in Quantum Field Theory, were invalid.
There  the  mathematical  spacetime  formalism  encodes  dynamical  effects  of
absolute  motion.  What  is  invalid  is  the  assertion  that  such  a  mathematical
spacetime is a physical entity.

We may now ask, for the first time in essentially 100 years, about the nature of
space. It apparently has `structure' as evidenced by the fact that motion through

14

it is detectable by various experimental techniques, and that its self-interaction
is determined in part by the fine structure constant. As argued elsewhere [2,3,7]
one interpretation is that space is a quantum system undergoing classicalisation,
and at a deep substratum level has the characteristics of a quantum foam; such
an ongoing `quantum collapse’ would explain why the gravitational field  g   is
instantaneous  from  (5)  and  (8).    This  quantum  foam  is  in  differential  motion,
and  the  inhomogeneities  and  time  dependencies  of  this  motion  cause
accelerations  which  we  know  of  as  gravity.  This  motion  is  not  motion  of
something  through  a  geometrical  space,  but  an  ongoing  restructuring  of  that
quantum  foam.  One  theory  for  this  quantum  foam  arises  in  an  information-
theoretic  formulation  of  reality  known  as  Process  Physics,  in  which  all  of
reality is relational or internal information, so that in particular space itself is an
information pattern, and one implication there is that the quantum-foam system
undergoes exponential growth in a process of self-organisation, once the size of
the quantum-foam system dominates over the matter part of the universe. This
effect  then  appears  to  explain  what  is  known  as  the  `dark  energy'  effect,
although of course it is not an energy at all, just as `dark matter’ is not a form of
matter.  As well within this Process  Physics we see a possible explanation for
quantum matter, namely as informational topological defects embedded in the
spatial quantum foam.  That gives the first insights into an explanation for the
necessity of quantum behaviour and also  classicalisation. This first unification
of matter and space also gives an insight into the origin of inertia, namely that
matter  effectively  propagates  through  space  at  a  constant  velocity,  unless
subject to an applied force [2,3].

Another  curious  aspect  to  the  ongoing  confusion  in  physics  about  the
fundamental  meaning  of  motion  is  the  spurious  claim  by  Einstein  and  others
that absolute rotational motion is meaningful, but that absolute linear motion is
not,  despite  the  fact  that  the  latter  is  indistinguishable  from  the  former  in  the
limit  of  large  radius  orbits  by  matter.  The  problem  here  is  fundamental  and
critical to our whole comprehension of reality. What determines whether matter
is  in  motion  or  not?    What  is  the  inherent  meaning  of  motion?  Einstein  of
course considered at one stage that this could be explained by Mach’s Principle,
namely that absolute rotation effects were caused by rotation relative to distant
matter in the universe.  This whole debate goes back to Galileo’s postulate that
the earth rotated `absolutely’ about its own axis, as well as `absolutely’ about
the sun. In his time this postulate was fiercely debated, and indeed he did not
have any experimental or observational proof, though it clearly had simplicity.
It  was  only  in  1851  that  Foucault,  using  his  famous  precessing  pendulum
experiment,  finally  demonstrated  the  absolute  rotation  of  the  earth  about  its
own axis.  But that discovery still left a real explanation missing.   Of course it
was  Miller  who  finally  clinched  all  the  experimental  evidence  for  this
fundamental problem, although Michelson and Morley could and should have
done so. Miller detected in 1925/26 the daily rotation of the earth about its own
axis,  as  shown  in  Fig.4,  and  as  well  the  rotation  of  the  earth  about  the  sun
(using that effect to calibrate the interferometer instrument), and also the linear

15

motion of the solar system (in a direction almost perpendicular to the plane of
the ecliptic, which raises some interesting dynamical explanations for this). As
well  a  recent  reanalysis  of  his  data,  possible  now  that  we  have  a  relativistic
theory  for  the  operation  of  the  interferometer  that  also  takes  account  of  the
effects of the gas through which the light passes, has revealed a spatial in-flow
past the earth towards the sun, as well as wave effects. We now understand, for
the  first  time  since  Galileo’s  original  propositions,  the  intrinsic  meaning  of
motion;  it  is  motion  relative  to  the  substructure  of  space,  that  space  is  a
complex processing dynamical system, apparently a quantum-like information
system, with the informational `patterns’ in differential motion.

This  quantum-foam  spatial  system  invites  comparison  with  the  much  older
concept of the ‘aether', but it differs in that the aether was usually considered to
be  some  form  of  matter  residing  within  a  geometrical  space,  which  is  not  the
case  here  with  the  quantum  foam  theory  of  space;  for  here  the  geometrical
description  of  space  is  merely  a  coarse  grained  description.    Nevertheless  it
would be uncharitable not to acknowledge that the quantum-foam system is a
modern  version  and  indeed  a  return  to  the  aether  concept,  albeit  a  banned
concept.

Physics is a science. This means that it must be based on (i) experiments that
test  its  theories,  and  (ii)  that  its  theories  and  reports  of  the  analyses  of
experimental  outcomes  must  be  freely  reported  to  the  physics  community.
Regrettably,  and  much  to  its  detriment,  this  has  ceased  to  be  the  case  for
physics. Physics  has  been  in  an  era  of  extreme  censorship  for  a  considerable
time; Miller was attacked for his major discovery of absolute linear motion in
the 1920's, while DeWitte was never permitted to report to physicists the data
from  his  beautiful  1991  coaxial  cable  experiment.    Amazingly  these
experimenters  were  unknown  to  each  other,  yet  their  data  was  is  in  perfect
agreement,  for  by  different  techniques  they  were  detecting  the  same
phenomenon, namely the absolute linear motion of the earth through space. All
discussions of the experimental detections of absolute motion over the last 100
years  are  now  banned  from  the  mainstream  physics  publications.  But  using
modern  vacuum  resonant  cavity  interferometer  technology,  and  with  a  gas
placed  in  the  cavities,  these  devices  could  be  used  to  perform  superb  high-
precision  experimental  detections  of  absolute  motion,  and  at  least  one  such
experiment  is  planned.    As  well  the  Miller  and  DeWitte  data  shows  the
presence of a wave phenomenon different to the waves argued to arise within
GR theory, but which have not been detected, despite enormous costly efforts.
It  is  now  time  to  separate  the  genuine  relativistic  effects  and  their  numerous
manifestations  from  the  flawed  Einstein  postulates,  and  to  finally  realise  that
they  are  caused  by  absolute  motion  of  systems  through  a  complex  quantum
system,  which  we  know  of  as  space.  As  for  General  Relativity  it  turns  out  to
have  been  a  major  blunder.  Nevertheless  there  is  much  evidence  that  a  new
theory of gravity has emerged, and this is to be exposed to critical analysis, and
experimental and observational study. However the new theory of gravity has

16

not yet been extended to a cosmologically compact growing closed space; such
a space is implied by the deeper Process Physics.

The experimental evidence is, and that evidence dates from 1887, that the speed
of light  c  is the speed relative to a physically existing space.  When measuring
the  speed  of  light  an  observer  must  take  account  of  the  effects  of  absolute
motion on his measuring rod and clock otherwise, spuriously, the speed of light
will appear to such an observer to be  c , see [2,3].  The spacetime ontology is
based  on  not  understanding  these  real  physical  effects,  despite  Lorentz  and
others  proposing  them  in  the  19th  century.    Indeed  the  introduction  of  the
spacetime construct is reminiscent of Ptolemy’s epicycles; there the artefact of
epicycles was finally abandoned when it was realised that they were spurious
effects  from  not  taking  account  of  the  fact  that  the  observer  was  taking
observations from an earth in orbit about the sun.  Observers must always strive
to  be  aware  of  any  spurious  effects  introduced  by  a  poorly  understood
measurement procedure, otherwise that spurious effect gets misinterpreted as a
fundamental aspect of reality, as happened for both Ptolemy and Einstein.

time. Plots cross the local meridian at approximately 5hr and 17hr. The monthly changes arise from
the orbital motion of the earth about the sun.  Miller used that effect to determine the value of k in
(2), and which is now in agreement with the refractive index theory for the value of  k , see [2,3,4].

showing that at approximately 5hr and 17hr the effect is largest.  This remarkable agreement with
the Miller interferometer experiment shows that the detection of absolute motion is one of the great
suppressed discoveries in physics. At least six other interferometer or coaxial cable experiments are
consistent with this observation [2-4].

predicted by the Newtonian theory. According to (8) this difference only manifests within the earth,
see [6], and so permits the value of  α to be determined. The data shows that α is the fine structure
constant,  to  within  experimental  error.    This  small  value  for  α  explains  why  the  spiral  galaxy
rotation speed plots are so flat, and also explains the observed black holes masses at the centre of
globular clusters.

Fig.8 Data shows the non-Keplerian rotation-speed curve for the spiral galaxy NGC3198 in km/s
plotted  against  radius  in  kpc/h.  Lower  curve  is  the  rotation  curve  from  the  Newtonian  theory  or
from General Relativity for an exponential disk, which decreases asymptotically like  1/
r . This
discrepancy  is  the  origin  of  the  `dark  matter’  story.  The  upper  curve  shows  the  asymptotic form
from (13), with the decrease determined by the small value of α.  This asymptotic form is caused
by the primordial black holes at the centres of spiral galaxies, and which play a critical role in their
formation. The spiral structure is caused by the rapid in-fall to these primordial black holes.

Fig.9 Shows the smaller component of the vorticity generated by the rotation of the earth, known as
the Lense-Thirring effect. This has the form of a dipole field. In General Relativity only the earth-
rotation induced vorticity is permitted, where it is known as a gravitomagnetic effect. Vorticity is a
local rotation of space relative to more distant space. This rotation can be detected by observing the
precession of a gyroscope, whose spin direction S remains fixed in the local space.  VE is the vernal
equinox. The Gravity Probe B satellite experiment [14,15] is designed to detect these precessions.

Fig.10 Shows the earth with absolute linear velocity V in the direction discovered by Miller [5] in
1925/26. This motion causes the vorticity field component shown by the vector field lines. A much
smaller  vorticity  is  generated  by  the  rotation  of  the  earth.  Vorticity  is  a  local  rotation  of  space
relative  to  more  distant  space.  This  rotation  can  be  detected  by  observing  the  precession  of  a
gyroscope, whose spin direction S remains fixed in the local space.  VE is the vernal equinox. The
Gravity Probe B satellite experiment [14,15] is designed to detect these precessions.

Fig.11 Shows predicted spin precession angle for the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment over one
orbit, with the orbit shown in Fig.10, caused by the vorticity field arising from the absolute linear
motion of the earth [11,12].  Plots are for four different months. This particular precession is not
cumulative, compared to the precession from the earth-rotation induced vorticity component. The
GP-B experiment is optimised to detect this smaller cumulative spin precession. General Relativity
has earth-rotation induced vorticity but not the absolute linear motion induced vorticity.

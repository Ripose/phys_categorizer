A NEW ANALYSIS OF GRAVITATION AND THE PLANCK LENGTH

Roger Ellman

Abstract

The mass equivalency m·c2 = h·f applies to gravitational mass just as to inertial
mass.    From  that,  the  gravitational  mass  has  a  corresponding,  associated,  equivalent
frequency, f.  Using that frequency a new result is obtained in which the significance of
the Planck Length, lPl, is clarified.  The Planck Length is fundamental to gravitation and
in  effect  supercedes  G  in  that  role  because  it  is  found  that  there  is  operational  or
mechanical  significance  to  the  role  of  the  Planck  Length  in  gravitation  whereas  G  is
simply a constant of proportionality.

It further is shown that the Planck Length [and, likely the  Planck mass  and  the
Planck time] are slightly mis-defined by the use of h-bar [ h/2π ] rather than simply
Planck's constant, h.

In addition, the applicability of using the frequency aspect of mass in the analysis
of  gravitation,  and  the  nature  of  the  results  obtained,  would  appear  to  imply  a
considerably greater significance for the frequency aspect of mass, matter and particles in
general than has been heretofore recognized.

A NEW ANALYSIS OF GRAVITATION AND THE PLANCK LENGTH

Roger Ellman

Newton's law of gravitation expressed in terms of msource and macted-on and

with both sides of the equation divided by ma is, of course,
(1)              ms
       agrav = G·
                 d2

which states that gravitation is proportional to the mass  of the  gravitationally  attracting
body; it is a property of that body's mass.

However,  mass  and  energy  are  equivalent,  so that  mass,  m,  is  proportional  to  a

frequency, f, that is characteristic of that mass.  That is
(2)    m·c2 = h·f
              c2
          f =  · m
               h
so that the source mass of equation (1), ms, has a corresponding, associated, equivalent
frequency, fs.

That  being  the  case,  the  amount  of  gravitational  acceleration,  agrav,  can  be
expressed in terms of that frequency as the change, ∆v, in the velocity, v, of the attracted
mass  per  time  period,  Ts,  of  the  oscillation  at  the  corresponding  frequency,  fs,  as
follows.
(3)    agrav = ∆v/Ts

 = ∆v·fs

It can then be reasoned as follows.

(4)                      ms
       agrav = ∆v·fs = G·  [Equating agrav of (1) and (3)]
                         d2

 = G·     mass and fp and mp are the
       d2     proton frequency and mass:

(5)          ms            ms    [Frequency is proportional to
       ∆v·  ·fp
             
mp     
                                fs = (ms/mp)·fp.]
                 mp
       ∆v = G·             [Rearrange, canceling ms's.]  
              d2·fp
Then:

(6)              1    h·fp
       ∆v = G·  ·      [Substituting mp = h·fp/c2]
               d2·fp   c2

                 h
       ∆v = G· 
               d2·c2

Now, the Planck Length, lPl, is defined as

         [the h/2π part being h-bar]

(7)          h·G  ½
      lPl ≡   
             2π·c3
so that
2
(8)        2π·c3·lPl
      G =  
              h

Substituting G as a function of the Planck Length from equation (8) into G as in

equation (6), the following is obtained.
2
(9)          2π·c3·lPl
       ∆v =   · 
                h       d2·c2

    h

2
             2π·c·lPl
       ∆v =              [Simplifying]
                d2

2
       ∆v    2π·lPl
         =              [Rearranging]
        c      d2

This result states that:

the velocity change due to gravitation, ∆v,

! 
!  per cycle of the source mass's equivalent frequency, fs,

–  which quantity is the gravitational acceleration, agrav,

!  expressed as a fraction of the speed of light, c,
! 

is proportional to the squared ratio of
the Planck Length, lPl, to
the source to acted-on separation distance of the masses, d.

– 
– 

That squared ratio is, of course, the usual inverse square behavior.
                                           

This  result  also  means  that  at  distance  d  =  √2π·lPl  from  the  center  of  the
source,  attracting,  mass  the  acceleration  per  cycle  of  that  attracting  mass's  equivalent
frequency, fs, namely ∆v, is equal to the full speed of light, c, the most that it is possible
for  it  to  be.    In  other  words,  at  that  [quite  close]  distance  from  the  source  mass  the
maximum  possible  gravitational  acceleration  occurs.    That  is  the  significance,  the
physical meaning, of lPl or, rather, of [2π]½·lPl.

If the original definition of lPl had been in terms of h, not h-bar = h/2π  the
distinction  with regard to  [2π]½  would  not  now  be  necessary.   The  2π  is  a  gratuitous
addition, coming about from the failure to address the Hydrogen atom's stable orbits as
being  defined  by  the  orbital  path  length  being  an  exact  multiple  of  the  orbital  matter
wavelength.  The statement that the orbital electron's angular momentum is quantized, as
in
                    h
         m·v·R = n·               [n = 1, 2, …]
                   2π
is merely a mis-arrangement of
                   h
         2π·R = n· = n·λ
                  m·v

the  statement  that  the  orbital  path,  2π·R,  must  be  an  integral  number  of  matter
wavelengths,  λ
mw , long,  n being  an  integer that  takes  the  values  1,  2,  …  .    And, that
may  have  resulted from  a  lack  of confidence  in  the  fundamental  significance  of  matter
waves  because  of  the  failure  to  develop  theory  that  produced  acceptable,  valid,  matter
wave  frequencies,  ones  such  that  fmw·λmw  =  particle  velocity,  which  is  an
obvious necessity.]

The  physical  significance  of  lPl  is  in  its  setting  of  a  limit  on  the  minimum
separation  distance  in  gravitational  interactions  and  its  implying  that  a  "core"  of  that
radius is at the center of fundamental particles having rest mass.  That is, equation (9)
clearly implies that it is not possible for a particle having rest mass to approach another
such  particle  closer  than  that  distance.    It  is  as  if  that  distance  is  the  radius  of  some
impenetrable core of particles having rest mass.

That physical significance of lPl or, rather, of [2π]½·lPl, is so fundamental that
it  truly  represents  a  fundamental  constant:    fundamental  to  gravitation  and  apparently
fundamental  to  particle  structure.    For  those  reasons  that  distance  should  be  deemed  a
new fundamental constant of nature, δ, as follows.
(10)   The fundamental distance constant δ.

         δ2 ≡ 2π·lPl
         δ = 4.05084 × 10-35 meters     [1986 CODATA Bulletin]

Equation (9), above, then becomes equation (11), below,

(11)   ∆v    δ2
         =  
        c     d2

a  quite  pure,  precise  and  direct  statement  of  the  operation  of  gravitation.    It  states  that
gravitation is a function of the speed of light, c, and the inverse square law, in the context
of  the  oscillation  frequency,  fs,  corresponding  to  the  attracting  body's  mass.    It  is
interesting  to  note  that  equation  (11)  is  exact  without  involving  a  constant  of
proportionality such as G.

There is an implication, then, that gravitation and the gravitational field involve
something  oscillatory  in  nature,  traveling  or  propagating  at  c  while  oscillating  at  fs.
Essentially  the  same  description  can  be  made  of  light  and  of  all  electro-magnetic
radiation.    It  would  seem  somewhat  absurd  for  material  reality  to  involve  two  such
propagations.    Rather,  there  must  be  one  simple  such  form  underlying  both  effects,
gravitational and electro-magnetic.

Abstract-  The  light  propagation  through  one-dimensional  photonic  crystal  using  Four-wave  mixing  (FWM) 
nonlinear  process  is  modeled.  The  linear  and  nonlinear  indexes  of  refraction  are  approximated  with  the  first 
Fourier harmonic term. Based on this approximation, a complete set of coupled wave equations, including pump 
fields depletion, for description of FWM process and conversion efficiency from pump to signal and idler waves 
for  periodic  structures  is  presented.  The  derived  coupled  wave  equations  are  evaluated  numerically.  Some  of 
important system parameters effects on FWM performance are investigated. The obtained relations are suitable 
and  can  easily  be  applied  for  description  of  Wavelength  Division  Multiplexing  (WDM)  optical  signals 
)3(χ (parametric  process)  nonlinear  fiber  Bragg  Gratings  compatible  to  optical  fiber 

transmitted  through 
communications.  
 
Key  words-  FWM Process, Photonic Crystal, Conversion Efficiency, Parametric down conversion, Correlated

I.  Introduction-  Nonlinear  phenomenon  in  optical  range  plays  critical  role  in  all-optical  networks. 
For example, Kerr-like nonlinear medium is very interesting for realization of full-optical devices and 
systems,  such  as  optical  limiter,  optical  switch,  optical  A/D  and  D/A,  optical  Multiplex  and  De-
multiplex,  and  many  other  interesting  applications  [1].  As  a  second  category  of  application, 
generation  of  entangled  photon  pairs  has  been  considered  as  an  important  topic,  because  of  its  key 
role  in  realizing  quantum  communication  technology,  including  quantum  cryptography,  quantum 
dense coding, and quantum teleportation [2-4]. Anther important application is wave mixing in optical 
range [5, 6].  
All  of  these  advantages  and  other  nonlinear  medium  based  applications  are  so  interesting  from 
practical point of view, especially for obtaining all-optical communication network.  
One of nonlinear important phenomenon is Four-wave Mixing (FWM) process. FWM has long been 
studied especially in the optical fibers and in investigation of the wavelength and dense wavelength 
division  multiplexing  (WDM  and  DWDM)  systems.  FWM  is  really  a  photon-photon  scattering 
process, during which two photons from a relatively high-intensity beam, called pump beam, scatter 
)3(χ ) nonlinearity of a material to generate two correlated photons, called signal 
through third-order (
and idler photons respectively [7-9].  
In  homogeneous  nonlinear  media  (such  as  bulk  material),  efficient  exchange  of  energy  between 
interacting  modes  of  the  electromagnetic  field  is  determined  by  the  linear  and  nonlinear 
susceptibilities  of  the  medium.  So,  successful  achievement  of  the  proposed  applications  strongly 
depends  on  the  nonlinearity  strength  and  medium  structure.  But  these  materials  suffer  from  several 
problems which some of them are mentioned below: 
)3(χ Nonlinearity is usually small compared to
1. 
2. Wavelengths of signal and idler photons are close to pump wavelengths. 
3. In the case of small conversion efficiency, even small amounts of pump beam scattering generates 
large background count rates that mask the detection of correlations between signal and idler photons. 
(on the other hand scattering of the pump fields tends to mask the desired quantum effects).  

)2(χ . 

)3(χ  nonlinear  optical  materials  can  be  eliminated  by  using 
Many  of  the  problems  associated  with 
suitable  structures  such  as  single  mode  optical  fibers.  These  optical  fibers  have  extremely  low  loss, 
small confinement cross section and can be as long as several kilometers. The nonlinearity is an off-
)3(χ  Kerr effect with an ultra fast frequency response extending from dc to well above 10 
resonance 
THz. Although weak, it can give rise to very large nonlinear effect in long fibers.  
It is obvious that the material’s permittivity determines how phase matched is a given parametric 
process, whereas the actual coupling of energy between the modes is a function of the material’s 
nonlinear polarizability. In an attempt to circumvent material constraints (second alternative), much 
works have been focused on the possibility of using periodic media to mediate nonlinear processes. 
Some of basic important works proposed the introduction of periodic structure into the linear and 
nonlinear material properties to aid in phase matching parametric interactions [10-15].  
The introduction of the periodic nonlinear modulation leads to both flexibility in phase matching and 
also makes accessible a material’s largest nonlinear coefficient. It has been shown that periodic 
modulation of a nonlinear material’s refractive index can lead to enhanced conversion efficiencies in 
parametric processes. 
Photonic crystals were first conceived by John and Yablonovitch [16,17], and have been widely used 
in all fields of optics, so especial arrangement of linear and nonlinear index of refraction can help us 
to modify the conversion efficiency of FWM process.  
In  this  paper,  we  propose  a  complete  set  of  coupled  wave  equations  describing  FWM  in  one-
dimensional  nonlinear  photonic  crystal  for  the  first  time.  The  derived  relations  include  all  system 
parameters and input status. Our consideration concentrate on 
 which is interesting for optical 
communication.  Also,  the  proposed  periodic  structure  can  be  imagined  as  nonlinear  fiber  Bragg 
Grating.  After  derivation  of  the  coupled  wave  equations  for  all  field  components  (forward  and 
reflected components), numerical methods have been used for simulation of the process. Simulation 
results for conversion efficiency are presented both for co-propagating and counter-propagating signal 
fields. Also, we try to enhance conversion efficiencies using FWM process. Our obtained results show 
that by increasing the number of the medium layers, conversion efficiency increases.  
This paper is organized as follows, 
Mathematical  formulation  and  coupled  wave  equations  are  discussed  in  section  II,  where  the 
mathematical derivation of the proposed system is presented. Simulation and numerical evaluation of 
the obtained equations is investigated in section III. Finally the paper ends with a conclusion. 
 
II. Mathematical Modeling- In this section, we try to present a mathematical model for description 
of  FWM  in  one-dimensional  nonlinear  photonic  crystal.  Typical  index  of  refraction  profiles  for  the 
considered system are illustrated in Fig. (2-1).

Eq.  (2-23)  illustrates  the  coupled  wave  equation  for  the  reflected  part  of  the  idler  field  propagating 
from left to right in the medium. 
 
We  have  solved  these  equations  numerically  and  the  effect  of  system  parameters  on  conversion 
efficiency (pump to signal and idler) is considered and illustrated in the next section. The conversion 
efficiency for forward traveling signal components can be defined as follows,

III.  Simulation  Results  and  Discussion-  In this section some of numerical simulated diagrams are 
presented for description of FWM efficiency which increases due to the periodic structure based on 
the  derived  equations  in  the  previous  section.  For  realization  of  this  subject,  we  have  simulated  the 
equations  both  for  co-propagation  and  counter-propagation  efficiencies.  Our  simulations  show  that, 
the  co-propagation  conversion  efficiency  is  considerably  larger  than  the  counter-propagation  case. 
This subject can be described based on the basic principles of energy transfer between forward and 
backward propagating modes in Bragg Gratings.  
Effect  of  number  of  periods  on  co-propagation  conversion  efficiency  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  (1). 
Conversion  efficiency  is  decreased  with  decreasing  of  the  nonlinear  index  of  refraction  coefficient. 
FWM phenomenon is strongly affected by the nonlinear index of refraction coefficient and this effect 
has been shown in our numerical simulations.  
Also,  since  the  conversion  efficiency  is  nonlinearly  dependant  on  the  number  of  periods,  it  is 
decreased when we choose much more layers than 600 layers, so it is necessary to keep in mind this 
subject in design of a photonic crystal to avoid decreasing of the conversion efficiency.

The effect of mismatching between four optical field wave vectors (two pumps, signal and idler fields) 
on  conversion  efficiency  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  (2).  by  increasing  of  phase  mismatching,  conversion 
efficiency  is  decreased.  This  is  related  to  weak  energy  transfer  between  propagating  modes  in  this 
case.

The effect of mismatching between the average wave vector of optical fields and Grating wave vector 
is  demonstrated  in  Fig.  (3).  by  increasing  of  mismatching,  conversion  efficiency  decreases  and  also 
because  of  nonlinear  relation  between  conversion  efficiency  and  number  of  periods,  as  number  of 
periods becomes larger, the difference between efficiencies in different mismatchings, becomes much 
more apparent. Also, as we know in Grating structure high efficiency is accessible with large number 
of  periods  and  this  effect  shows  that  for  obtaining  higher  efficiencies,  mismatching  must  be 
considered as small as possible.

Summary  and  Conclusion-  The  coupled  mode  equations  for  light  propagation  through  one-
dimensional  nonlinear  photonic  crystals  using  FWM  process  in  steady  state  condition  have  been 
developed. We have considered the photonic crystal as a lossless, dispersiveless and inhomogeneous 
medium.  The  linear  and  nonlinear  indexes  of  refraction  are  approximated  with  the  first  Fourier 
harmonic term.  
The  derived  equations  have  been  solved  numerically  and  the  obtained  results  show  that  conversion 
efficiency  increases  considerably  using  nonlinear  photonic  crystal.  Also,  the  effect  of  system 
parameters on conversion efficiency was illustrated. It was shown that number of periods, nonlinear 
and linear indexes of refraction and magnitude of pump fields have a deep and strong effect on system 
performance. 
Although all of fields in our work deplete through propagating in nonlinear photonic crystal, we could 
enhance  conversion  efficiency  of  FWM  process  in  these  crystals.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  the 
presented  results  are  not  the  optimum  ones,  but  they  are  only  typical  simulations  for  some  given 
parameters.

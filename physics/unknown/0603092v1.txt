Abstract:  Using  an  analytical  expression  for  an  integral  involving  Bessel  and  Legendre 

functions we succeeded to obtain the partial wave decomposition of a general optical beam 

at  an  arbitrary  location  from  the  origin.  We  also  showed  that  the  solid  angle  integration 

will  eliminate  the  radial  dependence  of  the  expansion  coefficients.  The  beam  shape 

coefficients  obtained  are  given  by  an  exact  expression  in  terms  of  single  or  double 

integrals. These integrals can be evaluated numerically in a short time scale. We presented 

the results for the case of linear polarized Gaussian beam.

Partial  wave  decomposition  of  incident  beams  is  an  important  task  for  any 

scattering  problem  of  spherical  particles  and  other  geometries.  For  the  case  of  spherical 

particles  the  origin  of  the  coordinate  must  be  in  the  center  of  the  sphere  to  impose  the 

boundary  conditions  of  continuity  of  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  at  the  interfaces. 

Therefore, the partial wave decomposition must be performed for an arbitrary origin and

not  at  any  convenient  position  of  high  symmetry  points  of  the  beam.  Although  partial 

wave  decomposition  is  used  in  many  fields,  like  in  quantum  mechanic  scattering  of 

particles, in optics it requires a full vector description of the electromagnetic fields. This 

can be a quite complicated problem, especially for highly focused laser beams, where the 

paraxial limit fails, and all sorts of approximations and tricks have been used to proceed 

forward and to obtain numerical results [1]. In principle this is an old subject included in 

text books on Electrodynamics [2] and Mathematical Physics [3], where it is common to 

express the partial wave expansion of incident optical beams in the form:

Jackson [2] where possible. The expansion coefficients

For  both  sides  to  be  mathematically  identical  a  spherical  Bessel  function  must  emerge 

from  this  solid  angle  integration. At this  point  the  text  books  fail,  as  far  as  we  know,  to 

provide  the  proof  that  the  integration  over  the  solid  angle  will  actually  generate  the 

spherical Bessel function necessary to cancel out the left hand side for an arbitrary optical

beam  and  to  obtain  a  final  radial  independent  expression  for  the  BSC.  Sometimes  it  is 

suggested to use two radii to obtain the coefficients [2], while others propose to perform 

integration over the radius to get rid of the radial function on both sides [4]. Either way, 

the  computation  of  these  coefficients  are  evaluated  numerically  by  using  quadratures, 

finite series technique or localized approximation [5-7] being very time-consuming or, in 

the last case, an approximation. 

We recently showed [8] the analytical expression for the integral:

that allowed us to provide an analytical expression for the BSC and to show that the solid 

angle  integration  will  indeed  generate  the  required  spherical  Bessel  function  for  an 

arbitrary  normal  incident  beam,  instead  of  the  traditional  employed  Barton-Davis  beam 

description  [9-10].  The  BSC  are  given  by  an  exact,  closed  expression,  without  any 

approximation, in terms of a single, for axially symmetric beams, or double integrals, for 

non axially symmetric beams. These integrals can be numerically evaluated in a short time 

scale  by  common  calculation  package  which  also  makes  it  very  helpful  for  numerical 

evaluation. 

To  keep  the  formalism  general  the  electromagnetic  fields of  an  incident  arbitrary 

beam  perpendicularly  to  a  lens  system  will  be  described  by  the  Angular  Spectrum

solution for the fields of high NA objectives are directly recovered from these expressions, 

but for decomposition purposes it is better to keep the incident beam in the integral form 

of  Eq.  (4).  To  achieve  a  general  solution  the  first  task  is  to  change  the  cylindrical

BSC are no longer independent and are related. For such a beam the BSC can be rewritten

Depending on the values of  n  and  m , the BSC would be purely real or imaginary if the 

beam is placed on the coordinate axis.

We  apply  this  formalism  to  a  Gaussian  beam  (λ=800nm  and  waist 

ω =2.5mm) 

a

overfilling an objective aperture of NA = 1.25, and focal length  f =1.7mm. By changing 

the overfilling parameter (beam waist at the objective aperture) one can go from a uniform 

illumination with diffraction to an immerging Gaussian beam after the objective. Figures 1 

and 2 shows the radial component of the ASR and the partial wave reconstructed summed 

up to 

30=n

 of the electric field for an underfilled objective, while Fig. 3 and 4 shows the 

results for an overfilled objective aperture. We used the thumb rule 

n =

ork

 to choose the 

maximum  n  value. The radial component of electric field of the plots shows how good the 

results are for different objective overfilling factors. These results were calculated with our 

code 

written 

for

 is the integral in α of Eq. (14). 

As  a  conclusion  we  developed  a  new  exact  and  numerically  efficient  method  for 

the  evaluation  of  BSC  for  incident  optical  beams  with  respect  to  an  arbitrary  origin, 

polarization  and  amplitude  in  terms  of  experimental  parameters.  The  description  is 

presented only in terms of electromagnetic fields instead of Poynting vector or Intensity, 

making  it  compatible  with  electromagnetic  vector  diffraction  problems.  We  emphasize 

that the integral (Eq. 3) was fundamental for this development that dramatically simplifies 

the BSC calculation for an arbitrary translation. We remark that no assumption has been 

made for the size of the scatterer, thus making it adequate for the most general case of the

Mie regime and readily applicable (in the case of optics). The framework of the formalism 

presented here can also be easily applied to general beams such as Laguerre beams, laser 

sheets, doughnut and top-hat beams, these types of beams will be deferred to a later study.

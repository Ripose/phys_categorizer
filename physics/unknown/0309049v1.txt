Abstract  

Introduction 

 
The  pyroelectric  crystals  are  known  to  have  an  amazing  capability  for  generating  electron 
beams,  as  their  temperature  changes  [1-8].  The  electron  beam  energy  can  attain  170  keV  [7], 
depending  on  the  type  of  crystal,  its  thickness,  heating/cooling  conditions.  The  electron  beam  can 
even be self-focused [8]. The electric fields generated by pyrocrystals can be as high as 106 V/cm 
[9]. As it has been recently demonstrated, this phenomenon can be used for creating a compact low-
power  X-ray  generator  [6,9,10].  The  basic  peculiarities  of  this  generator  are  the  absence  of  outer 
high-voltage  power  source,  safety,  small  size  [6,9,10].  Here,  we  present  some  properties  of  X-ray 
spectra from pyroelectric X-ray generator with copper and chromium foils.  

The X-ray generator 

Pyroelectric  X-ray  generator  was  created  at  Kharkov  Institute  of  Physics  and  Technology. 

 
The scheme of the generator is similar to one described in Refs. [6, 9, 10]. It is shown in Fig. 1.

Si(Li) X-ray detector, 17 - computer, 18 -  temperature-measuring device, 19-fore-vacuum pump, 20 - 
pulse-height analyzer, 21 – thermocouple. 
The  generator  uses  a  pyroelectric  crystal  LiNbO3  of  size  3.7x4.3x2.5  mm3,  which  is 
 
subjected to cyclic variations of temperature (heating/cooling) in the temperature range from - 50°C 
to + 120°C. The Z – axis of the crystal is along the axis of the generator. A vitrified wire resistor was 
used for heating, while liquid nitrogen was used for cooling. The cooling line was fabricated from 
copper rod, and its one end was closely connected with the crystal and the heater, and the other end 
was immersed in liquid nitrogen. The duration of heating was specified by the resistor current value. 
The air pressure in the chamber of the generator can be regulated with the help of a variable leak 
valve and a vacuum pump. The optimum pressure ranges was found between 10 and 50 mTorr. The 
grounded metal foil serve as a target for generation of X-rays. The spacing between the foil and the 
crystal surface can be varied from 0 to 15 mm. The X-ray spectra are measured by a semiconductor 
Si(Li) X-ray detector having a resolution of 250 eV (full width at half height). The brass base and 
cooling line and target was grounded. 

X-ray spectra  

The  crystal  surface  on  the  side  of  the  detector  should  be  charged  positively  at  heating  and 
negatively at cooling. So, at cooling, the electrons can go from the crystal to the target. The target, 
being bombarded with electrons emits the characteristic X-ray radiation and bremsstrahlung. X-ray 
radiation spectra measured at cooling with Cu and Cr targets are shown in Figs. 2,4 respectively. 
 
At heating, the crystal polarization is reversed and surface, which directed to target, should 
be charged positively. In this case, characteristic X-ray radiation and bremsstrahlung goes from the 
crystal.  This  radiation  passes  trough  a  thin  foil  and  reaches  the  detector.  At  crystal  heating,  the 
radiation spectra comprises the characteristic K-lines of both crystal and target elements (Figs. 3,5). 
A part of radiation can go from the chamber walls, as the body of the vacuum chamber is made with 
brass.  The  registered  radiation  intensity  corresponding  to  cooling  is  higher  than  the  one 
corresponding to heating.

The maximum energy of x-rays 

Experiments  were  made  to  measure  the  x-ray  spectra  at  dynamic  conditions.  During  a 

 
thermal cycle, the several spectra were measured for one minute each.  
 
Eight  spectra  were  measured  at  LiNbO3 heating from  -  50°C  up  to +125°C.  Fig.  6  shows  a 
 
typical dependence of measured maximum energy of X-rays in spectra on the temperature. In this 
experiment,  the  crystal  of  size  3.7x4.3x2.5  mm3  was  used.  It  is  seen  from  the  figure  that  as  the 
crystal was heated, the maximum energy increased up to ~28 keV (20°C), and then fell off to 17 keV 
(62°C)  with  a  further  rise  up  to  ~  30  keV  (120°C).  After  heating  was  ceased,  the  intensity  and 
maximum energy of the x-rays went to zero.

Similar  measurements  were  also  conducted  on  cooling  the  crystal.  A  typical  curve  for  the 
measured maximum energy of radiation versus crystal temperature at cooling conditions is shown in 
Fig.  7.  It  increases,  as  the  crystal  is  cooled,  and  reaches  its  maximum  of  ~38  keV  at  room 
temperature ( ~20°C), then the x-ray maximum energy drops to 0 keV (- 40°C).

Conclusion  

The pyroelectric X-ray generator was created in KIPT and its operation was demonstrated. 
Results of our first experiments are mainly in agreement with the results of earlier pioneer works  [6, 
8-10].  

Continuous part of X-ray spectra in Figs. 2-4 should be due to bremsstrahlung of accelerated 
electrons in a target and crystal. Thus, the maximum energy of X-rays should be close to maximum 
energy of these electrons. Therefore, Figs. 6,7 show values close to maximum energy of electrons in 
the generator.

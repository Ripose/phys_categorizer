Introduction

The study of transport mechanisms at the nanoscale level

is of great

importance nowadays. Specifically,

the nanoparticles and nanotubules have

important physical applications for nano- and micro-scale technologies [1]. Many

models have been developed in the simple picture of point-like particles One

possibility that has been considered in the literature is that of nonlinear Klein-

Gordon system where the on-site potential is ratchet-like .

The development of the ultra-short laser pulses opens new possibilities in the

study of the dynamics of the electrons in nanoscale systems: carbon nanotubes ,

nanoparticles. For attosecond laser pulses the duration of the pulse is shorter

than the relaxation time. In that case the transport equations contain the second

order partial derivative in time. The master equation is the Klein-Gordon equation

In this paper we consider the non - linear Klein Gordon equation for mass

and thermal energy transport in nanoscale. Considering the results of the

monograph [1] we develop the nonlinear Klein Gordon equation for heat and

mass transport

in nanoscale. For ultrashort laser pulse the nonlinear Klein-

Gordon equation is reduced to the nonlinear d`Alembert equation. In this paper

we find out the implicit solution of the nonlinear d`Alembert equation for heat

transport on nanoscale. It will be shown that for ultra-short laser pulses the non-

linear Klein-Gordon equation has the nonlinear traveling wave solution

2. Nonlinear heat and mass transfer in nanoscale

In monograph [1] it was shown that in the case of the ultra short laser

pulses the heat transport is described by the Heaviside hyperbolic heat

transport equation:

τ∂2T/∂2t + ∂T/∂t = D ∂2T/∂2x

(1)

where T denotes the temperature of the electron gas in nanoparticle,τis

the relaxation time m is the electron mass and D is the thermal diffusion

2

coefficient. The relaxation time τis defined as:

τ=h/mv2

v =αc

(2)

(3)

where v is the thermal pulse propagation speed. For electromagnetic

interaction when scatters are the relativistic electrons, τ=Thomson

relaxation time

τ=h/mc2

Both parameters τand v completely characterize the thermal energy

transport on the atomic scale and can be named as “atomic” relaxation

time and “atomic” heat velocity.

In the following, starting with the atomic τand v we describe thermal

relaxation

processes in nanoparticles which consist of N light scatters.

To that aim we use the Pauli-Heisenberg inequality [3]:

  Δr Δp>N1/3 ћ

(4)

where r denotes the radius of the nanoparticle and p is the momentum of

energy carriers.

According to formula (4) we recalculate the relaxation time τfor

nanoparticle consisting N electrons:

ћN→N ћ

τN=N τ

(5)

(6)

Formula (6) describes the scaling of the relaxation time for N fermion

systems.

With formulae (4) and (5) the heat transport equation takes the form:

3

τN∂2T/∂2t+ ∂T/∂t = ћ1/3/m ∂ 2T/∂ 2x

(7)

and for mass transport:

τN ∂2N/∂2t + ∂N/∂t =N1/3 ћ/m ∂ 2N/∂ 2x

(8)

Equation (7) is linear damped Klein-Gordon equation, and was solved for

nanotechnology systems in [1].

The nonlinearity of Eq. (8) opens new possibilities for the study of non-

stationary stable processes in molecular nanostructures .Let us consider

equation (8) in more details:

( N τ)∂2N/∂2t + ∂N/∂t =N1/3 ћ/m ∂2N/∂2x

(9)

For Δt< N τEq (9) is the nonlinear d`Alembert equation

v -2∂2N/∂2t = ∂2N/∂2x

with N dependent velocity:

v=N-1/3 αc

Equation (10) can be written in more general form:

∂2N/∂2t = ∂G(N)/∂x

where

G(N)=f(N) ∂N/∂t

The traveling wave solution of equation (12) has implicit form [5]:

λ2 N(x,t) - ∫G(N)dN=A(x+λt) +B

where A,B and λare arbitrary constants

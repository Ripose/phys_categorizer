Abstract 

____________________________________________________________________________ 

In the article the transition radiation from a relativistic charge crossing a finite radius paraboloid target 

with taking into account the pre-wave zone effect is considered. It is shown that in this case the radiation cone 

narrowing  occurs  in  contrast  with  the  transition  radiation  from  the  flat  target  if  the  detector  is  situated  at  the 

distance,  which  is  smaller  than  the  focus  distance  (the  focusing  effect)  from  the  target.  At  the  charged  particle 

passage  through  the  central  hole  in  a  paraboloid  target  the  diffraction  radiation  focusing  (DR)  occurs  too.  The 

focusing of coherent DR for the non-invasive measuring of the electron bunch length is proposed.

1. Transition radiation (TR) is widely used for an electron beam diagnostics. For instance, in 

the  experiment  [1]  for  measurements  of  the  transverse  size  of  an  electron  beam,  the  optical 

transition radiation focusing system allowed the spatial resolution to be reached at about ~ 5 

mcm. In the work [2] an electron bunch length was measured using the spectrum of coherent 

transition radiation (CTR). The alternative approach was demonstrated by the authors of work 

[3], where the CTR beam was being generated by the bunch of the length of about  ~ 1mm, 

bl

then  it  was  being  focused  by  the  complicated  optical  system  on  the  electro  optical  crystal, 

through which the linear-polarized radiation of a stable laser passed. The crystal becomes  

birefringence under the influence of electric field 

 that leads to the circularly-polarized

The bunch length

the value

–  target  for  diagnostics  leads  to  a  beam 

emittance growth in avoidable.  

The non-invasive diagnostics based 

on 

the  diffraction  radiation  use  was 

 

developed  in  the  works  [4],  [5].  We  can 

suggest  the  diagnostics  scheme,  which  is 

              Fig. 1. Scheme of experiment 

analogous to the scheme used in the experiment [3] where instead TR, the diffraction radiation 

(DR) is generated by the electron beam passing through the hole of the concave target (see Fig. 

1).  In  this  case,  firstly,  the  diagnostics  becomes  practically  non-invasive,  secondly,  DR 

focusing  by  the  target  itself  simplifies  the  experimental  equipment  (there  is  no  necessity  to 

have  a  focusing  system)  and  thirdly,  increases  the  technique  sensitivity  because  the  field 

intensity of focused radiation from the concave target exceeds the field intensity from the flat 

Actually,  as  it  was  mentioned  in  work  [6],  the  virtual  photon  field  of  ultrarelativistic 

charge  is  close  to  transverse  field  of  electromagnetic  wave  by  its  characteristics.  The  virtual 

photon field, in analogy with electromagnetic wave, bends around the screen of the finite sizes, 

that  is  the  origin  of  DR  occurrence.  So,  we  can  suppose  that  for  the  parabolic  target  the 

focusing effect in transition and diffraction radiation of ultrarelativistic particles must exist. 

In the series of works [7], [8], [9], the models for TR characteristics calculation were 

developed for the deformed targets of the finite sizes. In our paper, the approach which allows 

taking into account the influence of the finite size [10], [11], the pre-wave zone effect [12] and 

the “global” form of the deformed target (for examples, paraboloid), but not a “local” one as in 

works [7], [9] has been developed. 

Besides,  the  suggested  approach  allows  both  the  characteristic  of  TR  and  DR  to  be 

calculated. As in the cited works, the perfectly conducting target is considered.  

2. Let us consider the diffraction radiation in the pre-wave zone using the model developed in 

[13]. For the simplicity of calculations, let’s choose the geometry when the relativistic electron 

with  the  constant  velocity  v   passes  near  the  semi-infinite  plane  with  almost  zero  impact 

one.

, the DR (or TR) characteristics can be described as angular distributions from 

the point-wise source (so-called far zone), while at 

1≤R

 the “pre-wave zone effect” [12] plays 

the  important  role  in  the  cases  where  the  natural  size  of  the  luminous”  target  area,  which  is 

defined order by the size parameterγλ, should be taken into account. In this case (especially at 

1<<R

) it is more natural to describe DR (TR) characteristics as coordinate distributions, for 

example, on the detector’s surface.

     It  should  be  noticed  that  the  obtained  distribution  coincides  with  the  well-known  angular

    In  the  pre-wave  zone

).  At  the  DR 

generated in the target with the variable inclination angle (for example, in paraboloid), if the 

detector is situated in the pre-wave zone, the similar behavior of the “reflected” photons groups 

them near the paraboloid axis, that is, the radiation focusing occurs (see below). 

3. To begin, let us consider the focusing effect on the example of transition radiation for the 

perfectly reflecting target made in the form of paraboloid, along the axis of which the charged 

particle moves (to the positive direction of axis 

, see Fig. 4). Let’s consider the geometry of 

TZ

backwards transition radiation again, 

as  it  was  mentioned  above.  The 

surface of such target is described by

targets of large diameter(

In  Fig.  7,  the  dependence  of  radius 

  on  the  paraboloid  diameter  is  shown.  The  given

it  can  be  supposed  that  the  “spot”  size  of  the

range  of 

radiation  wave  length).  In  Fig.  8  three 

curves are shown, which characterize the 

radial  distribution  of 

the 

radiation 

intensity  on  the  detector  situated  at  the 

distance  L=0.5  m,  for  various  wave 

lengths. With the increasing wavelength, 

the distribution is “smoothed” and the intensity in the maximum is suppressed because with the 

increasing of wavelength the parameter  R  decreases and radius 

maxR

 (see Fig. 6 b) increases as 

a result of it. 

     In  Fig.  9,  the  dependence  of  radius  of  the  focused  spot  in  the  point 

  on  the  wave

The  developed  approach  allows  the  DR  characteristics  in  paraboloid  target  with  the  hole 

(diameter 

holed

) for the electron beam passage to be calculated. In this case the low limit in the 

integral  (8)  is

In  conclusion, 

let’s  note 

the 

following.  The  virtual  photon  field  of 

ultrarelativistic particle is reflected from 

the  deformed

and 

transformed  into  the  real  photon  beam

during the transition radiation process in accordance with the rules of ordinary optics that were 

mentioned in the work [6]. Thus, it can be expected that the use of concave targets (including 

the  spherical  ones)  for  the  generation  of  TR  and  DR  allows  obtaining  the  focused  “spot”  of 

radiation without the use of optical system. For example, for the beam parameter in experiment

and hole one of 10 mm allows the to achieve 

excess  of  average  value  of  the  coherent 

diffraction  radiation  field

  on  the 

crystal of diameter of 10 mm situated at the 

distance  of  300  mm  which  is  one  order 

higher  than  that  one  from  the  flat  target  of 

the  same  sizes.  This  characteristic  defines 

the  sensitivity  of  the  technique  proposed 

(see  the  expression  (1)).  The  use  of  the 

diffraction 

radiation  generated 

in 

the 

analogous  target  allows  to  avoid  a  deterioration  of  the  beam  parameters  after  its  passage 

through the TR target (foil).

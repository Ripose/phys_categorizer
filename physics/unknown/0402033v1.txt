Abstract 

Selective H-atom line broadening was found to be present throughout the volume (13.5 
 
cm ID x 38 cm length) of RF generated  H2O  plasmas in a GEC cell.  Notably, at low pressures 
(ca. <0.08 Torr), a significant fraction (ca. 20%) of the atomic hydrogen was ‘hot’ with energies 

greater than 40 eV with a pressure dependence, but only a weak power dependence.  The degree 

of broadening was virtually independent of the position studied within the GEC cell, similar to 
the recent finding for  He / H2  plasmas in the same GEC cell.  In contrast to the atomic hydrogen 
lines, no broadening was observed in oxygen species lines at low pressures.  Also, in ‘control’ 
Xe / H2   plasmas  run  in  the  same  cell  at  similar  pressures  and  adsorbed  power,  no  significant 
broadening  of  atomic  hydrogen,  Xe ,  or  any  other  lines  was  observed.    Stark  broadening  or 

acceleration of charged species due to high electric fields can not explain the results since (i) the 

electron  density  was  insufficient  by  orders  of  magnitude,  (ii)  the  RF  field  was  essentially 

confined to the cathode fall region in contrast to the broadening that was independent of position, 

and  (iii)  only  the  atomic  hydrogen  lines  were  broadened.    Rather,  all  of  the  data  is  consistent 

with  a  model  that  claims  specific,  predicted,  species  can  act  catalytically  through  a  resonant 

energy transfer mechanism to create ‘hot’ hydrogen atoms in plasmas.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

 

Plasma sources have been developed over decades as light sources, ionization sources for 

mass spectroscopy,  excitation sources for optical spectroscopy, and sources of ions for surface 

etching and chemistry.  But, only in the last decade has extensive spectroscopic characterization 

been conducted on “mixed gas” plasmas, and these studies revealed some surprising results for 

those  mixed  gas  plasmas  in  which  hydrogen  was  one  of  the  gases.    In  mixtures  of  argon  and 

hydrogen,  the  hydrogen  emission  lines  are  significantly  broader  than  any  argon  line.    For 

example, Kuraica and Konjevic [1-2], Videnovic et al. [3] and others [4-17] have characterized 

mixed  hydrogen-argon  plasmas  by  determining  the  excited  hydrogen  atom  energies  and 
concentrations from measurements of the line broadening of the 656.3 nm  Balmer α line.  They 
found that the  Hα lines were extremely broadened and explained the phenomenon primarily in 
terms of Doppler broadening.  They postulated that the energy required to create the ‘hot’ (>20 
eV) hydrogen was generated by the acceleration of hydrogen ions such as  H +,  H2
+ in 
the  high  fields  (e.  g.  over  10 kV / cm )  present  in  the  cathode  fall  region.  Subsequent  charge 

+, and  H3

exchange and dissociation of the field accelerated ions left ‘hot’ neutral H atoms.  

Djurovic  and  Roberts  [5]  recorded  the  spectral  and  spatial  profiles  of  Balmer  α  line 
 
emission  from  low  pressure  RF  (13.56  MHz)  discharges  in  H2 + Ar   mixtures  in  a  direction 
normal to the electric field.  The introduction of  Ar  in a pure  H2  plasma increased the number 
of fast neutral atoms as evidenced by the intensity of the broad component of a two-component 
Doppler-broadened Balmer α line profile.  Independent of cell position or direction, the average 
energy  of  a  wide  profile  component  was  23.8  eV   for  voltages  above  100  V,  and  the  average 

energy of a slow component was 0.22 eV .  The mechanism proposed by Djurovic and Roberts is 
+.  The explanation of the role of 
the production of fast H atoms from electric field accelerated  H2
Ar  in the production of a large number of excited hydrogen atoms in the  n = 3 state, as well as 
raising their energy for a given pressure and applied RF voltage, is that collisions with  Ar  in the 
+.  The fast  H2  then 
plasma sheath region enhances the production of fast  H2  from accelerated  H2
undergoes dissociation to form fast H which may then be excited locally to the  n = 3 state by a 
further collision with  Ar .  The local excitation is a requirement since the atomic lifetime of the 
hydrogen  n = 3 state is approximately 10 −8 s , and the average velocity of the hydrogen atoms is 
< 105  m/s .    Thus,  the  distance  traveled  must  be  less  that  0.001  m.    A  number  of  additional 
mechanisms  have  been  proposed  in  order  to  explain  the  excessive  Doppler  broadening  of  the 
Balmer  α  line  in  argon-hydrogen  DC  or  RF  driven  glow  discharge  plasmas  all  of  which 
ultimately depend on electric field acceleration of hydrogen positive ions.   
 
We recently reported a similar phenomenon for mixed gas plasmas containing hydrogen, 
but  no  argon:  Preferential  hydrogen  line  broadening, often extreme, was found in a number of 

2 

mixed  gas  discharge  plasmas.    Specifically,  it  has  been  reported  that  Balmer  α  lines  broader 
than  0.25  nm  were  created  in  He / H2 (10%)  as  well  as  plasmas  called  resonant  transfer  (rt)-
plasmas containing volatilized  Sr  such as  Sr / H2  and  Sr / He / H2 (10%) plasmas which formed 
at 1000 K with extremely low or no electric field [8-17].  In none of these plasmas was there any 
significant broadening of the noble gas lines.  Furthermore, hydrogen lines were not broadened 
in  a  number  of  other  mixed  gas  plasmas  including  Xe / H2 (10%),  and  Kr / H2 (10%).    These 
results show that the presence of hot hydrogen in mixed gas plasmas is not limited to  Ar / H2 .  
They also suggest, consistent with predictions [8-19], that only very special catalytic species will 
react  in  plasmas  with  hydrogen  by  a  resonant,  nonradiative  energy  transfer  mechanism  to 
generate  hot  hydrogen.    Species  such  as  He+ ,  Ar + ,  and  Sr +   meet  the  catalyst  criterion—a 
chemical  or  physical  process  with  an  enthalpy  change  equal  to  an  integer  multiple  of 
Eh = 27.2 eV   where  Eh   is  one  hartree.    Catalyst  are  identifiable  on  the  basis  of  their  known 
electron energy levels.  Conversely, species such as atoms or ions of  Kr  or  Xe  do not fulfill the 
criterion. 
Recently there have been additional studies consistent with the model that some species 
 
act  as  catalysts  (rt-plasma)  for  creating  high  energy  H  atoms  in  mixed  gas  plasmas.    For 
example, in low pressure (0.5 Torr)  He / H2 (10%) RF plasmas maintained in a GEC cell only the 
spectral lines of the H-atoms are Doppler broadened [19].  That is, there was no broadening at all 
of the  He lines.  Moreover, the hydrogen Balmer lines were broadened consistently to the same 
magnitude ~27 eV throughout the volume of the cell, and not simply in the region between the 
electrodes.    The  finding  that  the  broadening  was  found  throughout  the  volume  indicated  that 
earlier explanations for selective H-atom broadening in  Ar / H2  RF plasmas were not applicable.  
The  earlier  explanations  all  require  that  the  origins  of  the  Doppler  energy  is  acceleration  of  H 
ions in the vicinity of the electrodes, even in cases were the excess broadening was found to be 
independent of position in the inter-electrode region [5-6].   

Another  finding  in  that  study,  also  consistent  with  the  rt-plasma  model,  was  that  in 
Xe / H2 (10%)  plasmas  there  was  no  broadening  of  either  hydrogen  or  Xe   lines  outside  of  the 
electrode  region.    Thus,  it  was  argued  that  the  broadening  was  consistent  with  a  ‘chemical’ 
reaction occurring between  He+  and hydrogen species, throughout the volume of the cell.  The 
magnitude  the  broadening  was  consistent  with  the  magnitude  of  the  energies  of  the  initial  and 
subsequent catalytic reactions that may be transferred to form fast, excited-state H [14-15, 20]. 
 
The average energy of the fast H was anticipated to depend on the particular catalyst as 
well  as  the  conditions  of  the  reaction.    For  oxygen,  there  are  several  chemical  reactions  that 
fulfill the catalyst criterion; thus, a mixed plasma with oxygen species may give an average H 
energy different from that of helium mixed plasmas under the same conditions.  The bond energy 
of  the  oxygen  molecule  is  5.165  eV,  and  the  first,  second,  and  third  ionization  energies  of  an 

3 

oxygen atom are 13.61806 eV ,  35.11730 eV , and  54.9355 eV , respectively [21].  The reactions 
O2 → O + O2 +,  O2 → O + O3+ , and  2O → 2O+  provide a net enthalpy of about 2, 4, and 1 times 
Eh , respectively [21].  It was previously reported that H lines were broadened and that both the 
Lyman and the Balmer α lines were observed to be inverted in certain rt-plasmas with oxygen 
catalyst [16-17, 22-23]. 
Our  experiments  on  the  measurement  of  the  excited  hydrogen  atom  energy  in 
 
capacitively-coupled  RF  plasmas  of  H   and  catalyst  O   (both  from  decomposition  of  H2O )  or 
plasmas  comprising  hydrogen  with  noncatalyst  xenon  were  also  consistent  with  the  rt-model.  
Direct mapping of the broadening of Balmer series lines for water plasmas in a GEC cell and the 
impact of applied power and operating pressure was studied for the first time.  The results were 
once again supportive of a field-independent mechanism.  In sum, the observation of position-
independent excessive Balmer line broadening in an RF driven water-vapor plasmas is consistent 
with  a  model  that  predicts  species  such  as  oxygen  [22-23],  can  act  catalytically  in  plasma 
environments to create hot hydrogen atoms. 
 

EXPERIMENTAL 
Plasma Hardware- All plasmas were generated in a GEC-type cell [13] held at 0.5 Torr.  
 
This system, shown elsewhere [19], consisted of a large cylindrical (14 cm ID x 36 cm length) 
Pyrex chamber containing two parallel steel circular (8.25 cm diameter) plates, placed about 1 
cm apart at the center.  RF power from a RF VII, Model RF 5 13.6 MHz power supply was sent 
to  the  plates  through  8  mm  diameter  steel  feeds,  which  entered  the  chamber  through  standard 
Ultratorr  fittings,  one  on  each  end  of  the  chamber.    UHP  grade  (99.999%)  H2   and  Xe   gases 
were  metered  into  the  chamber  through  Ultratorr  fittings  at  one  end,  about  18  cm  from  the 
electrodes, using two mass flow controllers (MKS).   

Water  vapor  was  generated  by  pumping  on  a  reservoir  (about  20  cc)  of  distilled,  de-
ionized water.  The flow rate was not directly controlled, but rather a needle valve was adjusted 
to  maintain  the  desired  pressure,  as  measured  by  a  MKS  Baratron  placed  above  a  Welch  two-
stage rotary vane oil-sealed vacuum pump (Model 8920) with a rated capacity of 218 l/min.  This 
pump  was  attached  to  the  chamber  with  a  1  cm  ID  Ultratorr  fitting  at  the  end  opposite  that  at 
which gas entered.  All parts, chamber, power supply, gauges, spectrometer, etc. were grounded 
with heavy-duty Reynolds aluminum foil to improve the magnitude of the signal to noise ratio. 
 
Spectrometer-  The spectrometer system used in this study, described in detail elsewhere 
[24],  was  built  around  a  1.25  m  visible  light  instrument  from  Jobin  Yvon-Spex  with  a 
holographic ruled diffraction grating (1800 g/mm), with a nearly flat response between 300 and 
900 nm, and the slit was set at 10  µm  in all cases.  Light was collected using a light fiber bundle 
consisting of 19 fibers, each of 200  µm  diameter, and a CCD for a detector.  Light was input to 

4 

the  spectrometer  from  the  light  fiber  placed  at  position  1.)  near  the  inlet  end  of  the  chamber 
approximately 15 cm from the cathode, 2.) in a quartz insert tube 1 cm in diameter that ended 
about  1  cm  from  the  edge  of  the  electrodes,  or  3.)  near  the  pump  end  of  the  chamber 
approximately  15  cm  from  the  anode.    The  fiber  was  oriented  ‘orthogonal’  relative  to  the 
azimuthal  axis of the chamber in all cases.  It is important to note that tests with a red laser with 
the system open clearly showed that light emanating from the region between the parallel-plate 
electrodes could not have reached the ‘hooded’ fiber optic probe when it was positioned at either 
end.  Indeed, our tests showed that light no closer than 14 cm from the plate region reached the 
fiber  optic  probe  at  Positions  1  and  3.    These  readings  were  consistent  with  the  listed  9° 
acceptance angle of the probe corresponding to a 1 cm diameter ‘spot’.  Moreover, the probes 
were  oriented  such  that  the  acceptance  cone  should  ‘miss’  the  power  feeds  by  several 
centimeters. 
 
In most cases, the data used for computations (e.g. excitation temperatures) was collected 
for the same time over the same wavelength region.  Balmer series spectral lines were fit using 
three  Gaussian  curves:  one  for  the  ‘cold’  (<0.15  eV)  hydrogen,  one  for  ‘warm’  (<2  eV) 
hydrogen, and the third for ‘hot’ (>10 eV) hydrogen.  It is notable that the fittings achieved were 
excellent, producing R2>0.98 in all cases.  One reason for the excellent fits was the absence of 
any  signal  in  the  relevant  spectral  region  of  the  Balmer  α  and  β  lines  of  the  water  plasma 
(Figure  1a).    In  contrast,  there  was  ‘signal’  in  the  same  regions  for  the  Xe / H2 (10%)  plasma 
(Figure 1c). 
 

RESULTS 
A  significant  amount  of  data  was  collected  in  order  to  reliably  detect  trends  in  the  H-
 
atom  line  broadening  in  water  plasmas  as  a  function  of  plasma  operating  conditions.    Data  on 
line broadening was systematically collected for the Balmer α, β, γ, and δ lines at the three 
positions  given  in  the  Experimental  section.    Measured  values  of  H-atom  α  and  β  line 

broadening  for  water  plasmas  at  Positions  2  and  3,  at  ten  or  more  pressures,  and  at  three 
absorbed power levels (100 W, 150 W and 200 W), are presented in Tables I-VI.  The data for 
the γ and δ lines is not presented as it is considered less reliable as the intensity of these lines is 

significantly  lower.    Also,  the  trends  in  Doppler  energy  of  the  hot  hydrogen  as  a  function  of 
pressure and applied power is virtually identical to those observed from the α and β lines; thus, 

the  data  for  the  higher  energy  transitions  in  the  Balmer  series  is  regarded  as  somewhat 
redundant, and hence not essential to the arguments presented.  
Typical  peaks  and  the  best  fit  of  the  data  to  three  Gaussian  curves  corresponding  to 
 
Doppler  broadening  are  shown  in  Figure  1.    All  mechanisms  other  than  Doppler  would  not 
produce a three component line, rather only a single component line.

The  pressure  dependence  for  a  given  adsorbed power plotted in Figures 2 and 3 shows 
 
that the energy of the hot hydrogen (as well as cold and warm atomic hydrogen) is independent 
of  position.    These  same  plots  show  that  the  Doppler  energy  of  the  hot  hydrogen  is  strongly 
dependent  on  the  pressure,  dropping  sharply  above  approximately  0.1  Torr  in  all  cases.    A 
comparison between the plots also suggests a weak dependence on the absorbed energy.  In sum, 
the results reported here clearly show that there is ‘hot’ atomic hydrogen, of an apparent energy 
between 40 and 55 eV from the  Hα line (approx. 450,000 to 550,000 K) and nearly 70 eV from 
the  Hβ  line  throughout  GEC  cell  water  vapor  plasmas  generated  at  low  pressures  (ca.  <  0.08 

Torr).  No other species in these plasmas, specifically molecular hydrogen and various oxygen 
species, were found to be ‘hot’ at these low pressures. 
 
Under  all  operating  conditions  the  magnitude  of  the  broadening  at  15  cm  from  the 
electrodes was very close to the magnitude within the region between the plates.  It is notable 
that the fraction of H-atoms that are hot is somewhat impacted by position within the cell.  As 
shown  in  Figure  4,  the  fraction  of  ‘hot’  hydrogen  is  strongly  dependent  on  pressure,  and 
somewhat on adsorbed power, and is generally slightly higher between the plates than it is at the 
end of the cell, 15 cm from the electrodes. 
Simple comparisons can be made between the results of this study of  H2O  plasmas and 
 
earlier studies, performed in the same GEC cell, of  He / H2  plasmas [19].  First, it is notable that 
there is no overlap in the Doppler energies of the hot hydrogen measured for the two different 
plasmas, despite the fact that the physical arrangement of the cell (e.g. electrode separation) was 
virtually identical in both cases.  For the water plasma the average broadening is always at least 
10 eV greater than that found in the  He / H2  plasma.  Also, one feature similar to that found with 
the  He / H2  plasma, is that the hydrogen concentration is asymmetric.  For example, for the water 
plasmas it was consistently about twice as high at the ‘pump end’ (Position 3) as it is at the inlet 
end (Position 1).  Although an exhaustive study of hydrogen lines was not made at Position 1, 
due to the low intensity of H-atom emission at that position, a limited number of comparisons 
were  made,  and  it  was  clear  that  the  magnitude  of  the  line  broadening,  the  average  excitation, 
and other features were very nearly identical at both ends of the cell.  Another difference: most 
(ca. 80%) of the atomic hydrogen was ‘hot’ in the  He / H2  plasma; whereas, less than half of the 
atomic hydrogen was found to be hot in the water plasma.  
The  intensities  of  all  four  Balmer  lines  were  used  to  obtain  a  measure  of  the  average 
 
hydrogen excitation temperature at Positions 2 and 3 as given in Figure 5 and Table VII.  The 
excitation temperature was found to be around 0.5  ±  0.1 eV (approx. 5000  ±  1000 K) for all of 
the plasmas.  This temperature was independent of the source of the different Balmer lines used 
in the computation within the error range: relative intensities of the cold, hot, or total hydrogen 
components  of  the  Balmer  lines.    These  values  are  also  similar  to  electron  temperatures 

6 

measured in earlier studies of low pressure  Ar  plasmas generated at slightly lower powers in a 
large glass cavity [25]. 
To test the catalyst mechanism, a control plasma,  Xe / H2 , was studied in some detail in 
 
this  same  GEC  cell.    Just  as  in  the  earlier  studies  with  He / H2   plasmas  [19],  these  plasmas 
produced only narrow Balmer series lines (<2.5 eV) away from the electrodes and some ‘warm’ 
hydrogen (<3 eV) between the electrodes as shown in Figure 1C.  In the earlier study [19], the 
‘control’ plasma was run at pressures similar to those of the  He / H2  plasma studied, about 0.5 
Torr.    For  this  study,  the  control  plasmas  were  studied  at  pressures  close  to  those  at  which 
selective hydrogen broadening in a water plasma was observed (<0.9 Torr).  The Balmer series 
line intensities in  Xe / H2  plasmas were very low even though the data collection times were four 
times greater than those for the water plasmas at matched pressures.  Thus, it was necessary to 
run nearly pure  H2  to get sufficient signal at the low pressures employed in the present work. 
 

DISCUSSION 
In mixed gas plasmas containing argon and hydrogen, selective line broadening of atomic 
 
hydrogen lines (no broadening of lines belonging to argon or molecular hydrogen) in high field 
regions  [1-7,  26-28]  has  been  reported  repeatedly.    Even  in  pure  hydrogen  plasmas,  generated 
with  DC  discharge  or  RF  systems,  including  one  group  using  a  GEC  cell  [7],  selective 
broadening of atomic hydrogen lines has been reported.   
All groups agree that the broadening of the lines is Doppler in origin.  Stark broadening 
 
can  be  eliminated  because  the  required  electron  densities  are  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than 
the gas densities.  Moreover, the lines are composed of three parts: hot, warm and cold.  All H 
atoms, not just a fraction, as well as other species, would be impacted by high charge densities.  
Optical thickness cannot be a factor by the same argument: the entire line would be broadened, 
not  just  a  fraction.    Computation  also  shows  that  the  optical  thickness  cannot  be  a  factor.  
Specifically, for optically thin plasmas (self adsorption not significant), the effective path length 
τω L( ) is less than one: 
 
where σω   is the absorption cross section,  NH  is the number density, and  L  is the plasma path 
length  traversed  by  the  light.    The  absorption  cross  section  for  Balmer  α  emission  is 
σ= 1 X 10 −16  cm2  [29].  An upper limit on the excited  Hα density, assuming all of the water is 
fully dissociated, the temperature (as measured) is 5000 K, and, the excited states are populated 
according  to  the  Boltzmann  distribution  (as  measured),  is  10 3
 cm −3 .    No  more  than  15  cm  of 
plasma  is  traversed.    Putting  these  values  together  yields  a  effective  path  length  of  the  order 
10 −12
 cm .    Clearly,  these  plasmas  are  optically  thin.    Other  potential  explanations  such  as 
instrument broadening can be readily eliminated because those mechanisms would not produce 

τω L( ) = σωN H L < 1

selective  broadening  of  one  species.    Moreover,  all  the  Balmer  series  lines  are  broadened 
approximately to the same energy level, a result completely consistent with Doppler broadening.   
All  of  the  above  arguments  apply  to  the  line  broadening  observed  in  the  present  work.  
 
Thus, we conclude that some of the hydrogen atoms (between 10 and 45 percent, Figure 4) in the 
water  plasma  are  selectively  ‘heated’  to  extremely  high  temperatures,  450,000  to  700,000  K.  
About  half  of  the  remaining  hydrogen  (‘cold’)  produces  line  broadening  consistent  not  with  a 
Doppler  effect,  but  rather  with  a  combination  of  Stark  effect,  instrument  effects,  etc.    A  third 
type of hydrogen (‘warm’) may be due to a catalytic effect of hydrogen alone when maintained 
in high concentration such found on the surface of the cathode as reported previously [9, 13].  
 

The standard physics models for the generation of the hot hydrogen in  Ar / H2  plasmas 
all include the requirement that the hydrogen ions obtain energy directly from the field [1-7, 26-
28].    The  possibility  that  the  hot  hydrogen  forms  from  collisions  with  hot  gas  species  (ions  or 
atoms) is considered highly unlikely.  First, the cross sections for collisions with H ions are too 
small,  second  spectroscopy  indicates  there  is  little  or  no  hot  argon  of  any  form  present  [27].  
Thus, the selective H broadening is explained only in terms of acceleration of charged H species.  
In fact, there are two classes of models: 1.) those postulating a gas phase mechanism involving 
formation of hot hydrogen near the electrodes, and 2.) those requiring that an H ionic species hits 
the  electrode  resulting  in  energy  transfer  to  absorbed  hydrogen  species  and  consequently  the 
desorption of a hot hydrogen atom.  In the ‘bombardment’ models hydrogen species on electrode 
+,  or  H +  ions  [3,  27],  and  subsequently 
surfaces  are  ‘hit’  by  energized  ions,  generally  H3
ejected  as  hot  hydrogen  [27-28].    In  all  cases,  these  models  only  predict  selective  hydrogen 
+ [3] 
broadening in high field regions.  In the gas production model, a hydrogen ion such as  H3
that  is  increased  in  concentration  by  interactions  of  H2   with  Ar ,  is  accelerated  by  the  field 
toward  an  electrode,  captures  an  electron  via  interaction  with  an  Ar ,  dissociates  to  form  n=3 
state hydrogen, or forms n=3 state hydrogen via collision with a neutral  Ar  [27], and then emits. 
There does not appear to be any variation on those standard physics models capable of 
 
explaining the observations of the present work.  First, hot hydrogen was found throughout the 
chamber rather than only in the vicinity of the electrodes.   Hot hydrogen ions created near the 
electrodes  simply  cannot  migrate  15  cm  without  equilibrating  with  the  plasma  gas.    Given  a 
maximum  computed  mean  free  path  of  the  hot  hydrogen  of  10 −4   cm  at  0.1  Torr,  the  high 
temperature would have to remain undiminished through 10 5  collisions to be observed at 15 cm 
distance from the electrode.  The excitation temperature of the ‘parent’ atomic hydrogen species 
was only about 5000 K (approximately 0.5 eV), and as the excitation temperature of RF plasmas 
is  generally  associated  with  the  electron  temperature  [30-32].    This  means  that  the  internal 
temperature  of  the  atomic  hydrogen,  as  well  as  the temperature of the electrons in the plasma, 
were about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the hot hydrogen.  Thus, any conventional 

+,  H2

8 

model must explain how H atoms can be two orders of magnitude hotter than the electrons in the 
GEC plasmas studied. 
Even relatively obscure postulated processes were considered as mechanisms to provide 
 
the observed energy of the hot hydrogen atoms.  For example, the ‘Frank-Condon’ effect [33-37] 
will create ‘hot’ neutrals with energies between 2 and 4.5 eV via wall reactions of the type: 
 

+ + e− → 2H

H2

Clearly,  the  energy  of  neutral  species  created  in  this  fashion  do  not  match  the  energies  of  the 
neutrals observed in this study. 
In  sum,  it  is  untenable  to  suggest  modifications  of  the  earlier  models  can  explain  the 
 
present  data.    For  example,  all  earlier  models  require  acceleration  of  ions  in  the  high  field 
(unscreened)  regions  near  the  electrodes.  The  earlier  models  also  include  other  specific 
predictions, such as preferential population of n=3 states, which are not observed.  The gas phase 
models must be rejected for two additional reasons.  First, they all require a high cross section 
for charge transfer, peculiar to argon and hydrogen ions, to allow for the rapid charge transfer 
necessary to create neutral, high energy  H2 , which must be formed before high energy (neutral) 
H atoms can form.  There was no argon in the plasmas studied for this work.  Second, the  H2  
lines  were  not  observed  to  be  broadened.    Third,  it  is  not  plausible  to  suggest  that  the  fields 
found  15  cm  from  the  electrode  are  as  strong  as  those  found  in  the  boundary  layer  near  the 
electrodes.  Field screening by the sheath reduces the fields dramatically within millimeters, and 
a highly conductive plasma bulk is essentially equipotential [6].  Yet, the hot hydrogen found at 
15 cm from the electrodes was of the same energy as that found between the electrodes.  This 
third  objection  to  the  gas  phase  models  clearly  also  shows  the  ‘bombardment’  models  to  be 
implausible.  Indeed, how can a hot hydrogen atom generated at the electrode by bombardment 
traverse  15  cm  of  the  plasma  without  loosing  energy  or  thermalizing?    Clearly,  the  electrode 
bombardment models are not consistent with the finding of the present study that the degree of 
broadening was the same throughout the plasma volume.   

Moreover,  we  cannot  identify  any  previously  proposed  mechanism  that  can  produce 
hydrogen atoms with an average energy of about 45 eV for the water plasma, nearly twice the 
average energy observed for  He / H2  plasmas generated in an identical system [19].  Why is this 
process completely absent in the  Xe / H2  plasmas?  What ‘energy from the field’ process would 
produce neutrals with energies two orders of magnitude higher than those of the electrons in the 
plasma? 
 
These  results  extend  the  list  of  successfully  predicted  rt-plasma  catalysts  [8-20,  22-23, 
26-30, 38-40] to include oxygen which under the studied conditions produces more energetic H 
than  He+   [19].    Under  plasma  discharge  [41-44]  and  the  inherent  photolysis  conditions  [45] 
water is known to undergo decomposition to primarily hydrogen atoms and hydroxyl radials, and 

9 

the hydroxyl radicals can further form hydrogen and oxygen atoms.  The oxygen can serve as a 
catalyst  for  atomic  hydrogen  to  release  EUV  light  and  fast  H  as  reported  previously  [22,  46].  
The energy released is sufficient to account for the observed excitation and Doppler energies.  

 The catalysis reaction requires atomic hydrogen and atomic or molecular oxygen.  These 
species  are  favored  to  form  at  low  pressures,  which  is  consistent  with  the  observed  pressure 
dependence.  The pressure dependence could also be explained somewhat by field acceleration, 
but  it  can  not  explain  why  only  the  hydrogen  lines  are  broadened  at  low  pressure,  and  Stark 
broadening would be anticipated at high pressure, the opposite of the observed dependency.   

Only the rt-plasma mechanism is consistent with all of the observations.  Since additional 
such reactions of varying energies are possible as discussed previously [14-15, 20], the particular 
conditions  in  the  cell  may  favor  more  than  one  H  population.    Collisional  energy  transfer 
between fast H and matrix gas may also give rise to a bimodal or trimodal distribution.

excess of 40 eV.  (a) At 0.08 Torr, 150 W, Position 3, Doppler broadening from H atoms with 
energies  greater  than  40  eV  is  seen  at  the  base  of  the  Hα  peak.  No  ‘hot’  hydrogen  is  seen  at 
higher pressures.  (b) Fitting the lines requires three peaks, for ‘cold’ (<1 eV),  ‘warm’ (<2.5 eV) 
and  ‘hot’  hydrogen.    (c)  Between  the  electrodes  in  control  plasmas  (150  W,  0.05  Torr, 
H2/Xe,20:1) only cold and warm  hydrogen are found. Away from the electrode region only cold 
hydrogen is present.

FIGURE 2. Hα broadening indicates ‘hot’ atomic hydrogen energy a function of pressure but not 
position. (a) At 100 W the broadening is approximately 40 eV up to a pressure of 0.08 Torr.  (b) 
At 150 W the measured broadening is approximately 45 eV up to a pressure of about 0.08 Torr.  
(c) At 200 W the measured broadening is above 45 eV up to a pressure of nearly 0.10 Torr.  In 
all cases the ‘warm’ hydrogen is less than 2eV and the ‘cold’ hydrogen line width is so small it 
probably  reflects  factors  (natural  line  width,  Stark  effect,  instrument  effects,  etc.)  other  than 
Doppler broadening.  Also note that the ‘hot’ hydrogen Doppler energy drops to between 10 and 
20 eV at pressures above 0.10 Torr.

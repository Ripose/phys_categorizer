Abstract 
We  give  an  overview  of  presentations  and  discussions 
during the Accelerator Working Group Session dedicated 
to  High  Luminosity  Issues  for  a  future  upgrade  of  the 
Frascati e+e− Φ – Factory DAΦNE at the Workshop “e+e− 
in the 1-2 GeV range: Physics and Accelerator Prospects” 
held at Alghero (Italy) on 10-13 September 2003. 
 

1. INTRODUCTION 
      The  first  Session  of  the  Accelerator  Working  Group 
was dedicated to High Luminosity Issues of the DAΦNE 
upgrade.  The  Session  was  entitled  “Beam-Beam 
Interaction”, and included presentations by C. Biscari, M. 
Zobov,  H.  Ikeda,  P.  Raimondi,  A.  Gallo,  and  A. 
Temnykh.  The  main  goal  of  the  discussion  was  to  focus 
on  some  new  ideas  that  may  lead  to  a  substantial 
luminosity increase and also to share the experience with 
other Particle Factories, rather than to review beam-beam 
effects in detail.

2. PARTICLE FACTORIES PLANS 

     To  initiate  the  discussion,  C.  Biscari  presented  an 
overview 
talk  “Upgrade  of  Particle  Factories”  [1] 
describing  several  ideas  and  plans  for  the  luminosity 
increase.  She  clearly  showed  that  a  new  era  for  Particle 
Factories has started: 

-  Both  B-Factories,  KEKB 

and  PEP-II,  have 
successfully  overcome  their  design  luminosities  and, 
at  present,  have  upgrade  plans  with  an  ultimate 
luminosity  goal  of  1036  cm-2  s-1  which  has  to  be 
reached in steps  (see Fig. 1). 

-  The  CESR  collider  will  explore  physics  at  lower 

energies, thus becoming a “τ-charm Factory”. 

-  Upgrade  of  the  Beijing  BEPC  into  BEPC-II  will 
bring  the  Chinese  collider  to  the  particle  Factory 
level in the energy range of 2-5.6 GeV. 

-  The  “Light  Quark  Factory”  VEPP2000  is  under 
construction  in  Novosibirsk  and  it  is  scheduled  to 
start commissioning at the end of next year. 

-  The  upgrade  of  the  Φ-Factory  DAΦNE  is  the  main 

subject of the present Workshop.

(C. Biscari [1]). 

 
   In  addition  to  conventional  ways  to  increase  the 
machine  luminosity,  such  as  shorter  bunches,  smaller 
interaction  point  beta  functions,  more  bunches,  higher 
current,  higher  RF  frequencies  etc.,  the  following  ideas 
are under consideration and have yet to be tested: 

round beams (VEPP-2000); 

crab-crossing collisions (KEKB); 

four beams compensation scheme (KEKB); 

lattice  with  a  negative  momentum  compaction 
(DAΦNE, KEKB, BEPC-II). 

The  DAΦNE  Team  has  come  up  with  three  new  ideas 
described  in  the  talks  of  M.  Zobov,  P.  Raimondi  and  A. 
Gallo during this Session. 

3. NEGATIVE MOMENTUM 
COMPACTION 
     The  DAΦNE  lattice  is  flexible  enough  to  provide 
collider operation with a negative momentum compaction 
factor αC. This can be considered as an intermediate step 
in  the  DAΦNE  luminosity  upgrade  without  substantial 
hardware  changes  (M.  Zobov  [3]).  There  can  be  several 
advantages

-  Bunches  are  shorter,  with  a  more  regular  shape. 
Shorter  bunches  are  preferable  for  both  peak 
luminosity  increase  and  beam  lifetime  improvement, 

since  the  transverse  beta  functions  at  the  IP  can  be 
reduced  without  limitations  due  to  the  hour-glass 
effect and, in addition, the Piwinski angle is lower in 
collisions  with  a  crossing  angle,  as  in  the  case  of 
DAΦNE and KEKB. 

observe  a  typical  bunch  length  behaviour  with  the 
negative  momentum  compaction:  below  the  microwave 
instability  threshold,  the  bunch  gets  shorter  due  to  the 
potential  well  distortion  and  the  bunch  length  starts 
growing above the threshold.

-  Longitudinal  beam-beam  effects  are  less  dangerous. 
In particular, the coherent and incoherent instabilities 
due  to  the  longitudinal  kick  during  beam-beam 
collisions  do  not 
take  place  with  a  negative 
momentum  compaction.  Moreover,  the  beam-beam 
synchrobetatron  resonances  are  less  harmful  in  this 
case [4]. 

-  The  microwave  instability  threshold  is  higher  [5]. 
(However,  as  the  experience  shows,  this  depends 
much  on  the  actual  machine  coupling  impedance 
[6,7]). 

- 

the  head-tail 

Since 
instability  with  a  negative 
momentum  compaction  takes  place  with  positive 
chromaticity,  the  requirements  on  the  sextupole 
strength can be relaxed. Indeed, in the SUPER-ACO 
it  has  been  possible  to  store  100  mA  in  a  single 
bunch without sextupoles [7]. 

Numerical  simulations  of  the  bunch  lengthening  in 
DAΦNE  with  negative  momentum  compaction  were 
based on the calculated wake potential, which has already 
been  successfully  applied  for  bunch  lengthening  and 
microwave  threshold  predictions  [8].  It  has  been  shown 
that  for  αC  =  -  0.024  it  is  possible  to  keep  the  bunch 
length below 1.5 cm up to a bunch current of 30 mA. This 
will  allow  reducing  the  vertical  beta  function  at  the  IP 
down to 1.5 cm. 

Subsequent  numerical  simulations  of  beam-beam  effects 
with  LIFETRAC  [9],  taking  into  account  the  calculated 
bunch  length,  indicate  that  by  shifting  the  working  point 
close to an integer and switching to a lattice with negative 
momentum  compaction,  it  is  possible  to  push  DAΦNE 
luminosity up to the 1033 cm-2 s-1 level. 

     The  idea  of  a  negative  momentum  compaction  seems 
to  be  quite  obvious  and  transparent,  since  it  has  been 
proposed  independently  for  KEKB  [10]  and  it  is  also 
under  consideration  for  BEPC-II  (C.  Zhang  [11]). 
Moreover,  the  KEKB  team  managed  to  implement  an 
lattice  with  negative  compaction  and 
experimental 
measured  the  bunch  length  just  a  few  days  before  the 
Summer 2003 collider shut down (H. Ikeda [12]).  

The  bunch  length  has  been  measured  by  three  different 
methods, namely detection of two different frequencies of 
the  bunch  spectrum  by  a  button  electrode,  beam-induced 
fields  in  an  RF  wave-guide,  and  streak  camera.  The 
results consistently show a bunch length reduction in both 
HER  and  LER  rings  with  a  negative  momentum 
compaction lattice.  

An  example  of  the  measurement  with  the  RMS  bunch 
length button monitor is shown in Fig. 2. It is possible to

4. COLLISIONS UNDER LARGE 
CROSSING ANGLE 

     P.  Raimondi  proposed  to  use  high  energy  beams 
colliding at a large crossing angle to get low energy in the 
center of mass: Ecm = 2 E cos(φ) [13]. In this case, several 
advantages  of  high  energy  colliders  can  be  exploited  for 
the luminosity increase at the low center of mass energy.  
The most relevant ones are: 

-  Tune  shifts  scale  with  1/Energy  (E),  leading  to  a 
fundamental  quadratic  increase  of  the  luminosity 
versus  energy  provided  that  the  number  of  particles 
per bunch scales linearly with E. 

-  Radiation  damping  times  decrease  with  1/E3  leading 

to higher limits for tune shifts. 
-  Touschek effect decreases with 1/E3. 

-  Natural bunch length is shorter. 

-  Beam  is  stiffer:  single  and  multi-bunch  instabilities 

growth times increase with E. 

Possible significant advantages can also come from: 

-  A  simple  and  more  flexible  IR  design.  Due  to  the 
large crossing angle, the final focus quadrupoles can 
be  moved  closer  to  the  IP,  thus  providing  smaller 
betas at the IP with lower chromaticity; 

-  Kaons will be boosted, so it may be possible to have 

the detector decoupled from the IR. 

-  Reversing  the  direction  of  one  of  the  beams,  it  may 
be possible to increase the center of mass energy thus 
allowing the high energy solution as well. 

There  are  two  possible  options  in  the  scheme  with  large 
crossing angle: with and without crab-crossing.  

In  the  “no  crab-crossing  case”  the  luminosity  is 
reduced  by  the  factor  σx/(σz  tan(φ)).  However,  the 
tune  shifts  and  the  interaction  length  are  also 
reduced,  leading  to  smaller  design  emittances  and 
vertical  beta  function  at  the  IP.  For  this  option  the 
shorter bunch length and stronger damping would be 
particularly preferable in order to reduce the Piwinski 
angle  and  to  cope  with  beam-beam  synchro-betatron 
resonances [14]. In addition, with shorter bunches the 
luminosity reduction factor becomes smaller. 

-  The  “crab-crossing”  is  still  possible  at  the  relatively 
low  energies  under  consideration,  but  usage  of 
superconducting 
is  mandatory.  The 
luminosity  does  not  change  with  the  crossing  angle, 
however,  the  interaction  length  at  the  IP  is  longer, 
leading  to  an  increase  of  the  minimum  vertical  beta 
with a corresponding luminosity loss. 

cavities 

According  to  the  luminosity  expectation  at  the  Φ-
resonance  energy,  a  luminosity  within  a  factor  of  4 
around the 1034   cm-2 s-1 range could be obtained with this 
new scheme.

5. STRONG RF FOCUSING 

     The  innovative  idea  of  a  strong  RF  focusing  in  a 
collider  [15]  was  presented  at  the  Session  by  A.  Gallo 
[16].  As  it  is  well  known,  the  luminosity  of  a  circular 
collider  can  be  increased  by  decreasing  the  bunch length 
and  the  beta  functions.  A  natural  way  to  decrease  the 
bunch  length  is  to  decrease  the  momentum  compaction 
factor and/or to increase the RF voltage. However, in such 
a  way  short  bunches  cannot  be  obtained  with  high  beam 
currents,  since  wake  fields  prevent  this  through  the 
potential  well  distortion  and  the  microwave  instability. 

longitudinally 

The  proposed  strong  RF  focusing  (with  high  RF  voltage 
and  high  momentum  compaction  factor)  can  be  used  to 
its 
focus 
progressive  lengthening  towards  the  RF  cavity.  This 
allows  placing  the  major  sources  of  impedance  near  the 
RF  cavity,  where  the  bunch  is  longest,  thus  minimizing 
the effect of the wake fields.  

the  bunch  at 

the  IP  with 

As  it  was  shown  the  bunch  length  excursion  depends 
strongly  on  the  longitudinal  phase  advance.  When  the 
phase advance tends to 180 degrees, the ratio of the bunch 
length  at  the  RF  cavity  position  and  at  the  IP  goes  to 
infinity. An important feature of the strong RF focusing is 
that  the  equilibrium  energy  spread  also  depends  on  the 
longitudinal  phase  advance.    Figure  3  shows  a  good 
agreement  between  the  bunch  length  and  the  energy 
spread obtained analytically and by numerical simulations 
as  a  function  of 
  Finally,  a 
hypothetical set of parameters for a Φ-factory aimed at a 
luminosity  of  1034  cm-2  s-1  was  analysed,  with  the 
conclusion that it is possible to obtain a bunch length of 2 
mm at the IP.

6. BEAM-BEAM EXPERIENCE AT VEPP-4 

     The  right  choice  of  working  point  is  crucial  for  a 
successful collider performance.  

A.  Temnykh  presented  the  results  of  his  experimental 
study of the luminosity dependence on the working point 
position  for  VEPP-4  [17].  A  2D tune scan technique has 
been used to explore the tune plane measuring the vertical 
beam size from luminosity values and positron beam loss 
rates.  A  variety  of  resonances  excited  by  machine 
nonlinearity  and  beam-beam  interaction  affecting  the 
luminosity  and  the  beam  lifetime  was  observed  and 
identified.  The  tune  scan  has  suggested  an  optimal 
working point close to half-integer tunes. This conclusion 
is  also  in  accordance  with  the  experience  of  PEP-II, 
KEKB and CESR. 

     Another  subject  presented  by  A.  Temnykh  is  the 
influence of the machine nonlinearities on the beam-beam 
interaction  [17].  By  applying  an  analytical  model 
including  beam-beam  effects  and  a  cubic  machine 
nonlinearity  (octupoles),  he  has  shown  that  the  cubic 
nonlinearity  may  dramatically  change  the  beam-beam 
interaction  dynamics.  In  this  sense  not  only  the  strength 
of  the  cubic  nonlinearity  is  important,  but  also  its  sign. 
This  is  also  confirmed  by  the  DAΦNE  experience  [18]. 
Experimentally  it  was  found  that  for  VEPP-4  the  cubic 
nonlinearity  must  be  kept  close  to  zero  for  optimum 
collider performance and that a negative nonlinearity may 
be a little bit less harmful than a positive one. 

7. CONCLUSIONS 

 
In conclusion, several new ideas to substantially increase 
machine  luminosity  can  and  will  be  tested  in  the  near 
future: 
 
-  Crab cavities (KEK-B); 

-  Collisions with round beams (VEPP2000); 

-  Negative momentum compaction and strong damping 

(KEK-B, DAΦNE); 

- 

Strong RF focusing (CESR?). 

The  approach  of  the  DAΦNE  machine  team  is  sound, 
since a luminosity of 1034 cm-2 s-1 is already a challenging 
target.  Reaching a luminosity of 1035 cm-2 s-1needs many 
combined  new  ideas/technologies  and  is  thus  associated 
with higher risks and a longer time scale.

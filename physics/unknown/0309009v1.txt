Abstract

A survey was carried out to determine activity concentration levels and associated

dose rates from the naturally occurring radionuclides 232Th, 238U, and 40K, in the

various geological formations appearing throughout the geographically accessible

area of Cyprus, by means of high-resolution γ−ray spectrometry. A total number of

115 representative soil samples were collected from all over the bedrock surface of

the island, based on the different lithological units of the study area, sieved through a

0.2-mm mesh, sealed in 1000-mL plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the

laboratory with respect to their gamma radioactivity for a counting time of 18 hours

each. From the measured spectra, activity concentrations were determined for 232Th

(range from 1.0×10−2 to 39.8 Bq kg−1), 238U (from 1.0×10−2 to 39.3 Bq kg−1) and 40K

(from 4.0×10−2 to 565.8 Bq kg−1). Gamma absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were

calculated to be in the range of 1.1×10−2 − 51.3 nGy h−1, depending on the geological

features, with an overall mean value of 8.7 nGy h−1 and a standard deviation of 8.4

nGy h−1. This value is by a factor of about 7 below the corresponding population-

weighted world-averaged value of 60 nGy h−1 reported by UNSCEAR (2000), and

one of the lowest that has been reported from similar investigations worldwide.

Assuming a 20% occupancy factor, the corresponding effective dose rates outdoors

equivalent to the population were calculated to be between 1.3×10−2 and 62.9 µSv y−1,

with an arithmetic mean value of 10.7 µSv y−1 and a standard deviation of 10.3

µSv y−1.

INTRODUCTION

The great interest expressed worldwide for the study of naturally occurring radiation

and environmental radioactivity has led to the performance of extensive surveys in

many countries (see UNSCEAR 2000 Report, and further references cited therein).

Such investigations can be useful for both the assessment of public dose rates and the

performance of epidemiological studies, as well as to keep reference-data records, in

order to be able to ascertain possible changes in the environmental radioactivity due

to nuclear, industrial, and other human activities.

Natural environmental radioactivity arises mainly from primordial radionuclides,

such as 40K, and the radionuclides from the 232Th and 238U series and their decay

products, which occur at

trace levels in all ground formations. Primordial

radionuclides are formed by the process of nucleosynthesis in stars and are

characterized by half-lives comparable to the age of the earth.

Gamma radiation emitted from those naturally occurring radioisotopes, also called

terrestrial background radiation, represents the main external source of irradiation of

2

the human body. More specifically, natural environmental radioactivity and the

associated external exposure due to gamma radiation depend primarily on the

geological and geographical conditions, and appear at different levels in the soils of

each region in the world (UNSCEAR 2000 Report). The specific levels of terrestrial

environmental

radiation are related to the geological composition of each

lithologically separated area, and to the content of the rock from which the soils

originate in each area in the radioactive elements of thorium (Th), uranium (U) and

potassium (K). In terms of natural radioactivity, it is well known, for instance, that

igneous rocks of granitic composition are strongly enriched in Th and U (on an

average 15 ppm† of Th and 5 ppm of U), compared to rocks of basaltic or ultramafic

composition (< 1 ppm of U)

(Faure 1986; Mènager et al. 1993). For that reason,

higher radiation levels are associated with igneous rocks and lower levels with

sedimentary rocks. There are exceptions, however, as some shales and phosphate

rocks have relatively high content of those radionuclides (UNSCEAR 2000 Report).

The island of Cyprus is located in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean Sea and

extends to an area of about 9,300 km2. The characteristic geological formations

appearing through the bedrock surface of the island can be classified into two main

categories: those that belong to an ophiolite complex and those of sedimentary origin.

The Cyprus ophiolite is one of the best-preserved and most intensively studied

ophiolite complexes in the world, and is known as the Troodos Massif or Troodos

Ophiolitic Complex (Moores and Vine 1971; Robinson and Malpas 1998). It consists

of basic and ultrabasic pillow lavas, fringed by andesitic-sheeted dykes, while the

central part of the ophiolite is composed of basic and ultrabasic plutonic rocks

(gabbros, peridotites, dunites and serpentinized harzburgites). The weathering of the

† Parts per million

3

rocks of sedimentary origin (mainly chalks, marls, sandstones, gypsum, etc.) in the

foothills that fringe Troodos mountains, gave rise to a diversity of alkaline, calcium-

rich soils (Robinson and Malpas 1998). On the other hand, rocks of ophiolitic origin

are mostly iron- and magnesium-saturated or oversaturated, and this allows their

characterization as basic and ultrabasic. None of these rock types belongs to the

category of silica-oversaturated, which usually is associated with high Th and U

elemental concentrations (Faure 1986).

With the objective to obtain the first systematic data on environmental radiation and

radioactivity for Cyprus, a pilot project was commenced in 2001. The first results of a

feasibility study were reported by Tzortzis et al. (2003), based on a relatively

restricted but rather representative number of samples (28) collected from the typical

geological rock formations appearing in the island. Other parts of the project aimed at

measuring the concentration of radon in houses and public buildings (Anastasiou et

al. 2003), as well as at detecting α−emitting radioisotopes by means of radio-

analytical techniques and high-resolution α-spectrometry (Pashalidis and Tsertos

2003).

A follow-up, extensive and completed study of terrestrial gamma radioactivity was

performed after the collection of 115 soil samples over all the island bedrock surface

based on the different lithological units of the study area. Such a number of collected

samples in combination with the relatively large area portion covered by this study

(about 6,000 km2) can be considered as a representative inventory of the various

outcropping geological formations. One of the main features that make the present

investigation particularly important and interesting to radiometric studies is the fact

that it provides information on the geomorphological composition and associated

environmental radioactivity of such an area with a large variety of ophiolitic and

4

sedimentary rock types cropping out over a relatively narrow area. In this paper, the

results from this extensive and representative study regarding activity concentrations

and associated gamma dose rates due to naturally occurring radionuclides in a wide

variety of surface soils utilizing high-resolution γ−ray spectrometry are presented.

The experiments have been carried out in the Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the

Department of Physics, University of Cyprus.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Gamma-ray spectrometry system

A high-resolution spectrometry system was used for the detection of the emitted

gamma rays and the measurement of the resulting energy spectrum. The system is

based on a high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector (coaxial cylinder of 55 mm in

diameter and 73 mm in length) that is characterized by 33% efficiency, relative to a

3″×3″ NaI(Tl) scintillator, and by 1.8 keV energy resolution (FWHM) at the 1.33 MeV

reference transition of 60Co. Further details of the system are presented elsewhere

(Tzortzis et al. 2003).

The energy-dependent detection photopeak efficiency has been determined on an

absolute scale by means of a calibrated 152Eu gamma reference source‡, sealed in a

standard 1000-mL Marinelli beaker, that is characterized by an average density of 1

g cm−3 and an initial activity of 10.1 kBq kg−1. Considering an uncertainty of 3% in

the source activity, the mean uncertainty in the calculated efficiency is estimated to be

about 5%. Depending on the peak background, the Minimum Detectable Activity

(MDA) was calculated to be 1.0×10−2 Bq kg−1 for both 232Th and 238U, and 4.0×10−2

Bq kg−1 for 40K, for the counting time of 18 hours.

Sample collection and counting

A total number of 115 surface soil samples has been collected throughout the

accessible area of Cyprus§ (Fig. 1), which widely covered all the geological surface

formations of the island. More specifically, the official geological map of Cyprus

(GSDC 1995) was used to segregate the accessible island’s area into seven different

geological regions indicated in the simplified map shown in Fig. 1. Ten to twenty-

eight soil samples were collected from different

locations falling within the

boundaries of each of the seven geological regions considered. Special emphasis was

given to the Troodos Ophiolitic Complex, from which more than half (59) of the total

number of samples was collected.

Samples were collected according to the internationally established experience. For

each soil sample collected, an area of about 0.5 m × 0.5 m was marked and carefully

cleared of debris to a few-centimeter depth. Surface soils were then taken from

different places randomly within the marked and cleared area and mixed together

thoroughly, in order to obtain a representative sample of that area. Each soil sample

was labeled according to the geographical coordinates of the sampling area, and those

coordinates were later used to draw a point

into the right position on the

corresponding simplified geological map shown in Fig. 1.

Collected soil samples were sieved through 0.2-mm mesh, hermetically sealed in

standard 1000-mL plastic Marinelli beakers, dry-weighed and stored for about four

weeks prior to counting. This allowed establishment of equilibrium between 226Ra

by force since 1974 (see Fig. 1).

and 222Rn and its decay products, although non-equilibrium is uncommon in rocks

older than 106 years, and the 232Th series may be considered in equilibrium in most

geological environments (Chiozzi et al. 2002).

Each prepared soil container was placed into the shielded HPGe detector and

measured for an accumulating time of 18 hours, in order to obtain a statistically small

error (3-5%) for the γ−ray peaks of interest. The naturally occurring radionuclides

considered in the present analysis of the measured γ−ray spectra are: 212Pb (with a

main gamma energy at ∼239 keV and a gamma yield of ∼43.1%), 214Pb (∼352 keV,

∼37.1%), 214Bi (∼609 keV, ∼46.1%), 228Ac (∼911 keV, ∼29%), and 40K (∼1461 keV,

∼10.7%). Since secular equilibrium was reached between 232Th and 238U and their

decay products,

the concentration of 232Th was determined from the average

concentrations of 212Pb and 228Ac in the samples, and that of 238U was determined

from the average concentrations of the 214Pb and 214Bi decay products (Hamby and

Tynybekov 2000; Tzortzis et al. 2003). Thus, an accurate radionuclide concentration

of 232Th and 238U was obtained, whereas a direct measurement of 40K concentration

was achieved. Prior to the sample measurement,

the environmental gamma-ray

background at the laboratory site has been determined using an empty Marinelli

beaker under identical measurement conditions. It has been later subtracted from the

measured γ−ray spectra of each sample.

Calculation of activity concentrations and dose rates

Following the spectrum analysis, count rates for each detected photopeak and activity

per mass unit (activity concentration) for each of the detected nuclides are calculated.

The activity concentration (in Bq kg−1),

EiA , of a nuclide i and for a peak at energy E,

is given by:

7

A
Ei

=

N
Ei
t M
ε γ
E
d

s

(1)

where

EiN is the Net Peak Area of a peak at energy Ε,

Eε is the detection efficiency

at energy Ε, t is the counting live-time,

dγ is the gamma ray yield per disintegration

of the specific nuclide for a transition at energy E, and Ms is the mass (dry weight) in

kg of the measured sample. If, for the radionuclide considered, there is more than one

peak in the energy range of analysis (50−3,000 keV), then the peak activities are

averaged and the result is the weighted average nuclide activity.

The total uncertainty of the radioactivity measurements, which is also applicable to

the calculated gamma dose and effective dose rates, was typically in the range

3−10%. It has been calculated by taking into consideration the counting statistical

error (∼3%) and other weighted systematic errors that mainly include the uncertainty

in the efficiency calibration (0.5−8%).

If naturally occurring radionuclides are uniformly distributed, dose rates, D, at 1 m

above the ground surface in units of nGy h−1 can be calculated by the following

formula:

D = AEi × CF

(2)

where AEi is the activity concentration measured in Bq kg−1, and CF is the dose

conversion factor in units of nGy h−1 Bq−1 kg (absorbed dose rate in air per unit of

activity concentration). In the present work, mean dose conversion factors of 0.52813,

0.38919, and 0.03861 nGy h−1 Bq−1 kg for the 232Th and 238U series, and for 40K,

respectively, were used in all dose rate calculations (Tzortzis et al. 2003) that are

8

obtained by recent Monte Carlo techniques (Clouvas et al. 2000, and further

references cited therein).

Finally, in order to estimate the annual effective doses, a value of 0.7 Sv Gy−1 was

used for the conversion coefficient from absorbed dose in air to effective dose

received by adults, and 0.2 for the outdoor occupancy factor (UNSCEAR 2000

Report). Thus, the effective dose rate outdoors, HE, in units of µSv y−1, is calculated

by the following formula:

HE = D × T × F

(3)

where D is the calculated dose rate (in nGy h−1), T is the outdoor occupancy time (0.2

×××× 24 h ×××× 365.25 d ≅ 1753 h y−1), and F is the absorbed-to-effective dose conversion

factor (0.7××××10−3 Sv Gy−1).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

For the purpose of quality assurance, a standard sample from the reference soil

material IAEA-326 was prepared in an identical 1000-mL Marinelli beaker (dry soil

mass of 1.254 kg), and further treated with respect to the measurement and analysis

procedure as an unknown sample. The results obtained and the certified values

(Bojanowski 2001) are summarized in table 1. As can be seen, the certified mean

values of the 232Th, 238U, and 40K activity concentrations are reproduced by the

measurements with a relative deviation of 8.5%, 10%, and 0.5%, respectively,

demonstrating the very good performance of the measurement and analysis technique

utilized. Also, the measured activity concentration values from the soil samples

presented have been checked regarding their reproducibility and consistency by

repeating the measurement and analysis procedure for a number of samples, selected

9

randomly among the initially stored 115 samples, after a time of 9 to 12 months from

their first measurement.

In all cases examined, the measured activities of the first

measurement could be reproduced by the repeated measurement within 5 to 13%.

The calculated activity concentrations of 232Th, 238U and 40K for the 115 samples

collected from all over the island bedrock surface based on the different lithological

units of the study area are plotted in Fig. 2. As mentioned before, such a number of

collected samples in combination with the relatively large island area portion covered

by this study can be considered as a representative inventory of the various

outcropping geological formations. It can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 that higher values

of activity concentrations are associated with formations of sedimentary origin

(regions R1, R2, R3 and R5) and lower values are associated with formations

belonging to the Troodos ophiolitic complex (regions R4, R6 and R7). In particular,

region R4, which covers the central part of the Troodos massif that contains basic and

ultrabasic plutonic rocks (see legend in Fig. 1), presents the lowest activity

concentrations of 232Th, 238U, and 40K.

Activity concentrations of 232Th ranged from 1.0×10−2 to 39.8 Bq kg−1, from 1.0×10−2

to 39.3 Bq kg−1 for 238U, and from 4.0×10−2 to 565.8 Bq kg−1 for 40K. It should be

noted that the lower values given correspond to the detection limit (MDA) derived for

each of the three radionuclides, since some samples (mainly from region R4)

exhibited nearly zero or even negative activity concentrations after the subtraction of

the laboratory ambient background. In general, activity concentrations of 232Th and

238U are rather low in all the samples measured; this is particularly observable in

ophiolites, which contain the lowest concentrations of those radionuclides. The

frequency distribution of the measured 232Th, 238U and 40K activity concentrations for

the whole dataset is presented in Fig. 3.

10

Table 2 presents the averaged concentrations for each one of the seven geological

regions studied. It is clearly indicated that the highest mean activity concentrations of

232Th, 238U and 40K were measured in soil samples belonging to sedimentary

formations, whereas the corresponding mean activity concentrations associated with

soils that stem from the Troodos ophiolitic complex are significantly lower. To be

more precise, the average activity concentration of 232Th, 238U, and 40K in samples of

sedimentary origin ranged from 5.7 to 16.7 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 9.3 ± 8.1 Bq kg−1,

from 9.6 to 21.9 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 13.2 ± 8.8 Bq kg−1, and from 116.8 to 190.2

Bq kg−1 with a mean of 146.9 ± 97.6 Bq kg−1, respectively. The corresponding activity

concentration values in soils of ophiolitic origin ranged from 0.3 to 1.8 Bq kg−1 with a

mean of 1.0 ± 1.4 Bq kg−1, from 0.5 to 2.5 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 1.3 ± 1.3 Bq kg−1,

and from 27.8 to 158.2 Bq kg−1 with a mean of 64.4 ± 72.0 Bq kg−1, respectively.

Calculated arithmetic mean values in all samples of both sedimentary and ophiolitic

origin are: 5.0 ± 7.1, 7.1 ± 8.6, and 104.6 ± 94.6 Bq kg−1, for 232Th, 238U and 40K

activity concentrations, respectively, while revised median values derived from all

data available worldwide (UNSCEAR Report 2000) are: 30, 35 and 400 Bq kg−1,

respectively. This reveals that the mean activity concentration levels measured in

Cyprus from naturally occurring radioisotopes are by a factor of four to six lower than

the corresponding values obtained worldwide. Region 5, which is mainly composed

of calcarenites and sandstones, shows the highest activity concentration in 232Th and

40K radionuclides with mean values of 16.7 ± 9.4 and 190.2 ± 94.7 Bq kg−1,

respectively, while Region 2, mainly composed of chalks, marls and gypsum, exhibits

the highest activity concentration in 238U with a mean of 21.9 ± 10.2 Bq kg−1.

Although comparable and within the range of some worldwide areas, the above

11

presented highest mean activity concentrations of 232Th, 238U and 40K are still

distinctly below the corresponding worldwide mean activity concentration values

reported in the UNSCEAR 2000 Report.

The gamma absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were calculated from the

concentrations of each of the nuclides of 232Th and 238U series, and of 40K, using

equation (2), and the individual results were summed up in order to obtain the total

absorbed dose rate in air due to gamma radiation from those radionuclides. Figure 4

shows the calculated total gamma absorbed dose in air outdoors due to the 232Th,

238U, and 40K radionuclides, while in Fig. 5 the frequency distribution of the total

absorbed dose rates for all the measured 115 soil samples is plotted. Again, higher

total absorbed dose rates are associated with soil samples originated from formations

of sedimentary origin (regions R1, R2, R3, and R5) and lower values are associated

with soil samples stemming from the Troodos ophiolitic complex (regions R4, R6,

and R7). More specifically, the total dose rates in air outdoors calculated for samples

of sedimentary origin ranged from 1.1 to 51.3 nGy h−1 with a mean of 14.3 ± 8.3

nGy h−1 and from 1.1×10−2 to 16.9 nGy h−1 with a mean of 3.3 ± 3.5 nGy h−1 for

samples of ophiolitic origin. The arithmetic mean value of the total absorbed dose rate

over all samples amounts to 8.7 nGy h−1 with a standard deviation of 8.4 nGy h−1. It is

worth emphasizing in this context that nearly all the samples of ophiolitic origin

(regions R4, R6 and R7), and particularly those of region R4, exhibited total absorbed

dose rates that are distinctly below the mean average value of 8.7 nGy h−1 (see also

Fig. 4).

In table 3, the results of the average gamma absorbed dose rate due to the 232Th, 238U

and 40K radionuclides obtained from each of

the seven regions studied are

summarized. The average dose rates calculated from concentrations of nuclides of the

12

232Th and the 238U series, and of 40K, in the samples of sedimentary origin, ranged

from 2.2 to 6.4 nGy h−1 with a mean of 3.5 ± 3.1 nGy h−1, from 3.7 to 8.5 nGy h−1

with a mean of 5.1 ± 3.4 nGy h−1, and from 4.5 to 7.3 nGy h−1 with a mean of 5.7 ±

3.8 nGy h−1, respectively. In samples of ophiolitic origin, the corresponding values

ranged from 0.1 to 0.6 nGy h−1 with a mean of 0.4 ± 0.5 nGy h−1, from 0.2 to 1.0

nGy h−1 with a mean of 0.5 ± 0.5 nGy h−1, and from 1.1 to 6.1 nGy h−1 with a mean of

2.5 ± 2.8 nGy h−1, respectively.

Figure 6 shows the calculated relative contribution to the total absorbed dose of each

of the three radionuclides (232Th, 238U, and 40K) for the seven main regions considered

in this study (see legend of Fig.1). As illustrated in Fig. 6, the contribution to total

dose rates due to 40K, 238U and 232Th series for soil samples of sedimentary origin

(regions R1, R2, R3 and R5) is more or less equally shared between those three

radionuclides (∼39%, ∼36% and ∼25%, respectively). On the other hand, in soils of

ophiolitic origin (regions R4, R6, and R7) a major contribution to dose from 40K

(about 75% on an average) is observed, which is significantly higher than those due

to 238U and 232Th series (∼15% and ∼10%, respectively).

Finally, the effective dose rates outdoors estimated according to equation (4) for soil

samples of sedimentary and ophiolitic origin ranged from 1.3 to 62.9 µSv y−1 with a

mean of 17.6 ± 10.2 µSv y−1 and from 1.3×10−2 to 20.7 µSv y−1 with a mean of 4.1 ±

4.3 µSv y−1,

respectively. The calculated mean value in all samples of both

sedimentary and ophiolitic origin is 10.7 ± 10.3 µSv y−1.

The results presented in this paper are in general agreement with the first

measurements of activity concentrations and associated dose rates of naturally

occurring radionuclides in twenty-eight samples from characteristic geological rock

13

types of Cyprus reported by Tzortzis et al. (2003). In that study, soil samples of

sedimentary composition appeared again with higher activity concentration levels of

the radioisotopes of interest than those exhibited by soils of ophiolitic origin as

following: 16.7 ± 3.7 versus 2.1 ± 0.2 Bq kg−1 for 232Th, 21.0 ± 5.5 versus 6.5 ± 4.4

Bq kg−1 for 238U, and 197.5 ± 35.2 versus 147.3 ± 79.3 Bq kg−1 for 40K, for samples of

sedimentary and ophiolitic origin, respectively. Measured mean activity concentra-

tions over all samples were found to be 11.0 ± 13.8, 15.4 ± 20.8, and 177.8 ± 196.4

Bq kg−1, for 232Th, 238U and 40K, respectively. The total absorbed dose rates were

equal to 19.7 ± 3.8 and 7.4 ± 4.1 nGy h−1, for samples of sedimentary and ophiolitic

origin, respectively, with an overall mean value of 14.7 ± 7.3 nGy h−1. Comparison

between the results presented in this paper and those reported by Tzortzis et al. (2003)

is illustrated in table 4. In order to correctly interpret the various results summarized

in table 4, one should notice that in the present study more than half (∼51%) of the

total number of samples collected are of ophiolitic origin, which reveal very low

activity concentration levels compared to those of sedimentary origin. The

corresponding percentage contribution of samples of ophiolitic origin in the first

study (Tzortzis et al. 2003) was ∼39%, and this might explain why the results of the

mean activity and dose rates are slightly higher compared to the corresponding values

in the present study.

CONCLUSION

High-resolution γ−ray spectrometry was exploited to determine activity concentration

and the associated dose rates due to naturally occurring 232Th, 238U, and 40K in 115

surface soil samples collected from all over the island of Cyprus. The number and the

surface distribution of the samples collected can be considered as a representative

14

inventory of the various outcropping geological formations. Soils originated from the

Troodos ophiolitic complex appear generally to present lower naturally occurring

radionuclide concentrations, compared to those of sedimentary origin. In the present

study, arithmetic mean activity concentrations (mean ± S.D.) of 5.0 ± 7.1, 7.1 ± 8.6

and 104.6 ± 94.6 Bq kg−1, for 232Th, 238U and 40K radionuclides, respectively, are

derived from all the soil samples studied. These values fall within the lowest range of

those measured at worldwide scale by other authors and, more specifically, are by a

factor of four to six lower than the world average values of 30, 35, and 400 Bq kg−1,

for 232Th, 238U, and 40K, respectively, reported by UNSCEAR (2000).

Gamma absorbed dose rates in air outdoors were calculated to be in the range of

1.1×10−2 − 51.3 nGy h−1, with an overall mean value of 8.7 nGy h−1 and a standard

deviation of 8.4 nGy h−1. This value is by a factor of about 7 below the corresponding

population-weighted world-averaged value of 60 nGy h−1 and one of the lowest that

has been reported from similar investigations worldwide (UNSCEAR 2000 Report).

As a direct implication of these results, inhabitants of the island are subjected to an

external gamma radiation exposure (effective dose outdoors) that range from 1.3×10−2

to 62.9 µSv y−1 with an arithmetic mean value of 10.7 ± 10.3 µSv y−1, which is

negligibly small compared to the average worldwide exposure of ∼2.4 mSv y−1 due to

natural sources (UNSCEAR 2000 Report).

The results obtained from the present wide-range investigations are in general

agreement with the first studies on activity and elemental concentrations of naturally

occurring radionuclides and on their associated dose rates in various rock types

(Tzortzis et al. 2003). They further confirm that the activity concentration and

associated dose rates due to naturally occurring gamma radiation in Cyprus are

15

significantly lower (by a factor of five on an average) than the corresponding

radioactivity levels reported from other areas worldwide.

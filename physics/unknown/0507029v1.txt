as  Junction-less Transistor  towards  Nano-miniaturization 

R.C. Gupta*,  Ruchi Gupta** and  Sanjay Gupta*** 

Abstract 

 
 
High-Tc  Type-II  ceramic-superconductor  at  temperature  T  <  Tc  ,  under presence  of  magnetic-field  B   becomes 
non-superconducting if B exceeds a critical value Bc2. Thus  at T < Tc, by application/absence of  critical magnetic- field as 
a  controlling  device,  these  non-superconducting/superconductor  states  can  be  achieved    for  current-flow  to  two 
corresponding  states    of    block/pass  or    off/on    or      0/1.  Thus  it  appears  that  there  is  a  possibility  of  a  new  breed  of  
transistors  purely  with  high-Tc    Type-II  ceramic-superconductor;  compact    and    without    junctions  &  complexities.    The 
proposed ceramic-superconductor-transistor (CST) seems in-principle to work well for switching purpose, but its use could 
also  be  extended  for  other  electronic/computer  devices    too.    The  CST,  being  junction-less  thus  diffusion-less,  could 
possibly be packed more closely (at nano-level) than the semi-conductor devices  which has a limitation due to diffusion-
layer-overlapping. A similar superconductor-device named Cryotron was invented at  MIT  half-a-century ago, but could not 
survive  against semiconductor.   CST is a rebirth of cryotron in different disguise & in new perspective. 
 
 
 
 
Introduction 
 
 
The driving force behind every technological-revolution is  ‘material’. Behind industrial-revolution it 
 
is  steel    and  behind  electronic-revolution  it  is  semiconductor.  What  is  the  material  for  next  technological-
revolution ?  Is it superconductor ?  There are many useful & important applications of the superconductors and 
here is one more possible application of it.  Most of  electronic/computer circuits/devices based on transistors 
are  made  of  semiconductors,    the  SQUIDs,  however,  make  use  of  Joshepson-Junction  (JJ)  of  two 
superconductors with an insulating layer in-between; but it is proposed (as an extension of cryotron) here that  
bare ceramic-superconductor could also be used as a new breed of  junction-less transistor  and may even prove 
to be better  in absence of junction defects/problems. 
 
 
 
In digital circuits for electronic/computer devices, the transistor usually is used as a two-state device or 
switch. The state of a transistor can be used to set a voltage on the conducting path/channel to be either high or 
low, representing a binary one or zero. Logical and arithmetic functions are implemented in a circuit built  using 
transistors as switches.  A transistor’s other function is amplification of small input signal to high output signal 
through a controller-parameter, such as through current in BJT and through voltage in FET(MOS).  All  BJT, 
FET, MOSFET including the most popular CMOS for VLSI are basically semi-conductor junction devices [1-3]  
whereas a few others such as SQUIDs use superconductor junctions [4,5]. 
 

The authors do not claim originality of the idea of  using  superconductor as transistor,  credit goes  to 
Prof. Dudley Buck of RLE, MIT (USA) for his then-famous invention [6] of ‘Cryotron’ using  low-Tc  metallic-  
superconductors; the authors however suggest use of high-Tc  ceramic-superconductors in new perspective of 
nano-technology.    Prof.  Buck  was  most  recognized  for  the  development  of  ‘cryotron’,  a  super-conductive 
magnetically controlled gating device that was hailed as a  revolutionary component for miniaturizing the room- 
sized computers of 1950s. His technical paper “The Cryotron – A Superconductive Computer Compound” was 
recognized and awarded  with  the  Browder Thomson Medal  of  the  Institute of  Radio Engineers  (now IEEE)

in  1957.    The  cryotron  is  a  switch  that  operates  using  superconductors,  and  works  on  the  principle  that  the 
magnetic-field  destroys  superconductivity.  The  cryotron  [7]  is  a  piece  of  tantalum  wrapped  with  a  coil  of 
niobium placed in liquid helium bath. When the current flows through the tantalum-wire  it is super-conducting, 
but  when  a  current  flows  through  the  niobium-coil  a  magnetic-field  is  produced  which  destroys  the 
superconductivity of tantalum  thus stopping the current-flow in tantalum.  Historically, first came the vacuum-
tube, then the semiconductor-transistor; the cryotron was destined to spark another revolution in electronics, but 
could not, as the semi-conductors (at room-temperature) succeeded over metallic-superconductors (at very low 
temperature).  The  demise  of  cryotron  was  probably  due  to  rapid developments  in  semiconductor  devices  and 
due to untimely death of  Dudley Buck in 1959. The authors believe that a rebirth of ‘cryotron’ can take place in 
new  shape  &  size  as  ‘CST’;  with  the  advent  of  modern  developments  in  field  of    high-Tc  ceramic-
superconductors, nano-technology & manufacturing-techniques. 
. 
 
A switch/valve (or transistor) usually has 3 terminals  for electron-flow: (i) in (Source), (ii) out (Drain) 
and (iii) control barrier/base (Gate).  The signal can be changed through control terminal signal from ‘this-state’ 
to  ‘that-state’.    The  ‘this/that’  combination  may  be  considered  as    pass/no-pass,  channel  open/closed,  on/off, 
high/low, 1/0 etc;  or in quantum computing (qubit) this/that combination is spin-up/spin-down [3].   
 
 
In  the  present-paper    it  is  to  question  (  &  answer)  the  possibility:    ‘if    a    ceramic-superconductor 
without  junction  can  be  used  as  transistor    specially  as  switching  device    and  if  so  then    how    and      what  is  
‘this/that’  combination  for  it  and  what  are  the  3  terminals  and  what  is  the  signal  with  which    to  control  the 
current-flow’ ?  Also discussed are possible difficulties & prospects and implementation of the proposed CST 
and its future.  
 
 
Superconductors 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is known that certain materials [4-5] show superconductivity (zero resistance) below certain critical -

temperature Tc ; application of certain amount of magnetic-field Bc , however, destroys the superconductivity   
(Meissner-effect).  Based  on  the  penetration  &  response  of  magnetic-field,  there  are  two  types  of 
superconductors: Type-I and Type-II [4,5]. With the application of increasing magnetic-field, Type-I loses its 
superconductivity abruptly whereas Type-II loses its superconductivity gradually. Type-I superconductors have 
very low critical temperature Tc (below which the material is super-conducting) of the order of 10o K whereas  
Type-II  superconductors  are  having  comparatively  high  Tc  upto  of  the  order  of    150o  K.    Type-I 
superconductors  are  usually  pure  metal-conductors.  Type-II  superconductors  are  either  (a)  conducting  metal 
alloys & compounds  or even (b) non-conducting ceramics. Type-II-(a) metal alloys & compounds have Tc of 
the order of 30o K or even higher  whereas Type-II-(b) ceramics, usually called High -Tc superconductors,  now 
have  Tc  of  the  order  of  150o  K    much  higher  than  boiling  point  (77o  K)  of  liquid  nitrogen  -  which  is  easily 
available & affordable  so convenient to use.  
 
Superconductor  have  several  uses  such  as  to  make  high-strength-magnets  for  various  applications 
 
ranging from MLT (bullet-train) to NMR (MRI). The other applications include use of Josephson-Junction (JJ) 
for super-conducting-quantum-interface-devices (SQUIDs) for use as a sensitive magnetometer and high speed 
fluctuating  (switching)  device.  In  JJ(SQUIDs)  two  Type-I  superconductors  have  a  junction  with  a  thin 
insulating  layer  in-between    through  which  the  Cooper-electron-pair  can  tunnel,  it  works  on  overlapping  of 
electron’s wave-functions ϕ on both sides [4,5].  Cryotron is another feasible application discussed earlier;  and 
CST as explained in this paper  could be the next brighter application of superconductor as  futuristic transistor. 
 

It may be noted that Type-I metals and Type-II-(a) metal alloys/compounds  superconducting materials 
are always at-least good-conductors  whether they are in superconducting-state or  not;   whereas     Type-II-(b) 
ceramic superconducting material is excellent-conductor  in  superconducting-state   but  not-so-good-conductor  
 (comparatively, insulator) in non-superconducting-state.  There was a big-boost to the development of super-
conductor research with the surprise discovery of ceramic (insulator) being newer & better superconductor by 
German scientists Bednorz and  Muller [8] in 1986.  Then-after world-wide efforts are on, to get even higher Tc 
ceramic-superconductor with a desire to achieve Tc   up to   room-temperature.

Possibility of Using High-Tc Ceramic-Superconductor as Junction-less Transistor 
 
 
It is well known that in presence of applied magnetic field B at T < Tc, if the field exceeds a certain 
critical  value  Bc2  which  depends  on  the  superconductor-material  &  its  temperature,    its  superconductivity 
disappears  altogether[4,5]  .  If  B  is  switched  off  to  zero  or  reduced  to  B  <  Bc1 
,  it  reverts  back  to 
superconducting-state.   If Bc1 < B < Bc2 it is in  mixed-state i.e., partially superconducting and partially  non-
superconducting [4,5] i.e., in-between superconductor & non-superconductor  meaning  partial-conductor.  
 

Thus if applied magnetic field B > Bc2 ,  the High-Tc Type-II-(b) Ceramic-Superconductor becomes 
non-super-conducting.  This  switch-over  phenomenon,  from  superconductor  to  non-superconducting  with 
application  critical  magnetic-field,  can  be  used  as    transistor-switch    for  current-flow  as  pass/no-pass  due  to 
material flipping as superconductor/non-superconducting. All superconductors including  High-Tc Type-II-(b) 
‘Ceramic-Superconductors’  can  work  as  good  ‘transistor-switch’    due  to  its  dual  material  characteristics    ‘of  
superconductor  as  well  as    of  non-superconducting’,    depending  on  its  conduction  state  of    high/low  as   
pass/no-pass or  1/0 .  The ceramic-superconductor, appears also to work as smart-material, is capable to sense 
the amount of applied magnetic-field B  through variations in its conductivity with the field (Bc1 < B < Bc2). 
 
 
(at T < Tc) with one-end as ‘Source’ &  the other-end as ‘Drain’ for electron-flow  and that if magnetic-field B 
is applied across it such that B > Bc2  then the superconductor will become non-superconducting.  As mentioned 
/ asked  about the ‘terminals’ and ‘this/that’ earlier in the last-paragraph of Introduction-section, it to say that       
if High-Tc Ceramic-Superconductor is used as junction-less Transistor then the 3 terminals are :  (i) one-end as 
S (Source),  (ii) other-end as D (Drain)  &  (iii) middle-region as G (Gate) for magnetic-field B   and ‘this/that’ 
combination  is  current-flow  ‘pass/no-pass’  due  to  ‘superconductor  becoming  non-superconducting’  with  the 
application of critical magnetic-field on Gate-region to control the current-flow.   
 

So  if  a  small  bare  wire  or  strip  or  rectangular-dot  of  this  High-Tc  Ceramic-Superconductor  is  taken     

Normally semi-conductor devices (e.g., switch) require an external-load (resistance) for voltage-drop, 
for the switch to work as inverter. The resistance of the superconductor (in non-superconducting state) can itself 
act as if  it is the load  in superconductor-devices (Cryotron & CST).  Interestingly, Logic Gates can be easily 
constructed with no-external-load, and considering  control signal  as  B   &  resulting voltage signal towards 
end-S  of  the  superconductor  as  V.    Taking  applied-voltage  (at  D)    VD  =  1  &  critical-magnetic-field  Bc2  =  1 
units, and considering  ‘presence / absence’ of the resulting  voltage as  high/low or ‘1 / 0’;  the result is that -      
if  B  =0,  V  =  1    and  else    if    B  =  1,  V  =  0  ;    the  proposed  ceramic-superconductor-transistor    thus  works  as 
‘inverter’ switch.  Logic Gates such as NAND or NOR can be built using two such load-less inverters  in series 
or in parallel respectively.  Further digital circuits can be logically built on combination of various Logic Gates.  

 
 
The ‘Ceramic-Superconductor Transistor’  is briefly named here as CST.  The CST seems to work well 
as far as ‘switching’ is concerned, and can well be used to build  digital circuits.  But using it for  input-signal 
‘amplification’, it apparently doesn’t  seem to work; because the control signal,  is not directly the small current 
at Base as in BJT or small voltage at Gate as in FET, which does amplification therein . Control-signal in CST 
is the small change (possibly due to small change of current or voltage at Gate) in magnetic field B which does 
not directly enter into the circuit; so it is not clear that how this control-signal, which is external & outside to 
the circuit,  can control or magnify/vary the input-signal of current or voltage  in the circuit. One suggestion to 
achieve the control of circuit-current through external magnetic-field B, is to vary B with the help of control-
signal at Gate to increase/decrease the total magnetic-field B in a range such that Bc1 < B < Bc2 ; i.e., keeping 
the  ceramic-superconductor  in  mixed-state  of  partially  superconducting  &  partially  non-superconducting; 
varying the conductivity with control-signal through changes in B within the mixed-region.  CST– electronics 
yet to be fully-developed   would be significantly different  and may open new avenues /applications. 
 
 
The symbol (as shown in Fig.1) of the new breed of transistor -  Ceramic Superconductor Transistor 
(CST)  is  suggested  as  follows  with  a  special  plus  sign.  The  vertical  thick-line  (S-D)  shows  the  ceramic-
superconductor;  it  is  made  thick  to  differentiate  from  the  thin  circuit-wires  (not  shown  in  the  figure)  to  be 
connected to S , D & G.  The horizontal dotted-line with an arrow  shows the control-signal  i.e., variable vector 
magnetic-field B; the line is dotted and only apparently-intersecting with the thick-line  because  in fact the field 
B is produced outside the circuit  but surrounds all-around over the superconductor and can change its property 
through control-signal at Gate.  It may be noted that  the CST itself  is  junction-less.

For comparison and clarity purpose, a tabular presentation is given as follows, which indicates that use 
of the ceramic-superconductor-transistor (CST) is almost  as viable & feasible as  other devices. It may be noted 
that materials for all  BJT, FET(MOS) & Qubit devices are semi-conductors [1-3] mostly diffusion-based with- 
junctions,  whereas for the last  three categories   the materials are superconductors [4,5].  But it may be noted 
that JJ is with-junctions whereas cryotron and CST are junction-less.  In fact, in a way, the proposed CST is a 
rebirth  of  forgotten-cryotron    but  now  with  high-Tc    ceramic-superconductor  and  with  new  design  & 
manufacturing.

Possible Difficulties,  Prospects, Implementation and Future  of  Ceramic-superconductor  as   
Junction-less   Printable Transistor 
 
 
Difficulties: 
 
 
The difficulties for it could be  (i) working at cryogenic temperature, (ii) limitations for micro or nano 
miniaturization, (iii) need for confinement of magnetic-field  etc.  Most of the existing nano-electronic-devices 
[9] have also to work at cryogenic temperature  and with easy availability of liquid nitrogen, it should not be 
much problem for this too. Micro & nano miniaturization is gradual process, can be achieved in due course with 
modern fabrication-technologies.  Confinement & implementation of magnetic-field for micro-devices could be 
a real big problem, but possibly with some shielding/focusing / scanning techniques with special  field-gun or 
with  some  novel  method  (as  suggested    under  the  heading:  Implementation)  it  could  be  made  possible  
eventually. 
 
 
Prospects: 
 
 
As mentioned above the difficulties do exist but could be overcome in due course;  on the other side 
the prospects for this new-breed of ceramic-superconductor are no less.  This proposed ceramic-superconductor 
device as transistor, does not have any junction at all  and neither have too much terminal connections & layers  
but, is just the bare superconductor wire/strip itself with external magnetic-field on it. So, whole device(s) can 
be printed on one-side of chip-board as printed-circuit with high-Tc type-II ceramic super-conducting material, 
a step forward in nano-technology based VLSI / GLSI.  Thus the chip made with ceramic-superconductor  can 
be more densely packed,  without any  impairment of devices due to overlapping of depletion-layer  & leakage 
etc. the usual undesirable features of compact semi-conductor devices, because there would be  no junction or 
depletion-layer  &  its  associative-defects  in  ceramic-superconductor-transistors      an  interesting    &  promising 
feature of the CST.   
 
 
Implementation: 
 
 
The  authors  suggest  a  novel  method  for  implementing  (applying)  magnetic  field  B  on  Gates(G)  by 
printing  superconducting  rings  (of  only  350o  ,    open  10o  for  current-connections)  on  the  reverse-side  of  the 
board    and  also  the  circuitry  to  pass  the  control-signal  (current)  through  these  rings  to  produce  the  magnetic 
field  to apply on.  On one-side of the chip-board are printed (i) the superconducting  nano-strips (one-end as 
Source-S & other-end as Drain-D); whereas on the other-side of the board are printed (ii) the superconducting 
rings (as Gate-G), with current-circuitry printed on both side with inter-connections if needed. It could also be 
possible to print/implement both-these i.e., (i) the superconducting strips & (ii) superconducting rings  on the 
same  side  of  the  chip  but  with  oxide  (SiO2)  layer  in-between,  somewhat  analogous  to  MOSFET  with  metal 
connections as required.  Alternatives to the usual-printing of all-these (IC) through the conventional deposition 
&  etching  /  photolithographic  techniques  are:    electron-beam  evaporation,  laser  ablation  techniques  etc.,  or 
could  be  combination  of    various  computer-controlled  fabrication/  manufacturing  techniques  for  electronic-
devices / computer-chips  [1-2, 11].   
 
 
Future: 
 

Famous physicist  Prof. Feynman once predicted that ‘there is plenty of room at the bottom’.  Another 
famous  physicist    Prof.  Michio  Kaku  predicts  technology-change  in  his  famous  book  ‘Visions’  [10]  that  
‘beyond  2020,  because  of  size-limit  of  silicon-chip  technology,  eventually  we  will  be  forced  to  invent  new 
technologies  whose  potentials  are  largely  unexplored  and  untested.  …Eventually,  the  reign  of  the  semi-
conductor microprocessors will end, and new types of quantum devices will take over’.  Professor Kaku  further 
adds that ‘in the computer industry, it takes roughly fifteen years, on the average, from conception of an idea to 
its entering into marketplace’.  He also expects ‘by 2020,  point one barrier ( .1 µ wavelength of ultraviolet light 

 

5 

for  photo-etching)  to  end’.    In  the  next  fifteen  years,  with  current  trends,  it  is  quite  likely  to  get  ceramic-
superconductor  at  room  temperature;  the  printable  (IC)  superconductor-devices  /  chips  may  then  (by  2020) 
replace  the  diffusion-based  semiconductor  devices.    Now  it  is  up  to    the  Scientists,  Engineers,  Institutions, 
Organizations, Laboratories and Industries to take-up the proposed-CST forward;  CST could be the transistor 
of the future ! 

Although CST, in principle, is a rebirth of cryotron  but there are several difference, stated as follows

Conclusions 
 
 
It seems possible to develop a new breed of transistor using high-Tc Type-II ceramic-superconductor 
(kept  at  T  <  Tc)  which  becomes  non-superconducting  if  a  certain  magnetic-field  (B  >  Bc2)  is  applied,  thus 
making current-flow from ‘pass’ state to ‘no-pass’ state. This new proposed transistor-device (CST) is supposed 
to  work  well    as    switching  device  without  any  junctions/layers,    flipping  to  condition  (achieved/  controlled)  
through  effective-change  in  external  magnetic-field.  It  can  also  work  for  other  purposes  of  transistor.    The 
proposed ceramic-superconductor-transistor (CST) can find new avenues & applications, but its theory is yet to 
be  fully-understood  &  developed    as  the  CST-electronics  would  be  quite  different;  for  CST  it  would  not  be 
simply  electronics  but  magneto-electronics  !    CST  would  be  load-less  and    junction-less  thus  diffusion-less   
printable-  transistor  controlled  by  magnetic-field.  Practicality  of  a  device  is  a  different  question    which  is 
usually resolved in due course of time;  but it appears that  the proposed CST, though speculative it may seem,  
at-least    works    in  principle.    The  revival  of  the  forgotten-cryotron  as  CST  seems  to  be  vital  for  nano-
electronics;  CST could be  the transistor  of  the future.

Abstract  :    We  use  the  effective  Hamiltonian  that  we  recently  fitted  against  the  first  306 

experimentally  observed  vibronic  transitions  of  NO2  [J.  Chem.  Phys.  119,  5923  (2003)]  to 
investigate the time domain nonadiabatic dynamics of this molecule on the coupled X2A1 and 
A2B2  electronic  states,  using  both  quantum  mechanical  and  quasiclassical  techniques.  From 

the  quantum  mechanical  point  of  view,  we  show  that  the  transfer  of  population  to  the 

electronic ground state originating from a wave packet launched on the excited state occurs in 

a stepwise fashion. The evolution of wave packets launched on the electronic ground state is 

instead  more  complex  because  the  crossing  seam  is  located  close  to  the  bottom  of  the 

electronic  excited  state.  We  next  use  the  mapping  formalism,  which  replaces  the  discrete 

electronic  degrees  of  freedom  by  continuous  ones,  to  obtain  a  classical  description  of  the 

coupled  electronic  states.  We  propagate  gaussian  swarms  of  trajectories  to  show  that  this 

approach can be used to calculate the populations in each electronic state. We finally propose 

a  very  simple  trajectory  surface  hopping  model,  which  assumes  that  trajectories  have  a 

constant probability to jump onto the other state in a particular region of the phase space and a 

null  hopping  probability  outside  from  this  region.  Quasiclassical  calculations  show  that  this 

model enables a precise estimation of complex quantities, like for example the projection of 

the instantaneous probability density on given planes.

I – Introduction 

Vibronic  interactions  between  different  electronic  potential  energy  surfaces  are  quite 

common in polyatomic molecules. If the electronic states are well separated in energy, they 

can be efficiently decoupled by applying the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and treating 

all the remaining small nonadiabatic effects within the framework of perturbation theory. As a 

result, the dynamics on the coupled surfaces is not very different from the dynamics on the 

isolated  surfaces.  In  contrast,  if  the  potential  energy  surfaces  come  close  together,  then  the 

Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down and new phenomena, like radiationless decay, 

unimolecular reactions, electron transfers, etc… , become possible. 

Triatomic  molecules  are  the  simplest  systems,  in  which  the  most  usual  nonadiabatic 

effects, like the Renner-Teller effect, conical intersections and intersystem-crossing vibronic 

couplings, can take place. Amongst them, the NO2 molecule has received particular attention, 

both from the experimental (see Refs. [1-4] and references therein) and theoretical (see Refs. 

[5-16] and references therein) points of view, so that it is now “the best known example where 

the effect of a conical intersection can be experimentally observed and calculated“ [3]. Most 

of these studies were however performed in the energy  domain because  they  were aimed at 

understanding  the  highly  dense  spectral  lines  in  the  optical  spectra.  The  unimolecular  time-

dependent dynamics of NO2 has been much less investigated [7,8,10,15]. In one of the first 

studies  performed  in  the  time  domain  [7],  it  was  found  that,  after  excitation  in  the  upper 

electronic adiabatic surface, the system decays very rapidly (within less than one vibrational 

period)  to  the  lower  adiabatic  state  and  then  moves  mainly  on  this  surface.  This  led  the 

authors to the conclusion that “the ground state nuclear dynamics can be understood without 

investigating higher electronic states” by using the adiabatic ground state surface. However, 

they  also  pointed  out  that  this  result  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the  coupling  strength  λ  was 

 

 

2 

assumed  to  be  very  strong  (λ=2250  cm-1)  and  that  different  regimes  can  be  generated  by 

varying λ. This remark is of fundamental importance, since it was shown more recently, on 

the  basis  of  the  comparison  between  experimental  and  calculated  photoelectron  spectra  of 

−

2NO   [9]  and  ab  initio  calculations  [10],  that  the  coupling  strength  is  most  certainly 

substantially  smaller  than  the  value  used  in  Ref.  [7].  Subsequent  studies  based  on  moderate 

values of the diabatic coupling (λ≈700 cm-1 in Ref. [10]) indeed displayed a less monotonous 

and richer behaviour of time-dependent quantities [10,15]. 

Still  more  recently,  we  derived  an  effective  model  for  the  X2A1-A2B2  conical 

intersection  of  NO2  [16]  by  fitting  its  30  parameters  against  the  energies  of  306 

experimentally observed levels up to 11800 cm-1 above the quantum mechanical ground state 

(there  is  only  one  missing  level  in  the  experimental  spectrum).  We  obtained  a  coupling 

strength  λ≈330  cm-1,  which  is  again  smaller  than  the  coupling  assumed  in  Refs.  [10,15], 

although still much too large to be handled perturbatively. The purpose of the present paper is 

to investigate the quantum mechanical time domain dynamics of this model and to propose a 

classical model for the nonadiabatic dynamics of NO2 close to the bottom of the X2A1-A2B2 

conical intersection. 

The  remainder  of  this  article  is  organized  as  follows.  The  effective  model  is  briefly 

described in Sect. II for the sake of completeness. Quantum mechanical results, obtained from 

the  “exact”  propagation  of  gaussian  wave  packets  are  presented  and  discussed  in  Sect.  III. 

These results are backed up in Sect. IV by the analysis of the dynamics of gaussian swarms of 

classical  trajectories  that  (i)  are  governed  by  a  classical  scalar  Hamiltonian  obtained  by 

mapping  the  discrete  electronic  degree  of  freedom  on  continuous  variables  [17-20],  or  (ii) 

evolve  on  decoupled  diabatic  electronic  states  and  have  a  given  probability  to  hop  onto  the 

other state in a certain region of the phase space.

II – The effective model 

The effective model used in this work is the one derived in Ref. [16], except that we 

henceforth  neglect  the  vibrational  resonance  in  the  electronic  ground  state.  Although 

experimentally  ascertained,  this  resonance  is  so  weak  that  the  average  error  in  computed 

energies  increases  only  by  a  small  fraction  of  a  cm-1  when  it  is  disregarded.  The  diabatic 

Hamiltonian of the coupled system is thus of the form

where 

gH  and 

eH  are the scalar Hamiltonians for the diabatic ground and excited states and 

cH   is  the  diabatic  coupling.  In  the  following  we  use,  in  agreement  with  standard 

spectroscopic notations, indexes 1 to 3 to label quantities related, respectively, to symmetric 

stretch,  bend  and  antisymmetric  stretch.  We  furthermore  denote  by

cH  on line positions is to a 

large  extent  similar  to  that  of  anharmonicities  inside  each  surface.  Therefore,  the  only 

information  on

(2.4) 

(2.5) 

Eq.  (2.4)  was  obtained,  by  using  standard  techniques  for  the  calculation  of  normal  mode 

coordinates,  from  (i)  the  firmly  established  equilibrium  geometry  in  the  electronic  ground 

state,  (ii)  the  more  indirectly  determined  geometry  in  the  electronic  excited  state  [4],  (iii) 

experimentally  determined  harmonic  frequencies,  and  (iv)  ab  initio  off-diagonal  quadratic 

force constants for X2A1 and A2B2 [23]. Note that the minimum of the electronic excited state, 

at about 10200 cm-1 above that of the ground state, is located very close to the crossing seam. 

This will play an important role in the propagation of wave packets. 

Since  λ  is  of  the  order  of  several  hundreds  of  cm-1,  the  diabatic  coupling  between 

harmonic vectors separated by several tens of thousands of cm-1 still has a sizable effect on 

the  energy  of  each  eigenstate.  We  therefore  proposed  in  Ref.  [16]  to  use  optimal  bases 

 

 

5 

obtained  from  perturbation  theory  in  order  to  reduce  strongly  the  size  of  the  Hamiltonian 

matrix and to speed up quantum mechanical calculations. This method was used to generate 

the set of converged eigenstates on which each wave packet was initially projected (see Sect. 

III).

III – Quantum mechanical description 

In this work, we did not try to mimic a precise experiment, in the sense that the initial 

wave packet was not chosen as the Franck-Condon excitation of the vibronic ground state. In 

order  to  get  a  more  general  understanding  of  the  time  domain  dynamics  on  the  coupled 

surfaces, we instead placed wave packets at several positions in the ground and excited states 

and let them evolve with time. These wave packets were assumed to be initially of minimum 

uncertainty  with  respect  to  the  normal  coordinates  of  the  diabatic  state  on  which  they  were 

launched. More explicitly, wave packet launched on the electronic excited state were of the

The remainder of this section is devoted to a discussion of the results obtained by the 

procedure  sketched  above.  Illustrations  will  focus  on  the  evolution  of  two  wave  packets, 

which are representative of all the results we obtained. The first one is initially placed with no

. In both cases, 

the energy at 

0=t

 of the center of the wave packet is comprised between 13000 and 13500 

cm-1 above the minimum of the electronic ground state. 

 

The  first  result,  illustrated  in  Fig.  1,  is  that  the  component  of  the  wave  packet  that 

remains  on  the  initial  electronic  state  essentially  follows,  at  least  for  the  first  tens  of 

femtoseconds,  the  trajectory  of  the  initial  center  of  the  wave  packet  on  the  decoupled 

electronic  state.  This  is  clearly  seen  in  Fig.  1,  which  shows  the  time  evolution  of  the

launched on

short times. The dephasing between the two sets of curves however increases almost linearly 

with time. This is due to the fact that the diabatic coupling induces anharmonicities in both 

electronic states [21,22]. Therefore, the frequencies experienced by the quantum mechanical 

wave  packet,  which  evolves  on  the  coupled  electronic  states,  are  slightly  but  noticeably 

different  from  the  frequencies  experienced  by  the  classical  trajectory,  which  evolves  on  the 

decoupled  ground  state.  Moreover,  the  spreading  of  the  quantum  wave  packet  and/or  the

The essentially classical behavior of the component of the wave packet that remains on 

the  initial  electronic  state  is  also  clearly  seen  in  Figs.  2  and  3.  These  figures  show  the 

projection of the probability densities on the  (

roughly  to  the  times  where  the  wave  packet  is  at  maximum  bending  deviation  in  the  initial 

surface,  but  the  Lissajou  curves  that  the  wave  packet  approximately  follows  in  the  initial 

surface are easy to imagine. 

 

The transitions from one electronic state to the other one, as well as the behavior of the 

wave packet on the initially unpopulated state, are less straightforward. A clear picture seems 

however to emerge when comparing the "trajectories" in Fig. 1 to the density probabilities in 

Figs. 2 and 3 and the population plots in Fig. 4. In this later figure, the solid lines represent the 

time  evolution  of  the  population 

  in  the  initial  electronic  state  for  the  wave  packet 

)(tPξ

launched on the electronic excited state (top plot) and the one launched on the ground state 

(bottom plot). It is seen that the transfer of density from the initially populated electronic state 

to  the  other  one  occurs  in  a  stepwise  fashion.  The  plateaux  are  flat  for  the  wave  packet 

launched on the electronic excited state, while they have an almost regular positive slope for 

the wave packet launched on the electronic ground state. Comparison of the various figures 

indicates that the sharp transfers of density take place when the initial wave packet is located 

in a region of the configuration space close to the crossing seam of the two diabatic states. As 

 

9 

long as the initial wave packet moves in this "intersection region", which will be characterized 

more precisely in Sect. IV, it transfers probability and energy to the other surface. After some 

femtoseconds,  the  initial  wave  packet  however  leaves  the  intersection  region  and  there  are 

henceforth two almost independent components, one on each electronic state. 

 

As is seen in Fig. 2 (vignettes at 

25=t

 fs), the two components emanating from the 

wave packet launched on the electronic excited surface then oscillate independently in their 

respective  wells.  No  density  is  transferred  during  this  round  trip,  which  corresponds  to  the 

first  plateau  in  the  top  plot  of  Fig.  4.  When  the  excited  state  component  comes  back  in  the 

intersection  region,  it  transfers  a  second  contribution  to  the  ground  state.  The  associated 

population decay in the excited state is reflected by the second sharp decrease in the top plot 

of  Fig.  4.  Of  course,  the  component  on  the  electronic  ground  state  simultaneously  transfers 

some probability to the excited state, but the relative populations at that time are such that this 

back-transfer is almost unnoticeable in the plots. The vignettes at 

45=t

 fs (Fig. 2) show that 

the  two  contributions  that  have  successively  been  transferred  to  the  electronic  ground  state 

interfere,  leading  to  clear  fringes  in  the  density  plot.  The  components  on  each  electronic 

surface then oscillate again (vignettes at 

70=t

 fs) and the whole process is repeated till the 

transfers in both directions equilibrate at around 180 fs (see the insert in the top plot of Fig. 

4).  Quite  satisfactorily,  the  results  illustrated  in  Fig.  2  and  in  the  top  plot  of  Fig.  4  are  in 

qualitative agreement with corresponding ab initio results (see Figs. 5 and 6 of Ref. [10]). 

 

Things are more complex for the wave packet launched on the electronic ground state. 

The reason is that the seam of the two electronic states, as well as the intersection region, are 

located very close to the bottom of the excited state. Therefore, the component on the excited 

state oscillates with very reduced amplitude and remains close to or in the intersection region. 

This  has  two  consequences.  First,  the  contributions  transferred  to  the  excited  state  interfere 

with  themselves  (see  the  vignette  at 

20=t

  fs  in  Fig.  3),  in  addition  to  interfering  with 

 

10 

contributions transferred at different times (see the vignettes at 

48=t

 and 

70=t

 fs in Fig. 3). 

Moreover,  since  the  excited  state  component  remains  localized  in  the  intersection  region,  it 

continuously transfers probability back to the electronic ground state. This is the reason why 

the  population  in  the  electronic  ground  state  slightly  but  regularly  increases  during  the 

plateaux : the ground state component oscillates outside from the intersection region (see the 

vignettes  at 

48=t

  and 

70=t

  fs)  and  is  thus  not  able  to  transfer  probability  to  the  excited 

state,  while  the  excited  state  component  remains  localized  in  the  intersection  region  and 

continuously transfers probability back to the ground state. 

 

This  later  conclusion  was  confirmed  by  calculations  where  wave  packets  were 

propagated  using  first  order  time  dependent  perturbation  theory.  This  indeed  led  to  very 

regular  steps  and  flat  plateaux  in  the  time  evolution  of  electronic  populations,  whatever  the 

state  on  which  the  wave  packet  was  initially  launched.  Since  first  order  perturbation  theory 

takes into account the transfer from the initial state to the other one, but not the transfer back 

to the initial state, this confirms that the positive slopes of the plateaux in the bottom plot of 

Fig. 4 are indeed due to the back transfers. 

The description of the time domain dynamics of NO2 close to the bottom of the X2A1-

A2B2 conical intersection, which is formulated above, will now be backed by the analysis of 

the dynamics of gaussian swarms of classical trajectories. 

IV - Quasiclassical description 

The correspondence of quantum and classical dynamics is an active field of research in 

molecular physics [24-30]. With this respect, the analysis of the dynamics on several coupled 

electronic  states  however  represents  a  more  complex  problem  than,  for  example,  the 

description  of  abrupt  changes  in  vibrational  wave  functions  in  terms  of  bifurcations  of  the 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

classical  periodic  orbits  [27,29,30],  because  the  electronic  degrees  of  freedom  have  no 

obvious  classical  analogue.  Two  approaches  have  traditionally  been  used  to  incorporate 

quantum degrees of freedom into a classical formulation. The first one, which was pioneered 

by  Landau  [31],  Zener  [32]  and  Stückelberg  [33],  incorporates  nonadiabatic  transitions 

between coupled electronic states through a surface-hopping procedure [34-36]. The second 

approach  is  instead  based  on  the  replacement  of  the  discrete  degrees  of  freedom  by 

continuous ones, either at the classical [37-42] or quantum mechanical [17-20,43,44] levels. 

The  description  obtained  from  the  quantum  mechanical  transformation  of  discrete  onto 

continuous degrees of freedom has been called the "mapping" approach by its authors. 

We  present  below  the  results  obtained  with  (i)  the  mapping  approach,  and  (ii)  a 

surface-hopping  approach  in  the  diabatic  representation  derived  from  the  mapping 

Hamiltonian. We start with the mapping approach, which is simpler to implement. 

According  to  Refs.  [17-20],  the  mapping  Hamiltonian  associated  with  the  quantum 

mechanical Hamiltonian of Eq. (2.1) can be written in the form

 are sets of conjugate "electronic" coordinates that describe the electronic 

ground  (

 and excited  (

 states. In order to get the quasiclassical equivalents of the 

electronic  state  populations 

  plotted  in  Fig.  4,  one  just  needs  to  propagate  classically

swarms  of  trajectories,  which  at  time 

0=t

  are  normally  distributed  (with

  variance) 

around the center of the quantum wave packet, and take the average of

 over 

all the trajectories. The results obtained with swarms of 2 104 trajectories are shown as dot-

dot-dot-dashed  lines  in  Fig.  4.  It  is  seen  that  the  classical  mapping  Hamiltonian  reproduces 

correctly the stepwise decrease of the electronic populations in the interval 0-180 fs. At longer 

 

 

 

12 

times, it slightly underestimates the excited state population for the wave packet launched on 

the excited state, but results are still qualitatively correct. 

 

However,  the  essential  drawback  of  the  mapping  approach  is  that  the  vibronic 

trajectories evolve on states that are linear combinations of the electronic ground and excited 

states  but  rarely  coincide  with  them.  Stated  in  other  words,

to completely meaningless results. Therefore, the standard mapping approach is not adapted 

to  the  quasiclassical  calculation  of  many  state-specific  quantities,  like  for  example  the 

probability  densities  shown  in  Figs.  2  and  3.  To  this  end,  we  could  have  implemented  the 

"decay of mixing" procedure in the mapping formalism (see Ref. [45] and references therein). 

We could also have adiabatized the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian of Eq. (2.1) to use, for 

example,  Tully's  fewest  switches  trajectory  surface-hopping  procedure  [34-36].  We  instead 

preferred to develop a somewhat different classical model, which we hope is particularly easy 

to grab. According to this model, which is based on the quantum mechanical observations in 

Sect. III, a given trajectory may hop onto the other electronic state only when it travels inside 

a certain region of the phase space called the "intersection region". The probability to jump 

onto the other state is constant inside the intersection region and null outside. The notion of 

"intersection region" could be given a theoretical foundation by analyzing in some more detail 

the  mapping  Hamiltonian  of  Eq.  (4.1).  Indeed,  by  introducing  the  action-angle  variables

We  could  have  considered  the  inequality  of  Eq.  (4.5)  as  the  definition  of  the  intersection 

region. However, to take into account the fact that the electronic phase needs not be exactly 

stationary  but  must  instead  just  evolve  slowly,  we  multiplied  the  numerical  prefactor  in  the 

right-hand side of Eq. (4.5) by approximately two and defined the intersection region as the 

region where the inequality

(4.6) 

holds.  At  last,  the  hopping  rates  need  only  be  adjusted  in  order  that  the  time  dependent 

populations  obtained  with  the  hopping  approach  match  those  obtained  with  the  mapping  or 

quantum  mechanical  ones.  Note  that  these  two  rates  govern  essentially  the  average  slope  at 

 

14 

short times as well as the equilibrium value at long times, but not the stepwise decay. Stated in 

other  words,  the  succession  of  steps  is  due  to  the  motion  of  the  wave  packets  inside  and 

outside  from  the  intersection  region  and  not  to  particular  values  of  the  hopping  rates.  Since 

quantum  mechanical  populations  were  available  and  our  principal  goal  was  to  validate  our 

description of the nonadiabatic dynamics in terms of the intersection region, we varied here 

the  two  rates  till  the  time  dependent  populations  obtained  with  the  hopping  model  were 

sufficiently close to the quantum mechanical ones in the 0-180 fs time interval. For the swarm 

launched  on  the  electronic  excited  state,  we  thus  used 

g →   and 
e

e →   hopping  rates  of 

g

0.38 and 0.20 fs-1, respectively, while for the swarm launched on the electronic ground state, 

we  used  rates  of  0.33  and  0.20  fs-1,  respectively.  Of  course,  these  quantities  depend  on  the 

exact  definition  of  the  intersection  region.  For  example,  if  it  were  defined  according  to  Eq. 

(4.5) instead of Eq. (4.6), then one should use rates larger by (approximately) a factor 2. 

 

The populations obtained with swarms of 2 104 trajectories are shown as dashed lines 

in Fig. 4. It is seen that they agree very well with quantum mechanical results in the interval 

0-180 fs, which indicates that the definition of the intersection region in Eq. (4.6) is judicious. 

The  result  is  particularly  impressive  for  the  swarm  launched  on  the  electronic  ground  state, 

since we initially had doubts concerning the ability of a classical procedure to mimic correctly 

the unceasing forth and back transfers between the two states. While still qualitatively correct, 

the agreement between quantum mechanical and hopping results is slightly less good at longer 

times  (t>180  fs),  but  this  is  essentially  due  to  the  fact  that  we  considered  only  the  0-180  fs 

interval for the adjustment of the hopping rates.

eH  and 

gH  are shown in Figs. 5 and 6, 

respectively.  These  figures  are  the  quasiclassical  equivalents  of  Figs.  2  and  3,  respectively. 

Except,  of  course,  for  interference  effects,  we  again  note  a  very  good  agreement  between 

 

 

15 

quantum mechanical and quasiclassical results, even for the swarm launched on the electronic 

ground state, for which the density transferred to the excited state oscillates in the intersection 

region. 

V - Conclusion 

We have presented a time-dependent dynamical study on the coupled X2A1 and A2B2 

electronic states of NO2, which is based on the effective Hamiltonian that we have recently 

fitted against the first 306 experimentally observed vibronic transitions of this molecule. We 

have  shown  that,  for  wave  packets  launched  on  the  electronic  excited  state,  the  transfer  of 

population  to  the  ground  state  occurs  in  a  stepwise  fashion.  The  evolution  of  wave  packets 

launched on the electronic ground state is instead more complex because the crossing seam is 

located  close  to  the  bottom  of  the  electronic  excited  state.  We  have  used  the  mapping 

formalism  to  obtain  a  classical  description  of  the  coupled  electronic  states  and  propagated 

gaussian swarms of trajectories to show that this approach can be used to calculate with good 

accuracy  the  populations  in  each  electronic  state.  We  have  finally  proposed  a  very  simple 

trajectory  surface  hopping  model,  which  nevertheless  reproduces  with  very  good  accuracy 

more  complex  quantities,  like  for  example  the  projection  of  the  instantaneous  probability 

density on given planes.

The Orientation of Local Spatial Reference

Frames in Quantum Teleportation

ABSTRACT

Quantum teleportation raises the question of the orientation of the local
spatial reference frames from which and to which teleportaton occurs.    Issues
related to this question are raised, and two possible explanations of these issues
are offered.  An empirical test to distinguish between them is  proposed  in  the
form of a gedankenexperiment.

TEXT

In the teleportation scheme proposed by Bennett  et  al.  [1],  a  quantum
state of a spin 1/2 particle X at one location can be teleported to another distant
location  where  another  spin  1/2  particle  Y  is  located.    An  experimental
realization following the basic idea of Bennett et al. has been accomplished [2].

Following  Bennett  et  al.  [1],  allow  that  in  a  gedankenexperiment  the
state to be teleported for a spin one-half particle X for the spin component along
the z axis is:

|y

X>  = a|›

X > + b|ﬂ

X >

(1)

After  teleportation,  perhaps  including  a  rotation  around  the  x,  y,  or  z  axes
where Y is  located  or  perhaps  allowing  for  an  unimportant  phase  factor,  the
state of Y should be the same as that which characterized X before teleportation:

|y

 Y>  = a|›

Y > + b|ﬂ

Y >

(2)

The following question arises: How  does one determine the orientation
of the x, y, or z axes at Y which is distant from X?  That is,  when an observer
obtains the classically communicated message regarding the nature of the Bell-
state measurement at X,  how does the observer at Y determine how the  local,
orthogonal  spatial  axes  are  located  within  which  a  rotation  can  be  made,  if
needed,  to  achieve  the  same  state  for  Y  that  characterized  X  before
teleportation?  What is the orientation frame within which these orthogonal axes
for an observer at Y are located?  Does one somehow  attempt  to  define  some
more  general  spatial  coordinate  frame  in  which  the  local  spatial  coordinate
frames  pertaining  to  X  and  Y  are  oriented?    Or  does  one  not  need  to  be

concerned about using a more general spatial reference frame with regard to the
relative orientations of the local spatial coordinate frames for X and Y?  In the
latter  case,  the  local  coordinate  frame  would  somehow  be  in  alignment  with
each  other  in  terms  of  local  factors.    What  these  factors  are  would  require
investigation.  

To determine whether a more general spatial reference frame is relevant
or whether the local spatial frames for X and Y are not located  within  a  more
general frame, our gedankenexperiment can be elaborated.  Consider a series of
experimental runs (1,2,3(cid:201))  where a number of particles X1,2,3(cid:201)  are  produced
in  the  exact  same  state  (with  the  same  wave  function  y)  and  teleported  to
Y1,2,3(cid:201).  Allow that X1,2,3(cid:201) is prepared in the state (1) above in a lab located at
one location on the earth(cid:213)s  surface.    Let  Y1,2,3(cid:201)  be  located  in  a  lab  such  that
X1,2,3(cid:201) and Y1,2,3(cid:201) are located at two  ends  of  the  earth(cid:213)s  diameter  and  Y1,2,3(cid:201)
takes on state (2) after quantum teleportation.  X1,2,3(cid:201) and Y1,2,3(cid:201) are at opposite
locations on the earth(cid:213)s surface.  How would an observer next to Y1,2,3(cid:201) set up
the lab so as to determine the z axis needed to interpret state (2) of Y1,2,3(cid:201)?  As
before, consider the case where the Bell state  measurement  at  Xa  and  another
particle yields a measurement indicating that state (1) is teleported with  only  a
phase change to Ya , - |y

 Y> = - (a|›

Y > + b|ﬂ

Y >) .

Allow further that the lab at X1,2,3(cid:201) is set so that the z  axis  for  X1,2,3(cid:201)
noted in state (1) is orthogonal to the earth(cid:213)s surface and that spin up along the z
axis indicates the direction pointing away from the earth(cid:213)s  surface.  In a similar
lab setup at Y1,2,3(cid:201)  where the z axis also points away from the earth(cid:213)s surface,
the spin up direction for Y1,2,3(cid:201) would be reversed.  They would be in opposite

directions when compared to a more general z axis that encompasses the local z
axes for the labs where X1,2,3(cid:201)  and Y1,2,3(cid:201) are located.  An example of a more
general  z  axis  is  depicted  in  Figure  1.    If  the  results  obtained  for  Y1,2,3(cid:201)
indicated  that  the  state  that  had  characterized  X1,2,3(cid:201)  before  teleportation  has
accurately teleported, then the data obtained in measurements on Y1,2,3(cid:201) would
have been  those  obtained  for  X1,2,3(cid:201)  had  they  been  made  and  the  thesis  that
there is only a local nature for an orientation frame within which the local spatial
coordinate frame is located would be supported (Table 1).  These are the results
predicted by Eqn. 2.  If, on the other hand, there is a more general spatial frame
within which the local ones for X1,2,3(cid:201) and Y1,2,3(cid:201) are located and which serves
to orient the local z axes for X1,2,3(cid:201) and Y1,2,3(cid:201). regardless of how the observers
set  up  their  local  spatial  frames,  the  results  obtained  for  Y1,2,3(cid:201)  would  be
different than those that would be obtained if the measurement had been made
on X1,2,3(cid:201) before teleportation.  An example of these results,  corresponding to
the example in Figure 1, is displayed in Table 2.  The results in Figure 2 are not
those predicted by Eqn. 2 for Y1,2,3(cid:201).

In more concrete terms, if for example a = 1/2 and b = (cid:214)(3/4), if a local
orientation frame is the only relevant frame, the percentage of  particles  Y1,2,3(cid:201)
with spin up is  |a|2 = 1/4 and spin down is |b|2 = 3/4.  If a more general spatial
frame with a z axis like that in Figure 1 is relevant to the local spatial coordinate
frames for X1,2,3(cid:201)  and Y1,2,3(cid:201) and takes precedence, the percentage of particles
Y1,2,3(cid:201)  with  spin  up  is  |b|2 =  3/4  and  spin  down  is  |a|2  =  1/4.    This  result
contradicts that expected by Eqn. 2.  It is difficult to imagine that there are any
influences  in  the  form  of  general  spatial  coordinate  frames  on  orientation  of
local spatial axes for X1,2,3(cid:201)  and Y1,2,3(cid:201).

The  most  general  circumstances  are  that  Y1,2,3(cid:201)  could  be  located  in  a
local spatial reference frame with any orientation relative to that  for X 1,2,3(cid:201).   As
Bennett et al. [1] noted:

Teleportation  has  the  advantage  of  still  being  possible  in
situations where Alice and Bob,  after  sharing  their  EPR  pairs,
have wandered  about  independently  and  no  longer  know  each
others(cid:213)  locations.    Alice  cannot  reliably  send  Bob  the  original
quantum particle, or a spin-exchanged version of it, if she does
not know where he is; but she can still teleport the quantum state
to  him,  by  broadcasting  the  classical  information  to  all  places
where he might be.

The general circumstances are the most  likely,  and  the  likelihood  of  a
more  general  spatial  coordinate  frame  relevant  to  the  local  frames,  that
supercedes them, is small.  If the hypothesis is supported that a general spatial
reference  frame  is  not  relevant,  then  psychological  factors  should  be
investigated  as  factors  in  the  local  orientation  frames  within  which  the  local
spatial axes are placed.  It has been shown that psychological factors are central
to  an  individual(cid:213)s  sense  of  the  upright  that  would  form  the  basis  for  the
observer(cid:213)s personal  spatial  structure  [e.g.,  3,4,5,6,7,8].    It  may  be  that  this
personal  spatial  structure  of  the  observer  serves  as  the  basis  for  the  local
orientation  frame  within  which  the  spatial  coordinate  frame  used  to  measure
either X or Y locally if a more general spatial coordinate frame is not applicable.
The possibility that the personal spatial structure of the  observer  is  significant
can be subjected to empirical test.

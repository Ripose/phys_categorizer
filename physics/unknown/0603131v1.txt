After a brief introduction to the NIST EBIT facility, we present the results of threedifferent types of experiments that have been carried out there recently:  EUV and visiblespectroscopy in support of the microelectronics industry, laboratory astrophysics using an x-raymicrocalorimeter, and charge exchange studies using extracted beams of highly charged ions.THE NIST EBIT FACILITY: HISTORY AND OVERVIEWElectron Beam Ion Traps (EBITs) emerged on the world scene in 1988 with thepublication of the first results by the Livermore-LBL collaboration [1].  Results thatdepended critically on high-resolution x-ray spectroscopy with an EBIT appeared inthe Physical Review in 1989 [2], using an NRL-NIST spectrometer at Livermore, incollaboration with P. Beiersdorfer.  This work followed some other important EBIThigh-resolution spectroscopy work presented earlier in various conferenceproceedings.  Two years later, construction of a new EBIT laboratory at NIST began,in collaboration with NRL, and two years after that (1993) we began trapping ions andpublishing papers from the NIST facility.  A compilation of the early Livermore EBITpapers was published in 1992 [3].  Recently, we published a bound collection of theNIST EBIT publications through 2001, which is available in hardcopy and CD fromNIST [4].  The NIST compilation also contains some previously unpublishedhistorical information about both the NIST and LLNL EBITs (written by the firstauthor of the present paper, and by Ross Marrs of LLNL).The NIST EBIT incorporates a number of design changes that are intended to allowit to reach higher beam energies than those obtained in the EBIT-I and EBIT-II atLLNL.  The upper energy limit of the NIST machine has not yet been tested, althoughit has been run as high as 33 keV as well as below 100 eV.  We have produced chargestates as high  q=73+  in bismuth ions, and at 33 keV should be able to produce strongspectra from any Ne-like ion on the periodic table.  The drift tube structure is notexpected to hold more than 40 keV, but the upper range of the beam energy mightexceed 50 keV if the electron gun and cathode are floated to negative high voltages, asthey are in the LLNL SuperEBIT [5].  The NIST EBIT electron gun and collector reston small internal high voltage platforms to enable this mode of operation, althoughthere has been so much physics to explore below 30 keV to date that the platformshave only been run at ground potentials.  For reference, we note that 33 keV is equalto the threshold energy needed to produce He-like U90+ ions, although we would notexpect to produce many such ions near threshold, and have not tried to do so.  ASuperEBIT of the sort available at LLNL [5], Tokyo [6], or Heidelberg [7], withenergies near 200 keV, is necessary in order to produce significant quantities of thehighest few percent of all the possible charge states on the periodic table.The NIST EBIT facility is also equipped with an ion-extraction beamline for ion-solid and ion-gas collision studies.  The general technique of extracting ions from anEBIT was pioneered at Livermore [8], but the design of the NIST beamline resulted inon-target beam currents of Xe44+ ions that were 100 times higher than previouslyreported from an EBIT (1000x times higher in continuous beam mode) [9].  Thissubstantial improvement (reaching 10’s of pA) enabled new classes of experimentswith highly charged ion beams (see, e.g., the section on charge exchange below).EUV AND VISIBLE SPECTROSCOPY OF XENONIn support of the development of EUV Lithography (EUVL) [10] light sources forthe microelectronics industry, we have produced benchmark EUV spectra of Xe ionsfor testing plasma models.  Xe charge states around q=10+ emit strongly around 13.5nm wavelength, where highly efficient multilayer optics have been developed forlithography applications.  The lines in this region of the spectrum appear denselypacked, even when observed with the world’s largest (10.7 m) grazing incidencespectrometer, located at NIST [11].  To study the intensity envelope of this group oflines (as well as the even stronger group around 11 nm) with the NIST EBIT, we haveconstructed an ultrahigh vacuum EUV spectrometer, based on a variable line space(VLS) flat-field grating.  Figure 1 shows an example of one of our early  EUV spectra.FIGURE 1.  EUV spectrum of Xe taken at 1.5 keV electron beam energy.To complement these EUV studies, we have also observed Xe in the x-ray and, asshown in figure 2, the visible region of the spectrum.  The two lines marked on the leftside of this spectrum demonstrate the improvement in our spectroscopy system sinceour 1995 publication that reported the first visible/uv spectroscopy on an EBIT [12].In comparison to figure 1 of our earlier work [12], we can now obtain spectra withmuch higher resolution, much higher signal-to-noise ratio, and much broader spectralrange, in a fraction of the time.We note that the strongest line in figure 2 (near 598 nm) is particularly interestingin that it arises from the charge state q=9+ that is adjacent to the q=10+ charge statethat future EUVL systems might be based on in the microelectronics industry.  Wepropose that this line might be useful for real-time diagnostics of EUVL light sources.For completeness, we note that the Livermore EBIT group has previously reporteda line that is essentially at the same wavelength as the one we measure at 598 nm, butwhich they identify as arising from a much higher charge state (q=31+) [13].  We havetried to search for a possible coincidental line overlap by scanning the electron beamenergy and looking for a slight shift in measured wavelength or intensity, but we havefound no evidence for the existence of two lines at this location.  The line positionreported by the LLNL group is at 598.40(100) nm and is identified to be from a 3d54G9/2- 4G11/2  transition in Xe31+, while our observed line position is at 597.98(50) nmand arises from the 4d9 2D3/2- 2D5/2 transition in Xe9+.  We can be certain that the linewe see does not arise from q=31+ because it remains strong at 500 eV beam energy(fig 3a), nearly a factor of 4 below the 1.8 keV energy needed to produce Xe31+.Further evidence supporting our identification of the charge state is provided by thefact that the line disappears when the beam energy is dropped below the 180 eVenergy needed to produce Xe9+ (fig. 3b).  These measurements illustrate the power ofan EBIT, when put to full use, to aid in the definitive identification of spectral lines.FIGURE 2.

The present era hasbeen likened to the early days of optical spectroscopy, when spectral lines visible tothe eye were just being highly resolved for the first time.  Future generations of x-rayobservatories are being planned that will use new types of high-resolutionspectrometers that are based on photon calorimetry rather than diffraction from agrating or crystal.  Shortly before the launch of Chandra and XMM Newton, theHarvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (Harvard-SAO) began acollaboration with us to test the development of x-ray microcalorimeters, and todeploy them for laboratory astrophysics using the NIST EBIT to simulate the hotplasmas that were soon to be studied by the orbiting observatories.  The particularmicrocalorimeters and associated electronics deployed at NIST were built entirely atHarvard-SAO and Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in recent years (except forcommercial dewars) and have not been deployed previously at other EBIT facilities.Since the publication of our initial results on the astrophysically relevant Fe XVIIspectrum [14], the Livermore EBIT group has also published some FeXVII resultsusing a NASA-GSFC microcalorimeter [15].  The experimental results havestimulated significant theoretical activity, including that of Chen and Pradhan [16]who have carried out what is described as possibly the largest electron-ion scatteringcalculation to date (a relativistic close-coupling calculation with Hamiltonian matrixdimension up to 10,286).  Prior to this calculation, the astrophysical observations werenot comfortably reconcilable with either theory or our measurements (although someof the astrophysical line ratios did agree with the later results from the LivermoreEBIT group [15]).  The new calculations, however, show strong resonances along theenergy axis and suggest that our measurements are actually the ones in betteragreement with both theory and astrophysical observations, once theenergy/temperature dependence is taken into account (figure 2 of reference [16]).Independent of the astrophysical observations, we can say that while some of the lineratios measured in the LLNL experiment are in relatively good agreement with ourresults, other ratios disagree at the 2-sigma to 3-sigma level.  We are presently startinga new set of measurements to investigate the significance of this discrepancy further,as well as to study other spectra of interest.Recently, both the LLNL and the NIST EBIT groups have deployed new (2ndgeneration) microcalorimeters in their labs.  At the present conference, the LLNLgroup emphasized the performance improvements in their new microcalorimeter, ascompared to our old instrument, so we point out here the corresponding improvementsin our instrument as well.  During a recent set of first measurements on the NISTEBIT, our new microcalorimeter obtained a resolution improved slightly from 6 eV[17] to 5.5 eV (3.0 eV at 6 keV photon energy has been obtained under more optimalconditions at SAO).  The microcalorimeter at LLNL has improved from 11.5 eV to 6.5eV (at a photon energy of 6.7 eV, a temperature of 60 mk, and for 14 summed pixels[18]).  The total number of active pixels is 32 at LLNL [18] and 4 at NIST.  Some ofthe early measurements at NIST used an x-ray lens that boosted the light intensity perpixel by up to a factor of 100 [19], rather than using more pixels to collect thenaturally distributed light.  The maximum count rate/pixel is limited by the pulsedecay time, which is 1 ms in both instruments used at NIST, and has improved to 3 msin the new instrument used at LLNL [20].  The pixel size is 0.624x0.624 mm2 atLLNL [20] and 0.4x0.4 mm2 at NIST.  Our “hold time” (amount of time that it can berun continuously, before having to shut down and refresh the adiabaticdemagnetization refrigerator), has improved from 10 hours to >24 hours, while theLLNL hold time has improved from 5 hours to >12 hours [18].  Because of the apparent discrepancy between the NIST and the LLNL Fe XVIImeasurements, a number of remarks have been published [15] by the LLNL group thatrequire clarification.  The most substantive ones are discussed below (this discussionis by the first author of the present paper, and should not necessarily be attributed toall of the other coauthors, only some of whom participated in the relevantexperiments).Contrary to the claim that the NIST EBIT suffers "performance limitations" andwill not operate below 700 eV [15], figure 3 above demonstrates that it indeedoperates quite well at energies as low at 100 eV.  In fact, the NIST EBIT has operatedsignificantly below 100 eV since the first time it was attempted, in January 2000.  Likeall EBITs (including the LLNL EBIT [18]), however, ours does show an increase insnout/anode current when operated at low beam energies [21].  This is typicallycompensated for by lowering the beam current.It has been suggested [15] that the NIST EBIT operates at higher beamtemperatures than the LLNL EBIT.  There are two possible meanings of “beamtemperature”:  (1)  overall beam temperature, or full energy spread, and (b) transversebeam temperature.  Regarding the first, the paper cited by LLNL in [15] concerningthis issue determined their beam temperature to be 50 eV [22],  larger than the 45 eVvalue determined previously for the NIST EBIT  [23].  The actual value for the NISTEBIT during the  Fe XVII experiment is likely to have been even less since weoperated at reduced beam currents (one component of the temperature is proportionalto the space charge, which scales linearly with beam current).Regarding the second type of beam temperature,  the relevant paper [24] referencedby the LLNL group in [15] quotes us [21] as saying that 700 eV is our estimate for thetransverse beam temperature of the NIST EBIT, whereas in fact we only proposed thatthis was an upper bound.  The LLNL group [24] specifies their own transverse beamtemperature to be 190(30) eV (revised upwards from their earlier estimate of 110 eV[25]), reported to be in agreement with a theoretical prediction of 194 eV.  Theirtheoretical prediction, however, is based on an imprecise value for one of the criticalconstants in the theory (the beam radius at the cathode).  When the actual value [21,26] for this constant is used, the theoretical prediction increases to 440 eV.Furthermore, the LLNL group obtained their experimental value of 190 eV from a setof determinations that ranged from –35 eV to +1920 eV (nearly 3 times our upperbound).  They discarded half of these results, “even if the residuals intimate anexcellent fit” [24], and averaged the remaining 6 points, even though these remainingpoints still showed a wide scatter (spanning 6-sigma of the final quoted uncertainty).It is clear from the details of their analysis that the spread in the 6 determinations isdue primarily to a non-random systematic error arising from an improper form of thefitting function.  It is therefore inappropriate that they quoted an uncertainty reducedbelow the standard deviation by the square root of the number of determinations [27].If they had not discarded half of their determinations, they would have arrived at amean value of 566 eV, in good agreement with the corrected theoretical prediction andmuch closer to our upper bound.It has been claimed that the NIST EBIT does not operate under collisionalequilibrium (citing evidence that Fe XVII lines do not appear in the LLNLmeasurements beyond 1.5 keV, whereas they do appear in the NIST measurements atthese energies) [15].  The rapid approach to collisional equilibrium (<15 ms) has beendemonstrated in figure 3 of our earlier work [28], for a range of charge states of Kr,from q=1 to q=22.  In our Fe XVII experiment, the trapping time was 1.0 s [29],significantly longer than the time needed to reach collisional equilibrium in thatsystem.  The fact that Fe XVII lines do not appear in the LLNL measurements forbeam energies beyond 1.5 keV can be easily explained by the lack of ion cooling gasin their experiment.  Using an EBIT simulation code developed at LLNL [30], wehave modeled the cases of no cooling gas, P<5x10-11 hPa (torr), and moderate amountsof cooling gas, P=5x10-9 hPa (torr), and found that in the former case theconcentration of Fe XVII is reduced to zero above 1.5 keV, while in the latter case it isonly rapidly reduced to a local minimum (still far above zero) around 4 keV, and thengrows modestly up to (and beyond) 10 keV.  We conclude that the difference inobserved behavior between the LLNL and NIST EBIT is the normal result of chargeexchange from the cooling gas, and does not imply a lack of collisional equilibrium ineither one of the devices.It was claimed in [15] that an earlier LLNL paper [31] proved that a substantialfraction of Fe XVI contaminated the NIST 3C/3D line ratio.  In fact, the LLNL paper[31] showed only that Fe XVI contaminated some of their own work, not the NISTwork.  The only way the LLNL group was able to obtain significant contamination intheir spectra was to continuously inject neutral Fe in a gaseous form.  When they usedpulsed MEVVA ion injection (as we did at NIST) the contamination was negligible.As pointed out by Chen and Pradhan [16], both the published LLNL and the NIST3C/3D ratios are in good agreement with each other (and with theory) once the energydependence is taken into account (at least at the energies calculated with resonances).It was correctly pointed out [15] that the NIST Fe XVII data was not time-resolved.Indeed, we summed and reported every photon emitted during the normal course ofthe experiment.  Although not described explicitly in their paper [15], the LLNL groupdiscarded photons that were detected in the period just after iron injection, andanalyzed only those that were detected after a certain delay time [18].  Although thedifference is significant in principle, in practice it will not affect the final results muchif the trapping time is long compared to the time to reach collisional equilibrium.It was pointed out that our "calorimeter response was not calibrated or monitoredin-situ" [15].  The response of our calorimeter was determined initially (includingwindow transmission) and observed to be stable during the experiment.  Because ofthe high overall stability, the much smaller differential changes in the response curvebetween nearby wavelengths should be entirely negligible.  As calculated in our paper[14], it would take a huge window contamination layer, equal to twice our windowthickness itself in the case calculated, to shift our most sensitive line ratios outside ofour quoted error bars.  We believe this is very unlikely.Finally, we note a significant difference in the adjustment (or lack thereof) of theline ratios that were actually observed in the NIST and LLNL EBITs—a differencepreviously unappreciated by the LLNL group that appears to have led them to anincorrect comparison of one set of results to another in their figure 2 [15] and in theirinvited talk at the present conference [18].  As described in our papers, we report lineratios that are “as observed” (i.e. from a real EBIT under specified conditions)—thereare no adjustments based on theory.  The LLNL group, in contrast, adjusts theirobserved values (using theory) to obtain results that would have been observed if theirEBIT were more similar to some astrophysical sources (for example, not having anelectron beam that is unidirectional and oriented 90-degrees to the observation vector).In our view, such adjustments should be a part of the theory that explains theexperimental data, not the other way around (compare our figure 3 [14], which showsthe effect of the anisotropic emission in the theory, for a range of allowed possibilities,rather than as a fixed offset in the experiment).  Once the two sets of data are plottedon equal footing, the apparent discrepancy is significantly reduced.CHARGE EXCHANGE STUDIESWith the surprising discovery  of the emission of x-rays (typically corresponding tovery high temperatures) from comets ("dirty snowballs"), and the subsequentexplanation of this effect in terms of charge exchange with the solar wind, studiesrelated to the capture of electrons from gasses by highly charged ions have becomepopular (for a review, see [32]).  The LLNL EBIT was deployed to address thecometary x-ray problem using a technique in which the electron beam is switched offand low-level x-ray emission is observed to persist from the magnetically trapped ionsdue to charge exchange with the background gas inside the EBIT [33].  Motivated notonly by the cometary x-ray problem, but also by the need for a better understanding ofcharge exchange processes in research involving controlled thermonuclear fusion andEUV lithography, we have been engaged in charge exchange studies using acomplementary technique, since the year 2000.  In our experiments [34-35], the rangeof charge states present in the EBIT are extracted and passed through a q/m selectingmagnet, and then directed through an aperture into a differentially pumped chamberwhich contains a gas jet target.  We observe the x rays emitted from the interaction ofthe ion beam with the jet, using a high purity Ge detector.  This method is alsocomplementary to the LLNL method in that ours involves collision velocities thattypically are much higher (well-matched to those in the solar wind), although we canalso adjust our beams to span the range of velocities from above 800 km/s to below 30km/s.  The velocity dependence of the measured and calculated "x-ray hardnessfactor" has been presented in figure 33 of a recent review article by Beiersdorfer [36].Our results for Ne projectiles that are fully stripped before electron capture agree wellwith the experiment of Greenwood, et. al [37] shown in that plot [36].In order to learn more about the details of the capture process, one can look at thefull spectral signature of the x-ray emission.  In figure 4, we show this for the case ofAr projectiles, now adding some complexity to the problem by leaving one electron onthe projectile (before electron capture and emission in the He-like state).We have been working with several sets of theorists to model this spectrum andgain insight into the quantum state-specific (n, l) initial capture distribution.  Theresult of several single-electron capture distributions calculated for our argonprojectiles with the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (CTMC) method, following[38], and a version of the Landau-Zener (MCLZ) method, following [39], are shownin figure 5 (both include capture only from the Ar 3p shell).  These distributions areused as input to a separate calculation, following [40], of the photon emission thatoccurs as the excited  ion cascades to the ground state.  The final results is shown inthe curves plotted in figure 4.  The discrepancy with the LZ model at the highest x-rayenergies might be due to the neglect of multiple electron capture, anisotropic emission(polarization effects), or variation in the triplet-singlet population ratio (among otherpossibilities).  We are currently engaged in a dynamic interplay between experimentand theory in attempt to reduce the disagreements and improve the understanding ofthe underlying physical processes in these and the other studies described in thispaper.A variety of other experiments are under way at the NIST EBIT facility, includingcontinued studies in the area of ion-surface interactions [41] and precisionmeasurements of the effect of the quantum vacuum on atomic structure [42].FIGURE 4.

ABSTRACT

The near universal references to the above paper by most of the major US media

outlets and blogs since Katrina and Rita made US landfall requires a response

from a few of us who study hurricanes.   Having been involved with hurricane

research and forecasting for nearly 50 years, I feel I have an obligation to offer

comments on this paper’s findings which, in my view, are not valid.

This paper concludes that global tropical cyclone net power dissipation [(or

friction times wind) - taken to be proportional to the sum of each cyclone’s

individual 6-hour track period maximum wind speed cubed (~ Vmax

3)] has

undergone large (more than doubled) increases over the last 30 years. The author

associates these frictional energy dissipation increases with rising mean sea

surface temperatures (SSTs) and implies that these SST increases may, in part,

be related to human activity.  If true, this is a very important finding that has great

relevance as regards to the globe’s future climate and future hurricane

1

destruction.  But, the author’s ‘apparent’ blockbuster results and his

interpretation of his calculations are not realistic.

DISCUSSION

This paper’s conclusions are partially based on an analysis of poorly documented and

biased tropical cyclone (TC) maximum wind (Vmax) data from the Northwest (NW)

Pacific.   This study presents a sum of each tropical cyclone’s maximum winds - a very

hard measurement to realistically obtain over a 3-5 decade period of changing

maximum wind measurement techniques.  The author then cubes these maximum wind

3) of questionable accuracy.  Such a cubing process greatly exaggerates
speeds (Vmax
any errors in the original Vmax estimate.   For instance, a TC with a 40 ms-1 maximum

wind speed and a plus/minus 10% margin of error (44 m/s versus 36 m/s) in Vmax wind

leads to a 80 percent high vs. low difference in Vmax

3.

DETERMINATION OF HURRICANE MAXIMUM INTENSITY

There always has been, and there probably always will be, problems in assigning a

representative maximum surface wind to a hurricane.  As technology advanced from
conditions during the mid-20th century to the present, the methods of determining a

hurricane’s maximum winds underwent change.  These changes have introduced

difficulties in realistically comparing long period tropical cyclone maximum wind records.

With the availability of new aircraft-deployed inertial dropwindsondes and the new step-

frequency surface wind measurement instruments, it is being found that sustained

surface winds in a hurricane are often stronger than previously estimated.  The

correction factor for maximum wind values extrapolated downward from aircraft altitude

has changed in the Atlantic (Franklin et al. 2003).  Atlantic hurricane category numbers

have and likely will continue to undergo upward increases due to the continuing

improvement of technology.  Technology corrections will have to be made when Vmax

2

comparisons are made of long period records.  Similar but different technical correction

needs are required in the Northwest (NW) Pacific.

The author has utilized the official best track NW Pacific tropical cyclone (TC) Vmax

values over the last 50 years.  He has made corrections to some of the Vmax values and

has accepted others as realistic.   His analysis has many problems.  It is known that

there are long-period systematic biases in the NW Pacific maximum wind (Vmax) values

because of the methodological changes in how the NW Pacific maximum wind

estimates have been made.  The author tried to account for these measurement

technique differences, but his method of doing so was wrong.  It was his faulty

corrections for the long term biases in the NW Pacific data set which led to his invalid

calculations that TC energy dissipation had shown large increases in recent years.

Prior to 1973, maximum winds (Vmax) in the NW Pacific could not be reliably measured.

They were estimated from aircraft central pressure and flight crew visual estimations of

wave-spray characteristics.  Crews had a tendency to exaggerate their maximum wind

estimates.  A guideline to determining maximum winds (Vmax) from measured central

pressure in general use at the Joint-Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) until the early
1970s was  Vmax = 16(1010 –Pc) 0.5, where Pc is central pressure in millibars and Vmax is

maximum wind in knots.

To correct what appeared, at the time to be overestimations of Vmax, Atkinson and

Holliday (1977), while engaged in forecasting duties at JTWC, devised a new maximum

wind-central pressure relationship scheme which was used as a guide for later Vmax

determination.  This wind-pressure relationship was applied between 1973-1986.  This
new formula specified Vmax = 6.7 (1010 – Pc)0.644.  These newer Atkinson-Holliday (AH)

estimates gave central pressure-determined maximum wind values which are now

known to be too low.  For a typhoon with a MSLP of 950 mb, the Vmax difference by

these two techniques is 32 percent lower with the Atkinson-Holliday (AH) scheme than
3 with the

the pre-1973 scheme.  This would lead to a 232 percent higher value of Vmax

earlier pre-1973 method than with the later (1973-86) AH method.

3

The AH scheme substantially underestimated Vmax for all typhoons.  This resulted in a

significant underestimate of Northwest Pacific cyclone Vmax values between 1973-1986.

For instance, in the 6-year period prior to 1973 the average seasonal number of

typhoons with maximum winds above 100 and 130 knots was over twice as much as

during the average 6-year period of 1973-1978.  The average annual number of super

typhoons in the West Pacific between 1950-1972 and 1987-2004 was 5.3 and 4.9.  In

the AH period of 1973-86, it was only 2.3.  Yet West Pacific typhoon activity in the 1973-

86 periods showed no apparent differences from earlier or later period activity.  The AH

scheme was discontinued after 1986 when aircraft reconnaissance in the NW Pacific

was terminated, and central pressures could no longer be directly measured.   Vmax

values have since been obtained solely from satellite.  The Dvorak satellite TC intensity

scheme (1975, 1984) is known to give systematic higher Vmax estimates than the AH

scheme.   Knaff and Zehr’s (2005) recent analysis shows that the Dvorak satellite

(1975, 1984) scheme for the estimation of Vmax (used in the Pacific since 1987) gives,

on average, about 7.5 m/s higher Vmax value than the AH scheme for all wind speed

categories.   There is no question that the Dvorak scheme is superior to the AH

scheme.  The differences between the Dvorak and the AH schemes causes large

differences in Vmax

3.  For 7.5 m/s wind differences of 32.5 m/s for Dvorak versus 25 m/s

for AH, the cubed ratio of the Dvorak to the AH maximum wind speed is 2.2.  For higher

Vmax values (say 57.5 vs. 50 m/s) this ratio is 1.5.  There are many more TC time

periods in Emanuel’s analysis of the lower Vmax values when this ratio of the cubed Vmax

of the satellite to the AH is close to 2 to 1.

Most of the large increase in Emanuel’s NW Pacific TC energy dissipation calculations

from the early 1970s to the early 2000s can be explained by the cubed differences of

the Vmax estimates between the more recent (since 1987) Dvorak pure satellite scheme

for Vmax and the earlier (1973-1986) period when the AH aircraft scheme was used.

Gray et al. (1991) and Martin and Gray (1993) have discussed the many complications

that arise for Vmax determination from utilization of satellite-only versus aircraft-only

measurements and when both measurements are available.

The rest of Emanuel’s last 30-year increase in NW Pacific tropical cyclone frictional

energy dissipation can be explained by a variety of other decadal changes unique to the

NW Pacific including increased El Niño activity in recent decades.  Northwest Pacific

tropical cyclones form further eastward in El Niño years and have longer over-ocean

tracks.  El Niño activity has been more frequent during the last three decades.  When El

Niño activity is reduced in future years, NW Pacific track length will likely be reduced as

will Emanuel’s Power Dissipation Index (PDI).

Another major problem with Emanuel’s results is his assumption that a measurement of

Vmax is directly related to the net frictional energy dissipation of the cyclone’s entire

broad scale circulation.  A cyclone’s outer radius area is vastly larger than its inner core

of high wind speed and can bring about more net wind energy dissipation than the
3 for an estimation of TC net broad scale energy

inner-core.  Emanuel’s use of Vmax

dissipation is not a satisfactory assumption.

Merrill (1982) and Cocks and Gray (2002) found that a cyclone’s size (as measured by

the outer closed isobar or by the mean radius of 15 or 25 m/s winds) is a much better

representation of the cyclone’s net tangential momentum than its inner core intensity

expressed by Vmax.  Many years of studying a tropical cyclone’s net area of cyclonic

wind (as determined by its mean outer closed isobar) and relating it to its Vmax in both

the NW Pacific and the Atlantic showed that these two factors were correlated at about

0.3, explaining only about 10 percent of the variance between Vmax and the cyclone’s

outer area of tangential wind.  There are also life cycle differences in tropical cyclones.

As cyclones intensify (in their early stages) their ratio of Vmax to outer wind strength ratio

is significantly higher than when they are filling at higher latitudes (Weatherford and

Gray I and II, 1987).

In the Atlantic, Vmax has been more reliably measured with aircraft.  But increases in

Vmax

3 and longer cyclone tracks have occurred only in the last 11 years (1995-2005) and

not over the last 30 years as this study implies.   Most of Emanuel’s 30-year increase in

5

wind energy dissipation occurs only from the combination of the Atlantic and Pacific

data sets where the Pacific has nearly three times as many tropical cyclones as the

Atlantic.

There was a lower Atlantic net Vmax

3 between 1975 and 1994, at a time that global

SST’s were rising.   Much higher Vmax

3 values occurred in the 1950s and 1960s when

global mean SST values were undergoing a modest decrease.  It is only in the last

decade that there have been increases in Atlantic Vmax and track length.  The last-

decade Atlantic increases in hurricane activity can be directly associated with the large

increase in the strength of the Atlantic Ocean Thermohaline circulation (THC) – the so

called positive phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation (AMO).  Multi-decadal

variations in Atlantic sea surface temperatures, associated with multi-decadal

oscillations in Atlantic hurricane activity, have also been documented in Greenland ice-

core temperature records going back thousands of years.  The increase in Vmax in the

Atlantic over the last decade (1995-2005) should terminate when the thermohaline

circulation (THC) weakens in the coming decades.   Atlantic net TC frictional energy

wind dissipation will then be reduced.

VARIATION IN MAJOR HURRICANE NUMBERS DURING THE LAST TWO

DECADES OF GLOBAL WARMING

The NCEP/NCAR reanalysis of global mean surface temperature and global SSTs

shows a rise in temperature over the last 10 years in comparison with the mean global

surface temperature and SST of the prior 10 years of 1985-1994.  Between 1995-2004,
average global surface temperatures have been observed to be about 0.4oC higher than

the earlier 10-year period of 1985-1994.  Table 1 shows the number of observed major

hurricanes (Cat. 3-4-5) around the globe (excluding the Atlantic) between these two 10-

year periods.  Major hurricane activity has not gone up in the more recent 10-year

period when global surface temperatures have been higher.  Even when the large

increase in Atlantic major hurricane activity is added to the non-Atlantic total of major

6

hurricanes, there is no significant difference (232 vs. 256) in the numbers of global

major hurricanes between these two 10-year periods.

COMPARISON OF PACIFIC CATEGORY 4-5 TROPICAL CYCLONE ACTIVITY

DURING THE LAST TWO 10-YEAR PERIODS

The most reliable comparison of Category 4-5 hurricanes that can likely be made is to

compare the last ten years (1995-2004) with the prior ten years (1985-1994) for the

storm areas monitored by US and Japanese satellites.  The reliable observations that

are available from these two US-monitored basins in the Pacific do not indicate that the

global number of tropical cyclones of Category 4-5 intensity have increased in the last

10 years when global surface temperatures have risen.  Despite the last ten years of

warmer global surface temperatures, the number of Category 4-5 hurricanes in the

Pacific shows no increase (Table 2) and in the Atlantic, there have been prior periods in

which Category 4-5 hurricanes have been as frequent as during recent years.

COMPARISON OF ATLANTIC HURRICANE ACTIVITY BETWEEN THE LAST

15-YEAR ACTIVE PERIOD (1990-2004) WITH AN EARLIER ACTIVE

15-YEAR PERIOD (1950-1964)

There have been hurricane periods in the Atlantic in the past which have been just as

active as the current period.  A comparison of the last 15 years of hurricane activity with

an earlier 15-year period from 1950-64 shows no significant difference in major

hurricanes (Table 3).  The number of weak tropical storms rose by over 50 percent,

however.  This is a reflection of the availability of the satellite in the later period.  It

would not have been possible that a hurricane, particularly a major hurricane, escaped

detection in the earlier period.  But many weaker systems far out in the Atlantic

undoubtedly went undetected before satellite observations.  The maximum sustained

winds from 1950-1964 have been adjusted downward using the Landsea (1993)

adjustment factor.

It should also be noted that Emanuel’s large increases in net rate of TC energy

dissipation (his PDI) was derived from only two of the seven global tropical cyclone

basins.    Data from the Northeast Pacific and the other tropical cyclone basins (North

Indian Ocean and the Southern Hemisphere’s three TC basins) were not a part of his

study.  As Table 1 indicates, these other tropical cyclone basins do not show major

hurricane increases over the last two 10-year periods.

SUMMARY

Despite what many in the atmospheric modeling and forecast communities may believe,

there is no physical basis for assuming that global tropical cyclone intensity or

frequency is necessarily related to global mean surface temperature changes of less
than ±0.5oC.  As the ocean surface warms, global upper air temperatures also increase

to maintain conditionally unstable lapse-rates and global rainfall rates at their required

values.  Seasonal and monthly variations within individual storm basins show only very

low correlations of sea surface temperature (SST) with monthly, seasonal, and yearly

variations of hurricane activity.  These correlations are typically of the order of about

0.3, explaining only about 10 percent of the variance.  Other factors such as

tropospheric vertical wind shear, surface pressure, low level vorticity, mid-level

moisture, etc. play more dominant roles in explaining hurricane variability on these

shorter time scales.  Although there has been a general global warming over the last 10

years, the SST increases in the individual tropical cyclone basins have been smaller

(about half), and according to the observations have not brought about any significant

increases in global major tropical cyclones except for the Atlantic where a shift has been

made to a positive phase of the Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation.    No credible

observational evidence is available or likely will be available in the next few decades

which will be able to directly associate global temperature change to changes in global

tropical cyclone frequency and intensity.

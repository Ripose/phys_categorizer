Abstract:  A  guide  for  deriving  the  corresponding  K-constrained  derivative  formulae  for 

constraints  coupling  functional  variables  has  been  given,  analysing  a  recent  application  in 

liquid film dynamics.

In most fields of physics, requirement of the conservation of some extensive property 

limits the change of physical variables. If functional derivatives are involved in the equations 

that govern the change of physical variables, an account for the constraints needs to be made 

in functional differentiation. In the case the physical equation emerges as an Euler equation, 

from  a  variational  procedure,  determining  the  physical  variable(s)  as  stationary  point(s)  of 

some functional 

[ρA
]

, the well-known method of Lagrange multipliers gives an appropriate 

tool for the account for a constraint

for  the  given  physical  variable.  Some  more  general  treatment  of  constraints,  however,  is 

necessary for other cases. For, the introduction of an undetermined "Lagrange" multiplier in 

itself  only  gives  the  given  physical  equation  enough  freedom  to  be  adjustable  to  be  in 

accordance with the constraint but does not fix one solution (the physical solution), allowing a 

range of (unphysical) solutions. 

As an example, consider the equations of motion

It  follows  from  the  form  of  Eqs.(2a)  and  (2b)  that,  irrespective  of  the  µ's,  the  solution  of

. K-conserving differentiation has been extended to treat 

multiple (simultaneous) K-constraints (9) as well [5]. Clarke [1] has applied the method of K-

conserving  differentiation  in  his  above  model  to  determine  proper  µ's  to  account  for  the 

constraints (3) and (4), and verified the obtained  µ's theoretically as well with the help of an 

earlier result in his model [6]. The application of K-conserving differentiation in the case of 

constraints  coupling  variables  of  the  differentiated  functional,  like  Eq.(4),  however,  raises 

some questions, which will be answered in the following, giving a general guide for obtaining 

the constrained derivatives needed.

Other formulae arise as well if the constraint (4) is divided in some proportion between  h  and 

Ambiguity emerging from the above conditions (i)-(ii) for a proper extension

appears  even  in  the  case  of  one  functional  variable  with  a  single  K-constraint,  and  a  third

, that gives the proper 

, unique [8,5]. (For single K-

δ
ρδ
K

constraints, conditions (i) and (iii) alone also yield the proper, unique 

[ρρK
]

 [8].) Conditions 

(i)  and  (ii)  in  themselves  lead  to  an  (ambiguous)  derivative  that  fulfils  only  the  K-equality 

condition  (namely,  the  condition  that  two  functionals  that  are  equal  over  a  K-restricted 

domain should have equal K-conserving derivatives over that domain), and condition (iii) is 

needed  to  fulfil  the  other  condition  for

 for K-independent functionals. The question is as how condition (iii) 

applies  for  the  present  case  of  a  constraint  coupling  two  variables  of  the  same  functional. 

First,  condition  (iii)  applies  for  the  extension  of  the  product  of  the  two  variables 

)(xh

  and

since  the

  that 

satisfy  conditions  (i)  and  (ii),  Eq.(17a)  is  the  proper  one,  that  is,  Eqs.(17)  is  the  full  proper

one of the functional variables.

Note that the two variables can be interchanged in Eq.(26), because of the symmetry of the 

constraints  in  them,  giving  a  further  ambiguity,  similarly  to  the  case  of  two  simultaneous 

constraints on a single functional variable.

In summary, a guide for deriving the corresponding K-constrained derivative formulae 

for  constraints  coupling  functional  variables  has  been  given,  analysing  a  recent  fluid-

dynamical application.

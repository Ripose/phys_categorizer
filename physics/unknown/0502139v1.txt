Abstract

While particle beam steering (and in particular, “scraping”) in accelerators by bent channeling crystals is an
established technique extensively tested at IHEP Protvino and other major high-energy labs, an interesting
question is how one could improve channeling capabilities by applying modern nanotechnology. Theoretical
research of nanotube channeling was in progress over recent years. In this work, we assess potential benefits
from  nanotube  channeling  for  real  accelerator  systems.  We  report  simulation  studies  of  channeling  in
nanostructured material (carbon SWNT and MWNT) tested for possible serving as a primary scraper for the
collimation systems of hadron colliders. The advantages of nanostructured material as a potential choice for
a primary scraper in a high-energy accelerator such as LHC or the Tevatron are discussed in comparison to
crystal  lattices  and  amorphous  material.  We  evaluate  physical  processes  relevant  to  this  application  and
reveal nanotechnology requirements.

1. Introduction

The  technique  of  particle  beam  channeling  by  bent  crystals  is  well  established  at  accelerators  [1]  and
demonstrated in the energy range spanning over six decades [1-14]. For instance, bent crystals are largely
used  for  extraction  of  70-GeV  protons  at  IHEP  (Protvino)  [10-12,15,16]  with  efficiency  reaching  85%  at
intensity  of 1012 particle  per  second,  steered  by  silicon  crystal  of just  2  mm  in  length  [11].  Following  the
successful experiments on crystal channeling in accelerator rings, there has been a strong interest to apply
channeling technique in a TeV-range collider for beam extraction or collimation [2-4,7-9,17-19].

While  bent  crystals  have  found  a  good  niche  for  their  application,  there  is  a  permanent  interest  in
upgrading the capabilities of channeling structures, in order to increase the efficiency of the technique and to
widen its span of applications. There has been large interest recently [20-24] to the possibility of channeling
in the materials produced by nanotechnology.

Fig. 1. Schematic view of nanostructured lattice made of SWNT

Carbon  nanotubes  are  cylindrical  molecules  with  a  typical  diameter  of  order  1  nm  for  single-wall
nanotubes (SWNT) or a few tens nm for multi-wall nanotubes (MWNT) and a length of many microns [25].
They are made of carbon atoms and can be thought of as a graphene sheet rolled around a cylinder, Fig.1.
Creating efficient channeling structures - from single crystals to nanotubes  - might have a significant effect
onto  the  accelerator  world.  With  nanotechnology  in  hands,  there  is  a  principle  possibility  to  engineer  a
channeling lattice from wanted atoms and of wanted configuration, to some extent. Therefore, it would be
interesting to understand what kind of channeling structure we would prefer if we could choose. Ideally, we
would like to trap particles in two dimensions; to have the channel walls made of densely packed atoms; to
make channel size of our choice; to build it with atoms of our choice. This is indeed close to what we get
from nanotechnology nowadays.

2. Halo scraping in colliders

Here we assess potential benefits from nanotube channeling for real accelerator systems on the example
of  halo  scraping  in  colliders.  Classic  two-stage  collimation  system  for  loss  localisation  in  accelerators
typically uses a small scattering target as a primary element and a bulk absorber as secondary element [26].
Normally in colliders and storage rings the halo diffusion is rather slow, therefore the first touch of a halo
particle  with  the  aperture-restricting  collimator  is  rather  a  glancing  touch,  with  impact  parameters  of  the
order  of  a  micron  or  less.  Unfortunately,  particles  interacting  near  to  the  surface  of  a  solid  block  can  be
scattered back in the beam pipe; hence they can be lost far from the cleaning area. The role of the primary
element  is  to  give  a  substantial  angular  kick  to  the  incoming  particles  in  order  to  increase  the  impact
parameter  on  the  secondary  element,  which  is  generally  placed  in  the  optimum  position  to  intercept
transverse or longitudinal beam halo.

An  amorphous  primary  target  scatters  the  impinging  particles  in  all  possible  directions.  Ideally,  one
would  prefer  to  use  a  "smart  target"  which  kicks  all  particles  in  only  one  direction:  for  instance,  only  in
radial  plane,  only  outward,  and  only  into  the  preferred  angular  range  corresponding  to  the  center  of  the
absorber (to exclude escapes).

Fig.2 shows the angular distribution of 7 TeV protons downstream of an amorphous carbon target due to
elastic scattering on carbon nuclei. In accelerator, this Gaussian angular distribution transforms into a broad
radial distribution to be partially intercepted by absorber of the scraping system. Obviously, the distribution
would be peaked at the edge of the intercepting material. The edge leak of outscattered particles is a major
source of inefficiency in this kind of system. However, the LHC  scraping  system  must  have  efficiency  of
interception on the order of 0.9999!

Bent crystal was studied [11,13,18,19] as the first idea for a smart target: it traps particles and forwards
them into the desired direction. Here, the scattering process on single atoms of an amorphous target becomes
the selective and coherent scattering on atomic planes of an aligned mono-crystal.

Fig. 2 shows also an example of the angular distribution of 7 TeV protons channeled and bent 10 µrad by
a  carbon  nanostructure  (made  of  SWNT  with  1.1  nm  diameter)  simulated  in  the  approach  presented  and
discussed in the next section. In this case, all channeled protons can be safely intercepted downstream and

nonchanneled  protons  scatter  in  the  way  similar  to  amorphous  target.  If,  e.g.,  90%  of  halo  protons  were
channeled and just 10% scattered incoherently in the primary target, then the inefficiency (the edge leak) of
the scraping system would reduce by a factor of 10. Below we study in simulations what efficiency can be
achieved here with channeling nanostructures.

atoms of amorphous carbon target and due to channeling in carbon SWNT target.

3. Nanostructured primary scraper

For simulation studies of channeling in nanostructured material (carbon SWNT and MWNT) tested for
possible  serving  as  a  primary  scraper  for  the  collimation  systems  of  hadron  colliders  we  started  from  the
same computer model [27,28] as been used for simulation of a crystal scraping in the Large Hadron Collider
and replaced bent crystal by a nanostructured primary scraper bent a small angle to steer the impinging halo
particles.  Simulations  were  done  in  the  LHC  both  at  the  collision  energy  of  7  TeV  and  at  the  injection
energy  of  450  GeV.  In  the  model,  a  nanostructured  scraper  was  positioned  as  a  primary  element  at  a
horizontal  coordinate  of  6σ  in  the  halo  of  the  LHC  beam,  on  one  of  the  locations  presently  chosen  for
amorphous primary elements of the LHC collimation system design [29-31]. The LHC lattice functions were
taken corresponding to this position: αx=1.782 and βx =119 m in the horizontal plane, and αy = −2.02 and βy
=143.6 in the vertical plane. The α and β functions define the transfer matrix which transforms the angles
and coordinates of the particle revolving in the accelerator ring before the particle can interact again with the
scraper; further details can be found e.g. in ref. [1] or any accelerator textbook.

The  particles  were  tracked  through  the  curved  lattice  of  nanotubes  in  the  approach  with  a  continuous
potential  described  in  more  detail  elsewhere  [32].  We  varied  nanotube  parameters  such  as  the  length,
diameter, bending, alignment angle, and the structure: either SWNT or MWNT. We observed the efficiency
of channeling, i.e., the number of the particles deflected at the full bending angle of the lattice, taking into
account many turns in the LHC ring and multiple encounters with the nanostructured scraper.

Only the halo particles incident into the opening of any particular nanotube within its angular acceptance
could  have  chances  to  be  channeled  and  bent  some  angle.  Particles  falling  between  the  nanotubes  in  the
lattice were not channeled. The nonchanneled particles still experience coherent and incoherent scatterings
in the bulk of nanostructured scraper material, including a chance of inelastic nuclear interaction. For these
processes  we  assumed  the  density  of  nanostructured  target  equal  to  that  of  graphite.  We  assumed  that  we
have no amorphous inclusions in the target, so the incident particles can be channeled already on the very
first encounter. The inner diameter of simulated MWNT was 2 nm (few nm is a typical value for MWNT).

Fig.  3.  The  overall  (multi-pass)  channeling  efficiency  F  of  nano-structured  scraper  shown  as  a
function of bending angle for SWNT (0.4 and 1.1 nm diameter) and MWNT at 7 TeV.

Fig. 3 shows the computed channeling efficiency as a function of the bending angle of the nanostructured
lattice for 7 TeV protons. For each bending angle the optimal length of the structure was found. The optimal
length  is  about  1  mm  for  10-µrad  bending.  High  efficiency  of  channeling  can  be  obtained  with  the  same
structure both at 7 TeV and at 450 GeV (injection energy in the LHC ring). The efficiency F can be as high
as 0.99-0.997 for the small bendings studied in Fig. 3, thanks to the low divergence of halo particles incident
onto  aligned  structure  and  to  a  large  extent  thanks  to  the  possibility  of  multiple  encounters  of  circulating
halo  particles  with  channeling  structure.  Fig.  4  shows  the  same  data  plotted  as  a  “background  reduction
factor” 1/(1-F). We expect the intensity of the halo (causing the background irradiation in the machine) to be
reduced by this factor thanks to the effect of channeling. If all channeled particles were fully intercepted by
the  secondary  collimator,  then  only  non-channeled  particles  could  contribute  to  the  background  in  the
accelerator; therefore the scraping efficiency improves by the above-mentioned factor.

Fig. 4. The same data as in previous Figure, plotted as an LHC background reduction factor 1/(1-F) as
a function of bending angle, for carbon SWNT and MWNT.

For an efficient operation, the nanostructure must be oriented parallel to the envelope of the circulating
beam. According to simulations, for best channeling efficiency, the nanostructure has to be aligned with the
accuracy of about ±3 µrad. Obviously, this also means that the nanotubes within the lattice must be parallel

to each other with the same precision. Notice that conventional beam collimation elements at the LHC have
to be aligned with 15 µrad accuracy [29-31].

An important issue is the power deposit through particle hits inducing thermal shock, radiation damage
and eventually reducing the structure lifetime. The halo intensity in LHC is order of 109 proton/s. In typical
channeling tests at IHEP U-70, crystal channeled ~1012 protons in a spill of 0.5-1 s duration [11]. One of the
IHEP crystals served in the vacuum chamber of U-70 over 10 years, from 1989 to 1999, delivering beam to
particle  physicists,  until  a  new  crystal  replaced  it.  For  nanostructures  there  is  not  enough  data,  although
damage  processes  are  being  evaluated  [33].  However  crystals  show  a  huge  margin  of  safety  in  lattice
lifetime and thus raise hope for similar stability of nanostructures.

4. Conclusions

From physics standpoint, channeling nano-structures could be an interesting and very efficient choice for
the  primary  element  of  the  scraping  system  in  a  collider  or  storage  ring.  Their  use  could  suppress  the
accelerator-related background by a factor of 100-300 if all technological issues are resolved. To be efficient
at  the  energy  as  high  as  7  TeV  of  the  LHC,  the  nanostructures  should  be  as  long  as  about  1  mm;  their
thickness  on  the  order  of  1  µm  is  sufficient  for  effective  channeling  of  halo  particles.  Another  major
requirement is alignment as good as about ±3 µrad at 7 TeV. At lower energy the requirements are  much
less stringent; e.g., at 70 GeV the nanostructures as short as some 20 µm produce significant steering effect
on particles [34].

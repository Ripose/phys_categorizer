Abstract 

2

An analytical analysis is presented of the transport and capture of magnetic micro/nano-

particles  in  a  magnetophoretic  microsystem  that  consists  of  an  array  of  integrated  soft-

magnetic  elements  embedded  beneath  a  microfluidic  channel.  The  elements,  which  are 

polarized by a bias field, produce a nonuniform field distribution that gives rise to a force 

on magnetic particles within the microchannel. The equations governing particle motion 

are  derived  using  analytical  expressions  for  the  dominant  magnetic  and  fluidic  forces. 

The magnetic force is obtained using an analytical expression for the field distribution in 

the microchannel combined with a linear magnetization model for the magnetic response 

of particles. The theory takes into account particle size and material properties, the bias 

field, the dimensions of the microchannel, the fluid properties, and the flow velocity. The 

equations  of  motion  are  solved  to  study  particle  transport  and  capture.  The  analysis 

indicates that the particles exhibit an oscillatory motion as they traverse the microsystem, 

and that a high capture efficiency can be obtained in practice.  

 

 

 

 

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

Research for the development of magnetophoretic microsystems is substantial and 

growing  rapidly  due  primarily  to  applications  in  microbiology  and  biomedicine.  In 

applications such as bioseparation, immuno-assays, and drug delivery, magnetic particles 

are  used  to  label  and  manipulate  biomaterials  (cells,  enzymes,  proteins,  DNA),  and  to 

transport  therapeutic  drugs.1  The  rapid  progress  in  these  areas  is  due  to  several  factors 

including  advances  in  microfluidic  technology,  and  the  development  of  functionalized 

magnetic particles that can selectively label, isolate, and transport a target biomaterial.2-4   

Magnetophoretic  microsystems  are  well  suited  for  bioapplications  because  they 

enable  (i)  fast  reaction  times,  (ii)  the  analysis  and  monitoring  of  small  samples 

(potentially  picoliters),  and  (iii)  the  integration  of    “micro  total  analysis  systems” 

(µTAS) .5,6 They have additional advantages in that the relatively low permeability of an 

aqueous  medium  enables  efficient  coupling  between  an  applied  field  and  the 

magnetically 

labeled  material.  Moreover, 

the  relatively 

low 

intrinsic  magnetic 

susceptibility of biomaterials provides substantial contrast between labeled and unlabeled 

material, which enables a high degree of detection and selectivity.  

Several  magnetophoretic  microsystems  have  been  developed  for  applications 

ranging from bioseparation to cell sorting.7-12 In most of these systems the magnetic force 

is  provided  by  integrated  electromagnets.  However,  Han  and  Frazier  have  recently 

demonstrated a passive microsystem for sorting blood cells in which the field and force 

are  provided  by  an  integrated  soft-magnetic  element  and  an  external  bias  field.12    This 

system is designed to process biofluids containing both paramagnetic red blood cells and 

diamagnetic white blood cells. Specifically, when these two types of cells flow through 

3

the microsystem they experience a force of opposite polarity, that causes them to migrate 

towards  separate  outlet  channels, 

thereby  effecting  cell  sorting.  The  magnetic 

susceptibility  of  these  cells  is  low,  and  therefore  a  large  force  is  needed  to  implement 

separation.  It  is  difficult  to  achieve  a  viable  force  for  this  application  using 

electromagnets,  as  this  would  require  a  prohibitive  level  of  current.  In  this  regard, 

integrated  soft-magnetic  elements  have  advantages  over  electromagnets  in  that  they  (i) 

provide substantially more field and force for a given volume of material, (ii) consume no 

power,  and  (iii)  generate  no  heat.  As  such,  they  hold  great  potential  for  a  variety  of 

existing  and  new  magnetophoretic  applications.    However,  despite  their  advantages, 

relatively few authors have considered particle transport in micosystems that utilize these 

elements.  Instead,  most  of  the  theoretical  work  has  been  directed  towards  systems  that 

use electromagnets.8-10  

Particle transport in magnetophoretic micosystems has been studied using various 

theoretical  approaches,  depending  on  the  complexity  of  the  system.  Typically,  finite 

element analysis (FEA) is used to determine the magnetic field and force, and the particle 

motion is obtained using Newtonian analysis. However, numerical methods such as FEA 

are not well suited for the kind of parametric analysis that is needed for optimization, and 

are impractical for large-scale simulations. An analytical modeling approach is preferable 

for the development of new systems because it (i) provides insight into the fundamental 

behavior  of  the  microsystem,  (ii)  enables  the  analysis  of  large-scale  systems,  (iii) 

provides exact solution values at each point in the solution space (as compared to mesh 

dependent interpolated or averaged values), and (iv) is well suited for parametric analysis. 

In  this  article  we  use  analytical  analysis  to  study  the  transport  and  capture  of 

magnetic  micro/nano-particles 

in  a  passive  magnetophoretic  microsystem.  The 

microsystem  consists  of  an  array  of  integrated  soft-magnetic  elements  embedded  in  a 

 

4

nonmagnetic substrate beneath a microfluidic channel (Figs 1 and 2). A bias field is used 

to polarize the elements, which produce a field gradient that imparts a force to magnetic 

particles  within  the  microchannel.  We  derive  the  equations  of  motion  for  the  particles 

using analytical expressions for the dominant magnetic and fluidic forces. The magnetic 

force  is  obtained  using  an  analytical  expression  for  the  field  distribution  in  the 

microchannel,  combined  with  a  linear  magnetization  model  with  saturation  for  the 

magnetic response of particles. The theory takes into account key variables including the 

size and properties of the particles, the bias field, the dimensions of the microchannel, the 

fluid properties, and the flow velocity. We use these equations to study particle transport 

and capture in a practical microsystem. Our analysis demonstrates that the magnetic force 

within the microsystem is more than sufficient to enable efficient particle capture, which 

makes  it  a  viable  candidate  for  a  variety  of  bioapplications.  Moreover,  our  analysis 

further  indicates  that  the  particles  exhibit  an  interesting  oscillatory  motion  as  they 

traverse the microsystem. This behavior could be exploited for a variety of applications, 

including the characterization of fluids at the micro or nanoscale.   

II. THEORY 

Particle  transport  in  a  magnetophoretic  system  is  governed  by  various  forces 

including (a) the magnetic force due to all field sources, (b) viscous drag, (c) inertia, (d) 

gravity, (e) buoyancy, (f) thermal kinetics, (g) particle/fluid interactions (perturbations to 

the flow field), and (h) interparticle effects including; (i) magnetic dipole interactions, (ii) 

electric  double-layer 

interactions,  and 

(iii)  van  der  Walls 

force.  For  most 

magnetophoretic  applications  involving  submicron  particles,  the  magnetic  and  viscous 

forces  are  dominant,  and  one  can  ignore  all  other  effects.  However,  it  is  instructive  to 

estimate the magnitude of the other forces for our application. To this end, we compute

fρ =

kg/m3,  and  g  =  9.8  m/s).  We  obtain  Fg  =  2.618  ×  10-2  pN,  and  Fb =  0.523  ×  10-2  pN, 

which are more than an order of magnitude smaller than the magnetic force (several pico-

Newtons), as shown below. Thus, these forces can be neglected in our analysis. Similarly, 

the inertial force 

pm a  is also a second order term and could be neglected, but we choose 

to include it in our analysis as noted below. As for the other forces, we assume that we 

are  dealing  with  dilute  particle  suspensions  (particle  volume  concentration  c  <<  1),  in 

which  case,  interparticle  effects  and  particle/fluid  interactions  can  also  be  neglected.13 

We  further  restrict  the  analysis  to  particles  that  are  sufficiently  large  so  that  thermal 

kinetics  (Brownian  motion)  can  be  ignored.  For  example,  for    Fe3O4  particles  in  water, 

Brownian motion is negligible when the particle diameter is greater than 40 nm.14   

In this paper, we consider the transport of magnetic micro/nano-particles in slow 

flow  regimes  where  the  magnetic  and  viscous  drag  forces  dominate,  and  where  the 

motion of the particle can be predicted using Newton’s second law,

small,  and  could  be  neglected,  but  we  choose  to  include  it  to  obtain  more  accurate 

particle  trajectories  during  periods  of  high  acceleration.  However,  an  adequate

As  noted  above,  Newton’s  equation  (1)  does  not  take  into  account  Brownian 

motion, which can influence particle capture when the particle diameter 

pD is sufficiently 

small. Gerber et al.14 have developed the following criterion to estimate this diameter,

where  F  is  the  magnitude  of  the  total  force  acting  on  the  particle,  k  is  Boltzmann’s

Fe3O4  particles  in  water  is

In order to solve either Newton’s equation (1) or the advection-diffusion equation (6), one 

needs an expression for the forces  mF  and 

fF , which we obtain below.   

To  determine  the  magnetic  force  mF  in  Eq.  (2),  we  use  a  linear  magnetization 

model with saturation to predict the magnetization 

pM  of the particle, in which 

pM  is a 

linear function of the field up to a saturation value Msp . Specifically, below saturation,

However, 

biasH  and 

eH are not both independent. Specifically, 

eH  depends on 

biasH  as it 

is the bias field that magnetizes the soft-magnetic elements. Therefore, 

biasH  induces

eH .  

A. The Bias Field 

 

As noted above, a bias field is needed to magnetize the soft-magnetic elements in 

the microsystem so that they produce a local field gradient in the microchannel. Without 

this gradient, there is no magnetic force on the particles.  The bias field also contributes 

to the magnetization of the particles. A strong bias field can be obtained by positioning 

rare-earth  permanent  magnets  above  and  below  the  microsystem  as  shown  in  Fig.  1a.  

Permanent  magnets  have  advantages  over  conventional  electromagnets  in  that  they  (i) 

produce a substantially higher bias field for a given volume of material, (ii) consume no 

energy, and (iii) generate no heat.  

The bias field can be predicted and optimized using analytical analysis. Consider 

the  magnet  shown  in  Fig.  3a.  The  bias  field  is  the  z-component  of  the  magnetic  field, 

which is given by17

 are the coordinates of its corners. It is important to note that the x, y,

analysis below.

The dimensions of the bias magnet are chosen  to  be  much  greater  than  those  of 

the  microsystem  so  that  the  bias  field  will  be  uniform  across  the  microchannel.    Rare-

earth  magnets  such  as  neodymium-iron-boron  (NdFeB)  are  ideal  for  this  application.  

Consider  a  pair  of  identical  NdFeB  magnets  positioned  as  shown  in  Fig.  1a.  The 

saturation magnetization for medium grade NdFeB is 

bsM 8.0 10 A / m
×

=

. We use this 

value in (19) to compute the field distribution in the middle of the gap. Assume that the 

magnets have a cross-sectional area  magA  = 20 mm ×  20 mm facing the gap, and a height 

hmag  =  20  mm.  Further  assume  that  the  gap  g  =  4  mm,  and  that  the  microsystem  is 

centered in the gap, 2 mm from the surface of either magnet. The field distribution in the 

middle of the gap at z = g/2 is shown in Fig. 4b. We spatially integrate this to obtain an 

average value

,  which  is  more  than  sufficient  to  saturate  the  soft-magnetic 

elements  in  the  microsystem,  as  this  is  several  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than  the 

coercivity of materials such a permalloy that are commonly used for these applications.17 

In fact, for many applications, it sufficient to use a single bias magnet, and Eqs. (19) and 

(20) can be used to optimize its dimensions.  

In summary, our analysis indicates that a bias field strong enough to saturate the 

soft-magnetic elements can easily be obtained using rare-earth permanent magnets. Thus, 

in  the  flowing  sections  we  treat  these  elements  as  individual  field  sources  with  a  fixed 

magnetization

B. Field and Force of a Single Magnetic Element 
  

Analytical  expressions  for  the  field  and  force  of  a  single  rectangular  magnetic 

element of width 2w and height 2h that is centered with respect to the origin in the x-y 

plane  (Fig.  4a)  have  been  previously  derived  and  verified  using  FEA.17,19    They  are 

repeated here for convenience. Assume that the element is magnetized to saturation  Mes  

by a bias field  Hbias in the vertical direction (along the y-axis). The field components are

C. Field and Force of a Magnetic Element Array 
 

 Analytical expressions for the field and force due to a linear array of soft-

magnetic elements have also been previously derived, and are repeated here for 

convenience.19   Let Ne denote the number of elements in the array, and let the fist 

element be centered with respect to the origin in the x-y plane. All other elements are 

positioned along the x-axis as shown in Fig. 4b. We identify the elements using the index 

n = (0,1,2,3,4, …, Ne -1). The field components due to the first element (n = 0) are given 

by Eqs. (21), (22). The n’th element is centered at 

x

s=

 on the x-axis, and its field and 

n

force components can be written in terms of the 0’th components as follows:

D. Fluidic Force 

To evaluate the fluidic force in Eq.  (3) we need an expression for the fluid 

velocity 

fv  in the microchannel. Let L denote the length of the channel and 

ch and 

cw denote the half-height and half-width of its rectangular cross section (Fig. 2). The 

nature of the flow, laminar or turbulent, is estimated from the Reynolds number 

Re

= D
v
f

/ρ η

, where D is the characteristic length of the channel (the hydraulic 

diameter), and  ρ and η are the density and viscosity of the fluid, respectively. In 

bioseparation applications V < 1 m/s, D ≈ 200 µm, 

ρ≈

1000 kg/m

, and 

3

η≈

0.001 kg/m s

i . Therefore,  Re

≈

200

 which indicates laminar flow (i.e.,  Re 2000

<

).  

We assume fully developed laminar flow with the flow velocity parallel to the x-axis, and 

varying across its cross section,

It is convenient to use coordinates  y′  and  z′  centered with respect to the cross section of 

the channel, and it is understood that these differ from the coordinate system used for the 

magnetic analysis (Figs. 2 and 4).  Here, 

'z  spans the width of the channel. The velocity 

profile for fully developed laminar flow is20

where 

A = 4h cw  is the cross-sectional area, and 

c

fv  is the average fluid velocity. If the 

channel is short relative to its width (

h w (cid:19) ), which is typically the case, and if we

ignore the variation in velocity along the width of the channel (i.e. along the

III. RESULTS 
 

We demonstrate Eqs. (21), (22), and (31) - (34) via application to hypothetical but 

practical microsystem. Specifically, we study the behavior of magnetite (Fe3O4) particles 

in a microsystem with a fluid channel that is 200 µm high, 1 mm wide, and 10 mm long 

( ch = 100 µm,  

cw = 500 µm, and L = 10 mm). The fluid is nonmagnetic (

0χ = ), and 

f

17

 

 

 

 

has a viscosity and density equal to that of water, 

η=

0.001

 N⋅s/m2, and

fρ =

1000

 kg/m3 

⋅  There  is  an  array  of  10  permalloy  (78%  Ni  22%  Fe, 

esM =

8.6 10  A/m

×

)  elements 

embedded  immediately  beneath  the  microchannel.17  Each  element  is  100  µm  high,  and 

100 µm wide ( h = 50 µm,  w = 50 µm), and they are spaced 50 µm apart (edge to edge). 

Throughout this analysis we assume that the bias field is 0.25 T, which is provided by a 

single NdFeB magnet positioned beneath the microsystem. 

The  Fe3O4  particles  have 

the  following  properties: 

pR =  250 

  nm, 

pρ =

5000 kg/m

, and 

3

M 4.78 10  A/m

Throughout this analysis we use a coordinate system centered with respect to the 

first element (Fig. 4a).  First, we compute the field and force along a horizontal line at 

two different heights y = h + 50 µm, h + 100 µm (50 µm and 100 µm above the elements).

yB  are  for  the  magnetized  elements  only,  and  do  not  include  the  bias  field.  Notice 

that 

xB (Fig. 5) peaks near the edges of the element ( = ±x

w ) and alternate in sign from 

one edge to the other, whereas 

yB  (Fig. 6) obtains its maximum value at the center of the 

element (

x = ). The horizontal force 

0

xF  (Fig. 7) has a profile similar to 

xB , but with an 

opposite polarity of sign. Thus, as a particle moves from left to right above an element it 

 

 

18

experiences  a  horizontal  acceleration  as  it  passes  the  leading  edge,  followed  by  a 

deceleration as it passes the trailing edge. 

The  profile  of  the  vertical  force  component

yF  (Fig.  8)  changes  with  distance 

above the element.  Specifically, close to the element 

yF  exhibits dual minima (attractive 

force) near the edges of the element.19 However, farther away, a single minimum occurs 

at  the  center  of  the  element  (Fig.  8b).  One  of  the  most  interesting  aspects 

yF  is  that  it 

alternates  in  polarity  (direction)  across  an  element.  Specifically,  it  is  positive  (upward) 

just  to  the  left  of  an  element,  negative  (downward)  directly  above  an  element,  and 

positive (upward) just to the right of an element. Therefore, as a particle moves across an 

element it first accelerates upward, then downward, and then upward again as it passes 

the element. This behavior is due to the nature of the force that the particle experiences, 

which, in turn, is due to the bias field and the collective field of the magnetized elements. 

In particular, the bias field tends to impose an upward vertical polarization in the particle 

throughout its range of motion, whereas the magnetized elements produce a field gradient 

that changes in both magnitude and sign pointwise within the microchannel. This gives 

rise  to  a  spatially  varying  force  on  the  particle  that  is  attractive  in  some  regions  and 

repulsive in others. Thus, the particle exhibits oscillatory motion as it moves through the 

microsystem as shown below.      

We now study the behavior of a particle as it moves through the microsystem. We 

assume  that  the  particle  enters  the  microchannel  to  the  left  of  the  first  element  at 

x

(0)

= −

w

,  and  compute  its  trajectory  as  a  function  of  its  initial  height  above  the 

magnetized elements: ∆y = 10 µm, 20 µm, …, 140 µm (i.e., initial heights of y(0) = 60 

µm,  70  µm,  …,  190  µm).  The  average  fluid  velocity  is 

=

10 mm/s,

 and  the  particle 

fv

enters the channel with this velocity, 

pv (0) 10 mm/s.

=

 As above, the bias field is 0.25 T. 

 

19

The  computed  particle  trajectories  are  shown  in  Fig.  9.  It  is  easy  to  identify  each 

trajectory with its entry height as this is the y-intercept for that plot.  For this analysis we 

integrated Eqs. (42) and (43) using an implicit time-stepping algorithm, and it took only a 

few minutes to complete the simulation. We also used a fourth order Runge-Kutta time-

integration  scheme,  and  found  no  difference  in  our  results.  According  to  the  analysis, 

particles  that  enter  the  microchannel  0-130  µm  above  the  magnetized  elements  will  be 

captured, but those entering 130 µm and above will pass through the system. The capture 

time (the time it takes for the particle to reach the bottom of the microchannel where it is 

held  in  place)  is  plotted  as  a  function  of  entry  height  in  Fig.  10.  This  plot  shows  that 

particles entering at heights 0-100 µm above the elements will be captured within 130 ms. 

Notice  that  the  capture  time  is  minimum  for  particles  that  enter  the  channel  50-60  µm 

above the elements. Particles that enter at lower heights (∆y = 0 ,.., 40 µm) experience a 

substantial  vertical  repulsive  (upward)  force  prior  to  reaching  the  first  element,  which 

tends to extend their travel distance thereby increasing their capture time. Particles that 

enter at higher heights (∆y = 70 ,…, 140 µm) bypass the first element, and therefore have 

extended trajectories and longer capture times.   

The capture efficiency of this system can be estimated as follows. If we assume 

that  the  particles  are  uniformly  distributed  height-wise  as  they  enter  the  microchannel, 

then the percentage of particles captured will be equal to the maximum predicted capture 

entry height 130 µm, divided by the total height of the microchannel, which is 200 µm. 

Based  on  this  analysis,  approximately  65%  of  the  particles  that  enter  the  microsystem 

will  be  captured.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  dimensions  and  parameters  used  in  this 

analysis were chosen to simply demonstrate the theory, and were not intended to optimize 

the capture efficiency.   However, the capture efficiency for a proposed microsystem can 

 

20

be  optimized  prior  to  fabrication  by  performing  a  parametric  analysis  to  determine  the 

dimensions,  spacing,  and  number  of  soft-magnetic  elements  that  optimize  capture  for  a 

given  particle,  microchannel,  and  flow  rate.    In  principle,  a  capture  efficiency  of  100% 

can  be  achieved  by  increasing  the  size  and  number  of  soft-magnetic  elements,  or  by 

reducing the height of the microchannel.  

Finally,  the  microsystem  described  above  has  potential  for  a  variety  of 

applications especially in the field of microbiology where it can be used to transport, sort, 

and  separate 

functionalized  magnetic  micro/nano-particles  with  surface-bound 

biomaterial. Our analysis indicates that the magnetic force generated by this system is on 

the  order  of  100  pN,  which  is  more  than  sufficient  to  effect  particle  capture  in 

applications such as bioseparation where the fluidic force is much lower. Furthermore, it 

might be possible to use this system to study fluid properties at the micro and nanoscale 

by sensing the oscillatory motion of the magnetic particles as they pass through it. This 

motion  gives  rise  to  a  time  varying  magnetic  field  which  could  potentially  be  sensed 

using  an  integrated  magnetometer.    The  magnitude  of  and  period  of  the  sensor  signal 

could  be  used  to  determine  the  fluid  properties  such  as  viscosity,  which  influences  the 

drag and hence the motion of the particle.    

IV. CONCLUSION 
 

We  have  studied  magnetophoretic  particle  transport  and  capture  in  a  novel 

microsystem that consists of an array of integrated soft-magnetic elements embedded in a 

nonmagnetic substrate beneath a microfluidic channel. The elements are polarized using a 

bias  field,  and  produce  a  force  on  magnetic  micro/nanoparticles  as  they  traverse  the 

microchannel.  We  have  derived  the  equations  of  particle  motion  using  analytical 

expressions  for  the  dominant  magnetic  and  fluidic  forces  on  the  particles.  The  theory 

 

21

applies to dilute suspensions of particles for which interparticle effects are negligible. It 

takes into account the size and properties of the particles, the bias field, the dimensions of 

the microchannel, the fluid properties, and the flow velocity. We have used the theory to 

study  particle  transport  and  capture  in  a  practical  microsystem,  and  our  analysis 

demonstrates the viability of using the microsystem for a variety of bioapplications such 

as  bioseparation.  Furthermore,  the  spatially  periodic  nature  of  the  force  within  the 

microchannel could be used for various other applications including the characterization 

of the transport fluid at the micro or nanoscale.

Abstract

The Olbers conjecture, that under reasonable assumptions, light from the
stars should sum at the Earth to make the sky bright at night, has been a
subject of study since the early 19th century.   It has been incorporated
into some of modern cosmology.  To complement Olbers's conjecture, we
suggest a new calculation modelled as a projecture in the form of an
imaginary star probe.  We also give an analytic proof of Olbers's.

Introduction

Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers (1758 - 1840), in 1823 presented an argument, many
times repeated in many ways, by which it would seem that the night sky should be
bright, not dark [1 - 4].   An earlier conjecture on the same theme is attributed to
Kepler [5].

All forms of Olbers's argument go like this:  We assume the universe at least out

to a very great distance to be populated with some average density of stars.
Drawing a set of equally-spaced concentric spherical shells around the Earth, each
n-th shell will contain a number of stars proportional on the average to its volume.
The volume of each shell will increase as the square of its average radius; the angle
on Earth subtended by a star in that shell will decrease as the square of that shell's
average radius.  The two squares cancel, so, for all shells beyond some reasonably
great distance from Earth, the amount of star light contributed to Earth by each
shell roughly will be equal to that of any other shell.   But, the number of shells
must be very great if not infinite; therefore, an observer on Earth should see the
sum of all shells, a solid wall of stars, and so the sky should be very bright at night.

On thinking this through, one realizes that whereas a star can block a line of

sight to empty, starless patches of sky, the reverse does not hold:  Empty sky can not
block a star.  Therefore, the asymmetry seems to favor light over dark,
strengthening the conjecture.

Notice that this result is not logically self-contradicting; so, strictly speaking, it is
not a paradox.  It is, rather, an apparently valid physical assertion which obviously
can not be true.   A paradox would be self contained and have no physical reference
to fact:  For example, the liar's paradox:  "I never tell the truth".   There is no
meaningful physics involved in a paradox.

Because Olbers's logic is self-consistent, the present author will refer to it as the

Olbers Conjecture as to the darkness of the sky, rather than as the "Olbers
Paradox".

Edgar Allen Poe is said to have speculated that the newly measured finite speed

of light was responsible:  Light from the farthest shells had not yet had time to
reach Earth.   The general explanation accepted by astrophysicists is that the age of
the universe, its finite size, and the density of the stars conspire to render the

Olbers Conjecture ineffective.   However, there has been a claim [6] that the 2.7 K
cosmic microwave background represents the Olbers Conjecture in action.

One relativity web site [1] lists these explanations (reworded):

•  There's too much cosmic dust
•  The number of stars is too small
•  The stars are not uniform enough; they block one another
•  The expanding universe red-shifts distant stars into obscurity
•  The age of the universe has not allowed time for all the light to reach

us [Poe's argument].

A posting [7] by Herb Weiner, refuting a solution by Marilyn Vos Savant, uses a
galaxy atlas to compute that the number of stars actually is too small.  Some more
general computations by Imamura [8] put the blame primarily on the age of the
universe; but with enough stars, one can illuminate anything!

Olber's Conjecture seems to hang around forever in the sky.   Almost everyone
introduced to it seems to ponder it a while, see that it seems reasonable, fail to find
an error, and then do nothing much about it.

I would like first to construct a new but similar conjecture which should shed

some new light on Olbers's and then provide yet another simple analytic
confirmation of Olbers's own argument.

A Telescopic Projecture

The result of this little exercise agrees quantitatively, happily, with that of

Imamura [8].  This probably is pure chance, however.

The upper half of Figure 1 shows an observation station on Earth equipped with a

device which telescopes into space.  The device consists of a circular cylinder one
parsec in diameter which may be extended into space indefinitely, growing at close
to the speed of light on the end shown to the right.   The distant surface of the
cylinder is an opaque cap, and its walls exclude light except that originating within
the cylinder.  Stars may drift in and out of the cylinder, but those within have all
their emission in the direction of Earth captured and conveyed to Earth in either of
two ways: (a) parallel modes as though by a huge bundle of optical fibers; or, (b)
simple direct, square-law radiation (the operator flips a switch to choose), with walls
of the cylinder perfectly absorbing.  An observer either may measure the total light
gathered by the device at point A, or may look directly into the cylinder at point B.

Figure 1.  (1) Telescopic mechanism to gather starlight.  (2) View from B
after operation for about 15 years.  The concentric field markers each
represent one light-year.   (3) view from B after an indefinite operating
period (field markers omitted).

My projecture is that if I wait long enough, I can use the fiber-optic mode to
gather energy equivalent to the emission from the surface of a star 1 parsec in
diameter.  So, assuming the stars all are about uniformly distributed in space, say,
an average of 1 per 10 cubic parsecs, and that each is 106  km in diameter (about
8 1011
km2  projected area), I wait.   My telescopic device grows by about 10 cubic
parsecs, or one star, per year.

After about 15 years, my telescopic device is almost 15 light-years long, and light

from 7 or 8 years past is available.  So, as shown in Figure 1, part 2, by direct
viewing, I see perhaps a dozen stars.   Notice that growing the telescopic device
versus assuming immediate availability of starlight only makes a difference of a
factor of two.  Even after 20 or 30 years, all I see by direct view is as shown in
Figure 1, part 3.  The reason is that the angle subtended by the distant cap has
become vanishingly small, and all the numerous, distant stars are bunched up
almost to a point.   Because no star comes even close to filling a parsec, the average
light collected at A in Figure 1 will be extremely weak.

Using the fiber-optic view, though, how long will I have to wait before I have
achieved my goal?  This is difficult to answer exactly:  A parsec is about 3.26 light-

Using the projecture to predict the night sky, there is no chance that the Olbers
Conjecture could yield a sky bright enough to equal that of the surface of the Sun.
Even if it were valid, the best that might be expected would be a weak but visible
glow about 6 log units dimmer than sunlight.

Analytic Argument

Let's follow through very closely on the Conjecture as usually stated.  In Figure 2,
star-filled Gaussian spheres are used to define spherical shells centered on a point of
observation such as the Earth.   We define a spherically symmetrical,
omnidirectional light-detector at the center with total sensitive area A.   Without
loss of generality, A is assumed constant as viewed from any direction in the sky.

Figure 2.   Basic construction of the Olbers Conjecture.   Concentric
spherical shells of equal thickness  D r  define the domain of analysis of
the stars.

Assuming that the stars on the average are uniformly distributed in space and
have equal luminous flux L, let us use  Nn  to represent the number of stars between
shells  n  and  n + 1 .   The volume of this shell will be given by,

If we assume we are far enough from the center to assign all stars in the n-th
shell to the same approximate distance  rn  from the center, the total light  In  shed on
A by the stars in the n-th shell will be given by

so, it is well behaved and approaches a constant as  rn

Olbers stop here.   However, let us look at the intensity ratio between two adjacent,

This means that if we choose closely-enough spaced shells, the contribution of any

adjacent pair of them will be about the same.  This is reassuring, but not very
important.

Let us multiply out the numerator and denominator of (7) to see what happens if

we let the distance go to infinity:

the numerator and denominator grow at the same rate for  rn  large compared with
D r .   This means that,

So, near the Earth, the closer of any pair of shells contributes a little more than the
farther, but the relative contribution of adjacent shells grows to 1 with increasing
distance.  The Olbers Conjecture is that all shells contribute equally, and, so, that
this limit indeed should be equal to 1.

Let's go on to look at the intensity difference between two adjacent shells:

The difference between intensity contributions in adjacent shells is negative,

which is to say that the contribution of the more distant shell is less than that of the
closer one, as we saw for the ratio above, but this difference decreases to 0 as we
look at light from shells farther and farther away.

So, we have again proven the internal consistency of the Olbers Conjecture; but,

it remains inaccurate, given the reality of the universe as we know it.

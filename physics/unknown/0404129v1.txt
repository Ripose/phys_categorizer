The purpose of this paper is to examine the change in
yeast plasma membrane permittivity after heating treatment,
by using the Pauly and Schwan’s theory.

Materials and Method

Yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were grown in
liquid cultures at 27°C and harvested in the stationary
phase after two days. The collected cells were washed with

The mean diameter of the cells was determined aver
about 200 cells by measuring under an optical microscope.
The mean diameter without wall was found to be 3.5 µ m for
dead cells. The values of the cell wall thickness (0.22 µ m
for intact cells and 0.25 µ m for treated cells) were taken
from literature [5].

Results and Discussion

The permittivity and conductivity of viable yeast cell
suspensions show a remarkable dependence on frequency (Fig.
1). Such disperse behaviour is due to the Maxwell-Wagner
mechanism. Further we consider that the cell wall has no
influence on the dielectric dispersion, In the present
experimental conditions.

As shown in Figure 1, the heating treatment gives rise
to a reduction of the dielectric dispersion. Assuming that
the equation (4) is applicable to both living and dead
cells and considering that the capacity of dead cells is
the same as that of viable cells [5], we may write:

respectively.

is determined by the bulk of the membrane materials, does
not change after heating treatment [4,5]. Therefore, we can
conclude that the processes that affect the permittivity of

minor part of the total membrane area. A similar effect has

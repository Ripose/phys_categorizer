Abstract 

It is explicitly shown, for optical processes arbitrarily comprising two-, three- or four-

photon  interactions, that the sum over all matter states of  any optical susceptibility is 

exactly  zero.    The  result  remains  true  even  in  frequency  regions  where  damping  is 

prominent.    Using  a  quantum  electrodynamical  framework  to  render  the  photonic 

nature  of  the  fundamental  interactions,  the  result  emerges  in  the  form  of  a  traceless 

operator  in  Hilbert  space.    The  generality  of  the  sum  rule  and  its  significance  as a 

thermodynamic limit are discussed, and the applicability to real systems is assessed.

Introduction 

In  the  theory  of  linear  and  nonlinear  optical  response  from  atomic  and  molecular 

systems,  a  common  expedient  for  calculational  and  interpretive  simplicity  is  the 

adoption  of  a  two- level  approximation,  in  which  it  is  assumed  that  any  material  of 

interest  has  only  one  significant  electronic  excited  state  in  the  relevant  frequency 

range.   It has been known for some time that this approximation  leads to  an excited 

state polarisability that is the exact negative of the ground state polarisability, and the 

same  proves  true  for  the  ground  and  excited  state  first  hyperpolarisability.    In  the 

bulk,  similar  relationships  hold  for  the  linear  and  second  order  optical  susceptibility 

tensors,  and  the  consequential  possibility  of  observing  novel  harmonic  resurgence 

phenomena  in  suitable  media  has  been  noted  [1].    Recently,  it  has  also  been  shown 

that  the  susceptibility  relationships  retain  validity  even  when  resonance  damping  is 

entertained  [2,  3], provided  the  correct  choice  is  made  for  the  sign  of  the  damping 

corrections, as exacted by the principles of time-reversal invariance. 

In  this  paper  we  develop  a  more  general  theory  by  considering  multi- level 

systems  with  an  arbitrary  number  of  excited  states,  also  considering  higher-order 

optical  processes  such  as  those  involved  in  four-wave  mixing.    Equations  are 

developed  using  a  quantum  electrodynamical  framework  that  faithfully  renders  the 

photonic  nature  of  the  fundamental  interactions  involved.    As  a  result  it  is  explicitly 

shown, for two-, three- and four-photon  interactions, that  for any optical process the 

sum of the susceptibilities for all matter states is zero.  The result remains true even in 

frequency  regions  where  damping  is  prominent.     Applications  range  from  Rayleigh 

scattering,  through  harmonic  generation  to  CARS,  the  ac  Stark  effect  and  phase-

conjugate  reflection.  The  generality of the sum rule and its  physical significance  are 

discussed,  and  the  paper  concludes  with  an  assessment  of  the  applicability  to  real 

systems.

Molecular operators and optical susceptibilities 

For each kind of electromagnetic interaction between matter and radiation  – such as 

the absorption or emission of  single photons,  nonlinear  optical  interactions, and also 

many cooperative or concerted  energy transfer processes, the propensity of any given 

molecule is quantified by a  microscopic susceptibility tensor.   By  methods that have 

been extensively detailed elsewhere,  general expressions for  each such tensor can be 

derived  using  quantum  electrodynamics  (QED)  formulation  [4,  5].    The  quantum 

Hamiltonian  for  a  sub-system  comprising  any  one  optical  centre  x and the radiation 

field can be separated into two terms:  one  is the unperturbed Hamiltonian 

0H , which 

has  contributions  due  to  the  radiation, 

radH ,  and  also  the  Schrödinger  operator  for 

each  optical  centre, 
)

interaction, 

(

( )xmolH

;  the  second  term  is the  corresponding electromagnetic 

intH x .    The  ensemble  response  for  any process  based  on  one-centre 

interactions is then evaluated from the probability amplitude;

n-photon  process  the  leading  contribution  in  the  perturbative  development  of  the 

probability amplitude is the matrix element

,  using  the  implied

)

summation  convention  for  repeated  Cartesian  indices.    From  here  onwards  the  label 

x   is dropped to simplify notation.  In  view  of  the  usual  mode  expansion of 

(

)

 in 

terms  of  creation  and  annihilation  operators,  the  linearity  of  the  interaction 

Hamiltonian  itself ensures that each operation either creates or destroys a photon.  In 

equation (2), the sum over all states and the product over j thus serve to  identify all 

possible  sequences  of  allowed  routes  between  the  initial  and  final  radiation  state  – 

corresponding  to  the  familiar  time  orderings  or  state-sequences.    When  the  explicit 

form of the  interaction  Hamiltonian is substituted, the quantum amplitude can  neatly 

be written as the product of two tensors [7]:

Parametric susceptibilities 

We  now  focus  on  parametric  optical  processes, where  the  matter  and  radiation  field  

energies are conserved independently of each other (for example in second harmonic 

generation, each output photon is created at the expense of  two  input photons of  half 

the frequency, while each optical centre returns to its original state, usually the ground 

state).

therefore,  we  have

In  previous  work  based  on  a  two-level  approximation  it  has  been  shown  that  such 

tensors  rigorously  satisfy  what  we  have  loosely  termed a  ‘mirror’  rule  [1].    This 

simply  affirms  that  the  molecular  tensor  for  an  elastic  optical  process  in  a  pumped 

system  is  the  negative  of its  ground state  value, i.e.

been  reported  and proved  explicitly  both  for  the  linear  polarisability  and  the  first 

hyperpolarisability,  and  it  proves  to  remain  valid  even  under  near-resonance 

conditions  that  necessitate  the  inclusion  of  damping  factors  (see  below).    In general 

the mirror property can be expressed as

susceptibility that vanishes at the threshold of population inversion.   

For  many if not  most  systems, significant departures  from  such a  rule can be 

anticipated,  for  two  reasons:  (i)  the  two-level  approximation  is  seldom  a  good 

representation of  a  complex  electronic  structure  –  other  levels  should  generally  be 

considered;  (ii)  significant  excited  state  populations  are  generally  unsustainable 

except  in  association  with  laser  action  (where  the  dynamical  ensemble  exhibits

following,  we  extend  analysis  to  permit  application  to  systems  departing  markedly 
from  two-level  behaviour, where the  salient  property  sum  is  (cid:229)

vanishing  ensemble  susceptibility;  our  concern  is  with  establishing  the  general 

validity of the new sum rule. 

Before  proceeding  further,  we  note  that  it  is  possible  to  cast  the  generalised 

optical susceptibility  tensor  (9)  in  the  form  of  an  operator

Two -photon process 

The  simplest  case  to  consider  is  Rayleigh  scattering.    With  a  view  to  the  more

Analysis of the  three-photon tensor serves as a  helpful guide to the general principles 

for establishing the validity of the sum rule for any n-photon interaction tensor

From  equation  (12)  it  can  be  seen  that  there  are  3!  [n!]  terms  which  can  be 

grouped in  two [(n-1)!] sets of  three [n] terms each.  The terms in each set are related 

to those in other sets by  cyclic permutation.  Explicitly, the first, third and fifth terms 
in  (12)  represent cyclic permutations of  (

The second  [second  …  (n-1)th]  set  of  terms  in  (12)  cancels  out  in  a  similar  way, 

proving  that  the  sum  rule  is  valid  for  any  parametric  three-photon  [n-photon] 

interaction  process.    Again,  we  have  elsewhere  shown  within  the  two-level 

approximation 

that

Four-photon and higher order  processes 

The same procedure can be used to verify that the four-wave processes also satisfy the 

sum  rule.    In  this  case  we  have  four  photons  satisfying  the  energy  conservation

  can  be  separated  into  six  sets  of  four 

terms  each.    It  can  be  proved,  again  by  renaming  the  dummy  indices  in  the 

corresponding molecular operator, that the four terms comprising each set add to zero.  

As  the  number  of  photons  involved  in  the  optical  process  increases,  the  sum 

increasingly becomes algebraically cumbersome, and for this reason we  refrain from 

presenting the explicit calculations.  The sum rule remains generally valid;

Discussion 

A general proof of the susceptibility sum rule, valid for an arbitrary number of photon 

interactions,  remains  tantalisingly  elusive,  although  the  above  explicit  calculations 

offer important clues.  The underlying principle merits further study, and we conclude 

by  noting  one  novel  but  illuminating  aspect, 

its  fundamental  relation  to  a 

thermodynamic  limit.    In  a  high-temperature,  thermally  equilibrated  system,  the 

fractional  populations  of  all  electronic  states  becomes  equal,  and  for  a  parametric 

process the corresponding ensemble susceptibility is an equally weighted sum of the 

susceptibilities  for  all  such states  –  which  is  thus  zero.    This  directly  relates  to  a 

principle  that,  at  extremely  high  temperatures,  the  propensity  for  any  material  to 

mediate  optical  conversion  becomes  vanishingly  small.    Physically,  this  can  be 

understood  as  an  analogue  of  Curie’s  Law,  and  for  the  same  underlying  reason;  as 

temperature  increases,  thermal  motions  increasingly  interfere  with  the  establishment 

 

 

 

 

 

 

of any polarisation field.

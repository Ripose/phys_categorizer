Abstract:  We  study  basic  properties  of  quiescent  and  rotating  multipole-
mode solitons supported by axially symmetric Bessel lattices in a medium 
with  defocusing  cubic  nonlinearity.  The  solitons  can  be  found  in  different 
rings of the lattice and are stable when the propagation constant exceeds the 
critical value, provided that the lattice is deep enough. In a high-power limit 
t
he multipole-mode solitons feature a multi-ring structure.

Two-dimensional (2D) spatial optical solitons of various types, supported by periodic lattices 
in nonlinear media, have recently attracted a great deal of attention. This was stimulated, first 
of all, by the possibility to create such solitons in photorefractive crystals, where an effective 
photonic lattice is induced by the linear-superposition pattern generated by laser beams illumi-
nating the crystal in the ordinary polarization, while soliton is observed in the extraordinary 
polarization [1-7]. Optical lattice is also an important tool to study nonlinear pattern formation 
in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), where it can support multidimensional solitons, stabili-
zing them against collapse in self-attracting BECs [8]. 

Another possibility for the creation of 2D solitons is offered by a concentric lattice with 
the radial distribution of the intensity obeying the pattern of the Bessel function. Such a cylin-
drical  lattice  can  be  created  by  nondiffracting  linear  optical  beams  [9,10].  Several  types  of 
solitons in this setting have been studied theoretically, assuming focusing or defocusing nonli-
nearity of the medium [11-15]. In particular, rotary solitons, i.e., strongly localized wave pac-
kets rotating at a constant angular velocity in the Bessel lattice, are possible in the latter case 
[11], and stable vorticity-carrying ring-shaped (azimuthally uniform) solitons were predicted 
in the case of defocusing [12]. Dipole-mode solitons that may be regarded as bound states of 
two rotary ones, set at diametrically opposite positions in the same circular trough, were also 
predicted for the focusing nonlinearity [13]. 

A nontrivial possibility that has not been explored before and is the subject of the present 
work, is a possibility to construct stable multipole-mode solitons, featuring an azimuthal struc-
ture, in the system combining the cubic defocusing nonlinearity and a Bessel lattice (we stress 
once again that all the states in axially symmetric defocusing media considered thus far were 
uniform in the azimuthal direction). We aim to construct such patterns of two most fundamen-
tal types, viz., dipole- and quadrupole-mode solitons, both static and rotating, and investigate 
their stability. 

The concept of multi-pole solitons in two dimensions was first explored in Refs [16,17], 
where stabilization of complex multi-pole structures was achieved due to XPM (cross-phase-
modulation) coupling with a nodeless component in a vectorial (two-component) system. Ho-
wever, such solitons require a focusing saturable nonlinearity for their existence. 

Following Refs. [11-15], we assume that an optical beam propagates along the  ξ  axis in 
a bulk medium with defocusing cubic nonlinearity and imprinted transverse modulation of ref-
ractive index. This setting is described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the complex 
field amplitude q :

In  Eq.  (1),  the  longitudinal  ξ  and  transverse 
 coordinates  are  scaled  to  the  diffraction 
length and the width of the input beam, respectively, and  p  measures the depth of the optical 
lattice. We suppose that optical lattice is created by a first-order Bessel beam, whose field is

orthogonal polarizations in a nonlinear medium can be utilized for guiding spatial solitons in 
the concentric lattice. In particular, a Bessel photonic lattice can be induced by an ordinarily 
polarized  nondiffracting  beam  in  a  photorefractive  medium,  while  the  soliton  propagates  in 
the extraordinary polarization. Because of the strong anisotropy of the nonlinear response, the 
Bessel  beam  does  not  feel  the  material  nonlinearity  and  thus  remains  undistorted,  while  the 
extraordinarily polarized probe beam experiences strong nonlinearity. 

Notice that Eq. (1) implies opposite signs of XPM and SPM (self-phase-modulation) non-
linearities, which occurs in semiconductor photorefractive crystals, such as GaAs:Cr, InP:Fe, 
and CdTe:In, that belong to the  43m  point symmetry group [18]. These materials are transpa-

Besides the implementation in optics, Eq. (1) with the same Bessel potential may also be 
interpreted as Gross-Pitaevskii equation for an effectively 2D BEC trapped in a optical lattice 
created by the linear Bessel beam. In terms of the BEC, the defocusing corresponds to positive 
scattering length of atomic collisions (repulsion) in the BEC, while the necessary sign of the 
effective potential in Eq. (1) is provided by choosing the carrier frequency of the optical beam 
to be red-detuned relative to the frequency of the dipole transition in the condensate atoms. In 
either case (optics or BEC), the soliton-carrying field produces no feedback on Bessel lattice. 
Equation (1) conserves the total power (energy flow, or number of atoms in the BEC):

typical profiles of dipole- and quadrupole-mode solitons, which seem, respectively, as patterns 
built of two or four localized spots, with opposite signs of the field in adjacent spots (hence 

 

 

 

 

 

the spots repel each other, which helps to stabilize the patterns). Despite the defocusing cha-
racter of the nonlinearity, solitons are well localized in the radial direction because of the con-
fining action of the lattice. On the other hand, the multipole-mode solitons are not tightly loca-
lized  in  the  azimuthal  direction,  in  contrast  to  the  dipole-mode  solitons  in  the  Bessel  lattice 
with the focusing nonlinearity [13]. 

In the low-amplitude limit, the multipole-mode solitons go over into linear modes guided 
by  the  first-order  Bessel  lattice  (Figs.  1(a)  and  1(c)).  Note  that,  with  decrease  of  the  lattice 
depth, the corresponding linear modes become broader and may occupy several rings of the 
lattice.  In  the  large-amplitude  limit,  solitons  always  expand over  several  rings of  the  lattice, 
see Figs. 1(b) and 1(d). With the growth of the total power, their amplitude only slightly incre-
ases, while expansion in radial direction is conspicuous. This behavior finds its manifestation

and 2(d)). There are lower and upper borders (cutoffs) for the existence of the multipole-mode 
solitons. The power diverges and vanishes as b  approaches, respectively, the lower and upper 
cutoffs, b
 is a monotonically growing function of the 
lattice’s depth  p  , see Figs. 2(b) and 2(e). At a fixed lattice depth, the dipole-mode solitons 
have a larger existence interval (in terms of the propagation constant b ) than the quadrupole-
mode solitons and higher-order ones. In fact, the existence domain gradually shrinks with the 
increase of the soliton order, compare Figs. 2(b) and 2(e). Besides solitons residing in the first 
ring of the Bessel lattice (the one closest to the center)e, we have also found families of the 
dipole- and quadrupole-mode solitons, including stable ones, entrenched father from the cen-
ter, in the rings of a larger radius.

A comprehensive linear stability analysis has revealed that the dipole-mode solitons are 
completely stable if the propagation constant exceeds a certain critical value b , provided that 
the  lattice  is  deep  enough  (

left  domain  (

Multipole-mode solitons can be set in rotation, by imprinting a phase twist onto the input 
field distribution, or by pushing out-of-phase fundamental beams, which form the soliton, in 
opposite directions in  ( ,

spot patterns suggest new possibilities for all-optical routing of light beams. 

Summarizing,  we  have  found  that  cylindrical  optical  lattices  induced  by  nondiffracting 
Bessel beams in medium with defocusing cubic nonlinearity support various stable multipole-
mode solitons. The existence of such complex patterns, that can also stably rotate, essentially 
extends the variety of phenomena generated by Bessel optical lattices. The results suggest new 
ways of manipulating light signals, and the creation of novel localized states in BECs.

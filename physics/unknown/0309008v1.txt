Abstract

A comprehensive study was conducted to determine thorium, uranium and potassium

elemental concentrations in surface soils throughout the accessible area of Cyprus

using high-resolution γ−ray spectrometry. A total number of 115 representative soil

samples were collected from all over the bedrock surface of the island based on the

different lithological units of the study area. The soil samples were sieved through a

0.2-mm mesh, sealed in 1000-mL plastic Marinelli beakers, and measured in the

laboratory in terms of their gamma radioactivity for a counting time of 18 hours each.

From the measured γ−ray spectra, specific activity and elemental concentrations were

determined for thorium (range from 2.5×10−3 to 9.8 ppm), uranium (from 8.1×10−4 to

3.2 ppm) and potassium (from 1.3×10−4 to 1.9 %). The overall mean values (mean ±

S.D.) calculated are 1.2 ± 1.7 ppm, 0.6 ± 0.7 ppm, and 0.4 ± 0.3 %, for thorium,

uranium and potassium, respectively, which are by a factor of three to six lower than

the world average values of 7.4 ppm (Th), 2.8 ppm (U) and 1.3 % (K) derived from

all data available worldwide. The best-fitting relation between the concentrations of

correlation coefficient of 0.93, 0.84, and 0.90, respectively. The Th/U and K/U ratios

(slopes) calculated are equal to 2.04 and 0.28, respectively, while the K/Th ratio was

found equal to 0.14.

1. Introduction

Gamma radiation emitted from naturally occurring radioisotopes (also called

terrestrial background radiation) existing at trace levels in all ground formations, such

as 40K and the radionuclides from the 232Th and 238U series and their decay products,

represents the main external source of irradiation to the human body. More

specifically, natural environmental radioactivity and the associated external exposure

due to gamma radiation depend primarily on the geological and geographical

conditions, and appear at different levels in the soils of each region in the world

(UNSCEAR 2000 Report, and further references cited therein). The specific levels of

terrestrial environmental radiation are related to the geological composition of each

lithologically separated area, and to the content of the rock from which the soils

originate in each area in the radioactive elements of thorium (Th), uranium (U) and

potassium (K). It

is well known, for instance,

that

igneous rocks of granitic

composition are strongly enriched in Th and U (on an average 15 ppm† of Th and 5

ppm of U), compared to rocks of basaltic or ultramafic composition (< 1 ppm of U)

(Faure, 1986; Mènager et al., 1993). For that reason, higher radiation levels are

associated with igneous rocks and lower levels with sedimentary rocks. There are

† Parts per million

exceptions, however, as some shales and phosphate rocks have relatively high content

of those radionuclides (UNSCEAR 2000 Report).

From a geological point of view, the island of Cyprus, which is located in the eastern

basin of the Mediterranean Sea, contains one of the best-preserved and most

intensively studied ophiolite complexes in the world, which is known as the Troodos

Massif (Moores and Vine, 1971; Robinson and Malpas, 1998).

It consists of basic

and ultrabasic pillow lavas, fringed by andesitic-sheeted dykes, while the central part

of the ophiolite consists of basic and ultrabasic plutonic rocks (gabbros, peridotites,

dunites and serpentinized harzburgites). The highly tectonized and fractured

conditions of the Troodos mass, as a consequence of its uplift, facilitated deep

weathering of the rocks, leading to the development of a smooth, mature topography,

mantled with a thick cover of a diversity of soils (Robinson and Malpas, 1998). The

soil cover of the central area is highly alkaline, while the soils on the slopes, lower

down, are covered by neutral sheeted diabase. The weathering of the sedimentary

rocks (chalks, marls, etc.) in the foothills that fringe Troodos, gave rise to alkaline,

calcium rich soils. None of these rock types belongs to the category of silica-

oversaturated, which usually is associated with high Th and U elemental

concentrations (Faure, 1986).

Since no systematic data on environmental radioactivity were available for Cyprus, a

pilot project commenced in 2001 with the objective to systematically measure the

terrestrial gamma radiation in the island, and determine its contribution to the annual

effective dose equivalent to the population. There are two main features that make

this study particularly important and interesting to radiometric studies. Firstly, it

provides

information on the geomorphological

composition and associated

environmental radioactivity of such an area with a large variety of ophiolitic and

sedimentary rock types cropping out over a relatively narrow area. Secondly, the

3

analysis of selective elemental abundance (Th/U, K/U, and K/Th ratios) may also

allow us to study the enrichment/depletion processes as a result of the complex

metamorphic history, alteration and/or weathering that affected the investigating

rocks (Chiozzi et al., 2002).

Tzortzis et al. (2003) reported the first results of such measurements and the

corresponding average annual effective dose rates equivalent to the population, using

a relatively restricted but absolutely representative number of soil samples collected

from all the geological formations appearing in the island. A more extensive and

completed study of terrestrial gamma radioactivity was performed after the collection

of 115 samples from all over the island bedrock surface based on the different

lithological units of the study area. Such a number of collected samples in

combination with the relatively large area portion permitted to study (about 6,000

km2) can be considered as a representative inventory of the various outcropping

geological formations. Other parts of the project aimed to measure the concentration

of radon in houses and public buildings (Anastasiou et al., 2003), as well as to detect

α−emitting radioisotopes by utilizing radioanalytical techniques and high-resolution

α-spectrometry (Pashalidis and Tsertos, 2003). In this paper, the results from this

extensive and representative study regarding Th, U and K elemental concentrations in

a wide variety of surface soils by means of high-resolution γ−ray spectrometry are

presented. Further results from these investigations concerning activity concentrations

and the associated dose rates due to terrestrial gamma radiation are going to be

presented in a forthcoming paper. The experiments have been carried out in the

Nuclear Physics Laboratory of the Department of Physics, University of Cyprus.

2. Materials and methods

2.1 Sample collection and preparation

A total number of 115 surface soil samples has been collected throughout the whole

accessible area of the Republic of Cyprus‡ (Fig. 1), which widely covered all the

geological surface formations of the island. More specifically, the official geological

map of Cyprus (GSDC, 1995) was used to segregate the accessible island’s area into

seven different geological regions indicated in the simplified map shown in Fig.1.

Ten to twenty-eight soil samples were collected from different locations falling

within the boundaries of each of the seven geological regions considered. Special

emphasis was given to the Troodos Ophiolitic Complex, from which more than half

(59) of the total number of samples was collected.

Samples were collected according to the internationally established experience. For

each soil sample collected, an area of about 0.5 m × 0.5 m was marked and carefully

cleared of debris to a few-centimeter depth. Surface soils were then taken from

different places randomly within the marked and cleared area and mixed together

thoroughly, in order to obtain a representative sample of that area. Each soil sample

was labeled according to the geographical coordinates of the sampling area, and those

coordinates were later used to draw a point

into the right position on the

corresponding simplified geological map shown in Fig. 1.

Collected soil samples were sieved through 0.2-mm mesh, hermetically sealed in

standard 1000 mL plastic Marinelli beakers

(assuming that

radioactivity is

homogeneously distributed in the whole volume of the measuring samples), dry-

by force since 1974 (see Fig. 1).

weighed and stored for about

four weeks prior

to counting. This allowed

establishment of equilibrium between 226Ra and 222Rn and its decay products,

although non-equilibrium is uncommon in rocks older than 106 years, and the 232Th

series may be considered in equilibrium in most geological environments (Chiozzi et

al., 2002).

2.2 Sample counting

Soil sample containers were placed into a shielded high-purity germanium (HPGe)

detector with an efficiency of 33%, relative to a 3″×3″ NaI(Tl) scintillator, and

measured for an accumulating time of 18 hours. A detailed description of the high-

resolution γ−ray spectrometry system, as well as of the measurement and analysis

techniques used in these investigations have been presented elsewhere (Tzortzis et al.,

2003). The naturally occurring radionuclides considered in the present analysis of the

measured γ−ray spectra are: 212Pb (with a main gamma energy at ∼239 keV and a

gamma yield of ∼43.1%), 214Pb (∼352 keV, ∼37.1%), 214Bi (∼609 keV, ∼46.1%),

228Ac (∼911 keV, ∼29%), and 40K (∼1461 keV, ∼10.7%). Since secular equilibrium

was reached between 232Th and 238U and their decay products, the concentration of

232Th was determined from the average concentrations of 212Pb and 228Ac in the

samples, and that of 238U was determined from the average concentrations of the 214Pb

and 214Bi decay products (Hamby and Tynybekov, 2000; Tzortzis et al., 2003). Thus,

an accurate radionuclide concentration of 232Th and 238U was obtained, whereas a

direct measurement of

40K concentration was achieved. Prior

to the sample

measurement, the environmental gamma-ray background at the laboratory site has

been determined using an empty Marinelli beaker under identical measurement

conditions. It has been later subtracted from the measured γ−ray spectra of each

sample.

6

The energy resolution (FWHM) achieved in the calibration measurements was 1.8

keV at the 1.33 MeV reference transition of 60Co. Depending on the peak background,

the Minimum Detectable Activity (MDA) was calculated to be 1.0×10−2 Bq kg−1 for

both 232Th and 238U, and 4.0×10−2 Bq kg−1 for 40K, for the counting time of 18 hours.

From these values, detection limits of 2.5×10−3 ppm, 8.1×10−4 ppm and 1.3 ppm were

derived, for thorium, uranium and potassium elemental concentrations, respectively.

2.3 Calculation of elemental concentrations

Following the spectrum analysis, count rates for each detected photopeak and activity

per unit mass (specific activity or radiological concentration) for each of the detected

nuclides are calculated (Tzortzis et al., 2003). Thus, for each sample studied the

specific activity concentrations, AE, of the 232Th, 238U and 40K radionuclides are

determined in units of Bq kg−1.

Radiological concentrations of 232Th, 238U and 40K were then converted into total

elemental concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively, according

to the following expression:

F
E

=

where FΕ is the fraction of element E in the sample, ΜΕ and λE are the atomic mass

(kg mol−1) and the decay constant

(s−1),

respectively, of

the corresponding

radionuclide considered (232Th,

238U, or

40K), ΝΑ is the Avogadro’s number

(6.023×1023 atoms mol−1), fA,E is the fractional atomic abundance of 232Th, 238U, or

40K in nature, C is a constant (with a value of 1,000,000 for Th and U or 100 for K)

that converts the ratio of the element’s to soil mass into ppm or into a percentage, and

AE is the calculated radiological concentration of 232Th, 238U or 40K (in Bq kg−1).

7

Hence, total elemental concentrations are reported in units of parts per million (ppm)

for thorium and uranium, and as a percentage (%) for potassium.

The total uncertainty of the radioactivity measurements, which is also applicable to

the extracted Th, U, and K elemental concentration values, was typically in the range

3−10%. It has been calculated by taking into consideration the counting statistical

error (∼3%) and weighted systematic errors that mainly included the uncertainty in

the efficiency calibration (0.5−8%).

In Table 1, mean values and the corresponding standard deviations (S.D.) of thorium,

uranium, and potassium elemental concentrations in soil samples are presented for the

geological regions considered in this study.

3. Results and discussion

The calculated elemental concentrations of thorium, uranium and potassium for the

115 samples collected from all over the island bedrock surface based on the different

lithological units of the study area are plotted in Fig. 2. As mentioned before, such a

number of collected samples in combination with the relatively large island area

portion permitted to study can be considered as a representative inventory of the

various outcropping geological formations. It can be clearly seen that higher values of

elemental concentrations are associated with formations of sedimentary origin

(regions R1, R2, R3 and R5) and lower values are associated with formations

belonging to the Troodos ophiolitic complex (regions R4, R6 and R7). In particular,

region R4, which covers the central part of the Troodos massif that contains basic and

ultrabasic plutonic rocks (see legend in Fig. 1), appears to present

the lowest

concentrations in Th, U and K.

8

Total concentrations of thorium ranged from 2.5×10−3 ppm to 9.8 ppm, from 8.1×10−4

ppm to 3.2 ppm for uranium, and from 1.3×10−4 % to 1.9 % for potassium. It should

be noted that the lower values given correspond to the detection limit derived for each

of the three elements, since some samples (mainly in the region R4) exhibited nearly

zero or even negative activity concentration after subtraction of

the ambient

background in the

laboratory site. Measured mean arithmetic

elemental

concentrations over all samples are: 1.2 ± 1.7 ppm, 0.6 ± 0.7 ppm and 0.4 ± 0.3 %, for

thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively, while revised median values obtained

worldwide are 7.4 ppm, 2.8 ppm, and 1.3 %, respectively. The latter mean values are

derived by transforming the corresponding worldwide average activity concentrations

of 30, 35, and 400 Bq kg−1 (UNSCEAR 2000 Report) for 232Th, 238U and 40K

radionuclides, into Th, U, and K elemental concentrations, respectively, using Eq. 1.

This result reveals that the mean total concentrations of the radioactive elements of

Th, U and K measured in the various geological formations in Cyprus are by a factor

of three to six lower than the corresponding values reported worldwide. Region 5,

which is mainly composed of calcarenites and sandstones, exhibit

the highest

concentrations in Th and K with mean values of 4.1 ± 2.3 ppm and 0.6 ± 0.3 %,

respectively, while Region 2, mainly composed of chalks, marls and gypsum, exhibits

the highest concentration in U with a mean of 1.8 ± 0.8 ppm. Although comparable

and within the range of some worldwide areas, the above presented highest mean

elemental concentrations of Th, U and K are still below the worldwide mean

concentrations derived from the corresponding specific activities reported in the

UNSCEAR 2000 Report.

For a more general and representative overview, Table 1 presents the averaged

concentrations for each one of the seven geological regions. It is clearly indicated that

9

the highest mean concentrations of Th, U and K were measured in soil samples

belonging to sedimentary formations, whereas the corresponding mean concentrations

associated with soils that stem from the Troodos ophiolitic complex are significantly

lower. To be more precise, the average concentration values of the elements thorium,

uranium, and potassium in soils of sedimentary origin ranged from 2.1 to 4.1 ppm

with a mean of 2.3 ± 2.0 ppm, from 0.8 to 1.8 ppm with a mean of 1.1 ± 0.7 ppm, and

from 0.4 to 0.6 % with a mean of 0.5 ± 0.3 %, respectively. The corresponding mean

elemental concentrations in soils of ophiolitic origin range from 8.0×10−2 to 4.4×10−1

ppm with a mean of 0.2 ± 0.3 ppm, from 3.7×10−2 to 2.0×10−1 ppm with a mean of 0.1

± 0.1 ppm, and from 9.2×10−2 to 5.2×10−1 % with a mean of 0.2 ± 0.2 %, respectively.

The frequency distribution for the whole dataset is presented in Fig. 3, while Fig. 4

summarizes the data for the mean concentrations of Th, U and K for each geological

formation studied.

The results presented in this paper are in general agreement with the first

measurements of activity and elemental concentrations of naturally occurring

radionuclides in twenty-eight samples from characteristic geological rock types of

Cyprus reported by Tzortzis et al. (2003). In that study, soil samples of sedimentary

composition appear again with higher mean elemental concentrations in the

radioisotopes of interest

than those exhibited by soils of ophiolitic origin as

following: 4.1 ± 0.9 ppm against 0.5 ± 0.1 ppm for thorium, 1.7 ± 0.4 ppm against 0.5

± 0.4 ppm for uranium, and 0.7 ± 0.1 % against 0.5 ± 0.2 % for potassium, for

samples of sedimentary and ophiolitic origin, respectively. Measured mean arithmetic

elemental concentrations over all samples were found to be 2.8 ± 0.7 ppm, 1.3 ± 0.3

ppm and 0.6 ± 0.1 %, for thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively. Comparison

10

between the results presented in this paper and those reported by Tzortzis et al. (2003)

is illustrated in Table 2.

Table 3 illustrates elemental concentration calculations derived from similar

investigations conducted in other countries worldwide. A survey study in surface soils

in more than 300 samples obtained from locations around the United States was

carried out by Myrick et al. (1983). The authors have determined arithmetic mean

concentrations and standard deviations of 8.9 ± 4.2 ppm and 3.0 ± 2.5 ppm, for

thorium and uranium, respectively. Kohman and Saito (1954) have estimated

potassium concentrations in a wide variety of rock types to range from approximately

0.1 to 3.5%. A more recent

investigation on different rock types at

the Alps-

Apennines transition was performed by Chiozzi et al. (2002), who have reported

elemental concentrations being in the range 0.3−16.7 ppm, 0.3−5.6 ppm, and

0.14−5.14 %, for thorium, uranium and potassium, respectively. Florou and Kritidis

(1992) reported gamma activities that correspond to elemental concentrations of 17.5

± 6.2 ppm for Th, 7.5 ± 3.8 ppm for U, and 2.9 ± 1.2 % for K, for a costal area in

Aegean Sea, Greece. Measurements of gamma activity performed by Karahan and

Bayulken (2000) in Istanbul, Turkey, have indicated mean elemental concentrations

of 9.1 ppm, 1.7 ppm, and 1.1 % for Th, U and K, respectively. Also, similar

measurements performed by Al-Jundi (2002) have shown concentrations that range

2.1 – 6.7 ppm for Th, 3.9 – 42.4 ppm for U, and 0.1 – 1.0 % for K. It is clear that the

corresponding elemental concentration values obtained from this study fall within the

lowest range of most reported values from other worldwide areas. In other words,

since natural radioactivity is directly related to the soil content in the radioactive

elements of Th, U, and K, the island of Cyprus can be considered as one of the world

areas that exhibit very low levels of natural radioactivity.

11

Verdoya at al. (2001) state that the original Th, U, and K concentrations in rocks may

vary because of alteration or metamorphic processes. Fig. 5 displays the Th/U, K/U,

and K/Th ratios, which may provide an indication whether relative depletion or

enrichment of radioisotopes had occurred. The best-fitting relation between Th and K

versus U is of linear type, with a correlation coefficient of 0.93 and 0.84, respectively.

The theoretically expected Th/U ratio for normal continental crust is about 3.0, while

the corresponding value obtained for this ratio is 2.04 ± 0.35, which is still close to

the expected value. Chiozzi et al. (2002) comment on this fact that it seems to

indicate that no significant fractionation during weathering or involvement

in

metasomatic activity of the radioelements had occurred. The K/U ratio has been

calculated to be equal to 0.28 ± 0.08, but it should be stated that this value is highly

variable (e.g. Roger and Adams, 1969). In the correlation between K and Th, the best-

fitting relation is again of linear type with a correlation coefficient of 0.90. The slope

in this case is 0.14 ± 0.03, which might be considered as close to the value of 0.25

reported by Chiozzi et al. (2002), and also close to the typical value obtained in a

large variety of unaltered rock formations by Galbraith and Saunders (1983).

4. Conclusions

High-resolution γ−ray spectrometry was used to determine total concentrations of the

radioactive elements of thorium, uranium, and potassium in a number of 115 surface

soil samples collected from all over the island of Cyprus. The number and the surface

distribution of the samples collected can be considered as a representative inventory

of the various outcropping geological formations. Soils originated from the Troodos

ophiolitic complex appear generally to have lower naturally occurring radionuclide

concentrations, compared to those of sedimentary origin. In the present study, mean

12

concentrations of 1.2 ppm, 0.6 ppm, and of 0.4 % for thorium, uranium and potassium

radioactive elements, respectively, are derived. These values fall within the lowest

range of those measured at worldwide scale by other authors and, more specifically,

are by a factor of three to six lower than the reported world average values of 7.4 ppm

(Th), 2.8 ppm (U) and 1.3% (K) in the UNSCEAR 2000 Report.

The results obtained from the present wide-range investigations are in general

agreement with the first studies on activity and elemental concentrations of naturally

occurring radionuclides and on their associated dose rates in various rock types

(Tzortzis et al., 2003). They further confirm that the dose rates due to naturally

occurring radiation in Cyprus are significantly lower (by a factor nearly of seven on

an average) than the corresponding radioactivity levels reported from other areas

worldwide.

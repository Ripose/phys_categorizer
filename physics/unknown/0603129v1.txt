In most of the cases, constraints, usually the conservation law of some extensive property, limit the possible changes described by the given physical theory, which leads to a shift of the functional derivative, governing the changes to first order, from its unconstrained form )(][xAδρρδ. That shift appears in the form of a Lagrange multiplier µ,       )(][)(][xCxAδρρδµδρρδ+ ,        (1) implicitly determined by the physical equation the functional derivative of ][ρA enters. For theoretical purposes and to reduce the extent of practical, mainly numerical, calculations, the need for an explicit coherent analytical treatment of "differentiational constants" µ arises. In [1,2], for a wide class of constraints,       fxdxK(())ρ∫=        (2) (where an explicit x-dependence of f is allowed as well, though not denoted for simplicity), an analytical formula for constrained derivatives Eq.(1) has been derived:    δρδρδρδρρρρδρδρAxAxfxKfxfxAxdxK[]()[]()(())(())(())[]()()()=−′′′′∫11 ,      (3) giving a treatment of functional differentiation under conservation constraints including the simple norm conservation Ndxx=∫)(ρ, the statistical physical constraints       Ldxxxg=∫)()(ρ ,        (4) or entropy conservation, Sdxxxk=−∫)(ln)(ρρ. However, the use of Eq.(3) is quite limited, being valid only for single, or at least, separate, constraints. In the physical areas where an explicit handling of constrained functional derivatives can be of particular relevance, there are more than one simultaneous conservation requirement constraining functional differentiation, as in statistical physics [3] or in the physics of complex systems, e.g., in liquid film dynamics [4,5], so the extension of the idea of the formula Eq.(3) is essential for a real physical use. In this paper, the generalization of Eq.(3) for functional differentiations under simultaneous K-conservation constraints will be set up.  In the case of two constraints of the form Eq.(4),      iiLdxxxg=∫)()(ρ    i=1,2,      (5) the route proposed in [1,2] to obtain a proper constrained differentiational formula can be followed. For that, an extension of )(21xLLρ of Eq.(5), ][21ρρLL, is needed, satisfying two conditions, namely, (i) reducing to )(21xLLρ for )(21xLLρ and (ii) fulfilling Eq.(5) for any )(xρ. That is a somewhat more difficult task than in the case of a single constraint; however, with the introduction of an arbitrary function )(xσ that integrates to zero, the extension  ∫∫∫∫′′′′′′′′′′′′′′′′−′′′=xdxxgxdxxgLxdxxgxgxgxxdxxgLxxLL)()()()()()()()(/)()()()()]([2111211121ρρσσρρρρ                     2121)()()()(/)(Lxdxxgxgxgx∫′′′′+σσ     (6) can be obtained, yielding     ′′′′−′′′−=∫∫∫xdxAxgxggLxdxAxLxAxALL)(][)()()(][)(1)(][)(][1122121δρρδσσδρρδρδρρδρδρδ                   ∫∫′′′′−xdxAxgxggxg)(][)()()(1122δρρδσσ .     (7)  For other K-conservation constraints, a route based on Sec.IV in [6] has to be followed.

Eq.(9) then yields two equations for the two differentiational constants:       02211=′+µµKK    (10a) and       02211=+′µµKK ,    (10b) with      ∫=′dxxfxfxfK))(())(())(()1(1)1(221ρρρ    (11a) and      ∫=′dxxfxfxfK))(())(())(()1(2)1(112ρρρ ,   (11b) giving  ∫′′′′′−′′′′−=xdxAxfxfKKxfxfKKKKK)(][))(())(())(())((1)/(11)1(2222)1(11121211δρρδρρρρµ  (12a) and  ∫′′′′′−′′′′−=xdxAxfxfKKxfxfKKKKK)(][))(())(())(())((1)/(11)1(1111)1(22221212δρρδρρρρµ  (12b) With Eq.(12), thus, the constrained differentiation formula for two simultaneous K-constraints:         2)1(21)1(1))(())(()(][)(][21µρµρδρρδρδρδxfxfxAxAKK−−= .    (13) Note that the formula Eqs.(12)-(13) cannot be applied for linear constraints, Eq.(4), because of a degenerance of them. For more than two simultaneous K-conservation constraints, similar routes can be followed as above.  References   [1] T. Gál, Phys. Rev. A 63, 022506 (2001).   [2] T. Gál, J. Phys.

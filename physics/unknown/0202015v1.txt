Structure of the Ga-stabilized GaAs(001)-c(8x2) surface has been studied using rocking-curve 

analysis of reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED).  The c(8x2) structure emerges 

at temperatures higher than 600°C, but is unstable with respect to the change to the (2x6)/(3x6) 

structure  at  lower  temperatures.    Our  RHEED  rocking-curve  analysis  at  high  temperatures 

revealed that the c(8x2) surface has  the  structure which is  basically the same as  that recently 

proposed by Kumpf et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 86, 3586 (2001)].  We found that the surface atomic 

configurations  are  locally  fluctuated  at  high  temperatures  without  disturbing  the  c(8x2) 

periodicity.

     The (001) surface of compound semiconductors, such as GaAs and InAs, shows a variety of 

reconstructions depending on the  processing  condition  and  the  resultant  surface  composition.  

The As-stabilized (2x4) surface of GaAs(001) has been most extensively studied, and is widely 
accepted to have the two As-dimer model (so-called É¿2 model).1  On the other hand, despite 

considerable efforts, no well-established model was proposed for the atomic structures of the 

Ga-stabilized surface of c(8x2).  The three Ga-dimer model [Fig. 1(a)] has been supported by 
the  I-V  curve  analysis  of  low-energy  electron  diffraction  (LEED),2  but  was  found  to  be 
energetically unstable.3  On the other hand, although it appears that the two-dimer model [Fig. 
1(b)]4  and  the  top  As-dimer  model  [Fig.  1(c)]5  are  consistent  with  scanning  tunneling 
microscopy (STM) images, both models failed in LEED test.2 

     Recent  studies  based  on  first-principles  calculations  have  altogether  changed  such  a 
situation:6  Lee,  Moritz,  and  Sheffler  proposed  the  Éƒ  model  [Fig.  1(d)]  which  explains  well 
LEED and STM data,6 and is also supported by x-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.7  A similar 

structure model shown in Fig. 1(e) has been proposed by an independent study on the basis of 
the XRD analysis using direct methods.8,9  The two models shown in Figs. 1(d) and 1(e) have 

basically the same atomic structures, but differ in the presence of Ga adatoms and in the partial 
absence of surface Ga-dimers in the latter model [Fig. 1(e)].8,9 

     Both  models  in  Figs.  1(d)  and  1(e)  explains  well  experimental  data  obtained  at  room 
temperature.6-9  However, as we will show later in this paper, the c(8x2) structure is stable only 

at temperatures higher than 600°C, but reversibly changes to the (2x6)/(3x6) structures as the 

temperature  is  decreased.    Thus,  in  order  to  study  the  actual  atomic  structure  of  the  c(8x2) 

surface  without  considering  possible  coexistence  of  other  phases,  structure  analysis  at  high 

temperatures is indispensable. 

     This  paper  reports  the  surface  structure  analysis  of  the  GaAs(001)-c(8x2)  at  high 

temperatures (> 600°C).  Rocking-curve analysis of reflection high-energy electron diffraction 
(RHEED)  based  on  dynamical  diffraction  theory10-13  has  been  used  for  this  purpose.    The 

results show that the GaAs(001)-c(8x2) has the structure model which is basically the same as 
that  proposed  by  Kumpf  et  al.8,9    However,  the  formation  of  surface  Ga-dimers  is  not 

necessarily favorable at high temperatures.

     The experiments were performed in a dual-chamber molecular-beam epitaxy system which 

is  equipped  with  an  x-ray  photoelectron  spectroscopy  and  a  STM  for  on-line  surface 

characterization.    Cleaned  GaAs(001)-(2x4)  surfaces  were  first  obtained  by  growing  an 

undoped  homoepitaxial  layer  (~0.5µm)  on  a  thermally  cleaned  GaAs(001)  substrate.    A 

detailed description of the apparatus and surface cleaning treatments for the GaAs(001)-(2x4) 
surface has been given in our previous papers.12  The sample was then transferred via ultra-high 

vacuum  (UHV)  transfer  modules  to  another  UHV  chamber,  where  surfaces  of  GaAs(001)-

c(8x2) were obtained by heating the GaAs(001)-(2x4) surfaces above 600°C without As fluxes.  

The RHEED rocking curves were measured at temperatures higher than 600°C, and at a base 
pressure of 5x10-11 Torr. 

     For RHEED rocking-curve measurements, the glancing angle of the incident electron beam 

(15 keV) was changed with intervals of ~0.04° using the extended beam rocking facility (Staib,

the intensities of symmetry-equivalent spots led to nine and three independent rocking curves 
for the [110] and [1 1 0] directions, respectively. 
     Intensities of RHEED were calculated by the multislice method proposed by Ichimiya.14  25

direction.  Fourier coefficients of the elastic scattering potential were obtained from the atomic 
scattering  factors  for  free  atoms  calculated  by  Doyle  and  Turner.15    A  correction  due  to 

condensation was made to fit the positions of bulk Bragg peaks at large glancing angles.  For 

instance,  the  resulting  mean  inner  potential  of  bulk  GaAs  was  13.6  eV.    The  Debye-Waller 
parameters were taken to be 1.70 Å2 and 1.47 Å2 for Ga and As atoms in bulk layers,16 while 

those for atoms in the surface bilayer were treated as fitting parameters.  In order to quantify 

 
3 

the agreement between the calculated rocking curves and the experimental ones, the  R factor 

defined in ref. 11 was used.  Details about the calculations were given in ref. 12. 

     When  the  GaAs(001)-(2x4)  surface  was  heated  above  450°C,  the  (2x4)  reflections 
the    [1 1 0]  direction.  

disappeared  and  1/6-order  spots  became  clearly  visible  along 

Simultaneously,  1/2-  and  1/3-order  streaks  begin  to  appear  in  the  RHEED  patterns  obtained 

along the [110] direction.  Our STM observations at room temperature have revealed that the 

surface  has  the  (2x6)/(3x6)  structure  at  this  stage.    As  the  temperature  is  increased  above 

~580°C  the  reflections  associated  with  a  c(8x2)  reconstruction  emerged  and  the  (2x6)/(3x6) 

reflections disappeared at ~600°C.  The c(8x2) structure is stable in the range of 600~640°C, 

beyond which the surface begins to roughen.  Here, we note that the surface at 600~640°C has 

the  c(8x2)  periodicity,  but  not  the  (4x2)  one:  the  1/4-order  spots  lying  on  a  semicircle,  the 

zeroth-order Laue zone, are clearly observed in the RHEED patterns obtained along the [110] 

direction.  On the other hand, spots are observed for the integral order reflections, but not for 
half-order  ones  along  the [1 1 0] direction.    Instead,  spots  are  clearly  visible  on  the  1/8-order 

Laue zone. 

     As the substrate temperature is decreased below 600°C, 1/6-order reflections appears in the 
RHEED  pattern  obtained  along  the [1 1 0] direction,  and  1/2-  and  1/3-order  streaks  begin  to 

coexist  with  the  1/4-order  spots  in  the  [110]-RHEED  patterns.    Our  STM  observations  have 

confirmed  that  the  c(8x2)  structure  was  partially  preserved  on  the  surface  only  when  the 

samples  were  quenched  from  600°C  to  room  temperature.    On  the  other  hand,  when  the 

substrate  temperature  is  gradually  decreased  below  ~550°C,  the  c(8x2)  structure  completely 

disappeared.  From these results, one may attribute the structural change to the adsorption of As 

molecules on the c(8x2) surface from residual gases.  However, since the present experiments 
were performed in a good UHV condition of ~5x10-11 Torr, we can rule out possible adsorption 

of As molecules.  Thus, these results prompted us to study the atomic structure of the c(8x2) 

surface at temperatures higher than 600°C. 

     Figure  2  shows  RHEED  rocking  curves  measured  from  the  GaAs(001)-c(8x2)  surface  at 

610°C  (solid  curves).    The  shape  of  these  curves  are  insensitive  to  the  change  in  substrate 

temperature  in  the  range  of  600  to  640°C.    Also  shown  in  Fig.  2  are  the  calculated  rocking

curves from the optimized structure model shown in Fig. 3, which is basically the same as that 

shown in Fig. 1(e).  The present analysis assumed that the surface relaxation extends no further 

than the third  atomic layer.    The  R  factor  for  the  optimized  model  is  0.104,  showing  a  good 

agreement  between  the  experiment  and  calculation.    On  the  other  hand,  the  Éƒ  model  [Fig. 

1(d)]  gives  a  larger R  factor of 0.154.    We  have  also  tested  other  structure  models  shown  in 
Figs. 1(a)-1(h).16  As shown in Fig. 4, most of structure models give R factors larger than 0.25, 

even after the structure optimization. 

     The  structure  parameters  of  the  optimized  model  (Fig.  3)  are  listed  in  Table  I  with  errors 

evaluated from the half width of the range where R factor is smaller than 1.1xRmin.  Comparing 

the atomic coordinates obtained by the present analysis and those in ref. 9, a good agreement is 

found  between  them.    In  addition,  the  site  occupancies  (É∆)  for  Ga  adatoms  [Ga(1)]  and 

surface  Ga-dimer  [Ga(2)]  are  0.27±0.09  and  0.47±0.13,  respectively,  which  are  close  to  the 
corresponding  values  obtained  by  XRD  analysis.8,9    The  reduced  site  occupancy  of  Ga(2) 

suggest that the atomic arrangement without Ga(2) atoms locally exists on the c(8x2) surface, 

but further studies are needed to examine the stability of such a local structure. 

     As seen in Table I, the atomic coordinates of Ga(1) and Ga(2) atoms have relatively large 

errors in the [110] direction.  This is not due to a small data set in this direction, because other 

atoms, such as As(1), Ga(5) and Ga(6), have much smaller errors.  On the other hand, when in-

plane anisotropies in the Debye-Waller parameters were taken into account in the analysis, we 
found that the vibrational amplitudes of Ga(1) are 0.32 Å and 0.19 Å in the [110] and [1 1 0] 

directions, respectively.  Thus, the present result show that Ga(1) atoms are weakly bonded to 

the  surface  and  are  in  uncertain  positions  in  the  [110]  direction.    This  is  consistent  with  the 

recent first-principles calculations showing that the existence of Ga(1) adatom is energetically 
unstable.7 

     The  large  errors  in  the  Ga(2)  position  can  be  correlated  with  the  following  analysis.    We 

have calculated RHEED intensities for the structure model in which Ga(2) atoms do not form 

dimers.  This model arrived at an R factor of 0.106, for which the amount of Ga(2) atoms in a 

c(8x2) unit cell is 0.84 (É∆=0.42).  In addition, when the amount of Ga(2) atoms is in the range 

of 0.84~0.94, the model revealed clear minimum in an R factor of 0.10~0.11, irrespective of 

 
5 

their  atomic  coordinate  in  the  [110]  direction.    While  such  a  random  positioning  of  Ga(2) 

atoms  results  in  the  (4x1)  periodicity  in  the  outermost  layer,  the  subsurface  dimerization  of 

Ga(6) produces the c(8x2) periodicity.  From these results, we conclude that the formation of 

Ga(2) dimers is not necessarily favorable at a high temperature of 610°C [20]. Considering that 

the local structure without Ga(2) atoms can also exist on the GaAs(001)-c(8x2) surface at high 

temperatures,  it  seems  reasonable  to  consider  that  thermally-activated  Ga(2)  atoms  migrate 

along the [110] direction, changing their local atomic configurations. 

     In  conclusion,  we  have  studied  the  surface  structure  of  GaAs(001)-c(8x2)  at  high 

temperatures.  The c(8x2) structure obtained by heating the (2x6)/(3x6) surface above 600°C is 

stable  at  600~640°C,  but  reversibly  changes  to  the  (2x6)/(3x6)  surface  as  the  temperature  is 

decreased  below  600°C.    We  performed  RHEED  rocking-curve  analysis  above  600°C  and 

confirmed that the c(8x2) surface has the structure model proposed by Kumpf et al.  The results 

suggest  that  surface  Ga  atoms  are  thermally  activated  at  high  temperatures  and  dynamically 

change their local atomic configurations without disturbing the c(8x2) symmetry.

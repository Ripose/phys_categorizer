In this study the amount of “informal” citations (i.e. those mentioning only author 
names or their initials instead of the complete references) in comparison to the 
“formal” (full reference based) citations is analyzed using some pioneers of chemistry 
and physics as examples. The data reveal that the formal citations often measure 
only a small fraction of the overall impact of seminal publications. Furthermore, 
informal citations are mainly given instead of (and not in addition to) formal citations. 
As a major consequence, the overall impact of pioneering articles and researchers 
cannot be entirely determined by merely counting the full reference based citations. 
 
,QWURGXFWLRQ(cid:3)
 
The number of citations is often taken as a measure of the resonance or impact an 
article, a researcher or a research institute has generated up to a given date. 
Although the citation based impact cannot be taken as the final importance and 
quality of articles, citation data give evidence for strengths and shortcomings and 
therefore are frequently used for research evaluation involving individuals, 
institutions or even countries. Being cited means that a given publication (mostly a 
journal article, but sometimes also a publication from another document type such as 
a book or conference proceedings) appears as footnote or reference in the 
publication of another author, who refers to it for additional reading. The number of 
citations is seen to be a rough measure of the importance of the specific publication 
within the scientific community. 
 
Citing is afflicted to a greater or lesser extent by many distortions, which have been 
widely discussed in the bibliometric literature [1]. However, one specific bias leading 
in some cases to a substantial loss of the citation based impact has not been 
quantified until present: the amount of “informal” citations (i.e. those mentioning only 
names or their initials instead of the complete references) in comparison to the 
“formal” (full reference based) citations. In the present study some prominent 
pioneers in physics and chemistry, and common name based items out of their 
research disciplines, are analyzed, in particular concerning the relation of their formal 
to informal citations.

The data presented here are predominantly based on the Science Citation Index 
(SCI) under the Web of Science (WoS), the search platform provided by the 
producer: Thomson Scientific (the former Institute for Scientific Information, ISI). In 
addition, the database SCISEARCH (SCI under STN), the literature file (CAPLUS) of 
the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) of the American Chemical Society and the 
Physics Abstracts file (INSPEC) have been consulted under the host STN 
International. The CAS file covers both chemistry and physics (physics, however, 

 

2 

being completely covered only until around 1960) whereas the INSPEC file covers 
mainly physics, with some closely connected disciplines like electronics and 
computer science included. The SCI under the WoS, as well as the INSPEC file and 
the CAS literature file under STN International, stretch back to 1900. The SCI under 
STN covers only the time period from 1974 until present. 
 
The Web of Science offers two basic search modes: The General Search mode and 
the Cited Reference Search mode. The General Search mode reveals publications in 
the SCI “source journals” (no books, no popular publications, no conference 
proceedings unless they appear in source journals). The about 6000 SCI “source 
journals” selected by the staff of Thomson/ISI as contributing to the progress of 
science represent only about 10 percent of the total world wide scientific literature, 
but are the dominating part [2]. The informal citations determined in this study are 
based both on the SCI searched under the WoS, on the CAS literature file CAPLUS 
and on the INSPEC file, both searched under STN International. All articles 
mentioning a specific name in the title, the abstract or as a keyword were considered 
and selected according to their year of publication. In contrast to the CAS and 
INSPEC file, the SCI (under WoS as well as STN) does not include the abstracts of 
articles published before 1991, limiting the time period of SCI informal citations which 
include abstracts to the time period 1991 till present. 
 
The Cited Reference Search mode enables access to all references appeared in SCI 
source journals, whether the references are to articles in source journals (cited either 
correctly or incorrectly), or references to books or any other published material (e.g. 
theses, internal reports, or even private communications). By this method, the time-
dependent number of citing articles (source items only) related to works of a specific 
author can be determined. Due to the WoS system limitations under the Cited 
Reference Search mode (10 pages with 500 items at maximum), the number of citing 
papers of some prominent pioneers (e.g. Albert Einstein) could only be determined till 
1973 and was completed with respect to the time period 1974 until present by 
searching the SCI under STN International (using the reference author search field).

The fundamental ideas of science soon find their way into textbooks. Then they 
are often taken for granted and scientists usually do no longer refer to the original 
articles. They only mention the names or the name-based items instead of the full 
formal references. This can be demonstrated with the impact data of Albert 
Einstein. The contributions of Einstein to physics are well known. His works on 
quantum physics and relativity are outstanding and unique. Einstein formulated the 
special and general theories of relativity and, in addition, he made significant 
contributions to quantum theory, statistical mechanics, and solid state physics. He 
is widely regarded as one of the greatest physicists ever. While best known for the 
Theory of Relativity, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics for “his 
discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect”. 
 
The time dependent number of formal citations (references to the works of Albert 
Einstein) versus informal citations (“Einstein”, “relativity”, “relativistic” appearing in 
the titles, the abstracts or the keywords) was established by the procedure 
mentioned above. The graphs of this study express the formal citations as number 

 

3 

of citing papers per year - instead of citations per year (see Figure 1). Please note 
that one citing paper may comprise more than one citation (e.g. one citing paper 
refers to more than one Einstein article). The citing papers compare well to the 
informal citations, because in both cases citations are counted only once per 
paper.

)LJXUH(cid:3)(cid:20)(cid:29) Time dependent number of formal citations related to the works of Albert 
Einstein versus informal citations (“Einstein”, “relativity” or “relativistic” appearing in 
the titles, the abstracts or the keywords). Source: CAS literature file and INSPEC 
file under STN International and Thomson/ISI Web of Science (WoS). 
 
Concerning Einstein, we found altogether more than 18,000 citing papers comprising 
about 30,000 formal citations within the time period 1900 until the end of 2005. 
During the same time there are almost 80,000 informal citations in the CAS file and 
more than 120,000 informal citations in the INSPEC file related to Einstein, based on 
the search terms “Einstein”, “relativity” or “relativistic” appearing in the titles, abstracts 
or keywords (see Tables 1 and 2). Almost 30,000 informal citations are based on the 
titles only. From 1960 till 2005 the informal citations have outrun the formal citations 
by a factor of almost six (see Table 1). The CAS literature file covers more journals 
than SCI (see larger number of articles since the year 2000) but does not cover the 
complete physics literature after about 1960 (see the lower number of informal 
citations 1990-2000). We have collected the number of informal citations of Einstein 
and of the other examples so obtained and discussed in this study in Tables 1 and 2. 
 
Some authors include full references in the abstract text. The amount of this 
practice (not accepted by some journal editors) was checked here with the famous 
article by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) published 1935 (the most often 

 

4 

cited paper of Einstein - almost 3000 citations until present). Only 4 papers 
mentioned the EPR paper in the abstract (see the following WoS example). All 
these articles cited, in addition, the actual article as formal reference.

Google and Google Scholar have become additional powerful WEB-search 
resources that we have not discussed so far. Searching the WEB for “Einstein” 
with Google results in the overwhelming number of 67 million entries, while Google 
Scholar results in 0.5 million hits (see Table 3). The Google searches were carried 
out without any limitations concerning format, language, and time. 
 
We have analyzed some other pioneers of quantum physics with respect to formal 
versus informal citations: Erwin Schrödinger achieved fame for his contributions to 
quantum mechanics, especially the Schrödinger equation, for which he received 
the Nobel Prize in 1933. Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac pioneered the theory of the 
relativistic electron. He formulated the so-called Dirac equation, which led to the 
prediction of the existence of antimatter. Dirac shared the Nobel Prize in physics 
for 1933 with Erwin Schrödinger. 
 
Schrödinger’s informal citations result mainly from mentioning the Schrödinger 
equation, which has become what is probably the most fundamental mathematical 
contribution to quantum physics. His formal citations are only about 20 percent of the 
informal ones, which outrun the formal citations since 1960 (see Figure 2). In contrast 
to Schrödinger, both citation versions related to Dirac are equal until around 1980 
(see Figure 3). In the last three decades, however, Dirac’s informal citations have 
exceeded the formal citations by almost a factor of two.

P.A.M. Dirac versus informal citations (“Dirac” appearing in the titles, the abstracts 
or the keywords). 
 
Another early pioneer is Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman, an Indian physicist 
who was awarded the 1930 Nobel Prize in Physics for his experimental discovery of 
the inelastic scattering of light, now generally known as Raman effect. The widely 
used Raman spectroscopy is based on this phenomenon. Widespread use of this 
experimental technique after the introduction of the laser in 1962 resulted in a 
strongly increasing number of informal citations with more than 8000 papers in the 
year 2005 (see Figure 4). The number of formal citations, however, remained 
constant at a level of about 50 citations per year for decades, which amounts to only 
about half a percent of the articles mentioning Raman’s name (see Tables 1 and 2). 
 
Until the year 2005 the overall number of formal citations to Raman’s work is about 
2200, whereas informal citations have reached almost 150,000 based on the CAS file 
and about 90,000 based on the INSPEC file. More than 50,000 articles with Raman’s 
name appearing in the titles were published in the journals covered by the SCI. The 
overwhelming number of informal citations in combination with the large ratio of 
informal to formal citations indicates that Raman soon became a household word 
after the discovery of his effect. 
 
Most of these citations (formal as well as informal) are related to the Raman effect 
(Raman spectroscopy, Raman scattering) [3,4]. Raman spectroscopy has become a 
standard powerful experimental technique with widely available commercial 
instrumentation. It finds applications in physics, chemistry, mineralogy, engineering, 
biology, environmental sciences, pharmacy, and medicine. At the same time it is a 
very fruitful field of basic research, both theoretical and experimental. A biannual 
series of an international and interdisciplinary conference is devoted to this field (the 
last one, ICORS 20, has just been held in August 2006 in Yokohama, with a 
participation of about 650 scientists). 
 
At this point one should mention, however, that the effect was independently 
discovered almost simultaneously with Raman by Landsberg and Mandelstam in 
Moscow [5] (the priority is disputed; in the Russian literature Raman scattering is 
referred to as “combination scattering” - according to WoS combination scattering 
has been cited informally 324 times). In spite of Raman’s priority concerning the 
experimental discovery of the effect, the Austrian scientist A. Smekal predicted it on 
theoretical grounds as far back as 1923 [6]. Hence, sometimes one finds in the 
literature informal citations to the Smekal-Raman effect. The Smekal article [6] has 
been cited formally about 100 times. The fact that most citations to Smekal’s 
prediction are formal indicates that “Smekal” did not become a household word. 
 
Because of the widespread use of Raman scattering we searched the WEB using 
Google: We obtained almost 14 million entries for “Raman” and 1,640,000 entries for 
“Raman Scattering” (see Table 3). Under “Smekal Raman” we found only about 500 
Google hits.

abstracts or the keywords). 
 
Another widely used spectroscopic technique, closely related to Raman 
spectroscopy, is Brillouin spectroscopy. It was predicted by Leon Brillouin just before 
the beginning of WW I [7]. Brillouin has been cited informally almost 19,000 times as 
opposed to about 6000 formal citations within the time period 1900 until the end of 
2005. Of the informal citations 18,700 simply refer to Brillouin, about 7000 to Brillouin 
zone, a most important concept when dealing with spatially periodic systems, about 
6500 refer to Brillouin scattering and almost 500 to Brillouin spectroscopy. Most 
informal citations refer to the Brillouin effect (plus scattering and spectroscopy), 
however, about 5400 informal citations refer to the WKB method to solve the 
Schrödinger equation, to be discussed later. 
 
Although Brillouin scattering was predicted by Brillouin in 1914 [7], its discovery (by 
E. Gross in Leningrad) had to wait till 1930 [8]. At that time the observation of the 
Brillouin effect with extant incoherent light sources was a real “tour de force” and 
Brillouin spectroscopy had to wait till the advent of the laser in order to reach its full 
capabilities. The laser, together with multipass Fabry Perot spectrometers, brought 
Brillouin spectroscopy to its full capabilities around 1970, making the name of 
Brillouin also a household word. Since about 1965 the informal citations to Brillouin 
outrun the formal citations, exceeding the formal citations by a factor of about four 
(see Figure 5). The Brillouin article has been cited formally almost 200 times.

Informal citations sometimes comprise names in combination with terms like 
“approximation”, “equation”, “law”, “theory”, “spectroscopy” etc. as complex items. 
Such informal citations named after two or more researchers usually appear as 
acronyms. A typical example is the BCS theory (named for its creators: Bardeen, 
Cooper, and Schrieffer) [9,10]. This work, a breakthrough in theoretical solid state 
physics, explains conventional superconductivity, i.e. the ability of certain metals to 
conduct electricity at low temperatures without electrical resistance. The key idea is 
that electron phonon coupling results in an attractive interaction leading to bound 
electron pairs (so-called Cooper pair(s), which also appear as informal citations). 
 
Whereas the 1957 article by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer [9] contains the full 
mathematical development of the BCS theory, the formation of Cooper pairs had 
already been predicted a year earlier in an article with L.N. Cooper as sole author 
[10]. This article has been formally cited almost 500 times whereas the total number 
of informal citations of “Cooper pair(s)” according to INSPEC is 4000. If we confine 
ourselves to the title words of articles covered by the SCI we find “Cooper pair(s)” 
informally cited about 400 times. 
 
The formal citations of the BCS paper published 1957 (almost 5000 citations till 
present) peaked some years after the publication and then decreased slowly (see 
Figure 6). Since the discovery of the high-temperature superconductivity in the year 

 

9 

1986 by Bednorz and Mueller [11], the BCS paper has been formally cited at a nearly 
constant rate of about 120 citations per year (except for a weak jump around 1987). 
The informal citations, however, increased strongly since the BCS discovery, 
exceeding altogether more than 10,000 until the year 2005 (see Table 1). Only a 
minor fraction of them contains the original BCS paper as a full reference.

A typical example for a method or theory not named after its creators is the Density 
Functional Theory (DFT). This is a quantum mechanical algorithm used in physics 
and chemistry to simplify the investigation of the electronic structure of many-body 
systems, in particular molecules and condensed phases. DFT is among the most 
popular and versatile methods available in condensed matter physics and 
computational chemistry. For his development of the “density-functional theory” 
Walter Kohn was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. 
 
The original DFT paper by Kohn and Sham [12] has been cited almost 12,000 times 
until present and is thereby one of the most-cited articles in either chemistry or 
physics. In contrast to the usual citation time pattern, this paper has not yet reached 
its peak but has continued to increase its impact monotonically with time. 
Nevertheless, since the year 1993 the informal citations outrun the formal citations 
exceeding about 7000 citations in the year 2005 (see Figure 7). The overall number 
of informal citations in the CAS file within the time period 1965 till 2005 is around 
40,000 (see Table 1).

and then reached a constant level of 60 formal citations until present. The QHE 
informal citations in the CAS and the SCI file, however, increased until the year 1998 
then leveling off to the large number of about 400 citations per year (see Figure 8).

Moore's law is the empirical observation that the complexity and/or density of 
integrated circuits, with respect to component cost, doubles every 18 months. It is 
attributed to Gordon E. Moore, a co-founder of the Intel company. Moore's original 
statement can be found in his publication entitled "Cramming more components onto 
integrated circuits" [15]. It is interesting that the formal citations still outdo the informal 
ones (see Figure 9). However, the law is sometimes paraphrased without mentioning 
it exactly as “Moore's law” (e.g. “Moore's prediction”).

Schrödinger's cat is a seemingly paradoxical thought experiment 
(Gedankenexperiment), devised by Erwin Schrödinger, which attempts to illustrate 
the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. The original article appeared in the 
German magazine Naturwissenschaften [16-18]. It was intended as a discussion of 
the EPR article published by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in the same year. The 
number of formal citations at least equals the number of informal citations based on 
the SCI and the INSPEC file. (see Figure 10). Like Moore's law, Schrödinger's cat 
may also be paraphrased and thus not be fully covered by this search.

In theoretical physics, the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, also 
known as WKBJ approximation (J stands for Jeffreys), or a permutation of those four 
letters, is the most familiar example of a semi-classical calculation in quantum 
mechanics in which the wave function is recast as an exponential function, semi-
classically expanded, and then either the amplitude or the phase is taken to be slowly 
varying in space. It represents an expansion of the wave function. This method is 
named after physicists Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin, who developed it in the year 
1926 [19-21]. In 1924, mathematician Harold Jeffreys had already developed a 
general method of finding approximate solutions to linear, second-order differential 
equations, which include the Schrödinger equation [22]. But since the Schrödinger 
equation was developed two years later, and Wentzel, Kramers, and Brillouin were 
apparently unaware of this earlier work, Jeffreys is often not given proper credit. 
Articles in quantum mechanics contain any number of combinations of the three or 
four initials. 
 
At the date of our WKBJ search (14.09.06) 425 articles cited at least 1 of the 4 
original papers as a full reference - only 40 articles cited all 4 paper simultaneously. 
The number of informal citations of the WKBJ approximation is about 5400 (see 
Table 1). Out of these informally citing papers 80 articles cited simultaneously at least 
1 of the 4 original papers - only 14 articles cited simultaneously all 4 original papers. 
The informal citations strongly increased since 1960 reaching at present 200 citations 
per year (see Figure 11).

The Doppler effect, named after Christian Andreas Doppler, is the change in 
frequency and/or wavelength of a wave that is perceived by an observer moving 
relative to the source of the waves. For waves such as sound waves, which 
propagate in a material medium, the effect depends on whether the source or the 
observer move with respect to the propagation medium. In the case of light, 
according to relativity theory the effect depends on the relative velocity of observer 
and medium. Christian Andreas Doppler, born in Salzburg (Austria) in 1803, occupied 
several minor academic positions till he was appointed professor of geometry and 
mathematics at the Polytechnical School of Prague in 1841. Most of his publications 
are nearly forgotten, except for that in which he predicted the effect that bears his 
name [23]. He developed the theory of his effect in order to explain the color of 
double stars related to their rotation around each other. The color of the star that 
approaches the observer should be blue shifted, that of the one, which moves away, 
should be red shifted. 
 
We have only found in the WoS about 100 formal citations to the report in which the 
Doppler effect was first published [23]. Figure 12 displays the informal citations to 
“Doppler” as obtained under the SCI (as of 1990 so as to include abstracts) and of 
INSPEC (going back to 1990 with abstracts included). Doppler was cited informally 

 

15 

more than 80,000 times according to the SCI file and almost 47,000 times according 
to INSPEC. As often the case in previous examples, the number of citations took off 
around 1950, reaching the amount of 1200 per year in 1990 according to INSPEC 
and almost 5000 per year according to the SCI. 
 
It is interesting to compare in the case of Doppler the INSPEC informal citation data 
with the SCI data after 1991 (see Figure 12). The latter are about 2.5 times higher 
than the former. The explanation of this difference is in fact mainly due to the fact that 
the SCI includes medical literature. Doppler became a household word among 
medical personnel shortly after 1973, in connection with the invention and 
development of Doppler sonography, a technique that allows the noninvasive 
observation of the circulation of blood in the main blood vessels [24]. The term 
“Doppler sonography” first appears in the SCI as informal citation in 1973 (2 times), 
rising rapidly and reaching about 350 in 2005. Beside Green’s function (see below) 
Doppler shows the largest ratio of informal to formal citations (see Tables 1 and 2).

Informal citations are rather widespread for publications dating back to the early days 
of science. Very often, the journals to be cited are not readily available but scientists 
know the name and subject of the work, which propagates from one article to the 
next without mentioning the precise (formal) source. As an example, we discuss 
George Green, a Miller from Nottingham, who in 1828 published an article where he 
introduced the Green function, sometimes mentioned as Green’s function, as a tool 
for solving differential equations. The original work appeared in 1828 in a rather 

 

16 

obscure publication of the Nottingham Subscription Library with the Title “An Essay 
on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and 
Magnetism” [25]. 
 
Such complicated titles are prone to formal citation errors. Indeed we find a total of 
only 30 formal citations to Green’s original paper with the source involving several 
permutations of the title above. When looking at the informal citations (see Figure 13) 
one must take into account that they appear under either Green function or Green’s 
function (the more frequent version) and that one must accumulate the singular and 
the plural of the word “function”. The number of informal citations is overwhelming 
(see Tables 1 and 2), especially considering the fact that they reflect a single 
publication which has been formally cited only 29 times (probably because of the 
unavailability of such an obscure publication).

Harry Dember, born in 1882 in Mansfeld (Thuringia) is best known for the discovery 
of the “Dember effect” as reported in three articles in the Physikalische Zeitschrift [26-
28]. The first of these articles [26] describes the observation of the effect on natural 
cuprite (Cu2O), at that time a canonical semiconducting material. The effect is seen 
as a voltage, which appears along the direction of light incident on one of the sample 
faces. Dember interpreted the effect as due to the electrons excited by the absorbed 
light (it has been realized later that the Dember effect involved the diffusion of 

 

17 

electrons as well as holes). The other two articles [27-28] report experiments 
performed to demonstrate that the effect is a volume effect and not an effect resulting 
from charge separation at blocking layers or other inhomogeneities. Photovoltaic 
effects known at that time had been shown to be related to such layers. 
 
In 1923, Dember was appointed professor of physics at the university of Dresden. He 
had till then published 13 papers in SCI source journals which to date have not 
received much attention (a total of 24 citations only). His major contribution is the 
discovery of the Dember effect appearing 1931 in the Physikalische Zeitschrift [26] 
(144 formal citations) and in the two additional articles appeared in 1931 and 1932 
[27-28] (75 and 83 citations). His career as an author ended in 1933 with his 
emigration first to Istanbul, in order to escape Nazi persecution, followed by the 
acceptance, in 1942, of a lectureship at Rutgers University in the USA, where he 
passed away in 1943 [29]. His three major contributions have been cited rather 
regularly at the average rate of about 6 times per year until present. 
 
Since these publications were written in German and appeared in a journal not easily 
available during WW II and even today, it is interesting to investigate the informal 
citations this work has received. At the date of our search (14.11.06) the word 
“Dember” appears in titles and abstracts of SCI source articles 135 times, of which 86 
correspond to “Dember effect”, 26 to “Dember field”, 6 to “Dember model” and 21 to 
“photo-Dember”. In the case of Dember, only 20 % of the informally citing articles 
give also a formal citation to one of the three papers under discussion in connection 
with the Dember effect [26-28]. This example shows that even in the case of low 
profile authors, with only a few highly cited contributions, informal citations (135 in 
SCI and 331 in INSPEC) contribute considerably to his impact and must be taken into 
account when determining either the author’s impact or that of his main publications. 
 
In most cases studied here the number of informal citations based on the SCI 
within the time period 1991 till 2005 (with the abstracts included) compares well 
with those based on the CAS literature file and the INSPEC file. The difference 
between the CAS and the INSPEC file results mainly from the incomplete 
coverage of chemistry under the INSPEC file (see DFT and Raman) and of 
physics (since around 1960) under the CAS file (see Einstein, Schrödinger, and 
WKBJ). The somewhat larger numbers based on the CAS and the INSPEC file as 
compared with those under the SCI file is most likely due to the fact that the SCI 
(under the General Search mode) only reports citations appearing in source 
articles within the selected SCI source journals. The decrease of informal citations 
since 2003 based on the INSPEC file is presumably caused by delayed input in 
comparison to the SCI. Note also that the long-lasting exponential growth of 
science has brought about a large excess of weight concerning more recent 
literature: The records covered both by the SCI and the CAS file increased 
approximately by a factor of hundred within the 20th century. 
 
Tables 1 and 2 summarize the impact data shown above. The tables include some 
additional names not presented with the detailed time curves of their impact. Please 
note that the informal citations given in Table 1 are based on the INSPEC file instead 
of the SCI file as in Table 2. For comparison and completeness, we have displayed in 
Table 3 informal citation data searched under Google and Google Scholar.

The number of informal citations is often many times higher than the number of 
formal citations, especially when the name of an author or his contributions have 
become household words. This is also the case, when work appeared in old, 
obscure, or not easily available journals. Hence, the formal citations measure only a 
fraction of the (measurable) overall impact of seminal papers or pioneer authors like 
those presented here. Only a small fraction of the total number of the citing papers 
(formal plus informal citations) cite simultaneously the full reference and the author’s 
name. Thus, informal citations are mainly carried out instead of (and not in addition 
to) formal citations. As a major consequence, citation rankings of pioneers may be 
greatly misleading. The overall impact of pioneering articles cannot be entirely 
determined by merely counting their citations.

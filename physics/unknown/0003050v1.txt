INTRODUCTION

Bose-Einstein condensates1-3 are very promising for atom optics4-6, where
they are expected to play a role as important as lasers in photon optics, since
they are coherent sources of atoms with a very large luminosity. In view of
applications, it is crucial to develop apparatuses that produce BEC faster  -
the  average  production  rate  of  a  condensate  is  0.01  Hz  -  and  with  more
versatile  designs,  by  reducing,  for  example,  the  power  consumption  of  the
electromagnets.

For this purpose, we have developed a magnetic trap for atoms based on
an  iron  core  electromagnet,  in  order  to  avoid  the  large  currents,  electric
powers, and high pressure water cooling, required in schemes using simple
coils. The latest developments allow us to achieve a very high confinement
that will permit to achieve much higher production rates.

In  this  chapter,  we  will  first  present  the  design  of  the  iron  core
electromagnet and how to solve the specific experimental problems raised by
this technique. After presenting the experimental set-up, we will address the
interruption of runaway evaporative cooling when the Zeeman effect  is  not
negligible  compared  to  the  hyperfine  structure.  We  will  then  present  two
ways  to  circumvent  this  problem:  use  of  multiple  RF  frequencies  and

sympathetic  cooling.  Another  method,  hyperfine  evaporation,  was  used  in
Ref.  2.  In  conclusion,  we  will  present  some  applications  of  these  high
magnetic fields.

IRON-CORE ELECTROMAGNET TRAP FOR
ATOMS

Our  iron-core  electromagnet  is  shown  Fig.2.  It  follows  the  scheme  of
Tollett  et  al.7.  Instead  of  using  permanent  magnets,  we  use  pure  iron  pole
pieces excited by coils, which allows us to vary the trap configuration. The
use  of  ferromagnetic  materials  was  reported  in Ref.8  .The  role  of  the  pole
pieces is to guide the magnetic field created by the excitation coils far away
from the center of the trap towards the tips of the poles. To understand this
effect, let us consider the magnetic circuit represented Fig. 1.

Figure 1. a) System of two anti-Helmholtz coils of excitation NI separated by e. b) Equivalent
magnetic circuit. l: length of the ensemble poles + yoke. e: gap between the tips.

The  two  tips  are  separated  by  a  gap  e  of  a  few  centimeters.  The
ferromagnetic  structure  has  a  total  length  l  and  a  section  S.  The  whole
structure is excited by a coil of 2N loops driven by a current  I, leading to an
excitation 2NI. From the Ampere's theorem9, we can introduce the reluctance

In our case, the gap  e and the size of the ferromagnets  l are comparable.
Since mr is very important (mr > 104) for ferromagnetic materials, only the gap
contribution is importanti. A more complete calculation shows that the field
created in the gap is similar to that created with two coils of excitation  NI
placed close to the tips as represented10 Fig. 1. Thus, guiding of the magnetic
field created by arbitrary large coils far away from the rather small trapping
volume  is  achieved.  All  this  demonstration  is  only  valid  if  a  yoke  links  a
north pole to a south pole. If not, no guiding occurs and the field in the gap is
significantly reduced.

We  will  focus  now  on  our  Ioffe-type  trap  for  Rubidium  87  (Fig.  2),
which  consists  of  a  superposition  of  a  linear  quadrupole  field  and  dipole
field. The linear quadrupole field of gradient  G is produced by two pairs of
coils  in  an  anti-Helmholtz  configuration,  along  the  x- and  y-axis,  and  the

leading to an anisotropic axial harmonic potential for trapping states, in the
linear Zeeman effect regime.

The use of ferromagnetic materials raises several problems:
Geometry. As mentioned previously, a ferromagnetic yoke has to link a
north pole to a south pole. A bad coupling between two poles can result in
reduced  performances  of  the  electromagnet.  Our  solution  shown  Fig.  2
optimizes  the  optical  access  around  the  vacuum  cell  while  keeping  the
required coupling efficient.

In addition, the geometry of the magnetic field relies on the shape of the
pole pieces rather than the geometry of the exciting coils. This results in the
fact that the bias field  B0 cannot be easily decreased without also canceling
the dipole curvatureii C. This implies a high bias field, for which the Zeeman
shift  is  no  longer  linear  in  the  magnetic  field,  due  to  a  contamination
between  hyperfine  levels.  In  fact,  a  more  complicated  design  of  the  poles
along  the  z-axis  allows  for  canceling  the  bias  field  while  keeping  an
important  dipole  curvature.  This  new  design  will  be  discussed  in  the  last
section of this chapter.

Hysteresis.  Hysteresis  prevents  from  returning  to  zero  magnetic  field
after having switched ON and OFF the electromagnet. A remanent field of a
few Gauss remains, as shown Fig. 3.

This remanent magnetization needs to be cancelled in order, for example,
to release the atoms and make a velocity (temperature) time-of-flight (TOF)
measurement. Extra coils around the magnetic poles (see Fig. 4), carrying a
DC current will shift the hysteresis cycle so that it crosses zero again. The
current  is  adjusted  to  provide  the  coercive  excitation  which  cancel  exactly
the  remanent  magnetic  field  when  the  large  coils  are  switched  off.  This
compensation  is  valid  as  long  as  we  remain  on  the  same  excitation  cycle.
This stability is achieved thanks to a computer control of the experiment.

ii In the systems using coils, an additional compensation coils is used the reduce the bias field.
In  our  case,  this  additional  external  excitation  would  couple  into  the  ferromagnetic
structure, decreasing both the bias field and the curvature of the field.

Dynamic properties. The use of big coils (lots of loops) results in a big

long to allow a good transfer of atoms into the magnetic trap. By assisting
the  switching  with  a  capacitor,  we  are  able  to  reduce  t   to  less  than  a
millisecond.

Eddy  currents  are  expected  to  seriously  slow  down  the  switching,  and
indeed  a  field  decay  constant  of  more  than  10  ms  was  found  in  our  first
electromagnet8. The use of laminated material (stacked 100  mm/1  mm  thick
layers of ferromagnetic materials isolated by epoxy) solves this problem and
allows to switch ON or OFF the field within 100 ms.

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The experimental setup is shown on Fig. 5. The electromagnet is placed
around  a  glass  cell  of  inner  section  of  1  ·
  2  cm2,  pumped  with  two  ion
pumps and a titanium sublimation pump. The background pressure is of the
order of 10-11 mbar. The tip to tip spacing is 3 cm for the poles of the dipole,
and 2 cm for the poles of both quadrupoles. The power consumption is 25 W
per  coil  for  a  gradient  of  900  Gauss/cm,  and  the  maximum  gradient  at
saturation is 1400 Gauss/cm.

INTERRUPTED EVAPORATIVE COOLING IN A
HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD

To  achieve  Bose-Einstein  Condensation  (BEC),  we  use  RF-induced

evaporative cooling of the 87Rb atoms confined in the magnetic trap.

In  the  approximation  of  the  magnetic  moment  of  the  atom  adiabatically
following the direction of the field during the atomic motion, the magnetic
potential is a function of the modulus of the field and the projection  hm  of
the total angular momentum on the field axis. Depending on the sign of  m,
the  Zeeman  sublevel  will  be  confined  towards  (trapping  state)  or  expelled
from (non-trapping state) a local minimum of the field modulus. RF-induced
evaporative cooling consists of coupling the trapping state to a non-trapping
state  with  a  radio-frequency  field  (RF  knife),  in  order  to  remove  the  most
energetic atoms from the trap.

Efficient  evaporative  cooling14-16  relies  on  fast  thermal  relaxation,  and
thus on the ability of increasing the collision rate by adiabatic compression
of the atomic cloud. The most widely used mean to increase the curvature of
the  trapping  potential  is  to  partially  cancel  the  bias  field  B0  with  two
additional  coils  in  Helmholtz  configuration  along  the  z-axis.  As  seen  in
Eq.(4),  this  increases  the  radial  curvature  without  changing  the  axial
curvature.  Typical  values  of  the  compensated  bias  field  in  previous
experiments are 1 to 10 Gauss. One can also radially compress the atomic
cloud by increasing the gradient  G without modifying the bias field. This is
the  approach  for  our  trap.  However,  the  quadratic  Zeeman  effect  is  not
negligible anymore.

the hyperfine structure. It gives a quadratic Zeeman effect of about 2 MHz at
100 Gauss (a typical bias field for our trap). An immediate consequence is
that the (F = 2, mF = 0) state is a trapping state. For a small magnetic field, as
in  most  experiments,  the  second  order  in  Eq.(6)  is  negligible.  The  RF
coupling  between  adjacent  Zeeman  sublevels  (  |D m|  =  1)  results  in  an
adiabatic multiphoton transition to a non-trapping state, leading to efficient
RF  induced  evaporative  cooling.  In  the  case  of  a  high  bias  field,  the  RF
couplings  are  not  resonant  at  the  same  location  because  of  the  quadratic
Zeeman  effect.  Depending  on  the  hyperfine  level,  this  effect  leads  to
different scenarios17,  that  we  have  experimentally  identified18  thanks  to  our
magnetic trap allowing strong confinement with a high bias field.

Figure 6. Forced evaporative cooling, in the presence of the quadratic Zeeman shift. We have
plotted the magnetic energy of the (F = 2, mF = 0) sublevels as a function of a trap coordinate
r (the magnetic field B(r) = B0+b r2). For a given RF frequency, the various transitions do not
happen at the same position. We have indicated with black arrows the resonant transitions and
with white arrows what would happen in the absence of quadratic corrections.

For atoms in the (F = 2, mF = 2) state, forced evaporative cooling will be
subject to unwanted effects as the RF knife gets close to the bottom of the
potential well. Indeed, we can only cool down the sample to about 50  mK
until  the  atoms  cannot  be  transferred  to  a  non-trapping  state  and  cooling
stops.  In  addition,  a  careful  analysis  of  the  evaporation  shows  that  it  can
only be optimized to rather poor efficiency. In order to give an insight of the
efficiency  of  the  forced  evaporation  in  such  a  situation,  let  us  consider  an
atom  initially  in  the  mF  =  2  trapping  state,  and  following  the  path
represented in Fig. 7 to connect to the mF = -1 non-trapping state.

Figure 7.  One short paths connecting the trapping state  (F =  2, mF = 2) to the non-trapping
state (F = 2, mF = - 1). The atom crosses 5 times the RF knife without making a transition at
point B and E.

The atom, travelling from the center of the trap, reaches the RF knife at
A,  and  makes  a  transition  to  the  mF  =  +1  state  at  B  with  a  transition
probability P. From there, it continues to move away from the center. When
it comes back towards the center of the trap, the atom passing on  B  must
not make a transition in order to reach the RF knife on  C. The probability
to reach BC from OA is P(1 - P). Assuming the same probability  P for all
the RF transitions, the probability that the atoms follows the path shown in
Fig. 7 and leaves the trap on  EU is P3(1 - P)2. There are 4 analogous paths
involving  5  crossings  of 
the  RF  knife.  Consequently,  neglecting
interference  effects,  the  total  probability  associated  to  these  4  short
evaporation paths is 4P3 (1 - P)2. This probability has a maximum value of
53 ,  and  is  associated  to  a
about 10% for a transition probability  P of 
precise  value  of  the  atomic  velocity.  When  considering  all  possible
velocities, the probability of leaving the trap on  mF =  -1  averages  to  less
than  10%,  much  less  than  for  the  standard  situation  where  the  adiabatic
passage has 100% efficiency for almost all velocities17,19. The experimental
observation on Fig. 8 supports this simple analysis: when we increase the
RF power, the efficiency of the evaporation reaches a maximum and then
decreaseiii.

In  addition,  all  paths  longer  than  the  5  crossings  path  as  in  Fig.  7
contribute to build up a macroscopic population in the intermediate levels mF
= 1 and mF = 0, as soon as evaporation starts. This results in the presence of
the atoms intermediate sublevels during the evaporation and the observation
of a heating of 5 mK/s of the mF = 2 cloud, when we remove the RF knife at
the end of the evaporation19.

iii Of course, with sufficient RF power (P > 100 W), we would eventually reach a situation
where all the various transitions merge, and a direct adiabatic transition to a non-trapping
state with 100% efficiency would be obtained.

optical thickness of the atomic cloud. A clear optimum can be observed in the F = 2 case (the

relative height between F = 1 and F = 2 is arbitrary).

Forced evaporative cooling for atoms trapped in (F = 1,  mF =  - 1)  is  not
adversely affected by the quadratic Zeeman effect  at  a  bias  field  B0  of  207
Gauss, since the  mF  =  0  state  is  non-trapping  because  of  the  sign  of  the
quadratic term. The RF power has to be large enough to ensure an adiabatic
transfer to mF = 0 with an efficiency close to 1. For atoms in the F = 1 state,
after adiabatic compression, the oscillation frequencies are  W
  =  18  Hz
along the dipole axis, and  W
  =  55  Hz  along  both  quadrupole  axis.  We
could successfully cool down the sample, and we obtained a condensate of a
few 106 atoms as shown Fig. 9.

REACHING BEC IN F=2 IN HIGH  MAGNETIC
FIELD

Several  strategies  can  circumvent  the  adverse  consequences  of  the
quadratic Zeeman effect, and achieve efficient forced evaporative cooling of
87Rb in F = 2.

5.1 

Evaporation with 3 RF knives22

When evaporating the (F = 2,  mF = 2) state of  87Rb  in  a  high  bias  field
trap like ours, the RF couplings between the adjacent magnetic sublevels are
not  resonant  at  the  location  in  the  trap.  Thus  the  transfer  of  atoms  from
trapping  to  non-trapping  states  is  inefficient  (or  even  non-existent).  This
problem can be overcome if we evaporate with three distinct RF frequencies
chosen so that a direct transition to a non trapping state is always possible, as
shown in Fig. 10.

Figure 10. Implementation of 3 RF knives to evaporate in a high magnetic field. All possible
transitions are represented. Frequency matching is only achieved at the RF knife K.

However the requirement of three independent frequency sources is not
very  practicaliv.  Rather  a  simpler  solution  involving  the  mixing  of  two
frequencies  will  compensate  the  quadratic  term  of  the  Zeeman  shift.  As
calculated on Eq.(6), the difference between successive RF transition is the
same.  Thus,  compensation  is  achievable  by  mixing  one  independent
frequency  source  (the  carrier)  with  another  RF  frequency  source  of
frequency  dv  to  obtain  a  pair  of  sidebands  of  fixed  detuning  and

iv Apart from the technological complexity, the mixing of 3 different frequencies can generate

sidebands that will induce stray RF knives, reducing the evaporation efficiency.

approximately the same power as the carrierv. This detuning by is chosen as
to align the three knives perfectly at the end of the evaporation ramp.

This approach will be limited to magnetic fields where the higher order
Zeeman terms are not significantvi. Indeed, one has to compare the quadratic
correction in Eq.(6) with the well-known Breit-Rabi formula:

are  shown  in  table  1.  We  list  only  the  transitions  required  to  transfer  the
atoms to the first non-trapping state (F = 2, mF = - 1).

From table 1 we can immediately see that for a bias field of 207 Gauss
this approach will not work : it is impossible to choose a sideband detuning
dv for which either the (F = 2, mF = 2) ﬁ
 (F = 2, mF = 1) or the (F = 2,  mF =
0) ﬁ
 (F = 2,  mF = - 1) transition will not be detuned from resonance by at
least 500 kHz. This is much larger than the available RF power broadening
estimated  to  be  of  about  10  kHz.  Indeed,  experimentally  when  evaporating
(F = 2, mF = 2) with the 3 RF knifes in this bias field we are unable to cool
the atoms below 15  mK. However this is an order of magnitude lower than
the lowest temperature we can obtain when evaporating (F = 2,  mF = 2) with
only one RF knife (100  mK).  In  a  bias  field  of  111  Gauss  the  situation  is
already  better  with  a  optimum  detuning  of  the  two  sidebands  from  their

v Additional sidebands of much lower power are also generated. Consequently, this forced us

to reduce the RF power of the 3 knives to avoid unwanted evaporation effects.

vi Of course, even then the evaporation efficiency at the start of the ramp will not be optimal
as the frequency detuning of sidebands has been optimised for magnetic field at the end of
the ramp.

respective resonance of 50 kHz. Here we can cool the (F = 2,  mF = 2) cloud
down to 500 nK, and obtain a phase space density of 0.1. We believe that
with  just  a  little  more  RF  power  or  better  initial  conditions  for  the
evaporation the condensation of (F = 2, mF = 2) should be possible with this
technique for this bias field. When we again lower the bias field by a factor
of  two  to  56  Gauss  the  effect  of  the  nonlinear  terms  of  the  Zeeman  shift
higher than the quadratic correction becomes negligible compared to the RF
power  broadening.  Here  we  were  able  to  cool  atoms  below  100  nK  and
could attain BEC in (F = 2,  mF = 2)  as  desired.  It  should  be  noted  that  the
effect  of  the  quadratic  correction  to  the  Zeeman  shift  is  significant  here,
since with one RF knife we are unable to cool the cloud below 10 mK. Figure
11 shows a graph of the measured number of atoms in a condensate of (F =
2, mF = 2) as a function of the sideband detuning dv. The optimal detuning of
the  RF  sidebands  from  the  central  carrier  is  measured  to  be  0.45  MHz  in
good agreement with the prediction of table 1. The width of the curve in Fig.
11  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  estimated  Rabi  frequency  and  with  the
residuals calculated with Eq.(8). From this, we can conclude that the average
Rabi frequency of our RF knives is indeed of the order of 10 kHz.

in  a  high  magnetic  field  is  to  use  sympathetic  cooling20.  In  sympathetic
cooling,  one  evaporatively  cools  one  species  of  atom,  a  second  species
being  cooled  simply  by  thermal  contact  with  the  former.  In  our  case,  we
evaporate (F = 1, mF = - 1) which we know may be efficiently cooled by the
standard method, even in a high magnetic field, and use them to cool atoms
in (F = 2,  mF  =  2).  This  cooling  method  is  nearly  lossless  for  the  (F  =  2,

14

mF = 2) atoms as they are evaporated in a potential twice as strong as the
(F = 1, mF = - 1) atoms.

The  efficiency  of  sympathetic  cooling  can  be  estimated  with  a  simple
model assuming that the two species are always at thermal equilibrium. The
total energy of the system can be written

since the number N2 of atoms in (F = 2,  mF  =  2)  is  nearly  constant  during
evaporation. If we assume that evaporation is performed at fixed height  h,
one can simply integrate Eq.(12) by replacing  E and  dE  by  their  expression
in Eqs. (10) and (11). This results in the equation

For example, if we choose h to be 5 (a typical value for experiments) and
one  can  immediately  see  that  the  minimum

achievable temperature Tmin scales as the initial ratio

estimate if the initial conditions are sufficient to achieve BEC. For that, we
need to compare Tmin to the critical temperature

be chosen to either condense (F = 1, mF = - 1) before (F = 2, mF = 2), or (F =
2, mF  =  2)  before  (F = 1,  mF =  - 1). If  N2  is  too  large,  no  condensation  is
possible and if  N2  is  too  small,  only  the  (F  =  1,  mF =  - 1)  atoms  can  be
condensed. This happens for a critical number of atoms

In order to keep evaporative cooling efficient all the way towards BEC,
one has to insure that the atoms remain in good thermal contact. Because of
gravity the (F = 1,  mF =  - 1)  cloud  is  centered  below  the  (F = 2,  mF  =  2)
cloud  as  it  is  more  weakly  trapped.  This  displacement  between  the  two
clouds is given by

(16)

For a fixed gradient G = 900 Gauss/cm this gives a variation with  B0, D
=0.16  mm/Gauss.  The  RMS  width  of  a  thermal  cloud  decreases  with  the
square root of the cloud temperature during the cooling, so assuming the two
clouds  must  be  within  one  RMS  width  of  each  other  for  good  thermal
contact we can obtain an estimate for the minimum temperature to which (F
= 2,  mF = 2) can  be  sympathetically  cooled  by  atoms  in  (F = 1,  mF =  - 1),
namely,

proportional to the bias field B0. For a gradient G = 900 Gauss/cm (Eq. (17))
may be evaluated to give a variation with  B0 of  Tlimit  @
  1.4  nK/Gauss.  The
physical interpretation of this is simple; for our trap, the higher the value of
the bias field, the weaker the confinement of the quadrupole, the larger the
displacement  between  the  two  species  and  hence  the  higher  the  minimum
possible  temperature.  Experimentally  this  simple  theory  was  in  good
agreement  with  our  observations.  By  a  careful  adjustment  in  the  optical
pumping  cycle  during  the  transfer  to  the  magnetic  trap  we  could  start  the
evaporation with a small but controllable fraction of the atoms in the (F = 2,
mF = 2) state and the rest in the (F = 1, mF = - 1) state. For a bias field of 207

RF-induced evaporative cooling and BEC in a high magnetic field

Gauss we found we were able to cool the atoms in (F = 2,  mF = 2) down to a
temperature  of  400  nK,  in  rough  agreement  with  the  simple  estimate  of
Eq. (17) of 290 nK. The phase space density for the (F = 2,  mF = 2) cloud at
this  point  was  0.05.  Further  cooling  the  (F  =  1,  mF =  - 1)  cloud  did  not
reduce the temperature of the atoms in (F = 2, mF = 2).

When we repeated this experiment for a bias field of 56 Gauss, we were
able to condense (F = 2,  mF = 2) sympathetically in the presence of (F = 2,
mF = - 1) for a sufficiently small initial number of atoms in (F = 2,  mF = 2).
When the proportion of atoms in the (F = 2,  mF = 2) state is too large their
rethermalization heats the cooling atoms in (F = 1, mF = - 1) too much for an
efficient  evaporation.  Fig.  12  shows  phase  space  density  in  each  state  as  a
function  of  the  final  frequency  of  the  evaporation  ramp,  for  three  different
initial numbers of atoms in the (F = 2, mF = 2) state.

function of the RF frequency. a) The number of atoms in (F = 2,  mF = 2) is small enough so
as not to significantly affect the evaporation of the atoms in (F = 1,  mF =  - 1):  in  the  total
absence of atoms in (F = 2, mF = 2) we could produce condensate in (F = 1,  mF = - 1) with a
similar transition temperature and number of atoms. In this case the cloud of atoms in (F = 1,
mF = - 1) attains sufficient phase space density nl3 to condense before the atoms in (F = 2,  mF
= 2). b) The number of atoms in (F = 2, mF = 2) is two times higher and the evaporation of the
(F = 1, mF = - 1) cloud is significantly hampered by the sympathetic cooling of (F = 2,  mF =
2) atoms. Here the atoms in (F = 2, mF = 2) attain sufficient phase space density to condense
before the (F = 1,  mF =  - 1),  as  even  though  there  are  less  of  them  they  are  more  tightly
confined in the magnetic trap. c) The number of atoms in (F = 2,  mF = 2) is too large too be
cooled sympathetically to the temperature required for condensation d) Diagram showing the
2 clouds remain in good thermal equilibrium during all the evaporation.

AN APPLICATION OF HIGH BIAS FIELD:
COUPLING BETWEEN 2 POTENTIAL WELLS

The quadratic Zeeman effect can be an asset rather than a nuisance once
condensation is reached. For instance, one can make a selective transfer of
part of the condensate from the (F = 1,  mF =  - 1) state to the (F = 2,  mF = 0)
state by using a 6.8 GHz pulse. Thanks to the quadratic Zeeman effect,  the
(F = 2,  mF = 0) state is a very shallow trapping state (for a bias field of 56
Gauss, the oscillation frequencies are 
 along the quadrupole and
  along  the  dipole),  some  features  of  a  trapped  Bose  gas  can
eventually be observed more easily. We studied the weak coupling between
those two states by turning on a weak 6.8 GHz RF knife.

ourselves  to  the  vertical  dimension,  where  the  two  traps  are  offset.  In  the

This state has a size of typically  sx @

 10mm. The origin of coordinates is
taken at the center of this trap. We will neglect the interactions in the (F = 2,
mF  =  0)  potential  well.  Consequently,  the  weak  RF  knives  will  couple  the
wave function  j (x)  to  the  eigenstates  Y
n(x  -  D)  of  the  F  =  2  trapping

IMPROVED IRON CORE ELECTROMAGNET
TRAPS

A new design of the pole pieces allow for a compensated bias field  B0  -
on  the  order  of  1  Gauss  -  while  keeping  a  significant  value  for  the  dipole
curvature  C  -  on  the  order  of  100  Gauss/cm2.  This,  combined  with  an
improved  quadrupole  gradient  to  2400  Gauss/cm  allows  for  a  very  high
compression  ratio.  Depending  on  the  initial  number  of  atoms,  this  would
allow to reach BEC in a few seconds.

The  parameters  of  this  new  trap  will  also  allow  for  studying  new
properties  of  BEC.  Given  a  bias  field  of  80mG,  this  trap  has  a  transverse
field  curvature  of  7· 107G/cm2,  such  that  the  ratio  of  the  transverse  to
longitudinal field curvatures is 106: 1. This large asymmetry in the trapping
potential  will  allow  to  form  a  1D  system.  When  the  temperature  of  the
system  is  low  enough,  particles  are  frozen  into  the  quantum  mechanical
ground state of the transverse dimensions. However, since the ground state
energy in the longitudinal direction is roughly 103 times smaller than that of
the transverse direction (since ground state energy scales as the square root
of  the  field  curvature),  excited  longitudinal  states  can  still  be  occupied.  In
this  one-dimensional  regime,  the  physics  of  collisions,  thermalization,  and
quantum degeneracy follow laws which are qualitatively different from those
of the typical three-dimensional system.

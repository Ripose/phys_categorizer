 DOES THE FORMATION OF TEMPERATURE DEPENDENCE OF 
AXION WALLS HELP DELINEATE A REGIME WHERE THE 
WHEELER DE WITT EQUATION HOLDS?

 

 

A. W. Beckwith 

ABSTRACT  

We  present  a  model  with  a  phase  transition  bridge  from  a  tilted  washboard 

potential to the chaotic inflationary model pioneered by Guth which is congruent with the 

slow  roll  criteria.  This  permits  physically  intuitive  criteria  for  the  creation  of  cold  dark 

matter, indirectly observed in present day cosmology, and depends upon axion walls as 

the  main  part  of  the  scalar  potential  system  having  a  temperature  dependence.  We  are 

asking  if  the  quantum  geometry  of  early  universe  transitions  from  quantum  bounce 

conditions  to  the  classically  observed  general  relativity  regime  where  the  traditional 

Weinberg  De  Witt  equation  is  applicable,  as  outlined  by  Abhay  Ashtekar,  et  al.  in  a 

recent  article  in  Physical.  Review.  Letters.in  any  way  depend  upon  contributions  from 

axion walls in early universe conditions?

We  should  keep  in  mind  that 

Cφ   in  Eqn  2a  is  an  equilibrium  value  of  a  true 

vacuum minimum of Eqn. 2a after tunneling. In the potential system given as Eqn, (2a) 

we see a steadily rising scalar field value which is consistent with the physics of Figure 1 

. In the potential system given by Eqn. (2b) we see a reduction of the ‘height of a scalar 

field which is consistent with the chaotic inflationary potential overshoot phenomena We 

should  note  that 

∗φ

  in  Eq (2a  )is  a  measure  of  the  onset  of  quantum  fluctuations. 

Appendix I is a discussion of Axion potentials which we claim is part of the contribution 

of the potential given in Eqn. (2a) Note that the tilt to the potential given in Eqn. (2a) is 

due to a quantum fluctuation. As explained by Guth for quadratic potentials2,

  is  the  enormous  value  of  the  cosmological  constant 

which  is

  larger  than  what  it  is  observed  to  be  today.  However,  if  axions  are 

involved in the formation of instaton physics for early universe nucleation, then Eqn. (4) 

 

- 4 - 

 

tells us that as can be expected for very high initial temperatures that axions are without 

mass  but  exist  as  an  energy  construct.  Does  this  process  if  it  occurs  lend  then  to  the 

regime  where  there  is  a  bridge  between  classical  applications  of  the  Wheeler  De  Witt 

equation to the quantum bounce condition raised by Ashtekar 6 ?  

TIE IN WITH DI QUARK POTENTIAL SYSTEMS, AND THE 
CLASSICAL WHEELER DE-WITT EQUATION. 

We  previously  found  problems  with  previous  calculations  of  the  cosmological 

constant  as  seen  in  the  current  QCD  calculations8  which  we  believe  are  solved  by  the 

inclusion of temperature dependent behavior of the axion wall mass. In doing so, though, 

we  now  need  to  raise  the  question  of  a  transition  from  a  regime  where  the  classical 

Wheeler De Witt equation holds, as in n=2 versions of scalar potential as shown by Eqn . 

(2b)  above  to  where  it  breaks  down,  as  shown  by  Abbay  Ashtekar’s  quantum  bounce 

discretized  version  of  the  same  Wheeler  De  Witt  equation.  Let  us  first  review  classical 

De  Witt  theory  which  incidently  ties  in  with  inflationary  n=  2  scalar  potential  field 

cosmology.

main point made above, is that a potential operator based upon a quadratic term leads to a 

Gaussian  wavefunctional  with  an  exponential  similarly  dependent  upon  a  quadratic 

2φ

exponent. We do approximate solitons via the evolution of Eqn. (9) above, and so how 

we  reconcile  higher  order  potential  terms  in  this  approximation  of  wave  functionals  is 

extremely important. 

Now  Ashtekar  in  his  longer  arXIV  article11  make  reference  to  a  revision  of  this

Also,  and  more  importantly  this  Θ   is  a  difference  operator,  allowing  for  a 

treatment of the scalar field as an ‘emergent time’ , or ‘internal time’ so that one can set 

up a wave functional built about a Gaussian wavefunctional defined via

Henrique’s, which has a Gaussian wave functional. as given by Eqn. (9) In terms of phase

in tandem with a cancellation of di quark contributions to Eqn. (2a) in which  Fφ is for the

Tφ is for finding the

CONCLUSION.  

We  are  presenting  a  question  which  may  be  of  relevance  to  JDEM  research. 

Namely  if  Ashtekar  is  correct  in  his  quantum  geometry6,  and  the  break  down  of  early 

universe  conditions  not  permitting  the  typical  application  of  the  Wheeler  De  Witt 

equation, then what do we have to verify it experimentally? The axion wall dependence 

so indicated above may provide an answer to that, and may be experimentally measurable 

via Kadotas pixel reconstructive scheme.12

Furthermore, we also argue that the semi classical analysis of the initial potential 

system as given by Eqn (2) above and its subsequent collapse is de facto evidence for a 

phase transition to conditions allowing for cold dark energy to be created at the beginning 

of  inflationary  cosmology..13,14.This  builds  upon  an  earlier  paper  done  by  Kolb  in 

minimum  conditions  for  reconstructing  scalar  potentials15,16,17,18.It  also  will  necessitate 

reviewing  other  recent  derivation  bound  to  the  cosmological  constant  in  cosmology 

model in a more sophisticated manner than has been presently done19,20. In doing so, it 

may be appropriate to try to reconcile A. Ashtekar’s approach involving a discretization 

- 10 - 

 

of  the  Wheeler  De  Witt  equation  with  the  bounce  calculations  in  general  cosmology 

pioneered by Hackworth and Weinberg21.. 

APPENDIX I. 

FORMING AN AXION POTENTIAL TERM AS PART OF THE 
CONTRIBUTION TO EQUATION 2A

Here,  he  has  the  mass  of  the  Axion  potential  as  given  by

  as  well  as  a 

discussion of symmetry breaking which occurs with a temperature

T ≈

PQf

. Furthermore, 

he  states  that  the  Axion  goes  to  a  massless  regime  for  high  temperatures,  and  becomes 

massive as the temperature drops. Due to the fact that Axions were cited by Zhitinisky in 

his QCD ball formation22, this is worth considering, and I claim that this potential is part 

of  Eqn.  (6a)  with  the  added  term  giving  a  tilt  to  this  potential  system,  due  to  the  role 

quantum  fluctuations  play  in  inflation.  Here,  N>1  leads  to  tipping  of  the  wine  bottle 

potential, and N degenerate CP-conserving minimal values. The interested reader is urged 

to consult section 10.3 of Kolb’s Early universe book for additional details7.

Abstract: 
Previously  unobserved  nitrous  oxide  transitions  around  2.5  µm  are  measured  by  intracavity 
laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS) analyzed by time-resolved Fourier transform (TRFT) 
spectrometer. With an accuracy of the order of 10-3 cm-1, measured positions of 1637 assigned 
weak transitions are provided. They belong to 42 vibrational transitions, among which 33 are 
observed  for  the  first  time.  These  data  are  believed  to  be  useful  in  particular  to  monitoring 
atmosphere purposes.

In this note, intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy (ICLAS) coupled (1) with time-
resolved Fourier transform (TRFT) spectrometer is applied  to the measurement of previously 
unobserved  N2O  transitions  around  2.5  µm.  High  resolution  absorption  spectra  of  N2O  in 
natural  isotopic  abundance  are  recorded  around  4000  cm-1  with  kilometric  absorption  path 
lengths.  Their  analysis  reveals  the  observed  weak  transitions  belong  to  42  vibrational 
transitions,  among  which  33  are  observed  for  the  first  time.  These  data  are  believed  to  be 
useful in particular for atmospheric applications. 

The  laser,  installed  in  a  vacuum  chamber,  is  made  of  Cr2+:  ZnSe  amplifying  medium 
inserted in X-fold cavity. It is optically pumped with an Er3+ fiber doped laser emitting at 1.6 
µm.  The  pumping  beam  is  chopped  by  an  acousto-optic  modulator.  The  laser  build-up  is 
recorded with a TRFTS equipped with two InSb detectors cooled at 77 K. More details on the 
experimental  setup  may  be  found  in  the  instrumentally  oriented  paper  (2)  and  in  (3)  where 
new data measurements and analysis for 23 C2H2 molecular bands located around 4000 cm-1 
are also reported.  

Three N2O time-resolved spectra (numbered 508, 509, 510) have been recorded (4) with 
natural  sample  pressures  respectively  equal  to  3.49,  70.62,  70.58  hPa  (2.62,  53.0,  and  52.9 
Torr). The gas was inserted in the vacuum chamber. This provides, with the elimination of the 
parasitic atmospheric absorption, the advantage of a laser cavity filling ratio practically equal 
to unity. All TRFT spectra of the laser emission were recorded with 64 time samples, 1.6 µs 
time  resolution  and  32  co-additions.  Unapodized  spectral  resolutions  and  recording  times 
were respectively 0.037, 0.037, 0.007 cm-1 and 5, 5, and 25 minutes.  

Figure 1 displays the general temporal behavior of the spectrum nb. 510 with restricted 
spectral  resolution.  The  laser  line  is  narrowing  with  increasing  generation  times  reaching  at 
most  120  µs.  With  7.1  km  absorption  path  length  the  spectrum  covers  150  cm-1, 
approximately  from  3900  to  4050  cm-1.  With  33.5  km  absorption  path  length  the  spectral 
coverage is restricted to 60 cm-1, from 3955 to 4005 cm-1. As in Ref.(3), it has been checked 
that no deviation to the linear evolution versus the generation time of the peak absorbance is 
observed. No attempt was made to tune the Cr2+: ZnSe laser.  

Wavenumber scale of the spectra have been calibrated against lines from residual water 
vapor  in  the  laser  chamber,  using  (5).  Line  positions  reported  here  were  measured  in  the  3 
temporal samples of spectrum 510. Their sequence number is 6, 16, 26 corresponding to the 
equivalent  absorption  paths  7,  12,  17  km.  Their  respective  wavenumber  scales  were  first 
checked to be consistent within an average of 4 10-4 cm-1. Full width at half maximum of the 
N2O profiles in spectrum 510 (pressure: 70.58 hPa) is of the order of 20 10-3 cm-1, revealing 
as  expected  contribution  of  collisional  broadening.  The  accuracy  of  the  line  position 
measurements  is  of  the  order  of  10-3  cm-1.  Only  well-resolved  and  unsaturated  lines  were 
taken  into  account.  Line  sequences  detected  with  a  Loomis-Wood  program  (6),  were  left 
unprocessed  and  are  not  reported  in  this  note,  when  at  least  15  lines  were  not  fitting  the 
selection criteria. Altogether, 42 bands are observed. Among them, 32 belong to 14N2
16O, 4 to 
14N15N16O, 4 to 15N14N16O, and 2 to 14N2
16O bands consist of 1 Σ-Σ, 11 Σ-Π, 2 
18O. The 14N2
Σ-Φ,  2  Π−Φ,  4  Π−Π,  8  Π−∆  and  4  ∆−Φ  transitions.  All  the  14N15N16O,  15N14N16O,  and 
18O bands are Σ-Π  transitions. Practically all the observed lines are transitions between 
14N2
already  known  energy  levels.  Only  the  13312  14N2
16O  energy  level  is  observed  for  the  first 
time. In order to appreciate the validity of our measurements, least-squares fits of individual 
bands were performed using the polynomial expression : 

E(v,J) = G +BX –DX² +HX3+ LX4 with X = J(J+1) 

The lower state constants were held fixed in the fits to the excellent values given in (7) 

and (8). Only the lines measured in our spectra were processed in the fits.   

The  42  observed  bands  are  summarized  with  their  assignments  and  calculated  band 
centers in Table 1. A full resolution small part of the temporal sample n° 6 already shown in 
Figure 1 is given on Figure 2 with spectral assignments of the resolved lines. In the Journal

supplementary material, 3 additional tables are given. Table 2 reports for 14N2
16O the effective 
parameters obtained from our calculations and their corresponding values taken in (7) and (8). 
Table  3  reports  similar  results  for  the  isotopologues  14N15N16O,  15N14N16O,  and  14N2
18O. 
Table 4 is aimed to be a convenient tool. It provides in increasing order 1637 measured line 
positions, with their corresponding “observed – calculated” values and their isotopologue and 
rovibrational assignments.

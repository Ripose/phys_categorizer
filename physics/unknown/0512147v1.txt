ABSTRACT 

The probability tomography approach developed for the scalar resistivity method is here extended to the 2D 
tensorial apparent resistivity acquisition mode. The rotational invariant derived from the trace of the apparent 
resistivity tensor is considered, since it gives on the datum plane anomalies confined above the buried objects. 
Firstly, a departure function is introduced as the difference between the tensorial invariant measured over the 
real structure and that computed for a reference uniform structure. Secondly, a resistivity anomaly occurrence 
probability (RAOP) function is defined as a normalised crosscorrelation involving the experimental departure 
function and a scanning function derived analytically using the Frechet derivative of the electric potential for 
the  reference  uniform  structure. The  RAOP  function  can  be  calculated  in  each  cell  of  a  3D  grid  filling  the 
investigated volume, and the resulting values can then be contoured in order to obtain the 3D tomographic 
image. Each non-vanishing value of the RAOP function is interpreted as the probability which a resistivity 
departure  from  the  reference  resistivity  obtain  in  a  cell  as  responsible  of  the  observed  tensorial  apparent 
resistivity dataset on the datum plane. A synthetic case shows that the highest RAOP values correctly indicate 
the position of the buried objects and a very high spacial resolution can be obtained even for adjacent objects 
with opposite resistivity contrasts with respect to the resistivity of the hosting matrix. Finally, an experimental 
field case dedicated to an archaeological application of the resistivity tensor method is presented as a proof of 
the high resolution power of the probability tomography imaging, even when the data are collected in noisy 
open field conditions. 

 
 
 
 

INTRODUCTION 

 
High-resolution  geoelectrical  data  acquisition  tools  are 
now routinely applied to solve many practical problems 
in environmental and civil engineering, cultural heritage 
and non-destructive testing. In order to elicit the highest 
amount of information from large datasets, more target-
oriented 3D imaging techniques are demanded. It should 
be stressed that, in near-surface geophysics, the relevant 
information is generally limited to the identification and 
spatial collocation of the buried physical sources of the 
anomalies detected on the soil, since nature and quality 
of the materials to be identified are normally known in 
advance. 

Among  the  various  approaches  to  geophysical  data 
imaging,  probability  tomography  is  gaining  increasing 
attention as to objectivity and reliability. The principles 
of the 3D probability tomography in applied geophysics 
were  established  for  the  self-potential  method  (Patella, 
1997 a,b), then exported to the geoelectric method based 
on  the  conventional  scalar  apparent  resistivity  concept 
(Mauriello et al., 1998; Mauriello and Patella, 1999), to 
the  electromagnetic  induction  methods  (Mauriello  and 
Patella,  1999,  2000),  and  to  the  gravity  (Mauriello  and 

Patella, 2001 a,b) and magnetic methods (Mauriello and 
Patella,  2005).  The  resolution  power  of  the  probability 
tomography imaging, using either one or a combination 
of  geophysical  investigation  methods  has  been  largely 
documented in recent years in earth science (Di Maio et 
al., 1998; Iuliano et al., 2001, 2002 a,b; Lapenna et al., 
2000; Mauriello et al., 2004) and in archaeological and 
cultural  heritage  (Cammarano  et  al.,  2000  a,b;  Patella 
and Mauriello, 1999) applications. 

The purpose of this paper is to further extend the 3D 
probability tomography imaging approach to the geoel-
ectrical method based on the less commonly utilised but 
still  very  promising  apparent  resistivity  tensor  concept 
(Bibby, 1977). 
 
 

APPARENT RESISTIVITY TENSOR ANALYSIS 

 
The concept of apparent resistivity tensor 
 
Consider a generic 3D resistivity structure buried below 
a flat free surface. Assume that a resistivity survey has 
been performed inside a rectangular area S using distinct 
bipole current sources. Following Bibby (1977), for the 
generic i-th bipole source the law

can be introduced to relate the measured electrical field 
vector  Ei  to  the  current  density  vector  Ji  for  a  uniform 
half-space,  using  the  concept  of  apparent  resistivity 
tensor ρ(a).

Using  two  bipoles  (i=1,2),  ρ(a)  is  given  as  (Bibby

Using this form one can define rotational invariants, 
which are independent of the direction of the electrical 
field and the individual current source bipoles. We con-
sider  the  invariant  P related to  the  trace of ρ(a)  (Bibby, 
1986),  which  has  the  important  property  of  providing 
anomalies closely confined about the sources. P is given

P(rq)=

Each value of η(rq) is interpreted as the probability 
that a resistivity anomaly can obtain in the q-th cell, as 
responsible of the shape pattern of the ∆P-function over 
S.  Positive η(rq)  values  are  associated  with  increments 
of resistivity with respect to mod0, while negative values 
are associated with decrements of resistivity. 

The role of probability given to η(rq) is motivated as 
follows.  As  is  well  known,  a  probability  measure  P  is 
defined  as  a  function  assigning  to  every  subset  γ  of  a 
space of states Γ a real number P(γ) such that (Gneden-
ko, 1979) 
 
P(γ)≥0, for every γ, 
P(Γ)=1, 

  (17a) 
  (17b) 

if γ=α∪β, with α∩β≡0, 
P(γ)=P(α∪β)=P(α)+P(β). 
 

Assuming that the presence of a resistivity departure 
at rq does not depend on the presence of a resistivity de-
parture at another point, the function

where V is a generic volume including all non-vanishing 
values of |η(rq)|, can be defined as a probability density, 
allowing a measure of the probability to get a resistivity 
departure at rq to be obtained in agreement with axioms 
(17a,b,c). 

Actually,  the  definition  given  in  eq.14  differs  from 
that in eq.18 for an unknown constant factor appearing 
at  the  denominator  of  eq.18,  and  has  the  advantage  of 
giving information on the sign of the sources. Therefore, 
η(rq) can conventionally be assumed as a measure of the 
resistivity anomaly occurrence probability.

The resistivity anomaly probability tomography 
 
The  3D  RAPT  imaging  approach  consists  in  a  cross-
correlation procedure performed by the scanner function 
ℑ(r−rq)  over  the  data  function  ∆P(r)  within  a  volume, 
called the tomospace, lying below the survey area S. In 
practice,  we  utilise  an  elementary  cell  with  a  positive 
resistivity anomaly of unitary strength to scan the whole 
tomospace  and  search  where  resistivity  variations  with 
respect to a reference mod0 are placed in a probabilistic 
sense. For each position of the scanning element, i.e. for 
each  value  of  q,  the  corresponding  value  of  η(rq)  is 
calculated using a discretized version of eq.14 given as

Each value of ηq is attributed to the central point of 
the scanning elementary cell. The final step is a regular 
grid of values of ηq, which can be contoured in order to 
obtain a tomography imaging of the scanned volume. 
 
 

A SYNTHETIC EXAMPLE 

 
To  test  the  resolving  power  of  the  RAPT  method,  we 
consider the synthetic example of a composite prismatic 
target immersed in a uniform half-space. Fig.1 shows a 
plan and section view of a two-block structure, where a 
resistive  prism  is  coupled  with  a  conductive  composite 
prism. This synthetic example has been chosen in order 
to  analyze  the response of  the  method  on a  model  best 
approximating the geometry of a known archaeological 
structure which will be discussed later as field example. 
In fig.1, A1B1 and A2B2 are a pair of orthogonal current 
bipoles used to simulate the tensorial resistivity survey. 
Each current bipole is assumed to be 19 m long, and a 
passive  0.5  m  long  dipole  is  supposed  to  be  moved  at 
steps of 0.5 m along crossed profiles spaced 0.5 m apart, 
within an area of 9×9 m2. A finite element program has 
been  edited  to  obtain  the  synthetic  apparent  resistivity 
response due to the model. Then, a total of 361 apparent 
resistivity  data  has  been processed  to  obtain  the  RAPT 
simulation. 

The top slice in Fig.2 shows the anomaly map of P, 
corresponding to the resistivity model of Fig.1. The data 
are  expressed  in  Ωm  and  the  contour  scale  is  reported 
on top. The following slices in the same figure show the 
RAPT images at various depths. The hosting half-space 

with resistivity 100 Ωm has been assumed as mod0. The 
horizontal slices are drawn every 0.5 m of depth beneath 
the survey surface. The RAOP contour scale is drawn at 
the  bottom.  The  RAPT  images  show  a  positive  RAOP 
nucleus  exactly  in  correspondence  with  the  position  of 
the resistive body. The highest ηq values occur at 2.5 m 
below the survey plane. The slices show also a negative 
RAOP  nucleus  extending  downward  exactly  below  the 
conductive composite body. The lowest ηq values occur 
at 1.5 m beneath the survey surface. 
 

 
A synthetic example: the two-block model immersed 
Figure 1 
in a uniform half-space. A1B1 and A2B2 represent the orthogonal 
energizing current bipoles. 

 

 

This example shows that the RAPT method is quite 
able to distinguish two adjacent bodies with contrasting 
resistivity, and to locate the equivalent physical sources 
of the anomalies at a position underground, nearly cor-
responding with the barycentre of the bodies. To better 
appreciate the resolving power of the new method, fig.3 
shows, for comparison, the tomographic slices obtained 
by considering only the central resistive prism. It can be 
observed that, except for the values of ηq which are now 
greater than those in fig.2 at the same points, the pattern 
of the whole ηq representation is quite similar to that in 
fig.2. This means that if the target had been the central 
prism,  its  identification  pattern  would  have  not  been 
dramatically  distorted  by  the  presence  of  the  lateral 
disturbing prism with contrasting resistivity.

Tensorial resistivity tomography 

A FIELD EXAMPLE 

 
Site description 
 
In  the  Sabine  necropolis  at  Colle  del  Forno,  located  in 
the Tiber valley, 30 km north of Rome, Italy, a site not 
yet exploited was chosen to test the applicability of the 
new 3D tomography method in an actual archaeological 
context. The same area was previously explored to test a 
former  geoelectrical  tomographic  method  based  on  the 
concept  of  charge  occurrence  probability  (Mauriello  et 
al.,  1998).  The  existence  of  hypogeal  dromos-chamber 
tombs was strongly supported by integrated geophysical 
surveys, including the self-potential, dipole geoelectrics, 
ground penetrating radar and differential magnetometry 
methods (Cammarano et al., 1997 a,b; 1998). 
 
 

 

Figure 3 
Simulated  resistivity  source  element  3D  probability 
tomography for a single prism model, corresponding with the red 
block in fig.1. The slice at the top is the synthetic survey map of 
the trace of the apparent resistivity tensor. 
 
 

Fig.4 displays sketched plan and section views of a 
standard tomb in the Sabine necropolis (Santoro, 1977). 
It consists of two distinct volumes. The main body is the 
tomb chamber with a standard volume of 2×2×2 m3. Its 
roof is normally found at an average depth of 1 m b.g.l.. 
The accessory structure is a downward sloping corridor 
(dromos), up to 6 m long and with a mean 1×1 m2 cross-
section. The tombs were excavated in a uniform layer of 
lithoid tuff with a mean thickness of 10 m, characterized 
by  a  resistivity  value  in  the  range  20-30  Ωm.  The  tuff 
layer overlies a thick Pleistocene-Quaternary sands and 
clays alternate sequence, and is covered by a 20-30 cm 
thick  clayey-sandy  top  soil.  The  tomb  chambers  have 
generally  been  found  in  a  good  state  of  conservation, 
sometimes  partially  filled  with  loose  sediments,  while 
the dromos have  almost  always  been found  completely

was  first  moved  with  a  sampling  step  of  0.5  m  along 
parallel straight profiles in the N-S direction, spaced 0.5 
m  apart.  Then,  a  second  set  of  data  was  collected  with 
the M1N1 dipole moved along parallel straight profiles in 
the  E-W  direction,  again  spaced  0.5  m  apart.  The  two 
sets allowed the electric field vector E1 to be determined 
at the nodes of the profile grid. Accordingly, the second 
A2B2 current layout was an E-W 19 m long bipole, again 
crossing symmetrically the area. The same procedure as 
before  was  utilised  to  collect  at  the  same  points  of  the 
profile grid the data useful for the determination of the

In synthesis, we are faced with a two-body problem, 
featured, at least in principle, as a highly resistive body 
(the totally or partially void tomb chamber) joined with 
a conductive body (the completely filled dromos), both 
enclosed in a nearly uniform medium with intermediate 
resistivity.  A  close  similarity  can  be  observed  between 
the model of fig.4 and the synthetic model of fig.1. 
 
 
Field technique 
 
We  employed  a  low-frequency  AC  energizing  unit.  A 
current of amplitude 100 mA and frequency 128 Hz was 
injected  into  the  ground,  and  the  potential  drops  ∆φi  at 
the same frequency were measured across a 0.5 m long 
dipole.  The  apparent  resistivities  were  computed  using 
the standard formula for DC geoelectrics, since the ratio 
of  the  survey  probing  length  (14  m  at  most)  to  the 
current  wavelength  (140  m  at  least,  in  a  minimum  10 
Ωm resistivity environment) was quite negligible, of the 
order of 10%, at most. In other words, we admit that in 
the  quasi-static  limit  in  which  we  carried  out  the  field 
experiment,  the  current  density  J  can  be  considered  a 
divergence-free vector as in DC geoelectrics. 

The  first  A1B1  current  layout  for  the  experimental 
determination of the apparent resistivity tensor was a 19 
m long bipole spread along the N-S median axis of the 
9×9 m2 survey area, symmetrically on one and the other 
side  (see  top  slice  in  fig.5).  The  M1N1  potential  dipole

necropolis at Colle del Forno near Rome, Italy. 

 
 
Results and discussion 
 
The anomaly map of the rotational invariant P obtained 
by this procedure is drawn in the bottom slice of Fig.5. 
A couple of anomalies with opposite trend appears very 
well defined in the central-western sector of the survey 
area.  In  total  agreement  with  the  results  from  previous 
surveys (Cammarano et al., 1997, 1998), the large high 
of the P invariant (red anomaly) is ascribed to the main 
chamber  of  the  Sabine  tomb.  Accordingly,  the  narrow 
low of the P invariant (blue anomaly) is associated with 
the  entrance  corridor  (dromos),  completely  filled  with 
loose sediments. 

Before illustrating the RAPT imaging, it may result 
quite interesting to show the greater performance of the 
apparent resistivity tensor method compared with that of 
the traditional scalar apparent resistivity method.

Tensorial resistivity tomography 

 

Figure 6 
A field example. The apparent resistivity tensor map 
above the dromos-chamber tomb in the Sabine necropolis at Colle 
del  Forno,  Rome,  Italy  (bottom  slice),  compared  with  the  scalar 
apparent  resistivity  maps  for  the  E-W  (left  top  slice)  and  N-S 
(right top slice) polarizations of the AB current source layout. 

 

 
 

The distortion due to the polarization of each single 
AB electric current line is quite evident. A deflation and 
an inflation of the anomalies occur respectively parallel 
and  perpendicular  to  the  main  direction  of  the  primary 
current flow. On  the  contrary,  the  combined  use of  the 
two  AB  polarization  for  the  determination  of  the  trace 
of  the  apparent  resistivity  tensor provides a  completely 
distortion-free map with more confined anomalies over 
the source bodies. 

For the tomographic elaboration we have assumed as 
mod0 a uniform half-space with a resistivity of 24 Ωm, 
equal to the average resistivity of the lithoid tuff about 
the  current  electrodes.  In  Fig.7,  the  sequence  of  slices 
below  the  anomaly  map  show  the  RAOP  tomography 
every  0.25  m  from  the  ground  level  down  to  3.5  m  of 
depth.  Only  values  of η(rq)  exceeding  in  modulus  0.3 
have  been  reported.  The  first  evidence  is  the  positive 
RAOP nucleus in the central part, which unequivocally 
indicates the existence of the empty tomb chamber with 
the position of its barycentre placed, as expected, within 
the  depth  range  1.5-2  m  b.g.l.,  where  the  highest η(rq) 
values occur. The second signal is the negative nucleus 
in  the  central-western  side  of  the  slices,  which  would 
thus  highlight  the  entrance  corridor  to  the  tomb,  filled 
with  conductive  sandy-clayey  sediments.  However,  the 
lowest η(rq) values appear concentrated around 2.5 m of 
depth, well beyond the expected depth of the barycentre 
of the dromos structure. Very likely, the minimum at 2.5 
m of depth would most properly indicate the area where 
resistivity  reaches  its  lowest  value  inside  the  corridor, 
due  to  an  increased  accumulation  of  water  in  the  basal 
clayey-sandy deposit.

CONCLUSION 

 
The  3D  probability  tomography  previously  developed 
for the scalar resistivity method has been here extended 
to the 2D tensorial apparent resistivity acquisition mode. 
It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  trace  of  the  apparent 
resistivity tensor provides distortion-free maps with the 
anomalies closely confined on the source bodies. Such a 
property strongly enhance the performance of the high-
resolution,  target-oriented  probability  tomography  that 
has been proposed in this paper. 

The new tomography method has the advantage that, 
in  principle,  no  strict  reference  to  the  geometry  of  the 
sources of anomaly is needed as an a priori constraint to 
start  with  the  imaging  algorithm.  It  only  relates  to  the 
pure physical aspects of the electrical stimulation of the 
buried structures. The use of a probability parameter for 
resistivity pattern recognition underground is thought to 
be unavoidable. Indeed, due to intrinsic equivalence and

cultural and/or natural noise contamination sources, the 
search for a deterministic solution of the true shape and 
size  of  target  bodies  has  basically  much  less  common-
sense than it is believed.

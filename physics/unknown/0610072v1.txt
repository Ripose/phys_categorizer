Abstract :  
 

We  report  the  first  demonstration  to  our  knowledge  of  a  continuously  tunable  picosecond  laser  operating 
around 1 MHz. The emission  can be tuned from 640 to 685 nm and the repetition rate from 200 kHz to 1 MHz with a 
pulse duration of less than 200 ps. The system is based on a Nd:YVO4 passively Q-switched microchip laser providing 
a few tens of nJ per pulse. Two cascaded stages of amplification are then used to increase the pulse energy to several 
µJ . The frequency doubled radiation is then used to pump a periodically-poled-niobate-lithium (PPLN)-based optical 
parametric  generator  in  an  all-solid-state  architecture.  20  nJ  of  tunable  signal  radiation  are  obtained.  We  also 
demonstrated 300-ps pulses generation in the UV (355 nm) at 1 MHz. 
 
 

Many applications in biology such as fluorescence lifetime measurements, detection of single molecules or 
optical  tomography  by  time  correlated  single  photon  counting  require  pulsed  laser  sources  emitting  visible 
radiations. As the fluorescence lifetime of numerous molecules is less than a nanosecond, short pulses (around one 
hundred  of  picosecond)  are  needed.  The  repetition  rate  of  the  laser  source  used  is  an  important  parameter  in 
experiments using photon counting detection chains : indeed, high repetition rates ensure a fast acquisition process 
of the fluorescence decay signal and allow to study of dynamic processes. However, the complex signal processing 
devices could not support repetition rates above several MHz without problems during the acquisition of the data. 
Consequently a repetition rate of 1 MHz seems to be a good requirement for this kind of applications. Another very 
important  characteristic  is  the  tunability  of  the  source:  in  order  to  study  different  chemical  species  with  the  same 
laser source, it is very interesting to be able to change the wavelength easily on a broad range. There is consequently 
a strong need for tunable sources operating at 1 MHz in a compact and simple package. 
A fruitful approach to generate short visible pulses is to use a master oscillator power amplifier system operating in 
the  near-infrared  and  to use non-linear processes  to  reach  the  visible  range.  Recent  developments  in  passively  Q-
switched  microchip  lasers  [1,2]  open  the  way  to  a  large  number  of  studies  on  very  compact  and  efficient  pulsed 
sources [3-7]. Nevertheless, the repetition rates of the published devices are almost always in the kilohertz range. 
Moreover the poor efficiency of non linear materials at weak peak powers makes the development of MHz sources 
somewhat  difficult.  An  interesting  and  successful  approach  is  to  use  a  fiber-based  architecture  and  quasi-phase 
matched non-linear materials [8]. 
In  this  paper  we  present  another  solution  based  essentially  on  bulk  elements  to  demonstrate  a  compact  source 
providing 45 nm of continuous tunability around 660 nm with less than 200 ps long pulses. To this end, we used a 
Nd:YVO4 passively Q-switched amplified microchip laser operating at 1 MHz to pump a periodically poled lithium 
niobate optical parametric generator. We also demonstrate 50 mW of  355 nm radiation by frequency tripling the 
same microlaser. 
 
Motivated  by  compactness  and  simplicity  we  chose  as  master  oscillator  a  microchip  Nd:YVO4  laser.  We  used  a 
semiconductor  saturable  absorber  mirror  to  passively  Q-switch  the  laser  [9].  The  repetition  rate  range  and  the 
duration of the pulses could then be adjusted by choosing the proper parameters for the SESAM and the design of 
the cavity.  
It can be shown that the pulse duration is directly proportional to the length of the cavity, which led us to design a 
very short cavity (a few hundreds micrometers) to get sub-nanosecond pulses. We used a 200 µm thick laser crystal 
with an antireflection coating at 1064 nm on its faces. The saturable absorber had a modulation depth of 6% and we 
used several output couplers between 4 and 10 %. The crystal used was a 3% doped Nd:YVO4 and was sandwiched 
between the saturable absorber and the output coupler as described on figure 1.

To improve the compactness of the system, we use the same laser diode to pump the microchip laser and the power 
amplifier : the beam of a 200 µm-wide 20 W fiber-coupled laser diode at 808 nm was divided into two parts : about 
1 W was taken to pump the microchip laser via a small mirror placed in the path of the laser diode beam as shown 
on  figure  3,  while  the  rest  of  the  laser  diode  beam  (19  W)  was  used  to  pump  the  power  amplifier.  This  setup 
provided simplicity, compactness and reducing the global cost. It also allows us to use a high brightness pump beam 
for  the  microchip  laser  :  to  give  an  order  of  magnitude,  the  microchip  pump  beam  is  equivalent  in  terms  of 
brightness to the beam coming from a fiber coupled laser diode providing 9 W with a numerical aperture of 0.2 and 
an emitting area of 200 µm in diameter, which is more than 4 times as bright as the pump diodes generally used for 
this kind of devices [2]. The radius of the pump spot on the microchip was around 30 µm. 
 
We obtained single-frequency Q-switched sub-nanosecond pulses and a repetition rate around 1 MHz for 200 mW 
of incident pump power. The repetition rate can be easily tuned from 200 kHz to 2 MHz by controlling the incident 
pump power with an iris whereas the pulse duration remained nearly constant as expected [1] : about 900 ps for the 
4% output coupler and 400 ps for the 10% coupler.  
The figure 2a summarizes the pulse durations and repetition rates obtained with two different output couplers. The 
pulse-to-pulse  timing  jitter  is  typically  2%  and  the  beam  was  not  diffraction  limited  (M2  =  2.2).  We  got  a  pulse 
energy of only 20 nJ and 60 nJ with the 4% and 10% output couplers respectively (figure 2b). The efficiency of non-
linear  processes  is  related  to  the  peak  power,  and  such  energies  correspond  to  obviously  too  low  peak  powers  – 
about 100 W - for efficient frequency conversion. Amplification stages are therefore needed to scale this peak power 
towards the multi-kilowatt level. 
As  our goal was  to  reach very  short pulses (some  hundreds  of  picoseconds  maximum)  with  a  repetition rate  of 1 
MHz, we chose the 10% output coupler for the following experiments. 
The 3D multipass amplifier used in our system was described in details in ref. 10. The laser beam made 6 passes 
(only  4  are  represented  on  figure  3)  in  a  10  mm-long  0.1%  doped  Nd:YVO4  crystal  in  three  different  planes  of 
incidence to optimise the overlap between the laser beam path and the pumped volume. The use of both low-doped 
and  relatively  long  crystal  allows  a  better  distribution  of  the  pump  power  inside  the  gain  medium,  leading  to  a 
weaker  and  less  aberrating  thermal  lens  when  compared  with  more  doped  crystals.  It  also  authorises  a  higher 
pumping level (up to 20 W in our case) without fracture problems. 
 
The power amplifier is pumped with the laser diode described below (see figure 2). With an average power of 40 
mW  from the microchip laser injected into the 3D multipass amplifier, we obtained 2.8 W (corresponding to a peak 
power of  about 5.6 kW) at the output of the amplifier. The repetition rate, the pulse length and the pulse-to-pulse 
stability were preserved after amplification.  
However  the  spatial  beam  quality  is  again  slightly  degraded  in  the  amplifier,  leading  to  likely  poor  frequency 
conversion efficiency. Moreover, at this level of input power all the energy stored in the amplifying crystal was not 
extracted  in  the  3D  amplifier  :  in  order  to  improve  the  amplification,  and  to  spatially  filter  in  the  same  time  the 
microchip  laser  beam,  a  commercial  (Keopsys,  model  KPS-GB-YFA-27-FA)  ytterbium  doped  fiber  preamplifier 
was placed between the microchip laser and the multipass amplifier. This preamplifier worked in a saturated regime, 
providing more than 100 mW of output average power for a large range of input powers from 100 µW to several 
milliwatts.  The  output  average  power  obtained  after  the  preamplifier-amplifier  system  was  4  W  of  1064  nm  
radiation.  Another  advantage  of  the  YDFA  preamplifier  is  that  this  output  powers  remained  constant  whatever 
repetition rate was used, and the beam was now quasi-diffraction limited (M² = 1.2). 
We used a periodically poled KTP to perform single-pass second harmonic generation from 1064 to 532 nm. The 
PPKTP was 10 mm long and placed in an oven to control the temperature. The 1064 nm laser beam is focused by a 
150  mm  lens  to  a  waist  radius  of  50  µm.  For  3.7  W  of  incident  power  we  obtained  1.4  W  at  532  nm  (38  %  of 
efficiency). The pulse duration was slightly reduced during the frequency doubling process (from 500 ps to 400 ps, 
see figure 5).  
 
We then used this 532 nm radiation to pump an optical parametric generator (OPG) based on a quasi-phase-matched 
crystal in order to perform continuous tunability in the red part of the spectrum around 660 nm. In this purpose we 
chose  a  periodically-poled  lithium  niobate  crystal  (PPLN)  because  of  its  exceptionally  high  effective  non-linear 
coefficient of 17 pm/V. Such PPLN-based OPG configurations had already been successfully investigated in the ns 
regime with low repetition rates [5-7]. 
The PPLN crystal was 3 cm-long and consisted in 5 parallel gratings. The five periods were 9, 9.25, 9.5, 9.75 and 10 
µm, each with a width of 1 mm and a height of 0.5 mm. The end faces of the crystal were uncoated, giving rise to 14 
% Fresnel reflection losses from each face. The crystal was placed in an oven to avoid photorefractive damage and 
to control precisely the temperature. The nominal temperature was 90 °C to obtain phase-matching at 660 nm (the 
idler being 2743 nm in this case) for the 9.5 µm-period grating.

The 532-nm pump laser was focused at the center of the non-linear crystal to a 50 µm waist radius by a 150-mm lens 
(figure 3).. The oven containing the PPLN could be easily pushed sideways via a micrometric screw to choose one 
of the five gratings.  
The  temperature  of  the  oven  could  also  be  tuned  from  30°C  to  150  °C  to  complete  continuous  tunability  for  the 
signal from 640 to 685 nm (3.15 µm to 2.38 µm for the idler) as shown on figure 4. A slight discrepancy between 
the  experimental  data  and  the  theoretical  fit  based  on  the  published  Sellmeier  equation  [11]  is  observed.  Some 
imprecision could affect the values : errors in the knowledge of the Sellmeier law giving the different indexes, on 
the  exact  temperature  and  on  the  period  of  the  gratings.  We  estimated  a  global  potential  error  on  the  signal 
wavelength around 1.1 nm, which makes the experimental data and theoretical results consistent. However, a more 
detailed study should be necessary to explain the slight slope difference between experiment and theory. 
With 1.2 W of pump power at a repetition rate of 1 MHz and with a pulse duration of 400 ps (corresponding to a 
peak power of 2kW), the signal average power was only 15 mW. The OPG operated in fact just above its threshold 
which was found to be 1.4 kW of peak power. The low efficiency could be explained by the not-well-understood 
effects  that  affect  the  PPLN  when  pumped  in  the  visible  at  relatively  high  average  powers  [12-14].  Indeed,  we 
previously  performed  with  our  PPLN  an  OPG  experiment  using  a  commercial  (DualChip  by  JDS  Uniphase) 
frequency-doubled  microchip  laser  [15].  In  that  case  the  repetition  rate  was  only  40  kHz  and  the  average  power 
around  100  mW,  leading  to  comparable  peak  powers.  The  results  obtained  were  consistent  with  the  better 
comparable published results, confirming the relatively good quality of the poling of our PPLN sample. In the setup 
operating  at  1  MHz,  the  much  higher  average  power  induced  beam  distortion  and  even  local  bulk  damage, 
consequently leading to a decrease of the efficiency. The pulse duration of the signal is strongly reduced to less than 
200 ps (limited by the rise time of our measurement setup) as shown on figure 5, because of the OPG exponential 
gain expression in the high-gain regime.  
Those results were obtained with the 9.5-µm grating, but the thresholds and efficiencies were the same for the five 
different gratings, since the idler’s wavelength remained always under 4 µm were the lithium niobate absorbs laser 
energies.  
 
A large number of biological molecules have to be excited by ultraviolet pulses, which induces a great interest of 
UV laser sources which short pulses durations (typically 100 ps) and high repetition rate. To efficiently frequency 
double  the red  radiation,  we could use UV-transparent quasi  phase  matched  crystals  as  periodically  poled  lithium 
tantalate,  but  such  crystals  are  not  easily  grown  [12]  because  of  the  short  period  required  and  at  this  time  not 
commercially available.  However we performed frequency tripling of our amplified microchip laser system with a 
bulk LBO crystal to obtain a 355 nm UV radiation.  We separate the green and infrared beams in order to rotate the 
1064 nm polarisation of 90 degrees to get type II phase matching in a 7 mm-long LBO crystal. With 1.1 W of 532 
nm and 1.6 W of 1064 nm radiation we obtained only 50 mW of ultraviolet radiation because of unoptimized design. 
We haven’t measure the temporal width of the ultraviolet pulses because our photodiodes are not sensitive enough in 
this  range  of  wavelength,  however  theoretical  considerations  shows  that  the  UV  width  should  be  around  300  ps. 
Great improvement in terms of efficiency and tunability could be obtained by the use of periodically poled lithium 
tantalate to perform THG and to frequency double the output of the OPG respectively. The later point will allow us 
to get a picosecond laser source with large tunability around 330 nm at high repetition rate, which is of great interest 
for many biological studies.  
 
In  conclusion,  we  demonstrate  what  is  to  our  knowledge  the  first  compact  diode-pumped  sub-nanosecond  source 
providing continuous tunability over 45 nm in the red range of the spectrum (around 660 nm) with a high repetition 
rate of 1 MHz. This source could be frequency doubled to reach tunability around 330 nm with the same temporal 
characteristics. We also get 300 ps pulses at 355 nm with the same repetition rate and expect to reach in a near future.

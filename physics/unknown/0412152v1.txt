Abstract.  It  is  shown  that  fine  structure  of  distributions  of  fluctuations  in  different  processes 
depends  on  position  of  the  Earth  with  respect  of  the  Moon.  The  same  form  of  histogram  was 
observed at New Moon moment independently of geographic position of laboratory and local time. 
Possible origin of the phenomenon is discussed.

1 Introduction 
Even precise measurements produce scattered results. Traditionally, this scattering is viewed as an 
undesirable  phenomenon.  When  scattered  results  are  analyzed,  peaks  and  troughs  in  their 
distribution  (histogram)  is  commonly  neglected,  because  they  are  assumed  to  result  from  random 
fluctuations.  Commonly  accepted  procedures  for  the  statistical  treatment  of  the  results  of 
measurements involve smoothing of this fine structure and approximating histograms by Gaussian 
or Poisson distributions [1-3] 
However,  we  have  shown  that  the  fine  structure  of  histograms  representing  distributions  of  the 
results of measurements of a variety of processes, from biochemical reactions to radioactive decay, 
is  not  random  and  depends  on  cosmophysical  factors  [4-  13].  The  shape  of  these  histograms  is  a 
manifestation of the fundamental properties of our world. 
An adequate object for investigating these properties is radioactive decay, a process that a fortiori is 
not subject to trivial ”terrestrial” influences. In view of this, we studied, in the course of the last 20 
years,  the  regularities  of  changes  in  the  shape  of  histograms  representing  the  results  of 
measurements  of  α-decay  of  239Pu  specimens  rigidly  mounted  on  semiconductor  detectors.  The 
results of long-term ”round-the-clock” measurements of the number of acts of radioactive decay per 
unit 
in  computer  archives.  We  constructed  histograms  from 
nonoverlapping consecutive fragments of the time series. To facilitate visualization, the histograms 
were  smoothed  by  moving  summation.  When  shapes  of  histograms  are  compared,  their  extension 
and  compression  along  the  abscissa  axis,  as  well  as  and  rotation  about  the  vertical  axis  (mirror 
image), are allowed. These procedures are performed using a software tool [8]. 
A  study  of  the  time  series  from  which  the  histograms  were  built  by  conventional  mathematical 
methods indicates that, as it might be expected, radioactive decay is a quite random process, which 
obeys the Poisson statistics. However, the shape of the histograms is not random. Comparison of the 
shapes of histograms in many thousands of pairwise combinations revealed the following patterns: 
(1) ”Near-zone effect” - histograms of a particular shape are often observed successively; 

time  have  been  deposited 

 

1

(2) ”Cosmophysical  periodicity”  -  histograms  of  a  particular  shape  often  appear  with 
periodicity of 24 h (”solar day”), 23 h 56 min (”sidereal day”), approximately 27 days, and 
365 days; 

(3) ”Synchronous  on  local  time  scale”  -  histograms  of  similar  shapes  constructed  from  the 
results  of  independent  measurements  of  diverse  processes  (from  biochemical  reactions  to 
radioactive  decay)  performed  at  remote  geographical  locations,  are  often  observed  at  the 
same local time. 

However extravagant these results may look, they do not contradict the basic concepts of physics. 
The  general  picture  of  the  world  has  been  formed  as  a  result  of  studies  of  changes  in  measured 
quantities. Our studies deal with changes in the fine structure of distributions of the results of these 
measurements. These changes are of universal character and are not related to the scale of energy 
transformation in a particular process. 
Here we show that the fine structure of histograms constructed from the measurements of the alpha-
activity of  239Pu and the gamma-activity of  137Cs is largely determined by the mutual positions of 
the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun. The effect is most pronounced during the New-Moon period. 
 
2 Results 
Fig.  1  -  Fig.  8  presents  a  series  of  21  histograms,  each  constructed  from  the  results  of  60  2-s 
measurements  of  the  alpha-activity  of  239Pu  specimens  rigidly  fixed  on  a  semiconductor  detector 
performed in different laboratories in different geographical points during eight New-Moon periods 
in  2000  and  2001.  Each  histogram  corresponds  to  a  2-min  interval.  On  the  abscissa  of  each 
histogram  is  the  radioactivity  in  imp/2s.  On  the  ordinate  is  the  frequency  of  occurrence  of  this 
activity value. The mean radioactivity is 870 imp/2s. Histograms of the shape characteristic of the 
New Moon period (called hereinafter ”New-Moon histogram”) are presented in the middle of each 
series  (shown  in  red).  For  convenience  of  visual  comparison,  the  histograms  were  smoothed  15 
times by moving summation [8-10,12]. The numbers on the figures denote the ordinal numbers of 
successive histograms.

Pushchino  (in  latitude  54050’  North,  in  longitude  37038’  East).  The  New  Moon  was  at  3h  39min 
(Greenwich). Histogram no. 150 corresponds to this time. The ”New-Moon histogram” in this case 
has number 153 (is shown in red), i.e., was observed 6 min later.

numbers 432 and 434, i. e., are observed 4 min earlier and exactly at the New Moon. 
 
 
It  is  evident  from  this  series  of  figures  that,  during  the  New  Moon  ,  ”New-Moon  histogram”  is 
observed  almost  simultaneously  at  different  geographical  points,  regardless  of  the  season  and  the 
position of the Moon relative to the horizon at a given geographical point. 
Superposition of histograms on a series of Fig. 9 - Fig. 13 clearly demonstrates a similarity of the 
histograms at the onset of the New Moon period at different geographical points. 
Fig.  9  shows  a  superposition  of  the  histograms  constructed  from  the  results  of  measurements  of 
239Pu alpha-radioactivity in Pushchino at the onset of the New Moon period on July 31, 2000 (no. 
153) and on June 21, 2001 (no. 669). Their similarity illustrates a uniformity of histogram forms at 
the New Moon at different times; the interval in this case was 11 months. 
Fig.  10  shows  a  synchronism  in  the  occurrence  of  single-type  histograms  upon  measurements  of

This  effect  is  observed  upon  measurements  of  processes  of  different  nature,  including  the 
measurements  of  α-radioactivity  of  137Cs  (in  Dubna)  and  measurements  of  earth-crust  oscillations 
near the Lake Baikal using a laser interferometer. 
Thus, at the New-Moon, simultaneously (to an accuracy of 2-10 min) in different geographic 
points throughout the Earth, the same characteristic fine structure of distribution is observed 
upon measurements of processes of different nature. It is of great importance that attempts to 
detect a similar effect during the Full Moon periods have not been successful. 
 
3 Discussion 
3.0.1 Is this phenomenon real? 
In  all,  we  examined  the  form  of  histograms  during  76  New-Moon  periods.  For  63  of  them, 
histograms of a characteristic shape were observed. The probability of accidental occurrence of the 
histogram of a particular shape just in the new-moon period was estimated as follows. We determine 
the  number  of  histograms  (m)  similar  to  a  characteristic  histogram  in  the  entire  massive  of  N 
histograms. Then the value of k (the difference between the calculated number of the histogram and 
the number of the histogram characteristic for the New Moon obtained in this case) is determined; 
e.g. the calculated number of the histogram must be 150, however, the histogram characteristic of 
the  New  Moon  in  this  case  has  number  153  as  it  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  Then  the  probability  P  of 
accidental  occurrence  of  the  histogram  of  a  characteristic  form  (”New-Moon-form”)  in  this 
geographical point will be: 

P = m · k/N.                                   (1) 
Given  the  time  of  constructing  one  histogram  to  be  2  min,  the  number  of  histograms  that  can  be 
constructed during 24 h is 720. The number of histograms of the ”New-Moon-form”(shown in red in 
a  series  of  Fig.  1  -  Fig.  8)  varies  in  different  experiments  from  2  to  12  during  24  h.  Hence,  the 
probability  of  accidental  occurrence  of  this  particular  form  just  in  the  New-Moon  period  in  each 
particular case will be from P1 = 1.4·10-2 to P2 = 8 ·10-2 (m1 = 2; m2 = 12; k = 5; N = 720). The total 
probability of obtaining the same result upon repeating the measurements is equal to the product of 

 

9

probabilities  calculated  for  individual  experiments.  Obviously,  the  probability  of  an  accidental 
occurrence of the effect in several independent experiments is negligibly small. Thus, even for three 
experiments P is as low as 10-3. The probability of a random occurrence of this result can also be 
estimated  using  Fig.  1.  For  illustration,  21  histograms  for  each  experiment  are  presented  in  the 
figure. As a rule, there is only one (more rarely two) characteristic histogram among them. Then the 
probability of obtaining a random result in each individual experiment is as low as 2.5·10-1. Clearly, 
the  probability  of  a  random  8-fold  recurrence  of  this  result  is  extremely  low  (~2·10-7).  Since  this 
effect was observed in 63 out of 76 experiments during the New-Moon periods, the effect must be 
real. 
3.1 Possible explanation of the ”New-Moon effect” 
Studies of the patterns in the occurrence of histograms of particular shapes led us to conclude that 
there is a universal external ”reason” that determines the fine structure of distributions of the results 
of measurements of diverse processes. The only common feature of all the processes studied is that 
they occur in one and the same space-time. In view of this it was proposed that the regular changes 
(we  call  them  as  ”macroscopic  fluctuations”)  in  the  fine  structure  of  histograms  are  due  to 
corresponding  changes  (oscillations)  in  space-time  ”on  a  global  scale”  [7,10,11].  If  it  were  so,  it 
would be natural to assume that the original cause of these phenomena in general is a gravitational 
inhomogeneities (fluctuations), which become evident upon the rotation of the Earth around its axis 
(from  whence  ”solar”  and  ”sidereal”  day;  the  occurrence  of  similar  independent  processes  at  the 
same  local  time)  and  the  movement  of  the  Earth  along  its  circumsolar  orbit  (whence  a  yearly 
period). The periods of 27 and 29.5 days suggest that mutual positions of the Earth, the Moon, and 
the Sun must also be taken into account [4-13]. 
We  believe  that  the  fine  structure  of  histograms  results  from  the  interference  of  some  wave 
processes  due  to  the  influence  of  celestial  bodies  .  The  failure  to  observe  similar  effects  in  Full 
Moon  periods  suggests  that  ”New-Moon  effect”  is  due  to  the  screening  effect  of  the  Sun  on  the 
Earth rather than to an increase in tidal forces. Virtually synchronous occurrence of a characteristic 
shape  of  histograms  during  the  New-Moon  periods  at  different  geographical  points  separated  by 
distances  approximately  equal  to  the  Earth’s  diameter  suggests  that  here  we  are  dealing  with  the 
disturbances propagating with a relativistic velocity.

Abstract 

Optical transfer functions are presented for the 4pi’ microscope. The effects of the size of the confocal pinhole on the three-
dimensional resolution are studied. It is shown that the resolution of the 4Pi’ microscope depends weakly on the pinhole size. 
This result suggest that the pinhole can be removed in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.

resolution.  Recently, 

Strong  efforts  have  been  made  for  increasing  the 
resolution  of  fluorescence  confocal  microscopes. 
Indeed,  fluorescence  microscopes  give  precious 
the 
information  about  biomedical 
volume of observation has to be as small as possible. 
Among  the  solutions  proposed,  the  4Pi  microscope 
[1,2] seems to be the most powerful tool for reducing 
the  axial  extent  of  the  investigation  volume  in 
fluorescence  experiments.  For  example  Egner  et  al. 
used  this  type  of  microscope  to  image  the  Golgi 
apparatus  in  live  mammalian  cells  [3]  with  a  ~100 
a  particular 
nm 
arrangement,  referred  as  4Pi’  microscope  [4],  has 
been proposed for increasing the lateral resolution of 
4Pi  microscopes  while  maintaining 
the  axial 
resolution  unchanged.  The  4Pi’  arrangement  is 
obtained  from  the  4Pi  microscope of    [1]  by  adding 
an  image  inversion  system  in  one  arm  of  the 
interferometer.  This  system  allows  creating  from  a 
point  source  –  typically  a  fluorophore  –  a  second 
virtual source. These two sources are symmetric with 
respect  to  the  common  focus  of  the  objective 
microscopes. The two beams emitted by the sources 
travel  across  the  two  arms  of  the  interferometer  and 
are superimposed on the confocal pinhole. The rules 
of geometrical optics show that the two images of the 
sources  are  symmetric  with  respect  to  the  centre  of 
the  pinhole.  The  superposition  of  these  two  images 
results  in  a  reduction  of  the  lateral  extent  of  the 
Molecular Detection Efficiency Function (MDEF). 

Interpretations  of  this  effect  have  been  given  in 
terms  of  geometrical  optics  [4].  In  order  to  give  a 

more  detailed  interpretation  and  for  studying  the 
influence  of  the  pinhole  size  on  the  resolution,  we 
have computed the optical transfer function (OTF) of 
the 4Pi’, of the 4Pi and of the confocal microscopes. 
Indeed, it has been shown [5,6] that the OTF allows 
to understand the influence of microscope parameters 
on the resolution and to study the properties of new 
types  of  microscopes  like  Teta  [7]  or  4Pi  [8] 
microscopes. 

2. Theory 

In  fluorescence  confocal  microscopy,  the  MDEF 
is  determined  by  the  product  of  the  Excitation 
Efficiency  Function  (EEF)  and  of  the  Collection 
Efficiency  Function 
In  a  one-photon 
(CEF). 
excitation  mode,  the  EEF  describes  the  intensity  of 
the  focused  pump  beam  which  illuminates  the 
sample.  If  we  don’t  consider  the  polarization  of  the 
pump  beam,  the  EEF  is  obtained  with  a  modified 
theory  [9]  of  Debye  and  Pitch  [10].  The  CEF  is  the 
intensity  received  by  the  photodetector  situated 
behind the pinhole. The CEF depends on the position 
of  the  fluorophore.  Numerical  calculations  of  the 
MDEF have been made with a one-photon excitation 
[4]  and  a  two-photon  excitation  [11]  regimes  by 
using the approach developed by Richards and Wolf 
[12] and later adapted by  Enderlein [13,14].

x  and  y  are  the  coordinates  in  the  transverse  plane. 
As  the  polarisation  of  the  pump  beam  is  not  taken 
into  account,  the  MDEF  is  symmetric  around  the 
optical  axis.  Thus  the  OTF  is  two-dimensional,

We have calculated the MDEF and the OTF of the 
4Pi’ microscope for different pinhole diameters φ. In 
the  calculations,  the  excitation  wavelength  λexc=488 
nm,  the  emission  wavelength  λfluo=525  nm.  These 
conditions  correspond  to  the  practical  case  of  an 
argon-ion  used  as  the  pump  source  and  Oregon 
Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) fluorophores.

magnification m=40 and the incident pump beam is a 
Gaussian  beam  with  β=1  [16].  These  conditions 
correspond  to  practical  cases  and  are  typical  of 
confocal  microscopes 
fluorescence 
experiments. With these characteristics, the diameter 
of the Airy function on the photodetector is equal to 
19.7 µm. Figure 1 shows the section of the MDEF in 
the  common  focal  plane  of  the  two  microscope 
objectives  calculated  for  different  pinhole  diameters 
φ:  one  well  adapted  to  the  Airy  spot  (φ=20  µm), 
another smaller (φ=10 µm), and another much larger 
(φ=40 µm).  A  comparison  is  drawn  between  the 
MDEF  of  the  4Pi  microscope  and  the  MDEF  of  the 
4Pi’ microscope. As expected, the maximum value of 
the MDEF increases when φ increases. Reducing the 
pinhole  size  leads  to  a  weaker  signal-to-noise  ratio. 
In  all  the  cases,  the  lateral  extent  of  the  MDEF  is 
smaller  for  the  4Pi’  microscope  than  for  the  4Pi 
microscope.  This  result  shows  that  a  better  lateral 
resolution  is  obtained  with  the  4Pi’  microscope. 
When  φ  tends  to  0,  the  two  systems  become 
equivalent. In order to discuss more precisely on the

origin  of  the  improvement  of  resolution  obtained 
with  the  4Pi’  microscope,  we  have  computed  the 
OTF.  The  results  are  represented  in  Figure  2.  For 
comparing  the  shapes  of  the  OTF  obtained  for 
different values of φ, we have normalized the results. 
One can see that, for the same value of φ, the OTF of 
the  4Pi’  microscope  is  broader  than  the  OTF  of  the 
4Pi  microscope.  In  particular,  the  amplitude  of  the 
OTF  of  the  4Pi’  microscope  is  stronger  at  high

frequencies.  This 
the 
improvement  of  the  lateral  resolution  obtained  with 
the  4Pi’  microscope.  Moreover  one  can  see  that  the 
shape  of  the  OTF  of  the  4Pi’  microscope  depends 
weakly on the pinhole size. This result suggests that 
the  pinhole  size  has  little  influence  on  the  lateral 
resolution  of  the  4Pi’  microscope.  This  result  is 
confirmed  (see  Table  1)  by  the  calculations  of  the 
lateral width of the MDEF.

microscopes. As increasing the pinhole size leads to 
an  improvement  of  the  signal-to-noise  ratio,  this 
property is a major advantage of the 4Pi’ microscope 
over  the  4Pi  microscope  and  the  classical  confocal 
microscope. Thus, 4Pi’ microscopes can be used with 
a  large  pinhole  or  even  without  any  pinhole  to 
observe weakly fluorescent biological samples.  

3.2. Axial resolution 

In Figure 3 we have represented the MDEF along 
the optical axis. Calculations have been made for the 
confocal  microscope  and  for  the  4Pi’  microscope.  
As we neglect the effects of polarization, the MDEF 
of the 4Pi’ microscope is equivalent to that of the 4Pi 
microscope  along  the  optical  axis.  One  can  see  the 
side-lobes obtained with  the 4Pi’  microscope  due  to 
the  interferences  between  the  incident  pump  beams 
and the interferences between the emitted beams. For 
the  conventional  confocal  microscope,  the  axial 
extent of the MDEF increases when the pinhole size 
increases.  On  the  other  hand,  the  pinhole  size  has 
little  influence  on  the  heights  of  the  first  side-lobes 
(see Table 2) obtained with the 4Pi’ microscope.

Introduction 
 
Investigation  of  model  stratum  corneum  (MSC)  lipid  structure  is  a  subject  of  interest  in 
pharmacology and dermatopharmacy as a  background for the  formulation of  new enhancer of 
drug penetration through human stratum corneum [1].   

The  determination  of  the  internal  lipid  membrane  structure  is  far  beyond  the  resolution  of 
light microscopy or light scattering [1]. Neutron scattering  in the range of wavelength 1-10 Å 
provides  better  spatial  resolution  of  an  internal  structure on the  scale  of  Ångströms.  It  allows 
determine  the  internal  membrane  structure  with  reasonable  accuracy.  Membrane  thickness, 
thickness  of  polar  head  groups,  thickness  of  methyl  and  methylene  groups,  surface  area  per 
lipid molecules, thickness of hydrophilic and hydrophobic membrane regions can be calculated 
from  scattering  experiment.  The  spatial  resolution  of  neutron  scattering  experiments  mainly 
depends on the possibility to collect a scattering curve in the wide range of scattering vector [2-
4]. The aim of the experiment is to determine the form factor of the membrane with maximum 
accuracy and further apply the model methods to calculate a membrane structure [5]. 

Three experimental methods can be used for this purpose, dependently on the possibility to 
prepare the relevant samples: neutron diffraction on the oriented multilamellar samples on the 
solid  substrate, neutron small-angle scattering (SANS) of  highly diluted vesicular systems (1-
10% w/w), and neutron reflectivity on the lipid bilayer on the silicon substrate at water excess. 

Information about the internal membrane structure can be obtained from neutron diffraction 
experiments on oriented planar multilamellar systems, which are partially dehydrated [7]. This 
method is more appropriate for the modulation of physiological conditions of human skin. The 
experimental  resolution  depends  on  the  number  of  detected  diffraction  peaks,  connected  with 
possibility to prepare the highly oriented multilamellar system on the solid substrate.  

Small-angle  neutron  scattering  is  the  best  method  to  study  a  membrane  structure  of  the 
highly  diluted  unilamellar  or  oligolamellar  vesicular  systems.  In  the  case  of  MSC  study,  the 
small-angle  scattering  technique  can  be  applied  for  systems  where  the  possibility  to  prepare 
highly oriented planar multilamellar systems is limited, or as the complementary method. First 
efforts to investigate the internal membrane structure of oligolamellar vesicles via SANS gave 
about  1.5 Å  accuracy  of  the  membrane  thickness  determination,  accuracy  of  2 Å  of  the 
hydrophobic core determination, and new information about membrane hydration [4]. 

The  separated  form  factors  approach  (SFF)  was  developed  for  the  characterization  of  the 
unilamelar  vesicles  with  diameter  ‡
  500 Å  via  SANS  [8-11].  The  application  of  fluctuated 
membrane  model  in  the  framework  of  the  SFF  shows  that  scattering  density  from  D2O 
distribution function inside of hydrophilic region dominates under that from polar head groups 
[12].  Hence,  one  can  expect  that  the  hydrophilic-hydrophobic  model  (HH-model)  with  the 
linear r (x) function of the neutron scattering length density across membrane in the hydrophilic 

region can provide realistic and simple approximation of the  lipid  membrane structure. In the 
HH-model,  only  two  fit  parameters  (thickness  of  membrane  d,  and  thickness  of  hydrophobic 
region D) are needed to simulate r (x) function. This approach sufficiently improves the fitting 
convergence  relative  to  the  more  complex  models  of  r (x).  The  same  approximation  of  the 
scattering  length  neutron  density  r (x)  has  been  applied  in  [6]  for  an  oligolamellar  POPC 
vesicles study [13].  

In  present  study,  the  parameters  of  the  polydispersed  unilamellar  vesicle  population  are 
analyzed  on  the  basis  of  the  separated  form-factors  model  for  three  different  type  of 
membranes. The neutron scattering length density across the membrane is simulated on the base 
of the HH-model with the linear water distribution.  

 
Experiment, sample preparation, and methods 
 
SANS  measurements  were  carried  out  at  YuMO  time-of-flight  spectrometer  in  JINR 
(Dubna), at Yellow Submarine spectrometer at study state reactor in Budapest, and at SANS-I 
spectrometer of spallation neutron source at PSI (Switzerland).  

Unilamellar  vesicles  were  prepared  via  extrusion  of  multilamellar  vesicle    suspension 

(liposomes) in D2O through polycarbonate filters with pore diameter 500 Å.  

SFF  model  was  applied  to  describe  a  vesicle  form  and  internal  membrane  structure.  This 
approach allows to simulate the scattering length density of neutrons across the bilayer by any 
integrable  function [8]. In this study, the scattering  length density r (x) across the bilayer was 
simulated by the HH approximation (see Fig. 1). The scattering density of hydrocarbon chains 
r CH  was  fixed  as  - 0.36(cid:215) 1010  (cid:0)
.  [4].    Parameters  of  the  DMPC  vesicle 
population  (average  radius  <R>,  polydispersity  s
,  membrane  thickness  d,  thickness  of 
hydrophobic  part  D)  were  restored  only  from  the  SANS  spectra,  without  additional 
experimental  methods  (light  scattering,  diffraction,  etc.).  Additionally,  in  the  case  of  known 
molecular  volume,  the  number  of  water  molecules  per  one  lipid  molecule  in  the  membrane 
bilayer Nw and area per one lipid molecule A can be calculated.

Results and discussions 
 
The scattering curve from polydispersed DMPC vesicle population was collected at YuMO 
spectrometer in the q range from qmin=0.0084 Å-1 to qmax=0.2 Å-1. Incoherent background was 
fixed parameter IB=0.00546 cm-1. The scattering curve from the same sample was collected at 
SANS-I spectrometer at PSI in the q range from qmin= 0.0033 Å-1 to qmax=0.56 Å-1. Incoherent 
background was a  free parameter in this case. Calculated vesicles parameters are presented in 
Table 1. Parameters obtained from the both instruments are in good agreement, but an accuracy 
of  the  parameter  evaluation  is  better  from  PSI-I  spectra  because  of  wide  q-range  at  SANS-I 
instrument.  Important  advantage  of  SANS-I  spectrometer  is  the  possibility  to  collect  data  at 
q>0.2Å-1 and fit the value of incoherent background IB.  

The  membrane  parameters  derived  from  the  unilamellar  vesicles:  d=49.6Å,  D=18.6Å, 
A=61.4Å2, and Nw=14.1 are sufficiently different from that obtained from X-ray diffraction on 
the multilamellar vesicles: d=44.2Å, D=26.2Å, A=59.6Å2, and Nw=7.2, except of the A value 
[15].  The  increase  of  membrane  curvature  increases  the  bilayer  hydration  and  membrane 
thickness  [13].  The  area  per  one  DMPC  molecules  A  looks  as  constant  parameter  for 
unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles, that reflects the permanent intermolecular interaction in 
the  lateral  directions.  Probably,  membrane  hydration  decreases  during  the  aggregation  of  the 
unilamellar vesicles to the multilamellar and Nw=7.2 corresponds to the hydrated multilamellar 
vesicular system that is in the thermodynamic equilibrium with bulk water.

The developed  methods of the  membrane structure analyses  for one component  membrane 
were applied to study the mixed binary and quaternary systems. The SANS experiment for the 
investigation of MSC  membrane structure was carried out at the Budapest Neutron Scattering 
Center. The SANS spectrum obtained for vesicles composed of binary DMPC/Ceramide 3 and 
quaternary Ceramide 6/Cholesterol/Palmitic acid/Cholesterol Sulfate are presented at Fig. 4 and 
Fig. 5, respectively. The composition of binary DMPC/Ceramide 3 mixture corresponds to the 
ratio 6/1 in mole. Component ratio of Ceramide 6/Cholesterol/Palmitic acid/Cholesterol Sulfate 
is 55/20/15/10 (w/w). 

The  incoherent  background  was    fixed    IB=0.0109  cm-1  for  the  case  of  binary 
DMPC/ceramide 3 vesicles; and IB was a free parameter for the case of quaternary Ceramide 
6/Cholesterol/Palmitic  acid/Cholesterol  Sulfate  vesicles.  Obtained  results  are  summarized  in 
Table 2.

We  observe  experimentally  optical  bistability  enhanced 

through  Fano 

interferences in high-Q localized silicon photonic crystal resonances (Q ~ 30,000 

and  modal  volume  ~  0.98  cubic  wavelengths).  This  phenomenon  is  analyzed 

through nonlinear coupled-mode formalism, including the interplay of χ(3) effects 

such as two-photon absorption and related free-carrier dynamics, and optical Kerr 

as  well  as  thermal  effects  and  linear  losses.  Our  experimental  and  theoretical 

results  demonstrate  for  the  first  time  Fano-resonance  based  bistable  states  with 

switching thresholds of 185 µW and 4.5 fJ internally stored cavity energy (~ 540 

fJ consumed energy) in silicon for scalable optical buffering and logic.

Two-dimensional  photonic  crystal  (2D  PhC)  slabs  confine  light  by  Bragg  reflection 

in-plane and total internal reflection in the third dimension. Introduction of point and line 

defects  into  2D  PhC  slabs  create  localized  resonant  cavities  and  PhC  waveguides 

respectively, with ab initio arbitrary dispersion control. Such defect cavities in high-index 

contrast materials possess strong confinement with subwavelength modal volumes (Vm) at 
~  (λ/n)3,  corresponding  to  high  field  intensities  per  photon  for  increased  nonlinear 

interaction. Moreover, cavities with remarkable high quality factors (Q) [1, 2] have been 

achieved recently, now permitting nanosecond photon lifetimes for enhanced light-matter 

interactions.  The  strong  localization  and  long  photon  lifetimes  in  these  high-Q/Vm 

photonic  crystal  nanocavities  point  to  enhanced  nonlinear  optical  physics,  such  as 

Lorentzian-cavity-based bistability [3-6] and Raman lasing [7, 8] in silicon photonics.  

The interference of a discrete energy state with a continuum can give rise to sharp and 

asymmetric  lineshapes,  referred  to  Fano  resonances  [9,  10].  Compared  to  a  Lorentzian 

resonance, these lineshapes arise from temporal pathways that involve direct and indirect 

(for  example  a  resonance)  transmission,  with  a  reduced  frequency  shift  required  for 

nonlinear  switching  due  to  its  sharper  lineshape.  If  the  indirect  pathway  can  be  further 

strongly localized (such as in a high-Q/Vm 3D cavity instead of a 1D Fabry-Perot cavity), 

the  nonlinear  characteristic  switching  thresholds  can  be  further  reduced.  Optical 

bistability involving Fano resonances due to Kerr effect in photonic crystal cavities has 

been  theoretically  studied  based  on  Green’s  function  solution  of  Maxwell’s  equations 

[11]. Fano resonances have also been studied by transfer matrix technique [10, 12], and 

coupled-mode equations [13]. 

In this Letter, we present our measurements on Fano-based optical bistability as well 

as  a  temporal  nonlinear  coupled-mode  framework  for  numerical  analysis.  Figure  1(a) 

shows  a  schematic  of  the  theoretical  model.  A  waveguide  with  two  partially  reflecting 

elements is side-coupled to a cavity.  a is the amplitude of the cavity mode and s is the 

amplitude  of  the  waveguide  mode.  With  the  coupled-mode  formalism  [14,  15],  the 

dynamic equation for the amplitude a(t) of the resonance mode is [13, 16]

 [3,5,7]. The  ω∆  detuning of the cavity resonance from 

0ω is  modeled  due  to  the  Kerr  effect,  free-carrier  dispersion  (FCD),  and  thermal 

dispersion effects under first-order perturbation. With the modeled carrier dynamics and 

thermal  transients  [7],  the  coupled  nonlinear  dynamical  behavior  of  the  Fano  optical 

system is numerically integrated. 

The optical system consisting of a photonic crystal waveguide side coupled to a high-

Q/Vm  nanocavity  with  five  linearly  aligned  missing  air  holes  (L5)  in  an  air-bridge 

triangular lattice photonic crystal slab with thickness of 0.6a and the radius of air holes is 

0.29a, where the lattice period a = 420 nm, as shown in Figure 1(b). The shift S1 of two 

air-holes at cavity edge is 0.02a to tune the radiation mode pattern for increasing the Q 

factors. The waveguide-to-cavity separation is five layers of holes. The index contrast at 

the waveguide input and output facets act as partially reflecting elements with distance L 

of  around  1.9  mm  to  form  a  Fabry-Perot  resonator  and  perturb  the  phase  of  waveguide 

mode.  Figure  1(c)  shows  the  Ey  field  of  the  resonance  mode  mid-slab  from  3D  FDTD 

simulations.  

The  devices  were  fabricated  with  the  standard  integrated  circuit  techniques  in  a 

silicon-on-insulator  substrate.  A  polarization  controller  and  a  lensed  fiber  are  used  to 

couple transverse-electric polarization light from tunable laser source into the waveguide. 

A second lensed fiber collects the transmission from the waveguide output that is sent to 

the  photodetector  and  lock-in  amplifier.  The  input  power  coupled  to  the  waveguide  is 

estimated from the transmitted power through the input lensed fiber, waveguide and the 

output lensed fiber [5]. The total transmission loss of the whole system is around 24.8 dB 

at  wavelength  of  1555  nm.  At  low  input  power  of  20  µW,  the  measured  resonant 

 

3

wavelength  λ0  is  1556.805  nm.  And  the  estimated  Q,  based  on  the  full-width  at  half 

maximum (FWHM) ∆λ of 52 pm is around 30,000. From 3D FDTD method, the vertical 

Q factor Qv is around 100,000 and the in-plane Q factor Qin is around 45,000 so that the 

total Q factor Qtot = 1/(1/Qv+1/Qin) = ~ 31,000. 

Figure  2(a)  shows  the  measured  transmission  spectrum  of  the  waveguide  with 

different input powers. Each transmission shown is repeated over multiple scans. Sharp 

and  asymmetric  Fano  lineshapes  are  observed.  The  spectral  lineshapes  depend  on  the 

position of cavity resonance in a Fabry-Perot background, highlighting Fano interference 

pathways.  Here  the  spectra  show  ascending  Fano  resonances.  The  Fabry-Perot  fringe 

spacing dλ is around 230 pm, which corresponds to the distance between two waveguide 
facets  d  =  1.902  mm  (d  =  λ2/(2*dλ*neff)  and  effective  index  of  2.77  from  FDTD 

simulations). As the input power increases, the Fano lineshapes were red-shifted due to 

two-photon-absorption  induced  thermo-optic  nonlinearities  in  silicon  [3-5].  Figure  2(b) 

shows the calculated transmission spectrum from nonlinear coupled-mode model with the 

input powers used in the experiment. All parameters used in calculation are from either 

reference papers or FDTD results [7]. When the input power is 1 µW or less, the cavity 

response is in the linear regime. As the input power increases, the Fano lineshapes were 

red-shifted. 

Figure 3(a) shows the observed hysteresis loop of Fano resonance at red detuning δ of 

22 pm. The bistable loops of ascending Fano lineshapes are very distinct from Lorentzian 

lineshapes.  Firstly,  one  suggestive  indication  is  the  asymmetry  in  the  hysteresis  loop, 

with  sharp  increase  (gentle  decrease)  with  increasing  (decreasing)  power  for  lower 

(upper)  branch,  resulting  from  the  asymmetric  Fano  lineshape.  Secondly,  for  ascending 

Fano resonances, an important indication is the upward slope (increase in transmission) 

for  increasing  input  power  for  a  side-coupled  cavity.  For  a  symmetric  Lorentzian  in  a 

side-coupled  drop  cavity,  a  downward  slope  (or  decrease  in  transmission)  should  be 

expected for increasing input power [17]. Thirdly, the dip in the transmission (as indicted 

by the dotted red circle in Figure 3(a)) is another signature of the Fano resonance. This 

feature is not observable with a symmetric Lorentzian and in fact is an aggregate result of 

the three self-consistent solutions of the nonlinear Fano system, such as predicted using 

Green’s  function  method  in  Ref.  11.  Our  nonlinear  coupled-mode  theory  framework 

 

4

cannot trace out the individual solutions [11] but show the aggregate behavior, and is in 

remarkable  agreement  with  our  experimental  measurements  and  the  Green’s  function 

predictions. 

The Fano bistable “off” power (poff) is estimated at 147 µW and the “on” power (pon) 

at  189  µW  for  a  22  pm  detuning,  as  shown  in  Figure  3(a).  These  threshold  powers  are 

determined experimentally from half the total system transmission losses. From the 189 

µW  (147  µW)  pon  (poff)  thresholds,  this  corresponds  to  an  estimated  internally  stored 

cavity energy [3] of 4.5 fJ (1.5 fJ) based on a numerical estimate of waveguide-to-cavity 

coupling coefficient (κ2) of 13.3 GHz. The consumed energy, in terms of definition used 

in Ref. 18, is ~ 540 fJ (60 fJ) based on the numerical estimated thermal relaxation time of 

25 ns and 11.4 % (1.6 %) of input power absorbed by TPA process for “on” (“off”) state, 

although  this  could  be  much  lower  with  minimum  detuning  to  observe  bistability.  The 

femto-joule  level  switching  in  the  stored  cavity  energy  is  due  to  the  lowered  threshold 

from the sharp Fano interference lineshape, the small mode volume and high-Q photonic 

crystal cavities. For the 22 pm detuning, the switching intensity contrast ratio is estimated 

at 3.5 dB (from the regions with sharp discrete bistable “jumps”) with a pon/poff ratio of 

1.286. Figure 3(b) shows the calculated Fano bistable hysteresis at the detuning of 22 pm 

from nonlinear coupled-mode theory. The calculated poff and pon thresholds are 151 µW 

(with  the  stored  cavity  energy  of  1.5  fJ)  and  186  µW  (4.5  fJ)  respectively,  in  excellent 

agreement with the experimental results, with a switching contrast of 9.3 dB and pon/poff 

ratio of 1.232.  

Now we examine parametrically the dependence of the Fano-type bistability against 

achievable  device  characteristics,  with  our  developed  nonlinear  model.  Figure  4 

summarizes  the  extensive  numerically-calculated  effects  of  normalized-detuning  (δ/∆λ), 

mirror reflectivity r, cavity Q, and the position of cavity resonance on the characteristic 

threshold power pon, and switching contrast. A baseline Q of 31,000, a r of 0.5 with 11% 

mirror  loss,  a  λ0  of  1556.805  nm,  and  a  detuning  of  δ=∆λ  is  used.  In  Figure  4(a),  the 

threshold  power  for  the  Fano  bistability  increases  for  increasing  normalized  detuning 

(further  normalized  shift  of  incident  laser  frequency  from  Fano  resonance)  due  to  the 

larger shift in resonance needed for bistable switching. The switching contrast decreases 

slightly with increasing detuning due to the reduced contrast in the transmission (see for 

 

5

example  Figure  2  on  the  slight  reduction  in  “peaks”and  “dips”  contrast  for  increasing 

input power) at the higher input powers needed for the bistable operation. The red-filled 

symbols correspond to the current experimental parameters. This switching contrast can 

significantly  increase  when  the  mirror  reflectivity  r  increases  from  0.35  to  0.8  (at 

detuning  of  δ=∆λ)  at  the  expense  of  increasing  pon  (Figure  4(b)).  The  increase  in  pon  is 

due to higher mirror reflectivity, resulting in lower power coupled into the Fano system. 

A  limit  of  0.35  is  used  because  for  smaller  r,  a  combination  of  both  Lorentzian  and 

ascending Fano resonance starts to appear. For r greater than 0.8, the threshold power is 

high, approximately a few milli-watts. 

Figure  4(c)  plots  the  threshold  power  and  the  stored  cavity  energy  with  different 
cavity  Q  factors  at  detuning  of  δ=∆λ  and  r=0.5.  Note  that  pon  shows  a  (1/Q1.568)-
dependence,  while  the  stored  cavity  energy  needed  for  bistable  shows  a  (1/Q0.674)-

dependence,  highlighting  the  difference  with  a  Lorentzian-type  bistability  where  a 
1/Q1.615  and  1/Q0.678-dependence  is  found  respectively  by  setting  r=0  in  the  numerical 

simulations. The smaller exponential in the Fano system depicts a smaller improvement 

in  threshold  and  cavity  energy  with  increasing  Q,  or  a  less  stringent  requirement  for 

higher  cavity  Q  in  Fano-type  systems  in  contrast  to  Lorentzian-type  systems.  We  also 

note  that  direct  comparisons  between  an  ascending  Fano-type  bistability  and  a 

Lorentzian-type  bistability  are  difficult  because  the  Fano  system  depends  on  multiple 

parameters;  at  specific  parameters,  it  performs  better  (such  as  with  pon  or  switching 

contrast as possible parameters) and at other parameters, vice versa. For cavity Q factor 

of  1  million,  the  Fano  threshold  power  is  estimated  at  2  µW,  which  corresponds  to  the 

stored  cavity  energy  of  0.53  fJ.  This  stored  cavity  energy  is  much  lower  than  a  Fano 

resonance with cavity Q of 31,000 (4.5 fJ). 

Figure 4(d) illustrates the influence of different position of cavity resonance λ  relative 

to experimental λ0 within the half period of Fabry-Perot background dλ/2 with Q=31,000, 

r=0.5, and δ=∆λ, where the limits of (λ-λ0)/(dλ/2) are from -0.9 to 0.1 for ascending Fano 

resonances. These limits are chosen because they cover the region where the ascending 

Fano  resonances  are  dominant  over  the  Lorentzian  or  the  descending  Fano  resonances. 

For  ascending  Fano  resonances,  pon  decreases  as  the  cavity  resonance  λ  shifts  from  the 

Fabry-Perot background maximum to its minimum. However, the switching contrast has 

 

6

a  maximum  at  a  region  between  the  maximum  and  minimum  Fabry-Perot  background, 

illustrating an interesting trade-off when selecting an optimum set of Fano-type bistable 

operating parameters. 

In  this  work  we  demonstrate  experimentally  for  the  first  time  all-optical  bistability 

arising  from  sharp  Fano  resonances  in  high-Q/Vm  silicon  photonic  crystal  nanocavities. 

Using  the  two-photon-absorption  induced  thermo-optic  nonlinearity,  an  “on”-state 

threshold  of  189  µW  and  stored  cavity  energy  of  4.5  fJ  is  observed,  and  in  good 

agreement  with  the  nonlinear  coupled-mode  formalism.  Although  the  thermo-optic  is 

slow  (on  order  of  µs),  other  nonlinear  mechanisms  such  as  two-photon-absorption 

induced  free-carrier  dispersion  [3,4,6]  can  remarkably  achieve  ~  50  ps  switching  in 

silicon. The threshold power can be further reduced to the µW level (or sub-fJ of stored 

cavity energy) with higher-Q/Vm nanocavities or further optimization of the detuning for 

reduced threshold and large contrast ratio. Our first observations of Fano-type bistability 

highlight the feasibility of an ultra-low energy switching mechanism in monolithic silicon 

benefiting from the sharp Fano lineshapes, for scalable functionalities such as all-optical 

switching, memory, and logic for information processing.

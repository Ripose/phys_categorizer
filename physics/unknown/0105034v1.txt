In a recent Letter, "Negative Refraction Makes a Perfect Lens" (PRL, 2000, v.

85(18), pp. 3966 - 3969), author J. B. Pendry makes several puzzling claims.

First, the author begins by stating that "[lens] limitations are dictated by wave

optics:  no lens can focus light onto an area smaller than a square wavelength."

This is not strictly true.  The imaging limitations are given by Heisenberg's

Uncertainty Principle, not wave optics.  In the one-dimensional form, this limitation

states that  4pD

, which implies that

.  So, for frequency in Hz,

and momentum per c, the smallest resolved detail  D x  either in the object or in an

image of it would be given by,

D x ‡ l p2 ,                                                                                                  (1)

within some factor of what one considered an identifiable  l.    A limit of  l 4  would

be optimistic.   The focussing mechanism is irrelevant to this limit; it can be

overcome only by taking advantage of predictability in repeated measurements.

Phase correction, for example in semiconductor fabrication, uses small, thin-film

shapes to take advantage of predictability and requires that the desired geometry of

each image be known before imaging.   The optical system in the near field then

may be designed so that the actual image is a corrected, "perfect" copy of an object

up to, but not beyond, the Heisenberg equality in (1).

There is another, different limitation on the resolution of an optical system,

namely the size of the entrance pupil.  The aperture holding a lens or silver film

would determine this size.  A small aperture loses those low Fourier spatial

frequencies which transform to supply the highest image detail.

Second, the author states just after Eq. (9) that, when both the permittivity  e

and the permeability  m  are negative, one must use the negative square root in

n = em .   However, algebraically, 

n 2 =

em

(

m :  The negation operator for

vectors is distributive, for example in

, so it appears that one would

choose the solution of  n 2 = em  depending on the direction of propagation.   If only one

of  e  and  m  were negative, the refractive index would be imaginary, not negative.

The evanescent fields, of course, are signed to define the same direction of

propagation as the field in the imaging medium; continuity in Maxwell's equations

requires this and allows no freedom of choice or control.

Pendry's approach does not seem to consider a complex n, nor a complex

permittivity nor permeability.   The question of a complex index of refraction

inconsistency among authors, as lamented in [1].   It therefore would seem unwise of

Pendry to prescribe a negative sign in a field expression without consideration of

context.   However, the sine being a simple odd function, adopting a negative sign

represent a negative refractive index in lens design, for example in correction of

Although it might seem odd to have a convex lens acting concave, there doesn't seem

to be anything impossible about a negative n in the context of Snell's law:  The sign

simply might be moved by the designer to the sine argument, as when accounting

for reflections.

Third, the author makes several statements about the evanescent field, but seems

not to distinguish between it and the field of a plane wave.   Indeed, if the

evanescent field at the border of an aperture could be used to increase the aperture

size indefinitely, the resolution might be made to approach the limit  D x  in (1) above.

But, for the energy in the evanescent field to improve the image, the entrance pupil

diameter would have to be comparable in linear size to the evanescent field, which

would be, say, one wavelength.  A wavelength-sized system actually seems to be the

system for which Pendry's calculations were made.   A system with wavelength-

sized aperture would experience significant diffractive losses and hardly could

image anything, whether amplified or not.   Adding evanescent terms to improve an

already poor image merely would represent the effect of increasing aperture size at

most by a few more wavelengths and could not be expected to approach the equality

in (1) above.

Finally, the author states on p. 3967 that "evanescent waves transport no

energy".   Perhaps better would be to say that they dissipate no energy; they do no

work on the medium.   However, like all other regions of the field of a propagating

electromagnetic wave, the evanescent fields store energy transiently and return it to

the rest of the field according to the propagation geometry and the time-course of

any associated causality.  Coupling of energy by evanescent fields may be

demonstrated simply by holding two optic fibers in differentially close contact with

one another.

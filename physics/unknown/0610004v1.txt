The radiation forces on a Rayleigh dielectric sphere induced by a partially coherent light beam are 

greatly  affected  by  the  coherence  of  the  light  beam.  The  magnitude  of  the  radiation  forces  on  a 

dielectric  sphere  near  the  focus  point  greatly  decreases  as  the  coherence  decreases.  For  the  light 

beam with good coherence, the radiation force may be used to trap a particle; and for the light beam 

with intermediate coherence, the radiation force may be used to guide and accelerate a particle. ©

Optical  trapping  and  manipulation  of  micron-sized  particles  have  been  extensively  attended  (see 

some reviews [1-4]) since the seminal work of Ashkin [5] on radiation pressure. This technology has 

been a powerful tool, in particular, in biophysical sciences for trapping living cells and organelles [6-7], 

DNA analysis [8], and atomic physics for manipulating the neutral atoms [9-10].

In 1970, Ashkin [5] first demonstrated that micron-sized particles can be accelerated and trapped 

by  the  radiation  forces  from  two  counter-propagating  laser  beams.  In  1986,  Ashkin  et  al.  further 

showed  that  even  a  single  laser  beam  focused  into  the  dielectric  sphere  can  pull  up  and  trap  this 

dielectric sphere at the focus point [11]. The trap induced by a single beam is termed as a single-beam 

gradient  force  trap.  Up  to  now,  there  are  a  series  of  investigation  on  the  trapping  characteristics  of 

various  of  single-beam  gradient  force  traps  induced  by  different  kinds  of  beams  [5,11-18],  such  as 

Gaussian  [5,  11],  bottle  [13],  zero-order  Bessel  [15],  and  self-focused  laser  beams  [16],  and  even 

evanescent fields [17-18]. In all these previous studies attention was paid on the fully coherent light, 

which can be highly focused or enhanced by different instruments such as the lens with high numerical 

aperture  [5,11-12]  and  a  sharply  pointed  metal  tip  [19].  However,  in  practice,  any  laser  fields  are 

always partially coherent [20]. It is well known that the focusing characteristics of partially coherent 

light beams are greatly affected by their coherence [21-23]. Therefore, it can be expected that radiation 

forces induced by partially coherent light beams will also depends on their coherence.  

In this Letter we consider the effect of coherence of a highly focused Gaussian-Schell model (GSM) 

beam on the radiation force acting on a Rayleigh dielectric sphere. The profiles of the intensity and the 

degree  of  spatial  coherence  of  the  beam  are  Gaussian  [20].  Many  authors  have  pointed  out  that  the 

intensity distributions and focusing characteristics for a GSM beam near the focus of a lens are greatly 

affected  by  its  coherence  [21,  24-25].  We  ask  ourselves  what  is  the  influence  of  the  coherence  of  a 

GSM beam on the radiation force. 

For  simplicity,  we  consider  a  two-dimensional  (2D)  GSM  beam  (with  the  wavelength 

0λ  in 

vacuum)  focused  by  a  thin  lens  with  the  focus  length  f ,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1.  From  the  theory  of 

coherence,  the  cross-spectral  density  of  the  incident  GSM  beam  at  the  input  plane  (z=0)  can  be 

assumed to be [20]:

the same intensity profiles in the plane of 

0=z

 (i.e., at the lens plane), the output intensity distribution 

after the lens will be greatly affected by the correlation width 

0σ (i.e., its coherence).  

 

It  is  well  known  that  light  has  the  momentum,  and  the  radiation  force  comes  from  the 

momentum  transfer  between  photons  and  particles.  There  are  two  types  of  radiation  forces:  the 

scattering and gradient forces [4, 11]. For single-beam gradient traps both two forces will be configured 

to give a point of stable equilibrium located close to the beam focus [11], which can be used to trap a 

particle. In this paper, we assume the diameter  a2  of a dielectric particle (with refractive index 

pn ) be 

much  smaller  than 

0λ ,    so  that  the  scattering  and  gradient  forces  can  be  expressed,  respectively,  as

Obviously, for the 2D light beam, the gradient force consists of two components that act as restoring 

forces directed towards the real focusing center of the beam for the particle with 

1>m

. From Eqs. (3), 

(4a-b), both the scattering and gradient forces will be greatly affected by the coherence of the beam.  

In  the  following  calculations,  we  take  the  parameters  as  that  in  Ref.  [26]:

0 =w

assumed  to  be

200

mW/

µ

.  The  focusing  length  of  the  lens  is 

2=f

cm.  Figure  2  shows  the 

2

typical effect of the coherence on both the scattering and gradient forces acting on the Rayleigh particle 

with radius 

10=a

nm. From Fig. 2 (a), (b) and (c), for the fully coherent beams, the magnitude of the 

radiation forces on the dielectric particles are the strongest (e. g., see the solid curves for  

5w=σ
0

0

), in 

this case, the radiation force may be used as optical trapping and manipulate the particle with 

1>m

. 

The magnitude of the radiation forces decrease quickly with 

0σ  becoming smaller [see the red dashed 

curves for 

=σ

, the blue dash-dotted curves for 

=σ

, and the green short-dashed curves 

for

 in Fig. 2 (a-c)]. Figure 2(d) shows that there is a stable equilibrium near the focusing 

point  for  the  case  of 

5w=σ
0

0

.  With  the  decreasing  of 

0σ ,  the  stable  equilibrium  region  of  the 

radiation  force  near  the  focusing  point  gradually  disappears  [see  the  curve  in  (e) 

0 w=σ

 of  Fig.  2].  In  Fig.  2(g),  the  scattering  force  is  dominated  in  the  z 

direction so that the particle may be accelerated along the beam propagation. Therefore, one can control 

the radiation forces by adjusting the light coherence of the incident beams with the same intensities. 

In  practice,  the  particle  in  the  surrounding  medium  (such  as  in  water)  always  suffers  the 

Brownian motion due to the thermal fluctuations. From the fluctuation-dissipation theorem of Einstein, 

the  magnitude  of  the  Brownian  force 

 is  given  by  [17]

radiation force and the Brownian force. From Eq. (2), we can readily find the real focusing point

. The necessary criterion for 

axial stability of a single-beam trap is that  R , the ratio of the backward gradient force to the forward-

.  Obviously,  this  condition  is  also  dependent  on 

0σ .  By  comparing 

 5

 

 

the  radiation  forces  at  these  critical  points  (A,  B,  C  and  D)  with  the  Brownian  force,  one  can  judge 

whether the particle can be trapped or not.  

Figure 3 shows the dependence of the maximum transverse and longitudinal gradient forces on 

0σ  with different radius  a . For the comparison, we also plot the Brownian force at temperature 

Co30

 

and the scattering force at the position where the longitudinal gradient force on the z axis reaches its 

maximum.  Both  the  maximum  transverse  and  longitudinal  gradient  forces  decrease  as  the  coherence 

decreases [see the solid and dashed curves in Fig. 3 (a)-(d)], and the scattering force is also decreasing 

with the reduction of 

0σ  [see the dot-dashed curves in Fig. 3 (a)-(d)]. For the different-size particles, 

the magnitude of the Brownian force is proportional to 

 [see the dotted lines in Fig. 3(a)-(d)]. When 

2/1a

the particle is very small [see Fig. 3(a)], for the beams with the large value of 

0σ  (good coherence), the 

radiation forces are dominated by  

 [see the right side of the vertical line  P  in Fig. 

r
GradF

,

x

 and 

r
GradF

,

z

3(a)],  so  the  radiation  forces  can  stably  trap  and  manipulate  the  small  particle  in  this  case.  For  the 

beams  with  the  intermediate  value  of 

0σ  between  the  vertical  lines  P  and  Q  in  Fig.  3(a)  (where 

r

),  if 

 can  also  overcome 

 [also  see  Fig.  3(b)],  the  particle  will  be 

r

guided and accelerated along the beam propagation, conversely, the particle will escape away from the 

beam trapping even if it can be confined in the transverse direction due to the transverse gradient force. 

For the beams with low coherence [see the left side of the line  Q  in Fig. (a)-(d)], the radiation force 

cannot be used to trap or accelerate any kind of particles due to the effect of the Brownian motion. For 

the large particles (in the Rayleigh approximation), 

 will be larger than 

, see Fig. 3(c) and 

r
ScatF

,

z

(d), in this case, the radiation force produced by the beam with good coherence can be easily used to 

accelerate the particle along the beam propagation. 

 

In  conclusion,  we  have  investigated  the  radiation  forces  on  the  Rayleigh  dielectric  particle 

produced by the partially coherent light beam. It is shown that the radiation forces are greatly affected 

by the coherence of the light. As the coherence decreases, the magnitude of the radiation forces on a 

dielectric sphere near the focus point greatly decreases. Our calculations make clear that whether the 

 6

light beam can be used to trap the particle is greatly affected by the beam coherence. For the light beam 

with  good  coherence,  the  radiation  force  may  be  used  to  trap  a  particle;  for  the  light  beam  with 

intermediate  coherence,  the  radiation  force  could  be  used  to  guide  a  particle  along  the  beam 

propagation, while for the low-coherent light beam, it is very difficult to manipulate a particle.

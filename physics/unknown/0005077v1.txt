the  special 

theory 

that  fundamentally  distinguishes 

The relativity of simultaneity is central to the special theory, and it is the
basis  for  the  other  results  of  the  special  theory.    It  is  the  relativity  of
simultaneity 
from
Newtonian mechanics and the kinematics underlying it.  What generally is not
appreciated is that Einstein's  argument on the relativity of simultaneity itself is
the  first  result  and  that  the  argument  itself  is  reflected  in  the  structure  and
functioning  of  the  physical  world.    The  arbitrary  nature  of  the  decision
regarding the particular inertial reference frame from which Einstein's  argument
on the relativity of simultaneity begins is discussed,  and it is this arbitrary, or
freely made, decision that is the basis for the significance of the argument of the
relativity of simultaneity itself on the structure and functioning of the  physical
world.  Moreover, the arbitrary choice as to the direction in which the relativity
of simultaneity is argued indicates that there is a specific cognitive effect on the
functioning of the physical world because the particular format of the argument
on the relativity of simultaneity used is freely chosen without physical or mental
constraints, as none are indicated in the special theory.

The  paper  approaches  the  role  of  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  in  the
special theory through a gedankenexperiment known as the twin paradox and,
more  generally,  in  terms  of  the  relation  between  temporal  durations  of  an
occurrence  and  the  spatial  lengths  of  physical  existents  in  inertial  reference
frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another.    The  argument
concerning  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  leads  to  an  interesting  conundrum
regarding light, a conundrum that serves to make more explicit the importance
of the argument on the relativity of simultaneity to the structure and functioning
of  the  physical  world  in  the  special  theory.    The  general  lack  of  two-way
empirical tests in the special theory (i.e., tests in which each of the two inertial
reference frames is considered  the  "stationary"  reference  frame,  the  reference
frame  in  which  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  begins,  in  a
scenario) is discussed.  Two examples of other kinds of tests which have been
conducted are discussed and contrasted with a proposed two-way test.

The Twin Paradox

A gedankenexperiment known as the twin paradox  has  attracted  much
attention since Einstein proposed the special theory of relativity.  Essentially, in
the  twin  paradox  one  of  a  pair  of  twins,  who  are  both  originally  on  earth,
travels in a spaceship away from the earth with constant velocity in a rectilinear
manner  and  without  rotation.    After  traveling  away  from  the  earth,  the
spaceship makes an abrupt 180o turn and returns to earth.  The question asked
in the paradox is: Which twin is younger and which is older upon the return of
the spaceship to earth?  According to a popular phrase conveying a fundamental
result of the special theory of relativity, moving clocks run slower.    Thus,  as
each of the twins considers for the most part himself or herself at rest and his or
her sibling moving in a uniform, rectilinear manner relative to him or her,  each
sibling would apparently expect to find the other sibling younger than he or she
when the spaceship returns  to  earth.    The  "moving"  sibling  finds  himself  or
herself aging in accordance  with  the  time  measured  by  the  "moving"  clocks,
and  thus  this  sibling  would  age  slower.    In  fact,  according  to  Feynman,
Leighton, and Sands, the biological aging processes in the "moving" sibling or
the  "stationary"  sibling  themselves  could  be  considered  clocks  at  rest  in  the
respective inertial reference frames in which each of the siblings is at rest.

The underlying principle in this apparent paradox is that for two inertial
reference frames in uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another,  it  is
arbitrary in the special theory which inertial frame is considered the "stationary"
frame  and  which  the  "moving"  frame  for  deducing  the  Lorentz  coordinate
transformation equations for these  inertial  reference  frames.    (As  the  Lorentz
coordinate  transformation  equations  are  dependent  on 
the  relativity  of
simultaneity,  as  will  be  shown,  "stationary"  essentially  refers  to  the  inertial
reference  frame  where  the  argument  concerning  the  relativity  of  simultaneity
begins, where simultaneity is first established and time delineated for an inertial
reference  frame.    "Moving"  essentially  refers  to  the  other  inertial  reference
frame  where  the  time  of  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  is  introduced  to
determine whether the criterion of simultaneity in the "moving" frame is met.)
As noted, in the special theory, the Lorentz coordinate transformation equations
depend  fundamentally  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  for  inertial  reference
frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another.    And  the
relativity  of  simultaneity  for  these  inertial  reference  frames  depends  on  two
major factors: 1) the use of the invariant and finite velocity of light in all inertial
reference  frames  in  the  development  of  simultaneity  and  time  in  an  inertial

- 2 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

reference frame; and 2) the principle of relativity that the laws of physics are the
same in all inertial reference frames.  Both factors prevent an observer at rest in
one of two inertial reference frames moving in a uniform translational  manner
relative to each other from having a privileged view concerning the functioning
of  the  physical  world.    Neither  observer  can  rely  on  the  motion  of  light  to
determine which inertial frame is actually moving and which  stationary.    And
neither observer can rely on  the  relative  velocity  of  the  two  inertial  reference
frames to help in this determination.

As  concerns  the  twin  paradox,  the  attempted  resolution  most  widely
held depends on the point that only the twin  in  the  spaceship  experiences  the
acceleration resulting from the spaceship turning around in order to place it on a
course toward earth.  Thus, there would appear to be some "objective" basis for
determining that the twin on the spaceship was really moving.(1)  As Feynman,
Leighton, and Sands wrote concerning the twin paradox:

So the way to state the rule is to say that the man who has felt
the accelerations, who has seen things fall against the walls,  and
so  on,  is  the  one  who  would  be  the  younger;  that  is  the
difference  between  them  in  an  "absolute"  sense,  and  it  is
certainly correct.(2)

Various other explanations have been suggested over the  years  from  both  the
special theory as well as the general theory of relativity to resolve the paradox.1

2.

A Different Gedankenexperiment

Whether  the  attempted  resolutions  in  fact  resolve  the  paradox,  the
concern  here  is  with  a  more  basic  scenario  than  the  twin  paradox:  it  is  the
circumstance where the spaceship continues to move away from the earth.   That
is, the scenario here is the spaceship does not turn around abruptly and return to
earth.    Essentially,  this  scenario  involves  two  inertial  reference  frames  that
continue  to  move  in  a  uniform  translational  manner  relative  to  one  another.
With regard to this circumstance, one cannot, for example, attempt  to  rely  on
the  acceleration  of  one  of  the  frames  (i.e.,  the  one  "really"  moving)  to
distinguish  the  two  reference  frames  and  thus  to  decide  which  clock  in  its
respective inertial reference frame runs slower.

In the scenario of concern  in  this  paper,  what  is  the  relation  between
temporal durations measured by the twins if they keep moving away from one
another in a uniform translational manner?  Is the twin on earth aging slower, or
is the twin on the spaceship aging slower?  It might seem that such  questions

- 3 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

are like the position of the critic in Feynman, Leighton, and Sands'  discussion
of the twin paradox.  They wrote:

[The twin paradox] is called a "paradox" only by the people who
believe  that  the  [special]  principle  of  relativity  means  that  all
motion is relative;  they say,  "Heh,  heh,  heh from the point  of
view of Paul [the twin on the spaceship], can't we say that Peter
was moving and should  therefore  appear  to  age  more  slowly?
By symmetry, the only possible result is that both should be the
same age when they meet."(3)

In the scenario where the twin in the spaceship does not turn around and return
to earth, there is only uniform, translational motion.  In the special theory, this
kind of motion is clearly relative.  It will be shown  that the answer as to which
inertial  reference  frame's  clocks  run  "slower"  and  which  "faster"  depends
fundamentally  on  the  relationship  between  the  inertial  reference  frames  in
uniform translational motion in the argument on the relativity of simultaneity in
the  special  theory.    The  logical  relationship  is  the  key  because  whatever  the
particular  relationship  between  the  time  measured  by  clocks  at  rest  in  their
respective inertial reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to
one another is depends on the relativity of simultaneity.

inertial  reference  frame  (B)  depends  on 

More specifically, the designation of  one  of  the  clocks  as  at  rest  in  a
"stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  (A)  and  the  other  clock  at  rest  in  a
"moving" 
the  corresponding
designations  of  A  as  "stationary"  in  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity and B as "moving" in  this  argument.    There  is  nothing  physical
indicated in the special theory that keeps the argument concerning the relativity
of simultaneity from being argued with  B  as  the  "stationary"  reference  frame
and A as the "moving" reference frame.    Indeed  the  relativity  of  simultaneity
can be argued in this manner and the theoretical integrity of the special  theory
depends on it.  If it were not possible to argue the relativity of simultaneity in
this  latter  fashion,  there  would  be  a  preferred  inertial  reference  frame,  a
violation of  the  fundamental  tenet  of  the  special  theory  that  inertial  reference
frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  are  equivalent
with regard to the description of physical phenomena.

These same points hold for the relation between  temporal  durations  in
inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another.
This last result should not be surprising  as  the  relationship  between  temporal
durations  depends  for  its  explanation  on  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of

- 4 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

simultaneity.  One implication of this dependence  is,  for  example,  that  in  the
case of the twins the notion of one twin aging slower or faster  than  the  other
occurs only in the context of its particular relationship with the other twin.   The
context of this relationship takes the form of a logical argument that begins with
the consideration of one of the inertial reference frames in which light, having a
finite and invariant velocity, is used to determine simultaneity in this reference
frame (called the "stationary" frame).  This same light, specifically its velocity,
is  then  juxtaposed  with  the  uniform  translational  velocity  of  the  inertial
reference  frames  relative  to  one  another  in  order  to  determine  whether  the
criterion  for  simultaneity  in  the  other  inertial  reference  frame  (called  the
"moving" frame) is met.  (Even though observers at rest in the "moving" frame
measure the invariant velocity for this light as do observers in the "stationary"
frame,  the  juxtaposition  of  the  invariant  velocity  of  light  in  the  "stationary"
frame  with  the  uniform  translational  velocity  of  the  inertial  reference  frames
relative to one another is at the center of the relativity of simultaneity.)2

As noted, one part of the answer as to which inertial frame's  clocks run
"slower" and which "faster" is theoretical in nature in that it involves the logical
structure of the argument demonstrating the relativity of simultaneity.  The other
part of the answer appears to be concrete in nature.  It depends on the fact that
an observer always considers himself at rest in his inertial reference frame and
considers his reference frame at rest as well.  Thus,  an observer in an  inertial
reference frame always sees himself in the "stationary"  inertial reference frame.
If he did not see himself as such, if he knew that he was moving,  the argument
concerning the relativity of simultaneity could not be argued with this observer
as the "stationary" observer.  We would then have absolute  motion, a violation
of the fundamental tenet of the special theory that for observers at rest in inertial
reference frames, uniform translational motion is relative.  Thus,  what  at  first
appears  a  concrete  indication  of  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  in  that  it  is
experienced is in part theoretical in nature.  It is in part theoretical because the
observer's  concrete experience of being at rest in  his  inertial  reference  frame,
and  seeing  his  frame  as  "stationary,"  while  obtaining  empirical  results
consistent  with  his  being  in  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  which  are  in
agreement with the special theory, depends for its explanation on the argument
demonstrating the relativity of simultaneity.

The relationship between temporal durations in inertial reference frames
in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  has  been  addressed
briefly.    A  similar  question  concerning  the  spatial  length  of  some  physical

- 5 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

existent  may  be  asked  as  well.    Specifically,  if  observers  at  rest  in  their
respective inertial reference frames each measure identically constructed rods at
rest in the other observers' inertial reference frame, each observer will measure
the rod in the other frame, the "moving" frame, to  be  shorter  than  the  rod  in
their own frame in which it is at rest.  Thus, who is really measuring the shorter
rod?  In the next two sections, these relationships are discussed in greater detail
and pictorially depicted.

Further Comments on Temporal Relations Between Inertial Reference
Frames

Figure 1 is a Minkowski diagram of  two  inertial  reference  frames,  W
and  W',  each  of  one  spatial  dimension,  moving  in  a  uniform  translational
manner relative to one another along their respective spatial axes and in which
the the description of the relative motion begins with  the  spatial  and  temporal
origins  of  W  and  W'  corresponding  to  one  another.    In  the  Minkowski
diagram, this correspondence of the spatial and temporal origins is represented
by the spatial and temporal origins  of  the  coordinate  schemes  for  W  and  W '
overlapping.  For inertial reference frame W, axis x and t are the space and time
axes respectively.  For inertial reference frame W',  x'  and t'  are the space and
time axes respectively.

The general expressions relating temporal durations in inertial reference

frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another are:

t' = D

t/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (1)

where  W'  is  considered  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  W  the
"moving" inertial reference frame, and:

t = D

t'/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (2)

t  =  t2  -  t1,  D

where  W  is  considered  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  W'  the
"moving"  inertial  reference  frame.      D
t'  =  t'2  -  t'1,  v  is  the
magnitude of  the  uniform  translational  velocity  of  W  and  W'  relative  to  one
another, and c is the invariant velocity of light in inertial reference frames.  As
will  be  shown  in  "Spatiotemporal  Relations  and  the  Lorentz  Transformation
Equations,"  equations  1  and  2  are  derived  from  the  Lorentz  coordinate
transformation equations.

First,  consider the scenario where an observer at rest  in  W'  considers
the time measured by a clock at rest in W.  With regard to W',  the clock at rest
in  W  is  moving  with  a uniform,  translational  velocity,  -v.   This  particular

relationship  of  temporal  durations  measured  by  observers  at  rest  in  their
respective inertial reference frames and who use clocks at rest in their respective
frames is given by equation 1.   In this scenario, W'  is the "stationary" inertial
reference frame and W is the "moving" inertial reference frame.

Let the axis t from t = 0 to t = 10 represent the position of a clock at rest
in W from t = 0 to t = 10 at the spatial origin of W,  x = 0.   In W',  the times
corresponding to t = 0 and t = 10 will be measured by different clocks that are
at rest in W'.  The clock at rest in W'  at x = 0,  t = 0 in W will be at x'  = 0 in
W'.   The clock at rest in W'  at x = 0,  t = 10 in W will be at  x'  =  -6  in  W'.
(Remember that in W' the clock at rest in W is moving with the same uniform,
translational velocity that W is moving relative to W'.)   In  order  to  determine
the duration in W' corresponding to a duration of 10 units in W,  one needs to
extend a line parallel to the spatial axis in W', namely x', and intersecting x = 0
and t = 10 in W, to see where it intersects with the time axis for W',  t'.   (This
line represents the temporal coordinate, t',  in W'  that corresponds to the point
x = 0 and t = 10 in W.  The intersection of this line, parallel to the x'  axis,  with
the axis t' yields the time coordinate in W' corresponding to t = 10 and x = 0 in
W.)  The t' axis is intersected at t' = 10/(1 - v2/c2)1/2.  As noted, the time and
space coordinates  of  the  origins  of  W  and  W'  overlap,  and  thus  t'  =  0  and
x'  = 0 in W'  corresponds to t = 0 and x =  0  in  W.    The  difference  between
t' = 10/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 and t' = 0,  namely D
t'  = 10/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 is the amount
of time in W'  corresponding to D
t = 10 units in W.   In Figure 1,  it is  readily
seen that the amount of time elapsed in W'  corresponding to the  elapse  of  10
units in W is over 10 units.

Consider the reverse circumstance as portrayed in Figure 2 and which is
a pictorial representation of equation 2.   Here an observer in W  considers  the
time measured by a clock at rest in W'.   With regard to W,  the clock at rest in
W' moves with a uniform translational velocity v (the sign is changed because
of  the  reversal  in  direction  of  the  velocity).    In  this  scenario,  W  is  the
"stationary" inertial reference frame and W'  is  the  "moving"  inertial  reference
frame.  In this case, let the axis t' from t' = 0 to t' = 10 represent the position of
a clock at rest in W' from t' = 0 to t' = 10 at the spatial origin of W', x' = 0.  In
W, the times corresponding to t' = 0 and t'  = 10 will be measured by different
clocks  that  are  at  rest  in  W.    In  order  to  determine  the  duration  in  W
corresponding  to  a  duration  of  10  units  in  W',  one  needs  to  extend  a  line
parallel to the spatial axis in W, namely x, and intersecting x' = 0 and t' = 10 in
W', to see where  it intersects with the  time axis for W, t.  (This line represents

x' = 0 and t' = 10 in W'. The intersection of this line parallel to x with the axis t
yields the time coordinate in W corresponding to t'  =  10  and  x'  =  0  in  W'.)
The t axis is intersected at t = 10/(1 - v2/c2)1/2.  As noted, the time and space
coordinates  of  the  origins  of  W  and  W'  overlap,  and  thus  t  =  0  in  W
corresponds  to  t'  =  0  and  x'  =  0  in  W'. 
  The  difference  between

t = 10/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 is the amount of
time in W corresponding to D
t' = 10 units in W'.  In Figure 2, it is readily seen
that the amount of time elapsed in W corresponding to the elapse of 10 units in
W' is over 10 units.

The  two  circumstances  discussed  above,  in  essence,  reflect  the
conundrum  concerning  the  relation  between  temporal  durations  in  inertial
reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another.    At
first, it seems there is no problem at all.  In each scenario, a clock is designated
at rest in one of the inertial reference frames (e.g., Q) and is considered moving
with uniform translational velocity  relative  to  an  observer  at  rest  in  the  other
inertial reference frame (e.g., P).  This all seems very straightforward.  One is
dealing with a clearly designated clock, the particular motion of which is clearly
delineated for observers at rest in their respective inertial reference frames.  The
problem comes when one notes that the time of this clock is measured  by  the
observer in P for whom the clock is moving in a uniform translational manner
by using at least two clocks that are at rest in this observer's  inertial reference
frame.  The problem arises because an observer at rest in the inertial reference
frame Q which has what the observer in P considers the "moving" clock instead
considers  his  own  reference  frame  Q  in  which  he  is  at  rest  the  "stationary"
reference frame and the other inertial reference frame P,  including the clocks at
rest  in  it,  moving  in  a  uniform  translational  manner  relative  to  his  reference
frame.  In terms of the modification of the twin paradox at issue in this paper,
both twins correctly maintain in terms of the special theory that the other twin is
aging more slowly.

The Relations Between Spatial Lengths in Inertial Reference Frames

A similar effect occurs for spatial length as well.  The relation for spatial
lengths in the  two  inertial  frames  W  and  W'  for  the  circumstance  where  the
observer at rest in W' considers the length of a rod at rest in W is:

D x' = D x(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (3).

- 10 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

In this scenario, W'  is  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  W  is  the
"moving" inertial reference frame.  For the circumstance where the observer at
rest  in  W  considers  the  length  of  a  rod  at  rest  in  W'  and  aligned  along  the
direction of relative motion of W and W', the relation is:

D x = D x'(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (4).

In this scenario, W  is  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  W'  is  the
"moving" inertial reference frame.

As  with  the  case  of  time  and  clocks,  the  analysis  would  seem  very
straightforward.  A rod can be at rest in one inertial reference frame and moving
with a uniform translational velocity relative to another inertial reference frame.
If the rod is at rest in W,  then the relation between the lengths of the rod in W
and  W'  is  given  by  equation  3.    (As  noted,  in  this  scenario,  W'  is  the
"stationary" inertial reference  frame  and  W  is  the  "moving"  inertial  reference
frame.)  This circumstance is depicted in Figure 3.  If a rod of length 10 units is
at rest in W, the length of this rod is less than 9 units in W'.   The dashed line
represents  part  of  the  world  line  of  the  end  of  the  rod  that  is  situated  at
x = 10 when t = 0 in W where it is at rest.  In order to measure the length of the
rod in W',  the "stationary" reference frame,  the  coordinates  corresponding  to
the  ends  of  the  rod  must  be  determined  simultaneously  in  W'.    Since  it  is
known that the spatial and temporal origins of W and W'  overlap, it is known
that the end of the rod situated at x = 0 and t = 0 in W will have the coordinates
x' = 0 and t' = 0 in W'.   In W',  the spatial coordinates of the other end of the
rod corresponding to t' = 0 can be determined by the intersection of the world
line of the rod with the x'  axis in W'.   This  point,  as  shown  in  Figure  3,  is
between 8 and 9 units.3

If, instead, the rod is at rest in W', then the relation between the lengths
of the rod in W  and  W'  is  given  by  equation  4.    In  this  scenario,  W  is  the
"stationary" inertial reference frame and W'  is  the  "moving"  inertial  reference
frame.  This circumstance is illustrated in Figure 4.4

The  problem  arises,  though,  that  one  can  argue  the  relativity  of
simultaneity and thus derive  the  Lorentz  coordinate  transformation  equations,
upon which equations 3 and 4,  as well as  equations  1  and  2,  are  dependent,
beginning with either  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational
motion relative to one another.  It is because one can begin the argument with
either  reference  frame  and  establish  simultaneity  in  either  of  the  inertial

that  there  are  two  reciprocal  sets  of  equations  relating  spatial  lengths  and
temporal durations for inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion
relative to one another.

If  it  were  not  possible  to  begin  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  and  first  establish  simultaneity  in  either  inertial  reference  frame,
one  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  would  be  a  preferred  inertial  reference
frame,  and  the  establishment  of  simultaneity,  and  thus  time  and  as  will  be
shown  space,  in  this  reference  frame  would  be  primary.    This  feature  is
associated with the fundamental tenet of the special theory that descriptions of
physical  phenomena  from  either  of  two  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform
translational motion relative to one another are equivalent for observers at rest in
their respective inertial reference frames.  If this tenet did not hold,  there would
exist the possibility of unique descriptions of  physical  phenomena  in  the  two
inertial reference frames.  The inertial reference frame in which simultaneity is
first  established  would  be  the  inertial  reference  frame  from  which  the
description of physical phenomena would be considered more fundamental.

A discussion of the underlying foundation of the relationships between
spatial lengths and  temporal  durations  in  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform
translational motion relative to one another follows.  First, how the relations for
spatial lengths and temporal durations between inertial reference frames having
a  uniform  translational  velocity  relative  to  one  another  are  dependent  on  the
Lorentz  coordinate  transformation  equations  is  shown.    Second,  how  the
relations  for  spatial  length  and  temporal  duration  and  the  Lorentz  coordinate
transformation equations depend on the relativity of simultaneity will be shown.
Then,  the  arbitrary  decision  concerning  which  inertial  reference  frame  is
"stationary"  and  which  "at  rest"  in  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  will  be
demonstrated using Einstein's  1917  argument.(4)    (As  discussed  previously,
"stationary" refers to  the  reference  frame  where  the  argument  concerning  the
relativity  of  simultaneity  begins,  where  simultaneity,  and  thus  time,  is  first
established  for  one  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational
motion  relative  to  one  another.    "Moving"  essentially  refers  to  the  reference
frame where the time of the "stationary" reference frame is introduced in order
to  determine  whether  the    criterion  of  simultaneity  in  the  "moving"  frame  is
met.)

It will be shown  that the relativity  of  simultaneity  can  be  argued  with
either inertial reference frame considered  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  and
the  other  reference  frame  considered  the  "moving"  reference  frame.    This

- 14 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

arbitrary characteristic of the argument on the relativity of simultaneity impacts
the Lorentz coordinate transformation equations  as  they  are  dependent  on  the
relativity of simultaneity in the special theory.  This arbitrary characteristic also
impacts the relationships between the spatial lengths of a physical existent and
the temporal durations of an occurrence in inertial reference frames moving in a
uniform translational manner relative to one another and to other results in the
special theory.

In  the  special  theory,  because  the  decision  in  which  direction  (i.e.,
which inertial reference  frame  is  designated  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference
frame as it is  in  this  frame  that  simultaneity  is  first  established)  to  argue  the
relativity of simultaneity is not constrained by any physical  or  mental  factors,
the  decision  is  freely  made  by  the  individual  making  the  argument.    The
decision is a cognitive act on the part of this individual, and this cognitive  act
has consequences for events in the physical world.   This cognitive act and  its
direct relation to the physical world depends on, and also serves to explain, the
feature  of  the  physical  world  that  an  observer  at  rest  in  an  inertial  reference
frame  considers  this  frame  "stationary".    This  feature  of  the  physical  world
allows  for  the  fundamental  tenet  of  the  special  theory  that  descriptions  of
physical  phenomena  from  either  of  two  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform
translational motion relative to one another are equivalent for observers at rest in
their respective inertial reference frames.

Spatiotemporal Relations and the Lorentz Transformation Equations

Two  sets  of  reciprocal  relations  have  been  discussed  that  relate  the
temporal  durations  of  an  occurrence  and  the  spatial  lengths  of  a  physical
existent in inertial reference frames in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to
one another.  One set of relations (set 1) is comprised of equations 1 and 3 and
is pictorially represented in Figures 1 and 3.  The other set of relations (set 2) is
comprised of equations 2 and 4 and is pictorially represented in Figures 2 and
4.

Set  1 

is  most  naturally  derived  from 

the  Lorentz  coordinate
transformation  equations  5  and  6.    The  term  most  naturally  means  that  the
inertial  reference  frame  designated  the  "stationary"  frame  and  the  inertial
reference frame designated the "moving" frame in the derivation of the Lorentz
coordinate transformation equations retain their roles  in  the  spatial  length  and
temporal duration relations in set 1.5  Equations 5 and 6 are:

x = (x' + vt')/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (5)

- 15 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

and

t = [t' + (v/c2)x']/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (6).

Set  2  is  most  naturally  derived  from  the  Lorentz  coordinate  transformation
equations:

x' = (x - vt)/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (7)

and

t' = [t - (v/c2)x]/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (8).
The derivations of equations 2  and  4  using  equations  7  and  8  follow
immediately.    The  derivation  of  equation  3  using  equations  7  and  8  is  then
carried  out  in  the  section,  "How  Spatiotemporal  Relations  Between  Inertial
Reference Frames Depend on the Relativity of Simultaneity."   This  derivation
will  show  the  significance  of  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  in  the  equations
relating  spatial  extension  of  physical  existents  and  temporal  duration  of
occurrences in inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative
to one another.  It does so,  though,  by switching in  midstream,  so  to  speak,
which inertial reference frame is the "stationary" reference frame and which the
"moving"  reference  frame. 
the  Lorentz  coordinate
transformations  derived  with  one  inertial  reference  frame  the  "stationary"
reference  frame  and  the  other  inertial  reference  frame  the  "moving"  inertial
reference frame can be used to deduce the relation between spatial lengths and
temporal  durations  for  these  reference  frames  where  the  "stationary"  frame
becomes the "moving" frame and the "moving" frame becomes the "stationary"
frame.  It should be emphasized that this is possible only because the relativity
of  simultaneity  can  be  argued  in  either  direction,  that  is  with  either  inertial
reference frame designated the "stationary" reference frame and the other inertial
reference frame designated the "moving" inertial reference frame.

  It  is  shown 

that 

5.1.

The Derivation of Equation 2

W and  W'  have  been  specified  as  one  dimensional  spatial  coordinate
systems moving in a uniform translational manner relative to one another along
their respective spatial axes, x of W and x' of W'.   This relative motion can be
determined from either W or W' by observers O (at rest in W) and O' (at rest in
W').  Allow that O considers W' to be in uniform, translational motion with the
velocity v along the x and x' axes in the direction of increasing values of x and
x'.  In this scenario, W is the "stationary" inertial reference frame and W'  is the
"moving"  inertial  reference  frame.    Also,  for  O,  at  rest  in  W,  W  is  the

- 16 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

"stationary" inertial reference frame and W'  is  the  "moving"  inertial  reference
frame.    Then  the  Lorentz  transformation  equations  of  special  relativity  for
transforming space and time coordinates for W (represented by the variables x
and t,  respectively) and space and time coordinates for W'  (represented  by  x '
and t', respectively) are equations 7 and 8.  (Equations 7 and 8 are the relevant
equations instead of equations 5 and 6 because in the argument on the relativity
of simultaneity, W is considered "stationary" by O and O considered W'  to be
"moving.")  (These same circumstances will hold for the derivation of equation
4 as well.)

Multiplying  both  sides  of  equation  8  by  (1  -  v2/c2)1/2  and  adding
(v/c2)x  to  both  sides  of  this  equation,  one  obtains:  t  =  t'(1  -  v2/c2)1/2  +
(v/c2)x.   The  goal  is  to  determine  t2  -  t1  (i.e.,  the  temporal  duration  in  W)
corresponding to the temporal duration measured by a "moving" clock, which
is at rest in W' (i.e.,  at a particular location x1').   For t1 and t2 in W,  the last
equation becomes:

t1 = t1'[1 - v2/c2]1/2 + (v/c2)x1

and

t2 = t2'[1 - v2/c2]1/2 + (v/c2)x2

where x1 and x2 are coordinates in W such that x1' is the particular value in W '
corresponding to the values x1 and x2, and t1'  and t2'  are  the  corresponding
values 
  Equation  7  can  be  expressed  as
x = x'(1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt.  Substituting for x1 and x2 in the above equations for
t1 and t2, one obtains:

t2.

and

Now,

t2 - t1 = [[t2'(1 - v2/c2)1/2] +

[[v/c2][x1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt2]]] -
[[t1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2] +

[(v/c2)(vt2 - vt1)]

t2 - t1 = [[t2' - t1'][(1 - v2/c2)1/2]] +[(v2/c2)(t2 - t1)] .

Subtracting  [(v2/c2)(t2  -  t1)]  from  both  sides  of  the  above  equation,  one
obtains:

(t2 - t1) - [(v2/c2)(t2 - t1)] = [t2' - t1'][(1 - v2/c2)1/2]
(t2 - t1)(1 - v2/c2) = [t2' - t1'][(1 - v2/c2)1/2]
t2 - t1 = [[t2' - t1'][(1 - v2/c2)1/2]]/(1 - v2/c2) .

Thus,

With D

t' = t2' - t1',
t'/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (2).

t2 - t1 = (t2' - t1')/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 .
t = t2 - t1 and D
t = D
It  should  be  kept  in  mind  that  the  inertial  reference  frame  which  has
been designated "stationary," W,  could just as easily have been designated the
"moving" inertial reference frame.  W' could just as easily have been designated
the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  instead  of  the  "moving"  reference
frame.  In this alternative, scenario, equation 1 would have been derived using
equations 5 and 6.

5.2

The Derivation of Equation 4

Using  the  same  circumstances  involving  W  and  W'  specified  for  the
derivation of equation 2,  allow that the rod,  aligned  along  the  line  of  relative
motion,  in  our  example  is  at  rest  in  W'  and  is  thus  moving  with  uniform,
translational  velocity  v  relative  to  O.    As  in  the  previous  example,  W  is
considered the "stationary" frame and W' is considered the "moving" frame.  A
rod at rest in W'  is measured to be r units by O',  who is at rest  in  W'.    The
length of this rod when  measured  by  O  is  calculated  by  finding  the  absolute
value of the difference of the rod's  coordinates along the x  axis  (i.e.,  x1  and
x2) when measurements  of  these  coordinates  are  made  simultaneously  at  the
time  t1,  with  simultaneity  defined  specifically  for  W.    The  rod's  length  is
x2 - x1|, where the enclosure |    | represents the absolute value of the enclosed
difference.  Since the length of the rod in W' is known, equation 7 can be used
to determine the length of the rod in W.   Multiplying both sides of equation 7

x  =  x'(1 
determine
|x2 - x1| at a particular time t1.  (Since the coordinates of the end of the rod in
W  will  be  known  at  the  same  time  t1  in  W,  |x2  -  x1|  is  the  length  of  the
"moving" rod in W).   For the particular coordinates x1 and  x2  at  a  particular
time  t1,  the  last  equation  becomes  x1  =  x1'(1  -  v2/c2)1/2  +  vt1  and
x2  =  x2'(1  -  v2/c2)1/2  +  vt1,  where  x1'  and  x2'  are  the  corresponding  x '
coordinates in W'.  Now,

to 

|x2 - x1| =

|x2 - x1| =

|(x2'(1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt1) -
(x1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2+ vt1)|
|x2'(1 - v2/c2)1/2 - x1' (1 - v2/c2)1/2 +
vt1 - vt1|

|x2 - x1| = |(x2' - x1')(1 - v2/c2)1/2| ,

or with D x = |x2 - x1| and D x' = |x2' - x1'| ,

D x = D x'(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (4).

As |x2' - x1'| = r and is positive,

D x = r(1 - v2/c2)1/2  .
Just as equation 1 of set 1 could  have  been  derived  from  equations  5
and 6, instead of equation 2 of set 2 from equations 7 and 8,  so equation 3 of
set 1 could just as well have been derived from equation 5,  instead of equation
4 of set 2 from equation 7.  A summary of the circumstances for deriving set 1
and equations 5 and 6 is presented in Table 1 in Appendix 1.  A summary of the
circumstances for deriving set 2 and equations 7 and 8 is presented in Table 2 in
Appendix 1.

These tables illustrate the point that the same concrete circumstances in
the  physical  world  can  support  both  scenarios  concerned  with  the  relation
between the spatial lengths of physical existents  and  the  temporal  duration  of
occurrences in inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative
to one another.  That is, there may be similarly constructed measuring rods and
clocks at rest in each of these respective inertial reference frames.  The question
arises,  and will be addressed  later,  as  to  the  basis  for  the  different  empirical
results  regarding  the  spatial  lengths  of  physical  existents  and  the  temporal
durations of occurrences in these inertial reference frames if the same concrete
circumstances  in  the  physical  world  can  support  either  scenario.    Also,  the

- 19 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

lengths of the measuring rods at rest or the clocks at rest in an  inertial reference
frame will be found to depend on whether they  are  at  rest  in  the  "stationary"
reference  frame  or  the  "moving"  reference  frame.    This  last  feature  of  the
special  theory  serves  to  emphasize  that  the  spatiotemporal  structure  of  the
physical  world  does  not  depend  on  concrete  circumstances  in  the  physical
world.

6.

How Spatiotemporal Relations Between Inertial Reference Frames
Depend on the Relativity of Simultaneity

The central  importance  of  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  to  the  Lorentz
transformation for time coordinates, and thus to the functioning of clocks at rest
in their respective inertial frames in uniform translational motion relative to one
another, is shown by discussing the derivation of the length of a rod that is at
rest in W and  that  is  thus  a  moving  rod  for  O'  who  is  at  rest  in  W'.    This
derivation  will,  of  course,  demonstrate  the  importance  of  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  to  the  functioning  of  measuring  rods  at  rest  in  their  respective
inertial  reference  frames  and  also  to  the  Lorentz  transformation  equation  for
space coordinates along the axis of uniform translational velocity of the inertial
reference frames relative to one another.

As  noted,  W  and  W'  have  been  specified  as  one  dimensional  spatial
coordinate  systems  moving  in  a  uniform  translational  manner  relative  to  one
another  along  their  respective  spatial  axes.    This  relative  motion  can  be
determined from          either    W or W' by observers O (at rest in W) and O' (at rest in
W').  Allow that O considers W' to be in uniform translational motion with the
velocity v along the x and x' axes in the direction of increasing values of x and
x'.    That  is,  W  is  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  W'  is  the
"moving"  inertial  reference  frame  in  this  scenario. 
  Then  the  Lorentz
transformation equations of special  relativity  for  transforming  space  and  time
coordinates for W (represented  by  the  variables  x  and  t)  and  space  and  time
coordinates for W' (represented by x' and t') are:

x' = (x - vt)/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (7)

and

t' = [t - (v/c2)x]/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (8)

where v is the relative uniform translational motion of W and W'  and c is  the
invariant velocity of light in all inertial frames of reference.(5)

Let the length of a measuring rod that is at rest in either W or W',  and

- 20 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

which is aligned along the line of relative motion of W and W', be measured by
observers at rest with regard to the rod to be r units.   In the special theory, the
length of a similarly constructed and similarly aligned measuring rod at rest in
the other inertial frame will also be r units when  this  length  is  determined  by
observers at rest in the other frame.  But the length of the rod at rest in W',  for
example, will not  be  r  units  when  determined  by  observers  at  rest  in  W  for
which  the  rod  is  moving  at  the  uniform  translational  velocity  v  in  the  same
direction as W' is moving relative to W.  Rather, the length of the rod,  aligned
along the direction of relative motion of W and W' will be r(1 - v2/c2)1/2 units
for observers at rest in W (here the "stationary" frame), where v is  the uniform
translational velocity of one frame  relative  to  the  other,  c  is  the  constant  and
finite velocity of light in all inertial frames, and v is less than c.

6.1

Simultaneity and Spatial Measurement

Allow now that the measuring rod of concern is at rest in W,  instead of
W', and is thus moving with uniform translational velocity v relative to O'.   As
noted, this rod is measured to be r units by O.   The  length  of  this  rod  when
measured by O' is calculated by finding the absolute value of the difference of
the rod's coordinates along the x'  axis (i.e.,  x'1 and x'2)  when measurements
of these coordinates are made simultaneously at the time t'1,  with simultaneity
defined specifically for W'.   (Here W'  is the "stationary" frame and  W  is  the
"moving" frame.)  The rod's  length  is  |x'2  -  x'1|,  where  the  enclosure  |        |
represents the absolute value of the enclosed difference.  Since the length of the
rod in W is known, the Lorentz transformation equations 7 and 8 can be used to
determine the length of the rod in W'.  For D x' = |x'2 - x'1|, D x = r = |x2 - x1|,
and D

t = t2 - t1,
D x' = (D x - vD
t' = [D

t)/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (9)

t - (v/c2)D x]/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (10)

t'  =  0.    With  D

In equation 10,  it can be seen that there has to be a difference D
t  =  v/c2(r)  in
order  for  D
t'  =  0  in  equation  10,  D x'  can  be  derived  using
equation 9 because it is assured that the two ends of the rod are being measured
simultaneously  in  W'.    Since  it  is  necessary  that  D
t  =  (v/c2)r  in  order  that
t'  =  0,  D
t  has  a  non-zero  value  whenever  the  inertial  frames  are  moving
relative to one another.

To find D x', given that D
t = v/c2(D x):
D x' = (D x - v(v/c2(D x)))/(1 - v2/c2)1/2

D x' = (D x)(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (3).
Equation 10 is an expression of the relation between temporal durations
of an occurrence in these inertial reference frames, and the term v/c2(r) reflects
the relativity of simultaneity in the special theory.   Further,  equation  8  of  the
Lorentz coordinate transformation equations, from which equation 10 is simply
derived,  contains  the  term  v/c2(x).    It  is  also  shown  that  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  is  central  to  the  relation  between  spatial  extension  in  inertial
reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another.    It  is
clear  from  an  inspection  of  equations  5  through  8  that  space  and  time  are
dependent on one another in the Lorentz  coordinate  transformation  equations.
Not surprisingly, the  Lorentz  coordinate  transformation  equations  themselves
depend on the relativity of simultaneity.5,6

Equations 7 and 8  of  the  Lorentz  coordinate  transformation  equations
are derived with W the "stationary" frame and W'  the "moving" frame.  What
has been done in the derivation of equation 3 here  is  to     switch      which  inertial
reference frame is "moving" and which "stationary" by making D
t'  = 0 through
t  =  0  as  was  done  in  the  derivation  of  D x  =

D x'(1  - v2/c2)1/2 (4) using equation 7.   In setting  D
t'  =  0,  one  is  concerned
with the  length  of  the  "moving"  rod,  at  rest  in  W  (the  "moving"  frame),  as
measured from W' (the "stationary" frame).  In setting D
t = 0 in the derivation
of  equation  4  from  equation  7,  one  is  concerned  with  the  length  of  the
"moving" rod,  at rest in W'  (the  "stationary"  frame),  as  measured  in  W  (the
"moving" frame).  It should be noted that this analysis in which equation 3 was
derived using equations 7 and 8 could instead have been argued using equations
5 and 6.  Then, equation 4 would have been the result.

Now  Einstein's  argument on the relativity  of  simultaneity  needs  to  be
presented, and it needs to be shown that the argument can be made from    either   
direction, with either inertial reference  frame  the  "stationary"  frame  while  the
other  frame  is  designated  the  "moving"  inertial  reference  frame  once  the
"stationary"  frame  in  a  scenario  has  been  designated.    Furthermore,  the
arbitrary choice in which direction the relativity of simultaneity is argued needs
to  be  shown.    The  point  needs  to  be  elaborated  that  these  directions,  each
carrying their own distinct empirical results (as has been shown  concerning the
relationship between temporal durations of  occurrences  and  spatial  lengths  of
physical existents for inertial reference frames in  uniform  translational  motion
relative  to  one  another),  are  reflected  in  observers  being  at  rest  in  their
respective  inertial  reference  frames  and  experiencing  their  inertial  reference
frame as "stationary" and concluding that  the  other  inertial  reference  frame  is
"moving."  It is this experience on the part of observers that allows there to be
an arbitrary decision on the part of the individual considering the argument on
the relativity of simultaneity or, for that matter, the relationship between spatial
lengths of objects  and  temporal  durations  of  occurrences  in  inertial  reference
frames in uniform translational velocity relative to one another.

Just as there can be no physical constraint pointing to one or the other of
the  inertial  reference  frames  being  favored  in  terms  of  the  description  of
physical  phenomena,  so  there  can  be  no  mental  constraint  as  well.    That
observers  at  rest  in  their  inertial  reference  frames  consider  their  respective
frames the "stationary" reference frame indicates there is no mental constraint.
The circumstances, both physical and mental, are presented pictorially in Tables
1 and 2, and it can be seen that the same concrete circumstances in the physical
world  as  well  as  the  mental  circumstances  of  the  observers  at  rest  in  their
inertial reference frames are the same in both tables.

There are those, such as Grünbaum(6) and Winnie(7,8), who maintain
essentially  that  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  is  not  necessary  to  derive  other
results  of  the  special  theory.    As  Franzel(9)  noted,  those  adhering  to  a
conventionalist  position,  such  as  Grünbaum,  maintain  that  the  round  trip
velocity of light used in establishing simultaneity in the special theory does not

- 23 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

necessarily entail that  the  velocity  of  this  light  is  in  each  direction  the  same.
That  is,  even  though  the  averaged,  round  trip  velocity  agrees  with  the
empirically determined velocity of light in vacuo, its one-way velocity need not
be in agreement with the empirically determined value.  Franzel also noted that a
kind  of  "practical"  absolute  simultaneity  is  possible  as  an  alternative  to  the
relativity  of  simultaneity  developed  by  Einstein.    The  point  missed  by  such
adherents  to  these  other  positions  is  the  theoretical  simplicity  and  yet
fundamental and far reaching ramifications of the argument on the relativity of
simultaneity as regards the special theory.  It is not difficult to show that it is the
relativity  of  simultaneity,  as  opposed  to  the  absolute  simultaneity  of  the
kinematics underlying Newtonian mechanics,  that  distinguishes  the  results  of
the  special  theory  from  the  results  of  Newtonian  mechanics.    It  has  been
shown,  for example, in the present paper how the relativity of  simultaneity  is
central 
the
spatiotemporal relations that underlie the other results of the special theory.  It
should  be  emphasized  that  the  concern  in  the  present  paper  is  not  with
attempting  to  refute  the  significance  of  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  in  the
special  theory.    The  concern  is  with  investigating  certain  implications  of  the
relativity of simultaneity in the special theory.

Einstein's 1917 Argument on the Relativity of Simultaneity

The relativity of simultaneity will  be  argued  using  a  slightly  modified
version of Einstein's 1917 gedankenexperiment (i.e.,  thought experiment).(10)
The gedankenexperiment involves a railway train that is moving with a uniform
translational velocity v along an embankment.  Both the train and embankment
are considered inertial frames of reference.

An observer (Ot)  is  located  on  the  railway  train  midway  between  the
ends of the train.  In addition, an observer (Oe) is located midway between the
points on the embankment corresponding to the ends of the train just  when two
lightning flashes strike the ends of the train.  Let the motion of the train and the
light flash in event A have the same direction in the frame of the embankment,
and  the  motion  of  the  train  and  the  light  flash  in  event  B  have  opposite
directions in the frame of the embankment.

Einstein  wrote  concerning  the  special  theory  that  two  events,  which
each give off  a  flash  of  light,  may  be  considered  simultaneous  in  an  inertial
frame  of  reference  when  an  observer  located  midway  between  the  spatial
locations of the events observes these flashes of light emitted in both events at

- 24 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

the same time.(11)  According to Einstein's argument, due to the postulated and
empirically  validated  invariant  velocity  of  light,  the  two  lightning  flashes  in
events A and B meet at the observer O who  is  located  at  the  midpoint  of  the
embankment.    The  events  A  and  B  in  which  these  flashes  occurred  are
considered simultaneous in the frame of the  embankment,  in  accordance  with
Einstein's  definition.    (Please  see  Figure  5.)    Here,  the  embankment  is  the
"stationary" inertial reference frame, the reference frame where the argument on
the relativity of simultaneity begins.   It is the inertial reference frame in which
simultaneity, and thus time, is first established for one of the inertial reference
frames.  Einstein described this scenario in the following way:

When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with
respect to the  embankment,  we  mean:  the  rays  of  light  emitted  at  the
places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the mid-
point M of the length A --> B of the embankment.  But the events A and
B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M'  be the mid-
point  of  the  distance  A  -->  B  on  the  travelling  train.    Just  when  the
flashes1  of  lightning  occur  [that  result  in  the  flashes  of  light  noted
above], this point M' [the midpoint of the train] naturally coincides with
the point M [the midpoint of that part of the embankment corresponding
to  the  "moving"  train],  but  it  moves...with  the  velocity  v  of  the
train.(12)

To which reference frame are the flashes of lightning referred to first?  In which
reference frame are they used in an attempt to establish simultaneity, and  thus
also time, first in accordance with Einstein's  definition?  Einstein answered the
question in writing  that  "the  rays  of  light  at  the  places  A  and  B...meet  each
other at the mid-point M of the length A --> B of the embankment."  He  also
answered  these  questions  when  he  wrote  in  the  footnote  appended  to  the
phrase, "Just when the flashes1 of lightning occur":

1 As judged from the embankment.(13)

It is the time in the reference frame of the embankment which is given priority
and established first in Einstein's argument on the relativity of simultaneity.

But,  Einstein argued, the  situation  for  the  observer  Ot  on  the  train  is

different.  Einstein wrote:

are the events at which light flashes are emitted from the postions of 
the embankment corresponding to the ends of the train with the frame

Now  in  reality  (considered  with  reference  to  the  railway
embankment) he [the observer on the train] is hastening [italics
added] towards the beam of light coming from B,  whilst  he  is
riding on ahead [italics added] of the beam of light coming from
A.  Hence the observer will see the beam of light emitted from B
earlier than he will see that emitted from A.  Observers who take
the railway train as their reference-body must therefore come to
the conclusion that the lightning flash B took place  earlier  than
the lightning flash A.(14)
Where the frame of the embankment is the "stationary"  frame,  for  Ot,
the lightning flashes have different effective velocities,  depending  on  whether
the particular beam is moving in the same or  opposite  direction  to  that  of  the
train.  (The measured velocity of light by Ot is,  of course,  the same finite and
invariant  value  it  has  in  all  inertial  reference  frames.    It  is  this  finite  and
invariant value that is central to Einstein's criterion for simultaneity in an inertial
reference frame.)  In the case where the train has the uniform velocity v and the
lightning  flashes  have  the  invariant  velocity  c  for  the  observer  O  on  the
embankment, the light flash from A has the effective velocity c - v and the light
flash from  B  has  the  effective  velocity  c  +  v  relative  to  the  observer  on  the
train.7  In Figure 6,  it can be seen that the flashes of light do not  meet  at  the
observer Ot who is at rest  midway  between  the  ends  of  the  train.    When  Ot
applies  Einstein's  criterion  for  simultaneity  for  an  inertial  reference  frame  to
these light flashes, he finds the criterion is not met.  Thus,  Einstein concluded
that  two  occurrences  which  are  simultaneous  for  the  observer  at  rest  in  the
inertial frame of the embankment are not simultaneous for the observer at rest in
the inertial frame of the train.  (In that the observer on  the  train  "is  hastening
towards the beam from light from B,  whilst he is riding on ahead of the beam
of light coming from A," Einstein again confirmed that the observer on the train
is  using  the  time  of  the  reference  frame  of  the  embankment  to  determine
whether  simultaneity  of  the  reference  frame  of  the  embankment  holds  in  the
reference frame of the train as well.)

In Einstein's scenario, the train is the "moving" inertial reference frame,
the reference frame where the time of the "stationary" reference frame is applied
through the use of the terms c - v and c  +  v  to  determine  whether  Einstein's
criterion for simultaneity in the reference frame of the train is met.  In terms of
the  space  of  the  inertial  reference  frame  of  the  railway  embankment,  the
midpoint  of  the  train  will   be  displaced   by  vD
t,   where  v   is  the  uniform

are the events at which light flashes are emitted from the postions of

translational velocity of the train relative to the embankment and D
t is the time in
the reference frame of the embankment taken by the rays of light that strike the
ends of the train to reach O at the midpoint of the embankment.

Further discussion is needed on this last point concerning the arbitrary
nature of deciding which frame is "stationary" and which is "moving"  for  the
purpose  of  arguing  the  relativity  of  simultaneity.    The  argument  presented
above concerning the relativity of simultaneity may be applied almost exactly to
the situation in the train gedankenexperiment where the observer at rest on the
train  is  considered  at  rest  in  the  "stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  the
observer at rest on the embankment is considered at rest in the "moving"  inertial
reference frame.  Indeed, the only two changes are: 1) the switch of  roles as to
which frame is the "stationary" frame and which the "moving" frame  (i.e.,  in
which  inertial  reference  frame  simultaneity  is  first  established),  and  2)  the
reversal in direction of the velocity of the embankment and the train relative to
one another.8    In  the  scenario  where  the  train  is  considered  the  "stationary"
frame and the embankment the "moving" frame, because of the postulated and
empirically validated invariant velocity of light, the two light flashes meet at the
observer Ot located midway on the train.  The motion of the embankment and
the light flash from B have the same direction in the frame of the train, and the
motion of the embankment and the light flash from A have opposite directions
in the frame of the train.  (Please see Figure 7.)

The lightning flashes are  considered  simultaneous  in  the  frame  of  the
train  (in  this  scenario,  the  "stationary"  reference  frame),  in  accordance  with
Einstein's definition of simultaneity.  As deduced by the "stationary" observer
on the train, the light flash in A has the velocity c + v relative to the "moving"
observer  on  the  embankment  and  the  light  flash  in  B  has  the  velocity  c  -  v
relative to the observer on the embankment.  In Figure 7, it can be seen that the
flashes of light do not meet at the observer Oe who is at rest midway between
the  ends  of  the  embankment.    When  Oe  applies  Einstein's  criterion  for
simultaneity for an inertial reference frame to these  light  flashes,  he  finds  the
criterion is not met.  Similar to the first scenario, it can be concluded that two
occurrences which are simultaneous for the observer at rest in the  inertial frame
of the train are not simultaneous for the observer at rest in the inertial frame of
the embankment.

There  is  nothing  that  points  in  any  way  to  an  individual  arguing  the
relativity of simultaneity in one direction or the  other,  that  is  with  one  of  the
reference  frames  more likely  than the  other to  be designated  the  "stationary"

frame.  If one were more likely, the fundamental tenet of the special theory that
there is  no  preferred  reference  frame  as  concerns  the  description  of  physical
phenomena for observers at rest in their respective inertial reference frames  in
uniform translational motion relative to one another would be violated.   There
would  be  a  preferred  inertial  reference  frame,  and  it  would  be  the  frame
designated the "stationary" frame.  There is thus a free choice on the part of the
individual  making  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  as  to  which
direction the argument should proceed.  In that this choice is not limited by any
physical factor in the special theory in any way, it can be said that the choice is
fundamentally a cognitive one,  not  reducible  to  some  physical  substrate,  and
that this cognitive choice is reflected in distinct sets of empirical results  found
when  certain  measurements  are  taken  in  the  physical  world.    Whichever
direction  is  chosen,  this  direction  will  correspond  to  a  distinct  set  of  results
obtained  by  an  observer  at  rest  in  his  inertial  reference  frame  and  which  he
considers  the  "stationary"  reference  frame.    It  should  be  noted  that  the
assumption,  supported  empirically,  that  an  observer  at  rest  in  his  inertial
reference frame considers this reference frame "stationary" and the other inertial
reference frame "moving" supports the  premise  that  there  is  no  mental  factor
that prompts an individual to argue the relativity of simultaneity in one direction
or the other.

8.

The Arbitrary Decision in the Argument on the Relativity of
Simultaneity

The basic point is this.    If  the  railway  embankment  is  considered  the
"stationary" reference frame,  then  in  Einstein's  argument  simultaneity  is  first
established in this inertial reference frame in terms of  the motion of  light.  The
light flashes leaving from the points of the  embankment  corresponding  to  the
ends of the train meet midway on the embankment between these  two  points.
As concerns the train, these light flashes certainly do not meet midway on the
train.  This is seen in an inspection of Figure 5.   As noted, simultaneity in the
reference frame of the embankment is defined as the meeting at C of  the  light
flashes represented by AC and BC.  As can be seen in Figure 6,  simultaneity in
the  train,  the  "moving"  reference  frame,  is  achieved  when  the  flash  leaving
from the end of the train in event A meets at event D what appears to be a new
flash leaving from the other end of the train in event E.  E is an event on the x '
axis.  That the event D represents the light flashes AD and ED meeting midpoint
on  the  train  is evident from  an  inspection  of  Figure 8,  which  essentially  is

8.1

The Spatial Length Along the Axis of Motion
of Physical Existents at Rest in the "Stationary"
and "Moving" Reference Frames

One  can  see  in  Figure  8  that  the  length  of  the  train  measured  by
observers at rest on the train is not 10 units but more than 10 units,  specifically
10/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 units,  because the light  flashes  AD  and  DE  meet  Einstein's
criterion that lights flashes from the ends of the train meet the observer at rest
located midpoint on the train when the train is considered the "moving" inertial
reference  frame.    In  greater  detail,  when  the  train  is  the  "moving"  reference
frame, the events A and D correspond to the ends of the train at the same time in
the  reference  frame  of  the  train  because  the  light  flashes  AD  and  DE  meet
Einstein's criterion for simultaneity.  Since A and D correspond to  the ends of
the train at the same time, the length from A to D is a measurement of the length
of the train for observers at rest in the "moving" reference frame  of  the  train.
This  length,  10/(1  -  v2/c2)1/2  units,  is  established  in  the  argument  on  the
relativity of simultaneity after length is established in the "stationary" frame of
the embankment where light flashes occur in events A and B that are equidistant
from the observer at rest in the "stationary" frame of the embankment.

Consider  the  reverse  scenario,  where  the  train  is  considered  the
"stationary" reference frame and the  embankment  is  considered  the  "moving"
reference  frame.    The  light  flashes  are  the  same  physical  phenomena  as  in
Einstein's  scenario.  In the reverse scenario, the light  flashes  AH  and  GH  in
Figure 9 are used to establish simultaneity in the inertial reference frame of the
train first in the argument on the relativity of simultaneity.  The light flashes AD
and DE, found in Figure 8, do not appear to be those flashes which are used to
establish simultaneity in the reference frame of the train in Figure 9.  One would
think  that  the  same  light  flashes  that  were  used  to  establish  simultaneity  in
Einstein's scenario would be used in the reverse scenario being discussed.   But
in comparing Figures 8 and 10 (where the space and time axes for the inertial
reference  frame  of  the  embankment  are  drawn  in),  one  can  see  even  more
clearly that this does not appear to be the case.

In  the  reverse  scenario,  the  circumstances  that  had  applied  to  the
"moving"  reference  frame  of  the  train  now  apply  to  the  "moving"  reference
frame   of   the  embankment   and  the  circumstances   that  had  applied to   the

"stationary" reference frame of the embankment now apply to the  "stationary"
reference frame of the train.  One would think this applies to the world lines of
the light flashes used to establish simultaneity in the "stationary" as well as the
"moving" inertial reference frames.  Regardless of the particular world lines of
the light flashes, the distance between the flashes in whichever inertial reference
frame is designated the "stationary" frame needs to be the same.  In the reverse
scenario, the distance between the light flashes used to establish simultaneity in
the "stationary" inertial frame of the train is 10 units, the length of the train.

One can see in Figure 10,  essentially Figure 9 with coordinates for the
frame of the embankment, the analogous circumstances to Figure 8, only which
reference  frame  is  "stationary"  and  which  is  "moving"  have  been  reversed.
When the embankment is the "moving" reference frame, the events A and I are
simultaneous in the "moving" reference frame of the embankment because  the
light flashes AI and FI meet Einstein's criterion for simultaneity.  Since A and I
correspond to points of the embankment at the same time, the length from A to I
is a measurement of the length of a section of the embankment for observers at
rest  in  the  "moving"  reference  frame  of  the  embankment.    This  length,
10/(1  -  v2/c2)1/2  units,  is  established  in  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  after  length  is  established  in  the  "stationary"  frame  of  the  train
where  light  flashes  occur  in  events  A  and  G  that  are  equidistant  from  the
observer at rest in the "stationary" frame of the train.

This interesting point should be emphasized.  The length of an existent
at rest in an inertial  reference  frame  as  measured  by  observers  at  rest  in  that
reference frame is dependent on whether the reference frame is considered the
"stationary" or "moving" reference frame  in  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity.  In Figure 9, it can be seen that the light flashes used to delineate
simultaneity  in  the  reference  frame  of  the  train  when  it  is  considered  the
"stationary" frame are from event A to event H and from event G to event H.
(Event  H  is  the  meeting  of  the  light  flashes  originating  in  events  A  and  G
midpoint on the train.)  Also, the light flashes from event A to event C and from
event B to event C found in Figure 8 do not represent light flashes meeting O
midpoint on the embankment when it is the "moving" inertial reference frame.
Rather, as seen in Figure 9, the lights flashes from event A to event I and from
event  F  to  event  I  represent  two  light  flashes  meeting  at  O  midpoint  on  the
embankment when the embankment is the "moving" inertial reference frame.  In
terms of the logical sequence in the argument on the relativity of simultaneity,
the  two  light  flashes  from  A  to  I  and  from  F  to  I  are  used  to  establish

- 36 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

simultaneity  in  the  "moving"  reference  frame  of  the  embankment     after   
simultaneity is first established in the "stationary" reference frame  of  the  train
using light flashes from A to H and from G to H.   In an inspection of Figure
10, one can see a bit more precisely that the light flashes striking the ends of the
train and the corresponding points on the embankment and which  are  used  to
establish simultaneity in the "stationary" inertial reference frame of the train do
not serve to establish simultaneity in the  "moving"  inertial  reference  frame  of
the embankment.  In Figure 10, the t coordinate for A is 0,  but the t coordinate
for G is close  to  5.    One  can  also  see  from  an  inspection  of  Figure  10  that
where the t' coordinate for A is 0, the t' coordinate for F is between -6 and -7.
For A and F,  x  =  0,  and  A  and  F  are  simultaneous  events  in  the  "moving"
inertial reference frame of the embankment.

What has occurred is  that  the  direction  in  which  the  argument  on  the
relativity  of  simultaneity  is  made  has  been  reversed,  and  this  reversal  has
changed the nature of space in a particular inertial reference frame such that the
length  of  the  concrete  measuring  rod  at  rest  in  this  reference  frame  and
measured by observers at rest in this reference frame is different depending on
whether the inertial reference frame in which the rod is at rest is the "stationary"
or  the  "moving"  reference  frame  in  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity. (The fundamental tenet is adjusted to: the description of physical
phenomena  must  be  the  same  for  observers  at  rest  in  their  inertial  reference
frames when these frames are the "stationary" reference frames in the argument
on the relativity of simultaneity and also the description of physical phenomena
must be the same for observers at rest in  their  inertial  reference  frames  when
these frames are the "moving" reference frames in this argument.)

There  is  nothing  in  the  physical  world  that  prompts  an  individual
considering inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to
one another to choose a particular direction in which to argue  the  relativity  of
simultaneity.    It  should  be  remembered  that  the  possibility  of  making  the
argument  in  either  direction  without  any  limitation  by  the  physical  world  is
central  to  retaining  the  central  tenet  of  the  special  theory  that  there  is  no
preferred inertial reference frame from which to describe physical phenomena.
If there were some reason in the physical world to  choose  one  direction  over
another,  there  would  be  a  preferred  inertial  reference  frame  from  which  to
describe  physical  phenomena.    The  choice  in  arguing  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  is  an  arbitrary  one,  a  free  one,  on  the  part  of  the  person
considering the relativity of simultaneity.  This arbitrary choice on  the  part  of

- 37 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

the  individual  considering  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  is  reflected  in  the
observers  each  being  at  rest  in  their  respective  inertial  reference  frames  in
uniform translational motion relative to one another and considering the inertial
reference frame in which each is at rest the "stationary" reference frame and the
other observer's inertial reference frame the "moving" reference frame.

One  might  think  that  the  different  scenarios  regarding  spatiotemporal
relations  can  be  distinguished  by  the  concrete  physical  existence  of  the
measuring rod in the case of spatial relations or clocks in the case of temporal
relations.    That  is,  it  might  be  thought  that  even  though  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  can  be  argued  in  either  direction,  in  practice,  only  one  scenario
applies  at  any  one  time  and  that  this  limitation  is  imposed  by  the  concrete
physical  world.    Essentially,  the  basis  for  this  thought  is  that  the  physical
mechanism of a clock or the physical structure of the rod are concrete, that is,
they  are  at  rest  in  only  one  inertial  reference  frame  and  that  their  basic
constitution remains unchanged in whatever inertial reference frame from which
they are considered.  It has been shown that with regard to measuring rods, this
is not the case.

More generally, the essence of the functioning of a clock in the special
theory  is  the  motion  of  light  over  a  prescribed  distance  in  both  possible
directions.  It is not the concrete existence of a clock that is at the essence of the
functioning of a clock in an inertial reference frame.  This is the case  because
the  synchronization  of  clocks  is  established  in  Einstein's  1905  and  1917
definitions of simultaneity (or the synchronization of clocks) by the motion of
light over a prescribed distance in both possible directions.(15)  This motion of
light can be considered periodic motion, and it is explicitly the periodic motion
of light between two spatial points A and B in an inertial reference  frame  that
Einstein relied upon in 1905 in defining simultaneity in his original paper on the
special theory.  Because the length of an existent in an inertial reference frame
depends  on  determining  the  ends  of  the  existent  simultaneously,  one  would
expect that the concrete nature of the existent would not inhibit the fundamental
character of the relativity of simultaneity.

8.2

The Time of the "Stationary" Inertial Reference Frame

In the argument on the relativity of simultaneity, the "moving" observer
relies on simultaneity and time of the "stationary"  frame  to  determine  that  the
criterion for  simultaneity  is  not  met  by  clocks  at  rest  in  the  "moving"  frame
because the "moving" observer relies on clocks synchronized in the "stationary"

frame to set clocks at rest in the "moving" frame and thus to determine whether
the  criterion  for  simultaneity  is  met  in  the  "moving"  frame.    This  has  been
shown in the train gedankenexperiment and will be shown in Einstein's original
argument on the relativity on simultaneity.  Einstein explicitly proposed in 1905
in his argument on the relativity of simultaneity that the clocks of the "moving"
frame  are  synchronized  in  accordance  with,  and  rely  on,  the  clocks  of  the
"stationary"  frame. 
train
gedankenexperiment that if the "moving" observer synchronized his own clocks
without relying on the synchronization of the clocks in the "stationary" inertial
frame, the clocks of the "moving" observer would not be subject to the effective
velocities c + v or c - v.  Instead, they only consider the light flashes in terms of
their finite and invariant velocity c.)

  (It  should  be  noted  with 

the 

regard 

to 

In his original paper on the special theory  of  relativity,  Einstein  noted
that simultaneity (or  the  common  time  of  clocks)  is  delineated  for  an  inertial
frame of reference when,  by definition, the time required for a ray  of  light  to
travel from a spatial point A to a spatial point B is equal to the time required for
a ray of light to travel from point B to point A.(16)  He argued the relativity of
simultaneity this way:

We  imagine  further  that  at  the  two  ends  A  and  B  of  the  rod
[moving  with  uniform  translational  velocity  relative  to  the
stationary inertial system], clocks are placed which synchronize
with the clocks of the stationary system,  that is to say that their
indications  correspond  at  any  instant  to  the  "time  of  the
stationary system" at the places where they happen to be.  These
clocks are therefore "synchronous in the stationary system."

We imagine further that with  each  clock  there  is  a  moving
observer,  and  that  these  observers  apply  to  both  clocks  the
criterion  established...for  the  synchronization  of  two  clocks
[that the flight time of a light ray in an inertial frame of reference
from spatial point A to spatial point B is equal to the flight time
of a light ray from point B to point A].  Let a ray of light depart
from A at the time* tA, let it be reflected at B at the time tB, and
reach  A  again  at  the  time  t'A.    Taking  into  consideration  the
principle of the constancy of the velocity of light we find that

where rAB denotes the length of the  moving  rod--measured  in
the stationary system.    Observers  moving  with  the  rod  would
thus  find  that  the  two  clocks  were  not  synchronous,  while
observers in the stationary system would declare the clocks to be
synchronous.
* Time here denotes "time of the stationary system"  and  also
"position of hands of the moving clocks situated at the place
under discussion."(17)

Whether using readings from clocks synchronized in the "stationary" frame or
the coincidence of flashes of light as judged from the railway embankment, the
"moving" observer relies on the time established first in the "stationary" frame
in the argument on the relativity of simultaneity.  This reliance by the "moving"
observer on the time established in the  "stationary"  reference  frame  sets  up  a
different basis for the development of simultaneity, and thus time, in his  own
frame than would otherwise have been the case if the  "moving"  observer  had
instead  been  the  observer  at  rest  in  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  in  the
argument on the relativity of simultaneity.

8.3

The Rate of Clocks at Rest in the "Stationary" and "Moving" Reference
Frames

It has been shown that the spatial length of a physical existent at rest in
an inertial reference frame and aligned along  the  axis  of  uniform  translational
motion  of  two  inertial  reference  frames  relative  to  one  another  depends  on
whether  the  reference  frame  in  which  the  rod  is  at  rest  is  designated  the
"stationary" or "moving" reference frame  in  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity.  A similar dependency holds for the rate of a clock in an  inertial
reference  frame.    The  rate  of  a  clock  at  rest  in  an  inertial  reference  frame
depends  on  whether  the  reference  frame  in  which  the  clock  is  at  rest  is
designated the "stationary" or "moving" reference frame in the argument on the
relativity  of  simultaneity.    In  Figures  11  and  12,  there  are  the  analogous
conditions  for  temporal  durations  in  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform
translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  to  those  used  to  explore  spatial
length.  In Figures 11 and 12,  Einstein's original argument on the relativity of
simultaneity  is  depicted  in  its  essential  elements.   Allow  that  a  distance  of

D x = 5 units is used to establish simultaneity in accord with Einstein's  original
criterion.  If a light flash travels from event A to event B,  traveling D x, and if
the light flash is reflected back without delay, it  requires  the  same  amount  of
time for the light flash to return to x = 0 from x = 5 (in event C) as it took for
the light flash to travel from event A to event B.  Einstein's original criterion for
simultaneity in an inertial reference frame is met and time is established in W,
the "stationary" frame.  Time in W is represented by the t axis.It can be seen in
Figure 11 that the simultaneity established in this process in W is not the same
as the simultaneity established in W'.  An inspection of this figure indicates that
simultaneity in W'  requires another process.   Allow that a rod is at rest in W '
and thus moving in a  uniform  translational  manner  relative  to  W  and  that  its
length as measured in W is 5 units.  Allow that in line with Einstein's  criterion,
a light flash begins in event A at one end of the rod,  travels to event D where it
reaches the other end of the rod,  and is immediately reflected back.  (Event D
occurs on  the  world  line  of  the  end  of  the  rod  toward  which  the  light  flash
travels after first being emitted.)  The light flash returns to the end  of  the  rod
that  it  originated  from  in  event  E  at  x'  =  0.    In  terms  of  the  time  of  W,

 tDE and thus Einstein's original criterion for establishing simultaneity is
not met in W' when this process is considered in terms of the time of W.  From
Figure 11, it can also be seen that t'AD »
 6 units and that simultaneity,
and  thus  time,  is  established  in  W'  in  accordance  with  Einstein's  original
criterion for simultaneity in an inertial reference frame.

 t'DE »

In terms of the time of W', t', the passage of the light ray from one end
of the rod to the other and back again occurs in about 12 units.  If the concern is
with the amount  of  time  that  elapses  in  W,  the  "stationary"  reference  frame,
corresponding  to  these  12  units  in  W',  the  "moving"  reference  frame,  the
horizontal  dashed  line  parallel  to  the  space  axis  for  W  indicates  that  the
corresponding time in W is between 13 and 14 units.

Figure  12  displays  the  reverse  scenario  where  W'  is  the  "stationary"
inertial reference frame and W is the "moving" inertial reference frame.  Allow
that a distance of D x' = 5 units is used to establish simultaneity in accord with
Einstein's  original criterion.  If a light flash travels from event  A  to  event  H,
that  covers  D x',  and  if  the  light  flash  were  reflected  back  without  delay,  it
requires the same amount of time for the light  flash  to  return  to  x'  =  0  from
x' = 5 (in event F) as it took for the light flash to travel from event A to event
H.  Einstein's original criterion for simultaneity in an inertial reference frame is
met  and  time  is  established  in  W',  the  "stationary"  frame.    Time  in  W'  is

represented  by  the  t'  axis.It  can  be  seen  in  Figure  12  that  the  simultaneity
established in this process in W' is not the same as the simultaneity established
in W.    An  inspection  of  this  figure  indicates  that  simultaneity  in  W  requires
another process.  Allow that a rod is at rest in W and thus moving in a uniform
translational manner relative to W'  and that its length as measured  in  W'  is  5
units.  Allow that in line with Einstein's criterion, a light flash begins in event A
at one end of the rod,  travels to event I where it reaches  the  other  end  of  the
rod, and is immediately reflected back.  (Event I occurs on the world line of the
end of the rod toward  which  the  light  flash  travels  after  first  being  emitted.)
The light flash returns to the end of the rod  that it originated from in event F at
x = 0.   In  terms  of  the  time  of  W',  t'AI  „
  t'IF  and  thus  Einstein's  original
criterion  for  establishing  simultaneity  is  not  met  in  W  when  this  process  is

t'AI »
 6 units and that simultaneity, and thus time, is established in W in
accordance  with  Einstein's  original  criterion  for  simultaneity  in  an  inertial
reference frame.

 t'IF »

In terms of the time of W, t, the passage of the light ray from one end of
the rod to the other and back  again  occurs  in  about  12  units  of  time.    If  the
concern is with the amount of time that elapses in W', the "stationary" reference
frame corresponding to these 12 units in W,  the "moving" reference frame, the
dashed line parallel to the  space  axis  for  W'  indicates  that  the  corresponding
time in W' is between 13 and 14 units.

Nothing physical is presented  to  distinguish  the  different  scenarios  in
the argument on the relativity of simultaneity.  All that distinguishes them is an
arbitrary  choice  on  the  part  of  the  individual  arguing  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  concerning  the  direction  in  which  the  argument  is  made.    This
arbitrary choice is anchored in the experience of observers that they are at rest in
their respective inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative
to one another and that each of their respective inertial reference frames  is  for
them "stationary" while the other reference frame is "moving."  This  arbitrary
choice concerning the direction in which to argue the relativity of simultaneity is
made implicitly when an individual is concerned with other results of the special
theory, for example the temporal duration of occurrences or the spatial length of
physical existents  in  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion
relative to one another.  And other results of the special theory depend on these
spatial and temporal relations.

An Interesting Circumstance

There is an interesting circumstance that results from the possibility  of
arguing the relativity of simultaneity in either direction, that is with either of two
inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another
designated the "stationary" frame while the other reference frame is designated
the "moving" frame.  This circumstance concerns the nature of the light flashes
used to establish simultaneity in the inertial reference frames, in the case of the
train  gedankenexperiment  the  embankment  and  the  train.    This  circumstance
serves  as  an  additional  indication  that  the  arbitrary  decision  as  to  which
direction to argue the relativity  of  simultaneity  has  an  impact  on  the  physical
world itself through affecting the light flashes seen by observers at rest in their
inertial reference frames in establishing simultaneity in  their  respective  inertial
reference  frames.    The  argument  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  affects  the
course in  the  physical  world  of  these  light  flashes.    This  effect  occurs  even
though the physical existence of the light flashes themselves appears not to be
impacted.  It is the same light flashes that are used in either scenario chosen.

There is a  set  of  four  world  lines  each  (or,  perhaps,  more  precisely,
three world lines of which one has a shorter element) for defining simultaneity
in  the  inertial  reference  frames  of  the  embankment  and  the  train  in  each
scenario.  There are two distinct sets,  one for each scenario.  The  scenario  in
which the chosen direction has the reference frame of  the  embankment  as  the
"stationary"  inertial  reference  frame  and  the  train  as  the  "moving"  inertial
reference frame is depicted in Figure 8.  In this scenario, the light flash emitted
in event A and meeting in event C the observer at rest midway on the section of
embankment the end positions of which correspond to the ends of the "moving"
train, and the light flash emitted in event B and meeting the light flash from A in
event C are used to establish simultaneity in the  "stationary"  inertial  reference
frame of the embankment.   The  light  flash  emitted  in  event  A  that  meets  the
observer at rest on the embankment in event C and travels to event D where it
meets the observer at rest midpoint on the train, and the light  flash  emitted  in
event E, from the other end of the train that meets the light flash from A in event
D are used to establish simultaneity in the "moving" inertial reference frame of
the train.

The  reverse  circumstance  can  be  seen  in  Figure  10.    Where  the  the
inertial  reference  frame  of  the  train  is  the  "stationary"  frame,  the  light  flash
emitted in event A and meeting in event H the observer at rest midway on the
train  the  ends  of  which  correspond  to  the  positions  on  the  "moving"

- 45 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

embankment where the lightning flashes struck,  and the  light  flash  emitted  in
event G and meeting the  light  flash  from  A  in  event  H  are  used  to  establish
simultaneity in the "stationary" inertial reference frame of the train.    The  light
flash  emitted  in  event  A  that  meets  the  observer  at  rest  midpoint  on  the
embankment in event I,  and the light flash emitted in event  F,  from  the  other
end of the embankment where lightning struck that meets the light  flash from A
in event I are used to establish simultaneity in  the  "moving"  inertial  reference
frame  of  the  embankment.    (Because  the  embankment  is  "moving"  in  the
direction of decreasing values of x'  and thus towards the light flash emitted in
event A, this light flash, in terms of the time of the "stationary" reference frame
of the train, meets the observer midpoint on the embankment in event I before
the light flash reaches the observer at rest midpoint on the train in event H.)

It  has  been  shown  that  it  is  an  arbitrary  decision  which  frame  is
considered the "stationary" reference frame and which the "moving"  reference
frame  in  Einstein's  argument  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity.    Thus,  the
question arises:  What is the relationship between the light flashes from A to C
in Figure 9 and from A to H in Figure 10, as well as those  light flashes from B
to C in Figure 9 and from G to H in Figure 10, that is between  the light flashes
that  are  used  to  establish  simultaneity  in  the  reference  frames  of  the
embankment  and  train  respectively  when  each  is  considered  the  "stationary"
inertial reference frame in the argument on the relativity of  simultaneity?    The
light  flashes  from  A  to  C  and  from  B  to  C  can  have  logical  priority  in  the
argument, or the light flashes from B to C and from G to H  can  have  logical
priority.    In  terms  of  the  argument,  there  is  only  this  logical  distinction,
arbitrarily  decided,  that  determines  within  each  scenario  which  of  the  two
different pairs of world lines will meet first and which will meet second.

How is it that there are two different sets of world lines in Figures 8 and
10 for the light flashes  used  to  establish  simultaneity  in  the  inertial  reference
frame  designated  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  in  the  argument  on  the
relativity of simultaneity?  Are the light flashes from A to C and from A to H the
same light flash?  Or are the light flashes from B to C and from G to H the same
light flash?  For that matter are the light flashes from A to D  in  Figure  8  and
from A to I in Figure 10 the same?  And are the light flashes E to D in Figure 8
and from F to I in Figure 10 the same?  As can be seen by their world lines in
Figures 8 and 10,  the members of each pair  appear  to  be  different  flashes  of
light in the context of their roles in one of the scenarios in the argument on the
relativity of simultaneity (i.e.,  with one inertial reference frame designated  the

- 46 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

"stationary" reference frame and the other inertial reference frame designated the
"moving"  reference  frame).    But  since  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity can be made in either direction without physical constraint and thus
with the same light flashes, it would seem that the light flashes from A to C and
from A to H are indeed the same light flash,  the light flashes from B to C and
from G to H are the same light flash, the light flashes from A to D and from A
to I are the same light flash,  and the light flashes from E to D and from F to I
are the same light flash.  One might expect that if this is the case, instead of two
world lines for each of the light flashes that play the same role in the argument
on the relativity  of  simultaneity,  albeit  in  different  scenarios,  there  would  be
only one world line for the light flashes.  Instead, the argument on the relativity
of simultaneity indicates that a light flash involved in establishing simultaneity
in an inertial reference frame has two world lines in the special theory.

Whose Clocks Run Slower?

The importance of an observer's considering himself at rest in an inertial
reference frame and the observer's  considering this reference frame at rest,  or
the  "stationary"  reference  frame,  to  the  special  theory  has  been  discussed.
Essentially, if it were not the case for all observers in inertial reference frames
in uniform translational motion relative to one another, there would exist some
distinction  between  the  observers'  experiences  of  motion  in  their  respective
inertial reference frames.  The relativity of simultaneity, as well as the Lorentz
coordinate  transformation  equations,  then  could  not  be  properly  derived.    A
preferred inertial reference frame would exist that would provide the basis  for
the spatial and temporal structure for the description of  events  in  the  physical
world.    Also,  if  there  were  some  difference  in  the  motion  experienced  by
observers at rest in their respective inertial reference frames, then the relativity
of simultaneity and the Lorentz coordinate transformation  equations  could  not
be derived with either inertial reference frame being  the  "stationary"  reference
frame and the other reference frame being the "moving" reference frame.

The central role of the arbitrary choice in the argument on the relativity
of  simultaneity  concerning  which  inertial  reference  frame  is  "stationary"  and
which  "moving"  in  the  special  theory  has  also  been  discussed.    Among  the
consequences  are  different  forms  of  the  Lorentz  coordinate  transformation
equations  and  different  equations  for  relating  the  spatial  length  of  physical
existents  along  the  axis  of  relative  motion  and  the  duration  of  occurrences
between two inertial reference frames moving in a uniform translational manner
relative to  one  another.    Unlike  the  twin  paradox  where  physicists  generally

- 47 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

maintain  that  one  twin  is  not  always  in  an  inertial  reference  frame,  in  the
problem  at  hand,  observers  are  always  at  rest  in  their  respective  inertial
reference frames.  Thus, the question remains, whose clock runs slower?

This  question  becomes  particularly  important  because  it  can  serve  to
emphasize that the exact same physical circumstances can provide the physical
basis for different empirical results, for example whose clocks run slower.   In
one scenario, an observer A,  who is in the "moving" inertial reference  frame,
has the clocks that run slower in comparison with the clocks that an observer B
has in the "stationary" reference frame.  In the other scenario, B's  clocks  run
slower than A's  clocks.  As we have seen,  nothing in the physical foundation
of these scenarios need be different.  Only the direction in which the relativity
of  simultaneity  is  argued  is  different  (which  inertial  reference  frame  is  the
"stationary" frame and which the "moving"  frame),  a  difference  that  depends
upon,  and helps to explain  the  significance  of,  the  experience  of  each  of  the
observers  being  at  rest  in  the  their  respective  inertial  reference  frames  and
considering their respective frames the "stationary" frame.

Indeed, if only one scenario held, there would be a preferred reference
frame,  the  reference  frame  in  this  scenario  from  which  the  other  inertial
reference frame is judged to be "moving."  This circumstance would violate the
fundamental tenet of the special theory that inertial reference frames in uniform
motion  relative  to  one  another  are  equivalent  for  the  description  of  physical
phenomena.    What  then  is  behind  the  different  empirical  results  if  it  is  not
something physical?  Whatever it is,  it must account first and foremost for the
different directions in arguing the relativity of simultaneity that is the foundation
for the other results  of  the  special  theory,  including  the  relationship  between
temporal  durations  and  spatial  distances  between  inertial  reference  frames  in
uniform translational motion relative to one another.  It is most likely that it is
some cognitive factor.  The first reason is that the distinction in direction is on
the level of the argument itself.  The second reason is that  there  is  a  decision
made  by  an  individual  considering  the  physical  circumstances  concerning  in
which  direction  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  is  to  be  argued,  which  inertial
frame is the "stationary" reference frame in which simultaneity is first  defined
and which the "moving" reference frame.

This decision is essentially a psychological act, one which has  distinct
consequences in the physical world depending  on  the  decision  made,  namely
distinct sets of empirical results that  support  the  special  theory,  including  the
temporal and spatial relationships between inertial reference frames in uniform

- 48 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

translational  motion  relative  to  one  another.    Concerning  the  distinct  sets  of
results,  each  is  just  as  likely  because  the  argument  on  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  can  be  argued  in  either  direction  without  physical  or  mental
constraint.  Either of the two inertial reference frames in  uniform  translational
motion relative to one another can be  designated  the  "stationary"  frame  while
the other frame is then designated the "moving" frame.  The decision to argue in
one  direction  or  the  other  direction  is  truly  a  free  one  on  the  part  of  the
individual making the argument and because this decision concerns an argument
while concrete physical circumstances can support either direction in which the
argument  may  be  made  without  prompting  a  decision  in  one  direction,  the
decision as to which direction to argue the relativity is cognitive in nature, not
reducible to a physical substrate, and impacts the physical world.

As noted, the  arbitrary  choice  concerning  the  direction  in  arguing  the
relativity of simultaneity extends to the problem raised at the beginning of this
paper,  namely  the  relation  of  temporal  durations  of  an  occurrence  in  inertial
reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another.  In this
case, the arbitrary decision as to the direction in which to argue the relativity of
simultaneity  leads  to  the  question  concerning  which  clocks  at  rest  in  inertial
reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  run
slower?  According to the analysis presented here, one would expect that each
observer  at  rest  in  his  inertial  reference  frame  and  considering  his  frame
"stationary" and the other frame "moving" would find that the other observer's
clocks are running slower by exactly the same amount.  Thus,  one should find
in  experiments  where  observers  at  rest  in  their  respective  inertial  reference
frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another determine the rate
of physical processes occurring  in  one  location  in  the  other  inertial  reference
frame (e.g., the rate of a clock at rest in this other inertial reference frame) that
both  observers  will  record  the  same  slowing  of  time  in  the  other  inertial
reference frame.  This condition is a test of the relationship of temporal duration
for some occurrence in both directions and is thus  a  test  of  the  possibility  of
arguing  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  in  both  directions  while  the  concrete
experimental  circumstances  in  the  physical  world  are  the  same  in  both
directions.

Experiments, though, have not in general tested this condition.  Instead,
experiments  testing  the  equations  derived  in  the  special  theory  concerning
spacetime  that  relate  the  durations  of  occurrences  or  the  length  of  physical
existents in inertial reference frames in uniform motion relative to one  another

On the Arbitrary Choice

have generally met one of two other conditions:

Condition 1: One frame is not always inertial in nature  (it  is  at

some point in its motion accelerating);

Condition 2: The test is made in only one direction, that is with
one  inertial  frame  considered  the  "stationary"  frame  and
the other inertial reference frame considered the "moving"
reference frame.

Examples of both conditions will be discussed.  This discussion of conditions 1
and 2 will demonstrate  the  significant  attention  devoted  to  them  and  place  in
contrast the relative lack of attention paid to empirically testing the relationship
between  temporal  duration  in  inertial  reference  frames  moving  in  uniform
translational motion relative to one another where each of the inertial reference
frames in one of the two scenarios is the "stationary" frame while the frame not
selected to be the "stationary" frame is the "moving" frame.

10.1 Clocks Flown Around the World

Hafele and Keating reported an  experiment  that  attempted  to  take  into
account a key aspect of the twin paradox  gedankenexperiment,  namely  where
one  reference  frame  is  always  considered  inertial  and  the  other  cannot  be
considered inertial in at least part of its motion.(18,19)  This experiment was a
test that met condition 1.   Hafele and Keating  compared  the  time  kept  by  the
atomic time scale of  the  U.S.  Naval  Observatory  with  the  time  kept  by  four
cesium clocks that were flown around the world in jet aircraft.  In one trip, the
clocks were flown eastward around the world,  and in another  trip,  they  were
flown westward around the world.  On each trip, the clocks were thus  involved
in  a  round  trip,  which  is  a  central  aspect  of  the  twin  paradox.    Hafele  and
Keating introduced a hypothetical inertial reference frame that  was,  of  course,
not rotating.

Using the  special  theory,  specifically  variations  of  equations  1  and  2
(the  equations  that  relate  the  durations  of  an  occurrence  in  inertial  reference
frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another), as well as taking
into account other considerations specific to their experiment including a general
relativistic consideration, Hafele and Keating developed predictions concerning
time differences between the time kept by the U.S.  Naval Observatory and the
four cesium clocks on their two trips.   They considered  both  the  U.S.  Naval
Observatory as well as the clocks circumnavigating the earth as part of rotating
reference frames relative to the hypothetical  inertial  reference  frame.    Though

- 50 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

these  rotating  reference  frames  experienced  acceleration,  Hafele  and  Keating
maintained  that  the  rotating  reference  frames  could,  in  essence,  constitute
inertial reference frames traveling in a uniform translational manner relative to a
hypothetical inertial reference frame.  Thus, the relation between the duration of
an  occurrence  in  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion
relative to one another would be applicable to these rotating  reference  frames.
Essentially,  they  considered  the  hypothetical  inertial  reference  frame  the
"stationary"  reference  frame  and  the  rotating  reference  frames  as  "moving"
reference frames.  The experimental results confirmed their predictions.

It should be  emphasized,  though,  that  their  experiment  concerned  the
twin paradox gedankenexperiment specifically and not the type of circumstance
of concern here.  It should also be emphasized that this was an indirect test as
clocks  in  the  hypothetical  inertial  reference  frame  were  not  involved  in  the
experimental measurement.    Both  the  clocks  in  their  circumnavigation  of  the
world and the U.S.  Naval Observatory were in accelerating  reference  frames,
reference frames for which the special theory, in general, does not provide an
adequate description.  The central point for Hafele and Keating though,  is that
as  noted,  the  twin  paradox  involves  one  twin  changing  direction  during  his
travel and the return of this twin to the other twin.  And for Hafele and Keating,
the clocks on the airplanes as well as the atomic time scale of the U.S.  Naval
Observatory are considered to have taken a roundtrip relative to the hypothetical
clocks in the inertial reference frame that have remained "stationary."

10.2

The Lifetime of m -mesons
Consider condition 2 where the the experiment has been conducted with
only one of the inertial reference frames considered the "stationary" frame and
the other inertial reference frame  considered  the  "moving"  frame.    Following
work by Rossi and Hall(20), Frisch and Smith(21) used the distribution of m -
meson decay as a clock.

As far as we know  the  probability  of  the  radioactive  decay  of
subatomic  particles,  and  thus  the  average  time  they  survive
before  decaying,  is  set  by  forces  entirely  internal  to  their
structure.  Therefore, any dependence  of  the  decay  probability
of radioactive particles on their speed is an example of a general
property of clocks in motion relative to an observer.(22)
Specifically, Frisch  and  Smith  determined  the  decay  distribution  over
time for m -mesons in the earth's atmosphere after they are brought to rest in an

- 51 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

inertial  reference  frame.    Using  this  decay  distribution,  Frisch  and  Smith
developed  predictions  both  with  and  without  time  dilation  concerning  the
number of m -mesons traveling at an average velocity of 0.99c  (where c  is  the
velocity  of  light)  that  would  survive  a  journey  of  1907  meters  downward
through  the  atmosphere  to  near  sea  level.    In  one  experimental  trial,  for
example, instead of the 27 m -mesons predicted to survive the journey out of a
total of 568 m -mesons if there were no time  dilation,  412  m -mesons  survived
the journey.  Using the m -meson decay distribution as a clock, this number of
surviving m -mesons indicated an elapsed time of 0.7  m sec. as compared to  an
elapsed time of 6.4  m sec.,  which  is  the  quotient  of  the  1907  meters  traveled
divided  by  the  velocity  of  the  m -mesons  (i.e.,  in  this  case  0.9552c).    The
observed  result  indicated  that  the  m -meson  clocks  were  "running  slow  by  a
factor of  about  nine"  relative  to  the  laboratory  reference  frame.(23)    Various
possible problematic factors, such as the deceleration of the m -mesons through
the atmosphere, were well accounted for by Frisch and Smith.  Using their data
in a different manner to that described above, Frisch and Smith derived a more
accurate value for the time dilation in their experiment and found  an  observed
time dilation factor of 8.8 + 0.8.  The predicted time dilation factor based on the
special theory for their experiment was 1/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = 8.4 + 2.

    

    

Though it sounds odd to mention, Frisch and Smith did not address the
point that theoretically the m -mesons could be considered to have been at rest in
"stationary" inertial reference frames and that the laboratory reference frame is
the "moving" inertial reference frame.  In this scenario, the laboratory reference
frame,  including  the  people  in  it,  would  be  aging  very  slowly,  roughly  8.5
times slower than when the laboratory reference frame  on  earth  is  considered
the "stationary" reference frame at rest.   If equation  1  is  used  to  describe  the
relation  between  the  temporal  durations  in  the  "stationary"  frame  of  the
laboratory reference frame and the "moving" frame of the m -mesons, equation 2
would  be  the  appropriate  equation  for  relating  temporal  durations  in  these
inertial reference frames in the reverse scenario that Frisch  and  Smith  did  not
consider.    In  their  discussion  of  the  m -meson  decay  experiment,  Feynman,
Leighton, and Sands(24) also did not discuss  the  theoretical  possibility  of  an
alternative scenario along the lines indicated above.

French(25)  did  consider  that  the  reciprocal  scenario  is  theoretically
possible.  He did so in order to demonstrate that the number of decays in both
scenarios would need to be the same.  French wanted to uphold the tenet  that
physical description  for  observers  at  rest  in  their  respective  inertial  reference

- 52 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  is  equivalent.
French did not consider the reciprocal scenario in order to emphasize the point
that  slower  aging  in  the  laboratory  reference  frame  on  earth  (when  it  is
considered the "moving" reference frame) is just as likely as slower aging, and
thus  rate  of  decay,  of  the  m -mesons  when  the  laboratory  reference  frame  is
considered the "stationary" reference frame.

10.3 A Test in Both Directions

It is predicted that, in accordance with the special theory, if a test were
made concerning the relative rate of clocks in two  inertial  reference  frames  in
uniform translational motion relative to one another, one would find that the rate
of the clock at rest in one inertial reference frame is slower to observers at rest
in the other inertial reference frame by exactly the same amount as a clock at rest
in this latter frame is slower to observers  at  rest  in  the  former  inertial  frame.
Observers at rest in an inertial frame A would find clocks at rest in inertial frame
B, moving in a uniform translational manner relative to A, run slow relative to
clocks in A by exactly the same amount that clocks at  rest  in  B  run  slow  for
observers at rest in A.  It seems that if the ingenuity that has been  devoted  to
developing  tests  of  the  twin  paradox  or  time  dilation  in  one  direction  were
directed  toward  developing  empirical  tests  of  time  dilation  in      both      directions
(i.e.,  in  which  each  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  is  in  one  scenario  the
"stationary" reference frame), empirical tests could be developed.   One specific
possibility will be discussed shortly.

This  prediction  of  time  dilation  in  both  directions  is  the  basis  for  an
empirical test of the relationship of temporal durations for some occurrence  in
inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another
in both directions.  It  is  the  basis  for  a  test  of  the  possibility  of  arguing  the
relativity  of  simultaneity  in  both  directions  while  the  concrete  experimental
circumstances in the physical world are the same.

Here  is  one  scenario  that  would  test  this  prediction  concerning  the
relative  rates  of  clocks  in  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational
motion relative to one another.  The test is indirect but, nonetheless, conclusive.
This scenario relies on the Doppler effect in the special theory.

Allow that two inertial reference frames (W and W')  with observers at
rest in each inertial frame (O and O', respectively) move away from one another
in  a  uniform  translational  manner  relative  to  one  another.    Let  there  be
identically constructed cesium clocks at rest in one or the other of these inertial

- 53 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

reference frames.  Whenever a specific unit of time is measured by the clocks at
rest in their respective inertial frames (for example, one hour),  let a light pulse
be emitted in the direction of the other inertial reference frame along the axis of
uniform  translational  motion  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  relative  to  one
another.  The longitudinal Doppler effect in the special theory predicts that the
relation of the frequencies measured by the observers at rest in their respective
inertial reference frames has two possible forms.   One form of the longitudinal
Doppler effect is:

f' = f ((c - v)/(c + v))1/2  (11)

where c is the invariant velocity of  light  in  inertial  reference  frames,  v  is  the
uniform  translational  velocity  of  the  inertial  reference  frames  relative  to  one
another, f' is the frequency of the light pulses measured by O' at rest in W'  that
emanate from the clock at rest in W,  and f is the frequency of the light pulses
from the clock at rest in W determined by O at rest in W.

The other form for the longitudinal Doppler effect is:
f = f' ((c - v)/(c + v))1/2  (12)

where f is the frequency of the light  pulses  measured  by  O  at  rest  in  W  that
emanate from the clock at rest in W', and f' is the frequency of the light pulses
from the clock at rest in W' determined by O' at rest in W'.

The longitudinal Doppler effect in the special theory is reciprocal.  That
the  relationship  in  the  special  theory  between  temporal  durations  of  an
occurrence in inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to
one  another  is  a  factor  in  the  longitudinal  Doppler  effect  can  be  seen  in  the
general formulation of the Doppler effect in the special theory.  One version of
this general formulation is:

f' = (f (1 - v2/c2)1/2)/(1 - (v/c)(cos Q

))  (13)

where  the  light  pulses  emanating  from  the  clock  at  rest  in  W  are  being
considered and cos   is the angle of the light ray in W relative to the axis along
which W and W' are in uniform translational motion relative to one another.  In
the case of the longitudinal Doppler effect where the clock is at rest in W  and
the  observer  at  rest  in  W'  are  moving  away  from  one  another,  Q
  and
cos Q

  =  p

 = -1.  Thus:
f' = (f (1 - v2/c2)1/2)/(1 + v/c)  (14)
f' = (f (1 + v/c)1/2 (1 - v/c)1/2)/(1 + v/c)

- 54 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

f' = (f (1 - v/c)1/2)/(1 + v/c)1/2
f' = f ((c - v)/(c + v))1/2  (11)
One finds the term, (1 - v2/c2)1/2, in equation 13,  a  term  that  is  also
found in equations 1 and 2 relating the temporal durations of an occurrence in
inertial reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another.
Where cos    =   /2, equation 13 becomes:

f' = f (1 - v2/c2)1/2  (15)

and the time  dilation  effect  becomes  more  apparent  in  what  is  known  as  the
transverse Doppler effect.  That is, the slower rate of the "moving" clock in W '
by the factor (1  -  v2/c2)1/2  accounts  for  the  difference  in  frequencies  of  the
light pulses emitted by the clock at rest in W for O at rest in W and O'  at rest in
W'.

Where  v  <<  c,  the  factor  (1  -  v2/c2)1/2  is  very  close  to  1  and  time

dilation can be considered a negligible factor in the Doppler effect.  Thus:

f' = (f (1 - v2/c2)1/2)/(1 - (v/c)(cos Q
f' »
f' »

 (f)/(1 - (v/c)(cos Q
 (f)(1 + (v/c)(cos Q

))

))  (16)

))  (13)

Equation 16 takes a form of the non-relativistic Doppler effect.

Consider the following scenario that  is  adapted  from  a  version  of  the
twin  paradox  experiment  proposed  by  Darwin(26)  and  discussed  by
Resnick.(27)  Two spaceships (A and B) are at rest in space far from any large
body.    In  each  spaceship  there  is  an  observer  at  rest.    Each  spaceship  has
identically constructed cesium clocks.  Let  the  spaceships  move  in  a  uniform
translational manner relative to one  another  and  apart  from  one  another.    Let
each cesium clock emit a light pulse after an hour has elapsed according to the
time of the inertial frame in which a clock is at rest.   Then  both  equations  11
and 12 above will hold,  depending on which observer at rest  in  his  reference
frame is measuring the frequency of the light  pulses  emitted  from  the  cesium
clock  at  rest  in  the  other  spaceship.    Allow  that  the  uniform  translational
velocity is 0.8c.  Then equation 11 becomes:

f' = f ((c - 0.8c)/(c + 0.8c))1/2
f' = f ((0.2c)/(1.8c))1/2

- 55 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

f' = (0.111)1/2 f
f' = 0.333 f .

In a similar manner, equation 12 becomes:

f = f' ((c - 0.8c)/(c + 0.8c))1/2 ,

and one can derive that:

f = 0.333 f' .

When an observer in one of the spaceships measures the frequency  of
pulses emitted by the clock at rest in the other spaceship, the frequency of the
pulses will be 0.333 that found by the observer in the other spaceship when this
latter observer measures the frequency of the light pulses emitted by the clock at
rest in his spaceship.  This is what is indicated in Figure 13 over three unit time
periods for observers in both spaceships as measured by clocks at rest in their
respective inertial reference frames.  Thus the observer in spaceship B receives
a  light  pulse  from  spaceship  A  once  every  three  units  of  time  as  time  is
measured in B while A measures the frequency of the light  pulses  emitted  by
the clock at rest in A as one pulse per unit of time.  In a reciprocal manner, the
observer in  spaceship  A  receives  a  light  pulse  from  spaceship  B  once  every
three units of time as time is measured in A while B measures the frequency of
the light pulses emitted by the clock at rest in B as one pulse per unit of time.
The frequency of the light pulses measured by an observer at rest in one of the
spaceships that emanate from the clock at rest in the other spaceship will also be
0.333 the rate of the pulses emitted by the identically constructed clock at rest in
his  own  inertial  reference  frame.    It  is  this  clock  at  rest  in  his  own  inertial
reference frame that the observer uses to determine  the  frequency  of  the  light
pulses from the other clock.

Only a part  of  the  longitudinal  Doppler  effect  is  due  to  time  dilation.
The time dilation  factor  in  equation  13  is  (1  -  v2/c2)1/2  .    Given  a  uniform
translational velocity of 0.8c:

(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = (1 - (0.8c)2/c2))1/2
(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = (1 - (0.64c2)/(c2))1/2
(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = 0.6 .

If  time  dilation  did  not  effect  the  special  relativistic  Doppler  effect  in  the
proposed gedankenexperiment:

f' = (f (1 - v2/c2)1/2)/(1 + v/c)  (14)

f' = f/(1 + (v/c))  (17)
f' = f/(1 + ((0.8c)/(c))
f' = f/1.8
f' = 0.555 f .

Using (1 - v2/c2)1/2 = 0.6 in equation 14, one obtains:

f' = (0.6 f)/(1.8)
f' = 0.333 f .

One can see that the impact of time dilation on the longitudinal Doppler effect in
the gedankenexperiment is significant.

At a uniform relative velocity of 10 km per sec, though, the contribution
of time dilation to the longitudinal Doppler effect would be  difficult,  although
perhaps possible,  to detect.  It is simpler to use  the  transverse  Doppler  effect
(i.e.,  equation 15).    This  way  any  difference  between  the  frequencies  of  the
light  pulses  emitted  by  one  of  the  cesium  clocks  at  rest  in  its  respective
spaceship that are recorded by observers at rest in spaceships A and B would be
due  to  time  dilation.    Instead  of  the  light  pulses  traveling  along  the  axis  of
uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one  another,  the  light  pulses  would
travel orthogonally to this axis in the  reference  frame  in  which  the  clock  that
emitted the light flash is at rest.

With a uniform translational velocity v = 10 x 103 m/sec:
(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = (1 - (10 x 103 m/sec)2/

(2.99792458 x 108 m/sec)2)1/2

(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = (1 - (1.0 x 108 m/sec)/

(8.987551787 x 1016 m/sec))1/2 .

In a binomial expansion to second order:

(1 - v2/c2)1/2 = 1 - 5.563 x 10-10 .

This value is very close to 1.  Nonetheless, the impact of the difference between
this value and 1,  on the order of 10-10,  indicates  that  the  transverse  Doppler
effect in equation 15 is large enough so that the difference in frequencies can be
detected with the use of cesium clocks.

In a suitable arrangement  of  the  spaceships,  observers  at  rest  in  each
spaceship using cesium clocks at rest in their respective spaceships could both

- 58 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

detect  the  transverse  Doppler  effect.    These  observers  would  find  that  the
frequency of the light pulses emitted from the other "moving" spaceship would
be less than the frequency of the light pulses emitted by the cesium clock at rest
in their own spaceship.  Because this transverse Doppler effect would depend
only on time dilation, this result would confirm  that  time  dilation  occurs  in  a
reciprocal  manner  for  observers  at  rest  in  their  respective  inertial  reference
frames.

The distance between the  spaceships  along  the  orthogonal  axis  which
the light pulses travel would need to be large enough to assure that the different
frequencies measured by observers at rest in  their  respective  spaceships  were
indeed  reflecting  only  a  transverse  Doppler  effect,  not  confounded  by  other
wave  effects  (due  to  what  will  be  called  wave  compression/expansion
components).  A large enough distance would allow for enough time between
the change from the blue shift to the red shift as one spaceship passes the other
along an orthogonal to the axis of uniform translational motion relative to  one
another to detect a transverse Doppler effect.

Following is a deduction of the required distance.  Figure  14  presents
one  possible  representation  of  the  experiment  where  the  observer  at  rest  in
spaceship A considers spaceship B to be in uniform translational  motion  with
velocity v relative to spaceship A.  Let the time t = 0 at the instant that spaceship
B lies along an orthogonal axis to the axis of  uniform  translational  motion  of
spaceships A and B relative to one another.  In this case, Q

Conclusion

An exploration of  a  variation  of  the  twin  paradox  leads  to  interesting
results  concerning  the  impact  of  the  argument  concerning  the  relativity  of
simultaneity  in  the  special  theory  on  the  structure  and  functioning  of  the
physical world.   It has been shown  that  the  same  physical  circumstances  can
support the relativity of  simultaneity  being  argued  in  either  of  two  directions
with accompanying distinct sets  of  empirical  results.    The  expression  of  this
argument in the physical world relies upon an observer who considers himself
at rest in an inertial reference frame  and  considers  his  or  her  reference  frame
"stationary,"  or  at  rest.    This  reliance  extends  to  other  results  in  the  special
theory because these other results depend on the relativity of simultaneity.  The
argument  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  also  provides  a  rationale  for  an
observer considering himself at rest in an inertial reference frame,  this  inertial
reference frame in which he is at rest "stationary," and another inertial reference
frame in uniform translational motion relative to him "moving."

including 

the  structure, 

Thus,  in  the  special  theory  there  is  a  role  for  a  cognitive  element
influencing 
the  spatiotemporal  structure,  and
functioning of the physical world.   This conclusion is supported by the freely
made decision noted in the special theory on the part of an individual as regards
the  direction  in  which  to  argue  the  relativity  of  simultaneity.    Because  this
choice is not constrained by any physical factor in the special theory, it is also
itself not reducible to any physical substrate.

In  the  special  theory,  it  is  predicted  that  observers  at  rest  in  their
respective inertial reference frames which they consider to be "stationary," or at
rest, and which are in uniform translational motion  relative to one another, will
find that the clocks at rest in the other observers'  inertial  reference  frame  will
run slower and that they  will  run  slower  by  exactly  the  same  amount.    This
basic prediction of the special theory has not been subjected to the same degree
of empirical scrutiny as the twin paradox or a one-way empirical test, such as
the  m -meson  experiment  discussed.An  interesting  result  concerning  the  light
flashes used in establishing simultaneity in inertial reference frames in uniform
translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  in  a  variation  of  Einstein's  1917
argument  on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  was  pointed  out  that  serves  to
emphasize the consequences in the physical world of the particular direction that

- 62 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

is arbitrarily chosen by an individual in arguing the relativity of simultaneity.

It is proposed that empirical tests in two directions  (i.e.,  with  each  of
the inertial reference frames the "stationary" reference frame in one scenario and
the  reference  frame  not  designated  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  is  the
"moving" reference frame) be  developed  and  conducted.    If  empirical  results
from such tests support  the  predictions  of  the  special  theory,  these  empirical
results would, in addition, support the thesis that there is a cognitive factor in in
the argument on the relativity of simultaneity that affects results derived in the
special theory concerning the structure and functioning of the  physical  world.
It is expected that empirical tests in both directions concerning time dilation will
support the predictions of the special theory.  One such test is proposed.

1It appears Einstein maintained that the observer in the reference frame
that at some point in its motion experienced acceleration would indeed have the
clocks that ran more slowly.  For example, in his original paper on the special
theory, he first demonstrated the phenomenon of time dilation.  He then wrote:

From  this  [time  dilation]  there  ensues  the  following  peculiar
consequence.  If at the  points  A  and  B  of  K  [the  "stationary"
reference frame] there are stationary clocks which, viewed in the
stationary  system,  are  synchronous;  and  if  the  clock  at  A  is
moved with the velocity v along the line  AB  to  B,  then  on  its
arrival at B the two clocks no longer synchronize, but the clock
moved from A to B lags behind the other which has remained at
B by (1/2)tv2/c2 (up to magnitudes of fourth and higher order),
t being the time occupied in the journey from A to B.

It is at once apparent that this  result  still  holds  good  if  the
clock moves from A to B in any polygonal line, and also when
the points A and B coincide.

If we assume that the result proved  for  a  polygonal  line  is
also valid for a continuously curved line, we arrive at this result:
if one of two synchronous clocks A is moved in a closed curve
with constant velocity until it returns to A, the journey lasting t
seconds,  then  by  the  clock  which  has  remained  at  rest  the
travelled clock on its arrival at A will be (1/2)tv2/c2 second [sic]
slow.(28)
In  another  context,  Kopff  quoted  Einstein  from  "The  Relativity
Theory,"  an  article  that  appeared  in  Naturforschende  Gesellschaft,  Zürich,
Vierteljahresschrift, volume 56, and was published in 1911.   Kopff first noted
that:

The consequences deduced from the Lorentz transformation for
the passage of clocks apply naturally to the temporal occurrence
of arbitrary events.  An example which brings out the relations
with great clarity is given by Einstein.(29)
According to Kopff, Einstein wrote the following:

If  we  placed  a  living  organism  in  a  box,  and  made  it  carry
through the same to-and-fro motions as the clocks formerly did,

- 65 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

then  one  could  arrange  that  this  organism,  after  any  arbitrary
lengthy flight, could be returned to its original spot in a scarcely
altered  condition,  while  corresponding  organisms  which  had
remained in their original positions had already long since given
way to new generations.  For the moving organism, the lengthy
time of the journey was a mere instant, provided the motion took
place with approximately the velocity of light.(30)
But the question then arises why did Einstein also maintain that a train
traveling with uniform velocity along an embankment and then experiencing  a
non-uniform motion for a brief period of time,  such  as  the  application  of  the
brakes,  could be considered an inertial reference frame throughout its  motion,
albeit one that experienced a gravitational field at a certain time?  Einstein wrote:

It  is  certainly  true  that  the  observer  in  the  railway  carriage
experiences a jerk forwards as a result of the application of the
brake, and that he recognises in this  non-uniformity  of  motion
(retardation) of the carriage.  But he is compelled by nobody to
refer  this  jerk  to  a  "real"  acceleration  (retardation)  of  the
carriage.  He might also interpret his experience thus: "My body
of  reference  (the  carriage)  remains  permanently  at  rest.    With
reference  to  it,  however,  there  exists  (during  the  period  of
application of the brakes) a gravitational field which is  directed
forwards and which is variable with respect to time.  Under the
influence of this field, the embankment  together  with  the  earth
moves  non-uniformly  in  such  a  manner  that  their  original
velocity 
continuously
in 
reduced."(31)
This idea is the basis for the principle of equivalence, one statement of
which  is  that  inertial  and  non-inertial  reference  frames  are  equivalent  with
regard  to  the  expression  of  physical  law.(32)    In  the  scenario  proposed  by
Einstein,  the  train  is  an  inertial  reference  frame  that  at  some  point  in  time
experiences  a  gravitational  field,  and  this  field  is  associated  with  the
embankment, along with the earth, constituting an accelerating reference frame
relative to an observer at rest on the train.

Holton(33) in "Resource Letter  SRT-1  on  Special  Relativity  Theory,"
wrote that Terrell(34) provided "perhaps the best of the recent reviews" of time
dilation and clock problems.  In his article, Terrell, though arguing that there is
indeed only one twin that will experience time dilation, allowed for the idea that

- 66 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

is the basis for the principle of equivalence, but notes that it is improbable.  In
his version of the twin paradox, Terrell wrote:

An alternative which B [the "moving" observer with the clocks
at rest in his inertial frame] could choose is to apply the general
theory  of  relativity  and  assume  himself 
to  have  been
unaccelerated throughout these events.  He could, because of the
principle  of  equivalence,  account  for  all  observed  effects  by
introducing  moving  gravitational  fields  having  the  nature  of
plane shock  waves,  which  passed  him  coincidentally  with  his
application  of  rocket  power  (or  whatever  produced  his
accelerations as observed by A.)  Thus observer B could assume
himself to have remained stationary while A and the rest of the
universe were accelerated.  However this would be a somewhat
complicated, 
implausible
explanation, although it would agree with the general theory of
relativity  and  would  account 
the  observations
discussed.(35)

coincidental, 

for  all 

and 

physically 

It should be noted that there are some fundamental theoretical problems with the
conventional  solutions  proposed  to  the  twin  paradox.    First,  is  Einstein's
discussion of the railway carriage as the "stationary" frame not implausible?  Is
it substantially less implausible that an observer on a train sees himself as in the
"stationary" frame and the earth as the "moving" frame than Terrell's or anyone
else's  explanation of the twin paradox?  Einstein's  idealized example  is  at  the
heart of the principle of equivalence.  Second, given that the "moving" observer
travels  for  a  much  longer  time  in  an  inertial  reference  frame  relative  to  the
"stationary"  observer  compared  to  the  time  he  spends  in  an  accelerating
reference frame (during the time the "moving" observer is turning around), how
is it that the inertial motion of the "moving" observer over  the  long  period  of
time  gets  set,  so  speak,  as  really  moving  by  the  comparatively  very  brief
acceleration?  As this acceleration sets the "moving" twin as really moving, why
is there no substantial influence on the time dilation effect which is determined
in  the  large  part  by  the  temporal  relations  for  two  inertial  reference  frames
moving in a uniform translational manner relative to one another?

2The essence of the derivation of the Lorentz coordinate transformation
equations is that there is a comparison between: 1) the invariant velocity of light
in all inertial reference frames, and 2) the magnitude of the uniform translational
velocity of two inertial reference frames relative to one another.  One of the two

- 67 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

inertial reference frames in uniform motion relative to one another is designated
the  "stationary"  reference  frame,  and  it  is  from  this  reference  frame  that  the
other  frame  is  considered  "moving"  with  the  uniform  translational  velocity.
This is also the essence of the argument on the relativity of simultaneity, as will
be  shown.    (The  designation  of  the  reference  frame  as  "stationary"  means
essentially  that  simultaneity  is  first  established  in  it  in  the  argument  on  the
relativity  of  simultaneity,  even  though  it  might  be  considered  "stationary"
because  it  is  the  reference  frame  from  which  the  other  reference  frame  is
considered  "moving".    This  is  because  in  Newtonian  mechanics,  built  upon
absolute  simultaneity,  the  designation  of  one  or  the  other  of  two  inertial
reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another  as  the
"stationary" frame does not have the same significance that it does in the special
theory.    For  example,  in  the  kinematics  underlying  Newtonian  mechanics,
spatial lengths of physical existents  and  the  temporal  duration  of  occurrences
are  the  same  in  both  of  the  inertial  frames  regardless  of  which  frame  is
designated  the  "stationary"  reference  frame.    With  regard  to  these  and  other
essential features of  the  physical  world,  in  Newtonian  mechanics  the  role  of
"stationary" and "moving"  reference  frames  can  be  freely  exchanged  without
affecting the results of measurements.  It has been  shown  that  this  is  not  the
case  in  the  special  theory,  and  it  is  the  relativity  of  simultaneity  that  is
responsible for this.   Thus,  the relativity  of  simultaneity  is  indeed  the  key  to
designating an inertial reference frame as "stationary".)

3There is a difference developing the spatial,  as  opposed  to  temporal,
relations  between  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion
relative  to  one  another.    In  spatial  relations,  one  needs  to  simultaneously
determine the ends of whatever is being measured for spatial length in order to
determine this length.  If one knows  the spatial length of an existent at rest in
one  inertial  frame,  one  can  then  follow  the  world  lines  of  the  ends  of  this
existent until they intersect with the time axis of the other inertial frame (which
represents simultaneous spatial positions in this reference frame).  In the case of
temporal relations between these inertial frames, the concern is with measuring
temporal  durations,  that  themselves  are  based  on  simultaneity  in  each  of  the
frames, but which,  of course do  not  require  that  the  beginning  and  end  time
measurements in a frame be  taken  simultaneously  in  that  frame.    Rather,  the
concern is with what time a clock at rest in the "stationary"  frame  will  record
corresponding to a clock at rest in the "moving" frame.

4Einstein noted the reciprocal manner in which space contraction could

- 68 -

On the Arbitrary Choice

be argued.  He wrote:

We envisage a rigid sphere* of radius R,  at rest relatively to the
moving system k [which is moving relative to K,  the stationary
system, along the axis x for K and along the   axis for k],  and
with its centre at the origin of co-ordinates of k....Thus  whereas
the Y and Z dimensions [that is, along the y and z axes in K] do
not appear modified by the motion, the X dimension [that is,  the
x axis in K] appears shortened in the ratio 1: (cid:214) (1 - v2/c2), i.e.,
the greater the value of v the greater the shortening....It  is clear
that  the  same  results  hold  good  of  [sic]  bodies  at  rest  in  the
"stationary"  system  [K],  viewed  from  a  system  in  uniform
motion [k].
* That is, a body possessing spherical form when examined at

rest.(36)

5One can derive equations 7 and 8 from 5 and 6 and vice  versa.    But
these possibilities of derivation do not negate the point that: 1) in the derivation
of  equations  5  and  6  one  of  two  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform
translational  motion  relative  to  one  another  is  designated  the  "stationary"
reference  frame  and  the  other  inertial  reference  frame  is  designated  the
"moving"  reference  frame;  2)  in  the  derivation  of  equations  7  and  8,  that
reference frame designated "moving" in the derivation of equations 5 and 6  is
now  the  "stationary"  reference  frame  and  that  reference  frame  designated
"stationary"  in  the  derivation  of  equations  5  and  6  is  now  the  "moving"
reference frame.  That is, in either derivation, the time of one inertial reference
frame is logically delineated as first, and it is not assumed in the special theory
that the time in the other frame will be the same.  (That is, the assumption is not
made that time is absolute.)  It is found that due to the relativity of simultaneity
for  inertial  reference  frames  in  uniform  translational  motion  relative  to  one
another, the time of one  reference  frame  is  not  the  same  as  that  of  the  other
frame.

In  Newtonian  mechanics, 

relying  on 

the  Galilean  coordinate
transformation, t'  = t so that the  derivation  of  the  designation  of  "stationary"
and  "moving"  inertial  frames 
is
inconsequential.  It is inconsequential for the Galilean coordinate transformation
itself or for the relation between the temporal durations of an event or the spatial
length  of  a  physical  existent  in  the  inertial  reference  frames.    That  is,  in
Newtonian mechanics:

the  analogous  sets  of  equations

and

x' = x - vt  (11)

x = x' + vt' (12)

As noted, the time relation is t' = t.  Thus equation 11 transforms to equation 12
simply in the following way.  From equation 11,

x = x' + vt .

Through substitution from t' = t,

x = x' + vt' .

In  Newtonian  mechanics,  clearly  the  duration  of  an  occurrence  in  the  two
inertial reference frames is  the  same.    And  it  follows  from  the  time  relation,
t' = t, that the length of an object in the two frames is the same.  From  equation
11, it follows that:
D x' = D x - vD
t = 0,

t' = D

As D

Or, using equation 12, one finds in the same manner that:

D x = D x' .
6Another  argument  concerning 

the  dependence  of 

the  Lorentz
coordinate transformation equations on the relativity of simultaneity is presented
below.  It has been shown  how spatial length and temporal duration in inertial
reference frames in uniform translational motion relative to one another depend
on  the  relativity  of  simultaneity.    The  Lorentz  coordinate  transformation
equations  can  be  considered  a  special  case  of  the  equations  expressing
spatiotemporal  relations  between  the  inertial  reference  frames.    One  set  of
spatiotemporal  relations  between 
in  uniform
translational motion relative to one another is given by:

inertial  reference 

frames 

t = D

t'/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (2)

and

D x = D x'(1 - v2/c2)  (4).

Consider the Lorentz coordinate transformation equation:

x' = (x - vt)/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (7).

- 70 -

D
On the Arbitrary Choice

x'  may be said to stand for D x'  in equation 7,  specifically where x1'  = 0  and
x2'  = x'.    Similarly,  x  may  be  said  to  stand  for  D x  in  this  equation,  where
x1 = 0 and x2 = x.  Let t1 be the time coordinate corresponding to x1 and t2 be
the time coordinate corresponding to x2.  If x then does represent  a  length  in
W, t1 = t2.  Then equation 7 becomes:

x = x'(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (11)

or, in more familiar terms,

D x = D x'(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (4).

That it is possible for t1 = t2 = 0 for any values of x1 and x2, or D x, is clear,
for t1, t2, which equal 0, are the time coordinate for the x axis in W.   Equation
11 relates space in W and W' as this equation relates the x axis of W and the x '
axis of W' where W is considered the "stationary" inertial reference frame and
W' is considered the "moving" inertial reference frame.

Similar reasoning can be followed in showing that
t' = [t - (v/c2)x]/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 (8)

can represent a specific form of the relation for time denoted by

t = D

t'/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 (2).

Specifically, let t' represent the difference D
t' between t1' = 0 and t2'  = t'  and t
represent  the  difference  D
t  between  t1  =  0  and  t2  =  t.    x  can  represent  the
difference D x between x1 = 0 and  x2  =  x,  where  x1  is  the  space  coordinate
associated with t1 and x2 is the space coordinate associated with t2.  In deriving
the temporal relation, though, the concern is that the clock is at rest in W'  and
not at rest in W.  That is,  W is the "stationary" frame and W'  is the "moving"
frame in which the clock moving with regard to W is at rest in W'.  (In the case
of spatial length, even though the rod is at rest in W',  nonetheless, in order to
determine the length of the rod in W,  the  ends  of  the  "moving"  rod  must  be
determined in W simultaneously, that is simultaneously in accordance with the
time in W.   This condition is not  applicable  with  regard  to  time.)    Thus,  we
want  x'1  =  x'2,  where  x'1  corresponds  to  x1  and  x'2  corresponds  to  x2.
Then,  considering  the  general  derivation  from  before  concerning  temporal
duration:

t1 = [t1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2] +

[[v/c2][x1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt1]]

- 71 -

D
On the Arbitrary Choice

and

t2 = [t2'(1 - v2/c2)1/2] +

[[v/c2][x1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt2]] .

With these two equations, one can derive:
t2 - t1 = [[t2'(1 - v2/c2)1/2] +

[[v/c2][x1' (1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt2]]] -
[[t1'(1 - v2/c2)1/2] +
[[v/c2][x1' (1 - v2/c2)1/2 + vt1]]]

and finally, with arithmetic:

t2 - t1 = (t2' - t1')/(1 - v2/c2)1/2 .

Since t1 = 0 and t1' = 0:

t = t'/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (12)

or in more familiar terms,

t = D

t'/(1 - v2/c2)1/2  (2).

That it is possible for x1' = x2' = 0 for any values  of  t1'  and  t2',  or  D
t',  is
clear, for x1', x2', which equal 0, are the space coordinate for the t' axis in W'.
Equation 12 relates time in W and W'  as this equation relates the t  axis  of  W
and the t'  axis of W'  where W is considered the "stationary" inertial reference
frame and W' is considered the "moving" inertial reference frame.

7Furthermore, Einstein himself explicitly acknowledged that c -  v  is  a
velocity.  As an example, in deriving the  Lorentz  transformation  equations  in
his  original  paper  on  the  special  theory,  Einstein  discussed  a  "stationary"
inertial  system  K  and  a  "moving"  inertial  system  k  moving  in  a  uniform
translational manner relative to one another.  Concerning a ray of light moving
in the same direction that k is moving relative to K, Einstein(37) wrote:
But the ray [of light] moves relatively to the initial point of k [the
"moving" system], when measured in the stationary system [K],
with the velocity c - v, so that

     x'

D
On the Arbitrary Choice

x' is the distance traveled by the ray of light in K, and t is the time taken in K to
traverse this distance with the velocity c - v.   In another translation of  a  large
section of Einstein's paper, Schwartz(38) translates the textual part of the above
quote from Einstein as:

But,  as measured in the stationary system,  the ray  moves  with
velocity V - v relative to the origin of k, so that we have
x'/(V - v) = t.

V here is the invariant  velocity  of  light  in  all  inertial  reference
frames.

It  might  also  be  argued  that  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  relativity  of
simultaneity, it is only necessary that the observer considered "stationary" (i.e.,
the observer in whose frame simultaneity, or the synchronization of clocks, is
first established in accordance with one of Einstein's  definitions)  be  aware  of
the effective velocities c - v and c  +  v  of  the  lightning  flashes  relative  to  the
"moving" observer (in the case of the train gedankenexperiment,  the  observer
Ot on the train).  If this thesis were correct, there would be an inconsistency in
Einstein's arguments because Einstein did not note explicitly any exceptions to
the  postulate  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity  that  the  velocity  of  light  is
invariant  in  inertial  reference  frames  that  are  in  uniform  translational  motion
relative to one another.

8There is, of course,  the reversal in the direction of the velocity of the
inertial  reference  frames  in  the  two  scenarios  for  arguing  the  relativity  of
simultaneity,  and  there  is  also  the  point  that  the  "moving"  reference  frame
indeed changes spatial coordinates in the "stationary" reference frame over time
of the "stationary" reference frame in both scenarios, and thus has  velocity  in
the "stationary" reference frame.  The change in direction of the velocity of the
inertial reference frames in uniform motion relative to one another is significant
because  it  allows  for  switching  the  inertial  reference  frames  with  regard  to
which  inertial  reference  frame  will  be  the  "moving"  reference  frame  that  is
changing spatial coordinates and time coordinates in the "stationary"  reference
frame and which reference frame will be this "stationary" reference frame.  But
this  change  in  the  direction  of  the  velocity  of  the  inertial  reference  frames
relative  to  one  another  is  significant  with  regard  to  features  of  the  physical
world such as spatial length or temporal duration in the special theory, and not
in Newtonian mechanics and the kinematics underlying it.  It is the relativity of
simultaneity  that  distinguishes  the  special  theory  from  Newtonian  mechanics

and it is the logical distinction, arbitrarily decided, concerning in which inertial
reference frame simultaneity will be established first in the argument that  is  at
the heart of the argument on the relativity of simultaneity.

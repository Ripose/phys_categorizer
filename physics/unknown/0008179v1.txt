Abstract

Quadrupole  electromagnets  have  been  developed
with a hollow coil produced using an improved periodic
reverse electroforming. These will be installed in each of
the drift tubes of the DTL (324 MHz) as part of the JAERI/
KEK Joint Project at the high-intensity proton accelerator
facility.  Measurements  of  the  magnets’  properties  were
found to be consistent with computer-calculated estimated.
The details of the design, the fabrication process, and the
measurement  results  for  the  quadrupole  magnet  are  de-
scribed.

Facility (JHF) started at KEK in 1996[1-3]. Since the op-
erating frequency is much higher (324 MHz) than the con-
ventional frequency (200 MHz), the size of the drift tube
(DT) becomes smaller, resulting in many technical diffi-
culties in fabricating a set of DT and quadrupole magnet
(Q-magnet). Beam dynamics[2] require that the magnets
and the DTs for the low-energy part of the DTL conform to
the following specifications:
1. The magnetic field gradient must be variable.
2. The electromagnet must be installed within the compact
DT (outer diameter within 140 mm, length about 52 mm).
3. The magnet must have a sufficiently large bore diameter
(nearly 16 mm) and a high magnetic field (an integrated
magnetic field gradient is 4.1 Tesla).
4. Expansion of the DT in the beam-axis direction should
be less than 10 m m on one side during operation.
5. The deviation of a quadrupole field center from the me-
chanical center must be within 15 m m.

In order to satisfy the these requirements, the pulsed
electromagnets have been selected, instead of permanent
magnets. However, if we use the conventional hollow con-
ductor type coil, it is very difficult to make an electromag-
net which can be installed within a 324-MHz DT, since the
rather large bending-radius is necessary for the hollow con-

ductors.  Consequently,  we  newly  developed  an
electroformed hollow coil. This new method makes use of
an  advanced  Periodic  Reverse 
(PR)  copper
electroforming[5,6] combined together with various kinds
of  machining  processes  without  welding  (except  for  the
connection to the outside of DT), where the outer surfaces
of the coil consists of an electroformed copper layer.

2 THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
Q-MAGNETS AND THE DTS FOR THE

LOW-ENERGY PART OF THE DTL

The  design  parameters  of  the  Q-magnets  and  the
DTs that we developed for the low-energy part of the DTL
are listed in Table 1.

2.1 Electroformed Hollow Coil

Figure  1  shows  a  detail  of  a  corner  part  of  the
electroformed hollow coil. The coil manufacturing proc-
ess is outlined next. After cutting grooves for the water-
cooling channel in a copper block (Fig. 2a), the grooves
are filled with a wax, which is coated with silver powder to
achieve electronic conductivity (Fig. 2b). A copper layer
of 0.5 mm thickness is formed at each end face by PR cop-
per electroforming (Fig. 2c). After machining the surfaces,
additional copper deposits are formed by 0.5 mm thick-
ness. After  removing  the  wax  and  boring  the  pole-piece
part (Fig. 2d), the coils of the end faces are separated using
an end mill of 0.8 mm in diameter (Fig. 2e). The coils in
the beam-axis direction are then separated to 1.0 mm by a
wire-cutting machine (Fig. 1). In this way, the coil inside
DT is molded without welding. Finally, the magnet leads
are connected to the coils with silver brazing (Fig. 2f).

In order to reduce pressure drops and the effects of
erosion, the water velocity in the coil is limited to under 2
m/s. For the same reason, a bending corner inside the wa-
ter-cooling channel is partly cut. As a result, the measured
pressure drops are 1.8 and 6.3 kg/cm2 for the water flows
of 1 and 2 Liter/minute, respectively.

2.2 Q-Magnet and DT

Some  important  properties  of  the  magnets  were
measured before installing into the DT. Figure 3 shows the
excitation-current dependences of the field gradients. The
measured data are compared with those 3-D analyzed by
MAFIA. Both are in agreement within approximately 2 %.
Furthermore, the higher order multipole components in the
magnetic field center measured by a rotating coil were suf-
ficiently small, being less than 0.11% in comparison with
the quadrupole component (Fig. 4). Also, the field center
was  deviated  only  by  about  4 m m  from  the  mechanical

center.

After installing the magnet into the DT, some prop-
erties were also measured during field excitation. Figure 5
shows the dependence of the water-temperature increase
upon the excitation-current. The temperature increase in
the coil for water-flow rate of 1 liter/minute and the design
excitation-current of 780 A was 3 ˚C, which is within the
specification range. The drift tube was also water-cooled.
However, variations in the flow rate of the DT has no meas-
urable influence on the water-temperature of the coil. This
is probably because the heat load on the coil is not so heavy.
The resonant frequency of the test tank[7] of 1.4 m
was reduced by approximately 220 Hz, when the magnet
was excited at the maximum current (for the design water-
flow rate). This corresponds to an approximately 0.4 m m

3 THE SPECIFICATIONS OF

ALL THE Q-MAGNETS

The specifications of all the Q-magnets in the DTL
are shown in Table 2. Seven kinds of core lengths and five
kinds of bore diameters are chosen in order to make trade-
off between the requirements determined from the beam
dynamics and the reduction in the fabrication cost. The cross
sections of the coils for all the magnets are equal.

 4 CONCLUSION

A  prototype  of  the  quadrupole  electromagnet  for
324-MHz DTL has been successfully made with the full
specifications. The measured characteristics satisfied the
requirements. In conclusion,
1. Quadrupole electromagnets have been developed with a
hollow coil produced using an improved periodic reverse
electroforming.
2. Measured field gradient agreed with the calculated one
within approximately 2 %, and higher-order multipole com-
ponents in the magnetic field center were sufficiently small,
being less than 0.11% in comparison with the quadrupole
component.
3. Since the pressure drop of the prototype coil is only 2
kg/cm2 at the design water-flow rate, the electroformed coil
can be adapted to those for the longer magnets.
4. The temperature increase in the coil at the design water-
flow rate and excitation-current was 3 ˚C, which is within
the specification.
5. The specifications for all the Q-magnets have been de-
termined.

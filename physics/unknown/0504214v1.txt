The Normalization Problem of Special Relativity 

Franz–Günter Winkler1
 

Abstract 

For the special theory of relativity, the normalization problem is formulated as the question how 
observers in constant relative motion may reach an agreement on space and time scales. As the 
normalization problem does not receive a thorough treatment in the standard development of the 
theory,  two  possible  solutions  called  normalization  at  rest  and  normalization  in  motion  are 
suggested.  It  is  shown  that  normalization  in  motion  makes  the  validity  of  the  Lorentz 
transformation  the  result  of  mere  conventions.  The  non-conventional  approach  following  from 
normalization at rest requires an assumption concerning the acceleration of objects. A conceptual 
distinction between inside and outside observation, together with the analysis of the normalization 
problem, allows us to formulate an alternative interpretation of special relativity contrasting both 
the standard interpretation and Lorentz-type interpretations. 

Keywords: interpretation of special relativity, inside versus outside views 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

In  this  paper,  an  investigation  into  the  meaning  of  special  relativity  is  attempted,  which  starts  from  the 
question  how  observers  in  relative  motion  may  achieve  an  agreement  on  their  space  and  time  scales.  As  this 
normalization  problem  does  not  receive  a  thorough  treatment  in  Einstein’s  development  of  the  Lorentz 
transformations, two possible solutions are discussed in the framework of special relativity. They will be called 
normalization at rest and normalization in motion. It will be shown that these solutions are related to different 
interpretations  of  the  Lorentz  transformations.  In  the  case  of  normalization  in  motion,  the  Lorentz 
transformations  can  be  developed  by  the  exclusive  use  of  conventions;  in  fact,  the  relativity  principle  and  the 
principle  of  the  invariance of  the  speed of light  would  play  the  role of mere  conventions for  a  solution  to  the 
normalization problem. Normalization at rest requires an assumption concerning the acceleration of objects. It is 
shown  that  an  adequate  assumption  can  replace  the  relativity  principle  in  the  derivation  of  the  Lorentz 
transformations. 

Neither  normalization  in  motion  nor  normalization  at  rest  seems  to  be  compatible  with  the  standard 
interpretation of special relativity. Therefore, an alternative interpretation of special relativity not only deviating 
from  the  standard  interpretation,  but  also  from  Lorentz-type  interpretations  is  suggested.  It  is  based  on  the 
analysis of the normalization problem and on a conceptual distinction between inside and outside observation. 

2.  THE NORMALIZATION PROBLEM 

To measure means to compare. In hard science, the conditions under which a measurement takes place have 
to be defined very strictly. Most importantly, it has to be assured that the measuring instruments, i.e. the tools 
with  which  the  investigated  phenomena  are  compared,  are  in  a  well-defined  sense  the  same  for  every 
measurement. Only when this is guaranteed to a certain extent, it is justified to relate the measured phenomena to 
each other. 

Out of these basic considerations about the measurement procedure a question arises for the special theory of 
relativity, which deals with measurements stemming from observers in relative motion: By which procedure do 
different  observers  (inertial  frames  of  reference)  assure  that  their  measuring  instruments  are  the  same,  and, 
consequently, in which sense can space and time scales held by different observers be considered the same?

This question will be analyzed as the normalization problem of special relativity. In Einstein’s development 
of  the  relativistic  calculus,  the  normalization  problem  is  not  addressed.  It  is,  though,  a problem  that  has  to  be 
solved  whenever  measurements  stemming  from  different  observers  are  related  to  each  other  as  is  done  in  the 
Lorentz transformations.  

In order to make the role of the normalization problem for the special theory of relativity and the implications 
for its interpretation explicit, two possible solutions to the normalization problem will be discussed, which will 
be called normalization at rest and normalization in motion. 

2.1  Normalization at Rest 

The  most  natural  way  to  solve  the  normalization  problem  is  to  build  two  identical  sets  of  measuring 
instruments (meter sticks and clocks) that rest in a first frame of reference and transfer one of them to a second, 
moving frame. After that the measuring instruments of the second frame can be adapted to the first frame. This 
procedure requires the acceleration of a set of measuring instruments. 

Though avoiding the term acceleration, Einstein seems to have normalization at rest in mind when introducing 
the relativity of lengths.(1) In his scenario, only one meter stick is used, yet in two different (constant) states of 
motion. At  first,  the  meter  stick  and  some  object rest  in  frame  1.  The  length  of  the object  is  measured  by  the 
meter stick. Then the same meter stick and the same object appear as resting in another frame 2 showing some 
constant motion relative to frame 1. Again, a measurement of the object takes place by the use of the meter stick. 
According to the relativity principle, it is postulated that both measurements must yield the same value for the 
length of the object. As a consequence, it turns out that both meter stick and object resting in frame 2 show a 
contraction when being measured in frame 1 (and vice versa).  

In the case of normalization at rest, the space and time scales of different frames are adapted with the help of 
an  accelerated  set  of  measuring  instruments.  By  this,  the  identity  of  the  scales  of  different  frames  is  directly 
given. In the case of normalization in motion, such direct adaptation is impossible. 

2.2  Normalization in Motion 

As normalization at rest is linked to the acceleration of objects, it should not be the choice of the proponents 
of  the  standard  interpretation,  who  regard  length  contraction  and  time  dilation  as  properties  of  space-time  as 
such. As an adequate basis of this view, a different class of normalization procedures can be introduced, which 
will be called normalization in motion. The basic idea of normalization in motion is that two observers aiming at 
an  agreement  on  meters  and  seconds  stay  in  constant  relative  motion  when  performing  the  normalization 
procedure.   

In the following, three versions of normalization in motion are offered, all of which are based on the relativity 
principle. Two observers solving their normalization problem in relative motion choose their scales of space and 
time such that the relativity principle is satisfied. 

2.2.1 Normalization by Postulated Identity (I). It is usually taken as an empirical fact that certain physical 
objects  or  processes  have  identical  spatial  or  temporal  extensions  from  the  view  of  their  rest  frames.  Good 
examples are decay processes of atoms producing radiation of some fixed wavelength. Yet, as long as observers 
in different states of motion performing an experiment have not come to an agreement on meters and seconds, 
this extensional identity can only be a postulate. This postulate, however, could be interpreted as an instruction 
for different observers to solve their normalization problem, namely in the following sense: Every observer has 
to choose the length of his meter stick such that the selected process has the postulated extension. By this, the 
relativity principle is satisfied, as the measured extensions depend exclusively on the relative speed with respect 
to the observer. (The relative speed equals zero in this trivial case.)  

2.2.2 Normalization by the Use of a Moving Object (II). As will be shown in section 3, the normalization 
problem need not be solved in order to allow different observers to perform useful and compatible measurements 
of  velocities.  On  this  basis,  any  two  non-normalized  observers  in  relative  constant  motion  may  arrange  a 
scenario, in which an object moves with some velocity v from the view of the first observer and with the velocity 
–v from the view of the second observer. According to the relativity principle, both observers should measure the 
length  of  the  object  to  the  same  value.  Again,  two  observers  could  take  this  assertion  as  a  basis  for  the 
normalization of their meter sticks. 

2.2.3 Normalization by mutual measurement (III). The minimal construction involves only two observers 
agreeing on their relative motion. Other than procedure (II), which requires a referential object resting in a third 
frame,  procedure  (III)  is  based  on  mutual  measurements  of  meter  sticks  resting  in  the  frames  that  are  to  be

adapted.  The  involved  observers  vary  the  lengths  of  their  (arbitrarily  chosen)  meter  sticks  until  they  measure 
each  other’s  meter  sticks  to  the  same  value.  This  solution,  like  the  previous  one,  presupposes  compatible 
measurements of velocities by non-normalized observers. 

Though  all  three  solutions  to  the  normalization  problem  are  built  upon  the  relativity  principle,  they  are  not 
equivalent  from  a  philosophical  point  of  view.  Solution  (I)  requires  the  assumption  that  there  are  copies  of 
physical  objects  or  processes  which  can  be  treated  the  same  in  different  states  of  motion  by  co-moving 
observers. Solutions (II) and (III) do not make use of copies. The clarification of this difference requires a closer 
look at the relativity principle. 

The relativity principle postulates that the form of the laws of physics is the same in all inertial frames. Using 
the relativity principle as a basis for a solution to the normalization problem - to be precise -  goes beyond that 
meaning, insofar as the form of a law has nothing to do with the scaling of the measured variables.  

How can two observers not yet having solved their normalization problem conclude that they have to do with 
the  same  objects  or  processes  when  performing  some  experiment  in  their  rest  frames?  All  they  can  do  is  to 
compare  the  set  of  relations  between  the  variables  they  measured  in  their  own  experiment  with  the  set  of 
relations between the variables measured by the other observer in his experiment. If the relations are equivalent, 
then  it  is  justified  to  assume  that  the  same  types  of  objects  or  processes  were  involved  in  both  experiments. 
However, it is not legitimate to conclude that also the extensions must be identical. Formal equivalence does not 
imply  equivalence  with  respect  to  scaling.  Only  by  an  act  of  definition,  i.e.  by  setting  the  scales  accordingly 
(normalization procedure (I)), are the extensions of the two objects or processes made identical.  

Normalization in relative motion, irrespective of the chosen procedure, is a legitimate option, as the relativity 
principle is available in the axiomatic system leading to the Lorentz transformations. However, the implications 
for  the  interpretation  of  the  Lorentz  transformations  are  enormous.  If  the  normalization  problem  is  solved  at 
relative rest by the use of accelerated measuring instruments, the validity of the Lorentz transformations is an 
empirical  question:  Is  it  true  that  an  accelerated  meter  stick  shows  the  expected  contraction?  If,  instead,  the 
relativity principle comes  in as a convention for the normalization of measuring instruments resting in inertial 
frames,  the  validity  of  the  Lorentz  transformations  is  tautological.  This  difference  will  be  demonstrated  in  a 
thought experiment in section 6. 

3.  COORDINATE TRANSFORMATIONS FOR NON-NORMALIZED OBSERVERS 

There  are  many  different  ways  to  derive  the  Lorentz  transformations  (e.g.  (2,  3)),  all  of  which  ignore  the 
normalization problem. In the following, a development of the Lorentz transformations is suggested that makes 
the  treatment  of  the  normalization  problem  explicit.  As  a  first  step,  a  set  of  coordinate  transformations  is 
introduced that leaves the normalization problem still open. In section 4 it is shown how normalization in motion 
leads to the Lorentz transformations, in section 5 the same is shown for normalization at rest. 

3.1  Space-Time Frames 

The presented approach to special relativity makes use of a fully Euclidean space-time geometry. The central 
concept of a space-time frame and its relation to measurements of space and time distances can be characterized 
as follows. 

3.1.1  Measurements and space-time frames. On the one hand a space-time frame has to be regarded as a 
geometrical construction on the basis of measurements of space and time distances performed by an observer, on 
the  other  hand  every  space-time  frame  can  be  used  to  describe  the  measurement  processes  performed  by 
observers in relative motion. It is thus possible for every observer holding a frame to reconstruct the frames held 
by observers in relative motion by measuring their measuring processes. 

As a consequence of this, special relativity can be developed from the perspective of any single frame. The 
equivalence of all inertial frames is a logical consequence of the validity of the Lorentz transformations, which 
can be derived in the Euclidean space-time geometry of a single observer. Before this is done, some remarks on 
the following argumentation have to be made. 

For  the  purpose  of  this  paper,  it  is  sufficient  to deal  with only one  space  dimension  in  addition  to  the  time 
dimension.2  The  orthogonality  of  the  space  and  time  axes  is  nothing  more  than  a  convenient  choice  making 
geometrical  relations  and  calculations  easy.  There  is  no  physical  argument  forcing  the  mapping  of  pairs  of 

                                                           
2 Thus, the normalization problem is considered only for meter sticks showing the same spatial orientation. A more complete 
coverage  of  the  normalization  problem  would  comprise  the  adaptation  of  meter  sticks  with  different  spatial  orientations. 
Similar  to  the  normalization  problem  for  moving  meter  sticks  in  one  dimension,  there  is  a  conventional  option,  which  is 
based on the conventional constancy of the speed of light in all directions, and a non-conventional option, which is based on 
the rotation of a meter stick.

measured space and time distances between events to a rectangular geometry. In the diagrams, the time axis is 
scaled with the constant c (speed of light), which makes light rays appear as 45° lines.  

Fig. 1. A resting light clock consisting of two mirrors between which two light rays are reflected. The light 
rays meet in the middle point M. Events A and B respectively C and D are simultaneous. 

In figure 1 the concept of a light clock is introduced in the framework of an observer, for whom the invariance 
of the speed of light is assumed. In addition to Einstein’s light clock a second light ray is reflected between two 
mirrors, which are fastened at the end points of a stick. The light rays are synchronized such that they always 
meet in the middle point M of the stick. By this, Einstein’s definition of synchrony holds for events A and B as 
well as for events C and D. 

While figure 1 shows a resting light clock, the light clock of figure 2 is in motion along the x-axis. For the 
moving clock, the events A’ and B’ as well as the events C’ and D’ are synchronous. The associated space and 
time axes of the moving clock show an angle γ relative to the axes of the rest frame.

The  clocks  in  figure  1  and  figure  2  represent  inertial  observers  holding  their  own  space-time  frames.  The 
parallelograms ABCD respectively A’B’C’D’ can be regarded as the elementary cells of these frames, which hold 
space-time  coordinates  for  all  possible  events,  including  all  events  belonging  to  the  measurement  procedures 
performed by different observers. 

The  assumption  that  light  has  an  invariant speed  for both  observers  can  very  easily  be  implemented  by  the 

following convention.3

                                                           
3  Note  that  the  assumption  of  the  invariance  of  the  speed  of  light  (for  all  inertial  observers)  presupposes  a  solution  to  the 
normalization problem. As long as the normalization problem is not solved, the invariance of the speed of light cannot be an 
empirical fact, but only a convention.

3.1.2    Conventional  invariance  of  the  speed  of  light.  In  order  to  make  the  speed  of  light  invariant  in  all 
inertial frames, each observer takes the arbitrarily chosen length of his light clock to be 1 meter and the temporal 
interval between two reflections (“ticks”) as 1 second divided by c. If all observers do so, the speed of light is 
fixed to c. From now on, it is assumed that for all inertial observers – by this convention – the speed of light is c. 

Before  showing  how  frames  can  be  mapped  to  each  other,  the  mutual  measurements  of  two  observers  are 
illustrated by the use of the light clocks that represent their frames. Figure 3 shows two observers (light clocks) 
in relative motion who take the length of their own stick to be 1 meter. The simultaneous measurement of the 
other observer’s stick marks a Euclidean space-time distance that is compared to the meter stick of the observer 
performing  the  measurement.  For  S’  the  length  of  S  is  x’  divided  by  1  meter(S’).  For  S  the  length  of  S’  is  x 
divided by 1 meter(S).  

Fig. 3. Two observers measure each other’s lengths simultaneously from their own point of view. 

3.2  Derivation of the Transformations for Space and Time Distances 

The transformations of space and time distances held by a resting frame S to a frame S’ moving with velocity 

v can be derived using figure 4.

Fig. 4. The coordinates of event P are measured in the resting frame S and in the frame S’ which moves with 
velocity v relative to S. Both coordinate systems are assumed to have the same origin O. The similarity of the 
triangles ABP and CDP allows to formulate the transformations for space and time distances from frame S to 
frame S’.  

The two non-normalized frames in figure 4 have a common origin in event O. In both frames the space and 
time  coordinates  of  event  P  are  measured.  The  diagram  shows  the  perspective  of  frame S,  whose  time  axis  is 
scaled with c. However, the following arguments hold for the perspective of any inertial observer. As has already 
been shown in figure 2, in such illustrations the space and time axes of frame S’ have the same angle relative to 
the axis of the resting frame S. From this it follows that the triangles ABP and CDP are similar, which allows to 
formulate the following relation. 

 

The term N plays a key role for the normalization problem; therefore it will be called normalization term. As a 

consequence of  (1), the transformations for space and time distances from frame S to frame S’ take the form:

                                                           (2) 

 The normalization term N is responsible for the scaling of the resulting space and time distances in S’. For 
each choice of the length of the meter stick in S’ there is a corresponding value for Ν. It will be shown that the 
selection of a value for the normalization term N of a set of transformations T (S=>S’) determines the value N-1 
of the inverse transformations T-1(S’=>S). 

Before clarifying the relation between N and N-1, three important properties of the transformations between in 

general not normalized observers have to be listed:  

(a)  There  is  one  signal  whose  speed  is  invariant  for  all  observers.  This  is  already  given  by  the  way  the 
space-time frames of inertial observers are constructed. For this construction, the invariance of the speed of light 
is a mere convention. In section 6, the assumption of an invariant signal other than light will be discussed. 

(b) Two observers agree on their relative velocity. The validity of this statement can easily be demonstrated 
by describing the world line of a point resting in frame S and by transferring it to the frame S’, which moves 
relative to S with speed v.

Independent of the (non-zero) value of Ν, the speed of the frame S from the view of S’ is –v. 

(c)  The  relativistic  addition  theorem  for  velocities  holds.  The  derivation  of  the  addition  theorem  for 
velocities is essentially the same as when using the Lorentz transformations. In inertial frame S a point moves 
with  constant  speed  v1.  The  coordinates  of  that  point  are  described  from  the  view  of  a  system  S’  that  moves 
relative to S with speed –v2. After that, the speed v of the point from the view of S’ is calculated.

Also  in  this  calculation,  the  value  of Ν  is  irrelevant  for  the  resulting  velocity  v.  Once  more  it  should  be 
stressed that the statements (b) and (c) concerning velocities do not depend on a solution to the normalization 
problem. They also do not depend on the relativity principle. In the suggested Euclidean space-time geometry, 
they are derived from the definition of the measurement procedures (including the definition of synchrony) and 
the convention of the invariance of the speed of light.

3.3  The relation between two normalization terms 

For  the  transformations  T(S=>S’)  and  for  the  inverse  transformations  T-1(S’=>S)  between  two  frames  in 
relative motion, a change of the length of a meter stick in one frame always has an effect on both normalization 
terms.  The  relation  between  N  and  N-1  can  be  calculated  by  assuming  that  a  space-time  interval  as  being 
measured  by  frame  S  is  mapped  to  itself  when  first  being  transformed  to  frame  S’  and  afterwards  being  re-
transformed to frame S.

As a consequence of both normalization in motion and normalization at rest, the values for N and N-1 will be 
shown  to  be  equal,  which  leads  to  the  Lorentz  transformations.  However,  different  and  as  well  consistent4 
choices  for  N  and  N-1  are  possible.  E.g.,  a  scenario  can  be  imagined,  in  which  all  frames S’  adapt  their  meter 
sticks such that the meter stick of a selected frame S is measured by them to 1 meter. Accordingly, the frames S’ 
would measure also time intervals to the same values as frame S. Applying (2) and (5) leads to the normalization 
terms for this scenario.

4.  NORMALIZATION BY THE RELATIVITY PRINCIPLE 

The transformations T describe the mapping of space and time distances between inertial frames that have not 
solved  their  normalization  problem,  i.e.  the  lengths  of  the  meter  sticks  have  been  chosen  independently.  The 
term Ν is responsible for the scaling of both space and time distances in S’. Procedures that fix the terms Ν and 
N-1 for the transformations between two frames and consequently the lengths of the observers’ meter sticks are 
normalization procedures. One such normalization procedure follows from the relativity principle, saying: “Two 
inertial observers choose the lengths of their meter sticks such that they measure each other’s meter stick to the 
same  value.”  This  normalization  procedure  has  already  been  introduced  as  normalization  by  mutual 
measurement (III). In order to make the velocity of light equal c also after the normalization, the time scales have 
to be re-adapted according to section 3.1.2. 

In the following calculation of the normalization terms for the transformations between two frames S and S’, 
the length of the meter stick of frame S as measured by frame S’ is regarded as the result of the transformation of 
the space-time interval, which describes the length measurement of the meter stick of S performed by S’, from S 
to S’.

4  The  consistency  of  such  alternatives  is  limited  to  1-dimensional  space.  The  integration  of  a  second  or  third  spatial 
dimension is not compatible with the constancy of the speed of light for all spatial directions.

Inserting this expression for Ν to the formulae of the transformations T leads to the Lorentz transformations. 
This  step  completes  a  derivation  of  the  Lorentz  transformations  which  solves  the  normalization  problem  in 
relative motion by the use of the relativity principle.  

However, this solution has a disadvantage which is connected to the interpretation of special relativity: Length 
contraction and time dilation are mere consequences of conventions, namely the constancy of the speed of light 
and the relativity principle, which stand behind normalization in motion. There is no possibility to conclude from 
this that an object which at first rests in one frame and then accelerates until it rests in the other frame shows the 
relativistic length contraction. Yet, this statement is part of the interpretation of special relativity as it stands. 

In order to provide the full meaning of length contraction, an assumption on acceleration is inescapable and - 

as will be shown - sufficient.  

5.  NORMALIZATION BY AN ASSUMPTION ON ACCELERATION 

Solving  the  normalization  problem  at  rest  requires  an  assumption  on  acceleration.  In  this  section,  an 
assumption is formulated which is motivated by Einstein’s treatment of length contraction. The approach will be 
discussed in section 5.3. 

5.1  Identity and Acceleration 

The scenario in which Einstein introduces the contraction of lengths (1) consists of two measurements yielding 
the same value for the length of an object: At first, the object and the meter stick rest in some inertial frame, after 
that, both the meter stick and the measured object are in the same state of constant motion relative to the original 
rest  frame.  The  identity  of  the  measured  lengths  might  be  explained  by  a  simple  assumption  on  acceleration, 
which is not made explicit by Einstein, though. 

Hidden  Assumption  on  Accelerating  Objects.  Accelerating  objects  stay  identical  from  their  own 

perspective.  

In  order  to  make  this  assumption  exploitable  for  mathematical  analysis,  the  perspective  of  the  accelerating 

object has to be defined. This can be done by the use of tangent frames.5  

Tangent  Frame.  A  tangent  frame  is  an  inertial  frame  from  whose  perspective  a  continuously  accelerating 

object rests for a point in time.  

In the infinitesimal limit, the velocities shortly before and shortly after this point in time take the same value 
for the tangent frame, differing only in direction.6 It is therefore possible to regard the tangent frame as a kind of 

                                                           
5 The concept of a tangent frame has been introduced by Einstein (4) and is common in general relativity. 
6 This holds whenever the second derivative of the object’s world line exists.

reflector  for  accelerating  objects.  Each  continuous  acceleration  can  be  constructed  from  an  infinity  of 
infinitesimally small reflections or “sudden changes”.  

Once the perspective of the accelerating object is defined as the perspective of the actual tangent frame, an 

assumption on acceleration can be formulated that supports Einstein’s hidden assumption.  

Assumption of Simultaneous Change. A change of the velocity of an object takes place simultaneously for 

the object. 

On the basis of this assumption it will be shown in section 5.2 that any discrete sudden change of the velocity 
of  an  object  leads  to  the  Lorentz  contraction  and  consequently  to  the  relativistic  normalization  term  N.  The 
validity of this also for the limiting case of continuous acceleration is a mathematical consequence.  

5.2  Derivation of the Normalization Term by the Assumption of 

The  assumption  of  simultaneous  change  allows  to  derive  the  normalization  term Ν  and  thereby  solves  the

Fig. 5.  The distance l1 between two resting points changes to l2, when they “suddenly” accelerate to the same 
velocity, but at different points in time. The events E and E’ are simultaneous for the tangent frame, whose 
space axis shows an angle ϕ relative to the resting frame’s space axis. The time axis of the points after the 
sudden change show an angle γ relative to the time axis of the resting frame. 

Figure 5 shows the world lines of two resting points that suddenly change their velocity to v. They do so at 
events E and E’ which are simultaneous from the view of some tangent frame moving with speed vT. Equations

The fact that vT is the velocity of the tangent frame can be expressed by applying the addition theorem, which 

has already been derived for the transformations T between non-normalized inertial frames (4).

5.3  Discussion of the Assumption of Simultaneous Change 

The assumption of simultaneous change leads to an accelerating behavior of extended physical objects which 
is  known  as  Fermi-Walker  transport.(5)  It  is  connected  with  the  concepts  rigid  object  and  rigid  motion  of 
objects.(6) Other than in the literature, where rigid motion is introduced by infinitesimal Lorentz transformations, 
it has been shown in this section that rigid motion, as an implementation of normalization at rest, allows a non-
conventional derivation of the Lorentz transformations. 

Building the Lorentz transformations upon the assumption of rigid objects creates a strange situation: Rigidity 
is  not  compatible  with  special  relativity’s  limitation  of  physical  effects  to  the  speed  of  light.  A  rigid  objects 
reacts “as a whole” when being accelerated, whereas from a classical, atomistic point of view such behavior is 
forbidden. 

The non-rigid acceleration of physical objects produces tensions,(6) which means that spatial relations between 
parts of the object, as being measured by the tangent frame, undergo changes. However, this does not imply that 
the  relativistic  length  relations  do  not  hold  after  an  object’s  acceleration.  It  could  very  well  be  the  case  that 
objects  have  the  ability  to  restore  the  correct  relativistic  lengths  after  the  tensions  have  come  to  an  end.  This 
would  not  only  require  that  the  object  “memorizes”  the  spatial  relations  between  its  parts.  It  would  also  be 
necessary that the correct relativistic length is kept by at least one part, to which the lengths of all other parts 
could be re-adapted. As a consequence, rigidity has to be postulated at least for parts of physical objects in order 
to support normalization at rest and thereby the non-conventional meaning of length contraction. 

As classical physics does not allow rigidity, it seems natural to seek rigidity and consequently a foundation of 
special  relativity  in  the  domain  of  quantum  mechanics.  The  existence  of  non-local  phenomena(7)  as  being 
postulated by quantum mechanics might provide an appropriate basis for this undertaking. 

6.  THE ROLE OF THE INVARIANT SIGNALING SPEED 

The  speed  of  light  plays  a  key  role  for  the  conservation  of  an  object’s  identity  trough  a  process  of 
acceleration: It is the simultaneity on the basis of the speed of light which brings forth the right contraction term 
of the Lorentz transformations. Thereby the definition of synchrony, the invariance of the speed of light, and the 
relativity principle loose their conventional character. 

In the following, it will be shown that the conventional invariance of a speed different from that of light as the 
basis for the Lorentz transformations is in principle possible. The calculus works perfectly and does not lead to 
contradictions (e.g. time paradoxes). However, there are strong consequences for the description of acceleration 
and length contraction, as well as for scenarios involving signals that are faster than the chosen invariant signal. 

6.1  Special Relativity in a Medium 

As a thought experiment, the space-time frames of observers moving in a medium are analyzed who use the 

speed of sound waves in the medium (c1) instead of light in the vacuum.8

Sound  observers  use  sound  clocks  instead  of  light  clocks.  The  space-time  frames  of  sound  observers  are 

constructed in the same way as has been done for light observers: Constantly moving sound observers  

                                                           
8 The discussion of a relativity theory based on a different invariant signal than light is inspired by Svozil (8).

the form:9

choose rods of arbitrary lengths as their meter sticks and define the time between two ticks of their sound 
clocks as one second divided by c1, 
adapt  their  meter  sticks  such  that  they  measure  each  others  meter  sticks  to  the  same  value  (i.e.  perform 
normalization procedure (III)), and  
re-adapt their time scales such that the speed of sound, again, equals c1. 

From the same arguments as in sections 3 and 4 it follows that the transformations between two frames take

As a consequence of these formulae, the motion of an observer relative to the medium cannot be read from the 
space-time measurements based on sound. However, when the readings of co-moving clocks based on different 
signaling velocities (sound and light) are compared, a difference appears which depends on the motion relative to 
the medium.

Fig.  6.  From  the  rest  frame  of  the  medium,  the  space-time  cells  of  a  sound  clock  C1  and  a  light  clock  C2 
moving  at  the  same  speed  are  illustrated.  Observers  using  different  clocks  disagree  on  which  events  are 
simultaneous. 

Figure 6 shows two such observers and their differing views of space and time. The observers no longer agree 
on which spatially separated events are simultaneous. From the view of the rest frame of the medium, the space 
axis of the sound observer is steeper than the space axis of the light observer. If, instead, both observers were at 
rest relative to the medium, their space axes would be identical. 

More  serious  problems  arise  when  objects  are  accelerated.  The  contraction  terms  of  ordinary  (light  based) 
special relativity and of sound based special relativity result in different values. The fact that the sound based 
contraction  term  will  not  stand  experimental  tests  shows  the  mere  conventional  character  of  sound  relativity. 
Despite these shortcomings, there are no causal problems for sound relativity. Contrasting Svozil’s approach,(7) it 
will be shown that the use of light signals does not lead to time paradoxes for sound observers. 

6.2  Faster-than-Sound Communication 

The following example shows the extreme case of faster-than-sound communication, namely when a signal is 
used that is “faster than the space axis” of a moving sound frame. In figure 7 two co-moving sound observers 
exchange light signals. Observer O1 sends a light signal in the direction of observer O2 at event A. The signal is 
received by O2 at event B’ and immediately answered by a signal directed at O1. This signal is received by O1 at 
event C. For the observers O1 and O2, the events A and A’, B and B’ as well as C and C’ are synchronous. 

As can be read from the diagram, the two observers agree on the following statements. 

                                                           
9 The relative velocity of the frames is limited to c1. 

 

 

•  The first signal moves backward in time and is received before its emission.    (A > B’) 

•  The second signal moves forward in time and is received after its emission.     (C > B’) 

Although it is possible to send signals “backward in time” in one direction, it is impossible to construct causal 

paradoxes: No event can ever depend causally on a later event at the same location (A < C).10

Fig.  7.  Two  sound-observers  holding  synchronized  clocks  are  moving  through  the  medium.  Observer  O1 
sends a light signal at event A to observer O2. The signal is received at event B’ and immediately answered 
by  another  light  signal  which  is  received  by  observer  O1  at  event  C.  In  one  direction,  a  light  signal  can 
destroy  the  temporal  order  between    emission  and  reception  (A  >  B),  but  not  in  both  directions  (B  <  C). 
Events taking place in one point in space cannot lose their temporal order (A < C). This means that causal 
paradoxes are not possible. 

7.  THE INTERPRETATION OF SPECIAL RELATIVITY 

The  analysis  of  the  normalization  problem  results  in  a  dilemma  for  the  standard  interpretation  of  special 
relativity:  Either  the  validity  of  the  Lorentz  transformations  is  a  product  of  mere  conventions  and  therefore 
empirically meaningless, or an assumption concerning the acceleration of objects is required. In the following, 
an  alternative  interpretation  of  special  relativity  will  be  presented  that  not  only  contrasts  the  standard 
interpretation but also Lorentz-type interpretations.(3, 10, 11)

7.1  Standard Versus Lorentz-type Interpretations  

The standard interpretation concentrates on Minkowski’s geometrical picture, in which a unified space-time 
plays an ontological role. The invariance of the vacuum speed of light for any inertial observer is a property of 
space-time as such and is not due to any effects concerning the measuring instruments. Length contraction and 
time dilation are merely perspective – relative motion does not make a real difference between objects. 

For defenders of a Lorentzian view, there is a twofold ontology concerning space and time. There exists an 
absolute frame, from whose perspective the substantial medium called ether is at rest, and an absolute flow of 
time. The invariance of the speed of light is valid only for the ether’s rest frame and merely apparent for moving 
frames. Length contraction and time dilation, which depend on motion relative to the ether, are real phenomena 
with respect to the rest frame. The reciprocity of these effects, i.e. the fact that for the really contracted observer 
the resting observer also appears to be contracted, is due to the real contraction of the moving meter stick and to 
asynchronous measurements (according to Einstein’s definition) performed by the moving observer. 

As both interpretations make the same experimental predictions, the choice between them can only be based 
upon  considerations  external  to  the  domain  of  special  relativity.  The  main  argument  for  adopting  the  standard 
interpretation is the fact that the assumption of an absolute rest frame is unnecessary for the development of the 
theory. Lorentz-type interpretations claim that they allow a classical understanding of special relativity by saving 
the medium for electromagnetic waves and the intuitive concept of an independent time dimension. 

Although  the  two  interpretations  are  significantly  different,  they  can  be  attacked  for  the  same  weakness, 
namely  for  the  secondary  treatment  of  the  normalization  problem  and  consequently  for  ignoring  the  role  of 
acceleration for special relativity.  

                                                           
10 The example could be used in the discussion around hypothetical tachyons (9) Sound observers detecting light signals are in 
a similar situation as physicists would be when detecting faster-than-light signaling via tachyons.

7.2  An Alternative Interpretation 

It  has  been  argued  that  a  clear  treatment  of  the  normalization  problem  makes  it  necessary  to  deal  with 
acceleration. Otherwise the normalization of measuring instruments already presupposes the relativity principle 
and  reduces  to  a  mere  convention  leaving  no  empirical  content  for  the  Lorentz  transformations.  If,  however, 
special  relativity  is  built  upon  an  assumption  on  acceleration,  a  different  kind  of  interpretation  of  special 
relativity becomes possible.  

7.2.2  How to Derive the Lorentz Transformations 

The interpretation of a theory is closely linked to its derivation. According to the suggested interpretation the 

Lorentz transformations should be developed in a Euclidean space-time geometry by the following steps:  

•  Definition of the measurement procedures according to Einstein. 

•  The assumption that the vacuum speed of light is invariant for one frame, independent of the speed of the 

source. 

•  The assumption that (ideal) objects accelerate simultaneously from their own point of view (which is 

equivalent to the assumption that accelerated objects show the Lorentz contraction).  

In  this  derivation,  the  relativity  principle  is  missing.  However,  as  a  consequence  of  the  Lorentz 
transformations the relativity principle gets a much stronger status. Unlike in the standard derivation, where the 
relativity principle boils down to a mere convention for the normalization of measuring instruments, it receives 
an empirical value in the alternative interpretation.  

As has already been pointed out in section 5.4, the assumption of simultaneous change requires non-classical 
properties of matter. Therefore, quantum mechanics could become the basis for special relativity. For defenders 
of  a  Lorentzian  view  the  possibility  of  simultaneous  effects  may  seem  attractive,  as  it  might  turn  out  that 
quantum mechanical effects are absolutely simultaneous, which would mark the rest frame of the ether.11 This 
idea,  however,  is  not  supported  by  the  proposed  interpretation.  The  suggested  simultaneity  of  acceleration 
depends on the motion state of the accelerating object and is not at all absolute. If  acceleration was synchronized 
according to some absolute synchrony, the Lorentz contraction for accelerated objects would not hold in general.   

7.2.3  Inside Versus Outside Observation 

Both the standard interpretation and Lorentz-type interpretations make ontological claims. Before scheduling 
the  alternative  position  in  this  question,  a  simple  understanding  of  ontology  is  suggested  which  is  based  on  a 
distinction between two types of observation.   

In the final analysis, every physical observation is an inside operation in the sense that it is performed by an 
observer  who  is  part  of  the  universe.  The  measurement  procedure  is  a  physical  process  with  two  physical 
participants, namely the observer and the thing observed.12 The result of every measurement has to be regarded 
as a product of a physical process involving both observer and thing observed and cannot be taken to capture a 
property of the observed thing as such. 

From  this  fundamental  argument  it  follows  that  a  detached,  outside  observer  position  can  only  be  a 
construction.  This,  of  course,  does  not  imply  that  dealing  with  outside  conceptions  is  useless.  It  should  be 
regarded  as  the  very  nature  of  human  cognitive  activity  (including  science)  to  construct  outside  models. 
Whatever else might be meant by ontology, it should contain the idea of properties that would be “visible” from 
a hypothetical outside observer position. 

The  alternative  interpretation  is  aiming  at  a  pair  of  inside  and  outside  views  fitting  together  in  a  way  that 
makes clear how the outside view is constructed from the inside view and how the inside view can be explained 
from the outside view.13  

The conceptual difference between the two types of observation can easily be applied to the measurements of 
space  and  time  in  special  relativity.  Thereby  the  distinction  between  inside  and  outside  models  is  given  a 
geometrical  meaning. The outside view that is suggested as a basis for the alternative interpretation of special 
relativity  is  a  4-dimensional  and  fully  Euclidean  geometry.  The  diagrams  presented  in  this  paper  are  to  be 
understood as 2-dimensional projections of this geometry. The outside view is comparable to the reader’s view 

                                                           
11 K. Popper(12) suggested to analyze the synchrony of quantum-mechanical effects as a possible test between standard and 
Lorentz interpretations of special relativity. 
12 More careful analysis, especially in the light of quantum theory, makes even the distinction between observer and thing 
observed appear as a result of an operation.(13)  
13 The distinction between inside and outside observation, which was introduced by the author more broadly in the context of 
cognitive science,(14) is in good accordance with Svozil’s distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic observation.(15)

of the given illustrations. The reader may rotate the sheets of paper and check the diagrams from different sides. 
This, of course, does not relate to a physical process, because the outside observer is not part of what is being 
illustrated and does not undergo any changes (e.g. the reader’s ruler stays the same).  

Inside  observers  cannot  be  regarded  as  detached  or  unaffected  when  they  change  their  space-time  angle  of 
observation, as their meter sticks and clocks do not stay the same. It is the inside observer transformation that is 
described by the Lorentz transformations. The Minkowski space-time geometry, which captures measurements 
stemming from inside observers, can in principle not take an ontological status in the above defined sense.  

The  4-dimensional  Euclidean  world  of  the  alternative  interpretation  also  contrasts  the  twofold  ontology  of 
Lorentz-type interpretations consisting of a 3-dimensional space and a 1-dimensional time. From the constructed 
outside view there is one frame whose space and time axes appear as orthogonal lines, yet this frame should not 
be regarded as the absolute rest frame as is done by the Lorentz interpretation. Notions like space, time, motion 
or rest are – in the last consequence - meaningless for the outside observer and have to be understood as mere 
inside  observer  categories.  The  outside  picture  is  completely  static  and  leaves  no  room  for  an  independent, 
dynamical time dimension.  

From the alternative perspective, the key for a deeper understanding of relativity has to be sought in the nature 
of the physical object and its relation to the 4-dimensional whole. The existence of the physical object seems to 
be bound to two types of connections. On one hand the object maintains itself through time, on the other hand, as 
has been suggested, the spatially separated parts of the object must be coordinated simultaneously through space. 
The alternative interpretation - aiming at the construction of a consistent outside view - requires the analysis of 
these – from the inside - very different connections on a common ground.14  

In  some  sense  the  alternative  interpretation  is  more  radical  than  both  established  interpretations.  More 
explicitly  than  in  the  Lorentz  interpretation,  the  understanding  of  special  relativity  is  based  on  a  constructed 
outside  view.  From  this  outside  view,  however,  the  integration  of  space  and  time  into  an  inseparable  whole 
reaches even further than in the standard interpretation, where space and time still receive a different treatment.    

8.  CONCLUSIONS 

In the current physical debate, the question how to interpret special relativity is not taken very seriously. It is 
even hardly  known  that  alternatives  to  the  standard  view  in  the  form  of  Lorentz-type  interpretations  exist  and 
that they are as well consistent. A major objective of this contribution is to underline that the interpretation of 
special relativity is an important and still open issue.  

As  an  elementary  argument  about  the  normalization  problem  shows,  there  is  a  dilemma  for  the  standard 
interpretation of special relativity.  Either the Lorentz transformations are a mere product of conventions with no 
empirical  content,  or  an  assumption  on  acceleration  is  required,  which  deeply  contradicts  the  spirit  of  the 
standard  interpretation.  The  chosen  assumption  on  acceleration  can  fully  replace  the  relativity  principle  in  the 
derivation  of  the  Lorentz  transformations.  By  explicitly  presupposing  non-local  properties  of  matter,  the 
presented approach suggests a foundation of special relativity in quantum mechanics. 

The  outlined  interpretation  of  special  relativity  following  from  the  treatment  of  the  normalization  problem 
contrasts  both  the  standard  interpretation  and  Lorentz-type  interpretations.  The  differences  are  based  on  a 
distinction  between  inside  and  outside  views.  From  the  constructed  outside  view,  the  geometry  of  special 
relativity is 4-dimensional and fully Euclidean.

Abstract

The metric structure of homogeneous spaces of rank-one and rank-two
associated to the real pseudo-orthogonal groups SO(p, q) and some of their
contractions (e.g., ISO(p, q), Newton–Hooke type groups. . . ) is studied. All
these spaces are described from a uniﬁed setting following a Cayley–Klein
scheme allowing to simultaneously study the main features of their Rieman-
nian, pesudoRiemannian and semiRiemannian metrics, as well as of their cur-
vatures. Some of the rank-one spaces are naturally interpreted as spacetime
models. Likewise, the same natural interpretation for rank-two spaces is as
spaces of lines in rank-one spaces; through this relation these rank-two spaces
give rise to homogeneous phase space models. The main features of the phase
spaces for homogeneous spacetimes are analysed.

1 Introduction

The main aspect usually considered when working on a phase space is its associated
symplectic structure. However homogeneous phase spaces, i.e., those admitting a
structure preserving a Lie group of transformations have a richer structure, which
can be overlooked if attention is focused only on their symplectic structure. Ac-
tually, homogeneous phase spaces have also a canonical connection and a metric
structure, with a ‘main’ Riemannian metric (which can be as well pseudoRieman-
nian or degenerate Riemannian). In some cases, the phase spaces have also invariant
foliations, with a subsidiary metric deﬁned in each leaf.

The aim of this paper is to provide a complete characterization of the quadratic
metric in a set of phase spaces which are constructed as symmetrical homogeneous
spaces coming from the orthogonal Cayley–Klein (CK) groups [1, 2]. This family
of real Lie groups, called ‘quasi-orthogonal’ [3] are exactly the family of motion
groups of the geometries of a real space with a projective metric [4, 5]. They include
the semisimple pseudo-orthogonal groups of the Cartan series Bl, Dl as well as
many others which are non-semisimple and that can be obtained by contraction
processes from the formers (e.g., Euclidean, Poincar´e, Galilean, Newton–Hooke type
groups. . . ). All groups in this family share many important properties allowing
their study to be done at once. Furthermore, the kinematical groups associated to
diﬀerent homogeneous models of spacetime [6] belong to this family, and this fact
indeed provides one of the strongest physical motivations to study them.

We ﬁrst introduce in Section 2 the family of orthogonal CK groups from an
‘abstract’ point of view. In Section 3 we focus on the set of rank-one homogeneous
spaces associated to this family, and we describe in detail how the metric(s) in these
spaces comes from the Killing–Cartan form. Physically, all homogeneous models of
spacetime are rank-one spaces. In Section 4 we carry out a similar study for the rank-
two spaces; this is also physically meaningful, because homogeneous phase spaces
are rank-two spaces. The last Section is devoted to commenting upon the physical
meaning of properties of the homogeneous phase spaces, which are presented against
the bakground provided by the more familiar properties of spacetime models.

2 Symmetrical homogeneous CK spaces

The orthogonal CK algebras are real Lie algebras of dimension N(N + 1)/2 whose
generators are Ωab with a, b = 0, 1, . . . , N and a < b. This family can be described
collectively by means of N real coeﬃcients ω1, . . . , ωN . The non-zero Lie brackets
are (no sum over repeated indices):

[Ωab, Ωac] = ωabΩbc

[Ωab, Ωbc] =

Ωac

[Ωac, Ωbc] = ωbcΩab

with a < b < c, and where the coeﬃcients with two indices are deﬁned by

Each coeﬃcient ωa can be scaled to the values +1, 0,

1, thus the family
SOω1,...,ωN (N + 1) essentially comprises 3N Lie groups; we remark that a value of
any coeﬃcient ωa equal to zero is equivalent to a contraction limit. The properties
of groups in the CK family depend mainly on whether the values of the coeﬃcients
ωa in the sequence (ω1, . . . , ωN ) are equal to zero or not. The essential properties
are [1]:

0 = diag (1, ω01, ω02, . . . , ω0N ),
so the values (p, q) can be determined as the number of positive and negative terms
in this sequence.

(2.10)

All algebras in the family soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) (no matter of how many values ωi are
equal to zero) have an asociated Killing–Cartan metric form which can be deﬁned
in the same way as when the algebra is simple, by the trace of the product of the
adjoint representation of the generators:

A simple calculation shows that the basis Ωab diagonalises the Killing–Cartan form:

g(Ωab, Ωcd) = Trace(adΩab ·

adΩcd).

The Killing–Cartan form is only non-degenerate when the algebra is simple: in
fact, only when all ωi are diﬀerent from zero the diagonal values g(Ωab, Ωab) =
1)ωab are all diﬀerent from zero. As soon as a constant ωi is made zero,
−
this property is lost. When a single ωa = 0, then the subspace where the Killing–
Cartan form vanishes is exactly p(a), while the restriction to the subalgebra h(a) is
non-degenerate.

An important feature of homogeneous spaces is their rank. When dealing with
homogeneous spaces associated to simple Lie groups, the rank of the space (not to
be confused with the rank of the group itself) is usually deﬁned as the maximal
dimension of a totally geodesic ﬂat submanifold [9]. An alternative deﬁnition is
preferable in the context of CK homogeneous spaces: we will deﬁne the rank of a
(m) as the number of independent invariants under the
CK homogeneous space
(m). This
action of the CK group for each generic pair of elements in the space
number was ﬁrst determined by Jordan [10] when the group is the motion group of
the N-dimensional Euclidean space; it has a single invariant (the ordinary distance)
associated to each pair of points, two invariants for each pair of lines (an angle and a
m) invariants for a
distance between the two lines), and, in general, min(m, N + 1
pair of (m
1)-planes (these invariants are stationary angles and a single stationary
distance). The reason why this deﬁnition of rank is better in the CK context is that
the total number of invariant stationary angles and distances obtained by Jordan
turns out to be the same for all spaces in the CK family, i.e., do not depend on the
values ωi:

When the constant κ1 is equal to zero, and only in this case, the CK group acts

action is intrinsically non-linear. But it is possible to linearize the action for all

When κ1 = 0, the sphere (3.5) reduces to an aﬃne hyperplane in RN +1 with
equation x0 = 1, and geodesic parallel coordinates are simply cartesian coordinates
in this hyperplane.

There are two ways to characterize the metric structure of

starts by translating the Killing–Cartan form (2.12) to the rank-one language. The

The matrix of the metric g(1) in the tangent space p(1) is, in the canonical basis

Λ(1) = diag (+, κ12, κ13, . . . , κ1N ) = diag (+, κ2, κ2κ3, . . . , κ2· · ·

κN ).

(3.9)

Thus the constants κ2, κ3, . . . , κN determine the signature of the main metric at
(1). This metric can be translated to all points in the
the origin in the space
(1) by the group action, so that the action is by isometries. Now the
CK space
curvature of this metric can be computed and turns out to be constant and equal to
κ1. This completes the geometric interpretation of the constants κi in the geometry

These special properties of the subspace f(1)
a

of the tangent space at the ori-
gin when κa = 0 correspond to the existence of an invariant foliation of the space
[κ1]κ2,...,κa−1,0,κa+1...,κN itself in this case. This follows also quite clearly from the
S
equation of the sphere (3.5), which reduces when κa = 0 to an equation involving
1. Each foliation leaf is coordinatised by the re-
only the variables x0, x1, . . . , xa
−
maining variables xa, xa+1, . . . , xN , so that the subspace f(1)
is the tangent space at
a
the origin to the foliation leaf through the origin.

When there are more than one constant κa equal to zero, we have two nested

foliations, and the extension of the preceeding ideas to this case is clear.

So the picture emerging from this description is the following: the quadratic
(1) is encoded in a main metric g(1) and
a , one for each zero constant κa = 0 in the

metric structure of the rank-one space
a set of subsidiary metrics, denoted g(1)

S

list κ2, . . . , κN . These subsidiary metrics are deﬁned in each leaf of the invariant
foliation(s) associated to the zero value of the constant(s) κa = 0.

In particular, when κ2 = 0, the space

[κ1]0,κ3,...,κN has an invariant foliation
S
[κ1]. Each leaf is described by the set of
whose set of leaves is (x0)2 + κ1(x1)2 = 1
≡ S
all the values of x2, . . . , xN , and hence can be identiﬁed with a CK space
[0]κ3,...,κN .
The main metric g(1) is degenerate and vanishes in each leaf. The subsidiary metric
g(1)
is well deﬁned in each leaf. Should this look a bit involved, the paradigmatic
2
example of this case is the Galilean spacetime, discussed in the last Section (cf.
Table I below).

S

There is also an ‘extrinsic’ way to compute the main metric in

(1): start from
the CK group action in the ambient space RN +1 as a group of isometries of the ﬂat
metric:

S

(ds2)(1)

0 = (dx0)2 +

κ0l(dxl)2

(3.13)

N

Xl=1

(1) is identiﬁed
whose relation with the Killing–Cartan form is clear. As the space
with the sphere (3.5), it would be obvious to consider the restriction of this ﬂat
metric to the sphere. This restriction turns out to be proportional to κ1, and hence
it vanishes when κ1 = 0. It is therefore natural to consider the restriction of (3.13)
to the sphere taking out the factor κ1; this gives a well-deﬁned non-trivial metric in
all cases, no matter on whether κ1 is zero or not, and this metric coincides with the
one derived earlier by group theoretical reasoning.

S

Once the main metric is known, it is a simple matter to translate it to other
coordinates. We give such an expression for two diﬀerent set of coordinates. First,
we deﬁne Beltrami coordinates for the CK space

(1) as:

ηi :=

i = 1, . . . , N.

Therefore we have introduced two sets of indices (a) and i with ranges a = 1, 2,

coeﬃcients as:

Here again any two-index coeﬃcient with two equal indices (as κ11) will be always
assumed as equal to 1. Note that the constant κ1 (the old ω2) is now appearing in
all the commutators of the rank-two translations P(a)i, foreshadowing again its role
as the curvature of the space

(2).

An important step in the rank-one case is the introduction of an ambient space
(1) is embedded (the same idea
on which the CK group acts linearly, and where
can be succesfully applied for all CK spaces of any rank). All we need to carry out
this idea is to replace the vector representation of the CK group (2.4) by another

representation, acting linearly on some space and having the subgroup H (2) as the
isotropy subgroup. This is accomplished by taking the antisymmetrized square of
the vector representation, which for the brevity sake will be called here the bivector
representation of the CK group. Consider ﬁrst the following 1

By direct exponentiation of the generators (4.6) we get a group of 1

space RN (N +1)/2 = (xij) (i < j, i, j = 0, . . . N), as isometries of the metric (4.7),
and therefore the action is not transitive. It is also clear that the subgroup H (2) is
the isotropy subgroup of the point O with x01 = 1 and all other coordinates xij = 0
which will be taken as the origin. As a ﬁrst step to the determination of orbits, we

The coordinates xij in the ambient space are called Pl¨ucker coordinates for the space

analogous to the rank-one case. However there is an essential diﬀerence. The space
(2) is to be identiﬁed with the orbit of O under the group action; this orbit, with

dimension 2(N

due to a new fact for the bivector representation of the CK group, which leaves
invariant not only the quadratic form (4.7) but also a set of quadratic relations
known as Pl¨ucker relations (also Grassmann relations or even p-relations):

We can proﬁt from this new fact: in some open neighbourhood of the origin of
we can take x0j and x1j (j = 2, . . . , N) as the 2(N

(4.10)

With this choice for the inessential coordinates xkl, (k, l = 2, . . . , N) it can be indeed
shown that all the Pl¨ucker equations (and not only those with indices 01kl) become
identities. After this is done, everything is similar to the rank-one case: we have
some essential coordinates x0i, x1i, i = 2, . . . , N
1 and a single auxiliar inessential
coordinate x01 which can be eliminated by the equation of the sphere after (4.10)
has been used.

Once we have got an explicit description of the space

(2), we turn to its quadratic
metric. Similarly to the rank-one case, there is a main and an eventual set of
(2), all of which are required in order to give a
subsidiary metrics in the space
complete description of its metric structure. The main metric g(2) comes again
from the Killing–Cartan form on the algebra (2.12), when suitably restricted to the
tangent space p(2) to the origin of

non-identically zero values of the Killing–Cartan form

(2). Now the sectional curvatures of this metric
CK group acts by isometries in
can be computed, and the result can be foreseen from the commutation relations
(4.4): sectional curvatures are not constant, but they are as close to constant as
a rank-two space would allow. At the origin, the sectional curvature of the space
(2) along any 2-plane direction spanned by any two tangent vectors P(a)i, P(a)j or
S
P(a)i, P(b)i is constant and equal to κ1 (two vectors where both indices are diﬀerent
span a 2-plane for which the curvature is always identically equal to zero, no matter
of the values of the constant κ1; this is behind the classical deﬁnition of the rank of
the homogeneous space associated to a simple group). This completes the geometric
(2), and suggest a
interpretation of the constants κi in the geometry of the space
complete notation for these rank-two spaces:

κ(2)[κ1]κ2...κN−1.

From this point onwards things are rather similar to the rank-one case. Invariant
foliations appear when any κ in the set κ(2), κ2, κ3, . . . , κN

the main metric is degenerate). We start by introducing a decomposition of p(2) as:

A last comment is in order. In general, the Pl¨ucker relations xijxkl

xikxjl +
xilxjk = 0 are invariant under the bivector representation, but the r.h.s. of the
relation is not. An exception is the lowest dimensional rank-two case N = 3. Here
there is a single Pl¨ucker relation 0123, and the quadratic form x01x23
x02x13+x03x12
is also invariant; this is related to the (exceptional) known quadratic Riemannian
metric in the real Grassmannian of two-planes in four dimensions. In any other real
Grassmannian, there is up to a factor a unique Riemannian quadratic metric, which
should coincide with the one we have derived.

5 Curvature and metric in spacetimes and phase

spaces

We now turn to the physical interpretation for some of the rank-two spaces we have
studied here:
just as the rank-one CK spaces aﬀord models for all homogeneous
spacetimes (e.g., those in the Bacry and Levy–Leblond classiﬁcation [6]), their cor-
responding rank-two spaces gives models for the phase spaces of a free system whose
spacetime is a rank-one CK space. We will insist on the metric aspect, as usually the
metric structure of the phase space is disregarded in favour of the symplectic struc-
ture, upon which we have said nothing, and the metric structure which naturally
appear in our scheme cannot be easily guessed from what is more or less implicit
in the literature when dealing with phase spaces for curved spacetimes. We restrict
here to pointing out the most relevant traits.

First, a rather elementary remark is that the grouping of the 2(N

1) coordinates
of a rank-two space into two sets is intimately related to the existence of pairs of
canonically conjugated variables: the momentum-like ηi and position-like ξi coordi-
nates. Second, a warning: the notation we have tailored for rank-two spaces tries to
convey the meaning of quantities in the most close form as possible to the rank-one
case. We have used in both cases the name κ1 for the curvature of the space. This

−

is satisfactory as long as we deal with either rank-one or rank-two spaces alone,
but turns rather confusing when we insist on considering simultaneously associated
rank-one and rank-two spaces. In this case it is far better to go back to the ‘neutral’
ω notation used in the Section 2 of the paper. Each constant ωi will be interpreted
(1) or
(2); the complete notation for
diﬀerently according as we are working in

We display in Table I nine especially relevant CK spaces

S
[ω1]ω2,+,...,+ associated to the algebras
N-dimensional case. These are the spaces
soω1,ω2,+,...,+(N + 1) where the constants ω3, . . . , ωN are all positive. The ﬁrst row
gives the usual Riemannian spaces with a non-degenerate and positive deﬁnite met-
ric. The six remaining spaces are the six well known possible homogeneous kinemat-
ical spacetimes in (N
1) + 1 dimensions. In the second row we ﬁnd the ‘absolute-
time’ models associated to Newtonian spacetimes with the three possible values of
the spacetime curvature (oscillating Newton–Hooke (NH), with positive spacetime
SO(2)); Galilei, with zero curvature; and
curvature and group T2N
expanding NH, with negative curvature and group T2N
SO(1, 1))).
These three spaces have a main degenerate metric (whose length is the absolute
time) and a subsidiary well deﬁned metric (the purely spatial metric, which only
makes sense when taken on each of the leaves of the invariant foliation, here the
leaves of absolute simultaneity). In the third row the ‘relative-time’ spacetime mod-
els corresponding to relativistic spacetimes with a Lorentz type metric appear.

In terms of the rank-one spaces,

[ω1]ω2,+,...,+, ω1 is the curvature and ω2 deter-
mines the signature of the main metric. A non-zero positive ω1 is related to the

S

17

oscillating NH or Anti-DeSitter radius as ω1 = 1/R2 or to the expanding NH or
1/R2. The main met-
DeSitter characteristic length when it is negative, ω1 =
ric is deﬁnite positive when ω2 > 0 –i.e., in the Euclidean, elliptic, and hyperbolic
spaces–, degenerate when ω2 = 0 –i.e., in the Galilean and both NH spacetimes– and
Lorentzian type when ω2 < 0 –i.e., in Minkowski and both DeSitter spacetimes–;
the relation of ω2 with the standard relativistic constant c is ω2 =

1/c2.

−

In the kinematical spaces, and in parallel coordinates, a1 should be identiﬁed
with the time coordinate, the others being space coordinates. In particular, in the
three (1 + 3) Newtonian spacetimes (N = 4, κ2 = 0, κ3 = 1, κ4 = 1), the main metric
(3.17) reduces to (ds2)(1) = (da1)2, which gives a length which depends only on the
end points of the curve, but not on the path itself. The leaves of the foliation are
characterized by a1 constant, and should be identiﬁed in the three cases with an
Euclidean three-space, the subsdiary metric being given by g(1)

We now describe the metric structure of the phase spaces associated to the nine
[ω1]ω2,+,...,+ of Table I whose corresponding rank-two spaces

(identiﬁed with the space of lines in
properties, as far as their metrics are concerned, depend also on the values of the
constants ω1, ω2 but in a rather diﬀerent way to which it was formerly the case. Here
the constant ω1 appears in the signature of the main metric, so that whenever ω1 = 0
the main metric is degenerate, (and we are in presence of an invariant foliation in the
0[ω2]+,...,+ with ω1 = 0;
phase space). This happens for the three rank-two spaces
1/c2 < 0, these spaces are the sets
depending on whether ω2 > 0, ω2 = 0, ω2 =

base space and (N
1)-dimensional leaves. The base space is the rank-one space
[ω2]+,...,+ identiﬁed in kinematical terms with the velocity space, with momentum-
S
1. The degenerate main metric (4.26) reduces to a metric
like coordinates η1, . . . , ηN
in the base (N
1)-velocity space. Each leaf in the foliation is coordinatised by the
values of the position-like coordinates ξ1, . . . , ξN
1. All these results should have
been expected: when ω1 = 0 the rank-one spacetime has zero curvature; in this
case parallelism of lines is absolute, and we can meaningfully class all lines into
parallelism classes, each of which is completely described by its (common) velocity.
In particular, when ω1 = 0, ω3 = ω4 = 1 and N = 4 the expression for the degenerate
main metric in

in relativity has been known since a long time. For the Galilean case
metric in phase space degenerates into a metric on three-velocity space, which is a
ﬂat Euclidean space, with a simpler expression:

S

(ds)(2) = (dη1)2 + (dη2)2 + (dη3)2.

(5.30)

Notice that in both cases the interpretation is the same: distance in phase space
comes exclusively from the distance in the base ‘velocity space’, where it reduces to
the relative speed between two free movements. In these three ω1 = 0 cases there
is an invariant foliation, their leaves being identiﬁed with the Euclidean 3d position
space; the subsidiary metric g(2)

2 deﬁned in each leaf can be obtained from (4.26).

However, when ω1 6

= 0 (either in NH or in DeSitter spacetimes), the invariant
foliation of the phase space disappears, and the possibility of using a ‘reduced’ three
dimensional velocity space does no longer exists: phase space should be approached
as the six-dimensional space it is.

The value of the second constant ω2 determines another aspect of the geometri-
cal nature of the phase space: its curvature. The three non-relativistic phase spaces
0[0]+,...,+ and expanding NH
(where ω2 = 0), i.e., oscillating NH

that these phase spaces are six-dimensional aﬃne spaces. However, the three rel-

At this point we sum up and display the results in Table II, which is laid similarly
to Table I to make the comparation easy.

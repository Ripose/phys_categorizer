Abstract:  Threshold  amplitude  of  disturbance  for  transition  to  turbulence  in  a  pipe  Poiseuille 
flow  is  investigated.  Based  on  the  energy  gradient  theory,  we  argued  that  the  transition  to 
turbulence  depends  on  magnitudes  of  the  energy  gradient  of  mean  flow  and  the  disturbance 
energy.  Furthermore,  the  threshold  disturbance  energy  required  for  turbulence  transition  is 
expressed as a function of the complementary angle to the energy angle which also characterizes 
the  behaviour  of  the  energy  gradient  of  mean  flow.  With  some  mathematical  treatments,  the 
variation of the threshold energy of disturbance versus the Reynolds number is obtained. Then, it 
is found for a fixed disturbance frequency that the normalized amplitude of disturbance is scaled 
by  Re  with  an  exponent  of  -3/2  for  the  transition  occurrence  in  a  pipe.  This  value  of  exponent 
agrees  well  with  several  recent  results  reported  in  the  literature.  Finally,  the  mechanism  of 
transition to turbulence is suggested for different disturbance levels.

1. Introduction 
 
 
Turbulence  is  a  very  complex  phenomenon  which  has  a  long  history  of  more  than  120 
years. The purported mechanism of turbulence generation is very diverse, and the understanding 
of the flow physics of turbulence is still limited despite the ensuing years of works[1,2]. The pipe 
Poiseuille flow has been studied by many researchers since Reynolds’ famous experiment showed 
flow  transition  from  laminar  to  turbulence  [3-6].  It  is  generally  accepted  from  experiments  that 
cRe  below which little or no turbulence can be produced or 
there is a critical Reynolds number 
sustained  regardless  of  the  level  of  imposed  disturbance.  For  pipe  Poiseuille  flow,  this  critical 
cRe , the transition 
value of Reynolds number is about 2000 from experiments [3,4]. Above this 
to  turbulence  depends  to  a  large  extent  on  the  initial  disturbance  to  the  flow.  For  example, 
experiments  showed  that  if  the  disturbances  in  a  laminar  flow  can  be  carefully  avoided  or 
considerably reduced, the onset of turbulence is delayed to Reynolds numbers up to Re=O(10⁵) 
cRe , only a threshold of disturbance is reached can  
[7,8]. Experiments also showed that for Re>
transition  to  turbulence  be  effected  [6].    It  has  been  suggested  that  the  critical  disturbance

Trefethen  et  al  [7]  suggested  that  the  exponent 

amplitude  leading  to  transition  varies  broadly  with  the  Re  by  an  exponent  rule,  i.e., 
The magnitude of this exponent has significant importance for turbulence research [7,8].     
 
 
 for  plane  Couette  and  pipe 
Poiseuille flows. Lundbladh et al [9]’s direct numerical simulations showed disturbances whose 
amplitudes  scale  with  a  exponent  of  -5/4  and  -7/4  for  the  plane  Couette  and  Poiseuille  flows, 
respectively.  Baggett  et  al  [10]  proposed  a  linear  model  for  the  transition,  and  their  numerical 
results showed a scaling with an exponent of -3; however, they still surmised that the exponent 
behaves as 
.  Waleffe [11], based on his discussion on available analytical and numerical 
data,    claimed  that  for  Couette  flow  the  exponent  is  near  -1.  On  the  other  hand,  Baggett  and 
Trefethen  [12]  concluded  that  the  threshold  exponent  for  “transition”  is  strictly  less  than  -1. 
Chapman [13] through a formal asymptotic analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations found that the 
exponent is -1 and -3/2 for plane Couette flow and plane Poiseuille flow, respectively. In more 
recent time, from Darbyshire and Mullin [6]’s experiments, Trefethen et al [14] proposed that the 
 for  pipe 
amplitude  should  be  normalized  by  the  average  velocity  U,  and  obtained 
flows. Messeguer [15] carried out simulations and the results obtained seem to support the scaling 
of 
 which  compared  reasonably  with  the  experiments  of  Darbyshire  and  Mullin  [15].  
Recently,  Hof  et  al  [16]  using  pulse  disturbance  in  experiments,  obtained  the  normalized 
disturbance flow rate in the pipe as inversely proportional to the Re number, i.e., 
 
However,  experiments  also  showed  that  the  threshold  amplitude  ( A )  is  related  to  the 
 
frequency  of  the  disturbance  [6].  For  a  given  Re,  the  higher  the ω,  the  smaller  is  the  A .  This 
result  demonstrated  that  the  critical  condition  is  not  solely  determined  by  the  disturbance 
amplitude, but by both the amplitude and the frequency. This suggests that the magnitude of the 
disturbance energy may yet be a key factor affecting transition because frequency is related to the 
energy. The detailed behaviour and dynamics of the disturbance energy action is very complex. 
 
 
Currently,  all  of  the  major  theories  of  flow  instability,  including  linear  theory,  energy 
method,  weak  nonlinear  theory,  and  second  instability  theory,  can  not  fully  or  satisfactorily 
explain the critical Reynolds number problem of flow instability in parallel flows [1, 2]. Recently, 
Dou  [17]  proposed  a  new  theory  for  flow  instability  and  turbulence  transition  based  on  energy 
gradient concept. This theory uses an energy gradient parameter as a criterion for the subcritical

transition  and  the  said  parameter  suggests  a  consistent  value  for  plane  Poiseuille  flow,  pipe 
Poiseuille  flow  and  plane  Couette  flow  for  the  critical  condition  of  turbulent  transition.  The 
energy gradient parameter can be also expressed by the so-called “energy angle,” see Fig.1  
 
In this paper, based on the energy gradient theory, we explore the transition condition in 
 
the high Re range. We argued that the transition to turbulence depends on the energy gradient of 
mean flow and the disturbance energy. Furthermore, it is assumed that the energy of disturbance 
is  proportional  to  the  complementary  angle  of  the  energy  angle,  and  the  variation  of  critical 
amplitude versus the Reynolds number is derived. As such, the effect of frequency of disturbance 
is shown since the disturbance energy is proportional to the square of the disturbance frequency. 
The theory is then compared with experiments and the results from other researchers.  
 
2. Energy gradient theory 
 
 
Linear  stability  theory  represents  quite  the  state-of-the-art  of  research  for  flow  stability 
problems; it obtains agreement with experiments for some problems such as Rayleigh-Benard and 
Taylor-Couette flows and partial agreement with experiment for plane boundary layer problem. 
However,  the  subcritical  condition  of  turbulent  transition  predicted  by  linear  stability  theory 
differs  largely  from  the  experiments  for  wall  bounded  parallel  flows.  Other  theories  including 
energy  method,  weak  nonlinear  theory,  and  second  instability  theory,  also  can  not  obtain 
satisfactory agreement with experiments either for this class of wall bounded flows [1,2,7,8].  
 
 
Partly  motivated  by  the  above  stated  problem,  Dou  [17]  proposed  an  energy  gradient 
theory  with  the  aim  to  clarify  the  mechanism  of  transition  from  laminar  to  turbulence  for  wall 
bounded  shear  flows.  Here,  we  give  a  short  discussion  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  work 
presented  in  this  study.  In  the  theory,  the  whole  flow  field  is  treated  as  an  energy  field.  It  is 
thought  that  the  gradient  of  total  energy  in  the  transverse  direction  of  the  main  flow  and  the 
viscous  friction  in  the  streamwise  direction  dominate  the  instability  phenomena  and  hence  the 
flow  transition  for  a  given  disturbance.  The  energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  has  the 
potential  to  amplify  a  velocity  disturbance,  while  the  viscous  friction  loss  in  the  streamwise 
direction  can  resist  and  absorb  this  disturbance.  The  transition  to  turbulence  depends  on  the 
relative  magnitude  of  these  two  roles  of  energy  gradient  amplification  and  viscous  friction 
damping to the initial disturbance. Based on such, a new dimensionless parameter, K (the ratio of 
the energy gradient in the transverse direction to that in the streamwise direction), is defined to 
characterize the stability of the base flow,

energy gradient is resulted by the energy loss due to viscous friction. Therefore, for shear driven 
flows,  the  calculation  of  K  can  be  obtained  by  the  ratio  of  the  energy  gradient  in  transverse

parameter  K  in  Eq.(1)  is  a  field  variable.  Thus,  the  distribution  of  K  in  the  flow  field  and  the 
property  of  disturbance  may  be  the  perfect  means  to  describe  the  disturbance  amplification  or 
decay in the flow. It is suggested that the flow instability can first occur at the position of  maxK
 
which  is  construed  to  be  the  most  “dangerous”  position.    Thus,  for  a  given  disturbance,  the 
occurrence  of  instability  depends  on  the  magnitude  of  this  dimensionless  parameter  K  and  the 
critical  condition  is  determined  by  the  maximum  value  of  K  in  the  flow.  For  a  given  flow 
geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of K in the flow field is larger than a critical 
cK , it is expected that instability can occur for certain initial disturbance [17]. The analysis 
value 
has suggested that the transition to turbulence is due to the energy gradient and the disturbance 
amplification, rather than just the linear eigenvalue instability type as in stated in [7, 8], because 
the pipe Poiseuille flow is linearly stable for all the Reynolds number. Both Grossmann [8] 
and  Trefethen  et  al.  [7]  commented  that  the  nature  of  the  onset-of-turbulence  mechanism  in 
parallel shear flows must be different from an eigenvalue instability of linear equations of small 
disturbance. In fact, finite disturbance is needed for the turbulence initiation in the range of finite 
Re as found in experiments [6]. Dou [17] demonstrated that the criterion obtained has a consistent 
value at the subcritical condition of the transition determined by the experimental data for plane 
Poiseuille flow, pipe Poiseuille flow as well as plane Couette flow (see Table 1). From this table 
cK  at 
it can be deduced that the turbulence transition takes place at a consistent critical value of 
about  385  for  both  the  plane  Poiseuille  flow  and  pipe  Poiseuille  flow,  and  about  370  for  plane 
Couette  flow.  This  may  suggest  that  the  subcritical  transition  in  parallel  flows  takes  place  at  a 
cK ≈ 370-385.  The  finding  further  suggests  that  the  flow  instability  is  likely  resulted 
value  of 
from  the  action  of  energy  gradients,  and  not  due  strictly  to  the  eigenvalue  instability  of  linear 
equations.  The  critical  condition  for  flow  instability  as  determined  by  linear  stability  analysis 
differs largely from the experimental data for all the three different types of flows, as shown in 
Table 1.

averaged velocity,  0u  the velocity at the mid-plane of the channel, D the diameter of the pipe, h

The  proposed  principle  can  be  used  for  pressure  and  shear  driven  flows.  If  we  assume 
 
that there is no energy input (such as shear) to the system or energy output from the system, this 
criterion can be employed to predict that the viscous flow with an inflectional velocity profile is 
unstable [18]. This can be explained as follow. If there is an inflection point in the velocity profile, 
the energy gradient in the streamwise direction from viscous friction is zero at the inflection point, 
while the energy gradient in the transverse direction is generally not zero. Thus, the value of K at 
the  inflection  point  will  be  infinite,  see  Eq.(1).  Therefore,  even  a  small  disturbance  will  be

amplified at the inflection point by the transverse energy gradient. Following this principle, it is 
demonstrated that viscous parallel flow with inflectional velocity profile is a sufficient condition 
for flow instability for both two-dimensional and axisymmetrical flows if they are subjected to a 
disturbance  [18].  The  inviscid  instability  and  viscous  instability  are  compared  in  Table  2  [18]. 
Rayleigh  (1880)  theorem  for  inflection  instability  of  inviscid  was  obtained  only  from 
mathematics, the physical mechanism for this theorem is still not clear.

[18].  The critical value of K (
cK ) depends on the flow geometry and fluid property. For both 2D 
cK =370. Two-dimensional and 
and pipe Poiseuille flows, 
axisymmetrical  (along  convex  and  concave  surfaces)  viscous  flows  with  inflectional  velocity 
profile are all unstable [18].  
 
 
In experiments, flow transition is usually dependent on two broad factors: main flow and 
disturbance [1,2]. In the energy gradient theory, the condition of main flow is determined by the 
parameter  K.  This  parameter  can  be  considered  as  a  local  Re  number.  The  condition  of 
disturbance  is  determined  by  the  average  energy  of  disturbance  because  flow  instability  and 
transition is a process of energy evolution and the transition must be excited by a sufficient level 
of  energy  disturbance.  We  can  therefore  suggest  that  the  turbulence  transition  depends  on  the 
energy gradient parameter of base flow and the disturbance energy. 
 
 
Although laminar-to-turbulent transition can occur via several mechanisms, such as linear 
instability, bypass transition (skip linear instability), Gortler instability (flow on concave surface), 
and cross-flow instability (flow over swept wing) [19], all of these instabilities can be included or 
analyzed under the framework of instabilities associated with the energy gradient [17]. The total 
energy  E  in Eq.(1) includes kinetic, pressure and gravitational energies for incompressible flow.  
A similar equation can be written for compressible flow (thermal energy and kinetic energy). A 
specified  form  of  the  instability  may  be  induced  by  only  one  of  the  energies.  For  example,  the 
instability in parallel shear flows is generated by the gradient of kinetic energy; Rayleigh-Taylor 
instability  (a  higher  density  fluid  over  a  lower  density  fluid)  is  produced  by  the  gravitational 
energy  gradient;  the  cross-flow  instability  (flow  over  swept  wing)  is  resulted  from  the  lateral 
pressure  gradient  of  the  main  flow  (this  pressure  gradient  is  perpendicular  to  the  streamwise 
direction); Gortler instability is induced by the pressure gradient across the boundary layer on a 
concave surface. In some occasions instability may be dominated by the mixed roles of various 
energies (for example, Taylor-Couette instability of flow between two rotating cylinders at high 
Taylor’s number which is dominated by pressure and kinetic energies). In the complex process of 
the instability generation, some of these may be mutually enhanced or compensated. If there is no 
energy gradient in the flow field (uniform flow), none of the instabilities will be generated. All of 
the instabilities in nature are produced by the non-uniformity of the energy distribution in space 
and  time.  The  evolution  of  natural  environments  can  be  also  viewed  as  a  result  of  the  energy 
gradient roles.

3. Parameter K for pipe Poiseuille flow 
 
 
The  derivation  of  energy  gradient  parameter  K  for  Poiseuille  flows  has  been  given  in 
detail  in  [17].  Here,  we  just  briefly  describe  the  equations  for  the  pipe  flow  for  use  in  later 
sections. For pipe Poiseuille flow, the momentum equation of steady flow is written as, 
 

 
This equation shows that viscous force term is proportional to the streamwise pressure gradient.

which shows that the kinetic energy gradient in the radial direction increases quadratically with 
the pressure gradient. 
 
According to the energy gradient theory, the flow instability in the pipe depends on the 
competition  between  the  kinetic  energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  (Eq.(4))  and  the 
viscous  term  (Eq.(2)).  With  increasing  axial  pressure  gradient 
 (or  Re),  the  former 
becomes larger at a rate faster than the latter (quadratic versus linear). Therefore, at large pressure 
gradient (or Reynolds number), the role of energy gradient dominates over the viscous friction. 
This  can  lead  to  the  transition  to  turbulence  which  occurs  at  large  Re  number.  The  energy 
gradient parameter K, the ratio of the two terms, clearly describes the process as Re increases.  
 
term, K, is (∂p/∂r=0),

is proportional to Re for a fixed point in the flow field. 
 
The distribution of u, E, and K along the transverse direction for pipe Poiseuille flow is 
shown in Fig.2. It is clear that there is a maximum value of K at r/R=0.5774, as shown in Fig.2. 
This maximum can also be obtained by differentiating Eq.(5)  with r/R and setting the derivatives 
equal  to  zero.  Experiments  have  shown  that  the  minimum  Re  number  for  the  transition  to 
turbulence  occurs  at  about  2000  [3,4].  Employing  this  experimental  data  in  Eq.(5),  we  obtain 
maxK
 
The instability in Poiseuille flows with increasing mean velocity U is described below for 
a given fluid and flow geometry using the energy gradient concept. It has been suggested that the 
flow breakdown of the Poiseuille flow should not suddenly occur in the entire flow field, but it 
first  takes  place  at  the  location  of  maxK
 in  the  domain  and  then  spreads  out  according  to  the 
distribution  of  K  value  [17].  The  formation  of  turbulence  spot  in  shear  flows  may  well  be 
explained using this procedure. In the shear flow, when the K value at a position reaches a critical 
value, the influence of kinetic energy gradient dominates over that of viscous friction. The flow at 
this position will amplify any disturbance, then transit to turbulence if the threshold disturbance is 
satisfied. Thus, a turbulent spot can be formed around this position. In another word, turbulence 
transition is a local phenomenon in the earlier stage. When the Re is further increased, this spot 
will grow in dimension. If the Reynolds number is sufficiently large, the full flow will transit to 
turbulence.  
 
In  a  recent  study  for  pipe  flow,  Wedin  and  Kerswell  [20]  showed  that  there  is  the 
presence  of  the  "shoulder"  in  the  velocity  profile  at  about  r/R=0.6  from  their  solution  of  the 
traveling  waves.  They  suggested  that  this  corresponds  to  where  the  fast  streaks  reach  from  the 
wall. It can be construed that this kind of velocity profile as obtained by simulation is similar to 
that of Nishioka et al's experiments for channel flows [21]. The location of the "shoulder" is about 
same as that for  maxK
. According to the present theory, this "shoulder" may then be intricately 
related to the distribution of energy gradient. 
For a plane Poiseuille flow, the maximum value of K is located at y/h= ± 0.5774, fairly 
 
similar  to  pipe  flow.  This  position  should  then  be  the  most  dangerous  location  for  flow 
breakdown, which has been confirmed by Nishioka et al’s experiment [21]. Nishioka et al's [21] 
experiments  for  plane  Poiseuille  flow  showed  details  of  the  outline  and  process  of  the  flow 
breakdown. The measured instantaneous velocity distributions indicate that the first oscillation of 
the velocity occurs at y/h=0.50~0.62.  
 
As can be noted from Eq.(5), K is proportional to the global Reynolds number. A large 
value of K has the ability to amplify the disturbance, and vice versa. Therefore, at high Re, the 
disturbance energy needed to trigger transition becomes correspondingly smaller.

The relation of parameter K with the energy angle α follows from Eq.(1),  (see also Fig.1): 
 

Dou [17] proposed the concept of energy angle based on the theory of energy gradient.

4.2 Calculation of average energy of disturbance in a period 
4.2.1 Average energy of sine wave disturbance function 
 
 
In the (usual) experiments on turbulence transition, the initial disturbance to the pipe flow 
is generally produced at the inlet section by various means. In later sections, we will compare the 
theory  with  the  experiments  in  [6].  In  order  to  better  understand  the  derivation  below,  a  brief 
introduction  to  the  experiment  in  [6]  is  given.  In  the  experiment,  the  disturbance  is  introduced 
into  the  pipe  by  means  of  jet(s)  which  is  driven  from  a  motor  and  piston  system.  A  valve  is 
mounted  at  the  outlet  of  the  device  to  stops  fluid  being  sucked  out  of  the  pipe  system  on  the 
return  stroke  of  the  piston.  There  are  two  kinds  of  disturbance  inlet  geometries  used  in  the 
experiments.  The  first  is  that  the  disturbance  at  the  pipe  is  in  the  form  of  a  single  jet  injected 
orthogonally to the main stream flow through a small hole opening on the pipe wall. The second 
geometry consists of an arrangement of valves and tubes which are used to produce multiple (six) 
jets  of  small  diameter  directed  azimuthally  to  the  pipe  flow  so  as  to  introduce  a  component  of 
swirl  into  the  main  flow  field.  Two  parameters  A  (amplitude)  and ω (disturbance  frequency) 
along  with  the  diameters  of  the  inlets  to  the  pipe  characterize  the  disturbances  in  terms  of  the 
average flow rate of the disturbance and total mass flux added to the main flow. The parameter A 
is the maximum amplitude of the disturbance taken to be the distance of the travel of the piston. 
The speed of disturbance jet is almost linear after the initial impulse.  
 
For  comparison,  we  first  give  the  calculation  of  disturbance  energy  for  a  disturbance 
 
associated with a sinusoidal movement of the piston. That is, the motion of the piston is expressed 
by the equation, 
 
 
 
where A is the maximum axial movement of the piston (which has exactly the same meaning as 
that in the experiments of Darbyshire and Mullin [6]),  ω is the frequency of the disturbance, t is 
0ϕ  is  the  phase  angle  at  initial  position.  Thus,  the  velocity  of  the  piston  can  be 
the  time,  and 
expressed as a cosine function (Fig.4), 
 
 
 
The added fluid volume to the pipe by injection should be equal to the fluid volume displaced out 
1S  is 
by the piston. The maximum disturbance in volume due to the piston motion is 
the cross-sectional area of the piston. The corresponding maximum disturbance in volume in the 
pipe  is  the  same  as  that  associated  with  the  piston,

4.2.2 Average energy of disturbance in Darbyshire and Mullin’s pipe flow experiments 
 
In  the  experiments  of  Darbyshire  and  Mullin[6],  the  disturbance  input  is  done  with  jet 
injection at the inlet part of the pipe which is associated with the piston movement. The piston is 
driven by a mechanical mechanism with a periodic motion. The velocity disturbance due to the 
movement of the piston is not a cosine function. The velocity variation of the piston with time can 
be expressed as (pulse-linear disturbance, see Fig.4),

It is seen from Eqs.(24) and (27) that the average kinetic energy for unit mass fluid in a period for 
pulse-linear disturbance in [6] is less than that for cosine velocity disturbance, and the latter is 1.5 
times of the former.

 for the pipe Poiseuille flow. 

 
This  result  of  Eq.(34)  or  Eq.(35)  is  in  agreement  with  Chapman  [13],  Meseguer  [15],  and 
Trefethen et al  [14]; all attained a component of 
 
5. Further comparison of theory with experiments 
 
 
Equation  (33)  is  depicted  in  Fig.5  and  compared  with  Darbyshire  and  Mullin’  [6] 
experiments.  The  magnitude  of  the  proportional  constant  in  Eq.(33)  does  not  feature  for 
understanding the mechanism as stated by Meseguer  [15].  It can be found that the disturbance 
amplitude decreases with Re for both the theory and experiments. Equation (33) has shown good 
agreement with the experimental data for the range of large Re (Re=2700--10000). This provides 
support  that  the  present  model  is  reasonable  in  the  large  Re  range.  However,  the  trend  of 
amplitude variation versus Re has still not been satisfactorily explained thus far. Some numerical 
simulations  with  traveling  waves  in  pipe  flow  have  indicated  that  the  development  of  these 
traveling waves ultimately harbors a turbulent attractor as Re increases [22,23]. 
 
According  to  the  energy  gradient  theory  [17],  the  mechanism  of  disturbance  vis-a-vis 
Reynolds number (Fig.5) can be explained as follows. With increasing Re, K increases and the 
energy  angle α also  increases.  Thus,  a  large  transverse  energy  gradient  facilitates  the  energy 
exchange between the fluid layers. This exchange of energy will amplify the disturbance in the 
flow and finally lead to transition if both the energy gradient and the disturbance amplitude are 
sufficiently  large.  At  higher  energy  angle  condition,  the  ability  of  mean  flow  to  amplify  the 
disturbance  becomes  greater.  Thus,  the  initial  disturbance  energy  needed  for  the  transition  is 
correspondingly reduced. 
 
From Fig.5, the experimental data show that the exponent γ varies at different Re range, 
 
and  it  can  not  be  represented  by  a  single  constant  in  the  Re  range  considered.  Therefore,  it  is 
commented  that  the  analysis  and  the  exponent  found  in  Chapman  [13]  may  not  be  universal.  
Meseguer’s [15] simulations (Fig.8b) also show that the critical amplitude can not be expressed 
by  a  single  exponent  in  the  whole  Re  range,  although  some  recent  experiments  with  a  pulse 
disturbance have indicated that 
 for a large Re range  [16]. Further studies are needed to 
clarify these problems. 
 
Darbyshare  and  Mulin’s  experiments  [6]  showed  that  for  a  given  Re  (so  is  maxK
 
),  the 
critical  amplitude  also  depends  on  the  frequency  of  the  disturbance.  The  experiments  with  a 
single jet injection showed that the critical amplitude A decreases with increasing frequency. This 
suggests that the disturbance energy is a key factor. The experimental data also showed that this 
critical energy of disturbance is not a constant with the variation of frequency at a fixed Re. The 
experimental results at Re=2200 in [6] are depicted in Fig.6. The symbols are the experimental 
data for critical amplitude A versus the frequency of the injection. A best correlation is achieved 
A2ω =constant as indicated by the solid line drawn in the same figure. Thus, the disturbance 
energy  is   
 with  C  as  a  constant,  which  shows  that  the  critical  energy  is 
proportional to the amplitude for a given Re when the disturbance frequency is allowed to vary. 
The mechanism or mechanics for this behaviour is not clear, and may be related to the complex 
process  of  turbulence  generation,  which  needs  further  investigation.    In  the  above  relation,  it 
should be noted that A is not infinitely small, otherwise the disturbance frequency will be infinite. 
 
Although a few studies have been carried out on the mechanism of transition, the detailed 
 
development  and  process  during  the  transition  have  still  largely  not  been  clarified  or  fully 
understood. In fact, the transition to turbulence is considered by some to be a redistribution of the

energy  in  the  flow.  As  discussed  earlier,  the  origin  and  the  process  in  the  transition  are  all 
dominated by the energy gradient. The excitation of the process is initiated and attributed to the 
disturbance.  A  sufficient  magnitude  of  energy  in  the  disturbance  is  a  necessary  condition  for 
transition.  Since  the  disturbance  energy  is  proportional  to  the  amplitude  and  the  square  of  the 
frequency, the critical condition is also related to the frequency. For  Re  larger than the minimum 
cRe ,  a  small  disturbance  may  not  be  enough  to  stimulate  the 
transition  Reynolds  number, 
transition, but this disturbance can lead to oscillation of the base flow (incompressible). This flow 
oscillation  may  be  associated  with  the  Tollmien-Schlichting  waves  with  resulting  streamwise 
streaks. For the said Reynolds number range, if the disturbance energy is sufficiently large (i.e., 
exceeding  the  threshold  value),  the  flow  may  “skip”  the  Tollmien-Schlichting  waves  (namely 
bypass  transition).  At  this  large  disturbance,  the  base  flow  may  be  lead  to  a  velocity  profile 
inflectional  such  that  the  flow  transits  to  turbulence  via  three-dimensional  vortex  diffusion 
mechanism.  Following  the  idea  developed  in  this  paper,  the  route  of  the  events  during  the 
transition is suggested for the different initial disturbances:

6. Concluding Summary 
 
 
Energy gradient theory was proposed for laminar-turbulence instability [17]. It has been 
demonstrated that this theory is valid at least for parallel flows in [17]. In this paper, based on the 
energy gradient theory, we argued that the transition to turbulence depends on the energy gradient 
of mean flow and the disturbance energy. Furthermore, the threshold disturbance energy required 
for  turbulence  transition  is  expressed  as  a  function  of  the  complementary  angle  ( β)  to  the 
energy  angle  (α )  which  characterizes  the  behaviour  of  the  energy  gradient  of  mean  flow. 
Employing the Taylor series expansion of the functional and some simplifications, the variation 
of  the  threshold  amplitude  of  disturbance  versus  the  Reynolds  number  is  derived.  In  the 
derivation, the effect of frequency of disturbance on the transition is shown and which is depicted 
by  the  disturbance  energy  being  proportional  to  the  square  of  the  disturbance  frequency.  It  is 
found that the normalized amplitude of disturbance scales with Re by an exponent of -3/2 for the 
transition condition in pipe flow. This finding is in agreement with Chapman [13], Meseguer [15], 
and Trefethen et al [14]. From the theory and the coupled with experimental data analysis, it is 
observed  that  the  energy of  the  disturbance  is  the  key  factor  to  excite  the  transition  rather  than 
only  the  amplitude.  Finally,  it  is  suggested  that  the  energy  gradient  theory  presents  yet  another 
possible approach for the description of the turbulent transition. In addition, the phenomenon of 
variation  of  the  disturbance  amplitude  A  versus  the  disturbance  frequency ω for  a  given  Re, 
A2ω =constant, which is deduced from experimental data, needs further investigation.

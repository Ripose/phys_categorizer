Cryogenically cooled microelectromagnet mirrors were used to reflect a cloud of free-falling laser-

cooled 85Rb atoms at normal incidence.  The mirrors consisted of microfabricated current-carrying

Au wires in a periodic serpentine pattern on a sapphire substrate.  The fluorescence from the atomic

cloud was imaged after it had bounced off a mirror.  The transverse width of the cloud reached a

local minimum at an optimal current corresponding to minimum mirror roughness.  A distinct

increase in roughness was found for mirror configurations with even versus odd number of lines.

These observations confirm theoretical predictions.

In recent years there has been an increased effort to design and construct optical elements

for neutral atoms including mirrors, gratings, and lenses [1].  Atom mirrors have been

demonstrated using evanescent light fields [2,3] and evanescent static magnetic fields [4-7]; curved

mirrors have been formed using evanescent light fields [2] and magnetized floppy discs [6] to

focus and gravitationally trap atoms.  Exponentially decaying magnetic field mirrors were proposed

to reflect neutrons [8], atoms, and molecules [9], and permanent magnet [4-7] and

microelectromagnet atom mirrors [10-12] have been demonstrated.  Microelectromagnet atom

mirrors consisting of parallel lines of alternating current [10-12] can additionally create time-

dependent potentials thus forming adaptive atom optics [11].  Ultimately, microelectromagnet

mirrors promise an impressive “flatness” for several reasons: 1) microfabrication can produce

precisely controlled wire shapes and geometries on substrates with excellent surface smoothness,

2) the detrimental effect of possible wire irregularities on magnetic field equipotentials is

suppressed by electrical current conservation [10,11], and 3) the strength of mirrors can be

adjusted by applying time-dependent currents.

In this Letter, we describe the properties of microelectromagnet mirrors to reflect a cloud of

free-falling laser-cooled Rb atoms at normal incidence.  We imaged the reflected cloud, dropped

from a magneto-optical trap, and measured its size as a function of mirror current.  This is the first

experimental study of the influence of the finite size of the mirror on the reflective properties of

microelectromagnet mirrors consisting of current-carrying wires.  The experiment confirms recent

theoretical predictions of surprising and nontrivial dependence of mirror roughness on mirror

current and on mirror parity [13]: the measured roughness reaches a local minimum at an optimal

current, rather than decreasing monotonically as current increases, and mirrors with an odd N

number of wires are smoother than mirrors with even N.

Figure 1(a) shows a photograph of a microelectromagnet atom mirror consisting of a

serpentine pattern of current-carrying Au wires on a sapphire substrate, together with a schematic

diagram of the wire pattern (Fig. 1(b)) and a profilometer trace of the wire profile (Fig. 1(c)).  The

details of fabrication, magnetic field calibration, and thermal properties have been reported earlier

2

[10].  Mirrors have been made from normal metals (Au, Ag, Cu) and superconductors (Nb) with

periods [a in Fig. 1(c)] ranging from a = 12 m m to a = 200 m m, and covering areas up to 1 cm2.

We use optical lithography to control precisely the mirror geometry across large surface areas.  To

achieve the high current carrying capabilities of our mirrors, the wires are made thicker by

electroplating, heat sunk onto a sapphire substrate, and cryogenically cooled as described in [10].

The fabricated mirrors used in this experiment thus permitted high current densities up to

~ 107 A/cm2 and magnetic fields to B ~ 0.1T with gradients |(cid:209) B|  ~ 100 T/cm.  The wire widths

w, heights h, and spacings (a/2–w) can be continuously varied in fabrication by adjusting the

electroplating parameters to grow the wires to desired sizes and aspect ratios [14].  This flexibility

is important, because recent simulations showed that optimization and control of wire profiles is

useful to make high quality mirrors [13].

Unless otherwise noted, the mirror specifications in the present experiment are: active area

1 x 1 cm2 of the serpentine pattern of Au wires, period a = 200 m m, N  = 101 lines, resistance

R = 40 W  at room temperature, and R = 10 W  at 77 K.  An additional wire segment with the

same profile and spacing, with resistance ~ 0.4 W  at room temperature was added to the original

mirror, as shown in Fig.1(b), to allow increasing the number of wires from odd to even during the

experiment.  Figure 1(c) shows a profilometer trace of a duplicate mirror with the same process

parameters and resistance as the one used in the experiment, with the wire width w »

 70 m m and

height h »

 7 m m indicated.  To avoid damaging the mirror, we have applied currents only up to 3

A at liquid nitrogen temperatures, which corresponds to fields up to ~ 30 mT at the surface of the

wires.

 The operation of the atom mirror is based on the Zeeman interaction between an

inhomogeneous magnetic field and the atomic magnetic dipole moment [9].  For an infinite number

of infinitely long wires, the field decays exponentially B

surface, x  is the distance along the mirror and perpendicular to the wires, I is the current in the

wires, and a   and e   are coefficients determined by wire shape and spacing [8-10].  The field

magnitude and not the direction controls the reflection of slowly moving atoms in the adiabatic

regime when the atomic magnetic moment follows the local field direction and the magnetic

quantum number mF  of the atomic substate is a constant of motion [8,9].  Consequently, the

m
gradient force due to the magnetic field is F = -gFmF

B

(cid:209) B, where m

B is the Bohr magneton, and gF

is the Lande g factor.  Atoms in weak field seeking states (mFgF > 0) are reflected elastically from

high fields near the mirror.  As shown below in Fig. 2, deviations from perfect specular reflection

are caused by the small corrugations/roughness in the magnetic field equipotentials that deviate

from perfectly flat lines parallel to the mirror surface.  For an infinitely large microelectromagnet

mirror, the effects of the corrugations decrease monotonically with the increasing mirror current

[9].

Several authors have noted theoretical differences between the reflective properties of a

realistic mirror with a finite number of wires and the ideal mirror with an infinite number of wires

(or analogously, in the case of permanent magnet mirrors, between finite and infinite numbers of

magnetic domains) [5,12,13].  It has been pointed out [5] that the performance of finite mirrors can

be improved by adding compensating wires to the edges of the mirror along the y-direction (see

Fig. 1 (b)).  Recent theoretical work [13] has shown that the roughness of a finite mirror operated

at constant currents (even one with additional compensating wires) reaches a minimum value at a

finite current, in contrast to the infinitely large mirror that always becomes less corrugated with

increasing currents.  Moreover, the roughness of a finite mirror was also predicted to depend

critically on whether the number of lines in the mirror array is even or odd.  Both of these

predictions can be understood by noting that the field of the finite mirror,  B

=

B

fin

B

miss, where

Binf is the vector field of an infinite mirror, and Bmiss is the vector field due to wires in the infinite

mirror that are missing in the finite mirror.  Atoms are reflected from surfaces of constant B-field

magnitude, which for an ideal infinite mirror are constant z planes:

.  In the case of a finite mirror with an odd (even) number of

wires, the current distributions producing Bmiss are roughly parallel (antiparallel) on the opposite

-
sides of the mirror.  From symmetry, this results in a Bmiss that is small (large) near the center of

the mirror, making the odd mirror flatter than the even.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show computed contours (equipotentials) of constant magnetic field

magnitude B above the centers of two microelectromagnet mirrors with even (N = 102) and odd

(N = 101) numbers of wires; the wires in the array are taken for simplicity to have rectangular

cross-sections.  The field contours exhibit interesting and nontrivial features at heights z ~ a

above the mirror.  Because the field from an infinite array decays exponentially, the effect of the

end wires in a finite serpentine array is felt at a finite height above the mirror center.  The first

interesting feature, in contrast to the infinite N case, is that the magnetic field contours for finite N

in Fig. 2 best approximate straight lines at a finite height above the mirror.  Because the height at

which atoms of a certain initial velocity are reflected is determined by mirror current I, the

roughness is smallest at approximately the current which gives a turning point in the region where

the equipotentials are most straight.  A second interesting feature is that mirrors with an even

number of wires N (Fig. 2(a)) have more corrugated equipotentials than those with odd N (Fig.

2(b)).

The experimental setup used to reflect cold atoms from microelectromagnet mirrors is

schematically illustrated in Figure 3(a).  A cloud of cold 85Rb atoms in the 52 S1/2 F = 3 electronic

ground state is accumulated and cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT).  The atomic setup was the

same as in Ref. [3].  The number of trapped atoms is ~ 3 x 107 in a volume ~ 0.5 mm3 with root-

mean-square atom velocity vrms ~ 36 mm/s.  The atom cloud is released from the MOT with

center at a constant height H = 19.6 mm above the mirror, and optically pumped during the fall

into the |F = 3, mF = 3 > state.  A 1.06 mm wide slit mounted @

 3 mm above the mirror defines the

width of the atom cloud which reaches the center of the mirror.  The mirror is mounted on a copper

cold finger and cooled by continuously flowing liquid nitrogen to lower the mirror resistance and

increase the thermal conductivity of the mirror and the sapphire substrate.  The temperature of the

mirror is estimated to be ~ 100 K from the known temperature dependence of the mirror resistance.

Rectangular current pulses with amplitudes I and duration 5 ms coinciding with the arrival of the

5

atom cloud were applied to the mirror every 1.5 s.  The pulsed mode operation together with

cryogenic cooling of the mirror significantly reduced the average heat dissipation and allowed for

higher currents and field strengths.  To ensure that atoms adiabatically follow the magnetic field

direction, i.e. remain in the mF = 3 state, a constant holding field Bh = 10 m T was applied along the

y-direction parallel to the mirror lines and perpendicular to the mirror field (see Fig. 3(a)).

The width of the atom cloud was measured by a horizontal retroreflected probe laser beam

during the free fall after the first bounce, and during the fall back before the second bounce.  The

probe laser beam was positioned at height Z = 9.4 mm above the mirror (see Fig. 3 (a)).  The

spatial extent of the probe beam was 1.4 mm in the z-direction by 1.0 cm in the y-direction, its

power density was 1.1 mW/cm2, and it was detuned 5 MHz from the fluorescence line.  The

fluorescence was imaged by a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera looking down at the mirror

along the z-direction [3].  The stray-light background recorded by the camera was subtracted from

the fluorescence signal.

Figures 3(b) and 3(c) show typical fluorescence images of the atom cloud together with

fluorescence profiles along the x-direction after the bounce (Fig. 3(b)) and as the atom cloud falls

back (Fig. 3(c)) before the second bounce on the mirror.  The profiles empirically fit Gaussian

.  From fits to measured profiles such as those in Fig. 3 we

obtain the root-mean-square width wrms of the cloud at height Z = 9.4 mm above the mirror.  Had

the atoms been reflected specularly by an ideally smooth infinite mirror, the intrinsic width wo

would then be determined by the initial momentum and spatial distribution of the atoms in the

cloud, the drop height, the slit width, and the effect of the probe laser; Monte-Carlo simulations of

a specular reflection give wo = 2.54 mm [15].  The actual measured widths of the atomic cloud

wrms  are larger than wo  because the actual mirror, finite in size, is not ideally smooth.  We have

used the fitted width of the atomic cloud to study the reflective mirror properties as a function of

current and to compare mirrors with odd and even numbers of wires.

Figure 4 shows the experimental width wrms of the reflected atomic clouds falling back

under gravity toward the mirror as a function of mirror current I for mirrors with N = 101 and

6

-
N = 102 wires.  The number of wires was changed during measurements by energizing the

additional wire segment shown in Fig. 1(b).  As predicted theoretically, the data of Fig. 4 clearly

show three mirror properties:  (1) a  threshold current Ith for atom reflection, (2) an optimal current

Iopt at which the width of the reflected cloud is minimized, and (3) a pronounced increase in width

for the mirror with an even number of wires.  (1)  Reflection is only observed at mirror currents

above the threshold Ith @

 0.35 A, as shown in Fig. 4.  As the current increases, the magnetic field

increases, and the height of the turning point for the atom bounce increases.  The threshold occurs

when atoms no longer hit the wires or substrate.  The minimum magnetic field required to reflect

85Rb atoms in the mF = 3 ground state dropped from H  = 19.6 mm is calculated from the incident
atomic energy to be Bth @  3 mT at the turning point.  This value agrees well with a threshold
estimated from the computed magnetic field 2.9 mT for Ith at the top of 70 x 7 m m2 rectangular

wires using simple Biot-Savart calculations.  Close to threshold the measured width wrms of the

reflected cloud is comparable for odd and even mirrors,  consistent with the fact that the magnetic

field equipotentials for even and odd mirrors shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) are comparable near the

wires.  (2)  In contrast to the simpler infinite mirror case, the transverse width wrms of the atom

cloud is minimized at an optimal mirror current.  For even N = 102 the optimal current is around

Iopt ~ 1 A and for odd N = 101 it is around Iopt ~ 1.5 A, as shown in Fig. 4.  From Fig. 2 we can

understand that the mirror will be least corrugated when the current is approximately adjusted to

give a turning point in the smoothest magnetic field contour region, and that the mirror with even N

will have a lower optimal current than the mirror with odd N.  The increase in the measured width

wrms over the width wo  for perfect specular reflection provides an upper bound to the angular

, where vz is the average vertical velocity and t  is the time

spread is comparable to recent calculations [13] of the rms angular spread D

rms ~ 10 mrad for

finite sized microelectromagnet mirrors with N = 101 wires at optimum current.  In previous

experiments the reported angular spread was 5 mrad for evanescent wave mirrors [16], 6 mrad for

permanent magnet mirrors [6], and 45 mrad for electromagnet mirrors [12].  (3)  Figure 4 also

compares reflected atom cloud widths at various currents from mirrors with even N = 102 and odd

N = 101 numbers of wires.  The only difference between the two mirror configurations came

from energizing the additional wire at the end.  We observe a clear difference in roughness between

the two mirrors, the roughness being lower for odd N = 101.  From Fig. 2 we can see that odd N

mirrors have a larger region of more nearly straight equipotentials than even N mirrors and thus are

expected to be smoother.

Reflection of atoms was also observed from a smaller mirror with active area 2 x 2 mm2

of the serpentine pattern, N = 83, a = 48 m m, w »

 20 m m, and h »

 3 m m.  The mirror resistance

was R = 60 W  at room temperature and R = 20 W

 at ~ 100 K.  For this small mirror the measured

threshold current Ith »

 90 mA is smaller than for the large mirror, due to the stronger fields

produced near wires with smaller cross sectional area and spacing [10].  The threshold estimated

from the computed magnetic field 2.6 mT for Ith at the top of 20 x 3 m m2 rectangular wires using

the Biot-Savart law agrees well with the threshold computed from the atom energy and with the

threshold observed for the larger mirror.  Reflection from this small mirror is difficult to analyze in

more detail, because the atom cloud was comparable in size to the mirror.

In conclusion, we have 1) reflected cold atoms from microelectromagnet mirrors with odd

and even numbers of wires, 2) demonstrated the existence of finite currents which optimize the

reflective mirror properties, and 3) shown that mirrors with an odd number of wires are smoother

than mirrors with an even number of wires.  Improvements of reflective properties might be

possible by adding compensating wires along the edges of mirrors with an odd number of wires to

mimic the field of an ideal infinite mirror [5,12,13,17], by tailoring the wire shape and geometry

[13,14], and by exploiting time-dependent currents.  It is important to note that presently attainable

currents are already sufficient to exceed the current required for minimum roughness as shown in

Fig. 4, and that larger currents are not necessary.  By varying the wire spacing across the width of

the mirror, focusing microelectromagnet mirrors could be realized on flat substrates.  It is

interesting to note that in another area of high magnetic fields, pulsed microcoils have recently

8

achieved fields as high as B ~ 50 T [18], suggesting that microelectromagnet mirrors could also be

useful for more energetic particles.

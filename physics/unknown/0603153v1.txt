Abstract:  The Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method is a novel semi-analytical method jointly 
developed  by  Chongmin  Song  and  John  P  Wolf  to  solve  problems  in  elastodynamics  and  allied 
problems in civil engineering. This novel method has been recently reformulated for the following 
categories  of  problems  in  electromagnetics:  (1)  Determination  of  Eigen  values  of  metallic  cavity 
structures,  2)  Full  wave  analysis  of  Shielded  micro-strip  transmission  line  structures,  and  Very 
Large  Scale  Integrated  Circuit  (VLSI)  interconnects,  and  3)  Full  wave  analysis  of  periodic 
structures. In this paper, a novel Scaled Boundary Finite Element formulation is developed for the 
numerical  simulation  of  the  time  harmonic  electromagnetic  radiation  in  free  space  from  metallic 
structures  of  arbitrary  shape.  The  development  of  the  novel  formulation  necessitates  the 
generalization of the familiar Atkinson-Wilcox radiation series expansion so as to be applicable for 
arbitrary  boundary  circumscribing  the  source  of  radiation.  The  validity  of  the  formulation  is 
demonstrated  by  applying  it  for  common  structures  for  which  the  analytical  and  the  numerically 
simulated results are already known. 
      
Key words: Scaled boundary finite-element method, Time harmonic radiation. 
 
1.  Introduction:  The  Scaled  boundary  finite  element  method  [1,2]  is  a  novel  semi-analytical 

method, jointly developed by Chongmin Song and John P. Wolf of the Institute of Hydraulics and 

Civil  Engineering,  Swiss  Federal  Institute  of  Technology.  It  was  successfully  used  to  solve 

Elastodynamics  and  allied  problems  of  Civil  Engineering  and  soil-structure  interaction  [3].  The 

initial  development  of  the  novel  method  was  based  on  an  approach,  using  the  concept  of 

assemblage  and  similarity  familiar  to  engineers.  The  method  was  then  called  as  the  Consistent 

Infinitesimal Finite- Element cell method [4], reflecting its derivation. Successive developments of 

the  method  led  to  its  reformulation  based  on  the  scaled  boundary  transformation  [1,2].  In  this 

approach,  the  governing  differential  equation  is  transformed  using  a  Galerkin  weighted  residual 

technique.  This  results  in  the  scaled  boundary  finite-element  equation  of  the  problem  [1,2].  This 

method is called the Scaled Boundary Finite Element method.

  This  semi-analytical  method  is  based  entirely  on  finite  elements.  This  paper  is  organized  as 

follows.  The  first  section  deals  with  a  brief  introduction  to  the  scaled  boundary  finite  element 

method. The previous work done by the author, on the reformulation of the scaled boundary finite 

element  method  for  solving  wave-guide  and  cavity  problems  in  electromagnetics  is  mentioned.  It 

also covers the salient features of the methods currently reported in the literature. The advantages of 

the formulation developed in this paper is highlighted. The second section details the concept of the 

scaled  boundary  transformation  of  the  geometry.  The  differential  form  of  the  scaled  boundary 

transformation  equations  are  presented  in  this  section.  The  third  section  deals  with  the  aspects  of 

reformulation  of  the  scaled  boundary  finite  element  method  in  electromagnetics.  In  the  fourth 

section, the theory of the formulation based on the scaled boundary transformation is developed for 

solving the differential equations governing the electromagnetic radiation.  In the fifth section, the 

numerical  implementation  of  the  formulation  developed  in  the  fourth  section  is  carried  out  to 

determine  the  field  pattern  for  a  thin  circular  loop  antenna  carrying  a  sinusoidal  current  along  its 

circumference.  The  results  are  compared  with  those  obtained  from  analytical  approach.  The  sixth 

section summarizes the work done and the future developments.  

     The scaled boundary finite element method, involves discretization only on the boundary of the 

geometry  under  consideration.  Unlike  the  boundary  element  method,  this  method  doesn’t  require 

any fundamental solution to be known in advance. This method  combines  the advantages of  both 

the  finite  and  boundary  element  methods.  This  novel  semi-analytical  method  is  analytical  in  its 

approach along the radial direction with respect to an origin, called as scaling center. It implements 

the finite element method along the tangential direction. 

     The  previous  work  on  the  scaled  boundary  finite  element  method  in  computational 

electromagnetics  [5]  dealt  on  the  aspects  of  reformulation  for  three  categories  of  problems.  They 

are:  1.  Structures  involving  total  confinement  of  the  electromagnetic  field  –  e.g.,  ideal  metallic 

cavity structures, 2. Structures involving transverse confinement but unbounded and uniform along 

 

3 

the  direction  of  wave  propagation–  e.g.,  wave-guides  and  3.  Periodic  structures  –  which  exhibit 

periodicity  in  the  geometric  and/or  material  properties  along  the  axial  co-ordinate-  e.g.,  periodic 

ridged wave-guide, delay lines and filters. A notable feature common to all these three categories of 

structures  is  that  the  electromagnetic  field  possessing  the  desired  characteristics  is  confined  in  a 

finite region of space.  

     Quite  distinct  from  the  class  of  problems  dealt  above,  are  the  phenomena  of  radiation  and 

scattering of electromagnetic field. In either of these, the electromagnetic waves are propagated in 

the unbounded space surrounding the source of radiation or scattering.  

     Before delving further, on the aspects of the reformulation of the scaled boundary finite element 

method for open-boundary problems, the salient features of the finite-element methods reported in 

the current literature is briefly considered.  

     The finite-element based methods that are available for tackling the open boundary problems can 

be  roughly  grouped  into  two  basic  types.  The  methods  belonging  to  the  first  type  are  the  hybrid 

methods in which the finite element and the boundary element method are respectively applied to 

the  bounded  and  the  unbounded  part  of  the  domain  [6].  However  this  approach,  leads  to  dense 

matrices  with  O  (N2)  storage  requirements  [6].  Also  for  problems  involving  large  and  complex 

bodies, it becomes difficult to arrange suitable artificial boundaries over which the Green’s function 

integrals can be applied [6].   

     This limitation is overcome by the second type of methods, which involve the application of the 

asymptotically correct absorbing boundary conditions (ABC’s) to the weighted residual equivalent 

of  the  boundary  value  problem  [6].  The  ABC’s  are  applied  locally  in  differential  form  to  the 

boundary and this gives rise to sparse matrices [6]. This is done in order to truncate the open space 

or a radiation or scattering problem [6].  

     A notable aspect that is to be observed in the first and second type of methods is that they both 

involve  finite  element  discretization  throughout  the  domain  under  consideration.  For  large  and 

 

4 

complex  geometries,  this  involves  considerable  processor  and  memory  resources  resulting  in  a 

significant computation time. Hence there is a need for a method, which retains the advantages of 

the  hybrid  method.  The  method  should  require  fewer  discretization  requirements  and  computing 

resources compared to the conventional hybrid methods. The method should be able to model the 

unbounded  space  exactly  without  the  necessity  to  truncate  it  artificially  by  the  use  of  absorbing 

boundary  conditions.  Moreover,  the  success  of  the  scaled  boundary  finite  element  method  in 

dealing  with  unbounded  media,  was  demonstrated  by  Wolf  and  Chongmin  Song  [7].  The 

development  of  the  numerical  code  based  on  the  generalized  scaled  boundary  finite  element 

formulation of the differential equations governing electromagnetic radiation, enables their solution 

for arbitrarily complex geometries, for which the analytical solutions are impossible. These reasons 

form  the  motivation  for  the  corresponding  reformulation  of  the  scaled  boundary  finite  element 

method for electromagnetics, being the aim of this paper. The forthcoming section deals with the 

concept of the scaled boundary transformation. 

2.  Concept  of  the  scaled  boundary  transformation:    In  order  to  apply  this  method,  a  scaling 

center is first chosen in such a way that the total boundary under consideration is visible from it [1, 

2]. In case of geometries where it is impossible to find such a scaling center, the entire geometry is 

sub-structured [8]. In each sub-structure, the scaling center is independently chosen, and the method 

is applied in each sub-structure. The sub-structures are combined together, which corresponds to the 

analysis of the whole geometry.   

     The concept of the scaled boundary transformation is that, by scaling the boundary in the radial 

direction with respect to a scaling  center O, with a dimensionless numerical factor varying in the 

range from 0 to 1, the whole domain is covered [1,2]. For bounded domains, the upper and lower 

bounds of the scaling factor are 1 and  0 respectively.  For unbounded  domains,  the corresponding 

lower and upper bounds of the scaling factor are 1 and ∞ [1,2] . 

 

5 

     The  figures  (1a)  and  (1b),  shown  in  the  following  page,  illustrate  the  concept  of  the  scaled 

boundary transformation for unbounded and bounded domains respectively [1,2].

                                 with the scaling center inside the  
                                 medium(section).  
 

     The  scaling  applies  to  each  surface  finite  element.  Its  discretized  surface  on  the  boundary  is 

denoted as Se (superscript e for element). Continuous scaling of the element yields a pyramid with 

volume Ve. The scaling center O is at its apex.  

     The  base  of  the  pyramid  is  the  surface  finite  element.  The  sides  of  the  pyramid  forming  the 

boundary  Ae  follow  from  connecting  the  curved  edge  of  the  surface  finite  element  to  the  scaling 

center by straight lines. No discretization of Ae occurs. Assembling all the pyramids by connecting 

their  sides  corresponds  to  enforcing  compatibility  and  equilibrium  conditions.  This  results  in  the 

total  medium  with  volume  V  and  the  closed  boundary  S.  No  boundaries  Ae  passing  through  the 

scaling  center  remain.  Mathematically,  the  scaling  corresponds  to  a  transformation  of  the 

coordinates  for  each  finite  element.  This  results  in  two  curvilinear  local  coordinates  along  the 

tangential  directions  and  a  single  dimensionless  radial  coordinate  representing  the  scaling  factor. 

This  transformation  becomes  unique  due  to  the  choice  of  the  scaling  center  from  which  the  total 

boundary of the geometry is visible [1,2]. The key advantages of this method [1,2] are:  

a)  The finite-element discretization is to be performed only on the reduced spatial dimension of the

satisfied.  

     The  scaled  boundary  transformation  is  basically  a  relation  between  the  derivatives  in  the 

cartesian  coordinates  and  the  derivatives  expressed  in  the  scaled  boundary  variables  [1,2].  The 

three-dimensional scaled boundary transformation of the geometry is considered in brief. The figure 

shown below, depicts the scaled boundary transformation of the geometry shown in Fig.(1a).

In Fig.(2a), a specific finite element is addressed . The coordinates on the doubly-curved boundary 

are denoted as x, y, z. A point on the boundary is described by its position vector 

 
r =  x i + y j + z k                                                                                                                           (2.1)

boundary.  In  a  practical  application,  the  geometry  of  the  boundary  is  so  general  that  only  a 

piecewise description is feasible. Accordingly, doubly-curved surface finite elements are used. 

     The  geometry  of  this  finite  element  on  the  boundary  is  represented  by  interpolating  its  nodal 

coordinates {x},{y},{z} using the local coordinates η,ζ.

The LHS of  (2.7) correspond to the derivatives in cartesian coordinates. The RHS of (2.7) contain 

the derivatives in the scaled boundary coordinates. The symbols gξ, gη, and gζ in (2.8) correspond to 

the outward normal vectors to the boundary surfaces (η,ς), (ς,ξ), (ξ,η) where the coordinates ξ, η, 

ς, respectively are constant [1,2]. On the boundary, the radial scaled boundary variable ξ equals 1 

[1,2]. The symbols nξ, nη, and nζ in (2.9) correspond to the unit normalized vectors gξ, gη, and gζ 

respectively  [1,2].  In  (2.10),  |δ|  corresponds  to  the  surface  discretization  factor  introduced  by  the 

scaled boundary transformation of the  geometry. This term depends only on the tangential scaled 

boundary coordinates η and ζ. [1,2]    

3.  The  scaled  boundary  finite-element  method  in  electromagnetics:  The  scaled  boundary 

transformation equations are quite general. It can be applied to differential equations governing the 

phenomena  in  any  discipline.  This  feature  of  the  scaled  boundary  transformations  is  used  in  the 

reformulation of the novel method for electromagnetics [5]. However, the actual formulation of the 

scaled boundary finite-element equation depends upon the additional constraints that are specific to 

the  discipline,  which  are  to  be  satisfied.  This  approach  ensures  that,  the  scaled  boundary  finite-

element  equation  takes  into  account,  the  specific  features  of  that  discipline.  Hence,  a  closest 

possible representation of the system, represented by the original differential equations along with 

the constraints in the form of boundary conditions, is achieved.  

     In 

this  context,  when 

the  scaled  boundary  finite-element  method 

is  reformulated 

in 

electromagnetics in H formulation, it is necessary that apart from satisfying the essential boundary 

conditions,  the  fields  should  satisfy  the  solenoidality  property  of  the  magnetic  field  [5].  This 

condition should be necessarily incorporated while formulating the scaled boundary finite-element 

equation  in  electromagnetics  [5].  This  is  necessary  so  that  no  spurious  solutions  occur  as  eigen 

solutions  of  the  boundary  value  problem  [5].  Apart  from  the  necessary  implementation  of  the 

solenoidality of the magnetic field, the radiation problems involving the electromagnetic potentials 

 

10 

require an additional constraint that is to be satisfied. The constraint is that the curl of the gradient 

of  the  scalar  electromagnetic  potential  should  also  be  equal  to  zero.  Moreover,  for  problems

[9], in the scaled boundary finite element equations.

     The retarded time t’ is related to the time t taken by the electromagnetic field with a velocity c, 

to reach a point R in free space from the source of radiation, by the following relation. 

                                                                                                                                                          (4.3.1)

(4.4)

The differential equations (4.1,4.2 & 4.4) are valid for every point in space surrounding the source 

of  radiation.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  source  terms  in  (4.1)  and  (4.2)  are  in  fact  functions  of 

retarded  time  t’  [10].  Hence,  for  time  harmonic  variation  given  by

,  the  source  terms  are 

multiplied  by  a  phase  factor  given  by 

e

.  This  accounts  for  the  time  taken  by  the

electromagnetic wave to reach the point of observation in free space from the point on the source of 

radiation. For developing the scaled boundary finite-element model, the first step is the formulation 

of  a  suitable  weighted  residual  form  of  the  differential  equations  (4.1)  and  (4.2).    Hence,  the 

weighted  residual  formulation  of  Eq.(4.1)  is  developed  as  a  first  step.  The  following  conventions 

are used in the development of the scaled boundary finite-element formulation. 

Ωsp denotes the domain comprising unbounded free space surrounding the source of radiation.  

Ωρ denotes the domain comprising the non-zero source charge density. 

Ω = Ωρ + Ωsp , denotes the overall domain in which the radiation differential equations along with 

the source charge and current density are defined. 

   Using the above mentioned conventions and multiplying (4.1) on both sides by a non-zero weight 

function  ‘W’  and  integrating  over  the  domain  Ω,  while  including  the  phase  factor  for  the  source

       For  the  development  of  an  appropriate  scaled  boundary  finite  element  model  for  problems 

involving  electromagnetic  radiation,  it  is  necessary  to  obtain  the  representation  of  the 

electromagnetic  fields  and  potentials  in  terms  of  a  generalized  vector  series  expansion.  This 

expansion  should  be  expressed  in  terms  of  the  scaled  boundary  variables  and  should  satisfy  the 

radiation condition. This is achieved by the generalization of the Atkinson-Wilcox radiation series 

expansion [11].  

     The Atkinson-Wilcox radiation series expansion states that, any outgoing radiating field R can 

be  expanded  in  the  free  space  surrounding  the  sphere  circumscribing  the  source  of  radiation  or 

scatterer in terms of spherical polar co-ordinates as [11]

     In  the  above  equation,  the  exponential  term  denotes  the  outgoing  propagation  term  of  the 

radiating field. The first inverse distance term corresponding to n=0 is the radiation field. This term 

dominates at longer distance from the source of the radiation or scattering.  This term is also called 

as  the  far-field  term.  The  far  field  term  contributes  to  the  out  ward  flow  of  the  radiated 

electromagnetic  energy.  The  term  corresponding  to  n=1  is  the  induction  field  and  it  dominates  at 

distances close to the source of radiation or scattering. This term is called as the near field term. The 

terms  involving  higher  powers  of  the  inverse  distance  constitute  the  higher  order  field  terms.  By 

virtue of the representation, the expansion given in (4.15) satisfies the radiation condition. 

          In  (4.15), r is the  radial variable and  θ,φ   are the tangential variables in the spherical polar 

coordinates. The subsequent generalization to the scaled boundary coordinates is obtained by noting 

that the role played by the radial variable ‘r’ in the spherical polar coordinates is analogous to the 

dimensionless radial variable ‘ξ’ in the scaled boundary coordinate. The tangential variables θ,φ  in 

spherical polar coordinates are analogous to the tangential variables η and ζ in the scaled boundary 

coordinate.  Also,  the  term  Rn  in  (4.15)  is  the  vector  written  in  terms  of  the  ortho-normal  basis 

 

15 

vectors of the spherical  polar coordinates [11]. This term can be re-written in terms of the ortho-

normal basis vectors of the scaled boundary coordinates. Moreover, the recent generalization of the 

Atkinson-Wilcox expansions for ellipsoidal geometry [12] has the similar form expressed in (4.15). 

The only change is that the tangential spherical polar coordinates (θ,φ) in (4.15) is changed to the 

tangential ellipsoidal coordinates (µ,ν) [12].  Similar feature is observed in the recent generalization 

of the expansion in electromagnetics for chiral materials [13].  

     From  these  observations,  the  expression  in  (4.15)  is  generalized  for  the  scaled  boundary 

coordinates as

 are scalar components of those ortho-normal vectors. These ortho-

normal vectors in the scaled boundary coordinate system,   are related to the Cartesian coordinate 

system by the relations given in (2.9). 

     The key to the development of the scaled boundary finite-element formulation is that, the semi-

analytical feature of the scaled boundary finite element method permits piecewise application of the 

generalized  Wilcox  expansion.  This  enables  the  generalized  expansion  given  in  (4.16)  to  be 

applicable  for  arbitrary  geometries,  retaining  the  flexibility  of  the  finite  element  method.  In  this 

context, the terms involving the scaled boundary variables η and ζ are given in terms of the finite-

element  interpolation  functions  expressed  in  terms  of  the  scaled  boundary  variables.  In  practical 

numerical computations, the upper limit of n in (4.16) will be some positive integer m. 

16 

 

 

      Having  obtained  the  generalized  radiation  series  expansion,  the  next  step  is  to  obtain  the 

equations  of  constraint  in  terms  of  the  scaled  boundary  variables.  These  equations  of  constraint 

expressed  in  terms  of  the  scaled  boundary  variables,  facilitate  their  implementation  for  arbitrary 

geometries. The constraints are as follows. 

1.  The  magnetic field should be solenoidal. 

2.  The curl of the gradient of the scalar potential should be zero. 

3.  The essential boundary condition that the total tangential electric field on the surface of the 

perfect conductor should be zero. 

     As  a  first  step,  the  expression  for  the  solenoidality  condition  in  terms  of  the  scaled  boundary 

variables  is  derived  forthwith.  As  mentioned  earlier  in  the  paper,  the  implementation  of  the 

solenoidality  of  the  magnetic  field  is  essential  in  order  to  prevent  spurious  modes  in  the  eigen 

spectrum. To this end, The solenoidality property of the magnetic field is given by,

    The equations given in (4.21) express the solenoidality property of the magnetic field expressed 

in terms of the scaled boundary variables and the unknown coefficients of the generalized Wilcox 

expansion for the vector potential. The constraint equations (4.21) are valid for every point in the 

unbounded domain surrounding the source of radiation.  

    Having  obtained  the  constraint  equations  for  the  vector  potential,  the  next  step  is  to  obtain  the 

constraint equations for the scalar potential.  

From vector analysis, it is known that for any sufficiently differentiable non-zero scalar,

Using (2.7) and (4.26), Eq.(4.23) is written in terms of the scaled boundary variables in Cartesian 

coordinates.  Using  the  fact  that  the  resulting  equation  holds  independent  of  the  radial  scaled 

boundary  variable  ξ,  the  following  equations  are  obtained.  These  equations  are  expressed  in  a 

concise manner through matrix notation.

     Having  obtained  the  constraint  equation  for  the  scalar  potential,  the  next  step  is  the 

implementation of the equation of continuity relating the charge density and the current density.  

     For  electromagnetic  radiations  from  metallic  surfaces  at  high  frequencies,  the  currents  are 

essentially  confined  only  to  the  surface  of  the  conductor.  Hence  the  divergence  term  in  the 

continuity  equation  is  essentially  restricted  only  to  the  surface  of  the  conductor.  Under  thus 

condition, the equation of continuity mentioned in (4.3) is written as,

                                                    (4.28) 

where, Js and ρs correspond to the surface current density and surface charge density respectively. 

The  notation 

⋅∇ s   denotes  that  the  divergence  operation  is  confined  only  to  the  surface  of  the 

conductor.   

Moreover, on the surface of a perfect conductor [9],

where Hs denotes the total tangential magnetic field on the surface of the conductor. 

sn is the unit 

normal vector pointing outwards from the surface of the perfect conductor. 

sH  can be written as a 

vector  sum  of  the  tangential  components  of  the  external  magnetic  field

Rewriting  (4.29)  using  (4.29a)  and  the  generalized  Atkinson-Wilcox  expansion  for

(2.9a) for

The  form  of  the  relation  given  in  (4.30a)  implies  that  the  surface  current  density,  possess  only 

tangential components, as required by the theory. 

     The  appropriate  scaled  boundary  transformation  is  obtained  by  substituting  ξ=1  in  (2.7)  and 

omitting  the  derivative  term  containing  the  radial  variable  ξ  in  the  generalized  three-dimensional 

scaled  boundary  transformation.  The  reason  being,  on  the  surface  of  the  conductor,  ξ=1  and  the 

finite element interpolation functions are independent of ξ. This results in the following modified 

surface scaled boundary transformations.

(4.31)

     To  derive  the  constraint  equations  for  implementing  the  equation  of  continuity,  Eq.(4.28)  is 

written  in  terms  of  the  scaled  boundary  variables  by  using  (4.31).  The  relation  given  in  (4.30)  is 

used in conjunction with (4.28) so as to obtain an appropriate expression for 

s ρ . This results in a 

matrix expression for the equation of continuity of the form given below in (4.32).

                               (4.32) 

     The expression given in (4.32) is the piecewise representation of the equation of continuity to be 

implemented  for  every  surface  finite  element.  This  fact  is  further  stressed  by  the  presence  of  the 

surface  discretization  factor  on  the  denominator  on  the  L.H.S  of  (4.32).  The  expressions  for  the 

derivatives  of  the  current  density  components  with  respect  to  the  tangential  scaled  boundary 

variables are given as follows.

        (4.33e) 

          (4.33f) 

     The set of equations (4.32,4.33a-f) represent the relation between the surface charge density ρs 

and  the  surface  current  density  Js.  The  resulting  expression  for  the  surface  charge  density  is 

substituted in the functional for the scalar potential.  

     The  significance  of  the  relations  given  in  (4.32-4.33  a-f)  can  be  understood  as  follows.  The 

equations (4.32-4.33) ensure that the equation of continuity between the surface charge and current 

densities  are  satisfied.  This  further  ensures  that  the  Lorentz  gauge  between  electromagnetic 

potentials  A  and  V  is  also  satisfied,  as  required  by  the  theory.  The  non-zero  divergence  of  the 

current density is necessary so as to ensure the prevention of the accumulation of charges along the 

edges [14].

    As mentioned earlier in the paper, the scaled boundary finite element method is analytical in the 

radial direction with respect to the scaling center and implements the finite element method along 

the  tangential  directions.  Moreover,  the  solution  of  the  scalar  potential  equation  by  the  scaled 

boundary finite element method requires an appropriate form for the scalar potential V, as observed 

from Eq.(4.6). Hence it is necessary to obtain an appropriate analytical expression for V along the 

radial direction. This is done as follows. 

     The expressions listed in (4.26) represent the gradient of the scalar potential along the x, y, and z 

axes respectively. These expressions serve to derive the appropriate form of the scalar potential V.                   

     The total differential of the scalar potential V in Cartesian coordinates is given by

Substituting (4.26) in (4.34) and integrating, the following expression for V is obtained, in terms of 

the scaled boundary variables.

In Eq.(4.35),the superscript ‘T’ denotes the operation of the transpose of the matrix. 

     Having obtained the appropriate form of the scalar potential along the radial direction, the next 

step  is  to  obtain  a  corresponding  analytical  form  for  the  vector  potential  A  along  the  radial 

direction, as observed from (4.14). This is achieved as follows.

    The vector potential A is represented in terms of the ortho-normal vectors of the scaled boundary 

coordinate system as,

Using the scaled boundary transformation given in (2.7), the above equation is written in terms of 

the  scaled  boundary  variables.  Using  (2.7),  (4.16),  (4.36),  (4.37),  (4.38),  the  R.H.S  of  (4.12)  is 

transformed  into  a  representation  in  terms  of  Cartesian  components  by  the  scaled  boundary 

variables. Comparing these two expressions of  A2∇  for each Cartesian component leads to an in-

homogenous  Cauchy  -  Euler  type  differential  equation  in  terms  of  the  radial  variable  ξ.  The 

typical form of the differential equation for an x component of  A2∇  is given by,

     The  first  term  on  the  R.H.S  of  (4.41)  accounts  for  the  lorentz  gauge  condition  being 

implemented inherently in the formulation.

 As a first step in obtaining the solution of (4.40) for 

, the differential equation in rewritten 

( )ξxA

in terms of a dimensionless variable τ through the transformation given by                                                                             

ξ =  eτ                                                                                                                                           (4.42) 

The change of variable given in (4.42) transforms (4.40) into a standard Cauchy-Euler differential 

equation in τ with the corresponding in-homogenous term on the R.H.S. The form of the differential 

equation after applying (4.42) on (4.40) is given by,

The  solution  sought  for  the  differential  equation  in  (4.43)  should  be  square-integrable  in  the 

unbounded domain as per the physical requirement. Under this condition, the solution is obtained 

by using the Fourier Transform. Applying Fourier Transform to both sides of (4.43) with respect to 

τ, and using ατ as the Fourier transform variable, the following expression is obtained.

The  complete  analytical  solution  to  the  differential  equation  given  in  (4.43)  is  obtained  by  using 

(4.46d - 4.46g) in  (4.46). It is evident from (4.46) that the geometrical factors denoted by 

1ψ and 

2ψ and the number of terms in the radial series expansion of the vector potential contribute to the 

poles of the spatial Fourier transform of the vector potential. 

 

36 

     Similar  expressions  exist  for  all  the  other  components  of  A.  Using  these  expressions  in 

conjunction  with  (4.37)  and  (4.38),  provide  the  complete  semi-analytical  representation  of  A 

suitable for the scaled boundary finite-element solution of the problem. 

     The  physical  significance  of  the  methodology  followed  above  can  be  understood  in  the 

following  way.  The  in-homogenous  term  on  the  R.H.S  of    (4.40)  consists  of  two  parts.  The  first 

term consists of the Lorentz gauge relating the scalar and the vector potentials. The second term is 

the curl of the magnetic field, which satisfies the radiation condition. These two terms act as forcing 

functions, so as to determine the form of the vector potential A.   

     The resulting vector potential A, obtained as an explicit solution of such a differential equation 

ensures that the physical fields based on the electromagnetic potentials, indeed satisfy the physical 

requirements of the problem.  

    For problems involving electromagnetic radiation in free space from arbitrary metallic surfaces, 

the essential boundary condition that is to be satisfied is that the total tangential electric field on the 

surface  of  an  ideal  metallic  surface  be  zero.  This  essential  boundary  condition  is  apart  from  the 

equation  of  continuity  being  satisfied  by  the  surface  charge  and  the  current  densities  and  the 

Lorentz  gauge  being  satisfied  by  the  electromagnetic  potentials.  Appropriate  constraint  equations 

for enforcing this essential boundary condition is derived forthwith.    

     If ns denote the unit normal vector to the metallic surface S, and 

TotE  denote the total tangential 

electric field on the metallic surface S, then the essential boundary condition on the metallic surface 

is represented by,

Hence, (4.51) is written as, 

                                                       (4.51) 

The total tangential electric field on the metallic surface is the sum of the tangential component of 

the scattered electric field 

ScaE  and the tangential component of the external source field 

ExtE .

     In  order  to  obtain  the  equivalent  of  the  essential  boundary  condition  in  scaled  boundary 

coordinates,  the  expression  given  in  (4.24)  is  substituted  for  V∇   and  the  expressions  given  in 

(4.41)  is  substituted  for  A  in  (4.54).  Also  ξ=1  is  substituted  to  confine  the  essential  boundary 

condition on the surface of the conductor. Simplifying the resulting expression results in a matrix

     In the equations  (4.56c, 4.56f, 4.56i), the terms 

ext
xE  

 Eext

y   ext

zE  represent the scalar part of the 

x y and z components of the external electric field respectively. Physically, these terms represent the 

contribution of the feeds to the surface current density in an antenna system. The equation given in 

(4.55)  together  with  the  expressions  given  in  (4.56  a-i)  are  the  equivalent  constraints  in  scaled 

boundary variables representing the essential boundary condition.  

     The constraint equations derived so far, are implemented in the scaled boundary finite element 

functional  given  in  (4.8)  and  (4.14),  by  the  method  of  Lagrange  multipliers  [15]  in  the  following 

way. The constraint for the scalar vector potential given in (4.27) is added as the terms involving 

 

39 

the Lagrange multipliers to the functional given in  (4.8). The constraints given in (4.21) and (4.55) 

are added likewise to the functional for the vector potential given in (4.14).  

     Some  important  features  of  the  formulation  are  worth  noting.  The  formulation  contains  two 

functionals - a scalar potential functional and a vector potential functional. Both the functionals are 

to be implemented in the same geometry for which the radiation pattern is sought. The external field 

which appears in the essential boundary condition, is accounted as the term involving the Lagrange 

multiplier in the vector potential functional. The solenoidality of the magnetic field is accounted as 

the  second  term  involving  another  set  of  Lagrange  multipliers  added  to  the  vector  potential 

functional. The practical implementation of the formulation is done by the following procedure. 

     The  geometry  under  consideration  is  meshed  on  its  surface  by  using  surface  finite  elements. 

Also,  an  appropriate  scaling  center  is  chosen.  The  finite  element  implementation  of  the  scalar 

functional along with the appropriate Lagrange multiplier terms as constraints is first performed on 

the meshed geometry. This process results in the gradient of the scalar potential as output. This is 

followed by the finite element implementation of the vector potential functional. The gradient of the 

scalar  functional  obtained  as  output  is  substituted  in  the  appropriate  term  in  the  vector  potential 

functional,  during  the  course  of  its  evaluation.  The  resulting  output  of  the  finite  element 

implementation ensures the total solution of the problem.

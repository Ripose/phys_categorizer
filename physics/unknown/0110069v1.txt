Abstract.  A  brief  history  is  given  of  the  factor  2,  starting  in  the  most  elementary 
considerations of geometry and the kinematics of uniform acceleration, and moving to 
relativity, quantum  mechanics and particle physics. The basic argument is that in all 
the  significant  cases  in  which  the  factor  2  or  ½  occurs  in  fundamental  physics, 
whether classical, quantum or relativistic, the same physical operation is taking place. 
 
1 Geometry and kinematics 
 
We probably first come across the factor 2 in the formula for the triangle: 
 

       area = 

length of base × perpendicular height
2

 . 

 
This  is  an  ancient  formula,  well-known  to  Egyptian,  Babylonian  and  Chinese 
mathematicians.  In  the  case  of  a  right-angled  triangle,  it  is  clearly  created  by 
bissecting a rectangle along a diagonal. If we now take this as representing a straight-
line graph, of, say, velocity against time, under a uniform acceleration, the area under 
the  graph  becomes  the  distance  travelled.  For  an  object  increasing  its  velocity 
uniformly from 0 to a value v in time interval t, the area under the graph, or distance 
travelled, using the triangle formula, becomes vt / 2. By comparison, if the object had 
travelled at steady speed v throughout the time interval t, the distance travelled would 
be  the  area  of  the  rectangle  under  the  horizontal  straight  line  representing  steady  v, 
that  is,  vt.  In  effect,  the  factor  2  distinguishes  here  between  steady  conditions  and 
steadily changing conditions. 

It  was  by  this  means  that  the  factor  first  entered  into  physics  from  pure 
mathematics,  via  the  Merton  mean  speed  theorem,  evolved  in  fourteenth-century 
Oxford. This result, which ultimately proved to be the foundation theorem of modern 
dynamics,  showed  that  the  total  distance  moved  by  a  body  during  uniform 
acceleration  was  the  same  as  that  covered  during  the  same  time  interval  by  a  body 
travelling  uniformly  at  the  speed  measured  at  the  middle  instant  of  the  accelerated 
motion. In more modern terms, the total distance travelled under uniform acceleration 
must  equal  the  product  of  the  mean  speed  and  the  time.  Mathematically,  if  we  start 
with initial speed u and steadily accelerate to a final speed v over the time interval t, 
then the total distance travelled will be given by

 . 

 
This is, of course, identical to the value we would obtain from our straight line graph 
if we took the area under the graph between u and v as the sum of a rectangle (ut) and 
a triangle ((v – u) t / 2), and reduces to vt / 2 when u = 0. 

If  we additionally  use the definition of uniform acceleration,  a = (v –  u) /  t, we 

obtain the well-known equation for uniformly accelerated motion: 
 

                  v2 = u2 + 2as , 

 
which  reduces  to  v2  =  2as,  when  u  =  0.  If  we  now  apply  this  to  a  body  of  mass  m, 
acted on by a uniform force F = ma, we find the work done over distance s is equal to 
the kinetic energy gained

         ⌡⌠
 

 
which  reduces  to  mv2  /  2  if  we  start  at  zero  speed.  Using  p  =  mv  to  represent 
momentum,  it  is  convenient  also  to  express  this  formula  in  the  form  p2  /  2m.  Of 
course,  this  formula  applies  more  generally  than  in  the  case  of  purely  uniformly 
accelerated  motion,  and  we  may  derive  the  more  general  formula  for  nonuniformly 
accelerated motion by a simple integration of force (dp / dt) over displacement: 
 
 
dp
dt   ds = ⌡⌠
  
 
 
However,  the  example  of  uniform  acceleration,  treated  graphically,  shows,  in  a 
strikingly simple manner, the origin of the factor of 2 in a process of averaging over 
changing conditions. In this context, the factor 2 relates together the two main areas of 
dynamical  physics:  those  of  accelerated  and  unaccelerated  straight  line  motion.  For 
the case of zero initial velocity, the distance travelled under uniform acceleration can 
be  represented  as  the  area  of  a  triangle  on  a  v-t  graph  compared  with  the  rectangle 
representing  uniform  velocity.  In  effect,  a  steady  increase  of  velocity  from  0  to  v 
requires  an  averaging  out  which  halves  the  values  obtained  under  steady-state 
conditions. 
 
2 Kinetic and potential energy 
 
It  is  in  precisely  the  same  way  that  the  factor  2  makes  its  appearance  in  molecular 
thermodynamics,  quantum  theory  and  relativity.  It  is,  in  a  sense,  the  factor  which 
relates the continuous aspect of physics to the discrete, and, as both these aspects are 
required  in  the  description  of  any  physical  system,  the  factor  acquires  a  universal

relevance.  The  most  obvious  classical  manifestation  is  the  fact  that  two  types  of 
energy equation are commonly used in physics, both of which are expressions of the 
general law of conservation of energy, but each of which expresses this fundamental 
truth  in  a  subtly  different  way.  One  is  the  potential  energy  equation  representing 
steady-state  conditions,  which  applies  wherever  there  is  no  overall  change  in  the 
energy  distribution;  the  kinetic  energy  equation,  on  the  other  hand,  requires  a 
redistribution  of  energy  within  a  system  while  maintaining  the  overall  principle  of 
energy conservation. 

In  a  typical  example,  we  apply  the  potential  energy  equation  to  the  case  of  a 

planet in a regular gravitational orbit. So, the force equation 

 

mv2
r   = – 

GMm
r2

 

 

  

                  

 
 
leads to a potential energy relation 
 
 
 
On the other hand, the changing conditions involved in the escape of a body of mass 
m from a gravitational field require a kinetic energy equation of the form 
 
 
 

       mv2 = –

Significantly,  Newton,  despite  having  no  word  or  expression  equivalent  to  the 
modern term ‘energy’ or to any particular form of it, used both these equations in his 
Principia,  in  the  more  general  forms  applicable  to  any  force.1  Book  I,  Proposition 
XLI,  a  version  of  what  came  to  be  known  as  the  ‘vis  viva’  integral,  is  applied  to 
finding  the  paths  taken  by  bodies  subject  to  any  type  of  centripetal  force;  this  is  a 
classic case of the potential energy equation. Proposition XXXIX, on the other hand, 
which considers the velocity of a rising or falling body produced by the action of an 
arbitrary  force,  is  a  kinetic  energy  equation,  showing  that  the  work  done,  or  the 
integral of force over distance, in unresisted motion, is equal to the change in kinetic 
energy produced (D W = D (mv2 / 2)). 

Numerically, we observe that the potential energy term is twice the value of the 
kinetic. We recognise here, of course, that this is a special case of the virial theorem 
relating  the  time-averaged  potential  and  kinetic  energies,  V
,  in  a  conservative 
system governed by force terms inversely proportional to power n of the distance, or 
potential energy terms inversely proportional to power n – 1. That is: 
 
 
 
The virial theorem, in effect, gives us a relationship between the energy term relevant

  will  be  numerically  equal  to  2T

to constant conditions (potential energy) and that obtained under conditions of change 
(kinetic energy). For two special cases – constant force and inverse-square-law force 
,  for in these cases  n is, respectively, equal to 0 
–  V
and 2. Such forces, in fact, are overwhelmingly predominant in nature, as they are a 
natural  consequence  of  three-dimensional  space.  In  many  cases,  then,  the  factor  2 
becomes  the  direct  expression  of  the  relationship  between  potential  and  kinetic 
energies. 
 
3 Kinetic theory of gases 
 

The fact that two apparently contradictory equations can both be said to illustrate 
the  general  principle  of  the  conservation  of  energy  can  be  easily  explained  if  we 
consider the kinetic energy relation to be concerned with the action side of Newton’s 
third  law,  while  the  potential  energy  relation  concerns  both  action  and  reaction. 
Because of the necessary relation between them, each of these approaches is a proper 
and  complete  expression  of  the  conservation  of  energy.  However,  circumstances 
generally dictate which of the two is the most appropriate to use. A good illustration 
of  the  connection  is  given  by  an  old  proof  of  Newton’s  of  the  mv2  /  r  law  for 
centripetal force, and hence of the formula mv2 for orbital potential energy.2 This had 
the  satellite  object  being  ‘reflected’  off  the  circle  of  the  orbit,  first  in  a  square 
formation, and then in a polygon with an increasing number of sides, becoming, in the 
limiting  case,  a  circle.  Here,  the  momentum-doubling  action  and  reaction  by  the 
imagined  physical  reflection  produces  the  potential  energy  formula,  as  well  as 
demonstrating  the  relation  between  the  conservation  laws  of  linear  and  angular 
momentum. 

Another significant case is the derivation of Boyle’s law, or the proportionality of 
pressure  (P)  and  density  ((cid:0) )  in  an  ideal  gas,  from  what  is  often  described  as  the 
‘kinetic’ theory. Contrary to what is often stated in elementary textbooks, the kinetic 
behaviour  of  gas  molecules  is  in  no  direct  way  responsible  for  Boyle’s  law.  The 
derivation involves a doubling of momentum as the ideal gas molecules reflect off the 
walls  of  the  container,  of  the  same  kind  as  Newton  assumed  in  his  imaginary 
reflections  under  centripetal  acceleration.  The  factor  2  thus  introduced  is  then 
immediately removed by the fact that we have to calculate the average time between 
collisions (t = 2a / v) as the time taken to travel twice the length of the container (a). 
The average  force  then becomes the momentum change / time = 2 mv / t = mv2 / a, 
and the pressure due to one molecule in a cubical container of side a becomes mv2 / 
a3, or mv2 / V (volume), leading for n molecules to the pressure-density relationship. 

 The  incorporation  of  momentum-doubling  means  that  both  action  and  reaction 
are  included  in  the  system  under  consideration,  thereby  creating  a  steady-state 
dynamics with positions of molecules constant on a time-average. Taking into account 
the  three  dimensions  between  which  the  velocity  is  distributed, the ratio of pressure 

 

4

-
-
 

 

and density  (P / (cid:0) )  is  derived from the potential energy term mv2 for each molecule 
and is equal to one third of the average of the squared velocity, or c

- 2 / 3. 

Strictly  speaking,  this  result  has  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  any  dynamical 
model of gas molecule behaviour. Newton derived exactly the same result, assuming, 
for  purely  mathematical  purposes,3  that  gas  molecules  could  be  considered  as 
stationary  objects  exerting  a  repulsive  outward  force  on  each  other  in  inverse 
proportional  proportion  to  their  distance  apart,  and  a  gas  in  steady  state  exerts  a 
pressure in all directions which is exactly the same as the molecules being considered 
stationary on a time average and exerting a force inversely proportional to their mean 
distance apart, or, for a fixed mass of gas, to the length of the container. (It is not, of 
course,  necessary  to  assume  that  this  is  due  to  a  physical  interaction  between  the 
molecules.) 

We only bring in kinetic behaviour when we relate the average kinetic energy of 
the  molecules  to  the  temperature  of  the  gas;  but  there  is  no  ‘derivation’  involved 
because temperature is not defined independently of the kinetic energy, and we make 
this  definition  by  an  explicit  use  of  the  virial  theorem,  to  find  the  unknown  average 
kinetic energy from the known potential energy. We find that the potential energy of 
each  individual  molecule  is  kT  for  each  degree  of  freedom,  and,  in  total,  3kT. 
However,  by  applying  the  virial  theorem  to  the  results  of  the  potential  energy 
calculations,  we  can  relate  the  dynamical  behaviour  of  an  ideal  gas  to  the  kinetic 
energy  expression  (3kT  /  2)  for  its  individual  molecules.  In  effect,  the  derivation  of 
Boyle’s  law  assuming  dynamical  gas  molecules  was  merely  an  operational 
convenience; for pressure terms of any kind, whatever their origin, are an expression 
of the action of force or potential energy. That is, it is a purely formal matter whether 
we describe the gas in terms of the average kinetic energy of the individual molecules 
or an equivalent averaged-out potential energy of the gas as a whole. A gas in steady 
state  is  equivalent  to  a  system  with  constant  expansive  force in  all directions, and a 
system of this kind necessarily requires a virial relation of the form 
 
 
 
between the time-averaged potential and kinetic energies.

It  is  interesting,  incidentally,  that  Newton’s  earliest  derivation  of  the centripetal 
force  law  (mv2  /  r)  (prior  to  the  geometrical  proof  discussed  above)2  involved 
essentially the same collision process (involving aether particles) as is now used in the 
kinetic  theory  of  gases,  with  force  calculated  as  the  product  of  the  change  in 
momentum in a particle due to impact and the rate at which collisions take place, the 
collision  rate  being  found  by  dividing  the  particle  velocity  by  the  distance  travelled 
between collisions.

4 Radiation pressure 
 
Consideration of material gases leads us on to the subject of photon ‘gases’, as first 
considered by Einstein in deriving radiation pressure, following the earlier, classical, 
calculation by Boltzmann. Remarkably, the expressions for photon gases are identical 
in form to those for material gases, even though the photon gas is a relativistic system, 
unlike  the  material  gas.  In  exact  parallel  to  the  expression  for  a  material  gas,  the 
radiation pressure of a photon gas within a fixed enclosure is found to be one third of 
the energy density of radiation, that is:

3 (cid:0)  c2  . 

           P = 

 

 

In this context, the photon behaves in exactly the same way as a material particle, and, 
because  the  system  is  in  steady  state,  the  energy  term  mc2  behaves  as  potential,  not 
kinetic,  energy,  exactly  as  its  form  would  suggest.  The photons are  reflected off the 
walls  of  the  container  in  the  same  way  as  the  material  gas  molecules,  although  this 
time we can also consider the process as involving absorption and re-emission, There 
is thus no mysterious ‘relativistic’ factor at work here – as suggested by some authors 
who see mc2 for the photon as a ‘kinetic’ energy replacing the term mv2 / 2 used for 
material  particles;  mc2  is  simply  a  reflection  of  the  potential  nature  of  the  photon’s 
total energy. 

The  whole  point  of  Einstein’s  introduction  of  the  formula  E  =  mc2  to  represent 
the  photon’s  total  energy  (and,  by  analogy,  that  of  true  material  particles)  was  to 
preserve  the  classical  laws  of  conservation  of  mass  and  conservation  of  energy.  As 
Einstein himself was well aware, the total energy equation E = mc2 cannot be derived, 
by deductive means, from the postulates of relativity; all that can be demonstrated is 
the  change  of  energy  formula  D E  =  D mc2.  It  is  merely  an  act of faith to extend this 
formula to the more general expression. This is because the total energy term occurs 
only as a constant of arbitrary value in the integration of the relativistic expression for 
rate of energy change: 
 
 
 
In  addition,  the  presence  of  mc2  in  the  relativistic  kinetic  energy  equation,  which 
emerges as the solution to this integral: 
 
 
 
 
 

mc2
(1 – v2 / c2)1/2

dT
dt   = F.v  . 

    = mc2 + 

 + ...    

          

 T = 

 

 

 

 

 

contradicts  the  well-established  principle  that  special  relativistic  equations  lead  to 
classical ones when v « c. In principle, we could add any constant of integration to the 

 

6

 

 

equation.  Adding  mc2,  for  example,  would  remove  the  anomalous  term  entirely  and 
make the expression, for v « c, identical with the classical one, as would normally be 
required. It has been found convenient, in relativity, however, to take the constant of 
integration as 0, because this allows a convenient definition of a 4-vector momentum, 
and then to find a ‘physical’ meaning for the added term mc2. 

Writers  who  have  investigated  Einstein’s  own  arguments  and  who  demonstrate 
the validity of his derivation of the equation D E = D mc2 point to the arbitrary, though 
physically  reasonable,  nature  of  its  extension  to  a  body’s  total  mass.  Stachel  and 
Toretti, for example, state that: ‘The final conclusion that the entire mass of a body is 
in  effect  a  measure  of  its  energy,  is  of  course  entirely  unwarranted  by  Einstein’s 
premisses’;4 and they quote Einstein as follows: ‘A mass m is equivalent – insofar as 
its  inertia  is  concerned  –  to  an  energy  content  of  magnitude  mc2.  Since  we  can 
arbitrarily  fix  the  zero  of  (the  total  energy),  we  are  not  even  able  to  distinguish, 
without  arbitrariness,  between  a  ‘true’  and  an  ‘apparent’  mass  of  the  system.  It 
appears much more natural to regard all material mass as a store of energy.’5 

Of  course,  what  is  arbitrary  in  special  relativity  need  not  be  arbitrary  in  other 
contexts;  if  an  idea  is  ‘physically  reasonable’  or  ‘natural’,  it  must  be  explicable  in 
terms of some definite physical principles; and if mass is to be considered as a ‘store’ 
of  energy,  then  this  principle  must  be  related  to  the  idea  of  mass  as  a  specifically 
potential form of energy. No problem, therefore, arises if we recognise that mc2 has a 
classical,  as  well  as  relativistic,  meaning.  Its  structure  is  clearly  that  of  a  classical 
potential  energy,  which is precisely what we would expect total energy to be, and it 
was  introduced  to  preserve  a  classical  conservation  law.  Like  many  other  things  in 
relativity  (the  Schwarzschild  radius,  the  equations  for  the  expanding  universe,  the 
gravitational redshift, the spin of the electron), the expression does not arise from the 
theory  of  relativity  itself  but  is  a  more  fundamental  truth  which  that  theory  has 
uncovered. 
 
5 The classical potential energy of the photon 
 
The  number  2  has  frequently  been  described  as  a  ‘relativistic’  factor  separating 
relativistic and nonrelativistic cases, but it is no such thing. It would be extraordinary 
if  relativistic  conditions  should  somehow  conspire  exactly  to  halve  or  double 
significant classical quantities. Relativistic factors are typically of the form  (cid:0) = (1 – v2 
/ c2)–1/2, suggesting some gradual change when v ﬁ
 c. It makes no physical sense to 
suppose  that  the  transition  involves  discrete  integers.  Certainly,  D E  =  D mc2  is  a 
relativistic equation because it incorporates the (cid:0) factor in the D m term, but E = mc2 is 
not, even though it took relativity to discover its application to material particles. mc2 
is  a  potential  energy  term  in  classical  physics  which  has  the  same  effect  as  the 
equation E = mc2 in relativistic physics, and the effects which depend only on E = mc2 
and not specifically on the 4-vector combination of space and time can be derived by

classical  approaches  entirely  independent  of  any  concept  of  relativity.  In  fact,  in the 
special  case  of  light  photons  –  or  light  ‘corpuscles’  in  the  older  terminology  – 
potential energy terms of the form mc2, or their equivalent, have been regularly used 
since the seventeenth century in a variety of classical contexts, and are still so used in 
specialised calculations. 

Newton, for example, in examining atmospheric refraction in 1694, conceived the 
bending of light as equivalent (in our terms) to a change in potential energy from mc2 
as  a  result  of  a  constant  refracting  field  analagous  to  the  gravitational  field  g  at  the 
Earth’s surface.6-8 The equation he used was effectively the same as our steady-state 
potential  energy  (or  ‘vis  viva’)  equation  for  a  circular  gravitational  orbit,  slightly 
modified for the elliptical case. Ordinary refraction he treated as a process analagous 
to  gravitational  orbital  motion,  subject  to  a  force  mc2  /  r,  and,  by  implication,  a 
potential  energy  mc2,  analagous  to  the  gravitational  orbital  force  mv2  /  r  and 
gravitational potential energy mv2. This analogy is possible because the constancy of 
the  velocity  of  light  ensures  that  the  optical  system  is  ‘steady-state’  and  that  its 
potential  energy  term  is  numerically  equivalent  to  that  in  the  inverse-square-law 
gravitational system. 

As  a  result  of  this  second  calculation,  Newton  was  able  to  write  in  a  draft  of 
Query 22/30 for the Opticks that: ‘...upon a fair computation it will (be) found that the 
gravity of our earth towards the Sun in proportion to the quantity of its matter is above 
ten hundred million of millions of millions of millions of times less then the force by 
wch  a  ray  of  light  in  entering  into  glass  or  crystal is drawn or impelled towards the 
refracting body. ...For the velocity of light is to the velocity of Earth in Orbis magnus 
as 58 days of time (in which) the Earth describes the (same space –); that is an arch 
equal to the radius of its orb to about 7 minutes, the time in wch light comes from (the 
Sun) to us; that is as about 12,000 to 1. And the radius of the curvity of a ray of light 
during it(s) refraction  at the surface of glass on wch it falls very obliquely, is to the 
curvity of the earth Orb, as the radius of that Orb to the radius of curvature of the ray 
or as above 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 to 1. And the force wch bends the ray is to the 
force  wch  keeps  the  earth or any Projectile in its orb or line of  Projection in a ratio 
compounded of the duplicate ratio of the velocities & the ratio of the curvities of the 
lines of projection.’9-10 

In  another  calculation  in  the  same  manuscript,  Newton  took  the  radius  of  the 
Earth’s  orbit  as  69  million  miles  (based  on  a  solar  parallax  of  12  seconds)  and  the 
radius  of  curvature  of  the  path  of  a  light  particle  as  10–6  inches.  Assuming  that  the 
light from the Sun takes 7.5 minutes to reach the Earth and that in this time the Earth 
would have travelled 6197 miles, he found the ratio of the forces to be about 5 ·
 1026. 
The  centripetal  force  calculation  used  in  Newton’s  studies  of  refraction  is  an 
illustration  of  the  power  of  the  virial  theorem,  and  must  give  the  correct  numerical 
energy relation whether or not the description of the force is ‘correct’. The constraints 
which need to be applied to find the true nature of the vector force are not required to 

 

8

 

 

 

find the numerical value of the scalar energy. 

A quite different use is found in Newton’s formula for the velocity of waves in a 
medium,  in  terms  of  elasticity  or  pressure  (E)  and  density  ((cid:0) ),  which  he  applied  to 
both light and sound.11 Essentially, Newton’s formula 

 

                     c = (E / (cid:0) )1/2 

 
 
is an expression of the fact that the potential energy of the system of photons, or gas 
molecules in the case of sound (mc2), is equal to the work done at constant pressure as 
a product of pressure and volume. The application to light, or at least to its medium of 
propagation, occurs in the calculation in the published Query 21 of the ratio between 
the  elasticities  per  unit  density  of  a  proposed  electro-optic  ‘aether’  and  atmospheric 
air, and the manuscript evidence shows that this was linked also with the calculation 
of  the  force  of  refraction,  occurring  immediately  after  the  final  version  of  that 
calculation in the manuscript.10 

  1011,  which  is  comparable  with  Newton’s  4.9  ·

Newton’s  elasticity  of  the  aether  is  what  we  would  call  energy  density  of 
radiation  ((cid:0) c2),  which  is  related  by  Maxwell’s  classical  formula  of  1873  to  the 
radiation pressure, and the ratio he calculates is, in effect, the ratio of the energy per 
unit  mass  of  a  particle  of  light  to  the  energy  per  unit  mass  of  an  air  molecule,  as 
manifested in the transmission of sound. Now, the molecular potential energy per unit 
mass for air may be calculated from the kinetic theory of gases (PV = RT) at about 1.8 
 105 J kg–1 when T = 300 K. Since the energy per unit mass for a light photon is 9 ·
 
1016  J  kg–1,  the  ratio  is  5  ·

minimum in Query 21. Light, of course, will always give ‘correct’ results for such a 
calculation when travelling through a vacuum, because in such circumstances, there is 
no  source  of  dissipation,  and  the  virial  relation  takes  on  its  ideal  form.  Newton’s 
formula  for  calculating  the  velocities  of  waves  in  a  medium  is  thus  another  perfect 
illustration of an application of the virial theorem, and it is because it is such a perfect 
illustration  that  it  works  in  a  case  where  the  model  of  interaction  with  matter  no 
longer  applies.  This  is  why  the  elasticity  of  light  is  precisely  the  same  thing  as  its 
energy density.  Although this does not apply as exactly to sound, where (as Laplace 
later showed) the ‘elasticity’ constant needs to be calculated from the adiabatic, rather 
than  the  isothermal,  value,  the  correction  factor  is  relatively  small  in  order  of 
magnitude terms (20 %). 
 
6 The gravitational bending of light 
 
Interestingly, though light in free space has velocity c, and, therefore, no rest mass or 
kinetic energy, as soon as you apply a gravitational field, the light ‘slows down’, and, 
at  least  behaves  as  though  it  can  be  treated  as  a  particle  with  kinetic  energy  in  the 
field.  This  is  precisely  what  happens  when  we  use  the  standard  Newtonian  escape

A classic case of applying a kinetic energy-type equation to light, is the classical 
derivation  of  the  double  gravitational  bending,  an  effect  normally  thought  to  be 
derivable  only  from  the  general  relativistic  field  equations.  The  double  bending  of 
light  in  a  gravitational  field  has  been  a  cause  celêbre  since  Eddington  used  it  to 
establish  Einstein’s  theory  in  the  eclipse  expedition  of  1919.14  We  have  since  that 
time been repeatedly assured that the double bending is a relativistic effect, and that 
‘Newtonian’  calculations,  using  the  principle  of  equivalence,  yield  only  half  the 
correct value, although several authors have put forward demonstrations of the double 
deflection based only on special relativity. 15-18 

The ‘Newtonian’ calculation takes its origin from Soldner, who, we are told, in a 
paper of 1801,19-21 investigated the gravitational deflection of light by a massive body, 
using  the  standard  ‘vis  viva’  theorem  or  potential  energy  equation  (modified  for  a 
hyperbolic orbit), according to the expression:

with  e  taken  as  the  eccentricity  of  the  hyperbolic  orbit.  Since  1  «  e,  the  half-angle 
deflection becomes 
 
 
and the full angle deflection (that is, in and out of the gravitational field) 
 
 
 
General relativity, however, finds 
 
 
 
and  it  was  the  supposed  experimental  realisation  of  this  result  which  allowed 
Eddington to claim that he had ‘overthrown’ Newtonian physics.

on the basis of Laplace’s prior employment of it in calculating the black hole radius, 
and  he  would  have  obtained  the  ‘correct’  total  deflection  if  he  had  used  the  double 
angle  in  calculating  his  integral!  This  was,  indeed,  correct  procedure,  for  the 
deflection of a photon coming past the Sun’s edge from infinity is a case of an orbit in 
the  process  of  formation,  and  not  an  orbit  in  steady  state.  It  is  the  reverse  of  the 
process of creating an orbit by escaping from the confining field, modified, of course, 
by  the  hyperbolic,  rather  than  circular  or  elliptical,  orbit  produced  by  the  immense 
relative  speed  of  the  light  photon.  The  significant  consideration  is  that,  on  its 
immensely long journey prior to its coming close to the gravitational field of the Sun, 
the  photon’s  velocity  was  not  determined  by  the  Sun’s  gravitational  field,  and  the 
direction  of  its  deflection  is  perpendicular  to  this.  The  classical  equation  used  by 
Eddington was the one specified for steady-state conditions, whereas light-bending is 
surely an example of energy exchange. 

We should not be surprised that a purely classical calculation of the light-bending 
is  possible  in  this  way.  In  principle,  relativity  theory  does  not  produce  different 
energy  equations  to  classical  physics;  it  merely  corrects  our  naïve  understanding  of 
what  are  steady-state  and  what  are  changing  conditions.  The  photon,  in  particular, 
provides an instance in which we would expect relativistic equations to coincide with 
classical ones. Photon energy, after all, is field energy and has no material component; 
the  photon  mass  is,  therefore,  defined  in  terms  of  a  pre-existing  classical  energy 
equation and does not provide a source of independent information which can be used 
to distinguish between classical and relativistic conditions. 

The use of a ‘kinetic energy’ expression mc2 / 2 in the case of light bending does 
not,  of  course,  imply  that  photon  ‘total  energy’  is  of  this  form,  or  that  there  is  any 
such thing as the ‘kinetic energy’ of a photon; mc2 / 2 (as in the parallel case of the 
derivation  of  the  Schwarzschild  radius)  is  merely  an  expression  of  the  action  of  the 
perturbing  field.  We  never  see  this energy directly, for, whenever a photon interacts 
with  matter  (or  is  ‘detected’),  its  ‘independent’  existence  has  ceased  and  the  energy 
absorbed  is  purely  the  potential  or  total  energy  value  mc2.  It  is  this  aspect  of  the 
photon’s existence that has led to the idea that the absence of the factor 2 is somehow 
a mysterious property of relativity not paralleled in classical physics. 

The  idea  that  a  ‘relativistic’  correction  (either  special  or  general)  ‘causes’  the 
doubling  of  gravitational  effect  is  an  illustration,  not  of  the  fact  that  the  calculation 
has  to  be  done  in  a  relativistic  way,  but  that  relativity  provides  one  way  of 
incorporating the effect of changing conditions if we begin with the potential, rather 
than  the  kinetic,  energy  equation.  Here,  the  potential  energy  equation  typically 
produces the effect of gravitational redshift, or time dilation, while relativity adds the 
corresponding length contraction. So some authors have argued for the redshift being 

 

11

 

 

‘Newtonian’  while  the  length-contraction  or  ‘space-warping’  is  relativistic,  while 
others  claim  that  the  reverse  is  true.  It  has  also  been  claimed  variously  that  the 
‘Newtonian’  effect  has  to  be  added  to  that  produced  by  the  Einstein  calculation  of 
1911, based on the equivalence principle (which also obtained only half of the correct 
value), or that the two effects are the same, and have to be supplemented by a ‘true’ 
relativistic effect, like the Thomas precession.16,22-25 It is, of course, purely (classical) 
energy considerations which decide the issue. If the potential energy equation is used 
where  the  kinetic energy equation is appropriate, then (correct) physical reasons can 
be found for almost any additional term which doubles the effect predicted. 

The  true  nature  of  the  contributions  made  by  different  causes  to  the  three 
relativistic  predictions  of  redshift,  light  bending  and  perihelion  precession  has  been 
obscured  by  the  all-embracing  nature  of  the  general  relativistic  formalism,  and  it  is 
too easily assumed that the effects can be derived only from the full field equations of 
general relativity. Comparison with classical predictions demonstrate that redshift and 
the time dilation components of light bending and perihelion precession depend only 
on the relation E = mc2 and not on the 4-vector combination of space and time. The 
spatial components of the light bending and perihelion precession should then follow 
automatically  from  the application of 4-vector space-time without  any need to apply 
the equivalence principle, any time dilation necessarily requiring an equivalent length 
contraction.  However,  since  mc2  in  a  field  has  a  ‘kinetic  energy’  equivalent,  even 
special  relativity  is  only  an  alternative  approach  to  a  calculation  that  must  also  be 
valid classically.14,26-27 

In a historical context, although we have no direct calculation of the ‘Newtonian’ 
deflection of light from Newton himself, there is a related calculation of atmospheric 
refraction using the potential energy equation, similar to the one already mentioned.6-8 
Newton assumes a constant refracting field f at a height h above the Earth’s surface, 
entirely  analagous  to  the  gravitational  field  g  (=  GM  /  r2). He then uses Proposition 
XLI, to calculate the resulting deflection into parabolic orbits of light rays entering the 
Earth’s atmosphere. The assumption of parabolic orbits requires mc2 to be equated to 
the  potential  energy  term  mfr  (1 + cos  (cid:0)), equivalent to the gravitational GMm (1 + 
cos (cid:0)) / r, while the use of Proposition XLI is equivalent to a modification of c2 by the 
factor (1 – 2fh / c2) in the same way as the principle of equivalence is used to modify 
c2  by  (1  –  2gr  /  c2)  or  (cid:1)
–2  in  gravitational  bending.  Significantly,  atmospheric 
refraction  is  still  calculated  in  modern  astronomical  textbooks  using  the  old 
corpuscular theory! 

 

7 The gyromagnetic ratio of the electron    
 
Relativity  has  also  been  assumed  to  be  needed  to  explain  the  anomalous  magnetic 
moment or, equivalently, the gyromagnetic ratio of a Bohr electron acquiring energy a 
magnetic  field. According to  ‘classical’ reasoning, it has been supposed, an electron

2), to an angular frequency change 

changing its angular frequency from (cid:0)0 to (cid:0) acquires energy in a magnetic field B of 
the form 
  
 
leading, after factorization of ((cid:0)
 
  
 
However, a relativistic effect (the Thomas precession, again) ensures that the classical 
e(cid:0)0rB is replaced by 2e(cid:0)0rB, leading to

But relativistic and classical treatments coincide when, as with the light bending 
example,  the  kinetic  energy  equation  is  recognised  as  the  one  applied  to  changing 
conditions, at the instant we ‘switch on’ the field. Then, we automatically write 
 
   
 
which is no more, in principle, than the equation of motion for uniform acceleration

                  v2 – u2 = 2as  . 

  
 

So,  the  Thomas  precession is needed if we begin with the potential energy equation 
applicable to a steady state, but not if we apply the kinetic energy used for changing 
conditions. 
 
8 The Dirac equation 
 
The gyromagnetic ratio leads on naturally to the subject of electron spin. For this, we 
need to introduce the Dirac equation. Here it will be convenient to rewrite the Dirac 
equation, 
                                                 ((cid:1)
or 
 
 
in a more algebraic form with the g matrices replaced by a combination of quaternion 
and multivariate 4-vector algebras.28-36 Here, we write 
 
  
 

(cid:1)1 = ii ;     
           (cid:1)0 = ik    ;

The  reformulation  is  necessary  to  the  understanding  of  how  the  Dirac  equation 
relates  to  classical  energy  conservation  rules,  for,  using  it,  we  can  easily  derive  the 
Dirac  equation,  via  the  Correspondence  Principle.  We  take  the  classical  relativistic 
energy-momentum conservation equation:

wavefunction  a  product  of  two  nilpotents  (each  not  nilpotent  to  the  other).  The 
multiplications here are scalar multiplications of a 4-component bra vector (composed 
of the left-hand brackets), representing the particle states, and a ket vector (composed 
of the right-hand brackets), representing the antiparticle states. 
 
9 Electron spin from the Dirac equation 
 
The  conventional  treatment  of  spin  introduces  the  factor  2  through  the  property  of 
noncommutation of vector operators. From the standard version of the Dirac equation, 
we obtain 
                                        [s
 
where H  is the Hamiltonian, or total energy operator, and 
 
 
and 
                                    i(cid:0)0g
 
Translating this into our new Dirac formalism, we obtain: 
 
 
or 
                                                            s
and 
 
 
where 1 is the unit (spin) vector.

The  factor  2  appears  as  a  result  of  noncommutation.  Specifically,  it  is  the 
anticommuting property of the multivariate vectors in the  (cid:0) matrices which produces 
the doubling effect. This is the result we wished to achieve. The rest of the derivation 
is purely formal, and can be done either conventionally or in the new formalism. If L 
is the orbital angular momentum r ·
 
                                             [L, H ] = [r ·
                                                        = [r ·
 
Taking out common factors, 
 
                                             [L, H ] = i(cid:0)0 [r, g

                                                        = –j [r, 1.p] ·
Now, 
 
          [r, 1.p] (cid:1) = – ii 
 
                                                        = i1 (cid:1) . 
Hence, 
                                                  [L, H ] = – ij 1 ·

p term, and has nothing to do with whether the equation used is relativistic or not. It is 
significant here  that the standard derivation of the Schrödinger equation begins with

We can see from this derivation that the factor 2 is both introduced with the transition 
in  the  Schrödinger  equation  from  the  classical  kinetic energy term, and, at the same 
time, produced by the anticommuting nature of the momentum operator. 
 
12 The Heisenberg uncertainty principle 
 
It  is  precisely  because the Schrödinger equation is derived via a kinetic energy term 
that this factor enters into the expression for the spin, and this process is essentially 
the  same  as  the  process  which,  through  the  anticommuting  quantities  of  the  Dirac 
s^ / 2) a constant of the motion. Anticommuting operators also 
equation, makes (L +  s
introduce the factor 2 in the Heisenberg uncertainty relation for the same reason, and 
the Heisenberg term relates directly to the zero-point energy derived from the kinetic 
energy  of  the  harmonic  oscillator.  The  formal  derivation  of  the  Heisenberg 
uncertainty  relation  assumes  a  state  represented  by  a  state  vector  y   which  is  an 
eigenvector  of  the  operator  P.  In  this  case,  the  expectation  value  of  the  variable  p2 
becomes 
 
 
and the mean squared variance 
 
                                           (D p)2 = (cid:0)*{P – <p>I}2
 
if P' = P – <p>I and I is a unit matrix. Similarly, for operator Q, 
 
                                           (D q)2 = (cid:0)*{Q – <q>I}2
 
Since P'(cid:0) and Q'(cid:0) are vectors, 
 
                       (D p)2 (D q)2 = ((cid:0)*P’2

13 The harmonic oscillator 
 
The factor 2 in the quantum harmonic oscillator is clearly derived from the fact that 
2x2 / 2, is taken from a 
the varying potential energy term added to the Hamiltonian, m(cid:0)
classical term of the mv2 / 2 type. So, the Schrödinger equation for the eigenfunction 
un(x)  and  eigenvalue  En,  with  the  h¯ 2  explicitly  included  and  the  spatial  dimensions 
reduced to the linear x, becomes: 
 
                                     
 
This equation, as solved in standard texts on quantum mechanics, produces a ground 
state  energy  h¯ (cid:0)  /  2,  with  the  factor  2 originating in the 2m in the original equation. 
We define the new variables

Here, we can derive the factor 2 in E0 directly from the introduction into Schrödinger 
equation of the classical term m(cid:1)
 
14 The Klein-Gordon equation 
 
From both  Dirac and Schrödinger equations, we see that fermions have half-integral 
spins. How, then, do we explain the integral spins of bosons, such as the photon? The 
answer  here  is  that,  while  the  fermion  equation  is  the  kinetic  energy  equation  of 
Schrödinger or Dirac, based on mv2 / 2 or p2 / 2m, the boson equation is the potential 
energy equation, based on E = mc2, where m is now the ‘relativistic’, rather than the 
rest mass. Once again, the origin of the factor 2 is seen in the virial relation between 
kinetic and potential energies. The Klein-Gordon equation, which applies in quantum 
mechanics to the photon, derives its integral spin values from the fact that its energy 
term  contains  unit  values  of  the  mass  m.  To  derive  this  equation,  we  quantize  the 
classical relativistic energy-momentum equation, 
 

2x2 / 2, which is equivalent to mv2 / 2.

15 Relativistic mass and rest mass 
 
In  principle,  the  kinetic  energy  relation  is  used  when  we  consider  a  particle  as  an 
object  in  itself,  described  by  a  rest  mass  m0,  undergoing  a  continuous  change.  The 
potential energy relation is used when we consider a particle within its ‘environment’, 
with ‘relativistic mass’, in an equilibrium state requiring a discrete transition for any 
change.  The  existence  of  these  two  conservation  of  energy  approaches  has  very 
profound implications, and arises from a very deep stratum in physics. Kinetic energy 
may be associated with rest mass, because it cannot be defined without it – one could 
consider  light  ‘slowing  down’  in  a  gravitational  field  as  effectively  equivalent  to 
adopting  a  rest  mass,  and,  of  course,  photons  do  acquire  ‘effective  masses’  in 
condensed  matter.  Potential  energy  is  associated  with  ‘relativistic’  mass because the 
latter  is  defined  through  a  potential  energy-type  term  (E  =  mc2),  light  in  free  space 
being the extreme case, with no kinetic energy / rest mass, and 100 per cent potential 
energy / relativistic mass. The description, in addition, seems to fit in with the halving 
that goes on, for a material particle, when we expand its relativistic mass-energy term 
(mc2)  to  find  its  kinetic  energy  (mv2  /  2).  One  way  of  looking  at  it  is  to  take  the 
relativistic energy conservation equation 
 

            E2 – p2c2 – m0

2c4 = 0  .

We can take regard this as a ‘relativistic’ mass (potential energy) equation of the 
form  E  =  mc2  (treating  at  one  go  the  particle  interacting  with  its  environment),  and 
proceed to quantize to a Klein-Gordon equation, with integral spin. Alternatively, we 
can separate out the kinetic energy term using the rest mass m0. From 
 

 
we take the square root, and obtain 
 

  E2 = m0


2c4 


  E = m0c2 + 

m0v2
2  + … . 

The Schrödinger equation, of course, arises from this approach, quantizing mv2 / 
2  in  the  form  p2  /  2m.  Now,  as  we  have  shown,  using  a  multivariate  form  of  the 
momentum operator, p = –i(cid:209)
 + eA, the Schrödinger equation produces the magnetic 
moment  of  the  electron,  with  the  required half-integral value of spin,  the ½ coming 
from the term mv2/2 or p2/2m; and it is also effectively a limiting approximation to the 
bispinor form of the Dirac equation. In principle, as we have seen, this means that the 
spin ½ term that arises from the Dirac equation has nothing to do with the fact that the 
equation  is  relativistic,  but  arises  from  the  fundamentally  multivariate  nature  of  its 
use  of  the  momentum  operator.  We  can  now  see  that  it  comes  from  the  very act of 
square rooting the energy equation in the same way as that operation produces mv2 / 2 
in  the  relativistic  expansion.  The  ½  is,  in  essence,  a  statement  of  the  act  of  square-
rooting, which is exactly what happens when we split 0 into two nilpotents; the ½ in 
the Schrödinger approximation is a manifestation of this which we can trace through 
the ½ in the relativistic binomial approximation. 

Significantly, the origin of the factor 2 is seen here in the process which square 
roots the expression E2 – m2. The origin of the same factor in the derivation of spin 
from the Dirac equation, is seen in the behaviour of the anticommuting terms which 
result from this process. In fact, the two factors have precisely the same origin. 

Another  aspect  of  the  process  is  that  dimensionality,  in  general,  introduces  two 
orders of meaning in a parameter – of the value (as in length / time or charge / mass), 
and of the squared value (as in Pythagorean / vector addition of space dimensions, or 
space  and  time,  or  energy  and  momentum,  or  charges  /  masses  ‘interacting’  to 
produce forces). In a sense we are doing this with fermion and boson wavefunctions, 
one type being a ‘square root’ of the other. 
 
16 Zero point energy 
 
The  importance  of  the  factor  2  in  all  our  examples  lies  in  the  fact  that  it  relates 
together  two parallel but almost independent streams of physics: the continuous and 
the  discontinuous.  Expressions  involving  half  units  of  h¯   do  not  suggest  that  there is

such a thing as half a photon, but represent, rather, an average or integrated increase 
from 0 to h¯ . The half-values are characteristic of the continuous option in physics, the 
integral  ones  of  the  discontinuous  option.  Schrödinger,  for  example,  represents  the 
former, with gradualistic energy exchange and a kinetic energy equation, Heisenberg 
the  latter,  with  abrupt  transitions  between states in integer values of  h¯ w , determined 
by bosonic (potential energy) equations. Both approaches are equally valid, although 
they  represent  divergent  physical  models,  and  it  is  not  surprising  that  a  completely 
continuous theory of stochastic electrodynamics, based on the existence of zero-point 
energy of value h¯ (cid:0) / 2, at each point in space, has developed as a rival to the purely 
discrete theory of the quantum with energy h¯ (cid:0). 

Stochastic  electrodynamics  has  been  successful 

in  providing  classical 
explanations of the Planck black body radiation law from equipartition, and of Bose-
Einstein  statistics  for  photons.38-42  In  addition,  spontaneous  emission,  Bohr 
law  of 
transitions,  zitterbewegung,  Van  der  Waals  forces,  and 
from 
thermodynamics,  have  been  shown  as  classical  phenomena  arising 
 /  2  per  normal 
electromagnetic  radiation,  with  the  stochastic  energy  spectrum  of  h¯ (cid:0)
mode of vibration,38,43 and the same principle has been used to derive the Schrödinger 
equation from Newtonian mechanics.44,45 Stochastic electrodynamics appears to form 
a successful continuous option to discrete quantum mechanics based on the use of a 
half value of the energy quantum.

the 

In  fact,  not  only  are  both  discrete  and  continuous  options  possible  –  both  are 
required  within  a  system.  Discrete  systems  have  to  incorporate  continuity,  and 
continuous ones discreteness. Schrödinger thus has a continuous system based on h¯  / 
2, but incorporates discreteness (based on h¯ ) in the process of measurement – the so-
called  collapse  of  the  wavefunction.  Heisenberg,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a  discrete 
system,  based  on  h¯ ,  but  incorporates  continuity  (and  h¯   /  2)  in  the  process  of 
measurement  –  via  the  uncertainty  principle  and  zero-point  energy.  Continuity  and 
discontinuity must both be present in a successful system, so whichever is not present 
in  the  mathematical  structure  must  be  introduced  in  the  process  of  measurement.  In 
 / 2 in 
addition, it would seem, nature always manages to provide a route by which h¯ (cid:0)
one  context  becomes  h¯ (cid:0)  in  another.  This  occurs,  for  example,  in  the  case  of  black-
body radiation, where the spontaneous emission of energy of value h¯ (cid:0) is produced by 
 /  2  units  of  energy  provided  by  both  oscillators  and 
the  combined  effect  of  the  h¯ (cid:0)
zero-point field.46 

Just  as  the  relativistic  expression  for  kinetic  energy  presents  a  problem  in  the 
asymptotic  approach  to  classical  conditions,  so  does  Planck’s  quantum  law of black 
body  radiation.  As  Einstein  and  Stern  noticed  in  1913,  the  Planck  equation  for  the 
energy of each oscillator 
 
 
does  not  reduce  to  the  classical  limit  kT  when  kT  »  h(cid:1),  but  to  kT  –  h(cid:1)/  2.  Planck

himself, in his so-called ‘second theory of radiation’, based on discrete emission but 
classical or continuous absorption, had obtained the modified law 
 
  
 
which  suggested,  as  he  said,  that,  even  at  the  absolute  zero  of  temperature,  each 
oscillator had an energy equivalent to h(cid:0)

In quantum mechanics, as we have seen, the zero-point energy term, h(cid:0)

 / 2 or h¯ (cid:1) 
/  2,  is  derived  from  the  harmonic  oscillator  solution of the Schrödinger equation. In 
the  Heisenberg  formulation  it  appears  as  a  result  of  the  h¯   /  2  term  involved  in  the 
uncertainty principle. The derivation via Schrödinger shows the kinetic origins of the 
factor  2.  The  derivation  from  the  uncertainty  principle  suggests  the  origin  of  this 
fundamental  constant  in  continuum  physics,  as  opposed  to  the  constant  h  used  in 
discrete  theories.  It  certainly  does  not  suggest  that  there  is  any  such  thing as a half-
photon! 
 
17 Radiation reaction 
 
The  h¯ (cid:1)  /  2  ﬁ
  h¯ (cid:1)  transition  for  black  body  radiation  can  also  be  seen  in  terms  of 
radiation  reaction.  Perhaps,  surprisingly,  this  has  an  intimate  connection  with  the 
distinction between the relativistic and rest masses of an object. The act of defining a 
rest  mass  also  defines  an  isolated  object,  and  one  cannot  define  kinetic  energy  in 
terms of anything but this rest mass. If, however, we take a relativistic mass, we are 
already  incorporating  the  effects  of  the  environment.  The  most  obvious  instance  is 
that  of  the  photon.  The  photon  has  no  rest  mass,  only  a  relativistic  mass;  mc2  for  a 
photon  behaves  exactly  like  a  classical  potential  energy  term,  as  well  as  having  the 
exact  form  of  a  potential  energy  for  a  body  of  mass  m  and  speed  c.  A  particular 
instance we have used is the application of a material gas analogy to a photon gas in 
producing  radiation  pressure  (cid:2) c2  /  3.  Action  and  reaction  occurs  in  this  instance 
because the doubling of the value of the energy term comes from the doubling of the 
momentum produced by the rebound of the molecules / photons from the walls of the 
container – a classic two-step process, like the two-way speed of light. 

The  energy  involved  in  both  material  and  photon  gas  pressure  derivations  is 
clearly a potential energy term (the material gas energy having to be halved to relate 
the kinetic energy of the molecules to temperature), and its double nature is derived 
from the two-way process which it involves, which is the same thing as saying that it 
is  Newton’s  action  and  reaction.  The  same  thing  happens  with  radiation  reaction, 
which  produces  a  ‘mysterious’  doubling  of  energy  h(cid:0)  /  2  to  h(cid:0)  in  many  cases  (and 
also zitterbewegung for the electron, which is interpreted as a switching between two 
states).  In  another  context,  Feynman  and  Wheeler  also  produce  a  doubling  of  the 
contribution  of  the  retarded  wave  in  electromagnetic  theory,  at  the  expense  of  the 

 

26

 

 

advanced  wave,  by  assuming  that  the  vacuum  behaves  as  a  perfect  absorber  and 
reradiator of  radiation. In principle, this seems to be equivalent to assuming a filled 
vacuum for advanced waves (equivalent to Dirac’s filled vacuum for antimatter), and 
relates  to  previously  stated  ideas  that  continuity  of  mass-energy  in  the  vacuum  is 
related  to  the  unidirectionality  of  time.47-50  There  are  also  connections  with  some 
paradoxes in special relativity. 
 
18 Paradoxes in special relativity 
 
As  we  have  seen,  we  frequently  find  the  factor  2  where  we  need  to  introduce  such 
ideas as radiation reaction in the theory of zero point energy. Incorporating radiation 
reaction  means  that  we  are  also  incorporating  the  effect  of  Newton’s  third  law,  the 
process  which  produces  the  required  doubling  in  the  case  of  material  and  photon 
gases, and other steady-state processes. However, many of the same results, as in the 
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, are also explained by special relativity. 
It has been argued by C. K. Whitney that the correct result for the electron is obtained 
by  treating  the  transmission  of  light  as  a  two-step  process  involving  absorption  and 
emission.51 This is interesting because it is equivalent to incorporating both action and 
reaction,  or  the potential energy equation, and the same result follows classically by 
defining the potential energy at the moment the field is switched on. However, if we 
use  kinetic  energy,  or  a  one-step  process,  we  also  need  relativity,  because,  once  we 
introduce rest mass, we can no longer use classical equations. (‘Relativistic mass’ is, 
of  course,  specifically  designed to preserve classical energy conservation!) The two-
step  process  is analagous to the use of radiation reaction, so it follows, in principle, 
that a radiation reaction is equivalent to adding a relativistic ‘correction’ (such as the 
Thomas precession). 

Whitney’s argument that the two-step processs removes those special relativistic 
paradoxes  which  involve  apparent  reciprocity,  is  also  interesting,  because  special 
relativity,  by  including  only  one  side  of  the  calculation,  effectively  removes 
reciprocity, and so leads to such things as asymmetric ageing in the twin paradox. The 
argument, put forward by some authors,52 that the problems arise in Einstein’s denial 
of the aether may also be relevant if we translate it to the vacuum, because no vacuum 
means no ‘environment’, and, therefore, no ‘reaction’. Similar arguments again apply 
to the idea that the problem lies in attempting to define a one-way speed of light that 
cannot be measured, because a two-way speed measurement of the speed of light also 
requires a two-step process. 

Whitney  further  shows  that  the  classic  light-bending  and  perihelion  precession 
‘tests’ of General Relativity can be derived using a two-step process. This, again, is of 
interest, because, as shown here, it is certainly possible to derive the light bending by 
classical  arguments  using  kinetic  energy  (which  is  the  same  thing  as  using  special 
relativity, because light has no rest mass), and it is also possible to derive perihelion

precession using special relativity, as a number of authors have demonstrated.14,16,18 
 
19 The Jahn-Teller effect 
 
From  the  earlier  sections,  it  would  appear  that  all  the  important  factors  of  2  in 
classical physics, relativity and quantum physics, result from a choice between using 
kinetic or potential energies, and that this is equivalent to using either the action side, 
or the combined action and reaction sides, of Newton’s third law of motion. This, in 
turn,  derives  from  a  choice  between  using  continuous  or  discrete  solutions,  or 
changing  or  fixed  ones.  A  series  of  further  arguments  show  that  the  origin  of  the 
factor  lies  in  the  symmetry  between  the  action  of  an  object  and  the  reaction  of  its 
environment – which may be either material or vacuum.33 A fermionic object on its 
own shows changing  behaviour, requiring an integration which generates a factor ½ 
in  the  kinetic  energy  term,  and  a  sign  change  when  it  rotates  through  2p ;  but  a 
conservative  ‘system’  of  object  plus  environment  shows  unchanging  behaviour, 
requiring a potential energy term, which is twice the kinetic energy. 

This  kind  of  argument  makes  sense  of  the  boson  /  fermion  distinction  and  the 
spin 1 / ½ division between the particle types in a fundamental way, as well as leading 
to supersymmetry, vacuum polarization, pair production, renormalization, and so on, 
because the halving of energy in ‘isolating’ the fermion from its vacuum or material 
‘environment’  is  the  same  process  as  mathematically  square-rooting  the  quantum 
operator  via  the  Dirac  equation.  Bell  et  al  have  shown  that  integral  spins  are 
automatically  produced  from  half-integral  spin  electrons using the Berry phase, and, 
by  generalizing  this  kind  of  result  to  all  possible  environments,  we  may  extend  the 
principle  in  the  direction  of  supersymmetry.53  In  principle,  we  propose  that  energy 
principles  determine  that  all  fermions,  in  whatever  circumstances,  may  be  regarded 
either  as  isolated  spin  ½  objects  or  as  spin  1  objects  in  conjunction  with  some 
particular material or vacuum environment, or, indeed, the ‘rest of the universe’. 

While  hypothetically  isolated  fermions  may  follow  the  Dirac  equation,  derived 
from  the  kinetic  energy  relation,  and  similarly  isolated  bosons  follow  the  Klein-
Gordon equation, derived from the potential energy relation, the same particles in real 
situations  behave  very  differently.  Fermions  with  spin  ½  become  spin  1  particles 
when taken  in conjunction  with their environment, whatever that may be. The Jahn-
Teller  effect  and  Aharanov-Bohm  effect  are  examples.  Treated  semi-classically,  the 
Jahn-Teller  effect,  for  electrons  in  condensed  matter,  couples  the  factors  associated 
with  the  motions  of  the  relevant  electronic  and  nuclear  coordinates  so  that  different 
parts  of  the  total  wavefunction  change  sign  in  a  coordinated  manner  to preserve the 
single-valuedness of the total wavefunction. This is possible because the time-scale of 
the nuclear motions is much greater than that for the electronic transitions. Neither the 
nuclear nor the electronic wavefunction are single-valued by themselves, but the total 
wavefunction becomes so through the Jahn-Teller effect. 

 

28

 

 

In  more  general  terms,  the  relationship  between  a  fermion  and  ‘the  rest  of  the 
universe’  can  be  considered  as  similar  to  the  that  of  the  total  wavefunction  in  the 
Jahn-Teller effect. Isolated fermions cannot have single-valued wavefunctions, but the 
total  wavefunction  representing  fermion  plus  ‘rest  of  the  universe’  must  be  single-
valued. This duality occurs with the actual creation of the fermion state. To split away 
a  fermion  from  a  ‘system’  (or  ‘the  universe’),  we  have  to  introduce  a  coupling  as  a 
mathematical  description  of  the  splitting.  The  coupling  to  the  rest  of  the  universe 
preserves 
total  wavefunction,  automatically 
introducing the extra term known as the Berry phase. Many physical effects, including 
the  Aharanov-Bohm  effect,  as  well  as  the  Jahn-Teller  effect,  are  already  associated 
with this phase, and there are, no doubt, many others waiting to be discovered. 

the  single-valued  nature  of 

the 

The  reverse  effect  must  also  exist,  in  which  bosons  of  spin  0  or 1 couple to an 
‘environment’ to produce fermion-like states. Perhaps the Higgs mechanism occurs in 
this  way,  but  a  more  immediate  possibility  is  the  coupling  of  gluons  to  the  quark-
gluon  plasma  to  deliver  the  total  spin  of  ½  or  3/2  to  a  baryon.  The  six-component 
baryon wavefunction has states equivalent to (kE –
 
iipz  +  ijm),  where  the  px,  py,  pz  and  –
  represent  the  six  degrees  of  freedom  for  p.33 
These, of course, exist simultaneously in a gauge-invariant state, but we can imagine 
the  p  rotating  through  the  three  spatial  positions  leaving  terms  like  (kE  –
  iip  +  ijm) 
(kE  +  ijm)  (kE  +  ijm);  (kE  +  ijm)  (kE  –
  iip  +  ijm)  (kE  +  ijm),  with  the  gluons 
‘transferring’ the p between one (kE + ijm) and another, and so becoming bosons of 
spin  1  with  an  effective  contribution  from  the  ‘environment’  due  to  the  gluon  sea 
making them transfer spin ½. 

 iipy + ijm) (kE –

 iipx + ijm) (kE –

It is almost certainly a universal principle that fermions / bosons always produce 
a  ‘reaction’  within  their  environment,  which  couples  them  to  the  appropriate 
wavefunction-changing  term,  so  that  the  potential  /  kinetic  energy  relation  can  be 
maintained at the same time as its opposite. We can relate this to the whole process of 
renormalization  which  produces  an  infinite  chain  of  such  couplings  through  the 
vacuum. The coupling of the vacuum to fermions generates ‘boson-images’ and vice 
versa. This suggests that the loop diagrams that lead to renormalisation could produce 
the required cancellation of fermion with boson loops without requiring the existence 
of extra boson or fermion equivalents.54 
 
20 Renormalization 
 
To  understand  the  principle,  we  need  to  use  the  nilpotent  version  of  the  Dirac 
wavefunction, which is, typically, (kE + iip + ijm) for a fermion and (–kE + iip + ijm) 
for  an  antifermion,  these  being  abbreviated  representions  of  4-term  bra  and  ket 
vectors,  cycling  through  the  full  range  of  – E  and  – p  values.  In  terms  of  the 
‘environment’ principle, a fermion generates an infinite series of interacting terms of 
the form: 

 

29

 

(kE + iip + ijm) 
(kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm) 
(kE + ikp + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm)( kE + iip + ijm) 
(kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm)( kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm), etc. 
 

Selection  of  the  appropriate  terms  in  QED  calculations  now  leads  to  a 
cancellation of the boson and fermion loops of opposite sign at any level. The (kE + 
iip  +  ijm)  and  (–kE  +  iip  +  ijm)  vectors  are  an  expression  of  the  behaviour  of  the 
vacuum state, which acts like a ‘mirror image’ to the fermion. An expression such as 

 
                                   (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) 

 
is part of an infinite regression of images of the form 
 

(kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) ...  

 
where the vacuum state depends on the operator that acts upon it, the vacuum state of 
(kE + iip + ijm), for example, becoming k (kE + iip + ijm). In addition, 
 

(kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) k (kE + iip + ijm) ...  

 
is the same as 
 

(kE + iip + ijm) (–kE + iip + ijm) (kE + iip + ijm) ( –kE + iip + ijm) ... . 

So, the infinite series of creation acts by a fermion on vacuum turns out to be the 
mechanism  for  creating  an  infinite  series  of  alternating  boson  and  fermion  states  as 
required  for  supersymmetry  and  renormalization.  This  is  only  true  if  the  series  is 
infinite, because each ‘antifermion’ bracket has to be postmultiplied by k to alter the 
sign  of  its  E  term.  It  also  requires  spin  terms  p  of  the  same  sign  to  produce  spin  1 
bosons; spin 0, such as the mass-generating Higgs boson, would break the sequence. 

The  ‘mirror  imaging’  process  implies  an  infinite  range  of  virtual  E  values  in 
vacuum adding up to a single finite value, exactly as in renormalisation. Significantly, 
the vacuum wavefunctions for the fermion and antifermion are of the complementary 
forms, (–kE + ii p + ij m) and (kE + ii p + ij m), to those for the particles. It is also 
significant  that,  in  the  classical  context,  the  related  Feynman-Wheeler  process  of 
vacuum  absorption  of  radiation  (discussed  in  section  17)  again  reduces  the  infinite 
electron self-energy to a finite mass.

21 Supersymmetry 
 
‘Supersymmetry’ may  be part of a much more general pattern. Bosons and fermions 
seem to require ‘partner states’ as much as potential and kinetic energy are needed to 
fully  describe  conservation.  As  previously  stated,  the  kinetic  energy  relation  is  used 
when  we  consider  a  particle  as  an  object  in  itself,  described  by  a  rest  mass  m0, 
undergoing  a  continuous  change.  The  potential  energy  relation  is  used  when  we 
consider a particle within its ‘environment’, with ‘relativistic mass’, in an equilibrium 
state requiring a discrete transition for any change. This fundamental relation, leads to 
the  significant  fact  that  the  nilpotent  wavefunctions,  in  principle,  produce  a  kind  of 
supersymmetry,  with  the  supersymmetric  partners  not  being  so  much  realisable 
particles, as the couplings of the fermions and bosons to vacuum states. 

for 

The  nilpotent  operators  defined 

fermion  wavefunctions  are  also 
supersymmetry  operators,  which  produce  the  supersymmetric  partner  in  the  particle 
itself. The Q generator for supersymmetry is simply the term (kE + iip + ijm), and its 
Hermitian conjugate Q† is (–kE + iip + ijm). Written out in full, of course, these are 
respectively four-term bra and ket vectors, with the E and p values going through the 
complete cycle of + and – values; and, with the application of the same normalization 
that we have used for the vacuum operator, the anticommutator of Q and Q† becomes 
effectively  E,  or  the  Hamiltonian,  as  in  conventional  supersymmetry  theory. 
Multiplying  by  (kE  +  iip  +  ijm)  converts  bosons  to  fermions,  or  antifermions  to 
bosons (the p can, of course, be + or –). Multiplying by (–kE + iip + ijm) produces the 
reverse conversion of bosons to antifermions, or fermions to bosons. In conventional 
supersymmetry theory, boson contributions and fermion contributions are of opposite 
sign (with the operators having opposite signs of E) and automatically cancel in loop 
calculations.  The  present  theory  retains  this  advantage  without  requiring  extra 
(undiscovered) supersymmetric partners to the known fermions and bosons. 

The  spin  ½  state,  as  we  have  seen,  is  always  due  to  kinetic  energy,  implying 
continuous variation. and it is essentially that of the isolated fermion. Unit spin comes 
from  the  potential  energy  of  a  stable  state,  and  represents  either  a  boson  with  two 
nilpotents (which are not nilpotent to each other), or a bosonic-type state produced by 
a  fermion  interacting  with  its  material  environment  or  vacuum,  and,  as  a 
consequence,  manifesting  Berry  phase,  Thomas  precession,  relativistic  correction, 
radiation  reaction,  zitterbewegung,  or  whatever  else  is  needed  to  produce  the 
‘conjugate’  environmental  spin  state.  In  the  case  of  the  isolated  fermion  we  are 
treating the action half of Newton’s third law; in the case of the fermion interacting 
with  its  environment,  it  is  the  action  and  reaction  pair.  The  existence  of 
‘supersymmetric’  partners  seemingly  comes  from  the  duality  represented  by  the 
choice of fermion or fermion plus environment. 

In  this  context  it  is  significant  that,  while  the  Klein-Gordon  equation 
automatically applies to fermions as well as to bosons, the Dirac equation applies to 

 

31

 

 

 

‘spin  1’  particles  created  by  the  combination  of  fermion  plus  environment.  The 
consequences are the Berry phase, the Aharonov-Bohm effect, the Jahn-Teller effect, 
the quantum Hall effect, zitterbewegung, and other such phenomena. For a fermion or 
boson acting in this way with its ‘environment’, the supersymmetric operators do not 
demand an extra set of bosons or fermions; the coupling of fundamental particles to 
the vacuum becomes automatic in an infinite series of entangled states. 

22 Aharonov-Bohm effect 
 
The  Aharonov-Bohm  effect  can  be  considered  as  an  analogue  of  the  Jahn-Teller 
effect, and as another example of the effect of the Berry phase, but a consideration of 
this phenomenon suggests that it may lead to a more profound understanding of the 
meaning  of  the  factor  2  in  fundamental  physics.  In  the  Aharonov-Bohm  effect, 
electron interference fringes, produced by a Young’s slit arrangement, are shifted by 
half a wavelength in the presence of a solenoid whose magnetic field, being internal, 
does  not  interact  with  the  electron  but  whose  vector  potential  does.  The  half-
wavelength shift turns out to be a feature of the topology of the space surrounding the 
discrete flux-lines of the solenoid. This space is not simply-connected, that is, a circuit 
round the flux line cannot be deformed continuously down to a point. Effectively, the 
half-wavelength shift, or equivalent acquisition by the electron of a half-wavelength 
Berry phase, implies that an electron path between source and slit, round the solenoid, 
involves a double-circuit of the flux line (to achieve the same phase), and a path that 
goes  round  a  circuit  twice  cannot  be  continuously  deformed  into  a  path  which goes 
round once (as would be the case in a space without flux-lines). 

The  presence  of  the  flux  line  is  equivalent,  as  in  the  quantum  Hall  effect  and 
fractional quantum Hall effect, to the extra fermionic ½-spin which is provided by the 
electron  acting  in  step  with  the  nucleus  in  the  Jahn-Teller  effect  and  makes  the 
potential function single-valued, and the circuit for the complete system a single loop. 
It is particularly significant that the U(1) (electromagnetic) group responsible for the 
fact that the vacuum space is not simply connected is isomorphic to the integers under 
addition.  In  effect,  the  spin-½,  ½-wavelength-inducing  nature  of  the  fermionic  state 
(in the case of either the electron or the flux line) is a product of discreteness in both 
the  fermion  (and  its  charge) and  the space in which it acts. (The  U(1) group is also 
relevant  to  fermionic  states  with  zero  electric  charge,  through  the  SU(2)  ·
  U(1) 
mixing;  the  U(1)  component  may  even  be  considered,  in  such  cases,  as  a  necessary 
consequence  of  fermionic  discreteness.)  In  principle,  the  very  act  of  creating  a 
discrete particle requires a splitting of the continuum vacuum into two discrete halves 
(as with the bisecting of the rectangular figure with which we started), or (relating the 
concept  of  discreteness  to  that  of  dimensionality)  two  square  roots  of  0. 
(Mathematically, the identification of 1 as separate from 0 also implies that 1 + 1 = 2, 
reflecting the fact that physics and mathematics have a common origin in the process

of counting.)

23 Conclusion 
 
The  numerical  factor  2  has  become  an  almost  universal  component  of  fundamental 
physics, playing a significant role in both quantum theory and relativity. Its origin and 
meaning  can  be  explained 
relatively 
unsophisticated mathematics. In fact, the origin of the factor 2, in all significant cases 
–  classical,  quantum,  relativistic  –  is  in  the  virial  relation  between  kinetic  and 
potential  energies.  Careful  study  of  the  factor  reveals  that  it  is  the  link  between  the 
continuous and discrete physical domains, and their manifestations in many areas of 
stochastic  and  quantum 
physics. 
electrodynamics, Lorentz- and Einstein-type relativities, Schrödinger and Heisenberg 
versions  of  quantum  mechanics,  waves  and  particles,  spin  1/2  and  spin  1  units, 
fermions  and  bosons,  are  nothing  but  those  between  kinetic  and  potential  energies, 
between  averaged-out  changing  and  fixed  steady-state  values,  or,  indeed,  between 
triangles and rectangles.

terms,  using 

The result of all these cases is that kinetic energy variation may be thought of as 
continuous, but starting from a discrete state; potential energy variation, on the other 
hand,  is  a  discrete  variation,  starting  from  a  continuous  state.  Each  creates  the 
opposite  in  its  variation  from  itself.  Kinetic  energy  and  potential  energy  create  each 
other,  in  the  same  way  as  they  are  related  by  a  numerical  relationship.  We  can 
consider the kinetic energy relation to be concerned with the action side of Newton’s 
third  law,  while  the  potential  energy  relation  concerns  both  action  and  reaction. 
Because of the necessary relation between them, each of these approaches is a proper 
and complete expression of the conservation of energy. Ultimately, the factor 2 is an 
expression  of  the  discreteness  of  both  material  particles  (or  charges)  and  the  spaces 
between  them,  as  opposed  to  the  continuity  of  the  vacuum  in  terms  of  energy.  The 
same discreteness also implies (though more subtly) the concept of dimensionality. 

In more general terms, the factor 2 is an expression of a fundamental duality in 
nature,  and  duality  is  the  result  of  trying  to  create  something  from  nothing  –  the 
Aharanov-Bohm  effect is a  classic case, as is also the nilpotent algebra used for the 
fermion  wavefunction.  Fundamentally,  physics  does  this  when  it  sets  up  a  probe  to 
responds  with 
intrinsically  uncharacterizable  nature.  Nature 
investigate  an 
symmetrical  opposites  to  the  characterization  assumed  by  the  probe,  which,  in  its 
simplest  form,  is  constituted  by  a  discrete  point  in  space.  It  has  been  demonstrated 
previously that this generates a symmetrical group of fundamental parameters (space 
–  the  original  probe  –  time,  mass  and  charge  –  the  combined  response),  which  are 
defined  by  properties  which  split  the  parameters  into  three  C2  groupings,  depending 
on whether they  are conserved or nonconserved, real (or orderable) or imaginary (or 
nonorderable),  continuous  or  discrete.  Each  of  these  divisions  may  be  held

responsible for a factor 2, for duality seems to be the necessary result of any attempt 
at creating singularity. 

While the continuous or discrete duality is obvious from the distinction between 
potential  and  kinetic  energies,  this  distinction  also  incorporates  the  duality  between 
conserved  and  nonconserved  quantities  (or  fixed  and  changing  conditions).  The 
duality may also be expressed in terms of the distinction between space-like and time-
like  theories  (for  example,  those  of  Heisenberg  and  Schrödinger,  or  of  quantum 
mechanics and stochastic electrodynamics), which are not only distinguished by being 
discrete and continuous, but also by being real and imaginary. Though a single duality 
separates such theories, it is open to more than one interpretation because each pair of 
parameters is always separated by two distinct dualities. 

 
 
 

The very concept of duality implies that the actual process of counting is created 
at the same time as the concepts of discreteness, nonconservation, and orderability are 
separated  from 
those  of  continuity,  conservation,  and  nonorderability.  The 
mathematical processes of addition and squaring are, in effect, ‘created’ at the same 
time  as  the  physical  quantities  to  which  they  apply.  The  factor  2 expresses dualities 
which are fundamental to the creation of both mathematics and physics.

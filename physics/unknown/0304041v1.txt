Abstract

In this paper we present the concept of MPF, Message Passing Fluid, an abstract fluid where the

molecules move by mean of the informations that they exchange each other, on the basis of rules

and methods of a generalized Cellular Automaton. The model is intended for its simulation by mean

of message passing libraries on the field of parallel computing. We present a critical analysis of the

necessary computational effort in a possible implementation of such an object.

1.  Introduction

A  MPF,  Message  Passing  Fluid,  is  an  abstract  computational  model  of  fluid  into  which  the

molecules  move  on  the  basis  of  some  predefined  rules  which  prescribe  a  mutual  exchange  of

informations among the particles. A single molecule, once it has obtained these informations from

the other neighbouring molecules, computes the value of the physical quantities prescribed by the

rules  of  the  MPF,  and  moves  into  the  fluid  on  the  basis  of  an  appropriate  combination  of  such

values.

In  a  real  fluid  there  are  many  physical  quantities  which

determine the motion of the molecules. For the description of

the  intermolecular  relations  are  yet  determinant  some  short-

range  forces,  above  all  those  of  electromagnetic  nature,  that

the molecules exercise in a reciprocal manner by mean of an

exchange  of  informations.  For  example,  a  force  of  electric  nature  very  important  in  some  fluid

materials  is  the  strength  depending  from  the  Lennard-Jones  potential  or  from  the  Van  der  Waals

potential,  which  determines  an  attractive  action  between  particles  sufficiently  remote  and  a

repulsive action when the distance is smaller than a  definite  value  (v.  p.e.  [1],  where  is  offered  a

description for computational purposes).

Therefore a MPF, which is based by definition on the exchange of messages among molecules, can

be a tool for a computational interpretation of the intermolecular relations and for their influence on

the total motion of the fluid.

MPF can be simulated by mean of a 2D or 3D computational grid, and the exchange of informations

can be implemented by mean of opportune libraries as MPI, Message Passing Interface (v. p.e. [3]).

In  this  manner  the  simulation  can  profit  by  the  benefits  of  a  parallel  computing  environment:  as

shown  forward,  the  molecules  are  comparable  to  independent  processes  which  in  the  same

computational  step  exchange  informations  each  other.  Hence  a  MPF  can  be  considered  as  a

computational parallel environment.

This  paper  is  a  contribution  to the  study and  testing  of  possible  computational  models  and  to  the

research  for  a  description,  by  mean  of  Cellular  Automata  techniques,  of  the  numerous  real

phenomena characterized by complexity in the matter of fluids mechanics. For a justification and a

survey about the use of such methods on Computational Fluid Dynamics, one can see p.e. [2].

2.  The abstract model

In the MPF model the fluid is described by a n x m grid of quadratic equal cells in the 2D case, and

from a  n x m x h grid of cubic cells in the 3D case. The cells where the molecules can move are

inside a space delimited by walls, which are represented by geometric cells of the same kind too and

that constitute the physical boundary into which the fluid is contained. The molecules can receive

and send messages, which in the physical reality correspond to intermolecular forces  fields. Even

the  single  walls  cells  can  send  to  molecules  some  messages,  corresponding  to  forces  fields

especially of electromagnetic nature. In these first studied models we suppose that the walls don’t

receive messages from molecules. Therefore a MPF is first of all an object constituted by a grid, by

a set of molecules, by a messages field among molecules and by another messages field, of different

nature respect to the former, due to the possible presence of walls or obstacles. The messages that

the molecules can exchange each other concern for example with the positions occupied on the grid,

the potential values of the force field exercised in the interior of the fluid, the speeds and directions

of motion. The walls or other objects can send messages about the values of the potential relating to

the physical force that they exercise on the molecules. This force can be for example a repulsion of

electric nature that obstructs the physical penetrability among molecules of not affine materials. For

the  messages  exchange  is  useful  to  define  a  neighbourhood  relative  to  a  specific  fluid  molecule,

made  by  the  set  of  those  molecules  of  the  fluid  itself  and  if  necessary  of  those  of  the  extra-fluid

objects  which  can  exchange  messages  with  the  involved  molecule.  For  example,  in  the  2D  case,

such  neighbourhood  could  be  the  circle  centred  on  the  molecule  itself  and  having  as  radius  a

predefined value, as shown in Fig.1 .

Fig.1 A possible circular neighbourhood of a molecule for determining the objects to

which  send  messages  at  every  computational  step.  With  gray  shade  are  represented

the molecules of a wall or of an obstacle.

Moreover  one  should  define  the  rules  by  which  one  molecule  moves  itself,  on  the  basis  of  the

received messages. These rules are used for determining the cell of the grid where the molecule will

move,  after  the  receiving  of  the  relative  necessary  informations  by  mean  of  the  messages  of  the

objects contained in its neighbourhood. For example, a possible rule in the 2D case could require

the motion, among the eight cells adjacent to that where the molecule lies, to the cell where the sum

of the potential values received via message is minimum. As supplementary rule one might require

that, in the case that cell is already occupied, the molecule moves towards a cell immediately close

to that determined before, on the basis of a random choice between right and left, or up and down.

This  abstract  MPF  model  leaves  therefore  a  lot  of  free  will  for  the  choice  of  the  fundamental

characteristics:  type  of  physical  potentials,  molecular  neighbourhoods,  motion  rules.  For  every

choice of these characteristics one obtains a particular MPF, which might have no correspondence

with real physical situations; on the contrary for the possible study of a real fluid one should find

the more convenient characteristics for implementing an adequate MPF model.

3.  The computational model

One MPF has a native computational implementation by mean of techniques of messages passing

among  independent  processes  in  a  multithreading  program.  A  first  possible  ideal  computational

accomplishment might be so modelled:

•  every molecule corresponds to a process of the simulative program;

• 

the messages passing among the molecules is obtained by mean of interprocess calls to suitable

functions; therefore the fluid is represented by a set of parallel processes;

• 

for every computational step, a molecule, hence a process, sends its data to the other molecules

of the fluid, receives the data from the other objects contained in its neighbourhood, and then

calcules and determines its shifting on the grid on the basis of the predefined rules;

• 

the grid is completly computed with the new positions of the molecules, and the program move

to the next computational step.

Therefore a concrete computational realization of a MPF fluid requires the use of a message passing

library  in  a  parallel  architecture  program.  The  concrete  cases  that  we  have  studied  have  been

implemented by mean of the MPI library, interfaced to a C language program.

One  might  put  forward  the  following  remark:  in  a  simulation  with  a  high  number  of  involved

molecules,  the  number  of  processes  should  be  the  same  as  such  amount,  with  consequent

remarkable request of processors to obtain the desired degree of parallelism. This critical situation

can be managed using a balanced distribution of molecules to every single process, hence to every

single processor, for computing the new positions at every step.

A  second  remark  might  concern  with  the  considerable  number  of  messages  managed  by  the

processes. For example we assume that the fluid is composed by N molecules and that the number

of processes is P, a divisor of  N. At every computational step a process sends P-1 messages (in MPI

if we use the broadcast method the message is really only one), and it receives other P-1. Therefore

at every step, as the number of processes is P, the total number of exchanged messages depends on

P3.

A third remark concern with the number of necessary calculations for determining the motion of the

molecules towards the cells on the grid during a computational step. Fixed a molecule, for each step

the process that managed it must check which from the  (N/P)-1  molecules of the process itself and

which from the  (N/P)(P -1) of the other processes belong to the predefined neighbourhood of the

molecule; therefore, for every cell where the molecule itself can move, the process must compute

the  total  potential  due  to  the  presence  of  the  molecules  of  the  neighbourhood,  and  finally  find

among those calculated the necessary value, on the basis of the predefined rules, for determining the

motion. If we suppose that the neighbourhood of a molecule contains an average value A, constant

for a fixed grid, of molecules, and that the number of the candidate cells for the new position of the

molecule  is  B,  we  obtain  that  at  every  computational  step  the  number  of  calculations  for

determining all the new positions on the grid is

N

Therefore the number of calculation at every step depends on N2.

In total the computational effort, for one step, is proportional to  N2+P3. We now assume that the

number of used processors is P, hence is equal to the number of processes launched at runtime by

the simulation, and that the molecules of the flow at every step are  N=mP. Then, as the processors

can  work  in  parallel,  the  time,  in  calculation  unit,  necessary  for  the  execution  of  a  complete

computational step for the grid is proportional to
P3 + N2
P

m2 + P

and hence to m2. Therefore to simulate a MPF the described algorithm, native and not optimized,

presents a polynomial complexity of the second order.

I  present  now  a  first  simple  example,  from  which  one  deduces  that  the  MPF  model  can  be  an

adequate tool for the description of the behaviour of a real fluid during the motion.

This model shows the trajectory of a single molecule in a fluid that move along a canal on a plane

grid. Throughout its route there is a static obstacle. The motion of the molecule is regulated by the

following rules:

 i.  Every neighbourhood centred on the molecule is circular and has a radius of 4 grid units;

 ii.  At  every  computational  step  the  molecule  can  move  only  to  one  of  the  three  upper  cells

iii.  The  potential  of  an  object  that  is  in  the  position  (i,j)  of  the  grid,  as  regards  the  position

 

(p,q) occupied by the molecule, is determined by mean of the following formula:

the  new  position  of  the  molecule  is  computed  on  the  basis  of  the  minimum  of  the  total

neighbourhood centred on the molecule;

 v. 

if  the  destination  cell  is  already  occupied,  the  molecule  move  to  the  cell  having  a  potential

value immediately bigger of the computed minimum; if the three upper cells are all occupied,

the molecule doesn’t move.

At every computational step the objects of the neighbourhood send a message to the molecule with

an information relative to their position on the grid. The molecule computes for the upper free cells

the total potential, given by the sum of the partial. Hence it moves on the cell where the potential is

minimum. The trajectory of the molecule, which initially is placed on a cell adjacent to the wall, is

shown by the following Fig.2:

Fig. 2 Trajectory of a single molecule in the MPF material.

When  the  molecule  is  close  to  the  obstacle,  it  seems  pushed  far

away, in agreement to the electrostatic repulsion forces. Moreover

the trajectory respects the geometric shape of the canal into which

the molecule moves. In this model the behaviour of the molecule

seems to be sufficiently realistic to think that the MPF fluids can

represent a promising research tool for the study of real fluid dynamics situations.

The described example has been implemented by mean of a C program interfaced to MPI calls.

The program starts P independent processes; one of the processes traces in memory the position of

the molecule on the grid and sends it to the other P-1 processes by mean of the function MPI_Bcast;

these  processes  are  associated  to  the  static  objects  and  at  every  computational  step  transmit  via

MPI_Send  to  the  process-molecule  the  positions  of  the  object  contained  into  the  neighbourhood

centred  on  the  particle,  whose  process  computes  the  relative  potentials.  The  graphics  is  then

obtained  by  the  software  Mathematica,  which  elaborates  the  two-dimensional  array  representing

the grid, output of the C program. The Fig.2 is the result of a computation of about 10 seconds,

with P = 4, on the Beowulf-like Linux cluster at CINECA, Bologna, Italy.

5.  Possible further works

We are studying some implementations of the MPF model with a realistic number of molecules on

an arbitrary geometry. The computation is made on the Linux cluster of Cineca. Moreover we are

developing a possible generic library of MPI-like functions for the management of the messages in

a MPF.

A system containing a pre-steady state standard (non-autocatalytic) reaction, with

multiple paths, evolves toward a kinetic state with the minimum attainable activation

free energy. Displacement of the path frequency distribution in this transition was

shown to minimise the affinity linked to this change in activation free energy. In

damping this scalar force, a standard system is driven along a path of least action,

as previously established for a system of competing autocatalytic reactions. A kinetic

source of time asymmetry arises within the system, as the activation affinity moves

the system toward the most probable distribution of reaction paths. As the functions

of state are not changed by path displacement, a change of kinetic state cannot

produce chemical work. This generalises the notion of force to a scalar quantity

responsible for a displacement that does not yield work or heat. Spectrophotometric

observations reported on the transition to steady state kinetics during dinitrophenyl

phosphate phosphorolysis confirmed that time variations in the activation affinity are

non-positive.

1. Introduction

A deviation from the mean activation free energy for nucleotide condensation in a

heterogeneous population of competitively replicating polymers results in a path-

centred force (Davis, 1994, 1996) that shifts the polymer frequency distribution and

increases the rate of synthesis. Elimination of polymer species with suboptimal

template competence accounts for this increase (Kramer et al., 1974; Eigen et al.,

1989). In effect, nucleotide condensation tends to take place by progressively more

rapid reaction paths, or, equivalently, by more probable transition states. The system

thus evolves with time in the direction of the most probable kinetic state. 

This leads to the proposition that two independent sets of forces can orient a

chemical system in time. A scalar force that increases internal entropy accounts for

the thermodynamic orientation of a process in time. The time asymmetry in

competitive replication, and putatively in other pre-steady state chemical systems

(Laidler, 1987), however, arises from the spontaneous displacement of path

frequencies between a reactant and product state, which remain unaltered. In

addition to thermodynamic forces responsible for changes of state, therefore, a

chemical system also apparently contains path-centred forces that move it toward

the most probable set of paths between states.

It appeared of interest to establish that the proposed theory can be extended

to a change of kinetic state by a standard reaction. This would reveal whether

changes in a standard pre-steady state system (i) damp the activation affinity at a

maximal rate, and (ii) yield a path of least action, as in a set of autocatalytic

reactions. In contrast to evolution among competing autocatalytic reactions, where,

4

in principle, only the fastest reaction path is ultimately retained (Davis, 1996), all

available paths are retained during the transition to steady state kinetics by a

standard reaction. Moreover, steady state kinetics are achieved rapidly in the latter.

A transition interval of less than 200 ms, for instance, occurred in an enzyme

catalysed reaction (Trentham & Gutfreund, 1968) considered here. This compares

with a transition interval of nearly 3 hr in the RNA evolution experiment (Kramer et

al., 1974) investigated previously. For the same principles to govern a change of

kinetic state in two systems with such significant qualitative and quantitative

differences, they would have to apply in general. 

2. Transition to Steady State and the Activation Affinity

Each reaction path is seen to produce and consume an unstable intermediate, with

rate coefficients k . The frequency distribution of the set {T(i)} determines the 'kinetic

i

state' of system. For definiteness, a closed, isothermal system at constant volume is

considered. 

A change of kinetic state within the system may be linked to the presence of a

scalar force - the activation affinity. It reflects the difference in activation free energy,

The steady state constraint, requiring that the first step in (1) be rate limiting, is a

feature of the reaction. It implies that the formation of each T(i) involves reactant

activation. In the second step of (1), T(i) decomposes rapidly to product, at a rate

determined by 'diffusion' along the high energy segment,

The rate of a reaction, in which all paths are retained during a change of kinetic

state, is increased by addition of a path. Path number ordinarily increases with the

introduction of a catalyst. Total transition state concentration increases on passing

from an uncatalysed, T , to catalysed, T  + T , kinetic state. The change in activation

free energy requires only that the number of paths increase; transitions with a large

number of paths are conceivable. Conversely, a spontaneous decrease in path

number is excluded by (4). This would require that a standard system 

spontaneously shift to a less probable set of paths. The probability of this transition

decreases exponentially with the increase in activation free energy. A spontaneous

transition among competitive autocatalytic processes, by contrast, will exhibit a

significant reduction in path number. As slow paths are eliminated, the most

probable kinetic state then consists solely of the fastest reaction path!

A spontaneous change of kinetic state is characterised by a positive activation

affinity. From (2) and (3),

A positive kinetic force implies a transition state has a probability in the canonical

distribution of states that is higher than its pre-steady state probability. With

relaxation to the canonical distribution during reaction advancement, transition state

probability increases to its steady state level and the kinetic force vanishes. A

positive force of path displacement does not represent a potential for chemical work,

since system free energy is not altered by changes in path probability between A

and B states (1). A change of kinetic state thus involves a novel kind of force: a

scalar quantity linked to a displacement, which produces no work or heat. 

3. Force Damping by Pre-Steady State Changes  

It can be demonstrated that changes in path probability in a pre-steady state system

optimally damp the activation affinity.

Differentiation of (2) with respect to time reveals that the activation affinity is

damped as

Path frequency changes (8) accompanying the transition to steady state are

demonstrated in Appendix B to give a stationary value for the action. It was shown

above (section 3) that the activation affinity is minimised at each instant during this

transition. It is concluded from this finding that a stationary value for the action

(Appendix B) corresponds to the system following a path of least cost in terms of

action, while evolving toward steady state.  

5. Analysis of a Pre-Steady State Reaction

Spectrophotometric measurements of 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) formation on

phosphorolysis of 2,4-dinitrophenyl phosphate (DNPP), in the presence of alkaline

phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1), using the stop-flow technique (Trentham and Gutfreund,

1968)  illustrate the effect of a change of kinetic state on the kinetic force in a

standard reaction.

Figure 1 shows the rate of DNP formation at 25 C and pH 5.9 decreased over

time, with an effective first order rate coefficient of nearly 30 s . A decreased rate of

DNP formation accompanied reaction advancement, because dephosphorylation of

 As the transition state in the catalysed reaction, E-P.H O, increased toward its

nearly 14 kJ mol  at 0.1 ms, the force reduced to only 0.03 kJ mol  by 150 ms. Its

phosphorolysis was evaluated. The probability of catalysed and uncatalysed paths

for the pre-steady state interval relied on a steady state probability for the latter of

0.01. An interval of 153 ms was required to reach a catalysed path probability close

to 0.99. The action over this interval was 87 kJs mol .

Results presented earlier (section 2,3) establish that activation affinity damping

rates and the action obtained for the DNPP reaction, in its transition to steady state

kinetics, are extremal values.

6. Discussion

Changes in the path probability distribution of a standard reaction, with multiple

paths, could have been investigated at equilibrium. In this state, no thermodynamic

force acts on the system and no change occurs in reactant and product

concentration. The system is then effectively in a state of maximum symmetry

(Callen, 1974, 1985). In particular, it exhibits no time asymmetry of thermodynamic

origin. Addition of a catalyst to a chemical system at equilibrium, notwithstanding

thermodynamic invariance, elevates the rate of interconversion between reactant

and product molecules, to produce an effect similar to that observed on mixing

alkaline phosphatase and DNPP (section 5). In the presence of a catalyst the

system moves to a more probable kinetic state, as the path probability distribution of

a reaction shifts to lower the free energy of activation (section 2). 

During this transition, a chemical system at equilibrium changes in a preferred

direction with time. Since this time asymmetry arises in the absence of

13

thermodynamic forces, a  second source of time asymmetry evidently occurs within

the system. A second scalar force was identified: the activation affinity. This finding

adds to the number of known sources (Davies, 1974; Penrose, 1979; Schulman,

1996) of time asymmetry. 

Both thermodynamic and kinetic time asymmetries derive from statistical

displacement of a system. They reflect a probability difference between an initial and

final state, and forces of both types are damped as the system moves toward its

most probable state or set of reaction paths. At the most probable state consistent

with kinetic and thermodynamic constraints, these forces vanish and no further

change occurs. The amount of heat contained by a system, at a specified

temperature, is then maximised, in accord with the second law of thermodynamics.

In addition, kinetic theory requires that the rate of molecular interconversion is also

maximised, for a specified set of reaction paths.  

The activation affinity displaces a chemical system, without yielding either work

or heat. Shifting the path probability distribution between reactant and product state

causes no change in system free energy and, therefore, no change in work potential

(section 2). The concept of a kinetic force thus generalises the notion of force. It

requires inclusion of a scalar quantity responsible for a kind of displacement, which

is not coupled to work output. Similar to classical and quantum forces in a

conservative dynamical system (Feynman & Hibbs, 1965; Soper, 1976) and the

thermodynamic force (Shiner & Sieniutycz, 1994), the kinetic force was

demonstrated to move a system along the path of least action (section 3).

Darwinian evolution based on natural selection among competitively replicating

RNA molecules (Kramer et al., 1974) was shown to damp the activation affinity for

14

nucleotide condensation (Davis, 1996). This system evolved toward steady state

kinetics over an interval of 3 hr. In this time, the effective activation free energy for

nucleotide condensation decreased from 86.90 to 86.55 kJ mol . Consistent with the

-1

time dependence of the mean polymer formation rate coefficient (Davis, 1978), the

mean activation affinity, varied with the length of the replication interval, L,

decreasing from 0.33 to 0.0076 kJ mol  over 190 min. (L = 11400 s). The chemical

-1

affinity driving nucleotide condensation during polymerisation was held virtually

constant at 32.2 kJ mol , throughout the transition to steady state kinetics.

-1

Darwinian evolution under defined physical conditions thus damped the kinetic force

within a chemical system, moving the system toward the most probable (fittest)

reaction path. The principle of natural selection is seen to complement Boltzmann's

evolution principle, requiring that state-centred forces are damped with time by a

statistical mechanism.

theory (Pontryagin et al., 1962), changes in path probability specified by the state

equation (A1) will be shown to yield a stationary value for the action (B1).   

The cost variable adjoined to the state equation (A1) is

The control variable, s , specified by (B5), therefore, yields a stationary Hamiltonian.

Control theory indicates that a zero-valued Hamiltonian, over an interval with a freely

chosen final time,

$

 0, corresponds to a stationary value of the cost function. As

(B1) is the cost function for the pre-steady state transition, the path traced yields a

stationary action. It was previously established (Appendix A) that the activation

affinity, on which this action (B1) is based, is minimised at each instant throughout

the transition interval. Consequently, a pre-steady state system can be concluded to

follow a path of least action.

Abstract-- We study the distributions of dropped calls rates for 
different  wireless  (cellular)  carriers  in  different  markets.  Our 
statistics 
700  different  market/carrier 
combinations. We find that the dropped calls rates distribution is 
very  close  to  lognormal.  We  derive  an  equation  for  the  most 
probable  dropped  calls  rate  for  particular  carrier  in  particular 
market, which depends on the number of dropped calls observed, 
total  number  of  calls  and  the  parameters  of  the  lognormal 
distribution.  We apply this analysis to blocked and “no service” 
calls as well.

In  order  to  optimize  their  networks  and  to  benchmark 
themselves  against  competitors,  wireless  network  operators 
frequently  test  the  networks  using  mobile  test  equipment.  
During 
the  course  of  a  so-called  ‘drive-test’,  wireless 
telephone calls are placed from many locations throughout the 
network.    The  test  equipment  records  a  large  number  of 
statistics  associated  with  each  call,  including  whether  the  call 
went  through  or  was  blocked  and  whether  it  terminated 
normally  or  was  dropped.    The  results  are  used  both  to 
understand 
to  eliminate 
performance  problems.  The  drooped  calls  rate  is  one  of  the 
most important parameters of the quality of service [1]. 

the  end-user  experience  and 

Analyzing  the  drive  test  data  one  can  notice  that  for  some 
market/carrier  combinations  the  percentage  of  the  dropped 
calls  is  strictly  zero.  It  is  obvious  that  it  can’t  be  the  true 
dropped  calls  rate  just  because  everything  is  imperfect.    By 
looking closely at the data one sees that this occurs primarily 
in  markets  with  small  numbers  of  access  counts  as  is 
summarized in the table below.

 From the above table it is clear that no dropped calls were 
observed  because  not  enough  calls  had  been  made.  In  the 
present  paper  we  show  that  an  estimate  of  the  true  dropped 
calls rate can be obtained on the basis of the probability theory 
even in the case when no dropped calls has been observed. 

To start we shall illustrate the use of the probability theory 
on  a  simple  and  related  example.  The  following  problem  in 
one or other form can be found in any book of cute probability 
puzzles. 

Puzzle.  In  certain  city  10%  of  people  are  using  drugs  and 
90%  don’t.  A  certain  drug  test  gives  correct  result  in  90%  of 
cases  and  in  10%  therefore  wrong.  An  arbitrary  person  from 
that  city  was  administered  that  drug  test  and  it  was  positive. 
What is the probability that that person actually uses drugs? 

Solution. A heuristic one. The evidence that the person uses 
drugs, which comes from the drug test (9 to 1) is equal to the 
evidence that the person does not use drugs, which comes from 
the  drug  use  statistics  (also  9  to  1)  in  the  city.  Therefore  the 
probability  is  one  half.    A  rigorous  one.  Let’s  administer  the 
test to everybody in the city. It will be positive for 10% out of 
90%  non  drug-users  for  which  the  test  came  wrong  and  for 
90%  of  10%  drug-users  for  which  the  test  came  right.  We 
arrive to the same answer. 

How is this related to our problem? Directly. Instead of drug 
test  we  have  a  drive  test,  accuracy  of  which  depends  on  the 
number of the access counts, and we have the statistics of the 
dropped  calls  rates  for  over  700  market/carrier  combinations 
in our database.  

Let’s  have  a  look  at  this  statistics,  which  is  shown  in  the 

Figure 1.  

One  who  is  familiar  with  Statistics  can  immediately  notice 
that  the  distribution  in  the  Figure  1  is  lognormal  [2].  This 
means that it will look normal if we shall use the logarithmic 
coordinates. That this is true one can see from Figures 2 and 3 
(market/carrier  where  observed  dropped  rate  was  zero  had  to 
be  excluded  from  this  analysis).  Apart  from  visual  similarity 
the fact is supported by small values of skewness and kurtosis 
(see Table 2 in Appendix A). 

From the Figure 3 one can see that the actual distribution of 
dropped  calls  rate  can  be  approximated  by 
lognormal 
distribution  with  high  accuracy.    This  is  convenient  because 
is  completely  described  by 
lognormal  distribution 
two 
ln(x ( x is the drop calls rate) and 
)
parameters: mean value 
dispersion  s .  The mean value coincides with the maximum 

æ
Æ
   
 
of  the  bell-shaped  curve  of  the  normal  distribution  and  s   is 
the half-width of this bell.

Now  in  analogy  with  the  puzzle  at  the  beginning  of  the 
paper  we  assume  that  the  dropped  calls  rates  come  from  this 
distribution, the same way as that person came from a city with 
known drug use statistics.

Now let  us consider a concrete example. For Bell South in 
Athens,  GA  with  289  access  counts  no  dropped  calls  were 
observed.    What  is  the  true  drop  rate?  Suppose  that  it  is  the 
drop  rate  where  our  distribution  has  a  maximum  at 
ln(
.    The 
probability to have such drop rate is high, about 0.4. However 
if the drop rate is that, than the probability to observe no drops

that our guesses were not to good.

 To  get  the  most  likely  drop  rate  we  need  to  maximize  the 
product  of  the  probabilities  in  equations  (1)  and  (3)  with 
ln(x .    This  requires  a  calculation  (see  Appendix 
regard  to 
*x , is 

B), but the result is simple. The most probable drop rate,

Unfortunately, it can’t be solved analytically, except for one 
particular  case  N=0:  when  no  calls  have  been  made  than  the 
best guess which can be made of the dropped calls rate is the 
maximum of the lognormal distribution.

this  value  of  the  drop  rate  the  probability  density  of  both

improvement over 2 preceding figures.   

What  is  the  accuracy  of  this  estimate?  We  found  the  most

we  go  that  probability  become  considerably  less?  One  can 
show  (see  Appendix  B) 
inferred  probability 
that 
distribution  of  the  drop  rate  for  a  particular  market/carrier 
combination  is  given  by  a  lognormal  distribution  with  mean

Now  the  reader  might  be  concerned  that  the  figure  above 
does not match well with the mentioned few paragraphs above 
probability  density  0.03.  This  is  because  the  total  probability 
to observe zero drops out of 289 calls based on our drop calls 
statistics is not too high, about 0.046 (see the Appendix C). 

, 

The  same  technique  can  be  used  to  find  the  most  probable 
drop rate when it was not measured 0. Maximizing the product 
of equations 1 and 2 we obtain:

difference that now 

*x is a solution of the equation (6). 

The  same  analysis  applies  to  blocked  calls  rate  and  to  no 
service  percentage. As one can see from Figures 4 and 5 and 
from Table 2 the distributions of failed call rates are close to 
lognormal. The only difference from the case of dropped calls 
is different parameters of the lognormal distribution (they are 
given in the Table 2 in Appendix A) 

If the reader remembers the present discussion started from 
the statement that zero drop rate is impossible because nothing 
is perfect. This analysis is imperfect as well. It may be that the 
use of the nationwide statistics is not justified and one would 
better use market statistics, or may be nationwide statistics, but 
for particular carrier. However in that case we will end up with 
poorer statistics to find the parameters of the distribution.

The inferred probability distribution of the dropped call rate 
for  a  particular  market/carrier  combination  where  out  of  N 
calls  n  were  dropped  can  be  obtained  using  Bayes  equation

The  probability  to  observe  no  drops  in  N  calls  can  be 
obtained  by  integrating  the  product  of  the  probabilities  in

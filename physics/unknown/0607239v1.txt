Abstract: 

Optical  microcavities  trap  light  in  compact  volumes  by  the  mechanisms  of 
almost  total  internal  reflection  or  distributed  Bragg  reflection,  enable  light 
amplification, and select out specific (resonant) frequencies of light that can be 
emitted or coupled into optical guides, and lower the thresholds of lasing. Such 
resonators have radii from 1 to 100 µm and can be fabricated in a wide range 
of  materials.  Devices  based  on  optical  resonators  are  essential  for  cavity-
quantum-electro-dynamic  experiments, 
stabilization,  optical 
filtering and switching, light generation, biosensing, and nonlinear optics.

INTRODUCTION 

Optoelectronic  devices  based  on  optical  microresonators  that  strongly 
confine photons and electrons form a basis for next-generation compact-size, 
low-power  and  high-speed  photonic  circuits.  By  tailoring  the  resonator 
shape,  size  or  material  composition,  the  microresonator  can  be  tuned  to 
support  a  spectrum  of  optical  (i.e.,  electromagnetic)  modes  with  required 
polarization,  frequency  and  emission  patterns.  This  offers  the  potential  for

developing new types of photonic devices such as light emitting diodes, low-
threshold  microlasers,  ultra-small  optical 
for 
wavelength-division-multiplexed  (WDM)  networks,  colour  displays,  etc. 
Furthermore,  novel  designs  of  microresonators  open  up  very  challenging 
fundamental-science

technologies.  The  interaction  of  active  or  reactive  material  with  the  modal 
fields  of  optical  microresonators  provides  key  physical  models  for  basic 
research  such  as  cavity  quantum  electrodynamics  (QED)  experiments, 
spontaneous  emission  control,  nonlinear  optics,  bio  chemical  sensing  and 
quantum information processing (Yokoyama, 1992, 1995; Yamamoto, 1993; 
Chang, 1996;  Vahala, 2003). We  shall  briefly review  the  state-of-the-art  in 
microresonator  design  tools,  fabrication  technologies  and  observed  optical 
phenomena, and outline the challenges for future research.

MECHANISMS OF LIGHT CONFINEMENT AND 
RESONATOR BASIC FEATURES 

Optical  resonators  can  be  fabricated  by  exploiting  either  (almost)  total 
internal reflection (ATIR) of light at the interface between a dielectric (e.g. 
semiconductor)  material  and  the  surrounding  air  or  distributed  Bragg 
reflection  (DBR)  from  periodical  structures  such  as  multilayered  structures 
or  arrays  of  holes.  The  spectra  of  optical  modes  supported  by 
microresonators are shape and size dependent. The large variety of resonator 
geometries that can be realized by using either or combining both of the light 
confinement  mechanisms  opens  up  a  wide  field  of  research  and  device 
opportunities.  

For  various  applications  it  is  often  critical  to  realize  a  microresonator 
with  compact  size  (small  modal  volume,  V),  high  mode  quality  factor,  Q, 
and  large  free  spectral  range  (FSR).  Ultra-compact  microresonators  enable 
large-scale  integration  and  single-mode  operation  for  a  broad  range  of 
wavelengths. Q-factor is a measure of the resonator capacity to circulate and 
store  light,  and  is  usually  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  energy  stored  to  the 
energy dissipated in the microresonator. In practical device applications, the 
high  Q  of  the  microresonator  mode  translates  into  a  narrow  resonance 
linewidth,  long  decay  time,  and  high  optical  intensity.  Wide  FSR  (the 
spacing  between  neighbouring  high-Q  resonances)  is  often  required  to 
the  erbium  amplifier 
accommodate  many  WDM  channels  within 
communications window. The ratio Q/V  determines the strength of various 
light-matter interactions in the microresonator, e.g., enhancement of the

spontaneous  emission  rate,  and  should  be  maximised  for  microlaser 
applications  and  QED  experiments.  However,  high-Q  microresonators  of 
optical-wavelength size are difficult to fabricate, as the WG-mode Q-factors 
decreases exponentially with the cavity size, and thus in general the demands 
for a high Q-factor and compactness (large FSR, small V) are contradictory. 
A very wide range of microresonator shapes has been explored over the 
years for various applications (Table 1 lists some of the most popular optical 
microresonator  types  as  well  as  their  dominant  modes  and  basic  features). 
The most widely used are rotationally symmetric structures such as spheres, 
cylinders, toroids, and disks, which have been shown to support very high-Q 
whispering-gallery  (WG)  modes  whose  modal  field  intensity  distribution  is 
concentrated  near  the  dielectric-air  interface  (Fig.  2).  Silica  microspheres 
exhibit 
the  highest  (nearly  9  billion)  Q-factors  (Braginsky,  1989; 
Gorodetsky, 1996; Vernooy, 1998; Laine, 2001; Lefevre-Seguin, 1997), yet 
have  a  very  dense  spectrum  of  multiple-degenerate  WG  modes,  which 
complicates  their  application  for  spectral  analysis  or  laser  stabilization. 
Recently proposed micro-toroidal resonators (Ilchenko, 2001; Armani, 2003; 
Vahala, 2003; Polman, 2004) not only demonstrate very high WG-mode Q-
factors approaching those of microspheres but also enable reduction of WG-
mode volume, increase of resonator FSR, and on-chip integration with other 
components.

Circular  high-index-contrast  microring  and  microdisk  resonators  based 
on planar waveguide technology with diameters as small as 1-10 μm are able 
to  support  strongly-confined  WG  modes  with  typical  Q-factors  of  104-105 
and  are  widely  used  as  microlaser  cavities  (Levi,  1993;  Baba,  1997,  1999; 
Cao, 2000; Zhang, 1996) and add/drop filters for WDM networks (Hagness, 
1997; Little, 1997, 1999; Chin, 1999). Recently, record Q-factors have been 
demonstrated in wedge-edge microdisk resonators (Q in excess of 1 million, 

Micro-optical Resonators 
 
Kippenberg,  2003)  and  in  polished  crystalline  microcavities  (Q>1010, 
Savchenkov, 2004).

Along with circular microdisk resonators, cavities of elliptical (Noeckel, 
1994;  Backes,  1999;  Boriskina,  2003;  Kim,  2004),  quadrupolar  (Noeckel, 
1994; Gmachl, 1998;  Fukushima, 2004; Gianordoli,  2000; Chin, 1999) and 
square  (Poon,  2001;  Ling,  2003;  Manolatou,  1999;  Hammer,  2002;  Fong, 
2003;  Guo,  2003;  Boriskina,  2004,  2005)  shapes  have  attracted  much 
interest.  Depending  on  their  size  and  degree  of  deformation,  these 
microresonators  can  support  several 
types  of  optical  modes  with 
significantly  different  Q-factors,  near-field  intensity  distributions,  and 
emission  patterns  (WG-like  modes  in  square  resonators  (Fig.  2a),  bow-tie 
modes  in  quadrupoles  (Fig.  2b),  distorted  WG  modes,  volume  and  two-
bounce oscillations, etc.). Such resonators offer advantage for various filter

modes,  directional  light  emission  and  more  efficient  microresonator-to-

Planar  photonic  crystal  (PC)  microcavities  (Fig.  2c),  formed,  e.g.,  as 
arrays  of  air  holes  etched  into  a  slab,  have  been  demonstrated  to 
simultaneously  exhibit  high  Q-factors  and  ultra-small,  wavelength-scale 
modal  volumes  (Foresi,  1997;  Benisty,  1999;  Chow,  2000;  Yoshie,  2001; 
Kim,  2002;  Akahane,  2003;  Srinivasan,  2004;  Noda,  2000;  Painter,  1999; 
Boroditsky, 1999). In these cavities, the photonic-bandgap effect (fulfilment 
of  the  Bragg  reflection  conditions  for  all  the  propagation  directions  in  a 
certain  frequency  range)  is  used  for  strong  light  confinement  in  the  cavity 
plane, and TIR, for light confinement at the air-slab interface (Russel, 1996; 
Krauss, 1999). Modern fabrication technologies enable precise control of the 
PC  cavity  geometry,  and  the  inherent  flexibility  in  hole  shape,  size,  and

pattern  makes  fine-tuning  of  the  defect  mode  wavelengths,  Q-factors,  and 
emission patterns possible (Painter, 2001; Coccioli, 1998).  

Trevor M. Benson et al. 

In  micropost  and  micropillar  resonators  (Gayral,  1998;  Solomon,  2001; 
Pelton,  2002;  Benyoucef,  2004;  Santori,  2004),  the  transverse  mode 
confinement  is  due  to  TIR  at  the  semiconductor-air  interface,  while 
confinement  in  the  vertical  direction  is  provided  by  a  pair  of  distributed 
Bragg  reflectors.  Thus,  these  microresonator  structures  can  be  seen  as  1-D 
PC  defect  cavities  in  a  fibre.  They  support  Fabry-Perot-type  modes  with 
relatively  high  Q-factors  and  small  modal  volumes,  which  makes  them 
promising  candidates  for  microlaser  applications  and  the  observation  of 
cavity-QED phenomena.  

Other  types  of  optical  microcavities  employing  the  DBR  mechanism  of 
light confinement include planar annular Bragg resonators (Scheuer, 2005), 
based  on  a  radial  defect  surrounded  by  Bragg  reflectors,  and  their  3-D 
equivalent, spherical Bragg “onion” resonators (Liang, 2004).

Progress 
fabrication  of  high-quality  optical 
microresonators  is  closely  related  to  the  development  of  novel  optical 
materials  and 
for 
microresonator fabrication include silica, silica on silicon, silicon, silicon on 
insulator,  silicon  nitride  and  oxynitride,  polymers,  semiconductors  such  as 
GaAs,  InP,  GaInAsP,  GaN,  etc,  and  crystalline  materials  such  as  lithium 
niobate and calcium fluoride. Table 2 summarises the optical characteristics 
of these materials (see Eldada, 2000, 2001; Hillmer, 2003; Poulsen, 2003 for 
more detail). 

Silica  glass  is  a  widely  used  resonator  material,  which  combines  the 
advantage of a very low intrinsic material loss, a large transparency window, 
and  compatibility  with  standard  fibre-optic  technologies,  e.g.,  efficient 
coupling  to  optical  fibres  (Sandoghdar,  1996;  Gorodetsky,  1996;  Laine, 
2001;  Cai,  2000;  Ilchenko,  2001).  The  silica-on-silicon  technology  that 
involves  growing  silica  layers  on  silicon  substrates  is  one  the  most  widely 
used technologies to fabricate planar microresonator devices (Eldada, 2001; 
Kippenberg,  2003;  Armani,  2003;  Polman,  2004),  although  microring 
resonators  made  of  compound  glasses  (Ta2O5-SiO2)  have  also  been 
demonstrated (Little,  1999).  A glass  platform  is relatively inexpensive, and 
as the index contrasts are smaller than for semiconductors, larger-size single-
mode resonators can be fabricated by using cheaper lithographic techniques. 
However, wavelength-scale resonators with wide FSR in high-index-contrast 
silicon or silicon-on-insulator material systems (Little, 1998; Akahane, 2003; 
Dumon,  2004)  are  crucial  for  ultra-compact  integration  of  photonic 

Micro-optical Resonators 
 
integrated circuits. Another relatively new planar resonator platform is based 
on  using  silicon  nitride  and  oxynitride  (Krioukov,  2002;  Melloni,  2003; 
Barwicz,  2004).  It  enables  the  index  contrast  to  be  adjusted  by  as  much  as 
30% by changing the resonator material composition in between that of SiO2 
and Si3N4.

Of  course,  GaAs,  InP,  and  GaN-  based  semiconductors  have  attracted 
much attention as the materials for microresonator device fabrication (Baba, 
1997; Hagness, 1997; Solomon, 2001; Gianordoli, 2000; Kim, 2002; Painter, 
1999; Grover, 2001, 2004; Zhang, 1996; Kneissl, 2004), as they enable very 
compact  resonator  structures  that  can  perform  passive  (coupling,  splitting 
and  multiplexing)  and  active  (light  generation,  amplification,  detection, 
modulation)  functions  in  the  same  material  system.  Most  semiconductor 
microdisk  and  planar  PC  resonators  consist  of  thin  heterostructure  layers. 
Such structures enable local modification of the energy-band structure of the 
semiconductor  (quantum  wells)  and  thus  control  of  the  material  emission 
wavelength  (Einspruch,  1994).  Recently,  there  has  been  a  lot  of  interest  in 
semiconductor resonators with artificially engineered material band structure 
based  on 
low-dimensional  heterostructures,  such  as  one-dimensional 
quantum wires and zero-dimensional quantum boxes/dots (Arakawa, 1986). 

Polymer materials (Eldada, 2000; Rabiei, 2002, 2003; Chao, 2003, 2004) 
offer great potential for use in advanced optoelectronic systems as they offer 
low  material  costs,  up  to  35%  tunability  of  the  refractive  index  contrast, 
excellent  mechanical  properties,  very  low  optical  loss,  large  negative 
thermo-optic  coefficient  and 
low-cost  high-speed  processing.  Other 
attractive materials for high-Q microresonators fabrication, which combine a 
wide  optical  transparency  window,  a  good  electro-optic  coefficient  and 
nonlinearity,  are  crystalline  materials  such  as  calcium  fluoride  and  lithium 
niobate (Ilchenko, 2002; Savchenkov, 2004, 2005). 

In  addition  to  semiconductor  materials  discussed  above,  there  are  other 
material  systems 
in  which  electroluminescence  has  already  been 
demonstrated, even in the visible wavelength range. These materials include:

microporous  silicon  fabricated  by  electrochemical  etching  of  crystalline 
silicon  wafers  in  a  hydrofluoric  acid  (Chan,  2001),  Erbium-doped  silicon 
(Polman, 2004; Hillmer, 2003; Gardner, 2005), phosphate glass (Cai, 2000) 
and organic materials, e.g., para-phenylene-vinylene (Krauss, 1999; Hillmer, 
2003).  Furthermore,  polymers  that  are  not  intrinsically  functional  can  be 
doped  with  organic  laser  dyes,  rare-earth  light-amplifying  complexes,  and 
laser 
electro-optic  dyes.  Such  materials  can  be  used 
microresonators and have an advantage over III-V semiconductors in either 
compatibility with silicon microelectronics or cost and ease of fabrication.

FABRICATION TECHNOLOGY 

Recent  advances  in  nanofabrication  technology  offer  the  possibility  of 
manufacturing novel optical  microresonator devices with dimensions of the 
order of the optical wavelength in a variety of natural and artificial material 
systems.  Integrated  micro-ring  and  micro-disk  resonators  as  well  as  PC 
defect  microcavities  are  usually  micro-fabricated  on  wafer  substrates  using 
lithographic  and  etching 
well-developed 
techniques  (Elliott,  1989).  During  the  fabrication  process,  wafers  are 
typically  cycled  through  three  main  steps:  wafer  preparation,  lithography, 
and  etching.  Some  of  these  steps  may  be  repeated  at  various  stages  of  the 
fabrication  process.  A  schematic  drawing  of  a  typical  micro-resonator 
fabrication sequence is presented in Fig. 3. 

integrated-circuit  deposition, 

The  first  stage  of  the  fabrication  process  (wafer  preparation)  usually 
involves the growth or deposition of material layers of different composition 
to  create  vertical  layered  structures  able  to  support  guided  waves.  The 
layered  structure  might  be  formed  using  various  wafer  growth  techniques, 
such as molecular beam epitaxy, chemical or physical vapour deposition, or 
wafer bonding, depending on the material system. The choice of the growth 
technique  depends  on  the  desired  resonator  structure,  material  system,  and 
required  precision.  For  example,  semiconductor  materials  usually  require 
several  successive  growths  to  make  the  vertical  structure,  while  polymer 
layers can simply be sequentially spun onto a substrate. 

Molecular  beam  epitaxy  (MBE)  is  an  expensive  yet  widely  used 
technique  for producing epitaxial layers of  metals, insulators  and III-V and 
II-VI  based  semiconductors,  both  at  the  research  and  the  industrial 
production  level  (Herman,  1996).  It  consists  of  deposition  of  ‘molecular 
beams’  of  atoms  or  clusters  of  atoms,  which  are  produced  by  heating  up  a 
solid source, onto a heated crystalline substrate in ultra-high vacuum. MBE 
is characterized by low growth temperatures and low growth rates and thus 
enables  producing  high-precision  epitaxial  structures  with  monolayer

control. Other wafer growth techniques include chemical vapour deposition 
(Foord,  1997)  of  reactant  gases  broken  down  at  high  temperatures,  which 
can  be  used  to  deposit  GaN,  GaInAsP,  Si,  SiO2,  Si3N4,  and  polymer 
materials;  sputter  (or  physical  vapour)  deposition,  which  is  a  process  of 
controlled  deposition  of  energetic  ionized  particles  of  SiO2,  Si3N4,  metals, 
and alloys (Little, 1999); and wafer bonding, or fusing of two materials (e.g., 
Si to glass, Si to Si, III-V semiconductors to SiN or SiO2) at the atomic level 
(Tishinin, 1999).

A  resonator  structure  is  then  imaged  onto  a  wafer  through  a  multi-step 
lithography  process.  To  make  the  wafer  (usually  covered  by  a  thin  oxide 
film) sensitive to an image, a photoresist is spread on the wafer by a process 
called  spin  coating.  Then,  a  photomask  (a  glass  emulsion  plate  with  a 
resonator  pattern)  is  placed  on  top  of  the  wafer.  Light  is  projected  through 
the  voids  in  the  photomask  and  images  the  mask  pattern  on  the  wafer. 
Several types of lithography with various resolutions can be used depending 
on  the  resonator  type,  size,  and  fabrication  tolerances:  optical  (λ=160-430 
nm; feature size ~ 0.13 μm), extreme ultraviolet (λ=13 nm; feature size ~ 45 
nm),  X-ray  (λ=0.4-4  nm;  feature  size  ~  25  nm),  or  electron  (ion)  beam 
(λ=0.03 Ǻ; feature size ~ 10-20 nm). When exposed to light, the resist either 
polymerizes  (hardens)  (if  a  negative  resist  is  used)  or  un-polymerizes  (if  a 
positive resist is used). After exposure, the wafer is developed in a solution 
to dissolve the excess resist. 

Once  the  resist  has  been  patterned,  the  selected  regions  of  material  not 
protected  by  photoresist  are  removed  by  specially  designed  etchants, 
creating the resonator pattern in the wafer. Several isotropic (etching occurs 

Trevor M. Benson et al.

in  all  directions  at  the  same  etch  rate)  and  anisotropic  (directional)  etching 
processes  are  available.  Wet  chemical  etching  is  an  isotropic  process  that 
uses  acid  solutions  to  selectively  dissolve  the  exposed  layer  of  silicon 
dioxide.  However,  to  produce  vertical  resonator  sidewalls,  anisotropic  dry 
etching  is  required.  In  the  most  commonly  used  dry  etching  technique, 
plasma  etching,  ions  reacting  with  atoms  of  the  wafer  are  created  by 
generating  plasma  by  rf  discharge.  Dry  etching  techniques  also  include 
sputter etching, ion milling, reactive etching, and reactive ion beam etching. 
Another type of anisotropic etching technique is anodic etching - wet etching 
with  an  applied  electric  field.  After  the  etching  process,  the  remaining 
photoresist  is  removed.  In  most  cases,  several  etching  techniques  are 
combined  to  form  a  desired  resonator  structure.  For  example,  in  the 
fabrication  of  microdisk  resonators  mounted  on  posts  (Baba,  1997)  or  2-D 
PC  microcavities  (Painter,  1999;  Hennesy,  2003),  the  pattern  is  first 
transferred  into  a  heterostructure  by  an  anisotropic  dry  etch  and  then  a 
microdisk or a PC cavity membrane is released by selective wet etching of 
the substrate. 

technique 

the  most  common 

Microsphere  resonators  can  also  be  manufactured  with  standard  wafer 
processing technologies. Usually, silicon posts topped with silica blocks are 
created on the wafer and then are molten into spherical shapes by controlled 
heating.  However, 
to  fabricate  silica 
microsphere resonators of several hundred microns in diameter is to simply 
melt  a  tip  of  an  optical  fibre  by  hydrogen  flame  or  electric  arc  heating 
(Braginsky,  1989;  Sandoghdar,  1996;  Gorodetsky,  1996;  Laine,  2001).  To 
fabricate microspheres of smaller diameters, the fibre can first be thinned by 
tapering  or  etching  (Cai,  2000).  In  the  heating  process,  once  the  silica 
temperature  passes  the  melting  point,  the  surface  tension  forces  shape  the 
fused  silica  into  a  near-perfect  spherical  form.  After  the  sphere  is  removed 
from  the  flame,  solidification  occurs  almost  instantaneously.  The  resulting 
microsphere  has  extremely  smooth  surface  with  Angstrom-scale  surface 
deformations resulting in very high Q-factors of the WG modes. 

Similar  technique  can  also  be  used  to  fabricate  silica  microtorus 
resonators  by  compressing  a  small  sphere  of  low-melting  silica  glass 
between cleaved fibre tips (Ilchenko, 2001). The combined action of surface 
tension  and  axial  compression  results  in  the  desired  toroidal  geometry. 
Recently, a process for producing silica toroidal-shaped microresonators-on-
a-chip  with  Q  factors  in  excess  of  100  million  by  using  a  combination  of 
lithography,  dry  etching  and  a  selective  reflow  process  have  been 
demonstrated  (Armani,  2003).  By  selectively  heating  and  reflowing  a 
patterned  and  undercut  microdisk  with  the  use  of  a  CO2  laser  a  toroidal 
resonator with the atomically smooth surface was obtained. 

Micro-optical Resonators 
 

49

The  thermal-reflow  process  (or  hot  embossing)  has  also  been  used  to 
reduce  significantly  sidewall  surface  roughness  in  polymer  (polystyrene) 
microring resonators (Chao, 2004). This is a very useful technique because it 
enables  post-fabrication 
fine-tuning  of  microresonator  performance. 
However, for the fabrication of complex, multilayer devices this procedure is 
less useful as the high temperatures needed to reflow the polymer film could 
also disturb lower cladding layers and possibly alter optically active dopant 
molecules. 

A  need  for  submicron-scale  patterning  as  well  as  stringent  etching 
tolerances of conventional fabrication  techniques often result  in either very 
high  fabrication  costs  or  high  scattering  losses  and  frequency  detuning  in 
microresonator-based devices. An emerging lithographic technology that can 
achieve sub-10 nm pattern resolutions beyond the limitations set by the light 
diffractions  or  beam  scatterings 
is  a 
in 
nanoimprint  technique  (Chou,  1996;  Guo,  2004).  Based  on  the  mechanical 
embossing principle, nanoimprint technology is used not only to create resist 
patterns  as  in  lithography  but  also  to  directly  pattern  microresonator 
structures  in  polymers.  Nanoimprinting  utilizes  a  hard  mould  (which  plays 
the  same  role  as  the  photomask  in  photolithography)  with  predefined 
nanoscale features to mechanically imprint into a heated polymer film. The 
created  thickness  contrast  pattern  is  `frozen’  into  the  polymer  during  a 
cooling cycle. 

the  conventional  methods 

Recently,  as  processing  techniques  for  the  synthesis  of  monodispersed 
nanoparticles  of  various  shapes  have  matured,  considerable  effort  has  been 
directed  to  study  the  mechanisms  of  their  self-assembly  as  an  inexpensive 
and  fast  method  of  fabrication  of  photonic  structures.  Electrostatic  self-
assembly  is  an  emerging  technology  that  can  create  microresonator 
structures  with  tailored  optical  properties.  For  example,  self-assembled 
arrays  of  polystyrene  microspheres  coupled  to  each  other  and  to  rib 
waveguides  are  expected  to  or  already  find  application  in  wavelength 
selection  (Tai,  2004),  waveguiding  (Astratov,  2004),  optical  sensing,  and 
optical delays. Finally, recent advances in polishing techniques have allowed 
the fabrication of large (~5 mm-diam & 100-micron thick) disk and toroidal 
microresonators of crystalline materials, such as lithium niobate and calcium 
fluoride (Ilchenko, 2002; Savchenkov, 2005) that find use as high-efficiency 
microwave and millimetre-wave electro-optical modulators.

Integration with other components 

One  of  the  most  difficult  challenges  in  the  design  and  fabrication  of 
integrated  microresonator-based  photonic  devices  and  systems  is  the 
efficient  coupling  of  light  into  and  out  of  a  microresonator  without 
compromising  its  narrow  resonance  linewidth.  Furthermore,  the  cost  and 
robustness  of  fabrication,  simplicity  of  the  microresonator-to-coupler 
alignment as well as ability to provide on-chip integration are very important 
factors  in  the  development  of  advanced  microresonator  couplers.  The  most 
widely  used  microresonator  coupling  devices  are  evanescent-field  couplers 
of  various  geometries  such  as  prisms,  tapered  fibres,  planar  and  PC 
waveguides, etc. (see Fig. 4).

Figure 4. Various types of microresonator coupling devices. 

The efficiency of optical power transfer in/out of a microresonator can be 
controlled  by  manipulating  the  overlap  between  the  resonator  and  coupler 
mode  fields,  matching  of  the  mode  propagation  constants,  or  changing  the 
length  of  the  evanescent-field  coupling  region.  Prisms  have  traditionally 
been  used  to  couple  light  into  microspheres  (Gorodetsky,  1996;  Vernooy, 
1998)  and  more  recently,  to  square  resonators  (Pan,  2003),  although  they 
require bulk optics for focusing and alignment of the light source. Coupling 
to  microsphere  (Serpenguzel,  1995;  Cai,  2000;  Spillane,  2002)  and

Micro-optical Resonators 
 
microtoroid  resonators  (Kippenberg,  2004)  through  tapered  fibres  has 
several distinct advantages such as the built-in coupler alignment, relatively 
simple fabrication, possible on-chip integration, and control of the coupling 
efficiency by the change of the fibre thickness. However, integrated, wafer-
fabricated  microresonators  are  usually  coupled  into  a  photonic  circuit 
through  either  planar  (rib)  waveguides  (Hagness,  1997;  Little,  1997,  1999; 
Chin, 1999; Grover,  2004; Zhang,  1996; Melloni, 2003) or PC waveguides 
(Noda, 2000).  

The  very small size  and  strong optical  confinement  of  integrated  planar 
microdisk and microring resonators, which make them promising candidates 
for  large  scale  integration,  also  make  them  very  sensitive  to  fabrication 
errors  that  can  drastically  spoil  coupling  efficiency.  For  example,  if  a 
circular microdisk is laterally coupled to a waveguide via a submicron-width 
air gap, the coupling efficiency strongly depends on the gap width. Accurate 
and repeatable  fabrication of such narrow gaps by lithographic and etching 
techniques is a rather challenging task. The smaller the microdisk, the more 
difficult  it  is  to  control  the  coupling  coefficient.  For  2–5  μm-sized 
microdisks, the resolution of the fabrication method is often not high enough 
to achieve the desired narrow air gaps (<0.1 μm), and to enhance coupling, 
microdisks  are  fused  to  bus  waveguides  (Grover,  2004).  Efficient  lateral 
coupling  across  wider  air  gaps  can  be  achieved  by  increasing  the  coupling 
interaction  length  by  either  curving  the  adjacent  waveguide  along  the 
microdisk  (Zhang,  1996;  Hagness,  1997;  Chin,  1998)  or  using  elliptical, 
racetrack  or  square  microresonators  (Chin,  1999;  Boriskina,  2003; 
Manolatou,  1999;  Hammer,  2002;  Fong,  2003).  It  has  been  also  predicted 
that resonator-waveguide coupling may be enhanced by exploiting the higher 
field  concentration  at  the  increased-curvature  portion  of  an  elliptical 
microdisk resonator (Boriskina, 2003).  

5.2  Wavelength-selective components for WDM systems 

Microdisk,  microring,  and  PC  defect  resonators  are  versatile  building 
blocks  for  very  large  scale  integrated  photonic  circuits,  as  they  are  ultra 
  devices/cm2)  and  can  perform  a  wide  range  of  optical  signal 
compact  (105
processing  functions  such  as  filtering,  splitting  and  combining  of  light, 
switching  of  channels  in  the  space  domain,  as  well  as  multiplexing  and 
demultiplexing of channels in the wavelength domain.  

Wavelength-selective bandstop (Fig. 5a) or add/drop (Fig. 5b) filters that 
can  combine  or  separate  different  wavelengths  of  light  carrying  different 
information are essential components for controlling and manipulating light 
in optical transmission systems. High-Q microdisks/microrings evanescently 
coupled  to  bus  waveguides  have  been  extensively  explored  for  WDM

channel  dropping  due  to  their  ability  to  select  a  single  channel  with  a  very 
narrow linewidth (Hagness, 1997; Little, 1997, 1999; Chin, 1999; Boriskina, 
1999; Grover, 2004). To compromise between the requirements for a narrow 
channel  linewidth,  structure  compactness,  and  wide  FSR,  the  radii  of  the 
microresonators  used  in  filters  are  usually  in  between  5  and  30  micron, 
resulting  in  filters  with  a  FSR  of  20-30  nm.  By  using  PC  defect 
microcavities, further miniaturization of optical filters can be achieved (Fan, 
1998). PC-microcavity filters can be realized by either introducing a single 
defect in the vicinity of the PC waveguide (Noda, 2000) or by integrating PC 
defect  microcavities  directly  into  a  submicrometre-scale  silicon  waveguide 
(Foresi, 1997; Chow, 2004).

An  ideal  filter  should  have  a  box-like  spectral  response  with  a  flat 
passband,  sharp  roll-off  from  passband  to  stop  band,  and  large  out-of-band 
rejection.  However, 
single 
microresonator  is  a  series  of  Lorentzian-shape  sharp  resonance  peaks  at 
wavelengths  corresponding  to  the  excitation  of  the  high-Q  modes  in  the 
microresonator (Fig. 5c). For closely spaced channels, however, a Lorentzian 
response  may not provide  adequate roll-off  to  minimize cross-talk between 
different  channels.  To  overcome  this  limitation,  higher-order  filters  formed 
by  cascading  multiple  resonators  have  been  introduced  (Little,  1997; 
Hryniewicz, 2000; Grover, 2002; Melloni, 2003; Savchenkov, 2003, 2005). 
Such filters have flat responses around resonances, much faster roll-off, and 
larger  out-of-band  signal  rejection.  Vernier  filter  tuning  by  combining 

a 

Micro-optical Resonators 
 
microring  resonators  of  different  radii  has  also  been  successfully  used  to 
suppress non-synchronous resonances of different microrings and extend the 
resulting filter FSR (Yanagadze, 2002).

Optical  characteristics  of  active  microresonators  (and  thus  spectral 
properties  of  the  resonator-based  filters)  can  be  dynamically  tuned  by 
changing their refractive indices, for example, by using the thermo-optic or 
electro-optic  effects.  Tunable  microring  resonators  have  been  used  to 
demonstrate  optical  modulation  using  the  electro-optic  effect  in  polymer 
(Rabiei,  2002),  all-optical  switching  using  free-carrier  injection  in  GaAs–
AlGaAs (Ibrahim, 2003), and absorption-induced wavelength switching and 
routing  (Little,  1998).  Furthermore,  significant  enhancement  of  non-linear 
effects  in  microresonators  made  possible  the  demonstration  of  Kerr 
nonlinear phase shift (Heebner, 2004) and optical wavelength switching and 
conversion (Absil, 2000; Melloni, 2003) in microresonator structures.  

Linear  arrays  of  optical  microresonators  evanescently  coupled  to  each 
other  can  also  be  used  for  optical  power  transfer  (Fig.  6).  This  type  of  
coupled-resonator  optical  waveguide  (CROW)  has  recently  been  proposed 
(Yariv, 1999) and then demonstrated and studied in a variety of material and 
geometrical  configurations,  such  as  sequences  of  planar  microrings  (Poon, 
2004),  arrays  of  coupled  microspheres  (Astratov,  2004),  and  chains  of 
photonic crystal defect cavities (Olivier, 2001).

Among  the  advantages  offered  by  CROWs  is  the  possibility  of  making 
reflection-less  waveguide  bends  as  well  as  a  significant  slowing  of  light 
pulses. Reduction of the light group velocity in CROWs can be explored in a 
variety of optical applications such as delay lines, optical memory elements, 
and  components  for  nonlinear  optical  frequency  conversion,  second-
harmonic  generation  and  four-wave  mixing  (Poon,  2004;  Melloni,  2003; 
Heebner, 2004; Mookherjea, 2002).

Biochemical sensors 

Trevor M. Benson et al. 

Microresonators  supporting  high-Q  modes  also  have  great  potential  in  the 
development of inexpensive, ultra-compact, highly sensitive and robust bio- 
and  chemical  sensors  on  a  chip.  As  compared  to  linear  optical  waveguide 
biosensors,  microresonator-based  devices  benefit  from  much  smaller  size 
(several  μm  rather  than  a  few  centimetres)  and  higher  sensitivity.  Several 
phenomena  can  be  used 
for  detection.  For  example,  cylindrical 
microresonators, operating on the WG modes, have been shown to enhance 
the  intensity  of  the  fluorescence  emitted  by  biological  materials  (Blair, 
2001).  However,  most  microresonator  sensors  rely  on  the  measurement  of 
transmission  or  scattering  characteristics  of  a  microresonator  exited  by  an 
optical  waveguide  mode  in  the  presence  of  biological  material  on  the 
resonator surface or in the surrounding solution. These sensors can detect the 
resonance  frequency  shift  caused  by  the  change  of  the  resonator  effective 
refractive  index  or  increased  absorption  (Boyd,  2001;  Krioukov,  2002; 
Vollmer,  2003;  Chao,  2003).  Alternatively,  the  sensors  can  measure  the 
change in phase and/or intensity of the light at the output of the waveguide 
in the forward direction at a fixed wavelength (Rosenblit, 2004). 

High  Q-factors  of  microresonator  modes  are  crucial  for  achieving  high 
sensitivity  of  the  sensors.  Indeed,  the  higher  the  Q-factor,  the  steeper  the 
slope  between  zero  and  unity  in  the  transmission  characteristic  of  a 
microresonator,  resulting  in  higher  sensor  sensitivity.  Another  way  to 
enhance  the  slope  between  the  zero  and  the  unity  transmission  (and  thus 
improve  the  sensor  sensitivity)  is  to  use  a  microresonator  structure  that 
generates a sharp asymmetric Fano-resonance line shape (Chao, 2003). 

5.4 

Spontaneous emission control, novel light sources 
and cavity QED 

Another  major  application  for  microresonators  is  in  development  and 
fabrication  of  novel  light  sources  such  as  resonant-cavity-enhanced  light-
emitting  diodes  (LEDs),  low-threshold  microlasers,  and  colour  flat-panel 
displays.  In  wavelength-sized  microresonator  structures,  semiconductor 
material  luminescence  can  be  either  suppressed  or  enhanced,  and  they  also 
enable  narrowing  of  the  spectral  linewidth  of  the  emitted  light  (Haroche, 
1989; Yokoyama, 1992; Yamamoto, 1993; Krauss, 1999; Vahala, 2003).

low-loss  wavelength-scale 

Since  1946,  when  it  was  first  proposed  that  the  spontaneous  emission 
from an excited state of an emitter can be significantly altered if it is placed 
into 
various 
microresonator  designs  for  efficient  control  of  spontaneous  emission  have 
been explored including microdisk (Levi, 1993; Baba, 1997, 1999; Backes, 
1999; Cao, 2000; Fujita, 1999, 2001, 2002; Zhang, 1996), microsphere (Cai, 
2000;  Shopova,  2004;  Rakovich,  2003)  and  micropost  (Pelton,  2002; 
Reithmaier,  2004;  Santori,  2004;  Solomon,  2001;  Gayral,  1998)  resonators 
as  well  as  PC  defect  cavities  (Painter,  1999;  Boroditsky,  1999;  Gayral, 
1999).  Depending  on  the  Q-factors  (resonance  linewidths)  of  the  modes 
supported by the microresonator in the spontaneous emission range of the 
resonator material, the two situations illustrated in Fig. 7 can be realized. In 
a cavity-enhanced LED (Fig. 7a), the material gain bandwidth is smaller than 
the  cavity  resonance  bandwidth,  and  emission  of  the  whole  material  gain 
spectrum  is  enhanced.  In  a  semiconductor  laser  (Fig.  7b)  with  a  laser 
microcavity supporting high-Q modes, the emission at one (or several) of the 
modal  wavelengths  is  strongly  enhanced  (being  predominantly  stimulated 
emission),  while  the  emission  at  all  other  wavelengths  is  suppressed.  The 
amount  by  which  the  spontaneous  emission  rate  is  enhanced  for  an  emitter 
on  resonance  with  a  cavity  mode  is  characterized  by  the  Purcell  factor, 

56 
 
which is proportional to the mode Q-factor and inversely proportional to the 
mode volume. 

Trevor M. Benson et al. 

Clearly, to increase the enhancement factor, it is necessary to design and 
fabricate high-Q, small-V microresonators. However, cavity-enhanced LEDs 
based on the microresonators with high-Q modes must have equally narrow 
material  spontaneous  emission  linewidths  (Fig.  7a),  which  are  not  easily 
realized  in  bulk  or  heterostructure  quantum-well  microresonators.  The 
recently  proposed  concept  of  an  active  material  system,  semiconductor 
quantum  dots  (QDs)  (Arakawa,  2002)  combines  the  narrow  linewidth 
normally  associated  with  atomic  emitters  and  the  high  gain  achievable  in 
semiconductors.  The  QD  emission  spectrum  exhibits  delta-function-like 
lines with ultra-narrow linewidths (Fig. 7c). QDs of various sizes can now be 
fabricated by self-assembly, and have been integrated as emitters (so-called 
artificial  atoms)  in  microdisk  (Cao,  2000),  PC  defect  (Yoshie,  2001; 
Hennesy,  2003),  micropost/micropillar  (Santori,  2004;  Solomon,  2001; 
Gayral,  1998;  Benyoucef,  2004),  and  microsphere  (Shopova,  2004; 
Rakovich,  2003)  resonators.  The  challenge  is  then  to  carefully  design  and 
tune the microresonator modal and geometrical properties to manipulate and 
increase the strength of coupling between the QD and an optical field of the 
resonator mode (Pelton, 2002; Hennesy, 2003).

In  the  microcavity  lasers,  only  a  small  portion  of  the  spontaneous 
emission couples into a single (or several) optical modes (Fig. 7b). It should 
also be noted that optical modes of rotationally symmetrical microresonators 
are  either  multiple  (microspheres)  or  double  (microdisks,  microrings, 
circular micropillars, etc.) degenerate. This often leads to the appearance of 

57

closely  located  doublets  in  their  lasing  spectra  due  to  fabrication  errors 
(sidewall roughness  and  shape imperfections,  etc.) and thus causes spectral 
noise,  mode  hopping  and  polarization  instabilities  (Gayral,  1998;  Fujita, 
1999;  Boriskina,  2004).  Among  recently  proposed  modified  resonator 
designs  that  remove  the  mode  degeneracy  and  help  separate  two  closely

square  (Guo,  2003;  Boriskina,  2005),  microgear  (Fujita,  2001,  2002;

(Backes,  1998;  Boriskina,  2005) 
microresonators.

If,  as  a  result  of  optical  or  electrical  pumping,  the  optical  gain  in  the 
resonator  active  material  begins  to  dominate  optical  loss,  stimulated 
emission in the microresonator begins to dominate spontaneous emission. To 
improve  the  microlaser  efficiency,  it  is  desirable  to  reduce  the  threshold 
input energy at which lasing (stimulated emission) begins to occur. The laser 
threshold  depends  on  the  size  of  a  laser  microresonator,  the  lasing  mode 
optical  confinement,  the  gain/absorption  balance  of  the  resonator  material 
and the presence of several competing modes within a material spontaneous 
emission range. Reducing the number of available modes in the spontaneous 
emission  range  would  therefore  both  reduce  the  threshold  and  improve  the 
laser  noise  characteristics.  This  can  be  achieved  by  either  detuning  the 
wavelengths of all the modes but one against the spontaneous emission peak, 
or  decreasing  their  Q-factors  and  thus  reducing  spontaneous  emission  into 
these  modes.  For  example,  all  the  higher-radial-order  WG  modes  in 
microdisk  resonators,  with  the  fields  occupying  large  areas  inside  the  disk, 
can be suppressed by removing material from the resonator interior (Fig. 8a) 
by piercing holes (Backes, 1999) or forming microring resonators (Hagness, 

Trevor M. Benson et al. 

58 
 
1997; Boriskina, 1999, 2002). Enhancement of the working mode Q factor in 
a microgear (circular microdisk with a periodically corrugated rim) laser has 
also  been  achieved  (Fujita,  2002),  together  with  the  suppression  of  the  Q 
factor of the other mode of a doublet appearing due to splitting of a double-
degenerate first-radial-order WG mode of a circular microdisk (Fujita, 2001; 
Boriskina,  2004;  Fig.  8b).  Another  way  to  reduce  the  threshold  in  a 
microcavity laser is to increase the fraction of spontaneous emission into the 
lasing mode by improving the spectral alignment between the material gain 
peak and the microcavity mode wavelength (Fujita, 2001; Cao, 2003).  

Finally,  most  practical  optoelectronic  applications  require  light  sources 
with  a  directional  light  output,  e.g.,  for  efficient  coupling  into  the  narrow 
acceptance  cone  of  an  optical  fibre.  In  the  micropost  and  micropillar 
resonators,  emission  occurs  in  a  single-lobe  pattern  (Gayral,  1998;  Pelton, 
2002),  which  makes  their  coupling  to  fibres  relatively  straightforward. 
However, due to a rotational symmetry of the structure, the emission patterns 
of  the  WG  modes  in  microspheres  or  circular  microdisks  are  not 
unidirectional.  Instead,  they  have  as  many  identical  beams  as  twice  the 
azimuthal  index  of  the  WG  mode.  One  of  the  ways to  directionally  extract 
the  light  from  such  microresonators  is  to  use  output  couplers,  e.g., 
evanescent-field couplers of various configurations described in Section 5.1. 
Alternatively,  microresonators  with  non-circularly-symmetric  geometrical 
shapes  can  be  designed  to  obtain  directional  emission  patterns.  Directional 
light  output  has  been  observed  from  deformed  spherical  resonators; 
quadrupolar,  elliptical  (Noeckel,  1994;  Gmachl,  1998;  Backes,  1999;  Lee, 
2002; Boriskina, 2002; Kim, 2004; Fig. 9a), and egg-shaped (Shima, 2001; 
Boriskina,  2002)  microdisks;  microdisks  with  patterned  gratings  and  tabs 
(Levi,  1992);  micropost  and  disk  resonators  with  spiral  cross-sections 
(Chern,  2003;  Kneissl,  2004);  and  microdisks  with  notches  and  openings 
(Chu, 1994; Backes, 1999; Boriskina, 2006; Fig. 9b).

SIMULATION METHODS 

All  the  above-discussed  technological  advancements  in  microresonator 
fabrication  and  functional  applications  call  for  innovative  computational 
methods for solving Maxwell’s equations, which govern the electromagnetic 
fields  in  the  resonator  structures.  Development  of  rigorous  yet  efficient 
simulation methods and CAD tools is necessary to fully exploit the potential 
of the new generation of microresonators, substantially reducing the cost and 
time  of  the  design  stage,  to  create  novel  devices,  and  to  study  new  optical 
phenomena in microcavities. 

Micro-optical Resonators 
 

59

Unfortunately, Maxwell’s equations can be solved analytically for only a 
few  simple  canonical  resonator  structures,  such  as  spheres  (Stratton,  1997) 
and  infinitely  long  cylinders  of  circular  cross-sections  (Jones,  1964).  For 
arbitrary-shape  microresonators,  numerical  solution  is  required,  even  in  the 
2-D  formulation.  Most  2-D  methods  and  algorithms  for  the  simulation  of 
microresonator properties rely on the Effective Index (EI) method to account 
for  the  planar  microresonator  finite  thickness  (Chin,  1994).  The EI  method 
enables  reducing  the  original  3-D  problem  to  a  pair  of  2-D  problems  for 
transverse-electric  and  transverse-magnetic  polarized  modes  and  perform 
numerical  calculations  in  the  plane  of  the  resonator.  Here,  the  effective 
refractive index of the 2-D structure is taken as the normalized propagation 
constant of the fundamental guided mode in an equivalent planar waveguide 
with the same thickness and material as the microresonator. 

The finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method (Chu, 1989) has been 
a main workhorse in modelling and design of optical microresonators (both 
in  2-D  and  3-D)  over  the  past  few  decades,  due  to  its  simplicity  and 
flexibility (Fujita, 2001; Fong, 2003, 2004; Ryu, 2004; Painter, 2001; Pelton, 
2002;  Hagness,  1997;  Vuckovic,  1999;  Rosenblit,  2004).  However,  the 
FDTD  method  suffers  from  relatively  large  dispersive  error,  staircasing 
errors at resonator boundaries, and reduction of accuracy to the first order at 
material  interfaces.  Furthermore,  optical  microresonators  are  often  placed 
into  complex  open  space  domains,  in  which  case  discretization  of  the 
problem can lead to errors caused by non-physical backreflections from the 
edges  of  the  computational  window.  For  large  and  complex  domains,  and 
especially in full-vectorial 3-D simulations, development of faster algorithms 
becomes  imperative  to  reduce  the  cost  of  computations,  as  the  grid  size 
required  by  using  the  FDTD  method  becomes  prohibitively  expensive  for 
even  modern  advanced  computers.  For  example,  CPU  times  for  the  FDTD 
computations  of  the  characteristics  of  a  2.25  µm-diameter  semiconductor 
microring  resonator  evanescently  coupled  to  a  straight  semiconductor 
waveguide reached 35 hours on a 1-GHz, 4-GB RAM platform (Fujii, 2003). 
By  using  fast  algorithms  based  on  approximate  techniques  such  as 
geometrical  optics,  “billiard  theory”,  paraxial  approximation,  etc.  useful 
insight  into the ray dynamics within  optically  large  microresonators  can be 
obtained (Chowdhury, 1992; Noeckel, 1994, 2000; Jiang, 1999; Poon, 2001; 
Guo  2003;  Huang  2001;  Fong,  2004).  However,  the  accuracy  of  such 
methods  is  clearly  not  adequate  for  studying  the  modal  spectra  of 
microresonators whose dimensions are of the order of an optical wavelength. 
Among  other  popular  first-order  numerical  tools  for  the  microresonator 
design  are:  algorithms  based  on  the  Coupled  Mode  Theory  (Yariv,  1973; 
Little, 1997; Manolatou, 1999; Chin, 1998, Hammer, 2002), which are able 
to  provide  fast  initial  designs  of  waveguide-coupled  circular  and  square 

60 
 
microdisk resonators; and the Spectral Index method (Greedy, 2000), which 
has been successfully applied to study the WG mode characteristics of high-
index-contrast circular microdisk resonators mounted on substrates (Fig. 10).

Accurate yet computationally efficient techniques that have been already 
demonstrated to yield solutions to a variety of design problems in optics and 
photonics  are  based  on  the  formulation  of  the  problem  in  terms  of  either 
volume  or  surface  integral  equations  (IEs).  A  clear  advantage  of  such 
formulations is that the problem size is reduced by moving it from the open 
infinite domain to a finite one (a volume or a surface of the microresonator), 
which  reduces  the  required  computational  effort.  Furthermore,  the  use 
of artificial  absorbing  conditions  is  completely  avoided,  together  with  the 
danger  of  unwanted  non-physical  back-reflections,  and  microresonators 
located  in  the  layered  media  can  be  modelled  without  loss  of  accuracy 
(Boriskina,  1999,  2002,  2003;  Chremmos,  2004).  The  IE  formulation  of 
Maxwell’s  equations, in  its continuous form,  is exact provided that the full 
equivalence  takes  place.  By  using  various  Galerkin-type  discretization 
schemes  with  low-  and  high-order  basis  functions  (Harrington,  1968), 
numerical  algorithms  with  various  convergence  rates  (and  thus  various 
computational  costs  to  reach  a  desired  accuracy)  can  be  constructed,  with 
higher-order schemes providing the most computationally efficient solutions 
(Atkinson, 1997; Nosich, 1999). Due to the flexibility of the method, it has 
been successfully applied to study modal characteristics of symmetrical and 
asymmetrical  microresonator  structures  in  2-D,  such  as  circular,  elliptical, 
hexagonal, stadium, and notched microdisk resonators (Wiersig, 2003; Lee, 
2004; Boriskina, 1999-2005; Kottmann, 2000, Chremmos, 2004). In 3-D, IE 
techniques  have  been  developed  mainly  to  analyse  dielectric  resonators  of 
electrically small size typical for microwave applications (Kucharski, 2000; 
Glisson, 1983; Umashankar, 1986; Liu, 2004).

It should be noted, however, that the Q factors of open microcavities do 
not  characterise  directly  the  threshold  gain  values  of  the  corresponding 
semiconductor  lasers.  To  overcome  this  difficulty  a  new  lasing  eigenvalue 
problem (LEP) was introduced recently (Smotrova, 2004). The LEP enables 
one to quantify  accurately the  lasing  frequencies,  thresholds,  and  near- and 
far-field  patterns  separately  for  various  WG  modes  in  semiconductor  laser 
resonators.  However,  the  threshold  of  a  lasing  mode  depends  on  other 
factors,  including  presence  of  several  competing  modes  within  a  material 
spontaneous  emission  range  and  detuning  of  the  lasing  wavelength  against 
the spontaneous emission peak. To account for these effects, a spontaneous 
emission coupling factor (β factor) of a given mode can be calculated, which 
is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  spontaneous  emission  rate  into  that  mode  and 
the  spontaneous  emission  rate  into  all  modes  (Bjork,  1991).  Various 
approaches  to  calculate  the  β  factor  have  been  described  in  the  literature, 
including  classical  and  quantum  mechanical  methods  as  well  as  FDTD 
(Bjork, 1991; Chin, 1994; Vuckovic, 1999; Xu, 2000).

CONCLUSIONS 

Recent  advances  in  the  nanofabrication  technology  offer  the  possibility  of 
manufacturing  novel  optical  microresonator  devices  with  unprecedented 
control in a variety of natural and artificial material systems. High-Q micro- 
and nano-scale resonators have already proven to be excellent candidates for 
optical  signal  processing  in  low-cost  high-density  photonic  integrated 
circuits,  significant  enhancement  of  detection  sensitivity  in  biosensors,  and 
compact and  efficient  laser sources with  enhanced functionality. Continued 
development  of  new  materials  with  specially  designed  properties  such  as 
quantum  wires  and  dots  as  well  as  3-D  photonic  crystal  structures  is 
expected  to  yield  more  ideal  high-performance  optical  resonators.  These 
novel  resonator  designs  will  fuel  future  growth  of  broadband  all-optical 
networks  and  will  impact  basic  research  in  quantum  physics  and  quantum 
information  science.  However,  emerging  resonator-based  devices  and 
applications  as  well  as  growing  industrial  competition  impose  strict 
requirements  on  the  accuracy  and  performance  of  the  existing  resonator 
design  and  simulation  tools  calling  for  the  development  of  advanced 
methods and algorithms.

Abstract 
 
This paper reviews the Oppenheimer, Volkoff and Snyder’s arguments about the 
formation of black holes from the collapse of Neutron Stars. It is found that such a 
collapse is inconsistent with microscopic causality and Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

Introduction 
 
It  has  been  suggested  by  Oppenheimer,  Volkoff  [1]  and  Snyder  [2]  that  after  the 
thermonuclear  sources  of  energy  are  exhausted,  a  sufficient  heavy  star  will  collapse. 
Tolman’s  gravitational  solutions  [3],  and  the  Fermi  state  equation  for  a  gas  of  cold 
neutrons  [4]  are  the  mathematical  framework  for  this  claim.  This  paper  recreates  these 
calculations  and  finds  that  microscopic  causality  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  is 
inconsistent  with  a  gravitational  collapse.  It  is  proposed  that  an  alternate  interpretation 
may  exist  different  to  the  creation  of  a  black  hole.  Section  1  is  devoted  to  recreate 
Einstein’s  Field  Equation  for  a  perfected  spherical  fluid,  section  2  recreates  the  Fermi 
State Equation, section 3 recreates equations for a gravitational collapse of a neutron star, 
and section 4 is devoted to present a new alternative to that of Black Hole formation.

2.  Fermi State Equation for a Degenerate Gas of Cold Neutrons

This Fermi’s state equation, ρ(P), is constrained by microscopic causality. According to 
microscopic  causality,  local  densities  D(x)  of  observable  operators  do  not  interfere  and 
therefore commute for space-like separations [5] 
 
[
 
Microscopic  causality  is  sizeable  only  for  distances  comparable  to  the  Compton 
wavelength of the particle. Since the information can not propagate faster than the speed 
of light. That is,

 for a neutron. Therefore a relativistic neutron gas must satisfy this constraint. 
The  Fermi  state  equation  can  not  be  valid  for  neutrons  separated  by  a  distance  shorter 
than their Compton wavelength. Beyond this distance a new change phase must occur to 
a  collapsing  neutron  star.  This  alternative  to  black  hole  formation  is  suggested  in  this 
manuscript.

reaching the following conclusion: “either the equation of state we have used so far fails 
to describe the behavior of highly condensed matter that the conclusions are qualitative 
misleading1 or the star will continue to contract indefinitely, never reaching equilibrium.” 
They disregard the first option [2] and conclude that a gravitational collapse occurs or a 
black hole formation.

4.  An Alternative to Black Holes Formation 

 
Because equations (17) and (18) are constrained by microscopic causality a gravitational 
collapse is not permissible. That is, the neutrons in the relativistic Fermi gas must be 
separated by a distance greater than their Compton wavelength. 
An alternative to a gravitational collapse is the neutron-antineutron  pair formation. The 
uncertainty principle for a relativistic point particle [6] is given by

Therefore  when  one  tries  to  assign  coordinates  (the  center  of  the  star  R=0)  to  a  falling 
particle (neutron) in a collapsing star one needs to provide  this particle a momentum of 
the same order than its rest mass, thus allowing the creation of a new particle [7]. Also if 
one tried to find out the behavior of two neutrons, of the relativistic Fermi gas, separated 
by  a  distance  equal  to  its  Compton  wavelength,  one  needs  to  provide  to  one  of  the 
neutrons  a  energy  on  the  order  of  mc2,  allowing  again  the  creation  of  particles.  This

simple second argument shows that in a relativistic quantum mechanics, the coordinates 
of a particle can not appear as dynamic variables.  
According  to  the  arguments  above  the  final  fate  of  a  neutron  star  is  the  neutron-
antineutron  pair  creation  and  posterior  disintegration.  That  is,  starburst  of  pions  and 
gamma  rays  must  be  emitted  by  a  “collapsing”  neutron  star.  Some  possible  modes  of 
disintegration could be

Conclusion 
 
This  paper  suggests  a  new  interpretation  of  the  final  fate  of  a  neutron  star.  Although  a 
more clear description must rest on a quantum theory of gravity.

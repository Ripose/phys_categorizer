Abstract:  A new, very different physical model of the universe is proposed.  Its virtues
include unifying relativity and quantum mechanics, and particles with de Broglie waves.
It also appears to provide a truly unified physical basis for electromagnetic, gravitational and
nuclear forces.  The basic system is a four-dimensional Euclidean space, containing an array

of  nonlinear  "flow"  waves.    These  repeat  in  one  dimension,  called 
mechanics, time is treated as an additional, unidirectional parameter describing the evolution
of the system.  Nevertheless, this wave system is shown be inherently relativistic.  Further
 these
self-organizing patterns arise within the overall wave structure.  Called "wavicles,

have intrinsic quantized fields, "spin,
 and rest energy, and represent elementary particles.
#
Relativistic expressions are derived for particle behavior in scalar, vector and gravitational
potentials.    Proper  representations  of  these  potentials,  based  on  the  wave  fields  and
 flows of wavicles, are also obtained.  As in the causal quantum mechanics of de
associated 
Broglie and Bohm, wavicles exist continuously and follow definite, stochastic trajectories.
Although experimentally equivalent to Einstein's special relativity, this theory differs fundamentally
from his general relativity and the associated Big Bang model.  According to Linde, the latter
predict  a  large-scale  space-time  curvature  roughly  60  orders  of  magnitude  greater  than
observed  values.    Here  a  flat  large-scale  geometry  is  predicted,  in  agreement  with  the
observed distribution of galaxies.  This theory is also consistent with recent observations
pertaining to the age of the universe.

1. Introduction

...a good theoretical physicist today might find it useful to have a wide range
of physical viewpoints and mathematical expressions of the same theory (for
example of quantum electrodynamics) available to him  . . .  If [everyone]
follows  the  same  current  fashion  in  expressing  and  thinking  about
electrodynamics  or  field  theory,  then  the  variety  of  hypotheses  being
generated  . . .  is limited.  Perhaps rightly so, for possibly the chance is high
that the truth lies in the fashionable direction.  But, on the off chance that it
is in another direction -- a direction obvious from an unfashionable view of
field theory -- who will find it?  Only someone who has sacrificed himself by
teaching himself quantum electrodynamics from a peculiar and unusual point
of view, one he may have to invent for himself.

What are the constituents of matter?  Although they are equally particle and wave-like, we
call them particles.  Early in the development of quantum mechanics, Erwin Schrödinger
expressed  the  view  that  it  should  be  possible  to  explain  particles  on  the  basis  of  wave
phenomena, and thereby provide a unified representation of both particle aspects.  However,
Schrödinger was unable to do so, and while there have been other notable efforts, by de
 
Broglie ,  Bohm ,  and  Vigier ,  for  example,  or  Pering  and  Skyrme ,  none  have  found
widespread acceptance.

In widely accepted theories, such as quantum chromodynamics, the complexity and richness
of particles and their interactions are attributed to their particle-like aspect.  The associated
matter waves are assumed to be relatively featureless and play no more than the simple
probabilistic role first articulated by Born in the mid-nineteen twenties.  Explored here is a
new  theory,  related  to  that  of  de  Broglie,  Bohm  and  Vigier,  where  waves  play  a  much
broader role.  Besides a unified picture of matter waves and particles, it appears to offer a
unified  description  of  relativity,  quantum  mechanics,  electrodynamics,  gravitation,  and
nuclear forces as well.

Unlike the waves of standard quantum mechanics, the waves in this theory are nonlinear.
Involved  is  a  nonlinear  effect,  common  in  nature,  whose  importance  is  not  widely
appreciated.  The waves are also highly organized, in what is sometimes called a coherent
structure.  Within this overall structure, additional self-organizing wave patterns arise: these
correspond to both particles and their fields.  Before taking up the new theory, I'd like to
begin  with  a  qualitative  look  at  various  known  nonlinear  wave  phenomena  and  some
coherent structures.

Nonlinear Waves

Stanislaw Ulam remarked once that using the term "nonlinear science" is like calling zoology
"the study of non-elephant animals.
  Real
  The same could be said of "nonlinear waves.
#
#
waves of every kind have at least some small degree of nonlinearity.  Even electromagnetic
waves, often cited in textbooks as examples of perfect linearness, are not.  (Nonlinearity in
electromagnetic waves can give rise to electron-positron pairs, for example.)  So I'd like to
 we are really talking about
begin by asserting that, when we speak of "nonlinear waves,
#
waves in general.

Fig. 1-1.  Shock front development in an acoustic wave.  (From Towne .)5

A basic attribute of nonlinear waves, essential to the present theory, is feedback.  A simple
example can be seen in acoustic shock waves.  In these, the propagation velocity depends
markedly on wave amplitude -- the larger the amplitude, the greater the velocity.  Fig. 1-1
depicts  the  development  of  a  shock  front.    (Here  the  wave  is  propagating  in  just  one
dimension.)  As the faster-moving peak overtakes the front of the wave, the more it grows.
And the more it grows, the faster it overtakes the front, steepening the wavefront.  So here
there is positive feedback.

Ripples in wind-blown sand are a good example of negative feedback.  This gives the ripples
in a given region similar heights and spacings.  (One obvious factor is that the wind blows
the  exposed  tops  off  of  taller  ripples.)    Sand  ripples  also  have  a  capacity  to  counteract
disturbances.  If you rub out some of the ripples in an area, with a steady wind, the pattern
will "heal" itself.  Feedback is, of course, an essential element in many self-organizing natural
systems, the most remarkable being life.  While sand ripples exhibit only simple behaviors,
there are other wave systems which may seem almost alive.

Such waves are found in the plasmas of fusion machines.  These highly nonlinear waves, or
"instabilities,
 have a remarkably powerful and adaptable capacity for self-organization.  The
#
plasmas are contained in magnetic "wells" with energy depths far greater than the overall
plasma  energies.    However,  the  instabilities  have  high  localized  energy  concentrations,
which have invariably allowed them and their plasmas to escape the best designed wells.

4

Like insects evolving to defeat pesticides, as wells have been redesigned to defeat known
instabilities, new types have always arisen to take their places.

What causes nonlinearity in waves?  The obvious answer is: nonlinearity in the wave media.
However, even with a perfectly linear medium (if there were such) nonlinearity can still
arise.  Nonlinearity in waves has a second cause, equally as important as the characteristics
of the medium: the waves themselves.  This aspect of wave behavior receives little attention
in  most  university  physics  curricula.    In  elementary  texts,  the  mechanism  behind  this
nonlinearity is usually denied:

If you have ever watched ocean waves moving toward shore, you may have
wondered if the waves were carrying water into the beach.  This is, in fact,
not  the  case.    Water  waves  move  with  a  recognizable  velocity.    But  each
particle of water itself merely oscillates about an equilibrium point . . .   This
is a general feature of waves: waves can move over large distances, but the
medium itself has only limited movement . . .   A wave consists of oscillations
that move without carrying matter with them.

-Douglas C. Giancoli
Physics, 3rd Ed., 1991

Waves  transport  energy,  but  not  matter,  from  one  region  to  another.  [Original
italics.]

-Hugh D. Young
University Physics, 8th Ed., 1992

...here we see an essential feature of what is called wave motion.  A condition
of some kind is transmitted from one place to another by means of a medium,
but the medium itself is not transported.

(The first two texts are used at my university.)  By the time they reach graduate school, most
continuing physics students probably learn that this picture of waves is wrong.  However,
although  it  becomes  apparent  in  more  advanced  texts,  the  error  of  this  wave  picture  is
seldom pointed out explicitly.*  Real waves can transport their media.  And waves which do

*It’s been argued that there's nothing wrong with this teaching method.  An example cited
is  the  teaching  of  mechanics,  which  begins  with  the  inaccurate  Newtonian  system,
superseded later by relativity.  There is a difference, though.  When relativity is introduced,
it’s pointed out, repeatedly, that the Newtonian picture is incorrect.

are inherently nonlinear, regardless of the medium they occur in.  As we'll see, such waves
are actually commonplace in the real world and play a central role in the present theory.

We'll call waves which move their media from place to place "flow waves.
  Water solitons
#
are a clear example.  The amplitude of an individual "shallow water" soliton propagating in
the x direction is given approximately by

 is the soliton's
where u is the water surface elevation in relation to the undisturbed surface, 
velocity, and t is time.    This equation indicates that water solitons can hold their shape over
time.  For a given t, it describes a symmetrical, raised hump of water, declining to the same
level on both sides of the peak, as illustrated in Fig. 1-2.  At the time depicted, most of this
soliton is in region A.  Compared to an adjacent region, B, of equal length, A holds more
water.  It's apparent that, as the soliton enters B, a water volume equaling that of the hump
must flow from region A into B.  Outside the soliton, the water is motionless.  So, as the
soliton proceeds further, this displaced water never flows back.  

(cid:19)

Fig. 1-2.  Water soliton.

Naturally occurring solitons can be seen in the ocean photo of Fig. 1-5.  Unlike the isolated
soliton just described, this regular array carries an intermittent, but continuing flow of water.
While these apparently were created by a storm, ocean solitons can also be caused by tides.
Oceanographers refer to the overall movement of water brought about by waves as "mass
transport."7

Solitons are by no means the only flow waves occurring in water.  Ordinary "dispersing"
waves can move water from place to place also.  In fact, this is generally the case for the
waves created by wind.  Contrary to the first text cited, ordinary ocean waves do bring water
to  the  shore.    With  large  waves,  the  effects  can  be  dramatic:  for  example,  waves  are
responsible, to a significant degree, for bringing the high tides associated with storms.  

Rip currents are another effect of ocean flow waves.  What happens is this: as waves bring
water to the beach and then dissipate, the water level there is raised.  The raised level then
drives a return flow back out to sea.  When the incoming waves are small, the return flow

6

usually takes the form of an undertow.  However, when the waves are larger, the water
draining from the beach often becomes organized into rip currents.7

There  are many other examples of natural flow waves besides those created by tides or
winds.  What happens when you toss a rock into a pond?  Of course the rock displaces water;
most of that displacement is borne off by waves.  On a larger scale, tsunamis are flow waves
generated by the vertical displacement of the sea floor.  When you speak or sing, the sound
waves carry away a flow of air.  Flow waves also arise in solids.  For example, seismic waves
propagate lasting displacements in the earth's crust.  While they've received scarce attention,
waves that transport their media are more the rule in nature than the exception.

Where the present theory is concerned, an important feature of flow waves is that, even in
a "linear" medium, they do not superpose like linear waves.  When interacting, in addition
to  displacing  each  other,  flow  waves  can  also  refract  and  reflect  one  another.    We'll  be
looking at these phenomena later.  Except for computer simulation, it is difficult to describe
the interactions of flow waves accurately in more than one dimension.  However, we'll infer
some of their gross behaviors from the interactions of steady flows and waves.  (Here we'll
be working with acoustic waves.  For water waves, an excellent reference on wave/flow
interactions is a review by Peregrine .)  

7

In addition to its presence in many nonlinear wave phenomena, flow is also found at the
heart of a great many chaotic systems.  Some well-known examples are Edward Lorenz's air
convection model, or the Lorenzian waterwheel (also known as the "turbulent fountain"),
dripping  water  faucets,  Taylor  vortices,  meandering  rivers,  the  Brusselator  (a  chemical
reactor with flowing reactants), piling streams of sand, stirred paint, and Jupiter's Great Red
Spot. 

Wraparound Trapping

In 1965, Zabusky and Kruskal  published a ground-breaking report on computer simulations
of waves in a nonlinear medium.  Their paper marked the first use of the word "soliton.
*
#
The wave system studied was a very simple, one-dimensional one, governed by the

*Although Zabusky and Kruskal were unaware when they introduced the term, solitons
were discovered in 1834 by the Scottish scientist and engineer John Scott-Russell.  Scott-
Russell first observed solitons while studying the waves made by canal barges and later
reproduced them in extensive wave tank experiments.  Emphasizing the transport, or flow,
of the wave medium, his term for the phenomenon was "wave of translation".  (Borrowing
from Russell, maybe a better term for flow waves would be "translation waves".)

This describes the behavior of waves in a dispersive medium, where wave velocity varies
both with wavelength and amplitude.  The equation pertains (although not precisely) to
certain waves in water, plasmas and a variety of other media.  (Eq. (1-1) for the amplitude
of a water soliton is obtained as a solution of this one.)

This wave system was investigated further by Tappert .  Like Zabusky and Kruskal, he made
a computer-generated "movie" depicting soliton formation.  A frame of Tappert's movie,
taken from a review by Scott, Chu, and McLaughlin  appears in Fig. 1-4.  Besides the waves
themselves, his movie also shows the energy of each harmonic mode, indicated by its wave
number, k.  Scott et. al. discuss the figure as follows:

Observe  that  for  the  case  of  soliton  formation,  the  mode  energies  fall
exponentially with increasing wave number, and consider Planck's formula
for the average energy of  a mode with quantized energy levels:

where k  is Boltzmann's constant, T is absolute temperature, and h is Planck's
constant.  The condition for the equipartition of energy is displayed in [1-3b].
The  exponential  decrease  of  average  mode  energy  with  increasing  mode
frequency in [1-3c], on the other hand, is qualitatively similar to the effect
which forced Planck to assume quantized energy levels.  It is intriguing that
[Fig. 1-4] displays such an effect without the quantum assumption. [Original
italics.]

In  addition  to  its  seemingly  quantum  mechanical  aspect,  the  wave  system  of  Zabusky,
Kruskal and Tappert is of interest here for another reason: it’s related to a multidimensional
wave system at the center of the present theory.  Both systems are nonlinear and repetitive
in  one  dimension.    In  systems  of  this  kind,  an  elementary  effect,  which  we'll  call
"wraparound trapping,
 occurs.  Referring to Fig. 1-3, if space is divided into regions equal
#
to the period of the initial waveform, you can see that the waves in each region are effectively
trapped there.  Because of the repetitive nature of the system, every time a wave or wave
component exits the right side of a region, an identical wave enters from the left, and vice
versa.  It's as though each region wraps around on itself.  So, the periodicity of such systems
is conserved.

Coherent Structures

There isn't a standard definition for the term "coherent structure.
  Most often, it is used in
#
connection with the study of turbulence, where it generally refers to an underlying spatial
regularity in the vorticity of turbulent systems.  However, it has also been used by nonlinear
wave researchers, as a catchall term for any sort of organized nonlinear wave system.  In this
paper,  we'll  use  a  definition  which  straddles  these  areas.    Here,  we  define  a  coherent
structure as: a self-organized, regular arrangement of waves and/or vorticity.  (We don't
require strict periodicity.  For example, quasicrystalline wave structures exhibit regularity
without being periodic .)11

A good example of a wave-based coherent structure is the highly regular array of ocean
solitons in Fig. 1-5.  Rip current patterns are another type of coherent structure.  Off long,
straight beaches, where the ocean bottom is uniform, rip currents are observed to have fairly
regular spacings.  Involved are water circulation patterns resembling convection cells.  An
intriguing aspect of these systems is that the incoming flow waves appear to be diverted by
the outgoing rip currents from those regions .7

Another, very interesting, coherent structure can be seen in Fig. 1-6.  The photograph shows
a regular arrangement of cusps which develop in artificial waves created in a wave tank .12
While it normally refers to the vertical dimension of water waves, here we'll use the term
"transverse" to indicate the transverse horizontal dimension.  In the area of the tank where
these waves are generated, no transverse structure at all is seen; initially the wavefronts are
straight and smooth.  However, as the waves move across the tank, this cusped structure
develops.  Obviously, without the initial waves, there would be nowhere for cusps to form.
With respect to the wave components forming the cusps, the wave medium consists not of water
alone, but of waves as well.

The  wind-blown  sand  ripples  mentioned  above  are  a  coherent  structure  involving  both
waves  and vorticity.  In this phenomenon, vortex rolls in the air, caused by the Kelvin-
Helmholtz effect, shape the wind and sand.  (The rolls form between a moving wind layer
and a static boundary air layer at the sand surface.)  Concurrently, developing sand ripples
promote eddies in the airflow which reinforce the rolls and attract them to the ripples.  If the
wind doesn't shift, the resulting pattern can be strikingly regular.

An important aspect of coherent structures is that they are non-local phenomena, reflecting
the overall properties of the physical systems where they evolve.  It's apparent, for example,
that the shape and size of wind-blown sand ripples are a product of such factors as the
general coarseness of the sand, the density of the sand particles, the overall wind speed, etc.

11

12

It’s not always so apparent where the phase of a coherent structure comes from.  Starting
with a large flat area of sand and a steady wind, sand ripples are observed to form.  The
question arises: how do they decide where to form initially?  The answer must be that, while
it may be unobservable, at some finer level, there is always some pre-existing structure with
a predominant spatial phase.  (There is no such thing as a perfectly flat area of sand or a
perfectly steady wind.)  So the observed large-scale structure and its phase result from the
amplification of a lesser, sometimes unseen, structure.

13

A seemingly magical manifestation of this effect can be found in the high-speed photographs
  In the fourth frame, there are eight clearly defined depressions,
of a milk drop in Fig. 1-7.
having a radial symmetry and fairly regular spacings.  However, in the first frame, only an
instant before, absolutely nothing with an eightfold radial symmetry can be seen.  (You could
say there are "hidden" variables.)  The highly unstable nature of capillary waves (the type
involved here) guarantees that such depressions will form.  However, it is remarkable how,
in no apparent time, the system organizes itself and "decides" the angle at which the overall
pattern will be oriented.

This  finishes  the  informal  introduction  to  nonlinear  wave  phenomena  and  coherent
structures.  Where the present theory is concerned, some relevant points are these:

1. Flow is an essential element of many self-organizing, chaotic nonlinear
systems.

2. Commonly, waves transport their media, i.e., cause them to flow.

3. Flow waves are inherently nonlinear, regardless of the medium in which
they are found.

4. Flow waves can refract and reflect each other.

5. It's not unusual for nonlinear wave systems to organize themselves into
repetitive structures.

6. Repetitive wave structures may exhibit quantum mechanical behaviors.

13

2. A New Wave System

Now I'd like to introduce a new kind of nonlinear wave system.  However, first I need to
describe the geometric framework in which these waves exist, because it is not the usual
Minkowski space-time.  Sometimes divergent mathematical representations can be found for
the same phenomena.  For example, features on the surface of a sphere can be described by
either a 2-D non-Euclidean geometry or a 3-D Euclidean one.  Here we'll be using a higher-
order Euclidean alternative to the non-Euclidean geometry of Einstein and Minkowski.

Two of special relativity's founders, H. A. Lorentz and Henri Poincaré (who was responsible
for the term "relativity"), never accepted Einstein's space-time interpretation.  Both insisted,
to  the  end,  that  relativistic  phenomena  could  be  accounted  for  without  completely
abandoning classical time.  To make this possible, Lorentz proposed incorporating relativistic
contraction into the theory of matter.  However, it was objected that he did so on an ad hoc
basis. 

Lorentz's theory was also perceived to have a second drawback: It involved a "preferred"
frame  of  reference.    Einstein  made  the  compelling  argument  that  it  makes  no  sense  to
hypothesize a preferred frame if it can't be identified experimentally.  We will look at this
argument again later.  For now, though, I'd like to go ahead and describe a hypothetical
physical system which does involve a preferred reference frame, but in which relativistic (as
well as quantum mechanical) phenomena arise naturally, without ad hoc hypotheses.

The Geometric Framework

The framework for this theory is a 4-dimensional Euclidian space and classical time.  (So if
time is counted as a dimension, this system has five.)  We'll call the spatial dimensions x, y,
z and 
 (phi).  Within this framework there is a repeating system of waves, redundant along
1
 dimension.  Initially, we'll assume that the entire wave pattern repeats perfectly along
the 
 in a sinusoidal fashion, with a spatial period which we'll call the structure interval or s.
 we would see a uniform sinusoidal

(In other words, at any given x, y, z location, along 
variation in the wave amplitude with a spatial period s.)

 plane.  (In a more realistic case, the
Fig. 2-1 shows a simple wavefront pattern in the x,
waves would form interference patterns, without such distinct fronts.)  Dividing space into
parallel  regions  of  thickness  s  along  the 
  axis,  you  can  see  that  any  wave  or  wave
1
component exiting one side of a region is matched by an identical wave entering from the
opposite side.  As in the one-dimensional wave system of Zabusky, Kruskal and Tappert, the
waves in each periodic section are effectively trapped there by the wraparound effect, and
the  periodicity  of  the  overall  structure  is  conserved.    (So,  if  you  start  with  a  system  of
repeating waves with period s, and the waves don't dissipate, any wave patterns which
develop will always have this period.)

14

In  describing  this  4-D  wave  system,  we'll  make  frequent  use  of  a  3-D  "reference  space"
corresponding to the locus of points where 
 = 0,  shown as a horizontal line in Fig. 2-1.
1
(This is analogous to a reference plane in 3-D geometry.)  Because of its repetitive nature, the
entire 4-D wave system can be mapped into this 3-D space.  In the case of sinusoidal waves, this
can be done simply by specifying the sinusoidal amplitude and phase at each 3-D point
(x,y,z).  For example, the waveform on the right in Fig. 2-1 depicts the wave amplitude along
the vertical line, A, at point (x ,y ,z ).  The waveform can be mapped to this point in the
reference space by its overall sinusoidal amplitude, plus a phase value determined by the
waveform's positioning along 
 was chosen because it often represents
phase.)  Mapping this four-dimensional system into three will let us compare it with the
three-dimensional world we experience.

The Wave Medium

The wave medium in this theory is an elastic fluid; consequently, its waves are acoustic (i.e.
sound-like).  Except for its four-dimensional aspect, in many other respects it resembles an
ordinary fluid, such as air.  For example, a box of air is inhomogeneous and chaotic at the
scale of molecules, but relatively uniform at the macroscopic level.  Similarly, the properties
of this wave medium will be taken to vary at different scales.  In its scale-dependant nature,
this medium differs from the historical ether, which was generally considered "ideal.

* 
#

*In Greek mythology, the ether was something pure in the rarified atmosphere of Mount
Olympus, breathed by the gods.

15

There are several other differences:  In theories such as Lorentz's "Theory of the Electron,

the ether was assumed to be an elastic solid, to accommodate transverse electromagnetic
waves.  Of course it had one less spatial dimension.  Also, the ether was generally taken to

it unimpeded.  On the other hand, the wave medium in this theory is substantive.  Further,
elementary particles here are wave-based phenomena, where both they and their medium
are constituted of essentially the same stuff.  So I'd like to call this four-dimensional fluid
wave medium simply "stuff.
#

Like sound in air at a given temperature, the acoustic waves in stuff have a characteristic
velocity -- in this case, the speed of light, c.   Since such waves are essentially longitudinal,
of course they can't represent light per se, although they travel at more or less the same
speed.    (How  can  electromagnetic  waves  be  accounted  for  then?    As  we'll  see  later,  in
repetitive nonlinear wave structures, transverse secondary waves can arise.  These are waves
of interaction within the waves, or wave waves if you like!  Already we've partially glimpsed
such behavior in the cusped water waves of Fig. 1-6.)

In this "4-D Wave Theory,
 acoustic waves are responsible not only for particles, but also
#
their fields.  Before describing how, I need to introduce various basic features of the wave
system.  However, to introduce this system, it seems that something resembling particles is
needed.  So, initially, I'd like to make use of a very incomplete particle model proposed by
Schrödinger. 

Pro-particles and de Broglie Waves

In the early 1800's W. R. Hamilton developed a new formulation of mechanics based on a
close analogy between the behavior of material bodies and light.  His system was based on
hypothetical "surfaces of constant action,
 analogous to light wavefronts, whose normals
#
(rays) described the motions of material bodies.  Schrödinger was inspired by Hamilton's
optical-mechanical analogy in his development of wave mechanics, and felt that it might be
extended to further account for the elementary particles.  It was Schrödinger's contention that
particles might be nothing more than geometric normal rays associated with the continuous
wavefronts of matter waves .  In the present theory, elementary particles are not such simple
entities.  However, at this point it will be useful to assume Schrödinger's ray/particle model
and explore its implications in the context of  this wave system.  (Many features of this
simplified particle model will carry over.)

14

One of these Schrödinger "particles" can be seen as a point moving with a wave, along a
normal to the wavefront, keeping the same phase position on the wave.  (As though it were
somehow possible to mark a point on a wave itself, instead of marking the wave medium.)
The trajectory or velocity vector of this wave-point corresponds then to a ray.

Eq. (2-4) says that de Broglie waves have a phase velocity which is at least c, and is infinite
for motionless particles.  In the accepted picture, these phase velocities are considered the
true speeds of these waves, meaning that they are fundamentally different from ordinary
ones.  However, in this 4-D system, instead of infinite wave velocities, we simply have spatially
extended wavefronts.  Like water waves intersecting a beach, there is no limit to how fast a
phase point can move along, as different parts of a wavefront cross a line of reference.  We'll
see that, although four-dimensional, the waves in this theory are much more closely related
to familiar ones than those of present quantum mechanics.

3. Special Relativity

Although the physical system in this theory is properly relativistic, a preferred frame of
reference is involved.  So, this section begins with an overview of the preferred frame issue.

In solving relativity problems, one typically chooses some particular reference frame with
a given state of motion, to which events in other frames are referred.  Observed from this
"rest"  frame,  clocks  in  all  others  run  more  slowly,  and  objects  in  all  other  frames  are
contracted.    Also,  as  seen  from  this  chosen  frame,  the  various  relativistic  phenomena
occurring in other frames interact such that these effects are not detectable by observers in
those frames.

Lorentz  and  Einstein  came  to  fundamentally  different  interpretations  as  to  the  physical
reality behind this situation.  To preserve the classical role of time in the universe at large,
Lorentz argued that there is some reference frame, corresponding to a state of absolute rest,
in which time is not dilated.  Viewed from this preferred frame, events in other frames are
seen to behave exactly as they do when one arbitrarily chooses a rest frame in solving a
relativity problem.  However, the relativistic effects observed from this frame are considered
objectively  real.    As  Lorentz  repeatedly  pointed  out,  such  an  approach  is  equivalent  to
Einstein's  space-time  interpretation  from  the  standpoints  of  both  mathematics  and
experiment.  (At least as far as special relativity is concerned.)

Einstein argued that since all reference frames are subjectively equivalent (with respect to
linear motion), it necessarily complicates things to assume that one is preferred.  Much of the
force of this argument comes from the idea that a preferred frame system requires the ad hoc
assumption of relativistic transformations.  However, Einstein's space-time interpretation
does include a preferred frame for rotational motion.  (While linear motion is defined by
equivalent reference frames derived from space-time geometry, Einstein postulated that
rotational motion is defined by "the fixed stars" -- a preferred frame.)  So, while preferred
frames are not eliminated, there is the additional complication of different frames for linear
and rotational motion.  Another difficulty with the space-time interpretation of relativity is
that it does not account for the direction of entropy; an additional time-like factor of some
sort seems to be required.

In  this  theory,  as  in  Lorentz's  "Theory  of  Electrons,
  one  consistent,  preferred  frame  of
#
reference defines both linear and rotational motion.   Also, both incorporate classical time,
which  can  be  taken  as  directional  in  nature,  giving  a  preferred  direction  for  entropy.
However, in this theory, all relativistic transformations spring directly from the physical
system involved, and need not be assumed ad hoc, as Lorentz did for relativistic contraction.

For a reference frame moving in the x direction, the Lorentz transform equations are:

(3-4)

Of  course,  within  the  context  of  a  preferred  frame  system,  Eq.  (3-1)  means  that  objects
actually contract along their direction of motion.  Eq. (3-4) means that moving clocks run
more  slowly in an absolute sense.  And, moving clocks which are separated along their
direction of motion are desynchronized by an absolute amount of time.  

For those unaccustomed to preferred frames, I'd like to illustrate their nature with a physical
analogy.  It’s a (tongue-in-cheek) thought experiment involving sound: Three nearsighted
cowboys are riding atop a train, in the open air.  Our men are on different cars, with the
length of five identical cars separating each of them.  The two outside cowboys want to
synchronize their watches, but their distance vision is much too poor to use visual signals.

So they call to the middle cowboy to shoot his gun, and both start their watches when they
hear the shot.  However, because the train is moving, the sound must travel farther through
the air to reach the forward cowboy than it does to reach the man in back.  The cowboy in
the middle, a bright fellow named Al, realizes there may be a problem.  So, to check their
synchronization, he has the other cowboys shoot their guns when their watches read exactly
one o'clock.  What does he hear?  

Al  hears  two  simultaneous  shots.    On  that  basis,  he  decides  that  the  watches  really  are
synchronized, and also concludes that the speed of sound outside is invariant with respect
to moving trains.  His mistake, of course, was forgetting that the sound from the rear had to
travel  farther through the air to reach him than the sound from up ahead.  This exactly
cancels the discrepancy of the two watches.  So, he really has no way of knowing, from the
timing of sounds, whether the watches are actually synchronized or not.*  This is precisely
the way light behaves in preferred reference frame systems, such as the ether-based model
of Lorentz.

*Some wonder whether Al might hear a difference in pitch between the two sounds, due to
Doppler shifting.  Of course he would if he were stationary with respect to the air.  However,
because of his motion, Al experiences Doppler shifts at the receiving end which cancel those
at the sources.  For example, the sound from ahead is shifted to a lower absolute pitch, but
he intercepts these waves at an increased rate.

22

It was Poincaré who first noted that, in a system like Lorentz's, if an observer's senses were
mediated entirely by electromagnetic waves, he would have no way of discerning relativistic
effects within his own reference frame, and no way of knowing how fast his frame is moving
relative  to  the ether.  Lorentz's theory does contain the ad-hoc assumption that moving
particles  and  objects  contract  along  their  direction  of  motion.    However,  given  this,  the
remaining effects of special relativity result naturally from the behavior of electromagnetic
waves traveling at a uniform speed through a fixed ether.

In its treatment of light, Lorentz's theory is an elegant one.  Although the contraction of
material objects is assumed, this assumption doesn't pertain to light; the lengths of light
waves are naturally correct as the result of Doppler shifting.  Time dilation automatically
results from these waves traveling increased distances through the ether in moving frames.
And,  time  desynchronization  in  moving  frames  results  from  light  waves  traveling  with
differing relative velocities in different directions, just like the sound waves in our cowboy
analogy.

(For a more complete discussion of Lorentz/Poincaré relativity, see J. S. Bell
.  Bell argues
that their preferred-frame approach is preferable for teaching special relativity, and reiterates
its experimental equivalence to Einstein's space-time.  He also describes how, for a classical
atom with a non-radiating electron, Lorentz's contraction assumption can be avoided by
invoking Maxwell's equations.)  Having noted some appealing features of preferred frames,
now we'll take up relativity in the context of our new wave system.

15

As shown earlier, when this 4-D system is viewed from the perspective of a 3-D reference
space, the waves associated with pro-particles resemble de Broglie waves.  De Broglie based
the  equations  for  his  waves  on  Einstein's  relativity;  consequently,  they  are  inherently
relativistic with respect to both space and time.  The waves in this new system will be seen
to behave in the same relativistic fashion.  Also, we'll find that this automatically brings
relativistic  behavior  to  our  provisional  particles  (as  well  as  to  the  realistic  particles
introduced later).

 axis,
Recall that a pro-particle corresponds to a line in Euclidean 4-space, paralleling the 
and represents points of varying phase on redundant waves.  (Or a single point in our 3-D
reference space.)  The fronts of the associated waves all make the same angle with respect to
the line of the pro-particle.  And the points making up the 4-D pro-particle line all have the
same velocity vector, so they move together.  As we've seen, for a pro-particle to move in the
3-D  reference space, its associated wavefronts must be tilted with respect to 
.  Here we'll
look at some hyperplane wavefronts and assume that they are tilted by some process which
leaves the length of a given section of wavefront unchanged.  (A mechanism which tilts
waves in this fashion will be described later.)  What effect would such tilting have on an
arrangement of our pro-particles?

Figs.  3-1(a)  and  (b)  show  a  pair  of  pro-particles,  A  and  B,  associated  with  the  same
hyperplane waves.  (As before, vectors on the right represent the pro-particle motions.)  In
(a) the wavefronts are perpendicular to

Fig. 3-1(b) shows the same wavefronts, tilted, with the pro-particles moving at velocity v.

assumption) is d , while d is the apparent distance seen in the reference space,

The  factor                            corresponds  to  Lorentz-Fitzgerald  contraction.   As  you  might
expect,  Eq. (3-1) can be derived from this effect.  To do this, we'll put things in terms of the
usual two coordinate systems.  Unprimed coordinates x, y, z, and t will refer to our preferred
frame and coordinates x', y', z', t' to a frame moving with the pro-particles.  We let the x and
x'  origins  correspond  to  the  position  of  A  at  time  t  =  0.    In  our  preferred  frame,  the  x
coordinate of pro-particle B is then given by

When v = 0, we have d = d  = x = x'.  If measurements are made in terms of pro-particle
spacings,  then  within  a  moving  reference  frame,  there  are  no  measurable  differences  in
lengths or distances at different frame velocities.  (This is because any arrangement of pro-
particles that might be used as a measuring stick contracts along with any other.)  So, we can
take x' to be invariant.  If x' and d  are both invariant, and equal when v = 0, we also have x'
= d .  Substituting for d  in Eq. (3-7) gives

If  a  hyperplane  is  tilted  in  the  x  and

coordinates of points on the hyperplane.  So, for pro-particles moving only in x, where the
wavefronts tilt only in x and

and z' = z, the second and third Lorentz transform equations.

Earlier, we found that, at the moving position of a pro-particle, the frequency of its associated
waves decreases as                          , corresponding to relativistic time dilation.  If we assume
that a pro-particle effectively measures time by the phase of its waves, we can derive Eq. (3-
4), the fourth Lorentz transform equation.  (The assumption will be borne out later.)

Fig. 3-2 shows the waves and pro-particles of Fig. 3-1 once again.  As depicted on the left,
when the pro-particles are stationary in the reference space, the waves have the same phases
at  A  and  B.    With  moving  pro-particles,  shown  on  the  right,  a  wavefront  crossing  the
reference space at A won't reach it at B until some later time.  So pro-particle B lags A in
phase.

Here  we'll  write  an  equation  describing  a  representative  wavefront,  in  preferred  frame
coordinates, as a function of pro-particle velocity.  At time t = 0, we let the wavefront cross
the reference space at x = 0 (where we've placed pro-particle A).  From the vector triangle on

In terms of pro-particles themselves, there can't be any measurable time dilation within

Moving Mirrors

So far, no mechanism has been suggested for the wave transformations we've been exploring.
Here, we'll take this mechanism to be reflection.  In deriving the Lorentz transform above,
two basic assumptions were made.  The first was that our waves are tilted by some means
which leaves the length of a hyperplane wavefront section unchanged.  The second was that,
somehow, pro-particles effectively measure time by the phases of their associated waves.
Below, we'll see that these assumptions can be superseded by a single, more definitive one:
that all our waves have been reflected at some point.

To obtain our wave transformation, our basic approach will be to ask what would happen
to these waves if the "mirrors" from which they reflected had had different velocities.  We'll
see that, when the mirror velocity is changed, the reflected waves are transformed such that,
within another relativistic frame, they have exactly the same configurations and states of
motion that they otherwise would have had.  In other words, the effect of this "moving
mirror transform" is a complete Lorentz transformation.  

What sort of "mirror" are we talking about?  In keeping with the rest of this theory, the
mirrors we will be considering here are themselves wave-based phenomena.  While the
physical reflection mechanism won't be addressed until a later chapter, the point here is this:
Unlike "solid" objects, these wave-based mirrors can pass through the wave medium without
having to push it out of the way.  For example, suppose you had a sound-reflecting concrete
wall  moving  through  air;  the  induced  airflow  around  the  wall  would  influence  the
propagation of reflecting sound waves.  Here, we won't be concerned with such an effect.

, any wave-based mirror surface that may arise
Since our wave system is redundant along 
must have an overall orientation parallel to this axis.  (That is, on a scale larger than the wave
structure's period, s.)  We'll also add the working assumption that our mirror surfaces are
locally  straight and continuous along 
.  (This will be justified later, when the physical
reflection mechanism is discussed.)

To begin, we need a reflection law for our moving mirrors.  For a stationary mirror, there is
the familiar law of reflection: the angle of reflection equals that of incidence, with angles
measured with respect to a surface normal.  This no longer holds when the mirror moves.
Here we'll use Huygens' principle to find a more general law, while making some qualitative
observations.

Fig. 3-3(a) depicts a hyperplane wavefront being reflected by a moving mirror.  The mirror
is a also hyperplane, perpendicular to the x axis, moving in the positive x direction with
velocity w.  A broken vertical line, M , represents the mirror at time t = 0, while the solid line,
M ,  shows  the  mirror  at  a  later  time,  t  =  1.    Both  the  incident  and  reflected  waves  are
 plane.  The bent angled lines, F  and F , represent the wavefront at
perpendicular to the x,
times t = 0 and t = 1 respectively.  The upper sections of F  and F  are moving up and to the
0 
left, while the lower sections, having been reflected, are moving up and to the right.

t=0 and t=1, respectively.  F  and F  are a reflecting wavefront at these times.  The
corresponding points of contact between wavefront and mirror are P  and P .  In (b),
the mirror is omitted and the mirror/wavefront contact surface, S, is shown.  Also
added are normals to S at P  and P .  A is an incident and B a reflected ray.

Fig. 3-4.  Another case of reflection by a moving mirror.  Instead of moving toward
it, here the mirror retreats from the incident wavefront.

28

As shown in Fig. 3-3(a), the wavefront contacts the mirror at P  at time t = 0, and at P  at t =
1.  A Huygens' wavelet originating from P  at t = 0 becomes the semicircle shown at time t
= 1.  By Huygens' principle, the lower section of wavefront F  must be tangent to this wavelet
and pass through P .  A vector with magnitude c depicts the wavelet expansion and also the
wavefront speed.  A smaller vector, with magnitude w, depicts the relative mirror velocity.
You can see that, for an increasing w, point P  is shifted to the right of P .  This causes the
reflected wavefront to approach a vertical orientation and reflected rays to approach the
horizontal, closer to a mirror normal (not shown).

A second case is illustrated in Fig. 3-4(a).  Unlike the last, where the mirror moves toward
the incident wavefront, here it retreats, in the -x direction.  As a result, P  is shifted to the left
of P .  Here, the reflected wavefront has a less vertical orientation, and the reflected rays are
less horizontal, deflected away from a mirror normal.  Summarizing, when a mirror moves
toward incident waves, the reflected rays are brought closer to a mirror normal.  Or, when the mirror
retreats, reflected rays are shifted away from the normal.

1

Figs. 3-3(b) and 3-4(b) show the same mirror/wavefront interactions depicted in parts (a).
In parts (b), the mirror surface is not shown and the wavefront motion vectors are labeled
A and B instead of c.  A and B can be taken to represent the movements of a pair of pro-
particles  associated  with  the  wavefront.    (Of  course  these  vectors  are  normal  to  the
wavefront.)  The tails of these vectors lie on F  and correspond to the positions of these pro-
0
particles at time t = 0, while the heads lie on F  and correspond to t = 1.  (Following previous
1
diagrams, the pro-particle positions at times t = 0 and 1 might have been illustrated with
vertical lines.  These are omitted to keep the figure readable.)

Added in Figs. 3-3(b) and 3-4(b) is a line, S, running through points P  and P .  S represents
the surface where, at different times, the mirror and wavefront make contact.  (S differs for
different wavefronts.)  Also added are a pair of normals to S, at points at points P  and P .
1
From the identical triangles bounded by F , A, S and F , B, S, you can see that the angle 
0  
(cid:21)
between a normal to S and the incident pro-particle vector, A, equals the angle between a
normal and the reflected pro-particle vector, B.  What we have, then, is just the ordinary law of
reflection,  except  that,  for  each  wavefront,  we  take  as  our  mirror  the  mirror/wavefront  contact
surface.*  This is the generalized law for moving mirrors.  It says that what matters is not the
mirror orientation per se, but where each point of a mirror is when a wavelet reflects from
it.

Now we're ready to derive our wave transformation.  For simplicity, we'll be working with
hyperplane mirrors.  (The same wave transformation also occurs with other mirror shapes.)
We'll choose our coordinate system such that the x dimension is perpendicular to the mirror
surface.  In whatever direction the actual mirror may move, the velocity of its surface then
can then be given entirely in terms of its x component.  (This is because any y, z, or 
 velocity
components then are parallel to the surface and don't change its effective positioning.)

1

*Of  course  there  is  a  second  difference  between  ordinary  reflection  and  reflection  from
moving mirrors: Doppler shifting.   In addition to being tilted, wave trains are compressed
and expanded, exactly like the wavefronts shown in Fig. 2-2.

29

Given  that  the  mirror  is  a  hyperplane,  we  can  immediately  address  one  of  our  earlier
assumptions:  that  our  waves  are  tilted  by  some  means  which  leaves  the  length  of  a
hyperplane wavefront section unchanged.  When the moving mirror and wavefronts are
both hyperplanes, the mirror/wavefront contact surface is a hyperplane also.  In this case,
the effective mirror is flat, of course, and reflection by a flat mirror doesn't change the length
of a wavefront section.

Next, we'll begin to address the other assumption made in deriving the Lorentz transform -
that pro-particles effectively measure time by the phases of their waves.  In theories with
preferred reference frames, like this one, time itself is unchanged in moving frames.  What
changes instead is the behavior of things in time -- velocities in particular.  (For example, the
hands of a moving watch turn more slowly, in an absolute sense, than those of a watch at
rest.)  Below, we'll show that pro-particle velocities are transformed relativistically by the
motion of a reflecting hyperplane mirror.  Since their velocities necessarily determine the
rates  by  which  systems  of  pro-particles  would  gauge  time,  the  previous  assumption
concerning wave phases will be unnecessary.

First, from our generalized law of reflection, we'll derive a set of equations for the velocities
of pro-particles reflected by moving mirrors.  Unlike the two-dimensional work done so far,
here we’ll describe all four dimensions of our system this.  (Consequently, the derivation is
a  little  long.)    Then  we'll  use  these  equations  to  give  us  those  for  the  relativistic
transformation of velocity.

Moving Mirrors in 4-D

Fig.  3-5(a)  shows  the  basic  4-D  vectors  we'll  use  to  write  a  set  of  velocity  equations  for
reflected  pro-particles.    Each  vector  corresponds  to  a  velocity  with  magnitude  c.*    A
represents  the  motion  of  an  incident  pro-particle,  while  C  is  the  same  pro-particle  after
reflection.  Also shown is a slanted line, S, which again represents the mirror/wavefront
contact surface.  Vector B is an artificial construct, normal to this fixed surface.  (B doesn't
correspond to the movement of anything.)  As with ordinary reflection, from our generalized
law, -A, B, and C are separated by equal angles and lie in a plane.  

Fig.  3-5.    Vectors  used  to  describe  4-D  reflection.    S  is  the
mirror/wavefront  contact  surface.    On  the  right,  vector  C  is
displaced to show its relationship to A and B.

Given A and the mirror movement, we'll construct vector B.  Then, as illustrated in Fig. 3-
5(b), we can use the equation

to find C from vectors A and B.

usual optical notation, where reflected rays are indicated with primes.  However, in the
relativistic equations we’ll be deriving here, primes signify moving reference frames.)

While  4-D  vectors  will  be  used  to  guide  our  analysis,  what  we're  after  are  equations
describing pro-particle reflection in 3-D terms.  Thus we'll be going back and forth between
the above 4 and 3-D velocity representations.

To find vector B, we need an equation for the mirror/wavefront contact hyperplane.  This
can be found by solving simultaneous equations for the mirror and incident wavefront.  We'll
start by writing the wavefront equation.  In our 4-D space, the normal form for the equation
of a fixed hyperplane is

If we take our wavefront to cross the origin at time t = 0, the perpendicular distance, p, from
the  origin  to  the  wavefront,  is  given  by  ct.    Since  vector  A  is  normal  to  the  incident
wavefront, the direction cosines of a perpendicular are given by A's components divided by
its magnitude, c.  Putting all these into Eq. (3-27), we have an equation for the wavefront as
a function of time:

Next,  we'll put this hyperplane equation into normal form.  In so doing, the coordinate
coefficients will give us the direction cosines for vector B.  In the normal form, the sum of the
squared coordinate coefficients equals one.  We can satisfy this condition with an appropriate
value for k.  Setting the squared coefficients equal to one, we have

These last three equations, describing pro-particle reflection in 3-D terms, are the set we've

*If both sides of this equation are divided by c, it also describes the relativistic reflection of
light from a mirror moving in x.  When this is done, v /c and v /c are the direction cosines
for incident and reflected light rays in, for example, the x-y plane.  This equation is given in
Einstein's 1905 "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies".  However, unlike Einstein, who
derived it from a "principle" of relativity, here we've done so from a physical system, without
assuming this principle.

Relativistic Velocity Transformation

From  our  pro-particle  reflection  equations,  now  we  can  derive  those  for  the  relativistic
transformation of velocity.  These are: 

where u is a velocity observed in some chosen "rest" frame, and u' is the corresponding
velocity measured within a "moving" reference frame, with a relative velocity, v, in the x
dimension.  (While the previously derived Lorentz equations transform coordinates from a
"rest" frame to a frame in relative motion, these equations go the opposite way.  This form
was chosen here because Eq. (3-57) is the familiar "addition of velocities" equation.)

Our approach will be to compare the final velocities of the same incident pro-particle after
reflection by a fixed mirror and by a moving one.  We'll see that the effect of mirror motion
is to transform the reflected velocity according to Eqs. (3-57)-(3-59) above.  The (invariant)
velocity, u', will correspond to a fixed mirror, while the transformed velocity, u, will result
from a moving one.  Also, we'll see that the reference frame velocity, v, is a function of the
mirror velocity, w.

To describe the reflection of a pro-particle by a fixed mirror, we can put a zero value for the
mirror velocity, w, in Eqs. (3-54)-(3-56).  In this case, of course the incident and reflected
velocities  are  equal,  except  that  the  x  component  is  reversed.    So,  calling  this  reflected
velocity u', we can write

If we put a zero value for u' in Eqs. (3-63)-(3-65), the resulting velocity, u, has no y or z
components and is given entirely by Eq. (3-63).  This reduces to

For a pro-particle which is stationary after "reflection" from a fixed mirror, this gives the
velocity of the same incident pro-particle after reflection from a moving one.  If the effect of
mirror motion is a relativistic transformation of velocity, then this pro-particle should be
stationary once again in some new relativistic frame.  In other words, its velocity would
correspond to that of this new frame.  This gives

where v is the reference frame velocity corresponding to a given mirror velocity, w.  (Notice
the similarity to Eq. (3-57).)

In the case of a pro-particle with an arbitrary value of u', the transformed velocity, u, should
have a proper relativistic value in the reference frame specified by the last equation.  If we
can demonstrate this, it would establish that our moving mirror transform is relativistic for
reflected pro-particles in general.

Here we've seen that, using Eq. (3-67) as the velocity of our moving reference frame, all of
the relativistic velocity transform equations are obtained.  Again, this shows that the 3-D
velocity of any reflected pro-particle (not just an initially motionless one) is transformed to
its proper value for this moving frame.

As noted previously, reflection from a moving hyperplane mirror tilts wavefronts without
changing the 4-D wavefront length between pro-particles.  Earlier, we found that, given this
condition, we could derive the first three Lorentz equations for the transformation of space.
From  those  equations,  plus  these  just  obtained  for  velocity,  the  last  Lorentz  transform
equation, for time, can be derived.  (This is just a reversal of the usual derivation of the
velocity transform from that for space and time.)  So, this "moving mirror" transform is a
complete one.

Also, in our initial derivation of the Lorentz transform, we only considered pairs of pro-
particles, with identical velocities, associated with the same hyperplane waves.  As derived
here,  the  transform  applies  to  any  ensemble  of  reflected  pro-particles,  having  any
combination of velocities.  Thus, if everything were somehow made of such pro-particles,
we'd have a relativistic system.  Later, when we arrive at more realistic particles, we'll find
that, since they exist within the same wave system, they inherit the basic relativistic behavior
of these reflected pro-particles.

 Flows and the Scalar Potential

1

So far, we've been treating the waves in this system as though they might be linear ones.
However, as mentioned earlier, this theory is based on flow waves, and these are inherently
nonlinear.  As a first step toward exploring their nonlinear interactions, here we'll look at
interactions of steady flows and waves.  In particular, we'll be examining flows directed
along the 
 dimension, and their effects on the motion of pro-particles.  We'll see that these
effects are identical to those of stationary scalar electric potentials on charged particles.*

1

Just as sound is reflected and refracted by a stream of moving air, so too are the waves in this
system, when they encounter flows.  In analyzing these effects, we'll use the approach taken
for reflection by a moving mirror:  First we'll use Huygens' principle to derive a law -- of
refraction here -- then we'll apply it to the behavior of pro-particles.  We'll be working in just
two dimensions again, for simplicity, instead of the full 4-dimensional space.  We'll also
change to optical notation, using primes now to indicate quantities "after refraction.

while in the shaded area it moves downward with velocity U'.  As shown in (a), the
effect here is to decrease the angle,

Part (b) shows the corresponding refraction of a ray.

Fig. 4-1(a) depicts a wavefront entering a flow region.  While the wave medium (stuff) has
no overall flow on the left, on the right it flows directly downward with velocity U' in the 
1
dimension.  (As in ordinary fluids, there is always a continuous gradient  between different
flows.  However, we'll assume that the gradient width here is arbitrarily small, so we have
a sharp interface.)  The broken line, F , depicts just the incident portion of the wavefront,
which is moving up and to the right, at time t = 0.  The bent, solid line, F , shows the whole
wavefront, including the refracted part, at a later time, t = 1.

As usual, vectors with magnitude c are rays, normal to the wavefront.  Points P  and P  are
the successive intersection points between the wavefront and interface.  The semicircle to the
right of P   represents a Huygens wavelet which originated at this point at t = 0.  As depicted
by the vector U', the wavelet is displaced by the flow, so at t = 1 its center is located at C .1
(Like the circular ripples from a tossed stone, carried downstream by a river.)  By Huygens'
principle, the refracted wavefront passes through point P  and is tangent to this wavelet.  The
effect here is to decrease the angle

(The preceding equations have been known for some time.  They can be found in Rayleigh's
1896 treatise, The Theory of Sound  [still in print], which has a section on the interaction of
wind and sound.  Rayleigh was particularly concerned with the observation that sound can
carry  downwind  for  surprising  distances.    He  credits  an  1857  paper  by  Stokes  as  first
pointing out the role of wind refraction in this effect.  Rayleigh also gives an interesting
account  of  various  experiments  on  the  effects  of  wind  on  sound.    Once  recognized
experimental physics could be done just by ringing a bell in an empty field, noting the wind,
and listening for the sound at different locations!)

Although our refraction equations are accurate, I'd like to mention that the physical picture
on which they are based is somewhat oversimplified.  Ribner  has pointed out that a straight
interface between two sharply divided flows is necessarily distorted by the pressures of

components.    (In  the  context  of  our  wave  system,  these  ripples  would  have  a 
  period
corresponding to the structure interval, s.)  Of course the 
 phase velocity of the ripples is
the same as that of the incident waves which cause them.  The result is that the additional
components  created  have  the  same  angles  as  the  basic  refracted  and  reflected  waves
described above.*

Although the wave angles are no different with this effect, the predicted amplitudes change
significantly.  What's involved is the transfer of energy between the flows and waves.  Thus
the waves are nonlinear.  Also, in terms of the incident wave amplitude, the effect is first
order, so it can't be neglected.  (It would be interesting to know its role in downwind sound
propagation.)  Ribner gives corrected equations for the refracted and transmitted amplitudes.
The condition for total reflection remains Eq. (4-5).  However, at this point we won't be
concerned with amplitudes.

It follows that, when a pro-particle enters a 
 flow of the same sign, its 3-D velocity decreases.  Or,
if it enters a flow of the opposite sign, the velocity increases.  This behavior is analogous to that of
free charged particles entering different electric potentials.  As we'll see, the analogy is an
exact one.

If we also substitute for QU from Eq. (4-12), this gives Eq. (4-15), the wave frequency of a real
particle in a scalar potential.  So here we find another fundamental similarity between the
waves of this new system and those of quantum mechanics.

We've seen now that pro-particles can precisely model various features of particles having
a single rest mass, m .  Of course, in nature, not all particles have the same mass.  Another
apparent shortcoming of this particle model is that, as ray analogues, pro-particles can be
partially refracted and reflected.  Of course, when real particles, such as electrons, meet sharp
changes in the scalar potential, they are either "refracted" or reflected; the whole particle goes
one way or the other.

fundamental  characteristics  of  the  waves  in  this  system.    In  a  subsequent  section,  more
complex wave-based entities will be introduced, which resemble real particles much more
closely.  However, because they exist within the same relativistic wave system, they may

5. Flow Waves and the Vector Potential

In  the  last  section,  we  found  a  correspondence  between  the  behavior  of  pro-particles  in
 flows, and that of real charged particles in scalar potentials.  Taking a similar
stationary 
approach, here we'll describe pro-particles entering moving 
 flows.  This will be compared
to real particles entering moving scalar/vector potentials.  In so doing, we'll introduce the
vector potential, while further defining the nature of the scalar potential in this theory.

1

1

A basis for moving 
 flows is provided by another feature of our wave system: its flows are
not  steady  ones,  but  are  due  to  acoustic  flow  waves.    (So,  while  flows  influence  the
propagation of waves, these also consist of waves themselves.)  We'll see that the lateral
movement  of 
  flows  is  made  possible  by  this  underlying  wave  nature.    To  introduce
acoustic flow waves, we'll begin by looking at the familiar example of sound waves in air.

1

A  common  device for describing sound wave generation is an air-filled cylinder with a
piston.  Suppose we have a very long cylinder, aligned with the x axis, and a piston which
makes waves that propagate in the +x direction.  If the piston oscillates around a fixed point
(like a stereo speaker), there is no net movement of the air in the cylinder and we have what
are regarded as ordinary sound waves.

What happens if the piston does not oscillate around a fixed point?  For example, suppose
it starts abruptly, moves some distance in the positive x direction, and stops abruptly.  Here,
a rectangular flow wave pulse is created, with a density greater than the surrounding air.
As it moves down the cylinder, the effect of this pulse is to displace individual air particles,
on average, by the same distance traveled by the piston.  (Otherwise, near the piston, we
would see a lasting, local increase in the air density and pressure.)  This pulse represents a
moving region of flow, in which the average velocity of the air particles matches that of the
moving piston.

By repeatedly moving the piston, only in the positive x direction, and stopping it, we can also
generate a series of such pulses.  Like the water solitons in Fig. 1-5, the waves then would
carry an intermittent, but continuing, flow.*  Likewise, by repeatedly moving and stopping
the piston in the negative x direction, we can generate a train of pulses (moving positively
in x) with negative relative density.  Note that, in this last case, the net flow is opposite the
wave movement.

"Ordinary" acoustic waves can be viewed as a special case of flow waves.  These involve flow
wave components of both positive and negative relative density, where these components
are exactly equal in magnitude and have identical velocity vectors.

*This progressive driving (as opposed to oscillating) mode of wave generation is common
in nature.  For example, this is essentially how sound is produced when you speak or play
a wind instrument.

49

As with steady flows, other waves are refracted and reflected by flow waves.  A simplified
example is illustrated in Fig. 5-1.  Parallel lines in the region on the right represent flow
 dimension.  An average downward flow, represented by
waves, moving vertically in the 
the vector U' is associated with these.  Here we'll assume that these waves are such that the
fluid density inside the flow wave region is the same as that outside it.  (We can meet this
condition as described below.)  Incident on the flow wave region is a wavefront associated
with  longer-wavelength,  small-amplitude  waves.    As  indicated  by  the  vector  c,  this  is
moving up and to the right.

lines represent positive density waves, moving in the -
 direction, while broken lines
mark  negative  density  waves,  going  the  opposite  way.    Vector  U'  indicates  the
average net flow.

1

We know that, despite the chaotic motion of air particles at the molecular level, at larger
scales, sound wave behavior is given by the average motions of air particles.  From this, we
can  infer  that,  if  the  scale  of  our  flow  waves  is  relatively  minuscule,  the  refraction  and
reflection of larger-scale waves should be determined by only the average flow, U'.  (Also,
with very  short-wavelength flow waves, we can neglect diffraction at the boundary.)  So the
figure just depicts the usual refracted and reflected of wavefronts resulting from such a flow.
This illustrates a nonlinear wave effect which is independent of the wave medium.  Instead, it depends
entirely on a property of the waves themselves: their associated flow.

Notice that the downward flow, U', in Fig. 5-1 could be realized by either positive density
waves (solid lines) traveling downward or waves of negative relative density (broken lines)
traveling upward.  To meet our assumption that the fluid medium has the same average
density inside the flow wave region as outside, these must be a balanced combination of both
types.  (For example, if we had positive waves only, the net density in the flow wave region
would be greater.)  As with "ordinary" acoustic waves, here we have equal positive and
negative density components.  But in this case, they are moving oppositely.

50

Referring again to a very long, air-filled cylinder, we can visualize the generation of such
complementary flow waves.  In this example, instead of having a piston, the ends of the
cylinder are plugged.  Here, waves are created inside the cylinder by moving the whole unit
along the x axis.  Suppose this cylinder is moved repeatedly, in the +x direction only, and
stopped.    At  one  end  plug,  waves  of  positive  density  are  produced,  traveling  in  the  +x
direction.  Also, from the opposite end, there are corresponding pulses of negative density,
going in the -x direction.  With or without the waves, of course the net air density inside the
closed cylinder remains the same.*

Fig.  5-2.    Moving  flow  wave  regions.    The  3-D  velocity  of  their  left  edges  is  v,  that  of
associated pro-particles.  Positive and negative density flow waves are depicted in (a) and
(b) respectively, while (c) represents a balanced combination.  In (c), the net average flow,
U ', parallels the 

 axis.

*Ship  waves  are  another  example  of  balanced  flow  waves.    At  the  bow,  where  the  hull
displaces water, waves of positive net amplitude are produced.  Although less noticeable,
at the stern, waves of negative amplitude are also created.  These bow and stern waves can
move independently, with different velocities and trajectories.  Since the overall ocean level
doesn't change, of course the net amplitudes must be exactly opposite.

51

Here we return to the present theory, and the mechanism for the movement of localized 
1
flows.  These move laterally in the x, y and z dimensions, without a corresponding migration
of the surrounding fluid, stuff.  For steady flows, this would seem impossible.  However, as
suggested in Fig. 5-2, such traveling flows can be realized on the basis of flow waves.

Fig. 5-2(a) shows a localized set of positive density flow waves, whose left edge is moving
in the positive x direction.  Again, in this simplified example, we'll assume their wavelength
is arbitrarily short, so diffraction can be neglected.  The edge's motion in the reference space
corresponds to that of a pro-particle associated with the waves, represented by vector v in
the vector triangle at the right.  The vector U ', shown underneath, represents the average
1
flow associated with the waves.  Here this has the same direction as the wave motion, with
components in the negative 

 and positive x directions.

1

Another set of flow waves, with the same x velocity, v, appears in Fig. 5-2(b).  These are
  direction.    As
moving  to  the  right,  like  the  last  set,  but  also  upward,  in  the  opposite 
indicated by broken lines, these are waves of negative relative density.  Here the associated
flow, U ', is opposite the wave motion.  The 
 component of this flow is negative, as in (a),
while the x flow component is opposite.

1

1

2

Fig. 5-2(c) shows a combination of two such wave sets.  This represents balanced waves of
positive and negative density, where again the average fluid density inside the wave region
equals that outside it.  Because they have the same velocity, v, in the reference space, the two
wave sets travel together.  The average net flow, U , is given by the vector sum of U ' and U '.
2
The x components of the latter are exactly opposite, since these are the products of v and the
average wave amplitudes.  So, these cancel and U ' parallels the 

 axis.

(Note that, while the wavefronts in Fig. 5-2(c) are depicted as straight, this may only be
correct for small amplitudes.  At larger amplitudes, these waves may distort one another,
giving "wavy" fronts.  Also, at large amplitudes, the 4-D component wave velocities may
differ from c.  Nevertheless, with appropriate tilts of the component waves, these should still
move together in the reference space.)

This introduces another general quality of the wave system in this theory: its flow waves are
 dimension.  (If not, it would follow that light or
balanced, such that net flows only occur in the 
actual particles could be observed moving faster than c.)  Below, we'll see that scalar/vector
potentials  correspond  exactly  to  localized 
  flows,  moving  in  x,  y  and  z,  without  net
movements of the fluid itself in these dimensions.

1

1

While we've been primarily concerned with the refractive effects of 
 flows, they also reflect
waves, as illustrated in Fig. 5-1 for a stationary flow wave region.  Earlier, in deriving the
Lorentz transform, we assumed a reflection mechanism aligned with the 
 axis.  This was
assumed to move through the wave medium without inducing a flow around the mirror.
Notice that, in these moving, wave-based 

 flows, we have such a mechanism.

 flow regions transform if they themselves were
How would the balanced waves of moving 
reflected by moving mirrors?  For small amplitude waves, our previous "moving mirror"
transform  applies  directly.    Transforming  a  stationary  flow  wave  region,  such  as  that
depicted in Fig. 5-1, gives a moving region like that shown in Fig. 5-2(c).  As before, the 4-D
length of hyperplane wavefront sections is unchanged, while the width of a moving wave
region is contracted relativistically by the usual factor.  Since they have opposite 
 velocities,
the  positive  and  negative  density  component  waves  tilt  oppositely  with  respect  to  the
reference space.

1

It's assumed that, in combination, the flow waves of this system transform relativistically at
larger amplitudes also.  (Because they are incomplete, the simplified waves of Figs. 5-1 and
5-2  probably  would  not  behave  properly  at  large  amplitudes.)    Another  important
assumption  is  that  each  complementary  pair  of  wavefronts  crossing  the  reference  space
 displacement of the wave medium.  (As described later, it should be
carries an invariant 
 flow is then
possible to check these assumptions by computer simulation.)  The average 
proportional to the flow wave frequency seen in the reference space.

Given this, what is the transformed 
 flow for a moving wave region?  Calling the region
velocity w now, at a fixed point in the reference space the flow wave frequency differs by the
  flow seen at a fixed
factor                                .    Consequently,  we can write the average 
point as

where U  is the flow of a corresponding stationary wave region.  So, while the region width
contracts  by the factor                   , the effective flow per unit width increases by the
reciprocal, and total flow is conserved.  In this respect, our wave-based flows behave the
same as ordinary ones, and our assumption that the associated 
 flow is proportional to the
flow wave frequency seems justified.

Note that the wave frequency at a moving point in the reference space is dependant on its
 flow at such a point depends on its velocity also.  (I.e.,
velocity.  Consequently, the effective 
if  more  flow  waves  are  encountered,  the  effective  flow  increases,  and  vice  versa.)    For
example,  at  a  point  moving  together  with  a  flow  wave  region,  the  wave  frequency  is
decreased by                         .  So, calling the effective flow at such a moving position U , we

We've seen that it’s possible, in principle, to have wave-based, localized 
 flows which move
in x, y and z, without the displacement of the surrounding fluid in these dimensions.  Given
that our flows move in this fashion, we can derive the vector potential.  Once more, we'll
 flow
begin by looking at refraction at a sharp interface.  Since this depends on the effective

at a position moving with the interface, we'll also take it that the transformed 
 flow is that
given by Eq. (5-2), for an interface velocity, w.

For a qualitative introduction to the vector potential, we'll assume for the moment that our
 flows are effectively steady.  To visualize such flows, you could imagine that the
refracting 
responsible  waves  are  of  a  much  smaller  scale  than  the  waves  being  refracted,  like  the
example of Fig. 5-1.

principle, the refracted portion of wavefront F  is tangent to this wavelet and passes through

P .  However, unlike our earlier refraction examples, here P  is displaced by the interface
movement.  This displacement, indicated by the vector, d, is along the incident wavefront.
As  a  result,  in  this  case,  the  refraction  is  increased  by  the  interface  movement.    For

Wave Frequencies

Here we'll be looking at the effects of moving 
 flows on the frequency of refracted waves
in our system.  They will be compared to the effects of moving scalar/vector potentials on
de Broglie waves.  Later, we'll use these wave frequencies to compare the velocity behaviors
of pro-particles and actual charged particles.

1

Unlike our previous work with stationary 
 flows, where we only treated the x dimension
of the reference space, here we'll describe all three of its dimensions.  What we're after is a
general equation for the wave frequency, seen at an arbitrary moving point in the reference
space.  We'll call the 3-D velocity vector for this point u.  Also, the waves of interest will be
characterized by the 3-D velocity, v, of an associated pro-particle.

To  begin,  we'll  write  an  expression  for  the  frequency  with  no

Next, we'll write an equation for the effective flow of a moving 
 flow region.  Eq. (5-1) gives
the effective flow at a stationary point in the reference space.  Here we want this for an
 flow depends on the frequency of the
arbitrary moving point.  As mentioned, the effective 
 flow as a second set of waves, we can use their
underlying flow waves.  Treating the

The velocity, w, of a moving

with its flow waves.  Substituting w for the pro-particle velocity in Eq. (5-6), we can write
this flow wave frequency as

At a point with velocity u, the effect of such a flow on other waves is to shift the frequency
by QU /s.  (Again, Q has the value +1 for a positive pro-particle and -1 for a negative one.)

Now we'll develop a similar equation for de Broglie waves in moving potential regions.
Earlier,  we  looked  at  the  effects  of  stationary  scalar  potential  regions.    Here  we'll  be
concerned with scalar/vector potentials which are the moving, relativistic equivalent of
these.

Where 

 is the stationary scalar potential, the relativistic transformation for a 4-vector gives
0
0

(cid:9)
for the moving scalar potential, where w is the velocity of the potential region.  In addition,
there is now a vector potential*

The vector potential is also given by the simple relationship

(This combination of scalar and vector potentials is that of individual charged particles.  Of
course any mixture of electromagnetic potentials can be attributed to the combined effects
of such particles.)

Note that, when we speak of scalar and vector potentials here, we are referring only to those in a
single, specific reference frame.  This will correspond to the preferred frame defined by the medium
of our wave system.  (As Bell
 reiterates, if a physical system behaves relativistically in only
one frame, this is sufficient.)

As seen at a fixed spatial position, the frequency and wavelength of a particle's de Broglie
waves are given by the Planck and de Broglie relations

and

where h is Planck's constant, E is the particle's energy, and p its momentum.

the energy is actually independent of A.

Pro-particle and Particle Velocities

Earlier, we described the velocity of a charged particle entering a stationary scalar potential
region. To solve for the velocity, we used the conservation of energy for a "free" particle.
However, the energy of a relativistic particle entering a moving potential region is no longer
conserved.*  Instead, here we'll use a conserved de Broglie wave frequency.  For a potential
interface in motion, at its moving position, the wave frequencies on both sides must match.
Then we'll compare the velocity equations obtained to those for to pro-particles entering
moving 

 flows

1

For an actual particle, we'll begin by writing

(cid:31)w(cid:12)

(cid:10) (cid:31)w

where these are the de Broglie frequencies on both sides, at the interface of a scalar/vector
potential region with velocity w.  Again, primes refer to quantities inside the potential.

From Eq. (5-20), setting the position vector, u, equal to the potential region's velocity, w, we
can write expressions for the two sides of Eq. (5-21).  Outside the potential region, this gives

For a pro-particle, starting with Eqs. (5-21) and (5-9) and following the same basic procedure
leads to an analogous governing equation for the velocity:

(The solution for Eq. (5-27) was found geometrically from the wave representation provided
by this theory.  While the derivation is omitted for brevity, I think its directness illustrates
the utility of the 4-D Euclidean approach.  The solution given previously for a real particle
was actually gotten from this one.)

Eq. (5-20) for the de Broglie wave frequency is an interesting and versatile one.  By setting
the position vector, u, equal to the potential region velocity, w, we obtained our governing
equation for particle velocity.  We can also set u equal to 0, for the frequency at a stationary
position.  From E = h
, multiplying this frequency by h gives Eq. (5-18), the Hamiltonian of
the particle.  In addition, the Lagrangian can be obtained similarly.  This is related to the
frequency at the particle's moving position.  The usual form of the relativistic Lagrangian is19

Setting u equal to v in Eq. (5-20) yields the de Broglie frequency at the particle's position.
Simplifying  and  multiplying  by  -h  then  gives  the  Lagrangian  above.    (The  reason  for  a
negative  h  here  is  that  the  potential  energy  component  of  the  Lagrangian  is  defined  as
negative, while this is positive in the Hamiltonian.)

In classical electrodynamics, the Lagrangian gives rise to the force equation for a charged
particle in electric and magnetic fields.  (For example, see Duffy .)  In Gaussian units, this
is

Similarly, a quantity which behaves like the Lagrangian of Eq. (5-30) can be obtained for a
pro-particle, from the frequency at its moving position.  For example, setting u equal to v in
Eq. (5-9), and multiplying by -s gives an analogous quantity:

From this and the usual derivation for Eq. (5-31) from the Lagrangian, it would be possible
to write an analogous "force" equation for pro-particles.  This would give their behavior in
continuous 
 flow gradients, as opposed to that across sharp interfaces.  However, because
Eq.  (5-31) (which contains E and B) is only valid in classical electrodynamics, we won't
pursue its analogue here.

As described in Feynman, Leighton and Sands,
 electric and magnetic fields don't account
for quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the Aharanov-Bohm effect.  At the quantum
level, electromagnetic effects are seen instead in terms of the influence of scalar and vector
potentials on the phases of de Broglie waves.  This can correctly be expressed as

In this section, we've carefully avoided the issue of mutual flow wave interactions.  Here
we've only looked at the behavior of small-amplitude waves, in 
 flows driven by relatively
short-wavelength flow waves.  In this artificial case, there is no reciprocal effect of the former
waves  on  the  latter.    (This  is  basically  the  same  assumption  made  in  the  study  of
electromagnetism, when test charges are taken to have no effect on surrounding fields.)

1

Still, the flow waves in this system do interact mutually.  In this case, feedback arises.  For
example,  wave  set  A  refracts  and  reflects  set  B,  which,  by  altering  B's  effect  on  A,  then
changes A -- and so forth.  While such effects can be modeled by computer simulation, they
are difficult to treat analytically in more than one dimension.

Typically, feedback in nonlinear wave systems leads to pattern formation.  While the waves
 dimension, the nonlinear nature of flow waves
in this system remain repetitive in the 
should lead to additional patterns within the overall structure.  Such self-organizing patterns
are taken as the basis for the realistic particle model introduced in the next section.

6. Wavicles

Just  as  this  theory  involves  a  nonstandard  interpretation  of  relativity,  an  alternate
interpretation of quantum mechanics is also involved.  As we'll see below, in the context of
this wave system, this permits a new, realistic model of elementary particles.

In the usual textbook interpretation, de Broglie waves are taken to be linear waves of pure
probability, whose squared moduli determine the likelihood of finding particles in particular
states.  These nonphysical waves propagate through increasing volumes of space (at speeds
greater than light) until instantaneously "reduced" by a measurement.  In the times between
measurements, particles are taken not to exist in any definite state.

21

However, as discussed by Bell
, what constitutes a "measurement" has never been clearly
defined.  Despite its widespread acceptance and its usefulness as a calculational tool, the
standard interpretation of quantum mechanics brings severe conceptual difficulties.  This has
also been pointed out by de Broglie , Schrödinger , Einstein , and Dirac  -- each an architect
of the existing quantum theory.

23  

22  

1  

24

 

A second, distinctly different interpretation of quantum mechanics exists, which is equally
consistent  with  experiment.    (At  least  in  the  nonrelativistic  case.)    This  is  the  "hidden"
variables theory of de Broglie, Bohm, and Vigier.  Here, de Broglie waves are taken to be real,
nonlinear ones, and particles have definite states in the times between measurements.*  In
such a theory, Heisenberg uncertainty derives from inherent limitations in the measurement
process.  The present theory can be considered a relativistic extension of this one.

2

Until Bohm's paper of 1952 , it was generally held that a self-consistent hidden variables
theory was impossible.  A frequently cited proof to this effect had been published by von
Neumann in 1932.  (Although a serious flaw in von Neumann's proof was pointed out by
Grete Hermann in 1935, her finding went largely unnoticed at the time.)  Bohm refuted this
idea by actually constructing a self-consistent theory of this type.  As Bell put it later, "in
1952, I saw the impossible done".26

Bell's Theorem was developed in response to Bohm's work, to define the requirements for
a valid hidden variables theory.  It indicates that, in any self-consistent theory of quantum
mechanics, there are necessarily non-local effects, as there are in Bohm's.  While Bell was a
proponent of hidden variables, their required non-local character has been taken by some as
evidence  against  their  existence.    However,  it  will  be  shown  that  similar  non-local
phenomena can be found in ordinary macroscopic systems.  So, while the present theory will
be seen to involve particle-like entities, existing more-or-less continuously in definite states,
this is not in conflict with the usual laws of quantum mechanics.

*Albert, Aharanov and D'Amato  have also given strong theoretical evidence that particles
must have definite states between measurements.

25

65

As mentioned, here elementary particles and their fields are based on self-organizing wave
patterns.  What types of patterns might be expected to form within this repetitive, nonlinear
system?    In  the  absence  of  computer  simulation,  we'll  take  as  a  guide  the  behavior  of
nonlinear, three-dimensional acoustic waves in ultrasonic wave tanks.

A characteristic effect arising in ultrasonic tanks is acoustic cavitation.  This involves the
formation  of  microscopic  bubbles,  which  expand  and  collapse  with  impinging  waves.*
While bubbles are easily formed when the liquid contains dissolved gasses, these also arise
in purified, degassed  liquids.  Here they consist of a vapor or other form of the primary
liquid.  In clouds of such bubbles, individual ones can exhibit surprising persistence.  A
variety of theories have been proposed to explain this, many involving assumed impurities
in the liquid.28

Usually ignored in such theories is the self-organizational capacity of strongly nonlinear
wave systems.  While waves determine where the bubbles are**, the latter also influence the
propagation  of  waves  (directly  by  reflection  and  also  indirectly  through  the  nonlinear
interaction of reflected and other waves).  So it may be that these pulsating bubbles are
sustained by feedback, where waves are directed toward the bubble sites.  We'll assume that
this is so.  (This would also help explain the large wave amplifications observed.)  Bubbles
then occupy the centers of more-or-less spherical standing wave patterns, with amplitudes
varying as the reciprocal square of the distance to the bubble center.

Could similar patterns arise in our 4-D wave system?  The simplest 4-D analogy would
involve hyperspherical waves.  However, in this repetitive system, isolated hyperspherical
patterns  can't  exist.    Instead,  there  would  necessarily  be  an  overlapping  series  of  these,
repeating in the 
 dimension with the structure interval, s.  At some distance from the x, y,
z center, the fronts of the combined waves would approximate hypercylinders, aligned with
the 
 axis.  Like 3-D spherical ones, the average amplitudes for such waves would vary as
1
2
1/r , where the radius, r, parallels the reference space.  (For isolated hyperspherical waves,
it would be 1/r .)3

1

Notice that, while we are constrained to repeating waveforms, our four-dimensional system
still  has  another  degree  of  freedom  not  found  in  a  three-dimensional  one.    Besides
hypercylindrical  patterns,  hyperconical  ones  of  various  shapes  are  also  permitted.    (The
former are a special case of these.)  Fig. 6-1 depicts sections of several hyperconical fronts

*A remarkable aspect is the extreme concentration of wave energy occurring during bubble
collapse.  In water, this can cause a bluish or violet light emission called sonoluminescence.
Energy gains of over 10  have been reported.  The energies attained are so great that, for
bubbles containing a deuterium/tritium mixture, measurable thermonuclear fusion may be
possible.27

12

**This is demonstrated clearly in single-bubble sonoluminescence experiments, where the
bubble's position is governed by focussed waves, overriding its gravitational tendency to
rise.29

Within a central "core" region, where the amplitudes are great, we'll consider these hypercon-
ical waves to be nonlinear.  Consequently, they are reflected and/or transmitted through this
region with phase shifts.  For simplicity, here we'll take it that the reflection is total and
abrupt, as shown in Fig. 6-2.  As indicated by arrows, the cone in (a) represents an incident
wavefront, while the thin cylinder at the center indicates the nonlinear core.  The front's pro-
gressive reflection is depicted in (a)-(d), such that in (d) the wavefront is entirely reflected.

Assuming that the waves in these patterns are flow waves, then, from the last section, for
every  wave  of  positive  relative  density  we  can  also  expect  a  balancing  negative  one.
Combined in the same pattern, this would give four wave sets all together, as illustrated in
Fig.  6-3.    While  (a)  represents  an  incident  wave  of  positive  density,  (b)  represents  a
corresponding wave of like density after reflection.  Both move positively with respect to

same core region.

whose flow increases towards the core.  Inverted patterns, with opposite 
 flows (charges),
are also permitted.

 flows, corresponding to the

A key assumption in this theory is that, while the system is driven to form such patterns, the
 flow attainable at the cores has a sharp limit.  This limiting velocity is regarded as a general
1
characteristic  of the wave system, like the characteristic wave velocity, c.  With positive
feedback acting to increase the core flow, this limit then becomes the defining nonlinear
element of these patterns, setting the flow wave amplitudes.

1

Attributing electromagnetic potentials to 
 flows, as described earlier, we then have particle-
like entities with quantized charge, energy (mass), and proper Coulomb fields.  Also, particle
"spin" can be attributed to an extra degree of freedom of these 4-D these standing wave
patterns.  In an introduction to quantum electrodynamics, Richard Feynman remarked that,
since they also behave as waves, elementary particles could just as well be referred to as
"wavicles.
  Here we'll adopt Feynman's term as the name for these hyperconical flow wave
#
patterns, which form the basis for charged particles in this theory.

(The  axially  symmetric  configuration  of  Figs.  6-1  to  6-3  only  characterizes  a  stationary
wavicle.  As described below, at relativistic speeds, the hyperconical fronts are tipped with
respect  to  the  core,  and  open  out.    Also,  in  an  actual  wavicle,  the  wavefronts  would  be
somewhat irregular, unlike the perfectly symmetrical hypercones depicted.)

68

Of course wavicles depend on incoming waves, originating in remote parts of the system,
for  their  continued  existence.    Thus,  unlike  the  usual  conception  of  a  particle,  they  can't  be
considered to exist independently of their surrounding environment.  The source of a wavicle's
incoming waves is taken to be others in the system.  Likewise, its outgoing waves are also
incoming ones for those.  (Like the reflecting waves in a large cloud of cavitation bubbles.)
Consequently, the waves comprising a wavicle are not exclusively its own.  (This is manifested in
the inseparability of particles and observing apparatus in quantum-mechanical experiments.)

For a conventional charged particle to have finite size, additional "Poincaré stresses" must
be introduced to hold it together against the effects of its own field.
  (Finite size avoids the
serious problem of an infinite field at the particle's location.)  One immediate advantage of
wavicles is that no Poincaré stresses are called for, since these are contained naturally by the
inward momentum of their incoming waves.  (The wavicle model also seems to answer the
long-standing problem of the basis of radiative reaction in charged particles.  This calls for
"half-advanced" and "half-retarded" waves, where the former anticipate the future particle
position. )31

30

Moiré Wavefronts

Another premise of this theory is that certain wavicle patterns are more stable than others.
These have characteristic wave angles and frequencies, in the stationary case, and correspond
to different elementary particles or sub-particles.  As proposed by de Broglie, we'll take the
frequency and mass to be proportional, via the Planck and Einstein relations

Given  a  stationary  wavicle,  a  moving  one  is  obtained  by  applying  our  usual  relativistic
transformation, shown to hold for this system.  (The defining conditions for a wavicle are
taken  to  transform  along  with  its  waves.)    While  the  component  waves  have  a  single
frequency  in  the  rest  case,  this  is  no  longer  true  when  a  wavicle  moves.    However,  in
combination, they comprise "Moiré wavefronts,
 which still have a single frequency.  Here
#
we'll find that such wavefronts correspond, in more than one way, to the de Broglie waves
of particles with various rest masses.

Fig. 6-4 illustrates a cross-section of a stationary wavicle in two dimensions, showing only
positive density waves.  The two crisscrossing sets, marked by thin lines, are the same waves,
before and after reflection from the core.  (The core is shown as the vertical gap at the center.)
In this cross-section, these waves have just two orientations, with incident and reflected
waves on opposite sides of the core sharing the same angle.  As denoted by vectors with
magnitude  c,  the  waves  of  both  orientations  are  moving  positively  with  respect  to

pattern's nodes is indicated on the right by the vector, N.

(The vertical segment s is an added construct.)  Distance d/2 is Lorentz
contracted.

70

A striking feature of any standing wave pattern is that, regardless of its size, all regions undergo
synchronized behavior.  As seen in the reference space, the extended wave field of a stationary
wavicle undulates or pulsates in unison, at a specific frequency.  This corresponds to the 
1
movements of the component wave patterns through the reference space.  It’s these pattern
movements that we'll be describing in terms of Moiré wavefronts.
 
If the positive component waves of Fig. 6-4 were drawn with thick lines, from the Moiré
effect, you might see alternating light and dark bands, running horizontally across the nodes.
Moiré wavefronts, depicted here by gray bars, have the same orientation; hence the term.
Representing phases of the overall wave pattern, Moiré wavefronts are defined as having the same 
1
period, s.  (This omits half the lines which would be perceived visually with a Moiré pattern.)
Thus, in the reference space, their frequency represents that of a wavicle's pulsations.

For a stationary wavicle, the component wave and Moiré frequencies are all identical.  As
before, we'll characterize the component waves in terms of associated pro-particle velocities.
(Knowing the relativistic transformation equations for pro-particles, we can then use these
to describe the transformation of wavicles.)  Working in just the x and 
 dimensions of Fig.
6-4,  with  representative  positive  density  waves  of  just  two  orientations,  we'll  call  the
characteristic pro-particle velocities u ' and u '.  So we have

Fig 6-5 depicts the same wavicle, moving at a relativistic speed, v.  In addition to the core,
the  pattern  nodes  must  also  have  this  x  velocity.    (Since  the  component  wavefronts  are
parallel within each set and meet at nodes at the core surface.)  Again, the component waves
have just two orientations, with incident and reflected waves on opposite sides of the core
matching in angle.  As shown, the Moiré wavefronts are tilted in this case.

For  a  moving  wavicle,  at  a  position  traveling  with  it,  we  know  the  frequencies  of  both
component wave sets are decreased by simple relativistic time dilation.  (This can also be
shown formally from the transformation equations.)  At such a position (the core, for example)

 offsets.  Nevertheless, from its greater
 velocity, a Moiré front still arrives at the reference space at the proper relativistic time.)

Next, in terms of its node spacing, we'll describe the contraction of a moving wavicle, having
velocity v in the x dimension.  We'll call the x distance between successive nodes on the same
Moiré wavefront d.  Referring to Fig. 6-5(b) again, from the node where wavefronts a and b
cross, to the segment, s, (of this 
 length) the distance is d/2.  From the figure, this distance,
the slopes of a and b, and s are related by

For d, we have

The component wave slopes are related to their characteristic pro-particle velocities by

(See Fig. 2-3, for example.)  To describe a stationary wavicle, we'll insert the pro-particle
velocities of Eq. (6-2) into this expression.  Then putting these slopes into Eq. (6-17), we get

(Here  I'd  like  to  mention  another  difference  between  the  transformations  of  component
waves and Moiré wavefronts.  Recall that, as the former are tilted in four dimensions, the
spacing between associated pro-particles is invariant.  However, because comparable Moiré
fronts undergo greater tilts, the 4-D spacing of the associated nodes increases with tilt.  In
terms  of  the  reference  space,  though,  the  node  spacings  undergo  the  same  relativistic
contraction as pro-particles.)

v  in  the  +x  direction.    Part  (a)  illustrates  the  configuration  in

remaining dimensions.  As shown, the hyperconical axes remain parallel to the node velocity
 axis.  Part (b) depicts the
vector, N, which is tipped here with respect to the core and 
relationship between N, v, and vector V , which is the 
 phase velocity of a Moiré wavefront
 motion of a node at
at an x position moving with velocity v.  (For example, consider the 
the moving core surface.)  From v and V , we can find N.

(In  analyzing  this  system,  a  possible  source  of  confusion  is  the  fact  that  the  4-D  Moiré
wavefront velocity is somewhat less than N.  This results from the fact that, in a moving

In contrast to the component waves, which remain hyperconical, Moiré wavefronts are essentially

The basic shape difference between component and Moiré wavefronts is a crucial one.  Since
the Moiré fronts of a uniformly moving wavicle are hyperplanar, these appear as infinite plane waves
in the reference space, exactly like the de Broglie waves of a uniformly moving particle.  It follows that,
knowing only the spatial arrangement of its Moiré wavefronts, one can infer the momentum of  such
a wavicle, but not its position.

Flow Wave Effects and the Wavicle Core

2

As described, a stationary wavicle has a flow wave pattern with an amplitude and average
 flow varying as 1/r .  Since the wave pattern of a moving wavicle contracts relativistically,
1
its  flow  pattern  must  do  this  also.    In  addition,  its  average  (fixed-position)  flow  wave
frequency increases relativistically.  Given that a wavicle's 
 flow is proportional to both
  flow  is  then  conserved.    This  matches  the
wave  amplitude  and  frequency,  total 
conservation of charge in an actual particle, where contracted (ellipsoidal) equi-potential
surfaces enclose increased potentials. 

1

1

For a wavicle in an external 
 flow (corresponding to a charged particle in a potential), its
wave pattern can be expected to move with the effective 
 flow, as described previously for
pro-particles.  As depicted in Fig. 6-3, we have component waves of both relative densities,
.  Consequently, half are augmented in frequency,
moving in oppositely with respect to 
while the other half are decreased by an equal amount.  This gives an average frequency and
associated

for an actual particle in an external potential.  Thus we have a complete model of a relativistic,
quantized charge.

1

1

1

Again, for a given wavicle pattern having a specific rest frequency, an inverted pattern with
 flow is also possible.  As you might expect, the two cases are taken to represent
an opposite 
corresponding particles and antiparticles.  Of course wavicles with positive 
 flows are the ones
we'll choose to equate with positively charged particles.

1

1

In the simplified wavefront diagrams above, we've assumed that a wavicle's components
move at a constant velocity, c, and thus can retain a hyperconical shape.  Clearly this is
reasonable at large distances from the core, where the amplitudes and nonlinear effects are
vanishing.  What happens in the region close to the core (this may be relatively small), where
the flow wave amplitudes are great?  Here the picture is less clear.

77

For individual component waves taken in isolation, it may be that their speed would vary
with amplitude.  (Like familiar shock waves, the waves with greater density might move
faster.)  Taken together, we also expect a wavicle's components to simultaneously reflect,
refract, and displace one another.  In a balanced system, where the overall density remains
constant, some of these nonlinear effects may tend to cancel.  So it's conceivable that the
effective component wave velocities might remain approximately c near the core.

(This would imply that the flow wave interactions within wavicles differ from those between
wavicles.  Similar behavior is observed in solitons, where the component wave interactions
differ from those of whole solitons.)

Whatever transpires near the wavicle center, it's required that, after leaving this region, the
various outgoing component waves should be the reflected equivalent of those incoming.

(This is necessary to conserve 
to be self-organizing, there should also be feedback in the core region, actively adjusting the waves to
fit  this  pattern.    It's  hoped  that  such  behavior  can  be  verified  by  modeling  wavicles
numerically.  

1

And  the  core?    The  example  of  acoustic  cavitation  suggests  the  possibility  of  a  distinct
surface, representing a sharp discontinuity in the properties of the wave medium outside and
inside the core.  (To simulate such a wavicle numerically, it would be necessary to model a
separate set of conditions existing inside the core.)  With an overall alignment paralleling the
 axis, the surface conceivably might be a tubular one, rippled by impinging waves.  Or, it

1
could consist of separate bubbles, in a periodic string with the same orientation.

To describe the possible interactions of wavicles, we can begin by considering the responses
of individual wavicles to external 
 flows.  Along the lines of our earlier work with pro-
particles, we can approach this from the standpoint of an individual wavicle encountering

be attributed to other wavicles.  So in this case, the external flow wave pattern is necessarily

Earlier, we saw that the component waves in this system are simultaneously reflected and
transmitted at a sharp 
 flow interface.  However, for a wavicle to persist, the overall system
must  "decide"  whether  the  whole  entity  is  to  be  transmitted  or  reflected.    The  system's
behavior must be such that, after the wavicle's motion changes, waves originating from prior
times continue to arrive at its future core position.  To conserve the total momentum of the
system, other wavicles necessarily undergo opposing changes of motion.  And these also
must continue to receive incoming waves.

78

8

Similar behavior is found in other nonlinear wave systems, such as that of Zabusky and
Kruskal,  cited in Section 1.  Each of its various solitons can be viewed as a collection of
Fourier component waves, shared with the others in the system.  As the solitons interact and
their individual velocities change, all the various components are observed to change with
them, accordingly.  Thus each hump retains its due share of component waves and persists
indefinitely.  (Since they interact and pass through one another "without losing their form
or identity," wavicles could possibly be classified as solitons.  However, the term normally
refers to running waves, rather than standing wave patterns.)

From our earlier pro-particle work, a free wavicle's velocity can be expected to change if it
enters a different 
 flow.  Also, we’ve seen that the wave pattern depends on its velocity.  So
as the wavicle core crosses the interface, its pattern must change -- initially for the impinging
waves close to the core.  This presumably occurs via a nonlinear wave interaction -- one
which simultaneously alters the patterns of other wavicles in the system.  The region of
nonlinear interaction should then expand outward.

1

In this theory, such propagating disturbances in the patterns of wavicles represent electromagnetic
waves.    (Here  electromagnetic  waves  alone  can't  exist.    In  "empty"  space,  they  represent
disturbances in the wave fields of distant matter.)

As described, the Moiré waves of wavicles are taken to correspond to de Broglie waves.
Note that a wavicle has two sets of Moiré waves -- one associated with its positive density
components, and another with those of negative relative density.  The wavelengths of the
two sets in the reference space are always identical.  However, in external 
 flows their
frequencies differ.

Thus, if wavicles are to behave like actual particles, it's their positive density Moiré waves
which must correspond to de Broglie waves.  For example, if a wavicle enters a stationary
 flow region, its velocity should change such that the positive Moiré frequency is conserved.
1
It may be difficult to show directly that wavicles act this way.  However, it's reasonable that
 flow of the system are conserved if
they would, since the total energy, momentum and 
they do.  Again, it may be possible to verify this through computer simulation.

79

Given that our system behaves this way, we have entities which both generate and respond
to  potentials  as  actual  particles  do.    And,  based  on  different  characteristic  wave  angles,
particles of different masses can be modeled.  Tentatively, we'll take individual wavicles to
represent the charged leptons: the electron, muon, tauon and their antiparticles.  Since there
is no evidence of internal structure in these, single wavicles with small cores may be an
accurate representation.  Again, this avoids the problem of infinite fields encountered in
standard field theory,* where these particles are treated as point charges.

*To this end, a very similar model of electrons and muons was proposed by Dirac in 1962.32
In it, the electron is viewed as "a bubble in the electromagnetic field", of finite size.  The
muon is then taken to be an excited state of the electron, involving radial pulsations of the
bubble and a spherically symmetrical wave field.

7. Future Additions

Several additional sections of this paper are planned, but incomplete at this point.  Here I'd
like to try to give some sense of what these are about and to introduce some of the key ideas.
(At my usual glacial pace, it will be some time before the remaining sections are written.  So
it seems best to go ahead, publish this much, and finish later!)  Also, the concluding section,
which follows this one, is more-or-less complete.

Quantum Mechanics

One  added  section  will  address  quantum  mechanics,  with  particular  attention  to  the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, or EPR, effect.  The starting point is the observation that, for a
wavicle to persist, even its simplest behaviors require the coordinated action of the overall
wave system.  Thus a wavicle's actions are necessarily determined by non-local factors.  Such
non-locality is also characteristic of the EPR effect.

33

It's sometimes said that each part of a nonlinear wave system "knows" what the other parts
are doing.  The quasicrystalline wave structures mentioned in Section 1 are a clear example.
(As Penrose  points out, the formation of a quasicrystalline patterns requires knowledge of
remote parts of a system.)  Connected, non-local wave phenomena of this sort can be seen
as  the  result  of  nonlinear  coupling.    (Like  that  of  nonlinearly  coupled  pendulums  or
oscillators.)  Such coupling is expected with the pulsations of wavicles, and is taken as the
basis for quantized de Broglie wavelengths, such as those of electrons in atoms.

Again, the present work is related to Bohm's "hidden variables" theory,  where particles exist
continuously in definite states and follow definite trajectories.  In it, de Broglie waves and
particles  are  influenced  by  an  additional  "quantum-mechanical"  potential  or  "quantum
potential,
  which  has  a  non-local  aspect.    Bohm's  theory  is  based  on  the  non-relativistic

He then showed that, if the quantum potential were to fluctuate randomly, such particles
would behave exactly in accordance with the usual statistical laws of quantum mechanics --
despite  following  well-defined  trajectories.    (Striking  computer-modeled  trajectories  of
3
particles in quantum potentials can be found in Philippidis et al.
 or Vigier et al. )  Bohm and
Vigier  subsequently proposed random fluctuations in a fluid wave medium as a physical
basis for the quantum potential.

34

35

Toward a relativistic theory, Vigier  has since proposed a "sub-quantum Dirac ether" as the
fluid  medium.    Unlike  real  fluids,  the  elements  of  a  Dirac  ether  have  no  specific  states.
(Dirac   describes  it  as  analogous  to  the  concept  of  particle  clouds,  where  particles  lack
definite states.)  "Manifest" relativistic covariance then is permitted by the fact that there is
no overall state of motion.  However, this is inconsistent with the basic de Broglie/Bohm
theory, where particles have definite states and the wave medium is taken to be physically
real.  On the other hand, the present theory offers an appropriate medium which is both
relativistic and realistic.

At  this point, we'll introduce another feature of wavicles.  In the previous section, their
wavefronts were illustrated as perfectly symmetrical hypercones, for simplicity.  However,
in a realistic case, where the source of a wavicle's incident waves is others, the patterns are
necessarily irregular to some degree.  (There is no way to generate perfectly symmetrical
hyperconical wavefronts from sources at discrete, scattered sites.)  While feedback maintains
a wavicle's average 
 flow, such asymmetries would result in intermittent fluctuations in the
 flow fluctuations of this nature

 flow seen at the core, and changes in its motion.  Chaotic

are taken to correspond to Bohm's quantum potential.

Gravitation and Cosmology

In Einstein's version of general relativity, gravitation is based on a varying non-Euclidean
space-time, and an absolute speed of light.  In this theory, gravity is associated with local
variations in the speed of light, while space and time (in a preferred frame) are absolutes.
For very strong gravitational fields, or large astronomical distances, the two theories make
very different, testable predictions.

Like  the  electromagnetic  forces,  the  source  of  gravitation  here  lies  in  the  wave  fields  of
wavicles.  In concentrations of matter containing oppositely charged wavicles, the average
 flows tend to cancel at large distances, like the electric fields of conventional particles.
1
However, the underlying wave fields do not cancel.  The cumulative waves fluctuate more-or-
less randomly, with an rms amplitude varying approximately as 1/r  from the center of
mass, like the wave fields of individual wavicles.  The resulting irregular fluctuations of the
wave medium are taken to represent gravitational potentials.  (Thus these and the quantum
potential are related.)

2

The key to gravitation in this system is the dependance of the rate of physical processes on
the 4-D wave speed, c.  Our wave-based gravitational potentials act by reducing this general
velocity.  (This may be attributable to disruption of rectilinear wave propagation by the
medium's fluctuations.  For example, a ray traveling from point a to point b experiences
small-scale excursions which increase the total path length, effectively decreasing the wave
velocity.)    As  c  is  reduced,  everything  is  slowed  proportionately  --  the  movements  of
wavicles, the propagation of electromagnetic waves, etc.

Clocks in gravitational potentials are perceived by outside observers to be slowed, as usual.
Light is also bent in a gravitational field.  In this case, though, the effect corresponds to
ordinary refraction.  (Of course refractive index goes as the inverse of wave speed.)  As a
result,  the  local  behavior  of  physical  systems  in  gravitational  fields  matches  that  in
accelerating frames -- i.e., Einstein's principle of equivalence is met.

For comparing Einstein's account of gravity with this one, the concept of optical path length
is useful.  Often used in evaluating optical systems, this is computed by multiplying the
lengths of light rays in optical elements by the refractive indices there.  While treated as
distances, these products are actually a measure of the time required for a wavefront to
transit an element.  (In an ideal imaging system, the summed optical path lengths between
corresponding object and image points are the same for all rays.  This says that all parts of
a wavefront arrive at an image point simultaneously -- in phase.)  Still, in terms of light
wavelengths, a material with an index above one behaves as though additional space is
compressed inside it.

83

Einstein assumes that optical path lengths in gravitational potentials are the same as spatial
distance.    Here,  as  in  ordinary  optical  systems,  they  aren't.    As  a  result,  different
arrangements of things in space are predicted.  For weak gravitational fields and modest
astronomical distances, like those within the solar system, the differences are minute.  At
cosmological scales, however, these should be apparent.

Because c isn't sacrosanct in this theory, an alternate basis for the Hubble redshift is also
permitted.  Here, c is taken to be gradually increasing.  Since this corresponds to the rate of
all processes (at the macroscopic level), at the time of emission, the spectra of remote galaxies
would have been lower in frequency than present ones.  So we're again invoking a varying
wave speed, instead of a varying space-time.

To provide for a changing c, we'll take the wave medium, stuff, to resemble a real gas, with
particle-like constituents.  The characteristic acoustic wave velocity then depends on the
effective temperature and density.  We can also suppose that the constituents of stuff are also
wave-based entities (like tiny wavicles), associated with some finer coherent structure.  If
energy is gradually transferred between wave structures at different scales, we then have a
mechanism for changes in these qualities of stuff at the macroscopic level.

(Stuff is assumed to have a fractal-like nature, with wave structures arising and subsiding
at widely differing scales.  In this respect there's a resemblance to "inflationary" cosmological
models.)

Such energy transfers occur naturally in nonlinear wave systems.  Not only from large waves
to  small,  but  also  in  the  opposite  direction.*    An  important  example  was  discovered  in
computer-modeled waves by Fermi, Pasta and Ulam in the 1950's.
  Prior to their work, it
was widely believed that nonlinearity in waves inevitably leads to thermodynamic behavior,
where  orderly  large-scale  waves  degenerate  into  random  small-scale  ones.    The  system
studied was one-dimensional, with a discrete length.  Initially, a large sinusoidal wave was
seen  to  transform  into  various  configurations  of  smaller  ones.    However,  the  process
eventually reversed, with the small waves coalescing back into the starting waveform.  (The
effect is now called FPU recurrence.  Fermi, Pasta, and Ulam also inspired the computer
experiments of Zabusky and Kruskal, discussed earlier.)

10

It seems clear that general qualities of the universe do undergo long-term changes.  In the
course  of  stellar  evolution,  a  substantial  fraction  of  the  collective  mass  in  stars  is  being
converted to neutrinos.  However, the bulk of these are undetected and unaccounted for.  It's
conceivable that much of the lost energy is transferred to a smaller-scale wave structure,
helping raise the effective "temperature" of stuff at that level, and the value of c.

*Large ocean waves are now thought to grow from smaller ones overtaken.7

84

According to Einstein's general relativity and the standard Big Bang model, a curved, finite,
expanding space-time is the basis of the Hubble redshift.  On the other hand, the repeating
wave system in this theory requires a Euclidean space.  Since different topologies are predicted,
the two theories can be tested by determining the structure of space.  Of course any direct
observation of space-time curvature (including entities such as wormholes) would invalidate
the new theory.

The large-scale curvature of space can be estimated (at least to an order of magnitude) by
counting  galaxies  within  different  radii  from  our  position.    In  a  flat  space,  the  numbers
would increase approximately as the cube of the radius, while a curved space-time should
deviate from this.  Studies of this kind, for example by Loh and Spillar , have indicated that
space is either flat, or very close to it.  According to Linde , the discrepancy between the
observed curvature and that predicted by Einstein's general relativity and the standard Big
Bang model is roughly sixty orders of magnitude.  This extreme disagreement is called the
"flatness problem.
#

37

36

While the present theory predicts flatness, it may seem trivial, since a Euclidean space was
assumed at the outset.*  However, note that this assumption is an essential element of the
basic theory, and not something added to fit certain astronomical data.  In comparison, the
assumptions regarding space are much more complex in Einstein's theory.  There space is
Minkowskian, also curved by the presence of matter, and possibly further reshaped by an
additional  cosmological  constant.**    Of  course  the  overriding  point  is  that,  unlike  the
standard Big Bang model, here space-time curvature is not required.

Recent observations pertaining to the age of the universe also appear to contradict the Big
Bang.  Attributing the redshifts of remote galaxies to recessional velocities, the predicted age
can be obtained by dividing the distances of galaxies by their apparent velocities.  Using the
 have
Hubble Space Telescope to estimate the distance of the galaxy M100, Freedman et al.
put the universe's age at approximately 8 billion years -- less than the estimated age of its
oldest stars.

38

The discovery of highly-developed large-scale structures, such as the Great Wall and Great
Attractor, also argues for an older universe than that allowed by the standard Big Bang
model.  In this theory, the age of the universe isn't similarly constrained, since the Hubble
redshift is not attributed to an expanding universe.  Ancient stars are permitted, and mature
large-scale structures are expected.

*Poincaré argued that the true geometry of the universe must be Euclidean.

**The cosmological constant, 
, from Einstein's early gravitational field equations, has been
proposed  as  a  means  of  dealing  with  the  flatness  problem.    Still,  even  with  the  re-
introduction of this extra, arbitrary quantity, a sufficiently flat space appears unattainable
within the constraints of standard Big Bang cosmology.37

Nuclear Forces and Sub-particles

This part of the theory is more tentative; at this point it's only qualitative.

Presently, nuclear forces are taken to be relatives of the Casimir effect.  The latter involves
vacuum fluctuations (random electromagnetic waves occurring in "empty" space) which are
suppressed in regions between parallel conducting plates.  As a result, waves are reflected
disproportionately from the outside plate surfaces, creating a small pressure driving the
plates together.  The force varies as the inverse of the plate spacing, to the fourth power.

Due to their finite sizes, similar effects may arise between reflecting wavicle cores.  Although
these are not flat plates, in close proximity, they would shield one another somewhat from
incident component waves.  Also, since the component wave amplitudes are extreme near
the cores, a large attractive force could arise at short distances.  This effect, which depends
in  part on the wavicle core sizes and the characteristic hyperconical wave angles, is the
assumed basis of nuclear forces.  (The feedback which sustains the individual wave patterns
is also taken to oppose the complete merging of wavicles.)

Since multiple nonlinear effects are involved, it appears difficult to test this idea by analytical
methods.  However, it may be possible to verify it through computer simulation of the wave
system.  (A possibly related effect is seen in ultrasonic wave tanks, where the cavitating fluid
contains  particulate  impurities.    The  wave  action  tends  to  drive  these  together,  forming
aggregates  which  precipitate  out.    The  process  is  sometimes  used  to  purify  fluids.
Suspended particles of metal powder can be driven together so forcefully that they partially
melt and fuse. )39

Besides constituting nuclei, bound groupings of wavicles may also be needed to account for
the internal structure of hadrons.  If so, the binding forces might be similar to those of nuclei.
In the prevailing quark model, the constituents of hadrons have fractional charges.  On the
other hand, in the current version of this theory, uniform (or nearly uniform) elementary
charges are called for.  A compromise might be to assume that both hadrons and leptons
have  constituents  with  charges  of    ±
e.    A  model  of  this  nature  has  been  proposed  by
Harari

, for example.

D

40

Still, fractional charges have never been observed directly.  Also, the prevailing quark model
is contradicted by recent measurements of the proton's spin magnetic moment, which give
41
only  about  one  third  the  predicted  value.
)    Since  charge  and  spin
#
magnetic moment are related, one wonders whether this might indicate that hadrons actually
have constituents with integral charges.  As described by Nambu and Han , various models
based on quark-like sub-particles with integral charges have been suggested in the past.

    (The  "spin  crisis.

Computer Modeling

Again, some wave behaviors required by this theory are difficult to verify analytically.  (The
evolution of nonlinear waves in a gas-like medium can be viewed as an extreme example of
the many-body problem -- with each particulate constituent a separate body.)  However, it
may be possible to do this though computer modeling.  (No modeling has been attempted
at this point.)  Some basic questions to be answered are:

1.)  Can  a  wave  system  of  this  kind  remain  balanced?    (Complimentary
positive and negative density flow waves, balanced such that net flows only
arise in the 

 dimension.)

1

 flow
2.) To arrive at the vector potential, we assumed that the effective 
experienced by pro-particles at their moving positions is proportional to the
frequency of flow waves encountered.  Does this hold?

1

3.) Are self-organizing flow wave patterns resembling wavicles observed?

4.) Do these exhibit quantum-mechanical behaviors?

As discussed in Section 1, the computer experiments of Zabusky and Kruskal modeled an
infinite one-dimensional system of nonlinear waves.  Because these were periodic, it was
only necessary to model a single region equal in length to the period.  Waves were wrapped
 dimension, we can
around from one edge of the region to the other.  With respect to the 
do the same for the periodic waves of this system.

 dimension, a relatively
While only a single layer of the system needs representation in the 
broad region needs to be covered in x, y, and z.  A simple choice of region to model would
be a thin, rectangular hyperbox, illustrated in three dimensions in Fig. 7-1.  The box height,
s, is the 

 period of the wave structure.

1

87

Waves at the top and bottom of the hyperbox would wrap around.  To prevent waves from
escaping, the sides could be treated as mirrors.  Of course standing waves in a cavity are
strongly influenced its shape.  (A contained wavicle might be seen to behave like a quantum-
mechanical particle in a box.)  A hyperbox with an irregular footprint in the reference space
might give a better approximation of waves evolving in an infinite space.

Another possible way to maintain the waves would be to also wrap them from side wall to
opposite side wall, instead of reflecting them.  Further strategies could be used to reduce the
regularity of the "cavity.
  For example, different sections of a given side could be wrapped
#
to sections of various other sides.  Instead of wrapping directly across, opposite sides could
be  wrapped  with  a  twist.    Wrapping  and  reflection  could  be  combined.    (Reflection  is
essentially wrapping a side to itself.)  Etc . . . 

The medium, stuff, could be represented either as a continuous fluid, or one with discrete,
particle-like constituents.  For a realistic simulation in four dimensions, the required number
of particles or fluid elements is huge -- almost certainly more than 10 .  (Enough to challenge
a massively parallel supercomputer. )   Modeling an analogous three-dimensional system
would cut the computational demands greatly.

43

11

Something similar to wavicles, with conical rather than hyperconical wavefronts, might arise
in 3-D systems.  However, if such patterns occur, their associated 
 flows would vary as 1/r,
rather than 1/r , giving them very different dynamical properties.  Because wavicles depend
for their existence on interactions with others, lacking the same dynamics, their analogues
may not form.  Even so, basic questions about the behavior of 4-D wave systems should still
be answerable from three-dimensional experiments.  (For example, questions 1 and 2 above.)

1

2

Probably the biggest obstacle to constructing an accurate model is the fact that the specific
characteristics of stuff are unknown at this point.  Like real fluids, the behavior of stuff may
change abruptly at critical points.  From the example of ultrasonic cavitation bubbles in pure
water,  stuff  inside  a  wavicle  core  may  have  sharply  different  properties.*    A  possible
approach to modeling wavicle formation would be to take an arbitrary set of balanced flow
waves, and "seed" it with hyperbubbles, aligned with the 
 axis.  (The stuff inside these
could be assigned a much higher wave velocity, for example.)  Waves might nucleate around
these, forming wavicle-type patterns, with hyperbubbles as cores.

1

Zabusky and Kruskal's modeling of a one-dimensional, repeating wave system was very
illuminating.  In higher-dimensioned systems like this one, it seems likely that richer forms
of self-organization will be found.  Whatever the wave behaviors may be, it’s certain they'll
be interesting.

*Even knowing something of the properties of normal water, we don't yet have a good model
for the waves surrounding acoustic cavitation bubbles.

88

8. The Course of Physics

All of modern physics is built on Einstein's interpretation of special relativity.  Included is
his view that, a priori, systems with preferred frames, like Lorentz's, must be ruled out.  (In
contrast,  Lorentz  was  willing  to  concede  the  possible  validity  of  Einstein's  space-time
approach.)  In the early years, this exclusionary position was criticized by leading theorists.
Sommerfeld, for example, called it "unhealthy dogmatism.
  However, after the apparent
#
confirmation  of  Einstein's  general  relativity,  his  views  were  adopted  by  the  physics
community at large. 

The various founders of quantum mechanics unanimously took space-time as its framework.
In his stand against the ether, Einstein had argued we should not speak of things that can't
be  measured.    Heisenberg,  Bohr,  and  others  extended  this  philosophy  also  to  quantum
mechanics.  Their Copenhagen interpretation says that, for the same reason, we shouldn't
speak of hidden variables. This viewpoint found its ultimate expression in Bohr's statement
that the quantum mechanical microworld "doesn't exist.

#

As we know, Einstein was dismayed by this, and took a lonely (and courageous) stand in
defense of the principle of causality.  Eventually, a talk with Einstein turned Bohm against
the Copenhagen interpretation, and spurred the development of his hidden variables theory.
Bohm's success also inspired de Broglie to resurrect his related "pilot wave" theory.  Neither
was  endorsed by Einstein, however, who saw a conflict between his own conception of
relativity, and the non-local effects described by Bohm.

Both de Broglie and Bohm were devout believers in Einstein and Minkowski's space-time.
However, Bell has noted that their theory appears to require a preferred frame of reference.
He writes: 

I  think  that conventional formulations of quantum theory, and of quantum field
theory  in  particular,  are  unprofessionally  vague  and  ambiguous.    Professional
physicists ought to be able to do better.  Bohm has shown us a way.  It will be seen
that all the essential results of ordinary quantum field theory are recovered.  But it
will be seen also that the very sharpness of the reformulation brings into focus some
awkward  questions.    The  construction  of  the  scheme  is  not  at  all  unique.    And
Lorentz invariance plays a strange, perhaps incredible role . . . 

...I  am  unable  to  prove,  or  even  formulate  clearly,  the  proposition  that  a  sharp
formulation  of  quantum  field  theory,  such  as  that  set  out  here,  must  disrespect
serious Lorentz invariance.  But it seems to me that this is probably so.  As with
relativity before Einstein, there is then a preferred frame in the formulation of the
theory . . . but it is experimentally indistinguishable.  It seems an eccentric way to
make a world.

 21

Bell further points out the legitimacy of a preferred reference frame in "How to teach special
relativity" , where he advocates the approach of Lorentz and Poincaré.

15

89

In his long search for a unified theory, Einstein followed a belief in the underlying simplicity
  He also looked to
of physical phenomena.  He said "If the answer is simple, God is talking.
#
geometry  as  the  source  of  this  simplicity,  believing  that  natural  phenomena  should  be
describable  in  geometric  terms.    His  early  paper,  "On  the  Electrodynamics  of  Moving
Bodies,
 showed that, in a space-time representation, electric and magnetic fields are exactly
#
the same.  Einstein took this unification as proof of space-time, and an essential step toward
a unified field theory.  Still, space-time geometry has not delivered such a theory.

In accordance with Einstein, it is now generally held that proper mathematical descriptions
of  relativistic  systems  should  be  "manifestly  covariant.
    That  is,  they  should  make  no
#
reference to any sort of preferred frame.  However, even in classical mechanics, this leads to
difficulties.  According to Dirac , we now know that "the Hamiltonian form for the equations
of motion is all important.
  (His italics.)  On this representation of mechanics, Goldstein's
#
graduate text  observes:

44

19

As with the Lagrangian picture in special relativity, two attitudes can be taken to the
Hamiltonian formulation of relativistic mechanics.  The first makes no pretense at a
covariant description but instead works in some specific Lorentz or inertial frame.
Time as measured in the particular Lorentz frame is then not treated on a common
basis  with  other  coordinates  but  serves,  as  in  nonrelativistic  mechanics,  as  a
parameter describing the evolution of the system.  Nonetheless, if the Lagrangian that
leads to the Hamiltonian is itself based on a relativistically invariant physical theory,
e.g.,  Maxwell's  equations  and  the  Lorentz  force,  then  the  resultant  Hamiltonian
picture will be relativistically correct.  The second approach, of course, attempts a
fully  covariant  description  of  the  Hamiltonian  picture,  but  the  difficulties  that
plagued the corresponding Lagrangian approach are even fiercer here.

...there  seems  to  be  a  natural  route  available  for  constructing  a  relativistically
covariant Hamiltonian.  But the route turns out to be mined with booby traps.

Goldstein also shows that the preferred frame method easily gives a concise, non-covariant
Hamiltonian (Eq. (5-16) in this paper).  Applying Einstein's own dictum about the simple
answer, in this case it says that manifest covariance is wrong. 

As mentioned earlier, space-time suffers other drawbacks in comparison with the preferred
frame approach.  One is its inconsistent treatments of linear and rotational motions.  Although
forbidden for linear motion, a preferred frame defined by "the fixed stars" remains for the
rotational case.  So, instead of a single reference frame, there are two very different types.

Again, an egregious shortcoming is that space-time by itself can't account for the direction
of  entropy.    Since  its  time  dimension  must  be  exchangeable  with  its  spatial  ones,  time

90

necessarily has a bidirectional character, with no favored direction.*  Another parameter, like
the unidirectional, independent time of the preferred frame approach, is required.  Thus
Minkowski  space-time  avoids  neither  a  preferred  spatial  frame,  nor  apparently  an
independent time -- this despite its added geometric complexity.

In the present theory, Einstein's space-time view is abandoned.  However, several of his most
basic ideas remain: That the universe is fundamentally simple and describable in terms of
a special geometry.  His requirement of causality.  And the same relativistic principles are
followed -- both Poincaré's principle of relativity, and Einstein's principle of equivalence.
Some other key ideas of this theory are these:

1.) Contrary to the prevailing view, transverse wave phenomena can arise in
continuous  fluid  media.    Where  there  are  nonlinear  wave  structures,
transverse waves of interaction can arise within the waves.  Such waves of
interaction are taken to represent electromagnetic ones.

2.) The unlimited velocity of matter waves is directly explainable on the basis
of a repetitive four-dimensional wave structure.  Its geometry is Euclidean,
and  the  waves  are  redundant  in  one  dimension, 
.    (Consequently,  this
dimension isn't obvious to observers.)  When the wave movement parallels

1

, the apparent 3-D velocity is infinite.

1

3.) The wave medium is an elastic fluid.  Hence its waves are acoustic and
have  a  characteristic  4-D  velocity,  c,  under  standard  conditions.    Moving
wave-based  reflectors,  aligned  with  the 
  axis,  transform  the  waves
relativistically.

1

4.)  The  scalar  potential  can  be  exactly  accounted  for  by  flows  in  the 
dimension, from their refractive and reflective effects on matter waves.

1

5.) These flows are driven by flow waves, balanced such that net flows only
arise  in  the 
  dimension.    This  preserves  the  relativistic  character  of  the
system, and also accounts for the vector potential.

1

6.)  Like  other  nonlinear  waves,  those  of  this  system  are  self-organizing,
forming  additional  patterns,  called  "wavicles,
  within  the  overall  wave
#
structure.  These behave as elementary particles.  Involved are approximately
hyperconical waves, reflected at a central "core" region where the amplitudes
are great.  (Wavicles are also the above wave-based reflectors.)

*It's sometimes argued that this problem can be resolved by assuming that, when the time
dimension of space-time is reversed, entropy is too.  The reversed case would be perceived
as normal by observers, since their thought processes would run backwards also.  However,
since space-time is symmetrical, this still provides no basis for the acknowledged difference
between the forward and reverse cases.

91

 flow pattern
7.) A wavicle's components are flow waves.  The resulting 
corresponds  to  the  electromagnetic  potentials  of  a  charged  particle.
Noninverted and inverted patterns represent corresponding particles and
antiparticles.  Quantized charge and energy result from a characteristic limit
to the 

 flow attainable at the core.  

1

1

8.) Wavicles are inherently non-local phenomena, interdependent on other
wavicles and their reflected waves for their existence.  Their behavior is that
of extended objects, of arbitrary extent.  Like solitons, wavicles move and
interact as wholes.

9.)  The  synchronous  pulsation  of  a  wavicle's  standing  wave  field  can  be
 representing surfaces of equal
characterized in terms of "Moiré wavefronts,
#
phase.    These  correspond  to  de  Broglie  waves,  and  define  the  quantum
mechanical behavior of wavicles.  Nonlinear coupling of the pulsations, both
within and between wavicles, is taken as the underlying mechanism.

1

10.) In concentrations of matter, the average 
 flows of oppositely charged
wavicles  tend  to  cancel  at  large  distances,  like  the  electric  fields  of
conventional  charged  particles.    The  underlying  waves  do  not  cancel,
however.    Consequently,  intermittent  flows  arise,  with  an  rms  amplitude
varying,  like  the  individual  wave  fields,  as  1/r   from  the  center  of  mass.
These  intermittent  flows  decrease  the  effective  velocity  of  waves;  i.e.,  the
value of c is locally reduced.  This slowing is taken as the basis of gravitation.
Since the 4-D velocity, c, determines the rate of all physical processes, these
are observed to slow also, as in Einstein's general relativity.  In this case, the
gravitational bending of light corresponds to ordinary refraction.

2

11.) The wave medium, stuff, is assumed to have a fractal-like character, with
additional wave structures at much larger and smaller scales.  As in FPU
recurrence, wave energy can be gradually transferred up or down between
scales, changing the effective temperature or density of stuff at those levels.
Because  acoustic  wave  velocity  depends  on  these  parameters,  c  is  also
allowed to change over time.  (Again, this determines the rate of physical
processes at the macroscopic scale.)  An increasing c is proposed as the cause
of the Hubble redshift seen in light from distant galaxies.

Until  recently,  the  Hubble  redshift  has  been  taken  as  final  proof  of  Einstein's  general
relativity.  The effect was thought to be readily explained on the basis of a finite, expanding
universe,  allowed  by  a  curved  Minkowski  space-time.    However,  the  original  Big  Bang
model is contradicted now by a variety of observations.  An example cited previously is the
distance  to  the  galaxy  M100  measured  by  the  Hubble  Space  Telescope.    Based  on  the
standard Big Bang model, this puts the age of the universe at about 8 billion years.  This is
under  the estimated age of the oldest stars.38

92

It's also difficult to reconcile the Big Bang with the discovery of very-large-scale structures,
such  as  the  Great  Wall  or  the  Great  Attractor.    Most  importantly,  there  is  the  flatness
problem.    From  the  observed  distribution  of  galaxies,  the  large-scale  curvature  of  the
universe is relatively small, or nonexistent.  Again, according to Linde , the discrepancy
between the observed curvature and that predicted by general relativity and the Big Bang
is roughly sixty orders of magnitude.  Astronomical observation, once taken as confirmation
of Einstein's general relativity, now speaks against it.

37

In contrast, the theory presented here allows a macroscopic universe older than its stars, with
mature structures, and predicts an inherently flat geometry.  (In addition, it predicts new
nonlinear wave effects, which may be verifiable through computer simulation.)  There is also
the broad unification of physics, in a much simpler paradigm.  For the first time, relativity
and  quantum  mechanics  are  joined.    Both  the  wave  and  particle  aspects  of  elementary
particles find a single, coherent representation.  And there appears to be a truly unified
physical basis for the known natural forces.

Einstein argued that a preferred frame should not be hypothesized if it can't be identified
experimentally.  However, at least a very special case of linear motion is precisely defined
by the cosmic microwave background.  This apparently corresponds to the overall system
of celestial matter -- the same one Einstein took as the preferred frame for rotation.  Since
there presumably is some coupling between its different scales, it’s no less reasonable to take
this as the frame of our wave medium, stuff.

Physics has seen so little fundamental progress, for so long, it's often remarked that "physics
is dead.
  Is it proper, then, to continue taking our most fundamental physical assumptions
#
on faith?  Shouldn't we have the courage to explore valid alternatives, such as the relativity
of Lorentz and Poincaré, and the quantum mechanics of de Broglie, Bohm and Vigier?  To
solve a maze, sometimes it's necessary to double back and take a different path.

Thanks to Eduardo Cantoral for his counsel.  And I'd especially like to thank Surrendar
Jeyadev, who edited the manuscript.  (The remaining informal language is all my fault.)  This
journey of ideas is dedicated Ken and Pat Krogh, who encouraged every step.

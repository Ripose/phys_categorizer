Limits on Relief through Constrained Exchange on Random Graphs

Abstract 
Agents are represented by nodes on a random graph (e.g., small world or truncated power 
law).  Each agent is endowed with a zero-mean random value that may be either positive 
or negative.  All agents attempt to find relief, i.e., to reduce the magnitude of that initial 
value, to zero if possible, through exchanges.  The exchange occurs only between agents 
that are linked, a constraint that turns out to dominate the results.  The exchange process 
continues until a Pareto equilibrium is achieved.  Only 40%-90% of the agents achieved 
relief on small world graphs with mean degree between 2 and 40.  Even fewer agents 
achieved relief on scale-free like graphs with a truncated power law degree distribution.  
The rate at which relief grew with increasing degree was slow, only at most logarithmic 
for all of the graphs considered; viewed in reverse, relief is resilient to the removal of 
links.

Introduction 
We describe a simple model to describe a system of agents who each create excesses 
internally and independently of other agents.  The agents are required to relieve their 
excess through exchanges with other agents.  Relief is the state of zero excess because 
surpluses and deficits are equally undesirable for the agents.  Agents interact only when 
their own excesses drive them to seek relief through exchanges.    It is convenient to 
represent agents by nodes on a graph, where the links represent a route for a feasible 
exchange between pairs of agents.  The exchange between two directly linked agents 
occurs if and only if one of the agents possesses a surplus and the other a deficit.  Here 
we are interested in exchanges between agents on graphs of moderate degree that may be 
qualitatively representative of agent interactions in a wide variety of physical or social 
contexts [1-6].  Restricting the number of other agents that can exchange with a given 
agent turns out to impose strong limits on the relief that can be achieved even when 
(within these constraints) the best possible exchanges occur.  The following section 
provides a detailed description of the model.  Subsequent sections provide results, 
discussion, and conclusions. 
 
In order to give this exchange process a more formal economic interpretation, the agent’s 
excess may be imagined to be one of two goods, one good represented numerically as a 
positive quantity (surplus) while the other good represented as a negative quantity 
(deficit).  Each agent has a Leontief (fixed proportions) utility function such that utility 
gains are only possible when equal quantities of goods are obtained [7].  With this 
representation, the supply and demand curves are perfectly inelastic; the quantity 
demanded or supplied is independent of price, which is set to unity for the whole system.  
An agent maximizes its utility when it is able to balance its quantity of one good with an 
equal quantity of the other good.  Because each agent is given an initial endowment, an 
agent is able to achieve a higher utility than his initial state by trading, but is restricted in 
his trading partners to only its neighbors, as determined by the graph.  The exchange 
process continues until one of the many possible Pareto equilibria is achieved [7]. 
 
This study is related to but nevertheless different from studies that have been concerned 
with wealth distributions achieved through exchanges of goods.  In some of these studies, 
the assumption that all agents interact with all other agents seems at least implicit [8-11], 
in network terms, this corresponds to placing agents on the complete graph.  There has 
been some recent work with agents exchanging on sparse graphs [12, 13]; the agents 
trade with traditional (exponential) utility functions in order to establish a market price 
for the exchange.  A related annihilation model also was studied on small world graphs 
[14].  We didn’t address price formation or wealth distributions in this work.  Instead we 
postpone to future investigation the gains from exchange for individual agents.  The 
social efficiency of exchanges on networks was another question we didn’t address but 
this has been studied with a detailed exchange model that employed auctions between 
heterogeneous agents on bipartite subgraphs [15].   

Description of the model 

Constructing the Graphs 
All of the graphs employed here were simply connected with undirected links and were 
constructed with some kind of random process except for the square lattice.  The 
complete graph was excluded from this study as we directed our attention to graphs of 
moderate degree.  Trees (acyclic graphs) also were excluded from this study.  All graphs 
were constructed with a minimum degree of two so that no agent would be dependent on 
only one other for relief.  Most of the results presented below were for the small world 
graph, which has been widely employed in recent studies of abstract social systems [1].  
We employed the variant of the small world graph in which extra links were randomly 
added to a graph initially composed of one, two or three offset rings (denoted by “r = 1”, 
“r = 2”, and “r = 3” below, with minimum node degree of two, four and six respectively), 
that contained all of the nodes, as employed by, e.g., Bollobás et al. [16] or Guclu et al. 
[17] instead of the rewiring algorithm in the original Watts-Strogatz model [18].  A few 
realizations of the Erdös-Rényi (E-R) random graph [19] were also employed for 
comparison.  One instance of a 2025 node (
45×
boundary conditions, was also included.  Finally, a few realizations of a truncated power-
law graph were constructed with the “random configuration model” [1, 20] so that each 
of the scale-free-like graphs were generated with their density distribution of degree k 
proportional to 
160
mean degrees.   
 
The number of nodes was set to N = 2000 for all graphs except for the 2025-node square 
lattice.  The mean degree is 
 where E is the number of links.  In constructing the 
graphs from the various algorithms, only the largest connected component (i.e., the giant 
component) of the graph was chosen; in practice this precaution had a negligible effect on 
the results.

Initializing the Agents 
Each of the N nodes (agents) of the graph was assigned an “excess”, i.e., a real number x 
drawn randomly from a real-valued density distribution g, symmetric about zero, with 
zero mean and median.  The excess is a “surplus” if x is positive and a “deficit” if x is 
negative (alternatively, it is one good or the other corresponding to the sign of x).  For 
this study we chose g to be a slightly modified normal distribution with deviation 
.  The modifications 
the mean magnitude of the initial excess was 
consisted of ensuring that the magnitude of every excess was at least 0.001 
(accomplished by redrawing the excess otherwise) and subtracting from it the mean 
excess of that sample (much less than 0.001 in magnitude) so that each resulting sample 
of the excesses summed to zero.  This initialization process produced a small fraction of 
nodes ineligible to participate in the exchange because all of their neighbors were 
initialized with the same sign of excess.

Exchange Process 
After initializing each node’s respective excess, the exchange process was initiated by 
uniformly randomly selecting a link.  An exchange would take place between its nodes 
(say j and k) if and only if

With one of the node’s excess set to 0 after the exchange, no further exchanges can occur 
on that link, so it is removed from the list (but not the graph) of eligible links.  The link 
selection continued until no links remained eligible for exchanges, i.e., 

0≥
and k that shared a link.  The final configuration is one of many Pareto equilibria; 
alternatively it is one of the many absorbing states of this random walk.  The link 
selection process excludes next-nearest neighbor exchanges between nodes.   
 
A node’s excess either remains constant or becomes reduced in magnitude after an 
exchange.  In each exchange the node of lesser magnitude would be relieved and would 
become ineligible for further exchanges.  The other node nevertheless receives a 
reduction of its excess and remains eligible for further exchanges.  No agent moves 
farther from relief as the result of any exchange.  No node acquires more of the opposite 
excess than is needed for it to achieve relief, i.e., the excess may become zero but it never 
switches sign.   
 
The resulting excesses (including the zero excesses of the relieved nodes) contributed one 
sample to the distribution of excess.  Multiple samples were obtained by resetting all 
excess values on the same graph and repeating the exchange procedure above 100 times 
in order to eliminate any dependence of the result on the order of the link selection.  
Multiple realizations were achieved by generating 100 graphs of each type, for each mean 
degree.   

Results 
For each graph, the distribution of excess at the end of the exchange process was 
symmetric and nearly normal, also with zero mean but with a smaller variance.  Figure 1 
displays the mean of the fraction of nodes relieved (frelieved), for various graphs with 
varying mean degree and the mean of the fraction of nodes (feligible) initially eligible to 
participate in an exchange.  The distributions of frelieved and feligible were each essentially 
normal for each graph, with one deviation displayed as error bars in Figure 1; in some 
cases, the deviation is smaller than the size of the symbol in the plot.  The plot indicates 
that the mean frelieved increased at most logarithmically with increasing degree, for any 
kind of graph.  For each graph, except for the square lattice, the mean frelieved was well 
above its respective site percolation threshold [21]; for the square lattice it was just below 
its site percolation threshold (0.55 vs. 0.59).  Nevertheless the relief was far from 
complete for any graph, even for those graphs in which nearly all nodes were initially 
eligible to participate in an exchange.  For the E-R and small world graphs, a mean 
degree of about 40 was required to achieve even 90% relief, for which the degree 
distributions of the small world graphs had become essentially the same as those of the E-

R graph (i.e., Poisson, see [19]).  Much less relief was achieved in the truncated power-
law (scale-free-like) graphs compared to the small world and E-R random graphs.

Figure 1.  The mean fraction of relieved nodes and the mean fraction of eligible nodes vs. the 
mean degree for various graphs.  The symbols, some with dashed straight lines (see legend), are 
the values for the fraction of relieved nodes.  The solid lines are splines between the values for the 
fraction eligible nodes.  The “error bars” correspond to uncertainty intervals of plus or minus one 
standard deviation, respectively. 

 
Figure 2 shows typical results for the fraction of relieved nodes as a function of the 
node’s degree, which indicates a slowly increasing frequency of relief for the nodes of 
increasing degree.  Figure 2 shows only the results for which the standard deviation is 
small; where the number of nodes of a given degree is small the uncertainty becomes 
large.

Figure 2.  Mean fraction of nodes relieved by degree for two comparable graphs.  The mean 
degree of the small world (r = 2) and the truncated power law graph was 16.8 and 15.8, 
respectively.  The solid “error bars” correspond to uncertainty intervals of plus or minus one 
standard deviation, respectively.  The results were truncated where the standard deviation grew 
rapidly, resulting from a small population of nodes with that degree.  The dashed lines are guides 
to the eye. 

 
We didn’t show the degree distribution of the relieved nodes for each graph because it 
always closely tracked the degree distribution of the original graph.  The results were 
insensitive to a wide range of possible choices for the initial parameters, distributions and 
rules for the exchange.  In particular, the results were insensitive to increasing the number 
of trials and increasing the number of graphs that contribute to the samples.  They were 
also insensitive to increasing the number of nodes in the graphs.  The results were 
insensitive to the differences in the disorder between the different kinds of small world 
graphs, between the small world and the E-R random graphs, and even between the small 
world or E-R graphs and the square lattice.  Variations in the initial distribution of the 
excess had a negligible impact on the results, as long as the distribution was symmetric 
about zero, a remark that applies not only to the choice of the deviation for the normal 
distribution, but even on the kind of distribution (normal vs. bounded uniform).  We 
initially thought that forcing the exchanges to be incremental by placing limits on the 
magnitude of each exchange would allow more nodes to achieve relief.  Nevertheless, for 
limits as small as 0.1, the results obtained (for the graphs mentioned in Figure 2) with 
these limits were within a standard deviation of those obtained without limits.   
 
We didn’t pursue here an examination of the stability of the metastable equilibria 
achieved by the exchange process but we note that the following sequence of 

perturbations slowly leads to a system without any relieved agents: assign new excesses 
only to all of the relieved agents and reapply the exchange process until a new 
equilibrium is achieved.  At least a thousand cycles were required to eliminate relieved 
agents.  We defer a discussion of this evolution to future work. 
 

Discussion and Conclusions 
This simple model has a complicated solution, without a closed form (as far as we know) 
for any but the complete graph [22] yet it lacks the usual indicators of complexity or 
“system behavior” [1-3].  The distribution of excess at the end of the process is 
essentially normal even on the truncated power-law graphs.  The model doesn’t display 
any kind of phase transition.  The model shows no statistically significant difference in 
the equilibrium that results from exchanges that proceed for the maximum benefit of the 
pair of agents involved and those which resulted from exchanges that were limited by an 
external rule.   
 
The difference in relief achieved by the scale-free-like truncated power law graphs on the 
one hand and the small world and E-R graphs on the other suggests that, for the same 
mean degree, the graph with the more homogeneous degree distribution achieves more 
relief and that the benefits of homogeneity increase with increasing mean degree.  The 
truncated power law graphs have a few highly connected nodes that always get relief but 
a large number of low degree nodes that get much less relief; in other words, those few 
highly connected nodes that frequently got relief contributed very little to the relief of the 
whole system.   
 
Complete relief should be achieved with this exchange process on a complete graph but 
we were surprised by the high numbers of links that were required to achieve even 90% 
relief on the much less connected graphs studied here.  We weren’t surprised that 
increasing the mean degree of the graph increased the relief and that the higher degree 
nodes received more relief than the lower degree nodes but we were surprised by the 
slow, at most logarithmic growth in relief with increasing degree.  If the cost of acquiring 
a link to another agent remains constant (e.g., no discounts), then the cumulative costs of 
acquiring links would grow linearly with degree.  Viewed in reverse, the results suggest 
that the achievement of relief is resilient (or insensitive) to node or edge removal for all 
graphs.

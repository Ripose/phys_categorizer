Abstract: To analyze nonidealities inherent to degenerate plasma, a quantum collective approach is developed. 
Thermodynamic functions of a system of partially degenerate electrons and strongly coupled ions are derived from 
first principles. The model takes into account the energy eigenvalues of i) the thermal translational particle motions, 
ii) the random collective electron and ion motions, and iii) the static Coulomb interaction energy of the electrons and 
ions in their oscillatory equilibrium positions. These statistical thermodynamic calculations lead to simple analytical 
expressions  for  internal energy as  well as  an  equation of state (EOS). A dispersion relation for the high frequency 
branch of the plasma oscillations is introduced to take into account the partial degeneracy character and thereby to 
quantify  temperature  finiteness  effects  on  thermodynamic  properties  of  a  partially  degenerate  plasma.  The  present 
results  are  in  good  quantitative  agreement  with  the  existing  models.  These  latter  being  based  mainly  on  numerical 
experiments  while in  the  present  model  more physical insight is explicitly  stated. This makes a contribution to the 
theoretical knowledge of coupled plasma for thermonuclear fusion as well as of astrophysical interests.   
 

I. INTRODUCTION 

Thermodynamic  properties  of  high  density  plasma  with  completely  or  partially  degenerate 

electrons  and  strongly  coupled  ions  are  a  subject  of  great  interest,  where  more  refinements  are 

still needed. Strongly coupled plasmas are currently produced by heavy ion beam interaction with 

solid  targets,  with  densities  close  to  those  of  solid  state  [1].  Recent  equation  of  state  (EOS) 

measurements,  with  a  variety  of  techniques,  have  been  obtained  for  liquid  deuterium  and 

thoroughly discussed [2-4]. 

The understanding and the interpretation of these experimental results require a fundamental and 

rigorous approach which must take into account the main character of the medium such as strong 

coupling, degeneracy as well as quantum effects. 

Several  models  have  been  developed  with  different  assumptions  and  applied  to  determine 

thermodynamic  as  well  as  the  static  and  dynamic  correlation  functions,  where  the  physical 

situation has, often, been described by the simple model of the classical one-component plasma 

(OCP) [5,6]. Even though the OCP model may explain many important characteristics of dense 

ionized  matter,  but  for  some  domain  of  physical  parameters  one  has  to  take  into  account  some 

nonidealities, as for instance the polarization of electrons, which induces the screening of ionic 

charges while static and dynamic properties of the system are thereby modified from those of the 

OCP. 

Various investigations have been done to analyze the nonideal or high density plasmas properties 

where  the  Monte  Carlo  numerical  experiments  were  the  mostly  performed  approaches  [6-9],  to 

which some theoretical models are being developed and compared [10]. 

Moreover,  the  density  fluctuations  for  dense  plasmas  can  be  split  into  two  approximately 

independent  components  associated,  respectively,  with  the  collective  and  individual  aspects  of 

the system. The collective component, which is present only for wavelengths greater than Debye 

length,  represents  organized  oscillations,  brought  about  by  the  long-range  part  of  the  Coulomb 

interactions  [11].  When  such  an  oscillation  is  excited,  each  individual  particle  suffers  a  small 

perturbation of its velocity and position, arising from the combined potential of all other particles. 

The contribution to the density fluctuations resulting from these perturbations is in phase with the 

potential  producing  it,  so  that  in  an  oscillation  it  is  found  an  organized  wave-like  perturbation 

superposed on the random thermal motion of the particle. 

For  the  high  density,  partially  or  completely  degenerate  plasma,  i.e.,  at  relatively  low 

temperature,  the  thermal  motion  no  longer  plays  the  dominant  role.  Instead  the  cumulative 

potential  of  all  particles  will  be  considerable  because  the  range  of  the  force  permits  to  a  very 

large  number  of  particles  to  contribute  to  the  potential  at  a  given  point.  Hence  the  collective 

aspect would be dominant and particularly governs the thermodynamic properties of the plasma 

in consideration here. 

In addition this aspect of collective approach has proven to be a very efficient model to govern 

the transport phenomena and the relaxation processes in strongly coupled plasma [12]. For these 

reasons, a quantum statistical theory will be presented here, for strongly coupled plasma, based 

on  concepts  similar  to  those  used  by  Debye  for  solids  [13]  and  carry  this  approach  further  to 

obtain a quantification of thermodynamic quantities, while including several nonideal effects. 

The  role  of  the  longitudinal  phonons  of  the  Debye  theory  is  played  here  by  the  quanta  of  the 

plasma oscillations (plasmons and ion sound waves). 

Moreover,  even  though  zero  temperature  calculations  may  be  useful  for  many  applications 

especially for evaluating the chemical composition of condensed matter, they cannot be applied 

to  quantify  some  parameters  at  finite  temperature,  since  they  do  not  provide  information  about 

thermal properties such as heat capacity or adiabatic exponents. Furthermore, a characteristic and 

important feature of high density plasma is precisely the involvement of a wide range of Fermi 

degeneracy, i.e., with finite electron temperature. 

For that, dispersion relations as functions of both, the temperature and the Fermi energy, i.e., the 

density,  will  be  introduced  in  the  present  work,  and  will  make  possible  the  calculations  of  the 

thermodynamic functions of partially degenerate plasma. 

Moreover,  in  order  to  complete  the  whole  picture  of  the  present  model,  it  should  be  noted  as 

stated above, that the collective motion of the particles is superposed on their individual random 

thermal motion. This approach to be applied to dense plasmas is justified since the medium can 

be described as distorted lattice. The ions are kept in positions with lattice-like structure due to 

the strong interparticle correlations, but with an incomplete ordering. The system being a fluid, 

the average position of the particles changes slowly with time unlike the real lattice that appears 

with stronger correlations [14]. 

II. STATISTICAL THERMODYNAMICS 

In  the  plasma  under  consideration,  the  electrons  and  ions  interact  through  their  longitudinal 

Coulomb fields (transverse electromagnetic interactions are negligible in the present model). 

The resulting Hamilton function with Coulomb interactions gives the free energy of the system

ME   is  the 

Coulomb interaction energy of the electrons and ions in their equilibrium positions, and 

 is the

free energy of the electron and ion oscillations. 

In the Hamilton function [Eq.(1)] the most significant, short and long range Coulomb interactions 

are taken into consideration for all types and species, e-i , e-e and i-i by means of the Madelung 

energy  ME  and the plasmon energy 

 for which s = e corresponds to the high frequency branch

and s = i are the ion sound waves (low frequency branch). 
Moreover,  in  equation  (1)  the  main  interest  is  to  be  given  to  FD

  since  F0,  for  partially  or 

completely  degenerate  electrons  are  given  by  Tolman  [15],  where  the  ions  behave  in  general 

classically. 

The  equilibrium  positions  of  the  electrons  and  ions,  about  which  the  electrostatic  oscillations 

occur form a lattice-like with an incomplete ordering for each electron and each ion. 

The Coulomb interaction energy being equivalent for both electron or ion lattice, the Madelung

As to the free energy of the plasma oscillations, it can be deduced from statistical thermodynamic 

approach. 

Since  the  plasma  volume  V  contains  N  electrons  and  N/Z  ions,  there  exist  N  (high  frequency 

branch)  and  N/Z  (low  frequency  branch)  characteristic  frequencies  of  longitudinal  oscillations.

III RESULTS AND COMPARISONS 

In this section, the results obtained by the present method will be analyzed and also compared to 

existing approaches. First of all, the major results of the present work are analytical expressions 

for  free  energy  from  which  all  the  thermodynamic  functions  can  be  derived. Internal energy  as 

well as the equation of state are explicitly reported for dense two component plasma over a wide 

range of density and temperature. 

Thermodynamic functions derived, through a relatively simple procedure, will be studied in the 
context  of  partial  degeneracy  through  the  variable  q

,  the  coupling  strength  G

E/Tk=q

,  (

 

B

F

where 

 is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature and 

B

FE  the Fermi energy). 

As  it  will  be  seen,  the  present  results  compare  very  well  with  the  existing  theories,  with  more 

physical insight allowed by the statistical thermodynamic approach of the present calculations. 

The variety of effects described in the present collective approach are the dynamic screening, the 

incomplete degeneracy (temperature finiteness) through the development of a dispersion relation 

depending on both the Fermi energy as well as the temperature and the quantum effects through 

the  general  character  of  the  model  which  considers  the  plasma  as  an  ensemble  of  elementary 

excitations that are quasi-particles. 

By analogy to most existing models, the Madelung contribution to the thermodynamic functions 

of the present theory, should behave as the OCP contribution while the high and 

low frequency branches oscillations play the role of corrections due to the nonideal effects. 

As  a  matter  of  fact,  just  as  in  the  numerical  experiment  where  the  OCP  contributions  are  the 

leading  terms,  in  the  present  model,  quantitatively  the  Madelung  energy  is  by  far  the  most 
dominant part in the interaction energy [Eq. (1)], especially in the strong coupling regime ( G

 > 

2).  Moreover,  Madelung  contribution  to  the  internal  energy  as  well  as  to  the  pressure  have  the 

same behavior as the OCP quantities, where some values, for a wide range of coupling strength 

are given in Table I. The relative deviation between the two models is seen to be small, less than 
10 %, and particularly as  G

 grows ( G > 10).

To develop further the quantitative analysis, a comparison is presented showing the results of the 

present  model  and  those  of  the  most  existing  theories  which  have  been  analyzed  and  some  of 

them improved in a comprehensive work by Galam and Hansen [7].

coupling strengths.

and  compared  to  those  obtained  by  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  DeWitt  and  Hubbard  [16], 

perturbation expansion (pert.) and also 

TFq  expansion (where  

TFq   is the dimensionless Thomas 

Fermi wave number), (Var. OCP) are results of a variational method based on Gibbs-Bogolyobov 

inequality and the physical idea of an effective charge reduction of the ions. The last two columns 

are the results of the hard sphere variational approach (Var. HS1) while (Var. HS2) are the results 

of the same method proposed by Ross and Seale [17]. 

The  general  statement  which  can  be  made  on  the  value  of  the  excess  pressure  and  the  internal 

energy  reported  in  Table  II  is  that  they  are  globally  very  close  to  each  other.  The  slight 

discrepancies between the different models are still contained within few percents. 

Moreover,  the  present  model  presents  the  advantage  by  the  analytical  feature  of  the  results  to 

obtain  the  thermal  parameters  such  as  heat  capacity  adiabatic  exponents  which  can  be  easily 

deduced as follows: 

The heat capacity at constant volume is

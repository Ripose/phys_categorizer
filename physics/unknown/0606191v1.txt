nowledge   of   the   seafloor 
sediments   in   littoral   regions   is 
of interest to such diverse groups as 
the   world's   navies,   fisheries,   marine 
construction companies and the U.S. 
Environmental   Protection   Agency 
(EPA).   Navies   are   concerned   with 
sonar performance, mine warfare and 
antisubmarine   operations.   Fisheries 
search for marine-life habitats, while 
construction companies  need to plan 
routes for laying pipelines and cables. 
Finally,   the   EPA   wishes   to   track 
absorption   of   contaminants,   and   the 
absorption   rate   is   affected   by   the 
sediment type.

Traditional  methods  for  obtaining 
information on seafloor sediments are 
slow and labor intensive. Divers may 
take   underwater   photographs,   and 
survey   vessels   often   procure   grab 
samples   and   cores.   The   photos   are 
then analyzed, and the grab samples 

and cores are taken to a laboratory 
to   determine   sediment-grain   size 
distributions.
  Acoustic   remote 
sensing   of   the   seafloor   advanced 
greatly   with   the   advent   of 
multibeam sonar. Though primarily 
used for obtaining bathymetry, the 
wealth of data available makes the 
goal   of   bottom   characterization 
from   multibeam   systems   enticing. 
This   article   describes   an   acoustic 
remote sensing technique that was 
developed   (and   packaged   as 
SediMap®) 
the   Marine 
in  
Geosciences   Division   at   the   U.S. 
Naval   Research   Laboratory.1   The 
article also discusses the impact of 
this   technology   on   oceanographic 
surveys and geologic interpretation.

Model and Technique

Multibeam sonars receive sound 
beams from multiple  angles  along 
the cross-track swath. The acoustic 
intensity corresponding to the echo 
from   each   beam   may  be   recorded 
for every ping. The strength of the 
seafloor scattering in the direction 
of
is   called 
“backscattering,”   strength   and   is 
derived   from   the   echo   intensities. 
This   results   in   data   that   has 
backscattering   strength   as   a 
function of beam angle.

This   backscattering   strength 

data may be compared to the acoustic 
backscattering   model   derived   by 
Darrel   Jackson   and   others   at   the 
Applied   Physics   Laboratory   at   the 
University   of   Washington   (APL-
UW).2 
  predicts 
The   model
backscattering strength as a  function 
of   the   seafloor-incidence   angle.   By 
tracing   the   sound   rays   in   the   water, 
incidence angles may be converted to 
beam   angles.   Among   the   six   input 
values   for   the   APL-UW   model   are 
sediment   density,   sediment   sound 
speed   and   roughness   parameters. 
Based on physical considerations and 
emperical data, these input parameters 
are mapped to mean-grain size.

technique.4  The   best-fit   parameters 
are  then mapped  to  mean grain size 
for   an   estimate   of   the   bottom 
sediment.  Averaging   over   groups   of 
pings,   these   steps   are   repeated   until 
sediment   estimates   are   obtained   for 
the entire survey.

Multibeam Systems

SediMap   has   been   tested   using 
Kongsberg   Maritime   (Kongsberg, 
Norway)   EM   121   and   EM   1002 
multibeam   echo   sounders.   The   EM 

121   echo   sounder   operates   at   a 
frequency of 12 kilohertz and forms 
121 beams across the ship track in a 
120° swath with 1° separation among 
beams. Good results may be obtained 
in water depths of 100 to 400 meters. 
For shallow areas (10 to 200 meters), 
the   EM   1002   echo   sounder   is 
appropriate. The EM 1002 operates at 
95   kilohertz   with   111   beams   in   a 
swath up to 150°. It should be noted 
that the echo sounders report accurate 
bathymetry   for   much   larger   water 
depth ranges. The ranges given above 
indicate   the   water   depths   for   which 
the authors of this article have tested 
and gained confidence in the recorded 
backscattering strengths.

Results

 

 

vessel

Bottom   sediments   in   the   testing 
areas   ranged   from   clay   to   gravel   in 
water depths from 10 to 400 meters. 
SediMap estimates from three surveys 
were   compared  to   38   core   and   grab 
samples with a grain size correlation 
0.72.   A   sea   trial   onboard   a   Naval 
Oceanographic   Office   T-AGS   60

demonstrated   the   utility   of   using 
SediMap   for   the   planning   of   core 
locations.   The   backscattering   data 
was processed in near-real time, and 
patches   of   coarse   sediments   were 
discovered and verified by obtaining 
cores.   In   fact,   the   coarse   sediment 
patches   could   not   be   distinguished 
from the fine sediment by viewing the 
multibeam   imagery,   but   was   clearly 
identified with the SediMap results.

Enhancement with Segmentation

If   the   survey   area   has   dense 
coverage (e.g., multiple parallel tracks 
with some overlap in the swaths), the 
data   may   be   grouped   by   areas   of 
similar   acoustic   “texture”.   This   is

method to separate the image into 
segments   of   similar   texture.5  Data 
from   each   image   segment   is   then 
averaged   and   processed   to   obtain 
sediment   grain   size   estimates   in 
those   segments.
  After   image 
segmentation,   far   fewer   sediment 
estimates are required, resulting in 
a greatly reduced processing time. 

Impact for Oceanography 

SediMap will be transitioned to 
the   Naval   Oceanographic   Office 
and is likely to be utilized as a tool 
for efficient planning for core and 
grab   sample   locations,   as   a   guide 
for geologists in mapping seafloor 
sediments   and   to   be   used   in   the 
absence of ground truth, as seafloor 
estimates for acoustic modeling and 
archiving.

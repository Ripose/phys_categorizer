ABSTRACT

Using  wavelet  analysis  approach,  the  temporal  variations  of  solar  activity  on  time  scales
ranging from days to decades are examined from the daily time series of sunspot numbers.
A hierarchy of changing complex periods is careful detected  and related cycles compared
with  results  from  recent  similar  analyses.  A  general  determination  of  the  main  Schwabe
cycle length variations is also suggested on the basis of the wavelet amplitude distribution
extracted from the local wavelet power map.

INTRODUCTION

The  multiscale evolution of the solar magnetic fields is extremely complicated and this is
also transferred to the Sun global activity. The spatial and temporal patterns appearing on
the surface of the Sun reflect the underlying dynamo mechanisms which drive the turbulent
plasma motions inside the convection region. There exist now many strong indications that
the  related  dynamics  is  well  described,  at  least  for  a  limited  range  of  scales,  by  a  low
dimensional chaotic system [1],[2],[3].
The  traditional  way  to  record  the  variations  of  solar  activity  is  to  observe  the  sunspot
numbers which provide an index of the activity of the whole visible disk of the Sun. These
numbers  are  determined  each  day  and  are  calculated  counting  both  isolated  clusters  of
sunspots,  or  sunspot  groups,  and  distinct  spots.  The  current  determination  of  the
international sunspot number, Ri, from the Sunspot Index Data Center of Bruxelles, results
from  a  statistical  elaboration  of  the  data  deriving  from  an  international  network  of  more
than twenty five observing stations. Despite sunspot numbers are an indirect measure of the
actual physics of the Sun photosphere, they have the great advantage of covering various
centuries  of  time.  This  property  results  very  crucial  when  we  focus    the  attention  on
complex variations of scales and cycles related to the solar magnetic activity.

Many  previous  works  based  on  standard  correlation  and  Fourier  spectral  analyses  of  the
sunspot numbers time series, reveal a high energy content corresponding to the Schawbe
(~11  years)  and  a  lower  energy  long  term  modulation  corresponding  to  the  Gleissberg
(~100 years) cycles. A clear peak is also evident near the 27 days solar rotation as viewed
from  Earth.  More  careful  statistical  analyses  show  that  these  periodicities    are  in  fact
strongly  changing  both  in  amplitude  and  in  scale,  showing  clear  features  of  transient
phenomena and intermittency [1]. The non stationary feature of those time series  is well
pointed  out  by  the  temporal  behaviour  of  the  related  high  level  variance  (2nd  order
moment).    Wavelet  analysis  offers  an  alternative  to  Fourier  based  time  series  analysis,
especially when spectral features  are  time  dependent.  By  decomposing  a  time  series  into
time-frequency space we are able to determine both the dominant modes and how they vary
with time. Multiscale analysis based on the wavelet approach, has now been successfully
used  for  many  different  physical  applications,  including  geophysical  processes,  bio-
medicine,  and  flow  turbulence  [4].  A  high  development  for  astrophysical  applications
resulted  as  a  consequence  of  an  extension  of  the  wavelet  approach  to  unevenly  sampled
time series, proposed by Foster in 1996 [5].
There are relatively few and recent works documented in literature, related to applications
of wavelet analysis to solar activity, the first one dated back to 1993 by Ochadlick [6]. In
the paper the author used a wavelet approach to detect "subtle"  variations in the solar cycle
period from yearly means of sunspot numbers. Multiscaling and intermittency features have
been  well  analysed  through  the  use  of  a  continuous  Morlet  wavelet    transform  on  the
monthly  sunspot  numbers  time  series  in  the  work  of  Lawrence  et  al.  (1995)  [1].    More
recently,  different  authors  used  longer  daily  sunspot  numbers  time  series  to  investigate
more accurately new subtle periodicities and their evolutions [7],[8].
The main aim of the present paper is to add a further contribution to the wavelet analyses
of  solar  activity  through  the  application  of  the  Foster  projection  method  (with  the
estimation  of  confidence  levels),  to  unevenly  sampled  time  series  derived  from  daily
international  sunspot  numbers  (1818-1999)  (SIDC)  [9],  and  from  less  noisy  daily  group
sunspot numbers (1610-1995) (Hoyt and Schatten) [10].

WAVELET ANALYSIS

Fourier  analysis  is  an  adequate  tool  for  detecting  and  quantifying  constant  periodic
fluctuations  in  time  series.  For  intermittent  and  transient  multiscale  phenomena,  the
wavelet  transform  is  able  to  detect  time  evolutions  of  the  frequency  distribution.  The
continuous wavelet transform represents an optimal localized decomposition of time series,
x(t), as a function of both time t and frequency (scale) a, from a convolution integral:

where w 0  is the non dimensional frequency here taken to be equal to 6 in order to satisfy
the  admissibility  condition.  For  a  more  comprehensive  and  detailed  description  of  the
wavelet formalism see references [11], [12].
Following Foster (1996) [5] here we consider an extension of the above wavelet formalism
in order to correct handle irregularly sampled time series. The wavelet transform is viewed
as a suitable weighted projection onto three trial functions giving the Weighted Wavelet Z
transform and the Weighted Wavelet Amplitudes. For all the mathematical details of this
formulation  and  its  applications  we  refer  to  Foster  (1996)  and  Haubold  (1998)  papers
[5],[12].

Many applications of the wavelet analysis suffered from  an  apparent  lack  of  quantitative
evaluations  especially  by  the  use  of  arbitrary  normalization  and  the  lack  of  statistical
significance test in order to estimate the reliability of results. Here we used power spectrum
normalization and significance levels following the approach suggested by Torrence et al.
(1997). We first assume an appropriate background spectrum and we suppose that different
realizations  of  the  considered  physical  process  will  be  randomly  distributed  about  this
expected  background  spectrum.  The  actual  spectrum  is  compared  against  this  random
distribution. In the present work we assumed as background spectrum a red noise spectrum
modeled through a univariate lag-1 autoregressive process:

and the following null hypothesis is defined for the wavelet power spectrum: we assume
the  red  noise  spectrum  as  the  mean  power  spectrum  of  the  time  series;  if  a  peak    in  the
wavelet  power  spectrum  is  significantly  (here  at  95%  confidence  level)  above  this
background spectrum, then it can be considered to be a real feature of the time series (see
[11]).

SOLAR ACTIVITY: SUNSPOT NUMBERS

We  considered  here  two  records  of  solar  activity:  1)  the  daily  international  number  of
sunspots from SIDC archive covering the time interval: 1818-1999 and consisting of 66474
observations; 2) the daily number of sunspots groups  visible on the Sun surface between
1610  and  1995  recently  made  available  by    Hoyt  and  Schatten  [10],  and  consisting  of
111358 observations. These time series are irregularly sampled especially in the first part
of  the  records.  The  importance  of  the  last  time  series  results  in  its  more  internally  self-
consistency and in its lesser noise level than that of the Wolf sunspot numbers. It uses only
the number of sunspot groups  observed,  rather  than  groups  and  individual  sunspots.  The
group sunspot numbers use 65941 observations from 117 observers active before 1874 not
used  by  Wolf  in  its  original  time  series.  The  noise  contained  in  this  time  series  is
considerably  less  than  the  noise  contained  in  the  Wolf  sunspot  numbers.  Of  course  the
numerical computation of the wavelet spectrum is here very expensive and time consuming
due to the high number of data contained in the record.
Moreover, recently Ballester et al. (1999) [8], analyzing the daily group sunspot numbers
with  a  wavelet  approach,  detect  local  episodes  of  the  periodicity  near  158  days  (varying
from 140 to 170 days)  around  the  maximum  of  solar  cycle  2  and  around  the  maxima  of
solar cycles 16-21. They claimed that the presence  of that periodicity in the group sunspot
numbers confirms that it is caused by a periodic emergence of magnetic flux. A near 154
days periodicity in the Sun was first reported on gamma ray flares, Rieger et al. 1984 [13],
and in other related parameters but it does not seemed to be a persistent periodicity. It is

5

-
-
well known that solar flares are huge explosions on the surface of the Sun, involving time
scales  of  a  few  minutes  and  they  are  thought  to  be  formed  as  magnetic  fields  structures
related to sunspots are twisted, releasing energy by magnetic reconnections. During solar
cycle 21 a periodicity between 152, 158 days in the occurrence rate of energetic flares was
detected by the  Solar Maximum Mission satellite. If we are able to confirm a temporal and
frequency agreement in the wavelet analysis of the group sunspot numbers, we can support
the emergence of magnetic flux in the solar photosphere as the common factor relating the
two phenomena.

-  Daily International Sunspot Numbers

Figure 1 shows the results of the wavelet analysis applied to the series of daily international
sunspot numbers. The upper part shows the original time series in its natural units (red line)
and  the  monthly  smoothed  sunspot  numbers  (green  line)  generally  used  for  solar  cycle
predictions.  Time  is  here  expressed  in  years.  The  central  part  shows  the  amplitudes
(WWA) of the wavelet local power spectrum in terms of an arbitrary colour contour map.
Red higher values are strong energetic contributions to power spectrum, while blue lower
values  are  weak  energetic  contributions.  Horizontal  time  axis  corresponds  to  the  axis  of
time series and vertical scale (frequency) axis is for convenience expressed in log values of
cycles  per  year-1.  Thus  the  range  analyzed  is  between  148  years  (value  -5)  and  2.5  days
(value 5). The right part shows the mean global wavelet power spectrum (red line) obtained
with a time integration of the local wavelet power spectrum, and the 5% significance level
using a red noise autoregressive lag-1 background spectrum with a =0.96 (green line). It is
possible to distinguish two main regions corresponding to sharp Schwabe (~11 years) and
broad  Gleissberg  (~100  years)  with  dominant  energetic  contribution  above  the  red  noise
background spectrum. In particular it is well evident the complex evolution of the Schwabe
cycle both for scales and amplitudes. The irregular finite extension in the map represents a
continuous  interaction  of  frequencies.    It  is  interesting  to  note  the  presence  of  a  non
persistent significant  region around a period of 28 years starting from 1950. In this map
there are not clear evidences of  episodes related to 158 days periodicity (value 0.8). In fact,
for  periods  below  3  years  there  are  not  significant  contributions  in  the  global  energy
spectrum,  suggesting  dominant  stochastic  motions  [1]  with  little  exceptions.  Note  the
complex  shape  regions  around  maxima  of  cycles  related  to  27  days  solar  rotation,  as
viewed from Earth.

-  Daily Group Sunspot Numbers

The original record of daily group sunspot numbers was limited between 1653 and 1995
because  of  the  lack  of  reliability  for  observations  before  1653.  The  total  number  of
observation  is  then  reduced  to  104108.  The  lower  global  level  of  noise  in  this  series  is
evidenced  by  a  reduction  of  the  variance  of  about  25%.  On  the  other  hand,  here  the  red
noise autoregressive lag-1 background spectrum was obtained with a =0.85, i.e. with more
features typical of  white noise. Figure 2 shows the results of the wavelet computation in
the same way of  previous analysis.

7

Figure 2

The high frequency range explored was limited up to 49 days period, due to computational
restrictions.    As  in  the  previous  analysis,  only  two  dominant  peaks  were  detected,
corresponding  to  the  Schwabe  and  the  Gleissberg  cycles.  Here  the  longest  cycle  was
detected  more  precisely,  near  110  years.  The  interesting  part  of  this  wavelet  analysis  is
related  to  the  long  Maunder  minimum  ending  at  1715  and  the  next  weaker  minimum
between 1795 and 1820. The evolution of the main cycle near 11 years, as derived from
both  the  wavelet  analyses,  results  quite  similar.  There  is  a  strong  increase  of  the  energy
contribution for recent cycles, with a continuous irregular variation of the region related to
this  periodicity,  currently  shifted  toward  high  value  frequencies.  Moreover,  a  detailed
inspection of the wavelet map between 140 and 170 days periods, shows again the absence
of  significant  contributions  localised  near  a  158  days  periodicity  for  the  group  sunspot
numbers.  Thus,  our  wavelet  analysis  does  not  support  the  correlation  between  the
periodicity  detected  in  some  high  energy  solar  flares  and  the  periodic  emergence  of
magnetic flux associated to sunspot groups, as indicated in [8].

- Solar Cycle Length

The  long  term  variations  of  the  solar  cycle  length  have  been  widely  studied  and  its
importance is mainly due to their suggested correlation to global climate [14].
Recently Mursula et al. [15], proposed a new method to determine the solar cycle length
based on a difference between the median activity times of two successive sunspot cycles.
The advantage of this method, with respect to a conventional approach,  is that the median
times are almost independent of how the minima or maxima are determined and thus the
computation  results  more  accurate.  More  recently,  Fligge  et  al.  [16],  proposed  a  more
objective and general cycle length determination using a continuous wavelet transform.
Here  we  propose  an  alternative  general  method  to  determine  time  variation  of  the  main
solar cycle, based on the amplitudes of the wavelet map for sunspot group numbers (Figure
2). The main idea is to extract a characteristic frequency (or period) for each time, from an
irregular  shaped  region  related  to  the  main  solar  cycle.    From  the  global  wavelet  power
spectrum we selected a suitable range of frequencies, including the irregular region related
to the Schwabe cycle: w 0 =-3 (20 years),  w 1 =-1.6 (5 years). We then define a characteristic
frequency of the wavelet map, at a given time t, as:

~

w

ww

d

Ww

(

w
Wwd

(

where w(W(w
,t)) are proper weights derived from the intensity of the local wavelet power
map. This characteristic frequency gives a wavelet based evaluation of the evolution of the
periods related to the selected range of frequencies.
When we apply the above relation to the main Schwabe cycle we obtain the result shown in
Figure 3. The central part of the Figure shows the behaviour of the characteristic periods or
lengths of  the solar cycle. For a comparison, we show also the solar cycle lengths obtained
with the median method (blue line) (from [15]). The qualitative behaviour is quite similar,
even  if  the  wavelet  method  gives,  in  general,  lower  values.  The  accuracy  in  the
determination  of    time  variations  of  the  solar  cycle  lengths  is  very  high  for  the  wavelet
method which is completely independent of the arbitrary choice of exact times of sunspots
minima or maxima. The long term evolution of the solar cycle length is then confirmed to
be in good agreement with the climate changes [15], where high periods are related to weak
solar  activity  and  low  periods  are  related  to  strong  solar  activity,  as  well  depicted  in  the
most recent cycles.

CONCLUSIONS

Wavelet analysis approach allows a refined investigation of the temporal variations of solar
activity on time scales ranging from days to decades. Considering the daily time series of
international  sunspot  numbers  and  group  sunspot  numbers,  we  analyzed  a  hierarchy  of
changing complex periods. In  particular,  we  detected  statistically  significant  periodicities
and we excluded a clear evidence of the existence of a near 158 days periodicity correlated
to  high  energy  solar  flares.  A  general  and  accurate  determination  of  the  main  Schwabe
cycle  length  variations  was  also  suggested  on  the  basis  of  the  wavelet  amplitude
distribution, extracted from the local wavelet power map.

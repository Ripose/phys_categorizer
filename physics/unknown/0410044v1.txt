Abstract 

In any polarimetric measurement technique,  enhancing the laser polarization change of 
a laser beam before it  reaches the analyzer can help in improving the sensitivity. This 
can be performed  using an optical component having a large linear dichroism, the 
enhancement factor being equal to the square root of the ratio of the two transmission 
factors. A pile of parallel plates at Brewster incidence looks appropriate for realizing 
such a polarization magnifier. In this paper, we address the problem raised by the 
interference in the plates and between the plates, which affects the measurement by 
giving rise to birefringence. We demonstrate that wedged plates provide a convenient 
and efficient way to avoid this interference. We have implemented and characterized 
devices with 4 and 6 wedged plates at Brewster incidence which have led to a decisive 
improvement of  the signal to noise ratio in our ongoing Parity Violation measurement. 

 

 

 

INTRODUCTION 

Measuring  the  state  of  polarization  of  a  light  beam  lies  at  the  heart  of  many 
fundamental  physics  experiments,  such  as  for  instance  parity  violation  measurements  in 
atoms1,2  or  the  detection  of  vacuum  magnetic  birefringence3,  as  well  as  applied  physics 
measurement  techniques  like  magnetometry4,5    and  ellipsometry6.  In  these  experiments,  the 
quantum  (shot-noise)  ultimate  limit to the measurement of a change in the linear polarization 
of  a  laser  beam  is  often  desired.  However,  extra  sources  of  optical  noise  are  usually  present 
and  can  severely  limit  the  sensitivity  of  the  measurement.  In  this  case,  enhancing  the 
polarization change before it reaches the polarimetric detection system helps in improving the 
sensitivity.  This  enhancement  can  be  achieved  using  an  additional  optical  component  with  a

So  far,  two  realizations  of  such  a  polarization  magnifier  have  been  proposed7,8.  In 
Ref.7,  the  dichroic  component  is  a  plate  (or  a  beam  splitter  cube)  with  a  multilayer  coating, 
which  is  convenient  to  use,  being  a  single  optical  component.  But  it  also  has  some 
disadvantages: it operates in a limited wavelength range, its magnification factor k is a rapidly 
varying  function  of  the  incidence  angle,  and,  most  importantly,  it  exhibits  birefringence, 
which  is  also  incidence-dependent.  This  birefringence,  or  the  phase  difference 
  between 
the  two  components  of  the  electric  field  along  the  optical  axes  x  and  y  of  the  magnifier,  is 
harmful since

Ref.8, birefringence was shown to be incidence-dependent, with values up to of several tens of 
degrees.  
To  overcome  the  birefringence  problem,  one  can  use  a  pile  of  N   uncoated  glass  plates  at 
Brewster  incidence8.  This  device,  which  attenuates  the  polarization  perpendicular  (^ )  to  the 
plane  of  incidence  and  completely  transmits  the  parallel  (//)    one,  is  essentially  wavelength-
independent,  and  allows  easy  change  of  the  magnification  factor  k   by  changing  N .  At  first

However,  no  spurious  birefringence  will  appear  if  one  is  able  to  separate  spatially  and

system  of  N  plates  would  then  be  cumbersome.  Alternatively,  multiple  beams  can  easily  be 
separated  simply  by  using  wedged  plates.  This  short  paper  demonstrates  a  practical 
polarization  magnifier  with  low  birefringence  using  several  wedged  silica  plates  near

For our application9, an enhancement factor of 2-3 is desirable, which necessitates 4 or 
6  silica  plates.  The  6-plate  device  is  drawn  in  Fig. 1. Pure Herasil synthetic silica plates with 
dimensions 8.5 mm x 12 mm x 1.3 mm were cut and polished with a common wedge  a
 of 12 
arc  minutes  (3.5  mrad).  The  plates  were  cut  with  particular  care  to  minimize  stress 
birefringence10.  The  birefringence  of  each  plate  was  measured  at  normal  incidence  between 
crossed polarizers with a laser at 633 nm, and was found to be 
 2 mrad, except near the 
edges.  To  minimize any additional stress birefringence, the plates are just laid on top of each

tilted with respect to each other (see Fig. 1), so that no two surfaces were parallel. Moreover, 
a  careful  arrangement  of  the  orientation  of  the  plates  ensured  that  the  whole  dichroic  device 
did  not  translate or tilt the incident beam when inserted or removed from the laser path. The 
6-plate  device  has  a  length  of  23 mm, which is acceptable, and exhibits a net deviation of  £
 
1mrad.

However, due to the requirement that no two surfaces be parallel, exact Brewster incidence is 
not possible for all plates and this results in losses. However, as seen in Fig. 2, even for the 6-
plate  magnifier,  losses  remain  smaller  than  3%  in  a  range  of  several  degrees.  Actually, 
choosing  an  incidence  angle  slightly  above  Brewster  incidence  allows  significant  gain  in  the

Measurements  of  the  magnification  factor  were  made  by  using the two main methods 
of polarimetry, i.e., extinction between crossed polarizers and balanced mode, the latter being 
the polarimetric method used in our Parity Violation experiment11. In the first case, the device 
was  inserted  between  crossed  Glan  polarizer  and  analyzer  in  the  path  of  a  laser  beam  at 
633 nm. The  y-axis of the device was set parallel to the polarizer transmitting axis. Then the 
device  was  tilted  by   y

analyzer  needed  to  restore  extinction. We obtained  =k

mode, the device was inserted in front of a balanced-mode two-channel polarimeter12 operated 
with a 1.47 µm laser. From the ratio of the polarimeter imbalance, measured with and without 
the magnifier device and again for a tilt  y
 in the 1° range of the polarization incident on the 
6-plate  device,  we  obtained 
1.445  at 
1.47µm. Thus good agreement is found between expected and measured values of  k  and we 
have checked that this agreement also holds for a 4-plate device. Note that, in the case of our

  equal  to  15  mrad. 
This  angle  is  much  larger  than  the  typical  »
  1 mrad  divergence  of  a  laser  beam  and  thus 
allows  separation  of  the  multiply  reflected  beams  in  the  far  field.  In  our  polarimeter12,  we 
reject  the  spurious  beams  by  focussing  them  with  a  lens  of  100 mm  focal  length.  In  its  focal 
plane, the beams appear as spots separated by 1500 µm and the main beam is isolated with a 
diaphragm of 400 µm diameter before impinging on the analyzer (Fig. 3). Our balanced mode 
polarimeter  also  allows  us  to  measure  the  birefringence  of  the  6-plate  device  and  we  have 
found  : 
  0.3°.  This  is  a  real  improvement  as  compared  to  the  multilayer-coated 
device7,13,  where  the  birefringence  changed  by  4°  or  more  for  a  1°  change  of  the  angle  of 
incidence. Here the incidence is not critical.

We do not address here the general issue of the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio to be 
expected  from  the  use  of  a  polarization  magnifier,  because  it  depends  critically  on  the  noise 
characteristics  of  the  signal  to  be  measured7.  In  the  case  of  our  Parity  Violation  experiment

the  challenge  is  to  measure  to  1%  precision  a  polarization  tilt  of  the  order  of  1µrad  on  a 
pulsed  infrared  probe  laser  beam  amplified  by  stimulated  emission  in  a  pulse-excited  atomic 
cesium  vapor.  The  magnifier  has  been   decisive  in  the  substantial  improvement  we  recently 
obtained9, as compared to the 9% validation measurement11. The noise on the Parity Violation 
measurement is close to the shot-noise limit, by no means a straightforward result in a pulsed 
pump-probe experiment.

CONCLUSION 
 

We  have  shown  that  using  wedged  plates  near  Brewster  incidence, one can obtain an 
efficient  low  birefringence  polarization  magnifier.  In  particular  we  have  demonstrated  a  6-
plate  pile  which  exhibits  a  magnifying  factor 
 
lower  than  0.3°,  a  considerable  improvement  over  previous  realizations  of  a  polarization 
magnifier.  The  residual  (stress)  birefringence  could  certainly  be  reduced  by  using  larger 
plates.  The  device  has  already  proven  to  be  useful  in  increasing  the  sensitivity  of  our  Parity 
Violation measurements: in conjunction with our two-channel balanced mode polarimeter has 
allowed us to  combine the advantages of near-extinction and balanced-mode polarimetry.

A higher value of  the magnifying factor (see Fig. 4) could obviously be obtained with 
a larger number of plates provided enough care were taken over the geometrical quality of the

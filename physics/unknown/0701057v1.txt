distance of millions kilometers. The author has developed theory and made the computations. The 
method is more efficient than transmission of energy by high-frequency waves. The method may be

Introduction
Transportation of energy, matter, or impulse is very important for long period space trips especially 
for lengthy distance voyages. The spaceship crew or astronauts on planets can need additional energy 
or ship thrust. Most people think that is impossible to transfer energy a long distance in outer space 
except electromagnetic waves. Unfortunately, electromagnetic waves have a big divergence and cannot 
be used at a long distance (millions of kilometers) transfer. 
  However, the space vacuum is very good medium for offered method and special transfer of energy 
and momentum. 
  Brief history. About 40 years ago scientists received plasma flow having speed up 1000 km/s, power 
10 kW, mass consumption 0.1 g/s, electric current up million amperes. 

However, the application of plasma beam into space needs a series of inventions, innovations and 

researches. In particular, they include methods of decreasing the plasma divergence, discharging, 
dispersion of velocity, collection the plasma beam in space at long distance from source, conversion of 
the beam energy into electricity and other types of energy, conversion of plasma impulse (momentum) 
in space apparatus thrust, conversion of plasma into matter, control, etc.
  The author started this research more then forty years ago [1]. The solutions of the main noted 
problems and innovations are suggested by author in early (1982-1983) patent applications [2] - [12] 
(see also further development in [13]-[31]) and given article. In particularly, the main innovations are:

1. Using neutral plasma (not charged beam);
2. Using ultra-cool plasma or particle beam in conventional temperature;
3. Control electrostatic collector which separates and collects the ions at spaceship;
4. Control electrostatic generator which convert the ion kinetic energy into electricity;
5. Control electrostatic ramjet propulsion;
6. Special control electrostatic mirror-reflector;
7. Recombination photon engine;
8. Recombination thermo-reactor.
Research is made for conventional and relativistic particle speeds.

About 20 years ago the scientists received the ultra-cold plasma having the ion temperature lower 
then 110 -3 oK. Velocity dispersion was 10 -4  10 -6, beam divergence for conventional temperature 
was 10 -3 radian. 

If plasma accelerator is designed special for getting the ultra-cold plasma, its temperature may be 

appreciably decreased. There is no big problem in getting of cold ions from solid electrodes or cold 
electrons from solid points where molecular speed is small.

Description of innovation

  Innovative installation for transfer energy and impulse includes (fig. 1): the ultra-cold plasma 
injector, electrostatic collector, electrostatic electro-generator-thruster-reflector, and space apparatus. 
The plasma injector creates and accelerates the ultra-cold low density plasma. 
  The Installation works the following way:  the injector-accelerator forms and injects the cold neutral 
plasma beam with high speed in spaceship direction. When the beam reaches the ship, the electrostatic 
collector of spaceship collects and separates the beam ions from large area and passes them through the 
engine-electric generator or reflects them by electrostatic mirror. If we want to receive the thrust in the 
near beam direction (90o) and electric energy, the engine works as thruster (accelerator of spaceship 
and braker of beam) in beam direction and electric generator. If we want to get thrust in opposed beam 
direction, the space engine must accelerate the beam ions and spend energy. If we want to have 
maximum thrust in beam direction, the engine works as full electrostatic mirror and produces double 
thrust in the beam direction (full reflection of beam back to injector). The engine does not spend 
energy for full reflection. 
  The thrust is controlled by the electric voltage between engine nets [19], the thrust direction is 
controlled by the engine nets angle to beam direction. Note, the trust can brake the ship (decrease the 
tangential ship speed) and far ship (located out of Earth orbit) can return to the Earth by Sun gravity.
Note also, the Earth atmosphere absorbs and scatters the plasma beam and the beam injector must be 
located on Earth space mast or tower (up 40  60 km, see [20, 21]) or the Moon. Only high energy 
beam can break through atmosphere with small divergence. The advantage: the injector has a reflector 
and when the ship locates not far from the injector the beam will be reflected a lot of times and thrust 
increases in thousand times at start (fig. 2) (see same situation in [22]). 
  The proposed engine may be also used as AB-ramjet engine [19], utilizing the Solar wind or 
interstellar particles.

  The electrostatic collector and electrostatic generator-thruster-reflector proposed and described in 
[19]. The main parts are presented below.

  A Primary Ramjet propulsion engine is shown in fig.3. Such an engine can work in charged 
environment.  For example, the surrounding region of space medium contains positive charge particles 
(protons, ions). The engine has two plates 1, 2, and a source of electric voltage and energy (storage) 3. 
The plates are made from a thin dielectric film covered by a conducting layer. The plates may be a net. 
The source can create an electric voltage U and electric field (electric intensity E) between the plates. 
One also can collect the electric energy from plate as an accumulator. 

3

  The engine works in the following way. Apparatus are moving (in left direction) with velocity V (or 
particles 4 are moving in right direction). If voltage U is applied to the plates, it is well-known that 
main electric field is only between plates. If the particles are charged positive (protons, positive ions) 
and the first and second plate are charged positive and negative, respectively, then the particles are 
accelerated between the plates and achieve the additional velocity v > 0. The total velocity will be V+v
behind the engine (fig.3a). This means that the apparatus will have thrust T > 0 and spend electric 
energy W < 0 (bias, displacement current). If the voltage U = 0, then v = 0, T = 0, and W = 0 (fig.3b).
  If the first and second plates are charged negative and positive, respectively, the voltage changes sign. 
Assume the velocity v is satisfying  -V < v < 0.   Thus the particles will be braked and the engine 
(apparatus) will have drag and will also be braked. The engine transfers braked vehicle energy into 
electric (bias, displacement) current. That energy can be collected and used. Note that velocity v cannot 
equal  -V.   If  v were equal to  -V, that would mean that the apparatus collected positive particles, 
accumulated a big positive charge and then repelled the positive charged particles.
   If the voltage is high enough, the brake is the highest (fig.3d). Maximum braking is achieved when v
= -2V  (T < 0, W = 0). Note, the v cannot be more then  -2V, because it is full reflected speed.
   AB-Ramjet engine. The suggested Ramjet is different from the primary ramjet. The suggested 
ramjet has specific electrostatic collector 5 (fig. 4a,c,d,e,f,g). Other authors have outline the idea of 
space matter collection, but they did not describe the principal design of collector. Really, for charging 
of collector we must move away from apparatus the charges. The charged collector attracts the same 
amount of the charged particles (charged protons, ions, electrons) from space medium. They 
discharged collector, work will be idle. That cannot be useful.
  The electrostatic collector cannot adsorb matter (as offered some inventors) because it can adsorb 
ONLY opposed charges particles, which will be discharged the initial charge of collector. Physic law 
of conservation of charges does not allow to change charges of particles.
   The suggested collector and ramjet engine have a special design (thin film, net, special form of 
charge collector, particle accelerator). The collector/engine passes the charged particles ACROSS 
(through) the installation and changes their energy (speed), deflecting and focusing them. That is why 
we refer to this engine as the AB-Ramjet engine. It can create thrust or drag, extract energy
from the kinetic energy of particles or convert the apparatus' kinetic energy into electric energy, and 
deflect and focus the particle beam.  The collector creates a local environment in space because it 
deletes (repeals) the same charged particles (electrons) from apparatus and allows the Ramjet to work 
when the apparatus speed is close to zero. The author developed the theory of the electrostatic collector 
and published it in [23]. The conventional electric engine cannot work in usual plasma without the 
main part of the AB-engine - the special pervious electrostatic collector.

particles (protons, ions); V - speed of apparatus or particles before engine (solar wind); v - additional speed 
of particles into engine plates; T - thrust of engine; W - energy (if W < 0 we spend energy) .

  The plates of the suggested engine are different from the primary engine. They have concentric 
partitions which create additional radial electric fields (electric intensity) (fig. 4b). They straighten, 
deflect and focus the particle beams and improve the efficiency coefficient of the engine. 
  The central charge can have a different form (core) and design (fig.4 c,d,e,f,g,h). It may be:
1) a sphere (fig. 4c) having a thin cover of plastic film and a very thin (some nanometers) conducting 

layer (aluminum), with the concentric spheres inserted one into the other (fig.4d), 

2) a net formed from thin wires (fig. 4e); 
3) a cylinder (without butt-end)(fig.4f); or 
4) a plate (fig.4g). 
   The design is chosen to produce minimum energy loss (maximum particle transparency - see section 
"Theory"). The safety (from discharging, emission of electrons) electric intensity in a vacuum is 108
V/m for an outer conducting layer and negative charge. The electric intensity is more for an inside 
conducting layer and thousands of times more for positive charge.
  The engine plates are attracted one to the other (see theoretical section). They can have various
designs (fig.5a - 5d).  In the rotating film or net design (fig.5a), the centrifugal force prevents contact 
between the plates. In the inflatable design (fig. 5b), the low pressure gas prevents plate contact. A 
third design has (inflatable) rods supporting the film or net (fig. 5c). The fourth design is an inflatable 
toroid which supports the distance between plates or nets (fig. 5d).
 Note, the AB-ramjet engine can work using the neutral plasma. The ions will be accelerated or braked, 
the electrons will be conversely braked or accelerated. But the mass of the electrons is less then the 
mass of ions in thousands times and AB-engine will produce same thrust or drag.  
  Plasma accelerator.  The simplest linear plasma accelerator (principle scheme of linear particle 
accelerator) for plasma beam is presented in fig. 6. The design is a long tube (up 10 m) which creates a 
strong electric field along the tube axis (100 MV/m and more) . The accelerator consists of the tube 
with electrical isolated cylindrical electrodes, ion source, and voltage multiplier. The accelerator 
increases speed of ions, but in end of tube into ion beam the electrons are injected. This plasma 
accelerator can accelerate charged particles up 1000 MeV. Electrostatic lens and special conditions 
allow the creation of a focusing and self-focusing beam which can transfer the charge and energy long 
distances into space. The engine can be charged from a satellite, a spaceship, the Moon, or a top 
atmosphere station (space tower [21 - 22]). The beam may also be used as a particle beam weapon.
   Approximately ten years ago, the conventional linear pipe accelerated protons up to 40 MeV with a 
beam divergence of 10 -3 radian. However, acceleration of the multi-charged heavy ions may result in 
significantly more energy. 
  At present, the energy gradients as steep as 200 GeV/m have been achieved over millimeter-scale 
distances using laser pulsers. Gradients approaching 1 GeV/m are being produced on the multi-
centimeter-scale with electron-beam systems, in contrast to a limit of about 0.1 GeV/m for radio-
frequency acceleration alone. Existing electron accelerators such as SLAC 
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLAC> could use electron-beam afterburners to increase the intensity of 
their particle beams. Electron systems in general can provide tightly collimated, reliable beams while
laser systems may offer more power and compactness.
  The cool plazma beam carries three types of energy: kinetic energy of particles, ionization, and 
dissosiation energy of ions and moleculs. That carry also particle mass and momentum. The AB-
Ramjet engine (discribed over) can utilise only kinetic energy of plasma particles and momentum. The 
particles are braked and produce an electric current and thrust or reflected and produce only thrust in 
the beam direction. If we want to collect a plasma matter and to utilize also the ionization energy of 
plasma (or space invironment) ions and dissociation energy of  plasma molecules we must use the 
modified AB-Ramjet engine discribed below (fig.7).

   The modified AB-engine has magnetic collector (option), three nets (two last nets may be films), and 
issue voltage (that also may be an electric load). The voltage, U, must be enough for full braking of 
charged particles. The first two nets brake the electrons and precipitate (collect) the electrons on the 
film 2 (fig.7). The last couple of film (2, 3 in fig.7) brakes and collects the ions. The first couple of nets 
accelerate the ions that is way the voltage between them must be double.

  The collected ions and electrons have the ionized and dissociation energy. This energy is significantly 
(up 20 - 150 times) more powerful then chemical energy of rocket fuel (see Table 1) but significantly 
less then kinetic energy of particles (ions) equal U (in eV) (U may be millions volts). But that may be 
used by ship. The ionization energy conventionally pick out in photons (light, radiation) which easy 
are converted in a heat (in closed vessel), the dissociation energy conventionally pick out in heat.
  The light energy may be used in the photon engine as thrust (fig. 8a) or in a new power laser (fig.8b). 
The heat energy may be utilized conventional way (fig. 8c). The offered new power laser (fig. 8b) 
works the following way. The ultra-cool rare plasma with short period of life time located into 
cylinder. If we press it (decrease density of plasma) the electrons and ions will connect and produce 
photons of very closed energy (laser beam). If we compress very quickly by explosion the power of 
beam will be high. The power is only limited amount of plasma energy.

    If speed is relativistic, this energy is small in comparison with kinetic energy of beam. For 
interplanetary speed (VS = 8 -15 km/s) the energy of ionization reaches 15 - 50% from kinetic energy 
of beam. That decreases the coefficient of efficiency launch installation. If we used the heavy ions or a 

charged matter, the ionization energy decreases but voltage increases. For interplanetary vehicles it is 
not important because required voltage for low speed are small (U  5  20 V).

   Evidently, only high energy particle beam break up the Earth atmosphere. There is no problem if the 
particle beam starts from a space tower [20], [25] of 40  80 km altitude or from the Moon.

  Last formula in (10) allows recalculation by the particle track for any atom. For example, we want 
tocalculate the particle track for oxidizer particle having m = 16mp and energy 8,000 MeV. We take the 
Rt from Table 2 for U = 8,000/16 = 500 MeV and multiple by 16. Result Rt = 13316=2128. The 
particle track Tr = Rt/o = 2128/0.001225 =1737142 cm = 17.4 km in the air having density 1.225 
kg/m3. That is enough to break the Earth's atmosphere of the constant density 8.163 km, but the loss of 
energy will be  = 8.163/17.4 = 0.47  (47%). The divergence may also be increased by atmosphere. 
Loss and divergence may be improved is the beam station is located on a mountain or special tower 
having the height about 40  60 km .

9. Multi-reflex launch and landing (Fig.2). In a starting or braking period the thrust (braking) can be 
increasing if we use the multi-reflect method developed in [26]. Multi-reflect in launching does not 
increased the installation power (thrust is increased by increasing of efficiency), multi-reflex in braking 
converts the apparatus kinetic energy into the electric energy which can be utilized by apparatus or 
operated station. The theory of multi-reflection is described below (see also [26]).
    Change in beam power. The beam power will be reduced if one (or both) reflector is moved, 
because the beam speed changes. The total relative loss, q, of the beam energy in one double cycle 
(when the beam is moved to the reflector and back) is

q = (1–2γ)(1–2ξ)(1±2v)ς ,  q > 0 ,

(11)

where v is the loss (useful work) through relative mirror (lens) movement, v = VS/V,  VS is the relative 
speed of the electrostatic mirrors (space apparatus)[m/s], V = is the speed of the beam (in system of 
coordinates connected with an power operating station). We take the “+” when the distance is reduces 
(braking) and take “– “ when the distance is increased (as in launching, a useful work for beam), γ is 
coefficient reflectivity of electrostatic mirror (the loss of beam energy through the electrostatic 
reflector); ξ is the loss (attenuation) in the medium (air) (see point 8). If no atmosphere, ξ = 0;  ς is the 
loss through beam divergence (ς = 1 if D < Dr, where Dr is diameter of the electrostatic mirror). For a 
wire net electrostatic reflector  2dw/l where dw is diameter of wire,  l is size of mesh. For example, 
for the net having a mesh 0.10.1 m, the l = 0.1 m and a wire dw = 0.0001 m, the = 0.002 .

where S is distance between electrostatic reflectors of the station and ship [m], k = 1  1.5 is correction 
coefficient for the case when D > Dr. For primary estimation k = 1.
  If VS is small and V is high, the multi-reflex T may be large. For example, if VS =10 m/s, V = 30 km/s, 
S is small, the number of reflection may reach n  30000/10/2 = 1500 times more then regular thrust. 
That is well for ship trip starting and braking.

Limitation of reflection number. If the reflector is moved away, the maximum number of reflections, 

N, is limited by q > 0, VS < 0.5V (see Eq. (11)). At ship launch or braking the maximum thrust is 
limited by a safety acceleration or deceleration.
   Coefficient of efficiency. The propulsion efficiency coefficient, η, (without loss for ionization) may

10. Macro-particle beam and projectile.  The developed theory may be applied to any macro-particle 
beam or projectiles. An electrostatic gun may be used for its acceleration [27]. The projectile has a 
charge which is lost after it exits   the gun (charged energy will be returned to installation).  There is no
big problem with flight through the Earth atmosphere for projectiles. The loss energy is about 10 -
20%, the heat is small if projectile has a sharp tip (see [21], [24]). The ship uses a kinetic energy of 
projectile and projectile matter as described in [29, 30].
  The offered method may be applied vareiouly. We consider only application to interplanetary 
spaceship and interstellar space probe.

Project 1
(interplanetary spaceship having weight 3 tons and speed 12 km/s,)

  Assume we want to estimate the parameters of an interplanetary manned spaceship for Moon and 
Mars having weight of 3 tons and a final speed 12 km/s started from Moon, Mars, or Earth's tower 
having height of 80 km. We use the theory beam reflection, Figs. 20 - 22 and find the estimation time, 
thrust, speed, distance. The trained astronauts can stand the overload 8g.

19

  The request power for beam flow 1, 2, 3 kg/s are  312, 625, 937 MW respectively. Power for 
ionization are 127, 254, 391 MW respectively. That is power of a middle electric station.

Project 2
(interstellar probe having speed 30.000 km/s, weight 100 kg)
  Let us assume we want to estimate an interstellar probe which can reach the nearest solar systems. As 
known they are located about 3 - 4 light years from our Sun. That means the apparatus having speed S
= 0.1c  (VS = 30,000 km/s) can reach them in 30 - 40 years. Remander, "Voyager-1" was flown for 30+ 
year, sending information up to present time. But it has speed only 20 km/s and was reached only the 
boundary of Solar system (about 2 billions km).
 Assume, the weight of interstellar probe is 100 kg. If distance of acceleration is S = 31013 m (200 
AU) the acceleration and acceleration time must be

 Here S = 0  0.1 . We take the average value S = 0.05 . Notice that PB = P, that means our

high. Tens of electric power stations must accelerate this probe in 23 days. We cannot decrease this 
amount by any methods because that is a minimum energy required by space probe.

  In given case (comparison with PB above) this value is small and we can negligee it. But into

Discussion
  In [34] G.A. Landis writes about using particle beams for interstellar flight. The beam is braked by a 
magnetic sail. Unfortunately, as with most other works in this field, his work also contains only 
common speculations. No theory, no mathematical models, no computations. More then ten years 
authors investigate the magnetic sail, but not its theory, no formulas which allows correct calculation
or to estimate the magnetic sail drug. Landis offered the beam temperature 45 oK. The theory in this 
article is shown that this temperature gives the beam divergence which does not allows the interstellar 
flights. Absolutely unsubstantiated statement that magnetic sail reflects beam in thousands kilometers 

20

diameter. The estimations shows for high speed particles especially relativistic particles the affective 
diameter equals some meters and magnetic field must be powerful. In additional the magnetic sail is 
impossible at present time: electric ring needs in cryogenic temperature and spaceship must have 
power cryogenic equipment because the Sun will warm the ring for any heat insulation; for starting the 
ring needs a power electric station; a special equipment is necessary for displacing the ring of 100 km 
diameter into space; if the ring temperature exceeds a critical cryogenic temperature in any ring place, 
the ring explodes. The ring weight is big (22 tons for diameter 100 km), the produced magnetic field is 
very weak (10-6 Tesla). The magnetic sail does not have active control. That means the ship will move
in one (non-control) direction and a ship mission will useless. These obvious defects makes impossible 
the application of the magnetic sail with little or no progress in solution these problems since 1988.
 The suggested method does not require a magnetic sail. That used the electrostatic sail [27] and AB-
Ramjet engine offered by author early. This sail is light (100 - 300 kg), cheap, and has tens kilometers 
(hundreds km for low beam density) of the effective radius. For example, for solar wind the magnetic 
effective radius decreases proportional 1/R2 (where R is distance of the sail from the Sun), electrostatic 
effective radius decreases approximately 1/R (see [27]). That is very important advantage.
  

Conclusion
  The offered idea and method use the AB-Ramjet engine suggested by author in 1982 [3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 
14 - 16, 18]  and detail developed in [19]. The installation contains an electrostatic particle collector 
suggested in 1982 and detail developed in [27, 31]. The propulsion-reflected system is light net from 
thin wire, which can have a large area (tens km) and allows to control thrust and thrust direction 
without turning of net (Fig.5). This new method uses the ultra-cold full neutral relativistic plasma and 
having small divergence. The method may be used for acceleration space apparatus (up relativistic 
speed) for launch and landing Space apparatus to small planets (asteroids, satellites) without 
atmosphere. For Earth offered method will be efficiency if we built the tower (mast) about 40  80 km 
height [20, 25]. At present time that is the most realistic method for relativistic probe.

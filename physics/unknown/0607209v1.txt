Abstract 

It  is  argued  here  that  the  Copenhagen  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics  violates  the  tenets  on  which 

both Galileo’s and Einstein’s theories of relativity are based. It is postulated that the “building blocks” of 

the universe are not particles but are holistic wave-entities which act and interact with other wave-entities 

as  one  would  expect  from  waves:  i.e.  they  can  change  their  shape  and  spatial  extent  (morph)  when  the 

boundary  conditions  change,  and  they  can  superpose  when  sharing  the  same  region  of  space.  It  is 

concluded  that  there  are  two  distinctly  different  ways  in  which  superposition  can  occur:  (i)  the  holistic 

waves can  add without  totally losing their separate identities so that the superposed wave can experience 

interactions between its sub-components (it is suggested that this process should be termed “enmeshment”); 

(ii) the holistic waves can add to completely lose their separate holistic identities in order to form a wave 

which  is  again  a  single  holistic  entity  (it  is  suggested  that  this  process  be  termed  “entanglement”).  A 

parameter is derived which defines an interface between quantum mechanics and classical mechanics: the 

one does not encompass the other; both are valid within their respective domains. Using this framework, a 

possible  causal  interpretation  is  developed  for  quantum  mechanics  which  can  be  visualised;  even  the 

“spooky  action  at  a  distance”  that  worried  Einstein  so  much,  seems  to  follow  logically.  This  analysis 

suggests  a  new  approach  to  model  the  electron  (and other  fundamental  particles)  quantum-mechanically. 

The  electromagnetic  quantum-energy  of  a  solitary  electron  does  not  form  a  field  around  the  electron  in 

three-dimensional space, but is finite and localised so that it is equal to the mass of the electron. An energy 

component along the fourth dimension is derived for the electron which could be part of the dark energy of 

the  Universe  and  which,  in  turn,  causes  vacuum-energy  fluctuations  through  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty 

relationship for energy and time. The possible consequences of this approach are analysed and discussed.

General relativity explains big things, quantum mechanics explains little things, and if the twain meets it 

is on a scale that is physically undetectable and hence empirically irrelevant. 

Freeman Dyson as quoted in New Scientist 

The  unpredictable,  random  element  comes  in  only  when  we  try  to  interpret  the  wave  in  terms  of  the 

positions and velocities of particles. But maybe that is our mistake: maybe there are no particle positions 

and velocities of particles, but only waves. 

Stephen Hawking in “A Brief History of Time” 

Notwithstanding  opposition  from  formidable  scientists  like Einstein,  Schrödinger,  de Broglie  and  Bohm, 

the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics still reigns supreme after its inception 80 years ago. It 

is at present generally believed that realism in science has been defeated; the quantum world does not exist 

unless one looks  for  it,  and  in  this process  one  becomes  a  creator  of  the  “reality”  one  experiences.  This 

interpretation  rests  primarily  on  two  principles  postulated  by  Born  and  Heisenberg,  and  further 

“rationalised”  by  Bohr  when  he  formulated  his  principle  of  complementarity  according  to  which  the 

particle and wave behaviour are two aspects of the same “reality” which cannot manifest simultaneously: 

(i) 

According to Born the intensity of the wave-function, derived from the Schrödinger equation, 

is  not  the  intensity  of  a  “real  matter  wave”  but  a  probability  distribution  representing  the 

spread in possible positions at which a quantum particle (like an electron) will be found when 

a measurement is made. 

(ii) 

According  to  Heisenberg  there  are  inbuilt  uncertainties  in  nature.  When,  for  example, 

measuring position and momentum, uncertainties must appear  even if perfect measurements 

were  possible;  i.e.  in  terms  of  Planck’s reduced constant there  exists  along  any  direction in 
space a relationship between the uncertainty ∆r in position and ∆p in momentum of a particle; 

 

 

 

 
≥∆∆ pr

½ h  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

 

 

 

 
  
This relationship implies that the product of ∆r with ∆p can at best be equal to ½ h . In terms 
of the Born-interpretation, it implies that an accurate measurement of the position of a particle 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

along the direction r, must lead to an infinitely large uncertainty in the momentum and vice-

namely  

 

 

 

 

versa.

These two principles logically lead to the conclusion that the position and momentum of a quantum particle 

cannot  manifest  in  such  a  way  that  both  can  be  measured  or  known  simultaneously,  and  that  repeated 

measurements  of  any  one  of  these  parameters  under  exactly  the  same  physical  conditions  give  different 

results  for  each  measurement;  i.e.  “God  plays  dice!”.  The  Copenhagen  interpretation  has  become 

entrenched in the scientific world. In fact, it has become dangerous to advocate an objective reality for the 

quantum world. It is nowadays widely believed that  if one  attempts to do so, it  implies that one does not 

“understand” quantum physics. 

 

In 1935 Einstein took a “last stand” against the Copenhagen interpretation when he, Podolsky and 

Rosen formulated their (EPR) paradox [1]. The experiment is based on the concept of  “entanglement” of 

particles.  Schrödinger  coined  the  term  “entanglement”  when  particles  are  represented  by  a  single  multi-

particle  wave-function.  It  implies  an  instantaneous  “understanding”  between  the  particles  when  they  are 

modelled  by  quantum  mechanics;  a  “spooky  action  at  a  distance”.  Einstein  et  al  pointed  out  that  this 

implies  that  two  “entangled”  particles  separated  by  light  years  must  still  be  able  to  communicate 

instantaneously with each other when a measurement is made on one of them. The other particle must then 

“immediately” manifest an outcome that  is determined by the outcome of  the measurement on its partner 

light years away. Einstein et al reasoned that (according to Einstein’s theory of relativity) faster-than-light 

communication is not possible between two such particles, and therefore the instantaneous communication 

required by entanglement must indicate that the theory of quantum mechanics is incomplete. In 1964 John 

Bell  derived  a  condition  that  has  to  be  violated  if  such  instantaneous  communication  can  manifest  [2]. 

Subsequent experiments on entangled photons violated Bell’s inequality [3]. This has led to the conclusion 

that “Einstein has been proved wrong”; our universe is indeed the bizarre, non-causal, statistical concoction 

portrayed by the Copenhagen interpretation. 

In  this  publication  it  will  be  argued  that  the  Copenhagen  interpretation  violates  fundamental 

relativistic concepts (from Galileo to Einstein), and that this has led to the present conundrums in physics; 

i.e. when a quantum “particle” with mass is analysed within its correct relativistic context it is found that a 

causal interpretation for quantum mechanics must apply. 

When  talking  about  relativity  Einstein’s  name  immediately  comes  to  mind;  however,  the  real  father  of 

relativity is Galileo. He was first to consider the implications when bodies move relative to one another. He 

concluded that there is no mechanical experiment that one can do to determine whether you (the observer) 

and the “stationary surroundings” you observe around you are moving or not moving with a constant speed. 

From this he postulated that the earth is moving and nearly lost his life for parting with accepted scientific 

2. Relativity 

dogma. 

Galileo’s conclusions about  relativity  later  became  formalised  in  Newton’s  first  law  of classical 

mechanics. For the purposes of this publication, Newton’s first law will be restated as follows: a body with 

mass  that  moves  with  a  constant  velocity  is  a  “stationary  body”;  this  is  so  because  one  can  attach  a 

 

 

 

 

4 

reference  frame  to  such  a  body  (its  proper  reference  frame)  within  which  it  will  be  observed  as  being 

stationary and within which, according to Galileo, it will act like a “real” stationary body. The body’s mass 

can then be interpreted as its “inertia”; i.e. its “resistance against being moved” from its stationary position 

within  its  proper  reference  frame.  It  is  well-known  that  it  is  for  this  reason  that  reference  frames  which 

move with constant velocities relative to each other have become known as “inertial” reference frames. The 

fact that a body with mass which moves with a constant velocity can be considered as stationary, does not 

exclude  the  possibility  that  there might be  a  unique  stationary  reference  frame  in  the universe relative to 

which all other inertial reference frames move. For years it has been believed that the ether, within which 

light waves supposedly had  to manifest and which on its own must thus be a static medium  that  fills the 

whole  universe,  can  serve  as  such  a  reference  frame;  however,  the  failure  of  the  Michelson-Morley 

experiment to detect the movement of the earth relative to the ether, and the derivation by Maxwell of his 

famous electromagnetic wave equations led Einstein to postulate that such a special inertial reference frame 

does not exist. 

 

In  his  special  theory  of  relativity  Einstein  amended  Galilean  relativity  by  postulating  that  all 

inertial  reference  frames are equivalent,  and  that  there is no  experiment possible,  even  when  using  light, 

which an observer can use to prove that his/her stationary surroundings are moving or not! This forced him 

to further postulate that the speed of light must be the same within whichever inertial reference frame it is 

measured. It is accepted in the scientific literature today that light consists of photons (“particles”), and that 

a photon does not have mass. According to the discussion above, this is exactly as it has to be. If a photon 

had  mass,  it  would  have  been  able  to  resist  being  moved  from  a  stationary  position  within  an  inertial 

reference frame; i.e. a photon can therefore not have a proper inertial reference frame within which it can 

be at rest. As is well known, two major consequences of these postulates by Einstein are (i) that time relates 

to a fourth dimension of the universe and (ii) that mass is the same as energy; i.e. 

 

 

 

E =

2mc

3. Time-independent wave-functions of an electron 

It is well known that Schrödinger’s time-dependent equation for an electron can be written as: 

(Hψ r,t)

The symbols have their usual meaning. H is the Hamilton operator which is interpreted as the sum of  the 

kinetic energy and potential energy in operator format; i.e.

In other words the momentum operator can be written as p

. When the potential energy V(r,t) of the 

∇−= i

electron  does not  change  with time,  so that V(r,t)=V(r), the  solution  of  the  equation renders  a  complete 

basis-set of wave-functions where each has a definite energy En enumerated by a quantum number or a set 

of quantum numbers. The quantum numbers are determined by the boundary conditions defined by V(r). In 

general, when these wave-functions are localised, in the sense that they primarily occupy a small region in 

space, the differences between consecutive energies are large; when the wave-functions spread over large 

regions  in  space,  these  differences  become  smaller.  Each  one  of  these  wave-functions  can  be  written  in 

terms of its concomitant energy En as:

The total intensity In of the wave can then be calculated by integrating over the region of space which the 

wave occupies; i.e. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

where  τd  is an infinitesimal volume at the point denoted by the position vector r. If, as postulated by Born, 

the  wave-intensity  represents  a  probability  distribution,  then  In  is  the  probability  of  finding  the  electron 

anywhere  “within the wave” and therefore  In must be equal to unity. The resultant wave-intensity of any 

one  of  the  basis-solutions  is  completely  time-independent  provided  that  the  potential  energy  does  not 

change in any way. It must be emphasised that such a stationary wave does not imply the same state as, for 

example,  a  stationary  wave  on  a  violin  string.  The  latter  wave  is  a  superposition  of  waves  that  move  in 

opposite directions along the string. In this case the resultant superposed wave still changes with time; i.e. 

the  string  still  vibrates.  In the  case of  a single-electron stationary-wave  there  is  no change  whatsoever at 

any point in space with time. Thus, for example, the intensity of the wave representing an electron-orbital 

around  the  nucleus  of  an  atom  does  not  oscillate  with  time  like  a  standing  wave  on  a  string.  But  if  the 

wave-intensity  is  unchangingly  stationary  in  space,  what  is  it  stationary  relative  to?  Must  it  not  be 

stationary  relative  to  a  proper  inertial  reference  frame?  Relative  to  another  inertial  reference  frame  the 

position vectors r referencing the points within the wave will have to change with time. The wave will then 

be observed as a moving wave; i.e. it will change with time! 

6 

 

Each  one  of  the  stationary  basis  wave-functions  can  represent  an  electron  which,  owing  to  its 

postulated  “probabilistic wave-nature”, is interpreted to have uncertainties  in its position and momentum. 

As  already  pointed  out  above  (according  to  the  Copenhagen  interpretation)  the  uncertainty-spread  in 

position gives the spectrum of possible positions that are able to manifest when a position measurement is 

made,  while  the  uncertainty-spread  in  momentum  gives  the  spectrum  of  possible  momentums  that  can 

manifest when, instead, the momentum of the same electron is measured. But if this is the case, does it not 

imply  that  the  electron  constituting  an  atomic  orbital  must  be  “moving  around  within”  such  an  orbital 

relative to the positive charge on the nucleus. If it is not “moving around” one should find it exactly at the 

same position and with zero momentum every time when making the same position measurement. The only 

“logical”  argument  (consistent  with  the  Copenhagen  interpretation)  to  prevent  this  conclusion  is  to 

postulate  that  the  electron  is  not  really  there  until  one  does  the  measurement!  But  what  is  then  there? 

Electrons are, for example, responsible for forming covalent bonds and must thus be “there” for the bond to 

keep on manifesting even when one is not making a measurement to determine the position of any one of 

the  two  electrons.  Thus,  when  applying  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  relationship  (as  interpreted  by 

Heisenberg) to such a bond, one again has to conclude that the two electrons are moving about. But when 

charges  move  relative  to  each  other,  Maxwell’s equations  demand  that  electromagnetic waves  should  be 

radiating. So why does this not happen? 

It is now proposed here that the latter problem should be removed by postulating that the electron 

is the time-independent wave intensity of the orbital; i.e. the electron is not a particle with a point charge 

and an uncertainty in its position and momentum, but the electron is in this case a “localised” field within 

which  its  charge  is  “smeared  out”  within the  wave  intensity;  i.e.  the  wave-field  is  a  holistic single-entity 

which is distributed over a region of space. “Localised” in this sense implies that the stationary, “smeared-

out” charge-intensity has a centre of charge around which the charge is distributed within a relatively small 

volume. If this stationary-distributed charge is the reality instead of a particle with a point charge, then its 

concomitant  charge distribution is completely stationary relative  to the other charges which are sharing a 

proper inertial  reference  frame with  it;  e.g.  the  positive  charge  of the  nucleus. Therefore  electromagnetic 

waves cannot radiate. This viewpoint also implies that “the electron” must be in “immediate contact” with 

itself over the space-volume it occupies; i.e. time cannot exist “within” such a holistic single wave-entity. 

But what about a “free electron” which is moving through space far away from any other charges? 

Can this entity be  interpreted as  a  localised wave with a centre of charge instead of being a point-charge 

4. Traditional modelling of a “free” electron 

One might want to argue that it is a waste of time to model a free electron in terms of Schrödinger’s “non-

relativistic” equation. It would be better to use Dirac’s equation. For reasons that will become clear we will 

start off with Schrödinger, and comment later on Dirac’s equation (see section 14.2). 

particle? 

 

 

7 

In  all  textbooks  the  basis-solutions  of  the  Schrödinger  equation  for  a  free  electron  gives 

“extended”  solutions;  i.e.  the  wave-intensity  of  such  a  wave  is  not  localised.  These  wave-functions  are 

obtained  from  the  Schrödinger  equation  by  setting  the  potential  energy  V(r,t)  of  the  electron  identically 

equal to zero; i.e. the potential energy of the electron does not change with time or position. It is then found 

that the resultant basis functions are given by: 

 

 

 

ψ r,t)
(n

=

Cn

exp[

(i

kn•r

ω−

)]tn

 

 

The  different  values  of  kn  are  the  appropriate  wave  vectors  of  these  complex  wave-functions.  The 

probability distribution for such a wave follows as: 

 

 

 

 

(8) 

(9) 

ρ r,t)
(n

ψ=

(n

r,t)*

ψ r,t)
(n

nC=

2

   

When normalising the intensity by integration it is found that all the basis functions have the same constant 

intensity over all space, and that each one of these “probability” distributions is stationary over the whole 

universe. The question to  ask is: stationary relative to which inertial reference  frame? Do these  functions 

not  require  a  unique,  universal,  stationary  inertial  reference  frame?  I  believe  that  they  do,  because  the 

electron  is  modelled  as  if  there  is  no other  matter present  in the  universe. Such  a  reference  frame  is  not 

possible according to Einstein’s theories of relativity. So is it reasonable to accept that these solutions can 

manifest?  Furthermore,  in  terms  of  the  statistical  interpretation  of  the  wave-function  (as  postulated  by 

Born)  it  will  be  near  impossible,  if  not  totally  impossible,  to  find  a  “free”  electron  in  the  universe. 

Experimentally this is not the case. Experimental evidence must reign supreme. So what is wrong? 

The traditional method used in textbooks to “make this problem go away”, is not to normalise the 

intensities of the wave-functions but to superpose them in order to form a localised wave “packet”; which is 

then normalised. This can be done by summing over all the allowed wave-functions; the localised wave is 

then generated by having a suitable distribution in the values of Cn for different values of kn. Since the basis 

waves  are  spread  over  the  whole  universe,  the  increments  in  energy  (and  thus  the  wave  vectors)  can  be 

taken as near-continuous so that a wave packet can be written as a Fourier-integral: i.e. 

 

 

 

ψ (r,t)

The Cn’s have been replaced with the continuous function φ(k,t) in wave-vector space. Thus knowing this 
function, one can derive the wave-function ψ(r,t). Alternatively when knowing the wave-function one can 

derive the concomitant function in k-space from the following, inverse Fourier-integral:

∞−

 
φ(k,t) is also a “wave packet” which, however, manifests in wave vector space (k-space). At any time t, say 

t=0, one can calculate the spread in position ∆r of the intensity of the wave packet along a chosen direction, 

and also the concomitant spread in the wave vector ∆k along the same direction using the intensity of the 

wave  packet  in  k-space;  i.e.  this  is  done  by  making  use  of  the  functions  ψ(r,0)  and  φ(k,0) respectively. 

Owing to the inverse relationship between the two Fourier-integrals it is found that the product ∆r∆k can 

never be zero. The smallest number (they can be equal to) is found when ψ(r,0) has a Gaussian shape along 

the direction r. It is then found that φ(k,0) also has a Gaussian shape along the same direction. In this case 

one has that: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(12) 

1=∆∆ kr
2

 

Thus  if  the  average  spread  of  the  wave  intensity  along  a  direction  in  position  space  is  large,  then  the 

average spread along the same direction of the wave intensity in k-space must be small and vice versa. This 

is reminiscent of Heisenberg’s uncertainty relationship (see Eq. (1)). In fact, it is reasoned in textbooks that 

this  forms  the basis for  the Heisenberg relationship and the statistical interpretation of the wave-function. 

According to de Broglie’s hypothesis, the momentum of an electron is proportional to the wave vector: i.e. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(13) 

= k 

p h

 

 
Thus by writing  for ∆p

k∆=
h

, Eq. (13) becomes Eq. (1). The following problem, however, still remains: 

relative  to  which  inertial  reference  frame  is  such  a  wave  packet  described?  The  solution  still  requires  a 

uniquely stationary reference frame for the basis functions and thus also for the wave packet; and this does 

not  exist.  Furthermore,  the  Schrödinger equation  describes  “an electron”.  So each  possible  solution  must 

represent “an electron”. Thus a wave packet  can only be generated by superposing waves,  each of which 

represents  an  electron.  It  is  known  (and  fits  experiment)  that  it  is  possible  within  a  conducting  solid 

material  to  superpose  extended  (so-called  delocalised)  valence-electron  waves  in  order  to  form  a  wave 

packet. Although the resultant wave-packet (or excitation) can under suitable circumstances act very much 

like a single electron, it is not one; therefore it is referred to as a pseudo-particle. Does it then make sense to 

construct  an  actual  electron  in  free  space  in  the  same  manner?  It  seems  unlikely.  In  addition,  when 

constructing such a wave packet, the exponential, energy-time factors (see Eq. (10)) have to be included. It 

is then found that such a wave packet, when left to its own devices, spreads out in space with time; i.e. the 

uncertainty in the position of the electron increases with time. Has this ever been observed experimentally 

for an electron in free space? Not that I know off! So why do scientists believe this model?

5. The “path” of an electron in space 

The accepted quantum-mechanical model for a free electron in space (discussed in section 4) is at variance 

with what is known experimentally about electrons. Electrons were discovered as cathode rays and they do 

not become “uncertain” once they are ejected from a cathode. In fact they follow well defined paths which 

can be accurately modelled by means of classical mechanics. It is this behaviour of electrons that convinced 

Born  that  “particles”  are  the  reality  and  that  the  wave-function’s  intensity  should  be  interpreted  as  a 

probability  distribution;  however,  to  model  the  path  classically,  both  the  position  and  momentum  of  the 

centre of mass of an electron must be specified at each instance in time. This is not possible according to 

Heisenberg’s  interpretation  of  his  uncertainty  relationship.  Heisenberg  addressed  this  problem  by  the 

following statement: “I believe that the existence of the classical “path” can be pregnantly formulated as 

follows: The “path” comes into existence only when we observe it”. This implies that the quantum world 

“magically” becomes the classical world when an observer is present. “Suddenly” it is possible to violate 

Heisenberg’s own interpretation of his uncertainty relationship for position and momentum! 

How  can  one  observe  the  path  if  it  is  not  possible  to  simultaneously  observe  the  position  and 

momentum  of  the  electron?  One  possibility  (and  probably  the  only  one)  would  be  to  conclude  that  the 

position  and  momentum  manifest  sequentially:  i.e.  one  first  observes  the  position,  then  the  momentum, 

then again the position, etc. But when, for example, observing the position of the particle, then, according 

to  the  Copenhagen  interpretation,  the  momentum  becomes  indeterminate;  when  next  observing  the 

momentum, any momentum from a spectrum of possible momentums might manifest. Similarly when next 

again observing the position, any position out of a spectrum of possible positions might manifest. In other 

words,  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  electron  will  increase  and  decrease  erratically  and  its  position  will  also 

jump around erratically; i.e. the “path” of the electron should be akin to Brownian motion. There is not a 

single experimental result that shows such behaviour for an electron when it moves through free space. If 

this  were  the  reality,  there  would  not  be  operational  electron  microscopes  or  electron  accelerators. 

Furthermore, such random jumps in energy violate the conservation of energy; where does the energy come 

from or go to each time when the momentum changes statistically? 

One  must  always  be  led  by  experimental  results.  As  already  mentioned  above,  there  exists  no 

doubt that the path of an electron (or at least its centre of mass) in free space can be accurately modelled by 

specifying both the position of its centre of mass and its momentum  at  the same  time. These calculations 

have been accurately consistent with all experiments done to date. As discussed in section 2, a particle with 

mass  that  moves  with  a  constant  velocity  must  be  stationary  within  its  proper  inertial  reference  frame 

moving  with  it.  A  free  electron  with  no  forces  on  it  can  be  accurately  modelled  as  a  particle  moving 

through space with a constant velocity; in fact, it must be so because the electron has mass. As discussed in 

section  2,  mass  is  the resistance  of  a particle  against  being moved  from its  stationary  position  within  its 

proper  inertial  reference  frame.  Since  the  electron  must  be  stationary  within  its  proper  inertial  reference 

10

frame and since such a reference frame moves relative to other inertial reference frames, it must always be 

possible to simultaneously specify both the position and momentum of the centre of mass of a free electron 

relative  to  any  inertial  reference  frame.  If  this  reasoning  is  correct,  it  means  that  the  Copenhagen 

interpretation must be wrong. This, in turn, means that Heisenberg’s uncertainty relationship cannot have 

anything  to  do  with  uncertainties  in  the  position  and  momentum  of  a  particle.  It  requires  another 

explanation. 

 

6. Heisenberg’s “uncertainty” relationship 

A  photon’s  wave  vector  k  always  corresponds  to  the  photon’s  momentum  through  the  de  Broglie 

relationship (Eq. (13)). Therefore, if there is an uncertainty in its wave vector, this must correspond to an 

uncertainty  in  its  momentum.  But  the  photon  always  moves  with  the  same  speed  relative  to  all  inertial 

reference  frames.  This  is  not  the  case  for  a  particle  with  mass.  Consider  a  time-independent,  localised 

matter-wave  within  its  proper  reference  frame.  Does  the  uncertainty  in  the  wave  vector  of  the  time-

independent stationary field relate to momentum in this case? I cannot see how this is possible, because the 

momentum only comes into play when an electron moves relative to an inertial reference frame. Thus the 

relative  speed with which  the proper inertial reference frame of the electron moves relative to the one in 

which  the  observer  finds  him/herself  determines  the  applicable  de  Broglie  wavelength  that  relates  to  an 

actual momentum. 

 

Consider, for example, a sinusoidal matter-wave travelling along a single direction in space and an 

observer travelling with it. According to the observer the wave-intensity will not change with time in any 

way  or  manner;  thus  it  cannot  have  momentum.  In  contrast,  any  observer  moving  relative  to  the  proper 

reference  frame  within  which  the  wave  is  stationary  will  attest  to  the  fact  that  the  wave  can  transfer 

momentum,  and that this momentum is directly proportional to the speed with which the observer moves 

relative to the matter-wave’s proper inertial reference frame. Thus Heisenberg’s uncertainty relationship for 

a  time-independent  stationary  wave  cannot  have  anything  to  do  with  the  wave’s  actual  momentum  as 

measured  by  an  observer  travelling  relative  to  the  stationary  wave.  All  that  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty 

relationship can imply is that when the wave gets “squeezed” in position space, as referenced relative to the 

wave’s  inertial  reference  frame,  it  will  expand  in  the  concomitant k-space and vice versa. It  will  now  be 

argued that this gives an additional reason why an electron can be modelled as a wave-intensity under all 

circumstances.  Owing to  the ability  of  the  wave  intensity  to “stretch  and  squeeze” it  can  manifest  as  an 

extended (delocalised)  wave within  a solid  while  “collapsing”  to  form  a localised  wave-intensity  outside 

the  solid.  This  is  so  simply  because  the  boundary  conditions  (experienced  by  the  wave)  change;  it  has 

nothing  to  do  with  “implicate  magic”  or  “wave-particle”  duality.  Thus  the  change  in  the  wave-function 

when  the  potential  energy  is  time-dependent  (see  Eq.  (3))  does  not  necessarily  describe  movement  of  a 

particle, but the morphing of the wave in shape and size. It can, for example, morph relative to its proper 

inertial reference frame without changing the position of its centre of mass. In such a case the wave remains 

stationary  relative  to  its  proper  reference  frame.  When  suitable  boundary  conditions  are  encountered 

 

11

(changes in the applicable potential energy) it might, however, also be able to morph in such a way that its 

centre of mass (and thus its centre of charge) accelerates. It will then start to manifest momentum relative 

to its original proper inertial reference frame. 

There  is  now,  however,  another  serious  question:  why  will  an  electron  wave  become  localised 

when it enters free space? Does this mean that it forms a wave packet as had been modelled in section 4? If 

it does form such a wave packet, why does it do so? Furthermore, even if it does start off as a wave packet, 

the packet should immediately start spreading. As already pointed out in section 5 this is at variance with 

all experimental data collected on the free electron. If the electron is a wave, then it must become localised 

when it is ejected from the material in order to act as a “particle” and keep on acting as a particle while it is 

in free space. To do this,  there must be a suitable change  in the boundary conditions which the electron-

wave experiences when it enters free space. 

7. Free electron localisation 

The  indications  are  strong  that  a  wrong  assumption  has  been  made  consistently  through  the  years  when 

modelling the quantum-mechanical nature of a single electron moving through free space. What could this 

be?  In  contrast,  it  has  been  consistently  found  that  the  Schrödinger  equation  gives  eminently  reasonable 

answers when applied to all other situations where the electron is confined to, or bound to remain within a 

smaller region in space. The mistake that could have been made is most probably the assumption that the 

potential  energy  of  a  free  electron  is  zero.  This  is  correct  when  using  classical  mechanics;  but  is  it  also 

correct when quantum mechanics applies? According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, mass is energy. So 

is this not an indication that a free stationary electron experiences potential energy? As argued in section 2, 

mass is a measure of the resistance of such a particle against moving from its stationary position within its 

proper inertial  reference  frame.  This  implies  that  there  could be  an  “opposing  force”  coming  into  action 

when the electron “tries” to move from its stationary position; i.e. the electron is experiencing a minimum 

potential energy. What could be the cause of this?  

 

As  postulated  in  section 3 an  atomic  electron is a time-independent  holistic localised  wave  that 

forms around the nucleus. It morphs to form such an entity because of the presence of the positive charge 

on the nucleus. The logic of the reasoning above indicates that a ‘free” electron must also be a stationary, 

localised,  time-independent wave-entity, or else  it cannot be stationary within its proper inertial reference 

frame as is required for a particle with mass. It thus seems that there must be “some sort of positive charge” 

involved  that  “kicks-in”  when  the  electron  attempts  to  move  from  its  stationary  position.  It  will  thus  be 

postulated that such a charge can manifest and that this could, should and most probably must account for 

the mass of the electron. 

Consider a solitary, stationary electron situated at the origin of its proper inertial reference frame. 

It is now postulated that when it attempts to move from the origin, a “virtual” positive charge appears that 

exerts  a  restoring  force  on  the  electron.  It  will  be  assumed  that  the  space  surrounding  the  electron  is 

isotropic  so  that  the  same  force  will  manifest  along  any  radial  direction.  Thus  if  the  electron  moves  a 

 

 

 

12

distance r from the origin, there will be a virtual positive charge q(r) so that the restoring force F(r) can be 

calculated from Coulomb’s law as: 

The  functional  dependence  of 

)r(ρ

  is  not  known.  Thus  a  constant  average  value  ρ   will  be  assumed  to 

apply so that Eq. (15) becomes: 

According  to Gauss’  law  an electron at a radial position r  should experience  the same  force  whether  the 

virtual charge is a point charge q(r) at the origin, or whether the virtual charge is radially distributed with a 

density

 within a sphere of radius r centred at the origin. One can thus calculate q(r) from

It should be noted that exactly the same potential-energy well will manifest for a positron within its proper 

inertial reference frame. In this case the virtual charge will be negative. Intuitively it is a very satisfactory 

result  that  the  inertia  of  an  electron  (or  positron)  relates  to  being bound  quantum-mechanically  within  a 

harmonic  potential  well;  however,  this  has  been  obtained  at  the  cost  of  postulating  a  virtual  charge  that 

appears “magically” from nowhere. Is there a mechanism that can explain the existence of such a charge? 

In physics it is customary to first solve simpler problems and then to extrapolate in order to find solutions 

to more complex ones. Many  times a solution is first sought at lower dimensions. In  the present case  the 

potential  well  is  three-dimensional.  A  similar  problem  in  two  dimensions,  which  relates  to  n-type 

semiconductors [4], will thus be considered next. 

8. A two-dimensional analogue 

In a perfect n-type semiconductor all the conduction electrons are supplied by donor centres. It is believed 

that  in large  band-gap  insulators  like diamond  the conduction  band could have  a  higher  energy  than  the 

vacuum level outside the material. It has also been surmised that if such a material can be doped n-type it 

could  form  an  ideal  cold  cathode.  It  might  even be possible  that  the  energy  levels  of such  donor  centres 

could  also  be  above  the  vacuum  level.  Nonetheless,  whether  the  energy  level  of  the  donors  is  above  or 

below  the  vacuum  level,  this  energy  is  the  lowest  energy  a  conduction  electron  can  have  within  such  a 

material. 

 
Consider an n-type semiconductor substrate with an idealised large flat abrupt surface. The depth 
of  the  conduction  band  energy  below  the  vacuum  level  is  given  by  the  electron  affinity  (χ);  usually 

measured  in  eV.  Assume  that  a  conduction  electron  gains  enough  energy  to  scale  the  latter  barrier  and 

move away from the substrate with a speed v. Polarisation below the surface of the substrate will generate 

an image charge which attracts the electron back towards the substrate. The electron decelerates and loses 

all its kinetic energy (some by radiating electromagnetic waves) until it, momentarily, comes to rest having 

only potential energy. The electron finds itself in the electric field of its image charge and will thus be at a 

lower potential energy than the vacuum level, which now has to be measured at infinity. The image force 

will then accelerate the electron back towards the substrate. This implies that the electron will be gaining 

kinetic  energy  at  the  expense  of  losing  potential  energy.  Since  the  electron  accelerates,  it  should  radiate 

away (at least some) of the kinetic energy it is gaining. When it reaches the surface, its residual energy will 

be less than the vacuum level. 

While moving to the surface, the electron’s image charge will also move towards the surface. The 

image  charge is  a virtual  charge generated  by the polarisation  of  the  conduction  electrons  relative  to  the 

positive donor charges within a  layer just below the surface. When the image  charge reaches  this  layer it 

14

 

 

cannot be a virtual charge anymore but has to attach itself to one of the donors. Thus the nearest distance to 

the  surface  that  such  a  positive  charge  can  be  at,  will  be  determined  by  the  shallowest  donor below  the 

surface underneath the externally approaching electron. The positive  charge will remain stationary at this 

site so that the approaching electron will experience a Coulomb potential that is similar to what an electron 

experiences in the radial direction around the nucleus of  a  hydrogen atom. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. In 

order  to  enter  the  substrate,  the  electron  has  to  combine  with  this  donor  charge.  Since  the  electron  has 

radiated away energy, its energy when it reaches the surface might be below the energy of the donor level. 

Since the donor level is the lowest energy level available within the substrate, the electron cannot enter the 

substrate at all; except if it can be excited by some mechanism to reach the donor-level energy. If there is a 

z-axis perpendicular to the surface that goes through the positive donor charge situated at a depth s below 

the surface, while the electron is at a height z above the surface and displaced by a lateral distance r relative 

to the z-axis, the external electron will have a potential energy given by:

In order to describe the external electron quantum-mechanically, Schrödinger’s equation has to be 

solved for this potential energy. This has been done elsewhere [4] and will not be repeated here; only the 

results  relevant  to  the  present  discussion  will  be  summarised.  The  wave-function  can  be  divided  into  a 

perpendicular and a lateral component by first solving along the z-coordinate, using only the  first term in 

Eq. (22). The possible energy levels obtained are exactly the same as for a hydrogen atom: i.e. 

 

 

where n=1,2,3 etc.

For  each  concomitant  perpendicular  wave-function  the  most  probable  position  of  the  electron  can  be 
calculated  and  then  the  uncertainty  in  the  position  ∆z.  It  is  then  found  that  the  allowed  solutions  are 

determined by the depth (s) of the donor charge. The deeper the donor charge (i.e. the larger s), the larger 

the value  for the quantum number n of the lowest energy  wave-function that can manifest external to  the 

substrate. It has been found that this is determined by the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship for position 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15

and momentum. As soon as the depth s requires that the most probable position (of the electron) must be 
closer  to  the  surface  than  the  uncertainty  ∆z,  the  solution  cannot  manifest.  This  really  is  an  astonishing 

result,  because  the  surface  is  represented  by  a  perfectly  flat  plane,  as  is  customary  when  analysing 

interfaces in solid state electronics. Such an abstraction cannot exist. The surface of a clean semiconductor 

is usually reconstructed, so that there are no  “dangling” bonds; i.e. all the surface orbitals are bi-electron 

orbitals. Thus what really  should happen is that Pauli’s  exclusion principle prevents the external electron 

from  becoming  part  of  such  a  surface  orbital.  This  implies  that  if  the  external  electron  has  formed  an 

external orbital, it can only exist if it does not have to overlap by more than a critical amount with a surface 

orbital. We will come back to this overlapping mechanism in section 10. 

The second  term  in Eq. (22) has to be  included next.  If  the  most probable position  along the z-

direction is calculated relative to the positive  charge and found to be 
number n, one can replace  (

z +

)s

 in the second term with this most probable distance: i.e. 

nd

 for the solution with quantum 

Again a harmonic potential well! Although the wave function has to be two-dimensional, the Schrödinger 

equation  along  the  lateral  direction  is  in  effect  one-dimensional  because  there  is  no  orbital  momentum 

involved [4]. All directions are equivalent so that the two-dimensional wave is in any direction the same as 

for a one-dimensional wave. One thus obtains the well-known energy spectrum given by:

If Enh is lower than the donor energy-level, and the depth of the donor allows it, the electron can form such 

an external wave on the surface. To do this, the electron does not need to scale the electron-affinity barrier 

and lose energy by being decelerated and accelerated back (as described above); it can radiate energy by 

means of a “quantum jump” into the available external energy level.

The  only  difference  is  that,  in  the  case  of  the  electron  external  to  the  n-type  substrate,  the  harmonic 

potential  energy  is  active  in  two  dimensions  while  for  the  free  electron  it  is  active  in  three  dimensions. 

Could  the  positive  charge  in  the  latter  case  be  situated  along  a  fourth  dimension  separated  from  the 

electron’s charge-centre by a distance Rw? This possibility will now be investigated. 

9. Separation of matter from antimatter? 

By  analogy  it  will  now be  reasoned  that  in the  case of  a  free  electron  there  is  a positive charge  situated 

along  a  fourth  space  dimension  which  is  perpendicular  to  the  three-dimensional  space  within  which  the 

electron manifests as a localised wave. Such a model implies that there must be a three-dimensional barrier 

that prevents the electron  from reaching the positive charge and combining with it. What does the charge 

on the “other side” of the three-dimensional barrier relate to? The most logical deduction is to conclude that 

it relates to  antimatter;  i.e. to a positron. A  similar  model has been proposed by Boeyens but  for  another 

reason [5]. But what could cause such a barrier? “Outside” the electron-wave the fourth dimension relates 

to time. Since it is here assumed that the wave is a holistic entity this cannot be the case within the wave 

(see section 3). One can thus argue that it is for this reason why the fourth dimension is experienced as a 

space axis perpendicular to the isotropic three-dimensional space occupied by the holistic wave-entity (see 

also  section  17.1).  It  seems  intuitively  logical  to  speculate  that  the  three-dimensional  barrier  must  have 

something  to do  with  the  existence  of  time;  it  probably  relates  to  the  curvature  of space-time around  an 

object with mass. 

What is very attractive about the separation of matter and antimatter, across the three-dimensional 

vacuum, is that it gives a reason why our universe is mostly devoid of antimatter. This probably manifested 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17

when  “our”  universe  was  created.  There  is,  however,  a  problem:  the  localised  wave-intensity,  which  is 

assumed to be the electron, decays exponentially  to infinity. So if the wave-intensity  is the electron, does 

this  not  imply  that  the  electron  does not  have  an  “outside  space”  around  it? If  this  is  the  case,  a  barrier 

cannot form “outside” the electron. 

10. The essence of an electron-wave 

10.1 Covalent bonding 

Consider  the  following  experimentally  verifiable  situation:  Two  hydrogen  atoms  approach  each  other. 

Owing  to  the  exponential  decay  in  the  intensities  of  their  electron-waves  (s-orbitals)  these  orbitals  will 

always  overlap.  If  the  orbitals  are  the  electrons  within  which  their  charges  are  distributed,  does  this  not 

imply  that  their  charge-distributions  are  always  overlapping?  It  is  well  established  that  when  these  two 

atoms come “near enough” to each other they bond chemically. Why do they not do so at larger distances? 

Here  the  chemists  know  something  that  the  many-body  and  solid-state  physicists  generally  ignore  when 

they do perturbation calculations. 

 

According to chemistry, each atom has a so-called van der Waal’s radius. When the atoms are far 

apart  so  that  their van der Waal’s  radii do  not  overlap,  one  can  describe  the charge  interactions between 

them  (i.e.  the polarisation) in  classical  terms.  Once  their van der  Waal’s radii  overlap,  chemical bonding 

becomes possible (in fact mandatory); i.e. it requires quantum mechanics to “kick-in”. From this viewpoint, 

one  can  argue  that  chemical  bonding  occurs  owing  to  a  quantum-mechanical  “short-range”  force 

manifesting.  The  experimental  evidence  which  shows  that  it  is possible  to model  the  charge  interactions 

classically  (i.e. as point charges) at  larger distances, implies  that  the  distributed  charge of  both  s-orbitals 

does  not  extend  further  than  their  van  der  Waals’  radii.  One  has  to  conclude  that  there  exists  a  critical 

radius in all  directions  around the  centre  of charge  (also corresponding  to the  centre  of mass) defining a 

volume within which the essence of the electron is manifesting as distributed charge. Outside this volume 

the electron orbital must then be experienced as a point charge; i.e. a “point-particle” with a point charge –e 

and a concomitant point mass. The reason why the latter situation manifests is a direct consequence of the 

validity of Gauss’ law. 

 

In section 8 it was pointed out that an external orbital can only exist when it does not overlap a bi-

electron orbital by so much that it has to violate Pauli’s exclusion principle. The same argument may now 

be used: the two  approaching s-orbitals can manifest separately as  long their van der Waals’ radii do not 

overlap. Thus a localised wave or orbital must have (along all directions) a critical radius within which the 

essence  of  the  “wave  behaviour”  of  the  holistic  wave  resides  and  which  requires  quantum  mechanics  to 

“kick-in”  when  (in  any  direction)  the  concomitant  radius  starts  to  overlap  with  another  wave-entity’s 
critical  radius.  Such  a  radius  must  be  proportional  to  the  uncertainty  ∆r  (calculated  from  the  centre  of 

charge) in the direction of overlap. We will thus write the overlap radius RO along a direction r as:

The proportionality constant (β) will be called the overlap parameter. 

10.2 The Mott transition 

Another example which indicates that such a critical radius might exist is given by the Mott transition. The 

latter transition manifests within doped semiconductors when the dopant density reaches a critical density. 

Consider,  for example  an  n-type semiconductor at very  low  temperatures  so that the  dopant electrons  all 

reside on the donor centres. It is well known that below a critical density, the dopant-electrons are identical, 

individual  pseudo-particles  which  can,  under  suitable  circumstances,  be  represented  by  hydrogen-like  s-

orbitals.  When the donor-density reaches  the  critical density,  the  localised s-orbitals  morph into extended 

waves stretching over the whole volume of the semiconductor; i.e. a so-called impurity band forms. Many 

studies have  been done  on  the Mott  transition.  A  relationship,  which  seems  to be  the same  for  all doped 

semiconductors,  has  been  found  between  the  Bohr-radius  aB  of  the  s-orbitals  and  the  density  of  dopant 

centres ND [6]: i.e.

Two s-orbitals, out of a row of orbitals at this critical spacing, are shown in Fig. 2. From Eq. (31) one can 

derive a value for the overlap parameter as defined in Eq. (30). By setting

 the concomitant 

value found for β is equal to ≈1.28. This value is probably incorrect because the donor centres do not form 

a perfect cubic arrangement within the material. One expects that a percolation threshold has to be reached 

and that this will require a different density ND than would be the case for a perfectly periodic arrangement 

of the dopant centres. 

10.3 Gaussian waves 

As already discussed in section 8, external orbitals should  be able to  form on  the surface of a suitable n-

type semiconductor and that these orbitals could then have Gaussian shapes along directions parallel to the 

surface.  It  is  thus  probable  that  the  density  of  an  array  of  such  orbitals  could  reach  the  critical  overlap 

distance. In Fig. 3 two Gaussian orbitals out of  a row of orbitals  are shown when  they are  far from each 

other, and when they overlap so that just a small dimple is present between them. When they approach each 

other slightly more, this dimple disappears completely. This happens when the overlap parameter reaches 

an intriguing value; i.e. 

19

 

 

 

 

 

=β

.≈
4112

 

 

 

 

(32) 

This  value  does  not  differ  very  much  from  the  value  derived  from  the  Mott-transition  data.  When 
calculating the  constant in Eq. (31) using the value  for β in Eq. (32), one obtains a value of 0.24; which 

might be the correct value that would apply when the dopants form a perfect periodic array. At this critical 

juncture the (pseudo) s-orbitals morph to form delocalised waves. What will the Gaussian orbitals do?  

When the orbitals are single-electron, Gaussian-shaped waves, adjacent waves with opposite spins 

might combine to form an array of bi-electron Gaussian waves. Such a wave has zero spin and an energy 

equal to 

ω= hE

; i.e. it is a boson. The two single-electron waves might not even need to move into each 

other to reach full overlap. As soon as they reach critical overlap at the overlap distance, they might already 

constitute  a boson entity. A more  interesting situation  arises when all the Gaussian waves are bi-electron 

waves that reach overlap. Will they manifest a Mott transition to form delocalised waves over the surface 

of  the  substrate  subject  to  Fermi-Dirac  statistics?  One  could,  alternatively,  argue  that  each  wave  now 

manifests a boson. Will they then not rather form a Bose-Einstein condensate? One expects that this might 

happen  under  suitable  circumstances  for  s-orbitals:  for  example,  when  helium  atoms condense  to  form  a 

superfluid; however, in the case of Gaussian-shaped waves a far more interesting phase transition might be 

able to manifest. We will analyse the latter possibility in section 16. 

10.4 Outside the critical radius 

The following question now seems to be relevant: why does the wave-intensity decay all the way to infinity 

if it can represent the essence of the electron by just existing up to the overlap radius RO? From the analyses 

reported in section 8, it was found that the rest of the wave-tail outside the radius RO can manifest within 

the substrate material; i.e. it is the “tunnelling tail” that can penetrate an “energy barrier”. It is thus a kind 

of “ghost tail”. The part of the wave within the overlap radius cannot reside within the substrate unless the 

electron can chemically interact with the material constituting the energy barrier. Could the rest of the wave 

intensity outside  the  overlap radius RO  have  something  to  do with  the bending of  space  around  an  entity 

with  mass?  It  is  an  interesting  thought  which  indicates  that  a  simple-smooth  unification  of  quantum 

mechanics and Einstein’s theory of gravity might be less difficult than had been believed up to now! 

11. Visualising quantum mechanical interactions 

According to the Copenhagen interpretation one cannot visualise what is happening in the quantum world 

but only observe the outcomes when such interactions have taken place. Schrödinger formulated his wave 

equation in the hope that the latter viewpoint could be remedied. It is reported that he has said: “I knew of 

[Heisenberg’s]  theory,  of  course,  but  I  felt  discouraged,  not  to  say  repelled,  by  the  methods  of 

transcendental  algebra,  which  appeared  difficult  to  me,  and  by  the  lack  of  visualizability”.  Heisenberg 

stated:  “The  more  I  think  about  the  physical  portion  of  Schrödinger’s  theory,  the  more  repulsive  I  find 

it….What  Schrödinger  writes  about  the  visualizability  of his  theory  is  probably  not  quite  right,  in  other 

 

 

 

 

 

 

20

word’s it’s crap”. After visiting Bohr in Copenhagen, Schrödinger said in despair: “Had I known that we 

were  not  going  to  get  rid  of  this  damned  quantum  jumping,  I  would  not  have  involved  myself  in  the 

business. Born rubbed salt into the wound by stating that: “No language which lends itself to visualizability 

can  describe  the  quantum  jumps.”  As  already  mentioned,  these  concepts  have  been  extended  and 

dogmatised.  It  is believed today  that no quantum-mechanical interaction can be visualised. It will now be 

argued here  that the interpretation of an electron  as a holistic wave-entity allows one to visualise what is 

happening when “quantum”-interactions occur. 

11.1 Quantum jumps of an atomic electron 

How does a photon increase the energy of an orbital electron around the nucleus of an atom? According to 

section 7 the energy of a holistic electron-wave is its mass. Thus a lower energy electron-orbital must have 

a lower mass and a higher energy electron-orbital must have a larger mass. It is now postulated that when a 

suitable  photon  impinges  on  an  atomic  electron-orbital,  it  “coalesces”  with  the  orbital  to  form  another, 

higher-energy single holistic wave-entity. The energy of the photon adds to the mass of the electron-orbital 

and this requires it to “morph instantaneously” into a higher energy orbital. To fit in with older terminology 

this  “melting  together”  of  the  photon  and  holistic  electron-orbital  will  be  called  “entanglement”.  This 

means  that  before  entangling,  they  are  two  separate  waves,  but  afterwards  they  form  a  new  holistic 

electron-orbital within which  time  can  still  not  manifest; and which is the excited  electron.  According to 

this  visualisation  there  are no  “electron-jumps”  involved but  rather  wave-morphs.  De-excitation is thus a 

disentanglement  of 

the  photon  energy  from 

the  excited,  holistic  electron-orbital  which 

then 

“instantaneously” morphs back to again become a ground-state orbital. 

 

The word  “instantaneous” is used  here  because  it  will now be postulated  that  wave-morphing is 

not  limited by  the  speed  of  light.  This  is  why it seems  as  if  an  electron jumps  instantaneously  from one 

energy  level  to  the  other.  The  time  required  is  most  probably  only  limited  by  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty 
relationship  for  energy  and  time;  for  example,  when  the  photon  adds  energy  ∆E  to  the  ground-state 
electron-orbital  of  an  atom,  this  wave  must  morph  within  a  time  interval  ∆t,  as  limited  by  Heisenberg’s 

uncertainty relationship. The wave can only sustain the additional energy without morphing for this time-

duration. This implies that the energy of any holistic wave can “flicker” with time; i.e. the wave can borrow 

energy  for  short  times  without  changing  its  identity  through  morphing  into  another  wave;  however, 

sometimes the amount is large enough to effect real changes. It is proposed here that this “flickering” must 

be  responsible  for  “tunnelling”,  and  thus  also  for  radioactive  decay;  i.e.  by  borrowing  energy,  the  wave 

entity  can  scale  an  energy  barrier.  It  should  be  noted  that  for  the  interpretation  of  quantum  mechanics 

proposed here, a “particle” cannot “tunnel through” a barrier. This is so because the essence of the particle-

wave,  within the  overlap  radius  RO,  cannot  enter  another  material  without chemically  interacting  with  it. 

Thus “tunnelling” must always occur by borrowing energy and then scaling an energy barrier. The apparent 

statistical  nature  of  quantum  mechanics  most  probably  relates  completely  to  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty 

relationship for energy and time. It can, for example, be argued that the statistical time-behaviour observed 

 

 

21

when  a  collection  of  excited  atoms  de-excite  also  relates  to  this  energy-time  “flickering”;  i.e.  various 

“attempts” are made by an excited orbital-wave to borrow enough energy in order to scale  an “activation 

barrier”  before  de-excitation  can  occur.  The  same  “flickering”  is  probably  also  responsible  for  the 

anomalous g-factor of the electron, the  Lamb shift, Rabi oscillations and possibly the Casimir effect. The 

obvious question to ask is: where does the borrowed energy come from? According to quantum field theory 

the vacuum has energy and the “flicker”-energy comes from “vacuum-fluctuations”. We will return to this 

aspect in section 14.4. 

A photon must also be a holistic entity “within which” time does not manifest, or else it would not 

be able to morph instantaneously to coalesce with an electron-wave. It should, however, be noted that in the 

case of a photon this absence of time does not relate to a time-independent wave function that is stationary 

relative to an inertial reference frame, but to the fact that the photon always moves with the speed of light 

relative  to  any  inertial reference  frame. When using the  Lorentz  transformation  to  calculate the  time-rate 

“within” a photon relative to any inertial reference frame, the answer obtained is always zero; even though 

light  waves  always  manifest  as  time-dependent  fields  when  observed  relative  to  any  inertial  reference 

frame. 

 

11.2 Interactions between atomic orbitals 

As already mentioned in section 1, the concept of “entanglement” comes from Schrödinger. According to 

his  interpretation,  all  the  “particles”  represented  by  a  “multi-particle”  wave  are  entangled.  In  paragraph 

11.1 the word “entanglement” was used to describe the situation when holistic waves “melt together” and 

lose their separate identities. Does this happen under all circumstances when a multi-particle wave forms? 

No it does not! Although the electrons around a multi-electron atom form a multi-particle wave, they have 

not  all lost their  separate  identities completely.  Separate orbitals  manifest;  except  in  the  case where  two 

electrons  with  opposite  spins  “coalesce”  in  order  to  form  a  new  holistic  bi-electron  orbital.  Only  in  the 

latter case do the two electron wave-entities entangle to form a new holistic entity. To repeat: although all 

the  orbitals  together  do  form  a  “single  multi-particle  wave”  around  the  atom’s  nucleus,  they  are  not 

superposed  in  such  a  manner  that  they  all  lose  their  separate  holistic  identities  in  order  to  form  a  new 

holistic  macro-wave.  In  order  to  distinguish  the  latter  type  of  superposition  from  entanglement,  it  is 

proposed  here  that  it  should  be  called  “enmeshment”.  According  to  this  classification,  entanglement  of 

single-electron waves can only occur between two holistic electron wave-entities when they have opposite 

spins. When they have parallel spins, entanglement should not be possible. 

 

The  fascinating aspect  is  that  each  atomic  orbital, whether  it  is a  single-electron orbital  or  a  bi-

electron  orbital,  is  still  interpreted  as  a  single  holistic  entity  within  which  time  cannot  manifest.  When 

calculating the intensity distribution of higher energy orbitals like p-orbitals, d-orbitals etc., it is found that 

the intensities of these orbitals can break up into separate parts. This implies that the single holistic wave-

entity  can  split  up  into  separate  parts  within  three-dimensional  space  when  it  encounters  appropriate 

boundary  conditions.  How  do  these  separate  regions  stay  in  instantaneous  contact  with  each  other?  Are 

 

22

they connected to each other  along the fourth dimension?  Most probably! This  aspect will be considered 

further in section 14.4 

One  can  now  also  argue  that  when  two  hydrogen  atoms  bond,  the  electron  orbitals  entangle  to 

form  a bi-electron  holistic entity within which  the charge  of  -2e  is  redistributed  within a  critical  volume 

which (in each direction) is defined by the appropriate critical radius RO. As already pointed out above, the 

critical volume is not necessarily a sphere; it can have different values for the critical radius RO in different 

directions.  Using  this  assumption,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  the  properties  of  the  hydrogen-molecule’s 

covalent bond in a much simpler way than had been done in the scientific literature up to now [4]. 

11.3 The photo-electric effect and Compton scattering 

The major move away from waves started when Einstein modelled the photo-electric effect as a “collision” 

between a photon-particle and an electron-particle. Does this not prove unequivocally that particles must be 

the  building  blocks of our universe?  Consider,  however, the  following  mechanism:  an  impinging  photon 

entangles with a holistic electron-wave in the metal and thus increases its energy.  If the photon energy is 

equal to the workfunction of the metal, the electron-wave will morph into a free electron wave with mass 

equal to the rest mass of the electron; i.e. it will be stationary relative to an inertial reference frame attached 

to the metal. If the photon has a higher energy, the electron-wave will morph into a free electron-wave with 

a mass larger than the rest mass of an electron. According to Einstein’s special theory of relativity this extra 

mass manifests as kinetic energy relative to the inertial reference frame attached to the metal. The electron 

will thus speed away from the metal. 

Thus  there  is  no  “hard-ball”  collision  involved;  just  as  there  are  no  “electron-jumps”  within  an 

atom. Both processes are the result of the photon entangling with a holistic electron-wave thus causing this 

electron-wave to morph into another holistic electron-wave. Similarly for Compton scattering: in this case 

only part of the photon’s energy entangles with the holistic electron-wave in order to transfer momentum 

and  kinetic  energy.  Why  does  one  need  “particles”?  Waves  can  do  it  all!  And  what  they  do,  can  be 

visualised!  A  further  interesting  aspect  of  Compton  scattering  is  that  the  photon,  which  should  also  be 

considered as a holistic wave-entity on its own, now splits up into two parts; one proceeding with a lower 

energy and the other entangling with the electron-wave. 

11.4 Diffraction of photons and electrons  

Photons and electrons can diffract. It had been Thomas Young’s demonstration of double slit diffraction of 

light  that  destroyed  Newton’s  corpuscular  theory.  It  is  the  photo-electric  effect  that  brought  back  the 

interpretation of “light particles” now called photons. How can particles diffract? Feynman called this “the 

only mystery in physics”. When sending in light in such a way that one photon at a time impinges on the 

double slits, and the result is recorded as a photon at a time on a screen on the other side of the slits, then, 

after many photons have passed through the slits, the intensity on the screen becomes that of a diffraction 

pattern. Such a pattern can only form when a wave moves through both slits and “interferes” with itself on 

 

 

 

 

23

its way to the detection screen. Does each photon move through both slits? When an experiment is set up to 

determine whether this is possible, it is found that the photons appear on the other side after passing either 

through one or the other slit, not through both; however, under these experimental conditions the diffraction 

pattern disappears. The same arguments are valid for electrons. 

According  to  the  Copenhagen  interpretation  this  experiment  proves  that  we  can  have  different 

outcomes depending on how we observe what is happening. If we do not look through which slit a photon 

moves, nature contrives a diffraction pattern. When we do look, the diffraction pattern disappears. Thus we 

cannot really fathom what is happening on the quantum scale; i.e. by looking we help to create a “reality” 

in which the photons  follow definite paths like particles. If we do not look, the quantum world is  able to 

work  its  “magic”  unseen.  So  “our”  universe  is  not  just  a  gambling  house,  it  is  also  a  magician’s  show; 

things can change when the magician covers items with a cloth and then takes the cloth away. 

Although it is postulated here that a photon and an electron are both holistic waves within which 

time  cannot  exist,  it  has  been  found  that  these  entities  can  “go  to  pieces”  when  they  encounter  suitable 

boundary conditions. The higher-energy atomic orbitals can separate into different parts and a photon can 

divide in two during Compton scattering. Thus, why is it not possible that a single photon (and an electron 

under  suitable  conditions) which approaches  a  double  slit  could  enmesh with  the  slits  and  move  through 

both slits simultaneously to in this way interfere with itself on its way to the screen? While it is interfering, 

it stays enmeshed until another interaction occurs, or another measurement is made. When this enmeshed 

wave reaches a detector screen far behind the double slits, the screen makes a “position measurement” on 

the wave. The enmeshed photon is then “set free” and it morphs into a localised wave. Since the enmeshed 

photon-wave is spread out before reaching the screen,  it has a wide range of positions  to “choose”  from. 

This  would  mean  that  the  enmeshed  wave  will  stay  a  diffracted  and  self-interfering  wave,  until  it 

encounters  the  screen.  If  a  position-detector  is  used  in  order  to  determine  through  which  slit  the  photon 

came,  the  enmeshed wave has to localise as soon as it has  passed through both slits,  and thus before any 

interference  could  have  occurred.  No  diffraction-pattern  should  then  be  produced;  exactly  as  is  found 

experimentally. 

 

A  recent  experiment  by  Afshar  [7]  is  in  agreement  with  the  explanation  given  here.  The 

experimental  arrangement  he  used  is  shown  schematically  in  Fig.  4.  In  this  experiment  laser  light  is 

diffracted through two adjacent holes from where it proceeds to a lens which  focuses the light from each 

hole to be collected by its concomitant photon detector (see Fig. 4): i.e. each detector respectively records 

the light coming from only one of the holes. In this experiment it was found that the images related to the 

impinging intensity from each hole were identical; thus showing that 50% of the light came from one hole 

and  50% from  the  other.  Accordingly  it  has  been  argued that this proves  that  each photon  came  through 

only one of the holes. If diffraction and interference were present there should be regions on the lens where 

there  will  be  no  light-intensity.  If  the  photons  came  randomly  from  the  two  pinholes,  they  should  be 

uniformly distributed over the lens. The regions on the lens where the intensity would be zero (if diffraction 

occurred) were then carefully covered by wires. The images collected at the two detectors were compared 

 

 

 

24

to the images before these regions had been covered. Within experimental error the images were found to 

be the same: i.e. no photons encountered the wires on the lens. With one of the pinholes covered, the image 

in  its  respective  photon  detector  deteriorated;  in  accordance  with  photons  encountering  the  wires  on  the 

lens. The conclusion reached is as follows: although it is observed that the particles go through one hole at 

a  time,  diffraction  is  also  observed simultaneously,  and  therefore Bohr’s  principle  of complementarity  is 

violated!  In  terms  of  the  interpretation  given  here,  the  experimental  result  is,  however,  generated  as 

follows: each photon does enmesh with the slits, split up and passes through both holes so that it interferes 

with itself on the other side. Therefore it cannot scatter from the wires, but as soon as it enters the lens, the 

boundary conditions change which requires it to localise again. Owing to the symmetry of the set-up, half 

of the photons localise to end up in one detector and the other half in the other detector. 

Nonetheless,  there  still  remains  a  fascinating  aspect  to  the  localisation  of  a  single  diffracting 

photon when it is observed by a detector or a screen. It only localises at a single point on a screen, but after 

many photons have localised on the screen their statistical distribution on the screen forms the diffraction 

pattern that relates to the intensity distribution of a single photon before it strikes the screen. There are two 

possibilities: 

(i) 

The  point  at  which  the  wave  localises  could  be  any  point  with  a  high  enough  intensity  as 

determined by the diffracting wave before it morphs into a localised orbital. This would mean 

that  the  diffracted  wave  determines  (on  its  own)  what  the  statistical  spread  of  collapsing 

should be: i.e. it acts like a probability-amplitude; albeit not quite in the manner as had been 

postulated by Born. This interpretation implies that when an extended photon strikes an eye it 

need not localise to be recorded within the eye. 

(ii) 

Alternatively,  the  approaching photon  could  localise  at  the  first point of  encounter with  the 

screen.  One  could  surmise  that  the  first  wave-entity  which  forms  part  of  the  screen,  with 

which  the  impinging  diffracted  wave  would  have  to  overlap  by  more  than  its  overlapping 

radius,  would  be  where  the  collapse  of  the  wave  will  be  recorded.  Since  such  entities  are 

statistically  evenly  spread  within  the  screen,  a  large  number  of  identically  diffracted  wave-

entities could localise at different points in order to generate the diffraction pattern. The real 

reason for this statistical spread (as already surmised in section 11.1) most probably relates to 

Heisenberg’s uncertainty relationship for energy and time; i.e. the photons, although identical, 

have  small  statistical  variations  in  their  energies  (and  thus  shapes)  and  this  causes  them  to 

localise at different points on the screen. 

The two possibilities suggest the following experiment: change the size of the screen and see whether the 

intensity changes; for example, make the width of the screen the same as the width of the central diffracted 

line,  and see whether the  intensity of  this  line  is  higher  than it  is  when using a  full  screen  for  the  same 

number  of  photons.  If  it  is  not,  explanation  (i)  applies;  but  if  it  is,  explanation  (ii)  applies.  From  the 

viewpoint of causality, explanation (ii) would probably make more sense.

11.5 EPR experiments 

Consider  two  electrons  being  accelerated  towards  each  other.  Their  charges  will  repel.  When  they  are 

separated  by  more  than  their  critical  radii,  each  will  experience  the  other  as  a  negative  point  charge. 

Solving  the  Schrödinger  equation  for  either  electron  will  cause  their  critical  radii  in  the  direction  of 

approach to  shrink.  If  their  velocities  are not  high enough, they  will  scatter backwards  from  each other; 

however,  if  their  velocities  are high  enough,  so that  their  critical radii  do manage  to reach  overlap,  they 

could move right into each other, provided they have opposite spins. They are then able to entangle in order 

to  form  a  single  holistic  bi-electron  wave  that  spreads  out  within  its  proper  inertial  reference  frame,  in 

which its centre of mass remains stationary. If the wave is not disentangled by another interaction, it might 

spread for light years, and stay a single holistic entity within which time does not exist. 

 

When a  measurement is then made, which  forces disentanglement  to occur, the two components 

appear (near) instantaneously and in a correlated manner; i.e. if you choose to disentangle them with a spin 

measurement in a specific direction, the wave will disentangle into two sub-waves with opposite spins. An 

EPR experiment thus has a simple causal explanation. It is not two “particles” communicating faster than 

the  speed  of  light,  but  a single holistic  wave  that  instantaneously decomposes  into two sub-waves which 

have to be correlated. After disentanglement, the two wave-entities are two separate single electron-waves 

which cannot communicate with each other faster than the speed of light. So, Einstein was right! Separate 

“particles”  cannot  communicate  with  each  other  at  a  speed  that  is  faster  than  the  speed  of  light.  The 

Copenhagen interpretation is not tenable! 

11. Laser beams 

One expects that in the case of photons entanglement should be far easier because they are bosons. Many of 

them, having the same energy, should be able to become entangled in order to form a large macro-holistic 

wave-entity.  I  propose  here  that  this  is  the  essence  when  a  laser-beam  is  generated.  In  this  context  one 

should realise  that  light waves with different energies should be able to enmesh; however,  these separate 

holistic  waves  which  form  an  enmeshed  wave  might  not  be  separately  observable  when  looking  at  the 

enmeshed wave with the human eye. It might require a spectrometer to separate them from each other. The 

latter is, of course, commensurate with all experiments done to date. 

26

12. Blackbody radiation 

Although  Einstein  cemented  the  quantum  revolution,  it  was  really  Max  Planck’s  analysis  of  blackbody 

radiation that gave birth to  it.  In order to model the blackbody  spectrum, he had  to assume  that  any light 
wave with a frequency ω can never have less energy than a quantum amount ∆E given by: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(33) 

ω=∆
hE

 

This equation is  at present used to argue  that all light  always exists of “photon-particles”; however,  all it 

states  is  that  the  energy  of  light  is  quantised.  This  does  not  necessarily  imply  that  light  consists  of 

“particles”. 

12.1 Cavity radiation 

It is now well known that blackbody radiation can be best measured through a small hole in the side of a 

heated enclosed box, and that there are two ways to model the spectrum of this so-called cavity radiation; 

subject to the restriction given by Eq. (33): 

(i) 

The  light  within  the  cavity  is  modelled  as  standing  waves  subject  to  Maxwell-Boltzmann 

statistics. Although  each wave spreads  right through the  box (is  delocalised) each  harmonic 

wave component cannot have less energy than given by Eq. (33). 

(ii) 

The  light  within  the  cavity  is  modelled  as  a  photon  gas  subject  to  Bose-Einstein  statistics. 

Localised “photon-particles”, each with an energy given by Eq. (33) now constitute the light 

within the cavity. 

Both approaches give identical results. There is, however,  a problem  that  is not usually emphasised. The 

allowed  wave  frequencies  are  determined  by  the  size  of  the  cavity:  the  larger  the  cavity,  the  closer  the 

frequencies  (and  thus  energy-levels)  are  spaced.  The  fact  is  that  these  allowed  frequencies  can  only  be 

derived from the boundary conditions which limit the space that is occupied by delocalised standing waves. 

How  do  localised  photons  know  which  energies  are  allowed?  After  all,  Bose-Einstein  statistics  can  be 

applied to any distribution of energy levels. Thus to describe the radiation in the cavity by photons, one still 

has to  first solve  for the spectrum  in energy levels by applying boundary  conditions to waves that extend 

over  the  whole  cavity.  How  can  this  be  explained?  One  could  argue  as  follows:  it  is  possible  for  a 

superposed  wave  to  be  “assembled”  from  different  basis-waves  even  if  the  basis  waves  are  not  the 

appropriate  harmonics  that  will  manifest  under  the  applicable  boundary  conditions;  for  example,  violin 

music can be constructed electronically from square basis waves (or any other shape), even though the true 

harmonic  waves  that  superpose  to  generate  the  music  are  sinusoidal.  Thus  the  light  in  the  cavity  most 

probably consists of an enmeshment of standing waves. To measure the spectrum, the light coming through 

the small hole must be recorded by a detector. The boundary conditions change and this requires the light 

wave being emitted to “de-enmesh” and morph in order to form a localised photon. Thus the measurement 

27

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

decomposes  the  enmeshed  light  wave  within  the  cavity  into  another  set  of  basis  waves  which  can  also 

represent the light in the cavity; but they are not the “real” harmonic-waves which are determined by  the 

dimensions of the cavity. “Wave-particle duality” might thus not be “complementary magic”, but manifests 

because all matter and light consist of waves which can be superposed and decomposed into different sets 

of basis waves other than the applicable harmonic waves. 

If,  as  reasoned  here,  the  light  waves  in  the  cavity  are  delocalised  stationary  waves,  does  it  not 

imply  that  light  can  be  stationary  relative  to  an  inertial  reference  frame  attached  to  the  box  forming  the 

cavity? I do not think so, because in this case the stationary waves are akin to waves on a violin string. The 

stationary  waves  are  formed  by  light  waves,  all  moving  with  light  speed,  which  superpose.  A  single 

standing  wave  is  in  this  case  a  superposition  of  a  light  wave  (moving  in  a  specific  direction)  with  its 

component  that  has  been  reflected  from  the  walls  of  the  cavity  (so  that  the  latter  moves  in  the  opposite 

direction).  Although  one  can  still  argue  that  it  is  a  holistic entity,  it  is  changing with  time  when  viewed 

relative to an inertial reference frame attached to the box; i.e. it oscillates.  

12.2 Cosmic background radiation 

It has now been well-established that “our” universe is filled with black-body radiation at a temperature of 
≈2.7 K. It is believed that this is the “cooled-down” version of the light that had been generated at a much 

higher temperature during the Big Bang. The remarkable aspect of the cosmic background radiation is  its 

uniformity. The photons and their intensity reaching us from all directions are approximately the same. In 

contrast, light from far-lying galaxies is only reaching us now after it has travelled for billions of  years at 

the speed of light; and even though these galaxies are seen as they had been billions of years ago, they look 

very similar to our own galaxy as  well as galaxies residing closer by. It seems as if  there might be some 

instantaneous communication across “our” universe that ensures this uniformity. 

 

It is also well-known  that “our” universe is expanding, and that  this expansion is  even speeding 

up. Thus in earlier times the universe must have been smaller. The spacing in energy levels for the cosmic 

background  radiation  must  then  have  been  larger.  As  the  universe  became  larger,  the  spacings  had  to 

decrease. But how did the concomitant photons know that  they had to adjust to  these changes? Does this 

not  imply  that  the  cosmic  background  radiation  has  to  consist  of  standing  waves  stretching  right  across 

“our” universe? But why does one measure photons when observing this radiation? In terms of the model 

presented in this publication this means that a light wave stretching across the whole cosmos morphs near-

instantaneously into a localised photon when it encounters  a detector; and this is caused by the change in 

boundary  conditions  which  the  detector  represent.  The  observed  uniformity  of  the  cosmic  background 

radiation  thus  relates  to  standing  waves  “filling  our  whole  universe”.  As  “our”  universe  expands,  the 

standing light waves  morphs into lower energy ones because the spacing between  energy-levels becomes 

smaller. Therefore the cosmic background radiation cools and, owing to the ability of the waves to morph 

instantaneously,  this happens uniformly across “our” universe.  If  this deduction is correct, one should, at 

 

 

 

28

least  in  principle,  be  able  to  estimate  the  size  of  “our”  universe  by  measuring  the  spacing  between  the 

energy-levels of the cosmic background radiation. 

13. Bands and bonds in solids 

When theoretical solid-state physicists model the electronic properties of a covalently bonded solid material 

subject  to  the  Born-Oppenheimer  approximation,  they  find  that  the  valence  electrons,  keeping  the  solid 

together,  are  delocalised  throughout  the  solid  and  their  energies  lie  within  bands.  When  measuring  the 

energies by, for example, using photo-electron spectroscopy, the energies do indeed manifest within bands. 

When  theoretical  chemists  model  the  same  valence  electrons,  they  conclude  that  they  pair-up  to  form 

identical bonds each  having  the  same  energy; i.e.  each valence  electron has  the  same  energy. When this 

picture  is  applied  to  chemical  interactions,  it  works!  It  confirms  that  under  these  conditions  the  valence 

electrons must  all have  the  same energy. How  can  this  be  explained  within  the  context  proposed in this 

publication? Well, the solid is an enmeshed-entangled wave. Different basis waves can generate the same 

result. This also implies that the superposed wave can be decomposed into different basis waves by doing 

different  measurements;  i.e.  by  changing  the  boundary  conditions  in  different  ways.  Thus  when  doing 

photo-electron  spectroscopy,  the  Born-Oppenheimer  approximation  leads  to  the  appropriate  basis  waves 

into which the valence electron wave can be decomposed; however, when doing chemistry the atoms play a 

larger  role  in  the  superposition  of  the  valence-electron  waves,  and  this  leads  to  a  decomposition  of  the 

enmeshed-entangled wave into identical chemical bonds. 

 

Furthermore, when  modelling  a  metal,  the  valence  electron waves  are all  delocalised stationary-

waves stretching over the whole solid. When applying an electric field via two contacts, pseudo-electrons 

carry  a  current.  The  charge-carriers  are  thus  wave  packets  formed  by  the  superposition  of  the  extended 

waves. Do these wave packets exist when there is no electric field present which requires them to be there? 

It  is unlikely that many such wave packets will exist when there  is no electric  field.  If they did, it would 

mean  that  they  move  constantly  through  the  solid;  they  should  then  generate  electromagnetic  radiation 

because they move relative to the other charges in the metal. This is not observed at low temperatures. Thus 

it seems that at low temperatures the reality is delocalised stationary waves which do not move relative to 

the other charges in the metal. Only when interacting with the valence electrons, by, for example, applying 

an electric field or heating the metal, do these waves seem to superpose and morph into wave-packets.  

14. Aspects when modelling a free electron 

The electron has always been an enigmatic entity. In order to further discuss and speculate on the model for 

a  free electron proposed here (the basic principles have been formulated in section 7) aspects of previous 

analyses of the properties of an electron will also be brought into consideration and compared. This should 

not be considered as an attack on the previous approaches, but rather as an objective search for answers. 

 

 

 

 

 

29

14.1 The electrical self-energy field 

Even before the advent of quantum mechanics the leading physicists of the day encountered problems when 

analysing  the  electron.  These  problems  have  been  summarised  in  The  Feynman  Lectures  on  Physics  II, 

chapter  2  [8].  When  they  tried  to  model  the  electron  as  a  particle  with  a  radius,  inconsistencies  arose. 

Classical  electrodynamics  required  that  the  electron  should  be  modelled  as  a  “point-particle”;  i.e.  as  a 

particle  which  has  both  its  mass  and  charge  situated  at  a  point.  Present  day  electron-electron  scattering 

experiments also indicate that the electron’s size could be infinitesimally small. The problem is that such a 

small size causes the  energy of  the electric  field (which is  calculated) around the electron to be infinitely 

large.  This  problem  did  not  go  away  with  the  advent  of  quantum  mechanics  and  is  “removed”  from 

quantum  electrodynamics  by  means  of  “renormalisation”.  The  latter  procedure  has  become  such  an 

inherent part of all quantum field theories, that at present the “renormalisability of a theory” is accepted as 

proof that the theory is “realistic”. 

 

When a stationary electron with charge –e and another stationary charge q are a distance r apart, 

the force F exerted by the electron on the charge q is given by Coulomb’s inverse square law. According to 

the concept of fields it is reasoned that there exists at all times an electric field E around the electron so that 

when  placing  a  charge  q  at  any  position  from  the  electron,  a  force 

qE

  acts  on  it.  According  to 

F =

Maxwell’s  equations  an  electric  field  has  energy  and  this  energy  can  be  calculated  at  every  point  in  the 
field  from  the  square  of  the  field  strength  E2  at  that  point.  When  doing  this  calculation  for  a  solitary 

electron, and integrating over all the points surrounding it in order to calculate the total field-energy around 

an electron, the energy obtained is an infinite amount. The only way to make it finite is to give the electron 

a substantial radius; but, as discussed by Feynman [8] even more serious problems then arise. 

But  does  the  calculation  of  the  electric  energy-field  around  a  solitary  electron  not  require  a  unique 

stationary  reference  frame to  exist?  The  existence of other  matter is,  also  here,  ignored (similarly as had 

been  found  in  section  4)  and  the  calculation  is  done  as  if  the  electron  is  the  only  object  existing  in  the 

universe. Where will one get a single negative charge without at least also a positive charge somewhere in 

the  universe  in  order  to  ensure  neutrality?  In  fact,  according  to  electrodynamics  all  electric  fields  with 

energy  are  formed  in  space  between  separated  electric  charges;  for  example,  between  the  plates  of  a 

charged  capacitor.  When,  however, calculating  the energy  of the  electric  field  around  a solitary electron, 

other  charges  are  ignored  as  if  they  are  not  playing  any  role  to  generate  the  field.  This  seems  to  be  a 

dubious approach. After all, one can argue vice versa that the actual field is around the charge q, while the 

electron is in the field of q. In other words, how does one know that there is electric field-energy around the 

electron  without  the  charge  q  being  present?  The  experimental  fact  is  that  there  is  no  other  way  to 

determine  the  presence  of  the  field-energy  except  to  use  a  “test”  charge  q.  Does  it  then  make  scientific 

sense to assume that there is field-energy without q being part of the set-up? May it not be equally logical 

to assume that there  is no energy  at  any position r around  a solitary  charge unless other charges are also 

around? If so, the derivation of the electric field-energy around a solitary electron calculates something that 

cannot exist. 

 

30

What is ironic is that the calculation of the electric field-energy around a single electron even violates 

the  tenets  of  the  Copenhagen  interpretation.  According  to  the  Copenhagen  interpretation  there  are 

uncertainties in the position and the momentum of a point particle; so how can one have a stationary point 

particle around which to calculate the electric field? It might be reasoned that one can know the position of 

a point particle accurately but then have no knowledge of its momentum. Should one not then ask relative 

to which inertial reference frame can one know the position of a point particle with 100% accuracy if one 

does  not  know  its  momentum?  One  needs  to  also  know  its  momentum  in  order  to  know  the  inertial 

reference frame relative to which one can specify the position of the point particle in order to calculate the 

energy of its “surrounding stationary field” (relative to this reference frame). 

According  to  the  approach  proposed  in  section  7,  the  electrical  interaction  of  the  electron-charge  is 

over the  fourth dimension Thus  the  charge  distribution  of  the  electron  and  the  charge  distribution of  the 

positron  on  the  other  side  of  the  three-dimensional  interface  should  cancel  any  electric  field  from 

manifesting within “our” three-dimensional space; just as the field is cancelled outside a charged capacitor. 

Thus, the model gives, in addition, a plausible reason why there cannot be an electric field around a solitary 

electron. Furthermore, the electron has a “soft” radius given by RO. This radius shrinks when electrons are 

scattered from  each other (see  section 11.5). Thus, it is not surprising that such experiments indicate that 

the electron radius is  extremely small. In addition, when classical electrodynamics applies, the electron is 

experienced by another  test-charge from outside its  critical radius, so  that  the  test-charge will experience 

the centre of charge of the electron-wave as a point charge; consistent with all experiments to date! 

 

There  is  another  satisfactory  aspect  to  the  model.  According  to  Maxwell’s  equations 

electromagnetic waves  appear  when  charges  “oscillate relative  to  each  other”.  Why  does  an electron,  far 

away  from  other  matter,  radiate  electromagnetic  waves  when  it  is  accelerated  and,  in  addition,  always 

produces  the  same  radiation  for  the  same  acceleration?  Could  one  not  now  argue  that  such  accelerated 

motion  polarizes  the  electron’s  charge  relative  to  its  positive  charge  along  the  fourth  dimension,  and 

therefore an electromagnetic field appears? After all, the positive charge supplies the electron’s inertia and 

should thus try and drag the electron back, to in this way cause polarization and oscillatory motion relative 

to the electron. Furthermore, when charging a capacitor the Poynting vector is  in accordance with energy 

flowing into the capacitor from surrounding space. 

14.2 The Dirac equation 

Dirac  formulated  his  equation  for  a  single  free  electron  in  an  attempt  to  make  quantum  mechanics 

compatible with the special theory of relativity. According to the latter theory, the Hamilton-operator of an 

electron with mass me and momentum p, should be written as: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(34) 

=

H

22
pc

+

(
cm
e

)22

 

 

 

 

 

 

31

The  square  root  makes  it  very  difficult  to  solve  the  concomitant  time-independent  wave  equation.  Dirac 
tackled  the  problem  by  postulating  two  operators  α  and  β  which  he  used  to  reformulate  the  Hamilton 

operator: i.e. 

 

 

 

 

cH = α•p

β+

2cm e

 

 

 

 

(35) 

By using this Hamilton operator he could solve the wave equation to get stationary electron-wave solutions. 

He found that each of the resultant basis waves has to exist of two components (i.e. it is a so-called spinor); 

i.e.  it  has  a  direction  which  “explains”  the  spin  of  the  electron.  This  has  been  considered  as  a  great 

breakthrough  because  the  Schrödinger  equation  does  not  supply  a  reason  why  spin  should  manifest 

(however, see section 14.5 below). In addition, he found that there are also solutions with negative energies 
situated at an energy-interval equal to 2mec2 below the lowest energy of the electron (which is of course its 
rest mass energy mec2). This implies that a single electron cannot exist in free space; it should fall into one 
of  the  negative  energy  levels  and  disappear.  To  circumvent  this  problem,  Dirac  postulated  that  all  the 

negative energy-levels  are already  filled  with  electrons (forming  a  “Dirac  sea” of  unobservable  electrons 

within  the  vacuum)  and  therefore  an  electron  with  a  positive  energy  cannot  fall  into  them.  It  was  then 

pointed  out  by  him  that  if one of  the  negative-energy  electrons  can be  excited  by  a  photon  with  a  large 

enough  energy,  it  will  leave  a  positive  hole  behind,  which  should  act  like  a  positively-charged  particle. 

Therefore, it is widely accepted today that Dirac predicted the existence of the positron. 

 

But also in this case, should one not ask: relative to which reference frame are these solutions not 

changing? Should it not be relative to a proper inertial reference frame? If this is the case, why should one 

use a Hamilton operator that is  consistent with a particle moving at a very high speed relative to its own 

proper inertial  reference  frame?  Also in  this  case, one can  argue  that  the  uncertainty  in “momentum”, as 

measured relative to the proper inertial reference frame, should rather give the dimensions of the wave than 
its momentum relative to another inertial reference  frame.  In addition, the operators α and β seem rather 

contrived. The  appearance of  the electron spin is, however, a great plus point. It indicates that spin must 

have something to do with four-dimensional space-time. Another idea that caught on has been the existence 

of the “Dirac-sea”; i.e. that there is more to “the vacuum” than mere emptiness. This has led to the concept 

of “vacuum energy”. It, however, lies a bit uneasy on the mind that the equation is supposedly for a single 

electron in space, but the result has to be interpreted as a multi-particle solution. Nonetheless, the concept 

of  a  “vacuum  energy”  has  become  an  inherent  part  of  all  quantum  field  theories.  But  is  the  concept  of 

“vacuum energy” not just a red herring? 

14.3 Which wave equation for a free electron? 

Is  the  Dirac  equation  the  best  approach  when  one  models  a  free  electron?  My  intuition  says  no!  The 

Schrödinger equation is more like a regular wave equation than the Dirac  equation. The possibility does, 

however, exist that  the wave equation  for a free electron could be different  from both the Dirac equation 

 

 

 

 

 

32

and the Schrödinger equation; after all, in its time-independent format it has to calculate the rest mass of the 

electron if the postulates  in section 7 are valid. Furthermore, the interaction between the electron and  the 

positive  charge  along  the  fourth  dimension  might  require  a  four-dimensional  analogue  of  the  Coulomb 

equation. This possibility does not  fall within  the intended scope of this publication, and will  thus not be 

pursued  any  further  here.  Accordingly,  the  Schrödinger  equation  will  be  used  to  estimate  parameters 

relating to the  free electron in three-dimensional space. This implies that the solution in three-dimensions 

for the free electron relative to its proper inertial reference frame, could be similar to the lateral solution for 

h=0 of an external orbital on the surface of an n-type substrate. From Eqs. 2 and 25 one may thus venture to 

write that: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
The  frequency  ωe  is  determined  by  the  distance  Rw  along  the  fourth  dimension.  Assuming  that  the 

Schrödinger equation applies, one can write by analogy to Eq. (26) that:

(37) 

 
From these equations one can solve for Rw and ωe. By analogy to Eq. (28) one can then solve for 

er∆ . By 

then using Eq. (30), an estimate for the overlap radius ROf for the free electron can be obtained; it comes to: 

R

(38) 

 
For the s-orbital of a hydrogen atom, the corresponding value ∆rse calculated relative to the centre of charge 

of the orbital is equal to 3/2aB where aB is the Bohr radius. Accordingly, the overlap distance is given by: 

R

(39) 

 
The experimentally determined value for the van der Waal’s radius for the hydrogen atom is ≈1.2x10-10 m. 

The correspondence with the calculated overlap radius in Eq. (39) is remarkably good. 

14.4 The fourth dimension – dark energy? 

The interaction along the  fourth dimension should also add a wave- and an energy-component to the free 

electron.  The  problem  is  that  the  Schrödinger  equation  along  this  direction  does  not  seem  to  lead  to  a 

reasonable  solution;  for  example,  a  realistic  value  for  Rw  is  not  obtained.  As  already  mentioned,  the 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

33

solution along this direction probably requires one to use a four-dimensional analogue of Coulomb’s law. 

In  addition  it  probably  also  requires  a  better  understanding  of  how  general  relativity  and  quantum 

mechanics meshes. Nonetheless, there is an extra energy involved. Might this be the origin of dark energy? 

It is an exciting thought! 

 

This energy probably also relates to the energy that a wave in three-dimensional space can borrow 

subject to Heisenberg’ uncertainty relationship for energy and time (see section 11.1). This could be the so-

called  “vacuum  energy”  postulated  in  quantum  field  theory.  When  calculating  the  vacuum  energy 

according  to  quantum  field  theory,  an  infinite  amount  is  obtained  which  has  to  be  removed  by 

renormalisation. If the “vacuum energy”, however, relates to the fourth component of matter waves, it can 

never  be  equal  to  infinity,  because  the  total  amount  of  matter  is  not  infinite.  Furthermore,  this  wave 

component  along  the  fourth  dimension  might  be  responsible  for  keeping  contact  between  the  different 

components  of  a  holistic  wave entity that has split  up  into different parts  within three-dimensional  space 

(see section 11.2). 

14.5 Electron spin 

One  cannot  physically  visualise  why  the  Dirac  equation  gives  a  “spinor”  solution  for  the  spin  of  an 

electron.  Can  the  presently  proposed  approach  (based  on  the  principles  formulated  in  section  7)  give  a 

reason why an electron has spin? When a magnetic field with a vector potential A is switched on over an 

electron with charge –e the momentum operator that has to be used in the Schrödinger equation becomes: 

If a constant magnetic field B is applied, the applicable vector potential that satisfies the Coulomb gauge is 

the following: 

 

 

p

−−∇−= h

)e(

i

A  

A

1= B×r 
2

 

 

 

Both  A  and  r  must  be  perpendicular  to  B.  If  the  field  is  applied  along  the  z-axis  then  at  a  point  with 
spherical coordinate r,θ,φ the vector r in Eq. (41) has to be perpendicular to the z-axis and its magnitude is 

thus given by rsinφ. The vector potential can then be written as: 

A

1=

⎪B⎪rsinφeθ

φ

The unit vector eθ is  the one for the θ-coordinate. The corresponding Schrödinger equation along a radial 

direction r then becomes:

Thus the magnetic field increases the effective force constant from K to a value K/; i.e: 

This  also  manifests  as  a  change  in  the  distance  Rw  along  the  fourth  dimension.  By  using  Eq.  (19),  it  is

In  spherical  coordinates  φ  varies  from  zero  to  π,  so  that  for  all  values  of  φ  except  φ=0  and  φ=π,  Rw

/  is 

shorter than Rw. Thus the energy of the electron will be higher than the energy without the magnetic field 
except when φ=0 (spin up) or when φ=π (spin down). One expects that the electron must “relax” in some 

manner to make either φ=0 or φ=π. This seems to imply that the direction of the fourth dimension must re-

orientate in some way. If one now switches off the magnetic field and switches it on again along the same 

direction,  re-orientation  is  not  again  required,  so  that  the  spin  will  remain  the  same;  however,  if  the 

magnetic  field  is  switched  along  another  direction,  re-orientation  is  again  required.  This  is  exactly  how 

electron spin behaves, but in this case it is possible to visualise what is happening and why it is happening. 

One does not require a (probability) spin wave-function that defines a 50/50 probability distribution. The 

50/50 behaviour occurs naturally because either spin-up or spin-down can restore the energy of the electron 

to its  lowest  level.  If  this  requires  a  re-orientation of  four-dimensional  space  within  the  holistic electron 

wave, does it not also require a change in space-time around it? This indicates that it might be possible that 

a magnetic field could affect gravity. 

14.6 Free positrons 

If  matter and antimatter separated  over a  three-dimensional barrier, why  can we  observe  positrons?  Why 

not? If the energy supply is high enough there is no obvious reason why a situation cannot arise where an 

electron is situated on “the other side” of the barrier so  that the positron is observed on this side. Such a 

state will, however, not survive for very long; as has been well documented experimentally.

14.7 Excited electrons 

If the free electron is a ground-state holistic wave which can be calculated from a harmonic wave equation, 

then it is possible that an electron could have excited states. This would neatly explain the existence of the 

muon  and  the  tau  particles;  which  are  in  all  respects  like  an  electron  but  with  much  larger  masses. 

Obviously,  the  masses  of  these  two  particles  cannot  be  explained  by  the  higher  energy  harmonic  states 

given  by  Eq.  (25).  Since  the  fourth  dimension  also  plays  a  role  in  the  energy,  it  is  likely  that  when  an 

excited free electron forms, the distance along the fourth dimension Rw might also have to change. If one 

assumes  that  Eqs.  (36)  and  (37)  also  apply  to  the  muon  and  the  tau,  one  can  calculate  the  concomitant 

changes in Rw as a function of mass. The results for the electron, muon and tau, as normalised relative to 

the electron (me=1 and Rw=1) are compared in Fig. 5. A value for the proton is also included (see section 

15 below). 

The applicable relationship between the mass m (where m can be either me, mµ, mτ or mP) and the 

concomitant distances Rw can be derived and is given by:

The  fine structure  constant  α  has  been  inserted  for  fun!  According  to this  formula,  an  increase in mass-

energy causes  the distance Rw to decrease inversely. Is it possible that at very high energies this distance 

could become so small that the particle and its anti-particle along the fourth dimension combine to form a 

mini black hole; i.e. the excited electron “disappears” from “our” three-dimensional space? 

15. Nucleon bonding – a single fundamental force? 

If  an  electron  is  a  localised  wave  generated  by  a  restoring-force  manifesting  owing  to  the  presence  of  a 

positive charge across the fourth dimension, one expects that a proton could likewise be a localised, time-

independent wave  formed by  the presence of  a negative charge across the  fourth dimension. When doing 

the  same analysis as  for the  electron, one can also derive  an overlap parameter  for the  proton. Using  the 

proton’s mass to determine its critical radius it is found that:

(47) 

 
The experimentally determined radius of the proton is ≈10-15 m. One  might now be brave and venture to 

argue that  the radius of  the proton has not been determined accurately  enough by experiment; i.e.  it  is in 

reality  the  same  as  the  overlap  radius  derived  from  the  model,  which  assumes  that  the  proton,  like  the 

electron, is a localised holistic wave-entity which forms within the electric-field of an anti-proton separated 

from it along the fourth dimension. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

36

It  has  been  concluded  that  chemical  bonding  occurs  when  the  critical  radii  of  atomic  electron-

orbitals overlap (see section 10). It thus seems attractive to conclude that nucleon bonding should similarly 

occur  when  the  critical  radii  of  two  adjacent  protons  overlap;  however,  the  latter  requires  very  high 

energies to achieve, because when two protons approach one another, their critical radii must shrink in the 

direction of their approach (as explained for free electrons in section 11.5). This will, however, not happen 

when  a  proton  and  a  neutron  approach  one  another.  This  is  so  because  the  proton-charge  will  then 

experience the  neutron-wave  as  uncharged. Is  it then  not  possible  that  an electron  and  neutrino entangle 

with a proton in order to form a neutron, which can then bond quantum-mechanically with the proton in a 

similar way  as electrons form chemical bonds. If  this scenario is correct, it would imply  that there are no 

separate  “short-range”  nuclear  forces.  The  weak  force  relates  to  the  entanglement  of  a  proton  with  an 

electron-neutrino, and the strong force to a “chemical-type” entanglement of a proton and a neutron; i.e. the 

same quantum-mechanical mechanism might be responsible for both chemical and nucleon bonding. This 

further implies  that that there is only one fundamental force in  the universe, namely  the  electro-magnetic 

force  (excluding  gravity  which  according  to  Einstein  is  not  a  force  at  all  but  relates  to  space-time 

curvature). Einstein has  always  claimed that  the only  fundamental  force is electromagnetic! Furthermore, 

the localised waves generated for a free electron and a free proton, are given by the ground state solutions 

of the appropriate wave equation when it is solved within the electric fields of the charges across the fourth 

dimension. This  implies that both these particles should have excited states. Would it not be ironic if  the 

“fundamental particles” have  all along been the  electron, proton, neutrino and photon, while all  the other 

“particles” are just excited states of the electron and the proton? 

It  has  been  deduced  from  proton-proton  scattering  experiments  that  protons,  in  contrast  to 

electrons, have “internal structure” which is at present ascribed to the presence of quarks. A free quark has 

not  yet  been  generated.  Much  larger  energies  are  involved  for  proton-proton  scattering  than  electron-

electron scattering. Might it be possible that the protons can form excited states that have been modeled by 

invoking quarks  and  gluons?  The  allowed  excited states  of the  proton might thus  be quite  different  from 

those for the electron and this might relate to different interactions along the fourth dimension. As already 

mentioned  in  section  10.4,  to  understand  this  probably  requires  a  better  understanding  of  how  quantum 

mechanics meshes with the general theory of relativity along the lines suggested in the present publication. 

This does  not,  however, imply that all  the  work that has been  done on quantum  field theory  and  particle 

physics  has  been  futile.  All  the  collected  data and their  symmetrical  interrelationships  could  give  insight 

into the role quantum-mechanical interactions play over the fourth dimension. 

16. Macro entanglement of matter 

16.1 Can matter macro-entangle? 

 

 

 

37

In  section  11.6  it  was  surmised  that  a  laser  beam  constitutes  a  macro-entanglement  of  photons.  For 

electrons it has been deduced (in section 11.2) that entanglement can only occur for pairs that have opposite 

 

8). 

 

spins; however, in section 10.3 it has been argued that when bi-electron orbitals overlap they might enmesh 

to  form  a  Bose-Einstein  condensate;  however,  in  the  example  considered  it  was  found  that  bi-electron, 

Gaussian waves might reach a critical overlap at which they lose their individual identities; i.e. there are no 

separate  bumps  to  distinguish  them  from  one  another.  Could  this  not  indicate  that  (at  that  point)  these 

Gaussian-shaped  waves  become  entangled,  to,  in  this  way,  form  a  single  holistic  macro-entanglement; 

similar to photons forming a laser beam, but now consisting entirely of electrons? In fact an experimental 

result has been “stumbled upon” which seems to imply that this is exactly what happens.  

16.2 An experiment with electrons 

The original purpose of the experiment was to test diamond for cold-cathode action [4,9]. The diamond was 

doped n-type by oxygen-ion implantation. To ensure that the near-surface region had a very high density of 

donors,  the  implantation  was  done  within  a  plasma-reactor  at  a  high  vacuum.  The  idea  was  to  try  and 

extract  electrons  by  means  of  an  anode  from  the  doped  diamond  at  room  temperature.  It  has  been 

speculated that this might be possible in the case of diamond if it has negative electron affinity (see section 

The expected mechanism was as follows: When applying an electric field between the anode and a 

back  contact  to  the  diamond,  electrons  should  start  to  flow  from  the  diamond  into  the  gap  between  the 

anode and diamond surface. These electrons will  leave behind a positively-charged depletion layer below 

the surface of the diamond which attracts the electrons back towards the diamond [4,10]; i.e. an equilibrium 

dipole layer  forms  that  cancels the  applied  field.  At a  high enough voltage  on the  anode, the  gap  should 

become  filled with electrons (from the diamond’s surface right up to the anode’s surface). They can then 

act as charge carriers, and a current should then start to flow from the diamond to the anode, provided that 

the electrons within the conduction band of the diamond can tunnel through the depletion layer. It is for the 

latter reason that the dopant density has to be made very high near the surface of the diamond. The beauty 

is  that  this  experiment  worked  first  time  exactly  as  described  above;  i.e.  after  reaching  a  suitable  anode 

voltage, which depends on the distance between the anode and diamond surface (the gap-width) a current 

initiated and started to flow. Cold cathode action is possible! Diamond has negative electron affinity! 

 

When moving through the switching voltage slowly, the current was found to show instability; it 

increased  and  fell away until  one  moved  through  the  critical voltage, whence  it  stabilised.  This jumping 

around in the current can be ascribed to electrons entering the anode, thus causing the number of electrons 

in the gap to decrease so that the  current falls away, followed by an increase of these electrons  from the 

depletion layer until there are again enough of them to enter the anode again; i.e. the electrons in the gap 

are  accelerating  and  decelerating all  the  time. A more  fascinating observation  was made  after  the  device 

had been switched on so that a stable current was flowing. When reducing the voltage, it did not switch off. 

In fact, in order to reduce the current to zero, the voltage had to be reduced to zero. Furthermore, when then 

increasing the voltage in  the negative direction,  electrons started  to  flow from the  anode to  the diamond! 

Since the anode was a metal without any negative electron affinity, this was quite an astonishing result. In 

 

38

addition  one  could  switch  off  the  equipment  for  weeks.  When  subsequently  switching  it  on,  it  still 

conducted  current  without  having  to  first  increase  to  a  critical  voltage.  One  could  even  let  air  into  the 

system without changing the current. This could be done for voltages that, without the  conducting phase, 

would cause  a plasma discharge which damaged the diamond and the anode.  Intensive experiments were 

lodged  to  see  whether  this  was  not  caused  by  contamination;  however,  it  had  to  be  concluded  that  just 

before the  phase  forms,  the  device behaved and switched  exactly  as  expected  for  electrons;  so  whatever 

was happening must relate to the presence of electrons within the gap. 

 

The device was then again analysed theoretically. It was realised that even after the current started 

to  flow,  there  will  still  be  an  electric  field  over  the  depletion  layer  below  the  diamond’s  surface  which 

cannot be balanced by a further increase in the width of the layer of electrons outside the surface; i.e. the 

width cannot expand further than the surface of the anode. Thus the depletion layer will try to increase the 

width  of  the  electron-layer  by  keeping  on  injecting  electrons  into  the  gap between  the  diamond  and  the 

anode.  Instead  of  achieving  an  increase  in  the  field,  the  density  of  charge-carriers  within  the  gap  will 

increase; more electrons are thus available to transport the current so that it causes a concomitant decrease 

in  the  electric  field  within  the  gap.  To  reach  an  equilibrium  current,  as  required  by  the  second  law  of 

thermodynamics,  the depletion layer must stop adding electrons. This will only happen when the electric 

field  over  the  depletion  layer  and  the  gap  becomes  identically  zero.  This  implies  that  an  equilibrium 

current,  as  experimentally  measured,  can  only  flow  through  the  gap  if  there  is  no  field  between  the 

diamond’s  surface  and  the  anode.  This  is  the  definition  of  superconduction!  Thus  in  order  for  the 

experimental result to manifest, as it did and still does, the electrons within the gap must in some way form 

a superconducting phase. 

 

An independent evaluation of the above experiment has recently been initiated at the University of 

KwaZulu-Natal [11]. This work has so far been in accord with the previous findings and has also generated 

new  insights.  The  equipment  for  the  latter  experiments  has  been  constructed  in  such  a  way  that  the  gap 

between the diamond surface and the anode can be observed by means of a microscope. It has been found 

that (at the switching voltage) during the time that the current was jumping around, light sparks emanated 

from the gap; just as one would expect for electrons accelerating and decelerating. Once above the critical 
voltage a perfect black cylinder with a diameter of ≈1 µm immediately appeared between the anode and the 

surface of the diamond (see Fig. 6 for a schematic representation). The colour is exactly what one expects 

for  a  superconducting  phase;  light  (electromagnetic  radiation)  cannot  enter  or  move  through  it.  When 

sending  large  currents  from  the  diamond  to  the  anode,  which  would  cause  any  other  material  of  similar 

thickness to glow white hot or melt, the phase still stayed black. In  fact, a current could be sent from  the 

diamond to the anode so that the anode (made of steel) started to melt. When opening the gap rapidly it is 

possible  to  break  the  cylinder.  When  a  piece  remains  on  the  anode  or/and  the  diamond’s  surface,  the 

cylinder  is slowly sucked  away  into  the  material  it  is  in  contact  with.  If on  the  other hand  the  voltage is 

increased,  the  cylinder  finally  re-establishes  contact  and  the  current  starts  to  flow  again.  Further 

experiments are in progress [11]. 

 

39

 

It is interesting to note  that the electron phase forms between positive charges on the anode and 

the cathode. Thus, it is reminiscent of a giant chemical bond; just like two electrons between two protons 

form a covalent bond one now has many electrons forming a single entity between the positive charges on 

the  anode  and  cathode  surface.  The  only  way that this can be  explained is  to  conclude that the  electrons 

have  entangled  to  form  a  single  holistic  entity.  How?  As  already  argued  above,  the  depletion  layer  will 

keep  on  adding  electrons  to  the  gap  as  long  as  there  is  an  electric  field  within  the  gap.  As  the  electron 

density  increases,  the  charge  carriers move  slower and slower;  in  fact they  approach zero velocity.  Each 

electron  experiences  an  average  positive  charge,  less  than  +e,  which  is  induced  jointly  by  the  positive 

charges  on  the  cathode  and  anode  and  the  other  surrounding  electrons,  and  thus  starts  to  morph  into  a 

Gaussian-shaped wave by “vibrating” through the induced virtual positive charge. With a further increase 

in  electron  density  these  Gaussian  waves  finally  reach  overlap  so  that  bi-electron  Gaussian  waves  form, 

which, in turn, finally reach overlap to entangle with the formation of a single holistic macro-wave within 

which time does not manifest. 

There are thus no separate charge-carriers anymore; so how does charge-transport manifest? The 

conclusion one has to reach is that a current cannot flow “through” such a phase because this requires time 

to manifest within  the wave-entity. Charge-transport has to occur by  “teleportation”. When  electrons  are 

injected  at  the  cathode  they  entangle  with  the  wave  and  thus  change  the  wave’s  energy.  According  to 

Heisenberg’s uncertainty relationship for energy and time, this change in energy can only be tolerated for a 

limited  time.  Accordingly,  electrons  disentangle  at  the  anode  and  flow  into  the  anode.  Faster  than  light 

signal transfer is thus possible just as in the case of an EPR experiment. 

16.3 An experiment with buckey balls 

It has been reported in the literature  that buckey balls  can  diffract at low enough temperatures [12]; even 

though such a structure is known to consist of many carbon atoms. When the temperature is increased, the 

diffraction  pattern  becomes  “washed  out” and  finally  disappears.  Furthermore, emission  of  photons  from 

the  buckey  balls  causes  the  diffraction  pattern  to  disappear.  This  also  happens  when  the  vacuum 

deteriorates so that the buckey balls start to regularly encounter gas molecules. According to the discussion 

in section 11.4, this implies that a buckey ball must be able to enmesh with the diffraction slits and move 

through both of them, and this is only possible for a holistic wave within which time does not manifest; i.e. 

the buckey ball must for some reason be able to become an entangled single entity when it is cooled to low 

temperatures. When the temperature increases, the buckey  ball changes  from being an entangled entity to 

become an enmeshed entity; this is required for it to be able to emit photons. Therefore it cannot enmesh 

with the slits as a single holistic entity in order to diffract. 

When the vacuum pressure increases, the temperature does not, so that the buckey balls should not 

change from an entangled to an enmeshed entity; however, they now “encounter” the gas atoms, and each 

encounter  localises  the  buckey ball.  Thus after  a  buckey ball passed  through both  slits  simultaneously,  it 

 

 

 

40

will be localised on the other side of the slits before its component-parts which moved through the two slits 

can interfere to form a diffraction pattern. 

16.4 Dark matter? 

If buckey balls can become entangled, can this not also occur for much larger masses of neutrally-charged 

materials? Could this not be the origin of dark matter in  the universe? Such matter would be totally inert 

and unobservable because it is unlikely that it will interact with baryonic matter or light in a way that will 

make  it  “visible”.  It  should  primarily  manifest  its  presence  through  gravity.  This  seems  to  be  a  good 

description of the properties of the dark matter which is believed to be present in “our” universe. If the dark 

matter  in  “our”  universe  does  consists  of  very  large  volumes  of  entangled  matter,  might  it  not  supply 

pathways  to  the stars? If one  could get a  spaceship to entangle with such an entity it might be teleported 

over distances of light years; similar to electrons being teleported from the cathode to the anode through a 

holistic superconducting phase (see section 16.2). 

17. Creation of the universe – bending space? 

17.1 Four-dimensional space, time, temperature and entropy 

From Einstein’s theories of relativity it is known that “our” universe exists against the backdrop of curved 

four-dimensional space-time. In this publication it is proposed that holistic wave entities exist within which 

time  does  not  manifest;  so  that  the  entity  is  in  immediate  contact  with  itself  over  the  whole  volume  it 

occupies in three-dimensional space. The proposed model for the electron in section 7, leads to a solution 

where  a  four-dimensional  Euclidean  space  manifests  “within”  the  electron;  i.e.  the  fourth  dimension  is 

perpendicular to  three-dimensional space. Does  this  not  indicate  that  four-dimensional  space-time  cannot 

be Euclidean; i.e. for time to manifest the fourth axis cannot be perpendicular to three-dimensional space? 

The latter deduction makes perfect mathematical sense. In a Euclidean space the coordinates along 

the axes are linearly independent; i.e. differentiating any one of them with another gives a zero result. Thus, 

if  time  exists  along  an  axis  which  is  perpendicular  to  three-dimensional  space,  one  will  not  be  able  to 

differentiate  any  space  coordinate  with  time  in  order  to  calculate  a  velocity;  i.e.  kinetics  will  not  be 

possible! If kinetics is not possible within  four-dimensional Euclidean space, it  implies that such a space 

can  also  not  manifest  either  temperature  or  entropy;  i.e.  it  manifests  “perfect  order”  and  immediate 

connectivity. 

At the event horizon of a black hole time stops. A black hole is modelled as a singularity in space-

time which  is  “cloaked”  by  its  event horizon.  Is  it  not maybe  possible  that  this  singularity  is a  “virtual” 

entity similar to an image charge? Maybe the event horizon is a direct interface between “our” universe and 

the “surrounding”, timeless four-dimensional Euclidean space. Could one not argue that there is no barrier 

along  the  fourth  dimension  at  the  event  horizon;  and  therefore  matter  and  light  can  move  from  “our” 

 

 

 

 

 

 

41

universe to again “coalesce” with the timeless, zero-entropy, four-dimensional Euclidean space that exists 

as “nothingness around our universe”? 

17.2 Alpha and omega 

 

 

 

 

Every  space  has  a  reciprocal  space.  When  the  space  is  perfectly  isotropic  and  Euclidean  it  is  its  own 

reciprocal space. As already asked above: could this not imply that “before creation” the universe was an 

infinite  four-dimensional  Euclidean  space?  At  creation,  or  the  so-called  Big  Bang,  a  region  of  the  four-

dimensional Euclidean space became “bent”, so that our space and its reciprocal space started to separate. 

Matter and antimatter separated across a three-dimensional barrier, which we now experience as our three-

dimensional vacuum.  If  all this matter initially consisted of entangled dark matter, this matter might have 

near-instantaneously morphed to cause rapid inflation of “our” universe from a small size to a stupendous 

size; after which baryonic matter started to “precipitate” out. This might be the reason why most matter is 

still  in the  form  of  dark matter.  Furthermore,  this  could  be the reason why  matter  precipitated  out  in  the 

same  manner  even  when  separated  by  light  years.  “Time”  does  not  exist  “within”  the  dark  matter  from 

which  normal  matter  precipitated;  i.e.  all  baryonic matter  is  the “offspring”  of the  same  “mother-matter” 

which is, or was, everywhere  in instantaneous contact with “herself”. In addition, the formation of space-

time, owing to the bending of the time-axis, made the passage of time and the existence of light to manifest. 

This also  enabled the baryonic matter,  which  have  “precipitated” out,  to  experience  kinetic change.  This 

would  imply  that  “during  creation”  a  high  entropy  state  “jumped”  into  existence  from  zero  entropy 

surroundings. So are we living in a cosmos that is evolving from high entropy to even higher entropy? This 

seems  unlikely. Maybe  our  cosmos is  expanding  in  order  to  “un-curve” so  that  at  the  end  of  time  it will 

again “completely” merge with its infinite, timeless surroundings. This would imply that the arrow of time 

is determined by a decrease of the total entropy of “our” cosmos. Maybe this is why order crystallises out 

in  the  form  of  living  beings  and plants?  It  is  interesting  to  speculate  further  that  if  our  cosmos  is  just  a 

localised region within an infinite four-dimensional Euclidean space, then there might be many more such 

regions. So maybe our cosmos is not as unique as we want to believe. 

18. Summary and conclusion 

In summary, the following postulates and conclusions emerged: 

(i) 

The  building  blocks  of  matter  might  be  holistic  fields  (waves)  within  which  time  does  not 

manifest. 

(ii) 

The essence of each holistic matter-wave is contained within a volume, the size of which is 

defined in any direction by a critical radius, where this radius is equal to the “uncertainty” in 
position relative to the centre of mass of the wave multiplied with an overlap parameter (β); 

the latter seems to have a universal value equal to the square root of two. 

(iii) 

The  mass  of  a  holistic  matter-wave  is  equal  to  its  quantum-mechanical  energy  calculated 

(from a time-independent wave equation) relative to its proper inertial reference frame. 

42

(iv) 

A holistic matter-wave can near-instantaneously change in shape and size (morph) when the 

boundary  conditions change or when it coalesces (entangles) with a photon in order to form 

another,  higher-energy,  holistic  matter-wave  entity.  Similarly,  the  morphing  is  also  near-

instantaneous when it disentangles into sub-waves. 

(v) 

Holistic matter-waves can superpose in two ways; (a) they can “enmesh” without losing their 

holistic individual  identities or (b) they can “entangle” to  form another holistic matter-wave 

within which time also does not manifest. 

(vi) 

Light waves can also enmesh or entangle; as well as morph from being vast extended holistic 

standing-wave entities to form localised photons when the boundary conditions change. 

It has been argued here that these concepts lead to a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics which can 

be  visualised.  Diffraction  and  EPR  phenomena  are  explained  as  outcomes  which  should  be  expected  to 

manifest  when  waves  interact.  The  photo-electric  effect  and  Compton  scattering  have  been  modelled  in 

terms of matter-waves entangling with light-waves. It has been deduced that chemical bonding and nucleon 

bonding most probably relate to  the same quantum-mechanical mechanism; i.e. excluding gravity  there is 

only  one  fundamental  force  in  nature  namely  the  electromagnetic  force.  Indications,  of  how  quantum 

mechanics and general relativity might relate to each other, emerged. It has been deduced and proposed that 

“dark energy” most probably relates to the energy of a wave component (of matter-waves) along the fourth 

dimension, while “dark matter” could be large macro-entangled matter waves within which time does not 

manifest. A possible explanation for the absence of antimatter “within our universe” emerged. A plausible 

reason has been proposed for the uniformity of cosmic background radiation. 

I would like to thank Terry Doyle for allowing me to quote some of his unpublished results. Over the last 

three  years  I  have  had  numerous  discussions  with  my  friend  and  colleague  Roger  Wedlake.  I  am  very 

grateful for his support and enthusiasm. These discussions and especially his incisive questions have been

extremely useful.

waves. The dashed curves show them when they are far away from each other. The solid curve shows them 

when they are near the critical overlap distance that corresponds to the Mott transition. When they reach the 

Mott critical distance, the dimple between them disappears. 

Fig.  4:  Afshar’s  experiment:  This  experiment  demonstrates  that  both  wave  and  particle  behaviour  can 

manifest in the same experiment. This violates Bohr’s principle of complementarity. 

Fig.  5:  A  possible  relationship  between  the  distance  Rw  over  the  fourth  dimension  and  the  mass  of  a 

particle. The data has been normalised relative to the electron so that the mass me of the electron as well as 

its concomitant distance Rw are both equal to unity. 

Fig. 6: The shape and form of an entangled superconducting phase, consisting entirely of electrons, which 

form between the surface of an n-type diamond and an anode after a suitable electron-extraction potential 

has been applied.

Abstract 
 
The beam transport system for the Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF) anticipates multiple 
beam splitters [1]. Monitoring two separated beams in a common beam pipe in the splitter 
sections imposes certain requirements on diagnostics for these sections. In this note we 
explore a two-beam system in a generic beam monitor and study the feasibility of resolving the 
positions of the two beams with a single diagnostic device.

1. Introduction.  
 
In the Advanced Hydrotest Facility (AHF), 20-ns beam pulses (bunches) are extracted from the 50-GeV 
main proton synchrotron and then are transported to the target by an elaborated transport system [1]. 
The beam transport system splits the beam bunches into equal parts in its splitting sections so that up to 
12 synchronous beam pulses can be delivered to the target for the multi-axis proton radiography. 
Information about the transverse positions of the beams in the splitters, and possibly the bunch 
longitudinal profile, should be delivered by some diagnostic devices. Possible candidates are the circular 
wall current monitors in the circular pipes connecting the splitter elements, or the conventional stripline 
BPMs [2]. In any case, we need some estimates on how well the transverse positions of the two beams 
can be resolved by these monitors.  
 
To this end, let us consider a problem illustrated in Fig. 1. We make the following assumptions: (i) the 
vacuum chamber has an arbitrary cross section S that does not change as the beams move along the 
ω βγ (cid:1) , where ω is 
chamber axis z; (ii) the chamber walls are perfectly conducting; and (iii)

1γ(cid:2) , and the long-wavelength limit when, for a 
. For the AHF beam transport system with 50-GeV 

velocity, and 
. The first condition means that the chamber cross section is the same in the 
vicinity of the diagnostic device, at least along a chamber segment a few times longer than 2b. The last 
condition includes both the ultra relativistic limit, 
fixed γ, the wavelength of interest 
protons and b on the order of 10 cm, the condition (iii) above is satisfied up to rather high frequencies, 
 GHz. As a result, the problem of calculating the beam transverse fields and 
as high as 
the corresponding induced currents in the chamber walls is reduced to a two-dimensional electrostatic 
problem. Essentially the same problem was studied in Ref. [3], where an arbitrary transverse beam 
current distribution was considered. In our case, the beam charge distribution is just a sum of the two 
(cid:3)
distributions, one with its center at the first beam position  1r
approach as [3], we calculate the transverse electric field created by the two beams at an arbitrary point

To simplify all calculations below, we first assume that both beams have the same (unit) charge per unit 
length and their charge distributions are axially symmetric around their axes. It was demonstrated that in 

 

the case of an axisymmetric charge distribution the field produced by the beam on the wall is the same 
as that of the pencil beam traveling along the distribution axis [3]. The beam-size corrections due to 
asymmetries of the beam current distributions are known [3], so that they can be included later. Also, to 
further simplify our consideration, let us consider the case of a circular cylindrical pipe. 
 
2. Transverse Fields of Two Beams with Equal Currents.  
 
In a circular cylindrical pipe of radius b, a pencil beam with the unit charge per unit length and a

the beam transverse positions completely, one needs, in principle, only to know the field (2.3) in four 
different points to find the beam positions. However, because the relations between the fields and the 
beam parameters are nonlinear, there is no guarantee that these four equations will allow us to find all 4 
beam parameters from only 4 field measurements. Let us choose points R=(b,0), T=(0,b), L=(-b,0), 
B=(0,-b) as the points where the fields (or induced currents) are measured, see Fig. 1. These points can 
be locations of narrow striplines in a BPM or of resistors in a wall current monitor. Denoting

Obviously, the first two ratios, Eqs. (2.17-18), give information about the position of the center of the 
combined charge distribution for two beams, while the last one, Eq. (2.19), can be used to extract info 
on the beam separation. If we assume the beams are separated mainly in the horizontal plane, i.e.

The results above are derived under the assumption that the two beams are pencil-like, or equivalently,

size corrections. For example, assume first that both beams have the same normalized double-Gaussian 
charge distribution in their transverse cross sections,

It should be noted at this point that the results above can be generalized to more general transverse beam 
charge distributions. As was demonstrated in [3], within the framework of our consideration, all beam-
size corrections (shown in blue in Eqs. (2.23-28)) enter the expressions for fields and signals via their 
multipole moments. In particular, all corrections up to the third order include only the quadrupole

One should note that in a general case of two non-symmetric beam-charge distributions, there will be

As for the beam-spot corrections, they can be obtained from results [3] in a way similar to that used 
above. The beam-size corrections to Eqs. (3.3-5) for the case of two different arbitrary symmetric 
distributions of the beam current in the beam transverse cross sections, can be obtained by replacing the 
size correction terms (highlighted in blue) in Eqs. (2.23-28) as follows:

are reduced to Eqs. (2.17-19), or to Eqs. (2.26-28), if the beam-size corrections are taken into account.

These expressions should be compared with Eqs. (2.30). The last two ratios will be close to those from 
Eqs. (2.30) as long as the charge misbalance is not too big, while the first one receives a correction (the

These results are to be compared with those given by Eqs. (2.31-33). One should note that ratio (3.9) 
gets a correction already in the leading order, while for (3.10) and especially (3.11) one can expect 
noticeable corrections only for large values of the beam separation and / or of charge misbalance. 
 
4. Results for Relevant Values of Parameters.  
  
According to the preliminary design of the AHF splitter sections [1,4], the two split beamlets look as 
shown in Fig. 2. The horizontal beam separation g, from one cut edge to the other, increases from 5 mm 
near the entrance of the pulsed magnetic septum to about 5.2 cm at the entrance of the first DC magnetic 
septum. From beam simulations [4], the transverse beam-charge distribution in the beamlets can be 
approximated as the semi-elliptic double-Gaussian one, cf. Tab. 1, with rms values 
σ =
y

, and 
. The vacuum pipe ID changes from 2” to 4”. Since the center-to-center horizontal beam 
g= + ∆ , see in Tab. 1, the ratio |

b  varies from rather small values to above 1 along 
xd (cid:5)

separation 
the beam splitter. For example, at the entrance of the pulsed magnetic septum 
b =
xd
/
the beam splitters are anticipated in the AHF beam transport system: most will produce equal beamlet 
currents (1:1 splitters), but some may be needed to split the input beam with the current ratio 2:1. While 
the ratio of split beam intensities will vary, it is reasonable to expect it to be near 1 or 2, respectively,  
within a few percent. Based on these values, we explore the misbalance parameter k in the range of 0.3-
0.7. Some results for the signal ratios are presented in Figs. 3-6.

As one can see from Figs. 3, the horizontal beam separation can be found reliably from the quadrupole 
signal ratio  (

charge misbalance. While we have not introduced beam-size effects in Figs. 3, these effects will not 
change the results significantly, according to Eqs. (2.28) and (3.6).

assumed narrow striplines in BPMs, for simplicity. Should a finite azimuthal width φ of BPM

5. Summary. 
 
The transverse fields produced by two separated beams in a vacuum chamber have been calculated. It 
was demonstrated in the case of a relatively large horizontal beam separation in a circular vacuum 
chamber that combining signal (induced current) measurements in four points on the chamber walls 
, 
allows us to reliably determine the horizontal beam separation 
even if two beams have intensities that differ by a factor of 2, cf. Eqs. (3.11), (3.8), and (3.7). Finding 
the vertical position 

ya  of the beam charge center is also relatively easy from the signal ratio 
, see Eqs. (3.10) and (3.7). However, if no additional information on the current ratio of two 
T B S
(
beams (e.g., from beam current monitors somewhere in downstream sections where the two beams are 
xa  of the 
in two different beam pipes) is available, it will be difficult to recover the horizontal position 
beam charge center from the signal ratios, see (3.9), (3.7). As for the vertical separation

we expect

d(cid:2) . For the particular parameters of the AHF beam splitters, when the ratio of beam 
currents is known by design or from independent measurements with beam current monitors, one can 
derive the parameters 
measurements with a simple four-stripline BPM within an accuracy of a few percent. The beam-size 
corrections calculated for this case based on results of beam-dynamics simulations [4] are small. These 
conclusions can be checked using bench measurements with two wires [2]. 
 
In conclusion, one should emphasize that only a specific case of two well-separated beams in a simple 
pickup system is explored. A more general analysis with a multistrip monitor using discrete FFT signal 
processing (e.g., see [6]) can recover higher geometrical moments of the beam charge distribution. Such 
a system can be combined with a wall current monitor, but it will be definitely much more complicated.

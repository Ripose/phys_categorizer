Abstract

There has been much interest in the blowout regime of plasma wakefield acceleration

(PWFA), which features ultra-high fields and nonlinear plasma motion.  Using  an  exact

analysis,  we  examine  here  a  fundamental  limit  of  nonlinear  PWFA  excitation,  by  an

infinitesimally short, relativistic electron beam. The beam energy loss in this case is shown

to be linear in charge even for nonlinear plasma response, where  a  normalized,  unitless

charge exceeds unity. The physical basis for this effect is discussed, as are deviations from

linear behavior observed in simulations with finite length beams.

The transfer of energy from short, intense electron beams to collective electron plasma

oscillations,  known  as  plasma  wakefields,  has  been  discussed  in  the  context  of  the  

plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA)[1-4]. While the original proposal for the PWFA

and related concepts was in the linear regime[1,2], where the plasma oscillations can be

considered small perturbations about equilibrium, highly nonlinear regimes have recently

been favored[3].  For example, in the highly nonlinear “blow-out” regime[4], the plasma

electrons are ejected from the channel of the intense driving electron beam, resulting in an

an electron-rarefied region with excellent  quality electrostatic focusing fields, as well as

longitudinal electromagnetic fields, which can, in tandem, stably accelerate and contain a

trailing electron beam. While the beam dynamics in this regime are linear and analytically

tractable, the plasma dynamics are not, and most predictions concerning plasma behavior

in the blow-out regime have been deduced from numerical simulations.

Despite the lack of analytical models for the nonlinear plasma response, it has been

noted in a number of studies[5-8] that the beam energy loss rate in the PWFA blow-out

regime obeys scaling usually associated with the  interaction  of  charged  particles  with

linear media[9].  This scaling predicts that the energy loss rate is proportional  to  the

square  of  the  plasma  frequency[9], 

2 .  As  the  efficient  excitation  of  an  oscillatory

p

system by a pulse occurs when the pulse in short compared with the oscillator period[5-

8], this scaling further implies that the PWFA driving beam's energy loss rate is proport-

ional to the inverse square of the driving beam's rms pulse length, 

z . This prediction has

led to a number of experiments that employ bunch compressors in order to decrease 

z ,

thus dramatically increasing the transfer of beam energy to the plasma. In recent measure-

ments with compressed beam at FNAL[10], the trailing portion of a  5  nC,  14  MeV,

z =1.2 mm, beam pulse was nearly stopped in 8 cm of  n0

@ 1014  cm-3 plasma, a deceler-

ation rate of over 150 MeV/m.  The large collective field observed in this as well as other

recent PWFA experiments[10,11], was obtained the context of nonlinear plasma electron

motion, thus re-opening the issue of wakefield scaling validity. In addition, it has recently

been a proposed to use ultra-short, high charge beams to drive PWFA in  the  tens  of

GeV/m range, for creation of an ultra-high energy plasma accelerator[8,12,13]. This paper

is primarily intended to address the underlying physics of the linear-like wakefield scaling

of relativistic beam energy loss in plasma, and to study deviations from this scaling.

To examine the relevant physics, we perform an analysis of the motion of cold plasma

electrons with equilibrium density  n0 (equal and opposite in charge density to the ions,

which are assumed stationary) as they are excited by a relativistic (vb

The results of our analysis will be made more transparent by the adoption of unitless

Note that use of Eq. 4 imply that we are assuming a steady-state response (wave ansatz),

where t and z occur only in the combination t - z /c . With these variables,  we may write a
general equation for the azimuthal component of  ˜ H 

In addition to the governing equation for  ˜ H , we will need relationships between fields and

current sources,

In this analysis the induced  ˜ E z  is found  most  directly  by  determining  the  transverse

current, as is customary in media-stimulated radiation calculations (cf. Jackson, Ref. 9).

Equation 7 is nonlinear, but may be simplified by assuming small amplitude response,
in which the  ˜ n ,  ˜ E i  and  ˜ H i  are small compared to unity. In fact, to place our results in

perspective, we must begin with a review of previous work in  the  linear  regime[1,2].

From the viewpoint of the fluid equations, linearity importantly implies that the plasma
r v = r p / me.  Also,  in  order  to  illustrate  the
electron  response  is  nonrelativistic,  i.e. 
  
dependence of  ˜ E z  on transverse beam size, we assume a disk-like beam, uniform up to
radius  ˜ a = kpa <<1, and  -function in 
to the plasma, and integrate over the  -function in Eq. 8 to obtain  ˜ H  = ˜ E r  before, during,

noted in this regard that the experiments of Refs. 10 and 11 have beam-plasma systems
yielding  ˜ Q  values between 2 and 4 — values of  ˜ Q  indicate that the beam is denser than

the plasma as long as kpa  and kp

Several comments arise from inspection of Eq. 15. The first is that the scaling of   Ez  with

respect to wavenumber  k  is dominated by the  factor  kp

2   that  is  typical  of  Cerenkov

radiation[9], if we interpret  kp  as the maximum allowable value of k radiated. The second

comment is that the linear result is ill-behaved  in the limit of  kp a<<1, as Eq. 15 predicts
a logarithmic divergence in  Ez . This pathology is a result of allowing  ˜ J r  (through  H ) to
- 1 . Previous analyses by Jackson[9] and Chen,  et al.,[1] have attempted to

diverge as  r

mitigate this problem for the point charge limit by introducing a lower bound on  r  (or

impact parameter b), and have chosen the Debye length1. This  ad hoc way of removing

the  divergence  of  an  ultra-relativistic  particle’s  energy  loss  in  plasma  has  a  dubious

physical basis, however.  Debye shielding places the scale of maximum  distance that a

particle’s macroscopic field can be observed in the plasma, after a thermal equilibrium is

established by the motion of the plasma electrons. However, here we are concerned with

the  minimum  distance  for  which  the  fluid  analysis  is  valid  in  describing  the  plasma

electron response to an extremely fast transient, a particle with velocity much higher than

the plasma electron thermal velocity.

As  ˜ Q  is raised, we must consider the plasma electrons’ relativistic response to large
amplitude fields, where  ˜ H  = ˜ E r . It is most straightforward to evaluate this response in

the rest frame of the beam[14], where the beam charge gives rise to only an electrostatic

field. One can then find the radial momentum kick in this frame, and Lorentz transform

back to the lab fram to obtain  ˜ p r  and  ˜ p z . We  therefore find

1 It is not quite clear from Jackson’s discussion if the Debye length is to be applied as the lower bound to b
only in the case to non-relativistic particles (cf. Ex. 13.3, Ref. 9).

For large H , the plasma electrons experience a large forward momentum impulse, and can

have relativistic vz  just after passage of the beam2. Equations 16 and 17 were verified by

numerical  integration  in  pulses  of  finite  length;  with  their  use  the  plasma  electron’s

transverse velocity becomes

In order to relate this  ˜ v r  to  ˜ J r  we must multiply by  ˜ n , which due to the change in  ˜ v z

directly after passage of the beam, is predicted with the aid of  Eq.  17 to be

Thus we are led to the remarkable result that the relativistically correct induced radial

current is identical to the approximate, linear, non-relativistic expression,

 Since the induced  ˜ J r  is unchanged from the linear case, the analysis of the decelerating
field  ˜ E z  leading to Eq.  13 remains valid.  Thus we see that the “linear” scaling observed in

simulations of short pulse beam-excited  wakefields may  be  understood  partly  on  an

analytical basis.  The result in Eq. 20 arises from two effects which cancel each other: the

induced  ˜ v r  saturates (at  a  value  well  below  1),  yet  the  density  enhancement  due  to

longitudinal motion — a “snow-plowing” of the plasma electrons by the electromagnetic
pressure  — exactly makes up for this saturation, and the induced  ˜ J r  remains linear in  ˜ Q .

This snow-plowing is analogous to the scenario from laser wake-field acceleration, where

the electromagnetic pressure in gradient of a short, intense laser gives rise to a density

enhancement in the laser's leading edge.

                                                

2 If one chooses to derive Eqs. 15 and 16 in the laboratory frame, the solution of the “impulse” equations of
motion must take into account a lengthened interaction time (a finite value evaluated in the d -function limit) as
the plasma elections obtain longitudinal velocity, by multiplying by the factor  1- v z

theory, and the nonlinear regime ( ˜ Q =2). For  kp
<<1, the simulations converge to the

linear theory, which is expected to be the case in this limit by Eqs. 16-20.

As the results of Eqs. 16-20 concern beams of negligible length, they are applicable, in

the limit  ˜ a ﬁ

0, to the case of a single particle. The effects of nonlinear plasma electron

response do not, as might have been hoped, remove the logarithmic divergence  noted in

Eq. 14. Note that the logarithmic term in Eq. 15 corresponds to the familiar Coulomb

logarithm[8], with an argument that is the ratio of the maximum  to minimum  impact

limit in the analysis is a.  The value of a in Eqs. 13-15 cannot be drawn towards zero

without violating several assumptions of our analysis, however. The fluid assumption is

fine; modeling the plasma electrons as a continuous fluid introduces  errors  not  in  the

average energy loss, but in the fluctuations of this quantity. For ultra-relativistic particles,

quantum  mechanical  effects  constrain 

the  minimum 

impact  parameter[9]

that both limits of the Coulomb logarithm in Eq. 22 can be viewed quantum mechanically,

as the minimum quantum of energy loss (emission of a plasmon) in the plasma is in fact

While the  -function beam limit is relevant to the point-charge case, it is not of highest

practical interest in bunched  beams,  as  it  has  often  been  argued  that  one  should  set

@ 1 to optimize drive beam energy loss in a PWFA[2-6,10,11]. In order to explore

the deviation in plasma response from the analytical  kp

<<1 result, we have performed

a series of simulations using a fully relativistic particle-in-cell code, MAGIC[16].  Taking
the beam of radius  ˜ a = 0.2, and Gaussian current profile with  kp
the charge from linear  to very nonlinear response,  ˜ Q = 0.02 to 200.

= 1.1, we have scanned

z

The results of this parametric scan, as well as the analytical results of linear theory,
are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that for the low amplitude cases  ˜ Q << 1 that the linear
theory predicts the average energy loss well. On the other hand, for  ˜ Q >> 1, the energy

loss is significantly smaller than that predicted by linear theory, by an order of magnitude
at  ˜ Q = 200.  Note also that the energy loss rate does not grow as  ˜ Q  is increased from 60

to 200. Similar results can be deduced from other published simulations[13]. From this

behavior, it can be seen that the relativistic saturation of  vr  and the snow-plow of the

density for finite length beams do not cancel. The relative roles of these two effects, as

well as that of changing plasma electron position during blow-out, can only be clarified by

detailed simulation analysis. For completeness we also plot the peak accelerating field

excited behind the driving beam. The peak in this field is localized  in a very narrow spike,

which is  a  small  region,  not  terribly  useful  for  acceleration[8].  This  spike  is  greatly

enhanced in the nonlinear case, thus partly explaining why field saturation was not noted

in previous simulation scans[4,8,12]. Even with this masking effect, the accelerating peak
still displays saturation when  ˜ Q >> 1.

     In conclusion, we restate the most surprising of our results, that the fully relativistic

response of a plasma to the passage of an ultra-short beam gives an induced electric field

that is identical to the linear result. We have in the process identified a single parameter,
the normalized charge  ˜ Q , which identifies when a bunched beam is expected to give rise to

nonlinear motion in  the  plasma.  Further,  this  parameter  may  be  used  to  predict  the

maximum physically achievable energy loss of a beam in plasma, Eq. 15. The interplay

between the nonlinear effects which cancel for infinitesimal,  but  not  for  finite,  length

beams must be studied in more detail by simulation. Such a study is now actively under

way.  Even  without  this  study,  however,  we  may  clearly  state  that  the  previously

proposed scaling of wakefield amplitudes as linear with  kp
z  and
kp a) is violated when the normalized charge  ˜ Q  exceeds unity. In fact, our simulations
indicate that when  ˜ Q  exceeds 100, that the coupling of the beam to the plasma does not

notably grow as the beam charge is increased.  It should be noted  in  this  regard  that

current proposals for PWFA experiments at Stanford using  highly  compressed  beams
imply beam-plasma systems with  ˜ Q >100 — the prospect for observing the deviation of

energy loss rate from linear scaling  is therefore high.

, along with combinatorial relations, allows the calculation of ratios of 

Me-neutrino = Mmu-neutrino = Mtau-neutrino = 0 (tree-level)
Me = 0.5110 MeV
Md = Mu = 312.8 MeV (constituent quark mass)
Mmu = 104.8 MeV
Ms = 625 MeV (constituent quark mass)
Mc = 2.09 GeV (constituent quark mass)
Mtau = 1.88 GeV
Mb = 5.63 GeV (constituent quark mass)
Mt = 130 GeV (constituent Truth Quark mass)

and

W+ mass = W- mass = 80.326 GeV
Z0 mass = 91.862 GeV
Higgs mass = 145.8 GeV
weak force - Higgs VEV = 252.5 GeV (assumed, since ratios are calculated)

as well as ratios of force strength constants:

Gravitational G = (Ggravity)(Mproton)^2 = 5 x 10^(-39) (assumed, since ratios are calculated)
electromagnetic fine structure constant = 1/137.03608
Gfermi = (Gweak)(Mproton)^2 = 1.02 x 10^(-5)
color force strength = 0.6286 (at 0.245 GeV) - perturbative QCD running gives

color force strength = 0.167 (at 5.3 GeV)
color force strength = 0.121 (at 34 GeV)
color force strength = 0.106 (at 91 GeV)

February 1984

About 10 years later, in April 1994, Fermilab officially announced observation of the Truth Quark.

Fermilab's analysis of the events gives a T-quark mass of about 170 GeV.

,
My independent analysis of the same Fermilab events gives a Truth Quark mass of about 130 GeV
consistent with the theoretical tree-level calculation.

The local Lagrangian of the theoretical model is based on the structure of the real Cl(1,7) Clifford algebra 
which, through 8-fold periodicity, might be used to construct a Generalized Hyperfinite II1 von Neumann 
Algebra factor.

In April 1994, CDF at Fermilab (in FERMILAB-PUB-94/097-E) reported a T-quark mass of 174 (+/-10)(+
13/-12) GeV. The data analyzed by CDF included a 26-event histogram for W + (3 or more) jets, without b-
tags, which is Figure 65 of the report, to which I have added blue and green colors to make discussion easier.

Some of the CDF histogram events, shown in blue, are in the 150-190 GeV range and do support the CDF 
analysis. However, there is a peak of 8 events in the 140-150 GeV bin, shown in green, that were excluded 
from the analysis by CDF, saying (on page 140 of the report) "... the bin with masses between 140 and 150 
GeV/c^2 has eight events.

We assume the mass combinations in the 140 to 150 GeV/c^2 bin represent a statistical fluctuation since their
width is narrower than expected for a top signal

. ...".

If the 140-150 GeV peak were only a statistical fluctuation seen by the CDF detector, one would not expect 
to find such a peak repeated in the data seen by the D0 detector at Fermilab. However, in March 1997, D0 (in 
hep-ex/9703008) reported a T-quark mass of 173.3 GeV (+/- 5.6 stat +/- 6.2 syst), based on data including a 
histogram similar to Figure 65 of the April 1994 CDF report which is Figure 3 of the D0 report, to which I 
have added blue and green colors to make discussion easier:

Some of the D0 histogram events, shown in blue, are are in the 150-190 GeV range and do support the CDF 
analysis. However, similar to the 140-150 GeV bin peak seen and thrown out by CDF,

there is a peak of 5 
, that were excluded from the analysis by D0. I did not see in 

Those 130-150 GeV peaks are from untagged semileptonic events.

Tagged semileptonic events may be a more reliable measure of T-quark mass, although there are fewer of 
them, so that statistics are not as good.

 

CDF (in hep-ex/9801014, dated 30 September 1997) reported a T-quark mass of 175.9 +/- 4.8(stat.) +/- 
4.9(syst.) GeV based on events that were either SVX tagged, SVX double tagged, or untagged. However,
CDF analysis of tagged semileptonic events (14 of them) gave a T-quark Mass of 142 GeV
 (+33, -14), as 
shown in their Figure 2, which is a plot of events/10 GeV bin vs. Reconstructed Mass in GeV:

Dilepton events may be the most reliable measure of T-quark mass, although they are the least numerous type 
of event, so that statistics are not so good.

 

In October 1998 (in hep-ex/9810029) CDF analyzed 8 dilepton events and reported a T-quark mass of 167.4 
+/- 10.3(stat) +/- 4.8(syst) GeV. Figure 2 of the report shows the 8 events:

I have colored green the events with T-quark mass less than 160 GeV, and blue the events with T-quark mass 
greater than 160 GeV. The hep-ex/9810029 CDF report stated that it "... supersedes our previously reported 
result in the dilepton channel ...".

 

The superseded previous CDF dilepton report (hep-ex/9802017) analyzed 9 events out of a total of 11 events, 
which 11 events are shown on the following histogram:

Note first, that in the earlier 11-event histogram 5 events are shown as greater than 150 GeV, but only 4 events 
are shown as greater than 160 GeV, while in the 8-event revised histogram 5 events are shown as greater than 
160 GeV. This indicates to me that some changes in the analysis have shifted the event mass assignments 
upward by about 10 GeV.

the earlier 11-event histogram contains 3 events from 120-140 GeV that are omitted from

D0 (in hep-ex/9706014 and hep-ex/9808029) has analyzed 6 dilepton events, reporting a T-quark mass of 
about 168.4 GeV. The 1997 UC Berkeley PhD thesis of Erich Ward Varnes which can be found on the web at 
http://wwwd0.fnal.gov/publications_talks/thesis/thesis.html contains details of the events and the D0 analyses. 
Each of the 6 events has its own characteristics. In this letter I will only discuss one of them, Run 84676 Event 
12814, an electron-muon dilepton event. This figure

from page 159 of the Varnes thesis, shows a T-quark mass likelihood plot calculated by the neutrino weighting 
algorithm.

In this event there were 3 jets instead of the 2 jets you would normally expect in a Dilepton event.

The solid line is the plot if all 3 jets are included, and the dashed line is the plot if only 2 of the jets are included 
by excluding the third (lowest transverse energy) jet.

The 3-jet interpretation supports the 170 GeV mass favored by the Fermilab consensus, while

the 2-jet interpretation supports a 130-140 GeV mass analysis that favors my calculated mass of 
about 130 Gev. 

Cl(1,7) Clifford Algebra, 8-Periodicity, and a Real Hyperfinite von Neumann Algebra

Cl(2;C) = M2(C) = 2x2 complex matrices

spinor representation = 1x2 complex column spinors

Hyperfinite II1 von Neumann Algebra factor is the completion of the union of all the 
tensor products

Cl(2;C) x ...(N times tensor product)... x Cl(2;C)

By looking at the spinor representation, you see that "the hyperfinite II1 factor is the 
smallest von Neumann algebra containing the creation and annihilation operators on a 
fermionic Fock space of countably infinite dimension."

In other words, Complex Clifford Periodicity leads to the complex hyperfinite II1 factor 
which represents Dirac's electron-positron fermionic Fock space.

Now, generalize this to get a representation of ALL the particles and fields of physics.

Use Real Clifford Periodicity to construct a Real Hyperfinite II1 factor as the completion 
of the union of all the tensor products

Cl(1,7;R) x ...(N times tensor product)... x Cl(1,7;R)

where the Real Clifford Periodicity is

Cl(N,7N;R) = Cl(1,7;R) x ...(N times tensor product)... x Cl(1,7;R)

The components of the Real Hyperfinite II1 factor are each

What are the physical interpretations of its representations?

There are two mirror image half-spinors, each of the form of a real (1,7) column vector 
with octonionic structure.

 

The 1 represents:

The 7 represent:

the neutrino.

the electron;

the red, blue, and green up quarks;

the red, blue, and green down quarks.

One half-spinor represents first-geneneration fermion particles, and its mirror image 
represents first-generation fermion antiparticles.

Second and third generation fermions come from dimensional reduction of spacetime, so 
that

first generation - octonions
second generation - pairs of octonions
third generation - triples of octonions

There is a (1,7)-dimensional vector representation that corresponds to an 8-dimensional 
high-energy spacetime with octonionic structure

that reduces at lower energies to quaternionic structures that are

a (1,3)-dimensional physical spacetime
a (0,4)-dimensional internal symmetry space

[my convention is (1,3)=(-+++)]

 

 

There is a 28-dimensonal bivector representation that corresponds to the gauge symmetry 
Lie algebra Spin(1,7)

that reduces at lower energies to:

a 16-dimensional U(2,2) = U(1)xSU(2,2) = U(1)xSpin(2,4) whose conformal Lie 
algebra / Lie group structure leads to gravity by a mechanism similar to the 
MacDowell-Mansouri mechanism;
a 12-dimensional SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) Standard Model symmetry group that is 
represented on the internal symmetry space by the structure SU(3) / SU(2)xU(1) =
CP2.

There is a 1-dimensional scalar representation for the Higgs mechanism.

reduction, as

D is the 8-dim Dirac operator

GF is the gauge-fixing term

GG is the ghost term

As shown in chapter 4 of 

Gockeler and Schucker
,

the scalar part of the Lagrangian dd P' /\ * dd P becomes Fh8 /\ *Fh8

where Fh8 is an 8-dimensional Higgs curvature term.

After dimensional reduction to 4-dim SpaceTime, the scalar Fh8 /\ *Fh8 term becomes the Integral over 4-dim 
Spacetime of

(Fh44 + Fh4I + FhII) /\ *(Fh44 + Fh4I + FhII) =

= Fh44 /\ *Fh44 + Fh4I /\ *Fh4I + FhII /\ *FhII

where cross-terms are eliminated by antisymmetry 

of the wedge /\ product 

and 4 denotes 4-dim SpaceTime

and I denotes 4-dim Internal Symmetry Space

The Internal Symmetry Space terms should be integrated over the 4-dimensional Internal Symmetry Space, to 
get 3 terms.

The first term

 is the integral over 4-dim SpaceTime of

Fh44 /\ *Fh44

Since they are both SU(2) gauge group terms, this term merges into the SU(2) weak force term that is the 
integral over 4-dim SpaceTime of Fw /\ *Fw (where w denotes Weak Force).

The third term

FhII(X,Y) /\ *FhII(X,Y) = (1/4) ( [ P(X) , P(Y) ]^2 - P([X,Y])^2 )

If integration of P over the Internal Symmetry Space gives P = (P+, P0), where P+ and P0 are the two

fundamental mass parameter that is to be set to define all other masses by the mass ratio formulas of the model.

v is set to be 252.514 GeV

so that it is equal to the sum of the physical masses of the weak bosons, W+, W-, and Z0, whose tree-level 
masses will be 80.326 GeV, 80.326 GeV, and 91.862 GeV, respectively, and

so that the electron mass will be 0.5110 MeV.

Then, the tree-level mass Mh of the Higgs scalar particle is given by

Mh = v / sqrt(3) = 145.789 GeV

and a real Higgs field H.

The Complex Doublet P = ( P+, P0) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( P1 + iP2, P3 + iP4 ) = (1/sqrt(2)) ( 0, v + H ), so that

P3 = (1/sqrt(2)) ( v + H )

where v is the vacuum expectation value and H is the real surviving Higgs field.

The value of the fundamental mass scale vacuum expectation value v of the Higgs scalar field is in the 
theoretical model set to be 252.514 GeV so that the electron mass will turn out to be 0.5110 MeV.

Now, to interpret the term

(1/4) ( [ P(X) , P(Y) ]^2 - P([X,Y])^2 ) = (1/4) ( L (PP)^2 - M^2 PP )

in terms of v and H, note that L = M^2 / v^2 and that P = (1/sqrt(2)) ( v + H ), so that

FhII(X,Y) /\ *FhII(X,Y) = (1/4) ( L (PP)^2 - M^2 PP ) =

= (1/16) ((M^2 / v^2) ( v + H )^4 - (1/8) M^2 ( v + H )^2 =

= (1/4) M^2 H^2 - (1/16) M^2 v^2 ( 1 - 4 H^3 / v^3 - H^4 / v^4 )

Integration over Internal Symmetry Space of (1/2) dx P(Y) gives (1/2) dx P, where now P denotes the scalar 
Higgs field and dx denotes covariant derivative in the X direction.

Taking into account the Complex Doublet structure of P, the second term is the Integral over 4-dim SpaceTime 
of

 

Fh4I /\ *Fh4I = (1/2) d P /\ *(1/2) d P = (1/4) d P /\ *d P =

= (1/4) (1/2) d ( v + H ) /\ *d ( v + H ) = (1/8) dH dH + (some terms in v and H)

Disregarding some terms in v and H,

Fh4I /\ *Fh4I = (1/8) dH dH

Combining the second and third terms, since the first term is merged into the weak force part of the Lagrangian:

Fh4I /\ *Fh4I + FhII(X,Y) /\ *FhII(X,Y) =

= (1/8) dH dH + (1/4) M^2 H^2 - (1/16) M^2 v^2 =

= (1/8) ( dH dH + 2 M^2 H^2 - (1/2) M^2 v^2 )

This is the form of the Higgs Lagrangian in 

Barger and Phillips

 for a Higgs scalar particle of mass

Mh = M sqrt(2) = v / sqrt(3)= 145.789 GeV

massless high-energy.
 
In this physics model, force strength probabilities are calculated
in terms of relative volumes of bounded complex homogeneous domains and
their Shilov boundaries.
 
The bounded complex homogeneous domains correspond to
harmonic functions of generalized Laplacians
that determine heat equations, or diffusion equations;
 
while the amplitude to emit gauge bosons in the
HyperDiamond Feynman Checkerboard is a process that
is similar to diffusion, and
therefore also corresponds to a generalized Laplacian.
 
 
In this theoretical  model, all force strengths are 
represented as ratios with respect to the geometric force 
strength of Gravity (that is, the force strength of Gravity 
without using the Effective Mass factor).

The charge of the Spin(5) gravitons is taken to be unity, 1,
so that its force strength is also unity, 1.
All other force strengths are determined as ratios
with respect to the Spin(5) gravitons and each other.
 
The force strength probability for a gauge boson to
be emitted from an origin spacetime HyperDiamond vertex
and go to a target vertex is the product of three things:
 
the volume Vol(MISforce) of the target Internal Symmetry Space,
that is, the part of the Internal Symmetry Space
of the target spacetime vertex that is available for the gauge boson
to go to from the origin vertex;
 
the volume Vol(Qforce) / Vol(Dforce)^( 1 / mforce ) 
of the spacetime link to the target spacetime vertex 
from the origin vertex; and
 
an effective mass factor 1 / Mforce^2 for forces
(such as the Weak force and Gravity)
that, in the low-energy ranges of our experiments,
are carried effectively by gauge bosons that are not
massless high-energy SU(2) or Spin(5) gauge bosons,
but are either massive Weak bosons due to the Higgs mechanism
or effective spin-2 gravitons. For other forces, the
effective mass factor is taken to be unity, 1.
 
Therefore, the force strength of a given force is

To calculate Weak Boson Masses and Weinberg Angle:

Denote the 3 SU(2) high-energy weak bosons 
(massless at energies higher than the electroweak unification) 
by W+, W-, and W0, corresponding to the massive 
physical weak bosons W+, W-, and Z0. 

The triplet  { W+, W-, W0 } 
couples directly with the T - Tbar quark-antiquark pair, 
so that the total mass of the triplet  { W+, W-, W0 } 
at the electroweak unification 
is equal to the total mass of a T - Tbar pair, 259.031 GeV.
 
The triplet  { W+, W-, Z0 } 
couples directly with the Higgs scalar, 
which carries the Higgs mechanism by 
which the W0 becomes the physical Z0, 
so that the total mass of the triplet  { W+, W-, Z0 } 
is equal to the vacuum expectation value v of
the Higgs scalar field, v = 252.514 GeV.
 
What are individual masses of members
of the triplet { W+, W-, Z0 } ?
 
First, look at the triplet  { W+, W-, W0 } 
which can be represented by the 3-sphere S^3.
 
The Hopf fibration of S^3 as
S^1 --} S^3 --} S^2
gives a decomposition of the W bosons
into the neutral W0 corresponding to S^1 and
the charged pair W+ and W- corresponding
to S^2.
 
 
The mass ratio of the sum of the masses of
W+ and W- to
the mass of W0
should be the volume ratio of
the S^2 in S^3 to

the S^1 in S3.
 
 
The unit sphere S^3 in R^4 is
normalized by 1 / 2.
 
 
The unit sphere S^2 in R^3 is
normalized by 1 / sqrt3.
 
 
The unit sphere S^1 in R^2 is
normalized by 1 / sqrt2.
 
 
The ratio of the sum of the W+ and W- masses to
the W0 mass should then be
(2 / sqrt3) V(S^2) / (2 / sqrt2) V(S^1) = 1.632993.
 
Since the total mass of the triplet  { W+, W-, W0 } 
is 259.031 GeV, the total mass of a T - Tbar pair, 
and the charged weak bosons have equal mass, 
we have
 

mW+ = mW- = 80.326 GeV, 

 
and mW0 = 98.379  GeV.
 

Parity Violation, Effective Masses, and Weinberg Angle:

The charged W+/- neutrino-electron interchange
 
must be symmetric with the electron-neutrino interchange,
 
so that the absence of right-handed neutrino particles requires
 
that the charged W+/- SU(2)
weak bosons act only on left-handed electrons.
 
Each gauge boson must act consistently
on the entire Dirac fermion particle sector,
so that the charged W+/- SU(2) weak bosons
act only on left-handed fermions of all types.
 
The neutral W0 weak boson does not interchange Weyl
neutrinos with Dirac fermions, and so is not restricted
to left-handed fermions,
but also has a component that acts on both types of fermions,
both left-handed and right-handed, conserving parity.

13/7/02 7:21 AM

However, the neutral W0 weak bosons are related to
the charged W+/- weak bosons by custodial SU(2)
symmetry, so that the left-handed component of the
neutral W0 must be equal to the left-handed (entire)
component of the charged W+/-.
 
Since the mass of the W0 is greater than the mass
of the W+/-, there remains for the W0 a component
acting on both types of fermions.
 
Therefore the full W0 neutral weak boson interaction
is proportional to
(mW+/-^2 / mW0^2) acting on left-handed fermions
and
 
(1 - (mW+/-^2 / mW0^2)) acting
on both types of fermions.
 
If (1 - (mW+/-2 / mW0^2)) is defined to be
sin(thetaw)^2 and denoted by K, and
 
if the strength of the W+/- charged weak force
(and of the custodial SU(2) symmetry) is denoted by T,
 
then the W0 neutral weak interaction can be written as:
 
W0L = T + K and W0LR = K.
 
 
Since the W0 acts as W0L with respect to the
parity violating SU(2) weak force and
 
as W0LR with respect to the parity conserving U(1)
electromagnetic force of the U(1) subgroup of SU(2),
 
the W0 mass mW0 has two components:
 
the parity violating SU(2) part mW0L that is
equal to mW+/- ; and
 
the parity conserving part mW0LR that acts like a
heavy photon.
 
As mW0 = 98.379 GeV = mW0L + mW0LR, and
 
as mW0L = mW+/- = 80.326  GeV,
 
we have mW0LR = 18.053  GeV.
 
 
 
Denote by *alphaE = *e^2 the force
strength of the weak parity conserving U(1)
electromagnetic type force that acts through the
U(1) subgroup of SU(2).

The electromagnetic force strength
alphaE = e^2 = 1 / 137.03608 was calculated
in Chapter 8 using
the volume V(S^1) of an S^1 in R^2,
normalized by 1 / \qrt2.
 
 
The *alphaE force is part of the SU(2) weak
force whose strength alphaW = w^2 was calculated
in Chapter 8 using the volume V(S^2) of an S^2 \subset R^3,
normalized by 1 / sqrt3.
 
 
Also, the electromagnetic force strength alphaE = e^2
was calculated in Chapter 8 using a
4-dimensional spacetime with global structure of
the 4-torus T^4 made up of four S^1 1-spheres,
 
 
while the SU(2) weak force strength
alphaW = w^2 was calculated in Chapter 8
using two 2-spheres S^2 x S^2,
each of which contains one 1-sphere of
the *alphaE force.
 
 
Therefore
*alphaE = alphaE ( sqrt2 / sqrt3)(2 / 4) = alphaE / sqrt6,
 
*e = e / (4th root of 6) = e / 1.565 , and
 
 
the mass mW0LR must be reduced to an effective value
 
 
mW0LReff = mW0LR / 1.565 = 18.053/1.565 = 11.536 GeV
 
 
for the *alphaE force to act like
an electromagnetic force in the 4-dimensional
spacetime HyperDiamond Feynman Checkerboard model:
 
 
*e mW0LR = e (1/5.65) mW0LR = e mZ0,
 
 
where the physical effective neutral weak boson is
denoted by Z0.
 
 
Therefore, the correct HyperDiamond Feynman Checkerboard values for
weak boson masses and the Weinberg angle thetaW are:

mW+ = mW- = 80.326 GeV;

mZ0 = 

80.326 + 11.536

 = 91.862 GeV;

Radiative corrections are not taken into account here,
and may change these tree-level values somewhat.
 

To calculate Fermion Masses: 

Constituent Quark Masses:  

To do calculations in theories such as 
Perturbative QCD and Chiral Perturbation Theory, 
you need to use effective quark masses that 
are called current masses.  Current quark masses are different 
from the Pre-Quantum constituent quark masses of our model. 
The current mass of a quark is defined in this model as 
the difference between 
the constituent mass of the quark 
and 
the density of the lowest-energy sea of virtual gluons, 
quarks, and antiquarks, or 312.75 MeV. 
 

The fundamental correctness of the Constituent Quark Mass and the effectiveness of the NonRelativistic Quark 
Model of hadrons can be explained by Bohm's quantum theory applied to a fermion confined in a box, in which 
the fermion is at rest because its kinetic energy is transformed into PSI-field potential energy. Since that aspect 
of Bohm's quantum theory is not a property of most other formulations of quantum theory, the effectiveness of 
.
the NonRelativistic Quark Model confirms Bohm's quantum theory as opposed to those others

are represented by pairs of octonions.
 
Third generation fermion particles and antiparticles
are represented by triples of octonions.
 
There are no higher generations of fermions than the Third.
 
This can be seen  geometrically as a consequence of the fact 
that
if you reduce the original 8-dimensional spacetime
into associative 4-dimensional physical spacetime
and coassociative 4-dimensional Internal Symmetry Space 
then 
if you look in the original 8-dimensional spacetime
at a fermion (First-generation represented by a single octonion)
propagating from one vertex to another 
there are only 4 possibilities for the same propagation
after dimensional reduction:
 

1 - the origin o and target x vertices are both

   in which case the propagation is unchanged, and the

the volume of a compact manifold representing the
spinor fermions S8+ is used.
It is the parallelizable manifold S^7 x RP^1.
 
 
Also, since gravitation is coupled to mass,
the infinitesimal generators of the MacDowell-Mansouri
gravitation group, Spin(0,5), are relevant.
 
 
The calculated quark masses are constituent masses, 
not current masses.
 

Fermion masses are calculated as a product of four factors:

 

 

V(Qfermion) x N(Graviton) x N(octonion) x Sym

V(Qfermion) is the volume of the part of 
the half-spinor fermion particle manifold S^7 x RP^1 
that is related to the fermion particle 
by photon, weak boson, and gluon interactions.
 
 
N(Graviton) is the number of types of Spin(0,5) graviton

related to the fermion. 
The 10 gravitons correspond to 
the 10 infinitesimal generators of Spin(0,5) = Sp(2).
 
2 of them are in the Cartan subalgebra.
 
6 of them carry color charge, 
and may therefore be considered as corresponding to quarks.
 
The remaining 2 carry no color charge, 
but may carry electric charge 
and so may be considered as corresponding to electrons.
 
One graviton takes the electron into itself, 
and the other can only take the first-generation electron 
into the massless electron neutrino.
 
Therefore only one graviton should correspond to the mass
of the first-generation electron.
 
The graviton number ratio of the down quark to the
first-generation electron is therefore 6/1 = 6.
 
 
N(octonion) is an octonion number factor relating up-type quark
masses to down-type quark masses in each generation.
 
 
Sym is an internal symmetry factor, relating 2nd and 3rd
generation massive leptons to first generation fermions.
It is not used in first-generation calculations.

The ratio of the down quark constituent mass to the electron mass
is then calculated as follows:
 
Consider the electron, e.
 
By photon, weak boson, and gluon interactions,
e can only be taken into 1, the massless neutrino.
 
The electron and neutrino, or their antiparticles,
cannot be combined to produce any of the
massive up or down quarks.
 
The neutrino, being massless at tree level,
does not add anything to the mass formula for the electron.
 
Since the electron cannot be related to any other massive Dirac
fermion, its volume V(Qelectron) is taken to be 1.
 
 
Next consider a red down quark I.
 
By gluon interactions, 
I can be taken into J and K,
the blue and green down quarks.

By also using weak boson interactions, 
it can be taken into i, j, and k, 
the red, blue, and green up quarks.
 
Given the up and down quarks, 
pions can be formed from quark-antiquark pairs, 
and the pions can decay 
to produce electrons and neutrinos.
 
Therefore the red down quark (similarly, any down quark)
is related to any part of S^7 x RP^1,
the compact manifold corresponding to
 
{ 1, i, j, k, I, J, K, E }
 
and therefore a down quark should have a spinor manifold
volume factor V(Qdown quark) of the volume of
S^7 x RP^1.
 
The ratio of the down quark spinor manifold volume factor to
the electron spinor manifold volume factor is just
 
V(Qdown quark) / V(Qelectron) = V(S^7x  RP^1)/1 = pi^5 / 3.
 
 
Since the first generation graviton factor is 6,
 

md/me = 6V(S^7 x RP^1) = 2 pi^5 = 612.03937

As the up quarks correspond to i, j, and k,
which are 
the octonion transforms under E of I, J, and K 
of the down quarks, 
the up quarks and down quarks
have the same constituent mass mu = md.
 
 
Antiparticles have the same mass as the corresponding
particles.
 
 
Since the model only gives ratios of massses,
the mass scale is fixed so that the electron mass 

Then, the constituent mass of the down quark is

me = 0.5110 MeV.

md = 312.75 MeV, and

the constituent mass for the up quark is

As the 
masses of its constituent quarks
 

 mass is taken to be the sum of the constituent

mproton = mu + mu + md = 938.25 MeV

The theoretical calculation is close to
the experimental value of 938.27 MeV.
 
 

The third generation fermion particles correspond to triples of
octonions. There are 8^3 = 512 such triples.
 
 
The triple { 1,1,1 } corresponds to the tau-neutrino.
 
 
The other 7 triples involving only 1 and E correspond
to the tauon:
{ E, E, E }
{ E, E, 1 }
{ E, 1, E }
{ 1, E, E }
{ 1, 1, E }
{ 1, E, 1 }
{ E, 1, 1 }
 
The symmetry of the 7 tauon triples is the same 
as the symmetry of 
the 3 down quarks, the 3 up quarks, and the electron,
so the tauon mass should be 
the same as 
the sum of the masses of 
the first generation massive fermion particles.
 
 

Therefore the tauon mass is 1.877 GeV.

The calculated Tauon mass of 1.88 GeV is a sum 
of first generation fermion masses, all of which are 
valid at the energy level of about 1 GeV
 
However, as the Tauon mass is about 2 GeV, 
the effective Tauon mass should be renormalized 
from the energy level of 1 GeV (where the mass is 1.88 GeV)

Such a renormalization should reduce the mass. 
If the renormalization reduction were about 5 percent,

Note that all triples corresponding to the

The beauty quark corresponds to 21 triples.
 
They are triples of the same form as the 7 tauon triples,
but for 1 and I, 1 and J, and 1 and K,
which correspond to the red, green, and blue beauty quarks,
respectively.
 
 
The seven triples of the red beauty quark correspond
to the seven triples of the tauon,
except that the beauty quark interacts with 6 Spin(0,5)
gravitons while the tauon interacts with only two.
 
 
The beauty quark constituent mass should be the tauon mass times the

The calculated Beauty Quark mass of 5.63 GeV is a 
consitituent mass, that is, 
it corresponds to the conventional pole mass plus 312.8 MeV. 
 
Therefore, the calculated Beauty Quark mass of 5.63 GeV

The pole mass can be converted to an MSbar mass 
if the color force strength constant alpha_s is known. 
The conventional value of alpha_s at about 5 GeV is about 0.22. 
Using alpha_s (5 GeV) = 0.22, 
a pole mass of 5.0 GeV gives an MSbar 1-loop mass of 4.6 GeV, 
and an MSbar 1,2-loop mass of 4.3, evaluated at about 5 GeV. 
 
If the MSbar mass is run from 5 GeV up to 90 GeV, 
the MSbar mass decreases by about 1.3 GeV, 
giving an expected MSbar mass of about 3.0 GeV at 90 GeV.

The second generation fermion particles correspond
to pairs of octonions.
 
There are 8^2 = 64 such pairs.
 
The pair { 1,1 } corresponds to the mu-neutrino.
 
the pairs { 1, E }, { E, 1 }, and

Compare the symmetries of the muon pairs to the symmetries
of the first generation fermion particles.
 
The pair { E, E } should correspond
to the E electron.
 
The other two muon pairs have a symmetry group S2,
which is 1/3 the size of the color symmetry group S3
which gives the up and down quarks their mass of 312.75 MeV.
 
 
Therefore the mass of the muon should be the sum of
the { E, E } electron mass and

The red strange quark is defined as the thrge pairs
1 and I, because I is the red down quark.
 
Its mass should be the sum of two parts:
the { I, I } red down quark mass, 312.75 MeV, and
the product of the symmetry part of the muon mass, 104.25 MeV,
times the graviton factor.
 
 
Unlike the first generation situation,
massive second and third generation leptons can be taken,
by both of the colorless gravitons that
may carry electric charge, into massive particles.
 
 
Therefore the graviton factor for the second and
 
third generations is 6/2 = 3.
 
 
Therefore the symmetry part of the muon mass times
the graviton factor 3 is 312.75 MeV, 
and
the red strange quark constituent mass 
is

ms = 312.75 MeV + 312.75 MeV = 625.5 MeV

The blue strange quarks correspond to the
three pairs involving J,
the green strange quarks correspond to the
three pairs involving K,
and their masses are determined similarly.
 
 
The charm quark corresponds to the other 51 pairs.
Therefore, the mass of the red charm quark should
be the sum of two parts:

the product of the symmetry part of the strange quark
mass, 312.75 MeV, and

Proton-Neutron Mass Difference: 

According to the 1986 CODATA Bulletin No. 63, 
the experimental value of the neutron mass is 939.56563(28) Mev, 
and the experimental value of the proton is 938.27231(28) Mev. 
 
The neutron-proton mass difference 1.3 Mev is due to 
the fact that the proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark, 
while the neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks.
 

The magnitude of the electromagnetic energy difference 

mN - mP is about 1 Mev, 
but the sign is wrong:  mN - mP = -1 Mev, 

and 

the proton's electromagnetic mass is greater than the neutron's. 
 
The difference in energy between the bound states, neutron and proton, 
is not due to a difference between 
the Pre-Quantum constituent masses of the up quark and the down quark, 
calculated in the theory to be equal. 
 
It is due to the difference between the Quantum color force 
interactions of the up and down constituent valence quarks 
with the gluons and virtual sea quarks in the neutron and the proton. 
 
An up valence quark, constituent mass 313 Mev, 
does not often swap places with a 2.09 Gev charm sea quark, 
but a 313 Mev down valence quark can more often swap places

with a 625 Mev strange sea quark. 
 
Therefore the Quantum color force constituent mass 
of the down valence quark is heavier by about 
 
(ms - md)  (md/ms)^2   a(w)  |Vds|  =
 
=   312  x  0.25   x  0.253  x  0.22   Mev   =   4.3 Mev, 
 
(where 
a(w) = 0.253 is the geometric part of the weak force strength 
and 
|Vds| = 0.22 is the magnitude of the K-M parameter 
        mixing first generation down and second generation strange)
 
so that 
of the down quark is 
                      Qmd = 312.75 + 4.3 = 317.05 MeV. 

the Quantum color force constituent mass Qmd 

 
Similarly, 
the up quark Quantum color force mass increase is about 
 
(mc - mu)  (mu/mc)^2  a(w)  |V(uc)|  =
 
=  1777  x  0.022  x  0.253  x  0.22   Mev   =   2.2 Mev, 
 
(where 
|Vuc| = 0.22 is the magnitude of the K-M parameter 
        mixing first generation up and second generation charm) 
 
so that 
of the up quark is 
                      Qmu = 312.75 + 2.2 = 314.95 MeV.
 

the Quantum color force constituent mass Qmu 

The Quantum color force Neutron-Proton mass difference is 

 
mN - mP = Qmd - Qmu  =  317.05 Mev - 314.95 Mev = 2.1 Mev.
 
 
Since the electromagnetic Neutron-Proton mass difference is 
 
roughly mN - mP = -1 MeV
 
the total theoretical Neutron-Proton mass difference is 

 

 

mN - mP = 2.1 Mev - 1 Mev = 1.1 Mev,

an estimate that is fairly close 
to the experimental value of 1.3 Mev. 
 
 
Note that in the equation 
 
(ms - md)  (md/ms)^2   a(w)  |Vds|  =   4.3 Mev

Vds is a mixing of down and strange by a neutral Z0, 
compared to the more conventional Vus mixing by charged W. 
Although real neutral Z0 processes are suppressed 
by the GIM mechanism, 
which is a cancellation of virtual processes, 
the process of the equation is strictly a virtual process. 
Note also that the K-M mixing parameter |Vds| is linear. 
Mixing (such as between a down quark and a strange quark) 
is a two-step process, 
that goes approximately as the square of |Vds|: 
First 
the down quark changes to a virtual strange quark, 
producing one factor of |Vds|. 
Then, second,
the virtual strange quark changes back to a down quark, 
producing a second factor of |Vsd|, which is approximately 
equal to |Vds|. 
 
Only the first step (one factor of |Vds|) appears in the 
Quantum mass formula used to determine the neutron mass. 
If you measure the mass of a neutron,
that measurement includes a sum over a lot of histories
of the valence quarks inside the neutron.
In some of those histories, in my view,
you will "see" some of the two valence down quarks
in a virtual transition state that is at a time
after the first action, or change from down to strange,
and
before the second action, or change back.
Therefore, you should take into account
those histories in the sum in which you see a strange valence quark,
and you get the linear factor |Vds| in the above equation. 
 
 
Note also that 
if there were no second generation fermions, 
or 
if the second generation quarks had equal masses, 
then 
the proton would be heavier than the neutron 
(due to the electromagnetic difference) 
and 
the hydrogen atom would decay into a neutron, 
and 
there would be no stable atoms in our world.

UCC - DCC Baryon Mass Difference:

a 14 June 20002 article by Kurt Riesselmann in Fermi News

According to 
generation ] flavors - up, down, strange, charm - allow for twenty different ways of putting quarks together to 
form baryons ... Protons, for example, consist of two up quarks and one down quark (u-u-d), and neutrons 
have a u-d-d quark content. Some combinations exist in two different spin configurations, and the SELEX 
collaboration believes it has identified both spin levels of the u-c-c baryon. ... Physicists expect the mass 
difference between u-c-c and d-c-c baryons to be comparable to the difference in proton (u-u-d) and neutron 
(u-d-d) mass, since this particle pair is also related by the replacement of an up by a down quark. 
The proton-
neutron mass splitting
candidates

is sixty times smaller than the mass difference between the Xi_cc 

 observed by the SELEX collaboration. ...

: "... The four [ first and second 

, however, 

... Other questions, however, remain as well. The SELEX collaboration is puzzled by the high rate of doubly 
charmed baryons seen in their experiment. As a matter of fact, most scientists believed that the SELEX 
collaboration wouldn't see any of these particles. ...".

 

An up valence quark, constituent mass 313 Mev, 
can swap places with a 2.09 Gev charm sea quark. 
Therefore the Quantum color force constituent mass 
of the down valence quark is heavier by about 
 
  (mc - mu)    a(w)    |Vds|         =
 
=   1,777  x  0.253  x  0.22   Mev   =   98.9 Mev, 
(where 
a(w) = 0.253 is the geometric part of the weak force strength 
and 
|Vuc| = 0.22 is the magnitude of the K-M parameter 
        mixing first generation up and second generation charm)
 
so that the Quantum color force constituent mass Qmu 
of the up quark is 
                      Qmu = 312.75 + 98.9 = 411.65 MeV. 

A 313 Mev down valence quark can swap places 
with a 625 Mev strange sea quark. 
Therefore the Quantum color force constituent mass 
of the down valence quark is heavier by about 
 
  (ms - md)  a(w)    |Vds|         =
 
=   312  x  0.253  x  0.22   Mev   =   17.37 Mev, 

(where 
a(w) = 0.253 is the geometric part of the weak force strength 
and 
|Vds| = 0.22 is the magnitude of the K-M parameter 
        mixing first generation down and second generation strange)

so that the Quantum color force constituent mass Qmd 
of the down quark is 
                      Qmd = 312.75 + 17.37 = 330.12 MeV. 

Note that at the energy levels at which ucc and dcc live, the ambient sea of quark-antiquark pairs has at least 
enough energy to produce a charm quark, so that in the above equations there is no mass-ratio-squared 
suppression factor such as (mu/mc)^2 or (md/ms)^2, unlike the case of the calculation of 
mass difference
almost stable and the neutron-proton mass difference is, according to experiment, only about 1.3 MeV.

for which the ambient sea of quark-antiquark pairs has very little energy since the proton is

the neutron-proton 

Note also that these rough calculations ignore the electromagnetic force mass differentials, as they are only on 
the order of 1 MeV or so, which for ucc - dcc mass difference is small, unlike the case for the calculation of 
neutron-proton mass difference
.

the 

The Quantum color force ucc - dcc mass difference is 
 

mucc - mdcc = 

Qmu - Qmd = 411.65 MeV - 330.12 MeV

 = 81.53 MeV

Since the experimental value of the neutron-proton mass difference is about 1.3 MeV, the theoretically 
calculated

ucc - dcc mass difference is about

81.53 / 1.3 =

 62.7 times the experimental value of the 

neutron-proton mass difference,

which is consistent with the SELEX 2002 experimental result that:

"... The proton-neutron mass splitting ... is

sixty times smaller than the mass difference between the Xi_cc candidates ..."

The theoretical physics model described in this paper is not only based on the Lie Algebras D4, D5, E6, E7, 
and E8, but also on the 256-dimensional Clifford Algebra Cl(1,7), whose 256 dimensions correspond to 
the

Abstract 

      We  identify  a  new  shot  noise  suppression  mechanism  in  a  thin  (~100  nm)  heterostructure 

avalanche  photodiode.  In  the  low-gain  regime  the  shot  noise  is  suppressed  due  to  temporal 

correlations within amplified current pulses. We demonstrate in a Monte Carlo simulation that the 

effective  excess  noise  factors  can  be  <1,  and  reconcile  the  apparent  conflict  between  theory  and 

experiments. This shot noise suppression mechanism is independent of known mechanisms such as 

Coulomb interaction, or reflection at heterojunction interfaces.

Shot noise suppression in mesoscopic devices has drawn a lot of attention in recent years, as 

noise  contains  ample  information  of  physical  processes.    González  et  al.  found  a  universal  shot 

noise suppression factor of 1/3 in non-degenerate diffusive conductors, a result of elastic electron 

scattering [1]. Oberholzer et al. studied [2] the partitioning of the electron wave diffraction inside a 

chaotic cavity that results in a Fano factor of 1/4. Strong shot noise suppression has been observed 

in ballistic quantum point contacts, due to temporally correlated electrons, possibly a consequence 

of space-charge effect (Coulomb interactions) [3]. Shot noise is also suppressed when low-energy 

(<0.3  eV)  electrons  resonant-tunnel  through  two  barriers  made  of  AlxGa1-xAs,  with  a  GaAs 

quantum well between the barriers [4]. Other causes of shot noise suppression include Fermi-Dirac 

statistics  through  the  Pauli  principle  [5]  and  phase  coherent  transport  [6].  All  these  examples 

involve shot noise suppression because there is no gain mechanism involved. On the other hand in 

a resonant-tunneling diode, biased in the negative differential resistance regime, a tunneled electron 

raises the potential energy of a quantum well producing more available states for more tunneling. 

Such a positive correlation results in a shot noise enhancement [7].  

      Multiplication noise in avalanche photodiodes (APDs) has been studied extensively in the 

literature  [8-13],  and  a  common  figure  of  merit  is  the  so  called  excess  noise  factor, 

F(<M>)=<M2>/<M>2,  as  a  function  of  the  mean  gain  <M>.  By  this  definition  F(<M>)≥1. 

However, recently Wang et al. [14] have measured excess noise factors < 1 (Fig. 1) at low gains for 

an Impact-Ionization-Engineered (I2E) APD. The multiplication region of this APD consists of an 

80 nm-thick Al0.2Ga0.8As layer sandwiched between two thin (~20 nm) layers of Al0.6Ga0.4As. 

The p and n layers on opposite sides of the multiplication region are heavily doped, resulting in a 

rather  flat  electric  field  profile  across  the  multiplication  region.  The  motivation  for  the  I2E  APD 

structure is to use heterostructures to help carriers impact ionize at preferred locations, resulting in

lower  excess  noise.  As  shown  in  Ref.  [14],  photoelectrons  diffuse  through  the  p-region  and  are 

accelerated in the Al0.6Ga0.4As layer in the multiplication region. Owing to the higher ionization 

threshold of Al0.6Ga0.4As, very few ionization events occur while the electrons gain energy. Once 

these electrons enter the Al0.2Ga0.8As layer, they impact ionize in a more concordant manner. The 

spatial localization of the ionization events is the key to the more deterministic ionization behavior 

and  the  reduced  excess  noise  in  such  an  APD.  Although  these  arguments  explain  the  overall 

behavior of reduced noise, the measured <1 value of the excess noise factor is inconsistent with the 

definition of F(<M>).  

the assumption 

            In order to understand the origin of the apparent conflict between theory and experiments, 

we  need  to  re-examine  the  definition  of  the  excess  noise  factor.  In  experiments,  noise  power, 

photocurrent and gain are measured. The excess noise factor can only be indirectly calculated using 

 

 

     
 
where SI(0) is the noise power at 0 Hz, and I0 is the unity-gain photocurrent.  In the following we 

 F(<M>) = SI(0)/(2e <M>2 I0),                                                       (1) 

review the origin of Eq. (1), following closely the derivations of van der Ziel [17].   

     

The  current  power  can  be  obtained  using  the  Wiener-Khinchin  theorem  [17]  by  Fourier-

transforming the current autocorrelation function, i.e., SI(f)=2F(<I(t)I(t +τ)>). The DC component 

of I(t), after autocorrelation and Fourier transform, becomes the signal power, <I>2δ(f). We shall 

focus on the AC component, or the noise part of SI(f).  

      

It can be proved that at f~0 Hz [17], 

                    

 

Sn(0)=2 var n=2 (<n2> - <n>2).                                                    (2) 

If n(t) is a Poisson process, var n=<n>. The electrical current I(t)=en(t), where e is the charge and 

n(t) is the series of electron arrival events; therefore we have

 SI(0)=e2Sn(0)=2 e2var n = 2e2<n>=2e<I>,                                  (3) 

which is the well-known Schottky theorem for shot noise.   

       When multiplications are present, assuming n electrons are initially photo-generated, each 

having  a  multiplication  of  Mi, 

the 

total  number  of  collected  electrons 

is  N=∑

iM

Under the assumptions <Mi>=<M> and <Mi

2>=<M2>, i.e, the multiplication and its variance are 

independent of the label “i” of the “i”th photoelectron, we have Burgess variance theorem [17]:  

<N>=<n><M>, var N=<M>2 var n + <n> var M,                    (4) 

    

      

 

 

consequently  

 

 

 SI(0)=2 e2 var N = 2 e2 [<M>2 var n + <n> var M].                   (5) 

If the photo-generated electrons are independent of each other, i.e., a Poisson distribution, we have 

var n = <n>. Using the definition of var M,  

       

 

SI(0)= 2 e2 [< M>2 <n> + <n>(<M2>-<M>2 )]= 2 e2 <n><M2> 

             

       =2e <M2>/ <M>2    <M>2 I0  = 2e F(<M>) <M>2 I0 . 

                    (6) 

      

The  validity  of  Eq.  (6)  depends  critically  on  the  assumptions  for  the  Burgess  theorem, 

which  holds  true  only  when  the  individual,  multiplied  current  pulses  resulting  from  each 

photoelectron have negligible width, i.e., “instantaneous amplification” [18]. The assumptions for 

Burgess theorem imply that each electron is associated with a certain photon (i). However, in the 

measurements  of  current  and  noise,  photo-generated  electrons  and  multiplication-generated 

electrons  are  indistinguishable  when  the  current  pulses  overlap.  When  evaluating  noise,  the 

correlations  among  all  the  electrons  should  be  considered,  as  we  will  do  in  the  Monte  Carlo 

simulations of the present work. The sum of all the electrons N=∑

iM

should be over “time slices” 

n

instead  over  the  label  “i”.  Within  a  time  slice  the  electrons  could  be  the  offspring  of  different

photoelectrons.  Burgess variance theorem in fact imposes a discrimination against the correlations 

within individual current pulses.  

     

Recently  developed  “dead  space”  models  explain  lower  noise  in  thinner  APDs  due  to  the 

change  of  the  gain  distribution  [9,  10,  12,  13].  In  these  models,  electrons  need  to  travel  a  finite 

distance  before  gaining  enough  energy  to  impact  ionize,  hence  the  avalanche  process  is  more 

deterministic than otherwise. The same results can be obtained in Monte Carlo simulations of gain 

distributions of individual electrons in a thin and a thick APD (Fig. 2). The dead-space models, and 

previous  Monte  Carlo  models  that  evaluate  F(<M>)  by  counting  the  carriers,  both  neglect  the 

importance of temporally finite-width pulses that are within themselves correlated, and such intra-

pulse  correlations  contribute  to  the  noise  power  as  do  the  inter-pulse  correlations.  Hence,  these 

models still assume Eqs. (4) to (6) to be true and predict the excess noise factor to be always ≥1. To 

clearly  see  this  point,  we  consider  a  simple  case  where  the  ratio  of  hole-to-electron  ionization 

coefficients  k=β/α=0.  Traditional  APD  theory  predicts  F(<M>)(cid:198)  2  when  <M>(cid:198)  ∞,  based  on  

McIntyre’s formulation [8],

One  way  to  appreciate  the  role  of  dead  space  is  to  study  an  idealized  APD  where  electrons  can 

impact ionize continuously, i.e., no dead space, hence the gain G=I0 exp(gL) along the length (L) of 

the device, where g is the gain per unit length. In this case, the associated shot noise power can be 

written as

only  applies  to  thick  APDs  where  the  dead  space  length  is  negligible  compared  with  the  device 

thickness. Introducing the dead space will predict F(<M>) to be less than the value predicted by 

Eq. (7) (but never <1).  

     

If the definition of F(<M>)  is maintained, we should rewrite Eq. (1) and the experimentally 

measured excess noise factor has an effective value 

     

 

γ F(<M>) = SI(0)/(2e<M>2 I0),                                                          (9) 

where the coefficient γ is closely related to the Fano factor. Although γ=1 when <M>=1, there is 

no  reason  to  assume  this  is  true  when  <M>≠1.  We  note  that  here  γ  is  treated  as  a  numerical 

coefficient,  which  depends  on  <M>  in  a  complex  way  and  will  be  evaluated  using  Monte  Carlo 

simulations.  

     

At  low  (~2)  gains,  the  multiplication  process  may  be  sub-Poisson.  An  impact  ionization 

event at an earlier time t1 near the first heterojunction may prevent another impact ionization (from 

the same parent photoelectron) until after t2. This is analogous to a traveling high-energy particle 

producing ion pairs along its way. Earlier ionizations lead to lower probability for ionizations later 

on.  Such  a  negative  correlation  results  in  a  Fano  factor  <  1  [19].  This  happens  when  the  energy 

budget is limited (or for an APD with a fixed value of gain, such as <M>~2).  We note that the 

negative correlation is less significant, if present at all, in homojunction APDs because the spatial 

locations of ionization events are more randomized [14]. At high gains, the multiplication process 

may  become  super-Poisson.  That  is,  an  ionization  event  at  t1  will  lead  to  more  and  more  impact 

 

6

ionization  events  later  on,  just  as  in  the  case  of  a  secondary  electron  dynode  [17].  This  is  only 

viable with an unlimited energy budget, which may be achieved for an APD by increasing the bias 

voltage.  

    

In the Monte Carlo model described in Ref. [15], F(<M>) was calculated using the statistics 

of output electrons and the results would be the same if the initial photo electrons were injected at 

the  same  time  or  injected  continuously.  Figures  3  and  4  show  the  electron  ionization  event 

distribution inside the APD and the current pulses, assuming the initial electrons are all injected at 

t=0. The electron ionization events form peaks near both heterojunctions, and the magnitudes of the 

peaks  depend  strongly  on  the  average  gain.  Consequently,  the  pulse  shapes  vary  with  gain, 

implying different intra-pulse correlations at different gain values. At higher (~20) gains, the peak 

near  the  second  heterojunction  dominates  [15]  and  the  intra-pulse  correlations  may  be  less 

important.   

            To  calculate  noise  spectra  using  the  autocorrelation  method,  the  photoelectrons  must  be 

injected  in  a  span  of  time.  We  make  the  following  assumptions  in  the  present  Monte  Carlos 

simulation: (a) The initial photoelectrons are independent of each other in time and follow Poisson 

statistics.  (b)  We  neglect  the  interactions  among  all  the  electrons,  thus  avoiding  possible 

complications due to the correlations introduced by electron Coulomb interactions. The APD in this 

work has a thickness of ~100 nm and a diameter of ~160 µm, and is biased at ~10 V. In the low 

(<10) gain regime, the amplified current is in the order of micro-amps. This corresponds to a very 

low  (1011  cm-3)  electron  density  and  the  resulting  electric  field  is  negligible  compared  with  the 

external field. (c) We neglect the quantum reflection or tunneling of carriers at heterojunctions. Due 

to  the  higher  carrier  energy  (>  1eV)  involved  in  APDs,  the  reflection  and  tunneling  at  the 

 

7

heterojunctions are not important [20]. Under these assumptions, any correlations in the simulated 

current result from impact ionizations.  

               The  current  is  recorded  as  a  function  of  time,  using  the  Ramo-Shockley  theorem

where m’ = 1x106, m = 3x104 and a time step ∆t = 50 fs are used.    

            We  have  simulated  the  scenario  that  105  electrons  are  photo-generated  steadily  in  a  large 

(compared  with  time  scales  of  measurements  and  electron  transport)  time  interval  T=50 

nanoseconds. Shot noise can be directly calculated from the autocorrelation function <I(t)I(t+ τ)> 

of  the  resulting  noisy,  continuous  current.  The  power  spectra  of  the  autocorrelation  function, 

divided by 2eI0

 <M>2 and then normalized to the value for <M>=1.0 at 0 Hz, are plotted in Fig. 5. 

The  overall  shapes  of  these  curves  change  drastically,  and  contain  information  about  the  carrier 

temporal correlations at various frequencies. In this Letter, we focus on the values near the 0-Hz 

end of the curves. These values in Fig. 5, denoted as γ F(<M>), are plotted in Fig. 6. The 3σ error 

bars  are  calculated  based  on  statistics  of  16  independent  sets  of  simulations  with  independent 

random  number  generators.  It  can  be  seen  that  γ  F(<M>)  for  gain  values  between  2  and  6  are 

firmly below 1. This qualitatively reproduces the measured excess noise factor in Fig. 1.  

    

 In conclusion, the spatial correlations of impact ionizations and the corresponding temporal 

correlations  of  amplified  currents  in  an  APD  can  result  in  a  suppressed  excess  noise  factor.  This 

phenomenon  is  most  profound  in  thin,  heterostructure  APDs  where  heterojunctions  help  localize 

 

8

ionization events, thus introducing strong correlations within current pulses. These correlations are 

gain-dependent because the localizations of impact ionizations depend on the gain values. Monte 

Carlo simulations reconcile the apparent conflict between the fact that some measured APD excess 

noise factors are less than 1 while mathematically it is required that F(<M>)≥ 1. The reason lies in 

the fact that what actually measured in experiments is γ F(<M>) not F(<M>). Finally, we note that 

this shot noise suppression mechanism could not be utilized to improve the signal-to-noise ratios of 

APDs, as the amplified current signal is within itself correlated for the same reasons.

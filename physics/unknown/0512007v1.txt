Abstract 

 
In some experiments and applications there is need for large-area photosensitive detectors to 
operate at cryogenic temperatures. Nowadays, vacuum PMs are usually used for this purpose. 
We have developed special designs of planar photosensitive gaseous detectors able to operate 
at cryogenic temperatures. Such detectors are much cheaper PMs and are almost insensitive to 
magnetic  fields.  Results  of  systematic  measurements  of  their  quantum  efficiencies,  the 
maximum achievable gains and long-term stabilities will be presented. 
 The successful operation of these detectors open realistic possibilities in replacing PMs by 
photosensitive gaseous detectors in some applications dealing with cryogenic liquids; for 
example in experiments using noble liquid TPCs or noble liquid scintillating calorimeters. 

 
 
1. Introduction 
 
    Noble liquids such as LAr, LKr and LXe are unique detecting medias: 1) their stopping 
power is high enough for many applications, 2) they are excellent scintillators, emitting in the 
VUV region of spectra, 3) primary electrons created inside the liquid could easily be drifted 
and collected on an electrode structure providing one with a charge signal, 4) if necessary, 
primary electrons could even be extracted from the liquids to the gas phase (vapours above 
the liquid layer) and collected on electrodes placed there. These properties make them 
attractive for several applications, for example noble liquids scintillating calorimeters [1], 
cryogenic TPCs [2], cryogenic PETs [3]. Nowadays, expensive PMs are used for the detection 
of the scintillation light in these devices [4]. There have also been some attempts to use solid 
–state detectors [5].  
    We have recently demonstrated that costly PMs and solid-state devices could be replaced 
by gaseous photosensitive detectors: detectors with a window (which could be immersed 
inside the noble liquids) or windowless, able to operate in pure noble gases or vapors above 
the noble liquids [6]. The advantages of these detectors are: a large sensitive area, the 
possibility to choosing construction materials with low radioactivity levels and the practical 
insensitivity to the magnetic fields. Due to these properties gaseous detectors are now 
considered as an option for XENON [7] and ZEPLIN  [8] WIMPs detectors and cryogenic 
PETs [9]. 

    The aim of this paper to develop prototypes of photosensitive gaseous detectors oriented on 
real experiments and perform the systematic studies of these devices.  
 
 
2. Detector’s Designs and Experimental Set Up 
 
    Two types of planar photosensitive detectors were constructed and tested in the frame of 
this work: the wire- type and the hole- type detectors. The schematic drawing of one of our 
wire detector (WD) mostly used in this work show in Fig. 1 (the description of other wire-
type detectors can found in  [6]).

 Its cathode was made from two parts: a stainless steal (ss) semi cylinder having a diameter of 
2, 5 cm and a length of 5 cm was combined with a metalized MgF2 window. Inside this 
structure a golden-coated tungsten anode wire was installed. The diameters of the anode wires 
tested were of 50 and 25 µm. The inner part of the ss semi cylinder was coated by a CsI layer 
0,4mm thick. The distance between the semi cylinder and the MgF2 window was 1 mm. This 
structure. The cathode parts were grounded; the high voltage was applied to the anode wire. 
This entire structure was placed inside a compact planar gas chamber (with a diameter of 10 
cm) and filled either with Ar+10%CH4 or He+10%H2 at a total pressure p=1. 
    The hole- types detectors used in most these studies were either capillary plates (CPs) 
obtained from Hamamatsu or “home made CPs” (HMCPs) manufactured by us. The 
Hamamatsu CPs had a thickness of 0,8 mm and a diameter of 20 mm, whilst the diameter of 
the capillaries was 100 µm. Most of the measurements in this work were done with double 
CPs operating in cascade mode (see Fig. 2). The distance between the CPs (we named them 
“top” and bottom”) was 2 mm. The cathode of the top CP was coated with a CsI layer 0,25 
µm in thickness. The anode of the bottom CP was in direct contact with the readout plate.

 In some particular measurements, for example under conditions with a high risk of sparking, 
(HMCPs) were used.  They were made of G-10, had thickness of 1mm, a diameter of 20mm 
whilst the diameters of the holes were of 0,3 mm. The advantages of these detectors are the 
very low price and the possibility of achieving gains higher then with CPs. We also used these 
detectors in a cascaded mode. The cathode of the top HMCP was coated by a CsI layer 0,4 
µm in thickness.   
   The cascaded hole-type detectors were installed inside a small gas chamber filled either 
with He+10%H2 (in the case of CPs) or with pure noble gases: Xe or Ar (as in the case of 
HMCPs) at a p=1. 
    In all experiments the gas chambers were attached to other chambers which we named a 
“scintillation chamber”(see Fig.1 in [6a]). This chamber was filled with on of the noble gases: 
Xe, Kr or Ar and contained a radioactive source (241Am, 106Ru, 109Cd or 55Fe). These sources 
produced scintillation lights recorded by the photosensitive gaseous detectors. In some 
experiments the window separating the gas and the scintillation chamber was removed, so that 
the detector in the gas chamber was filled by the same noble gas as the scintillation chamber.  
    These two chambers coupled to each other were installed inside the cryostat allowing 
controllable cooling to be made from room temperature until LN2 temperature (see [6c] for 
more details). While being located in the cryostat, the detectors could be run in two modes: 
flushed by a gas so that the pressure was kept at 1 atm, (“flushed detector”) or filled by a gas 
to a p=1 atm at room temperature, sealed and then cooled so that the density remained 
constant during cooling and all measurements taken (“sealed detector”). In some 
measurements our gas chambers were directly immersed inside the LN2, LAr or cooled 
alcohol. 
    Besides the scintillation light produced by the radioactive sources, in some measurements 
we also used external UV sources: a pulsed H2 lamp (a few ns pulse durations) and 

continuous Hg lamp. The pulse lamp was very convenient in measuring the detector’s gain 
and feedbacks [10]. The Hg lamp was used for measurements with single photoelectrons.  
     The absolute quantum efficiencies (QE) of our detectors were measured at room 
temperatures using a monochromator combined with a continuous Hamamatsu H2 lamp. The 
intensity of the spectral resolved light beam from the H2 lamp was measured by an ionization 
chamber filled with TMAE vapors in which the QE is well known. After these measurements, 
the relative changes in the QE were continuously monitored (this time without the 
monochromator) during all measurements (cooling, warm up) by measuring a photocurrent or 
a counting rate produce by the Hg lamp.  
 
3. Results 
 
    The gain vs. voltage for the WD filled with Ar+CH4 is presented in figure Fig 3. One can 
see that within this mixture the maximum achievable gain was very high: WDAm >  106. In 
spite of the fact that this detector could operate close to the limited Geiger mode, at gains of 
WDAf  >5 x104 photo feedback appeared. Note that for applications dealing with rare events  
(such as WIMP search or ICARUS) the feedback in photo-detectors was not a serious 
problem since the afterpulses appeared with a delay and could easily be excluded from the 
data processing.  In these applications it is much more important to reach a high gain allowing 
one to achieve 100% efficiency for the detection of the photoelectrons.

symbols) at temperatures of T= 293 K and 120 K, and in a sealed mode (open triangles) at T=120 K. 
 
 In He+H2 mixture the maximum achievable gain  WDAm < 106. The peculiarity of this mixture 
was that at low temperatures the flushed detector with the anode wire of 50 µm in diameter 
could transit from an avalanche to a self-quenched streamer mode-see Fig. 4.  This effect is 
well known and was connected to the large diameter of the anode wire used and with the 
elevated density of the gas when it cooled [11]. In the case of a thin wire or in the case of the 
sealed detector, it operated in avalanche mode at any temperatures tested in this work. The 
feedback in the sealed appeared at WDAf > 104.  
    Thus one can conclude that in the case of the WD in both gas mixtures and at any given 
conditions WDAm >   WDAf. As expected, in both mixtures the gain of sealed detector 
practically did not changed with the temperature.

Results of the measurements the QE for WD, CPs and HMCPs are shown in Fig. 5. One can 
see that in He+H2 gas mixture the QE is almost ten times lower than in the case of the 
Ar+CH4 mixture.  This is due to the strong backdiffusion of the photoelectrons in this mixture 
[6a].

The gain vs. voltage for the CPs is presented in Fig. 6. One can see that the maximum 
achievable gain of the cascaded CPs is much lower than for WDs:  CPAm < 105, however CPs 
operated without any feedbacks up to gains of up to those close to breakdowns: CPAf ~ CPAm. 
Thus CPs are preferred in applications when one has to avoid afterpulses caused by 
feedbacks.

Voltage across the HMCPs (V)

Fig. 7. Gain vs. voltage for single (solid symbols) and cascaded (open symbols) HMCPs in Xe (squares and 
triangles) or Ar (rhombus and circles) in flushed mode. 
 
    As was mentioned above, in some measurements the window was removed in order for the 
hole-type detectors to operate in the same noble gases as the scintillation chambers. In these 

 

 

measurements one has to avoid damages of the expensive CPs by possible sparks so HMCPs 
have to be used. As an example Fig. 7 shows the gain vs. voltage for HMCPs operating in Xe 
and Ar. One can see that with double HMCPs operating in a cascade mode one can reach 
gains of HMCPAm ~ 103. In this case we also observed that  HMCPAm ~ HMCPAf.  
 
   All of our detectors were cooled and warmed up to room temperatures several times. The 
QE of the detectors was continuously monitored during all of these manipulations for a total 
time of three months. During this time interval the total time when the detectors were cooled 
was 50-80 hours. The results of the QE monitoring could be summarized as follows. For 
sealed detectors the changes in the QE was not more than a few %. For flushed detectors, the 
measured QE degraded with temperature to about 10-20%. This was simply due to the 
increase of the photoelectrons back diffusion with the gas density. Indeed, the same effect was 
observed when these detectors were pressurized at room temperature.  
 
4. Conclusions 
 
   For the detection of the scintillation light from the LXe one can use WDs filled with 
Ar+CH4 gas mixture which allow one to achieve a high gain and a high QE. For the 
temperatures below 120K, to avoid the liquidation of the gas inside the WD, one has to use 
He+H2, and the price to pay for this is the lost of the QE due to the strong back diffusion 
effect. In both gas mixtures WDs can operate at higher gains than CPs; however, CP operated 
without any feedback afterpulses. These results could be summaries as follows: 
WDAf  <CPAm ~ CPAf  < WDAm. 
 In pure noble gases HMCPs worked quite stabile. In spite the fact that their QE was not very 
high, one can compensate this by using large- area detectors. 
    Results obtained in this work indicate that photosensitive gaseous detectors (with windows 
and without) offer a cheap and simple alternative approach to PMs and solid -state detectors. 
This may open their applications to large-scale detectors such as cryogenic TPCs, PETs and 
noble liquid calorimeters.

We  present  an  approach  to  numerically  solving  the  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation  and  other 
parabolic  equations  by  the  split-step  technique  with  fast  Fourier  transform,  which  suppresses  the 
backreflection of waves from the grid boundaries with any specified accuracy. Most importantly, all known 
methods work well only for a narrow region of incident waves spectrum, and the proposed method provides 
absorption of any wave whose length is large enough in comparison with the size of absorption region.

the 

For  a  number  of  reasons,  the  split-step  technique  with  fast 
Fourier  transform  (FFT)  is  often  most  efficient  for  numerically 
time-dependent 
solving 
the  parabolic  equations  and 
Schrödinger  equation,  as  a  special  case.  Here 
the  multi-
dimensional grid appears to be closed. In a 2D case, for example, 
we have a toroidal topology. This means that if some wave packet 
comes to the grid boundary it will pass through and appear at the 
opposite  side.  However,  when  solving  a  physical  problem,  one 
often deals with a part of infinite space. This raises the problem of 
absorbing 
the  grid 
the  backreflection  of  all  waves  from 
boundaries.  Traditionally,  this  problem  is  solved  by  using  an 
imaginary  potential  in  some  absorption  region  at  the  grid 
boundary  (see,  for  example,  [2]).  Parameters  of  the  imaginary 
potential  are  chosen  experimentally,  depending  on  which  waves 
should  be  absorbed.  Recent  paper  [3]  has  reported  some 
modification  of  this  method,  which,  however,  does  not  make  it 
free  from  a  significant  drawback.  It  appears  that  this  method 
provides  relatively  good  results  only  for  a  narrow  region  of 
incident waves spectrum. Short waves pass through the absorption 
region,  whereas  long  waves  are  reflected.  Here  the  size  of  the 
absorption  region  should  considerably  exceed  the  absorbed 
wavelength.  In  addition,  parameters  of  the  imaginary  potential 
need  to  be  re-chosen  for  each  new  problem.  In  this  paper,  we 
propose  a  technique  that  provides  absorption  of any  wave  whose 
length  is  large  enough  in  comparison  with  the  size  of  the 
absorption region. In the multidimensional case it means that one 
can  use  this  method  to  absorb  waves  with  different  angles  of 
incidence. The analogous problem for electromagnetic waves has 
been already solved with perfectly matched layer (PML) technique 
[5].  Most  importantly,  in  the  proposed  method  it  is  possible  to 
derive a precise formula for calculating errors and to determine the 
applicability domain.           

For  simplicity,  we  will  consider  a  one-dimensional  case.  Let 
us  assume  a  one-dimensional  grid,  on  which  we  solve  the  time-
dependent dimensionless Schrödinger equation:

,  then  we  obtain  an  absorption 

of  incoming  wave  packet  [2].  It  appears,  however,  that  by 
choosing  parameter  m ,  we  can  have  satisfactory  absorption 
only  for  a  narrow  band  of  the  wave  packet  spectrum, 
0L . Short 
corresponding to waves with a wavelength exceeding 
waves  pass  through  the  absorption  region,  whereas  long  waves 
are reflected. This gives rise to an idea of a method in which the 
absorption  coefficient  m   is  dependent  on  the  wavelength.  Let

  is  a  function  that  determines  the  suppression 

method.  However,  we  will  consider  a  specific  case  with  the 
following  considerations.  The  propagation  velocity  of  waves 
with a wave number  k  is proportional to  k . The wave packet 
which has the mean velocity  k  will pass through the absorption 

1−k

  and  according  to  (4)  its 
region  in  time  proportional  to 
amplitude  will  exponentially  decrease  while  it  passes  through 
the  region.  If  we  want  to  affect  equally  all  wave  packets  we 
should  choose  the  rate  of  amplitude  decreasing  proportional  to 
k . Therefore, the absorption rate of 
kC  should be proportional 
to  k .  Thus  we  obtain  the  following  form  of  the  equation 
describing the absorption:

jump  because  of 

where  β  is  an  absorption  rate  coefficient.  In  this  approach, 
however,  we  will  have  a  sharp 
the 
disagreement  between  wave  function  values  at  points  at  the 
absorption  region  boundaries,  resulting  in  the  formation  of  a 
broad spectrum of wave packet, although in the whole space the 
wave  packet  traveling  to  the  absorption  region  may  have  a 
narrow spectrum. Thus, the spectrum will contain harmonics of 
the  waves  non-existent  in  the  whole  space.  It  is  clear,  that  the 
suppression of a wave may be interpreted as a generation of the 

the absorption region for different wavelengths. So, we need to 
generate the test wave with different values of the wavelength.  

Below  we  discuss  how  to  solve  this  problem.  The  problem 
of wave generation is equal to the absorption problem. The wave 
function should be affected in some region (“generation” region) 
by using the absorption method for difference between the wave 
function  and  the  analytically  described  test  wave.  For  this 
purpose, during each iteration, the following procedures should 
be performed: 

 

1. 

In  the  wave  generation  region,  determine  the  difference 
between  the  wave  function  and  the  analytically  described 
test wave:

It  is  clear,  that  in  the  generation  region  these  procedures  make 
the  wave  function  close  to  the  test  wave.  As  the  test  wave 
corresponds  to  the  dispersion  relation  for  equation  (1)  in  free 
space, the test wave goes out of the generation region. So we get 
the  wave  generation.  These  procedures  also  provide  absorption 
of all other waves which come to the generation region. 

Below  we  will  present  the  results  of  comparison  of  this 
method  with  the  imaginary  potential  method.  To  compare  the 
methods,  the  test  wave  was  generated  using  the  imaginary 
potential  method.  Some  time  after  the  start  of  generation,  a 
picture  was  set  in,  where  the  transmitted  and  reflected  waves 
could be distinguished. Below we plot (Fig. 1) the dependences 
of the sum of squares of reflection and transmission coefficients 
of  the  test  wave  (T  and  D)  on  the  log  of  the  ratio  of  the 
0L   to  the  wavelength  λ  for  the  both 
absorption  region  length 
methods  (the  imaginary  potential  method  with  three  different 
values  of  the  parameter  m   and  the  proposed  method  with

same  wave  with  the  opposite  phase.  Thus,  absorption  of  non-
existent  waves  will  efficiently  lead  to  waves  generation  and, 
consequently,  to  weak  absorption,  as  we  observed  in  numerical 
experiment. To avoid this, it is reasonable to affect only a part of 
the wave function by using a “mask” evenly smoothing the edges 
to zero:

should be chosen based on the required accuracy of calculations. It 
was  found  in  numerical  experiments  (Fig.  1)  that  the  absorption 
result  is  well  described  by  formula  (7)  for  absorbed  wavelengths 
not  exceeding  a  certain  value  that  decreases  with  the  parameter 
β. 

Further we will describe in brief the algorithm scheme. During 
each  iteration,  in  addition  to  the  step  operation  of  the  split-step 
method, the following procedures should be performed:

Since  the  Schrödinger  equation  and  the  absorption  methods 
are  linear,  for  comparison  it  is  enough  to  determine  the 
coefficients of reflection and transmission of a test wave through

described method for the difference between the wave function 
of the electron and the analytically described plane wave, which 
we  want  to  make  the  incident  wave.  As  a  result,  we  will  get  a 
generation  of  the  incident  wave  at the  left  boundary.  It  is clear 
that  first  the  incident  wave  front  will  enter  the  grid  and  then  it 
will be changed when passing the potential. Some time later, the 
fronts  of  transmitted  and  reflected  waves  will  reach  the  grid 
boundary  and  the  probability  distribution  will  become  static. 
The time dependence will persist only as a phase change. 

It  can  be  seen  that  the  parameter  β  in  the  proposed  method 
can  be  chosen  to  provide  better  result,  as  compared  to  the 
imaginary  potential  method,  for  all  wavelengths.  Note  that  the 
imaginary  potential  method  works  very  poorly  for  high  and  low 
frequencies with the exception of the narrow region centered at the 
, depending on amplitude  m , whereas the 
definite value of  λ0L
proposed method is free of this feature and in the high-frequency 
region  it  provides  stable  absorption  of  waves,  corresponding  to 
formula (7). This stable absorption begins already for wavelengths 
that only 1.3 – 1.5 times exceed the length of the absorption region 
(for 

48.0=β
The  comparison  with  the  approach  proposed  in  [3]  (referred 
below  as  “filtered”)  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  Here  a   is  a  filter 
absorption  coefficient,  b   is  an  imaginary  potential  coefficient.  It 
can be also seen that the proposed method, by appropriate choice 
of the parameter  β, can be made better than the filtered method 
for all wavelengths.

wavelength  λ. Filtered method – dotted lines; proposed method –

Let  us  now  discuss  additional  possibilities  provided  by  the 
proposed method for solving the scattering problem. The method 
can be easily generalized for a multi-dimensional case. For this we 
should use the one-dimensional procedure independently for every 
for  each  dimension.  However,  when 
line,  column,  etc., 
numerically  solving  the  scattering  problem,  one  can  significantly 
improve the results by further modifying the proposed technique. 

The  scattering  problem  is  put  as  follows.  For  simplicity,  we 
will consider a 2D case. We assume that there is a 2D grid with a 
certain  distribution  of  potential  that  comes  to  a  constant  value  at 
the grid boundary.  In the example given below, the potential has 

the  form

in  free  space,  hits  the  potential  from  the  left.  When  numerically 
solving the Schrödinger equation (8), it is required to calculate in 
the whole space the wave function of the electron scattered by the 
potential. 

The  numerical  experiment  can  be  arranged  as  follows. 
Initially, the wave function of the electron is zero on the grid. At 
the  grid  boundary,  this  function  is  affected  by  using  the  above-

 

FIG. 3. Probability distribution in 2D scattering problem. (a) 

– the imaginary potential method; (b) – the proposed method. 

The result of the numerical experiment conducted using the 
imaginary potential technique is shown in Fig. 3(a). One can see 
dark regions at the upper and lower boundaries, which get wider 
to the right boundary. These perturbations occurring above and 
below  correspond  to  reflections  from  the  upper  and  lower 
boundaries. This is due to the following fact. Far away from the 
center  of  the  potential,  the  analytic  solution  for  the  scattering 
problem  is  the  sum  of  two  parts,  a  scattered  wave  and  the 
incident  plane  wave.  If  the  potential  decays  insufficiently  fast, 
the  incident  plane  wave  has  an  additive  to  the  phase,  which  is 
proportional to log of  rr  (for Coulomb potential, see [4]) even 
far  away  from  the  center  of  the  potential.  As  a  result,  at  the 
upper  and  lower  boundaries  we  suppress  a  wave  that  differs 
from  a  required  one  only  by  phase.  This  corresponds  to 
generation  of  one  more  wave  that  differs  only  by  phase.  As  a 
result  of  the  interference  of  these  waves,  we  obtain  the 
distribution shown in Fig. 3(a). To avoid this, it is possible, for 
example,  not  to  absorb  a  wave  traveling  along  the  upper  and 
lower  boundaries,  i.e.,  to  absorb  only  a  scattered  wave.  This 
means  that  in  the  proposed  method  waves  that  are  long  in  the 
transverse direction should not be absorbed. To achieve this, one 
should use expression:

rather than the expression (5), thereby performing absorption with 
wavelength  discrimination.  Thus  there  will  be  no  absorption  for 
kC  with  k  lower or equal to unity which correspond 
coefficients 
to  waves  that  are  the  longest  in  the  transverse  direction.  The 
distribution  provided  by  this  modification  is  shown  in  Fig.  3(b). 
We can see that there are no dark regions, which were in Fig. 3(a). 
The figure shows that the area of the grid where the wave function 
is  free  of  parasitical  distortions  is  about  two  times  larger  than  in 
the case of imaginary potential method Fig. 3(a). That means that 
the use of this modification of the proposed method instead of the 
imaginary potential method for the 2D scattering problem allows 
to get the same results on two times smaller grid. Moreover, in the 
3D  scattering  problem  this  modification  allows  to  use  four  times 
smaller grid. 

It should be noted in conclusion that suggested method can 
be  used  for  solving  any  parabolic  equations  by  the  split-step 
technique  with  fast  Fourier  transform.  It  is  important  that  after 
appropriated  choosing  of  the  parameters  it  works  better  than 
well-known  imaginary  potential  method  for  any  wave  packets 
which  should  be  absorbed.  Also  this  method  allows  to 
selectively  affect  the  different  harmonics  of  the  wave  packet. 
This  feature  can  be  very  useful  for  some  physical  problems. 
Besides, 
is  very  good  for  waves 
generation. In general, the proposed technique allows not only to 
significantly  reduce  the  size  of  the  absorption  region,  but  to 
research  some  new  problems  when  numerically  solving  the 
parabolic equations.

Casimir invariants and characteristic identities for gl(∞)

M.D. Gould and N.I. Stoilova*
Department of Mathematics, University of Queensland, Brisbane Qld 4072, Australia

A full set of (higher order) Casimir invariants for the Lie algebra gl(∞) is constructed and
shown to be well deﬁned in the category OF S generated by the highest weight (unitarizable)
irreducible representations with only a ﬁnite number of non-zero weight components. Moreover
the eigenvalues of these Casimir invariants are determined explicitly in terms of the highest
weight. Characteristic identities satisﬁed by certain (inﬁnite) matrices with entries from gl(∞)
are also determined and generalize those previously obtained for gl(n) by Bracken and Green.1,2

I. INTRODUCTION

In recent years inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras have become a subject of interest in both mathematics
and physics (see Refs. 3 and 4 and the references therein). We mention as an example, related to the
topic of the present article, that the Lie algebra gl(∞) and its completion and central extension a∞ play an
important role in the theory of soliton equations,5,6 string theory, two dimensional statistical models, etc.7
In addition these algebras provide an example of Kac-Moody Lie algebras of inﬁnite type.3,8

In this paper, we derive a full set of Casimir invariants for the inﬁnite dimensional general linear
Lie algebra gl(∞), corresponding to the following matrix realization (see the notation at the end of the
Introduction),

gl(∞) = {x = (aij)| i, j ∈ N, all but a f inite number of aij ∈ C are zero}.

(1)

Characteristic identities satisﬁed by certain inﬁnite matrices with entries from gl(∞) are also determined
and generalize those obtained by Bracken and Green1,2 for gl(n). Such identities are of interest and have
found applications to state labeling problems9 and to the determination of Racah-Wigner coeﬃcients.10

A basis for the Lie algebra gl(∞) is given by the Weyl generators eij, i, j ∈ N, satisfying the commu-

tation relations:

[eij, ekl] = δjkeil − δliekj.

The category O generated by highest weight irreducible gl(∞) modules, corresponding to the ”Borel” sub-
algebra

N+ = lin. env.{eij|i < j ∈ N},

has been constructed in Ref. 11. By deﬁnition each gl(∞) module V ∈ O contains a unique (up to a
multiplicative constant) vector vΛ, the highest weight vector, with the properties:

N+vΛ = 0,

eiivΛ = ΛivΛ,

∀i ∈ N.

The highest weight Λ ≡ (Λ1, Λ2, Λ3, . . .) of V ∈ O uniquely labels the module, V ≡ V (Λ). Moreover
all unitarizable irreducible highest weight gl(∞) modules V (Λ), corresponding to the natural conjugation
operation: (eij )† = eji, ∀i, j ∈ N, have been determined.11 The module V (Λ) ∈ O carries an unitarizable
representation of gl(∞) if and only if

Λi − Λj ∈ Z+, ∀i < j ∈ N, Λi ∈ R, ∀i ∈ N.

In the paper we will consider the category OF S ⊂ O, of modules generated by all unitarizable irreducible
gl(∞) modules with a ﬁnite number of non-zero highest weight components Λi. These are modules V (Λ)
with highest weights

Λ ≡ (Λ1, Λ2, . . . , Λk, 0, . . .) ≡ (Λ1, Λ2, . . . , Λk, ˙0).

(6)

The paper is organized as follows. Section II gives some useful results on the representations of gl(∞)
with a ﬁnite number of non-zero components of the highest weight.
III we construct a full set
of convergent Casimir invariants on each module V (Λ). Section IV is devoted to the computation of the
eigenvalues of these Casimir invariants for all modules from the subcategory OF S. In Section V we present a
derivation of the polynomial identities satisﬁed by certain matrices with entries from gl(∞), which generalize
those obtained previously for gl(n).

In Sec.

Throughout the paper we use the following notation:
irrep(s) - irreducible representation(s);
lin.env. {X} - the linear envelope of X;
C - the complex numbers;
R - the real numbers;
Z+ - all non-negative integers;
N - all positive integers;
U (A) - the universal enveloping algebra of A.

II. PRELIMINARIES

Denote by H the Cartan subalgebra of gl(∞). The space H ∗ dual to H is described by the forms
εi, i ∈ N, where εi : x → aii, and x is given by (1) only for diagonal x. Let ( , ) be the bilinear form
∞
on H ∗ deﬁned by (ǫi, ǫj) = δij . For a weight µ =
i=1 µiεi ∈ H ∗ with µi being complex numbers we
write µ ≡ (µ1, µ2, . . . , µn, . . .). The roots εi − εj (i 6= j) of gl(∞) are the non-zero weights of the adjoint
P
representation. The positive roots are given by the set:

Φ+ = {εi − εj|1 ≤ i < j ∈ N}.

ρ =

(1 − 2i)ǫi.

Dn = {ν|ν = (ν1, . . . , νn, ˙0), νi ∈ Z+},

k ⊂ D+

F S, corresponding to the

natural conjugation operation, generate the subcategory OF S ⊂ O of unitarizable gl(∞) modules (6);

2). Each module V (Λ) gives rise to a unitarizable module for the canonical subalgebra gl(n) ⊂ gl(∞)
with generators eij, i, j = 1, . . . , n. In general V (Λ) is a reducible gl(n) module, more precisely it is a
completely reducible gl(n) module;

3). If ν is a weight in V (Λ), then ν ∈ Dn, for some n ∈ Z+.

Let Λn be the projection of the gl(∞) highest weight Λ ∈ D+

k onto the weight space of gl(n) so that,

Λn = (Λ1, . . . , Λk, 0, . . . , 0n) = (Λ1, . . . , Λk, ˙0n−k).

vector v+

Λ ∈ V (Λ) is irreducible with highest weight Λn.

(ii) If v ∈ V (Λ) is a weight vector of weight ν ∈ Dn, then v ∈ Vn(Λ).

Proof: (i) The cyclic gl(n) module Vn(Λ) generated by v+

Λ is well known to be indecomposable (see
for instance Ref. 12). The result then follows from the complete reducibility of V (Λ) considered as a gl(n)
module.

(ii) Let v ∈ V (Λ) have weight ν ∈ Dn. From the Poincar´e-Birkhoﬀ-Witt theorem we may write

with N− the subalgebra of gl(∞) generated by all negative root vectors

The weight ν ∈ H ∗ has the form

and mi = 0 for all but a ﬁnite number of i. Since ν ∈ Dn, mi = 0 for i > n so that

In view of the linear independence of the simple roots εi − εi+1, (16) implies that

Therefore v is a vector from the gl(n) module Vn(Λ), v ∈ Vn(Λ).

Consider the gl(∞) modules V (Λ) and V (µ), with highest weights Λ ∈ D+

k and µ ∈ D+

l , respectively.

Take the tensor product of them

and suppose that v+
linear combination of vectors of the form

ν is a gl(∞) highest weight vector in (18). Then for some n,

ν ∈ D+

ν is a

V (Λ) ⊗ V (µ),

v ⊗ w,

v+
ν ∈ Vn(Λ) ⊗ Vn(µ).

Since Λ has k and µ has l non-zero components, then ν can have at most k + l non-zero components, so that
n ≤ k + l. Hence w.l.o.g. we may take n = k + l. Thus if v+

ν is a gl(∞) highest weight vector in (18) then

is a gl(n) highest weight vector. Conversely, given a gl(n) highest weight vector

we have

since all weights in V (Λ) and V (µ) have entries in Z+. Therefore v+
ν must be a gl(∞) highest weight vector.
Vn(Λ) and Vn(µ) are gl(n) irreducible modules with highest weights Λn and µn respectively. For their tensor
product decomposition we write

Vn(Λ) ⊗ Vn(µ) ≡ V (Λn) ⊗ V (µn) = ⊕νmνV (νn) ≡ ⊕νmνVn(ν),

(22)

where ν ≡ (νn, ˙0).

Hence we have proved:
Theorem 2: The irreducible gl(n) module decomposition

Vn(Λ) ⊗ Vn(µ) = ⊕νmνVn(ν),

V (Λ) ⊗ V (µ) = ⊕νmνV (ν),

Therefore the matrix traces

are formally Casimir invariants. They are, however, divergent except for m = 1 in which case we obtain
the ﬁrst order invariant (25). The purpose of the present investigation is to construct a full set of Casimir
invariants which are well deﬁned and convergent on the category OF S.

The following is the main result of the paper:

IV. EIGENVALUE FORMULA FOR CASIMIR INVARIANTS

In this section we apply our previous results to evaluate the spectrum of the invariants (33).
Let v ∈ V (Λ), be an arbitrary vector of weight ν = (ν1, . . . , νr, ˙0). Then, keeping in mind Proposition
k has weight εj − εk under the adjoint representation of gl(∞) and that all vectors

deﬁned by (30) with i, j, k = 1, . . . , r and ¯A instead of A. It follows then that the formula (42) can be written

being the mth order invariant of gl(r). Formula (46) is valid ∀m ∈ N, which gives a recursion relation for
the Im with initial condition

I1v = χΛ(I1)v.

In particular it follows from (46) that the invariants Im are certainly convergent on all weight vectors
v ∈ V (Λ).

To determine the eigenvalues of Im let v = v+

Λ be the highest weight vector of the unitarizable module

V (Λ) and let

Λ = (¯Λ, ˙0) ∈ D+
k ,

¯Λ ≡ (Λ1, . . . , Λk).

Then for the eigenvalues of the Im one obtains the recursion relation (see (46)):

χΛ(Im) = χ ¯Λ(I (k)

V. POLYNOMIAL IDENTITIES

Let ∆ be the comultiplication on the enveloping algebra U [gl(∞)] of gl(∞) (∆(eij ) = eij ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗
eij, i, j ∈ N, with 1 being the unit in U [gl(∞)]). Applying ∆ to the second order Casimir invariant (27) of
gl(∞) we obtain:

Therefore

∆(I2) = I2 ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ I2 + 2

eij ⊗ eji.

eij ⊗ eji =

Denote by πε1 the irrep of gl(∞) aﬀorded by V (ε1). The weight spectrum for the vector module V (ε1)
consists of all weights εi, i = 1, 2, . . . , each occurring exactly once. Denote by Eij , i, j ∈ N the generators
on this space

with Eij an elementary matrix.

As for the algebra gl(n), we introduce the characteristic matrix

πε1 (eij) = Eij ,

A =

πε1 (eij)eji =

Eijeji =

Therefore A is the inﬁnite matrix introduced in Sec. III (see (29)) and the entries of the matrix powers Am
are given recursively by (30). We will show that the characteristic matrix satisﬁes a polynomial identity
acting on the gl(∞) module V (Λ), Λ ∈ D+
k . Let πΛ be the representation aﬀorded by V (Λ). From Eq. (60),
acting on V (Λ) we may interpret A as an invariant operator on the tensor product module V (ε1) ⊗ V (Λ) :

A ≡

(πε1 ⊗ πΛ) [∆(I2) − I2 ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ I2] .

From Theorem 2, we have for the tensor product decomposition

V (ε1) ⊗ V (Λ) = ⊕k+1
i=1

′ V (Λ + εi),

where the prime signiﬁes that it is necessary to retain only those summands for which Λ + εi ∈ D+
Therefore on each gl(∞) module V (Λ + εi) in (62), A takes the eigenvalue

F S.

[χΛ+εi (I2) − χε1 (I2) − χΛ(I2)] =

[(Λ + εi, Λ + εi + 2ρ) − (ε1, ε1 + 2ρ) − (Λ, Λ + 2ρ)] = Λi + 1 − i (63)

gl(n) by Bracken and Green 1,2 (more precisely their adjoint identities). It is worth noting, in view of the
decomposition (62), that these identities may frequently be reduced. Some reduced identities are indicated
below for certain choices Λ ∈ D+

F S of the gl(∞) highest weight:

Λ = ( ˙1k, ˙0) :
Λ = (k, ˙0) :
Λ = ( ˙pk, ˙ql, ˙0) :

(A − 1)(A + k) = 0;
(A + 1)(A − k) = 0;
(A − p)(A + k − q)(A + k + l) = 0, p < q.

Note: Sometimes the characteristic and reduced identities are the same; for instance in (65b) the reduced
identity coincides with the characteristic identity. This is in stark contrast to the characteristic identities for
gl(n).

More generally, having in mind (58), introduce a characteristic matrix

AΛ =

πΛ(eij)eji =

(πΛ ⊗ 1) [∆(I2) − I2 ⊗ 1 − 1 ⊗ I2] ,

Now applying Theorem 2, the decomposition of the tensor product space V (Λ)⊗V (µ) is given by the gl(k +l)
branching rule

Vn(Λ) ⊗ Vn(µ) = ⊕νmνVn(ν),

with n = k + l. Let {λi

These identities are obvious generalizations of those of Theorem 5 (see (64)). Note, in this case, that Eq.
(69) implies the reduced identity satisﬁed by the matrix AΛ on the gl(∞) module V (µ) given by

Casimir invariants for the inﬁnite dimensional general linear Lie algebra have been obtained explicitly,
and their eigenvalues on any irreducible highest weight unitarizable representation with a ﬁnite number
of non-zero weight components computed. With the help of the second order Casimir invariant we have
obtained characteristic identities for the Lie algebra gl(∞) which are a generalization of those for gl(n).

Is is well known that the invariants of ﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras play an important role in their
representation theory. However, for the inﬁnite dimensional Lie algebras corresponding full sets of Casimir
invariants have not yet been determined. The present paper is a step in solving this problem.

Abstract: We demonstrate a current-controlled magnetic guide that can transport atoms 

in the direction perpendicular to the waveguide. We have combined this with a light pulse 

Talbot-Lau interferometer that splits and recombines atom wavepackets along the free 

propagation direction of the waveguide, resulting in an interferometric path that encloses 

area and thus can be used to sense rotation. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rotation sensing has always been one of the most important proposed applications of 

atom interferometry because, as was pointed out by Clauser [1] almost thirty years ago, 

the  phase  shift  due  to  rotation  for  an  atom  interferometer  is  more  than  109  times  larger 

than  the  phase  shift/rotation  of  a  photon  interferometer  that  encloses  the  same  area; 

however,  the  phase  shift  is  proportional  to  area  and  the  area  enclosed  by  atom 

interferometers  have  been  significantly  smaller  than  those  enclosed  by  photon 

interferometers.  Free  space  atomic  gyroscopes  are  typically  limited  by  small  beam 

splitting  angles,  so  long  lengths  (~  2  m)  are  required  in  order  to  achieve  significant 

enclosed  areas  (~  22  mm2)  [2,  3].  Guided  atom  interferometers  have  attracted  lots  of 

attentions  since  atom  guides  can  send  atoms  around  square  or  circular  paths  with 

enclosed areas that can be much larger than the areas enclosed in free space [4-9], while 

remaining compact.    Atoms have been guided around paths that enclose areas up to 10 

cm2  on  centimeter-scale  devices  [6-9];  however,  it  has  not  been  demonstrated  that 

external  state  atomic  coherences  are  preserved  as  the  atoms  propagated  around  these 

guide  loops.  It  has  recently  been  shown  that  atom  wavepackets  confined  in  straight 

magnetic waveguides can be split and recombined to produce an atom interference signal 

that has a reproducible phase, but in these experiments no physical area is enclosed in the 

interference  pathways.  [10-12];  consequently,  these  interferometers  cannot  measure 

rotation.   

In this paper, we demonstrate a waveguide based atom interferometer that encloses 

area  and  could  be  used  for  rotation  sensing.    Guided  photon  rotation  sensors  use 

waveguide  beamspsitters  to  separate  and  recombine  the  guided  light  beams,  so  many 

proposed  guided  atom  interferometers  also  use  the  guiding  potentials  to  split  and 

recombine  the  atoms  [13-15].  Compare  with  photons,  response  of  atoms  to  the  guiding 

potential  is  more  dispersive  (e.g.,  energy  dependent),  and  beam  splitting  with  guiding 

potentials has proved to be very challenging, particularly if widely separated outputs are 

desired. [16]. In this paper we propose an alternate technique: while the magnetic guide 

transports the guided atoms along its transverse directions, the splitting and recombining 

of  the  matterwaves  are  realized  instead  by  standing  wave  pulses  acting  along  the  free 

propagation direction of the guide, (fig.1). This combination of optical beam splitting and 

magnetic guiding has already been shown to preserve phase when the magnetic guide is 

stationary  and  no  area  is  enclosed.[10-12]    In  this  paper  we  demonstrate  that  phase  is 

still preserved when the waveguide is translated, so that the interferometric paths enclose 

area  and  rotation  sensing  should  be  possible.  This  experiment  differs  from  various 

atom-chip based experiments with Bose-Einstein condensates as the atom sample here is 

thermal and is distributed over thousands of waveguide modes. This allows us to treat the 

transverse  motion  of  atoms  classically.  In  addition,  the  density  in  the  sample  is 

sufficiently  low  that  we  can  safely  neglect  effects  of  inter-atomic  collisions  for 

interrogation times less than a second.   

To  avoid  altering  the  internal  states  of  the  magnetically  confined  atoms,  we  use 

off-resonant  standing  wave  light  pulses  to  diffract  the  atoms  confined  in  the  magnetic 

guide via the light shift potential. The pulse durations are chosen to be 300nanoseconds, 

which is short enough that the atomic kinetic energy of the 20μK atomic sample can be 

ignored  during  the  pulse  durations.  In  this  so-called  Raman-Nath  region,  single  atoms

τ

  is  defined  as  the  integrated  light  shift  during  the  light  pulse.  In  this 

experiment 

θ  is  chosen  to  be  around  3~4.    The  atom  loss  due  to  each  standing  wave 

pulse is less than 10% of trapped atoms, where the loss is probably due to spontaneous 

emission  and  spin  flips.  The  atom  interferometer  follows  the  3-pulse  Talbot-Lau 

interferometry scheme [17, 18]. In particular, two standing wave pulses at time 0 and T/2 

are applied to diffract atoms to multiple diffraction orders. Diffraction orders that differ 

by 2 photon recoils are expected to interfere around the echo time T to form an atomic 

density grating. This atom density grating has the same spatial periodicity as the standing 

wave  to  be  half  the  light  wavelength.  The  density  grating  can  thus  be  probed  by 

monitoring  the  backscattering  of  one  traveling  laser  to  the  other  direction.  Due  to  the 

quantized  recoil  energy  difference  between  the  diffraction  orders,  the  amplitude  of  the 

atomic density grating is a periodic function of the total interrogation time T, and is given 

by [17, 18]:

Our  experimental  setup  is  an  upgrade  based  on  that  described  in  [11].  We  use  four 

soft  ferromagnetic  ( μ -metal)  foils  (200mm  by  100mm  by  1.5mm),  separated  by 

distances  of  6.35mm,  12.7mm  and  6.35mm,  magnetized  in  alternative  directions  with 

current-carrying wires to generate a 2Dimensional magnetic quadruple field 7 mm away 

from  the  plane  defined  by  four  parallel  edges  of  the  4-foils.  The  4-foil  structure  is 

mounted  on  two  rotation  stages  close  to  a  vacuum  glasscell,  inside  which  laser  cooled 

Rb87 atoms are trapped at the center section of quadruple line (See fig. 2). Aligned along 

the  guide  direction  is  an  off-resonant  standing  wave  field  composed  of  two  nearly 

counter-propagating traveling laser beams, each with 0.9mm 1/e2 beam diameters, which 

will  be  referred  to  as  traveling  light  mode  ETF  and  ETB  in  following  discussions.  The 

standing  wave  is  120  MHz  blue  detuned  to  F=1  –  F’=2  transition  of  Rb87atoms.  In  the 

experiment, around 107 laser-cooled Rb87 atoms are loaded to the magnetic guide with a 

transverse  gradient  of  70Gauss/cm,  end  up  with  a  cylindrically  shaped  trapped  atom 

sample  of  1cm  long  and  150  mμ   wide.  The  atoms  in  the  magnetic  guide  can  be 

precisely  positioned  across  the  standing  wave  region  by  tuning  the  currents  running 

through  the  wires  that  are  wound  around  the  two  inner  foils  (Fig.2).  The  3-pulse 

interferometer  sequence  is  launched  30milliseconds  after  the  atoms  are  loaded  into  the 

magnetic  guide.  The  backscattering  of  ETF  around  the  echo  time  of  the  Talbot-Lau 

interferometer  is  collected  via  an  avalanche  photodiode  through  a  single-mode  fiber 

which is pre-aligned with ETB mode. A weak local field from ETB is frequency shifted and 

beat  against  the  backscattered  light  to  retrieve  its  phase  information  that  reflects  the 

relative  distance  between  the  nodes  of  the  standing  wave  and  the  atom  density  grating. 

The experimental sequence is repeated every 3 seconds.   

Precise  alignment  of  the  magnetic  guide  direction  relative  to  the  standing  wave 

direction is achieved by adjusting the 4-foil structure with two rotation stages to optimize 

the  interferometer  signals  at  large  interrogation  time  T  [19].  In  fig.  3  we  summarize 

typical  readouts  of  the  3-pulse  Talbot-Lau  interferometer  at  different  time  scales.  The 

dispersive-shaped  curve  (fig  3a)  of  the  backscattering  light  amplitude  reflects  the 

self-re-imagine  of  the  density  grating  immediately  after  the  first  pulse  (fig  1),  in 

agreement  with  equation  (1).  The  oscillatory  dependence  of  the  amplitude  of  the 

backscattering  amplitude  (the  interferometer  contrast)  on  the  total  interrogation  time  T 

matches equation (1) nicely (fig3b) if a small imaginary component of the pulse area is 

included  to  account  for  the  atom  loss  [11].  The  long-term  evolution  of  the  contrast 

oscillations  can  be  investigated  by  sampling  the  envelope  of  the  oscillations.  With  the 

direction of the guide and the standing wave aligned to a precision better than quarter a 

milli-radian, the interferometric interrogation time for guided atoms is extended to more 

than 35ms (fig3c)., as compared with 15ms transient time of atoms escape the standing 

wave  region  in  free  space  [20].  The  interferometer  has  a  phase  readout  quadratically 

depends on the interrogation time, This is due to the phase shift of the atomic coherence 

by a 0.8% gravity component along the standing wave and thus the guide direction (fig3d) 

[20].   

The interferometer paths enclose an area, when we shift the atomic sample position 

by  translating  the  waveguide  during  the  three-pulse  interferometer  sequence.  The 

translating  speed  is  limited  by  the  finite  response  time  of  the  4-foil  magnetic  structure, 

and  also  by  the  finite  confining  potential  of  the  magnetic  guide.    We  use  a  guide 

potential  with  a  70G/cm  transverse  gradient.  Depending  on  the  moving  direction,  a 

one-way  linear  ramp  of  currents  around  the  inner  foil  pairs  can  move  atoms  with  a 

uniform velocity of 40 – 60 mm/s without significant heating. The maximum translation 

is limited by the cross section of the standing wave. With our interferometer arrangement, 

we found the 1mm 1/e2 diameter of the standing wave cross section can support a 0.5mm 

translation  distance.  We  prepare  the  atomic  sample  at  one  side  of  the  standing  wave 

region and translate the magnetic guide to the other side, choosing a translating speed of 

v

guide

=18mm/sec so that this 0.5mm distance of translation is completed in 28ms. The 1

st, 

2nd,  and  the  detecting  pulses  of  the  3-pulse  interferometer  are  launched  at  0,  T/2  and 

around  T,  with  T  scanned  from  0  up  to  35ms  in  repeated  experiment.  The  diffraction 

pathways that contribute to the backscattering signal at the interrogation time T enclose 

an  area  of

Fig.4  gives  typically  interferometer  readouts  with  atoms  in  such  moving  guides.  In 

this measurement the atoms are transported vertically (fig 4a) either upward or downward. 

The  standing  wave  intensity  variation  is  about  50%  of  its  maxim  across  the  0.5mm 

atomic  sample  trajectory.  The  phase  (e.g.,  the  position  of  the  standing  wave  nodes) 

variation  of  the  standing  wave  along  the  atom  sample  trajectory  is  estimated  to  be  less 

than 0.2 radiant. The interferometer backscattering signal amplitude as a function of T is 

plotted in fig4a  for both upward and  downward experiment. Compare with the contrast 

decay  data  for  the  stationary  guide  as  shown  in  fig3c,  in  the  moving  guide  case  the 

contrast  decay  is  first  delayed  and  then  accelerated,  as  expected  due  to  the 

time-dependent overlap between the atomic sample and the standing wave. Same as the 

stationary guide case, here the quadratic phase shifts of the interferometer readout are due 

to the 0.8% gravity component along the guide, and are nearly identical for the upward 

and  downward  moving  guide  case.  The  difference  of  the  phase  readouts  from  the  two 

moving guide (fig4c) is due to long term drift of the air-floated optical table that changes 

the tilting angle of the guide relative to gravity. 

In this experiment the interferometer path covers an area of 0.04mm2. With the phase 

resolution  of  0.8  radiant  at  T=28ms,  the  interferometer  can  resolve  rotation  rate  on  the 

order  of  a  milli-Herz  perpendicular  to  the  area.  The  phase  noise  in  our  interferometer 

system  is  largely  due  to  mirror  vibrations,  which  is  verified  by  comparing  (fig.  3d)  the 

noise in the atom interferometer with the time-dependent phase correlations between the 

two  traveling  laser  calculated  with  the  beat  notes  from  an  optical  interferometer  that 

shares the same optics with the atom interferometer system. In addition, unwanted light 

scatterings off the optics degrade the signal to noise ratio of the interferometer at small 

interferometer  contrast  and  thus  the  phase  readout.  The  phase  noise  should  be  greatly 

suppressed with active mirror vibration compensations. The signal to noise ratio can be 

improved by employing “truly white” interferometer schemes such as those using Bragg 

splitting scheme [21] or more recently developed double-pulse interferometer scheme [10, 

22]. 

The area enclosed in the interferometer is limited by the interrogation time, the guide 

moving  speed,  and  in  this  experiment  the  0.5mm  diameter  of  the  standing  wave  field 

cross-section. In this experiment, the 35ms interrogation time is limited by the dephasing 

due  to  inhomogeneity  of  the  magnetic  confining  field  along  the  guide  across  the  1cm 

atomic sample [19]. To overcome this, we need the atomic sample to be colder and more 

localized  along  the  guide.  To  increase  the  transportation  distance,  we  plan  to  use  a 

standing wave field with elliptical cross section that allows the atoms to move along its 

long  axis.  Due  to  the  big  inductance  of  the  magnetic  structures  and  not-so-tight 

confinement,  we  haven’t  been  able  to  move  atoms  in  round  trips  in  between  the  light 

pulses without spreading them out, though we believe it is possible with straightforward 

improvement of the magnetic field control.   

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  a  current-controlled  moving  magnetic  guide 

that transports atoms transversely during a 3 - light pulse atom interferometer sequence 

along the guide. We have found encouraging decoupling of the degree of freedoms for the 

interferometer  and  for  the  transverse  control,  and  achieve  an  interferometer  path  that 

enclose  an  area  of  0.04mm2.  The  demonstrated  guided  atom  interferometer  with 

foreseeable  improvements  may  allow  a  100ms  interrogation  time  with  2cm  translation 

distance.  When  combined  with  multi-photon  beam  splitting  technique  [22],  this  would 

allow  an  interferometer  path  include  an  area  beyond  10mm2.  The  scheme  discussed  in 

this  paper  may  be  developed  to  a  rotation  sensing  device  featured  with  compact 

interference paths and long interrogation time.

Fig. 4 Interferometer signals with atoms in a moving guide. Top: A series of absorption 

images along the magnetic guide that moves up (top) and down (bottom) in 28ms. Two 

dashed arrows along the trajectories of the atomic sample are drawn to guide eyes. . The 

gravity  has  a  0.8%  component  perpendicular  to  the  graph  pointing  inside.  Bottom: 

Interferometer signal with interrogation time T from 0 to 35ms. (a) The Contrast decay 

for the interferometer sequence with atoms in a guide moving up (red) and down (blue). 

(b)  The  upward  and  downward  interferometer  phase  readout.  (c)  The  difference  of  the 

retrieved phases for atoms in the guide moving up and down.

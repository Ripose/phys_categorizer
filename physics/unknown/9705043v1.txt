I.    Introduction

Dr.  Eugene  Podkletnov  reports1,2  an  experiment  wherein  a  rotating,

supercooled Y B a 2Cu 3O 7-x    disk  apparently  acts  as  a  shield  between  the

Earth’s  gravitational  field  and  a  Silicon  Dioxide  sample  suspended  from  the

arm  of  an  electronic  balance.    Sample  weight  changes  are  reported  ranging

from  .05%  to  .3%  depending  on  the  velocity  of  rotation  of  the

superconductor.      During  the  period  of  time  the  weight  effects  were

recorded  the  superconductor  had  a  temperature  range  between  20K  to

70K.    The  superconductor  was  suspended  over  a  toroidal  solenoid  and  was

in  a  state  of  levitation  due  to  the  Meissner  Effect.    A  varying  magnetic  field

was  placed  around  the  superconductor  and  the  frequency  was  varied

between  50  HZ  and  106  HZ.    The  greatest  weight  change  occurred  at  the

1

highest  frequency.    However,  the  weight  reductions  apparently  occurred

even  when  the  rotating  field  was  turned  off  and  the  superconductor

stopped  rotating.      Further  anomalous  weight  behavior  was  reported2  using

Podkletnov’s  experimental  design,  but  with  significant  simplifications.

The  experimental  designs  reported  to  date  have  basically  followed  the

Podkletnov  approach.    That  is    using  a  weight  suspended  over  the  top  of  the

superconductor  (SC),  and  the  weight  being  connected  to  a  balance.    Essentially

we  can  view  the  weight  and  the  SC    as  two  separate  systems.    In  such  an

experimental  arrangement  determining  if  “gravitational  shielding”  is  at  work

as  opposed  to  an  action-reaction  force,  such  as  magnetic  or  electric  fields,  is

very  difficult.    Therefore,  the  experimental  approach  described  herein  creates

a  system  in  which  the  action-reaction  components  cancel  each  other.

The  experimental  question  is  whether  the  Y B a 2Cu 3O 7  SC  material  acts  as  a

gravitational  shield  in  that  mass  situated  above  the  SC  loses  weight  while  the

SC  is  in  the  supercooled  state.    It  must  be  noted  that  very  little  theory

exists 4,5,6,7  that  predicts  a  gravitational  interaction  with  SC’s  at  the  macroscopic

level.    Most  assuredly  no  engineering  formulas  exist  that  aid  in  system  design.

II. 

  Experimental  Design

The  experimental  approach  reported  herein  has  two  phases:

2

Phase  1.      The  determination  of  weight  anomalies  in  a 

system  consisting  of  magnet,  coolant,  SC,  and  target  mass.

Phase  2.    The  determination  of  whether  variations  in  the  target 

mass  produces  a  proportionate  variation  in  system  weight.

Figure  (1)  shows  the  test  model  used  in  phase  1.    It  consists  of  a  50    cc

plastic  prescription  medicine  bottle.    A  rare  earth  Cobalt  disk  magnet

(approximately  .5  Tesla,  Edmund  Scientific  part  number  C52,  867)  is  attached

1.9  cm  below  a  2.54  cm-by-.31  cm    SC  (Edmund  Scientific  part  number  C37,

446)  disk.  The  magnet  is  held  in  place  by  sytrofoam  and  plastic  resin  is  used

as  a  platform  for  the  SC.    A  small  plastic  bead  is  used  to  provide  air  space

between  the  SC  and  the  resin  surface.    The  SC,  bead,  and  resin  platform  are

glued  together.    A  number 2  rubber  stopper  is  glued  to  the  bottle’s  cap  to  act

as  a  target.    This  target  mass  is  approximately  10  grams.      Four  .5  cm  holes  are

drilled  in  the  bottle  just  above  the  top  surface  of  the  SC.    These  holes  allow

liquid  Nitrogen(LN2)  to  enter  and  act  as  the  coolant  during  the  weighing.      The

bottle  plus  magnet,  SC,  target,  and  LN2  will  be  heretofore  designated  as  the

system.    Not  having  any  engineering  guidelines  for  the  construction  of  this  test

model,  the  criticality  of  the  dimensions  provided  are  uncertain.

The  experimental  methodology  is  merely  to  cool  the  SC  to  770K  using  an

LN2  bath.    Some  LN2  enters  the  bottle  through  the  holes.    The  system  is  then

3

placed  on  a  sensitive  digital  electronic  balance.    In  the  case  of  this  experiment

a  Sartorius  Model  1207-MP is  used.    It  has  a  readability  of  .1  mg  and  it

updates  its  reading  every  second.    The  balance  has  glass  sliding  doors  at  the

top  and  both  sides,  so  the  model  can  be  completely  enclosed  for  more  accurate

weighing.    A  six-ounce  styrofoam  cup  separates  the  balance’s  pan  from  the

system.      This  distance  seems  sufficient  to  prevent  the  magnet  from

interacting  with  the  balance’s  electro-mechanics.    However,  balances  are

subject  to  magnetic  influences  and  this  is  an  area  of  noise  that  could  not  be

completely  eliminated  with  certainty.

As  the  system  sits  on  the  balance  the  LN2  is  evaporating  and,  therefore,

mass  is  leaving  the  system  and  the  balance  reads  a  continual  weight  decrease

over  time.    The  balance’s  digital  readout  was  videotaped  during  the  full  span

of  time  that  LN2  is  evaporating  and  beyond  to  assure  that  weights  are

gathered  after  the  SC  warms  passed  its  critical  temperature,  Tc,  of

approximately  900K.      The  video  camera  uses  8mm  tape  and  contains  a  time

and  date  stamp  so  the  time  down  to  1-second  intervals  can  be  recorded  along

with  the  weight  readings.    Tc  can  vary  by  several  degrees  from  one  piece  of

Y B a 2C u 2O 7  to  another.    The  exact    value  of  Tc   was  not  determined  during  the

course  of  these  experiments.      The  LN2  in  the  system  appeared  completely

evaporated  after  about  2  minutes.

4

After  each  weighing  cycle  the  videotaped  readings  are  transcribed  to  an

Microsoft  Excel  Version  5  spreadsheet.      Both  the  time  and  the  corresponding

weight  are  placed  on  the  spreadsheet.    The  graphs  contained  herein  were

generated  using  Excel.    The  raw  data  plots  are  presented  along  with  a  4-point

average  plot.      The  4-point  average  serves  to  smoothe  out  the  low  level  noise,

but  does  not  disguise  the  anomalous  weight  behavior.

The  test  model  in  Figure  (2)  was  used  for  Phase  2  testing.    The  magnet

and  SC  are  the  same  as  in  Phase  1.    The  magnet,  however,  is  glued  directly  to

the  SC,  and  then  this  complex  is  glued  to  the  bottom  of  the  bottle.    A  nylon  bolt

is  attached  to  the  bottle’s  cap.    2.38  cm  X  .31  cm  rubber  washers  are  then

bolted  in  as  required  to  vary  the  weight.    To  add  more  weight  two  brass

washers  are  used  in  place  of  the  washers.    This  arrangement  creates  a  rigid,

but  modifiable  target.

III.  Predicted  Results

In  this  experimental  design,  if  the  SC  acts  as  a  gravitational  shield,  then

the  system  should  display  a  gain  in  weight  as  it  warms  passed  Tc.    This  gain  in

weight  is  expected  because  when  the  test  model  is  placed  on  the  balance,  it  is

already  in  the  supercooled  state  and,  therefore,  shielding  should  be  occurring.

In  essence  the  system  is  lighter  when  it  is  placed  on  the  balanced  and  in

5

theory  we  would  assume  it  would  gain  weight  as  Tc  is  passed.      The  weight  vs.

time  curve  should  show  an  abrupt  slope  change  at  the  point  of  transition  and

then  a  continuation  with  the  previous  slope  characterized  by  evaporating  LN2.

IV.    Phase  1  Results

Four(4)  trials  were  performed  during  phase  1.    Two  trials  were  with  the

SC.    The  third  and  fourth  trials  used  rubber  and  brass  controls  respectively

instead  of  a  SC;  yet,  no  other  features  were  changed  in  the  system.

Trial  1  results  are  shown  in  Figure  (3).    Using  the  gravitational  mass

scale  as  shown  we  can  see  a  high  degree  of  linearity  in  the  evaporation  curve

until  a  sharp  slope  change  occurs  at  around  46  seconds.    This  linearity  is

apparent  down  to  the  centigram  level.    The  sharp  slope  change  is  unusual,  but

can  be  easily  explained  as  being  the  point  in  which  the  LN2  has  completely

evaporated  and  the  balance’s  sampling  rate  is  not  fine  enough  to  catch

transitional  points.

Nothing  particularly  unexpected  appears  in  the  weight  vs.  time  curve.

But,  the  linearity  allows  us  to  perform  some  statistical  analysis  that  could

reveal  effects  to  a  much  lower  level.    First,  we  make  the  assumption  that  Tc

occurs  somewhere  between  0  and  45  seconds.      Second,  we  estimate  the  actual

evaporation  curve  as  given  in  Figure  (3),  by  fitting  a  line  to  the  actual  data.

This  is  done  simply  by  using  the  slope  intercept  formula  with  the  first  weight

6

at  time  0  and  the  second  weight  at  time  45.    The  intercept  is  the  point  with  the

weight  corresponding  to  time  zero(0).

We  know  that  a  curve  in  two  dimensions  can  be  represented  by  the

w(t)  =  l(t)  +  n(t),  where  w  is  weight,  l  is  the  linear  part  of  the

curve,  n  is  the  nonlinear,  and  t  is  time.

following  formula:

Therefore,

n(t)  =  w(t)  -  l(t).

Letting  l(t)  be  the  linear  estimate,  n(t)  represents  the  nonlinear  behavior  of

w(t)  with  respect  to  this  line  of  estimation.    n(t)  measures  the  deviation  of

weight  from  the  linear.    If  l(t)  is  very  close  to  w(t),  then  n(t)  will  display  very

minute  variations  in  the  weight.

n(t)  is  plotted  in  Figure  (4).    Note  the  linearity  is  so  tight  between  l(t)

and  w(t)  that  n(t)’s  scale  ranges  only  20  mg.    We  can  easily  see  effects  at  the

mg  level.      We  can  see  the  obvious  5  mg  increase  in  weight  beginning  at  about

16  seconds.    The  target  mass  weighed  about  10  grams.    Hence,  we  observe  a

.05%  weight  increase.    This  percentage  is  what  Podkletnov  noted  as  the  lower

level  of  observations  he  had  made  in  his  initial  work.1    This  increase  seems  to

evolve  over  a  period  of  about  8  seconds.      Then  a  sharp  decent  occurs  to  the

original  slope  of  the  “pre-event”  curve.

7

    The  same  experiment  was  repeated  in  trial  2  to  see  if  the  results  could

be  replicated.    Figure  (5)  shows  again  the  high  linearity  during  the  first  45

seconds.    Figure  (6)  uses  the  linear  estimation  technique  as  in  trial  1.      Note  the

appearance  of  the  weight  increase  beginning  at  about  25  seconds  and

continuing  to  about  33  seconds,  an  8-second  cycle.    Also,  this  weight  increase

is  again  at  about  the  .05%  level.      The  fact  that  it  occurs  later  in  the  warming

period  is  an  interesting  variation  from  trial  1.      Also,  the  concavity  of  the  chart

is  concave  down,    rather  than  up  as  in  trial  1.

One  of  the  significant  challenges  in  this  experimental  arena  is  finding  the

right  combination  of  controls  to  narrow  the  possible  explanations  for  the

results  seen  in  trials  1  and  2.      Possibly  the  curves  merely  display  the  normal

evaporation  behavior  of  LN2.    Or,  possibly  the  magnet  is  interacting  with  the

balance.    Some  insight  can  be  gained  by  using  a  control  sample  material

instead  of  the  SC.    Hence,  trials  3  and  4  used  rubber  and  brass  respectively.

Figure  (7)  shows  the  evaporation  curve  for  rubber.    Note  the  linearity

again,  so  we  were  immediately  able  to  apply  the  linear  estimate  technique  and

plot  the  results  shown  in  Figure  8.    At  the  same  mg  scale  as  in  previous  trials

no  obvious  and  anomalous  weight  effects  are  observed.

The  experiment  was  repeated  using  a  brass  control  sample  in  trial  4.

The  weight  vs.  time  curve  is  shown  in  Figure  (9).    The  results  here  are  a  bit

8

more  nonlinear.    However,  we  still  applied  the  same  linear  estimation

technique  where  the  results  are  displayed  in  Figure  (10).    Again,  we  see  no

obvious  weight  anomalies.

V.    Phase  2  Results

Recall  that  in  Phase  2  the  test  model  was  redesigned.    The  major  change

was  actually  putting  the  magnet  much  closer  to  the  SC.    This  had  the  effect  of

increasing  the  local  magnetic  field  entering  the  SC  by  a  factor  of  over  1000.

The  Sample  SC  has  a  critical  magnetic  field  much  lower  than  .5  tesla.

Therefore,  the  SC  was  being  over-saturated  by  the  magnetic  field.    The  SC,

therefore,  could  not  achieve  superconductivity.      Over-saturating  the  SC  was

not  intentional  and  it  was  discovered  during  the  Phase  2  experimental

calibrations  and  in  conversations  with  the  SC’s  manufacturer.    The  calibration

performed  was  merely  checking  the  presence  of  the  Meissner  Effect  at  LN2

temperature,  770K.    The  Meissner  Effect  was  never  achieved  with  this

configuration.

However,  the  trials  performed  in  Phase  2  offered  some  interesting  and

surprising  effects.  In  trial  1  of  Phase  2  we  use  a  13  gram  target  weight.      Note

the  subtle  slope  aberration  at  around  17  seconds  in  the  weight  vs.  time  curve,

Figure  (11).  The  slope  decreases  for  a  short  burst  then  continues  on  with  its

previous  slope.      Using  the  linear  estimation,  Figure  (12),  we  see  that  at  the

9

17-second  point  what  might  be  interpreted  as  a  very  subtle  increase  in

weight,  but  this  could  be  merely  judged  as  noise.    Figure  (11)  shows  an

obvious  decrease  in  slope,  which  would  indicate  a  small  increase  in  system

weight.      Of  course,  these  anomalies  could  easily  be  relegated  to  noise  effects.

Figure  (13)  displays  a  bar  chart  of  the  slopes  from  7  seconds  to  27  seconds  of

the  trial  run.    The  slope  is  simply  Weighti  -  Weighti+1.    Note  that  at  17  seconds

the  slope  is  markedly  less  than  all  others  in  the  group.      This  decrease  in  slope

can  be  explained  by  a  system  weight  increase  of  .05%  to  approximately  .1%.

Trial  2  increases  the  target  mass  to  27  grams  using  two  brass  washers.

Figure  (14)  shows  the  weight  vs.  time  curve  and  again  we  see  the  slope

anomaly  appear  at  16  seconds.      The  linear  estimation  curve  is  shown  in  Figure

(15)  and  the  increase  is  clearly  seen  at  the  16-second  point,  representing  a

weight  increase  of  approximately  .05%  to  .1%  of  the  target  weight.    Doubling

the  target  weight  seems  to  produce  a  proportionate  increase  in  system  weight

during  warming.

VI. 

  Analysis  of  the  Experiment

The  experimental  data  to  date  is  very  difficult  to  interpret.      To  assume

that  gravitational  effects  are  at  work  is  premature.    Other  possibilities  exist

and  will  be  discussed  below.

10

1.    Thermal  conductivity  changes 

in  the  superconductor.    If  the

thermal  conductivity  of  the  superconductor  changes  around  the  critical

temperature,  then  we  would  see  changes  in  the  LN2  evaporation  rate,  which

could  account  for  some  of  the  observed  results.    However,  these  effects  could

be  ruled  out  because  the  thermal  conductivity  of  this  particular  type  of  SC

actually  begins  to  increase  at  Tc,  and  peaks  at  about  500 K. 5      The  increase  is

small  from  approximately  3.5    to  4.0  watts/meter/  K  degree.    The  conductivity

is  very  flat  up  to  around  1500K.      So,  the  smallness  of  the  change  in  thermal

conductivity  is  not  expected  to  produce  the  observed  results.    Yet,  even  more

is  the  fact  that  the  thermal  conductivity  increases.    This  would  cause  the

evaporation  rate  to  increase,  not  decrease.    Therefore,  such  a  change  in

thermal  conductivity  would  be  observed  as  a  decrease  in  system  weight,  not

an  increase.

2.    External  magnetic  fields.    Such  fields  are  the  most  viable  candidates  for

the  observed  results  and  the  most  difficult  to  rule  out.    The  experimental

surroundings  were  not  shielded  against  electromagnetic  fields.      The  fact  that

the  rubber  and  brass  trials  showed  none  of  the  effects  observed  with  the  SC

trials,  indicates  that  the  magnet  attached  to  the  system  did  not  contribute  by

itself  to  the  anomalous  effects.    However,  the  controls  do  not  rule  out  magnetic

effects  brought  on  by  the  superconducting  material,  even  though  the  SC  does

11

not  achieve  superconductivity  in  Phase  2.    The  observation  that  the  proportion

of  weight  increase  remains  constant  even  as  the  target  weight  is  doubled  also

indirectly  diminishes  the  external  magnetic  field  possibility,  and  contributes

some  validity  to  a  gravitational  shielding  explanation.    However,  further

testing  is  necessary  to  rule  out  external  field  influences.

3.    Effects  within  the  Electronic  Balance.    These  effects  are  good

candidates  and  must  be  ruled  out  by  repeating  the  experiment  using  other

equipment.      The  assumption  in  these  experiments  is  that  effects  within  the

balance  would  occur  at  random  points  and  would  not  occur  in  the  same  places

or  in  the  same  way  during  successive  trials.    Therefore,  balance  effects  would

not  explain  the  repeatable  results  obtained  in  these  experiments.

4.    Random  Noise.    We  can  quickly  rule  out  random  effects  because  of  the

fact  that  the  experimental  behavior  showed  consistent  and  similar  results

during  each  trial  execution.

5.    Atmospheric  effects.    Because  LN2  is  evaporating  inside  the  closed

balance  chamber,  significant  thermal  effects  are  occurring.    Convection

currents  would  be  prevalent  and  the  balance  may  be  effected  by  the

temperature  changes.    The  assumption  in  these  experiments  is  that

atmospheric  effects  would  behave  in  a  random  manner  and  would  show  up

12

differently  during  the  experimental  replications.    However,  ideally  this

experiment  could  be  greatly  improved  by  performing  it  in  a  vacuum.

6 .    Rapid  condensation  of  water  vapor.    These  effects  are  assumed  to

behave  randomly.

VI.  Hypothesis

To  provide  a  hypothesis  as  to  the  cause  of  these  observed  phenomena  is

tempting.    The  effects  seen  by  varying  the  target  mass  appears  to  point  to  a

gravitational  connection.    However,  the  fact  that  in  the  experiment

superconduction  was  prevented  by  an  over-saturating  magnetic  field  would

lead  one  to  guess  that  the  material  displays  some  temperature  dependent

critical  points  in  its  own  gravitational  interaction,  which  are  possibly

independent  of  the  electronic  effects  causing  superconduction.    The  critical

temperature  for  the  gravitational  interaction  may  be  somewhat  different  than

that  of  superconduction.      No  viable  theory  at  presents  explains  or  predicts  the

phenomena  observed  in  these  experiments.    Obviously  a  great  deal  more  work

is  required  with  rigorous  examination  and  replication  within  the  scientific

community.

Since  these  effects  were  observed  at  the  macroscopic  level,  a  useful

endeavor  might  be  to  describe  the  phenomena  using  a  Newtonian  perspective.

13

Minimally  we  observed  in  these  experiments  a  weight  anomaly  at  the  .05%

level.    Let

Force  =  GM1M target/R2

where  G  =  6.67  x  10-11  nt-m2/kg 2,

M 1  =  mass  of  the  Earth  at  5.98  x  1024k g ,

R  =  the  radius  of  the  Earth  at  6.37  x  106  meters,

M target  =  the  mass  of  the  experimental  target,  .01  kg  for 

the  first  set  of  trials.

G M 1/R 2  =  9.86  using  the  values  provided.

Hence,  the  force  between  the  target  mass  and  the  earth  is

9.86  x  .01  =  .0986  nts.

The  anomaly  appeared  as  a  decrease  in  weight  of  .05%,  or  4.93  x  10-5  nts.9    The

question  now  arises  regarding  what  is  really  changing  to  produce  the  weight

anomaly:    target  mass,  Earth  mass,  the  gravitational  field,  or  some  other

parameter(s).    To  assume  that  the  masses  have  changed  would  immediately

open  additional  questions  regarding  whether  inertial  mass  changed  equally.    Is

the  Principle  of  Equivalence  violated?    Another  perspective  would  be  to

assume  that  the  gravitational  field  is  altered  locally  above  the  SC  and  the

masses  are  left  unchanged.    This  would  imply  the  gravitational  constant  G

changes  at  some  point  around  the  SC’s  critical  temperature.

14

G  has  dimension  Length(L)3/(Mass(M)  x  Time(T)2).    If  we  assume  that

mass  does  not  change,  then  we  are  left  with  length  and/or  time.    For  simplicity

sake,  assume  that  time  does  not  change.    Therefore,  we  can  argue  that  if  the

field  constant  G  changes  it  is  a  result  of  a  change  in  length  measure.    Or,  we

can  establish  a  very  restricted  form  of  relativity  within  the  domain  of

superconductivity.

Since  all  variables.  except  length,  are  considered  invariant  under  a

transformation  that  occurs  at  the  SC’s  critical  temperature(Tc),  we  can

immediately  write  a  relation  between  reference  frames  above  and  below  Tc.

L’/L    =    (F’/F)1/3,  where  L’  and  F’  are  the  length 

and  force  measures  as  observed  below  Tc.

In  the  case  of  trial  1  with  a  10  gram  target  mass,  F’/F  =  .999995.    Therefore,

L’/L  =  .999998.    Or,  L’  =  .999998L.

We  can  use  the  information  determined  above  as  a  form  of  boundary

condition  in  determining  a  metric  transformation  equation.    The  behavior  of

the  weight  in  these  experiments  can  be  described  as  shown  in  Figure  (16).

Note  the  step  near  the  critical  temperature  of  approximately  900K.    We

know  that  superconducting  materials  behave  electrically  as  shown  in  the

figure  in  that  electrical  resistance  also  drops  to  zero  as  a  step.    The  following

equation  is  a  good  representation  of  the  experimental  behavior:

15

( 1 )

L’  =  L  (1  +  ße(1  -  Tn/T c

n))- 1

where  T  is  the  temperature  in  degrees  Kelvin.    Tc  is  the  critical  temperature.    ß

is  the  appropriate  scale  factor  determined  by  boundary  conditions.    n  is  a  real

number  that  is  determined  by  the  bandwidth  around  Tc.    n  and  ß  need  to  be

determined  experimentally  because  they  seem  to  be  material  dependent.    In

Figure  (16)  for  this  discussion  we  let  ß  =  .999998,  Tc =  90K,  and  n  =  10.    n  does

not  need  to  be  a  whole  number.

Using  Equation  (1)  we  can  begin  asking  questions  similar  to  those  related

to  Special  Relativity.    What  do  observers  in  one  reference  frame  see  happening

to  events  occurring  in    another  reference  frame?    In  the  case  of  these

experiments  we  are  speculating  that  the  reference  frames  are  related  as  a

function  of  temperature,  such  as  Equation  (1).    The  laws  of  physics  transform

invariantly  because  Equation  (1)  merely  behaves  as  a  constant  in  derivatives

of  L  and  L’  with  respect  to  time.    The  distance  metric  also  preserves  its  form,

so  Maxwell’s  Equations  and  General  Relativity  transform  invariantly.      The

conclusion  of  this  speculation  is  the  observers  in  the  above-Tc  frame  will  see

measured  differences  in  physical  phenomena,  such  as  weight,  occurring  in  the

below-T c  frame.

  Conclusions

A  great  deal  more  work  is  required  to  determine  the  validity  of  this

anomalous  weight  behavior.    The  observed  effects  in  this  report  and  in  others

have  been  very  small,  but  definitely  on  the  macroscopic  level  and  they  are

detectable  with  simple  apparatus.    Most  high  school  laboratories  could  repeat

the  experiments  described  in  this  report.      Replication  of  the  experiment

described  in  these  pages  is  encouraged,  but  the  following  avenues  of  research

also  need  further  investigation:

•    Test  the  effect  of  cascading  magnets  and  SC’s  above

one  another.    Would  this  increase  the  anomalous  effects?

•    Different  configurations  of  magnetic  fields,  both  static

and  varying  need  to  be  examined.

•    Different  types  of  SC  materials  need  to  be  tested,  such  as

Bismuth  compounds  and  other  varieties  of  high  temperature

SC’s.    Not  all  SC  materials  may  behave  as  the  one  in  these

experiments.

•    Further  tests  need  to  be  made  using  increasing  target  mass.

  Acknowledgments

In  doing  this  series  of  experiments  I  received  great  encouragement  from

four  people  from  around  the  world.    Mr.  John  Schnurer  provided  many

insights  into  the  behavior  of  the  materials  and  has  helped  analyze  the  results

to  date.    He  also  has  observed  this  puzzling  behavior  through  his  own

laboratory  efforts.    Dr.  Giovanni  Modanese  has  not  only  been  encouraging  and

has  helped  me  calibrate  what  possible  theoretical  basis  exists  for  the  observed

behavior.    I  appreciate  the  help  that  Dr.  David  Noever  has  provided  me  during

these  difficult  experimental  trials.    He  has  been  willing  and  interested  in

looking  at  the  results  and  helping  with  trying    to  narrow  the  various  reasons

for  the  anomalies.    I  am  extremely  grateful  to  Michael  Adamson  from  NASA

Ames  Research  Center  for  helping  me  with  the  laboratory  equipment.    He  was

very  cooperative  during  the  strange  hours  of  these  experiments.    Lastly,  I

appreciate  the  comments  received  from  Phillip  Carpenter  of  the  Department  of

Energy,  Oak  Ridge  Operations  relative  to  the  experiment  and  this  report.

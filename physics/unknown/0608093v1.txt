Abstract:  Dynamic  phase  microscopy  has  been  applied  for  measurements 
of nanometer-scale displacements of a piezoelectric scanner. This scanner, 
which was designed for calibration purposes for scanning probe microscopy 
and TEM, exhibited a linear and hysteresis-free translation in the 0.05 – 20 
nm  range.  The  voltage-activated  motion  is  described  by  a  coefficient  of 
0.03±0.005 nm/V.

1. Introduction 
 
Developments in nanotechnology are largely relying on characterization techniques such 
as TEM and scanning probe microscopy, which enable measurements at the nanometer scale. 
Atomic  force  microscopy  (AFM)  is  the  leading  scanning  probe  technique  and  it  is  widely 
applied for real time visualization of nanostructures and various dynamic processes at small 
scales  [1].  Piezoelectric  actuators,  which  are  used  in  AFM,  are  made  of  polycrystalline 
materials  and  possess  a  number  of  imperfections  (hysteresis,  non-linearity,  etc)  limiting 
accuracy  of  their  translation  [2].  At  present,  open  loop  scanners  of  scanning  probe 
microscopes are calibrated at scales above 100 nm with different gratings and at the atomic-
scale with crystalline samples like mica (spacing 0.52 nm) or graphite (spacing of 0.25 nm).   

The calibration data are used for software that corrects the actual motion of the scanners 
during imaging.  In close loop scanners their actual displacement is measured independently 
and used for correction of the scanner motion.  Yet the close loop scanners are noisier than the 
open  loop  ones  and  less  useful  for  imaging  of  surfaces  with  resolution  down  to  1  nm.  

Therefore,  high-resolution  AFM  imaging  is  performed  with  the  open  loop  scanners  that 
require calibration means in the 1 – 100 nm range. 

One of the possible solutions for the calibration of AFM scanners and TEM microscopes 
is  the  use  of  linear  hysteresis-free  piezoelectric  actuators  based  on  single  crystals  [3].  The 
control  of  the  motion  of  such  actuators  can  be  performed  with  dynamic  phase  microscopy 
method  and  this  procedure  is  described  in  the  paper.  Once  calibrated  this  actuator  can  be  a 
useful tool in microscopy labs. It also can be considered as a scanner in two-scanner systems, 
where imaging of high-resolution is performed with a small scan actuator and visualization of 
larger structures with an actuator based on polycrystalline material.   

There  is  another  important  issue  to  address is  providing  a  nanotechnology  science  with 
metrological  devices,  namely  static  dimensions  standards  and  dynamic  standards  for  lateral 
displacement  measurements.  The  conventional  static  standards  like  diffraction  lattices  have 
the hindrances either in manufacturing process of the regular structures, and in keeping of the 
parameters of these structures safe out of vacuum and cleaning rooms. At ambient conditions, 
even the finest filters being applied the surface is covered with adsorbed layer or with the tiny 
dust particles of submicron size as well, which capable to destroy measurement accuracy. To 
clean a specimen surface it is necessary to use special technological processes, for instance ion 
purification, which in turn can lead to surface deformation.  

The  implementation  of  dynamic  standards [4]  is a  unique  possibility  to solve  the  issues 
mentioned above. In this case a displacement of a surface investigated is carried out by driven 
voltage in an ambient equilibrium conditions without additional safety expenses. Moreover, in 
contrast to regular measure devices based on silicon surface’s structures the dynamic etalons 
capable  to  provide translational  movements not  only  at  nanometer but  at  picometer  scale  as 
well.  However,  a  real-time  registration  and  precise  measurement  of  such  small-scale 
translations by optical methods are not possible for Legal Metrology Services by now. Yet, it 
becomes possible due to unique properties of phase imaging and multiple super resolution [5] 
when dynamic phase microscopy (DPM) method [6-8] is applied.  

For  the  first time the  certifications  results  of  dynamic  standard  “Nanotester” [4] at  sub-
nanometer scale by new nontraditional method are presented in this article. The purposes of 
the “Nanotester” standard measurements given below are to highlight the capabilities of new 
dynamic phase microscopy method, hysteresis absence evidence, and to show the transmission 
constant measurement procedure. The fundamental application fields of “Nanotester” due to 
high accuracy of measurements at sub-nanometer scale are broad: scanning probe and electron 
microscopy, 
nanooptics, 
nanomechanics.  It  can  be  successfully  applied  for  testing  the  dynamic  characteristics  of  the 
probe stabilizing systems and interferometers.

2. Nanotester and its calibration 
 
"Nanotester" cell (Fig. 1) is designed to generate vertical or horizontal displacements in 
the 0-20 nm and 0-60 nm ranges, respectively. These are the motions of a surface of a central 
block carrying a piezoelectric crystal in the horizontal and vertical cells. An electronic block 
(not shown) supplied voltage (±1 kV) to the cells to cause the crystal motion. These cells are 
λ
 
calibrated with a coherent phase microscope “Airyscan” [7, 8] with the helium - neon laser (
=  632,8  nm)  as  a  source  in  a  setup  described  in  Fig.  2.  An  optical-path  difference  was 
measured  using  modulation  method  with  position-sensible  photodetector  –  dissector  image 
tube.  In  static  images  the  microscope  provided  sensitivity  about  0.5  nm  and  a  spatial 
resolution up to 100 nm. Sampling rate was limited with modulation frequency 1 kHz (or 1 
ms/pixel). The software allowed carrying out the statistical analysis of space-time processes. 

This instrument is used for dynamic phase measurements in which 3D surface pattern is 
represented  by  a  function  h(X,Y,t),  where  h  –  optical  path  difference  measured  by  the 
interferometer  and  X,Y  –  surface  coordinates.  Most  of  the  calibration  operations  for 

displacements  in  the  nanometer  range  require  low  electric  and  vibration  noise  environment 
and high temperature stability eliminating thermal drift.

difference  are  carried  out  by  compensational  method  in  each  point  consistently  scanning 
images. Optical-path difference values normalized on the wavelength are collected in computer 
memory. 

 

 
3. Displacements in the 1 nm - 60 nm range 
  
Small lateral motions of the crystal of “Nanotester” are registered as a shift of a surface 
reference feature. It can be also done by measurements of vertical displacement of a structure 
with height gradient.  In this case a lateral motion will cause a known change of height at the 
reference  location.  The  structures  of  steep  slopes  are  desirable  for  more  accurate 
measurements.

with  micro  defect  and  scan-line  Y  –  const  along  which  the  phase  height  profile  were 
periodically (30 ms) measured. b - Two shifted phase height of micro defect. c - track-chart 
(sequence  of  the  phase  height  profiles)  with  periodic  commutations  of  the  voltage  with 
decreasing amplitude. The trace of the track-chart section by horizontal plane (light contour 
line) shows alteration of shift in course of voltage manipulation. 

 
A  2D  phase  image  of  a  defect  is  shown  in  Fig.  3a  and  “scan-line”  Y  =  const  position, 
along which phase height profiles h(X,Y) and h(X+ Δ X,Y) and profile difference  Δ h(X) were 
defined in image section. Fig. 3b shows two profiles with gradient S = 0.5, where their shift 
Δ X  from  the  voltage  is  noticeable.  Alterations  of  local  height  h(X,t)  as the applied  voltage 
changed from 545V to 51V is demonstrated by a series of profiles. Light contour line (see Fig. 
3c) shows lateral time shift of the point position fixed on the level of maximum gradient of the 
profile.  Minimal  quasi-static  lateral  shifts  measured  by  these  methods  were  limited  by  their 
intrinsic noise level and were of 1nm.   

 
4. Displacements below 1 nm 

 

Displacements  in  pico-meter  range  were  recorded  with  a  modulation  technique.  The 
response  of  the  piezoelectric  crystal  to  sine  wave  voltage  with  fixed  amplitude  U  and 
frequency  f  was  collected  during  3  minutes.  Fourier  analysis  of  the  response  at  fixed  phase 
level provides spectral density distribution of the shift ρ(f,U) and frequency f = 1 Hz. (Linear 
interpolation has been used for a reduction of a digitization step to 0.1 nm.)  The displacement 
Δ X was determined from the following equation:

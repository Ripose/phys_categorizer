The  vacuum  field  theory  is  the  conventional  denomination  of  a  new  field  theory  based  on  two  axioms  concerning  two 
 
basic  states  of  vacuum.  According  to  the  first  one,  which  will  be  applied  in  kinematics,  dynamics  and  electrodynamics,  when 
neither gravitational, electromagnetic nor other fields are acting, vacuum in a confined domain of  space round the connected to 
the same vacuum inertial reference frame and in the scope of a given inertial reference frame, is in an inactivated state. This state 
is characterized in both cases with isotropic propagation of light at a constant speed . On the basis of the first axiom and the 
presumption that the physical phenomena in the macrouniverse are space and time defined, using the conventional definitions of 
the  measurement  operations  in  the  inertial  reference  frames,  moving  relative  to  each  other,  the  simultaneity  of  events  in  these 
frames has been proved. A model based on the experiments is proposed to present the interaction between vacuum and the material 
bodies.  It  entails  that  they  do  not  change  their  dimensions  due  to  their  inertial  motion  in  relation  to  vacuum  or  other  material 
bodies, i. e. it is concluded that the space is a Newtonean space. The transformation of the coordinates, the  relative velocities  and 
′K  moving relative to 
the time during the transition from the vacuum connected reference frame 
the  first  one  and  the  opposite  transition  are  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  above  model  and  the  axiom.  Based  on  the  axiom 
concerning the inactivated state of the vacuum, the same transformation are valid for the motion of the inertial reference  frame 
′′K  in the proper space of frame 
′K . The 
transformation,  mentioned  above,  are  used  to  formulate  the  law  of  velocity  summation  and  to  derive  the  formulas  of  the  four-
dimensional vector, velocity and acceleration. The law of velocity summation was used to investigate the propagation of light in an 
optically  denser  moving  environments  and,  as  a  result,  the  formula  of  Fizeau  was  derived.  The  famous  Thomas  formula  of 
precession has been obtained. It has been shown that the proper time in the inertial reference frame

reference  frames  in  the  macrouniverse,  we  shall  deal  with  measuring  the  real  deformations  if  they  actually  exist.  The  indirect 
methods  of  measuring  the  refraction  index  of  a  moving  body,  used  in  the  experiments  of  Rayleigh  [1]  and  Brace  [2]  did  not 
establish the existence of real deformations. The experiments of Trouton and Rankine [3], measuring the electrical resistance of a 
moving conductor, and those of Wood, Tomlison, and Essex [4], measuring the frequency of an oscillating quartz rod, have come 
to the same conclusion.

For the above-mentioned model the density of 

 particles is presumed to be the same in the space volume of frame 

  
With the vacuum model which will be used we shall assume that when the bodies move  in  vacuum,  it  influences  them.  
Its influence is equivalent to that of material particles  m  much smaller than the atom. They will not influence an inertial reference 
frame only  if  their average  velocity relat  to the frame equals zero. This  frame  will  be  called  a proper reference  frame  of  the 
vacuum in the space domain discussed and will be denoted by frame 
′K  
 
′K  relative to frame  K 
and their average velocity relative to the same frame to be equal to zero. As a result of the motion of frame 
 particles in the first frame will be considered higher than their density in the second one. These assumptions 
the density of 
′K  will propagate isotropically and with a constant 
make it obvious, that the propagation of light in the proper space of frame 
speed. Another consequence for the above-mentioned model is that if some deformations appear as a result of the bigger density of 
′K   as  a  macrobody,  they  will  be  identical  in  all  the  directions  because  of  the  same  density  of  the  m

′K  physical processes in it will be delayed and time in it will go 
 
slower  than  in    frame K .  This  enables  us  to  determine  the  speed  of    frame 
′K   relative    to  the  inactivated  state  of  vacuum  in   
a  restricted spatial domain. This is carried out by defining in which proper inertial frame  K  time  goes  faster compared   to  any  
other inertial reference frame 

′K , irrespective of the magnitude and the direction of its velocity relative to frame  K .

7.  Thomas precession 

As is known (see [5]), if certain frame 

 
time of an random vector 

r
G  in this frame will satisfy the equation 

 
′K  rotates relative to the origin 

O

 of frame 

K , the velocity of the change with 

−
where  rωT  is the angular velocity of rotation, obtained by Thomas. 
 
If a material body is moving along a trajectory of a rosette type there will be a precession of the perihelia and the velocity 
of  the  body  on  passing,  will  always  be  perpendicular  to  the  perihelia.  The  direct  result  is  that  the  “precession”  of  the  velocity 
equals to the precession of the perihelia.

In Sec. 5.1 from [10] it is proved that with a properly chosen interval of time  ∆t  relative to frame  K , the passing of time 
 
in an accelerated reference frame can be assumed with the necessary research accuracy to be identical to the passing  of time in the 
same  interval  in  an  inertial  reference  frame.  That  appeared  to  be  possible  if  at  the  beginning  of  the  interval  ∆ t ,  the  speeds  of 
accelerated  and  inertial  reference  frames  are  identical  relative  to  frame  K .  It  can  be  easily  seen,  that  the  identical  conditions 
mentioned  at  the  beginning  of  the  interval 
  are  valid  also    at  any  circular  movement  with  a  constant  linear  speed  v  of  the 
P  compared to its free movement with velocity v. Such a phenomenon  has been experimentally established in [9]. 
material point 
According to the experimental results, obtained there, the rate of decay of a muon, freely moving  along a circular orbit with a linear 
speed v in a strong magnetic field coincides with the rate of decay of the freely moving with  the same speed muon with accuracy to 
2%. This fact indicates, that at accelerations of frame  K ′  relative to frame  K ,  which  do not destroy frame  K ′ , the last one of the 
formulas (10) retains its form. 
 
vector  rωT  is perpendicular to the same plane. For this purpose in the above equation we put

Fizeau [6] was the first to test this formula experimentally by observing the displacement of the interference picture when 

 
the propagation of light is accomplished in a tube full of quickly running water. Later Michelson and Morley [7] tested it as well.

In  kinematics  of  the  vacuum  field  theory  we  proved  the  invariance  of  the  proper  time  in  the  inertial  reference  frame 
 
′K .This is used in dynamics of the vacuum field theory to find a Langrangian of the free particle, coinciding with that in special 
relativity.  This  and  the  usage  of  the  familiar  methods  proved  that  the  formulas  in  special  relativity  are  valid  for  the  dynamic 
quantities – mass, force, momentum and energy. The investigations showed that the effective cross-section is an invariant and the 
formulas  of  particle  decay  are  the  same  as  those  in  special  relativity.  The  formulas  of  the  four-dimensional  mode  of  force  and 
impulse  are  derived  using  the  formulas  of  the  four-dimensional  vector,  obtained  in  kinematics  of  the  vacuum  field  theory.  The 
elastic collision of two particles was investigated in the general case. The difference registered between the formulas, concerning 
the elastic collision of two particles in the laboratory system and the center of  mass system in special relativity for the particular 
case,  in  which  one  of  the  particles  is  immovable,  was  a  result  of  the  fact,  that  in  accordance  with  the  vacuum  field  theory,  the 
treatment of the case relative to the center of mass system is devoid of physical sense. The investigation of Compton effect resulted 
in the well-known formula. 
 
′K . The Langrangian of the 
 
free particle identical with the one in special relativity was obtained taking into account the invariance in the method, presented in 
[2]. After this and the use of the methods, presented in [2], we obtain, that the formulas of special relativity will be valid for  mass, 
force, momentum, energy, as well particle decay is found to be uniform with the one  from special relativity. 
  

The vacuum field theory [1] proved the invariance of proper time in inertial reference frame

and  the  derivative  −

  is  the  energy  of  particle E .  The  (51)  and  (52)  formulas,  presenting  the  four-dimensional

 actually coincide with those of  momentum

The comparison of the latter formulas to the formulas, denoted by (45) and presented in [1], shows that momentum and 
energy  are  components  of  a  four-dimensional  radius  vector.  So  the  formulas  (46),  presented  in  [1]  and  concerning  the 
transformation of the four-dimensional vector in the transition from one coordinate system to another, will be valid. Then

          2. Theory of the elastic collision between two particles in the general case 

                 In 1914 Jüttner [3] developed the general case of the theory of the elastic collision between two particles in laboratory 
system in accordance with special relativity. Two basic methods are used in the treatment of particular cases of elastic collision 
between  two  particles  in  special  relativity  when  one  of  them  is  supposed  to  be  immovable  in  laboratory  system.  The  method, 
presented in [2], Sec. 13, first investigates the impact  relative to the center of mass system. Then, using the formulas of momentum 
and energy transformations in the transition from the center of mass system to laboratory system, the values of the parameters in 
the  second  system  are  obtained.  The  second  method  investigates  the  collision  relative  to  laboratory  system,  treating  the  three 
separate cases, discussed in [3], [2], Sec. 13, [4] and [5]. Based on the vacuum field theory this work presents a theory of the elastic 
collision between two particles in laboratory system for the general case that differs from the theory of Jüttner. This theory makes 
it possible to obtain the above-mentioned particular cases as done in [6].

Let us consider a particular case in special relativity when one of the particles is immovable in laboratory system again. It 
 
is  possible  initially  to  treat  the  elastic  collision  in  the  center  of  mass  system  and  then  using  the  familiar  transformations  of 
momentum and energies of the particles in the transition from the center of mass system to laboratory system to find the parameters 
of their motion in the latter system. This case is discussed in [2] p. 49 and the following formulas for the energies of the particles 
after their collision in laboratory system are obtained

The investigation shows that the analytical form of the latter two formulas cannot be reduced to these formulas from the 
 
 
corresponding particular case from the discussed general case in Sec. 2.7  by [6]. The only exception is in the case of ι
. In 
this case, taking into account the  minus in front of the square root of formula (2.109) from [6], the two methods give the same 
analytical expressions for

The conclusion is that in special relativity when applying the latter two methods, there is not any simple definition of the 
connection between the physical quantities. The investigations proved that the differences between the two methods increase with 
the  increase of  the  velocity  of  the first body,  before  the  collision,  to values  comparable  to  the velocity  of  light.  For  example,  if

  obtained,  using  the  second  method  is  smaller  by  17,0%  than  the  one 

calculated using the first method. At the same values of ratio of masses, 

10V

 and 

1 ι  the value for 

2E ′

 using the second method is 

greater  by  47,0%  than  the one obtained  using  the first  method. This  difficulty  in  special  relativity  is  surmounted  in  the  vacuum 
field theory, on the grounds of which only the first method is true. In accordance with the vacuum field theory the second method 
is devoid of physical sense due to the fact that the energies and the momentum of the particles are determined only relative to the 
proper space domain of the experimental installation and not related with the proper space of the center of mass system because it 
does not possess one. The mistakes with the second method are also due to the space indeterminacy of the phenomena discussed 
and, in the particular case, instead of formula (33) in the vacuum field theory the formula  tg
 

is used.

4. Compton effect 
 
 
The  quantum  theory  considers  the  light  wave  as  a  flux  of  light  quanta  –  photons.  The  Compton  effect  is  treated  as  an 
elastic collision of two particles - the photon moving with the speed  of  light  and the immovable in laboratory system electron 
whose mass is 
. Assuming that the direction of the distribution of the light wave coincides with the positive direction of the axis

5. Invariance of the effective cross-section   
 
Let us consider the collision of a beam of particle with density  n  (i.e. the number of particles in a volume unit) with the 
K , with density  n .Let us assume that the beam particles are  immovable relative

particles of a target, immovable relative to frame
to frame
 

′K , which moves relative to frame K  in the standard way with speed v. 
As is known, the number of collisions  dν in the elementary volume  dV  of frame  K is

where the coefficient σ  is the effective cross section in frame  K .

In their essence the number of collision  dν is an invariant value. The space in the vacuum field theory is a Newtonean 

where all the prime quantities are relative to frame 
 
space, so the volumes are invariant as well. This is valid both for the unit and the elementary volumes. Consequently,

this  in  the  vacuum  field  theory,  the  transformations  of  the  coordinates,  of  time  and  relative  velocities  of  the  above-mentioned 
transition are used. The two new functions introduced are the same as in special relativity. The consideration of Doppler effect in 
the vacuum field theory results in the derivation of its well-known formula in the relative case. The real and observed aberrations, 
as well the reflection from a moving mirror are investigated. As a result, the formulas for them as well as the change of amplitude 
of  the  electromagnetic  wave  were  derived.  The  differences  between  these  formulas  and  the  corresponding  relative  formulas, 
occurring  in  some  cases,  appear  to  be  insignificant  and  experimentally  unobservable.  The  well-known  formula  from  the 
experiment, carried out to determine the light pressure, was obtained in the process of its consideration in the vacuum field theory. 
′′K  in the proper space of the inertial reference 
The question concerning  the velocity of motion of the inertial reference frame

′K ,  in  case  its  mass  and  dimensions  are  much  smaller  than  those  of 
frame 
grounds of the results obtained an experimental check can be accomplished nowadays.

theory becomes a proven fact.

4.  Observable aberration 

The term observable aberration is used to denote the deviation of light due to its transition from the proper space  V  of 

k

k ′

K  to the proper space  V  of frame 

′K  or the reverse transition. In the first of the two cases after the light is emitted in 
frame 
frame  K   at  a  certain  angle,  the  change  in  its  direction  can  be  registered  by  an  observer,  positioned  in  the  proper  space  V   of 
′K .  On  those  grounds,  the  aberration  can  be  called  observable.  Let  us  consider  the  first  case,  in  which  we  assume  that 
frame 
O X Y  is a plane of symmetry for  V  and plane
O Y Z  
′

will be considered a proper space of frame  K , in which the speed of light, measured in frame  K  equals 
 
A light beam is emanated towards frame

relative to frame 
Vk ′
that satisfies the formula below: 

′K  relative to frame K . 
′K  from  the  origin  O  of frame  K  at a sharp angle ϑ   to axis   OX ,  propagating in 
O X Y . The propagation  speed of the light beam relative to frame  K  is 
, and 
 can be calculated using the last of (34) formulas. After passing in the proper space 

′K , the speed of the beam becomes equal to  c  and, as a result, it is refracted by the boundary plane at an angleϑ  ′  

Let us assume that the stipulations, accepted for Doppler effect are valid for the motion of frame

 coincides with plane

This formula for the aberration coincides with the one deduced in special relativity and presented in [4]. 

5.  Reflection from a moving mirror 

Let  us  investigate  the  reflection  of  a  plane  electromagnetic  wave  from  a  moving  mirror  when  the  ideal  mirror  surface 
′K   and  the  falling  and  reflected  wave  are  in  the  proper  space  of 

The  first  case  to  be  discussed  is  the  case  when  the  mirror  is  immovable  relative  to  frame

 
coincides  with  the  boundary  of  the  proper  space  of  frame 
frame K . The movement of frame 
 
O X Y while the trajectory of the light beam is in plane
coincides with plane

This  indicates  that  the  reflection  law  in  the  case  discussed  does  not  differ  from  the  reflection  law  for  the  immovable 
 
mirror.  This  discussion  makes  it  clear  that,  in  the  case  of  reflection  only,  the  velocity  component  of  the  mirror,  parallel  to  the

7.  Electrodynamics  methods  used  to  determine  the  velocity  of  an  inertial  reference  frame  relative  to  the  proper 
reference frame of  vacuum 

As  is  known,  Doppler  effect  makes  it  possible  to  measure  the  velocity  of  the  motion  of  the  source  of  electromagnetic 

 
waves and it can be used to determine the velocity of frame 
 

′K  relative to frame  K . 

Let us present another method that makes it possible to experiment in frame 

′K  itself in order to determine its velocity 

relative to frame  K . The ratio 

 in frame  K  satisfies the second of (2.49) formulas from [6]. In frame 

′K  moving with speed 

 

 

 of the immovable electron in it will be equal to the mass  m  of the electron moving with speed 

e

v  relati to frame  K , the mass 
v  relative to frame  K , i.e.

Then, in case the electron is moving in the proper space of frame 
(2.49) formulas from [6] in frame  K , the following result will be obtained

Besides the problems discussed it is of interest to check the fidelity of the vacuum field theory using the experiments on 
the theoretically-grounded possibility to reach a speed higher than the speed of light  c  relative to frame  K  proposed in [6].  This 
′K  and the direction of its propagation coincides with 
proved to be possible in the case when light propagates in vacuum of frame

The theory of gravitation in the vacuum field theory assumes that the axiom of the activated state of vacuum is valid for 
  from  the 
the  gravitational  interaction  of  material  points.  It  is  characteristic  for  it,  that  the  vacuum  state  at  some  distance
′P  is equivalent to that of vacuum, moving relative to it with a certain velocity. This velocity is equal to the velocity 
material point 
′P   has  started  at  infinity  with  a  zero 
a  material  particle  would  have  at  the  same  distance  in  case  its  motion  relative  to  point 
velocity. A mechanical model of the activated state of vacuum is proposed. This model explains the negative result of Michelson 
experiment  used  to  determine  the  velocity  of  Earth  relative  to  ether.  Another  basic  assumption    is  that  a  privileged  inertial 
reference frame  K  exists, relative to which the laws of the gravitational phenomena are valid. The three Newton laws of motion 
are in force in the vacuum field theory. The other laws valid in it are: the law of equality of inertial and gravitation mass the law of 
change  of  material  point  mass  in  its  motion  relative  to  frame  K ,  the  law  of  a  material  point  mass  in  the  gravitation  field  of 
another material point and the gravitation law. The motion of a material point,
, is investigated in a 
static  spherically  symmetric  gravitation  field.  As  a  result  the  well-known  formula  in  general  relativity,  the  one  concerning  the 
planet perihelion shift and a new phenomena – the change in time of a material point orbit from close to elliptical into  circular 
one are obtained. The integral of energy is investigated in the spherically symmetric gravitation field in a way close to the classical  
one for the celestial mechanics, as well as momentum and energy of a material point. As a result, the final form of their  formu- 
las is obtained.  The  deflection  of  light  in  a  static  spherically  symmetric  gravitation  field  is  considered.  Assuming  that  the  mass   
of a photon  in  its  motion  in  the  above-mentioned  field  remains  equal  to  zero,  then  for  the  deflection  of  light  a  formula  is  obtai- 
ned, identical  to that in general relativity. It is shown that the velocity of  light during the propagation, under discussion, appears 
 to be smaller  than  that    in  a  space  without  gravitation.  The  result  obtained  while  investigating  the  delay  in  the  propagation   
of  the    electromagnetic wave in  a  static spherically symmetric gravitation field coincides with  the one  in  general  relativity. 
The  final  question  discussed  is  the  change  of    light wave    frequency  in  a  static  spherically  symmetric  gravitation  field  and  the  
well-known formula for the process is obtained.

1.  Axiom of the activated state of vacuum in a gravitation field 

 

 

Unlike  general  relativity  the  gravitation  theory  of  the  vacuum  field  theory  assumes  that  a  privileged  inertial  reference 
  
frame exists in which the gravitation phenomena should be treated. This frame, as in the mechanics of the vacuum field theory, is 
the proper reference frame of vacuum  K ,situated in the space, where the material points or the spherically symmetric bodies are 
situated. Another requirement which frame  K  must meet is that it must be situated so far away from the interacting objects that 
their gravitational influence on the time passing in it can be neglected. As for the Solar system, frame  K  should be situated in a 
point of its gravitational sphere where the sum of all gravitation and inertial forces is equal to zero. 
 

To explain the nature of the gravitation interaction of the material points, the speed  v  of  a material point  P  with a mass 
′P  with mass      immovable  relative  to  frame
 in  its  radial accelerative motion in the gravitational field of the material point 
m
K , should  be  determined.  Assuming that at an infinite distance the velocity of point   P  was equal to zero and its mass  was  m0, 
and applying the energy conservation law, the speed v of point  P  in its motion will be

  ′m

v =

,                                                                                           (1) 

  2γ ′m
r

whereγ  is a gravitational constant and  r  is the distance between the points  P  and 

′P . 

In  [6]  supplement  5.2  it  has  been  proved  that  the  field  action  of  locally  accelerating  systems  on  a  material  point P , 
moving in a static spherically symmetric gravitational field, may be substituted with the action of a field of locally inertial frames 
on the same point. It means that, at any moment of time, we can consider that the gravitational action of the material point  P′ , on 
,LK
the material point  P , depends both on other physical values and on the velocity of the latter relative to a local inertial frame 
 
P  and is moving radially to point  P′  at a speed v, satisfying the formula (1). In the vacuum 
 as in any reference frame, is at rest (in an inactivated state) and on 
K ,  all  the  kinematic  and  dynamic  dependences  ,  deduced  in  the  case  of  frame  K′ ,  

whose origin coincides with the point 
field theory we shall also assume that vacuum in frame 

moving  the  frame 
moving relative to frame  K  in [1] and [2], hold true. Being examined relative to point  P′ ,vacuum in frame 
relative to it at speed v. Since an inertial frame, possessing the characteristics of frame

LK
, can be placed at any point of  space 
P′ ,  we  can  say  that    vacuum  around  point  P′   is  in  an  activated  state.  It  is  equivalent  to  a  radial  movement  of

around  point

2.  Mechanical model of the activated state of  vacuum and Michelson experiment 

v

 
The vacuum field theory proposes a mechanical model of the activated state of vacuum, assuming, that vacuum represents 
a  gas of  material    m   particles  with dimensions and weight much smaller than those of the atom. It is considered that under 
gravitation action the  m  particles move radially towards the material point 
The  model  accepted  for  the  activated  state  of  vacuum  in  the  gravitation  field  explains  to  the  full  the  negative  result  of 
 
Michelson experiment [3]. In an equipotential plane, in which the experiment takes place, vacuum is in an uniform activated state, 
i. e. the 
 particles reach the equipotential plane with uniform velocities parallel to its normal. This proves the impossibility of 
measuring the velocity of Earth relative to vacuum in that way.

3.  Gravitation theory laws in the vacuum field theory 
 

The three Newton laws of motion remain in force in the gravitation theory of the vacuum field theory. In their application 

 
it should always be borne in mind that the masses of the material points  P  and 
4. The law of equivalency of the inertial and gravitational mass. 
 
5. The law concerning the change of the material point mass in its motion relative to the proper reference frame  K  of 
 
vacuum in the space where it is situated. It states: in case a material point  P  moves relative to frame  K  at  random speed  v   〈 c  its 
mass  m  should be equal to 

′P  obey the three laws, mentioned below:

This  formula  indicates,  that  the  light  velocity  relative  to  frame  K   in  the  presence  of  a  gravitational  field  is  smaller 

 
compared to that in a space without gravitation. 
 

9.  Delay of a radar signal in a static spherically symmetric gravitation field 

 
Another  effect,  connected  with  the  electromagnetic  wave  in  a  static  spherically  symmetric  gravitation  field  is  its 
propagation delay. To observe it, radio waves are sent from a radar, situated on the Earth, to a reflector situated at another point of 
the Solar system. The reflector sends these waves back to the Earth. Let us investigate the first approximation of the radar signal 
delay,  assuming,  that  the  Earth  and  the  reflector  do  not  rotate,  i.e.  they  are  immovable  in  the  static  spherically  symmetric 
gravitation field of the Sun. For the first approximation only the delay due to the change in the wave velocity along its straight-line 
trajectory from the transmitter on the Earth to the reflector and back, accomplished in the gravitation field, would be taken into 
consideration. 
 

Let us assume, that the Earth transmitter and the reflector lie in the plane 

 of the coordinate system O X

, the

origin  of  which  coincides  with  the  center  of  the  Sun  (Fig.  2).  The  axis

where  γ   is the “ magnitude  of  space  curvature, created by a unit of immovable mass”. Using a radar of planets and satellites 
proved the magnitude of γ  in general relativity, namely 
, is proved. 
 
From the delay of radio waves in the gravitational field, we can find out whether the space is a Newtonean  space or a 
Riemannean space. A more precise determination of the time-delay in the Solar system can be obtained if it is determined in the 
system of two satellites, launched in circular orbits around a given planet or around the Sun. The orbits of the two satellites should 
have different radii and should lie in one and the same plane.

10.  Light wave frequency change in a static spherically symmetric gravitation field 

Let us discuss in frame  K  the propagation of a light wave of one and the same wave length in a static gravitation field, 
  (see  Sec.  4)  and  in  a  space  without  a 
 will 
K . Due to the fact, that in the vacuum field theory the Newtonean space is 

 
created  by  a  spherically  symmetric  body 
gravitation field. Let us assume, that light propagates along the axis  O X  of frame 
OX
be considered coinciding with the axis 
accepted, the wave length λ of the light wave is uniform relative to frames  K  and 
 

′m   and  a  center  in  point

If the light wave frequencies in  K and

Abstract - This paper presents theoretical results indicating that newly discovered nondiffracting 

beams we call X waves, can propagate in a confined space (wave guide) with specific quantized 

temporal  frequencies.  These  results  could  have  applications  in  nondispersive  transmission  of 

acoustic,  electromagnetic  (microwaves)  and  optical  energy  through  wave  guides  as  well  as 

provide new localized wave functions of de Broglie waves in quantum mechanics.  

I. INTRODUCTION 

Recently,  families  of  generalized  solutions  to  the  isotropic/homogeneous  scalar  wave  equation 

which  represent  nondiffracting  waves  have  been  discovered  (Lu  and  Greenleaf,  1992a).  These 

nondiffracting  waves  are  not  physically  realizable  because  infinite  aperture  and  energy  are 

required  to  produce  them.  However,  approximate  nondiffracting  waves  can  be  produced  over 

deep depth of field by truncating them in both space and time resulting in possible applications in 

medical imaging and tissue characterization (Lu and Greenleaf, 1990a, 1990b, 1991, 1992b). In 

this paper, it is shown that temporal-frequency quantized nondiffracting X waves can propagate 

in a confined space such as a wave guide, normally highly dispersive devices under appropriate 

boundary  conditions.  This  would  allow  nondispersive  transmission  of  energy.  Shaarawi  et  al. 

(1989)  and  Ziolkowski  et  al.  (1991)  have  shown  that  the  “localized  waves”  such  as  Focused 

Wave Modes and Modified Power Spectrum Pulses, etc., can also propagate in wave guides for 

an extended propagation depth. These results are important because they could have applications 

in  acoustic  and  electromagnetic  energy  transmission,  seismology,  underwater  acoustics,  fiber 

optics and microwaves, etc.

II. ACOUSTIC WAVES

governed by the following scalar wave equation

lossless fluid medium can be used as an example. In this case, the normal vibration velocity of 

the  medium  at  the  wall  of  the  cylindrical  wave  guide  will  be  zero  for  all  the  frequency

(

.  Unlike  conventional  guided  waves,  the 

frequency quantized nondiffracting X waves contain multiple frequencies and propagate through 

wave guides at the speed of 

 without dispersion. It is noticed that similar results can also be 

1c

obtained for wave guides with other homogeneous boundary conditions such as an infinitely long 

cylindrical  acoustical  wave  guide  with  a  diameter  of  a   which 

is  composed  of 

isotropic/homogeneous  lossless  media  in  a  free  space  (vacuum).  In  this  case,  the  acoustical 

pressure is zero at the boundary of the wave guide,

, in (6) are 

μ

roots  of 

nJ x

( )=0, (

n =

1,  2,  ...)

.  See  Figs.  1  to  3  for  an  example  of  the  waves  in  an  acoustic 

waveguide.  

Now  we  discuss  briefly  the  implications  of  (8).  If 

0n = ,  (8)  represents  an  axially  symmetric 

frequency quantized nondiffracting X wave. Because 

 in (8) is arbitrary, a source with any 

)njB k
(

system transfer function can be used to excite the frequency quantized nondiffracting X waves. 

The  X  waves  in  (8)  have  a  finite  transverse  spatial  extension  because  the  radius, 

a

,  is  finite. 

Because the frequency quantized nondiffracting X waves are a superposition of CW waves with 

various frequencies, they are noncausal.  

4 

The  frequency  quantized  nondiffracting  X  waves  will  become  nondiffracting  X  waves  in  the 

limit, that is, if 

a → ∞

, then 

njkΔ →

0

 and the summation in (8) becomes an integration which 

represents the nondiffracting X waves. On the other hand, if the confined space is reduced, i.e., 

a →

0

, both 

njk

 and 

Δ → ∞

njk

 ( ,

n j

=

0,  1,  2,  ...)

. This means that for a small wave guide, only 

high frequency quantized nondiffracting X waves can propagate through it.  

Additional nondiffracting waves with quantized parameters could also propagate in the confined 

space. For instance, let

III. DE BROGLIE’S WAVES

given by (Sandin, 1989):  

where 

/ 2h π=(cid:61)

 

h

 is the Plank constant, 

m

 is mass of particle, 

Φ  is wave function of the de 

Broglie’s waves and V  is a potential energy function of the system. For free-particles, 

0V = , we 

obtain:

With a finite transverse spatial extension (such as a free particle passing through a hole of finite

behind  the  hole.  However,  if  the  nondiffracting  X  waves  in  (24)  is  quantized  in  temporal 

frequency  under  the  boundary  conditions  discussed  in  the  previous  sections  (such  as  particles 

pass  through  a  pipe),  the  frequency  quantized  nondiffracting  X  wave  functions  of  the  particles 

would propagate in the confined space without modifying their complex waveforms:

Because the wavenumber,  k , in (25) is quantized, the momentum,  p

k= (cid:61) ; and the energy of the 

particles are quantized in the confined space. The probability of finding a particle in the confined 

space would be proportional to

IV. DISCUSSION 

a. Possible Relationship between Waves and Particles  

Because  of  the  fact  that  the  frequency  quantized  nondiffracting  X  waves  are  localized  and  are 

also  solutions  of  the  nonrelativistic  Shrodinger  wave  equation  for  free  particles  (the  potential 

energy function of the system is zero), they might have some intrinsic relationship with particles. 

The  free  choice  of  the  parameter, 

0

,  could  increase  the  localization  of  the  frequency 

a >
0

quantized nondiffracting X waves.  

b. Interaction between Light and Materials  

The light in free space behaves like a wave, but acts as particles (photons) when interacts with 

materials.  The  microscopic  structures  of  the  materials  could  be  considered  as  some  kind  of 

optical wave guides within which the light waves are confined. From the above discussion of the 

nondiffracting X waves in a confined space, it is understood that only the light waves which have 

higher energy (or frequency) can penetrate the materials to cause the interaction.  

The generalized nondiffracting waves discovered recently can propagate in a confined space with 

quantization  of  some  parameters.  This  is  of  interest  because  they  are  localized  and  could  be 

applied to acoustic, electromagnetic, and optical wave guides for energy transmission.

Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. The paper was revised on March 7, 1992 after it was proof 

read by Dr. James F. Greenleaf. However, this paper has never been published. Upon the request 

by Dr. Erasmo Recami, this paper was sent to him on January 20, 2000. Later, he had 

acknowledged this paper in his 2001 Physical Review E paper (see the Acknowledgements 

Section below). To provide a reference, Dr. Jian-yu Lu is going to place this paper in arXiv 

unmodified from the version of March 7, 1992. Therefore, this paper represents the views and 

results (correct or incorrect) of Dr. Jian-yu Lu of that time.

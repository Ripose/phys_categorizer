Abstract 
   We have demonstrated experimentally that recently developed gaseous detectors with 
resistive electrodes combined with solid or gaseous photo-cathodes have exceptionally 
low noise and high quantum efficiency for UV photons while being solar blind. For this 
reason they can be used for the detection of weak UV sources in daylight conditions. 
These detectors are extremely robust, can operate in poor gas conditions and are cheap. 
We present the first results of their applications to hyper-spectroscopy and flame 
detection in daylight conditions. 
 
I. Introduction 
 
   In the last few years, a great interest arose for solar blind UV imaging detectors as 
requested by new applications such as hyperspectroscopy [1-3] and visualization of UV 
sources in daylight conditions [4]. 
   Currently, advanced microchannel plate detectors (MCPs), sensitive in the spectral 
interval 300-850 nm [1], are used for these applications. With this approach the very 
weak UV light has to be detected against the very strong visible light background. This 
puts very strong constrains on the signal to noise ratio [1, 4] and the development of low 
noise MCPs is rapidly progressing [5]. However, the recently developed photosensitive 
micropattern gaseous detectors (see [6, 7] and references therein) may successfully 
compete with MCPs in some applications. Indeed, these detectors have several interesting 
features: they are solar blind, they have good position resolution and high efficiency for 
UV detection. Their planar geometry is very well suited to cover very large area because 
of the weak constrains on the window size. Last but not least, photosensitive gaseous 
detectors have extremely low thermo-electronic noise. There are two fundamental 
reasons for this: 
i) in contrast to MCPs, in gaseous detectors there are no high kinetic energy positive ions 
which cause the so called ‘kinetic electron extraction” from the cathode [8], ii) in some 
gas mixtures, adsorbed layers can be formed on the cathode (see for example [9]) 
preventing low energy electrons (for example, thermo- electrons) to reach the detector 
sensitive volume (see below for details).  
   Recently, we improved the performance of micropattern gaseous detectors by coating 
the electrodes with a resistive layer which greatly increases their robustness against 

discharges. Two devices were developed and tested: a microgap resistive plate chamber 
(MGRPC) [10] combined with a CsI photo-cathode and a thick GEM with resistive 
electrodes (RETGEM) [11] coupled to a CsTe/CsI photo-cathode [3].  
   In this work we present the results from the first application of such detectors to the 
detection of UV photons in daylight conditions. 
 
II. Application of photosensitive MGRPC to UV hyper-spectroscopy  
 
   Hyper-spectroscopy is a new method of surface imaging which provides 
simultaneously both high position and spectral resolution allowing for remotely studying 
the chemical composition of the surfaces [1, 3]. This is achieved by means of a special 
spectrograph (called a hyper-spectrograph, see Fig.1) combined with an optical system 
which selects a narrow strip (with length A and width ΔB) on the surface under study 
(hereafter called “strip of interest”, see Fig. 2). The hyper- spectrograph forms in its focal 
plane a reduced image of the strip of size (A/M) x(ΔB/M) (where M is a coefficient 
determined by the optical system) for each wavelength interval. As an example, let’s 
assume that a part of the surface of the strip of interest with coordinates y1<y<y6 emits a 
narrow line centered at the wavelength λ1, the other part of its surface with coordinates 
y3<y<y4 emits a line with wavelength λ2 and the other part of the surface y2<y<y5 emits 
at wavelength λ3. In this case the image of the strip in the focal plane of the spectrograph 
will look as in Fig 3.    For simplicity let’s also assume that the two -dimensional (2D) 
position resolution of the system is ~ΔB and the input slit of the hyper- spectrograph is 
adjusted to the value ΔB/M. In this case in the focal plane of the hyper- spectrograph a 
spectrally resolved image of the strip with a spectral resolution ΔS= S ΔB/M will be 
formed, where S is the spectral resolving power of the spectrograph S=Δλ/ΔL, L being 
the length of the region in the focal plane of the spectrometer on which the spectrum is 
projected. To record the image a 2D position sensitive photo-detector is needed  (see 
Fig.1) with a typical requirement  for position resolution being  50-100 μm (usually 
M>>1 so a very high position resolution detector  is needed for the surface analysis). 
Often the hyper- spectrograph is installed on an aircraft to perform a scan of the surface 
of the earth; the strip of interest will move with the aircraft. In such a way a two 
dimensional image of the surface with both high position and spectral resolutions is 
obtained.  This results in a very high recognition power since such a method provides 
much larger amount of information than, for instance, a color pictures or the human eye; 
it allows for quantitative statements about the chemical composition of the surface. 
Another important application is the detection of sub-pixel objects, i.e.  objects with size 
smaller than the pixel resolution (ΔB/M in the case of our particular example) and the 
estimation of the relative abundance of the different compounds present inside the pixel. 
Until recently, hyper spectroscopy measurements were performed in the spectral region 
300-860 nm [1] and in most cases using sunlight as the radiation source. 
   Our work aims at extending the hyper-spectroscopic method into the UV region, 
namely in the wavelength range 185-230 nm, where the additional information is present. 
Sunlight in the interval 185-280 nm is fully absorbed in the upper layers of the 
atmosphere by the ozone, however the atmosphere is transparent in this range at the 
ground level. More precisely, it is transparent for distances smaller than 100 m and 
transparent in the range 250-280 nm for larger distances (of the order of a km) 

{12,13,14]. Thus to perform the hyper-spectroscopy measurements in the  interval of 
185-280 nm, an artificial UV source is required which, in most practical cases, has a 
rather  low intensity calling for low noise, high efficiency detectors. In this work we 
investigate the potential of MGRPC, developed earlier for RICH applications [10], and 
RETGEM [3, 11] to hyper-spectroscopy.  
  Fig.4 shows a schematic view of our apparatus. It consists of a hyper-spectrometer 
combined with a gaseous detector, MGRPC with CsI photocathode or RETGEM with the 
CsTe/CsI photocathode.  The optical system projects the image of the sample under study 
into the entrance slit of the hyper-spectrometer. Since the detectors used in this work had 
only 1D position capability (see [10]) the measurements were performed in two steps: 
first the spectrum at different positions along the strip of interest (width 0.3 mm) was 
measured, then the detector was turned by 90° (along the line perpendicular to the focal 
plane) and the image of the strip was recorded for each spectral interval. As an example 
Fig. 5a shows a 1D digital hyper-spectroscopy image of two superimposed yellow papers 
(see [3]). During this measurement the gas gain was 105 and the noise rate was ~1 Hz 
(see Figures 5b-d). The detector was operated without degradation of the quality of the 
image up to gains of 5x105, while the noise rate in this condition was less than 5 Hz. We 
believe that it will be impossible to achieve such an image quality with presently 
available MCPs, as they have a typical noise (after optimization of the gain and the 
threshold of the electronics) close to 1 kHz. Indeed, when we used a low noise 
photomultiplier1 (PMT) for independent spectroscopic measurements,  with a noise level 
close to ~500 Hz and at a gain of 5x105 (an exit slit was installed in the focal plane of the 
hyperspectrometer in this case) it was possible to detect only light with λ> 250 nm (lines 
at λ= 253, 296 and 302 nm); the spectrum with λ smaller than 250 nm was completely 
buried in the noise (PMT’s internal  noise and the scattered long wavelength  light). 
When the PMT was cooled (by LN2 vapours) to -40°C, the dark noise remained on the 
level ~45 Hz (the PM gain was 5x105, the mean signal amplitude after the multiplication 
was ~300 mV, the threshold was of 100 mV). The noise PM pulses at this temperature 
were grouped in bunches with time between pulses in bunches varying from a few to 10 
μs indicating their ion feedback nature. However, even the cooled PM was not able to 
detect the radiation in the spectral range of 185-250 nm due to the strong scattered long 
wavelength light. This demonstrates the advantage of our approach for measurements in 
the spectral interval of 185-250 nm.  Moreover MGRPCs are considerably cheaper than 
PMTs or MCPs. It is not very difficult to equip ours detectors with an electronic readout 
allowing for 2D position measurements. MGRPCs detectors are insensitive to vibrations 
and therefore they can be mounted, together with an UV source, on helicopters and used 
to perform environmental monitoring of the earth.  
 
 
III. The detection of flames  
 
   A second promising application is the detection of UV emitters, like corona discharges, 
sparks and, for practical reasons, flames under day light conditions. As mentioned above, 
the sunlight in the wavelength interval 185-280 nm is fully absorbed in the upper layers 
of the atmosphere, offering a unique possibility to detect artificial UV sources without

background from the Sun. Several commercial devices already exploit this feature (see 
for example [15] and references therein). However, more sophisticated detectors can 
provide better and more accurate information leading to important technical and 
commercial applications [4]. 
   Currently, image intensifiers combined with narrow band filters are used in some 
special applications for UV visualization [4, 16]. The MCPs used in these detectors are 
sensitive in a wide range of wavelengths: from UV to visible light (they have bi-alkaline 
photo-cathodes) and to suppress the light with λ>280 nm, narrow band filters are used 
with a transmission less than 10% in the wavelength interval 240-280 nm. This implies 
low efficiency for the detection of the UV light. These devices are difficult to produce, 
and have high cost; therefore they did not yet find wide application. 
We have recently demonstrated  that photo-sensitive gaseous detectors with resistive 
electrodes can compete with image intensifiers in the detection of flames on relatively 
short distances, less than  100 m[3,15]. 
   The MGRPC with CsI photocathode described above was able to detect the flame from 
a match or a cigarette lighter at a distance of 30 m inside a fully illuminated building: the 
counting rate produced by the UV light from these flames was 400-450 Hz, whereas the 
counting rate in the same conditions but in absence of the flame was of the order of 1 Hz 
mainly caused by cosmic rays. Even higher sensitivity was achieved with RETGEMS 
combined with CsTe/CsI photo-cathodes [3] or with RETGEMs combined with 
SbCsI/CsI [17]. These detectors were able to detect small flames at a distance of 60 m. In 
these detectors the CsI protective layer did not allow for small energy photo-electrons to 
pass through [18] and as a result it cuts the sensitivity of the photo-cathode to photons 
with λ larger than 280 nm [19, 20], enhancing the sensitivity to short wavelengths 
(λ<280nm) [19, 20]. Because the transmission of this film strongly decreases with the 
electron’s energy, the CsI coating allows also considerably suppress the thermo- 
electronic noise 
   Unfortunately, detectors with CsTe/CsI or SbCsI/CsI photo-cathodes are very 
demanding in term of gas purity in order to achieve long term stable operation. 
   In this work we developed an improved version of solar blind gaseous detectors using 
photosensitive vapors EF [21] or TMAE [21] instead of solid photocathodes. The main 
improvement is the capability to operate under poor gas conditions, leading to a very 
competitive production cost. 
   The scheme of this detector is presented in Fig.6a. It consists of a gas chamber (filled 
with a mixture of Ar with EF or TMAE vapors at a total pressure of 1atm) combined with 
a lens (focal length F= 50 cm). Two RETGEM, operated in cascade mode, and a readout 
plate are installed inside the gas chamber.  
   The RETGEM has an active area of 40x40 mm2 or 100x100 mm2 and a thickness of 0.4 
mm. The diameter of the holes is 0.3 mm, the pitch 0.7 mm. Instead of graphite coating in 
this work we used either CrO or CuO resistive coating [17], which, compared to graphite 
coating, allowed for more stable operation of the RETGEM because it does not absorb 
photosensitive vapors. The schematic drawing of the readout plate is shown in Fig. 6b. It 
was made out of a G-10 plate with a fan-out of 10 Cu strips converging in one point 
corresponding to the centre of the lens placed 50 cm away from the middle of the 
RETGEM plane (see Fig. 6b). Each strip was individually readout. 

   In this geometry (F>>d, where d is the size of the RETGEM), the UV photons from the 
flame are projected along one or two strips and cause the photo-ionization of the photo-
sensitive the vapors. The photo-electrons created in the drift region trigger Townsend 
avalanches in the holes of the RETGEM which in turn induce pulses on the readout 
strips. The typical overall gain at which we operated the double step RETGEMs was 
~105. Since photosensitive vapors have a zero efficiency for λ larger than 220 nm [21] 
such a detector  was able to operate with a very small background counting rate even in 
presence of direct sunlight  (see Fig. 7a). Also note that at higher gain the pulse height 
spectra began to deviate from the exponential form, see Fig. 7b. By pulse counting it is 
possible to obtain a 1D digital image of the flame. As an example Fig.8 a, b shows the 
image of an alcohol flame, approximately 5x5x5 cm3 placed 70 m away from the 
detector. The image was obtained in open air on a sunny day. Note that for the human eye 
such a small flame is practically invisible in the same light conditions. The comparison 
between Figures 8a and 8b shows that the sensitivity of the detector filled with the 
TMAE vapors was a few time higher than with the EF vapors. However, EF vapors are 
not chemically aggressive and remain stable even in air. 
   During the test with the EF vapors we discovered that RETGEM could operate at gains 
of 3x104-105 in gas mixtures with air and even in pure air. For example, the detector 
could operate perfectly well with the mixture of Ar+EF+ 10% of air. This offers a very 
simple and cheap design in some applications since no special tightness of the gas vessel 
is required. In a particular case of the UV photon detection, the efficiency remained high 
only at small air concentration (<1%). Note that even if the EF vapors leak into the room, 
they are not toxic or dangerous for the environment. A drop of liquid EF placed inside the 
detector will make it able to operate even in presence of small leaks because the leaking 
out vapors will be compensated by the evaporation of the EF drop. Of course the voltage 
at which detector operates will gradually changed, but it could be easily compensated by 
a simple automatic HV circuit. Certainly we do not suggest in this work to manufacture 
leaking detectors, what we want to emphasize is that the design of this detector could be 
very simple and thus cheap. 
   We compared the sensitivity of our gaseous detector filled with EF to a commercial UV 
device. The result was that our detector was about 100 times more sensitive than 
commercial UV sensors of flames, for example Hamamatsu R2868 [22], see Table 1. 
  We also tried to compare our detector with the MCP- based UV image intensifier; it had 
a bi-alkali photocathode combined with an interference UV filter. Due to the high rate of 
noise pulses (>1 kHz with the electronics used for this detector) we were able to detect 
flames from matches at a distance of <30 m. Taking into account the difference in the 
focusing optical system used for the image intensifier and for our detector, we concluded 
that our detector was 5-7 times more sensitive at short distances (less than 100 m). 
However, for the flames placed at a distance larger than 150 m, the sensitivity of our 
detector began degrading due to the abortion of the light in air and  the MCP becomes 
much more e sensitive since it operates in the wavelength interval of 240-280nm. 
Slightly better results were obtained with TMAE filled detectors which were more 
sensitive than the image intensifier up to a distance of 200 m.  
 
 
IV. Discussion: 

 
   Due to the low noise and the high sensitivity to UV and imaging capabilities, our 
detectors offer an attractive solution for the detection of weak UV radiation sources in the 
presence of a strong visible background. For example, they are almost 100 times more 
sensitive than commercial UV flame detectors. 
   Low noise, high sensitivity PMTs exist on the market since long time and low noise 
MCPs are under development. However, these devices are, for the moment, too 
expensive for massive use in flame detection. Moreover PMTs, due to the resistive chain 
of the voltage divider, consume a lot of power while an ideal flame detector should be 
battery fed. Gaseous detectors offer important advantages: they are cheap, have high 
efficiency to UV light [21] and could be battery fed. Gaseous detectors operating with 
photosensitive vapors have additional advantages: they have practically zero efficiency 
for λ larger than 225 nm whereas most of the detectors with solid photocathodes may be 
noisy in the presence of the sunlight due to the small sensitivity to long wavelength 
radiations (see [2] for more details). Thus after long operation in direct sunlight 
conditions the photocathode may degrade due to the aging effect caused by visible light. 
In the case of the hyper-spectroscopy application, photosensitive gaseous detectors can 
compete with MCPs only for wavelength shorter than 250 nm and only in measurements 
performed in the presence of a strong visible background. Low noise MCPs with CsTe or 
CsI photo-cathodes today under development may offer in the future better performance 
than detectors. 
 
  
IV. Conclusions 
 
   Our studies have shown that gaseous detectors with resistive electrodes can compete 
with commercially available UV sensitive detectors in several applications, namely for 
hyper-spectroscopy and flame visualization up to a distanced of about 200 m. At the 
same time compared to commercial UV flame sensors or UV image intensifiers they can 
offer much larger sensitive area at lower price.

Table 1. Counting rate from the commercial UV flame sensor Hamamatsu R2868 and 
from our detector both detecting the UV light from a candle placed at various distances 
from the detectors under indirect sunlight conditions. The mean amplitude of the signal 
from our detector was 500 mV (exponential shape), the mean amplitude from the R2868 
after the attenuation by the probe (1:10) was of 2 V (narrow pick shape), the threshold of 
the scalier was set to 200 mV. The counting rate at the same conditions but without the 
candle was ~1 Hz for the R2868 and a few Hz for our detector.

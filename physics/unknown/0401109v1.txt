Abstract
A novel Monte Carlo technique of simulation of spatial ﬂuorescence
distribution within the human skin is presented. The computational model of
skin takes into account the spatial distribution of ﬂuorophores, which would
arise due to the structure of collagen ﬁbres, compared to the epidermis and
stratum corneum where the distribution of ﬂuorophores is assumed to be
homogeneous. The results of simulation suggest that distribution of
auto-ﬂuorescence is signiﬁcantly suppressed in the near-infrared spectral
region, whereas the spatial distribution of ﬂuorescence sources within a
sensor layer embedded in the epidermis is localized at an ‘effective’ depth.

1. Introduction

Optical techniques have recently been received considerable
attention in the ﬁelds of biomedical diagnostics and monitoring
of biological tissues [1, 2]. The ﬂuorescence spectroscopy is
notable among other non-invasive diagnostic techniques, as it
offers an exciting precision, selectivity and sensitivity to the
biochemical make-up of tissues [3–5].

Recently,

a new non-invasive optical/ﬂuorescence
technique for express clinical diagnostics and therapeutic
This new
monitoring of skin has been proposed [6].
technique is based on scanning a ‘tattoo’ pattern transferred
on the skin in a similar manner to children’s non-permanent
‘tattoos’. Typically, the later are simply removed by several
washings. By incorporating ‘smart’ polymer nano-particles
within the ‘tattoo’ formulation it will be possible to generate
ﬂuorescence signals with speciﬁc spectral signatures that are
indicative of the state of the tissue. Thus, physiological
changes pertaining to temperature,
the concentration of
metabolites or the presence of drugs can be determined.
Since a ‘tattoo’ can combine several chemical sensors,
either by intermixing or by separate patterning on to the
skin, multi-parameter measurements are possible.
This
new methodology has considerable clinical potential both in
hospitals and in surgeries. We envisage usage for routine
monitoring as well as for the more complex therapeutic
management of drug administration. Other important potential

applications include: early warning of excessive exposure to
ultraviolet radiation, general health monitoring, fundamental
physiological
to
cosmetics or household products, allergy detection, etc.

investigations, measuring sensitivities

The total ﬂuorescence of skin tissues-‘tattoo’ comprises
of the auto-ﬂuorescence, i.e. the ﬂuorescence of endogenous
ﬂuorophores such as amino acids (tryptophan, tyrosine) and
structural proteins (collagen and elastin) randomly distributed
within the skin, and the ﬂuorescence of the exogenous
ﬂuorophores associated with the ‘tattoo’ pattern. The turbidity
of skin tissues hampers the interpretation of the direct
ﬂuorescence measurements as intrinsic ﬂuorescence [7, 8].
The analysis of the contribution of endogenous and exogenous
ﬂuorophores to the detected signal requires a knowledge of
the spatial distribution of the ﬂuorescence sources within
the tissues. We have investigated where the ﬂuorescence is
excited in tissues and how the distribution of ﬂuorescence
sources depends on the ﬂuorophore parameters as well as
optical variations in the tissue. The goal of this study is to
estimate the effect of ﬂuorescence sources heterogeneously
distributed in a model of skin. To predict the ﬂuorescence
distribution in biological media, various techniques have
been developed and used. These include electromagnetic
theory [9], Kubelka–Munk approximation [10], the diffusion
theory [11, 12], random walk theory [13–15] and Monte Carlo
(MC) techniques [16–23]. The MC technique has a number
of advantages over analytical models: different boundary

conditions can be accounted for; the technique allows the
investigation of various phenomena; the method is suitable
for both highly scattering and absorbing multilayered media;
the technique may also be adapted for ﬂuorescence modelling.
This report describes a novel MC technique used to simulate
spatial distribution of ﬂuorescence excitation in a model of
human skin.

2. Method of simulation

2.1. MC simulation of light propagation in a medium

The stochastic numerical MC method is widely used to
model optical radiation propagation in complex randomly
inhomogeneous highly scattering and absorbing media such
as biological tissues [24–30]. Basic MC modelling of an
individual photon packets trajectory consists of the sequence
of the elementary simulations [24–28]: photon pathlength
generation, scattering and absorption events, reﬂection or/and
refraction on the medium boundaries. The initial and ﬁnal
states of the photons are entirely determined by the source-
detector geometry. The photons packets are launched in the
medium within a uniform random distribution over the angles
deﬁned by numerical aperture of source. At the scattering site
a new photon packet direction is determined according to the
Henyey–Greenstein scattering phase function [31].

In contrast to previous works [24–28], we use an MC
technique, which combines the statistical weight scheme and
effective optical photon paths [29, 30]. In framework of this
approach, absorption occurs between the scattering events
In other words, the medium consists of a scattering-

centre matrix embedded within an absorbing continuum
that is consistent with the microscopic Beer–Lambert law.
Absorption is realized by recalculating the statistical weight of
each photon packet according to its pathlength between source
and detector areas [29, 30]:

Here, W is the statistical weight of a photon packet at the
Nth step of propagation within the medium, W0 is the initial
weight of the photon packet, µa is the absorption coefﬁcient
per unit pathlength li, N is the total number of scattering
events undergone by the photon packet during its random walk.
The internal photon packet reﬂection/refraction on the medium
boundary are taken into account by splitting the photon packet
into the reﬂected and the transmitted parts [30, 32]. This
procedure is important for the shallow probing of skin tissues
[29, 32]. The simulation of a photon packet tracing is truncated
when its statistical weight is less than 10−4, or a photon
packet has been scattered more than 104 times. Beyond
these limits the statistical weight of a photon packet is too
small and the packet no longer contributes to the ﬂuorescence
excitation, or the packet has propagated too far from the area
of interest. Typically 105–107 packets of detected photons are
simulated.

The above description of

demonstrates that when a computational model of skin is used
with reasonable physical and structural parameters, the results
of skin diffuse reﬂectance spectra simulation agree reasonably
well with the results of in vivo skin spectra measurements [33]
(ﬁgure 2).

2.2. Fluorescence simulation

Earlier MC schemes of ﬂuorescence modelling consist of
the three simulation steps [16, 17, 19, 20]. First, the ﬂuence
rate distribution within a tissue volume is calculated by
the standard MC scheme [24–28]. At the second step,
spatial ﬂuorescence distribution is obtained by multiplying
the ﬂuence rate distribution to the intrinsic ﬂuorescence
proﬁle, which is deﬁned as the product of the absorption
coefﬁcient of the ﬂuorophore at the excitation wavelength and
its quantum yield at the emission wavelength [19]. Finally,
the detected ﬂuorescence is calculated as the convolution
of the ﬂuorescence source distribution throughout the tissue
with a Green function [16, 17, 19, 20].
In the framework of
this model, the intensity of the simulated local ﬂuorescence

1723

D Y Churmakov et al

is proportional to the fraction of the absorbed energy that
is determined by quantum yield of the ﬂuorophore. The
ﬂuorescence source distribution within the medium is mainly
dependent on the ﬂuence rate distribution. Crilly et al [18]
employed the MC ﬂuorescence forward-adjoin model. This
MC scheme utilizes the solution of a transport equation both in
forward (excitation photon) and in adjoin (ﬂuorescent photon)
calculations. The solution of the adjoin transport equation is
obtained for those ﬂuorescence photons that contribute to the
detected ﬂuorescence signal.

More recently, another scheme of an independent
simulation of the ﬂuorescence acts has been proposed [21].
the emission of the ﬂuorescence
In this later approach,
photons occurs at
the scattering sites and the quantum
yield of a ﬂuorophore γ serves as the ﬂuorescence threshold
probability (ﬁgure 3(a)).
The intensity of simulated
ﬂuorescence is deﬁned by the fraction of the absorbed radiation
Wi−1 − Wi (see ﬁgure 3(a)).
In a more plausible model of
ﬂuorescence simulation [22, 23], the ﬂuorophore absorption
µf
a is separated from the total medium/layer absorption by the
standard rejection scheme based on the ﬂuorophore absorption
threshold Pa = (1 − exp(−µf
a li)) (ﬁgure 3(b)). Here, the
intensity of generated ﬂuorescence is equal to the product of
the quantum yield and the intensity of the incident radiation
γ Wi−1. In this model, each photon packet produces only one
ﬂuorescence event. Both models assumed that the ﬂuorescence
is emitted uniformly from the scattering sites in random
directions (see ﬁgures 3(a) and (b)).

Below we present an extension of the MC technique,
[29, 30] which has been described brieﬂy in section 2.1, for
ﬂuorescence simulation. The schematic of the ﬂuorescence
simulation is given in ﬁgure 4.
The probability of the
ﬂuorescence excitation is determined as:

Q(x, y, z) = W PaPρPγ ,

(2)

where W , deﬁned by equation (1), is the probability that photon
packet has reached a point (x, y, z) in the medium; Pa is
the probability of the photon packet absorption; Pρ is the
probability of absorption by the ﬂuorophore non-uniformly
distributed within the medium; Pγ is the probability of the
ﬂuorescence determined by the ﬂuorophore quantum yield γ .
The probabilities Pa, Pρ, Pγ are calculated by the standard
rejection scheme [34].
In contrast to the above-mentioned
models (see ﬁgures 3(a) and (b)), where ﬂuorescence is
the scattering sites, we deﬁne the origin of
emitted at

ﬂorescence at an arbitrary point (x, y, z) between the scattering

i.e. solely in the absorption sites (see ﬁgure 4).
However, distribution of the ﬂuorophores within the human
skin is complex [1, 7, 35]. The stratum corneum and the
epidermis mainly contain NAD(H), elastin, keratin, ﬂavins
and some other ﬂuorophores randomly distributed within these
layers [1, 35, 36]. In the dermal layers the spatial distribution
of the ﬂuorophore closely follows the distribution of collagen
ﬁbres. The latter are organized in long, wavy bundles, which
vary in diameter between 1 and 40 µm [37–39]. Collagen
bundles interweave in a complex and random manner to form a
three-dimensional irregular meshwork (ﬁgure 5). We describe
this meshwork as:

ρ(r, z) = cos(kr) cos(kz),

(3)

where k = π/d, d is the collagen ﬁbre diameter, r = r(x, y)
and z are the coordinates of a point in the medium. This
non-homogeneous distribution of ﬂuorescence within dermal
layers is clearly illustrated in the experimental images of
auto-ﬂuorescence of human skin (ﬁgure 6), whereas the
distribution of ﬂuorophores in stratum corneum and epidermis
appears to be homogeneous [19, 35]. The current MC model
neglects all polarization effects that might result in anisotropic
ﬂuorescence emission [7]. Therefore, the ﬂuorescence photons
are emitted isotropically from the source points, this agrees
with the assumptions proposed in [16–23].

Fibre bundle diameters and density of packing in the papillary
dermis (PD) and reticular dermis (RD) are different. Collagen is
organized in long, wavy bundles, which vary in diameter from about
1 to 40 µm. Collagen bundles interweave in a complex and random
manner to form a three-dimensional irregular meshwork [38, 39].

3. Results and discussion

The described MC algorithm has been implemented for the
prediction of spatial distribution of the skin auto-ﬂuorescence
and ‘tattoo’ pattern ﬂuorescence. Optical properties of skin
tissues were estimated according to [8, 33] (see table 1 for the
details). Parameters of the sensor layer are assumed to be close
to optical characteristics of the most dominant ﬂuorophores
used in diagnostic measurements [40]. The 488 nm wavelength
was chosen as an excitation wavelength, since it is close
to the ﬂuorescein absorption maximum (494 nm) [40]. The
diameters of collagen bundles were chosen as 3, 6, 20, 30 µm
in the papillary dermis (PD), upper blood net dermis, dermis,
deep blood net dermis, respectively (see table 1).

The results of simulation of spatial distribution of the auto-
ﬂuorescence excitation probabilities within human skin are
shown in ﬁgure 7. The observed ‘porous’, periodical structure
of the auto-ﬂuorescence sources distribution in the skin (see
ﬁgure 7(a)) is the consequence of the collagen meshwork
simulated by equation (3). The spatial distribution of the
ﬂuorescence excitation within dermal layers has a distinct
periodical structure, both seen in ﬁgures 7(a) and (b). The
period of this structure is close to the collagen bundle diameter
of modelled layers, 20 µm (see table 1). The PD lies at
150–250 µm depth and contains small (0.3–3 µm in diameter
[38, 39]), loosely distributed collagen ﬁbres (see ﬁgure 5).
Consequently, the distribution of ﬂuorescence sources in the
PD seems highly granular, and the ﬁne porous structure is

marginally observed (see ﬁgure 7(a)). Figure 7(b) gives a
proﬁle perception of the ﬂuorescence excitation distribution
along the axis z.
This illustrates the texture proﬁle of
the ﬂuorescence excitation within the reticular dermis (RD)
resulting from large diameter of collagen ﬁbres (10–40 µm on
average [38, 39]).
In comparison, in the uppermost part of
dermal layers (250–300 µm) with collagen bundle diameter
of 6 µm, the ﬂuorescence sources structure is not obviously
distinguished (see ﬁgure 7(b)). The calculated probability of
auto-ﬂuorescence excitation in dermal layers is signiﬁcantly
higher than in stratum corneum and epidermis. This agrees
well with experimental data [19, 35].

The new MC model was also employed to simulate the
ﬂuorescence of the exogenous (‘tattoo’) ﬂuorophores. The
‘tattoo’ pattern was modelled as a plane sensor layer, 50 µm
thick embedded within the epidermis (100–150 µm). The
thickness of pure epidermis in this simulation was chosen
as 80 µm (see table 1). The result of simulation shows
a similar porous structure of the auto-ﬂuorescence sources
distribution within the dermal layers (ﬁgure 8(a)). But the
results also predict that the ﬂuorescence excitation in sensor
layer (100–150 µm) and in dermal layers (250–330 µm) is
comparable (see ﬁgure 8(b)).

The auto-ﬂuorescence is greatly reduced provided the
tissue is illuminated at longer excitation wavelength [1, 7].
Additional MC simulations were carried out to illustrate how
localization of the ﬂuorescence sources excitation is affected
by increasing the excitation wavelength towards the near-
infrared. The modelled skin tissues optical properties were
chosen for 700 nm (see table 1). The absorption coefﬁcients
µa of skin layers are taken to be a factor of ten less [8],
however, due to the monotonically decreasing scattering of
skin tissue with wavelength in the range 450–1100 nm [41–43]
the scattering coefﬁcients µs are reduced by a factor of 2–3 (see
table 1). The rest of the optical properties and ﬂuorescence
parameters are assumed to be independent of wavelength,
except for the optical parameters of the sensor layer.

The results of the spatial distribution of the ﬂuorescence
sources are shown in ﬁgure 9(a). The auto-ﬂuorescence
excitation of dermal layers is now highly suppressed due to
the low ﬂuorescence efﬁciency of natural ﬂuorophores in the
near-infrared spectral region [7]. However, it is still observed
in deeper skin layers due to large penetration depth of the
optical radiation in the near-infrared spectral region [8] (see
ﬁgure 9), whereas the main ﬂuorescence excitation is localized
in the sensor layer (see ﬁgure 9(b)).

the sensor layer ﬂuorescence excitation becomes localized at

predictable and consistent with the experimental images of the
skin tissue auto-ﬂuorescence (see ﬁgure 6). In a subsequent
work, we will investigate ‘tattoo’ sampling volume including

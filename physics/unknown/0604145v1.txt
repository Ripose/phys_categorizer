The origin and the meaning of Einstein’s equation 

 
Abstract. We consider the sticky collision between two sphere of equal rest mass, moving 
with equal but opposite speeds in a horizontal plane. The collision takes place on the pan 
of a high sensitivity balance. The conditions of mechanical and thermal equilibrium are 
studied showing that heat developed in the rest frame of the system has a corresponding 
inertial mass.

can be synthesised by stating that mass and energy are different 
manifestations of the same thing, the energy having mass and 
the  mass  being  a  form  of  energy.  Taking  into  account  that  the 
Einstein’s  equation  about  the  equivalence  of  mass  and  energy  is 
often  misinterpreted  in  popular  approaches,  we  make  use  of 
thought  experiments  that  could  illuminate  the  way  in  which  we

reasoning. It could be used to convey the essence of the basic anti-
common  sense  associated  with  special  relativity  helping  us  to 
derive the basic formulas of special relativity like time dilation and 
length  contraction.  The  thought  experiment  could  be  also  used  in 
order  to  find  out  the  result  of  an  experiment  using  the  formulas 
offered  by  theory,  involving  in  many  cases  imaginary  measuring

The 

thought  experiment  we  propose 

involves  a  high 
sensitivity  balance  with  stationary  pans  as  shown  in  Figure  1. 
Consider  on  its  left  pan  two  identical  spheres  of  rest  mass  m0 
moving  in  the  horizontal  plane with  equal  and  opposite  speeds  V 
and  -V  respectively.  Let  T0  be  the  temperature  of  the  ambient 
within which the spheres are in a state of thermal equilibrium with 
the ambient. The problem of the sticky collision between the two 
spheres has two aspects. Before the collision the two spheres are in 
a  state  of  thermal  equilibrium  with  the  ambient  and  in  a  state  of 
mechanical equilibrium if we place on the right pan a body of rest 
mass M0 the energy of which should equate the total energy of the 
two spheres moving on the left pan i.e.

the  conditions  of  mechanical  and  thermal  equilibrium  being 
fulfilled.  
 
After the perfectly inelastic collision the two spheres coalesce into 
a single one at rest. The initial kinetic energy is converted into heat 
and as a result the temperature of the compound particle increases 
becoming equal to T>T0. Under such conditions the balance is still 
in a state of mechanical equilibrium but out of thermal equilibrium 
as  a  result  of  the  fact  that  its  temperature  has  increased.  The 
frame  has  a 
amount  of  heat  developed 
corresponding inertial mass.3

We  consider  that  the  thought  experiment  presented 
 
above  illustrates  the  correct  way  in  which  we  should  apply 
Einstein’s  celebrated  equation.  It  also  shows  that  a  thought 
experiment  proposed  to  students  could  test  if  they  have  a  correct 
representation  about 
  and  about  the  heat-inertial  mass 
equivalence.

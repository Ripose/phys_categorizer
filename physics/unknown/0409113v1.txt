Abstract:  The exact solution for the metric components of a 

coordinate  system  with  constant  acceleration  is  presented.  

The  metric  is  found  using  two  independent  methods  as  an 

analytic demonstration of the equivalence principle.  In the 

first  method  a  uniform  gravitational  field  with  one  degree 

of  freedom  is  assumed.    An  exact  solution  is  obtained  by 

solving  Einstein’s  field  equations  and  requiring  that  the 

metric  produce  a  null  4-space  interval  for  light.    In  the 

second  method  a  constantly  accelerating  reference  frame  is 

assumed.    An  exact  solution  is  then  obtained  by  requiring 

the  metric  to  be  conformally  flat  and  using  the  harmonic 

coordinate conditions.

 

 

 

 

Introduction 

 

In developing the modern theory of gravitation Einstein 

[Einstein    ‘45,  Einstein  ‘52]  assumed  that  constant 

acceleration from reaction forces is indistinguishable from 

a uniform gravitational field.  This assumption leads to the 

equivalence  principle  and  ultimately  to  a  geometric  theory 

describing  the  kinematics  of  these  indistinguishable 

systems.    General  relativity  has  been  spectacularly 

successful  in  providing  improvements  over  the  earlier 

Newtonian  theory  for  gravitational  systems  and  might  be 

expected  to  be  equally  effective  in  improved  calculations 

for  an  equivalent  system  of  constant  acceleration  due  to 

reaction forces. 

In general relativity the principle mathematical object 

for the description of particle trajectories is the metric.  

For the case of a uniform field or constant acceleration the 

literature  is  rich  with  solutions  [Lass,  McRae,  Builder, 

Grunbaum]for  the  components  of  the  metric.    However,  the 

literature is far from unanimous in the determination of the 

exact  form  for  these  components.    Much  of  the  reason  for 

this  lack  of  unanimity  is  that  the  solutions  in  the 

literature  are  often  based  on  physical  reasoning  and  not 

necessarily careful consideration of the field equations of 

general relativity. 

 

 

The  exact  form  of  the  metric  components  of  an 

accelerated  coordinate  system  are  arrived  at  here  by  two 

distinctly  different  methods  analytically  demonstrating  the 

equivalence  principle.    These  two  methods  are  based  on 

Einstein’s  parallel  interpretations  of  the  accelerated 

system.    First  by  assuming  the  presence  of  a  uniform 

gravitational  field,  the  field  equations  of  general 

relativity are solved and the metric is required to produce 

the  null  4-space  interval  for  light.    Second  by  assuming 

that  the  coordinates  are  accelerated  and  restricted  by  the 

harmonic  coordinate  conditions  and  that  the  metric  is 

conformally flat.  As expected both methods produce the same 

metric  components.    The  exact  solution  is  also  found  to 

agree  to  first  order  with  previous  calculations  [Lass, 

McRae, Builder, Grunbaum]. 

The Field Equations 
 

The equivalence principle requires that the metric for 

an  observer  accelerating  in  the    direction  is  the  same  as 

z

that  of  a  uniform  and  constant  gravitational  field.  In 

general this metric may be written as, 

ds 2 = −c2dτ2 = g00dt2 + dx2 + dy2 + g33dz2 ,  

  (1) 

or more conveniently in a system of units where 

, 1=c

ds2 = −V 2dt 2 + dx 2 + dy 2 + U 2dz 2.   

 

  (2) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  noteworthy  that  in  this  system  of  units  the 

acceleration due to gravity is 

0.1≅g

. 

Since  we  are  considering  a  static  metric,  which  is 

unchanged  by  coordinate  transformations  in  x  or 

y

 

(perpendicular  to  the  acceleration),  the  metric  is  subject 

to the conditions that all derivatives are zero except with 

respect  to    (parallel  to  the  acceleration).    In  order  to 

z

be  consistent  with  a  special  relativistic  momentarily 

comoving  frame  (MCMF)  we  must  also  have

)φ21
(

, here φ is the 

scalar  field  of  the  Newtonian  solution  for  a  2-dimensional 

source. 

The  restriction  on  the  metric  are  somewhat  similar  to 

the  Schwarzschild  problem  in  that  only  the 

00g

  and 

33g

 

components  are  unknown  and  have  nonzero  derivatives.    The 

coordinates  chosen  for  the  two  solutions  are  however 

different.    For  the  Schwarzschild  problem  spherical 

coordinates  are  a  natural  choice,  while  Cartesian  or 

cylindrical coordinates are more appropriate for a linearly 

accelerating system. 

 

In  order  to  calculate  the  metric  the  field  equations 

must be solved [Einstein p. 86, Weinberg p. 155],

of  this  equation  is  determined  by  the  mass-energy  source 

terms  and  the  left-hand  side  by  the  4-space  geometry.    The 

components of the Ricci tensor are [Einstein p. 77, Weinberg

In  order  to  solve  for  the  metric  components  we  first

The solution to this is, 

 

 

 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 (17) 

U =

α

∂V
∂z

where  α  is  a  constant.    While  this  equation  provides  a 

relationship  between  the  components  of  the  metric,  the 

differential  equation  is  underdetermined,  since  both  U   and 

V

 are unknown. 

Null Line Element 

An  exact  solution  for  the  metric  components  can  be 

obtained by requiring that the metric produce the null line 

element of light.  Assuming for example the null proper time 

interval of a photon moving in the   direction, 

 

 

 

0 = −V 2dt 2 + U 2dz 2.

Now  recalling  that  U =

  leads  to  an  equation  for  the 

metric components, 

 

 

 

0 = −V 2dt 2 +

dz 2 .   

 

 

 

 (19) 

This equation can be rearranged and solved for the velocity,

Here we will look for solutions in which the acceleration is 

a constant.  This is equivalent to looking for a coordinate 

system in which the acceleration with respect to coordinate 

time  t  is  constant.    Differentiating  the  velocity  with 

respect to time t and setting

The  constants  ν,  µ,  α  can  be  determined  by  requiring  that 

the  metric  goes  to  (-1,1,1,1)  if  the  acceleration  goes  to 

zero (i.e.

setting

This metric is similar to the Schwarzschild metric [Weinberg 

p. 180] in being time independent and only dependent on one 

 

spatial dimension. 

Conformally Flat Condition 

The relationship between the metric components can also 

be  established  by  requiring  that  the  metric  be  conformally 

flat.  The development of this relationship closely follows 

Tilbrook [Tilbrook].  This restriction assumes the existence 

of a diffeomorfism or coordinate transformation of the form

where  the  prime  coordinates  are  a  Minkowski  space.    With 

this  coordinate  transformation  the  differentials  of  the

Harmonic Coordinate Condition 
 

The assumption of conformal flatness does not uniquely 

determine  the  components  of  the  metric  since  both  U   and 

V

are  unknown  in  the  differential  equations.    This  is  the 

same  situation  and  indeed  the  same  differential  equation 

that was found from the solution of the field equations.  In 

order to completely solve for the metric a coordinate system 

that satisfies the harmonic coordinate conditions (HCC) can 

be chosen.  The harmonic coordinate conditions are obtained 

by  setting  the  contraction  of  the  Christoffel  symbols  with 

the metric tensor to zero,

d 2ξ
dt 2 = 0.    This  is  the  same 

property  as  a  photon  in  a  special  relativistic  coordinate 

system moving with a constant velocity.  The HHC provides a 

non-accelerating  coordinate  system  moving  in  the  z  

direction which can be assume to have the same instantaneous 

velocity  as  the  accelerated  coordinate  system  and  to  be  a 

momentarily comoving frame (MCMF). 

Having identified the harmonic coordinate system (HCS) 

as  a  momentarily  comoving  reference  frame  the  coordinate 

transformation  to  an  accelerated  coordinate  system  can  be 

found by requiring that the coordinates be accelerated with 

constant acceleration with respect to the HCS.  First assume

The  fact  that  the  line  element  for  the  accelerated 

coordinate  system  can  be  obtained  by  applying  this 

transformation to the line element of the MCMF is consistent 

with the assumption that the coordinate system is uniformly 

accelerated. 

 

 

Conclusion 

 

The  metric  for  a  constantly  accelerated  system  or 

equivalently  a  uniform  gravitational  field  has  been 

calculated  exactly.    First  by  solving  the  field  equations 

and  requiring  that  the  metric  produce  the  correct  null 

interval  for  photons.    Second  by  assuming  that  the 

accelerated  coordinate  system  is  conformally  flat  and 

applying the harmonic coordinate conditions.  This produces 

the  metric  of  a  coordinate  system  that  has  a  simple 

coordinate  transformation  to  a  uniformly  accelerated 

coordinate  system  and  can  be  considered  a  MCMF.    These 

parallel solutions for the metric of a uniformly accelerated 

coordinate  system  provide  an  analytic  demonstration  of  the 

equivalence principle.

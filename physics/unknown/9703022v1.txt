EXPLICIT BRACKET IN THE EXCEPTIONAL SIMPLE
LIE SUPERALGEBRA cvect(0|3)∗

IRINA SHCHEPOCHKINA AND GERHARD POST

Abstract. This note is devoted to a more detailed description of one of
the ﬁve simple exceptional Lie superalgebras of vector ﬁelds, cvect(0|3)∗,
a subalgebra of vect(4|3). We derive diﬀerential equations for its ele-
ments, and solve these equations. Hence we get an exact form for the
elements of cvect(0|3)∗. Moreover we realize cvect(0|3)∗ by ”glued” pairs
of generating functions on a (3|3)-dimensional periplectic (odd symplec-
tic) supermanifold and describe the bracket explicitly.

Introduction
V. Kac [3] classiﬁed simple ﬁnite-dimensional Lie superalgebras over C.
Kac further conjectured [3] that passing to inﬁnite-dimensional simple Lie
superalgebras of vector ﬁelds with polynomial coeﬃcients we only acquire
the straightforward analogues of the four well-known Cartan series: vect(n),
svect(n), h(2n) and k(2n+1) (of all, divergence-free, Hamiltonian and contact
vector ﬁelds, respectively, realized on the space of dimension indicated).

It soon became clear [4], [1], [5], [6] that the actual list of simple vectoral

Lie superalgebras is much larger. Several new series were found.

Next, exceptional vectoral algebras were discovered [8], [9]; for their de-
tailed description see [10], [2]. All of them are obtained with the help of a
Cartan prolongation or a generalized prolongation, cf. [8]. This description
is, however, not always satisfactory; a more succinct presentation (similar
to the one via generating functions for the elements of h and k) and a more
explicit formula for their brackets is desirable.

The purpose of this note is to give a more lucid description of one of
these exceptions, cvect(0|3)∗. In particular we oﬀer a multiplication table
for cvect(0|3)∗ that is simpler than previous descriptions, by use of ”glued”
pairs of generating functions for the elements of cvect(0|3)∗.

This note can be seen as a supplement to [10]. To be self-contained and

to ﬁx notations we introduce some basic notions in section 0.

Throughout, the ground ﬁeld is C.

§0. Background
0.1. We recall that a superspace V is a Z/2-graded space; V = V¯0 ⊕ V¯1.
The elements of V¯0 are called even, those of V¯1 odd. When considering an
element x ∈ V , we will always assume that x is homogeneous, i.e. x ∈ V¯0
or x ∈ V¯1. We write p(x) = ¯i if x ∈ V¯i. The superdimension of V is (n|m),
where n = dim(V¯0) and m = dim(V¯1).

For a superspace V , we denote by Π(V ) the same superspace with the

shifted parity, i.e., Π(V¯i) = V¯i+¯1.

0.2. Let x = (u1, . . . , un, ξ1, . . . , ξm), where u1, . . . , un are even indetermi-
nates and ξ1, . . . , ξm odd indeterminates. In the associative algebra C[x] we
have that x · y = (−1)p(x)p(y)y · x (by deﬁnition) and hence ξ2
i = 0 for all i.
The derivations der(C[x]) of C[x] form a Lie superalgebra; its elements are
vector ﬁelds. These polynomial vector ﬁelds are denoted by vect(n|m). Its
elements are represented as

D =

fi

∂
∂ui

+

Xi

Xj

gj

∂
∂ξj

where fi ∈ C[x] and gj ∈ C[x] for all i, j = 1..n. We have p(D) = p(fi) =
p(gj) + ¯1 and the Lie product is given by the commutator
[D1, D2] = D1D2 − (−1)p(D1)p(D2)D2D1.

On the vector ﬁelds we have a map, div : vect(n|m) → C[x], deﬁned by

divD = div(

Xi=1

.

A vector ﬁeld D that satisﬁes divD = 0 is called special. The linear space
of special vector ﬁelds in vect(n|m) forms a Lie superalgebra, denoted by
svect(n|m).

0.3. Next we discuss the Lie superalgebra of Leitesian vector ﬁelds le(n).
It consists of the elements D ∈ vect(n|n) that annihilate the 2-form ω =
i duidξi. Hence le(n) is an odd superanalogon of the Hamiltonian vector
i dpidqi). Similar to the Hamiltonian case, there

ﬁelds (in which case ω =
P
is a map Le : C[x] → le(n), with x = (u1, . . . , un, ξ1, . . . , ξn):

P

Xi=1

Lef =

(

∂f
∂ui

∂
∂ξi

+ (−1)p(f ) ∂f
∂ξi

∂
∂ui

)

Note that Le maps odd elements of C[x] to even elements of le(n) and vice
versa. Moreover Ker(Le) = C. We turn C[x] (with shifted parity) into a Lie
superalgebra with (Buttin) bracket {f, g} deﬁned by

A straightforward calculation shows that

Le{f,g} = [Lef , Leg]

{f, g} =

n

Xi=1

(

∂f
∂ui

∂g
∂ξi

+ (−1)p(f ) ∂f
∂ξi

∂g
∂ui

).

This way ΠC[x]/C · 1 is a Lie superalgebra isomorphic to le(n). We call f
the generating function of Lef . Here and throughout p(f ) will denote the

EXPLICIT BRACKET IN AN EXCEPTIONAL LIE SUPERALGEBRA

parity in C[x], not in ΠC[x]. So p(f ) is the parity of the number of ξ in a
term of f .

0.4. The algebra le(n) contains certain important subalgebras. First of all
there is sle(n), the space of special Leitesian vector ﬁelds:

sle(n) = le(n) ∩ svect(n|n).
We have seen that if D ∈ le(n) then D = Lef for some f ∈ C[x]. Now
D ∈ sle(n) iﬀ f is harmonic in the following sense

∆(f ) :=

n

Xi=1

∂2f
∂ui∂ξi

= 0

Usually we simply say f ∈ sle(n), identifying f and Lef . This ∆ satisﬁes
the condition ∆2 = 0 and hence ∆ : le(n) → sle(n). The image ∆(le(n)) =:
sle◦(n) is an ideal of codimension 1 on sle(n). This ideal, sle◦(n), can also
be deﬁned by the exact sequence

0 −→ sle◦(n) −→ sle(n) −→ C · Leξ1...ξn −→ 0.

Note that if Φ =

uiξi and f ∈ sle(n), then

P

∆(Φf ) = (n + degu f − degξ f ) · f
Let ν(f ) = n + degu f − degξ f . Then ν(f ) 6= 0 iﬀ f ∈ sle◦(n). So on sle◦(n)
we can deﬁne the right inverse ∆−1 to ∆ by the formula

∆−1f =

(Φf ).

0.5. Cartan prolongs. We will repeatedly use Cartan prolongation. So
let us recall the deﬁnition. Let g be a Lie superalgebra and V a g-module.
Set g−1 = V , g0 = g and for i > 0 deﬁne the i-th Cartan prolong gi as the
space of all X ∈ Hom(g−1, gi−1) such that

X(w0)(w1, w2, . . . , wi) = (−1)p(w0)p(w1)X(w1)(w0, w2, . . . , wi)

for all w0, . . . , wi ∈ g−1.

is (g−1, g0)∗ = ⊕i≥−1gi.

The Cartan prolong (the result of Cartan’s prolongation) of the pair (V, g)

Suppose that the g0-module g−1 is faithful. Then

(g−1, g0)∗ ⊂ vect(n|m) = der(C[x]), where n = dim(V¯0) and m = dim(V¯1)
and x = (u1, . . . , un, ξ1, . . . , ξm). We have for i ≥ 1

gi = {D ∈ vect(n|m) : deg D = i, [D, X] ∈ gi−1 for any X ∈ g−1}.

The Lie superalgebra structure on vect(n|m) induces one on (g−1, g0)∗. This
way the commutator of vector ﬁelds [g, v], corresponds to the action g · v,
g ∈ g and v ∈ V .

We give some examples of Cartan prolongations. Let g−1 = V be an
(n|m)-dimensional superspace and g0 = gl(n|m) the space of all endomor-
phisms of V . Then (g−1, g0)∗ = vect(n|m).
If one takes for g0 only the
supertraceless elements sl(n|m), then (g−1, g0)∗ = svect(n|m), the algebra
of vector ﬁelds with divergence 0.

§1. The structure of vect(0|3)∗

1.1. In this note our primary interest is in a certain Cartan prolongation
(denoted by vect(0|3)∗) and the extension cvect(0|3)∗ thereof. Here we will
discuss vect(0|3)∗. Now vect(0|3)∗ is a short-hand notation for the Cartan
prolongation with

V = g−1 = ΠΛ(η1, η2, η3)/C and g0 = derV

So V is a superspace of dimension (4|3), with

V¯0 = hη1η2η3, η1, η2, η3i;

V¯1 = hη2η3, η3η1, η1η2i

and dim g0 = (12|12).

Choosing

The elements of g−1 and g0 can be expressed as vector ﬁelds in vect(4|3).

η1η2η3 ≃ −∂y;

ηi ≃ −∂ui;

∂η1η2η3
∂ηi

≃ −∂ξi.

it is subject to straightforward veriﬁcation that the elements of g0, expressed
as elements of vect(4|3) are of the form:

∂η1 ≃ −y∂ξ1 − ξ2∂u3 + ξ3∂u2
∂η2 ≃ −y∂ξ2 − ξ3∂u1 + ξ1∂u3
∂η3 ≃ −y∂ξ3 − ξ1∂u2 + ξ2∂u1

−η1∂η1 ≃ u1∂u1 + ξ2∂ξ2 + ξ3∂ξ3 + y∂y
−η2∂η2 ≃ u2∂u2 + ξ1∂ξ1 + ξ3∂ξ3 + y∂y
−η3∂η3 ≃ u3∂u3 + ξ1∂ξ1 + ξ2∂ξ2 + y∂y

η1∂η2 ≃ −u2∂u1 + ξ1∂ξ2
η2∂η3 ≃ −u3∂u2 + ξ2∂ξ3
η3∂η1 ≃ −u1∂u3 + ξ3∂ξ1

η2∂η1 ≃ −u1∂u2 + ξ2∂ξ1
η3∂η2 ≃ −u2∂u3 + ξ3∂ξ2
η1∂η3 ≃ −u3∂u1 + ξ1∂ξ3

η1η2η3∂η1 ≃ −u1∂y
η1η2η3∂η2 ≃ −u2∂y
η1η2η3∂η3 ≃ −u3∂y

η1η2∂η3 ≃ −u3∂ξ3
η2η3∂η1 ≃ −u1∂ξ1
η3η1∂η2 ≃ −u2∂ξ2

η1η2∂η1 ≃ −u1∂ξ3 − ξ2∂y
η2η3∂η2 ≃ −u2∂ξ1 − ξ3∂y
η3η1∂η3 ≃ −u3∂ξ2 − ξ1∂y

η1η2∂η2 ≃ −u2∂ξ3 + ξ1∂y
η2η3∂η3 ≃ −u3∂ξ1 + ξ2∂y
η3η1∂η1 ≃ −u1∂ξ2 + ξ3∂y

1.2. Now we will give a more explicit description of vect(0|3)∗. It will turn
out that vect(0|3)∗ is isomorphic to le(3) as Lie superalgebra; however con-
sidered as Z-graded algebras we have to deﬁne a diﬀerent grading. The
Z-graded Lie superalgebra le(3; 3) is le(3) as Lie superalgebra with Z-degree

the u-degree of fi minus 1 (or the u-degree of gj), i.e. deg ξi = 0.

d.) If f = ψ(u)ξ1ξ2ξ3 then

i1(Lef ) = −ψ(u)∂y.

Note that i1 preserves the Z-degree. We have the following lemma.
1.3. Lemma. The map i1 is an isomorphism of Z-graded Lie superalgebras
between le(3; 3) and vect(0|3)∗ ⊂ vect(4|3).

Proof. That i1 is an embedding can be veriﬁed by direct computation. To
prove that the image of i1 is in vect(0|3)∗ it is enough to show that this is
the case on the components le(3; 3)−1 ⊕ le(3; 3)0, i.e. on functions f (u, ξ) of
degree ≤ 1 with respect to u, as the Cartan prolongation is the biggest sub-
algebra g of vect(4|3), with given g−1 and g0. The proof that i1 is surjective
onto vect(0|3)∗ is given in corollary 4.6.

A generalized version of Lemma 1.3 can be found in [10] and [7]. It states
that le(n; n) and vect(0|n)∗ are isomorphic for all n ≥ 1.

§2. The construction of cvect(0|3)∗

2.1. Let us describe a general construction, which leads to several new sim-
ple Lie superalgebras. Let u = vect(m|n), let g = (u−1, g0)∗ be a simple Lie
subsuperalgebra of u. Moreover suppose there exists an element d ∈ u0 that
determines an exterior derivation of g and has no kernel on u+. Let us study
the prolong ˜g = (g−1, g0 ⊕ Cd)∗.
Lemma. Either ˜g is simple or ˜g = g ⊕ Cd.

Proof. Let I be a nonzero graded ideal of ˜g. The subsuperspace (ad u−1)k+1a
of u−1 is nonzero for any nonzero homogeneous element a ∈ uk and k ≥
0. Since g−1 = u−1, the ideal I contains nonzero elements from g−1; by
simplicity of g the ideal I contains the whole g. If, moreover, [g−1, ˜g1] = g0,
then by deﬁnition of the Cartan prolongation ˜g = g ⊕ Cd.

If, instead, [g−1, ˜g1] = g0 ⊕ Cd, then d ∈ I and since [d, u+] = u+, we

derive that I = ˜g. In other words, ˜g is simple.

As an example, take g = svect(m|n); g0 = sl(m|n), d = 1m|n. Then

(g−1, g0 ⊕ Cd)∗ = vect(m|n).

2.2. Deﬁnition. The Lie superalgebra cvect(0|3)∗ ⊂ vect(4|3) is the Cartan
prolongation with cvect(0|3)−1 = vect(0|3)−1 and cvect(0|3)0 = vect(0|3)0 ⊕
Cd, with

If now

then it is clear that f ∈ vect(0|3) ⊕ Cd, but f 6∈ vect(0|3).

2.3. Theorem. The Lie superalgebra cvect(0|3)∗ is simple.
Proof. We know that vect(0|3)∗ ∼= le(3; 3) is simple. According to Lemma 2.1
it is suﬃcient to ﬁnd an element F ∈ cvect(0|3)1, which is not in vect(0|3)1.
For F one can take

F = yξ1∂ξ1 + yξ2∂ξ2 + yξ3∂ξ3 + y2∂y − ξ1ξ2∂u3 − ξ3ξ1∂u2 − ξ2ξ3∂u1

Indeed, one easily checks that ∂yF = f , while

[∂ξi, F ] = −∂ηi

(i = 1, 2, 3),

and moreover [∂ui, F ] = 0. This proves the claim.

Similar constructions are possible for general n. For n = 2 we obtain
cvect(0|2)∗ ∼= vect(2|1), while for n > 3 one can prove that cvect(0|n)∗ is
not simple. For details, we refer to [10].

2.4. Lemma. A vector ﬁeld

Proof. Denote by g = ⊕i≥−1gi the superspace of solutions of the system
(2.1)–(2.6). Clearly, g−1 ∼= vect(4|3)−1. We directly verify that the images of
the elements from vect(0|3) ⊕ Cd satisfy (2.1)–(2.6). Actually, we composed
the system of equations (2.1)–(2.6) by looking at these images.

The isomorphism g0 = vect(0|3) ⊕ Cd follows from dimension considera-

tions.

The operators Duj , Dy and ˜Dξj , clearly, commute with the g−1-action. Ob-
serve: the operators commute, not super commute.

Since the operators in the equations (2.1)–(2.6) are linear combinations of
only these operators Duj , Dy and ˜Dξj , the deﬁnition of Cartan prolongation
itself ensures isomorphism of g with cvect(0|3)∗.

2.6. Remark. Lemma 2.4 illustrates how cvect(0|3)∗ can be characterized
by a set of ﬁrst order, constant coeﬃcient, diﬀerential operators. This is a
general fact of Cartan prolongations; one just replaces the linear constraints
on g0 by such operators. For example, for vect(0|3)∗ we have the equations

Let us return now to the system (2.1) – (2.6). Equations (2.3), (2.5), (2.6)

§4 How to generate cvect(0|3)∗ by pairs of functions
We constructed cvect(0|3)∗ as an extension of vect(0|3)∗ ∼= le(3; 3), see
lemma 1.3. Using the results of section 3, we obtain another embedding
i2 : le(3) → vect(0|3)∗.

4.1. Lemma. The map

i2 : Lef → Lef + yAf − (−1)p(f )

y∆(f ) + y2D3

∂y

(4.1)

determines an embedding of le(3) into cvect(0|3)∗. This embedding preserves
the standard grading of le(3).

(cid:0)

(cid:1)

Proof. We have to verify the equality

i2(Le{f,g}) = [i2(Lef ), i2(Leg)].

Comparison of coeﬃcients of diﬀerent powers of y shows that the above
equation is equivalent to the following system:

Le{f,g} = [Lef , Leg].

A{f,g} = [Lef , Ag] + [Af , Leg] − (−1)p(f )(∆(f ) · Ag + (−1)p(f )p(g)∆(g)Af ).

Equation (4.2) is known, see section 0.3. The equalities (4.3)–(4.6) are
subject to direct veriﬁcation.

We found two embeddings i1 :
cvect(0|3)∗. Let us denote

le(3; 3) → vect(0|3)∗ and i2 :

le(3) →

αg = Ag − (−1)p(g)(∆g + 2yD3

ξ g)∂y.

We want to prove that the sum of the images of i1 and i2 cover the whole
cvect(0|3)∗. According to Theorem 3.1, it is suﬃcient to represent αg in the
form αg = i1g1 + i2g2. For convenience we simply write f instead of Lef .

4.2. Lemma. For αg we have:

4.3. A wonderful property of sle◦(3). In the standard grading of g =
sle◦(3) we have: dim g−1 = (3|3), g0 ∼= spe(3). For the regraded superalgebra
Rg = sle◦(3; 3) ⊂ le(3; 3) we have: dim Rg−1 = (3|3), Rg0 = svect(0|3) ∼=
spe(3). For the deﬁnition of spe(3) we refer to [3] or [10]. Therefore, for
sle◦(3) and only for it among the sle◦(n), the regrading R determines a
nontrivial automorphism. In terms of generating functions the regrading is
determined by the formulas:

1) degξ(f ) = 0: R(f ) = ∆(f ξ1ξ2ξ3);
2) degξ(f ) = 1: R(f ) = f ;
3) degξ(f ) = 2: R(f ) = D3

ξ (∆−1f ).

Note that R2(f ) = (−1)p(f )+1f . Now we can formulate the following propo-
sition.

4.4. Proposition. The nondirect sum of the images of i1 and i2 covers the
whole cvect(0|3)∗, i.e.,

i1(le(3; 3)) + i2(le(3)) = (cvect(0|3))∗.

We also have

i1(le(3; 3)) ∩ i2(le(3)) ∼= sle◦(3; 3) ∼= sle◦(3).
Proof. The ﬁrst part follows from Lemma 4.2. The second part follows by
direct calculation from solving i2(Lef ) = i1(Leg). Note that Lef ∈ sle◦(3)
ξ f = 0, and similar for Leg ∈ sle◦(3; 3). The equation
iﬀ ∆(f ) = 0 and D3
i2(Lef ) = i1(Leg) is only solvable if f ∈ sle◦(3) and g ∈ sle◦(3; 3), and in
this case we obtain g = (−1)p(f )+1Rf .

Therefore, we can identify the space of the Lie superalgebra cvect(0|3)∗ with
the quotient space of le(3; 3) ⊕ le(3) modulo

{(−1)p(g)+1Rg ⊕ (−g), g ∈ sle◦(3)}.
In other words, we can represent the elements of cvect(0|3)∗ in the form of
the pairs of functions

(f, g), where

f, g ∈ ΠC[u, ξ]/C · 1

(4.7)

subject to identiﬁcations

(−1)p(g)+1(Rg, 0) ∼ (0, g)

for any g ∈ sle◦(3).

4.5. Corollary. The map ϕ deﬁned by the formula
ϕ|i1(le(3;3)) = sign i2i−1
1 ;

ϕ|i2(le(3)) = i1i−1
2

is an automorphism of cvect(0|3)∗. Here sign(D) = (−1)p(D)D.

The map ϕ may be represented in inner coordinates of vect(4|3) as a

regrading by setting deg y = −1; deg ui = 1; deg ξi = 0.

In the representation (4.7) we have

ϕ(f, g) = (g, (−1)p(f )+1f ).

Now we can complete the proof of Lemma 1.3.

4.6. Corollary. The embedding i1 : le(3) → cvect(0|3)∗ is a surjection onto
vect(0|3)∗.

12

IRINA SHCHEPOCHKINA AND GERHARD POST

Proof. By Proposition 4.4 we merely have to prove that i2(Lef ) ∈ vect(0|3)∗
iﬀ ∆f = 0 and D3
ξ f = 0. Applying equation (2.7) to i2(Lef ), this follows
immediately.

§5 The bracket in cvect(0|3)∗

Now we can determine the bracket in cvect(0|3)∗ in terms of representation

(f, g) as stated in formula (4.7).

We do this via αg. By Theorem 3.1 any D ∈ cvect(0|3)∗ is of the form
D = i2(f ) + αg for some generating functions f and g. To determine the
bracket [i2(f ), i1(h)], we

1. Compute the brackets [i2f, αg] for any f, g ∈ C[u, ξ]/C · 1;
2. Represent i1(h) in the form

i1(h) = i2a(h) + αb(h) for any h ∈ C[u, ξ]/C · 1;

(5.1)

In Lemma 4.2 we expressed αg in i1 and i2.

Remark. The functions a(h) and b(h) above are not uniquely deﬁned. Any
representation will do.

5.1. Lemma. For any functions f, g ∈ C[u, ξ]/C · 1 the bracket [i2f, αg] is
of the form

[i2f, αg] = i2F + αG,

(5.2)

where

F = f · D3

ξ g − (−1)(p(f )+1)(p(g)+1)Agf

and G = −f ∆g

Proof. Direct calculation gives that

[i2f, αg] = [Lef , Ag] + (−1)p(f )p(g)+p(f )+1∆g · Af
[Af , Ag] + (−1)p(f )p(g)+p(f )+1 · 2 · D3

(cid:17)

In order to ﬁnd the functions F and G, it suﬃces to observe that the co-
eﬃcient of ∂y, non-divisible by y, should be equal to (−1)p(G)+1∆G. This
implies the equations:

(−1)p(G)+1∆G = (−1)p(g)+1

{f, ∆g} + (−1)p(f )∆f · ∆g
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

or

(−1)p(G)+1∆G = (−1)p(f )+p(g)+1∆(f · ∆g).
Here p(G) = p(f · ∆g) = p(f ) + p(g) + 1. Hence, ∆G = ∆(−f ∆g). Since G
is deﬁned up to elements from sle◦(3), we can take G = −f ∆g.
The function F to be found is determined from the equation

i2F = [i2f, αg] − αG.

By comparing the coeﬃcients of y∂y in the left and right hand sides of (5.3)
we get

By comparing parities we derive that

Observe that

Then

It follows that

∆F = (−1)p(f )Af (∆g) + (−1)p(f )p(g)+p(f )+1Ag(∆f ).

only remains to compare the elements of the same degree in y in the right-

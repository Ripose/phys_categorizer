CROSSTALK BETWEEN BEAM-BEAM EFFECTS AND LATTICE
NONLINEARITIES IN DAΦNE

M. Zobov

1.  Introduction

Recently a dynamic tracking system [1] has been implemented in the DAΦNE main
rings.  Among  many  useful  data  provided  by  the  system  it  also  allows  to  measure  a
horizontal machine cubic nonlinearity, i. e. the tune dependence on transverse oscillation
amplitude.

During tune up for collisions it has been found that the cubic nonlinearity can vary in a
wide range depending on the lattice optical functions and on the orbit. Moreover, the sign of
the  nonlinearity  can  even  change,  for  example,  when  wigglers  are  switched  off.  This  is
explained by a strong octupole term in the wigglers [2].

Besides, we have noted correlations between the nonlinearity strength and sign and the
attainable luminosity. In particular, the best single bunch luminosity of 1030 cm-2s-1 has been
achieved with currents of about 20 mA per bunch in the lattice having the weakest negative
cubic  nonlinearity.  Instead,  when  the  wigglers  were  switched  off,  we  could  not  collide
bunches  with  currents  higher  than  4-5  mA  without  beam-beam  blow  up  and  lifetime
degradation.  This  can  not  be  explained  completely  only  by  weaker  noise  and  longer
damping time.

Yet another observation is that while trying to increase the luminosity by increasing the
number of bunches per beam, parasitic crossings limit the maximum achievable luminosity
per bunch even for the bunch pattern with alternated empty and full buckets. This is not
confirmed by simulations if nonlinearities are not taken in account.

We  have  undertaken  this  study  to  explain  the  experimental  observations  in  order  to
understand and overcome present luminosity limitations. In Section 2 we summarize the
results of the cubic nonlinearity measurements in DAΦNE. Section 3 gives a qualitative
discussion on consequences of the crosstalk between beam-beam effects and nonlinearities,
while numerical simulations of the beam-beam blow up and tail growth taking into account
the  measured  cubic  nonlinearities  are  described  in  Section  4.  Section  5  is  devoted  to
modeling of beam-beam interaction with parasitic crossings and cubic nonlinearities. The
main  results  of  the  study  and  proposals  for  luminosity  improvement  are  listed  in  the
Conclusions.

2.  Cubic nonlinearities in DAΦNE

The effects of machine nonlinearity on particle motion are investigated using a dynamic
tracking  system  recently  implemented  in  the  DAΦNE  main  rings  [1].  A  single  bunch  is
excited horizontally by pulsing one of the injection kickers. The dynamic tracking system
allows to store and to analyze turn-by-turn the position of the kicked bunch. The coherent
betatron  oscillation  amplitude  is  recorded  over  2048  turns  providing  information  on
trajectories in phase space and betatron tune shifts with amplitude.

Analysis  of  the  coherent  oscillation  amplitude  decay  due  to  nonlinear  filamentation
gives  a  possibility  to  estimate  directly  a  cubic  nonlinearity.  The  decoherence  signal
envelope at small currents is found to decay with time t in the following way [3]:

As it is seen from eq. (1), the signal provides a rich information on lattice parameters.

amplitude ∆x and the horizontal beam size σx are taken at the pick up position. Besides, if
the chromaticity  ∂ω ∂x E/
 does not vanish and is measured by other means, one can define
the angular synchrotron frequency Ωs and the energy spread σE. Vice versa, if the energy
spread is known, the chromaticity can be inferred from the signal. When the chromaticity is
compensated, the decoherence signal decays purely exponentially. An example of such a
signal measured by the DAΦNE dynamic tracking system is shown in Fig. 1.

Often,  the  dependence  of  the  betatron  tune  shift  on  amplitude  due  to  the  cubic

nonlinearity is written as:

with the coefficient c11 characterizing the strength of the nonlinearity:

and Jx the action variable related to the oscillation amplitude as:

where βx is the horizontal beta function and ω0 the angular revolution frequency. Now it is
easy to show that the coefficient c11 is found directly from the signal envelope by fitting it
by the exponential function.

For  finite  currents  the  sign  of  the  cubic  nonlinearity  is  of  a  great  importance  [4,  5].

As we can see in Table 2, c11 varies in a very wide range. Moreover, it even changes
sign  when  the  wigglers  are  switched  off.  For  a  comparison,  Fig.  2  shows  decoherence
signals for the lattices with the wigglers on (negative c11) and the wigglers off (positive c11).
As predicted by the theory, decoherence is absent in the lattice with positive nonlinearity.

Briefly summarizing the experimental observations and measurements we can say that:

1.  The highest negative contribution to c11 comes from the wigglers and it depends strongly
on beta functions. That is why, in comparison with the “old KLOE lattice”, the detuned
lattice [7] with lower beta functions at the wiggler positions has weaker negative cubic
nonlinearity. And, besides, c11 gets positive when the wigglers are completely switched
off.

2.  For most settings the sextupoles give also negative contribution to c11, but usually it is
substantially  smaller  than  that  of  the  wiggler.  For  example,  compare  in  Table  2  the
lattices with wigglers off with sextupoles on and off.

G-57  pg. 5

3.  By measuring the tune dependence on the localized bumps in the IP2 region, it has been
found  that  the  “C”  correctors  on  both  sides  of  the  IR  can  introduce  sextupolar
components [8]. From this point of view, the detuned structure is preferable, since it
allows  to  create  a  large  separation  at  the  second  IP  with  small  currents  in  the  “C”
correctors.

4.  We  attribute  the  positive  contribution  to  the  cubic  nonlinearity  to  fringing  fields  in

quadrupole magnets. But, their strengths are to be checked quantitatively.

3.  Discussion on crosstalk between cubic nonlinearities and beam-beam effects.

It was noted more than 15 years ago that lattice nonlinearities can affect significantly
beam-beam  collider  performance  [9].  The  effect  of  the  cubic  machine  nonlinearity
considering the resonance  10
 as an example was studied numerically showing that
positive nonlinearity can substantially enlarge the beam-beam resonance width [10]. Later,
Temnykh  [11]  made  experimental  observations  at  VEPP-4  on  the  influence  of  cubic
nonlinearities  on  the  resonances  induced  by  beam-beam  interaction.  By  measuring  the
particle loss rate during a betatron tune scan it was found that it increased strongly while
crossing the horizontal beam-beam resonance  7
 if the horizontal cubic nonlinearity
was  positive.  This  observation  is  consistent  with  the  analytical  prediction  of  [9]  and  the
numerical result of [10].

νx =

G-57  pg. 6

On  the  other  hand,  according  to  VEPP-2M  experience,  a  positive  cubic  nonlinearity

was preferable for collider luminosity operation [12].

Let us briefly discuss why the results are so different. There are two main contradicting
consequences  of  the  crosstalk  between  lattice  nonlinearities  and  the  beam-beam
nonlinearities:

1)  The betatron tune shift due to beam-beam interaction is positive. The core of colliding
bunch  experiences  the  highest  tune  shift,  while  the  bunch  distribution  tails  do  not
almost change their betatron tunes. Instead, the lattice nonlinearities do not affect the
bunch core, but can change considerably the tune of particles in the tails.
In this sense, the negative nonlinearity adds to beam-beam nonlinearity thus enlarging
the beam-beam footprint on the tune diagram. In this case the number of resonances
crossing the footprint is higher, especially in the tails. One might expect degradation in
the  collider  performance  for  negative  nonlinearity.  A  positive  nonlinearity  tends  to
compensate partially the footprint.

2)  However, the parameters of beam-beam resonances change in a different manner for
positive  and  negative  nonlinearities.  Consider  an  isolated  resonance  described  by  a
truncated Hamiltonian as [13]:

where  all  values  are  taken  at  the  oscillation  amplitude  (corresponding  to  the  action

the beam-beam interaction the detuning term can be written as:

Since  the  double  derivative  of  the  detuning  term  determined  by  the  beam-beam
interaction ′′αbb   is  negative,  the  following  changes  in  beam-beam  resonances  due  to  the
cubic nonlinearity are possible (see eq. (8) and (9)):

if c11 < 0, the resonances are located at smaller amplitude, 
resonance width gets smaller.

From this point of view, the negative sign of the nonlinearity is preferable being less

harmful to collider performance.

Therefore,  it  is  difficult  to  say  a  priori  what  kind  of  cubic  nonlinearity,  positive  or
negative,  is  less  harmful  in  the  presence  of  beam-beam  effects.  Which  one  of  these  two
consequences, 1) or 2), prevails in real working conditions depends much on the collider
working points, beam-beam tune shifts, nonlinearity strength and sign. This is why it would
be very useful to have in DAΦNE additional octupoles to vary the cubic nonlinearity in a
wide range in order to optimize experimentally beam-beam performance.

However, there is another point in favor of the negative nonlinearity: it gives a strong

decoherence of coherent oscillations, while decoherence is prohibited for the positive one.

4.  Single bunch luminosity limitation due to cubic nonlinearity.

Now,  when  the  cubic  nonlinearity  has  been  measured,  we  perform  beam-beam
simulations taking into account the nonlinearity in order to understand its impact on beam
blow up and lifetime.

We  use  the  weak-strong  code  LIFETRAC  [14]  that  allows  including  implicitly  the
cubic  nonlinearity  coefficient  c11  in  the  simulations.  It  is  assumed  that  the  tune  shift
  and  the  working  point  is  at
parameters are equal in both transverse planes ξ
(0.15; 0.21). The coefficient c11 is varied in the range – 600 < c11 < + 600 corresponding to
the measured c11 as given in Table 2.

betatron amplitudes are shown in Fig. 3. Table 3 summarizes the main results as a function
of different c11: the beam blow up in the horizontal and vertical planes is reported in the
second and the third rows respectively, and the lifetime is given in the last raw. We should

As  it  is  seen  in  Fig.  3,  both  positive  and  negative  nonlinearities  are  harmful  for  the
beam-beam effects. Above | c11| > 200 the distribution tails start growing and the bunch core
blows  up  in  both  cases.  So,  it  is  hard  to  say  which  sign  of  the  nonlinearity  is  more
preferable. For positive c11 the horizontal tails reach the horizontal dynamic aperture and the
horizontal  size  is  blown  up,  while  for  negative  c11  the  tails  expand  in  both  transverse
directions and the bunch blows up vertically.

According to the simulations, the nonlinearity strength can be considered acceptable
when c11 remains within the range – 200 < c11 < + 200. As shown in Fig. 3, for this range the
tails are well confined inside the dynamic aperture and blow up is negligible. This agrees
well with experimental observations: the highest single bunch luminosity of 1030 cm-2s-1 was
reached in a reliable way when both collider rings were adjusted to the working point (0.15;
0.21) and the measured c11 was equal to – 170 (see the first detuned structure in Table 2).

Instead, during collisions in the KLOE IP in November – December 2000 the measured
c11 was about – 600 and the maximum achievable single bunch luminosity was at a level of
5-6x1029 cm-2s-1. At it is seen in the first column of Table 3, such a strong cubic nonlinearity
leads to both beam-beam blow up and lifetime reduction.

In the present collider configuration, the electron ring has c11 = - 300 and the positron
one has c11  = - 350. The nonlinearity is higher for this configuration due to the increase of
the  beta  functions  in  the  wigglers,  giving  a  strong  negative  octupole  term.  This  was
necessary to cope with background problems. However, c11 values of the order of –300 are
still  acceptable  giving  relatively  small  blow  up  and  moderate  tail  growth.  The  measured
single bunch luminosity in this case is about 8x1029 cm-2s-1. Therefore, the present lattice can
be considered as a reasonable compromise between beam-beam performance and allowable
background level. From this point of view, beam-beam and background problems can be
separated  if  we  use  an  independent  (and  variable)  source  of  the  cubic  nonlinearity.
Additional octupoles could play this role [They will be available in fall 2001].

As we see from Table 2, the cubic nonlinearity changes its sign getting positive when
the wigglers are switched off. In the lattice configuration with wigglers off and sextupoles
on we managed to get c11 as low as + 200. The simulations indicate only 10% blow up and
no substantial tail growth. However, we could not collide bunches with currents above 4-5
mA without beam-beam blow up and lifetime degradation. This can be explained by two
reasons. First, the transverse damping time is by a factor of 3 longer, and respectively, the
noise is weaker when the wigglers are switched off. The simulations of these conditions
show that a bunch has about 30% blow up and tails reach the horizontal dynamic aperture.

G-57  pg. 9

Second, during the collisions we observed that the transverse instability thresholds reduced
drastically for positive nonlinearity. In particular, without sextupoles the head-tail threshold
current was below 1 mA, while for the lattice with wigglers on the threshold was as high as
10-13  mA.  Also  the  multibunch  instability  threshold  was  much  lower  with  wigglers  off.
Presumably, the loss of decoherence with positive nonlinearity did not allow us to collide
bunches in a stable way.

5.  Luminosity limitations due to parasitic crossings and cubic nonlinearity.

Experimentally, it was found that passing from single bunch to multibunch collisions
the luminosity does not scale linearly with the number of bunches. The best luminosity of
3.17x1031 cm-2s-1 was achieved with 47 bunches per each beam, i. e. with the luminosity of
6.75x1029  cm-2s-1 per each bunch, while the luminosity routinely obtained in single bunch
collisions is about 8-9x1029 cm-2s-1.

We  can  list  a  few  reasons  leading  to  the  luminosity  degradation  in  the  multibunch
regime. These are multibunch instabilities, ion trapping and uneven bunch fill. However, the
impact of these reasons is substantially reduced:

-  The  multibunch  instabilities  are  damped  by  feedback  systems  and  cured  by  Landau

damping due to the beam-beam interaction itself.

-   The  ion  trapping  is  avoided  by  using  a  large  enough  gap  in  the  bunch  trains  and

applying clearing electrodes.

-  The bunch fill pattern can be made even by carefully adjusting the beam injection.

In our opinion, for the present beam pattern with 47 bunches with every other bucket
filled, one of the luminosity limitations is due to parasitic crossings (PC) enhanced by the
cubic  machine  nonlinearity.  We  also  expect  that  at  currents  higher  than  those  we  use  at
present the PC effect will get much more stronger.

There are some experimental observations confirming that the PC effect is significant
for the multibunch collider performance. In particular, when injecting one of the beams out
of collision in the nearby bucket, the already stored opposite beam was killed. Yet another
observation is that it was possible to scale the luminosity with the number of bunches when
bunches  were  separated  by  4  empty  buckets.  But  the  linear  scaling  failed  when  the
separation was reduced to 2 empty buckets.

In  order  to  clarify  the  situation  we  have  simulated  with  LIFETRAC  the  beam-beam
interaction with two parasitic crossings at either side of the interaction point (IP) and taking
into account the measured cubic nonlinearity c11 = -350. The PCs were at a distance of 81
cm from the IP, which corresponds to the actual fill pattern with 1 empty bucket between
bunches. We have also considered that the coupling has been corrected down to 0.3% and

As it is clearly seen, the PCs reinforced by the nonlinearity strongly affect the bunch
tails  and,  as  a  result,  the  lifetime  drops.  So,  one  of  the  solutions  aimed  at  luminosity
improvement  in  the  multibunch  regime  is  further  reduction  of  the  collider  nonlinearity.
Installation of additional octupoles capable to control the nonlinearity would be extremely
useful.

On the other hand, increasing the bunch separation at the PC positions in terms of the
horizontal rms size can reduce the PC effect. This can be accomplished either by decreasing
the  horizontal  beta  function  at  the  PCs  or  decreasing  the  emittance.  One  can  also  try  to
increase the horizontal crossing angle.

6.  Conclusions

The  numerical  simulations  of  beam-beam  effects  taking  into  account  the  measured
cubic nonlinearities have shown that they have a dramatic impact on the collider luminosity
performance. The numerical results explain most of experimental observations made during
collisions in both single and multibunch regimes.

In  particular,  the  strong  negative  nonlinearity  accounts  for  the  low  single  bunch
luminosity  during  collisions  in  the  “old”  KLOE  lattice.  When  the  nonlinearity  was
decreased in the new detuned lattice the single bunch luminosity reached 1030 cm-2 s-1, an
improvement by a factor of 2 approximately.

G-57  pg. 11

In  the  multibunch  regime  the  maximum  achievable  luminosity  is  mainly  limited  by
parasitic  crossings  enhanced  by  the  nonlinearity,  if  other  limiting  factors,  such  as
multibunch instabilities, ion trapping and uneven fill are eliminated.

According  to  the  simulations,  in  order  to  decrease  the  nonlinearity  effects  to  an
acceptable level, its strength should be kept below | c11 | < 200. The negative nonlinearity
sign  seems  to  be  preferable,  since  collective  instabilities  are  more  pronounced  for  the
positive nonlinearity (at least, as observed experimentally).

In practice, optimization of crosstalk between beam-beam effects and nonlinearities can
be carried out by adjusting the strength and the sign of the cubic nonlinearity with additional
octupoles to be installed by next fall. In the multibunch regime the nonlinearity correction
should  be  also  accompanied  with  bunch  separation  increase  at  the  parasitic  crossing
positions.

Abstract 

     The Langevin theory of the polarization of a dilute collection of dipoles by an external 

field is often included in introductory solid state physics and physical chemistry 

curricula.  The average polarization is calculated assuming the dipoles are in thermal 

equilibrium with a heat bath.  The heart of the polarization calculation is a derivation of 

the average dipole-field projection, whose dependence on the external field is given by 

the Langevin function.   The Langevin problem is revisited, here, and the average 

projection of any given dipole onto any other dipole from the collection is derived in 

terms of the Langevin function.  A simple expression is obtained for the underlying 

dipole-dipole angular distribution function.

.1    While formulating a theory of magnetism, Langevin 

considered a collection of dipoles in an external magnetic field. 2  The concentration of 

the dipoles was assumed to be sufficiently diluted that dipole-dipole interactions could be 

neglected, leaving only the sum over the individual dipole-field potential energies for the 

total energy.  Langevin developed the equilibrium average value of the dipole projection 

on to the external field, 

cos θ  , by assuming that the dipoles were in contact with a 

(

)

heat bath.   The distribution function, which allows the equilibrium averages to be 

calculated, is the Boltzmann distribution:

      We now ask, for the same system of dipoles, what is average projection of any given 

dipole onto any other dipole from the collection.  We also ask, what is the distribution 

function for this relative projection in terms of the value of the external field?  Section II 

develops the relative angle distribution function and averages.  Section III shows the 

relative angle distribution function that is generated numerically from Monte Carlo 

calculations with some trial values of F , for comparison. 

 

 

II. Relative angle distribution and averages 

      Figure 1 shows the relative orientation of two dipoles, labeled 1 and 2.  The relative 

angle between the two dipoles is denoted byγ.   The angles that define each dipole’s 

projection onto the external Z-axis are given by θ′  and θ′′  for dipoles 1 and 2 

(cid:71)
respectively.   The Z-axis will be taken as the direction of the external field  H

, so that θ′  

and θ′′  are the angles that enter the expression for the potential energy of dipoles 1 and 2.   

3

The angle  γ∆ is given the subscriptγ because it is opposite the angle γ on the spherical 

triangle formed from the two dipoles and the Z axis, see figure 1.     θ′∆  and  θ′′∆ are 

defined likewise.    

     Because the dipoles are dilute, the average 

cosn γ  can be expressed in terms of the 

(

)

dipole-field Boltzmann distributions of the individual dipoles 1 and 2.

     To establish the distribution

(

.  The variables in equation (2) consist of two sides (arcs) of a spherical triangle and the 

intervening vertex angle (see figure 1).  The integral (2) can be re-expressed, in general, 

in terms of any two sides of the spherical triangle and their vertex angle.   So, for 

example, the following transformation is possible:

III.  Monte Carlo 

      Monte Carlo provides a way to numerically test the distribution function (7).  Monte 

Carlo numerically generates configurations of dipoles in an external field that are 

consistent with thermal equilibrium ( Bolztmann statistics ).  The input to the Monte 

Carlo calculation here is a set of 1000 dipoles with randomly assigned orientations.  Each 

Monte Carlo cycle refines the orientations of all 1000 dipoles by making random changes 

to the individual dipole orientations, one at a time.  If a given dipole’s energy 

(
V

= −

F

cos

(
)
θ

)

 is decreased or remains the same as a result of the random re-

orientation, the new orientation is kept and replaces the original orientation.  If the 

random re-orientation of a dipole leads to an increase in energy, the new orientation is not 

always accepted.    A move that increases the energy is kept with a frequency that is 

dictated by the Boltzmann weighting of the energy difference:  

(
V

new

−

V

old

)

kT

e−

.   In other 

words, larger changes in energy are accepted less frequently than smaller energy changes 

 

 

7

in manner that is consistent with thermal equilibrium.    An overview of Monte Carlo is 

available in standard texts, where sample codes are given.6, 7      A Monte Carlo 

simulation was run on a set of 1000 dipoles for each of the values:  F = 1/5, 1, 2, and 5.   

The last 400 Monte Carlo cycles out of a 5000 cycle trajectory were used to compile 

statistics of the dipole orientations for each value of  F .   Figure 2 shows normalized 

histograms of the values of 

cos θ  (figure 2, left panels) and 

cos γ  (figure 2, right 

(

)

(

)

panels) from the Monte Carlo dipole configurations.  The values of F increase from top to 

bottom. The solid lines are the Boltzmann distribution (figure 2, left panels), and the 

relative angle distribution function (7) (figure 2, right panels).   The Monte Carlo results 

numerically confirm the analytic relative angle distribution (7) derived in section II.    

IV. Discussion 

 

     A demonstration of the relative angle distribution function for dipoles in the dilute 

limit serves two purposes.  Firstly, the derivation can be used as a follow up exercise to 

the standard Langevin problem.   The calculation of the relative angle distribution is 

slightly more challenging than the calculation of the average polarization.  Furthermore, 

the problem introduces the idea of relative vs. external orientational order, which 

foreshadows the introduction of an angular distribution function in condensed phase 

statistics.   The following qualitative question might be posed, for example, to help 

explore the difference between the relative and external order:  Why, in figure 2, does the 

relative angle distribution function appear to “lag behind” the Boltzmann distribution 

function in its dependence on the external field?   

 

 

8

      Secondly, the analytical expression for the distribution function derived in the dilute 

limit (equation (7))  is useful for comparison with the angular distribution function that 

arises when dipole-dipole interactions are present at higher densities.   The general 

angular distribution function at high density reflects both the influence of the externally 

applied field, as well as dipole-dipole interactions.  The collective dipole-dipole 

interactions are not easily described by simple analytic formulae because dipoles form 

phases and exhibit long range order that involves the participation of many dipoles.7    A 

common method of grasping the structure of the dipolar phases visually is to choose a 

representative dipole and then record the angular distribution of all other dipoles that are 

at some fixed distance from the central dipole.  This procedure is repeated for multiple 

representative dipoles and distances, and statistics of the relative angle distribution are 

compiled.   One way of testing whether the field-dipole interaction dominates the dipole 

order is to compare the relative angle distribution function that is observed to the dilute 

limit given by equation (7).

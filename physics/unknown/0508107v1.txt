Abstract 

Using the contemporary thermodynamic equations of elastic solids leads to contradictions with 

the fundamental statements of thermodynamics.  Two examples are presented to expose the 

inconsistencies.  In example one the internal energy between the initial and final states shows 

path dependency while in example two changing the temperature of a system at constant 

volume produces mechanical work.  These results are contradictory with the fundamentals of 

thermodynamics and indicate that the contemporary description of elastic solids needs to be 

revisited and revised.

In solid phase the relationship between the pressure and volume is described by the isothermal 

   

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

It is assumed that the  solid  is  homogeneous, isotropic, non-viscous  and  that the elasticity is 

linear.  It is also assumed that the stresses are isotropic; therefore, the principal stresses can be 

identified as the pressure

The volume of a solid system at a given temperature and pressure can be calculated by 

employing the equations of the volume coefficient of expansion and the bulk modulus.  Allowing 

one of the variables to change while the other one held constant the calculation can be done in 

two steps (Fig. 1),

According to the first law of thermodynamics the differentials of the internal energy [U] of a 

system can be calculated in the same way in solid phase as in gas phase thus the differential of 

the internal energy is equal with the sum of the differentials of the thermal and the mechanical 

energies.

where q is the heat, supplied to or taken away from the system, w is the mechanical work, done 

by  or  on  the  system,  n  is  the  number  of  moles,  and  Vc   is  the  molar  heat  capacity  at  constant 

volume.    Heating  up  a  system  at  zero  pressure  from  zero  temperature  to  temperature  T  the 

internal energy of the system will increase as:

Applying pressure on the system at constant temperature and increasing the pressure from zero 

pressure to pressure p will change the internal energy of the system  (

)TpU∆

 by the mechanical 

work  (

)Tpw∆

 done on the system.  Besides the exponential nature of the isothermal curves (Eq. 

3-4) the area (isothermal work function) under these curves almost identical with a triangle area.  

Small deviation could occur at extremely high pressures.  The mechanical work, therefore, will 

be calculated as:

Subscript path-1 indicates the path which was followed between the initial and final conditions.  

The internal energy is state function; therefore, the internal energy change between the initial and 

final states is the same no matter what path has been followed between these two states (Figure 

2a).  Using the previous example the internal energy of the final state should be the same if the 

pressure  is  applied  on  the  system  at  zero  temperature  first  and  then  the  system  is  heated  up  to 

temperature T at constant pressure (path-2).

This result contradicts with the original assumption

 indicating that work had been done 

at  constant  volume.    The  inequality  of  the  initial  and  final  work  can  be  easily  justified  by  the 

visual inspection of Figure 2b. 

In  both  examples  the  currently  accepted  thermodynamic  description  of  elastic  solids  gives 

erroneous  results.    These  erroneous  results  indicate  that  either  the  original  assumption,  the 

internal energy is a state function, or the thermodynamic equations used for the calculations are 

incorrect.  It is very unlikely the state function of the internal energy can be questioned leaving 

no  other  chose  then  assuming  that  the  inconsistencies  in  the  thermodynamics  of  elastic  solids 

arise from incorrect thermodynamics equations.

Figure 2.   Examples for the existing inconsistencies in the current thermodynamic description 

of  elastic  solids.    (a)    The  internal  energy  between  an  initial  and  final  state  shows  path 

dependency if the current conventional thermodynamic expressions are used.  (b)  Heating up a 

system at constant volume changes the mechanical work stored by the system.  According to the 

current  thermodynamic  establishment  no  mechanical  work  is  done  by  or  on  the  system  if  the 

volume is held constant.

Abstract  

       Recently  published  formulas  for  the  one-center  integrals  arising  in  atomic  Hartree-Fock-

Roothaan (HFR) calculations with noninteger  n  STOs  (S.Gümüş, T. Özdoğan, Chin. J. Chem., 

22 (2004) 1262) are critically analyzed. The purpose of this note is to point out that the presented 

in these work relations for the integer 

n

-nuclear attraction and kinetic energy integrals which are 

available in the literature (C.C.J. Roothaan, J. Chem. Phys., 19 (1951) 1445) can not be used for 

noninteger  n  STOs. In addition, the formulas for two-electron integrals can be obtained from the 

published  in  the  literature  (T.  Koga,  K.  Kanayama,  Chem.Phys.Let.,  266(1997)123;  I.I. 

Guseinov, B.A. Mamedov, Theor. Chem. Acc.,108 (2002) 21) relations by changing the indices. 

It should be noted that the accuracy of computer values for ground states energy of some closed 

and open shell atoms in the case of noninteger 

n

 STOs is not guaranteed since the calculations 

were performed by the use of integer 

n

-one electron integrals. It is argued that the paper sheds 

no new light on the subject and that it is altogether misleading.

I. Introduction 

     It  is  well  known  that  the  noninteger 

n

  STOs  (  NISTOs)  provide  a  more  flexible  basis  for 

atomic calculations than usual integer 

n

 STOs ( ISTOs) and also the energies calculated by the 

use  of  NISTOs  lead  to  better  atomic  energies  than  in  conventional  ISTOs  [1,2].  Gümüş  and 

Özdoğan in Ref. [3] published formulas for the one-center one- and two- electron integrals over 

noninteger 

n

  STOs  by  the  use  of  which  performed  the  HFR  calculations  for  ground  states  of 

some atoms. The calculation results of ground states energies (see Tables 3 and 4) in the case of  

noninteger 

n

 STOs were obtained by the use of formulas for the one-center integer 

n

- nuclear 

attraction and kinetic energy integrals (see Eqs.(3) and (4) of Ref.[3]) contained in the literature 

[4]. The purpose of this Comment is to demonstrate that the relations for one-center two-electron 

integrals over noninteger 

n

 STOs published by Gümüş and Özdoğan in Ref.[3] are not original 

and they can easily be derived from the relationships given in the literature (see. e.g., Refs.[5, 6]) 

by changing the indices.

integrals with noninteger 

n

 STOs have been established in Ref.[6]. Using Eqs.(19), (21), (22), 

(24), (30) and (31) of Ref.[6] it is easy to obtain for the one-center two-electron integrals, Eq.(1),

indices.  Thus,  all  of  the  formulas  given  by  Gümüş  and  Özdoğan  are  not  original  and  they  are 

available in Refs.[4-6].

Abstract

The  paper  Astronomical  Constraints  on  the  Cosmic  Evolution  of  the  Fine
Structure  Constant  and  Possible  Quantum  Dimensions1,  published  in  Physical  Review
Letters,  involves two  fundamental problems  which largely  invalidate the stated  and  the
implied  conclusions.    The  problems  stem  from  that  the  fine  structure  constant,  α,  is
composite; it is defined as a function of the fundamental constants:  c, q, h or h/2π,
and  µ
0.    Any  variation  in  α  requires  an  associated  variation  in  at  least  one  of
those  constants.    Such  variation  would  have  even  more  significant  implications  than
variation in α.

0  or  ε

The  major  problem  is  dimensional.    The  defined  α  is  dimensionless;  however,
that is the result of a canceling of dimensions among its dimensioned components.  Just
as the dimensions of all components in a mathematical expression of a physical law must
be  consistent,  so  also  must  the  dimensions  of  any  components  involved  in  a  "cosmic
evolution", especially fundamental constants.  The dimensional aspect for α in this regard
has not been sufficiently treated in the report.

The  necessary  dimensional  theory  for  a  "cosmic  evolution"  of  a  fundamental
constant  is  developed  in  the  present  paper.    A  conclusion  is  that  any  dimensionless
constant, e.g. α, cannot "evolve"  On the other hand, α could stand invariant yet with off-
setting  variation  in  its  components:    c,  h,  q,  etc.    Dimensional  analysis  requires  that  if
there  is  "evolution"  among  α's  components  then  such  off-setting  is  mandatory;  but,
lacking the theory, the paper summarily rejects that possiblity

Clearly study of the "cosmic evolution" of c, h, and q is needed, not that of α.

Background  of  the  Problem

Roger Ellman

The  paper  Astronomical  Constraints  on  the  Cosmic  Evolution  of  the  Fine
Structure  Constant  and  Possible  Quantum  Dimensions1  published  in  Physical  Review
Letters  --  December  25,  2000  --  Volume  85,  Issue  26,  pp  5511-5514,  presents  "...
measurements of absorption by the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen toward
radio  sources  at  substantial  look-back  times.  These  data  are  used  in  combination  with
observations of rotational transitions of common interstellar molecules to set limits on the
evolution of the fine structure constant ...".

The American Institute of Physics [AIP] described this research in a summary as

follows [Physics New Update, Number 517 (Story 1), 21 December 2000]:

Limits on the Cosmic Evolution of the Fine Structure Constant

Denoted by the Greek letter alpha, the fine structure constant sets
the absolute strength of the electromagnetic force at work inside
atoms and in the cosmos. Besides this, alpha incorporates within
itself  several  of  the  other  important  fundamental  constants  of
nature,  and  is  defined  as  2  times  pi  times  the  charge  of  the
electron squared, divided by the product of the speed of light and
Planck's constant [sic].

If  alpha  has  changed  over  the  eons,  then  part  of  the  redshift
exhibited  by  the  spectra  of  distant  galaxies  would  not  be
attributable  exclusively  to  the  expansion  of  the  universe,  thus
throwing  off  many  astrophysics  calculations.  Hence  it  is
desirable to  troll for different  physical  constants  in  past  epochs
much as one scans core samples from Greenland to gather fossil
bits of ancient air trapped in the ice layers

A  new  comparison  of  the  21-cm-wavelength  emission  of
hydrogen  atoms  in  distant radio  galaxies  with  that  of  terrestrial
hydrogen  reduces  the  systematic  uncertainties  by  an  order  of
magnitude  relative  to  previous  studies  using  this  technique  and
suggests that any non-expansion contribution to redshifts would
be in the fifth decimal at best. Equivalently, the measured limit
on proportional change in alpha is less [than] 3.5 x 10-15 per
year out to a look-back time of 4.8 billion years.

The Problem of a Composite Constant

This  research,  described  in  both  the  cited  paper  and  in  related  earlier  papers,
involves two  fundamental  problems  which  largely invalidate  the  stated  and  the  implied
conclusions  derived  from  the  observed  data.    The  problems  stem  from  that  the  fine
structure  constant,  α,  is  a  composite  constant;  that  is,  it  is  defined  as  a  function  of  the
fundamental constants:  c, q, h or h/2π, and µ
0.  Any variation in α  requires

0 or ε

2

an associated, accommodating variation in at least one of those constants.  Such variation
would have even more significant implications than variation in α.

On  the  other  hand,  α  could  stand  invariant  yet  only  because  of  off-setting
variations in some combination of c, h, q, etc.  The authors allude to argument "... against
models of a 'cosmic conspiracy' in which the individual constants vary in concert to result
in  a  given  observable  remaining  invariant..."  that  is,  the  component  constants  of  α
varying  individually  but  so  as  to  precisely  cancel  to  an  overall  non-variation  in  α.
However; the theory that they present is quite deficient, as is their dimensional analysis,
so that they are unable to recognize that such a "cosmic conspiracy" is not only possible
but imperative, as presented further below.

For  all  of  these  reasons  it  can  be  stated  in  particular  that  no  conclusion  with
regard to the constancy of c, h, and q can be derived from the experimental observations
as reported and that lead to the conclusion that any variation in α is, or approaches being,
negligible.    Likewise,  a  conclusion  that  any  non-expansion  contribution  to  redshifts
would  be  "in  the  fifth  decimal"  at  most  [as  suggested  in  the  AIP  summary  and  in  the
subject report] is completely unjustified by the research reported.

Finally, dimensional analysis shows that it is impossible for α to "evolve".  Thus,
it is  difficult  to  avoid  the  conclusion  that  the  reported  research,  while  interesting,  is  of
little  use  and  that  the  effort  and  expense  would  be  much  more  usefully  invested  in
researching "cosmic evolution" of c and h, at least, and not that of α.

Dimensional Analysis

The  defined  quantity,  α,  is  dimensionless;  however,  that  is  the  result  of  a
canceling of dimensions among its components:  c, q, h or h/2π, and µ
0.  Just
as  the  dimensions  in  all  components  of  the  mathematical  expression  of  a  physical  law
must be consistent, so also must the dimensions of any components involved in a "cosmic
evolution".    The  dimensional  aspect  of  α  in  this  regard  has  not  been  treated  in  the
researchers'  reports.    If  it  had,  the  consequent  impossibility  of  change  in  the
dimensionless fine structure constant, α, just as for π and for the natural logarithmic base,
ε, would have been concluded.

0 or ε

Because  the  various  physical  constants  are  interrelated  through  the  laws  of
physics  a  "cosmic  evolution"  in  c  would  require  an  associated  evolution  in  the  other
fundamental constants.  The individual evolution of each of the constants, c, h, q, G,
etc., must be consistent with that of each of the others; that is, when those quantities as
"evolving"  variables  interact  in  the  various  laws  of  physics  the  evolutions  must  be
consistent.    The  situation  is  exactly  the  same  as  the  essential  requirement  that  the
dimensions in which quantities are measured must be overall consistent with each other
when those quantities are involved together in physical laws.

For  that  purpose,  the  dimensions  of  the  quantities  being  dealt  with  need  to  be
clarified  here.    If  a  fundamental  constant  that  is  not  dimensionless  were  to  vary  an
immediately following question would be, "What aspect of it is varying ?"  For example,
if the speed of light, c, were to vary the variation would have to be in one or both of the
distance traveled and the time required because the dimensions of c are length [L] and
time [T].

A  full  discussion  of  dimension  systems  will  be  found  in  Section  3,  "Physical
Units and Standards" of Handbook of Engineering Fundamentals, First Edition, Ovid W.
Eshbach, New York, John Riley & Sons, 1947, as well as other works.  Per Eshbach, one
could use a different dimension for each physical quantity but it is more economical (as
well as more  succinctly  clear) to  use  a small  set  of  "fundamental"  dimensions  with  the
remainder  of  the  quantities  having  their  dimensions  expressed  as  a  combination  of  the

3

"fundamental"  dimensions  according  to  the  physical  laws  (expressed  in  mathematical
relationships) that pertain.

In principal any sufficiently complete set of quantities might be chosen to be the
"fundamental" ones; however, practice has been to essentially always make length [L]
and time [T] fundamental.  Usually to those is then added mass [M], those three being
the common dimensions of mechanics.  (It can be observed that these three dimensions
seem rather natural and fundamental to we humans, perhaps out of habit, perhaps because
of the nature of material reality.)

Again per Eshbach, a minimum of three fundamental dimensions is sufficient for
mechanics  but  a  fourth  is  used  to  treat  "heat"  and / or  "electromagnetism".    In  heat
systems  the  added  fundamental  dimension  is  usually  temperature  [θ]  (because  time
already uses "T").  In treatments of electromagnetism the added fundamental dimension
is  found to  be charge  [Q]  in  some  cases  and  permeability  [µ]  in  others  with  several
systems not using [M] and having two special fundamental dimensions that include one
or more of: electric current [I], voltage [V], and resistance [R].

For the present analysis and development it is possible and more effective to treat
all  phenomena  as  reduced  to  mechanics.    Only  the  common  three  fundamental
dimensions  [M],  [L],  and  [T]  are  required.    Charge,  for  example,  can  readily  be
related  to  these  three  dimensions  by  means  of  Coulomb's  and  Newton's  laws.    Briefly
(using the notation "{x}" to mean "the dimensions of x"), the development is as follows.

Therefore,  at  least  for  the  present  purposes,  the  dealing  with  α  and  its  component
fundamental  constants,    c,  q,  h  or  h/2π  ,  and  µ
0  ,  the  only  dimensions
involved are the fundamental dimensions of mechanics, [L], [M], and [T].

0  or  ε

An  "evolution"  of  a  fundamental  constant  must  involve  evolution  of  its
dimensional aspects.  Because such a constant is  fundamental  a "cosmic evolution" of it

5

must  represent  evolution  of  the  corresponding  fundamental  dimensional  aspects  of
material reality:  evolution of the mass [M] aspect of material reality, or of that of length
[L], or of time [T], or of some combination of them.  It must represent evolution of
the fundamental measure of all mass or all length or general time of the material universe.
But, which one(s) ?

Time  cannot  "evolve".    It  is  the  independent  variable  of  material  reality.    It  is
only made measurable by the occurrence of events, of changes which occur in space, in
material volume made up of length dimensions and occupied by mass [and its equivalent,
energy].    Time  being  the  independent  variable  of  material  reality,  whether  it  varies
systematically, varies chaotically, or is rigorously constant is beyond our ability to detect.
For us it cannot but appear constant.

Mass might be thought to be able to vary, especially in that we "feel" about mass
as  that  it  is  substantial.    But  mass  is  merely  the  ratio  of  applied  force  to  resulting
acceleration.  Mass is proportional to frequency, f, per the familiar relationship m·c2
= h·f.  As is the case with time, frequency, which is time's reciprocal, cannot vary nor
"anti-vary" and, therefore, neither can mass.  [This does not preclude relativistic variation
of mass with velocity, nor its conversion to / from energy.  It is the fundamental measure
of all mass of the material universe, its "mass-ness" that cannot vary.]

Therefore, by default, any "cosmic evolution" of a fundamental constant must be

an evolution of the length [L] aspect of material reality.

And, consequently, it is impossible for the dimensionless fine structure constant,
α,  to  vary  at  all  --  just  as  variation  is  impossible  for  π  and  for  the  natural  logarithmic
base,  ε.    The  authors'  allusion  to,  and  intended  refutation  of,  a  "cosmic  conspiracy"  to
cause variation in the component constants of α to precisely cancel to a net non-variation
in α was mentioned above.  The "conspiracy" is, of course, the same natural behavior as
in which the natural dimensions of the components of α and the form of the definition of
α cause the component dimensions to cancel to a net non-dimensional α.

And,  further,  it  is  at  least  theoretically  possible  for  there  to  be  a  "cosmic
evolution"  of  e.g.:  c,  having  the  dimensions  [L/T]  and  h,  having  the  dimensions
[M·L2/T].    The  importance  of  that  issue  and  its  affect  on  existing  cosmology  and
astrophysical calculations [e.g. as referred to in the AIP description, above] is such that
the investigation of "cosmic evolution" in c and h, especially, has become urgent.

Effort and expense would much more usefully be invested in researching "cosmic
evolution" of c and h.  Procedures for this and expected results have been presented in
analyses  where  the  original  motivation  was  the  investigation  of  yet  unexplained  or
inconsistent recent experimental results, results which can be interpreted as observational
evidence of evolution of fundamental constants.2, 3, 4, 5

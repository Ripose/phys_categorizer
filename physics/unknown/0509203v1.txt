Abstract— Fast and highly accurate method based on the Muller 
contour  integral  equations  and  a  trigonometric-trigonometric 
Galerkin discretization technique is presented for spectral design 
and  fine-tuning  of  clusters  of  whispering-gallery  (WG)  mode 
microdisk resonators and photonic crystal (PC) defect cavities. It 
is shown that degeneracy and near-degeneracy of natural modes 
as  well  as  modes  optical  confinement  in  coupled  resonator 
clusters  are  significantly  influenced  by  the  symmetry  of  the 
structure.  Photonic  molecules  with  greatly  enhanced  quality 
factors are designed by exploiting the symmetry of the molecular 
inter-cavity  coupling  distances.

Potential  applications  of  the  spectrally  engineered  coupled-

I.  INTRODUCTION 

H 

IGH-Q semiconductor microdisks and photonic crystal 
defect  cavities  are  essential  for  the  development  of  the 
next  generation  of  optoelectronic  components  such  as  light 
emitting  diodes,  low  threshold  microlasers,  narrow-linewidth 
wavelength  selective  filters,  biochemical  sensors,  etc  [1,  2]. 
Arranging  several  electromagnetically  coupled  microcavities 
into  so-called  ‘photonic  molecules’  offers  a  possibility  of 
achieving  new 
the  devices  without 
compromising the high Q-factors of individual cavities [3].  

functionalities  of 

Advanced  lithographic  techniques  now  enable  robust 
fabrication  of  semiconductor  photonic  molecules  of  various 
shapes  and  sizes  [3,  4].  Complex  2-D  and  3-D  coupled-
resonator structures can also be formed by micromanipulation 
or  self-assembly  of  polystyrene  microspheres  [5,  6]  and  by 
linking together polymer-blend microparticles generated from 
microdroplets  of  dilute  solution [7]. Among various practical 
applications  of  coupled-microcavity  structures  are 
low-
threshold microlasers [4, 8, 9], mode switching [4], high-order 
optical  waveguide  filters  [10,  11],  and  optical  power  transfer

Research, University of Nottingham, Nottingham. She now is with the School

trough coupled-resonator optical waveguides (CROWs) [5, 7, 
9].  Furthermore,  coupled-microcavity  models  can  be  useful 
for  interpreting  narrow  peaks  observed  in  experimental 
spectra of random powder lasers when a powder particle size 
is comparable to or larger than the emission wavelength [12]. 

However,  micro-  to  nano-scale  sizes  and  high  index 
contrasts  make  accurate  and  efficient  modeling  of  coupled-
resonator  structures  computationally  challenging.  Simple  and 
flexible  finite-difference  time-domain  method,  while  being  a 
main workhorse in simulation of optical microcavities [4, 13], 
may  suffer  from  staircasing  errors  or  become  prohibitively 
computationally  expensive  for  complex  cavity  geometries. 
Other  popular  numerical  tools  such  as  the  coupled  mode 
theory and the tight binding approximation are able to provide 
fast initial designs of coupled-microcavity structures, but have 
uncontrollable accuracy.  

Simulation  tools  based  on  a  rigorous  integral-equation 
formulation used in this paper, which take into account all the 
mutual  electromagnetic  interactions  in  the  system,  have 
already been proven to yield accurate solutions to a variety of 
design  problems  in  photonics  [14].  They  provide  not  only 
faster results but also insights into physics of optical resonator 
clusters and general design rules to improve their performance 
for a variety of existing and emerging applications. 

II.  METHODOLOGY  

We  consider  an  eigenvalue  problem  for  a  set  of  closely 
located side-coupled microdisk resonators as illustrated in Fig. 
1.  Due  to  strong  vertical  confinement  in  thin  high-index-
contrast  microdisks,  it  is  possible  to  separate  the  modal  field 
solutions into two polarizations: TE and TM, which have the 
electric  (magnetic)  field  polarized  in  the  plane  of  the 
microdisk.  All  the  electromagnetic  field  components  for  the 
TM  (TE)  polarization  can  be  expressed  through  a  single  z-
component of either electrical or magnetic field, which satisfy 
the 2-D Helmholtz equation, field continuity conditions at all 
the material interfaces, and a Reichardt’s condition at infinity 
[15]. The effective values of microdisk refractive indices used 
in the following 2-D analysis are calculated with the effective 
index method, which assumes that the microdisk modes have 
the same spatial dependence in the vertical direction as guided 
modes of an equivalent slab waveguide [14].

Homogeneous  equation  (4)  has  nonzero  solutions  only  at 
frequencies  where  the  equation  matrix  becomes  singular. 
Complex eigenfrequencies of the optical modes supported by 
a  set  of  coupled  resonators  are  found  by  searching  for  the 
roots  of  the  matrix  determinant  in  the  complex  frequency 
plane.  Once  the  eigenfrequencies  are  found,  the  modal  fields 
and  emission  characteristics  can  be  calculated  by  solving  the 
homogeneous matrix equation (4) at the eigenfrequencies. 

III.  ALGORITHM VALIDATION AND ACCURACY 

First,  we  test  the  developed  algorithms  against  the  results  of 
finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations available in 
the  literature.  A  finite-size  photonic  crystal  cavity  composed 
of  25  GaAs  rods  in  air  is  chosen  as  a  test  structure  (Fig.  2). 
This  PC  cavity  has  four  TM  defect  modes  in  the  bandgap 
(from  0.29  d/λ  to  0.42  d/λ):  non-degenerate  OO  and  EE 
quadrupole  modes  (Fig.  2  a,  b),  a  non-degenerate  second-
order monopole mode (Fig. 2 c), and a double-degenerate (OE 
and  EO)  hexapole  mode  (Fig.  2  d).  Here,  the  modes  are 
classified  in  accordance  with  their  field  symmetry  relative  to 
the  x  and  y  axes  (e.g.,  OE  mode  is  anti-symmetrical  with 
respect  to  the  x  axis  and  symmetrical  with  respect  to  the  y 
axis).

The  resonant  frequencies  and  Q-factors  of  the  four  PC 
cavity modes computed with MBIEs algorithm and a standard 
2-nd order FDTD scheme [13] with Yee’s cell of (25 nm)2 are 
presented  in  Table  1.  Thanks  to  exponential  convergence  of 
the  MBIEs  algorithm,  the  guaranteed  uniqueness  of  solution, 
and  the  choice  of  the  Green’s  functions  satisfying  the 
radiation  condition  at  infinity,  the  MBIEs  results  in  Table  1 
have been obtained with the machine precision. It can be seen 
that the values of the resonant frequencies computed with both 
methods  are  in  good  agreement.  However,  as  the  Q-factors 
grow,  failing  ability  of  the  FDTD  algorithm  with  the  same 
spatial  grid  to  reproduce  their  values  accurately  becomes 

evident. To reach the same accuracy of the FDTD solution for 
the  high-Q  hexapole  mode  as  for  the  lower-Q  monopole,  the 
problem  matrix  size  (and  thus  the  computer  resources)  will 
have  to  be  increased  significantly  due  to  the  polynomial 
convergence rate of the FDTD scheme.

μm radii and a single defect rod of 0.6 μm radius. 

Having  tested  the  algorithm  and  software,  we  will  now 
apply  it  to  study  optical  properties  of  coupled-microcavity 
structures  of  various  shapes  with  the  aim  to  establish  design 
rules to form photonic molecules with improved performance. 

IV.  SPECTRAL ENGINEERING OF MICROCAVITY CLUSTERS 

A.  Optical spectra of isolated microcavities 

Circular  microdisk  resonators  support  dense  frequency- 
dependent  TE-  and  TM-  spectra  of  whispering-gallery  (WG) 
modes  confined  in  the  microdisk  by  the  mechanism  of  the 
total  internal  reflection.  The  TE-  (TM-)  modes  are  classified 
as  WGE(H)m,n  modes,  m  being  the  azimuthal  mode  number, 
and n the radial mode number (see, e.g. [1, 2, 14] for detail). 
Due  to  the  symmetry  of  the  structure,  all  the  WG-modes  are 
double-degenerate,  and  the  number  of  high-  and  low-Q  WG 
modes increases with the increase of the cavity optical size. 

In  photonic  crystal  defect  cavities,  the  photonic-bandgap 
effect is used for strong light confinement in the cavity plane, 
and introduced defects result in appearance of a finite number 
of  localized  states  in  the  band  gap  [1,  2,  13,  18,  19].  Unlike 
WG-mode  microdisk  resonators,  PC  defect  cavities  can 
support high-Q non-degenerate modes (Fig. 2 a-d). 

B.  Mode splitting in double-cavity photonic molecules 

If two microcavities are electromagnetically coupled (e.g., via 
a  finite-width  airgap  [4,  8]  or  a  narrow  material  bridge  [3]),

non-degenerate  individual  cavity  modes  split  into  two  non-
degenerate  bonding  (symmetrical)  and  anti-bonding  (anti-
symmetrical)  modes.  An  example  of  mode  splitting  showing 
near-field portraits of a monopole mode of a single PC cavity 
as well as bonding and anti-bonding modes of a double-cavity 
photonic  molecule  is  presented  in  Fig.  3.  The  anti-bonding 
mode  is  red-shifted  and  the  bonding  mode  is  blue-shifted. 
These  results  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  plane-wave 
scattering 
for  photonic  crystals  doped  with 
microcavities  computed  in  [18].  Similar  theoretical  and 
experimental  observations  of  the  mode  doublets  have  been 
made  for  non-degenerate  zero-order  modes  of  side-coupled 
circular [19] and square-shaped [3] microdisk resonators.

Fig. 3.  The electric field profiles (Ez) of (a) a non-degenerate monopole 
mode in a hexagonal photonic crystal defect cavity (λ = 9.054 μm, Q = 
56.8);  (b)  bonding  (λ  =  8.837  μm,  Q  =  90)  and  (c)  anti-bonding  (λ  = 
9.324  μm,  Q  =  67.4)  non-degenerate  modes  of  a  photonic  molecule 
composed of two coupled hexagonal PC cavities. PC lattice parameters 
are as follows: εrods = 8.41, a = 0.6 μm, d = 4.0 μm. 

In turn, degenerate WG-modes of pairs of optical resonators 
brought  together  split  into  two  groups  of  nearly-degenerate 
photonic molecule modes (see Fig. 4 as an example of double-
degenerate  WG2,1-mode  splitting  in  a  double-disk  photonic 
molecule).  The  number  of  nearly-degenerate  modes  in  each 
group  depends  on  the  individual  cavity  mode  degeneracy 
(e.g.,  two  for  a  circular-disk  photonic  molecule  [20]).  The 
mode  with  the  highest  Q-factor  is  the  blue-shifted  anti-
bonding mode anti-symmetrical with respect to both x- and y-
axes. Note that similar degenerate mode splitting occurs when 
the  cavity  is  located  close  to  a  conducting  plane,  a  material 

interface or a slab waveguide [15]. Geometrical imperfections 
may further split the modes [21] causing appearance of several 
closely located peaks in the photonic molecule spectra [22].

The  performed  careful  review  of  the  properties  of  double-
cavity photonic molecules supporting various types of modes 
gives  us  a  useful  insight  into  the  behavior  of  more  complex 
coupled-microcavity  structures.  In  the  following  sections, 
symmetry-enhanced  mode 
and 
degeneracy  removal  mechanisms  are  identified  through  a 
detailed  study  of  the  degenerate  mode  wavelength  splitting 
and  Q-factors  change  as  a  function  of  the  photonic  molecule 
geometry and the inter-cavity coupling distances.

C.  Optical spectra of linear photonic molecules 

First,  linear  chains  of  side-coupled  microcavities  will  be 
studied  and  common  features  of  their  optical  spectra  will  be 
identified. Here and in the following sections, the geometrical 
and  material  parameters  of  the  resonators  are  chosen  as 
follows:  GaInAsP  microdisks  have  diameters  of  1.8  μm  and 
thickness  of  200  nm.  Only  the  TE  modes  with  one  vertical 
field variation can be supported in the disk of such thickness, 
all  the  TM-polarized  modes  and  higher  vertical  order  TE 
modes  are  suppressed.  The  effective  value  of  the  dielectric 
permittivity  (ε=6.9169+i10-4)  used  in  the  following  2D 
analysis  corresponds  to  the  propagation  constant  of  the  TM-
polarized  mode  in  an  equivalent  slab  waveguide  at  1.55  μm  
[14]  (spontaneous  emission  peak  of  GaInAsP  at  room 
temperature is located at 1.55-1.58 μm). 

Fig.  5  shows  the  variations  in  the  modal  wavelengths  and 
Q-factors  of  WGE6,1  modes  in  a  linear  photonic  molecule 
composed  of  three  identical  circular  microdisk  resonators

distance.  One  can  clearly  see  (Fig.  5  a)  that  split  modes  of 
different  symmetry  group  into  nearly  degenerate  mode  pairs, 
with  bonding modes shifting to longer wavelengths and anti-
bonding  modes  shifting  to  shorter  wavelengths.  The  number 
of  nearly  degenerate  mode  pairs  is  equal  to  the  number  of

excellent  agreement  with  experimental  data  [4].  With  the 
increase  of  the  WG-mode  azimuthal  order  the  spacing 
between  nearly  degenerate  modes  decreases,  which  makes  it 
difficult  to  distinguish  between  individual  modes  in  the 
photonic molecule spectra. However, the modes never become 
truly degenerate as they have different imaginary parts of the 
complex natural frequencies (and thus different Q-factors).

the  modes  are  classified  by  how  they  transform  under  the 
mirror  operation  with  respect  to  the  symmetry  axes  of  the 
structure  (medians  of  the  triangular  molecule,  and  symmetry 
lines going through the corners or the sides of the square and 
hexagonal molecules).

The  Q-factors  of  the  linear-molecule  modes  oscillate 
around the value of the single-cavity Q-factor (Fig. 5b). This 
phenomenon  has  been  studied  theoretically  for  double-cavity 
molecules in [20] and [23], though in [23] mode splitting has 
not  been  discussed.  Thus,  suppression  or  enhancement  of 
modes  can  be  achieved  by  properly  tuning  the  inter-cavity 
coupling distance. However, due to the near-degeneracy of the 
modes,  single-mode  operation  necessary  for  microlaser 
applications cannot be achieved in linear photonic molecules. 

D.  Symmetry-assisted mode enhancement 

In  this  section,  we  will  study  the  optical  spectra  of  high-
symmetry  photonic  molecule  structures  such  as  triangles, 
squares  and  hexagons  to  reveal  the  role  of  symmetry  in

Fig.  6  shows  the  modal  wavelengths  and  Q-factors  in  a 
photonic  molecule  composed  of  three  microdisks  located  at 
the  corners  of  an  equilateral  triangle  versus  the  inter-cavity 
coupling distance. Note that only four modes instead of six are 
seen in the photonic molecule spectra. Due to the symmetry of 
the  structure,  two  modes  are  double-degenerate  (shown  with 
solid and dotted lines in Fig. 6). Non-degenerate modes have 
either odd or even field symmetry along the triangle medians 

single-mode 

these  non-degenerate  modes  experience 

(Fig. 7). An important feature of Fig. 6 b is that the Q-factors 
of 
the  most 
pronounced  increase  for  certain  values  of  the  inter-cavity 
distance.  This  effect  offers  a  way  to  design  symmetry-
enhanced 
photonic  molecule 
configurations.  We  find  that  the  distortion  of  the  molecule 
symmetry results in splitting of the degenerate WG-modes and 
reduces  the  effect  of  the  Q-factor  enhancement  of  the  non-
degenerate  ones  (which  is  in  agreement  with  the  optical  and 
microwave  experimental  data  for  zero-  and  low-azimuthal-
order  modes  of  square-  and  circular-disk  photonic  molecules 
[19, 24]). 

high-Q 

Next,  photonic  molecule  structures  with  higher  symmetry 
will  be  studied.  Fig.  8  presents  a  square-molecule  optical 
spectra  dependence  on  the  change  of  the  coupling  distance. 
Here,  four  modes  are  non-degenerate:  OO,  EE,  OE,  and  EO 
modes  (the  first  (second)  letter  denotes  the  modal  symmetry 
with  respect  to  the  diagonals  and  the  x-  and  y-  axes, 
respectively). The most significant Q-factor increase (e.g., by 
a  factor  of  23  for  the  OE  mode)  is  observed  for  the  modes 
with the odd symmetry along the square diagonals (see Fig. 9 
for their near-field portraits). It can be clearly seen that higher 
symmetry  of  a  square  molecule  yields  much  higher  mode 
enhancement than a triangular one.  

Finally,  modal  characteristics  of  a  hexagonal-shaped 
photonic  molecule  are  presented  in  Fig.  10.  Once  again,  the 
modes that can be drastically enhanced by carefully tuning the 
inter-cavity  coupling  distance  are  the  OO  and  OE  non-
degenerate modes with the odd symmetry with respect to the 
hexagon  diagonals.  Fig.  11  presents 
their  near-field 
distributions.  

Note  that  optimally  tuned  photonic  molecule  structures 
have  much  larger  free  spectral  range  than  larger-radius 
individual microdisk resonators with comparable values of Q-
factors.  Furthermore,  as  the  high-Q  modes  of  the  photonic 
molecules are non-degenerate, such structures are expected to 
be  less  sensitive  to  fabrication  imperfections  that  split  WG-
modes  of  single-cavity  resonators  causing  appearance  of 
parasitic peaks in their optical spectra [21]. Arranging circular 
resonators into photonic molecules also enables higher design 
flexibility than introducing artificial deformations to the shape 
of individual resonators [14, 21]. The above observations also 
reveal  the  analogy  between  the  WG-modes  in  symmetrical 
photonic  molecules  and  the  non-degenerate  high-Q  modes  in 
square  and  triangular  microcavities  (e.g.  recently  observed 
WG-like modes in square resonators) that have odd symmetry 
around the cavity diagonals [25, 26]. 

E.  Applications of spectrally-designed photonic molecules 
The  identified  properties  of  the  optical  spectra  of  high-
symmetry  photonic  molecules  can  be  advantageous  for 
various  applications  not  only  in  the  fields  of  optoelectronics 
and  laser  physics,  but  also  for  micro-  and  millimeter-wave 
technology  and  acoustics.  For  example, 
the  observed 
mechanism  of  the  significant  mode  Q-factor  enhancement 
accompanied  by  a  mode  polarization  degeneracy  removal

paves  a  way  for  designing  and  fabricating  single-mode 
photonic-molecule  lasers  with  large  spontaneous  emission 
factors  and  low  thresholds.  Furthermore,  as  the  mode 
wavelength  is  very  sensitive  to the  inter-cavity  distances,  the 
molecule geometry can be tuned to spectrally align the mode 
wavelength  with  the  semiconductor  material  gain  peak  thus 
increasing  the  fraction  of  spontaneous  emission  into  this 
mode.

Due to this high sensitivity of the modal frequencies and Q-
factors  to  the  change  of  the  molecule  structural  parameters, 
their  application  as  biochemical  sensors  is  expected  to  offer 
significantly  enhanced  sensitivity  compared 
to  single-
resonator  sensors.  Such  sensors  often  exploit  a  detection 
mechanism  based  on  measuring  the  resonant  frequency  shift 
caused  by  the  presence  of  a  biochemical  agent  through  the 
interaction  of  the  evanescent  field  of  the  WG-mode  outside 
the  resonator  with  the  analyte.  As  the  photonic  molecule 
modes 
their 
frequencies  and  Q-factors  should  be  more  sensitive  to  the 
change  of  the  refractive  index  in  the  inter-cavity  region  than 
the corresponding characteristics of a single cavity.

The  summarized  main  features  of  the  coupled-microcavity 
structures  and  established  design  rules  to  tailor  their  spectral 
characteristics  can  be  directly  applied  to  simulate  the  high-Q 
localized modes of powder lasers [12] and to design photonic 
molecules  composed  of  microspheres  [5-7,  27]  as  well  as  to 
the fields of microwave engineering [28] and acoustics [29]. 

V.  CONCLUSIONS 

is  a  powerful  general 

In  this  paper,  a  systematic  theoretical  study  of  the  properties 
of  whispering  gallery  modes  in  coupled-microcavity  clusters 
of  various  shapes  has  been  reported.  An  efficient  technique 
based on the MBIEs method has been developed and used to 
simulate  and  fine-tune  the  clusters  optical  characteristics  as 
well as to help in interpreting their experimental spectra. The 
MBIEs  method,  applied  here  to  study  WG-mode  circular-
microcavity  clusters  that  are  essential  for  a  variety  of 
applications, 
technique  enabling 
efficient  modeling  of  arbitrary-shape  resonators  [14,  15,  21, 
25].  The  algorithms,  numerical  results,  and  conclusions  have 
been  validated  by  comparing  them  against  the  available 
experimental data and FDTD computations. Several coupled-
microcavity  structures  with  symmetry-enhanced  Q-factors  of 
non-degenerate  modes  have  been  proposed  and  studied  in 
detail. Among possible applications of the designed structures 
is  development  of  low-noise,  low-threshold  novel  light 
sources  and  sensitive  biosensors,  as  well  as  providing  useful 
analogies  for  the  microwave  and  acoustic  devices  and 
components.

ABSTRACT

In  the  present  paper  a  new  concept  is  introduced  that:  ‘mass  is  a  quaternion 
 
quantity’.  The  concept  of  quaternion  mass  suggests  that  the  total  mass  M  of  a  moving 
body is quaternion sum of :  (i) the scalar (grain or rest) mass mg establishing its particle 
behavior and  (ii) the vector mass mp governing its wave properties.  Mathematically, the 
2)1/2  .    The  theory 
quaternion  mass    M  =  mg  +  mp  ;  the  magnitude  |M|  =  (mg
proposed  here  explains  successfully  several  effects  such  as  ‘Compton  effect’  and 
‘refraction of light’ which could not be explained otherwise by a single theory of wave or 
particle.  Also  explained  are  ‘Doppler  effect  for 
light’,  ‘photo-electric  effect’, 
‘Uncertainty principle’ and ‘Relativity’. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
 
The  longest  controversial  issue  in  the  scientific  history  is  perhaps  over  the 
fundamental  question  of  Nature  that  whether  light  is  wave  or  particle?  Huygens’  wave 
theory  succeeded  over  Newton’s  corpuscular  theory  as  the  wave  theory  explained 
successfully  several  important  phenomena  such  as  refraction  and  interference  whereas 
particle theory could not. However, in the beginning of 20th century the particle theory of 
light  (photon)  emerged  again  as  it  explained  clearly  some  observations  such  as  photo-
electric  effect  and  Compton  effect  whereas  the  wave  theory  ailed  to  do  so. In  order to 
resolve the controversy, de-Broglie [1] proposed the hypothesis for wave-particle duality 
suggesting  that  light  is  both,    particle  and  wave.  Moreover  he  also  suggested  that  a 
moving electron too can exhibit wave properties  and it was experimentally proved to be 
so.  However,  the  wave-particle  dilemma  especially  for  light  still  persists  [2-6]  in  some 
ways.  It  is  not  cleat  as  to  why  electromagnetic  radiation  behaves  as  particle  in  one 
experiment and as wavy in another experiment. Both the particle and wave aspects have 
never been observed simultaneously, as if one aspect comes into being  only if the other 
aspect is absent  and vice-versa. Attempt to identify one aspect vanishes the other [2-6]. 
In an attempt to resolve the dilemma, the novel concept of ‘quaternion mass’ is presented 
and its applicability is demonstrated in this paper.

2. NEED FOR THE NEW CONCEPT OF MASS 
 
 
However, the author would state/quote a few, as follows: 
 

Many arguments could be given in favor of the need for the new concept of mass. 

(ii) 

(i)  Mass  and  energy  are  no  more  separate  quantities,  but  are  interwoven  by 
Einstein’s        mass-energy  equation.  This  may  imply  that  mass  losses  its 
independent identity and    requires a new interpretation. 
It is known, as Ugarov [7] mentions in his book on special relativity that ‘rest 
mass of a system exceeds the sum of rest masses of constituent particles by a 
certain amount estimated in the reference frame in which the total momentum 
is  zero’.  He  states  further  that  ‘rest  mass  is  not  additive  quantity’.  Such  a 
property  of  mass  is uncommon in classical mechanics. It is tempting to bring 
in some new definition of mass for constituent particle. 
Is  mass    a  scalar,  a  vector  or  a  quaternion?  Rest  mass  is  definitely  a  scalar 
quantity.  Photon,  however  has  a  zero  rest-mass  though  it  has  a  total  mass 
(h(cid:542)/c)/c due to its momentum vector h(cid:542)/c. What about the mass of a moving 
body  having  a  rest-mass  &  momentum-vector?  The  quaternion  was  first 
proposed  by  Hamilton  [8]  as  a  sum  of  scalar  plus  vector [8-11].   Is  mass ‘a 
quaternion’ for a moving body? 

(iii) 

(iv)  Both the aspects of a moving body i.e., the corpuscular (material) nature and 
its  wave  behavior  have  never  been  observed  simultaneously.  Any  attempt  to 
identify one aspect vanishes the other aspect, as if these two aspects come out 
of two different entities (say, scalar and vector). Could mass be considered as 
‘quaternion  quantity’,  the  scalar  part  of  it  representing  the  material-content 
(rest-mass),  and  the  vector  part  (due  to  its  momentum  vector)  governing  its 
wave aspect? 
If  introduction  of  a  new  concept  of  mass  as  ‘quaternion  quantity’  could 
explain  various  phenomena  and  could  eliminate/minimize  ambiguity;  it  is 
worth  doing.   The  new  concept  may appear to be speculative at first glance, 
but  as  it  will  be  seen  later  that  its  success  and  capability  to  explain  several 
diverse phenomena is striking.  All avenues for the ‘Truth’ must be kept open. 

(v) 

 
 
3. QUATERNION-MASS  CONCEPT 
 
 
For the  ‘quaternion  mass  concept’  introduced here it is proposed that ‘mass is a 
quaternion quantity’ and that the total mass M of a moving body has two components: 
(i)  a  scalar  (particle  at  relatively-rest)  ‘grain-mass’  mg    and  (ii)  a  vector  ‘photonic 
mass’  mp  due  to  its  momentum.  This  may  tentatively  be  considered  as  a  postulate. 
However, it will be evident later that this novel concept of the ‘quaternion-mass’ has 
the  potential  to  explain  several  phenomena  without  any  real  contradiction  with  the 
present status of formulation in physical sciences of concern.

mp1 + mp2 = mp1

|M1| + |M2| = |M1

In  the  process  of  the  collision  of  the  particles, the  total  vector  photonic  mass  is 

with  grain  or  rest  mass  as  zero    and  photonic  mass  as  |M|  leading  to  Einstein’s  mass-
energy equation (Eq.3) as photonic energy E = |M|.v.c , 
 
 
 
 
4. COLLISION OF  PARTICLES AND CONSERVATION LAWS 
 
 
Consider two particles 1 and 2, initial masses of which before-collision are M1 = 
mg1  +  mp1    and  M2  =  mg2  +  mp2  .   During  collision, the  grain  and  the  photonic  masses 
could  be  ‘re-distributed’  between  them. Consider that after-collision the new masses for 
the two particles are M1
 
 
 
The total magnitude of the mass  |M|  for the colliding particles (which takes into 
account ‘relativistically’ both, the grain-mass and the photonic-mass) would therefore be 
‘conserved’ giving the following equation, 
 
 
 
 
also considered to be ‘conserved’ and thus, 
 
 
 
 
In fact, as it will  be more evident later in this paper that the conservation of total 
mass |M|  (Eq.4) is the mass-energy conservation, and that the conservation of photonic 
mass mp  (Eq.5) is the conservation of momentum. 
 
 
It  may  be  noted  that  the  ‘mass-quaternion’  introduced  in  this  paper  takes  into 
account  the  relativistic  aspects  as  reflected  in  Eqs.(1.e  &  1.f). Thus, in general, the rest 
(grain)  mass  is  not  conserved  in  collision      unless    the  colliding  particles  retain  their 
identities.  It is also noted that the ‘mass-quaternion’ is different from the ‘Hamiltonian’s 
quaternion’ ;  as  mass-quaternion is  in fact  relativistic. 
 
 
5. PHOTON SCATTERING 
 
 
to  study  the  photon  scattering,  take a general case of  collision (Fig.2) where a 
photon  strikes  (at  an  angle  x)  on  a  moving  object  (say,  electron)  and  scatters  away. 
Consider that before-collision the electron moving with a velocity v1 has a total mass M1 
= mg +  |M1|.v1/c  where mg is rest-mass of the electron, and that the incident photon (with 
a momentum hv/c) has a total mass M2 = 0 + h(cid:542)/c2 .  After collision;  the photon (at an 
/ = 0 + h(cid:542)//c2 , and that the 
angle (cid:537), with momentum hv/) is emerged with a total mass  M2
/ = 
electron comes out (at an angle (cid:303)) moving with a velocity v1

Equation  (4)  for  total-mass  conservation  reduces  to  mass-energy  conservation 

 
Equation (5) for photonic-mass conservation reduces to the following equations of 
momentum  conservation  corresponding  to  the  momentum  conservation  in  x  and  y 
directions,

equation as, 
 
 
 
where from Eq.(1.e) magnitude of total of quaternion mass are as follows, 
 
 
 
 
 

From Eqs. (6),(7),(8) and (9), the following expression is obtained, 

|M1| = mg/(1-v2/c2)1/2   and    |M1

|M1|.c2 + h(cid:542) = |M1

For  cases  where  the  incident  photon  strikes  not  the  electron  but  some  heavier 
object  such  as  an  observer(or  an  observing  instrument),  mirror  or  glass;    mg  will  be 
replaced  with  rest-mass  of  the  object  in  Eq.(10)  where  the  first  term  on  R.H.S.  would 
become negligible and the equation would reduce to,

(h(cid:542)/c)sin (cid:302) = (h(cid:542)//c/) sin (cid:534) , which gives the Snell’s law [14] for refraction as follows,  
since (cid:542) = (cid:542)/ , 
 

sin (cid:302) / sin (cid:534)  =  c/c/  = (cid:541) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(15) 

  
where  (cid:541)  is  the  refractive  index  of  the  second  medium-material  (say,  glass  (cid:541)  >  1)  with 
respect  to the first medium (say, air),  which indicates that speed of light (c/) in denser-
medium(glass)  would  be  less  than  the  speed  of  light  (c)  in  rarer-medium(air),    as 
expected and is in accordance with the results of wave theory. 
 
  
It  is  to  recall  that  the  main  reason  for  failure  of    Newtonian  corpuscular-theory 
was  that  it  predicts  wrong  results  about  speed  of  light  in  denser  medium    whereas  the 
wave- theory  predicts correctly.  The quaternion-mass concept, which considers light as 
particle  of    photonic-mass  (which  differs  in  the  two  media,  h(cid:542)/c2  in  one  medium  and  
h(cid:542)//c/ 2   in the other medium), also predicts (Eq.15) rightly. 
 
 
5.3.3 Partial refraction and partial reflection 
 
 
Consider that the incident light (n photons) strikes the stationary glass and that it 
is  partially  transmitted  (n2  photons)  into  and  partially  reflected (n1 photons) back,  such 
/) and 
that    n  =  n1  + n2 . As shown earlier, the frequencies: of incident((cid:542)), transmitted((cid:542)t
/)  light  are  same.  Here  also,  since  the  free-surface  can-not  take  shear-stress, 
reflected((cid:542)r
momentum conservation along the interface yields,   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For partial refraction and partial reflection,  n2 and n1 are the positive integers thus 
Eq.(16) leads to both, the reflection-law (Eq.14) and the refraction-law (Eq.15).  Possibly,  
specific  combinations  of  n1  and  n2  could  lead  to  the  understanding  of  bunching  /  anti-
bunching  of light [15]. 
   
 
6. PHOTO-ELECTRIC EFFECT 
 
 
When  a  photon of energy (h(cid:542)) strikes an electron(in an atom), part of its energy 
(W,  the  work-function)  is  used  up  for  removing  the  electron  from  the  atom,  thus  the 
remaining energy (h(cid:542)-W) is used to give a velocity v  to the electron. 
 
 
gives, 
 

If me is the total mass of an electron in the atom, conservation of total mass (Eq.4) 

n1 [sin(cid:302) – sin(cid:533)]  +  n2 [sin(cid:302) – (c/c/) sin(cid:534)]  =  0 

/  the above equation reduces to  

Taking n = n1 + n2  and (cid:542) = (cid:542)t

n (h(cid:542)/c) sin(cid:302) = n1 (h(cid:542)r

//c) sin(cid:533) + n2 (h(cid:542)t

//c/) sin(cid:534) 

/ = (cid:542)r

which  is  nothing  but  the  well-known    4-vector    invariant  in  unprimed  and  primed(/) 
coordinate system [18-20]. 
 
 
It  may  be  noted  that  the  relativistic  energy  equation  (19)  is  derived  from 
quaternion-mass  concept  equation  (1).  The  concept  of  ‘quaternion  mass’  finds  strength 
from  the  fact that reverse is also possible i.e., the quaternion-mass concept equation (1) 
could be derived from the relativistic energy equation (19).   
 
 
In  fact,  the  4-vector  invariance  (Eq.20)  is  equivalent  to  the  invariance  of  rest 
(grain)  mass,    in  unprimed  and  primed  coordinate  system.  This  is  consistent  with  the 
quaternion concept of mass; because a change of coordinate system would affect velocity 
to  change  the  vector  photonic-mass  thus  changing  the  total-mass,  whereas  the  scalar  
grain-mass (material) remains unchanged. 
 
 
The  special-relativity      in  the  concept  of  quaternion-mass    is  also  reflected  in 
Eq.(1.e) and Eq.(3).  in fact, the special-relativity is inherent in the concept of quaternion-
mass. 
 
 
9. DISCUSSION 
 
To  avoid  ambiguity  of  wave-particle,  some  new  terminology  is  suggested  as 
 
follows. A particle at rest (in laboratory) is let called as ‘grainon’, a particle moving with 
a speed v  (v < c) is let called as ‘quaternion’  and the particle moving with speed of light 
is  called  as  ‘photon’.  All;  grainon,  quaternion  and  photon,  let  be  ‘said’  as  particles! 
However, the grainon (at relative-rest v = 0) has corpuscular (material) nature, the photon 
(in  flight  v  =  c)  has  the  wave  nature    and  the  quaternion  (in  motion  v  <  c)  has  both 
corpuscular & wave natures. 
 
 
However,  as  per  Eq.(3)  inter-conversion  of  photon  and  grainon  is  possible. 
Moreover, when a photon is in motion (v = c) it behaves as wave (during its flight), but 
when  it  strikes  an  object      it  stops  (v  =  0,  momentarily  in  ‘Compton-effect’  and 
completely  in  ‘photo-electric  effect’  experiments)  and  thus  the  photon  behaves  as 
grainon. In experiments such as of ‘interference’ the two photon-streams interfere in the

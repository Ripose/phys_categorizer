The paper presents a theoretical study of the dynamics of the H + HCl system on the potential energy surface
(PES) of Bian and Werner (Bian, W.; Werner, H. -J., J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 112, 220). A time-dependent
wave packet approach was employed to calculate state-to-state reaction probabilities for the exchanged and
abstraction channels. The most recent PES for the system has been used in the calculations. Reaction
probabilities have also been calculated for several values of the total angular momentum J > 0. Those have
then been used to estimate cross sections and rate constants for both channels. The calculated cross sections
can be compared with the results of previous quasiclassical trajectory calculations and reaction dynamics
experimental on the abstraction channel. In addition, the calculated rate constants are in the reasonably good
agreement with experimental measurement.

1. Introduction

The gas-phase reaction of H + HCl and the corresponding
reverse reaction of Cl atoms with molecular H represent
important elementary steps in the H2 + Cl2 f 2HCl reaction
system, which has played a major role in the development of
chemical kinetics and to the environment
in atmospheric
chemistry.1,2 A large number of kinetics studies were carried
out for the H + HCl elementary reaction in the temperature
range 195 KeTe1200 K,3 including experiments in which the
influence of selective vibrational excitation of HCl on the
reaction rate was investigated.4-8 Recent studies9-16 of the
reaction H + HCl at a collision energy of 1.6 eV have measured
the integral cross section for the abstraction channel to be (2(1)
Å2, 9,10 where as the exchange plus energy-transfer channels gave
a combined cross section of (13(3) Å2. 9,10 It has been shown
by Wight et al.11 that the dominant process is energy transfer.2
In contrast to numerous experiments, only a few theoretical
studies have been reported for this H + HCl reaction.

Due to the relatively low collision energies employed in the
Cl + H2 dynamics experiments, these studies provided detailed
information about the region of the HClH potential energy
surface (PES) close to the threshold of reaction.17-23 However,
much less information is available concerning the high-energy
regions of the PES that can be assessed in H + HCl dynamics
experiments using translationally excited H atoms.24-27 The first
globally realistic Cl-H-H PES was calculated by Baer and
Last,26 and a more recent PES was published by Truhlar et al.27
Therefore, a scaled PES has been computed by Bian and Werner
(BW2)28 to get the dissociation energies right. The H2Cl reaction
system was presented by Bian et al.28 more recently. The PES
was developed using the highly accurate electronic structure
methods based on extensive ab initio calculations and very large
basis sets presently applied. The ab initio calculations were

carried out at more than 1200 nuclear geometries.28 The later
version of the BW2 PES was further improved by scaling the
correlation energies at all geometries with a constant factor.28
A major theoretical problem stems from the inability of
current ab initio and semiempirical methods in providing a
reliable PES. Recently, Aoiz et al.29,30 have carried out quasi-
classical trajectory (QCT) calculations on two versions of the
BW2 PES for the reaction.30 The calculated cross sections are
in reasonably good agreement with experimental measurement.
This provides some assurance that the BW2 PES may be
reasonably accurate near the transition state. To the best of our
knowledge, no time-dependent wave packet (TDWP) study for
the reaction system corresponding to a collision energy range
of [0.1,1.4]eV was reported on the BW2 PES.

In the present work, the reaction probabilities have been
calculated by employing TDWP method for several values of
the total angular momentum quantum number J > 0 on BW2
PES. Those have then been used to estimate cross sections and
rate constants for both channels. The calculated cross sections
can compared with the results of previous QCT calculations
and reaction dynamics experiments of Aoiz et al.30 and
experiments of Brownsword et al.25 on the abstraction channel.
The thermal rate constants of HCl are calculated by employing
the uniform J-shifting method,32,33 and a comparison with
experimental measurement is provided.

In this paper, we have carried out TDWP calculations for

the following two channels of the H + HCl reaction

2. Theory

Here, we briefly describe the TDWP method employed to
calculate the initial state-selected total reaction probability with
the final resolved products. The reader is referred to ref 34 for
more detailed discussions of the methodology. In the present
study, we solve the time-dependent Schro¨dinger equation

for the H + HCl reaction. The Hamiltonian expressed in the
reactant Jacobi coordinates for a given total angular momentum
quantum number J can be written as

where rb is the diatom internuclear, RB is the vector jointing the
center of mass of diatom to the atom, while (cid:237)r is the reduced
mass for HCl, and (cid:237)R is the reduced mass between H and HCl.
JB and jb represent the total angular momentum operator and the
rotational angular momentum operator of HCl, respectively.
V(rb, RB) is the interaction potential excluding the diatomic
potential of the diatom. The diatomic reference Hamiltonian
h(r) is defined as

where Vr(r) is a diatomic reference potential.

The time-dependent wave function satisfying the Schro¨dinger
eq 1 can be expanded in terms of the body-fixed translational-
vibrational-rotational basis, defined using the reactant Jacobi
coordinates, as35

rovibrational state, and (cid:15) is the parity of the system defined as
(cid:15) ) (-1)j+L with L being the orbital angular momentum
quantum number. The reader can find the definitions of various
basis functions elsewhere.34

The split-operator method36 is employed to carry out the wave
packet propagation. The time-dependent wave function is
absorbed at
the edges of the grid area to avoid artificial
reflections.37 Finally the initial state-selected total (final-state-
summed) reaction probabilities are obtained through the flux
calculation35 at the end of the propagation.

In practice, we can use the interpolation method to get the
probabilities for missing values of J; reaction probabilities at
only a limited number of total angular momentum values of J
need to be explicitly calculated.

As in refs 34, 38, we construct wave packets and propagate
them to calculate the reaction probabilities for PJ(E) each
product. The integral cross section from a specific initial state
j0 is obtained by summing the reaction probabilities over all
the partial waves on total angular momentum.

The rate constants are calculated for the initial states (V ) 0,
j ) 0) of HCl by using the uniform version32 of J-shifting
approximation.33 The initial state-specific thermal rate constant
in the uniform J-shifting scheme is given as

The numerical parameters for the wave packet propagation
are as follows: A total number of 200 sine functions (among
them 80 for the interaction region) are employed for the
translational coordinate R in a range of [0.8,14.0]a0. A total of
100 vibrational functions are employed for r in the range of
[0.8,8.5]a0 for the reagents HCl in the interaction region. For
the rotational basis, we use jmax ) 45. The number of K used in
our calculation is given by Kmax ) max (3, K0+2) starting with
K0 ) 0. The largest number of K used is equal to 6 for the j )
0, K0 ) 0 initial state (for (cid:15) ) -1, there is one less K block
used). These values of K0 and Kmax were determined following
an extensive series of tests.35 It was found that convergence of

in the entire energy region, was achieved up to a few percent.
The initial wave packet was centered at R ) 10a0, with a width
of 0.23a0 and an average translational energy of 0.8 eV.35 For
lower J, we propagate the wave packets for 15000 au of time
to converge the low energy reaction probability (in all calcula-
tions, a time step-size of 10 au was used). For J > 20, we
propagate the wave packets for a shorter time, because the
reaction probability in the low energy region is negligible.35 In
this calculation, we used J from 0 to 80 to calculate the cross
section.

3. Results and Discussion

Reaction Probabilities. First of all, we computed the energy
resolved reaction probabilities for collision energies in the range
of [0.1,1.4]eV with HCl initially in its ground state. The results
of J ) 0 as a function of the collision energy for the BW2
potential for all possible channels are presented in Figure 1. As
shown in Figure 1, the behavior of the reaction probabilities
for the two channels is quite different. One can see from Figure
1 that the reaction probability for the abstraction channel is much
higher than that of the exchange channel.

In the entrance channel of the H + HCl f H2+Cl reaction,
a van der Waals (vdW) well with a collinear geometry and a
depth of 0.019 eV is found, while in the exit channel, a T-shaped
vdW well with a depth of 0.022 eV is predicted.28 In the
collinear transition state for the abstraction reaction, the heights
of the classical barriers is 0.184 eV for BW2 PES.28 For the
H + ClH exchange reaction, which also has a collinear transition
state, the barrier height is computed to be 0.776 eV for BW2
PES.28 The threshold of the reaction for the exchange channel
is a bit higher than that of the abstraction channel. This can
explain why the two channels show different behavior in
Figure 1.

In addition, we calculated the reaction probabilities for
different total angular moment J for HCl initially in its ground
state. The reaction probabilities as a function of collision energy
for total angular momentum of J ) 0, 8, 18 and 28, are presented
for both channels in Figure 2 and 3. As shown in Figure 2,
generally the values of the reaction probabilities decrease with
an increase of J in the low energy region. However, this is not
always true. For example, the J ) 8, 18 reaction probabilities
exceed the J ) 0 probability at high energies (>0.45 and

>0.9 eV), see Figure 2, while the values of the reaction
probabilities for the abstraction channel decrease with an
increase of J as shown in Figure 3. The threshold of the
probabilities increases with increasing J in both channels.

The effect of the initial reagent rotation excitation on the
reaction probability for the two channels (J ) 0, V ) 0, j ) 1,
3, 5, 7, 9) is shown in Figure 4. As seen from Figure 4, the
reaction probabilities of the abstraction channel decrease with
increasing rotational quantum number j. The decrease may be
due to shape resonances caused by hydrogen tunneling through
a centrifugal barrier, which traps the hydrogen for a finite time.
The reaction probabilities for the exchange channel increase with
increasing J. The increase and the oscillating can perhaps be
explained by a long-range vdW well in both the entrance and
exit channels that is the same as the explanation in ref 12. The
oscillating of the probabilities turns stronger as j increases for
the exchange channel.31 The negative values of the reaction

probabilities in the low energy region is negligible with the
approximate of the theory.

Integral Cross Sections. Next, we calculate the integral cross
section from the initial ground state of HCl on the BW2 surface.
In ref 30, Aoiz and Ban˜ares carried out QCT calculation of the
reaction cross section on the BW2 PES with HCl initially in its
state (V ) 0, j ) 0-6). The calculated cross sections for H +
HCl are depicted in Figure 5 for both channels. As can be seen,
the present cross section in the abstraction channel is systemati-
cally larger than the results of QCT30 and the corresponding
experimental values. For the exchange channel, the results from
the QCT calculations cross with the ones from the TDWP
calculations at 1.2 eV, and the threshold energy of the QCT
results is much higher than the one from this work. The
threshold energy of the TDWP results is much lower than the
reaction barrier for this channel (0.8 eV). This can be explained
by the fact that the TDWP method has correctly included the

zero-point energy and tunneling effects. Total absolute reaction
cross sections for chlorine atom information, (cid:243)R(1.4 eV) )
(0.35(0.16) Å2, have been measured using a photolytic calibra-
tion method.30 In ref 25, a value of (cid:243)R(1.0) ) (0.34(0.05) Å2
was determined employing vacuum-UV laser-induced fluores-
the
cence for Cl atom detection. However,
agreement is only approximate, bacause the BW2 cross sections
lie outside the experimental points. The experimental values of
(2(1) Å2 reported in ref 9 for Ecol ) 1.6 eV was not included
in Figure 5.

in any case,

At low temperature and collision energies, the tunneling
works most remarkably in the reaction process to make the H
abstraction easier. At high collision energies, the H atom has
more chances to collide with the Cl atom, and the reaction will

produce more HCl; therefore, the result for the exchange channel
increases faster than the one for the abstraction channel. It is
surprising that dynamical calculations on the BW2 PES, which
is based on high-quality ab initio points and clearly more
accurate than any previous PES,28 yield reaction cross sections
for the abstraction channel noticeably larger than the experi-
mental ones.30 No experimental cross sections have been
reported for the exchanged channel of the reaction.30

Rate Constant. Despite several measurements of relative
reaction rates, accurate results for absolute rate constants have
dodged investigators for many years. So, the rate constant
calculations are also one of our main objectives.

One has to calculate the total reaction probability for more
than two values of J to obtain a more accurate rate constant.32

A very accurate rate constant can be obtained by using reaction
probabilities evaluated at more than 6 values of J (partial waves).
The HCl initially in its state (V ) 0, j ) 0) had been considered
in the calculation of K(T).

The calculated rate constants for the H + HCl reaction are
depicted in Figure 6 for both channels. The calculation of the
thermal rate constants is in the range of temperatures between
200 and 1000 K. One can see that the calculated rate constant
of the abstraction channel is systematically larger than that of
the exchange channel for all the temperatures. As can be seen,
the present rate constants roughly follow the same as the
corresponding experimental values in the range of [10-17, 10-12]
cm3s-1. 2,26,27,39-41 However, in any case, the agreement is only
approximate, because the rate constants on BW2 PES lie inside
the range of experimental values. The agreement of the results
is presented here, and the experimental results are good enough,
but the BW2 PES need improvement of the theoretical results.
The calculated rate constant can also be taken as an indication
that the existence of quantum effects such as tunneling effect
may play an important role. So, according to our calculation
results here, possible reasons for the nonlinear behavior of the
Arrhenius plots of the reactions should be the combination
influence of tunneling effects.

One can predict that the rate constants of the exchange
channel from calculated reaction probabilities should also be
smaller. This feature is usually found for exothermic reactions
with a low energy barrier.42,43

4. Conclusions

In this work, we have applied the TDWP approach to study
the H + HCl reaction on the BW2 PES. We have investigated
the reaction probabilities as a function of the collision energy
for the both channels for the H + HCl reaction and studied the
influence of the initial rotational state excitation of the reagents.
In the low temperature and collision energy range, the tunneling
works most remarkably in the reaction process to make the H
abstraction easier. In the high temperature and collision energy
region, the H atom has more chances to collide with the Cl
atom, and the reaction will produce more HCl. Thus, the cross
section for exchange channel increases faster than that of
abstraction channel. Such a study provides a clear and simple
picture about reaction mechanisms.

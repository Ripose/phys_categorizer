Controlled fusion with advanced fuels requires average electron  and ion energies above 
100 keV (equivalent to 1.1 billion K) in a dense plasma.  We have met this requirement 
and demonstrated electron and ion energies over 100 keV in a compact and inexpensive 
dense plasma focus device.  We have achieved this in plasma "hot spots" or plasmoids 
that,  in  our  best  results,  had  a  density-confinement-time-energy  product  of  5.0 
x1015 keVsec/cm3,  a  record  for  any  fusion  experiment.    We  measured  the  electron 
energies with an X-ray detector instrument that demonstrated conclusively that the hard 
X-rays were generated by the hot spots. 

1. Introduction 

Controlled  fusion  with  advanced  fuels,  especially  hydrogen-boron-11,  is  an  extremely 
attractive  potential  energy  source.    Such  fuels  generate  nearly  all  their  energy  in  the 
form  of  charged  particles,  not  neutrons,  thus  minimizing  or  eliminating  induced 
radioactivity.  They also allow direct conversion of charged- particle energy to electric 
power,  without  the  expensive  intermediate  step  of  generating  steam  for  turbines.[1-3]  
However,  fusion  with  such  fuels  requires  average  electron  and  ion  energies  above 
100 keV (equivalent to 1.1 billion K) in a dense plasma.  We have met this requirement 
and  demonstrated  electron  and  ion  energies  over  100  keV  in  a  dense  plasma  focus 
device which is compact and inexpensive.  We have achieved this in plasma "hot spots" 
or plasmoids that, in our best results, had a density-confinement-time-energy product of 
5.0 x1015 keVsec/cm3, a record for any fusion experiment and a factor of ten above the 
best  achieved  in  the  much  larger  Tokamak  experiments.[4]    To  do  this,  we  used  a 
higher-than-usual  operating  pressure  for  the  device,  which  increased  particle  energy.

We  measured  the  electron  energies  with  an  X-ray  detector  instrument  that  eliminated 
previously-existing doubts that the hard X-rays were generated by the hot spots. 

The dense plasma focus (DPF), first invented in 1954, is far more compact and 
economical than other controlled-fusion devices.  It consists of two coaxial cylindrical 
electrodes  usually  less  than  30  cm  in  all  dimensions  in  a  gas-filled  vacuum  chamber 
connected to a capacitor bank.  The total cost of such a device is under $500,000, for a 
500 kJ system.  It is capable of producing high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray radiation 
and  intense  beams  of  electrons  and  ions,  as  well  as  abundant  fusion  reactions.[5]    In 
operation,  the  capacitors  discharge  in  a  several-microsecond  pulse,   the  gas  is  ionized 
and a current sheath, consisting of pinched current filaments, forms and runs down the 
electrodes.    When  the  sheath  reaches  the  end  of  the  inner  electrode  (the  anode),  the 
filaments  pinch 
together,  forming  dense,  magnetically-confined,  hot  spots  or 
plasmoids.[6-8]    The  plasmoids  emit  soft  X-rays  with  energy  in  the  range  of  several 
kiloelectron volts.  X-ray pinhole images have demonstrated that the plasmoids are tiny, 
with radii of a few microns to tens of microns.[9-10]   The plasmoids have densities in 
the  range  of  1020  -  1021  /cm3  .    These  densities  have  been  measured  in  a  number  of 
independent  methods  including  heavy  ion  fusion[11],  CO2  laser  scattering[12],  and  x-
ray line intensities[13]. 

These  plasmoids  emit  intense  beams  of  accelerated  ions  and  electrons[14-15].   

The electron beam transfers part of its energy to the plasmoid electrons, which generate 
X-rays through collisions with nuclei.  Through a plasma instability, the electrons then 
transfer  part  of  their  energy  to  the  ions,  with  a  typical  delay  (in  our  experiments)  of 
~10 ns.  Ion collisions, generating fusion reactions and neutrons, then occur through the 
intersection  of  trapped  beams[16].    When  the  ion  and  electron  beams  have  exhausted 
the  magnetic  energy  that confines the plasmoid, and partially or wholly evacuated the 
particles in the plasmoid, the fusion reactions end. 

The  DPF  routinely  produces  hard  X-rays  and  gamma  rays  indicating  the 
presence  of  bremsstrahlung  radiation  from  high-energy  electrons  colliding  with 
nuclei[17].    Together  with  independent  evidence,  this  led  us  and  other  researchers  to 
believe that the hot spots contained ions and electrons at very high energies in the range 
of interest for advanced fuel fusion [11,18-19]. However, most researchers in the field 
have believed that the hard radiation was generated not in the plasma itself but by the 
electron  beam  when  it  strikes  the  end  of  the  anode,  and  that  the  hot  spot  plasma  was 
relatively  cool  with  electron  energies  of  only  several  kiloelectron  volts,  too  low  for 
hydrogen-boron  fusion[20].    This  key  question  remained  unresolved  by  previous 
experiments.  

2. Experimental set-up 

To clearly  distinguish  between  the radiation  from  the anode  end  and  that from 
the  plasmoids,  we  used  a  cylindrical  anode  with  6-cm-deep  recess  at  the  pinch  end 
(Fig.1).  In this manner, the point where the electrons hit the anode, generating gamma 
rays, would be separated in space from the plasmoids, which are located at the plasma 
pinch  very  close  to  the  end  of  the  anode.    We  blocked  the  line  of  sight  between  the 
bottom  of  the  hole  and  a  set  of  X-ray  detectors  with  a  5-cm-thick  lead  brick.    This 

 

3

reduced  the  intensity  of  1  Mev  gamma  rays  by  50-fold.    The  line  of  sight  from  the 
plasmoids to the x-ray detectors, in contrast, passed through a 1-mm Be window, which 
allowed all but the lowest energy X-rays (below 1 keV) to pass. 

The experiments were performed at the Texas A&M University DPF facility that 
used a 268 microfarad capacitor bank, charged to either 30 or 35 kV.  We used a shorter 
anode than is customary to increase the fill pressure which we anticipated on theoretical 
grounds  would  increase  the  plasmoid  density  and  particle  energy[19].    The  cathode 
radius was 8.6 cm, anode radius 5.1 cm, anode length 24 cm, and insulator length 7.5 
cm.  A slotted knife-edge around the insulator base was employed to enable operation at 
the higher pressure.  Shots were fired using fill gases of deuterium, helium or helium-
deuterium mixtures at a 50-50 ratio by ion number.  At 30 kV, optimal fill pressure was 
12  torr  for  D,  14  torr  for  He-D  and  16  torr  for  He.    Peak  current  was  typically  1.2-
1.3 MA at 30 kV and 1.4-1.5 MA at 35 kV. 

To  measure  the  energy  of  the  X-rays  and  infer  the  electron  energy,  we  placed 
300-micron,  3-mm  and 6-mm  thick  copper  filters  in front of the three X-ray detectors 
(NE102 scintillators with photomultiplier tubes (PMT)).  The ratio of X-ray intensity at 
a given instant recorded behind the 6mm filter to that recorded behind the 300 micron 
filter provided a measure of average X-ray energy, since only the more energetic X-rays 
could  penetrate  the  thicker  filter.  We  calculated  average  electron  energy  Te  by 
comparing the ratio of the 6 mm/300 micron-filtered signals observed to that calculated 
for  bremsstrahlung  emitted  by  Maxwellian  distributions  of  electrons  at  different 
electron temperatures.  We used the ratio of the 3-mm signal to the 300-micron signal to 
test  if  the  energy  distribution  was  Maxwellian  or  non-Maxwellian.  We  used  remote 
scintillators  and  PMTs  at  9.0  and  17.4  meters  that  were  shielded  by  5-cm  thick  lead 
bricks to measure the gamma ray pulses from the anode end, and the neutrons produced 
by deuterium fusion. 

To eliminate the possibility that radiation from off-axis sources passed through 
the  chamber  wall,  in  later  shots  we  also  blocked  the  sides  of  the  detectors  with  lead 
bricks.  However, results from earlier shots were very similar to those from later shots, 
so  all  data  was  used.    Electrical  noise  from  the  pinch  was  suppressed  with  aluminum 
foil  shielding,  but  still  interfered  with  the  X-ray  signals  on  some  shots.    Our  analysis 
utilized only the shots with a S/N ratio of more than 8 to 1.  Shots with lower S/N had 
higher Te, so their exclusion does not affect our conclusions.  In the D and D-He shots, 
confusion  of  X-ray  and  neutron  signals  was  avoided  since  the  neutrons  reached  the 
detectors  140ns  after  the  X-ray  signals  and  were  relatively  small  due  to  the  1-2  mm 
thickness of the X-ray scintillators. 

The remote scintillators were calibrated for neutron detection against calibrated 
silver  activation  neutron  counters.    Their  sensitivity  to  gamma  rays  and  x-rays  was 
calculated based on data in the literature that related neutron to X-ray and gamma-ray 
sensitivity[21-22].  They were cross calibrated with the X-ray detectors (by measuring 
output  from  the  same  shot  with  all  lead  bricks  removed),  providing  an  absolute 
calibration of the X-ray detectors.  The X-ray detectors were cross-calibrated with each 
other in several shots with the filters removed.  Relative calibration measurements were 

4 

 

3. Results 

3.1 Electron energy 

consistent to within 10%.  The accuracy of the absolute neutron calibrations, and thus of 
the absolute X-ray calibrations, is estimated to be better than 30%. 

In all but one of the eight shots with highest signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio, average 
electron energy Te exceeded 100 keV and peak Te generally exceeded 150 keV. (Table 
1)  (Calibration  uncertainties  of  ±10%  imply  ±20% errors in Te.)  A high Te is vital in 
hydrogen-boron  fusion,  since  the  ions  must  have  still  higher  energy,  and  at  the  very 
high densities required for net energy production collisions with electrons with average 
Te  below  100-125  keV  will  cool  ions  too  rapidly.    By  comparison,  Te  in  Tokamak 
Fusion Test Reactor experiments was, at most, 11.5 keV. 

The  good  agreement  between  peak  Te  calculated  from 

the  ratio  of 
6mm/300 microns  and  that  calculated  from  the  ratio  of  3  mm/300  microns  shows  that 
the  results  are  consistent  with  a  Maxwellian  distribution.  (Fig.2)    However,  they  are 
also  consistent  within  calibration  errors  with  monoenergetic  electrons.    In  this  case, 
average Te would range from 180 keV to 300 keV rather than from 80 keV to 215 keV 
for Maxwellian distributions. 

The  lead shields distinguished the X-rays generated by the plasmoids from the 
gamma  rays  coming  from  the  anode  tip.    This  demonstrated  that  we  were  indeed 
measuring electron energy in electrons trapped in the plasmoids, not just in the electrons 
in the beam.  As measured by the remote scintillators, the gamma ray pulse signals were 
between 60 and 180 times smaller than the x-ray peaks so they could not affect the x-
ray  results.  (Fig.3)    For  many  of  the  shots, including all the  He  shots, the  gamma  ray 
pulses were  not  observable at  all  with the  shielded  detectors.    In  addition,  the gamma 
ray  pulses  did  not  resemble  the  x-ray  pulses,  being  4-6  times  shorter  in  duration 
(FWHM)  with  rise  times  generally  15  times  faster.    Finally,  the  fact  that  the  X-ray 
pulses  were  not  detectable  when  filtered  by  the  lead  brick  confirms  that  the  X-ray 
energy is concentrated below 600 keV, in contrast to the more than 1 MeV gamma rays 
from the anode.  

3.2 Plasma density 

These  results  show  clearly  that  the  high  energy  X-rays  are  emitted  from  high-
energy electrons within the plasma.  But do they come from the high-density plasmoids 
or do they come from a larger volume at lower density?  

We have determined the density of the plasma that produces the neutrons by the 
DD reaction.  There is strong evidence that this is the same volume that traps the high-
energy electrons and produces the hard X-ray radiation (see Sect. 3.4).  In 25% of the 
deuterium  shots  at  optimum  fill  pressure  (two  out  of  eight),  we  have  observed  14.1 
MeV  neutrons.    These  14.1  MeV  neutrons  are  produced  by  the  fusion  of  deuterium 
nuclei  with  tritons  produced  by  DD  fusion  reactions  and  then  trapped  in  the  high-
density  regions  by  strong  magnetic  fields.    This  was  observed  in  one  of  the  two 
deuterium  shots  with  the  best  X-ray  data  (shot  81602),  as  well  as  in  one  shot  (shot 

 

5

80910) that was made before the X-ray detectors were functional.  Shot 80910 also had 
the highest number of DD neutrons. 

In these two shots, the ratio of the number of 14.1 MeV neutrons to the number 
of  2.45  MeV  neutrons  provides  a  direct  measure  of  density.    In  DD  plasma 
approximately 0.9 tritons are produced by the D+D⇒T+p reaction for every 2.45 MeV 
neutron produced by the D+D⇒3He+n reaction.  Thus the ratio of 14.1 Mev neutrons to 
2.45 MeV neutrons is R = 0.9F, where F is the fraction of tritons that undergo fusion.  
Since  

where  <σv>  is  the  average  product  of  the  fusion  cross  section  and  the  triton 
Maxwellian  velocity  distribution,  n  is  the  deuteron  plasma  density  and  τ  is  the 
confinement time for the tritons, therefore  

1) F = <σv>nτ,  

2) n = F/<σv>τ.  

In  both  shots,  the  FWHM  length  of  the  DT  pulse,   τ,  is  10  ns,  significantly 
longer than the minimum width set by instrumental response times.  (The recovery time 
of  the  scintillator  and  PMT  is  <1  ns, but since data is taken every 2 ns, the minimum 
pulse width observable is 4ns and still well under the 10 ns recorded.) The very short 
pulse  duration  also  implies  a  small  spread  in  triton  velocity  relative  to  the  axis  of  the 
DPF.  (The lines of sight to the neutron detectors are perpendicular to that axis.)  This is 
consistent  with  the  model  of  the  plasmoid  developed  by  Bostick,  Nardi  and  other 
researchers  and  confirmed  by  x-ray  pinhole  images[10]  in  which  the  plasmoid  has  an 
"apple  core"  structure  aligned  with  the  DPF  axis.    Tritons  contained  by  the  strong 
magnetic fields within the plasmoid encounter the highest density plasma, and thus the 
most  chance  for  fusion  reactions  while  traveling  along  the  plasmoid  axis,  and  much 
lower density while re-circulating through the outer region of the plasmoid. 

In shot 81602, F = 6.6±1x10-3and for shot 80910, F = 5.4±1.8x10-4.  The shot-to-
shot  variability  is  typical  of  DPF  functioning  without  optimization,  which  was  not 
possible for this set of experiments.  We calculated n on the assumption that the tritons 
did  not  slow  down  significantly  from  their  initial  1.01  MeV  energy  during  the 
confinement  time,  and  that  DT  neutron  production  was  terminated  as  the  plasmoid 
density decayed. Even at a density of 3.3x1021/cm3, the energy loss time for tritons in 
ion-ion  collisions  is  55  ns,  much  longer  than  τ,  supporting  the  assumption  that  the 
tritons have not slowed substantially by the end of the pulse. The energy loss time for 
the tritons at the same density in collisions with electrons at 100 keV energy is longer 
still,  350  ns.   (A beam-plasma interaction that slows the tritons collectively cannot be 
entirely ruled out, although we believe it unlikely.  If the tritons are slowed down to low 
energies during the 10 ns pulse, the reaction rate could be increased by as much as 3.5, 
reducing the calculated density by the same factor.) 

  Given  the  above  assumption,  n  =  3.3±0.5x1021/cm3  for  shot  81602  and 
2.8±0.9x1020/cm3 for shot 80910.  This also assumes, conservatively, that all the T has 
been produced prior to the DT neutron pulse.  This result represents a peak density.  We 

6 

 

take  the  average density  to  be half  these  values,  1.6±0.2x1021/cm3 for shot  81602  and 
1.4±0.5x1020/cm3 for shot 80910. 

in  either 

We have ruled out any source for the DT neutrons other than a dense plasmoid 
where the tritons are produced, along with the DD neutrons.  Collisions of tritons with 
deuterated  metal 
the  anode,  even  assuming 
the  chamber  wall  or 
(unrealistically) that there is one deuterium atom for every copper or iron atom, would 
produce a burn fraction F of <2.7x10-5.  This is a factor of 10 less than that observed for 
shot  80910  and  a  factor  of  120  less  than  that  observed  for  shot  81602.    The  tritons 
ejected in the ion beam will hit a copper target which is not in the detector line-of-sight, 
further  reducing  any  possible  beam-target  contribution  to  the  DT  neutrons.    The  DT 
neutron  detection  cannot  possibly  be  cosmic  rays  or  other  noise  sources.    The  delay 
time  between  the  DT  neutron  peak  at  the  9  meter  detector  and  that  at  the  17.4  meter 
detector is identical (with the 2 ns measurement window) to that for 14.1 MeV neutrons 
in  shot  81602 and differs by only 4 ns (1%) for shot 80910.  There are no other such 
pulses  at  unrelated  times  (except  for  the  much  earlier  gamma  ray  pulse).    While  the 
number  of  neutrons  actually  detected  is  not  large  (7  for  shot  81602  and  3  for  shot 
80910),  even  a  single  14.1  MeV  neutron  produced  a  pulse  four  times  the  instrument 
noise level.  The isotropic distribution of the neutrons is indicated by their detection at 
both detectors, which are 90 degrees apart in azimuthal direction. 

3.3 Plasmoid volume and confirmation of density 

Measurements of X-ray emitted power and Te for shot 81602 give us that  

3) n2V = 1.5x1034/cm3,  

where V is the volume of the reacting region.  

Therefore,  V  is  5.5x10-9  cm3,  indicating  a  core  radius  of  6  microns  and  an 
overall  plasmoid  radius  of  24  microns.    This  is  comparable  to  the  dimensions  of 
hotspots  observed  with  pinhole  X-ray  cameras  in  many  previous  plasma  focus 
experiments[6-8].  

We did not attempt to directly measure the source size of the high energy X-rays 
in these experiments.  There are difficulties with measuring the radius of the source of 
high-energy X-rays.  Use of a pinhole camera is routine for low-energy X-rays.  For a 
reasonable  field  of  view,  a  pinhole  must  be  cut  in  material  that  is  thinner  than  the 
pinhole diameter.  However, to have adequate contrast for X-ray energy above 100 keV, 
the  lead  thickness  must  be  >200  microns,  so  resolution  of  tens  of  microns  cannot  be 
obtained in this manner.  (After our experiment, Castillo-Mejia et al,[23] using an image 
intensifier,  published  results  demonstrating  that  the  source  size  of  hard  x-rays  in  their 
smaller PDF was of the order of 10 microns.  In this experiment, however, they did not 
distinguish between X-rays from the plasmoids and gamma rays from the electron beam 
collision with the anode.) 

For  shot  81602,  measurement  of  the  emitted  ion  beam  provides  indirect 
confirmation  of  the  density  estimate.  Measurements  with  a  10  cm  diameter  Rogowski 
coil located at 65 cm from the end of the anode showed that the ion beam had a peak 

 

7

current  of  140  A  and  total  ion  number  of  8.8x1012.  Since  the  number  of  ions  in  the 
plasmoids  nV  must  equal  or  exceed  the  number  of  ions  in  the  beam,  these 
measurements can combine with n2V to set an upper limit on n of 1.7x1021/cm3.  This 
result is essentially identical to our estimate from DT neutrons, implying that essentially 
all the ions are evacuated into the beam. 

This observed  equality  of  the  ion  number  in  the plasmoid and in the ion beam 
allows us to estimate the density of other shots that did not yield DT neutrons. We can 
do  this  by  dividing  the  n2V  measured  in  each  shot  through  X-ray  or  neutron 
observations  by  the  beam  ion  number.  This  analysis  indicates  that  n  ranges  from  0.9-
3.0x1020/cm3,  with  an  average  of  1.5x1020/cm3  for  He  shots  and  2.5x1020/cm3  for  D 
shots.  These values are also consistent with the non-observation of DT neutrons in the 
other D shots.  The factor of ten variations between best n and average n is typical of 
DPF functioning without extensive optimization. 

The  high  densities  measured  in  this  experiment  are  quite  comparable  to  those 
measured  by  a  variety  of  techniques  in  other  DPF  research[11-13]  and  are  not  in 
themselves  surprising.    Many  research  teams  have  observed  the  same  1020-1021  /cm3 
range with similar operating conditions.  However, the present experiments are the first 
in which Te >100keV are associated with such high plasma densities.  

At  these  high  densities,  electron-electron  collisional  heating  is  rapid,  so  there 
cannot  be  a  cool  background  plasma  with  a  high-energy  component,  meaning 
essentially all the electrons must be energetic.  For 200keV electrons with a density of 
1.4x1020 the electron heating time is only 6 ns, considerably shorter than the typical 20-
50 ns x-ray pulse duration, and for n = 1.7x1021 (shot 81602) the heating time is only 
0.5 ns. 

3.4 Ion energy and confinement time 

Not only is Te high in these plasmoids, but so is Ti, ranging from 45 to 210 keV. 
(These  Ti  assume  a  Maxwellian  distribution  of ion energies.  For monoenergetic ions, 
the  range  would  be  from  90  to  350  keV)[24].    For  comparison,  the  ideal  Ti  for 
hydrogen-boron fusion is 600 keV.  For Ti =145keV, the reaction rate is one third of its 
maximum.  The highest Ti achieved by TFTR was 44 keV [4].  

 

Ti and τ for the DD neutron production pulses were determined as follows. The 
FWHM of the neutron pulse was measured at 9 meters and at 17.4 meters.  We made 
the simplifying assumption that the velocity distribution was Maxwellian.  On that basis  

4) FWHM2 =  τ2+(t2Ti/2E),  

where t is the transit time for a neutron of energy E to reach the detector and Ti 
is the ion temperature, averaged over the duration of the pulse.  (While it is unlikely the 
velocity  distribution  is  in  fact  Maxwellian,  monoenergetic  ions  would  produce  a 
different shaped neutron pulse than is observed, so a Maxwellian approximation appears 
roughly accurate.) 

8 

 

For shot 81602, Ti is 55 kev and ion confinement time τ is 54 ns.  On this basis, 
nτ for  this  shot  is  9.2x1013  sec/cm3  and  nτTi  is 5x1015 keVsec/cm3, a record value for 
any  fusion  experiment.    Simultaneous  X-ray  observations  show  an  average  Te  of  145 
keV.    For  other  shots,  which  have  smaller  n  but  larger  τ and Ti,  nτTi  is  typically 
1x1015 keVsec/cm3. 

There is abundant evidence that the high-energy electrons that produce the hard 
X-rays  do  in  fact  originate  in  the  same  dense  hot  spots  that  produce  the  neutrons.  
Therefore Ti, Te and n are all high in same time and space.  The X-ray pulses are closely 
correlated  in  time  and  duration  with  the  neutron  pulses,  overlapping  with  them  in  all 
cases, and with the X-ray peak preceding the center of the neutron pulse by only 5-18 ns 
(average 10 ns).  The DT pulse peak for shot 81602 is within 4 ns of the X-ray pulse 
peak.  The duration of the x-ray pulses and neutron pulses are closely correlated, with 
X-ray pulse duration, always 0.4-0.55 that of the neutron pulse.  In addition, from the 
neutron  production,  pulse  duration,  and  Ti,  the  quantity  n2V  was  calculated  for  each 
deuterium shot.  The same quantity can be calculated from Te and X-ray power for the 
two D shots with high X-ray signal to noise.  The average n2V derived from the neutron 
data is 1.7x1034/cm3, while that derived from the X-ray data is 2.2x1034/cm3, essentially 
identical. For shot 81602 the n2V of 1.5x1034/cm3 derived from X-ray data is essentially 
identical  to  the  1.6x1034/cm3  that  can  be  derived  from  DD  neutron  emission,  neutron 
pulse  duration  and  ion  energy  Ti.  These  would  be  extraordinary  coincidences  if  the 
neutrons and X-rays did not in fact originate from the same volume of plasma. 

The high density-confinement-time product is important for fusion performance 
since it is directly proportional to the fraction of fusion fuel burned.  For comparison the 
best nτTi achieved in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor was 5.5x1014 keVsec/cm3 with 
Ti of 44 keV and Te of only 11.5 keV[4].   (Of course, total fusion energy produced was 
orders of magnitude less than TFTR in our much more modest experiment, as was the 
cost of the experiment.) 

4. Conclusions 

The Ti and Te achieved in these shots already match those needed for hydrogen- 
boron fusion.  For the He shots, the atomic mass is close to the average atomic mass of 
pB11.  Theoretical studies have shown that collisions with the alpha particle products of 
pB11 fusion preferentially heat boron ions faster than electrons for Te > 125 keV[19].  
With  an  nτ  of  2x1015  sec/cm3,  a  factor  of  20  above  that  achieved  here,  a  large  gap 
between ion and electron temperature will be created, allowing fusion energy to heat the 
plasmoid  faster  than  X-ray  emission  cools  it.    Since  nτ  increases  in  DPF  as  I2,  these 
conditions should be achievable with optimized electrodes for I of 3-5 MA. 

These  results  show  the  potential  of the  DPF  as  a  possible  device for  advanced 
fuel fusion.  Further work will be required to increase the efficiency of energy transfer 
into the plasmoid, which is low in these shots.  Such high efficiency has been achieved 
with  other  DPF  experiments[25],  but  not  with  the  high  density  or  particle  energy 
achieved  in  these  experiments.    However,  optimization  of  electrode  design,  which  we 
were  not  able  to  accomplish  in  this  experiment,  may  solve  this  problem.    Our  results

show  that  neutron  yield  increases  rapidly  with  increased  sheath  run-down  velocity.  
Therefore,  a  smaller  anode  radius,  which  may  increase  the  B  field  and  run-down 
velocity,  could  increase  efficiency  to  much  higher  levels.    A  combination  of  high  fill 
pressure,  small  anode  radius,  and  high  rundown  velocity  should  be  able  to 
simultaneously  achieve  high  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  as  well  as  the  high  density 
and particle energy needed for advanced fuel fusion.

Fig. 1 In a dense plasma focus, a small plasmoid or hotspot forms near the end of the 
anode, emitting an electron beam towards the anode, an ion beam away from the anode 
as  well  as  x-rays  and  neutrons  from  fusion  reactions.    X-rays  from  the  plasmoid  pass 
through a 1 mm thick Be window to the x-ray detectors, but gamma rays from collisions 
of the electron beam with the anode are blocked by a 5 cm thick lead brick.  Neutrons 
pass through apertures in a 60-cm concrete shield wall to neutron detectors at 9 m and 
17.4 m.  Lines of sight of the two neutron detectors are ~90 degrees apart in azimuthal 
direction.  A Rogowski coil at 65 cm from the anode measures the ion beam.

Fig. 2. X-ray power output(solid line), electron average energy Te calculated from ratio 
of 6mm/300 micron-filtered output(dashed), Te from ratio of 3mm/330 micron filtered 
output (dotted) for a single D shot(shot 81705, 35 kV, 15 torr, 9x109 neutrons).  Te is in 
keV, while x-ray output, measured by 300 micron filtered detector, is in units of 350 W 
total emitted power.  Time unit is 2ns. The close correspondence of the two measures of 
Te  in  the  latter  half  of  the  pulse  is  consistent  with  a  Maxwellian electron distribution, 
while the higher 6mm/300 micron Te in the earlier part of the pulse indicates a broader-
than  Maxwellian  energy  distribution.    Average  Te  for  this  pulse  is  200keV,  and  TI  , 
derived  from  neutron  time  of  flight  measurement,  is  300keV.    Note  that  x-ray  pulse 
duration  and  the  overall  X-ray  energy  emitted  is  considerably  greater  in  this  shot  at 
35kV, with peak current of 1.5 MA than in Fig. 3, at 30kV and 1.3MA, showing rapid 
scaling of X-ray output.

Fig. 3c 

Fig.  3.  (a)  dI/dt  of  device  current(light  dashed),  x-ray  output(heavy  solid),  ion  beam 
current (heavy dashed), Te from 6 mm/300 micron ratio (light solid) , gamma-ray output 
through 5cm lead shield of remote PMT(dotted) from a single D shot (Shot 81602, 30 
kV, 12 torr, 1.0 x1010 neutrons).  Units: dI/dt in 100 A/ns (inverted); x-ray output in  2 
kW;  ion  beam  current  in  5  A;  Te  in  10  keV;  gamma  ray  output  in  20  W  of  power 
through  the  shield.    All traces  are  referred  to  time of  radiation  from  the  pinch  region.  
The shielded gamma ray pulse is far smaller than the unshielded x-ray pulses and differs 
from  it  in  shape  and  timing.    The  gamma  ray  pulse  generated  by  the  electron  beam 
hitting  the  anode  and  the  ion  beam  are  clearly  correlated  as  both  are  with  the  dI/dt 
pinch.  Heating of the electrons in the plasmoid continues as the beam tails off, reaching 
a peak 14 ns later.  Energy transferred to the ions leads to neutron emission (b) (kW of 
total neutron power).  The broadening of the neutron peak, due to the energy spread of 
the  neutrons,  has  been  compensated  for,  although  the  peak  is  probably  somewhat 
shorter in duration than portrayed here.  In this shot, near the peak of neutron power, 14 
MeV neutrons are emitted from collisions of a beam of trapped tritium with deuterium 
(c) (kW of DT neutron power). This occurs only 4 ns after the X-ray peak.

Metal-based negative refractive index materials have been extensively studied in the microwave 

region. However, negative-index metamaterials have not been realized at near-IR or visible fre-

quencies due to difficulties of fabrication and to the generally poorer optical properties of metals 

at these wavelengths. In this paper, we report the first fabrication and experimental verification 

of a transversely structured metal-dielectric-metal multilayer exhibiting a negative refractive in-

dex around 2 µm. Both the amplitude and the phase of the transmission and reflection were 

measured experimentally, and are in good agreement with a rigorous coupled wave analysis.

Negative refractive-index materials are of great interest for a variety of potential applica-

tions.1 Because natural negative refractive index materials do not exist, artificial structures have 

been  proposed  and  fabricated  that  exhibit  an  effective  negative  index  over  limited  frequency 

ranges.2 The two principal approaches to the realization of negative refraction are metamaterials 

and photonic crystals. Metamaterials typically use metallic structures to provide a negative per-

mittivity and use resonant structures (inductor-capacitor tank circuits) with a scale much smaller 

than  the  wavelength  to  provide  a  negative  permeability  leading  to  negative  refraction,  while

photonic crystals exhibit negative refraction as a consequence of band-folding effects. In the mi-

crowave region, negative index materials have been demonstrated using both approaches, while 

in  the  visible  spectral  region,  negative  refraction  has  been  recently  predicted.3  In  recent  work, 

magnetically resonant structures exhibiting negative permeability have been demonstrated in the 

mid-infrared.4,5 Despite theoretical studies and numerical modeling,6,7 demonstration of negative 

refraction at near-infrared (near-IR) and visible wavelengths is as yet missing and, therefore, the 

experimental demonstration of a negative refractive index around 2 µm presented here represents 

an important milestone. 

Extension of metamaterials based on split ring resonators8 to near-IR and visible wave-

lengths necessarily involves complicated and often difficult fabrication for the nanoscale metallic 

structures  used  to  generate  the  requisite  resonances.  On  the  other  hand,  much  of  the  photonic 

crystal literature has focused on all-dielectric structures because of their low-loss characteristics. 

Recent related work has used periodic metallic structures to couple incident radiation to surface 

plasma waves giving enhanced optical transmission through arrays of sub-wavelength holes in a 

metal  film.9,10  In  this  work,  a  hybrid  approach  is  introduced  which  uses  a  pair  of  metal  layers 

separated  by  a  dielectric 

to  provide  resonant 

interactions  (e.  g.  distributed 

induc-

tance/capacitance) along with a periodic array of holes through the film stack to facilitate interac-

tion with the surface plasma waves of the composite structure. 

The structure consists of a glass substrate with two metallic films (30-nm thick Au) sepa-

rated  by  a  dielectric  layer  (60-nm  thick  Al2O3)  with  a  2-dimensional,  square  periodic  array  of 

circular holes (period 838 nm; hole diameter ~ 360 nm) perforating the entire multi-layer struc-

ture.  A  schematic  and  a  SEM  picture  of  the  fabricated  structure  are  shown  in  Fig.  1.  As  illus-

trated in Fig. 1(a), the structure can be roughly divided into two functional parts. The incident 

magnetic field interacts primarily with the hatched regions. The top and bottom metal films form 

a loop (inductor) and, where the induced current is interrupted by the hole, along with the capaci-

tive  coupling  between  the  two  films  give  a  resonant  response  very  similar  to  that  recently  re-

ported  for  Au  “staple”  structures.5 In the  vicinity  of  the  resonance, this tank circuit  provides a 

magnetization field opposite to that of the incident wave and, therefore, a reduced permeability. 

The dark regions dominate the electric field response forming a wire grid polarizer that cancels 

the field in the metal and results in a negative permittivity.  

The  fabrication  procedure  is  as  follows.  First,  a  thick  layer  of  anti-reflection  coating 

(ARC) and negative photo-resist (PR) is spun onto a glass substrate. Interferometric lithography 

with 355-nm UV source (third-harmonic of a YAG laser) is used to define a 2D array of holes in 

the PR at a pitch of 838 nm.11 Titanium is then deposited on the wafer by e-beam evaporation, 

followed by a lift-off process to remove the PR and leave an array of Ti dots on top of the ARC. 

Reactive ion etching (RIE) with oxygen gas is used to etch through the ARC layer using the Ti 

dots as a selective etch mask, followed by three evaporations: 30 nm of Au, 60 nm of Al2O3, (the 

refractive index is about 1.65), and 30 nm of Au. Finally, a second lift-off process is carried out 

to remove the remaining ARC forming the final structure. The overall sample size was ~ 1 cm2, 

providing a large area for measurements of the optical properties. This large-area nanoscale fab-

rication is a significant advantage of the parallel interferometric lithography patterning approach 

as compared with serial patterning techniques such as e-beam lithography. 

In  order  to  unambiguously  determine  the  effective  propagation  constant  (and  hence  re-

fractive  index)  of  this  composite  structure,  it  is  necessary  to  measure  both  the  amplitude  and 

phase of the film transmission and reflection. The phase information is not available from meas-

urements on a blanket metamaterial film (sample A). Two “metamaterial phase masks” (Fig. 2) 

were fabricated to allow interferometric measurement of this phase information. The first, sam-

ple B, consisted of stripes of the composite multi-layer patterned structure alternating with open 

area stripes at a pitch of 16 µm and was used for transmission phase measurements. For the re-

flection phase measurements (sample C), the blank areas are replaced with Au reflecting stripes 

atop the metamaterials at a finer pitch of 4.7 µm. 

The  transmission  and  reflectance  measurements  were  performed  using  a  Fourier  trans-

form infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The transmission measurement is carried out at normal inci-

dence to the wafer and the transmission through a clean BK7 glass wafer was used as the back-

ground spectrum to which the experimental spectra are normalized. For reflectance, the incident 

beam is incident on the wafer at 11° from the surface normal. For both measurements, unpolar-

ized incident light is used because the structure is symmetric with respect to polarization at near 

normal  incidence.  The  periods  of  the  phase-masks  were  chosen  so  that  only  the  zero-order 

transmission  (reflection)  from  the  samples  is  collected  and  the  higher  order  diffracted  light  is 

outside the numerical aperture of the FTIR optical system. This provides a near zero-path length 

interferometric measurement of the phase of the transmission (reflection) coefficient referenced 

to the blank (metal) regions, even using the FTIR broadband source.  

The transmission spectra of samples A and B are shown in Fig. 3(a) along with the rigor-

ous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) modeling results (Fig. 3(b)) for sample A. The reflectance 

spectra of samples A and C are shown in Fig. 3(c) and the RCWA modeling for sample A are 

shown in Fig. 3(d). RCWA is a widely used algorithm for analysis of scattering electromagnetic 

waves from periodic structures.12,13 The structure was modeled as an array of square holes (330 

nm side dimension), which converged computationally faster than a model using round holes.  

For sample A, the sharp structures in the transmittance and reflectance curves at about 1.3 

µm  correspond  to  the  surface  plasma  wave  at  the  glass:Au  interface.  The  longer  wavelength 

resonance at about 2 µm is attributed to the L-C circuit resonance described above in connection 

with the magnetic response. The multi-layer film stack also exhibits a surface plasma wave reso-

nance  in  this  spectral  vicinity  associated  with  the  Al2O3:Au  surface  plasma  wave  shifted  to 

longer  wavelength  by  coupling  between  the  adjacent  Al2O3:Au  interfaces.  The  connection  be-

tween  these  interrelated  phenomena  will  be  discussed  in  more  detail  in  a  future  publication. 

There is a dip in the transmission of sample B around 2 µm, which means that the light going 

through  the  two  regions  interferes  destructively,  so  there  must  be  a  significant  variation  in  the 

phase of the light transmitted through the metamaterial near that wavelength.

where ωp = 1.37x1016 Hz is the plasma frequency and ωc = 4.08x1013 Hz is the scattering fre-

quency  for  bulk  gold.14  The  thin  metallic  film  (30  nm)  in  our  device  has  more  surface  and 

boundary  scattering  than  bulk  material  and,  therefore,  likely  exhibits  a  higher  scattering  fre-

quency. Thus, the transmission was modeled with scattering frequencies of 1, 2 and 3 times that 

of bulk gold as shown in Fig. 3(b). The experiment results are best fit by the model with a scat-

tering frequency three times that of bulk gold; this scattering frequency was used in the follow-

ing analysis.

negative index material. There is a remaining ambiguity in the sign of the argument of the co-

sine. Analytically calculating the transmission phase for an unpatterned multilayer structure  at 

long wavelengths ~ 2.5 µm, well beyond the resonance frequency, and comparing it with the ex-

perimental result uniquely resolves this ambiguity. This approach also resolves another problem 

associated with the sensitivity of the analyzed transmission phase ϕA to the relative ratio 

1g  and 

2g   resulting  from  the  very  small  value  of  TA  at  long  wavelengths;  the  analytically  calculated 

phase at long wavelength beyond the resonance is very stable against small variations of the ge-

ometry and of the gold parameters and can be used to narrow the uncertainty in the SEM meas-

urement  of  g1  and  g2.  The  values  used  in  the  fitting  were  well  within  the  measurement  uncer-

tainty. For the extraction of the reflectivity phase, TA and TB are replaced with RA and RC in Eq. 

(1) and the argument of the cosine by φA+2kod-δ, where φA is the reflectance phase angle of the 

negative index material, d is the height difference between the surfaces of the metamaterial and 

the gold; and δ is the optical phase change on reflection from the gold. Because the metal is not a 

perfect conductor, δ is not exactly -π, but is evaluated from the Drude model and is found to be 

insensitive to the variation of the scattering frequency used. We also calculated δ at a number of 

wavelengths from the measured refractive index of gold14 and verified that the Drude model pro-

vides a good approximation. 

Using Eq. (1), the transmission and reflectance phase information is extracted as shown 

in Fig. 4. The measured phase for both transmission and reflectance are in good agreement with 

the modeling results. Finally, we can use the transmission and reflectance amplitude and phase 

measurements to evaluate the metamaterial refractive index (

εµ=n

) and impedance (

εµς=

).

where dm is the thickness of the metamaterial film stack. 

Using Eqs. (2) and (3), the complex value of the effective refractive index of the structures was 

evaluated solely from the experimental data. The results from both measurement and modeling 

are shown in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b), respectively. The real parts are negative over a range of wave-

lengths  around  2  µm,  where  the  imaginary  part  undergoes  a  strong  modulation.  The  minimum 

value of the real part is about -2, while the imaginary part is larger than 3, which means that the 

negative  index  material  exhibits  significant  loss  associated  with  electron  scattering  in  the  thin 

metal films.  

These results are the first experimental demonstration of a metal-dielectric negative index 

material at near-infrared wavelengths. From the results for n and ζ, the effective permeability µeff 

and permittivity εeff can be evaluated (not shown). The real part of µeff shows a strong modulation 

and  the  imaginary  part  has  a  peak  characteristic  of  a  strong  magnetic  resonance  in  the  wave-

length  region  where  n  <  0.  However,  the  minimum  value  of  µeff  is  not  negative  (for  both  the 

measurement and the modeling results) as a result of the large scattering loss. The refractive in-

In summary, the first metal-dielectric negative-index metamaterial at 2 µm, a wavelength 

about 104× smaller than previously reported, has been demonstrated. This near-IR metamaterial 

has  a  high  loss  coefficient  that  could  be  improved  using  lower-loss  metallic  films  or  compen-

sated for by adding a gain material between the two metallic layers. The achievement of negative 

refractive index materials at near-IR and optical frequencies should lead to increased applications 

and will allow more detailed investigation of the interesting properties of NIM since the trans-

verse  sample  scale  is  ~104  wavelengths,  making  edge  effects  insignificant.  Additionally,  this 

work provides a new direction for the design and fabrication of negative refractive index materi-

als  and  highlights  the  advantages  of  large-area  interferometric  patterning  techniques  for  nano-

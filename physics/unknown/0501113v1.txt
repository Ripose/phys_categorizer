Introduction:  Observations  of  the  Kuiper  Belt 
indicate  that  a  larger  than  expected  percentage  of 
KBO’s  (approximately  8  out  of  500)  are  in  binary 
pairs.  The  formation  and  survival  of  such  objects 
presents  a  conundrum  [1].  Two  competing  theories 
have  been  postulated  to  try  to  solve  this  problem. 
One entails the physical collision of bodies [2] while 
the other utilizes dynamical friction or a third body to 
dissipate  excess  momentum  and  energy  from  the 
system [3]. Although in general known binaries  tend 
to  differ  significantly  in  mass,  such  as  seen  in  the 
Earth-Moon  or  asteroid  binary  systems  [4],  Kuiper 
binaries  discovered  to  date  tend  to  instead  be  of 
similar  size  [5,  6].  This  paper  investigates  the 
stability,  development  and  lifetimes  for  Kuiper  Belt 
binaries  by  tracking  their  orbital  dynamics  and 
subsequent  evolution.  Section

numerical  model  while  Section  three  discusses  the 
initial  conditions.  Finally,  in  Section  four  the  results 
are  discussed  with  Section  five  containing 
the 
conclusions.

Numerical  Model:  The  numerical  method 
employed  in  this  work  is  a  5th  order  Runga-Kutta 
algorithm  [7]  based  on  the  Butcher’s  scheme  [8].  A 
fixed  time  step  of  two  days  was  used  in  order  to 
reduce  truncation  and  round-off  errors  while  still 
yielding reasonable CPU run times over a simulation 
period  of  1000  years.  The  forces  considered  include 
the  gravitational  attraction  of  the  Sun,  the  seven 
major planets (Venus through Neptune) and all other 
KBO’s  with  the  corresponding  accelerations  due  to 
these forces given by Eq. (1).

Particles  are  considered  removed  from  the  system 
when  they  venture  beyond  100  AU  or  enter  the 
sphere  of  influence  (SOI)  of  one  of  the  seven  major 
planets.  The  SOI  is  defined  as  the  distance  from  the 
secondary  attractor,  where  bodies  will  interact  with 
one another as opposed to being primarily acted upon 
by the Sun. This is given by Eq. (2),  

   

 (2) 

where  MSecondary  is  the  mass  of  the  planet,  MPrimary  is 
the  mass  of  the  Sun,  and  r  is  the  distance  of 
separation  between 
the  primary  and  secondary 
bodies.  Collisions  between  objects  are  allowed  as  is 
any subsequent KBO size change. 

Initial  Conditions:  The  Kuiper  Belt  is  divided 
into three distinct populations: the classic Kuiper Belt 
Objects,  the  resonant  KBO’s,  and  the  scattered 
KBO’s.  These  simulations  are  representative  of  the 
classic Kuiper Belt population (containing 50% of all 
KBO’s)  where  KBO  orbits  lie  in  the  ecliptic  plane 
and eccentricities are generally less than 0.2 [4]. This 
specific  KBO  population  has  a  size  distribution  for 
which  the  number  density  of  100  km  particles  is  a 
maximum  [5].  Therefore,  a  radius  of  100  km  was 
chosen as the radius for all simulated KBO’s. A mean 
density  of  3.5  g/cm3  was  assumed  (corresponding 
roughly  to  dirty  water  ice)  yielding  individual  KBO 
masses of 1.47x1019 kg. 

A total of 4000 KBO’s  were  initially  arranged as 
2000  binary  pairs  randomly  distributed  between  30 
and  35  AU.  These  2000  binary  pairs  were  divided 
into 10 sets of 200 and assigned orbital eccentricities 
between 0.0 to 0.9 in steps of 0.1. Each pair had their 
initial  position  (and  hence  velocity)  randomized 
about  their  center  of  mass  with  the  center  of  mass 
then  given the velocity it would have had were it in a 
circular  orbit  about  the  Sun.  Figure  1  shows  this 
initial particle distribution. 

Results: Once established, binaries were found to 
be  remarkably  stable  and  were  only  rarely  disrupted 
during  their  subsequent  evolution.  Of  the  2000  pairs 
simulated,  140  collided  with  Neptune  during  the 
1000-year  simulation  period  with  no  collisions 
occurring  between  KBO’s.  Four  quaternary  systems 
and two tertiary systems were formed with 150 years 
left in the simulation, remaining stable throughout the 
remainder  of  the  1000-year  time  period.  It  appears 
the  initial  eccentricity  of  the  KBO  binary  may  be  a 
factor  in  determining  whether  such  higher-level 
systems  will  form  since  initial  eccentricities  below 
0.4  resulted  in  five  of  the  six  multi-particle  systems 
discovered.  It 
that 
throughout  the  1000-year  simulation,  zero  KBO’s 
were ejected into the Oort cloud.

The  final  positions  for  all  KBO’s  tracked  in  this 
simulation  are  shown  in  Fig.  2  with  their  average 
eccentricity  and 
their  minimum  and  maximum 
eccentricities given in Table 1. As can be seen, KBO 
binaries having smaller initial eccentricities generally 
suffer larger perturbations than do those with initially 
larger eccentricities. 

Conclusions:  Presently,  there  are  only  8  known 
the  Kuiper  Belt  constituting 

KBO  binaries 
approximately 4% of the whole. These simulations

predict  binary  disruption  rates  of  approximately  7% 
per  1000  years,  implying  KBO  binary  lifetimes  in 
agreement with previous results [9, 10]. Additionally, 
the appearance of coupled systems consisting of more 
than  two  objects  agrees  with  previous  studies  that 
postulated systems of higher multiplicity could occur 
[3].  It  has  also  recently  been  shown  that  the  particle 
distribution of KBO’s over a specific spatial region is 
related  to  transient  binary  formation  [11].  KBO 
densities on the order of 12/AU2 resulted in transient 
binaries  being 
formed  with  negligible  binary 
formation  found  for  KBO  densities  lower  than 
approximately  2/AU2  (corresponding  to  the  0.35% 
found  in  this  research).  Thus,  the  formation  of 
tertiary  and  quaternary  systems  offers  a  possible 
mechanism for providing the initial density of KBO’s 
required  for  the  formation  of  binary  systems.  The 
above  is  also  in  agreement  with  current  predictions 
that  the  Kuiper  Belt  was  originally  up  to  100  times 

more massive  than it is presently. These possibilities 
will be discussed in upcoming publications.

THE ORIGIN OF GRAVITY

Abstract 

Following  Sakharov’s  and  Puthoff’s  idea  of  an  induced  gravity,  I  consider  a  pair  of  harmonic 
oscillators coupled by the Coulomb and the electrokinetic potential, which decreases as 1/r. Their 
dynamic coupling is allowed in the near field, that is, for frequencies roughly below ~ c/r. I treat 
the problem using Planck’s and Post’s ensemble description of harmonic oscillators. It is found 
that the correlated interacting modes have lower eigenfrequencies and positive zero-modes, their 
anticorrelating counterparts having higher eigenfrequencies and negative zero-modes. Moreover, 
the  former  tend  to  induce  coherent  states  over  large  ensembles  whereas  the  latter  cannot.  This 
applies to all the modes of the near field, as well as to the transverse radiant modes for which a 
retarded interacting correlation can be defined within absorber theory. As a result, an attractive 
long-range potential is found in all the zero-modes of the near field. Since gravitation here results 
from  the  near-field  electromagnetic  potential,  which  is  known  to  be  retarded,  it  follows  that 
gravity  is  also  retarded,  propagates  at  the  speed  of  light  and  has  an  upper  cut-off  longitudinal 
near-field frequency for bodies located at some distance. This result has also applications in the 
ensembles considered by G. Preparata.

The term f  is akin to a spring’s tension and approximates the electrostatic and the 
electrokinetic  attraction  or  repulsion  between  the  neighbouring  charges  of  one 
oscillator  on  a  small  displacement.  We  omitted  the  Lorentz  force  of  the 
electrokinetic  field  from  one  dipole  acting  transversely  to  a  speeding  charge  at 
v/c=β in the other dipole, the magnitude of which is as k'β /r, as well as the purely 
magnetic Lorentz force k'(v1x r)x v2 /r 3. This manifestly requires our moving to two 
or  three  dimensions.  The  paradox  of  the  Lorentz  forces  apparently  violating 
Newton’s third law between particles in orthogonal motion or magnetic interaction 
was recently shown by Boyer to be resolved by the fact that the momentum-energy 
is conserved when taking into account the field’s energy ExH. For now, we stick to 
a  single  dimension  where  the  Coulomb  and  electrokinetic  forces  of  standard  and 
Weber’s electrodynamics coincide. Taking

precisely the Hamiltonian for two distinct harmonic oscillators with the frequencies

We now solve the problem of our coupled oscillators in the light of Planck’s and 
Post’s  ensemble  interpretation  of  the  zero-point  energy.  Planck’s  original  result 
involved counting the number of uncoupled harmonic oscillators that partake in the 
field’s motions in a disordered system averaged over some random phase φ  of the 
oscillators  at  a  given  frequency.  If  instead  of  phase-independent  non-interacting 
oscillators  we  have  a  system  of  coupled  oscillators  of  which  we  count  the 
individual  correlated  motions,  this  approach  yields  very  different  results  than  for 
the  uncoupled  case  studied  by  Planck.  This  point  has  also  been  stressed  by  Post. 
We assume that our oscillators can be diagonalized into two fundamental modes, of 
correlated or anticorrelated motions whose eigenfrequencies are ω−  and ω+ , that a 
vast majority of the oscillators are phase-correlated and contribute to the ω− mode, 
that  an  oscillator  whose  phase  shifts  from  φ    to  φ+π    increases  the  occupation 
number of one mode while decreasing that of the other, and that one such isolated 
transition  does  not  substantially  affect  the  two  fundamental  frequencies  of  the 
system.

The correlation tends to be transitive, even considering retardation. The correlated 
modes  can  form  coherent  stationary  or  propagating  states  in  large  ensembles 
whereas the anticorrelation tends to self-destruct, the anticorrelated modes tending 
to mutually exclude one another. So it is natural that the anticorrelating zero-modes 

should  resemble  those  of  a  fermionic  oscillator  and  have  the  corresponding 
statistics. Considering [10], the mean energy can be approximated

Note  the  remarkable  appearance  of  the  1/r  attractive  potential  in  the  zero  modes. 
The standard 1/r  6 attractive Van der Waals potential is now at the third order and 
has a few companions. In the ω- state, synchronously-accelerating electric dipoles 
mutually  increase  their  oscillation  and  dynamic  coupling,  thereby  decreasing  the 
energy available to the system by their interaction in proportion to 1/r , while the n+ 
anticorrelated dipoles have a higher potential energy and are repulsive. At a given 
temperature T,

Because  of  the  zero  modes  in  the  ensemble,  the  well-known  1/r  gravitational 
potential  never  vanishes.  We  find  that  the  ratio  of  the  excited  correlated  over  the 
anticorrelated modes creates an antigravitational effect with increasing temperature, 
the thermal random motions tending to destroy the correlated order. Note that each 
interacting mode extends about the oscillator only in some finite near-field volume 
that shrinks as the cube of the frequency, so that we are not faced with the prospect 
of  integrating  the  ZPE  of  empty  space,  except  in  the  far  infrared  from  distant 
matter.  Two  three-dimensional  coupled  oscillators  can  interchange  their  modes 
within  an  SU(3)  interacting  symmetry,  provided  that  their  electrodynamic 
interaction allows it. Gravity is the tendency of the excited states to adopt minimal 
energy configurations by correlating their motions with those of distant or nearby 
matter.  The  negative  temperatures  of  population  inversion  n+  >  n-  correspond  to 
antigravity, but can only involve selected modes that correlate within some object 
relative  to  certain  interacting  modes  of  another.  In  the  case  of  a  single  moving 
charge  in  each  oscillator  orbiting  a  substantially  heavier  one,  U12    ,  the  dynamics 
would keep the same form. The coupling between two dipoles mainly takes place 
in the near field, when ν± < c/r12. This allows the exchanged photons to be virtual. 
The  standard  gravitational  potential  appears  because  the  zero-modes  provide 
oscillations at all the frequencies in matter with a constant probability Cp(ω ). Such 
a derivation of gravity from electromagnetism is well suited to A.O. Barut’s unified 
electromagnetic  model  of  matter,  to  Dyonic  schemes  and  may  even  be  applied  to 
the standard model with some stretch of the imagination. The local inertial reaction 
relative  to  the  past  light-cone  can  be  attributed  to  an  active  interaction  with  its 
passive  near  field  three  dimensional  potential,  which  can  be  likened  to  a  ‘ZPF 
aether’,  one’s  acceleration  having  the  effect  of  increasing  its  Davies-Unruh 
temperature,  as  correctly  pointed  out  by  H.  Puthoff,  while  the  reaction  from  the 
future  light-cone  to  an  unbalanced  two-body  system  involves  an  active  and 
transverse  gravitokinetic  emission  from  the  system’s  unbalanced  quadrupole.  All 
the effective interactions are retarded. The main difference with the standard ZPF 

approach is that the past light cone’s inertia-inducing fluctuations are dominated by 
the  near-field  very  low  frequencies  that  originate  in  the  distant  matter  of  the 
Universe. Another difference is that it is the dynamics of the various states within 
matter  itself,  including  that  of  its  zero-modes,  that  induces  the  1/r  attraction. 
Because  of  retardation,  all  the  modes  cannot  be  correlated  in  N-body  systems,  so 
that anomalies are expected, as observed by Majorana and Allais.  
  
To conclude, the standard procedure for deriving the Van der Waals forces, along 
with an electrokinetic coupling, provides the only presently known derivation of a 
1/r  attractive  potential between  coupled  dipoles,  or  oscillating  charges.  In  this 
framework,  gravitation  is  a  statistically  emergent  phenomenon  that  is  induced  by 
the  kinetic  motions  of  charges  and  their  coupling  to  those  of  distant  objects.  Its 
dependence  upon  a  phase  hints  at  ways  of  manipulating  both  gravity  and  inertia. 
The addition of the weaker magnetic coupling does not significantly change these 
results in the long range, except by altering the eigenfrequencies with perturbative 
terms.  The  strong  and  weak  equivalence  principles  remain  to  be  proven  in  this 
context, and would mean that all mass-energy fundamentally involves the motions 
of charges and dipoles, possibly in the strongly coupled, nonlinear regime of small 
scales, including in hadrons and propagating photons and neutrinos.

Abstract. The Q & A experiment, first proposed and started in 1994, provides a feasible way 
of  exploring  the  quantum  vacuum  through  the  detection  of  vacuum  birefringence  effect 
generated by QED loop diagram and the detection of the polarization rotation effect generated 
by  photon-interacting  (pseudo-)scalar  particles.  Three  main  parts  of  the  experiment  are:  (1) 
Optics  System  (including  associated  Electronic  System)  based  on  a  suspended  3.5-m  high 
finesse  Fabry-Perot  cavity,  (2)  Ellipsometry  using  ultra-high  extinction-ratio  polarizer  and 
analyzer, and (3) Magnetic Field Modulation System for generating the birefringence and the 
polarization  rotation  effect.  In  2002,  the  Q  &  A  experiment  achieved  the  Phase  I  sensitivity 
goal.  During  Phase  II,  we  set  (i)  to  improve  the  control  system  of  the  cavity  mirrors  for 
suppressing the relative  motion noise, (ii) to  enhance the birefringence signal by setting-up a 
60-cm  long  2.3  T  transverse  permanent  magnet  rotatable  to  10  rev/s.,  (iii)  to  reduce 
geometrical  noise  by  inserting  a  polarization-maintaining  optical  fiber  (PM  fiber)  as  a  mode 
cleaner, and (iv) to use ultra-high extinction-ratio (10-9) polarizer and analyzer for ellipsometry. 
Here  we  report  on  (iii)  &  (iv);  specifically,  we  present  the  properties  of  the  PM-fiber  mode-
cleaner,  the  transfer  function  of  its  suspension  system,  and  the  result  of  our  measurement  of 
high extinction-ratio polarizer and analyzer.

1.  Introduction 
Birefringence  of  vacuum  is  predicted  by  QED  (Quantum  Electrodynamics)  in  external  transverse 
electrical or magnetic field (E or B) [1-6]. For gaseous matter, this phenomenon is known as Cotton-
Mouton effect. The velocity of light (∝ 1/n) propagating through a transverse B field depends on B2 
and the orientation of polarization of light relative to B. For B = |B| = 2.3 T, the corresponding vacuum 
birefringence  would  be  ∆n  =  n||  −  n⊥  =  2.5  ×  10-23  according  to  QED.  Experimental  schemes  for 
detecting vacuum birefringence were proposed by Iacopini and Zavattini [5], and Ni, Tsubono, Mio, 
Narihara, Chen, King and Pan [6]. First experiment was done in 1993 by Cameron et al. [7] with good 
upper  bounds  on  vacuum  birefringence  and  polarization  rotation.  A  pseudo-scalar  interaction  with 
electromagnetism  (LI  ~ φFijFkleijkl)  was  proposed  which  was  empirically  allowed  in  the  study  of 
equivalence principles [8-10]; in terms of Feynman diagram, this interaction gives a 2-photon-pseudo-
scalar  vertex.  With  this  interaction,  vacuum  becomes  birefringent  and  dichroic  [11-13].  In  1994,  3 
experiments  were  put  forward  and  started  for  measuring  the  vacuum  birefringence:  the  PVLAS

by the suspended Fabry-Perot cavity. With a quarter-wave plate and additional modulation by the Faraday cell, the birefringence signal can 
be extracted as a polarization rotation signal through a lock-in amplifier with precisely detected signal phase for long-term integration when 
automatic alignment control loop is closed. (b) Design of the Q & A experiment with fiber-mode cleaner inserted. 
 
experiment [14], the Fermilab P-877 experiment [15], and the Q & A (QED & Axion) experiment [16]; 
these  experiment  were  reported  in  the  “Frontier  Test  of  QED  and  Physics  of  Vacuum”  Meeting  in 
1998.  Fermilab  P-877  experiment  was  terminated  in  2000.  This  year  in  the  QED-2005  (QED, 
Quantum  Vacuum  and  the  Search  for  New  Forces,  Les  Houches,  France,  June,  2005)  conference, 
again, 3 experiments were reported: the PVLAS experiment [17], the BMV experiment [18], and the Q 
& A experiment [19]. A compilation of basic characteristics of these 3 experiments were given in [20]. 
All 3 experiments use high-finesse Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) cavity to enhance the effect to be 
measured.  The  PVLAS  experiment  reported  a  positive  measurement  of  polarization  rotation  and 
suggested a possible interpretation of this result to the existence of a pseudoscalar particle coupled to 
photons [17, 21]. 

Our  experimental  scheme  is  shown  in  figure  1.  We  had  built  a  3.5  m  prototype  X-pendulum-
double-pendulum suspended FPI and achieved the Phase I sensitivity goal [22] in 2002. After 2002, 
we  are  working  on  improving  this  prototype  by  implementing  an  automatic  alignment  system  for 
suspension  control,  by  using  a  60  cm  2.3  T  rotatable  permanent  magnet  as  modulation  source  to 
enhance  signal,  and  by  employing  a  pair  of  high-extinction-ratio  polarizer  and  analyzer  for 
ellipticity/polarization rotation detection (figure 1(a)). We plan to insert a double-pendulum suspended

control mechanism into the current automatic alignment system (figure 1(b)). 

2.  Fiber mode cleaner and its suspension system 
Optical fiber as mode cleaner has been adopted in the experiment as mentioned in [23] and helps to 
filter out some higher order transverse modes from the injection beam. The fundamental mode emitted 
from a single mode PM fiber is regarded as a good  approximation of the FPI’s fundamental TEM00 
mode. For further reduction of seismic noise in our detection band (10-20 Hz), it is obvious that we 
need a suspension solution for the fiber output coupler. Both the suspension of the fiber output coupler 
and the FPI will be automatically aligned to reduce the geometrical noise caused by relative motion. 

In figure 2(a), a double pendulum suspension system is introduced and monitored by an HP 3-axis 
heterodyne interferometer with respect to the coordinate system shown. The fiber table (figure 2(b)) is 
designed to support the fiber output coupler, the polarizer, and some necessary optics for retrieving the 
Pound-Drever-Hall locking signal as shown in figure 1(b). A recoil mass with weight equal to the fiber 
table is suspended from the same upper stage to hold 4 coils (C1, C2, CA, CB) of the magnet-coil pair 
actuators  and  reduce  the  recoil  perturbation.  Here  we  show  the  measurements  of  translational  and 
rotational noise spectrum densities of the stage (figure 2(c)), and the open loop transfer function (TF) 
of displacement in 3 degrees of freedom versus the applied current (transformed into voltage signal) in 
the coils (figure 3). The TFs for each individual coil were measured with the presence of the passive 
damper, which seemed to attenuate the main resonances by 10-20 dB (figure 2(c)). The input current 
signal  is  a  periodic  linear  frequency-sweep  (0.1-10  Hz)  with  a  sweep  time  of  40  seconds,  and  the 
output displacement of the stage is recorded by the HP interferometer with a sampling rate of 85 Hz 
(PCI-GPIB  interface). The  TFs  were  then  off-line  analyzed.  For  X  and  Z,  the  TFs  are  simplified  to 
simple pendulum formula due to weight matching of the stage and the recoil mass. However, weight 
matching does not imply or guarantee momentum-of-inertia matching; the TF for yaw still looks like a

in translational degrees are of the form of simple pendulums due to -weight matching; in rotational degree of freedom it is of the 
form of double pendulum due to non-matching of momentum-of-inertia of the recoil mass. 

 
double  pendulum.  Further  test  will  proceed  after  completing  the  control  servo  design  from  the 
measured open loop TFs. 

3.  Extinction ratio of the ellipsometer 
For precise determination of the birefringence (the ellipticity) noise floor, it is necessary to understand 
the detection limit of the ellipsometer. The ellipsometer can be simply characterized by the extinction 
ratio (σ2) of the analyzer from the famous Malus Equation: 
 

I = I0 (σ 2 + sin2α) ≈ I0 (σ 2 + α 2) 

 
where  I0  and  I  are  the  measured  intensity  of  light  before  and  after  it  passes  through  a  pair  of 
orthogonal-oriented  polarizer  and  analyzer,  and  α  is  the  misaligned  angle  between  the  crossed 
polarizer  and  analyzer.  To  experimentally  determine  σ  2,  we  focus  in  the  region  where  α  is  most 
sensitive to σ 2 to obtain a good fitting. This demands α 2 to be comparable to σ 2 and the measurement 
range  of α  be  larger  than  2σ.  For σ  2  ~  10-9,  we  use  a  measurement  range  larger  than  10-4  rad  and 
angular resolution less than 10-6 rad. We use an HP 3-axis heterodyne interferometer to measure the 
distance and angle. For rotating the analyzer, we employ a combination of piezo transducer (PZT) and 
flexure structure as in [24]. The resolution of heterodyne interferometry for length metrology [25] can 
be readily converted into the resolution of angle measurement. The angular resolution is 3.5 × 10-7 rad. 
The experimental set up is shown in figure 4: A well collimated Nd-YAG laser beam is intensity-
modulated  by  a  chopper  before  passing  through  a  pair  of  crossed  polarizer  and  analyzer.  A  photo-
detector  lock-in  detects  the  transmitted  laser  power  with  the  chopper  signal  while  the  heterodyne 
interferometer detects the angular position change induced by a voltage-driven PZT. The result of a 
typical measurement is shown in figure 5(a). Each data point in the figure is the average of 100 times 
data-taking  both  in  angle  and  in  intensity.  The  standard  deviation  of  the  intensity  measurement  is

represented by an error bar; the standard deviation of the angle measurement is not shown for clarity 
of drawing. We estimate the extinction ratio of the analyzer by first recording these average values and 
error  bars  of  independent  angular  sweeps.  Then  for  each  independent  sweep,  we  use  Monte-Carlo 
method to generate 10,000 samples consistent with average values and error bars and least-square-fit 
these  samples  to  obtain  a  distribution  of  parabolic  parameters.  From  this  distribution,  the  extinction 
ratio  σ  2  and  its  standard  deviation  are  determined.  For  3  different  analyzers  with  identification 
numbers  3,  4,  and  5,  the  experimental  extinction  ratio  and  error  bar  for  all  independent  sweeps  are 
shown in figure  5(b). The extinction  ratios  were in the  order  of  10-9 to 10-10. The  highest extinction 
value measured was (5.21 ± 0.41) × 10-10, which we believe to be the highest value so far that has ever 
been  reported  at  1064  nm  wavelength.  For  633  nm  wavelength,  Takubo  et  al.  has  measured  an 
extinction value of (2.9 ± 0.2) × 10-10 [24]. 

4.  Discussion and outlook 
From the Malus equation, it is quite obvious that higher extinction ratio would give better resolution/ 
sensitivity in ellipticity/polarization rotation detection. The ellipticity sensitivity for the current Q & A 
experiment at 20 Hz is 2 × 10-6 rad⋅Hz-1/2. With all the profits we can gain from the suppression of the 
geometric noise and the high extinction ratio ellipsometry, it’s quite conceivable for us to reach our 
Phase II sensitivity goal of 5 × 10-8 rad⋅Hz-1/2 at 10 - 20 Hz signal band. Before that, we can perform a 
high-resolution determination of gaseous birefringent Cotton-Mouton coefficient for various kinds of 
gases such as N2, O2, H2, CO2 or He at 1064 nm wavelength which has not been measured yet [26-27]. 
We are also looking forward to performing a measurement of polarization rotation to compare with 

the PVLAS result [17, 21] after the improvement in this paper and in the companion paper [28].

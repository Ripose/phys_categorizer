ABSTRACT 

 
The purpose of this study is the evaluation of the variation of performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity of two 
radiologists with different experience in mammography, with and without the assistance of two different CAD systems. 
The CAD considered are SecondLookTM  (CADx  Medical  Systems,  Canada),  and  CALMA  (Computer  Assisted  Library 
in MAmmography). The first is a commercial system, the other is the result of a a research project, supported by INFN 
(Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Italy); their characteristics  have  been  already  reported  in  literature.  To  compare 
the results with and without these tools, a dataset composed by 70 images of patients with cancer (biopsy proven) and 
120 images of healthy breasts (with a three years follow up) has been collected. All the images have been digitized and 
analysed  by  two  CAD,  then  two  radiologists  with  respectively  6  and  2  years  of  experience  in  mammography 
indipendently made their diagnosis without and with, the support of the two CAD systems. In this work sensitivity  and 
specificity variation, the Az area under the ROC curve, are reported. The results show that the use of a CAD allows for a 
substantial increment in sensitivity and a less pronounced decrement in specificity. The extent of these effects depends 
on the experience of the readers and is comparable for the two CAD considered.  

Keywords: Computer-Aided Detection, mammography, double reading, breast cancer. 
 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

 
In this study two CAD systems have been used as second reader. The advantages and disvantage that their use produced 
on the radiologist’s work are reported. 
It was demonstrated that the use of computerized detection in mammography produced an increment in sensitivity, both 
for  masses  and  for  microcalcification  clusters  research  [1,2,3,4,5].  In  medical  physics  literature  the  increasing  of 
sensitivity  in  finding  spiculated  lesions  ranges  from  3%  to  14%.  The  automatic  classification  of  microcalcifications  by 
neural  networks  shows  a  good  performance  to  distinguish  benign  from  malignant  clusters  [6]. Computerized systems 
are able to find the signs of cancer lost by a human double reading [7]. 
In literature few studies have compared two different CAD systems using the same data-set of images [8].  
In this work the evaluation of sensitivity and specificity, in the detection of microcalcification clusters, of 2 radiologists 
with  and  without  the  help  of  two  different  CAD  systems  is  reported.  The  performances  of  the  two  CAD  systems 
working alone have been already evaluated in previous works [9,10].  
As well a qualitative study on the new way to make a medical report with the aid of computer is realized as well. The 
readers viewed the image on different supports: first the original image has been viewed on film, then the same image, 
with  the  area  suggested  from  the  CAD  system,  was  visualized  on  paper  (SecondLook)  or  on  monitor  (CALMA).  We

investigated how the double reading with the CAD influences radiologists in their work-flow,  in  terms  of  time  and  loss 
of concentrantion. 
 

2. CAD SYSTEMS 

2.1 SecondLookTM CAD 

 
The  first  CAD  system  considered  was  the  SecondLookTM  (CADx,  Medical  Systems)  produced  in  Canada.  It  runs  in 
three  steps.  First  it  digitilizes  mammograms,  then  a  neural  network  analizes  them  to  produce,  as  last  step,  a  printed 
output  (called  Mammagraph)  where  the  regions  of  interest  are  pointed  out  by  markers.  An  oval  pointer  indicates  a 
massive lesion, while a rectangular one points out a cluster of microcalcification. Time to obtain the print out is about 6 
minutes. It was not possible to modify, to  visualize or to store images. The print out is not useful to realize a diagnosis 
because the low quality [11]. The SecondLook printout is shown in figure 1.  
Preliminary results about its perfomances have been published elsewhere [12].

2.2 CALMA CAD  

 

 
The other CAD system used is CALMA (Computer Assisted Library in MAmmography), developed by INFN (Istituto 
Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare), some universities and many Italian hospitals. As a first step the mammogram is digitized 
by a CCD linear scanner (85 ? m, 12 bit/pixel), and it is stored in a CALMA specific format. In the following step, the 
radiologist  visualizes  it  on  the  screen  with  help  of  some  visualization  tools  (i.d.  zoom,  contrast  enhancement). 
Microcalcification  icon  starts  the  program  automatic  search.  This  program  contains  both  algorithms  and  neural 
networks.  In  few  seconds  a  red  rectangle  points  out  regions  of  interest  (ROI)  where  suspicious  microcalcification 
clusters  are  recognized  by  the  system  (Figure  2).  Software and hardware characteristics of the CALMA system can be 
found in literature [13,14,15].

The dataset used is composed by 70 images of malignant histopathological patients (biopsy proven) and 120 images of 
healthy cases (proven by three years radiological follow up). The images were collected from different mammographic 
centers,  from  screening  and  clinical  tests.  In  the  detected  images  different  kind  of  microcalcification  clusters  are 
present.  Among  them  there  were  24  cases  of  ductal  infiltranting  carcinoma,  6  cases  of  ductal  in  situ  carcinoma  and  2 
cases of tubular infiltranting carcinoma, in the the other cases the kind of carcinoma was not specified. Each cluster had 
a diameter ranging from 3 mm to 4 cm.  
All  the  images  weredigitized  and  analysed  by  the  two  CAD  systems,  then  two  radiologists  with  respectively  6  and  2 
years of experience in mammography in a public hospital viewed the films in a conventional way at the diaphanoscope. 
Each  radiologist  viewed  all  the  images  in  a  random  order,  every  time  he  was  blind  to  the  final  diagnosis  and 
independent  from  the  other  one.  After  two  months  the  radiologists  viewed  the  same  films  with  the    SecondLook 
printout;  10  months  later  they  examined  the digitized images on a high resolution screen, observing the ROI suggested 
by CALMA CAD. The medical report was compared to the final diagnosis. The goal consisted of the detection of the 
right area where the lesion was biopsy proven. 
Time  to  take  decision  and  remarks  of  radiologists  concerning  the  new  procedures  are  reported.  All  the  sessions  were 
repeated  in  the  same  physical  conditions  of  light,  time  and  no hurry. The doctors were previously informed about how 
the systems work. 
Different parameters were considered to evaluate the sigificativity of the results from a diagnostic and statistic point of 
view.  For  each  radiologist  sensitivity  and  specificity  were  estimated:  a)  alone,  b)  with  CADx,  c)  with  CALMA, 
according to the following relations: 
Sensitivity = number of images properly classified as positive (TP) / total number of positive images (TP+FN); 
Specificity = number of images properly classified as negative (TN) / total number of negative images (TN+FP). 
TP (true positive) or TN (true negative) are obtained when the medical report is in accord with the final diagnosis, while 
FP  (false  positive)  or  FN  (false  negative)  indicate  that  the  human  diagnosis  doesn’t  match  with  the  gold  standard. 
Sensistivity  and  specificity  are  not  sufficient  to  describe  the  efficacy  of  a  CAD  system  [16].  Another  parameter  is   
commonly  considered:  the  area  Az  under  the  ROC  curve.  The  ROC  curve  is  the  most  complete  way  to  describe  the 
diagnostic  capability  of  a  system,  it  represents  the  capability  to  distinguish  positive  fr om  negative  cases.  The  yes/no 
method [17] was employed to calculate it. Sensitivity, specificity and ROC analysis were evaluated using the bootstrap 
method,  that  estimates  the  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  in  the  statistical  analisys.  Matlab  software  was  used  to 
perform this calculation. Using chi-square test,  p values were evaluated. The area A z under the ROC curve and p values 
were calculated using MedCalc?  software.  
 

4. RESULTS 

 
Radiologist  A  detected  58  (58/70)  images  of  cancer  cases  and  110  (110/120)   images  of  healty  cases;  radiologist  B 
detected 50 (50/70) images of cancer cases and 89 (89/120) images of healty cases.  
Using the CADx system as second reader radiologist A detected 66 (66/70) images of cancer cases and 101 (101/120) 
images  of  healty  cases;  radiologist  B  detected  58  (58/60)  images  of  cancer  cases  and  85  (85/120)  images  of  healty 
cases. 
Using the CALMA system as second reader radiologist A detected 66 (66/70) images of cancer cases and 106 (106/120) 
images  of  healty  cases;  radiologist  B  detected  61  (61/70)  images  of  cancer  cases  and  85  (85/120)  images  of  healty 
cases.  
Sensitivity and specificity, in percentage, are respectively reported in table 1 and in table 2. These values are estimated 
to 95% confidence interval (C.I.).  
Using  chi-square test p values are evaluated; they always result less than 0.0001, only in one case (reader A alone)  p  is 
equal to 0.0005.

5. CONCLUSION 

 
The average value of sensitivity for a radiologist alone is 78.1%  ? 5.9%, the average value of sensitivity with the aid of 
SecondLook  and  CALMA  CAD  is  respectively  88.5%  ? 5.7%  and  90.5%? 3.6%.  These  values,  are  in  accord  with 
previous works [4, 5, 6, 7], where an increment in sensitivity is shown when a CAD system is used as second reader. In 
addition the standard deviation decreases by a small amount. In a recent studiy Jiang and et al. [18] reported the value of 
sensitivity  of  74%  ?  11% of radiologists working alone; using the R2 technology CAD system, the value improved by 
13% becoming 87%  ? 9%. These results are in line with ours where the average improvement in sensitivity for CADx 
and for CALMA is respectively 10.4% and 12.4%. Taft et al. [10] also reported an increment in sensitivity with the aid 
of  CADx  ranging  from  8%  to  10.5%.  It  is  interesting  to  notice  that  the  average  decrease  in  specificity  of  the  present 
study  is  4.2%  for  CADX  and  2.2%  for  CALMA.  The  area  Az  under  the  ROC  curve  increased  in  both  studies  but  the 
improvements evaluated in the present work are not statistically significant. 
The results reported here are also in accord with studies performed by  Ciatto and colleagu es  [19],  and  by  Malich  and 
colleagues [12]. 
The  diagnosis  method  of   the  radiologists  involved  evolved  in  the  course  of  this  study.  The  reading  time,  at  the 
beginning,  using  either  of  the  CAD  systems  was  twice  as  long,  but  during  the  study  the  radiologists  learned  to 
synchronize the double reading.  
In conclusion, previous studies have shown that the double reading produces an increment in terms of sensitivity of up 
to 15% [2, 3]. In our study, not conditioned by the dataset, we show that the CAD system as a second reader detemined 
an increase in overall sensitivity of up to 15.6%, with a slight increase of the number of false positives. The decrease in 
specificity  was  more  significant  for  the  least  experienced  of  the  radiologists.  Az  area  increased  both  with  CADx  and 
CALMA,  the  variation  ranges  from  0.01  to  0.06,  independently  of  the  skill  of  reader. The  results  obtained  show    that 
CAD  systems  could  be  advantegeously  used  in  clinical  practice  specially  when  the  human  double  reading  is  not 
feasible.

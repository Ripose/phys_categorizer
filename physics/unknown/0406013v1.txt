I describe a new scheme for selectively isolating high density low longitudinal emittance 

beam particles in a storage ring from the rest of the beam without emittance dilution.  I 

discuss the general principle of the method, called longitudinal momentum mining, multi-

particle  beam  dynamics  simulations  and  results  of  beam  experiments.  Multi-particle 

beam  dynamics  simulations  applied  to  the  Fermilab  8  GeV  Recycler  (a  storage  ring) 

convincingly  validate  the  concepts  and  feasibility  of  the  method,  which  I  have 

demonstrated with beam experiments in the Recycler. The method presented here is the 

first of its kind.

One  of  the  most  important  problems  encountered  in  high-energy  hadron  beam 

storage rings is to select only the high intensity, low emittance, region of the phase space 

of beam particles with minimal emittance dilution.  Considerable progress has been made 
over  the  last  fifty  years1  2    on  techniques  broadly  referred  to  as  momentum  mining, 

namely, the selective isolation of the beam particles in the high density, low longitudinal 

emittance region from the rest of the phase space. Typically, the region of interest in the 
beam  particle  distribution  lies  in  the  vicinity  of  the  synchronous  particle3.  Antiproton 
storage  rings  both  at  CERN4  and  at  Fermilab5  have  adopted  what  I  call  transverse 

momentum mining for extracting the dense beam from a stack of cooled beam particles. 

For example, in the antiproton Accumulator Ring at Fermilab, a part of the stored beam is 

captured  adiabatically  in  buckets  of  sinusoidal  radio-frequency  (rf)  waves  with  h 

(harmonic  number)=4  and  bucket  area  smaller  than  the  total  beam  phase  space  area. 

Subsequently,  the  beam  particles  in  h=4  buckets  are  pulled  out  from  the  main  stack 

transversely  through  acceleration.  Once  they  are  completely  outside  of  the  main  stack, 

they  are  extracted.  The  shortcoming  of  this  method  is  the  inevitable  beam  disruption 

caused  by  the  separation  of  the  low  emittance  particles  from  the  beam.    Consequently, 

this  leads  to  longitudinal  emittance  growth  and,  if  the  beam  extraction  is  carried  out 

multiple times, the later extractions suffer from lower particle density.  

 

Previously,  a  method  for  proton  mining  using  dual  frequency  amplitude 
modulation has been proposed,6 7 which is very similar to the transverse mining method. 

 
In this paper, I propose a new technique for mining8 beam particles from the high 

density  region  of  the  longitudinal  phase  space  with  minimal  emittance  dilution.  The 
mining is done using a rectangular barrier9 rf system.   

A particle beam in a storage ring is characterized by its energy spread 

 about 

^

ED

its  synchronous  energy  E0  and  a  characteristic  transverse  emittance.  In  the  absence  of 

synchro-betatron  coupling  these  two  quantities  can  be  varied  independently  of  each 

other.  Generally,  the  energy  distribution  of  the  particles  in  the  storage  ring  is 

approximately parabolic or Gaussian in shape with the synchronous particles at the peak 

and  the  particles  of  lower  energy  spread  closer  to  the  peak  than  those  with  a  greater 
spread.    The  Hamiltonian  of  any  particle  with  energy ED

relative  to  the  synchronous 

particle in a synchrotron is given by,10 11

The  objective  of  longitudinal  momentum  mining  is  to  isolate  particles  closer  to 

0E  from the rest. This is accomplished by adiabatically inserting a mining bucket inside 

the existing well (between 

2/2T-

 and 

2/2T

), as indicated by arrows in Fig.  1(b), so that 

all  particles  with  energy  near  the  synchronous  energy,  including  synchronous  particles, 

drift  to  the  lowest  potential.    It  is  important  to  note  that  the  trapping  of  particles  take 

place during the adiabatic opening of the mining bucket. Since the synchrotron oscillation 

periods of the particles with energy closest to 

0E  are very large, the drift times are very 

long.    To  expedite  the  mining  process  and  to  ensure  the  trapping  of  particles  with 

energy 0E ,  one  can  grow  a  negative  pulse  immediately  to  the  right  of  the  left-most  rf 

pulse (at

2/2T-

) and shovel adiabatically to a location to the right indicated by 

aT .   The

We  have  applied  the  scheme  described  above  to  the  beam  in  the  Fermilab 
Recycler12.  The Recycler  is an 8 GeV synchrotron storage ring that operates below the 
0T  = 11.12 m sec. This will be the main antiproton 

transition energy (

 = 21.6) and has

stacked  and  stored  azimuthally  in  the  Recycler  using  barrier  buckets  generated  by  a 
broad-band  rf  system13  capable  of  providing  rf  pulses  of  2  kV.  The  beam  is  cooled 
initially  using  stochastic  cooling14  and  is  expected  to  be  cooled  further  with  electron 
  7  p -mm-mr  transversely.    We  plan  to 
cooling15  to  £

  54  eVs  longitudinally  and  £

accumulate  >  6· 1012  antiprotons  in  the  Recycler  before  they  are  transferred  to  the 

5
Tevatron

.  Either a part of the cooled beam or the entire stack will be extracted in nine 

transfers  of  equal  emittance  and  equal  intensities,  each  with  four  2.5  MHz  bunches.  

Thus, there will be thirty six antiproton bunches in the Tevatron from the Recycler.  The 
longitudinal  emittance  of  each  bunch  at  the  time  of  extraction  is  expected  £ 1.5  eVs. 

Stacking and un-stacking of antiprotons from the Recycler entails complicated sets of rf 
manipulations16.  In order to achieve high proton-antiproton luminosity in the Tevatron, it 

is  essential  to  maintain  the  emittance  of  the  beam  throughout  the  chain  of  rf 

manipulations in the Recycler and to send only a high density low longitudinal emittance 

beam to the Tevatron.     

 

 

Our testing of the method of longitudinal momentum mining in the Recycler was 

carried  out  in  two  steps.  First,  computer  simulations  using  a  multi-particle  beam 
dynamics  code,  ESME17,  were  carried  out  to  establish  the  mining  steps.    Then, 

experiments were done with beam in the Recycler to demonstrate the technique.   

The  simulation  results  presented  here  assume  about  100  eVs  of  beam  in  the 

Recycler captured in a rectangular barrier bucket. The primary goal was to mine 54 eVs 

of the low longitudinal emittance high density part of the phase space distribution of the 

beam and capture the rest of the beam in a separate bucket.

low longitudinal emittance particles to the right hand side using -0.33 kV  rf pulse.  The 
arrows indicate the final locations of the rf pulses used. In the simulation, the right side 
mining rf pulse (+0.33 kV  in  height) was at a  fixed position  while the  left rf pulse was 
cogged  iso-adiabatically  from  left  to  right  during  shoveling  in  about  15  sec.  (c)  After 
longitudinal  momentum  mining;  the  left  bunch  (indicated  by  an  arrow)  comprises  of 
particles  with  high  momentum  spread  (bunch  area  » 51  eVs)  and  the  low  longitudinal 
emittance particles are captured in the right-side bucket (bunch area = 54 eVs).   

 

 

Fig.  2 shows the beam particle distribution in (

)-phase space for different 

t,ED

stages of  mining. The  beam distributions  before  and during  mining are  shown  in  Fig.  s 
2(a) (energy spread of – 5.7 MeV) and 2(b), respectively. The width and amplitude of the 

barrier pulses used were, respectively, 0.9 m sec and 2 kV for the initial distribution (Fig.  

2(a)).  Fig.  2(b) shows the distribution after populating all of the low emittance particles 

to the right hand side in a mining bucket (indicated between two arrows). The size of the 
mining bucket was chosen to be 54 eVs with 0.33 kV amplitude and 0.34 m sec width. All 

particles with energy spread less than the bucket-height of the mining bucket are confined 

to the right hand side while the rest  move  freely  throughout the original  bucket. (These 

two cases correspond to the schematic picture shown in Fig. s 1A and 1B). 

The  isolation  of  54  eVs  low  emittance  high  density  beam  was  accomplished  by 
opening a bucket (indicated by an arrow in Fig.  2(c)) of an area ‡ 46 eVs; the area and 

height  of  this  bucket  was  chosen  to  be  74  eVs  and  – 21.7  MeV,  respectively.    The  Fig.  

2(c) shows the final phase space distribution after completion of mining. The total phase-

space  area  was  found  to  be  preserved  to  better  than  10%  at  the  end  of  all  rf 

manipulations. All of the emittance growth was seen in the 74 eVs bucket and occurred 

during the opening of this bucket.  

Finally,  the  54  eVs  beam  was  divided  into  nine  bunches  of  equal  intensity  and 

equal longitudinal emittance simply by adiabatic capture (e.g., see Fig.  3(b)) and, each of 

the nine bunches were further divided into four 2.5MHz bunches each with 1.5 eVs and 

were prepared for collider operation.   

The  simulation  clearly  showed  that  the  amount  of  beam  mined  was  a  strong 

function of the energy distribution of particles.  For a parabolic distribution, 74% of the 

beam was mined whereas for Gaussian distribution 64% was mined.  

 The beam tests were carried out using protons in the Recycler.  About 170· 1010   

protons  of  longitudinal  emittance  110– 15  eVs  (95%  emittance)  and  energy  spread  of 

 

 

 

 

– (14.3– 0.6)  MeV  were  stored  in  a  3.7  m sec  wide  rectangular  barrier  bucket  of  – 2  kV 

pulse height. The beam was stretched slowly to 8.7 m sec and the momentum mining was 

performed  essentially  following  the  sequence  studied  in  the  simulation.  Experimentally, 

the  entire  mining  process  took  about  135  sec  while  the  simulation  suggested  about  110 

sec.

emittance particles in the nine buckets and the rest in the left most bucket.   

 

 

 

The wall current monitor data taken after the formation of nine bunches are shown 

in Fig.  3(a).  The average longitudinal emittance of the beam in these nine buckets is 5.6 
eVs –

 0.6 eVs (95% emittance) and the bunch on far left with particles of high momentum 

spread has longitudinal emittance of 55.5 eVs –

 12.5 eVs (95% emittance).  Fig.  3(b) is 

the corresponding  simulated distribution. Experimentally,  we  find that about 65% of the 

beam particles are mined in the nine smaller buckets to be compared with 74% predicted 

by  our  simulation.    The  difference  is  due  primarily  to  the  assumed  ideal  parabolic 

distribution  for  the  initial  energy  spectrum,  while  the  un-cooled  beam  used  for  the 

experiments  did  not  resemble  a  parabolic  energy  distribution.      We  also  see  some 

qualitative difference between the shapes of the measured wall current monitor data (Fig.  

3(a)) and the predictions (Fig. 3(b)). This difference is mainly attributed to (a) the initial 

energy distribution and (b) the details of rf pulse shapes used  in the experiment and the 

one in the simulation (which was rectangular in shape). 

 

 

 

 

In  summary,  I  have  proposed  and  validated  a  novel  method  for  selectively 

isolating  low  longitudinal  emittance  particles  and  extracting  of  beam  bunches  from  a 

storage ring using rf barrier buckets.  I have studied the scheme using multi-particle beam 

dynamics simulations and the technique has been demonstrated with beam experiments in 

the  Recycler  using  protons.  This  method  of  momentum  mining  has  been  successfully 

implemented and used routinely for beam extraction from the Fermilab Recycler. 

As  a  final  note,  I  expect that the  applications  of  the  technique  described  here  to 

selectively isolate the high density region of the phase space may not be unique to high-

energy storage rings; it should have broad application in other low energy circular storage 

rings that use barrier rf systems.

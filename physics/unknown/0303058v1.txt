In this work we present an attractive least-squares fitting procedure to obtain a quartic

force field by using energy, gradient and  Hessian data arising from electronic  wave function

calculations on a suitably chosen grid of points. We use the experimental design to select the

grid  points  :  a  “simplex-sum”  of  Box  and  Behnken  grid  is  used  for  its  efficiency  and

accuracy.  We  illustrate  the  numerical  implementation  of  the  method  by  using  energy  and

gradient  data  and  we  test  for  H2O  and  H2CO  the  B3LYP/cc-pVTZ  quartic  force  field

performed from 11 and 44 simplex-sum configurations. Results compared to classical 44 and

168 energy calculations, show excellent agreement.

INTRODUCTION

Calculation of molecular vibrations requires the construction of a potentiel function which can

be written as a Taylor expansion in terms of curvilinear displacement coordinates :

Quadratic, cubic and quartic force constants  are generally  obtained  by  fitting data stemming

from ab-initio calculations of the electronic energy for several nuclear configurations, or by a

finite difference procedure of first or second derivatives of electronic energy with respect to

the nuclear  coordinates.  Whatever  the  manner  of  proceeding,  one  to  accumulates  a  great

number  of  data  resulting  from  ab-initio  calculations  carried  out  in  a  grid  of  points

representing the geometrical variations and deduces from it the analytical potential function.

The  number  of  force  constants  increases  quickly  with  the  size  of  the  molecule,  leading  to

problems  of  data  acquisition  and  precision  on  the  polynomial  expansion  coefficients  to  be

determined for systems over four atoms.

Attempts to overcome this difficulty in the literature aim at obtaining  quartic  force fields  by

using  energy,  gradient  and  Hessian  data  arising 

from  electronic  wave 

function

calculations1,2,3,4, raising the question of the most efficient and accurate point distribution for

the determination of polynomial parameters. These requirements are often neglected in papers

relating to this problem, so we particularly lay emphasis on this aspect here.

In  this  work  we  present  the  procedure  implemented  in  our  code  REGRESS  EGH5,  for

determining  the  analytical  form  of    the  potential  with  a  reduced  number  of  points  to  be

calculated  without  deteriorating  the  accuracy  of  the  results.  These  procedures  include  the

“extended  least  squares  fitting”,  which  consists  jointly  in  fitting  all  the  data  from  an

observable  and  its  analytical  n-derivatives,  and  an  “a  posteriori  error  estimation”  on  each

anharmonic force constant to control the accuracy of the least-squares fitting methods. In  the

framework  of  the  (E-G)  method  consisting  of  fitting  both  ab  initio  electronic  energies  and

gradients,  we  have  used  the  experimental  design  approach  in  order  to  select  two  point

distributions well suited for the construction of a complete  quartic force  field. In application

to H2O and H2CO we compare the reduction of computational cost and variance obtained on

each force constant with results from the standard least squares method.

The  best  set  of  kK  parameters  is  found  by  minimizing  the  following  merit  function  (E

In  this  formalism,  all  available  analytical  data  can  jointly  be  used  for  obtaining  all  the

polynomial coefficients. Thus, equation (10) ensures the best computational efficiency as well

as the smoothing of numerical errors in comparison with finite difference formulas.

EXAMPLE OF THE (E-G) method

In this case, the expression of the residue is truncated to first order derivatives: R=RE+RG

A.  Choice of the grid system

The grid system must fulfil three criteria:

It must generate a non-singular [ ]

 matrix.

-  

-  

-  

It  must  be  efficient,  i.e.  contain  the  minimum  possible  number  of  points  for  the

determination of all parameters.

It  must  provide  sufficient  accuracy  for  calculating  coefficients,  i.e.  place  the

parameters within a confidence interval having little effect on the value of  anharmonic

vibrational frequencies.

This problem is far from being trivial and can be solved on the basis of work by  Sana 8, who

proposed  several  grids  to  determine  a  quadratic  and  cubic  force  field  using  a  least  square

fitting of gradient data from the theory of experimental design. In this approach, an n-1 degree

experimental plan is used to determine a complete n order force field. The simplex planes  9

thus  lead  to  the  determination  of  a  harmonic  force  field  with  k+2  gradients  for  a  non-

symmetrical molecule with k variables. The composite planes10 lead to the determination of a

cubic  force  field  with  1+2k+2k-p  gradients  for  k  variables  with  p  chosen  to  minimize  the

number of calculations 8.

Using the above procedure, a complete fourth order potential function can be determined with

the (E-G) method by using a third degree design11. Two  inexpensive grids were  selected, the

simplex-sum planes of Box and Behnken12 truncated at the third sum and a  Koshal13 plan. The

construction of these two planes is described in an appendix.

B.  Gain in the number of calculations

Table  1  shows  savings  in  terms  of  calculation  points  of  an  (E-G)  method  for  the  two  grids

selected,  in  comparison  to  a  standard  least-square  fitting  procedure.  Experience  has  shown

that it is generally prudent to calculate at least twice as many points as coefficients when the

usual linear regression method (E) is used, in order to smooth numerical errors. The use of the

(E-G)  method  results  in  significant  gains  that  increase  with  the  size  of  the  system  studied,

since the number of calculations is divided by a factor of about 5 for a triatomic molecule and

close  to  16  for  a  molecule  containing  10  atoms.  In  addition,  the  redundancy  of  information

with  the  (E-G)  method  also  increases  with  the  complexity  of  the  problem,  regardless  of  the

plan used. If we compare the truncated simplex-sum design with the  Koshal plan,  it will  be

seen that the latter should in all cases be the most effective. Nevertheless it must be noted that

molecular symmetry is not taken into account in this illustration.

C.  Gain in time

The computational cost of the analytical gradient is added to that for energy at each calculated

point of the potential grid. Table 2 shows this increase with respect to the number of variables

and  to  the  ab  initio  method  used.  In  this  illustration,  calculations  were  carried  out  at

equilibrium  geometry  with  the  Gaussian  98  code14.  For  the  HF/6-311G*,  B3LYP/6-311G*

and MP2/6-311G* methods, the mean increase in calculation times per point are 42 %, 29 %

and  82  %,  respectively  It  is  thus  low  and  constant,  regardless  of  the  complexity  of  the

problem.

In fig. 1, the computational costs of the H2CnO series at equilibrium geometry with the

B3LYP/6-311G*  method  were  multiplied  by  the  number  of  points  required  to  determine  a

quartic  force  field  with  the  different  linear  regression  methods.  Thus,  in  spite  of  time

limitations due to calculation of the gradient, the gain is satisfying since it rises by between a

factor of 4 and 13 in the series shown and illustrates the degree of effectiveness of the (E-G)

method. The accuracy of these grids is shown in the following examples.

IV.  CALCULATIONS OF QUARTIC FORCE FIELD WITH THE (E-G) METHOD

Using the examples of water and formaldehyde, we compared the non-null cubic and

quartic  terms  calculated  with  the  (E)  and  (E-G)  methods,  as  well  as  the  efficiency  and

accuracy of the two grids selected.

A.  Quartic force field of H2O

44 calculations were needed with the type (E) regression method, and 11 and 10 with

an (E-G) method, depending on the grid used in order to determine the 22 non-null parameters

(see table 3).

In general and regardless of the plan used for the (E-G) method, the quartic force field

was practically unchanged, since its mean difference is 0.6 cm-1 for the simplex-sum grid and

was 1.30 cm-1 for the  Koshal  grid in comparison to the force field  deduced with method (E)

that we adopted as a reference.

All  coefficients  were  well  represented  except  for  the  term  k1133  determined  with  the

(E-G) method using the  Koshal grid which is not significant, since its value is twice its error

bar.  Whether  this  term  is  determined  at  -2.6  ±  0.4,  -1.3  ±  0.5  or  0.0,  its  impact  on  the

anharmonic correction of vibrational frequencies is minorii.

If the two plans are compared in terms of efficiency, taking the symmetry properties of

the molecule into account, it is seen that the number of grid points that can be deduced8 is 4

for the simplex-sum plan and 1 for the  Koshal  plan.  Thus,  the  efficiency  of  the  two  plans  is

comparable in terms of the number of calculations.

                                                
ii i.e. a diagonal contribution (the greatest) of 1 cm-1 on vibrational states n 1 and n 3.

In  this  example,  it  is  nevertheless  preferable  to  use  the  simplex-sum  design  since  the  mean

error it generates on the force field, estimated at 0.3 cm-1, is lower than that of the Koshal plan

(0.9 cm-1).

B.  Quartic force field of H2CO

The  fourth  order  force  field  of  formaldehyde  (see  table  4)  has  84  non  vanishing

parameters.  168  calculations  of  the  molecular  wave  function  were  carried  out  with  the

reference  method,  44  with  the  (E-G)  method  using  the  simplex-sum  plan,  and  45  using  the

Koshal grid.

From a general standpoint, cubic force constants were correctly determined by the (E-

G) method and the dispersion of mean error, of the order of 0.1 cm-1, was low. Even so, the

values  of  fourth  order  force  constants  are  more  uncertain,  although  the  results  converged

within about 1 cm-1. These non-significant values (in italic in the table) are in greater number

when the (E-G) method is used.

Nevertheless, the  13  forces  constants  cancelled on the basis of  the  error  criterion  for

the (E) method were also cancelled for the (E-G) method. In the case of the simplex-sum grid,

the  6  additional  parameters  (k1135,  k1144,  k2556,  k3345,  k3355,  k4456)  cancelled  by  the  (E-G)

method but not by the (E) method are of only slight importance since they did not exceed 3

cm-1. The Koshal grid poses more problems since it is evident that there are some relatively

large terms poorly represented (k2266, k2666, k3455, k4555, k4455 ).

Comparison of the two plans used for the (E-G) method shows that the simplex-sum grid is

more  accurate  since  it  leads  to  a  lower  mean  error,  lower  dispersion,  and  results  that  are  in

better agreement with the reference method. It is also just as effective as the Koshal plan since

it enables better use of the symmetry properties of the molecule.

V. 

CONCLUSION

The  REGRESS  EGH  code  developed  in  our  laboratory  enables  the  inclusion  of

energies  and  their  nth  analytical  derivative  with  respect  to  nuclear  parameters  in  the  same

linear  regression  process.  This  leads  to  the  determination  of  a  complete  fourth  order  force

field  by  optimal  use  of  available  data  on  the  molecular  wave  function.  We  have  also

implemented  an  algorithm  to  calculate  the  statistical  error  of  polynomial  parameters.  This

approach enables the selection of significant parameters in the description of the potential.

Using  the  example  of  complete  quartic  force  fields  of  the  water  and  formaldehyde

molecules, we have illustrated the accuracy obtained with the (E-G) method with two grids.

The primary conclusion from this work is that the simplex-sum grid truncated at the third sum

provides  results  in  excellent  agreement  with  results  obtained  with  the  type  (E)  method.  In

terms  of  efficiency,  it  is  even  better  than  the  Koshal  plan  when  the  molecule  has  some

This  code  tested  on  small  size  systems,  should  be  useful  for  the  anharmonic

vibrational  treatment  of  bigger  size  molecules.  To  this  end,  the  vibrational  study  of

acetonitrile15  and  its  efficiency  of  treatment  due  to  the  (E-G)  method  will  be  presented  in  a

symmetry.

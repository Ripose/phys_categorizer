Abstract:
It is shown that the mathematical form, obtained in a recent paper, for the angular
momentum of the electromagnetic field in the vicinity of electric charge is equivalent to
another form obtained previously.

The angular momentum J(t) of the classical electromagnetic field in terms of the electric
E(x,t) and magnetic field B(x,t) [1]

J(t) = 1

[E(x,t) · B(x,t)] 

(Gaussian units, bold font denotes a three-vector) has been treated in a paper published
recently [2] by means of the Helmholtz theorem on the decomposition of vector fields. It
was shown there that the angular momentum associated with a volume of space far from
the influence of electric charge may be expressed as a sum of three terms: a) a volume
integral of angular momentum of spin-like character, b) a volume integral of angular
momentum of orbital-like character and c) a surface integral. It was found to be essential
[3, 4] to take account of the surface integral in order to understand the apparent paradox,
from (1), that a plane wave appears to carry no angular momentum in the direction of
propagation while experiment [5] shows that it does.

In [2] an expression for the "bound" angular momentum Jb associated with the

presence of electric charge density  (x,t) was also obtained. It is given by

where  (cid:209)

x is the gradient operator with respect to x.
We note that if the linear coordinate vector y is replaced by x in the integral (2)

above, as shown immediately below,

where the transverse component of the vector potential At is given by [6, 7]

Another expression for the bound angular momentum

was obtained by Cohen-Tannoudji et al. [8] p 46 equ. (7) using a different method. They
expressed their result in terms of a discrete charge distribution rather than the continuous
charge distribution  (x). Equation (4) is the continuum generalisation of equation (6).
These authors also used the abstract quantity At for the transverse vector potential. They did
not provide the explicit expression for the transverse vector potential given by (5).

Equation (2) will be mathematically equivalent to equations (3) and (4) only if the

following vector integral I vanishes

I = d 3y

In the remainder of this letter we show that the vector integral I does indeed vanish and so
(2) and (4) are equivalent forms of expressing the bound angular momentum of the
electromagnetic field.

By using the vector identity

we can express the integrand of (7) as a triple vector product

Equation (16) cancels (11) so it is proved that the integral I vanishes and the two
mathematical forms (2) and (4) for the "bound" angular momentum are equivalent.

Abstract 

 

 

 

I. Introduction 

We consider two equations for the filling factor estimation of infiltrated zinc oxide (ZnO) in 

silica  (SiO2)  opal  and  gallium  nitride  in  ZnO  opal.  The  first equation is based on the effective 

medium  approximation,  while  the  second  one  –  on  Maxwell-Garnett  approximation.  The 

comparison between two filling factors shows that both equations can be equally used for the 
estimation of the quantity of infiltrated nanocrystals inside opal matrix Ì.

Photonic crystals (PhCs) with forbidden band-gaps, proposed by Eli Yablonovitch 1 and Sajeev 
John  2,  open  new  opportunities  for  their  applications  in  modern  optics.  PhCs  are  one-,  two-,  and 

three-dimensional  dielectric  lattices  with  periodicity  on  the  order  of  the  optical  wavelengths.  The 

implementations of PhCs are mostly aimed to improve the useful properties of various materials as 
well  as  opto-electronic  devises  such  as  light  emitting  diodes  3,  laser  diodes  4,  optical  fibers  5. 

Nowadays  research  on  PhCs  becomes  an  increasingly  important  in  the  fundamental  and  applied 

sciences. 

One of the kinds of PhCs is an opal matrix consisting of spherical sub-micron balls packed into 
face centered cubic (FCC) structure by means of self-sedimentation in a fluid suspension 6, 7. Silicon 

dioxide  (SiO2)  or  silica  is  frequently  used  as  a  host  material  in  artificial  opals.  Silica  balls  are 

synthesized  by  Stöber-Fink-Bohn  process  through  the  hydrolysis  of  tetraethylorthosilicate  in  the 
ethanol solution mixed with ammonium hydroxide and water 8. 

The  applications  of  opal  PhCs  have  number  of  significant  advantages  over  others.  For 

instance,  the  opal  matrix  can  be  grown  over  a  large  practically  unlimited  plane  area.  Their

fabrication is very technological without requirement for expensive equipment. It has been recently 

shown that by means of electro-deposition the high quality two- and three-dimensional porous films, 
patterned in inverted opal, can be successfully realized  9. Thus, the nanocrystals grown in artificial 

opal can be regarded as inexpensive and efficient alternative for electro- and photolithography. 

The fabrication of high quality artificial opal by natural self-sedimentation in monodispersed 
fluid  suspension  may  continue  for  a  long  period,  up  to  ten  months  6.  However  this  drawback  is 

resolved  in  electrophoretically  assisted  sedimentation  involving  an  external  electric  filed.  Such  an 

original technology enables one to accelerate a sedimentation velocity up to 0.2-0.7 mm per hour for 
the balls ranging in diameter between 300 - 550 nm 10. 

By means of the various chemical depositions, the voids of the opal matrix can be filled with 

semiconductors (GaAs, CdS, HgSe, Si, InN/GaN, CdTl, InP, ZnO, ZnS), superconductors (In, Pb) 
ferromagnetic materials (Fe and alloys)  11. Different infiltration methods including chemical vapor 
deposition 12, 13, chemical bath deposition 12, hydrolysis 12, salt-precipitation 13, sol-gel 13, 14, electro-
deposition  9,  13,  spray  pyrolysis  13,  15,  16,  etc.  can  be  applied  for  formation  of  nanoparticles  in 

interglobular spaces of opal matrix. 

Figure  1  shows  an  experimental  set  for  observation  of  Bragg  reflection  from  the  surface  of 

opal matrix with perfectly assembled FCC structure. The reflection peak of the light is governed by

a  is the distance between planes, h, k, l

perfectly ordered balls, the experimental 

data excellently fit Bragg’s law. Peak in 

reflectance  (or  dip  in  transmittance) 

shifts 

to 

the  blue  spectrum  with 

increasing  angle  according  to  (1).  However,  an  opal  with  imperfectly  ordered  silica  balls  behaves 

differently.  

Consider Figure 2 showing the SEM image of the opal, which FCC structure has dislocations, 

formed during the self-sedimentation process in a fluid suspension. The sample contains micro-size 

domains with facing up (111) and (100) planes. These domains are chaotically distributed within the 

sample and differently tilted with respect to its surface. As a result, the blue-shift in reflectance (or 
in transmittance) becomes insignificant and irregular with increasing angle  17,  18. It signifies that in 

highly  imperfect  or  in  amorphous  opal  the  color  remains  practically  stable  at  any  θ  (Figure  1). 

Despite  of  the  fact  that  such  sample  does  not  exhibit  the  blue-shift  with  increasing  angle,  the 

influence of photonic band-gap (PBG) in opal with disordered FCC structure is possible to observe 

conclusively either in evolution of photoluminescence arising due to gradual increase of the filling 
factor or in temperature-dependent photoluminescence 16. 

It  is  worth  remarking  that  imperfect  opal  structures exhibit spectrum with greater FWHM in 
reflection  (or  transmission)  19.  While  perfectly  ordered  opal  matrix  may  find  its  applications  in 
various  light  emitting  devices  3,  4,  imperfectly  assembled  and/or  amorphous  opal  with  embedded 
luminescent nanoparticles might be useful for applications in full-color displays 16.

Nanoparticles infiltrated in interglobular spaces can considerably alter the optical properties of 

opal matrix. Therefore the estimation of the quantity of infiltrated nanocrystals plays significant role 

in  practice.  Particularly,  the  amount  of  infiltrated material has to be properly controlled during its 

deposition in the voids. 

This  paper  reports  two  filling  factor  equations  based  on  effective  medium  and  Maxwell-

Garnett  approximations.  The  comparison  between  them  shows  that  both  equations  can  be  equally 

used for quantity estimation of infiltrated nanoparticles in interglobular spaces between FCC packed 

spheres.  

 

II. Equations for filling factor estimation 

2.1 Refractive index based on effective medium approximation 

The  quantitative  analysis  of  the  optical  characteristics  of  opal  matrix  can  be  significantly 
simplified introducing the effective refractive index according to effective medium approximation 20. 

Effective refractive index can be defined as a weighted sum of indices of refraction n1, n2, n3, for 

spherical balls, infiltrated nanoparticles and air, respectively. For the bare and infiltrated opals, the 

effective refractive indices accordingly are

where  f  is  the  filling  factor  for  infiltrated  nanocrystals.  The  values  0.74  and  0.26  are  the  filling 

factors for the host material (spherical balls) and air, respectively. 

It is convenient to assume a low angle of incidence (Figure 1). Substitution of definitions (2a, 

b) into (1) yields wavelengths 

1λ , 

2λ  for the bare and infiltrated opals. The refractive indices for the 

spherical balls and infiltrated nanoparticles are both, in general, wavelength dependent.  

The  red-shift  in  reflectance  or  transmittance  spectra  arising  due  to  infiltrated  nanocrystals 

inside opal matrix can be found as

2.2 Effective refractive index based on Maxwell-Garnett approximation 

Another  definition  for  effective  refractive  indices,  also  widely  used  in  practice,  is  based  on 
Maxwell-Garnett approximation 21. Effective refractive indices for the bare and infiltrated opals can 

be expressed as a weighted sum of the squared refractive indices

3.1 Refractive indices of silicon dioxide and zinc oxide 

Figure  3  shows  the  refractive  indices  for  silicon  dioxide  and  zinc  oxide  vs.  wavelength. 

Analytical  form  of 

( )λ1n

  and 

( )λ2n

,  obtained  via  Sellmeier  dispersion  approximation  (12),  quite 

accurately fit data available in literature 25, 26. The refractive index of ZnO may be considered a flat 

only at the wavelengths above 450 nm where in the most of the visible range it is equal to around 2. 

Below  this  point,  the  refractive  index  of  ZnO  has  strong  wavelength  dependence  and  its  curve 

rapidly rises due to resonance occurring between valence and conduction bands.  

6

Contrarily, the curve for the silicon dioxide is nearly flat and consequently its refractive index 

can  be  considered  a  constant  over  the  wide  optical  range  covering  near  infrared  (IR)  to  near 

ultraviolet (UV) spectra. Taking this into account and considering the fact that refractive index of air 

is very close to unity, (4) and (6) can be simplified and approximated as

 are comparatively high and their relative error strongly depends on diameter of silica 

balls. For UV opal with D = 170 nm the relative error is almost 10%, while for IR opal with D = 310 

nm it is less than 4%. For all other opals with small infiltrations the relative errors are less than 8%.

error does not further increase with decreasing average diameter of balls.  

At the high infiltrations the relative errors are negligible for UV and purple-blue opals. For all 

other  opals  they  do  not  exceed  5%.  Discrepancies  between  filling  factors  show  that  each  of  two 

simplified  equations  (13)  and  (14)  can  be  used  for  the  quantity  estimation  of  infiltrated  material 

inside silica opal. However, it should be taken into account that for the small amount of infiltration 

in UV opal the discrepancy may be relatively high, nearly 10%. 

 
IV. Filling factors for opal matrix comprising ZnO balls 

In fact, both equations (2a) and (7a) contain term 

, which is itself, generally, may depend on 

1n

value 

1λ . Therefore when the refractive index of balls is a function of the wavelength, either of two 

equations (2a), (7a) contains two unknowns, namely 1λ  and 
analytically  due  to  complicated  form  of  Sellmeier  dispersion  formula  (12).  Iterating  loop  28  is  a 

. This problem cannot be resolved

useful and efficient programming method to solve numerically such a task. The basic objective in 

computation is to determine 

1λ  and

(
1 λn

, given by (2a) and (7a) via (12). Having known the exact 

values 

1λ   and 

(
)1
1 λn

,  the  filling  factors 

)λ∆1f
(

, 

)λ∆2f
(

  can  be  readily  found  through 

corresponding equations (4) and (9), respectively.  

 The  novel  approach  in  fabrication  of  artificial  opal  comprising  ZnO  balls  has  been  reported 
recently 19. Refractive index of ZnO in the near UV spectrum is very high, exceeding 9 at the band 

 

9

edge  25,  26.  Therefore,  having  such  a  high  value  of  the  refractive  index,  ZnO  might  be  regarded  a 

possible candidate in fabrication of opal matrix with complete PBG. 

Gallium nitrate (GaN) can be synthesized inside the voids of opal matrix by means of chemical 
deposition,  which  details  described  elsewhere  29.  Suppose  that  GaN  is  infiltrated  in  ZnO  opal.  In 

such  a  combination 

1n

  and 

2n

  are  refractive  indices  for  ZnO  balls  and  GaN,  respectively.  Unlike 

silica, ZnO is strongly wavelength dependent in the near UV region. Due to this reason, simplified 

equations (13) and (14) cannot be applied for opal comprising ZnO balls when 

1 <λ

450

 nm. 

The  algorithm  for  computation  of 

1λ   and 

(
)1
1 λn

  is  straightforward.  Consider 1λ   and 

(
)1
1 λn

, 

related to effective medium approximation. Choose an arbitrary trial value of 

1λ , say 500 nm, and 

include  it  into  Sellmeier  dispersion  formula  (12).  Find  the  corresponding  refractive  index  of  balls 

(
)1
1 λn

 and substitute it into (2a). Calculate 

1λ  and compare it with previous value. If the difference 

between them is large, include the recent value 

1λ  into Sellmeier dispersion formula and repeat all 

calculations again. Continue the same procedures if the difference between the recent and previous 

values of 

1λ  is not greater than some small epsilon, say 

310 −

 nm.  

The  computation  of 

1λ   and 

)1
(
1 λn

,  related  to  Maxwell-Garnett  approximation,  is  absolutely 

similar  with  the  only  difference  that  it  employs  (7a)  instead  of  (2a).  Typically  the  iteration 

consisting of just 20-40 calculation cycles (steps) is sufficient to get a required precision.

The right part of Table 1 converges faster to the desired values due to squared form of (7a).  

Figure 6 shows filling factors and their relative error for ZnO opal infiltrated with GaN. The 

filling  factors  do  not  intercept.    The  curve  for 

  grows  faster  than  that  for 

,  consequently  the

relative  error  monotonically  increase.  At  the  origin  the  relative  error  is  small,  less  than  6%. 

However,  at  complete  infiltration  the  discrepancy  between  filling  factors  becomes  relatively  high, 

reaching almost 16%.

Figure  7  shows  the  refractive  indices 
of  GaN  24  and  ZnO  25,  26.  In  the  visible 

spectrum  the  refractive  index  of  GaN  is 

higher than that of ZnO.

Analyzing (4) and (9) one can see that 

ZnO

the  relative  error  mostly  depends  on  the 

diameter  of  the  balls  and  the  difference 

between  refractive  indices  of  the  host  and

relative  error  between  filling  factors.  For 

silica  opal 

infiltrated  with  ZnO 

the 

difference  between  refractive  indices  is 

about 0.5 and more in the visible spectrum, while for ZnO opal infiltrated with GaN it is less than 

0.35 (Figure 7). As a result, the relative error for infiltrated ZnO opal is higher.  It should be noted, 

however, that for the visible spectral range, the relative error between filling factors does not exceed 

17.5 % even at complete infiltration.  

V. Conclusion 

Two  equations  for  the  filling  factor  estimation  of  infiltrated  ZnO  in  silica  opal  and  GaN  in 

ZnO  opal  have  been  considered.  The  first  equation  is  based  on  effective  medium  approximation, 

while the second one – on Maxwell-Garnett approximation.  

Filling  factor  equations  can  be  simplified  for  silica  opal  because  of  its  week  dependence  of 

refractive index on wavelength. However, the filling factor equations for opal comprising ZnO balls 

requires a numerical solution. 

The  comparison  between  filling  factors  shows  that  both  of  them  can  be  equally  used  for 

quantity estimation of infiltrated material inside opal matrix. However, at complete infiltration the 

relative  error  between  filling  factors  for  ZnO  opal  infiltrated  with  GaN  may  exceed  15%  due  to 

small refractive index contrast between zinc oxide balls and infiltrated gallium nitride nanoparticles.

Abstract 

The measurements of the electronic charge e, by Ehrenhaft and Millikan in the 

1910’s generated a bitter controversy between the “orthodox” and the atomic points of 

views. Guided by the Pauli-Fermi neutrino model for beta-decay in this paper we 

speculate that the introduction of a small hypothetical force is adequate to account for 

most of the contentious differences between Millikan’s and Ehrenhaft’s observations. 

 
 

 

 

 

1 

The electrical charge of an electron, e is one of the most precisely measured 

constants of nature. Currently, the committee on data for science and technology 

(CODATA) value of e is 1.602 176 53 x10-19 C with a standard uncertainty of 14 in the 

last two digits1. It is an established fact that e is not an average value instead it is the 

quantum or the least amount of free electric charge. Also an object may only have a total 

charge exactly equal to integral multiples of e.  Indeed the atomic nature of matter and 

the theory of quantum mechanics seem self evident in contemporary science.  

 

Remarkably, the acceptance of quantization was far from automatic, challenge to 

the new paradigm continued well into the 1900’s. Both the “orthodox and the heterodox” 

sides were confronted with the discoveries of atomic structure and radioactivity. Notables 

such as Born, Lorentz, Mach, Planck, Schrodinger, Sommerfeld and others were involved 

in the debate.  At this time the pioneering measurements of e were in progress, its exact 

value and whether it has a minimum value were vigorously contested2. Confirmation of 

the quantization of e was one of the corner stones for the acceptance of the atomic theory 

and hence the “modern” perspective of physical sciences.  

 

As mentioned above the question of the electric charge of an electron was 

very contentious. Two of the main protagonists in this controversy were R.A. Millikan3 

and F. Ehrenhaft4. Millikan5 argued that his oil drop experiment provided direct proof for 

quantization. That is (i) there is a minimum unit of electric charge e, and (ii) the charge of 

any object occurs in whole number multiples of this unit. Quantitatively, expressed as 

histograms of number of observations vs the measured charge q, Millikan’s graph is 

 

 

2 

discreet and sharp, as can be seen in figure 1. In contrast Ehrenhaft using the best 

instrumentations in extant such as the ultra microscope refuted Millikan’s ideas and 

introduced the idea of subelectronic charges4. Claiming better accounting of all the forces 

and a wider parameter range Ehrenhaft reported electrical charge on metal particulates 

often are smaller than e and deviates from multiplicity. His distribution is broad, the 

minimum value of the measured charge qmin appears to be substantially smaller than e; 

also a significant part (shown grey) of counts correspond to sub-electronic charge and the 

width of each broad maxima is comparable to Millikan’s unit step. However, in our 

opinion the sub-electron issue aside Ehrenhaft ought to have noticed the periodicity 

(quantization) in the charge distribution in his own data.  

Curiously, in a number ways the differences in the Millikan and Ehrenhaft’s 

histograms are paralleled by the spectra of alpha and beta decay. And not surprisingly 

during the early years of nuclear physics this difference also created considerable 

consternations.  In this article we speculate if the Millikan-Ehrenhaft conundrum can be 

resolved a la’ Fermi.   

The spectra of Alpha decays are sharp and well defined with energy in the ~ 

MeV range, the typical nuclear energy scale. In contrast the main beta distributions, the 

continuous spectrum are broad and only a few decays attain million electron volts of 

energy.  These differences confounded then current ideas about the validity of 

conservation laws of nature.  The Pauli- Fermi neutrino hypothesis is the solution of the 

α−β paradox. Fermi6 argued that in both types of decays conservation laws must remain 

valid. He postulated that Pauli’s charge less neutral particle neutrino, must accompany

the beta emission so that the mother nucleus shares momenta and energy with both the 

emitted electron (positron) as well as the neutrino. In this scenario, a third party the 

elusive neutrino caries away and hence obscures the energy (momentum) missing in the 

beta spectra. Fermi was courageous in bestowing such a critical role to the then 

undiscovered neutrino! The success of Fermi’s theory was one of the confirmations of the 

quantum mechanical principles and impetuses that led to the eventual experimental 

observation of the neutrino. 

In the case of e-measurement there was a heated controversy as to the correct 

determination of the particle mass and the response (force) of the surrounding medium 

(air). In practice both are determined from the balance of the weight force and the drag 

force at the terminal velocity of the particle under zero applied electric field.  Each side 

debated the correct accounting of them. Millikan considered the drag to be a Stokes force 

calculated form 

F

κ=

V

Ter

Stoke

here the Stokes parameter κ depends on the particle 

geometry as well as the terminal velocity (V

Ter) of the particle. It has been stated that 

Ehrenhaft was incorrect and a “failure” where as Millikan was a “success” 2. However 

Ehrenhaft was a well-established physicist and employed sophisticated instrumentation 

and methodology2. For the present let us grant that each experimenter were employing 

the correct force appropriate to their respective particles. Hence, both could have been 

right. We will speculate on such a possibility in this paper.

Let us first consider Millikan’s experiment in this case the forces on an oil drop of 

charge q and mass m is shown in figure 3a. The force balance between the downward 

weight and FStoke with the upward electric force may be written as

            1b 

Where E is the applied electric field, V0 is the terminal velocity under gravity (when E=0) 

and VE is the terminal velocity with E applied.  

For Ehrenhaft’s setup let us consider the scenario that in addition to the force due 

to the medium (Fdrag) a (hypothetical) force X acts on the charged metal particle, as 

shown in figure 3b. Here it is postulated that X force arises only in presence of the 

applied field.  With the X force present the vertical force balance equation would now 

become,

            2 

In equation 2, θ is the angle between the electric force and the hypothetical force X and 

ranges between 0 and 180 degrees. The subscripts “x” refers to the values when X is 

present. However if one is unaware of the existence of X then one will be lead to believe

that the charge on the particle is qx. In other words, for the same particle mass and 

measured terminal velocities, one would insist as in equation 1,

If we call q as the Millikan value and qx to be that for Ehrenhaft then from

For an Ehrenhaft particle of radius ~10-8 m and density ~104 kg/m3 the estimated mass is

force then for X one would estimate,

Concluding remarks 

 

Here we have speculated that in the e-measurements there may be an additional 

force X. The magnitude of X is different in the two experiments of interest. In one, it is 

negligibly small and in the other, its contributions cannot be ignored. 

Millikan’s particles were an order of magnitude larger in size than Ehrenhaft’s, 

oils are typically non conducting dielectrics and liquid drops tend to be spherically 

7 

 

 

 

shaped. Although in the 1900’s it was impossible to resolve the geometry of  submicron 

particles, as can be seen in the electro-micrograph (Figure 4)  most likely metal particles 

Ehrenhaft’s (Pt, Ag, Au, etc)were non-spherical in shape. These differences in electrical 

properties, size and shape may be the reason why X is a more critical factor for Ehrenhaft.  

 

Conductivity is emphasized because X appears only when the electric field is non- 

zero. In addition it may also be of relevance to a more modern search for free quarks in 

niobium particles reported in “Evidence for the Existence of Fractional Charge on 

Matter”7. Compared with dielectric oil drops high conductivity metal particles will create 

far larger perturbations in the applied electric field distribution.  If this force show up 

only under certain suitable conditions then such perturbations may go unnoticed but be 

sufficient to generate false estimates of charge. Because, large electric fields are not 

common in nature X may remain undetected if not specifically searched for. Needless to 

say at the minimum this is an extreme heretical idea but such forces can be of great 

relevance in many important nanoscale systems.

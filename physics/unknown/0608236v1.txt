Abstract:  In  the  first  part  of  the  present  paper  we  give  an  analysis  of  the  ontic  nature  of
quantum states to be intended as potentialities and of the central role of spin to be considered
as the basic essence of quantum mechanical reality: using an algebraic quantum like structure
we  give  mathematical  proof  on  the  transition  from  potentiality  to  actualization  :  we    recall
here  what  was  recently  given  by  us  in  arXiv  quant-ph/0607196.  However,  as  may  be
expected, it is not so easy to introduce examples containing an adequate description of ontic
potentialities through detailed models of systems. The central aim of this paper is to  attempt
to reach this objective giving direct cases of systems in which ontic potentialities act jointly
to actualization. Our aim is to provide evidence for the possible importance of potential states
in  the  sphere  of  the  biological  dynamics  giving  detailed  examples  of  interest  for  biological
studies.  We  outline  the  possible  implications  of  potentialities  at  the  level  of  linear  and  non
linear biological dynamics.

1.  Introduction
It  is  known  that  the  problem  of  how  a  mathematical  superposition  of  manifold  possibilities
evolves  to  become  a  particular  observable  actuality,  represents  the  basic  unsolved  problem  of
measurement in quantum mechanics. In some sense it delineates also a basic unsolved question
of our science and  knowledge. In fact, the present quantum problem may be considered the last
more    modern  version  of  a  problematicism  and  a  debate  that  involved  our  science  and
philosophy    from  the  past,  starting  with  Empedocle,  Plato  and  the  same  Aristotle  who  first
considered that potentia and actuality are two kinds of reality and that actualities give origin to
potentia  which  give  origin  to  actualities.  W.  Heisenberg  evidenced  the  value  of  quantum
mechanics in this Aristotelian basic principle. On the other hand, quantum theory is not able to
reach adequate evidence on the nature of such potential entities, on their qualification between
their  quantum  actualizations  and,  finally,  on  the  same  mathematical  and  physical  features
regulating the transition in our reality from  potential to actual entities. The  aim of the present
paper  is  to  move  in  the  framework  of  a  quantum  like  formulation,  giving  for  the  first  time  a
mathematical proof of such possible transition from potential to actual entities in our reality and
simultaneously  describing  the  mathematical  and  physical  features  that  characterize  such
transition.
Before to proceed with the mathematical proof, we need to deepen two important questions. The
first relates the nature of the quantum states and the second considers the nature of the spin. We
retain  that  this  last  quantum  observable  represents  the  essence  of  quantum  mechanics  and

therefore  our  proof  will  be  based  on  the  utilization  at  the  algebraic  level  of  basic  abstract
elements that, as we shall see, move in direct analogy with the notion of spin.

2. Some Observations on the Nature of  Quantum States.
Let  us  start  with  a  preliminary    analysis  on  the  notion  of  quantum  state.  The  problem  here  is
well  known.  Let  us  consider  a  particle,  as  example  an  electron,  impinging  on  a  screen.
According to quantum mechanics we cannot know where it  will hit but  we can always  assign
probabilities to potentialities of the electron to hit at different locations. These are given by the
well known wave function or quantum  state of  the system we have  in  consideration. At some
time, the electron impinges into some point of the screen and since it hits the screen, we have no
more a matter of probability. The quantum state has collapsed into some  definite  point on the
screen. The arising question is on the nature of the quantum state. In an epistemic interpretation
we consider that the quantum state describes not the  system in  consideration  but our  status of
knowledge about it. In an ontic interpretation we admit instead that the quantum states are ontic
and this is to say  that  they  describe  the system  as  it  is.  The point here  is  to  consider  an  ontic
nature  of    the  quantum  state  but  the  settlement  of  its  definition  is  paved  with  conceptual
difficulties.  Some  possibilities  to  proceed  with  an  ontic  interpretation  of  quantum  states  were
previously explored [1]. However, undoubtedly, it is not so easy to introduce an adequate notion
of ontic potentialities in our reality. As example, it seems rather an approximation for defect to
consider here a superposition state of potentialities  meaning that the  system can be in two or
more states at the same time. In fact, we must remember here that the entity in consideration is a
potential and not an  actual entity.  It must be considered to be real, ontologically significant, but
not  being  actual.  By  the  previous  definition  we  ran  the  risk  to  consider  the  coexistence  of
potentialities as an actual like form, that is a superposition of coexisting like actualities and this
is not  what  the  quantum  superposition  principle  admits.  This  is  one  first  difficulty.  One  other
question arises in the following manner. Let us consider two quantum non commuting entities A
and B. Quantum mechanics tells us that, if one  such entity, say A, is actualized, B consequently
remains  an  undefined  potentiality.  In  our  opinion  ,  this  is  an  ontic  holistic  process  that  must
receive  a  proper  general,  mathematical  formalization  while  instead  in  this  case  the  traditional
quantum  formalism,  based  on  the    Hilbert  space  formulation,  holds  only    the  requirement  of
mutually orthogonal vectors that are representative of the mutual exclusivity of the states. The
consequent mutual exclusivity of outcome states is merely an  epistemic phenomenon and thus
ontologically  insignificant  while  instead  we  need  in  this  case  an  holistic  description  having  a
full ontological  explanation. This  is one of  the  reasons  because  we introduce  in  the  following
section  a  quantum  like  schema,  not    based  as  traditionally  on  quantum  linear  operators  and
Hilbert spaces, but  fixed instead on an algebraic structure and its  formalization and where the
auspicated  ontological  significance  of  the  holistic  process  regarding  at  the  same  time  the
actualization of the entity A and the persisting  potentiality of the entity B, is reached through
the  proof  of  the  theorem  2.  Here  the  notion  of  holism  linking  actuality  to  potentiality    seems
absolutely  necessary. In conclusion, we like more to steer ourselves into a different definition
[see  also  1]  considering  an  ontic  superposition  of  potentialities  meaning  an  ontic  holistic
entanglement where no more independently existing features of potentiality as  actual like forms
may  be  identified.  In  addition,  linked  coexisting  forms  of  actuality  and  potentiality  must  be
expected in our reality still in a whole holistic ontological framework. We would also give some
evidence about such definitions. Let us admit hypothetically an existing system S that may be
ψ , and a potential state that is given in a
represented by an actual state, that we identify by

PX   may  be  considered  to  randomly  assume  an  actualized  value  of  +1  or  of  -1
at  some time 
giving  in  this  case  a  final  actualized  value  for  the  whole    evolution  process  in  consideration.
This  is  an  example  of    potential  –  actualized  process  that  at  last  in  principle  is  based  on  a
quantum  like  scheme.  As  we  see,  it  changes  radically  our  traditional  view  on  dynamics  of
ψ . However, with
reality. The time evolution of the system starts with the actualized value 
basic  difference  respect  to  our  traditional  view  on  evolution  processes,  it  has  also  the
. This is an intrinsic potentiality of such evolution
potentiality to be or 
process. In the future steps of the evolution the system maintains its potentialities that at each
stage  will  be  given  directly  by  the  basic  mathematical  features  of  the  map.  An  occurring
actualization of the process randomly  at some time will attribute to 
PX  a definite value, or +1
or -1, and this actualization will enable the evolution process to  actualize  a final value of the
evolutive  process  that  will  account  also  of  the    previously    unexpressed  (unactualized)
potentialities.
Consider another scheme that may be of basic importance in studies on biological dynamics and
in the non linear analysis of systems.
Let us assume the following logistic map
x
It  is  known  that  it  represents  one  of  the  most  investigated  deterministic  chaotic  maps.  Its
properties  of  chaotic  deterministic  behaviour  for 
  are  well  known  and  well
established  [2,  soon  after  increase  reference  number  of  one].  We  may  extend  such  map  in  a
quantum like scheme so to give a logistic map with included potential quantum like features. In
this case the usual logistic map becomes

second  map  pertains  instead  to  the  potential  component  of  the  given  quantum  like  logistic
nB . At each stage of the iteration  such potential component also experiences the presence

nA . We see that our traditional manner to look at the processes
of the actualized component by 
of our reality, changes radically. Now, potential and actual entities cooperate to  give  the  time
dynamics of the considered process. As a model we introduce basic quantum like systems and
mathematically,  we  propose  to  consider  dynamical  systems  in  Clifford  algebras.  We  will
explore in detail such new non linear  phenomenology in following papers.

We may  also  examine  more  articulated  quantum  schemes  in  which  the  potential  contribution,

the (11) of the following section and realizing in this manner a quantum like scheme in which
also the contributions of the  non commutativity are taken in consideration.
 In  conclusion,  we  retain  that  quantum  potentialities,  as  roughly  expressed  by  the  previous
model, find their principal  arena in the sphere of the biological matter. In   the last section of
this  paper,  we  will  give  some  detailed  examples  of  biological  themes  in  which    symbolic
potential entities as 
P,iX  may be involved. Potentialities may explain their decisive  role when
discussing the basic theme of the Neodarwinism that of course  was just the object of  a recent
investigation  in the framework of quantum potentialities [2 to be increased by one]. In this case
what radically changes respect to our traditional manner to conceive evolution is that in classical
Neodarwinism we have  evolution essentially intended as consequence of random variations and
natural  selection  of  what  is  the  fittest  form.  Here  we  have  selection  of  forms  of  concrete  and
actual  matter.  Instead  in  the  case  of  the  evolution  model    previously  introduced  and  having
potentialities, we have similarly a final selection  of concrete and actual forms but the arena of
the  possible  differentiation  is  extremely  different  and,  in  particular,  forms  of  potentiality  this
time coexist with forms of actuality, and potentiality contributes to characterize actual forms at
each stage of the evolution. It is sufficient to look at the previously given relation to convince
that  we  are  in  fact  in  presence  of  a    radically  new  kind  of  evolution  mechanism    where,  we
repeat,  forms  of  potentiality  coexist  with  forms  of  actuality.  The  result  is  in  a  new  structure
which makes possible many more possible and different pathways that result impossible in an
evolution  mechanism  based  only  on  actualization.  At  the  same  time  it  is  the  basic  concept  of
reality that changes radically in the sense that in the traditional case it is the concrete and actual
matter that constitutes the ontological reference of a basic materialistic instance while instead in
such new case matter must be considered in its potential form to be  envisaged in addition to its
actual form.

3. Observations on the Nature of  Spin.
W. Pauli was the physicist that had a decisive role in the elaboration of the quantum theory of spin.
Initially,  he  called  the  spin  a  “two-valued  quantum  degree  of  freedom”.  On  the  basis  of  this
definition, we retain that initially he considered the spin as a kind of physical-logical -informative
entity linked to matter at the microphysical level.   His  definition  of  spin  remained  initially  rather
vague and  uncharacterized  until R. Kroning in 1925 suggested that it would be produced by the
self-rotation of the electron. This was an idea that Pauli initially criticized severely but Kroning’s
view on spin was subsequently supported from G.Uhlenbeck and S. Goudsmit in the same year, and
finally  Pauli,  despite  his  initial  objections  to  this  idea,  formalized  the  theory  of  spin  in  1927,
accepting  to  characterize  it  as  self-rotation  of  a  quantum  particle.  He  pioneered  the  use  of  the  so
called  Pauli  matrices  as  a  representation  of  spin  operators,  and  he  introduced  a  two-component
spinor wave function. His spin-theory was not relativistic. In 1928 P. Dirac described the relativistic
electron with a four component spinor, and he  found that the spin is a relativistic effect that may be
identified by linearization of the Hamiltonian in special relativity [3].
At the present we are convinced that the spin represents an entity of Nature whose meaning and role
are    more  general,  indeed  universal,  with  respect  to  the  rather  restrictive    interpretation  that  was
originally  formulated by Kroning, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit. We retain that the following examples
are of basic importance to accept our thesis. Quantum computing has introduced the qubit quantum
register.  Here  a  universal    unity  of  information  is  formulated  in  quantum  mechanical  terms  and
information no longer results a rather abstract entity but  for the first time it is  really and tangiblely
connected to a material object as an elementary particle. In addition, P. O’Hara [4] obtained that the
spin is introduced in a natural way into the space-time metric, taking the square root of the metric

associated  with  space  Also  other  authors,  as  P.  Cordero,  C.  Teitelboim,  and  R.  Tabensky  [5]
introduced the spin into relativity but  taking the square root of the Hamiltonian. As well as in the
Dirac equation the spin was obtained by linearizing the Hamiltonian of special relativity, in [4] spin
matrices were obtained by linearizing not the Hamiltonian of relativity but rather the space-metric
itself,  and  this  result    provided  the  conclusion  in  [4]  that  the  spin  is  intrinsically  linked  to  the
geometrical properties of space-time. Such  results  indicate that  the so called spin  must be really
intended as manifestation of a general and universal entity having in Nature an articulated, physical,
informative,  and  logic  role.  Other  interesting  evidences  of  such  a  conclusion  may  be  reached
through investigation in biology and physiology. Two authors, Hu. Hu and M. Wu, [6], introduced a
theory in which the advent of consciousness is intrinsically connected to spin. They  formulated a
spin-mediated  consciousness  theory  based  on  pan-protopsychism.  These  authors  were  able  to
discuss a well defined neurophysiological model to support their thesis. Considering the structure
and the dynamics of the brain, they postulated that the human mind works as follows: The nuclear
spin  ensembles  (NSE)  in  both  neural  membranes  and  proteins  quantum  mechanically  process
consciousness-related  information  such  that  conscious  experience  emerges  from  the  collapses  of
entangled quantum states of NSE under the influence of the underlying spacetime dynamics. Said
information is communicated to NSE through strong spin-spin couplings by biologically available
unpaired  electronic  spins  such  as  those  carried  by  rapidly  diffusing  oxygen  molecules  and  neural
transmitter nitric oxides that extract information from their diffusing pathways in the brain. In turn,
the dynamics of NSE has effects through spin chemistry on the classical  neural  activities  such  as
action potentials and receptor functions thus influencing the classical neural networks of brain [6]
The authors also gave some supporting evidence to such a formulation introducing indications for
experimental verifications.
Also recently, [7], we have given direct formulation for a possible quantum mechanical model of
consciousness based on the central role of the spin.

There is still another important reason to discuss here the real role of spin in biological dynamics.

The four bases in RNA sequences C, G, A and U ( or T in DNA) may be formalized by using Pauli
matrices. Note that we do not speak here of some physical feature of such molecules but of their
intrinsic representation and description. Of course, the four bases of RNA (or DNA) pertain to the
most  universal  language  and  description  of  our  biological  reality.  Let  us  explain  it  .Bases  of  the
same heterocyclic kind (purine or pyrimidine) have the same signs .A proper reference frame may
be  introduced  which  slides  along  the  RNA  chain  from 
'3   end.  Let  the  j-th  and  k-th
nucleotides be paired. The base pair

↓C , once
since AU and UA, CG and GC, are no longer identical. 
again, may be represented by Pauli matrices that in physics are representative of the spin but here
represent  base-pair values and  still the base-pair creation and base-pair disruption. These results
were obtained by Y. Magarshak [8]. We retain that they confirm fully our thesis. The notion of spin
must be intended according to  a very general meaning, that one of an entity that is articulated at a
physical but also informative, and logic level until as  a proto quantum like potential entity, whose
great importance may be identified in biological as well as in physiological studies.
Let us consider still another important result that also legitimates the reason to consider the role of
spin  on  a  more  general  plane.  Chaotic  behaviors  have  been  identified  in  a  consistent  number  of
signals pertaining to physiology and biology [9]. Starting with 1999, A. Jadczyk and R. Olkiewicz
[10]  showed that simultaneous measurements of  non commuting spin components lead to a chaotic
jump on a quantum spin sphere and to generation of  specific fractal images on the basis of a non

linear iterated function system. Thus, once again, non commutativity, as just was outlined also by
M. Zak in a previous work [11], and spin may be  also responsible of chaotic behaviors.
 Several  authors,  [6,12]  repeatedly  evidenced  that  the  spin  is  the  essence  of  quantum  mechanics
having an ontological meaning. Hu and Wu repeatedly outlined that  the driving  force behind the
evolution of Shrödinger equation is quantum spin and, since quantum entanglement arises from the
evolution of Shrödinger equation the said spin is the genuine cause of quantum entanglement. To
support this thesis we outline that recently we showed that Schrödinger equation is a manifestation
of an abstract algebraic  formulation in which the basic  elements are  given  as well as in the Pauli
spin formulation [13]. Quantum potentialities arise through  quantum superposition principle that is
admitted in Scrödinger equation.

4. On the Possibility to Introduce an Algebraic Structure as Quantum Like Scheme of Our
Reality.
The  conclusion of the previous section is that with the term  spin we should intend an entity that
seems  to  assume  a  general    role  in  our  reality    for  the  variety  of  the  dynamics  that  it  is  able  to
support  and  for the high differentiation of the processes to which it is able to oversee. We aim to
give a reason for such an entity to oversee  the natural phenomena at different levels. The reason
could be that the so called spin as admitted in physics  is really expression of a more general and
differentiated essence and modality of self-fulfilment of reality at its various levels of manifestation.
The confirmation could arise under a mathematical profile. It is known that on October 16 of 1843,
a  mathematician,  Sir  W.R.  Hamilton,  discovered    hypercomplex  numbers  [14]  that  he  initially
identified as the algebra of pure time.  The scientific community acknowledged lukewarmly such a
new mathematical discovery . J.T. Graves stated “I  have not  yet any  clear views on the  extent  to
which we are at liberty to arbitrarily create new imaginaries and to endow them with supernatural
th19  century W.M. Clifford [15] completed the work
properties”-such as non commutativity. In the 
initiated by Grassman and Hamilton giving a complete formulation of such algebraic structures. A
rather  trivial  but  interesting    feature    is  that  the  Hamilton  algebra  may  be  also  represented  by
matrices    and  in  this  case  we    re-find  Pauli  matrices  and  the  non  commutativity  of  the  basic
generators  of  the  algebra  in  the  same  manner  in  which  they  appear  in  quantum  theory  of  spin.
Therefore  ,  the  reason    for  what  we  have  previously  called  the  universality  of  spin  could  be
explained in the fact that its mathematical counterpart regards an algebraic structure, and  algebraic
structures  arise  in  the  description  of  natural  processes  and  they  have  universal  character.  If  we
identify the spin Pauli matrices of physics in the inner  body of an algebraic structure, in some sense
we  may  attempt  to  show  that    such  a  structure  represents  a  rough  scheme  of  quantum  like
mechanics. If so, the universality of the algebraic structure should draw directly on the possibility to
retain the same quantum like expressed theory as not specialized only at the quantum microphysical
level for which it was introduced in 1927.  In this  manner we return to consider the problem of the
potentiality and actuality that constitutes the basic aim of the present paper. As outlined in the first
section,  quantum  mechanics  exhibits  two  basic  and  original  features.  The  first  is  that  it  admits
potential  as  well  as  actualized  states  of  physical  reality.  The  second  point  is  that  it  admits  that,
under  suitable  circumstances,  we  have  a  stochastic  transition  from  potentiality  to  actualization  of
states  via  the  so  called  unknown  mechanism  of  the  wave  function  reduction  or  psi  collapse.  In
substance, if such a strong link exists between the given algebraic structure and a rough scheme of
quantum mechanics, we must re-find in the algebra the results of quantum mechanics. First of all
we  have  to  delineate  in  detail  the  basic  features  of  such  an  algebraic  structure,  discussing  in
particular its basic assumptions and the manner in which this algebra  may derived on the basis of
its  starting  axiomatic  points.  Shown  that    the  introduced  algebraic  structure,  represents  actually  a
quantum like scheme of quantum mechanics, we may attempt to take a great step forward and this is
to  say  to  give  for  a  first  time  a  rigorous  mathematical  proof  of  the  transition  from  potentiality  to
actualization that represents the basic indemonstrable fixed focus of all the quantum mechanics. We
could be entirely successful since the algebraic structure that we will use  could represent  a more

general  ontological  construction  respect  to  a  more  restricted  realization  that  could  be  represented
from traditional quantum theory. These are the objectives that are reached in the following section.
Here we will utilize the great work that, starting with 1981, was developed by  Y. Ilamed and N.
Salingaros  [16].  We  will  follow    the  same  technique  that  these  authors  used  in  their  work.  We
anticipate  here  that  only    two  basic    assumptions,  quoted  as  (a)  and  (b)  in  the  following  section,
seem that are required in order to formulate a rough scheme of quantum mechanics.

5. The Proof of Some Theorems.
In this section we  give a rigorous proof of theorems characterizing the algebra that we employ. We
will follow some basic results that were previously given by Y. Ilamed and N. Salingaros [16] in
1981, when these authors studied in detail the algebra with three anticommuting elements.
Let  us  consider  three  abstract  basic  elements,

The content of theorem 1. is thus established: given three abstract basic elements as defined in (a)
and (b), an algebraic structure is established with four generators (
Note that the (11) represents one of the most basic relations in quantum mechanics. It has been here
derived only on the basis of two algebraic assumptions, given respectively in (a) and (b).
We may now add some comments to the previous formulation.
The activity of scientific knowledge in two hundred years of development unequivocally shows that
some algebraic structures arise naturally in the description of natural entities and phenomena. Thus,
it is quite natural to attempt to identify the phenomenological counterpart of the  algebraic structure
given in (11). From (1) we have that

Let  us  observe    that  the    (14)  may  be  considered  to  represent  a  general  principle  of  ontic
potentialities  and,  in  particular,  it  indicates  that  we  never  can  attribute  simultaneously    definite
numerical values to two basic elements 
ie  . In conclusion, as seen by the axioms (a) and (b), by the
(11), by the (13) and the (14), we have delineated a rough scheme of quantum like theory through
an algebraic structure. In this algebraic scheme some principles of the basic theoretical framework
result to be represented.

These  principles are that the given algebraic structure reflects an intrinsic  indetermination  and an
ontic  potentiality  for  its  abstract  elements.  This  means  that,  in  absence  of  a  direct  numerical
attribution,  such  basic  elements  are  symbols  that  act  in  the  algebra  as  such  symbols,  having  an
intrinsic indetermination and an ontic potentiality. This is to say that, in absence of attribution of a
given numerical value, the basic elements 
ie operate in the given algebraic structure preserving the
potentiality to assume a direct, possible, numerical value at any stage of the  algebraic operations. In

unequivocally shows that both 
Let  us  explain  this  last  point  in  detail.  The  algebraic  structure  given  in  (1),  (2),  and  (11)  admits

Similar relations hold in the case of 
given algebraic structure, with reference to the idempotent 
of  1+ while the (17) establishes that, with reference to 2
3e .
The  conclusion is very important. The conceptual counter part of the (16) and (17) is that we are in
presence of a self-referential process. On the basis of such self-referential  process, as given in (16)
and  in  (17),  this    algebraic  structure  is  able  to  attribute  a  precise  numerical  value  to  its  basic
elements. Each of the three basic elements  is able to make a transition from the condition of pure
potentiality to a condition of actuality, that is to say in mathematical terms from the pure symbolic
representation of the given abstract elements to that one of a real number. Let us remember that, on
the  basis  of  the  (14),  this  self-referential  process  may    regard  each  time  one  and  only  one  of  the
three  basic  elements.  In  brief,  for  the  first  time  we  are  analyzing  an  algebraic  structure  that
represents a rough quantum like scheme and that, at the same time, as repeatedly admitted also in
usual quantum mechanics, evidences, on the basis of a self-referential process, that it is  possible a
transition from potentiality to actualization as we discussed it in the first section of this paper.
Note also the importance of the (16) and the (17) from the view point of the logic. Through the self-
referential process given in (16) and (17), our algebra recovers two first principles of logic that are
the Principle of non-Contradiction and the Principle of the excluded Middle.
Obviously,  in  order  to  reach  a  rigorous  formulation  of  such  matter,  the  central  question  that
mathematically arises is that we must  give proof that it does exist and it may be carefully defined
an  algebraic structure  that  initially is given as by the  (1), (2), and (11)  and then it is characterized
by  the  numerical  attribution    to  one  of  its  basic  elements,    as  example  to 
3e ,    of  one    numerical
value, say of  1+  or of -1. The same conclusion holds if we consider a numerical attribution to  1e or
to

In other terms, if we attribute the numerical value of  1+ to 
3e  a new algebraic structure arises with
new  generators  whose  rules  are  given  in  (20)  instead  of  in  (11).  Therefore,  the  arising  central
problem is to proof the real existence of such new algebraic structure. Note that, in the case of the
starting algebraic structure we showed that it exists in the following manner

i =

In the present case, with

We arrive at the proof of  theorem 2: given the algebraic structure A, fixed as in the (1), (2), and
(11),  it  exists  an  algebraic  structure  B,  that  we  call  a  subalgebra  of  A,  with  basic  elements
(generators)  given  in  (22).To  proof,  consider  that  we  now  attribute  to 
3e the  numerical  value  of
1+ and  so  it  is  dismissed  from  the  basic  scheme  of  the  three  anticommuting  basic  elements.  It  is
now replaced by  i . Rewriting the (3) and performing calculations we arrive to the solutions of the

In this manner we have reached the central aim of the paper. Also if using an algebraic structure,
this is the first time in which we are  able  to  show  the  manner  in  which  it  is  realized  the  passage
from  potentiality  to  actualization  and  it  has  been  demonstrated  by  using  a  rigorous  formulation
based  on    two  mathematical  theorems.  Since,  as  previously  said,  the  counterpart  exists  in  natural
processes  of  the  algebraic  structures  arising  during  their  description,  we  expect  that  the  two
theorems demonstrate the passage from potentiality to actualization in our reality.

7. On the possibility for Quantum Ontic Potentiality to Explain a Central Role in the
Dynamics of Living Matter.
In the present version of this paper we would add to the  mathematical proof, given in the previous
two  sections,  a  deepening  on  the  central  role  that  quantum  ontic  potentialities  could  have  in  the
dynamics of the living matter. We will follow in detail an excellent paper that was recently written
by P.C.W. Davies [18]  on this subject. According to this author we start outlining that biological
systems must be essentially intended as information processors. It must be outlined here that ideas
similar to those given by P.C.W. Davies, were also introduced by A.Yu. Khrennikov [18] as well as
also  such  author  considered    the  notion  of  Transformers  of  Information  when  speaking  of  living
systems.  The  basic  key  here  is  that  if  we  reason  in  the  framework  of  a  classical  context,  the
biological molecules must be  intended as processors of  bits of information. This is   in a classical
physical  framework,  while  instead,  in  a  quantum  like  context,  biological  molecules  become
processors  of    qubits  of    information,  that  is  to  say    this  time  that  the    information  processing
becomes  direct  consequence  of    the  superposition  principle  of  quantum  mechanics  that,  as
previously discussed in detail, regulates ontic potential states in the dynamics of our reality.  To be
clear, it does not exist at all a proven verification that quantum mechanics operates at the level of
biological  matter  attending  such  theory  to  the  dynamics  of  the  biological  sphere  with  its

fundamental  and  ontological  features  as  in  particular  the  superpositions  and  thus  the  ontological
potentiality of states and the transition from potential to actualized states. However, repeating what
it was just evidenced in [18], quantum mechanics works in living matter in explaining, as example,
the shapes of biomolecules, the specificity of proteins or the templating functions of nucleic acids.
It  is  at  work  in  determining  diffusion  rates  or  membrane  properties  or  the  strengths  of  molecular
bounds,  all  results  that  of  course  result  so  determinant  in  understanding  basic  features  of  living
matter. It should be still a matter of a restricted epistemic vision to accept that  quantum mechanics
is  only matter of calculations at atomic, molecular and biomolecular levels at the biological level.
As  discussed    in  the  previous  sections,  and  as  it  has  been  evidenced  in  particular    through    the
theorem  2,  this  theoretical  elaboration  is  a  theoretical  body  that  includes  so  advanced  and  so
radically new principles and views on our reality as in particular all that in an ontic vision is linked
to  the  superposition of states, to  potentiality and  actualization and still to many other well known
features  that  render  this  theory  completely  new  and  radically  innovative  in  the  complex
phenomenology and ontology of the dynamics of the reality.  Therefore, the basic interest becomes
to ascertain if and how such features, so complex to be admitted at an ontic level of our reality, are
they at work in dynamics of the biological being.
There are many directions we may consider wit this perspective. The first , also indicated in [18], is
that  one  that  one  may  define  of  the  quantum  mutations.  In  the  framework  of  the  previously
considered quantum ontic potentialities, one evaluates that  the genetic code could be considered as
a quantum code in which the superposition of coding states would act leading to spontaneous errors
in base pairing. This idea may be dated back to the discovery by Crick and Watson of the structure
of  the  DNA  and  to  the  consequent  possibility  that  mutations  could  occur  as  result  of  quantum
fluctuations,  that  therefore  should  became  the  source  of  random  biological  information.  Here  the
quantum mechanism that may be advocated is that one of the quantum tunnelling that represents the
most  essential  and  also  the  most  surprising  process  of  all  quantum  mechanics.  Proton  tunnelling
could indeed alter the structure  of nucleotide bases leading to incorrect pair bonding. The basic key
here is that the  quantum tunnelling is the most evident example of ontic superposition of potential
states that we have in Nature. In analogy with  the (27) that we  introduced previously to represent a
quantum mechanical   two level  system, but remaining on the general plane of discussion, we have
in this last case that at any time the state of the particle may be described by a state function that is a
linear superposition of two potential states, one corresponding to the condition that the particle has
tunnelled and one corresponding instead to the condition that the particle still has not tunnelled. We
have that, still see also the (27),

The  (36)  represents  an  excellent  example  of  quantum  superposition  of  states.  The  clue  with
biological  dynamics  was  given  by  J.  McFadden  and  J.  Al-Khalili  [19].  These  authors  started
observing that the central assumption that mutations happen randomly has been challenged by the
process  called  adaptive  or  directed  mutation.  It  was  also  detected  experimentally  when  a  non-
fermeating  strain  of  Escheria  coli  was  plated  onto  rich  media  containing  lactose  [19].  In
experiments  performed  by  J.  Cairns  et  al.  [20]  ,papillae  of 
lac lactose  fermenting  mutants  arose
over  a  period  of  several  weeks  yet  mutations  that  did  not  confer  any  selective  advantage  did  not

frequencies in absence of lactose. Adaptive mutations were also observed in other experiments [21].
Adaptive  mutations  are  different  from    standard    mutations  since  they  occur  in  cell  that  are  not

dividing or dividing rarely, they are time dependent but not replication dependent, they appear only
after the cell is exposed to selective pressure [19]. In order to explain adaptive mutations, different
authors [22] proposed to consider that they could be generated by environment induced collapse of
the  wave  function  describing  DNA  in  a  superposition  of  mutational  states.  This  is  exactly  the
superposition of potential states and its actualization that in the previous section we have shown to
be possible  by the theorems 1, and 2. In [19] it  was investigated the possibility discussed in [22]
and  a  specific  model  of  mutational  process  involving  quantum  tunnelling  and  the  time  of
decoherence  were  specifically  introduced.  The  authors  considered  the  so  called  Lowdin  two  step
model  [23]  for  generation  of  mutations  initiated  by  the  proton  tunnelling  of  an  H-bonded  proton
between  adjacent  sites  within  base  pairs.  Considering  DNA  replication,  the  state  will  evolve  to
incorporate  both  the  correct  base  C  for  tunnelling  not  happened  and  the  incorrect  base  T  for
tunnelling  happened.  We  will  have  a  superposition  of  potential  states,  one  consisting  of  the
unmutated condition and the other consisting instead of the mutated condition. The daughter DNA
will be a superposition of potentialities, mutated and unmutated conditions:

Again here the basic importance of the theorem 2 is clearly evidenced. In biological matter forms of
potentialities coexist in order to give final forms of actualization.

that will actualize to a final form according to the theorem 2.
Quite  similar  is  the  important  chapter  on  enzyme  reactions.  Still  according  to  [18],  enzymes  are
catalyzing proteins during biochemical reactions. They give so high reactions rates that we cannot
expect  to  be  explained  in  the  framework  of  the  usual  catalytic  mechanics.  Also  here  quantum
tunnelling explains an essential role and this decisive role has been evidenced by a series of detailed
and important results [24]. Again here, the invoked tunnelling mechanism is expressed by the (36)
and  thus  also  in  this  relevant  field  of  biological  matter  the    importance  to  recall  the  concept  of
superposition  of  potentialities  and  then  of  actualization  in  biological  dynamics,  results  to  be
decisive as stated by theorem 2.
Another  way  to  consider  quantum  effects  is  in  the  sphere  of  the  nanostructures  [18].  The  proton
pump  has  the  role  to  maintain  the  appropriate  voltage  across  the  cell  membranes  [25].  These
structures  are  complex  enzymes  whose  operation  seems  to  be  described  by  quantum  one-
dimensional nanotubes. Also membranes are involved in very complex process. Here it is expected
that the quantization of nonlinear membrane vibrations in cells should exhibit quantum behaviours
as a Bose condensate [18].
Finally,  we  have  the  great  role  that  quantum  mechanics  could  hold  at  the  level  of  synaptic
transmission among neurons. Again Eccles and Beck, as well as J. Walker, [26], argued that neuron
firings  should  be  regulated  from  quantum  tunnelling,  as  in  the  (36),  and  J.  Walker,  in  particular,
gave theoretical results in accord also with the experimental data in relation to the  mepp
 of vesicle
release. Recently we formulated some models legitimating the same advent of consciousness [7,17]
on the basis of quantum tunnelling.
There  is  still  another  important  question  resulting  very  convincing  in  admitting  a  basic  role  of
quantum superposition principle and quantum like general scheme in dynamics of living matter. It
relates the genetic code. In section three we inferred   about  a quantum like scheme of DNA and
RNA  considering  the  results  of  Magarshak  [6]  and  identifying  base  pair  values  and  base-pair
construction and destruption by spin Pauli matrices. Again, we consider here that the origin of the
genetic  code  may  be  linked  to  quantum  information  processing.  It  has  been  outlined    by  Patel  in

f

2001 [27] that the nucleotide bases could be represented and remain in a superposition of quantum
states  for  the  time  necessary  to  participate  to  replication  process.  One  may  consider  that  the
universal  genetic  code  is  based  on  triplets  of  nucleotides  of  four  varieties  that  code  for  20  or  21
amino acids. In 1996 [27] L.K. Grover found an optimal quantum search algorithm  in the sphere of
quantum computing . Indicating by N the number of objects that can be distinguished by a number
of yes/no queries , this author found that

      and   
      and    

Note  that  this  is  the  result  of  quantum  algorithm.  This  is  to  say  that  it  does  not  use  classical
arguments as well as it does not use advanced quantum mechanics. It employs only the principle of
superposition of quantum states and of quantum interference. The algorithm starts in fact assuming
an  uniform  superposition  of  all  the  possible  states  corresponding  to  equal  probability  for  every
building block to be selected. Now , as stated in [26,18], the very convincing argument is that the
(39) admits just the following solutions:
4=N
1=Q
3=Q
N =
this is to say  that such quantum algorithm, based on the quantum  superposition  principles,  gives
actually as solution for the genetic code the triplets of four varieties of 20-21 amino acids. If not due
to  unexpected  trivial  coincidence,  this  is  a  result  that  clearly  evidences  the  presence  of  quantum
mechanics at the basis of living matter.
It may be now  also clear the reason because the reality of living matter would choice  to operate on
the  basis  of  quantum  processing  (qubit)  instead  of  classical  processing  (bit),  on  the  basis  of
superposition  of  ontic  quantum  potentialities  and  consequent  actualization  instead  of  concrete
actualizations only. The reason is in a kind of exaltation of its power of processing information in
addition  to  more  specific  ontologic  motivations.  Correctly  P.C.  W.  Davies  arranges  the  problem
[18]: the life and its origin are  in some sense a kind of search problem. The subset of living systems
is an extremely small fraction of the total space of complex systems. As example, the  fraction  of
peptide chains having biological relevance is exponentially very small respect to the whole set of all
the  possible  sequences.  Only  a  very  small  fraction  of  all  the  nucleotide  sequences  code  for  the
biological  function.  So  the  central  arising  question  is  the  following:  given  a  mixture  of  classical
molecular  building  blocks,  how  may  and,  as  P.  Davies  outlines  [18],  how  did  matter  to  find  the
appropriate and extremely improbable combination by change among all the possible combinations
and in a contained period of time? Any classical explanation shows that it would take a time much
longer than the age of the universe [18]. It is quantum mechanics to give the possibility to answer
correctly since it, according to theorem 2, runs about potentialities and actualization. Let us look at
the time evolution model that we roughly introduced in section two:
ψ
)(X
P

)X
P
At any stage of such supposed  evolution this  system processes simultaneously three information
ways, it drags three possible values of actualization respect to only one that should compete in the
classical case. Since quantum systems admit superposition of states , they  may  be hold  and  they
may  also  search  for  a  great  variety  of  alternatives  at  the  same  time.  As  currently  said,  they  may
explore and process information  in parallel instead of in series. In this manner such systems may
explore a vast array of alternatives simultaneously and at a more accentuated speed respect to the
traditional case. This is the reason because sequences of biological relevance may be found much
faster than one may have in a classical non quantum framework.
We would now to face the last argument. The fractal nature of many biological systems is receiving
considerable attention from some years. The basic feature of self-similarity has been identified in a
lot of cases as in spatial structures or in temporal fluctuations of many biological signals as well as
in ion channel kinetics, in fetal breathing, in human cognition, in neuron firings, in cardiovascular
system. As known, the greatest part of such biological systems exhibit fluctuations like 
noise.

A  number  of  different  mechanisms  have  been  proposed  in  order  to  explain  the  origin  of  such
behaviour in nature and in biological matter. It has been argued that this behaviour could be
f/1
merely  a  result  of  the  multiple  system  inputs  to  the  considered  system  [28].  Owing  to  the
behaviour could be due to
widespread  nature of 
the fact that the final output should be affected by many processes that act at different time scales
and  in  fact  it  has  been  shown  that  some  distributions  of  time  scales  lead  to  1/f  behaviour.
scaling  so  recurrently
Therefore,  this  could  be  the  origin  of  the  complex  fluctuations  and 
observed in biological systems. In brief, in many biological systems the output of a system may be
seen  as  the  result  of  different  semiautonomous  contributing  systems  operating  at  different  time
scales. A convincing example is that one of Heart Rate where regulation takes part by a beat-to-beat
contribution  deriving  from  the  autonomic  system.  Here  the  heart  rate  oscillations  experience  the
input of a great variety of distinct random processes over a great variety of  different time scales.
We have vagally- mediated random inputs with frequencies about ¼ sec. , baroreflex modulations at
frequencies about 1/10 sec plus modulations due to the hormonal  systems,  posture,  activity  level,
meals,  sleep-wake  cycle,  circadian  rhythm  and  still  other  contributions  acting  on  the  sinus  node
activity at different time scales. This is a model that explains 
behaviour. According to [28], the
output model may be written at any time step,  k , as

behaviour in the framework of a quantum  mechanical scheme. To show this, let us consider
f/1
first a classical scheme. Here the time  fluctuations of the signal are considered to be due  to a kind
of a random relaxation process that has a time constant  τ  and it may be easily shown that the power
spectral density goes following the general form

 or 
and  the classical behaviour 
In this case the probability for each input signal is expressed in the following manner
)t(P
and, as previously said, it corresponds to a perfect classical scheme. To proof this one may consider
each arriving input as the result of an intrinsically unstable system that at each time has  a definite
t >  in this
probability to be present or not to be present. Considering two times  1t  and  2t  with 
classical schema one has that

Since,  by  hypothesis,  the  probability  for  the  input  signal  to  be  present  depends  only  upon  time,
considering only statistically independent events, we have the (43) that in fact admits then the (43)
as  solution.  However,  if  we  substitute  our  starting  schema,  considering  instead  that  we  have  this
time  a  quantum  mechanical  mechanism  generating  the  input  instead  of  the  previously  admitted
classical  picture,  we  have  an  unstable  quantum  system  as  starting  case  and  thus  in  this  case    the
basic  role  of  the  superposition  of  the  states  (signal  present  and  signal  not  present)  must  be
essentially  recalled.  This  question  leads  as  consequence  that  we  no  more  may  adopt  the  (43)  as
probability.  In  this  quantum  case,  instead  of  the  (43),  we  have  the  following  expression  for

  behaviour of the power spectrum.
The important conclusion is therefore the following: also in the case of pure quantum mechanical
behaviour  of  power  spectrum  that  is  exhibited  from  the
contributions  we  find  again  the 
greatest variety of biological signals.
Finally, we have to mention  here one of the most important experiments that in our opinion have
been performed in the last few years on this field of research.
As we know, wave-particle duality relates a basic feature of quantum physical reality, in substance
it regards the fact that a quantum object may exhibit either wave or particle properties depending on
the experimental arrangement that we decide to use.
 R.  Feynmann  repeatedly  outlined  that  the  strangeness  of  quantum  mechanics  may  be  seen
analyzing  in detail all that happens in the simple and elegant arrangement that we usually call the
Two  Slit  Experiment.  However,  in  spite  of  its  strangeness,    the  wave-particle  duality  of  massive
objects is a true basic foundation of quantum physics. De Broglie’s wave hypothesis , formulated in
1923, was also confirmed experimentally for atoms and molecules, as  He  atoms and 
2H molecules,
starting with 1932  by  Estermann and Stern [29] by diffraction experiments. A renewed interest for
molecular interferometry started in 1994 in consequence of the first observation of interference for
2I by  Ramsey  and  Bordé  [30].  The  reason  to  indicate  here  such  experimental  results  is  that  we
retain  that  a  quantum  like  mechanics  is  also  too  much  involved  in  the  dynamics  of  biological
matter, and a very recent result, obtained in the framework of molecular interferometry, confirms
such  an  approach  to  matter.  In  a  paper  of  2003  the  research  group  directed  by  Zellinger  [31]
reported to have obtained for the first time the demonstration of the wave and thus quantum nature
of  massive  objects  as  biomacromolecules.  Such  quantum  effects  were  observed    for  the
tetraphenylporphyrin (TTP) and for the fluorinated fullerenes.The porphyrin structure is at the core
of many complexes regarding biological matter as in particular biomolecules representing the color
center in chlorophyll and in hemoglobin. On the other hand, the fluorofullerene is 
, thus it is
a  very  massive  object  having  1632  amu.  Dismissed  or  vanishing  quantum  effects  should  be
expected for such molecules. Instead such results indicate that the de Broglie wave nature of objects
seems that may be the matter of some a generalization  developing a possible role also at the so high
stage of the molecular scale. As discussed in the previous sections of the present paper, we retain
that quantum mechanics may be generalized in order to be   involved in the biological dynamics of
macromolecules,  and possibly to overcome  the limits of scale  at the  elementary  or  at  the  atomic
level  only  as  actually  it  was  in  the  initial  vision  of    founding  fathers  of  quantum  theory.  The
theorem  2  that    we  have  given  in  this  paper,  gives  direct  indication  of  the  importance  to  have
obtained  a  mathematical  proof  of  the  existence  of  potential  states  and  of  transition  potentiality-
actualization that represent the core of any quantum mechanical view on our reality.

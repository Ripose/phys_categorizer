Abstract 

In its normal mode of operation the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility uses a high 

charge (10-100 nC), short pulse (3-5 psec) drive bunch to excite high-gradient 

accelerating fields in various slow-wave structures.  To generate this bunch, we designed 

a 1.5 cell, L-band, rf photocathode gun with an emittance compensating solenoid to give 

optimal performance at high-charge; it has recently completed commissioning.  More 

recently, we have begun to investigate the possibility of using this gun in a high-

brightness, low-charge operating mode, with charge equal to approximately 1 nC, for 

high-precision measurements of wakefields.  Two related measurements are reported on 

in this paper: (1) measurements of the transverse beam envelope are compared to 

predictions from the beam dynamics code PARMELA;  and (2) investigations into the 

use of  a modified 3-screen emittance measurement method that uses a beam envelope 

model that includes both space-charge and emittance effects.  Both measurements were 

made for the 1 nC, 8 MeV beam in the drift region directly following the rf photocathode

1. Introduction 

 

The Argonne Wakefield Accelerator (AWA) facility [1] is used to investigate 

electron beam-driven, high-gradient wakefield acceleration techniques. The generation of 

high accelerating gradients (>100 MeV/m) in wakefield structures or plasmas requires a 

high charge (10-100 nC), short pulse (3-5 psec) electron drive bunch. While most rf 

photocathode gun designs are optimized for high-brightness, low-charge (~1 nC) 

applications, such as free electron lasers, the 1.5 cell, L-band AWA rf photocathode gun, 

or “Drive Gun,” is optimized for high-charge operation mode.  The high-brightness 

application we are pursuing is the development of a compact, high-precision wakefield 

measurement system for the purpose of characterizing slow-wave structures as described 

in the reference [2]. 

Recently, we have begun an investigation to determine if the high-charge AWA Drive 

Gun can also be operated in a high-brightness operation mode.  High-brightness rf 

photocathode guns routinely generate 1 nC beams with normalized transverse emittances 

in the neighborhood of 2 – 5 µm.  Since the Drive Gun had already been optimized for 

high-charge operation, we realized that it might not be possible to generate such high-

brightness beam with this gun.  However, recent simulations [2] performed with 

PARMELA [3] indicate that high-brightness operation is possible provided that a 

sufficiently high accelerating gradient (peak field on-axis =

E z

0 =

80

/
mMV

) in the gun 

can be reached.

In this paper, we present the results of experiments to characterize the AWA Drive 

Gun operating in the high-brightness, low-charge mode are presented.   Spot size 

measurements were made of the 8 MeV, 1 nC beam at 3 locations in the drift region 

downstream of the Drive Gun as the rf launch phase of the gun was varied from 

approximately 300 to 700.  These measurements were then analyzed in two different 

ways: (1) the spot sizes were compared to predictions from the beam dynamics code 

PARMELA; and (2) the spot sizes were used to investigate the capabilities of a modified 

3-screen emittance measurement method.  This modified method differs from the 

standard method in that its beam envelope model includes space-charge effects in 

addition to emittance effects, since it is well known that standard method fails for space-

charge dominated beams. The outline for the remainder of this paper is as follows.  We 

present: (i) the experimental setup and technique used to measure the beam envelope and 

emittance, (ii) the results of the experimental measurements; and (iii) a discussion of 

2. The Experimental Setup and Technique 

In this section, we first describe the experimental setup including the main 

components of the beamline where the spot size measurements were made, the Drive 

Gun, and the photocathode laser system; and second the experimental technique of the 

modified 3-screen emittance measurement method.

results.

In Figure 1, a highly simplified version of the AWA Gun Test Stand (GTS) beamline 

shows only the elements that were used during these measurements.  The block labeled 

“Gun & Solenoids” consist of the Drive Gun and three solenoids as described in detail 

below.  The two diagnostics elements used are: (1) a single Bergoz integrating current 

transformer (ICT) for nondestructive measurement of the beam charge; and (2) three 

YAG:Ce (YAG) phosphor screens for beam profile measurements (YAG-1, YAG-2, and 

YAG-3).  The YAG screens were mounted on pneumatic actuators, were purchased from 

Crytur Ltd., and have dimensions of 250 µm thick by 50 mm in diameter. 

THE RF PHOTOCATHODE GUN 

 

The AWA Drive Gun [1] is similar in design to the standard BNL/SLAC/UCLA rf 

photocathode gun with an emittance compensating solenoid.  The Drive Gun is an L-

band, 1.5 cell, rf photocathode gun operating in the π-mode at 1300 MHz and currently 

uses a Mg photocathode.  Power from a 30 MW L-band Klystron is side-coupled into the 

downstream full cell and then on-axis coupled into the upstream half cell.  Two 

solenoids, the bucking and the focusing solenoids, are placed symmetrically about the 

plane of the photocathode while a third solenoid, the matching solenoid, is located at the 

exit of the gun. The focusing and matching solenoids work together as the effective 

emittance compensating solenoid, while the bucking solenoid is used to buck out the 

magnetic field of the focusing solenoid at the cathode.  We have recently implemented a 

laser cleaning system and initial estimates show that the quantum efficiency was 

improved by about an order of magnitude. 

 

 

5 

The Drive Gun has been successfully conditioned and routinely generates electron 

bunches with charge up to 100 nC.  Using 13 MW of incident power, the gun is normally 

operated at 

E z

0 =

80

/
mMV

which generates a beam energy at the gun exit of about 8 

MeV.  The bucking and focusing solenoids are operated with on-axis peak magnetic flux 

density of 

Bz

92.0=

kG

 while the matching solenoid runs at 

5.4=

kG

.  Under these 

Bz

conditions, the emittance compensated minimum is located approximately 2.5 m 

downstream of the photocathode.   

THE AWA PHOTOCATHODE GUN LASER SYSTEM 

The AWA laser system consists of a Tsunami oscillator purchased from Spectra 

Physics and a TSA-50 chirped-pulse amplifier (CPA) from Positive Light.  The oscillator 

is a regenerative mode-locking Ti:Sapphire oscillator tuned to λ = 744 nm (∆λ = 9 nm, E 

= 7 nJ) output that is pumped by an all solid-state 5 W, cw, green laser (Millennia V).  

The oscillator runs at the 16th sub-harmonic (81.25 MHz) of the rf (1300 MHz) and is 

phase locked to within 1 psec (r.m.s. jitter) of the rf using the vendor’s Lok-to-Clock box.  

The CPA consists of a stretcher followed by a Ti:Sapphire regenerative amplifier (regen), 

two stages of linear Ti:sapphire amplifiers and a compressor.  After reducing the 

bandwidth with a mask in the stretcher, the seed pulse exits the stretcher with a pulse 

length of approximately  200  psec where it is optically switched into the regen with the 

injection Pockels Cell, at a repetition rate of 10 Hz.  The extraction Pockels Cell timing is 

adjusted to extract the most stable pulse from the regen and this pulse (E = 2.5 mJ) is then 

 

 

 

6 

further amplified by the two linear amplifiers to 35 mJ and directed into the compressor.  

Upon exiting the compressor the pulse energy is 20 mJ and the pulse length is 8 psec 

FWHM.  After exiting the CPA, this pulse is frequency tripled to λ = 248 nm and E = 1 - 

2 mJ, in the Tripler. 

Upon exiting the Tripler, the laser pulse passes through a variable telescope and is 

then transported by a series of mirrors into the accelerator tunnel to an adjustable iris, 

about 10 m after the Tripler.  The adjustable iris is located just outside the vacuum, about 

1 m away from the photocathode surface, and is used to control the spot size on the 

photocathode.  After the nearly parallel beam passes through the iris, it is sent through a 

UV-quality quartz window and strikes a mirror in the vacuum chamber and is directed at 

near normal incidence to the photocathode. 

THE MODIFIED 3-SCREEN EMITTANCE MEASUREMENT METHOD 

The standard 3-screen emittance measurement method is not adequate for measuring 

the emittance of the beam directly out of the Drive Gun due to the strong space-charge 

forces involved in the transport of the beam.  In the standard method, space-charge is 

implicitly ignored and one determines the three transverse phase space unknowns (the 

beam emittance (ε), the beam beta function (β), and the beam envelope slope (α)) from 

the 3 measured spot sizes (σ1, σ2, and σ3).   However, when the space-charge cannot be 

ignored, a modification to the standard method will be required.

factors.  The third term in Eq. 1 is called the emittance defocusing term while the fourth 

term is called the space-charge defocusing term.  If all three measurements of the beam 

size are made in a drift (as is the case for the measurements described in this paper) we 

can set κ0(s)=0 and the evolution of the beam envelope is determined solely by the 

emittance and space-charge terms.  If we define R as the ratio of the space-charge to the 

emittance terms we then have, 

R =

The standard 3-screen emittance measurement technique is used when the beam is 

emittance dominated; i.e. when this ratio is much less than one: R << 1.

According to PARMELA simulations of the AWA Drive Gun, a Q = 1 nC, Energy = 

8 MeV beam, will have: σx,y ~ 1-3 mm, εnorm ~ 1 µm, and I ~ 0.5 kAmp, which results in 

R ~ 20-150, clearly a space-charge dominated beam. Therefore, to extract the emittance 

from the spot size measurements we need to use a model of the beam envelope that 

includes both space-charge and emittance; there are several ways to do this.  In this 

paper, we will fit the beam envelope to the 3 spot size measurements with the 3D 

envelope code TRACE 3-D [5].  Since there are 4 unknowns in Eq. 1 (the initial spot 

size, 

( =sσ

)0

, and slope, 

( =′ sσ

)0

, the emittance ε and generalized perveance K ) one 

could imagine using a 4-screen emittance measurement technique to determine the 4 

unknowns.  However, as we discuss below, we chose to assume that K is given correctly 

from PARMELA simulations. 

3. Experimental Measurements and Emittance Estimates 

3.1 Data Acquisition and Data Reduction 

Beam images were acquired at 3 locations in the drift region following the gun, (Fig. 

1: YAG-1, YAG-2, and YAG-3) with Sony analog CCD cameras fitted with manually 

controlled 60-300 mm zoom lenses and captured by an 8-bit PC-based Imaging 

Technology frame grabber.  The zoom lenses were instrumented with a remotely 

controllable aperture to insure that the images were not saturated and yet made full use of 

the dynamic range of the imaging system.  A user developed Matlab routine was used to 

extract spot sizes (σx and σy) from each of the captured beam images using the following 

 

 

 

9 

procedure: (1) subtract off the dark current background from the image, and (2) fitting a 

Gaussian curve to the projected beam profile.  All spot sizes quoted in this paper are the 

‘1-sigma’ values of the fitted Gaussian.   

The spatial resolution of the acquired images was estimated as follows.  The 

horizontal resolution of the image was 11.6 pixels/mm while the vertical resolution was 

about 8.1 pixels/mm.  (The difference in resolution for the two directions is due to the 

fact that the YAG screens are tilted at 450 which caused the horizontal axis to become 

elongated by  2 .)  In units of distance, and assuming we need a least 2 pixels to detect a 

change in spot size, then the horizontal resolution is = (2 pixels)/(11.6 pixels/mm) = 0.09 

mm and the vertical resolution is 1/8.1 = 0.12 mm.  (For simplicity of data analysis we 

use 0.1 mm in both directions.)  Since we need at least 10 pixels per 1-sigma of a 

Gaussian beam to resolve the spot [6], this means that the minimum 1-sigma spot size 

that can be resolved in the horizontal is 10/11.6 = 0.86 mm and in the vertical direction is 

10/8.6 = 1.2 mm.   

During the experiment, we attempted to hold all experimental parameters fixed except 

for the rf gun phase, φgun, as shown in Table 1.  However, due to the inherent shot-to-shot 

jitter of the laser energy amplitude, the nominal charge, 

Q 1=

nC

, was expected to 

fluctuate during the data taking process.  And since charge jitter causes the spot size to 

jitter, data analysis becomes difficult.  On the other hand, we expect that beam charge and 

spot size to be closely correlated, assuming the other parameters remain fixed.  Therefore, 

rather than acquiring a large number of images and averaging the results, we 

 

 

10 

implemented a method for synchronized capturing of the beam image (as measured at the 

phosphor screens in Fig. 1: YAG-1, YAG-2, and YAG-3), and the value of charge (Fig. 

1.: ICT).  Since the other parameters can be held constant rather easily, the synchronized 

data taking procedure was expected to greatly reduce the measured spot size fluctuation 

due to laser amplitude jitter.  

 

After setting the parameters to the values shown in Table 1, data was acquired by the 

following procedure.  (i) Make a quick sweep of the rf gun phase to determine the well 

understood charge vs. rf gun phase (Q vs. φgun) curve.  From this curve, the approximate 

location of the zero phase point, 00, is found since it is the approximately the lowest 

phase point at which the extracted charge from the gun drops to zero.  Once the zero 

phase point is found, increase φgun to approximately 300;   (ii) Insert YAG-1 into the 

beamline; (iii) Over approximately the next 20 shots of the machine, acquire the video 

image at YAG-1, the charge at ICT, and the relative intensity of the laser pulse (measured 

at the exit of the laser Tripler); (iv) Repeat steps (ii) and (iii) for the other phosphor 

screens (YAG-2 and YAG-3) with the same rf gun phase; (v) increase φgun by 100 and 

repeat steps (i) – (iv).  In summary, we measured the spot sizes at YAG-1, YAG-2, and 

YAG-3 for the rf gun phases φEXPT ≅ 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700.  It should also be 

emphasized that the solenoids used for emittance compensation were not adjusted during 

this entire run which means that the optimal (i.e. very low) emittances were not obtained 

since the beam is not, in general, emittance compensated. 

 

11 

A typical data set (20 machine pulses acquired) of the spot size vs. charge is shown in 

Figure 2.  Although our goal was to measure the spot size at Q = 1 nC, in general, there 

were no events at precisely Q = 1 nC and some fitting is required.  Due to laser amplitude 

jitter as discussed above, we observed a large variation in the beam charge over the entire 

range of data, from Qmin = 0.8 nC to Qmax = 1.6 nC, as well a large variation in the 1-

sigma Gaussian fitted spot size measured at YAG-1, from σmin = 1.7 mm to σmax = 2.7 

mm.  Taken as they are, these large variations make data interpretation difficult.  

However, this variation can be reduced by using only spot sizes in a narrow charge 

window surrounding Q = 1 nC (Fig. 2a. 0.95 nC < Q < 1.05 nC).  For this window, we 

obtained a significant reduction in the peak-to-peak spot size fluctuations, ∆σp-p = 0.4 

mm.  However, note that it is also possible to choose a narrow charge window that still 

contains large spot size fluctuations (Fig. 2b).  So, although the windowed data usually 

gave a marked improvement over the non-windowed data, the remaining variation in the 

spot size is not fully understood at present but investigations are underway. 

In addition to the complication of spot size fluctuations, there were usually not 

enough data points in the window (e.g. there are only 3 data points in the charge window 

shown in Fig. 2a) to reliably obtain a mean. Therefore, a linear fit to the data was made 

(solid line in Fig. 2) and the value for the spot size was interpolated at Q = 1 nC.  In the 

case of Fig. 2, the spot size obtained at Q = 1 nC was σx = 1.97 mm.  The measured 

horizontal and vertical spot sizes (using the above procedure for the data reduction) for 

the 3 different YAG screens and the 5 different phases are shown in Figure 3.   

 

 

12 

3.2 Comparison of the Measured Spot Sizes to the PARMELA Beam Envelope. 

In this section, we compare the measured spot sizes to PARMELA predictions of the 

beam size at the 3 YAG screens shown in Figure 1 using the machine and beam 

parameters listed in Table 1.  Since the precise value of the rf gun phase is not known 

during the experiment, the approximate values of the rf gun phases listed section 3.1 are 

replaced with fitted values in this section.  The fit was done by adjusting the rf gun phase 

in the PARMELA simulation until the envelope most closely matched the φEXPT ≅ 300 

data points. The fit resulted in a small adjustment of 20 of rf phase so that the set of 

phases quoted above (300 to 700 ) are now replaced with the set (280 to 680).  

Measured spot sizes and the PARMELA beam envelope are in reasonably good 

agreement in the drift region after the gun.   For instance, by inspection of Figure 6a, one 

can see that the PARMELA beam envelope for φPARM = 280 passes very closely to the 

three σX data points for φEXPT = 280 (square symbols).  However, a careful inspection of 

data in Figure 6 reveals two systematic anomalies with the spots measured at YAG-1 (z = 

102 cm).  First, the ratio of σY to σX at the three screen locations have the average values 

of σY/σX = 1.16, 1.02, and 1.00, respectively.  This means that while the spots measured 

at YAG-2 and YAG-3 are essentially round, the spot measured at YAG-1 is elliptical.  

The second anomaly is that the spot size measured at YAG-1 is systematically larger than 

the predicted PARMELA envelope in both the horizontal and vertical plane, while it is 

within a few percent at YAG-2 and YAG-3.  On average, the measured value of σX at 

YAG-1 is 16% higher than the predicted PARMELA beam envelope while the measured 

 

 

13 

value for σY is 34% higher.  Both of the systematic errors just described are believed to 

be caused by the large dark-current background present at YAG-1 due to its close 

proximity to the Drive Gun.  On the contrary, images captured at YAG-2 and YAG-3 

have almost zero dark-current background, since they are located farther downstream, 

and thus it is easier to obtain an accurate spot size measurement.  In the future, the 

problem due to dark-current encountered at YAG-1 could be abated by using an OTR 

(optical transition radiation) screen and a gated camera to effectively gate out the dark 

current. 

 

 

3.3 TRACE 3-D fit to the Data 

In this section, we use the 3D beam envelope code, TRACE 3-D, to fit a beam 

envelope to the spot sizes for the 5 different rf gun phases (Fig. 3) in order estimate the 

emittance.  In the fit, the transverse phase space parameters in the horizontal (αx, β x, and 

ε x) and vertical (αy, β y, and ε y) directions are varied to obtain a best fit of the envelope 

to the data for each plane.  The longitudinal parameters (bunch length, energy, and 

energy spread) are taken from the PARMELA simulations and used as inputs to TRACE 

3-D.  This is acceptable for two reasons: (i) previous measurements of the longitudinal 

parameters have been found to be in reasonable agreement with PARMELA predictions; 

and (ii) the transverse parameters are only weakly dependent on the longitudinal 

parameters in our range of interest.  An additional simplification used in the fit is that 

TRACE 3-D only tracks the overall beam envelope, and not individual longitudinal 

slices, and therefore doesn’t correctly model the evolution of the projected emittance.  

14 

Lastly, the longitudinal parameters are approximated to be constant and equal to the 

averaged values of the PARMELA output in the drift region between YAG-1 at z = 102 

cm and YAG-3 at z = 375 cm.  Since the simulations show that the longitudinal 

parameters only varied by a few percent in this interval a good fit is expected. 

The beam envelope is fitted to the data in the following manner.  If σi are the 

measured spot sizes and Ti are the TRACE 3-D fitted spot sizes at the three YAG screens, 

then χ2 is defined as the sum of the square of the residuals, 

2
χ

=

∑ =

i

(
i Tσ
−

)

.  

Normally, a best fit to the data is obtained by varying the three phase space unknowns {ε, 

β, α} in TRACE 3-D until χ2 is minimized, and this is essentially our approach.  

However, it is more meaningful to find two sets of parameters (ε, β, α) that both pass 

within the error bars of the data in order to obtain a lower and an upper estimate of 

emittance.   

 

 As a representative example of the quality of the TRACE 3-D fit to the data, we 

examine the fit to the horizontal (x) data for φgun = 280 in some detail (Fig. 5).  The error 

bars on the spot size measurements come from two factors, the resolution of the video 

system (which was shown to be +/- 0.1 mm in Section 3.1) and the spot size uncertainty 

due to shot-to-shot fluctuations of the spot size (i.e. spot size jitter) as shown in Figure 

2b.  This later fluctuation is difficult to estimate given the limited number of data points, 

but the typical standard deviation of the spot sizes over the full charge range was 

approximately 0.3 mm.  Therefore, adding these errors in quadruture gives the total error 

bars as approximately +/-0.3 mm (Fig 5: note that the origin has been shifted so that 

 

15 

YAG-1 is located a z = 0 cm.) As can be seen from the figure, there is a large emittance 

range that fits the data for the case at φgun = 280. These fit results mean that the 

normalized emittance is bounded between 1 µm and 13 µm for this case. 

The range of the normalized r.m.s. emittance for all 5 values of the rf phase and for 

both the horizontal and vertical planes is shown in Figure 6.  Although the fit is 

technically consistent with the PARMELA prediction, its emittance resolution was poor; 

i.e. the quality of the emittance fit is poor since it only estimates the emittance to about an 

order of magnitude.  A full explanation of why the emittance was not more tightly 

bounded is given in the next section, but is basically due to the fact that the beam is 

emittance dominated, i.e. a large value of R (Eq. 2) in the drift region.   

4. Discussion of Results 

Overall, agreement between the model predictions and the measured values were of 

mixed quality.  On the positive, the measured beam spot sizes were in good agreement 

with the predicted values from PARMELA, except at YAG-1 where the dark-current 

background limited the resolution of the measurement.  However, the modified 3-screen 

emittance measurement method used in this paper proved unsatisfactory since its 

emittance resolution was poor.  This result seems surprising at first since the envelope 

equation upon which TRACE 3-D is based includes both space-charge and emittance 

effects and was therefore expected to be useful in constraining the beam emittance.  

However, the reason that the 3-screen technique failed was due to a combination of the 

 

 

 

16 

large space-charge dominated ratio of the beam, R, and the accuracy with which we can 

measure the spot sizes at YAG-1, YAG-2, and YAG-3.  A sensitive measurement of the 

emittance should do two things: (i) produce a large change in the measured variable (spot 

size in the 3-screen case) for a small change in emittance; and (ii) be able to measure the 

variable (spot size) with high precision.  But for the 3-screen measurement, in the case of 

a heavily space-charge dominated beam, even large changes in emittance (e.g. a factor of 

2) did little to change the beam envelope (or spot size), as can be seen from Figure 5.  For 

example, when R = 300, as is typical for the beams measured in these experiments, then 

the space-charge force is 300 times stronger than the emittance force.  In other words, the 

evolution of the beam envelope is almost totally uninfluenced by the low value of the 

emittance.  According to Eq. 2, the emittance would need to increase by a factor of  300  

(or ~17) to reduce R to near 1 and emittance effects could be easily measured.   

With the above explanation of the importance of R in mind, we can now understand 

the variation of the emittance fit vs. phase shown in Figure 6.  Inspection of Figure 6 

reveals that the normalized emittance is more tightly bound at the lowest (280) and 

highest (680) values of the rf gun phase compared to the rf phase near the center (480).  

This is due to the variation of the space-charge ratio, R, for each of the different rf phases, 

as is shown for two representative examples in Figure 7.  At φgun = 280, the space-charge 

ratio R has an average value of about 250 in the interval between YAG-1 and YAG-3, 

while at φgun = 480 this average value of R is about 1000.  From the above discussion, we 

know that the more heavily space-charge dominated a beam is, the less precision with 

which we can constrain the emittance.  Therefore, since the space-charge ratio R is larger 

 

17 

at φgun = 480 than at φgun = 280 we expect that the 3-screen measurement to be less precise 

at φgun = 480 and this is exactly what was observed (Fig. 6). 

5. Conclusion 

Two related measurements are reported on in this paper: (1) are compared to predictions 

from the beam dynamics code PARMELA;  and (2) that uses a beam envelope model that 

includes both space-charge and emittance effects.  Both measurements were made for the 

1 nC, 8 MeV beam in the drift region directly following the rf photocathode gun.   

Beam dynamics studies were made for the space-charge dominated beam produced 

by the 1.5 cell, rf photocathode gun at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility. 

Measurements of the transverse beam envelope were made in the drift region located 

between 102 cm and 375 cm after the photocathode plane, for a beam with charge of 1 

nC, energy of 8 MeV, and a bunch length of 0.8 mm.  The measurements of the beam 

envelope in the drift were in reasonably good agreement with the PARMELA 

predictions. Investigations into the use of  a modified 3-screen emittance measurement 

method using a model that includes both space-charge and emittance effects were made.  

However, because the beam was so heavily space-charge dominated (R>200) this 

technique did not have sufficient emittance resolution to constrain the emittance to within 

a useful range.  However, the modified 3-screen technique is still useful for measuring 

the emittance of a beam that is not so space-charge dominated, say when R < 10.  In the 

future, we plan to measure the emittance of this beam using both a standard pepper pot 

technique and an ODR-OTR based technique [7].

Fig. 1.  A simplified diagram of the AWA Gun Test Stand beamline.  Charge is measured 

by the ICT and beam images are measured by inserting the phosphor screens YAG-1, 

YAG-2, or YAG-3. (

0=z

 is the location of the photocathode; all distances are in cm) 

Fig. 2. Spot size vs. charge measurements for a typical data event.  (a) small fluctuations 

in spot size are obtained for the charge window between Q = 0.95 and 1.05 nC while (b) 

large fluctuations in the spot size for a different charge window between Q = 1.24 and 

1.34 nC 

Fig. 3. Spot size measurements made at the three YAG screens for Q = 1 nC for the 5 

different rf gun phases used during the experiment (φEXPT). (a) σX and (b) σY are the 1-

sigma fitted Gaussian spot sizes in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively.  

Note, the lines are only used as a visual guide to connect spots measured at the same 

phase and are not meant to be representative of the beam envelope.  Also note that the 

solenoids were set to a constant value (Table 1) during the rf phase sweep and thus the 

emittances are not, in general, compensated. 

Fig. 4. Comparison of the PARMELA beam envelope (solid lines) and the measured spot 

sizes (symbols) shows relatively good agreement.

Fig. 5.  Typical fit of the TRACE 3-D envelope (solid lines) to the σX spot size data 

(square symbols with error bars) for the particular value of φgun =280 (Fig. 3). This fit 

shows that when TRACE 3-D is used with a normalized emittance value of either 1 µm 

or 13 µm the beam envelope is consistent with the measured spot sizes, when the error 

bars are included. 

Fig. 6.  The normalized r.m.s. emittance for the 5 different values of the rf gun phase: (a) 

horizontal and (b) vertical.  Measured emittance shown as vertical bars. PARMELA 

predicted emittances (εX = εY) shown as diamonds.  Note that the solenoids were set to a 

constant value (Table 1) during the phase sweep and thus the emittances are not, in 

general, compensated. 

 
 
Fig. 7.  PARMELA output values for the emittance (ε), the beam envelope (σ), and the 

space charge ratio divided by 100 (R/100) along the entire length of the AWA GTS 

beamline, from the photocathode at z = 0 to slightly beyond YAG-3.  In the interval 

between YAG-1 and YAG-3 we see the beam at φ = 280 is less space charge dominated 

than the one at φ = 480.

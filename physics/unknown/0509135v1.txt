Abstract

Hylleraas in 1929 carried out a variational computation on the Schr¨o-
dinger equation for the helium atom which gave, for the ﬁrst time,
a ground-state energy in essential agreement with experimental re-
sults. Coolidge and James in 1933, likewise did the ﬁrst accurate
computation for the hydrogen molecule (H2). These are considered
epoch-making contributions in the development of ab initio quantum
chemistry, since they provided deﬁnitive evidence for the validity of
the multiple-particle Schr¨odinger equation for atoms and molecules.
Before then, exact solutions had been obtained only for one-electron
hydrogenlike atoms. The helium and hydrogen work was done long be-
fore the advent of electronic computers and required many months of
drudgery, using hand-cranked calculating machines. Nowadays, stu-
dents of chemistry and physics can carry out these same computations
in a matter of hours, or even minutes, using relatively straightforward
Mathematica routines. Moreover, the results can be easily improved
far beyond the capabilities of the original workers.

Introduction

Neils Bohr’s model of the atom, published in 1913, introduced the concept
of electrons orbiting an atomic nucleus in a set of quantized energies. The
characteristic line spectra of atoms could then be associated emission and
absorption of electromagnetic radiation in transitions between these discrete
orbits. With later elaborations by Sommerfeld and Stoner, Bohr recognized
that sequential ﬁlling of the allowed electron orbits could qualitatively ac-
count for the periodic structure of the elements. However the Bohr model was

1

quantitatively successful only for one-electron systems—the hydrogen atom
and hydrogenlike ions such as He+, Li2+, etc. Attempts to generalize the
dynamics of electron orbits failed miserably even for the two-electron helium
atom. Attempted applications to molecules, with more than one nucleus,
were even worse.

Classical concepts such as electron orbits were superseded by the de-
velopment of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg, Schr¨odinger and Dirac in
1925-26. The form of quantum mechanics most suitable for the treatment of
atoms and molecule was wave mechanics, based on the Schr¨odinger equation,
a partial diﬀerential eigenvalue equation in the symbolic form

Hψ = Eψ

(1)

which could be explicitly written down for any atom or molecule. Here H
represents the Hamiltonian operator, E is an allowed energy of the quan-
tum system and ψ
is the wavefunction, a more realistic reprresentation of
electrons as wavelike entities rather than orbiting particles. Schr¨odinger, in
his original 1926 paper gave an exact solution for the hydrogen atom, in
numerical agreement with Bohr’s results for the allowed energy levels. The
next step was to discover whether the Schr¨odinger equation could provide a
correct description for multiple-electron atoms and for molecules. It became
evident very soon that exact analytic solutions for the Schr¨odinger equation
could not be obtained for any system more complicated than hydrogen atom.
However, the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method could be applied to obtain
approximate solutions to the Schr¨odinger equation in conformity with the
inequality

E0 ≤ R

ψ ∗ H ψ ∂τ
2 dτ
|

(2)

|
where E0 is the exact ground-state energy of the system. The game now
R
evolved into constructing approximate wavefunctions which approched the
experimental values of E0, most commonly determined from spectroscopic
data. An up-to-date account of the relevant quantum-mechanical background
is given my recent text[1].

in terms of atomic units, ¯h = me = e = 1. An inﬁnite nuclear mass is
assumed and relativistic and radiative corrections are neglected. For helium
atom, the nuclear charge Z = 2. The energy is expressed in hartrees: 1
hartree = 27.211 electron volts. The ﬁrst ionization energy for helium is
experimentally 24.59 eV, while the second ionization energy is 54.42 eV. The
last result is implied by the exact energy of the hydrogenlike He+ ion, equal
54.42 eV. Therefore the experimental ground-state
to =
2.90372 hartrees. The
energy of helium atom is given by E0 =

analysis.

In the most elementary picture, the ground state of the helium atom
can be described as a 1s2 electron conﬁguration, meaning that both elec-
trons occupy hydrogenlike 1s atomic orbitals. The ﬁrst approximation to
the wavefunction is therefore given by

ψ (r1, r2)

with

Z = 2

The variational principle Eq (2) then given an approximate energy of
hartrees, certainly in the right ball park but quantitatively inferior. A fairly
easy improvement is to replace the actual nuclear charge Z by an eﬀective
value ζ, which minimizes the variational integral. The optimal result is ob-
tained with ζ = 27/16 = 1.6875, giving a much improved ground-state energy
of
2.84765, within about 2% of the experimental value, but still not an air-
tight proof of concept. The value of ζ < Z can be attributed to the partial

shielding of the nuclear charge experienced by each electron, caused by the
presence of the other electron.

This is where the Norwegian physicist E. A. Hylleraas[2, 3] enters the

picture. Hylleraas deﬁned new independent variables

s = r1 + r2,

t = r1 −
The wavefunction is then approximated as a linear combination containing
integer powers of s, t and u which we can write

Once the matrix elements and the secular determinant are deﬁned, the
lowest root can be found in about 30 seconds using Mathematica 5.0 on a
dual-processor Macintosh G5. The optimal value ζ = 1.75 can be found
from a few trial runs. The Mathematica notebook for the computation is
appended.

The helium ground-state energy is computed to be ε =

2.90360 hartrees,
in essential agreement with the best experimental value at the time. Sub-
sequent theoretical work has determined that a more accurate wavefunc-
tion must be augmented by terms containing negative powers of s and aug-
mented by factors of ln s. The deﬁnitive computation by Pekaris[4], using
a 1078-term recursion formula, gave a nonrelativistic ground-state energy
ε =

2.903724375 hartrees,

In 1933, Coolidge and James[5, 6] at Harvard carried out the ﬁrst deﬁni-
tive ab initio computation on the H2 molecule. The symmetry of a diatomic
molecule can be exploited by using prolate spheroidal coodinates λ, µ, ϕ,

angular momentum components along the internuclear axis vanish, and the
wavefunction is cylindrically-symmetrical. Wavefunctions can be constructed
as functions of ﬁve dimensionless variables:

It is suﬃcient for present purposes to describe a scaled-down version of
the James-Coolidge computation, using just 5 terms, which takes about 70
minutes to run. A molecular energy of
1.6647 and binding energy of De =
4.53 eV are obtained.

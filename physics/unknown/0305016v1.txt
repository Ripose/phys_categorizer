It is increasingly important to support the large numbers of scientists working in remote areas and having low-
bandwidth access to the Internet. This will continue to be the case for years to come since there is evidence from 
PingER performance measurements that the, so-called, digital divide is not decreasing. In this work, we review 
the  collaborative  work  of  The  Abdus  Salam  International  Center  for  Theoretical  Physics  (ICTP)  in  Trieste  -a 
leading  organization  promoting  science  dissemination  in  the  developing  world-  and  SLAC  in  Stanford,  to 
monitor  by  PingER,  Universities  and  Research  Institutions  all  over  the  developing  world  following  the  recent 
“Recommendations of Trieste” to help bridge the digital divide. As  a result, PingER's deployment now covers 
the real-time monitoring of worldwide Internet performance and, in particular, West and Central Africa for the 
first time. We report on the results from the ICTP sites and quantitatively identify regions with poor performance, 
identify trends, discuss experiences and future work.  

1.  OVERVIEW1 

A  large  community  of  scientists  from  developing 
countries  cannot  or  can  only  partially  participate  or 
benefit  from  electronic  science  due  to  the  lack  of 
adequate  network  capacity  or  performance  and 
awareness  about  alternatives.  This  can  adversely  affect 
both 
international 
collaborations such as those in High Energy and Nuclear 
Physics  (HENP),  where  typically  about  10%  of  the 
collaborating sites are in developing countries.  

individual  scientists  and 

large 

To assist in making information available to scientists 
worldwide  a  multidisciplinary  group  of  international 
experts gathered for an open round table on “Developing 
Country  Access 
to  On-line  Scientific  Publishing: 
Sustainable Alternatives” in October 2002 at the Abdus 
Salam  International  Centre  for  Theoretical  Physics 
(ICTP) in Trieste, Italy [1]. The meeting was sponsored 
by  ICSU,  IUPAP,  UNESCO,  TWAS  and  WIF.  Among 
the  10  recommendations  made  [2],  one  was  specific  to 
monitoring: “To devote resources to monitor in real time 
the connectivity of research and educational institutions 
in  developing  countries  and  to  encourage  (and  devote 
resources to) the development of the connectivity”.  

In  December  2002  a  letter  was  sent  to  the  ICTP 
electronic 
(eJDS) 
Journals  Distribution  Service 
collaborators  [3]  with  the  statement  “To  improve  the 
effectiveness  of  the  eJDS  and  make  a  survey  of  those 
places around the World, which have the need of Internet 
infrastructure;  we  plan 
to  monitor  by  PingER, 
Universities  and  Research  Institutions  all  over  the 
developing world”. As a result, the PingER/eJDS project

is  now  monitoring  hosts  at  sites  in  over  40  countries 
subscribing to the eJDS service.  

In  this  work  we  report  on  how  well  PingER/eJDS's 
deployment  now  covers  the  monitoring  of  worldwide 
Internet  performance, 
results  and 
quantitatively  identify  regions  with  poor  performance, 
including real-time monitoring of some African sites for 
the first time.

2.  PingER/eJDS MONITORING 

 
Researchers  in  the  world's  poorest  nations,  where 
Internet  connections  can  be  slow  or  prohibitively 
expensive,  can  now  receive  some  scientific  papers  free 
of charge via the e-mail based eJDS system [3]. Via the 
eJDS,  developing  world  scientists  can  now  have  access 
to  a  much  wider  range  of  current  scientific  information 
and  findings  than  ever  before.  The  eJDS  procedure  to 
follow is similar to that used when connected to any Web 
server by selecting (hyper)links [4, 5].  

Publishers are now able to reach scientists who would 
otherwise  not  have  either  the  technical  or  financial 
means  to  read  articles  in  their  eJournals  in  a  timely 
fashion.  The  Abdus  Salam  ICTP  can  broaden  its  vital 
role  to  meet  its  mandate  and  transfer  knowledge  to 
scientists in the developing countries.  

To  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  eJDS,  the  plans 
are  to  extend  its  reach,  by  providing  support  for  setting 
up the main access to the Internet for remote campuses. 
To  decide  where  and  how  best  to  provide  support  to 
remote  Universities  and  Research 
campuses  of 
Institutions  in  the  developing  world,  it  is  necessary  to 
quantify first the current performance and we plan to do 
this by PingER monitoring [6].

to 

the 

PingER  (Ping  End-to-end  Reporting)  is  the  name 
given 
Internet  End-to-end  Performance 
Measurement  (IEPM)  project  to  monitor  end-to-end 
performance of Internet links (see also [7]). This project, 
initially  set  up  to  monitor  connectivity  to  high  energy 
and  nuclear  physics  institutions  in  many  countries,  has 
grown  to  monitor  many  other  scientific  collaborations 
and now monitors sites in over 75 countries that between 
them  have  over  99%  of  the  worldwide  users  of  the 
Internet.  

To measure network performances, the standard ICMP 
echo  [8]  based  Internet  ping  facility  is  used.  PingER 
packet loss rate has been found to be a good measure of 
the  quality  of  links  with  loss  rates  over  0.1%,  thus  the 
reports in this paper are for packet loss rates.  

At 

losses  of  4-6%  or  more  video-conferencing 
becomes  irritating  and  non-native  language  speakers 
become unable to communicate. The occurrence of long 
delays of 4 seconds (such as may be caused by timeouts 
in recovering from packet loss) or more at a frequency of 
4-5%  or  more  is  also  irritating  for  interactive  activities 
such  as  telnet  and  X  windows.  Conventional  wisdom 
among TCP researchers holds that a loss rate of 5% has a 
significant  adverse  effect  on  TCP performance,  because 
it  will  greatly  limit  the  size  of  the  congestion  window 
and  hence 
is  often 
 
 

transfer  rate,  while  3% 

the 

substantially  less  serious.  A  random  loss  of  2.5%  will 
result in Voice Over Internet Protocols (VOIP) becoming 
slightly  annoying  every  30  seconds  or  so.  A  more 
realistic burst  loss pattern  will result in VOIP distortion 
going  from  not  annoying  to  slightly  annoying  when  the 
loss  goes  from  0  to  1%.  Since  TCP  throughput  goes  as 
1/sqrt  (loss)  [9],  it  is  important  to  keep  losses  low  for 
achieving  high throughput. To assist in categorizing the 
losses  PingER  defines 
loss  quality 
categories:  <  0.1%  =  excellent;  >=  0.1%  and  <  1%  = 
good; >= 1% and < 2.5% =  acceptable; >= 2.5% and < 
5% = poor; >= 5% and < 12% = very poor; > 12% bad. 

the  following 

From  January  2003,  the  PingER  project  has  been 
extended  to  African  countries  and  other  developing 
countries in collaboration with the eJDS project. This has 
successfully  provided  outreach  beyond  high  energy 
nuclear  and  particle  physics.  Special  attention  is  drawn 
to academic sites with low-bandwidth connections to the 
outside world. 

This active PingER/eJDS monitoring is essential to 
catalogue critical needs for networking infrastructure, to 
understand real performance, set expectations, identify 
problem areas, provide information for troubleshooting, 
and to rationalize the allocation of (financial, hardware, 
human, etc) resources to improve the Quality of Service 
and performances.

Internet (e.g., ping must not be blocked or rate limited).  

In  Fig.1  we  show  a  world  map  identifying  countries 
with  hosts  monitored  by  PingER  and  with  institutes 
subscribing  to  the  eJDS  service.  Countries  with  a  dark 
grey  background  have  institutes  participating  in  the 
PingER/eJDS  monitoring.  Countries  with  a  light  grey 
background have hosts monitored by PingER but the sites 
are  not  subscribing  to  eJDS.  Countries  with  a  white 
background have institutes subscribing to eJDS but are not 
monitored yet. The numbers in parentheses are the number 
of  countries  in  the  relevant  category.  Currently  PingER 
measurements  are  made  from  SLAC  to  over  40  countries 
with sites subscribing to the eJDS service.  

PingER/eJDS  packet  loss  measurements  reported  here 
mainly cover from October 2002 until the end of February 
2003.

Figure 2: Packet Loss in percent between SLAC and 
sites in the Middle East. 

Performance to sites in the Middle East shown in Fig.2 
is  mostly  variable  and  indicative  of  congested  links. 
Jordan  (average  loss  ~  3.6%)  and  Egypt  (average  loss  ~ 
2.5%) have poor performance. Some sites perform well. In 
particular, some sites in Iran (average loss ~ 0.6%) exhibit 
low  losses  consistent  with  adequately  provisioned  links. 
Israel  in  general  seems  to  be  well  connected  since  we 
observe very low packet loss to sites in Israel (average loss 
~ 0.06%) compared to other countries in the region. Saudi 
Arabia (the site is an oil platform connected via a satellite) 
exhibits the worst losses (average loss ~ 5.6%). The Round 
Trip  Times  (RTT)  to  Saudi  Arabia  (not  shown  here)  are 
also characteristic (i.e., RTTs of one to two seconds) of an 
overloaded satellite link.

Figure  3:  Packet  Loss  in  percent  between  SLAC  and 
sites in the Caucasus and Central Asia. 

Performance to sites in the Caucasus and Central Asia is 
shown  in  Fig.  3.  The  link  to  Kazakhstan  goes  via 
Stockholm  and  Moscow  utilizing  land  lines  with  an  RTT 
of  about  300ms.  Losses  to  Kazakhstan  are  poor  to  bad 
sometimes  exceeding  over  12%  and  a  median  for  this 
period  of  over  3%,  and  with  much  variability  and  big 
differences (factor of 3.5) between weekday and weekend 
losses  indicating  congestive  losses.  Both  Georgia  and 
Uzbekistan are routed via an earth station located at DESY 
in  Hamburg,  Germany  and  then  via  a  satellite  to  the 
relevant country. Both Georgia and Uzbekistan have RTTs 
of  about  700ms.  Median  losses  to  Uzbekistan  are  about 
2%  and  to  Georgia  about  1%,  less  than  those  to 
Kazakhstan  even  though  the  RTT  to  Kazakhstan  is  less. 
The variability of the losses to Georgia (standard deviation 
of  ~  1.4  %)  and  Uzbekistan  (standard  deviation  ~  1.8  %) 
are also less than those to Kazakhstan (standard deviation 
~3.2  %) 

Initiatives  such  as  the  silk-road  project  are  expected  to 

improve the performance to this region [10]. 
. 

3.3.  Latin America 

Performance to sites in Latin America is variable as can 
be  seen  in  Fig.  4.  Sites  in  countries  with  well  organized 
research  networks  and  a  connection  to  the  AMPATH 
backbone [11] perform well (average packet loss ~ 1%) for 
Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Countries with well organized 
research  networks  but  not  yet  connected  to  or  using 
AMPATH  (e.g.,  Uruguay  and  Venezuela)  have  similar 
loss  rates  but  much  more  variability  (the  standard 
deviation is about three times as large). Sites like those in 
Guatemala  and  Peru  (average  loss  ~  4.3%),  that  route  to 
SLAC across commercial networks perform less well with 
large  (average  loss  ~  4.3%),  variable  packet  loss.  The 
graph  shows  packet  loss  between  SLAC  and  eJDS 
subscribers  grouped  by  country.  These  measurements 
indicate  some  eJDS  subscribers  (e.g.,  Uruguay  and 
Venezuela)  could  achieve 
improved  performance  by 
connecting to AMPATH.

3.4.  Asia  

 
Examples  of  packet  loss  between  SLAC  and  sites  in 
South  and  East  Asia  shown  in  Fig.  5  and  6,  respectively, 
follow  a  similar  pattern  to  Latin  America.  Certain  better 
connected  countries,  (e.g.,  Japan  average  loss  for  this 
period ~ 0.06% and Taiwan average loss ~ 0.1%) perform 
very  well,  but  other  locations,  such  as  Bangladesh, 
Indonesia,  Malaysia  and  Pakistan  (all  over  ~  3%  average 
loss)  and  India  and  Thailand  (around  ~  2%  average  loss) 
perform  less  well.  Fig.  6  shows  low  packet  loss  between 
SLAC and eJDS subscribers in Japan but higher and more 
variable  loss  to  sites  in  China  (average  loss  ~  1.2%)  and 
Korea  (average  loss  ~  0.7%).  The  Asia-Pacific  advanced 
network  (APAN)  provides  excellent  connectivity  to  this 
region [12]. Studies continue in understanding routing and 
bottlenecks.

to  SLAC  by 

PingER/eJDS  sites  in  West  and  Central  Africa  are 
routed 
satellite  connections.  Such 
connectivity  results  in  very  long  RTTs  (e.g.,  1500ms  for 
Nigeria),  and  impacts  interactive  applications.  Fig.  7 
shows  packet  loss  between  SLAC  and  eJDS  sites  in  each 
of three countries being monitored: Nigeria (average loss ~ 
10%), Uganda (average loss 3%) and Ghana (average loss 
~ 7%). In all cases the high packet loss during the working 
week  and  the  lower  packet  loss  at  weekends  is  highly 
indicative  of  congested  links,  although  the  RTT  for 
Uganda is found to be quite stable. Perhaps this is due to 
rate limiting or the presence of only a few users. There are 
a  number  of  projects  that  try  to  assist  in  improving 
performance to sites in Africa [13].

Fig.  8  shows  exponential  fits  to  the  monthly  median 
TCP  throughputs  estimated  using  the  Mathis  formula  [9] 
and  the  PingER  RTTs  and  losses  measured  from  hosts  in 
Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) Laboratories in the U.S. 
to hosts in various regions of the world. The measurements 
go  back  several  years,  in  some  cases  as  far  as  January 
1995.  The  numbers  in  parentheses  are  the  number  of 
monitoring  host  -  remote  host  pairs  included  in  the  fitted 
data.  The  line  labeled  Edu  refers  to  .edu  sites  which  are 
generally  associated  with  U.S.  educational  institutions. 
The dots are for a performance increasing by 80%/year or 
a factor of 10 in 4 years.

various regions of the world. 

It can be seen that though regions such as Latin America 
and  S.  E.  Europe  were  several  years  behind  Europe, 
Canada and Edu sites, they are catching up. Other regions 
such  as  China,  Russia  and  India  are  also  many  years 
behind  and  are  not  catching  up.  Africa  (note  the  report 
only  shows  one  country,  Uganda,  which  is  the  only 
country  for  which  we  currently  we  have  long  term 
measurements) appears to be falling even further behind. 

4.  CONCLUDING REMARKS 

 
PingER/eJDS  deployment  now  covers  the  real-time 
monitoring  of  worldwide  Internet  performance  and,  in 
particular, West and Central Africa for the first time. Table 
1 shows a summary of the losses and RTTs to developing 
countries  in  various  regions  of  the  world.    It  can  be  seen 
that the regions with the worst performance (measured by 
packet  loss)  are  Central  Asia,  Africa,  South  Asia  and  the 
Middle  East  (excepting  Israel),  all  of  which  have  losses 
that are poor to bad.

is 
these  preliminary  measurements, 
evidence  that  some  developing  nations  are  many  years 
behind and are not catching up the exponential  growth of 
Internet  performance  in  industrialized  nations.    This 
discrepancy  in  performance  is  exemplified  by  the  recent 
end-to-end  network 
record  set  between 
throughput 
California and Switzerland by a team of researchers  from 
Caltech, CERN, SLAC and  LANL [14].  This achieved a 
sustained rate of 2.36 Gbits/s (or ~ 300 MBytes/s) or over 
a  TByte/hour.  This  is  over  3000  times  the  performance 
between  SLAC  in  California  and  sites  in  developing 
countries.  Even  if  one  takes  production  paths  available 
today  between  academic  and  research  sites  in  the  U.S., 
Europe, and Japan one can regularly achieve over 200-300 
Mbits/s  [15]  or  over  1000  times  that  available  to  digital 
divide countries. 

It  is  necessary  to  advertise  both  the  eJDS  and  the 
PingER/eJDS  Monitoring  Project  among  Scientists  in 
remote areas. Furnished with the PingER measurements it 
is  possible  to  better  understand  network  performance,  set 
expectations 
interactive 
applications, and decide how to allocate resources.

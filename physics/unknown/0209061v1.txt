Abstract. The Delay Line Distribution System (DLDS) is an alternative to conventional pulse
compression, which enhances the peak power of rf sources while matching the long pulse of those
sources to the shorter filling time of accelerator structures. We present an implementation of this
scheme that combines pairs of parallel delay lines of the system into single lines. The power of
several sources is combined into a single waveguide delay line using a multi-mode launcher. The
output mode of the launcher is determined by the phase coding of the input signals. The combined
power is extracted from the delay line using mode-selective extractors, each of which extracts a
single mode. Hence, the phase coding of the sources controls the output port of the combined
power. The power is then fed to the local accelerator structures. We present a detailed design of
such a system,
implementation methods for the launchers, extractors, and
ancillary high power rf components. The system is designed so that it can handle the 600 MW peak
power required by the NLC design while maintaining high efficiency.

I. INTRODUCTION

During the past few years, high-power rf pulse compression systems have developed

considerably. These systems provide a method for enhancing the peak power

obtainable from the output of high power rf sources. One important application is

driving accelerator structures. In particular, future linear colliders, such as the

proposed NLC, require peak rf powers that cannot be generated by the current state-

of-the-art microwave tubes. The SLED pulse compression system [1] was

implemented to increase the accelerating gradient of the two-mile linac at the Stanford

Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC).

One drawback of SLED is that it produces an exponentially decaying output pulse.

Approaches to shaping the pulse by means of phase or amplitude modulation of the

input pulse [2,3,4] could obtain only modest efficiency. To produce a flat pulse and

improve efficiency, the Binary Pulse Compression (BPC) system [5] was invented.

The BPC system has the advantage of 100% intrinsic efficiency and a flat output

pulse. Also, if one accepts some efficiency degradation, it can be driven by a single

power source. However, The implementation of the BPC [6] requires a large assembly

of over-moded waveguides, making it expensive and extremely large in size. The

SLED II pulse compression system is a variation of SLED that gives a flat output

pulse [7]. The SLED II intrinsic efficiency is better than that of SLED, but not as good

as that of BPC. However, from the compactness point of view SLED II is far superior

to BPC. Several attempts have been made to improve its efficiency by turning it into

an active system [8]. However, the intrinsic efficiency of the active SLED-II system is

still lower than that of the BPC.

The DLDS [9] is a system similar to BPC that utilizes the delay of the electron beam

in the accelerator beam line of the linear collider to reduce the length of the over-

moded waveguide assembly. However, it still uses more over-moded waveguide than

that required by SLED II. To further enhance the DLDS we introduce in this paper a

variation on that system which further reduces the length of the waveguide system by

multiplexing low-loss rf modes in the same waveguide, hence the name Multi-moded

DLDS (MDLDS). This system has an intrinsic efficiency of 100%, and, assuming a

power-handling limit of 600 MW, requires no more delay line per feed than dual-

moded SLED-II (half that of single-moded SLED-II).

In section II, we present a basic description of the system, its function, and our

approach to component design. In section III, we discuss the timing issue of keeping

the rf synchronized with the propagating electron (or positron) beam.

In section IV,

we describe the design and implementation of the multi-mode launcher, including

mode converting cross-section tapers.

In section V, we describe some ancillary

components, such as bends. In section VI, we illustrate the integration of components

into a combining/launching circuit.

In section VII, we describe the mode-selective

extractor and tap-offs for distributing power

from a given waveguide to the

appropriate structures. We conclude in section VIII.

II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION

In a DLDS system, groups of klystrons are made to deliver their combined power to

a sequence of distantly separated accelerator feeds during consecutive time-bin

divisions of the full operating pulse. Power direction is accomplished by switching

the relative phases of the rf drives. With a proper passive, matched circuit, four

sources, for example, can be made to feed four feeds through the four orthogonal

phase combinations. During the first time-bin, power is shipped furthest upstream;

during the last, it is delivered locally. The shortened propagation distance of the rf

combines with the later arrival of the beam to allow time for the structures powered by

each consecutive feed to be filled. With MDLDS, we eliminate the need for a separate

delay line to transport the rf to each feed. Power is delivered to two or more feeds

through the same waveguide by using different modes as the carriers and inserting

specially designed extractors to direct each mode to its proper destination.

The modes of choice in our circular waveguide delay lines are the low-loss TE01º

mode and the TE12º mode*. The TE12º mode becomes highly efficient as we increase

the waveguide diameter. At a diameter of approximately five times the free space

wavelength, this mode has the lowest attenuation after the well-known TE01º mode.

Recently this has been verified experimentally [10].

The initial three-mode plan for the MDLDS system utilized the TE01º mode and both

polarizations of the TE12º mode. Component designs for that system involved

coupling slots and irises, which had the potential to occasion rf breakdown limitations.

As our system must be able to carry up to 600 MW, we have more recently

concentrated our efforts on a more conservative two-mode approach in which we

manipulate the rf in moderately overmoded, rectangular waveguide. Transitioning to

and from the highly overmoded circular delay line waveguide will be done through

special mode-order-preserving tapers. Current component designs exploit planar

symmetry, which allows for more facile mode manipulation and for the use of

waveguide of arbitrary height to limit field levels. Our goal has been to keep the

electric field below ~40 MV/m while at the same time aiming for compactness to

minimize ohmic losses.

* We use a superscripted circle with circular waveguide modes to avoid confusion with rectangular
waveguide modes, to which this paper will also refer.

Figure 1 gives a schematic of a module of our MDLDS, whose components will be

described below. Eight 75 MW, 11.424 GHz klystrons are combined in pairs, yielding

four independently phased sources. The combined 600 MW, 1.5 µs pulse is phased

into four 375 ns time bins. The feeds are numbered to show the order in which they

receive power. Each feed delivers a nominal 200 MW to each of three structures. A

number of interleaved modules power the intervening structures.

III. TIMING

Because the rf power is being injected at different times into different modes that have

different group velocities, one must pay special attention to timing. The set of

equations that needs to be satisfied so that each group of accelerator structures gets an

rf pulse for a duration τ at the appropriate time is:

IV. LAUNCHER

Several

ideas for the launcher have been proposed [11,12]. In all of them, a

fundamental property of the launcher has been preserved: the launcher has only four

inputs, and the launcher has to launch four and only four modes. If such a device is

matched for all four orthogonal input conditions, because of unitarity and reciprocity,

the scattering matrix representing the launcher has to take the following form:

This form forces isolation between inputs; i.e., none of the input ports will receive

any reflected power as a result of one or more sources dropping out or failing. If one

of the four power sources fails (two klystrons are off), the available power at the

intended destination will be reduced by a factor of 9/16, and the total acceleration by

3/4.

If one klystron in any pair fails, half of the remaining klystron’s power will go to

a load on the fourth port of the hybrid through which they are combined, so the

available input to the launcher will be reduced by a factor of 1/4. The total combined

power is then reduced by a factor of 49/64, and the acceleration by a factor of 7/8.

More generally, the power available at the structures is proportional to the square of

the fraction of operating klystrons, and the gradient is proportional to that fraction.

The fraction of the power that

is misdirected as a result of klystron failure is

distributed between loads and the wrong structure sets for each time bin.

B. Cross Potent Superhybrid/Launcher

The move in our pulse compression work toward rectangular waveguide

components, in which planar symmetry is exploited to allow arbitrary height, began

with the design of planar hybrids [13] to replace magic T’s in the SLED-II system of

the ASTA (Accelerator Structure Test Area) facility at SLAC. These had been

exhibiting rf breakdown problems above 200 MW, particularly at the mouth of the E-

plane port. One novel hybrid design has an “H” geometry (see Figure 11). Its central

guide is wide enough to support two TE modes, and, at its junctions, triangular wall

protrusions yield, essentially, double mitred bends. Prototypes have been built and

successfully operated at peak power levels approaching 500 MW.

If two such “magic H” hybrids, with ports half the width of the central guide, are

placed side-by-side and their common wall removed, the resulting oversized ports

have the same cross-section as the central guide. If these are split again with T’s at the

proper distance, the symmetry is completed, and an eight port device in the shape of a

cross potent (a heraldic cross with a bar at each extremity) results. This “cross potent

superhybrid” can be used to combine power from four input ports, by proper phasing,

into any one of four output ports. Opposite pairs of cross arms are isolated. A

prototype has been built and its scattering parameters measured with a network

analyzer, with very satisfactory results [14].

b) TE20 in the right overmoded rectangular port with the indicated relative phases for four equal

amplitude inputs. Alternate phasings of the inputs send the power to either of the left ports.

Of course, one can leave off the T split on one or more of the arms, substituting

posts for matching, and consider the rectangular TE10 and TE20 modes as the

orthogonal outputs or inputs for such arms. This cross potent launcher configuration

and its function are illustrated in the HP HFSS [15] simulation field plots of Figure 2.

The wide waveguide width is 1.442 inches, and the height can be chosen to

accommodate the taper/converters described below. Combined with these taper/

converters, it will allow the desired modes to be launched into circular waveguide

delay lines from four independently phased sources.

C. Circular-to-Rectangular Taper Converter

One can generate TE12º from TE11º via an adiabatically corrugated, or rippled,

circular waveguide. The wall undulations can be designed to pass TE01º unperturbed.

The challenge then becomes to launch TE01º and TE11º into the same waveguide and to

extract one while passing the other.

The components to be described throughout this paper perform these functions with

the rectangular TE10 and TE20 modes. We can use them in our system without

sacrificing the benefits of circular waveguide delay lines if we can transition between

the two cross-sections in such a way that a one-to-one correspondence is achieved for

the respective operating modes. An adiabatic cross-section taper naturally converts

TE10 to TE11º. TE20, however, tends to produce a combination of the circular modes

TE21º and TE01º. The cross-section deformation must be done in two or more properly

designed and spaced taper sections to yield finally a pure TE01º wave [16]. A taper-

mode transducer accomplishes this in the space of a few inches without compromising

the TE11º conversion. This design is illustrated in Figure 3 with electric field plots

from an HP HFSS simulation. The parasitic mode loss is negligible.

(Since the

rectangular to circular transition preserves mode order and the TE01º cutoff is above

that of TE21º, it is technically the higher cutoff polarization, TE02, which produces

TE01º. However, a slight width taper, necessary to match into the following

components, makes the dimension along which the field varies larger, correcting this

nomenclature at the port.) The ending diameter is 1.6 inches. The TE11º- TE12º

conversion and transition to low-loss 4.75 inch diameter guide is made through a taper

design described below which also preserves TE01º.

D. Diameter Taper/Mode Converter

The design of this component is more challenging than a typical converter taper

design in that it must convert the TE11º to the TE12º mode with at least 99% conversion

efficiency while passing the TE01º mode with minimal mode conversion. The

component is also operated bi-directional, that is, it must convert a TE12º mode at the

output back into a TE11º mode.

In addition, the converter-taper combination should

have reflections below -26 dB for both the TE11/12º mode and the TE01º mode.

FIGURE 4. Profile of Diameter Taper-Converter.

The converter and taper profiles were all optimized for mode purity using a cubic

spline fit of selected points along an initial guess for the wall profile. Using a cubic

spline fit [17] (with zero derivative end conditions) ensured that the resulting wall

profile varied smoothly so as to minimize unwanted reflections. The initial trial shape

for optimization was a sinusoid with a period equal to the beat wavelength of the TE11º

and TE12º modes. The total length of the system consisting of an initial up-taper

followed by the converter and a final taper was 97.5 cm. The final converter taper had

a mode purity of 99.8% for TE12º and 99.9% for TE01º, and the all return loss factors

were less than -30 dB. A plot of the taper profile is shown in figure 4.

V. BENDS AND OTHER COMPONENTS

The physical layout of our rf system will require bends which, because the system is

overmoded, are not completely trivial. Even at places where a single mode is used,

power levels generally do not allow us to reduce the cross-section back to single-

moded waveguide. We now describe plans for negotiating such bends and otherwise

manipulating the rectangular modes.

A. Overmoded H-plane Bend

We have designed a 90º H-plane bend in the 1.442 inch-wide waveguide mentioned

above. Just as we found a radius-of-curvature that gave 50% conversion at 45º for the

extractor, one expects that certain bending radii will bring power coupled along the

bend completely back to the entering mode. We find that, for this cross-section at our

operating frequency, a bend with a radius-of-curvature from the inner wall of

1.409 inches transmits each of the two operating modes with essentially 100% purity

from input to output, as shown in Figure 5. As with the above planar components,

other propagating modes, including TM modes, are not coupled in these bends. Since

reflections are negligible and the coupling is only between TE10 and TE20, the solution

automatically works for both modes.

a)

b)

FIGURE 5. Overmoded H-plane bend in 1.442” waveguide with simulated electric field plots

illustrating a) TE10 mode transmission and b) TE20 mode transmission.

B. Jog Converter

A 45º H-plane bend with an inner-wall radius-of-curvature of 1.055 inches first

mixes the two rectangular guide modes, converting either input

into an equal

combination of TE10 and TE20. A second such bend may be located so as to either

return the coupled power to the original mode or transfer the remaining power from it.

This second bend can be in the same or the opposite sense, resulting in either a 90º

bend or a jog.

The “jog converter” is a compact mode transducer, consisting of two oppositely

oriented 45º bends, separated by a very short phasing section, which gives complete

conversion between TE10 and TE20. It works in either direction, for either input mode.

This simple device is shown in Figure 6. It is used at several points in our rf system

plans.

It can be combined with a rectangular waveguide taper and a rectangular-to-

circular taper converter of the type described above to form a novel TE10 to TE01º

launcher.

FIGURE 6. Jog converter geometry with simulated electric field plots illustrating conversion from TE20

to TE10 (left to right) or from TE10 to TE20 (right to left).

C. Overmoded E-plane Bend and Height Taper

There are points in our rf system where components are required for which planar

symmetry cannot be maintained. Two rectangular waveguide components that fall

into this category are E-plane bends and height tapers.

In our power-combining waveguide configuration, a few E-plane bends are

unavoidable. It is desirable, for power handling and matching into other components,

that these be in full overmoded height. Fortunately, they needn’t be in our full

overmoded width; thus, only TE10 must be transmitted. This mode is coupled strongly

to TM11 in such a bend. At a 0.900”×1.435” cross-section, an inner (bottom) wall

radius-of-curvature of 1.510 inches returns a quite pure TE10 mode (99.96%) at 90º, as

seen in Figure 7a). The surface field is enhanced within the bend, but the maximum

power it needs to handle in our system is only 75 MW.

While the above bend and parts of other components propagate a single TEn0 mode,

it has been assumed that the rectangular guide components described above will be

built with an overmoded height (allow propagation of modes with non-zero second

index). At points in the rf system, specifically at the structure inputs, it will be

necessary to transition to true single-moded waveguide. Figure 7b) shows a

preliminary double-stepped height taper design shown in going from 0.900”×0.400”

(WR90) to 0.900”×1.210” in less than an inch with perfect transmission. However,

even with well-rounded edges, the field enhancement gives ~70 MV/m at 200 MW.

Thus, while an adiabatic three inch linear taper can be added to bring this device to the

final 1.435 inch height while minimizing mode conversion to TM12 and TE12, we plan

to develop a more compact design with lower surface field.

VI. THE 4-WAY COMBINER/LAUNCHER CIRCUIT

The launcher circuit can be constructed using the waveguide components described

above. Figure 8 illustrates a way of combining power through eight input ports into

either mode in a dual-moded delay line (1), one mode in a second delay line (2), or a

local feed (3).

The cross-potent superhybrid is used three times. At the first level, signals from each

set of four klystrons are combined, using superhybrids, and directed to one of two

modes in a transfer waveguide. On the second-level, the mode used in both transfer

lines determines which way the power turns at the center of the superhybrid, and the

relative phase of the two signals determines where it goes from there.

Note that using this configuration, rather than combining pairs of klystrons for four

separate feeds to the final cross potent, allows the power to be fed from the first level

to the second level in two dual-moded waveguides. This halves the number of transfer

lines,

the assumption that

the klystron gallery and delay line

installation are physically remote (the latter presumably being in the accelerator

tunnel).

superhybrid.

For the E-plane bends shown, the power is first split by T-junctions, matched for

both modes, and later recombined in the same way. This allows use of the half-power,

TE10 bends described above. It also provides an opportunity to introduce a π/2 phase

length difference in the two arms, required for power direction in the cross potent

VII. EXTRACTOR AND TAP-OFFS

A. Mode-Selective Extractor

One system feed spacing before the end of a dual-moded delay line, one mode is

extracted and fed into the accelerator. Following the proper tapers and converters, the

extractor begins in the same rectangular dimensions as the launcher output. A 45º

bend like that at the beginning of the jog converter leaves power entering in either

operating mode in an equal mixture of the two. A short straight section is used to

achieve the proper relative phase. Then a doubly matched T split, at which the TE10

field adds constructively to one lobe of TE20 and destructively to the other, sends all

the power one way for a given extractor input mode and all the power the other way

for the other input mode. Since the two input modes result in combinations with

opposite relative phases, they excite opposite ports at the split. Again, we illustrate the

geometry and function with field plots in Figure 9. Since it corresponds to the circular

delay line mode with the greater attenuation, the TE10 mode is selected for extraction.

Single-moded 45º H-plane bends orient the extraction port waveguide perpendicular

to the delay line and the through port waveguide parallel to it, although slightly offset.

The latter is then tapered to full width and sent through a dogleg or jog converter,

described above, which simultaneously brings the port back in line with the delay line

axis and restores the TE20 mode. An identical mode converter can be appended to the

extraction port, so that, through rectangular-to-circular taper converters, the power will

be re-launched in either the delay line or the accelerator feed in the more efficient

circular TE01º mode. By reciprocity, power reflected from either output port will be

returned to the input port in the mode in which it arrived.

B. PowerDistributing Tap-Offs

Each feed from the MDLDS shown in Figure 1 delivers ~600 MW to a set of three

consecutive accelerator structures. After the waveguide turns to run parallel to the

accelerator, first one third of the power will need to be removed for the first structure,

and then one half of the remaining power will need to be removed for the second

structure before the feed terminates in the third. We plan to do this as well in

overmoded planar rectangular waveguide components.

One idea is to simply peel off a lobe from the appropriate TEn0 mode for each tap-

off. The TE30 mode can be generated in widened waveguide from TE10 or TE20 by a

planar converter (see for example [18], pg. 6). One third of the waveguide could then

be interrupted by a mitred bend, which leaves two thirds of the field pattern and of the

power to form a TE20 wave in the continuing guide. At the second structure, one half

of a TE20 wave is similarly diverted. This concept for a 4.77-dB and a 3.01-dB power

divider is illustrated in Figure 10.

a)

b)

FIGURE 10. Tap-offs utilizing the idea of achieving fractional power division by deflecting a lobe of

a TEn0 field pattern. This requires converting to TE30 before the first of a structure triplet.

To isolate the structures in case of rf breakdown,

it may be preferable to use

directional couplers instead. A hybrid of the “magic H” type on which the cross

potent launcher is based can serve for the second tap-off. This is illustrated in

Figure 11. For the first tap-off, the hybrid design can be modified to give the proper

1/3-2/3 split. This is simply a matter of adjusting the differential phase length of the

coupling section while maintaining the match. Any reflected power from the

structures would then travel back through the waveguide system or into high power

loads on the fourth ports of the directional couplers. A second design with reduced

coupling can serve for the 1/3 power tap-off.

Jog converters may be used here, as

shown, if the accelerator structure length warrants going to TE01 in between structures

for reduced losses.

As the structure inputs will be spaced about two meters apart, it is worthwhile to

convert back to the circular TE01º mode in between them. Taper converters combined

with jog converters will get us to and from the proper rectangular mode.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS

We have described a dual-moded MDLDS rf waveguide system for the NLC and

several novel components designed to accomplish the various required functions. The

relatively open geometry and exploitation of planar symmetry in our design motif

allows us to keep the peak surface fields at reasonable levels for 600 MW at X-band.

The use of highly-overmoded, circular waveguide is maintained for low-attenuation in

delay lines and power transport, while rectangular waveguide is used in moderately

overmoded components for the flexibility and simplicity of design provided by

reduction to two dimensions. The current two-mode scheme requires one third less

delay line than a simple four-feed DLDS. The designs described here might be

suitably scaled for operation at 30 GHz or higher to serve in a pulse compression

system for a higher frequency linear collider or for any other rf system with high

power and small bandwidth requirements. Their simplicity may recommend them for

use at low power as well.

Abstract: 

 

The  formation,  deformation,  and  break-up  of  liquid  interfaces  are  ubiquitous 

phenomena in nature. In the present article we discuss the deformation of a liquid interface 

produced  by  optical  radiation  forces.  Usually,  the  bending  of  such  an  interface  by  the 

radiation  pressure  of  a  c.w.  laser  beam  is  weak.  However,  the  effect  can  be  enhanced 

significantly  if  one  works  with  a  near-critical  phase-separated  liquid  mixture,  whereby  the 

surface tension becomes weak. The bending may in this way become as large as several tenths 

of micrometers, even with the use of only moderate laser power. This near-criticality is a key 

element in our experimental investigations as reviewed in the article. The effect is achieved 

by  working  with  a  micellar  phase  of  microemulsions, at room temperature. We give a brief 

survey  of  the  theory  of  electromagnetic  forces  on  continuous  matter,  and  survey  earlier 

experiments in this area, such as the Ashkin-Dziedzic optical radiation force experiment on a 

water/air surface (1973), the Zhang-Chang experiment on the laser-induced deformation of a 

micrometer-sized spherical water droplet (1988), and the experiment of Sakai et al. measuring 

surface tensions of interfaces in a non-contact manner (2001). Thereafter, we survey results

I - Introduction 

 

 

 

 

 

Formation, deformation and break-up of fluid interfaces are ubiquitous phenomena in 

daily  life  that  play  a  significant  role  in  science  and  technology  [1].  From  the  fundamental 

point  of  view  they  also  illustrate  a  fascinating  behavior  called  finite  time  singularity  [2], 

where  the  most  common  and  famous  example  is  the  break  up  of  pendant  drops  driven  by 

gravity [3, 4]. Extension to drop deformation under an applied field proved to be even richer 

due to the addition of an external control parameter. For example, interface instabilities driven 

by electric fields [5, 6] represent nowadays the corner stone of many industrial processes as 

different as electro-spraying [7], ink-jet printing [8] or surface relief patterning [9]. A uniform 

magnetic field can as well destabilize fluid interfaces to create well-organized peak structures 

[10,  11]  or  to  form  elongated  magnetic  droplets  [12].  These  deformations,  as  well  as  those 

induced by the acoustic radiation pressure on liquid surfaces [13, 14], were essentially used to 

explore  and  characterize  in  a  non-contact  way,  the mechanical properties of fluid interfaces 

[15, 16]. 

 

Surprisingly,  such  a  strategy  has  been  extended  to  the  optical  deformation  of  soft 

materials only recently. Indeed, while the interaction between a laser wave and a micrometer-

sized dielectric particle has attracted considerable interest in recent years, and most advances 

were  devoted  to  optical  levitation  and  trapping  (for  a  recent  review  see  for  example  [17]), 

much  less  attention  appears  to  have  been  directed  to  the  deformation  of  soft  transparent 

interfaces  despite  its  large  field  of  practical  applications  (see  below).  The  main  reason  is 

linked to the fact that deformation of fluid interfaces by the optical radiation is intrinsically 

weak.  It  is  also  very  sensitive  to  secondary  disturbing  effects  associated  to  the  optical 

absorption of the fluids (laser heating, convection or thermocapillary effects or instance). 

The  present  survey  is  devoted  to  the  analysis of this coupling  between  interface and 

laser  waves.  We  theoretically  describe  and  experimentally  explore  laser-induced  liquid 

interface deformations driven by radiation pressure. As optical radiation pressure effects are 

weak, experimental investigations were performed on the meniscus of phase separated liquid

mixtures close to a liquid-liquid critical point. Indeed, since surface tension vanishes close to 

a  critical  point,  near-critical  interfaces  become  highly  deformable.  Moreover,  as  surface 

tension, and density and refractive index contrasts are continuous functions of the temperature 

shift to the critical temperature, it becomes  possible to tune the fluid properties by working 

with  a  single  medium  and  simply  adjusting  one  parameter.  Finally,  close  to  a  critical  point 

most liquids belong to the universality class  (

d

=

3,n

=

1

)

 of the Ising model, where  d  is the 

space  dimension  involved,  and  n   the  dimension  of  the  order  parameter  (here  the  density 

contrast). Our results can thus be generalized to any fluids belonging to the same universality 

class. 

 

In these conditions, huge stationary interface deformations of several tens of microns 

can be induced with low beam c.w. lasers. The continuous variation of the surface softness by 

a  temperature  scanning  also  allows  a  universal  description  of  the  phenomenon  because  it 

becomes  possible  to  overlap  the  range  of  variation  of  the  excitation  and  the  hydrodynamic 

length scales, respectively given by the  beam waist and the capillary length. New predicted 

behaviors  in  linear  interface  deformation  are  then  seen  to  occur,  particularly  the  transition 

from a non-local to a local excitation of the interface when the critical point is neared. All the 

data can then be cast on a single master curve when rescaled with an optical Bond number. As 

interface bending by radiation pressure is expected to be independent on the direction of the 

beam propagation, we also generalize our universal description to both upward and downward 

exciting beams. 

 

On  the  other  hand,  as  surface  tension  can  becomes  very  weak,  we  also  investigated 

nonlinear  regimes  in  deformation.  We  show  that  deformations  become  asymmetric  versus 

beam propagation. While surprising stationary tether shapes are observed when the exciting 

beam crosses the interface from the low to the large refractive index liquid, the induced hump 

can become unstable for sufficiently large beam intensities in the opposite case. We analyze 

this  new  opto-hydrodynamic  instability,  by  exploring  the  universal  behavior  of  its  onset. 

When properly rescaled, the dispersion in measured onsets, versus temperature shift and beam 

waist, also reduces to a single master behavior, which is retrieved theoretically from simple 

arguments.  Above  onset,  the  optically  driven  interface  instability  leads  to  the  formation  of 

stationary  beam-centered  liquid  micro-jet  emitting  droplets,  which  anticipates  the  bases  for 

new applications in microfluidics and liquid micro-spraying. Finally, when working in finite 

geometry, the induced liquid jets lead to the formation of stable liquid columns of very large 

aspect ratio that would be unstable otherwise. These laser-induced liquid columns behave as 

 

4

reconfigurable  self-written  optical  waveguides  and  provide  opportunities  for  building  new 

microfluidic-based devices for applications in adaptative optics. 

 

The  review  is  organized  as  follows.  Before  discussing  our  results,  we  present  in 

Section  II  a  well-documented  survey  on  optical  manipulation  of  liquid  interfaces.  As  a 

theoretical description of laser induced interface deformation by radiation pressure is of great 

importance to analyze experimental results, we give a general description of electromagnetic 

forces on dielectrics in Section III, and show how a laser wave can couple to a liquid interface 

and drive its bending. Section IV is an experimental section. The fluid media used as well as 

the  experimental  setup  is  presented.  Our  investigation  of  interface  bending  by  the  radiation 

pressure starts in Section V. We investigate the linear regime in deformation for both upward 

and  downward  beams,  we  show  that  associated  deformations  are  symmetric,  and  give  a 

universal  description  of  the  involved  phenomenon.  We  finally  use  interface  deformation  as 

adaptative  lenses  actuated  by  laser  light.  Our  investigation  of  nonlinear  behaviors  begins  in 

Section  VI.  We  show  that  tether-like  stationary  deformations,  instead  of  continuous 

elongation,  are  generated  when  the  beam  intercepts  the  interface  from  the  fluid  of  lower 

refractive  index.  Consequently,  the  symmetry  observed  for  linear  deformations  is  broken  at 

large beam intensities, since the beam can either induce a tether-like deformation or a liquid 

jet  depending  on  the  direction  of  propagation.  This  "opto-hydrodynamic"  instability  is 

analyzed,  particularly  the  universal  behavior  of  jetting  onset.  A  comparison  with  already 

published data is also performed. Section VII is devoted to an extension of the previous one. 

As  experiments  are  always  performed  in  finite  size  volume,  we  show  how  liquid  jetting 

driven  by  radiation  pressure  can  be  used  to  form  and  stabilize  liquid  columns  of  very  large 

aspect  ratio.  Since  these  liquid  columns  have  a  larger  refractive  index  than  the  surrounding 

fluid, they behave as reconfigurable adpatative optical fibers. This optical application as well 

as further potentialities in microfluidics is presented in Section VIII. We finally conclude in 

Section  IX.  Considering  the  good  agreement  observed  between  theory  and  experiments,  as 

well as the  diversity  in produced  liquid structures, the  present  review "rehabilitates"  optical 

surface  forces  for  further  appealing  investigations  and  applications  that  require  micrometric 

length scale contact less manipulation of liquid interfaces.

II - Optical Manipulation of Fluid Interfaces: a Brief Overview 

II.1 – Indirect Laser-Induced Interface Deformation 

 

Since  their  invention  in  1986,  optical  tweezers  [18]  have  been  recognized  as  a 

fundamental tool to manipulate micro-objects. An obvious extension going one-step forward 

optical  trapping  itself  is  to  use  the  trapped  particle  either  as  a  probe  of  the  surrounding 

environment or as an actuator to constrain this environment. The first aspect is often related to 

the so-called optical dynamometry [19], while the second type of application has been widely 

used to induce an optical non-contact forcing on the studied structure in order to analyze how 

it adapts to this forcing or how it relaxes to its initial state after removing optical excitation. 

The  study  of  red  blood  cells  (RBC)  is  particularly  illustrative  because  RBC's  are  highly 

deformable. For example Block and co-workers [20] tweeze a RBC against flow in order to 

analyze the resulting cell conformation. Cell relaxation from a parachute shape was measured 

on  RBC  deformed  by  a  triple  optical  tweezers  [21].  A  third  experiment  was  performed  by 

attaching  two  beads  to  the  RBC  membrane,  to  trap  optically  these  beads  and  to  stretch 

indirectly  the  cell  by  pulling  one  beam  from  the  other  [22].  While  this  experiment  gives 

access to an order of magnitude of the shear modulus of RBC's, it is nevertheless limited due 

to the fact that the bead sticking locally modifies the membrane properties. Another method 

consists in encapsulating a bead in a biologic membrane to form a tether by pulling it from the 

cell center [23]. Such an experiment gives access to the membrane viscosity. Conversely, one 

can  exploit  the  relaxation  of  this  tether.  For  example  Steffen  and  co-workers  [24]  formed  a 

long  filament  by  stretching  the  interface  between  two  coexisting  phases  in  a  Langmuir 

monolayer. They deduced the value of the line tension between these two phases by analyzing 

the tether relaxation. All these experiments clearly show how the use of an intermediate bead 

by  optical  tweezing  allows  the  deformation  of  soft  objects  and  the  characterization  of  their 

surface property. However, since the trapped beads also bring difficulties in the interpretation 

of  the  results,  a  step  forward  in  interface  deformation  analysis  has  been  to  remove  this 

intermediate element in order to try to excite directly a membrane with a laser beam. While a 

major limitation in using directly focused beams on biologic objects is the excess overheating 

resulting from light absorption, a point which explains the use of intermediate beads, lasers 

can  also  alter  membranes  by  simple  optical  interaction.  Indeed,  when  a  beam  is  highly 

focused on a deformable membrane, mechanical effects of light tend to attract large refractive 

index  matter  toward  the  focus.  This  effect  locally  induces  excess  in  surface  tension  of  the 

 

6

membrane  that  is  responsible  to  the  so-called  "pearling  instability"  of  cylindrical  vesicles 

[25].  Local  bilayer  separation  within  the  membrane  or  micro-vesicle  expulsion  by  laser-

induced tension within the mother's membrane can also be generated. All these phenomena, 

and  particularly  their  dynamical  aspect,  were  described  in  a  review  on  laser-membrane 

interaction [26] and were theoretically interpreted [27]. Consequently, an intermediate bead is 

not always necessary to deform a soft interface. Direct effects of light beams on membranes 

are also observable and measurable, even in strongly nonlinear regimes. We will follow this 

direction in order to show how direct radiation pressure effects can be fully exploited. 

II.2 – Direct Laser-Induced Interface Deformation: Optical Aspects 

While the first experiment on deformation of liquid interface by the radiation pressure 

of  a  laser  wave  [28]  is  contemporary  to  the  beginning  of  experiments  on  optical  levitation 

(they  were  developed  by  the  same  authors),  this  optical  manifestation  did  not  received  the 

same  enthusiasm  neither  development,  until  very  recently.  To  explain  this  unbalanced 

situation,  we  will  underline  the  intrinsic  difficulties  encountered  in  performing  this  type  of 

experiment as well as the different possibilities that can be used to overcome them. 

A Qualitative Explanation 

Considering  some  theoretical  developments  [29],  the  first  motivation  of  Ashkin  and 

Dziedzic  was  to  determine  in  which  direction  occurs  the  bending  of  a  fluid  interface 

separating two dielectric liquids of different refractive indices. According to other researchers 

this  experiment  could  also  bring  some  new  insights  on  the  right  formulation  of  the 

electromagnetic  energy-momentum  tensor  in  dielectrics,  either  the  Minkowski  or  the 

Abraham  expression  (see  Section  III).  Even  if  the  direction  of  laser-induced  interface 

deformation  cannot  answer  this  question,  the  result  obtained  by  Ashkin  and  Dziedzic  was 

sufficiently surprising and non intuitive to present a qualitative interpretation. 

Let  us  consider  a  laser  beam  at  normal  incidence  to  the  fluid  interface  between  two 

dielectric liquids 1 and 2, respectively characterized by the refractive index 

1n  and 

2n  (Figure 

II.1). We assume an ascending beam propagating along the  ˆz  direction and

agreement with the experiments presented in Section IV but of course, this particular case is 

just chosen to illustrate the phenomenon without removing any generality of our purpose. We 

can  write  momentum  conservation  for  the  system  (photons+  interface)  for  an  elementary 

surface element  dS  during the time  dt . If ν is the optical frequency, photon momentum p in 

a  medium  of  index  of  refraction  n  can  classically  be  written  as 

=p

nh cν   [30].  Then 

momentum conservation leads to:

where N denotes the number of incident photons per surface and time unit, and  R  and  T  the

  at  normal  incidence,  we  finally 

find that momentum transferred to the interface per surface and time unit is: 

Since the beam intensity I is given by  =I Nhν, the radiation pressure

Eq. (3) shows that the associated force is generated by the photon refraction at the interface. 

However, the most surprising prediction is that interface bending does not necessarily occur 

in  the  direction  of  beam  propagation.  As  we  supposed 

n
<1

n ,  according  to  Eq.  (2)  the 

deformation  is  always  directed  towards  the  less  refractive  liquid,  i.e.  liquid  1  in  our  case, 

whatever the beam propagation is. Indeed, for a descending laser beam we should substitute 

1n  by 

2n  and  ˆz  by  −ˆz  which let Eq. (2) invariant. This means that interface bending does not 

depend  on  beam  propagation,  and  the  main  reason  for  that  is  that  photon  gains  momentum

this remarkable property, which will be quantitatively illustrated in Section IV.

The experiment of Ashkin and Dziedzic 

Ashkin  and  Dziedzic  [28]  performed  an  experiment  using  a  frequency  doubled 

Nd:Yag  laser  (wavelength  in  vacuum  λ =0

0.53 µm )  strongly  focused  on  the  water/air 

interface  (beam  waist  value  ω =0

2.1 µm ).  Due  to  the  large  value  of  the  water/air  surface 

tension (σ

=

73 mJ .m ) they worked with laser pulses (pulse duration  60 ns  and peak power 

2
−

between  1  and  4 kW )  to  increase  radiation  pressure  effects.  Since  the  interface  bending  is 

still very weak (typically a few tens of nanometers in height) with these excitation conditions, 

it is not directly observable. However, as an interface deformation behaves as a lens, one can 

deduce from the associated focal distance both the direction of the deformation and its height 

[29].  Ashkin  and  Dziedzic  use  these  properties  to  demonstrate  that  interface  deformation  is 

always directed towards the medium of smaller index of refraction whatever the direction of 

beam propagation is. A quantitative interpretation of these experimental results is nevertheless 

difficult due to the spatial and temporal profiles of the laser pulses used. For example, in his 

theoretical interpretation, Brevik [31] had to consider a larger beam waist and to use a time 

delay  to  retrieve  the  temporal  behavior  of  the  induced  lens.  On  the  other  hand,  we  should 

stress  that  very  few  results  related  to  the  deformation  of  fluid  interfaces  by  the  optical 

radiation  pressure  have  been  published.  From  the  theoretical  point  of  view,  one  can  cite  a 

9

description of Ashkin and Dziedzic experiment [32] and articles on the associated beam self-

focusing in linear media [29, 33]. On the other hand, except a brief letter [34], we are aware 

of a second set of experiments realized at the liquid/air interface [35] using a ruby laser. As 

interface  bending  was  still  very  weak,  detection  was  performed  by  holographic 

interferometry.  Nice  agreement  between  theory  and  experiments  is  found  but,  as  in  Ashkin 

and  Dziedzic  experiment,  deformations  are  not  stationary  and  their  weakness  prevents  any 

direct observation.  

Droplet Deformation and Optical microcavity 

Using  a  high  speed  camera,  Zhang  and  Chang  [36]  performed  the  first  direct 

observations of laser-induced interface deformation on spherical water droplets. The droplets 

(radius  =a

50 µm )  were  illuminated  by  a  dye  laser  (wavelength  in  vacuum  λ =0

0.6  µm , 

pulse duration  0.4 µs , and beam waist value  ω =0

200 µm ). A first series of images shows 

oscillations of the interface after the passage of a  100 mJ  pulse. This series clearly evidenced 

that  interface  deformation  is  directed  towards  the  air  on  both  side  of  the  drop  with  a  small 

asymmetry on the exit face coming from the increase in intensity due to the ball lens effect of 

the drop. Even more surprising, they show that  200 mJ  pulses lead to the formation of a long 

liquid  filament  on  the  exit  face  of  the  drop  and  droplet  disruption.  Beyond  the  spectacular 

observations,  these  experiments  were  motivated  by  a  research  on  the  modification  of  the 

optical  properties  of  dielectric  spheres.  Indeed,  it  is  well  known  that  drops  illuminated  by 

laser  waves  behave  as  optical  microcavities  in  which  whispering  gallery  modes  and 

morphology dependent resonance are induced [37]. These properties can be tuned or altered 

by  disturbing  the  shape  of  the  drop  [38].  Consequently,  laser-induced  liquid  droplet 

deformation  can  be  exploited  to  increase  the  optical  coupling  with  the  incident  beam  [39]. 

Finally, a quantitative interpretation of the Zhang and Chang experiment was given by Poon 

and coworkers [40] and further developed by Brevik [41]. Numerical simulations are in good 

agreement with experiments, even in the nonlinear regime in deformation. 

II.3 – Application of Laser-Induced Interface Deformation to Soft Matter Physics 

 

 

 

 

 

 

10

 

While optical bending by laser waves was clearly evidenced, the preceding paragraph 

also  showed  that  the  effect  is  very  weak  on  classical  interfaces  because  radiation  pressure, 

which is proportional to the index contrast between the two liquids in contact, has to compete 

with the stabilizing effect of surface tension. This is certainly the reason why so few works 

have been dedicated to radiation pressure. However, the eighties have seen the emergence of 

the so-called soft matter physics that brought a sort of new birth to laser radiation pressure by 

opening new horizons beyond the optical physics area. 

Characterization of Weak Surface Tensions and Surface Waves 

Recently,  a  Japanese  team  exploited  the  bending  of  an  interface  by  a  laser  wave  to 

measure interfacial tensions [42] in a non-contact manner. Indeed, for particular experimental 

conditions,  it  will  be  shown  in  the  following  that the height  of  the deformation  is inversely 

proportional  to  the  surface  tension  of  the  fluid  interface.  As  deformations  are  weak  for 

classical  interfaces,  they  measured,  as  Ashkin  and  Dziedzic,  the  associated  lensing  effect. 

Interface bending is induced by a c.w. Ar+ pump laser (wavelength in vacuum 

λ =

)  and  probed  with  a  He-Ne  Laser 

( 0

) by analyzing far field diffraction. Note that for a beam power  P 0.3 W

 and 

a beam waist

, they found for the deformation of the water free surface a height 

of  2 nm !  After  a  calibration  of  their  set-up  with  the  water  free  surface,  they  extended  the 

technique  to  interfaces  modified  by  adding  a  mystiric  acid  monolayer.  Their  measurements 

compared well with results obtained from the classical Wilhelmy's method. They also perform 

dynamic  characterizations  of  interfaces.  By  modulating  the  pump  beam,  they  showed  that 

radiation  pressure  can  excite  surface  waves,  and  they  measured  their  power  spectrum.  In  a 

second  work  [43],  they  focused  their  attention  on  the  difficult  case  of  ultra  low  surface 

tension,  for  which  most  classical  techniques  fail.  Finally,  they  showed  the  pertinence  of 

radiation  pressure  to  excite  high-frequency  capillary  waves  [44],  and  measured  shear 

viscosities.

The  characterization  of  the  mechanical  properties  of  lipidic  membranes  is  of 

fundamental  interest  in  biophysics.  Since  optical  dynamometry  is  limited  to  large  vesicles, 

Wang  's  group  used  radiation  pressure  to  quantitatively  measure  curvature  rigidity  of  small 

vesicles  [45]  and  in  vivo  cells  [46]  at  a  nanometric  length  scale  (see  above).  Compared  to 

optical  dynamometry,  these  experiments  show  that  the  main  interests  in  using  radiation 

pressure are the strong localization of excitation as well as its non-invasive character  

On the other hand, Käs' group patented a new tool to probe elasticity of cells using the 

radiation  pressure.  The  apparatus,  called  "Optical  Stretcher",  stretches  cells  trapped  by  two 

beams propagating in opposite directions (c.w. Ti-Sapphire lasers working at 

λ =
0

0.780 µm

). 

The advantage of this dual trap is a self-centring of the trapped cell associated to a symmetric 

radiation  pressure  effect  on  both  cell  hemispheres,  in  opposition  to  the  Zhang  and  Chang 

experiment  [36].  Consequently,  the  cell  stretches  along  the  beam  axis  as  a  soft  dielectric 

medium  [47].  The  magnitude  of  the  forces  applied  to  the  cell  varies  from  the  pico-  to  the 

nano-newton, i.e. typically one hundred times larger than that obtained by optical tweezing, 

by reducing radiation damage due to the fact that beams are not strongly focalized. Advantage 

of radiation pressure effect over stretching via attached beads trapped in a dual tweezers, is 

once more clearly evidenced. Due to its sensitivity, the ultimate goal of this technique is to be 

able to differentiate healthy to malignancy cells from the difference in elastic response [48]. 

Finally we should note that cells deform nonlinearly at large power excitation as illuminated 

droplets. 

II.4 – Summary 

We showed in this section that direct radiation pressure effects are, in many situations, 

complementary  to  optical  tweezing,  particularly  in  soft  matter  physics  where  they  are  very 

efficient in characterizing fluid interfaces and membranes. However, although one of the most 

important advantages of the technique is that it is non-invasive, we have seen that little work 

has been devoted to the induced deformations. The reason is simple; discontinuity in photon 

momentum at an interface is weak and then, radiation pressure is also a weak effect that is not 

always  observable.  On  the  other  hand,  the  use  of  high  intensity  lasers  does  not  represent  a 

significant  advance  in  this  area  because  an  increase  in  intensity  inevitably  leads  to  strong 

thermal effect that usually dominates radiation pressure [49]. Consequently, radiation pressure 

12

deserves further investigations, and we will show in the following that appropriate interfaces 

allow  for  enhanced  effects  that  are  particularly  appealing  for  the  analysis  of  the  general 

properties of radiation pressure effects: independence of deformation versus beam direction, 

associated lens effect, and non-linear deformations at high laser intensities. However, before 

discussing these manifestations, we need to clarify the theory devoted to mechanical effects of 

light in dielectric matter. This is the subject of the following section. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

III – Electromagnetic Forces on Dielectrics 

III.1 – Basics 

We begin by writing down the commonly accepted expression for the electromagnetic 

  in  an  isotropic,  nonconducting  and  nonmagnetic  medium  (see,  for

(III.1) 

(cid:74)(cid:71)
Here  E

(cid:74)(cid:74)(cid:71)
  and  H

  are  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields,  ρ  is  the  mass  density  of  the  medium 

(fluid),  ε is the permittivity, and ς ε ε=

0  is the relative permittivity where  ε0  denotes the 

permittivity of vacuum. 

Let us comment on the various terms in Eq.(III.1), beginning with the last term. This 

term  is  called  the  Abraham  term,  since  it  follows  from  Abraham's  electromagnetic  energy-

momentum tensor. The term is experimentally detectable under special circumstances at low 

frequencies [31], but not at optical frequencies, at least not under usual stationary conditions. 

The Abraham term simply fluctuates out. 

The middle term in Eq.(III.1) is the electrostriction term. When seen from within the 

optically denser medium (the medium with the highest ς), the electrostriction force is always 

compressive. Whether this kind of force is detectable in a static or a stationary case, depends 

on  whether  the  experiment  is  able  to  measure  local  pressure  distributions  within  the 

compressed region or not. Moreover, in a dynamic case the velocity of sound is an important 

13

factor.  If  the  elastic  pressure  in  the  fluid  has  sufficient  time  to  build  up,  then  the 

electrostriction force will not be detectable when measuring the gross behavior of a fluid such 

as  the  elevation  of  its  surface.  Such  is  usually  the  case  in  optics.  The  time  required  for  the 

counterbalance to take place, is of the same order of magnitude as the time needed for sound 

waves to traverse the cross section of the laser beam. For a beam width around  10 µm , this 

yields  a  time  scale  for  counterbalance  of  the  order  of  10 ns .  For  instance,  in  the  Ashkin-

Dziedzic  experiment  [28]  a  detailed  calculation  shows  that  this  time  scale  was  verified;  cf. 

Figure 9 in Ref. [31]. 

 

Another point worth mentioning in connection with the electrostriction term is that we 

have written  (

)ε ρ∂ ∂

S

 as an adiabatic partial derivative. This seems most natural in optical 

problems in view of the rapid variations of the field, at least in connection with laser pulses. 

In many cases it is however legitimate to assume that the medium is nonpolar, so that we need 

not distinguish between adiabatic and isothermal derivatives. The permittivity depends on the 

mass density only. Then derivative can be written simply as  ε ρd

d , and is calculable from 

the  Clausius-Mossotti  relation.  In  this  way  we  can  write  Eq.(III.1)  in  the  following  form, 

when omitting the last term,

(III.2) 

Finally,  we  have  the  first  term  in  Eq.(III.1),  which  may  be  called  the  Abraham-Minkowski 

force, since it follows equally well from the Abraham and the Minkowski energy-momentum 

tensors:

(III.3) 

This  is  the  only  term  that  we  have  to  take  into  account  in  practice  in  optics,  under  usual 

circumstances.  We  see  that  this  force  is  equal  to  zero  in  the  homogeneous  interior  of  the 

medium,  and  acts  in  the  inhomogeneous  boundary  region  only.  By  integrating  the  normal 

component  of  the  Abraham-Minkowski  force  density  across  the  boundary,  we  obtain  the 

surface  force  density  which  is  often  evaluated  as  the  jump  of  the  normal  component  of  the 

electromagnetic Maxwell stress tensor. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14

 

In  the  following  we  thus  focus  attention  the  force  term  in  Eq.(III.3)  only.  As  a 

parenthetical remark, we note that this expression has shown its applicability in the quantum 

world also, in connection with the Casimir effect [52]; for recent reviews see [53, 54, 55]. The 

main expression giving the force between two parallel dielectric slabs because of zero-point 

oscillations  of  the  electromagnetic  field  (this  is  the  so-called  Lifshitz  formula),  is  actually 

based  upon  use  of  the  expression  (III.3),  combined  with  the  quantum  mechanical  Green 

function expression. Modern experiments have actually verified the accuracy of the Lifshitz 

formula  up  to  an  accuracy  of  a  few  per  cent.  Even  corrections  to  the  Lifshitz  formula,  like 

those  arising  from  finite  temperature  effects,  are  at  present  under  active  theoretical  and 

experimental study [56]. 

III.2 –Surface Tension and Radiation Forces on a Curved Surface 

To begin with, we assume that there is a curved surface 

=z

(
h x, y,t

)

 distinguishing 

two  fluids,  a  lower  fluid  (1)  and  an  upper  fluid  (2).  The  surface  is  assumed  to  have  been 

displaced  by  the  combined  effect  of  gravity,  surface  tension,  and  radiation  pressure.  The 

equilibrium  position  of  the  surface  is  the  −x

y   plane.  Usually,  stationary  conditions  are 

considered,  so  that 

=z

(
h x, y .  However,  when  at  first  dealing  with  the  general  theory,  we 

)

shall not limit ourselves to necessarily stationary conditions. 

Because  of  the  surface  tension  coefficient  σ,  there  will  be  a  normal  stress 

proportional to the mean curvature of the surface:

locally be regarded as plane waves and that the surface can locally be regarded as plane. The

Consider  now  the  electromagnetic  surface  force  density,  which  we  will  call  Π .  As 

mentioned above, Π  can be found by integrating the normal component of the volume force 

density across the surface boundary layer. From Eq.(III.3) it follows that the surface force acts 

normal to the surface, and that it is directed towards the optically thinner medium. 

We introduce the intensity  I  of the incident beam,

When the surface is horizontal,

A property of the expression (III.20) that facilitates practical calculations is that it is 

quite insensitive with respect to variations in the polarization angle α, especially in the case 

when 

12n  is close to unity, which is in practice most important as we have noted. Thus if we 

draw  curves  for

IV – Experimental Section 

 

 

 

 

 

 

We  have  seen  in  Sec.  II  that  deformations  induced  by  a  continuous  laser  beam  on 

classical  interfaces  were  nanometric  and  required  high  intensity  laser  pulses  to  observe  a 

microscopic height. Thus, direct visualization of micrometric deformations induced by a c.w. 

Argon ion laser obviously necessitates very soft interfaces. To do so, we choose to work with 

near-critical  interfaces  because  surface  tension  vanishes  close  to  a  critical  point  as 

σ σ=
0

CT T

−

1

, where  T  and  CT  are respectively the actual and the critical temperature. 

1.26

Moreover, at a given distance to the critical temperature, supramolecular liquids lead to even 

smaller  surface  tension  because  the  amplitude 

0σ   is  inversely  proportional  to  the  square  of 

the  characteristic  molecular  length  scale 

0ξ ,  according  to  renormalization  group  theory. 

Consequently, in order to enhance radiation pressure effects on fluid interfaces, we performed 

experiments  in  near  critical  phase  separated  micellar  phase  of  microemulsions.  As  they 

belong to the same universality class ( d

3= ,  n

1= ) of the Ising model as most of isotropic 

liquids,  our  particular  choice  will  be  of  general  meaning  and  can  be  transposed  to  any 

interface separating liquids belonging to the same universality class.  

IV.1 – Properties of the Micellar Phase of Microemulsion used 

A  polar  hydrophilic  head  and  a  hydrophobic  tail  generally  compose  amphiphile 

molecules.  This  peculiarity  allows  them  to  self-assemble  in  solution  in  various  forms  and 

architectures.  Micellar  phases  of  microemulsion  correspond 

to  one  of 

these 

thermodynamically stable structures. They are obtained by mixing at least three constituents: 

water, oil, and a surfactant. A fourth constituent (generally an alcohol called co-surfactant) is 

nevertheless added to increase the mixture stability. When the volume fraction of added water 

is of the order of a few percents, surfactant molecules adsorb at the water/oil interface to form 

a  spherical  shell  around  water  nano-droplets.  This  assembling,  constituted  by  surfactant-

coated  water  nano-droplets  suspended  in  oil,  is  called  micellar  phase  of  microemulsion. 

Consequently, this mixture can be assimilated to a binary mixture composed of a solute (the 

micelles)  and  a  solvent  (the  oil).  In  our  experiments,  we  used  a  mixture  of  sodium  dodecyl 

sulfate  (surfactant),  water,  toluene  (oil)  and  n-buthanol-1  (alcohol).  Its  mass  composition  in 

22

weight  fraction  is  4 %   SDS,  9 %   water,  70 %   toluene,  and  17 %   n-butanol-1.  For  this 

composition,  the  micelle  radius  is 

40 2 Å
±

,  i.e.  one  order  of  magnitude  larger  than 

ξ =
0

classical molecular length scale, and small enough to still be transparent in the visible optical 

wavelength window. This composition was also chosen so as to be critical at a temperature 

CT

=

35  C
°

 [59]. As illustrated in Figure IV.1, for a temperature 

T T>
C

, the mixture phase-

separates in two micellar phases of different concentration Φ. According to renormalization 

group  theory,  the  amplitudes 

0σ   and 

0ξ   are  related  by  a  universal  ratio  R +   defined  as 

R

+ =

)

=

 [60]. This means that surface tension in micellar systems is weak 

compared  to  liquid-vapor  interfaces.  For  example,  for  our  particular  mixture  at  1.5 K  from 

the  critical  point,  σ  is  one  million  times  smaller  than  that  of  the  water  free  surface 

(
σ

=

72 mJ .m

).  This  weakness  clearly  illustrates  the  reason  why  we  can  expect  large

interface deformations using c.w. lasers.

Another advantage of near-critical systems is the possibility to continuously tune fluid

As these quantities can be varied over significant range, they illustrate the usefulness of near 

critical  fluid  interfaces  for  investigating  the  influence  of  fluid  properties  on  interface 

deformation  using  a  single  sample  and  low  power  lasers.  By  combining  these  critical 

amplitudes, we can also predict the critical behavior of more complex quantities that appear 

when dealing with interface deformations, such as the capillary length  Cl

Finally,  in  order  to  analyze  radiation  pressure  effect,  thermal  heating  should  not  disturb

IV.2 – Experimental setup 

The  experimental  setup  is  presented  in  Figure  IV.2.  As  beam  intensity  depends  on 

both power and beam radius, the main point is to form a beam waist 

0ω  in the cell C on the 

meniscus of the phase-separated mixture and to vary its size. To do so, we use the lens L1 to 

form a first intermediate waist. The variation of the beam waist 

0ω  is performed by moving 

the prism Pr to increase the optical path between L1 and the focusing long working distance 

microscope objectives, either O1 or O2 ( 10 × ). As the beam waist position varies within the 

24

 

 

 

 

 

 

cell,  C  is  mounted  on  translation  stages  to  locate 

0ω   on  the  interface.  Moreover,  since 

interface deformation should not depend on the beam propagation direction, our setup allows 

for ascending and descending beams by using the half-wave plate λ/2 and the beam splitter 

BS.  Interface  deformations  are  induced  by  the  radiation  pressure  of  a  c.w.  Ar+  laser 

(wavelength in vacuum 

λ =

0.514 µm

) in the TEM00 mode. Using this procedure accessible 

values  are

  (resp.

frame  grabber.  A  spectral  filter  is  also  placed  between  the  microscope  and  the  C.C.D.  to 

eliminate residual laser light scattered by the micellar phases.

V – Interface Bending in the Linear Regime in Deformation [61] 

While  radiation  pressure  effects  on  interfaces  are  usually  weak,  in  the  preceding 

section  we  have  seen  how  to  significantly  enhance  laser-induced  interface  deformations. 

Consequently  it  becomes  possible  to  directly  visualize  interface  bending.  This  section  is 

devoted to what we call the linear regime, i.e. the regime for which the bending slope is weak. 

While it corresponds to the most classical situation, the following section will present results 

when deformations become highly nonlinear. 

V.1 – Stationary interface deformations 

Figure  V.1  gives  two  typical  examples  of  interface  bending  observed  in  different 

conditions for an ascending beam (Figure V.1a:

, and Figure V.1b:

14.6  µm

). As the refractive index 

1n  of the incident fluid phase is lower 

than that of the upper phase, interface deformation occurs downward as expected. Its height 

also increases versus beam power. Moreover, by comparing both series, we see that its shape 

depends significantly on the beam waist. Temperature dependent effects are less obvious, but 

they  will  be  evidenced  in  the  following.  To  explain  the  shape  of  these  deformations,  let  us 

consider  a  flat  fluid  interface  at  rest  and  of  infinite  extension.  The  general  expression 

governing  the  steady  state  interface  shape

results from the compensation of radiation pressure

1

weak  deformations,  one  can  use  the  expression  of  R   and  T   at  normal  incidence,  and 

linearize curvature. In these conditions Eq. (V.1) reduces to

(V.4) 

Eq. (V.4) describes the shape of the induced deformation in the linear regime in deformation. 

Before  solving  this  equation,  we  perform  a  dimensional  analysis  of  the  different  terms 

involved in order to point out the relevant physical parameters.

  and

,  buoyancy  and 

curvature can as well compete together and their comparison leads to introduce a new length 

scale, the capillary length  Cl

. If  R  denotes the typical width associated to the radial extension 

of  the  induced  deformation, 

( )
rh r∆

  scales  as 

h R .  Consequently,  the  ratio  between

where  Cl

  is  the  capillary  length.  This  is  an  intrinsic  medium-dependent  length 

scale.  To  compare  the  relative  importance  of  buoyancy  versus  surface  tension  effects  on 

interface deformation, one has to compare the characteristic extension  R  to  Cl

. For 

R

i.e. at small length scales, deformation is dominated by surface tension while in the opposite 

case

C

 radiation pressure will mainly compete with buoyancy. As deformations are due 

to the radiation pressure of a laser beam of beam waist 

0ω , we can assume 

R ω≈

 and define 

an "Optical" Bond Number  Bo  as:

(V.6) 

This means that the induced deformation can be viewed as a sort of virtual particle of 

radius 

0ω .  Moreover,  as  Cl

  is  a  characteristic  medium-dependent  length  scale  that  only 

depends on the vicinity to the critical point, and 

0ω  is a second length scale of optical nature 

that  can  be  tune  externally  and  independently  to  Cl

,  existence  of  a  relevant  Bond  Number 

gives  us  the  possibility  to  scan  interface  deformation  driven  by  radiation  pressure  from  the 

low to the large  Bo  regime. 

V.2 – Asymptotic regimes and universal behavior 

Height of deformations is the weak optical Bond number regime 

The  Bo

1<<   regime  corresponds  to  the  case  of  usual  interfaces  [28,  35,  42],  where 

capillary waves are mainly driven by surface tension. Eq. (V.4) becomes:

corresponds  to  a  nonlocal  regime  in  deformation.  This  peculiarity  is  easily  understood  in

mode  q , then

of the  q 0=  mode. The beam waist does not influence deformation anymore. A larger length 

scale should control it instead. As we investigate the  Bo

1<<  regime, the other length scale is 

necessarily  the  capillary  length.  Considering  that

logarithmic  correction,  are  retrieved  for  the  three  experiments  Consequently,  these

deformation over large variation in optical and thermodynamic length scales. It also illustrates 

the strength of critical fluids as well as the associated thermodynamic universality. Indeed, if 

we  have  been  able  to  illustrate  scaling  for  the  first  time,  this  is  because  we  used  fluid 

interfaces  whose  properties  can  be  continuously  tuned.  However,  the  Bo

1<<   regime 

corresponds in fact to the case of usual interfaces for which buoyancy is generally neglected. 

Another peculiarity of our system is also to allow the investigation of the opposite  Bo

1>>  

regime, where deformations are stabilzed by gravity.

Height of deformations is the large optical Bond number regime 

When  Bo

become negligible compared to buoyancy. In this case, according to Eq. (V.4), the height of 

the induced deformation is described by:

Contrary to the  Bo

to  beam  intensity.  The  response  of  the  interface  to  the  optical  excitation  becomes  local;  in 

Fourier space one has

 is still constant, due to 

the fact that index and density contrast have the same critical behavior. 

To investigate the  Bo

the critical point with large beams. Results are presented in Figure V.4 for (

Moreover,  although  slopes  of

Scaling and universality in interface deformation 

To find a general scaling the deformation height versus optical excitation, we need to 

integrate  Eq.  (V.4).  As  the  beam  intensity  is  of  cylindrical  symmetry,  we  use  the  Fourier  –

Bessel transform defined as:

problems  involving  Gaussian  functions  because

Eq. (V.14) was used to compare prediction with the whole profile of stationary deformations

can extract an analytical expression for the height of the deformation

universal  character  is  also  underlined  by  the  representation  of  a  data  point  measured  at  the 

water free surface in Ref. [42].

(

shows the location of the datum (empty circle) given in Ref. [42] for the water/air free surface 

at room temperature. 

Consequently,  Figure  V.6  can  be  viewed  as  a  sort  of  abacus.  Knowing  the  fluid 

properties,  one  can  predict  the  deformation  versus beam characteristics and conversely, any 

measurement of the height of the deformation can be used to measure the surface tension in a 

contact less way. Moreover, as illustrated in Section II, the method can easily be extended to 

characterization of visco-elastic media, such as biological cells. 

V.3 – Up/down symmetry 

We demonstrate in Section II that interface deformation by the radiation pressure does 

not depend on direction of beam propagation because photon momentum varies linearly with 

index  of  refraction.  However,  in  calculating  the  Fresnel  coefficient  of  transmission  and 

reflection, we have to take into account the fact that the incident medium changed; using our 

notations,  for  a  descending  beam  incidence  corresponds  to  medium  2.  The  behavior  of  the 

interface is then described by:

(V.17) 

This description is totally analogous to that given for an upward beam (Eq. (V.4)), except that 

a 

2n  associated to incidence replaces 

1n  in the amplitude factor of the radiation pressure. As 

we wanted to verify this prediction, we inverted the direction of propagation by turning the 

2λ   plate  (Figure  IV.2).  We  performed  a  new  set  of  experiments.  Two  examples  are 

presented  in  Figure  V.7  for  the  two  extreme  temperatures  of  the  investigated  range.  As 

expected,  interface  still  deforms  towards  the  medium  of  smaller  refractive  index.  The 

interface shape is also very similar to those observed with an upward excitation.

As the theoretical profiles of deformations induced by upward and downward beams 

are almost identical due to the fact that 

n

 for near-critical interfaces, we should retrieve 

the same universal behavior in both cases. Results are presented in Figure V.8. We observe a 

nice superposition of upward and downward data. As far as deformations belong to the linear 

regime, the predicted scaling law is then valid whatever the beam direction is.

V.4 – Application to adaptative lensing [64] 

The generally weak amplitude (nanometric scale) of the interface deformation induced 

by radiation pressure of c.w. laser on classical interfaces makes them difficult to characterize, 

except  by  using  the  associate  lensing.  Indeed,  the  deformation  corresponds  to  a  curved 

interface between two media of different refractive indices, and can thus be assimilated to a 

"soft" lens. In the paraxial approximation,  the focal  distance  f  is proportional to curvature 

[65]:

(V.20) 

Eq. (20) shows that the focal distance associated to a deformation is directly proportional to 

surface tension. Even for weak deformations, one can measure the associated focal distance 

by analyzing in far field the intensity profile modification of a second probe beam. This is the 

method used by Sakai and coworkers [42, 43] to measure surface tensions. It is particularly 

efficient for very weak surface tension as far as one can calibrate the setup with an interface 

of known surface tension. As in our experiments deformations are microscopic, we can easily 

revert the method and measure actual lensing driven by radiation pressure. 

Considering  Eq.  (V.20),  we  expect  the  following  critical  behavior  for  the  focal 

distance at fixed beam intensity:

; lines correspond to predictions. 

Agreement  is  observed  with  the  expected  critical  exponent.  Moreover,  the  interesting  point 

here  is  the  tuning  of  the  focal  distance  by  temperature.  For  example,  at  a  given  beam 

intensity, it is possible to control the focal distance over a large variation ( 0.5

≤

f

≤

2.5 mm

) 

just by changing temperature.  

41

 

Figure  V.9:  Variation  of  focal  length  induced  by  optical  bending  versus  temperature.  The 

curves represent predictions from Eq. (V.21). 

On  the  other  hand,  once  the  range  of  variation  is  fixed  by  temperature,  further 

adjustment  can  be  realized  by  varying  beam  intensity.  As  predicted  in  Eq.  (V.20)  for  the 

Bo

1<<   regime,  f   is  inversely  proportional  to  beam  intensity.  Figure  V.10  illustrates  this 

behavior. A power law fit retrieves the expected hyperbolic behavior. 

One can thus consider the deformation of a fluid interface as a lens of variable focal 

distance. By adjusting temperature and beam parameters, we are able to reversibly adapt  f  

over almost two orders of magnitude, typically from  0.5  to  50 mm . Even if the most reliable 

adaptative  lenses  are  actually  based  on  electro-wetting  (see  [66]  for  a  review),  soft  lenses 

induced by the optical radiation pressure present many advantages. First, they are completely 

optically driven. Second, the adaptation range is important, and several setups that use such a 

liquid lens were devised [67]. One might nevertheless wonder at which level of development 

our type of sensitive media can be confidently used.

VI – Nonlinear Deformation and "Optohydrodynamic" Instability 

In  the  linear  regime  in  deformation  we  have  assumed  that  heights  were  sufficiently 

weak  to  be  able  to  linearize  the  curvature  κ  and  to  consider  optical  interaction  at  normal 

incidence.  However,  these  approximations  obviously  fail  at  larger  radiation  pressure  due  to 

the fact that low surface tension systems, as the one we use are highly deformable. We call 

this regime, the nonlinear regime in deformation. 

VI.1 – Nonlinear interface deformations 

Let us first consider an upward beam propagating from the low to the large refractive 

index  liquid  phase.  As  illustrated  in  Figure  VI.1  the  interface  shape  becomes  nonlinear  for 

increasing  incident  beam  powers.  For  beam  power  P 355 µm

≤

  deformations  show  up  a 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43

regular  bell  shape,  whereas  they  stretches  out  and  switches  progressively  to  a  surprising 

tether-like shape of increasing pedestal for  P 475 µm

≥

. These tethers are stable. They do not 

break into droplets despite their aspect ratio larger than onset for Rayleigh-Plateau instability 

of liquid columns (see Section VII). Note that nonlinear stretching  was already  observed in 

red blood cell deformations [48].

(VI.3) 

Eq. (V.3) describes the height of the induced deformation whatever the incidence angle is. We 

assumed a TE wave for the expressions of  R  and  T . Due to the cylindrical symmetry of the 

deformation, a priori such an assumption is debatable because the polarization state is always 

characterized  by  a  mixing  state  between  TE  and  TM  waves.  However,  as  n

0∆ →   for  near 

critical interfaces, the difference between TE and TM waves vanishes when approaching the 

critical point.

Figure VI.2: Definitions of incidence and transmission angles for an upward beam. 

To  test  if  Eq.  (VI.3)  can  describe  the  observed  tether-like  deformation,  we  solved  it 

numerically. Comparison between Figure VI.1 and Figure VI.3 shows disagreement since we 

could not reproduce numerically the observed tether shapes. The proposed reason for such a 

disagreement is also presented in Figure VI.3, where the beam propagation within the tether 

can be observed in Inset. While our model supposes that the intensity profile of the exciting 

beam  is  always  Gaussian,  we  see  that  such  a  hypothesis  breaks  due  to  the  strong  focusing 

induced by the tip of the deformation and the optical guiding within the tether. The laser wave 

induces a deformation, which in turn modifies the beam profile.

(VI.3)  for 

=P 180, 270, 355, 475, and 600 mW .  Inset  illustrates  the  probable  reason  for 

discrepancy between measured and computed interface shapes: the exciting beam within the 

deformation is no more Gaussian within the tether due to light focusing and guiding.

However,  we  observe  semi-quantitative  agreement  between  the  calculated  and  the

VI.2 - Up/down symmetry breaking [58] 

Let  us  now  consider  a  downward  beam  propagating  from  the  large  to  the  low 

refractive  index  liquid  phase.  Comparison  of  the  resulting  interface  deformation  with  the 

upward case is presented in Figure VI.5, while the variations of the height of the deformation 

versus incident beam power are shown together for both cases in Figure VI.6.

While for an upward beam we observe the continuous transition from a bell shape to a tether 

of  increasing  pedestal,  the  morphology  is  totally  different  when  the  beam  propagates 

downward  from  large  to  low  refractive  index  fluids.  In  the  downward  beam  case,  the 

deformation height deviates from the linear regime for increasing incident beam powers and 

diverges at some well-defined beam power threshold  P↑ . Above this instability onset a beam 

centered stationary liquid jet forms that emits droplets at its tip.

VI.3 – Interface instability and jet formation [68] 

Interface instability onset 

Interface instability driven by radiation pressure only occurs if the incident fluid has 

the  largest  index  of  refraction.  To  illustrate  its  origin,  we  present  in  Figure  VI.7  pictures 

49

showing  together  the  interface  and  the  beam  propagation,  taken  during  destabilization  for  a 

beam  power  larger  than  onset,  instead  of  increasing  beam  power  larger  than  P↑ .  At  early 

stage,  we  can  observe  the  lens  effect  associated  to  interface  bending.  As  the  deformation 

grows we further see the beam focalization within the deformation followed by a strong beam 

trapping  and  guiding  when  jet  forms.  These  pictures  clearly  illustrate  the  coupling  between 

propagation and deformation. As fluid inside deformation has the largest refractive index, the 

observed beam focalization could be explained by total internal reflection of light, which in 

turn would increase light intensity and radiation pressure on the tip deformation, and so on.

Comparison with the Zhang-Chang experiment [36] 

Zhang  and  Chang  performed  experiments  on  deformation  and  rupture  of  water 

droplets  using  high  intensity  laser  pulses.  As  our  model  is  performed  for  near-critical 

interfaces,  universality  implies  that  Eq.  (VI.8)  should  be  also  applicable  to  the  water  free 

surface  (

σ =

70  mN m

  at  room  temperature).  Moreover,  even  if  the  curvature  of  water 

droplets can induce further beam focusing on the rear face, Eq. (VI.8) should at least retrieve 

the  right  order  of  magnitude  for  droplet  rupture.  We  find  P

29 kW

  for  a  beam  waist 

↑ =

ω =
0

100 µm

.  Zhang  and  Chang  found  that  droplet  rupture  occurs  in  between  100 mJ   and 

200 mJ   laser  pulse.  However,  we  have  to  be  careful  in  directly  comparing  the  associated 

values to our predicted onset because they used laser pulses instead of continuous waves. It is 

thus physically more appropriate to perform comparison in term of time dependent intensity 

rather  than  beam  power  [41].  The  pulse  spatio-temporal  profile  can  be  modeled  as 

(

  is  T

  value.  However,  this  value  corresponds  to  a  low  limit,  as  Zhang  and 

Chang  observed  liquid  jetting  for  laser  pulses  of  energy  in  between  100 mJ   and  200 mJ . 

There are also several others reasons that prevent a very accurate comparison. As several data 

are missing (pulse characterization and accurate measurement of jetting onset, for instance), 

our calculation is just estimation. Moreover, we did not take into account the curvature of the 

deformed  droplets,  and  its  influence  of  radiation  pressure  transfer  through  transmission  and 

reflection coefficients. Finally, Eq. (VI.8) just describes the onset of the interface instability, 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55

while the jet structure is preserved at larger beam power [71]. Nevertheless, even if agreement 

between  predictions  and  experiments  is  semi-quantitative,  our  investigation  constitutes  the 

first attempt at comparison on this difficult nonlinear problem. 

Liquid jet control by optical radiation pressure 

As  already  illustrated,  interface  instability  at  P↑   leads  to  the  formation  of  a  beam 

centered  liquid  jet.  Despite  continuous  emission  of  liquid  droplets,  the  mean  jet  length  is 

stationary  for  a  given  experimental  conditions.  However,  as  length  of  classical  jet  is 

controlled by the flow rate, the length of optically driven liquid jets can be continuously tuned 

by increasing beam power. This is illustrated in Figure VI.12. The first picture corresponds to 

a  beam  power  P 420 mW

=

  smaller  than  P↑ .  The  fourth  following  pictures  are  dynamical 

views of the development of the jet instability at  P

490 mW

. The jet reaches a stationary 

↑ =

length  but  a  continuous  emission  of  droplets  from  the  tip  persists.  As  the  distance  from  the 

meniscus  to  the  down  limit  of  pictures  is  800 µm ,  we  see  that  jet  length  is  approximately 

300 µm   while  typical  length  for  tethers  is  of  the  order  of  a  few  tens  of  microns.  The 

interesting point here is that further increase in  P  increases the jet length as illustrated in the 

following  pictures.  Consequently,  as  for  the  case  of  linear  deformation,  one  can  still  have 

control  over  the  nonlinear  regime  by  simply  modifying  the  characteristics  of  the  exciting 

beam.

VII – Laser-Sustained Liquid Columns 

While  since  the  beginning  we  always  discussed  interfaces  deformations  induced  by 

radiation  pressure  within  an  "optical"  context,  their  nonlinear  behaviors  are  extremely 

surprising  for  the  point  of  view  of  hydrodynamics  since  liquid  fingers  of  large  aspect  ratio 

should not be stable. Indeed, beyond a certain aspect ratio, liquid columns are known to break 

into droplets due to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability [2]. Noticeable is the fact that laser waves 

are  able  to  stabilize  structures  that  would  be  unstable  otherwise.  This  can  be  easily 

demonstrated by removing the optical excitation; Rayleigh-Plateau rupture of stationary jets 

occurs  instantaneously.  This  optical  stabilization  pushed  us  to  try  to  stabilize  real  liquid 

columns under intense illumination.

VII.1 - Liquid Bridges and Rayleigh-Plateau Instability 

The  standard configuration for liquid bridge analysis is presented in Figure VII.1. A 

liquid bridge corresponds to a liquid zone of finite volume  V  surrounded by a second fluid 

and stabilized between two solid surfaces by surface tension. A parameter that characterizes 

the  bridge  is  its  aspect  ratio  Λ  defined  as  the  ratio  of  its  height  L   over  its  diameter  2R : 

Λ=

L 2R

.  Such  freestanding  structure  plays  a  major  role  in  many  sciences  as  different  as 

crystal  growth  by  the  floating  zone  method  [72],  micropowder  adhesion  [73],  or 

nanolithography  [74].  However,  all  these  processes  encounter  a  fundamental  limitation 

associated to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability [2]. In weightless conditions, a cylindrical liquid 

column becomes unstable and beaks when its length exceeds its circumference, i.e.: 

Λ

=

>

.

As Rayleigh-Plateau instability is driven by surface tension, above its onset the liquid column 

breaks into droplets. Buoyancy even lowers the instability onset given by Eq. (VII.1).

and volume  V ) of fluid  2 , sustained between two rigid boundaries in a fluid  1 . The aspect 

ratio Λ is defined as Λ= L 2R . 

58

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Great  deals  of  efforts  have  therefore  been  devoted  to  bypass  this  fundamental 

limitation. Gravity was compensated by magnetic fields [75]. Liquid bridges were stabilized 

under  axial  and  radial  electric  fields  for  both  dielectric  [76]  and  conducting  [77]  liquids. 

Active  control  by  acoustic  radiation  pressure  was  used  [78].  The  largest  value  reached  was 

5Λ=   [79].  We  show  in  the  following  subsections  that  optical  radiation  pressure  helps  in 

largely overshooting this value. 

Before  studying  radiation  pressure  effects  on  liquid  columns,  let  us  define  two 

important  quantities.  To  analyze  liquid  bridge  stability  in  presence  of  buoyancy,  i.e.  in  the 

most  classical  situation,  one  has  to  compare  buoyancy  and  surface  tension  effects.  As  in 

Section V, this comparison leads to the definition of a classical Bond number: 

Bo

=

∆ρ
σ

gR
R

=

2

gR
∆ρ
σ

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(VII.2) 

As buoyancy compete with surface tension, the Rayleigh-Plateau onset strongly depends on 

Bo  [80]. On the other hand, when an electromagnetic field is used for stabilization, it is also 

useful  to  define  an  electromagnetic  Bond  number 

Eχ   as  the  ratio  between  electromagnetic 

and Laplace pressure [76]:

(VII.3) 

where  ∆ε is the contrast in dielectric constant between the two liquids. While 

Eχ  does not 

represent any critical value in the problem, it gives nevertheless important insights on stability 

since 

1χ >  is required for liquid bridge stabilization above classical Rayleigh-Plateau onset.

VII.2 – Optical Stabilization of Liquid Bridges [81] 

The  experimental  setup  used  to  investigate  liquid  bridge  stabilization  under  optical 

radiation  pressure  is  presented  in  Figure  VII.2.  A  glass  capillary  is  immersed  in  the  optical 

cell. Its size is chosen so as to be located within the lower fluid phase 

1Φ  when the mixture is 

59

separated.  This  capillary  plays  the  role  of  the  two  rigid  boundaries  used  to  fix  the  bridge 

length.  As  the  upper  fluid  phase 

2Φ   wets  glass  better  than 

1Φ ,  we  used  the  unavoidable 

wetting films that coat the capillary as disconnected reservoirs to form a bridge. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure  VII.2:  Schematics  of  laser-sustained  liquid  bridge  experiment  for 

T T .  A  glass 

> C

capillary  of  well-defined  height  (100  or  200  µm)  stays  at  the  bottom  of  the  cell  in  the  less 

refractive phase Φ1 . Its surface is coated by a wetting film of the most refractive phase Φ2  

that is deformed by the radiation pressure of a focused beam propagating vertically from Φ1  

to Φ2 . 

In  a  second  step,  we  use  the  general  properties of radiation  pressure  effects on fluid 

interfaces to deform these wetting films and form a liquid column (Figure VII.3). As interface 

deformations  driven  by  radiation  pressure  are  always  directed  towards  the  less  refractive 

liquid  (in  our  case 

1Φ ),  deformations  of  both  wetting  layers  stand  face-to-face.  They  are 

disjoined at low power. The formation of a stable liquid bridge is then ensured by the fact that 

the lower deformation can become unstable if  P P↑>

. Two typical examples of liquid bridge 

formation in a  100 µm  capillary by radiation pressure are presented in Figure VII.3. The first 

example  (

T T

C

=

6  K

, 

ω =

15.3 µm

)  illustrates  a  situation  where  the  final  aspect  ratio  is 

close to the classical instability onset  Λ π= . The second one (

15 K

, 

ω =

3.9 µm

) 

is  chosen  so  as  to  also  show  both  the  tether  formation  on  the  upper  deformation  and  the 

destabilization  of  the  lower  interface.  In  this  case,  final  aspect  ratio  is 

12.5Λ=

,  i.e.  well 

60

above  any  already  published  data.  We  should  notice  that  interface  deformation  by  a 

downward  beam  leads  exactly  to  the  same  final  result,  except  that  now  interface  instability 

occurs on the upper deformation. Liquid bridge formation is thus completely independent of 

the direction of propagation.

To  further  characterize  these  laser-sustained  liquid  columns,  we  analyzed  the

All  the  data  correspond  to  stabilized  columns  of  aspect  ratio  larger  than  that  given  from 

Rayleigh-Plateau criterion. Figure VII.4 shows that  Λ does not vary with  (

To perform an experimental investigation of the liquid bridge stability, we define an

Using  Burcham  and  Saville  procedure  [76],  we  first  measured  the  beam  power  P(cid:132)  

( χ(cid:132) )  required  to  form  an  almost  cylindrical  bridge.  Then,  the  beam  power  is  lowered  until 

62

reaching  bridge  pinch-off  at  P(cid:84)   ( χ(cid:84) ).  The  results,  corresponding  to  the  extreme  (

investigated,  are  presented  in  Figure  VII.5.  Stabilization  and  pinching  of  the  liquid  bridge 

correspond  to  well  different  values  of 

optχ .  χ(cid:132)   and  χ(cid:84)   are  also  independent  of  (

. 

This feature can be retrieved by expressing 

optχ  as function of  P↑ . Considering the general 

expression  of  P↑   [68],  or  its  simplified  expression  close  to  the  critical  point  (Eq.  VI.8)  for 

fluids of close composition,

Consequently, as  P

P↑≥(cid:132)

 by definition of  P↑ , and 

R ω≈
0

 according to Figure VII.4, 

we recover the fact that  χ(cid:132)  should take values close to  4 , as illustrated in Figure VII.5. On 

the other hand,  χ(cid:84)  is  significantly smaller than  χ(cid:132)  due to the fact that the optical guiding 

within the bridge locally increases field intensity and induces a feedback on the liquid column 

stability [82]. As already demonstrated by Burcham and Saville in the context of liquid bridge 

stability under electric field, the dimensionless number  χ, in our case 

optχ , abstract the main 

features determining bridge stability, even if the stabilization mechanism remains unknown. 

A naïve view consists in saying that first there is no radiation pressure coupling acting on a 

surface  of  a  beam  centered  cylindrical  liquid  column.  Then,  radiation  pressure  is  always 

directed outward because the index of refraction of the column is by definition larger than that 

of  the  surrounding  fluid.  So,  any  bridge  pinching  is  automatically  balanced  by  radiation 

pressure; the more the pinching, the more the contribution of the radiation pressure.

VII.3 – Liquid Bridges of Super Large Aspect Ratio Formed by Liquid Jets 

Although  the  liquid  bridges  presented  in  the  preceding  subsection  were  stabilized 

between  two  rigid  boundaries  (the  edges  of  a  capillary),  we  can  also  form  liquid  columns 

between the liquid meniscus and the bottom of the experimental cell. Indeed, as illustrated in 

Figure  VI.12,  the  jet  length  is  controlled  by  the  incident  beam  power.  Thus,  as  our 

experimental optical cell is two millimeters high and the meniscus located in the middle due 

to near criticality, it should be possible to connect the liquid jet to the bottom of the face of 

the  cell  and  to  form  a  liquid  column  of  super  large  aspect  ratio.  As  such  strategy  seems 

obvious  from  Figure  VI.12  for  increasing  beam  powers,  we  instead  illustrate  this  liquid 

column  formation  dynamically,  by  choosing  a  beam  power  larger  than  P↑   ( P 1750 mW

). The dynamics is presented in Figure VII.6. It can be seen that twenty seconds 

(generally a few tens of seconds) are required to connect the jet to the wetting film that coats 

the  bottom  window.  As  already  observed  in  Figure  VI.12  droplets  born  at  the  tip  of  the

VIII – Application to Adaptative Optics and Laser Microfluidics 

We already showed in Section V that linear interface deformations could be used for 

soft  lensing  with  large  variations  in  accessible  focal  distances.  The  nonlinear  regime  in 

deformation,  particularly  optically  driven  liquid  jetting,  offers  an  even  wider  range  of 

application since hydrodynamics starts to couple with light propagation. One major point here 

 

65

is  that,  contrary  to  electro-hydrodynamics  where  micrometric  features  are  difficult  to 

implement, these are natural length scales in "opto-hydrodynamics".  

VIII.1 - Adaptative Optics 

Beyond soft lensing, the liquid columns stabilized by radiation pressure can be viewed 

as appealing structures for optical guiding. Indeed, as the index of refraction of the columns is 

necessarily larger than that of the surrounding fluid, laser beam is automatically captured by 

total reflection and guided within the liquid medium. This light confinement is dynamically 

illustrated in Figure VIII.1 over its entire development, i.e. from soft lensing ( = −

1 1.5 s ) to 

t

jetting ( = −

2 16  s ) and finally laser guiding ( =

t

t

19 22 s ). The final liquid fiber length is 

−

455 µm .

3.47 µm ,  =P 470 mW , and (

T T

)
=C

4 K . The liquid fiber length is  455 µm . 

This laser self-guiding is also efficient in smaller liquid bridges as illustrated in Figure 

VIII.2a, where a liquid column of aspect ratio 

14Λ=

 is stabilized with a glass capillary of 

height  200 µm .

films  are  destabilized,  intercept  and  form  a  wedge.  The  directions  of  propagation  of  each 

beam (ω =0

3.5 µm , =P 800 mW ) are indicated by the arrows.  

One  can  therefore  put  forward  the  concept  of  liquid  step-index  optical  fibre,  which 

provides a very new approach towards self-induced waveguiding. Indeed, contrarily to optical 

adaptative waveguides written by photopolymerisation [83] or laser damage in glasses [84], 

liquid fibres are non-permanent. They are thus completely reconfigurable. The laser creates its 

own  channel  that  is  automatically  optimised  to  its  waist  and  power  as  illustrated  in  Figure 

VIII.3, where adaptation to incident beam power is clearly observed.

ω =0

3.47 µm   and  (

)
=C

4 K .  The  liquid  fiber  length  is  334 µm .  As  demonstrated  by 

the emission of droplets from liquid jets, note that hydrodynamic flow still persists within the 

liquid columns as illustrated by the fluid accumulation at their feet.  

These tunable optical fibres can furthermore be oriented in any direction by tilting the 

exciting beam. Figure VIII.2b gives an example of such an inclined liquid bridge stabilized by 

a laser beam propagating obliquely. Even more surprising are artificial structures such as the 

stable  liquid  elbow  created  in  a  two-laser  beams  configuration  and  presented  in  Figure 

VIII.2c.  Optically  induced  liquid  columns  are  thus  particularly  efficient  to  control  beam 

propagation  or  to  optimise  light  coupling  devices  because  self-adaptation  considerably 

reduces the sensitivity to precise mechanical alignments of the optical components used. 

VIII.2 – Laser Microfluidics 

Aside optical guiding, the liquid jets and columns stabilized by radiation pressure can 

be  viewed  as  three  dimensional  microfluidic  devices  with  "soft"  wall  because  liquid  is 

transported  from  the  upper  liquid  phase  when  P P↑≥

,  i.e.  above  interface  instability  onset. 

Two types of micro-flow can be generated: droplet flow and pipe flow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68

 

As illustrated dynamically in Figure VIII.4, droplets are continuously generated at the 

tip of a stationary jet. Moreover, since the index of refraction of the droplet is larger than that 

of  the  surrounding  fluid,  the  beam  automatically  traps  them.  This  brings  directionality  in 

droplet emission and transport that can be actuated by tilting the beam as illustrated in Figure 

VIII.2b.  Finally,  at  fixed  (

T T−

)C

  and 

0ω ,  the  droplet  flow  rate  can  be  controlled  by  the 

incident beam power. Consequently, contrary to other methods [85], this optical approach of 

microfluidics provides droplets that are directly produced within the chosen micrometric size 

in  a  contact  less  way  without  further  processing.  Also,  as  droplets  are  produced  in  three 

dimensions  from  a  channel  that  can  be  controlled  in  size  by  the  beam,  no  particular 

microfluidic device is required to manage the droplet flow. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Figure VIII.4: Continuous droplet emission and trapping from a jet of stationary length. Note 

the regularity in flow rate and the relative monodispersity of the induced droplets. The time 

delay  between  two  pictures  is  1 s   and  the  jet  length  is  330 µm .  Control  parameters  are 

(

T T
−

)
=C

6  K , ω =0

3.5 µm , and 

P P
↑=

=

490 mW . 

On the other hand, liquid flow within the jet persists when it reaches the bottom face 

of the cell and forms a liquid bridge. This is illustrated in Figure VIII.3, were accumulation of 

liquid on the bottom window of the cell is clearly observed. This means that laser-sustained 

liquid bridges behave as micro-pipes that can be used to transfer fluid from one reservoir to 

69

another.  One  even  more  surprising  fact  is  that  the  micro-pipe  section  can  be  actuated 

continuously by varying the incident beam power (see Figure VIII.3). 

 

Finally, let us note that liquid columns are unstable in classical conditions. As column 

breaking  generally  leads  to  at  least  bimodal  droplet  distributions,  often  called  droplets  and 

satellites  [2]  (see  the  left  picture  of  Figure  VIII.5,  the  important  drawback  for  microfluidic 

applications is control over micro-jet fission to form a regular assembly of micro-droplets [86, 

87]. On the other hand, for applications motivated by fluid transport alone annular flows are 

much more efficient than droplet flows, even if the first situation is difficult to implement due 

to the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Since radiation pressure of laser waves is able to prevent 

column  breaking,  it  becomes  possible  to  reverse  the  microfluidic  approach  in  order  to 

transform  a  bubbly  flow  into  an  annular  flow.  This  process  is  dynamically  illustrated  in 

Figure  VIII.5.  Starting  from  a  linear  assembly  of  well-separated  droplets,  the  radiation 

pressure  deforms  droplets  and  forces  them  to  coalesce  transforming  the  initial  droplet 

assembly into a liquid column.

IX – Conclusion and Prospects 

 

70

The main purpose of this review was to theoretically and experimentally explore fluid 

interface  deformation  driven  by  the  optical  radiation  pressure  of  a  continuous  laser  wave. 

Using  near-critical  liquid-liquid  interfaces,  to  strongly  reduce  surface  tension  and  enhance 

radiation pressure, we validated a universal description of the process. 

We also investigated nonlinear regimes in deformation. Asides surprising stable tether 

shapes,  we  have  presented  a  new  electromagnetic  instability  mechanism  of  fluid  interfaces 

driven by continuous laser wave. The very good agreement observed between measurements 

and expectations demonstrates the universality of this nonlinear process. The resulting jet is 

also  expected  to  occur  quite  universally  and  its  regularity,  as  well  as  that  of  the  produced 

micro-droplets,  should  be  promising 

in  microfluidics  and  electromagnetic  spraying 

techniques.  
 

We  finally  extended  this  investigation  on  nonlinear  behaviors  to  the  formation  of 

stable  liquid  columns.  While  the  results  presented  here  were  obtained  with  a  single  laser 

beam,  the  method  could  easily  be  extended  to  a  parallel  approach  by  forming  liquid-bridge 

patterns  or  adaptative  liquid  gratings  by  tailoring  the  intensity  distribution  with  interfering 

pump beams.  

 

Even if we try to give an extended view of laser-induced fluid interface deformation, 

most  of  its  theoretical  description,  particularly  in  the  nonlinear  regime,  is  still  missing.  For 

example, we did not explain the observed tether shape of the deformation. An investigation of 

liquid  jet  properties  is  also  missing.  The  main  reason  is  linked  to  the  complex  nonlinear 

coupling between a mobile and deformable interface and a laser beam as the interface adapts 

its  position  to  optical  excitation.  Also,  we  did  not discuss dynamical behaviors, even in  the 

linear  regime  in  deformation.  Even  if  we  do  have  some  results  on  this  important  aspect, 

particularly for applications, they are too incomplete to be developed within a general scheme. 

Nevertheless, we hope that our exhaustive presentation of the "static" manifestations 

of  a  liquid  interface  under  the  radiation  pressure  of  a  laser  wave  will  promote  an  optical 

approach to interface actuation and, to build microfluidic devices with optical forces [88] or, 

conversely,  to  anticipate  new  optical  micro-systems  based  on  microfluidics  [89]  for  flow 

guiding and light coupling applications.

Abstract 

We studied the step dynamics during crystal sublimation and growth 
in  the  limit  of  fast  surface  diffusion  and  slow  kinetics  of  atom  attachment-
detachment  at  the  steps.  For  this  limit  we  formulate  a  model  free  of  the 
quasi-static approximation in the calculation of the adatom concentration on 
the terraces at the crystal surface. Such a model provides a relatively simple 
way  to  study  the  linear  stability  of  a  step  train  in  a  presence  of  step-step 
repulsion  and  an  absence  of  destabilizing  factors  (as  Schwoebel  effect, 
surface electromigration etc.). The central result is that a critical velocity of 
the  steps  in  the  train  exists  which  separates  the  stability  and  instability 
regimes.  Instability  occurs  when  the  step  velocity  exceeds  its  critical  value

atomic  site  at  the  surface,  and  the  energy  of  step-step  repulsion  is 

U =

where  l   is  the  interstep  distance.  Integrating  numerically  the  equations  for 
the  time  evolution  of  the  adatom  concentrations  on  the  terraces  and  the 
equations  of  step  motion  we  obtained  the  step  trajectories.  When  the  step 
velocity  exceeds  its  critical  value  the  plot  of  these  trajectories  manifests 
clear space and time periodicity (step density compression waves propagate 
on  the  vicinal  surface).  This  ordered  motion  of  the  steps  is  preceded  by  a 
relatively short transition period of disordered step dynamics. 
 
1. Introduction 

Crystal  sublimation  takes  place  via  detachment  of  atoms  from  the 
steps that exist at the vicinal surfaces. These atoms migrate on the terraces 
and eventually leave the crystal surface by desorption. Some of the adatoms 
can  attach  again  to  the  elementary  steps  but  the  number  of  atoms 
reintegrated into the crystal is smaller than the number of atoms leaving the 
steps. As a result the steps move to the direction of the higher terraces.  In 
general, the rate of the motion of a given step depends on the widths of the 
two  neighbouring  terraces.  In  the  simplest  case  of  perfectly  regular  step 
distribution all steps move at the same rate since all terraces have the same 
width. The step dynamics is extremely simple. 

 

In  reality,  however,  the  steps  are  deviated  from  their  perfectly  regular 
positions.  Intuitively,  one  expects  these  deviations  to  decrease  and 
eventually  vanish  during  the  crystal  sublimation  because  of  the  repulsion 
between the steps, i.e. the step flow is expected to be stable. Actually, in the 
absence of both Ehrlich- Schwoebel effect and drift of adatoms there is no 
physical  ground  for  step  bunching  instability.  One  should  note,  however, 
that this is true as long as the step velocity depends only on the width of the 
neighbouring terraces in the given moment, which means that the impact of 
the  “history”  of  the  terraces  is  neglected.  To  make  clear  this  point  some 
comments are necessary. For simplicity we consider the limit of fast surface 
diffusion  and  slow  attachment-detachment  at  the  steps.  In  this  limit  the 
adatom concentration is constant over the terrace. This concentration is low 
when  the  terrace  is  large  because  the  atoms  detached  from  the  two  steps 
spread over the large area of the terrace and, on the other hand, many atoms 
are lost by desorption from the large terrace. That is why “the history” of the 
terrace is essential. The adatom concentration depends not only on the width 
of the terrace in the moment but on its “past” as well. If the terrace was large 
in the “past” the adatom concentration is low. In contrast, the concentration 
is  high  if  the  terrace  was  small  in  the  “past”.  This  effect  is  completely 
neglected by the steady state treatment of the adatom concentration. On the 
other  hand  this  effect  provides  a  physical  ground  for  oscillations  of  the 
terrace  width.  To  verify  this  statement  it  is  reasonable  to  go  beyond  the 
steady state treatment of the adatom concentration on the terraces. 

Here, one should note the efforts of Ghez et al [1] and Keller et al [2] 
to clarify the stability of a step flow in the more complex situation when the 
surface  diffusion  of  the  adatoms  is  not  assumed  to  be  very  fast.      Their 
mathematical  treatment  is  more  sophisticated  than  the  original  Burton, 
Cabrera and Frank theory [3] in the sense that the quasi-static approximation 
is  replaced  by  a  Stefan-like  problem  for  moving  steps.  This  approach  is 
relevant  for  the  physical  situation  where  the  kinetics  of  crystallization  (or 
evaporation  of  a  crystal)  is  controlled  by  the  relatively  slow  surface 
diffusion. The results obtained in [2] show a train of fast moving steps to be 
unstable.  The  treatment  in  [1,  2],  however,  neglects  the  step-step  repulsion 
which is an important stabilizing factor. 

Our aim here is to study the stability of the step flow in a presence of 
step-step  repulsion.  Since  the  case  of  fast  surface  diffusion  and  relatively 
slow  attachment-detachment  kinetics  at 
treat 
mathematically such a model provides a relatively simple way to study the 
linear  stability  of  a  step  train.  Last  not  least  this  model  can  be  easily 
generalized  to  account  for  a  drift  of  the  adatoms  as  well  as  for  the 
transparency  of  the  steps.  One  should  keep  in  mind,  however,  that  the 
applicability  of  this  model  is  limited  to  the  regime  characterized  by  fast 
surface  diffusion  and  slow  kinetics  at  the  steps.  The  conclusions  are 

the  steps 

is  easy 

to 

 

definitely invalid in all those processes of sublimation and growth, which are 
controlled by slow surface diffusion. 

The  model  of  crystallization  (evaporation)  controlled  by  relatively 
slow  attachment-detachment  kinetics  at  the  steps  has  an  interesting  non-
linear dynamics which we study by numerical integration of the equations of 
step motion coupled with the equations describing the time evolution of the 
adatom  concentration  on  the  terraces.  The  step  dynamics  clearly  manifests 
space and time periodicity (see Fig.1) appearing after some transition time.

Going  back  to  the  equation  (1)  we  see  that  it  has  a  clear  physical

To  obtain  the  final  form  of  the  set  of  differential  equations  (1)  and  (3)  we 
should account for the contribution of the step-step interaction energy to the 
local chemical potential. The entropic and stress-mediated repulsion between

4. Linear stability during growth 

In  a  presence  of  non-zero  deposition  rate  R   an  additional  term 
appears  in  the  right  hand  side  of  eq.  (8).  Because  of  the  dimensionless 

variables used in Eq.(8)  this term reads 

 where 

c

=

st

.  Obviously, 

when  the  deposition  rate  has  its  equilibrium  value 

  one  obtains

We study the non-linear dynamics of the steps at a vicinal surface by 
numerical  integration  of  the  equations  (8)  and  (9)  describing  the  time 
evolution  of  the  terrace  widths  and  the  adatom  concentrations.  The  set  of 
equations  (8)  and  (9)  involves  2N  variables  because  we  use  circling 
boundary  conditions 
.  Since  only  the  terrace  widths 
cN =+
iη   (i=1,  2,…N)  are  experimentally  observable  we  shall  plot  the  calculated 
data for the terrace widths only. To avoid overlapping of the plots 
 we

Fig.  4.  Step  trajectories  in  a  frame  moving  with  the  first  step.  The  model 
parameters are the same in Fig. 5. 
 
Integrating the set of equations (8) and (9) and plotting the step trajectories 
in the way described above we obtained a variety of interesting patterns. It is 
interesting  to  compare  the  space  periodicity  manifested  in  Fig.5  with  the 
predictions  of  the  linear  stability  analysis.  For  the  most  unstable  mode  we 
use  eq.(28)  to  obtain

and 
one we get from the numerical integration. The reason for this discrepancy is 
probably  due  to  the  fact  that  the  numerical  integration  reproduce  the  step 
dynamics in the non-linear regime.    
 
It  is  essential  to  note  that  the  wavelength 
  and  the  period  of  the 
compression waves depend on the initial configurations of the terraces at the 
vicinal surface.

For instance, Fig.5 shows terrace widths (the quantities

6. Conclusion 

18=pn

We  studied  the  step  dynamics  at  vicinal  surfaces  during  crystal 
sublimation and growth in absence of any destabilizing factors as Schwoebel 
barrier,  electromigration  of  adatoms,  etc.  The  central  result  of  our  work  is 
that  a  critical  velocity  of  the  steps  in  the  train  exists  which  separates  the 
stability  and  instability  regimes.  Instability  occurs  when  the  step  velocity

usual  step  bunching  where  the  average  bunch  size  increases  with  the 
sublimation  time.  Integrating  numerically  the  equations  for  the  adatom 
concentrations  and  the  motion  of  the  steps  we  observed  step  density 
compression  waves  propagating  at  the  vicinal  surface  of  the  crystal.  It  is 
interesting to note that the wave length as well as the frequency depend on 
the average size of the initial fluctuations in the terraces widths distribution. 
These waves are, in fact, small bunches of equal size. These small bunches 

 

do not coalesce and their size do not increase with the time of sublimation or 
growth.  

The  natural  question  is  –  what  is  the  physical  reason  for  this 
instability.  We  think  the  compression  waves  exist  because  the  adatom 
concentration  depends  not  only  on  the  width  of  the  terrace  in  the  given 
moment but on the “past” of the terrace as well. If the terrace was large in 
the “past” the adatom concentration is low. In contrast, the concentration is 
high  if  the  terrace  was  small  in  the  “past”.  This  effect  can  be  accurately 
accounted  for  only  by  non-steady  state 
the  adatom 
concentration on the terraces. This is what we did in this paper for   the limit 
of fast surface diffusion and slow kinetics of atom attachment-detachment at 
the steps.

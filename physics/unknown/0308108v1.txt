We  report  a  compact  (<20cm3),  robust  source  for  producing  a  bright  flux  of  cold 

atoms, which can be loaded efficiently into a magnetic guide. A continuous flux of 

up to 8 x 109 87Rb atoms/s have been produced from this 2D+ vapor cell MOT. The 

flux had a divergence of 12.5 mrad and velocity could be controlled in the range 2-

15  m/s.  This  flux  was  coupled  continuously  into  a  magnetic  guide  with  high

Introduction 

In order to probe the macroscopic quantum properties of dilute atomic gases, ultra-high 

vacuum conditions are required to minimize deleterious environmental interactions. This 

contrasts  with  the  high  background  vapor  pressure  required  to  collect  large  numbers  of 

cold  atoms.  Therefore  it  is  desirable  to  have  a  region  with  high  background  pressure 

dedicated  to  producing  a  continuous  flux  of  atoms,  which  can  then  be  coupled  into  an 

ultra-high vacuum region. 

This  approach  has  been  very  successful  for  the  production  of  cold  atomic  beams,  in 

particular using Zeeman slowers [1] and vapor cells [2]. Zeeman slowers produce a large 

flux,  but  with  a  high  mean  velocity  and  potential  issues  with  size,  complexity,  stray 

magnetic fields and the use of light along the atomic beam axis. To produce a cold and 

collimated flux, secondary cooling of the output of a Zeeman slower is required, adding 

further complexity. Vapor cells trade off flux for a lower mean velocity, but with similar 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al.  3 

flux density and a greater flexibility in design. It is worth noting that the density of the 

flux  from  all  these  sources  is  typically  within  an  order  of  magnitude  and  therefore  the 

choice  of  source  is  primarily  determined  by  the  requirements  of  the  downstream 

experiment. 

The  goal  of  this  work  was  to  produce  a  compact,  robust  source  for  loading  magnetic 

guides  efficiently.  This  requires  a  bright  source  of  cold  atoms  with  a  low  velocity  and 

narrow  spread,  qualities  best  matched  to  a  vapor  cell  design.  The  three  most  common 

vapor cell designs are the two dimensional magneto-optical trap (2D MOT) [3], the 2D+ 

MOT  [4]  and  the  low-velocity  intense  source  (LVIS)  [5].  A  2D  MOT,  where  a  two 

dimensional quadrupole magnetic field is used in conjunction with optical cooling along 

the  two  orthogonal  axes  to  the  flux,  is  attractive  when  light  along  this  axis  is  a 

disadvantage, but it does not significantly reduce or narrow the velocity distribution along 

the  flux  axis.  Both  the  2D+  MOT  and  LVIS  designs  use  cooling  and  radiation  force 

imbalance  along  the  flux  axis  to  produce  a  slow  and  narrow  velocity  distribution 

significantly to the several meters per second range, using a two-dimensional and three-

dimensional quadrupole magnetic field respectively. To maximize the capture in velocity-

volume  space  and  the  coupling  efficiency  of  the  flux  from  the  vapor  cell  into  the  2D 

magnetic field of a magnetic guide, a 2D+ MOT design was chosen. 

There  is  significant  interest  in  magnetic  guides  for  a  number  of  applications  from 

nonlinear optics [6,7] to interferometry [8,9] and the generation of degenerate states [10,11]. 

The design of the magnetic guide used here has been previously reported and shown to be 

an efficient and flexible design [12]. Previously our guides have been loaded in-situ from 

a hot background and consequently had a limited trap lifetime and could not be used to 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al.  4 

continuously  load  a  magnetostatic  trap.  Elsewhere  a  number  of  other  approaches  have 

been used to load magnetic guides [13], though issues with heating, poor efficiency and 

lack of optical access have limited their widespread implementation. More recently there 

has been a concerted effort to efficiently inject a continuous flux into a magnetic guide 

using low velocity, bright beams to address these applications [14,15]. 

In  this  article  we  report  the  construction  and  optimization  of  a  simple,  compact,  robust 

2D+  vapor  cell  MOT  with  efficient  coupling  of  the  flux  into  a  magnetic  guide.  This 

scheme provides a model for loading atoms in a dark state into a magnetic guide with the 

future  goal  of  investigating  transport  and  evaporative  cooling  of  the  atoms  within  the 

guide. The primary goal of this work therefore is to inject as high a starting density into 

the guide as possible with a low, controllable velocity and narrow spread. 

Setup 

Figure  1  illustrates  the  experimental  setup.  A  25x25x67mm  standard  quartz  cell  was 

divided in two equal sections by a 25x25x3mm gold mirror. In the center of the mirror a 

1.25mm diameter hole was drilled to connect the vapor cell in the front half of the cell 

with the magnetic guide in the rear half, each half with a volume of less than 20cm3. 

Two rubidium getter ovens provided a simple, compact, controllable method for varying 

the background rubidium density between 107-1010 atoms/cm3 in the front half of the cell. 

The base pressure of the system was 3 x 10-9 mbar created by a 100 liter/s turbo pump, 

and rose to 8 x 10-8 mbar on the UHV side of the cell when the getters were operating at 

maximum current. To form the 2D+ MOT, a two dimensional quadrupole magnetic field 

was  created  by  four  coils  wrapped  around  the  cell.  These  coils  also  provided  direct 

heating  of  the  vapor  cell,  preventing  rubidium  from  condensing  on  the  cell  walls  and 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al.  5 

enabling  higher  vapor  pressures.  The  two  transverse,  circularly-polarised  beams  were 

retro-reflected using right-angle prisms fixed to the cell using optical cement, making the 

design more simple and robust. The third beam along the axis of the atomic flux, with a 

shadow  mask  for  the  region  of  the  hole  was  reflected  by  the  gold  mirror  to  provide 

optical molasses in the longitudinal direction. A separate 1mm-diameter “pushing beam” 

co-propagating  with  the  flux  was  overlapped  with  hole  to  provide  a  way  of  controlling 

the flux through the hole. A counter-propagating “retarding beam” of the same size was 

also used for flux control. The beam size was chosen to be smaller than the hole size to 

avoid interaction with the hole and to extract only the coldest atoms from the 2D+ MOT. 

Using  separate  pushing  and  retarding  beams  enhances  the  control  of  the  flux  produced 

over conventional LVIS and 2D+ MOT designs through the choice of the size, intensity 

and detuning of these beams. Both beams were linearly polarized to aid manipulation and 

measurement,  however  to  reach  much  lower  velocities  or  if  a  magnetic  field  or  field 

gradient is used along the flux axis then circularly-polarised light can be advantageously 

used.  

The  magnetic  guide  was  composed  of  four  mµ-metal  foils  (25x7x0.5mm)  with  3mm 

spacing between them and thirty turns of kapton wire around them. A 0.5mm thick gold-

coated silicon wafer was cut to size and placed on top to complete  the  magneto-optical 

design [12]. The surface of the wafer was 3mm below the center of the hole leading from 

the vapor cell, illustrated in the inset of Figure 1. The flux was measured experimentally 

via on-resonance absorption 5mm and 15mm after the hole on the magnetic guide side of 

the experiment. The visible length of the guide was limited to 20mm by mounting of the 

components.

Vapor Cell Optimization 

The flux out of the vapor cell can never be greater than the loading rate into the MOT, 

though it can of course be much less.  The loading rate into the MOT can be increased by 

increasing the capture velocity and capture volume of the MOT, and/or by increasing the 

background vapor in the cell.   Not all atoms successfully loaded into the MOT can be 

transported out of the cell, so optimization of the MOT loading rate does not necessarily 

optimize  the  flux.  For  example,  though  the  loading  rate  increases  linearly  with 

background pressure, the flux out does not because collisions due to the background gas 

prevent atoms loaded into the MOT from being transferred out of the cell. In addition, for 

a given density in the MOT, the flux out increases with increasing velocity, but at high 

velocities  the  atoms  are  transported  out  of  the  2D+  MOT  region  faster  than  they  are 

captured, so the MOT density and beam density decreases with increasing flux velocity at 

high velocities. Finally, the loading into the magnetic guide may not be optimized at the 

parameters  that  provide  the  largest  flux  out  of  the  vapor  cell.  For  our  application  it  is 

important to optimize the parameters for maximum flux density.  

The first parameter which can be easily considered is the background vapor pressure. For 

a flux velocity of 10m/s, background collisions would start to limit the flux density above 

a  background  density  of  1x1010  atoms/cm3.  The  optimum  flux  density  for  this  cell  was 

obtained  at  background  pressures  of  1x1010  atoms/cm3  in  agreement  with  the  measured 

flux velocity of 11m/s. 

Experimentally,  there  is  a  trade-off  between  capture  volume  and  capture  velocity  for  a 

fixed  laser  power.  Simple  MOT  modeling  indicates  that  the  loading  efficiency  can  be 

maximized  when  the  intensity  of  each  beam  is  approximately  ten  times  the  saturation 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al.  7 

intensity. For the 300mW available from the tapered amplifier used in these experiments, 

this  equates  to  beam  diameters  of  35-23mm,  matching  the  size  of  the  cell  windows. 

Figure 2 illustrates how the flux density varies with beam size and intensity with the other 

experimental  parameters  optimized.  The  transverse  light  intensity  does  not  significantly 

affect  the  flux  velocity,  but  the  density  peaks  around  a  transverse  beam  intensity  of 

11mW/cm2. The longitudinal light intensity, including the pushing beam, clearly controls 

the flux velocity, with a peak in the density similar to the transverse beams. From Figure 

2b) the flux scales as expected as the two-thirds power of the diameter of the beams. This 

result  indicated  we  have  efficient  capture  over  the  whole  cell  size  to  within  two 

millimeters  of  the  cell  wall,  that  we  are  not  density  limited  and  that  collisions  with  the 

background are not a significant source of loss for the cold atomic flux.  

Optimization  of  the  magnetic  field  determines  the  ideal  laser  detuning  and  hence  the 

maximum capture velocity from the hot background vapor. If the magnetic field gradient 

is  too  small,  then  atoms  will  not  be  sufficiently  damped  to  produce  an  intense  atomic 

beam, whereas too high a gradient limits the distance out to which capture will take place. 

To  maintain  good  damping  of  atoms  in  the  magneto-optic  trap,  the  gradient  of  the 

magnetic  field  needs  to  be  at  least  10G/cm.  The  optimum  laser  detuning  is  typically 

around two linewidths, limiting the capture radius to 8mm for these parameters. However 

the maximum capture velocity can be increased by using power broadening to red-shift 

the  optimum  laser  detuning  by  several  linewidths.  By  setting  the  transverse  beam 

intensities to 11mW/cm, the flux density was maximized with a detuning of 30MHz and a 

magnetic  field  gradient  of  21.5G/cm,  giving  efficient  capture  throughout  the  cell. 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al.  8 

Although  not  implemented  here,  the  laser  frequency  can  also  be  scanned  rapidly  to 

broaden the velocity space which can be captured. 

The  hole  size  required  for  coupling  the  atoms  out  of  the  vapor  cell  can  be  found  by 

considering  the  diameter  of  the  cold  atoms  confined  in  the  radial  magnetic  field.  It  is 

desirable that the hole size should match the diameter of the MOT for efficient coupling 

and to minimize hot background collisions beyond the hole.  

This was confirmed experimentally by offsetting the trap center from the axis of the hole 

to form a stable MOT. The resulting cloud was found to have a diameter of 1.4mm and a 

length of 21mm at a magnetic field gradient of 20G/cm, which was reduced to a diameter 

of  1.2mm  and  a  length  of  19mm  at  27G/cm.  The  flux-optimized  values,  used 

subsequently, were measured to be 23G/cm and a laser detuning of 28MHz [Γ=-5.5].  

The choice of hole size is also affected by the transverse temperature of the cold atoms 

because of divergence. However as the longitudinal velocity is approximately two orders 

of magnitude greater than the transverse velocity and the solid angle filtering due to the 

hole  size  (φ=1.25mm  x  3mm),  the  angular  spread  was  expected  to  be  small.  The 

divergence  of  the  flux  after  the  hole  was  measured  to  be  12.5mrad,  equating  to  a 

transverse temperature of 80µK. Increasing the hole size increases the divergence of the 

beam by permitting hotter atoms to escape. There is no significant gain in cold flux when 

the diameter of the hole significantly exceeds that of a stable MOT.  

The scalability of this vapor cell design has also been considered. Increasing the length of 

the  cell  increases  the  path  length  for  an  atom  to  leave  the  vapor  cell,  limiting  the 

background  density  that  can  be  used  before  collisions  limit  the  flux  density.  There  will 

also  be  an  increase  in  the  time  an  atom  spends  on  axis  with  the  hole  where  it  will 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al.  9 

experience  acceleration,  giving  a  higher  average  longitudinal  velocity,  while  giving  a 

slightly  smaller  transverse  velocity.  The  longer  cell  length  will  also  increase  the 

transverse cooling time, permitting a purely 2D MOT to work. Increasing the transverse 

size of the cell will increase the potential capture volume and decrease the effect of the 

walls, but also decrease the magnetic field gradient leading to a larger and hotter flux of 

cold atoms.  Figures  2,  3 and our Monte  Carlo modeling illustrate these points well and 

indicates that ideally we our cell size should be approximately 50% larger than the one 

used, given our laser power and magnetic guide, yielding up to five times more flux.  

 

Flux Control 

Figure 3 shows how the flux density varies with the flux velocity. The flux velocity was 

controlled by changing the intensity ratio between the pushing and retarding beams from 

1:0 to 1:1, corresponding to a reduced acceleration of the atoms in the region of the hole 

and  a  decrease  in  the  velocity.  The  measured  flux  density  achieved  for  different 

background  rubidium  densities  is  plotted,  and  it  is  worth  noting  the  cold  atomic  flux 

density is approximately that of the background hot atoms and there is a linear increase in 

flux  density  with  background  pressure,  indicating  that  background  collisions  are  not 

limiting  the  flux.  When  optimized,  the  maximum  turn-key  flux  density  from  the  vapor 

cell  was  measured  to  be  5.8x108  atoms/cm3  with  a  velocity  of  11±1.5m/s,  and  a 

maximum flux of 8x109 atoms/s at a velocity of 15m/s. This is approximately 50% of the 

optimal  flux  of  1.2x1010atoms/s  from  a  maximum  capture  velocity  of  52m/s  from  a 

background  rubidium  vapor  pressure  of  1x1010  atoms/cm3  in  a  20cm3  capture  volume 

with a fill time of 5ms. The loss in efficiency is attributed to the anisotropy of the diode 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al. 10 

laser’s  intensity  profiles  particularly  for  the  transverse  beams  close  to  the  hole  where 

there  is  mismatch  in  the  light  intensities  due  to  aperturing  of  beams  at  the  edge  of  the 

prisms  as  well  as  a  small  mismatch  in  their  positioning,  causing  transverse  heating  and 

deflection. There is also a loss factor associated  with the hot  background  atoms  exiting 

through the hole due to pumping. Ideally the flux density should increase as the pushing 

force and velocity decrease. However a sharp drop is observed because of the increased 

transit  time  out  of  the  cell  and  the  increased  importance  of  transverse  velocity  and  any 

light force imbalances. If a lower velocity is desirable, then a pair of far-detuned moving 

molasses system could be used instead. 

By  pulsing  the  longitudinal  light  on  axis  with  the  hole,  it  was  found  that  a  pulsed  flux 

could be obtained, as shown in Figure 2a). The peak pulsed flux was four times that of 

the  continuous  flux  with  a  repetition  rate  of  up  to  150Hz  and  up  to  1x107  atoms/pulse. 

The pulsed operation arises because the small cell length and hole size offers extremely 

poor output coupling for a purely 2D MOT when the pushing beam is switched off. When 

the light is switched on, the reservoir of transversely cooled atoms can then be pushed out 

through  the  hole  by  the  pushing  beam.  A  pulsed  flux  is  an  attractive  alternative  for 

loading  a  magnetic  guide  because  it  can  reduce  the  amount  of  stray  light  causing 

decoherence  and  permit  more  efficient  optical  pumping  into  a  trapped  magnetic  state. 

These efficiencies potentially recover the loss in overall flux and a continuous flux in the 

guide can be recovered over time if the longitudinal velocity spread is considered. 

 

The flux velocity is an important experimental parameter in a magnetic guide because too 

low  a  velocity  will  limit  the  flux  available  from  the  vapor  cell  source  and  increase  the 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al. 11 

potential for heating in a continuous beam with an axial temperature gradient; too high a 

velocity  will  require  an  excessively  long  magnetic  guide  for  downstream  experiments. 

Control of the flux velocity was investigated using two methods: by varying the intensity 

of  the  counter-propagating  “retarding  beam”  and  by  frequency  detuning  it  from  the 

28MHz  red-detuned  “pushing  beam”.  Figure  4  illustrates  that  below  the  saturation 

intensity, any counter-propagating light has little effect on the velocity. However as the 

intensity approaches that of the beam propagating in the direction of the flux, the velocity 

of the atoms decreases to 5m/s. 

The  effect  of  detuning  the  counter-propagating  light  was  also  investigated.  A  beam 

matched to the intensity of the propagating beam was detuned in the range –6 to 4 MHz 

using two 40MHz acousto-optic modulators. Accurate velocity control from 2.5 to 7m/s 

could be achieved in this way. In principle must lower velocities can be obtained using 

this  moving  molasses  approach  [10],  however  with  the  relatively  high  background 

pressure  used  here,  there  was  a  55%  decrease  in  flux  as  the  velocity  was  decreased  to 

2.5m/s. 

Loading a Magnetic Guide 

The  choice  of  hole  size  determined  the  spacing  of  the  foils  used  in  the  magnetic  guide 

(3mm). Modeling of the magnetic fields indicates that the hole size needs to be smaller 

than half the spacing of the foils for efficient transfer between the geometries. 

The inset in Figure 1 illustrates how the flux from the vapor cell  can be used to load a 

magneto-static  trap.  The  first  goal  of  the  loading  process  is  to  separate  the  flux  of  cold 

atoms from the flux of hot background atoms, which also exit the vapor cell through the 

hole.  By  choosing  the  current  directions  in  the  four-foils  used,  the  magnetic  field 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al. 12 

generated reinforced the 2D quadrupole field of the vapor cell MOT. The height of the 

magnetic  field  minimum  was  adjustable  by  changing  the  currents  around  the  foils  to 

produce an axis for the guided flux 0-3mm below the axis of the flux exiting the vapor 

cell. By choosing the lengths and curvature of the mµ-metal foils correctly, edges effects 

can  be  minimized.  In  addition,  the  absence  of  repumper  light  in  the  region  around  and 

through  the  hole  reduces  the  forces  on  the  atomic  flux  as  it  enters  the  magnetic  field 

above the above the guide. A short (5mm long) transverse cooling and repumper section 

5mm  after  the  hole  provides  sufficient  momentum  for  the  cold  atoms  to  make  the 

transition to the magnetic field minimum of the guide but not the residual hot atoms. The 

cooling beam was chosen to be large enough to provide sufficient time for the cold flux 

to  receive  enough  transverse  momentum  to  relocate  and  be  cooled  in  the  axis  of  the 

guide, but short enough not to significantly alter the trajectory of hot atoms also exiting 

the  hole.  This  beam  was  derived  from  the  main  cooling  light  of  the  vapor  cell  and 

therefore  had  the  same  detuning and  the transfer was optimized  with  an  intensity  of  10 

Isat.  

The temporal sequence normally used to efficiently load a magnetic trap from a magneto-

optical trap cannot readily or efficiently be employed here because of the need to define a 

quantisation  axis  and  optically  pump  the  atoms  into  a  low-field  seeking  state.  Using  a 

pulsed  flux  would  remove  these  limitations,  however  it  is  not  clear  the  resulting  flux 

would  be  greater  than  simply  employing  a  depumping  beam  immediately  after  the 

transverse cooling section. By pumping the atoms into the F=1 state, approximately 33% 

of the atoms will end up in the weak-field seeking mf = -1 sublevel and be guided by the 

magnetic guide. 

Compact, Robust Source of Cold Atoms for Efficient Loading of  a Magnetic Guide - Conroy et al. 13 

The  continuous  loading  efficiency  of  the  flux  into  the  magnetic  guide  was  investigated 

with  no  counter-propagating  beam  to  avoid  issues  with  light  scattering.  The  size  of  the 

pushing beam as mentioned earlier was chosen to be smaller than the hole size to push 

out only the coldest atoms and to avoid aperturing, diffraction and light scattering effects 

from the hole. The maximum magnetic field gradient that could be produced by the guide 

was  100G/cm  with  the  minimum  2mm  below  and  0.4mm  transversely  offset  from  the 

flux axis through the hole. This spatial separation between the flux coming through the 

hole and the axis of the guide minimizes the effect of the pushing light on the atoms in 

the  magnetic  guide.  Due  to  spatial  constraints  no  axial  magnetic  holding  field  was 

employed  to  prevent  spin-flips,  however  because  of  the  short  distance  over  which 

detection could be made these were not considered to be a major source of loss. 

The  transfer  efficiency  into  the  guide  was  measured  using  a  second  on-resonant 

absorption  beam  5mm  after  the  transverse  cooling  section.  Along  the  original  flux  axis 

from the vapor cell, this beam measured a depletion of 85%. When adjusted to the height 

of the magnetic field minimum of the guide, 40% of the original continuous flux of atoms 

was  detected,  with  a  density  of  2x109  atoms/cm3.  This  measured  efficiency  is  several 

times  greater  than  other  methods  of  loading  magnetic  guide  [15,16]  and  indeed  is  higher 

than expected in part because the detection zone was not sufficiently far from the loading 

zone  to  guarantee  only  the  magnetically  trapped  atoms  were  detected.  From  an 

approximate calculation however these background atoms contribute no more than 35% 

to  the  measured  signal.  Although  no  significant  heating  of  the  flux  or  change  in  the 

longitudinal velocity was observed, further quantitative measurements of the temperature 

could not be made because of experimental limitations.

Conclusions 

We have demonstrated a compact, turnkey source of cold atoms for efficiently loading a 

magnetic  guide.  A  maximum  continuous  flux  of  8x109  87Rb  atoms/s  with  a  velocity  of 

15±1.5m/s, diameter of 1.25mm and divergence of 12.5mrad has been produced from a 

2D+ vapor cell MOT. This flux was loaded efficiently into a magnetic guide. 

This  technique  can  be  scaled  and  made  more  efficient  to  yield  an  order  of  magnitude 

more  atoms  to  provide  an  attractive  route  to  generating  a  bright,  robust  source  of  cold 

atoms. After this proof of concept, we are developing a longer magnetic guide structure 

into which the atoms can be loaded and characterized more completely, in particular the 

most  efficient  route  to  controlling  the  velocity  and  preparing  the  flux  in  a  magnetically 

trappable state.

Abstract 
 
   We have developed commercial prototypes of sealed gaseous detectors combined with 
CsI photocathodes and/or filled with photosensitive vapors. The rirst results of 
application of these devices for the detection of  flames in daylight conditions and for the 
detection of scintillation lights from noble liquids will be presented. The main conclusion 
from our studies is that for some applications  the sealed UV sensitive gaseous detectors 
have superior performance (higher practical quantum efficiency and better signal to noise 
ratio) than existing commercial UV sensitive detectors. Additionally, they are much 
cheaper.  

 
 
 
 

1.  Introduction 

 
 
    Photosensitive wire chambers  (introduced by Seguinot et al., [1] and Bogomolov et 
al.,[2]) and gaseous detectors with CsI photocathodes ( first developed by Charpak et al., 
[3] and Dangendorf et al., [4]), operating in flushed by gas mode found widespread 
applications in experimental practice. For example, multiwire proportional chambers 
combined with CsI photocathode are under development and testing for  several large -
scale high –energy physics experiments, for example ALICE, HADES and others [5]. 
The main advantages of these detectors are their simplicity and large sensitive area (in 
some cases square meters). There were also some efforts to develop sealed gaseous 
detectors with CsI photocathode (see for example [6,7]) however for high- energy physic 
applications  they had no special advantages over the flushed ones and for this reason did 
not receive any application in high-energy physics experiments yet. 
However, there are other applications which require sealed UV sensitive detectors. 
Examples could be: for the detection of flames in daylight conditions [7], noble liquid 
TPC [8], spectroscopy, synchrotron radiation physics,  biology [9], various security 
devices. 
 

    The main aim of this work is to investigate the possibility of manufacturing sealed UV 
sensitive gaseous detectors with CsI photocathode and/or filled with photosensitive 
vapors at a cost much lower than any other alternative detectors (for example vacuum 
photomultipliers) and evaluating of their efficiency, performance and long-term stability. 
   The abilities of these detectors will be demonstrated on two examples: detection of 
flames in daylight condition and detection of scintillation lights from noble liquids 
 

2.  Set -up for the  Manufacturing and Testing of Sealed Gaseous Detectors 

 
   The- set up for the  manufacturing of sealed gaseous detector is show schematically in 
Fig.1. Essentially, it consists of the detector to be sealed connected to the pump and gas 
systems. The detectors used in this work were stainless steal cylindrical single -wire 
counters (the diameters of the cathode cylinder of 20 and 30 mm, 110mm and 150mm in 
length, diameter of the anode wire was of 0.1mm) with quartz (diameter of the cathode of 
20 mm) or MgF2 windows (diameter of the cathode of 30 mm). The interface between the 
cathode and the anode wire was manufactured from ceramics.  Two types of 
photosensitive detectors were manufactured: with CsI photocathode (see Fig. 2) and filled 
with photosensitive vapors. Gaseous detectors with CsI photocathodes were 
manufactured by the following procedure. First, before the window was mounted, an CsI 
layer was deposited on the inner part of the cylindrical cathode on the surface located 
opposite to the window. The coating with the CsI layer was done at the CERN CsI 
evaporation facility. After this the cylinder was extracted from the evaporation plant and 
the window was attached to the cathode cylinder and sealed thereafter. The total time 
during which the cathode was exposed to air was around one hour. The detector was then 
heated to 65°C and pumped to a vacuum of better than 10-6 Torr for several days. After 
such a step, it was cooled to room temperature and filled with one of the gas mixtures: 
Ar+10%CO2 or Ar+10%CH4 at a total pressure of 1 atm. In the case of the detector filled 
with the photosensitive vapor the window was sealed to the cathode cylinder from very 
beginning. The detector was then  heated to 150°C and pumped to a  vacuum of 10-6 for 
several days. After, the detector was cooled to room temperature and ethylferrocene (EF) 
vapors [10] were introduced. Finally, the detector was filled by Ar+15%CO2 at a total 
pressure of 1atm. 
   The quantum efficiency (QE) at various wavelengths was measured with the help of a 
monohromator (see Fig. 3). The absolute intensity of the light beam which exited the 
monochromator and entered the detector was calibrated in the wavelength interval of 
140-200 nm with the help of an ionization chamber filled with TMAE vapors (the QE of 
TMAE is well known [11]) and in the wavelength interval of 200-300 nm with respect to 
the photodiodes calibrated by Hamamatsu. 
The stability of the manufactured detector was monitored by using a pulse D2 lamp (see 
Fig. 4) having a peak of light emission at 160 nm. The intensity of the pulsed D2 lamp 
was sufficient enough to obtain a clear signal even at gain one and this allowed to 
measure accurately the gain vs. voltage and to monitor the detector efficiency. 
In some control measurements a Hg lamp combined with narrow-band filters having a 
peak of transmission at 200 nm was also used. 
 
 

3. The Results of Some Measurements 
 
   The results of some of our measurements are presented in Figs 5-7.  
   In Fig. 5 are shown the QE vs. wavelength measured for both type gaseous detectors: 
with CsI photocathodes and filled with EF vapors. Comparing the measured QE to the 
values presented in our previous work [13] one can conclude that the quantum efficiency 
of our CsI photocathodes was less by almost a factor of two. We attribute this to the fact 
that or photocathdes were exposed to air for long time - around 1 hour. In contrast, in 
work [13] the photocathdes were transferred to the detector within a few min. The value 
of the QE for the detectors filled with the EF was closed to the one calculated for the 
given length of the detector (150 mm) and the temperature of 22-25°C, which was in the 
laboratory during the measurements (the contribution of the EF absorbed layer was also 
taken in to the account [13]).  
  In Fig. 6 are presented the results of gain measurements. One can see that gains of more 
that 105 were easily achieved. One should note that at gains of more than 3104, photon 
feedback appeared, however at counting rated of less than 104Hz it did not cause any 
special problems (the photon feedback pulses followed for several μs the main pulse and 
in the case of  the integration time of the amplifier of 10 μs were counted as one pulse), 
so that one could operate the detector in photon counting mode until gains of 106 and 
even more.  
   Fig. 7 shows the results of the measurements the stability in time or, to be more precise 
-the evolution of the QE and the gain with time. One should note that the detectors 
mentioned above were manufactured at different times. For example, the “oldest” one 
were the detectors with CsI photocathode and quartz windows; this is why we were able 
to monitor their stability over ~1, 5 year. The detectors with MgF2 windows were 
manufactured only a few months ago and correspondingly in the Fig.7 the results 
obtained during this time interval are presented. One can conclude from this data that a 
rather good stability was achieved for all typed of detectors used in this work  
 
4. Applications and Measurements 
4-1.1 UV Flame and Spark Detectors.  
a) Indoor Applications 
 
   In many applications there is need to detect flame or sparks in daylight conditions, for 
example in houses, plants, storage buildings, etc. Recent studies show that it could be 
very efficiently done with UV sensitive detectors [14]. This is because  most of the 
flames in air, almost independently on their nature, are emitting in the UV region (185-
300 nm ) whereas the lamps used to illuminate rooms and buildings practically do not 
emit in this region due to the strong absorption in glass and other materials used in their 
design. The UV emission from the sun is also is fully blocked by the glass windows. 
Thus one can detect the UV light from flames with extremely high signal to noise ratio. 
There are some commercial detectors which explore this possibility: PMs combined with 
narrow band filters, solid state sensors and gaseous detectors. The cheapest are the 
gaseous detectors [14,15]. The example could be a Hamamatsu sealed gaseous detector 
with the metallic photocathode R2868 [12]. This detector is able to detect small flames in 
daylight conditions without using any filters. In our earlier preliminary experiments it 

was shown that much  higher sensitivity for the  flame detection in fully illuminated 
rooms could be achieved not  with pure metallic photocathodes but with metallic ones 
covered by photosensitive layers,  particularly with CsTe (see for example [16]). 
Unfortunately, CsTe photocathodes are difficult to manufacture and they remains stable 
only in the case of very clean gaseous conditions. As a consequence, the price of such 
sealed gaseous detector is as high as avacuum PM.  
   The fact that CsI photocathode could be exposed to air for 5-10 min without a strong 
loss in their QE dramatically simplifies the manufacturing of the sealed detector. Indeed, 
in contrast to vacuum photomultipliers where the photocathodes are manufacturing at the 
same time as the whole detector, the gaseous detectors with the CsI photocathodes could 
be manufactured in three steps as it was described above: 1) the coating of a metal 
cathode by an CsI layer, 2) assembling the whole detector in the air, 3) pumping, gas 
filling and sealing the detector. For example, one can suggest manufacturing the same 
detector as Hamamatsu R 2868, but with the cathode coated by the CsI layer. Since the 
assembling of the photocathode could be done in air, one can expect that the price of this 
modified device will no be increased by much. 
   One of the aims of this work was to compare the characteristics and the price of our 
sealed gaseous detectors to Hamamatsu R2868. In these comparative studies we used two 
designs of detectors with the CsI photocathodes: one with a quart and the other one with 
an MgF2 window both filled   with Ar+10%CO2 a total pressure of 1atm (see Fig. 2). 
Since Hamamatsu published some data for sensitivity of their devices to small flame 
flames produce by matches and cigarette lighters [12], we performed measurement with 
these flames (see Fig. 8). Some our results are presented in the Table 1. As one can se 
from the data presented, due to the CsI coating our detectors had remarkably high 
sensitivity to the UV radiation emitted by flames and at the same time practically were 
practically not sensitive to the visible light - the feature allowing them to operate without 
any problems in fully illuminated rooms. For example, a flame from a match or a 
cigarette lighter could be easily detected in a fully illuminated room at a distance of more 
than 30 m: the counting rate produced by the match was around 100 Hz, whereas the 
background counting rate (no match) in a fully illuminated room was below few Hz. The 
main conclusion from our measurements was that our detectors were 100- 1000 times 
more sensitive that the Hamamatsu one. 
   The other important advantage of our detectors is that in contrast to the  Hamamatsu 
R2868 sensor our single- wire counters could operate in proportional modes and this 
allowed one to distictinguish  between the signals produced by single photons and a few 
photons arriving almost at the same time. This in turn, allows reliable detection not only 
for quasy stationary flames , but also for the sparks- the feature which could be very 
important for creating a spark monitoring and spark alarm system. 
 
 
b) Outdoor Application 
 
 
   There is also a unique possibility to detect the UV light from the flames outside the 
building in the presence of strong sun light. This is based on the fact that the UV light 
from the sun with the wavelength of λ< 280 nm is fully adsorbed by the ozone in the 

upper layer of the  atmosphere; however on  ground level the atmosphere is transparent 
for this radiation. To be more precise: the atmosphere on the ground level  is transparent 
for the radiation with wavelength of λ >185 nm at short distances from the UV source (up 
to 30-50 m) and transparent for the light with wavelength of λ > 240 nm for long 
distances (kilometers) from the source. This offers a unique possibility to detector the UV 
emission of flames (for example, forest fires) in the wavelength interval of 185-280 nm in 
direct sunlight conditions without any background from the sun. 
   The tests performed by us show that sealed detectors with CsI photocathodes are able to 
detect flames in outdoor conditions, however the background counting rate NCsI  
produced by the sunlight was rather high. This was because the QE of the CsI for λ> 280 
nm is not at real zero (see Fig. 5) whereas the sun’s emission in this spectral interval is 
extremely strong.  As a result the convolution of the sunlight spectrum S(λ) with the CsI 
QE (QCsI)in the spectral interval of 280-500 nm  is not zero either:  

NCsI=280∫500 S(λ)QCsI (λ)dλ > 0. 
Measurements show that even in the presence of weak sunlight (a cloudy day)  NCsI>102. 
Much better results were obtained with the photosensitive sealed detectors filled with EF 
vapors. As one can see from Fig. 5  the QE of the EF (QEF) for λ >200 nm is practically 
zero so one can expect that:  

NEF=280∫500 S(λ)QEF (λ)dλ ~ 0. 
Measurements performed with various flames (see Fig. 9) and at various conditions fully 
confirmed this expectation. As an example Fig.10  shows the counting rate vs. time 
(accumulated each 10 sec) for the detector filled by the EF and exposed to the direct 
sunlight. The mean number of the counts was 2.5 and it remained the same even if the 
detector  was fully shielded from the light. So we attributed this small counting rate to the 
contribution from the cosmic radiation and from spurious pulses. 
   With such low background it was easy to detect small flames in the presence of the 
direct sun light. As an example in Fig. 10 shows the increase of the counting rate in the 
presence of a small flame placed 30 m away from the detector. Note that this was the 
flame produce by alcohol and it was practically invisible by human eye in sunlight 
conditions. 
   Comparison to commercial sensors of UV radiation from flames able to operate in 
sunlight conditions (see for example[14,15]) show that the sensitivity of our detector is at 
least 100 higher. 
   Note that our sealed gaseous detector are not only superior in sensitivity than 
commercially available devices but also  considerably cheaper. 
 
 

4-1.2. UV Detectors for Cryogenic TPCs. 

 
   Obviously, the sealed gaseous detector with CsI photocathodes could be used not only 
for the flame detections, but in many other applications- practically everywhere where 
detection of the UV light  is needed. As an example we will present here the tests 
oriented on the application of our detectors for the noble liquid TPCs [8,17,18]. The key 
element in noble liquid TPCs are UV sensitive photodetectors which record the primary 
scintillation light from the noble liquids and generate the triggering signal to the readout 

system. In some designs, photodetectors are also supposed to detect the secondary 
scintillation light [17,19]. Currently expensive PMs are used for this purpose. 
In our recent experiments  [8,20-22] we have demonstrated that detectors with CsI 
photocathodes flushed by gas detectors are able to operate at cryogenic temperatures and  
detect with a high efficiency the scintillation lights from noble liquids. In spite of 
encouraging preliminary results, flushed by gas detectors have several inconvenient 
features, for example their  working voltage V depends on the  temperature. Certainly for 
the noble liquid TPC applications one would need stable detectors and preferably sealed 
detectors to avoid additional complications associated to the gas systems.  
    In this work for the first time we tested sealed gaseous detectors: single wire counters 
with MgF2 windows filled with Ar+10%CH4 at p=1atm.Tests of these detectors were 
performed with the help of the cryostat described in [22]. As in work [20] inside the 
cryostat a “scintillation” chamber was installed - a gas chamber containing an 241Am 
source and flushed, depending on the measurements,  by Ar or by Xe gases at pressures 
of 1atm (Fig. 11). The alpha particles form the 241Am produced the scintillation light 
which was detected simultaneously by our sealed gaseous detector and by a PM. If 
necessary, the scintillation chamber could be independently cooled to obtain a thin layer 
of LXe coating the surface of the 241Am source.  
    Results obtained so far are very encouraging. As an example Fig.12 shows the gain and 
the QE measured as a function of temperature for the sealed gaseous detector. One can 
see that the gain remained constant and the QE degradeted only slightly. After the 
warming up the detector to room temperature, the QE values returned to their original 
ones. 
   Fig. 13 shows oscillogramms of signals from the sealed gaseous detector and from the 
PM simultaneously detecting scintillation the light from the LXe. One can see that the 
gaseous detector had much better signal to noise ratio. 
The stability of our detectors was monitored at various temperature cycles for the period 
of more than three months; some results are presented in Fig. 7.  
 
5. Conclusions 
 
   The main conclusion from our studies are that the developed by us technology allows to 
manufacture cost effective sealed gaseous detector having high quantum efficiency and 
good stability in time. Developed detectors are in fact gaseous photomultipliers which 
could be used in many other applications such as spectroscopy, biology, various security 
devices and so on. In contrast to commercially available vacuum PMs they are much 
simpler and cheaper and can operate in magnetic fields necessary in some measurements. 
   Note as well,  that 1atm operation  simplifies the feedthrough problems so that the 
detector could be easily made position sensitive( see for example[23,24]).

Tabl.1. Number of counts measured with three different sensors detecting the UV 
radiation from the match placed at different distances from the sensor’s windows. 
One can conclude from these data that our sealed gaseous detector with the  MgF2
window is ∼1152 more sensitive than the Hamamatsu R2868. The gaseous detector with 
the quartz window  is∼ 118 times more sensitive than the Hamamatsu one.

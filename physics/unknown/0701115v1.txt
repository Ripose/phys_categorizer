  This manuscript contains a description and basic principles for observing inaccessible areas 
using low cost, easily deployed equipment. The basic premise is to suspend a tiny video camera 
at an altitude of 10 -200 meters over the area to be surveyed. The TV camera supports at altitude 
by wind or ballom.  The technical challenges regard the means by which the camera is 
suspended.  Such a system may be used by military or police forces, or by civil authorities for 
rescue missions or assessment of natural disasters. The method may be further developed for 
military applications by integrating the surveillance task with deployment of munitions. 
Key words: air observer, air suspended system, low altitude video observer.

1. Introduction.

1.1. Historical Perspective
   From 1993-2000 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) spent 35 millions dollars 
for Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) research. Micro aircraft, no larger than a small bird, are already showing 
promise in reconnaissance roles by flying with video cameras and returning live pictures.  At present time 
the Air Force and Army continue Micro Air Vehicle (MAVs) research and development for assisting 
ground soldiers with non-line-of-sight reconnaissance. Unfortunately, after 10 years of development and 
spending hundreds of millions of dollars, we still do not have a MAV suitable for reliable, sustainable 
close-in surveillance.  The reason is that the MAV method is fundamentally limited for this role.  It is 
impossible to use when the wind is strong.  As fuel capacity is limited, observation times are very limited.  
An enemy can fairly easily see and avoid (or destroy) the MAV because the MAV must flights at low 
altitude when using small, lightweight cameras and optics.  The soldier may require special training for 
control and operation of the MAV, especially if it does not have an autopilot.
  We propose have a method based upon a simple device, which does not have these shortcomings and in 
some cases, may be more efficient than a MAV.
1.2. Short Description of the Micro Air Observer (MAO).
The basic approach for this method is to suspend a very small, essentially invisible, Micro Air Observer 
(MAO) or (SAO) -Suspended Air System at a controlled altitude over an area to be investigated. The 
MAO device includes: (1) aerial support device (kite, air balloon) located at a relatively high altitude (e.g. 
1000 m) which is connected by a thin fiber cable and thin electric wire to anchors (and a battery) located 
at the Earth’s surface; (2) a micro video camera (and microphone) at the low altitude (100-200m) 
connected to the support device by thin fiber cable and wire; (3) support electronics including a 
transceiver, radio control, and small battery; (4) control and observation ground station for the soldier (or 
operator). Optionally, the MAO may also contain a self-destructor.  The entire device may be packaged in 
a canister and dispensed from an aircraft or artillery shell.  Most of the devices required to build the MAO 
exist off-the-shelf and have a combined weight 20-90 grams and volume of 10-50 cubic centimeters. 
  
There are several possible launch methods and conditions for the MAO:
a) The MAO is launched from aircraft.  The aircraft dispenses the MAO canister into a given area 

(fig.1). The canister is opened at a given altitude, the kite (balloon) is opened, the anchor falls on the 
ground and stabilizes the kite (balloon). The kite deploys the camera to the desired altitude and begins 
operation.  The kite may require additional anchors (fig.2) to ensure that the MAO will have the same 
position for any wind direction.  The schematic design of the canister and anchor are shown in figs. 3 
and 4 respectively. Fig.5 show the MAO being launched from an air launched cruise missile.

b) An artillery shell launches the MAO. When the shell flies at an altitude 100-200 meters, the support 

device (parachute) is opened and the MAO is braked (fig.6). When the MAO reaches the ground, it is 
would likely be self-destroyed by a flight termination unit.

speed remains never drops below some threshold value for more than some determinable period of 
time.

If prevailing wind blows towards operator.  The operator deploys the MAO in the direction of the 
desired site. At the apogee of the trajectory the brake parachute is opened, the MAO, connected to the 
shell by fiber, is slowed. The shell continues on its trajectory and falls behind the enemy location. The 
shell is used as anchor for the MAO (fig.8) which flies as a kite, lowers the camera, and permanently 
observes the enemy location.

If prevailing wind is orthogonal to line of sight between operator and observation site. The MAO is 
deployed in an orthogonal direction (fig.9) and is configured as in (d).

f) The camera fiber may be connected to the kite assembly via a controlled roller (fig.10). It is moved 

along the main cable and changes position and altitude. The MAO and/or camera assembly may also 
have a small vertical wing to increase stability and to allow maneuver for increasing the observable 
area (fig.11).

g) The MAO may be also suspended by an air balloon (diameter 1-1,5 foot, 25-40 cm)(fig.12). In this 

case, it may operate in windless weather.  Of course the balloon would be easy to observe.

h)

i) For more efficiency or to permanently observe a large area, the MAO may be connected to three to 
eight anchors (figs. 13-14). In this case the MAO position does not depend on wind direction.

The support device or kite may have a sail form (Fig.15) or conventional airplane form (it is most 
efficient, fig.16). It must have control surfaces to control the MAO. The camera assembly itself may have 
a small vertical wing and flaps (figs.17), which allows it to move side to side and back and forth. The 
spool also allows changing the camera altitude and the flaps allow the operator to change the fiber angle.

Fig.17. Control position of TV camera.

The closed loop stabilization and pointing of the camera assembly will require a gyro wind propeller 
(figs. 18-19). The high revolution wind propeller has loads at the blade ends (fig.19). One has a rigid 
connection to the camera station, and a swivel-spring connection with the vertical wing. The gyro 
propeller has a gyroscopic effect, which does not allow a sharp turn of the video cameras.

Fig. 19. Wind gyro stabilizer.

The camera assembly may have the two video cameras (fig.20): a widely angle fixed lens and a narrow 
angle swinging mobile camera. The widely angle camera allows the operator to observe a general picture, 
the narrow angle camera allows the operator to observe a small selected object.

If the wind at low altitude is small or absent, the camera assembly may have a small electric motor which 
rotates a gyro propeller (fig.20) which move the camera. The propeller (fig.18b) can also rotate a small 
electric generator to power-up the electronics.

An auto-gyro propeller (diameter35-75 cm) (fig. 21) can be used as a support device. It may also be 

rotated by its motor or a ground driver (motor) through a cable transfer (fig.22).

The last variants are presented in figs. 23-26. In fig.23, the MAO uses an air balloon, a mobile 
controlled suspended video camera and a control suspended fiber. The air balloon (size 40-120 cm) is 
made from glass thin film, one is located at high altitude (200-500 m) and it only slightly visible from the 

13

surface. Fig.24 is the same as fig.23, but the MAO uses the propeller and motor as the support device. 
Figs. 25-26 show the control support device being used to increase the observed area.

We can also use a small mobile controlled dirigible or helicopter. Our innovation is a connection to 

them by thin fiber a small mobile controlled video camera (and microphone) and lower them to an 
observe area or an enemy location. The main apparatus flies at high altitude; the video camera suspends at 
low altitude and permanently observes a needed area.

1.3. Advantages of Micro Air Observer in comparison with Micro Air Vehicle.
1. The suggested method may be applied in wind and weather when the MAV cannot be used because 
the wind is strong, turbulence, has scuds and twirls from building and trees. Indeed, to some extent, 
the greater the wind the better the performance of the MAO.  Examining worldwide wind profiles, the 
probability of being able to use the MAO is greater than the probability of using a MAV.  For 
example, for the average annual wind speed 6 m/sec the probability of MAO launching (V minimum  

15

3 m/sec) is 0.85 when the launch is made from ground (from aircraft it is more 0.9); for MAV with 
maximum admissible speed 8 m/sec, the probability is only 0.65. 

2. The offered method allows permanently observing a large area (some sq. km) a long time (up to 

months). The current MAV can observe about 0.1 sq. km a short time (2-5 min).

3. The offered method has power located on the ground and it can transmits the video and control 

signals a long distance (up to hundreds km). The MAO or MAO can have a small electric generator, 
which is rotated by the wind propeller, and thus the devices (video camera and control) can operate a 
long time.

4. The suggested method allows permanently observing inside building rooms through the building 

windows.

5. Apparatus may be deployed quickly.
6. The MAO control is simple and does not require special training to control - unlike a micro air 

vehicle. Fitting a MAV with an autopilot is difficult and when completed still requires the MAV to 
carry along additional power to persevere.

7. Both the MAO and MAV may be deployed from aircraft or artillery shells.
8. The MAO is simpler and less expensive than a MAV.

1.4. Lack of wind.
  The MAO can only operate if the wind (at altitude) is more than some certain minimum (e.g. 2-3 m/sec).  
If the wind speed is less the minimum and MAO has special design, the MAO will land but can take off 
again when wind speed again becomes high enough to launch it.  The MAO can also have a support air 
balloon.  Special rotor kite can be supported by ground engine in windless weather.
  Of course the logical approach is use the MAO to supplement the MAV and vice versa.  The MAV and 
MAO have different conditions for application: the MAV in windless weather, MAO in wind weather. 

  1.5. Summary
   The MAO is launched from an aircraft or is launched via an artillery shell or gun into an enemy 
observation area.  As it enters a predetermined altitude 100-200 meters, the support devise is opened, the 
MAO is braked, the anchor (attached to MAO by fiber) is dropped down and connects the MAO to the 
ground (figs.1-10). The support device may be a small (less the one foot, 20-35 cm diameter) air balloon 
or small solid or inflatable kite or wing. The connection fiber also is invisible from a short distance (1-3 
meter) because it may be fashioned very thin (as a hair) and is made from transparent and strong artificial 
material. If there is a small wind (at most places the wind is 80-90% days in year at ground, see a research 
below) the MAO will be supported at altitude by a small wing or wing sail (figs.5-9, 15). In other case, 
one can be supported a special MAO having a balloon with an inflatable kite or wing (fig.12-13). The 
support device (kite or wing) may be located at high altitude (1 or more km, different from MAO) and be 
connected to MAO by a thin fiber. There is sufficient wind at these high altitude about 95-98% of the 
year. Of course a major benefit is that the batteries can be located on the ground and so the MAO can 
operate for a long time. The MAO can also have a long antenna located at a high altitude and transmit a 
video and control signal for quite some distance.  
  The operator can observe the area of interest for a very long time (even weeks).  If it is not needed in 
observation and no enemy, the soldier can reel it in up to the anchor (the anchor must have a radio-
locator) and reel the thread (fiber) and get his device back.  The MAO can be also launched as 
conventional kite for observe nearest closed area, especially, if the wind blows in enemy side.        
  The offered method and MAO has the following advantages in comparison of MAV:
1.  No needs for developing a new top technology, which can confine Research, Development, and 
Design (as Micro engine, flight control, micro aerodynamics, autopilot, and navigation system).

2.  The cost of Research and Development (R&D), design of MAO is less in 10 times that  MAV.
3.  The time of reconnaissance (observation) increases from 2-10 min to several weeks. The signals can 

be transmitted to long distance. 

16

4.  The using and control of MAO are simpler than MAV (not necessary in special training for soldiers 

or autopilot).

5.  MAO can be used in wind and bad whether. 
6.  MAO uses the video devices, radio control, and communication developed for MAV.
7.  MAO is cheaper then MAV and can be R&D and manufactured in short time.
8.  MAO may be invisible for enemy.
9.  There are a permanently air flow at high altitude

1.6. Additional possibility for support MAO  (SAO).
  High altitude wind has another important advantage. It is stable and constant.  This is true practically 
everywhere.
   Especially in the troposphere and stratosphere, the wind currents are powerful and permanent.  For 
example, at an altitude of 5 km, the average wind speed is about 20 M/s, at altitude 10-12 km it may reach 
40 m/s (at latitude of about 20-350N). 
  There are permanent jet streams at high altitude. For example, at H = 12-13 km and about 250N latitude. 
The average wind speed  at the it core is about 148 km/h. The most intensive portion, with a maximum 
speed 185 km/h latitude 220, and 151 km/h at latitude 350 in North America. On a given winter day speeds 
in the jet core may exceed 370 km/h for a distance of several hundred miles along the direction of the 
wind. Lateral wind shears in the direction normal to the jet stream may be 185 km/h per 556 km to right 
and 185 km/h per 185 km to the left.

2. Theory and computation of MAO (SAO)

2.1. Wind
(speed, duration, altitude distribution, speed distribution)

  Wind is important element of the offered method. In MAV the wind is only obstacle which 
gives trouble for operator. The wind vortexes from buildings and trees are located at near Earth 
surface. One can set down to MAV to a ground. If wind is more then 6-8 m/sec, the flight of 
MAV can be impossible. In the MAO the wind is necessary for support of the apparatus. If wind 
is less a minimum (for example, 3 m/sec) the MAO, video camera lends to ground and can be 
take-off again when the wind will stronger. If the wind is very strong, the connection cable or a 
MAO wing can be damage. 
  We can calculate the minimum and maximum admissible wind for MAO and estimate it for 
MAV. Our purpose is estimation of time (% or a number of days in year) when the MAO and 
MAV can operate.
   Annual average wind speed. On fig.2-1 is the accompanying map of the United States Annual 
Average Wing Speed taken from Wind Energy Resource Atlas of the United States. The map was 
published in 1987 by Battelle’s Pacific Northwest Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. 

17

The complete atlas can obtained by writing the American Wind Energy Association or the 
National Technical Information Service. The same maps are around the world. They are 
presented in Attachment 6. The maps show the average wind speed at altitude 10 and 50 meters. 
This speed is 5-6 m/sec.
  Wind speed and Height. Wind speed increases with height. The speed may be computed by 
equation

H
H

where V0 is the wind speed at the original height, V the speed at the new height,  H0 the original 
height, H the new height, and  the surface roughness exponent (Table 2-1).

  Annual Wind speed distribution. Annual speed distributions vary widely from one site to 
another, reflecting climatic and geographic conditions. Meteorologists have found that Weibull 
probability function best approximates the distribution of wind speeds over time at sites around 
the world where actual distributions of wind speeds are unavailable. The Rayleigh distribution is 
a special case of the Weibull function, requiring only the average speed to define the shape of the 
distribution.

 Fig.2-3 presents the annual wind distribution of average speeds 4, 5, and 6 m/s. Table #2-2 gives 
Rayleigh Wind Speed Distribution for Annual Average Wind Speed in m/s. These data gives 
possibility to easy calculate the amount (percent) days (time) when MAO or MAV can operate in 
year (fig.2-3a). It is very important value for the estimation efficiency of offered devices. 

Fig. 2-3. Wind speed distribution.

Fig. 2-3a.

  Let us compute two examples:
1) MAO. Assume, the observer has minimum admissible wind speed  3 m/s, maximum 
admissible speed 25 m/s, altitude 100 m, the average annual speed in given region is 6 m/s. From 
Table 2-2 and fig. 2-2, 2-3, 2-3a, Eq. (2-1) , we can get the wind speed is 8.4 at H=100m, the 
probability that the wind speed will be less the 2 m/s is 8%, less 3 m/sec is 15%, the probability 
that the wind speed will be more 25 m/s is closed to 0.
2) MAV. Assume, the average annual speed in given region is 6 m/s, the maximum admissible 
wind speed is 7 m/s. The probability that a wind speed will be less then 7 m/s is 55%, less then 8 
m/s is 65%.
  It means that the impossible time for MAV flights is 2-3 times more that for kite.

3. Requirement Video Camera and Control

  The capabilities of video camera are very important component for MAV, MAO and MAO. 
The video camera must be small, light as soon as possible. One must recognizes a target from 
maximum (as soon as possible) distance. It means, the TV camera must have a maximum (as 
soon as possible) pixels. It will good, if Camera has a zoom or small FOV degree.
  There are Johnson Criterion to estimate a=66+/-12 pixels across the minimum dimension of a  
target for 99.9% to 99.999% probability of ID.

25

  Some target sizes (l x w x h in meter):

- M113 Typical armored personnel carrier: 4.7 x 2.5 x 1.8 m.
- M1 Main Battle Tank: 7.9 x 3.7 x 2.4 m.
-
- Man: 0.5 x 0.5 x 1.7 m.
- Man face: 0.3 x 0.3 x0.3.

Scud surrogate George: 13.3 x 3.0 x 2.5 m.

3.1. Required Number of Pixels
 The target size s [m],  view angle  [degree], distance to target D [m], pixel number P (for one 
side, full is P x P), number of identification pixels a, are described  by equation

   Results of computation of recognition distance D via target size s for 1000 FAO pixels P, 
a=66, and = 1, 2 5, 20, 50 degrees, are presented in fig. 3-7 (not included).
  As you see, the current TV cameras request a low flying of MAV. It is bad for MAV because 
an enemy sees MAV and the enemy can put out of sight or annihilate MAV. The MAO and 
MAO also need in low location of video apparatus. However it is well, because video camera is 
separated from MAO, the camera and fibers are small and they may be difficult for enemy 
recognizing.  That way we need to separate video camera from MAO or MAO. 

(3-2)

3.3. Communication problems
   Communication problems for MAV relate primarily the bandwidth required to the small video 
size, hence small antenna size, and to the limited power available to support the bandwidth
required (2-4 megabits per second) for image transmission. Control functions demand much 
lower bandwidth capabilities, in the 10’s of kilobits range, at most. Image compression help 
reduce the bandwidth requirement, but this increases on-board processing and hence 
requirements. The limited power budget means the omni-directional signal will be quite weak. 
So directional ground antennas may be required to track the vehicle, using line-of-sight 
transmissions. But limitations to line-of-sight would be severely restrictive for urban operations, 
so architectures. 
   Most these problems absent for MAO and MAO or do not have these strong limitations. The 
MAO do not have strong limitation in size and weight because the main kite is located at high 
altitude and video apparatus do hot have wings. The lower apparatus can has a video camera 
size. No big limits in electric power, because no strong limit in weight. The fiber can has thin 
wires and the electricity can transfer from soldier to video camera. The kite is located at high 
altitude and the fiber-wires can be used as antenna. The signal distance (range) is increased in a 
lot of times. The MAO, MAO can make the surveillance permanently in jungle and small yard 
between buildings, in a given window. 

26

    If MAV has speed 20 m/sec and operator needs 3 sec to see picture, to understand image, and 
to control of MAV, it means the MAV cannot to fly in area having size less 60 m. In reality this 
size more. For example, if a MAV turn time is 3 sec, we must have additional 60 meters for 
turning (total 60 + 60 =120 m). It means the MAV cannot operate in city having a compact 
development. 

4. Examples
4.1. Example #1. (Four anchor MAO launched from aircraft). Main parameters.

   Kite: 
Wing area 0.08-0.12 m2
Minimal wind speed 3 m/sec. Minimal lift force for minimal wind speed 90-130 g.
Mass: Kite 20 – 30 g;  TV – station 20 g; fiber cable (include wire) of diameter d =0.1-0.15 mm, 
of the total length 1000 m has mass 20-32 g. Total mass: 70 – 90 g (without anchors and 
battery located at anchor). 

Admissible electric current is up 0.4 amperes for wire diameter 0.05 mm.

Probability of wind more 3 m/sec in area with average annual speed 6 m/s at altitude 10 m is 
0.85. In our case this probably is more (about 0.9) because our kite located at altitude 100-200 m.

   For  pixels 1000, D is 87 m.

 For pixels P=1000, D is 850 m.

Probability of wind more then admissible maximum speed 15 m/sec in area with average annual 
speed 6 m/s at altitude 10 m is very small (0.01). In our case this probably is more (about 0.02) 
because our balloon located at altitude 100-200 m.

Attachment #2:
The short history of MAV R&D.

  The recent history of MAVs start with a 1992 workshop on future technologies for military 
operations held by DARPA at Rand. Then-senior scientist Augenstein led a panel on micro 
vehicles, including aircraft systems ranging in size from a hummingbird down to less than 1 cm. 
Rand published a widely circulated report on the work in 1994. The Lincoln Laboratory was 
initially skeptical, but its own research also concluded that MAVs were becoming feasible.
  DARPA held a MAV feasibility workshop in November 1995, a briefing to industry in March 
1996, and a user and developer workshop in October 1996. These were mainly paper exercises 
with little real hardware. The Lincoln Laboratory conducts studies and the Naval Research 
laboratory acts as a technical agent for DARPA.
  In Fiscal 1997, DARPA started a $35-million, four-year effort to develop and demonstrate 
affordable MAVs. The agency wants aircraft with a maximum dimension of 6 in. (152 mm) to 
fly ranges up to 10 km and speeds up 40-50 mph. (70-80 km/hour) for missions that are 20 min 
to 2 hour long. MAVs are to be deployed by hand, by munitions launch or from larger aircraft. 

29

Missions include reconnaissance, targeting, placing sensors, communications relay and sensing 
dangerous substances. They are viewed as one-use, one-way missions.
  DARPA’s Tactical Technology Office awarded nine Phase 1 small business innovative research
(SBIR) contracts worth $100,000 each to either pursue system development or a specific 
technology. 
  Four of the contracts ($750,000 each)  progressed into Phase 2 in Fiscal 1998.
  After DARPA this problem are trying to solve AF and Army. Unfortunately, after 10 years 
R&D no MAV that can fly to back size of building and show what is located behind of the 
building.

Operations would be limited by winds of 30 mph. Or more, fog, heavy dust and rain. Wind 
could be particularly onerous in cities where buildings produce micro bursts that might bring 
down the UAV.

Attachment #5. Main parameters of industry produced artificial fiber
   Cable discussing.  Let us to consider the following experimental and industrial fibers, 
whiskers, and nanotubes:
1.  Industrial fibers have  = 500-620 kg/mm2,  =1560-1950 kg/m3, for K=//2.4 

=600/1800/2.4= 0.139. Young,s modules of graphite fiber is up 200 Gpa, aluminum is 63-70 
Gpa, Cupper is 127 Gpa. 

2.  Whiskers CD has  = 8000 kg/mm2,  = 3500 kg/m3 (1989)[2], p.158. We can take for 
computation  = 8000/2.4=3333 kg/mm2,  = 3500kg/m3, k = = 9.5.106, K=0.95.

3.  Experimental nanotubes CNT (Carbon nanotubes) have tensile strength 200 Giga-Pascals 
(20000 kg/mm2), Young’s modules  is over 1 Tera-Pascal, specific density =1800 kg/m3
(1.8 g/cc)(2000 year). For safety factor n =2.4,  = 8300 kg/mm2=8.3.1010 n/m2,   =1800 
kg/m3, k =/ =46.106 (K=10-7k=4.6). The theory predicts 1 Tera Pascals and Young modules 
1-5 Tera Pascals.  The nanotubes SWNT’s have density 0.8 g/cc, the nanotubes MWNT’s 
have the density 1.8 g/cc.

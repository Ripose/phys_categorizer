Abstract:  The  total  impedance  of  a  ladder-shape  network  consisting  of  inductors  and  capacitors  does  not 
converge  to  a  certain  value  when  the  steps  of  the  network  increased.  In  this  paper,  we  analyze  this  effect  in 
frequency  domain.  We  find  that  in  some  band  the  impedance  converge  to  a  limit  value  while  in  other  band  it 
doesn’t.  Based  on  this  property  in  frequency,  we  propose  a  filter  that  exhibits  excellent  performance  both  in 
amplitude and phase response. As a validation of our result, the simulation of this filter was carried out on the 
EDA software Multisim with respect to a practical circuit.   
 
1.  Introduction 

An  n  steps  ladder-shape  network  is  shown  in  Fig.1  (a).  In  order  to  calculate  the  total  resistor

nR of  the 

network, we use the equation based on the equivalent circuit shown in Fig.1(b): 

                       

                                (1)

If the ladder-shape network consists of inductors and capacitors, as shown in

Fig.2 ladder-shape network consisting   
of inductors and capacitors 

As pointed out in Ref.1, this result is not true when

1 4

LCω−

< , because Eq.4 has a nonzero real part, 

0

which means energy loss in the network that only consisting of inductors and capacitors. Therefore Eq.2 is not 

true and when the order of ladder-shape network increases, the impedance does not converge to a limit value. 

In  this  paper  we  study  this  property  of  divergence  in  frequency  domain.  In  section2  we  show  that

when

nZ do converge to a limit value. Here comes to an interesting point that it 
does exist a critical frequency cf , below and beyond this cf , the behavior of the ladder-shape network is totally 
different.  When

the  theoretical  model  with  software  Matlab  then  construct  the  practical  circuit  and  do  simulation  on  the  EDA 

software Multisim7 as a validation of our result. Finally we get our conclusion in Part 4.

).  In  order  to 

study  the  behavior  of  the  total  impedance  beyond  and  below  this  critical  frequency cf ,  we  make  the  total 
impedance of an n step ladder-shape network (represented by Zn) as a function of the frequency f , as shown in 

Fig.3.  Different  curves  in  Fig.3  represent  the  impedance  of  network  with  step  9,  10  and  11  respectively.  The 

calculation  is  based  on 

1C

nF=

  and

1L mH=

.  From  the  figure  depicted  by  Matlab,  we  obtain  the  critical 

frequency  80kHz,  which  complies  with  theoretical  value  (79.6kHz)  very  well.  For

f

f<

c

,  three  curves 

approximately  superpose  each  other.  However,  for

,  the  step  of  network  has  substantial  effect  on  the 

f

c

impedance hence three curves do not superpose each other any more. In sum, the property of total impedance of 

the  ladder-shape  network  with  capacitors  and  inductors  below  and  beyond  the  critical  frequency cf   behaves 
totally different. And this characteristic is the theoretic foundation of the filter we shall mention in the following.

Based on this theoretical analysis, we simulate the result using Multisim 7. The simulated circuit is shown 

in Fig.6. Amplitude and phase responses to frequency are shown in Fig.7. The amplitude response illustrates the 

high-pass property of the designed filter. From the trend of phase response to frequency we can see that when in 

the pass-band

, phase response shows good linearity property[6], group delay

is close to zero. 

When

f

f<

, phase response is not within our consideration because in stop-band the amplitude is attenuated 

greatly. Fig.7 shows these properties of the filter.

4.  Conclusion 

      We have proposed and demonstrated an LC ladder-shape filter based on the special behavior of total impeda- 

nce in frequency domain. Since linearity plays an important role in the property of a filter, our filter has a quite 
dϕ ω
/d

perfect linearity in the pass-band. The group delay 

  is close to zero in the pass-band which means the 

−

real-time property is quite good in our design.

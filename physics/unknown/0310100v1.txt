Regular  perturbation  solutions  are  obtained  for  the  Stokes  flow  field,  the  first  order
effects of inertia on the flow field, and the primary and secondary pressure fields in the
circular lid driven cavity.  The physical mechanism that causes vortex breakdown exists
at  small  Reynolds  number;  it  is  a  stagnation  of  the  secondary  flow  by  an  adverse
pressure gradient.  The discontinuity between the rotating lid and the stationary sidewall
has  negligible  influence  on  the  flow  field  provided  that  the  inertial  forcing  of  the
secondary  flow  is  not  localized  near  the  boundary  discontinuity,  and  the  Reynolds
number is small.

I. Introduction

The circular lid driven cavity (see Fig. 1) is a well-studied flow because it has a
Reynolds number and aspect ratio, g =L*/ro* (where L* is the length of the cavity and ro*
its radius) dependent vortex breakdown1,2.  Two geometries have been studied, one with a
stationary solid surface opposite the rotating endwall1,2, and the other with a free surface
opposite  the  rotating  endwall2.    For  Reynolds  numbers  less  than  500,  the  dominant
velocity  component  is  azimuthal.    There  is  also  a  secoondary  axial  and  radial  flow  in
which: fluid leaves the upper rotating lid, travels down the stationary sidewall, moves in
along  the  bottom  wall,  and  finally  returns  up  along  the  center  of  the  cavity.    When  the
Reynolds  number  is  greater  than  a  thousand  with  a  fixed  upper  surface,  or  greater  than
500 with a free surface, and the aspect ratio between one and two, experiments show the
eddy pattern that exists at lower Reynolds numbers is modified1,2.  Along the central axis
of  the  cavity,  the  secondary  flow  has  a  stagnation  point.    After  the  stagnation  point
follows  a  bubble  like  region  with  circulation  in  the  axial  and  radial  plane  that  is  in  the
opposite direction to circulation in the rest of the cavity.

This  work  was  stimulated  by  an  experimental  investigation  of  the  effect  of
secondary forcing on the flow field in a circular lid driven cavity by Sinha3.  In  Sinhas’

investigation,  the  rotating  endwall  undulated  over  a  less  than  5(cid:176)   angle.    The  extra
vorticity  created  by  this  undulating  endwall  changed  the  structure  of  the  bubble  in  the
center of the cavity.  At present, there are questions on the exact structure of the bubble
because there is poor agreement between experiment and simulation2.

There have been several previous investigations of the Stokes flow in a cylindrical
lid driven cavity with a fixed endwall opposite the rotating endwall.  Panton4, has found a
perturbation solution for the Stokes flow field in a short aspect ratio geometry.  Khalili
and Rath5 have also investigated exact Stokes flow solutions for the cylindrical lid driven
cavity.    Pao6  has  considered  the  time  dependent  Stokes  flow  of  a  rotating  container  of
fluid,  the  bottom  of  which  is  suddenly  brought  to  rest.    Pao6  experimentally  and
numerically verified that the Stokes solution described the  azimuthal flow for Reynolds
numbers less than ten.  Pao6 was aware that the discontinuity may affect his calculations
and  on  examining  his  numerical  results,  noted  that  nothing  peculiar  occurred  at  the
boundary discontinuity for the range of Reynolds numbers he studied.

Azerad and Bänsch11 studied the flow in a cone and plate rheometer.  This flow is
similar  to  the  circular  lid  driven  cavity  considered  here,  except  that  instead  of  a  top
rotating lid, there is a rotating cone with a tip that extends to the stationary base of the
cavity.    This  geometry  also  has  a  boundary  discontinuity  that  Azerad  and  Bänsch11
rigorously show can be neglected at low Reynolds number.  Azerad and Bänsch11 provide
an  abstract  proof  that  an  approximate  azimuthal  only  solution  describes  the  flow  field
near  the  apex  of  the  cone.    They  then  support  their  abstract  proof  with  results  from
simulations  and  experiments.    In  many  other  simulations  of  driven  cavity  flows  with
discontinuities,  the  effect  of  the  discontinuity  on  the  accuracy  of  the  simulation  is
negligible for Reynolds numbers less than one7, however a good explanation for this has
not been provided.

Spohn  et  al.2,  Brons  et  al.8, Mirghaie  et  al.9,  and Hirsa  et  al.10  have  studied  the
flow in a lid driven cavity with a free surface opposite the stationary  endwall.  In these
studies  good,  agreement  is  only  obtained  between  computations  and  experiments  for
aspect ratios greater than a half.   In particular, Mirghaie et al.9 show that at small aspect
ratio, a surfactant on the surface of the liquid can make the flow field differ from the flow
field for a surfactant free surface.

Using a regular perturbation scheme in the Reynolds number, Hills12 has studied
the first order effects of inertia in a circular semi-infinite lid driven cavity.  Hills 12 found
that because the zeroth order flow field is azimuthal, the first order inertial correction has
a  defining  role  in  the  axial  and  radial  flow  fields;  it  creates  an  infinite  sequence  of
vortices that decay with distance from the rotating endwall.

The new results in this study are that when the dominant forcing of the secondary
flow  is  not  localized  near  the  boundary  discontinuity,  the  effect  of  the  corner  singular
region at low Reynolds number can be neglected and the main features of the secondary
flow  calculated.    The  study  also  shows  that  as  suggested  by  Spohn  et  al.2,  vortex

breakdown  occurs  because  fluid  flowing  up  the  center  of  the  cavity  passes  through  an
adverse pressure gradient region where it can stagnate.

To obtain these results an analytical approach is used.  This is because even though
the  solution  is  not  valid  for  all  Reynolds  numbers,  and  even  though  it  requires
simplifying  assumptions,  when  the  assumptions  hold,  a  good  understanding  of  the
dominant  physical  mechanisms,  and  an  explanation  for  why  and  when  a  discontinuity
will  have  a  negligible  effect  on  the  flow  are  obtained.    The  results  are  then  verified  by
comparison to experiment.

Following  this  introduction,  the  governing  equations  are  obtained  and  scaled  in
section II.  The flow field is solved for in Section III.  The perturbation scheme used is
described in section 3 part A, and exact Stokes solutions obtained in part B with a free
and fixed surfaces opposite the rotating endwall.  The equations governing the secondary
flow are described in part C, where the effect of the discontinuity on the forcing function
for the secondary flow is examined.  Asymptotic solutions at small aspect ratio and small
Reynolds  number  are  obtained  for  the  first  order  flow  and  pressure  fields  with  a  fixed
endwall in parts D and E.  Finally, in section IV, the results of this study are discussed in
light of previous experimental and numerical work.

II. Governing Equations

The flow of an incompressible fluid in a cylindrical lid driven cavity is modeled
by  the  steady  state  Navier-Stokes  equations  with  no  slip  boundary  conditions  which,
assuming cylindrical symmetry, are in dimensionless form,

Although this renders the scaling near the singular region between the rotating and
stationary  walls  invalid,  for  ease  of  computation  the  velocity  transition  between  the
stationary sidewall and the rotating top wall is modeled as a sudden jump

An asymptotic expansion in the Reynolds number, as used by Hills12, is used to
calculate the flow.  The field variables are expanded in series in powers of the Reynolds
number,

To  calculate  the  pressure  field,  pressure  boundary  conditions  are  required.
Without  a  full  solution  to  the  nonlinear  equations  of  motion,  the  appropriate  boundary
conditions cannot be calculated.  To overcome this difficulty, which is created by using a
perturbation solution, an approximation is made that all the boundaries are at atmospheric
pressure.    With  a  free  surface,  the  pressure  at  the  free  surface  is  atmospheric.
Furthermore,  in  an  experiment  there  is  a  small  gap  between  the  rotating  endwall  and
stationary sidewall.  Since in steady state there is no flow through this gap, the dynamic
pressure at this gap (which excludes hydrostatic effects) must be equal to the atmospheric
pressure.    At  low  Reynolds  number,  the  dynamic  pressure  at  the  walls  will  not  be  too
different from atmospheric pressure in an apparatus with a free surface.  Since for aspect
ratios  close  to  one,  and  Reynolds  numbers  below  500,  the  secondary  flows  in
experiments  with  fixed  and  free  surfaces  are  the  same2,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume
atmospheric  pressure  boundary  conditions  as  an  approximation  to  the  actual  pressure
boundary  conditions  in  an  experiment  for  both  boundary  conditions  at  low  Reynolds
number.

With a stationary  endwall, this flow field also has null boundary conditions.  With a free
surface, the flow field also has null boundary conditions except at the free surface where
the axial partial derivative of the azimuthal and radial velocities is zero.  At first order,
the  azimuthal  velocity  field  is  again  uncoupled  from  the  axial  and  radial  fields.    In
comparison  to  the  zeroth  order  flow,  the  first  order  azimuthal  velocity  field  has  no
forcing  term,  and  is  zero.    The  first  order  pressure  field  has  null  boundary  conditions
because the approximate boundary conditions are met at zeroth order;/

The Stokes flow field has  azimuthal symmetry and so only depends on the radial

where  I1  is  the  modified  Bessel  function  of  first  order.    Eq.  (7)  is  plotted  for  three
different aspect ratios in Figs. 2a, 2b, and 2c.  The figures show that for tall aspect ratios,
the  azimuthal flow is concentrated in a region near the rotating wall, whereas for short
aspect ratios the azimuthal flow has a uniform axial velocity gradient.

The series expressions for the steady state Stokes flow field are complicated, and to
analytically compute the first inertial correction, a simpler expression is required.  Fig. 2d
shows the first part, rz, of the solution for an apparatus with one stationary endwall in Eq.
(7).  By comparing Figs. 2a and 2b to Fig. 2d, one observes that as found by Panton 4, the
expression  rz  is  a  good  approximate  representation  of  the  Stokes  flow  field  for  small
aspect ratios in an apparatus with a stationary endwall.

The  simplified  expression  for  the  steady  state  flow  field  at  small  aspect  ratio,  rz,
can also be obtained analytically.  In Eq. (7) one can use the asymptotic expansions of the
2p x   see  Bender  and

This solution is plotted for aspect ratios of 0.1,1, and 10 in Figs 3a, 3b and 3c.

With a free surface, an asymptotic analysis similar to that with a fixed end  wall,
shows  that  at  small  aspect  ratio,  the  dominant  solution  is  solid  body  rotation.    This
solution  is  a  good  approximation  to  the  flow  field  at  small  aspect  ratio  and  Reynolds
number, everywhere except near the stationary sidewalls.

C. Governing equations for the first order inertial corrections

The analysis in this section shows that the discontinuity between the rotating and
stationary  walls  creates  at  worst  a  delta  function  forcing.    Although  a  solution  for  this
forcing  can  be  found,  it  cannot  satisfy  the  scaling  requirements,  which  require  that  the
first order flow field is smaller than the  zeroth order flow field throughout the domain.
Consequently, singular perturbation theory is required to resolve the flow at the junction
between the rotating and stationary walls.  Since it is difficult to analytically compute the
flow at the junction between the rotating and stationary walls, the purpose of this section
is  to  determine  the  conditions  for  which  the  effect  of  the  discontinuity  on  the  forcing
functions can be neglected.

This  forcing  function  does  not  converge  in  the  classical  sense.    The  convergence
properties  are  worst  at  the  discontinuity  between  the  rotating  and  stationary  walls.    By
examining  the  properties  of  the  forcing  function  at  the  discontinuity,  one  can  check
whether  a  reasonable  solution  to  the  first  order  flow  can  be  obtained.    At  the  rotating
outer wall, the most singular part of the forcing function becomes the product of a  Dirac
delta  function  and  a  Heaviside  function.    Products  of  distributions  with  support  at  the
same point are ill defined; however the magnitude of the Heaviside function is bounded,
and so the strength of the forcing is at worst a delta function forcing,

To obtain a physically reasonable solution for the first order flow, the conditions
at  the  corner  cannot  be  modeled  using  a  jump  discontinuity.    Firstly,  because  the
modeling  assumption  that  the  first  order  flow  has  a  smaller  magnitude  than  the  zeroth
order  flow  is  violated.    Secondly,  because  in  any  physical  situation,  there  will  be  an
imposed length scale appropriate to the corner, this could be:  a balance between viscous
and inertial forces, a balance between surface tension and viscous forces, the gap between
the  rotating  and  stationary  walls,  or  a  Knudsen  length  scale  because  the  continuum
assumption no longer holds.  It is therefore appropriate to modify the forcing function to
reflect a minimum resolvable scale.

An  approximate  forcing  function  can  be  obtained  by  truncating  the  series
representation.  This imposes a minimum length scale.  Simple truncation does not ensure
a  convergent  series.    In  a  trigonometric  expansion,  a  procedure  that  results  in  a
convergent truncated series is the application of Lanczos correction factors to the original
trigonometric  expansion15.    These  factors  replace  the  discontinuous  jump  in  velocity,
with  a  smooth  rapid  transition  region  that  still  preserves  the  properties  of  the  solution
away from the discontinuity.  The factors also preserve the integral value of the forcing.

The index k denotes the largest resolvable wave number.  The forcing function is now a
convergent sum over a finite number of terms.  Forcing functions for aspect ratios of 0.1,
1, and 10 are shown in Figs. 4a, 4b, and 4c.  From these figures one observes that at the
transition  between  the  rotating  and  stationary  walls,  the  forcing  function  has  a  large

approaches a delta function.

Fig.  4d  shows  the  approximate  forcing  function  for  a  flow  with  a  stationary
endwall,  2r2z,  with  the  most  singular  part  removed.    It  is  quantitatively  similar  to  the
forcing function at an aspect ratio of 0.1 (Fig. 4a) and qualitatively similar to the forcing
function  at  an  aspect  ratio  of  one  (Fig.  4c).    The  approximate  forcing  function  differs
from  the  exact  forcing  functions  at  the  boundary  discontinuity,  where  the  exact  forcing
functions have a large magnitude spike.

With a free surface, the series expansion for the forcing function also does not
converge because of the discontinuity between the rotating endwall and the stationary
sidewall.  Using Lanczos correction factors, the forcing function is,

This forcing function is plotted in Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c for aspect ratios of 0.1, 1 and 10.
At small aspect ratio, Fig. 5a shows that the forcing function is close to zero everywhere
apart from near the stationary sidewall.  This behavior is very different from the forcing
function shown in Fig. 4a for an apparatus with a stationary endwall opposite the rotating
endwall; in which the forcing is not localized near the junction between the rotating and
stationary walls.  Figs. 5b and 5c however, are similar to Figs. 4b and 4d for which the
free surface is replaced by a no slip boundary condition.

D. The first order flow field at small aspect ratio with a fixed endwall

The  first  order  flow  field  is  computed  using  the  approximate  small  aspect  ratio
Stokes  solution  for  an  apparatus  with  a  stationary endwall,  rz,  as  the  forcing  function.
The first order flow field is not computed for a small aspect ratio apparatus with a free
surface  because  in  this  geometry  the  flow  near  the  boundary  discontinuity  must  be
computed  to  calculate  the  internal  axial  and  radial  motions.    The  partial  differential
p ).    The
equation  for  the  particular  solution  of  the  streamfunction  is,
appropriate boundary conditions are discussed in part C, however these are modified to
obtain an analytically tractable solution; a free slip boundary condition is enforced on the

top  and  bottom  walls  for  the  radial  motions.   
condition does not hold in an experiment, but because the driving force for this flow does
not  occur  at  the  walls,  the  solution  obtained  gives  the  qualitative  features  of  the
secondary flow pattern.

The  constants  G1n  and  G2n,  are  chosen  to  ensure  that  the  streamfunction  and  its  first
radial partial derivative are equal to zero on the outer stationary wall.

Sample streamfunctions are shown in Figs. 6a and 6b for aspect ratios of 0.1 and 1.
The centrifugal forces created by the rotating top wall push fluid out away from it.  The
fluid then travels down in a narrow layer along the stationary outer wall before returning
to the top rotating layer through the center of the cavity.

The calculated streamline patterns in Figs. 6a and 6b are similar to those observed
in  experiments  for  Reynolds  numbers  below  a  thousand1.    Experiments  show  that  for
aspect  ratios  less  than  one,  and  for  Reynolds  numbers  less  than  a  thousand,  vortex
breakdown  does  not  occur1,2.    These  experiments  also  show  that  the  same  flow  pattern
exists  for  Reynolds  numbers  less  than  one  and  up  to  a  thousand  before  vortex
breakdown1,2.  This justifies the approximations made in obtaining the analytical solution.

E. The first order pressure field at small aspect ratio with a fixed endwall

The  first  order  pressure  field  is  governed  by  an  equation  obtained  by  taking  the

divergence of the first order equations of motion.  This gives,

As described in section III part A, null boundary conditions are imposed on all walls for
this  forced,  second  order,  linear  partial  differential  equation.    Like  the  forcing  function
for the flow field, the series representation of the forcing function for the pressure field
also does not converge because of the discontinuous boundary conditions.  As was shown
in  section  III  part  B,  rz  is  an  asymptotic  representation  of  the  velocity  field  in  a  small
aspect  ratio  apparatus  with  a  stationary  endwall.    When  this  is  used  in  the  forcing
function, the effect of the boundary discontinuity is neglected and a tractable analytical
solutions is possible.  The resulting partial differential equation for the pressure field is,

IV. Discussion
A. Comparison with Semi-infinite Cavity

Hills12  showed  that  for  a  semi-infinite  cylindrical  lid  driven  cavity,  the  primary
azimuthal flow field decayed exponentially with distance from the rotating endwall.  This
is in agreement with the results from this study where in a large aspect ratio apparatus,
the primary azimuthal flow is concentrated near the rotating endwall.

Also in agreement with this study, Hills12 found that the centrifugal forces created
by  the  rotating  endwall  drive  the  axial  and  radial  fluid  motions.    For  the  semi-infinite
cavity however, Hills12 found a sequence of eddies that decayed with distance from the
endwall.    This  study  shows  that  in  a  small  aspect  ratio  apparatus  with  a  stationary
endwall, there is only one eddy in the secondary flow.  Comparing these results to studies
of the rectangular lid driven cavity7, suggests that as the aspect ratio of the cylindrical lid
driven cavity is increased, the number of eddies will also increase.

This study shows that as found by Hills12, because the primary flow field has only
an  azimuthal  component,  the  first  order  correction  to  the  primary  flow  field  has  a
determining  influence  on  the  axial  and  radial  velocity  fields.    Similarly,  because  the
gradient  of  the  primary  dynamic  pressure  field  is  zero,  the  first  order  correction  to  the
pressure field has a determining influence on the pressure gradient.

B. Why vortex breakdown occurs

The  flow  map  obtained  by  Escudier 1  shows  that  with  one  fixed endwall,  vortex
breakdown only occurs for aspect ratios greater than one.  This calculation shows that the
vortex  is  created  by  centrifugal  forcing  due  to  the  rotating  endwall.    This  calculation
supports  Spohn  et  al.’s 2  suggestion  that  the  vortex  breaks  down  because  of  the  adverse
pressure gradient faced by the secondary fluid flow in the center of the cavity.  This is
because an adverse pressure gradient exists even at very small Reynolds numbers and the
flow pattern at small Reynolds numbers is similar to that at Reynolds numbers just below
those for vortex breakdown.

(cid:229)
At  very  small  aspect  ratio,  Figs.  7a  and  7b  show  that  even  though  there  is  an
adverse pressure gradient, the adverse pressure gradient is very small, and so will not be
large  enough  to  cause  vortex  breakdown  in  an  apparatus  with  a  stationary  endwall
opposite  the  rotating  endwall.    The  streamlines  in  Figs.  6a  and  6b  also  show  that  the
secondary  flow  along  the  central  axis  of  the  cavity  gets  weaker  with  increasing  aspect
ratio because the streamlines are wider.  This is because with increasing aspect ratio, the
dissipative flow is driven the same amount by the rotating endwall, but needs to travel a
longer distance to circulate round the cavity.

Vortex  breakdown  has  also  been  observed  in  lid  driven  cavities  with  a  free
surface for aspect ratios greater than a half2.  The forcing functions for axial and radial
flow for lid driven cavities with aspect ratios greater than one in and with free slip or no
slip  boundaries  opposite  the  rotating  endwall  are  similar;  this  suggests  that  the  vortex
breakdown mechanism is the same for the two geometries.  For very small aspect ratios
however, the forcing functions are different, suggesting that the secondary flow in a small
aspect ratio apparatus with a free surface - even if it is clean - will be very different from
the simple circulation pattern calculated here for an apparatus with a fixed endwall.

C. Boundary Discontinuity

The  boundary  conditions  examined  in  this  study  have  a  discontinuity  at  the
junction  between  the  rotating  and  stationary  walls  where  it  is  difficult  to  compute  the
flow field.  In many numerical studies of lid driven cavities, the computed flow field is
also insensitive to the modeling of the discontinuity7.  The results of this study show that
this insensitivity is because the distributed forcing by the moving lid, dominates over the
forcing by the corner discontinuity.  In such a situation, the effect of the discontinuity on
the secondary flow can be neglected entirely.

In  contrast,  when  the  forcing  is  localized  near  the  discontinuity,  such  as  in  the
small  aspect  ratio  apparatus  with  a  free  slip  surface,  the  discontinuity  can  be  important
and  this  may  explain  why  simulations  fail  to  reproduce  experimental  results8.
Furthermore,  because  the  forcing  by  the  discontinuity  is  highly  localized,  any  other
disturbances can have a large impact on the flow field.  In particular, because in a small
aspect ratio apparatus with a free surface a significant portion of the fluid is in solid body
rotation  and  has  weak  axial  and  radial  currents,  surface  stresses  due  to  surfactants  can
have  an  important  influence  on  the  flow  field.    This  may  explain  why  when  inertial
effects are important, the flow field with a surfactant is very different from the flow field
without a surfactant as observed by Mirghaie et al.9.

Once  the  eddy  structure  observed  at  low  Reynolds  number  ceases  to  exist,
Sinhas’3 experimental study shows that the creation of extra vorticity at the discontinuity
between  the  rotating  and  stationary  endwalls  changes  the  flow  pattern  in  the  bubble.
When the bubble is formed, fluid that has flowed past the discontinuity stagnates in the
middle of the cavity.  The vorticity created by the discontinuity changes the flow field in
the bubble because it affects the vorticity distribution at the stagnation point.  Since there

12

is  no  axial  motion  at  the  stagnation  point,  the  vorticity  at  the  stagnation  point  has  an
important influence on the flow field in the bubble.

Spohn  et  al.2  compared  their  experimental  observations  of  the  flow  field  in  a
cavity  with  a  fixed  endwall  to  numerical  simulations.    They  observed  that  after  vortex
breakdown,  simulations  produced  radially  symmetric  bubbles  whereas  experiments
produced  radially  asymmetric  bubbles.    This  might  be  due  to  the  effect  of  local
asymmetries at the discontinuity between the rotating endwall and stationary sidewall.

Finally, if one attempts to obtain a regular perturbation solution in the Reynolds
number  for  a  circular  Couette  flow  in  a  finite  apparatus  with  stationary  endwalls:  the
Stokes  flow  solution  can  be  found  using  a  finite  Fourier  transform16,17;  the  dominant
component of the forcing function for the first inertial correction however, is at the corner
discontinuity.  In such a situation one cannot neglect the discontinuity.  Experiments and
simulations  of  circular  Couette  flows  with  a  rotating  inner  cylinder,  a  stationary  outer
cylinder,  and  stationary  endwalls,  have  anomalous  modes  where  the  secondary  flow  is
axially asymmetric, even though the domain is axially symmetric18.  When experiments
are done with a  rotating inner cylinder, stationary outer cylinder, and rotating endwalls,
anomalous  modes  are  not  observed18.    This  is  because  with  a  rotating  endwall,  the
centrifugal  forces  dominate  in  driving  the  secondary  flow,  whereas  with  a  stationary
endwall,  the  flow  field  near  the  discontinuity  drives  the  secondary  flow.    In  such  a
situation,  local  asymmetries  at  the  discontinuity  may  give  rise  to  these  anomalous
symmetry breaking modes.

V. Conclusion

The analytical solution found in this study shows that for Reynolds numbers less
than  one,  when  the  axial  and  radial  motions  are  primarily  driven  by  distributed
centrifugal forces created by the rotating  endwall, the flow in a lid driven cavity can be
computed without a detailed description of the conditions at the boundary discontinuity.
When inertial effects are important, the conditions at the discontinuity may have a strong
effect  on  the  flow  field  and  need  to  be  carefully  modeled  for  simulations  to  replicate
experimental  observations.    The  results  also  support  Spohn  et  al.’s2  suggestion  that,
vortex  breakdown  in  this  geometry  is  due  to  stagnation  of  the  secondary  flow  by  an
adverse pressure gradient.

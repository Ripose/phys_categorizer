Abstract: 

 A  numerical  model  was  developed  for  flows  involving  an  interface  between  a 

homogenous  fluid  and  a  porous  medium.  The  numerical  model  is  based  on  the  finite 

volume  method  with  body-fitted  and  multi-block  grids.  The  Darcy-Forchheimer  extended 

model  is  used  to  govern  the  flow  in  the  porous  medium  region.  At  its  interface,  a  shear 

stress  jump  was  imposed,  together  with  a  continuity  of  normal  stress.  Furthermore,  the 

effect  of  the  jump  condition  on  the  diffusive  flux  is  considered,  additional  to  that  on  the 

convective  part  which  has  been  usually  considered.  Numerical  results  of  three  flow 

configurations  are  presented.  The  modeling  is  suitable  for  problems  which  have  complex 

interface boundary conditions coupling between two flow domains.

INTRODUCTION 

The study of flow systems which compose of a porous medium and a homogenous fluid 

has  attracted  much  attention  since  they  occur  in  a  wide  range  of  the  industrial  and 

environmental  applications.  Examples  of  practical  applications  are:  flow  past  porous 

scaffolds  in  bioreactors,  drying  process,  electronic  cooling,  ceramic  processing,  overland 

flow  during  rainfall,  and  ground-water  pollution.  Two  different  approaches,  the  single-

domain approach [1, 2] and the two-domain approach [3, 4], are usually used to solve this 

type of problems. 

In  the  single-domain  approach,  the  composite  region  is  considered  as  a  continuum  and 

one  set  of  general  governing  equations  is  applied  for  the  whole  domain.  The  explicit 

formulation  of  boundary  conditions  is  avoided  at  the  interface  and  the  transitions  of  the 

properties  between  the  fluid  and  porous  medium  are  achieved  by  certain  artifacts  [5]. 

Although this method is relatively easier to implement, the flow behavior at the interface 

may not be simulated properly, depending on how the code is structured [6].  

In the two-domain approach, two sets of governing equations are applied to describe the 

flow in the two regions and additional boundary conditions are applied at the interface to 

close  the  two  set  of  equations.  This  method  is  more  reliable  since  it  tries  to  simulate  the 

flow behavior at the interface. Hence, in the present study, the two-domain approach, and 

the implementation of the interface boundary conditions, will be considered. 

One of the several early studies on the interface boundary conditions is that by Beavers 

and Joseph [7]. In their approach, the fluids in a homogenous fluid and a porous medium 

are governed by the Navier-Stokes and Darcy equations respectively. A semi-empirical slip 

 

3

boundary-condition was proposed at the interface; because the flows in the different regions 

are  governed  by  the  corresponding  partial  differential  equations  of  different  orders.  To 

make  the  governing  equations  of  the  same  order,  Neale  and  Nader  [8]  introduced  a 

Brinkman  term  in  the  Darcy  equation  for  the  porous  medium;  and  thus,  proposed 

continuous boundary conditions in both stress and velocity. By matching both velocity and 

shear stress, Vafai and Kim [9] provided an exact solution for the fluid flow at the interface, 

which  includes  the  inertia  and  boundary  effects.  However,  a  stress  jump  condition  does 

occur at the interface as deduced by Ochoa-Tapia and Whitaker [10, 11] based on the non-

local form of the volume averaged method.  

Numerical  solutions  for  the  coupled  viscous  and  porous  flows  have  been  attempted  by 

many researchers [2, 3, 4, 12]. Different numerical methods such as finite volume method 

and  finite  element  method  have  been  used.  Jue  [2]  simulated  vortex  shedding  behind  a 

porous square cylinder by finite element method. In his study, a general non-Darcy porous 

media  model  was  applied  to  describe  the  flows  both  inside  and  outside  the  cylinder.  A 

harmonic means was used to treat the sudden change between the fluid and porous medium. 

Costa et al. [4] proposed a control-volume finite element method to simulate the problems 

of  coupled  viscous  and  porous  flows.  A  continuity  of  both  velocity  and  stress  at  the 

interface  was  assumed  and  no  special  or  additional  procedure  was  needed  to  impose  the 

interfacial boundary conditions.  

However,  different  types  of  interfacial  conditions  between  a  porous  medium  and  a 

homogenous  fluid  have  been  proposed;  and  found  to  have  a  pronounced  effect  on  the 

velocity field as shown by Alazmi and Vafai [13]. Although the one-domain approach, or a 

 

4

continuity of both velocity and stress, is easier to implement, the more realistic stress jump 

condition has been adopted by many researchers. 

The implementation of the numerical methodology on the stress jump condition can be 

found in the work of Silva and de Lemos [3]. Although they proposed that their treatment 

could be used in a complex geometry, their results were based on finite volume method in 

an orthogonal Cartesian coordinate system and for the case of fully developed flow. In their 

study,  only  the  jump  in  shear  stress  was  included  and  no  special  treatment  on  velocity 

derivatives was mentioned. However, for flow in general, it is needed to consider how to 

formulate the velocity derivatives at the interface. Also, for the two-dimensional problem, 

the normal stress condition is needed to close the sets of equations.   

The  objective  of  the  present  study  was  to  develop  a  numerical  model  based  on  finite 

volume method to treat the stress jump condition given by Ochoa-Tapia and Whitaker [10, 

11]. As the interface naturally divides the whole domain into different parts and its location 

is  known  a  priori,  the  multi-block  method  is  used.  By  combining  body-fitted  and  multi-

block  grids,  the  method  is  effective  for  complex  boundary  conditions  at  the  interface 

between different domains. The numerical model is more rigorous as it considers the effect 

of the stress jump condition on both convective and diffusive fluxes.  

MATHEMATICAL MODEL 

Considering steady, laminar flow of an incompressible, viscous fluid, the governing 

equations for a homogenous fluid region, using vector form, can be written as:

    The porous medium is considered to be rigid, homogeneous and isotropic; and saturated 

with  the  same  single-phase  fluid  as  that  in  the  homogenous  fluid  region.  Considering 

viscous  and  inertia  effects,  the  governing  equations  for  porous  region  based  on  Darcy-

Forchheimer extended model can be expressed as [14, 15]:

At  the  interface  between  the  homogeneous  fluid  and  the  porous  medium,  additional

velocity component normal to the interface. By combining with the appropriate boundary 

conditions of the composite region, Equations (1) - (7) can be used to simulate the flow in 

system composed of a porous medium and a homogenous fluid. 

NUMERICAL MODEL 

The  finite  volume  method  based  on  nonorthogonal  grid  is  used  to  discretize  the 

governing  equations  [16].  Cartesian  velocity  components  are  selected  as  dependent 

variables  in  the  momentum  equations;  and  the  solution  algorithm  is  based  on  SIMPLEC 

method.  The  non-staggered  grid  arrangement  is  applied  and  the  Rhie  and  Chow 

interpolation [17] is used to obtain a suitable coupling between pressure and velocity. 

In some cases, the location of the interface between a porous medium and a homogenous 

fluid is known a priori. This interface naturally divides the composite region into different 

 

 

 

7

parts. Also, in some cases, structured grids are difficult, even impossible, to construct for 

complex geometries. Therefore, in present study, block-structured grids method is applied. 

There are in general three types of interfaces when the block-structured grids method is 

employed  to  calculate  the  flow  in  the  composite  region:  fluid  -  fluid  interface,  porous 

medium - porous medium interface, and homogenous fluid - porous medium interface. 

A typical control volume is shown in Figure 1. For a general dependent variable ϕ,  a 

final discrete form over the control volume can be written as:

and  S the  source  term.  The  detailed  numerical  methodology  for  obtaining  the  convective

To obtain the deferred derivatives at the cell face, the derivatives are calculated first at the 

control volume centers and then interpolated to the cell faces. By using the Gauss’ theorem,

The  different  methods  to  approximate  the  value  of ϕ and  its  derivative  at  the  cell  face 

result  in  different  interpolation  schemes.  In  present  study,  a  second  order  scheme,  the 

central difference scheme (CDS) is used.  

For the interfaces treatment, the fluid – fluid interface and the porous medium – porous 

medium  interface  are  easier  to  be  implemented  because  there  are  no  sudden  changes  of 

 

9

properties  near  the  interface  region.  In  this  case,  the  two  types  of  block  interfaces  are 

treated as the interior cell faces rather than boundaries, which was proposed by Lilek et al. 

[19]. The grids in two neighboring blocks match at the interface in present study.  

The  present  model  also  considers  the  interface  between  a  porous  medium  and  a 

homogeneous  fluid  as  the  interior  cell  face.  However,  the  calculation  of  convective  and 

diffusive fluxes at the interface has to be reformulated because the stress jump condition is 

used  and  the  linear  interpolation  (CDS)  fails  to  approximate  the  fluxes  there.  The 

formulation  of  the  convective  and  diffusive  fluxes  at  the  interface  is  developed  from 

Equations (5) to (7). 

Figure  2  shows  details  of  the  interface  between  a  porous  medium  and  a  homogeneous 

fluid. Two neighbor control volumes, lying in the homogenous fluid and the porous region 

respectively, share the interface. The velocity vector at the interface is given by

To obtain higher order approximation of the derivatives, the velocity components at more 

auxiliary  nodes  may  be  needed.  Alternatively,  the  shape  functions  may  be  used,  which 

 

11

produces  a  kind  of  combined  Finite  Element/Finite  Volume  method  for  calculating  the 

higher order approximations.  

By  making  use  of  Equations  (19)  to  (23),  the  Cartesian  velocity  components 

u

 and 

u  at the interface are obtained. Then the convective fluxes at the interface can 

be  calculated.  The  diffusive  fluxes  are  calculated  from  Equations  (21)  -  (23).  By 

substituting  the  fluxes  in  Equation  (8),  and  solving  the  resultant  algebraic  equations,  the 

flow field can be obtained in all domains.  

 

 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

The  numerical  results  of  three  flow  situations  will  be  presented:  flow  in  a  channel 

partially filled with a layer of a porous medium, flow through a channel with a porous plug, 

and flow around a square porous cylinder. All the results presented are grid-independent.  

1.  Flow in a channel partially filled with a layer of a porous medium 

The physical domain is shown schematically in Figure 3. It consists of a planar channel 

which is horizontally divided into a homogenous fluid region with height 

1H  above and a 

fluid-saturated porous region with height 

2H   below. The case of height ratio 2

Following  the  proposal  of  Nield  et  al.  [20],  Equations  (26)  to  (29)  can  be  solved 

analytically  as  shown  in  the  Appendix.  Both  numerical  and  analytical  solutions  are 

presented for validation of the present numerical implementation.  

Figure 4 shows the u velocity profile under different flow conditions. It is seen that the 

numerical and analytical results are in good agreement. The effect of the Darcy number (Da) 

on the u velocity profile is presented in Figure 4a in which the Da varies from 10-3 to 10-1 

 

13

while  the  other  parameters  are  kept  constant.  Although  in  practical  applications,  Da  may 

not  go  up  to  10-2  [21],  nevertheless  this  range  is  also  presented  to  show  Da  effect  more 

clearly.  From  Figure  4a,  it  is  seen  that  the  u  velocity  decreases  with  the  increase  of  Da. 

When Da is less than 10-3, the u velocity in the porous medium is almost zero except the 

region near the interface.  The effect of the porosity (ε) on the u profile is shown in Figure 

4b.  The  u  velocity  should  decrease  as  the  porosity  decreases  and  the  numerical  and 

analytical results seem to show the trend. However, in the porous medium region around -

0.33 < Y < -0.62, the u velocity is slightly larger when the porosity is smaller. This may be 

because the β chosen here is kept constant even though it should vary with the variation 

ofε. The Forchheimer number (F) does not have much effect on the velocity distribution. 

The velocity decreases slightly when F increases from 1 to 100 as shown in Figure 4c. The 

effect of the jump parameter (β) on the flow is shown in Figure 4d, which indicates that 

the u velocity increases noticeably asβ increases.  

2.  Flow through a channel with a porous plug 

The physical domain of the second problem is shown schematically in Figure 5, which is 

the same as that by Gartling et al. [12] and Costa et al. [4]. In this problem the flow passes 

through  a  planar  channel  with  a  porous  plug  under  an  imposed  overall  pressure  gradient. 

Different  from  the  first  problem,  the  governing  dimensionless  parameters  are:  Reynolds 

number based on the mean velocity,

are chosen as Re = 1, 

Da

−

, 

ε=

0.7

, 

FC = and 
1

0.7β=

. 

The numerical results are shown in Figure 6, where the centerline u velocity and pressure 

along x direction are presented. It is seen that the velocity drops rapidly in the porous plug, 

across which there is a large pressure drop. The flow field is predominantly axial over most 

of  the  homogenous  fluid  and  porous  medium  regions,  but  it  is  two-dimensional  in  the 

region near the interface between the homogenous fluid and the porous medium. The trends 

of the present results are in general agreement with those of Gartling et al. [12] and Costa et 

al.  [4].  However,  there  are  slight  differences  in  the  velocity  magnitude  in  the  porous 

medium are because the stress jump conditions are applied in the present study whereas the 

continuous stress conditions are applied previously.   

 

3.  Flow around a square porous cylinder 

The above two problems concern internal flow problems with regions of a homogenous 

fluid and a porous medium. To illustrate an external flow problem with complex geometry, 

the  flow  around  a  square  porous  cylinder  is  considered.  The  computational  domain  and 

mesh  are  shown  schematically  in  Figure  7  and  Figure  8  respectively.  The  governing 

dimensionless  parameters  are  the  same  as  those  of  the  porous  plug  problem  above: 

Reynolds number based on the mean velocity and the height of the cylinder,

parameterβ. In this study, Re is chosen as Re = 20 to ensure the steady and laminar flow. 

 

15

Three different Da = 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4 are chosen and other parameters are kept constant 

namely, 

ε=

0.4

, 

FC = and 
1

0.7β=

. 

The  flow  streamline  for  the  flow  around  a  square  porous  cylinder  at  different  Da  are 

presented in Figure 9. At smaller Da (=10-4 in Figure 9a), that is the cylinder permeability 

is  small,  very  little  fluid  flows  through  the  cylinder.  Hence  the  flow  field  resembles  that 

around a solid cylinder. When Da increases to 10-3 (Figure 9b), the vortex in the wake is 

reduced as there is more bleed fluid. At higher Da (=10-2 in Figure 9c), the large bleed flow 

has prevented vortex formation. 

 

 

CONCLUDING REMARKS 

A  general  numerical  model  was  developed  for  problems  with  interface  between  a 

homogenous  fluid  and  a  porous  medium.  The  numerical  model  is  based  on  finite  volume 

method with body-fitted and multi-block grids, which is effective for dealing with complex 

boundary  conditions  at  the  interface  between  different  domains.  The  shear  stress  jump 

condition  is  applied  at  the  interface,  and  affects  both  the  convective  and  diffusive  fluxes. 

The normal stress condition, assumed continuous at the interface, is also needed in order to 

close  the  two  sets  of  equations.  The  general  model  was  applied  to  solve  three  flow 

configurations.  

The numerical model of flow over a porous layer extends the work of Silva and Lemos 

[3] by using multi-block grid and including the diffusive flux term. The results compares 

well  with  the  analytical  solution.  The  numerical  results  for  flow  through  a  porous  plug 

 

16

exhibit slight difference in velocity in the porous medium, as compared with the studies of 

Costa  et  al.  [4]  and  Gartling  et  al.  [12]  which  assume  continuity  of  shear  and  normal 

stresses  at  the  interface.  The  numerical  model  of  flow  past  a  porous  cylinder  includes 

coupling of two domains (fluid and porous medium); it continues on the study of Jue [2] 

which, however, was based on a one-domain approach.

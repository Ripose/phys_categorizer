We propose a way to make arrays of optical frequency dipole-force microtraps for 

cold atoms above a dielectric substrate. Traps are nodes in the evanescent wave fields 

above an optical waveguide resulting from interference of different waveguide modes. 

The traps have features sought in developing neutral atom based architectures for 

quantum computing:  (cid:1) 1 mW of laser power yields very tight traps 150 nm above a 

waveguide with trap vibrational frequencies  (cid:1) 1 MHz and vibrational ground state sizes 

(cid:1) 10 nm. The arrays are scalable and allow addressing of individual sites for quantum 

logic operations. 

 

  

 

 

Requirements for the physical implementation of quantum computing are a quantum two-

level system (qubit) for storing quantum information, the ability to initialize and read out 

the qubits, a set of universal quantum gates (one- and two-qubit gates), long decoherence 

times, and scalability.(1) Recent cold neutral atom based quantum computing schemes 

(2,3) share several features. The qubit consists of two hyperfine states of an individual 

atom, tightly confined in a “microtrap.” One-qubit operations may be effected using 

either microwave fields or optically, using stimulated Raman transitions. Reading out or 

projecting the state of a qubit would be accomplished using laser-induced fluorescence. 

The most challenging requirement for quantum computing is performing the two-qubit 

operations needed for a universal quantum computer. Two qubits must be selected and 

controllably made to interact and entangle. Schemes using the “dipolar” interaction (4) or 

“controlled collisions” (5) for entanglement have been investigated. To perform quantum 

computations of interest with error correction  (cid:1) 104 qubits are required. Therefore, 

microtrap based schemes containing one atomic qubit per trap need to be scaled up to 

these numbers. One possible way of doing this is using optical lattices. So far as we 

know, all proposed large-scale implementations of quantum computing using 3D optical 

lattices have difficulties addressing individual atoms, either to select specific atoms for 

one or two qubit gate operations or for reading out. We have found a way of creating 1D 

and 2D optical lattices on a chip and discuss how these may solve the qubit addressing 

difficulty and allow scaling up qubit registers. 

 

 

The prospect of a wide variety of applications has helped spawn recent research efforts 

towards miniaturization of atom optics components on condensed matter substrates --- 

atom chips. Two major approaches to controlling atoms on atom chips are magnetic or 

opto-magnetic atom manipulation (6) and evanescent wave (EW) based techniques that 

exploit the “dipole-force.” (7,8).  

Optical dipole-force traps for atoms (9) are usually made by creating either a local 

maximum (for laser light red-detuned from an atomic resonance, 

0w ) or minimum (for 

blue-detuned light) of light intensity at an isolated point in space. By interfering laser 

beams in free space, one can create an optical lattice, a 3D array of sub-wavelength sized 

microtraps located at the nodes or antinodes of the interference pattern. The spacing 

between traps is l/2, where l is the wavelength of the trapping lasers. Traps near 

condensed matter surfaces may be made using the evanescent optical frequency electric 

fields created by total internal reflection of light traveling within the condensed matter 

substrate, but an outstanding problem is to arrange to have the desired intensity extrema 

isolated in space and not at the vacuum-surface interface. Previously, this problem has 

been circumvented either by using two colors of laser light --- a red detuned EW that 

attracts atoms toward a surface and a second blue detuned wave keeping them from 

actually hitting the surface --- or by using additional forces for trapping such as gravity or 

the atom-surface van der Waals force (7).  

Relevant previous theoretical work includes the proposal of Barnett et al. to use two-color 

EWs above a slab-type optical waveguide to create a cold atom waveguide.(8) Burke et 

al. have proposed several waveguide based EW traps and their “dark-spot” trap is the 

closest the previous literature comes to the present work.(7) 

 

 

 

 

The present experimental state-of-the-art in EW traps is the two color trap of Hammes et 

al. (10)  in which about 20000 Cs atoms were confined to a  (cid:1)  0.3 mm diameter pancake 

shaped region about 1 micrometer above a prism. Dumke et al.(11) have realized an array 

of microtraps by trapping  85 Rb atoms at the foci of a laser beam passed through a 

substrate patterned with an array of micro-lenses. Those traps were spaced 125mm apart 

and confined up to 1000 atoms each, 625mm above the substrate surface.  

 

 

The essential new idea of our work is illustrated in Fig. 1(a). A planar waveguide consists 

of a guiding dielectric film with index of refraction  Wn  over a dielectric substrate with 

index 

Sn , where 

n <

. We consider TE modes of light of wavelength l (frequency w) 

propagating along  z , which have only an x-component Ex of electric field and for which 

analytic solutions exist.(12) A traveling wave in the mth mode propagates with a spatial 

phase of  exp[

decreases with increasing mode order up to “cutoff” --- the highest order guided mode.

determined by the laser power in the respective modes. Along the waveguide there are 

values of z, occurring periodically with spatial period

and by adjusting the ratio of laser powers in the modes, we can create field nodes (nodal 

lines along x), at any desired height, 

*y , above the waveguide (see Fig. 1(b)).  

Now, a 2D optical lattice can be constructed by crossing two of these 1D waveguide 

structures, identical apart from their propagation directions, as shown in Fig. 1(c). Here, 

the waveguide confines light only in the y -direction. In the transverse direction along the 

waveguide, the input laser beams are collimated. In the area of overlap, a 2D array of 

nodal points is created, which, for laser light blue-detuned from resonance, can trap 

atoms. For the cases we consider, the potential energy of an atom in an optical frequency 

field is: (7)

We modeled such a 2D EW optical lattice for trapping  85 Rb atoms. In a quantum 

computer an  85 Rb  atom could store a qubit using the

transition,l= 780 nm. We used TE0 and TE1 modes of a planar waveguide that 

consisted of a 260 nm thick

. The 

resulting 2D square array of nodes has a nearest neighbor spacing of 0.98mm. To make 

strong traps with currently available materials, it is necessary to work very close to the 

waveguide surface. We designed traps to be located 150 nm above the waveguide 

surface. We arbitrarily picked laser powers so that the mode(s) requiring the most power, 

the TE0 mode(s), had 1 mW permm of the width of the laser beam in the transverse 

direction. A power of 0.204 mW permm of laser beam width in the TE1 mode(s) then 

resulted in nodes 150 nm above the surface. The laser tuning determines the depth of the 

microtraps and the spontaneous emission rate. A detuning of 1000  G to the blue of 

resonance produces traps that are 3.0 mK deep. The microtraps are extremely tight: The 

vibrational frequencies for atoms oscillating in the trap are

The lattice as described is much closer to the surface than any previously demonstrated 

trap. Similar traps, 500 nm above the surface, would be only  (cid:1)  2 mK deep.  At 150 nm,

But for quantum information applications, an important question is whether the proximity 

of the dielectric surface will lead to decoherence. So far as we know, no one has yet 

observed or suggested any specific decoherence mechanisms --- the problem simply has 

not been studied. (13,14) 

 

 

 

Initial loading of atoms into such an array of traps could be accomplished via a 

superfluid-Mott insulator transition analogous to the 3D optical lattice loading recently 

demonstrated by Bloch et al.(15)  This transition automatically produces the desired one 

atom per site into the microtrap vibrational ground states. 2D Mott transitions are 

expected for boson species. Alternatively, 2D arrays could be loaded more 

conventionally:  by “puddling” atoms in an evanescent wave above the waveguide and 

then simultaneously turning on the trapping fields and deep-cooling the atoms.(10)  

For a dipole trap at a field node, in the two-level approximation, the rate of spontaneous 

emission events for an atom in the vibrational ground state, h, is related to the 

eigenfrequencies of the trap by

For the array described above, this is 13 kHz.  Spontaneous emission does not lead to the 

loss of trapped particles --- in contrast to magnetic trapping. It does, however, limit the 

coherence time of the qubit, which in turn limits the number of operations possible before 

decoherence occurs. This number should exceed  (cid:1) 104 to enable quantum computation 

with error correction. Increasing the detuning decreases the spontaneous emission rate, 

but weakens the trap. In our example, increasing the detuning by a factor of 300 leads to 

10 mK deep traps. Only the ground state in the weakened harmonic oscillator potential is 

bound and the spontaneous emission rate is reduced to 2.5 Hz. One can do better still by 

increasing the laser power and further increasing the laser detuning. Increasing the laser 

power by a factor of 10 is reasonable, increasing it by a factor of 1000 may be possible. 

 

A translatable 1D lattice of atom traps, a shift register of qubits, may be constructed by 

destructively interfering modes of a channel or ridge waveguide. We found, numerically, 

(16) the 20 lowest order modes for a 0.45 mm thick by 1.0 mm wide

guide on a NaF substrate, shown in Fig. 2. Modes are no longer pure TE or pure TM but 

we found that there were several pairs of modes that could interfere to make a periodic 

array of optical frequency field EW nodes, 3D atom traps, as depicted in Fig. 2. 

Confinement in the y and z-directions is achieved as in the previous case by picking two 

modes with different waveguide propagation vectors, 

ak  and 

bk , and, in turn, with 

different EW decay lengths in the vacuum region. For the modes we chose, the 

yE  

component is largest and provides trapping in those dimensions. In addition, the chosen 

modes had components 

( )
xE r  and 

( )

zE r  that were anti-symmetric about  x =0, the 

center of the width dimension of the waveguide, and provided confinement in the x-

direction. We chose the pair of modes that made the strongest traps. These had ka=1.304 

· 107 m-1 and kb=1.105 · 107 m-1 and resulted in a linear array of nodes spaced 3.2 

mm apart. This array can hold a register of qubits. As above, we picked the power of the 

stronger mode, a, to be 1 mW, and created nodes 150 nm above the waveguide surface 

with a power of 0.081 mW in mode b. A tuning of the laser field 1000  G  to the blue of 

resonance produces microtraps with a depth of 1.15 mK.  85 Rb atoms would be confined 

with  vibrational frequencies fx=2.17 MHz, fy=2.34 MHz, and fz=0.8 MHz, and ground 

state dimensions bx=7.3 nm, by=7.0 nm, and bz=12.0 nm. The spontaneous emission rate 

for an atom in the vibrational ground state of a microtrap is 1.3 kHz. As above, increasing 

the laser detuning trades trap strength for reduced spontaneous emission. The register of 

qubits may be shifted along the waveguide by adjusting the phases of the two modes. 

One can imagine various quantum computing architectures using these 1D and/or 2D 

lattices. The surface geometry allows selectively driving one-qubit operations by 

stimulated Raman transitions and reading out individual qubit states using laser-induced 

fluorescence. The required laser beams may be introduced from above. So, reading the 

state of a qubit might be carried out with an apparatus similar to the read head of a CD 

player.  For 1D lattices, the laser beams could also be introduced through additional 

waveguides, for example orthogonal to the microtrap array. One example of a two qubit 

gate using 1D registers works as follows. Two parallel 1D registers can be made within a 

few mm of one another. Two designated qubits--- one in each register --- can be lined up 

adjacent to one another by adjusting the phases of the waveguide modes. By feeding the 

qubits an appropriate sequence of laser pulses the selected qubits can be excited into 

Rydberg states and entangled via electric dipole-dipole interaction. 

 

 

We have described a way to create 2D and 1D periodic arrays of optical microtraps above 

optical waveguides. These are analogs of 3D optical lattices. For quantum computer 

applications, beneficial aspects of these microtrap arrays include: they require little 

power; the traps are extremely tight; all ground state hyperfine Zeeman states are 

confined; trapping at field nodes reduces spontaneous emission decoherence problems; 

the system is highly scalable, and, most importantly, individual qubits are readily 

addressable. The most problematic feature of these traps is that, to get strong trapping 

with waveguides made from existing materials and using low laser powers, it is necessary 

to work very close to the surface of the waveguide. At this time, the impact the surface 

will have on the coherence required for quantum information applications is an entirely 

open issue.  

 

 

While we have focused on possible quantum information applications of the proposed 

optical lattices on chips, we conclude by noting other possible uses. The near-surface 

feature of the traps could be exploited to study atom-surface interactions. For example, 

atom-surface forces perturb the vibrational frequency of a trapped atom for the normal 

mode that is perpendicular to the surface and by accurately measuring this frequency as a 

function of distance above the surface, it should be possible to study those forces. We 

estimate that stable traps may be generated at distances from 10 nm to 500 nm above the 

waveguide surface. In this range, the character of the atom-surface force should change 

from a “van der Waals” force to “Casimir” force.  More generally, regular optical lattices 

have long been used as model systems for diverse problems and recently have proved 

especially useful for studying fundamental solid state questions. We anticipate the trap 

arrays described above could be used in similar studies as model 1D and 2D periodic 

systems. (17)

During the last years there has been a lot of interest in generalized classical theories.
The most typical examples are theories involving Grassmann variables [1], [2] (this last
paper was largely inspired by the work in [5]). The corresponding path-integral quantiza-
tion requires the notion of integration over the phase-space variables. This procedure is
very well known for the particular case mentioned above [3]. The problem of deﬁning the
path-integral in the general case is too much complicated and we have limited ourselves
to the ﬁrst necessary step, that is to deﬁne an integration procedure over an arbitrary
algebra. This approach is described more completely in paper [4], to which we refer for
all the details. Here we will outline only the most important steps. We want to deﬁne the
integral as a linear mapping between the given algebra and the real numbers, but we need
to specify further the properties of such a mapping. We do this by requiring the physical
principle of the combination law for the probability amplitudes.
In ordinary quantum
mechanics this is mathematically expressed through the completeness of the eigenstates
of the position operator. In order to extend this idea to the general case we use the same
approach followed in the study of non-commutative geometry [6] and of quantum groups
[7]. The approach starts from the observation that in the normal case one can reconstruct
a space from the algebra of its functions . Giving this fact, one lifts all the necessary
properties in the function space. In this way one is able to deal with cases in which no
concrete realization of the space itself exists.

In order to see how we can lift up the completeness from the base space to the space
of functions, let us suppose that this admits an orthonormal set of functions. Then, any

function on the base space can be expanded in terms of the complete set {ψn(x)}. It turns
out convenient to deﬁne a generalized Fick space, F ,and the following special vector in it

n anψn(x) can be represented as f (x) = ha|ψi where ha| =
Then, a function f (x) =
(a0, a1, · · · , an, · · ·). To write the orthogonality relation in terms of this new formalism
it is convenient to realize the complex conjugation as a linear operation on F . In fact,

the orthogonality relation becomes

|ψihψ|C dx = 1

Another important observation is that the orthonormal functions deﬁne an algebra. In
fact we can expand the product of two eigenfunctions in terms of the eigenfunctions

with

The relation (3) makes reference only to the elements of the algebra of functions
that we have organized in the space F , and it is the key element in order to deﬁne the
integration rules on the algebra. In fact, we can now use the algebra product to reduce the
ψp(x) dx,
expression (3) to a linear form. If the resulting expression has a solution for
then we are able to deﬁne the integration over all the algebra of functions, by linearity.
Notice that a solution always exists, if the constant function is in the set {ψn(x)}.

The procedure we have outlined here is the one that we will generalize to arbitrary
algebras. Before doing that we will consider the possibility of a further generalization. In
the usual path-integral formalism sometimes one makes use of the coherent states instead
of the position operator eigenstates.
In this case the basis in which one considers the
wave functions is a basis of eigenfunctions of a non-hermitian operator ψ(z) = hψ|zi with
a|zi = |ziz. The wave functions of this type close an algebra, as hz∗|ψi do. But this

time the two types of eigenfunctions are not connected by any linear operation. In fact,
the completeness relation is deﬁned on an algebra which is the direct product of the two
algebras

dz∗dz
2πi

Z

exp(−z∗z)|zihz∗| = 1

Therefore, in similar situations, we will not deﬁne the integration over the original algebra,
but rather on the algebra obtained by the tensor product of the algebra times a copy. The
copy corresponds to the complex conjugated functions of the previous example.

Let us start with a generic algebra A with n+1 elements xi, with i = 0, 1, · · · n. We do
this for simplicity, but there are no problems in letting n → ∞, or in taking a continuous
index. We assume the multiplication rules

xixj = fijkxk

with the usual convention of sum over the repeated indices. The structure constants
fijk deﬁne uniquely the algebraic structure. Consider for instance the case of an abelian
algebra. In this case

xixj = xjxi −→ fijk = fjik

Or, for an associative algebra, from xi(xjxk) = (xixj)xk, one gets

filmfjkl = fijlflkm

We introduce now the space F , and the special vector

|xi =

|xi ∈ F

In order to be able to generalize properly the discussion made for the functions, it will
be of fundamental importance to look for linear operators having the vector |xi as eigen-
vector and the algebra elements xi as eigenvalues. This notion is strictly related to the
mathematical concept of right and left multiplication algebras associated to a given
algebra [4]. The linear operators we are looking for are deﬁned by the relation

that is

Xi|xi = |xixi

(Xi)jkxk = xjxi = fjikxk

In a complete analogous way we can consider a bra h˜x|, deﬁned as the transposed of the
ket |xi and we deﬁne left multiplication through the equation

The two matrices Xi and Πi corresponding to right and left multiplication are generally
diﬀerent. For instance, consider the abelian case. It follows from eq. (8)

If the algebra is associative, then from eq. (9) the following three relations can be shown
to be equivalent:

XiXj = fijkXk, ΠiΠj = fijkΠk,

[Xi, ΠT

j ] = 0

The ﬁrst two say that Xi and Πi are linear representations of the algebra. The third that
the right and left multiplication commute for associative algebras.

Recalling the discussion made for the functions we would like ﬁrst consider the case of
a basis originating from hermitian operators. Notice that the generators xi play here the
role of generalized dynamical variables. It is then natural to look for the case in which
the operators Xi admit both eigenkets and eigenbras. This will be the case if

that is if Πi and Xi are connected by a non-singular C matrix. This matrix is exactly the
analogue of the matrix C deﬁned in the case of functions. From eq. (14), we get

or

implying

By putting

we have

(Xi)jk = fjik

h˜x|Πi = xih˜x|

(Πi)kj = fijk

Xi = ΠT

h˜x|CXiC −1 = xih˜x|

|xihx| = 1

In this case, the equations (11) and (21) show that Xi is the analogue of an hermitian
operator. We will deﬁne now the integration over the algebra by requiring that

where 1 is the identity matrix on the (n + 1) × (n + 1) dimensional linear space of the
linear mappings on the algebra. In more explicit terms we get

(x) xi, we can say to have deﬁned the integration
If we can invert this relation in terms of
R
over the algebra, because we can extend the operation by linearity. In particular, if A is
an algebra with identity, let us say x0 = 1, then, by using (23), we get

xixj =

Z(x)

Z(x)

fijkxk = (C −1)ij

xi = (C −1)0i = (C −1)i0

Z(x)

and it is always possible to deﬁne the integral.

We will discuss now the transformation properties of the integration measure with
respect to an automorphism of the algebra. In particular, we will restrict our analysis to
the case of a simple algebra (that is an algebra having as ideals only the algebra itself and
the null element). Let us consider an invertible linear transformation on the basis of the
algebra leaving invariant the multiplication rules (that is an automorphism) x′
i = Sijxj
with x′
k. For a simple algebra, one can show that [4]

j = fijkx′

ix′

where k is a constant. It follows that the measure transforms as

Let us consider now the case in which the automorphism S can be exponentiated in the
form S = exp(αD). Then D is a derivation of the algebra. If it happens that for this
particular automorphism S, one has k = 1, the integration measure is invariant, and the
integral satisﬁes

for any function f (x) on the algebra. On the contrary, a derivation always deﬁnes an
automorphism of the algebra by exponentiation. So, if the corresponding k is equal to
one, the equation (27) is always valid.

Of course it may happen that the C matrix does not exist. This would correspond
to the case of non-hermitian operators as discussed before. So we look for a copy A∗ of
the algebra. By calling x∗ the elements of A∗, the corresponding generators will satisfy
i x∗

Then, we deﬁne the integration rules on the tensor product of A and A∗ in such a way
that the completeness relation holds

|xih˜x∗| = 1

Z(x,x∗)

(29)

This second type of integration is invariant under orthogonal transformation or unitary
transformations, according to the way in which the ∗ operation acts on the transformation
matrix S. If ∗ acts on complex numbers as the ordinary conjugation, then we have invari-
ance under unitary transformations, otherwise if ∗ leaves complex numbers invariant, then
the invariance is under orthogonal transformations. Notice that the invariance property
does not depend on S being an automorphism of the original algebra or not.

The two cases considered here are not mutually exclusive. In fact, there are situations
that can be analyzed from both points of view [4]. We want also to emphasize that this
approach does not pretend to be complete and that we are not going to give any theorem
about the classiﬁcation of the algebras with respect to the integration. What we are
giving is rather a set of rules that one can try to apply in order to deﬁne an integration
over an algebra. As argued before, there are algebras that do not admit the integration
as we have deﬁned in (23). Consider, for instance, a simple Lie algebra. In this case we
have the relation fijk = fjki which implies Xi = Πi or C = 1. Then the eq. (23) requires

δij =

xixj =

fijkxk

Z(x)

Z(x)

(30)

which cannot be satisﬁed due to the antisymmetry of the structure constants. Therefore,
we can say that, according to our integration rules, there are algebras with a complete set
of states and algebras which are not complete. On the contrary there are many examples in
which our rules allow the deﬁnition of an integration. We recall here, bosonic and fermionic
integration, the q-oscillator and the paraGrassmann cases, and ﬁnally the integration over
the algebras of quaternions and octonions (all these examples are discussed in [4]).

The work presented here is only a ﬁrst approach to the problem of quantizing a
theory deﬁned on a conﬁguration space made up of non-commuting variables, the simplest
example being the case of supersymmetry. In order to build up the functional integral, a
second step would be necessary. In fact, one needs a diﬀerent copy of the given algebra to
each diﬀerent time along the path-integration. This should be done by taking convenient
tensor products of copies of the algebra. Given this limitation, we think, however, that
the step realized in this work is a necessary one in order to solve the problem of quantizing
the general theories discussed here.

Abstract

A  CW  high  power  linear  accelerator  can  only  work
with  very  low  particles  losses  and  structure  activation.
At  low  energy,  the  RFQ  is  a  very  sensitive  element  to
losses. To design the RFQ, a good understanding of the
beam  dynamics  is  requested.  Generally,  the  reference
code PARMTEQM  is  enough  to  design  the  accelerator.
TOUTATIS  has  been  written  with  goals  of  cross-
checking results and obtaining a more reliable dynamics.
This paper relates the different numerical methods used
in  the  code.  It  is  time-based,  using  multigrids  methods
and  adaptive  mesh  for  a  fine  description  of  the  forces
without  being  time  consuming.  The  field  is  accurately
calculated  through  a  Poisson  solver  and  the  vanes  are
fully  described,  allowing  to  properly  simulate 
the
coupling  gaps  and  RFQs  extremities.  Differences  with
PARMTEQM and LIDOS.RFQ are shown.

1  TOUTATIS ALGORITHM

The scheme used by TOUTATIS to simulate the beam
dynamics in RFQ is simple. The charge distribution, ρ, is
discretized in a 3D mesh with a “cloud in cell” scheme.
In  the  same  grid,  the  vane  geometry  is  embedded  and
likened to a Dirichlet boundary. The Poisson equation is
solved  with  the  obtained  grid.  The  solver  is  detailed  in
the following sections. Finally, forces are extracted from
the  potential.  This  scheme  allows  to  take  into  account
external  fields,  space  charge  and  image  effects.  Forces
are  applied  to  macro-particles  via  the  following  step  to
step scheme:

electrical field; r, βc, γ, q,  m,  respectively  the  position,
speed, relativistic factor, charge and mass of the particle.
The main advantage of this scheme is that its Jacobian is
strictly  equal  to  one.  Then,  the  code  is  preserved  from
phoney  damping  of  emittance  which  may  occur  with
“leap frog” scheme [1]. This algorithm can be looped to
reach any longitudinal position in the RFQ.

2  FINITE DIFFERENCE METHOD

In  TOUTATIS,  the  Poisson  equation  is  solved  using
the  Finite  Difference  Method.  The  purpose  of  this
section  is  not  to  describe  in  detail  this  well  known
method.  The  reader  will  find 
literature  many
specialized  books  [2,3].  Only  the  main  principles  are
presented.

in 

In  the  mesh  (Fig.1),  a  particular  node,  labelled  0,  is
bind to its neighbours,  labelled  from  1  to  6,  by  a  finite
equation.  This  equation  is  a  function  of  the  electrical
potential  on  each  node,  Ψ
i,  the  charge  density  on  the
considered node, ρ

 This kind of weighting allows to take into account the
vane  shape  very  accurately.  The  famous  “stairs”
discretization  is  then  avoided.  The  principle  is  to
compute  each  node  of  the  grid  with  its  associated
equation  taking  into  account  the  new  values  calculated
for  the  previous  nodes.  Once  all  nodes  of  the  mesh
computed, 
reach
convergence,  in  other  words,  until  the  values  of  the
electrical  potential  don’t  change  anymore.  This
particular way to use finite difference equation is called
Gauss-Seidel relaxation. The accuracy of this method is
only  a  function  of  h.  When  h  tends  towards  zero,  the
solution becomes exact [2]. However, the convergence is
slow enough to become prohibitive for the simulation of
a  whole  RFQ  with  reasonable  values  of  h  and  δt.  For
instance,  one  week  of  computation  on  a  Pentium  450
MHz  is  necessary  for  the  IPHI  design  [4].  Several
methods have been developed to get acceleration of the

looped 

to 

relaxation  process.  We  can  quote 
the  Chebyshev
acceleration [5] and the Frankel-Young acceleration [2].
The  next  section  describes 
the  method  used  by
TOUTATIS  to  reduce  this  computation  time  from  one
week to 5 hours.

 3  MULTIGRID METHODS

ρ=∆Ψ
 

 Practical multigrid methods were first introduced in the
1970s  by  Brandt  [6].  Basically,  we  need  to  solve  the
following equation:

(Eq. 3)
 with  ρ,  the  source  term;  Ψ,  the  researched  scalar
potential; ∆, the Laplacian operator. The source term  is
discretized  in  a  fine  grid.  Performing  i  Gauss-Seidel
cycles  on  this  fine  grid,  we  obtain  a  rough  estimation,
Ψi,  of  Ψ.  The  Laplacian  of  Ψi  is  not  equal  to  ρ,   the
difference:

 

 4  ADAPTIVE MESH REFINEMENT

 In  order  to  take  into  account  neighbour  bunches,  the
longitudinal  dimension  of  the  grid  is  set  to  βλ  and  a
longitudinal  periodicity  is  imposed  in  the  relaxation
process.  The  main  drawback  of  this  technique  occurs
during  acceleration  of  the  bunch.  As  the  phase  spread
decreases, the resolution on the bunch decreases also.

 To  simply  solve  this  problem,  TOUTATIS  uses  a
second mesh  which  is  embedded  in  the  main  grid  (Fig.
4). Its dimensions are function of bunch rms sizes while
the  big  grid  dimensions  are  function  of  the  vane
geometry.

(Eq. 4)

 is  called  the  residual  or  defect.  This  residual  is  the
solution  of  a  second  Poisson  equation  dealing  with  the
error:

(Eq. 5)

(Eq. 6)
 This is an important point in multigrid methods, we are
going to estimate the error after a few relaxations rather
than  the  final  solution  Ψ  step  by  step.  In  order  to  get
rapid  estimation  of  this  error,  the  equation  (Eq.  5)  is
solved  performing  a  relaxation  process  using  a  coarser
grid,  the  residual  having  been  previously  discretized  in
this  new  mesh  (restriction).  This  coarser  grid  is  also
marred  by  mistakes  which  can  be  estimated  employing
the same technique, and so on…To correct one fine grid
with  the  coarser  one  result,  an  interpolation  process,
named  prolongation,  is  performed.  This  is  the  main
principle  of  the  multigrid  methods.  The  user  has  to
combine  the  different  stages  in  respect  of  his  problem.
This gives many possibilities of cycle architectures. We
can  quote  the  V  cycle  which  is  very  common  [7].  The
cycle used by TOUTATIS is described in the figure 2.

 5  TESTS

5.1  Theoretical comparison

 The  multigrid  solver  has  been  validated  with  a
gaussian  cylindrical  beam.  Figure  3  shows  the  radial
component  of 
the  electrical  field  calculated  with
different resolutions for the finest grid (653, 333, 173, 93)
compared to the theoretical value.

different resolutions of the finest grid (653, 333, 173, 93).
 

 This test shows the good agreement achieved with this
solver. The maximum discrepancy is less than 0.7 % for
the 653 and 333 cases. It is also interesting to notice that
the  low  resolution  cases  give  a  reasonable  agreement
which allows very fast calculations (15 minutes).

3  Gauss-Seidel  relaxations,  R  =  Restriction,  P  =
Prolongation).

5.2  Experimental comparison

between  TOUTATIS 

 The reference [1] describes  in  details  an  experimental
confrontation 
and  RFQ2
measurements  performed  in  1993  at  CERN  [8].  It  is
shown  that  the  discrepancy  is  in  the  same  region  of
measurements  errors,  around  5  %,  while  PARMULT
discrepancy is around 15 %.

 6  SIMULATION OF COUPLING GAPS
 The  main  advantage  of  the  numerical  approach  of
TOUTATIS  is  the  possibility  to  simulate  any  vanes
geometry. For example, the effect of discontinuity as the
coupling  gaps  for  segmented  RFQs  can  be  estimated.
This  is  a  very  important  point,  especially  when  the
geometry of these gaps (Fig. 5) is slightly complicated in
order to reduce the sparking probability [4,9].

 This study shows that:
•  The  coupling  gaps  must  be  included  in  beam
dynamics  simulations  to  avoid  too  optimistic
forecasts (emittances, losses, activation).

•  The  gap  width  has  to  be  set  as  small  as  possible

and the center located at Young’s positions.

 7  CONCLUSION

 A  new  RFQ  code  for  beam  simulation,  TOUTATIS,
has been written with goals of cross-checking the results
of other codes  and  reaching  a  more  reliable  description
of  the  electrical  fields  in  the  linac.  Its  numerical
approach  allows  to  simulate  accurately,  for  any  vanes
geometry, 
to
PARMTEQM which is limited by cylindrical harmonics
[12,13].  The  multigrid  solver  permits  fast  calculations
compared to LIDOS which uses Chebyshev acceleration
[5].  An  adaptive  mesh  refinement  is  implemented  in
order  to  describe  as  well  as  possible  the  charges
distribution without impairing the computation time.

TOUTATIS has been also written to be a friendly user
code  (multiplatforms,  PARMTEQM  input  file  can  be
directly used as TOUTATIS input file).

 To  minimize  the  coupling  gap  perturbation,  Lloyd
Young,  from  LANL,  has  put  into  practice  a  new
technique  consisting 
the
longitudinal position crossed by the synchronous particle
when the RF power is equal to zero [10]. Applying this
concept in a particular cell, this gives the law:

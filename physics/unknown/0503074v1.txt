We present empirical evidence that the range of random time series associated with the 

tangled nature model of evolution exhibits a devil’s staircase like behavior characterized 

by logarithmic trend and the “universal” multi-affine spectrum of scaling exponents 

qζ  

of 

q ≤

Cq

 moments of q-order height-height correlations, whereas for 

q >

Cq

 the 

moments behaves logarithmically.

Many complex systems evolve through periods of relative quiescence separated by brief 

outbursts of hectic activity.1 The intermittent activity has been observed in a great variety 

of  systems  studied  in  physics,2  biology,3  geosciences,4  and  econophysics.5  While  the 

punctuated equilibrium behavior frequently associated with avalanche dynamics outlined 

for  Self-Organized  Critical  systems  [16],  recently  it  was  pointed  out7  that  the  similar 

behavior also is also characteristic of Tangled Nature model of evolution.8 Accordingly, 

to  model  a  system  displaying  punctuated  dynamics,  first  of  all  we  need  to  distinguish 

between two fundamentally different scenarios of system evolution.

The  Self-Organized  Criticality  (SOC)  focus  on  the  spatio-temporal  dynamics  of 

avalanches  which build  up  long-range  correlations  in  the  system,9  whereas  the  Tangled 

Nature (TN) model10 stresses the increase stability of sequential metastable states, leading 

to a slowing down of the pace of evolution [7,8]. Time series analysis with methods from 

statistical  physics  allows  us  to  develop  and  verify  macroscopic  models  of  complex 

systems evolution on the basis of data analysis.11 Specifically, the analysis of the scaling 

properties of  the time  series  fluctuations has been  shown  to  give  important information 

regarding  the  underlying  processes  responsible  for  the  observed  macroscopic  behavior 

[10].  Accordingly,  time  series  of  appropriate  observables,

)(tp

,  can  be  analyzed  to 

distinguish between different scenarios leading to punctuated equilibrium behavior.  

The  essential  feature  of  TN  model  is  the  logarithmic  slow-down  of  the  evolution  [7]  in 

contrast  to  scale-invariant  dynamics  associated  with  SOC  [1,6,9].  In  [7]  the  time  record 

tM =
)(

max

tp
)(

  is  used  to  illustrate  the  difference  between  SOC  and  TN  evolution.  It 

was  found  that  the  correlations  between  the  consecutive  quakes  (changes  of 

)(tM )  are 

negligible  and  the  consecutive  quake  waiting  times  are  statistically  independent.  In  this 

Letter,  we  show 

that 

the  scaling  analysis  of

,  permits  to  distinguish  between  SOC  and  TN  scenarios  of 

system  evolution  and  gives  additional  information  about  the  correlations  in  system 

dynamics.

The  fluctuations  of  any  time  series  can  be  characterized  by  the  magnitude  (absolute 

value)  of  changes  and  their  direction  (sign).12  The  magnitude  series  relates  to  the 

nonlinear properties of the original time series, while the sign series relates to the linear 

properties  [11].  It  was  found  that  the  magnitude  of  fluctuations  of  many  apparently 

random  time  series  exhibits  fat-tailed  power-law  distribution  and  display  long  range 

power law correlations, characterized by the so-called Hurst exponent ζ  [10,11]. The sign 

time series also exhibit the scale-invariant dynamics but with different scaling exponent 

signζ   [11].    Moreover,  the  scaling  properties  of  negative  and  positive  changes  of  real-

world time series may be different.13 14  This asymmetry should be reflected in the scaling 

behavior of time series range 

)(tR .  

 

 

 

In  this  work,  we  analyzed  the  historical  price  records  (in  constant  US  dollars)  of  some 

commodities15 (crude oil, natural gas, gold).  Early, the fluctuations in these time series 

were  studied  in  Refs.161718  It  was  found  that  the  magnitude  of  price  changes, 

),( τtP∆

 

exhibit  long-range  power-law  correlations,  nevertheless  the  price

changes

 are uncorrelated beyond rather short time scales [14,16]. 

The  distributions  of  negative  and  positive  changes  are  fat-tailed  and  characterized  by 

slightly  different  exponents  [14].  We  note  that  these  properties  are  consistent  with  the 

SOC, as well as with the TN scenarios of market evolution.19  

Accordingly, in this work we focus on the scaling behavior of 

)(tR  and its relation to the 

scaling behavior of the sign and magnitude of price changes. To test the correlations in 

the 

analyzed 

time 

series  we 

studied

 from the West Texas Intermediate crude oil price listings [15]. To 

avoid the effect of inflation we analyse the crude price in constant 2003 US dollars over 

the  period  from  2  January  1986  to  28  May  2004  representing  4652  observations 

(weekends  and  business  holidays  are  excluded).    We  find  (see  Fig.  2  a)  that  the 

autocorrelation function of price record decays exponentially as 

∝C

exp(

 with a 

characteristic time

find  that

  (see  Fig.  2  (c-d)).    So,  there  are  no  long-range

correlations in the crude oil price record. This is consistent with the finding that the crude 

oil spot price distribution is a symmetric logistic distribution (see insert in Fig. 1 (a)).  

At the same time, we note that the absolute values negative changes, 

−∆P , generally are 

larger then positive changes,

 (see Fig. 1 (b)), while the number (frequency) of 

∆ +P

positive changers

 are slightly larger then the number of negative changes

We  find  that  the  difference

result  of  these  “leverage  effects”,  the  price  range 

)(tR   displays  stepwise  increase  with 

logarithmic trend (Fig. 1 (d)) expected in TN model of market evolution.22  

Furthermore, we find that rang increments (Fig. 3 (a)) are distributed according to the fat-

tailed log-logistic distribution (Fig. 3 (b)) with Lévy index

 out of Lévy stable 

range  (

)(tR  has the devil’s staircase 

like behavior (Fig. 1 (d)), characterized by the “universal” spectrum of scaling exponents

from  power-law  (1)  to  logarithmic  behavior  (3)  of  the  q-order  height  difference 

correlation function is consistent with the logarithmic trend of 

)(tR .  

It should be emphasized that the same results also were obtained for all price records of 

length  3650  observations  between  different  dates  within  the  original  limits  (from  2 

January  1986  to  28  May  2004).    Further,  we  find  that  the  ranges  of  all  studied  price 

commodities  display  the  devil’s  staircase  like  behavior  with  logarithmic  trend, 

characterized by spectrum of scaling exponents (1) with

,  for  fat-tiled  distributions  of 

range increments of all studied price commodity records is found to be out of Lévy stable 

range. Detailed results of these studies will be published elsewhere.

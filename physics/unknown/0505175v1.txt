The Eddington-Weinberg Relation and the Cosmic Coincidence Problem

The  Eddington-Weinberg  relation  is  shown  to  be  an  alternative  statement  of  the  cosmic
coincidence problem.  This eliminates the need for Dirac’s suggestion that the constant of gravitation varies
in time.

Eddington  first  identified  the  perplexing  occurrences  of  large  pure  numbers  of
order 1040 that may be obtained from the parameters of the Universe [1].  Some of those
relationships among large numbers can be expressed in the elegant form

3 ,
2H0 ~ GcmN
(1)
where    
h  is  the  reduced  Planck’s  constant,  H 0  is  the  current  value  of  the  Hubble
parameter, G is the constant of gravitation and mN is the mass of the nucleon [2].  Eq. (1)
is known as the Eddington-Weinberg relation [3].   The problematic coincidence behind
this relationship is what led Dirac to speculate that the constant of gravitation must vary
in time [4].

This expression may be reduced to a recognizable form with an important scaling
law that results from the Friedmann and Raychaudhuri equations. The Hubble term H at
any time during the era of matter dominance is given by

(2)
where 
ρ  is  the  density  of  matter  at  that  time.   The  mass  M  contained  within  the
R3ρ,  where  R  is  the  radius  (particle  horizon)  of  the
observable  Universe  is  of  order 
observable Universe.  This leads to GM/R~R2H2.  At all times before vacuum dominance
(except during inflation) the Raychaudhuri equation leads to the relationship

H 2 ~ Gρ

which results in

H~c/R,

This  relationship  was  once  regarded  as  another  problematic  coincidence  among  large
numbers [5].

Using substitutions from Eqs. (3) and (4), Eq. (1) may be manipulated to generate
ρ0 in the Universe, which is expected to

€ 

an expression for the current density of matter 
be of order the critical density 

2 /G :

~ H0

Eq. (5) may be reduced through a scaling relationship that is most likely of no physical
significance.   It  so  happens  that  while  M 0/mN  is  of  order  1080, m Pl/mN  is  of  order  1020
where 

mPl ≡ hc /G  is the Planck mass.  Those two ratios result in

With substitution from Eq. (6), Eq. (5) becomes

The  coincidence  problem  encapsulated  in  the  Eddington-Weinberg  relation  is  thus
equivalently stated in Eq. (7).

The “cosmic coincidence problem” can be expressed as

Λ
G
Λ is the putative cosmological constant that may be causing the expansion of the
where 
Universe to accelerate.  Given that the current density 
ρ0 is of order the critical density
and with substitutions from Eqs.  (3)  and  (4),  the  cosmic  coincidence  problem  may  be
expressed as

Thus  the  Eddington-Weinberg  relation  in  Eq.  (7)  is  equivalent  to  a  statement  of  the
cosmic coincidence problem.   The only other information required is the trival relation
among the mass parameters of the Universe in Eq. (6).

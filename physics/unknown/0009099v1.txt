Photonic band gap materials hold promise as a platform for a new generation of efficient, compact

photonic devices. The initial excitement generated for these materials has been sustained by the discovery of
new physical effects leading to new applications [1]. In this Letter, we present an unexpected conjunction of
strong expansion of the region of phase coherence within the medium and weak divergence of the output
beam, which is made possible in a photonic stop band structure. Our calculations show that a diffusion-like
spreading of the coherent field leads to wide area lasing at the edge of a photonic stop band or at a localized
state in the middle of the stop band. These results are supported by measurements of the spatial profile of laser
emission from a promising organic material – a dye-doped cholesteric liquid crystal [2, ,3]. Since the maximum
excitation energy is proportional to the laser area, large-area thin-film devices provide a new approach for high-
power lasers. These enables lightweight optical sources for free-space communications, coherent backlighting
for 3-D holographic and projection displays, and therapeutic irradiation of large areas of skin.

Periodic dielectric materials in one, two or three dimensions may possess a gap in the photon density of
states in the corresponding number of dimensions [1]. In 3-D periodic structures with sufficient modulation in
the dielectric function, a full photonic band gap may appear in which spontaneous emission is suppressed.

Disturbing the periodicity of an active crystal introduces long-lived localized modes into the photonic band gap
at which lasing is facilitated. Though lasing has not yet been observed in 3-D periodic structures, the enhanced
photon dwell times and microcavity effects in localized states have suppressed the laser threshold in lower
dimensional periodic systems. Unlike lasers based on Fabry-Perot resonators, the band-edge and defect modes
of 1-D structures are significantly separated from adjacent modes and have narrower linewidth than other
modes. They may therefore operate as single mode lasers over a significant power range. The shift of the band
gap with oblique angle at the band-edge frequency only permits the propagation of light with k-vector
components near the normal. Unlike conventional spreading of light between two mirrors, which requires
oblique k-vector components (Fig. 1a), photonic band structures lead to enhanced spreading of light with only
near-normal k-vector components (Fig.1b).

It would appear that the best candidate for a 1-D periodic structure, for large area lasing would be a

vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) [4]. But high order transverse modes arise [5] in small-diameter
VCSEL, while in large-diameter VCSELs spontaneous filamentation results from structural nonuniformities [6].
Another class of periodic one-dimensional structures, which have recently been produced as macroscopic single
domain materials, is that of self-organized polymeric cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) [7]. Lasing at the edge of
the stop band of CLCs has recently been demonstrated [2] and here we will specifically consider measurements
and simulations of these materials.

The molecular director in cholesteric structures lies in a molecular plane and executes a helical rotation
perpendicular to the planes. A stop band centered at a wavelength in the medium equal to the helical pitch P is
created for waves propagating along the helical axis. Optically pumped lasing in dye-doped CLCs occurs at the
first mode at the edges of the stop band at vacuum wavelengths of neP or noP, where ne and no are the
extraordinary and ordinary indices of refraction, respectively. The narrowest mode in CLCs is the first mode on
the high frequency side of the band, which is composed of two counterpropagating components travelling
normal to the layers of the structure and has an electric field everywhere aligned with the lowest index axis of
the optical indicatrix. Consequently lasing generally occurs only in this mode slightly above threshold. For off-
normal incident radiation, the gap shifts to higher frequency, placing oblique waves at the frequency of the
lasing mode inside the stop band. As a result, transmitted or emitted radiation is confined to a narrow range of
angles about the normal direction even for an incident beam with a large angular divergence as shown in Fig.1 b.
The restricted angular distribution corresponds to a wide beam at the output surface of the thin film and hence
to a beam inside the sample with divergence greatly exceeding that of free space diffraction divergence.

The CLC film studied was a right-handed structure with n ~ 1.7 and Dn ~ 0.2 and a thickness of 35 m m.
The samples were doped with laser dye PM-597 with an absorption peak at 530 nm and an emission peak at 590
nm and pumped with 150 ns pulses at the second harmonic of Q-switched pulses of a Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm.
Lasing is produced at the mode closest to the upper band edge. The emitted beam is perpendicular to the CLC
film and produces the pattern on a screen 11.5 cm from the sample shown in the insert in Fig. 3.

The CLC medium is modeled as a set of anisotropic amplifying layers with thickness h significantly

smaller than the wavelength of the incident light. The direction of the molecular axis is rotated between
successive layers by a small angle 2p P/h. A normally incident circularly polarized 1-D Gaussian beam with the
helicity of the CLC structure and frequency of the lasing mode is incident upon the sample. For simplicity of
calculation, we consider an incident beam, which is a superposition of waves with an intensity distribution that is
Gaussian in the plane of incidence (the x-z-plane) and is homogeneous in the perpendicular direction. The main
results obtained for this wave are readily generalized to the case of a Gaussian beam. Transmission is calculated
using a 4 ·
superposed to give the transmitted wave.

The transfer-matrix is computed numerically for each plane wave component by taking the product of

the transfer matrix for each layer of thickness h with uniform dielectric tensor. The value of 
 is decreased until
the value of the transmittance converges. Transmission is simulated in a CLC film with P = 370 nm, thickness L
= 35 m m and extraordinary and ordinary dielectric constants ee and eo which correspond to refractive indices ne =
1.8 and  no =1.6. For the background medium, we use 
substrates. Gain is introduced by adding a negative imaginary part to both ee and eo. The width of the band-edge
mode in the transmission spectrum drops with increasing gain and vanishes at a critical value of the gain at the
laser threshold. At this point, both the transmittance and reflectance diverge.

perpendicularly propagating wave. A typical intensity distribution is shown in linear and logarithmic plots in Fig.

The calculated intensity distribution at the output surface gives rise to an oscillatory structure in the far

field. The measured and calculated far-field intensities are shown in Fig. 3 at a distance of 11.5 cm from the
sample. The agreement is good outside of the central region, but calculations give a flatter peak than is
measured. This is due to the use of a beam with a Gaussian intensity distribution only in one direction and to
the finite gain region created by the pump beam. We now demonstrate analytically that spatial distribution
found is a direct consequence of the Lorentzian shape of the resonant peak of the transmitted electric field,

 is sufficiently small.  Since this condition does not explicitly depend on the sample characteristics, we
expect that it holds also for lasing modes in other layered media, such as binary-layered (BL) media and Fabry-
Perot (FP) resonators. This is demonstrated in Fig. 4, where we plot lr/nbW vs. Dl/lr on a log-log scale for
three arbitrarily chosen systems: (a) CLC ((cid:224) ), (b) BL (

The universal relation in Eq. (4) has a surprising interpretation in terms of diffusion. Since the linewidth
in the transmission spectrum is inversely proportional to the photon dwell time t , Eq. (4) can be interpreted in
terms of the diffusion relation: 

2/(2pcDl). The effective diffusion constant is

background medium and is independent of the sample thickness and gain coefficient. Although we have
assumed the wave is homogeneous in the y direction, this condition can be relaxed in the analytical approach.  If
the incident beam is a Gaussian wave in both the x and y directions, the generalization of the 1-D approach
leads to an outgoing wave:

 should be satisfied. This is similar to the wavefunction found in Eq. (3). These results
may be naturally applied to band-edge or localized modes in periodic 1-D structures since only a singe mode of
radiation exists over a wide angular range centered on the normal direction to yield wide area thin-film lasers.

Abstract 

The  timing  system  of  SPring-8  booster  synchrotron 
generates  various 
timing  signals  concerning  beam 
injection, acceleration from 1 GeV to 8 GeV and ejection. 
We  have  improved  the  timing  system  of  the  synchrotron 
giving it better stability and flexibility. This improvement 
results  the  other  merits  of  advanced  operations,  for 
example,  storing  electron  beam  in  the  synchrotron, 
changing  the  injection  cycle  from  1  Hz  to  the  slower 
frequency 
the  RF  knock-out  (RF-KO) 
operation period and ejecting the low energy beam during

1 INTRODUCTION 
The SPring-8 facility  consists  of  a  1  GeV  linac  with  a 
repetition  rate  of  60  Hz,  a  booster  synchrotron  and  an 
8 GeV storage ring. The timing system installed in the RF 
station  named  E-station  in  the  storage  ring  generates  a 
508.58  MHz  RF  reference  signal  and  a  1-cycle  signal  at 
the  rate  of  1  Hz.  The  1-cycle  signal  includes  the 
information  of  an  RF  bucket  address  in  the  storage  ring. 
The  timing  system  of  the  synchrotron  receives  these 
signals and regenerates many timing signals such as a gun 
trigger, pulse magnet triggers and ramping patterns. For a 
single-bunch  beam  operation  of  the  storage  ring,  an  RF-
KO  system  installed  in  the  synchrotron  rejects  the 
electrons  in  satellite  RF  buckets  around  the  main  bucket 
[1]. 

2 REQUIREMENTS 
There are four requirements for the timing system in the 

synchrotron. 

The  first  is  to  synchronize  the  508.58  MHz  RF  phase 
between  the  synchrotron  and  the  storage  ring  to  control 
the beam filling of storage ring. 

The  second  is  to  suppress  the  time  jitters  between  the 
gun trigger signal and the RF signal of the synchrotron as 
small  as  possible  less  than  100  ps.  The  time  width  of  a 
beam from the linac for a single-bunch beam operation is 
1  ns,  and  the  time  width  of  an  RF  bucket  of  the 
synchrotron is about 2 ns. If the energy spread of a beam 
is  ∆E/E  ≥  1  %  and  the  gun  trigger  timing  changes  over 
100 ps, the portion of the beam is not captured by an RF 
bucket  of  the  synchrotron  and  the  beam  intensity  of  the 
synchrotron  fluctuates.  During  the  single-bunch  beam 
operation,  the  synchrotron  radiation  users  request  the 
uniform beam intensity of each bunch of the storage ring. 
To  realize  it,  the  beam  intensity  from  the  synchrotron 
must be stable. 

The third is to prepare the function to inject multi-pulse 
beam from the linac into the synchrotron and to inject into 

an  RF  bucket  of  the  storage  ring  in  1  cycle  to  shorten 
beam-filling  time  in  the  storage  ring.  The  harmonic 
number of the synchrotron  is  672  and  that  of  the  storage 
ring is 2436. While the RF bucket of the synchrotron turns 
around  29  times,  the  RF  bucket  of  the  storage  ring  turns 
around  8

times.  The  RF  bucket  addresses  of 

The  fourth  is  to  add  the  flexibility  of  the  advanced 
operations of the synchrotron such as storing the electron 
beam  in  the  synchrotron,  changing  the  injection  cycle 
from  1  Hz  to  a  slower  frequency  to  increase  the  RF-KO 
operation period and ejecting the low energy beam during 
ramping up. 

The  timing  system  already  satisfies  the  former  three 
requirements.  However, 
two 
requirements  with  the  higher  precision,  we  improved  the 
RF  low  power  system  last  year.  In  addition,  to  improve 
the  function  to  inject  multi-pulse  beam  and  to  add  the 
flexibility, we improved the timing system this year.

3 THE SYSTEM 

3.1 Optic Fiber Link 

All timing signals are linked in the timing system of the 
synchrotron located  at  the  injector  control  room.  We  use 
two  kinds  of  optic  fibers.  One  is  the  single-mode  phase-
stabilized  optic  fiber  supplied  by  Sumitomo  Electric 
Industries  Ltd.  [2].  This  is  used  for  the  distributions  of 
508.58  MHz  RF  reference  signal  and  precise  timing 
signals such as triggers for an electron gun and fast beam 
monitors. The RF reference signal from the storage ring is 
controlled under a phase-locked loop system (PLL) [3]. In 
addition,  the  RF  reference  signal  to  the  RF  low  power 
system employs the PLL, too. The other one is the multi-
mode graded-index optic fiber  with  core/cladding  size  of 
50/125  µm.  This  is  used  for  the  distributions  of  triggers 

 

for magnets and slow monitors. The measured time jitters 
of this optic fiber system with a fiber length  of  250  m  is 
440 ps as a standard deviation. 

3.2 508MHz SUC 

We  can  correctly  count  the  RF  bucket  number  using 
508.58  MHz  synchronous  universal  counters  (508MHz 
SUC)  [4].  The  508MHz  SUC  generates  a  clock  with  a 
frequency  of  508.58/N  MHz  and  a  delay  time  of 
M/0.50858  ns  from  a  counter  reset  signal.  The  N  and  M 
are positive integers. 

Fig. 1 shows the block diagram of the timing system of 
the  synchrotron.  We  use  two  508MHz  SUC’s  to  control 
multi-pulse  beam.  One  is  to  define  the  injection  timing 
and  is  set  N  =  672.  The  other  is  to  define  the  ejection 
timing and is set N = 2436×8 = 19488. The delay counts 

of  M  for  two  508MHz  SUC’s  are  also  summarized  in 
Table  1.  We  set  the  beam  filling  of  the  synchrotron  and 
the  ejection  timing  to  the  8-pulse  controller  as  shown  in 
Fig.  1  by  using  a  VME  digital  out  (DO)  board.  This 
controller  controls  the  number  of  pulse  and  the  delay 
count M’s of two 508MHz SUC’s for each pulse. 

A 508MHz SUC is used for a gun trigger signal. If the 
trigger  signal  has  some  time  jitters,  the  508MHz  SUC 
synchronizes  the  trigger  signal  with  the  RF  reference 
again.  Therefore,  jitters  smaller  than  2  ns  is  completely 
cured.  A  phase  shifter  in  front  of  this  508MHz  SUC 
adjusts finely the timing of beam injection. 

To  generate  the  ramping  patterns  of  the  main  magnets 
and  the  acceleration  voltage  (Vacc)  using  the  VME  fast 
DO  [5],  a  10  kHz  clock  is  also  generated  by  a  508MHz 
SUC.

PLL. The combined RF signals are furthermore combined 
and total RF signal is used as the inputs of the Vacc PLL 
and the Vacc ALC (Auto Level Control feedback system). 
The Vacc PLL keeps the phase of total RF signal constant. 
The  VME  fast  DO  board  generates  the  ramping  pattern 
used  as  the  reference  signal  of  Vacc  ALC.  One  of  the 
Cavity PLL’s controls a phase shifter using the Vacc ALC 
output as a reference and the other controls another phase 
shifter using the Vacc ALC output with reversed polarity. 
The  relation  of  the  phase  between  two  klystron  outputs 
and the Vacc during 1 cycle is shown in Fig. 3. 

 

3.3 VME Digital Delay 

To  discharge  the  pulse  magnets  such  as  kickers  and 
septums  for  beam  injection  and  ejection,  we  adopt  VME 
6  channel  digital  delay  boards,  Berkeley  Nucleonics 
Corporation B951-2. The measured maximum time jitters 
at maximum delay of 167.8 ms is 0.9 ns. For multi-bunch 
beam operation, the time width of a beam from the linac is 
40  ns  and  the  kicker  magnets  have  60  ns  flattop  pulse 
width. The jitters is negligible. 

3.4 Phase Control of RF Signal 

 

The phase control part in the RF low power system of 
the synchrotron is shown in Fig. 2. We have two klystrons 
and  each  output  power  is  provided  into  four  5-cell  RF 
cavities. To make the beam acceptance larger, we control 
Vacc  by  changing  the  RF  phase  between  two  klystron 
outputs, keeping the RF voltage of the cavities constant. 

The  RF  signals  from  the  pick-up  port  of  four  cavities 
receiving the RF power from one klystron are combined. 
The  combined  signal  is  used  as  the  input  of  the  Cavity 

functions  to  pause  and  to  restart  the  ramping  are  already 
prepared.

4 PERFORMANCE 
A fluctuation of the RF phase between the synchrotron 
and the storage ring is less than 0.3 degree by PLL’s. We 
can  correctly  control  the  RF  bucket  position  to  inject  a 
beam. 

The  measured  time  jitters  of  a  gun  trigger  to  the  RF 
signal is 18 ps as a standard deviation. The intensity of the 
beam  with  1  ns  time  width  fluctuates  about  5  %,  mainly 
due to other causes. 
Fig.  4  shows 

the 
synchrotron  during  1  cycle  when  eight  pulses  with  1  ns 
time width are injected and ejected. The Bending Magnet 
(BM) current is also drawn which represents the ramping 
pattern of the beam energy from 1 GeV to 8 GeV. We can 
control  the  beam  intensity  by  changing  the  number  of 
injected pulse to the synchrotron in eight steps.

We  started  the  study  to  eject  the  low  energy  beam 
during ramping up for low energy operation at the storage 
ring. We are planning to use the synchrotron as a storage 
ring with energy ranges from 0.45 GeV to 4.8 GeV. The

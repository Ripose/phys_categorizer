Abstract 
It is shown that the addition law of relativistic velocities leads to the fundamental 
equations of relativistic dynamics. 

 
 
Chrysos[1] considers that the introduction of the fundamental relationship

in a few hours course on special relativity for beginners is a delicate task. He derives it 
and 
“economically” starting with an useful formula which relates the velocities 
(cid:71)
v ' v ' , v '

  of  the  same  particle  relative  to  the  reference  frames  R  and  R’,  the  latter

moving with velocity  V  in the positive direction of the overlapped axes OX and O’X’ of 
R  and  R’  respectively  which  are  in  the  standard  arrangement.  In  the  best  tradition  of 
teaching  relativistic  dynamics, 
invokes  collisions,  conservation  of 
momentum, and mass. 
The purpose of our Note is to derive transformation equations for momentum, mass and 
energy in which we use the addition law of relativistic velocities

A simple collision considered from R and R’ respectively and using the transformation 
equations derived above leads to the conservation of mass (energy) and momentum. 
The concepts of rest energy and kinetic energy are a natural consequence of the results 
obtained  so  far.  If  the  particle  is  at  rest  in  R’,  observers  of  that  frame  measure  its  rest 
0E . Taking into account that the single supplementary energy a free particle can 
energy 
possess  is  its  kinetic  energy 
KE   associated  with  the  fact  that  the  particle  moves  with 
constant velocity  V  relative to K, is given by 
KE
We  consider  that  such  a  way  to  present  relativistic  dynamics  is  time  saving  increasing 
the pedagogical outcome (understanding/time invested). It avoids collisions, the learning 
and the teaching of which, puts under a hard trial the memory of the teacher and of the 
learner as well[2].

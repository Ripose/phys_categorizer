in attosecond time scale 

Ivan P. Christov 

Physics Department, Sofia University, 1164 Sofia, Bulgaria 

Abstract 

Here the ionization and high harmonic generation in Hydrogen and Helium by using 
quantum (hydrodynamic) trajectories is analyzed theoretically. The quantum trajectories allow 
a self-contained treatment of the electron exchange and correlation effects without introducing 
ad  hoc  potentials  into  the  Schrödinger  equation.  Our  approach  predicts  the  correct  high 
harmonic spectra and the attosecond pulses generated by the Helium atom beyond the single 
active  electron  approximation.  It  can  be  used  to  study  complex  multi-electron  systems  and 
their interaction with laser field of both high and low intensity.

1.  Introduction 

The recent progress in laser technology has led to the generation of electromagnetic pulses 
with  duration  of  few  femtoseconds  in  visible  and  below  one  femtosecond  in  the  XUV  (for 
recent  review  see  [1]).    The  availability  of  such  sort  pulses  with  excellent  coherence  can 
facilitate the time resolved study of processes which involve detailed electron motion within 
atoms, molecules, and nanostructures, providing in this way a wealth of new information in 
different  fields  of  science  and  technology.  The  theoretical  research  conducted  so  far  in  the 
field of laser-atom interactions has been focused mainly on processes that involve ionization 
of the atoms under the influence of powerful optical pulses. Different approaches have been 
used  to  describe  the  nonperturbative  motion  of  the  electrons  and  their  interaction  with  the 
nucleus,  which  produce  high  order  harmonics  and  attosecond  pulses.  These  approaches 
include the ab initio solution of the Schrödinger equation in dimensions up to three, and for at 
most  two  electrons  [2].  Semi-classical  models  have  been  developed  for  strong  field  regime, 
such  as  the  strong  field  approximation  (SFA)  which  assumes  that  before  the  ionization  the 
core  potential  dominates  while  afterwards  the  laser  field  governs  the  electron  dynamics  [3]. 
This picture  is encompassed by  a three-step model [4] which uses (semi-) classical electron 
trajectories  which  are  closely  related  to  the  quasi-classical  action.  Although  is  provides  a 
convenient  description,  because  of  its  ad  hoc  elements  the  three  step  model  cannot  be 
considered to be a self-contained theory. For example, SFA reproduces well the high-energy 
range  of  the  high-harmonic  spectrum  but  not  so  well  the  low-energy  part  of  the  spectrum 
which  is  more  influenced  by  the  Coulomb  potential.  Alternative  approach  that  is  aimed  to 
describe  the  electron  correlation  in  strong  field  ionization  discards  all  quantum  mechanical 
effects  and  employs  classical  trajectories,  which  can  display  the  characteristic  sequence  of 
stages of non-sequential double ionization [5]. 

 
In  most  cases  the  calculations  based  on  (semi-)  classical  trajectories  are  intended  to 
substitute  for  the  direct  numerical  solution  of  the  Schrödinger  equation  which  can  be 
prohibitively  time-expensive  for  multi-electron  systems.  Recently,  a  different  approach  to 
laser-atom  interactions  was  proposed,  which  relies  on  quantum  (hydrodynamic)  trajectories 
that  are  calculated  in  a  self-contained  manner,  together  with  the  numerical  solution  of  the 
Schrödinger  equation  [6].  Unlike  the  classical  and  semi-classical  trajectories,  the  quantum 
trajectories  are  “quantum”  in  sense  that  besides  the  classical  forces  they  experience  also 
specific quantum forces (see e.g. [7]). One of the most compelling reasons for using quantum 
trajectories  is  that  they  can  provide  a  robust  approach  for  systems  with  more  degrees  of 
freedom. It was shown in [6] that the problem for ionization of 1D Helium atom in a strong 
laser fields can be reduced to solution of two  1D Schrödinger equations and two first  order 
equations for the velocity fields of the two electrons, where the e-e correlation is included ab 
initio into the calculations. In principle, the reduction of any multi-electron problem to a set of 
single-electron  problems  while  preserving  the  essential  quantum  dynamics  is  an  important 
advantage  since  it  allows  a  self-contained  treatment  of  the  interaction  of  complex  multi-
electron systems with laser fields of arbitrary strength, e.g. where there is no ionization and 
therefore  the  semi-classical  trajectories  may  be  inadequate.  In  this  Letter  we  apply  the 
quantum  trajectories  method  to  high  harmonic  generation  (HHG)  and  attosecond  pulse 
generation from one- and two-electron atoms. 
 

2.  Models and results 

The advantage of the method proposed in [6] as compared to the standard hydrodynamic 
formulation of quantum mechanics [7] is that it avoids the solution of the quantum Hamilton-
Jacobi equations which are nonlinear and contain quantum potentials. Instead, a set of linearly

coupled time dependent Schrödinger equations for the individual electrons and equations for 
the trajectories are solved. For one-electron systems where there is no electron correlation the 
quantum trajectories may help for visualization and interpretation of the results and they may 
give new insights into the quantum dynamics. However, the quantum trajectories can play a 
crucial  role  for  multi-electron  systems  where  the  momentary  position  of  each  electron 
participates  in  the  Schrödinger  equations  for  the  rest  of  the  electrons  so  that  the  quantum 
waves and the classical particles participate into the dynamics on an equal footing. 
 

2.1 Hydrogen 

  
It  has  been  shown  previously  that  one  of  the  most  interesting  regimes  of  atom-field 
interaction takes place for laser pulses with duration of a few optical cycles. Then, the cut-off 
harmonics of the spectrum merge in a broad band that corresponds to an isolated attosecond 
pulse  [8,9].  First,  we  consider  the  quantum  trajectories  calculation  for  the  interaction  of  1D 
Hydrogen  atom  with  a  few-cycle  laser  pulse.  For  this  purpose  the  following  equations  are 
solved numerically:

Equation  (1b)  determines  the  time  dependence  of  the  quantum  trajectory  x(t)  of  an 
electron that is guided by the pilot wave Ψ(x,t) (see e.g.[7]), where A(t) is the vector potential. 
In this case, the coordinate x(t) is determined at each time step, after the wave function has 
been calculated from Eq.1a. First, the ground state is calculated by propagating the initial trial 
wave-packet Ψ(x,t=0) in complex time until steady state in the electron energy is established. 
Simultaneously, an initial ensemble of randomly distributed coordinates x(t=0) is propagated 
according to eq.1b, where at steady state the RHS in Eq.1b goes to zero and all particles stand 
still. It has been shown previously [6] that the statistical distribution of the particle ensemble 
after steady state is reached matches very well the ground state  probability as calculated  by 
the  stationery  wave  function  from  Eq.1a.  For  these  parameters  the  ground  state  energy  of  -
0.67 a.u. is obtained. Next, the time evolution in presence of the laser field is calculated. Since 
the the laser field can be strong, large portions of the wave function are pushed away from the 
nucleus  and  some  of  those  may  return  at  each  reversal  of  the  field.  The  electromagnetic 
radiation  from  the  atom  can  be  calculated  by  using  the  quantum  expectation  value  of  the 
dipole  moment,  and  independently  by  using  the  classical  radiation  formula  for  the 
contributions coming from each trajectory x(t). These two approaches are independent in that 
the quantum trajectories x(t) are not directly related to any quantum averages, such like the 
dipole moment. However, the quantum trajectories can be considered to represent the motion 
of small volumes of the electron probability distribution in accordance with the hydrodynamic 
formulation [7]. Figure 1 shows the results from the calculation of the harmonic spectrum for 
5 fs laser pulse with peak intensity 5 1014 W/cm2 (λ=800 nm) for zero carrier-envelope offset 
(CEO)  in  Fig.1a  and  for  π/2  CEO  in  Fig.1b.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  spectrum  calculated  by

using as many as 20 quantum trajectories (dashed line) matches very well the result from the 
dipole  acceleration  (solid  lines)  for  both  CEO’s.  This  correspondence  spans  essentially  the 
whole  harmonic  spectrum,  which  contrasts  the  predictions  from  the  SFA  where  only  the 
highest harmonics are well reproduced by the contributions from the semi-classical electron

trajectories.  The  quantum  trajectories  are  plotted  with  dotted  lines  in  Fig.1c,d  together  with 
the  attosecond  pulses  which  are  synthesized  from the  cut-off  bands  of  the  two  spectra.  It  is 
seen  from  these  plots  that  the  emission  of  the  attosecond  pulse  corresponds  to  the  return  of 
groups of quantum trajectories to the core. Clearly, these trajectories correspond to portions of 
the electron cloud which are accelerated by the laser pulse, as the picture is similar for zero 
and  π/2  CEO.  It  is  seen  that  besides  the  ionizing  trajectories  there  are  other  outgoing 
trajectories which however do not produce attosecond pulses, which can be attributed to the 
lower energies of these trajectories or to the destructive interference of their contributions to 
the overall scattered field. In fact, the excellent agreement between the spectra calculated by 
using  the  time  dependent  wave-function  and  by  using  quantum  trajectories  proves  that  the 
latter are capable to account very precisely for the quantum motion within the electron cloud 
as it oscillates around the  core. That motion is inevitably reflected to the amplitude and the 
phase of the scattered waves and hence to the high harmonic spectrum which is sensitive to 
small fluctuations. 
 

2.2 Helium 

According to the model reported in [6], the interaction of 1D Helium atom with laser 
pulse is described by two coupled Schrödinger equations, for the two single-electron orbitals 
φ1(x1,t) and φ2(x2,t):

term in RHS of eq.2a, which represents the time-dependent Coulomb potential experienced by 
each  electron  due  to  the  presence  of  the  other  one.  The  time-dependent  trajectories  which 
enter that term are calculated by using the de Broglie-Bohm relation:

where  the  two-partite  wave  function  of  the  Helium  atom  Ψ(x1,x2,t)  in  Eq.2b  can  be 
represented either as a simple product of the two spatial orbitals φ1,2(x,t) for distinguishable 
electrons,  or  as  symmetrized  (anti-symmetrized)  product  of  these  orbitals  for  equivalent  
electrons. We consider here both cases because they feature different physical situations that 
are  of  interest.  First,  the  ground  state  of  the  atom  is  determined  by  propagating  Eqs.2a,b  in 
complex  time  until  steady  state  is  established.  Our  model  yields  ground  state  energy  of  -
2.3269  a.u.  for  the  atom,  and  ionization  potential  -0.865  a.u.  for  the  outer  electron.  For  the 
same set of parameters the iterative solution of the Hartree-Fock equations give -2.3234 a.u. 
and  -0.842  a.u.,  respectively,  while  the  direct  diagonalization  of  the  2D  Hamiltonian  gives 
ground state energy of -2.3266 a.u.. Therefore, a large portion of the ground state correlation 
energy is taken into account by eqs.2a,b. In order to elucidate the role of the electron-electron 
correlation potential in eq.2a we conducted detailed calculations of the HHG spectra and the 
ionization yields for distinguishable and equivalent electrons.

Figure 2 shows the results for HHG from Helium with two equivalent electrons, for 5 
fs  laser  pulse  with  peak  intensity  6.87  1014  W/cm2  and  zero  CEO.  Although  only  100 
trajectories are used in that calculation the harmonic spectra generated by the two ensembles 
of  particles  and  waves,  according  to  Eqs.2,  are  practically  identical  as  it  is  expected  for 
equivalent  electrons  (Fig.2a).  It  was  verified  that  these  spectra  are  also  very  close  to  the 

 

5

spectrum  obtained  from  the  solution  for  the  “exact”  1D  Helium  where  the  two-dimensional 
Schrödinger equation is to be integrated (see e.g. [10]). The ionization yield is calculated by 
projecting the time dependent wavefunction on the ground state, thus eliminating the role of 
the  grid  boundaries  (the  grid  size  for  this  calculation  is  200  a.u.).  Figure  3  shows  that  the 
ionization close to the end of the laser pulse is practically identical for the exact solution and 
for  our  model.  It  is  important  to  point  out  that  the  sensitivity  of  the  ionization  on  the 
correlation potential is a good test for the validity of the model that we use. For example, if 
the smoothing parameter in the correlation potential in eq.2a is decreased from 1.5 to 1.2 the 
ionization changes from 19% (Fig.3) up to 33.5%, again equally for both the exact solution 
and our model. It is seen from Fig.2b that the trajectory dynamics and the attosecond pulses 
that correspond to the spectra in Fig.2a are similar to the case of Hydrogen (Fig.1a,c), that can 
be expected for Helium with equivalent electrons.

Figure 3. Degree of ionization for equivalent and distinguishable electrons.  
The dashed line shows the “exact” result. 
 

One additional advantage when using quantum trajectories is that these can be selected 
according  to  certain  rules.  This  allows  to  fine  tune  the  parameters  of  the  model  for 
observation of different physical situations. A good example in this context is the HHG from 
Helium atom with distinguishable electrons. In this case the total wave function is written as a 
simple  product  of  the  two  distinct  orbitals  but  these  are  treated  in  a  symmetric  way,  i.e.  no 
single active electron approximation is used for the outer electron (as this is done in the so-
called  Crapola  model  [11]).  Instead,  trajectory  selection  is  employed  in  order  to  distinguish 
the inner and the outer electron. In our calculation the trajectories are selected before the laser 
pulse, so that the ground energy for the particles of each couple differs by at least 0.05 a.u.. 
The results from the interaction of Helium atom with distinguishable electrons with 5 fs laser 
pulse  are  plotted  in  Fig.4.  In  contrast  to  the  case  of  equivalent  electrons  (Fig.2),  here  the 
spectra  due  to  the  two  electrons  differ  significantly.  It  is  seen  that  both  electrons  generate 
harmonics with well defined cut-off. However, the intensity of the spectrum due to the inner 
electron  is  lower  by  two  orders  of  magnitude  than  the  spectrum  due  to  the  outer  electron. 
Also,  the  cut-off  for  the  inner  electron  is  shifted  to  the  higher  frequencies  by  11  harmonic 
orders,  which  corresponds  exactly  to  the  difference  between  the  ionization  potentials  of  the 
two electrons (0.597 a.u.). It is seen from Fig.4b that the outer trajectories are much easier to 
ionize  than  the  inner  trajectories  and  that  the  attosecond  pulse  is  generated  by  outer 
trajectories  which  return  to  the  core.  Clearly,  in  this  regime  the  results  from  the  quantum 
trajectory  calculations  comply  with  those  from  the  single  active  electron  approximation, 
where only the outer electron is considered [2]. Besides the harmonic spectra, the ionization 
yields also differ significantly for the inner and the outer electron, as it is seen in Fig.3. As

expected, the ionization after the laser pulse for equivalent electrons equals the mean value of 
the ionizations for distinguishable electrons.

3.  Conclusions 

The models developed here prove that quantum (hydrodynamic) trajectories can be very 
useful  for  calculation  and  visualization  of  the  outcome  of  laser-atom  interactions.  The 
electron-electron  correlation  can  be  accounted  for  ab  initio  by  using  quantum  trajectories. 
This formalism allows one to unambiguously calculate the separate harmonic spectra radiated 
from  the  inner  and  the  outer  electron  in  Helium,  without  imposing  restrictions  on  the 
governing equations.

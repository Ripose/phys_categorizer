Abstract 

We concentrate on several relatively new aspects of the study of fast electron scattering by 
atoms  and  atom-like  objects,  namely  endohedral  atoms  and  fullerenes.  We  show  that  the 
corresponding  cross  sections,  being  expressed  via  so-called  Generalized  Oscillator  Strengths 
(GOS),  give  information  on  the  electronic  structure  of  the  target  and  on  the  role  of  electron 
correlations  in  it.  We  consider  what  sort  of  information  became  available  when  analyzing  the 
dependence of GOS upon their multipolarity, transferred momentum  q and energy ω.  

We demonstrate the role of nondipole corrections in the small-angle fast-electron inelastic 
scattering.  There  dipole  contribution  dominates  while  non-dipole  corrections  can  be 
considerably  and  controllably  enhanced  as  compared  to  the  case  of  low  and  medium  energy 
photoionization.  We  show  also  that  analyses  of  GOS  for  discrete  level  excitations  permit  to 
clarify their multipolarity. 

The results of calculations of Compton excitation and ionization cross-sections for noble gas 

atoms are presented. 

Attention  is  given  to  cooperative  effects  in  inelastic  fast  electron  –  atom  scattering  that 
results  in  directed  motion  of  the  secondary  electrons,  a  phenomenon  that  is  similar  to  “drag 
currents” in photoionization. 

We demonstrate how one should derive GOS for endohedral atoms, e.g.

 and what 

is the additional information that can be obtained from corresponding GOS.  
Most of discussions are illustrated by the results of concrete calculations.

Introductory remarks 

1. 
Fast  electrons  interact  relatively  weak  with  the  target  charges.  Therefore,  the  respective 
inelastic  cross-sections,  apart  of  being  interesting  for  different  applied  areas  of  science  and 
technology,  supply  information  on  the  transition  probabilities  and  ionization  of  the  target 
objects. Thus, they give important knowledge about the electronic wave function of the target in 
its initial and final states, i.e. before and after interaction with the fast electron. 

Since  long  ago  it  has  been  recognized  that  the  fast  charge  particle  (including  electrons) 
inelastic scattering cross-section can be presented as a product of two factors solely dependent 
upon  the  properties  of  the  projectile  and  target,  respectively  [2].  All  features  of  the  target  are 
collected  in  the  so-called  Generalized  Oscillator  Strengths  (GOS).  Their  definition  and  main 

                                                 
∗/It is my pleasure indeed to present this paper, in fact a short review, to a volume of Proceedings of a 
Symposium dedicated to the 70th birthday of Prof. Dr. Russell A. Bonham. His great contribution to the 
field of theoretical and experimental study of the excitation and ionization of atoms and molecules using 
electron  scattering  and  coincidence  techniques  is  widely  acknowledged.  His  papers  in  the  field  were 
published already as earlier as more than forty years [1]

[4])  

The  use  of  fast  electrons  as  a  tool  to  study  the  targets  internal  structure  has  definite 
advantages as compared to photoionization that is also powerful in investigating the structure of 
the target. The main advantage is the ability of fast electrons to excite not only dipole transitions, 
but  also  transitions  of  other  multipolarity.  It  is  also  essential  that  the  GOS  are,  unlike 
photoionization  cross-sections,  dependent  not  only  upon  the  transferred  to  the  atom  energy  ω 
but  also  transferred  momentum  q .  As  a  result  the  GOS  are  able  to  check  the  targets  wave 
functions at different distances. 

It  is  essential  to  have  in  mind  that  the  fast  electron  inelastic  scattering  cross-sections  are 
much  bigger  than  that  of  photoionization.  On  the  other  hand,  the  disadvantage  of  inelastic 
electron scattering as compared to photoionization is the relatively big role played by interaction 
between the projectile and target before and after the target ionization or excitation takes place.  

Although  known  since  long  ago  and  being  a  relatively  simple  method  of  receiving 
information  on  targets  structure,  even  called  “synchrotron  for  pure  men”,  the  inelastic  fast 
electron  scattering  still  has  a  lot  of  resources.  The  ability  of  this  approach  is  far  from  being 
exhausted. A lot was done recently in this domain, including problems of small angle scattering, 
minima in GOS etc, which is illustrated by the prominent number of recent publications (see e.g. 
[5-11]).  

The content of this brief review will be some of the recent results obtained in this direction 

by my colleagues and me, and outlining some nearest perspectives in this area of research.  

By  studying  GOS  one  can  obtain  information  on  electron  correlations  of  different 
multipolarity,  which  is  almost  impossible  in  photoionization  studies.  Indeed,  we  will  present 
results  demonstrating  for  noble  gas  atoms  the  big  difference  [12]  between  one-electron  GOS 
obtained  in  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  approximation,  and  that  taking  into  account  the  deviation  from 
the  one-electron  picture  in  the  frame  of  the  Random  Phase  Approximation  with  Exchange 
(RPAE) [13, 14]. The correlations proved to be important for dipole and at least for quadrupole 
channels of the target ionization in a big domain of q [12].  

It was demonstrated recently, that it is great interest to study photoionization in atoms with 
semi-filled electron subshells, where strong dependence of the cross-sections upon term  of the 
residual  ion  was  found  [15].  We  suggest  that  the  same  problem  could  be  of  interest  in  GOS 
studies. Of special interest is the case of GOS for 3d electrons in Xe, Cs and Ba, where the role 
2/53d was clarified and proved to be very important [16], similar to the case 
of 
2/53d
of  photoionization  [17].  Note  that  in  calculations  the 
  levels  were  treated  as 
semi-filled subshells. 

 level upon

  and 

It appeared that by investigating GOS of discrete levels we can determine their multipolarity 
or  disclose  the  presence  of  e.g.  two  closely  located  discrete  levels,  otherwise  almost 
indistinguishable  [18,  19].  As  it  was  demonstrated  in  [19],  the  experimentally  observed  3p-4p 
level  is  mainly  monopole,  while  the  experimentalists  claimed  that  it  is  quadrupole  [20].  It 
appeared  that  the  RPAE  correlations  affect  considerably  the  position  and  magnitude  of  the 
minima in GOS of discrete levels [21]. 

Note that at small  q  GOS tend to ordinary dipole oscillator strengths (OSO) at any projectile 
energy [22]. With growth of  q non-dipole corrections become increasingly important. Although 
they can be detected in the angular distributions of photoelectrons even at not too high photon 
frequencies ω[23], the relative role of these corrections is much smaller there than it can be in

GOS.  In  the  latter  case  varying  the  transferred  momentum  can  controllably  change  the  non-
dipole terms contribution. 

Similar to the case of photoionization, inelastic electron scattering leads to creation of the so-
called  “drag  current”  [24]  –  a  coherent  cooperative  movement  of  ionized  electrons,  the 
estimation of which will be performed in this paper. 

Compton scattering and excitation cross-sections can be expressed via respective GOS. We 
will present results obtained for Compton scattering on noble gases [25] and on discrete levels 
excitation [26].  

We will present semi- qualitative analyses of GOS for endohedral atoms, e.g. 

,  at 
first,  the  manifestation  of  so-called  confinement  resonances,  which  were  discussed  recently  in 
60C ,  namely  the  influence  of  its 
photoionization  [27].  We  will  analyze  also  another  effect  of 
dynamic polarization [28] upon the dependence of GOS of the atom A located inside the fulleren 
shell upon frequency and angular momentum.

The  multi-electron  correlations  we  will  take  into  account  in  the  frame  of  well-known

The equations (6) and (7) determine the RPAE values for the GOS of continuous spectrum 
and  discrete  excitations.  Some  time  ago  calculations  of  GOS  for  continuous  spectrum  were 
performed for the following subshells of noble gas atoms: 2s2 and 2p6 in Ne, 3s2 and 3p6 in Ar, 
3d10, 4s2 and 4p6 in Kr, 4d10, 5s2 and 5p6 in Xe [12]. The results were obtained in one-electron 
HF approximations and with account of multi-electron correlations in the frame of RPAE. The 
transferred linear momentum  q varied from zero to 2 atomic units and the transferred energy ω 
varies from ionization threshold to 5-8Ry. We took into account four values of the transferred 
angular momentum 
. It appeared that the role of RPAE corrections is the biggest in the 
dipole channel, L=1, but also quite noticeable in the quadrupole channel, L=2, also.

Intradoublet correlations

It  was  demonstrated  recently  that  due  to  interaction  between  electrons  belonging  to  two

 and 

Of interest is to investigate how the intra-doublet interaction is reflected in GOG, namely in 
its dipole component as a function of q and learn how this interaction is manifested in transitions 
of  other  multipolarity,  namely  monopole,  quadrupole  and  octupole.  This  rather  complicated

calculation can be considerably simplified if one treats electrons belonging to 
levels  as,  approximately,  two  closed  subshells  of  equal  number  of  spin  “up”  and  “down” 
electrons.

 and 

Corresponding generalization of (7) to a system of two kinds of electrons was developed in 
[29]  and  adjusted  to  the  case  on  3d  spin  doublet  in  [17].  Another  effect  beyond  RPAE  that  is 
essential for deep subshells like 3d in Xe, Cs and Ba is rearrangement, that is the modification of 
the  outer  electrons’  state  while  the  inner  electron  leaves  the  atom.  All  this  leads  to  the 
approximation,  the  name  of  which  has  been  abbreviated  as  SP  GRPAE  that  means  Spin 
Polarized Generalized RPAE.  
  Using  just  this  approach,  the  GOS  for  dipole,  monopole  and  quadrupole  transitions  were

Identification of discrete levels 

4. 
An  interesting  application  of  GOS  studies  is  the  detection  of  the  angular  momentum  of 
discrete  transitions.  Relatively  recently  the  GOS  of  the  lowest  non-dipole  transition  in  Ar, 
3 → ,  was  measured  [20]  and  on  the  ground  of  obtained  data  has  been  identified  as 
quadrupole.  It  was  soon  demonstrated  that  the  experimental  accuracy  achieved  in  [20]  is  not

Fig. 3. HF (dots) and RPAE (heavy line) GOS of 3p-4p 
transitions. (a) – monopole, (b) – quadrupole [18] 

Since  the  quadrupole  levels 
are decaying faster than the monopole ones, namely by emitting one quadrupole photon instead 
of two dipole photons, the excited atoms with remain in their monopole state. It seems that by 
measuring the quadrupole photon  yield one can reliably distinguish the quadrupole excitations 
from the monopole. 
Of particular interest is the consideration of dipole discrete excitation GOS, e.g. 3p-4s in Ar, 
 
where long ago a minimum was predicted [1] and much later found in experiment [30]. Note that 
quite  recently  it  was  demonstrated  [31]  that  the  electron  correlations  are  not  important  while 
exchange is important in location of the position and value of the GOS  minimum in Ar 3p-4s 
excitation. 
The GOS of outer shell discrete dipole excitations, e.g. 3p-4d in Ar, are of interest since are 
 
2q  
very close in energy to octupole excitations with the same configuration. While at very small 
the  dipole  contribution  absolutely  dominates,  the  quadrupole  GOS  increases  very  fast,  so  that

it is much bigger than the dipole [32]. This feature is typical for all noble gas 
2q  opens the possibility 

already at 
atoms [32]. The high probability of octupole excitations at not too big 
of creating a gas volume with a large number of atoms in octupole-excited states. 
 

5.  Small q non-dipole corrections 
 
Investigation  of  non-dipole  transitions  in  angular  distributions  of  photoelectrons  permitted 
experimental investigation of atomic quadrupole continuous transition matrix elements [33]. The 
investigations  were  inspired  by  the  following  expression  for  the  angular  distribution  of 
photoelectrons from the nl subshell [34, 35, 36, 24]:

The  prominent  defect 
 
of  using  equation  (13)  as  a 
tool  to  study  quadrupole

continuous 
transition  originates  from  the  smallness  of  the  parameter  κ  in  the  non-relativistic  domain,  in 
particular close to thresholds of the outer atomic shells, where

that equation (13) does not include any information about monopole excitations. 
Both  these  minuses  could  be  eliminated  if  to  consider  small  q  inelastic  fast  electron 
 
scattering  by  atoms.  To  illustrate  this,  let  us  concentrate  for  simplicity  on  ionization  of  an  s-
subshell only. For this case the following formula can be obtained for the differential in angle of 
the ionized atomic electron cross-section, if one limits consideration with monopole, dipole and 
quadrupole transitions only*/:

It is seen that inelastic electron scattering is able to supply information on the monopole and 
quadrupole  parameters  simultaneously.  It  is  important  that  by  changing  q  one  can  control  the 
contribution of the non-dipole terms and thus enhance considerably the ability to measure them. 
However, in order to do this coincidence experiment is required, in which simultaneously two 
final-state electrons, the fast inelastic scattered and the relatively slow removed from the target, 
would be detected. 
 
The  relative  contribution  of  non-dipole  terms  can  be  essentially  enhanced  due  to  the 
presence of monopole and quadrupole autoionization resonances, and suppressed by the dipole 
resonances. 
  With  growth  of  q  up  to

Similar to the case of photoionization [34, 24], where the term proportional to

(13) leads to forward-backward asymmetry, is the case of fast-electron small-angle scattering. In 
the  case  of  photoionization  this  asymmetry  results  in  so-called  “drag  currents”  presenting 
directed motion of photoelectrons in a gas volume irradiated by a beam of photons. The current

Slow electrons knocked-out off the target in the process of fast –electron inelastic scattering,

Compton scattering is of particular interest at high photon energies E, where it eventually 
becomes bigger than the photoionization cross-section. For He it happens already at  keV6

Recently, numerical calculations were performed for Compton scattering cross-sections [25, 
26] of ionization and discrete excitations of several lowest levels. Noble gas atoms Ne, Ar, Kr 
and  Xe  were  considered.  Contributions  were  taken  into  account  of  transitions  with  transferred 
at. un. The results are exemplified in Fig. 5

and Fig. 6.

 and 

Fig.  5  presents  the  results  for  Compton  ionization  of  Kr  3d  electrons.  It  is  seen  that  the 
cross-section is dominated by a powerful maximum that is preceded by a minimum. It appeared 
that with the growth of ω bigger and bigger q values became increasingly important. In order to 
calculate the total Compton cross-sections one needs to know the GOS values at high q. In the 
process  of  calculations  it  became  clear  that  for  such  cross-sections  we  need  to  have  GOS  that

Fig. 6 depicts the Compton cross-section of excitation of Kr 4p-5p two very close located 
levels, namely monopole and quadrupole. Monopole cross-section has one big maximum, while 
the  quadrupole  has  two.  Experimentally,  they  are  almost  inseparable  at  high  E ,  and  therefore 
the sum of monopole and quadrupole terms is also presented in the figure.  
 

8.  GOS of endohedral atoms 
Since recently a lot of attention is given to studies, yet at this moment only theoretical, of 
photoionization of so-called endohedral atom. This is an atom A located in the empty space of a 
fullerene  F ,  that  is  a  highly  symmetric  structure  of  carbon  atoms  C  located  at  a  surface. 
Endohedral atom is denoted as 

FA@ . Best known is the fulleren C60. In essence, the system  

12 

extra 

FA@   can  be  considered 
as  an  extended  artificial 
atom,  which  is  formed  by 
an 
really  multi-
electron shell, added to A. 
 
Just  as  in  an  ordinary 
atom,  the  inter-shell  and 
intra-shell  correlations  [13] 
are  essential  and  can  be 
treated similarly to ordinary 
subshells  of  many-electron 
atoms.

The  first  factor  is  the 
reflection  of  the  ionized 
from  atom  A  electron  by 
the  fullerenes  shell:  This 
factor  manifests  itself  in 
interference  patterns  in  the 
ionization  cross-section  as 
a function of the energy  ε 
of 
ionized 
from  F.  The  second  effect 
is  the  modification  of  the 
interaction  between 
the 
projectile  and  atom  A  due 
to virtual or real excitations 
of  the  fulleren  F  electron 
shell.

9. Conclusions and Perspectives 
We  have  presented  here  a  number  of  novel  results  obtained  in  the  investigation  on  fast 
electron  inelastic  scattering  and  its  main  characteristics  -  the  GOS.  We  demonstrated  that  the 
GOS  are  strongly  affected  by  electron  correlations.  We  have  discussed  intra-doublet 
correlations, identification of discrete levels, non-dipole corrections to small angle fast electron

inelastic  scattering,  cooperative  “drag  currents”,  and  Compton  scattering.  We  argued  that 
endohedral atoms are promising new objects for GOS studies. 

A  number  of  effects  and  processes  were  not  discussed  mainly  due  to  lack  of  space.  For 
instance,  we  did  not  present  reliable  arguments  (although  deserving  experimental  verification) 
that  the  role  of  correlations  in  at  least  dipole  GOS  is  big  enough  even  at  high  transferred 
energies. We also did not mention the fact that GOS determine not only electron ionization but 
also photon emission in the fast electron-atom scattering that is called atomic bremsstrahlung. 

Of great interest are such relatively new objects of GOS studies as clusters and fullerenes 

themselves. 

To summarize, let me say that it is a lot to do in this old and still young domain of research.

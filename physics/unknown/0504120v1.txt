Abstract

Kinetics  of  radiation  damage  of  the  PWO  crystals  under  irradiation  and  recovery  were
studied.  Crystals  were  irradiated  with  dose  corresponding  to  average  one  expected  in  the
electromagnetic  calorimeter  (working  dose  irradiation).  Radiation  damage  and  recovery  were
monitored through measurements of PWO optical  transmission. An approach is proposed which
allows evaluating the influence of the PWO crystals properties on the statistical term in the energy
resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter. The analysis also gives important information about
the nature of the radiation damage mechanism in scintillation crystals. The method was used during
development  of  technology  of  the  mass  production  of  radiation  hard  crystals  and  during
development of methods for crystals certification.

Introduction

The CMS (Compact Moon Solenoid) experimental setup is under construction now at the
LHC accelerator facility in the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN, Switzerland) [1].
The  Electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL)  is  one  of  the  major  elements  of  the  setup.  The  ECAL
contains a multiplicity of total absorption detectors based on PWO scintillation crystals, optically
linked with avalanche photodiode (APD) used as photo detector. The gamma radiation, entering the
detector,  initiates  an  electromagnetic  shower  in  the  crystal.  Electrons  and  positrons  loose  their
energy by ionization in the bulk of the crystal which causes an emission of scintillation light. The
scintillation  photons  collected  on  the  photodetector  generate  an  electric  signal  registered  by  the
read-out electronics. It is designed to detect Higgs bosons in a range of masses of 90 GeV ≤ mH
≤150 GeV through the H→γγ decay channel. Because this Higgs bosons decay is a relatively rare
event, long time measurements during several working cycles of the accelerator are required. A year
cycle of the LHC accelerator includes three 60 days operation periods with full radiation charge and
14 days intervals in between, when there is no radiation. After these three cycles there is a complete
stop of accelerator for about 150 days. High level irradiation appears in the ECAL barrel during
LHC operation. Depending on the angle distribution of the shower, the maximum dose rate may be
as high as 0.25 Gy/h.

The quantity of registered photons depends on the light collection efficiency, which, in turn,
depends on the crystal transparency. As was shown in [2, 3] radiation-induced optical absorption in
PWO crystals in wide region of radiation doses is not caused by damage of radiation centers but
mainly is the result of color centers formation at the point structure defects. Formation of color
centers induces a decrease in the PWO optical transparency which in turn causes a worsening of the
ECAL energy resolution [4]. This is the reason of the importance of the study of radiation damage
and recovery processes of PWO scintillation crystals.

This  paper  presents  results  of  research  on  the  PWO  optical  transmission  kinetics  under
irradiation which were carried out at the General Irradiation Facility (GIF) at CERN (Cs137 γ-source,
Eγ~0.66 MeV). Dose and dose rate correspond to the average values expected in the ECAL during
operation periods (dose rate 0.15 Gy/h, absorption dose 6 Gy). The experimental setup provided a
continuous  monitoring  of  the  PWO  optical  transmission.  Results  of  the  crystals  transmission
measurements were compared with the results of PWO light yield measurements performed with
high  energy  electrons  beam  (100  GeV).  A  detailed  analysis  was  performed  from  data  of  three
crystals.

Analysis of kinetics of the PWO optical transmission damage and recovery

Fig.  1  presents  spectra  of  luminescence  and  radiation  induced  absorption  coefficient  of
optical  transmission  of  typical  PWO  crystal.  We  studied  relaxation  kinetics  of  the  induced
absorption  at  the  420  nm  wavelength  of  doped  and  non-doped  crystals,  because  luminescence
maximum is positioned in this region [3].

Radiation induced absorption is determined through the following equation:

Fig. 1: Spectra of luminescence and radiation induced coefficient of optical

transmission of typical PWO crystal.

As the analysis shows, at working dose irradiation, an evolution of the optical transmission

at the 420 nm wavelength of all samples is well fitted by the following equation (see Fig. 2):

δT(t) = 1 – Σiαi·exp (– t/τi)

(2),

with αI  – contribution to the δT during irradiation period and τI  – time constant of the particular
color center formation.

The  exponential  approximation  corresponds  to  the  defects  decaying  through  thermo
activation only. The contribution of a large amount of components can be well approximated under
the above conditions of irradiation: time discreteness, accuracy of δT measurements and relative
contribution  of  αi  by  two  exponentials  with  time  constants  103  s  and  105  –  106  s.  The  fast
component resulted from the thermo activation of the (WO3–WO3)2– centers. However, the slow
component cannot be linked to the thermo induced recombination. It is known that electron and
hole centres formed on PWO point structure defects have thermo activation energies in the region
from 0.03 to 0.7 eV and the longest activation time of these centers is about 103 s. That is why,
beyond  thermo-activation  of  centers  and  the  following  recombination  of  formed  carriers,  other
recombination  processes,  such  as,  those  caused  by  electrons  tunneling,  should  exist  [5,6].  This
tunneling effect means that electron due to its quantum mechanical nature can be localized with
some probability at rather long distance from electronic center. There is some probability that an
electron  will  appear  in  the  vicinity  of  a  hole  center  located  rather  distant  (~  100  Å)  from  the
electronic center and that it recombines with this hole center.

That  is  why  we  consider  a  recovery  of  optical  transmission  as  a  combination  of  two
processes: decay of color centers through thermo activation for the fast component and diffusion-
tunnel recombination for slow component. The recovery curve taking into consideration a diffusion
–tunnel recombination mechanism should follow the following equation [7]:

The results of experimental data fits according to  equations (2,3) are presented in Fig. 2 and
in Tables 1, 2. As one can see the experimentally observed recombination of optical transmission is
well approximated by a linear combination of the same number of exponents than was used for the
damage  fit.  Fractional  contributions  of  components  at  damage  and  recovery  are  approximately
corresponding  to  each  other.  That  is  why  for  further  calculations  we  used  a  more  simple  two
exponents approximation instead of more complex calculations according to equation (3).

The  chosen  simplified  model  allowed  to  carry  out  evaluations  of  crystals  optical
transmission  change  during  LHC  accelerator  working  cycle,  which  includes  active  phase
(transmission of defects to the color centers, i.e. radiation damage) lasting td accepted as 6 hours,
and  recharge  phase  (color  centers  decay,  i.e.  recovery  of  crystal  optical  transmission)  lasting tr
accepted as 2 hours. We also accepted that dose rate during tests corresponds to the average dose
rate during the active phase [1].

According to [9], under the exponential approximation and in stationary regime, in which
optical transmission change during active phase and recharge phase are equal in absolute value we
can write the following equation for relative change of defects number during td and relative change
of color centers number during tr:

where λd is the speed of the defect transformation to the color center (damage), which we consider
to be constant and proportional to the dose rate, and Nd(t) is the defect number at time t after the
start of the irradiation;

where λr is the speed of color center transformation to the defect (recovery), which we consider to

The  following  equation  gives  the  correspondence  between  the  number  of  defects  and  of

color centers:

Nd + Nr = N0

where N0 – number of defects before start of irradiation.

Differential equation of kinetics of defects number:

dNd/dt = – _dNd + _r(N0 – Nd)

General solution of kinetic equation (7) for the defects number (8) and color centers (9):

(8),

Nd = (N0 /(_d + _r)) (_r + __ exp (– (_d + _r)t))
Nr = (N0 /(_d + _r)) (_d – __ exp (– (_d + _r)t))

where __ is a constant which depends on the boundary conditions.
Time constant of coming to stationary regime is:

_ = 1/(_d + _r)

dNd/dt = _r(N0 – Nd)

Defects recovery after stop of irradiation is described by the following differential equation:

Then, there is a general solution for the kinetics equation (11) for number of defects (12)

and number of color centers (13):

Nd = N0 (1 – __ exp (– _rt))
Nr = N0 __ exp (– _rt)

where __ is a constant which depends on boundary conditions.

Experimental  data  were  fitted  with  exponential  functions  according  to  equations  (8),  (9)

(during irradiation) and equations (12), (13) (after irradiations).

Under stationary regime of PWO transmission change at LHC operation a number of color
centers  formed  during  time  td  is  –ΔNd(td)  and  corresponds  to  the  quantity  of  defects  ΔNr(tr)
recovered during the recharge time tr:

–ΔNd(td) = ΔNr(tr)
Let’s introduce variables:

fr = exp (– λrtr)
fd = exp (– (λd + λr)td))

(16),

(17).

(18).

(19),

From (8), (9) and (12), (13) with condition (14), a following equation can be written for
relative  quantity  of  defects  at  the  beginning  and  after  completing  of  recovery  cycle  αr  and  α d
correspondingly.

For αr

For αd

αr = (1 – fr (fd – (λd/(λd + λr)) (fd – 1)))/(1 – fr fd)

αd = (1 – fr fd + (λd/(λd + λr))( fd – 1))/(1 – fr fd)

Then, following equation can be written for a relative change of transmission at stationary

regime at the beginning and after completing of recovery cycle δTr and δTd correspondingly:

δTr = 1 – αr = ((λd/(λd + λr)) fr (1 – fd))/(1 – fr fd)

δTd = 1 – αd = (λd/(λd + λr)) ((1 – fd))/(1 – fr fd)

During  irradiation  cycle  a  relative  change  of  transmission  δT_,  taking  into  consideration

δT_ = δTd – δTr = ((λd/(λd + λr))(1 – fr)(1 – fd))/(1 – fr fd)

(21).

A characteristic time of coming to the stationary regime according the criteria of two time

(19), (20), is following:

constant is:

τ = 2/(λd + λr)

A  correspondence  between  time  constants  at  irradiation  and  at  recovery, τd  and τr,  and
corresponding  speeds  of  formation  and  decay  of  color  centers  are  determined  by  the  following
equations:

and

and

λr = 1/τr

λd = 1/τd – 1/τr

The  results  of  experimental  data  analysis  of  damage  and  recovery  time  constants τd, τr,,
amplitudes Ad, Ar and contributions to the optical transmission change and results of calculations of
λr, λd, δTr, δTd are listed in Table 2. Choice of correspondence of the τd  and τr of the same i–th
group  of  centers  (i  =  1,  2)  was  made  taking  into  account  that  the  time  constant  at  irradiation  is
always smaller than the one at recovery and that the contributions of the same group of centers to
the  optical  transmission  change  δT  must  correspond  to  each  other  within  the  accuracy  of  the
approximation.

As one can see from the obtained data (see table. 2 and Fig.   3), in stationary regime after
recharge, a relative change of defects quantity for all components is from 50 to 100 % and after
simulation of the active cycle a quantity of color centers becomes close to saturation for the dose
rate and irradiation schedule (td = 6 hours and tr = 2 hours) used.

From experimental data we can observe a presence in damage and recovery of components
with time constant of several hundreds seconds. Relative contribution of these components into δT
is about 10–15 %. Because experimental data were obtained with a measurements sampling period
of 240 s, it is impossible to define precisely the “fast” components parameters without an increase
of the dose rate and of the measurements frequency.

squares – relative change of transmission at the end of the recovery cycle (δTd).

Taking into account the obtained data, the time necessary to reach the stationary regime is

about 3 working cycles of LHC, i.e. about 24 hours.

From  Table  2  one  can  see  that  the  maximal  time  of  PWO  recovery  after  irradiation  is
5.5×106 s or 64 days. It means that a period of complete stop of accelerator is sufficient for the
complete  recovery  of  crystals.  At  the  same  time,  one  can  see  that  during  14–days  period  of
accelerator   stop, a part of the crystals will not completely recover. As one can see during the 14
days period one can expect a recovery till the level of 80 % from original value.

To extend the results of the optical transmission kinetic measurements on the technological
lot  of  PWO,  a  test  of  PWO  sampling  consisting  of  about  1000  crystals  with  various  dose  rates
corresponding to different zones of the ECAL have to be carried out.

Conclusion

Kinetics  of  radiation  damage  of  the  PWO  crystals  under  irradiation  and  recovery  were
studied. An approach to evaluate an influence of individual PWO characteristics in strong radiation
fields on the photostatistic term in ECAL energy resolution is proposed.

7

Kinetics  of  radiation  damage  and  recovery  of  several  PWO  crystals  is  analyzed.  The
analysis results show the presence of slow components which cannot have thermo activation origin.
To  explain  a  presence  of  these  components  a  diffusion  tunnel  process  of  deep  traps  decay  is
proposed.

The collected data shows that a more detailed analysis of crystals behavior under irradiation
requires  the  continuation  of  the  regular  research  on  the  PWO  radiation  damage  and  recovery
kinetics.

The proposed approach was used during development of the mass production technology of

radiation hard crystals and during development of methods for crystals certification.

Abstract

HLS  (Hefei  Light  Source)  is  a  second  generation
synchrotron  radiation  source.  After  injected  into  the
storage  ring  at  energy  of  200MeV,  the  electrons  will  be
ramped to 800MeV. During ramping, the magnetic fields
of the bend, quadruple and sextuple magnets are ramped
up synchronously to keep the working point of the storage
ring  unchanged.  This  process  is  carefully  controlled  by
HLS control system, which is built under EPICS. Several
measures  are  taken  to  insure  the  synchronization  and
linearity of the ramping.

1 INTRODUCTION
HLS  (Hefei  Light  Source)  is  a  dedicated  synchrotron
light source. It consists of three parts, linac, transport line
and storage ring [1]. After been accelerated to 200Mev by
the linac, Electrons go through the transport line and then
be  injected  into  the  storage  ring.  Because  the  working
energy  of  HLS  is  800Mev,  the  electrons  need  to  be
accelerated  again  to  800Mev,  which  called  ramping.
During  ramping,  the  fields  of  all  main  magnets  which
includes  bend,  quadruple  and  sextupole  magnets  ramped
up synchronously to keep the working point, i.e. bending
radius, tune and chromaticity unchanged.  This process is
carefully controlled by HLS control system, which is built
under  EPICS  [2].  The  control  of  ramping  includes  three
steps,

 is determined by the energy and
BBEND.  The  tune  is  mainly  determined  by  K,  and
chromaticity  is  mainly  determined  by  l .  So  the  working
point of the storage ring will not change if all of the bend,
quadruple  and  sextupole  magnets  ramped  up  with  the
speed calculated with equation (1).

3 SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Fig. 1 shows the control system of main magnets power
supplies.  Before  ramping  started,  the  ramping  tables  are
calculated on the  work station and then transferred to PS
controller  via  the  IOC.  The  ramping  procedure 
is
controlled  by  some  records  in  the  IOC.  There  is  a
interface to allow operators to control these records.

6  CONCLUSION
This  software  has  been  running  for  about  one  year.
According  the  experiences  in  the  operation  of  HLS,  the
control of ramping is proven to be reliable.

4 RAMPING CALCULATION
Suppose  the  starting  and  end  energy  of  ramping  is  EB
and EE.  From  equation  (1),  we  get  the  corresponding  BB
and BE.  From  the  magnetic  field  measurements,  we  have
the B-I relation. So we get the corresponding PS currents,
IB and IE. Suppose the time used during ramping is D
t, the
speed of ramping is,
I

The  PS  controller  control  the  PS  setpoint  by  DAC,
corresponding  to  the  PS  currents,  the  DAC  value  is  DB

Because  the  time  is  controlled  by  a  counter,  whose
value  together  with  the  DAC  value  are  all  integers,  the
result  of  equation  (3)  must  have  an  unwanted  error.  To
minimize this error, let’s suppose,

5  RAMPING CONTROL

Fig.  2  is  the  control  panel  of  HLS  ramping.  When
ramping  is  needed,  it  read  the  current  setpoints  of  all  of
the  main  magnet  power  supplies.  With  a  predefined
configuration file, the program calculates ramping tables
for  these  main  magnet  power  supplies,  and  then  sends
them to corresponding PS controllers via the IOC.  After
the ramping table downloading is completed, the program
sends  a  ramping  preparation  command  to  all  of  the  PS
controllers.  As  soon  as  get  the  ramping  preparation
command, the PS controller begins to prepare for ramping,
table,  spawning
which 
ramping task and waiting for step semaphore. After all of
these  work  completed,  the  master  counter  begin  to  send
signals  to  all  of  the  slave  counters.  The  slave  counter
counts these signals. When the count number reaches the
corresponding  number  defined  in  the  ramping  table,  the
counter invoked an interrupt. There is an interrupt service
routine  for  this  interrupt,  which  will  send  a  step
semaphore to the ramping task. As soon as take the step

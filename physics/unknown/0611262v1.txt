Modeling the “rapid” part of the velocity – pressure-gradient correlation 

in inhomogeneous turbulent flows

A  new  model  for  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  velocity  –  pressure-gradient  correlation  in  the  Reynolds 

averaged  Navier-Stokes  equations  is  suggested.  It  is  shown  that  in  an  inhomogeneous 

incompressible turbulent flow, the model that is linear in the Reynolds stresses should include two 

model  coefficients.  A  functional  form  of  the  coefficients  is  analyzed  in  some  extreme  turbulence 

states. As demonstrated, the proposed model reduces to the standard linear pressure-strain model in 

homogeneous  turbulence  and  can  satisfy  realizability  conditions  provided  the  coefficients  are 

functions of the mean velocity gradients and the Reynolds stresses. In an inhomogeneous turbulent 

flow,  coefficients  should  depend  on  parameters  directly  related  to  inhomogeneous  effects.  The 

model is validated using direct numerical simulation data from two flows: the plane wake and the 

plane mixing layer.

1. Introduction 

The  exact  transport  equation  for  the  Reynolds stresses  provides  more  detailed  information 

on turbulence structure than the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy combined with 

the  Boussinesq  turbulent-viscosity  hypothesis  for  the  Reynolds  stresses.  However,  the  exact 

Reynolds stress transport (RST) equation

. Clearly, the ability of a 

turbulence model based on the exact RST equation to describe flow physics depends on the quality 

of model expressions incorporated in the RST equation to represent unknown terms. The focus of 

the current study is on modeling the velocity – pressure-gradient tensor 

ijΠ .  

Following  Rotta  (1951),  it  is  a  common  practice  to  split  the  correlation 

u p<
i

, j

>

into  two 

parts:  the  pressure-strain  correlation 

<

i , ju p

>   and  the  pressure-diffusion  part 

u p<
i

> j

,

.  This 

approach has advantages if one simulates homogeneous turbulence with a two-equation turbulence 

model.  In  homogeneous  turbulence,  both  the  pressure-diffusion  term 

iu p<

,i

>   and  the  pressure-

strain  term 

<

i ,iu p

>

  do  not  contribute  to  the  transport  of  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy.  In 

inhomogeneous  turbulent  flows,  however,  the  modeling  of  the  pressure-diffusion  term  in  the 

transport  equation  for  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  is  challenging.  Direct  numerical  simulation 

(DNS) data from free shear flows (Rogers & Moser 1994, Moser, Rogers & Ewing 1998) show that 

the contribution of the pressure diffusion to the turbulent kinetic energy balance is not negligible, 

especially  in  the  central  core  of  these  flows.  These  data  also  show  that  modeling  the  pressure 

diffusion  and  turbulent  diffusion  terms  together  is  not  likely  to  be  successful  because  they    have

qualitatively different profiles (see Fig. 21 in Rogers & Moser 1994 and Fig. 12 in Moser, Rogers & 

Ewing  1998).  In  fact,  a  model  for  turbulent  diffusion  can  absorb  only  a  part  of  the  pressure-

diffusion term 

iu p<

>

,i

, the so-called “slow” part:

(Lumley 1978). The rest of the pressure-diffusion term still requires modeling.  

The  above  discussion  demonstrates  that  the  splitting  of  the  velocity  –  pressure-gradient 

correlation 

u p<
i

, j

>

,  which  is  originally  present  in  equation 

(1.1),  into  the  pressure-strain  and 

pressure-diffusion parts is not so beneficial in inhomogeneous turbulent flows as in homogeneous 

turbulence, even in application to the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy. In regard 

to equation (1.1), both terms 

u p<
i

>

,

j

 and 

<

i , ju p

>  should be modeled based on DNS data. Thus, 

two  models  for  the  pressure-related  correlations  are  necessary  if  the  splitting  of 

u p<
i

, j

>

  is 

imposed. This is clearly a disadvantage. Therefore, in inhomogeneous turbulent flows, modeling the 

correlation 

u p<
i

, j

 is more natural.

should be evaluated at a point  Y'  with coordinates

is the distance from  Y'  to the point Y with coordinates

∂ ∂  denotes the normal derivative. The velocity – pressure-gradient

correlation on the left side of (1.3) is evaluated at point Y, whereas all derivatives on the right side 

are taken at  Y' . The objective of the current paper is to develop a model for the first term on the 

right  side  of  expression  (1.3),  which  is  called  the  “rapid”  part  of  the  velocity  –  pressure-gradient 

correlation

                         (2.1) 

holds  exactly  in  an  incompressible  flow.  In  a  compressible  flow,  it  holds  approximately.  The 

integrand  in  (2.1)  is  non-zero  only  over  the  volume  where  the  two-point  correlation 

n iu u′<

  (or 

more precisely

which  lie  within  the  length  scale  of  the  two-point  correlation  measured  from  Y  contribute  to  the 

integral  in 

(2.1).  If  one  assumes  that  the  function 

  varies  more  slowly  than  the  two-point 

m,nU'

correlation within the volume determined by the length scale of the two-point correlation, then, to a 

first approximation, we can rewrite expression 

(2.1) as

                               (2.2) 

(Chou 1945). This is the so-called “weak inhomogeneity” approximation wherein the mean velocity 

gradient  is  assumed  “almost  constant”  over  an  integral  length  scale  and  all  functions  are  still 

regarded as functions of the space coordinates. (Of course, (2.1) and (2.2) are equivalent in the case 

of homogeneity.) Using  (2.2), Chou (1945) suggested modeling the “rapid” part of the velocity – 

pressure-gradient tensor as

Thus, no condition on symmetry under permutation of the indices i and j is imposed on the tensor 

function 

nmjia

. The idea of modeling the pressure-related correlations separately was applied for the 

first time to the pressure-strain correlations

It is important to emphasize the main difference in modeling the velocity – pressure-gradient 

correlation

. Although in both cases, we 

arrive to expression (2.4) as a model representation of

As  one  can  notice,  the  spatial  derivatives  in  two  expressions  are  taken  at  different  locations.  It 

results in different properties of expressions (2.5) and (2.6).

assuming that the length scale of the two-point correlation is less than the distance from the flow 

points  under  consideration  to  any  flow  boundary,  and  therefore,  the  surface  integral  can  be 

neglected  in  (2.8).  Notice  again  that  this  is  not  an  assumption  of  homogeneity.  The  flow  can  be 

strongly inhomogeneous far from the boundaries.

Rodi  1975,  Speziale,  Sarkar  &  Gatski  1991,  and  Ristorcelli,  Lumley  &  Abid  1995),  Green’s 

theorem  cannot  be  directly  used  in  the  analyses  of  expression  (2.6)  for  the  pressure-strain 

correlation,  unless  symmetry  under  permutation  of  the  indices  n  and  i  is  also  assumed.  This 

assumption is, in fact, the assumption of turbulence homogeneity (see Chou 1945, Rotta 1951) and 

therefore, restricts the application of models using this constrain by homogeneous turbulent flows. 

Contrary,  application  of  Green’s  theorem  to  the  analysis  of  expression  (2.5)  does  not  require  the 

assumption of symmetry under permutation of the indices n and i. As a result, the application area 

of model expression (2.10) is extended to inhomogeneous turbulent flows. There is an interesting 

and useful consequence of that, which will be brought out in relation to expressions (2.10) and (3.1) 

Notice  also  that  symmetry  under  permutation  of  the  indices  n  and  i  was  imposed  on  a 

nonlinear model for the velocity – pressure-gradient correlation suggested in Ristorcelli, Lumley & 

Abid  (1995).  As  a  result,  the  model  suggested  there  was  derived  under  the  assumption  of 

homogeneity and, therefore, is a nonlinear model for the pressure-strain correlation.

We emphasize that the connection between the coefficients

(3.1) holds only in a homogeneous turbulence, not in general. This yields the LRR model with only 

a single degree of freedom. But, the coefficients, e.g., C 1 = 2/5 and C  = -5/6 that provide good fits

Two-component  axisymmetric  homogeneous  turbulence.  Expression  (3.6)  reduces  to 

C =

2 5

 in the case of two-component axisymmetric homogeneous turbulence. The corresponding 

value of 

2C

 in such a flow is 

4 5−

. These values satisfy (3.5). 

These examples demonstrate that the coefficients 

1C

 and 

2C

 vary from flow to flow. Except 

 

9

 

 

 

 

 

some  simple  cases  where  they  can  take  constant  values  (e.g.,  the  two-component  axisymmetric 

homogeneous  turbulence  considered  here), 

1C

 and 

2C

 are functions of at least the mean velocity 

gradients  and  the  Reynolds  stresses,  even  in  homogeneous  turbulence.  There  are  no  universal 

constant values for these coefficients. It is true in particular for expression 

(3.2): this expression can 

be used to describe the two-component homogeneous turbulence only if the coefficient 

1C

 is given 

by 

(3.6), and thus, both homogeneity (3.1) and two-componentiality (3.4) conditions are satisfied. 

Even  though 

1C

  can  take  a  constant  value  in  any  given  flow,  this  value  varies  depending  on  the 

flow characteristics.  

The  conclusion  that  the  coefficients 

1C

  and 

2C

  are  functions  rather  than  constants  is  in 

agreement with the previous discussion in, e.g., Lumley (1978), Ristorcelli, Lumley & Abid (1995), 

Reynolds (1987), and Girimaji (2000) who assume that the model coefficients in the pressure-strain 

correlation models are functions of the mean velocity gradients, Reynolds stresses, and dissipation.

An  important  question  in  modeling

u p<

  (see 

expression 

(2.1)), there is no indication that the model for this term should be of the diffusive type. 

What  “diffusive  type”  requires  is  that  the  integral  of  the  sum  of  three  correlations 

u p<

i

(

 vanishes throughout the flow. This requirement does not also imply that each of the 

terms  in  expression 

(1.3)  would  vanish  separately.  In  the  current  paper,  only  one  of  the  terms  in 

(1.3) is modeled. Finally, even assuming that the integral of (4.1) taken over the entire flow volume 

should vanish, one can argue that this result can be achieved with different functional forms of the 

coefficient 

kC

,  not  necessarily  of  the  diffusive  type.  This question clearly requires more study in 

the future. Notice, however, that expressions 

(2.9), (2.10), and (4.1) hold regardless of the models 

for the coefficients

1C

, 

2C

,  and  

kC

, and these expressions are the focus of the current paper. 

5. Verification against DNS data 

Even  though  general  mathematical  expressions  for  the  coefficients 

1C

,

2C

,  and 

kC

  are 

currently  unavailable,  information  on  their  functional  form  can  be  partly  drawn  from  DNS  and 

experimental data. In the present paper, the DNS results for the unforced simulations of the time-

developing plane turbulent wake presented in Moser, Rogers & Ewing (1998) are used. The flow 

was  allowed  to  evolve  long  enough  to  attain  self-similarity.  Therefore,  the  cross-stream  direction 

2x  is the only direction of flow inhomogeneity and of all mean velocity derivatives, only 

,U ≠  
0

( 1x   is  the  streamwise  direction).  The  self-similar  cross-stream  coordinate  is  defined  to  be 

ξ

2 /
x
δ=

( )
t

,  where  the  half-width  δ  is  the  distance  between  the 

2x -location  at  which  the  mean 

velocity is half of the maximum magnitude of the velocity deficit. 

For

, 

( r )Π
33

( r )Π

,  the  terms  on  the  right-hand  side  of  expression 

(2.10)  can  be 

evaluated using the DNS data for the Reynolds stresses and

 (DNS profiles are denoted by dashed lines, and the profiles calculated from 

expression 

(2.10) are denoted by solid lines). Interestingly enough, it was found that by assigning to 

the  coefficients 

1C

  and 

2C

  the  values  2/5  and  -5/6,  respectively,  one  can  obtain  the  profiles  for 

( r )Π
11

( r )Π
33

, and 

( r )Π
12

, which are in good agreement with the DNS data. These values of 

1C

 and 

2C

 

 

11

(which obviously do not satisfy the homogeneity constraint (3.1)) may be considered as a validation 

of the weak inhomogeneity assumption. 

The value of the coefficient 

0 5.=

) is obtained from (4.2). In the wake, DNS data are 

 (kC

not available separately for the “rapid” and “slow” parts of the pressure diffusion in the transport 

equation for the turbulent kinetic energy. Therefore, only the sum of expressions (1.2) and (4.1) can 

be compared with the DNS data. To compute the sum of expressions (1.2)  and (4.1), the DNS data 

for the production and turbulent diffusion terms in the transport equation for the turbulent kinetic 

energy are used. The result (solid line) is compared with the DNS profile for the pressure diffusion 

(dotted line) in Fig. 2(a). In addition, the production (dashed line) and the turbulent diffusion (dash-

dotted line) are also shown in the figure.  

In the self-similar plane turbulent mixing layer, the coefficient 

 can also be approximated 

kC

by a constant value. The DNS data for this flow are presented in Rogers & Moser (1994). Matching 

the  maximum  of  the  DNS  profile  for  the  pressure  diffusion  with  the  maximum  of  the  sum  of 

expressions 

(1.2) and (4.1) calculated with the DNS data for the production and turbulent diffusion 

terms yields 

kC

.=

0 52

. The DNS profiles for the pressure diffusion is compared with the calculated 

sum of expressions 

(1.2) and (4.1) in Fig. 2(b). Notations are the same as in Fig. 2(a). 

 

As  Figures  2(a)  and  2(b)  demonstrate,  the  sum  of  expressions  (1.2)  and  (4.1)  closely 

approximates the DNS profile for the pressure diffusion in both flows. The value of the coefficient 

kC

, which is found to be 0.5 in the wake and 0.52 in the mixing layer, deviates from 0.6, which is 

the value of 

kC

 in homogeneous turbulence (see discussion in relation to expression 

(4.2)). 

6. Summary 

In the current paper, a new model expression for the “rapid” part of the velocity – pressure-

gradient  correlations  in  inhomogeneous  turbulence  is  presented.  Expression  (2.10)  contains  two 

model coefficients. Generally, they are unknown functions of several parameters including, among 

other  quantities,  the  mean  velocity  gradients  and  the  Reynolds  stresses.  It  appears  that  these 

coefficients can take constant values or be well approximated by a constant value in some flows. 

DNS data of Rogers & Moser (1994) and Moser, Rogers & Ewing (1998) are used to determine a 

value  of  these  coefficients  in  the  self-similar  plane  wake  and  the  self-similar  plane  mixing  layer. 

However, even in flows with simple geometries, such as the wake and the mixing layer considered 

here, the turbulence structure is complicated. As discussed in Rogers & Moser (1994) and Moser, 

Rogers  &  Ewing  (1998),  both  experiments  and  DNS  show  that  in  geometrically-equivalent  flow 

situations at the same Reynolds number, multiple asymptotic states can be observed. The difference 
 
12

between  alternative  states  manifests  itself  in  statistics  and  the  flow  structure.  Whereas  the  mean 

velocity and shear stress profiles are universal (or nearly universal) under appropriate scaling, the 

normal stresses and turbulent kinetic energy profiles are non-unique. A model with constant-value 

coefficients cannot describe this phenomenon. DNS confirms that statistical differences reflect the 

differences  in  the  large-scale  structure  of  turbulence,  which  depends  strongly  on  the  Reynolds 

number, “uncontrolled and possibly unknown properties of the initial or inlet conditions” (Moser, 

Rogers & Ewing 1998), flow geometry, boundary conditions, external forces etc. (Tsinober 1998). 

Further study (including DNS) is necessary to determine how the large-scale structure of turbulence 

is reflected in the model coefficients and how they can be described mathematically in the general 

case.

Abstract:
The Marshall and Sanow data set is the largest and most comprehensive data set available quantifying handgun bullet effectiveness 
in humans.  This article presents an empirical model for relative incapacitation probability in humans hit in the thoracic cavity by 
handgun bullets.  The model is constructed by employing the hypothesis that the wound channel and ballistic pressure wave effects 
each have an associated independent probability of incapacitation.  Combining models for these two independent probabilities using 
the elementary rules of probability and performing a least-squares fit to the Marshall and Sanow data provides an empirical model 
with only two adjustable parameters for modeling bullet effectiveness with a standard error of 5.6% and a correlation coefficient R 
=  0.939.    This  supports  the  hypothesis  that  wound  channel  and  pressure  wave  effects  are  independent  (within  the  experimental 
error), and it also allows assignment of the relative contribution of each effect for a given handgun load.  This model also gives the 
expected limiting behavior  in the cases of very small and  very large  variables (wound channel and  pressure  wave),  as well as for 
incapacitation by rifle and shotgun projectiles.

Introduction:  Formulating  the  Pressure  Wave 

I.
Hypothesis
Selecting  service  caliber  handgun  loads  with  the  greatest 
potential  for  rapid  incapacitation of  violent  criminal  or  terrorist 
attackers is of great interest in the law enforcement community.  
It  is  generally  agreed  upon  that  bullet  design  plays  at  least  as 
important  a  role  in  bullet  effectiveness  as  the  cartridge  from 
which it is fired.  However, it is still widely debated whether the 
only contributing factors to the effectiveness of different designs 
are the volume of crushed tissue and penetration depth [FAC96a, 
PAT89].  

Crushed  tissue  volume  and  penetration  contribute  to  bullet 
effectiveness  through  the  physiological  consequences  of  blood 
loss.  Over  the  years,  other  mechanisms  such  as  hydrostatic 
shock,  energy  dump,  hydraulic  reaction,  and  the  temporary 
stretch  cavity  have  been  suggested  [PAT89].    Authors  who 
suggest these mechanisms usually have something in mind more 
or less related to a ballistic pressure wave.  However, other than 
temporary  cavitation,  these  suggested  mechanisms  have  largely 
eluded clear definitions and unambiguous evidence.  

The view that the crushed tissue volume (the permanent cavity) 
[FAC96a]  is  the  only  reliable  contributor  to  incapacitation  (for 
handgun bullet placements which do not hit the central  nervous 
system  or  supporting  bone  structure)  relies  on  the  unproven 

premise  that  easily  detectable  wounding1  is  necessary  for  an 
effect to contribute to incapacitation.  

Even though  it has  been  shown  that  most handgun  bullets  do 
not  produce  a  temporary  stretch  cavity  (the  volume  of  tissue 
temporarily pushed  out  of  the  way  by  a  passing  bullet)  large 
enough to stretch  most vital tissue beyond  the elastic limit,  it 
remains an unproven premise that exceeding the elastic limit is 
incapacitation  with 
necessary 
parameters determined from ballistic gelatin.

increased 

Handgun  bullet  effectiveness  should  be  studied  without 
depending  on  the  premise  that  the  only  contributors  to 
incapacitation  result  in  wounding  that  is  easily  observable  to 
the trauma surgeon or medical examiner.  One way to do this 
is  to  separate  the  issue  of  incapacitation  from  wounding  by 
directly considering incapacitation and attempting to correlate 
observed  metrics  of  incapacitation  with  potential  causal 
agents.    This  was  the  approach  of  Marshall  and  Sanow  in 
compiling their data [MAS92, MAS96, MAS01].  In contrast, 
work  considering  wounding  or  wound  trauma  as  a  valid 
incapacitation  metric  depends  strongly  on  the  unproven 
presupposition 
that  only  easily  detectable  wounding 
contributes to rapid incapacitation.

                                                
1 By this we mean wounding that would typically be detected by a 
trauma surgeon or medical examiner.

For handgun loads that produce relatively large pressure  waves, 
there  is  no  published  data  showing  that  observed  measures  of 
rapid  incapacitation  are  correlated  only  with  the  volume  of 
crushed  tissue  or  observed  wounding.    The  conclusion  that 
incapacitation  is  only  caused  by  volume  of  crushed  tissue  or 
observed  wounding is not founded upon repeatable experiments 
or  carefully  compiled  data,  but  relies  on  expert  opinion2
[FAC87a, FAC96a, PAT89, MAC94] and exaggerated efforts to 
discredit data suggesting other causal agents [FAC91a, COC06a 
and references therein].

One step in the formation of the pressure wave hypothesis is the 
fact  that  most  wound  ballistics  experts  agree  that  a  strongly 
energy-dependent  factor  such  as  the  temporary  stretch  cavity 
plays a vital role in incapacitation via rifle bullets [FAC99a].  It 
is  not  obvious  that  this  energy  dependence  disappears  as  the 
energy-dependent  parameter  is  lowered  from  rifle  levels  to 
handgun  levels.    The  most  powerful  service  caliber  handgun 
loads  only  have  20-30%  less  impact  energy  than  the  .223 
Remington.3    In  addition,  since  pressure  wave  magnitude 
depends on the local rate of energy transfer, some service caliber 
handgun  loads  have  peak  pressure  wave  magnitudes  that  are 
larger than some of the more deeply penetrating rifle loads.  

A second step in the formation of the pressure  wave hypothesis 
is  our  repeated  observations  from  sport  hunting  that  one  only 
needs a  handgun bullet  which expands to  0.6”  or  0.7” diameter 
to incapacitate a deer as quickly (with a shot to the center of the 
chest)  as  an  archery  broadhead  of  1-3/8”  to  1-1/2”  cutting 
diameter.    If  the  only  important  parameter  was  the  amount  of 
major blood vessels severed to create blood loss, then it stands to 
reason  that  a  bullet  would  have  to  expand  to  a  diameter 
comparable to that of the broadhead to have a comparable effect.  

Yet  with full broadside penetration near the center of the chest, 
hunting handgun bullets that reliably expand to only 0.6” or 0.7” 
in  the  typical  deer  hunting  cartridges  will  reliably  incapacitate 
deer at least as quickly (on average) as a hunting broadhead of 1-
3/8”  to  1-1/2”  cutting diameter.    If  handgun  bullets  produce  an 
effect  in  deer  that  provides  more  rapid  incapacitation  than 

                                                
2  We  agree  with  these  authors  on  many  points,  especially  their 
correlations  of  bullet  parameters  and  gelatin  measurements  with 
observed  wounding.    Our  scientific  disagreement  with  their  work  is 
whether  easily  observed  wounding  alone  is  well  correlated  with  rapid
incapacitation. To the extent that they don't claim that it is, we are not 
saying that they are wrong as much as their work is incomplete. (Their 
claim  is  that  wounding  is  well  correlated  with  reliable  eventual
incapacitation.  Our concern is rapid incapacitation.) We disagree only 
with an untested hypothesis for which they offer no data.  
3 The most energetic 10mm loads provide over 750 ft-lbs of energy.  In 
an M4, the SS109 round provides 1026 ft-lbs at 50 yards and only 686 
ft-lbs at 200 yards.  Consequently, studying how incapacitation depends 
on  pressure  wave  magnitude  (related  to  energy)  is  also  relevant  for 
understanding  decreasing  .223  effectiveness  as  range  is  increased  or 
barrel length is shortened.

bleeding effects alone, then it stands to reason that this effect 
may be present in similarly-sized mammals such as humans.

A third step in the formation of the pressure  wave hypothesis 
is  the  idea  that  blood  pressure  drop  due  to  internal  bleeding 
takes about 5 seconds to have its effect in a best case scenario.  
Newgard describes this idea well [NEW92]:

For  an  average  70  kg  (155  lb.) male  the  cardiac  output  will  be 5.5 
liters (~1.4 gallons) per minute. His blood volume will be 60 ml per 
kg  (0.92  fl.  oz.  per  lb.)  or  4200  ml  (~1.1  gallons).  Assuming  his 
cardiac output can double under stress (as his heart beats faster and 
with  greater  force),  his  aortic  blood  flow  can  reach  11  liters  (~2.8 
gallons)  per  minute.  If  one  assumes  a  wound  that  totally  severs  the 
thoracic  aorta,  then  it  would  take  4.6  seconds  to  lose  20%  of  his 
blood  volume from  one  point of injury.  This is the  minimum  time in 
which a person could lose 20% of his blood volume. 

These theoretical ideas are confirmed by many observations of 
deer  almost  always  taking  5-10  seconds  to  fall  with  any 
broadside archery shot hit through the center of the chest.  In 
contrast,  we  have  observed  numerous  deer  drop  in  under  5 
seconds  when hit by handgun bullets creating pressure  waves 
at the larger end of the spectrum [COC06d].  Likewise, events 
of  apparently  involuntary  incapacitation  in  under  5  seconds 
are  repeatedly  reported  in  humans  for  handgun  shots  which 
fail to hit the CNS or supporting bone structure.

The Strasbourg tests employed a pressure sensor inserted into 
the  carotid  artery  of  live  unanaesthetized  goats  [STR93].  
These  tests  directly  suggest  that  an  internal  pressure  wave 
created  by  the  interaction  of  the  bullet  and  tissue  can 
contribute  to  rapid  incapacitation  and  can  incapacitate  more 
quickly than the crush cavity/blood loss mechanism alone:  

In  a  substantial  number  of  cases,  the  subject  was  incapacitated 
almost  instantly.    Each  time  this  occurred,  between  two  and  five 
pressure  spike  tracings  of  high  amplitude  and  short  duration  were 
found  which  immediately  preceded  and  matched  corresponding, 
diffused,  or  flattened  lines  (EEG  tracings).    Normally,  the  time  lag 
between  the  first  pressure  spike  and  the  beginning  of  slowed  or 
flattened  lines  was  between  30  and  40  milliseconds  (although  there 
were  several  cases  where  this  delay 
lasted  as  long  as  80 
milliseconds)…The  taller  pressure  spike  tracings  always  preceded 
the  slowed  or  flat  line  tracing…The  initial  spikes  had  to  be  of  a 
certain height in order for the animal to collapse immediately.

In  contrast  to  the  Strasbourg  result,  there  have  been  some 
arguments  against  the  pressure  wave  hypothesis.    Claims  to 
disprove  the  hypothesis  of  pressure  wave  incapacitation 
effects  usually  contain  one  or  more  of  the  following  flaws 
[PAT89, FAC96a, MAC94]: 
1.
It  is  fallacious  to  consider  pressure  wave  effects  in  terms  of 
velocity  ranges  rather  than  pressure  wave  magnitude  ranges.  
There is no velocity threshold where the pressure wave effects

begin to turn on.  There is a pressure wave magnitude threshold.
2.
It  is  fallacious  to  consider  easily  observable  wounding  rather  
than an observable measure of incapacitation.   It is important to 
consider the possibility of incapacitation mechanisms that might 
not  produce  wounding  that  is  easily  detectable  to  a  trauma 
surgeon  or  medical  examiner.    Consequently,  to  disprove  the 
pressure  wave  hypothesis,  one  would  have  to  observe  and 
measure  incapacitation  directly  rather  than  simply  observing 
wounding  after  the  fact.    To  our  knowledge,  there  is  no 
published data that fails to show a pressure wave contribution to 
incapacitation  over  the  full  range  of  peak  pressure  magnitudes 
produced by handgun loads.
3.
It  is fallacious  to  show  that  the  pressure  wave  does  not  make  a 
significant  contribution  to  incapacitation  in  a  pressure  wave 
regime considerably smaller than some available handgun loads.  
To  compare  different  handgun  loads,  we  consider  the  peak 
pressure on the edge of a 1" diameter circle centered on the axis 
of the  wound channel.   Handgun  loads  that produce 500  PSI at 
this  point  have  pressure  wave  incapacitation  effects  that  are 
difficult  to  discern  (require  a  very large  number  of data  points) 
with  shots  to  the  thoracic  cavity.    Handgun  loads  that  produce 
over  1000  PSI  at  this  point  and  penetrate  at  least  10"  have 
pressure  wave  contributions  that  are  relatively  easy  to  discern 
(don't require as many data points).  
4.
The  fact  that  some  previous  studies  make  a  weak  case  for  the 
pressure wave mechanism means that the effect has not yet been 
proven  in  the  published  literature.    This  does  not  mean  it  has 
been disproven.
5.
It  is  fallacious  to  consider  kinetic  energy  ranges  rather  than 
pressure wave ranges.  It is not sufficient to show the absence of 
a  pressure  wave  contribution  to  incapacitation  with  loads  that 
produce  a  certain  amount  of  kinetic  energy.  Disproving  the 
pressure  wave  hypothesis  requires  showing  the  absence  of  a 
pressure  wave  contribution  to  incapacitation  with  loads  that 
produce 1500 PSI on the edge of a 1" diameter circle centered at 
the wound channel.
6.
The  complete pressure  wave  (defined  as  the  force  per  unit  area 
that  would  be  measured  by  a  high-speed  pressure  transducer) 
must be considered.

Confusing the concepts of unproven and disproven

Considering only the "sonic pressure wave"

Considering kinetic energy ranges

Consequently, since  there  has  been  no convincing experimental 
disproof  of  the  pressure  wave  hypothesis,  we  should  consider 
that  the  hypothesis  of  a  pressure  wave  contribution  to  rapid 
incapacitation  has  substantial  anecdotal  support,  and  is  well 
supported by the Strasbourg tests [STR93].

There are also a number of papers in the peer-reviewed journals 
suggesting  ballistic  pressure  wave  effects  on  wounding  and 
incapacitation  [GIK88,  SHS87,  SHS88,  SHS89,  SHS90a, 
SHS90b,  WWZ04].    These  papers  are  mainly  concerned  with 

velocities of rifle bullets, but the energy transfer and pressure 
waves produced are within the regime of pistol bullets.

Suneson et al. [SHS90a, SHS90b] report that peripheral high-
energy missile hits cause pressure changes and damage to the 
nervous  system.    This  experimental  study  on  pigs  used  high-
speed  pressure  transducers  implanted  in  the  thigh,  abdomen, 
neck, carotid artery, and brain [SHS90a p 282]:

A small transducer . . . mounted in the end of a polyethylene catheter 
.  .  .  was  implanted  into  the  cerebral  tissue  in  the  left  frontoparietal 
region  about  10  mm  from  the  midline  and  5  mm  beneath  the  brain 
surface through a drill hole (6-mm diameter). 

The sensor implanted in the brain measured pressure levels as 
high  as  46  PSI  and  50  PSI  for  pigs  shot  in  the  thigh  as 
described.  (See  Figure  2C  and  2D  [SHS90a  p  284].)    The 
average  peak  positive  pressure  to  the  brain  over  the  different 
test shots with that set-up was 34.7 PSI +/- 9.7 PSI.  The error 
range  does  not

measurements,  but  rather  uncertainty  in  determination  of  the 
mean  because  of  significant  shot-to-shot  variations  in  the

pressure magnitude, the distant pressure  magnitude will show 
variation.)

in 

Apneic  periods  were  observed  during  the  first  few  seconds 
after  the  shot,  and  both  blood-brain  and  blood-nerve  barrier 
damage  were  found.      They  concluded  that  “distant  effects, 
likely to be caused by the oscillating high-frequency pressure 
waves,  appear  in  the  central  nervous  system  after  a  high-
energy missile extremity impact.”

Martin  Fackler  published  a  reply  to  Suneson  et  al.,  asserting 
that “Shock Wave” is a myth [FAC91a]:

In  ascribing  “local,  regional,  and  distant  injuries”  to  the  sonic 
pressure  wave,  Suneson  et  al.  have  overlooked  the  effect  of 
transmitted  tissue  movement  from  temporary  cavitation.    Since  two 
distinct mechanisms are acting in the Suneson et. al experiment, one 
cannot arbitrarily assign any effects observed to only one of them.

These  and  other  criticisms  of  Suneson  et  al.  are  exaggerated 
[COC06a].    In  fact,  the  results  of  Suneson  et  al.  also  find 
in  dogs 
substantial  agreement  with 
conducted  by  an  independent  research  group  using  a  similar 
methodology [WWZ04]:

later  experiments 

The most prominent ultrastructural changes observed at 8 hours after 
impact were myelin deformation, axoplasmic shrinkage, microtubular 
diminution, and reactive changes of large neurons in the high-speed 
trauma  group.    These  findings  correspond  well  to  the  results  of 
Suneson et al., and confirmed that distant effect exists in the central 
nervous system after a high-energy missile impact to an extremity.  A 
high-frequency  oscillating  pressure  wave  with  large  amplitude  and 
short duration was found in the brain after the extremity impact of a 
high-energy missile . . .

There  are  a  number  of  additional  papers  in  the  peer-reviewed 
journals  studying  the  damage  to  the  central  nervous  system 
caused  by  pressure  wave  effects  [TLM05  and  references 
therein].  Since their focus is on long-term effects, this research 
does  not  reach  definitive  conclusions  regarding  whether  these 
pressure  wave  effects  contribute  to  rapid  incapacitation  of 
humans.    However,  there  is  a  growing  body  of  evidence  that 
pressure  waves near  30  PSI  can cause  CNS damage  that  would 
usually be undetected by a trauma surgeon or medical examiner, 
but can be quantified with advanced neurological techniques.    

There is also well-established evidence that pressure waves near 
30  PSI  applied  to  the  brain  can  cause  immediate  incapacitation 
of  laboratory  animals.    In  a  study  applying  a  pressure  wave 
directly  to  the  brain  via  the  lateral  fluid  percussion  technique, 
Toth et al. [THG97] report both instantaneous incapacitation and 
cellular damage: 

The delivery of the pressure pulse was associated with brief (<120-200 
sec), transient  traumatic unconsciousness (as assessed by the duration 
of suppression of the righting reflex).

One  reasonably  wonders  what  relevance  these  live  animal 
experiments  using  the  lateral  fluid  percussion  technique  to 
induce  a  pressure  wave  injury  in  laboratory  animals  have  for 
understanding neurological pressure wave effects in humans.  A 
15-year  review  and  evaluation  of  this  question  concluded 
[TLM05]:

We conclude  that  the lateral fluid  percussion brain  injury model is an 
appropriate tool to study the cellular and mechanistic aspects of human 
traumatic brain injury…

Consequently, there is significant support for the hypothesis of a 
pressure wave contribution to incapacitation and injury not only 
in anecdotal observations and incapacitation studies in goats, but 
also in well-established results of neurological experiments.

In summary, there are published results showing that a pressure 
wave  can  cause  rapid  neurological  incapacitation  and/or  injury 
in  goats  [STR93],  dogs  [WWZ04],  swine  [SHS90a],  several 
species of laboratory rats [THG97, TLM05], and even in whales 
[KNO03].  In many of these cases, detecting wounding requires 
advanced  techniques  such  as  electron  microscopy,  cellular 
analysis,  EEG  monitoring,  and  sophisticated  chemical  analysis.  
A study  in  humans  also  demonstrates  the  potential  for  pressure 
wave injury in humans [OBW94].  

Consequently, the assertion that incapacitation is only caused by 
wounding  that  is  easily  detectable  to  the  trauma  surgeon  or 
medical examiner has been disproven.    This opens the door to

Marshall and Sanow methodology 
The  Marshall  and  Sanow  study  (MAS92,  MAS96)  collected 
data  for  a  large  number  of  shootings  with  a  wide  variety  of 
handgun 
the  relative 
effectiveness  of  different  handgun  loads.    The  selection 
criteria  included  events  where  a  criminal  attacker  was  hit  in 
the  thoracic  cavity  with  a  single  bullet  and  where  the  bullet 
and load could be accurately identified.

to  quantify 

loads 

Events  where  the  violent  attacker  ceased  the  attack  without 
striking another blow or firing another shot were classified as 
“one  shot  stops.”    Events  where  the  attacker  delivered 
subsequent blows, fired subsequent shots, or ran more than 10 
feet  were  classified  as  “failures.”    Events  where  the  attacker 
retreated  but  covered  less  than  10  feet  were  classified  as 
successful  stops  also.    The  “one  shot  stop”  percentage  was 
determined by dividing the total “stops” by the total number of 
events meeting the selection criteria (stops + failures).

The  Marshall  and  Sanow  methodology  has  been  subject  to 
some exaggerated criticisms [COC06a] that limit the accuracy 
of  the  data,  but  not  the  validity.    Most  epidemiological-type 
studies  of  this  size  and  complexity  represent  compromises 
between the breadth of the selection criteria and the number of 
data  points  available.    Other  researchers  might  have  made 
different  choices  about

bullets.

Strasbourg Tests
The  Strasbourg  tests  find  significant  experimental  support  in 
observations  of  remote  nerve  damage  in  pigs  [SHS90a, 
SHS90b],  experimental  observations  of  suppressed  EEG 
readings  in  swine  [GIK88],  experimental  observations  of 
remote  nerve  damage  and  suppressed  EEG  readings  in  dogs

neural  injury  due  to  a  pressure  wave  in  laboratory  rats 
[TLM05],  and  experiments  studying  incapacitation  in  deer 
[COC06d].

With  this  degree  of  validation  for  the  Strasbourg  tests, 
correlation between the Strasbourg data and the Marshall and 
Sanow data set represents substantial experimental support for 
the  validity  and  accuracy  of  the  Marshall  and  Sanow  OSS

One can consider the Marshall  and  Sanow data  and  ask  what 
bullet  performance  parameters  might  be  used  to  most 
accurately  predict  the  OSS  rating.    Performing  linear  least-
squares fits (using a third order polynomial) to the OSS ratings 
as  a  function  of  various  performance  parameters  yields  the 
correlation coefficients and standard errors shown in Table 1.  

The bullet performance parameters considered in the table are 
P1”,  the  peak  pressure  wave  magnitude  defined  above;  E,  the 
kinetic energy of the bullet; TSC, the volume of the temporary 
cavity;  V,  the  bullet  velocity;  MV,  the  bullet  mass  times  the 
velocity  or  the  bullet  momentum;  Vpcc,  the  volume  of  the 
permanent  crush  cavity;  and  Apcc,  the  surface  area  of  the 
permanent crush cavity.

the  Strasbourg  Tests 

Unlike 
in  which  pressure  wave 
magnitude  is  clearly  the  single  bullet  performance  parameter 
most highly correlated with incapacitation [COC06c], the OSS 
rating  is  also  highly  correlated  with  energy,  TSC,  and 
momentum.    This  is  because  the  OSS  ratings  include  a  wide 
variety  of  shot  angles  and  placements,  as  well  as  a 
shot 
considerable  voluntary  component,  whereas 
placement  and  angle  for  the  Strasbourg  tests  was  fixed,  and 
animal 
involuntary  aspects  of 
incapacitation in humans.  Parameters more strongly related to 
energy (energy, TSC, and pressure wave magnitude) all show 
a  higher  degree  of  correlation  than  the  parameters  more 
strongly related to penetration and wound cavity.

and  limiting  behaviors,  but  does  not  give  a  significantly  smaller

adequate  for  answering  which  bullet  performance  parameters  are 
more strongly related to the OSS rating.

Empirical model of OSS incapacitation rating

V.
Steve  Fuller  was the  first  to  confirm  a  high level  of correlation 
between the Strasbourg results and the Marshall and Sanow OSS 
rating [MAS96, Ch 28].  He also developed empirical models to 
predict  the  OSS  rating  from  parameters  measured  in  ballistic 
gelatin. 
these  predictive  models  was 
impressive,  but  objections  were  raised  [MAC97]  that  the 
empirical  models  Fuller  used  did  not  give  the  proper  limiting 
behavior  in  the  cases  of  very  large  and  small  independent 
variables.    One might also aspire to an empirical model that has 
fewer  adjustable  parameters (the  Fuller  best-fit  model  has  five) 
and gives more physical insight into incapacitation mechanisms.

  The  accuracy  of 

We  have  developed  an  alternative  empirical  model 
that 
addresses  this  objection  and  also  offers  insight  into  the  basic 
scaling  of  incapacitation  with  pressure  wave  magnitude  and 
permanent  cavity  size,  as  well  as  incorporating  the  laws  of 
probability  to  support  the  hypothesis  of  independent  pressure 
wave and crush cavity mechanisms. 

Considering the hypothesis that the ballistic pressure wave is an 
incapacitation mechanism that works independently of the crush 
cavity,  we can  write  the  probability of  the  pressure  wave (PW) 
mechanism failing to produce a one shot stop as:

P PW

where p is the peak pressure magnitude of a given load, and p0  is 
the characteristic pressure magnitude that would produce a 50% 
failure rate in the limiting case of a very small permanent crush 
cavity.  A possible experimental realization of this limiting case 
might  be  applying  a  pressure  wave  directly into  the  aorta  via  a 
catheter.

where  A  is  the  surface  area5  of  the  permanent  crush  cavity 
produced by a given load, and A0  is the characteristic surface 
area that would produce a 50% failure rate in the limiting case 
of a very small pressure wave.  An experimental realization of 
this  limiting  case  might  be  creating  a  wound  with  a  sharp 
instrument (such as an archery  broadhead) that would initiate 
bleeding in a cylinder with a surface area of approximately A
while only creating a very small pressure wave.

The  probability  of  a  one  shot  failure  when  the  independent 
mechanisms are both present is given by the product rule:

An  advantage  of  constructing  a  model  for  the  OSS  rating  by 
considering the pressure wave and crush cavity as independent 
mechanisms  is  that  the  model  can  then  be  used  to  determine 
the relative contributions of these mechanisms for each load.

                                                
5  Using  a  similar  approach  with  wound  volume  produces  a  slightly 
less accurate result.  The surface area of the permanent crush cavity is 
also preferred, because it stands to reason that the rate of blood loss 
should  depend  more  on  the  surface  area  of  wounded  tissue  than  on 
the volume of wounded tissue.

Fitting the data

A.
The model described above allows a non-linear least squares fit 
to be performed on the Marshall and Sanow OSS data set using 
the  peak  pressure  magnitude  p  and  the  surface  area A  of  the 
permanent  crush  cavity6  as  independent  variables  and  the 
characteristic  pressure  p0,  and  the  characteristic  area  A0  as 
adjustable parameters.  

computing the surface area of the permanent cavity created by 
a given load.  The best-fit parameters for 102 loads were  p0 = 
377  PSI  (+/-  30),  A0  =  28.5  Sq  in  (+/-  2.5),  standard  error  = 
6.2%.

However,  since  loads producing less  than  9.5”  of penetration 
produce  peak  pressure  waves  at  depths  too  shallow  to  have 
optimum effect,  the 9 loads  with penetration under 9.5”  were 
removed  from  the  data  set.7    The  best  fit  parameters  for  the 
remaining 93 loads (listed in Appendix B):

Best Fit Parameters:
p0 = 339 PSI (+/- 27.86)
A0 = 31.3 Sq in (+/- 3.102)
Standard Error = 5.6%
R = 0.939

The characteristic pressure wave magnitude needed for a 50% 
OSS  rating  is  smaller  if  one  considers  only  loads  penetrating 
at  least  9.5”  deep.    Shallow  penetrating  loads  increase  the 
peak pressure wave magnitude, but they do not place the wave 
deeply enough to have the optimal impact on vital organs.  In 
subsequent discussions, we will use the parameters determined 
for  the  93  handgun  loads  that  produce  at  least  9.5”  of 
penetration in ballistic gelatin, and we will consider this to be 
our “Best Fit” model for the Marshall and Sanow OSS rating.

This result compares favorably with Steve Fuller’s  “Best Fit” 
model [MAS96, Ch 28] that has a standard error of 4.79% but 
has  five  adjustable  parameters,  three  independent  variables, 
gives little information about the independent mechanisms that 
might  be  involved,  and  does  not  demonstrate  the  expected 
limiting  behavior  at  very  large  and  very  small  values  of  the 
independent  variables.   In contrast,  our  model only  uses two

interpretations),  two  independent  variables  that  are  directly 
related  to  independent  incapacitation  mechanisms,  and  gives

Interpreting the model

B.
For  a  penetration  depth  of  12”,  we  can  interpret  the 
characteristic  area  A0  =  31.3  square  inches  in  terms  of  an 
expanded  bullet  diameter  of  0.83”.    Likewise,  for  12”  of 
penetration,  we  can  interpret  the  characteristic  pressure  p0  = 
339 PSI in terms of a kinetic energy of 213 ft-lbs.

The  characteristic  pressure,  p0,  is  the  peak  pressure  magnitude 
that would give an OSS rating of 50% for the case of very small 
crush  cavity.    The  characteristic  area,  A0,  is  the  wound  surface 
area that would give an OSS rating of 50% for the case of a very 
small pressure wave.

The function,

Since there are very few shot angles that are capable of creating 
incapacitating  wounding  at  penetration  depths  beyond  20”, 
penetration  depths  exceeding  20”  were  truncated  to  20”  when

cylindrical  region  of  tissue  of  diameter  equal  to  the  recovered  final 
diameter of the bullet.

This  is  the  OSS  rating  for  a  given  permanent  crush  cavity  in

Permanent Crush Cavity Contribution to OSS Rating

is plotted for the best fit p0 in Figure 2.  This function represents 
the  independent  contribution  of  the  pressure  wave  to  the  OSS 
rating.    One  can  consider  this  to  be  the  OSS  rating  for  a  given 
pressure wave magnitude in the case of a very small permanent 
crush cavity. 

OSSPW(p) shows  the expected limiting behavior,  giving an  OSS 
rating of 0%  at  0  PSI and  increasing in a  monotonic  manner to 
an  OSS  rating  approaching  100%  at  very  large  pressure  wave 
magnitudes.    As  expected,  OSSPW(p)  is  equal  to  50%  at  its 
characteristic pressure, p0 = 339 PSI.  OSSPW(p) crosses 70% at a 
peak pressure  magnitude near 600 PSI (377 ft-lbs of energy  for 
12”  penetration).    OSSPW(p)  is  close  to  80%  at  a  peak  pressure 
magnitude  near  800  PSI  (502  ft-lbs  of  energy  for  12” 
penetration).    However,  the  OSS  rating  of  the  pressure  wave 
flattens considerably as the pressure rises above 800 PSI and (for 
very  small  permanent  crush  cavity)  does  not  reach  90%  until 
1400  PSI  (879  ft-lbs  of  energy  for  12”  penetration).    In  the 
absence of a significant crush cavity volume, the OSS rating for 
the  pressure  wave  does  not  reach  95%  until  nearly  2500  PSI 
(1570 ft-lbs for 12” penetration).

Figure  3:  The  best-fit  permanent  crush  cavity  OSS  rating  is

OSSPCC(A)  shows  the  expected  limiting  behavior,  giving  an 
OSS  rating  of  0%  at  0  sq.  in.  and  slowly  increasing  in  a 
monotonic manner to an OSS rating approaching 100% at very 
large  permanent  crush  cavities.    As  expected,  OSSPCC(A)  is 
equal  to  50%  at  its  characteristic  area,  A0  =  31.3  sq.  in.  
OSSPCC(A)  crosses  60%  at  an  area  near  40  sq.  in.  This 
corresponds to a final diameter of 1.06” for 12” penetration or 
a  final  diameter  of  0.80”  for  16”  of  penetration.    Very  large 
expanded diameters seem necessary to create  moderate levels 
of stopping power in the absence of pressure wave effects.  

OSSPCC(A)  is  close  to  70%  at  a  surface  area  near  55  sq.  in.  
This corresponds to an expanded diameter of 1.45” for 12” of 
penetration  and  an  expanded  diameter  of  1.09”  for  16”  of 
penetration.    In  the  absence  of  pressure  wave  effects,  the

the PCC  surface  area  rises above 50  sq.  in. and  (for  very small

This  corresponds  to  an  expanded  diameter  of  3.61”  for  12”  of 
penetration  and  an  expanded  diameter  of  2.71”  for  16”  of

would  not  be  possible  with  handgun  bullets  without  pressure

above  800  PSI,  the  effects  of  relatively  small  differences  in 
crush cavity volume become progressively less important.

Interpretation and Conclusions

VI.
Appendix  B  contains  a  table  giving  the  OSSPW,  OSSPCC,  and 
OSSTOTAL  ratings  for  93  different  handgun  loads.    It  is 

interesting to note how the independent pressure wave and crush 
cavity mechanisms can combine to produce total OSS ratings in 
different  loads.    For  example,  in  the  9mm  Win  147  grain  JHP, 
OSSPW  =  54.7%  and  OSSPCC=  47.1%.    These  two  independent 
mechanisms  combine  by  the  rules  of  probability  to  produce 
OSSTOTAL  =  76.0%.    (The  M&S  OSS  rating  is  74.1%  for  this 
load.)  

Most loads have a pressure wave contribution to the OSS rating 
that is  significantly  higher than  the  crush  cavity  contribution to 
the  OSS  rating.    For  example,  the  9mm  Fed  124  HS  +P+  has 
OSSPW  =  69.3%  and  OSSPCC=  46.1%.    These  two  mechanisms 
combine to produce OSSTOTAL  = 83.5%.  (The  M&S OSS rating 
is 85.5% for this load.)  The .380 ACP Fed 90 HS has OSSPW = 
52.6% and OSSPCC= 32.3%.  These two mechanisms combine to 
produce OSSTOTAL = 67.9%.  (The M&S OSS rating is 69.0% for 
this load.)  

The few loads for which the crush cavity contribution to the OSS 
rating  exceeds  the  pressure  wave  contribution  are  loads  that  do 
not  expand.    For  example,  the  Fed  158  grain  semi-wad  cutter 
(SWC) in .38  Special has OSSPW = 20.3%  and OSSPCC= 38.1%. 
These  two  mechanisms  combine  to  produce  OSSTOTAL  =  50.6%.  
(The  M&S  OSS  rating  is  51.8%  for  this  load.)    Similarly,  the 
Rem  230  grain  FMJ  in  .45  ACP  has  OSSPW  =  39.0%  and 
OSSPCC=  46.2%.  These  two  mechanisms  combine  to  produce 
OSSTOTAL  =  67.2%.    (The  M&S  OSS  rating  is  64.8%  for  this 
load.)  

The standard error of the model is 5.6% which gives the typical 
level of accuracy when comparing the model to the actual M&S 
OSS  ratings.    Some  loads  have  a  noticeably  larger  deviation 
from  the  model  than  the  standard  error.    We  believe  that  there 
are  several  factors  that  can  cause  a  load  to  exhibit  a  deviation 
from the model that is noticeably larger than the standard error.8  

We  believe  that  loads  significantly  over-perform  (compared  to 
the model) because:

8 Most loads that significantly over-perform or under-perform the 
predictions of our model also deviate significantly from all of Steve 
Fuller’s models.
9 We did not account for fragmentation in our initial estimates of 
pressure magnitude because we were unable to obtain data on the

for testing.

circumstances  might include  better training and  discipline  for 
departments using the load.

The  Remington  125  grain  JHP  load  in  .357  Magnum  is  an 
example  of  an  over-performing  load.    This  load  has  model 
OSSTOTAL  =  87.1%  but  an  actual  M&S  OSS  rating  of  96.1%.  
This  OSS  rating  includes  204  shooting  events,  so  the 
uncertainty  can  be  estimated  as  3.5%.    Accounting  for 
fragmentation10  raises  the  peak  pressure  magnitude  estimate 
from  796.8  PSI  to  1274.9  PSI,  which  raises  the  OSSPW  from 
78.2%  to  87.9%.    This  increased  OSSPW  combines  with  an 
OSSPCC  =  40.5%  to  create  an  increased  OSSTOTAL  =  92.8%.  
This  does  not  completely  account  for  the  difference  between 
the  model  and  the  M&S  OSS  rating  of  96.1%,  but  it  does 
bring them significantly closer.

Another  over-achieving  load  is  the  Cor-Bon  135  grain  JHP 
load in .40 S&W.  This load has model OSSTOTAL = 88.1% but 
an  actual  M&S  OSS  rating  of  95.8%.    Accounting  for 
fragmentation11  raises  the  peak  pressure  magnitude  estimate 
from  988.2  PSI  to  1383.5  PSI,  which  raises  the  OSSPW  from 
83.2%  to  89.1%.    This  increased  OSSPW  combines  with  an 
OSSPCC  =  29.0%  to  create  an  increased  OSSTOTAL  =  92.3%.  
This  does  not  completely  account  for  the  difference  between 
the  model  and  the  M&S  OSS  rating  of  95.8%,  but  it  brings 
them closer.

Many loads that significantly under-perform our best-fit model 
are loads with large levels of recoil suggesting the possibility 
of a higher percentage of abdominal hits than occurring in the 
data set as a whole.12  For example, the Win 210 grain JHP in 
.41 Magnum has an OSSTOTAL = 91.9% but only has M&S OSS 
rating of 82.4%.  The Rem 210 grain JSP in .41 Magnum has 
an OSSTOTAL  =  91.9%  but the M&S OSS  rating  falls far short 
of  this  at  80.7%.    The  Win  225  grain  Silvertip  load  in  .45 
Long Colt has an OSSTOTAL = 84.4% but the M&S OSS rating 
falls far short of this at 73.6%.

Beyond  the  ability  to  predict  the  OSS  rating  from  bullet 
important 
performance  parameters,  our  model  provides 
insights into the relative contributions of the permanent crush 
cavity and ballistic pressure wave.  To the degree of accuracy 
possible  with  this  data  set,  the  permanent  crush  and  pressure 
wave  mechanisms  appear  to  be  independent.    For  most  JHP

30% and an average fragment penetration depth of 33% of the overall 
penetration depth.
11 As described in Appendix A, using a fragmentation percentage of 
40% and an average fragment penetration depth of 50% of the overall 
penetration depth.  The 135 grain Nosler JHP bullet sheds larger 
fragments than the 125 grain Remington JHP in .357 Magnum, so the 
fragments tend to penetrate more deeply.
12 Marshall and Sanow make no mention of the ratio of abdominal to 
chest hits in their data set.  Loads that have a higher percentage of 
abdominal hits would be expected to have a lower OSS rating in their 
data set.

10

handgun loads, the pressure wave contribution to the OSS rating 
is  significantly  larger  than  the  crush  cavity  contribution.    Our 
model  provides  a  way  to  quantify  the  trade-offs  inherent  when 
considering  increasing  one  bullet  performance  parameter  at  the 
expense of another. 

Cautions and Limits of Interpretation

A.
The  M&S  OSS  rating 
is  a  relative  measure  of  bullet 
effectiveness  that  does  not  predict  the  outcome  of  specific 
shooting events but rather compares the relative effectiveness of 
different  handgun  loads.    Our  model  should  be  considered  the 
same way.  A OSS rating of 90% does NOT mean that a load has 
a 90% chance of stopping a deadly attack with a hit to the torso, 
it simply means that a load is likely to perform better than a load 
with an 80% OSS rating and worse than a load with a 96% OSS 
rating.    Of  course,  the  data  set  includes  both  voluntary  and 
involuntary  stops,  so  the  model  gives  no  indication  of  the  real 
probability of stopping a particularly determined attacker.

Since the model was developed using only loads that penetrate at 
least  9.5”,  it  should  only  be  considered  valid  for  loads  that 
penetrate  at  least  9.5”. 
  Bullets  that  penetrate  less  will 
underperform predictions based on this model.

We’ve  shown  that  an  empirical  model  of  the  OSS  rating  of  a 
load  can  be  developed  from  parameters  measured  in  ballistic 
gelatin.    However,  our  model  based  on  the  Strasbourg  tests 
makes  more  accurate  OSS  predictions  for  JHP  handgun  loads 
than  our  gelatin-based  model.    This  suggests  that  live  animal 
testing  can  be  productively  incorporated  into  testing  of  bullet 
effectiveness.  Since our deer testing methodology [COC06d] is 
well  correlated  with  the  Strasbourg  tests  and  deer  are  widely 
available,  deer  testing  of  service  caliber  handgun  loads  can  be 
considered a valuable addition to gelatin testing.

The  M&S  OSS  rating  contains  a  significant  component  of 
voluntary incapacitation.  The approach here folds all voluntary 
incapacitation  into  the  pressure  wave  and  permanent  cavitation 
contributions.    It  would  be  possible  to  model  the  voluntary 
independent 
contribution 
incapacitation  mechanism,  combine 
independent 
probability functions by the rules of probability, and do a least-
squares fit to the resulting composite model.  This could estimate 
independent  OSS  contributions  for  voluntary,  permanent  crush, 
and pressure wave effects.

to 

This approach can be generalized to any number of independent 
effects  and  points  out  the  benefit  of  new  technologies  which 
would  utilize  new  incapacitation  mechanisms  not  currently 
employed with current technology.  

In  conclusion,  this  analysis  shows  that,  all  other  factors  being 
equal, bullets that produce pressure  waves of greater magnitude 
incapacitate  more  rapidly  than  bullets  that  produce  smaller 
pressure waves.  The M&S OSS data convincingly supports the 
pressure wave hypothesis and allows (perhaps for the first time) 

11

human  incapacitation  to  be  modeled  as  a  function  of  peak 
ballistic pressure wave magnitude.  

Implications for Bullet Testing and Selection           

B.
The  success  of  our  empirical  model  in  describing  bullet 
effectiveness  suggests  that  it  might  be  used  for  predicting 
bullet effectiveness before data from actual shooting events is 
available.    Estimating  an  OSS  rating  from  actual  shootings 
requires  at  least  80  shooting  events  meeting  the  selection 
criteria  to  provide  the  expected  level  of  accuracy  offered  by 
our  model.    Both  the  pressure  wave  magnitude  and  surface 
area  of  the  permanent  crush  cavity  can  easily  be  determined 
by  using  a  chronograph  to  measure  bullet  energy  and  results 
to 
from  shooting 
determine  final  bullet  diameter,  penetration  depth,  and 
retained mass.

into  calibrated  10%  ballistic  gelatin 

However,  one  should  not  be  overly  impressed  by  the 
propensity  for  shallow  penetrating  loads  to  produce  larger 
pressure waves.  Bullet selection criteria should first determine 
the  required  penetration  depth  for  the  given  risk  assessment 
and  application,  and  only  use  pressure  wave  magnitude  as  a 
selection criterion for bullets that meet a minimum penetration 
requirement.

Reliable  expansion,  penetration,  feeding,  and  functioning  are 
all important aspects of load testing and selection.  We do not 
advocate abandoning long-held aspects of the load testing and 
selection process, but it seems prudent to consider the pressure 
wave magnitude and the predicted OSS rating along with other 
factors.

Implications for Bullet Design

C.
The  trend  in  bullet  design  over  the  last  decade  has  drifted 
toward  bullets  with 
little  fragmentation  and  a  higher 
percentage  of  retained  mass.    Bullets  that  both  fragment  and 
meet minimum penetration requirements create larger pressure 
wave magnitudes and offer improved incapacitation potential.  

In  addition  to  moving  toward  designs  which  both  penetrate 
and  fragment  reliably,  we  believe  that  the  incapacitation 
potential  of  a  bullet  can  be  further  improved  by  delaying 
expansion and fragmentation to a penetration depth of at least 
4”.    This  would  place  the  peak  pressure  magnitude  closer  to 
vital organs.

Optimal  use  of  a  bullet’s  kinetic  energy  to  produce  pressure 
wave  incapacitation  suggests  a  bullet  design  that  penetrates 
the first 4” or so prior to significant expansion or energy loss, 
and  then  rapidly  expands  and  transfers  a  large  percentage  of 
its energy and 40% of its mass at penetration depths between 
4-8” before continuing to penetrate to the depth desired for the 
application.

Appendix A: Accounting for Fragmentation in Estimating 
the Peak Pressure Wave Magnitude
If kinetic  energy  and  penetration depth  are  equal,  bullets  that 
fragment create a larger pressure wave than bullets that retain 
100%  of their  mass.   This  is  because  the  average  penetration 
depth is shorter  than the  maximum penetration depth.  Recall 
that  the  average  force  with  no  mass  loss  is  given  by 
[COC06C]

Fave = E/d,

where  E  is  the  kinetic  energy  and  d  is  the  maximum 
penetration depth.

If  we  consider  the  case  of  a  bullet  with  some  fraction,  f,  of 
mass lost to fragmentation, the fraction of retained mass is (1-
f) and the average force is then given by

Fave = (1-f)E/d + f E/df,

where  df  is  the  center  of  mass  of  all  the  bullet  mass  lost  to 
fragmentation.    In  other  words,  df  is  the  average  penetration 
depth  of  the  fragments.    Most  fragments  do  not  penetrate  as 
deeply  as  the  maximum  penetration  depth  d,  so  that  the 
average  fragment  penetration  depth  df  can  be  expressed  as  a 
fraction of the maximum penetration depth

System.  A  Light  and  Electron  Microscopic  Study  on  Pigs.  The 
Journal of Trauma. 30(3):295-306; 1990.

df = d/k,

where  k  is  greater  than  1.    Consequently,  the  average  force 
becomes,

[STR93]  The  Strasbourg  Tests,  presented  at  the  1993  ASLET 
International Training Conference, Reno, Nevada.

Fave = (1-f)E/d + f k E/d.

This can be rewritten as

13

Fave = [1 + f (k-1)]E/d.

So we see that the enhancement factor for the average force is [1 
+ f(k – 1)], where f is the fraction of lost mass, and k describes 
the relative penetration depth of the mass lost by fragmentation.  
If the mass lost by fragmentation penetrates ½ of the maximum 
penetration depth on average, k = 2, and the enhancement factor 
for  the  average  force  is  (1+f).    In  other  words,  a  40%  loss  of 
mass increases the average force (and thus the pressure wave) by 
40%.  

If the mass lost by fragmentation penetrates ⅓ of the maximum 
penetration depth on average, k = 3, and the enhancement factor 
for  the  average  force  is  (1+2f).    In  other  words,  a  40%  loss  of 
mass increases the average force (and thus the pressure wave) by 
80%.

Consequently,  bullets  that  fragment  can  create  larger  pressure 
waves  than  bullets  that  do  not  fragment  but  have  the  same 
kinetic energy and penetration depth.  Most  fragmenting bullets 

have an average fragment penetration depth of ⅓ to ½ of their 
maximum  penetration  depth,  so  that  the  pressure  wave 
enhancement factor is between (1+f) and (1+2f). 

About the Authors
Michael  Courtney  earned  a  PhD  in  Physics  from  the  Massachusetts 
Institute  of  Technology.    He  currently  serves  as  Director  of  the 
Forensic  Science program at  Western Carolina  University.   Michael 
has taught college level Physics, Statistics, and Forensic Science.  He 
in  analysis  of  complex  systems, 
has  extensive  experience 
instrumentation  and  measurement,  and  data  analysis.    Michael 
founded the Ballistics Testing Group in 2001 to study incapacitation 
ballistics and reconstruction of shooting events.  

Amy Courtney earned a MS in Biomedical Engineering from Harvard 
and a PhD in Medical Engineering and Medical Physics from a joint 
Harvard/MIT program.  She was a research scientist for Reebok, Inc., 
and  the  Cleveland Clinic, as well as on  the  Biomedical Engineering 
faculty of Ohio State University.  Her area of specialty is the failure 
of  visco-elastic  biological  tissues  under  applied  force,  pressure,  and 
strain.      Her  strengths  are  experimental  design,  statistical  analysis, 
and  measurement  instrumentation.    She  has  been  a  member  of  the 
Ballistics Testing Group since it was founded in 2001.

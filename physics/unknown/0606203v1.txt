Statistical distances between countries and

macroeconomic indices fluctuations*

Abstract 
 
The  paper  applies  some  recent  developments  of  network  analysis  in  order  to  perform  a 
comparative study of EU countries in relation with the fluctuations of some macroeconomic 
indicators.  The  statistical  distances  between  countries,  calculated  for  various  moving 
average time  windows, are mapped into the ultrametric subdominant space as in classical 
Minimal  Spanning  Tree  methods.  The  novelty  consists  in  applying  the  so-called  Moving 
Average  Minimal  Length  Path  (MAMLP)  algorithm,  which  allows  a  decoupling  of 
fluctuations with respect to the mass center of the system from the movement of the mass 
center itself. The present analysis pertains to the Gross Domestic Product and some of its 
sources,  namely  the  Final  Consumption  Expenditure,  Gross  Capital  Formation  and  Net 
Exports growth rates. The target group of countries is composed of 15 EU countries, data 
taken between 1972 and 2004, i.e., before the last wave of integration. The method allows 
us  to  search  for  a  cluster-like  structure  when  derived  both  from  the  hierarchical 
organization of countries and from their relative movement inside the hierarchy. It is found 
that  the  strongly  correlated  countries  with  respect  to  GDP  fluctuations  can  be  partitioned 
into  stable  clusters.  Some  of  the  highly  correlated  countries,  with  respect  to  GDP 
fluctuations, display strong correlations also in the Final Consumption Expenditure, while 
others are strongly correlated in Gross Capital Formation. On the other hand, one notices 
the  similitude  of  the  classifications  regarding  GDP  and  Net  Exports  fluctuations  as 
concerns  the  squared  sum  of  the  correlation  coefficients  (so  called  country  “sensitivity”). 
We  find  that,  as  for  social  networks,  there  is  a  positive  correlation  between  the  node 
sensitivities  i.e.  the  high  connected  countries  commonly  tend  to  connect  with  other  well 
connected ones. The final structure proves to be stable against the fluctuations induced by 
the moving time window over the scanned time interval.

1    Introduction 
 
The  political  and  social  evolution  of  EU  countries  during  the  last  decade 
points out to both cohesion and centrifugal tendencies that are expected to 
exert some influence on their macroeconomic evolution. Various and quite 
different  positions  have  been  adopted  in  relation  with  political  issues  (the 
war of Iraq, the EU extension, the EU Constitution), but also in relation to 
particular  economic  issues,  e.g.  the  common  currency,  the  interest  rates, 
environmental problems. To analyse the impact of each one of these factors 
upon  the  whole  EU  system  as  well  as  the  role  that  each  country  plays  are 
rather  difficult  tasks,  taking  into  account  that  two  or  more  countries  may 
adopt  the  same  position  with  respect  to  a  problem,  and  opposite  positions 
with respect to another one.  
     On the other hand, in the course of nature, the European countries can be 
considered as interacting agents of a complex system; it is expected that the 
economic  fluctuations  which  occur  in  one  country  influence  in  turns  the 
fluctuations  in  the  other  ones,  especially  those  having  the  strongest 
economic  connections  with  the  former.  This  aspect  leads  to  imagine  a 
hierarchical  organisation  and  a  cluster-like  structure  of  EU  countries,  as 
found in many natural and social complex systems investigated so far. The 
goal  of  the  present  paper  is  not  to  analyse  the  impact  of  major  events  or 
political  decisions  on  this  system,  but  to  investigate  the  strongest 
correlations and anti-correlations in the dynamical evolution of some macro-
economic  indicators  in  an  empirical  way,  focusing  on  those  which  are  the 
most closely related to development i.e. the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
and GDP/capita, as well as the ones which are usually considered for GDP 
estimation:  the  Final  Consumption  Expenditure  (FCE),  the  Gross  Capital 
Formation (GCF) and the Net Exports (NEX = exports – imports of goods 
and services).  
     There  is  a  large  literature  devoted  to  the  distribution  of  shocks  to  GDP 
growth rates and their standard deviation scaling properties (e.g. Canning et 
al (1998), and references therein), and also numerous papers analyzing the 
cross-correlations  between  OECD  countries  from  various  points  of  view. 
One could mention here Cooper and Haltiwanger, (1996) where emphasis is 
placed  on  calibrating  models  to  explain  the  variances  and  covariances  of 
macroeconomic  variables,  Kraay  and  Ventura  (2002),  which  sets  off  the 
remarkable  degree  of  synchronization  of  the  business  cycles  in  OECD 
countries  and  Ludwig  and  Sløk  (2004),  which  analyze  the  relationship 
between  stock  prices,  house  prices  and  consumption  using  data  for  16 
OECD countries.  
     The  present  paper tries  to  set the  problem  of  cross-correlations  into  the 
general frameworks of classification trees and complex systems analysis. It 
is  well  known  that  a  general  question  facing  researchers  in  many  areas  of 
inquiry is how to organize observed data into meaningful structures, that is, 
to develop taxonomies. In this sense, cluster analysis is an exploratory data 
analysis  tool  which  aims  at  sorting  different  objects  into  groups  in  a  way 

 

 

that the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong 
to the same group and minimal otherwise. The term “cluster analysis” (first 
used  by  Tryon,  1939)  refers  to  a  number  of  different  algorithms  and 
methods  for  grouping  objects  of  similar  kinds  into  respective  categories. 
Unlike  many  other  statistical  procedures,  cluster  analysis  methods  are 
mostly used when we do not have any a priori hypothesis, but are still in a 
exploratory  research  phase.  In  general,  whenever  one  needs  to  classify  a 
large amount of information into manageable meaningful sequences, cluster 
analysis is of great utility. 
     As  we  intend  to  build  a  cluster-like  structure  based  on  the  strongest 
correlations  and  anti-correlations  between  time  series,  our  approach  has 
some  common  points  with  other  classification  tree  methods  of  interest  in 
statistics. Long ago, methods as CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic Interaction 
Detector) proposed by Kass (1980), the classical C&R Trees (Classification 
and  Regression  Trees)  Algorithm  (Breiman  et  al.,  1984)  and  other  tree 
classification  techniques  have  been  discussed.  They  are  known  to  have  a 
number  of  advantages  over  many  other  techniques.  In  most  cases,  the 
interpretation  of  results  summarized  as  on  a  tree  is  very  simple.  This 
simplicity  is  useful  not  only  for  purposes  of  rapid  classification  of  new 
observations, but can also often yield a simple “model” for explaining why 
observations  are  ordered  or  predicted  in  a  particular  manner.  On  the  other 
hand, the final results of using tree methods for classification or regression 
can  be  summarized  in  a  series  of  (usually  few)  logical  if-then  conditions 
(tree  nodes).  Therefore,  there  is  no  implicit  assumption  on  the  underlying 
relationships  between  the  predictor  variables.  Thus,  tree  methods  are 
particularly  well  suited  for  data  mining  tasks,  when  there  is  often  little  a 
priori  knowledge  nor  any  coherent  set  of  theories  or  predictions  regarding 
which variables are related and how.  
     As  a  matter  of  fact,  the  present  paper  deals  with  a  classification-type 
problem that is to predict values of a categorical dependent variable (class, 
group membership, etc.) from a predictor variable which is - in our approach 
- the correlation coefficient.  
     A tree clustering method uses  the dissimilarities (similarities) measured 
as distances between objects when forming the clusters. Therefore, in tree-
like  classifications,  the  first  problem  is  to  choose  an  adequate  distance 
measure in order to place progressively greater weight on objects (say series 
{xi} and {yi}) that are further apart.  
     Various  definitions  are  proposed  in  the  statistics  literature  so  far.  We 
recall here only those of common use, as the Euclidean distance:

The first method has a few advantages (e.g., the distance between any two 
objects is not affected by the addition of new objects in the analysis, which 
may  be  outliers).  In  (1.2)  the  effect  of  outliers  is  dampened  since  they  are 
not squared. The distance (1.1) can be generalized as a power distance:

     As we aim to build a hierarchical structure starting from the correlations 
between  time  series,  in  the  present  work  we  opted  for  (1.4),  though  we 
recognize that other choices could be possible. 
     The  method  used  here  below,  namely  the  moving-average-minimal-
length-path (MAMLP) is described in Section 2, with other several related 
techniques.  In  essence,  MAMLP  was  derived  by  applying  the  minimal-
length-path-to-average  classification  to  various  moving  time  windows.  In 
other words, as a first step, for each time window a hierarchy of countries 
was  found  taking  their  minimal  path  distance  on  average;  thereafter,  in  a 
second  step  the  strongest  correlations  and  anti-correlations  between  the 
movements of countries inside the hierarchy were investigated.    
     In  Section  2.4  the  macroeconomic  indicators  whose  fluctuations*  have 
been considered are briefly presented, and also, the data sources which are 
used.  The  target  group  of  countries  is  composed  of  15  EU  countries;  the 
data  refers  to  years  between  1972  and  2004  (for  the  10  years  size  time 
window  analysis)  and  between  1994  and  2004  (for  the  5  years  size  time 
window analysis case), that is before the last wave of EU extension. 
     The  results  are  presented  in  Section  3.  This  section  has  a  tri-partite 
structure,  grouping  the  results  in  relation  with  the  multiple  aims  of  our 
investigation: first, the relevant role of the time window size is pointed out 
by  studying  GDP/capita  in  two  moving  time  windows  of  10  and  5  years 
sizes respectively; secondly, GDP is investigated in a moving time window 
                                                 
* The term “fluctuations” refers to the annual rates of growth of the considered indicators. 

 

 

of  5  years,  and  the  MAMLP  method  is  applied  to  find  the  strongest 
correlations  and  anti-correlations  between  countries,  which  result  in  a 
cluster-like structure; thirdly, the same method is applied to the other three 
indicators  (FCE,  GCF  and  NEX),  which  are  usually  considered  as  basic 
ingredients in the GDP estimations. 
     Conclusions are found in Section 4. A statistical test of robustness, – the 
shuffled data analysis – is done in Appendix.               
 
 
2    Theoretical and methodological framework 
 
2.1    The Minimal Spanning Tree (MST) 
 
First  used  by  Mantegna  (1999)  in  the  econophysics  field,  the  MST  can  be 
seen  as  a  modern  extension  of  the  Horizontal-  (or  Vertical-)  Hierarchical-
Tree-Plot – an older clustering method well known for its large applicability 
in  medicine,  psychiatry  and  archeology  (Hartigan,  1975).  The  essential 
additional  ingredients  of  MST  consist  in  the  use  of  the  ultrametric 
subdominant space and of the ultrametric distance between objects. 
     In the above cited paper Mantegna analyzed the correlations between the 
30 stocks used to calculate the Dow Jones Industrial Average, on one hand, 
and  correlations  between  the  companies  used  to  calculate  the  S&P  500 
index,  on  the  other  hand,  for  the  July  1989  to  October  1995  time  span  in 
both cases. Only the companies which were present in the S&P 500 index 
during  the  whole  time  interval  were  considered  i.e.,  443  stocks.  The 
correlation coefficients C(x, y) of the returns for all possible pairs of stocks 
were computed.  A metric distance between two stocks was defined by: 
  

d(x, y) = 1 – [C(x, y)]2

 
     These  distances  become  the  elements  of  the  distance  matrix  D,  from 
which  he  determined  a  topological  arrangement  between  the  different 
stocks.  His  study  could  also  give  some  empirical  evidence  about  the 
existence  and  nature  of  common  economic  factors  which  drive  the  time 
evolution of stock prices. He determined the minimum spanning tree (MST) 
connecting the different indices, and thereafter, the subdominant ultrametric 
structure  and  hierarchical  organization  of  the  indices.  In  fact,  the  elements 
ijdˆ
  are  determined  from  the  MST, 
where 

 is the maximum Euclidian distance detected by moving from i to j 

  of  the  ultrametric  distance  matrix 

Dˆ

ijdˆ

by single steps through the path connecting i to j in the MST. Studying the 
MST and the hierarchical organization of the stocks defining the Dow Jones 
industrial  average,  Mantegna  showed  that  the  stocks  can  be  divided  into 
three  groups.  Carrying  the  same  analysis  for  the  stocks  belonging  to  the 

 

 

S&P500, Mantegna (1999) obtained clusters of the stocks according to the 
industry they belong to. 
 
 
2.2    Local Minimal Spanning Tree and the Minimal Length 
Path algorithms  
 
Unlike  the  high  frequency  financial  data  series,  the  macroeconomic  time 
series are too short and noisy.  Most macroeconomic data have a yearly or at 
most quarterly frequency. When such time series have been produced for a 
very long period, there is usually strong evidence against stationarity. A way 
for  investigating  such  time  series  can  only  be  by  moving  a  constant  size 
time window with a constant step so that the whole time interval is scanned. 
     Moreover,  when  too  small  differences  between  the  linkage  distances 
arise, MST seems to be not unique. This aspect can lead either to a maximal 
dispersed  structure  (each  object  is  in  a  class  by  itself)  or,  contrarily,  to  a 
high clustered structure in which all objects are joined together. This aspect 
was signaled by many authors (e.g. Bouchaud and Potters, 2000).  
     Some  alternative  ways  for  constructing  the  hierarchy,  better  adapted  to 
the  low  frequency  time  series  have  been  recently  proposed.  The  Local 
Minimum  Spanning  Tree  (LMST)  is  a  modification  of  the  MST  algorithm 
under the constraint that the initial pair of nodes (the root) of the tree is the 
pair with the strongest correlation. Correlation chains have been investigated 
in  the  context  of  the  most  developed  countries  clustering  in  two  forms: 
unidirectional and bidirectional minimum length chains (UMLP and BMLP 
respectively)  (Miskiewicz  and  Ausloos,  2005).  UMLP  and  BMLP 
algorithms  are  simplifications  for  LMST,  where  the  closest  neighbouring 
countries are attached at the end of a chain. In the case of the unidirectional 
chain the initial node is an arbitrary chosen country. Therefore in the case of 
UMLP  the  chain  is  expanded  in  one  direction  only,  whereas  in  the 
bidirectional case countries might be attached at one of both ends depending 
on the distance value.  These authors also underlined some arbitrariness in 
the  root  of  the  tree  for  comparing  results,  and  considered  that  an  a  priori 
more common root, like the sum of the data, called the “All” country, from 
which to let the tree grow was permitting a better comparison.  
 
 
2.3    The Moving-Average Minimal Length Path (MAMLP) 
Method 
 
The problem that MST cannot be built in a unique way becomes even more 
important when we try to construct a cluster hierarchy for each position of a 
moving  time  window.  The  hierarchical  structure  proved  to  be  not  robust 
against  fluctuations  induced  by  a  moving  time  window.  Simply,  if  the 
statistical  distances  between  pairs  A-B  and  C-D  belonging  to  different 

 

 

clusters are small, it is quite likely to find at the next step A-C and B-D as 
pairs in other different clusters.  
     In  the  MAMLP  method  described  here  below  we  propose  to  construct 
the hierarchy also starting from a virtual ‘average’ agent. In fact, the method 
of  decoupling  the  movement  of  the  mass  center  and  the  movement  of 
independent parts is quite of common use in physics and statistics.  
   The method is developed in the following steps: 

i. 

ii. 

iii. 

iv. 

v. 

An  ‘AVERAGE’  agent  (AV)  is  virtually  included  into  the 
system; 
The statistical distance matrix is constructed, and thereafter, the 
elements are set into increasing order (i.e. the decreasing order of 
correlations); 
The  hierarchy  is  constructed,  connecting  each  agent  by  its 
minimal  length  path  to  AV.  Its  minimal  distance  to  AV  is 
associated to each agent. 
The procedure is repeated by moving a given and constant time 
time  span.  The  statistical 
window  over 
properties of the datasets are investigated. 
The  agents  are  sorted  either  through  their  mean  position  in  the 
hierarchy  during  the  period  investigated,  or  through  their 
movement inside the hierarchy. In the former case, the distances 
to the AV are normalized to the spanning range of the hierarchy. 
In  the  latter  version,  a  new  correlation  matrix  between  country 
distances to their own mean is constructed. 

investigated 

the 

 
 
2.4    Data sources 
 
Macroeconomic  indicators  freely  taken  from  the  web  form  the  data  base 
used  for  the  present  investigations.  We  consider:  (a)  Annual  percentage 
growth rate of GDP and GDP/capita at market prices based on constant local 
currency.  Aggregates  are  based  on  constant  2000  U.S.  dollars.  GDP  is  the 
sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any 
product  taxes  and  minus  any  subsidies  not  included  in  the  value  of  the 
products.  It  is  calculated  without  making  deductions  for  depreciation  of 
fabricated  assets  or  for  depletion  and  degradation  of  natural  resources.  (b) 
Average annual growth of Final Consumption Expenditure (FCE) based on 
constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2000 U.S. dollars. 
Final Consumption Expenditure (formerly total consumption) is the sum of 
household  final  consumption  expenditure  (formerly  private  consumption) 
and  general  government  final  consumption  expenditure  (formerly  general 
government  consumption);  (c)  Annual  growth  rate  of  Gross  Capital 
Formation (GCF) based on constant local currency. Aggregates are based on 
constant  2000  U.S.  dollars.  Gross  Capital  Formation  (formerly  gross 
domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the fixed assets of 
the  economy  plus  net  changes  in  the  level  of  inventories.  Fixed  assets 

 

 

include  land  improvements  (fences,  ditches,  drains,  and  so  on);  plant, 
machinery,  and  equipment  purchases;  and  the  construction  of  roads, 
railways,  and  the  like,  including  schools,  offices,  hospitals,  private 
residential  dwellings,  and  commercial  and  industrial  buildings.  Inventories 
are  stocks  of  goods  held  by  firms  to  meet  temporary  or  unexpected 
fluctuations in production or sales, and "work in progress." According to the 
1993  SNA,  net  acquisitions  of  valuables  are  also  considered;  (d)  Annual 
growth rate of net exports (NEX), calculated as the difference between the 
annual growths rates of exports and imports of goods and services based on 
constant local currency. Aggregates are based on constant 2000 U.S. dollars. 
Exports  of  goods  and  services  represent  the  value  of  all  goods  and  other 
market  services  provided  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  Imports  of  goods  and 
services represent the value of all goods and other market services received 
from the rest of the world. They include the value of merchandise, freight, 
insurance,  transport, travel,  royalties, license fees, and other  services, such 
as  communication,  construction,  financial,  information,  business,  personal, 
and  government  services.  They  exclude  labor  and  property  income 
(formerly called factor services) as well as transfer payments. including here 
the  value  of  merchandise,  freight,  insurance,  transport,  travel,  royalties, 
license  fees,  and  other  services,  such  as  communication,  construction, 
financial, information, business, personal, and government services.  
     The main source used for all the above indicators annual rates of growth 
taken between 1972 and 2004 is here below the World Bank database: 
http://devdata.worldbank.org/query/default.htm. 
     In addition to the above mentioned data bank, for comparison aims, we 
also used the data supplied by: 
http://www.economicswebinstitute.org/concepts.htm (1986-2000); 
http://www.oecd.org/about/0,2337,en_2649_201185_1_1_1_1_1,00.html 
(2003-2004). 
     We abbreviate the countries according to The Roots Web Surname List 
(RSL) which uses 3 letters standardized abbreviations to designate countries 
and  other  regional  locations  (http://helpdesk.rootsweb.com/codes/).  Inside 
the tables, for spacing reasons we use the countries two letters abbreviation 
(http://www.iso.org/iso/en/prods-services/iso3166ma/02iso-3166-code-
lists/list-en1.html).       
     Finally, we assume that the database for the 15 EU countries satisfies the 
requirements of international comparison, i.e. characteristicity, base-country 
invariance,  transitivity,  additivity  and  commensurability.  The  role  of  the 
concrete aggregation method – by averaging of bilateral indices or by use of 
average  international  prices  –  is  discounted  in  some  extent  by  using  the 
relative variations of the investigated quantities.

3.1        The  mean  statistical distance  between  EU  countries  in 
various time window sizes 
 
GDP/capita data is first investigated with a fixed T = 10 years moving time 
window  size,  and  the  statistical  distance  matrix  D  thereby  constructed, 
taking into account N = 15 countries, namely AUT, BEL, DEU, DNK, ESP, 
FIN,  FRA,  GBR,  GRC,  IRL,  ITA,  LUX,  NLD,  PRT  and  SWE.  The  mean 
distance  between  the  countries  <d>  is  calculated  by  averaging  all  the

is the standard deviation of the dataset. 
     In  Figure  1  the  reduced  mean  statistical  distance  is  plotted  taking  into 
account  all  15  EU-countries,  between  1972  and  2004,  by  moving  the  10 
years time window by a year time step. For simplicity, the interval notation 
is abbreviated at the last two digits of the first and last year of the window, 
and each data point is arbitrarily centered in the middle of the interval.  
     The  time  evolution  of 
  sets  off  a  succession  of  abrupt  increases 
(“shocks”)  followed  by  decreases  (“relaxations”).  Such  phenomenon, 
occurred  in  the  time  interval  1986-2004,  is  separately  plotted  in  Figure  2. 
The variable x of the fit function (in the inset) represents the order number 
~
< d
of  the  point.  The  time  variation  of 
  displays  an  unexpected  abrupt 
jump when going from 1991-2000 to 1992-2001, followed by a decay well 
fitted  by  an  exponential  (see  inset).  If  the  exponential  decay  is  written 
, then τ is the so called “relaxation time” of the 
as:

process.  Here  it  is  about  12.5  years.  The  abrupt  jump  of

together with some similar anomaly in other statistical properties of the {dij} 
datasets, as the variance, kurtosis and skewness (see Figure 3).  Suspecting 
an effect due to Germany reunification, the data has been reanalyzed and is 
also shown on the same figure, but for only 14 countries (removing DEU – 
Figure 2), - but the anomalies remain.  
     In the next step of investigation, the second branch, i.e. the time interval 
1994-2004,  is  scanned  with  a  shorter  5  years  moving  time  window.  A 
monotonic  decreasing  trend  is  again  easily  noticeable  in  Figure  4, 
corresponding to a relaxation time of the same order of magnitude, i.e., τ ∼ 
8-10 years. 
     In  view  of  this  time  window  effect,  it  seems  reasonable  to  study  the 
statistical  distances  between  countries  using  GDP,  FCE  and  GCF  annual 
growth rates for the same (short) 5 years moving time window, for the data 
taken from 1994 to 2004*. It is seen that the reduced mean distance among 
the  EU-15  countries,  as  plotted  in  Figure  5,  follows  the  same  decreasing 
trend as in Figure 4 for the GDP/capita, indicating a remarkable degree of 
similarity  between  the  after-shock  responses  of  the  system  with  respect  to 
GDP and GCF fluctuations (the same relaxation time τ ∼ 8-10 years is found 
as in the case of GDP/capita). The relaxation time is τ  > 10 years for FCE 
fluctuations. We recall here that the term “fluctuations” refers, as above, to 
the annual rates of growth of the considered indicators (see data in insets).

3.2 Country clustering structure along the MAMLP method 
 
At this point of our investigation the subsequent ingredients of the MAMLP 
method,  introduced  in  Sect.  2,  are  implemented.  The  first  indicator  taken 
into  consideration  is  the  GDP  annual  growth.  A  virtual  ‘AVERAGE’ 
country is introduced in the system. The statistical distances corresponding 
to the fixed 5 years moving time window are set in increasing order and the 
minimal  length  path  (MPL)  connections  to  the  AVERAGE  are  established 
for each country in every time interval (Table 1a). The resulting hierarchy is 
found  to  be  changing  from  a  time  interval  to  another.  Therefore,  another 
correlation  matrix  is  built,  this  time  for  the  country  movements  inside  the 
hierarchy (Table 1b)*. The matrix elements are defined as:

where

are  the  minimal  length  path  (MPL)  distances  to  the 

AVERAGE.  For  simplicity,  in  Eq.  (3.4)  are  not  included  the  explicit 
dependencies on the time window size T.  
     In this way the strongest correlations and anti-correlations between GDP 
fluctuations  could  be  extracted  and  a  clustering  structure  searched  for.  We 
consider  that  some  correlations  (and  anticorrelations)  are  more  significant 
than  others,  as  indicated  in  bold  faces,  e.g.  we  consider  that  two  countries 
are  strongly  tied  if:  0.9  ≤  C  ≤  1  or  −  1  ≤  C  ≤  −  0.5  respectively  (both 
intervals enclose about 10% of the total number of the matrix elements). In 
this  sense,  a  schematic  representation  of  the  most  significant  correlations 
and anti-correlations taken out from Table 1b can be displayed (Figure 6).

     In  the  above  tables  we  can  observe  the  position  of  the  bold  elements, 
whence see that five of the mostly correlated countries with respect to GDP 
fluctuations (SWE-GBR-DEU-BEL-IRL) also display strong correlations in 
the  Final  Consumption  Expenditure  and  medium  correlations  in  Gross 
Capital  Formation  fluctuations  (Cij  ∼  0.8).  Moreover,  some  of  them  are 
strongly anticorrelated in Net Exports fluctuations (e.g. Cij < −0.9 for DEU-
SWE and DEU-IRL). The top strong correlations appear in FCE fluctuations 
(Table 2b), while the top anticorrelations can be found in NEX fluctuations 
(Table 4b).   
     Finally, we calculate a so called sensitivity degree, i.e., the quadratic sum 
of all the correlation coefficients:

4    Conclusion 
 
Analyzing  the  time  evolution  of  the  mean  statistical  distance  between  the 
EU-15 countries one expects to find a decreasing trend, when one expects a 
so called economy globalization. For the 10 years moving time window size 
(Figures 1 and 3) one can see a decreasing trend between 1979 and 1992 and 
for  the  last  4  time  intervals,  i.e.,  the  period  1992-2004,  when  the  mean 
distance decreases from 4.80 to 3.20 and from 4.09 to 3.06 respectively (in 
m/σ units, where m = the mean and σ = the standard deviation). In return, 
taking  into  account  the  whole  evolution,  the  phenomenon  appears  as 
strongly nonlinear and non-monotonic. A somewhat unexpected evolution is 
registered  in  1991-2000  and  1992-2001,  when  the  mean  distance  abruptly 
increases (in a single step) from 3.26 to 4.09. It is not only a change of value 
but also a change of trend (Figure 2), i.e., from a quasi-constant trend (or a 
slow linear decrease) to another one that is strongly decreasing well fitted to 
an exponential. The abrupt change of trend also occurred for other statistical 
parameters  of  the  distance  distributions,  e.g.  the  variance,  kurtosis  and 
skewness (Figure 3), approximately in the same time interval or in the next 
one.  
     The  first  explanation  one  could  imagine  would  be  the  Berlin  Wall  fall 
and Germany re-unification. Indeed, Germany was taken into consideration 

 

 

in the previous estimation of the mean distance and by far, it was having the 
most abrupt variation of economic parameters in that period (see e.g. Keller, 
1997).  But  the  phenomenon  seems  to  be  somewhat  more  complex.  In 
Figures  1a  and  1b  it  has  been  seen  that  the  time  variation  of  the  mean 
distance  between  countries  with  or  without  Germany  (and  its  connections)   
(the EU-14 plot), is not at all affected.    
     Another  explanation  might  be  found  when  analyzing  several  other 
important  events  which  occurred  after  the  Berlin  wall  fall i.e.  the  political 
changes  and  opening  of  new  markets  in  Eastern  Europe  and  Central  Asia, 
while  the  Western  European  countries  and  their  investors  were  having 
different positions in relation with these new possibilities of investment. In 
physical terms one can say that there was an increase in ‘physical volume or 
available space for the economic gas’ or, in other words a diffusion process 
as  described  in  ACP  model  (Ausloos  et  al.,  2004),  which  generated  an 
abrupt increase of  the  mean distance between countries. It is interesting to 
note that in physical models these nonequilibrium abrupt transitions, due to 
‘’shocks”, are generally followed by exponential or power law relaxations, 
(Lambiotte and Ausloos, 2006; Sornette et al., 2004).      
     As results from the above considerations, in large time windows (e.g. 10 
years or more) some successive increase and decrease of the mean statistical 
distance arise, so that the globalization trend appears to be non-monotonic. 
This aspect is somewhat expected, taking into account the large variations in 
the economic/social/political environment. 
     On  the  contrary,  when  a  5  years  time  window  size  is  moved  over  the 
interval 1994-2004, there is a clear decrease of the mean statistical distance 
between EU-15 countries from 3.20 to 1.89 as concerns GDP/capita (Figure 
4), from 2.86 to 1.81 for GDP, from 2.91 to 1.68 for the Final Consumption 
and from 3.01 to 1.49 for the Capital Growth (Figure 5). The mean distance 
does not display a clear trend as regards Net Exports fluctuations – at least 
in this time window size. 
     Regarding  the  country  clusters,  as  in  other  classification  problems,  a 
major  issue  that  arises  when  the  classification  trees  derive  from  real  data 
with  much  random  noise  concerns  how  to  define  what  a  cluster  is.    This 
general  issue  is  discussed  in  the  literature  on  tree  classification  under  the 
topic of overfitting (Breiman et al., 1984) If not stopped, the tree algorithm 
will ultimately “extract” all information from the data, including random or 
noise variation.  
     To  avoid  this  trap, in  our  classification  we  have  considered  as  “strong” 
correlations  and  anti-correlations  those  with  C  ≥  0.9  and  C  ≤  -  0.5 
respectively,  taking  into  account  that  the  both  intervals  of  C  include  the 
same  percentage  (∼  10  %)  from  the  total  set  of  correlation  coefficients. 
From  this  criterion,  the  strongly  correlated  countries  in  GDP  fluctuations 
(Table  1b  and  Figure  6)  can  be  partitioned  into  two  clusters:  FRA-SWE-
DEU and BEL-GBR-IRE-DNK-PRT. ITA can be considered in the second 
cluster  for  its  strong  correlation  with  GBR,  but  it  does  not  display  any 
strong correlations with the other countries. LUX is weakly correlated to the 

 

 

second  cluster,  while  AUT  is  somewhat  “equidistant”  displaying  medium 
correlations  with  both  clusters.  GRC  holds  a  special  position:  its  GDP 
fluctuations appear to be strongly anti-correlated with of all other countries.  
     The sum of squares of the correlation coefficients (Table 5) measures the 
country  so  called  “sensitivity  degree”.  The  most  sensitive  countries  to  the 
GDP  fluctuations  of  others  seem  to  be  DNK,  PRT,  DEU,  SWE  and  IRL. 
The  least  “sensitive”  ones  are  NLD,  ESP  and  FIN.  Geographically  closed 
pairs  of  countries  (FIN-DNK,  ESP-PRT  and  NLD-DEU)  are  situated  at 
opposite ends of this classification. We stress as an original finding that the 
sensitivity degree is not necessary related to the geographical position, and 
thus to the most probable trade exchanges. 
     The  strongest  correlations  of  GDP  fluctuations  can  be  recovered  only 
among  the  strongest  correlations  of  the  Final  Consumption  index.  Five  of 
the mostly correlated countries in GDP fluctuations (SWE-GBR-DEU-BEL-
IRL)  appear  as  such  (Table  1b),  due  their  strong  correlation  in  the  Final 
Consumption fluctuations (Table 2b). They display medium correlations in 
Gross Capital Formation fluctuations (Cij ∼ 0.8) and some of them are even 
strongly anticorrelated in Net Exports fluctuations (e.g. Cij < −0.9 for DEU-
SWE  and  DEU-IRL).  On  the  other  hand,  one  can  note  that  the  sensitivity 
classifications regarding GDP and Net Exports fluctuations are quite similar 
(Table 5), at least for the countries situated at the top and at the bottom. We 
recover  here  one  of  the  main  characteristics  of  social  networks  that  is  the 
positive  correlation  existing  between  the  node  degrees  (Ramasco  et  al., 
2003),  i.e.  the  high  connected  countries  commonly  tend  to  connect  with 
other well connected ones. So, a true proof of globalization is found. 
     Finally, we recall that the above classifications and clusters refer only to 
the  fluctuations  of  investigated  quantities,  without  consideration  of  their 
actual  value.  It  requires  some  further  work  to  observe  whether  our  results 
are carried over to other correlation-hierarchical clustering of EU countries 
in other situations.

Appendix:    Shuffled data analysis 
 
For  a  robustness  test  and  statistical  error  bar  significance,  the  elements  of 
the  statistical  distance  matrices  were  shuffled  per  columns  so  as  the  data 
proceeded  from  different  time  windows  were  randomly  mixed.  The  mean 
statistical  distances  so  constructed  are  plotted  in  figures  7a  (for  GDP),  7b 
(for FCE) and 7c (for GCF). For comparison, the true data and their best fit 
are shown as well.  
     In all three index cases so considered, the mean distance derived from the 
shuffled  data  midly  oscillates  around  a  constant  value,  as  it  has  to  be 
expected;  the  amplitude  of    the  fluctuations  is  0.49  units  mean/sigma  for 
GDP, 0.12 units for FCE and 0.28 units for GCF, that means 35 %, 9.7 %, 
and 21.5 % respectively from their maximal (real) variation induced by the 
decreasing trend.

     As  a  second  test,  the correlation matrix from Table 1b was randomized 
by  shuffling  MLP  distances  to  AVERAGE  (from  Table  1a),  firstly  per 
columns  and  secondly  per  lines.  The  results  are  presented  in  Table  6.  The 
maximum and minimum values of the correlation coefficients are found to 
be (Cmax)shufll = 0.71 and (Cmin)shufll = − 0.68 as compared with (Cmax) = 0.99 
and (Cmin) = − 0.80 from Table 1b. According to the criterion discussed in 
Section  5  (Ccorr  ≥  0.9  and  Canticorr  ≤   −   0.8),  one  can  say  that  neither  any 
strong  correlations  nor  anti-correlation  appear.  In  other  words,  the 
correlations  which  resulted  in  the  clustering  structure  from  Figure  6  are 
destroyed by the randomization, consequently giving weight to the main text 
results, analysis and conclusion.

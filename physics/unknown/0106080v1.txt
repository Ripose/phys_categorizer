Massless electrodynamics in the zero-point field:  

equilibrium spectral energy distribution and the origin of inertia. 

Abstract 

Attempts at an electromagnetic explanation of mass of charged particles have recently been revived 

within  the  framework  of  Stochastic  Electrodynamics,  characterized  by  the  adoption  of  a  classical 

version  of  the  EM  ZPF.  The  focus  of  this  paper  is  on  the  novel  behavior  in  the  ZPF  of  the  bare 

massless charge sources employed in those efforts. It is found that a single massless charge produces 

a field of charge / anti-charge pairs with Lorentz-Invariant statistics. The spectrum of the secondary 

radiation field reproduces the ρ ~ ω3 spectral energy density of the ‘incident’ ZPF, in contrast to the 

Rayleigh-Jeans  distribution  normally  attributed  to  the  classical  vacuum  so  that,  to  first  order,  the 

classical field of charge / anti-charge pairs and classical analogue of the EM ZPF are self-consistent. 

To  the  degree  that  the  EM  field  remains  the  canonical  ZPF,  it  is  deduced  that  a  massless  charge 

cannot  acquire  mass  from  nothing  as  a  result  of  immersion  in  the  field,  though  possibilities  for  a 

ZPF-inertia connection remain. 

1.  Background 

An  interesting  and  neglected  feature  of  classical  electrodynamics  (CED)  is  that  it  permits 

superluminal  speeds  and  time-reversals  of  massless  charges  [1],  which  properties  are  potentially 

significant for theories attempting to attribute inertia to electromagnetism, including recent efforts 

calling  upon  a  special  role  for  the  EM  ZPF  [2-8].  Independent  of  the  details,  if  the  ZPF-inertia 

program  is  successful,  inertial  mass  must  disappear  along  with  the  ZPF,  requiring  that  the 

traditional  –  ZPF-intransigent  -  mass-action  must  be  replaced  with  something  else  involving  EM 

interactions.  In  short,  that  program  is  founded  upon  a  massless  bare  charge,  and  will  therefore 

inherit the special features of massless CED.

To some degree the ZPF-inertia program is a development of work wherein classical representations 

of  the  ZPF  have  been  used  to  derive  a  variety  of  quantum  results.  These  include  van  der  Waals 

binding [9,10] the Casimir effect (see for example the calculation and associated comments in [11]), 

the  Davies-Unruh  effect  [12],  the  ground-state  behavior  of  the  quantum-mechanical  harmonic 

oscillator  [13],  and,  with  some  qualifications  (see  Sec.  5),  the  blackbody  spectrum  [14-17].  More 

broadly,  besides  the  hypothesized  ZPF-inertia  connection,  these  successes  have  encouraged  a 

‘realistic’ classical interpretation of the EM ZPF [18-22], though the original idea of a classical ZPF 

seems to date back to Nernst [23]. 

In  its  role  as  the  originator  of  inertia,  the  ZPF  has  been  envisioned  as  an  external,  energizing 

influence for a local internal degree of freedom intrinsic to the particle whose mass is to be explained. 

The program has some of the flavor of Mach in that the ZPF provides a ‘background’ against which 

the acceleration can be measured. It has been assumed that the local dynamical degree of freedom is 

the  amplitude  of  an  oscillator  whose  initially  quiescent  state  has  no  intrinsic  energy  [2,3]. 

Subsequently,  when  the  ZPF  is  ‘switched  on’,  the  oscillator  is  energized,  and  the  ZPF-originated 

energy  associated  with  the  oscillator  can  be  regarded  as  its  ‘rest’  mass.  In  other  work,  the  local 

properties  that  ultimately  determine  the  mass  of  the  charged  particle  enter  somewhat  less 

specifically as a cutoff of the spectral response of the particle to the ZPF [4,5,6]. These two models are 

the subject of some discussion in Sec. 6.  

In  these  ZPF-inertia  studies,  the  electrodynamics  of  the  charge  in  its  pre-mass  condition  has  not 

hitherto  received  attention.  Perhaps  the  omission  is  tacitly  justified  on  the  grounds  that  the  ZPF-

energization will ‘quickly’ render the particle massive, so the ‘intermediate’ state of masslessness is 

of  no  import.  In  an  effort  to  test  the  validity  of  that  implicit  assumption,  this  paper  analyzes  the 

motion  of  a  massless  classical  charge  in  the  EM  ZPF,  classically  represented.  Section  0  briefly 

discusses  possible  paths  towards  higher  order  approximations.  In  the  light  of  the  behavior  of  the 

 

2 

 

 

 
 
 

massless  charge,  in  Sec.  6  we  take  the  opportunity  to  evaluate  recent  theories  of  inertia  from  the 

ZPF, and identify promising paths for further development. 

It turns out that the secondary radiation field spectrum of a classical massless charge reproduces the 

ZPF spectrum, suggesting that the ZPF may be viewed as a self-consistent classical vacuum field, in 

contrast to the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum at or near T = 0. This issue is discussed in detail in Sec. 5, 

along with an examination of claims by other workers that this equilibrium is maintained by massive 

charges  [14-17],  which  is  in  contrast  with  the  traditional  view  as  reported  by  Van  Vleck  [24]  that 

regular massive classical electrodynamics is incompatible with an electromagnetic noise field having 

the ZPF spectrum. 

2.  Behavior of massless charges 

No self-action 

A literal interpretation of the mathematics leads one to believe that the observed mass of charges is 

the result of an almost exact cancellation between an infinite electromagnetic part (as a result of self 

action) and an infinite non-electromagnetic part. Obviously the non-electromagnetic part must go in 

a program whose aim is a purely electromagnetic description of mass. Therefore the electromagnetic 

part  must  either  go  too,  or  must  somehow  be  rendered  finite.  The  latter  option  leads  to  a 

mathematically consistent picture [25], which is, however, at odds with the data: the finite structures 

demanded  are  not  observed.  By  contrast,  the  more  recent  ZPF-motivated  efforts  exercise  the  first 

option  by  not  appealing  to  self-action.  But  then,  since  radiation  reaction  -  as  it  appears  in  the 

Lorentz-Dirac equation (and the corresponding Heisenberg equation of motion [26]) - is a form of self-

action, it too must go. Radiation reaction may yet return, as in the direct action program of Wheeler 

and  Feynman  [27,28].  But  there,  accepting  the  reality  of  advanced  and  retarded  potentials,  it  is  a 

consequence  of  particular  boundary  conditions  at  infinity  whose  effects  are  visited  upon  a  charged 

particle,  whose  mass  has  been  already  ‘established’.  It  follows  that  regardless  of  whether  the 

radiation reaction is of the traditional self-action or Wheeler-Feynman variety, it should be banished 

 

3 

 

 

 
 
 

from an analysis of a massless charged particle. But if there is no reaction from the radiation back 

upon  the  source,  it  then  follows  from  energy  and  momentum  conservation  that  the  secondary 

radiation emitted by a massless charged particle can carry neither intrinsic energy nor momentum. 

This additional requirement forces us to choose in favor of the direct action program of Wheeler and 

Feynman,  which  simultaneously  confers  the  attributes:  no  Coulomb  self-energy,  no  radiation 

reaction, and no radiation energy and momentum.  

Equation of motion 

It is shown in [1] that the motion of a massless charge in an EM field is uniquely determined by the 

prescription that it avoid the Lorentz force. In so doing, the particle can undergo time-reversals, and 

therefore its trajectory must be by parameterized by a quantity, λ say, that will not, in general, be 

time-monotonic. Accordingly, the trajectory is

the  trajectory,  though  the  choice  of  gauge  will  play  no  role  in  the  following  discussions.  That  ψ  is 

independent of time in source free regions is easily demonstrated by differentiation with respect to 

time, and then using the Maxwell relations. 

Eq. (1) must be supplemented by a constraint on the initial condition (at some λ) that the particle be 

placed in a location where ψ is zero, which is the well-known prerequisite to be satisfied by the fields 

that  there  exist  some  velocity  for  which  the  Lorentz-force  can  be  made  to  vanish.  To  see  this,  and 

demonstrate that the Lorentz-force will then vanish, we note that the latter is

which is indeed zero if ψ is zero. The set of points so defined generates a (nodal) surface. Noting that 

the space part of the 4-velocity is normal to this surface, it follows that a particle placed upon it will 

remain  confined  to  it  thereafter.  This  guarantees  that  the  Lorentz  force  will  remain  zero.  (Things 

will get more complicated if  ψ∇ were to vanish simultaneously with ψ, but in this work these points 

will  be  neglected  on  the  grounds  that  the  stochastic  nature  of  the  ZPF  will  ensure  that  they  will 

always form a set of zero measure compared to the nodal surface.) 

The following properties of the motion are fairly obvious, but nonetheless worthy of emphasis: 

The massless charge cannot absorb power from the fields.  

As  a  result  of  its  motion,  the  particle  generates  its  own  secondary  fields  as  determined  by  the 

usual EM formulae. By taking the scalar product of Eq. (1) with

from  which  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  massless  charge  cannot  absorb  power  from  the  fields,

these events occur in (oppositely charged) pairs as entry and exit paths to and from the turning 

points. 

3.  Motion in the ZPF 

Background 

We  now  pre-specify  an  EM  field,  which,  at  least  in  theory,  may  be  regarded  as  the  first  step in an 

iterative  procedure  culminating  in  a  set  of  self-consistent  charge  and  radiation  fields.  Consistent 

with the classical framework of this document and recent attempts to establish a connection between 

the  ZPF  and  inertia,  we  will  adopt  a  classical  analogue  of  the  ZPF  as  described  in  [13].  To  each 

classical free-space EM mode is attributed an expected field energy of  ω"½

 - but the field amplitudes 

and  phase  are  otherwise  (classical)  random  variables  with  distributions  chosen  to  reproduce  QFT 

expectations. The outcome is a classical EM noise field with the same Lorentz-invariant ω3 spectral 

energy distribution as that of the ZPF of QFT. As pointed out in Sec. 1, in order to be consistent with 

the  presumed  initial  state  of  masslessness,  the  Wheeler-Feynman  EM  driving  fields  contain  no 

energy  of  their  own.  Since  this  is  a  property  of  the  correct  EM  Hamiltonian  in  which  the  ZPF 

partakes, not of the ZPF itself, the statistics of the field remain unaffected by adopting this stance. 

And since the net effect is only to subtract out the constant infinite energy, the ZPF so conceived will 

reproduce all the familiar effects - Lamb shift, Casimir effect, etc., yet without the violence inflicted 

upon GR by an infinite energy density.

symmetrized over the order.)

Since E and B are isotropically distributed independent random variables, the angle between them is 

random and uniformly distributed in [0,2π]. This is true for the pair E(x,t), B(x,t), and it is also true 

for the pair

4.  Some properties of the motion in the ZPF 

 

Charge 

Suppose  now  that  a  single  trajectory  is  driven  by  the  noise  field  described  in  the  previous  section. 

With  reference  to  Eq. (1),  it  is  clear  that  the  statistics  of  the  increments  in  space  and  time  are 

independent  of  location (in space and time) because the fields are statistically stationary, isotropic, 

and  homogeneous.  Taking  into  account  time  reversals,  the  trajectory  gives  rise  to  a  constant, 

isotropic, and homogeneous distribution for the ‘occupancy’ of time and space. It follows that the net 

average charge at every location is zero. The same is true for the average spatial displacement: at all 

times the expected current is everywhere zero. Strictly, the distribution of charge is not delta-valued 

at zero, since any number of forward and backward pieces of the trajectory can overlap at any point – 

they  need  not  exactly  balance.  However,  the  coherence  length  of  the  trajectory,  i.e.,  the  space 

interval  over  which  autocorrelation  speed  is  maintained,  can  be  no  longer  than  the  shortest 

wavelength in the ZPF, which distance is vanishingly small. That is, the model, as it stands, predicts 

charge fluctuations on the scale of the ZPF cutoff wavelength, this being the only length scale that 

could  possibly  enter  into  the  theory.  Since  practical  measurements  (interactions)  of  charge  involve 

instruments of finite resolution, it follows that they will always effectively perform a perfect average, 

and  the  fluctuations  are  unobservable.  Such  measurements  therefore  must  return  the  value  0, 

despite  the  fact  that  the  underlying  trajectory  undergoes  time  reversals.  From  this  it  must  be 

concluded that any observation of non-zero point charge must be regarded as evidence of a departure 

from the ‘baseline’ (zero-point) state of affairs because, in the case of the latter, any charge initially 

supposed to exist at a point, before assertion of the ZPF, becomes smeared out over all space.

and  the  distributions  p(E)  and  p(B)  are  normal  with  zero  mean  and variance given by Eq. (7). The 

delta function enforces the orthogonality constraint in a plausible – though admittedly not unique - 

way. The eight integrals in Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) can be performed (involving some algebra) to give

. On average then, the RMS speed of a massless charge in the ZPF is the speed of 

light.  The  distribution  of  speeds  is  not  delta-valued  (at  c),  since both subluminal and superluminal 

speeds  must  be  present,  as  discussed  earlier.  However,  just  as  for  the  charge,  the  near-vanishing 

coherence length of the trajectory guarantees that practical measurements involving instruments of 

finite resolution must effectively perform a perfect average. Consequently, supposing there exists an 

instrument that measures speed (and not velocity), such will always return the value 1 for the speed, 

despite the fact that the underlying trajectory has a distribution of speeds.  

Invariance of the statistics from the equation of motion 

Taking  the  homogeneity  and  isotropy  of  the  statistics  as  more-or-less  self-evident,  it  remains  to 

investigate how the trajectory transforms under boosts. Accordingly, let us apply a boost

µΛ  to the 

particle and compare its motion  uµ  to that of its un-boosted ancestor  uµ . Recalling that any Lorentz

are the tensor and the vector parts of the new equation. The transformation of ψ follows because it is 

independent of velocity except for Lorentz contraction of the coordinates.  

In  order  to  ascertain  the  invariance  or  otherwise  of  the  equation  of  motion,  it  is  at  the  same  time 

necessary to be more explicit about the circumstances under which the potentials and the field may 

be differentiated – whereupon the dual  F!  of the field strength tensor, and the 4-vector,  νψ∂

, may be 

computed from the potentials. Consider the two possibilities:  

I.  The  particle  responds to frequencies no greater than some finite but very large frequency ωp. 

The  ZPF  has  no  cutoff,  or,  it  has  a  cutoff  at  a frequency much greater than ωp (great enough 

that the ZPF cutoff cannot, by any conceivable motion, be red-shifted to a frequency below ωp). 

II.  The particle responds to all frequencies, but ‘observations’ are band-limited to ωp. The ZPF has 

a cutoff at a frequency much greater than ωp. 

In both these cases, the potentials can be differentiated and the statistical isotropy and homogeneity 

of the potentials will be frame independent, because the effective bandwidth of the EM noise (ωp) is 

frame  independent. The boosted particle does see a different ZPF from the un-boosted particle, but 

only in the sense of a different sample from the same distribution. It follows that, given either of the 

two possibilities above, the statistics of the boosted and un-boosted particles are the same. (Strictly, 

by itself, this is not sufficient to guarantee that the Lorentz contraction of the coordinates in Eq. (14) 

is unobservable. This is because the elementary random variables – the coefficients 

, pak

 in Eq. (4) – 

could  in  principle  be  deduced  from  successive  measurements,  whereupon  motion  could  be  inferred 

against  the  background.  However,  this  possibility  is  technically  infeasible  given  the  innumerable 

degrees of freedom in the ZPF. And it is strictly impossible in the limit that the ZPF has no cutoff as 

in case I.) Consequently the Lorentz contraction of the coordinates in Eq. (14) is unobservable, and it 

is concluded that the stochastic equation of motion of the particle is independent of the velocity of the 

frame in which it is observed. This property is not exclusive to Eq. (1). It belongs to any equation of 

 

11 

 

 

 
 
 

motion that remains form-invariant under Lorentz transformations, and in which the driving fields 

are the ZPF, including, for example, the Lorentz-Dirac equation. The latter case, which dates back to 

the  early  days  of  Stochastic  Electrodynamics  [30,31,32],  is  the  relativistic  version  of  the  Braffort-

Marshall equation

where F is the field tensor of the ZPF. This full invariance is seen to rest upon the unobservability of 

any  Lorentz-contraction  of  the  driving  fields,  the  latter  being  a  property  exclusive  to  the  ZPF  in 

conjunction with either of the above enumerated possibilities involving derivatives. 

Self-interaction 

Though  electromagnetic  spectral  self-consistency  has  been  established  as  a  possibility  for  massless 

‘electrodynamics’,  all  the  previous  analysis  is  valid  only  at  the  level  of  the  first  iteration  of  the 

particle-field interaction, wherein the EM field is just the ZPF, as characterized in Eqs. (4) and (5). 

But at the next iteration that assumption should be revised and refined. A particle undergoing time 

reversals  will  cross  its  own  light  cone,  and  at  those  points  it  will  feel  its  own  retarded,  and  –  if 

applicable  –  advanced,  radiation  field,  which  influences  have  hitherto  been  ignored.  From  the 

standpoint of a single trajectory parameterized by λ, such a particle may be said to experience self-

interaction. Alternatively, if the trajectory is segmented into alternating-signed charges, these light-

cone crossing events may be deemed to occur between different particles. In either case, the theory 

should  acknowledge  this  web  of  interactivity  at  the  next  level  of  sophistication.  The  situation  is 

reminiscent of QFT after the matter-field coupling has been switched on. To make further progress, 

one  expects  to  have  to  deal  with  various  infinities  in  a  similar  fashion,  distinguishing  between 

observed and bare quantities.

Summary 

Classical  electrodynamics  is  found  to  predict  a  homogeneous  field  of  charge  from  a  single massless 

source  immersed  in  a  Lorentz-Invariant  field.  The  field  contains  charged  pairs  but  the  expected 

value of charge is zero. The observed value of the speed is expected to be the speed of light, though 

subluminal  and  superluminal  speeds  are  present  at  an  unobservable  resolution.  Under  reasonable 

assumptions,  all  statistics  of  the  trajectory  are  Lorentz-Invariant.  There  is  some  suggestion  of  a 

connection with Dirac theory, at least insofar as the expected charge and speed agree with that of the 

QED  vacuum  and  isolated  quantum,  respectively.  However,  Compton-style  vacuum  fluctuations  do 

not appear until the ZPF cutoff is approached, so it must be concluded that the theory – if it has any 

validity – describes a pre-mass, pre-Compton fluctuation, substratum. 

5.  On the classical equilibrium spectrum of electromagnetism  

Spectrum due to massless charges 

The  general  result  of  the  previous  section  that  the  equation  of  motion  is  frame-independent 

establishes that the secondary radiation emitted by the charge must likewise be frame independent. 

This  is  enough  to  guarantee  that  the  emission  spectrum  matches  the  canonical  ZPF  (up  to  a 

multiplicative  constant),  whereupon  the  kµ-space  distribution  of  the  ZPF  fields  is  self-reproducing, 

validating  the  original  proposed  incident  fields.  Though  self-consistent,  it  would  be  misleading  to 

claim that the assumed spectrum of the in-fields is in equilibrium with the charge, because there is 

no room for dynamic evolution (in t time) of the spectra in this bare-bones model; it is simply a self-

consistent state of affairs, existing in perpetuity. Nonetheless, this radical result might conceivably 

be considered as a challenge to one of the motivations for abandonment of classical mechanics.  

The spectrum due to massive charges 

It was pointed out in the previous section that any form-invariant equation, including the Lorentz-

Dirac  equation  for  a  massive  charge,  gives  a  fully  invariant  (i.e.,  in  the  sense  of  a  Lorentz  scalar), 

velocity-independent,  stochastic  equation  of  motion  if  the  driving  field  is  the  ZPF,  including 

 

13 

 

 

 
 
 

therefore,  the  Braffort-Marshall  equation.  (The  same,  of  course,  would  be  true  if  the  radiation 

reaction terms were dropped from that equation to give just the relativistic Newton-Lorentz equation 

of  motion.)  It  would  seem  to  follow  that  all  the  statistics  of  the  Lorentz-Dirac  charged  particle, 

including that of the secondary radiation, should be independent of its inertial frame, and therefore 

that  massive  -  not  just  massless  -  classical  charged  particles  and  the  ZPF  can  be  mutually  self-

consistent.  Though  permitted,  this  possibility  can  be  discounted  by  appeal  to  observation:  If  an 

equilibrium configuration involving the ZPF is viewed from a moving frame, the ZPF spectrum would 

be  unchanged,  implying  the  new  (Lorentz-transformed)  matter  distribution  must  also  be  in 

equilibrium.  Since  this  must  be  true  for  any  boost,  the  matter  distribution  must  be  Lorentz-

Invariant. However, we observe that we do not live in a universe where the matter is distributed in a 

Lorentz-Invariant fashion. On the contrary, the velocity distribution of matter is such as to provide a 

locally  identifiable  absolute  cosmic  reference  frame.  We  can  conclude  that  the  matter  we  observe 

cannot be in equilibrium with the ZPF, classically interpreted. This velocity-independence symmetry 

of  the  ZPF  radiation  field  therefore  imposes  a  tight  constraint  on  the  candidate  equilibrium 

distributions  of  the  sources  which  does  not  exist  in  the  relation  between  the  Rayleigh-Jeans  (RJ) 

radiation  spectrum, 

ρ ω∝

2T

,  and  the  Maxwell-Boltzmann  (MB)  matter  distribution  at  finite 

temperature  [24].  The  latter  relation  is  analyzed  in  only  a  single  frame  in  which  a  particular  RJ 

distribution  will  be  in  equilibrium  with  a  particular  MB  distribution  if  they  have  the  same 

temperature. From a moving frame the same situation would look quite different: the EM spectrum 

would  no  longer  be  an  RJ  spectrum,  and  the  MB  distribution  would  acquire  a  net  drift  /  offset 

velocity.  Except  in  the  trivial  case  at  absolute  zero,  the  two  need  not  be,  and  would  not  be,  in 

equilibrium with each other, or amongst themselves. 

Relation to earlier work 

Boyer  [14,15]  has  published  a  derivation  of  the  (QM)  blackbody  spectrum  from  the  Stochastic 

Electrodynamics  of  massive  particles  assuming  the  existence  of  a  classical  zero-point  field  with  its 

 

14 

 

 
 
 

attendant  ω3  spectrum.  The  latter  assumption  is  justified  therein  simply  on  the  basis  of  Lorentz 

invariance of the EM radiation rather than equilibrium between radiation and matter. Boyer’s claim 

does  not  contradict  the  conclusions  reached  above  because  he  does  not  claim  electromagnetic  self-

consistency. Subsequently, Boyer examined the exchange between a nonrelativistic nonlinear dipole 

oscillator and a background EM field [33] to see if the ω3 spectrum of the latter can in fact be derived 

on the basis of classical equilibrium1. Boyer’s conclusion concurs with the accepted view [24] that the 

Rayleigh-Jeans and not the ZPF spectrum is the equilibrium spectrum, supporting the conclusions of 

the discussion above. His work was repeated and the conclusion confirmed by Pesquera and Claverie 

[34],  and  again  by  Blanco,  Pesquera,  and  Santos  [35].  (Blanco  and  Pesquera  subsequently  drew 

attention to the interesting fact that these analyses, demonstrating equilibrium between a Rayleigh-

Jeans  radiation  spectrum,  and  Maxwell-Boltzmann  matter  distribution,  require  a  cutoff  in  the 

Rayleigh-Jeans  spectrum  [36].  However,  these  efforts  are  all  nonrelativistic;  it  is  possible  that  the 

problem will disappear if analyzed relativistically.) 

It is necessary to qualify the claim that the distribution of charges must be Lorentz-Invariant if they 

are to be in equilibrium with the ZPF. If the charges response to the in-fields is perfectly linear, they 

are incapable of modifying any distribution. Technically, any distribution of such linear charges (or 

oscillators) can be regarded in some sense as in equilibrium with any spectrum. Puthoff [37,38] has 

considered  massive  charges  as  possible  sources  of  the  ZPF  since,  in  the  non-relativistic  limit,  they 

have this property of linearity. Similarly, Cole [16,17] has considered massive non-relativistic dipoles 

for  the  same  job.  Practically  though,  such  arrangements  are  unstable,  since  nonlinearities  will  be 

present to some degree. Consequently massive charges will find themselves unable to reproduce the 

ZPF  (since  their  own  distribution  is  not  Lorentz-Invariant)  and  must  be  disqualified  as  source 

candidates. 

                                                      
1  In  an  expanding  universe,  equilibrium  between  a  classically  conceived  ZPF  and  massive  charges 
that do not time-reverse must be a fossil from the radiation-dominated era. Either that, or perhaps 
the ZPF contains both advanced and retarded potentials.

6.  Electromagnetic origin of inertia 

Massless, structureless particles in the ZPF 

 

With  reference  to  Eq. (3),  there  is  no  means  by  which  the  EM  noise  field  can  deliver  power  to  the 

trajectory. Therefore the charge cannot acquire energy from the ZPF (saturating, for instance, at the 

observed rest-mass value). In short, since there are no internal degrees of freedom, there is nowhere 

for  the  electron  to  put  the  energy.  From  this  can  be  concluded  that  an  independent,  structureless, 

massless,  point  charge  cannot  acquire  mass  as  a  result  of  immersion  in  the  ZPF.  I.E.  one  can 

immediately discount the possibility that a given ZPF (given in the sense of a pre-specified field) can 

alone explain inertia of such a particle. This is not to deny that mass may yet emerge from a process 

involving the ZPF – but it cannot be the whole story. 

This  conclusion  is  in  contrast  to  the  recent  works  by  Rueda  and  Haisch  who  argue  that  inertia  – 

specifically Newton’s 2nd Law - arises from scattering of the ZPF by a structureless charged particle 

[4,5,6].  Admittedly  this  conjecture  is  particularly  attractive  because  of  its  simplicity;  it  makes  no 

assumptions about hidden structure or hidden dipoles energized by the ZPF. Specifically, in [5], the 

authors  claim  to  have  derived  inertia  via  an  approach  “which  avoids  the  ad-hoc  particle-field 

interaction  model  (Planck  oscillator).”  (See  [7]  for  a  discussion  of  this  later  approach  of  Rueda  and 

Haisch  contrasted  with  their  earlier  ‘parton’  model  discussed  below.)  However,  in  the  light  of  the 

previous analysis, it can be seen that there is no way for a strictly massless structureless particle to 

acquire  mass  as  a  result  of  immersion  in  the  ZPF.  The  ZPF  cannot  energize  the  particle  because 

according to Eq. (3) it cannot deliver any power (at any time, not just in the mean). For the Rueda 

and Haisch program to work, there needs to be some extra ingredient. 

On ZPF-originated inertia of particles with structure 

In  earlier  works  by  Haisch,  Rueda,  and  Puthoff  [2],  and  by  Haisch  and  Rueda  [3],  the  charged 

particle  is  deemed  equipped  with  some  kind  of  internal,  oscillatory,  degree  of freedom (the ‘parton’ 

 

16 

 

 

 
 
 

model). Upon immersion in the ZPF, this (Planck) oscillator is energized, and the energy so acquired 

is some or all of its observed inertial mass. Such a particle is not a structureless point in the usual 

classical sense, and so does not suffer from an inability to respond to the ZPF, provided the proposed 

components (sub-electron charges) already carry inertia, at least as an assembled unit. If this were 

not the case, then the slightest EM influence experienced by dipole would tear it apart. Since mass 

must already be present before the localized degree of freedom can be activated, the ZPF would not 

be the sole originator of inertia, though it could conceivably boost an already present tiny localized 

mass-energy to an observable value. 

Inertia from nonlocal ZPF-mediated electromagnetic coupling? 

Some  of  the  obstacles  to  a  conclusively  successful  ZPF-motivated  theory  of  inertia  have  been 

highlighted above. To proceed, at higher orders of approximation than that presented here, one must 

somehow  explain  localization  of  mass-energy  in  terms  of  (previously)  homogeneous  and  incoherent 

fields,  perhaps  as  a  result  of  spontaneously  broken  symmetry.  If  such  a  program  were  ever  to  be 

successful,  it  is  conceivable  that  the  charged,  massive  and  time-asymmetric,  particle,  familiar  to 

canonical  physics,  will  emerge  from  a  coupled  collection  of  underlying  elemental  trajectories 

characteristic of the classical massless charge.

Abstract

Ab-initio  calculations reveal that   all-metal antiaromatic molecules like Al4M4  (M=Li, Na and K) can be stabilized in   half-sandwich
complex: (Al4M4)Fe(CO)3 and full-sandwich complexes of the type: (Al4M4)2Ni. The formation of the full-sandwich complex [(Al4M4)2Ni]
from its organometallic precursor depends on the stability of the organic-inorganic hybrid (C4H4) Ni (Al4Li4).

     The concept of aromaticity and antiaromaticity is of
fundamental importance to the structural chemistry.1-3 This
concept   has   been   recently   extended   from   the   organic
molecules to metallic systems like Al and Sn.4,5 Molecules
like Li4Al4, Na4Al4  and their anions (Li3Al4
-)
have   been   recently   shown   as   the   examples   of   first
antiaromatic metal clusters due to their close resemblence
with   C4H4,   from   both   structural   and   electronic   point   of
view.6  Also,   very   recently,   we   have   shown   that   these
clusters can be very well stabilized by complexation with
3d-metal   atoms   like   Fe   and   Ni   which   results   in
metalloaromaticity in these Al4-clusters with increase in the
number of ?-electrons from 4? to 6?.7 This is very similar
in   concept   to   the   onset   of   aromaticity   in   C4H4    on
complexation,   originally   proposed   by   H.   C.   Longuet
Higgins et al. and synthesized soon after by Criegee et al.8
The counterions in Al4M4 (M=Li, Na and K) being highly
electropositive,   lose   the   electrons   to   the   Al4,   thereby
making the ring formally (-4) and thus a 4?  antiaromatic
system. Al4M4 can thus be considered as isolobal with C4H4
and is expected to follow similar reactivity as shown for
C4H4.9 The role of the counterions have however, not been
investigated till now and in this work we critically examine
their   role   and   propose   the   methodologies   for   possible
experimental synthesis through stepwise formation of half-
sandwich   all-metal   complexes,   hybrid   organo-inorganic
complexes and finally full-sandwich all-metal complexes.
We   also   study   the   bonding   aspects   in   the   first   mixed
sandwich (hybrid) complexes of the type: (Al4M4)(C4H4)Ni.
Interestingly,   we   find   that   these   hybrid   sandwich
complexes have admixtured interactions with the transition
metal atoms and organic/inorganic ligands and can be the
candidates for future synthesis.

           The  structures  considered  for  the present  work:
(Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3, sandwich complexes of the type: (Al4M4)

2-Ni and the hybrid-sandwich complexes: (Al4M4)(C4H4)-Ni
with   M=Li,   Na   and   K,     were   optimized   based   on   the
B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)+   method   (see   supporting   information
file   for   details).10  The   calculations   for   the   fragmentation
energy   analysis   and   the   HOMO-LUMO   gaps   were
performed  at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)++  level. The same
level   of   calculations   were   also   performed   for   the
uncoordinated   Al4M4   and   C4H4.   We   first   discuss   the
structural   features   in   the   uncoordinated   ligands,   Al4M4.
There are some remarkable similarities in their structures
with variation  in  the alkali   metal  ions. The ground  state
minimum  energy  form  for  all   the ligands   possess  a  C2h
symmetry (See Fig. 1). 

Figure 1. Ground state geometry for Al4M4. Bond-distances d1 and d2
(in Å) are 2.68, 2.56 for Al4Li4, 2.70, 2.59 for Al4Na4 and 2.67, 2.58
for  Al4K4  respectively . See Supp.  information  file for  coordinates
and energies of these geometries.

Another   very   important   feature   to   be   noticed   for   these
molecules   is   that   the   ground   state   geometry   for   all   the
ligands   have   a   substantial   bond   length   alteration   (BLA)
[0.124   Å   for   Al4Li4,   0.11   Å   for   Al4Na4  and   0.10   Å   for
Al4K4].   BLA   is   defined   as   the   bond   length   difference
between two subsequent Al-Al bonds in the central four-
membered Al4 ring. For their organic analogue, C4H4 , the
BLA is 0.245 Å. While, the magnitude of BLA in these
clusters   are   smaller   than   that   for   the   ?-conjugated

antiaromatic   molecule,   C4H4,   it   is   more   than   that   in   the
aromatic molecules like benzene (BLA=0) and thus these
clusters are both ?-aromatic as well as ?-antiaromatic.6a,11
We have calculated the nucleus-independent chemical shift
(NICS)   at   the   GIAO-B3LYP/   6-311G(d,p)++   level   for
these molecules.11 The NICS values for Al4Li4, Al4Na4 and
Al4K4  are   –11.55   ppm,   -7.91   ppm   and   –7.72   ppm
respectively. Interestingly, with variation in the size of the
alkali metal, we find that the extent of NICS aromaticity
decreases with the increase in the size of the counterion.
This   is   understood   from   the   fact   that   the   ionization
potentials in M decreases in the order, Li > Na> K. Thus,
the extent of charge transfer is maximum in Al4K4 from the
K ion to the Al4 ring and is strongly ?-antiaromatic which
reduces   the   magnitude   of   the   ?-aromaticity.   A   similar
conclusion   is   also   derived   by   the   magnitudes   in   the
HOMO-LUMO   gaps.   The   gaps   for   Al4Li4,   Al4Na4  and
Al4K4 are 1.45 eV, 1.25 eV and 0.74 eV respectively. The
much   smaller   gap   for   Al4K4  signifies   high   reactivity,
smaller   chemical   hardness   and   poor   overall   aromatic
character.13 

         In the complex (Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3  , in all the cases
with variation in M, the ligand binds strongly with the Fe
atom   forming   an   ?4  coordination.   A   very   remarkable
feature   in   these   complexes   is   that   in   the   Al4
4-  rings,   the
BLA  is   very   small   [0.028  Å,   0.0345  Å  and   0.041  Å  in
(Al4Li4)Fe(CO)3,   (Al4Na4)Fe(CO)3
 and   (Al4K4)Fe(CO)3
respectively].

and Al4K4 to produce (Al4Li4)Fe(CO)3, (Al4Na4)Fe(CO)3 and (Al4K4)
Fe(CO)3.   Note   that   all   these   substitutions   are   highly   exothermic.
Small filled circles indicate the alkali metal ions. 

This suggests that the ligand interacts with the d-orbitals
of the Fe atom, with a transfer of 2 electrons from the metal
to the ligand (MLCT) making the Al4  ring a   6?  electron
aromatic   system.   Also,   note   that,   for   M=K,   the   BLA   is
maximum   in   the   series   consistent   with   the   smallest   net
aromaticity as supported by NICS and HOMO-LUMO gap
calculations.   The stability of the complexes is measured
using the fragmentation scheme:  (Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3 = Al4M4
+ Fe(CO)3; where the constituents are in their stable ground
state   geometric   configurations.   The   binding   energies
[defined as Ecomplex-Efragments] in (Al4Li4)-Fe(CO)3, (Al4Na4)-

Fe(CO)3  and   (Al4K4)-Fe(CO)3  are   -118.85   kcal/mol,
-122.92   kcal/mol   and   -126.28   kcal/mol   respectively.   For
comparison, we have also calculated the binding energies
in (C4H4)-Fe(CO)3, which is -70 kcal/mol. 
     The large stability associated with these molecules is due to the
formation of a stable closed shell 18-e configuration in each case.14 
The binding energy for   (Al4K4)-Fe(CO)3  is maximum
suggesting that in such complexes, only the ?-electrons on
the ring interact with the metal 3d orbitals and the poor ?-?
separation initially existing in the ligand is lifted and the
system behaves as an 18 electron stable molecule. This is a
very   important   result   as   one   can   fine   tune   the   ?-?
separations   by   functionalizing   the   Al4
rings   with
4- 
  The   magnitudes   for   the
electropositive   counterions.  
HOMO-LUMO gaps for the(Al4Li4)-Fe(CO)3, (Al4Na4)-Fe
(CO)3  and   (Al4K4)-Fe(CO)3  complexes   decrease   in   the
order   :     3.34   eV,     2.31   eV   and   1.85     eV   respectively,
suggesting the softer nature of the Al4K4  ligand. Another
major change that is associated with the formation of the
complexes is that the structure of the counterions are lost
completely.   As   already   mentioned,   the   counterions   are
arranged around the Al4 ring so as to have a C2h symmetry.
However, on complexation with the transition metal atoms,
the symmetry is completely lost. There is an overall loss in
energy of  the order 20 kcal/mol, compared to the ground
state structure of Al4M4. But, the stability associated with
the   formation   of   the   complex   with   the   3d   metal   atom
overwhelms the structural instability in the ligand. 

          Another very well-known route for stabilizing the
unstable   ligands   is   through   the   formation   of   sandwich
complexes similar to that in the case of ferrocene.15 For 4?
electronic systems like C4H4, (C4H4)2Ni is a well stabilized
complex.16  Similarly,   we   have   stabilized   sandwich
complexes of the type: (Al4M4)2Ni having binding energies
similar   to   that   for   the   organic   analogues.   The   binding
energies   for   (Al4Li4)2Ni,   (Al4Na4)2Ni   and   (Al4K4)2Ni   are
-146.05 kcal/mol, -147.12 kcal/mol and -103.12 kcal/mol
respectively.   Note   that,   lower   stabilization   in   (Al4K4)2Ni
arises from the distortion in the sandwich architecture due
to   the   presence   of   the   bulky   K+  ions   (see   structure   in
Scheme 1) as a result of which the average K+ ion distance
to the Al4
4-  ring is very large (3.5 Å). For (Al4Li4)2Ni and
4- ring is
(Al4Na4)2Ni, the average M+ distance from the Al4
3.0 Å.   This is also evident in the decreasing order of the
HOMO-LUMO gaps ( 1.623 eV, 1.323 eV and 0.954 eV
for   (Al4Li4)2Ni,   (Al4Na4)2Ni   and   (Al4K4)2Ni   respectively).
The binding energy for (C4H4)2Ni is -160.42 kcal/mol and
thus   unlike   the   cases   for   (Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3,   direct
substitution of C4H4 with Al4M4 will be highly endothermic
and thus quite unfavourable. For a detailed understanding
of   the   highly   exothermic   formation   of   (Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3
compared to the endothermic substitution product (Al4M4)
2Ni, the  HOMO orbitals   for  both  the systems  have  been
analysed (see supporting information file). The HOMO for
(Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3  shows   substantially   more   intermixing
between the d-orbitals of the  Fe(CO)3 fragment and the ?-

orbitals of Al4M4, leading to stronger complexation in the
case of (Al4M4)-Fe(CO)3. The presence of   three strong ?-
acceptor   CO   ligands   in   the   Fe(CO)3  fragment   leads   to
quenching   of   d-orbitals   on   the   Fe-atom   and   thereby
facilitates stronger binding between the Al4M4  ligand and
the Fe(CO)3 fragment. 

  In   view   of   the   above,   we   follow   here   a   different
strategy. We consider a substitution reaction of the type:
(C4H4)2Ni + Al4M4 = (C4H4)Ni (Al4M4) + C4H4. As
already mentioned, the Al4M4 binds stronger to the metal
center than C4H4. Therefore, we expect that it is possible
to   synthesise   a   hybrid   organic-inorganic   sandwich
complex.     These   hybrid   complexes   are   very   interesting
because, while for the C4H4 ligand, the interaction with the
transition metal atom involves only the  ? electrons, for the
Al4M4 ligand, the interaction are through both the ? and ?
orbitals. Interestingly, the extent of the involvement of the
?  and ?  orbitals in the interaction does also depend on the
nature of the counter ions present. In Fig. 3, we show the
frontier   orbital   plots   for   (C4H4)Ni(Al4Li4).   Similar
features are also seen in the cases of (C4H4)Ni(Al4Na4)
and (C4H4)Ni(Al4K4). From these orbitals, it is clear that
the ligand group orbitals (LGOs) on Al4M4 interact much
strongly   with   the   transition   metal   (Ni)   orbitals.
Specifically, the dZ2, dxz and dxy orbitals of Ni interact
with   the   LGOs   of   Al4M4   in   HOMO-1,   H0M0-2   and
HOMO-3 respectively. On the contrary, the LGOs of C4H4
interact very feebly with the transition metal orbitals, as a
result of which, the binding of the organic ligand with the
transition   metal   is   much   weaker   compared   to   that   for
Al4M4 in these mixed sandwich complexes. The structures
of these hybrid complexes are found to be quite stable. The
heat   of   formation   for   (C4H4)Ni   (Al4Li4),   (C4H4)Ni
(Al4Na4)   and   (C4H4)Ni   (Al4K4)   are   -153.93   kcal/mol,
-158.82   kcal/mol   and   -151.80   respectively.   This   is   in
marked contrast to that for the previous complexes where
the   heat   of   formation   for   the   complexes   increased
monotonically   with   the   increase   in   the   sizes   of   the
counterions   (Fig.   3).   The   HOMO-LUMO   gaps   in   the
hybrid complexes, however, follow the same trend as other
complexes:   2.01   eV   [(C4H4)Ni   (Al4Li4)],   1.96   eV
[(C4H4)Ni (Al4Na4)] and 1.35 eV [(C4H4)Ni (Al4K4)]. 

Figure   3  Frontier   orbital   diagrams   in   mixed   sandwich   complex,
(Al4Li4)Ni(C4H4). 

This   explains   smaller   binding   energy   in   the   hybrid
complex with K+ as the counterion compared to (C4H4)Ni
(Al4Li4)   and(C4H4)Ni(Al4Na4).   However,   compared   to
the Fe(CO)3 complexes, these complexes are softer as the
HOMO-LUMO gap is quite small. 

We   would   like   to   rationalize   the   synthesis   of   these
sandwich complexes in a 3 step reaction of the type: (C4H4)
Ni(C4H4)     to   (C4H4)Ni   (Al4M4)   and   finally   to   (Al4M4)Ni
(Al4M4) [shown in Scheme. 1].  

  As  already   shown   that   the   intermediates,   (C4H4)Ni
(Al4M4), are quite stable and can thus be isolated. However,
these   substitution   reactions   are   mildly   endothermic
(contrary to that for the Fe(CO)3 complexes) In this series,
the heat of formation is least endothermic for both (Al4Na4)
Ni(C4H4) and (Al4Na4)2Ni and thus are best candidates for
isolation.

organometallic   complex   (C4H4)2Ni.   The   energy   for   (C4H4)2Ni   has
been scaled to zero to show the endothermic substitution reactions.
Small filled circles indicate the alkali metal ions.

       The   BLA   for   C4H4   and   Al4M4   are   0.0092   and
0.0386   in   (C4H4)Ni   (Al4Li4),   0.0106   and   0.0168   in
(C4H4)Ni (Al4Na4) and 0.0033 and 0.10459 in  (C4H4)Ni
(Al4K4) respectively. Note that, for M=K, the Al4K4 unit
has a substantial BLA with a magnitude  close to that of
uncoordinated   Al4K4.   To   conclude,   we   propose
experimental  methodologies  for  possible synthesis   of the
first examples of all-metal half-sandwich, mixed sandwich
and full-sandwich complexes. Based on our high level DFT
calculations,   we   have   shown   that   while   half-sandwich
complexes can be readily formed due to the presence of ?-

accepting ligands like CO, the formation of mixed and full-
sandwich complexes are endothermic.

DOES CONSCIOUSNESS COLLAPSE THE WAVE FUNCTION

Abstract

A  conceptual  replication  of  the  Hall-experiment  to  test  the  ‘subjective
reduction’  interpretation  of  the  measurement  problem  in  Quantum  Physics  is
reported.  Two  improvements  are  introduced.  First  the  delay  between  pre-
observation and final observation of the same quantum event is increased from a
few  microseconds  in  the  original  experiment  to  1  second  in  this  replication.
Second,  rather  than  using  the  observers  conscious  response  as  the  dependent
variable,  we  use  the  early  brain  responses  as  measured  by  EEG.  These  early
responses cover a period where the observer is not yet conscious of the quantum
event. Results support the ‘subjective reduction’ hypothesis because significant
difference between the brain responses of the final observer are found dependent
upon  the  pre-observer  looking  or  not  looking  at  the  quantum  event  (exact
binomial  p  <  0.02).  Alternative  ‘normal’  explanations  are  discussed  and
rejected. It is concluded that the present results do justify further research along
these lines.

1  Introduction

1.1 The Problem

In 1977 Hall et al (Hall et al, 1977)) reported an experiment that, according to their
description, tested the most radical solution to the ‘measurement problem’ in quantum
physics,  namely  the  proposition  that  :  ….  The  reduction  of  the  wave  packet  is  a
physical event which occurs only when there is an interaction between the physical
measuring apparatus and the psyche of some observer…..

They defended their experiment writing: …  although  we  concur  that  there  is  a
genuine problem of the reduction of the wave packet, we do not intend in our paper to
defend this opinion against those who maintain that it is a pseudo problem…..

In spite of many attempts, like the relative state solution (Everett, 1957) and the
introduction  of  non-linear  terms  in  the  Schrödinger  equation  (Ghiradi,  1986),  the
measurement  problem  seems  still  not  be  solved.  This  failure  to  clearly  resolve  the
problem has left the physics community polarized with some contending the problem
remains a fundamental shortcoming in the quantum formalism and others holding that
there is no reduction of the wave packet at all (Bohm and Hiley, 1997; Griffith, 2002;
Dieks and Vermaas, 1998).   Costa de Beauregard (1976), Walker (1971, 1988, 2000)
and later Stapp (1993) have argued, using arguments provided by  a.o. von Neumann
(1955)  and  Wigner  (1967),  that  none  of  these  solutions  are  acceptable  and  that
subjective reduction is still a possible and even preferred alternative.

 We, like Hall et al, do not wish to fight this or any other position with regard to
the proper interpretation of the quantum formalism and the role of the measurement
therein, but like Hall and his collaborators, we would like to investigate this problem
experimentally.

1.2 Hall’s experiment

The Hall experiment is conceptually easy to understand. A quantum event, in this case
a radioactive decay, is measured in a counter and the signal is displayed on a scaler.
An observer 1 is observing the scaler. The scaler signal is transmitted through a delay
unit and displayed again. The second scaler is observed by ‘final’ observer 2.

Observer  1  will  sometimes  observe  but  sometimes  not  observe  his  scaler.
Observer  2  had  to  ‘guess’  if  a  quantum  event  observed  by  him  has  already  been
observed by observer 1 (see fig.1 from the original publication)

The results of this experiment were precisely at chance. I.e. the second observer
guessed 50% correct. Hence it was obvious that this observer was unable to detect if
the  observed  signal  had  already  been  observed  earlier.  It  was  concluded  that  the
experiment does not provide support for the hypothesis that it is the interaction with
consciousness that causes the wave packet to collapse.

1.3 The present conceptual replication

It should be made explicit that there is an implicit assumption of Hall et al that our
brains in some way are able to detect the difference between a superposition state and
a singular state. And also that this difference can be communicated consciously.

In a comment later added to the article the authors note that the used delay was
extremely short and that …. The delay time should be in the order of psychologically
discriminable  intervals……Since  the  original  Hall  paper  has  been  widely
acknowledged  as  evidence  against  the hypothesis  that  it  is  the  interaction  with
consciousness that causes the wave packet to collapse, it is essential that this serious
error in the Hall experiment be corrected by means of further testing. It is important
that  both  the  time  delay  be  of  a  physiological  significant  duration  and  that  the
determination as to whether the observers have been affected differently by the two
conditions be placed on a more objective foundation than the verbal report used by
Hall.

In the present conceptual replication the time between the first observation and the
second one was set to 1000 msecs. Indeed Libet’s seminal work on the processing
time needed for conscious experience sets a lower interval of about 300-500 msecs
because one should require the first observation to be a conscious one (Libet, 1991).
The difference with the original experiment goes a bit further than just adjusting this
interval.

Rather  than  asking  the  second  observer  for  a  conscious  guess  we  measure  the
brain  responses  to  the  stimulus.  This  is  done  for  the  following  reason:  If
consciousness  is  the  crucial  element  for  wave  packet  reduction,  the  conscious
decision, used as dependent variable in the original experiment, will be based on the
physical  state  of  the  wave  packet  after  consciousness  in  the  second  observer  has
developed.  At  that  time,  the  wave  packet  according  to  the  hypothesis  under
investigation, has already collapsed even if no pre-observation has taken place. Thus,
the  manipulation  of  the  pre-observer  will  not  induce  any  difference  in  the  final
observer with regard to his conscious behavior.

By measuring brain potentials of the second observer one can however also tap
into the early (< 300 msec) non conscious processing of the brain. At that time the
wave packet is supposedly still in superposition, but only if no pre-observation has
taken place.

2 Design of the experiment

Quantum  events  were  generated  by  an  alpha  particle  source  (as  used  in  smoke
detectors; 2P40-76-18) that was mounted on slider allowing the source to be moved
with  respect  to  a  lead  shielded  Geiger-Muller  counter  (Automess  6150-100).  The
distance was set so that on the average 1 particle about every second was detected.
The  counter  pulse  was  amplified  and  fed  to  the  trigger  channel  of  an  EEG  data-
acquisition system (Biosemi Active-1,  2003). We used National Instruments LabView
software (NI, 2003) to detect this trigger and to transform it into a delayed audio beep
of  1500  Hz  and  50  msecs  duration.   The  audio-delay  was  1  second.  The  software
randomly would generate a visual stimulus of   ~65 msecs duration directly upon the
trigger. The visual stimulus therefore preceeds the audio-beep by a time sufficient for
the first observer for conscious experience of the quantum event before the second
observer  (see  fig.2).  The  random  decision  to  show  this  visual  stimulus  to  the  first
observer before submitting the beep to the second observer or not was pseudo random
with  the  seed  determined  by  the  computer  clock.  After  each  quantum  event  thus
measured there was a dead time of 2 seconds during which the input of the Geiger-
Muller  counter  was  discarded.  The  subjects  were  asked  to  count  the  number  of
observed quantum events.

The  quantum  mechanical  theory  of  radioactive  decay  describes  the  emitting
particle  as  a  superposition  of  two  states,  the  decayed  and  the  non-decayed  state.
Although  our  measurement  system  is  a  composite  many  particle  system  it  can  be
regarded  as  being  in  a  superposition  of  a  ‘decayed’  and  a  ‘non-decayed’  state.
According  to  the  radical  proposition  under  consideration,  a  reduction  of  this
superposition occurs only when an observer ‘looks’ at one of the two indicators of the
emission. Either observation of the visual or the audio representation would collapse
the wave packet.

3 Experimental Procedure

Subjects
Volunteer subjects were invited in pairs. These were generally freshman psychology
students who participated for course credit. In total 9 male and 21 females, providing
useful  data,  participated  in  the  experiment  (mean  age=21.4,  sd=4.7).  Two  subjects
were removed from the analysis because the brain signals they provided were noisy
due to a loose electrode.

Upon arrival they were fully informed about the purpose and potential implication
of the experiment. First they participated in a so-called odd-ball task used to test the
equipment.  Then  the  crucial  task,  which  we,  for  obvious  reasons,  called  the
‘Schrödinger-task’ was presented. The role of observer 1 and 2 were played by both
subjects in two separate runs.

Physiological measurement and further procedure.
Sintered  AgCl  EEG  electrodes  with  active  preamplifiers  (Biosemi  Active  1)  were
connected  to  the  head  of  observer-2  using  the  standardized  10/20  system  (see
appendix  1).  No  temporal  electrodes  were  used.  Then  observer  2  went  to  a
neighboring room and was seated in a relaxing chair while observer 1 stayed at the
computer  screen  with  the  experimenter.  A  short  ‘calibration’  experiment  was  run
consisting of the above mentioned odd-ball task in which observer-2 was presented
each 3 seconds (with one second random jitter) audio beeps of 30 msecs duration.
Hundred beeps with either a frequency of 1200 Hz or a frequency of 2000 Hz were
presented.  The  frequency  was  randomly  determined  with  the  probability  for  the
higher frequency  4 times as low as for the lower. The subject was asked to count the
higher frequency beeps. Their brain signals were sampled with a frequency of 2400
samples per second. If the resulting average evoked brain potentials conformed to the
well  know  average  auditory  brain  potential  (Picton  et  al,  1974),  the  actual
‘Schrödinger’ run was started with observer 1 sitting in front of the computer screen
observing the visual stimulus that appeared in about 50% of the cases directly upon a
radioactive decay. The experimenter refrained from looking at this screen. The total
run consisted of 120 radio-active decay events. This took about 8 minutes.

After a short break roles were switched and the procedure was repeated. The total

experiment took less than one hour.

To  prevent  ourselves  from  data  snooping  and  data  selection  with  the  goal  to  ‘find
what  we  were  searching  for’,  we  first  analyzed  the  results  of  the  standard,  and
completely unrelated, odd-ball task. Once we had fixed the complete procedure on the
basis of exploration of these odd-ball task data we would allow ourselves to analyze
the actual data.

On the basis of the explorations of the odd-ball data it was concluded that two of
the 32 subjects were not providing valid EEG data. Furthermore these odd-ball data
were  used  to  establish  an  optimal  preprocessing  procedure.  The  thus  established
preprocessing  procedure  consisted  of  4  steps.  All  signals  were  re-referenced  to
(compared to) the signal at the Pz electrode.   First a 50 Hz notch filter was applied,
then the data were filtered through a band pass filter between 1 and 30 Hz (slopes =
24 db/Oct). Then (eye) movement artifacts were removed from the data. The criteria
used were ‘absolute value’ and ‘derivative’. On the average this algorithm removed
about 5-10% of the available segments.   Because there is a high correlation between
the results obtained from different leads (electrodes) we did a factor analysis to see
how we could combine the signals of different leads into a compound signal. This
analysis gave two clear factors, one consisting of the central and frontal leads with a
mean factor load of 0.87 and one for the parietal electrodes with a mean factor load of
0.93.  We called the two combined signals ‘FC’ which is the average of 11 leads (Fpz,
Fp1, Fp2, Fz, F7, F3, F8, F4, Cz, C3, C4)  and ‘P’ which is the average of two leads
(P3 and P4).

4 Results

After  having  thus  established  the  data  to  be  used,  and  a  well  specified
preprocessing procedure we applied this without further adaptation to the EEG data
obtained in the ‘Schrödinger’ part of the experiment. First we averaged all the data
pooled over subjects and pre-observer condition per sample for the FC- and P-signal
separately.

The  thus  obtained  evoked  potentials  were  submitted  to  the  automatic  peak
detection procedure of the standard BrainVision analyzer software. Results are given
in fig. 3.

Note  that  in  figure  3  the  evoked  potentials  are  still  pooled  over  pre-observer
conditions.  In  order  to  check  if  the  pre-observation  by  a  first  observer  makes  a
difference for the brain signals of the final observer we have to split the data for the
two pre-observer conditions.

In figure 4 the same evoked potentials are plotted but this time separately for the
two pre-observer conditions. Under the null-hypotheses (that pre-observation doesn’t
matter) the difference between the two curves should be nill.

Statistical Analysis of peak amplitudes
As  usual  in  these  EEG  data,  the  two  traces  for  the  two  conditions  do  not
completely  coincide.  In  order  to  assess  if  the  observed  differences  are  statistically
meaningful we did a simple comparison between the signal value at peak position for
the pre-observed and the non pre-observed trials.

All peaks obtained by the automatic peak detection procedure were analyzed:
For the combined frontal and central leads: N20, P40, N100, P200, N300, P350
and N400. At exact 17,   41, 95, 178, 292, 357 and 411 msecs after stimulus onset.
(The convention in EEG plots is generally that positive voltage is plotted “down”, i.e.
to  the bottom  of the page.) For  the  two combined parietal leads,   P100,  N170  and
N200 at exact 99, 160 and 212 msecs after stimulus onset.

In Table I, column 3, we give the differences for the peak amplitudes between the
two observer-conditions. As said before these differences should be negligible under
the  assumption  that  the  fact  that  someone  has  observed  the  same  quantum  event
earlier  doesn’t  matter.   A  standard  t-test  was  run  to  find  the  probabilities  that  the
observed  differences  are  due  to  chance  (column  5).  In  order  to  assess  the  over-all
probability of these differences between the peaks we calculated the exact binomial
probability of finding three significant differences in a total of 10 analyses. The over-
all probability thus calculated is p= 0.0115.

Besides of the results of the parametric t-test we also calculated the results of the
non-parametric binomial tests. In this latter test the magnitude of the difference is not
relevant, only the direction for each subject. It can be argued that the non-parametric
test  is  more  suitable  since  the  differences  between  two  evoked  potentials  are  not
necessarily normally distributed.    An overall assessment of the non parametric tests
using the same binomial approach as above gives a total p-value of p= 0.0106.

From these results the following conclusions may be drawn:

1.  With regard to the signal from frontal and central leads there is a significant
difference  between  the  conditions  in  the  very  early  peaks.  This  difference  is  gone
after about 100 milliseconds.

2.  On the parietal leads the difference is into the other direction and arises later

with a clear maximum at 200 milliseconds.

5 Discussion

The results of these experiments do support a solution of the measurement problem
that gives a special status for conscious observation in the measurement process. The
absence of significant differences in the late evoked potential appears to be in line
with the fact that in the original Hall experiment no differences were found when one
asked the second observer to consciously express his feeling if the observed quantum
event had already been observed. This finding however should be treated cautiously
because the lack of statistical power in the later phases of the response. This lack of
power is caused by increased variance with increasing latency times.

Before  drawing  far  reaching  conclusions  we  should  first  check  if  there  are  no

more mundane explanations for the current findings.

Alternative explanations

Spurious sensory cueing of the second observer has been considered. The reason
for  having  the  first  observer  observe  a visual representation of the quantum event
rather  than  a  audio-beep  was  indeed  to  prevent  any  audio  leakage  to  the  second
observer.  Both  observers  were  in  adjacent  and  not  auditory  or  electromagnetically
shielded rooms. Ultrasonic or electromagnetic signatures from the monitor displaying
the  signal  for  the  first  observer might  still  have presented  sensory  cues.  Thus  the
second observer might have produced a slightly different auditory evoked potential
due to this earlier pre-observation related ultra-sound. This scenario, however, is not
very plausible in that it would result in affecting the peaks in the evoked potential in a
systematic way. The timing of the visual stimulus to the first observer and the delayed
audio beep to the second is not precise and therefore one can hardly expect a well-
defined effect in time.

A  second  explanation  might  be  found  in  improper  randomization  of  the  pre-
observer  condition.  It  is  well  known  that  evoked  potentials  on  simple  stimuli  like
beeps tend to habituate (decline). Thus the amplitude of the signal becomes smaller in
the course of the experiment. If, for some reason, the randomization did result in a
non-balanced  distribution  of  conditions  in  time  this  could  artificially  induce  a
differential effect due to habituation. We tested this idea using the actual sequence of
stimulus  conditions  as  they  occurred  in  the  experiment  with  several  habituation
models. None of these models gave any effect (p-values around 0.77). As a further
test  on  the  validity  of  the  peak  differences  that  we  found  between  the  two  pre-
observer  conditions,  we  ‘randomly’  relabeled  the  markers  so  that  we  created  two
pseudo-conditions for which we did exactly the same peak difference analysis. The
result  of  this  analysis  was  at  chance  level.  (the  mean  difference  found  was  0.16
microvolts at the P40. This is 6 times smaller than the real effect).

Although the current results look pretty robust, they are not extremely improbable
in terms of statistics. Although the applied over-all assessment is a bit conservative
since it  treats the more significant peaks as being of the same significance as the least
significant  peak,  one  could  argue  that  the  current  findings  might  be  attributable  to
chance with a probability of 1 in 50.  Although this figure satisfies the criterion of 5%
which  is  generally  accepted  as  the  significance  criterion,  it  is  not  enough  to
unequivocally  accept  the  hypothesis  that  consciousness  collapses  the  state  vector.
Strong claims need strong evidence.

Further work
The  further  crucial  experiment  in  which  the  radioactive  source  is  replaced  by  a
pseudorandom source is presently underway. In this experiment, the differential effect
should  disappear  in  this  latter  condition  as  the  quantum  character  of  the  observed
event is crucial. This further work will be reported subsequently.

In these replication studies we now are also able to predict more precisely where

and when to look for differences in the brain signals.

The role of the video-camera which was brought in to ensure that an interaction of
‘states’  of  both  observers  was  entering  the  state  description  of  the  experiment  is
another factor that can be explored. If such a camera is necessary, it would follow that
the current set-up could not be used to ‘send signals’ outside of the light cone and
hence does not violate relativity theory.

So far the concept of a conscious observation has not been worked out in detail. In
Libet’s work, which we used to estimate the delay between perceptual input and the
conscious  experience  thereof,  the  conscious  observation  is  by  definition  an
observation  which  is  stored  in  memory.  However  there  is  suggestive  evidence,  for
instance from ‘change blindness’ experiments, that there is another form of ‘faster’
conscious experience directly related to perceptual input (Landman et al, 2003). This
experience  is  not  stored  in  memory.  In  further  work  it  might  be  necessary  to
discriminate between these and possibly other forms of conscious experience.

In work in the field of ‘Artificial Intelligence’, the question has arisen if future
computers might become conscious. The present results suggest that such a question
can become empirically testable.

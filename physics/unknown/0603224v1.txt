Abstract 

START, a high-efficiency and low-noise scintillation detector for ionizing particles, was developed 
for the purpose of creating a high-granular system for triggering cosmic muons. Scintillation light 
in  START  is  detected  by  MRS  APDs  (Avalanche  Photo-Diodes  with  Metal-Resistance-
Semiconductor structure), operated in the Geiger mode, which have 1 mm2 sensitive areas. START 
is assembled from a 15 × 15 × 1 cm3 scintillating plastic plate, two MRS APDs and two pieces of 
wavelength-shifting  optical  fiber  stacked  in  circular  coils  inside  the  plastic.  The  front-end 
electronic  card  is  mounted  directly  on  the  detector.  Tests  with  START  have  confirmed  its 
operational consistency, over 99% efficiency of MIP registration and good homogeneity. START 
demonstrates a low intrinsic noise of about 10-2 Hz. If these detectors are to be mass-produced, the 
cost of a mosaic array of STARTs is estimated at a moderate level of 2–3 kUSD/m2. 

1. 

Introduction 

Scintillation counters are studied by the ITEP group in ALICE/LHC TOF project in the context 
of  creating  a  cosmic  triggering  system,  proposed  for  regular  tests  of  a  quantity  of  ALICE  TOF 
modules in the course of their mass production and maintenance [1]. The objective is to build a cosmic 
ray telescope from a mosaic array of scintillating plates, which would cover several tens of m2, provide 
100% detection efficiency and which could be mounted onto a simple supporting structure.  

A modern technique, which involves Avalanche Photo-Diodes (APDs) with a Metal-Resistance-
Semiconductor  (MRS)  structure,  operated  in  the  Geiger  mode  [2],  has  been  proposed  for  the 
registration of scintillation light. These detectors (hereinafter MRS APDs) were invented, designed and 
are  currently  produced  at  CPTA  (Center  of  Perspective  Technologies  and  Apparatus).  Significant 
progress in the development of MRS APDs has been achieved over the last few years [3].  

MRS  APDs  consume  relatively  little  power  and  require  a  bias  voltage  of  50–60 V.  They  are 
sensitive  to  single  photons  at  room  temperatures  and  demonstrate  intrinsic  gain  of  up  to  106  [4].  As 
compared to standard PMTs, MRS APDs do not require special housing or bulky light-conductors and 
can be mounted directly inside scintillating plates. This fact considerably simplifies the construction of 
a large-scale triggering system. 

2.  START construction 

Scintillator-fiber  systems  represent  a  popular  tool  for  particle  registration,  and  they  have  been 
implemented  in  a  number  of  experiments  in  high-energy  physics.  As  an  example,  this  technique  has 
been in use for several years by the HERA-B electromagnetic calorimeter at DESY, the scintillation 
light there being detected by PMTs [5].

START (as abbreviated from Scintillation Tile with MRS APD Light ReadouT) is a detector of 
ionizing particles, assembled from a scintillating plate, two MRS APDs and two pieces of wavelength-
shifting (WLS) optical fibers. Its key distinction from other detectors of this kind lies in the fact that 
START uses high-gain MRS APDs as photosensors. The scintillator size, as dictated by geometry of 
the  ALICE  TOF  test  facility,  has  been  set  equal  to  150  × 150  × 10 mm3.  Several  types  of  plastic 
scintillators were tested, concentrating mainly on BC-4121. To get the best internal reflection and light 
collection, all the plates were diamond polished and wrapped in an opaque material. 

The  influence  of  MRS  APD  intrinsic  noise  on  detector  performance  has  been  significantly 
decreased by fitting out one scintillating plate with two MRS APDs, plugged into a coincidence gate. 
The shaping time is usually set in the range of 20–80 ns, providing noise reduction of several orders of 
magnitude. 

The appearance of START is shown in Fig. 1. The collection of light inside the plastic and its 
transportation  towards  MRS  APDs  is  performed  by  commonly  available  WLS  fibers,  1 mm  in 
diameter.  Fiber  flexibility  allows  for  packing  them  in  several  circular  coils,  thus  increasing  the  light 
collection efficiency over the plastic volume. One end of each piece of fiber is covered with reflecting

3.  MRS APD 

APDs have long since been invented and integrated into scintillator-fiber systems for the needs 
of  particle  physics,  astrophysics  and  medical  imaging.  APDs  demonstrate  fast  response  and  high 
quantum efficiencies, and they are under intensive study in the framework of design and construction 
of  LHC  experiments  [6].  Radiation-hard  types  of  APDs  have  been  developed  to  be  used  on  a  large 
scale in the CMS electromagnetic calorimeter [7]. The relatively low gain (~103) of APD is its main 
disadvantage, restricting its use for light-detection [8]. 

The  drastic  increase  in  APD  gain  can  be  achieved  by  setting  the  bias  voltage  above  the 
breakdown  point.  This  mode  of  operation  (the  Geiger  mode)  is  implemented  in  MRS  APD,  which 
represents  a  1 mm2  matrix  of  micro-cells  with  MRS  intrinsic  structure,  each  sized  20  × 30 µm2, 
processed  on  a  common  p-type  silicon  substrate,  as  illustrated  in  Fig. 2.  To  decrease  the  overall 
electric  resistance,  the  substrate  is  heavily  doped  with  p+  from  the  bottom.  The  n+-doping  of  micro-
cells  creates  a  high  electric  field  in  the  vicinity  of  the  p–n-junction.  This  field  is  sufficient  for  the 
development of local avalanches from the initial photo-ionization in exposed micro-cells. Avalanche 
quenching is ensured by a voltage drop on the resistive layer, which is located under the upper contact.

idea  was  realized  in  START 
by  means  of  WLS  fibers  re-emitting  the  light  in  the  region  close  to  500 nm.  Experimenting  with 
different  fiber  types  has  resulted  in  a  multi-fold  increase  of  the  MRS  APD  output.  Double  cladding 
Kuraray Y112 fibers have been finally chosen as the optimal solution for START.

The  MRS  APD  gain  can  possibly  be  as  high  as  106.  In  reality,  the  optimal  working  point 
corresponds to the gain value set between 105 and 106. If the discriminating threshold is fixed at 3–4 
photo-electrons, the noise rate of MRS APD is about 103–104 Hz. In this case, setting the coincidence 
gate length for two MRS APDs in START at 10–20 ns reduces the overall detector noise to ~10-2 Hz, 
which  is  a  negligible  quantity.  A  detailed  discussion  of  the  MRS  APD  parameters  may  be  found  in 
Ref. [4]. 

4.  Detector performance  

A special front-end electronic (FEE) card for START signal processing was designed, tested and 
built.  Since  a  single  detector  contains  two  MRS  APDs,  the  card  involves  two  separate  amplifying 
channels and two resistive dividers for independent setting of the bias voltage in the range 50–60 V. 
The following averaged parameters of the card have been measured: 

(1)  Amplification — 0.8 V/pC. 
(2)  Noise (Cinput = 0) — less than 1500 electrons. 
(3)  Linearity — up to 300 fC at the input level. 
(4)  Timing resolution of the coincidence circuit — 20 ns. 

A detailed description of the FEE card may be found in Ref. [10]. The card is compact and may 
be attached directly to the START body as shown in Fig. 3. Contacts of MRS APDs are solded to the 
card with no additional wiring.  

Multiple beam and cosmic tests were carried out at ITEP and CERN in 2003. Various START 
options  and  characteristics  were  studied,  including  plastic,  fiber  and  APD  types,  detector  geometry, 
light collection, etc.  

First  START  samples  were  studied  by  means  of  pion  and  proton  beams  with  several  GeV/c 
momenta.  The  trigger  was  generated  by  scintillation  counters  positioned  along  the  beam  path.  To 
clarify the pedestal position, amplitude measurements were performed with a wide beam, so that some 
particles  missed  the  detector.  Fig. 4  represents  a  typical  amplitude  distribution  from  one  of  the  two

be set with an accuracy of 1–2%, the discriminator threshold with an accuracy of 10%.

Surface  uniformity  of  START  was  thoroughly  scanned  with  a  small-size  beam.  Amplitude 
characteristics  in  the  most  important  points  (i.e.  in  the  center,  outside  the  fiber  ring,  at  some  point 
exactly  on  the  fiber  ring  and  at  the  edge)  are  shown  in  Fig. 5.  When  the  beam  pointed  at  the  edge, 
some particles missed the detector, making the pedestal position clear in the corresponding spectrum 
(bottom  left).  It  may  be  seen  that  the  four  spectra  look  much  alike,  the  mean  values  being  the  same 
within  8–10%  of  accuracy. 
The efficiency remains above 
99%.  These  factors  prove 
that  START  is  sufficiently 
homogeneous  and 
is  an 
appropriate  solution  for  the 
cosmic triggering system.

development of technology over the last two years has already resulted in a 3–4-fold decrease of the 
MRS APD cost. The prediction is that this cost reduction will continue. Moreover, the FEE card may 
get cheaper if a more integrated design is employed. 

6.  Conclusion 

Scintillating plates with MRS APD light readout show stable characteristics. Signals produced in 
response to MIP are clear and stay far above the pedestal value. Registration efficiency remains close 
to 100% over the whole detector surface. Required voltage supply is about 50 V. Intrinsic noise stays 
at the level of 10-2 Hz and can be easily decreased to 10-3–10-4 Hz. Due to their geometry, STARTs can 
be arranged in large arrays to form a high-granular low-noise detecting system.

Abstract

We observe that an antisymplectic manifold locally always admits a parity structure. This
induces an odd metric and its Levi-Civita connection, and thereby a new notion of an odd K¨ahler
geometry. We ﬁnd that an odd K¨ahler manifold in this new sense has a canonical volume form
and that the odd Laplacian is nilpotent in this case. The local cohomology of the odd Laplacian
is derived. Finally, we give a vielbein formulation of antisymplectic manifolds.

Introduction

Odd symplectic geometry was ﬁrst introduced in 1981 by Batalin and Vilkovisky [1] in antiﬁeld
formulation of gauge theories. It was soon realized that many of the constructions in even sym-
plectic geometry, could be transfered into odd symplectic geometry. However, there are important
exceptions: For instance, there is no canonical volume element in the odd case. The main applica-
tions of odd symplectic geometry has up to now been quantization of gauge theories and covariant
formulations of string ﬁeld theory [2]. Many authors Khurdaverdian and Nersessian[3], Batalin and
Tyutin [4], Schwarz [5], and Hata and Zwiebach [6], have contributed to a covariant formulation of
odd symplectic geometry.

The paper is roughly organized as follows: After a short review of anti-symplectic geometry, we
introduce in Section 2 the notion of an almost parity structure. The main idea is that whereas
the Grassmann parity in general is a property of the local coordinate charts only, we would like to
ask when it is as a property of the manifold. The appropriate tool is an almost parity structure.
With an almost parity structure at hand we may introduce various new geometric constructions.
In Section 4 we discuss a connection in anti symplectic geometry. In Section 5 we restrict ourself
to consider odd K¨ahler manifolds. Finally, we give a vielbein formulation in Section 6. Super
conventions are written down in an Appendix.

1.1 Basic Settings

Let the number 2n of variables be ﬁnite. The antisymplectic phase space M is a (n|n) real super-
space with a non-degenerate antibracket,

(F, G) = (F

EABEBC = δA

→

∂zA G) ,

←
∂r
∂zA )EAB(
C = ECBEBA ,

or equivalently an anti-symplectic two-form

E = 1

2 dzA EAB ∧ dzB = − 1

2 EAB dzB ∧ dzA .

The Jacobi identity can neatly be restated as that the two-form E is closed

The antibracket has the following symmetry

dE = 0 .

(G, F ) = − (−1)(ǫF +1)(ǫG+1)(F, G) ,

EBA = −(−1)(ǫA+1)(ǫB +1)EAB
EBA = −(−1)ǫAǫB EAB

,
,

ǫ(EAB) = ǫA + ǫB + 1 ,
ǫ(EAB) = ǫA + ǫB + 1 .

Locally there exist an anti-symplectic potential ϑ = ϑA dzA such that E = dϑ. Written out

EAB = (

→
A ϑB) + (−1)ǫAǫB (
∂l

→
∂l
B ϑA) .

Locally one may resort to anti-symplectic Darboux coordinates zA = (φα, φ∗

(1.8)

1.2 Odd Pfaﬃan

Perhaps one of the most important diﬀerence between even versus odd symplectic geometry is
that there is no canonical Liouville measure1 in odd symplectic geometry. The naive guess would
probably be an odd Pfaﬃan Pf(EAB) of EAB. But it is easy to see that the volume element cannot
be a function of EAB. This is because an anti-symplectic coordinate change zA → z′A(z), which
by deﬁnition leaves EAB invariant, may not be volume preserving, i.e. the volume density ρ may
changes although EAB is not being changed.

On the other hand, there is a closed one-form

C ≡ 1

2 dzA(

→
A EBC )ECB(−1)ǫB = 0 ,
∂l

(1.9)

which is zero by the Darboux Theorem. A reasonable deﬁnition of the odd Pfaﬃan Pf(E··) should
evidently satisfy C = d ln Pf(E··). So according to this identiﬁcation Pf(E··) is a constant.
It
therefore transforms as a scalar. This is in striking contrast to the even symplectic case, where the
Pfaﬃan of the symplectic metric transforms as a scalar density.

2 Almost Parity Structure

2.1 Almost Darboux Coordinates

Let us introduce the notion of “almost Darboux coordinates”. These are coordinates where all
non-vanishing entries of the anti-symplectic metric are bosonic, i.e.

ǫ(EAB) ≡ ǫA + ǫB + 1 = 0 .

(2.1)

A set of Darboux coordinates is an example of almost Darboux coordinates, as the name indicates.
Let us for completeness mention that under the assumption of invertibility, the following conditions
are equivalent:

1. EAB is almost Darboux coordinates.

2. EAB is bosonic.

3. EBA = −EAB is antisymmetric.

4. EBA = −EAB is antisymmetric.

5. EAB is bosonic.

6. EAB anticommutes with the Grassmann parity operator (−1)ǫA:

((−1)ǫA + (−1)ǫB )EAB ≡ (−1)ǫAEAB + EAB(−1)ǫB = 0 .

(2.2)

1In this paper all measure densities ρ are signed single-valued densities. This means that the supermanifold (and

in particular the body) has to be orientable.

Almost Darboux coordinates are clearly stabile under Grassmann preserving coordinate changes
zA → z′B(z), i.e. when the non-vanishing entries of the Jacobian-matrix

has even Grassmann-grading

ǫ(z′B

2.2 Almost Parity Structure

The Grassmann parity operator (−1)ǫA is invariant under Grassmann preserving changes of coordi-
nates (2.4) but not under general coordinate transformations. Also let us note that the Grassmann
parity is a property of the coordinates, not the manifold itself. Let us generalize the Grassmann
parity operator (−1)ǫA to a covariant object in the following way. Consider a general (n+|n−)
supermanifold M . An almost parity structure P : T M → T M is a Grassmann-even (1, 1)-tensor,
whose square is the identity,

P = ∂r

A P A

B ⊗

→
dzB ,

1

2 [P, P ] = P 2 = Id = ∂r

A ⊗

→
dzA .

ǫ(P A

B) = ǫA + ǫB ,

We will furthermore assume that the supertrace of P is equal to the dimension of the manifold:

It is convenient to introduce the idempotent projection operators

(−1)ǫAP A

A = str(P ) = n+ + n− .

P± = 1

2 (Id ± P ) ,

Id = P+ + P− , P = P+ − P− , P±P± = P± , P±P∓ = 0 . (2.7)

Consider a point m ∈ M on the manifold, and a coordinate system which cover this point m. The
canonical basis of tangent vectors in TmM wrt. the choosen coordinate system is (∂r
A)A=1,...,n++n−.
However Pm : TmM → TmM may not be diagonal in this basis. To diagonalize the almost parity
structure Pm, one should perform a change of the basis to a new basis (er
(A))A=1,...,n++n− for the
tangent space TmM :

A = er
∂r

(B) ΛB

A ,

where ΛB
A is an invertible matrix. We will restrict the allowed basis shift to shift that carries
deﬁnite Grassmann parity ǫ(ΛB
A) = ǫA + ǫB. The almost parity structure P : TmM → TmM is di-
agonalizable in this restricted sense with eigenvalues σ = ±1. The eigenspaces for P are P±(T M ).
Moreover, we see from the condition (2.6), that the eigenspace P+(T M ) (P−(T M )) has multiplic-
ity n+ (n−) and their bases carry Grassmann parity 0 (1), respectively. As a consequence the
superdeterminant of P is

sdet(P ) = (−1)n− .

Proposition. Two almost parity structures P(1) and P(2) are globally related via similarity trans-
formations, i.e. there exists a global automorphism Λ : T M → T M , such that P(1)Λ = ΛP(2).

Sketched proof: To prove the statement locally, we choose a coordinate system. It is enough to
show that P is related via a similarity transformation to the Grassmann parity. This follows from
the discussion above. Finally, the global statement follows by use of a partition of the unity.

tensor N , the K¨ahler potential K, the Dolbeaux diﬀerentials, etc. A diﬀerent approach binding to-
gether K¨ahler and BV geometry has been studied by Aoyama and Vandoren [7] and Khurdaverdian
and Nersessian [8].

2.3 Canonical Examples

Darboux Coordinates. It is perhaps useful to be a bit more explicit in case of an antisymplectic
(n|n) supermanifold with an almost parity structure P . Consider Darboux coordinates.

Almost Darboux Coordinates. Let us next consider an example of almost Darboux coordinates
zA = (xα; θ ¯α), where α, ¯α = 1, . . . , n, and where xα are bosons and θ ¯α are fermions. The almost
parity structure P is assumed to be equal to the Grassmann parity P A
B. As a conse-
quence the Nijenhuis tensor N for the almost parity structure P vanishes (see Section 3.4). Because
the coordinates are almost Darboux, the block diagonal pieces of the antisymplectic metric vanish,

B = (−1)ǫAδA

cf. (2.13). From the closeness of the antisymplectic two-form E, one may prove that there exists
locally a corresponding odd parity potential K = K(x, θ) such that

Eαβ = 0 = E ¯α ¯β ,

− Eα ¯β = E ¯βα = (

K

→
∂l
∂θ ¯β

←
∂r
∂xα ) .

K ′(x, θ) − K(x, θ) = F (x) + ¯F (θ) .

Moreover, any other odd parity potential K ′ diﬀers from K in the following way:

The parity potential K is quite similar to the K¨ahler potential K appearing in standard complex
diﬀerential geometry. When there is no confusion, we shall simply call K a K¨ahler potential. The
parity preserving coordinate transformations are transformations of the form

xα → x′α(x) ,

θ ¯α → θ′ ¯α(θ) .

(2.21)

In this example the eigenspaces are:

P+(T M ) = span(

P−(T M ) = span(

→
∂l
∂xα ) ,

→
∂l
∂θα ) .

The submanifolds

{(xα; θ ¯α)|xα = xα

(0)} ,

{(xα; θ ¯α)|θ ¯α = θ ¯α

(0)}.

are two Lagrangian submanifolds of Grassmann parity (n|0) and (0|n), respectively, that intersect
the point zA

(0) = (xα

(0); θ ¯α

(0)).

Let us for simplicity restrict to the case of constant almost Darboux coordinates

The group G of anti-symplectic, parity preserving coordinate transformations is a subgroup of the
rigid (“global”, “point independent”) transformations. In fact, it is the semidirect product of the
rigid translations and the rigid GL(n) group of linear transformations of the form

3 Parity Structure

3.1 Deﬁnition of Parity Structure

Consider a (n+|n−) supermanifold M equipped with an almost parity structure P . A coordinate
system is said to adapt an almost parity structure P if the canonical basis of tangent vectors ∂r
A
are eigenvectors for the almost parity structure P with eigenvalue (−1)ǫA:

or equivalently

B P B
∂r

A ≡ P (∂r

A) = (−1)ǫA∂r

A .

(P T )A

B ∂l

B = (−1)ǫA∂l

A .

We shall see in the Section 3.4 that the Nijenhuis tensor N corresponding to the almost parity
structure P vanishes in regions of the manifold that are covered by P -adapted coordinate patches.
We will also see that the two eigenspaces Pσ(T M ) are stabile under the Lie bracket [ , ] in these
regions.

P -adapted coordinates are also almost Darboux coordinates, cf. Section 2.1, but the opposite need
not be the case.

A parity preserving coordinate transformation is a coordinate transformation between two local
coordinate system such that the non-vanishing entries of the Jacobian-matrix

(3.26)

(3.27)

(3.28)

←
∂r
∂zA

z′B

has positive P -parity, i.e. is bosonic. So a parity preserving coordinate transformation is the
same as a Grassmann parity preserving coordinate transformation, cf. 2.4. Note that a coordi-
nate transformation between two P -adapted coordinate patches is a parity preserving coordinate
transformation.

An almost parity structure P is a parity structure iﬀ there exists an atlas of P -adapted coordinate
charts.

An odd pre-K¨ahler manifold is by deﬁnition an antisymplectic (n|n)-manifold M with a parity
structure P that is compatible with the antisymplectic structure E, cf. (2.10). We will later show
that odd pre-K¨ahler manifolds can be equipped with a canonical odd metric and its Levi-Cevita
connection.

We conclude that an antisymplectic (n|n)-manifold M possesses a compatible Grassmann parity
structure iﬀ there exists an atlas of almost Darboux charts, which are mutually connected via
Grassmann parity preserving transformations, see also (2.4). This means that every point in the
manifold is intersected by a P -adapted (n|0) and a (0|n) Lagrangian submanifold, cf. (2.13).

Below follows an analysis of the integrability of an almost parity structure P .

the eigenspace Pσ(T M ), σ = ±1.

3.3 An Odd Parity Conjugation

Consider an (n|n) antisymplectic supermanifold M . What should be the analog of complex con-
jugation? Loosely speaking, it should be the operation that takes ﬁelds φα into its corresponding
antiﬁeld φ∗
α. Let us start by deﬁning the concept of odd parity conjugation in the frame bundle over
the manifold. Let (e(A))A=1,...,2n be a basis for the tangent space T M . Then the parity conjugated
basis (e(A)

)A=1,...,2n (of opposite Grassmann parity) is the unique basis such that
E(e(A), e(B)

) = δA

(3.35)

B .

∗

∗

Applying conjugation twice yields a minus
e∗∗
(A) = − e(A) .
For a tangent vector X = X Ae(A) we deﬁne a parity conjugated tangent vector X ∗ = X Ae(A)
.
This of course depends strongly on the choice of basis. Also the notion of real and imaginary
part has no counterpart. The only nice things to say is that no matter which basis we choose,
the conjugation is linear, X ∗∗ = −X, and the conjugation gives a bijection between P+(T M ) and
P−(T M ), the counterpart of holomorphic and anti-holomorphic vector ﬁelds.
If we choose the
canonical basis e(A) = ∂l
A, we have [X, Y ]∗ = [X ∗, Y ∗]. This makes the notion of parity conjugation
a strong theoretical tool.

(3.36)

∗

For an one-form η the parity conjugated one-form η∗ is deﬁned via η∗(X) = η(X ∗). The above
deﬁnitions leads to the convenient rules

3.4 Nijenhuis Tensor

We start by deﬁning two tensors Nσ : T M × T M → T M ,

N±(X, Y ) = P∓[P±X, P±Y ] = − (−1)ǫ(X)ǫ(Y )N±(Y, X) .
Note that N±(X, P Y ) = ± N±(X, Y ) = N±(P X, Y ). One can write the Lie-bracket symbol

3.5 Integrability Condition

We shall for the rest of this paper assume that the bosonic and the fermionic dimension are
equal n+ = n−. Thereby we have the odd parity conjugation ∗ available. This ensures that
N+ = 0 ⇔ N− = 0. By the Frobenius Theorem, an almost parity structure is locally a parity
structure if one of the following equivalent integrability criteria is satisﬁed:

1. The Nijenhuis tensor N = 0 vanishes.

2. One of the tensors N± = 0 vanishes.

3. One of the eigenspaces Pσ(T M ) is stabile under the Lie-bracket operation [ , ].

4. ∃σ : The ideal I(η(σ,A)) in the exterior algebra of forms, generated by the characteristic one-

forms for Pσ(T M ), is stabile under the action of the exterior derivative d.

We conjecture that a vanishing Nijenhuis tensor actually ensures that the manifold admits the
parity structure globally. The corresponding statement for bosonic complex manifolds was proven
by Newlander and Nirenberg [9].

4.1 Odd Metric

and

gAB = EAC P C

B = (−1)ǫAǫB gBA ,
2 [E ∨, P ] .

g = 1

ǫ(gAB) = ǫA + ǫB + 1 ,

The symbol ∨ is the super-symmetrized tensor product, dzB ∨ dzA = (−1)ǫAǫB dzA ∨ dzB. The
above symmetry property of g follows from (2.10). The inverse metric satisﬁes

gBA = (−1)(ǫA+1)(ǫB +1)gAB ,

ǫ(gAB) = ǫA + ǫB + 1 .

On the other hand we get

In a P -adapted coordinate system the next-to-last condition simply state that the only non-
vanishing components of the Christoﬀel symbols ΓB
AC are the bose-bose-bose and the fermi-fermi-
fermi components.

Our ﬁrst principle for introducing a connection in anti-symplectic geometry is that it preserves the
anti-symplectic structure:

∇E = 0 ,

tion should be torsion-free. It clearly implies the weaker super-symmetrized condition:

4.3 Levi-Civita Connection

We are led to consider the Levi-Civita connection. It is the unique connection that satisﬁes

T = 0 ,

∇g = 0 ,

(4.22)

where g in principle could be any odd, non-degenerate, symmetric metric. In terms of the Christoﬀel
symbols the metric condition reads

In a P -adapted coordinate system the parity-mixed components of the Christoﬀel symbols ΓD
vanish. The following formulas apply to the non-vanishing components only:

where K is a local parity potential. A connection in the ﬁeld-sector of the ﬁeld-antiﬁeld space
has previously been discussed by Alfaro and Damgaard [10] in the context of BV quantization of
quantum ﬁeld theories using Schwinger-Dyson equations.

4.4 Divergence

We deﬁne the divergence div(X) of a bosonic vector ﬁeld X as

where the contracted Christoﬀel symbols FA for a general connection on the tangent bundle read

div(X) = str(∇(X)) = (−1)ǫA(

→
∂l
∂zA + FA)X A ,

(−1)ǫAFA = ΓB

BA .

FA is not a tensor. From the gauge transformation like property of the Christoﬀel symbols it follows
that under a coordinate transformation zA → z′A(z) the contracted Christoﬀel symbols transforms
as

FA = (

→
∂l
∂zA z′B)F ′

B + (

→
∂l
∂zA ln sdet(

→
∂l
∂z· z′·)) .

11

(4.25)

(4.26)

(4.27)

(4.28)

So ∇F = d + F with F = dzAFA is a connection in the superdeterminant bundle over the manifold.
d − F is a connection in the inverse superdeterminant bundle, or equivalently the bundle of volume
densities. We may form another superdeterminant connection ∇F = d + F = d + dzAFA with
connection ﬁeld

FA = (−1)(ǫA+1)ǫB ΓB

AB .

(4.29)

In the torsion-free case, FA = FA.

In case of the Levi-Civita connection, we can rewrite the contracted Christoﬀel symbols FA as
→
C gBA) = − (−1)ǫC (
∂l

(−1)ǫAFA = − (−1)ǫB gBC (

→
C gCB)gBA .
∂l

(4.30)

Therefore the divergence takes the form

div(X) = − (−1)ǫAgAB(

→
∂l
∂zB (gAC X C)) .

Thus the Levi-Civita divergence

vanishes identically for a vector ﬁeld of the form

div(YF ) = 0

YF = g(F, ·) = g(·, F ) ,

where F is an odd function. However, contrary to even Riemannian geometry where a canonical
volume density is Pf(gAB), a volume density in odd Riemannian geometry is not a function of the
metric gAB. There are Killing symmetries which are not volume preserving. See also the analog
discussion in Section 1.2.

4.5 Odd Laplacian

The odd Laplacian ∆(F ) of an odd function F is [3]

∆(F ) = − 1

where XF = (F, ·) = − (·, F ) denotes the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld for F . We have the following

4.6 Analysis of Odd Laplacian

The odd Laplacian ∆ is a second order operator, or equivalently

where A1, A2 and A3 are functions (i.e. operators of order 0). The supercommutator ∆2 = 1
2 [∆, ∆]
In fact, the Jacobi identity
of the second order operator ∆ is at most of order 2 + 2 − 1 = 3.
guarantees that it is at most of order 2. We can give a proof which does not use of the explicite
form of ∆, but merely that it is of second order and Grassmann-odd. First, note that [11]

[[[[∆, ∆], A1], A2], A3] =

(−1)ǫπ [[∆, [[∆, Aπ(1)], Aπ(2)]], Aπ(3)] = 0 .

(4.40)

Here ǫπ is a Grassmann factor arising when permuting

Xπ∈S3

Recalling that the antibracket can be expressed as a multiple commutator [11]

A1 A2 A3 = (−1)ǫπ Aπ(1) Aπ(2) Aπ(3) .

(A, B) = (−1)ǫ(A)[[

(4.41)

(4.42)

we recognize the right hand side of (4.40) as the Jacobi identity.

to the appropriated space of basemanifold two-forms. The Ricci tensor

is Grassmann odd. The Levi-Civita Ricci tensor Ric vanishes on manifolds which possesses a

is by deﬁnition the curvature two-form for the superdeterminant bundle

R = 1

2 [∇F ∧, ∇F ] = − dzA ∧ dzB(

The Ricci two-form (the ﬁrst Chern class) is closed because of the Bianchi identity. This shows
that on a Ricci-form-ﬂat manifold we can locally ﬁnd a bosonic function ln ρ such that

(4.45)

(4.46)

ρ transforms as a volume density. The ρ is determined up to a multiplicative constant.

4.8 Pseudo Tensors

Let us deﬁne diﬀerentiation operators

˜∂A = (P T )A

B ∂A ,

(∂σ)A = (Pσ)A

B ∂A .

A contravariant pseudo vector ˜X A transforms as

˜X ′B = ˜X A (

→
˜∂A z′B) ,

under change of coordinates zA → z′A(z). An (r, s) pseudo tensor is the obvious generalization.
Pseudo tensors behaves as tensors under parity preserving transformations. With this notation the
Levi-Civita ∆ can neatly be written as

5 Odd K¨ahler Manifolds

5.1 Deﬁnition

An odd pre-K¨ahler manifold (See Section 3.1) is an odd K¨ahler manifold iﬀ its Levi-Civita Connec-
tion ∇ respects the antisymplectic structure, cf. condition (4.16).

For the rest of this Section we consider an odd K¨ahler manifold M . The holonomy group is
G ⊆ GL(n). Also note that the Lie-bracket between a “holomorphic” and an “anti-holomorhic”
vector ﬁeld vanishes. In a P -adapted coordinate system the algebra of canonical vector ﬁelds

→

∂zB ] = cAB
reduces into two independent algebras, i.e. the only non-vanishing components of the structure
functions cAB

5.2 K¨ahler Potential

Note that although a K¨ahler potential K may only be locally deﬁned, the formula (2.19) still holds
for arbitrary P -adapted coordinate systems. In other words, it make sense to view K as a local odd
scalar function. Moreover, the odd Laplacian on K is equal to half the dimension of the manifold:

(∆K) = n .

5.3 Canonical Volume Form
There is a globally deﬁned canonical volume form Ω(M )

vol = d2nz ρ , whose density ρ in a local P -

ρ = det(E ¯αα)

of the purely bosonic matrix

→
∂l
∂θ ¯α K
As a check, note that ρ transforms as a volume density under transformations among P -adapted
coordinates. Let us emphasize that the expression (5.3) does not hold in general coordinates. Now
ﬁx a point m ∈ M in the manifold and consider the two Lagrangian surfaces L± that intersects
m. Contrary to even symplectic geometry the canonical volume form Ω(M )
vol actually induces [5]

we conclude (up to an inessential over-all sign convention) that

ρ+ = ρ ,

ρ− = 1 .

(5.7)

(5.8)

This illuminates one peculiar feature of the canonical Lagrangian densities ρ±: If one for example
performs a coordinate transformation among the purely fermionic coordinates θ → θ′(θ), this has
consequences for the canonical bosonic measure factor ρ+, while the fermionic measure factor ρ−
stays intact.

Theorem. On an odd K¨ahler manifold:

1. The superdeterminant connection ﬁeld is of the form FA = (

measure density.

→
∂l
A ln ρ), where ρ is the canonical

2. The Levi-Civita connection is Ricci-form-ﬂat.

3. The odd Levi-Civita Laplacian ∆ is nilpotent.

Proof: We may choose P -adapted coordinates. Then F (0)
superdeterminant connection ﬁeld FA after some trivial manipulations reads

A vanishes, cf. (4.37). So from (4.38), the

(−1)ǫC FC = (−1)ǫB EBA(

→
∂l
A EBC ) .

(5.9)

16

Note that we only have to sum over index A with Grassmann parity ǫA = ǫC, because we use
P -adapted coordinates. In this case the Jacobi identity is particular simple:

Therefore,

(∂l

[AEC]B) = 0 if ǫA = ǫC .

(−1)ǫC FC = 1

2 (−1)ǫB EBA(EBA

←
∂r
C) .

Statement (1) follows immediately. Statement (2) is a direct consequence of (1). To prove the last
assertion (3), note from expression (4.36), that ∆2 has no monomial with less than two diﬀeren-
tiations when ∆2 is normal-ordered, i.e. diﬀerential operators ordered to the right. But from the
Ricci-form ﬂatness we know that ∆2 is a linear operator. Hence, it is zero.

So the ﬁrst Chern class vanishes automatically for an odd K¨ahler manifold. Let us deﬁne an odd
Calabi-Yau manifold to be a compact odd K¨ahler manifold.

5.4 Odd Symplectic Potential

A common choice of odd symplectic potential ϑ is

Note that the ﬁrst two formulas are covariant. They hold in arbitrary coordinates. So if the K¨ahler
potential K is globally deﬁned, so is the odd symplectic potential ϑ. Another choice is

(xα, xβ) = 0 ,

(xα, ϑβ) = δα

β ,

(ϑα, ϑβ) = 0 .

(5.14)

The super Jacobian of the coordinate transformation is J = det(E ¯αα)−1, so the canonical volume
density in these Darboux variables reads

Hence the ∆ operator becomes

5.5 Fourier Transform

Let there be given a P -adapted bosonic (n|0) Lagrangian surface L in M and a globally deﬁned
K¨ahler potential K. We equip L with the canonical volume density ρL = ρ on L. In a P -adapted
coordinate system, we may write

L = {(xα; θ ¯α)|θ ¯α = θ ¯α

(0)} ,

ρL(x) = det(E ¯αα(x, θ(0)))

(5.20)

We may assume that the local P -adapted charts in the atlas are of the box-type U × IRn
a , where
U ⊆ IRn
c and IRc (IRa) denotes the set of Grassmann-even (Grassmann-odd) real supernumbers,
respectively [12]. In other words, we may assume that the P -adapted fermionic (0|n) Lagrangian
surfaces are covered by a single chart.

L−(x(0)) = {(xα; θ ¯α)|xα = xα

(0)} .

(5.21)

We now deﬁne a Fourier transform ∧ : C∞(M ) → Ω(L) from the space of functions f (x, θ) on M
to the exterior algebra of forms ˆf (x, c) on the Lagrangian surface L.

ˆf (x, c) = ρL(x)

(5.22)

Note that the Fourier transform acts from the right. Here the Grassmann-odd variables cα play
the rˆole of the canonical basis of one-forms dxα, i.e. they transform in the same way with the
form-degree replaced by the Grassmann-degree. In the second equality, we substituted

¯ϑ ¯α = (

(x, θ(0)) .

Clearly ¯θ → ¯ϑ is a bijection, whose inverse we denote by ¯θ = ¯θ(x, ¯ϑ). We have

Note that the fermionic top-monomial

by Fourier transform is mapped to a constant. But the Poincar´e Lemma states that the only
non-trivial local DeRahm cohomology is the constant zero-forms. We therefore have:

Local Cohomology Theorem. Given an odd K¨ahler manifold M with ρ is independent of θ.
Locally, the solutions f to the equation

are of the form

monomial:

Although we shall not use it, let us describe a manifest recipe to obtain Darboux Coordinates with
ρ = 1. The price is of course that P is not diagonal. For this, let us choose symplectic potential ϑ
as

ϑ = ϑAdzA

ϑα = 0

ϑA = (P T

− )A

B(

∂l
∂zB K) ,

ϑ ¯α = −(

∂θ ¯α K).

We now choose Darboux coordinates (ϑ ¯α; θ ¯α)

(ϑ ¯α, ϑ ¯β) = 0 ,

(ϑ ¯α, θ

¯β) = δ

¯β
¯α ,

(θ ¯α, θ

¯β) = 0 .

(5.32)

The super Jacobian of the coordinate transformation (xα; θ ¯α) → (ϑ ¯α; θ ¯α) is J = det(E ¯αα), so the
canonical volume density ρ = 1 is unity.

6 Vielbein Formulation

6.1 Vielbeins

In general, there is no canonical way of introducing an almost parity structure P . We shall see that
a vielbein formulation overcome this diﬃculty.

We consider an (n|n) supermanifold M equipped with an antisymplectic vielbein ea
parity ǫ(ea

A) = ǫa + ǫA, i.e. a diﬀeomorphism

A, of Grassmann

e = ∂r

a ea

A

→
dzA : T M → T W .

Here “w-space” T W = W is an antisymplectic vector space, with a constant almost Darboux metric
a and dual basis for dwa, both of Grassmann parity ǫa, although we
Eab
will not necesseraly give any sense to a wa coordinate. The inverse vielbein map is denoted

(0). We denote the basis ∂r

e−1 = ∂r

A eA

a

→
dwa

: T W → T M .

We have the orthonormality relations

b = δa

A eA
ea
b ,
[e, e−1] = IdT W − IdT M ,

B = δA

a ea
eA
[e, e] = 0 ,

B ,

[e−1, e−1] = 0 .

(6.3)

The antisymplectic structure is given as

EAB = eA

a Eab

E = − 1

B ,

where the supertransposed vielbein eT = dzA (eT )A

a

: T ∗W → T ∗M is

a

Let us also introduce the vielbein one-forms

(eT )A

a = (−1)(ǫa+1)ǫAea

A .

ea = ea

A dzA = dzA (eT )A

a .

We will restrict our attention to vielbein formulations where the vielbeins ∂l(z)
a unit volume-cell of T M (up to a sign):

a = (eT )a

A∂l

A spans

vol(∂l(z)

a

) = ± 1 ,

where “vol” denotes the signed volume of a frame. This is a non-trivial but very reasonable
requirement for a vielbein formulation, thereby linking in a natural way the notion of volume
density and the notion of anti-symplectic metric. A canonical volume density is then given as

ρ = sdet(e) vol

|a = 1, . . . , 2n

= ± sdet(e) .

(6.8)

single-valued.

6.2 Canonical Almost Parity Structure

The manifold possesses a canonical almost parity structure P ,

P A

B = eA

a (−1)ǫa ea

B .

P is compatible with the antisymplectic structure E in the sense of (2.10). In P -adapted coordi-
nates, the vielbein ea

A acquires the block-diagonal form

ea

A 6= 0 ⇒ ǫa = ǫA .

A∂l

a = (eT )a

Moreover, the vielbein ∂l(z)
A separates into “holomorphic” and “anti-holomorhic” direc-
tions for the canonical P -structure. This can be seen by noting that the vielbein is the diagonalizing
transformation in the tangent space T M for the almost parity structure P . A coordinate system
is called a Grassmann preserving coordinate system, iﬀ all the non-vanishing entries of the vielbein
is bosonic. Grassmann preserving coordinates are therefore the same as P -adapted coordinates.
The manifold M is an odd pre-K¨ahler manifold wrt. the canonical almost parity structure P , if it
admits an atlas of Grassmann preserving coordinates.

We may introduce the “ﬂat” bosonic (fermionic) volume factor

σ = vol(∂l(z)
ρ(0)

aσ ) ,

σ = ± 1 ,

spanned by the n bosonic (fermionic) vielbeins ∂l(z)
called special, iﬀ

a

, ǫa = 0 (ǫa = 1), respectively. A vielbein is

vol(∂l(z)

a+ ) vol(∂l(z)

a− ) = vol(∂l(z)

a

) .

For P -adapted coordinates the canonical volume form factorizes. In case of a special vielbein we
may write:

ρ = ρ+ ρ− ,

ρ± = sdet(ea±

A±) ρ(0)

± = det(ea±

A±)±1 ρ(0)
± .

(6.13)

6.3 Gauge Group

There is a structure-preserving gauge group acting on the ﬂat indices of the vielbeins. In other
words, the group is a subgroup of GL(T W ). (We shall be more explicit about the group below).
A group element

Λ = ∂r

a Λa

b

→
dwb

: T W → T W

acts on the vielbein as

ea
a = (e−1)A

A → (Λ.e)a
A
a → ((Λ.e)−1)A

= Λa
a = eA

b eb
A ,
b (Λ−1)b

eA

a .

The group action reﬂects the gauge freedom in choice of vielbein. The above requirement that the
vielbein should represent the volume element reduces the gauge group to the subgroup G whose
elements has superdeterminant ±1. In the light of the canonical almost parity structure P , we
could just as well deﬁne the vielbein map e : T M → T W in terms of the canonical odd metrics

gAB = (eT )A

a g(0)

ab eb

B ,

g = − 1

2 [e ∨, [e ∨, g(0)]] .

(6.16)

(6.9)

(6.10)

(6.11)

(6.12)

(6.14)

(6.15)

21

where as usual the odd metric is

gAB = EAC P C

B ,

ab = E(0)
g(0)

ab (−1)ǫb .

(6.17)

We see that the gauge group G ⊆ GL(T W ) for the ﬂat indices should preserve 1) the anti-symplectic
metric, 2) the metric and 3) the volume up to a sign. This means the group elements Λ ∈ G satisfy

Ead

(0) = Λa

b Ebc

(0) (ΛT )c

d ,

gad
(0) = Λa

b gbc

(0) (ΛT )c

d ,

sdet(Λ) = ± 1.

(6.18)

G is the subgroup of the orthosymplectic group whose elements has superdeterminant ±1. This is
isomorhic to GL(n) ∩ det−1({±1}).

G = Osp(n|n) ∩ sdet−1({±1}) ∼= GL(n) ∩ det−1({±1}) .

(6.19)

To see this, consider the usual Grassmann 2 × 2 block representation of the matrices. Let us ﬁx
notation

0 ≤ det(λ)2 = sdet(Λ) = ± 1 ,

so the N × N bose-bose block λ has determinant

det(λ) = ± 1 .

Hence we have a non-rigid GL(n) ∩ det−1({±1}) gauge symmetry in each point. We see that the
bosonic and the fermionic volume factors ρ(0)
σ is preserved up to a sign under gauge transformation.
+ ρ(0)
And the product ρ(0)

− is invariant.

6.4 Levi-Civita Connection

Having a canonical odd metric g at our disposal, we can construct the Levi-Civita connection

∇Γ = d + Γ : T M × T M → T M ,

where

Γ = dzA ∂r

dzC = ea ∂r(z)

In the second equality of (6.26), we used the symmetry property (4.12) between the lower indices
of the Levi-Civita Christoﬀel symbols. The upper ﬂat index is lowered with the ﬂat metric:

ab = (−1)ǫagdc

Γd
Γc,ab = (eT )c

(0) Γc,ab ,
C ΓC,BA eA

a eB

b(−1)ǫaǫB .

We stress the fact that the ﬂat Christoﬀel symbols depend on the choice of the curved coordinate
system. To facilitate writing down the formulas we will introduce short hand notation for the
c, γabc and aabc,
most common combinations of vielbeins. We introduce structure functions fa
mutually related as indicated below:

2Γc,ab = (−1)ǫcǫaγa{cb} + (−1)ǫb(ǫa+ǫc)γb{ca} − γc{ab}

−γcab − (−1)ǫaǫbγcba .

If M is an odd K¨ahler manifold wrt. the canonical P -structure, the only non-vanishing components
of the raised Christoﬀel symbols Γb
ac are the pure bosonic and the pure fermionic components. We
assume for the rest of this paper condition (4.16).

6.5 Jacobi Identity

Certain (partially) antisymmetrized versions of the above mentioned structure functions are in-
dependent of the curved coordinate system that was used to deﬁne them in the ﬁrst place. We

In case of P -adapted curved coordinates in an odd K¨ahler manifold, the structure functions fab
has only “holomorphic” and “anti-holomorhic” components. To see this, ﬁrst note that this is

coordinates, it follows from the very deﬁnition of the structure functions, cf. (6.20), that

We obtain the claim by combining these arguments.

6.6 Spin Connection

A = dzA ∂r

b Ab

Ac

dwc = ea ∂r

It is assumed that A does not depend on the choice of the curved coordinate system. Of course,
the full connection is ∇ = d + Γ + A, where Γ is the Levi-Civita Christoﬀel symbols. The spin
connection acts trivially on objects that carry no ﬂat indices. The torsion two-form

The curvature is

R = 1

2 [∇ ∧, ∇] = 1

2 [∇Γ ∧, ∇Γ] + 1

2 [∇A ∧, ∇A] = RΓ + RA .

The Bianchi identity is a trivial consequence of the supercommutator version of the Jacobi identity:

6.8 Levi-Civita Spin Connection

As in the usual bosonic case we deﬁne the Levi-Civita spin connection to be the unique spin
connection that satisﬁes

T = 0 ,

∇g(0) = 0 .

(6.56)

The last equation yields

Abac + (−1)ǫbǫc+ǫa(ǫb+ǫc)Acab = 0 .
Together with the condition of no torsion, this implies that the Abac can be expressed purely in
terms of the structure functions ab[ac]:

(6.57)

2Abac = −(−1)ǫaǫbaa[bc] − (−1)ǫc(ǫa+ǫb)ac[ba] − ab[ac]

= (−1)ǫb(ǫa+ǫc)aacb − (−1)ǫaǫbaabc

+(−1)ǫaǫb+ǫaǫc+ǫbǫcacab − (−1)ǫc(ǫa+ǫb)acba
+(−1)ǫaǫcabca − abac .

Evidently, Abac does not tranform under change of the curved coordinate frame. On the other hand
we can construct a spin connection by conjugating with the vielbein

∇A

X = e ∇Γ

X e−1 .

It satisﬁes (6.56), so it is the Levi-Civita spin connection. It follows that

Γb,ac = Abac + abac ,

Ab

ac − Γb

ac = (−1)ǫb(ǫa+ǫc)+ǫcfac

b = − (−1)ǫbǫafa

c .

Conjugation with vielbeins does not change the curvature:

RA ∼= RΓ .

Here we have identiﬁed the w-basis with the vielbein-basis.

(6.53)

(6.54)

(6.55)

(6.58)

(6.59)

(6.60)

(6.61)

From the conjugation formula (6.59) it follows that the Levi-Civita spin connection respects the
ﬂat antisymplectic structure ∇E(0) = 0 and the ﬂat canonical almost parity structure ∇P (0) = 0,
where P (0)a

b . Explicitly, the condition ∇P (0) = 0 reads

b = (−1)ǫa δa

ǫb = ǫc ⇒ Abac = 0 .

(6.62)

26

This condition is of course completely superseded, if we furthermore assume that the manifold
M is an odd K¨ahler manifold wrt. the canonical P -structure. Then only the bose-bose-bose and
the fermi-fermi-fermi components of Ab
ac survive. This follows from arguments similar to those
presented in Section 4.2 for a tangent bundle connection ∇Γ, which yields the analogous conclusion
for the Christoﬀel symbols Γb
ac. Or one could use the relation (6.60) and the fact that the structure
functions fa

c has also only “holomorphic” and “anti-holomorphic” components.

A Super conventions

Derivatives have two kinds of attributes. First, a superscript “r” or “l” indicates a left or right
derivative

Secondly, arrows indicate, on which objects the derivatives should act. The derivatives is uniquely
speciﬁed through its action on the fundamental variables

∂zA = (−1)ǫA ∂r
∂zA .

∂l
∂zA zB) = δB

(

A = (zB

←
∂r
∂zA ) .

If a derivative carries no arrow it does not act on anything present in the formula. It is then merely
understood as the natural basis for the tangent space in the sense that we are only interested in
immitating its transformation properties under change of coordinates.

Note that this deﬁnition is stabile under change of coordinates as it should be. The contraction iX
with a bosonic vector ﬁeld X, ǫ(X) = 0,

iX = X A il

A = ir

A X A

is deﬁned via its action on the natural basis of one-forms

(−1)ǫA

A (dzB) =

A (dzB) = δA

In fact, we can symbolically write

p(d) = 1 = p(iX ) .

Both the exterior derivative d and the contraction iX carries odd “form-parity”

The wedge ∧ will in this respect be a total redundant symbol, i.e. for two forms ω and η

In the same spirit we deﬁne the supercommutator [A, B] of two operators A and B to be

ω ∧ η = (−1)ǫ(ω)ǫ(η)+p(ω)p(η)η ∧ ω .

[A, B] = AB − (−1)ǫ(A)ǫ(B)+p(A)p(B)BA

For instance

d2 = 1

2 [d, d] = 0 ,

[iX , iY ] = 0 ,

LX = [iX , d] .

The van der Waals atom-surface attraction, scaling as C3 z-3 for z the atom-surface distance, 

is expected to be valid for ~ 1-1000 nm, covering 8-10 orders of magnitudes in the interaction 

energy. Thanks to a Cs vapor nanocell, we analyze the spectroscopic modifications induced 

by  the  atom-surface  attraction  on  the  6P3/2→6D5/2  transition.  The  C3  value,  extracted 

independently  for  various  thicknesses  ranging  from  40  nm  to  130  nm,  is  found  to  be 

independent  of  the  thickness.  It  agrees,  but  only  within  a  factor  of  2,  with  an  elementary 

theoretical prediction, whose validity is discussed.

The dipole-induced dipole attraction between neutral bodies is a key phenomenon in 

the  ultimate  cohesion  of  matter  and  is  at  the  origin  of  covalent  crystals  and  van  der  Waals 

molecules. This van der Waals (vW) type of attraction between fluctuating atomic dipoles is a 

precursor of the general Casimir interaction [1], whose paramount importance in the quantum 

theory of vacuum has been recognized recently, encompassing effects related to the need of a 

"cosmological constant" in general relativity theory, and speculations about the detection of a 

possible fifth force. The interest for the measurement of the Casimir effect has been largely 

renewed  with  the  recent  upsurge  of  precision  experiments  [1,2],  whose  interpretation  now 

requires  to  take  into  account  various  corrections  such  as  the  non-ideality  of  the  materials, 

surface  roughness,  and  non-zero  temperature  corrections.  Simultaneously,  the  knowledge  of 

the  vW  attraction  between  atomic  particles,  spanning  as  -C6r-6  (with  r  the  interatomic 

distance),  now  appears  as  a  fundamental  need  to  predict  the  collisional  behavior  of  a 

collection  of  atoms  [3],  ultimately  connected  to  the  possibility  for  cold  atoms  to  condense 

according to a Bose-Einstein statistics. Between these two related fundamental problems, an 

intermediate situation is provided by the atom-surface vW interaction, predicted to span as -

C3z-3  (z:  the  atom-surface  distance).  The  C3  value  can  usually  be  predicted  through  an 

electrostatic  mirror  image  approach,  satisfactory  in  many  cases,  and  with  the  knowledge  of 

atomic structures. The z-3 dependence is expected to be valid for distances allowing to ignore 

the  structural  details  of  the  surface  (typically  ≥ 1  nm),  up  to  the  micrometric  range,  when 

retardation effects impose the more complete Casimir-Polder description [4].  

It  remains  fascinating  to  note  that,  although  the  vW  z-3  attraction  law  should  cover 

about  8-10  orders  of  magnitude  of  energy,  little  has  been  done  to  test  this  predicted 

dependence  in  an  effective  situation.  The  various  developments  in  nanotechnologies  and 

nanosciences should make it more important to measure effectively these remote forces, as for 

the Casimir force already known to be a possible limiting factor in MEMS technology [5]. In 

 

3

the  shorter  distance  limit,  the  vW  attraction  is  only  an  asymptotic  "long-range"  tail  of  the 

atom-surface  potential,  to  the  exact  shape  of  which  surface  physics  experiments  are 

insensitive  [6].  For  the  longer  distances,  and  after  pioneering  principle  experiments  using 

deflection  of  an  atomic  beam  [7],  precision  experiments  tested  the  spatial  dependence  on  a 

beam  of  Rydberg  atoms  [8]  channeled  between  two  plates  separated  by  500  nm  at  least. 

Following the recent blossom of experimental measurements of vW interaction exerted on a 

long-lived  level  [9],  the  spatial  dependence  of  vW  interaction  between  a  ground  state  Cs 

atom,  and  a  metal  surface,  was  very  recently  investigated  in  the  20-100  nm  range[10]. 

Spectroscopy  at  an  interface,  in  which  we  have  been  involved  for  a  long  time[11],  offers  a 

unique  capability  to  probe  the  vW  interaction  for  short-lived  excited  states,  possibly 

exhibiting exotic behaviors such as vW repulsion [12]. However, reflection spectroscopy in a 

macroscopic  cell  probes  a  fixed  vicinity  from  the  surface.  Here  we  report  on  a  method  of 

spectroscopy  in  a  vapor  cell  of  a  nanometric  thickness  ("nanocell")  [13],  that  allows  us  to 

explore the thickness dependence of the vW interaction in the range d = 40-130 nm.  

Following  the  development  of  extremely  thin  vapor  cells,  specific  features  in  linear 

spectroscopy  were  demonstrated  [13],  including  Doppler-free  properties  under  normal 

incidence.  and  an  intimate  mix-up  of  absorption  and  reflection  signals[14]  through  intrinsic 

Fabry-Perot  effects.  However,  transmission  (ST)  and  reflection  (SR)signals  are  derived  from 

independent spatial integrations of the (complex) resonantly induced oscillating atomic dipole 

response  p(z).  This  dipole  response  p(z)  is  naturally  sensitive  to  the  detuning  between  the 

excitation  frequency  and  the  atomic  resonance  (e.g.  through  a  resonant  Lorentzian  response 

[γ/2 +i(ω-ω0(z))]-1,  with  γ  the  optical  width,  ω  the  incident  frequency,  and  ω0(z)  the  vW 

shifted  atomic  resonance).  The  dipole  response  p(z)  is  usually  nonlocal  [14],  owing  to  the 

transient atomic behavior over the wall-to-wall trajectories. This implies a complex interplay 

between the atomic response, the spatial dependence of the vW potential, the natural width, 

 

4

the  Doppler  broadening,  and  the  pressure  effects  (broadening  and/or  shift).  Hence,  the 

expectation of a 1/d3 dependence of the line-shift (relatively to the bulk resonance) is satisfied 

only for a beam of atoms flying at mid-distance from the two windows (see e.g. [8]). For a 

gas  cell,  the  vW  shift,  minimal  at  z = d/2,  is  spatially  inhomogeneous,  and  the  lineshapes 

undergo  severe  distortions  and  asymmetries  along  with  a  vW  broadening.  In  this  sense,  the 

observation of an elementary 1/d3 dependence of the position of the peak of ST(ω) [15] is not 

a  sufficient  evidence  of  the  vW  dependence.  Fig.  1  shows  anyhow  that  when  the  vW 

interaction  dominates  over  other  causes  of  broadening,  the  spectral  shift  varies  with  an 

approximate 1/d3 dependence, making the 40-130 nm range sufficient (for our parameters) to 

explore a factor ≥ 30 in the energy of surface interaction. In a complete calculation [16], we 

have  evaluated  the  theoretical  lineshapes  ST  and  SR  for  a  real  gas,  including  atomic  motion 

and  multiple  electrostatic  images  for  the  vW  potential  (actually,  the  difference  with  an 

elementary  two-wall  potential,  i.e.  V(z)  = - C3[z-3 + (d-z)-3],  does  not  exceed  5  %  when  the 

dispersive properties of the dielectric windows [12] are neglected). The comparison between 

the experimental lineshapes and the theoretical ones is the core of the present work. 

Our  experiments  were  conducted  on  the  6P3/2→6D5/2  transition  of  Cs  (917  nm) 

(requiring a simultaneous pumping on the at 852 nm D2 resonance 6S1/2→6P3/2/ at 852 nm). 

The vW shift of the transition mainly originates in the vW interaction exerted onto the high-

lying  6D  level  [12],  and  the  explored  distance  range  makes  it  dominant  over  other 

broadenings.  The  6D5/2  sublevel  was  chosen  because  it  does  not  exhibit  strong  resonances 

with  the  YAG  windows  of  the  nanocell.  Because  the  thickness  of  a  nanocell  varies  locally 

[13], investigation of various spots in it, under unchanged experimental conditions, is a way 

to  monitor  the  influence  of  the  thickness.  The  local  thickness  d  is  determined  in  a  two-

wavelength reflection measurement (auxiliary He-Ne, and 852 nm beam) [13]. The accuracy 

(1-5nm) notably depends on the local window parallelism at the considered spot. ST and SR 

 

5

spectra are simultaneously recorded, and thicknesses d = 40 nm, 50 nm, 65 nm, 80 nm, 100 

nm  and  130  nm  were  analyzed.  An  auxiliary  917  nm  saturated  absorption  (SA)  signal  in  a 

macroscopic cell provides a frequency reference for the transition in the bulk. For each spot, 

in an approach analogous to the one developed in [12], several temperature conditions were 

investigated. This allows a consistent extraction of the C3 measurement in which the influence 

of Cs pressure is removed. Similarly, a variety of pumping conditions was explored to assess 

the spatial homogeneity of the 6P3/2 population, as our modeling assumes a homogeneous and 

thermal population of atoms. 

The analysis relies on fittings of the experimental spectra with the family of C3 curves 

calculated  for  a  given  thickness  d.  The  strong  constraints  on  the  vW  shift  and  lineshape 

restrict  to  a  narrow-range  the  C3  values  providing  a  satisfactory  (least-square)  fitting.  The 

dominant  vW  spatial  broadening  makes  fittings  nearly  insensitive  to  the  adjustment  of  the 

width of the optical transition. The main results of our systematic analysis are two-fold : (i) 

for a given experiment, ST and SR signals are consistent in shape [17] and amplitude as well 

[18];  this  consistency  is  quite  remarkable  because  it  appears  in  spite  of  independent 

determinations for the fitting, and of unrelated lineshapes; (ii) as a key evidence of the vW z-3 

behavior,  the  optimal  fitting  C3  values  are  found  to  be  independent  of  the  thickness  (fig.2). 

One  observes  an  accurate  convergence  to  a  ~  7.5  kHz.µm3  value  for  small  thickness.  The 

larger  uncertainty  (  ±  2  kHz.µm3)    appearing  for  d ≥ 80nm,  when  the  vW  shift  is  not  very 

large, mostly originates in the choice of an appropriate SA reference. Indeed, the D2 pumping 

in the nanocell may induce an unbalanced, but hard to control, population of  the various 6P3/2 

hyperfine  sublevels  (h.f.s.  up  to  450  MHz).  An  additional  illustration  of  the  overall 

consistency  obtained  in  the  fittings  is  provided  in  fig.3,  where  spectra  recorded  at  various 

thicknesses in otherwise identical conditions are all fitted with a single set of parameters. The 

residual  slight  discrepancies  that  can  be  observed  appear  only  because  of  the  choice  of  a 

 

6

unique  set  of  fitting  parameters,  and  disappear,  with  no  increase  in  the  C3  uncertainty,  with 

more individual adjustments. 

Notwithstanding  the  excellent  agreement  between  the  experimental  data  and  the 

theoretically modeled curves, some reproducibility issues are worth being discussed. Indeed , 

the measured thickness averages over the laser spot (diameter ~ 100 µm) a local nanometric 

wall-to-wall distance d, sensitive to local surface roughness (estimated to 1-2 nm) and defects 

in planarity or parallelism (the minimal observed slope of  the nanocell is ~ 10 nm for 1mm 

[13]).  This  may  result  in  variations  of  the  observed  vW  interaction  for  comparable  spots  as 

<d>-3 ≠ <d-3>.  Testing  the  reproducibility  is  also  a  way  to  monitor  the  influence  of  local 

residual stray electric fields at the surface: it was indeed recognized in [8] that imperfections 

of  the  metal  coatings  are  sources  of  a  Stark  shift  competing  with  the  vW  interaction  for 

excited Cs levels such as Rydberg levels. Stronger residual fields are expected for a dielectric 

window. Static charges and random distribution of crystalline domains have been apparently 

responsible for erratic signals [19] in an experiment derived from [8] but with an atomic beam 

channeled  between  dielectric  walls.  Here,  the  nanocell  technology  allows  the  comparison 

between  experiments  supposed-to-be  identical  with  respect  to  the  nominal  (average) 

thickness, instead of averaging over the whole length traveled by the atomic beam [8], or on a 

large  spot  size  as  with  bouncing  of  cold  atoms  [10].  We  have  observed  a  perfect  spectral 

reproducibility for the various investigated spots with d ≥ 65 nm. At d = 50 nm, several spots 

-but  not  all  of  them-  are  found  to  produce  rigorously  identical  spectra:  they  are  those  here 

analyzed, as apparently immune to random defects -e.g. roughness, local Stark shifts- of the 

surface. For d = 40 nm, sensitive variations are observed from spot to spot. However, except 

for a few erratic behaviors clearly out of the considered family of lineshapes, imperfections in 

the reproducibility have not prevented us from the possibility of a fitting for individual spot, 

as exemplified in fig.3. Remarkably, for these small thicknesses that induce a very strong vW 

 

7

interaction, minor changes in the fitting parameters suffice to interpret visible variations in the 

lineshapes.  Hence,  we  estimate  that  the  major  causes  of  irreproducibility  are  connected  to 

uncertainties, at the level of a few nm, in the local geometry of the two planar windows, rather 

than to the effect of stray fields. 

It  is  also  worth  comparing  our  estimated  C3  value  (~  7.5  kHz.µm3)  to  theoretical 

predictions,  yielding  for  a  Cs  atom  in  front  of  a  single  ideal  reflector:  C3(6D5/2) =  24 

kHz.µm3,  C3(6P3/2) = 4  kHz.µm3,  and  in  front  of  a  YAG  window  [20]  :  C3

YAG(6D5/2) = 17 

kHz.µm3, C3

YAG (6P3/2) = 2 kHz.µm3. This leads for our spectroscopic experiment [i.e. C3 = 

C3(6D5/2) - C3(6P3/2)]  to  a  predicted  C3 value  ~15  kHz.µm3,  a  value  about  twice  larger  than 

found in our experiments. Several reasons are susceptible to explain this slight discrepancy:  

(i)  on  the  experimental  side,  the  modeling  assumes  the  initial  level  to  be  populated  in  a 

spatially  uniform  manner  and  with  a  thermal  velocity  distribution.  This  may  be  not  totally 

valid  for  an  initial  level  such  as  the  resonant  6P3/2  level,  that  has  required  a  prior  pumping 

that could be more efficient for the slowest atoms. However the quality of the fittings, and the 

relative  insensitivity  of  the  vW  shift  to  the  velocity  distribution  (see  fig.  1),  show  that  the 

discrepancies with the assumptions of the model should remain of a modest influence. 

(ii)  On  the  theoretical  side,  the  evaluation  of  the  dielectric  image  factor  applicable  to 

Cs(6D5/2) is delicate [20]: even for a single wall, it requires a precise knowledge of the YAG 

spectrum  and  of  its  surface  modes,  notably  in  the  ~15µm  region,  where  a  virtual  emission 

couples  Cs(6D5/2)  to  7D.  Moreover,  in  a  nanocell  [21],  the  coupling  is  actually  between 

atomic transitions and a guided mode structure: the elementary two-wall model, or the refined 

multiple  electrostatic  images  model,  may  become partly  improper  to deal  with the resonant 

couplings occurring through the dispersive properties of YAG.  

(iii)  In  the  standard  theoretical  evaluation,  an  equal  contribution  of  the  dipole  fluctuations 

along  the  normal,  and  parallel  to  the  interface  is  assumed.  However,  because  the  D2  line 

 

8

pumping laser is polarized parallel to the surfaces –near normal incidence irradiation- , and 

with the polarized excitation of the 917 nm laser, the preparation of Cs (6D5/2) atoms in the 

nanocell  is  most  probably  non-isotropic  with  respect  to  the  various  Zeeman  sub-states. 

Hence,  the  summing  over  the  virtual  dipole  transitions  connecting  the  6D5/2  level  may  be 

restricted  to  some  directions  only.  This  would  reduce,  by  up  to  a  factor  of  ~2  [21],  the 

observable value of C3.  

In conclusion, linear spectroscopy in a nanocell has enabled us to demonstrate the z-3 

shape of the vW potential, in a distance range (40-130 nm) for which the energy shift spans 

from ~150 MHz to ~5 GHz (for 2 walls) and covers a factor ~30. In spite of negligible stray 

fields, the experimental C3 value is found in discrepancy with an elementary prediction. This 

should impulse more elaborate theoretical developments. The rich physics of the interaction 

with dielectric media, including a possible resonant coupling with surface modes, can also be 

addressed  with  our  technique.  More  generally,  the  distances  investigated  here,  falling  an 

order of magnitude below those explored years ago for excited atoms in Rydberg levels [8], 

compares favorably with the range currently investigated in precision Casimir measurements 

[2] and in the recent vW interaction experiments with ground state atoms [10]: the vW shift 

observed in nanocells is indeed equivalent to the one for a single wall at ~ 0.3 d  (see fig.1). 

Moreover, for short distances, vW measurements based upon the reflection of slow atoms [9-

10]  are  intrinsically  limited  by  the  considerable  forces  needed  to  equilibrate  the  vW 

attraction,  and  the  current  atomic  force  microscopy  techniques  developed  for  the  

measurement  of  Casimir  interaction  would  hardly  be  compatible  with  a  high  pressure  (the 

standard  calculation  predicts  a  Casimir  interaction  exceeding  the  atmospheric  pressure  for 

d ≤ 10  nm).  In  contrast,  nanocell  spectroscopy  appears  feasible  for  even  smaller  nanocell 

thickness  (d ~20-30  nm  is  reported  in  [15]).  Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  vW  strength  is 

huge at small distances (from our experiments, the atomic acceleration 20 nm away from one 

 

9

of the wall can be estimated  to ~ 4.107 g) and may induce a gradient of density for the atomic 

gas in the extreme vicinity with the surface, and that more generally, the very short distance 

regime of Casimir-related interaction remains under debate [22].

Gravity is here quantized starting from the generalization of the action function. This leads to
an equation of correlation between gravitational and inertial masses, which depends on the
particle's  kinetic  energy.  However  we  shown  that,  in  spite  of  the  gravitational  and  inertial
masses  are  not  necessarily  equivalents,  there  is  a  renewal  of  the  strong  equivalence
principle  and    consequently  the  Einstein's  equations  are  preserved.  In  fact  such  equations
are deduced here directly from this Kinetic approach to Quantum Gravity. Moreover, we have
obtained a generalized  equation for  inertial  forces,  which  incorporates  the  Mach's  principle
into  Gravitation.  Also,  we  have  deduced  the  equation  of  Entropy;  the  Hamiltonian  for  a
particle  in  an  electromagnetic  field  and  the  reciprocal  fine  structure  constant.  All  deduced
directly  from  the    theory  for  Quantum  Gravity.  This    new    approach  will  allow  us  to
understand some crucial matters in Quantum Cosmology.

1. INTRODUCTION

to 

of 

the 

          Quantum  Gravity  was  originally
studied,  by  Dirac  and  others,  as  the
problem 
quantizing  General
Relativity.  This  approach  has  many
difficulties, detailed by Isham [1]. In the
1970's  physicists  tried  an  even  more
conventional  approach:  simplify 
the
Einstein's equations by pretending that
they  are  almost  linear,  and  then  apply
the standard methods of quantum field
thus-oversimplified
theory 
equations. But this method, too, failed.
In the 1980's a very different approach,
known  as  string 
theory,  became
popular.  For  a  while  there  are  many
enthusiasts  of  string  theory.  But  the
mathematical  difficulties        in        string
theory      are  formidable,  and  it  is  far
from  clear  that  they  will  be  resolved
any  time  soon.  At  the  end  of  1997
Isham 
several
pointed 
"Structural  Problems  Facing  Quantum
Gravity Theory".  At  the  beginning   of
this   new  century,    the    problem   of

out 

[2] 

quantizing  the  gravitational        field
was    still  open.
          In  this  work  we  propose  a  new
approach  to  Quantum  Gravity  where
gravity  is  quantized  starting  from  the
generalization  of  the  action  function
for a particle. The  Einstein's  equations
of  the  General  Relativity  are  deduced
directly  from  this  theory  of  Quantum
Gravity.  Also,  it  leads  to  a  complete
description  of 
the  Electromagnetic
Field, providing a consistent unification
of gravity with electromagnetism.

1. THEORY

          We    start  with  the  action  for  a
free-particle that, as we know,  is given
by:

a

  which

always positive for all the particles.

          In  Relativistic  Mechanics, 
action  can  be  written  in  the  following
form [3]:

          In  Classical  Mechanics 
the
Lagrange's  function  for  a  free-particle
2aV
is,  as  we  know,  given  by: 
where    V   is  the  speed  of  the  particle
and    a   a  quantity    hypothetically  [4]
given by :

L =

ﬁc

2ma =
where    m   is  the  mass  of  the  particle.
However,  there is no distinction about
the kind of mass ( if gravitational mass,
gm , or inertial mass, 
im  ) neither about
its  sign ( )–
.
          The  correlation  between  a   and
a
  can  be  established  based  on  the
fact    that  on  the  limit   
  the
relativistic  expression  for    L     must  be
the  classic  expression
reduced 
L =
2aV
.
c
Therefore, 
  we  obtain
L =
2aV
  must  be  always
          Since 
2a=
positive,  the  quantity 
  must
also  be  always  positive.  Hence,  a
rigorous  mathematical  definition    of  a
must  be  expressed  as  function  of  m
instead  of    m .  Moreover,  we  must

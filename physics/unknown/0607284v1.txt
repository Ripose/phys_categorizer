Abstract

Crystal  lattice  can  trap  and  channel  particle  beams
along major crystallographic directions. In a bent crystal,
the  channelled  particles  follow  the  bend.  This  makes  a
basis for an elegant technique of beam steering by means
of bent channelling crystals, experimentally demonstrated
from  3  MeV  to  1  TeV.  This  technique  was  strongly
developed  in recent  studies  at  CERN,  FNAL,  IHEP,  and
BNL,  and  can  lead  to  interesting  applications  also  at  the
LHC,  such  as  crystal  collimation  making  a  collider
cleaner  by  an  order  of  magnitude.  We  review  recent
developments in the field and show outlook for the future.

INTRODUCTION
The  idea  to  deflect  proton  beams  using  bent  crystals,
originally  proposed  by  E.N.  Tsyganov  in  1976  [1]  and
demonstrated first in Dubna [2] on protons of a few GeV,
has received strong development since then [3-6].

Leaving  aside  the  details  of  channeling  physics,

in  a 

accelerator physicist will find many familiar things here:
•  Channeled  particle  oscillates 

transverse
nonlinear field of a crystal channel, which is similar to
the betatron oscillations in accelerator, but on a much
different scale (3 µm wavelength at 1 GeV in Si ).
•  The  crystal  nuclei  arranged  in  crystallographic
planes represent the "vacuum chamber walls". Notice
the "vacuum chamber" size of ~2 Angstroms.

•  The  well-channeled  particles  are  confined  far  from
nuclei  (from  "aperture").  They  are  lost  then  only  due
to
to  scattering  on  electrons.  This 
"scattering on residual gas".

is  analogy 

•  Like  the  real  accelerator  lattice  may  suffer  from
errors  of  alignment,  the  real  crystal  lattice  may  have
dislocations too, causing particle loss.

•  Accelerators  tend  to  use  superconducting  magnets.

Interestingly, 
temperatures are more efficient, too [7].

THE EXPERIMENTS AT CERN SPS

Important milestone in 1991 was a bending experiment
on  H8  beam  at  CERN  where  crystal  bent  first  10%  [8]
and later up to 60% [6,9] of all beam incident at crystal -
orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  any  previous  figure
(<<1%  typically),  Fig.  1.  The  experiment  continued  [6]
with  many  crystal  types  and  particle  species:  protons,
pions, and ions of high energy, and lead to application for
beam splitting in the K12 beam for NA48 at CERN [10].
Next  major  milestone  was  a  crystal  experiment  on
proton  extraction  from  the  SPS  [11-13].  For  the  first
time,  extraction  efficiency  was  measured  as  10%,  again

The  SPS  studies  helped  a  lot  in  understanding  crystal
extraction.  In  the  framework  of  SPS  studies,  computer
simulations  from  the  first  principles  gave  an  adequate
prediction  for  the  experiments.  Simulations  [14-16]  of
extraction process included multiple encounters with the
crystal, and turns in the accelerator, of the beam particles.
Tracking of particle through a bent crystal lattice requires
not  only  a  calculation  of  a  particle  dynamics  in  its
nonlinear field, but also a generation of random events of
scattering on the crystal electrons and nuclei [17].

Figure 2. The angular scan of extraction with a U-shaped
crystal [18]. Predicted (1993) and measured (1994).

Simulation  results  were  found  consistent  with  the
observations  in  the  assumption  of  a  few-µm  surface
irregularities  (`septum  width')  that  suppress  channelling
on the first pass in crystal. Another SPS experiment used
a crystal with an amorphous layer at the edge to suppress
channeling  in  the  first  passage  [12].  The  extraction
efficiency with this crystal was indeed of the same order
of magnitude as found without an amorphous layer, thus
confirming  the  expectation  [14-15].  Further  extraction
studies [12,13] at the SPS continued with crystals of new
geometry  (``U-shaped'').  Fig.  2  [18]  shows  the  first
measured [19] angular scan (70 µrad FWHM) of crystal
extraction, in agreement with prediction [14].

The dependence of crystal extraction on proton energy
was measured at the SPS with the same crystal [13], Fig.
3.  This  behaviour  was  well  understood  in  simulations

[16,20].  This  function,  and  even  the  absolute  figures  of
efficiency of multi-pass extraction, can be understood in
the  framework  of  analytical  theory  of  crystal  extraction
[21]; its predictions are shown in Fig. 3.

from  another
the  absolute  efficiency 
shows  also 
simulation [16], predicting just 15% rise The same Figure
shows the SPS data with a 4-cm crystal [12].

Similarly,  for  the  Tevatron  E853  experiment  it  was
found  that  extraction  efficiency  could  be  increased  to
~70% with a crystal length cut to 0.4-1 cm [15,25].

Figure  3  Extraction  efficiency  vs  proton  momentum.
Analytical theory (o) and SPS data (crosses).

More  bending  and  extraction  experiments  at  CERN
SPS were done with Pb ions of highest energy, up to 400
GeV/u  [6,22].  These  studies  have  shown  that  crystal
technique  is  fully  applicable  to  heavy  ions.  Extraction
efficiency observed at CERN SPS with ions was 4-11%.
For the lifetime of crystal, CERN experiment [6] with
450 GeV protons showed that at the achieved irradiation
of  5·1020  proton/cm2  the  crystal  lost  only  30%  of  its
deflection  efficiency,  which  means  about  100  years
lifetime in the intense beam of NA48 experiment.

THE TEVATRON EXPERIMENT
The Tevatron E853 extraction experiment has provided
another check of the technique at a much higher energy of
900  GeV.  During  the  FNAL  test,  the  halo  created  by
beam-beam interaction in the periphery of the circulating
beam  was  extracted  from 
the  beam  pipe  without
measurable  effect  on  the  background  seen  by  the
experimental detectors. The crystal was channeling a 900-
GeV  proton beam  with  an  efficiency  of 25-30%  [23,24],
showing  a  rather  good  agreement  with  the  theoretical
expectation.  Simulation  predicted  the  efficiency  of  35%
for a realistic crystal in the Tevatron experiment [25].

Apart  from  observing  the  channeled  particles,  this
experiment  has  measured  also  the  particles  dechanneled
from  the  crystal,  appearing  as  a  tail.    The  number  of
particles in the visible tail was measured 20% of the peak
[23]. A simulation of the experiment predicted 25% [25].

IDEAS FOR EFFICIENT CHANNELING
The  crystal  length  used  in  the  SPS  and  Tevatron  was
optimal to bend protons with a single pass. The efficiency
of the multi-pass extraction is defined by the processes of
channeling,  scattering,  and  nuclear  interaction  in  the
crystal, which depend essentially on the crystal length L.

in  a  strongly  bent  crystal 

In  order  to  let  the  circulating  particles  encounter  the
crystal many times and suffer less loss in the crystal, one
can  minimise  crystal  length  to  a  limit  set  by  channeling
physics 
[26,27].  This
optimisation was studied in simulations in general and for
the  experiments  at  SPS  and  Tevatron  [15].  Fig.  4  shows
that efficiency in SPS at 120 GeV more than doubles [14]
at  a  new  optimum,  L≈0.7  cm,  w.r.t.  a  4  cm  crystal.
Predicting  this  boost  in  efficiency  was  not  trivial:  Fig.  4

Simulations (1998, 1993) and measurement (1995).

THE IHEP EXPERIMENTS
Since  1989,  IHEP  Protvino  pioneered  a  wide  practical
use  of  bent  crystals  as  optical  elements  in  high-energy
beams  for  beam  extraction  and  deflection  on  permanent
basis  [28].  In  1997,  a  new  extraction  experiment  was
proposed [29] aiming to benefit from very short crystals.
Monte Carlo study predicted that crystal can be cut down
to ~1 mm along the 70-GeV beam in the extraction set-up
of  IHEP.  This  promised  tremendous  benefits:  crystal
extraction  efficiency  could  be  over  90%.  Fig.  5  shows
both the predicted [30] extraction efficiency as a function
of 
length,  and  some  history  of  IHEP
measurements since 1997 [31,32].

protons. IHEP measurements and Monte Carlo prediction.

Compared  to  the  SPS  and  Tevatron  experiments,  the
efficiency is improved by a factor of 3-8 while the crystal
size along the beam cut by a factor of 15-20 (from 30-40
to 2 mm). It took years in IHEP, and the decisive step was
invention of strip-type deflectors [32], very short–down to
~2  mm  along  the  70-GeV  beam.  This  lead  to  dramatic
boost in crystal efficiency. Now crystal systems extract 70
GeV protons from IHEP main ring with efficiency of 85%
(defined as the ratio of the extracted beam to all the beam

loss in the ring) at intensity of 1012. Today, six locations

collimation.  There,  a  bent  crystal  is  upstream  of  a
secondary collimator. Fig. 6 shows the radial distribution
of protons measured on the collimator face. It includes the
peak  of  channeled  particles  bent  into  the  depth  of  the
collimator, and the scattered particles near the edge.

At 1.3 GeV with the same crystal, crystal collimation is
still  quite  strong,  Fig.  6,  although  the  energy  is  lowered
by two orders of magnitude. The same set-up  was  tested
in a broad energy range in the main ring of U-70. Fig. 7

Thermal shock is an issue important for application. In
typical IHEP tests, crystal channeled ~1012 protons (up to
4·1012 in some runs) in a spill of 0.5-1 s duration. Let us

illustrate  it  in  the  following  way.  Suppose,  all  the  LHC
store of 3·1014 protons is dumped on our single crystal in
a  matter  of  0.2  hour  [33].  This  makes  a  beam  of  4·1011
proton/s incident on the crystal face. In IHEP, this is just
routine  work  for  a  crystal,  practiced  every  day.  IHEP
experience  can  help  broad  crystal  application  to  beam
optics even at high-intensity machines, e.g. J-PARC [34].

RHIC CRYSTAL EXPERIMENT
Another experiment on crystal collimation was done at
the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider  [35-36].  The  yellow
ring of the RHIC had a bent crystal collimator of the same
type  as  used  in  earlier  IHEP  experiments  [31],  5  mm
along the beam. By aligning the crystal to the beam halo,
particles  entering  the  crystal  were  bent  away  from  the
beam  and  intercepted  downstream  in  a  copper  scraper.

The  efficiency  is  defined  as  maximum  depth  of  the
large  dip  divided  by  the  background  rate.    For  the  2003
RHIC run, the theory predicted the efficiency of 32%, and
the averaged measured efficiency for this run is 26%. The
modest  figure  of  efficiency  ~30%,  both  in  theory  and
experiment, is attributed to the high angular spread of the
beam that hits the crystal face as set by machine optics. It
is worth to compare the efficiency for Au ions at RHIC to
the  40%  efficiency  achieved  with  similar  crystal  for
protons  at  IHEP  in  1998  [31].  Extraction  efficiency
observed at CERN SPS with Pb ions was 4 to 11% with a
long  (40  mm)  crystal  [22].  The  RHIC  study  was
demonstration of world first crystal collimation for heavy
ions, with efficiency record high for ions.

TEVATRON SIMULATIONS
A  possibility  to  improve  the  Tevatron  beam  halo
scraping using a bent channelling crystal instead of a thin
scattering  target  as  a  primary  collimator  was  studied  at
FNAL  [37]  with  realistic  simulations  using  the  CATCH,
STRUCT and MARS Monte Carlo codes.

It  was  shown  that  the  scraping  efficiency  can  be
increased  by  an  order  of  magnitude.  As  a  result,  the
beam-related  backgrounds  in  the  CDF  and  D0  collider
detectors can be reduced by a factor of 7 to 14. Calculated
results on the system performance taking into account the

thickness  of  near-surface  amorphous  layer  of  the  crystal
are presented in Table 1. Two cases have been compared:
1.  The Tevatron RUN-II collimation system with all
secondary  collimators  in  design  positions,  but  only
one (D17h) horizontal primary collimator in working
position.    This  primary  collimator  intercepts  large
amplitude  protons  and  protons  with  positive
momentum deviations.

2.  The  same  collimation  scheme,  but  silicon  bent

crystal is used instead of primary collimator.

SIMULATIONS FOR THE LHC
We evaluated the potential effect of crystal collimation
in the LHC using the same computer model [38] already
validated  with  the  IHEP,  CERN,  FNAL,  and  BNL
experiments on channeling. Simulations were done in the
LHC  both  at  the  collision  energy  of  7  TeV  and  at  the
injection  energy  of  450  GeV  for  a  nominal  beam
emittance  of  3.75  µm  (at  1  σ,  defined  as  r.m.s.).  In  the
model, a bent crystal was positioned as a primary element
at a horizontal coordinate of 6σ in the LHC halo, on one
of  the  locations  presently  chosen  for  amorphous  primary
elements of the LHC collimation design [39].

We varied crystal parameters such as the size, bending,
alignment angle, material, and  the  quality  of  the surface.
We  observed  the  efficiency  of  channeling,  i.e.,  the
number of the particles deflected at the full bending angle
of the crystal, taking into account many turns in the LHC
ring and multiple encounters with the crystal. On the first
encounter,  the  halo  particles  entered  the  crystal  face
within  ≤1  µm  from  the  edge.  The  first  1-µm  thick  near-
surface layer of the crystal was assumed amorphous.

Fig. 10 shows the computed channeling efficiency as a
function of the crystal length along the LHC beam for two
cases: at flattop (7 TeV) and at injection (450 GeV). The
optimal  size  of  the  silicon  crystal  is  about  5  mm  for  0.1
mrad,  and  just  3  mm  for  0.05  mrad.  High  efficiency  of
channeling  can  be  obtained  with  the  same  (optimized)
crystal  both  at  7  TeV  and  at  450  GeV.  The  efficiency  is
expected  to  be  90-94%  in  the  case  of  crystal  bending
angle of 0.05-0.1 mrad.

Different bending angles were examined (finding every
time  the  optimal  size  for  the  crystal)  and  the  channeling
efficiency  computed,  Fig.  10.  If  all  channeled  particles
were  fully  intercepted  by  the  secondary  collimator,  then
only  non-channeled  particles  should  contribute  to  the
background in the accelerator. Fig. 10 data means that the
halo intensity can be reduced by a factor of 10-25. All the

range  of  crystal  deflector  size  assumed  in  Fig.  10  is
already realised and tested by IHEP in 70 GeV beam.

Figure 10. Channeling efficiency in LHC vs crystal length
(left) and bending (right).

The  optics  of  traditional  collimation  and  technical
considerations  may  require  primary  scrapers  of  different
material.  The  technique  of  bent  crystal  channeling  is
developed  also  with  other  materials,  e.g.  Ge  (Z=32)  [6]
and  diamond  (Z=6).  In  simulations  [39],  comparable
efficiencies were obtained with Ge, Si, and diamond at 7
TeV. All these crystals, from diamond to germanium, can
serve as an LHC primary scraper. Another interesting (but
futuristic)  possibility  might  be  the  use  of  nanostructured
material [40].

Figure  11.  Channeling  efficiency  vs  crystal  orientation
angle (left) and crystal surface roughness (right).

For efficient operation, crystal must be oriented parallel
to  LHC  beam  envelope  within  ~1  µrad,  Fig.  11.  We
studied  also  the  effect  of  crystal  surface  in  simulations,
Fig.  11.  With  surface  level  better  than  0.1  µm,  the
computed efficiency exceeds 97%.

Apart  from  collimation,  more 

interesting  crystal
applications are proposed for the LHC, e.g. for CMS and
ATLAS calibration by the primary beam of LHC [41].

STUDIES OF CRYSTAL COLLIMATION
AT THE TEVATRON AND CERN SPS
High  expectations  for  crystal  collimation  at  TeV
colliders stimulated new experiments at the Tevatron and
SPS.  The  O-shaped  crystal  tested  in  RHIC  was  installed
in  the  Tevatron  and  tried  at  980  GeV  in  a  collimation
experiment. Fig. 12 shows the crystal  nuclear  interaction
rate measured (dots) and simulated as a function of crystal
orientation  [42].  The  plot  shows  a  dramatic  dip  due  to
channeling with very  high  efficiency.  The  measurements
and simulations are in good agreement.

A striking feature of the plot is a plateau with the width
equal  to  the  crystal bending  angle, 0.44  mrad,  where  the
interaction  rate 
that  at  random
is  about  50%  of 
orientation.  Simulation  [43]  identified  the  plateau  as  a

strong effect of beam coherent scattering (“reflection”) in
a  field  of  bent  crystal.  The  effect  of  beam  “volume
reflection”  in  bent  crystals,  Fig.  13  (a),  was  predicted  in
1987  [44].  Crystal  collimation  [35,42,43]  gave  the  first

Figure 12. Crystal collimation at 1 TeV.
A new deflector from IHEP, strip-type of 3 mm length
and 0.15 mrad bend, is now installed into Tevatron for a
collimation  test.  Simulation  predicts  a  plateau  0.15  mrad
wide,  with  rate  suppressed  by  65%  w.r.t.  the  random
orientation. At the dip,  the  new  crystal  should produce  a
background lower than the O-crystal does, by a factor of
1.5-2 because of channeling with higher efficiency.

Tevatron  tests  of  crystal  collimation  will  provide  the
best opportunity for validation of the technique; however,
lots of new information can be gained from the tests in the
SPS.  A  new  experiment  at  CERN  SPS  [45]  aims  to
measure  directly  for  the  first  time  a  reflection  angle  of
400  GeV  protons  in  a  bent  crystal.  Fig.  13(b)  shows  the
predicted  distribution  downstream  of  the  crystal  in  the
SPS  beamline:  96%  of  the  beam  is  reflected  with  (most
probable) angle of 13 µrad.

Carlo  model  successfully  predicts  crystal  work 
in
circulating beam, as demonstrated in experiments at up to
1  TeV.  The  same  crystal  works  efficiently  over  full
energy  range,  from  injection  through  ramping  up  to  top

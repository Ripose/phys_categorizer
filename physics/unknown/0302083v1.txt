It is shown, that the introduction in Saint-Venant -Wantzel's formula radicand of the free compo-
nent in the form of quadrate of velocity of the incident gas flow on inlet of flowing element that 
was offered in the end of the XIX century and is remained till now it is physically inadequate. It is 
shown that this way is doubtful for hydromechanics and it absolutely isn't reasonably for gasdy-
namics.  Physically  exact  form  of  writing  of  static  head  law  for  flowing  element  and  relevant  to 
this, the modern form of Saint-Venant - Wantzel's formula are submitted ad-hoc. The obtained ex-
pressions allow physically correctly to take into account both combined and isolated influence of 
pressure drop applying to the flowing element and velocity of incident gas flow on flowing ele-
ment, on quantity of the outflow velocity of gas stream out of this flowing element, system. The 
obtained expressions are valid for a subsonic velocity of the incident gas flow. The particular ex-
pressions are obtained for liquid.

1 Introduction 
 
The  problem  solution  on  the  combined  action  of 
pressure  drop  applying  to  the flowing element and 
velocity  of  incident  flow  on  the  inlet  of  flowing 
element  is  general  problem  for  description  of  the 
gas and liquid flow motion. 
This  problem  was  solved  in  hydromechanics  by 
introduction  in  the  radicand  of  the  Torricelli-
Galilei-Borda-Du  Buat  (TGBD)  formula  of  free 
component  in  the  form  of  velocity  quadrate  of  the 
incident  flow  on  the  inlet  of  the  flowing  element 
[1].  Thus,  the  first  component  of  radicand  of  the 
TGBD  formula  allows  for  pressure  drop  applying 
to  the  flowing  element,  the  second  component  al-
lows for the incident flow velocity on flowing ele-
ment  and  then  the  square  root  from  this  total  with 
allowance for the velocity coefficient determins the 
flow rate of fluid on outlet of the flowing element. 
The  circumscribed  formula  exists  in  such  form  in 
hydromechanics  from  the  beginning  of  the  ХIX 
century till now. In the end of the ХIX century, this 
way  was  transferred  into  gasdynamics:  the  free 
component in the form of velocity quadrate of inci-
dent  gas  flow  on  the  inlet  of  the  flowing  element 
was  also  brought  into  the  radicand  of  the  Saint-
Venant - Wantzel formula (SVW) [2,3]. The veloc-
ity coefficient is present in the front of root in this 
case  as  well  as  in  hydromechanics.  The  empirical-
speculative character of the circumscribed approach 
is obvious in hydromechanics and especially in the

The law of static head for the liquid stream in flow-
ing  element,  with  taking  into  account  that  the  ex-
pression  for  the  velocity  head  of  incident  liquid 
flow has the same form as for gas flow, looks like:

during  the  outflow  of  liquid  stream  to  an  atmos-

We  is  obtaining  "flying  pipe"  variant  at  activity  of 
the  velocity  of  the  incident  flow  alone  on  inlet  of 
the  flowing  element  and  in  absence  of  pressure 
drop.  For  this  case,  the  law  of  static  head  has  the 
appearance of:

gasdynamics.  For  example,  if  only  the  velocity  of 
incident gas flow ("flying pipe" version) acts on the 
inlet of the flowing element without pressure drop, 
the outlet velocity out of the flowing element with-
out  of  account  of  the  velocity  coefficient  will  be 
equal to velocity of incident flow. In this case, the 
strange  situation  is  arisen: the friction does not in-
fluence  upon  the  moving  gas  stream  in  flowing 
element.  This  is  not  the  gas  stream,  this  is  physi-
cally empty medium under title an ideal fluid. The 
problem  is:  how  does  the  given  situation,  with  a 
stale more than 175 years, to solve physically ade-
quately and mathematically definitely? 
 

2 Approach 
 
The overcoming of the problem of contact interac-
tion  of  fluid  medium  with  streamline  surface  has 
allowed  to  find  the  unitized  expression  for  alloca-
tion of static head of the gas or liquid stream along 
the length of flowing element in the form of law of 
static head [4, 5]. Side by side with it SVW formula 
was also led to the final physically correct form [6]. 
If  these  expressions  have  the  property  of  adequate 
reflection  of  a  physical  reality,  then  they  should 
allow  to  take  into  account  all  multiplicity  of  me-
chanical  actions  on  fluid  stream.  Including,  they 
should  allow  to  take  into  account  the  combined 
action  of  pressure  drop  and  velocity  of  incident 
flow on the flowing element and moreover without 
any  tales  like  of  the  velocity  and  flow  rate  coeffi-
cients and polytrope [7] and other well-known “bet-
terments.” 
 

3 Solution 
 
Despite of the brevity of the approach, the solution 
of  the  problem  appears  rather  simple.  There  is 
enough, the velocity head of incident flow on inlet 
of  the  flowing  element  to  add  to  p0  in  the  law  of 
static head and the solution is reached.  

So, velocity head of incident flow:

4 Final remarks 
 
Thus,  the  problem  about  the  physically  adequate 
and  mathematically  precise  taking  into  account  of 
influence of velocity of incident gas flow on outlet 
velocity  is  resolved  for  two  practically  important 
cases:  a  combined  action  of  pressure  drop  and  ve-
locity  of  incident  gas  flow  and  isolated  action  of

velocity  of  incident  gas  flow.  The  particular  solu-
tions are given for fluid flow

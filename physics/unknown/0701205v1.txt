ABSTRACT 

Systematic  investigations  of  137Cs  and  134Cs  activity  concentrations  in  potatoes 
(Solanum  tuberosum)  for  the  post-Chernobyl  period  (1986-2005)  in  the  Republic  of  Croatia 
are summarized. The correlation between 137Cs activity concentrations in fallout and potatoes, 
has been found to be very good, the correlation coefficient being r2=0.88 with P(t) < 0.001 for 
18  degrees  of  freedom.  As  the  radiocaesium  levels  in  potatoes  decreased  exponentially,  the 
mean  residence  time  of  137Cs  in  potatoes  was  estimated  by  fitting  the  measured  activity 
concentrations to the exponential curve. The mean residence time was found to be 6.8 ± 1.1 
years, the standard deviation being estimated by the Monte Carlo simulations. 

The  initial  observed  134Cs:137Cs  activity  ratio  in  potatoes  has  been  found  to  be  quite 
variable,  but  slightly  lesser  than  theoretically  predicted  value  of  0.5,  calculated  by  applying 
the  known  inventory  of  these  radionuclides  in  the  Chernobyl  reactor  to  the  equation  for  the 
differential radioactive decay. This can be explained by presence of the pre-Chernobyl  137Cs 
in soil that originated from nuclear fallout.  

The  annual  effective  doses  received  by  134Cs  and  137Cs  intake  due  to  consumption  of 
potatoes estimated for an adult member of Croatian population were found to be very small, 
as the per caput dose for the entire 1986 – 2005 period was calculated to be about 2.9 µSv, 
134Cs  accounting  approximately  for  1/3  of  the  entire  dose.  Therefore,  after  the  Chernobyl 
accident  consumption  of  potatoes  was  not  the  critical  pathway  for  human  intake  of 
radiocaesium from the environment in Croatia.

INTRODUCTION 

Tests  of  nuclear  weapons  conducted  in  the  atmosphere  and  releases  of  radioactive 

material  from  nuclear  facilities  are  the  main  causes  of  the  man-made  radioactive 

contamination  of  human  environment.  Once  released  to  the  atmosphere,  long-range 

atmospheric  transport  processes  can  cause  a  widespread  distribution  of  such  radioactive 

matter, although it may, like in the case of Chernobyl accident, originate in a single point on 

the  Earth’s  surface.  The  resulting  fallout,  consisting  of  short  and  long-lived  radionuclides, 

eventually  affects  humans,  either  directly  or  indirectly  by  entering  the  food  chain  through 

consumption  of  plants  and  animals.  In  both  cases  fallout  causes  a  health  hazard  to  the 

population through the direct irradiation and consumption of contaminated foodstuffs. 

Due  to  a  comparatively  high  contribution  of  the  ingestion  doses  to  the  total  dose 

received  by  population  after  the  exposure  to  nuclear  fallout,  a  reliable  prognosis  of  the 

expected ingestion doses is of utmost importance. The ingestion dose strongly depends on the 

consumption  of  various  types of foodstuffs, and related activity concentrations of respective 

radionuclides  in  those  foodstuffs,  which  themselves  usually  depend  upon  the  transfer  from 

fallout.  In  addition,  a  reliable  prediction  of  the  expected  ingestion  dose  received  by 

consumption of a particular foodstuff requires the detailed knowledge of decreasing behaviour 

of activity concentrations in the environment and respective foodstuffs. 

Among  man-made  radioactive  nuclides,  those  of  the  radiocaesium,  particularly  137Cs, 

are  regarded  as  a  great  potential  hazard  to  living  beings.  Namely,  this  fission  product  has 

unique  combination  of  relatively  long  half-lives  (30.14  years)  and  chemical  and  metabolic 

properties resembling those of the potassium, which is principal constituent of cell tissue. 

Investigations  of  the  distribution  and  fate  of  natural,  nuclear  weapons  produced  and 

reactor-released radionuclides in foodstuffs have been conducted as a part of an extended and 

still  ongoing  monitoring  programme  of  radioactive  contamination  of  human  environment  in 

Croatia. (Popović at al. 1966 – 1978, Bauman et al. 1979 – 1992, Kovač et al. 1993 – 1998 

and  Marović  et  al.  1999  –  2005).  However,  the  regular  investigations  of  radioactive 

contamination  of  potatoes  (Solanum  tuberosum)  have  started  in  the  year  of  the  Chernobyl 

accident, i.e. in 1986. 

The annual production of potatoes in Croatia is about 550,000 tonnes annually (Central 

Bureau of Statistics, 2004). Approximately 1/3 of this quantity is being consumed in Croatia. 

Since  the  population  of  Croatia  is  about  4.5  million  of  inhabitants,  the  consumption  rate  of 

potatoes  is  approximately  40  kg  per  person  annually.  Therefore  it  can  be  regarded  as  quite 

 

2

important  foodstuff  in  Croatia  which  can  have,  if  contaminated,  severe  radiological 

consequences for the entire population. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Potatoes have been obtained commercially on civil markets in the cities of Zagreb (45° 

50' N, 16° 00' E), Osijek (45° 30' N, 18° 40' E) and Zadar (44° 06' N, 15° 15' E). From each 

site  were  obtained  several  kilograms  of  potatoes  that  were  first  peeled  of  and  then  cut  into 

small pieces in order to obtain the composite sample. Samples were dried in an oven and then 
ashed in a muffle furnace at 450 oC for 24 h.  

Fallout  samples  were  collected  monthly  in  the  city  of  Zagreb  at  the  location  of  the 

Institute  for  Medical  Research  and  Occupational  Health  (45°  50'  07.3" N,  15°  58'  58.7" E). 
The  funnels,  which  were  used  for  rainwater  collection,  had  a  1 m2  catchment  area. 

Precipitation  height  was  measured  by  Hellman  pluviometer.  Rainwater  was  evaporated  to 
volume of 1 L in order to enrich the 137Cs activity concentration. 

 
A  gamma-ray  spectrometry  system  based  on  a  low-level  ORTEC  Ge(Li)  detector 
(FWHM 1.87 keV at 1.33 MeV 60Co and relative efficacy of 15.4% at 1.33 MeV), coupled to 

a  computerized  data  acquisition  system,  was  used  to  determine  radiocaesium  levels  in  the 

samples  from  their  gamma-ray  spectra.  Ash  from  the  samples  was  measured  in  cylindrical 

plastic containers of appropriate volume, which were placed directly on the detector. Fallout 

samples were measured in Marinelli beakers. Counting times, which depend on radiocaesium 

activity concentrations in samples, ranged from 10,000 to 250,000 seconds and typically were 

80,000 s. 

 

Quality  assurance  and  intercalibration  measurements  were  performed  through 

participation  in  an  International  Atomic  Energy  Agency  (IAEA)  and  World  Health 

Organization  (WHO)  international  intercalibration  programmes,  which  also  include  the 

regular performance of blank, background and quality control measurements. 

Radiocaesium activity concentrations in samples in this paper are reported as averages 

of  three  sampling  locations,  implicitly  implying  similar  characteristics  and  microclimate 

conditions, of soils in which potatoes have been grown, that is not necessarily true. However, 

typical  relative  error  was  about  25 %.  It  should  be  noted  that  similar  approach  has  been 

implemented  in  the  radioecological  investigations  of  contamination  of  diet  components  in 

Nordic countries (Strandberg, 1994 and Aarkrog, 1994).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

137Cs and 134C activity concentrations in potatoes 

 

The  radioactive  fallout  resulting  from  large-scale  nuclear  weapon  tests  in  the 

atmosphere  conducted  in  the  1960s,  followed  by  similar,  but  smaller  scale  tests  by  the 

Chinese and French in the 1970s and afterwards, was the dominant route for the introduction 

of  artificial  radionuclides  in  the  environment  until  the  nuclear  accident  at  Chernobyl,  in 

former USSR, on 26 April 1986. Fortunately, due to the prevailing meteorological conditions 

at  the  time  after  the  accident  that  influenced  the  formation  and  spreading  direction  of 

Chernobyl  plumes,  Croatia  was  only  on  the  North-Western  region  partially  affected  by  the 

edge of one of the plumes (UNSCEAR, 1988). 

The estimated amount of radiocaesium released after the reactor explosion at Chernobyl 
was 3.7 × 1016 Bq of 137Cs (13% of total reactor inventory) and 1.9 × 1016 Bq of 134Cs (10% of 

total reactor inventory (International Atomic Energy Agency, 1986). Thus, the initial value for 
the 134Cs:137Cs activity ratio in May 1986 was 0.51. 

The  highest  observed  137Cs  activity  concentrations  in  fallout  were  recorded  in  May 
1986, resulting in 6410 Bqm-2 for the surface deposit by fallout in the year 1986 (Bauman et 

al.  1979  –  1992;  Franić  1992).  The  radioactive  material  introduced  to  the  atmosphere  by 

Chernobyl  accident  was  by  global  dispersion  processes  distributed 

throughout 

the 

troposphere, causing the increased radiocaesium activity concentrations in the environment in 
years to come. However,  137Cs showed a significant exponential decrease over time because 
of natural removal as well as radioactive decay. Also, no new releases of 137Cs occurred after 

the  Chernobyl  reactor  accident  either  from  nuclear  facilities  or  nuclear  weapons  testing. 
Therefore, in 2005 total 137Cs surface deposit by fallout was only 2.8 Bqm-2. 

The  highest  137Cs  activity  concentration  in  potatoes,  being  1.100  ±  0.650  Bq kg-1  was 
recorded in 1986, while in 2001 was recorded minimal value of only 0.033 ± 0.011 Bq kg-1, 
the 137Cs activity concentration in 2005 being 0.055 ± 0.023 Bq kg-1. The transient increase of 
137Cs  activity  concentration  in  year  1990  could  be  explained  by  penetration  of  caesium  to 

deeper  soil  layers  as  root  uptake  by  plants  of  radionuclides  as  well  as  other  stable  elements 

depends upon their vertical distribution. It should be noted that these activity concentrations 

4

are comparable to the values observed elsewhere (Tsukada and Nakamura 1999, Schwaiger et 

al. 2004). 

When discussing  134Cs activity concentrations, it should be noted that  134Cs and  137Cs, 

being  the  most  conservative  in  behaviour,  have  undergone  no  selective  removal  in  transit 

between the accident site at Chernobyl and Croatia as their activity ratio value of 0.5, found in 

various samples taken on the accident site, has not been altered as this ratio has been found in 

most of the environmental samples in Croatia (Franić et al 1988; Franić et al 1992a; Franić et 
al 2006). However, the initial observed 134Cs:137Cs activity ratio in potatoes has been found to 

be  quite  variable,  but slightly lesser than 0.5. This can be explained by presence of the pre-
Chernobyl  137Cs in soil that originated from nuclear bomb fallout. Consequently,  134Cs:137Cs 

activity concentration ratio found in potatoes resembled that found in Chernobyl fallout. 

Mean residence time of 137Cs in potatoes 

A  reliable  prediction  of  the  expected  ingestion  dose  received  by  consumption  of  a 

particular  foodstuff  requires  the  detailed  knowledge  of  decreasing  behaviour  of  activity 

concentrations in the environment and respective foodstuffs. To evaluate the decrease activity 
concentrations and to assess the effective mean residence time (i.e., ecological time) of  137Cs 

in potatoes the observed data were fitted to the exponential function:  

Apot(t)  = Apot(0) e – kt 

/1/

where: 

Apot(t) 

is time-dependant activity concentration of 137Cs in potatoes (Bqkg-1), 

Apot(0) 

initial activity concentration of 137Cs in potatoes (Bqkg-1) and  

1/k=TM  effective (observed) mean residence time of 137Cs in potatoes (years). 

By  fitting  the  data  for  137Cs  activity  concentration  in  potatoes  to  the  function  /1/ 

(r = 0.88  with  P(t) < 0.001 for 18 degrees of freedom) the effective mean residence time for 
137Cs in potatoes, for the overall observed post-Chernobyl period (1986 – 2005) was estimated 

to be 6.8 years. This value is in excellent agreement with effective mean residence time of 6.7

" 1.3 y (effective half-life is 1688 " 338 days) reported for potatoes in Austria (Schwaiger et 

al 2004), and similar to mean residence time for the other foodstuffs (Schwaiger et al 2004). 

The fit is shown on Figure 1. 

FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE 

However,  to  find  the  real  residence  time,  TR,  the  observed  constant  k  should  be 

corrected for the radioactive decay. Therefore constant k from the equation /1/ can be written 

k = 8 + kR 

/2/

where ln(2)/8 = 30.14 y is the physical half-life of 137Cs. 

From equation (3) real mean residence time for  137Cs in potatoes, TR = 1/kR, was found 

to be 8.0 y, which is about one year higher compared to the effective mean residence time TM. 

In  order  to  obtain  the  standard  deviation  of  TM,  Monte  Carlo  simulations  were 

performed.  To  be  on  a  conservative  side,  as  well  as  to  simplify  calculations,  the  uniform 
distribution  has  been  assumed  over  the  A ± 2F  value  of  137Cs  activity  concentrations  in 

potatoes  for  respective  years,  although  normal  would  be  more  realistic.  For  each  year  the 

random value was generated over the interval [A - 2F, A + 2F] and then from such set of data 

was estimated the 1/k value by fitting to the equation /1/. The process has been repeated 500 

times and 500 values for 1/k = TM were obtained. From such set of data the mean value and 

standard deviation for TM were calculated to be 6.8 " 1.1 years. 

137Cs transfer from fallout to potatoes 

The  intensity  of  transfer  processes  that  lead  from  emission  of  radionuclides  to  the 

biosphere  to  their  concentrations  in  physical  environment,  living  organisms  and  finally  to 

humans is dependant on various parameters and factors inherent to the different environments, 

i.e., compartments of the biosphere. These parameters and factors determine the behaviour of 

radionuclides  and  eventually  the  response  of  the  environment.  One  of  the  tools  that  help  to 

as:

compare  sensitivities  of  various  environments  to  radioactive  contamination,  at  least  to  some 

extent, is radioecological sensitivity. 

Radioecological  sensitivity,  Rs,  is  defined  as  the  infinite  integral  of  activity 

concentrations  of  particular  radionuclide  in  an  environmental  sample  to  the  integrated 

deposition. Rs is sometimes also called the transfer coefficient from fallout to sample and in 

the  case  of  food samples is equivalent  to  UNSCEAR’s transfer coefficient  P23 (UNSCEAR, 

1982). Mathematically, P23 is defined as follows:

where: 

A(t) 

is the activity of given radionuclide in food, i.e., potatoes (Bq kg-1) and 

U& (t) 

the fallout deposition rate of this radionuclide (Bq m-2

 y-1). 

As  for  values  of  A(t)  and  U& (t)  assessed  on  the  yearly  basis  the  integration  can  be 

replaced by summation, for the overall observed period, i.e. from 1986 to 2005, the value of 
P23  for  137Cs  in  potatoes  can  be  easily  calculated  to  be  4.85  × 10-4  Bq y kg-1  /  Bq m-2.  That 

means that with each Becquerel deposited on an area of one square metre of soil by fallout, 

the activity of one ton of potatoes increases approximately by 0.5 Bq.  

However, as in the year 1986 was very high direct 137Cs deposition, it affects the overall 
result. Therefore, when the year 1986 is excluded from analysis, P23 for 137Cs in potatoes for 
1987 – 2005 period is calculated to be 1.47 × 10-3 Bq y kg-1 / Bq m-2. 

  To put the obtained values into perspective, the  137Cs transfer coefficient P23 for total 
diet  was  estimated  to  be  approximately  1.2 × 10-2  Bq y kg-1/(Bq m-2) for  the  1962 - 1979 
period in New York (reference location for a northern hemisphere) and 8.0 × 10-3 Bq y kg-1 / 
Bq m-2 for the 1963 - 1973 period in Argentina (southern hemisphere) (UNSCEAR, 1982). 

Also, for 137Cs in wheat grains for 1965 to 2003 period, the value of P23 was estimated 
to be 8.59 × 10-3 Bq y kg-1 / Bq m-2  (Franić et al 2006). However, when wheat data for pre-

7

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Chernobyl  and  post  Chernobyl  periods  have  been  considered  separately,  P23  values  of 
2.79 × 10-2 and 5.11 × 10-3 Bq y kg-1 / Bq m-2 were obtained for 1965 - 1985 and 1986 - 2003 

periods respectively.  

Modelling 137Cs activity concentrations in potatoes 

In  1990  and  afterwards,  contamination  of  potatoes  by  the  fallout  134Cs  that  originated 

from the Chernobyl nuclear accident was detectable only at a very low level. 

 137Cs  activity  concentrations  in  potatoes  are  in  good  correlation  with  fallout  activity 

when  related  by  a  simple  linear  relation,  with  coefficient  of  correlation  r = 0.88  with 

P(t) < 0.001 for 18 degrees of freedom. Thus, for the observed period, i.e. from 1986 – 2005, 
137Cs activity concentrations in potatoes can be from fallout data modelled as:  

Apot(t) = 0.00015 ×Afall(t) + 0.14078 

/4/

is 137Cs activity concentration in potatoes (Bq kg-1) and 

137Cs fallout activity (Bq m-2). 

By  plotting  the  observed  (measured)  137Cs activity concentrations data in potatoes and 

data modelled using the equation /4/ against the time scale, it is clear that the fit overestimates 

the real data ever since year 1995. 

a power function: 

The better fit is obtained when 137Cs activity concentration data in potatoes are fitted to 

Apot (t) = 0.06  Afall (t) 0.317

For  equation  /5/  coefficient  of  correlation  between  observed  and  modelled  137Cs 
 
activity concentrations data in potatoes is 0.88.  137Cs activity concentrations data and models 

/4/ and /5/ are shown on Figure 2.

It  should  be  noted  that  above  models,  showing  mere  functional  dependence,  are  just 
simple tools for rough prediction of  137Cs activity concentration data in potatoes from fallout 

data and have no deeper physical meaning. 

The chain model for the transfer of 137Cs from fallout to potatoes 

The  activity  concentrations  of  137Cs  in  potatoes  have  been  related  to  the  fallout 

deposition  rates  in  a  general  regression  model  recommended  by  UNSCEAR  (UNSCEAR,

is the activity concentration of observed radionuclide in food (potatoes) in the 
year i, the unit for A(i) being Bq kg-1, 

the fallout deposition rate of radionuclide in year i (Bq m-2

the mean residence time of 137Cs in potatoes and, 

the  factors  which  are  derived  from  reported  data  by  regression  analysis.  The 
unit is Bq y kg-1/(Bq m-2). 

The  equation  /6/  assumes  the  chain  model  for  the  transfer  of  radionuclides  between 

environmental  compartments,  linking  the  input  to  the  atmosphere  to  the  dose  in  man,  the 

successive  compartments  being  atmosphere,  Earth's  surface,  diet  and  tissue.  The  physical 

meaning  of  terms  in  model  /6/  is  as  follows:  the  first  term  (rate  factor)  describes  a  direct 

deposition and transfer, the second term (lag factor) describes contamination through fallout 

from  previous  year,  and  the  third  term  (land  factor)  reflects  the  contamination  from  fallout 

deposition  accumulated  from  all  preceding  years,  the  exponential  describing  the  combined

The 137Cs activity in potatoes and the fit obtained by equation /6/ are shown in Figure

The model prediction describes the real situation quite satisfactory; the coefficient of 

correlation between observed and modelled data being 0.93. 

Regression  analysis  for  the  constant  µ gives  the  value  of  0.165  y-1.  The  reciprocal 
 
value of the constant µ, being 6.0 y, is the observed mean residence time of available 137Cs in 

potatoes and is just slightly lesser than the value predicted by equation /1/. Using equation /2/, 

effective ecological half-live is calculated to be 7.0 years. 

The  factors  b1,  b2,  b3  were  estimated  to  be  1.26×10-4,  9.00×10-6  and  5.96×10-5 
respectively.  The  relative  contribution  of  each  of  three  factors  to  the  modelled  data  of  137Cs 

activity concentration in potatoes obtained by equation /6/ varies from year to year, strongly 

depending upon the fallout deposition rate, the rate factor being the most important in the year 

in  which  the  major  contaminations  occurred  and  the  lag  factor  in  the  couple  of  following 

years. Therefore, in the events like the Chernobyl accident, the season of the year is the key 

factor influencing the radioactive contamination of crops and determining the transfer to man. 

Luckily, the Chernobyl accident happened at a time when direct contamination of leafy parts 

of potato plants was not so important. 

As  stated  previously,  for  values  of  A(t)  and  U(t)  assessed  on  the  yearly  basis  the 

integration  can  be  replaced  by  summation.  By  implementing  that,  the  combination  of 

equations /3/ and /6/ leads to another relation for the radioecological sensitivity:

Equation  /7/  shows  that  radioecological  sensitivity,  i.e.  the  transfer  coefficient  from 
fallout  to  sample  itself  also  consists  of  three  factors.  P23  for  137Cs  in  potatoes  utilizing 
equation  /7/,  i.e.,  after  regression  analysis,  was  estimated  to  be 4.66×10-4 Bq y kg-1 /  Bq m-2, 

10

which is just slightly lesser than the value of P23 calculated directly by the equation /3/ after 

the  summation  of  potatoes  activity  concentration  and  fallout  deposition  rates  for  the  whole 

observed period. 

 

By function minimization of experimental data on 137Cs in soil (Popović, 1966 - 1978; 

Bauman  et  al.,  1979  -  1992;  Kovač  et  al.,  1993  -  1998;  Marović  et  al.,  1999  -  2004)  to 

exponential function, it can be shown that the caesium migration to deeper soil layers is very 

slow process and that half-depth of radiocaesium penetration in uncultivated (i.e. undisturbed, 

non arable soils) is just few centimetres, which is well established fact (Szerbin et al., 1999; 

Isaksson  et  al.,  2001).  Therefore,  most  of  the  caesium  activity  is  found  in  the  first  few 

centimetres of soil. In arable, i.e. cultivated soils, caesium  consequently penetrates in deeper 

layers.  Nevertheless,  potatoes  are  not  so  much  affected  by  caesium  accumulated  in  soils, 

which results in relative minor contamination. 

Dosimetry 

Data on activity concentrations of  137Cs and  134Cs in potatoes allow for the estimate of 

the doses incurred by their consumption. Dose conversion factors, i.e. effective dose per unit 
intake  via  ingestion  for  the  member  of  public  older  than  17  years  are  1.3×10-8  SvBq-1  and 
1.9×10-8 SvBq-1 for 137Cs and 134Cs respectively (International Atomic Energy Agency, 1996). 

As the ratio of dose conversion factors for 137Cs and 134Cs is ≈ 0.7, it implies that ingestion of 
134Cs  contributes  about  30%  more  to  the  dose,  compared  to  ingestion  of  the  same  activity 
concentration of 137Cs. 

Collective  effective  dose  incurred  due  to  food  consumption  over  certain  time  period, 

depends on the activity of a radionuclide and on the quantity of food that is consumed. The 

dose can be expressed as:

Based  on  the  statistical  data  for  annual  consumption  rate  for  potatoes  of  40  kg,  the 
estimated total effective dose due to  137Cs and  134Cs ingestion by potato consumption for the 

Croatian  population  and  overall  observed  period,  i.e.  1986-2005  is  13.2  person-Sv.  Out  of 
this,  9.6  person-Sv  could  be  attributed  to  137Cs  and  3.6  person-Sv  to  134Cs.  4.2  person-Sv 
refers to the year 1986 (2.6 person-Sv and 1.6 person-Sv for 137Cs and 134Cs respectively). 

The annual effective collective doses are shown on Figure 4. 

It  should  be  noted  that  these  doses  are  rather  small  since  for  the  overall  1986-2005 

period per caput dose is . 2.9 :Sv. Consequently, it can be argued that after the Chernobyl 

accident  consumption  of  potatoes  was  not  the  critical  pathway  for  human  intake  of 

radiocaesium from the environment in Croatia.

CONCLUSIONS 

Long-term  investigations  of  radiocaesium  activity  concentrations  in  potatoes  and 

fallout  in  the  Republic  of  Croatia  showed  that  the  transfer  of  radiocaesium  from  fallout  to 

potatoes  and  finally  to  humans  was  pretty  low,  which  has  been  observed  also  elsewhere 
(Aarkrog, 1994). The 137Cs transfer coefficient from fallout to potatoes was of the same order 
of magnitude (10-4) as it was found to be for the other foodstuffs (10-4 - 10-3). For the events 

like  the  Chernobyl  nuclear  accident  the  season  of  the  year  is  the  most  important  factor 

determining the transfer of radioactive contamination from potatoes to men. 

The effective mean residence time of  137Cs in potatoes, describing the decrease in the 

 
observed 137Cs activity concentration with time, was estimated to be between 6 and 7 years.

Generally,  a  few  years  after  the  Chernobyl  nuclear  accident  the  activities  of  fission 
radionuclides  137Cs  and  134Cs  in  potatoes  in  Croatia  were  relatively  low,  in  magnitude 

comparable  to  the  pre-Chernobyl  period.  Consequently  the  doses  to  general  population 

received by radiocaesium in potatoes are small, in spite of considerably large consumption of

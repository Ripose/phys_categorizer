Inspecting plastic deformation of Pd by means of fractal geometry 

 

Ali Eftekhari * 

Abstract 

 

 

 

The  influence  of  phase  transformation-induced  plastic  deformation  in  Pd|H  system  on  the 

electrode  surface  was  investigated.  Since  the  Pd  surface  is  subject  of  severe  plastic 

deformation  during  this  process,  the  structure  and  roughness  of  the  electrode  surface 

significantly changes. Quantitative analysis of the electrode surfaces for comparative study of 

such changes is a valuable tool to inspect the plastic deformation induced. Fractal dimension 

can be used as a quantitative measure for this purpose. Since inappropriate methods may lead 

to  significant  errors,  an  appropriate  approach  was  proposed  for  the  determination  of  fractal 

dimensions  in  such  systems.  It  was  demonstrated  that  the  surface  roughness  generated  is 

mainly due to the plastic deformation induced, not the other side processes. The methodology

four different Pd electrodes were prepared by injection of various amounts of hydrogen during 

the  preliminary  charging  process,  as  the  galvanostatic  current  applied  for  different  times:  0, 

0.9, 1.8 and 2.7 ks (103 s). Thus, different Pd electrodes approximately with the pre-charged 

For  the  sake  of  similarity  of  the  experimental  results,  the  experiments  were  performed  in 

accordance  with  the  procedure  reported  in  [7]. Briefly,  different  amounts  of  hydrogen  were 

injected into Pd electrodes by applying a constant current of 13.5 mA cm–2 for various times 

under  galvanostatic  condition  in  a  solution  of  0.1  M  NaOH.  Then,  all  Pd  electrodes  were 

discharged  to  extract  the  whole  hydrogen  injected.  This  process  was  carried  out 

potentiostatically by jumping the electrode potential from 0.5 to 0.9 V vs. SCE. Similar to [7],

For  the  fractal  analysis  of  the  Pd  electrodes,  they  were  covered  by  Au  masks.  The  ideal 

masking  is  the  deposition  of  monolayer  of  Au,  but  a  little  more  charge  was  used  to  assure 

about  the  completeness  of  masking.  The  thickness  of  the  gold  mask  was  about  2  nm. 

Therefore,  the  Au-masked  Pd  electrode  can  be  considered  as  conventional  electrodes,  and 

states  of  PdH0, PdH0.23, PdH0.46  and  PdH0.6  were  obtained.  Note  that  these  are  just  symbols 

employed to distinguish them, and indeed all of them were discharged to the state of Pd. The

It  should  be  taken  into  account  that  process  of  plastic  deformation  is  not  important  in  this 

study.  Indeed,  plastic  deformations  were  generated  electrochemically,  since  it  is  a  simple 

method  for  this  purpose;  however,  any  other  processes  can  be  used  to  generate  plastic

electrochemical  systems,  and  any  Ph  specimen  can  be  analyzed  to  inspect  the  plastic 

transformation of (cid:1)-PdH to (cid:2)-PdH, and thus this issue will be disregarded here. In addition, it 

has  been  reported  that  the  fraction  of  (cid:2)-PdH  is  responsible  for  the  strength  of  the  plastic 

deformation. 

 

 

3. Results and discussion 

Review Copy

Pyun  and  his  co-workers  [7]  have  used  conventional  fractal  analysis  of  electrode  surfaces 

based  on  electrochemical  methods  to  measure  the  fractal  dimensions  of  the  Pd  electrodes 

(with  different  strengths  of  plastic  deformation)  varying  from  1.97  to  2.09.  There  are  two 

problems for the results reported in [7]. (i) The values of the fractal dimensions estimated are 

significantly lower than the real ones, as it is expected to be significantly higher than 2 (since 

they are rough surfaces), e.g., from 2.2 to 2.5. (ii) The difference of the fractal dimension of 

(cid:2)-PdH. Thus, the four electrodes viz. PdH0, PdH0.23, PdH0.46 and PdH0.6 can be considered as 

the electrochemical procedure inducing such plastic deformations, these samples will be used 

samples with different strengths of plastic deformation induced. In other words, regardless of 

deformation, and more injected hydrogen in the charging process results in higher fraction of 

throughout this study to investigate the degree (strength) of plastic deformation.

significant  deviation  from  this  assumption.  In  any  case,  regardless  of  the  surface  fractality 

scale, electrochemical methods based on “diffusion toward electrode surfaces” are useful for 

monitoring of fractality at length scales larger than one micron, and at the best conditions, just 

by the diffusing species, and have no significant effect on the fractality monitored. 

Since the diffusing species can sense the electrode surface structure, electrochemical methods 

able to sense the distances higher than 100 nm. Thus, both the original surface irregularities 

can be  used for  the determinations of the electrode surfaces. Two  reliable methods are  scan

and  chronoamperometry,  respectively.  It  is  known  that  the  diffusion-limited  current  in 

chronoamperometric  measurements  is  proportional  to  the  fractal  parameter   (cid:1) as:  I(t)  (cid:4) t–(cid:1)

By similar procedures, the fractal dimensions of different Pd electrodes were estimated (Table 

1).  The  results  indicate  that  the  fractal  dimension  is  proportional  to  the  degree  of  plastic 

deformation  induced,  since  the  value  of  fractal  dimension  is  higher  for  the  Pd  electrodes 

subjected  to  stronger  plastic  deformations.  Therefore,  the  fractal  dimension  of  the  electrode 

surface can be used as a quantitative measure of the plastic deformation induced, but only in a 

comparative study. It is obvious that the standard deviation of the values calculated is lesser

hydrogen could participate in the redox couple employed for the fractal analysis, which might 

be a source of error. Fortunately, this obligation is not applicable for the approach proposed

into/from  Pd;  however,  the  method  can  be  generally  used  for  the  investigation  of  plastic 

deformations leading to surface changes. The novelty of the present work is not due to study 

of  phase  transformation-induced  plastic  deformation  and  the  gold-masking  approach  for 

fractal analysis, since both of them have been previously reported in the literature. The aim is 

considered  as  a  conventional  electrode.  The  available  electrochemical  methods  for  Au 

surfaces are the most reliable cases. The present study was typically performed for the plastic 

structures  generated  as  a  result  of  plastic  deformation  may  be  missed.  Gold  masking  is  a 

simple and efficient approach to avoid possible errors, since after Au covering, the object is 

an  appropriate  method  for  the  determination  of  the  fractal  dimension,  since  the  interesting 

sensitivity of the structure formed as a result of plastic deformation, it is very important to use 

to  report  an  appropriate  strategy  based  on  available  approaches  for  such  investigations.  As

general, the approach proposed is useful for inspecting the solid-state structural changes, since

is  simple  and  can  be  used  by  solid-state  physicists  (generally  non-

electrochemists).

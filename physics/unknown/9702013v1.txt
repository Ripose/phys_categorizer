We apply a recently proposed approximation method to the evaluation of non-Gaussian
integral and anharmonic oscillator. The method makes use of the truncated perturbation
series by recasting it via the modiﬁed Laplace integral representation. The modiﬁcation of the
Laplace transformation is such that the upper limit of integration is cut oﬀ and an extra term
is added for the compensation. For the non-Gaussian integral, we ﬁnd that the perturbation
series can give accurate result and the obtained approximation converges to the exact result in
the N
limit (N denotes the order of perturbation expansion). In the case of anharmonic
oscillator, we show that several order result yields good approximation of the ground state
energy over the entire parameter space. The large order aspect is also investigated for the
anharmonic oscillator.

Introduction

Anharmonic oscillator is a system that is well understood in both perturbative and non-

perturbative aspects1,2. Still, the system plays an important role because it provides a good

laboratory for the examination of any calculational scheme newly proposed. The Lagrangian

of anharmonic oscillator is given by

and the non-linearity is governed by the coupling constant λ. The perturbation expansion is

given in powers of λ/m3. For instance the ground state energy reads,

where the coeﬃcients are found as1

It is known that the coeﬃcient An grows as An ∼

truncation.

The linear δ expansion3 is one of the framework which leads us to go beyond the weak cou-

pling regime. For example, recent studies 4,5 succeeded to approximate the ground state energy

in the pure anharmonic case (m = 0) by using the perturbative series (2). The strong coupling

expansion of the ground state energy is also given in the literature4 (For the convergence issue,

see ref.6).

Recently, a new perturbative scheme was proposed in ref.7. The proposed method utilizes

the information contained in the perturbation series by making Heaviside transformation8 with

respect to some parameter (mass in ref.7). In the present paper we extend the method and

explore how it can be used to obtain non-perturbative result in the two examples, a non-

Gaussian integral and the anharmonic oscillator. We try to construct approximants for the

2

integral and the ground state energy. For example, the approximant of the ground state energy

will be given at N-th perturbative order for λ = 1 as

and x∗ is the ”cut-oﬀ” parameter to be determined order by order in some manner. By our

approach one can approximate the ground state energy well over the entire region of the mass

m, including the strong coupling limit and the crossover region from the weak to the strong

coupling regime. We also note that application to ﬁeld theories is straightforward. There

exists no renormalization problem.

There is a pioneering work by Graﬃ et al.9, where Borel summation method was used to

compute the energy levels of the anharmonic oscillator. Our approach is similar to theirs.

However, our approach is diﬀerent from it in the respects that (i) the variable with respect

to which the transformation is carried out is not the coupling constant but the mass square †

and (ii) the Laplace integration is cut oﬀ and the extra term is added. We thus change the

representation form itself, while ref.8 modiﬁed the integrand according to Pad`e construction

to make up the Borel sum. In our case the integrand is just the truncated one.

This paper is organized as follows: In the next section, we ﬁrst review and then extend

the method of ref.6. The extension results in modifying the ordinary Laplace integral rep-

resentation as to ﬁt the perturbative approach and enables us to deal with the eﬀect of the

explicit mass for both large and small m2. In section 3 we perform a simple model calculation

of non-Gaussian integral by using the method presented in the previous section. We show that

the truncated perturbative series re-constructed by the method gives good approximation of

the exact integral and converges to the exact answer in the N

limit (N denotes the order
†The mass square, m2, corresponds to λ2/3 for the coupling constant. In terms of λ2/3/m2, the original
perturbation series is not a power series. This is not a negligible diﬀerence in our scheme. The issue will be
discussed in the last section.

of expansion). In section 4 we turn to the anharmonic oscillator. Via perturbation series, the

ground state energy is approximately calculated for various λ/m3 to several higher orders. We

will show that, already at 5-th order, the error of our approximation is less than 1 percent

for any λ/m3. In section 5 we address to large order aspects of our approach by proceeding

to 249-th order. Some discussion and summary of the present work is given in section 5. In

appendix we state the relation between our method and the linear δ expansion in a particular

limit.

2 Modiﬁed Laplace transformation

A part of the content of this section is same as the corresponding part in ref. 6. However, to

make the presentation self-contained, we allow some overlaps with the work.

For a given physical function f (σ), we consider the Heaviside transform7 given by the

Bromwich integral,

ˆf (x) =

p+i

∞

f (σ).

σ

Here the parameter p represents the location of the vertical contour. Although m2 corresponds

to σ in the cases we work with, there would be other choices in general. The contour of

integration should be placed on the right of all the possible poles and the cut of f (σ)/σ. Then,

if x < 0, the contour may be closed into the right half circle and ˆf (x) is found to vanish. From

ˆf (x) we have f (σ) via the Laplace integral of the second kind,

f (σ) = σ

∞

dx exp(

σx) ˆf (x).

Z

−∞

−

Since ˆf (x) = 0 when x < 0, the integration range reduces to [0,

). However it is convenient

∞

to keep the range as (

, +

) to handle partial integration easily.

−∞

∞

Now suppose that one is interested in the value of f at σ = 0, but the perturbative expansion

of f (σ) does not allow one to let σ arbitrary small. As in the Fourier transformation, small σ

behavior of f (σ) is connected with the large x behavior of ˆf (x). More precisely we ﬁnd that

where the existence of both limits are assumed. Our approximation procedure is based on (8)

and it goes as follows. Let fN (σ) denotes the perturbative expansion of f (σ) to N-th order.

Then the corresponding Heaviside function is given by

ˆfN (x) =

(9)

In cases of our interest, we can not take the naive limits, σ

, in the both functions.

→

→ ∞

Then there would be two routes to approximate f (0). Naive one is to approximate it by ﬁxing

σ as small as possible in some manner. The other is, relying upon (8), to approximate f (0) by

ˆfN (x) where x should be ﬁxed at some large value, x∗. Here note that ˆf(x) often has larger

convergence radius than f (σ). For example, if f (σ) =

∞n=0 anxn/n!
(x > 0). When ˆf(x) has the convergence radius larger than that of f (σ), it would be convenient

∞n=0 an/σn, then ˆf(x) =

P

P

to deal with ˆfN rather than fN . This is because we can probe the large x behavior of ˆf by

ˆfN so that we have more chance to know the accurate value of ˆf (

) and f (0) accordingly.

∞

Therefore, we choose to approximate f (0) by ˆfN (x∗). The explicit way of ﬁxing x∗ is discussed

in the next section. Here we just mention that, from the estimation of the upper bound of

reliable perturbative region, x∗ will be ﬁxed by the stationarity condition,

∂ ˆfN (x)
∂x (cid:12)
(cid:12)
(cid:12)
If there are several solutions, we should input the largest x∗ into ˆfN . This is obvious because
(cid:12)

= 0.

(10)

x=x∗

the value of ˆf at x =

is what we are looking for.

∞

The above approach can be extended to the approximation of the function itself over the

entire region of σ. Let us start the discussion by showing how we can approximate the small

σ expansion of f (σ),

f (σ) = f (0) + f (1)(0)σ + f (2)(0)

As well as f (0), we can approximate f (k)(0) as the following manner: From the formulas,

Assuming the expansion (11), the above two functions agree with each other at σ = 0 and

x =

N (σ), the derivative αk(x) is

∞

also truncated at order N. Hence, as in the previous case, we approximate f (k)(0) by αk(x)

by ﬁxing the upper limit of integration x as large as possible within the perturbative region.

Replacing ˆf (y) by ˆfN (y), we then choose the input x, say x∗k, according to the same logic as

that for x∗. That is, x∗k is determined by the stationarity condition,

Now it is an easy task to obtain expression which can be used for entire σ region: We

The left hand side of (17) deﬁnes the modiﬁcation of Laplace transformation. Note that, the

naive x∗

limit recovers the ordinary Laplace transform and gives fN (σ). We point out,

→ ∞

however, that for small m the dominant contribution comes from the ﬁrst term. Actually the

second term, the cut-oﬀ Laplace integral, gives zero in the m

0 limit. Thus the ﬁrst term is

the crucial ingredient in our approach. To summarize, our approach results in approximating

f (σ) by fN (σ, x∗) deﬁned by (17).

It would be interesting to see how the approximant, fN (σ, x∗), is diﬀerent from the ordinary

From its structure, (24) gives the large σ expansion of f corr

condition (10) the ﬁrst term in (24) vanishes. This shows that, for large σ, the condition

minimizes the deviation of the approximant from the ordinary perturbative result.

3 A simple model calculation: non-Gaussian integral

It would be worthwhile carrying out the calculation for a solvable model to gain some concrete

feeling on the method to be used. We take up here a non-Gaussian integral,

.

(26)

It is easy to see that the series diverges for any λ/m4. Only when λ/m4 <

0.1, the series can

be put into numerical use by the appropriate truncation. Nevertheless, we will show that we

can obtain the strong coupling (λ/m4

1) expansion from the divergent weak coupling series,

≫
and even an approximant which is eﬀective over the entire coupling regime.

e

First step is to obtain the integrand of Laplace representation. This is done by calculating

the integration (6) over m2 (i,e., σ = m2). Then the result is given by

ˆZ(x, λ) =

where θ(x) denotes the ordinary step function (θ(x) = 1 for x > 0 and 0 for x < 0). Note that

ˆZ converges for any λx2. For the sake of notational simplicity we set λ = 1 hereafter.

Let us introduce the perturbatively truncated ˆZ by

Xn=0
Now, we turn to the approximation of Z(m, λ = 1) = Z(m) by using (28). We ﬁrst discuss how

to choose the input x∗. The break down of perturbative series would generally appear as the

rapid rise or fall of the Heaviside function due to the domination of the highest term in (28).

Actually, the graphs of the function ˆZN (x) to the ﬁrst several orders show it is the case (see

Fig.1). Then, since ˆZN (x) is an alternative series, the rise and fall occurs alternatively. For

example, for odd N, ˆZN (x) temporally increases with x in the reliable perturbative region, but

after that (eventually?) it falls down to

. We note that ˆZN behaves temporarily ﬂat just

−∞

before the break down as shown in Fig.1. In this case the limit of perturbation would emerge

typically as the stationary point. This is the reason we employ the stationarity condition,

The solution of (30) exists for odd N and depends on N. By substituting x∗ into ˆZN (x) we

have the approximant of Z(0). The obtained result is satisfactory as shown in Table 1. Note

that x∗ increases with N, which is a desirable result.

We can also approximate the small mass (strong coupling) expansion of Z(m): First note

that the coeﬃcients of the k-th power of m2, αk(x∗), is given by

αk(x∗) =

Before closing this section we show that the approximant ˆZN (x∗) converges to ˆZ(

4 Approximation of the ground state energy of the anharmonic

oscillator

We turn to discuss the anharmonic oscillator from this section. In complicated systems it is

generally hard to proceed to arbitrary higher orders. Hence it is practically important to study

whether an employed approximation scheme works at low orders.

In this section we use perturbative series up to 9-th order and show that the several low

order result can yield good approximation of the ground state energy via modiﬁed Laplace

representation.

Let λ = 1 for notational simplicity. Our ﬁrst task is to obtain the Heaviside function of the

perturbative ground state energy, EN (m),

Heaviside transform of m−

3n+1 with respect to m2 gives

By suitable replacement of variable, the function ˆE agrees with the function appeared in

ref. 5 in which the δ expansion method was applied to the anharmonic oscillator (see eq.(7) of

ref. 5). Authors of ref. 5 considered the case where the coupling, δΩ2, grows to large orders (δ

represents a ﬁctitious parameter which is to be set 1 at the end of calculation and Ω2 denotes

the mass auxiliary introduced to divide the given Lagrangian un-conventionally). Then the

authors found that their approximant converges to the form (43) in that large order limit

‡. This implies that there may be some connection between the linear δ expansion and our
‡In δ expansion scheme, this limit corresponds to inﬁnite perturbative order. Then we note that in this
limit the parameter Ω is no longer arbitrary because it should be of the same order of magnitude with the
perturbative order. We also point out that this limit was considered in ref.9 from diﬀerent motivation.

method. Actually we show in appendix that it is the case; We will show that, in a particular

limit, the Heaviside transform is induced in a suitable interpretation.

Now, let us discuss the energy approximation using (43). As in the previous section we use

the following condition,

∂ ˆEN (x)
∂x

= 0,

(44)

to ﬁx the input x∗. Up to N = 9, while there is no solution for even N, we ﬁnd just one

solution for each odd N. By substituting x∗ into ˆEN (x), we obtain the approximation of E(0)

which is the energy in the pure anharmonic case or in other words in the strong coupling limit.

We also evaluate the succeeding Taylor coeﬃcients of ﬁrst ﬁve terms. For the purpose it may

be convenient to use the integrated form of αk,

5 Higher order behavior

The important information in our approach is contained in the Heaviside function ˆE(x). We

therefore investigate the properties of ˆE(x) relevant to our analysis by extending the pertur-

bative order up to 249-th.

An important issue in our approach is whether limx

ˆE(x) exists or not. Although we

→∞

do not have rigorous proof, we see convincing answer by ﬁguring out ˆEN (x) to large N. We

have generated perturbative coeﬃcients An up to 249 terms with the help of Mathematica and

plotted the graph of ˆE249(x) as shown in Fig.3. We note that plateau starts around x

1 and

∼

abruptly grows up around x

3.2, which shows the break down of perturbation expansion.

Taking closer look, we ﬁnd that the function ˆE249(x) weakly oscillates at the plateau region.

The amplitude of the oscillation is very tiny indeed; The diﬀerence between the ﬁrst extremum

and the next is just 0.0000103

which should be compared with the ﬁrst extremum value,

∼

· · ·

0.667975902279

. The diﬀerence between the second and third is about 0.00000001. Thus

· · ·

the amplitude decreases as the function oscillates to larger x. The values of three stationary

points of ˆE249 are given as

ˆE249 = 0.667975902279

x = 1.139689002700

ˆE249 = 0.667986268727

x = 2.069065340532

ˆE249 = 0.667986259143

x = 2.987637042160.

(55)

These values shows how the ˆEN at the plateau is close to the value E(0) which is known to

be12

E(0) = 0.667986259155777108270962

(56)

.

· · ·

Thus the behavior of ˆE249(x) for x

3, where the function is reliable, strongly suggests that

≤

limx

→∞

ˆE(x) would exist and consequently agree with E(0).

The ﬁrst, second and third stationary points begins to appear from 28,101 and 246 orders,

respectively. Hence, several solutions exist for some orders higher than 28-th. This phe-

nomenon was also observed in the δ expansion framework5. There it was found that the value

of interest at largest 1/Ω was most accurate. But within the framework there is no a priori

reason why one should take the largest 1/Ω. On the other hand, it is obvious in our approach

that one should focus on the largest x∗ as we mentioned in section 2. The behavior of our

approximants ˆEN (x∗) as the order increases is as follows. For x smaller than the largest x∗,

ˆEN (x) is a good approximation of the exact function and the departure starts around x

x∗.

∼

Therefore the largest stationary point sits in the vicinity of the exact function, and slides to

larger x direction along the curve of the exact function as N increases. Hence the convergence

issue of the approximants,

, is tightly connected with the convergence

ˆEN (x∗)

N = 1, 2,

{

|

· · ·}

ˆE(x) and how the stationary solution, x∗, grows with the order. Since, by the def-

of limx

→∞

inition, the largest x∗ is located at the upper limit of reliable region,

ˆEN (x∗)

N = 1, 2,

· · ·}
). It is also clear that ˆEN (x∗) oscillates as N increases by following the

{

|

would converge to ˆE(

∞

function ˆE(x). This oscillatory property of the approximant was observed (but not clariﬁed)

by Kleinert4.

As is obvious from the above discussion, the largest stationary point around the order

N = 246 (at which the third stationary point of ˆE(x) is settled) is approximately given by

the third stationary point shown in the last of (55). Therefore using that value of x∗, we can

see how accurate EN (m, x∗) is for various m2. The result of computer calculation is shown in

Table 4 and shows that the obtained values are quite accurate for all m2 .

Finally let us comment on the behavior of bi,N , the coeﬃcients of Ecorr

at large m, for large

N

N. We have calculated them at N = 28, 101, 249. We ﬁnd that the size of bi,N decreases to zero

as the order N increases. For example, the results for i = 1 to 7 at N = 249 are respectively

given as follows;

b1,249 = 0E

22, b2,249 = 8.259931E

10, b3,249 =

(57)

Thus, for lower i, the result almost agrees with the requirement that limx

∂i ˆE(x)/∂xi = 0.

For larger i, however, the coeﬃcient bi,249 grows rapidly. This represents that as x exceeds x∗

ˆE249(x) abruptly grows as shown in Fig.3.

6 Discussion and conclusion

Critical things leading our scheme to the success are that the convergence radius, ρ, is inﬁnite

for the Heaviside functions ˆf (x) and that they quickly approach to the value ˆf (

) at ﬁnite

x. The later fact is conﬁrmed numerically for the anharmonic oscillator from the remarkable

closeness of ˆEN (x) at x

The approach to ˆf (

to note that ˆZ(x) has no power-like term, x−

n, in large x expansion (58).

Actually these features are related with the choice of integration variable generally denoted

as σ. We discuss on this issue by our two examples.

First consider the non-Gaussian integral case and let σ = mβ. We numerically study on

how the function ˆZ varies according to the power β. In calculating the transform, the following

result is convenient to use:

Then we ﬁnd that ˆZ

(x) is a divergent series for β > 4 and becomes a convergent one for

β = 4 where the convergence radius is 1/4. When β < 4, the series becomes a convergent one

for any x. We have plotted in Fig.4 the series for β

[1, 3] at N = 100. Next problem is

whether the limit limx

(x) exists or not. From the numerical calculation at N = 200,

ˆZ

We do not know why around β = 1.32 the convergence property changes. Now, we observe the

following features: When β is small the truncated series becomes eﬀective to large x but ˆZ(x)

does not converge at x =

. As β increases beyond

1.32 but still within β < 4, the eﬀective

∼

range of truncated series decreases but the saturation to ﬁnite ˆZ(

) is fast. Furthermore the

∞

oscillation amplitude damps as β decreases. From these points, it is subtle that, at a ﬁxed

order, what value of β between

1.32 and 4 gives the best approximation. We have calculated

∼

ˆZN (x∗) at N = 99 or 100 for β = 1.5, 1.7, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1. The result reads

β = 1.5

1.8169575 (x = 15.037, N = 100)

β = 1.7

1.81926459 (x = 10.336, N = 100)

β = 1.9

1.81719914639 (x = 7.1806, N = 100)

β = 2.0

1.812804954110934 (x = 5.34, N = 99)

β = 2.1

1.8051679 (x = 5.043, N = 99).

(61)

Thus we ﬁnd that the best approximation is realized at β = 2.0. The agreement to the exact

value, 1.812804954110954

is remarkable for that case (The ﬁrst 14 decimals are in the

agreement).

· · ·

We note that the ordinary Borel summation method employees λ as the transformation

variable. This means in our context that σ = m4. Then the convergence radius of pertur-

bative ˆZ(x) becomes ﬁnite (ρ = 1/4) and the choice is not suited for our modiﬁed Laplace

representation approach where the integrand is truncated and the upper integration limit is

cut oﬀ.

Hence the series is divergent for β > 3 and ρ is inﬁnite for β < 3. For β = 3 the series is

a convergent one, but ρ = 1/3. We have ﬁgured out ˆE249(x) by varying β from 1 to 3. The

result is shown in Fig.5. The convergence property of ˆE

limit seems to

the best approximation of E(0) at N = 248 or 249. For β = 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 2.0, 2.1 we obtained

0.67107970759 (x = 2.5012, N = 249).

(64)

From the above sample, we ﬁnd that the choice β = 2 gives the particular good approximation.

The ordinary Borel choice of variable, σ = m3, also does not work well in our approach. This

is because in that choice the convergence radius of perturbative ˆE(x) becomes ﬁnite (ρ = 1/3).

It is interesting to note that why the choice, β = 2, gives the best approximation in both

cases. Although we have not resolved it yet, we suspect that the resolution would have related

to the fact that Z(m) and E(m) has expansion in the square of the mass, c0 + c1m2 + c2(m2)2 +

Hence, there is no powers of 1/x in the corresponding Heaviside function at large x. Note that

when the power ξ is fractional the transform of σξ survives to give x−

ξ. Thus, as well as ˆZ(x)

which is analytically solved as (58), ˆE(x) would be suppressed exponentially only at β = 2

and the smallness of the diﬀerence

ˆE(x)

ˆE(

would be thus explained.

∞
To conclude this paper, we have demonstrated how truncated perturbation series can be

utilized to approximate the non-perturbative quantities via modiﬁed Laplace representation.

The non-Gaussian integral is precisely calculated from the truncated perturbation series. And

18

the approximant for the strong coupling limit is found to converge in the N

limit.

→ ∞

The ground state energy of the anharmonic oscillator is also approximated successfully over

the entire parameter space. Large order calculation strongly suggests that our approach works

well to all orders. In both examples, we ﬁnd that the perturbative knowledge serves us suﬃcient

information for recovering the small mass or strong coupling expansion.

In ﬁeld theories, however, perturbation series has more complex structure in general. For

example, the perturbation series for the dressed mass, vacuum energy density or condensates

involves the mass logarithm, log m. When the mass-logs exist, it is no longer expected that the

convergence radius is enlarged by Heaviside transformation with respect to the mass, although

some qualitative improvement is found in the literature (ﬁrst paper in ref.6). This is the

subject of our future investigation.

Let us concentrate on the m = 0 case hereafter. Then one should set δ = 1, which represents

to relevant orders. Let the number of δΩ2 vertex and λ coupling in a given Feynman diagram

In this expansion scheme, any contributing diagrams are obtained such that, given a Feynman

diagram with no δΩ2 vertex, one should incorporate it by shifting δ and then expanding in δ

up to just the order of perturbative expansion. This procedure is formally carried out as we

can see below.

thus necessary to let N and Ω2 simultaneousely large with N/Ω2 kept ﬁnite. And accordingly,

Ω2 is no longer a free ﬁnite parameter. If we adopt this recipe, the equality of (73) breaks

down and we should take the righthand side of (73) as a new function ˆf of variable x = N/Ω2.

We remark that although we have shown that, in our modiﬁed expansion scheme, the δ

because the diﬀerence of the included diagrams between the two expansions increases as the

Fig. 4 The function ˆZ100(x) is shown for various choice of β. The amplitude of oscillation of

ˆZ100(x) decreases as β decreases from 1.0 to 2.0. The eﬀective range of the series is larger

for smaller β but the saturation to ˆZ(

) is slower. When β is close to 2.0, the oscillation

is weak and the saturation to ˆZ(

) is very fast.

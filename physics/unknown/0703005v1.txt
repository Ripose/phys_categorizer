Abstract 

 
The article provides an analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for the case of 

the steady flow of an incompressible fluid between two uniformly co-rotating disks. The 

solution is derived from the asymptotical evolution of unknown components of velocity 

and  pressure  in  a  radial  direction--in  contrast  to  the  Briter-Pohlhausen  analytical 

solution,  which  is  supported  by  simplified  Navier-Stokes  equations.  The  obtained 

infinite system of ordinary differential equations forms recurrent relations from which 

unknown functions can be calculated successively. The first and second approximations 

of solution are solved analytically and the third and fourth approximations of solutions 

are  solved  numerically.  The  numerical  example  demonstrates  agreements  with  results 

obtained by other authors using different methods. 

Keywords: incompressible fluid, steady flow, co-rotating disks 

1. Introduction 
 
 

The object of investigation of this paper is the steady flow of viscous fluid between two 

parallel  co-rotating  disks  where  the  fluid  enters  an  inner  cylinder  in  a  radial  direction 

and  emerges  at  the  outer  cylinder  (Figure  1).  Note  that  the  problem  differs  from  the 

celebrated  von  Karman  problem  and  its  generalization  since  this  problem  investigates 

the swirling flow induced by the rotation of infinite disks (Rajagopal 1992).

It  seems  that  the  problem--in  the  context  of  application  in  the  design  of  centrifugal 

pumps--was  first  studied  in  1962  by  M.Breiter  in  K.Pohlhausen  (1962).  From  the 

linearized  boundary layer approximations of Navier-Stokes equations they derived the 

analytical  expressions  for  velocity  components  and  pressure  showing  that  the  solution 

depends  on  kinematic  viscosity,  angular  velocity  and  the  distance  between  the  disks. 

They also provide a numerical solution of the non-linearized equations using the finite 

difference  method  with  constant  inlet  profile.  This  line  of  research  was  continued  by 

W.Rice  and  coworkers,  whose  main  goal  was  the  prediction  of  the  performance  of  a 

centrifugal  pump/compressor.  They  used  different  methods  to  obtain  velocity  and 

pressure distribution of flow between two disks. Thus Rice (1963) studied the flow with 

equations  derived  by  using  hydraulic  treatment  of  bulk  flow;  Boyd  and  Rice  (1968) 

used  the  finite  difference  method  to  calculate  velocity  and  pressure  for  various 

parabolically  distributed  inlet  velocities;  and  Boyack  and  Rice  (1971)  used  what  they 

called  the  integral  method,  in  which  the  velocity  components  are  represented  by  a 

polynomial of the axial coordinate.  

Another  line  of  research  of  the  so  called  laminar  source-sink  flow  in  a  rotating 

cylindrical  cavity  originated  with  the  analytical  study  by  Hide  (1968),  who  gave  the 

approximate asymptotic expressions for velocity components using the boundary-layer 

technique.  Numerically, by using the finite-difference method, the problem was solved 

by Bennetts and Jackson (1974). Owen et al (1985) used the integral-momentum of von 

Karman that extended Hide's linear approximation to the turbulent flow. Recently, the 

steady flow between rotating disks was included in the study by Crespo del Arco  et al 

(1996) using a pseudo-spectral numerical method.   

 

 

From the above brief review of literature it is clear that the problem is analytically and 

especially numerically well studied and the results of calculations are in agreement with 

experiments.  However,  all  available  analytical  solutions  are  based  on  variants  of 

approximation. In this article, an alternative analytical solution will be presented, which 

is  based  on  the  asymptotic  expansion  of  unknown  functions  by  a  method  similar  to 

those  of  Savage  (1964),  who  considered  the  stationary  radial  directed  flow  between

steady  disks.    The  article  is  organized  as  follows.  After  the  basic  equations  are 

established,  their  dimensionless  forms  are  provided.  The  equations  are  solved  and  the 

results are compared with other methods. 

2 Basic equations 

Consider  the  steady  axisymmetrical  isothermal  flow  of  incompressible  viscous  fluid 

between two co-rotating disks in the absence of body force. The disks have inner radius 

a and outer radius b. The distance between disks is 

2h

. Both disks rotate in the same 

direction  with  constant  angular  velocity 

Ω .    For  description  of  flow,  the  reference 

frame rotating with angular velocity  Ω  is used. In this frame, by using the cylindrical 

coordinate system with coordinates r and z, the continuity equation and Navier-Stokes 

equations have the form (cf. Acheson 1990, Landau and Lifshitz 1987):

ρ is the density, and ν

is the kinematic viscosity.  

 

Equations (1) and (2) are to be solved on the domain

 subject 

to the following boundary conditions along the disks’ plane

The boundary condition in entrance and outer cross section requires prescribed velocity 

components  as  functions  of  coordinate  z.  Since  the  asymptotic  series  solution,  which 

will be used, does not offer enough free parameters to satisfy this boundary condition, it 

is  replaced  by  prescribing  the  volume  flow  rate  Q.  Therefore,  at  outer  cross  section 

r b=

 one has the condition 

Q

Because  (4)  does  not  refer  to  the  interval  [

],a b its  limits  become  artificial.  So  in  this 

context b will be used as the reference radius. Also, because the boundary condition at 

the  inner  and  outer  cross  sections  will  not  be  precise,  the  solution  will  not  cover  the 

inner source region and outer sink layer (Owen et al 1985). 

Once equations (1) and (2) are solved, the tangential velocity components in the inertial 

reference frame is obtained by adding velocity  v

r= Ω(cid:4)

 to relative tangential velocity v 

and the total pressure obtained by adding the pressure 

(cid:4)
p ρ= Ω

 to the pressure p.

Since  the  structure  of  equations  becomes  more  and  more  complex,  the  equations  (34) 

and  (35)  are  solved  numerically  as  one  set  of  six  linear  differential  equations  which 

together with (36) represent the linear boundary value problem.

.  These  data  givs 

λ=

21.1289

  and 

ε=

.  For  the  purpose  of 

calculations  a  computer  program  was  written.  For  the  solution  of  the  linear  boundary 

value  problem  of  the  third  and  fourth  set  of  equations  the  collocation  boundary  value 

solver  colnew  was  used  (Ascher  et  al  1995).  All  computations  using  the  colnew 

subroutine were performed by setting tolerance to 

810−  for all variables. The positions 

of  extremes  of  velocity  components  were  calculated  numerically  by  the  function  fmin 

(0).  Also it turns out that the obtained solutions of the problem are asymptotic series' 

which are divergent, so the question regarding how many terms are needed to calculate 

unknown  functions  accurately  arises.  Following  Van  Dyke  (1975)  the  terms  of 

divergent series' was at each radius summed up to the smallest. 

The profiles of radial, tangential and axial velocity at 

r =
*

0.54955

 (which correspond 

to Crespo del Arco's 

r =(cid:4)

4.1

) are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4. All computed velocity 

components  were  rescaled  by  the  factor 

2λ ε  for  purposes  of  comparison.  It  is  seen 

from these figures that the profiles for radial and tangential velocity match those given 

in (0). In Figure 5 the distribution of pressure along disks at 

z =  is shown calculated 
*

0

using  different  numbers  of  terms  in  the  solution.  It  is  seen  that  for 

r >
*

0.3

  the  two, 

23/12/2005  16:57:15 

 
13

 

three  and  four  term  solution  practically  coincides,  while  for  smaller  values  the  three 

term solution is of use. 

Table  1  compares  results  obtained  by  the  present  solution  to  those  obtained  by  Hide's 

approximation and Crespo del Arco's numerical pseudo-spectral method for tangential 

velocity  value  at 

z =
*

0

  and  the  position  of  maximal  radial  velocity  and  minimal 

tangential  velocity.  The  minor  discrepancy  between  solutions  can  be  explained  by  the 

fact that boundary conditions for solutions at entrance and exit are different. 

 

 

For additional confirmation of the solution, Table 2 gives the values and axial position 

of  maximal  radial  velocity  and  values  and  position  of  minimal  tangential  velocity 

calculated  using  different  numbers  of  terms  in  the  series  solution.  It  is  seen  from  the 

table that computed maximal value of radial velocity when using one term and four term 

solutions  differs  by  about  7%,  while  its  position  matches  to  two  decimal  places.  The 

same observation also holds for minimal tangential velocity, but minimal value differs 

by  about  9%.  The  radial  velocity  profile  near  maximal  value  for  different  numbers  of 

terms used in calculation is also presented in Figure 6. 

To estimate relative error the values of velocity components was calculated at a fixed 

axial  position  with  different  numbers  of  terms.  The  results  of  calculation  with 

successive relative errors are shown in Table 3. It is seen that estimated relative error 

drops with the number of terms; thus relative error is at most 2%. 

6. Concluding remarks 

The present solution regarding the stationary flow of viscous fluid between two parallel 

co-rotating  disks  differs  from  known  analytical  solutions  since  no  approximation  is 

made  in  the  governing  continuity  and  the  Navier-Stokes  equations.  However,  the 

obtained  solution  for  unknown  velocity  components  and  pressure  in  an  asymptotic 

series  form  has  a  drawback  since  these  series'  are  divergent  meaning  that  all  the 

problems associated with such series' are incorporated into the solution. Regardless of 

the  utility  of  the  contemporary  numerical  methods  by  which  not  only  steady  state  but 

 

 

 

23/12/2005  16:57:15 

 
14

 

also  turbulent  flow  can  be  studied,  the  present  analytical  solution  has  methodological 

value  and  can  also  be  used  for  comparative  calculation  when  testing  the  accuracy  of 

different numerical methods in fluid mechanics.

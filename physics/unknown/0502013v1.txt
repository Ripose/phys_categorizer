Abstract 

In this paper, we analyze the probability density function (PDF) of solar wind velocity and 

proton density, based on generalized thermostatistics (GT) approach, comparing theoretical 

results  with  observational  data.  The  time  series  analyzed  were  obtained  from  the  SOHO 

satellite  mission  where  measurements  were  sampled  every  hour.  We  present  in  the 

investigations  data  for  two  years  of  different  solar  activity:  (a)  moderate  activity  (MA) 

period  (1997)  and  (b)  high  activity  (HA)  period  (2000).  For  the  MA  period,  the  results 

show  good  agreement  between  experimental  data  and  GT  model.  For  the  HA  period,  the 

agreement  between  experimental  and  theoretical  PDFs  was  fairly  good,  but  some 

distortions  were  observed,  probably  due  to  intermittent  characteristics  of  turbulent 

processes.  As  a  complementary  analysis,  the  Global  Wavelet  Spectrum  (GWS)  was 

obtained  allowing  the  characterization  of    the  predominant  temporal  variability  scales  for 

both  the  periods  and  the  stochastics  aspects  of  the  nonlinear  solar  wind  variability  are 

discussed.

Introduction 

Due  to  the  important  role  of  the  solar  wind  properties  in  the  solar-terrestrial  plasma 

relations  and  magnetospheric  physics,  the  study  of  its  statistical  properties  and  their 

relations to those in the geomagnetic indices has been attracting growing interest (Kovács 

et al., 2001; Lui, 2002; Hnat et al., 2002). Statistical behaviour of velocity field fluctuations 

recorded in wind tunnels and these obtained from solar wind observations exhibit striking 

similarities (Hnat et al.,  2002),  where a  common feature found in both  fluctuations is  the 

presence of statistical intermittency (Burlaga, 1991; Marsch and Tu, 1994; Marsch and Tu, 

1997;  Burlaga  and  Foreman,  2002).  The  intermittency  phenomena  in  the  framework  of 

turbulence theory has been investigated by many authors through laboratory and numerical 

experiments  (e.g.  Anselmet  et  al.,  1984;  Frisch,  1995;  Ramos  et  al.,  2001a)  and  the 

investigation  of  turbulent  hydrodynamical  flows  has  been  developed  considering  many 

different  approaches:  Reynolds-stress  models;  subgrid-scale  models  for  large-eddy 

simulations  (LES);  spectral  models;  and  probability  density  functions  (PDF)  models 

(Frisch,  1995).  On 

the  other  hand, 

the 

turbulence  modeling  of 

intermittent 

magnetohydrodynamical  (MHD)  flows  are  based  on:  (i)  the  She-Leveque  approach,  that 

describes the observed scaling structure function (Biskamp and Müller, 2000); (ii) Fokker-

Planck  equation  considering  the  Castaing  distribution  (Castaing  et  al.,  1990;  Hnat  et  al., 

2002). Such approaches are used in the isotropic inertial subrange of turbulent fluctuations 

3

assuming  the  Kolmogorov  hypothesis  and  contain  the  energy  cascade  phenomenology 

(Kolmogorov, 1941, 1962). 

Usually, the properties of turbulent flows, despite the nature of the underlying physics, are 

studied  from  the  probability  density  functions  (PDFs)  of  fluctuating  quantities  (velocity 

differences,  for  example)  at  different  separation  scales.  It  is  a  well-known  property  of 

turbulent  flows  that,  at  large  scales,  these  PDFs  are  normally  distributed.  However,  at 

increasingly  smaller  scales,  they  become  strongly  non-Gaussian  and  display  tails  flatter 

than  expected  for  a  Gaussian  process.  This  is  interpreted  as  the  signature  of  the 

intermittency: the emergence of strong bursts in the kinetic energy dissipation rate. Within 

this  framework,  intermittency  and  non-extensive  turbulence  are  linked  by  the  entropic 

parameter  q  from  generalized  thermostatistics  theory  (Ramos  et  al.,  1999;  Beck,  2000; 

Arimitsu and Arimitsu, 2000; Ramos et al, 2001a, 2001b, Bolzan et al., 2002, Ramos et al. 

2004). Recently, characterization of intermittent turbulence in the solar wind velocity was 

performed  using  generalized  distribution  from  the  nonextensive  statistics  approach 

(Burlaga and Viñas, 2004). The nonextensive parameter q represents a measurable quantity, 

flow  independent  and  robust  to  variations  in  the  Reynolds  number,  that  can  be  used  to 

quantify  the  ocurrence  of  intermittency  in  turbulent  flows.  Moreover,  the  existence  of 

possible coherent structures in the time-frequency domain related to intermittent turbulent 

fluctuations can be well characterized by means of the global wavelet spectra (Rosa et al., 

2002).  In  this  paper,  analysing  the  solar  wind  and  proton  density  data,  we  show  that  this 

new approach provides interesting insights on MHD turbulence in a complex environment 

such as the solar-terrestrial plasma.

Data 

The  data  of  solar  wind  and  proton  density  analysed  in  this  work  were  observed  by  the 

SOHO 

satellite 

and  provided  by 

the  University  of  Maryland  data  base 

(http://umtof.umd.edu/pm/crn/). The time series used were measured in the years 1997 and 

2000 and were sampled at the rate of 1 measurement per hour. Figure 1 shows both the time 

series (solar wind velocity and proton density) for 12 months of 1997 and Figure 2 shows 

the similar data sets for 12 months of 2000. 

The solar wind for 1997 has moderate amplitude when compared with the similar data set 

for  2000.  The  plot  of  solar  wind  for  2000  represents  a  characteristic  scenario  in  the 

evolution of the solar cycle, notably the impulsive change of the velocity amplitude in the 

month July. This enhancement in the solar wind velocity is associated with the very strong 

solar disturbance that occurred in July. Also, for the proton density time-series, for both the 

MA  and  HA  periods,  we  found  significant  differences  in  temporal  variability,  notably  a 

higher amplitude for 2000 compared with 1997. It is important to point out that the usage of 

proton density data has larger errors than the velocity data, which is an intrinsic problem in 

the  analysis  of  the  data,  however  there  is  some  consistency  in  the  proton  density  and 

velocity data used here.

Theory 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Recently,  Kovács  et  al. (2001) have suggested  that, disregarding  storms  and/or substorms 

as the main sources of the evolution of the geomagnetic disturbances, the fluctuating nature 

of  the  field  can  be  interpreted  in  the  present  context  as  manifestation  of  turbulent 

phenomena  that  take  place  within  the  plasma  of  the  magnetosphere.  It  has  long  been 

accepted  that  turbulence  evolves  through  cascade  processes  that  involve  a  hierarchy  of 

coherent vortex structures belonging to a wide range of spatial scales. Kolmogorov (1962) 

proposed the inhomogeneous flow down (cascade) of the energy from system-size scales to 

dissipative  ones.  The  inhomogeneity  involves  the  singular  behaviour  of  the  energy 

distribution  in  physical  space  resulting  in  strong  gradients,  or  intermittency  in  the  time-

series  of  the  energy  related  physical  quantities  of  the  system,  e.g.  velocity  (Ramos  et  al., 

2001a),  temperature  (Bolzan  et  al.,  2002)  or  magnetic  fields  (Kovács  et  al.,  2001;  Lui, 

2002).

The parameters q and β determine the shape of the PDF and are computed from equation 3 

(Bolzan et al., 2002; Ramos et al., 2004). Thus, note that the q and β parameters are derived 

from the experimental kurtosis for each scale. 

We also used the Global Wavelet Spectrum (GWS) through the Morlet Wavelet Transform 

(MWT). This mathematical tool is similar to Power Spectrum Density (PSD) obtained by 

Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and is based in the calculation of variance in each scale, or 

period, obtained by MWT. The objective of this procedure is to identify the predominant 

scales (periods) driving the turbulent process. For this, the computation consists in to sum 

all  energy  associated  with  each  scale.  This  can  be  performed  according  to  the  following 

equation (Le and Wang, 2003):

Results and Discussions 

In order to validate the model described in section 2, we compared measured distributions, 

corresponding to two different periods of solar activity, for both variables, solar wind and 

proton density, with the theoretical PDFs obtained from equation 1. For each data set, we 

measured the variance and kurtosis, which allowed us to compute q and β by means of the 

corresponding  expressions  obtained  from  equation  3.  The  parameter  α  was  chosen 

according to the empirical formula α = 6 - 5q as used by Bolzan et al. (2002) and Ramos et 

al. (2004). 

Figure 3 presents the theoretical and experimental semi logarithmic plots of 

q xp

 versus

for the solar wind velocity in 1997. The increment scales r used were

These scales are similar to the ones used by Burlaga and Viñas (2004). Overall, we observe 

that  the  theoretical  results  (solid  lines)  are  in  good  agreement  with  measurements  across 

8

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

spatial  scales  spanning  three  orders  of  magnitude  and  a  range  of  up  to  5  standard 

deviations,  including  the  rare  fluctuations  at  the  tail  of  the  distributions. We  performed  a 

simple  error  analysis  given  by  the  correlation  coefficient  between  experimental  and 

theoretical PDF for each scale, as shown in Table 1. We note that there are higher values of 

correlation  coefficient  for  all  the  increment  scales,  indicaty  good  agreement  between 

experimental data and our model results. The transition from large-scale Gaussian behavior 

to  a  stretched  exponential  form  as  r  decreases  is  quite  evident  and  well  reproduced  by 

Tsallis´ distribution (Tsallis, 1988). At small scales, the distributions have tails larger than 

that  expected  for  a  normal  process.  This  excess  of  large  fluctuations,  compared  to  a 

Gaussian distribution, is a well known signature of intermittency. The spiky shape near the 

origin is also a signature of intermittency (Frisch, 1995). According to Burlaga and Viñas 

(2004), these high points on the tail of the distribution in PDF for 

2

 hours, represents a 

few large jumps in the solar wind velocity associated with shocks, stream interfaces,  and 

some  discontinuities  with  large  shear.  Furthermore,  PDF  for 

20

  hours  presented 

significative positive skewness, similar to results reported by Burlaga and Viñas (2004) for 

lags  of  16  hours.  According  to  these  authours,  this  skewness  is  a  consequence  of  stream 

steepening,  i.e.,  faster  plasma  overtaking  slower  plasma.  The  PDF  for 

=r

3

3.8

  days, 

presents  a  transition  between  the  stretched  exponential  to  Gaussian  form.  This  behavior 

may be associated with the slow flows, that have temporal scales in the range of the 1 to 

several days. Similar result was also obtained by Burlaga and Viñas (2004) for lag of 1.3 

days.  Now,  the  PDF  for 

3.83

  days,  presents  a  Gaussian  format,  where  according

Figure  4  presents  also  the  theoretical  and  experimental  semi  logarithmic  plots  of 

q xp
( r

)

 

versus 

rx  at same scales for proton density for 1997. We observe that the theoretical results 

(solid lines) are in good agreement with measurements across spatial scales spanning three 

orders  of  magnitude  and  a  range  of  up  to  5  standard  deviations.  Also,  we  performed  the 

correlation coefficient between experimental and theoretical PDF for each scale, as shown 

in  Table  2.  Again,  we  can  observer  the  higher  values  for  correlation  coefficient  for  all 

scales, showing good agreement between experimental data and our model. We can observe 

that  all  the  PDFs  exhibits  stronger  non-Gaussian  behavior  than  the  solar  wind  velocity 

PDFs. This distinct behavior between both the variables is due the peculiar characteristic of 

passive-scalar as pointed by Warhaft (2000) and Basu et al. (2003). This is an interesting 

aspect of differences between both the variables. 

To  study  more  closely  this  distinct  behavior  in  both  the  variables,  we  also  estimated  the 

variation  with  scale  of  parameter  q  and  plotted  the  parameter  q  by  increment  r  for  both 

quantities and for both the years, as shown in Figure 5. As a first analysis, we note that the 

four curves have similar behavior, where the parameter q value decreases as r grows. Katul 

et  al.  (1994)  using  a  parameter  related  to  scale  kurtosis,  the  wavelet  flatness  factor  (FF), 

have shown that in the inertial subrange scales, the more the separation distance r increases, 

the lower are the values of FF. They have also shown that this FF value trend is caused by 

the  increase  of  intermittency  in  the  smallest  scales  of  the  inertial  subrange.  In  this  sense, 

their results are similar to the ones presented in Figures 3 and 4 in which there is a clear 

enhancement of q as r decreases. The important aspect found is that the proton density data 

10

set is more intermittent than the solar wind velocity. This peculiar feature was observed in 

data set of passive scalars, like turbulent temperature in atmospheric of Amazonia (Bolzan 

et al., 2002; Ramos et al., 2004) and laboratory flows (Warhaft, 2000). Another interesting 

fact is that the intermittency level for both the variables is higher for 2000 if compared with 

1997. This characteristic is important because it shows the difference between the two time-

series for two different conditions: one time-series that represents a moderate solar activity 

period and, the other time-series that represents high solar activity. 

 

 

From  the  analyses  presented  above,  we  note  that  the  proton  density  time-series  are  more 

intermittent  than  the  solar  wind  velocity.  However,  it  is  observed  in  Figure  3,  we  do  not 

have  good  agreement  between  experimental  and  theoretical  PDFs  of  the  solar  wind 

velocity.  This  behavior  may  be  related  of  the  particular  skewness  in  solar  wind  velocity. 

Many  investigations  have  reported  the  presence  of  the  skweness  in  solar  wind  velocity 

time-series (Burlaga and Foreman, 2002; Burlaga and Viñas, 2004). Furthermore, Basu et 

al.  (2003),  through  the  proposed  scheme  to  generate  synthetic  turbulent  velocity  and 

passive-scalar in hydrodynamics fields, show that in the small-scales the skewness presents 

the values of approximately –0.3 to –0.4 and, these small negative values are believed to be 

the origin of vortex stretching and nonlinear energy transfer from large to small scales. To 

show  the  skewness  aspect,  we  performed  the  skewness  for  same  four  increment  r  to  the 

solar wind velocity and proton density data, for both the years. Figure 6 displays only the 

skewness  of  the  solar  wind  velocity,  because  the  results  for  the  proton  density  show  the 

values  of  the  skewness  close  to  zero.  The  bulk  velocity  is  usually  between  200  and  700 

km/s  with  an  average  of  400  km/s  (Hargreaves,  1979).  We  note  the  high  values  in  the 

skewness for 2000, in all increment scale r, if compared with 1997. We did not get negative 

11

values for the skewness, as obtained by Basu et al. (2003). This behavior may be indicating 

a  different  role  of  the  skewness  between  the  two  turbulence,  hydrodynamic  and 

magnetohydrodynamic.  However,  we  note  that  the  solar  activity  has  an  important  role  in 

this parameter. 

For  understanding  the  influence  of  the  solar  activity  in  both  the  variables,  we  used  an 

algorithm for Global Wavelet Spectrum (GWS) presented by Torrence and Compo (1998). 

This algorithm was applied in the solar wind and proton density time-series for two years, 

1997 and 2000. Figure 7 shows the GWS for proton density for both the years. We note that 

there is increase of energy in some periods for 2000. In particular, the increase of energy 

with a period of approximately 26 days, corresponds to the solar rotation. We also observe 

the increase of the energy with lower periods like that 9 and 13 days. These periods can be 

explained through the fact that this year occurred many solar disturbances of short periods. 

For  the  solar  wind  velocity,  the  GWS  show  great  differences  between  the  both  the  years 

(Figure 8). Again, we note the increase of energy in all the periods for 2000, mainly in the 

short periods, corresponding to approximately 9 and 13 days. However, we did not observe 

influence of the solar activity in the increase of the energy in smaller periods of less than 1 

day. This subject will be investigated in near future to understand how the energy transfer 

occurs between large and small scales during the high solar activity period of the Sun. 

Concluding Remarks 

12

 

 

 

 

 

We have studied the PDFs of solar wind velocity and proton density for the two different 

periods  of  solar  activity,  1997  (moderate  activity)  and  2000  (high  activity),  measured  by 

spacecraft  sensors.  Our  approach  was  based  on  generalized  thermostatistics  theory.  The 

behavior  of  the  entropic  parameter  q  can  be  used  to  objectively  quantify  intermittency 

buildup in turbulent flows. From a practical point of view, the use of the entropic parameter 

as a measure of intermittency is justified by the fact that q is the key parameter that controls 

the  shape  of  the  PDF,  which  accurately  models  the  statistics  of  turbulent  solar  wind  and 

proton density. As expected from the earlier theoretical results, we found higher values of q 

in proton density for both the years. This is due to the peculiar characteristics of the scalar 

parameters. Similar results were obtained by Bolzan et al. (2002) and Ramos et al. (2004) 

using  temperature  time-series  measured  in  the  turbulent  flow  of  the  Amazonian  forest. 

Among the physical mechanisms which would be responsible for this behaviour, we could 

mention the influence of the coherent magnetic  vortices, studied by  Kinney  et  al. (1995). 

As a consequence of this influence we did not observe good agreement between theoretical 

and  experimental  PDFs  for  the  year  2000  solar  wind  velocity  time  series.  Through  the 

analysis  of  the  skewness  parameter  related  to  solar  wind  time  series,  we  observed  high 

values  of  this  parameter.  The  energy  necessary  to  provide  the  increase  in  the  skewness 

values  was  due  to  the  increase  of  disturbances  during  this  year.  By  Global  Wavelet 

Spectrum (GWS) analyses, these disturbances increase the energy in lower periods for both 

the  time-series  in  2000,  but  being  much  efficient  in  the  solar  wind  velocity  time-series. 

These periods were approximately 9, 13 and 26 days. Taking into account these results we 

have  shown  that  the  generalized  thermostatistics  approach  combining  GWS  analysis 

provides a simple and accurate framework for  modeling the statistical behavior of  MHD 

turbulence involved in the solar-terrestrial plasma dynamics.

Abstract 

The work function is embedded in the equation describing the relationship between the 
constant volume and constant pressure heat capacities.  The modification of the work function 
results that the relationship between these quantities must be changed accordingly.  Using the 
newly derived work functions of elastic solids the description of the heat capacities and the 
relationship between the heat capacities are given for solid phase. 
 

The molar heat capacity 

represents the energy required to raise the temperature of one

moles, T is the temperature, and q is the heat supplied to the system.  The energy added to the 

system can be utilized as thermal energy or mechanical work.  The differential of the heat 

supplied to the system comprises both the thermal and work related energies.  The 

thermodynamic conditions affects only the work related heat while the thermal related part 

remains unchanged regardless of the conditions.

where 

pVα  is the volume coefficient of thermal expansion and

study the thermodynamic description of the heat capacities and the relationship between the heat 

capacities will be investigated in detail in solid phase. 

Investigating solids in a state of equilibrium it has been demonstrated that correlation between 

the temperature and the pressure can exist only at constant volume3.  This correlation is 
irreversible and works in the temperature pressure direction.  The limited communication 

between the temperature and the pressure put constraints on the conversion of the thermal and 

the mechanical energies.  In solid phase the pressure correlates to the elastic related volume 

change while the temperature to the thermal related volume change.  These volume changes are 

not compatible with the exception of constant volume condition when the expanded volume 

converts completely to compressed volume.  Based on theoretical consideration it had been 

suggested that the thermal related volume change do not result mechanical work.  Separating the 

thermal and elastic related volume changes the work functions for each of the thermodynamic 
conditions have been derived4. 

Since only the elastic volume change results work in solid phase the molar work heat capacity 

should be written as :

The temperature and pressure dependence of the molar work heat capacities and their 

relationship to each other is shown on Fig. 1. 

Using the conventional approach [Eq. (20)] and calculating the molar volume heat capacities 

from experiments the theoretical and experimental values did not show good agreement for 
different minerals5.  The inconsistencies might be resulting from the incorrect theoretical 
description of the heat capacity.

Abstract 

The  effect  of  a  stationary  electric  field  on  a  water  droplet  with  a  diameter  of 

several  tens  micrometers  in  oil  was  examined.  Such  a  droplet  exhibits  repetitive 

translational motion between the electrodes in a spontaneous manner. The state diagram 

of this oscillatory motion was deduced; at 0-20 V the droplet is fixed at the surface of 

the  electrode,  at  20-70  V  the  droplet  exhibits  small-amplitude  oscillatory  motion 

between  the  electrodes,  and  at  70-100  V  the  droplet  shows  large-amplitude  periodic 

motion  between  the  electrodes.  The  observed  rhythmic  motion  is  explained  in  a 

semi-quantitative  manner  by  using  differential  equations,  which  includes  the  effect  of 

charging  the  droplet  under  an  electric  field.  We  also  found  that  twin  droplets  exhibit 

synchronized rhythmic motion between the electrodes.

In  chemistry  and  chemical  engineering,  the  effect  of  an  electric  field  on  a 

multiphase  system  such  as  an  emulsion  has  attracted  increasing  attention  due  to  the 

interesting behaviors that have been observed; e.g. deformation and breakup of a single 

droplet [1-3], formation of a fiber-like chain of droplets [4], return motion [2] and so on. 

Active studies on the behavior of multiphase flow under a direct electrostatic field have 

been performed  using numerical simulations  and  experimental  methods.  However,  the 

mechanism is still poorly understood due to its complexity, in that the effects of inertia, 

viscosity, surface deformation, and electrohydrodynamic stresses all interact.   

On the other hand, among various kinds of microemulsions, water droplets with a 

diameter  of  several  tens  of  microns  have  recently  attracted  attention  as  a  convenient 

model  of  living  cells  [5-7].  Active  studies  on  manipulation  techniques  have  been 

performed using laser tweezer [8] and micro fluidics [9], where micro droplets simplify 

the physical assessment of fluid behavior compared to centimeter-sized droplets because 

at a micrometer scale the effect of inertia on the behavior of the fluid is less important 

than those of surface tension and viscosity. To examine the effect of an electric field on 

micro  droplets  for  the  purpose  of  manipulation,  we  directly  observe  the  repetitive 

translational motion of micro droplets between two electrodes under the application of 

DC voltage, which reflect the presence of limit-cycle oscillation in real space. 

A  surfactant  (DOPC,  phospholipid  with  a  neutral  head  group,  purchased  from 

WAKO) was solved in oil (rapeseed oil purchased from NAKARAI) by sonication for 

90  min  and  used  within  24  hours.  To  prepare  micro-water  droplets,  2  μl  water  was 

added  to  200  μl  oil  containing  10  μM  surfactant.  Droplets  with  a  diameter  of  several 

tens of μm were obtained after several seconds of vortex agitation. 

A  single  droplet  was  situated  between  a  pair  of  gold  rods  as  electrodes  with  a 

diameter of 100 μm and separated by about 400 μm, and then DC voltage, ψ = 0-100V , 

was applied, where the droplet is charged at each electrode (Fig.1A (a)). We set x-axis 

on  the  coaxial  line  of  the  electrodes  and  the  y-axis  perpendicular  to  the  x-axis,  where 

origin  is  midway  between  the  electrodes  (Fig.  1A  (b)).  We  used  a  phase-contrast 

microscope (Nikon TE-300) equipped with a micromanipulation system (Narishige) and 

a CCD camera that recorded 30 flames per second. 

Figure 1B shows microscopic images of a single droplet between the electrodes at 

100  V.  The  droplet  exhibits  repetitive  motion  without  deformation  or  breaking  up. 

Figure 1C shows a plot of position of the droplet (x-value upper panel; y-value lower 

panel). The droplet moves along the coaxial line of the electrodes. 

This oscillatory motion is also generated regardless of the charge and the type of 

the  surfactant,  for  example  Tween  20  (neutrally  charged  surfactant)  and  DOPG 

(phospholipid with a negatively charged head group). Small air bubbles are found to be 

generated  within  the  droplet  undergoing  rhythmic  motion,  which  indicates  that  the 

droplet  is  charged  by  the  electrolysis  of  water.  The  gradient  of  the  applied  electronic 

field  is  greatest  along  the  line  between  the  tips  of  the  electrodes,  indicating  that 

attractive force on the droplet as a dielectric body acts in the direction of 

0=y

. 

When the voltage is well below 20 V, a droplet is pulled toward either electrode 

and  is  attached  to  the  electrode  surface,  as  exemplified  in  Fig.  2A(a)  (10  V).  At  high 

electrical potentials, “small oscillation” of a droplet is generated between the origin and 

an  electrode,  as  exemplified  in  Fig.  2A(b)  (50  V),  while  small  oscillation  is  observed 

around each electrode. When the voltage exceeds 70 V, “large oscillation” is generated 

between the electrodes, where the droplet touches both electrodes, as show in Fig. 2A(c) 

(100 V). The trajectory of droplet motion is on the coaxial line between the electrodes in 

both small and large oscillations.   

At a micrometer scale, viscosity and surface tension should strongly influence 

fluid behavior. To evaluate the most important effect under the conditions in the study, 

the capillary number, Ca, for comparing viscosity and surface tension and the Reynolds 

number, Re, for comparing inertia and viscosity are written, respectively, as

,  L   is  the  distance  between  the

spherical shape is negligible and that the effect of inertia on motion is also minimal. 

In the stationary state, the droplet wets an electrode. It is expected that a droplet 

would move away form an electrode when repulsive electrostatic force overcomes the 

attraction of the droplet to the surface of the electrode due to the surface tension, which 

is written as

droplet, by symmetry,

where  a   is  a  negative  constant,  we  consider  that  the  potential  due  to  the  induced

  at  t=0.  A  droplet  exhibits  stable  oscillatory  motion  between  the 

electrodes and touches both electrodes with large amplitude. Figure 3B shows a plot of 

the  amplitude  of  oscillatory  motion.  A  droplet  exhibits  a  stationary  mode  below  20 V 

and two types of modes of repetitive motion, small and large oscillations, exist at 20-70 

V and 70-100 V, respectively, where in the transition between the modes the amplitude 

changes  in  a  discrete  manner  and  the  transition  between  small  and  large  oscillations 

occurs with spontaneous spatial symmetry breaking. 

We also found that twin droplets simultaneously exhibit rhythmic motion without 

coalescence  along  the  coaxial  line  between  the  electrodes  at  100  V  as  exemplified  in 

Fig.4,  suggesting  that  the  droplets  exchange  charge  when  they  touch  each  other.  It  is 

noted that, in Fig.4, these two oscillatory motions synchronize each other in the mode of 

in-phase, where the amplitudes are different each other. 

In the experiments, the droplets would scarcely fuse together probably due to the 

charge of the droplets. The droplets convey electrons by engaging in rhythmic motion 

between the electrodes and by exchanging the charge when they touch each other, where 

the  charge  exchanged  is  determined  in  accordance  with  the  Laplace  Equation  with 

boundary conditions. The orbits of the droplets are confined to the coaxial line for the 

same reason as in the case of a single droplet. In addition, more than two droplets, to a 

tested  maximum  of  five  droplets,  exhibit  synchronized  rhythmic  motion  in  a  similar 

fashion.  It  is  difficult  to  precisely  predict  the  motion  of  multiple  droplets  that  exhibit 

rhythmic motion due to their mutual electric interaction. 

We  have  shown  that  periodic  oscillatory  motion  is  generated  for  micro  water 

droplets in oil under a DC electronic field. The droplets are confined to the coaxial line 

between the tips of the electrodes, which suggests that this experimental system may be 

applicable as a prospective method for manipulation. The novel oscillation phenomenon 

observed  in  the  present  study  may  be  associated  with  some  aspects  in  the  dynamic 

behavior in living cells, where thermodynamically open conditions are essential.

Abstract 

A  model  of  precursor  manifestation  mechanisms,  stimulated  by  tectonic  activity  and 
some  peculiarities  of  observer  strategy,  whose  main  task  is  the  effective  measurement  of 
precursors  in  the  spatial  area  of  their  occurrence  on  the  Earth’s  daylight,  are  considered.  In 
particular, the applicability of Dobrovolsky’s approximation is analyzed, when an unperturbed 
medium (characterized by the simple shear state) and the  
area of tectonic activity (local inhomogeneity caused by the change only of shear modulus) are 
linearly elastic, and perturbation, in particular, surface displacement is calculated as a difference 
of  the  solutions  of  two  independent  static  problems  of  the  theory  of  elasticity  with  the  same 
boundary condition  on  the  surface. Within the framework of this approximation a formula for 
the spatial distribution (of first component) of magnetic field variations caused by piezomagnetic 
effect in the case of perturbed regular medium, which is in simple shear state is derived. Cogent 
arguments in favor of linear dependence between the radon spatial distribution and conditional 
deformation are obtained.   

Changes  in  magnetic  field  strength  and  radon  concentrations  were  measured  along  a 
tectonomagnetic  profile  of  the  total  length  of  11  km  in  the  surroundings  of  the  “Academic ian 
Vernadsky” Station  on the  Antarctic Peninsula (W 64(cid:176) 16´, S 65°15´). Results showed a positive 
correlation between the annual surface radon concentration and annual changes of magnetic field 
relative to a base point, and also the good coincidence with theoretical calculation.

1. Introduction 

 

The information about the concentration of radon isotopes and radon daughters  in 

the  air  and  soil  is  actively  used  all  over  the  world  for  geophysical  purposes  (Åkerblom 

and Mellander, 1997; Hakl et al., 1997; Fleischer et al., 1997; Monnin and Seidel 1997; 

Khan  et  al.,  1977;  Balcázar,  1997;  Guera  and  Lombardi,  2001;  Zmazek  et  al.,  2003; 

Kharatain  et  al.,  2002;  Majudar,  2004).  Monitoring  the  tectonic  activity  of  the  Earth's 

crust is performed on the basis of several geophysical and chemical methods, including 

determination  of  the  radon  concentration  in  soil  gas  and  in  underground  water  (e.g. 

Monnin  and  Siedel,  1991).  The  applicability  of  radon  is  based  on  the  fact  that  the  high 

temperature  of  aquifers  or  geothermal  water  sources,  which  are  neighbors  of  natural 

breaks,  promotes  the  transport  of  radon  upward  along  existing  and/or  forming  breaks 

(Segovia,  1991;  Singh  et  al.,  1991;  Durrani  and  Ilic,  1997).  Measurement of the radon 

concentration is widely used in seismic testing areas to study active tectonic breaks and 

earthquake precursors. It is considered that radon is removed by underground waters from 

cracks  in  the  Earth’s  crust  just  made  in  deformation  processes.  The  close  correlation  of 

changes of radon concentration with time in underground  waters with  movements of the 

Earth’s  crust  before  earthquakes  is  evidence  of  that.  According  to  an  analogous 

mechanism,  the  zones  of  active  tectonic  breaks  are  characterized  by  anomalous  radon 

concentration. 

Study of the tectonic activity in the region of the location of the “Academician 
Vernadsky” Antarctic station (W 64(cid:176) 16´, S 65°15´) is important because large and deep 

breaks  were  revealed  near  the  station.    Furthermore  the  recent  eruptive  activity  on 

Deception  Island  and  neovolcanic  zone  along  of  Bransfield  Strait  show  the  high 

geodynamic activity on the North of our region (Smellie, 1988). The distance between the 

southern earthquakes in  Bransfield Strait rift propagation and Vernadsky station is about 

230 km.  

Present geodynamic and seismic tectonic processes, in particular in break zones, 

lead  to  changes  of  mechanical,  electrical,  magnetic  and  other  properties  of  rocks.  The 

physical  mechanisms  of  their  influence  on  the  variation  of  magnetic  field  are  due  to 

piezomagnetism  and  electrokinetic  effects.  As  a  result,  the  temporary  changes  of 

geomagnetic  field  occur  with  the  periods  from  a  few  weeks  to  several  years,  and  the 

amplitudes  from  1  to  several  tens  of  nT.  These  geomagnetic  field  variations  due  to  the 

 

2 

piezomagnetic  effect,  which  are  produced  by  tectonomagnetic  anomalies,  are  the 

indicators  of  active  geodynamic  processes  (current  movements  of  the  Earth's  crust, 

earthquakes,  vulcanization, etc.). They can be revealed by repeated and precise magnetic 

measurements (Skovorodkin et al., 1985).  

The  present  work  has  a  twofold  aim.  First,  it  is  a  long-term  study  of  local 

temporary  changes  of  geomagnetic  fields  caused  by  different  physical  and  chemical 

processes in the Earth's crust. Secondly, it is a search for a correlation between the radon 

concentration,  which  reflects  the  tectonic  activity  of  the  Earth's  crust,  and  temporary 

changes of the abnormal magnetic field. Our results obtained so far are summarized in the 

present paper. 

2. Theory 

It  is  well  known  that  the  tectonic  processes  due  to  regular  deformation  of  the 

Earth crust are the main cause of existent background deformation field.  

We consider that unperturbed medium is at background deformation field, which 

is supported by corresponding (regional) tectonic processes. We also consider that there 

is  the  volume  V  of  tectonic  activity,  in  other  words,  non-regular  deformation  volume 

inside  a  large  unperturbed  medium  limited  by  the  sur face  S=S0+S1 (Fig 1). This  local 

volume  has  changed  properties  (heterogeneity),  which  causes  the  corresponding 

perturbations of different geophysical fields in the  Earth crust. Traditionally we call such 

perturbations as “precursors”. The main, or more exactly, primary precursor of tectonic 

activity  is  a  so-called  mechanical  precursor,  i.e.  medium  deformation,  exceeding 

background deformation. All the other precursors including those discussed in this paper 

-  anomalies  of  radon  concentration  and  magnetic  va riations  -  are  the  secondary  in 

respect of Earth crust deformations. 

A  model  describing  mechanisms  of  precursor  manifestations  stimulated  by 

tectonic  activity  and  some  peculiarities  of  observation  strategy  for  effective  precursor 

measurements  in  spatial  zone  of  their  manifestation  on  the  daylight  of  the  Earth  is 

presented below. 

2.1 The distributions of deformations and radon concentrations 

We define a zone of precursor activity manifestation as a part of  daylight, which 

contains  the  epicenter  of  tectonic  stress  and  is  limited  by  a  line  where  precursor 

perturbations  are  of  the  same  magnitude  as  the  background  variations.  Taking  into 

 

3 

account  this  definition  let  us  consider  the  construction  of  deformation  distribution  on 

daylight for a typical case of tectonic activity. Note that the main idea of such problem 

solution (excluding some modification of process phenomenology) is completely based 

on Dobrovolsky theory of seismic focus evolution (Dobrovolsky, 1984).  

As  it  stated  above,  the  Earth  crust  moves  with  approximately  constant  (on 

regional  scale)  strain  rate,  which  maintains  a  constant  (in  mentioned  sense)  level  of 

shearing  stress  against  a  background  of  almost  hydrostatical  stress  field  due  to 

gravitation.  

A  viscous-elastic  medium  is  the  simplest  model  of  continuous  medium,  which 

reflects  the  stated  properties.  However  the  high  effective  viscosity  of  the  Earth  core 
(which is  1020 - 1022 Pa/s according to different estimates), relatively short duration of 

investigated processes (1 - 10 years) and necessity  to study the difference of states rather 

than  the  characteristics  of  absolute  state  make  it  possible  to  introduce  a  following 

simplification.  We  consider  an  approximation,  when  the  unperturbed  medium  and  the 

volume of tectonic activity (local heterogeneity) are linearly elastic and the perturbation 

is  calculated  as  the  difference  of  the  solutions  of  two  separate  statistical  problems  of 

theory  of  elasticity  with  the  same  boundary  conditions  on  surface  (Fig.  1).  Equal 

boundary  conditions  stipulated  by  the  fact  that  the  energy  of  tectonic  processes 

considerably  exceeds  the  increment  of  the  energy  due  to  the  formation  of  the  area  of 

increased  tectonic  activity  and  therefore  the  appearance  of  local  heterogeneity  cannot 

distort the regular tectonic processes far off its hypocenter. 

Let  us  consider  half-space  ?3  =  0,  which  contains  homogeneous  and  isotropic 

medium. The problem is set in rectangular coordinates xi (the comma of the lower index 

denotes  differentiation  by  corresponding  spatial  coordinate  and  the  recurring  indexes 

cause  summation).  In  the  general  case,  at  small  a,  which  characterize  the  weight  of 

perturbed  part  of  elastic  modulus,  the  perturbed  displacements  wr  of  such  medium  are 

described by Dobrovolsky's formula (1984)

It turns out that the perturbed displacements, Eq. (4), with allowance of Eq. (5) 

can  be  calculated  in  elementary  functions  in  case,  when  area  V  is  a  parallelepiped 

(Dobrovolsky and  Mjachkin, 1976). It is also shown ibidem  that  for  areas having more 

complex form or for points located outside of area V, sufficiently far from this area, it is 

convenient to calculate  wr  approximately,  substituting  the  integrand  by  its  value  in  the 

some  internal  point  of  volume,  which  coincides  with  the  center  of  area  V,  when  it  is 

symmetric  (monopole   approximation).  Note  that  the  error  of  such  approximate 

calculation is less than a few percents even in epicentre zone in comparison with exact 

solution (Dobrovolsky and Mjachkin, 1976). 

Let  us  place  the  centre  of area  V at point (0,  0,  H)  and  introduce  the  following 

designations

change of elementary magnetic dipole, due to the variation of the  magnetic moment of 

every volume element. The total effect may be calculated by integration by full volume.   

Note that  systematic study of this phenomenon showed that under conditions of 

increased tectonic activity (including processes of earthquake preparation) the magnetic 

field  variations  are  appeared.  These  variations  are  really  determined  by  the  above-

mentioned  processes  and  may  be  caused  by  piezomagnetic  effect  (Breiner,  1964; 

Skovorodkin,  1985;  Maksimchuk  et  al.,  2003).  Moreover 

the  expression  for 

piezomagnetism describing was obtained by Johnston (1973), but it is represented in co-

ordinates coinciding with principal axes of stress tensor, i.e.

written in a more handy form. Really, there is an obvious equality

Here  the  expression  in  brackets  is  the  deviator  of  stress  tensor  in  principal  axes.  If 

deviator components are expressed as sij, the Eq. (16) has the following form

3. Experimental1 

The 

tectonomagnetic 

investigations 

in 

the  vicinity  of  the  “Academician 

Vernadsky”  station  began  in  1998  along  the  sublatitudinal profile  Barchans  Islands  – 
Rasmussen point (Fig.2). In 2001 the first data about  geomagnetic field  D F time changes 

were reported in (Maksymuchuk et al., 2002). The next  cycle of observations was carried 

out in 2002 and extended by addition of new tectonomagnetic sites of observation. The 

fourth,  fifth  and  sixth  measurements  were  performed  in  2003,  2004  and  2005, 

respectively  (Maksymuchuk  et  al.,  2004,  2006).  Detailed  results  of  these  investigation 

will be published elsewere (Maksymuchuk et al., 2006). 

The  measurement of radon concentrations was performed  at several sites close to 

the sites of  tectonomagnetic  observations  along  the  Barchans-Rasmussen  profile.  The se 

measurements was started during  the 7th season Ukrainian Antarctic Expedition in 2002. 

It should be mentioned that in 2003  the Rn laboratory was set up  close to the base point 

(BP),  where  continuous  Rn  measurements  with  an  active  Rn  monitor  were performed 

(Ilic  et  al.,  2005).  In  2004  an  improved  Rn  monitoring  procedure  for  etched  track 

detectors  was  introduced and  3  additional  continuous  Rn  devices  were  set  up  to  extend 

Rn studies to other topics (Rusov et al., 2006). 

3.1. Site 

The" Academician Vernadsky” Antarctic station (the former UK station “Faraday”) 

is  located  on  Galindez  Island  (Archipelago  of  the  Argentine  Islands),  part  of  the  West 

Pacific Shelf of the Antarctic Peninsula (fig.2).  The Antarctic Peninsula with its adjacent 

Islands forms a part of the West Antarctic folded system, which extends along the Pacific 

Coast  of  Western  Antarctica.  The  origin  of  the  Antarctic  Peninsula  is  located  in  the 

southern  part  of  the  jointing  zo ne  of  two  large-scale geological structures  – the Pacific 

and Gondvana segments  – of the Earth. It is a result of long-time interaction of tectonic 

processes,  which  are  peculiar  to  each  of  these  planetary  segments  and  cause  their  main 

peculiarities as a whole. The deep trench of the Wedell Sea and its outlying western and 

                                                                 
1 The experiments were carried out during the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Ukrainian Antarctic 
Expeditions in March 2002, March 2003, March 2004 and March 2005, respectively.

southwestern  shelf  belong  to  the  Gondvana  segment.  At  the  present  stage  of  evolution, 

the deep ocean trench and marine shelf area, as well as the Antarctic Peninsula with its 

adjacent islands and lands, belong to the Pacific Segment.  

The  evidence  of  the  geodynamic  activity  of  the  region  is  neovolcanic  zones and 

seismic activity in Bransfield Strait.  The South Shetland Trench, which lies to   N-W part 

of  the  South  Shetland  Islands,  is  the  sole    remnant  zone  of  the  subduction  zone  that 

existed  along  the  entire  Pacific  margin  of  West  Antarctica  during  the  Mesozoic  and 

Cenozoic [Baker, 1982]. Most of the subduction zone was progressively eliminated as the 

Phoenix-Antarctic spreading center was  subducted beneath the Antarctic Peninsula. Slow 

subduction  of  the  former  Phoenix  Plate  appears  to  continue  today  within  what  is 

essentially a single Antarctic plate, owing to slab-pull  forces and/or trench rollback   The 

seismic, multibeam bathymetry and geodetic surveys data indicates that Bransfield Strait 

is undergoing active extension with the rate of ~10 mm/yr in direction orthogonal to the 

strait’s  strike  [Chisteson  et  al.,  2003].  The  modern  eruptive  activity  observed  on 

Deception Island extends along  this neovolcanic zone. 

 The most part of the western Antarctic Peninsula is represented by Meso-Cenozoic 

intrusive complex and Jurassic-Cretaceous calk-alkaline  AP  Volcanic  Group. The oldest 

rocks in Argentine Islands Archipelago are laves and pyroclastic  members of the Upper 

Jurassic  Volcanic  Group  which  have  been  intruded  by  pre-Andian  dykes  and  sills.  The 

Andean  Intrusive  Suite  has  metamorphosed  and  metasomatized  the  volcanic  and 

hypabyssal  rocks.  There  is  a  later  dyke  phase  which  cuts  both  of  volcanic  and plutonic 

rocks. Finally, there are a few late comparatively unaltered Tertiary dykes.   Whereas the 

Argentine Islands  are composed entirely of the volcanic rocks (andesite laves and dacite 

pyroclastic rocks) the western part of archipelago occur the Andean Intrusive Suite rocks 

represented by granodiorites.   

The  tectonomagnetic  points  of  observation  were  selected  mainly  in  the  Argentine 

Islands  Archipelago  (Fig.  2,  Table  1).  Two  tectonomagnetic  profiles  could  be  chosen 

here:  a  latitudinal  profile  (Barcha ns  Islands  –  Rasmussen  point),  and  a  meridian  profile 

(Berselot Island – Booth Island ). The total length of latitudinal profile is 11 km (having 7 

observation  points,  denoted  by  I  –  I  in  Fig.  2).  The  profile  from  W  to  E  crosses  the 

volcanic and plutonic rocks with the probably fault zone between them, the fault between 

Argentine Islands Archipelago and Antarctic Peninsula in Penola Strait which well traced 

in bathymetry and reaches the Antarctic Peninsula on the East.

3.2. Monitoring of tectonomagnetic anomalies 

Tectonomagnetic  anomalies,  defined  as  abnormal 

temporary  changes  of 

geomagnetic field due to physical and chemical phenomena in the Earth's crust and upper 

mantle, are results of changes of seismic, volcanic and other geodynamic processes. The 

study  of  such  changes  of  magnetic  field  is  connected  with  some  difficulties  since  their 

amplitude  does  not  exceed  several  tens  of  nT  and  the  spectrum  overlaps  with  the 

spectrum  of  variations  of  internal  (with  the  duration  over  11  years)  and  external  origin 

(ionosphere and magnetosphere with a duration from seconds to several years). 

Among  numerous  physical  mechanisms  which  can  lead  to  the  appearance  of 

tectonomagnetic  anomalies,  piezomagnetic  and  electrokinetic  effects  are  the  most 

predominant.  Both  of  these  effects  are  connected  with  changes  in  the  stressed  and 

deformed  state  of  the  geological  medium,  which  lead  to changes of magnetic properties 

of the rocks and variation of the electrical current.  

The  piezomagnetic  effect  is  manifested  by  a  change  of  the  magnitude  and  space 

distribution of the magnetization vector due to mechanical loading in the range of elastic 

deformation.  Electrokinetic  phenomena  appear  in  an  electrically  neutral  system  as  a 

whole and consist of the displacement of one phase (liquid or solid) by another under the 

influence of an external electric field, or in the appearance of an electrical current due to 

phase displacement under mechanical stress.  

Theoretical  calculation  of  the  anomalous  effects  for  both  mechnisms  gave 
approximate estimates, which showed that the changes of magnetic field  D F can vary in 

the range  from 0.1 to 10 nT with pressure variations of 1  - 100 bars/year  (Maksymuchuk 

et al., 2001). Besides this, the anomalous effects strongly depend on the depth and shape 

of  the  heterogeneities,  element  contents,  magnetic  and  electric  properties, etc. It should 

be noted that the pressure, even in strong earthquakes, does not exceed 100 bar.  

The  classical  method  for  detection  of  tectonomagnetic  anomalies  is  based  on 

measurements Earth's magnetic field at a constant set of the observation points in definite 

subsequent time intervals. Usually, for technical reasons, the absolute value of the Earth's 

magnetic  field  vector  F  is  measured.  In  order  to  avoid  the  influence  of  external  field 

changes,  the  work  was  performed  according  to  the  scheme  of  synchronous  differential 

measurements of the field FBP at a base point (BP) and the field Fn at given ordinary point 
(n) of observation. The field difference  D F = Fn - FBP is  independent of  the external field 

influence for small distances (10 - 30 km) between the base and ordinary points. Thus the  

 

13 

parameter  sought  is  D

D F  i.e. the  change of  D F  during  the  period  between  the  cycles  of 

observations defined as  

(36) 
where D FY and D FY-1 are the measured values of D F in the year Y and Y-1 respectively.  

D F = D FY - D FY-1 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  interval  between  the  cycles  of  measurements  is  determined  by  the  problem 

under  study  and  the  parameters  of  the  phenomena,  and  can  amount to  days,  months  or 

years.  Taking  into  account  the  climatic  conditions  of  Antarctica  (Archipelago  of  the 

Argentine  Islands),  it  is  most  convinient  to  make  measurements  once  a  year,  i.e.  the 

studied tectonomagnetic effects have a period of about one year.  

As  the  base  point  of  observation  we  used  the  Argentine  Islands  (AIA)  magnetic 

observatory, where F was recorded by MB-01 proton magnetometer with a sensitivity of 

  0.1  nT.  Measurements  of  the  field  at  the  set  of  ordinary  points  were  performed  by  

MPP-203 proton  magnetometer.  The  standard deviation  of  the  field  determination  was 

0.5 - 1 nT. Results of geomagnetic field measurements are summarized in Table 2. 

The  geomagnetic  observations  offered  information  on  the  structure  of  the 
anomalous  magnetic  field  D F  along  the  profile  I  –  I,  and  also  its  time  changes  –

D F.  It  was  found  that  the  D F  is  strongly  dependent  on 

position  (Table  2).  Due  to  discrepancy  of  the  magnetic  properties  of  volcanic  and 

intrusive  rocks  the  differences  of  magnetic  anomaly  were  more  then  1000  nT  with  the 

maximum  in the eastern part of the profile, at Rasmussen Cape (point 7).  In the western 
part of the profile, on Three Little Pigs Islands (point 3), a local anomaly  D F of intensity 
D F2003-02  during  the 
600  nT  was  detected  also.  Dynamic  changes  of  magnetic  field  D

period 2002  -  2003  (Table  2)  varied  from  –  1.9  (Barchans  Islands) to  +4.2  nT  (Three 

Little  Pigs  Islands).  The  definite  regularity  of  their  distribution  along  the  profile  was 
D F.  During  the  periods  2003-2004  Barchans 
noticeable  despite  the  small  value  of  D

Islands and 2004-2005 these values amounts  -6.3 nT  (Three Little Pigs Islands) to +3.3 

nT  (Barchans  Islands)  and  -4.  9  nT  (Three  Little  Pigs  Islands)  to  +6.9  nT  (Rasmusen 

Cape).  The  repeated  observation  of  2003,  2004,  and  2005  confirms,  in  general,  the 
D F  distribution  along  the  profile  I  –  I  observed  in  2002  (Table  2).  Similar 
stability of  D

anomalous effects, but with somewhat smaller amplitude, are the general characteristic of 

active  breaks  in  the  Earth’s  crust  and  were  revealed  in  many  seismoactive  zones  of  the 

world (Maksymuchuk et al., 2002).

3.3. Radon monitoring 

Long  term  measurements  of  radon  concentration  where  carried  out  by  passive 

radon  dosimeter  utilizing  CR-39  and  Makrofol  E  detectors.  For  this  purpose  the  radon 

monitoring  devices  of  the  J.  Stefan  Institute  (IJS),  Ljubljana  (Šutej  et  al.,  1986)  and 

Nuclear  Center  Karlsruhe  (KfK),  Karlsruhe  (Urban  and  Piesch,  1981)  were  used.  The 

dosimeters were placed on the Earth's surface (with the opening of the dosimeter, covered 

by  a  filter,  looking  downwards)  and/or  about  40  cm  above  the  Earth  surface  (the 

dosimeters were fixed on styropore support). The measurements performed in 2002-2003 

by  IJS  dosimeter  is  described  in  (Ilic  et  al.,  2005).  Due  to  technical  problems  all  of  the 

measurements  in  2003-2004  unfortunately  were  lost.  At  each  sites  at  least  7  dosimeters 

were  positioned  to  get  information  on  the  reproducibility  of  the  results.  The  dosimeters 

were  covered  by  a  carbon  steel  oil  drum  (80  cm  dia  and  1  m  in  height,  used  for  200  L 

volume). The detectors were exposed about one year. Before and/or after the exposure the 

detector  foils  were  placed  in  aluminized  foil  to  eliminate  Rn  exposure  during  transport 
to/from  Europe/Antarctica.  The  CR-39 foils were etched in 6.25 N NaOH at 70oC for 8 

hours,  and  evaluated  by  the  TRACOS  system  (Skvarc  and  Golovchenko,  2001).  The 
response  of  the  dosimeter  to  222Rn  is  0.15  (tracks  cm-2)/(Bq  m-3  day).  The  background 
track  density  was  about  100  tracks/cm2.  Etching  and  reading  of  KfK  dosimeteres  were 

performed  in  Karlsruhe.  It  should  be  mentioned  that  due  to  moisture  collections  KfK 

dosimeters  are  not  able  to  measure  the  radon  concentration  at  the  surface  of  the  Earth. 

Average results of radon concentration measurements are given in Table 2.  

4. Results 

The  isolines of conditional deformation  w??  calculated  by  Eqs.  (11)  and  (15)  at 

Poisson’s ratio  n = 0.25 and the average depth of local heterogeneity occurrence  h = 1, 
2, 4 are shown in Fig. 3. Note that sympol h = H/r

 (14). From Fig. 3 it is possible to see 

that the strain distribution is  strongly  irregular. For deformation  w?? the coordinate axes, 

which  coincide  with  the  direction  of  maximal  tangent  stress  in  given  region,  are  zero 

isolines  and  moreover  there  is  an  additional  zero  isoline  in  every  quadrant.  Thus,  it  is 

possible  to  miss  the  signal  even  quite  close  to  the  epicenter  of  tectonic  activity,  if  the 

observation point is poorly chosen.

Experimental results of the annual radon concentration vs. change of difference of 

magnetic field for 2004-2005 are shown in Fig. 4. Comparison of the radon concentration 

values and the tectonomagnetic results shows a clear correlation.  

The following function was fitted to the experimental data (Fig. 4)

constant describing displacement of the base point. It was found that D

Analysis of Figs. 3 and 4 (describing cross-correlation between two precursors  – 

radon and magnetic field variations) shows that the coordinate centre (0, 0, 1) is situated 

near the measurement point No. 3 (Fig. 2) corresponding to minimal radon and magnetic 

field variations. Basing on this analysis and magnetic  measurement data (Maksymchuk, 

2003),  we  plotted  co-ordinates  in  Fig.  2.  (???-??  ?????????  ???.2  ?  ???????? 

?????????). The axis x’ coincides with the maximal tangent stress direction in the given 

region. The axis  y’  traverses  point  (0,  0,  0.9)  close  to  measurement  point  No.  3.  After 

that  we plot the coordinates of all measurement points on conditional deformation field 

at h = 0.9 (Fig. 5). It is found that the radon concentration ratio for the different pairs of 

observation  points 

is  approximately  equal  to  conditional  deformation  ratio  for 

corresponding observation points, which is shown in Fig. 5. Hence we may suppose that 

the spatial distributions of radon concentration and conditional deformation have linear 

dependence

Note such result is in accordance with predictions of so-called dilatation models 

(Kasahara,  1981),  which  well  explain  observed  seismic  precursors  (in  spite  of  the  fact 

that main of them, i.e. filtration (Scholz et al., 1973) and “dry” (Mjachkin et al., 1975) 

models are based on the fundamentally different physical processes). 

This is a very important observation that should be thoroughly tested in further 

experiments.  If  this  statement  is  correct,  it  can  become  a  key  moment  for  the 

understanding  of  the  physical  mechanism  of  radon  emanation  at  increased  tectonic

activity,  which,  as  it  is  well  known,  can  disappears  due  to  slow  relaxation  processes  or 

fast  destruction,  i.e.  earthquakes  (Durrani  and  Ilic,  1997).  In  our  opinion,  one  of  the 

convincing  methods  of  the  verification  of  the  nonrandom  existence  of  stated  physical 

connection  (a  linear  dependence  between  spatial  radon  distribution  and  conditional 

deformation)  is  the  simultaneous  identification  of  the  points  of  observation  relative  to 

spatial distribution of magnetic field variations. 

Since  we  make  comparison  with  the  field  observation  data  in  the  region  of  the  

Western  part  of  the  Antarctica  Peninsula,  let  us  carry  out  preliminary  analysis  of  Eq. 

(35)  as  applied  to  this  region.  Taking  into  account  the  distribution  of  background 

tectonic  stress  in  this  region  (Maksymchuk,  2003),  we  direct  the  axes  x2 and  x1  as  it 
shown in Fig. 2 and axis x3 -

 to the Earth’s center. The absolute value of  geomagnetic-

field  vector  in  the  Western  part  of  the  Antarctica  Peninsula  is  about  39500  nT,  the 
inclination is q1 = - 57(cid:176) 14¢  and the declination is q2 = 16(cid:176) 37¢ .  

Let us place the center of area V on axis x3 as deep as H(

orthogonal zero lines. At first glance, here are possible experimental situations as in the 

case  of  deformation  or  radon  measurements  (Fig.  2),  when  the  signal  is  not  detected 

even in immediate proximity to the epicentre of tectonic activity, if observer's location is 

unsuccessful.  But  this  is  not  the  case.  Below  we  will  consider  this  situation  and  will 

show that it is much difficult and interesting in respect to observer. For that we consider 
the second item D Fr2 of Eq. (28)

Eqs. (29) and (43), which describe the first D Fr1 and the second D Fr2 components 
of  the  total  variation  of  magnetic  field  D Fr,  have  distinction  of  kind.  In  Eq.  (43)  the 

integration is over the all volume of V, therefore at sufficiently large distances from area 

V,  Eq.  (29)  can  be  approximated  by  the  field  of  equivalent  magnetic  dipole  and 
decreases according to  1/r3  law.  As  against  Eq.  (29)  the  integration  in  Eq.  (43)  is  over 

the all volume of regular medium (including the vicinity of the point of observation on 
the Earth’s daylight). The integral in Eq. (43)  has dependence like 1/r2 at R ﬁ

 0, hence, 

it  is  possible  to  expect  that  the  main  contribution  to  field  D Fr2  is  made  by  medium 

volumes  in  the  immediate  region  of  observation  point.  According  to  Dobrovolsky 

(1984), such a property of the  future solution makes it possible to reduce Eq. (43) to the 

following approximation

The  independence  of  D Fr2  on  radius  of  the  distinguished  unperturbed  medium 

following  from  Eq.  (44)  (Dobrovolsky,  1984)  is  an  important  result.  Hence,  in 
homogeneous  fields  of  stress,  the  magnetization  D Fr2  is  determined  by  local  effect 

according to Eq. (44). This means that, when Eq. (44) characterizes the magnetic field 
variations of unperturbed medium close to observation point, the addition  D Fr2 (specific 

for given region)  may be found by the averaging of the sample of measurements, which 

made  exceptionally  on  "zero"  isolines  of  the  spatial  distribution  of  first  component 
variations D Fr1. In other words, the observation strategy for  observation points location 
must not only to take into account the real existence of "zero" isolines  D Fr1 but also to 
use them for the determination of average local addition D Fr2.  

At last, using coordinate system presented in Fig. 2 let us plot coordinates of all 
measurement points on the field of magnetic induction increment D Fr1 at h = 0.9 (Fig. 
7). To ground the choice of value  h = 0.9 we compared the theoretical values D Fr1 with 

the results of field observations in the  Western part of  the  Antarctica Peninsula  (Table 
2). To obtain the theoretical value of  D Fr1 (Eq. (41)) we used such numerical values of 
parameters (Dobrovolsky, 1984): a = 0.1, t = 100 ? Pa, k = 10-7 mT A-1, ? I = 10-8 A Pa-

1 m-1. Then we have

It  is  obvious  that  the  theoretical  value  of  D Fr1  (Eq.  (45))  is  equal  to  the 

experimental  value  (Table  2),  when  b 1  ~  10.  This  corresponds  to  distribution  of 
magnetic induction  increment D Fr1 on the Earth’s daylight just at h = 0.9 (Fig. 7).  

In  that  case,  if  to  neglect  the  second component  D Fr2,  the  ratio  of  measured 

variations  of  magnetic  field  for  the  different  pairs  of  observation  point  (Fig.  2)  is 

approximately equal to  the ratio of the  theoretical values of magnetic field variations at 

the  corresponding  points  of  observation  (Fig.  7).  In  the  same  time  the  experimental 
value of first components D Fr1 in point No 2 (Table 2) is substantially smaller then its 

theoretical  value  (see  Fig.  7).  This  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  in  this  case  it  is  not 
allowed  to  neglect  second  component  D Fr2,  which  (as  it  was  mentioned  above)  is  the 

characteristic  of  the  piezomagnetic  properties  of  medium  in  the  immediate  region  of 
observation point. In other words, the total value of additional magnetic field D Fr1 in the 
point  No  2  decreases by  D Fr2  due  to  the  strong  (anomalous)  piezomagnetic  effect  of 

medium in the point No 2 (the east part of Barchans Island). 

So, we may conclude that the selected strategy of measurements (the dashed line 

of the simultaneous measurements of radon concentration and magnetic field variations 

in Fig. 2) should lead to the strong cross-correlation between the spatial distributions of 
D Fr)  and  radon  variations  in  all  points  of  observation 
the value  D Fr  variations (i.e.,  D

(except  for  points  6  and  7,  which  are, apparently,  the  characteristics  of  totally  other 

physical localization of tectonic activity).  

In  our  opinion,  a  good  coincidence  of  theoretical  and  experimental  samples  of 

magnetic  field  variations  in  this area  and  simultaneous  cross-correlation  of  the  spatial 
D Fr and radon variations is a cogent argument 
distributions of magnetic field variations D

in  favor  of  the  assumption  of  linear  dependence  between  spatial  distributions  of  radon 

and conditional deforma tion  

Finally,  the  comparative  analysis  of  the  spatial  distribution  of  points  of 

observation and their location in Figs. 5 and 7, which describe the variation distribution 

of radon and magnetic field, shows that the average size r of local inhomogeneity along 

the  profile  of  magnetic  measurements  approximately  is  equal  to  r  ~  4.11  km.  We  can 

suppose  that  this  size  is  comparative  to  the  radius  of  local  inhomogeneity  V.  If  we 

suppose  in  turn  that  the  stress  of  this  volume  will  discharge  by  destruction  i.e.  by  the 

earthquake, then, knowing radius  r of local  inhomogeneity V, it is easy to calculate the 

magnitude M of potential earthquake (Dambara, 1966)

In  order  to  determine  an  initial  moment  of  precursor  appearance  let  us  plot  the 

time  dependences  of  maximally  observed  variations  of  magnetic  field   (point  3)  and 

radon  (point  4),  in  which  the  long-term  parallel  measurements  were  made.  From  the 

dependence  shown  in  Fig.  8  follows  that  the  initial  moment  of  precursor  appearance 

dates  from  the  end  of  2003  to  beginning  of  2004.  Within  the  framework  of  dilatation 

models such behavior of precursors (Fig. 8) can be explained by the occurrence of active 

stage  of  rock  shattering  (second  stage  of  seismic  cycle  in  the  filtration  (Scholz  et  al., 

1973)  and  “dry”  (Mjachkin  et  al.,  1975)  models),  which  can  result  in  reduction  of 
magnetic field D Fr and the increase of radon emanation, respectively.   

Thus, basing  on  Eq. (47)  we could expect  at  the  end  of  2005  in  this  region  the 

earthquake with epicenter nearby the Three Little Pigs island and magnitude M = 5.82.  

Several  remarks  should  be  made.  First,  the  stress  of  disturb  area  can  be 

discharged  not  only  by  the  destruction  of  the  Earth  crust,  but  also  by  the  slow 

mechanisms,  for  example,  by  the  creep  along  the  breaks.  Other  mechanisms  are  also 

possible,  for  example,  dislocation  sliding.  If  we  take  into  account  in  addition  that  the  

region  of  Argentine  Islands  did  not  reveal  seismic  activity  during  the  period  of 

observation,  then  we  can  conclude  that  the  earthquake  in  this  region  has  a  small 

probability. 

Second,  the  empirical  equations  of  the  type  (46),  (47)  have  the  statistical 

character,  and  we  can  predict  the  day  of  the  earthquake  on  its  base  only  with  some 

probability, if we even know the day of precursors appearance. Moreover, the constants 

in  these  equations,  which  was  obtained  by  statistical  averaging  of  numerous 

earthquakes,  are  different  in  different  regions  of  the  Earth,  and  are  unknown  for 

considering region.  

5. Conclusion 

Analysis  of  the  theory  and  practices  of  the  considered  above  parallel 

measurements  of  the  spatial  distribution  of  secondary  precursor  variations  (magnetic

parameters must contain following strategy of measuring and data processing:  

1.  In order to plot regional coordinates system, which characterizes the area of 

increased tectonic activity, it is necessary to determine the directions of maximal tangent 

stresses in given region. 

2.  To divide the given region into the grid with array pitch about 1  - 2 km and 

to place measuring devices of radon and magnetic field variations in mesh points.  

3.  Using the symmetry properties of the cross-correlation of magnetic field and 

radon  variations,  to  determine  the  center  of  coordinate  system  (epicenter  of  tectonic 

activity). 

4.  To  determine  the  absolute  value,  inclination  and  declination  of  magnetic-

field vector in the investigated region. 

5.  To plot the theoretical spatial distribution of deformation and magnetic field 
variations (first component D Fr1) considering region characteristics at different (h = 1‚ 5) 

depth of local heterogeneity occurrence (perturbed area V). 

6.  To  plot  on  a  regional  coordinate  system,  whose  center  and  the  axes  are 

selected according to item 3, the coordinates of all measurements of radon and magnetic 

field variations made according to item 2.  

7.  To  make the optimal matching of regional coordinate system containing the 

distribution  of  experimental  measurement  point  coordinates  with  the  theoretical

field when D Fr = D Fr1 + D Fr2 and to make more exact procedure of item 7.

Making all procedures, it is necessary to  take into account all remarks described at 

the end of previous section. 

The  main  conclusion  we  can  make  from  the  above  discussion  is  as  follows: 

studying  the  tectonic  activity  of  the  given  region,  it  is  necessary  to  use  the  complex 

approach  measuring  several  known  precursors  and  using  some  theoretical  model.  Only 

such  complex  approach  can  give  the  base  to  predict  possible  earthquake  in  the  seismic 

regions. Concerning the region of Argentine Islands such approach permits to reveal the 

deformation  accumulatio n  in  this  region  which  will  probably  discharge  by  the  slow 

relaxation mechanisms. 

The cause of such accumulation is still unclear, and it should be analysed using 

all data about the geological structure of the given region. In any case, the revealing of 

deformation  accumulation  in  the  given  region  should  attract  the  additional  attention  to 

this area.

Dynamic  changes  of  magnetic  field  D

D F2003 -02 during the period 2002  -  2003  (Table  2)  varied 
from  –  1.9  (Barchans  Islands)  to  +4.2  nT  (Three  Little  Pigs  Islands).  The  definite  regularity  of  their 

distribution along the profile was noticeable despite the small value of  D

D F. During the periods 2003-2004 

this values was -4.8 nT on the  Barchans Islands, amounts -6.3 nT on Three Little Pigs Islands to +3.3 nT 

(Barchans  Islands)  and  -4.  9  nT  (Three  Little  Pigs  Islands)  to  +6.9  nT  (Rasmusen  Cape).  The  repeated 

observation  of  2003,  2004,  and  2005    confirms,  in  general,  the  stability  of  D

D F  distribution  along  the 

profile I – I observed in 2002 (Table 2). Similar anomalous effects, but with a somewhat smaller amplitude, 

are the general characteristic of active breaks in the Earth’s crust and were revealed in many seismoactive 

zones of the world (Maksymuchuk et al., 2002).

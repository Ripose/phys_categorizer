to the chiral nematic phase of B-DNA: 
 
a molecular model

B-DNA  solutions  of  suitable  concentration  form  left-handed  chiral  nematic    phases  (cholesterics). 

Such  phases  have  also  been  observed  in  solutions  of  other  stiff  or  semiflexible  chiral  polymers; 

magnitude and handedness of the cholesteric pitch are uniquely related to the molecular features. In 

this  work  we  present  a  theoretical  method  and  a  numerical  procedure  which,  starting  from  the 

structure of polyelectrolytes, lead to the prediction of the cholesteric pitch. Molecular expressions for 

the free energy of the system are obtained on the basis of steric and electrostatic interactions between 

polymers; the former are described in terms of excluded volume, while a mean field approximation is 

used  for  the  latter.  Calculations  have  been  performed    for  130  bp  fragments  of  B-DNA.  The 

theoretical  predictions  provide  an  explanation  for  the  experimental  behavior,  by  showing  the 

counteracting role played by shape and charge chirality of the molecule.

I. Introduction 

Solutions  of  B-DNA display  a  rich polymorphism as a  function of concentration, which comprises 
the  formation  of  chiral  phases.1  Many  aspects  of  such  behavior  are  still  unexplained,  as  well  as 
unexplained  are  most  phenomena  involving  DNA-DNA  interactions:  2  3  4  the  most  striking  and 

biologically significant effect is the dense packing of DNA in chromatin. This paper deals with the 
chiral nematic (cholesteric) phase, which has been observed in vivo and in vitro.5 6 7 8 9 

Cholesteric phases are also formed by solutions of other stiff or semiflexible chiral polyelectrolytes, 
e.g.  filamentous  viruses10, 
  or  columnar  aggregates  of 
deoxyguanosine tetramers (G-wires).9 The latter can have different organizations, depending on the 

  polysaccharides  like  xanthan,  11 

chemical structure of the monomeric units; accordingly, cholesteric phases with different features are 

formed. In all cases the relation between molecular and macroscopic chirality is unknown, and any 

simple correlation (molecular helix « phase helicity) fails. An example can illustrate this point. B-

DNA helices are right-handed and form a left-handed cholesteric phase, whose pitch increases with 

temperature. G-wires constituted by the oligodeoxyguanylates denoted as d(GpGpGpG), or dG4, self-

assemble in right-handed columns, like B-DNA; however, unlike B-DNA, they form a right-handed 
cholesteric  phase  with  a  pitch  which  decreases  with  temperature.9  Yet  the  two  molecular  systems 

have  similar  chemical  structure  and  their  chiral  nematic  phases  are  formed  under  analogous 

conditions.  

The stability of the chiral nematic phase is explained by the elastic continuum theory in terms of the 

competition  between  chiral  forces,  which  favor  a  twist  deformation  of  the  director,  and  restoring 
elastic  torques,  which  oppose  the  deformation.12    The  two  contributions  reflect  the  intermolecular 

interactions  specific  of  each  system.  The  elastic  term  has  a  weaker  dependence  on  molecular 

structure, and reasonable estimates, at least of its order of magnitude, can be obtained even in simple 

ways. On the contrary, magnitude and sign of the chiral contribution can change dramatically, even 

for small structural variations; therefore predictions require a detailed modeling of the system. This is 

a  general  feature  of  chiral  properties,  which  are  determined  by  a  tiny  fraction  of  the  whole 
intermolecular  interactions,  with  a  subtle  dependence  on  the  molecular  structure.13  Nevertheless, 
molecular  theories14  15  and  simulation  methods16  able  to  provide  reliable  predictions  of  the 

cholesteric  pitch  of  thermotropic  cholesterics  on  the  basis  of  the  structure  of  the  chiral  molecules 

have  been  developed.  The  case  of  polyelectrolye  solutions  is  more  complicated,  because  these  are 

multicomponent  systems  characterized  by  a  variety  of  interactions  covering  a  wide  range  of 

 

2 

lenghtscales. The early theory by Straley deals with a system of hard helices, whose free energy  is 
calculated  according to the virial expansion truncated at the second term.17 The organization of the 

cholesteric  phase  is  then  determined  by  the  best  packing  of  helices.  For  instance,  B-DNA  should 

form a right-handed cholesteric phase, with a pitch independent of temperature, in full contrast with 

experiment. Subsequently, the additional effect of dispersion interactions between macromolecules in 
a solvent, treated as a dielectric continuum, was introduced.18 However, a theory for polyelectrolytes 

cannot ignore interactions between charges. For example, in the case of DNA each phosphate group 

has  a  net  charge  of    -1e  at  pH~6-7,  which  corresponds  to  a  high  surface  charge  density  of  about  -
1e/nm2.  Recently a thorough analysis of electrostatic interactions between stiff polyelectrolytes has 

been  presented,  based  on  a  detailed  description  of  screened  electrostatic  interactions  between 
cylinders with arbitrary surface charge patterns, embedded in a solvent containing microions .19  This 

theory  provides  a  deep  insight  into  the  effects  of  the  charge  distribution  on  interactions  between 

charged helices. Information about the preferred twist between B-DNA helices can be inferred from 
the analysis of the potential energy surface as a function of the inter-helix angle and distance.20  

In  this  paper  we  present  a  molecular  theory  for  the  cholesteric  pitch  of  solutions  of  stiff 

polyelectrolytes,  which  differs  from  previous  treatments  for  two  main  reasons.  A  statistical-

mechanics  analysis  is  performed,    which  allows  a  consistent  description  of  the  system  properties, 

comprising  orientational  order,  elastic  constants  and  chiral  strength,  and  of  their  temperature 

dependence.  Moreover,  both  steric  and  electrostatic  interactions  are  considered,  according  to  the 

same  picture  which  underlies  theories  developed  for  the  nematic  phase  of  solutions  of  rod-like 
polyelectrolytes,  following  the  Onsager  suggestion.21  Such  theories  are  able  to  explain  the 
orientational  order  and  the  features  of  the  isotropic-nematic  transition,  22    as  well  as  the  elastic 
properties23    of  cholesteric  solutions  of  stiff  chiral  polyelectrolytes,  approximated  as  uniformly 

charged rods. However,  the chirality of shape  and charge distribution cannot be neglected if  chiral 

properties are investigated. The smallness of chiral effects and their dependence on molecular details 

pose  serious  problems  to  the  possibility  of  getting  reliable  predictions.  On  one  side  an  accurate 

representation of the molecular structure is required, but on the other side a detailed description, e.g. 

at the atomistic level, is unfeasible for the complex systems under examination. We have considered 

the case of B-DNA solutions, by taking into account the chirality of shape and charge distribution by 

a  coarse-grained  representation,  which  however  preserves  the  main  features  of  the  molecular 

structure.

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  In  the  next  section  the  theoretical  framework  is  presented  and 

general expressions for the free energy of the system and the cholesteric pitch in terms of  steric and 

electrostatic  intermolecular  interactions  are  reported.  Then  expressions  suitable  for  numerical 

calculations, in terms of orientational order parameters, are derived, through expansion of the density 

function on a set of basis functions. In the fourth section the modeling of the B-DNA structure and of 

intermolecular  interactions  is  described,  while  in  the  fifth  section  the  computational  aspects  of  the 

method  are  summarized.  Then  the  results  obtained  are  reported  and  discussed,  and  conclusive 

remarks  are presented, by  pointing out achievements and limits of this work. To avoid making  the 

text unnecessarily heavy, derivations have been confined to Appendices. 

 

II. Theory  

The twist deformation characterizing a chiral nematic phase is specified by sign and magnitude of the 
pitch of the helix formed in space by the mesophase director  n(cid:1) .  The pitch p, or correspondingly the 

wavenumber q = 2p / p, is defined as positive or negative, according to the right- or left-handedness 

of the cholesteric helix, respectively.  

The  continuum  elastic  theory  can  justify  the  stability  of  the  cholesteric  phase  and  provides  an 

expression for the equilibrium pitch in terms of macroscopic properties of the system. Let us consider 

the Helmholtz free energy density f, which is related to the free energy F of the system by the integral  

For small deformations, the expansion of the Helmholtz free energy density f  in a power series of the 

deformation q can be truncated at the quadratic contribution: 

where f u is the free energy density of the undeformed nematic phase, and

The  cholesteric  pitch  vanishes  if  the  mesophase  is  formed  by  achiral  molecules  or  by  a  racemic 

mixture (with no enantiomeric excess), in which cases Kt=0; it has opposite handedness for pairs of 

mesophases  formed  by  enantiomers,  because  these  have  opposite  Kt    values.  The  purpose  of  a 

molecular theory is the derivation of expressions for chiral strength and twist elastic constant in terms 

of the intermolecular interactions. 

A. Free energy of the undeformed nematic phase 

Let us take  a system of  N identical particles in the volume V at temperature T, interacting through 

hard  core  repulsions  and  electrostatic  interactions.  Manageable  expressions  for  the  Helmoltz  free 

energy of the system are obtained by using a variational approach, based on the Gibbs-Bogoliubov 
inequality:24

B. Free energy of the twisted nematic phase and cholesteric pitch 

In the twisted nematic phase the density function depends also on the particle position, and we can 

write 

(
)Rcrr
)
,W=

(

, where c is the angle between the local director at the particle position R and 

the director at the origin of the laboratory  frame, as shown in   Fig. 1. The lengthscale of the twist 

deformation  is  orders  of  magnitude  larger  than  the  molecular  dimension  and  the  lengthscale  of 

intermolecular interactions. As a consequence, the local phase properties are hardly distinguishable 

from those of the corresponding nematic phase, and  the density function in the cholesteric phase can 

be reasonably assumed to be the same as that in the undeformed nematic phase, with respect to the 
local director  n(cid:1) .27  

 

7 

Thus,  the  free  energy  density  of  the  cholesteric  phase  can  be  expressed  as  the  sum  of  an  ideal 

contribution with the form of Eq. (15), with the Euler angles W expressing the molecular orientation 

with respect to the local director, along with an excess term which has the form:

The  cost  of  the  calculation  can  be  very  high  since  a  large  number  of  pair  configurations  has  to  be 

sampled.  In particular, high accuracy is required  in evaluating 

tK , because this is a small quantity 

resulting from the sum of integrals which are large in value and opposite in sign. As will be shown 

below, each integral requires evaluation of the integrand function for a number of pair configurations 
of the order of 109.  If  the molecule is represented as an assembly of N spheres with M point charges, 
a number of operations proportional to N 2 and M 2 is required for each configuration. It follows that 

the  feasibility  of  calculations  depends  on  the  level  of  detail  employed  in  modelling  the  molecular 

features. 

A. Modelling the shape of B-DNA 

The  function  in  Eq.  (37a)  estracts  the  chiral  part  of  intermolecular  interactions.  Of  course  steric 

interactions will have a chiral component only if the two interacting particles have a chiral shape. On 

the  contrary,  the  presence  of  a  chiral  charge  distribution  is  not  a  sufficient  condition  for  a  non-

vanishing  electrostatic  contribution  to  the  chiral  strength.  Namely,  on  the  basis  of  symmetry 

considerations it can be demonstrated that the electrostatic contribution to 

tK  vanishes for cylinders 

with a helical charge distribution on their surface (see Appendix E). So a chiral shape is necessary to 

have not only a steric, but also an electrostatic contribution to 

tK .  

We have modelled double stranded B-DNA in the following way: a base pair is represented by five 

spheres,  one  corresponds  to  the  aromatic  cores,  two  to  the  sugar  and  two  to  the  phosphate  groups. 

The  centres  of  all  spheres  lie  on  the  same  plane,  perpendicular  to  the  helix  axis  (see  Fig.  3).  The 

DNA  helix  is  obtained  by  a  3.4  Å  translation  of  the  centre  of  the  spheres  representative  of  the 

aromatic  cores  along  a  common  axis  and  a  36°  right-handed  rotation  of  the  base  pair  plane  about 

such  an  axis.  The  geometry  parameters  are  reported  in  Table  I;  a  fragment  of  about  30  bp  of    our 

model B-DNA is shown in Fig. 4. Despite its simplicity, this model can reproduce the main features 

of B-DNA, with realistic dimensions of major and minor groove. This model has been proposed by 
Abascal  and  Montoro29  and  subsequently  used  by  other  authors30  to  simulate  the  distribution  of 

microions around B-DNA. 

 

13 

For polymers with a strong shape anisotropy, like DNA fragments, the elastic constant 

22K  and the 

order parameters weekly depend on molecular details. So, with the aim of reducing the computational 

cost, we have calculated these properties by approximating a DNA molecule as an assembly of fused 

spheres of radius equal to 11.9 Å, with the centres aligned along a common axis, at a distance of 3.4 

Å  from  each  other.  Because  of  its  shape  this  model  will  be  henceforth  denoted  as  the 

"spherocylinder". 

B. Intermolecular electrostatic potential and charge parameterisation 

Electrostatic interactions between polyelectrolytes are mediated by solvent, counterions and salt; this 

makes  their  description  a  formidable  task.  According  to  the  linearized  Poisson-Boltzmann  theory, 

screened Coulomb interactions between polyelectrolytes can be considered; thus, we can write for a 

pair of polyelectrolytes, say A and B:

and  e0    that  of  vacuum.  The  parameter

number,  az   is  the  valence  of  a  ions  and

derives from a mean field treatment of the micro-ion atmosphere, is more satisfactory in the case of 

monovalent  micro-ions,  which  are  characterized  by  weak  correlations;  moreover,  it  is  reasonable 

only for low values of the surface charge density on polyelectrolytes. Actually, at sufficient distance 

between the polymer it can still be used for higly charged polyelectrolytes, like DNA, provided that 

effective charges are used.  
We have used Eq. (38) with effective charges defined according to the Manning theory.  31  So, the 

fraction of uncompensated charge is given by 

=d

, with z equal to the counterion valence, and the 

parameter x (>1) defined as

axis.  For  DNA,    b  =  0.34nm/2  (two  phosphate  groups  with  charge  -1e  at  distance  0.34  nm);  for 

monovalent counterions in water at 25°C, we obtain 

2.4=x

 and d = -0.24. 

As will be emphasised below, most configurations important for the emergence of chiral effects are 

characterised  by  the  presence  of  small  portions  of  the  two  polyectrolytes  in  close  proximity;  an 

example is shown in Fig. 5. The underlying assumptions of Eq. (38) are certainly inappropriate for 

interactions  between  charges  located  in  such  regions.  With  the  purpose  of  taking  into  account  this 

effect,  while  keeping  the  simple  form  necessary  in  the  present  framework,  we  have  introduced  a 

phenomenological hybrid potential, defined as follows. The electrostatic interaction between the ith 

charge (belonging to the A molecule) and  the jth charge (in the B molecule) is assumed to have the 

Coulomb form if their distance (rij) is equal to the contact distance between the spheres bearing them 

(s ij ). For distances larger than a given reference distance (r0), the form of Eq. (38) is assumed, and a 

linear interpolation between the boundary values is taken for intermediate distances:

In our calculations for B-DNA, negative effective charges of magnitude the de have been located at 

the positions shown in Fig. 3, which correspond to the centres of  the spheres representing phosphate 

groups in the model used for calculation of the chiral strength Kt.  

 

V. Computational Methods 

Calculation of the cholesteric pitch at given temperature, concentration and ionic strength requires: 

            i)          evaluation of integrals of the general form Eq. (36); 

ii) 

calculation of order parameters. 

As  explained  at  the  beginning  of  the  previous  Section,  the  first  step  is  computationally  demanding 

and calculations are only feasible if efficient algorithms and optimized procedures are used. Sensible 

choices have enabled a sizeable reduction of computing time; calculation of the cholesteric pitch can 

 

15 

be  carried  out  in  about  a  week  on  a  2000MHz  desktop  computer.  The  strategy  adopted  will  be 

outlined in the following. 

Calculation  of  the  electrostatic  contribution  is  the  most  time  consuming  step.  It  turns  out  to  be 

convenient  to  store  the  electrostatic  potential  generated  by  molecule  A  on  a  grid;  this  allows  a 

reduction  of  the  number  of  computational  steps,  which  in  this  way  scale  with  the  number  of  point 
charges  in  the  polymer  M,  rather  than  with  M  2.  The  need  of  a  grid  dense  enough  to  ensure  a 

satisfying degree of accuracy requires the storage of a huge array. In the case of the spherocylinder 

model, further advantage can be derived from the fact that integration on the 

ABg  variable in Eq. (36) 

can  be  avoided.  Namely,  it  can  be  shown  that  this  integration  has  the  effect  of  transforming  the 

interaction between a point charge on molecule A and all the M discrete charges on molecule B in the 

interaction between the charge on A and M/m uniformly charged rings on B, where m is the number 

of charges which are located at the same height and distance from the cylinder axis. In this case each 

point of the grid represents the electrostatic potential integrated over the 

ABg  angle.  

According to Eq. (36), each term requires evaluation of six-fold integrals (five-fold in the case of the 

spherocylinders). The following integration order is employed:

The  innermost  integral  is  over  the ABR   variable;  calculation  of  both  electrostatic  and  steric 

interactions  requires  the  identification  of  the  closest  approach  distance 

0

configurations.  This  has  been  accomplished  by  using  the  algorithm  outlined  in  Appendix  F.  The 

number of checks, thus the computing time, can be significantly reduced  in the following way: a first 

estimate  of  the  closest  approach  distance  is  obtained  for  spherocylinders;  once  identified  the  large 

spheres in contact, a finer evaluation of the contact distance is performed on a restricted region of the 

helices. Typically, about 40 base pairs  above and 40 below that corresponding to the large sphere are

Namely, for larger distances any chiral contribution is excluded for symmetry reasons, as mentioned 

above. Because of the smallness of the integration range, about some Ångstroms, it is sufficient to 

use  only  three  integration  points;  this  is  a  considerable    advantage  from  the  point  of  view  of 

computing time. 

The dependence of the integrand on the ABg angle is quite irregular for the helical particles, with sharp 

maxima, especially in the case of chiral contributions. A convenient quadrature algorithm has been 
devised in the Romberg method, which allows a non-uniform spacing of abscissas.32 Integrals on the

tK , while 

12 and 24 integration points, respectively, have been used to  evaluate order parameters  and elastic 

constant. Only a single value was sufficient for the aAB angle, because of the scarce dependence of 

the integrals upon this variable.

VI. Results and discussion 

Calculations have been performed for an aqueous solution of 130 bp fragments of B-DNA, for which 
pitch values at different temperatures and ionic strengths are available.8  9 Two temperatures, 286 K 

and  323  K,  and  three  different  ionic  strengths,  I=0.1,  0.2  and  0.5  mol/l have  been  considered.  The 

concentration parameters used for the calculations are reported in Table  II. It has to be mentioned 

that  in  evaluating  the  ionic  strength  also  counterions  are  taken  into  account;  so,  in  the  absence  of 

added salt we have  I= 0.1mol/l for a DNA concentration equal to 200 mg/ml. This point has to be 

taken into account when theoretical predictions are compared with experimental values, because in 

most  cases  the  concentration  of  added  salt  is  reported.  The  parameters  required  to  specify  the 

electrostatic  interaction,  i.e.  the  Debye  screening  constant   

Dk   and  the  fraction  of  uncompensated 

charge  d,  are  shown  in  Table  III;  they  have  been  calculated  at  different  temperatures  and  ionic 

strengths according to the expressions reported in  Sec. IV.B, by taking into account the temperature 

dependence of the dielectric constant of the solvent. We can see that, as a result of two compensating 

temperature effects, 

Dk  is practically the same at T=286 K and i=323 K. The dielectric constant e ¢  

appearing  in  Eq.  (39)  has  been  given  the  value  2,  while  the  reference  distance  r0  =  8Å  has  been 

assumed. This choice corresponds to a distance of 2Å between the surface of the spheres representing 

phosphate groups. 

We shall start considering a hypotetical DNA  solution with purely steric interactions. Of course this 

is not an appropriate model for a strong polyelectrolyte like DNA, but it will be useful to understand 

the results obtained for the more realistic model reported henceforth. Table IV displays the predicted 

order parameters; only values up to the sixth rank have been calculated since, as will be discussed in 

more  detail  below,  truncation  at  this  level  of  the  summations  in  Eqs.  (31-35)  guarantees  a  good 

compromise between accuracy and computing speed. We can see that, under the conditions chosen 

for the calculations, a high order is predicted, with order parameters which decrease with increasing 

rank, but remain non-negligible even at the sixth rank. Table V reports the twist elastic constant

22K , 

the chiral strength 

tK  and the cholesteric wavenumber q. Experimental order parameters and elastic 

constant are not available, but the values obtained for 

2

00D  and 

22K  appear reasonable for nematic 

solutions of stiff polymers.23  The chiral strength 

tK  is negative, this means that steric interactions 

 

18 

drive  the  formation  of  a  right-handed  cholesteric  helix  phase.  This  result,  in  agreement  with  the 

Straley  theory,  can  be  explained  by  considering  that  the  cholesteric  handedness  is  determined  by 

configurations  with  molecules  fitting  into  each  other  grooves  (see  Fig.  5).  So,  a  right-handed 

cholesteric phase is predicted for the system of hard helices; the calculated cholesteric pitch, of about 

35 mm, is about 15 times longer than the experimental value. Of course no temperature dependence is 

predicted for the hard particle system, in clear contrast with experiment. 

When  the  electrostatic  interactions  are  switched  on,  the  results  reported  in  Tables  VI  and  VII  are 

obtained. We can see that electrostatic interactions have a very small effect on order parameters and 

elastic  constants,  which  can  be  summarized  by  saying  that  the  mesophase  becomes  slightly  less 

ordered  and  more  easily  deformable.  The  reason  is  that  electrostatic  interactions  between  equally 
charged molecules oppose their parallel alignment.23  On the contrary, electrostatic interactions have 

a dramatic effect on the cholesteric pitch, since they give a large contribution to the chiral strength 

tK ,  opposite  in  sign  to  the  steric  term.  This  fact  can  be  explained  considering  that  electrostatic 

repulsions  are  maximized  in  those  configurations  which  are  favored  for  sterical  reasons,  because 

charges  of  equal  sign  lie  at  close  distance.  The  electrostatic  contribution  to  chiral  strength  largely 

overcomes  the  steric  one;  therefore  a  left-handed  cholesteric  phase  is  predicted,  as  experimentally 

observed.  Also  magnitude  and  temperature  dependence  of  the  pitch  are  in  agreement  with 

experiment,  as  appears  from  Fig.  6,  where  the  theoretical  predictions  are  compared  with  the 

experimental data reported in ref. 9 (calculations and measurements refer to constant V and constant 

p,  respectively,  but  this  difference  can  be  neglected  for  our  system  in  the  temperature  range  under 

investigation). The pitch lengthens  with increasing temperature (the wavenumber q decreases),  and 

the  reason  can  be  easily  understood  with  the  aid  of  Eq.(22).  We  should  recall  that  the  excluded 

volume contribution is independent of T. The electrostatic term at the denominator is small;  so, as a 

first  approximation,  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  denominator  can  be  neglected.  The  ratio 
Kel(T)  /  kBT    at  the  numerator  decreases  with  increasing  temperature.  It  follows  that  the  relative 
weight of the steric contribution, which plays against a left-handed distortion of the nematic phase, 

becomes stronger at higher temperature.  

Tables VI and VII also report the values of order parameters, elastic constants, chiral strengths and 

cholesteric  wavenumbers  predicted  at  T=323  K  and  different  ionic  strengths.  We  can  see  that  the 

electrostatic  contribution  to  order  parameters  and  elastic  constants  decreases  with  increasing  ionic 

strength; thus, their values get even closer to those obtained for the system of hard helices. Also the 

 

19 

electrostatic  contribution  to  Kt  decreases  with  increasing  ionic  strength,  but  it  remains  much  larger 

then the steric contribution; as a result, a pitch variation of the about 30% is predicted on going from 
I=0.1 and I=0.5 mol/l, a result compatible with experimental data.8 9  

It  is  now  worth  considering  the  effect  of  some  assumptions  and  approximations  used  in  our 

calculations. We shall start from the form of the electrostatic potential, Eq. (39). The introduction of 

the  short-  range  Coulomb  form  is  only  a  simple  way  to  correct  for  the  unrealistic  screening  of 

electrostatic  interactions  between  regions  of    polymers  at  very  short  distance,  and  the  dielectric 

constant e ¢ and reference distance r0  should be taken as phenomenological parameters. The choice 

of their values affects the magnitude of the electrostatic contribution to Kt  and its dependence on the 

ionic  strength.  The  electrostatic  contribution  to  the  chiral  strength  at  T=323  K  and  I=0.2  mol/l  is 

equal  to 

610
-·(cid:8)
501

N/m  when  calculated  with e ¢=2 and r0  =  8Å,  and  drops  to 

610
-·(cid:8)
230

  N/m  if  a 

purely  screened  Coulomb  potential  is  used.  This  corresponds  to  a  larger  value  of  the  predicted 

cholesteric pitch. Actually, e ¢and r0  could be taken as adjustable parameters, to be determined from 

comparison with experimental data. The values obtained in this way would be very close to those we 

have taken in our calculations, on the basis of the reasonable assumptions that e ¢ should be similar to 

the  dielectric  constant  of  an  organic  medium,  while  r0    should  roughly  correspond  to  a  distance 

comparable with the dimension of a water molecule between the surfaces of two polyelectrolytes.     

Another point to be checked is the effect of truncation in the summations appearing in Eqs. (31- 35). 

The magnitude of terms decreases with increasing values of the indices jA  ,  jB, and the series can be 
truncated at a finite value, j max .  This can be estimated by taking into account that: (i) high accuracy 

is required because the integrands are oscillating functions with a number of zeroes increasing with 

rank; (ii) integrals are multiplied by coefficients that increase with rank. We have taken  jA

max = jB

max 

= 6; the contributions of different rank to twist elastic constant and chiral strength are shown in table 

VIII and IX. These are defined in such a way that

this result, which is in accordance with symmetry requirements, gives an indication on  the accuracy 

of our calculations. The effect of truncation on twist elastic constant, chiral strength and cholesteric 

wavenumber is shown in Table X. The non-negligible contribution of terms of rank higher than the 

 

20 

second  appears;  namely,  truncation  at  the  second  rank  would  give  an  error  of    about  100%  on  the 

predicted pitch.   

 

VII. Conclusion 

We have presented a molecular theory and a numerical procedure for the prediction of the pitch of 

chiral nematic solutions of stiff polyelectrolytes on the basis of their structure.  

A statistical-mechanics approach is used to connect phase properties and intermolecular interactions. 

The challenge is represented by the need of combining a coarse grained description, imposed by the 

complexity  of  the  system,  with  a  sufficiently  detailed  representation  of  the  chiral  molecular 

properties at the origin of the macroscopic  phenomenon.  

To this purpose several approximations have been taken. First of all, the intermolecular interactions 

between  polyelectrolytes  have  simply  been  described  as  the  superposition  of  excluded  volume  and 

electrostatic contributions, with the solvent regarded as a dielectric continuum and ions viewed as an 

ionic density which screens interactions between polymer charges. Moreover, charge interactions are 

simply  treated  at  the  level  of  the  linearized  Poisson-Boltzmann  equation,  with  the  use  of 

renormalized charges, defined according to the Manning theory; a phenomenological correction has 

been introduced for non-screened  interactions between the small portions of polymers which are at 

very short distance. Effects of dielectric discontinuity have been fully neglected.  

Calculations have been performed  for 130 bp fragments of B-DNA, by using  a representation of the 

molecule as a regular rigid helix, so neglecting the deviations resulting from its flexibility and from 

the  presence  of  different  base  pairs.  Relaxing  the  approximations  would  certainly  affect  the 

numerical  results;  however  the  picture  emerging  from  our  work  should  not  change,  since  this 

depends on the physical ingredients present in the model. 

In  view  of  all  the  underlying  approximations,  we  cannot  expect  a  strict  agreement  between 

theoretical predictions and experimental data, but this is not our scope. We rather intend to provide 
some  insight  into  the  mechanisms,  up  to  now  unclear,2  driving  the  formation  of    chiral  nematic 

phases in solutions of polyelectrolytes, on the basis of a physically reasonable picture.  

The main results of this work can be summarized in the following way. 

- 

A  model  based  on  steric  and  electrostatic  interactions  between  polyelectrolytes  correctly 

predicts  the  organization  of  the  cholesteric  phase  of  B-DNA  solutions.  It  provides  and  explanation 

for the observed left-handed helicity and for the temperature dependence of the pitch. We would like 

 

21 

to  stress  here  the  importance  of  handedness  in  characterizing  a  cholesteric  phase;  this  point  seems 

sometimes  to  be  undervalued,  as  though  it  were  obvious.  On  the  contrary,  it  has  been  seen 

experimentally  and  explained  theoretically  that  the  relation  between  cholesteric  handedness  and 

molecular structure is by no way simple, and small structural changes, sometimes occurring even in 

the same molecules as a consequence of a change of temperature or solvent, can be associated with 
pitch  inversion.  33  34  35  Thus,  sign  is  an  important  piece  of  information,  which  should  always 

accompany the magnitude of the cholesteric pitch (although experimental determination might be a 

non  trivial  task)  and  should  not  be  ignored  by  theories  for  chiral  nematic  phases.  By  assuming 

reasonable  values  of  the  parameters  describing  electrostatic  interactions,  we  predict  for  the 

cholesteric  phase  of  B-DNA  a  pitch  of  a  few  micrometers,  which  increases  with  temperature,  in 
agreement  with  experiment.  As  pointed  out  by  some  authors,36    knowledge  of  the  temperature 

dependence  of  the  cholesteric  pitch  can  be  extremely  useful  for  understanding  the  mechanism 

underlying this phenomenon of chirality amplification.  

- 

Steric  and  electrostatic  interactions  are  generally  recognized  as  the  responsible  for  order 
and  elastic  properties  of  nematic  solutions  of  stiff  polyelectrolytes;  22    23  37  they  also  determine  the 
alignment  of  proteins  in  nematic  suspensions  of  filamentous  viruses.  38  39  In  both  cases  theoretical 

models based on the excluded volume representation of steric repulsions and a mean field description 

of electrostatic interactions between charged macromolecules have been shown to be able to explain 

the  experimental  data.  Depending  on  the  property  under  investigation,  a  greater  or  lesser  detail  is 

required in the description of molecular shape and charges. A simple representation of cylinders as 

uniformly charged rods can be sufficient in the former case, while in the latter a realistic account of 

the protein structure and charge distribution is necessary. For the prediction of the cholesteric pitch, 

the chirality of both shape and charge pattern have to be taken into account. 

- 

The shape chirality plays a crucial role in our description. Not only it is at the origin of the 

steric  contribution  to  the  cholesteric  pitch,  but  it    is  also  responsible  for  the  emergence  of  the 
electrostatic  contribution.  Namely,  as  already  pointed  out  by  some  authors,  40  41  chiral  interactions 

would  be  washed  out  if  averaged  over  a  uniaxial  distribution.  Within  our  model  it  is  the  shape 

chirality  which  breaks  the  axial  symmetry  of  the  pair  distribution  function  at  short  distances.  It 

follows  from  this  issue  that  chiral  effects  are  determined  by  those  pair  configurations  in  which  at 

least parts of the polymers lie at short distance, so that they can feel each other shape chirality.  

 

22 

- 

Calculations show that steric and electrostatic interactions have a counteracting effect in the 

case of B-DNA, which can be simply explained in the following way. Steric interactions would lead 

to the formation of a right-handed cholesteric phase, as a consequence of the good packing of helices 

fitting  into  each  other  grooves.  However  such  configurations  are  also  characterized  by  strong 

repulsions  between  the  charges  of  polyelectrolytes;  therefore  they  are  unfavorable  for  electrostatic 

reasons. Since for B-DNA solutions the latter effect prevails, a left-handed cholesteric phase results.  

It  is  experimentally  observed  that  the  cholesteric  pitch  of  B-DNA  solutions  is  strongly  affected  by 
intercalators,  groove  binders  and  polycations  like  spermidine.42  43  The  presence  of  molecules 

interacting  with  DNA  is  likely  to  change  the  parameters  of  the  molecular  helix  and  influence  the 

effective  charges  of  DNA.  So,  according  to  our  model  a  change  of  steric  and  electrostatic 

contributions  to  chiral  strength  and  twist  elastic  constant  is  expected,  with  strong  effects  on  the 

cholesteric pitch.   

The approach developed in this work is not restricted to the case of DNA, and could be applied to the 

chiral nematic phase of other polyelectrolytes. In particular it would be interesting to investigate the 

case of G-wires. On the basis of the results obtained for B-DNA, we can attempt an explanation for  

behavior of dG4 aggregates mentioned in the Introduction: as for B-DNA, we expect that steric and 

electrostatic  interactions  should  favor  a  right-handed  and  a  left-handed  cholesteric  phase, 

respectively.  However,  unlike  the  case  of  B-DNA,  the  former  contribution  would  prevail  for  dG4. 

Such a picture should be checked with calculations; a practical difficulty derives form the uncertainty 

about  the  aggregate  geometry,  which  has  to  be  known  with  a  certain  level  of  detail  for  reliable 

predictions of the cholesteric phase organization.

hg is independent of the 

ABf  angle for two cylinders. Therefore integration 

over this variable is equivalent to calculation of the interaction between charged rings on molecule A 

with charged rings on molecule B.  As a consequence the two integrals over the angle fAB are equal 

and their sum vanishes, for any value of the variables

 , for each pair of spheres (i,j) the following 

calculations are performed: 

      1.    the distance between the two spheres ( ijr ) is expressed in terms of the intermolecular vector RAB; 

2.   condition  of  contact  is  imposed: 

ijr s=
ij

,  with s  ij  = (s  i  + s j  )/2,  and  the  closest  approach 

distance for the two spheres,

ij

ABR , is stored. 

At the end of the cycle the largest value of 

ij

ABR  is taken as the closest approach distance

Minimization of the free energy 

In practice, it is convenient to choose as variational parameters, in place of the order parameters,  the 

expansion  coefficients  of  the  mean  field  potential 

mfU W .  This  is  derived  by  imposing  the

The free energy Eq. (G.5) is thus expressed as a function of the coefficients {uj}, and its equilibrium 

value can be obtained by minimizing with respect to these parameters. The use of the coefficients{uj} 

as variational parameters has a twofold advantage: (i) the expansion of the mean field potential Eq. 

(G.4)  converges  faster  than  that  of  the  density  function  Eq.  (23);  (ii)  the  parameters  {uj}  are 

unconstrained, unlike order parameters, which are restricted to the range

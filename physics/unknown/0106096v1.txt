We  report  gravity  oscillations  of  a  liquid  column  partially  immersed  in  a  bath  of  liquid.  We

stress  in  particular  some  peculiarities  of  this  system,  namely  (i)  the  fact  that  the  mass  of  this

oscillator constantly changes with time; (ii) the singular character of the beginning of the rise, for

which the mass of the oscillator is zero; (iii) the sources of dissipation in this system, which is

found to be dominated at low viscosity by the entrance (or exit) effects, leading to a long-range

damping  of  the  oscillations.  We  conclude  with  some  qualitative  description  of  a  second-order

phenomenon, namely the eruption of a jet at the beginning of the rise.

1.  Experiment

A  cylindrical  glass  pipe,  closed  at  its  top,  is  partially  immersed  in  a  large  bath  of

liquid. The experiment consists of opening the pipe, and recording the height  Z of the

liquid column as a function of time  T (Figure 1). The pipe has a  centimetric radius  R

(which  allows  us  to  neglect  capillary  effects),  and  a  total  length  of  about  one  meter.

We note  H  the  depth  of  immersion,  and  h  the  level  of  liquid  inside  the  tube  before

opening. This parameter can be adjusted thanks to a  syringa,  with  which  we  can  add

either some liquid or some air before opening the top. We are interested here in liquids
of  low  viscosity  h

  (such  as  water  or  hexane),  so  that  the  motion  of  the  liquid  is

dominated  by  inertia  and  gravity,  leading  to  numerous  oscillations  of  the  liquid

column.

Figure  2  shows  typical  observations  of  the  column  height  as  a  function  of  time,

obtained thanks to a high speed camera (~ 1200 frames per second). For this particular

experiment, the initial depth was  H = 30  cm, the tube radius  R = 1  cm,  and  the  initial
height of liquid inside the column  h = 3  mm.  The  liquid  was  hexane,  of  density  r

  =

660  kg/m3  and  viscosity  h

  =  0.39  mPa.s.  Both  the  height  and  the  time  are  made

dimensionless  in  Fig.  2,  where  they  are  respectively  normalized  by  the  natural  length

and time scales, namely  H and  H/g , noting g the acceleration of gravity. We note  z

and t these reduced quantities.

Figure 2: Height of the liquid column versus time, for a glass tube (R = 1 cm) partially immersed at a
depth H = 30 cm in hexane. Initially (t = 0), the tube is empty. The height is normalized by H, and the
time by (H/g)1/2.

We can observe in Fig. 2 several features, on which we shall base our discussions: (i)

the  height  first  quickly  increases  (the  typical  velocity  at  the  beginning  is  170  cm/s),
 0.01 for t = 3.0  –
and reaches a maximum zM = 1.52 –

 0.5; (ii) then, many oscillations

are observed, before approaching the final equilibrium height  z  =  1;  their  damping  is
not exponential, since the ratio between two successive  maxima of the function (z -

 1)

is  not  a  constant  (the  four  first  ratios  are  respectively  0.61,  0.68,  0.73  and  0.77,  and
increase with time); (iii) a pseudo-period can be deduced from the data, which is 6.3 –

0.5; this period is quite well defined for the first oscillations, but slightly increases (of

typically less than 5 %) at longer times.

We  shall  first  describe  the  principal  characteristics  of  a  model  recently  proposed  to

analyze the non-linear oscillations of a liquid column. Then, we shall discuss different

effects  such  as  speed  of  invasion,  initial  acceleration  of  the  fluid,  and  damping.  We

shall  conclude  with  some  qualitative  observations  related  to  local  properties  of  the

flow.

2.  Model

A  model  was  recently  proposed  to  describe  the  motion  due  to  capillary  forces  of  a
wetting liquid inside a small vertical tube initially empty (H = 0), in the inertial regime.1
gp R2Z (noting  g   the

liquid  surface  tension).  Here,  the  tube  radius  is  much  larger  than  the  (millimetric)

capillary  length,  so  that  capillary  forces  can  be  neglected  and  replaced  by  the

hydrostatic pressure as a driving force. Hence, the force F acting on the liquid column is

found to exhibit a structure very similar to the one in the capillary problem:

F  =  r gp R2(H- Z)

It  is  very  instructive  to  consider  first  a  situation  without  any  source  of  dissipation.

Then,  the  total  energy  E  of  the  column  is  the  sum  of  the  kinetic  energy  and  the

potential energy U which can be integrated from F (taking U = 0 for  Z = 0). Hence it

writes:

Considering  e  as  a  constant  with  time,  eq.  (3)  can  be  integrated,  which  leads  to

parabolic  oscillations  of  equation:  z(t) = 

2 t(1  -

  t/4 2 ), supposing  z(0)  =  0.  The

maximum,  reached  at  t  =  2 2 , is  z  =  2,  far  above  the  maximum  observed  in  the

experiment  in  Fig.  2.  Furthermore,  this  parabolic  behavior  is  periodic  (with  this

peculiarity,  which  is  that  when  z  comes  back  to  zero,  the  velocity  is  maximum,  but

there is no inertia because there is no mass; thus, the liquid column can bounce) – once

again, in contradiction with the observed damping of the oscillations.

Thus, the second step consists of  analyzing  the  possible  causes  of  dissipation  in  the

system. We could try to incorporate the viscous dissipation along the wall of the tube,

but this should be negligible at short time –  i.e. at a time scale smaller than  r R2/h

, the

characteristic  time  for  setting  a  Poiseuille  profile  in  the  tube.  This  time  in  these
experiments  is  very  large,  typically  102  to  103  in  our  dimensionless  units.  The

negligible  influence  of  viscosity  at  short  time  was  confirmed  by  doing  the  same

experiment with water (three times as viscous as hexane), for which we found exactly

the  same  positions  for  the  five  first  maxima  and  five  first  minima  (within  1  %  in

error).

In classical textbooks2,  one  can  find  that  a  second  cause  of  dissipation  for  a  liquid  of

very  small  viscosity  is  the  singular  pressure  loss  at  the  tube  entrance  (if  the  liquid

rises)  or  exit  (if  the  liquid  goes  down).  This  pressure  loss  is  due  to  the  difference  of

radii between the tank (of huge radius) and the tube (of much smaller radius): because

of  the  abrupt  contraction  between  both,  some  eddies  appears  at  the  entrance  of  the

tube, dissipating a certain amount of energy. This pressure loss is classically evaluated

by  applying  the  Bernoulli  equation  (based  on  the  conservation  of  energy)  and  the

Euler  equation  (based  on  the  momentum  equation)  to  the  liquid  column,  which  does
not  lead  to  the  same  result2.  The  difference  between  these  results  is  precisely  the

pressure  loss.  When  the  ratio  of  the  tube  radius  to  the  tank  radius  is  close  to  zero  (in
our experiment, this ratio is of order of 10-2), this pressure loss  PD
expression2:

 has a very simple

This pressure loss is positive and is simply equal to the kinetics energy of a slice dZ of

the column. The associated energy loss is negative, and has a different sign depending

on  whether  the  liquid  is  going  up  (dZ  >  0)  or  down  (dZ  <  0).  In  dimensionless

quantities, the energy loss thus writes:

Differentiating eq. 3 (and taking no account for the viscous dissipation along the wall),

we find two different equations, depending on the direction of the motion:

These  equations  can  be  simply  derived  by  expressing  Newton’s  law  of  dynamics,

taking  into  account  the  fact  that  the  system  is  open.  For  a  system  of  mass  M  and

velocity V driven by a force F, it can be written:

where Vo is the velocity with which the mass joins (or leaves) the system. For the rise,

 is close to zero (velocity field related to a punctual sink), and  eq. 7 turns out to

be identical to  eq.  6a  (after  making  dimensionless  the  different  variables).  During  the

descent, a liquid jet is expelled into the reservoir and Vo is V, which leads to  eq. 6b.

The  energy  loss  associated  with  eq.  7  can  be  calculated  in  a  very  general  way.  The
energy E is 1/2MV2 + U, noting U the potential from which the force F can be derived

(F =  -

  dU/dZ). Using  eq.  7,  the  way  the  energy  varies  as  a  function  of  time  can  be

deduced. We find:

Eq. 9 is found to be identical to  eq. 5a and 5b. It expresses more generally the energy
loss  related  with  an  entrained  mass  (dE/dt  =  0  if  M&   =  0).  It  thus  concerns  similar
questions such as the bursting of a soap film3 or even the academic problem of a rope

wound on a pulley and drawn by a constant weight.

3.  Discussion

3.1. Constant velocity regime

Initially the beginning of the rise is linear, which can be explained by balancing inertia

with  the  pressure  force  (r gH  p R2)  exerted  on  the  liquid  column.  This  behavior  is

reminiscent  of  similar  systems  with  a  mass  varying  linearly  with  z,  and  driven  by  a

constant  force  and  resisting  inertially.  This  indeed  leads  to  a  constant  velocity,  as
observed  for  the  retraction  of  a  liquid  sheet4,  the  bursting  of  a  soap  film3,5,  the
dewetting of a film of small viscosity6 and the first steps of capillary rise7. Note that in

all  these  problems,  conservation  of  energy  also  leads  to  a  constant  velocity,  but
similarly overestimates the numerical coefficient of this velocity8.

We  measured  the  initial  velocity  of  the  liquid  column  as  a  function  of  the  depth  of

immersion  H.  Since  the  dimensionless  law  at  short  time  (t  <<  6)  just  reads  z =  t,

introducing  dimensional  quantities  implies  a  quick  variation  of  the  column  velocity

with H. Then, equation 11 just writes:

)(
TZ

=

g

TH

(12)

We  did  experiments  with  hexane,  and  found  that  indeed  the  height  Z  of  the  liquid

column  increases  linearly  with  time  at  short  time  (practically  for  t  <  1.5,  which

corresponds to 10 data points). Thus, we could report its velocity V as a function of the

square  root  of  the  depth  height  (Fig.  3),  varying  H  from  2  cm to 35  cm,  and  indeed

found a linear relation with a slope  g , as predicted by eq. 12. Conservation of energy

in eq. 3 for a system starting from z = 0 also predicts a regime of constant velocity, but

with  a  higher  slope  (

g2  instead of 

g ).  Thus  this  regime  of  constant  velocity  also

allows  us  to  stress  the  existence  of  an  energy  loss  in  this  system.  Note  also  that  the

observed  curve  does  not  intercept  the  origin,  which  will  be  shown  to  be  due  to

entrance effect, caracterized by a length of order  R. Thus, our model only holds in the

limit H >> R.

H, the depth of immersion. The full line has a slope  g , as expected from eq. 12.

More generally,  eqs. 6a and 6b show that a solution of constant velocity can only be

found  at  the  rise  and  if  gravity  can  be  neglected  (dz > 0 and  z  <<  1),  or  in  the  case

where a horizontal pipe is connected with the bottom of a very large tank, which only

generates an entrance flow. On the other hand,  eq.  6b  shows  that  the  velocity  is  never

constant during the descent, and the only analytical regime in this case is a regime of

constant  acceleration:  leaving  a  liquid  column  flow  downwards  from  a  very  large
height (zo >> 1) yields:  z&&  = - 1.

3.2. Oscillations, and their two regimes of damping

At longer times, gravity cannot be neglected and  eqs.  10a  and  10b  can  be  integrated

numerically.  This  solution  is  drawn  in  full  line  in  Fig.  4,  and  compared  with  data

obtained with hexane (for H = 30 cm and R = 1 cm).

partially  immersed  (H  =  30  cm)  in  a  large  tank  filled  up  with  hexane.  The  dots  correspond  to
experimental data and the full line to a numerical integration of eq. 10.

The  agreement  between  the  theory  and  the  experiment  is  excellent  during  the  first

oscillations: both the positions of the extrema and the periodicity are well predicted by

the  model.  In  particular,  the  first  half-oscillation  is  the  parabola  derived  in  eq.  11.

After  typically  ten  oscillations,  a  slight  shift  appears,  and  the  damping  is  observed  to

be quicker than predicted. We interpret this “overdamping” as due to the usual viscous

friction  along  the  tube,  which  must  be  taken  into  account  as  soon  as  a  parabolic

Poiseuille-Hagen profile has been established. This is realized  after  the  time  necessary

for  the  boundary  layer  to  diffuse  on  a  length  R,  which  scales  as 

2R

,  with  a

numerical coefficient of order 0.11, as shown in9.  This  time  thus  mainly  depends  on

the  tube  radius,  which  can  be  easily  checked  by  doing  the  same  experiment  in  a

thinner tube. Fig. 5 shows the data obtained using a tube twice thinner (R = 5 mm).

While the first oscillations remain quite well described by eq. 10, it  is indeed observed

that the overdamping takes place much earlier: deviations towards eq. 10 are observed

around t = 15, instead of t = 60 (in agreement with the scaling for the time of diffusion
of the viscous boundary layer, in  R2).

One  of  the  remarkable  features  of  this  system  is  the  persistence  of  the  oscillations

(typically,  more  than  20  oscillations  can  be  observed).  This  is  due  to  the  particular

source  of  dissipation  in  equation  10.  If  the  damping  were  just  caused  by  the  viscous

dissipation  along  the  pipe,  this  would  provide  a  decreasing  exponential  law  for  the

maxima. In the case we are mainly interested in (short time  behavior), the damping is

due  to  the  singular  pressure  loss  at  the  entrance  (or  exit)  of  the  pipe.  The  following

argument  allows  us  to  understand  why  it  is  so  low.  From  eqs. 3 and 5, we can derive

an equation for the energy loss:

Even  if  this  linear  approximation  should  mainly  concern  the  oscillations  of  small

hyperbolic  behavior.  Furthermore,  an  hyperbolic  damping  is  in  good  agreement  with

our  data  even  for  oscillations  of  non-negligible  amplitude,  as  shown  in  Fig.  6  where

It  is  observed  that  (apart  from  the  first  maximum),  the  damping  is  close  to  be

hyperbolic  in  time  (the  full  line  indicates  the  slope  –1),  before  accelerating  (the  two

last points), because of the additional dissipation due to the liquid viscosity. The latter

can of course be evaluated by incorporating in the model a viscous  Poiseuille  friction

along the pipe. If the liquid front progresses by a length  dz,  the  corresponding  energy

loss writes (in the same dimensionless variables as above):

A difference with the energy loss due to pressure entrance is that de (energy variation

z&   and  dz  have  always  the  same  sign.  Taking  into

Unlike eq. 6, eq. 18 cannot be integrated analytically, but only numerically, except in

the  case  of  very  large  W

.  Then,  inertia  can  be  neglected,  and  the  equation  for  the

column motion simply writes:

(19)

which  is  often  referred  to,  in  the  context  of  dynamic  capillary  rise,  as  the  Washburn
equation10. At short time (but large enough so that inertia can be neglected),  z is small

(z <<  1),  and  integration  of  eq.  19  shows  that  the  rise  follows  a  diffusion-type  law:

z(t) = 

W/t

.  Then,  when  approaching  equilibrium  (z  ﬁ

  1),  we  find  an  exponential

relaxation: z(t) = 1 – exp(-

t/W

).

An interesting feature of eq. 18 is that it allows us to predict if the system will exhibit
oscillations, or not. We saw that at large  viscosities (W

  >>  1),  the  system  just  relaxes

towards equilibrium, without any overshoot of the equilibrium height. Thus, a critical
number W

c does exist, below which oscillations develop. Close to W

c, we can  linearize

eq. 18a and 18b, which both give:

where we have set:  z  =  1  +  z

c  =  2,  i.e. for small enough  viscosities.  Written  dimensionally  on  the  depth  of

3.3. Very short time behavior

3.3.1 Starting of the liquid column

Let us come back to the beginning of the rise, starting from  z = 0. We showed that it

obeys  a  very  simple  law,  since  the  height  of  the  column  increases  linearly  with  time

(eq.  12  and  Fig.  3).  An  interesting  question  is  the  way  the  system  finds  its  constant

velocity  V. At  t  =  0,  the  system  is  at  rest  and  there  is  a  regime  of  transition  during

which  the  velocity  quickly  increases  from  0  to  V.  Then,  the  column  weight  is

negligible, and eq. 6a can be written:

&&
zz

+ 2z
&

1=

(22)

This equation has no solution which verifies both z = 0 and  z&  = 0 for  t = 0, because of

the singularity at z = 0 (then, a zero velocity implies an infinite acceleration for  eq. 22

to  be  obeyed).  If  we  impose  a  zero  initial  velocity,  we  must  introduce  an  initial

position z = a. Then, eq. 22 can be integrated twice, which yields as a solution close to

the origin:

z(t)  =  

2
a +

t

2

(23)

This solution has the “good” property to match the solution of constant velocity  z = t,

for t larger than a. It can also be expanded at very small time (t << a), which provides
a regime of pure acceleration: z(t) = a + t2/2a. Thus, as  emphasized above, the smaller

the initial position  a, the larger the acceleration 1/a.

By taking pictures at a high rate (typically 1000 frames per second), we could record

the very beginning of the rise. Such data are reported in Fig. 7. It is observed that the

behavior at a very short time (t < 0.15) can indeed be fitted by a parabola of equation:

14

z(t)  =  ao  +  t2/2a,  provided  that  two  different  coefficients  ao and  a  were  taken  in  the

equation  of  the  parabola.  In  the  example  of  Fig.  7,  the  fit  gives:  ao  =  0.064 and  a  =

0.126. Note that at larger time, the parabolic regime meets the linear one discussed in

paragraph 3.1 (eq. 12).

Figure 7: Height z versus time t, in the very first steps of the rise (R = 20 mm,  H = 30 cm and h =  1.9
mm).  The  data  are  successively  fitted  by  a  parabola  of  equation  z(t) =  ao +  t2/2a  (from  which  the

coefficients ao and a can be deduced) and by a straight line of equation z(t) = t.

The fit can be interpreted in the following way: the coefficient ao  indeed  represents  the

height z(0) =  h/H  of  liquid  initially  present  inside  the  tube,  while  a  is  related  to  the

quantity  of  liquid  initially  accelerated.  Both  are  found  to  be  different  (with  a >  ao),

which  can  be  related  to  an  effect  of  added  mass:  liquid  below  the  tube  is  also  put  in

motion as the column starts rising. Noting L the equivalent column below the tube, the

length  initially  accelerated  is  L  +  h.  Thus,  we  can  deduce  L  from  the  data,  since  we

have a = (L + h)/H, or in real units  gH/(L+h), where both  h and H are known. Because

the  velocity  field  in  the  bath  quickly  vanishes  as  a  function  of  the  distance  to  the

entrance, we expect L to be of order  R, the radius of  the tube. This is indeed the  case,

as shown in Fig. 8, where L is plotted versus  R,  and  found  to  vary  linearly  with  it  (the

numerical coefficient is found to be of order 1).

This result is in close agreement with a prediction  by  Szekeley  et  al.  (in  the  context  of

capillarity)11.  They  show  by  integrating  the  velocity  profile  from  the  entrance  of  the  tube  to

infinity, that entrance effect can be treated by replacing 

ZZ  in  eqs. 6a or 13 by (Z+7/6R)

which yields as an entrance length: L = 7/6R.

We also considered the influence of h on L, and focused on the case of an empty tube

(h ﬁ

 0). Then, as stressed above, the problem should become singular. Practically, it is

not; Fig. 9 shows that L does not depend on  h,  which  is  consistent  with  the  hypothesis

of  an  added  mass  below  the  tube  entrance.  Even  in  the  limit  of  a  tube  initially  empty
(h ﬁ

 0), the mass of accelerated fluid is not zero and the acceleration remains finite.

Since  the  flow  inside  the  tube  perturbs  the  reservoir  on  a  length  of  order  R,  all  the

conclusions  and  interpretations  presented  above  (sections  3.1  and  3.2),  for  which  we

had  Z >>  R,  remain  unchanged.  The  corrections  it  induces  on  the  column  trajectory

16

only  concerns  the  very  first  steps  of  the  trajectory,  in  the  accelerating  regime

illustrated in Fig. 7.

3.3.2 Jet eruption

We  have  up  to  now  focused  our  discussion  on  the  motion  of  the  whole  column,  but

local deformations of the free surface were also observed at short time. Fig. 10 shows

a  side  view  of  the  tube  for  Z  of  about  2R,  where  it  can  be  seen  that  a  liquid  finger

develops at the centre of the tube. This finger first rises and then collapses; we note  A

its maximum height.

tube centre where a liquid finger develops.

The size  A  of  this  finger  depends  on  the  height  h  of  liquid  initially  in  the  tube,  as

shown in Fig. 11. Note that  h  can  even  been  made  negative,  by  injecting  air  bubbles

inside the empty pipe, before the rise takes place.

Figure 11: Maximum amplitude of the liquid finger versus h the initial height of liquid. The experiment
was carried out in a tube of radius R = 20 mm and for H = 30 cm.

For large h (> 6 mm), the size of the liquid finger does not depend on  h. In this regime,

we  still  observe  some  oscillations  of  the  interface  due  to  the  abrupt  contraction
between  the  reservoir  and  the  tube.  Such  oscillations  were  described  by  Taylor12,  in

the case of a tank with an oscillating wall. He showed that free standing waves could

set up in the tank, with a shape very close to the one observed in the tube.

For smaller h, a strong dependence can be observed: the smaller the height, the longer

the  finger.  We  were  interested  in  the  dynamics  of  the  finger  growth.  Fig.  12  reports

different series of experiments.

Figure 12: Amplitude of the finger as a function of time (H = 30 cm and R = 20 mm). The liquid column
starts rising at T = 0 and the finger starts developing at the arrow.

Besides the  h-dependence  of  A  stressed  above,  Fig.  12  shows  that  the  finger  grows

after  some  delay  (typically  0.02  s), whatever  h.  This  implies  that  a  simple  scenario

18

(either a convergence of the flow lines, or a kind of  Rayleigh-Taylor  instability  due  to

the pulse of acceleration at the beginning of the rise) cannot explain the phenomenon.

To go further, we took detailed films of the very beginning of the rise, focusing on the

shape  of  the  front  interface.  A  series  of  snapshots  taken  at  short  time  from  above  the

tube is displayed in Fig. 13.

Figure 13: Set of pictures taken from above each 2.7 ms (R = 20 mm, H = 20 cm and h = 3 mm). These
pictures correspond to the first points (before the arrow) in Figure 12. It can be observed that a cavity
forms and closes, producing a jet (last picture).

These  pictures  show  the  existence  of  a  circular  rim,  which  sets  near  the  wall  of  the

tube, and closes as time goes on. The collapse of this surface wave produces a jet (last
picture of the series), as observed in similar situations13. The speed at which the liquid

crater  closes  could  be  deduced  from  series  similar  to  Fig.  13.  Fig.  14  shows  how  the

diameter D of the liquid crater varies versus time.

Figure 14: Diameter of the liquid crater versus the time (R = 20 mm and H = 20 cm).

The liquid crater closes at a constant velocity, which is 1.3  m/s in the above example,

of  the  order  of  the  velocity 

gH   of  the  rising  column  (1.4  m/s,  in  the  same

experiment).  Note  that  this  wave  starts  propagating  during  the  acceleration  phase  of

the column. We saw that in this phase, the acceleration is of the order of  gH/R (for h =

0), significantly larger than  g.  Hence,  for  a  wave  vector  k,  a  typical  wave  velocity

19

should  scale  as 

gH/kR ,  of  the  order  of 

gH  for  k   ~  1/R.  The  time  needed  for

shutting down the crater in a pipe of radius 20  mm is 26  ms, of the order of the delay

measured in Fig. 12. Then why does this crater establish? The phenomena is probably

due  to  a  sticking  back  of  boundary  layer  and  to  the  associated  formation  of  vortices,

revealed in Fig. 15.

Figure 15: Visualisation of eddies using small bubbles as a tracer for the flow (R = 20 mm and h  = 7
mm).

     

The  gas  bubble  ejected  from  an  effervescent  drug  placed  below  the  tube  provide

indicators  of  particle  paths.  They  underscore  the  existence  of  a  circular  vortex  ring

which  stays  on  the  spot  while  the  liquid  is  filling  up  the  tube.  This  vortex  ring  due  to

the  sticking  back  of  the  boundary  layer  deflects  the  stream  line  from  the  edge  of  the

tube, then creating an accumulation of fluid into a circular ring.

If h  is  negative,  the  initial  conditions  are  different.  Then,  some  air  can  be  trapped  in

the tube creating a vortex ring of air rather than a liquid one (as seen in the preceding

paragraph). This phenomenon could be enhanced by sticking a diaphragm at the tube

entrance, as seen in Fig. 16.

20

Figure 16: Liquid column rising in a tube (R = 20 mm) where a diaphragm (of radius 10 mm) partially
closes the bottom.

The column then takes the diameter of the diaphragm, with a modulation of frequency

184  Hz.  (Note  in  addition  that  the  finger  previously  described  is  still  here,  above  the

main column, as observed in Fig. 16.) The column modulation is probably due to the

stationary  pressure  waves  of  the  air  trapped  into  the  tube.  The  frequency  of  such  a

resonant tube (open at one end and closed at the other) is given by the relation:

fn  =  n C/4Y

where C is the sound speed, Y the total length of the tube (1.6  m  in  the  experiment),

and n the mode of oscillation. For n = 1, we find f1 = 187 Hz, in very good agreement

with  the  measured  frequency.  This  agreement  remains  excellent  if  the  tube  length  is

changed.

4.  Conclusion

We  have  studied  the  gravitational  oscillations  of  a  liquid  column  initially  empty  (or

nearly  empty)  and  partially  immersed  inside  a  large  reservoir.  We  have  stressed  that

this  problem  has  different  analytical  solutions,  depending  on  the  liquid  viscosity.  For

very  viscous  liquids,  the  rise  should  obey  the  classical  laws  of  impregnation  (height

proportional to the square root of time, followed by an exponential relaxation towards

equilibrium).  But  the  interesting  case  is  the  low  viscosity  limit,  for  which  different

features were observed and  analyzed,  focusing  in  particular  on  the  first  steps  of  the

21

rise  (inertial  regimes):  after  an  accelerating  phase  (where  the  liquid  entrained  was

mainly the one below the tube), the velocity of rise was found to be a constant fixed by

the  depth  of  immersion.  Then,  the  rise  was  observed  to  slow  down  (because  of  the

column  weight);  we  have  shown  that  the  trajectory  is  parabolic,  reaching  as  a  first

maximum 1.5 times the depth of immersion. This value confirms that indeed energy is

dissipated  in  this  inertial  phase,  because  of  the  sudden  contraction  endured  by  the

moving  liquid  which  passes  from  a  large  reservoir  to  a  finite  pipe.  After  this  first

maximum,  many  rebounds  were  observed,  which  was  understood  by  evaluating  the

long  range  damping  associated  with  this  energy  loss:  the  envelop  of  the  height/time

dependence  was  found  to  be  hyperbolic  (instead  of  exponential,  as  it  is  the  case  for

usual  viscous  damping).  At  long  time,  viscosity  must  of  course  also  be  considered,

which  provides  a  quicker  damping  of  the  oscillations.  We  finally  described

qualitatively  an  instability  of  the  liquid/air  interface  during  the  first  steps  of  the  rise:

then,  a  liquid  jet  is  emitted  while  the  column  develops.  A  complete  study  of  this  jet

remains to be done.

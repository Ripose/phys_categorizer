Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA), a novel method based upon laser trapping 

and  cooling,  is  used  to  count  individual  atoms  of  41Ca  present  in  biomedical 

samples  with  isotopic  abundance  levels  between  10-8  and  10-10.  ATTA  is 

calibrated  against  Resonance  Ionization  Mass  Spectrometry,  demonstrating  a 

good  agreement  between  the  two  methods.  The  present  ATTA  system  has  a 

counting  efficiency  of  2×10-7.  Within  one  hour  of  observation  time,  its  3-σ 

detection limit on the isotopic abundance of 41Ca reaches 4.5×10-10.

Calcium  is  one  of  the  most  abundant  elements  on  earth,  and  is  of  vital  importance  for  the 

metabolism  of  biological  organisms.  Consequently,  the  analysis  of  its  long-lived  radioactive 

isotope, 41Ca (t1/2 = 1.03×105 year), has important applications in both earth and life sciences. On 

earth,41Ca is produced predominantly as a cosmogenic isotope via the 40Ca(n,γ)41Ca reaction [1], 

resulting  in  a  natural  isotopic  abundance  in  the  range  of  10-15  –  10-14  on  the  Earth’s  surface. 

Hence,  41Ca is a candidate for dating bones ranging from fifty thousand to one million years of 

age  [2,3].  This  period  is  particularly  important  in  the  archeological  study  of    early  human 

development,  and  is  beyond  the  reach  of  14C-dating  [4].  41Ca  can  also  be  used  in  geology  to 

determine the exposure ages of rocks or in cosmochemistry for investigations on terrestrial ages 

and  shielding  of  meteorites  [5].  Moreover,  artificial  41Ca  can  be  used  in  studies  of  calcium 

metabolism in living systems. One interesting example is to use  41Ca tracer to directly monitor 

the  bone-loss  and  retention  rates  of  human  subjects  in  both  research  and  diagnosis  of 

osteoporosis  [6,7].  In  biomedical  applications  the  long  half-life  of  41Ca  translates  into  low 

specific  radioactivity,  and  the  isotope  tracer  can  be safely  introduced  into  subjects  at  an  initial 

isotopic abundance as high as 10-8. 

Approaches  to  analyze  41Ca  at  the  natural  level  have  been  demonstrated  using  Accelerator 

Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at several high-end (energy ~ 10 MeV) facilities [2,5]. However, the 

results obtained so far are not definitive because the natural level is very close to the detection 

limit (~ 10-15–10-13) of AMS. For biomedical applications, where the isotopic abundance can be 

raised to the level of 10-13–10-8, 41Ca analyses have been successfully conducted at several AMS 

facilities [8]. More recently, Resonance Ionization Mass Spectrometry (RIMS) [9,10], a method 

combining  the  selective  power  of  both  laser  spectroscopy  and  mass  spectrometry,  has  been 

applied  to  analyze  41Ca  in  environmental  and  biomedical  samples  [11].  A  detection  limit  of 

RIMS  as  low  as  ~  10-13  has  been  demonstrated  with  metallic  Ca  samples.  With  biomedical 

 

2

samples,  the  3-σ  limit  is  presently  at  4.3×10-11  due  to  the  interference  arising  from  a  high 

concentration  of  41K,  which  cannot  be  fully  removed  during  chemical  sample  preparation 

[12,13]. Compared with AMS, RIMS uses a much smaller apparatus and costs significantly less, 

both advantages are important for practical biomedical applications. 

We  report  in  this  paper  the  first  detection  and  analysis  of  41Ca  using  Atom  Trap  Trace 

Analysis  (ATTA),  a  method  based  upon  the  techniques  of  manipulating  and  detecting  neutral 

atoms  with  resonant  laser  light.  In  ATTA,  individual  atoms  of  the  desired  trace-isotope  are 

selectively cooled in a Zeeman slower and trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) by resonant 

laser beams, and are detected by observing the fluorescence of the trapped atoms. The principle 

of  ATTA  was  demonstrated  earlier  by  Chen  et  al.  with  the  successful  analysis  of  the  81Kr/Kr 

ratio  (~  10-13)  in  atmospheric  samples  [14].  ATTA  shares  with  RIMS  the  advantages  of  lower 

cost and smaller apparatus, and has the potential of achieving the selectivity required to analyze 

41Ca at the natural level. 

In this work, laser cooling and trapping of neutral calcium atoms are performed by resonantly 

exciting  the  4s2  1S0  →  4s4p  1P1  transition  (natural  linewidth  =  34.6  MHz).  The  required  laser 

beams, with a total power of approximately 80 mW at 422.7 nm, are produced by a frequency-

doubled  cw  Ti:Sapphire  ring  laser  whose  frequency  is  referenced  to  a  stabilized  Fabry-Perot 

cavity. The schematic of the atomic beam system is shown in Fig. 1. In an analysis, a sample in 

the form of either metallic calcium or an inorganic compound such as calcium nitrate, Ca(NO3)2, 

is loaded into an oven with a 2 cm long, 2 mm diameter  nozzle. The oven can be heated up to 

1000°C to produce a collimated calcium atomic beam. To reduce the abundant  40Ca beam flux 

the  isotope  of  interest  is  selectively  deflected  by  approximately  5°,  and  transversely  cooled  in 

that  direction  with  a  pair  of  laser  beams  before  entering  a  Zeeman  slower  and  finally  being 

captured by a MOT. We note that each of these laser-manipulation steps is isotopically selective.

By tuning the laser frequency within a few natural linewidths on the low-frequency side of the 

resonance of a particular isotope, only atoms of this isotope are trapped. Atoms of other isotopes 

are either deflected before reaching the trap or pass through without being captured. The number 

of  trapped  atoms  is  determined  by  measuring  their  fluorescence.  Atoms  remain  trapped  for  an 

average  of  18  ms,  which  is  limited  by  a  weak  decay  channel  from  the  excited  4s4p  1P1  level, 

through  intermediate  levels,  to  the  metastable  4s4p  3P2  level.  All  of  the  six  stable  calcium 

isotopes have been trapped and observed in this system [15]. When a metallic calcium sample is 

heated to 570 °C, the trap can capture the abundant 40Ca (97%) at a rate of 5×108 atoms/s with a 

capture efficiency of 3×10-5. When a calcium nitrate sample is used, the oven temperature must 

be  raised  to  750  °C    in  order  to  reduce  the  molecules  to  atoms.  As  a  result  of  the  higher 

temperature the capture rate is lowered to 1×108 40Ca atoms/s and the efficiency to 2×10-7. 

In order to observe the rare isotope 41Ca, the system must be sensitive enough to resolve and 

count single atoms at a sufficient loading rate such that an abundance measurement may be made 

within a practical time period. The frequency difference between the abundant 40Ca isotope and 

41Ca [16], amounts to only 155 MHz, corresponding to 4.4 times the natural linewidth. Despite 

having  selectively  deflected  the  atomic  beam  upon  exiting  the  oven,  the  dominant  source  of 

background  arises  from  the  scattering  of  photons  off  thermal  40Ca  atoms  passing  through  the 

detection region. Figure 2 shows a typical example of the raw data that indicates the fluorescence 

of  individual  41Ca  atoms  in  the  trap.  Over  a  typical  trap  lifetime  of  18  ms,  an  atom  scatters 

photons  at  the  rate  of  3×106 s-1,  2.5%  of  which  are  imaged  and  counted  by  a  photo-multiplier 

detector with an integration time of 8 ms. The signal size of an atom is dependent on the duration 

of time the atom spends in the trap. The average background photon count rate of 209 photons/8 

ms  is  due  to  light  scattered  off  the  40Ca  atomic  beam.  A  threshold  condition,  indicated  by  the 

dashed line, of 5σ

 (= 80 photons/8 ms) above the mean (= 209 photons/8 ms) of the background 

 

4

is  required  for  an  event  to  be  counted  as  a  single  atom.  The  choice  of  this  threshold  setting  is 

determined by the statistical distribution of background and single atom data. The signal-to-noise 

ratio of the largest peak in figure 2 is 17. In order to ensure that we have indeed detected  41Ca 

and  not  one  of  the  abundant  isotopes,  we  mapped  out  atom  counts  as  a  function  of  the  laser 

frequency (Fig. 3). For comparison the nearest stable isotopes  40Ca (96.9%),  42Ca  (0.65%) and 

43Ca (0.14%) were also trapped successively and are shown in the upper trace. The peak of 41Ca 

atom counts occur at 166 MHz above the trap fluorescence of 40Ca, which agrees with a previous 

spectroscopic measurement [16]. Moreover, the absence of counts on both sides of the 41Ca peak 

during  the  measurement  duration  of  six  hours  demonstrates  that  interference  from  the 

neighboring abundant isotopes is suppressed to below an isotopic abundance level of 7×10-10. 

We have analyzed three biomedical samples and compared the ATTA results with those of 

RIMS, which in turn had previously been calibrated with AMS measurements. The samples were 

taken  and  provided  by  partners  of  the  Osteodiet  research  project  of  the  European  Community 

[17].  In  this  program,  subjects  were  given  a  100  nCi  dose  of  41Ca.  Urine  samples  were  taken 

starting  six  days  after  ingestion  up  to  later  periods  of  100  days  and  more.  At  the  ETH  Zürich, 

Switzerland,  these raw samples were chemically prepared into the form of a 3M calcium nitrate 

solution, of which a 10 µl drop contains approximately 1×1018 calcium atoms. The 41Ca/Ca ratios 

were  measured  using  RIMS  at  the  University  of  Mainz  and  using  ATTA  at  Argonne  National 

Laboratory.  For  each  ATTA  measurement  40  µl  of  the  solution  is  absorbed  and  dried  on  a 

titanium  sponge,  while  the  RIMS  measurement  uses  10  µl  of  solution  on  a  titanium  foil.  The 

titanium acts as an efficient reducing agent for the nitrate. 

In  order  to  measure  the  isotopic  abundance  of  41Ca,  the  ATTA  system  is  continuously 

switched between 2 minutes of trapping 41Ca and 10 seconds of trapping 42Ca for normalization. 

While  single  atom  detection  is  performed  to  count  41Ca,  the  42Ca  trap  typically  contains  103 

 

5

atoms,  whose  fluorescence  has  to  be  reduced  by  a  filter  before  being  measured  with  the  same 

photon counter. At the end of a measurement, which typically lasts for three hours, the counts for 

each isotope are summed up and a ratio of counts between the two isotopes is derived. Note that 

for  precise  isotope  ratio  measurements,  the  system  has  to  first  be  calibrated  with  samples  of 

known  ratios,  which  in  this  case  are  the  RIMS  values.  Three  samples  (Z1,  Z2  and  Z3)  were 

measured using both ATTA and RIMS (Fig. 4). A fourth sample of non-enriched calcium nitrate 

solution was used in a null measurement using ATTA. The measured isotope ratios are converted 

to 41Ca/Catotal by using the known isotope ratios of stable reference Ca isotopes. The errors on the 

ATTA  measurements  are  dominated  by  a  ~10%  statistical  error  on  the  41Ca  counts.  The  linear 

correlation between the ATTA and RIMS values shown in Fig. 4 not only serves as a calibration 

of ATTA, but also demonstrates the validity of ATTA as a quantitative analysis tool. From the 

absence  of  counts  during  the  null  sample  measurement,  we  conclude  that  within  one  hour  of 

observation the 3-σ detection limit on 41Ca/Ca reaches 4.5×10-10. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  a  new  method  of  analyzing  41Ca/Ca  ratios  in 

biomedical  samples.  Significant  improvements  to  the  ATTA  system  are  required  in  order  to 

determine much lower isotope abundances, e.g. for dating bones at the natural abundance level. 

The use of metallic calcium will allow the oven to hold a larger sample, and enable the system to 

achieve  a  higher  loading  rate  as  well  as  a  higher  trap  efficiency.  Additional  increase  can  be 

realized  by  implementing  a  full  two-dimensional  transverse  cooling.  In  order  to  reduce  the 

background  due  to  atomic  beam  fluorescence  the  trap  lifetime  would  need  to  be  increased  to 

enable temporal separation of trap loading and detection, in a similar way as has been used for 

81Kr analyses using ATTA [14]. Preliminary tests indicate that this increase in trap lifetime can 

be  achieved  by  repumping  the  intermediate  4s3d  1D2  level  with  a  diode  laser  at  672  nm 

wavelength.

We  propose  a  new  particle  acceleration  mechanism.  Electron  can  be  accelerated  to  relativistic 
energy  within  a  few  electromagnetic  wave  cycles  through  the  mechanism  which  is  named 
electromagnetic  and  magnetic  field  resonance  acceleration  (EMRA).  We  find  that  the  electron 
acceleration  depends  not  only  on  the  electromagnetic  wave  intensity,  but  also  on  the  ratio  between 
electron  Larmor  frequency  and electromagnetic  wave  frequency.  As  the  ratio approaches  to  unity,  a 
clear resonance peak is observed, corresponding to the EMRA. Near the resonance regime, the strong 
magnetic fields still affect the electron acceleration dramatically. We derive an approximate analytical 
solution  of the relativistic electron  energy  in  adiabatic  limit,  which  provides a  full  understanding  of 
this phenomenon. In typical parameters of pulsar magnetospheres, the mechanism allows particles to 
increase  their  energies  through  the  resonance  of  high  magnetic  field  and  high  frequency 
electromagnetic  wave  in  each  electromagnetic  wave  period.  The  energy  spectra  of  the  accelerated 
particles  exhibit  the  synchrotron  radiation  behavior.  These  can  help  to  understand  the  remaining 
emission  of  high  energy  electron  from  radio  pulsar  within  supernova  remnant.  The  other  potential 
application of our theory in fast ignition scheme of inertial confinement fusion is also discussed.

I．INTRODUCTION 

In the past two decades strong magnetic field caused much interesting both in astrophysics[1] and in 
laser-matter interaction[2], e.g. many novel and complex physics involved in ultraintense laser-plasma 
interaction  studies  especially  in  inertial  confinement  fusion  (ICF),  including  relativistic  self-
focusing[3],  explosive  channel  formation[4]  and  self-generated  huge  magnetic  field[5].  A  typical 
problem is to investigate the response of electron in the presence of strong quasistatic magnetic fields. 
Experiments[6,7] and three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations[8] clearly demonstrate 
that  the  fact  of  strong  currents  of  energetic 10 100−
MeV electrons  manifest  themselves  in  a  giant 
quasistatic  magnetic field with  up  to100 MG  amplitude.  Recently  the  laboratory  astrophysics  has a

physical  parameters  of  laser-plasma  interaction  experiments,  we  discover  a  quick  and  efficient 
electron  acceleration  related  with  intense  electromagnetic  wave  and  strong  magnetic  fields.  If  the 
similar parameters can be satisfied in pulsar environments, the efficient acceleration mechanism can 
help to understand the continue emission of electron from radio pulsars within supernova remnants.

The  radio  emission  mechanism  for  pulsars  is  not  adequately  understood.  Form  Ruderman  et  al. 
"inner-gap model"[9], B. zhang, et al.[10,11], G.J.Qiao et al.[12] the curvature radiation (CR) mode 
and  the  inverse  Compton  scattering  (ICS)  mode  (including  resonant  ICP  gap  mode  and  the  thermal 
ICS gap mode), the low-frequency and high-frequency electromagnetic waves can be predicted. These 
theories mentioned the pulsars polar gaps, sparks, and coherent microwave radiation also. Whatever 
the details of the emission mechanism, the properties of the low-frequency and high-frequency waves 
in relativistic pair plasma in the pulsar magnetosphere are of central importance for understanding the 
underlying  processes  in  the  formation  of  the  radio  spectrum.  In  this  paper  we  concentrate  on  high-
frequency electromagnetic wave case.

From above, we restrict our attention to a typical problem which is to investigate the response of 
electron in ultraintense electromagnetic wave plasma system in the presence of strong magnetic field. 
Using  test  particle  model,  we  solve  relativistic  Lorentz  force  equations  theoretically  and 
experimentally.  In  our  simulation,  the  electromagnetic  wave  is  a  circular  polarized  (CP)  Gaussian 
profile. The magnetic field is considered as an axial constant field. A fully relativistic single particle 
code is developed to investigate the dynamical properties of the energetic electrons. We find that a rest 
electron can be accelerated to relativistic energy within a few electromagnetic wave cycle through a 
mechanism which is named electromagnetic and magnetic field resonance acceleration (EMRA). The 
electron  acceleration  depends  not  only  on  the  electromagnetic  wave  intensity,  but  also  on  the  ratio 
between electron Larmor frequency and electromagnetic wave frequency. As the ratio approaches to 
unity, a clear resonance peak is observed, corresponding to the EMRA. Near the resonance regime, the 
strong  magnetic  field  still  affects  the  electron  acceleration  dramatically.  We  derive  an  approximate 
analytical  solution  of  the  relativistic  electron  energy  in  adiabatic  limit,  which  provides  a  full 
understanding of this phenomenon. Our paper is organized as follows. In Sec.II we discuss the plasma 
parameter  used  throughout  the  paper.  In  Sec.III  we  derive  the  dynamical  equation  describing 
relativistic electron in  combined strong  axial  magnetic  field  and the  CP  electromagnetic  wave  field. 
The equation will be solved both numerically and analytically. We describe EMRA in a Gaussian CP 
beam  with  static  axial  magnetic  field.  An  approximately  analytical  solution  of  relativistic  electron 
energy  is  obtained,  which  gives  a  good  explanation  for  our  numerical  simulation.  In  Sec.  IV  we 
consider  the  energy  spectra  of  the  accelerated  particles,  and  the  "Synchrotron  radiation"  will  be 
exhibited. We summarize the results and discuss the potential applications of pulsar radio emission in 
Sec. V. 
 

II．PLASMA PARAMETERS 

We  choose  what  we consider to  be  the  most  plausible  parameters.  From  the  location  of  the radio 
emission,  we  are  interested  in  the  high-frequency  electromagnetic  wave  range   
.  The 
characteristics of pulsar circular polarization summarized by Han et al.[13] should be considered by 
all  emission  models. The polarization  characteristics of the  mean  pulse  profile provide  a framework 
for  understanding  the  emission  processes  in  pulsars.  The  plasma  rest  frame  density  near  the  pulsar

Using  Eqs.(4)-(7),  we  choose  different  initial  position  to  investigate  the  electron  dynamics  for  a 
Gaussian profile electromagnetic wave pulse. Because the initial velocity can be transformed to initial 
position in our single test electron case, we keep initial velocity at rest and change the initial positions

Obtaining  an  exactly  analytical  solution  of  Eqs.(4)-(7)  is  impossible  because  of  their  nonlinearity. 
However,  we  notice  that  the  second  term  on  the  left  side  of  Eqs.(4)-(5)  possesses  symmetric  form, 
which  is  found  to  be  a  small  quantity  negligibly  after  careful  evaluation.  Then,  an  approximately 
analytical solutions of Eqs.(4)-(7) in adiabatic limit can be obtained.

From  the  above  analytic  solution  and  our  numerical  calculation,  we  find  that  the  strong  magnetic 
field  affect  the  electron  acceleration  dramatically  through  the  electromagnetic  and  magnetic  field 
resonance  acceleration  (EMRA).  The  electron  acceleration  depends  not  only  on  the  electromagnetic 
wave  intensity,  but  also  on  the  ratio  between  electron  Larmor  frequency  and  electromagnetic  wave 
frequency. The similar process can be happened in laser-plasma interaction system[15].

It  indicates  that  the  resonance  between  the  electromagnetic  wave  and  magnetic  field  will  drive  the 
energy  of  electrons  to  infinity  with  a  2 / 3  power  law  in  time.  In  typical  perimeter  of  pulsar 
magnetospheres, the mechanism provide chance to allow particles to increase their energies through

The calculations  made  in Sec.III  are  essential  for  the  study  of  radiation  emitted  by  the  accelerated 
electron.  The  starting  point  for  calculating  the  frequency  distribution  of  the  radiation  is  the  radiant 
energy emitted per unit frequency interval  dω. The radiation from moving electrons can be analyzed 
in  terms  of  the  well-known  Liénard-Wiechert  potentials[16].  In  the  far-field  approximation,  the

It is interesting to note that the synchrotron radiation has special characteristics not related with the 
electron  acceleration  mechanism.  It  produces  a  highly  collimated,  polarized,  continuous  spectrum, 
which includes wavelengths not available from other sources. This proved a key to some major current 
mysteries of the universe.

V．DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
We  have  derived  relativistic  energy  equation for a  single  electron  in the  presence  of  the  combined 
effect  of  magnetic  field  and  electromagnetic  wave  and  show  its  radiation  spectrum,  without  any 
restrictions  on  the  strength  of  the  magnetic  field,  the  intensity  of  the  electromagnetic  wave,  or  the 
initial direction of motion of the electron. The parameters can available in high energy density (HED) 
laser facilities which are the important aspect of the ICF-Astrophysics interaction. Using a single test 
electron model, we investigate the acceleration mechanism of energetic electrons in combined strong 
axial magnetic field and circular polarized electromagnetic wave field. An analytic solution of electron 
energy  is  obtained.  We  find  that  the  electron  acceleration  depends  not  only  on  the  electromagnetic 
wave intensity, known as the pondermotive acceleration, but also on the ratio between electron Larmor 
frequency  and  the  electromagnetic  wave  frequency.  As  the  ratio  equals  to  unity,  a  clear  resonance 
peak is observed, that is the electromagnetic and magnetic field resonance acceleration (EMRA). The 
strong magnetic field affects electron acceleration dramatically. This work can help to understand the 
continued emission of high energy electron from radio pulsars within supernova remnants. 

The  synchrotron  radiation  is  being  used  more  and  more  as  a  tool  in  a  number  of  disciplines 
including  spectroscopy,  photochemistry,  material  studies  and  biology.  The  discovery  of  a  pulsar 
within  the  Crab  Nebula,  generally  thought  to  be the remnant  of  a  historical  supernova  in  1054  AD, 
qualitatively  solved  the  mystery  of  why  continuum  optical  radiation  from  that  nebula  is  highly 
polarized and what powers it. Evidently a magnetized plasma flows from the pulsar. We can conceive 
that  the  central  part  of  the  Crab  nebula  is  still  emitting  high  speed  particles  related  with  the  pulsar 
radiation  process.  When  electrons  pass  through  matter,  they  suffer  magnetic  fields,  they  emit 
electromagnetic radiation. We must conclude that a charge moving at constant velocity cannot radiate 
energy.  The  electron  moves  in  circular  orbits  suffer  magnetic  fields  in  betatron  and  synchrotron 
emissions. As a radiation source, EMRA provides a wide range and high value of research done with 
synchrotron radiation.

signifies an Einstein constant dominated cosmology and a role 
for Extra dimensions in initial nucleation of a new universe 

A.  W. Beckwith  

ABSTRACT  

We use as a model of how nucleation of a new universe occurs, assuming a di 

quark  identification  for  S-S’  constituent  parts  of  a  scalar  field.  We  construct  a 

model  showing  evolution  from  a  dark matter  dark energy  mix  to  a  pure 

cosmological  constant  cosmology  due  to  changes  in  the  slope  of  a  graph  of  the 

resulting  scalar  field.  The  initial  potential  system  employed  is  semi  classical  in 

nature,  becoming  non-classical  at  the  end  of  chaotic  inflation  at  the  same  time 

cosmological expansion is dominated by the Einstein cosmological constant. We 

use  Scherrer’s  derivation  of  a  sound  speed  being  zero  during  initial  inflationary 

cosmology  —  and  change  it  afterwards  as  the  slope  of  the  scalar  field  moves 

away from a thin wall approximation. Furthermore, the results in Bo Qin’s article 

about  extra  dimensions  from  dark matter,  permit  us  to  show  the  impact  of 

dimensionality upon the role of semi classical approximations to inflation models 

.We  conclude  that  the  new  force  law  specified  by  Bo  Qin  and  additional 

dimensions would play a role in the early universe and be extremely important to 

the onset of inflationary expansion due to nucleation of di quark pairs in a S-S’ 

configuration.

I. 

INTRODUCTION  

Recently, Quin, Pen, and Silk1 presented evidence as to how three extra dimensions 

play  a  role  in  explaining  how  at  very  short  distances  gravity  would  have  a 

5−r

  spatial 

behavior  dependence  in  force  calculations.  The  emphasis  given  was  with  regards  to 

general dark matter masses, giving them a specific upper bound. The new variant of force 

law was relevant for scales at or below 

nm1

 in length. We find that this new force law 

and the additional dimensions would play a role in early universe nucleation models. This 

leads to very semi classical behavior at the onset of nucleation, and perhaps pertinent to 

the loss, initially, of a strict thin wall approximation to the domain walls for initial states 

of  matter  at  the  onset  of  inflationary  cosmology.  The  initial  additional  dimensions,

n

, 

were specified as leading to a force for small distance scales below a crucial radius of 

R  

leading to force with a spatial variance of 

r

 , which we believe plays a crucial role in 

−−2

n

early universe nucleation models. Arguments they presented1,2 so happened to fix this the 

value of 

n

 as 3, which is enough to specify for very small dimensional settings a highly 

repulsive  initial  starting  point  for  cosmological  inflation,  especially  if  the  value  of 

R >>

Pl

, with the initial radius of a nucleating universe being of the order of magnitude 

of 

Pl

 at or before a Planck time 

Pt

 . 

Our model shows that a semi-classical phase-state formed from initial di quark pairs 

in  a  region  of  the  order  of  magnitude  of  Planck’s  constant  for  length 

  changes  to  a 

Pl

physical  system  whose  evolution  is  dominated  by  the  Einstein  cosmological  constant. 

The initial phase state, which we approximate by a thin wall approximation, is similar to 

2 

 
 
 
the semi-classical bounce state that Sidney Coleman3 postulated; however, it changes in 

time  to  a  very  different  system  at  the  end  of  cosmological  inflation.  The  model 

advantages  are  first  that  we  provide  a  template  for  employing  baryonic  states  to  form 

dark matter as a driving force for the formation and expansion of cosmological states to 

the  present  conditions  of  our  present  universe.  We  also  give  initial  conditions  for  the 

formation of CMB, which are not readily explained by current models. In addition, this 

model  ties  in  with  being  able  to  use  the  Veneziano  model  of  strength  of  all 

forces,4gravitational and gauge alike. Veneziano’s model is one of the simplest ways to 

use  Planck’s  length 

  for  an  initial  starting  point  for  cosmological  nucleation  and 

Pl

expansion  from  the  formation  of  di  quark  pairs  with  a  very  high  number  of  degrees  of 

freedom in a confined state. 

II. BRIEF RE CAP OF QINS EXTRA DIMENSIONS FROM DARK 
MATTER ARTICLE 

As mentioned, Quinn’s article1 gives a new force law, with respect to distances at or 

below 

nm1

 in length. As presented in the article, this appears to be a verification of the 

existence of small but non infinitesimal extra dimensions. The key assumption which was 

used in their paper was a force law of the general form for distances

 This all together, if one assumes that initially  r  is 

of the order of magnitude of Planck’s length  would lead to extremely strong pressure 

Pl

values  upon  the  domain  walls  of  a  nucleated  scalar  field  initial  states,  which  I  claim 

would lead to a quite necessary collapse of the thin wall approximation. This collapse of 

the  thin  wall  approximation  set  the  stage  for  an  Einstein  constant  dominated  regime  in 

inflation, if one adheres to a version of Scherrer’s K essence theory

the di quark pairs used as an initial starting point for soliton-anti soliton pairs(S-S’) in the 

beginning of quantum nucleation of our universe. 

III. HOW TO ANALYZE PHYSICAL STATES IN THE 
PRECURSORS TO INFLATIONARY COSMOLOGY 

Let  us  first  consider  an  elementary  definition  of  what  constitutes  a  semi  classical 

state.  As  visualized  by  Buniy  and  Hsu,6  it  is  of  the  form a   which  has  the  following 

properties: 

i) Assume 

=aa

1

1

 

(Where 1 is an assumed identity operator, such that 1 a = a ) 

ii)  We  assume  that  a   is  a  state  whose  probability  distribution  is  peaked  about  a 

central value, in a particular basis, defined by an operator  Z  

a) Our assumption above will naturally lead, for some n values 

n

(

)  

Furthermore, this will lead to, if an operator  Z  obeys Eq. (2) that if there exists another 

operator, call it Y which does not obey Eq. (2), that usually we have non commutativity

Buniy and Hsu6 speculate that we can, in certain cases, approximate a semi classical 

evolution equation of state for physical evolution of cosmological states with respect to 

classical  physics  operators.  This  well  may  be  possible  for  post  inflationary  cosmology; 

however, in the initial phases of quantum nucleation of a universe, it does not apply. 

To review our model of S-S’ pair nucleosynthesis for di quark pair states in an early 

universe, first is the issue of how the potential evolved. Namely:

Please see the conclusion for misgivings I have about this very simplified model in 

Eq. (7).  Eq. (7)  would  likely  be  redone  substantially  in  a  future  calculation  with  brane 

world  type  of  topological  defects.  Assuming  that  this  is  a  valid  initial  dimensional 

approximation, we did the following for the three potentials. 

a.  Assumed  that  the  scalar  wave  functional  term  was  decreasing  in  ‘height’  and 

increasing in ‘width’ as we moved from the first to the third potentials.φ also had 

a  definite  evolution  of  the  domain  wall  from  a  ‘near  perfect’  thin  wall 

approximation to one which had a considerable slope existing with respect to the 

wall.  

6 

 
 
 

 

b.  We also observed that in doing this sort of model that there was a diminishing of 

applicability  of  Eq. (7)  for  large  N  values,  regardless  if  or  not  the  thin  wall 

approximation  was  weakened  as  we  went  from  the  first  to  the  third  potential 

system.  In  doing  to,  we  also  noted  that  even  in  Eq. (7)  for  the  first  potential, 

where  Eq. (7)  was  almost  identically  the  same  values  on  both  sides  of  the 

inequality, that Eq. (7) had diminishing applicability as a result for decreasing b 

values in Eq. (5),  which corresponded to when the thin wall approximation was 

least adhered to.  

We also observed that for the third potential, that there was never an overlap in value 

between  the  left  and  right  hand  sides  of  Eq. (7),  regardless  of  whether  the  thin  wall 

approximation was adhered to. In other words, the third potential was least linkable to a 

semi  classical  approximation  of  physical  behavior  linkable  to  a  physical  system,  while 

Eq. (7)  worked  best  for  a  thin  domain  wall  approximation  to  Eq. (5)  in  the  driven  sine 

Gordon  approximation  of  a  potential  system.  In  all  this,  we  assumed  that  the  small 

perturbing term added to the  (
1

)

cos(
)
φ−

 part of Eq. (7) was a physical driving term to a 

very classical potential system  (
1

))
cos(
φ−

 which had a quantum origin consistent with 

the interpretation of a false vacuum nucleation of the sort initially formulated by Sidney 

Coleman.1 Furthermore, as we observed an expanding ‘width’ in Eq. (5), the alpha term 

in  Eq. (6)  shrank  in  its  value,  corresponding  to  a  change  in  the  position  of  constituent 

S-S’  components  in  the  scalar  field  given  in  this  model.  The  S-S’  terms  roughly 

corresponded to di quark pairs.  

c.  Chaotic  inflation  in  cosmology  is,  in  the  sense  a  quartic  potential  portrayed  by 
Guth,7 a general term for models of the very early Universe which involve a short 

period  of  extremely  rapid  (exponential)  expansion;  blowing  the  size  of  what  is 

now the observable Universe up from a region far smaller than a proton to about 

the  size  of  a  grapefruit  (or  even  bigger)  in  a  small  fraction  of  a  second.  This

and 

 

process smoothes out space-time to make the Universe flat, but is not in the model 

presented linkable in the chaotic inflationary region given by the third potential to 

any semi classical arguments. The relative good fit of Eq. (7) for the first potential 

is  in  itself  an  argument  that  the  thin  wall  approximation  breaks  down  past  the 

point of baryogenesis after the chaotic inflationary regime is initiated by the third 
potential as modeled by Guth.7

To summarize the numerical procedures in the set of simulations for Eq. (7), they are:

This assumes that the second term in the first potential, Eq (3a), is 1/100 of the first 

term. Were we to have a smaller b term, the relative overlap of Eq. (6a1) and Eq. (7a2) 

would go down, and it goes up with increasing b values.

As with the first potential, the relative divergence of the left and right hand sides of 

Eq. (7)  go  up  if  b  gets  smaller  and  decrease  if  b  gets  larger.  Still,  this  has  a  far  less 

rigorous fit between the left and sides of Eq. (7) fit together than what happens with the 

first potential situation. 

And,  then,  finally  we  have  the  chaotic  inflationary  potential  given  by  Guth,4  which 

shows  no  overlap  at  all  in  either  side  of  Eq. (7).  For  the  thrid  potential,  Eq. (3c),

These  results  hold,  even  if  b  is  increased  in  value.  Namely,  the  overlap  vanishes 

Appendix  I  offers  even  more  striking  results.  Namely  that  if  one  uses  a  higher  6 

dimensional  ‘volume’  element  for  initial  nucleated  space,  that  the  agreement  of  Eq. (7) 

for a spatial six dimensional analysis as a starting point for the first potential will lead to 

an almost exact equality. Furthermore, if we use a normalization procedure as outlined in 

that appendix, and compare the ratios of both sides, that the relative slope of the scalar 

9 

 
 
 
field will not be terribly important, in determining the relative contributions to both sides 

of  Eq. (7)  for  2nd  and  3rd  potentials.  Still  though  we  argue  that  for  especially  the  1st 

potential  that  the  higher  dimensionality  enhances  the  likelihood  of  a  semi  classical 

analysis being a good starting point, even though it appears to have only weak links to the 

chaotic inflationary 3rd potential as given in this analysis. 

The comparison of the evolution of these different cases for Eq. (7) argue that if we 

show that in between the physical states represented from the first to the third potentials 

there is a phase change which has measurable consequences for cosmological evolution. 

Furthermore,  we  can  employ  a  different  paradigm  as  to  how  topological  defects  (kinks 

and anti kinks) contribute to the onset of initial conditions at the beginning of inflationary 

cosmology. Currently, as seen by Mark Trodden9 and Trodden et al,10 topological defects 

are similar to D branes of string theory; while this S-S’ (soliton-antisoliton) construction 

permits  extensions  to  super-symmetric  theories,  it  obscures  direct  links  to  inflationary 

cosmological potentials such as Guth’s7 harmonic potential.  

The zeroth level assumption underlying this is that there could be a C-P violation in 

the initial phases of states of matter. This in turn leads to Baryon matter state separation 

into Baryon-anti Baryon pairs (di quark pairs) which in turn would lead to the S-S’ pair 

formation alluded to in Guth.7 If the di quark pairs form, we would have a situation where 

an overall topological charge Q would tend to then vanish for our physical system. 

To  make  the  linkage  clearer,  we  can  present  the  di  quark  S-S’  pairs  as  an  initial 

starting point for times 

t ≤

Pt

, where 

Pt

 is Planck’s discretized smallest unit of time as a 

coarse graining of time stepping in cosmological evolution. Initially, let us look at work 

by Zhitnitsky

11 about formation of a soliton object via a so called di quark condensate.  

 

10 

 
 
 

 

a)  A  C-P  violation  in  initial  states  would  lead  to  an  initial  Baryon  condensate  of 

matter separating into actual S-S’ di quark pairs: 

b)  for times less than or equal to Planck time 

 the potential system for analyzing 

Pt

the  nucleation  of  a  universe  is  a  driven  Sine  Gordon  system,

12  with  the  driving 

force in magnitude far less than the overall classical Sine Gordon potential.  

c)  for this potential system, topological charges for a S-S’ di quark pair stem prior to 

Planck  time 

  cancel  out,  leaving  a  potential  proportional  to 

2φ

  minus  a 

Pt

contribution  due  to  quantum  fluctuations  of  a  scalar  field  being  equal  in 

magnitude  to  a  classical  system,  with  the  remaining  scalar  potential  field 

contributing to cosmic inflation in the history of the early universe.  

The next assumption is that  a vacuum fluctuation of energy equivalent to 

Et
h=∆⋅∆

 

will lead to the nucleation of a new universe, provided that we are setting our initial time 

t P ∆≈
t

 as the smallest amount of time which can be ascertained  in a quantum universe.  

If a phase transition occurs right after our nucleation of an initial state, it is due to the 

time of nucleation actually being less than (or equal to) Planck’s minimum time interval 

Pt

 , with the length specified by reconciling the fate of the false vacuum potential used in 

nucleation  with  a  Bogomol’nyi  inequality  specifying  the  vanishing  of  topological 

charge

13. We can use S-S’ di quark pairs to represent an initial scalar field, which, after 

time 

t P ∆≈
t

,  will  descend  into  the  typical  chaotic  inflationary  potential  used  for 

inflationary cosmology.  

IV. INCLUDING IN NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS 
FOR FORMING A CONDENSATE STATE AT OR BEFORE 
PLANCK TIME 

  Pt

For  a  template  for  the  initial  expansion  of  a  scalar  field  leading  to  false  vacuum 

inflationary  dynamics  in  the  expansion  of  the  universe,  Zhitnitsky’s14  formulation  for 

11 

 
 
 
how to form a condensate of a stable soliton style configuration of cold dark matter is a 

useful  starting  point  for  how  an  axion  field  can  initiate  forming  a  so  called  QCD  ball. 

Zhitnitsky14 uses quarks in a non-hadronic state of matter that, in the beginning, can be in 

di  quark  pairs.  A  di  quark  pair  would  permit  making  equivalence  arguments  to  what  is 

done with cooper pairs and a probabilistic representation as to find the relative ‘size’ of 

the cooper pair. We assume an analogous operation can be done with respect to di quark 

pairs. In doing so, calculations14 for quarks being are squeezed by a so called QCD phase 

transition  due  to  the  violent  collapse  of  an  axion  domain  wall.  The  axion  domain  wall 

would  be  the  squeezer  to  obtain  a  so  called  S-S’  configuration.  This  presupposes  a 

formation of a highly stable soliton type configuration in the onset due to the growth in 

baryon mass  

M B ≈

This  is  due  to  a  large  baryon  (quark)  charge  B   which  Zhitnitsky14  finds  is  smaller 

than an equivalent mass of a collection of free separated nucleons with the same charge. 

This provides a criteria for absolute stability by writing a region of stability for the QCD 

balls dependent upon the inequality occurring for 

B >.

 (a critical charge value) 

CB

He14  furthermore  states  that  stability,  albeit  not  absolute  stability  is  still  guaranteed  for 

the formation of meta stable states occurring with  

If we make the assumptions that there is a balance between Fermi pressure

If we wish to have this of the order of magnitude of a Planck length 

, then the axion 

Pl

domain  wall  tension  must  be  huge,  which  is  not  unexpected.  Still  though,  this  pre 

supposes a minimum value of 

B  which Zhitnitsky14 set as

exp

10~CB

20

 

We need to keep in mind that Zhitnitsky14 set this parameterization up to account for 

a dark matter candidate. I am arguing that much of this same concept is useful for setting 

up  an  initial  condensate  of  di  quark  pairs  as,  separately  S-S’  in  the  initial  phases  of 

nucleation, with the further assumption that there is an analogy with the so called color 

super conducting phase (CS) which would permit di quark channels. The problem we are 

analyzing  not  only  is  equivalent  to  BCS  theory  electron  pairs  but  can  be  linked  to 

creating a region of nucleated space in the onset of inflation which has S-S’ pairs. The 

S-S’  pairs  would  have  a  distance  between  them  proportional  to  distance  mentioned 

earlier,

0R

, which would be greater than or equal to the minimum Planck’s distance value 

of

Pl

.  The  moment  one  would  expect  to  have  deviations  from  the  flat  space  geometry 

would  closely  coincide  with  Rocky  Kolb’s  model  for  when  degrees  of  freedom  would 

decrease from over 100 degrees of freedom to roughly ten or less during an abrupt QCD 

13 

 
 
 
phase transition. The QCD phase transition would be about the time one went from the 

first to the second potential systems mentioned above. 

V. HOW THIS TIES IN WITH REGARDS TO THE SCHERRER K 
ESSENCE MODEL RESULTS 

 We15 have investigated the role an initial false vacuum procedure with a driven sine 

Gordon potential plays in the nucleation of a scalar field in inflationary cosmology. Here, 

we  show  how  that  same  scalar  field  blends  naturally  into  the  chaotic  inflationary 

cosmology presented by Guth7 which has its origins in the evolution of nucleation of an 

electron-positron  pair  in  a  de  Sitter  cosmology.  The  final  results  of  this  model,  when 

+→ εφ

, appears congruent with the existence of a region that matches the flat slow roll 

requirement of

second derivatives of the potential w.r.t. scalar fields divided by the potential itself being 

very  small  quantities,  where  H    is  the  expansion  rate  that  is  a  requirement  of  realistic 

inflation models.7 This is due to having the potential in question

constant for declining scalar values. 

We  have  formed,  using  Scherrer’s  argument,6  a  template  for  evaluating  initial 

conditions  to  shed  light  on  whether  this  model  universe  is  radiation-dominated  in  the 

beginning or is more in sync with having its dynamics determined by assuming a straight 

cosmological  constant.  Our  surprising  answer  is  that  we  do  not  have  conditions  for  

formation  of  a  cosmological  constant-dominated  era  when  close  to  a  thin  wall 

approximation of a scalar field of a nucleating universe, but that this is primarily due to 

an  extremely  sharp  change  in  slope  of  the  would-be  potential  field  φ.  The  sharpness  of 

 

14 

 
 
 
this  slope,  leading  to  a  near  delta  function  behavior  for  kinematics  at  the  thin  wall 

approximation  for  the  initial  conditions  of  an  expanding  universe  would  lead,  at  a  later 

time,  to  conditions  appropriate  for  necessary  and  sufficient  cosmological  dynamics 

largely  controlled  by  a  cosmological  constant  when  the  scalar  field  itself  ceases  to  be 

affected by the thin wall approximation but is a general slowly declining slope.

indicating  that  the  evolution  of  the  magnitude  of  the  phase

  corresponds  with  a 

reduction  of  our  cosmology  from  a  dark energy dark matter  mix  to  the  more  standard 

cosmological  constant  models  used  in  astrophysics.  This  coincidently  is  when  the  semi 

classical evaluation involving S-S’ di quark pairs breaks down, as given by Eq. (7) and 

corresponds  to  the  b  of  Eq. (5)  for 

+→ εφ

being  quite  small.  It  also  denotes  a  region 

where  there  is  a  dramatic  reduction  of  the  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  FRW  space  time 

metric,  as  Kolb  postulated  so  that  we  can  then  visualize  cosmological  dynamics  being 

governed  by  the  Einstein  constant  at  the  conclusion  of  the  cosmological  inflationary 

period.

which  is  still  huge  for  an  initial  starting  point,  whereas  we  manage  to  in  our  S-S’ 

‘distance model’ to imply a far smaller but still non zero radii for the initial ‘universe’ in 

our model.  

We  find  that  the  above  formulation  in  Eq. (34)  is  most  easily  accompanied  by  the 

given  S-S’  di  quark  pair  basis  for  the  scalar  field  used  in  this  paper,  and  that  it  also  is 

consistent with the initial scalar cosmological state evolving toward the dynamics of the 

cosmological constant via the k essence argument built up near the end of this document. 

Furthermore, we also argue that the semi classical analysis of the initial potential system 

as given by Eq. (7) and its subsequent collapse is de facto evidence for a phase transition 

to conditions allowing for CMB to be created at the beginning of inflationary cosmology.  

 

 

 

21 

 
 
 

 

We are fortunate as shown in Appendix I that for determining the relative good fit of 

Eq. (7) that the relative domain walls slope of the initial phase given by Eq. (5) was not 

terribly  significant,  for  the  first  potential  system,  which  dove  tails  with  Eq. (1)  merely 

pushing  out  the  domain  walls,  as  a  primary  effect,  for  a  driven  sine  Gordon  type 

modeling of false vacuum nucleation. As ,mentioned earlier, this was actually heightened 

by the extra dimensionality as alluded to by the power law relationship in Eq. (1) making 

an  almost  perfect  equality  between  the  left  and  right  hand  sides  of  Eq. (7).  That  the 

different sides of Eq. (7) in Appendix I had varying values, showing different degrees of 

break  down  of  this  relationship  for  the  2nd    transitional  potential,  due  to  differences  in 

dimensionality  and  slope  of  the  scalar  field  as  given  by  Eq. (5)  is  probably  due  to  this 

representing  the  abrupt  loss  of  numbers  of  degrees  of  freedom  Rocky  Kolb  has 

mentioned as part of a phase transition. Needless to say though, as we evolve toward the 

Einstein cosmological constant era and chaotic inflation, as given by the 3rd potential, we 

should keep in mind very real limits as to the comparative sharpness of the slope of the 

scalar field as given by Eq. (5) 

K  essence  analysis  argues  against  making  b  in  Eq. (5)  too  large,  i.e.,  if  we  have  a 

‘perfect’ thin wall approximation to our S-S’ di quark pairs, we will have the unphysical 

speed  of  sound  results  plus  other  consequences  detailed  in  the  k  essence  section  of  the 

document which we do not want. On the other hand, the semi classical analysis brought 

up in the section starting with Eq. (7) shows us that a close to the thin wall approximation 

for S-S’ di quark pairs gives an optimal fit for consistency in the potential with the wave 

functions  exhibiting  a  thin  wall  approximation  ‘character’.  It  is  useful  to  note  that  our 

kinetic model can be compared with the very interesting Chimentos19 purely kinetic k –

22 

 
 
 
essence  model,  with  density  fluctuation  behavior  at  the  initial  start  of  a  nucleation 

process.  The  model  indicate  our  density  function  reach 

=ρ  constant  after  passing 

through the tunneling barrier  as mentioned in  our nucleation of  a S-S’ pair ensemble. 

This  is  when  the  Einstein  constant  becomes  dominant  and  that  the  semi  classical 

approximation  in  Eq.  (7)  for  a  domain  wall  at  the  time  the  comparative  thin  wall 

approximation S-S’ pair ceases to be relevant.  

Further  developments  of  this  idea  would  entail  more  concreted  modeling  of  initial 

wave  functional  states  than  the  admittedly  very  crude  start  given  by  Eq.  (6).  I  also  am 

convinced that the quantum fluctuation idea, as referenced by that 

∗φ

 term in Eq. (4a) is 

a trigger for entropy growth which would be a convenient start for the break down of the 

scalar  field  thin  wall  approximation  I  used  in  the  initial  phases  of  this  document.  This 

would not be materially different from utilizing 

TE
⋅=⋅δ

dS

 

(36) 

as a pre cursor to an energy fluctuation at the beginning of the nucleation process being in 

tandem  with  changes  in  entropy.  Note  that  both  Eq.  (6)  and  Eq.  (7)  were  done  in  the 

simplest manner possible. This very likely should be re visited, especially if the sort of 

brane  world  objects  referred  to  by  Trodden  et  al9,10  are  used  in  a  future  calculation  for 

initial nucleation states.

For the 2nd potential system, if we assume a sharp slope, i.e. b1 = b = 10, and 

We do specify a denominator, due to a normalization contribution we write as

When one has the thin wall approximation removed, via b1 = 1.5, one does not see a  

difference in the ratios obtained. 
 

For the 3rd potential system, which is intermediate between the 1st and 2nd potentials  

if the b1 = b = 10 value is used, one obtains for when we have six dimensions

Fig 1a,b:  Evolution  of  the  phase  from  a  thin  wall  approximation  to  a  more  nuanced 

thicker  wall  approximation  with  increasing  L  between  S-S’  instanton  components.  The 

‘height’ drops and the ‘width’ L increases correspond to a de evolution of the thin wall 

approximation.  This  is  in  tandem  with  a  collapse  of  an  initial  nucleating  ‘potential’ 

system to the standard chaotic scalar 

 potential system of Guth. As the ‘hill’ flattens, 

2φ

and  the  thin  wall  approximation  dissipates,  the  physical  system  approaches  standard 

cosmological constant behavior.  

Fig  2a,b:  As  the  walls  of  the  S-S’  pair  approach  the  thin  wall  approximation,  a 

normalized distance,

 L = 6 

L→

 = 3, approaches delta function behavior at the 

boundaries  of  the  new  nucleating  phase.  As  L  increases,  the  delta  function  behavior 

subsides  dramatically.  Here,  the

  conditions  approaching  a  cosmological 

constant.  L=  6  ⇔  conditions  reflecting  Scherrer’s  dark energy-dark matter  mix. 

L  = 3  ⇔   approaching  unphysical  delta  function  contributions  due  to  a  pure  thin  wall 

model.

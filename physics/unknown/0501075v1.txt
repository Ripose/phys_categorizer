We review the latest progress and properties of the families of bright and dark one-

dimensional  periodic  waves  propagating  in  saturable  Kerr-type  and  quadratic 

nonlinear  media.  We  show  how  saturation  of  the  nonlinear  response  results  in 

appearance of stability (instability) bands in focusing (defocusing) medium, which is 

in sharp contrast with the properties of periodic waves in Kerr media. One of the key 

results discovered is the stabilization of multicolor periodic waves in quadratic media. 

In particular, dark-type waves are shown to be metastable, while bright-type waves 

are completely stable in a broad range of energy flows and material parameters. This 

yields  the  first  known  example  of  completely  stable  periodic  wave  patterns 

propagating  in  conservative  uniform  media  supporting  bright  solitons.  Such  results 

open  the  way  to  the  experimental  observation  of  the  corresponding  self-sustained 

periodic wave patterns.

1. Introduction 

Periodic wave structures in general play a central role in the field of nonlinear 

waves  of  different  nature  [1-7].  They  are  at  the  core  of  the  development  of 

modulational  instabilities  and  optical  turbulence  in  continuous  nonlinear  media,  the 

eigenmodes  of  such  quasi-discrete  or  discrete  systems  as  waveguide  arrays  or 

mechanical, molecular and electrical chains. They are closely related to Bloch waves

in  solid-state  physics,  matrices  of  ultracold  atoms  or  trapped  Bose-Einstein 

condensates,  and  light-induced  reconfigurable  photonic  lattices.  Also  self-sustained 

periodic wave structures were studied in the context of Langmuir plasma waves [8,9], 

deep-water  gravity  waves 

[5,10],  pulse  trains  in  optical  fibers  [1-4,11-17], 

reconfigurable  beam  arrays  in  photorefractive  crystals  [7,18,19],  matter  waves  in 

trapped  Bose-Einstein  condensates  [20-24],  or  synchronously  pumped  optical 

parametric oscillators [25,26], to mention a few. By and large, the concept of periodic 

nonlinear  waves  allows  to  bridge  the  gap  between  localized  solitons  and  linear 

harmonic or continuous waves [1,2]. 

However,  periodic  wave  structures  propagating  in  single-pass  conservative 

media tend to suffer strong instabilities and thus quickly self-destroy. To date stable 

periodic  patterns  were  known  only  in  physical  settings  modeled  by  self-defocusing 

nonlinearities  [3,8-11,27-29],  in  systems  trapped  by  external  potentials,  like  Bose-

Einstein  condensates  in  periodical  traps  [20-22],  or  in  dissipative  confined  systems, 

like  optical  cavities.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  all  other  known  examples  of 

periodic waves in conservative uniform medium supporting bright solitons were found 

to  be  dynamically  unstable.  Actually,  the  stabilization  of  periodic  waves  goes  far 

beyond the properties of each individual structural element, because the stability of 

the periodic wave is a property of the structure as a whole. Therefore, elucidation of 

stable  periodic  waves  requires  the  identification  of  suitable  physical  settings  where 

such  stabilization  might  occur,  as  well  as  the  development  of  new  mathematical 

techniques to study the stability of periodic nonlinear waves. 

Here we review the properties of recently discovered completely linearly stable 

and metastable (i.e., weakly unstable, but surviving in the numerical simulations for 

distances  exceeding  the  feasible  crystal  lengths  in  the  presence  of  input  noise 

superimposed on the exact stationary solutions) periodic waves in Kerr-type saturable 

and  quadratic  nonlinear  media,  supporting  bright  and  dark  localized  solitons.  We 

reveal that in both cases, stabilization of bright periodic waves occurs above certain 

threshold power level. We also show that, in contrast to the results known for pure 

Kerr  nonlinear  media,  dark  periodic  waves  can  be  destabilized  by  saturation  of 

nonlinear  response,  while  dark  quadratic  waves  turn  out  to  be  metastable  in  the 

broad  range  of  material  parameters.  Linear  stability  analysis  of  periodic  waves  was 

revealed  by  a  specific  new  mathematical  formalism,  based  on  a  Floquet  approach, 

and  was  confirmed  by  direct  numerical  simulations  of  propagation  of  the  periodic 

waves perturbed with white input noise.

Propagation  of  optical  radiation  in  (1+1)  dimensions  in  saturable  Kerr-type

For  example,  photorefractive  crystals  admit  relatively  high  nonlinearity  of 

saturable  character  already  at  intensities  typical  for  continuous  wave  helium-neon 

lasers,  and  what  is  important  the  saturation  level  could  be  controlled  by  biasing 

background  illumination  [30-34].  Notice  that  in  photorefractive  crystals  the  sign  of 

nonlinearity  depends  on  polarity  of  applied  static  electric  field.  For  typical

is  an  important  characteristic  of  the  solution  that  defines  localization  of  the  energy 

inside each wave period. 

The  basic  properties  of  periodic  solutions  of  Eq.  (2)  are  summarized  in  Figs. 

1(a),(b)  for  dark  sn-type  wave  (

σ = +

1)

;  Figs.  2(a),(b)  for  bright  cn-type  wave 

(σ = −

1)

; and in Figs. 3(a),(b) for bright dn-type waves  (

σ = −

1)

. Sn- and cn-type 

waves  periodically  change  their  sign  (Figs.  1(b),  2(b)),  whereas  dn-wave  is  always 

positive and contains a constant pedestal (Fig. 3(b)). Though exact solutions of Eq. 

(2)  are  described  by  Jacoby  elliptic  functions  of  sn,  cn,  and  dn  types  only  in  the 

limiting case S

0→

 [27-29], here we by analogy keep these notations since saturation 

of nonlinear response does not change the topology of the solutions [35]. 

The dispersion diagrams (energy flow versus the propagation constant) of sign-

altering  sn-  and  cn-waves  are  quite  similar  (see  Figs.  1(a),  2(a)).  In  the  low-energy 

limit 

U →

0

  as  well  as  in  the  high-energy  limit  U

→ ∞

  both  sn-  and  cn-waves 

transform  into  harmonic  patterns.  The  corresponding  low-  and  high-energy  cut-offs 

are  given  by  b

  and  b

S

.  The  domain  of  existence  of 

dn-type wave is narrowed with growth of saturation parameter (Fig. 3(a)), and near 

cut-offs  dn-wave  is  close  to  plane  one.  For  strong  localization  (especially  for  small 

values of  S ) at intermediate energies cn-waves transform into arrays of out-of-phase 

bright  solitons,  dn-wave  into  arrays  of  in-phase  bright  solitons,  and  sn-wave  into 

arrays  of  out-of-phase  kinks,  or  dark  solitons.  The  integral  width  reaches  its 

maximum  value  for  sn-waves  and  its  minimum  value  for  cn-waves  at  intermediate

energy  levels  that  corresponds  to  the  narrowest  dark  holes  and  bright  peaks  for  sn- 

and cn-waves, respectively. 

To  perform  the  linear  stability  analysis  of  periodic  waves  in  the  saturable 

medium  we  use  the  new  mathematical  formalism,  initially  developed  for  periodic 

waves in cubic nonlinear media [27-29]. We search for perturbed solution of Eq. (1) in 

the form:

solvers  since  only

4×

  matrices  are  required  for  the  construction  of  the  areas  of 

existence of finite perturbations. 

We  have  considered  perturbations  of  sn-,  cn-  and  dn-waves  with  general 

complex  growth  rates  and  explored  a  broad  interval  of  saturation  parameters 

0

S≤ ≤

10

. The whole complex  δ -plane was covered with the fine grid (typically the 

step  in  the  modulus  of  δ   was  0.001  and  the  step  in  the  phase  was 

π

/1000

)  and 

thoroughly  scanned.  For  periodic  wave  patterns  the  areas  of  existence  of  finite 

perturbations have a band structure. If wave is stable condition 

λ =
1,2

1

 is fulfilled 

only for imaginary  δ . 

In contrast to the case of defocusing cubic medium, where sn-waves are stable 

in  the  entire  domain  of  their  existence,  we  have  found  that  in  saturable  media  sn-

waves become weakly unstable when their energy flow exceeds a certain critical value 

(i.e., when b

≥

crb

). This instability corresponds to complex growth rates and, hence, 

is of the oscillatory type. The maximum real part of the complex growth rate versus 

propagation  constant  is  shown  in  Fig.  1(c)  for  various  values  of  the  saturation 

parameter. Notice that the oscillatory instability of the sn-waves occurs in the narrow 

band  of  propagation  constants  near  the  high-energy  cut-off.  Areas  of  existence  of 

stable and unstable sn-waves are shown in Fig. 1(d). 

Cn-waves  in  cubic  media  suffer  from  oscillatory  instabilities  in  their  entire 

domain of existence. In contrast, the central result of the present section is that cn-

waves  in  focusing  saturable  media  become  linearly  stable  when  their  energy  flow 

exceeds a certain critical level (Figs. 2(c) and 2(d)). This is consistent with the strong 

stabilizing action of saturation of nonlinear response on propagation of self-sustained 

nonlinear  waves,  dramatically  illustrated  by  the  stabilization  of  bell-shaped  bright 

soliton in bulk media. The oscillatory-type instability of cn-waves in saturable media 

occurs  for  the  band  of  propagation  constants  near  the  low-energy  cut-off,  i.e.  for 

−

1/ 2

≤ ≤
b

b

.  The  maximal  real  part  of  complex  growth  rate  versus  propagation 

cr

constant is shown in Fig. 2(c). Notice that real parts of growth rates quickly decrease 

with growth of saturation parameter. This means that even periodic waves from the 

unstable  region  can  potentially  be  observed  at  high  saturation  levels  because  their 

typical decay length would exceed any experimentally feasible crystal length. Notice 

 

6

that the width of the stability band for cn-waves increases with decrease of saturation 

parameter. In the limit  S

0→

 results are in full agreement with those for unstable 

cn-waves in cubic media. 

Dn-type waves were found to suffer from exponentially growing instabilities in 

the  entire  domain  of  their  existence  –  the  result  that  is  typical  for  the  waves  with 

pedestal. Areas for finite perturbations with real growth rates are shown in Fig. 3(c). 

It is interesting that the structural instability of dn-wave typically manifests itself in 

fusion  of  neighboring  peaks  (Fig.  3(d)),  just  as  in  the  case  of  interaction  of  two  in-

phase solitons [36]. 

To  confirm  the  results  of  the  linear  stability  analysis  and  to  elucidate  its 

actual  impact  in  the  long-term  evolution  of  the  periodic  waves,  we  have  also 

integrated  Eq.  (1)  using  the  beam  propagation  method  with  input  conditions

Gaussian  envelope  imposed  on  the  infinite  periodic  pattern.  The  width  of  the 

envelope was much larger than the wave period. The results of simulations are in full 

agreement  with  results  of  linear  stability  analysis.  For  example,  Figs.  4(a)-4(d) 

illustrate the stable propagation of perturbed snoidal and cnoidal waves. The periodic 

waves  maintain  their  input  structure  over  several  thousand  units  that  exceed  any 

feasible  crystal  length  by  several  orders  of  magnitude.  For  instance  in  typical 

photorefractive  crystals  propagation  up  to  1000  units  shown  in  Figs.  4(a)-4(d) 

corresponds to actual physical distance about 2 meters. In some simulations we used 

quite  big  noise  variance  (up  to 

=

0.06

)  to  address  the  stability  of  strongly 

σ

perturbed periodic patterns of sn- and cn-types, and found that they can survive even 

in this case. 

3. Periodic waves in quadratic nonlinear media 

In  this  section  we  consider  the  case  of  light  pulse  (beam)  propagation  in  a 

quadratic nonlinear crystal where a fundamental frequency wave (FF) and its second 

harmonic  (SH)  interact  with  each  other  near  phase-matching.  The  evolution  of  the 

corresponding slowly varying envelopes under conditions for non-critical type I phase 

matching is described by the system of coupled equations [37-40]:

mismatch. We assume that there is no walk-off between FF and SH waves, as in non-

critical phase-matching.

. Notice 

that  particular  examples  of  periodic  wave  solutions  of  Eqs.  (8)  can  be  obtained 

analytically  with  the  aid  of  Hamiltonian  formalisms,  direct  substitution,  and  Lie 

group  techniques  [41-43].  However,  whole  families  of  solutions  should  be  obtained 

numerically  [44-46].  In  the  large  phase-mismatch  limit 

β (cid:21)   Eqs.  (8)  can  be 

1

converted  into  single  cubic  Schrodinger  equation  for  the  FF  wave  having  three 

different types of solutions in the form of sn-, cn-, and dn-type waves. Therefore the 

general solutions of Eqs. (8) at moderate mismatches can be classified in accordance 

with their asymptotical sn-, cn-, or dn-type shape in the large mismatch limit. 

 

Continuous families of bright and dark soliton solutions of Eqs. (8) correspond 

to  two  qualitatively  different  situations.  For  d d
1 2

0<

  (this  is  possible  for  temporal 

solitons only) Eqs. (8) admit of continuous families of dark soliton solutions, whereas 

situation

  (this  can  be  achieved  for  both  spatial  and  temporal  solitons) 

corresponds to bright soliton families.

which  is  directly  related  to  the  amplitude  of  the  constant  background  in  SH  wave 

profile, and, hence, to the potential stability/instability of dark waves. The closer the 

contrast to one, the smaller is the amplitude of the constant background. Notice that 

the FF wave does not contain constant background and thus C

flow). Notice that the higher is the phase mismatch the higher is the contrast. In a

For  sn-type  waves  at

  this  width  slowly  increases  with  the  increase  of  the

particular case, at negative phase mismatch. At low energy levels and negative phase 

mismatches the main part of the energy is concentrated in the SH wave, whereas at 

high  energies  S   is  higher  than  S .  In  the  case  of  positive  mismatch  the  FF  wave

always  contains  the  largest  part  of  the  total  energy.  The  typical  profile  of  the  dark 

snoidal  periodic  wave  is  depicted  in  Fig.  5(d).  Notice  that  sn-type  waves  constitute 

the periodic analogs of the bound states of a few dark solitons studied in Refs. [47,48].

Stability  analysis  revealed  that  at  β

1≤ −

  sn-type  waves  are  exponentially 

unstable  in  the  whole  domain  of  their  existence,  whereas  for 

β

1≥ −

  exponential 

instabilities were found inside certain band of propagation constants (Fig. 6(a)). The 

areas  of  existence  of  finite  perturbations  at  negative  and  positive  phase  mismatches 

are shown in Figs. 6(b) and 6(c). Notice that at 

β ≤ −

1

 the instability growth rates 

are  quite  high  and  thus  will  lead  to  a  fast  decay  of  the  corresponding  wave  in  the 

whole  range  of  its  existence.  The  important  result  revealed  here  is  that  at 

β ≥ −

1

 

the situation drastically changes: While exponential instabilities are still possible in a 

narrow  band  of  propagation  constants  (Fig.  6(a)),  the  maximal  value  of  the 

corresponding  growth  rate  inside  this  band  is  very  small  compared  with  typical 

growth rates encountered when 

β ≤ −

1

. Moreover, when the mismatch  β  increases, 

the maximum value of the growth rate inside the instability band quickly drops off. 

This is consistent with the suppression of exponential instabilities of sn-type waves in 

the large positive phase mismatch limit, i.e., in effective Kerr medium. Therefore, on 

physical grounds the important implication is thus near phase-matching, which is the 

most  interesting  case  experimentally,  such  small  growth  rate  of  the  exponential 

instabilities  can  only  manifest  itself  after  a  long  propagation  distance,  typically  far 

larger than any feasible quadratic crystal length. 

The  “oscillatory”  instabilities  of  sn-waves  were  found  to  exist  for  all  energy 

levels  and  material  parameters.  At  negative  phase  mismatches  the  oscillatory 

instability is strong and the real parts of the complex growth rates reach almost the 

same  magnitude  as  those  associated  with  exponential  instabilities.  However  at 

positive  and  zero  phase  mismatches  the  maximum  positive  value  of  the  complex 

growth rates  Re

( )δ

 associated with oscillatory instabilities was found to be quite 

max

small  and  to  grow  monotonically  with  the  energy  flow U .  Notice  that  the  band  of 

δ
energy  flows  where  Re(

)

0.05

 rapidly increases from 

0 U≤

(cid:49)

 at 

β =

max

to 

0 U≤

(cid:49)

314

  at  β

10=

  (Fig.  6(d)).  Since  decay  length  of  the  waves  with  such 

low  increments  is  huge  the  important  conclusion  is  that  it  should  be  possible  to 

observe  sn-type  waves  experimentally.  In  the  limit 

β →

∞

  the  “metastability” 

region broadens and both oscillatory and exponential instabilities are suppressed. 

We  have  found  that  dominant  frequencies  in  the  spectrum  of  perturbation 

with  highest 

Re( )δ

  could  be  estimated  as  Ω ≈

±

[2 Im( )]δ

  and  at  moderate  and 

1/

2

high energy flows are much higher than frequencies of the own harmonics of snoidal 

 

11

waves.  This  means  that  in  the  case  of  well-localized  high-energy  waves  the  most 

“harmful”  high-frequency  perturbations  lay  far  from  the  frequency  band  of  snoidal 

waves, and could be potentially removed by spectral filtering. For example for a wave 

with 

b =
1

7

  at  β

3=

  the  frequency  band  of  the  snoidal  wave  is  given  by 

8−

Ω(cid:49) (cid:49)

8

  while  the  dominant  frequencies  in  perturbation  spectrum  is  Ω ≈

24±

 

(see  Fig.  6(e)  which  shows  the  profile  of  the  perturbation  for  this  wave).  A  typical 

scenario  of  the  instability  development  for  the  snoidal-type  waves  is  shown  in  Fig. 

6(f). One can clearly see appearance of high frequency modulations of the otherwise 

smooth profile, however the depth of this modulation is small and the wave conserves 

structural stability. 

Next we concentrate on the properties of dn- and cn-type waves in quadratic 

nonlinear media. Such waves feature arrays of bright solitons and exist at  d d
1 2

0>

. 

Therefore  further  we  set  in  Eqs.  (8)  d

1= −

, 

d = −

1/ 2

,  that  corresponds  for 

1

2

instance to spatial soliton case. Examples of dispersion diagrams and profiles of dn- 

and  cn-type  waves  are  shown  in  Figs.  7(a),(b)  and  8(a),(b),  respectively.  Waves  of 

cn- and dn-types exist for propagation constant values above a cut-off. For cn-waves 

the  cut-off  is  given  by  b

/ 2β= −

  at  −∞

β<

,  and  by  b
1

= −

1/ 2

  at  β

1>

. 

The cut-off for dn-waves is always positive; it monotonically decreases with increase 

of  the  phase  mismatch,  and  approaches  b
1

β= −

/ 2

  as  β

→ −

∞

  [44].  In  the  high-

energy, or high-localization limit, cn-type waves transform into arrays of out-of-phase 

bright solitons, while dn-type waves transform into arrays of in-phase bright solitons. 

In the low energy limit, dn-type waves transform into plane waves, whereas cn-type 

waves transform either into plane or small amplitude harmonic waves depending on 

the phase mismatch sign. 

Stability  analysis  revealed  that  dn-type  waves  are  linearly  unstable  in  the 

entire  domain  of  their  existence.  The  areas  of  existence  of  finite  perturbations 

corresponding  to  real  δ   at  β

0=

  are  depicted  in  Fig.  7(c).  The  exponentially 

growing instability is most pronounced at the low-energy limit, when  b  approaches 

1

cut-off  and  the  dn-wave  transforms  into  a  plane  wave,  and  it  is  asymptotically 

suppressed in the high-energy limit, when the dn-wave transforms into an array of in-

phase bright solitons. The typical scenario of destabilization of a perturbed dn-wave 

is shown in Fig. 7(d). The instability of dn-wave always manifests itself as fusion of 

neighboring  peaks.  Similar  results  were  obtained  for  all  values  of  the  propagation 

constant  at  different  phase-mismatches  inside  the  interval  investigated,  namely 

− ≤ ≤

20

β

20

. 

 

12

Next we consider stability of cn-type waves. On intuitive grounds, such waves 

are expected to be more robust than the dn-waves because of the alternating phase of 

the  FF,  hence  neighboring  peaks  might  tend  to  repel  each  other  and  thus  a  stable 

balance might be possible. Still, such is not the case, e.g., in self-focusing cubic Kerr-

type nonlinear media where the cn-waves are unstable, too. The central result of this 

section is that such stable balance does occur with multicolor cn-waves, as shown in 

Fig.  8(c)-(f).  The  dynamically  saturable  nature  of  quadratic  nonlinearities  might  be 

important to such stabilization. The important result, shown in Figs. 8(c) and 8(d), is 

that  the  areas  of  existence  of  growing  perturbations  (Re

δ >
( )

0)

  vanish  when  the 

propagation  constant  exceeds  a  certain  critical  value  b .  Taking  into  account  that 

cr

dispersion  dependencies  are  monotonic  (Fig.  8(a)),  it  means  that  above  the 

corresponding  energy  threshold,  the  families  of  multicolor  cn-waves  become 

completely free of linear instabilities with exponential growth. Fig. 8(f) indicates that 

the  threshold  energy  for  stabilization  decreases  when  the  phase  mismatch  β   goes 

from 

−∞

  to  approximately  0.25.  Thus,  stable  cn-waves  occur  almost  in  the  whole 

range of its existence at small positive and negative 

β

. For example, at 

β = −
3

 we 

have  found  stable  cnoidal  waves  for  b
1

≥

b

cr

≈

2.382

,  while  at  β

0=

  the  region  of 

stability  begins  at  b

≈

0.192

.  The  exponential  instabilities  of  low-energy  cn-waves 

cr

associated with purely real growth rates exist at −∞

<

β ≤

1

. 

In  the  region 

0.25

(cid:49)

β < ∞

  we  have  also  found  oscillatory  instabilities 

associated with complex growth rates. Such instabilities also cease to exist when the 

energy  flow  exceeds  a  threshold  value  (Fig.  8(e)).  For  oscillatory  instabilities  the 

critical  value  of  the  propagation  constant  also  decreases  as 

β

  goes  from  ∞   to 

approximately  0.25.  The  key  result  of  this  section  is  thus  summarized  in  Fig.  8(f), 

which  shows  the  threshold  value  of  the  propagation  constant  for  complete 

stabilization versus phase mismatch. 

To  confirm  the  results  of  linear  stability  analysis  we  performed  a  set  of 

simulations  of  Eqs.  (7)  with  the  input  conditions  q

envelope modulating the infinite periodic pattern. For sn-type waves we have found 

that in some cases (when growth rates predicted by linear stability analysis are small 

enough)  perturbed  sn-waves  with  low  and  moderate  energy  flows  can  survive  up  to 

one  thousand  propagation  units  exceeding  any  feasible  crystal  length  by  several 

orders  of  magnitude  (Fig.  9).  The  band  of  energy  flows  corresponding  to  such 

“metastable”  propagation  quickly  increases  with  growth  of  phase  mismatch,  as 

 

13

predicted  by  the  stability  analysis.  As  in  the  case  of  regular  perturbations  in  linear 

stability  analysis  in  the  case  of  random  perturbations  instability  of  high-energy  sn-

waves  manifests  itself  in  appearance  of  high  frequency  oscillations  and  lead  to  the 

behavior analogous to that depicted in Fig. 6(f). 

Figs. 10(a)-(d) illustrate the outcome of numerical simulations of propagation 

of  perturbed  cn-waves.  The  typical  decay  of  low-energy  cn-waves  is  shown  in  Fig. 

10(a). Beyond the point of spontaneous onset of the instability, the wave is rapidly 

destroyed.  In  clear  contrast,  Figs  10(b)-(d)  illustrate  the  stable  propagation  of 

perturbed cnoidal waves for several values of phase mismatch and energy flow. The 

cnoidal waves kept their input structure for all the monitored propagation distances, 

in some cases over several thousand units. 

4. Concluding remarks 

Summarizing, we have shown the existence of completely stable periodic wave 

patterns  in  both  saturable  Kerr-type  and  quadratic  nonlinear  media.  From  a 

theoretical  viewpoint,  these  findings  motivate  the  investigation  of  the  existence  and 

properties of periodic waves in more general models, such as in media with competing 

quadratic-cubic, or cubic-quintic, or in optical tandems. From a conceptual point of 

view, the stable periodic waves may be viewed as bright and dark “soliton crystals,” 

composed  of  individual  soliton-like  “atoms”.  Such  concept  might  find  applications, 

e.g., in one-dimensional versions of soliton-based image processing techniques [49,50], 

or  in  the  formation  of  reconfigurable  light-induced  periodic  waveguide  arrays  in 

future photonic circuits.

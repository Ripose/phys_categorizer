ABSTRACT 
 
In  this  report  we  analyze  the  feasibility  of  ionospheric  monitoring 
using  GNSS  technology.  The  focus  will  be  on  the  use  of  LEO  GNSS 
data,  exploiting  GNSS  Reflections,  Navigation  and  Occultation  TEC 
measurements. 
 
In order to attack this question, we have simulated GNSS ionospheric 
TEC  data  as  it  would  be  measured  from  a  polar  LEO  (exploiting 
Navigation,  Occultation  and  Reflection  TEC  data)  and  IGS  ground 
stations,  through  the  use  of  a  climatic  ionospheric  model  (we  have 
explored both NeQuick and PIM). 
 
We have also developed a new tomographic approach inspired on the 
physics of the hydrogen atom, which has been compared to previous 
successful  but  somewhat  awkward  methods  (using  a  voxel 
representation)  and  employed  to  retrieve  the  Electronic Density field 
from the simulated TEC data. 
 
These 
simulated  data 
demonstrate  the  significant  impact  of  GNSS-R  and  GNSS-NO  data: 
3D  ionospheric  Electron  Density  fields  are  retrieved  over  the  oceans 
quite  accurately,  even  as,  in  the  spirit  of  this  initial  study,  the 
simulation  and  inversion  approaches  avoided  intensive  computation 
and sophisticated algorithmic elements (spatio-temporal smoothing). 
 
We  conclude  that  GNSS-R  data  can  contribute  significantly  to  the 
GIOS (Global/GNSS Ionospheric Observation System).

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Ionospheric  Electron  Content  measurements  are  an  important  element  for  Space 
Weather  research  and  operations.  Adverse  conditions  in  the  space  environment 
can  cause  disruption  of  satellite  operations,  communications,  navigation,  and 
electric  power  distribution  grids,  leading  to  a  variety  of  Socio-economic  losses. 
The  initial  focus  of  this  program  will  be  on  better  coverage  of  data-void  or  data-
sparse  regions  (e.g.,  data  over  the  oceans,  complementary  data).  Little  data  on 
ionospheric electron content is presently available over the oceans, although this 
situation  will  be  mitigated  by  occultation  measurements  (CHAMP,  COSMIC),  and 
the  vertical  character  of  GNSS-R  soundings  together  with  their  availability  over 
water (and perhaps ice and land) covered areas will be able to fill these gaps.  
 
It is well known that the atmosphere affects the propagation of radio signals. Both 
the  neutral  troposphere  and  the  ionosphere  have  an  impact  on  ranging 
measurements from radar systems. In fact, it has been an important goal for the 
GPS/GNSS research community to test the limits of the geophysical measurement 
techniques derived from this technology. Both the troposphere and the ionosphere 
have  been  an  object  of  intense  research  exploiting  the  fact  that  GPS  (L  band) 
signals are susceptible to the atmospheric gas and plasma distribution. This, tied 
to  the  high  precision  of  the  GPS  system,  has  opened  a  wide  door  to  study 
atmospheric phenomena. 
 
Because of the existence of ionised free electrons, the ionosphere adds a delay of 
a  few  meters  to  the  GNSS  signal  (L  band).  The  exact  amount  depends  on  the 
Electronic  Density  along  the  ray  link  path  and  on  which  of  the  GNSS  available 
frequencies is considered (e.g., in GPS, f1 = 1.57542 GHz and f2=1.22760 GHz). 
The dispersive nature of this phenomenon is exploited to measure the integrated 
free  electron  content  delay  accurately,  and,  if  needed,  to  remove  it  from  the 
measurements  (as  in  dual  frequency  GPS,  for  example).  Consider  a  signal 

travelling at time t, between a given satellite and receiver, and let 

)(ρ

dlx

 be

the  integrated  electron  density  along  the  ray  traversed  on  by  the  signal  (in 
electron per square meter). Then the delay at Di is modelled by: 

 

 

 
where α=40.30 m3/s2, Di is the geometric length of the real ray, Ds.l. is the length 
of  the  ray  if  it  travelled  in  a  straight  line  (in  the  vacuum),T  models  other 
frequency independent terms, and ci
sat and ci
rec are the instrumental biases (which 
are  assumed  to  remain  constant).  The  last  term  is  the  difference  between  the 
length of the real ray and the length of the ray if it propagated in the vacuum and 
is also small for non-grazing geometries. 
 
Ionospheric  delay  on  GPS  depends  on  the  Integrated  Electron  Density,  or 
Total Electron content (TEC) along the ray link path and is usually expressed

for  tomography  of  the 

in  electrons  per  square  meter  divided  by  1e16  (TEC  units  or  TECU).  Electron 
Density  is  usually  expressed  in  number  of  free  electrons  per  cubic  meter  (ED). 
Typical peak value ED are of the order of 1E12 electrons per cubic meter and are 
found around 300 km of altitude.  
 
An  approach 
is  through  the  voxel 
representation  [Ruffini,  1998].  An  important  problem  in  voxel  tomography  is 
that  it  is  in  general  an  ill-determined  problem:  the  data  is typically not sufficient 
to  uniquely  specify  a  solution.  Many  approaches  are  possible  to  address  this 
problem. The problem in the present approach is linear, of the form y= A x. The 
matrix  A  is  the  "integration  matrix".  It  has  as  many  rows  as  there  are  data 
measurements  (one  for  each  ray),  and as  many  columns  as  there are unknowns 
(one for each voxel plus the bias constants). Its entries, then, are the lengths of 
the ray portions spent in each voxel, plus a 1 or 0 depending on the satellite and 
receiver involved (in the bias sector of A). The equation y=Ax is converted into a 
chi-square  problem:  we  have  to  minimize  (y-Ax)2.  There  are  many  solutions, 
however,  and  this  is  reflected  by  the  fact  that  A^T  A  has  zero  determinant.  The 
approach  we  will  typically  take  to  solve  this  problem  is  to  add  a  constraint,  and 
minimize  (y-Ax)2+(Bx)2.  These  constraints  are  normally  smoothing  constraints. 
This is a natural choice. If data is missing in some portion of the grid we ask that 
the  solution  interpolates  x  using  the  data  from  other  places.  Thus,  the  grid  does 
not set the effective resolution of the solution, which can be coarser depending on 
data availability. It is important to note that the constraint will have strong effect 
in  areas  of  low  data  availability,  while  in  areas  with  abundant  data  they  will  not 
interfere  too  much.  The  effective  resolution  of  the  system  is  thus  not 
homogeneous,  but  will  vary  depending  on  the  area’s  data  availability(cid:151)a  good 
point.  
 
A promising approach for tomography of the ionosphere is the ingestion of GPS 
data into models. In previous work [Ruffini 2001] we investigated the possible use 
of  spaceborne  GNSS  Reflections  (GNSS-R)  to  sound  the  ionosphere,  a  possibility 
already  discussed  in  [Komjathy  1996].  [Ruffini  1998]  analysed  GPS  data  to 
extract  information  about  the  ionospheric  electron  density  distribution.  [Ruffini 
1999]  ingested  GNSS  TEC  data  into  PIM  using  a  simple  least-squares  approach, 
and obtained good fits to GPS data (40 cm of post-residual mean, compared to 30 
using full blown tomographic methods involving many more parameters). The key 
for  carrying  out  this  idea  was  the  availability  of  the  integration  matrix  from  the 
tomographic  approach,  which  was  used  as  observation  operator  in  the  ingestion 
functional.  
 
The possibility of using GNSS-R ionospheric data is of high interest: GNSS-R would 
provide  a  higher  number  of  vertical,  or at least oblique, bi-TEC measurements over 
the  oceans,  an  important  missing  piece  in  a  future  GNSS  Ionospheric  Monitoring 
System.  It  is  known  that  ionospheric  electron  content  data  measured  along  vertical 
directions, when ingested in global ionospheric models, highly enhances the accuracy 
of such models since they complement occultation soundings. Little data with these 
characteristics  is  presently  available  over  the  oceans,  and  the  vertical  character  of 
GNSS-R soundings together with their availability over water surfaces (and perhaps 
ice or land) covered areas will be able to fill these gaps.

As  concluded  in  WP3500  of  the  Paris  Beta  ESA/ESTEC  project  [Ruffini  2002], 
Ionospheric  electron  content  data  estimated  from  GNSS-R  can  and  should  be 
ingested in Global Ionospheric models.

2 SIMULATING GNSS TEC data 

 
Our goal in this feasibility study is to perform tomography of the ionosphere using 
the  combined  data  of  GNSS  LEO  (navigation,  occultation  and  reflections)  and 
ground  data  in  a  synergy,  to  produce  realistic  3D  models  of  the  electron  density 
content  of  the  atmosphere.  To  tackle  this  problem  we  have  simulated  the 
ionosphere  using  PIM  (a  climatic  model)  and  we  use  a  virtual  GPS  constellation 
and  a  single  LEO  satellite.  Simulations  have  been  carried  out  using  the  current 
GPS  constellation  and  a  polar  LEO  orbiter,  as  well  as  the  current  IGS  ground 
network.  A  polar  orbiter  is  a  good  choice,  as  discussed  in  the  Starlab  Petrel 
proposal, as it provides global coverage for many applications. 
 
Note, however, that for the purposes of ionospheric monitoring, the conditions for 
observation  are  rather  different  than  for  other  types  of  EO.  This  is  because  the 
ionosphere is quasi-static in an inertial frame. Therefore, a single LEO will only be

able to sample a rather fixed slice of the ionosphere. Ground stations and filtering 
techniques can be used to propagate the slice solution elsewhere, but at a price in 
precision. 
 
Only  one  LEO  orbit  has  been  implemented  in  our  simulation.  This  is  because  the 
goal of this initial study was limited to the demonstration of the impact of GNSS-R 
data in the GIOS. As discussed, GNSS-R data has the biggest impact over the 
oceans, where there is presently no data, and where GNSS-ON data will only able 
to provide horizontal TEC. For the purposes of demonstration, we aimed to show 
that over a given slice over the oceans we could produce a sensible ED solution. 
 
In  the  simulation  we  have  considered  the  following  3  sources  of  ionospheric 
(slant) TEC data: 
 
•  GNSS-G data: this TEC data is produced from the present 300+ IGS stations 
on the ground. These stations provide a steady source of mostly vertical TEC 
around the globe. 

•  GNSS-ON  data:  this  is  TEC  data  produced  from  GNSS  LEO  occultation  and 
navigation: any LEO-to-GPS link TEC. Ray links for GNSS-ON data will typically 
be colour coded green in the graphs below. 

•  GNSS-R data: this denotes GPS-to-Ground-to-LEO TEC. Ray links for GNSS-R 

data will be colour coded red. 

 
Gaussian  noise  was  also  added  to the data. Using the above-discussed figures, 
we  added  an  error  of  10  TECU  after  10  seconds  of  averaging  (a  rather 
conservative assessment) for GNSS-R data, as we now discuss. The other types of 
GNSS data are not very affected by noise (sub-TECU).  
 
According  to  present  models  and  experiments,  GNSS-R  code  bistatic  ranging  data 
has  an  intrinsic  noise  of  less  than  0.5  meter  (about  5  TECU)  after  1  second  of 
integration,  with  the  assumption  of  a  reasonably  large  antenna  (25-28  dB).  Thus, 
this data holds great potential value to ionospheric science, even if only code ranging 
data  is  available  and  the  phase  cannot  be  tracked.  Ionospheric  tomography  will 
benefit  greatly  from  GNSS-R  data  for  an  additional  reason:  as  mentioned  above,  it 
complements the geometry of occultation data (with very horizontal ray paths) very 
nicely, at least over the oceans.  
 
Recall that for the GPS LI combination (using L1 and L2) 1 TECU is equivalent to 10.5 
cm  of  LI  delay  and  that  typical  vertical  TEC  is  between  0  and  50  TECU  (see  next 
Figure).  
 
GPS  and  Galileo  are  designed  as  multi-frequency  systems  because  the  ionospheric 
contribution to the delay can be removed by making use of its dispersive nature. In 
fact the (cid:147)ionosphere-free(cid:148) linear combination of delays to a good approximation does 
not depend on ionospheric electron content. The problems of gathering data from a 
reflection  situation  and  from  an  occultation  are  fairly  similar.  It  is  also  worth 
mentioning  that  even  if  only  one  frequency  is  available,  comparison  of  phase  and 
group  ionospheric  delays  (of  equal  magnitude  but  opposite  sign)  can  yield 
ionospheric electron estimates.

We  discussed  above  the  potential  accuracy  from  a  high  gain  mission,  e.g.  with  an 
antenna  of  25-28  dB.  In  the  context  of  low  gain  missions  (with  antenna  gains  of 
about  15  dB),  such  dual  frequency  code  measurements  would  also  be  of  great 
interest  for  ionospheric  applications.  Using  dual  frequency  code  pseudo-ranges, 
current models predict that the ionospheric combination double-slant delays could be 
measured  to  better  than  2  meter  after  1  second  of  integration,  leading  to  vertical 
TEC measurements of about 15 TECU accuracy after 1 second, or about 3 TECU after 
20 second averaging.  
 
The  expected  accuracy  of  single  frequency  code-phase  delay  measurements  would 
also  be  very  useful  (the  error  being  dominated  by  the  code  part  of  the 
measurements). 
 
The  use  of  phase  measurements  would  increase  even  more  the  interest  of 
ionospheric GNSS-R measurements. We have seen indications in our simulations that 
the  phase  of  the  ionospheric  combination  is  very  well  behaved  after  scattering,  as 
expect from the use of an (cid:147)infinite(cid:148) synthetic wavelength (using the language in the 
PARIS Interferometric Processor context)(cid:151)see [Ruffini 2002]. 
 
This  could  imply  that  accurate  GNSS-R  ionospheric  phase  measurements  will  be 
possible  from  space.  Moreover,  the  behavior  of  ionospheric  phase,  according  to  our 
simulation, is not sensitive to sea state conditions.

For ease of computation, TEC data was only provided with a rather low cadence of 
3  minutes.  This  is  a  significant  factor,  as  in  reality  much  more  data  will  be 
available. Nonetheless, we believed (correctly, as it turns out), that even with this 
meagre data rate we could demonstrate the power of this technique. 
 
 
We  decided  to  use  Parameterised  Ionospheric  Model  (PIM)  to  generate  3D  ED 
fields  with  a  resolution  of  about  10  degrees,  and  developed  our  own  integration 
routines to produce TEC along any geometry.

3 TOMOGRAPHIC APPROACH: THE H-REPRESENTATION 

 

 
Previous  approaches  have  focused  on  voxel  representations.  Voxels  are  local 
support  representations.  This  fact  alone  makes  them  inefficient  when  not  the 
whole ionosphere is sampled---as will be the case here and rather generally.  
 
We  have  worked  with  a  new  representation  developed  at  Starlab  (which  we  call 
the H-representation), based on the solutions to the Schrodinger equation for the 
Hydrogen atom. 
 
This  representation  is  non-local.  This  means  that  if  data  is  available  at  only 
specific  regions  of  the  ionosphere,  all  the  coefficients  in  the  representation  can 
contribute to the fit. This allows for a good fit where there is data at the expense 
of  sparsely  sampled  regions.  The  H-Representation  also  offers  the  advantage  of 
easy integration of smoothing terms to account for data scarcity.

 

 
Previous approaches have focused on voxel representations, and we are aware of 
their  limitations.  Voxels  provide  a  local  support  representation.  This  makes  them 
inefficient when not the whole ionosphere is sampled(cid:151)as will be the case here and 
rather  generally.  In  addition,  they  provide  a  discrete  and  non-homogeneous  (in 
volume) support representation. 
 
The  H-representation  is  non-local.  This  means  that  if  data  is  available  at  only 
specific  regions  of  the  ionosphere,  all  the  coefficients  in  the  representation  can

of sparsely sampled regions. 
 
It also offers the advantage of easy integration of smoothing terms to account for 
data gaps.
 
The representation used is of the form:

(1) 

following  the  Schr(cid:246)dinger  solution  to  Hydrogen  atom.  Here  Ylm  are  the  spherical 
harmonics, and Rn,l is the radial function:

In  the  hydrogen  atom,  a0  corresponds  to  the  Bohr  radius.  In  our  case  this  is  a 
parameter  to  determine  to  optimize  the  fit.  Our  simulations  show  that  good  fits 
are  given  by  a0  between  20  and  30.  This,  however,  will  depend  on  the  largest 
value of n allowed (see discussion below). 
 
Note  also  that  in  equations  (2)  we  have  added  an  additional  ρ  in  the  equation 
compared with the hydrogen solution for computation purposes.

4 TOMOGRAPHIC RESULTS 

 
As  can  be  seen  in  the  Figures  below,  the  H-representation  provides  an  efficient 
way to represent the solution space. 
 
With as little as n=5 (55 coefficients) we obtained a fit of 7 TECU under the LEO 
track, using only LEO data (Figure 20), will with the addition of IGS ground data 
gave a fit of about 13 TECU. 
 
The  addition  of  ground  data  from  a  few  stations  provided  a  better  global  fit,  as 
expected. 
 
In Figure 4 we see the results of the n=8 TEC fit. 
 
The main results are in the following table:

TABLE1-  Results  for  differents  parameters  of  the  H-representation.  Xi-errors  were 
computed in the TEC ionosphere (fouth row) and in the ED ring (fifth row). The first result 
in the fifth row is the Xi with GNSS-R data and the second one is the Xi without GNSS-R 
data. The last four columns are calculated with a smothing constraint.  

 
 

We show the H-order and number of coefficients, the a0 parameter, the slant TEC 
fit, and the ring fit, with/without GNSS-R data. 
 
Thus,  we  see  that  as  expected,  as  the  order  of  n  and  the  number  of  coefficients 
increase  a  better  fit  results.  It  is  clear  that  using  GNSS-R  data  improves  the  ED 
results  on  the  Orbital  Ring  (see  Figure  22  for an explanation of this concept), as 
expected,  although  a  bigger  impact  is  expected  at  higher  n.  Figure  22  and 
onwards  illustrate  ED  profiling  with  and  without  GNSS-R  data  to  highlight  the 
above numbers. 
 
As  expected,  the  a0  parameter  must  be  tuned  to avoid  putting  weight  above  the 
area of interest. According to the formula for the Bohr radius, r0 =n2 a0. Thus, we 
should seek to have the support from the radius functions below 1000 km.  
 
In  the  last  four  rows  (blue)  we  show  preliminary  solutions  with  a  smoothing 
constraint penalizing high n components of the solution (this is done by adding a 
term of the form λ[n2].to the χ2). 
 
Finally,  recall  that  spherical  harmonic  representation  resolution  is  of  the  order  of 
180/n. Thus, for n=8 we are at about 22 degrees of spatial horizontal resolution, 
and about 100 km vertical resolution.  
 
At  n=14  we  would  have  about  1000  unknowns,  a  horizontal  resolution  of  13 
degrees,  and  about  50  km  vertical  resolution.  At  n=20  we  have  almost  3000 
unknowns, for 9 degrees of resolution. This is the resolution we actually used for 
PIM. To these unknowns we will have to add the emitter-receiver biases (one per 
GPS satellite and GPS receivers).

without  the  addition  of  constraints.  With  the  3  minute  cadence.  No  ground  data  was  used, 
only LEO.

5 CONCLUSIONS  
 

 

In  this  study  a  new  representation  has  been  used  in  order  to  model  the 
ionosphere and study the impact of GNSS data for tomography.  

A new tomography (H-representation), using solutions similar then used to solve 
the hydrogen atom solution to Schr(cid:246)dinger equation, provides and efficient way to 
represent the solution space. With as little as n=5 (55 coefficients) we obtained a 
fit of 7 TECU under the LEO track, using only LEO data, while with the addition of 
IGS ground data gave a fit of about 13 TECU. Using more coefficients, and adding 
smoothing constraints, the solutions gets become more accurate.  

As  expected,  the  addition  of  ground  data  from  a  few  stations  provided  a  better 
global  fit.  On  the  other  hand,  GNSS-R  data  improves  significantly  the  ED  results 
on  the  Orbital  Ring  (where  they  provide  data)  so  it  can  be  concluded  that  the 
addition of GNSS-R data can cover a crucial gap over the oceans, where (cid:147)ground(cid:148) 
(vertical) data is not available.

Abstract

A possibility of a few  MeV electron beam diagnostics (Lorentz factor ~ 10) using polarization

characteristics  of  the  optical  transition  radiation  (OTR)  have  been  considered.  Determinaton  of  the

electron beam divergence have been performed with technique based on the OTR measurements. The

technique  is  based  on  measuring  the  ratio  R=Imin/Imax, where  Imin(Imax)    is  the  photon  yield  in  the

minimum (maximum) of OTR angular distribution. It is shown that the value of  R can be obtained also
from the measurement of the so-called y

-scan of the OTR yield registered by a fixed detector with the

aperture  £

g -1 by varying the target tilt angle with respect to the electron-beam.

The experiment curried out at 6.1  MeV  Tomsk  microtron  has  demonstrated  the  feasibility  of

the technique proposed.

1. Introduction

Keywords: Relativistic electrons, transition radiation, beam diagnostics

Beam  diagnostics  based  on  optical  transition  radiation  (OTR)  (see,  e.g.,  [1])  is  widely  used  in
electron  accelerators  within  the  energy  range  101-104  MeV  [2-4].  OTR  is  commonly  employed  to

measure  the  transverse  beam  size  and  divergence,  while  coherent  transition  radiation  is  used  in  the

millimeter wavelength region to measure a length of short electron bunches [5].

Electron beam divergence can be defined from the shape of the OTR angular distribution (from

a single interface or, using the interference methods, from both ones). CCD camera can be used for this
purpose.  But  for  low-energy  beams  (E  ~
  10  MeV),  the  OTR  cone  becomes  quite  broad,  which
decreases the light flux per CCD pixel. With a sensitivity of 103 photons/pixel and the pixel area 100
m m2, the optical system converting the OTR angular distribution into a 25 mm2 CCD  image  ensures  an
exposure of 0.5 photons per pixel for an electron bunch containing 108 electrons.

This traditional technique is insufficient in this case. However, the usage of a photo multiplier

tubes (PMT) more sensitive than CCD camera would provide the required information. Since a PMT

measures the total light flux only the information regarding OTR angular distribution may be obtained

in the following manner.

 In the next paragraphs we show that for a small aperture (

gq

1-

, g   is  a  Lorenz-factor)  the

shape  of  the  measured  orientation  dependence  has  the  same  typical  features  as  the  OTR  angular
distribution.  It  means  the  beam  diagnostics  may  be  based  on  the  measurements  of  y

-scans  (with

polarizing filters upstream PMT too). In this paper we demonstrate the feasibility of proposed scheme.

2. Theoretical model

The theory of OTR generated by charged particle crossing an inclined infinite screen has been

developed in [6] (for a perfectly conducting screen) and with taking into account the optical properties

of  screen  material  in  [7].  In  the  optical  range  the  OTR  intensity  from  such  material  as  polished

aluminum differs slightly from ideal screen [8]. So we shall consider the latter case for simplicity.

OTR intensity components polarized in the reflection plane (I||) and in the normal one (I^) can

be written As [6]:

The OTR angular distribution for  g =10  in  the  reflection  plane  and  for  Y =p

One may see the similarity of both distributions. The difference between right and left parts of

distributions  (“large  shoulder”  and  “small  one”)  is  defined  by  Lorentz-factor  only.  Large  and  small

shoulders exchange for y

-scan due to “reflection” of virtual photons by screen.

The asymmetry ratio is:

where I+max (I-max) – the maximal value of the OTR intensity for the large (small) shoulder.  This  value

is the same for both figures; A=0.198.

It  is  evidently  (see  fig  2)  the  main  part  of  OTR  intensity  is  concentrated  in  a  cone  with  apex  angle

  relative  to  the  specular  reflection  direction.  For  a  relativistic  case  (g >>1)  it  is  more

conveniently  to  use  other  coordinate  system  where  z-axis  coincides  with  this  direction  (see  fig.1),

where the new angular variables may be written as [9]:

Even for  g =5 the agreement between approximate equation (8) and exact formula (1) is rather

good (see fig. 5) so we use the last expression for calculations with diverging electron beam.

To  illustrate  our  approach  let  us  consider  the  2D  model  where  the  divergence  of  the  initial

beam is described by uniform distribution:

To obtain the initial beam divergence effect on resulting OTR angular distribution one should calculate

a 2D convolution of distribution (8) and (9)

From  Fig.7  it  can  be  seen  that  there  is  the  significant  contribution  from  the  perpendicular  polarized

component.  Other  effect  from  diverging  electron  beam  is  the  “smoothed”  nonzero  minimum  along

specular reflection direction (compare fig.2 and 6).

The  “contrast”  between  minimal  and  maximal  values  of  OTR  intensity  may  characterize  the

beam divergence effect. Let’s introduce the following criterion:

approximation will remain good for divergences 

.

The 2D integral  Eq.(10)  is  calculated  analytically  for  our  model  electron  divergence  (9)  using

It is obvious that the results obtained are valid for the detector with an infinitely small aperture.

Since to measure the coefficient R (from the measured y

aperture, it is necessary to run addition-folding procedure. To calculate the OTR yield in the circular
detector aperture with an angular size acceptance D

as a function of  s

,  is  different  from  the  non-polarized  case  by  a  factor  of  ½  and  it  is  the  same  in

comparison to the detector aperture contribution. So the usage of a polarizing filter for this case is not

effective.  However,  for  the  flat  electron  beam  (see  Eq.  (22,23)  the  effect  of  beam  divergence  in

OTR component for diagnostics is preferable in this case.

Having these results we can find the beam divergence from experimental data. Parameter ó

3. Experiment

The experimental study of OTR dependence characteristics on electron beam parameters were

performed at the microtron of NPI TPU. The main designed microtron parameters are as follows:

Electron energy                                6.1 MeV
Macropulse duration                                            2 – 6 m s

The beam parameters allow us to consider the electron beam as a flat one and we can use the

formulas (22,23,25).

The  experimental  layout  is  shown  in  Fig.8.  Four  quadruple  lenses  ensure  the  electron  beam

focusing  on  the  target.  The  beam  size  can  be  monitored  with  a  video  camera  from  the  scintillation-

counter display and, to obtain a more precise vertical beam size – with a wire scanner.

OTR  target  was  made  from  a  thin  aluminum  mirror  deposited  onto  a  ceramic  substrate.  Their

thickness was (cid:31) 1ìm and 0.22 mm, respectively. The target was fixed in the  goniometer and could be

rotated using a step motor. The electron current and the forward bremsstrahlung yield from the target

were also measured. In order to take the radiation background into account, the latter was measured for

each target position with the shutter closing the entrance window of PMT. All the measurements were

normalized with respect to the electron beam current. Magnetic lenses used in the experiment made it

possible  to  vary  the  beam  size  focused  on  the  target.  Following  the  beam  focusing,  the  orientation

characteristics  of  transition  radiation  were  measured.  For  a  fixed  beam  emittance,  the  angular

divergence decreases with increasing the linear beam size.

OTR was measured using a PMT located at 90° to the beam direction at the distance of 1200

mm  from  the  target.  The  circular  collimator  placed  on  the  detector  was  20  mm  in  diameter,  which
corresponds to the aperture d = 0.1 in units of 1/g . Fig.9 and Fig.10 present the measured curves of the

  (in  other  words  for  different  beam  divergences).  It  is  evident  from  the  figures

that the beam divergence severely affects the orientation dependence shape.

same in the visible range, we believe that the instrument asymmetry associated with the rotation of the

Summary

The  possibility  of  low-energy  electron  beam  diagnostics  using  the  polarization  characteristics

of optical transition radiation (OTR) has been considered. The OTR yield  y

-scans has been offered as

a tool to investigate the beam characteristics. Calculations have shown that it is the radiation polarized

in  the  reflection  plane  (parallel  component)  that  is  of  the  greatest  interest  for  diagnostics.  The

orientation dependence of this component has certain peaks and dips that disappear with an increase in

angular divergence of the initial electron beam. The ratio R of the radiation yield in the dip to half sum

of the  maxima  has  a  unique  dependence  on  angular  divergence  and  can  be  used  for  measurement  of

one.  The  experimental  study  of  the  OTR  component  in  reflection  plane  was  carried  out  at  the

microtron of the Nuclear Physics Institute with electron energy 6.1  MeV, the orientation dependence.

It has been shown the  R-ratio depends on beam size, which can be used to estimate beam divergence.

Also, the parallel and perpendicular components of OTR are given. The nonzero contribution from the

perpendicular  component  along  the  specular  direction  is  attributed  to  beam  divergence  and  the

geometry of the experiment. Similar patterns were obtained in the calculations taking into account the

experimental  geometry.  Unfortunately,  only  a  wire  scanner  was  available  in  the  experiment  to  verify

the  beam  size,  and  no  means  for  the  angular  beam  divergence.  Nevertheless,  the  proposed  technique
allows us to analyze the beam divergence from ratio R that may be measured from y

-scan easily.

In  Ref.  [10]  it  was  noted  that  determination  of  a  beam  divergence  from  the  shape  of  OTR

angular pattern for 1MeV electrons is ineffective.

13

We  have  demonstrated  experimentally  that  y

-scans  can  provide  the  same  information

regarding  such  typically  measured  features  as  the  shape  of  its  angular  pattern.  The  technique  offered

can be used to an advantage for the beam intensity as low as 108 

se /

  due  to  high  sensitivity  of  the

detector used (PMT).

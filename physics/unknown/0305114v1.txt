Common sense tells us that a small variation in external conditions  results in a correspondingly small physical 

response.    For  example,  a  tiny  increase  in  the  force  applied  to  a  spring  causes  a  bit  of  additional  stretching, 

while moving uphill a few meters results  in only a miniscule change in barometric reading. Such behavior, when 

equilibrium  properties  response  smoothly  to  variations  of  external  forces  or  parameters,  can  be  considered 

"normal". 

However, in real life things quite often don't work that way.  For example, increasing the load on a branch can 

result  in  its  suddenly  breaking  with  a  painful  fall.    Gradual  decrease  in  the  temperature  causes  an  abrupt  

transition of water from liquid to solid.  When crossing Cape Cod, even at its narrowest (about a mile), many are 

surprised by the dramatic change in ocean temperature (from comfortably warm to freezing cold). 

The explanation of such abnormalities often requires very complex physics and mathematics. Some aspects of 

these, including the "butterfly effect", are well publicized, thanks to Dr. Malcolm, a charismatic scientist from the 

"Jurassic Park".  However, examples of catastrophic changes in response to a gradual variation of external 

conditions can also be discussed with no more than simple high school physics.  An illustration can be found in 
the challenging problems offered to our old acquaintances 1, Jeff and Fred, by  Mrs. Walker, their AP physics 
teacher. ( See also 2  for another, slightly more complex, example that still requires only High School physics). 

The statement of the problem 

There are two charges, 

Q

 and  q .  Both the position and value of 

0Q >

 are fixed while 

q

 has a varying value 

and is attached to an insolating spring with a spring constant 

Γ

. If 

q =

0

, the equilibrium distance 

l

 between the 

charges is equal to 

 (see Fig. 1). For any 

0l

z >

0

, find the value of 

q

 for which  

l

zl=
0

.  Verify the stability of 

equilibrium corresponding to the 

q

  that you found and analyze the solution. 

Challenge  Assume that charges 

Q

 and 

q

 are surrounded by the hard shells of finite radius, restricting the 

distance of their closest approach by a certain value z

min  (1) How the equilibrium properties of this 

electromechanical system depend on  zmin? (2) How the behavior of this system can be affected by the uniform 

electrostatic  field applied along the line connecting the charges. 

The boys discuss the problem 

(Coulomb) force acting on  q  

First, Fred and Jeff realized that in equilibrium the electric and elastic forces should be in balance. The electric 

is

 where

 is the electrostatic constant. The positive direction of 

QF , corresponding to 

q >

Qq

l

(repulsion,

), is the direction from 

Q

 to 

q

.   The elastic force defined by  Hook’s law is

)

The condition that the resultant force becomes zero leads  to the equation

Introducing  the  dimensionless  distance

  and 

considering

 they decided to  rewrite this equation

calculator and punched the keys.  

The resulting plot looked quite surprising (see Fig. 2). 

Although  some of its features, such as behavior  at  

 , looked very reasonable (you can ask your students 

z

z≥

min

to explain a continuous growth of 

( )q z

 

in this range ), some others seemed to 

be  really  unusual.  Thus,    the  boys  

expected  that,    when  the  negative 

charge 

q

  grew  more  negative,  it 

would  continuously    approach  Q until 

the  charges  come  in  direct  contact 

(

z =

0

). In other words, they expected 

the  curve 

( )q z

  to  continuously  decay 

until 

z

=

0

  was  reached    at  some 

q <

0

.  Apparently,  this  was    not  the 

case.      The  allowed  values  of 

q

 

appeared 

to  be  constrained 

from  

below by  

min ~ 0.15 /
q
−

γ

 

which 

did 

not 

correspond to 

z =

0

.  To the contrary, 

the corresponding  separation 

minz

 was quite big, 

~ 0.7

3. In addition,   for each value 
 

minq

q< <

0

, there were  two 

(not one) equilibrium roots: 

'

z

z>

mi

n

, and 

z

′′ <

z

mi

n

.  The boys had to decide which of two solutions  was the “real 

one”. 

Confronted with these puzzles, Jeff suddenly remembered another problem that  they had solved in class. 

That  time they were trying to find the equilibrium position of a negative charge in the presence of two equal 

positive charges.  They suggested at first that the negative charge will reside right in the midpoint, but Mrs. 

Walker asked them to check if the equilibrium was stable. For this purpose, they drew the position dependency of 

combined electric force acting on the charge. Although the forces were balanced  in the midpoint, even  a tiny 

displacement in either direction resulted in a force pushing the charge away from the equilibrium point. It was like 

a knife  balancing on its tip. The only stable configuration  corresponded to the negative charge resting right on 

one of two positive charges. This memory  produced the  idea of analyzing the force as a function of  z, which 

turned out to be fruitful. They rewrote the  total force

negative, then the equilibrium is stable (the force resists the disturbance)

4 . Such are the solutions

. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  positive  slope  indicates  that  the  equilibrium  is  unstable.    The  unstable  (fictitious) 

equilibrium  solutions 

''z

 exist for any negative 

q

.

 While the 

elastic force grows very smoothly (~ 1-z) when 

q>

min

z  decreases, 
the  electrostatic  attraction 
skyrockets  (~1/z2)  at  small  z.  Consequently, 

for  any 

q <   a  domain  of  separations

exists where the attraction dominates 

over 

the  elastic 

force,  and 

the  charges 

collapse.

 The unstable equilibrium solution 

''z  

is the upper boundary of such a domain. This 

domain  of  instability  becomes  wider  as 

q

 

grows  more  negative.  Finally,  at   

q

q≤

the 

electrostatic 

attraction 

prevails 

at 

all  

separations,  and  the  only  equilibrium

  loca

tion 

for  q  becomes right on the top of   Q .  

“That’s  amazing!”  –  Fred  was  excited-  “The 

equi ibrium  completely  disappears far 

 

l

before 

the  charges  touch  each  other.  I  still  have  to 

digest 

this 

idea.  This  problem 

is  really 

fantastic! 

“I agree”, responded Jeff, “It was a good one! I 

wonder if the same thing happens with two magnets. You can’t 

bring magnets close to each other without their jumping together.  

I got a cool magnetic construction set for my birthday, and we can do all kinds of experiments. But for now let’s go 

out and play ball. We can write it all down after the game. And tomorrow we can deal with the challenge”.  

 

T

he challenge 

Let  us  now  outline 

the  solution  to  the 

challenge,  focusing 

on  the  effect  of  the 

electric field.  According to (1), z is restricted 

from  below  by  the    “distance  of  the  closest 

approach”,  zmin . The “hard shells”  prevent  

Q    and  q    from  collapse.  If  joined,  they  can 

be now pulled apart by a moderate external 

electric 

field  (unlike 

the  point  charges 

considered above that can not be separated 

after  they  collapse).  This  brings  our  model 

closer 

to 

the  molecular  “electro-elastic” 

systems,  where 

different 

(finite-size) 

charged  groups  are  attached 

to 

 

the 

molecular “springs”.  The changes in the applied voltage  result  in 

c

hanges in the molecular conformation. Such 

devices  can  be  important,  for  instance,    in  the  voltage  gating

 

of  ion  channels  inserted  in  the  biological 

membranes.  In presence of the electric field F , the Eq. 3 should be rewritten as

previously  mentioned,  such  a  phenomena  can  be  related  to  the voltage  gating  of  ion  channels,  which  can  be 
accompanied by movement of the “gating charges” across the membrane 5,6. Further analysis of this relation can 

 

be  offered    as  a  research  project  aiming  to  introduce  students  to  the  physical

The instabilities are related to non-linear propertie

s and their analysis typically requires advanced mathematical 

tools.  Probably,  for  this  reason,  such  problems  are  avoided  even  in  Honors  and  AP  Physics  Textbooks.  For 

instance  ,  many  variations  of  a  problem  with  two  equally  charged  bodies  suspended  on  two  strings  are  quite 
popular 6, while I was unable to find a single discussion of this problem with two opposite charges.  

To  avoid  the  difficulties  of  solving  a  cubic  equation  which  would  require  dealing  with  complex  numbers,  Mrs. 

Walker  used  a  trick.  Instead  of  asking  how  the  equilibrium  distance  depends  on  charge  she  reversed  the 

question.  Her  students  were  challenged  to    find  a  charge  corresponding  to  a  given  equilibrium  distance  that 

required  only  simple  and  direct  calculations.  Previous  experience    directed  Jeff  and  Fred    to  a  graphical 

representation  of  the  problem,  and  made  the  whole  discussion    more  focused  and  enjoyable.    The  same 

approach can be applied to various problems, including the above problem with the opposite charges suspended 

at a finite separation.  

A  similar  problem  would  result  from  replacing  the  charges  with  magnets.  The  attraction between magnets  can 

typically lead to a beha

vior similar to that considered above. Students can be asked how the equilibrium distance 

d

epends on the position of the fixed end of the spring.  Such 

a problem allows a simple experimental analysis. For 

my experiments I used a wonderful construction toy, the “Rogers Connections”, which is available in many stores 

and on the Internet (I bought it in the neighboring “The Construction Site” store http://w

). 

It consists of plastic struts tipped with small high-power magnets and steel balls. The only addition that I needed 

 

 

was a soft spring. Enjoy!

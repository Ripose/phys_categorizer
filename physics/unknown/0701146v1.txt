The  Circle  of  Apollonius  is  named  after  the  ancient  geometrician  Apollonius  of  Perga.  This  beautiful 

geometric construct can be helpful when solving some general problems of mathematical physics, optics and 

electricity.  Here  we  discuss  its  applications  to    the    “source  localization”  problems,  i.g.,  pinpointing  a 

radioactive source using the set of Geiger counters. The Circles of Apollonius help analyze  these problems 

in  transparent  and  intuitive  manner.  This  discussion  can  be  useful  for  High  School  Physics  and  Math 

curriculums. 

1. Introduction  

2. Apollonius of Perga helps to save 

We  will  discuss  a  class  of  problems  where  the 

Sam 

position  of  an  object  is  determined  based  on  the 

analysis  of  some  “physical  signals”  related  to  its 

location.  First, we pose  an entertaining problem 

that  helps    trigger  the  students’  interest  in  the 

subject. Analyzing this problem. we introduce the 

Circles  of  Apollonius,  and  show 

that 

this 

geomteric  trick  allows  solving  the  problem  in  an 

ellegant and transparent  way. At the same time , 

we  demonstrate  that  the  solution  of  the  “reverse 

problem”  of  localizing  an  object  based  on  the 

readings  from  the  detectors,  can  be  nonunique. 

This  ambiguity  is  further  discussed  for  a  typical 

“source 

localization” 

problem, 

such 

as 

pinpointing  a  radioctive  source  with    a  set  of 

detectors. It is shown for the planar  problem that 

the  “false source”  is  the  inverse point  of  the  real 

one  relative  to  the  Circle  of  Apollonius  passing 

through 

the 

set  of 

three  detectors.  This

Bartholomew  the  Frog  with  Precision  Hopping 

Ability  could  hop  anywhere  in  the  world  with  a 

thought and a leap [1]. Publicly, he was a retired 

track and field star. Privately, he used his talent to 

help  save  the  world.  You  see,  Bartholomew  had 

become  a  secret  agent,  a  spy  -  a  spook.  In  fact, 

only  two  people  in  the  whole  world  knew  who 

Bartholomew  really  was.  One  was  Sam  the 

Elephant  and  the  other  was  Short  Eddy,  a 

fourteen-year-old  kid  who  did  not  have  a  whole 

lot of normal friends but was superb in math and 

science. One day an evil villain Hrindar platypus 

kidnapped  Sam  the  Elephant.  Bartholomew,  as 

soon  as  he  realized  Sam  was  missing,  hopped 

straight  "to  Sam  the  Elephant."  When  he  got 

there,  he  was  shocked  to  see  Sam  chained  to  a

decided to focus on the two lighthouses, A and B, 

the  lights  from  three  lighthouses.  Two  of  them, 

say A and B, were on land, while the third one, C, 

first.  Apparently, S is one of all possible points P

photometer  from  his  spy  tool  kit,  Bartholomew 

found that the corresponding brightnesses were in 

proportion 9:4:1. He hopped to Eddy and told him 

what was up. Eddy immediately Googled the map 

of  the  area  surrounding  Landport  that  showed 

three lighthouses (see Fig. 1). ABC turned to be a 

right  triangle,  with  its  legs  |AB|=1.5  miles  and 

|AC|=2  miles.  The  accompanying  description 

asserted  that  the  lanterns  on  all  the  lighthouses 

were the same. In a few minutes the friends knew 

the  location  of  the  boat,  and  in  another  half  an 

hour,  still  under  cower  of  the  night,  a  group  of 

villain.  The  question  is,  how  did  the  friends 

manage 

to 

find 

the  position  of 

the  boat  

Discussion and solution 

Being  the  best  math  and  science  student  in  his 

class, Eddy immediately figured out that the ratio 

of the apparent brightness could be transformed in 

the ratio of the distances. According to the inverse 

square  law,  the  apparent  brightness  (intensity, 

luminance)  of  a  point  light  source  (a  source  can 

be  considered  point-sized  if  its  dimensions  are 

small comparative to the distance r to the source) 

is proportional to 

2/ rP

, where P is the power of 

reminded  Eddy  of  something  that  had  been 

discussed in the AP geometry class. That time he 

was  very  surprised  to  learn  that  in  addition  to 

being the locus of the points equally distant from 

a center, a circle can also be defined as a locus of 

points whose distances to two fixed points A and 

B are in a constant ratio. Eddy rushed to open his 

lecture notes and... Here it was!  The notes read: 

"Circle  of  Apollonius  ...  is  the  locus  of  points  P 

whose  distances  to  two  fixed  points  A  and  B  are 

in a constant ratio

1:γ .  

For  convenience,  draw  the  x-axis  through  the 

points  A  and  B.  It  is  a  good  exercise  in  algebra 

and geometry (see the Appendix) to prove that the 

radius of this circle is

The  examples  of  the  Apollonius  circles  with  the 

fixed  points  A  and  B  corresponding  to  different 

values of  γ are shown in Fig. 2. Interestingly, 

which  one  is  the  boat?"  "That’s  easy"-  Eddy 

the Apollonius circle defined by the Eq. 1 is

This  result  immediately  follows from  the Eqs. 2 

and 3. (Apollonius of Perga (240-190 b.c.e.) was 

known 

to  contemporaries  as  “The  Great 

Geometer”. Among his other achievements is the 

famous book “Conics” where he introduced such 

commonly used terms as parabola, ellipse and  

hyperbola [2])”. 

 Equipped with this information, Eddy was able to 

draw  the  Apollonius  circle 

1L   for  the  points  A 

and  B,  satisfying  the  condition  γ=1/2    (Fig.  3). 

smiled joyfully- "The grey dot is far inland which 

leaves us with only one possible location!”.  And 

Eddy  drew  a  large  bold  "S"  right  next  to  the 

orange  dot.  Now  it  was  peanuts  to  discover  that 

the  boat  with  poor  Big  Sam  was  anchored 

approximately 0.35 mile East and 0.45 mile North 

from A. Bartholomew immediately delivered this 

information to the commandos, and soon Big Sam 

was  released.    Once  again,  the  knowledge  of 
physics  and  math  turned  out  to  be  very  handy. 

3.    The  question  of  ambiguity  in  some 

source localization problems  

Our friends have noticed that the solution of their

problem  was  not  unique.    The  issue  was  luckily 

of  this  circle

resolved,  however,  because 

the  “fictitious” 

found  that

mile

  which  implies 

that the center O of the circle  1L  is 1 mile to the 

south from A. In the same manner Eddy built the 

Apollonius  circle 

2L   for  the  points  A  and  C, 

corresponding  to  the  ratio  γ=|PA|/|PC|=1/3.  Its 

location  happened  to  be  inland.  In  general,  such 

an  ambiguity  can  cause  a  problem.  Had  both  the 

intersection points appeared in the ocean, a wrong 

guy  could’ve  been  arrested  while  the  evil  villain 

escaped.  How  to  prevent  this  from  happening? 

We address this question using a setting which is 

radius is 

2 =R

5.1

 miles and the center Q is 0.25 

more typical for the localization problems. In the 

miles to the West from A.  Eddy put both circles 

on the map. Bartholomew was watching him, and 

holding  his  breath.    "I  got  it!"-  he  suddenly 

shouted.    "Sam  must  be  located  in  the  point  that 

belongs  simultaneously  to  both  circles,  i.e.  right 

in  their  intersection.  Only  in  this  point  his 

distance  to  A  will  be  2  times  smaller  than  the 

distance to B and at the same time 3 times smaller 

than  the  distance  to  C".  "Exactly!"-  responded 

Eddy,  and  he  drew  two  dots,  grey  and  orange. 

Now  his  friend  was  confused:  "If  there  are  two 

possible  points,  how  are  we  supposed  to  know 

previous  discussion  a  measuring  tool,  the  photo 

detector,  was  positioned  right  on  the  object  (the 

boat)  while  the  physical  signals  used  to  pinpoint 

the  boat  were  produced  by  the  light  projectors. 

More  commonly,  the  signal  is  produced  by  the 

searched  object  itself,  and  it  is  read  by  the 

detectors 

located 

in  known  positions.  The 

practical examples are a radioactive source whose 

position  must  be  determined  using  the  “Geiger 

counters”  or  a  light  source  detected  by  the  light 

sensors.  Assuming  that  the  source  and  detectors    

are  positioned  in  the  same  plane,  there  are

three unknown parameters in the problem: two 

coordinates  and  the  intensity  of  the  source  P. 

One  can  suggest  that  using  three  detectors 

would  be  sufficient 

for  finding  all 

the 

unknowns.  The 

corresponding 

solution, 

however,  won’t  be  unique:  in  addition  to  the 

real source, it will return a false source, similar 

to 

the  grey  dot 

found  by  Eddy  and 

Bartholomew. 

How can we  make the solution unique?  This 

will  be  discussed  below  using  the  circles  of 

Apollonius. Consider first a source S of power 

Ik. After that, using the Circles of Apollonius, 

we show that another (“image” or “fictitious”) 

source  exists 

that  exactly  reproduces 

the 

readings  generated  by 

the 

real  source.  

Obviously,  this  indicates  that  the  reverse 

problem  is  not  unique.  Finally,  we  discuss  a 

possible  approach  to  resolving  this  ambiguity 

and pinpointing the real source. 

To  proceed,  we  first  formulate  the  following 

conjecture: “For any point A and any circle L, 

a  point  B  exists  such  that  L  is  an  Apollonius 

Circle with the fixed points A and B“.

words, finding B by inversing A relative to an

Thus,  it  is  impossible  to  distinguish  between 

the  real  source  and  its  image  based  on  the 

readings  from  the  (isotropic)  detectors  placed 

on  the  same  circle.  This  is  exactly  the  reason 

for  the  ambiguity  (nonuniqueness)  of  the 

reverse  problem.  The    Eqs.  5  will  inevitably 

return two sets of parameters, one for the real 

source  and  the  other for  the  false  source.  It  is 

also  obvious  now  that  adding  any  number  of 

detectors  to  the  original  set  of  three  will  not 

resolve  the  ambiguity  if  all  the  detectors

the  previous  analysis  for  another  triad  of

circle L1 (see Fig. 4), we can find a new pair of 

solutions:  the  original  source  S  and  its  image

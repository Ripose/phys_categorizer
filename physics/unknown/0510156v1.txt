Abstract 

A plasma based isotopic separation method is proposed. Isotopes of diffferent masses get separated 
during  plasma  expansion.  Relying  on  Gurevich’s  (A.V.Gurevich, L.V.Pariïskaya and L.P.Pitaevskii, 
Sov.Phys.JETP,  36,274  (1973)  )  plasma  expansion    into  a  vacuum  model,  the  enrichment  factor  has 
been calculated. For  ô =15 (ô being the normalized time), an increase of the relative abundance of 30% 
is expected.  

 
In  nature,  uranium  is  found  in  a  mixture  state  consisting  of  approximately      1% 
of  235U  and 99% of  238U  .  Unfortunately,  it  is  the  least  abundant  isotope  ( 235U) that is 
of  prime  importance  in  many  situations,  e.g.,  in  thermal  neutrons  reactors  it  is  the 
isotope  that  sustains  the  chain  reaction;  hence,  it  is  necessary  to  increase  its  relative 
abundance.  This  process  being  the  enrichment.  For  research  reactors,  enrichment 
ranges from 6 to 90 %, whereas it ranges from 1.1 to 1.5 % for power reactors. To this 
end,  several  methods  have  been  devised  to  achieve  uranium  enrichment,  viz.,  gaseous 
diffusion,  centrifugation,  laser  based  and  plasma  based  isotopic  separation  methods1. 
In  this  letter,  we  propose  a  method  based  on  plasma  peculiarities,  viz.,  the  separation 
of ions during plasma expansion into vacuum.  
We  consider  a  plasma  of  electrons  and  238U+  ions  along  with  impurity  ions 
 
235U+.  We  rely  then  on  Gurevich  et  al.2  model  of  a  plasma  expanding  into  vacuum,  in 
order  to  derive  the  densities  of  the  ions  and  the  enrichment  factor  accordingly,  with 
respect  to  the  self-similar  variable  ô.  The  evolution  of  the  ions  distribution  functions

At  large  values of  ô,  the  thermal  spread  of  the  velocities  may  be  neglected,  due  to  the 
increase of the translational velocities.

i.e.,  during  plasma 
expansion,  ions  of  different  masses  get  separated  in  space.  The  electrons  move ahead 
under  the  influence  of  their  own  pressure,  leading  to  the    generation    of  a  self-
consistent  electric  field  that  drives  the  ions  according  to  their  respective  inertia.  Using 
a  simplified  plasma  expansion  model,  we  found  an  increase  of  30%  of  the  relative

of  a  thought  experiment  only,  hence  in  order  to  meet  the  requirement  of  a  real 
situation,  we  have  to  cope  with  a  set  of  physical  parameters  such  as  different  reaction 
rates  occuring  during  the  process  (e.g.,  recombination..).  We  emphasize  also  that 
isotopic  separation  is  highly  relevant  in  medical  physics,  especially  that  very  small 
quantities are needed.

ABSTRACT. 
Thermodynamic simulation of chemical and metallurgical systems is the only method to predict 
their equilibrium composition and is the most important application of chemical thermodynamics. 
Regardless the basic approach – Gibbs’ free energy minimization, maximization of the reaction 
entropy,  or  solution  to  the  equations  for  equilibrium  constants  −  the  conventional  strategy  is 
always to find the most probable chemical and phase composition of the system, corresponding to 
the so called true thermodynamic equilibrium. Traditional simulation methods do not account for 
interactions within the chemical system. The Method of Bound Affinity (MBAi) is based on the 
theory that explicitly takes into account interactions between subsystems of a complex chemical 
system  and leads sometimes to essential differences  in simulation results. This article discusses 
peculiarities  of  MBA  application,  exemplified  by  results  for  a  complex  system  with  a  set  of 
subsystems. 

INTRODUCTION. 
 
Practical application of chemical thermodynamics is related to a great extent to thermodynamic 
simulation  of  the  chemical  systems.  The  goal  of  the  simulation  is  to  find  the  most  probable 
chemical and phase composition of the equilibrium system. Maximum probability corresponds to 
thermodynamic equilibrium, the only state recognized as equilibrium by current theory. The well-
known  Zeldovitch’s  theorem  [1],  asserting  a  uniqueness  of  the  equilibrium  state  for  isolated 
system, forms a cornerstone of the application, thus prompting us to search that unique point in 
the space of states of the chemical system. In the most of the simulation software developed up to 
now  [e.g.,  2,3,4],  the  standard  search  usually  consists  of  finding  the  global  minimum  of  the 
system’s Gibbs’ free energy.  
Recently  introduced  ideas  in  the  thermodynamics  of  chemical  equilibrium,  presenting  the 
equilibrium as a balance of the thermodynamic forces [5,6], explicitly account for the interactions 
between subsystems of a complex system, leading to more detailed and accurate evaluation of the 
system’s  composition  in  chemical  equilibrium.  At  constant  pressure  and  temperature,  chemical 
equilibrium follows the logistic equation

equilibrium  due  to  that  interaction,  expessed  by  thermodynamic  temperature.  An  appropriate 
diagram, constructed from solutions of equation (1), forms the domain of states of the chemical 
system,  and  has  4  consecutive  typical  characteristic  areas.  For  thermodynamic  simulation,  two 
leftmost  areas  (see.  Fig.1)  are  of  the  most  practical  interest  –  the  area  of  thermodynamic

equilibrium (TdE) housing the states with zero deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium, and 
the area of the open equilibrium (OpE) where the subsystem’s state deviates from TdE but still 
dwells on the thermodynamic branch. The parabolic term of equation (1) equals to zero within the

TdE  area  due  to  δj
system may be considered isolated, and traditional thermodynamic simulation is applicable there. 
*≠ 0. The system ceases to be isolated; now 
The second is the area of open equilibrium where δj
the parabolic term should be taken into account. Beyond the OpE area, the thermodynamic branch 
becomes unstable, and there follow areas of bifurcations and then chaos. The name of parameter 
τj reminds that its increase leads the chemical system through those areas. The area limits in term 
of  τj  depend  upon  the  “strength”,  i.e.  the  value  and  the  sign  of  standard  change  of  Gibbs’  free 
energy of the chemical reaction, running within the system.  

SOME FEATURES OF THE MBA.

The curves from zero point of the reference frame up to the fork bifurcations corresponds to the 
thermodynamic  branch  of  evolution  of  the  chemical  system  [8],  and  is  obviously  broken  by  2 
parts  -  the  horizontal  and  ascending.  The  horizontal  part  is  TdE  area,  and  the  ascending  parts 
before bifurcations are related to the open equilibria (OpE). At the first bifurcation point, which 
is the OpE limit, the thermodynamic branch decays, splitting into two new non-stable branches. 
Further increase of the  τj  value leads to doubling of bifurcation period and eventually to chaos. 
Both equilibrium areas are typical for any direction of the system’s deviation from equilibrium,

It  is  obvious  from  equations  (1)  and  (2)  that,  depending  upon  the  system  states  location  in  the 
*=0 where one doesn’t have 
domain, we have either classical case of isolated equilibrium with δj
to take into account τj in the calculations, or open equilibrium where we have to account for τj. 
The  TdE  limit  defines  the  transition  from  the  classical,  conventional  simulation  to  the  non-
classical approach. Regardless of the simulation problem, it is very important to know the domain 
of states characteristic points τTdEj and τOpEj, in order to apply the proper algorithms. 
Thermodynamic  simulation,  based  on  the  MBA,  includes  a  search  for  the  area  limits  and  for 
dependence of τj on deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium within the OpE area. This search 
includes every subsystem of a complex chemical system at the given initial amount of moles for 
the  participants  of  j-reaction  n0
j.  When  those  parameters  are  found,  the 
thermodynamic simulation consists of the joint solution for the set of logistic equations (2) using 
corresponding  τj  values.  Another  option  is  to  minimize  Gibbs’  free  energy  of  the  subsystems, 
while also accounting for the subsystem interactions.

AREA LIMITS AND REDUCED CHAOTIC TEMPERATURE. 
 
The area limits may be spotted by direct computer simulation given the initial composition and 
thermodynamic parameters. At the same time the limits, τTdE and τOpE can be found analytically 
with  a  good  precision,  avoiding  any  simulation.  Recall  that  equation  (2)  contains  2  functions, 
*=0 (Fig. 3) in the beginning of 
logarithmic and parabolic. Both have at least one joint point at δj
the  reference  frame,  providing  for  a  trivial  solution  to  equation  (2)  and  retaining  the  system 
within the TDE area. The curves may cross somewhere else at least one time more; in this case 
the  solution  will  differ  from  zero,  and  number  of  the  roots  will  be  more  than  one.  There  is  no 
intersection if  

d(τδ∆)/dδ < d[ln(Π`/Π*]/dδ.                                             (4) 

This condition leads to a universal formula to calculate the TDE limit as 

τTDE =1+ηjΣ [νkj/(n0

kj−νkjηj)] , 

                            

(5) 

where n0
kjis the initial amount and νkj is the stoichiometric coefficient of the k-participant in the j-
*<0 
system. We offer this derivation to the reader to check for correctness. Though the area with δj
is more complicated, formula (5) is still valid in cases when the system gets exhausted from one 
or  more  of  the  reactants  before  the  minimum  of  the  logarithmic  term  occurs.  For  the  reaction 
A+B=C  (exact  stoichiometric  image  of  reaction  (4))  with      initial     amounts  of  participants  of 
respectively 1, 1, and 0 moles, formula (5) may be written down as

The dependence of the area limits upon the standard change of Gibbs’ free energy for reaction 
(4)  is  shown  in  Fig.  5.  Apparently,  the  “stronger”  the  reaction  in  the  system,  i.e.  the  more 
negative its standard change of Gibbs’ free energy, the more extended is its TdE area along the 
τj axis; both limits, TdE and OpE get closer with the increase of negative ∆G0
j, merging at its 
extreme for this reaction value. 
To perform calculations in the OpE area one has to know the value of τj. The phenomenological 
theory offers several ways to find it. In the more general method, τj can be found directly from 
equation (1) as

An alternative method consists of finding the equilibrium composition and the appropriate ηj and

point-by-point  method  is  illustrated  by  Fig.  6,  where  ▪RO  stands  for  restricting  oxide  of  the 
couple.  The  standard  change  of  Gibbs’  free  energy  of  the  double  oxide  formation  from  oxides 
was accepted as the TDF. 
Needless to say, prior to the search for τj one has to find ηj for the reaction in question at given 
temperature. It can be done by any traditional simulation method for thermodynamic equilibrium

EXAMPLES. 
 
The  MBA  obviously  consists  of  2  steps  –  mandatory  solutions  for  isolated  subsystems  precede 
solutions for the interacting subsystems.  
The  following  example  is  a  graphical  image  of  domains  of  states  for  a  hypothetical  chemical 
system  with  5  subsystems.  We  tried  to  show  possible  different  locations  of  the  subsystems  in 
their domains of states in equilibrium. The internal pentagon connects the TdE limit values of the 
subsystems,  the  external  pentagon  does  the  same  for  OpE  limits;  the  pentagon  with  the  marks 
connects conditionally simulated τj values.     
How different may be results of conventional and MBA thermodynamic simulation? To answer 
this  question,  we  used  several  chemical  systems  with  2  subsystems  where  different  reactions 
between  a  couple  of  double  oxides  and  hydrogen  can  run.  Double  oxides  were  taken  to  reduce 
reaction activity of the basic oxides, in other words, to make the reaction less “strong”, allowing 
usage  of  the  non-zero  parabolic  term  in  the  OpE  area  in  calculations.  For  example,  binding  of 
CoO into CoO▪TiO2 lowers equilibrium reaction constant from 32.09 for

values of τj, found by the point method for MeO and MeO▪TiO2: Reactions NiO and NiO▪TiO2 
with hydrogen τj = 29.04; for CdO-reactions τj = 21.13; for CoO-reactions τj = 18.57. 
The difference between results of classical and MBA simulations is quite discernable.

CONCLUSION. 
 
Described peculiarities of the Method of Bound Affinity at constant temperature and pressure and 
ways  to  find  area  limits  and  running  values  of  τj,  allow  for  application  of  the  MBA  to 
thermodynamic simulation of chemical systems. Results by a classical simulation method and the 
MBA are quite different; the new theory prompts us to consider the MBA results to be in better 
correspondence  with  real  chemical  systems.  Some  results  of  this  work  were  presented  in  part 
earlier on [10].

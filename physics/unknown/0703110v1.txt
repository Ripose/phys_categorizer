Abstract: A room temperature operating Vertical External Cavity Surface Emitting Laser is 
applied  around  1550  nm  to  intracavity  laser  absorption  spectroscopy  analyzed  by  time-
resolved Fourier transform interferometry. At an equivalent pathlength of 15 km, the high 
resolution spectrum of the semiconductor disk laser emission covers 17 nm simultaneously. 
A  noise  equivalent  absorption  coefficient  at  one  second  averaging  equal  to  1.5  10-10  cm-
1.Hz-1/2 per spectral element is reported for the 65 km longest path length employed.

Over the past few years, spectroscopy in the near-infrared region of the spectrum has benefited 
from  the  substantial  development  of  laser  technology  associated  with  the  1.3  and  1.5  µm 
telecommunication  bands.  Compact,  stable,  and  high-power  sources  have  been  developed  for 
various commercial and technological applications and have thus served as an impetus for active 
research in this wavelength region. Seat of the weak overtone molecular transitions, the 1.5 µm 
region has prompted the need for high sensitivity spectroscopic techniques, reaching now the ppb 
detection levels. One of the prevailing quests presently aims at combining these sensitivities with 
rapid diagnostic times and/or multi-species gas analysis.  
Since its introduction in the 1970's, Intracavity Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (ICLAS) has been 
recognized [1] as one of the most sensitive techniques. The absorbing sample is placed inside the 
resonator  of  a  multimode  laser,  the  gain  spectrum  of  which  is  broader  than  the  absorbing 
transitions  to  be  detected.  From  the  beginning  of  the  laser  pulse  to  the  time  of  observation  t
 

g
(generation time), absorption follows the Lambert-Beer law with an equivalent path length equal 
to  (ℓ
  the  length  of  the  cell  containing  the

due to kilometric absorption path lengths and large spectral detection bandwidth due to the broad 
spectrum  of  multimode  lasers.  ICLAS  experiments  have  been  performed  with  various  types  of 
broadband  laser  sources.  In  particular,  Optically-Pumped  Vertical-External-Cavity  Surface-
Emitting  Lasers  (OP-VECSELs)  on  GaAs  substrates  have  proved  their  efficiency  in  the  1  µm 
region [2,3] and recently around 2.3 µm with Sb-based materials [4], pumped by commercial low 
power GaAs-based diode lasers.   
Indeed, VECSELs constitute a promising family of versatile solid-state lasers for spectroscopic 
purposes,  with  their  low  laser  threshold,  circular  diffraction-limited  output  beam  [5]  and  large 
tunability and gain bandwidth [2-4]. A recent review is included in [6]. In the 1.55 µm water-free 
region, VECSELs represent potential compact tunable laser sources, which are in high demand 
for  various  applications.  In  this  region  however,  semiconductor  structures  are  based  on  InP 
systems,  such  as  ternary  (e.g.  InGaAs)  or  quaternary  (e.g.  InGaAsP)  materials,  which  exhibit 
lower  thermal  conductivity  than  binary  materials  (e.g.  GaAs,  AlAs)  grown  on  GaAs  substrates 
for the 0.8 - 1 µm range. Moreover, because of the low refractive index contrast, a high number 
of  InP/GaInAsP  mirror  pairs  are  required  to  form  high  reflectivity  distributed  Bragg  reflectors. 
The  resulting  structures  display  high  thermal  impedance  which  prevents  efficient  heat  removal 
from  the  active  region  to  the  heatsink.  Therefore,  the  development  of  these  structures  has  not 
been  as  successful  as  for  the  0.8-1  µm  region.  However,  room  temperature  (RT)  operation  of 
monolithically grown structures in simple compact two-mirror cavities has already been reported 
[7,8].   
In this letter, we report the first application of a 1.55 µm RT-CW OP-VECSEL to high resolution 
spectroscopy,  with  the  implementation  of  a  sensitive  ICLAS  set-up  analyzed  by  time-resolved 
Fourier transform spectroscopy.   
The broadband laser consists of a ½-VCSEL structure designed for optical pumping at 980 nm by 
a commercial diode laser. The structure is composed of a Bragg mirror and a multiple-quantum-
wells  active  region.  The  ½-VCSEL  is  mounted  in  an  external  cavity  with  standard  dielectric 
mirrors in order to constitute the VECSEL device. The monolithic structure has been grown [7] 
on  a  400  µm  InP  substrate  by  metal-organic  vapor-phase  epitaxy.  The  Bragg  mirror  of  the  ½-
VCSEL  structure  is  formed  by  48  pairs  of  InP/InGaAsP  quarterwave  layers  resulting  in  a 
reflectivity  R>99.8%.  The  active  region  is  made  of  three  half-wave  groups  of  a  strain-
compensated package of two GaInAsP quantum wells. These layers are embedded between two 

 

3 

InP  layers  (0.75  and  2.25  λ)  enhancing  the  heat  dissipation,  because  of  its  good  thermal 
  ~  65  K.W-1.m-1).  An  anti-reflection  coating  has  been  deposited  on  the  top 
conductivity  (K
C
surface of the ½-VCSEL to prevent a Fabry-Perot effect in the sub-cavity formed by the active 
region, thus to broaden the modal gain bandwidth in the external cavity [2].  
As shown in Fig. 1, the ½-VCSEL is mounted onto a copper heat sink to control its temperature 
with  a  Peltier  module,  stabilized  by  a  thermistor  and  a  temperature  controller.  The  structure  is 
optically-pumped with a fiber-coupled 980 nm laser diode focused on a radius spot size of about 
30 µm, matching the fundamental cavity mode. This size is fixed by thermal effects in the active 
region. A larger cavity mode would quadratically increase the pump power needed to reach the 
laser  threshold,  leading  to  higher  temperatures  inside  the  active  region  –  as  the  thermal 
impedance decreases approximately linearly with pump radius - and preventing the occurrence of 
the laser oscillation. The L-shaped external cavity is formed by the ½-VCSEL, a concave (125 
mm radius of curvature) and a plane dielectric high reflectivity (R>99.97%) wedged mirrors. The 
cavity  has  a  1-m  long  collimated  arm,  providing  a  longitudinal  mode  spacing  of  ~140  MHz. 
Laser oscillation in CW operation occurs around 1550 nm at 295 K with a threshold pump power 
of  about  100  mW.  The  central  wavelength  can  be  tuned  between  1545  and  1555  nm,  through 
temperature variation of the ½-VCSEL and by moving the chip, thereby taking advantage of the 
growth  rate  non-uniformity.  For  ICLAS  experiments,  the  pump  current  is  modulated  by  a 
function  generator  in  order  to  operate  in  quasi-CW  regime.  The  inset  in  Fig.  1  shows  typical 
shapes of the pump and laser pulses. The pump pulse duration is chosen between 100 µs and 1 
ms,  and  the  pump  power  is  about  1.1  times  the  threshold.  The  copper  heatsink  temperature  is 
maintained  at  10°C.  An  absorption  cell  with  Brewster-angled  windows  may  be  inserted  in  the 
collimated  arm  and  fills  about  60  %  of  the  cavity.  The  light  leaking  outside  the  plane  high 
reflectivity  mirror  (T<0.03%)  is  sent  into  a  homemade  high-resolution  stepping-mode  time-
resolved Fourier-transform interferometer equipped with an infrasil beamsplitter and two InGaAs 
photodetectors. At a given path difference step, several time samples are recorded from a given 
laser  pulse  and  several  pulses  are  co-added.  At  the  end  of  the  experiment,  there  are  as  many 
interferograms as there are time samples [9]. Each time-component interferogram corresponds to 
a spectrum at a particular absorption path length.  
Spectra  have  been  recorded  under  various  experimental  conditions,  with  or  without  the 
absorption  cell  inside  the  laser  cavity.  Figure  2  exhibits  54  time-components  from  a  64-
component  time-resolved  spectrum,  separated  from  each  other  by  3.2  µs.  The  maximum 
generation  time  is  220  µs  and  the  unapodized  spectral  resolution  is  5.5  pm  (22  10-3  cm-1). The 
width (FWHM) of the VECSEL emission spectrum is at most 7 nm for tg =50 µs and decreases 
  down  to  3  nm  for  a  generation  time  of  200  µs.  The  spectral  width 
[1]  proportionally  to  1

gt

follows  this  theoretical  square-root  dependence  at  least  up  to  800  µs.  Due  to  the  temperature 
increase in the active region with the generation time, which is related to the thermal response of 
the InP-based structure, the central wavelength shifts towards longer wavelengths during a pump 
pulse.  It  varies  from  about  1545  nm  up  to  1549  nm  at  the  end  of  a  200  µs  pulse.  The  band 
structure on the first time-component spectrum presented in Fig.2 is the P branch of the 30011-
00001 band of CO2, filling the cell at a pressure of about 200 Pa. Even though this spectral area is 
an atmospheric window, water absorption profiles are easily observed when the cell is removed 
from the cavity only filled then with ambient air.  It is illustrated in the inset in Fig.2 representing 
a  small  portion  of  a  time-component  (path  length:  65  km)  belonging  to  another  time-resolved 
spectrum.  Figure  3  provides  an  expanded  high-resolution  portion  of  the  first  time-component 
spectrum of Fig 2 . The P(28)e to P(44)e lines of the 30011-00001 band of CO2 are observed at 9

km path length (taking into account the 60% cavity filling ratio).  
In the spectra presented in Fig. 2, signal to peak-to-peak noise ratio is at best of the order of 300 
and rms noise of the order of 0.1 %, on the higher time components spectra. The absorption path 
length is at most of 65 km. Consequently, the minimum detectable absorption coefficient is about 
5 10-10 cm-1 which is consistent with the previous results for ICLAS with VECSEL sources [2-4]. 
As  the  experimental  time  is  2h10  min  for  about 95 000 effective independent spectro-temporal 
elements, the noise equivalent absorption coefficient at one second averaging is 1.5 10-10 cm-1.Hz-
1/2 per spectral element. This result compares well with highly efficient recent cavity ring down 
reports  [11-13]  in  the  same  spectral  region.  The  present  experiment  is  fully  automated  and 
provides a global consistency of the measurements.   
Future  directions  include  developing  a  more  compact  set-up.  Improved  VECSEL  structures 
would be a benefit for the experiment: in particular, a broader tunability would be of interest for 
fundamental  and  applied  spectroscopy,  with  an  increased  number  of  potential  species  to  be 
probed. A better management of thermal effects would lead to better sensitivity and versatility. 
The use of a intra-cavity crystalline heatspreader bonded to the gain chip surface as demonstrated 
at 1549 nm by [14] would however introduce a spectral filter, but removal of the InP substrate 
and bonding of ½ VCSEL structure on a substrate exhibiting a lower thermal impedance [5,15, 
16] appears promising.

COMPUTATION OF MEAN VELOCITY DISTRIBUTION IN A
TURBULENT FLOW

A. E. Karpelson

I. INTRODUCTION

At  the  time  being  numerous  books  and  papers  are  dedicated  to  theoretical  and
experimental  investigation  of  a  turbulent  motion  due  to  its  great  practical  and  scientific
importance.

By  using  different  experimental  methods,  we  can  obtain  the  velocity  profiles  in
turbulent  flows.  However,  we  are  not  currently  able  to  accurately  calculate  these
distributions.  Presently,  only  special  and  complex  numerical  methods  can,  to  some
extent,  predict aspects  of the turbulent flow fields. An analytical determination, at least
for  some  cases,  is  desirable,  because  it  could  lead  to  a  better  understanding  of  the
turbulent  flow  problems.  It  also  provides  a  correct  description  of  the  flows  at  various
boundary conditions and aids in the prediction of flow features.

The  Navier-Stokes  equations,  valid  for  any  turbulent  flow,  can  give  us,  in
principle,  the  instantaneous  velocity  and  pressure  distributions.  However  we  are  not
usually  interested  in  the  "fine  structure"  of  a  random  chaotic  turbulent  motion.  These
instantaneous  quantities  are  always  unsteady  and  depend  strongly  on  the  smallest
alterations  of  the  initial  and  boundary  conditions,  which  are  never  known  precisely.
Moreover,  these  quantities  are  of  no  practical  use  at  all  because  of  the  instability  with
respect to small disturbances, which always occur in any flow.

What  we  need  is  the  mean  velocity  profiles  because  only  such  distributions  can
give  a  reliable  information  about  main  statistical  characteristics  of  a  chaotic  turbulent
flow  and  can  be  compared  with  the  experimental  data.  The  mean  velocity  distributions
can  be  obtained  from  the  modified  Navier-Stokes  equations,  which  were  devised  by
Reynolds in 1895. These Reynolds equations were successfully used by many authors for
turbulent  flow  description  in  general  and  for  velocity  field  calculation  in  particular:
Boussinesq (the theory of eddy viscosity), Prandtl (the mixing length theory), Taylor (the
vortisity transport theory), Von Karman (the similarity hypothesis) and others [1-5].

As  a  result,  there  are  a  number  of  semi-empirical  or  empirical  solutions  for
velocity profiles in turbulent flows: the linear law for viscous sub-layer, power law and
logarithmic  law  for  the  whole  flow  and  their  complex  modifications  [1-5].  All  the
theories named above were based on various approximations and conjectures aimed at the
estimation  of  one  term  in  the  Reynolds  equations  containing  the  fluctuating  velocity
components.  As  a  rule, such  theories  are  valid  only for the boundary layer and so their
results  deviate  significantly  from  experimental  data  in  the  central  region  of  a  flow,  and
the solutions do not have a zero derivative at the center of flow, that leads to an unreal
broken  velocity  profile.  Moreover,  these  solutions  have  a  few  empirical  coefficients,  at
the time being there is no consensus on the exact value of these constants, which depend
on the Re number, roughness of channel wall and other factors.

In  general,  to  express  correctly  the  fluctuating  velocity  components  through  the
mean  velocity,  we  should  have  a  clear  physical  understanding  of  the  turbulent  process.

Only  modern  theory  of  turbulence  can  give  the  reasonable  explanation  of  this  physical
phenomenon.

In  this  paper  rather  simple  equations  and  their  solutions  valid  for  different
turbulent  flows  are  obtained.  They  describe  the  smooth  mean  velocity  distribution
through the entire flow, satisfy all boundary conditions and specified experimental flow
parameters.

II. GENERAL EQUATIONS

The  velocity  and  pressure  distributions  in  the  flow  of  viscous  fluid  or  gas  are

                                         

described by the Navier-Stokes equations [1-6]

In equation (1) and further we will employ the standard summation convention in

which the repeated indices are summed.

In  a  turbulent  flow  the  total  velocity  V i  can  be  represented  as  a  sum  of  a
æVi )  and  a  random  function  (the  fluctuating

deterministic  function  (the  mean  velocity  Æ

Using the equation of continuity, one can rewrite (3) in a more habitual form for

Of  course,  this  equation  should  be  analyzed  together  with  the  equation  of

continuity for mean velocity:

Now  it  is  necessary  to  solve  the  main  problem:  to  express  the  last  term  in  (4),
containing the fluctuating velocity components d
.
To  do  this  correctly,  we  will  use  the  results  obtained  in  modern  theory  of  turbulence
[4,6].

The  most  important  part  in  any  turbulent  flow  is  played  by  the  largest  eddies
(fluctuations):  they  have  the  largest  dimensions  and  the  largest  velocity  and  pressure
amplitudes  [6,  7].  It  means  that  only  the  large  eddies  influence  significantly  the  mean

characteristics  of  any  turbulent  flow  (especially,  the  mean  velocity  and  pressure
distributions).

The small eddies participate in the turbulent flow with small velocity and pressure
amplitudes.  They  may  be  regarded  as  a  fine  detailed  structure  superposed  on  the
fundamental large turbulent eddies [6, 7].

The large eddies derive their kinetic energy from the average motion of the fluid
(or  gas)  just  because  they  have  no  other  source  of  energy.  So  their  energy  space
distribution will be non-homogeneous and similar to distribution in the mean flow.

However,  a  significant  portion  of  the  large  eddies  energy  passes  to  the  smaller

eddies according to energy cascade and eventually dissipates in the smallest eddies.

In different areas of a turbulent flow there is a various number of smaller eddies.
The greater is “the degree of turbulence”  in the flow region under consideration, the more
“generations”  of smaller eddies will exist there. It is clear from the physical point of view
that this “turbulence level”  is determined by relative value of the mean velocity <V>.

So,  we  can  assume  that  in  a  boundary  layer  (for  small  <V>  values)  due  to  the
appreciable  magnitudes  of  viscous  forces  the  “degree  of  turbulence“  is  low,  i.e.  the
influence  of  small  eddies  is  insignificant  and  energy  obtained  by  the  large  eddies  from
mean  flow  mainly  remains  within  them.  In  the  central  area  of  a  turbulent  flow  <V>
values are large (i.e. “turbulence level”  is high) and the numerous small eddies, existing
there, “suck”  energy from the large eddies.

As a result, the distribution of large eddies kinetic energy density d Vi

2  in the flow
will  be  a  function  growing  from  zero  (at  the  wall  of  a  channel)  to  some  maximum
(approximately  at  the  boundary  of  viscous  sub-layer)  and  smoothly  decreasing  to  a
constant level in central region of the flow.

Emphasize, that energy taken from the mean flow is equal [1-5] to the turbulent
energy production, which, in its turn, is equal to the sum of three terms: viscous energy
dissipation, diffusion of turbulent energy (turbulent transport) and convection (advection)
of turbulent energy.

k  distribution in a turbulent flow should be similar to

The Reynolds stress  d

kinetic energy density d Vi

dV Vi
2 distribution.

Now, assuming that we understand correctly the mechanism of turbulent motion
and influence of large eddies on the mean flow parameters, we can express the Reynolds
stress  through  the  mean  velocity.  The  most  natural  way  to  do  it,  is  to  expand  the
Reynolds stress into power series with respect to mean velocity and take a few first terms
of this series:
                                               d
where A, B and D are the constants.

It is obvious, that the Reynolds stress is equal to zero at the wall of channel (there
are no velocity fluctuations at the wall) and in the center of flow (where two fluctuating
velocity  components  d Vi   and  d Vk   are  not  correlated  [2,  4]).  Between  these  points  the
Reynolds stress reaches some maximum (approximately at the boundary of viscous sub-
layer [1-5]).

To satisfy these conditions we should write (6) as follows

As a rule, the Reynolds stress (8) is positive and works against the mean velocity
gradient  removing  energy  from  mean  flow  and  passing  it  to  the  eddies.  However,  the

Reynolds stress and correlation coefficient 

 sometimes can be negative [1,

4, 7], e.g. in the small areas of a turbulent flow close to channel wall. In such a region the
mean flow gains kinetic energy from the eddies.

System of equations  (4),  (5),  (8)  describes,  in  principle,  any  turbulent  flow.  For

some idealized cases it can be simplified and solved without particular difficulties.

III. 1D STATIONARY TURBULENT FLOW IN CHANNEL AND PIPE

Begin  our  analysis  with  the  simplest  1D  case:  turbulent  stationary  flow  in  a
plane—parallel  channel.  We  use  the  Cartesian  coordinates 
,  with  origin  in  the
middle  of  channel.  Assume  that  flow  goes  in  z -direction,  the  height  of  channel  in  x -
direction is  2a  and the channel is infinite in  y -direction. Since flow in such a channel is
symmetric relative to  x = 0  plane,  we  will  further  analyze  the  velocity  distribution  only
for 0 £

£x a .
For  this  stationary  steady  flow  the  first  term  in  (4)  is  equal  to  zero,  and  the
  and  mean  pressure  P   do  not  depend  on  z -

regular laminar flow in a channel.

Note  that  coefficients  A  and  B  in  [12]  determine  the  magnitude  of  convective
acceleration  terms.  The  right-hand  side  terms  in  (12)  describe  the  “substantial”
acceleration of fluid (or gas) particle that appears due to “specific”  velocity and pressure
distributions inside the turbulent flow.

Now  we  analyze  the  second  simplest  case:  a  turbulent  stationary  axi-symmetric
flow  in  circular  pipe  with  radius  R.  All  the  simplifications  used  above  for  channel  are
valid now. Applying them to equation (3) written in the cylindrical coordinates  (
)
for  axi-symmetric  case,  we  obtain  the  equation  describing  mean  velocity  distribution

Unlike (12), equation (13) contains one additional term in the left-hand side due

to differentiation in cylindrical coordinates.

Equations  (12)  and  (13)  can  be  solved  only  numerically.  To  do  this  we  should
know  coefficients  A  and  B,  and  centerline  velocity  Vcl .  These  quantities  can  be
determined  by  specifying  some  characteristics  of  a  turbulent  flow  and  the  boundary
conditions:  zero  velocity  at  the  wall,  derivative  at  the  wall  and  zero  derivative  at  the
center [5].

To specify a stationary fully developed turbulent 1D flow in channel or pipe we
will  use  two  parameters  that  can  be  measured  without  a  difficulty:  the  bulk  (average)

velocity V b  of flow and the pressure gradient (drop) 

 in axial direction. Besides this,

one should, of course, know the kinematic viscosity  n  and density  r   of  fluid  (or  gas)
used, and channel half-height  a  or pipe radius  R .

Note,  that  in  order  to  describe  any  laminar  flow  we  need  to  specify  only  one

measured parameter, because the quantities  V b , Vcl  and 

 for a laminar flow are not

independent. For channel or pipe they are connected by the following formulas  [1, 6, 7]:

1.2Vb),  we  solved  equations  (12)  or  (13)  changing  the  value  of  coefficient  B  until  the

After that we calculated the bulk velocity by formula (16) and compared it with
the  experimental  value.  If  this  experimental  result  was  greater  (less)  than  the  computed
one,  we  increased  (decreased)  the  magnitude  of  coefficient  A  and  repeated  the
calculations  described  above.  This  procedure  has  been  done  a  few  times  until  the
obtained  theoretical  value  Vb  coincides  with  the  experimental  data.  Such  a  process  is  a
converging one, and it usually takes only a few steps to achieve the match.

Then, using the calculated mean velocity profile (

 for a channel or

few steps.

In  general  we  compared  almost  forty  different  experimental  velocity  profiles
taken  from  [3,  8-19],  with  our  computations.  Everywhere  we  obtained  good  agreement
between our theoretical distributions and experimental data. Some examples for channels
and pipes, for various fluids and gases with different Re are given in Figs. 1-10. As one
can see, our calculations match perfectly well with the measurement results. It means that
expression  (8)  for  the  Reynolds  stress  is  really  correct,  i.e.  we  have  found  the  right
formula  connecting  this  stress  and  mean  flow  velocity.  In  Table  1  we  represented  the
main  parameters  of  flows  under  consideration  and  calculated  values  of  different
coefficients.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

Mean velocity distributions for turbulent flows can be approximately described by
equations (4), (5), (8). This approach is based on relation (8) between the Reynolds stress
and mean velocity components in a turbulent flow.

Computation  results  for  two  simplest  1D  stationary  fully  developed  turbulent
flows in a circular pipe and a plane-parallel channel, based on equations (12), (13), match
perfectly  well  with  experimental  data  for  the  mean  velocity  and  Reynolds  stress
distributions.

The  agreement  between  theoretical  and  experimental  results  confirms  the

correctness of our approach and computation accuracy.

Abstract 

In this series of papers, an analytical theory for the early stage of hurricane development is 

proposed.  In  Part  I,  linear  and  non-linear  theories  have  been  formulated,  based  on  an 

assumption  of  the  existence  of  a  positive  feedback  of  a  self-induced  developing  system.  It 

was  found  in  Part  I  that  the  linear  theory,  a  kind  of  the  2D  Rankine  vortex,  gives  some 

unacceptable  analytical  solutions  of  hurricane  development  at  the  upper  half  of  the 

atmosphere,  although  these  solutions  are  fairly  reasonable  at  the  lower  atmosphere.  In  the 

non-linear theory, the analytical solutions agree well in many respects with observations of 

hurricane development at the early stage. Particularly, the solutions of the non-linear theory 

offer some new insights, which cannot be obtained by the linear theory, such as the very fast 

increase of tangential wind near the core region, the deep U-shape of geopotential penetrating 

nearly  up  to  the  tropopause,  the  cyclonic  wind  at  the  upper  atmosphere  where  divergence 

occurs. However, this non-linear has a disturbing property: a discontinuity of tangential wind 

and geopotential with radius as hurricanes develop.  In  this  paper,  this discontinuity will be 

resolved  satisfactorily  without  any  significant  influence  on  the  results  obtained  in  the 

nonlinear theory in Part I. In addition, the effect of friction will be also investigated in this 

paper, which has not been done in Part I so far.

1. Introduction 

A  completely  analytical  theory  for  hurricane  phenomenon,  so  far,  has  not  been 

developed.  Traditional  theoretical  approaches  usually  utilized  some  scaling  numbers  or 

incipient  balanced  relationships  to  study  the  hurricane  development.  For  example,  Sawyer 

(1947) and Yanai (1961) proposed an interesting theoretical idea for hurricane development, 

in which some initial equilibrium relationships between mass and wind fields were exploited 

(Palmen and Newton 1969, chapter 15). If this equilibrium is disturbed, tangential and radial 

wind will ensue. By following this route, Yanai has obtained a final equation which contains 

several stability coefficients. Because these coefficients have no explicit expression, no exact 

solution was obtained thus far. In another fashion, Willoughby (1979) has made use of some 

scaling  values,  e.g.  tangential  wind  V=50m/s,  radial  wind  U=10m/s,  etc.,  and  expanded  all 

field  variables  as  a  series  in  terms  of  a  nondimension  number  ε  (ε  ≡U/V).  By  performing 

some scaling and restricting the series to the first two approximations, a system of equations 

for  mean  fields  and  another  system  for  perturbations  emerged.  This  theoretical  idea  has 

employed implicitly a pre-existing hurricane and it was also impossible to find any analytical 

solutions with this theory because of the high order and mixed derivatives of field variables. 

Another  example  is  the  work  of  Montgomery  and  Farrell  (1993)  on  tropical  cyclone 

formation. In their work, a separation between geostrophic wind (vg) and ageostrophic winds 

(ua,w)  was  made  to  concentrate  on  the  secondary  circulation  by  ageostrophic  winds.  Some 

conclusions  of  the  role  of  the  upper  level  potential  vorticity  on  the  formation  process  of 

tropical  cyclone  were  obtained  but,  once  again,  it  is  still  impossible  to  come  up  with  any 

exact  solutions  in  their  work.    In  recent  decades,  the  most  extensive  approach  to  hurricane 

problem is modeling, due to the rapid improvement of computer speed (Zhang et. al. 2000; 

Challa  et.  al.  1998;  Nguyen  et.  al.  2001;  Zhu  et.  al.  2001;  to  name  only  a  few).  By  using 

 

4

hurricane models, it is automatically impossible to find any information about the functional 

form of the solutions of the system of the primitive equations.  

In Part I of this series of papers, two theories for the early stage of the development of 

hurricanes have been considered. One is a linear theory and the other is non-linear. In order 

to handle the problem analytically, it has been assumed that there exists a positive feedback 

process between latent heat and vertical motion in some region when (and where) a hurricane 

is  expected  to  form.  In  the  linear  theory,  all  nonlinear  terms  are  neglected  and  no  friction 

included.  The  analytical  solutions  obtained  from  this  theory  have  several  fairly  reasonable 

properties,  which  agree  with  observations  at  the  lower  half  of  the  atmosphere,  such  as  the 

correct variation of tangential wind with radius, the cyclonic sense of wind, the U-shape of 

geopotential  (but  shallower  than  observations  (fig.2b  and  fig.  3  in  Part  I)),  the  increase  of 

tangential  and  radial  winds  with  time  (which  tell  us  about  the  growing  of  hurricanes  as 

expected).  These  solutions  are  somewhat  the  same  as  for  the  2D  Rankine  vortex  in  fluid 

mechanics.  However,  at  the  upper  half  of  the  atmosphere,  this  linear  theory  immediately 

gives us some unobserved behaviors: motion will be anti-cyclonic, a high pressure system (a 

hill-shape of geopotential) will develop.  

To surmount these shortcomings of the linear theory, a nonlinear theory is considered 

(but it still has no friction included). This non-linear theory captures all the good points in the 

linear  theory  mentioned  above  (as  it  must).  In  addition,  this  theory  offers  some  new 

properties.  First,  the  tangential  wind  in  the  region  where  the  positive  feedback  is  effective 

will no longer increase as an exponential of time. Instead, it increases much stronger, as an 

exponential  function  of  exponential  of  time  (exp(ekt)),  which  is  much  faster  than  the  radial 

wind  or  the  tangential  wind  outside  this  feedback  region.  This  may  help  us  explain  why 

hurricanes have an eye formed in this region at later time (it does not mean that hurricanes 

 

5

have an eye at the early stage. It just means that hurricanes tend to form an eye). Second, this 

nonlinear  theory  gives  us  a  correct  variation  of  tangential  wind  with  height  as  observed. 

Finally,  this  theory  is  also  able  to  explain  a  potentially  deeper  U-shape  of  geopotential  as 

well  as  the  cyclonic  motion  even  when  there  is  a  divergence  in  the  upper  half  of  the 

atmosphere,  which  was  not  obtained  by  the  linear  theory.  The  weakness  of  this  non-linear 

theory  is  that  tangential  wind  and  geopotential  are  no  longer  a  continuous  function  with 

radius  as  hurricanes  develop.  Another  weakness,  as  in  the  linear  theory,  is  the  endlessly 

increase of solutions with time. This is because, so far, there is no mechanism to control the 

energy released in these theories. Both of these theories are expected to be correct up to first 

6-12h  of  the  growing  of  hurricanes.  Beyond  this  period,  they  will  give  inaccurate 

descriptions.   

The purpose of this paper will consist of: 

1.  Eliminate the discontinuity in the non-linear theory. 

2.  Include the effects of friction to the non-linear theory 

This paper has five sections. Section 2 contains an improvement of the nonlinear theory in 

Part I so that tangential wind and geopotential will vary continuously with radius. Section 3 

presents a nonlinear theory in which friction will be included. So far, this friction has been 

neglected  in  both  theories  in  Part  I.  Section  4  will  mention  some  unresolved  questions. 

Discussions and conclusion will be given in the final section.

2.  A  continuous  nonlinear  theory  for  the  early  stage  of  hurricane 
development 
 

Because  of  the  remarkable  results  obtained  from  the  non-linear  theory  in  Part  I  by 

using  an  assumption  of  a  positive  feedback  process  within  a  region  of  radius  a,  this 

assumption will be made again. According to this assumption, every time hurricanes tend to 

be formed in some region, it is reasonable to assume that there is a proportional relationship 

between latent heat release (J) and vertical motion (w), given by: J=kw. More explanations 

about this proportionality are given in Part I and will not be mentioned here again. However, 

unlike the top-hat function of positive feedback process as in Part I, our purpose now is to 

find a new smooth function for the positive feedback process. Recall that, in Part I, vertical 

motion is assumed to be different from zero within a region of radius a and to be zero outside 

this region. Accordingly, the positive feedback process will vary with radius in the same way 

as  the  vertical  motion.  The  natural  generalization  of  a  top-hat  function  is  the  Gauss-

distribution function. This Gauss function appears frequently in many physical applications 

and  it  seems  to  be  a  good  candidate  for  any  “pulse”  phenomenon.  A  hurricane  can  be 

regarded  as  a  source  point  of  some  meteorological  quantities,  e.g.  temperature  or  vertical 

motion,  in  some  small  scale  region.  These  quantities  then  decrease  very  fast  outward.  The 

successes of the top-hat function of vertical motion in the non-linear theory in Part I suggest 

an attempt of using this Gauss function for the vertical motion to overcome the discontinuity.  

For  the  sake  of  completeness,  all  assumptions  in  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I  are 

rewritten here. More complete explanations can be found in sections 3.1 and 3.2 in Part I. 

-  Non-linear terms in the tangential and radial momentum equations are included, but 

non-linear terms in vertical and thermodynamic equations are neglected.  

-  No friction is considered

-  There exist a region in which vertical velocity (w) is related to heating source (J) by a 

positive feedback relationship (J=kw). Vertical velocity will have a prescribed Gauss

As in Part I, it is reasonable to consider the function W1(r,z) as a separable function of radius 

and height W1(r,z)=H(z)R(r). The reason for this separable function is that vertical motion is 

always equal to zero at both the lower surface and the tropopause. Therefore, the dependence 

of vertical motion with height can be approximated to be the same everywhere. In Part I, the 

function H(z) is chosen as: H(z)=W0sin(λz), where λ is inversely proportional to the standard 

scale height H0 (H0 ≈10km) so that the vertical velocity is equal to zero at z=0 and z=H0 (see 

Part I for the explanations of this choice). Also, as in Part I, W2(r,z) will be neglected. This 

neglecting  means  that  all  vertical  motions  within  the  region  of  radius  a  is  assumed  to 

originate  from  the  positive  feedback  process.  As  mentioned  above,  in  order  to  remove  the 

discontinuity  of  tangential  wind  and  geopotential  with  radius,  it  is  necessary  to  replace  the 

top-hat  function  of  R(r)  in  Part  I  (R(r)  =  0  for  r<a  and  zero  otherwise)  by  the  Gauss-

distribution function: R(r)

It  should  be  remembered  that  there  now  no  longer  have  two  regions  I  and  II  as  in  the 

nonlinear theory in Part I since the top-hat function for R(r) has been replaced by the Gauss 

function. It is therefore unnecessary to solve the system ((1.1) to (1.5)) separately as in Part I.

It is not difficult to check that the radial wind will increase linearly with radius for the small 

radius and will decrease as a function of inverse radius for the large radius. This behavior of 

the radial wind is consistent with that in the nonlinear theory in Part I. This is not surprising 

since Gauss function, in some way, is a smooth function of the top-hat function. Therefore, it 

is necessary for the radial wind to have behaviors consistent with those in Part I as the radius 

approaches the extreme values. The advantage of this Gauss function over top-hat function 

for vertical velocity is now clear: the radial wind is automatically continuous without using 

any continuous condition at the radius r = a as in the nonlinear theory in Part I. It is expected 

that this advantage will be also applied for tangential wind and geoptential. Substitute (1.6) 

and (1.9) into (1.2) to obtain an equation for tangential wind:

exactly.  From  the  results  in  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I,  we  know  that  both  radial  and 

tangential  wind  have  the  same  dependence  on  radius.  Therefore,  it  is  suggestive  to  seek  a 

solution for the tangential wind in the same form as the radial wind solution (1.9) (Because 

the Gauss-distribution function is a kind of generalization of the top-hat function).  We thus 

find the solution of tangential wind in the form:

Where  the  function  g(r,z,t)  is  still  a  function  of  r.  At  the  large  and  small  radius,  g(r,z,t)  is 

expected to be a function of (z,t) only so that solution (1.11) will have the same asymptotic 

forms as those in the non-linear theory in Part I. If this is the case, it is easy to verify that the 

tangential wind will have the correct expressions as in Part I when the radius approaches the 

very large and small values: tangential wind will increase linearly with radius for the small 

value  of  r  and  decrease  as  a  function  of  inverse  radius  for  the  large  value  of  r.  Substitute 

(1.11) into (1.10), with the attention that:

This  solution  should  be  compared  with  the  solution  (2.33)  in  Part  I.  Apparently,  both 

solutions at the large radius are completely the same, which assures that all of the results in 

the nonlinear theory in Part I can be applied equally well at the large radius. We expect this 

consistency  because  the  solutions  obtained  in  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I  have  been 

verified with observations. Therefore, any modification in this section, at first, must preserve 

all the good points that the nonlinear theory in Part I has obtained and the solution (1.17) is 

perfectly what we are looking for at the large radius.

is  indeed  a  particular  solution  of  (1.19).  This  once  again  tells  us  that,  at  the  small  radius, 

equation (1.14) admits a solution which agrees with that in the nonlinear theory in Part I. In 

order to complete the treatment of the problem, it would be great if equation (1.14) can be 

solved  for  all  intermediate  values  of  radius,  admitting  the  solutions  (1.17)  and  (1.20)  as 

boundary conditions. However, it is very hard and, fortunately, not very necessary to do that 

task. Recall that our purpose here is to find a modification such that all conclusions obtained 

in the nonlinear theory in Part I can be still valid while the discontinuity of tangential wind 

and  geopotential  with  radius  at  the  later  time  is  removed.  Obviously,  this  purpose  is  done. 

Although it is not possible to obtain any explicit solution at all values of radius for tangential 

wind  (and  consequently,  geopotential),  basically  we  have  shown  a  way  to  get  rid  of  the 

discontinuity. This is very important because, from now on, it is sufficient to use the top-hat 

function  for  vertical  velocity  to  examine  the  properties  of  analytical  solutions  without  any 

worry  about  the  possible  disturbing  discontinuities.  The  reason  why  the  top-hat  function  is 

preferred is because exact solutions can be found the most easily in this case. Whenever it is 

required to remove discontinuities, all we need to do is to replace the top-hat function by the 

Gauss-distribution  function  and  all  conclusions  are  still  preserved.    It  should  be  noted  that 

equation (1.14) will contain many other possible solutions. However, by using the solutions 

(1.17) and (1.20) as boundary limitations, which are physically meaningful at the large and 

small radiuses, the continuous physical solution of (1.14) will be unique.

3. A nonlinear theory with friction included 

All  the  theories  for  the  early  stage  of  hurricanes  developed  so  far  in  this  series  of 

papers have no friction included. Actually, as explained in part I, the role of friction becomes 

much less significant in all of the above theories due to the assumption of the existence of a 

positive  feedback  between  latent  heat  release  and  vertical  motion.  Usually,  in  a  real 

atmosphere, friction is believed to be the main mechanism for the convergence at low level. 

This convergence is very important since it provides a source of latent heat for hurricanes. 

The no-friction assumption may lead to some confusing and the role of friction, therefore, is 

deserved to be discussed in more detail before we delve into this section.  

Normally,  the  discussions  of  friction  and  convergence  are  mentioned  together  (and 

blended  into  one  another).  The  common  thinking  about  the  effect  of  friction  in  hurricane 

development  is  as  follows:  Friction  will  slow  down  tangential  wind  and  annihilate  the 

balanced  tangential  wind.  So,  there  will  appear  an  inward  component  of  radial  wind  and, 

because of the conservation of angular momentum (this is not really true due to the presence 

of  friction),  the  inward  wind  will  lead  to  a  strong  increase  of  tangential  wind.  Also,  the 

convergence toward low center will create an upward motion and provide more moisture to 

the upper levels. These arguments have an origin from the Ekman convergence problem (e.g. 

Holton  1993).  Therefore,  an  assumption  of  no  friction  may  lead  to  a  quick  conclusion  that 

there  is  no  convergence  and  hurricanes  cannot  exist.  However,  it  turns  out  that  the  always 

side-by-side appearance of friction and convergence conceals another kind of convergence. It 

is convenient to divide the convergence in hurricanes imaginarily into two kinds. The first is 

the  friction  convergence  mentioned  above.  The  second  kind  of  convergence  is  related  to  a 

positive  feedback  process  between  vertical  motion  and  latent  heat  and  has  no  relation  to 

friction.  The  meaning  of  this  feedback  convergence  is  as  follows:  Suppose  now  that  a 

 

14

positive  feedback  is  triggered  at  the  middle  level  of  the  atmosphere,  then  both  temperature 

and vertical velocity will increase at this level. Because of the impenetrable surface boundary 

and the stable troposphere, the vertical velocity will be forced to be zero at the surface and 

tropopause.  Since  vertical  velocity  is  a  continuous  function  of  height,  there  will  have  a 

convergence  of  wind  below  (vertical  velocity  increases  with  height)  and  divergence  above 

(vertical  velocity  decreases  with  height).  This  strong  convergence  (divergence)  leads  to  a 

larger inward (outward) acceleration of radial wind below (above) and so on. An equivalent 

view is that a warm core in the feedback region will lead to an expanding column and will 

lower the surface pressure. A low pressure system will develop and more convergence will 

occur. Friction plays no role in this feedback process. 

In all of the theories for the early stage of hurricane development so far, much of the 

concentration  is  on  the  convergence  due  to  the  positive  feedback  process.  Friction 

convergence has been totally neglected. Basically, these theories support the development of 

hurricanes in which the role of friction is minor. No friction does not mean that there is no 

convergence.  If  there  is  no  feedback  mechanism,  friction  alone  will  spin  down  a  vortex 

instead of strengthening it. When a positive feedback appears, the roles of this feedback in 

controlling  the  convergence  will  dominate  those  of  friction.  Hurricanes,  as  a  whole,  are 

governed  by  the  convergence  from  the  feedback  process  rather  than  by  the  friction 

convergence.  To  investigate  the  role  of  friction,  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I  will  be 

expanded in this section in which friction will be included. It should be careful that all of the 

variables in the system of the primitive equations are not averaged in any way and, therefore, 

there is no room for the concept of eddy flux terms in any discussion here (see Part I for the 

detailed explanations of the role of eddy terms in the primitive equations).  

 

15

Because it is now known from section 2 that the assumption of the top-hat function 

for  the  vertical  velocity  is  not  a  serious  shortcoming  (though  this  function  will  lead  to  a 

discontinuity of tangential wind and geopotential), we will use again this top-hat function for 

vertical  motion  so  that  the  exact  solutions  of  the  system  of  the  primitive  equations  can  be 

found the most easily. Any discontinuity will be eliminated simply by replacing the top-hat 

function by the Gauss-distribution function and every conclusions obtained in this section are 

still  valid.  All  of  the  starting  assumptions  in  this  section  will  be  the  same  as  those  in  the 

nonlinear theory in Part I. However, the no-friction assumption, which has been used in Part 

I,  will  now  be  removed.  Rewrite  the  starting  system  of  the  primitive  equations  in  the

Here we have introduced terms κ∂2u/∂z2 and κ∂2v/∂z2 to represent frictional effects. Note that 

these friction terms represent only the molecular viscosity because all field variables (u, v, w, 

etc.)  are  not  subject  to  the  Reynolds  average  and,  therefore,  no  eddy  concept  will  appear. 

Following  exactly  what  have  been  done  in  Part  I,  the  solutions  for  the  vertical  and  radial 

velocity in regions I and II will be given by:

(2.13) 

The problem now becomes much more complicated because of the appearance of the friction 

terms,  although  this  term  is  very  small  (molecular  viscosity  coefficient  κ  is  usually  very 

small). There no longer exists solutions of the form Fh=Cexp(eβt) as in the no-friction theory 

in Part I. Indeed, it is not hard to prove that, if κ is a constant, the only separable solution that 

we can get from (2.13) will have a form: 

F
h

=

D

sin(

κλλ −
ez
)

2

t

, which will decrease with time 

and  it  is  not  the  solution  that  we  are  expecting  for  a  developing  system.  The  expected 

solution of (2.13) must be not only a growing solution abut also a continuous function of κ 

such that, when the viscosity coefficient is equal to zero, this solution needs to approach the 

solution obtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I. Equation (2.13) illustrates very 

clearly  how  much  a  small  quantity  when  added  can  effect  to  the  final  exact  solution. 

Normally, the scaling evaluation is used and one simply ignores a small molecular frictional 

term. This small term may have a small effect to the numerical calculation but it can change 

substantially  the  functional  form  of  the  exact  solution.  Sometimes,  this  small  adding  term 

will  create  a  bifurcation  point  and  exact  solutions  may  behave  totally  different. 

Consequently,  the  values  obtained  from  numerical  calculation  needs  to  have  a  very  special 

attention. 

However,  if  all  field  variables  are  not  Reynolds  averaged  as  stated  above,  this 

viscosity coefficient κ will be very small and it represents just a molecular friction. In order 

 

18

to have a more meaningful effect of friction, it is necessary to apply the Reynolds-averaging 

operator to transform the true variables to Reynolds-averaged variables so that friction will 

represent eddy processes. The system of the primitive equations does not change under this 

averaging process except there appear some eddy terms (see e.g. Holton 1993, chapter 5). We 

will  always  understand  that  if  friction  terms  represent  eddy  processes,  all  variables  are 

Reynolds  averaged.  In  this  case,  the  appearance  of  eddy  processes  will  make  problem 

become extremely complicated since it is impossible to know a true parameterization for the 

small-scale processes. For the purpose of theoretically investigating, it is desired to use some 

tentative  functional  forms  for  the  eddy  terms  to  study  the  characteristics  of  the  exact 

solutions.  Consider  now  the  case  in  which  the  eddy  coefficient  κ  is  a  function  of  time  as 

follows:  κ=κ0exp(βt).  The  motivation  for  this  choice  comes  from  the  observations  and 

previous  works  that  the  eddy  coefficient  is  a  function  of  wind  speed.  If  a  hurricane  is 

growing,  wind  speed  will  increase  with  time  and,  therefore,  this  eddy  coefficient  κ  will 

depend on time. This time dependence may be not the actual case but, at least, it provides us 

some insights into the effect of friction and makes problem solvable. With this assumption, 

(2.13) now becomes:

Once again, (2.16) is not easy to solve but the important point is that we now have G(z) as a 

function  of  z  only  and  totally,  the  explicit  solution  will  depend  on  time  as  an  exponential 

function  of  exponential  of  time.  The  only  change  compared  with  the  case  of  no  friction  in 

Part I is that the vertical profile of wind will be modified. The role of friction in this case is to 

re-arrange  the  dependence  of  tangential  wind  with  height.  The  final  solution  for  tangential 

wind in region I can be written symbolically as

This is not the final solution for (2.21) yet because we have to consider one more thing: the 

homogeneous solutions of equation (2.21). It is easy now to find that there are an infinitive 

number of homogeneous solutions. These homogeneous solutions can be divided into three 

families,  based  on  their  time  dependence:  a  family  of  time-decreasing  solutions,  a  constant 

value and a family of time-increasing solutions. The final homogeneous solution requires a 

superposition of all of these families. This superposition leads to an infinitive solution, which 

 

21

is not acceptable for realistic cases. To get rid of this difficulty, we need to use a condition 

which has not been used before: a continuous dependence of the solution of equation (2.21) 

on κ. It means that when κ approaches zero, the solution of (2.21) must be identical with that 

obtained  in  the  no-friction  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I  (solution  with  κ=0).  Using  this 

condition, the only acceptable homogeneous solution of (2.21) is a constant value. Therefore, 

the final solution for the tangential wind in the region II is:

(2.25) 

Compare this solution with (2.33) in the nonlinear theory in Part I, it is immediate to realize 

that if κ is equal to zero, the solution for the tangential wind in region II given by (2.25) is 

consistent with that obtained from the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I. For the case in 

which  κ   is  a  constant,  friction  will  represent  the  molecular  viscosity  only  and  κ  is  very 

small . Therefore, the difference between solution (2.25) and the solution obtained in Part I 

will be insignificant. 

The effect of friction is the most effective only if the Reynolds-averaged variables are 

considered  as  mentioned  in  few  paragraphs  above.  Consider  now  a  situation  in  which  the 

eddy coefficient κ will change with time as: κ=κ0exp(βt) as investigated in region I. In this 

case, it is not difficult to realize that the solution of (2.21) will have a form: G=T(t)cos(λz). 

Substitute this solution into (2.21) we have:

where ζ is a constant of integration. A quick inspection will show that, if κ0 is equal to zero, 

(2.29) is indeed consistent with solution (2.33) in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I. 

Once  again,  we  found  that  the  tangential  wind  in  region  II  increases  approximately  as  an 

exponential  function  of  time,  which  is  much  slower  than  tangential  wind  in  region  I  (Note 

that there is a substantial cancellation of time-dependent terms in (2.29)). This result is also 

obtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I.  

The final task of finding geopotential for each region is nothing special and will not 

be  mentioned  here.  The  appearance  of  the  friction  terms  does  not  change  much  the 

conclusions about geopotential obtained in Part I except some minor modifications, e.g. the 

solution for geopotential in region I now becomes:

all variables are Reynolds-averaged and eddy coefficient κ is given by κ=κ0exp(βt)). It is not 

possible  to  have  an  exact  solution  the  analytical  solution  of  tangential  wind  in  region  I 

because function G(z) is unknown. However, it is reasonable to have all conclusions about 

the behaviors of geopotential in region I as obtained so far in Part I. This is because friction 

contributes only: 1) a term which increases as an exponential function of time (the last term 

inside the bracket in the RHS of (2.30)), which increase much slower than the K-terms and 2) 

changing the functional form of height dependence (the unknown function G(z)). Therefore, 

the K-terms in the RHS of (2.30) are still an exponential function of exponential of time and 

will be the dominated terms at later time. The conclusions for the geopotential field in region 

II obtained in the no-friction nonlinear theory in Part I are also valid here.

4. Unresolved problems 

At this point, it can be easily seen that all the theories developed so far in Part I and II 

still have a very disturbing result: a nonstop growing of all variables. This is because we have 

used  a  positive  feedback  which  is  completely  independent  on  any  internal  mechanism.  A 

question  is  “What  prevent  a  hurricane  from  growing  endlessly  while  it  has  an  unlimited 

source  of  moisture  at  the  ocean  surface?”  Several  reasons  can  be  listed,  such  as  the  latent 

heat release will raise the temperature of environment in (the)region I so that the buoyancy 

forcing will reach an asymptotic value instead of increasing exponentially with time (β2 is a 

function of time, not a constant as assumed so far), the nonlinear dependence of friction on 

wind speed (which makes friction become important at later time and the energy lost due to 

friction  can  not  be  simply  neglected).  Until  now,  none  of  these  damping  effects  was 

considered. The results in this work, as mentioned in Part I, should be confined to the first 6-

12 hours of hurricane lifetime. Beyond this period, all solutions will be inaccurate.  

In section 3, there are some investigations into the role of friction at the early stage of 

hurricane  development,  which  was  ignored  in  Part  I.  It  was  commented  that  there  are 

basically two kinds of convergence: one is due to friction and the other is due to a feedback 

process between latent heat release and vertical motion. According to the theories developed 

so far in Part I and II, the role of the feedback process in controlling the convergence is so 

influent  that  friction,  when  included,  does  not  change  significantly  all  the  conclusions 

obtained in the no-friction theory in Part I as seen in section 3. It is worthy now to have some 

more  explanations  about  this  separation  between  two  kinds  of  convergence.  In  an  axis-

symmetric  hurricane,  the  variation  of  tangential  wind  with  the  azimuthal  angle,  ∂v/∂λ,  is 

always assured to be zero and all of the convergence/divergence will be decided only by the 

vertical and radial motions. In the presence of friction, tangential wind will be slowed down 

 

25

(but  the  axis-symmetry  still  guarantees  that  ∂v/∂λ=0)  and  there  will  appear  an  inward 

acceleration  of  radial  wind.  This  acceleration  creates  a  convergence  at  low  level  and, 

consequently,  vertical  motion  will  follow.  In  a  typical  atmosphere,  such  friction-induced 

secondary  circulation  will  spin  down  a  vortex  (Holton,  1993).  However,  in  hurricane 

conditions,  such  a  circulation  may  create  an  unknown  feedback  and,  so  far,  this  friction 

feedback  has  not  been  included.  Note  that  this  friction  feedback  is  different  from  the 

feedback employed in this series of papers, which is a relationship between vertical motion 

and  latent  heat.  There  appears  now  a  difficult  question:  “how  can  we  distinguish  between 

these feedbacks clearly”. Actually, this work has answered partly this question by pointed out 

that, under only the assumption of the feedback between latent heat and vertical motion, the 

dynamical properties of hurricanes have been captured well. This fact shows implicitly that 

the  feedback  between  vertical  motion  and  latent  heat  is  dominant.  It  should  be  mentioned 

that, though friction was included in section 3, the feedback is still between latent heat and 

vertical motion only and the role of friction feedback is still open. 

As  in  Part  I,  nothing  is  mentioned  about  the  eye  of  hurricanes  because  all  of  our 

concentration is just on the early stage of hurricane development. However, with the explicit 

solutions  obtained  in  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I  and  this  paper,  we  can  say  something 

about  the  appearance  of  an  eye  of  a  hurricane.  It  is  possible  to  imagine  this  eye-forming 

process of a hurricane as follows: When a positive feedback is effective within some region, 

vertical  wind  will  increase  as  an  exponential  function  of  time  in  this  region.  This  strong 

vertical  motion,  or  equivalently  the  strong  vertical  advection,  will  generate  a  large  source 

term in the tangential wind equation. As a consequent, the tangential wind in this region will 

increase very fast with time and create a parabolic shape of geopotential (in the same way as 

we stir robustly a water surface in a glass). Here, we have a situation: wind field decides the 

 

26

shape  of  geopotential  rather  than  inversely.  (This  is  reasonable  since,  at  small  scale,  the 

atmosphere  tends  to  have  mass  field  adjusted  to  wind  field  rather  than  inversely).  As  time 

passes, this geopotential surface is lower and lower and an eye tends to form at later time. 

However,  this  picture  is  still  far  from  observations  since  vertical  velocity,  according  to  the 

theories  in  Part  I  and  II,  increases  exponentially  everywhere  inside  region  I,  which  is  not 

realistic  as  observed.  However,  at  least,  the  theories  developed  in  Part  I  and  this  paper 

provide a good picture of hurricane dynamics at the early stage of hurricane lifetime.

5. Discussion and conclusion  

In this second part, my first purpose is to remove the discontinuity of the tangential 

wind  and  geopotential  with  radius,  which  appears  in  the  analytical  solutions  for  the  early 

developing stage of a hurricane obtained in the non-linear theory in Part I. By replacing the 

top-hat function by the Gauss-distribution function for vertical velocity, it is then found that 

the discontinuity has been eliminated satisfactorily without changing all conclusions obtained 

in  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I.  Although  it  has  not  been  possible  to  find  all  solutions 

completely explicitly in the case of using the Gauss-distribution function, this improvement 

is  helpful  because  it  allows  us  to  continue  using  the  top-hat  function  for  vertical  velocity 

without any worry about the appearance of discontinuity. The reason we need to use the top-

hat function for investigation is because this is the case in which the analytical solutions of 

the primitive equations can be found the most easily.  

In  section  3,  the  influences  of  friction  were  taken  into  account,  which  has  been 

neglected  in  the  nonlinear  theory  in  Part  I.  If  the  primitive  equations  are  not  subject  to 

Reynolds-averaging  process,  then  these  frictional  effects  represent  just  the  molecular 

viscosity  and,  therefore,  they  are  of  no  interest  to  us.  In  order  to  have  a  more  significant 

meaning  of  the  influence  of  friction,  all  variables  are  then  Reynolds  averaged  so  that  the 

frictional  terms  will  contain  eddy  processes.  In  this  case,  it  was  found  that  all  conclusions 

obtained in the no-friction theory in Part I are still valid. The influences of friction are thus 

minor.  

It  is  perhaps  surprising  that,  by  assuming  just  a  positive  feedback  between  vertical 

motion  and  latent  heat,  it  is  then  possible  to  find  all  solutions  of  the  system  of  primitive 

equations  explicitly  as  seen  in  Part  I  and  II.  As  pointed  out  in  Part  I,  this  is  because  the 

system of the primitive equations has been divided into two closed subsystems: one for radial 

 

28

and  vertical  velocities  and  the  other  for  tangential  wind  and  geopotential.  Under  the 

assumption of feedback process, it is then easy to obtain the explicit expression for vertical 

motion  with  time.  Using  the  continuity  equation,  we  then  found  radial  wind  and  then 

tangential  wind  and  finally  geopotential.  A  little  scrutiny  will  show  that,  in  this  process  of 

finding solutions, the role of the feedback process is only apparent in determining the time 

dependence  of  vertical  motion.  If  suppose  now  that,  by  some  way,  we  have  an  explicit 

expression for time dependence of the vertical motion, then it is completely unnecessary to 

employ the feedback assumption and we are still able to have all solutions obtained so far. 

There  are  two  properties  that  make  the  primitive  system  becomes  particularly  solvable  for 

hurricane phenomenon. The first property is the existence of the impenetrable surface and the 

tropopause. These boundaries specify an initial prescribed functional form for vertical motion 

such that the vertical velocity must be zero at these boundaries, regardless of type of motion. 

Several functional forms for the dependence of the vertical velocity on height can be used but 

the  final  results  would  not  be  changed  much  because  the  primitive  equations  are  the  first-

order partial differential equations. These boundaries will give us an explicit function for the 

height-dependent  part  of  the  vertical  velocity  in  any  situation.  The  second  property  is  the 

axis-symmetry  of  hurricanes.  These  two  properties  make  the  system  of  the  primitive 

equations become immediately analytically solvable when vertical velocity (or radial wind) 

is known a priori. It is possible to obtain all analytical solutions of the system of the primitive 

equations by applying only the two above properties without any aiding from the feedback 

assumption.  To  see  this  point  clearly,  let  us  consider  the  following  arguments,  which  are 

based entirely on these two above properties and also give us all solutions as in Part I and II:  

 

29

•  For  the  problem  of  investigating  an  initial  stage  of  hurricane  development,  vertical 

velocity  is  expected  to  be  an  increasing  function  of  time.  So,  we  can  write 

w=T(t)Z(z)R(r), where T(t) is an increasing function of time, assumed to be T(t)= eβt 

•  Because of the impenetrable boundaries, the functional form of Z can be chosen to be 

Z=sin(λz)  

•  Assume  the  vertical  motion  is  large  within  a  region  of  radius  r=a  and  small  outside, 

then we can choose: R(r)=

e

(or top-hat function)

The reason why a separable function for the vertical motion is chosen is because the height-

dependence  of  vertical  velocity  can  be  regarded  as  the  same  everywhere  (due  to  the  first-

order derivative of the system of the primitive equations). With these three simple arguments, 

we have showed that, basically, it is possible to have an initialization for the development of 

a  vortex  without  any  aid  from  the  feedback  assumption.  Follow  completely  the  same  as  in 

Part I, all the dynamical characteristics of hurricane development can be recovered. This is a 

remarkably simple route to find exact solutions for the primitive equations. This route is of 

course  arbitrary  but  its  simplicity  is  very  amazing.  If  one  attempts  to  find  first  tangential 

wind  or  geopotential  and  next  vertical  and  radial  wind,  it  will  become  a  nearly  impossible 

task.  

There now appear questions, such as: What is the meaning of the order of solving a 

system  of  equations?  Can  this  order  represent  the  true  evolution  of  a  hurricane  or  it  just  a 

mathematical  trick?  This  question  is  actually  not  trivial.  In  the  experiment  with  a  water 

surface, it is seen clearly that the pattern of the water surface is decided by the velocity field, 

(which is given by an equation: ∂p/∂r = v2/r). But in a synoptic motion, this order is inverted 

as v2/r = ∂p/∂r (note the order of writing this equation) and the meaning, obviously, is also 

 

30

different: the velocity field will be decided by the pressure field. The different way to solve a 

system of equations tells us a different process in nature.

Quantum Harmonic Analysis
and Geometric Invariants∗

Arthur Jaﬀe
Harvard University

September 1997

Abstract

We develop two topics in parallel and show their inter-relation. The ﬁrst centers on the
notion of a fractional-diﬀerentiable structure on a commutative or a non-commutative space.
We call this study quantum harmonic analysis. The second concerns homotopy invariants for
these spaces and is an aspect of non-commutative geometry.

We study an algebra A, which will be a Banach algebra with unit, represented as an algebra
. In order to obtain a geometric interpretation of A, we deﬁne
of operators on a Hilbert space
a derivative on elements of A. We do this in a Hilbert space context, taking da as a commutator
da = [Q, a]. Here Q is a basic self-adjoint operator with discrete spectrum, increasing suﬃciently
rapidly that exp(

βQ2) has a trace whenever β > 0.
We can deﬁne fractional diﬀerentiability of order µ, with 0 < µ

1, by the boundedness
of (Q2 + I)µ/2a(Q2 + I)−
µ/2. Alternatively we can require the boundedness of an appropriate
smoothing (Bessel potential) of da. We ﬁnd that it is convenient to assume the boundedness
α/2, where we choose α, β
of (Q2 + I)−
0 such that α + β < 1. We show that
this also ensures a fractional derivative of order µ = 1

of interpolation spaces Jβ,α. Each such space is a Banach algebra of operator, whose elements
β > 0.

We concentrate on subalgebras A of Jβ,α which have certain additional covariance properties
under a group Z2×
U (g). In addition, the derivative
by a unitary representation γ
Q is assumed to be G-invariant. The geometric interpretation ﬂows from the assumption that
elements of A possess an arbitrarily small fractional derivative. We study homotopy invariants
of A in terms of equivariant, entire cyclic cohomology.
In fact, the existence of a fractional
derivative on A allows the construction of the cochain τ JLO, which plays the role of the integral
of diﬀerential forms. We give a simple expression for a homotopy invariant ZQ(a; g), determined

This representation of the pairing is reminiscent of the heat-kernel representation for an
index. In fact this quantity is an invariant, in the following sense. We isolate a simple condition
on a family Q(λ) of diﬀerentiations that yields a continuously-diﬀerentiable family τ JLO(λ) of
cochains. Since ZQ(a; g) need not be an integer, continuity of τ JLO(λ) in λ is insuﬃcient to prove
the constancy of the pairing. However the existence of the derivative leads to the existence of
vanishes for τ a coboundary, and as dτ JLO(λ)/dλ is a coboundary, our
the homotopy. As
condition on Q(λ) ensures that ZQ(λ)(a; g) is independent of λ. Hence it is a homotopy invariant.
The theory of ZQ(a; g) reduces to the study of the Radon transform of sequences of certain
functions. The fractional diﬀerentiability properties of elements of A translate into properties
of the asymptotics of the sequences of Radon transforms. The condition that τ JLO ﬁt into the
framework of entire cyclic cohomology translates to the existence of some fractional derivative
for functions in the algebra under study, and in particular the assumption α + β < 1. Thus the
study of fractionally-diﬀerentiable structures dove-tails naturally with the theory of homotopy
invariants.

In our study of quantum harmonic analysis, we introduce spaces

β, α) of operator-valued
distributions. These spaces are bounded, linear operators between Sobolev spaces. The elements
of the interpolation spaces, the Banach algebras Jβ,α, have derivatives da which belong to the
spaces
β, α). For a certain range of β and α, we extend the theory of the Radon transform
from products of regularized, bounded operators to products of regularized, operator-valued
distributions.

Introduction

We study algebras A of bounded linear transformation on a Hilbert space
. Each algebra describes
the geometry of a space, and we study homotopy invariants of this space. All this ﬁts into Alain
Connes’ formulation of non-commutative geometry [3], as well as extensions of that theory studied
by others. We emphasize here the analytic aspects of this theory, and in doing so we develop the
relation between the details of the analysis and the existence of invariants.

terms of a given, self-adjoint, linear transformation Q = Q∗ on

the spectrum of Q is discrete, and that the eigenvalues increase suﬃciently rapidly that exp(

In other words, (I.3) is the assertion that a is a bounded, linear transformation on

Alternatively, because of the fundamental nature of the diﬀerential da, we wish to pose diﬀer-
entiability properties of a in terms of properties of da. The diﬀerentiable case for a becomes the
assumption that da is a densely deﬁned, bounded sesquilinear form on

2Such functionals often arise in a purely mathematical setting: in analysis, in probability theory, or in geometry.
Furthermore, such functionals arise in mathematical physics: in statistical physics, in quantum theory, in quantum
ﬁeld theory, and in string theory. Within each of these ﬁelds, it may be true that one can represent a particular
functional as a well-deﬁned integral over a function space. When this is the case, the functional integral representation
provides a powerful tool in order to prove mathematical properties of the functional in question, as well as a tool to
estimate the functional, or possibly to evaluate it in closed form. In particular, constructive quantum ﬁeld theory
provides many examples of this phenomenon.

This condition will appear in a natural way in the construction that follows; the entire condition will
be just the asymptotics needed to establish convergence of various power series and the existence
of generating functionals that we deﬁne on elements of
. This condition was introduced in [4],
in order to prove the existence of a “normalization” operator. Because we use a diﬀerent complex
of cochains, we do not require normalization, but the entire condition remains a natural analytic
assumption, useful for other reasons.

functionals may be integrals or traces and are called expectations of operators in A. We introduce

of multilinear functionals on A and use them below.

V Fractionally Diﬀerentiable Structures

We use the name quantum harmonic analysis for the study of fractional diﬀerentiability of operator
valued functions. An interpolation space, in the quantum context, is a Banach algebra of operator-
valued functions with fractional derivatives. We distinguish quantum harmonic analysis from “non-
commutative harmonic analysis,” a term used to denote the study of harmonic analysis on non-
commutative groups.

case would satisfy

Related to such classes are functions with fractional derivatives of order α. The derivative da of

The norm (V.6) provides a natural measure of functions with derivatives of order α, or of functions

studied.

V.4 Operator-Valued Generalized Functions

We formulate here the natural deﬁnition of a generalized function in the non-commutative case,
which reduces to a distribution in the classical case. A generalized function, or operator valued
Hp(Q) for diﬀerent
Hp =
distribution, is a bounded, linear transformation between two spaces
values of p. We consider a bounded linear transformation x with domain
Hp1 and range contained
0, then x is a bounded linear transformation on
Hp2. If p1 = 0 and p2 ≥
. If p1 > 0 and
in
0 and p2 < 0, then x is a
p2 ≥
with domain
sesquilinear form with domain

0, then x is an unbounded operator on

Dp1. If p1 ≥

VI Cocycles

Throughout this section take A to be a subalgebra of an interpolation space Jβ,α introduced in
V.5.
§
We begin this section by showing the τ JLO extends in this case to be an element of
(A), including
the formula for the pairing with a root of I. We deﬁne deﬁne a fractionally-diﬀerentiable structure.
Finally we show that τ JLO is a cocycle. These facts are preliminary to the next section where we
show that the pairing is actually a homotopy invariant.

(A), and the corresponding coboundary operator ∂, Connes earlier
larger space of cochains
gave another cocycle τ C, see [4]. This cocycle is convenient because it satisﬁes a “normalization”

cocycle in
With τ JLO the cocycle determined by Q, and with τ C the cocycle determined by an appropriate
F = F (Q), Connes has shown [5] (for the diﬀerentiable case) that τ C and τ JLO are cohomologous.
In other words, there is a cochain G

such that τ JLO = τ C + ∂G.

On the other hand, cocycles in

Homotopy Invariants

VII.1 The Main Result: JLO Pairing is Invariant

In this section we consider the pairing of a family τ JLO(λ) of cocycles with a square root a of I.
These cocycles arise from a family of non-commutative, fractionally-diﬀerentiable structures on A.

Matm(AG) rather than to pairing an arbitrary family
The advantage to pairing τ JLO(λ) with a
of cochains τ (λ), is the fact that the pairing function (given in various forms in III.11, 28, 29, and

(VII.2)

We regard Q = Q∗ as deﬁning a basic τ JLO, and q(λ) as providing a deformation of Q and a
perturbation τ JLO(λ) of τ JLO.

Let us state the main result of this section.

An immediate consequence of the fact that dτ JLO(λ)/dλ = ∂h is the invariance of ZQ(a; g). In
particular, continuous diﬀerentiability of τ JLO(λ) ensures, c.f. Proposition III.6, that the pairing

in
a bounded, diﬀerentiable family q(λ) requires work to establish the continuous diﬀerentiability of
τ JLO(λ). The work is not that much greater for the class of regular perturbations which we consider
here and which include a wide variety of interesting examples. Sections VII.2–5 are devoted to a
precise formulation of a regular deformation and to the proof of this theorem. In the literature there
are special cases of this result, for example [10], but there is no general and easily veriﬁable condi-
tions on q(λ), like the one we give here, which result in a homotopy. In fact, the diﬀerentiability of
τ JLO(λ) was never completely analyzed, even for bounded perturbations q(λ).

Deﬁnition VII.7. A family Q(λ) satisfying the Assmptions (a) of

The proof of this proposition parallels that of the Proposition VII.4 and Corollary VII.5. We
µ2a2Q2 + µ2M 2 by (VII.24). Self-adjointness of Q(λ) follows as
just replaced the bound λ2q2
before. Furthermore the three inequalities all ﬂow from the inequality q(λ)2
a2Q2 + M 2. Thus
we end up with the modiﬁed form of (VII.13–15), where a replaces µa and where M replaces µM.
Similarly we can derive the inequalities (VII.22). Thus we also have proved

Each term in these sums has the form

R
X(s; λ′) can be expanded further as a sum of 2n or
of heat kernels. Thus each diﬀerence X(s; λ)
w(n + 1) terms, with exactly one diﬀerence in each. Here this diﬀerence is either the diﬀerence of
a vertex at two values of λ, or else a diﬀerence of heat kernels at two values of λ.

Tr (γU(g)(X(s; λ)

−

For each term, we repeat the uniform bounds as in the proof of Proposition VII.12. These
bounds, however, can be improved through the presence of the diﬀerence, which will ultimately
give a coeﬃcient o(1). If the diﬀerence is a diﬀerence of heat kernels, use the bound of Proposition
IVV.11. Suppose the diﬀerence occurs in the jth heat kernel, counting from zero on the left. This
ǫ
yields a factor o(1), as well as the uniform bound, with the loss of an arbitrarily small power s−

from this one vertex.

Next let us consider terms for which the diﬀerence is a diﬀerence of a vertex. We need to consider

each generic possibility. If the vertex is dλaj the diﬀerence has the form

where δ denotes the diﬀerence quotient for q(λ). The only possible problem arises if δ is adjacent
to a vertex containing ˙q(λ). Each term has at most two vertices with q or ˙q’s. In this case we use
(VII.26) for 0 < ǫ or ǫ < 1. For example, in the term

vertices. These terms are in 1-1 correspondence with the terms in Ln; the diﬀerence quotients for
heat kernels correspond to the dλ ˙q(λ) vertices in Ln(λ) while the diﬀerence quotients for vertices
correspond to the [ ˙q(λ), aj] vertices in Ln. After combining these terms, the estimates of the terms
with vertex diﬀerences proceed as in the proof of part (i). The terms iwth heat kernel diﬀerence
quotients can be treated using the bounds of Propositions VII.10–11. The bounds are similar to
the bounds proved earlier, so we do not give the details.

Equivalence of Parallel, Radon Hyperplanes

transform of the heat kernel regularization X(s) of (n + 1) vertices, evaluated on the hyperplane
β = s0 +

consider a general, parallel, hyperplane deﬁned by β > 0. We deﬁne the corresponding τ JLO,β and

Exchange of Limits

neighborhood of ǫ = λ = 0, see [15]. In these examples we have shown that ZQ(λ) can be recovered
from ZH(ǫ,0). Also we choose the regularizing factor Z ∗Z to be suﬃciently simple so that we can
evaluate ZH(ǫ,0) in closed form. On the other hand, we are interested in knowing ZQ(λ) = ZH(0,λ) for
λ > 0, where it is constant. The important fact is that the function ZH(ǫ,λ) is not jointly continuous

A Q1-Invariant Splitting

We split the self-adjoint operator Q into a sum of self-adjoint operators Q1 and Q2, as in (IX.1).
Each operator Q1, Q2, and Q is odd under γ,

Furthermore, the decomposition (IX.3) of Q2 has the interpretation that Q1 and Q2 generate inde-
pendent translations. Algebraically,

Recall that the Q is assumed to be essentially self-adjoint on the domain
a core for a symmetric operator. The core is invariant if Q
for Q1 and Q2, then products are deﬁned on

is a common, invariant core for Q1, Q2, and Q, such that the bounded functions of Q1 and Q2
commute with the bounded functions of Q2

Part of the deﬁnition that Q splits into a sum of two independent parts, involves the assumption

operators Q1 and Q2

7The notation H and P is suggestive of energy and momentum. In fact, this is no accident, as such examples
arise in space-time supersymmetry. In that case, Q1 and Q2 are generators of symmetries arising from two space-
time directions, and Q2
P , with H and P being the energy and momentum operators.
Combined with the equation for independence of Q1 and Q2, this is called the algebra for space-time supersymmetry

An Example of a Split Structure

We mention here an example which we analyze elsewhere by these methods [16]. The splitting

Thus

we assume the existence of N = 2 supersymmetry. This means that there exist four, pairwise,
mutually-independent self-adjoint operators Q1, Q2, ˜Q1, and ˜Q2 such that for a given H and P ,

We take for the group symmetry G the group U(1)
U(1) constructed in the following manner:
one factor U(1) has the form eiθJ , where the generator J commutes with γ, with H, and with P .
Furthermore J commutes with Q1 and ˜Q1. On the other hand,

where g = (τ, θ). This index was considered in the physics literature [32, 20]. We can justify its
evaluation in a certain class of non-linear quantum ﬁeld theories (Wess–Zumino ﬁeld theory examples
arising form polynomial, quasi-homogeneous superpotentials, which also satisfy an elliptic estimate)
as a product of modular forms [15, 16]. The modular symmetry in (τ, θ) is a hidden symmetry of
the original example.

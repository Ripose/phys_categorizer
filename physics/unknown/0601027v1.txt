We use a rigid axisymetric microfluidic flow focusing device to produce monodisperse bubbles, dispersed 
in a surfactant solution. The gas volume fraction of the dispersion collected out of this device can be as 
large as 90%, demonstrating that foam with solid-like viscoelastic properties can be produced in this way. 
The polydispersity of the bubbles is so low that we observe crystallization of our foam. We measure the 
diameter of the bubbles and compare these data to recent theoretical predictions. The good control over 
bubble  size  and  foam  gas  volume  fraction  shows  that  our  device  is  a  flexible  and  promising  tool  to 
produce calibrated foam at a high flow rate. 
 
 

Foams  are  dispersions  of  bubbles  in  an  aqueous surfactant solution  where  neighbouring  bubbles 

touch  each  other  and  form  a  jammed  solid-like  close  packing(Weaire  and  Hutzler  1999).  Only  if  the 

applied stress exceeds a yield stress, a foam will flow(Höhler and Cohen-Addad 2005). These properties, 

combined  with  the  small  weight  and  large  specific  surface,  give  rise  to  a  large  variety  of 

applications(Khan  and  Prud'homme  1996),  ranging  from  mineral  production  to  the  synthesis  of 

nanoparticles(Bala,  Sankar  et  al.  2005)  and  medical  drug  delivery(Sadick  2005).  There  are  various 

techniques  for  producing  aqueous  foams,  but  most  involve  mixing  of  the  two  phases  in  bulk 

processes(Khan  and  Prud'homme  1996;  Weaire  and  Hutzler  1999).  With  these  methods,  the  rate  of 

production  is  high  so  that  industrial  quantities  can  easily  be  obtained.  However,  little  control  over  the 

formation of individual bubbles is available and their size distribution is broad. Monodisperse foams are 

of  interest  since  they  should  be  particularly  stable.  Indeed,  one  of  the  principal  aging  mechanisms  of 

foam,  known  as  coarsening,  is  driven  by  the  difference  of  Laplace  pressure  between  neighbouring 

bubbles.  This  difference  is  considerably  reduced  if  the  bubbles  are  monodisperse  rather  than 

polydisperse(Ganan-Calvo Alfonso M., Fernandez et al. 2004). Microfluidics, which allows the control of 

liquid flow on microscales, offers a new means to produce complex fluids such as monodisperse foams 

and  emulsions  (Tice,  Song  et  al.  2003;  Okushima,  Nisisako  et  al.  2004;  Atencia  and  Beebe  2005; 

Nisisako, Okushima et al. 2005). In particular, the flow focusing method where two fluids are forced to 

flow  simultaneously  through  a  small  orifice,  is  extremely  efficient  (Ganan-Calvo  and  Gordillo  2001; 

Gordillo, Ganan-Calvo et al. 2001; Anna, Bontoux et al. 2003; Ganan-Calvo 2004; Garstecki, Gitlin et al. 

2004; Gordillo, Cheng et al. 2004; Garstecki, Stone et al. 2005; Utada, Lorenceau et al. 2005). Depending 

on flow rate, there is a jetting or a dripping regime, analogous to what is observed in a dripping faucet 

(Clanet, Searby et al. 1999; Ambravaneswaran, Subramani et al. 2004). In the dripping regime, bubbles 

with  a  polydispersity  index  smaller  than  2%  can  be  obtained(Garstecki,  Gitlin  et  al.  2004).  Still,  the 

usefulness of this technique so far appeared to be limited since in most of the cited studies the maximum 

ratio  of  gas  to  liquid  flow  rates  for  which  the  production  of  monodisperse  drops  or  bubbles  has  been 

reported is only on the order of 0.1. This value is equivalent to a gas volume fraction of 10%, far below 

the fraction of 64% where randomly packed bubbles start touching each other. Only recently, a ratio of 

gas to liquid flow rate larger than one has been reported (Raven, Marmottant et al. 2005), but in this case 

the rate of foam production was very small. This situation motivates the present study of a flow focusing 

device that can yield foam with gas volume fractions up to 90% at a high rate. To gain physical insight 

about the bubble formation, we explore the role of the  coflowing  geometry  and  show  that  a  previously 

proposed  scaling  law  is  valid  up  to  much  larger  gas  to  liquid  flow  rate  ratios  than  reported  before 

(Garstecki, Gitlin et al. 2004; Garstecki, Stone et al. 2005). 

Our microfluidics device is inspired by the three dimensional flow focusing experiment described 

in (Utada, Lorenceau et al. 2005). As sketched in Fig 1A, it is made of a cylindrical glass capillary tube 

fitted  very  closely  into  a  square  glass  capillary  tube  so  that  good  alignment  is  ensured.  The  end  of  the 

inner tube has a constricted shape obtained by melting it with a hot flame. With this method, we obtain 

axisymetric constrictions with diameters b ranging from 50 to 350 µm. However we have a poor control 

over  the  length  of  this  constriction  which  can  vary  independently  of  the  radius.  As  we  will  show,  this 

turns  out  to  be  an  advantage,  since  the  influence  of  the  constriction  volume  Ω  and  diameter  b  can  be 

evidenced  independently.  The  two  immiscible  phases  used  in  our  experiment  are  nitrogen  gas  and  an 

aqueous  solution  containing  a  surfactant  TetradecylTrimethylAmmonium  Bromide  (0.936  % g/g), 
dodecanol (6.24 10-4 % g/g) and glycerol (50 % g/g). All the chemicals were purchased from Aldrich and 

used as received. The concentrations are expressed as the weight of chemicals divided by the total weight 

of  the  solution.  Water  was  purified by using a Millipore Milli-Q filtration system. Using the Wilhelmy 

plate  method,  the  surface  tension  of  the  foaming  solution  was  found  to  be  37.5 ± 0.5 mN/m  at  a 

temperature  of  21°C  and  its  viscosity η  is  5  mPa.s.  As  shown  in  Fig.  1A  the  solution  and  the  gas  are 

injected from the two sides of the square capillary tube and forced to flow through the constriction at the 

entrance  of  the  inner  cylindrical  tube.  Here,  a  dispersion  of  bubbles  is  formed  that  leaves  the  device 

through the cylindrical tube so that it can be collected. The length L of the collection tube is 5 cm and its 

radius R is 400 µm. Using a digitally controlled syringe pump (Kd Scientific) the liquid phase is injected 

into the corners of the square tube at a flow rate denoted as Ql, ranging from 1 to 400 mL/hr. The gas is 

supplied from a pressurized tank at a pressure pg. For each experiment, we impose pg and measure Qg in 

the range 30 to 400 mL/hr using a bead-flowmeter. To observe the bubbles produced in the flow-focusing 

device right after the constriction,  we  use  a  high  shutter  speed  video  camera (Marlin) placed above the 

transparent device. We also collect bubbles at the exit of the device and measure their diameter D using a 

Nikon inverted microscope. 

 

Figure 1 : A) Schematic of the coaxial microfluidic device. The collection tube (shown on the right) is a 
cylindrical capillary of 400 µm radius and 5 cm length. It is constricted on the side that is inserted into 
the  square  tube.  The  typical  inner  dimension  of  the  square  tube  is  1  mm;  this  matches  the  outer 
diameter  of  the  untapered  regions  of  the  collection  tube.  The  diameter  of  the  narrow  orifice  in  the 
collection tube lies in the range 50 to 350 µm. B) Photograph of the constriction of device 4. Its profile 
is fitted by a polynomial function, represented by the black lines.   

 

As in previous flow focusing experiments(Ganan-Calvo and Gordillo 2001; Anna, Bontoux et al. 2003; 

Garstecki,  Gitlin  et  al.  2004;  Gordillo,  Cheng  et  al.  2004;  Garstecki,  Fuerstman  et  al.  2005;  Garstecki, 

Stone  et  al.  2005;  Utada,  Lorenceau  et  al.  2005),  we  observe  dripping,  which  produces  highly 

monodisperse  bubbles  within  the  constriction  of  the  collection  tube  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  2.  In  our 

axisymmetric geometry, the break-up of the gas thread also occurs in three stages, exactly as previously 

observed  in  a  flat  square  PDMS  microchannel  (Garstecki,  Stone  et  al.  2005).  First,  the  gaseous  thread 

enters the constriction (Fig. 2 A,B), then it proceeds through it until it reaches the collection tube where a 

bubble is inflated (Fig. 2 C-E). Finally, because the large bubble blocks the exit of the orifice, the liquid 

radially squeezes the gaseous thread and pinches it off (Fig. 2 F). The large set of monodisperse bubbles 

made  by  our  device  and  shown  in  Fig.  3A  demonstrates  that  the  production  process  is  highly 

reproducible. We observe that up to a depth of three layers inside the sample the bubbles are crystallized 

into a hexagonal close-packing. However, due to strong scattering of light by the gas liquid interfaces, we 

cannot tell whether the entire foam has such a structure.

Gas and liquid appear respectively as dark and bright regions; b=148 µm, Qg =75 mL/hr, Ql = 50 mL/hr.  

 

To  check  whether  any  bubbles  break  at  the  exit  of  the  device  and  release  their  gas  into  the 

atmosphere, we compare Qg and Ql  to the gas volume fraction of the collected dispersion. For different pg 

and Ql, we fill a container of calibrated volume and determine the gas volume fraction Φg by weighing it. 

These  data,  plotted  in  Fig.  3B  as  a  function  of  Qg  /  Ql,  follow  the  prediction  derived  from  volume 

conservation:

The good agreement demonstrates that the bubbles are not destroyed at the exit of the microfluidic device. 

Our rigid device allows gas flow rates as high as 400 mL/hr to be injected, much higher than in previously 

described PDMS based devices. Combined with Ql = 50 mL/hr, we are thus able to produce foam with 

Φg = 90%.  Therefore,  the  regime  of  jammed  close  packed  bubble  dispersions  that  are  called  foams  is 

clearly reached. We recall that the close packing fraction of monodispersed spherical objects is 0.74 for a 

face centered cubic sphere packing and 0.64 for a random packing. Moreover, the high flow rates in our 

device allow up to 450 mL/hr of monodispersed foam to be produced, as required in many applications 

and fundamental studies.

volume  conservation  (equation  1).  The  dashed  line  indicates  the  gas  volume  fraction  of  the  most 
compact possible packing of monodisperse spherical bubbles. 

 

 

Now,  we  consider  the  diameter  D  of  the  produced  bubbles  and  briefly  recall  two  different 

theoretical models proposed in the literature to explain the dependency of the bubble diameter with Qg/Ql 

(Ganan-Calvo 2004; Garstecki, Stone et al. 2005). The first deals with flows where the Reynold number 

in the liquid is high(Gordillo, Cheng et al. 2004). Based on a discussion of the unsteady and convective 
terms  of  the  Navier-Stokes  equation  the  bubble  diameter  is  found  to  scale  as  b  (Qg/Ql)0.4,  in  good 

agreement  with  the  author’s  experimental  study  (Ganan-Calvo  and  Gordillo  2001;  Ganan-Calvo  2004). 

An  alternate  model  predicts  a  linear  scaling  of  the  bubble  volume  with  Qg/Ql  and  explains  the  bubble 

formation  process  (Garstecki,  Gitlin  et  al.  2004;  Garstecki,  Stone  et  al.  2005)  as  well  as  its  excellent 

repeatability  as  follows:  The  break  up  process  occurs  in  three  stages;  first  the  gaseous  thread  advances 

into the constriction until it reaches the collection tube where a bubble is inflated. As soon as this bubble 

is large enough to block the exit of the constriction, the liquid will squeeze the gaseous thread. It finally 

reaches  a  size  for  which  it  is  unstable  and  breaks  rapidly.  The  progression  of  this  collapse  and 

consequently the rate of bubble formation are controlled by the flow rate of supplied liquid that squeezes 

the  gaseous  thread.  Because  of  the  confinement,  the  liquid/gas  interface  is  stable  during  most  of  the 

break-up; therefore, the collapsing interface proceeds through a series of quasistationary states. The last 

step of the collapse is not as reproducible as the previous ones, but since it is fast compared to the total 

break-up time, the process as a whole is periodic. Moreover, this model predicts that the bubble formation 

period  is  given  by  the  time  required  to  fill  up  the  constriction  by  the  liquid  flow.  This  determines  the 

bubble diameter:

D/b = D0/b (Qg/Ql )α. With the four microfluidic devices we study, monodisperse bubbles with diameter 

ranging from 50 to 900 µm are produced. In Table 1 the parameters α and Do and b are reported for each 

of the devices.

This  experimental  result  obtained  in  the  range  of  0.1  <  Qg/Ql  <  50  extends  by  more  than  two 

orders of magnitude the range of validity of the power law which has previously been reported, for Qg/Ql 

comprised  only  between  0.001  to  0.1  (Ganan-Calvo  2004).  This  could  be  due  to  the  confined  flow 

geometry  in  our  device  which  enhances  the  stability  of  the  flow.  We  also  observe  in  Fig.  4A  that  the 

scaling of D with b does not lead to a well defined masterplot. Indeed, the scaled diameters obtained for a 

148  µm  constriction  are  clearly  distinct  from  the  other  data.  This  may  be  explained  by  the  model 

proposed in(Garstecki, Stone et al. 2005) which predicts that to obtain a masterplot, D should be scaled 

by Ω1/3 rather than b. To measure Ω we take pictures of the constrictions of each device (Fig. 1B) and fit 

the diameter of the device as a function of the distance z  along  the  axis  of  symmetry  by  a  polynomial. 

Ω is deduced from an integration over the part of the constriction where its diameter is smaller than 1.5 b. 

The  calculated  volume  Ω  depends  only  weakly  on  the  choice  of  the  coefficient  multiplying  b  in  this 

criterion  since  at  both  ends  of  the  constrictions,  the  diameter  varies  rapidly  as  a  function  of  z.  Fig.  4B 
shows the diameter of the bubbles scaled by Ω1/3 as a function of Qg/Ql. 

Figure 4 : A) Bubble diameter scaled by the width of the constriction, versus the gas to liquid flow 
rate  ratio  for  four  different  devices  whose  characteristics  are  given  in  Table  1.  Each  data  set  is 
fitted by a power law corresponding to a straight line. B) The same data scaled by the constriction 

 

volume to the power 1/3, plotted versus the gas to liquid flow rate ratio and fitted by power laws. 
The parameters of all the fitted laws in A) and B) are given in Table 1.   

 
The collapse of the data normalized by Ω1/3 on a mastercurve (cf. Fig. 4B) over three decades of flow rate 

ratios  is  better  than  that  obtained  with  the  normalization  by  b  (cf.  Fig.  4A).  We  obtain  power  laws 
D/ Ω1/3 = D0/ Ω1/3 (Qg/Ql )α  with exponents α indicated in Table 1 whose average is 0.40 ± 0.01. Thus, 
we experimentally find that scaling the bubble diameter by  Ω1/3 rather than by b improves the masterplot. 

The values of D predicted from Eq. 2, are in good agreement with the measured values (Fig. 4B, plain 
lines). Moreover, we find that the value D0/ Ω1/3 that should be equal to 1.24 according to equation 2 is in 

good agreement with the measured values that are comprised between 0.9 and 1.4 as can be seen in Table 

1. The weak difference between the exponents (0.4 and 0.33) proposed in the two models recalled above 

(Ganan-Calvo 2004; Garstecki, Stone et al. 2005)  makes it hard to discriminate between them. However, 

only the second model accounts for the monodispersity of the obtained bubbles and predicts the observed 

dependency of the bubble diameter with the volume of the constriction. It therefore seems to provide the 

best physical description of our device. 

We now discuss the flow in the collection tube which has a major impact on the hydrodynamic 

resistance of the device as well as on the bubble formation process itself. This flow, downstream of the 

constriction where the bubbles are produced, distinguishes our foam generator from  previously described 

microfluidic  devices  where  bubbles  are  either  directly  released  into  a  liquid  filled  tank  (Ganan-Calvo 

2004) or  confined in channels of such a small height that every bubble touches the wall (Cubaud and Ho 

2004; Garstecki, Gitlin et al. 2004; Raven, Marmottant et al. 2005). In the latter case, the pressure drop 

along the collection tube is governed by the slip of Plateau borders on the channel wall, leading to a non 

linear  relation  between  the  applied  pressure  and  the  gas  flow  rate  pg  ∝  Qg

β   with β  smaller  than  one 

(Raven,  Marmottant  et  al.  2005).  Various  studies,  going  back  to  the  pioneering  work  of  Bretherton 

(Bretherton 1961) have discussed the origin of such behavior. 

 In  our  case,  the  diameter  of  the  cylindrical  collection  tube  is  wide  enough  to  contain  many 

bubbles side by side.  To understand the flow patterns that can arise in this case, we recall that foams are 

yield  stress  fluids  (Höhler  and  Cohen-Addad  2005).  Moreover,  elementary  arguments  show  that  for  a 

steady flow, driven by a pressure pg in a cylindrical tube of length L, the shear stress τ(r) varies with the 

distance from the axis of symmetry r as  τ(r)= pg r/2L.  If the driving pressure pg is so small that even near 

the tube wall τ(r) does not exceed the yield stress, plug flow is expected and the hydrodynamic resistance 

will be governed by the slip of Plateau borders on the tube wall, much like in the previously discussed 

case. In contrast, if pg is so large that for r down to the bubble radius the shear stress exceeds the yield 

stress  τy,  bulk  flow  of  the  foam  is  expected.  In  view  of  an  empirical  expression  given  in  the  literature 

depending on bubble size, surface tension, and gas volume fraction (Höhler and Cohen-Addad 2005), we 

expect τy to be smaller than 20 Pa for all of the foams produced in our experiments. As a consequence, 

bulk flow rather than plug flow of the foam is expected in the collection tube. To study the foam flow in 

the collection tube driven by the applied gas pressure pg experimentally, we measure Qg as a function of 

pg in one of our devices. These data shown in Fig. 5A are obtained for a constant ratio Qg/Ql, and hence 

for a constant gas volume fraction Φg (cf. Eq. (1) and Fig. 3) and bubble size (cf. Eq. (2) and Fig. 4). The 

data presented in Fig. 5A follow a power law with an exponent of 1.2, close to the value 1 that one would 

expect if the gas pressure pushed a Newtonian fluid through the collection tube. Fig 5B shows that the 

relationship between pg and Qg depends only weakly on gas volume fraction Φg. Note however that due to 

Eq.(1) and Eq. (2), an increase of Φg is accompanied by an increase of the bubble size. 

Figure 5 : A) Gas pressure versus gas flow rate for a constant gas volume fraction of 70 %, obtained using device 2. B) 
Global  hydrodynamic  resistance  of  the  microfluidic  device  2  versus  liquid  to  gas  flow  rate  ratio;  b=148  µm.  The 
equation of the straight line is 0.3 Ql/Qg +8. 

 

Moreover, we observe that all the data shown in Fig 5B obtained at  different pressures collapse on the 

same  curve,  as  would  be  expected  for  the  flow  resistance  of  a  tube  filled  by  a  Newtonian  fluid.  The 

hydrodynamic resistance Rg = pg/Qg  is of the order of 8 Bar.s/mL in our experiment. Using the Hagen 

Poiseuille law, we can derive the effective viscosity 160 mPa.s, well above the viscosity of the foaming 

solution. However, the question remains why the observed hydrodynamic resistance mimics a Newtonian 

behaviour at high flow rates.  

Our  experiments  demonstrate  how  a  rigid  axisymetric  flow  focusing  device  can  produce  large 

quantities of monodisperse foam with bubble diameters ranging from 50 to 900 µm. We find that the gas 

to liquid flow rate ratio governs both the foam gas volume fraction and the bubble diameter. The latter 

relation  is  found  to  obey  a  scaling  law  that  extends  over  a  range  of  flow  rate  ratios  two  orders  of 

magnitude larger than previously reported. Furthermore, our experiments strongly suggest that the bubble 

diameter  scales  with  the  cubic  root  of  the  constriction  volume  rather  than  with  the  constriction  width, 

confirming a previous conjecture.  Finally, we observe over a broad range of foam gas volume fractions 

and bubble sizes that the hydrodynamic resistance for the gas flow driving the foam in the collection tube 

depends  only  weakly  on  the  applied  pressure.  In  this  context,  further  investigations  of  the  interplay 

between wall slip and bulk flow as well as of the impact of the constriction on global flow resistance of 

the device would be of great interest. All these different findings will help to make progress towards a 

quantitative  understanding  of  the  physics  of  flow  focusing  foam  generators,  and  to  make  these  devices 

even more useful in applications.

Abstract: Rayleigh showed that inviscid flow is unstable if the velocity profile has an inflection point in 
parallel flows. However, whether viscous flows is unstable or not is still not proved so far when there is 
an inflection point in the velocity profile. Fluid viscosity has showed dual role to the flow instability. In 
this paper, it is demonstrated for the first time that viscous parallel flow with inflectional velocity profile 
is sufficient for flow instability. 
Keywords: Viscous Instability; Inflectional Velocity; Energy gradient; Viscous Friction Loss 

 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Rayleigh (1880)[1] first developed a general linear stability theory for inviscid plane-parallel shear flows, 
and showed that a necessary condition for instability is that the velocity profile has a point of inflection. 
Later,  Tollmien  (1935)  succeeded  in  showing  that  this  also  constitutes  a  sufficient  condition  for  the 
amplification  of  disturbances  [2].  Fjφrtoft  (1950)  gave  a  further  necessary  condition  for  inviscid 
instability,  that  there  is  a  maximum  of  vorticity  for  instability  [3-8].  Therefore,  it  is  well  known  that 
inviscid  flow  with  inflectional  velocity  profile  is  unstable,  while  inviscid  flow  with  no  inflectional 
velocity  profile  is  stable.  In  contrast,  it  has  not  been  theoretically  shown  so  far  whether  or  not  viscous 
flow with inflectional velocity is unstable [9-10]. The associated analysis due to the effect of viscosity is 
more difficult than that in inviscid case [2-4]. Recently, Dou (2002) [11] proposed a new mechanism for 
flow instability and turbulent transition in parallel shear flows. In this paper, based on the previous work 
[11], it is demonstrated that parallel shear flows with inflectional velocity profile for two-dimensional and 
axisymmetrical viscous flows are sufficient for instability. 
 

2. THEORY FOR FLOW INSTABILITY 
The conservation of  momentum combined  with  mass  continuity for an  incompressible Newtonian  fluid 
(neglecting gravity force) can be expressed as,

where ρ is the fluid density, t the time, V the velocity vector, p the hydrodynamic pressure, µ the dynamic 
viscosity of the fluid. 
Dou (2002) [11] demonstrated that the total energy gradient in the transverse direction of the main flow 
and the viscous friction in the streamwise direction dominate the instability and the flow transition. The 
energy  gradient  in  the  transverse  direction  tries  to  amplify  a  velocity  disturbance,  while  the  viscous 
friction  loss  in  streamwise  direction  could  resist  and  absorb  this  small  disturbance.  The  transition  of 
turbulence depends on the relative magnitude of the two roles of energy gradient disturbance and viscous 
friction damping. Based on above discussion, and referring to Eq.(1), a new dimensionless parameter, K,

direction, is defined as below (neglecting gravity force) [11],

where n denotes the direction normal to the streamwise direction and s denotes the streamwise direction. 
The occurrence  of  instability depends upon the  magnitude  of  this new dimensionless  parameter K.  The 
proposed principle can be used to both pressure and shear driven flows. But, it is assumed in this paper 
that  there  is  no energy  input (such as  shear) to  the system  or  energy  output  from the  system. Actually, 
Fjφrtoft (1950)'s criterion [5] is to exclude the shear-driven flow instability (for example, plane Couette 
flow) using Rayleigh’s criterion. The parameter K in Eq.(2) is a field variable. For given flow geometry 
and fluid, when the maximum of K in the flow field is larger than a critical value Kc, instability would 
occur [11]. Dou (2002) demonstrated that the turbulence transition takes place at a critical value of Kc of 
about 385 for both plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow, obtained excellent agreement with the 
experimental data. This result proved that the flow instability is resulted from the energy diffusion, but 
not the kind of eigenvalue instability of linear equations. Both Grossmann [12] and Trefethen et al.'s [13] 
commented that the nature of the onset-of-turbulence mechanism in parallel shear flows must be different 
from  an  eigenvalue  instability  of  linear  equations  of  small  disturbance.  From  this  result,  it  can  be 
presumed  that  the  transition  of  turbulence  in  other  complicated  shear  flows  would  also  depend  on  the 
maximum of K in the flow field. 
 
3. TWO-DIMENSIONAL FLOW 
For plane parallel flows (2D), ∂p/∂y=0, the ratio of the energy gradient to the viscous force term, K, is,

When  there  is  no  inflection  point  in  the  velocity  distribution,  K  has  a  definite  value  in  the  flow  field. 
Whether  the  flow  is  unstable  depends  on  the  magnitude  of  K  value  for  given  flow  geometry  and  flow 
condition [11].

For axisymmetrical parallel flows, ∂p/∂r=0, the ratio of the energy gradient to the viscous force term, K, 
is,

5. DISCUSSION 
The energy gradient in the transverse direction tries to amplify a small disturbance, while the energy loss 
due  to  friction  in  the  streamwise  direction  plays  a  damping  part  to  the  disturbance.  The  parameter  K 
represents  the  relative  magnitude  of  disturbance  amplification  due  to  energy  gradient  and  disturbance 

cK

damping of viscous loss. When there is no inflection point in the velocity distribution, the amplification 
or decay of disturbance depends on the two roles above, i.e., the value of K. When there is an inflection 
point in the velocity distribution, the viscous term vanishes, and while the transversal energy gradient still 
exists at the position of inflection point. Thus, even a small disturbance must be amplified by the energy 
gradient at this location. Therefore, the flow will be unstable. 
 
The  theory  can  be  used  to  explain  a  few  flow  problems.  The  flows  around  a  cylinder  displays  a 
complicated sequence of flow patterns as the Reynolds number is increased [8,14]. For many years, it has 
been  thought  that  the  basic  instability  mechanism  around  a  cylinder  (Re  exceeds  48.5)  is  likely  to  be 
inviscid because two inflection points exist in the wake [8,14] (from Rayleigh theorem). According to the 
present theory, this instability is of a viscous instability, rather than an inviscid instability. In terms of the 
present criterion, viscous flows with inflectional velocity profile is certainly unstable. We also notice that 
the Reynolds number at instability is very low (Re<50), the flow behaviour should not be inviscid, and 
viscous force must play an important role. 
 
The instability mechanism can also get some hint from solid mechanics. As is well known, the damage of 
a  metal  component  generally  starts  from  some  area  such  as  manufacturing  fault,  crack,  stress 
concentration, or fatigue position, etc. In fluid mechanics, the breaking down of a steady flow should also 
start from some most dangerous position first. For example, for the flow around an airfoil at a large attack 
angle, the flow instability first starts from the rear part on the suction side where the pressure gradient is 
large.  For  the  flow  around  a  cylinder  described  above,  it  is  known  that the  flow  instability begins  first 
from the two inflection points near the rear stagnation point. 
 
6.CONCLUSION 
Sufficient large value of transversal energy gradient has the tendency to amplify a disturbance and may 
lead to flow instability. Streamwise energy loss tries to damp the disturbance and delay the instability. A 
dimensionless field variable K is used to characterize the relative magnitude of disturbance amplification 
and damping as well as the extent of instability. When the maximum of K in the flow field is larger than a 
critical value Kc,  it  is  expected that  the instability occurs.  If  there is an inflection point in the velocity 
profile, the value of maximum of K in the flow will be infinite and the flow becomes unstable. Following 
this principle, it is proved that viscous parallel flow with inflectional velocity profile is sufficient for flow 
instability for both two-dimensional and axisymmetrical flows.

In the paper, on the basis of a new concept of the scalar-vector potential intro-
duced by the author, mechanisms resulting in the plasma pinching are considered. 

 
                                                    Introduction 
 
Pitching of plasma when an electric current flows through it, i.e., pinch-effect 

is important when studying plasma properties and possible plasma applications. 
Use of pinch-effect is a perspective direction for realization of operated thermonu-
clear synthesis. Under the description and practical use of this phenomenon there 
are many works, and we shall not result them, however, the satisfactory theory 
under the description of this effect is not present.  

In all existing works pinch-effect explain within the limits of the concept of a 
magnetic field. It is supposed, that one current strings create a magnetic field with 
which other current strings cooperate. Thus, Lorentz's force is directed in such a 
manner that between these strings takes place the attraction. But in this model there 
is one absolute obstacle, and it cannot be eliminated neither within the limits of 
classical electro-dynamics nor within the limits of the special theory of a relativity. 
It consists that in system of coordinates, which moves together with charges of 
strings, there are no magnetic fields, therefore in this system of coordinates there 
are no also forces of an attraction. Other obstacle is that in such scheme of interac-
tion in general participations do not accept ions, and is not clear, what force them 
to be compressed. Such state of affairs should brake development of works on 
research and practical use of pinch-effect, in particular within the limits of pro-
grams on operated thermonuclear synthesis. In the given paper the alternative 
theory answering on put questions is offered.

If opposite-sign charges are engaged in the relative motion, their attraction in-

             A mew value of the potential  j(r) can be introduced at the point, where the 
charge  g2 is located, assuming that  g2 is immobile and only  g1 executes the relative 
motion.

We can denote this potential as “scalar-vector”, because its value is dependent not 
only on the charge involved but on the value and the direction of its velocity as well.

The force of the interaction between the lower and upper conductors can be 
considered as a sum of four forces specified in Fig. 1 (the direction is shown by 
arrows). The attraction forces  F3 and  F4 are positive, and the repulsion forces  F1 and 
F2 are negative. 
           According to Eq. (2), the forces between the individual charge subsystems

By adding up the four forces and remembering that the product of unlike charges and 
the product of like charges correspond to the attraction and repulsion forces, 
respectively, we obtain the total specific force per unit length of the conductor.

where g1 and g2 are the absolute values of specific charges, and  V1 , V2  are taken with 
their signs. 

 We see that the forces of interaction between two current-carrying wires are 

the same as in the concept of magnetic field, however, formation of these forces 
occurs not only due to moving electrons but also ions of the lattice. In a plasma they 
are plasma ions. From relations (4) it is seen that for electrons moving at the same 
velocity with no positively charged lattice, the pinch-effect is absent which is 
observed in practice. 
              In practice this method however runs into a serious obstacle. Assuming  
+ = 0 and  V2 = 0, i.e. the interaction, for example, between the lower current-

This means that the current in the conductor is not electrically neutral, and the electric

is excited around the conductor, which is equivalent to an extra specific static charge

          In [1] it is shown that the concentration of electrons in an electron beam 
moving through an electrically neutral medium is less than that in an immovable 
beam and is defined by the relation.

In this case, the contradiction mentioned above is absent. 

  Certainly, the given approach is nonconventional, but it is very evident, since 

it is clearly clear, what forces operate between the charged particles which are 
carrying out mutual movement. Clearly, that the considered forces will lead to 
compression  a cord of the current, and forces of compression will be more, than 
forces of pushing apart.  
           We should note one more circumstance. That density of the electrons  which 
move through a lattice, less, than density motionless of the electrons, specified still 
F.London [2], however, for electrodynamics and this circumstance of greater

consequences had no thermodynamics of superconductors [3], since such amend-
ments are very small.  

However, for plasma, especially in case of pinch-effect when density of cur-

rents can reach greater sizes, this question gets special value. At greater density of 
current the difference of longitudinal density of the electrons and ions can reach 
greater sizes, and it will lead to presence of greater longitudinal electric fields. These 
fields will try to break off a plasma cord in longitudinal  a direction, leading a 
additional instability  about which we earlier did not know.  Thus, the new approach 
opens a way not only to the best physical understanding of pinch-effect, but also 
predicts the new phenomena which, certainly, it is necessary to consider at research 
and practical use of pinch-effect.

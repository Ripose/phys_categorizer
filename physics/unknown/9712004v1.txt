Abstract

An introduction is given to some selected aspects of noncommutative geometry. Simple
examples in this context are provided by ﬁnite sets and lattices. As an application, it is
explained how the nonlinear Toda lattice and a discrete time version of it can be under-
stood as generalized σ-models based on noncommutative geometries. In particular, in this
way one achieves a simple understanding of the complete integrability of the Toda lattice.
Furthermore, generalized metric structures on ﬁnite sets and lattices are brieﬂy discussed.

Introduction

Noncommutative (diﬀerential) geometry extends notions of classical diﬀerential geometry
from diﬀerentiable manifolds to discrete spaces, like ﬁnite sets and fractals, and even ‘non-
commutative spaces’ (‘quantum spaces’) which are given by noncommutative associative al-
gebras (over R or C). Such an algebra
replaces the commutative algebra of C∞-functions
on a smooth manifold

A basic concept of classical diﬀerential geometry is the notion of a vector ﬁeld. The latter
C∞(
is a derivation C∞(
). One may think of generalizing the notion of a vector
to associative algebras.[1] But there are interesting algebras, like
ﬁeld as a derivation
the (commutative) algebra of functions on a ﬁnite set, on which there is no derivation at all
except the trivial one (which maps all functions to zero). It seems that there is no adequate
general deﬁnition of a vector ﬁeld.

same way as in classical diﬀerential geometry.

There is no universal way of associating a unique diﬀerential algebra with a given asso-
ciative algebra
. In general, there is no distinguished diﬀerential algebra and one has to
understand what the signiﬁcance is of the diﬀerent choices. Even in the case of the algebra
of smooth functions on a manifold, there is actually no longer a good argument to single
out the ordinary calculus of diﬀerential forms. The latter is distinguished, however, via our
classical conception how to measure volumes. The exploration of other diﬀerential calculi
opened a door to a new world of geometry and applications in physics, as well as relations
with other ﬁelds of mathematics. Some aspects have been brieﬂy reviewed in a recent paper
[2] to which we refer for further information.1

The formalism of noncommutative geometry is an extremely radical abstraction of ordi-
nary diﬀerential geometry. It includes the latter as a special case, but allows a huge variety
of diﬀerent structures. In particular, it is possible to ‘deform’ ordinary diﬀerential geometry
and models built on it while keeping basic concepts and recipes on which the models are
based.

In the following we review some aspects of noncommutative geometry concentrating on a
few easily accessible examples. Section 2 collects basic deﬁnitions of diﬀerential calculus on
associative algebras. Section 3 recalls some facts about diﬀerential calculus on ﬁnite sets and
a correspondence between ﬁrst order diﬀerential calculi and digraphs.[3] Also a relation with
an approach of Alain Connes [4] to noncommutative geometry is explained. Section 4 treats
diﬀerential calculus on linear and hypercubic lattices. The corresponding diﬀerential calculi
may be regarded as deformations of the ordinary diﬀerential calculus on Rn. A more general
class of such diﬀerential calculi is brieﬂy discussed in section 5. The ‘lattice diﬀerential
calculus’ underlies an important example of a discrete ‘generalized σ-model’. As explained
in section 6, such models generalize a class of completely integrable two-dimensional classical
σ-models [5] by replacing the ordinary diﬀerential calculus by a noncommutative one.[6, 7]
They involve a generalized Hodge ⋆-operator. In classical (Riemannian) diﬀerential geometry,
the Hodge operator is obtained from a metric which deﬁnes the distance between two points
of the manifold. Distance functions on a rather general class of algebras have been introduced
by Connes.[4] In particular, his deﬁnition applies to discrete sets. But the relation with a
Hodge operator has still to be worked out. Section 7 is devoted to a discussion of some
metric aspects. Section 8 contains some ﬁnal remarks.

The universal (ﬁrst order) diﬀerential calculus then corresponds to the complete digraph
where all vertices are connected with each other by a pair of antiparallel arrows. Other ﬁrst
order diﬀerential calculi are obtained by deleting some of the arrows. The choice of a (ﬁrst
order) diﬀerential calculus on a ﬁnite set therefore means assigning a connection structure to

it. The latter is mirrored in the following formula for the diﬀerential of a function f

The ﬁrst equation is a special case of (11). In a ‘reduced’ diﬀerential calculus (Ω, d) where
not all of the eij are present, the possibilities to build (nonvanishing) higher forms ei1...ir are
restricted and the above formulas for ˜dei1...er impose further constraints on them.

Example. The graph drawn in Fig. 1 determines a ﬁrst order diﬀerential calculus with
nonvanishing basic 1-forms e12, e23, e14, e43. Concatenation only leads to e123 and e143 as
possible nonvanishing basic 2-forms. There are no nonvanishing r-forms with r > 2.

3.1 Representations of ﬁrst order diﬀerential calculi on ﬁnite sets

As explained above, ﬁrst order diﬀerential calculi on a set of N elements are in bijective
correspondence with digraphs with N vertices and at most a pair of antiparallel arrows
between any two vertices. On the other hand, in graph theory such a digraph is characterized
by its adjacency matrix which is an N
N -matrix
ij = 1 if there is an arrow
from i to j and
ij = 0 otherwise. One should then expect that the (ﬁrst order) diﬀerential
calulus determined by a digraph can be expressed in terms of

In the limit ℓ
0 the lattice coordinate function x naively approximates the corresponding
coordinate function on the real line R. From our last equation we then recover the familiar
commutativity of ordinary diﬀerentials and functions. The above commutation relation
makes also sense, however, on R when ℓ > 0. We then have a deformation of the ordinary
calculus of diﬀerential forms on R with deformation parameter ℓ. In the following we collect
some properties of this deformed diﬀerential calculus. Written in the form

(so that f (x + ℓ) = f (x)). It turns out that every function can be integrated.[12] Since the
indeﬁnite integral is only determined up to the addition of an arbitrary function with period
ℓ, it deﬁnes a deﬁnite integral only if the region of integration is an interval the length of

ential calculus on Rn.[15, 16] The relations (37) are obviously not invariant under (suitable)
coordinate transformations. Invariance is achieved, however, with the form (38) of the com-

6 An application in the context of integrable models

For two-dimensional σ-models there is a construction of an inﬁnite sequence of conserved cur-
rents [5] which can be formulated very compactly in terms of ordinary diﬀerential forms. This
then suggests to generalize the notion of a σ-model to noncommutative diﬀerential calculi
such that the construction of conservation laws still works. In this way one obtains a simple
though very much non-trivial application of the formalism of noncommutative geometry.[6, 7]

using (51) and the identity (48). Starting with J (1), we obtain an inﬁnite set of (matrices

Riemannian manifold, this construction reduces to the classical one.[5]

Let us (formally) deﬁne

D ⋆ dχ = λ D2χ = λ F χ .

Using A = a−1 da, the integrability condition of the linear equation (60) is the ﬁeld equation
(49).

We have extended the deﬁnition of a class of σ-models to a rather general framework
of noncommutative geometry, though still with the restriction to a commutative algebra
(which can always be realized as an algebra of functions on some space), but with
A
noncommutative diﬀerential calculi (where functions and diﬀerentials do not commute, in
general). Already in this case a huge set of possibilities for integrable models appears.[6, 7]

[dt, t] = ℓ0 dt ,

[dx, x] = ℓ1 dx ,

(63)

8There is no guarantee, however, that all these currents are really independent. For example, our formalism
includes the free linear wave equation on two-dimensional Minkowski space. In that case, the higher conserved
charges are just polynomials in the ﬁrst one (which is the total momentum).

where t and x are the canonical coordinate functions on ℓ0Z and ℓ1Z, respectively. This is
our lattice diﬀerential calculus (37) for n = 2. As a consequence, we have

dt f (x) = f (x + ℓ0) dt ,

dx f (x) = f (x + ℓ1) dx

x := (t, x) , x + ℓ0 := (t + ℓ0, x) , x + ℓ1 := (t, x + ℓ1) .

This familiar anticommutativity of diﬀerentials does not extend to general 1-forms, however.
The diﬀerential calculus has the following property.

Lemma. Every closed 1-form is exact.
Proof: For w = w0(t, x) dt + w1(t, x) dx the condition dw = 0 means ∂+tw1 = ∂+xw0. For
simplicity, we set ℓ0 = ℓ1 = 1 in the following. Let us deﬁne9

Hence w = dF .

Let us now turn to the conditions for the ⋆-operator. First we introduce gµν via

9This function is obtained by integrating w along a path γ : N → Z2 ﬁrst from (0, 0) to (t, 0) along the t-lattice
direction, then from (t, 0) to (t, x) along the x-lattice direction. The result does not dependent on the chosen
path. This follows from an application of Stokes’ theorem.

with arbitrary functions cµ(x) which have to be diﬀerent from zero in order for ⋆ to be

which extends to Ω1 via (45).

In the following, we choose gµν = ηµν which in classical diﬀerential geometry are the
components of the two-dimensional Minkowski metric with respect to an inertial coordinate
system. We then have ⋆ ⋆ w(x) = w(x
ℓ1) which, together with the above Lemma,
ℓ0 −
implies (47). Therefore, the construction of conservation laws does work in the case under
consideration. Let us look at the simplest generalized σ-model where a is just a function

which is the nonlinear Toda lattice equation [17]. In particular, in this way a new and simple
understanding of its complete integrability has been achieved. There is a ‘noncommutative
geometry’ naturally associated with the Toda lattice equation. Generalizations of the Toda
lattice are obtained by replacing the function a with a GL(n,

7 Metrics in noncommutative geometry

In the previous section we have introduced a generalized Hodge ⋆-operator.
In classical
(Riemannian) diﬀerential geometry, the Hodge operator contains information equivalent to
a metric tensor which in turn has its origin in the problem of deﬁning the length of a curve
and the distance between points of a Riemannian space. On the basis of the formalism
sketched in section 3.1, Connes proposed a generalization of the classical distance function
to discrete and even noncommutative spaces.[4] Some examples are discussed in the following
subsection.[19] The relation with a generalized Hodge operator or other generalized concepts
of a metric still has to be understood, however.

replace
also in this case. The result for the distance between the two points remains
unchanged, however.

10A diﬀerent choice of ˆD has been made elsewhere [20] to deﬁne the distance on a lattice. See also Rieﬀel [21]

for a reformulation of discrete metric spaces in Connes’ framework.

A numerical evaluation of the distance function shows that d(3, 6) . 2 < d(1, 4) < √5 and
(cid:4)
thus deviates from the Euclidean value.

The last example shows that Connes’ distance function deﬁned in terms of the adjacency
matrix of the n-dimensional oriented lattice graph with n > 1 (see Fig. 3) does not assign
to it a Euclidean geometry, as might have been conjectured on the basis of our examples 2
and 3.

8 Final remarks

This work centered around examples which live on lattices. Such spaces do not at all ex-
haust the possibilities of noncommutative geometry of commutative algebras. In this case,
and more generally in the case of discrete spaces, the generalized partial derivatives of a
diﬀerential calculus are discrete derivatives, corresponding to an inﬁnite sum of powers of
ordinary partial derivatives. There are other diﬀerential calculi where the generalized partial
derivatives are diﬀerential operators of ﬁnite order and some of them appear to be of rele-
vance for an analysis of soliton equations, for example.[22] There is much more to mention
in this context and we refer to a recent review [2] for further information and a guide to the
relevant literature.

An important aspect of the formalism of noncommutative geometry is a technical one.
On the level of generalized diﬀerential forms we have very compact expressions which are
easy to handle thanks to the simple rules of diﬀerential calculus. Decomposed into compo-
nents, however, we end up with rather complicated formulas, in general. This is precisely
the experience which especially relativists make when they encounter the Cartan formal-
ism in general relativity. Our generalization of the construction of conserved currents for
(generalized) σ-models reviewed in section 6.1 is another nice example.

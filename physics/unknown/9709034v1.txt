Abstract
The motivation for investigating the use of GaAs as a material for detecting particles in experiments
for High Energy Physics  (HEP) arose from its perceived  resistance to radiation damage. This is a
vital requirement for detector materials that are to be used in experiments at future accelerators where
the radiation environments would exclude all but the most radiation resistant of detector types.

INTRODUCTION

GaAs  particle  detectors  were  developed  for  use  in  the
experiments  currently  being  designed  as  part  of  the  new
accelerator  (the  LHC)  to  be  built  at  CERN,  Geneva.  The
estimated  radiation  fluence  foreseen  for  the  innermost
forward tracking layer of the  experiment  is  of  the  order  of
several  1014  cm-2  of  particles,  consisting  of  roughly  equal
fluxes  of  charged  hadrons  and  neutrons  with  a  typical
energy of 1 MeV. This will be accumulated over the life of
the experiment, which is projected to be 10 years.

GaAs  had  been  proposed  as  a  radiation  hard  detector
material  for  tracking  particles  in  this  very  forward  region,
where  the  radiation  environment  will  be  harshest  and
precludes  the  use  of  standard  types  of  semiconductor
radiation  detectors.  Extensive  studies[1]  have  already  been
carried  out  on  the  resistance  to  radiation  damange  of  this
material using  Gamma radiation. The purpose of this study
was  to  evaluate  the  damage  from  neutrons  and  charged
particles  with  particular  emphasis  on  pions,  as  these  are
foreseen  to  be  one  of  the  dominant  sources  of  damage  to
semiconductor particle detectors at the LHC.

MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS

All the detectors used in this study were 3 mm diameter
circular  Schottky  diodes  with  a  500  m m  wide  guard  ring
separated by 10 m m on 200 m m thick semi-insulating GaAs
substrates. The detector operates as a reverse biased diode,
the  energy  deposited  by  a  particle  creating  electron-hole
pairs  which  are  swept  out  of  the  depleted  region  by  the
applied field, which create a signal in the  front-end  charge
amplifier.  The  main  detector  characteristics  of  interest  for
HEP are the leakage current, the full depletion voltage (Vfd)
and  the  charge  collection  efficiency  (cce).  The  leakage
current  is  measured  as  an  I-V  characteristic  up  to  the
breakdown voltage or until the diode reaches a compliance
current.  Vfd  is  rather  more  difficult  to  measure  as  there  is
incomplete charge collection in the first place. This value is
measured  by  looking  for  alpha  particle  detection  on  the
back  contact  as  the  range  of  this  type  of  particle  is
approximately 20 m m in GaAs. This effect is also seen on

factor of 2 higher value in the range of interest.

The  cce  of  the  device  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the
measured  charge  to  the  total  charge  deposited  in  the
detector  by  the  ionising  particle.  The  deposition  of  energy
in the bulk of the detector depends on the type of radiation
used  to  illuminate  the  detector.  Beta  particles  with  an
energy of over 2 MeV deposit energy uniformly along their
path  through  the  detector  material  with  a  Landau  energy
distribution  and  are  known  as  minimum  ionising  particles
(MIPs). The most probable value of this deposited energy is
56 keV per 100 m m of GaAs traversed. Alpha particles lose
all their energy close to the surface of the material because
of  their  short  range  (approximately  20  m m  for  5.5  MeV
alphas  from  Am241).  This  property  is  very  useful  as  it
permits the contribution to the total charge collected by the
holes  and  the  electrons  to  be  separated  by  illuminating  the

detector  from  either  side.  This  technique  has  been  used  to
estimate the mean free path for each carrier in the material.

Neutrons  from  a  spallation  source  at  ISIS  with  a  peak
energy  of  1  MeV,  24  GeV/c  protons  from  the  PS  (Proton
Synchrotron) at CERN and 300 MeV/c pions from the PSI
facility  at  Villigen,  Switzerland  were  used  to  irradiate  the
samples.  The  energy  of  the  neutrons  is  the  typical  energy
expected for the background neutron flux at the LHC.

The pion energy is at the delta resonance and results in
maximum  damage.  The  proton  energy  is  that  used  to
irradiate  silicon  detectors  for  similar  applications  to  those
proposed for their GaAs  counterparts.

The  change  in  leakage  current  as  a  function  of
irradiation is of the order of a factor of two over the range
of interest for all types of irradiation (Fig.[1]). This change
is orders of magnitude lower than that for silicon detectors.
This is not a cause for concern for the use of GaAs devices
in  the  LHC  environment,  as  the  leakage  current  increase
would contribute, at most, a 30% decrease in signal to noise
ratio  -  an  effect  which  is  even  further  reduced  by  the  fast
shaping times proposed for the LHC experiments.
   The voltage at which full depletion occurs (Vfd) decreases
with  increasing  fluence  for  all  types  of  charged  particle
irradiation  (as  illustrated  in  Fig.2  for  protons)  and  is
consistent  with  a  decrease  in  free  carrier  concentration
similar  to  the  donor  removal  effect  seen  in  silicon  before
type inversion. From an initial fluence of around 2 x 1013 p
cm-2,  Vfd  falls  by  about  35%  from  its  pre-irradiation  value
which is always around 1 V m m-1 of substrate thickness for
the type of detectors used in this study. At  higher  fluences
Vfd remains almost unchanged.

The  cce  for  MIPs  is  the  parameter  most  affected  by
particle irradiation. The loss of charge is due to the creation
of  radiation  induced  trapping  centres  in  the  bulk.  These
either  trap  the  charge  created  by  the  traversing  particle  or
modify the electric field within the bulk of the detector so as
to enhance the trapping efficiencies of the traps present.

10,000  electron  signal  is  seen  for  a  MIP  (~40%  cce)  after
1.4 x 1014 n cm-2, 6.0 x 1013 p cm-2 and only  3.0 x 1013 p
cm-2, for the energies used. Initially, the cce falls rapidly as
a function of fluence and then decreases at a lower rate. The

value  for  each  particle  at  the  energy  of  interest[5].  In  the
case of GaAs detectors this is not so and a factor of almost 4
has  been  measured  in  the  damage  caused  by  equivalent
fluxes of neutrons and pions, with protons causing roughly
three times more damage than neutrons.

 cm-2.

 From  alpha  cce  data  it  has  been  shown  that  the  signal
from  holes  falls  faster  with  increasing  fluence  than  that
from  electrons  and  so  the  MIP  signal  after  irradiation  is
mainly due to the electron signal. If the bias is increased the
signal  begins  to  increase  again  and  this  is  due  to  a  further
increase in the electron signal as shown in Fig[3].

The differing effects from each type of irradiation on the
cce  can  be  attributed  to  the  differing  amounts  of  non-
ionising energy loss (NIEL) as the particles pass through the
crystal lattice. Fig[4] shows the correlation between cce for
200  m m  thick  detectors  measured  at  200  V  and  the
calculated  NIEL[2,3]  for  the  various  particles  used  in  this
study. The damage attributed to each particle type has been
weighted by its relative NIEL and the calculated energy loss
is well correlated with the observed damage. The radiation
induced  defects  in  the  crystal  may  be  reduced  by  thermal
introduced  by
annealing.  Arsenic  anti-site  defects 
irradiation have been shown to anneal at temperatures above
450°C [3]. Detectors were thermally annealed at 450°C in a
rapid  thermal  annealer  after  exposure  to  1  x  1014  p  cm-2.
The  electron  signal  increased  as  shown  in  Fig[5]  but  that
due to the holes hardly changed. The response to MIPs, as
illustrated  in  Fig.[6],  gave  an  increase  in  cce  to  50%  at  a
bias of 300 V.

DISCUSSION

The  radiation  damage  measured  in  GaAs  particle
detectors  correlates  very  well  with  calculated  values  of
NIEL for different particle types. The exponential decrease
in  charge  collection  efficiency  with  increasing  integrated
NIEL cannot easily be explained, as it depends on too many
parameters  which  cannot  be  measured  in  isolation.  In  Si

Calculations  of  the  NIEL  for  each  of  these  particles
indicate  that  the  particle  equivalence  which  applies  to
Silicon detectors is not valid for GaAs based detectors. The
GaAs detectors have a greater radiation hardness to neutron
irradiation than Silicon but are more susceptible to damage
from  charged  particle  irradiation.  Indeed,  recent  studies
with  Silicon  detectors  show  increased  hardness  by  using
harder design rules and subtle processing improvements [6]
which should enable them to be used in the harshest areas of
the LHC experiments for the duration of the project.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The  irradiation  studies  show  that  a  large  signal  loss  is
present  in  the  detectors  at  high  levels  of  incident  charged
hadron  fluence.  This  damage  is  consistent  with  increased
the  charged  particle
non-ionising  energy 
irradiation. Post irradiation annealing helps to recover some
of the lost charge by annealing out an electron trap. Further
studies  are  taking  place  in  an  attempt  to  improve  the
understanding  and  performance  of  these  devices  after

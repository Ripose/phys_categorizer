Abstract : 
Bright blue organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on 1,4,5,8,N-pentamethylcarbazole 
(PMC)  and  on  dimer  of  N-ethylcarbazole  (N,N’-diethyl-3,3’-bicarbazyl)  (DEC)  as  emitting 
layers  or  as  dopants  in  a  4,4’-bis(2,2’-diphenylvinyl)-1,1’-biphenyl  (DPVBi)  matrix  are 
described.  Pure  blue-light  with 
the  C.I.E.  coordinates  x  =  0.153  y  =  0.100, 
electroluminescence  efficiency ηEL  of  0.4  cd/A,  external  quantum  efficiency ηext.  of  0.6% 
and luminance L of 236 cd/m2 (at 60 mA/cm2) were obtained with PMC as an emitter and the 
2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline  (BCP)  as  a  hole-blocking  material  in  five-
layer  emitting  devices.  The  highest  efficiencies  ηEL.  of  4.7  cd/A,  and  ηext  =  3.3%  were 
obtained with a four-layer structure and a DPVBi DEC-doped active layer (CIE coordinates 
x  =  0.158,  y=0.169,  λpeak  =  456  nm).  The  ηext.  value  is  one  the  highest  reported  at  this 
wavelength for blue OLEDs and is related to an internal quantum efficiency up to 20%

1. Introduction 
 
Over the last decade, blue Organic Light Emitting Diodes (blue OLEDs) with high efficiencies have 

attracted  considerable  attention  for  their  potential  applications  to  the  full  colour  ultra-thin  flat  panel 

display  [1-7].  Moreover,  blue  light  can  be  converted  into  green  or  red  with  the  use  of  proper  dyes 

giving  the  possibility  to  generate  all  colours  from  the  blue  emitter.  This  latter  property  leads  to  an 

important  simplification  in  the  design  of  the  OLED  displays.  Very  recently,  Gebeyehu  et  al.[4] 

reported  on  efficient  blue  OLEDs  with  doped  transport  layers  in  a  p-i-n  type  structure.  From  the 

material point of view, carbazole derivatives have appeared since  the nineties to be one of the  most 

promising among various blue-emitting materials [5-9]. For example, efficient blue-light emission has 

been  reported  with  multilayer  diodes  using  distyrylarylenes  (DSA)  as  emitters:  Hosokawa  et  al.[5] 

reported an external quantum efficiency (ηext) of 2.4 % using DSA doped with amino-substitued DSA, 

whereas  Liao et al.[6] recently published a external quantum efficiency of 8.7% thanks to the use of a 

composite hole transport layer. However, the former exhibited a greenish-blue tint as the peak of the 

emitted light is 480 nm, and the later is sky-blue with Commission Internationale de l’Eclairage (CIE) 

coordinates of (x=0.15, y=0.29).  

In an earlier work, we have reported that a carbazolic dimer i.e N,N’-diethyl-3,3’-bicarbazyl (DEC) is 

a  thermally  and  electrochemically  stable  organic  compound  [10,11]  which  exhibits  interesting  pure 

blue electroluminescence in single double layer and triple layer LED configurations [12-14]. Since the 

charges injection and the transport were not optimized, quantum efficiencies of the devices remained 

small (ηext. of about 0.1%). Recently, carbazoles such as 4,4’-bis(N-carbazolyl)-biphenyl (CBP) [15-

18] or dimers and trimers of N-octylcarbazole [19] have been used as host materials for triplet emitters 

in electrophosphorescent devices.  

In this letter, we report on blue OLEDs based on the dimer N,N’-diethyl-3,3’-bicarbazyl (DEC) 

and on the novel stable carbazole i.e. 1,4,5,8,N-pentamethylcarbazole (PMC). Both can be used either 

in a five-layer structures with the 2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline (bathocuproine, BCP) 

as  a  hole-blocking  layer  or  as  a  doping  material  in  a  four-layer  structure  with  a  4,4’-bis(2,2’-

diphenylvinyl)-1,1’-biphenyl (DPVBi) matrix. The devices that uses the PMC as an emitting material 

 

2

exhibited the purest bright blue-light with the chromatic coordinates (C.I.E.)  x = 0.153, y = 0.100 and  

with an electroluminescence efficiency (EL) ηEL= 0.4 cd/A and an external quantum efficiency ηext of 

0.6%. Much higher EL performances were obtained from four-layer structures using DEC as a dopant 

of DPVBi. For an optimized doping ratio of 2%, devices displayed intense blue-light peaking at 456 

nm (CIE coordinates x=0.158 y=0.169), with ηEL and ηext as high as 4.7cd/A and 3.3% (at 10mA/cm2) 

and with a luminance L of 2835 cd/m2 (at 60mA/cm2). This ηext  value is among the highest reported 

for  blue  OLEDs  with  comparable  CIE  coordinates.  Moreover,  a  two-days  half  life  time  has  been 

observed for devices tested constinuously with a 9V voltage, under ambient atmosphere and without 

any encapsulation.

The  organic  compounds  are  deposited  onto  the  ITO  anode  by  sublimation  under  high  vacuum  (10-7 

Torr) with a rate of 0.2 – 0.3 nm/s. An in-situ quartz crystal was  used to monitor the thickness of the 

vacuum depositions. The active area of each OLED was 0.3 cm2. In (a) configuration (Fig.2(a)), we 

sequentially  deposited  onto  the  ITO  anode  :  CuPc  (copper  phtalocyanine)  as  a  hole-injecting  layer 

(HIL),  (NPB)  (N,N’-bis(1-naphtyl)-N,N’-diphenyl-1,1’-biphenyl-4,4’-diamine)  as  a  hole-transporting 

layer  (HTL),  DEC  or  PMC  as  an  emitting  layer  (EML),  BCP  (bathocuproine;  2,9-dimethyl-4,7-

diphenyl-1,10-phenantroline,) as a hole-blocking layer (HBL), Alq3 (tris(8-quinolinoato)aluminium) as 

the electron-transporting layer (ETL), and finally a LiF/Al top cathode. LiF has been found to increase 

by a 50-fold factor the device efficiency of blue OLEDs DPVBi-based compared to a device with  a 

aluminium cathode only [21]. In another strucure Fig.2 (b), both the DEC (or  PMC) layer and BCP 

layers  are  replaced  by  a  single  DPVBi-DEC  (or  DPVBi-PMC)  doped  active  layer.  The  latter  is 

obtained by co-evaporation from two separated evaporation sources. The organic materials (host and 

dopant) were co-evaporated from two resistively heated evaporation cells which were controlled by a 

temperature controller and monitored through a thermocouple inserted into the bottom of the cell. By 

careful control of the evaporation cell temperature, it was possible to precisely deposit a determined 

amount  of  dopant  molecule  dispersed  into  the  emitting  layer.  The  evaporation  rates  were  monitored 

with two separate quartz monitors and the accuracy of the doping is estimated to 10%. 

The  doping  ratios  (in  weight  %)  were  optimized  to  be  2%  of  DEC  (or  5%  of  PMC)  in  the  DPVBi 

matrix.  EL  spectra  and  chromaticity  coordinates  were  recorded  with  a  PR  650  SpectraScan 

spectrophotometer.  The  Current-Voltage  and  Current-Luminance  (I-V  and  I-L)  characteristics  of  the 

diodes were measured with a regulated power supply (ACT 10 Fontaine) combined with a multimeter 

and a 1 cm2 area silicon calibrated photodiode (Hamamatsu). All the measurements were performed 

under ambient atmosphere. 

Figure  3  shows  the  energy  levels  for  both  structures.  The  HOMO  and  LUMO  levels  and  the 

energy band gap Eg for DEC and PMC compounds were deduced from electrochemical measurements 

of their oxidation and reduction potentials. For DEC, HOMO and LUMO levels were found to be 5.6 

eV and 2.5 eV respectively whereas for PMC HOMO and LUMO levels are 5.9 eV and 2.8eV. These 

 

5

values agree quite well with those deduced from the absorption threshold of the optical spectra [22].

LUMO levels (in eV) (device (a) : for a five-layer structure with the emitting layer made

DPVBi matrix doped with DEC. 

3.Results and discussion 

Figure 4 (a) shows the EL spectra of DEC and PMC in the five-layers configuration containing 

BCP as a hole blocking layer (a-type according to figure 2). The bright blue colour emission of these 

OLEDs is clearly visible in ambient room light. The DEC EL spectrum is characterised by an emission 

peak  at  424  nm  with  a  150  nm  FWHM  (full  width  at  half  maximum),  while  the  PMC  spectrum  is 

characterized by a narrower peak at 450 nm (FWHM = 80 nm) as expected for this less π-conjugated 

structure.  Moreover  the  shoulder  at  550  nm  in  the  DEC  emission  spectrum  has  been  previously 

observed  in monolayer  OLEDs  [12]  and  attributed to  the  creation  of  excimers  or  agregates.  The  EL 

spectra of carbazole-doped or undoped  DPVBi structures (b-type devices according to figure 2) are 

shown on figure 4 (b). Spectra of the blends show a structureless feature and are almost identical to 

that of pristine DPVBi. Similar blends have already been used to improve the quantum efficiency of 

blue-light emitting devices including distyrylarylene doped with amino-substituted derivatives [5]  or

BCzVBi (an analog of DPVBi in which diphenyl end-groups are replaced by carbazole rings) doped in 

CBP [7].

applied voltage for our devices (here for a b-type device with 5% of PMC in the DPVBi host).

The electroluminescence parameters for all the devices are presented in the table 1. In optimal 

DPVBi-carbazole  doping  ratio  (in  weight  %)  the  electroluminescence  efficiencies  of  doped  devices 

were improved by a nearly two-fold factor compared to that of nondoped devices. The DPVBi DEC-

doped device exhibits a quantum efficiency of ηext = 3.3%. This value is to our knowledge one of the 

highest  reported  for  deep-blue  light  emitting  diodes,  close  value  beeing  obtained  with  a  CBP-doped 

device [7] or with spiro-anthracene or derivative of TPD in pin type device [4].

As no special attention to cavity effects was paid in the architecture of the OLED, we assume 

[23]  a  classical  light  output  coupling  efficiency  of  ηout  ≈1/2n2  ≈16  %  for  a  glass  substrate  with  a  n 

≈1.77 refractive index of the emissive layer (corresponding to the DEC refractive index extrapolation 

in the UV range), the internal quantum efficiency ηint= ηext / ηout of the device is found to be closed to 

20%. This means that 20% of the injected electrons give a photon in the material : the other 80% are in 

a first approach composed of three terms : a) the injected electrons which do not recombine to form an 

exciton  (ηa),  b)  the  excitons  that  lead  to  a  triplet  state,  and  consequently  are  not  luminescent  (ηb, 

around  75%  in  a  rough  estimation  for  non-phosphorescent  materials),  and  c)  the  exciton,  although 

singlet,  that  exhibits  a  non-radiative  decay  (ηc).  We  can  deduce  from  our  measurements  that  the 

product ηa .ηc is as high as 82 %. Regarding the LUMO and HOMO levels of the materials involved, 

an efficient electron-hole balance across the device (b) could results in those very high performances. 

Furthermore,  although  the  emission  of  the  DVPBi  being  the  major  part  of  the  EL  spectra  and  the 

energy bandgaps of both the host and the guests being equal (Eg= 3.1 eV), a Förster energy transfer 

 

9

can  not  be  completely  ruled  out  [24],  and  dopant  excitation  could  arise  from  a  better  electron-hole 

recombination with the carbazole compounds playing the role of the carrier traps according to the trap 

mechanism [25].  

Figure 6 : Current vs. Voltage characteristics of the doped and undoped structures. 

 

 

 

The  electrical  characteristics  of  the  3  host-guest  devices  (b-type  in  figure  2),  without  any 

doping,  5%  PMC-doped  and  2%  DEC-doped  respectively,  are  shown  in  figure  6.  Every  device 

exhibits  a  diode  behaviour  with  a  threshold  value  around  8V.  Noteworthy,  the  required  voltage  for 

reaching a given current density is higher for the doped devices compared to the nondoped one. This is 

in  agreement  with  the  behaviour  of  reported  devices  [24,  25]  with  dopants  working  as  carrier  traps. 

Indeed,  hole  mobility  is  expected  to  decrease  when  holes  are  trapped  into  dopants,  so  leading  to  an 

increase of the electric resistance of the emitting layer.  

Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the external quantum efficiency of the five-layer DEC based-

10

diode  (a-type)  is  one  order  of  magnitude  higher  than  the  one  obtained  for  the  previously  described 

double-layer  devices  [12-14],  the  power  conversion  efficiency  beeing  two  orders  of  magnitude  higher. 

This drastic improvement can be easily understood by considering the different HOMO and LUMO levels 

of the energy diagram shown in figure 3. Progressive steps between ITO and DEC facilitate the holes to 

diffuse  across  the  junction.  The  energy  barrier  between  the  HOMO  level  of  the  DEC  and  that  of  the 

DPVBi or the BCP (∆E ~ 0.3 to 0.5 eV) is large enough to block the hole diffusion into the emitting layer 

and thus to confine the electron-hole recombination in the active layer. Moreover the BCP, DPVBi, DEC 

and PMC LUMO levels match pretty well and thus favor the electron transport from the cathode. Hence, 

the radiative recombination is confined inside the emitting layer. Nevertheless, the energy barrier between 

the LUMO level of the BCP and that of the LiF/Al cathode (∆E=0.6 eV) needs to be reduced for further 

improvement  of  the  EL  performances.  That  shows  up  in  the  results  obtained  with  DPVBi  (table  1). 

Indeed, this molecule allows a better adjustment of the considered LUMOs (∆E= 0.1 eV). 

The C.I.E. coordinates reported in table 1 show that all the devices emitted a pure blue light and 

that the DVPBi host tends to take the emission colour of the carbazolic guest. Noteworthy the use of 

PMC as an emitting layer in a five-layer structure (device shown fig.2(a)) produces a blue light at the 

frontier of the violet-blue (C.I.E x = 0.153, y = 0.100). Furthermore, the electroluminescence of the 

blue  OLEDs  were  tested  under  ambient  atmosphere  without  any  encapsulation,  during  a  continuous 

two-days  test.  PMC-based  active  layer  structures  appear  to  live  slighty  longer  than  other  structures 

with DEC. During that 2-days test, the active surfaces were progressively polluted with dark spots and 

EL  performances  were  half  lower.  Three  distinct  degradation  mechanisms  have  been  identified  in 

small-molecule  based  OLEDs  [26],  dark-spot  degradation,  catastrophic  failure  and  intrinsic 

degradation.  The  dark-spot  degradation  is  known  to  come  from  the  aluminium  cathode  oxidation  or 

delamination due to moisture. Nevertheless this degradation mode can be reasonably solved by means 

of adequate control over device fabrication conditions (clean room, glove-box, encapsulation). 

In  conclusion,  highly  efficient  blue-light-emitting-diodes  based  on  two  carbazole  molecular 

derivatives i.e. the dimer of N-ethylcarbazole (DEC) and the 1,4,5,8,N-pentamethyl-carbazole (PMC) 

as  wide-band  gap  emitters  were  achieved.  We  emphasized  the  advantages  of  matching  both  the 

 

11

HOMOs  and  the  LUMOs  of  the  various  organic  materials  in  order  to  improve  the  electron-hole 

balance accros the junction. In such a way, efficient multilayer bright-blue light emitting diodes have 

been  fabricated.  The  DPVBi  DEC-doped  devices  exhibits  a  state-of-the-art  external  quantum 

efficiency of 3.3% related to a high internal efficiency of 20 %, whereas the theoretical maximum of 

the singlet emission is 25%.

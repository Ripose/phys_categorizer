By  representing  damage  induction  by  ionizing  particles  and  its  repair  by  the  cell,  the  probabilistic  two-stage  model 
provides a detailed description of the main processes involved in cell killing by radiation. To link this model with issues of 
interest in hadron radiotherapy, a simple physical model is used. Energy loss, its straggling, and the attenuation of the 
primary particle fluence are represented in a simplified way, based on semi-phenomenological formulas and energy-loss 
tables. An effective version of the radiobiological model is joined with the simple physical model to estimate cell survival 
along  ions’  penetration  depth.  The  predicted  survival  ratios  for  CHO  cells  irradiated  by  carbon  ions  are  presented, 
showing very good agreement with experimental data.

In 
planning 
approaches,  physical  processes  have  been  represented 
to a great detail(1), while biological processes have been 
accounted for in a schematic manner only(2,3). The need 
for  developing  detailed  biology-oriented  approaches 
has been addressed in the probabilistic two-stage model 
of radiobiological effects(4), which explicitly takes into 
account  the  interplay  of  DNA  damage  induction  by 
ionizing particles and its repair by the cell. A simplified 
version  of  the  model  has  been  applied  successfully  in 
studying  the  effects  of  single  ion  tracks  by  analyzing 
survival  data  for  irradiation  by  monoenergetic  protons 
and  light  ions(5,6).  In  the  present  work,  this  effective 
scheme is used together with a simple physical module 
representing the Bragg peak of light ions, with the aims 
to estimate the biological effects along the penetration 
depth  and  make  a  step  towards  proposing  a  biology-
oriented treatment planning approach. 

METHODS 

The  physical  model  starts  from  the  energy-loss  tables 
implemented  in  the  SRIM-2003  code(7).  Energy-loss 
straggling is represented by a corresponding straggling 
of  the  actual  penetration  depth  relative  to  that  of  a 
particle  obeying  the  mean  energy-loss  characteristics; 
phenomenological range straggling formulas(8) are used 
in this step. The effect of nuclear reactions is included 
at  the  level  of  attenuating  the  primary  particle  fluence 
only,  using  nuclear  interaction  lengths  reported  in 
Ref.(8). The products of fragmentation reactions are not 
followed  in  the  present  approach.  The  effects  of 
scattering phenomena are not reflected, either. 

As  a  radiobiological  component  of  this  work,  the 
effective model scheme based on the probabilistic two-
stage  model(4,9)  but  taking  into  account  only  damage

not repaired by the cell(5,6) is used. The model has been 
generalized  to  correspond  to  Bragg  peak  irradiation 
conditions:  The  LET-dependent  damage  probabilities 
per  single  track,  derived(5,6)  from  survival  data  for 
mono-energetic  irradiation,  are  weighted  over  LET 
spectra  generated  by  the  Bragg  peak  model.  In  this 
way, average damage probabilities per track at a given 
depth are estimated for given beam energy and fluence. 
The effects of nuclear reactions are accounted for only 
by  reducing  the  primary  particle  fluence,  i.e.  reducing 
the  average  number  of  tracks  per  cell  nucleus;  the 
contribution of fragments to cell killing is neglected.

experimental  data  from  Ref.(1),  demonstrating  that  the 
simple  physical  model  used  here  represents  the  main 
characteristics of experimental Bragg peaks. However,

since  fragmentation  processes  are  not  taken  into 
account, the model does not reproduce tails behind the 
peaks,  and  dose 
is  slightly 
underestimated.

In  Figure 2,  model  predictions  for  the  survival  of 
CHO  cells  along  Bragg  peaks  of  195  and  270 MeV/u 
carbon  ions  are  compared  to  experimental  data  from 
Refs.(10,11). Based on the Bragg peak positions reported 
in these experiments (which differ from those of Ref.(1) 
shown in Figure 1), the incident energies were adjusted 
to  187  and  264 MeV/u.  Input  parameters  of  the 
calculations were the geometrical cross-section of CHO 
nuclei(12),  σCHO = 108 µm2,  and  parameters  describing 
the  damage  probabilities(5)  derived  from  analyzing 
survival data in mono-energetic setup(12). 

the  results  of  track  structure  studies,  with  the  aim  to 
increase  the  predictive  power  of  the  model.  Although 
only  lesions  not  repaired  by  the  cells  have  been 
considered  in  the  effective  scheme  used  in  this  work, 
this  approach  can  be  generalized  in  a  straightforward 
manner  to  explicitly  represent  the  repair  processes; 
compare Refs.(4,9).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION 

The  model  predicts  survival  along  ions’  penetration 
depth  with  a  high  precision  necessary  for  treatment 
planning  applications.  Further  improvements  should 
concern  primarily  the  physical  module.  As  to  the 
radiobiological  component,  efforts  will  be  made  to 
relate  the  per-track  damage  induction  probabilities  to

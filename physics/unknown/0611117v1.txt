Abstract

As we know, from the Einstein equations the vanishing of the four-divergence of the

energy-momentum tensor follows. This is the case because the four-divergence of the

Einstein tensor vanishes identically. Inversely, we find that from the vanishing of the

four-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor not only the Einstein equations follow.

Besides,   the   so-named   anti-Einstein   equations   follow.   These   equations   must   be

considered as complementary to the Einstein equations. And while from the Einstein

equations  the  energy  density  (or   the  pressure)  can  be  found,  from  the  anti-Einstein

equations the pressure (or the energy density) can be also found, without having to use an

additional (but arbitrary) equation of state.

1. Introduction

As we know [2], the Einstein equations are ten. In order to solve them, we have also

available four degrees of gauge freedom, resulting in fixing four of the components of the

metric tensor by means of four  coordinate transformations available. Thus it is sufficient

to find from the Einstein equations only six of the ten components of the metric tensor.

Then we will have to find four additional unknowns. These are three components of the

four-velocity (the fourth component being fixed by the normalization condition for the

four-velocity), and the density (or the pressure) of the matter, the pressure (or the density)

being fixed by introducing an extra equation, the equation of state. However we can get

rid of this arbitrariness, if we take as the extra equation the equation expressing the

vanishing of the four-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor (resulting from the

4

Einstein equations). As we will see in what follows, from the integration of the equations

expressing the vanishing of the four-divergence of the energy-momentum tensor not only

the Einstein equations result. In fact the Einstein  equations are merely the  symmetric

part of the resultant equation. And the antisymmetric part constitutes what we may call

the anti-Einstein equations, which then can substitute the equation of state.

2. The anti-Einstein equations

If Gik is the Einstein tensor, defined by

the Einstein equations are given by

,

(2)

where Tik is the energy-momentum tensor. Because

G ik

” 0                                                                                                         

(3)

identically, we have

T ik

k;

.= 0                                                                                                         

( 4)

But (4) expresses the equations of motion. Thus they are contained in the field equations.

It has to be noted that (4)  has to be integrated rather than (2), because it contains

accelerations, while (2) contains only velocities.

But if we define the curl of a vector field X(m) as

m l;  ,

where the vector field Xm is taken as a solution of (12).

In   other   words   the   Einstein   equation   (2)   (ten   equations   in   ten   unknowns)   is

generalized to the system of simultaneous equations (15) & (12) (14 equations in 14

unknowns). As we observe (15) & (12) ﬁ

  (2) as a trivial case, for Xm = 0.

The physical meaning of the vector field Xm  is not clear. Perhaps Xm;l  expresses

initial velocity, since Tik contains velocities. In this case it must describe, together with

Tik, the material system, while Gik (and Rp

mlk of course) describes the geometry.

But   an   important   remark   has   to   be   made   here,  concerning  the  equation  (15).

Namely, if we write (15) as

ik

ik

T

m l

(16)

we   observe   that   the   left-hand   side   is  symmetric,  while   the   right-hand   side   is

antisymmetric. Thus, in order for the equality (16) to hold, it is necessary for both sides

to be equal to zero. So we must have both

= 0                                                                                                 

(17)

and

E

Xiklm

m l;

.= 0                                                                                                 

(18)

And, while (17) is merely the Einstein equations (cf. (2)), equation (18) is what we have

already called the anti-Einstein equations.

Note that (18) cannot be used alone. It has to always be supplemented by (12).

Having   first   found   Rp

mlk  from   the   Einstein   equations,   and   having   expressed  it   (in

principle) in terms of the energy-momentum tensor, we can then find Xp  from (12), in

terms of the components of the energy-momentum tensor. This Xp is then substituted in

(18), and differentiated. Since all of the unknowns of the problem but the pressure (or the

density) have been found, we have finally to find from (18) the four-gradient of the

pressure p (or the density ε). The pressure p (or the density ε) itself is then determined

from its four-gradient.

It has to be noted that we cannot in general express the Riemann tensor Rp

mlk  in

terms of the energy-momentum tensor. But we can do it with the Ricci tensor Rik, by

virtue of the Einstein equations. Nevertheless we cannot in general express Rp

mlk in terms

of Rik. Thus, we have to do the following: First, solve the Einstein equations for the

unknowns  stated  in  the  Introduction,  the  pressure  (or   the  density)  remaining  as   an

unknown. Second, substitute all the unknowns found plus the unknown not found yet in

equation (4) and perform the differentiations. Then (4) will be equivalent  to the anti-

Einstein equations. Third, finally, solve (4) for the gradient of p (or ε), and then find p

(or ε) from its gradient.

from the Einstein equations.

For an application of the procedure described above see [1], with the difference that

we solved for the combination p+ε, since the combination p-ε had been   found earlier

Equation (12) is an algebraical linear and homogeneous equation in Xp. So, it is

important  to  have non-trivial   solutions,  which  happens  iff  the  determinant Δ  of  the

coefficients is zero. In fact, the development of the latter is

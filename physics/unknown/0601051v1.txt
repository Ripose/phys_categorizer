Comments by William M. Gray (Colorado State University) on the recently
published paper in Science by Webster, et al., titled “Changes in tropical
cyclone number, duration, and intensity in a warming environment”
(September 2005, Vol. 309, pp. 1844-1846, www.sciencemag.org).

ABSTRACT

Recent US major landfalling hurricanes Katrina and Rita and last year's four U.S.

landfalling major hurricanes have spawned an abundance of questions

concerning the role that global warming might be playing in these events.  This

idea has been given added credence by the September 2005 Science paper of

Webster, Holland, Currie and Chang (Vol. 304, pp. 1844-1846) showing that the

global number of Category 4-5 hurricanes have increased in the last 15 years

(1990-2004) in comparison with the prior 15-year period of 1975-1989.  They

report 171 Category 4-5 hurricanes in the earlier 15-year period vs. 269 (56%

increase) in the later 15 year period.  Global mean surface temperature in the
later period has been about 0.3oC higher than in the earlier period.  The authors’

imply that their measured rise in global Category 4-5 hurricanes is likely related

to these higher global temperatures.

Having been involved with hurricane research and forecasting for nearly 50

years, I feel I have an obligation to offer comments on this paper’s primary

finding on the recent rise of global Category 4-5 hurricanes.  I do not agree that

global Category 4-5 tropical cyclone activity has been rising, except in the

Atlantic over the last 11 years.  The recent Atlantic upsurge has explanations

other than global temperature rise.

DISCUSSION

The near universal reference to this paper over the last few weeks by most major

media outlets is helping to establish a false belief among the general public that

global hurricane intensity has been rising and that global warming may be a

contributing factor.  I cannot accept the accuracy of the authors’ measurements

of global Category 4-5 hurricanes during 1975-1989 as indicated in their Table 1.

This earlier 15 year global data set would not have been able to accurately

delineate Category 4-5 hurricanes from Category 3 hurricanes or even at times

from Category 1-2 hurricanes.  It was just not possible to confidently distinguish

the dividing line between maximum sustained surface winds above or below 130

mph (110 knots) in most global storm basins during the 1975-1989 period.

In the late 1970s I visited all the global tropical cyclone centers and observed

their satellite capabilities and the training of their forecasters as part of a World

Meteorological Organization (WMO) tropical cyclone survey trip that I was

commissioned to make.  The satellite tools and forecaster training in the tropical

cyclone regions of the Indian Ocean and Southern Hemisphere during the 1975-

1989 period was not adequate for the task of objectively distinguishing Category

4-5 hurricanes from Category 3 hurricanes or to always be able to confidentially

distinguish Category 4-5 hurricanes from Category 1-2 hurricanes.  Table 1 of the

Webster et al. paper indicates that there were 32 Indian Ocean and South Pacific

Category 4-5 tropical cyclones in 1975-89 and 79 (247 percent more) during the

15-year period of 1990-2004.  Such large increases are not reasonable given our

lack of confidence in the Category 4-5 measurement techniques and the fact that

the frequencies of the weaker cyclones in these basins did not show much

difference.

This paper also presents data which shows that there has been no general

increase in the number of global hurricanes and tropical storms over the last 35

years during which global sea-surface temperatures have been rising.  I concur

2

with this measurement.  It agrees with the recent research by my colleague, Phil

Klotzbach, who has made similar tabulations.

DETERMINATION OF TROPICAL CYCLONE MAXIMUM WIND SPEEDS

There always has been, and there probably always will be, problems in assigning

a representative maximum sustained surface wind to a hurricane.  As technology

advances and the methods of determining a tropical cyclone’s maximum

sustained surface winds change, different values of maximum winds will often be

assigned to hurricanes than the values that would have been assigned in

previous years.

With the availability of new aircraft deployed inertial dropwindsondes and the new

step-frequency surface wind measurement instruments in the Atlantic, it is being

found that Atlantic hurricanes and some Northeast Pacific hurricanes that were

flown have sustained surface winds that are often stronger than would have been

estimated from wind values extrapolated from aircraft altitude.  Due to these

recent and continuing changes in measurement techniques (Franklin et al. 2003),

Saffir-Simpson category numbers in the Atlantic have and likely will continue to

creep upward.  These changes will likely be translated to other global tropical

basins.

CHANGE IN INTENSITY MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES IN THE

NORTHWEST (NW) PACIFIC

The Northwest Pacific basin is the most active of all tropical cyclone basins.  It

had aircraft reconnaissance center fixes during the period 1945-1986 but has not

had aircraft reconnaissance since.  The satellite has been the only tool to track

NW Pacific typhoons since 1987.

3

There was an anomaly in the measurement of typhoon intensity in the 14-year

period of 1973-1986 when the Atkinson-Holliday (1977) technique for typhoon

maximum wind (Vmax) and minimum sea-level pressure (MSLP) was used.  The

Atkinson-Holliday (AH) technique is known to have significantly underestimated

the maximum winds of typhoons in comparison with their central pressures.  This

interpretation has been supported by a combination of comparative satellite-

aircraft data from the Atlantic; by pre-1973 NW Pacific aircraft-measured wind-

pressure, and by the pure satellite measurement since 1987.  This topic has

been extensively reviewed by Knaff and Zehr (2005).  Table 1 shows the official

average of the annual number of super typhoons in the West Pacific (equivalent

to the number of category 3-4-5 or major hurricanes of the Atlantic).  Note that

between 1950-1972 and over the last 18 years (1987-2004), the number of

super-typhoons has averaged about five per year while during the Atkinson-

Holliday period of 1973-1986 it was less than half this number.  Yet weaker storm

frequency during the 1973-1986 period was about the same as in the earlier and

later periods.  If we disregard this anomalous 1973-1986 period and compare

annual frequency of super-typhoon activity between 1950-1972 versus 1987-

2004, we see little difference despite the recent global warming trend.

Table 1.  Comparison of the annual average of super-typhoon activity in three
multi-decadal periods in the western North Pacific.  The middle period (1973-
1986) used the Atkinson-Holliday (1977) intensity scheme.  Reported maximum
wind values were too low.

Who would believe that the annual super typhoon activity of the 14 year period

1973-86 (years AH technique was applied) would be only 44 percent of the

annual super typhoon activity of the prior 23-year period or the current 18-year

period?  This period of suppressed super-typhoon frequency during 1973-86

closely corresponded with the first 15-year period of Webster et al.’s 1975-89

Category 4-5 data.

VARIATION IN MAJOR HURRICANE NUMBERS DURING THE LAST TWO

DECADES OF GLOBAL WARMING

As tropical cyclone maximum wind (Vmax) observational techniques are frequently

not adequate to distinguish between Category 4-5 and Category 3 hurricanes, it

might be more representative to observe the increase of major hurricanes

(Category 3-4-5).  There has been US-Japanese satellite coverage of the north

Pacific during the last 20 years, and both satellite and aircraft reconnaissance

data have been available in the Atlantic.  The biggest rise in global surface air

temperature occurred during the last 10 years.  The NOAA-NCEP reanalysis of

global mean temperature differences between the last two 10-year periods show

that the last 10 years (1995-2004) of global surface temperature have been
about 0.4oC warmer than the earlier 10-year period of 1985-1994.  If there was

an influence of global warming on major hurricane activity, one would expect to

see this increase represented by greater numbers of global major hurricanes

during the last 10 years in comparison with the earlier 10-year period.

Table 2 shows the number of measured major hurricanes (Cat. 3-4-5) around the

globe (excluding the Atlantic).  Note that there has been no apparent difference

in reported major (Cat. 3-4-5) hurricanes between these two 10-year periods
despite the globe being about 0.4oC warmer in the recent period.

By contrast, the Atlantic has seen a very large increase in major hurricanes

during the last 10-year period in comparison to the previous 10-year period (38

between 1995-2004 vs.14 during 1985-1994).  The large increase in Atlantic

major hurricanes during the last 10 years is primarily a result of the multi-decadal

increase in the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation (THC) and not due to

global temperature increase.   Changes in salinity are believed to be the driving

mechanism.  These multi-decadal changes have also been termed the Atlantic

Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO).  Even when the large increase in Atlantic major

hurricane activity is added to the non-Atlantic global total of major hurricanes,

there is no significant global difference (232 vs. 256) in the numbers of major

hurricanes between these two most recent 10-year periods.

DURING THE LAST TWO 10-YEAR PERIODS

The most reliable comparison of Category 4-5 hurricanes that can likely be made

is to compare the last ten years (1995-2004) with the prior ten years (1985-1994)

for the storm areas monitored by the US and Japan.  The two North Pacific

basins do not indicate that the number of hurricanes of Category 4-5 intensity

have increased in the last 10 years when global surface temperature have risen

(Table 3).

COMPARISON OF ATLANTIC HURRICANE ACTIVITY BETWEEN THE LAST

15-YEAR ACTIVE PERIOD (1990-2004) WITH AN EARLIER ACTIVE

15-YEAR PERIOD (1950-1964)

There have been past hurricane periods in the Atlantic which have had just as

many major hurricanes and Category 4-5 hurricanes as in recent years.  A

comparison of the last 15 years of hurricane activity with an earlier 15-year

period from 1950-64 shows no significant difference in major hurricanes or

Category 4-5 hurricanes (Table 4) even though the global surface temperatures

were colder and there was a general global cooling during 1950-64 as compared

with global warming during 1990-2004.  The maximum sustained winds from

1950-1964 have been adjusted downward using the Landsea (1993) adjustment

factor.

7

The number of weak tropical storms rose by over 50 percent during this later 15

year period, however.  This is a reflection of the availability of the satellite in the

later period.  It would not have been possible that a hurricane, particularly a

major hurricane, escaped detection in the earlier period.  But many weaker

systems far out in the Atlantic undoubtedly went undetected before satellite

observations.

SUMMARY

Despite what many in the atmospheric modeling and forecast communities may

believe, there is no physical basis for assuming that global tropical cyclone

intensity or frequency is necessarily related to global mean surface temperature
changes of less than ±0.5oC.  As the ocean surface warms, so does the global

upper air temperature to maintain conditionally unstable lapse-rates and global

rainfall rates at their required values.  Seasonal and monthly variations of SST

within individual storm basins show only very low correlations with monthly,

seasonal, and yearly variations of hurricane activity.  These correlations are

typically of the order of about 0.3, explaining only about 10 percent of the

8

variance.  Other factors such as tropospheric vertical wind shear, surface

pressure, low level vorticity, mid-level moisture, etc. play more dominant roles in

explaining hurricane variability on shorter time scales.  Although there has been

a general global warming over the last 30 years and particularly over the last 10

years, the SST increases in the individual tropical cyclone basins have been

smaller (about half) and, according to the observations, have not brought about

any significant increases in global major tropical cyclones except for the Atlantic

which as discussed, has multidecadal oscillations driven primarily by changes in

salinity.    No credible observational evidence is available or likely will be

available in the next few decades which will be able to directly associate global

temperature change to changes in global Category 4-5 hurricane frequency and

intensity.

Abstract. Experimental tests are described to check solid  241Am radioactive sources used to 
monitor  operation  of  liquid  xenon  detectors.  In  particular,  radioactive  leakage  was  tested  in 
extreme  temperature  conditions  following  immersion  in  liquid  nitrogen  for  different  time 
periods. No radioactivity loss was detected from the sources considered. The paper describes 
the source characteristics, test methods and results obtained.

1. Introduction 
 

Alpha and beta solid radioactive sources are more and more used as check/monitor sources 
for liquid xenon detectors [1, 2]. The MEG experiment [3, 4] is the first that extensively used 
alpha  sources  distributed  within  the  sensitive  volume  of  a  100  L  prototype  liquid  Xenon 
calorimeter.  Larger  calorimeters  (800  L)  are  under  construction.  In  this  experiment,  several 
point  sources  were  mounted  onto  thin  gold-plated  tungsten  wires.  A  number  of  these  wires 
were fixed to the calorimeter walls and fully immersed in liquid Xe (165 K) for long period of 
time.  A  number  of  other  different  sources  from  two  manufacturers  [5,  6]  were  also  used  in 
preliminary work with prototype Xenon calorimeters. 

Radioprotection  requirements  are  then  established  to  prevent  significant  radioactive 
contamination of the liquid scintillator. Furthermore, if such a contamination should occur, it 
would  results  in  an  increase  of  the  intrinsic  scintillation  background  with  unwanted  loss  of 
sensitivity. 

Stringent tests for leakage and contamination are essential feature for all radioactive source 
production  [7].  The  test method  adopted  depends  on  the  design  and  intended  application  of 
the source and, also, on statutory requirements. For the specific intended  use of Xe detector 
check  sources,  leakage  tests  normally  required  for  solid  sealed  sources  [7],  cannot  be 
exhaustive  enough.  The  extremely  low  temperature  conditions  could  introduce  different 
mechanical and chemical-physical effects giving rise to a loss of radioactive material. 

To meet these particular requirements, additional modified tests are needed, in particular to 
quantify  the  degree  of  radioactive  leakage  from  solid  radioactive  sources  following 
immersion  in  cold  liquids,  before  their  use  in  undergoing  experiments.  These  test  were 
requested  by  the  Italian  part  of  the  MEG  collaboration  (INFN)  to  the  National  Institute  for 
Ionising Radiation Metrology of ENEA (INMRI-ENEA) and are described in this paper.

2. Source characteristics 
 

Tests were performed on three different types of sources. Sources a) and b) were made on 
small  gold  plated  disks,  5  mm  and  25  mm  diameter  respectively.  Source  c  was  made  on 
100 cm long thin wire. Main characteristics of these sources are reported in Table I.

The  sources  were  preliminary  tested  for  leakage  and  contamination  by  the  manufacturer 

according to usual ISO requirements [7]. 
 
3. Test methods 
 

The following additional tests were applied at INMRI-ENEA, on each source sequentially: 
 
a)  Immersion in acetone: the source is immersed in acetone bath at 20 °C for 6 hours,  the 

removed activity is measured; 

b)  Wiping (only for sources a and b): the source is wiped with a paper filter, moistened 

with water, the removed activity is measured; 

c)  Fast immersion in liquid nitrogen: the source is repeatedly immersed 5 times in liquid 

nitrogen bath at 77 K for 3 min each, the removed activity is measured; 

d)  Long immersion in liquid nitrogen: the source is immersed in liquid nitrogen bath at 

77 K for 1 hour, the removed  activity is measured. 

 

 

 

The  tests  were  designed  to  check  radioactive  leakage  under  different  conditions.  Liquid 
nitrogen  was  used  instead  of  xenon  for  immersion  tests  as  it  is  characterised  by  a  lower 
temperature  (77 K) and easier availability. 

Immersion  tests  were  made  in  a  polystyrene  cubic  vessel,  70  mm  side,  internally  covered 
with a circular thin aluminium foil, 50 mm diameter. After complete evaporation of the liquid, 
the aluminium foil was removed and opened. This was then alpha-counted to check for any 
radioactivity leakage from the source. 

Each aluminium foil was counted 5 times before and after each test. The three sources were 
also  counted  to  detect  any  possible  effect  of  the  treatment  on  the  particle  emission  rate. 
Background  and  blank  measurement  were  performed  between  two  foil  counts.  Standard 
sources, calibrated by the INMRI-ENEA, were used for calibration and for repeated counting 
system stability checks. 

Alpha counting was performed on a Thermo Eberline ESM  FHT 650 K1 low background 
counting system equipped with an active anticoincidence shield  (Table II). Constant counting 
times of 6000 s (sources a and b) and 3000 s (source c) were imposed for background, blank 
and source counting. Sources c were measured in a building other than that for sources a and 
b, and characterised by lower and more stable environmental background.

Blank  and  background  (BB)  count  rates  were  not  distinguishable  as  well  as  those  for 
aluminium foils and paper filters (AP). For simplicity they were then grouped in the following 
description of the test results. Both BB and AP readings were not Poisson distributed, being 
other sources of variation present other than pure statistical fluctuations.

The  mean  and  experimental  standard  deviation  of  BB  and  AP  count  rates  were  then 
obtained from repeated readings. The mean BB count rate was subtracted from any individual 
AP  count  rate  value.  Decision  thresholds  and  detection  limits  were  calculated  for  the 
individual and mean count rate values, according to relevant ISO recommendations [8], taking 
into account the different degrees of freedom for BB and AP readings and assuming a level of 
confidence of 95% (α=β=0.05)  . The results  obtained  for sources a, b and c are  reported in 
Table III.

Figure 1 – Combined distributions of individual net count-rate values for BB and for AP, for sources a, b (graph 
a) and c (graph b). No significant difference between the BB and AP distributions can be observed. Statistical 
analysis  confirms  this  intuitive  conclusion.  Almost  the  same  fraction  of  BB  and  AP  results  overcomes  the 
decision thresholds.

The BB and for AP net count-rate distributions are reported in Fig. 1 and 2. No significant 
difference  can  be  found  between  the  two  distributions.  No  one  mean  AP  count  rate  value 
resulted higher than the respective decision threshold. 

Repeated measurements of disk sources did not reveal any change in the counting efficiency 

confirming the sources stability. 

This results were then considered satisfactory for the intended use of the sources.

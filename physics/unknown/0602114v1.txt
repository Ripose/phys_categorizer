Abstract 

In  this  study  we  present  first  results  from  a  new  detector  of  UV  photons:  a 
thick gaseous electron multiplier (GEM) with resistive electrodes, combined with 
CsI or CsTe/CsI photocathodes.  

The hole-type structure considerably suppresses the photon and ion feedback, 
whereas  the  resistive  electrodes  protect  the  detector  and  the  readout  electronics 
from damage by any eventual discharges.  

This  device  reaches  higher  gains  than  a  previously  developed  photosensitive 
RPC  and  could  be  used  not  only  for  the  imaging  of  UV  sources,  flames  or 
Cherenkov  light,  for  example,  but  also  for  the  detection  of  X-rays  and  charged 
particles.

I. Introduction 

There  has  been  recently  considerable  interest  on  Ultra  Violet  (UV)  imaging  detectors,  with 
have applications on homeland security [1]and on the detection of small forest fires or corona 
discharges at large distances [2].  

The  most  commonly  used  UV  imaging  detectors  are  image  intensifiers  combined  with 
narrow-band  filters  transparent  in  the  240  to  280  nm  band  [3].  At  this  wavelength  range, 
called "solar blind", the daytime detection of UV light occurs with practically no background 
of solar radiation, which is absorbed by the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere and does not 
reach the Earth surface. Thus the UV light emitted from fire or electrical discharges may be 
detected with a very high signal to background ratio. For example, a small forest fire can be 
detected by such a device up to a distance of several kilometers [4]. 

Recently  we  have  developed  a  new  type  of  detector  of  single  UV  photons:  Resistive  Plate 
Chambers (RPCs) combined with CsI or CsTe photocathodes [5]. These RPCs operate at high 
gas  gains  (up  to  106)  and  the  resistive  electrodes  to  protect  the  readout  electronics  from 
damage by possible discharges. With a position resolution of 30 µm for single photoelectrons 
these  could  also  be  used  in  UV  imaging  applications,  like  RICH  or  in  the  visualization  of 
flames air. Preliminary tests on flame detection show that our RPCs have the same sensitivity 
as the solar-blind MCP-based image intensifiers [6]. This is because the image intensifiers are 
combined  with  narrow  band  filters  having  a  transmission  close  to  10%  at  the  peak  of  the 
transmission  curve,  while  our  RPCs  operate  in  a  photon  counting  mode  without  any  filters. 
Even  better  sensitivity  may  be  expected  if  the  RPC  could  be  combined  is  with  CsTe 
photocathodes, whose quantum efficiency overlaps better with the flame emission spectra [5]. 
First  results  show  that  RPCs  combined  with  CsTe  photocathode  can  operate  stably,  but  the 
maximum achievable gain was limited to approximately 103 owing to feedback problems. 

In  this  work  we  developed  an  innovative  hybrid  device:  a  thick  GEM-like  [7]  electron 
multiplier  (TGEM  [8],[9],[10])  with  resistive  electrodes,  which  we  call  “Resistive  Thick 
GEM  -  RETGEM”.  The  hole-type  structure  considerably  suppresses  the  photon  and  ion 
feedback, while the resistive electrodes protect the detector and the readout electronics from 
damage by any eventual discharges.  

II. Detectors and Experimental Set Up 

A schematic drawing of the detector is shown in Fig.1.  

It  contains  a  semitransparent  CsI  photocathode,  20  nm  thick,  deposited  on  a  CaF2  disc  and 
placed  7 mm  away  from  the  electron  multiplier.  This  is  constituted  by  a  hole-type  structure 
composed of a G-10 plate either 2 mm thick with holes of 1 mm diameter and 1.6 mm pitch 
(see  [8])  or  0.4  mm  thick  with  holes  of  0.3 mm  diameter  and  a  pitch  of  0.7  mm.  The  Cu 
coating of the G-10 plate was almost fully removed (except in some very small random spots) 
and  both  surfaces  were  covered  with  a  graphite  paint  typically  used  in  RPCs  [11].  The 
graphite coating around the holes on a distance of approximately 0.25 mm was removed by a 
drill of a larger diameter.  

The  readout  plate  was  segmented  in  metallic  pixels  with  1.27  mm  pitch  (similar  to  the  one 
described in [9]) and placed 0.4 to 1 mm below the RETGEM anode. To simplify the readout 
electronics,  in  most  of  measurements  the  pixels  were  electrically  connected  in  rows  and 
amplifiers were connected to each row, providing a 1D projection of the image. 

Two RETGEM operation modes were considered: with the gas gain occurring inside the holes 
–  “mode  A”  (Fig.  2a)  -  and  with  the  gas  gain  occurring  in  the  gap  between  the  RETGEM 
anode and the readout plate – “mode B” (Fig. 2b).  

The  ensemble  was  installed  inside  a  gas-tight  chamber  equipped  with  a  CaF2  window,  as 
shown  in  Fig.  2.  As  UV  sources  we  used  candles and a pulsed (few ns) UV lamp. In  some 
tests a quartz lens was used to project the image of the UV sources on the photocathode. For 
gain  measurements,  down  to  unit  gain,  the  H2  pulsed  lamp  was  attached  to  the  chamber 
window via an Ar-flushed tube. 

For rate capability measurements we used an X-ray generator and replaced the photocathode 
by a wire mesh that defined an X-ray conversion gas volume above the RETGEM.  

Comparative measurements were performed with a TGEM, a photosensitive RPC and an UV 
image intensifier developed by Reagent (described in [6]). To make comparisons easier, these 
tests were done in the same gas mixtures as we used before for the photosensitive RPCs and 
TGEMs: Ar+5%CH4, Ar+5% isobutane [12] and He+0.8%CH4+EF* [5] at a total pressure of 
1 atm.  

III. Results 

In Fig. 3 we show the effective gain as a function of the voltage applied across the TGEM and 
RETGEM detectors operating in mode A. The effective gain is the ratio of the primary charge 
to the charge collected on the readout electrode; therefore it is somewhat lower than the total 
multiplication. It is apparent that, owing to the resistive coating, the RETGEM allows much 
larger gains to be achieved.  

In  the  same  figure  one  may  appreciate  that  at  the  larger  voltages  RETGEM  develops  a 
mixture of pulses with very different amplitudes, represented by the open and filled symbols. 
This corresponds to the appearance of mild discharges (commonly denoted by “streamers” in 
RPC  terminology)  whose  maximum  current  is  limited  by  the  resistive  electrode.  If  not  too 
frequent,  these  do  not  hinder  the  normal  operation  of  the  detector  and  not  propagate  to  the 
readout  plate  even  if  a  few  kV  were  applied  between  the  anode  of  the  RETGEM  and  the 
readout  plate.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  behavior  of  GEM  or  TGEM  detectors,  where 
discharges in holes may easily propagate to the readout plate (see [13] for more details).  

As  the  voltage  is  further  increased,  permanent  discharges  may  appear  in  some  holes.  These 
are not destructive but will reduce the effective applied voltage and normal operation becomes 
impossible. 

The performance of the RETGEM combined with the CsI photocathode is also shown in Fig. 
3. 

Fig.  4  shows  the  effective  gain  as  a  function  of  the  voltage  applied  between  the  lower 
electrode of the RETGEM and the readout plate (mode B – see Fig. 1b) and, for comparison, 
for the RPC described in [5], both combined with a semitransparent CsI photocathode. Again, 
it  is  clear  that  RETGEM  reaches  higher  gains  than  the  photosensitive  RPC  owing  to  the 
photon feedback suppression provided by the hole-type structure.  

Fig.  5.  shows  gain  vs.  counting  rate  curves  for  TGEM  and  RETGEM  detectors  illuminated 
with  X-rays.  The  gain  of  the  TGEM  practically  does  not  change  with  rate,  whereas  the 
RETGEM gain drops with rate in a way qualitatively similar to low resistivity RPCs [14]. At 
counting rates larger than 106 Hz/cm2 some kind of glow discharges may appear in the holes

or  in  the  gap  between  the  RETGEM  and  the  readout  plate.  However,  these  were  mild  and 
harmless to the readout electronics.  

One of the goals of this work was to investigate the possible application of RETGEM to flame 
imaging. Fig. 6 shows the 1D projection of the candle flame image obtained with the set up 
shown in Fig. 2. For this particular measurement the candle was placed 1.5 m away from the 
detector  and  the  counts  were  accumulated  during  0.1 s.  When  the  candle  was  placed  30 m 
away it produced counting rates on the order of a kHz, to be compared with a background of 
less than 10 Hz in a room fully illuminated by natural or fluorescent lights  

We also performed quantitative comparisons between the RETGEM and a single-wire counter 
with CsI photocathode previously developed by us [15]. Both detectors had almost the same 
sensitivity  to  the  flame  and  could  operate  in  fully  illuminated  rooms.  However,  in  sunlight 
conditions the signal to noise ratio k=S/N (where S is the excess counting rate produce by the 
flame and N is the counting rate without the flame) was small (k«1). However, for RETGEM 
the  signal  to  noise  ratio  was  much  higher:  S/N~kn,  where  n  is  the  number  of  pixels  in  the 
readout  plate.  This  was  because  the  image  of  small  flames  occurring  far  from  the  detector 
occupied  one  or  a  few  pixels,  whereas  the  diffuse  sunlight  was  distributed  over  all  pixels. 
Moreover, direct sunlight was also projected on a few pixels and would not interfere with the 
image  of  the  flame.  If  necessary,  when  operating  in  mode B,  the  pixels  irradiated  by  direct 
sunlight  could  be  electrically  disconnected  (left  floating),  drastically  reducing  the  local  gas 
gain and sparing the CsI photocathode. 

First  tests  of  RETGEM  combined  with  CsTe/CsI  photocathode  [6]  were  also  performed, 
yielding the results shown in Fig. 4. A maximum gain larger than 104 was reached, which is 
almost an order of magnitude larger than what is possible with an RPC combined with CsTe 
photocathode [5]. 

Finally  we  performed  preliminary  comparisons  of  the  RETGEM  characteristics  with  an 
MCP-based image intensifier [6]. Both detectors had the same sensitivity for flames occurring 
in  rooms,  but  the  image  intensifier  had  better  signal  to  noise  ratio  for  flames  detected  in 
sunlight conditions. One of reason for this was  that the image intensifier had a much larger 
number  of  pixels.  Probably  RETGEM  combined  with  micropixel  redout,  such  as  MediPix, 
will be able to compete with image intensifiers for outdoor UV detection. 
 

IV. Conclusions 

The development described in this work, the Resistive Thick GEM (RETGEM), suggests that 
RETGEM  is  a  new  promising  gaseous  detector  which  combines  the  spark  protective 
properties of the RPC with the unique properties of the hole-type structures/GEM, such as the 
possibility  to  extract  electrons  from  the  holes,  directing  them  to  another  multiplication 
structure or to the readout electrodes and the efficient suppression of photon and ion feedback. 
This opens the possibility to combine RETGEM with various photocathodes and use it as an 
UV imaging device. Probably, after further developments, RETGEM-based imaging devices 
may become compact and simpler alternatives to the UV image intensifiers used today. 

When combined with a CsI photocathode, RETGEM could be particularly valuable in RICH 
detectors, as it allows large gas gains over large areas and it is protected from the discharges 
that might be triggered by highly ionizing particles. Obviously, RETGEM could be also used 
for the detection of charged particles. 

As in the case of RPCs [16],[17], by optimizing the resistivity of the coating one can probably 
the rate characteristics of the RETGEM may be considerably improved, further enlarging the 
application fields. 

Further developments may include the manufacture a microhole resistive electrode structure 
or resistive micromesh (as was suggested in [18]) and this in turn will open new applications. 
For  example,  such  a  resistive  micromesh  could  be  an 
to 
MICROMEGAS or GEMs combined with MediPix readout, as the resistive mesh will protect 
the Medipix from destructions in the case of occasional discharges.

ABSTRACT 

 
A  spectrally  tunable  VCSEL  (vertical  cavity  surface-emitting  laser)  was  used  as  part  of  sensing  hardware  for 
measurements  of  the  radial-integrated  gas  temperature  inside  an  inductively  coupled  plasma  reactor.  The  data  were 
obtained  by  profiling  the  Doppler-broadened  absorption  of  metastable  Ar  atoms  at  763.51  nm  in  argon  and 
argon/nitrogen plasmas (3, 45, and 90% N2 in Ar) at pressure 0.5-70 Pa and inductive power of 100 and 300 W. The 
results were compared to rotational temperature derived from the N2 emission at the (0,0) transition of the C3Πu–B3Πg 
system.  The  differences  in  integrated  rotational  and  Doppler  temperatures  were  attributed  to  non-uniform  spatial 
distributions of both temperature and thermometric species (Ar* and N2*) that varied depending on conditions. A two-
dimensional,  two-temperature  fluid  plasma  simulation  was  employed  to  explain  these  differences.  This  work  should 
facilitate  further  development  of  a  miniature  sensor for non-intrusive  acquisition  of data  (temperature  and  densities  of 
multiple  plasma  species)  during  micro-  and  nano-fabrication  plasma  processing,  thus  enabling  the  diagnostic-assisted 
continuous optimization and advanced control over the processes. Such sensors would also enable tracking the origins 
and pathways of damaging contaminants, thereby providing real-time feedback for adjustment of processes. Our work 
serves as an example of how two line-of-sight integrated temperatures derived from different thermometric species make 
it possible to characterize the radial non-uniformity of the plasma. 
 
Keywords:  diode laser, plasma processing, optical diagnostics, 2-D simulation, gas temperature. 

 
1. INTRODUCTION 

 
A  wide  variety  of  plasma-based  processes  have  been  developed  in  the  microelectronics  industry.  These  techniques 
(plasma  etching,∗  plasma-enhanced  chemical  vapor  deposition,†  ion  implantation,  sputtering,  ashing,  dry  cleaning,  etc.) 
are  being  applied  for  synthesis  and  treatment  of  micro-  and  nano-scale  structures.  New  plasma  technologies  are  also 
being developed, in particular, for fabrication and functionalization of carbon nanotube-based devices. The latest trends 
in development of nanoelectronics have clearly indicated that further progress in this field is contingent upon creating 
means  to  incorporate  the  nano-structured  architectures  in  larger  CMOS-platform  micro-configurations.1-5    Thus, 
development  of  the  plasma  treatment  techniques  applicable  to  both  nano  and  micro  realms  (in  both  top-down  and 
bottom-up fabrication technologies) is necessary. 

Single impurity atoms or molecules change drastically the local electronic properties of the nanostructures. Such changes 
may  be  purposely  used  in  nano-scale  design  but  may  also  be  extremely  damaging  in  applications  where  defect-free 
structures are desirable as the size of a “killer” defect falls below one nanometer (<10% the size of the device). Anchoring 
specific  molecular  groups  to  the  structural  surfaces  is  the  major  way  to  design  and  functionalize  the  nanotube-based 
systems.6,7    Metals  for  nanotube  doping  (Cs,  K,  Li,  Rb)  and/or  residues  of  common  catalysts  (Co,  Ni,  Fe  used  in  the 
nanotube synthesis) can damage transistor gates if inadvertently transferred into the gate area during other fabrication and 
assembly steps. Hence, atomistic control over dopant placement and contamination monitoring is required.  

The probability of contamination and product susceptibility to damaging contamination are multiplying with the increase in 
functionality and density of integration. The most problematic contaminants for nano- and microelectronic fabrication are 
atomic  metals,  residual  moisture  and  oxygen,  volatile  organic  molecules,  and  nano-size  particulates.  Continuous  in  situ 
monitoring of reaction kinetics, local temperature values and physical plasma parameters; determination of a multitude of 
species; and understanding of the paths of low-level contamination that occurs in the fabrication process are necessary to 
enable fine optimization through a sensor-driven feedback with high sensitivity and sharp spatial resolution.

Diode laser based optical diagnostics are ideal for non-intrusive in situ measurement of temperature in the vicinity of the 
nano/micro-structures  and  determination  of  densities  of  important  plasma  species  responsible  for  fabrication  or 
functionalization of devices and detection of damaging contaminants. This can be realized by profiling Doppler widths 
of  absorption  lines  and  by  using  tunable  laser  based  absorption  spectrometry  with  signal  enhancement  in  an  actively 
modulated high-finesse optical cavity. 

Analytical  hardware  and  methodology  required  for  these  techniques  are  simple,  straightforward  and  robust.  The 
technology  possesses  a  unique  combination  of  qualities  necessary  for  the  in  situ  ultrasensitive  determination  of  the 
micro-scale  local  parameters  in  real  time.  It  is  also  capable  of  continuous  measurements  of  the  physical  plasma 
parameters  such  as  electron  density  and  temperature,  gas  temperature  and  velocity,  and  absolute  densities  of  various 
reacting species. The multiplexing capacity of the diode lasers can be utilized for the comprehensive  multi-parametric 
data acquisition by means of a single, simple, compact, and inexpensive tool. 
 

2. ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY WITH DIODE LASERS 

 
In nano- and micro-fabrication, temperature measurement around the developing features is of great interest. Synthesis 
quality  is  affected  by  the  local  microenvironment  where  temperature  plays  a  distinct  role.  Inherent  to  diode  lasers, 
excellent spectral resolution allows examination of the lineshapes that yield both Gaussian and Lorentzian components.8  
As a result, the gas kinetic temperature is derived from the Doppler width; electron number density can be derived from 
the  Stark  broadening.  The  Stark  centerline  shift  is  indicative  of  the  electron  temperature.  A  laser  beam  can  be  easily 
adjusted to analyze the immediate vicinity of the growing nanostructures (or features etched down) in real time. 
 
2.1 Continuous-wave cavity ring-down spectroscopy 

Application  of  the  diode  laser  based  absorption,  enhanced  in  a  modulated  high-reflectivity  optical  resonator  is  a 
technique  in  principle  capable  of  recording  absorption  from  single  atoms  or  molecules  at  strong  spectral  lines  and 
fundamental bands.9  It can also characterize nano-size particulates in the plasma reactor. This technique is based on the 
measurement  of  the  rate  of  absorption  of  laser  radiation  confined  in  a  high-quality  resonator  and  may  be  referred  as 
continuous-wave  cavity  ring-down  spectroscopy  (cw-CRDS).  The  ultimate  sensitivity  of  CRDS  results  from  both  its 
immunity to fluctuations of the laser intensity and a very long absorption pathlength (up to ~10 km) within the cavity. 
Calibration at the absolute scale follows directly from the Beer-Lambert law. The diode laser induced fluorescence10-13 
can be simultaneously recorded, which adds three-dimensional resolution.  
The  cw-CRDS  is  significantly  more  sensitive  at  much  higher  spectral  resolution,  relative  to  other  non-intrusive 
diagnostics (emission, UV absorption, FTIR). Non-optical diagnostics require sampling or extraction from plasma and, 
hence, are intrusive. CRDS can resolve many of the isotopic molecules and is unaffected by isobaric mass interferences 
that are so ubiquitous and problematic in mass-spectrometry. 

The  wavelength  range  covered  by  commercially  available  diode  lasers  that  require  no  cryogenic  cooling  extends 
currently  from  0.3  to  2.8  µm  and  will  be  widening  in  future.  Within  this  range,  many  atomic  and  virtually  every 
inorganic molecular species can be probed at their electronic or vibrational transitions. Hence, CRDS with diode laser 
sources is an almost universal technique for monitoring plasma species, temperature and other parameters. Determination 
of  a variety  of  elements  by  atomic  absorption with  the  tunable diode  lasers  have been  reported  (e.g.,  Al,14  Ba,15  Ca,16 
Cr,17 Cs,18 Cu,19 Gd,20 Hg,21 I,22 In,23 K,24 La,25 Li,26 Mn,27 Pb,24 Rb,11,18 Sm,28 U,29 Y,30 Zr31) and many more listed32 as 
possible at doubled laser frequency: Ag, Co, Eu, Fe, Ga, Hf, Ho, Lu, Mo, Nb, Nd, Ni, Os, Re, Rh, Ru, Sc, Tb, Th, Ti, Tl, 
Tm, V, and W. Densities of common molecular contaminants and major plasma constituents, such as H2O, OH, O2, CO, 
CO2, CH4, NH3, HCl, and HBr have also been measured by diode laser based absorption.33-39  Measurement of the CF2 
and CF4 etching-related molecules at combination bands (3ν1+ν3) and (ν1+3ν3) around 2.12 µm by cw-CRDS has been 
suggested.40  An  array  of  species  CnHm  (n,m=0,1,…4)  important  for  nanotube  growth41  can  be  resolved  at  their 
vibrational overtones (2ν3=1.7µm, 3ν3=1.14µm, 4ν3=0.87µm).  
We  consider  here  only  those  diode  lasers  that  operate  at  room  temperature.  Substantial  research  in  plasma  etching 
diagnostics  has  been  carried  out  with  lead-salt  diode  lasers  that  operate  in  mid-infrared  but  have  to  be  cryogenically 
cooled. Measurements of CFX, C2F6, CHF3, FCN, CH3, CH4, C2HX, CH3OH, SiHX, SiF4, SF6, BCl3 and atomic Cl have 
been  performed  in  the  7-17µm  region  for  research  purposes.42-49    However,  lead-salt  laser  spectrometers  are 
cumbersome,  expensive,  and  impractical  for  in  situ  process  diagnostics  on  commercial  tools.  Most  recently,  quantum 

416    Proc. of SPIE Vol. 5339 
 

cascade  lasers  have  been  developed  to  produce  single-mode  mid-infrared  radiation  at  near-room  temperature 
maintainable by Péltier coolers. The latter lasers are only now approaching markets.  

Our goal is to meet most of the diagnostic needs in nano- and micro-scale fabrication technologies with a single, robust, 
cost-effective sensor that will enable the diagnostics-assisted process with continuous refined optimization, temperature 
and  contamination  control,  and  improved  reproducibility  and  reliability.  The  basic  hardware  includes  a  diode  laser,  a 
photodiode, two mirrors and a mirror piezo-mount. Modulation and registration electronics do not have to be adjacent to 
the plasma chamber.  
 
2.2 Measurements of excited and metastable atom densities and temperature  

Details of driving mechanisms in plasma reactors for fabrication of microelectronics are not fully known even in the case 
of argon plasma. At pressures between 10 Pa and 10 kPa, metastable atoms play an important role in stepwise excitation 
and  ionization  processes50,51  but  direct  ionization  often  dominates  in  argon  plasmas  at  lower  and  higher  pressures.52,53  
Mechanisms  vary  depending  on  regime  of  plasma  operation.  Therefore,  continuing  efforts  on  plasma  diagnostics  are 
warranted.   

Diode lasers have been actively used for measuring densities of metastable and emitting excited states of neutral or ionic 
species  of  argon,  krypton  and  xenon.54-60    In  addition,  they  have  been  successfully  used  for  determination  of  the  gas 
kinetic (translational) temperature in the rare gas plasmas.52,55-61  Concentrations of excited atoms of chlorine, fluorine 
and oxygen have also been measured with diode lasers.62,63  
 Most of previous work with the diode lasers was performed using telecommunication lasers that emit a single spectral 
mode (no broader than 10-4
 nm) formed in the Fabry-Pérot cavity defined by the laser edge facets. Generally, the Fabry-
Pérot diode lasers are capricious in regard to frequent and often uncontrollable mode jumping. A single-mode tunability 
range  of  such  lasers  is  narrow  (0.03-0.3nm)  but  significantly  wider  than  Doppler  width  of  spectral  lines.  Relatively 
recently,  the  distributed  feedback  (DFB)  lasers  and  vertical  cavity  surface-emitting  lasers  (VCSEL)  have  been 
developed. The devices of both latter types can operate in a single longitudinal mode and are continuously tunable within 
one  or  several  nanometers  without  mode  jumping.  This  quality  makes  them  very  convenient  for  spectroscopic 
applications. Recent investigations64-68 have shown that VCSEL devices are especially  advantageous due to their wide 
tunability, good linearity and fast response.   
 

3. EXPERIMENTAL 

 
The immediate objective of this work was to demonstrate the extent of ease in deriving the important plasma parameters 
by  means  of  a  miniature  diode  laser.  We  used  a  VCSEL  diode  (Specdilas  V-770,  Laser  Components  GmbH)  for 
absorption  profiling  at  the  763.51-nm  argon  line.  The  experiments  resulted  in  line-of-sight  integrated  values  of  the 
temperature of argon metastable atoms in the center of the discharge. Our plasma reactor69 was a modified (inductive) 
Gaseous  Electronics  Conference  (GEC)  reference  cell  with  a  grounded  bottom  electrode.  Plasmas  in  argon  and 
argon/nitrogen mixtures were investigated. The feed gas flow rate was fixed at 8 cm3/min. Pressure was varied from 0.5 
to 67 Pa. Incident RF power applied was 100 or 300 W with reflected portion below 1%.

No absorption enhancement in a reflective cavity was necessary for this purpose. Neither mirrors nor piezo-mounts were 
installed. A laser beam passed through standard quartz windows of the GEC cell (Fig. 1). A 0.3-meter SpectraPro 300i 
spectrometer (Acton Research) and SpectruMM back-illuminated  CCD  camera  (Roper  Scientific)  were  used  instead  of  a 
photodiode, so that we were able to obtain absorption and emission data from plasma simultaneously. The entrance slit 
of the spectrometer was 50 µm for emission registration but was wide open (0.5 mm) during absorption measurements.   

The SpectraPro spectrometer and CCD camera were used to resolve emission spectra for our current research purpose 
but  they  would  be  unnecessary  for  industrial  process  diagnostics.  A  photodiode  with  an  optical  filter  is  sufficient  for 
absorption measurements as spectral resolution in this case is determined by the spectral width of laser radiation, which 
is very narrow (1×10-5 nm with the laser we used).  
The diode laser was repeatedly scanned across the argon line at 763.51 nm by changing its case temperature from 29º to 
23º C at constant anode current 4.9 mA. Optical power of the laser was about 0.4 mW. Power density was in the range of 
0.3–5 mW/cm2 and varied due to beam divergence as it propagated through the plasma volume. Only the central portion 
of  the  beam  was  recorded.  Dimensions  of  the  recorded  part  were  limited  vertically  by  2  to  10  pixels  of  the  detector 
(0.05–0.24 mm) and 0.5 mm horizontally by the spectrometer entrance slit. No axial (vertical) or lateral spatial profiles 
across  the  plasma  reactor  were  attempted  at  this  time.  To  facilitate  wavelength  calibration,  low-finesse  étalon  fringes 
from an ordinary 11-mm thick quartz "window" were simultaneously recorded by a silicon photodiode (see Fig. 2).  

For each laser scan, absorption data is first calibrated versus time by use of the étalon trace. Etalon maxima and minima 
are extracted by performing a quadratic fit in the vicinity of each extremum. The fringe points versus time are then fit to 
a  fourth  order  polynomial  approximation  to  extract  laser  wavelength  versus  time.  This  fitting  procedure  was 
independently verified by comparison to ambient-air oxygen absorption lines (Fig. 2) and readings of the spectrometer 
calibrated against the argon/mercury lamp spectrum. The uncertainty in relative wavelength calibration from this method 
is estimated at < 4% and is less than the overall error in the data obtained. The absorption profile of the argon line is fit 
with a quadratic baseline correction for modulation of the absolute laser intensity in the vicinity of the absorption. At low 
pressure (<100 Pa) and low electron density (~1011cm-3), collisional broadening is expected to be small. Fits attempted 
with  a  Voigt  lineshape  indicated  a  negligible  Lorentzian  component  and  produced  nearly  identical  fits  to  the  Doppler 
profiles.  The  gas  kinetic  temperature  is  then  extracted  from  the  half-width  at  half-maximum  (HWHM)  of  the  line 
broadening obtained in the Doppler fit:

where λ0 is the wavelength of the argon line (763.51 nm), c is the speed of light, mAr is mass of argon atom, and k is 
Boltzmann  constant.  The  reported  temperature  values  represent  the  average  of  4–8  consecutive  scans.  The  standard 
deviations  due  to  random  scatter  varied by  15  to  60  K depending  on  experimental  conditions. However,  based  on  the 
standard deviation of the fit parameters, the temperature would typically be accurate to within a few Kelvin degrees and 
thus, precision could be improved.  
The rotational temperature is extracted from fitting the (0,0) vibrational transition of the 2nd positive system (C3Πu–B3Πg) 
of  N2.  The  fit  procedure  described  previously,70  is  applied  here  using  the  spectral  constants  of  Roux  et  al.71  and 
Hamiltonian  of  Brown  and  Merer,72  with  the  lambda  doubling  constants  removed  (as  this  effect  is  well  below  the 
resolution of the spectrometer). The differences between synthetic spectra and experimental spectra are then minimized 
with respect to intensity and rotational and vibrational temperatures. Several overlapping argon lines are also accounted 
for in the fit. The errors for rotational temperature reflect the standard deviation in the parameters from the minimization 
procedure.  When  multiple  spectra  were  collected  and  fit  under  the  same  conditions,  the  results  were  found  to  agree 
within this error. 
 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
The argon line at 763.51 nm is very close to the molecular oxygen line  PQ9 of the (0,0) b1Σg–X3Σg transition at 763.52 
nm. Hence, we conveniently used the rotational structure of ambient atmospheric oxygen for verification of wavelength 
calibration. Oxygen absorption was barely seen in most of our experiments when the spectrometer entrance was facing 
directly the plasma reactor window. The two absorption traces presented in Fig. 2 were recorded at increased pathlength 
(total 4 m) of the laser beam passing through air between plasma reactor and detector. One of the traces was scanned 
slower, the other was faster. The latter scan captured five oxygen lines starting from the longer wavelengths (PP9, PQ9, 

418    Proc. of SPIE Vol. 5339 
 

PP7, PQ7, PP5) and touched a wing of the PQ5 line at the shortest wavelength of the scan. Wavelengths and wavenumbers 
of these lines along with the argon line are listed in Table 1 (spectroscopic data for oxygen is from Cheah et al.73).   
Additionally, Fig. 2 depicts the low-finesse étalon fringe that was utilized for routine wavelength calibration. We used 
one of the higher transverse modes formed in the optical leg between the étalon, a quartz beam splitter, and a photodiode 
in order to avoid excessive modulation observed in the TEM00 mode as a result of interfering reflections from the front 
window of the GEC cell. A fringe period (free spectral range of the étalon) at the higher transverse mode is smaller than 
that in the TEM00 mode. However, some long-period modulation because of the reflections at the GEC cell window can 
still be noticed in this higher mode fringe (see Fig. 2). The intensity of the laser output was increasing slightly as it was 
cooled down by Péltier thermoelectric modules during the scans.

Emission intensity at several argon lines was recorded as a function of pressure in the pure argon discharge at 100 W of 
incident  power.  These  intensities  normalized  at  the  magnitude  of  their  maxima  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  3.  At  lower 
pressures,  emission  increases  with  pressure  because  both  argon  and  electron  densities  increase.  Then  after  reaching  a 
maximum, emission decreases because the electron temperature (and the excitation rate) decreases at higher pressures. 
The higher the energy of the upper level of the emitting line, the more sensitive this line is to the decrease in electron 
temperature, i.e. its emission maximum shifted to lower pressure. An estimate of the electron temperature can be inferred 
from  measurements  of  relative  intensities  of  highly  excited  argon  lines  as  their  excitation  temperature74.  At  our 
experimental  conditions,  the  electron  temperature  was  between  20000  and  52000  K  (2–4.5  eV)  in  argon  plasma69. 
Electrons  cannot  effectively  heat  the  heavy  particles  (atoms  and  ions)  and  hence,  the  gas  kinetic  temperature  remains 
about two orders of magnitude lower. No information on the gas temperature can be obtained from low-resolution atomic 
emission  data,  such  as  presented  in  Fig.  3.  However,  it  is  the  gas  temperature  that  is  one  of  the  most  important 
parameters in material processing on industrial plasma tools.

Line-of-sight integrated number densities of metastable argon atoms as measured by diode laser absorption at 763.51 nm 
are  shown  in  Fig.  4  depending  on  pressure  in  100%-argon  and  nitrogen/argon  mixtures.  Absorption  pathlength  was 
assumed  equal  to  the  plasma  reactor  internal  diameter  of  25  cm.  The  glowing  part  of  the  plasma  with  high  electron 
density is limited roughly by the diameter of the induction coil (10 cm) but the metastable atoms diffuse from the center 
and decay on the walls. A small portion of the metastables might protrude even farther into the window ports of the GEC 
cell  (additional  distance  of  12.5  cm  toward  the  windows  on  each  side  of  the  plasma  reactor).  The  latter  portion  was

neglected in calculation of metastable number densities. The effects of stimulated radiation and fluorescence were also 
neglected. 

At lower pressures, there is no significant difference within random scatter between metastable argon densities in pure 
argon and 3% nitrogen/argon mixture. At higher pressures, metastable argon densities are lower when nitrogen is added. 
Apparently, this is because of reduction in electron density resulting from nitrogen introduction and the higher rate of 
argon quenching by nitrogen molecules than by argon itself. The dependence on pressure of the metastable atoms should, 
in principle, be similar to that of the emitting atoms (see Fig. 3). A maximum of the metastable density on the pressure 
scale was not observed here because we did not probe pressures below 0.5 Pa. A comparison of data in Figures 3 and 4 
indicates that the bulk of argon plasma emission is largely determined by stepwise excitation (from the metastable states) 
and cascade transitions from higher states rather than by direct excitation from the ground state. Only the very highly 
excited emitting Ar atoms behave somewhat similar to the metastables, e.g. the line at 602.5 nm that originates from the 
energy level at 123882.20 cm-1 (30738.44 cm-1 above the lowest metastable level at 93143.76 cm-1). 
Nitrogen  added  in  argon plays  at  lower pressures  a  simple  dilution role.  The  number density  of Ar metastables  in  the 
45% N2 / 55% Ar mixture at 2.7 Pa was approximated as 7.8×109 cm-3, which is exactly 5.5 times higher than 1.4×109 
cm-3 measured in the 90% N2 / 10% Ar mixture at the same pressure and power (see Fig. 4). However, the metastable 
argon density in the 90% N2 / 10% Ar mixture was more that 3 times lower than the density which would be determined 
by a dilution factor when compared to the 45% N2 / 55% Ar mixture at 13.6 Pa. This is again because of quenching of 
argon metastables by nitrogen molecules that becomes more frequent as pressure increases. 

The  results  of  the  gas  temperature  determination  from  Doppler  broadened  profiles  of  argon  absorption  and  from 
rotational  spectra  of  the  molecular  nitrogen  emission  are  shown  in  Figures  5  and  6.  All  species  in  the  plasma  except 
electrons are assumed to be in translational equilibrium at the gas kinetic temperature. Experimentally derived rotational 
and Doppler data resulted in effective temperature values, integrated over the line of sight and weighted by the spatial 
density distributions. These distributions were different for different species. Obviously, the emitting nitrogen molecules 
existed only in the glowing part of the plasma, while the metastable argon atoms had a broader distribution filling out the 
dark space near the reactor walls. Thus, the Doppler broadening measurements yield an average gas temperature in the 
plasma chamber, while the rotational temperature characterizes the gas temperature only within the RF power load area.

Doppler  temperatures  obtained  from  100%  argon  and  3%  N2/Ar  mixture  were  almost  identical  (Fig.  5)  with  the 
temperature  in  3%  N2/Ar  mixture  being  seemingly  slightly  lower  but  the  distinction  was  insignificant  at  our 
measurement  scatter.  Out  of  the  three  nitrogen/argon  mixtures  tested,  the  45%  N2/Ar  mixture  exhibited  the  hottest 
rotational temperature reaching 1285 K at 300 W at higher pressure (Fig. 6). Note that the same rotational data for 3% 
N2/Ar mixture at 300 W is plotted in both Figures 5 and 6 to facilitate comparison. 
The  nitrogen  rotational  temperature  is  observed  to  increase  with  pressure  and  power.  This  rise  in  temperature  with 
pressure is generally expected in inductively coupled plasmas as gas heating mechanisms involved are proportional to 
electron-neutral and ion-neutral collision rates, while the dominant cooling mechanisms are only weakly dependent on 
pressure.75  However, at large nitrogen concentrations (45, 90%) there are sudden jumps in temperature at 3.5 Pa (100 W, 
45%  N2)  and  21  Pa  (300  W,  90%  N2)  that  are  associated  with  a  plasma  mode  transition  from  inductive  to  capacitive 
coupling (see Fig. 5, 6). This plasma  mode change is visually apparent as a dimming of the plasma, and is associated

with a sharp (order of magnitude) decrease in electron density. The reduction in electron density is accompanied by a 
reduction  in  electron-neutral  impact  frequency  and  therefore  a  drop  in  temperature.  However,  for  the  case  of  100  W 
power, the rotational temperature actually increases upon change into capacitive mode, and remains constant as pressure 
is increased.  This likely results from a non-thermal means of populating the emitting C3Πu state of N2.76  It is possible 
for metastable states of argon to transfer energy to ground state nitrogen, thereby populating the C3Πu state:

It has been found that this process results in an elevated rotational temperature in the C3Πu state of N2.  The C3Πu–B3Πg 
emission  then  can  be  attributed  to  two  different  processes,  one  that  does  not  alter  the  energy  distribution  (electron 
impact)  and  one  that  does  (excitation  transfer  from  metastable  argon).  To  determine  whether  or  not  the  measured 
rotational temperature is valid, we estimated the relative contribution of each excitation mechanism. From the excitation 
transfer cross sections76 one can estimate the rate of reaction (2) to be:

with Te in eV.  For most our conditions, r2 is orders of magnitude larger than r1 and reaction (2) can be considered to be 
negligible.  In  the  case  of  Bochkova  and  Chernysheva,76  the  first  reaction  was  found  to  be  important  in  the  nitrogen 
afterglow where electron densities and temperatures are low. In our experiments in the capacitive mode at 100 W, this 
process  may  be  important  enough  to  impact  the  temperature  measurement.  More  comprehensive  measurements, 
including  spatially  resolved  electron  densities  and  temperatures  would  be  required  to  ascertain  whether  or  not  this 
process was truly important at our conditions. 

The  standard  deviations  of  data  from  Doppler  broadening  measurements  are  shown  in  Figures  5  and  6.  The  standard 
deviations of rotational temperature data are omitted for clarity. Typically, random fluctuations of the deduced rotational 
temperature values were within 1-2% but were the largest (up to ±50 K) at lower pressures for the 3% nitrogen/argon 
mixture. Overall accuracy of the rotational temperature determination was estimated as limited by ±50 K and was better 
at higher pressures. 

At pressures below 4 Pa, all temperature values measured at 100 W in pure argon and nitrogen/argon mixtures up to 45% 
N2 agree well within experimental uncertainties (Fig. 5). The same is true for pressures below 2 Pa at 300 W (Fig. 6). 
This is also in agreement with Hebner,78 who found no influence of nitrogen addition to argon plasma (up to 50% N2) on 
gas temperature at 1.3 Pa. The fact that rotational and Doppler temperatures are the same suggests high diffusion rates, 
and certain similarity in spatial profiles of both thermometric species (Ar* and N2*) at low pressures.

As  pressure  was  increased,  the  rotational  and  Doppler  data  diverged  from  each  other  indicating  more  pronounced 
variations in spatial profiles of the temperature and species. For instance, the measured Doppler temperature was 800 K

lower  than  the  rotational  temperature  at  67  Pa  in  45%  N2/Ar  mixture  (Fig.  6).  This  discrepancy  is  attributable  to  the 
differences in spatial profiles of the thermometric species and therefore, to the differences in effective pathlength, over 
which temperature was integrated in our experiments.  

The origin of discrepancies between measured Doppler and rotational temperatures, attributed to higher spatial gradients 
in metastable argon atom density at higher pressures, is corroborated by the results of the 0-D simulation of argon plasma 
(see  Fig.  5).  The  model  included  direct  ionization  and  excitation  by  fast  electrons,  ion-neutral  charge  exchange, 
ambipolar diffusion, stepwise ionization, Penning ionization and quenching by electrons and atoms. This model does not 
predict a local minimum in the pressure dependence of the gas temperature observed around 20 Pa in 100% argon and 
3% N2/Ar mixtures for both rotational and Doppler temperatures (Fig. 5). If there were no changes in radial profiles, the 
gas  temperature  would  be  increasing  monotonically  with  pressure  as  frequency  of  elastic  collisions  and  ion-to-neutral 
energy transfer rates increase but diffusion decreases.  

Further proof of influence of metastable atom spatial distributions in our plasma reactor on the line-of-sight integrated 
temperature  was  obtained  with  two-dimensional  plasma  simulation.  The  radial  profiles  of  gas  temperature  and 
metastable argon atoms resulting from the 2-D plasma simulation for a set of pressures and RF powers are plotted versus 
reactor radius in Figures 7 and 8. Within the range of the simulated conditions (1 - 40 Pa, 100 - 300 W, 100% Ar) the gas 
temperature  profiles  were  all  fairly  similar  (see  Fig.  7).  However,  the  metastable  argon  atom  profiles  were  changing 
significantly. At low pressures about 1 Pa, the metastable argon density was maximum in the reactor center. As pressure 
and power increased, the gas temperature also increased causing depletion of the gas density in the center. Consequently, 
a higher fraction of metastable argon atoms was pushed out of the center toward the reactor walls (see Fig. 8). Vertical 
dashed lines in Figures 7 and 8 indicate the position of the outer edge of the induction coil.  

Apparently,  at  low  pressures  the  spatial  profiles  of  both  thermometric  species  (metastable  argon  atoms  and  excited 
nitrogen molecules) have somewhat similar spatial profiles, and thus they yield the same experimental gas temperature 
values.  At  higher  pressure,  the  excited  nitrogen  remains  within  the  glowing  area,  while  metastable  argon  redistributes 
significantly and may form local maxima near the reactor wall. Moreover, it might protrude into the window ports of the 
GEC  cell  that  were  not  included  in  the  simulated  reactor  geometry.  As  a  result,  the  measured  Doppler  temperature  is 
lower that the rotational temperature at higher pressures.  

The  effective  temperature  values  (radial-integrated  and  weighted  by  the  metastable  argon  density)  resulting  from  2-D 
plasma simulation are presented in Fig. 9 in dependence on pressure at 100 and 300 W loaded RF power. Also, the radial-
averaged  densities  of  metastable  argon  atoms  are  shown.  This  simulation  has  captured  the  correct  trend  in  metastable 
densities  but  does  not  resemble  correctly  the  experimental  gas  temperature  behavior.  Probably,  the  dead  space  in  the 
reactor window ports that may be filled by metastable argon atoms must be added into the simulation to provide results 
that  would  be  closer  to  reality.  However,  the  latter  task  requires  a  three-dimensional  model.  Absolute  values  of  the 
simulated temperature and densities do not agree well with the experimental data.

Fig. 9. Simulated gas temperature and metastable atom density in Ar plasma. 

 

Argon absorption recorded throughout our experimental conditions was between 4.5 and 98%. It was the weakest in 90% 
N2  /  10%  Ar  mixture  and  the  strongest  in  100%  argon  plasma.  Since  significantly  lower  absorption  can  be  reliably 
measured, small concentrations of argon can always be added to any plasma environment without altering conditions but

broadening of their absorption determined. Therefore, excited argon atoms can be used as thermometric species in a wide 
variety of applications.  

Present work indicates the importance of three-dimensional spatial resolution for determining gas temperature gradients in 
plasma  reactors.  This  can be  achieved by  measuring  laser  induced fluorescence.  The diode  laser  induced fluorescence 
was  previously  used  for  analytical  purposes.10-13    Combined  with  absorption  measurements,  it  can  provide  spatially 
resolved absolute densities of species and temperature in the plasma. The plasma chamber should then incorporate three 
windows (one for the diode laser and two for detection photodiodes). The precise tuning capability of the diode lasers 
determines very high spectral resolution in fluorescence as well as in absorption. No sophisticated optical equipment is 
required.   

Once  understanding  of  spatial  distributions  of  various  species  inside  the  plasma  reactor  is  realized,  it  is  possible  to 
construe  a  correlation  between  measured  line-of-sight  temperature  values  derived  from  several  different  thermometric 
species and an actual spatial temperature profile. Our work provides an example of determination of the gas temperature 
only in the central glowing part of the plasma by measuring the nitrogen temperature and an average gas temperature by 
measuring  the  argon  metastable  temperature.  The  difference  in  these  two  values  is  indicative  of  the  temperature 
distribution over the reactor volume. An advantage of this approach is simpler hardware requirements in comparison to 
fluorescence, i.e. only two windows necessary.  

Our  further  research  will  be  focused  on  determination  of  species  in  material  processing  plasmas  by  continuous-wave 
cavity ring-down spectroscopy. Only a few recent research papers have dealt with CRDS in various plasmas.79-82  None 
of  them  were  applied  in  a  cw  mode  (generally  more  sensitive  with  higher  spectral  resolution  as  compared  to  the 
conventional pulsed CRDS), nor used the diode lasers that are compact and inexpensive. The detection limit for CnHm 
radicals  is  estimated  at  ~109  cm-3;  and  at  ~1011  cm-3  for  CFX  radicals.40    This  level  of  sensitivity  is  sufficient  for 
diagnostic applications in plasma-based processing.   
 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

 
Application  of  a  miniature  diode  laser  based  sensor  for  determination  of  the  gas  temperature  inside  an  inductively 
coupled  plasma  reactor  was  demonstrated.  The  results  were  compared  to  rotational  temperature  determination  at  the 
same  conditions  and  to  the  gas  temperature  calculated  using  a  2-D  model.  These  comparisons  revealed  strongly  non-
uniform and variable thermal spatial distributions depending on conditions.  

The  thermometric  species  used  in  this  study  were  metastable  argon  atoms  and  nitrogen  molecules.  In  principle,  any 
species  with  absorption  features  within  the  tunability  range  of  the  available  laser  can  serve  as  thermometric. 
Alternatively,  a  small  concentration  of  argon  added  to  any  other  plasma  will  not  alter  the  process  but  enable  the  gas 
temperature determination by argon absorption.  

The multiplexing diode laser based absorption, enhanced in a modulated high-reflectivity optical resonator is suggested 
as an ideal and almost universal technique for acquisition of the real-time in situ multi-parametric data (species densities 
and  temperature),  which  makes  it  possible  to  determine  absolute  concentrations  of  atoms  or  radicals  and  their 
temperature,  thus  providing  a  single,  simple,  compact,  and  inexpensive  tool  to  optimize  and  control  reproducible 
micro/nano-fabrication processes with active sensor-driven feedback. A laser beam can be adjusted to analyze the local 
reactions occurring in the vicinity of the designed nano-scale features.  

In principle, sharp three-dimensional spatial resolution can be achieved with this technology if laser induced fluorescence 
is  recorded  simultaneously.  Excellent  spectral  resolution  is  determined  by  the  spectral  width  of  laser  radiation  (below 
1×10-4 nm).  
Precision of temperature measurements can be further perfected to a few Kelvin. The lower limits for determination of 
CnHm radicals by enhanced absorption in a modulated optical cavity are estimated at ~109 cm-3; and for CFX radicals at 
~1011 cm-3.

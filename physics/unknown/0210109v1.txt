Abstract    Salam  hypothesis  pointed  out  quantum  mechanical  cooperative  and  condensation 
phenomena may give rise to a second order phase transition below a critical temperature linking 
the transformation of D-amino acids to L-amino acids due to parity-violating energy differences. 
The  previous  experimental  verification  of  this  phenomenon  has  not  proved  successfully.  Chiral 
molecules are characterized by a specific rotation angle. Here we present an experimental method 
to  dissect  the  optical  rotation  angle  with  the  molecular  chirality  of  D-alanine,  L-alanine  and 
DL-alanine. The measurement of the temperature-dependent optical rotation angle, the differential 
specific  heat  and  DC-Magnetic  susceptibilities  between  D-  and  L-alanine  provided  the  direct 

evidence  of  predicted  phase  transition,  but  denied  the  transformation  of  D→L.  New  views  on 
Salam phase transition are presented to recover its great importance in the origin of homochirality.

1. Introduction 
 

Two  recently  published  papers  by  Bonner[1]  and  Keszthelyi[2]  have  discussed  the 
extraterrestrial  origin  of  the  homochirality  of  biomolecules  and  the  amplification  of  tiny 
enantiomeric  excess.  Attention  is  called  upon  the  mechanism  for  production  of  extraterrestrial 
handedness  based  on  Salam’s  phase  transition.  Salam[3][4]postulated  that  chirality  among  the 
twenty amino acids which make up the proteins may be a consequence of a phase transition which 
is analogous to that due to BCS superconductivity. Salam suggested a unique mechanism whereby 
the  parity  violating  energy  difference  (PVED)  between  D-  and  L-enantiomers  of  amino  acids 
might  lead  directly  to  a  homochiral  product.  He  postulated  that  there  exists  an  abrupt  phase 
transition  at  a  critical  temperature,  Tc,  causing  a  change  in  the  chirality  of  D-amino  acid  to 
L-amino acid. Salam proposed the following way to test his hypothesis: 
        The  first  way  to  test  for  evidence  of  the  hypothesis  (regarding  the  existence  of  a  phase 
transition)  is  to  lower  the  temperature  while  measuring  the  optical  activity  of  a  crystalline 
DL-alanine, L-alanine or D-alanine, when polarized light is shone upon a particular amino acid. If 
the polarization vector gets rotated, one may be sure that the appropriate phase transition has taken 
place. The second way of detecting the process may be by measuring differences of specific heats 
and looking for anomalies in the curve C = γ T + β T 3 +…like Mizutani et al. [5] have done for the 
non-amino acids like melanins and tumor melanosomes. Note that ideally Salam would be able to 
compute the values of Tc    when electroweak interaction is fully worked out. The analogy of the 
“superfluidity”  exhibited  by  amino  acids  is  to  “superfluidity”  in  superconductors.  In  the  case  of 

 

1 

superconductivity, the third way for a given amino acid is to apply an external magnetic field and 
look for the Meissner effect to determine Tc .   
        Figureau  et  al.  [6][7]  conducted  a  series  of  experiments  to  test  the  validity  of  Salam’s 
predictions. They observed no changes in optical rotation after exposing both racemic DL-cystine 
and  L-cystine  to  temperatures  ranging  from  77K  to  0.6K  for  three  and  four  days,  thus  reported 
failing  to  validate  PVED-induced  phase  transitions  predicted  by  Salam.  However,  in  Figureau 
experiments, after the cooling period the samples were taken out of the cryostat, then heated and 
dissolved in HCl solution at room temperature. Therefore, their observing no optical rotation only 
proves that Salam phase transition is not an irreversible process, but it is not a piece of negative 
evidence while the transition is reversible. Furthermore, their work only denied the configuration 
change of D to L, but based upon our previous studies[8][9][10], we found that Salam’s hypothesis on 
this  phase  transition  has  to  be  revised  for  it  may  merely  play  as  an  amplification  mechanism 
instead  of  a  final  configuration  change  that  Salam  originally  suggested,  so  the  on-line 
measurement  of  optical  rotation  angle  is  necessary  for  the  DL-alanine,  D-alanine  and  L-alanine 
crystal from ambient to below Tc. 
        The  rotation  of  plane–polarized  light  by  a  crystal  of  chiral  molecules  arises  from  the 
difference in the index of refraction for left and right circularly polarized light. It is probed at a 
single  frequency  in  polarimetry  measurements  of  the  rotation  angle.  The  angle  depends  on  the 
chemical bonding and molecular conformation in a molecule. Here we present the experiments to 
determine  the  temperature-dependent  optical  rotation  angle  of  D-alanine,  L-alanine  and  DL- 
alanine of known crystalline structure under the variation of temperature. 

 

2. Experimental 
 

2.1 Characterization of samples 
       The powder of D-alanine, L-alanine and DL-alanine were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. 
The amino acids single crystals were well-formed crystals elongated along the c axis, which were 

grown  by  slow  evaporation  of  saturated  aqueous  solutions  at  4°C,  then  washed  with  absolute 
alcohol, evacuated and kept in a desiccator. The characterization of D- and L-alanine crystals was 
performed  by  the  element  analysis  (C,  H  and  N)  and  X-ray  structure  analysis.  It  indicates  that 
D-alanine and L-alanine are pure single crystals containing no crystal water. The crystal structure 
of  D-  and  L-  alanine  are  orthorhombic  with  the  same  space  group  P212121,  Z=4,  with  lattice 
constants a = 6.0344(5) Å, b = 12.3668(7) Å, c = 5.7879(4) Å, α = β= γ = 90°, which agrees with 
Simpson’s  data[11].  The  rotation  angle  ζ  of  the  D-  and  L-  alanine  solution  was  measured  on 
Polarimeter PE-241MC with the wavelength of 589.6 nm at 293K. By using the formula of [ α] = 
ζ / (L+C), the corresponding α values of D- and L-alanine were shown to be the enantiomer.   
 
2.2 Temperature dependence of optical rotation angle measurements 

Linearly polarized light of wavelength 632.8 nm from He-Ne laser source passes through a 
transparent chiral material of length d that is located in vacuum temperature-control system. The 
direct  measurement of the polarization direction of a light beam e.g. the rotation signal must be 
converted into an amplitude signal with the aid of a polarization-optical analyzer. Wollaston prism 
is a beam splitter that splits the linearly polarized light beam into two component beams polarized 
normal to each other. Because the maximum sensitivity and linearity of measurement are obtained 

 

2 

by  adjusting  an  angle  of  45°  between  the  analyzer  and  the  initial  plane  of  polarization,  the 
component beam intensities J1    and    J2      are    measured by two highly accurate photodetectors by 
adjusting the transmitting direction of the Wollaston prism to be ± 45°(Fig.1, Fig.2)     
                              J1 = J0    cos2 (45°-ϕ) = J0    (1 + sin 2 ϕ ) / 2                              (1) 
                              J2 = J0    cos2 (45°+ϕ) = J0    (1 − sin 2 ϕ ) / 2                              (2)   
                              J1 − J2 / J1 + J2    = sin 2 ϕ                                                            (3) 
                              ϕ = 1/2 arc sin (J1 − J2 / J1 + J2)                                                  (4) 
Here J0 is the intensity in front of the analyzer, J1 and J2 is the light intensity behind the analyzer, 
respectively[12]. In the experiments the overall accuracy is ± 0.01° .

Fig.2 Resolution of electric vector through Wollaston prism 

The  temperature-dependent  optical  rotation  angles  of  DL-alanine,  D-alanine  and  L-alanine 
crystal  have  been  measured  in  the  temperature  region  from  230K  to  300K.  The  crystals  were 
pre-located  in  the  vacuum  temperature-control  sets,  and  the  beam  intensity  J1    and    J2    was 
measured by two independent highly accurate photodetectors. The optical rotation angle ϕ (degree) 
was calculated by equation (1) to (4) and the data were shown in Fig. 3 to 5. 

The optical rotation angle ϕ is defined as 

   
                            ϕ L    = 2 π nL d /λ                                                                            (5) 
                            ϕ D    = 2 π nD d /λ                                                                            (6)

                            ϕ = 1/2 (ϕ L−ϕ D) = π (nL −nD) d /λ                                                  (7) 

Here  nL  and  nD are  the  refraction  index  of  L-alanine  and  D-alanine;  d  is  the  thickness  of 
measuring  crystals; λ  is  the  wavelength.  The  structures  of  DL-alanine,  D-alanine  and  L-alanine 
belong to the orthorhombic system, but the space group is P212121 for the D- (or L-) alanine and 
Pna21 for the DL-alanine respectively[13]. So the optical rotation angle ϕ DL is not equal to the sum 
of ϕ D plus ϕL from the Figs.3 to 5.

Fig. 5 Temperature-dependent optical rotation angle of D-alanine 

The temperature-dependent optical rotation angle of DL-alanine was shown in Fig.3. The ϕ 
value is equal to − 0.50° (approach to zero) from 290K to 260K. It proves that DL-alanine is truly 
racemic.  When  the  temperature  continuously  decreases  from  260K  pass  through  250K  to  230K, 

the ϕ  value  is  rapidly  decreasing  to  −  4.50°  showing  an  obvious  characteristic  phase  transition. 
The temperature-dependent optical rotation angle of L-alanine was shown in Fig. 4. The ϕ value is 
equal to 169°∼ 170° from 290K to 230K. There is no obvious change of optical rotation existed in 
L-alanine. In contrast, D-alanine presents an obvious optical rotation at a maximum − 4° in the ϕ 
∼  T  curve  around  260K  and  appears  a  sinusoidal  transformation  (Fig.5).  It  seems  that  a  crucial 
form of the transition temperature Tc involves dynamical symmetrical breaking (Salam, 1992)   
                 

3. Results and Discussion 
 

3.1 Evidence of a second order phase transition by DSC and SQUID 

The  temperature  dependence  of  the  specific  heats  of  D-/L  alanine  (D-/L-valine)  had  been 
measured  by  DSC  (differential  scanning  calorimetry)  with  adiabatic  continuous  heating  in  the 

temperature region from 77K to 300K. It was found that an obvious λ phase transition around 260 
K existed in D-alanine and D-valine. The experimental results were repeated for the same samples 

after several thermal cycles from 77K↔300K. The shape and magnitude of the specific heat jump 
and the peak position were almost the same for the different cycles[8].   

Magnetic  moment  (m)  and  magnetic  susceptibility  (χρ)  of  D-/  L-alanine  crystals  were 
measured by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-5) from 200K to 300K at a field 
of  1.0T  (with  differential  sensitivity  1E-8  emu  to  1  Tesla).  Magnetization  measurements  have 
shown  alanine  enantiomers  to  be  dimagnetic,  since  they  have  even  numbers  of  electrons  which 
form  closed  magnetically  neutral  shells.  When  the  temperature  falls  below  240K,  D-alanine 
undergoes a magnetic phase transition as the χρ    values showed a maximum near 240K and then 
went down, while χρ    values of L -alanine go on increasing slowly and its mechanism is clearly 
distinct  with  that  of  D-alanine  crystal.  The  experimental  results  are  repeatable  for  the  same 
samples after several thermal circles from 200K to 300K, and both the magnitudes of χρ    values 
and the transition temperatures of D-alanine crystal are almost the same for the different thermal

3.2 Optical Rotation angle as a probe of molecular chirality 
         Based  upon  the  present  results  we  found  that  a  phase  transition  related  with  the  optical 
rotation  change  in  D-alanine  and  DL-alanine  is  existed  as  Salam  predicted.  The  rotation  of 
plane-polarized light by chiral molecules arises from the difference in the index of refraction for 
left  and  right  circularly  polarized  light.  The  rotation  angle  depends  on  chemical  bonding  and 
molecular conformation.   

        The  optical  rotation  parameterα,β  is  related  to  the  angular  frequency  of  the  incident 

radiation (ω) and the elements of the electric dipole and magnetic dipole, which can be written 
down as:

is  the  associated  excitation  frequency.  Hereµand  m  are  the 

electric  and  magnetic  dipole  operators.  N  means  the  total  number  of  atoms  in  a  unit  volume.  L 
denotes the length of light pass,  h is Plank constant and c is the light velocity. 
        This equation induced by Rosenfeld using quantum mechanics shows that the interference of 
the  electric  dipole  and  magnetic  dipole  produces  the  optical  rotation  effect  in  optical  active 
medium. To perform this calculation on alanine crystal, not only the contributions of single atoms 
should  be  included,  but  also  all  the  chemical  bonds  and  the  molecular  conformation  must  be 
considered.  T.  B.  Freedman[14]  proposed  a  model  via  vibrationally  generated  electronic  ring 
currents  to  explain  the  optical  rotation  effect.  In  the  case  of  alanine  crystal,  the  Cα−H  stretch 
generates an oscillating electronic current in a molecular ring, adjacent to the methine bond, which 
is closed by hydrogen bonding. This oscillating ring current gives rise to a large magnetic dipole 
transition moment. As depicted in Fig. 6 for the Cα−H contraction (or lengthening ) in D-alanine, 
positive (or negative) current flowing in the direction N Cα when electrons are injected into the 
ring by the Cα−H contraction (or lengthening), produces a magnetic dipole transition moment, m, 
with  a  component  in  the  direction  of  the  electric  dipole  transition  momentµ.  The  rotational 
strength  R=  Im  ( µ • m),  is  positive  (or  negative),  as  observed  experimentally  .The  main 

difference  between  enantiomers  lies  in  that  they  produce  opposite  optical  rotation  due  to  the 
opposite sign of Im (µ • m).

3.3 Discussion of the phase transition mechanism 
3.3.1 Temperature dependent X-ray diffraction data 

In 1993, Figureau et al. conducted a series of scrupulously performed experiments to test the 
validity of Salam’s predictions. They observed no change in optical rotation after exposing both 
racemic  DL-cystine  and  L-cystine  to  temperature  ranging  from  77K  to  0.6K  for  three  and  four 
days, thus reported failing to validate PVED-induced phase transitions predicted by Salam. 
In  addition to  their  experiments,  a  more  direct  way  to testify  Salam’s  phase transition  is  to 
 
conduct temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction or neutron diffraction on alanine enantiomers. If 
there is a configuration change of D- to L-, it will be easy to catch this phenomenon for an abrupt 
change in atom coordinates will be observed.

The data for D-/L- alanine single crystals are listed in Table 1, which are collected at different 
temperatures  on  a  Siemens  R3m/V  diffractometer  with  Mo--Kx  (λ=0.71073Å)  radiation.  The 
structure is solved by direct methods and subsequent Fourier Differential Techniques, and refined 
by  full-Matrix  least  squares  using  the  SHELXTL  PLUS  program.  All  non-hydrogen  atoms  are 
refined with anisotropic thermal parameters. 

Dihedral angles was calculated from the atomic coordinates of O(1) O(2) C(1) C(2) H(1) of 

D- and L-alanine under the temperature dependence of X-ray diffraction data.   

The result of temperature-dependent X-ray studies shows no evidence for structural changes 
in this temperature range. Extended neutron diffraction investigation of both D- and L- alanine at 
250K  and  60K  has  been  recently  performed  at  Rutherford  Appleton  Laboratory[15],  which  also 
shows a negative answer to the predicted configuration change of D- to L-.

shows that when temperature exceeds the transition temperature Tc, the spectra of Cα−H modes at 
1305cm-1 (Cα−H bending), 2964 cm-1 (Cα−H stretching) of D-alanine show a variation in its peak 
positions  and  relative  intensity.  As  temperature  exceeds  Tc,  these  two  peaks  show  a  downward 
shift  of  about  2  cm-1  (above  1  cm-1 spectral  resolution)(Fig.7)  on  Ranishow  1000  Micro-Raman 
system.  Raman  spectra  confirm  the  existence  of  phase  transition  of  D-alanine  crystal.  Since  the 
vibrational frequencies of Cα−H bending and stretching modes are very sensitive to the change of 
electric dipole momentµ, this Raman spectra study indicates the difference of the electric dipole 
momentµ  between  two  enantiomers  when  temperature  is  below  250K.  This  result  is  of  great 

importance  to  the  understanding  of  our  temperature-dependent  optical  rotation  measurement 
result.

Raman spectra have confirmed that the phase transition can induce a change in the electric 
dipole  momentµ.  In  addition,  the  slight  variation  of  atoms’  position  and  a  change  of  dihedral 
angle  (45.32°  43.97°),  which  will  bring  the  change  in  the  magnetic  dipole  moment  m.   
Sinceµ  and m all undergo a change in their magnitude, it is natural to observe the variation of 
rotation angle in this phase transition because it is closely related to Im (µ • m).   

From Freedman’s model, we can make a sound explanation of the phenomenon observed in 
our  experiments.  The  existence  of  the  phase  transition  suggested  by  Salam  is  verified  by  our 
experiments. However, his suggestion that this phase transition will eventually change D-alanine 
to L-alanine is denied. What we intend to emphasize here is the variation of rotation angle can not 
be  simply  and  solely  interpreted  as  the  configuration  change  of  D→L.  As  we  have  already 
presented,  the  optical  rotation  is  closely  related  to  Im  (µ • m),  so  changes  of  magnitude  of  Im 
(µ • m) will also bring about this phenomenon.

3.3.4 New insight of Salam phase transition.   
 
Our  series  of  experiments  confirm  the  existence  of  a  phase  transition  in  amino  acids. 
Although Salam’s hypothesis has failed to explain homochirality only via this phase transition, the 
significance of the different behavior between D- and L- amino acids in the phase transition will 
never be ignored. The parity violation effect in weak interaction has made enantiomers different. 
Berger and Quack’s study in a detailed analysis of dynamic chirality proved that the dihedral angle 
between the O2C and Cα-H planes plays an important role in determining the intrinsic energies of 
the  alanine  molecules  and  this  difference  has  been  used  in  the  calculation  of  Parity  Violating 
Energy  Difference  (PVED)  [16].  According  to  Quack’s  theoretical  method  by  means  of  highest 
level ab initio studies (MC-LR), the PVED value is 1.2 × 10-19 Hartree (3.3× 10-18 eV/molecule), 
namely  L-alanine  is  more  stable  than  D-alanine.  D-alanine  and  L-alanine  have  shown  obvious 
difference at 250K. The most striking result that confirm this study in our X-ray diffraction is the 

apparent difference in the dihedral angle between D- and L- alanine at 250K (D:43.97°    L:45.72°) 
while  in  other  temperature  they  are  almost  the  same.  Quack  has  also  proved  that  the  difference 
between  enantiomers  induced  by  weak  neutral  currents  is  too  minor  to  be  detected  by 
experimental methods under normal conditions[17]. But as we have already illustrated, D-, L-, and 
DL-  alanine  crystals  display  distinct  behavior  in  all  experimental  methods  in  the  specific  phase 
transition  process.  A  possible  explanation  could  be:  the  minor  difference  between  D-  and  L- 
enatiomers (PVED: about 10-18 - 10-17 eV) has been enlarged to a detective level during this phase 
transition  due  to  quantum  mechanical  cooperative  and  condensation  phenomena.  This  amplified 
energy difference will become the foundation of later amplification mechanism. 

Establishing chemical systems that are thermodynamically far from equilibrium, Kondepudi 
and Nelson succeeded in simulating the evolution of dominant chirality by nonlinear analysis of 
chemical  reactions[18].  If  we  take  the  specific  phase  transition  into  consideration,  the  enlarged 
energy  difference  will  greatly  shorten  the  time  period  needed  in  their  model  to  achieve 
homochirality and it will also reduce the total number of molecules that this system must have in 
order to surmount fluctuation. What is worth emphasizing, according to Salam, the occurrence of 
Salam  phase  transition  can  enhance  the  PVED  a  lot,  which  will  in  turn  induce  much  higher 
probability  of  transition.  This  kind  of  nonlinear  feedback  relation  is  similar  with  that  in 
Kondepudi-Nelson scenario : when the PVED value is larger by one to two orders of magnitude 
than  anticipated,  the  time  required  to  realize  homochirality  in  a  100m×100m×4m  lake  reduces 
from  104  year  to  one  year[19]  [20].  In  fact,  nonlinear  effects  in  asymmetric  synthesis  and 
stereoselective  reactions  have  been  widely  discovered  and  studied[21]  [22].  A  recently  published 
experiment  showed  that  the  chiral  amplification  of  oligopeptides  in  two-dimensional  crystalline 
self-assemblies on water also introduces nonlinear effects[23]. 

Significantly,  the  biological  system  when  homochirality  was  achieved  meets  well  the 
formation  requirements  of  a  dissipative  structure  —  the  critical  transition  point  is  far  from 
equilibrium; the control parameter PVED, whose value determines the probability of Salam phase 
transition, has a transition threshold; the occurrence of Salam phase transition will in turn enlarge 
PVED nonlinearly. Hence, if the temperature is kept in the transition temperature range all along, 
the  control  parameter  PVED  can  exceed  its  critical  value  (threshold)  for  enough  time,  and  it  is 
possible to form a dissipative structure and finally develop into an ordered and homochiral system. 
This scenario is being tested in our laboratory. A related and interesting phenomenon was reported 
by Ellis-Evans et al[24]: a great lake—Lake Vostok lies below a flowing ice sheet, and the melting 

 

10 

point  temperature  is  –3.15  ºC  (270K).  Microbiological  studies  of  the  Vostok  ice  core  have 
revealed  a  great  diversity  of  microbes  including  yeasts  and  actinomycetes  (with  antibiotic 
synthesizing potential) which remain viable in ice for up to 3000 years, and viable mycelial fungi 
up to 38600 years old. 

At  last,  we  emphasize  again  the  significance  of  Salam  phase  transition  in  the  evolution  of 
homochirality:  instead  of  an  ultimate  solution  to  the  problem,  it  actually  plays  as  a  first  step  of 
amplification mechanism. It connects the microcosmic difference (PVED) between biomolecular 
enantiomers  with  nonlinear  process  in  a  macrocosmic  biological  system.  It  also  solves  the 
long-term debating suspicion that PVED is too minor to be enlarged directly by nonlinear process. 
Combining the existence of PVED, Salam phase transition and nonlinear amplification mechanism, 
we may propose a sound way to understand the chemical evolution of homochirality as depicted in 
Fig.8.

Introduction

Representations of the Poincaré group [1] define fundamental equations of physics asso-
ciated with spin 0, 1/2, 1 and 3/2: the Klein-Gordon equation, Dirac's equation, Maxwell's
equations and the Rariter-Schwinger equation. The representations of the Poincaré group
do not, however, give insight into the following key issues:

1. The  Heisenberg  commutation  relations  do  not  appear  in  the  Poincaré  algebra
and so must be added on to the theory. These relations are invariant under the
canonical or transformation theory of Dirac [2] that is the quantum generalization

of the canonical or symplectic transformations of the classical Hamiltonian theory.

2. The Poincaré group does not encompass the

 of the weak interactions. These symmetries
interactions nor the
must also be added on to the theory. This has lead to a plethora of higher dimen-
sional theories that attempt to integrate these symmetries with the underlying po-
sition-time space transformations defined by the Poincaré group. These theories
must explain why the higher dimensions are not directly observable.

3. While the fundamental physical concepts of mass and spin (or helicity) may be
ascribed to the interpretation of the two Casimir invariants of the Poincaré group
in the rest (or zero mass) frame, the theory gives no insight into the discrete spec-
tra of the particle rest mass invariants.

4. Many of the theories based on the Poincaré representations are plagued with in-
finities  that  must  be  removed  through  renormalization  theories.  The  physical
foundation of this renormalization has its roots in an invariant cut-off in the dis-
tance and time dimension [3]. In many cases, an equivalent way of describing this
is to say that the acceleration or rate of change of momentum of the particles is
bounded [4][5][6].

To address the first of these issues the theory must have as invariants both the quantum
canonical commutation relations:

With the definition of the line element in equation (3), the concept of an absolute rate of

relativistic  case.  Rather,  forces  are  only  defined  between  bodies  and  their  associated

The physical constants show the dimensional relationships. The homogeneous
group transforms all degrees of freedom into each other and so the concepts of indepen-

3. As will be shown in Section III , all spectra are discrete.

4. This was Born’s basic premise for the reciprocity principle. From the comments
that a bound in rate of change of momentum is in some sense equivalent to the
cut-off, there is some hope in this direction. Definitive determination requires the
development of a full theory towards which the ideas presented here are a small
step.

From  the  analysis,  it  is  apparent  that  the  Canonical  Relativistic  group  has  many  of  the
mathematical properties required to address the four issues highlighted in the introduction.
SU 3( )
The quantum commutation relations are intrinsically defined in the algebra, both
 appear as subgroups of the Little groups for the generalized time-like
and
and null cases. Absolute forces loose their meaning and are defined only between refer-
ence frames associated with particle states. These forces are bounded by the universal
constant
 that provides the third constant to define the dimensional measures. In the limit
of small rates of change of position and momentum relative to their bounding constants,
the  theory  reduces  to  the  expected  Newtonian  limit.  Furthermore,  the  bound  in  relative
forces is qualitatively equivalent to a distance or time cut-off that results in the promise of
a finite theory. The spectra of the Casimir invariants are discrete.

The most remarkable physical consequence of the Canonical Relativistic group is that po-
sition-time space is no longer invariant or absolute. Rather, the full eight degrees of free-
dom of the quantum phase space with the physical degrees of freedom of time, energy,
momentum and position must be considered. This is a remarkable space in that the de-
grees of freedom cannot all be simultaneously diagonalized, but rather may only be done
so in pairs as illustrated with Figure 1. These effects become particularly important as the
rates  of  change  of  position  and  momentum  (relative  velocity  and  force)  approach  the
bounds  and . Such a condition may be present in the early universe and one can en-
vision a theory where the rotation or condensation of the large energy and momentum de-
grees of freedom into the position and time degrees of freedom as the universe cools and
consequently expands in the position and time directions through this transformation.

While the mathematics is intriguing, the question is how to make a connection with physical
theory. The next step would appear to be to study the reduction of the representations of
the full algebra with respect to the usual Poincaré algebra that is a subalgebra (and in par-
ticular the Casimir invariants) and then to derive field equations that are the Canonical Rel-
ativistic group generalization of the Dirac, Maxwell, Klein-Gordon equations that may be
derived from the Poincaré group. These are non trivial tasks and must be the subject of a
subsequent paper.   It is hoped that the ideas presented here will stimulate research into
this mathematically remarkable class of theories that have the promise to address key out-

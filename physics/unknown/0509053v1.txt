Abstract. Published survival data for V79 cells irradiated by monoenergetic protons,
helium-3, carbon, and oxygen ions and for CHO cells irradiated by carbon ions
have been analyzed using the probabilistic two-stage model of cell
inactivation.
Three diﬀerent classes of DNA damages formed by traversing particles have been
distinguished, namely severe single-track damages which might lead to cell inactivation
directly, less severe damages where cell inactivation is caused by their combinations,
and damages of negligible severity that can be repaired easily. Probabilities of single
ions to form these damages have been assessed in dependence on their linear energy
transfer (LET) values.

Damage induction probabilities increase with atomic number and LET. While
combined damages play crucial role at lower LET values, single-track damages
dominate in high-LET regions. The yields of single-track lethal damages for protons
have been compared with the Monte Carlo estimates of complex DNA lesions,
indicating that lethal events correlate well with complex DNA double-strand breaks.
The decrease in the single-track damage probability for protons of LET above approx.
30 keV/µm, suggested by limited experimental evidence, is discussed, together with
the consequent diﬀerences in the mechanisms of biological eﬀects between protons and
heavier ions. Applications of the results in hadrontherapy treatment planning are
outlined.

Cell inactivation by protons and light ions

1. Introduction

Hadron radiotherapy, based on irradiating tumours by beams of accelerated protons
and other ions, is expected to signiﬁcantly increase the cure rate of cancer in near
future; compare e.g. (Mayer et al 2004, Krengli and Orecchia 2004, Brahme et al 2001,
Debus et al 1998). The well-known rationale for using proton beams in radiotherapy
lies in the characteristic pattern of their energy deposition to matter, the Bragg peak,
leading to the possibility of achieving highly conformal dose distributions (Wilson
1946, Zurlo et al 2000, Cella et al 2001). Beams of light ions possess additional
advantages: They are characterized by higher linear energy transfer (LET) values,
leading to enhanced relative biological eﬀectiveness (RBE) and diminishing oxygen
enhancement ratio (OER), e.g. (Wambersie et al 2004). They are therefore expected
to be especially suitable for curing tumours resistant to conventional radiotherapy;
compare e.g. (Wambersie et al 2004, Schulz-Ertner et al 2002). Another advantage
consists in the possibility of online dose monitoring by positron emission tomography,
PET (Enghardt et al
Furthermore, recent clinical studies indicate that
unconventional fractionation schemes might be used for selected tumours, reducing the
overall treatment time to a few sessions only (Tsujii et al 2004).

2004).

Several dedicated hadrontherapy facilities have been launched recently, compare
(Sisterson 2005). In most of them only proton beams are available; however, in several
centres, existing or being built, protons as well as light ions up to carbon or oxygen may
be used. For the choice of an optimal ion in given clinical situations, analyses of energy
loss, scattering and fragmentation phenomena for diﬀerent ions and comparisons of their
dose distributions are necessary (Brahme et al 2001, Kr¨amer et al 2000, Schall et al
1996). These physical analyses have to be complemented then by biology-oriented
studies, analyzing the mechanisms of biological eﬀects for diﬀerent ions using available
data and adequate models.

However, existing hadrontherapy treatment planning approaches have been based
on detailed description of the physical processes only, and have not addressed the
biological phase of the underlying radiobiological mechanism in detail. E.g. the
treatment planning procedure used at HIMAC (Chiba, Japan) is based on interpolating
the α, β coeﬃcients of the linear-quadratic (LQ) ﬁts to experimental survival data, and
on the similarity in biological eﬀects between carbon and neutron beams of similar LET
values (Kanai et al 1997, 1999); compare also (Kagawa et al 2002). In the approach
used in clinical hadrontherapy applications at GSI (Darmstadt, Germany), the local
eﬀect model (LEM), the eﬀect of ion tracks on a microscopic scale is assumed to be equal
to that of correspondingly high photon doses (compare (Kr¨amer and Scholz 2000));
again, the underlying biological processes of damage induction and repair have not been
taken into account explicitly. On the contrary, the present paper summarizes the results
of a detailed biology-oriented analysis of cell inactivation data for protons, helium-3,
carbon and oxygen ions. Experimental data gathered by several groups (Belli et al
1998, Perris et al 1986, Goodhead et al 1992, Folkard et al 1996, Weyrather et al

Cell inactivation by protons and light ions

1999, Stoll et al 1995) have been analysed with the help of a detailed probabilistic
radiobiological model (Kundr´at et al 2005).

2. Probabilistic two-stage model of radiobiological eﬀects

The processes running in a cell after irradiation (under conditions usual in radiotherapy)
proceed in two distinct, subsequent phases. The ﬁrst stage includes processes running
immediately after the impact of individual ionizing particles, i.e. energy transfer events,
radical formation and diﬀusion, chemical reactions and formation of DNA damages.
The other stage is formed then by the subsequent cellular response which follows as a
reaction to the eﬀect of all ionizing particles having hit a cell nucleus or chromosomal
system at a given dose; this stage includes the processes of damage repair or misrepair
and further biological processes leading to cell survival or inactivation. Distinguishing
these two phases represents the basis of the probabilistic two-stage model of biological
eﬀects of ionizing particles.

In the full scheme of the model, the following characteristics are taken into account:
(i) the stochastic distribution of particle tracks over the irradiated cell population, (ii)
the distribution of transferred energy, (iii) the probability of single traversing particles
to induce DNA damages of diﬀerent severity, (iv) saturation or synergetic combinations
of individual damages, and (v) the eﬀects of cellular repair systems. The model scheme,
presented in (Kundr´at et al
2005), allows to describe diﬀerent classes of survival
curves, including also low-dose hypersensitivity phenomena, on the basis of detailed
characteristics of the mentioned processes, especially the eﬀects of damage induction
and repair processes. However, in the following comparison of the eﬀects of diﬀerent
light ions that are expected to be used in hadrontherapy, a simpliﬁed model scheme will
be used, taking into account only DNA damages that are practically unrepairable.

The cell inactivation probability at applied dose D is given by

Here, the number k (k ≥ 0) of primary particles (particle tracks) traversing individual
cell nuclei is given by Poisson distribution

(i) Severe damage formed by a single track that is capable of causing cell inactivation
even if this is the only damage to the cell (”single-track” or ”single-particle induced”
damage). The probability of inducing such a damage, per track, has been denoted
by a.

(ii) Damages of lower severity, at least two of which must combine to be lethal
(”combined” or ”two-track” damages). The probability of their formation (per
track) has been denoted by b.

(iii) Lesions that do not represent any signiﬁcant challenge to the cell and its repair

systems. Such negligible lesions have not been included in Eq. (3).

The above classiﬁcation of DNA damage is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the damage classiﬁcation according to damage
complexity.

Eq. (3) represents the general formula for cell inactivation after a passage of k
particles. The eﬀects of cell repair systems have been included in repair probabilities rab
ij .
In the present analysis, however, only unrepairable damages have been considered, for
which rab
ij ≡ 0. In other words, the probabilities a and b derived here represent the lowest
estimates of damage induction at corresponding energy transfers (LET values), since
unrepairable damages form, essentially, subsets of all (both repairable and unrepairable)
damages in the above classiﬁcation (Eq. (3), Figure 1).

Considering unrepairable damages only, cell inactivation follows, then, if at least
one single-track or at least two combined-type damages have been formed by the k
particles traversing the nucleus. Indeed, for rab

ij ≡ 0, Eq. (3) may be simpliﬁed to

qk = (1−a)k −(1−a)k

j)bj(1−b)k−j = (1−a)k[(1−b)k +kb(1−b)k−1](4)

(with q0 = 1 and q1 = 1 − a), i.e., the cell survives if no single-track and not more than
a single b-type damage have been formed by the k particles. ‡

‡ The corresponding Eqs. (9-15) in (Kundr´at et al 2005) represented simpliﬁed versions of formulas
derived from Eq. (3), as combined damages b were taken into account in a simpliﬁed manner
only: The synergetic eﬀects were represented by terms (1 − b2)k(k−1)/2 only, yielding e.g. qk =
(1 − a)k(1 − b2)k(k−1)/2 after neglecting the repair probabilities. By comparing this formula with
Eq. (4) it is clear that the role of combined damages was slightly underestimated, especially in the
region of higher particle numbers. I.e. the analyses based on precise formulas derived from Eq. (3)
yield slightly higher combined-damage induction probabilities as compared to the simpliﬁed formulas
used in (Kundr´at et al 2005). This fact, however, does not aﬀect the conclusions drawn in that
paper, especially those concerning the role of single-particle and combined damage induction and repair
processes with respect to the shapes of survival curves.

3. Analysis of experimental data

Survival data for V79 cells irradiated by protons at 0.57 – 7.4 MeV (Belli et al 1998,
Folkard et al 1996, Perris et al 1986, Goodhead et al 1992), helium-3 at 3.4 – 6.9 MeV
(Folkard et al 1996), carbon at 2.4 – 266 MeV/u (Weyrather et al 1999) and oxygen
ions at 1.9 – 396 MeV/u (Stoll et al 1995) have been analysed using the model reviewed
in the preceding section. The list of particle energies, LET values and ranges in water
is given in Table 1.

To facilitate a systematic analysis of the given data sets, the damage induction
probabilities for a given ion have been considered in dependence on LET value λ
instead of deriving their values for individual measured survival curves independently.

Cell inactivation by protons and light ions

These LET dependences have been represented by ﬂexible test functions involving a low
number of auxiliary parameters, a0−2 and b0−2:

a(λ) = a0(1 − exp(−(a1λ)a2)) ,

b(λ) = b0(1 − exp(−(b1λ)b2)) .

(5)

Parameter values have been determined using standard optimization methods; mainly
the SIMPLEX and MIGRAD methods implemented in the MINUIT multivariate
minimization tool (James 1994) have been applied to dedicated computer codes written
in FORTRAN. Weighted least-square method has been used to construct the objective
function, χ2, as described previously (Kundr´at et al 2005).

Model representations of survival curves for V79 cells irradiated by diﬀerent ions
are shown in Figures 2-5. In Figure 6, the probabilities of single-track and combined
damage induction are plotted as functions of LET for diﬀerent ions. Values of auxiliary
model parameters are listed in Table 2.

Values in the range of 50 – 135 µm2, also reported in the literature (compare e.g.
(Scholz and Kraft 1995, Belli et al 1998)), have yielded similar results (ﬁgures not
shown here). For CHO cells, the value of geometrical cross section σ = 108 µm2 was
taken, as reported in the given experiment (Weyrather et al 1999).

Cell inactivation by protons and light ions

4. Discussion

4.1. Single-track damage induced by protons: Possible indications for diﬀerences in
radiobiological mechanisms between protons and ions

Measured data for protons of LET values above approximately 30 keV/µm (Belli et al
1998) suggest that the single-track damage formation probability, a, might decrease in
this region; compare Figure 8 where more detailed ﬁts to the data are shown, based on
the parameterization

a(λ) = a0(1 − exp(−(a1λ)a2)) exp(−(a3λ)a4) ,
b(λ) = b0(1 − exp(−(b1λ)b2)) .

Whereas the value of the goodness-of-ﬁts criterion is χ2 = 350 for the data of Belli et al
(1998) in the joint ﬁts to proton-induced survival shown in Figure 2, the corresponding
value for the detailed ﬁts shown in Figure 8 is χ2
detailed = 55. The goodness-of-ﬁts to
this data set can be, in fact, further improved if, in addition to a decreasing single-
track damage probability, the combined-damages are allowed to dominate in the whole
protons’ LET range and their repair is taken into account, compare (Kundr´at et al
2005).

To verify the hypothesis of decreasing single-track damage probability for protons of
high LET, further experimental studies are necessary, as the existing evidence is limited
to two survival curves measured under a single experimental setup only. Even though
this decrease corresponds to very limited proton ranges in tissues only (approximately 15
µm or smaller) and will probably not manifest in clinical applications, this ﬁnding would
be important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the radiobiological eﬀects:
For heavier ions, no such complex behaviour has been observed in the studied LET
ranges, the damage induction probabilities exhibiting saturation characteristics only
(Figure 6). It means that for heavier ions the RBE eﬀects termed often as ”overkill”
occur as a result of too high energy deposits to individual cells. For protons, on the
other hand, this evidence suggests that they are already the eﬀects of single particles
on the level of DNA damage formation that get saturated and are responsible for the
decrease of biological eﬀectiveness observed experimentally (Belli et al 1998).

4.2. The inﬂuence of repair processes

As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the eﬀects of cellular repair processes might
be important in representing the outcome of proton irradiation. Also the ﬁts to 3He
data in the high-dose region might be improved signiﬁcantly by incorporating the

are very challenging and, consequently, the data in this region have a limited reliability
(Folkard et al 1996); therefore, the authors have interpreted the upward-bending of
survival curves as artiﬁcial eﬀects only. However, the results shown in Figure 9
demonstrate that similar upward bending might follow as a result of repair processes;

have, therefore, been considered in the present work (Section 3). The induction
probabilities for both single-track and combined damages have been estimated on
the basis of survival data only. This slightly limits the reliability of estimating the
roles of combined-track events, b, in the higher-LET regions, whereas the unrepairable
single-track damages, a, have been assessed reliably in the whole studied LET regions.
Somewhat higher values of damage induction probabilities would be obtained if the
inﬂuence of repair processes were included. A corresponding concept, including a wider
class of damages and their repair by the cells, has been used in analyzing radiobiological
data for cell lines of diﬀerent radiosensitivity; the results will be presented and discussed
in detail elsewhere (Hromˇc´ıkov´a et al 2005).

4.3. On the interpretation of the damage classiﬁcation

Clustered DNA lesions of high complexity (locally multiply damaged sites, complex
lesions) are thought to represent signiﬁcant challenges to cellular repair systems, and to
play crucial roles in cell inactivation by ionizing particles (Ward 1985, Goodhead 1994,
Ottolenghi et al 1997). The existing estimates of their yields have been based mostly
on Monte Carlo calculations involving track structure simulations and simpliﬁed models
of DNA and/or chromatin structure. Due to their complexity and computational costs,
these approaches have been performed for photons and low-energy particles only. On the
other hand, the present approach, based on analyzing survival data, enables to derive
the yields of lethal events also for high-Z high-energy ions (Figure 6). By comparing the
present results with the mentioned Monte Carlo calculations, mechanistic interpretation
of the damage classiﬁcation used in the present work might be sought, and the fraction
of lethal events among diﬀerent classes of complex lesions can be estimated.

As the ﬁrst step in this direction, the present results for lethal damage induced
by protons in V79 cells have been compared to estimates of complex lesions
calculated on the basis of a fast Monte Carlo damage simulation model proposed by
Semenenko and Stewart (2004). In Figure 10, the LET-dependent yields of single-track
lethal events, a, are compared to the total number of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and
DSBs composed of at least 4, 6, 8, and 10 elementary lesions (single-strand breaks
(SSBs), base damages or abasic sites). This ﬁgure indicates that the present results
are consistent with the trends predicted by Monte Carlo calculations. In Figure 11, the
ratio between the number of lethal events and DSBs of diﬀerent complexity is shown,
again as a function of LET. Whereas only 0.05 – 0.5% of all DSBs formed (denoted
by DSB total in Figures 10 and 11) are lethal, this portion increases to approximately
3 – 4% for DSBs composed of at least 8 elementary lesions (DSB 8+); this number being
uniform (LET-independent), i.e. being consistent with the hypothesis of a uniform repair
probability for these speciﬁc damages.

These results indicate that the single-track lethal damages, a, might be related to
clustered lesions of very high complexity, and correlate best with DSB 8+, containing
at least 6 elementary DNA lesions in addition to 2 SSBs forming the DSB. Similarly,

the combined damages, b, might correspond to pairwise combinations of DSBs formed
by diﬀerent tracks,
leading to large-scale chromosomal aberrations; compare e.g.
(Sachs and Brenner 1993). Further damage induction and repair studies are, however,
necessary to identify the biophysical nature of lethal events reliably. Furthermore, this
comparison has been performed for protons only, given the limitations of existing Monte
Carlo approaches. Eﬀorts will therefore be made to extend these calculations to heavier
ions and higher energies, using correspondingly simpliﬁed Monte Carlo-based models.

4.4. Applications in hadrontherapy treatment planning

The analyzed proton and helium-3 data (Belli et al
1996,
Perris et al 1986, Goodhead et al 1992) concern irradiation by low-energy particles
only, with ranges in tissue of approx. 10 µm – 0.7 mm for protons and 24 – 74 µm for
3He ions, respectively (Table 1), corresponding to track ends of these particles. On the

other hand, data for carbon (Weyrather et al 1999) and oxygen ions (Stoll et al 1995)
have been gathered over wide energy (and LET) ranges of these particles, corresponding
to penetration depths of approx. 45 µm to 140 mm for carbon ions and 30 µm to 200
mm for oxygen ions, covering the majority of clinically relevant ranges. Figures 4 and 5
illustrate that the simpliﬁed probabilistic model enables to represent cell survival over
such wide ranges in a systematic manner by using a low number of parameters only (the
present analysis involves 6 parameters, a0, a1, a2 and b0, b1, b2, plus the cross section of
cell nuclei, σ). This is a prerequisite if the model is to be used in treatment planning
In the present analysis, cell inactivation eﬀects have been studied for

monoenergetic particles as function of their LET value (corresponding to their energy).
For treatment planning applications, an adequate physical model, describing the spectra
of particle energy and LET values as function of penetration depths and including also
energy-loss straggling, lateral scattering and fragmentation processes, has to be used
together with the model of biological eﬀects presented here. Such a physical model
might be based on detailed Monte Carlo calculations (e.g. (Ziegler 2004)) or semi-
phenomenological parameterization of measured experimental data (Kr¨amer et al 2000,
Chu et al 1993). Calculations of survival as function of penetration depth for several
cell lines, using the radiobiological module presented here and a simpliﬁed description
of physical processes based on SRIM-2003 calculations, have been already performed,
showing good agreement with measured data; the results will be presented separately
(Kundr´at 2005). To enhance the predictive power of the model, relation between the
damage induction probabilities a, b and track structure characteristics of diﬀerent ions
will be sought, with the aim to help in identifying the optimal ion in diﬀerent clinical
situations. Additional systematic experimental data, especially for inactivation induced
by light ions (helium to nitrogen), would be helpful in solving this issue, too.

5. Conclusion

Systematic analysis of published survival data for V79 cells irradiated by light ions has
been performed using a simpliﬁed scheme of the probabilistic two-stage model. The
probabilities of single ions to induce severe damage to DNA have been derived for
diﬀerent ions in dependence on their LET values. In the lower-LET regions, combined
damages dominate, while survival at higher LET values is governed by single-particle
damages (Figure 6). The present results give quantitative estimates of the increase in
damage complexity with increasing atomic number Z and LET value. The analysis of
survival data for CHO-K1 cell line shows then the diﬀerences in DNA damage induction
for diﬀerent cell lines.

The derived probabilities of

inducing single-track lethal damages have been
compared with the Monte Carlo estimates of the yields of complex DNA lesions. Good
agreement between these two methodologically diﬀerent approaches was demonstrated,
indicating the biophysical interpretation of lethal events and the importance of damage
complexity with respect to its biological consequences.

The results of this work will be used in proposing detailed biology-oriented
approaches for hadrontherapy treatment planning. The results may also contribute to
understanding the diﬀerences between the mechanisms of biological eﬀects of diﬀerent
ions.

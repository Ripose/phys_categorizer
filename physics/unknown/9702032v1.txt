Abstract

A complete choice of generators of the center of the enveloping algebras
of real quasi-simple Lie algebras of orthogonal type, for arbitrary dimension,
is obtained in a uniﬁed setting. The results simultaneously include the well
known polynomial invariants of the pseudo-orthogonal algebras so(p, q), as
well as the Casimirs for many non-simple algebras such as the inhomogeneous
iso(p, q), the Newton–Hooke and Galilei type, etc., which are obtained by
contraction(s) starting from the simple algebras so(p, q). The dimension of
the center of the enveloping algebra of a quasi-simple orthogonal algebra turns
out to be the same as for the simple so(p, q) algebras from which they come
by contraction. The structure of the higher order invariants is given in a
convenient “pyramidal” manner, in terms of certain sets of “Pauli–Lubanski”
elements in the enveloping algebras. As an example showing this approach at
work, the scheme is applied to recovering the Casimirs for the (3+1) kinemat-
ical algebras. Some prospects on the relevance of these results for the study
of expansions are also given.

1 Introduction

The role of Casimir (or polynomial) invariants of Lie algebras is rather important
in physics as well as in mathematics. They generate the center of the universal
enveloping algebra U(g) of g. Physically, in any theory with a symmetry algebra,
they appear as related to conserved quantities, as they commute with all genera-
tors. The work of Racah [1] solved the problem of obtaining the Casimir invariants
associated to a simple Lie algebra and, in particular, Gel’fand explicitly found a
particular basis of the center of the enveloping algebra of so(N + 1) [2]; the case for
the pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebras so(p, q) (in fact, for all simple classical algebras)
has been also dealt with in explicit form by Perelomov and Popov [3]. General re-
sults concerning both simple and non-simple Lie algebras have been established; for
instance, a formula giving the number of primitive independent Casimir operators
of any Lie algebra can be found in [4], and a complete description of the theory of
polynomial and/or rational invariants appears in [5]. These results allow to deduce
all invariants related to any particular Lie algebra on a case-by-case basis, but do
not give directly a general perspective of the structure of the invariants associated
to a complete family of “neighbour” algebras, as for instance provided by a given Lie
algebra and (some of) its contractions: the general problem of relating the universal
enveloping algebra of a given Lie algebra and one of its possible contractions is not
yet solved, though complete results are available for special cases (see for instance,
[6] where Casimirs for a large family of contractions of sl(3, IC) are given, or [7] where
the problem of behaviour of bilinear invariants under contraction is studied within
the graded contraction approach). This problem has deﬁnite interest in physics,
where contractions are related to some kind of “approximation” and understand-
ing how invariants behave under contraction and under the “inverse” expansion or
deformation process are illuminating aspects of the theory.

The aim of this paper is to obtain, within a such “simultaneous” approach, all the
Casimir invariants for every Lie algebra in a rather large family, the so-called quasi-
simple or Cayley–Klein (CK) algebras of orthogonal type [8, 9]. This family includes
the real simple pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebras so(p, q) of the Cartan series Bl and
Dl as well as many non-simple Lie algebras which can be obtained by contracting
the former ones. The complete family of quasi-simple orthogonal algebras can be
obtained starting from the compact algebra so(N + 1) in two diﬀerent ways. One
possibility is to use a “formal transformation” which introduces numbers outside
the real ﬁeld (either complex, double or dual (Study) numbers) [10], and another
makes use of the theory of graded contractions [11, 12], without leaving the real
ﬁeld. Adopting this last point of view, it is shown that a particular solution of the
graded contractions of so(N + 1) leads to the CK algebras as an N-parametric
Z⊗
2
family of real Lie algebras denoted soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) [13]. The Lie algebra structure
of the above family together with a listing of its most interesting members are brieﬂy
described in section 2.

N

When all ωa are diﬀerent from zero, soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) is a simple algebra (iso-
2 ] (square brackets

morphic to so(p, q) with p + q = N + 1), whose rank is l = [ N +1

2

denoting here, as usual, the integer part). The dimension of the center of its uni-
versal enveloping algebra equals the rank l of the algebra, and it is generated by a
set of homogeneous polynomials (Casimir operators) of orders 2, 4, . . . , 2[ N
2 ], and an
additional Casimir of order l when N + 1 is even. We present in section 3 the ex-
plicit structure of the Casimir invariants corresponding to any algebra in the family
soω1,...,ωN (N + 1). These invariants are deduced starting from the original approach
of Gel’fand but where the necessary modiﬁcations are introduced in order to get
expressions which cover simultaneously all algebras in the family soω1,...,ωN (N + 1),
whether the constants ωa are diﬀerent from zero or not. This means that the be-
haviour of these Casimirs upon any contraction ωa → 0 is built-in in the formalism,
and they do not require any rescaling which should be made when the contraction
is performed in the In¨on¨u–Wigner sense. Every Casimir we obtain is non-trivial for
any contracted algebra (whether or not the constants ωa are diﬀerent from zero);
furthermore, these constitute a complete set of Casimirs for CK algebras.

The main tool is provided by some elements in the enveloping algebra, labeled
by an even number 2s of indices, Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs, which are homogeneous of order
s in the generators. In the case of the (3+1) Poincar´e algebra, the components of
the Pauli–Lubanski vector (whose square is the fourth-order Casimir) are in fact
W -symbols with four indices. In this way, the Casimir invariants are presented in
a pyramidal intrinsic form since each Wa1a2...asas+1b1b2...bsbs+1 can be written in terms
of W ’s with two less indices Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs, and ultimately, in terms of W -symbols
with two indices, which are simply the generators themselves.

The problem of giving explicit expressions in terms of generators for Casimirs
in CK algebras has been also approached by Gromov [14] by applying the above
mentioned formal transformation to the Casimir invariants of so(N + 1) obtained
by Gel’fand: those expressions should be equivalent to the ones we obtain (as giving
a possibly diﬀerent basis for the center of the enveloping algebra), but the explicit
introduction of the W ’s makes the choice in this paper a lot simpler and easily
tractable. The general expressions for Casimirs written directly in terms of genera-
tors, as in [14], are overall more cumbersome to apply to speciﬁc Lie algebras than
the ones involving W ’s, specially when N increases.

The results are illustrated in section 4 by writing the general expressions of the
invariants associated to soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) for N = 2, 3, 4, 5; in particular, for N = 4
we focus on the (3+1) kinematical algebras [15] thus obtaining a global view of the
limit transitions among their corresponding Casimir operators. The way of getting
the Casimirs in the Minkowski space starting from those in the DeSitter space by
letting the universe “radius” R → ∞ is well known; this familiar example appears
in our scheme as a rather particular case, yet it may facilitate grasping the scope
of the results we obtain, which includes a much larger family of algebras than the
well-known kinematical ones.

We make in the Conclusions some brief comments on the role of these results for

the study of expansions.

2 The family of quasi-simple orthogonal algebras

Consider the real Lie algebra so(N + 1) whose 1
0, 1, . . . , N, a < b) satisfy the following non-vanishing Lie brackets:

2N(N + 1) generators Ωab (a, b =

[Ωab, Ωac] = Ωbc

[Ωab, Ωbc] = −Ωac

[Ωac, Ωbc] = Ωab

a < b < c.

(2.1)

N

Through a Z⊗
graded contraction process a family of contracted real Lie algebras
2
can be deduced from so(N + 1). The general solution has been given in [16]; it
includes from the simple Lie algebras so(p, q) to the abelian algebra of the same
dimension. For reasons which will become clear shortly, we restrict here to a par-
ticular subfamily [13], whose members have been called quasi-simple algebras [8]
because they are very “near” to the simple ones. They depend on N real coeﬃcients
ω1, . . . , ωN and the generic member of this family will be denoted soω1,...,ωN (N + 1).
Their non-zero commutators are given by

[Ωab, Ωac] = ωabΩbc

[Ωab, Ωbc] = −Ωac

[Ωac, Ωbc] = ωbcΩab

a < b < c

(2.2)

without sum over repeated indices. Note that all Lie brackets involving four diﬀerent
indices a, b, c, d as [Ωab, Ωcd] are equal to zero.

The two-index coeﬃcients ωab are written in terms of the N basic ωa by means

ωab = ωa+1ωa+2 · · · ωb

a, b = 0, 1, . . . , N

a < b,

(2.3)

of:

therefore

ωa
1 a = ωa
ωac = ωabωbc

−

a = 1, . . . , N
a < b < c.

(2.4)
(2.5)

Each coeﬃcient ωa can be reduced to +1, −1 or zero by a simple rescaling of the
initial generators; then the family soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) embraces 3N Lie algebras called
CK algebras of orthogonal type or quasi-simple orthogonal algebras. Some of them
can be isomorphic; a useful isomorphism is:

soω1,ω2,...,ωN−1,ωN (N + 1) ≃ soωN ,ωN−1,...,ω2,ω1(N + 1).

(2.6)

The algebra soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) has a (vector) representation by (N + 1) × (N + 1)
real matrices, given by

where eab is the matrix with a single non-zero entry, 1, in the row a and column b.
In this realization, any element X ∈ soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) satisﬁes the equation:

(2.7)

(2.8)

where Iω is the diagonal matrix

Iω = diag (+, ω01, ω02, . . . , ω0N ) = diag (+, ω1, ω1ω2, . . . , ω1 · · · ωN )

(2.9)

Ωab = −ωabeab + eba

X Iω + Iω

tX = 0,

4

and tX means the transpose matrix. We state this property by saying that X is an
Iω-antisymmetric matrix; when all ωa = 1, this reduces to the standard antisymme-
try for the generators of so(N + 1).

The CK algebras soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) are the Lie algebras of the motion groups of

N-dimensional symmetrical homogeneous spaces X0:

X0 ≡ SOω1,...,ωN (N + 1)/SOω2,...,ωN (N),

(2.10)

where the subgroup H0 ≡ SOω2,...,ωN (N) is generated by the Lie subalgebra h0 =
hΩab, a, b = 1, . . . , Ni. Each space X0 has constant curvature equal to ω1 and its
principal metric can be reduced to the form diag (+, ω2, ω2ω3, . . . , ω2 · · · ωN ) at each
point.

In the sequel we identify the most interesting Lie algebras appearing within
soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) according to the cancellation of some ωa [17, 18]. In particular,
the kinematical algebras [15] associated to diﬀerent models of spacetime are CK
algebras. In the list below, when we explicitly say that some coeﬃcient is equal to
zero it will be understood that the remaining ones are not. It is remarkable that
each case ωa = 0 can be regarded as an In¨on¨u–Wigner contraction limit, where some
parameter εa → 0 [13, 19].

(1) ωa 6= 0 ∀a. They are the pseudo-orthogonal algebras so(p, q) with p + q = N + 1
of the Cartan series Bl or Dl. The quadratic form invariant under the fundamental
vector representation is given by the matrix Iω (2.9).

(2) ω1 = 0. They are inhomogeneous pseudo-orthogonal algebras iso(p, q) with
p + q = N which have a semidirect sum structure:

so0,ω2,...,ωN (N + 1) ≡ tN ⊙ soω2,...,ωN (N) ≡ iso(p, q).

The “signature” of the metric invariant under soω2,...,ωN (N) is (+, ω12, ω13, . . . , ω1N ).
The most interesting cases are the Euclidean algebra iso(N) which is recovered
once for (ω1, ω2, . . . , ωN ) = (0, +, . . . , +), and the Poincar´e algebra iso(N − 1, 1)
which appears several times, for instance, for (ω1, ω2, . . . , ωN ) = {(0, −, +, . . . , +),
(0, +, . . . , +, −), (0, +, . . . , +, −, −, +, . . . , +), (0, −, −, +, . . . , +), (0, +, . . . , +, −, −)}.
From the isomorphism (2.6) is clear that the CK algebras with ωN = 0 are also of
this kind and similarly for the next types.

(3) ω1 = ω2 = 0. They are twice inhomogeneous pseudo-orthogonal algebras
iiso(p, q) with p + q = N − 1:

so0,0,ω3,...,ωN (N + 1) ≡ tN ⊙ (tN

1 ⊙ soω3,...,ωN (N − 1)) ≡ iiso(p, q).

The signature of soω3,...,ωN (N − 1) is (+, ω23, ω24, . . . , ω2N ). Hence the Galilean alge-
bra iiso(N − 1) is associated to (0, 0, + . . . , +).

(4) ω1 = ωN = 0. They are ii′so(p, q) algebras with p + q = N − 1:

so0,ω2,...,ωN−1,0(N + 1) ≡ tN ⊙ (t′N

1 ⊙ soω2,...,ωN−1(N − 1)) ≡ ii′so(p, q),

−

−

5

where so(p, q) acts on tN through the vector representation while it acts on t′N
1
−
through the contragredient of the vector representation. Thus, ii′so(N − 1) is the
Carroll algebra with coeﬃcients (0, +, . . . , +, 0) [15].

(5) ωa = 0, a 6= 1, N. They are the tr(so(p, q)⊕so(p′, q′)) algebras [20]. In particular,
for ω2 = 0 we have t2N
2(so(p, q) ⊕ so(p′, q′)) with p + q = N − 1 and p′ + q′ = 2,
which include the expanding and oscillating Newton–Hooke algebras for q = 0 [15].

−

(6) When all coeﬃcients ωa = 0 we ﬁnd the ﬂag space algebra so0,...,0(N + 1) ≡
i . . . iso(1) [8].

3 The Casimir invariants

We ﬁrst recall the necessary deﬁnitions and tools [4, 5]. Then we summarize the
approach and the results of Gel’fand for so(N + 1) [2]. Afterwards we compute the
Casimir invariants for the CK algebras soω1,...,ωN (N + 1); when there is no risk of
confusion we shall denote this Lie algebra simply as g.

3.1 Deﬁnition of polynomial invariants

Let Ug the enveloping algebra of g generated by all polynomials in Ω01, . . . , ΩN
1N
and S the symmetric algebra of g isomorphic to IR[αab; a, b = 0, 1, . . . , N; a < b],
this is, the ring of polynomials in 1
2N(N + 1) commutative variables αab. A generic
polynomial is denoted as p = p(α01, . . . , αN
The adjoint action, ad Ωab : g −→ g

1N ).

−

−

ad Ωab(Ωcd) = [Ωab, Ωcd],

(3.1)

is extended to an “adjoint action” of g on Ug and also to another action on S:

ad Ωab

: u ∈ Ug −→ [Ωab, u] ≡ Ωabu − uΩab ∈ Ug,

(3.2)

ad Ωab

: p = p(α01, . . . , αN

1N ) ∈ S −→ Oab(p) ≡

−

N

C mn

ab,cdαmn

∂p
∂αcd

∈ S,

Xc,d,m,n=0

(3.3)
where C mn
ab,cd are the structure constants of g. We are using the pairs ab as indices for
the basis elements of g, so the conditions a < b, c < d and m < n will be assumed
without saying. The structure constants themselves, read from (2.2), are:

C mn

ab,ac = δmbδncωab, C mn

ab,bc = −δmaδnc, C mn

ac,bc = δmaδnbωbc,

a < b < c.

(3.4)

The invariants in Ug and S under the adjoint action of g are the following subsets:

U Ig ≡ {u ∈ Ug | [Ωab, u] = 0, ∀Ωab ∈ g} ⊂ Ug,
SI ≡ {p ∈ S | Oab(p) = 0, ∀Ωab ∈ g} ⊂ S,

(3.5)
(3.6)

6

and the elements of U Ig are called polynomial or Casimir invariants of g. According
to the general results described in [4, 5] the two main steps to obtain the Casimir
invariants are:
• To compute the subset SI of S.

• To apply to each element of SI the canonical mapping φ : S → Ug deﬁned for any
monomial by symmetrization:

φ(αa1b1 . . . αarbr ) =

Ωπ(a1b1) · · · Ωπ(ar br),

(3.7)

1
r!

Πr
Xπ
∈

where Πr is the group of permutations on r items, and extended to S by linearity.

An upper bound for the number of independent invariants for g is provided by:

Proposition 1 [5]. The maximal number of algebraically independent Casimir invari-
ants τ associated to any algebra g is

τ ≤ dim (g) − r(g),

(3.8)

where dim (g) is the dimension of g, and r(g) is the rank of the antisymmetric matrix
Mg whose elements are

(Mg)ab,cd =

C mn

ab,cdαmn

a < b, c < d, m < n.

(3.9)

N

Xm,n=0

For the simple Lie algebras so(p, q), p + q = N + 1, the number τ is equal to the
rank of the algebra, τ = [ N +1
2 ]. In this case the upper bound saturates the inequality,
and this can be checked by computing the rank r(g) of the matrix (3.9). However,
it is not necessary that g be simple in order to have the equality τ = dim (g) − r(g).
For instance, the Poincar´e algebra iso(3, 1) has two algebraically (quadratic and
fourth-order) independent Casimirs, and in this case the equality also holds; the
same happens for all the inhomogenous pseudo-orthogonal algebras iso(p, q) which
appear in the CK family when ω1 = 0 or ωN = 0 and the remaining ones are diﬀerent
from zero.

We will show that equality holds in (3.8) for all CK algebras, so although the CK
set contains non-simple algebras, all members in each family have the same number
of algebraically independent Casimirs. This is the main reason to restrict in the
paper from the general set of graded contractions of so(N +1) to the subfamily of CK
algebras. The property of having exactly [ N +1
2 ] algebraically independent Casimirs
justiﬁes the quasi-simple name allocated to them. This property is no longer true
for other contractions of so(N + 1) beyond the CK family, as the extreme case of the
abelian algebra, which has as many primitive Casimirs as generators, clearly shows.

3.2 The Gel’fand method

Instead of solving the set of diﬀerential equations (3.6) in order to get the elements of
SI, Gel’fand considered the following antisymmetric matrix associated to so(N + 1):

(3.10)

where αab = −αba. He obtained the Casimir invariants of so(N + 1) from the
coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial of the matrix T :

det (T − λ I) = 0,

(3.11)

where I is the (N + 1) × (N + 1) identity matrix. Due to the structure of the matrix
T , these coeﬃcients are sums of all minors of the same order associated to the main
diagonal of T ; the last coeﬃcient is of course the determinant of T [2].
It turns
out that this determinant is equal to zero when N is even N = 2l , and it is a
perfect square of an homogeneous expression of order l in the variables αab when N
is odd N = 2l − 1. The Casimir themselves are obtained through the replacement
αab → Ωab and further symmetrization on the variables αab in these coeﬃcients.

When N = 2l is even, Gel’fand obtained l such invariants, C1, . . . , Cs, . . . , Cl for

so(N + 1) which are homogeneous polynomials of order 2s in the generators:

Cs =

Ωi1i2Ωi2i3 . . . Ωi2s−1i2sΩi2si1

s = 1, 2, . . . , l.

(3.12)

N

Xi1,i2,...,i2s−1,i2s=0

When N is odd, N = 2l − 1, besides (3.12) there is another invariant coming from
the determinant of T , which is a perfect square of an homogeneous expression in the
generators of order l denoted simply as C:

C =

εi0i1...iN Ωi0i1Ωi2i3 . . . ΩiN−1iN ,

(3.13)

N

Xi0,i1,...,iN =0

where εi0i1...iN is the completely antisymmetric unit tensor. In both expressions the
relation Ωab = −Ωba is understood.

3.3 The case of CK algebras

We now proceed to implement this scheme for the CK algebras. As a ﬁrst step we
write the analogous of T (3.10) only for the pseudo-orthogonal so(p, q) algebras with
all ωa 6= 0 (but without reducing them to ±1), and compute the minors separately.

8

Afterwards, we arrange the details, by introducing some factors depending on the
coeﬃcients ωa in such way that all contractions ωa → 0 are always well deﬁned and
do not originate a trivial result for any of the Casimirs found.

Consider ﬁrst the CK algebras with all ωa 6= 0. Recall that the generators of
soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) have been taken as Ωab only for a < b. If all ωa 6= 0 we can extend
this set and introduce the (linearly dependent) new generators by deﬁning Ωba with
a < b, and their corresponding αba as follows:

if a < b

Ωba := −

αba := −

so that the commutation relations (2.2) can be written in the standard form

[Ωab, Ωlm] = δamΩlb − δblΩam + δbmωlmΩal + δalωabΩbm.

(3.15)

which is the familiar form of the commutation relations for an so(p, q) algebra, with
the non-degenerate metric tensor (2.9). In this special case ωa 6= 0 we associate to
soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) the matrix (3.10) denoted Tω1,...,ωN which now reads

This matrix satisﬁes the property

Tω1,...,ωN Iω + Iω

tTω1,...,ωN = 0,

(3.17)

where Iω is the diagonal matrix (2.9). Recalling (2.8), we say Tω1,...,ωN is an Iω-
antisymmetric matrix.

When all the constants ωa are diﬀerent from zero, it is clear that the Casimir
invariants for soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) are the coeﬃcients of the characteristic polynomial
coming from equation (3.11) where T is replaced by Tω1,...,ωN . In order to get them
we have to calculate the determinant of a generic diagonal submatrix, which will
have the same structure as (3.16) but with a non-consecutive subset of indices, say
Tωi1i2 ,...,ωiK−1iK
. Due to property (3.17) it is easy to show that for an odd K the
determinant is always zero. Therefore, only determinants for even K = 2s might be
diﬀerent from zero. For future convenience, we will denote any arrangement of 2s
indices taken from 012 . . . N in increasing order as a1 < a2 < . . . < as < b1 < b2 < . . .< bs.

We now deﬁne some symbols of 2s indices Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs, for s = 1, 2, . . . , l as:

.

(3.18)

This deﬁnition is justiﬁed since the r.h.s. of (3.18) is a perfect square. The set of
coeﬃcients ωab multiplying the determinant assures that the ﬁnal expressions we

9

are going to obtain are non-trivial even after the limits ωa → 0. Inserting these ω
factors turns out to be equivalent to the usual rescaling made in the contraction of
Casimir invariants by means of an In¨on¨u–Wigner contraction.

The W-symbols give rise to the elements of SI (3.6) and the canonical mapping
φ (3.7) transforms them into invariants of the enveloping CK algebra (3.5). The
symmetrization implied by action of φ on W reduces to a simple substitution αab →
Ωab since all generators appearing in the products of the W-symbols commute. Once
the substitution of the variables αab by the generators Ωab has been performed, we
will denote W := φ(W). Now Wab, Wa1a2b1b2,
. . . , are elements in the universal
enveloping algebra of the CK Lie algebra. Their structure can be most clearly
presented in a recursive way. For a < b, let:

Wab := Ωab,

(3.20)

then W -symbols with four indices a1 < a2 < b1 < b2 are given in terms of those
with two by:

Wa1a2b1b2 = Ωa1b2Wa2b1 − Ωa2b2Wa1b1 + ωa2b1Ωb1b2Wa1a2

(3.21)

and further W -symbols with six, eight, . . . , 2s indices, Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs (with a1 <
a2 < . . . < as < b1 < b2 < . . . < bs), are given in terms of those with two less indices

Through the use of these W ’s we can produce expressions for the Casimir invari-
ants of the CK algebras soω1,...,ωN (N + 1). The key to this adaptation is to proﬁt
from the presence of the constants ωa. When contraction is dealt with through an
In¨on¨u–Wigner type contraction, a suitable rescaling of the non-contracted Casimir
by some power of the contraction parameter is required to give a non-trivial well
deﬁned Casimir for the contracted algebra after the contraction limit. This is made
unnecessary in our approach, which has this rescaling automatically built-in.

We now give the expressions, in terms of these W ’s, for the [ N +1

2 ] Casimir oper-

ators in the general CK Lie algebra soω1,...,ωN (N + 1):
Theorem 2. The l = [ N +1

C = W012...N .

(3.26)

In these expressions any ωaa should be understood as ωaa := 1. It is easy to see
that even in the most contracted CK algebra, the ﬂag space algebra, so0,...,0(N + 1),
these Casimirs are not trivial. In fact, the term in (3.25) with the W -symbol whose
ﬁrst group of s indices are consecutive and start from 0, and whose last group of s
indices are also consecutive and end with N, W 2
1)N , is the
only term whose ω factor is equal to 1, and therefore the only one which survives in
the Casimir Cs for the so0,...,0(N + 1) algebra.

Therefore, theorem 2 provides a set of [ N +1

2 ] non-trivial independent Casimirs
for any Lie algebra in the CK family. The question now is whether there exists any
other Casimir which cannot be obtained by this contraction process. To answer this
we should analyze the upper bound τ (3.8).

Proposition 3. The rank of the matrix deﬁned by (3.9) for soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) is
N 2/2 for even N and (N 2 − 1)/2 for odd N, no matter of the speciﬁc values of the
coeﬃcients ωa.
Proof. The above result is a consequence of the existence of the structure constants
C mn
ab,bc = −δmaδnc (3.4) which are ω-independent, and are non-zero for all algebras
in the CK family. Let us start with the case of an even N = 2l and the 1
2N(N +
1) × 1
2N(N + 1) matrix Mg (3.9). We consider the minor obtained by eliminating
the rows and columns associated to the following l = N/2 variables αab:

α0N α1 N

1 α2 N

−

2

−

. . . αl

2 l+2 αl

1 l+1,

−

−

(3.27)

this is, for α0N we discard the row and column with elements (Mg)0N,kl and (Mg)kl,0N
(∀ kl), and so on. The dimension of this submatrix is N 2/2. It can be checked that

11

in each row and in each column there is always a single α of the sequence (3.27)
without any factor ω. Then by permuting rows and columns we can arrange the
minor in order to get all those α’s in the main diagonal, so its determinant is (up to
a sign), a monomial:

−

1)

3)

α2(N

2 · · · α2

Since this term is ω-independent, this minor is non-zero for any CK algebra. A
similar procedure is applied for an odd N = 2l − 1. Now we take out the rows and
columns linked to the l = (N + 1)/2 variables:

(3.29)

obtaining in this way a minor of dimension (N 2 − 1)/2. By ordering rows and

diagonal; the determinant is (again up to a sign) the monomial:

(3.30)

and the result follows.

Hence, as dim (g) = 1

2 N(N + 1), the upper bound for the number of algebraically
independent Casimirs in any CK algebra turns out to be [ N +1
2 ] which coincides
with the upper bound for the simple algebras where all ωa 6= 0. Since we have
just obtained that number of Casimirs, we conclude that equality in the formula
(3.8) holds for all CK algebras and theorem 2 gives all the Casimirs for the CK
family. We remark that the ﬂag algebra so0,...,0(N + 1) is on the borderline for this
behaviour: if contractions are carried out beyond this algebra, the rank of the matrix
in proposition 3 might not be given by the same values. This can be easily seen: for
the abelian algebra in 1
2 (N + 1)N dimensions, which can of course be reached by
contracting so(N + 1), all generators are central elements.

If we deﬁne now the rank of a Lie algebra in the CK family as the number of
algebraically independent Casimir invariants associated to it, then theorem 2 shows
that all the CK algebras SOω1,...,ωN (N + 1) have the same rank: N/2 if N is even
and (N + 1)/2 if N is odd.

We recall that the ﬁrst Casimir (3.23) for s = 1 is the quadratic invariant related
to the Killing–Cartan form in the case of a simple algebra. If a “Killing–Cartan”
form is deﬁned for all CK algebras as usual:

βab,cd ≡ β(Ωab, Ωcd) = Trace (ad Ωab · ad Ωcd) =

C pq

ab,mnC mn
cd,pq

(3.31)

N

Xm,n,p,q=0

we ﬁnd, by using the structure constants (3.4), that in the basis Ωab this “Killing-
Cartan” form of the CK algebra soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) is diagonal, and its non-zero
components are

βab,ab = −2(N − 1) ωab

a, b = 0, . . . , N

a < b.

(3.32)

12

When all the ωa 6= 0 the Killing–Cartan form is regular (the algebra is simple or
semisimple in the exceptional case D2), so we can write:

C1 =

ω0aωbN Ω2

ab =

βab,cdΩabΩcd.

(3.33)

This is the known relation giving the quadratic Casimir as the dual of the Killing–
Cartan form, which holds for the case of non-zero ωa; otherwise the Killing–Cartan
form is degenerate, and the last term in (3.33) is indeterminate. However, the
structure of this equation shows that in the limit of some ωa → 0, while the Killing–
Cartan form (3.32) degenerates, the Casimir C1 remains well deﬁned, because the
impossibility of inverting the matrix βab,cd conspires with the factor ω0N to produce
a well deﬁned limit for C1. Similarly, higher order Casimir invariants are dual to the
polarized form of a symmetric multilinear form.

The algebraic structure behind the W ’s which allows simple expressions for the
higher order Casimirs should be worth studying. For instance, let us consider the
commutation relations among a generator Ωab and a symbol Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs. There
are two possibilities:

(1) If both indices a and b, or none, appear in the sequence {a1a2 . . . asb1b2 . . . bs},
then the Lie bracket [Ωab, Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs] is zero.
(2) If only one index a or b belongs to {a1a2 . . . asb1b2 . . . bs}, then we have:

[Ωab, Wa1a2...asb1b2...bs] = (−1)p+1

(3.34)

where the new set of indices {a′1a′2 . . . a′sb′1b′2 . . . b′s} is obtained by ﬁrst writing the
sequence {a, b; a1a2 . . . asb1b2 . . . bs} in increasing order, and then dropping the com-
mon index. In the factor (−1)p+1, p means the minimum number of traspositions
needed to bring the sequence {ab; a1a2 . . . asb1b2 . . . bs} into increasing order; for in-
stance, in the sequence {13; 0234} ≡ {0124} p = 3, while in {15; 1234} ≡ {2345}
p = 4. Notice that all ωa′b′ in the denominator cancel, and leave under the square
root a perfect square product of ω’s.

Repeated use of this procedure would give the commutation relations between
two W -symbols. We do not write here the general expressions, but some examples
are given in the next section.

4.1 Results for N=2,3,4,5

In the sequel we elaborate upon the results of the above section by writing explicitly
the Casimir invariants of soω1,...,ωN (N + 1) up to N = 5. These expressions should be
compared with the ones obtained in any approach giving the invariants directly in

13

terms of the generators Ωab, without using the W -symbols, which are cumbersome
as soon as N grows.

N = 2. There is only one invariant:

C1 = ω2Ω2

01 + Ω2

02 + ω1Ω2

12.

N = 3. There are two invariants and the ﬁrst relevant W -symbol (3.21) appears:

C1 = ω2ω3Ω2

01 +ω3Ω2
+Ω2

03
12 +ω1Ω2

C ≡ W0123 = ω12Ω23W01 − Ω13W02 + Ω03W12

= ω2Ω23Ω01 − Ω13Ω02 + Ω03Ω12.

(4.3)

N = 4. From a physical point of view this is a rather interesting case since the
CK family soω1,...,ω4(5) contains the (3+1) kinematical algebras. There are two
invariants:

where from (3.21) we have

(4.6)

W0123 = ω12Ω23Ω01 − Ω13Ω02 + Ω03Ω12
W0124 = ω12Ω24Ω01 − Ω14Ω02 + Ω04Ω12
W0134 = ω13Ω34Ω01 − Ω14Ω03 + Ω04Ω13
W0234 = ω23Ω34Ω02 − Ω24Ω03 + Ω04Ω23
W1234 = ω23Ω34Ω12 − Ω24Ω13 + Ω14Ω23.

As an application of (3.34) we write the non-zero commutation relations among

the ten generators of soω1,ω2,ω3,ω4(5) and the ﬁve W -symbols (4.6):

[Ω04, W0123] = −ω02W1234
[Ω14, W0123] = ω12W0234
[Ω24, W0123] = −W0134
[Ω34, W0123] = W0124

[Ω03, W0124] = ω02W1234
[Ω13, W0124] = −ω12W0234
[Ω23, W0124] = W0134
[Ω34, W0124] = −ω34W0123

[Ω02, W0134] = −ω02W1234
[Ω12, W0134] = ω12W0234
[Ω23, W0134] = −ω23W0124
[Ω24, W0134] = ω24W0123

[Ω01, W0234] = ω01W1234
[Ω12, W0234] = −W0134
[Ω13, W0234] = ω23W0124
[Ω14, W0234] = −ω24W0123

[Ω01, W1234] = −W0234
[Ω02, W1234] = W0134
[Ω03, W1234] = −ω23W0124
[Ω04, W1234] = ω24W0123

(4.7)

As these expressions show, the W -symbols can be thought of as a kind of
“Pauli–Lubanski” components for Lie algebras in the CK family. To see this, no-
tice that when the constants (ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4) ≡ (0, −1, +1, +1), the CK Lie algebra
so0,
In this case there
are ﬁve W -symbols; due to the vanishing of the constant ω1, W1234 is missing in
the expression of the fourth-order Casimir (4.5), and the remaining four are the
components of the standard Pauli–Lubanski operator (see (4.18) below).

1,+1,+1(5) is isomorphic to the Poincar´e algebra iso(3, 1).

From (4.7) is straightforward to ﬁnd the Lie brackets of the W -symbols among

themselves:

[W0123, W0124] = ω12Ω01W0134 + ω12Ω02W0234 + ω02Ω12W1234
[W0123, W0134] = −ω13Ω01W0124 + ω12Ω03W0234 + ω02Ω13W1234
[W0123, W0234] = −ω23Ω02W0124 − Ω03W0134 + ω02Ω23W1234
[W0123, W1234] = −ω23Ω12W0124 − Ω13W0134 − ω12Ω23W0234
[W0124, W0134] = ω14Ω01W0123 + ω02Ω14W1234 + ω12Ω04W0234
[W0124, W0234] = ω24Ω02W0123 − Ω04W0134 + ω02Ω24W1234
[W0124, W1234] = ω24Ω12W0123 − Ω14W0134 − ω12Ω24W0234
[W0134, W0234] = ω24Ω03W0123 + ω23Ω04W0124 + ω03Ω34W1234
[W0134, W1234] = ω24Ω13W0123 + ω23Ω14W0124 − ω13Ω34W0234
[W0234, W1234] = ω24Ω23W0123 + ω23Ω24W0124 + ω23Ω34W0134

In the above expressions it can be noticed how all the contractions ωa → 0 are
always well deﬁned and lead to non-trivial results. For the most contracted algebra
so0,0,0,0,0(6), for instance, we get:

C1 = Ω2

05,

C2 = W 2

0145,

C = W012345.

(4.12)

And for N arbitrary, the Casimirs for this most contracted CK algebra are:

(4.10)

ab] = [ωab], [W 2

scratch, without reference to the general expressions (3.25). If here [X] denotes the
dimension of X, dimensional homogeneity of commutation relations requires that
[Ωab] = [ωab]1/2, so [W 2
a1a2b1b2] = [ωa1b2][ωa2b1], etc. By simply recalling
the W term (4.13) entering into any Casimir without any ωab factor, then the coef-
ﬁcient of any other W 2 is unambiguously derived by simply requiring dimensional
homogeneity for all W 2 terms in the Casimirs and recalling that all terms enter
with the same global sign there. Signs coming from signatures which appear in the
standard known cases (in the Minkowski square of the Pauli-Lubanski vector, for
instance), are hidden inside the ωab themselves.

4.2 Casimirs for 3+1 kinematical algebras

After this algebraic description of the structure of the invariants of the CK algebras
we focus on the most important kinematical algebras included in the soω1,ω2,ω3,ω4(5)
family. Let H, Pi, Ki and Ji (i = 1, 2, 3) the usual generators of time translation,
space translations, boosts and spatial rotations, respectively. Under the following
identiﬁcation with the “abstract” generators Ωab:

H = Ω01
J1 = Ω34

Pi = Ω0 i+1
J2 = −Ω24

Ki = Ω1 i+1
J3 = Ω23

i = 1, 2, 3

(4.14)

we can interpretate the six CK algebras soω1,ω2,+,+(5) with ω2 ≤ 0 as the Lie alge-
bras of the groups of motions of diﬀerent (3+1) spacetime models [15]. Note that
we have ﬁxed the two coeﬃcients ω3 and ω4 to +1 (this is a consequence of the
space isotropy). The two remaining ones have a deﬁnite physical interpretation: ω1
is the constant curvature of the spacetime which appears here as the homogeneous
space given in (2.10), which is the quotient X0 = SOω1,ω2,+,+(5)/SOω2,+,+(4), where
SOω2,+,+(4) is the subgroup generated by the subalgebra h0 = hKi, Jii: this is the
subalgebra of isotopy of a point in spacetime. Similarly, ω2 is the curvature of the
space of time-like lines in spacetime, X01 = SOω1,ω2,+,+(5)/(SOω1(2) ⊗ SO+,+(3)),
where now SOω1(2) ⊗ SO+,+(3) is the isotopy subgroup of a time-like line, generated
by h01 = hH, Jii. This curvature is linked to the fundamental constant c of rela-
1
tivistic theories as ω2 = −
c2 . To make the comparison easier for these cases, we shall
write the two constants involved in the “kinematical” subfamily of CK algebras as:
κ ≡ ω1, −

1
c2 ≡ ω2.

In this notation the commutation rules (2.2) of soκ,

1/c2,+,+(5) read now:

The limit κ → 0 (space-time contraction) gives rise to the ﬂat universes (Min-
kowski and Galilei) coming from the curved ones (DeSitter and Newton-Hooke);
in terms of the “universe radius” R := 1
κ , this is usually made as

√κ or R := 1

R → ∞. The limit c → ∞ (speed-space contraction) leads to “absolute-time”
spacetimes (Newton-Hooke and Galilei) coming from “relative-time” ones (DeSitter
and Minkowski).

5 Concluding remarks

The Casimir invariants play a prominent role in any problem where a Lie algebra and
its enveloping algebra appear. One example of current active interest is the theory
of quantum groups; explicit deformations of the W -symbols can be found in the

17

deformed commutation relations of the quantum CK algebras Uzso0,ω2,...,ωN (N + 1)
with ω1 = 0, and indeed the study of Casimirs in the classical undeformed algebras
we have presented here underlies the expressions for the deformed Casimirs in [21].

A more classical application concerns the expansions processes which can be seen
as the opposite situation of a contraction limit [22]. While the contractions makes to
vanish some structure constants of a Lie algebra which therefore gets more abelian,
the expansions start from a Lie algebra, with some Lie brackets typically equal to
zero, and ends up with another less abelian algebra, which is usually realized as a
Lie subalgebra of the universal enveloping algebra of the initial Lie algebra. The
more known transitions of this kind are the rank-one expansions which allows to
obtain the simple so(p, q) algebras starting from inhomogeneous iso(p, q); the name
rank-one refers to the rank of the homogeneous spaces behind these expansions
(the constant curvature ﬂat and curved space with a metric of signature (p, q))
[22, 23]. In our framework this fact is equivalent to “create” a non-zero coeﬃcient
ω1 out of the case ω1 = 0. Technically, these expansions only involve the quadratic
Casimir C1 to get the correct Lie subalgebra in the enveloping algebra to be expanded
(within an irreducible representation). Extension of these results for high-order
expansions would be of great interest. The rank-two expansions would go from
tr(so(p, q) ⊕ so(p′, q′)) (Newton–Hooke algebras) to so(p, q) algebras, this is, they
would introduce curvature into the space of lines, just in the same way as the rank-
one expansions go from ﬂat to curved spaces of points. Here the two ﬁrst Casimir
invariants C1 and C2 should participate, and it is reasonable to guess that the explicit
introduction of the constants ωa may help in the choice of the correct expansion
procedure which, as far as we know, is yet unknown for higher rank spaces.

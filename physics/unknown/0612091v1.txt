Abstract. It is an approach to introduce the Fokker – Planck equation as an interesting 
natural ingredient in studying the evolution of the market stock prices. 
 
Introduction.  
 
From physical point of view, in many cases, we are interested to study the behavior of 
a  certain  system  –  S.  That  system  may  be  coupled  to  another  system,  let  it  be  a 
reservoir – R, or may be not. If we have to do with coupling, then our system “feels” 
the influence of the reservoir so, we have to consider the behavior of the entire system 
S+R.  Finally,  being  interested  in  properties  of  the  system  S  only,  it  is  necessary  to 
find  a  way  to  eliminate  the  variables  of  R.  A  thorough  analysis  has  been  done  by 
Haken [1] showing that an equation of motion of the system S coupled linearly to the 
reservoir R is of the Langevin type: 
 
                                          
 
where  x  is a variable (or a set of ) of our system S, D some  time – dependent “force” 
and    f(t)  a  fluctuating  “force”  coming  from  reservoir  R.  One  can  show  [1]  that  a 
random “force” f(t) can be taken as:

The stocks market and the Fokker – Planck equation

stock  being  
, to ask what it will be at the subsequent time  t, and the answer to this 
question to be done by the a probability density function satisfying a Fokker – Planck 
equation. 
If we look at Google’s stock prices [2], the stock price, x(t), can be considered as a 
continuous    variable,  and  as  a  random  one,  also.  Nevertheless,  the  “reservoir”  may 
have  an  influence  upon  prices:  a  favorable  (or  not)  article  in  a  very    known 
newspaper,  an  appreciation  of  a  consulting  company,  a  political  interest  at  a  certain 
moment  of  time,  etc.  So,  the  fluctuating  “force”  done  by  (2)  can  have 
,  or  

n j =
, and as a consequence, the correlation function is of the form done by (3). 

n j =
 
First version, linear dependence 
 
 Following  Haken  [1],  we  are  in  a  thermodynamics  approach  of  a  Brownian  motion 
= C. Let 
where the “coherent force” 
us  take  C  =  1  as  a  hypothesis.  The  time  evolution  of  Google’s  stocks  price  has  a, 
rather,  complicated  dependence  on  time,  and  it  is  not  specific  for  Google,  it’s 
generally valid. In the limits of experimental data, as physicists say, we can simplify 
that dependence assuming a linear one. The stock price, x(t), can be taken as: 
 
                                                      
 
Allowing    x(t)  being  of  the  form    (7),   
Fokker – Planck equation takes the form: 
     

                                                          (7)

Using data [2] regarding close and high stock’s prices, an average between them,  x(t) 
can be taken as: 
 
                                           
 
Fig. 1 shows such a dependence and the confidence interval, as well. t  is the day’s 
number, namely 1 for the first day (Aug.19, 2004), 2  for the second working day and 
so  on.  The  data  cover  the  interval between    t  =  1  (Aug.19,  2004),  t  =  573  (Nov.24. 
2006) .

Second version, quadratic dependence 
 
What will happen if the stock’s price will reach a maximum value and then starts to 
decrease?  Obviously,  the  time  evolution  shall  not  have  the  form  done  by  (7). 
Processing  the  data  concerning  the    Google’s  prices  at  close  session,  we  can  get  an 
expression like this one: 
                                                
                                            
 
    Such a form will change the drift coefficient D1 ,and  D2 as well

Conclusions 
 
To  apply  the  Fokker  –  Planck  equation  in  order  to  study  the  market  price  evolution 
seems to be an appropriate one. As one can see from what was mentioned above, we 
cannot predict the jumps in prices, but who can? What can do such an approach is to 
give a reasonable idea of what probable will happen, and it for not a very long period. 
Data accumulation will improve the estimation.

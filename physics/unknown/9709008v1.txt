Abstract

A new method to construct Hamiltonian functions in involution is presented. We show
that on left-symmetric algebras a Nijenhuis-tensor is given in a natural manner by the
usual right-multiplication. Furthermore we prove that symplectic Lie-algebras carry
the structure of a Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold.

Introduction

A Poisson-Nijenhuis structure on a manifold (see [1], [2]) provides a technique to
construct a family of Hamiltonian functions in involution. We ﬁrst recall Poisson-
Nijenhuis manifolds in general and then consider linear Poisson-Nijenhuis structures
on a vector space.
It will be shown that linear Nijenhuis tensors on a vector space are
in one-to-one correspondence with the structure of a so-called left-symmetric algebra.
Such a structure naturally exists on symplectic Lie algebras, i.e. Lie-algebras with
a non-degenerate 2-cocycle. Since on semi-simple Lie algebras a 2-cocycle is always
degenerate, we have to consider non semi-simple Lie algebras, which is in contrast to
usual constructions using semi-simple Lie algebras. Normally integrable systems are
described by the solutions of the modiﬁed Yang-Baxter equation. These are classiﬁed
on semi-simple Lie algebras [3]. Left-symmetric algebras were ﬁrst studied in [4] and
[5]. It will be further seen that so-called symplectic Lie-algebras (see refs. [6], [7], [8])
admit an interpretation as Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold in a natural manner. By taking
the trace polynomials of the linear Nijenhuis tensor, polynomial functions in involution
can be constructed on these symplectic Lie algebras. The technique presented here
is completely diﬀerent from that of Mishchenko and Fomenko (see ref.
[9]). The
Hamiltonian functions in involution on a symplectic Lie-algebra can be pulled back in
an appropriate way to its connected Lie-group to produce there Hamiltonian functions
in involution.

2 Bihamiltonian Systems

To motivate the notion of Poisson-Nijenhuis-manifolds we ﬁrst introduce so-called bi-
hamiltonian systems. These are dynamical sytems whose evolution in time is governed
by two Hamiltonian functions. To do this we need the notion of Poisson-bivectors.

1

Deﬁnition 2.1 Given a manifold M, dimM = m, then the tensor Λ ∈ Γ(Λ2T M )
is called Poisson-bivector, iﬀ its Schouten-bracket vanishes, i.e.

[Λ, Λ](α, β, γ) def= (LΛ♯(α)Λ)(β, γ) + dα(Λ♯(β), Λ♯(γ)) = 0

1
2

where α, β, γ ∈ Γ(T ∗M ) and Λ♯ : T ∗M −→ T M is determined by:

α(Λ♯(β)) = Λ(α, β).

L denotes the usual Lie-derivative.

Remark 2.1 A Poisson-bracket on M is deﬁned by: {F, G} def= Λ(dF, dG). Further-
def= Λ♯df .
more the Hamiltonian vector ﬁeld of a function f : M −→ IR is given by: Xf
The vanishing of the Schouten-bracket is equivalent to the Jacobi-identity of {, }.

A bihamiltonian system is by deﬁnition given by two Hamiltonian functions H1, H2 :
M −→ IR and two Poisson-bivectors Λ1, Λ2 such that:

Λ♯

2dH2

def= XH2 = XH1

def= Λ♯

1dH1

This can be read as the ﬁrst part of the recursion relation:

2dHn+1 = Λ♯
Λ♯

1dHn, n ∈ IN

(1)

A simple consideration shows that if the {Hn}n ∈ IN exist, they are in involution with
respect to each of the Poisson-brackets formed by Λ1 and Λ2:

{Hn, Hm}1 = {Hn, Hm}2 = 0, n, m ∈ IN

If we assume Λ♯
2 to be invertible, a necessary condition for the existence of the se-
quence {Hn}n≥3 is dα = 0 with α def= N ∗dH1 and N ∗ def= (Λ♯
1. Hereby
the mapping N ∗ is the transpose of a mapping N : T M −→ T M : (N ∗α)(X) def=
α(N X), α ∈ Γ(T ∗M ), X ∈ Γ(T M ). The identity

2)−1Λ♯

dα(X, Y ) = −

dH1([N , N ](X, Y )), X, Y ∈ Γ(T M ),

with the Nijenhuis torsion [N , N ] deﬁned by:

[N , N ](X, Y ) def= [N X, N Y ] − N ([N X, Y ] + [X, N Y ]) + N 2[X, Y ],

1
2

(see e.g. [1]) implies dα = 0 for [N , N ] = 0. If N : T M −→ T M fulﬁlls the condition
[N , N ] = 0, it is called Nijenhuis tensor. Starting with a Nijenhuis tensor N the
vanishing of its Nijenhuis torsion implies the recursion relation:

N ∗dHn = dHn+1,

(2)

with the Hamiltonian functions Hn
Nijenhuis-tensor (see e.g. [10]).
We are now looking for a Poisson-bivector Λ such that the tensor ΛN , deﬁned by:

n T rN n, n ≥ 1, the trace polynomials of the

def= 1

ΛN (α, β) def= Λ(α, N ∗β) = α(Λ♯N ∗β), α, β ∈ Γ(T ∗M ),

2

is again a Poisson-bivector, i.e. Λ1 = ΛN , Λ2 = Λ.
In this case we obtain the recursion relation:

Λ♯

N dHn = Λ♯dHn+1.

(3)

This means, that the Hamiltonian functions {Hn}n ∈ IN are in involution with respect
to the Poisson-bracket formed with Λ and ΛN . (See also [5]). The conditions to be
fulﬁlled by N and Λ such that ΛN is a Poisson-bivector shall be examined in the
following section.

2.1 Poisson-Nijenhuis-Structures on Symplectic Manifolds

In what follows we will restrict ourselves to the case where the Poisson-bivector Λ
is invertible. Then a symplectic form ω is deﬁned on M by setting: ω(X, Y ) def=
Λ(Λ♭X, Λ♭Y ), X, Y ∈ Γ(T M ), Λ♭ = (Λ♯)−1 and (M, ω) is a symplectic manifold.
We formulate the compatibility conditions for ΛN being a Poisson-bivector in the
following theorem:

Theorem 2.1 Consider a symplectic manifold (M, ω) endowed with a mapping N :
T M −→ T M . Then the following holds:

i) The antisymmetry of the tensor ΛN is equivalent to the symmetry of N
with respect to ω: ω(N X, Y ) = ω(X, N Y ).

ii)Under the assumption that N is symmetric with respect to ω, a 2-form
def
F is deﬁned by setting F (X, Y )
= ω(N X, Y ). Then the Schouten-bracket
[ΛN , ΛN ] of ΛN fulﬁlls the identity:

[ΛN , ΛN ](α, β, γ) = dF (Λ♯(α), Λ♯(β), Λ♯(γ))

−ω([N , N ](Λ♯(α), Λ♯(β), Λ♯(γ))

The proof is straightforward and can be found in [2].

Remark 2.2 Therefore, if N is symmetric with respect to ω and in addition [N , N ] =
0 and dF = 0, then ΛN is a Poisson-bivector and we have the recursion relation (3).
The trace polynomials are therefore in involution with respect to each Poisson-bracket
deﬁned by Λ and ΛN . If the compatibility conditions are fulﬁlled the triple (M, ω, N )
is called Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold.
In [5] the compatibility conditions for ω and N such that (M, ω, N ) is a Poisson-
Nijenhuis-manifold are formulated in a diﬀerent but nevertheless equivalent manner.

3 Linear Nijenhuis-Tensors on Vector Spaces and
Symplectic Lie-Algebras

Up to now, only few Poisson-Nijenhuis structures are explicitely known (see e.g. [10]).
To ﬁnd new Poisson-Nijenhuis structures we now consider such structures on a vector-
space V. The simplest non-trivial choice is obviously a Nijenhuis-tensor depending
linearly on the co-ordinates. We therefore make the ansatz:

N (p)ei = Rk

ij xj(p) ek,

(4)

where {xi}i=1,...,n, n = dimV are global coordinates on V with respect to a ba-
sis {ei}i=1,...,n and {Rk
ij}i,j,k=1,...,n are constant coeﬃcients. For N deﬁned above

3

to be a Nijenhuis-tensor its Nijenhuis-torsion has to vanish. Thus the coeﬃcients
{Rk
ij}i,j,k=1,...,n have to fulﬁll certain algebraic conditions as the following lemma
shows:

Lemma 3.1 The Nijenhuis-torsion of the tensor deﬁned in (4) has the coordinate
expression:

1
2

[N , N ]k

ij (p) = (−Rk

ml(Rm

ij − Rm

ji ) − (Rm

il Rk

jm − Rm

jl Rk

im))xl(p)

(5)

This equation admits a surprising interpretation. To this purpose we interprete the
coeﬃcients {Rk
ij}i,j,k=1,...,n as structure constants of a multiplication on V making it
to an algebra by setting:

ei · ej = Rk

ij ek.

If we furthermore deﬁne the associator of this algebra as follows:

[x, y, z] def= (x · y) · z − x · (y · z)

(6)

(7)

then the Nijenhuis-torsion has an elegant expression as the subsequent theorem shows:

Theorem 3.1 Given the tensor deﬁned in formula (4), then its Nijenhuis-torsion
[N , N ] fulﬁlls the relation:

[N , N ](p)(x, y) = [x, y, p] − [y, x, p], p, x, y ∈ V

(8)

Remark 3.1 Because of formula (8) linear Nijenhuis-tensors on a vector space are in
one-to-one correspondence with left-symmetric multiplication structures on this vector
space. Furthermore each linear Nijenhuis-tensor is given by the right-multiplication:
Np(x) = x · p = Rp(x).

Thus the identity:

[x, y, z] = [y, x, z]

(9)

has to be fulﬁlled for all x, y, z ∈ V in order the Nijenhuis-torsion of N to vanish. Since
the associator measures the lack of associativity of an algebra the algebra structure
above is in general non-associative. Algebras whose associator fulﬁlls (9) are called
left-symmetric algebras. They will be introduced in the following section.

3.1 Left-Symmetric Algebras

Left-symmetric algebras appeared ﬁrst in [4] and [5] and are also called Koszul-Vinberg
algebras. Their algebraic structure is studied in [11] and [12].
Consider an algebra A and deﬁne an associator on A as above.

Deﬁnition 3.1 A is called left-symmetric iﬀ for all x, y, z ∈ A the identity:

[x, y, z] = [y, x, z],

i.e.

holds.

(x · y) · z − x · (y · z) = (y · x) · z − y · (x · z)

4

Thus, as mentioned above, left-symmetric algebras are in general non-associative,
whereas associative algebras are trivial examples for left-symmetric algebras.
Nevertheless, by setting [x, y] def= x·y−y·x a Lie-bracket is deﬁned. The Jacobi-identity
follows because of the left-symmetry property of the associator:

[x, [y, z]] + [y, [z, x]] + [z, [x, y]] = [y, x, z] − [x, y, z]
+ [z, y, x] − [y, z, x]
+ [x, z, y] − [z, x, y]
= 0

Therefore every left-symmetric algebra gives rise to a Lie-algebra.

Remark 3.2 The geometric interpretation of a left-symmetric multiplication is given
by a left-invariant ﬂat torsion-free connection on the connected Lie-group GA of A
(see e.g. [11]).

3.2 Symplectic Lie-Algebras

Symplectic Lie-algebras are studied in [6], [7] and [8].
A Lie-algebra G endowed with a non-degenerate 2-cocycle ω : G × G −→ IR, i.e. which
fulﬁlls the cocycle identity:

ω([x, y], z) + ω([y, z], x) + ω([z, x], y) = 0

is called a symplectic Lie-algebra.
By

ω(x · y, z) def= −ω(y, [x, z])

(10)

a left-symmetric multiplication is deﬁned on G.

Proof: The left-symmetry property [x, y, z] = [y, x, z] is equivalent to the fact that

the left-multiplication Lx(y) = x · y fulﬁlls the representation property

L[x,y] = LxLy − LyLx.

With (10) one has: Lx(y) = ω♯(ad(x).ω♭(y)), where ω♭ : G −→ G∗ is deﬁned by:
(ω♭(x))(y) def= ω(x, y), with x, y ∈ G, ω♯ = (ω♭)−1 and ad denotes the ad-
joint representation of G on itself. With these considerations the representation
property of the left-multiplication is a direct consequence of the representation
Q.E.D.
property of the adjoint representation.

We now consider ω as constant symplectic form on G. As it will be shown, the
Nijenhuis-tensor N(p) = Rp is symmetric with respect to ω. Further the exterior
diﬀerential of the 2-form F formed with N(p) = Rp and ω vanishes:

Theorem 3.2 Consider a symplectic Lie-algebra (G, ω). Then the triple (G, ω, Rp) is
a Poisson-Nijenhuis manifold.

Proof: First we observe that the Nijenhuis-tensor is symmetric with respect to ω:

ω(Rp(y), z) = ω(y, Rp(z)).

5

Further one has:

dF(p)(x, y, z) = ω(y · x, z) − ω(x · y, z) + ω(x · z, y)

= −ω(x, [y, z]) − ω(y, [z, x]) − ω(z, [x, y])
= 0,

since ω fulﬁlls the cocycle-identity (10).

Q.E.D.

Remark 3.3 A simple argumentation shows that semi-simple Lie-algebras never ad-
mit a non-degenerate 2-cocycle.

3.2.1 Explicit Expressions

To give an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian functions Hn, it is necessary to
make some considerations before. Given an arbitrary left-symmetric algebra A. If the
left- respectively the right-multiplication is deﬁned by setting Lxy def= x · y respectively
Rxy def= y · x, x, y ∈ A, then the left-symmetry property can be rewritten as follows:

RxRy − Ry·x = RxLy − LyRx, x, y ∈ A

(11)

Deﬁning the linear functional τ : A −→ IR by τ (x) def= T rRx we obtain:

Hn(x) =

T r(Rx)n

=

τ ((Rx)nx),

n

n

b(x, y) def= T r RxRy = T r Ry·x

H2(x) =

b(x, x), x ∈ A

2

dHn(x)(h) = τ ((Rx)n−1h),

(see also [12]). Further a symmetric bilinear form is deﬁned by:

Thus for example the Hamiltonian function H2 can be expressed as follows:

With identity (2) a formula for the diﬀerential dHn is obtained:

Remark 3.4 In the case of a symplectic Lie-algebra (G, ω) the identity: τ (x) =
−2 T r ad(x) holds. Therefore, if G is unimodular, the trace polynomials {Hn}n ∈ IN
all vanish (see e.g. [6]).

where x, h ∈ A.

3.3 Example

As an example we consider the semidirect product GL(n, IR) × IRn, where GL(n, IR)
denotes the Lie-algebra of real n × n-matrices.
To obtain a symplectic form we deﬁne ω(x, y) def= ν([x, y]), where ν : GL(n, IR) ×
IRn −→ IR is chosen such that ω is invertible (see [8] for further details).
On GL(n, IR) × IRn a Lie-bracket is deﬁned as follows:

[(A, x), (B, y)] = (AB − BA, Ay − Bx),

6

where A, B ∈ GL(n, IR) and x, y ∈ IRn. Deﬁning the 1-form ν by:

ν(A, x) def= T r(M A) + g(x), g ∈ IRn∗, M ∈ GL(n, IR)

we have further:

ω((A, x), (B, y)) = g(Ay) − g(Bx) + T r([M, A], B).

In general the explicit expressions in co-ordinates of the Hamiltonian functions Hn
are rather complicated. Thus we restrict ourselves to the case n = 2:
To obtain a basis for GL(2, IR)×IR2 we make the decomposition GL(2, IR) = SL(2, IR)⊕
{1I}, where SL(2, IR) is the Lie-algebra of traceless real 2 × 2-matrices and 1I is the
unit-matrix of GL(2, IR). With the basis

H =

1
0
0 −1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

X+ =

0 1
0 0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

X− =

0 0
1 0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

of SL(2, IR) and the basis

e1 =

1
0 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

e2 =

0
1 (cid:19)

(cid:18)

of IR2, a basis for GL(2, IR) × IR2 is obtained:

v1 = (0, e1), v2 = (0, e2), v3 = (1I, 0),
v4 = (H, 0), v5 = (X+, 0), v6 = (X−, 0).

We choose

M =

l
0

(cid:18)

1
l (cid:19)

and g(x) = a < e1, x >, where x ∈ IRn, a, l ∈ IR and < , > is the usual scalar
product in IRn. If {¯xi}i=1,...6 denote the co-ordinates with respect to the basis above,
we make the change of co-ordinates:

¯x1 = x1 − x5 +

2
a
¯x4 = x4 ¯x5 = x1 + x5, ¯x6 = x6,

x6, ¯x2 = x2, ¯x3 = x3 − x4,

such that in these co-ordinates H2(x) = 1
form, i.e. the bilinear form b is diagonalized. Then we obtain ﬁnally:

2 b(x, x), x ∈ GL(2, IR) has got its standard

H1(x) = −4x3 + 4x4
2H2(x) = −4ax1
3H3(x) = −4x3

2 + 4x3
3 + 16x4
−6ax2(x1 + x5)2

2 + 4ax5

2 + 8x4
3 + 6a(x1 − x5)(x1 + x5)(x3 − 2x4)

2

It can easily be seen that dH1 ∧ dH2 ∧ dH3 6= 0 almost everywhere. Therefore the
functions H1, H2, H3 form a complete set of Hamiltonian functions in involution on
GL(2, IR) × IR2.

Remark 3.5 The family of functions in involution {Hn}n ∈ IN on the Lie-algebra G
may be appropriately pulled back to the connected Lie-group G of G. On G a symplectic
form is deﬁned by pulling back the symplectic form ω on G. The familiy of functions
on G obtained above are then again in involution with respect to the Poisson-bracket
which is given by this symplectic form on G.

7

4 Conclusion

The functional independence of the the trace polynomials can be proven up to now
only analytically and for the simplest cases. It is still to be examined, whether the
functional independence can be proved also algebraically, i.e. by using the algebraic
structure of left-symmetric algebras (see [12]). This would be in analogy to the proof
of the functional independence of the Mishchenko-Fomenko polynomials (see [9]).
On the connected Lie-group G of a symplectic Lie-algebra, a canonical momentum
mapping J : G −→ G∗ exists. The Hamiltonian functions in involution on G described
above may be pulled back appropriately on G∗ and from there as already mentioned
with J to the Lie-group G producing Hamiltonian functions in involution.
In [8] the semidirect product GL(n, IR) × IRn is considered as symplectic Lie-algebra.
Furthermore a Poisson-morphism between the connected Lie-group GL(n, IR) × IRn
belonging to GL(n, IR)×IRn and and the cotangent bundle of the conﬁguration space of
the translating top, T ∗(SO(n) × IRn) is constructed. By pulling back the Hamiltonian
functions in involution on GL(n, IR)×IRn via this Poisson-morphism there is a possible
physical interpretation for the so-obtained Hamiltonian functions in involution.

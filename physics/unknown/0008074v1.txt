Abstract

For 

to 

power 

the  baseline  APT  (Accelerator  Production  of
Tritium)  linac  design,  power  couplers  are  required  to
transmit  210-kW  of  CW  RF 
the
superconducting cavities.  These APT couplers operate at
700  MHz,  have  a  coaxial  design  and  an  adjustable
coupling  to  the  superconducting  cavities.    Since  May
1999, we have been testing couplers of this design on a
room-temperature  test  stand.    We  completed  tests  at
transmitted-power  and  reflected-power  conditions  up  to
1 MW.  We also tested the couplers with a portion of the
outer conductor cooled by  liquid  nitrogen.    Under  this
latter condition, we studied the effects of condensed gases
on  coupler  performance.    The  results  of  these  tests
indicate that the APT couplers are capable of delivering
more than 500 kW to the cavities.  We are in the process
of increasing the baseline coupler design requirement to
420 kW of transmitted power to take advantage of this
successful development.  In this paper, we describe the
results of our high-power coupler tests.

1  INTRODUCTION

The APT power coupler is one of the challenges for the
APT (Accelerator Production of Tritium) linac, which has
a  high-energy  superconducting  (SC)  section  spanning
210–1030 MeV [1].  Due to a high current of 100 mA, a
large  amount  of  CW  RF  power  must  be  transmitted
through these  couplers  to  the  SC  cavities.    In  1997,
180 kW was the highest CW power transmitted through
couplers  to  a  particle  beam,  which  was  limited  by
multipacting and cooling to remove RF losses.  At that
time, a coupler requirement of 210 kW (at 700 MHz) was
chosen for the APT couplers as a reasonable extrapolation
of the technology, and two couplers would be needed to
feed  each  cavity  operating  at  a  modest  gradient  of
5 MV/m.

Figure 1 shows the APT coupler design.  Five design
features  were  particularly  employed  to  enhance 
its
capability to robustly transmit high CW RF power:  (1)
A coaxial-type RF window with two ceramic disks was
chosen to minimize window failures and their impacts; (2)
Warm windows were chosen and located away from line of
sight  of  the  beam  to  minimize  multipacting;  (3)  A
coaxial line with a large diameter was chosen to increase
the power thresholds of the multipacting band; (4) A large
vacuum port at the coupler was included to insure good

vacuum at the coupler and window; and (5) Extensive RF
and thermal simulations were performed to reduce RF loss
and to optimize cooling.

Details of the coupler design and results of low-power
tests can be found in Ref. [2] and [3] respectively, and
will not be repeated here.  In this paper, we describe the
high-power tests that  we  performed  in  the  last  twelve
months.

2  HIGH-POWER TESTS

The high-power tests  were  performed  on  a  specially
designed test stand (Figure 2) [5].  The test  stand  was
supplied with up to 1 MW of 700-MHz RF power from a
klystron.  RF power was transmitted from one coupler,
through a copper cavity, to a second coupler, and then to a
water-cooled RF load.  The couplers and the copper cavity
were well matched to provide 100% transmission.  This
arrangement  allowed 
two  couplers
simultaneously.    Since  the  test  stand  was  at  room
temperature,  the  test  conditions  were  slightly  different
from those conditions that would be if the couplers were
in a cryomodule.  Also, the inner conductors were cooled
by air on the test stand instead of gaseous helium as is
planned for the APT plant operation.

The test stand was equipped to perform three types of
tests:  (1)  Transmitted-Power  Capability;  (2)  Totally-
Reflected Power; and (3) Condensed-Gas Effect.  Details
and results of these tests are described in Sections 2.1 to
2.3.

We tested couplers with fixed and adjustable couplings.
The adjustability of a coupler is provided by tip bellows
made of BeCu.  Couplers with fixed coupling, which do

not have the tip bellows, are expected to offer more robust
operation,  but  less  flexibility  during  the  APT 
linac
operation  where  a  range  of  beam  currents  will  be
accelerated.

sliding-short positions, we reach a power level of 550 kW
CW and a power level of 850 kW at a duty cycle of 50%.

2.3   Condensed Gas Test

Before testing, the components of  the  couplers  were
cleaned in a Class-1000 clean area.  The outer conductors
were rinsed with deionized-water (DI) and allowed to dry in
the cleanroom.  Using Gauge-32 copper wool, the inner
conductors were scrubbed with DI  water  and  methanol.
Following scrubbing, they were rinsed with DI water and
air-dried.  The parts were assembled in the cleanroom and

components were inserted into the copper cavity and the

2.1   Transmitted-Power Capability Test

In the first test, RF power was transmitted through the
couplers  into  the  RF  load.    During  conditioning,  the
power level was raised in steps to reach the highest power
level possible.  The  size  of  the  steps  was  defined  by
increases in vacuum level caused by increased heating and
outgassing of the couplers.  With a baseline vacuum of 8
x 10-9 Torr, the increase in vacuum was kept to below 1 x
10-6. 
  During  these  tests,  both  fixed  and  adjustable
couplers reached 1 MW of CW power.

2.2  Totally-Reflected Power Test

In the reflected-power test, the RF load was  replaced
with a  “sliding  short,”  which  reflected  all  the  forward
power and set up a standing-wave pattern in the couplers.
The total reflection of power was to simulate a situation
during APT plant operation where  the  beam  might  be
lost, reflecting nearly all the RF power.  This test was
conducted with the fixed couplers only.  During testing,
the maxima and minima of the standing wave were moved
to  five  locations  over  a  quarter  wavelength  along  the
system by adjusting the sliding-short  position.    For  a
sliding-short  position  corresponding 
full  current
operation,  the  tests  reached  950  kW  CW.    For  other

Experiences of other laboratories have shown that gas
condensation on power couplers enhances multipacting by
changing the secondary emission coefficients of coupler
surfaces and introducing vacuum bursts released  by  RF
heating.    To  investigate  the  condensed-gas  effects,  we
cooled  the  outer  conductor  by  passing  liquid  nitrogen
through  the  passages  of  the  coupler  heat  exchanger
originally designed for liquid helium.  Figure 3 shows the
measured temperature profiles at different power levels and
the  calculated  temperature  profile  at  210  kW  for  the
cryomodule and on test bed.  Water vapor and CO2 were
condensed during  these  tests.    Test  results  showed  no
enhancement of multipacting.

3  OBSERVATIONS DURING TESTS
In this section, we summarize our observations during
the tests.  These observations were interesting to high-
power coupler operations.  Their resolution will lead to
future tests and design improvements.

3.1  Bellows Failures and Thermal Analysis

While testing power couplers with adjustable coupling,
the  BeCu  tip  bellows  failed  on  two  occasions  after
reaching a transmitted power level of 750 kW.  Inspection
of the failed tip bellows indicated that over-heating caused
the failures.  The proposed explanation of overheating was
supported  by  thermal  calculations.    The  calculations
showed that because of the stagnation of cooling air in the
convolutions  and  the  lower  thermal  and  RF  electrical
conductivities  of  BeCu 
two
respectively compared to pure copper), the temperature of
the tip bellows could be 800˚C higher than the rest of the
inner conductor.  This is much higher than  the  design
temperature and would lead to failure of BeCu material.
Thermal simulations further showed that the temperature
of the bellows could be effectively reduced by 400˚C if we

(factors  of 

four  and 

copper-plated the BeCu bellows and used helium gas as
coolant (instead of air) during the test as is specified in the
plant design.  

3.2  Electron Etching

All power couplers tested exhibited evidence of electron
activity on the surface of the inner conductors.  Figure 4
shows a pattern of markings indicative of such activity.
The patterns varied in concentration and position with test
as well as with power level.  At low power levels (£ 500
kW), there were only shallow dendrical patterns.  Above
500 kW, the patterns were deeper and more concentrated.
Although  the  electron  activity  did  not  affect  coupler
operation,  we  are  concerned  with  degradation  of  the
components with time and deposition of copper from the
inner conductor surface onto RF windows  and  cavities.
We are planning additional tests to find the threshold of
this “electron etching” and its dependence on other factors.

3.3  Outgassing During Power Conditioning

During conditioning, partial pressures of residual gases
were measured.    Figure  5  shows  these  pressures  as  a
function of conditioning time along  with  power  levels
during the  testing  of  an  adjustable  coupler.    Initially,
these pressures increased with power level.  At 500 kW,
the  pressures  of  CO2  and  water  decreased  while  the
pressure of hydrogen kept increasing.

The residual-gas pressures during cold tests are shown
in  Figure  6.    As  can  be  seen,  the  partial  pressures
increased starting from time 10:00 when  RF  power  of
500 kW was applied.   The  partial  pressures  decreased
starting at time  11:30  when  the  RF  power  level  was
reduced to 350 kW,  and  condensed  residual  gases  were
released starting at time 13:40 when liquid nitrogen ran
out and the outer conductor warmed up.

4  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
We  successfully  tested  the  performance  of  the  APT
power couplers at high-power with respect to transmitted
power capability, totally reflected power, and condensed-
gas effects on multipacting.  Data indicates that the APT
power-coupler design is capable of handling power much
higher than the APT requirement of 210 kW.  We are in

the  process  of  changing 
the  APT  power-coupler
requirement to 420 kW to reduce the number of couplers
by a factor of two, which will lead to a reduction in the
cost of the linac by $60M.  We are presently conducting a
second set of tests to insure that we can run the couplers
robustly at a power level of 420 kW.

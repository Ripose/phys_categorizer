Abstract 

 

Short-term  physico-chemical  reactions  at  the  interface  between  bioactive  glass 

particles and biological fluids are studied and we focus our attention on the measurements of 

O/Si  atomic  ratio.  The  studied  bioactive  glass  is  in  the  SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5-K2O-Al2O3-

MgO  system.  The  elemental  analysis  is  performed  at  the  submicrometer  scale  by  STEM 

associated with EDXS and EELS. We previously developed an EDXS quantification method 

based on the ratio method and taking into account local absorption corrections. In this way, 

we use EELS data to determine, by an iterative process, the local mass thickness which is an 

essential  parameter  to  correct  absorption  in  EDXS  spectra.  After  different  delays  of 

immersion  of  bioactive  glass  particles  in  a  simulated  biological  solution,  results  show  the 

formation  of  different  surface  layers  at  the  bioactive  glass  periphery.  Before  one  day  of 

immersion, we observe the presence of an already shown (Si,O,Al) rich layer at the periphery. 

In this paper, we demonstrate that a thin “electron dense” (Si,O) layer is formed on top of the 

(Si,O,Al)  layer.  In  this  (Si,O)  layer,  depleted  in  aluminium,  we  point  out  an  increase  of 

oxygen weight concentration which can be interpreted by the presence of Si(OH)4 groups, that 

permit the formation of a (Ca,P) layer. Aluminium plays a role in the glass solubility and may 

inhibit  apatite  nucleation.  After  the  beginning  of  the  (Ca,P)  layer  formation,  the  size  of  the 

“electron dense” (Si,O) layer decreases and tends to disappear. After two days of immersion, 

the (Ca,P) layer grows in thickness and leads to apatite precipitation.

Introduction 

 

Bioactive glasses, glass ceramics and calcium phosphate ceramics have received much 

attention  for  hard  tissue  replacement  applications  because  they can form a direct bond with 

bone.1 This property is known as bioactivity. A bioactive fixation is defined as « an interfacial 

bonding of an implant to tissue by means of formation of a biologically active hydroxyapatite 

layer on the implant surface ».2 Hench established the relationship between glass composition 

and  bioactive  properties.3  These  bioactive  materials  can  be  used  as  coating  on  metallic 

prosthesis  or  as  bone  fillers,4  but  the  composition  has  to  be  optimized  to  give  a  suitable 

compromise between bioactivity and solubility.5 When exposed to biological fluids, bioactive 

glasses  undergo  a  serie  of  physico-chemical  reactions  at  the  periphery,  resulting  in  the 

formation of a silica gel and a calcium phosphate layer on their surfaces.6, 7, 8 

However,  the  formation  of  these  layers  is  not  explained  in  detail  because  of  the 

complexity  of  short-term  events  that  happen  at  the  interface.  Knowledge  of  the  elemental 

distribution at the bioactive glass periphery is important to understand the physico-chemical 

mechanisms  involved  in  forming  the  Si  gel  and  the  (Ca,P)  layer.  This  knowledge  requires 

analysis  at  the  submicrometer  scale.  This  study  was  performed  by  scanning  transmission 

electron microscopy (STEM) associated with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) 

and  with  electron  energy  loss  spectroscopy  (EELS)  thanks  to  a  dedicated  light  elements 

quantification process.9 

This  study  concerns  a  bioactive  glass  in  the  SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5-K2O-Al2O3-MgO 

system.  The  silicon  oxidation  degree  can  play  an  important  role  in  the  regulation  and  the 

formation of physico-chemical processes, notably at the interface between a Si rich layer and 

the  (Ca,P)  layer.  In  this  paper,  we  paid  attention  on  this  interface  by  measuring  locally  the 

O/Si  atomic  ratio,  by  means  of  X-rays  microanalysis  at  the  periphery  of  bioactive  glass 

3 

samples immersed for different delays (0, 12, 24 and 96 h) in a simulated biological fluid. The 

results  will  permit  the  evaluation  of  the  silicon  oxidation  in  the  Si  rich  layer.  On  the  other 

hand, aluminium may inhibit apatite precipitation or reduces glass matrix dissolution. In this 

paper, we also take into account the role of Al during short-term physico-chemical reactions.

Materials and Methods 

Composition of the bioactive glass  

The composition of the bioactive glass (referenced as A9) is : 50% SiO2, 20% Na2O, 

16% CaO, 6% P2O5, 5% K2O, 2% Al2O3 and 1% MgO (% weight). Addition of Al2O3 may be 

used to control the solubility of the glass, but this addition may inhibit the bone bonding.5, 10 

Greenspan D.C.11 showed that 3% Al2O3 added to a bioactive glass inhibits bone bonding. In 

our case 2% of Al2O3 was added and the bioactive glass is in the SiO2-Na2O-CaO-P2O5-K2O-

Al2O3-MgO system.  

Samples preparation  

The  bioactive  glass  was  obtained  by  melting  the  components  at  1350  °C.  Then,  the 

glass was cast, crushed, and transformed into powder of grain size under 40 µm in diameter. 

The glass powder (2 mg) was immersed at 37 °C for different delays (0, 12, 24 and 96 h) in 1 

mL  of  a  standard  Dulbecco’s  Modified  Eagle  Medium  (DMEM).12  DMEM  is  a  simulated 

body fluid and contains the following ingredients (mg/L) : 6400 NaCl, 400 KCl, 200 CaCl2, 

200  MgSO4  7  H2O,  124  NaH2PO4,  and  3700  NaHCO3.  Then  the  bioactive  glass  powder  is 

embedded  in  resin  (AGAR,  Essex,  England).  Thin  sections  of  90  nanometers  nominal 

thickness are prepared by means of a FC 4E Reichert Young ultramicrotome. The sections are 

placed on a copper grid (200 Mesh). Sections were coated with a conductive layer of carbon 

in a sputter coater to avoid charging effects.  

Analysis materials 

Our  experiences  are  carried  out  using  a  scanning  transmission  electron  microscope 

(STEM)  (Philips  CM30).  The  microscope  is  fitted  with  an  energy  dispersive  X-ray 

5 

spectrometer  (EDAX  30  mm²  Si(Li)  R-SUTW  detector)  and  with  a  parallel  electron  energy 

loss spectrometer (GATAN model 666) placed under the STEM column. Analyses are carried 

out using a beryllium specimen holder with 30°-tilt. The electron probe diameter is around 13 

nanometers. EDXS spectra are acquired at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV, with an energy 

resolution of 10 eV per channel and an electron dose of approximately 3 x 106 e-/nm². EELS 

experiments are performed at an accelerating voltage of 250 kV with an energy dispersion of 

0.1 eV per channel.  

 

Methods 

Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry, EDXS, is a common way to perform elemental 

analysis in a transmission electron microscope.13,  14 Recent developments of thin-window or 

windowless  detectors  allow  the  low  Z  elements  (like  boron,  carbon,  nitrogen,  oxygen, 

fluorine,…)  detection.15 Nevertheless, quantitative analysis of these elements is problematic 

due to the absorption of the low energy X-rays in the sample itself.16 Using the quantification 

classical  ratio  method  (also  known  as  Cliff  and  Lorimer  method)17  and  without  taking  into 

account of absorption phenomena leads to underestimate the concentrations of light elements. 

Moreover the concentrations are related to each others. In this way, absorption of low energy 

X-ray influences not only the concentrations of light elements but also the concentrations of 

all  other  elements.  Mostly  absorption  correction  requires  the  knowledge  of  the  local  mass 

thickness.14,  18  In  the  case  of  complex  samples,  heterogeneous  in  composition,  density  and 

thickness,  like  bioactive  glasses  at  different  steps  of  dissolution  in  contact  with  biological 

fluids,  it  is  not  possible  to  use  the  nominal  value  of  section  thickness  or  a  global  value  of 

sample  density  to  correct  absorption.  It  is  then  necessary  to  determine  experimentally  the 

local  mass  thickness.  We  use  EELS  data  to  obtain  experimentally  the  local  mass  thickness. 

More  precisely,  by  combining  EELS  measured  relative  specimen  thickness,  and  X-rays 

6 

characteristic  peaks  intensities,  we  determine  with  an  iterative  process  the  local  mass 

thickness.  More  details  are  given  in  a  previous  publication  dedicated  to  low  Z  elemental 

quantification  in  STEM.9  Thus,  we  can  obtain  weight  concentrations  of  all  elements  of  the 

bioactive glass, including oxygen. In order to evaluate the O/Si and Ca/P atomic ratios across 

the different layers, we performed line spectra acquisition profiles.

Results 

 

As a first check, we ensure that no irradiation damage occurs on the specimens during 

EDXS  acquisition  in  our  experimental  conditions  (electron  dose  of  3  x  106  e-/nm²).  In  this 

way, we measured X-rays characteristic peak intensities for different electron doses up to 107 

e-/nm².  We  do  not  detect  any  significant  elemental  concentration  variations  in  these  typical 

analysis conditions.  

Weight  concentrations  variations  in  O,  Si,  Al,  Ca  and  P  at  the  bioactive  glass  / 

biological  fluids  interface  were  studied  by  EDXS  at  each  time  of  exposure  to  DMEM.  For 

each analysed area, we acquired an EELS spectrum in the low-loss region to obtain the local 

relative  specimen  thickness  in  order  to  perform  quantitative  analysis  as  explained  in  the 

previous section. 

For  each  delay  of  immersion,  differents  weight  concentrations  profiles  have  been 

acquired (7 profiles by sample and 3 samples were used). Results are characterised by a great 

reproducibility with a standard deviation lower than 5 %. Thus, we present only one typical 

profile  for  each  delay  in  the  following  sections.  These  profiles  represent  the  average 

behaviour of all glass particles. 

 

Bioactive glass periphery in the original state 

Figure  1  presents  an  inverted  darkfield  STEM  image  of  the  bioactive  glass.  We  can 

observe  in  the  area  of  the  bioactive  glass  that  the  mass  thickness  is  rather  inhomogeneous. 

Figure  2  shows  the  distribution  of  O,  Si,  Al,  Mg,  Na,  K,  Ca  and  P  weight  concentrations 

across the periphery of bioactive glass particles. We can conclude that the distribution of the 

absorption  corrected  weight  concentrations  is  homogeneous  in  the  bioactive  glass  particles. 

8 

These experimental weight concentrations obtained are close to the theoretical values. Finally, 

we do not observe any formation of specific layers at the periphery. 

Bioactive glass periphery after 12 h of immersion in DMEM 

The inverted darkfield STEM image shows a part of the bioactive glass after 12 h of 

immersion in DMEM (figure 3). Elemental weight concentration profiles of Si, O, Al, Ca and 

P reveal different zones from the center to the periphery of the bioactive glass (figure 4). We 

observe  the  formation  of  a  (Si,O,Al)  layer  at  the  bioactive  glass/biological  fluids  interface. 

We  also  observe  an  additionnal  (Si,O)  thin  layer  (a  few  hundred  of  nanometers)  formed  on 

top  of  the  (Si,O,Al)  layer.  This  (Si,O)  layer  appears  as  an  “electron  dense”  layer  in  the 

inverted  darkfield  STEM  image  (figure  3).  Moreover,  in  this  layer,  oxygen  weight 

concentration  is  higher  than  in  the  (Si,O,Al)  layer.  These  two  characteristics  lead  us  to 

distinguish  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  from  the  (Si,O,Al)  layer.  We  also  see  that,  in  the 

“electron dense” (Si,O) layer, aluminium weight concentration is very low. The O/Si atomic 

ratio  in  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer  is  around  3  so  that  this  ratio  is  around  2  in  the 

(Si,O,Al) layer. In these two layers, concentrations of Ca, P, K, Na and Mg are much lower 

than in the native bioactive glass and we do not represent them in the concentration profiles 

(figure 4). 

 

 

Bioactive glass periphery after 24 h of immersion in DMEM  

The inverted darkfield STEM image shows two parts of the bioactive glass particles 

after  24  h  of  immersion  in  DMEM  (figure  5).  We  see  again  that  the  thin  “electron  dense” 

(Si,O) layer borders the glass particles all around their periphery; we can then ensure that the 

darkfield contrast corresponding to this thin layer is not due to a section artefact. Elemental 

weight concentration profiles of Si, O, Al, Ca and P reveal the presence of an another layer at 

9 

the  periphery  of  the  bioactive  glass  (figure  6).  We  observe  on  top  of  the  “electron  dense” 

(Si,O) layer a (Ca,P) layer with a Ca/P atomic ratio around unity. After the formation of the 

(Ca,P)  layer,  the  size  of  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer  decreases  and  this  layer  tends  to 

disappear. 

Bioactive glass periphery after 96 h of immersion in DMEM 

Figure  7  presents  an  inverted  darkfield  STEM  image  of  the  bioactive  glass  particles 

after 96 h of immersion in DMEM. Elemental weight concentration profiles of Si, O, Al, Ca 

and P reveal the evolution of each zone from the center to the periphery of the bioactive glass 

(figure 8). The (Ca,P) layer grows in thickness according to time and the Ca/P atomic ratio 

increases (Ca/P »

 1.4). At this delay of exposure to the biological fluid, the “electron dense” 

(Si,O)  layer  disappeared.  We  just  observe  a  (Si,O,Al)  layer  in  which  the  aluminium  weight 

concentration decreases as we approach its periphery. The O/Si atomic ratio is always around 

2 in this layer. 

O/Si and Ca/P atomic ratios in each layer 

O/Si  atomic  ratios  in  the  (Si,O,Al)  layer  and  in  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer  at 

each delay of exposure to DMEM are listed in table 1. The Ca/P ratio in the (Ca,P) layer is 

also  listed  in  table  1.  The  O/Si  ratio  in  the  (Si,O,Al)  layer  is  constant  during  exposure  to 

DMEM  and  is  slightly  larger  than  2.  The  O/Si  atomic  ratio  in  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O) 

layer  is  around  3  and  then  is  significantly  higher  than  in  the  (Si,O,Al)  layer.  It  appears 

constant  during  the  existence  of  this  temporary  layer.  The  Ca/P  ratio  in  the  (Ca,P)  layer  is 

close to unity at the beginning and increases according to time up to 1.4 at 96 h.

Importance of the absorption correction process 

Inverted darkfield STEM images and EELS measurements of local relative specimen 

thickness show the heterogeneity of the mass thickness at the periphery of the bioactive glass. 

Thus  we  must  take  into  account  this  heterogeneity  in  order  to  quantify  EDXS  spectra  with 

accuracy. The error on the O/Si atomic ratio quantification could typically attain 40% if we 

neglected  absorption  corrections  taking  into  account  the  determination  of  the  local  mass 

thickness.9  

11 

Discussion 

 

In  this  work  we  analyse  at  the  submicrometer  scale  the  elemental  weight 

concentrations of bioactive glass particles immersed into biological fluids by means of EDXS. 

These measurements are important for a better understanding of the different steps leading to 

the apatite layer formation at the bioactive glass periphery. This study requires some cautions, 

like  the  estimation  of  irradiation  damages  and  X-rays  absorption  phenomenon.  Absorption 

corrections are particularly important when light elements like oxygen are concerned. 

As the glass matrix dissolves, various elements dispersed in the bioactive glass are free 

either  to  go  into  the  solution  or  to  combine  with  other  elements  in  the  bioactive  glass  that 

make  up  surface  layers.  The  distribution  of  oxygen,  silicon,  aluminium,  calcium  and 

phosphorus  differs  between  the  glass  particle  center  and  the  newly  formed  layers  at  the 

periphery. 

Taking into account of previous knowledges 7, 19, 20 and of our present results, figure 9 

synthetizes the different steps leading to the bioactivity mechanisms. It particularly points out 

the formation of these different layers and their evolution according to time of exposure to the 

biological  solution.  In  the  same  time,  we  compare  our  steps  with  the  five  steps  giving  by 

Hench7  :  (i)  rapid  exchange  of  alkali  elements  with  H3O+  from  the  surronding  solution,  (ii) 

breakage of Si-O-Si bonds and formation of Si-OH at the glass matrix solution interface, (iii) 

condensation and repolymerization of the SiO2 surface layer, (iv) migration of Ca2+ and PO4

3- 

groups  through  the  SiO2  layer  and  the  formation  of  a  CaO-P2O5  film  on  top  of  the  SiO2 

surface layer, and (v) crystallization of the CaO-P2O5 film and formation of an apatite layer. 

 

 

 

12 

Step 1 : Bioactive glass dissolution - leaching layer  

The dissolution of the bioactive glass results from breakdown of the silica network and 

the  associated  release  of  all  elements  within  it  (including  silicon).  Thus  the  weight 

concentrations of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and potassium decrease strongly 

at the glass periphery.10 Release of sodium and potassium ions into the solution is particularly 

strong  and  rapid  which  can  be  explained  by  the  occupancy  of  the  surface  sites  by  either 

hydrogen ions or alkali ions. The release of aluminium is lower than others elements because 

it  is  firmly  bond  to  silicon.11  When  the  glass  dissolves,  most  of  Al2O3  is  bonded  to  the 

unreleased  part  of  silicon.  Thus,  the  specific  rate  of  aluminium  released  is  smaller  than  the 

corresponding  rate  of  silicon  released  because  Al2O3  is  a  network  former,  not  leached  like 

silicon.21 In the studied bioactive glass, addition of Al2O3 is used to control the solubility of 

the glass. The breakdown of the silica network and the associated release of all elements will 

move  into  the  glass  as  the  reaction  proceeds  (see  figure  9).  This  first  step  agrees  with  the 

Hench’steps which corresponds to the exchange between H3O+ ions and alkali ions. 

 

Step 2 : formation of a (Si,O,Al) layer and an “electron dense” (Si,O) layer 

These  reactions  lead  to  the  second  step  of  dissolution  which  is  the  formation  of  a 

(Si,O,Al)  layer  at  the  periphery  of  the  bioactive  glass.  We  measure,  in  this  work,  an  O/Si 

atomic  ratio  in  this  layer  around  2  which  can  be  interpreted  by  the  condensation  and  the 

repolymerisation in a SiO2 layer.7 At the periphery of the (Si,O,Al) layer, we put in evidence 

the  formation  of  a  thin  “electron  dense”  layer  composed  with  silicon  and  oxygen.  In  this 

layer,  we  measure,  in  this  work,  an  O/Si  atomic  ratio  around  3  and  the  aluminium  weight 

concentration  tends  to  zero.  Our  measured  O/Si  atomic  ratio  can  be  interpreted  by  the 

formation of Si(OH)4 groups at the periphery. The high release of alkali ions (step 1) permits 

the arrival of oxygen through an exchange with H3O+ ions from the solution. Water molecules 

13 

in  DMEM  then  or  simultaneously  react  with  the  Si-O-Si  bond  to  form  additionnal  Si-OH 

bonds.22 This second step agrees with the Hench’steps which corresponds to the breakage of 

Si-O-Si bonds. We assist in the same time to the formation of theses Si(OH)4 groups and to a 

repolymerization of theses groups under the SiO2 form. Thus, a mixed SiO2-Si(OH)4 layer is 

built  up  which  corresponds  to  the  measured  increase  of  the  O/Si  atomic  ratio.  This  step 

corresponds to the thrid Hench’step (condensation and repolymerization of the SiO2 surface 

layer) . 

 

Step 3 : formation of a (Ca,P) layer 

The  (Si,O,Al)  layer  and  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer  permit  the  diffusion  of 

calcium  and  phosphorus  up  to  the  interface  with  the  biological  fluids  which  contains  also 

calcium and phosphorus. The Si(OH)4 groups can / could ???? permit a chemical bond with 

the  calcium  which  might  replace  hydrogen  in  the  hydroxyl  bind  with  negatively  charged 

oxygen species of the silica network. Then the calcium ion is with one free valence and can 

bind with an another oxygen in the silica network or preferentially with one phosphate group. 

A (Ca,P) layer is formed on top of the “electron dense” (Si,O) layer. In this (Ca,P) layer, the 

Ca/P  atomic  ratio  is  around  unity.This  first  step  agrees  with  the  Hench’steps  which 

corresponds to the migration of Ca2+ and PO4

3- groups and the formation of a CaO-P2O5 film 

on  top  of  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer.  The  size  of  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer 

decreases  which  traduces  a  diminution  of  Si(OH)4  groups  and  this  layer  has  generally 

disappeared before 96 h. This disappearance of this layer corresponds to the end of the third 

step  given  by  Hench  (repolymerization  of  the  Si  layer  in  SiO2).  This  step  finishs  after  the 

formation of the Ca-P layer. That can be confirmed by the results obtained at the delay of 24 h 

with  the  simultaneous  presence  of  two  layers  :  the  “electron  dense”  (Si,O)  layer  and  the 

(Ca,P) layer (figures 5 and 6). 

14 

 

 

Step 4 : precipitation of the (Ca,P) layer 

The (Ca,P) layer grows in thickness according to time of exposure and its Ca/P atomic 

ratio increases. Afer 96 h, we measure a Ca/P atomic ratio around 1.4. Increasing delays will 

lead to a Ca/P atomic ratio reaching 1.7, demonstrating the precipitation of this layer into an 

apatite layer.23, 24 This last step agrees with the last step given by Hench which corresponds to 

the crystallisation of the Ca-P layer into an apatite layer. 

The  short-term  dissolution  and  physico-chemical  reactions  of  the  studied  bioactive 

glass  can  be  roughly  described  as  two  processes:  a  diffusion  through  two  siliceous  layers 

(namely (Si,O,Al) and “electron dense” (Si,O)); the occupancy of the surface sites by either 

hydrogen  ions  or  alkali  ions.  As  though  these  processes  are  clearly  separable,  they  in  fact 

occur simultaneously. Steps 1 and 2 occur very rapidly and simultaneously. In our case, the 

built-up of calcium phosphate occurs in vitro within a layer of silica gel like (a mixed SiO2-

Si(OH)4). Apatite nucleation can be triggered with the presence of the silica gel. This can be 

attributed to the characteristics of the silica gel and to the presence of Si-OH bonds. At the 

periphery  of  the  particles,  silicon  is  probably  arranged  in  the  form  of  Si(OH)4  groups, 

providing nucleation sites for the apatite formation. 

In this bioactive glass, aluminium is used to reduce dissolution and its presence is very 

low in the silica gel. This element can not be accommodated in apatite precipitates. Apatite 

nucleation is retarded and even prevented completely, when aluminium concentration in the 

native bioactive glass reaches a high enough level. In our case, it appears that 2 % Al2O3 do 

not inhibit apatite formation at the bioactive glass particles periphery. 

Different criteria can be used to predict the role of oxides added to the bioactive glass 

in  the  SiO2-CaO-P2O5-Na2O  system.  The  ionic  field  strength  can  be  a  good  criterion  to 

15 

evaluate  the  role  of  MgO,  Al2O3  and  K2O  in  the  studied  bioactive  glass.  The  ionic  field 

strength  (z/r2,  where  z  is  the  charge and r the ionic radius) is a measure of the electrostatic 

force  that  ion  can  exert  upon  neightboring  oxygens.  For  field  strength  values  starting  from 

z/r2» 5 Å-2 ions are expected to act as network formers25,  26. In our case, Al3+ act as network 

forming ion and Mg2+ could act as a network former but at a lower degree (Table 2). Other 

cations are network modifying ions. 

The  addition  of  a  network  former  oxide  like  Al2O3  reduces  the  glass  dissolution 

compare to other bioactive glasses7. This lower dissolution and the lower release in aluminum 

lead to the formation of the (Si,O,Al) layer. On the other hand, addition of network formers 

could significantly reduce the bioactivity of the material because the ability to form an apatite 

is reduced as the ionic field strength increases. This is not the case with 2% of Al2O3, in our 

study there is the formation of a (Ca,P) rich layer. Magnesium is not present in the (Si,O,Al) 

layer and do not play the role of a network former because its concentration in the glass (1% 

MgO) is to low and its field strength is under 5. 

 

16 

Conclusion 

In  the  case  of  bioactive  glasses  that  undergo  dissolution,  spatially  resolved  X-ray 

microanalysis  is  of  great  importance  in  evaluating  short-term  mechanisms  of  physico-

chemical reactions at the interface between material and biological fluids. We use a dedicated 

quantification method to obtain local elemental weight concentrations which requires EELS 

measurements  to  correct  sample  X-rays  absorption.  This  method  permits  to  determine  the 

weight  concentration  of  light  elements,  like  oxygen,  and  we  were  particularly  interested  by 

the measurements of the O/Si atomic ratios. The analysis of weight concentration variations at 

the bioactive glass particles / biological fluid gives information to a better understanding of 

the mechanisms of the apatite formation at the bioactive glass periphery. 

In  this  paper,  we  present  the  different  steps  of  the  dissolution  of  bioactive  glass 

particles  in  biological  fluids  and  for  the  first  time  to  our  knowledge  the  presence  at  the 

periphery of a thin “electron dense” (Si,O) layer with an O/Si atomic ratio larger than in the 

others layers. This thin layer could then be characterised to the presence of Si(OH)4 groups. 

The formation of the “electron dense” (Si,O) layer leads to the formation of a (Ca,P) layer on 

top  due  to  the  calcium  ion  ability  to  create  a  bond  with  the  Si(OH)4  group.  The  “electron 

dense” (Si,O) layer disappears as the (Ca,P) layer grows in thickness and finally precipitates 

in an apatite layer.

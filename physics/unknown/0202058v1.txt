Abstract

In 1687, Isaac Newton published the universal law of gravitation
stating that two bodies attract each other with a force proportional to the
product of their masses and the inverse square of the distance. The constant
of proportionality, G, is one of the fundamental constants of nature. As the
precision of measurements increased the disparity between the values of G,
gathered by different groups, surprisingly increased [1-16]. This unique
situation was reflected by the 1998 CODATA decision to increase the
relative G uncertainty from 0.013% to 0.15 % [17]. Our repetitive
measurements of the gravitational constant (G) show that G varies
significantly with the orientation of the test masses relative to the system of
fixed stars, as was predicted by the Attractive Universe Theory [18,19]. The
distances between the test masses were in the decimeter range. We have
observed that G changes with the orientation by at least 0.054%.

In 1988 two of the authors (M. L. Gershteyn and L.I. Gershteyn) published The
Attractive Universe Theory, AUT, which predicted that the gravitational force between
two bodies depends on the distribution of matter in the surrounding Universe.  Therefore,
G is a variable depending on the orientation of gravitating bodies with respect to the
system of fixed stars and it could be affected by the position of close massive bodies such
as the Sun. The dependence of G on direction in space has been named G anisotropy. The
Attractive Universe Theory suggested that G anisotropy is the main cause of the disparity
in high precision G measurements. It is necessary to note that G anisotropy on much
smaller scale (0.00002%) was proposed by Will based on Whitehead’s Gravitational
theory [20].

In 2001, the authors of this article developed a strategy to check predicted G

anisotropy by gravitational experiments conducted in Moscow under supervision of one

1

of the authors (O.V. Karagioz). We have detected G anisotropy by two independent
methods. Measurements show that the level of G anisotropy is not less than 0.054 %.

Fig.1: Schematic of dynamic torsion balance

The experiment used a dynamic torsion balance to measure G (Fig. 1). The
dynamic torsion balance consists of two masses (m=. 942 g) connected by a rod which is
suspended by a thin fiber. The torsion balance was then set into oscillatory motion in a
horizontal around the equilibrium axis O. A heavy mass (M=4,287.347 g) was placed on
O, near one end of the torsion balance and affected the period of oscillation.  The heavy
mass (M) was moved along axis O to different distances from the torsion balance,
causing the period of oscillation T to change; this change determined G .The amplitude of
the angular oscillation of the torsion balance was rather small (1.6-3.1°). The entire
mechanism was set on the floor. Thus the axis O rotated with the Earth. Given the above
setting, G anisotropy will cause the measurements of G to change synchronically with the
rotation of the Earth. If G anisotropy is connected to the system of fixed stars then the
value of G must be changing with the period of one sidereal day (23.93 hr.). G was
measured around the clock during a period of seven months. The time interval between
two consecutive measurements of G was 1.1-1.2 hr. for most (94.8%) data points.
Measurements have been performed automatically, under constant temperature
(23±0.1°C) in vacuum chamber (pressure=10-6 Pa).

The first method for identifying G anisotropy was the spectral analysis of G

measurements. Lomb’s “Least-squares frequency analysis of unequally spaced data”
[21,22] was used in the computer program created by George B. Moody [23]. The result
is a periodogram of G (Fig. 2) which has a clear absolute maximum at the period 23.89
hr.  Given the precision of the method (±0.06 hr) this period matches the sidereal day.
The amplitude of the sidereal component corresponds to a 0.054% change in G with
direction.

The second method of testing G anisotropy was developed in order to demonstrate

that the observed variation is in fact connected to the gravitational force between the
heavy mass M and the torsion balance rather than other factors. We call the second
method “the antenna for G anisotropy”. The method analyzed the amplitude of sidereal
component of period T for different positions of mass M. In presence of G anisotropy, the
force of attraction between M and the torsion balance should change with the rotation of
the Earth. The period of oscillation of the torsion balance (T) will change accordingly.
The magnitude of the variation of T given M is in a certain position will depend on the
force of attraction from mass M.  More precisely the amplitude of T’s sidereal component
should be proportional to factor Z, which is the difference between one over the square of
mean period of oscillation when M is in that position and when M is taken out.

Other periodical factors (tidal effects, seismic vibrations, temperature, etc.) in
principal can also affect the restoring torque of the fiber and thus the period of torsion
balance.  In contrast to the effect of G anisotropy, any small change in restoring torque of
the fiber will affect period in direct proportion to the value of period T itself. Accordingly
interfering periodic signals from these factors should be directly proportional to T.

In our experiment, as M is moved into different positions, the value of T changes
at a maximum of 3.2%. Thus the amplitude of the interfering signal should change by no
more than 3.2% as we vary the position of M. An interfering signal should increase as the
period T increases.

We conducted spectral analysis of measurements of torsion balance’s period T for

three different positions of the heavy mass M (Fig. 3). The results are:

1.All the periodograms have a clear absolute maximum with a period

corresponding to the sidereal day given the experimental error.

2.The amplitude of “sidereal component” increases as the distance between the

heavy mass M and the torsion balance decreases (Fig. 4).

3.When M is moved from the farthest position to the closest position the

amplitude of sidereal component of T increased by 63%.

4.The correlation coefficient between amplitude of sidereal component versus the

factor Z is 0.99.

 In other words, the experiment demonstrates that the torsion balance works as an

antenna for detecting G anisotropy signal, with the efficiency increasing when M is
moved closer to the balance. The high correlation coefficient demonstrates that the
observed effect is the result of gravitational interaction rather than any other factors. The
observed signal can not be caused by factors which affect a restoring torque of the fiber.
As stated above, an interfering signal should decrease by a maximum of 3.2 % as T
decreases; on contrary, the observed signal increases by 63% as T decreases.

The regression line in fig 4 shows that observed signal of G anisotropy contains
two components: one, which drops with distance to M, and another which is a constant,
presumably caused by the masses asymmetrically located in the laboratory.

The experimental setup allows us to make measurements only for a limited set of
directions, so measured level of G anisotropy 0.054% is only the lower estimation for this
effect. Further experiments must be performed in order to determine exact value of G in
different directions relative to the stars as well as at different magnitudes of the distance
between the gravitating masses.

Abstract 

 

 

 

 
 
 
 
 

 

 

 

All  the  natural  forces  act  through  potential  fields.  Both,  the  electromagnetic  vector 

potential and the gravitational potential of the general relativity are usually deduced starting from 

general analytic considerations. 

 

 

However,  the  nuclear  potentials  of  the  weak  and  strong  forces  are  calculated 

experimentally,  leading  to  what  is  known  as  phenomenological  potentials.  That  is  to  say, 

expressions requiring adjustments according to the experimental results. 

This  fact  may  change  if  we  consider  the  action  as  a  differential  form.  In  this  case  it  is 

possible  to  deduct  some  potentials  for  the  nuclear  forces  departing  from  general  analytic 

considerations.

Introduction 

 

When a physical system is described by an action function as a differential form [1] [2], 

from  the  geometric  standpoint  the  linear  momentum  corresponds  to  the  components  of  such  a 

differential form.  In  the  4-dimensional space-time the maximum  rank  (number  of indexes) this 

differential  form  may  have  is  four,  due  to  the  antisymmetry  of  its  components.  That  is  why,  a 

decomposition in projections on a base leads to five terms, each one with a different rank and a 

very particular physical representation. We will dedicate the 1st part of this text to this analysis. 

From  the  standpoint  of  the  analytic  physics  each  component  of  the  previous 

representation  defines  a  type  of  forces  fields.  This  way,  a  rank-zero  tensor,  being  a  scalar, 

characterises  a  mechanical  system  without  force  fields,  a  rank-1  tensor,  being  a  vector, 

characterises a field of electromagnetic type (the electromagnetic vector potential)[3]. A rank-2 

tensor, that is to say, a matrix, characterises a field of the type of the weak forces (Fermi bilineal 

currents)[4], a rank-3 tensor would characterise a field of the strong force type [5] and, finally, a 

rank-4 tensor characterises a field of gravitational type (Riemman tensor) [3]. We will dedicate 

the second part of this paper to this analysis. 

The  quantum  description  of  these  fields  is  immediately  obtained,  departing  from  the 
generalisation  of the  complementarity  principle  [1]. We  will take  care  of  this  in  the  3rd part of 

this text. 

Tensorial origin of the action function 

When  a  system  is  described  by  an  action  vector  function,  its  relationship  with  the 

traditional scalar action function is expressed by the equation [1]:

We need to know the form of the variation of the action in order to describe the space-

time evolution of the physical system. From the previous expression we find (the differentiation 

operator D corresponds to a derivative that, when applied on a tensor it results in another tensor):

which directly lead to the expression: 

This  expression  is  completely  similar  to  the  one  applied  when  the  action  has  a  tensor 

origin of arbitrary rank. In this case the expression gets the form:

This  equation  connects    the  variation  of  the  scalar  action  with  the  variation  of  the 

tensor that originates the action to which we have called “action tensor”. 

The action as function of the coordinates. 

When  we  consider  the  scalar  action  function  as  a  function  of  the  coordinates, 
meaning  S  =  S(xi),  the  form  of  the  variation  of  the  action,  according  to  the  rules  of  

differentiation is: 

dS

To find the form of DS  i we need to multiply the previous expression times its dual 

and to compare it with (1). By doing so we can see:

Same way,  we  can  calculate the  second variation  of the scalar  action. Deriving  the

derivative which, applied on a n rank tensor, it produces a n+1 rank tensor):

  it  leads  us  to  the

That it matches the corresponding mechanical expression both in classical mechanics and in

and its relationship with the momentum vector is

We  could  even  find  an  expression  for  the  differential  operator  D  that  allows  us  to 

harmonize these relationships with the space-time evolution equation for the physical system 

according to the causality principle [2][7]. For it, using the notation of differential geometry

These  expressions  are  similar  to  those  obtained  from  general  considerations 

regarding the application of causality to the physical systems [2]. 

 
Since  dnS is a differential n-form on  a  space  with four dimensions, the highest 

value  for  n  is  also  4.  That  is  to  say:  the  maximum  number  of  indexes  the  linear 

momentum could have is four.

Breakdown of the momentum 

in function of a given vector. 

Let us suppose that we have a unitary vector u (uiui = 1). Given this vector we 

can  always  breakdown  the  n-tensor  momentum  according  to  its  projections  on  the 

components of u, in the way:

Being C a tensor form of the perpendicular manifold to vector u. 

When  the  momentum  is  a  scalar,  the  expression  (4)  simplifies  down  to  the 
identity  P  =  C.  Keeping  in  mind  the  symmetry  of  the  product  uiuj  =  ujui,  in  the

Below we will analyse some physical systems using this equations. Each system 

has one of the fundamental forces. We will observe that all fundamental forces can be 

described by an action expressed as differential n-form.

PART 2 

Analysis of physical systems. 

a)  homogeneous and isotropic systems. 

A homogeneous and isotropic physical system is characterised totally by a scalar 

physical magnitude [7]. Therefore the action will be a linear function in the interval s. 

That is to say: S = − P·s.  

The scalar magnitude that characterises the homogeneous and isotropic system is 
usually called mass, for this reason P ∝ m. The proportionality constant between P and 

m,  with  units  of  speed,  should  then  be  a  constant  value  in  any  inertial  frame  of 

reference. This value can only be the speed of light c. Therefore, our physical system is 

characterised by the following expression of the action: 

S

−=

smc

=⇔⋅

P

mc

 

(5)

b) System composed by a single free particle.  

Although, in a strict sense a particle having mass cannot be free, since the non 

homogeneous  distribution  of  mass  in  the  system,  due  to  the  presence  of  the  particle, 

leads  by  itself  to  an  alteration  in  the  metric  of  the  system,  we  will  consider,  for  the 

moment, that such alteration is negligible in view of the magnitudes that we will deal 

with. 

Since we have characterised the system by the presence of a “free” particle with 

idle  mass  m,  this  particle  will  characterise  a  direction  of  the  space  as  preferable.  This 

direction will correspond to the variation in the position of the particle when it moves 

from a point X to the point X + dX. Since the system is free, such variation can only be 

referred to the interval. 

 

 

 

7 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By  representing  the  variation  in  the  coordinate  xi  by  dxi,  we  define  the  unitary 

vector 

u

i =

i

dx
ds

 as the 4dimensional speed. It is easy to see that its form is: 





v

y
c

v
z
c





 

i

u

=

1

−

1

2

2

v
c

Being  (vx,  vy,  vz)  the  traditional  three-dimensional  speed  vector.  By  applying  the 

equation (2) we get 

i

P =

i

Pu

. As by hypothesis we have considered that the presence of 

the particle does not break the homogeneity and  isotropy of the system (its effects are 

negligible), knowing that 

mc

 we obtain the expression: 

P =

dS

−=

i
dxP

i

⇔

i

P

=

mcu

i

 

(6)

Or also: 

dS

i

−=

Pdx

i

=⇔

P

mc

 

This  tells  us  that,  when  we  have  a  free  particle,  the  4-speed  of  the  particle 

characterises the system. That is to say, the unit vector u shows us a direction regarding 

which we can decompose or break our system down. 

When  the  particle  is  only  characterised  by  its  scalar  magnitude  (its  mass),  the 

linear momentum, as a description of the system can only be a function of the 4-speed 

and  of  the  mass.  Under  these  conditions  the  system  is  called  mechanic  and  all  its 

properties, such  as the conservation  principles or its movement  equations  are deduced 

from the equation: 

When  we  substitute  Pi  by  its  traditional  expression 

Si∂−

  we  obtain  the  equations  of 

Hamilton-Jacobi.

c)  System  composed  by  a  particle 

in  a  vector 

field.  The 

electromagnetic field.  

A  vector  field  is  characterised  by  a  vector  potential  having  the  form  Ci. 

Following the breakdown (4), for n = 1 the momentum can be decomposed, according 

to the 4-speed vector in the form:

magnitude that characterises the particle. We have 

i

C ∝

eA

 , being e what is known as 

the electric charge of the particle. 

 

Since C has units of Mass × Speed, while eA has units of Energy, that is to say, 
Mass  ×  Speed2,  the  proportionality  constant  should  have  units  of  Speed-1.  Given  the 

independence  of  the  reference  system,  the  only  constant  that  we  can  use  is  1/c. 

Therefore:

d) System for a rank 4 field tensor. Gravitational field.  

For  n  =  4,  we  will  assume  that,  the  only  part  of  the  linear  momentum  that  is 

different  from  zero  is  (in  n  =  4  there  is  only  a  collection  of  4-indexes  linearly 

independent):

From this, it is easy to obtain the equations of the gravitational field by rewriting 

it in a more familiar way. In General Relativity, the density of the 4-tensor field is called 

tensor  of  Riemann.  It  is  denoted  by:  Rijkl  and  its  contraction,  expressed  as  Rik  is  the 

tensor of Ricci, Due to this, the tensors Rik and the 4-density of Cik must be proportional 

to each other. 

 

Pik. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  energy-momentum  tensor  Tik  commonly  used  in  the 

classic  theory  of  fields  [3]  has  the  form 

−=

T
ik

,  being: 

u⋅Λ=Λ

dimensional  density  of  the  scalar  action,  or  the  same  thing  as  the  three-dimensional 

density of the lagrangian). According to this, the tensor Tik is the density of the tensor 

Taking into account the former two reasonings, the equation (11) becomes: 

The proportionality constant will be such that, for small values of R this equation 

matches the Newton’s expression of the gravitation. Making this approximation we find 

the constant

Nuclear forces: Weak and strong fields. 

Although, the analysis we have made up to this point has not taken into account 

the  mathematical  realisation.  It  is  certain  that  the  description  of  the  weak  and  strong 

forces only makes full sense inside a quantum framework. 

However, the field equations for the linear momentum expressed as differential 

n-form  lead  us  to  tensor  components  of  2nd  and  3rd  order  whose  expressions  may 

match with those of the strong and weak force field types. 

The  application  of  the  principle  of  correspondence  into  these  equations  [1],  as 

well  as  a  mathematical-interpretative  quantum-relativistic  analysis  will  lead  our  field 

equations to the correct expressions corresponding to the nuclear forces. 

e) System composed by a matrix field. Weak field. 

Based  on  expression  (8)  we  can  observe  that,  as  CijCij  is  an  invariant,  we  can 
find  a  vector  J  such  that  CijCij=Ja  Ja.  This  vector  J  is  traditionally  called  4-vectorial 

weak current, and due to (11) 

dS

∫∝

αJJ

. 

α

 

 

 

 

The most peculiar characteristic of the weak force is the non-conservation of the 

symmetry of parity [9]. 

 
The system formed by the matrix field is characterized by: Cij. In presence of a 

particle the  expression  of the action should have the form of the equation (8), plus  an 

additional term due to the matrix component. We will concentrate on this last term.

PART 3. 

Quantum-relativistic extension 

We  could  not  complete  a  description  of  the  nuclear  forces,  or  a  complete 

description  of  the  electromagnetic  and  gravitational  fields  if  we  wouldn’t  make  a 

quantum-relativistic extension for our field equations. 

In quantum-relativistic physics the described objects are expressed by means of 

spinorial wave functions. Instead of Dirac’s spinorial notation, we will here follow the 

spinor notation corresponding to the co-variant transformations [1]. In this notation the 

wave function mathematical object verifies the relationship: 

i

1=ΨΨ

 . 

i

Departing  from  the  expression  of  the  metric 

  and  reminding  the 

i

expression of the 4-speed as: 

u

,  we obtain

. The analogy between this 

i =

i

expression  and  the  relationship  for  the  wave  function  leads  us  to  the  transformation 

iu

Ψ→ . 

i

On  the  other  hand,  the  generalization  of  the  principle  of  complementarity  [1] 

allows us to find the transformation for the linear momentum: 

P

ij

−→

Di
h

i

Ψ

j

. 

Applying  these  two  transformations  to  the  field  equations  we  obtain  the 

quantum-relativistic extension. This way, applying it to (6) we obtain: 

−

h

Ψ=Ψ
j mc

This is Dirac’s equation [10] in covariant notation. 

Likewise,  the  expression  for  the  strong  force:

Finally, for the gravitational field case, we should find an equivalent relationship 

to  the  one  of  the  principle  of  complementarity,  that  transforms  for  us  the  metric  into 

wave functions. On that purpose, being that: 

 

 

Starting with (11) we arrive to:

This equation connects the Riemman´s tensor (the space-time deformation) and 

the wave function. That is to say, the wave function deforms the space-time. This result 

is evident when we consider that, according to general relativity, the mass deforms the 

space and that, according to quantum mechanics, every particle is described by a wave 

function.  Consequently,  the  very  wave  function  deforms  the  space-time.  The  last 

equation says exactly that same thing. 

Thanks to Jorge Millán Ayala for taking interest in this work and for the help he 

provided with the English language by revising the last version of this paper.

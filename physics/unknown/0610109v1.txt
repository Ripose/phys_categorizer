Draft of 13 October 2006.

We carry out climate simulations for 1880-2003 with GISS modelE driven by ten measured 
or estimated climate forcings. An ensemble of climate model runs is carried out for each forcing 
acting individually and for all forcing mechanisms acting together. We compare side-by-side 
simulated climate change for each forcing, all forcings, observations, unforced variability 
among model ensemble members, and, if available, observed variability. Discrepancies between 
observations and simulations with all forcings are due to model deficiencies, inaccurate or 
incomplete forcings, and imperfect observations. Although there are notable discrepancies 
between model and observations, the fidelity is sufficient to encourage use of the model for 
simulations of future climate change. By using a fixed well-documented model and accurately 
defining the 1880-2003 forcings, we aim to provide a benchmark against which the effect of 
improvements in the model, climate forcings, and observations can be tested. Principal model 
deficiencies include unrealistically weak tropical El Nino-like variability and a poor distribution 
of sea ice, with too much sea ice in the Northern Hemisphere and too little in the Southern 
Hemisphere. The greatest uncertainties in the forcings are the temporal and spatial variations 
of anthropogenic aerosols and their indirect effects on clouds. We present evidence that the 
apparent model-observation discrepancy after the 1883 Krakatau eruption is due at least in part to 
deficiencies in observational analyses, as the model results sampled at locations of meteorological 
stations are in good agreement with observations.

Introduction

 
Global warming has become apparent in recent years, with 
the average surface temperature in 2005 about 0.8°C higher than 
in the late 1800s [Hansen et al., 2006a]. There is strong evidence 
that much of this warming is due to human-made climate forcing 
agents, especially infrared-absorbing (greenhouse) gases [IPCC,

2001].  Concern  about  human-made  climate  alterations  led  to 
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
[United  Nations,  1992]  with  the  agreed  objective  “to  achieve 
stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere 
at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interfer-
ence with the climate system.”
The Earth’s climate system has great thermal inertia, yield-
 
ing a climate response time of at least several decades for chang-
es of atmosphere and surface climate forcing agents [Hansen et 
al., 1984]. Thus there is a need to anticipate the nature of an-
thropogenic climate change and define the level of change con-
stituting  dangerous  interference  with  nature.  Simulations  with 
global climate models on the century time scale provide a tool 
for  addressing  this  need.  Climate models  used  for  simulations 
of future climate must be tested by means of simulations of past 
climate change.
 
Our present paper describes simulations for 1880-2003 made 
with GISS atmospheric modelE [Schmidt et al., 2006], hereafter 
modelE  [2006],  specifically  model  III,  the  version  of  modelE 
“frozen” in mid-2004 for use in the 2007 IPCC assessment. This 
same model III version of modelE has been documented via a 
large set of simulations used to investigate the “efficacy” of vari-
ous climate forcings [Hansen et al., 2005a], hereafter Efficacy 
[2005].
 

Efficacy [2005] and the present paper both include  use of

the same 10 climate forcings. In Efficacy [2005] each forcing is 
based on the fixed 1880-2000 change of the forcing agent, and 
the mean climate response for years 81-120 is examined to max-
imize signal/noise. The present paper uses the “transient” (time-
dependent) forcings for 1880-2003. These transient simulations 
are  extended  to  2100,  and  in  a  few  cases  to  2300,  for  several 
GHG scenarios by Hansen et al. [2006b, hereafter Dangerous, 
2006] in an analysis of potential “dangerous anthropogenic in-
terference” with climate.
 
Detailed  diagnostics  for  several  of  these  simulations  are 
available from the repository for IPCC runs (www-pcmdi.llnl.
gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php). Diagnostics for all of these runs, in-
cluding convenient graphics, are available at data.giss.nasa.gov/
modelE/transient.
 
Our figures with results for each forcing contain many small 
parts,  yet  the  figure  size  is  sufficient  for  intended  interpreta-
tions,  which  emphasize  planetary  scale  features  in  the  climate 
response. Indeed, the figures are a pithy alternative to detailed 
tables and discussion. We note that the figures were designed for 
reproduction at full resolution as in Efficacy [2005]. Colors are 
slightly  washed-out  and  figure  borders  and  lines  become  thin 
in  compression  schemes  used  to  keep  data  volume  moderate 
for ArXiv and some other electronic publications. These effects 
can be minimized in future papers if original lines are slightly 
thicker and colors darker. Full resolution versions of this paper 
and Dangerous [2006] are available on the GISS web site.
Section 2 defines the climate model and summarizes prin-
 
cipal known deficiencies. Section 3 defines time-dependent cli-
mate forcings and discusses their uncertainties. Section 4 exam-
ines  alternative  ways  of  sampling  the  model’s  simulated  tem-
perature  change  for  comparison  with  imperfect  observations. 
Section  5  compares  simulated  and  observed  climate  change 
for  1880-2003,  focusing  on  temperature  change  but  including 
other  climate  variables.  Section  6  summarizes  the  capabilities 
and  limitations  of  the  current  simulations  and  suggests  efforts 
that  are  needed  to  improve  future  capabilities.  The Appendix 
describes “lessons learned”, i.e., minor errors in the forcings or 
flaws in the experimental setup, with the aim of minimizing such 
problems in future simulations.

2. Climate Model

2.1.   Atmospheric Model
The atmospheric model employed here is the 20-layer ver-
 
sion of GISS modelE [2006] with 4°x5° horizontal resolution. 
This resolution is coarse, but use of second-order moments for 
numerical differencing improves the effective resolution for the 
transport of tracers. The model top is at 0.1 hPa. Minimal drag 
is applied in the stratosphere, as needed for numerical stability, 
without gravity wave modeling. Stratospheric zonal winds and 
temperature are generally realistic [Figure 17 in Efficacy, 2005], 
but the polar lower stratosphere is as much as 5-10°C too cold in 
the winter and the model produces sudden stratospheric warm-
ings at only a quarter of the observed frequency. Model capabili-
ties and limitations are described in Efficacy [2005] and modelE 
[2006]. Deficiencies are summarized below (section 2.4).
2.2.   Ocean Representations
  We  find  it  instructive  to  attach  the  identical  atmospheric 
model  to  alternative  ocean  representations.  We  make  calcula-
tions with time-dependent 1880-2003 climate forcings with the 
atmosphere attached to:
 

(1) Ocean A, which uses observed sea surface temperature 

(SST) and sea ice (SI). Three 5-member ensembles are run for 
1880-2004: (a) SST and SI vary, but climate forcings are fixed 
at 1880 values, (b) SST, SI, and climate forcings are all time-
dependent,  (c)  SST  and  forcings  vary,  but  SI  is  fixed  with  its 
1880 seasonal variation (note that in all cases SI in ocean A is 
unchanging from 1880 to 1900, because the Rayner et al. [2003] 
sea ice data set begins in 1900).
(2) Ocean B, the Q-flux ocean [Hansen et al., 1984; Rus-
 
sell et al., 1985], with specified horizontal ocean heat transports 
inferred  from  the  ocean A  control  run  and  diffusive  uptake  of 
heat anomalies by the deep ocean. One 5-member ensemble is 
carried out for 1880-2003 with all climate forcings.
(3)  Ocean  C,  the  dynamic  ocean  model  of  Russell  et  al. 
 
[1995];  many  simulations  are  carried  out  with  this  model  for 
1880-2003,  including  ensembles  with  each  individual  climate 
forcing as well as all forcings acting together. Runs with all forc-
ings have been extended to 2100 and 2300 with several differ-
ent post-2003 climate forcing scenarios [Dangerous, 2006]. One 
merit of the Russell et al. [1995] ocean model is its computa-
tional efficiency. It adds negligible computation time to that for 
the atmosphere, when the ocean resolution is the same as that for 
the atmosphere, as is the case here. The ocean model has 13 lay-
ers of geometrically increasing thickness, four of these in the top 
100 m. The ocean model employs the KPP parameterization for 
vertical mixing [Large et al., 1994] and the Gent-McWilliams 
parameterization for eddy-induced tracer transports [Gent et al., 
1995; Griffies, 1998]. The Russell et al. [1995] ocean model pro-
duces a realistic thermohaline circulation [Sun and Bleck, 2006], 
but yields unrealistically weak El Nino-like tropical variability 
as a result of its coarse resolution.
(4) Ocean D, the Bleck [2002] HYCOM ocean model. Re-
 
sults for this coupled model with all forcings acting at once will 
be presented elsewhere.
The merits and rationale for organizing the climate change 
 
investigation this way, including use of alternative ocean repre-
sentations  with  identical  atmospheric  model  and  forcings,  are 
discussed by Hansen et al. [1997a].
2.3.   Model Sensitivity
 
The  model  has  sensitivity  2.7°C  for  doubled  CO2  when 
coupled  to  the  Q-flux  ocean  [Efficacy,  2005],  but  2.9°C  when 
coupled to the Russell et al. [1995] dynamical ocean. The slight-
ly  higher  sensitivity  with  ocean  C  became  apparent  when  the 
model run was extended to 1000 years, as the sea ice contribu-
tion to climate change became more important relative to other 
feedbacks  as  the  high  latitude  ocean  temperatures  approached 
equilibrium. The 2.9°C sensitivity corresponds to ~0.7°C per W/
m2. In the coupled model with the Russell et al. [1995] ocean the 
response to a constant forcing is such that 50% of the equilib-
rium response is achieved in ~25 years, 75% in ~150 years, and 
the equilibrium response is approached only after several hun-
dred years. Runs of 1000 years and longer are available upon re-
quest. The model’s climate sensitivity of 2.7-2.9°C for doubled 
CO2  is  well  within  the  empirical  range  of  3±1°C  for  doubled 
CO2 that has been inferred from paleoclimate evidence [Hansen 
et al., 1984, 1993; Hoffert and Covey, 1992].
2.4.		 Principal	Model	Deficiencies
  ModelE [2006] compares the atmospheric model climatol-
ogy  with  observations.  Model  shortcomings  include  ~25%  re-
gional  deficiency  of  summer  stratus  cloud  cover  off  the  west 
coast  of  the  continents  with  resulting  excessive  absorption  of 
solar radiation by as much as 50 W/m2, deficiency in absorbed

solar radiation and net radiation over other tropical regions by 
typically 20 W/m2, sea level pressure too high by 4-8 hPa in the 
winter in the Arctic and 2-4 hPa too low in all seasons in the trop-
ics, ~20% deficiency of rainfall over the Amazon basin, ~25% 
deficiency in summer cloud cover in the western United States 
and central Asia with a corresponding ~5°C excessive summer 
warmth in these regions. In addition to the inaccuracies in the 
simulated climatology, another shortcoming of the atmospheric 
model  for  climate  change  studies  is  the  absence  of  a  gravity 
wave representation, as noted above, which may affect the na-
ture  of  interactions  between  the  troposphere  and  stratosphere. 
The stratospheric variability is less than observed, as shown by 
analysis of the present 20-layer 4°x5° atmospheric model by J. 
Perlwitz  [personal  communication].  In  a  50-year  control  run 
Perlwitz finds that the interannual variability of seasonal mean 
temperature in the stratosphere maximizes in the region of the 
subpolar jet streams at realistic values, but the model produces 
only  six  sudden  stratospheric  warmings  (SSWs)  in  50  years, 
compared with about one every two years in the real world.
 
The  coarse  resolution  Russell  ocean  model  has  realistic 
overturning  rates  and  inter-ocean  transports  [Sun  and  Bleck, 
2006], but tropical SST has less east-west contrast than observed 
and the model yields only slight El Nino-like variability [Figure 
17, Efficacy, 2005]. Also the Southern Ocean is too well-mixed 
near Antarctica [Liu et al., 2003], while deep water production 
in the North Atlantic does not go deep enough, and some deep-
water formation occurs in the Sea of Okhotsk region, probably 
because  of  unrealistically  small  freshwater  input  there  in  the 
model III version of modelE. Global sea ice cover is realistic, 
but this is achieved with too much sea ice in the Northern Hemi-
sphere  and  too  little  sea  ice  in  the  Southern  Hemisphere,  and 
the seasonal cycle of sea ice is too damped with too much ice 
remaining  in  the Arctic  summer,  which  may  affect  the  nature 
and distribution of sea ice climate feedbacks.
 
Despite these model limitations, in IPCC model inter-com-
parisons the model used for the simulations reported here, i.e, 
modelE with the Russell ocean, fares about as well as the typi-
cal global model in the verisimilitude of its climatology. Com-
parisons so far include the ocean’s thermohaline circulation [Sun 
and Bleck, 2006], the ocean’s heat uptake [Forest et al., 2006], 
the  atmosphere’s  annular  variability  and  response  to  forcings 
[Miller et al., 2006], and radiative forcing calculations [Collins 

et al., 2006]. The ability of the GISS model to match climatol-
ogy, compared with other models, varies from being better than 
average on some fields (radiation quantities, upper tropospheric 
temperature) to poorer than average on others (stationary wave 
activity, sea level pressure).

3. Climate Forcings

 
The climate forcings that drive our simulated climate change 
arise  from  changing  well-mixed  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs), 
ozone  (O3),  stratospheric  H2O  from  methane  (CH4)  oxidation, 
tropospheric aerosols, specifically, sulfates, nitrates, black car-
bon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), a parameterized indirect ef-
fect  of  aerosols  on  clouds,  volcanic  aerosols,  solar  irradiance, 
soot effect on snow and ice albedos, and land use changes. Larg-
est forcings on the century time scale are for GHGs and aero-
sols, including the aerosol indirect effect. Ozone global forcing 
is significant on the century time scale, and the more uncertain 
solar forcing may also be important. Volcanic effects are large 
on shorter time scales, and the clustering of volcanoes contrib-
utes to decadal climate variability. The soot effect on snow and 
ice albedos and land use change are small on global average, but 
they are large forcings on regional scales.
Global  maps  of  the  1880-2003  changes  of  these  forcings 
 
are provided in Efficacy [2005]. In this section we define the as-
sumed atmospheric, surface or irradiance changes that give rise 
to the forcings, show the time dependence of global mean forc-
ing for each mechanism, and provide partly subjective estimates 
of the uncertainties.
  We tabulate forcings for several forcing definitions for the 
sake  of  analysis  and  comparison  with  other  investigations.  Fi, 
Fa,  Fs,  and  Fe  are,  respectively,  the  instantaneous,  adjusted, 
fixed SST (sea surface temperature), and effective forcings [Effi-
cacy, 2005]. Fi, Fa and Fs are a priori forcings. The a posteriori 
forcing Fe is inferred from a long climate simulation, thus ac-
counting in a limited way for the efficacy of each specific forc-
ing mechanism. Fe is based on the 100-year response of global 
mean temperature, so of course it cannot make different forcing 
mechanisms equivalent in their regional climate responses. The 
various forcing mechanisms differ in effectiveness primarily be-
cause of their varying locations in latitude or altitude [Hansen et 
al.,1997b, Ramaswamy et al., 2001]. Even the nominally “well-
mixed” GHGs differ in their efficacies, because of spatial gra-

dients in their amounts and the spectral location of absorptions 
[Efficacy, 2005].
 
Fi  is  the  easiest  forcing  to  compute,  but  in  some  cases  it 
provides a poor measure of the expected climate response. Fa 
has been used widely, e.g., by IPCC [1996, 2001] and Hansen et 
al. [1997b]. Fa is the conventional standard forcing, in which the 
stratospheric temperature is allowed to adjust to the presence of 
the forcing agent. Fi and Fa, involving only atmospheric radia-
tion, can be calculated rapidly with precise results for a given 
model, but it is not practical to compute them for some forcing 
mechanisms such as the indirect aerosol effect. Fs can be com-
puted  with  a  (fixed  SST)  global  climate  model  for  all  forcing 
mechanisms, but accurate evaluation requires a long model run 
because of unforced atmospheric variability. Fe, dependent on 
the simulated response of a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate 
model, requires even more computer resources for accurate defi-
nition because of greater unforced variability in coupled mod-
els.

 
Fi, Fa, Fs and Fe form a sequence that usually should pro-
vide successively better predictions of the climate model global 
response  to  a  given  forcing  mechanism,  because  each  forcing 
incorporates further climate feedback mechanisms. For this rea-
son, the forcings are successively more model-dependent, and 
tabulation of several forcings aids comparison and analysis of 
climate responses from different models.
3.1.   Greenhouse gases
3.1.1. Well-mixed GHGs. Temporal changes of long-lived 
 
GHGs can be approximated as globally uniform. Global mean 
values of gas amounts, from Table 1 of Hansen and Sato [2004]

tained from  appropriate area weighting of  in  situ  and  ice core 
measurements  at  specific  sites,  as  described  by  Hansen  and 
Sato  [2004]. Trace  gas  measurements  are  from  Montzka  et  al. 
[1999], as updated at ftp://ftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/hats/Total_Cl_Br. 
Gas amounts are converted to forcings (Fa), for IPCC and alter-
native scenarios, using ModelE radiation code, except the mi-

nor MPTGs (Montreal Protocol Trace Gases) and OTGs (Other 
Trace Gases), which use conversion factors provided by IPCC 
[2001]. The gas amounts are shown in Figure 2 of Dangerous 
[2006] and resulting forcings in Figure 1 here. The 1880-2003 
adjusted forcing for well-mixed GHGs is Fa = 2.50 W/m2. Ef-
ficacy is greater than unity for CH4, N2O and the CFCs [Efficacy, 
2005], yielding an effective forcing for well-mixed GHGs Fe = 
2.72 W/m2.
 
Figure 1 summarizes climate forcings by well-mixed GHGs 
and the annual growth of this forcing. The growth rate declined 
from 5 W/m2 per century 25 years ago to 3½ W/m2 per century 
more recently as the growth of MPTGs and CH4 declined.
3.1.2. Other greenhouse gases. The principal short-lived, 
 
and  thus  inhomogeneously  mixed,  anthropogenic  greenhouse 
gas is ozone (O3). O3 change of the past century includes both a 
long-term tropospheric O3 increase due mainly to human-made 
changes  of  CH4,  NOX  (nitrogen  oxides),  CO  (carbon  monox-
ide), and VOCs (volatile organic compounds), and O3 depletion 
(mainly  in  the  stratosphere)  in  recent  decades  due  to  human-
made Cl and Br compounds (halogens). The tropospheric histor-
ical O3 change in our climate simulation is from a chemistry cli-
mate model [Shindell et al., 2003] driven by prescribed changes 
of O3 precursor emissions and climate conditions. Stratospheric 
O3 change in recent decades is included based on observational 
analyses  of  Randel  and  Wu  [1999].  Some  influence  of  strato-
spheric O3 depletion on tropospheric O3 change is included by 
extrapolating O3 trends in the Antarctic all the way to the surface 
and reducing O3 growth rates in the Arctic troposphere. 
 
Figure  2  shows  the  global  mean  total  O3  versus  time,  the 
O3 change as a function of altitude and latitude for the periods 
1880-1979 and 1979-1997, and the stratosphere and troposphere 
O3 changes for these same periods as a function season and lati-
tude. The resulting O3 adjusted forcing, with global average 0.28 
W/m2  over  1880-2003,  is  illustrated  in  Figure  10b  of  Efficacy 
[2005].
Note that in the GISS climate simulations delivered to IPCC 
 
in mid-2004 the Randel and Wu [1999] decadal rate of O3 deple-
tion  was  inadvertently  treated  as  the  18-year  change,  i.e.,  the 
stratospheric O3 depletion was only 5/9 as large as intended. We 
use the corrected runs here. Both the original and corrected runs 
are now available from the IPCC and GISS web sites. The global 
average 1880-2003 O3 forcing was Fa = 0.31 W/m2 in the origi-

nal run and Fa = 0.28 W/m2 in the corrected run.
Future stratospheric O3 may increase as halogens decline in 
 
abundance as a result of emission constraints, but the O3 amount 
will also be affected by climate change. Tropospheric O3 would 
increase  strongly  for  most  IPCC  [2001]  scenarios  of  CH4  and 
other O3 precursors [Gauss et al., 2003]. However, it is possi-
ble that efforts to control air pollution and climate change may 
result in tropospheric O3 levels leveling off or even declining. 
Given that future O3 changes are highly uncertain and probably 
not a dominant forcing, we keep O3 in our simulations of the 21st 
century fixed at the 1997 values [Hansen et al., 2002].
The other inhomogeneously mixed anthropogenic GHG in-
 
cluded in our climate simulations is CH4-derived stratospheric 
H2O. Production of stratospheric H2O, based on the two-dimen-
sional model of Fleming et al. [1999], is proportional to tropo-
spheric  CH4  amount  with  a  two-year  lag. As  shown  in  Figure 
9  of  Efficacy  [2005]  CH4-derived  H2O  increases  stratospheric 
H2O amount from about 3 ppmv to as much as 6-7 ppmv in the 
upper  stratosphere.  Simulated  H2O  is  in  good  agreement  with 
observations in the lower stratosphere, which is the region that 
is important for causing climate forcing. Climate forcing due to 
CH4-derived H2O for 1880-2000 is about 0.06 W/m2.
Change in the total greenhouse gas effective climate forcing 
 
between 1880 and 2003 is Fe ~ 3.0 W/m2 (Table 1). Our partly 
subjective estimate of uncertainty, including imprecision in gas 
amounts and radiative transfer is ~±15%, i.e., ±0.45 W/m2. Com-
parisons with line-by-line radiation calculations [A. Lacis and V. 
Oinas,  priv.  comm.]  suggest  that  CO2,  CH4  and  N2O  forcings 
in the climate model are each accurate within several percent, 
but  the  CFC  forcing  may  be  30-40%  too  large.  If  that  correc-
tion is needed, it will reduce our estimated GHG forcing to Fe 
~ 2.9 W/m2. The documented version of modelE, employed for 
simulations  reported  here,  in  modelE  [2006],  Efficacy  [2005], 
and Dangerous [2006] has GHG forcings as defined in Table 1 
here and Figure 2 of Dangerous [2006].

and  OC  are  from  an  aerosol-climate  model  [Koch,  2001]  that 
uses  estimated  anthropogenic  aerosol  emissions  based  on  fuel 
use  statistics  and  includes  temporal  changes  in  fossil  fuel  use 
technologies [Novakov et al., 2003], but the BC and OC amounts 
are normalized by time and space independent factors defined 
below. BC and OC sources are fossil fuels and biomass burning, 
including agricultural fires that occur mainly in the tropics, and 
forest fires that occur mainly in Asia and North America. Aero-
sols from biofuels are not included. OC emissions are taken as 
proportional to BC emissions, with the OM/BC mass ratio being 
4  for  fossil  fuels  and  7.9  for  biomass  burning,  where  it  is  as-
sumed that the organic matter OM = 1.3xOC. The OC/BC ratios 
are reduced further, by a small amount, via separate normaliza-
tion factors for OC and BC defined below. The emission ratios 
are intended to implicitly account for secondary OC formation 
[Koch,  2001].  Global  aerosol  distributions  are  computed  with 
the  transport  model  for  1850,  1875,  1900,  1925,  1950,  1960, 
1970, 1980, 1990, interpolated linearly between these dates, and 
kept constant after 1990.
 
Aerosols are approximated as externally mixed for radiative 
calculations. Absorption by BC is increased a factor of two over 
that  calculated  for  external  mixing  to  approximate  enhance-
ment  of  absorption  that  accompanies  realistic  internal  mixing 
of BC with other aerosol compositions [Chylek et al., 1995]. BC 
and OC masses of Koch [2001] were multiplied by 1.9 and 1.6, 
respectively,  to  obtain  best  correspondence  with  multispectral 
AERONET  observations  [Sato  et  al.,  2003]. The  GISS  model 
includes the effect of humidity on sulfate, nitrate and OC aerosol 
sizes [modelE, 2006], which increases aerosol optical thickness 
and radiative forcing.
Andreae  and  Gelenser  [2006]  describe  widespread  occur-
 
rence of “brown carbon”, produced especially by biomass burn-
ing.  Brown  carbon  is  not  included  as  an  aerosol  per  se  in  our 
modeling,  but  it  is  approximated  by  the  combination  of  black 
and organic carbon. Spectral variation of absorption by organic 
carbon is based on measurements of Kirschstetter et al. [2004]. 
Although  more  detailed  treatment  of  carbonaceous  aerosols  is 
desirable, it is difficult to justify that with current measurement 
limitations [Novakov et al., 2005]. 
Dry nitrate in 1990 is from Liao et al. [2004], with nitrate at 
 
other times proportional to global population (www.un.org.pop-
ulation). The assumed nitrate aerosol size distribution has effec-
tive radius 0.3 μm and effective variance 0.2. The nitrate aerosol 
refractive index at 633nm wavelength is from Tang [1996] and 
Tang and Munkelwitz [1991], with spectral variation the same as 
for sulfuric acid. 
Figure  3b  shows  the  1990  clear-sky  and  cloudy-sky  (i.e., 
 
global  mean)  optical  thickness  of  aerosols  in  the  model.  The 
cloudy-sky  aerosol  optical  thickness,  because  of  higher  hu-
midity in cloudy gridboxes, is twice the clear-sky case, but the 
clear-sky value is appropriate for comparison with observations. 
Figure 3b also shows the aerosol adjusted forcing, Fa, and the 
reduction of downward solar radiation at the surface due to aero-
sols. The left side of Figure 3b is the effect of all aerosols present 
in 2000, while the right side shows the change between 1850 and 
2000.
 
The aerosol effective forcing, i.e., the product Fe = EaFa, 
varies with aerosol type (Table 2 in Efficacy, 2005). Fe differs 
notably from Fa for BC aerosols, as the efficacy of BC is less 
than 100%. The efficacy depends on the vertical and geographi-
cal distribution of the BC, with the reduction of forcing being 
greater for biomass burning BC (E ~ 60%) than for fossil fuel 

BC (E ~ 80%) [Efficacy, 2005]. Figure 3c shows the time depen-
dence of the global mean aerosol optical thickness and effective 
forcing.
3.2.2. Aerosol indirect effect. We use the same aerosol in-
 
direct effect on clouds as in Efficacy [2005], i.e., a parameter-
ization  based  on  empirical  effects  of  aerosols  on  cloud  drop-
let  number  concentration  [Menon  and  Del  Genio,  2006].  It  is 
concluded in Efficacy [2005], based on empirical evidence, that 
the predominant aerosol indirect effect occurs via cloud cover 
change, and it is argued that the global-mean magnitude of the 
indirect aerosol forcing, in recent years relative to 1850, is of the 
order of -1 W/m2, with a largely subjective estimate of uncer-
tainty of at least 50%.
The aerosol indirect effect, as defined by this parameteriza-
 
tion, depends on the logarithm of the concentration of soluble 
aerosols  and  thus  the  effect  is  non-linear,  with  added  aerosols 
becoming  relatively  less  effective  as  their  number  increases. 
Time-dependent  aerosols  are  anthropogenic  sulfates,  BC,  OC 
and nitrates, as shown in Figure 3. Maps of the resulting aerosol 
indirect forcing are provided in Efficacy [2005].
The  net  1880-2003  direct  aerosol  forcing  in  our  transient 
 
climate  simulations  (Table  1)  is  Fa  =  -0.38  W/m2  and  Fe  =  -
0.60 W/m2. The total aerosol forcing including the indirect effect 
is  Fe  =  -1.37 W/m2.  Empirical  data  for  checking  model-based 
temporal changes of tropospheric aerosol amount, e.g., ice core 
records [IPCC, 2001; Hansen et al., 2004], are meager. There is 
a wide spread in aerosol properties inferred from current satel-
lite sensors, but more accurate results are anticipated from fu-
ture polarization measurements designed to retrieve aerosol and 
cloud particle properties [Mishchenko et al., 2004, 2006]. Our 
largely subjective estimate of the uncertainty in the net aerosol 
forcing is at least 50%.
3.2.3. Stratospheric aerosols. The history of stratospheric 
 
aerosol  optical  thickness  that  we  employ  is  an  update  of  the 
tabulation of Sato et al. [1993] available at www.giss.nasa.gov/
data/strataer. The effective particle radius is ~0.2 μm when the 
optical  depth  is  small,  increasing  to  ~0.6  μm  after  the  largest 
volcanoes, as specified on the indicated website and also illus-
trated by Hansen et al. [2002]. Aerosols are assumed to have the 
optical properties of 75% sulfuric acid solution in H2O [Palmer 
and Williams, 1975].
The adjusted forcing by stratospheric aerosols in our mod-
 
el, for aerosols distributed over most of the globe, is [Efficacy, 
2005]

Fa (W/m2) ~ -25 τ , 

 

where τ is the optical thickness at λ = 0.55μm. Because the ef-
ficacy  of  stratospheric  aerosol  forcing  is  Ea  ~  91%  [Efficacy, 
2005], the effective forcing is

(1)

(2)

Fe (W/m2) ~ -23 τ . 

Satellite observations of the planetary radiation budget per-
 
turbation following the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption [Wong et 
al., 2004] provide a strong constraint on the aerosol forcing for 
that volcano [Figure 11 in Efficacy, 2005]. That comparison sug-
gests that the above relationship between aerosol optical thick-
ness and climate forcing is accurate within about 20%.
 
The stratospheric aerosol forcing becomes more uncertain 
toward earlier times. We estimate the uncertainty as increasing 
from ±20% for Pinatubo to ±50% for Krakatau. At intervals be-

HANSEN ET AL.: CLIMATE SIMULATIONS FOR 1880-2003 WITH GISS MODEL E

tween large eruptions prior to the satellite era, when small erup-
tions could have escaped detection, there was a minimum uncer-
tainty ~0.5 W/m2 in the aerosol forcing.
 
Stratospheric aerosol optical thickness was zero in our cli-
mate  model  control  run.  Our  future  control  runs  will  include 
stratospheric aerosols with τ (λ = 0.55μm) = 0.0125, the mean 
visible optical thickness for 1850-2000, with the rationale that 
this is a better estimate of the long-term mean stratospheric aero-
sol optical depth than is the use of zero aerosols. We recommend 
(Appendix A) that other researchers include such a mean aerosol 
amount  in  control  runs  used  as  spin-ups  for  transient  simula-
tions,  because  the  deep  ocean  then  approaches  a  more  appro-
priate  equilibrium  temperature.  Omission  of  this  forcing  from 
the control run alters the rate of ocean heat storage in transient 
climate  simulations.  Use  of  the  mean  aerosol  optical  depth  in 
the control run also would have reduced the modeled Krakatau 
cooling  by  almost  10%,  for  an  appropriate  reason,  bringing 
model and observations into better agreement (see section 4.2).
3.3.   Other Forcings

3.3.1. Land use. Changes of land use, especially deforesta-
tion that has occurred at middle latitudes and in the tropics, can 
cause a large regional climate forcing. Hansen et al. [1998a] and 
Betts  [2001]  independently  calculated  a  global  forcing  of  -0.2 
W/m2 for replacement of today’s land use pattern with natural 
vegetation. Much of the land use change occurred prior to 1880. 
In Efficacy [2005] the time-dependent land use data sets of Ra-
mankutty  and  Foley  [1999],  illustrated  by  Foley  et  al.  [2005], 
were found to yield a forcing Fe = -0.09 W/m2 for the 1880-1990 
change. This  forcing  may  not  fully  represent  land  use  effects, 
as there are other land use activities, such as irrigation, that are 
not included. We do not include the effect of biomass burning 
burn scars on surface albedo, which Myhre et al. [2005] show 
is  a  relatively  small  effect.  Myhre  and  Myhre  [2003]  estimate 
an  uncertainty  range  from  -0.6  to  +0.5 W/m2  for  the  land  use 
climate forcing, with positive forcings from irrigation and hu-
man plantings, but they conclude that the net land use forcing is 
probably negative.

We exclude land cover changes occurring as a feedback to 
climate change, except to the extent they are implicitly included 
in the Ramankutty and Foley [1999] data set. Such land cover

changes may have been moderate in the past century, but if the 
global  warming  trend  of  the  past  few  decades  continues  veg-
etation  feedbacks  in  the Arctic  may  be  substantial  [Chapin  et 
al., 2005]. This effect can be included in simulations via a dy-
namic vegetation treatment, but it is not included in our present 
model. 
Our  subjective  estimate  is  that  the  global  mean  land  use 
 
forcing for 1880-2000 lies between zero and -0.2 W/m2. How-
ever, the global value is less relevant than the regional forcing, 
which can be as much as several W/m2, as shown in Figure 7 
of Efficacy [2005]. The geographical pattern of the climate re-
sponse is shown in Figures 18-24 of Efficacy [2005] for a fixed 
forcing and below in section 5 for the transient 1880-2003 forc-
ing.
3.3.2.  Soot  effect  on  snow  and  ice  albedos.  Clarke  and 
 
Noone (1985), from measurements around the Arctic in the early 
1980s, showed that soot on snow and ice significantly reduced 
the  albedo  for  solar  radiation.  Hansen  and  Nazarenko  [2004] 
estimated that spectrally-integrated albedo changes of 1.5% in 
the Arctic and 3% in snow-covered Northern Hemisphere land 
regions  would  yield  a  global  climate  forcing  0.16  W/m2  and 
equilibrium  global  warming  0.24°C.  However,  Grenfell  et  al. 
[2002]  and  Sharma  et  al.  [2004]  found  smaller  soot  amounts 
in  more  recent  measurements,  perhaps  because  of  decreased 
emissions from North America, Europe and Russia, even though 
emissions from the Far East may have partially replaced those 
sources [Koch and Hansen, 2005].

Climate  forcing  by  soot  in  snow  is  inherently  difficult  to 
simulate  well,  because  the  albedo  change  depends  sensitively 
on the soot particle structure, how it is mixed in the snow [War-
ren and Wiscombe, 1985; Bohren, 1986], and how much soot is 
carried away in snowmelt as opposed to being retained near the 
snow or ice surface. In the current paper the snow albedo change 
is parameterized as proportional to local BC deposition with a 
scale factor yielding a conservative estimate of the soot effect, 
specifically a global forcing Fa ~ 0.05 W/m2 in 1990. However, 
Fe ~ 0.14 W/m2 in 1990, because of the high efficacy of snow 
albedo forcing [Efficacy, 2005; see also Appendix A.5 below].

The soot albedo effect is very uncertain because of the near 
absence  of  precise  albedo  measurements  and  soot  in  snow  in-
ventories  and  the  high  efficacy  of  even  a  small  snow  albedo 
change. Our subjective estimate is that the present soot albedo 
forcing is probably in the range Fa = 0-0.1 W/m2. In some of our 
simulations there was a programming error that caused this forc-
ing to have an incorrect geographical distribution (see Appendix 
A5). The error was corrected for ‘all forcings’ and snow albedo 
alone  ensembles,  but  not  for  simulations illustrated in  Figures 
18 and 22 because the effect was negligible for the comparisons 
illustrated in those figures.
3.3.3. Solar irradiance. The variations of total solar irra-
 
diance in our transient climate simulations submitted to IPCC, 
shown by the solid curve in Figure 4, are based on Lean [2000]. 
The  irradiance  changes  are  largest  at  ultraviolet  wavelengths. 
The resulting change of climate forcing for 1880-2003 (1880-
2000) is Fa = 0.24 W/m2 (0.30 W/m2), and Fe = 0.22 W/m2 (0.28 
W/m2)  based  on  the  linear  trend,  as  the  efficacy  of  the  solar 
forcing is Ea ~92% [Efficacy, 2005]. We do not include indirect 
effects  of  solar  irradiance  changes  on  O3  [Haigh,  1994;  Han-
sen et al., 1997b; Shindell et al., 1999; Tourpali et al., 2005], 
which may enhance the direct solar forcing, because the solar 
forcing itself is moderate in magnitude and uncertain. Shindell 
et  al.  [2001]  conclude  that  the  solar  indirect  radiative  forcing

via ozone is small, but there may be dynamical feedbacks that 
are significant for regional climate change [Shindell et al., 2001; 
Baldwin and Dunkerton, 2005; Tourpali et al., 2005].
Lean  et  al.  [2002]  call  into  question  the  long-term  solar 
 
irradiance  changes,  such  as  those  of  Lean  [2000],  which  have 
been used in many climate model studies including our present 
simulations.  The  basis  for  questioning  the  previously  inferred 
long-term  changes  is  the  realization  that  secular  increases  in 
cosmogenic  and  geomagnetic  proxies  of  solar  activity  do  not 
necessarily imply equivalent secular trends of solar irradiance. 
Thus, it is useful to compare the above solar irradiance forcing 
with a solar irradiance scenario that includes only the well-es-
tablished Schwabe ~11 year solar cycle, indicated by the dotted 
curve in Figure 5. In this alternative solar irradiance forcing his-
tory the 1880-2003 forcing based on the linear trend is Fa = 0.10 
W/m2 and Fe = 0.09 W/m2.
 
The fact that proxies of solar activity do not necessarily im-
ply long-term irradiance change does not mean that long-term 
solar irradiance change did not occur. Ample evidence for long-
term solar change and a link to climate has long been recognized 
[Eddy,  1976],  and  solar  models  admit  the  possibility  of  such 
change. Hoyt and Schatten [1993], on heuristic grounds, argue 
for solar change at least comparable to that of Lean [2000]; their 
inferred  solar  change  is  somewhat  greater  than  that  of  Lean 
[2000] and their secular increase of irradiance begins earlier in 
the 20th century. At least until precise measurements of irradi-
ance extend over several decades and more comprehensive solar 
models  are  available,  solar  climate  forcing  is  likely  to  remain 
highly uncertain.
3.4.   Summary of Global Forcings
Figure  5  and  Table  1  summarize  the  time  dependence  of 
 
the forcings that drive our simulated climate change. Effective 
forcings are shown in Figure 5, calculated as Fe = EaFa, when 
Fa is available, and as Fe = EsFs, when Fa is not available, as 
discussed in Efficacy [2005]. Use of Fe avoids exaggerating the 
importance  of  BC  and  O3  forcings  relative  to  the  well-mixed 
GHGs and reflective aerosols.
  Well-mixed GHGs provide the dominant forcing, which is 
Fa = 2.50 W/m2 and Fe = 2.72 W/m2 in 2003 relative to 1880. 
The total O3 forcing, including tropospheric increase and strato-
spheric depletion, is Fa = 0.28 W/m2 and Fe = 0.23 W/m2, as Ea 

for O3 is 82%. The CH4-derived H2O forcing is Fs ~ Fe = 0.06 
W/m2. Thus the total GHG forcing is Fe = 3.0 W/m2 in 2003, 
with CO2 providing about half of the total GHG forcing.
Aerosols, based on our estimates, yield a forcing Fe = –1.37 
 
W/m2 in 2003 relative to 1880. Thus the aerosol forcing in our 
estimate is about half of the GHG forcing, but of opposite sign. 
The aerosol indirect effect contributes more than half of the net 
aerosol forcing.
Other effective forcings are solar irradiance (+0.22 W/m2 in 
 
2003, a decrease from +0.28 W/m2 in 2000), snow albedo (+0.14 
W/m2), and land use (-0.09 W/m2).
The  sum  of  all  these  forcings  is  Fe  ~  Fs  ~  1.90  W/m2  in 
 
2003. However, it is more accurate to evaluate the net forcing 
from the ensemble of simulations carried out with all forcings 
present  at  the  same  time  [Efficacy,  2005],  thus  accounting  for 
any non-linearity in the combination of forcings and minimiz-
ing the effect of noise (unforced variability) in the climate mod-
el  runs. All  forcings  acting  together  yield  Fe  ~  1.75  W/m2  in 
2003.
 
The uncertainty in the net forcing is dominated by the un-
certainty  in  the  aerosol  forcing,  which  we  suggested  above  to 
be  at  least  50%.  Even  with  the  most  optimistic  assessment  of 
our  understanding  of  the  forcings,  we  must  conclude  that  the 
net forcing is uncertain by ~ 1 W/m2. Accepting these forcing 
estimates at face value implies that the net forcing is uncertain 
by about a factor of three, primarily because of the absence of 
accurate measurements of the aerosol direct and indirect forc-
ings.

4.  Alternative Data Samplings and the Krakatau Problem

 
Comparisons  of  simulated  climate  and  observations  com-
monly involve choices that affect how well the model and data 
appear  to  agree.  Choices  of  surface  temperature  data  deserve 
scrutiny,  because  surface  temperature  provides  the  usual  mea-
sure of long-term ‘global warming’ as well as a test of possible 
global cooling after large volcanic eruptions. We illustrate here 
alternative comparisons of model and observations, with model 
results being those of the coupled model (ocean C, the Russell et 
al. [1995] model) driven by all climate forcings of Figure 5. This 
model run is discussed in later sections.

Figure 6. Observed and modeled global surface temperature change for alternative ways of averaging over 
the globe, with the model driven by all forcings of Figure 5. (a) Observations are surface air temperature at 
meteorological stations averaged as defined by Hansen et al. [1999], model is true global mean. (b) Observed 
temperatures  are  surface  air  measurements  at  meteorological  stations  combined  with  SST  measurements 
over the ocean, model is true global mean. (c) Observations are at meteorological stations as in Figure 6a, 
model is sampled at the same places and times and analyzed in the same way as observations. (d) Model is 
true global mean, observations are based only on meteorological stations during 1880-1900, but incorporate 
SSTs after 1900.

4.1.   Century time-scale
 
Temperature measurements at meteorological stations pro-
vide a reasonably consistent data set for continental and island 
locations [Jones et al., 1986; Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987], albeit 
one  in  which  the  station  records  are  spatially  inhomogeneous, 
often  broken  temporally,  and  subject  to  non-climatic  effects. 
The  meteorological  station  records  that  we  employ  have  been 
adjusted for urban effects using neighboring rural stations [Han-
sen et al., 2001]. Such adjustments are imperfect, but the impact 
on global mean 100-year temperature change of uncertainties in 
urban adjustments is not larger than about 0.1°C [IPCC, 2001]. 
For the short interval after a volcano considered here, urban ad-
justments are negligible.
The  GISS  analysis  of  station  data  [Hansen  et  al.,  1981; 
 
Hansen  and  Lebedeff,  1987]  combines  stations  with  overlap-
ping  periods  of  record  so  as  to  preserve  information  on  tem-
poral  variability  while  allowing  individual  stations  to  affect 
estimated  temperature  change  at  distances  up  to  1200  km.  It 
has been shown, by sampling a global model with realistic tem-
perature variability at the station locations, that after about 1880 
the  station  network  is  capable  of  yielding  a  good  estimate  of 
global temperature change despite poor coverage in the South-
ern Hemisphere [Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987]. However, island 
and  coastal  stations  fail  to  sample  part  of  the  ocean,  and  both 

observations  and  models  indicate  that  the  long-term  tempera-
ture response tends to be less over the ocean than over continen-
tal  areas.  Thus  we  expect  the  long-term  “global”  temperature 
change estimated from the meteorological station network alone 
to slightly overestimate true global mean temperature change.
Improved  global  coverage  is  obtained  by  combining  me-
 
teorological  station  data  with  sea  surface  temperature  (SST) 
measurements of ocean areas [Jones et al., 1999; Hansen et al., 
2001]. However, ocean data have their own  problems, includ-
ing changes of measurement methods and infrequent sampling 
of  large  regions  [Parker  et  al.,  1994].  Sampling  is  especially 
poor in the 1800s, and spatial-temporal data-fill procedures risk 
smoothing real variations. In addition, the ocean area with the 
largest response to climate forcings in climate models, regions 
of sea ice, are practically unobserved.
 
Figure  6a  shows  an  estimate  of  global  temperature  using 
only meteorological station measurements [Hansen et al., 2001]. 
The observed 1880-2003 temperature change, based on the lin-
ear trend, is 0.69°C in this case. The model 5-run “all forcings” 
ensemble mean yields 0.56°C, with the model result being a true 
global mean.
 
Figure 6b uses the same land temperatures as in Figure 6a, 
but it adds SST data for the oceans, using ship data of Rayner et 
al. [2003] for 1880-1981 and subsequently satellite data [Reyn-
olds and Smith, 1994; Smith and Reynolds, 2004]. Inclusion of

ocean data reduces the observed global temperature change to 
0.59°C. It also practically eliminates evidence for cooling after 
the 1883 Krakatau eruption.
Figure  6c  is  a  third  alternative,  comparing  observed  tem-
 
perature from meteorological stations with the model sampled 
at the places and times of the observations. This sampled model 
data  is  run  through  the  same  temperature  analysis  program  as 
observations to produce the global mean. This third procedure is 
optimum in the sense of having the most consistent treatment of 
model and data, as well as preserving a best estimate for high fre-

quency temperature change in the period of sparse observations 
in the 1800s. The model sampled at observing stations yields a 
global  warming  of  0.59°C  based  on  the  linear  trend,  which  is 
less than the observed 0.69°C. This discrepancy occurs because 
the model warms less over land areas than observed, a result that 
we identify with excessive anthropogenic tropospheric aerosols 
over Eurasia in our standard “all forcings”, as discussed in sec-
tion  5.  This  third  procedure  provides  a  clean  comparison  of 
model and observations, but the integration over the globe is not 
a true global mean. In addition, it is unlikely that most modelers

Figure 8. Global mean climate change of GISS model III version of modelE atmosphere coupled to Russell 
ocean model and driven by the climate forcings of Figure 5. Left column shows temperature change at three 
levels using vertical weighting functions of the MSU satellite instrument [Mears et al., 2003; see also www.
ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html]. Observed surface temperature, in the upper right, uses meteo-
rological station data over land and SSTs over the ocean as in part (b) of Figure 6. “Observed” ocean ice 
cover is the analysis of Rayner et al. [2003]. A small radiation imbalance in the control run is subtracted from 
planetary net radiation.

will sample their model results at the times and places of meteo-
rological station measurements and run the results through the 
GISS temperature analysis program, thus making it difficult to 
compare GISS model results with other models.
 
Figure 6d is a fourth alternative, comparing model results 
for the true global mean with observations that use only meteo-
rological  stations  for  1880-1900  but  add  ocean  data  for  1900-
2003, when ship data had better coverage. This alternative pre-
serves temperature variations in the 1800s without exaggerating 

long-term global temperature change. The observed 1880-2003 
temperature change in this case, 0.61°C, is slightly larger than 
in Figure 6b, as expected due to the cooling in the 1880s. The 
disadvantage of this fourth alternative is the arbitrariness inher-
ent in concatenating two data sets.
  We present all four alternatives to help readers make their 
own assessment. For simplicity we use the procedure of Figure 
6b in following sections, i.e., we use the true global mean for 
the model and the land + ocean data for observations. However,

it should be born in mind that these observations probably miss 
some actual cooling after Krakatau.
  We examine the Krakatau period in more detail, because it 
has an effect on how well the model and observations appear to 
agree over the 120-year temperature record. We find it useful to 
compare  the  1883  Krakatau  and  1991  Pinatubo  eruptions,  the 
two  largest  volcanic  aerosol  climate  forcings  in  the  period  of 
instrumental  climate  data  [Sato  et  al.,  1993]. These  volcanoes 
have  the  best  chance  of  producing  signals  above  the  climate 
noise level and the Pinatubo period has extensive climate obser-
vations.
4.2.   Temperature change after Krakatau and Pinatubo
Estimated aerosol optical depths after Krakatau and Pintubo 
 
are shown in Figure 7a. The shape of the Krakatau curve is as-
sumed  to  be  similar  to  that  after  Pinatubo,  as  they  were  both 
low latitude injections to high altitudes at similar times of year. 
Measurements  of  decreased  solar  irradiance  integrated  over 
three years after Krakatau were used to set the aerosol optical 
depth [Sato et al., 1993]. Effective forcings are shown in Figure 
7b. Resulting temperature anomalies, relative to the three-year 
mean preceding the eruption, are shown in Figure 7c. The simu-
lated cooling after Krakatau exceeds that after Pinatubo by more 
than  the  assumed  10%  difference  in  their  forcings.  This  must 
be at least in part because of planetary radiation imbalance of 
about +0.5 W/m2 that existed just prior to the Pinatubo eruption 
[Hansen et al., 1993] but not at the time of the Krakatau erup-
tion. Further, as mentioned in section 3.2.1, the response to the 
Krakatau  aerosols  would  have  been  reduced  about  10  percent 
if the control run ocean temperatures had included the effect of 
prior volcanic eruptions via a mean stratospheric aerosol optical 
depth.
 
Figure 7c shows that the global mean temperature based on 
meteorological station data after Krakatau is consistent with the 
climate simulations. The seasonal mean 1σ error bar for global 
temperature estimated from the meteorological station network 
in the 1880s is 0.15°C [Hansen and Lebedeff, 1987]. Thus the 
cooling observed by the station network after Krakatau for a giv-

en season could be a sampling error, but not the nearly continu-
ous cool period for several years after the eruption. Furthermore, 
comparison of the global temperature curve estimated from me-
teorological stations in the Pinatubo era (right side of Figure 7c) 
with the global temperature curve that has complete ocean cov-
erage from satellite data shows that the station network tracks 
the complete global data within the expected error for the station 
network (1σ sampling error being 0.09°C for the station distri-
bution in the 1990s). We conclude that there was global cooling 
after Krakatau.
 
Figure 7d shows the observed and simulated surface tem-
perature anomalies in the northern winter (DJF) following the 
eruptions and the northern summer (JJA) about one year after 
the  eruptions. As  expected,  the  model  and  observations  show 
strong cooling in the summer after the eruption, especially over 
the  continents.  Also  the  model  and  observations  show  global 
cooling  in  DJF,  with  evidence  for  regional  Eurasian  “winter 
warming”,  an  expected  dynamical  response  [Groisman,  1992; 
Perlwitz and Graf, 1995; Robock, 2000; Shindell et al., 2001], 
which  has  previously  been  reported  to  occur  in  current  GISS 
models  [Shindell  et  al.,  2004].  The  model,  using  the  coarse-
resolution Russell et al. [1995] ocean, is not able to produce El 
Ninos, which have accompanied several large volcanoes in the 
past century [Handler, 1984; Robock, 2000; Mann et al., 2005] 
and  may  be  responsible  for  warming  in  the  region  of Alaska. 
Temperature anomalies are muted in the 5-run model mean in 
Figure 7d, but the magnitude of anomalies is more realistic in 
the individual runs, which are available on the GISS web-site.

5.  Climate Response in Historical Period

Climate model responses to the above forcing mechanisms 
 
have been reported in the literature. Nevertheless, side-by-side 
comparison of responses to each forcing by a single model with 
documented sensitivity has merit and aids interpretation of the 
model  and  real  world  response  to  all  forcings  acting  at  once. 
Section 5.1 sets the context by showing the response of global 
mean  temperature,  planetary  radiation  balance,  and  ocean  ice

cover to all forcings acting at once, and examining the contribu-
tion of each forcing to global mean surface temperature change. 
Section  5.2  illustrates  the  spatial  and  seasonal  distribution  of 
the temperature response to all forcings and individual forcings. 
Section  5.3  examines  the  effect  of  all  forcings  and  individual 
forcings on several other climate variables.
5.1. Global Mean Temperature Response versus Time
5.1.1.  Coupled  model  response  to  all  forcings.  The  left 
 
side of Figure 8 compares satellite microwave temperature ob-
servations at three atmospheric levels with the coupled climate 
model response to “all forcings” of Figure 5. Satellite results in 
Figure 8 are from near-nadir observations as analyzed by Mears 
et  al.  [2003;  see  also  www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_descrip-
tion.html],  but  we  compare  model  results  with  both  Mears  et 
al. and Christy et al. analyses in Table 2. Although successive 
versions of the Christy et al. [2000] tropospheric analysis have 
moved  from  a  cooling  trend  to  significant  warming,  a  recent 
version  (5.1)  of  their  analysis  [vortex.nsstc.uah.edu/data.msu] 
has less warming than that in the analysis of Mears et al.[2003] 
(Table  2).  Recent  assessment  of  several  data  sets  [Karl  et  al., 
2006] concludes that the warming trends of Mears et al [2003] 
are more realistic than those in the pioneering analysis of Chris-
ty et al. [2000].
Figure 8 includes the microwave lower stratosphere (LS), 
 
troposphere/stratosphere  (T/S),  and  middle  troposphere  (MT) 
analyses  (described  as  MSU4,  MSU3  and  MSU2  in  prior  pa-
pers), which are based on near-nadir observations. Use of near-
nadir  observations  yields  broad  weighting  functions,  i.e.,  the 
derived  temperatures  refer  to  thick  atmospheric  layers,  but  it 
avoids increased errors and uncertainty that arises in combining 
multiple slant-angle data to obtain sharper weighting functions. 
The LS, T/S and MT levels have weighting functions that peak 
at altitudes ~15-20 km, ~10 km and ~5 km, respectively [Figure 
2 on Mears et al. web site given above]. Note that ~15% of the 
MT signal comes from the stratosphere, despite its description 
as “middle troposphere”.
 
The simulated global LS warming following the 1991 Mt. 
Pinatubo eruption agrees closely with observations, which is an 
improvement  over  the  model  results  of  Hansen  et  al.  [2002]. 
The  improved  response  came  when  the  model  top  was  raised 
from  10  hPa  to  0.1  hPa  with  higher  vertical  resolution  in  the 
stratosphere. The simulated 25-year (1979-2003) trend of global 
LS temperature (-0.31 °C/decade) agrees well with the Mears et 
al. data (-0.32°C/decade), but not as well with the Christy et al. 
analysis (-0.45°C/decade), as summarized in Table 2.
The  simulated  25-year  MT  temperature  trend  (Figure  8, 
 
Table  2)  with  all  forcings  is  +0.14°C/decade  (+0.15°C/decade 
for each of the altered aerosol and solar irradiance histories dis-
cussed  in  section  5.4),  which  is  also  in  good  agreement  with 
the observational analysis of Mears et al. (+0.13°C/decade) but 
not with the +0.05°C/decade of Christy et al. Observations have 
greater interannual variability than the model, which is expected 
as our present coupled model has only slight El Nino-like tropi-
cal variability and has unrealistically few sudden stratospheric 
warmings  (section  2.1).  The  large  observed  tropospheric  fluc-
tuation  in  1998,  for  example,  is  associated  with  an  unusually 
strong El Nino.
 
The  simulated  T/S  temperature  trend  (+0.10°C/decade)  is 
greater  than  in  the  analysis  of  Mears  et  al.  (0.03°C/decade). 
Temperature change at this atmospheric level is very sensitive 
to  surface  temperature.  If  we  replace  the  coupled  model  SST 

with observed SST (ocean A), the discrepancy with the satellite 
observation largely disappears (Table 2), indeed ocean A yields 
no warming at that level. As discussed in section 5.3.3, tropical 
SST variability causes a large variability at the T/S level.
 
A sharper lower tropospheric (LT) weighting function can 
be obtained from linear combination of multiple slant angle mi-
crowave  observations. Analyses  of  such  LT  trends  by  Christy 
et  al.  [2000]  led  to  the  claim  that  the  lower  troposphere  was 
cooling or at least warming much less than surface temperature 
trends reported by Jones et al. [1999] and Hansen et al. [2001]. 
Fu and Johanson [2005] use linear combinations of near-nadir 
observations  as  an  alternative  approach  to  obtain  tropopsheric 
temperature trends, thus showing that the LT temperature trend 
of Christy et al. [2000] is inconsistent with the near-nadir (MT 
and LS) data of Christy et al. [2000]. A recent derivation of LT 
temperature  trends  by  Mears  and  Wentz.  [2005],  with  an  im-
proved  diurnal  variation  of  instrumental  calibration,  yields  an 
LT  temperature  trend  (+0.19°C/decade)  that  is  consistent  with 
our  climate  simulations  (+0.18°C  for  standard  forcings  and 
+0.20°C/decade for the alternative forcings). The recent Christy 
et al. LT trend, from version 5.1 on their web site in September 
2005, with their own improved diurnal correction, is +0.12°C/
decade, which is larger than their previous results but less than 
our model using known forcings and less than the Mears et al. 
analysis of observations (Table 2).
  We note that our LS, T/S, MT and LT temperature trends are 
all obtained using simple vertical weighting functions [Hansen 
et al., 1998b]. Resulting global temperature trends for LS, T/S 
and MT differ little from those obtained with elaborate radiative 
transfer calculations that include refraction of  the  microwaves 
and  variable  surface  emissivity  [Shah  and  Rind,  1998].  How-
ever, our calculated LT temperature trend will not account for 
changes  in  atmospheric  water  vapor  and  surface  emissivity, 
which  are  substantial  for  the  (slant  angle)  LT  data.  Thus  our 
modeled  LT  change,  although  a  good  measure  of  the  model’s 
lower tropospheric temperature change, may not be accurately 
comparable to the satellite-derived LT ‘temperature’ trends. For 
this reason, we emphasize LS and MT data, and, to lesser degree 
the shorter record of T/S data.
 
The  simulated  1880-2003  global  surface  temperature 
change  (upper  right  of  Figure  8),  agrees  reasonably  well  with 
observations, although the 124-year warming based on the lin-
ear trend is slightly (~0.1°C) less than observed (Table 2). Two 
noticeable discrepancies with the temporal variation of observed 
global surface temperature are the absence of strong cooling fol-
lowing the 1883 Krakatau eruption and the lack of a warm peak 
at about 1940. We suggested above (section 4.2) that the near-
absence of observed cooling after Krakatau may be, at least in 
part, a problem with the ocean data.
 
The model’s fit with peak warmth near 1940 depends in part 
on unforced fluctuations, e.g., the runs of Hansen et al. [2005b], 
with nearly identical forcings to those in this paper [see appen-
dix A], appear to agree better with observations. As expected, 
the runs in which the solar forcing includes only the Schwabe 
11-year solar cycle [Figure 4], available on the GISS web-site 
and included in Table 2 as AltSol, do not produce peak warmth 
near  1940. AltSol  also  differs  from  the  standard  “all  forcing” 
scenario  in  having  the  sulfate  forcing  reduced  by  50%,  thus 
yielding an 1880-2003 global warming of 0.64°C.
It may be fruitless to search for an external forcing to pro-
 
duce peak warmth around 1940. It is shown below that the ob-
served  maximum  is  due  almost  entirely  to  temporary  warmth

in the Arctic. Such Arctic warmth could be a natural oscillation 
[Johannessen et al., 2004], possibly unforced. Indeed, there are 
few  forcings  that  would  yield  warmth  largely  confined  to  the 
Arctic. Candidates might be soot blown to the Arctic from in-
dustrial activity at the outset of World War II, or solar forcing 
of the Arctic Oscillation [Shindell et al., 1999; Tourpali et al., 
2005] that is not captured by our present model. Perhaps a more 
likely scenario is an unforced ocean dynamical fluctuation with 
heat transport to the Arctic and positive feedbacks from reduced 
sea ice.
Figure  8  also  illustrates  the  planetary  energy  imbalance, 
 
which has grown in recent decades because of the rapid increase 
of the net climate forcing (Fig. 5) and the ocean’s thermal iner-
tia.  The  simulated  imbalance  averaged  about  0.7  W/m2  in  the 
past decade. As discussed in Appendix A, our present simulated 
energy imbalance for the past decade is ~0.02 W/m2 less than 
found  by  Hansen  et  al.  [2005b],  because  the  stratospheric  O3 
depletion in the latter paper inadvertently was only 5/9 as large 
as that estimated by Randel and Wu [1999].
The  simulated  decrease  of  ocean  ice  cover  over  the  past 
 
century, from about 4.25% of the Earth’s surface area to about 
4%, is only about half as large as suggested by analysis of ob-
servations [Rayner et al., 2003]. Although sea ice observations 
contain  substantial  uncertainty,  we  note  that  sea  ice  is  more 
stable in the present model than in previous GISS models. The 
increased stability of sea ice apparently accounts for the slightly 
lower sensitivity, 2.7-2.9°C for doubled CO2, of modelE com-
pared  with  ~3°C  for  doubled  CO2  with  the  prior  GISS  model 
[Hansen et al., 2002].
5.1.2. Effect of alternative oceans. Figure 9 and Table 3 
 
show global mean simulations for the same climate forcings as 
in Figure 8, but with alternative oceans. Figure 9a is for ocean A, 
i.e., specified SST and sea ice that follow the history of Rayner 
et  al.  [2003].  Figure  9b  is  for  ocean  B,  i.e.,  the  Q-flux  ocean 
[Hansen et al., 1984; Russell et al., 1985], with specified hori-
zontal ocean heat transports inferred from the ocean A control 
run and diffusive uptake of heat anomalies by the deep ocean.
Stratospheric temperature change is similar for ocean A and 
 
ocean C, but there is greater year to year variability with ocean 
A because, unlike the coarse-resolution Russell ocean, the ob-
served  SSTs  and  sea  ice  capture  tropospheric  variability  such 
as that due to El Ninos, which in turn affects stratospheric tem-
perature. The resulting net radiation at the top of the atmosphere 
also has greater year-to-year variability with ocean A, and there 
is an off-set by a few tenths of 1 W/m2 with ocean A, reflecting 
the fact that the ocean A model with 1880 forcings was out of 
radiation balance by that amount.
 

The simulated 1880-2003 global surface temperature change 

is larger for ocean A than observed, even though ocean A is driv-
en by the SSTs used to compute observed global temperature. 
We investigate this discrepancy in Appendix A and discover that 
it seems to be due mainly to calculation of surface air tempera-
ture change over the ocean at an altitude of 10 m in model E. 
This difference can be reduced by using the temperature of the 
first ocean layer as the “surface” temperature, but that approach 
has not been the practice in prior climate studies (Appendix A).
Global mean changes obtained with the Q-flux ocean (Fig-
 
ure  9b)  driven  [Figure  1]by  all  the  climate  forcings  are  very 
similar  to  those  in  the  coupled  dynamical  ocean  model  (Fig-
ure 8). The change in sea ice cover is again much less than the 
Rayner et al. [2003] analysis of observations suggests. The sea 
ice model, calculated on the atmospheric grid, is the same for all 
ocean representations [modelE, 2006]. Lack of sufficient sea ice 
response may be related to the under-prediction of seasonal sea 
ice change in the modelE control runs, a matter that is presently 
being investigated.
5.1.3.  Response  to  individual  forcings.  Figure  10  shows 
 
the global surface temperature response to individual forcings, 
as well as the response to all forcings acting at once. There are 
nine individual forcings, as opposed to the 10 in Figure 5a, be-
cause  the  reflecting  and  absorbing  (BC)  aerosols  are  included 
together in the tropospheric aerosol runs. Five 1880-2003 runs 
were made for each forcing, with the runs started from control 
run conditions at intervals of 25 years. The control run was near 
radiative equilibrium, within ~0.2 W/m2 at the points of experi-
ment initiation, so model drift was small. The effect of model 
drift was reduced by subtracting the change of each diagnostic 
quantity for the corresponding year of the control run. Discus-
sion of alternative control run procedures is included in Appen-
dix A.
The response to well-mixed greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing 
 
is a global warming of ~1.0°C over the period 1880-2003. There 
is a slow warming of 0.25°C over the first 75 years, and then a 
rapid approximately linear warming of 0.75°C. The change in 
the warming rate reflects the jump of GHG growth rates between 
1950 and 1975 driven about equally by Montreal Protocol Trace 
Gases (MPTGs) and an increase of the CO2 growth rate [Figure 
4  of  Hansen  and  Sato,  2004]. A  decline  in  the  growth  rate  of 
the GHG forcing occurred near 1990 due to halt in growth of 
MPTGs and slowdown of CH4 growth [ibid.; see also Figure 1 
above], and this is reflected in the simulated global response to 
the well-mixed GHG forcing.
 
Stratospheric (volcanic) aerosols, despite their brief lifetime 
(e-folding decay time ~ 1 year), have a multi-decadal effect on 
simulated temperature because of clustering of volcanoes near 
the  beginning  of  the  1880-2003  period  and  from  1963-1991.

Figure 10. Simulated global temperature response to all climate forcings of Figure 5 operating at once, and 
the response to individual forcings. Five runs for each forcing were initiated at 25-year or 30-year intervals 
of the control run. Small model drift was removed by subtracting the control run year-by-year. Response to 
the aerosol indirect forcing is obtained as the difference between runs with direct and indirect forcings and 
runs with only the direct aerosol forcing. Climate model is the model III version of GISS modelE with the 
Russell ocean model.

Thus volcanoes contribute to the perceived mid-century global 
warming peak.
The global coolings due to aerosol direct and indirect forc-
 
ings are consistent with the temporal variation of their forcings 
(Figure 5). Their combined global cooling reaches ~0.55°C by 
2003.
Ozone and solar irradiance changes cause global warming 
 
+0.08 and +0.07°C, respectively, over the 124-year period. Land 
use change causes a cooling –0.05°C.
 
Global mean surface temperature responses to the forcings 
by  CH4-derived  stratospheric  H2O  and  the  soot  snow  albedo 
effect  are  small,  consistent  with  the  small  forcings. The  small 

forcing  for  CH4-derived  H2O  occurs  because,  at  least  in  our 
model, the large increase of middle stratospheric H2O caused by 
increasing CH4 does not extend down to the tropopause region, 
where it would be effective in altering surface temperature. The 
soot snow albedo forcing is small by assumption in the absence 
of adequate measurements (section 3.3.2).
Observed  global  warming,  as  well  as  the  global  warming 
 
in the model driven by all forcings, has been nearly constant at 
about 0.15°C/decade over the past 3-4 decades, except for tem-
porary interruptions by large volcanoes. This high warming rate 
is maintained in the most recent decade despite a slowdown in 
the growth rate of climate forcing by well-mixed GHGs [Figure

al. [2003] over the ocean.

1 above and Figure 4 of Hansen and Sato, 2004]. The warming 
rate in the model is maintained because, by assumption, tropo-
spheric aerosols stop increasing in 1990. Prior to 1990 increas-
ing aerosols partially counterbalanced the large growth rate of 
positive forcing by GHGs.
 
The assumption that global aerosol amount approximately 
leveled  off  after  1990  is  uncertain,  because  adequate  aerosol 
observations are not available. However, there is evidence that 
aerosol amount declined after 1980 in United States and Europe 
[Schwikowski et al., 1999;  Preunkert et al., 2001;  Liepert and 
Tegen, 2002], consistent with a leveling off or decline in ‘global 
dimming’ [Wild et al., 2005]. Aerosol emissions probably con-
tinued  to  increase  in  developing  countries  such  as  China  and 
India [Bond et al., 2004]. An implicit conclusion is that future 
global  warming  may  depend  substantially  on  how  the  global 
aerosol  amount  continues  to  evolve  [Andreae  et  al.,  2005],  as 
well as on the GHG growth rate.
5.2. Spatial and Seasonal Temperature Change
5.2.1. Global maps of surface temperature change. Figure 
 
11  shows  observed  and  simulated  surface  temperature  change 
for the full period 1880-2003 and four subperiods. The period 
since 1950 is frequently studied because of more complete ob-
servations in the second half of the century. Breakdown into the 
segments  1880-1940,  1940-1979  and  1979-2003  captures  the 
period of observed cooling after 1940, and the era of extensive 
satellite observations beginning in 1979. The maps show the lo-
cal temperature change based on the linear trend. Thus the glob-
al mean temperature change, shown on the upper right corner of 
each map, often differs from the change in Table 1, which gives 
the difference of the 5-year running mean at the start and end of 
the indicated time interval. The linear trend yields a less noisy 
map. We provide both global mean results for a more complete 
description.
 
The lowest row in Figure 11 shows the standard deviation 
(σ) in the control run, specifically σ for the temperature change 
in all periods of the control run of length 124, 54, 61, 40 and 25 
years in the second half of the 2000-year control run, by which 
time the control run was near equilibrium, e.g., within 0.1 W/m2 
of radiation balance with space. Nominally, if the absolute value 
of the change simulated for a given climate forcing (the mean 
change for a 5-member ensemble of runs) exceeds σ, the change 
is significant at about the 95% level. Note that σ decreases ap-
proximately as the inverse square root of the period, consistent 
with expected uncertainty in estimating a trend imbedded in ran-
dom noise. 
The well-mixed GHGs by themselves cause a global mean 
 
warming of ~1°C, about 50% larger than observed warming, as 
shown also by the line graphs (Figure 10). Surface temperature 
response  to  GHGs  varies  a  lot  spatially. Almost  all  land  areas 
warm more than 1°C while most ocean areas warm between 0.5 
and 1°C. However, the Arctic warms more than 2°C, while the 
circum-Antarctic ocean warms only about 0.2°C. Large Arctic 
warming is an expected result of the positive ice/snow albedo 
feedback. The small response of the circum-Antarctic ocean sur-
face is mainly a result of the inertia due to deep ocean mixing in 
that region [Manabe et al., 1991], although deficient sea ice in 
the control run may contribute. A larger response is obtained in 
that region in the Efficacy [2005] experiments in which the full 
1880-2000 forcing is maintained for 120 years. Cooling or mini-
mal warming in the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean 
near the dateline is also obtained in many other coupled models 

[Kim et al., 2005].
 
All forcings together yield a global mean warming ~0.1°C 
less than observed for the full period 1880-2003. The primary 
location of deficient warming is in Europe and in Eurasia down-
wind  of  Europe.  Indeed,  Figure  11  shows  that  the  model  pro-
duces cooling over Europe, where observations show substan-
tial  warming.  Figure  11  also  indicates  that  this  regional  cool-
ing is due to aerosols, for which the direct effect over Europe 
is  about  –1°C  and  the  indirect  effect  about  –0.5°C.  Land  use 
change  contributes  a  cooling  of  about  –0.5°C,  but  in  a  region 
largely  confined  to  the  area  of  assumed  large  20th  century  ag-
ricultural  development  (see  also  Figures  7  and  18  in  Efficacy 
[2005]). Independent comparison of our aerosol optical depths 
with AERONET data [Holben et al., 2001; Dubovik et al., 2002] 
indicate an excessive aerosol amount in Europe and downwind, 
as discussed in section 5.4, where we carry out sensitivity ex-
periments  with  aerosol  amounts  altered  to  be  more  consistent 
with  regional AERONET  data.  Note  in  Figure  11  that  a  large 
fraction of observed European warming occurred during 1979-
2003, when some observations suggest that aerosols had begun 
to decline in Europe [Schwikowski et al., 1999; Preunkert et al., 
2001; Liepert and Tegen, 2002]. Our simulations had little aero-
sol change over Europe in 1979-1990 and no change after 1990, 
except for nitrates, which increased in proportion to global pop-
ulation (section 3.2.1). 
5.2.2.  Zonal  mean  surface  temperature  change  versus 
 
time. Figure 12 shows the zonal mean surface air temperature 
versus time relative to the base period 1901-1930. The early base 
period allows the total temperature change at adjacent latitudes 
to be compared readily. The period prior to 1900 is not suitable 
for a base period because of limited spatial coverage of observa-
tions.
The  upper  two  panels  on  the  left  side  of  Figure  12  com-
 
pare  observations  from  only  meteorological  stations  and  the 
combined station plus SST observations, in both cases using the 
data as analyzed by Hansen et al. [2001]. Use of SSTs slight-
ly  reduces  the  analyzed  temperature  change  over  the  century. 
Damping of the temperature change is consistent with the longer 
response  time  of  the  ocean,  but  also  could  be  a  consequence 
of the larger unforced variability of temperature over land. The 
difference  in  the  two  observational  analyses  in  the  Antarctic 
region is a consequence of using temperatures anomalies from 
the nearest latitudes with observations to define the (1901-1930) 
base  period  values  for  the Antarctic  region. The  early  century 
anomalies  closest  to Antarctica  are  rather  different  in  the  two 
data sets, the meteorological stations showing a warming over 
the 1900-present period, while the ocean data set has negligible 
change.  Observations  are  too  meager  to  say  which  data  set  is 
more accurate.
 
Surface  air  temperature  in  the  model  with  observed  time-
varying SST and all forcings is shown in the third panel of Fig-
ure 12. The fourth panel has observed time-varying SST, SI and 
forcings. Changing sea ice has a noticeable effect at high lati-
tudes because of the large difference between surface air tem-
perature  and  ocean  temperature  that  can  exist  in  the  presence 
of a sea ice layer. An additional ensemble of runs driven only 
by changing SST and SI, with radiative forcings fixed at 1880 
values, was run and is available on the GISS web site. The cor-
responding diagram appears very similar to the fourth diagram 
in Figure 12, as forcings have little effect on surface air tempera-
ture if the ocean and sea ice are specified.

yield  similar  zonal  mean  surface  temperature  responses  to  all 
forcings. As expected, neither model captures substantial ENSO 
variability. Simulated 1880-2003 warming is slightly larger than 
observed in the tropics, but smaller than observed at Northern 
Hemisphere  middle  and  high  latitudes.  Cooling  due  to  volca-
noes,  e.g.,  after  1963  (Agung),  1982  (El  Chichon),  and  1991 
(Pinatubo),  is  greater  than  observed,  although  the  discrepancy 
is exaggerated in these plots by the deficient long-term warm-
ing trend at northern latitudes. Note that the Q-flux model has 
greater warming in the Southern Ocean, where deep mixing in 
the dynamical Russell ocean limits the surface warming.
The bottom two panels on the left side of Figure 12 show 
 
the unforced variability in the control run, for a single 124-year 
period and for the mean of five 124-year periods. The latter mean 
is the model’s noise level for a 5-member ensemble mean, which 
is an appropriate measure of significance of features in the en-
semble responses to forcings shown in other parts of the figure. 
However, the real world made only a single “run” through the 

1880-2003  period,  so  the  noise  level  in  a  single  period  of  the 
control run is also a useful measure. As expected, the unforced 
variability in a single run is about twice as large as in the en-
semble mean.
The well-mixed GHGs and tropospheric aerosols yield re-
 
sponses  far  larger  than  unforced  variability,  the  signals  being 
larger in the Northern Hemisphere, especially for aerosols. The 
multi-decadal response to stratospheric aerosols is apparent, as 
well  as  shorter-term  responses.  Forcings  with  a  global  magni-
tude  of  a  few  tenths  of  a W/m2,  such  as  ozone  and  solar  irra-
diance, yield noticeable responses, with the response to ozone 
being mainly in the Northern Hemisphere and the response to 
solar  forcing  mainly  in  the  tropics. The  weak  global  forcings, 
i.e., land use and snow albedo, yield weak responses with ex-
pected signs.

(1880-1940,  1940-1979,  1979-2003).  The  bottom  row  is  two 
times the standard deviation (σ) of temperature change among 
periods of relevant length (125, 61, 40, and 25 years). Because 
experiment results for each forcing are a 5-run mean, simulated 
temperature changes exceeding 2σ are statistically significant at 
>99%.
  Well-mixed  GHGs  are  a  dominant  cause  of  both  tropo-
spheric warming and stratospheric cooling. Some forcings that 
yield a weak response at the surface, specifically ozone change 
and CH4-derived water vapor, yield responses much larger than 
unforced variability at higher atmospheric levels. The assumed 
solar  irradiance  increase  yields  significant  warming  in  the  up-
per atmosphere due to the large irradiance change at ultraviolet 
wavelengths [Lean et al., 2002] that are absorbed at high lev-
els.
Note  that  substantial  temperature  changes  in  the  tropo-
 
sphere  are  often  accompanied  by  temperature  changes  of  the 
opposite sign in the stratosphere. A primary mechanism for the 
stratospheric temperature change is the change in stratospheric 
water vapor, as illustrated for many forcing mechanisms in Fig-
ure 20 of Efficacy [2005]. Generally the forcings that warm the 
troposphere inject more water vapor into the stratosphere, which 
allows the (optically thin) stratosphere to cool more effectively. 
Of course, those forcings that alter a direct source of stratospher-
ic  heating,  such  as  volcanic  aerosols,  stratospheric  ozone,  and 
solar irradiance, can override this stratospheric effect of the tro-
pospheric climate change. In addition, as the infrared opacity of 
the atmosphere increases (decreases) the radiative lapse rate in-
creases (decreases), thus tending to increase (decrease) the tem-
perature at levels below (above) the mean level of radiation to 
space. The mean level of emission to space is at altitude about 6 
km, but tropospheric convection tends to spread the temperature 
anomaly of the lower troposphere throughout the troposphere. 
Thus there is a tendency for temperature changes to be of op-
posite sign in the troposphere and stratosphere, for forcings that 
do not provide a direct heating source within the stratosphere.
Figure 13b shows the zonal mean surface and lower strato-
 
sphere  (MSU  LS  channel)  temperature  changes  as  a  function 
of  month  and  latitude.  Stratospheric  cooling,  with  maximum 
at the poles, is caused by well-mixed GHGs (mainly CO2), O3 
and H2O. The surface temperature change is dominated by the 
warming effect of well-mixed GHGs, which is partly balanced 
by the cooling effect of tropospheric aerosols. The net effect of 
all forcings is compared with observations in the next subsec-
tion.
5.2.4.  Comparisons  with  observations.  Figure  14  com-
 
pares  observed  temperature  change  to  simulations  using  the 
coupled  model  driven  by  all  forcings  of  Figure  5.  Figure  14a 
is the latitude-altitude change of zonal-mean atmospheric tem-
perature for several periods with readily available observational 
data: 1958-1998, 1979-1998, and 1987-2003. For the first two 
periods the data are as graphed by Hansen et al. [2002] using 
radiosonde analyses of Parker et al. [1997]. For the third period 
the observational data are for four levels: surface data from the 
analysis of Hansen et al. [2001] and satellite MT, T/S and LS 
levels from the analysis of Mears et al. [2003; see also www.
ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html].
 
The  main  difference  between  simulations  and  radiosonde 
data is that the switchover from warming to cooling occurs at a 
lower altitude in the radiosonde data and stratospheric cooling is 
greater. This difference is of the nature identified by Sherwood 
et al. [2005] as spurious cooling in the radiosonde data that in-

creases with altitude, which can at least partly account for the 
discrepancy. Agreement is better in the period 1987-2003, which 
employs satellite and surface data, but the model has 0.1-0.2°C 
too much tropical upper tropospheric warming, consistent with 
the excessive warming at the surface in the tropics (Figures 11 
and  12).  Near  the  North  Pole  observed  warming  exceeds  that 
modeled,  but  the  discrepancy  there  is  less  than  the  unforced 
variability at those latitudes (bottom row of Figure 13b). In spite 
of these differences, it seems clear that, in both model and ob-
servations, there has been slight cooling at the tropopause level 
(defined in Figure 3 of Efficacy [2005]) in recent decades, as has 
been discussed [Zhou et al., 2001; Efficacy, 2005] because of its 
relevance to stratospheric water vapor trends.
 
Tropopause height must change in response to tropospheric 
warming and cooling near and above the tropopause. Figure 14a 
shows that the level of zero temperature change occurs beneath 
the tropopause and the degree of cooling increases with altitude 
at the tropopause level in observations and model. This implies 
that the tropopause height increased over these periods. Santer 
et al. [2003, 2005a,b] examined temperature profile and tropo-
pause  height  changes  in  climate  models  and  reanalysis  data, 
showing that the tropopause height provides a useful verification 
that the atmosphere is responding as expected to climate forc-
ings. Figure 13a shows that several forcing mechanisms contrib-
ute to tropospheric warming with temperature change decreas-
ing with altitude at the tropopause: well-mixed GHGs, O3, and 
CH4-derived H2O, while tropospheric aerosols and stratospheric 
aerosols have an opposite response that would tend to decrease 
tropopause  height,  although  the  response  in  polar  regions  is 
more complex.
 
Figure  14b  shows  simulated  tropopause  height  change 
in  our  coupled  model  versus  time  for  1880-2003.  We  use  the 
World Meteorological Organization definition of the tropopause 
[WMO, 1957; Reichler et al., 1996], as illustrated for the GISS 
model in Figure 3 of Efficacy [2005]. The simulated 1880-2003 
tropopause pressure change is about -3.5 hPa, corresponding to 
a  tropopause  height  increase  of  about  150  m.  Consistent  with 
findings of Santer et al. [2003], well-mixed GHGs and O3 are 
the  main  contributors  to  increasing  tropopause  height  in  our 
model, and aerosols considerably reduce the magnitude of the 
net height increase.
Figure  14c  compares  observed  and  simulated  month-lati-
 
tude temperature change at three levels observed by satellite. The 
model cools at the lower stratosphere (LS) level. Month-latitude 
features  are  less  prominent  in  the  model  than  in  observations, 
which is expected because (1) a 5-run mean is compared with a 
single realization, and (2) the model’s variability is known to be 
deficient  (see  section  2.4).  Observed  October-January  cooling 
at the South Pole is captured by the model, in which the cool-
ing is a consequence of specified O3 depletion there (Figure 2c). 
Observed temperature changes at the North Pole do not exceed 
the variability among individual runs (Figure 14, bottom row), 
suggesting  that  they  could  be  unforced  variability.  Observed 
equatorial  warming  in  February-April,  which  is  clearer  at  the 
T/S level, seems to be weakly simulated by the model.
The T/S level, with weighting function peaking at 250 hPa, 
 
is within the troposphere at low latitudes, and thus shows warm-
ing at low latitudes in observations and model (Figure 14c). At 
the MT level, with weighting function peaking at 500 hPa, warm-
ing extends to all latitudes except near the South Pole. Cooling 
near the South Pole is a consequence of O3 and GHG changes 
[Thompson  and  Solomon,  2002,  2005;  Shindell  and  Schmidt,

HANSEN ET AL.: CLIMATE SIMULATIONS FOR 1880-2003 WITH GISS MODEL E

2004]. Seasonal variation of the cooling at the South Pole at the 
LS, T/S and MT levels is captured by the model as well as could 
be  expected  given  the  unforced  variability  there  (Figure  13b). 
Associated sea level pressure and wind changes are illustrated 
below. 
5.3. Other Climate Variables
  Many  climate  variables  from  all  of  the  simulations  de-
scribed in this paper are available at data.giss.nasa.gov/modelE/
transient. The runs are organized as summarized in the tables of 
this paper. Diagnostics can be viewed conveniently via the web 
site as color maps and graphs, and the data can be downloaded. 
Figures  15-17  provide  examples  for  several  climate  variables 
for  5-member  ensembles  of  simulations  with  the  coupled  at-
mosphere-ocean  model  driven  by  all  forcings  of  Figure  5  and 
driven by individual forcings. All maps shown here are for the 
same period (1900-2003) to allow appropriate intercomparison 
among  different  variables.  Comparison  with  observations  that 
are  available  only  for  shorter  periods  is  meaningful  in  many 
cases, as most aerosol forcing was added after 1950 and most 
greenhouse  forcing  after  1970  (Figure  5). All  parameters  can 
be viewed and downloaded for arbitrary periods from our web 
site, including results for the forcings not included in Figures 15 
and 16 (CH4-derived H2O and volcanic aerosols) that produced 
the smallest trends for the 1900-2003 period. We excluded these 
two forcings from Figures 15-16 to allow space for maps of two 
standard deviations.
The  bottom  row  in  Figures  15-16  is  the  interannual  stan-
 
dard  deviation  of  the  annual  mean  in  years  1301-1675  of  the 
control run. A forced change exceeding the interannual σ should 
be apparent to casual observers. The next to bottom row of maps 
is  the  standard  deviation  among  104-year  changes  in  the  con-
trol run. A simulated change of the 5-run ensemble-mean for a 
given forcing that exceeds σ is significant at ~95% level, while 
a  change  exceeding  2σ  is  significant  at  >  99%.  Of  course  the 
significance of global mean changes far exceeds the significance 
of local changes. The number on the upper right of these maps is 
the global mean of the local standard deviation. 
5.3.1.  Radiation-related  quantities.  The  first  column  of 
 
Figure 15 is the simulated 1900-2003 change of net radiation at 
the top of the atmosphere based on the local linear trend. Posi-
tive radiation is downward. The 1900-2003 linear trend for all 
forcings operating at once is an increase of 0.5 W/m2 of radiation 
into  the  planet.  Greenhouse  gases  cause  an  increase  of  about 
1 W/m2, but the aerosol direct and indirect forcings reduce the 
planetary  radiation  imbalance  by  almost  half,  as  the  dominant 
effect of increasing aerosols and clouds is to increase reflection 
of  solar  radiation  to  space.  Incoming  net  radiation  increases 
in  the  tropics  and  Southern  Ocean  (mainly  due  to  well-mixed 
GHGs),  while  it  decreases  at  middle  latitudes  in  the  Northern 
Hemisphere  (due  to  aerosol  direct  and  indirect  forcings).  We 
note that tropical (20N-20S) net radiation imbalance +1.4 W/m2 
for  the  past  two  decades  (a  period  including  about  half  of  the 
increase in climate forcing for the century) measured by satellite 
[Wong et al., 2006] is consistent with the sign and approximate 
magnitude  of  the  “all  forcing”  net  radiation  change  in  Figure 
15.
 
Cloud cover increases in most of the Northern Hemisphere 
in the climate simulations, on average by more than 1% of the 
sky  cover  (Figure  15  column  2).  Cloud  cover  increase  is  due 
mainly to the aerosol indirect effect, which primarily increases 
low clouds and thus causes surface cooling. Greenhouse gases 

and  resulting  global  warming,  by  themselves,  lead  to  a  small 
overall decrease of cloud cover in the GISS model [Del Genio 
et al., 2005]. The cloud changes occurring as a climate feedback 
are distributed in all layers, and their net effect on global surface 
temperature  is  near  neutral  [Del  Genio  et  al.,  2005].  Modeled 
cloud changes as a function of altitude are available on the GISS 
web site.
Local modeled cloud cover changes at some locations ex-
 
ceed the local standard deviation (second row from bottom of 
Figure  15)  for  unforced  variability  of  the  simulated  104-year 
change. However, note that σ increases for the shorter period of 
most observations, e.g., σ is about twice as large for a 25-year 
period compared to a 100-year period (Figure 11, bottom row). 
In  addition,  changes  in  cloud  observing  procedures  with  time 
make it difficult to detect reliably cloud changes of the expected 
magnitudes [Warren and Hahn, 2003], and the cloud ‘observa-
tions’ in Figure 15 [Mitchell et al., 2004] are in part proxy es-
timates inferred from observed changes in the amplitude of the 
diurnal cycle of surface air temperature. Thus little trust can be 
placed in these ‘observed’ cloud changes.
  Modeled solar radiation (SW, for shortwave) incident on the 
ground (Figure 15 column 3) decreases substantially, especially 
in the Northern Hemisphere. Despite increased cloud cover, re-
duced SW at the surface is primarily the direct effect of anthro-
pogenic aerosols (compare 2nd and 8th rows in Fig. 15). The re-
duction is due mainly to strongly absorbing BC aerosols, as the 
main effect of non-absorbing aerosols is to convert direct down-
ward radiation to diffuse downward radiation. The breakdown 
by  aerosol  composition  can  be  seen  on  the  GISS  web  site  for 
the  Efficacy  [2005]  paper  (data.giss.nasa.gov/efficacy),  which 
includes 120-year simulations for individual aerosol types. The 
observational SW data in Figure 15 [Gilgen et al., 1998] is for 
the period 1950-1990, which includes more than half of the an-
thropogenic aerosol increase in our model (Figure 3c). Observed 
decrease of SW in the United States is larger than in the simula-
tions,  however,  analyses  based  on  observed  sunshine  duration 
[Stanhill and  Cohen,  2001]  for  1900-1985  suggest  that  longer 
period  changes  in  the  United  States  were  smaller.  The  large 
simulated decrease in SW in China is in good agreement with 
observations for 1961-2000 [Che et al., 2005]. 
  Modeled snow and ice cover (Figure 15 column 4) decreas-
es for all forcings together, with GHGs being the most effective 
forcing mechanism. Snow increases in regions of deforestation, 
if land use change is the only forcing, but with ‘all forcings’ this 
effect is overridden by global warming. The ‘observed’ change 
includes only the sea ice change of Rayner et al. [2003], which 
has about a factor of two greater sea ice loss than simulated by 
our  model.  If  the  Rayner  et  al.  [2003]  data  are  approximately 
correct, the sea ice formulation in the GISS model may be too 
stable,  implying  that  climate  sensitivity  in  the  model  III  ver-
sion of modelE may be too small. However, we suggest in Ap-
pendix A  that  much  of  the  large  sea  ice  change  in  the  Rayner 
et al. [2003] data set (Figure 9a) could be spurious. The large 
rapid sea ice decrease between 1940 and 1945, e.g., occurs in 
the Southern Hemisphere, where no warming is evident at that 
time. Available data on sea ice is inhomogeneous in time, and it 
is possible, for example, that regions of open water behind the 
ice edges may be unaccounted for in early sparse observations.
 
Column 5 in Figure 15 is the change of the amplitude of the 
diurnal cycle of surface air temperature. With all climate forc-
ings applied, almost all land regions on Earth are calculated to 
have  a  decrease  in  the  amplitude  of  Ts,  by  a  few  tenths  of  a

degree Celsius up to a maximum of about 1°C. GHGs and aero-
sols (both direct and indirect effects) are principal contributors 
to damping of the diurnal cycle. The indicated impact of each 
forcing  on  the  diurnal  cycle  includes  the  effect  of  feedbacks, 
e.g., increased water vapor and cloud changes. In the case of the 
well-mixed GHGs the primary mechanism reducing the diurnal 
cycle is increased water vapor, and thus, since the GHG global 
warming exceeds actual warming, in a sense the contribution of 
the GHGs is exaggerated. To the contrary, the impact of aero-
sols and clouds on the diurnal cycle in Figure 15 is an under-
statement of their direct effect, as it includes a negative water 
vapor contribution. Observed diurnal changes in Figure 15 are 
an inhomogeneous data collection [Mitchell et al., 2004], but it 
is clear [Karl et al., 1993] that there has been a decrease of the 
amplitude of the diurnal cycle over most land areas of the globe 
by several tenths of a degree Celsius, comparable in magnitude 
to the simulated change.
Pan  evaporation  is  closely  associated  with  radiation  vari-
 
ables. Observed pan evaporation decreased over most land ar-
eas during the few decades preceding about 1990 [Stanhill and 
Cohen, 2001; Roderick and Farquhar, 2002; Ohmura and Wild, 
2002]. Figure 16 shows the Penman potential evaporation [Rind 
et al., 1997] over land and actual evaporation over the ocean. Pan 
evaporation can be approximated as 0.7 times potential evapora-
tion  [Roderick  and  Farquhar,  2002].  Simulated  reductions  of 
evaporation over most land areas are comparable in magnitude 
to  those  reported  in  the  above  references  for  the  latter  half  of 
the 20th century. It is apparent that at almost any location twice 
the standard deviation (2nd row from bottom of Figure 16) ex-
ceeds the locally simulated change of evaporation, with the large 
variability associated with the large unforced cloud variability. 
However,  there  is  in  general  a  clear  decrease  of  pan  evapora-
tion over land, which is consistent with observations. Figure 16 
indicates that the aerosol direct and indirect effects are primarily 
responsible for reduced potential evaporation over land.
 
Overall,  we  conclude  that  there  is  good  qualitative  and 
semi-quantitative  agreement  between  simulated  radiation-re-
lated  quantities  and  observations,  e.g.,  with  the  phenomenon 
of “global dimming” [Stanhill and Cohen, 2001; Liepert, 2002; 
Cohen et al., 2004], the reduction of solar radiation incident on 
the surface. Our model results indicate that dimming is due pri-
marily to absorbing aerosols and secondarily to the aerosol in-
direct effect on clouds. The same forcings are principal causes 
of a decrease in the amplitude of the diurnal cycle of surface air 
temperature, such a decrease being in accord with observational 
evidence [Karl et al., 1993]. The model yields a significant in-
crease of global mean cloud cover, largely due to the aerosol in-
direct effect, but the local effect does not generally exceed local 
unforced variability in the model. Large positive global net radi-
ation imbalance simulated for the past decade, due to increasing 
GHGs,  is  confirmed  by  comparison  of  model  results  [Hansen 
et al., 2005b; Delworth et al., 2005] with observations of ocean 
heat storage [Willis et al., 2004; Levitus et al., 2005; Lyman et 
al., 2006]. A positive energy imbalance in the tropics is consis-
tent with satellite observations [Wong et al., 2006], although it is 
a challenge to obtain an accuracy in satellite observations that is 
sufficient to measure the small simulated radiation imbalance.
5.3.2.  Precipitation  and  run-off.  Well-mixed  GHGs  by 
 
themselves yield large increases of simulated global precipita-
tion and run-off (Figure 16 columns 7 and 8), with precipitation 
generally  increasing  in  the  tropics  and  at  high  latitudes  while 
decreasing in the subtropics, as found in many prior modeling 

studies  [IPCC,  2001].  A  tendency  for  these  changes  remains 
when all forcings are applied, but the additional forcings make 
the hydrologic changes weaker and more variable at middle and 
high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, as direct and indirect 
aerosol effects tend to reduce precipitation and run-off.
Simulated changes of precipitation and run-off at a given lo-
 
cation are usually smaller than unforced variability of the trends 
among individual model runs (Figure 16, 2nd row from bottom) 
and  much  less  than  interannual  variability  (bottom  row). This 
large  unforced  variability  makes  it  difficult  to  predict  local  or 
regional hydrologic changes. Nevertheless, we notice some con-
sistent  tendencies  among  the  present  runs  and  a  large  number 
of  additional  runs  with  slightly  altered  forcings  (section  6  be-
low  and  Efficacy  [2005])  including  decreased  precipitation  in 
the Southwest United States, the Mediterranean region, and the 
Sahel, but increased precipitation in the Eastern United States. 
Precipitation  observations  compiled  by  Mitchell  et  al.  [2004] 
have increased precipitation in most areas, although decreases 
in the Sahel and Mediterranean, with little change in the south-
west  United  States.  Note  that  the  Mitchell  et  al.  [2004]  data, 
graphically available for arbitrary periods on the GISS web site, 
have more moderate changes over the past half century (when 
the data are probably more reliable)and better agreement with 
the model results.
5.3.3.  Sea  level  pressure  and  surface  wind.  GHGs  have 
 
the largest effect on annual-mean sea level pressure and surface 
zonal  wind  around Antarctica  in  our  simulations  (Figure  16), 
exceeding  the  noise  in  long-term  trends  and  rivaling  interan-
nual variations (bottom two rows, Figure 16). Ozone and solar 
irradiance  changes  reinforce  the  effect  of  GHGs,  but  aerosols 
work in the opposite sense by cooling low latitudes. Thus sur-
face  pressure  and  zonal  wind  changes  for  all forcings  are  less 
than for GHGs alone. Observations concur with the net effects, 
as pressure has decreased over the Antarctic continent and wind 
speed has increased at most coastal stations [Turner et al., 2005], 
which is a trend toward the positive phase of the Southern An-
nular Mode (SAM) [Thompson and Wallace, 2000; Hartmann et 
al., 2000].
Kindem  and  Christiansen  [2001]  and  Sexton  [2001]  used 
 
observed stratospheric O3 depletion scenarios in global climate 
models to show that O3 change yielded stratospheric cooling and 
a trend toward the positive phase of SAM. Thompson and Solo-
mon [2002] showed that O3 changes were consistent with trends 
of temperature and zonal wind as a function of season and alti-
tude, and that O3 depletion was probably responsible for a slight 
surface cooling trend in East Antarctica, conclusions supported 
by climate simulations of Gillett and Thompson [2003].
Fyfe et al. [1999] and Kushner et al. [2001] found that well-
 
mixed GHGs also induce a positive response of the SAM in their 
models, as upper tropospheric warming and lower stratospheric 
cooling strengthen the polar vortex in all seasons. This effect is 
enhanced by minimal warming in the deep-mixing circum-Ant-
arctic Southern Ocean during the transient climate phase. Cai et 
al. [2003] find that stabilizing the GHG amount would weaken 
the  SAM,  as  the  high  latitude  surface  warms  and  reduces  the 
zonal temperature gradient that drives the subpolar jet stream.
Shindell  and  Schmidt  [2004],  with  a  version  of  the  GISS 
 
model  that  includes  gravity  wave  drag  and  a  higher  model 
top, find comparable contributions of O3 and GHGs to surface 
change, with O3 dominating above the middle troposphere. The 
larger response to GHGs in our present model is likely a tropo-
spheric effect, as we obtain large low-latitude upper-tropospher-

ic  warming  (Figures  13a  and  14),  consistent  with  larger-than-
observed  surface  warming  in  the  tropical  Pacific  Ocean  (over 
most periods, albeit not over 1950-2003, Figure 11). The larger-
than-observed tropical Pacific warming and upper tropospheric 
warming  in  the  satellite  era  disappear  when  we  use  observed 
SSTs,  as  noted  in  section  5.1.1  and  Table  2.  Given  the  large 
fluctuations  of  observed  tropical  Pacific  warming  (Figure  11), 
we suggest that the discrepancy between our ensemble mean re-
sult and the real world’s single realization in the satellite period 
(1979-2003),  including  surface  cooling  of  the Antarctic  conti-
nent, could be a reflection of real world variability rather than a 
model flaw. Indeed, despite the lack of ENSO-like variability in 
the present model, some ensemble members have cooling over 
East Antarctica  in  1979-2003.  Quantitative  analysis  requires  a 
version of the model with more realistic tropical variability.
Observed warming in recent decades (Figure 11) and warm-
 
ing simulated by a large IPCC ensemble of many climate models 
in response to increasing GHGs [Carril et al., 2005] is concen-
trated in the Amundson Sea-Antarctic Peninsula-Western Wed-
dell Sea region, where recent acceleration of outlet glaciers has 
been noted [Thomas et al., 2004; Cook et al., 2004]. Despite the 
coarse resolution of our model, the warming pattern that we ob-
tain with “all forcings” is consistent with results of the ensemble 
of IPCC models [Carril et al., 2005].
5.3.4. Zonal mean quantities. Figure 17 shows 5-run en-
 
semble mean changes of zonal mean temperature, water vapor, 
zonal wind, and stream function produced by each forcing for 
1950-2003 and 1979-2003 as a function of altitude and latitude. 
Control  run  values  of  these  quantities  are  shown  in  Efficacy 
[2005]. The standard deviation for each quantity among changes 
in 54-year and 25-year segments of the control run are shown in 
the bottom row of Figure 17.
Conspicuous  features  in  the  zonal  temperature  response 
 
were discussed in connection with Figures 13-14. Water vapor 
changes, including stratospheric H2O, mainly reflect tropospher-
ic  temperature  change,  except  for  forcings  that  directly  alter 
stratospheric  temperature. The  large  stratospheric  H2O  change 
due  to  CH4-oxidation  warms  the  upper  troposphere  but  barely 
affects the surface temperature.
 
Note the large unforced variability of zonal winds at high 
latitudes. In the Northern Hemisphere only GHGs produce a re-
sponse  exceeding  the  variability  among  runs,  and  only  on  the 
54-year period, not 25 years. A greater zonal-wind response is 
obtained in the Southern Hemisphere for GHG and O3 forcings, 
but the effect at the surface exceeds unforced variability only for 
GHGs on the longer time scale.
The salient change of the meridional stream function caused 
 
by “all forcings” is a strengthening of the overturning Brewer-
Dobson circulation in the stratosphere. However, response of the 
Hadley circulation in the lower troposphere is the opposite, i.e., 
a weakening. These changes are due mainly to the well-mixed 
GHGs. Knutson and Manabe [1995] and Held and Soden [2006] 
show  that  weakening  of  mean  overturning  in  the  lower  tropo-
sphere, including the Walker circulation, is due to the increasing 
proportion of vertical energy flux carried by  moist convection 
as  global  warming  increases.  Changes  of  the  stream  function 
for  different  forcings  are  more  systematic  and  apparent  when 
viewed for individual seasons as in Efficacy [2005], where it is 
shown that stream function changes are approximately propor-
tional to the effective forcing Fe and in the opposite sense for 
positive and negative Fe.

5.4. Alternative Aerosol Forcings
 
A primary discrepancy between our simulated global tem-
perature change and observations is the small modeled warming 
at middle latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. A likely cause 
of this deficient warming is the large increase of aerosol optical 
depth  in  our  model  between  1880  and  2003.  Causes  of  large 
aerosol optical depth in our model include (see section 3.2.1):
(1) Sulfate optical depths are from results of Koch [2001] 
 
available at the time our “IPCC” runs were initiated. More re-
cent results of Koch [priv. comm.], based on new emission data 
and more efficient removal including the effect of heterogeneous 
chemical reactions of sulfate and mineral dust [Bauer and Koch, 
2005], reduce the sulfate optical depth about 50%.
 
(2) Our aerosol distributions were calculated at coarse tem-
poral  intervals  (section  3.2),  the  most  recent  date  being  1990, 
after  which  aerosol  amount  is  constant  (except  nitrate,  which 
increases  in  proportion  to  global  population). Thus  we  do  not 
capture post-1990 aerosol decreases in Europe and the United 
States  [see  section  5.1],  nor  aerosol  increases  in  developing 
countries.
It would be useful to rerun some of our experiments with 
 
the best current estimates of global aerosol distributions. How-
ever, several significant improvements of our ocean and atmo-
sphere models are also now practical. Thus we plan to repeat the 
transient climate change experiments with the next documented 
version  of  our  climate  model  using  the  best  data  then  avail-
able for aerosols and other transient climate forcings. Here we 
only make two aerosol sensitivity runs with the present climate 
model, to provide an indication of how changes in the assumed 
aerosols affect the simulated climate.
 
In the aerosol “½ Sulfates” experiment the sulfate changes 
were reduced by 50%, which also reduced the (negative) AIE by 
about 18%. In the “½ Sulfates + 2x[Biomass Burning]” experi-
ment the temporal change of BC and OC aerosols from biomass 
burning was doubled, in addition to the reduction of fossil fuel 
sulfates. Figure 18 summarizes the impact of these alternative 
aerosol histories on the simulated temperature change, compar-
ing the results with observations and the standard “all forcing” 
model runs.
The  reduction  of  sulfates,  which  changes  the  net  aerosol 
 
1880-2003 global forcing from –1.37 W/m2 to –0.91 W/m2, in-
creases global warming from 0.53 to 0.75°C for 1880-2003 and 
from  0.40  to  0.53°C  for  1950-2003.  Doubling  of  the  biomass 
burning  aerosol  change  has  little  further  effect  on  global  tem-
perature (Figure 18a) as the warming from added BC approxi-
mately cancels cooling from added OC.
Both  alternative  aerosol  distributions  increase  the  warm-
 
ing at middle latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere to a realistic 
level  as  a  result  of  reduced  reflective  (sulfate)  aerosol  optical 
depth. Given the evidence that our standard aerosol amount was 
excessive, and does not include post-1990 changes, it is likely 
that aerosols are a principal factor that needs to be improved in 
the standard forcings. However, the present alternative distribu-
tions should only be viewed as sensitivity studies, as acceptable 
alternatives need to be obtained from first principles using im-
proved aerosol observations and modeling.
 
There  is  notable  polar  amplification  of  simulated  surface 
warming in the Northern Hemisphere over the past half century 
and longer periods, in the cases with aerosol amount reduced to 
a level that yields realistic mid-latitude warming (Figure 18c). 
However,  observed  polar  amplification  fluctuates  greatly  de-
pending on the period considered, which is a reflection of how

‘noisy’ high latitude temperature is [Sorteberg et al., 2005; Bitz 
and Goosse, 2006.
 
The gray band in Figure 18c is defined by the 1σ variation 
in the 5-member ensemble of runs for our standard case with all 
forcings. As would be expected, for some periods and latitudes 
the observations fall outside the 1σ range, although almost all 
cases are within 2σ. Note the great variability of observed high 
latitude  temperature  change  depending  on  the  period  consid-
ered and the large unforced variability of the polar temperatures 
among model runs. Given that the real world represents a single 
realization, the large unforced variability at high latitudes indi-
cates that observed climate changes at high latitudes should be 
interpreted with caution.

6.  Summary: Model and Data Limitations and Potential

  We summarize model limitations and capabilities (section 
6.1)  and  briefly  discuss  (section  6.2)  why,  despite  the  model 
limitations, extension of model runs into the future can provide 
meaningful results. In section 6.3 we summarize lessons learned 
that may be helpful for future climate simulations.
6.1. Global Climate Change: 1880-2003
Our climate model, driven by all of the estimated forcings, 
 
simulates  observed  global  mean  temperature  change  over  the 

period 1880-2003 reasonably well. The results fit observations 
better if tropospheric aerosol change is smaller over Europe than 
it is in our standard ‘all forcing’ run. There are independent rea-
sons to believe that a reduced aerosol change there is more real-
istic, as discussed in section 5.4.
 
The  match  of  simulated  and  observed  global  temperature 
curves is not an indication that knowledge of climate sensitiv-
ity  and  the  mechanisms  causing  climate  change  is  as  accurate 
as suggested by that fit. An equally good match to observations 
probably could be obtained from a model with larger sensitivity 
(than 2.9°C for doubled CO2) and smaller net forcing, or a model 
with smaller sensitivity and larger forcing. Indeed, although de-
tailed temporal and spatial patterns of climate change, in prin-
ciple,  may  allow  extraction  of  inferences  about  both  climate 
sensitivity and forcings, in practice the large unforced variabil-
ity  of  climate,  uncertainties  in  observed  climate  change,  poor 
knowledge  of  aerosol  forcings,  and  imprecision  in  the  model-
generated response to forcings make it difficult to place useful 
quantitative limits on climate sensitivity from observed climate 
change of the past century.
 
On the other hand, paleoclimate evidence of climate change 
between  periods  with  well-known  boundary  conditions  (forc-
ings) yields a climate sensitivity 3±1°C for doubled CO2 [Han-

HANSEN ET AL.: CLIMATE SIMULATIONS FOR 1880-2003 WITH GISS MODEL E

sen et al., 1993], so our model sensitivity of 2.9°C for doubled 
CO2 is reasonable. The realistic response of this model to the ac-
curately known short-term forcing by Pinatubo volcanic aerosols 
and the realistic rate of simulated global warming in the past 3-4 
decades, when greenhouse gases increased so rapidly that they 
dominated over other estimated forcings (Figure 5), suggest that 
approximate agreement between observed and simulated global 
temperature is not fortuitous.
 
The  largest  discrepancy  in  simulated  1880-2003  surface 
temperature change, other than deficient warming in Eurasia, is 
warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean that exceeds observations 
(Figure  11).  Cane  et  al.  [1997]  suggest  that  reduced  warming 
in that region may occur with global warming due to increased 
frequency or intensity of La Ninas, but among all models there is 
a slight tendency toward increased El Ninos with global warm-
ing [Collins et al., 2005]. Our present model would not be able 
to capture a change in ENSO variability, whether forced or un-
forced.  However,  note  that  the  existence  of  a  discrepancy  in 
Pacific Ocean warming depends on the period considered. For 
example,  our  modeled  tropical  Pacific  warming  is  larger  than 
observed for 1880-2003, but not for 1950-2003 (Figures 11 and 
18c). We conclude that observed variability in tropical surface 
temperature trends is a strong function of ENSO variability, and 
the differences between observations and simulations in this re-
gion may be due simply to unforced variability.
 
The  greatest  apparent  discrepancy  with  observations  of 
temperature change versus altitude is the large simulated warm-
ing in the tropical upper troposphere. On the 50-year time scale 
there  is  no  clear  evidence  that  modeled  upper  tropospheric 
warming exceeds observations, given increasing evidence that 
deficient warming there in radiosonde records may be a figment 
of inhomogeneities in the radiosonde data sources [Sherwood et 
al., 2005; Free and Seidel, 2005; Santer et al., 2005b; Karl et 
al., 2006]. However, on shorter time scales our modeled upper 
tropospheric  warming  trend  is  excessive,  as  shown  most  con-
vincingly by MSU T/S data for 1987-2003. But this excessive 
upper  tropospheric  warming  disappears  when  we  use  ocean A 
(observed SSTs) instead of the fully coupled atmosphere-ocean 
model (complete ocean A results are available at data.giss.nasa.
gov/modelE/transient).  Thus  the  excessive  upper  tropospheric 
warming is a reflection of larger than observed warming of the 
tropical Pacific Ocean in the coupled model. Real world trends 
toward La Nina conditions for 1987-2003, toward El Nino condi-
tions for 1950-2003, and slightly toward La Nina conditions for 
1880-2003 (Figure 11) are within the range of Southern Oscil-
lation variability. There is no reason to expect our model to cap-
ture this specific ENSO variability, and there is no inconsistency 
between  upper  tropospheric  and  surface  temperature  changes. 
Thus we anticipate that magnified warming in the tropical upper 
troposphere will become apparent as the tropical ocean contin-
ues to warm in response to increasing GHGs.
In summary, simulated climate change for the past century 
 
does not agree in detail with observations, nor would it be ex-
pected  to  agree,  given  unforced  climate  variability,  uncertain-
ty in climate forcings, and current model  limitations. But  in  a 
broad sense our climate model does a credible job of simulating 
observed global temperature change in response to short time-
scale (volcanic aerosol) as well as century time-scale forcings. 
This model capability provides sufficient reason to examine the 
model for information about large-scale regional climate effects 
of practical importance and to extend the climate simulations to 
investigate potential global consequences of alternative climate 

forcing scenarios.
6.2. Extended Simulations
 
Given the large uncertainty in the net climate forcing during 
the past century (section 3.4), due mainly to aerosols, it may be 
questioned whether useful accuracy can be achieved in simula-
tions of the future. However, GHG climate forcing is expected to 
be dominant over aerosol forcing in the future, indeed, it seems 
likely that at least a moderate decrease of aerosol amount will 
occur [Andreae et al., 2005]. Therefore, given a specified GHG 
scenario,  with  large  increases  of  GHGs  as  projected  by  IPCC 
[2001], the relative uncertainty in the net forcing is reasonably 
small.
 
Thus continuations of some of our present 1880-2003 sim-
ulations  into  the  future  seems  justified. We  have  extended  the 
1880-2003 “all forcing” simulations of this paper to 2100, and 
in a few cases to 2300 using fixed 2003 forcings, several IPCC 
GHG  scenarios,  and  the  “alternative”  and  “2°C”  scenarios  of 
Hansen  and  Sato  [2004].  These  extended  simulations  are  de-
scribed in Dangerous [2006].
6.3. Lessons Learned
 
Our control run had negligible stratospheric aerosols, rep-
resenting  only  “background”  conditions  far  removed  from  the 
injection of aerosols by large volcanoes. If volcanic aerosols are 
to be included as a forcing in experiment runs, the use of ocean 
initial conditions from a control run without volcanic aerosols 
yields misleading results, especially for ocean heat storage.
 
In Appendix A.1 we suggest that inclusion of a mean aero-
sol amount in the control run significantly improves realism of 
results. We now include in our control runs a mean stratospheric 
aerosol  optical  thickness  τ  =  0.0125  at  0.55  μm  wavelength, 
which  is  the  1850-2000  mean  value  of  the  Sato  et  al.  [1993] 
aerosol climatology. Other researchers may wish to consider in-
cluding this mean stratospheric aerosol amount in their control 
runs.
 
Other “lessons learned” discussed in Appendix A concern 
methods to minimize the effect of model drift and the effect of 
mixed definitions of surface air temperature. We also describe 
minor errors in ozone forcing and the forcing due to black car-
bon deposition on snow.

Appendix A: Minor Errors and Lessons Learned

  We  discovered  several  minor  errors  or  oversights  in  car-
rying out the climate simulations for this paper. We document 
these for the sake of avoiding similar problems in future climate 
studies.

A.1. Mean Stratospheric Aerosols in Control Run
 
Our  control  run  had  no  stratospheric  aerosols.  Aerosols 
from the 1883 Krakatau eruption caused ocean heat content in 
the experiment runs to fall below that in the control run, as ex-
pected. However, despite steadily increasing greenhouse gases, 
the ocean heat content did not recover to that of the control run 
until about 2000. In reality, ocean temperature is also influenced 
by  volcanoes  that  erupted  prior  to  1880.  Ideally,  ocean  initial 
conditions in 1880 would be obtained from a spin-up run that 
had  time-dependent  forcings,  including  volcanoes,  for  several 
centuries prior to 1880. That is not usually practical, if for no 
other reason than the absence of information on earlier volcanic 
eruptions.  However,  it  is  easy  to  include  a  mean  stratospheric 
aerosol amount in the control run.
 

Current control runs with our model include a mean strato-

air temperature at 10 m altitude, Tx substitutes SST for Ts over the ocean. Ocean A uses the SST and sea ice 
history of Rayner et al. [2003] coupled to atmospheric modelE, while ocean C couples modelE with the Rus-
sell et al. [1995] ocean model.

spheric aerosol optical thickness τ = 0.0125 at 0.55 μm wave-
length,  which  is  the  1850-2000  mean  value  of  the  Sato  et  al. 
[1993]  aerosol  climatology.  The  equilibrium  global  (surface) 
cooling for τ = 0.0125 (10% of the maximum τ for Pinatubo) 
is ~0.2°C, and the effect on deeper ocean temperatures is suf-
ficient to alter the rate of ocean heat storage in transient climate 
simulations. Using a control run in which the ocean temperature 
had equilibrated with an atmosphere including this mean aero-
sol amount, we carried out an ensemble of runs for 1850-2003. 
The concentration of volcanoes near the end of the 19th century 
caused the ocean heat content anomaly to be negative for several 
decades, but it recovered to the control run value by the mid 20th 
century  and  it  subsequently  increased  at  a  rate  comparable  to 
that reported by Levitus et al. [2000].

A.2. Control Run Disequilibrium and Drift.
 
Our  coupled  atmosphere-ocean  (ocean  C)  simulations,  to 
meet  the  deadline  for  submission  to  IPCC,  were  initiated  be-
fore  the  control  run  (which  provides  initial  conditions  for  the 
experiments) had reached equilibrium, i.e., while there was still 
an imbalance between the amounts of energy absorbed and emit-
ted by the planet. As a result, the model response to any forcing 
included a small drift.
  We minimize drift effects by subtracting, year-by-year, the 
same  quantities  from  the  same  period  of  the  control  run. This 
procedure yields diagnostics with ‘double noise’, i.e., it contains 
unforced  variability  of  both  the  control  and  experiment  runs, 
while the real world has only a single source of unforced vari-
ability. Double noise can be minimized by initiating additional 
control runs at the same points at which experiments are initi-
ated.
An alternative way to remove drift is to calculate and sub-
 
tract  from  the  experiment  result  the  mean  drift  in  the  control 
over the period of the experiment. For example, for a 124-year 

1880-2003 experiment initiated at year X of the control run, we 
could calculate the linear trends of control run diagnostics over 
the period X to X + 123 and subtract the control run diagnostics 
based on their linear trends from the corresponding quantities in 
the  experiment  run. This  alternative  procedure  avoids  year-to-
year double noise, but it does not eliminate drift effects entirely 
because variability occurs on all time scales.
 
Noise effects were exacerbated by the fact that most of our 
experiments,  with  individual  forcings  and  with  multiple  forc-
ings,  were  initiated  at  the  same  points  of  the  control  run. The 
control run has unforced variability not only interannually, but 
on  124-year  and  all  other  time  scales.  Thus  when  we  add  up 
responses to individual forcings, with drift subtracted, we are in-
cluding the same unforced 124 year fluctuation for each forcing. 
Therefore  we  cannot  expect  the  sum  of  the  responses  to  indi-
vidual forcings to equal the response to the sum of the forcings, 
even if there is no non-linearity in the climate response.
 
An  improved  procedure  would  be  to  initiate  experiments 
for  different  forcings  at  different  points  on  the  control  run,  in 
addition to spacing ensemble members. It would perhaps be still 
better  to  carry  out  a  long  control  run  that  reaches  equilibrium 
before experiments are initiated, so there would be no need to 
subtract a control run. However, the merits of waiting until the 
control  run  equilibrates  before  initiating  experiments  may  be 
reduced  if  the  equilibrium  climate  drifts  too  far  from  the  real 
world.
A.3.	Surface	Temperature	Definition.
Surface air temperature (Ts) in modelE is calculated at 10 
 
m  height.  The  land-ocean  temperature  index  (Tx)  [Hansen  et 
al.,  2001]  is  from  observations  at  2  m  height  at  meteorologi-
cal stations and SST data of Rayner et al. [2003] and Reynolds 
and Smith [1994] over the ocean. Temperature changes of model 
and observations are compared, which minimizes, but does not 
eliminate, the effect of these height differences.

Figure  19  shows  the  modeled  1880-2003  temperature 
change for (1) ocean A driven by no forcings except SST and 
sea ice change, (2) the same as (1) but including “all forcings” 
(GHGs, aerosols, etc.), (3) the same as (2), but for the coupled 
atmosphere-ocean climate model. For each of these three mod-
els we show the global surface air temperature (Ts), the tempera-
ture index (Tx), which uses the ocean temperature instead of Ts 
for ocean areas, and their difference.
In the case of ocean A with no forcings, Ts and Tx are prac-
 
tically the same on global average, even though there are regions 
where  they  differ  by  a  few  tenths  of  a  degree.  In  the  case  of 
ocean A with radiative forcings, the forcings are able to change 
atmospheric  temperature  slightly  even  though  SST  is  fixed. 
Global mean Ts increases 0.03ºC more than Tx increases over 
the period 1880-2003. In the case of ocean C the ocean tempera-
ture is able to respond to the change of near surface temperature 
gradient, and Ts increases 0.05ºC more than Tx increases over 
the 1880-2003 period.
 
These comparisons indicate that our use of global Ts at 10 
m height overstates global mean ∆T by several hundredths of a 
degree, if our aim is comparison with a temperature index that 
uses SSTs. We could employ ∆Tx from the model based on the 
first layer ocean temperature, but that would be inconsistent with 
the procedure used in previous studies with the GISS model and 
other models, and thus we used ∆Ts in this paper. This issue may 
be  noticeable  only  in  the  GISS  model,  which  calculates Ts  in 
an iterative fashion [Hansen et al., 1983; modelE, 2006]. In the 
future the issue might be practically eliminated by calculating Ts 
at 2 m height, rather than 10 m.
 
These  small  changes  in  ∆T  do  not  alter  the  geographical 
pattern  of  the  discrepancy  between  model  and  observations. 
The main implication is that the 124-year warming in our model 
with  “all  forcings”  is  ~0.10ºC  less  than  observed,  rather  than 
0.05ºC less. Thus the need for less tropospheric aerosol amount 
becomes clearer in the global mean temperature, as well as from 
unrealistic cooling over Europe.
 
As future models are better able to simulate observed cli-
mate  change,  it  will  be  worth  removing  any  such  discrepancy 
in  comparison  with  observed  surface  temperature. We  are  un-
certain  whether  this  comparison  issue  exists  for  other  climate 
models.

A.4. Ozone Scenario.
 
The first set of runs that we provided to IPCC inadvertently 
used the Randel and Wu [1999] decadal rate of stratospheric O3 
depletion as the 18-year change, thus understating stratospheric 
O3 depletion by the factor 10/18. Corrected runs were submit-
ted several months later, and both sets of runs remain available 
at www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/about_ipcc.php. The correction re-
duced the 1880-2003 global forcing Fa by 0.03 W/m2. The main 
impact of the correction was on stratospheric cooling in the Ant-
arctic region during the time of O3 depletion, with the corrected 
results providing better agreement with observations. The pres-
ent paper and Efficacy [2005] use the corrected O3 change.
A second issue with the O3 scenario concerns O3 forcing due 
 
to tropospheric pollution. The O3 scenario was derived from an 
off-line simulation of a tropospheric chemistry model [Shindell 
et al., 2003], which yielded an 1880-2000 O3 change from the 
surface to the 150 hPa level at all latitudes. Global forcings for 
this O3 change were Fi = 0.44, Fa = 0.38 W/m2. However, tropo-
spheric O3 forcing implemented in our transient simulations was 
less, as high-latitude O3 increases above the model’s tropopause 
(Figure 3 of Efficacy [2005]) were excluded, reducing O3 forc-
ing by 0.05 W/m2. As the pollution effect on O3 at low latitudes 
was only allowed to reach the 150 hPa level, we suspect that our 
total O3 forcing (Fa = 0.28, Fs = 0.26, Fe = 0.23 W/m2, including 
tropospheric  pollution  and  stratospheric  depletion,  from  Table 
1) underestimates actual O3 forcing. Future O3 scenarios should 
be generated by models with improved vertical resolution and 
higher model top, preferably integrating effects of tropospheric 
pollution and stratospheric change.
A.5. Snow Albedo.
A computer programming error was present in calculated of 
 
snow albedo in several of our climate simulations. Some of these 
runs were repeated with the error corrected, as delineated below. 
Our intention was for snow albedo change to be proportional to 
BC deposition as calculated by the aerosol transport model of 
Koch [2001]. The error caused albedo change to be exaggerated 
in partially snow-covered land gridboxes and understated over 
sea ice, because total albedo change was fixed.
 
Our initial ‘all forcing’ run provided to IPCC contained both 
the ozone error (A.4) and snow albedo error (A.5). We also pro-
vided to IPCC ‘all forcing’ runs with the ozone error corrected

and later runs with both errors corrected. Because of space limi-
tations, the DOE web site includes only the original ‘all forcing’ 
ensemble and the ensemble with the ozone forcing corrected. All 
three ensembles are available on the GISS web site.
The ‘all forcing’ and snow albedo alone enembles were re-
 
run with the snow albedo error corrected. The corrected program 
was  also  used  in  ‘Arctic  pollution’  runs  (Figure  5  in  Danger-
ous  [2006]).  However,  the AltAer1, AltAer3,  and AltSol  runs 
contain  the  snow  albedo  error,  but  not  the  ozone  error.  These 
ensembles were not rerun with corrected snow albedo because 
of the small magnitude of the error and the fact that it would not 
alter conclusions from those runs. To allow precise comparison 
with AltAer1, AltAer2, and AltSol, the standard model results in 
Figure 18 of this paper and Figure 6 in Dangerous [2006] are the 
‘all forcing’ results that include the snow albedo error.
The simulations employed in the energy imbalance study of 
 
Hansen et al. [2005b] contained both errors. The errors in global 
forcing, +0.03 W/m2 and –0.02 W/m2, opposed each other, but 
regional  and  temporal  effects  would  not  cancel,  e.g.,  strato-
spheric cooling over Antarctica was underestimated. However, 
the magnitude of these errors is too small to affect conclusions 
of that paper.
Efficacy  [2005]  simulations  included  the  snow  albedo  er-
 
ror but not the ozone error. In Table 4 and Figure 16 of Efficacy 
[2005] the snow albedo forcing was calculated with the incor-
rect program. Fa was actually 0.05 W/m2, not 0.08 W/m2, and 
the correct efficacy for the snow albedo effect was Ea ~ 2.7, not 
Ea ~ 1.7.

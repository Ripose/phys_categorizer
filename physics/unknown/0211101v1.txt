Abstract

We further study the performance of single, double and triple Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) detectors in pure noble gases at
high pressures, in the range of 1-10 atm. We confirm that light noble gases, in particular He and its mixtures with Kr, have the
highest gain, reaching 106, and an unusual gain dependence on pressure. Effects of the number of GEMs, GEM hole diameter
and pitch are investigated in detail. In He, avalanche-induced secondary scintillations  are observed  at  high  gains,  using  the
metal  photocathode.  These  results  are  relevant  in  the  field  of  avalanche  mechanism  in  noble  gases  and  X-ray,  neutron  and
cryogenic particle detectors.  © 2003 Elsevier Science. All rights reserved

1. Introduction

Operation  of  Gas  Electron  Multiplier    (GEM)  [1]
detectors  in  dense  noble  gases,  i.e.  at  high  pressures
or  at  low  temperatures,  is  relevant  in  the  field  of
cryogenic  particle  detectors  [2],  neutron  [3]  and  X-
ray  imaging  [4]  and  gaseous  photomultipliers  [5].  It
turned  out  that  light  noble  gases,  He  and  Ne,  had
superior  performances  at  high  pressures  in  terms  of
the maximum gain and stability of operation [6,7]. In
addition,  He  and  Ne  showed  an  unusual  gain
dependence on pressure [7]: in a wide pressure range
the operation voltage does not increase with pressure.
Using a simple model of avalanche development, this
was  interpreted  as  a  result  of  a  new  avalanche
mechanism  arising  in  He  and  Ne  at  high  gas
densities, namely the associative ionization [2].

In this paper  we further study the performance of
different  GEM  structures  in  noble  gases,  at  high
pressures,  and  in  particular  in  He,  Kr  and  their

mixture.  He  and  Kr  can  be  considered  as  typical
examples  of  light  and  heavy  noble  gases,  since  the
GEM operation in these gases is rather similar to that
of  Ne  and  Xe,  respectively  [7].  The  effects  of  the
number of GEMs in cascade and GEM hole diameter
and pitch are studied. Photon feedback effects in He
are also investigated.

2. Results

One, two or three GEM foils, a Cu cathode and a
printed-circuit-board  (PCB)  anode  were  mounted  in
cascade  inside  a  high-pressure  vessel.  The  GEMs  of
three  types  were  used  with  the  following  hole
diameter/pitch values: 80/140, 40/140 and 40/100m m.
The  vessel  was  filled  with  pure  He,  Kr  or  their
mixture.  The  detector  was  irradiated  with  an  X-ray
tube. In triple,  double  and  single  GEM  detectors  the
anode  signal  was  read  out  from  the  PCB.  These
modes  of  operation  are  designated  as  3GEM+PCB,
2GEM+PCB  and  1GEM+PCB,  respectively.  The

gain  values  were  determined  in  the  current  mode  of
operation.  More  detailed  description  of 
the
experimental  setup  and  procedures  are  presented
elsewhere [6,7].

Anode signals of a triple GEM detector in He and
Kr  are  shown  in  Fig.  1,  after  a  charge-sensitive
amplifier. In Kr at all gains and in He at gains below
few  thousands  (not  shown)  the  anode  pulse  has  a
triangular shape: a linear pulse rise corresponds to the
integration of the primary signal induced by electron
avalanching.  The  width  of 
the  primary  signal
(FWHM)  is  about  150  and  100  ns  in  He  and  Kr,
respectively.  At  high  gains,  exceeding  104,  the
primary signal in He is accompanied by a secondary
signal  (Fig.1,  top  and  middle).  The  latter  is  due  to
photon feedback between the last GEM  element  and
Cu cathode, induced by secondary scintillations in He
under avalanche conditions.

Indeed, similarly to other noble gases He is a good
scintillator  in  the  vacuum  ultraviolet  (VUV)  region,
with  an  emission  centered  at  80  nm  [8].  And  the
quantum  efficiency  of  Cu  photocathode  at  this
wavelength  is  high  enough,  of  about  10%  [9],  to
provide  the  efficient  photon  feedback.  On  the  other
hand,  the  quantum  efficiency  of  Cu  is  considerably
reduced  at  the  emission  region  of  Kr  (150  nm).
Therefore  the  anode  signal  in  Kr  has  no  secondary
signal (Fig.1, bottom).

In  addition,  the  photon  feedback  in  the  double
GEM is stronger than that of the triple GEM (Fig.1):
at a gain of 104 it amounts to 100% and 20%  of  the
primary  signal,  respectively.  This  is  because  of  the
screening  effect  of  the  multi-GEM  structure:  the
optical transparency of each GEM is  only  10%.  The
characteristic time of He emission, in a gas discharge,
was reported to be of the order of 1 m s [8], which is
compatible with our observations (Fig.1).

In 

these  measurements,

GEM  detector  in  He  and  He+1%Kr,  at  different
pressures. 
the  photon
feedback was reduced compared to that of Fig.1 and
ref. [7]: the middle GEM had a reduced hole diameter
(40 m m). Therefore somewhat higher gains, reaching
106,  are  obtained  here,  compared  to  the  previous
results [7].

One  can  see,  that  in  the  range  of  1-5  atm  the
operation  voltage  in  He  almost  does  not  change,  in
accordance  with  earlier  observation  [7].  In  [2]  this

behavior  was  explained  by  a  new  avalanche
mechanism, namely the associative ionization, taking
over  the  impact  ionization  at  high  pressures.  In  the
associative  ionization,  the  electron  is  produced  via
association  of  an  atom  with  an  excited  atom  into  a
molecular ion [10]: He + He* ﬁ  He+

2 + e-.

As was pointed out in [2], at the background of the
associative ionization the effects of impurities and in
particular  the  Penning  effect  are  not  seen  at  high
pressures.  This  statement  is  supported  by  gain-
voltage characteristics in He+1%Kr (Fig.2), which is
a  Penning  mixture  by  definition.  Indeed,  it  is  well
known that at low pressures Penning effect results in
lowering the operation voltage, compared to pure gas.
However,  this  is  not  the  case  at  high  pressures:  one
can  see  that  the  operation  voltage  in  He+Kr  either
does  not  differ  from  that  of  pure  He  (at  1atm)  or
increases with pressure.

It  is  interesting  that  at  gains  exceeding  105,  the
gain  increase  with  voltage  is  faster  than  exponential
in  He  and  slower  than  exponential  in  He+Kr.  The
former is obviously due to secondary scintillations in
He  discussed  above.  The  latter  means  that  the
scintillation of He specie is quenched, in presence of
Kr, and that the avalanche is saturated. The avalanche
saturation at these relatively low  gains  might be  due
to  the  effect  of  avalanche  confinement  within  the
GEM hole considered in [11].

Optimization  of  GEM  hole  diameter/pitch  values
for high pressure operation was one of the goal of the
current 
gain-voltage
characteristics  of  a  single  GEM  detector  in  He  and
Kr,  at  5  atm,  for  three  different  configurations:
80/140,  40/140  and  40/100  m m.    One  can  see  that
decreasing GEM hole diameter does not improve the
operation at high pressures. In terms of the maximum
gain,  the  best  configuration  turned  out  to  be  the
“standard” one: 80/140 m m.

The other goal of the current work was to reach as
high  as  possible  operation  pressures  in  Kr  and  Xe,
which  is  relevant  in  the  field  of  X-ray  detection.  So
far,  it  did  not  exceed  5  atm  in  triple-GEM  detectors
[7],  because  the  voltage  applied  across  each  GEM
could  not  exceed  a  certain  value,  namely  700  V  in
heavy  noble  gases.    This  was  explained  by  ion
feedback  between  GEM  elements,  resulting  in  ion-
induced  electron  emission  from  the  GEM  electrode
[2]. Such an emission is particular enhanced in noble

detectors,  at  higher  pressures,  in  other  non-ageing
gases, are on the way.

example  by  operating  with  a  single  GEM  detector
rather than with that of multi-GEM, one might expect
reaching  higher  operation  pressures.  This  turned  out
to  be  the  case  as  one  can  see  from  Fig.4:  it  shows
gain-voltage characteristics of a single GEM detector
in  Kr  at  different  pressures.  Indeed,  here 
the
maximum  operation  pressure  and  voltage  exceed  10
atm  and  1200  V,  respectively,  the  maximum  gain
having a moderate value, of the order of 102, even at
10 atm.

In  He,  avalanche-induced  secondary  scintillations
are  observed  at  high  gains,  using 
the  Cu
photocathode.  This  observation  might  open  the  way
for  developing  He-based  gas  scintillation  detectors,
using a large variety of efficient photocathodes stable
in  air  (metals,  oxides,  etc).  The  apparent  application
of  He-based  detectors  in  general  is  a  non-ageing
neutron detector in compressed He3.

We  also  studied  the  effect  of  the  GEM  hole
diameter  and  pitch  and  the  number  of  GEMs  on  the
performance  at  high  pressures.  It  is  possible  to  have
moderate  gains  (~100)  at  rather  high  pressures  (10
atm)  in  heavy  noble  gases  if  to  do  without  ion
feedback between GEM elements, namely to operate
with  a  single  GEM  detector,  with  a  larger  hole
diameter.  This  result  may  be  attractive  for  X-ray
detectors in compressed Xe and Kr.

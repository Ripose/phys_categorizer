STRONG RF FOCUSING FOR LUMINOSITY INCREASE:
SHORT BUNCHES AT THE IP

A. Gallo, P. Raimondi, M. Zobov, INFN - LNF

Abstract

One of the key-issues to increase the luminosity in the
next  generation  particle  factories  is  to  reduce  the  bunch
length  at  the  interaction  point  (IP)  as  much  as  possible.
This  will  allow  reducing  proportionally  the  transverse
beta functions at the IP and increasing the luminosity by
the  same  factor.  The  strong  RF  focusing  consists  in
obtaining  short  bunches  by  substantially  increasing  the
lattice momentum compaction and the RF gradient. In this
regime the bunch length is modulated along the ring and
could  be  minimized  at  the  IP. If the principal impedance
generating  elements  of  the  ring  are  located  where  the
bunch is long (in the RF cavities region) it is possible to
avoid  microwave  instability  and  excessive  bunch
lengthening due to the potential well distortion.

1. INTRODUCTION

The minimum value of the vertical beta-function 

yβ  at
the IP in a collider is set by the hourglass effect [1] and it
is almost equal to the bunch length 
zσ . Reduction of the
bunch  length  is  an  obvious  approach  to  increase  the
luminosity.  By  scaling  the  horizontal  and  vertical  beta
functions 
zσ ,
yx,ξ   remain  unchanged
the  linear  tune  shift  parameters

while the luminosity scales as 

yβ  at the IP as the bunch length

A  natural  way  to  decrease  the  bunch  length  is  to
decrease  the  storage  ring  momentum  compaction  and/or
to  increase  the  RF  voltage.  However,  in  such  a  way  we
cannot  obtain  very  short  bunches  since  the  short-range
wakefields  prevent  this  because  of  the  potential  well
distortion and microwave instability.

In this paper we consider an alternative strategy to get
short  bunches  at  the  IP.  In  particular,  we  propose  to  use
strong  RF  focusing  [3]  (i.e.  high  RF  voltage  and  high
momentum  compaction)  to  obtain  very  short  bunches  at
the  IP  with  progressive  bunch  elongation  toward  the  RF
cavity.

With respect to the case of short bunches with constant
length  all  along  the  ring,  the  situation  seems  more
comfortable since the average charge density driving the
Touschek  scattering  is  smaller.  Besides,  this  allows
placing the most important impedance generating devices
near  the  RF  cavity  where  the  bunch  is  longest  thus
minimizing the effect of the wakefields.

2. STRONG RF FOCUSING

In order to compress the bunch at the IP in a collider a
strong RF focusing can be applied. For this purpose high
values  of  the  momentum  compaction  factor 
extremely high values of the RF gradient are required. It
is estimated that, for a Φ-factory  collider,  an  RF  voltage
RFV  of the order of 10 MV is necessary provided that the
cα  value is of the order of 0.2.

cα   and

Under these conditions the synchrotron tune 

sν   grows
to values larger than 0.1 and the commonly used "smooth
approximation"  in  the  analysis  of  the  longitudinal
dynamics  is  no  longer  valid.  Instead,  the  longitudinal
dynamics is much more similar to the transverse one, and
can  be  analyzed  on  the  base  of  transfer  matrices  of  the
simple  linear  model  reported  in  Fig. 1.  In  this  model  the
cavity behaves like a thin focusing lens in the longitudinal
phase space, while the rest of the machine is a drift space,

As  µ   approaches 

°180 ,  the  ratio  between  the  bunch
lengths at the IP and at the RF goes to zero. This result is
of great interest since it allows designing a ring where the
bunch  is  short  at  the  IP  and  progressively  elongates
moving toward the RF position.

3. EQUILIBRIUM ENERGY SPREAD
In  order  to  compute  exactly  the  bunch  size  along  the
ring  one  needs  to  know  the  longitudinal  emittance  value
(or,  equivalently,  the  value  of  the  equilibrium  energy
spread). These values can be worked out from a rigorous
analysis  of  the  longitudinal  dynamics  (abandoning  the

smooth  approximation)  or  from  a  multi-particle  tracking
simulation  including  the  distributed  emission  process
along  the  machine.  We  follow  an  analytical  approach
based  on  the  computation  of  the  second  momenta  of  the
bunch equilibrium distributions using the eigenvectors of
the longitudinal one-turn transfer matrix [4] that gives the
following result:

As  it  is  seen,  the  longitudinal  emittance  exhibits  a
minimum  at 
.  The  analogy  with  the  transverse
case  is  quite  evident  [6].  Being  the  momentum

compaction fixed, the various phase advances correspond
to  different  values  of  the  RF  voltages.  The  voltage
required  to  approach  the  limit  phase  advance  value  of
°180 exceeds 10 MV. The use of superconducting cavities
is mandatory in this case.

4. RF ACCEPTANCE
In  a  storage  ring  the  RF  acceptance  is  defined  as  the
maximum  energy  deviation  corresponding  to  a  stable
particle  trajectory  in  the  longitudinal  phase  space.  The
trajectory associated to the maximum energy deviation is
the  so-called  “separatrix”  since  it  separates  the  stable
(closed)  to  the  unstable  (open)  trajectories  in  the
longitudinal phase space.
In  a  standard,  low 

sν   storage  ring  the  longitudinal
phase space trajectories are independent on the particular
observation abscissa  s .  The  RF  acceptance  is  computed
as the separatrix half-height [5].

In  the  strong  RF  focusing  case,  the  longitudinal  phase
space  trajectories  configuration  changes  along  the  ring,
and the same does the separatrix, as shown in Figure 4.

In order to compute the particle loss rate caused by the
Touschek  scattering  process,  the  relevant  RF  acceptance
is the half-heigth of the separatrix section at 
, which
is  a  function  of  the  azimuth  s   in  this  case.  In  fact,  the
maximum  acceptable  energy  variation  for  a  particle
starting  from  about  the  origin  of  the  phase  space  is
smaller  in  the  RF  cavity  region  (where  the  bunch  is
longer);  this  must  be  taken  into  account  in  lifetime
evaluations.

bunch  current  value.  This  is  a  critical  point,  since  the
effect of the machine wakefields is strongly dependent on
the bunch length. In the case of pure inductive impedance,
for  example,  the  wake  potential  scales  as 
zσ .  On  the
other hand, the strong RF focusing produces a modulation
of  the  bunch  length  along  the  machine.  To  minimize  the
bunch  lengthening  effect  it  is  worth  to  design  a  storage
ring  with  all  the  most  dangerous  impedance  generating
components  (such  as  injection  kickers,  longitudinal  and
transverse kickers of the fast feedback systems, monitors
and  striplines,  …)  placed  where  the  bunch  is  longer,  i.e.
near the RF cavity section.

To estimate the criticality of the impedance location we
have  performed  multi-particle  tracking  simulation  of  a
bunch  in  the  strong  RF  focusing  regime  using  the
DAΦNE wake (see, for example, [7]) in the two extreme
(and  unrealistic)  cases  of  impedance  completely  concen-
tred near the RF or near the IP.

In  the  first  case  the  simulation  results,  reported  in
Fig.  5,  show  that  with  the  chosen  parameters  (
cα = -.17,
µ =165°,  3  1010  particles  ≡ 
bI =15  mA)  the  bunch  is
about  3  mm  long  at  the  IP,  and  11  mm  long  at  the  RF
location,  with  no  significant  degradation  with  respect  to
the bunch length at zero current.

Figure 4: Separatrices in a strong focusing storage ring

Concerning  the  loss  rate  caused  by  statistical  fluc-
tuations  of  the  particle  energy  deviation  (quantum  life-
time) the relevant parameter is the separatrix area, which
is independent on the azimuth  s  as a consequence of the
Liouville theorem.

5. BUNCH LENGTHENING
In  a  collider  based  on  the  strong  RF  focusing  concept
the  bunch  at  the  IP  has  to  remain  short  up  to  the  design

Figure 5: Particle distribution at RF and IP position in the
case of a wake located near the RF section

In the second case, where the wake is concentred near
the IP, the results of the tracking simulations are reported
in  Figure  6  and  show  a  strongly  deformed  bunch  profile
as a consequence of a microwave instability.

Figure 6: Particle distribution at RF position in the case of
a wake located near the IP section

We  have  also  considered  the  case  of  positive
momentum compaction (
cα = +0.17) and wake concentred
near the RF. The simulations show that the bunch is stable
with a very moderate lengthening.

6. CONCLUSIONS
In  this  paper  the  motion  of  particles  in  a  strong
longitudinal  focusing  storage  ring  is  described  by  means
of  the  linear  matrices  formalism.  Longitudinal  optical
functions  are  derived,  showing  that  the  bunch  length
varies along the ring and may be minimized at the IP.

Analytical  expressions  for  the  longitudinal  emittance
and  the  energy  spread  of  the  bunch  equilibrium
distribution  have  been  obtained  and  validated  by
comparison  with  results  from  multiparticle  tracking
simulations.  It  has  been  shown  that  the  longitudinal
emittance  and  the  energy  spread,  as  well  as  the  bunch
length  at  the  RF  cavity  position  diverge  as  the
synchrotron  phase  advance  approaches  180°  per  turn,
while the bunch length at the IP tends to a minimum value
which is finite.

Many  aspects  of  beam  physics  need  to  be  studied  to
establish whether or not a collider may efficiently work in
the  strong  longitudinal  focusing  regime.  The  most
relevant  issues  are  bunch  lengthening  due  to  the
wakefields,  Touschek  lifetime,  dynamic  aperture  and
beam-beam  effect.  Very  preliminary  multiparticle
tracking  simulations  based  on  the  DAΦNE  short  range
wake  show  that  the  short  bunch  length  at  the  IP  can  be

preserved  up  to  relatively  high  bunch  current  (> 10 mA)
provided  that  all  the  wake  is  concentrated  near  the  RF
cavity, the position where the bunch is longest.

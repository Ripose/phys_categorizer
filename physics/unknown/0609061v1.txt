Abstract 

Here we discuss the theory and analyze in detail the guidance properties of linear 

arrays  of  metamaterial/plasmonic  small  particles  as  nano-scale  optical 

nanotransmission  lines,  including  the  effect  of  material  loss.  Under  the 

assumption  of  dipolar  approximation  for  each  particle,  which  is  shown  to  be 

accurate  in  the  geometry  of  interest  here,  we  develop  closed-form  analytical 

expressions for the eigen-modal dispersion in such arrays. With the material loss 

included,  the  conditions  for  minimal  absorption  and  maximum  bandwidth  are 

derived  analytically  by  studying  the  properties  of  such  dispersion  relations.  

Numerical examples with realistic materials including their ohmic absorption and 

frequency dispersion are presented. The analytical properties discussed here also 

provide  some  further  physical  insights  into  the  mechanisms  underlying  the  sub-

diffraction  guidance  in  such  arrays  and  their  fundamental  physical  limits. 

Possibility  of  guiding  beams  with  sub-wavelength  lateral  confinement  and 

reasonably  low  decay  is  discussed  offering  the  possible  use  of  this  technique  at 

microwave,  infrared  and  optical  frequencies.  Interpretation  of  these  results  in

terms of nanocircuit concepts is presented, and possible extension to 2-D and 3-D 

nanotrasnsmission line optical metamaterials is also foreseen.

Introduction 

 

One  of  the  main  technological  challenges  of  today  deals  with  squeezing  the 

dimensions of electronic components and/or raising their frequency of operation 

in  order  to  have  more  compact  and  faster  communications  and  computational 

abilities.  For  these  purposes,  the  interest  in  designing  efficient,  sub-wavelength 

guiding structures at optical frequencies has increased in recent years. As is well 

known,  the  material  conduction  at  infrared  and  higher  frequencies  changes  its 

usual  properties  [1]  that  are  widely  exploited  in  microwaves,  and  the  guiding 

mechanisms relying on the total reflection at a highly conducting boundary are no 

longer easily possible at these high frequency regimes.  

An  interesting  alternative,  however,  may  be  found  in  the  plasmonic  resonances 

(see,  e.g., 

[2]-[3]), 

typical  of  noble  metals,  polar  dielectrics,  certain 

semiconductors  [4],  and  metamaterials,  that  arise  when  these  materials  are 

interfaced with conventional media [5]. The negative real part of permittivity of 

plasmonic  materials  at  THz,  infrared  and  optical  frequencies,  combined  with 

reasonably 

low 

losses, 

is 

indeed 

responsible 

for 

several  anomalous 

electromagnetic properties, which have been studied since the initial development 

of the electromagnetic theory [6]. It is well known, for instance, how an isolated 

plasmonic  particle  can  support  a  sub-wavelength  “quasi-static  resonance”  (i.e., 

 

-2- 

local surface plasmon resonance), under suitable conditions on its geometrical and 

electromagnetic parameters. 

As for applications of such resonances to the problem of guiding of waves at these 

high  frequencies,  chains  of  such  plasmonic  particles  have  been  proposed  as 

possible sub-diffractive waveguides in the infrared and optical regime, since the 

coupling among the individual resonances of each nanoparticle may guide a beam 

with  sub-wavelength  lateral  confinement  and  reasonably  low  attenuation  factor 

[7]-[28].  Under  suitable  conditions,  it  has  been  shown  theoretically  and 

experimentally by various groups how these arrays may guide the energy with a 

modal cross section smaller than the free-space wavelength and for a reasonable 

distance.  In  many  cases  reported  in  the  literature,  however,  the  theoretical 

analyses  have  been  conducted  in  the  “quasi-static  limit”  and/or  for  arrays  under 

some relevant approximations. Moreover, due to convergence problems relatively 

less  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  influence  of  material  losses  and  frequency 

dispersion  of  the  modes  guided  by  these  structures  –  aspects  that  we  fully 

consider in the present paper. Such anomalous guidance along plasmonic particle 

arrays  has  been  extensively  simulated  numerically  or  proven  experimentally  by 

various groups.  It  is  of  great interest to highlight a proper full-wave theoretical 

interpretation  of  the  results,  particularly  the  role  of  material  loss  on  modal 

dispersion. 

Our group has been interested in exploring the theoretical conditions under which 

this  technique  may  be  successfully  utilized  in  the  case  of  arrays  of  resonant, 

naturally  plasmonic  or  artificially-made  metamaterial  nanoparticles,  and  to 

 

-3- 

investigate  in  more  details  the  properties  of  such  guidance  with  respect  to  the 

parameters involved in this phenomenon [27]-[28], including the loss mechanism. 

Why more analysis for such a problem? The goal of this work is to fully review 

the  guiding  characteristics  of  an  infinite  array  of  particles  from  a  general  full-

wave  analytical  point  of  view  (even  including  material  loss),  under  the  only 

assumption  of  the  dipolar  contribution  of  each  particle  to  the  interaction  among 

the particles, which, as we show in the following, is necessary for the guidance of 

low-attenuating beams. In this case we are able to find the fundamental physical 

limits of this phenomenon that would allow us to predict the general behavior of 

electromagnetic  interaction  among  these  particles  and  to  obtain  further  physical 

insights. In particular, this general closed-form dispersion relation for the modes 

in this setup may provide us with interesting conditions on the required properties 

for  minimal  absorption  or  radiation  damping  and  better  robustness  or  higher 

bandwidth  for  these  waveguides.  The  results  obtained  here  may  therefore  offer 

some  fundamental  lower  limits  on  the  guidance  properties  of  such  plasmonic 

The paper is organized as follows: in the next section the general conditions and 

properties  of  the  guidance  of  sub-diffraction  beams  along  plasmonic  arrays  are 

derived  assuming  a  generic  model  for  the  polarizability  of  each  particle 

composing the chain. In the following section, these theoretical results are applied 

to  realistic  plasmonic  particles,  analyzing  also  some  numerical  examples  that 

confirm  the  theory  presented  here  and  providing  physical  interpretation  of  these 

arrays.

Modal properties of chains of polarizable particles 

In the limit in which a sub-wavelength low-loss nanoparticle is close to its dipolar 

resonance,  its  near  field  as  well  as  its  far  field  is  strongly  dominated  by  the 

corresponding dipolar contribution. In this case, the particle’s presence, as seen by 

an  observer  placed  anywhere  outside  its  volume,  may  be  interpreted  as  a 

corresponding  dipole  of  amplitude 

p

eeα=

E ,  where 

0

0E   is  the  averaged  local 

external electric field applied on the particle  (which  may  be  considered  uniform 

due  to  the  small  electrical  extent  of  the  particle  volume)  and 

eeα   is  its  electric 

polarizability,  here  considered  to  be  isotropic  for  sake  of  simplicity1.  In  the 

following, we assume the particles to operate sufficiently close to the resonance 

of their electric dipole moment, and thus we can safely consider each particle to 

be represented by  p , bearing in mind that for plasmonic particles with a negative 

real  part  of  their  permittivity  this  situation  is  not  uncommon  [2].  An  analogous 

situation  is  found  when  magnetic  dipoles  or  metamaterial  particles  that  may 

support  electric  and/or  magnetic  resonances  [29]  are  considered,  and  therefore 

analogous  analyses  may  be  conducted  in  such  cases.  The  case  in  which  both 

magnetic  and  electric  resonances  are  excited  simultaneously  in  a  chain  problem 

                                                 
1 The case of anisotropic particles may follow the same theoretical analysis presented here as long 
as  the  polarization  of  the  field  on  each  particle  is  aligned  with  one  of  the  principal  axes  of 
anisotropy. This is often the case when non-symmetric geometries are considered, like nano-wires 
or short dipoles. A generalization of this analysis to arbitrary anisotropy of the particles is beyond 
the scope of this manuscript.

has  been  investigated  in  [24].  In  the  following,  without  loss  of  generality  we 

concentrate on the electric case. 

Although it is well known that the far field from a sub-wavelength particle is well 

described  by  this  dipolar  approximation  [2]-[3],  it  should  be  noted  that  the 

assumption  that  the  particle  is  near  its  dipolar  resonance,  corresponding  to  the 

condition  for  its  polarizability  to  fulfill 

Re

1

eeα−⎡
⎣

⎤
⎦ (cid:17) ,  ensures  that  even  its  near 

0

field  is  dominated  by  this  dipolar  term2.  This  implies  that  when  considering  the 

mutual  interaction  among  particles  near  their  dipolar  resonance,  as  is  the  case 

here, it is sufficient to consider their dipolar term even when their center-to-center 

distance  is  very  small.  As  we  show  in  the  following,  this  requirement  of  being 

sufficiently  close  to  their  resonances  is  necessary  for  the  guidance  of  low-

attenuating  modes,  and  therefore  the  assumption  that  the  dipolar  contribution 

dominates is not restrictive in the following analysis. 

a) Polarizability of an isolated particle 

The  electric  polarizability  of  a  generic  isolated  particle  may  be  expressed  in  the 

following closed form in terms of its Mie scattering coefficient  1

dipolar  field  distribution  is  dominant  over  any  other  non-resonant  higher-order  multipole 
contribution.

consistent with the radiation condition [3] and with the power conservation issues 

[8].  The  shape  of  the  particle,  on  the  other  hand,  affects  the  real  part  of  this

b) Modal dispersion for a linear chain of polarizable particles 

Consider now the case of an infinite array of such polarizable dipoles, as depicted 

in  Fig.  1,  located  along  the  x   axis  at  the  location  x N d

=

  with  N   being  any 

positive or negative integer. Let 

Np  be the dipole moment for the  N th particle. 

Suppose now that the particle at 

x =  is excited with a given linearly polarized 

0

electric field inducing the dipole moment 

0p . Due to the linearity of the problem 

and the symmetry around the  x  axis, without loss of generality we may split the 

problem into the two cases of longitudinal excitation, for which

can be easily verified, due to the electric field distribution of the dipolar pattern,

In the fully dynamic case the dispersion relations for these modes may be found 

by  supposing  that  such  a  modal  distribution  is  somehow  established  along  the 

chain and by imposing that the electric field induced at the location

already done in [8], [13], [20], [22]-[28]. In our notation this may be written in the 

following convenient form for the two polarizations: 

                                                 
3 Notice that for a generic orientation of 
0p  the dipole moments induced on the other particles are 
not necessarily oriented in the direction parallel to 
0p . It is therefore convenient without loss of 
generality  to  decompose  the  problem  in  these  two  fundamental  polarizations,  which  support 
linearly  polarized  propagation  along  the  chain.  Arbitrary  polarization  of  the  guided  modes  is 
considered as a special case in the next section.

.  In  this  way  all  the  quantities 

involved in Eq. (4) are dimensionless and the system is frequency invariant. We 

notice how the dispersion equations are even with β, as expected, and periodic in 

β with principal period 

−
π

/

d

, due to the inherent periodicity of the 

Floquet modes of the chain.  

The  problem  has  been  elegantly  reduced  in  (4)  to  two  dispersion  equations 

involving  three  quantities:  the  normalized  spacing  d ,  related  to  the  geometrical 

properties  of  the  chain,  the  normalized  inverse  polarizability 

eeα ,  related  to  the 

particle  properties,  and  the  normalized  guided  wave  number  β ,  which  is  the 

unknown of the problem and the quantity of interest. 

For  the  two  polarizations  Eq.  (4)  is  a  complex  equation,  with  the  complication 

that  the  series  on  the  left-hand  side  are  slowly  convergent  with  N .  Moreover, 

these summations diverge for complex solutions of  β, as noticed in [20]. This is 

because  strictly  speaking  the  supported  complex  mode  would  be  growing 

exponentially at  +∞  or  −∞ , depending on the chosen sign of  β , in a way faster 

than the decay of the dipolar fields. Clearly this problem is not present when the 

chain is fed at a finite  x , as in any physically realizable system, but it arises under 

the  hypothesis  of  a  modal  distribution  established  at  infinity.  This  divergence 

problem might explain why in the technical literature less attention has been paid 

 

-10- 

to  the  theoretical  full-wave  analysis  of  the  behavior  of  such  eigenmodes 

propagating along infinite chains of plasmonic particles when material losses are 

considered or when the modes radiate in the background medium, for which case 

the solutions for β  would necessarily be complex. 

This problem can be overcome by regularizing (4). This is done by supposing that 

the  dispersion  equations  admit  real  solutions,  and  then  applying  an  analytical 

continuation  in  the  complex  plane.  In  this  case,  it  is  convenient  to  rewrite  the 

equations in terms of polylogarithm functions

In this way the dispersion relations (5) are convergent for real and complex values 

of  β  and,  due  to  their  numerous  analytical  and  recursive  properties,  their 

evaluation is very efficient and it can be performed instantaneously with standard 

mathematical software (e.g., [31]). This eliminates any problem in the evaluation 

of real and complex poles for the supported modes of the chain, and it represents a 

 

-11- 

complete  general  expression  for  the  problem  at  hand.  The  use  of  polylogarithm 

functions  for  expressing,  in  closed  form,  the  dispersion  of  guided  modes  along 

such linear chains has also been proposed in recent contributions [25]-[26]. 

It is interesting to underline that formulation (5) is valid for any complex value of 

the  parameters  coming  into  play  (i.e.,  when  material  losses  are  introduced  or 

when  leaky  radiating  modes  are  studied).  The  properties  of  polylogarithms  and 

associated  functions  may  help  in  understanding  the  intrinsic  properties  of  this 

configuration  (including  the  material  loss)  when  utilized  to  guide  as  well  as  to 

radiate energy, as we show in the following. 

It  may  also  be  noted  that  the  analytical  continuation  introduced  here,  which 

allows  avoiding  the  divergence  problem  present  in  (4),  may  yield  complex 

solutions that are not strictly physical, in the sense that they may diverge at  ±∞ . 

In  real  systems,  since  the  structure  is  finite  and  fed  at  a  specific  point,  this 

problem does not constitute an issue, and the validity of such solutions follows the 

same  mathematical  discussion  justifying  improper  leaky-wave  solutions  in  any 

guiding  structure,  or  low-attenuating  modes  in  lossy  waveguides  [32]:  they 

dominate  the  steepest-descent  approximation  in  specific  angular  regions  of  the 

visible  spectrum  and,  even  if  not  representing  proper  physical  solutions  for  the 

modes  of  the  structure,  they  constitute  effective  descriptions  of  the  near-field 

distribution  at  their  resonance.  We  do  not  discuss  further  this  point,  since  it  has 

been  widely  discussed  in  the  technical  literature  (see,  e.g.,  [32]).  It  should  be 

noted,  however,  that  limiting  this  formulation  to  the  case  of  real  β,  Eq.  (5)  is 

 

-12- 

consistent with (4), with the accelerated series expression derived in [33] or with 

the approximated closed-form solution of this series reported in [22]-[24].  

c) Analytical properties of the dispersion equations 

Let us consider now the case of interest here, i.e., a transparent background with 

0k ∈ (cid:92)   (the  cases  of  a  lossy  and/or  ε-negative  background  are  also  part  of  the 

analysis of the previous paragraph, but they will be analyzed elsewhere). In this 

case, real solutions of  β  for Eqs. (4)-(5) would correspond to propagating modes 

along  the  chain  that  do  not  radiate  energy  and  do  not  decay.  By  extracting  the 

imaginary  part  of  Eq.  (5)  under  the  hypothesis  of  β   being  a  real  quantity,  and

Eq. (7) represents an interesting result, consistent with what is found in [8] for the 

longitudinal polarization. These closed form expressions in fact ensure the power 

conservation issue: when 

1β >  the guided mode is a slow wave, implying that 

the interference of the dipolar fields of each particle is destructive at any visible 

angle  in  the  far  zone,  leading  to  the  propagation  of  a  (non-radiating)  guided 

surface wave along the chain. At a sufficient distance from the chain, for which 

only the dominant first-order Bloch mode comes into play (the higher-order Bloch 

modes are all evanescent in this situation), the field distribution may be evaluated 

by  assuming  the  presence  of  an  averaged  current  line  along  the  x   axis  with

requirement  (3)  for  lossless  particles.  Physically,  guided  modes  may  indeed  be 

supported  by  a  lossless  structure  provided  that  their 

0kβ >

,  in  order  to  ensure 

that the mode does not radiate power in free space and neither suffers of material 

absorption.  This  concept  is  elegantly  summarized  in  Eq.  (7)  for  the  two 

polarizations.  

This  situation,  which  is  of  interest  for  the  present  paper,  is  possible  only  for 

d π< , as clearly seen from the condition of validity of (7) that is 

β π<

/ d

. This 

condition on the spacing between the particles, for which 

d λ<

0 / 2

, represents a 

first fundamental limit for the guiding properties of such dipole chains. We note 

also that the guided beam is weakly guided for chains with spacing factor close to 

this  limit,  since  when  d π(cid:17)   the  guided  modes  have  necessarily 

1β (cid:17) ,  which 

implies a mode not really confined near the particles, as shown by Eq. (8). This 

implies that a good guidance is possible only for particles sufficiently packed, and 

β π<

/ d

 represents quantitatively this limit on the geometry of the chain. 

When 

1β < , on the other hand, a positive term is added to the right hand side of 

the equations in (7). In this case, in fact, the interference of the dipolar patterns 

may  add  up  constructively,  producing  a  leaky-wave  mode.  The  positive  term 

added  to  the  right  hand  side  of  (7)  may  be  justified  equating  the  averaged  real 

power  radiated  by  each  particle  (which  is  non  zero  only  when 

1β < )  to  the 

power extracted by each dipole, as shown for the longitudinal case in [8].  

In  the  two  polarizations,  working  in  the  far  field  where  we  can  simplify  the 

problem by assuming again the presence of a current line of averaged amplitude

which is valid only when 

0kβ<

 (as already mentioned the radiated power is zero 

for 

0kβ>

). After the due normalizations, the imaginary part of the left-hand side 

of  (5)  takes  exactly  into  account  this  radiated  power,  adding  accordingly  the 

positive term on the right-hand side of Eq. (7) in this leaky-wave regime. Eq. (7), 

therefore,  also  describes  analytically  the  radiation  properties  of  such  chains  in 

their leaky-wave modal operation. 

For having real solutions for  β  in this case, Eq. (7) requires the use of particles 

(and/or  the  host)  with  active  (i.e.,  gain)  materials,  whose  polarizability 

compensates for the radiation losses evaluated in (9). In this case the chain would 

of  course  act  as  a  nano-leaky-wave  antenna,  rather  than  as  a  waveguide,  which 

may have different interesting applications, not discussed in the present paper.  

It  should  be  noted  that  for  the  longitudinal  case  Eq.  (7)-(9)  have  a  smooth 

transition  at 

1β = ,  but  in  the  transverse  polarization  there  is  a  discontinuity 

between the two intervals. As we show in the following, the dispersion features in 

the two polarizations are in fact different, and only the longitudinal case allows a 

continuous transition from the surface-wave propagation to the leaky-wave mode 

of operation. This is again reflected in the properties of Eq. (7).

This  represents  the  closed-form  expression,  as  a  general  result,  for  the  range  of 

polarizabilities  capable  of  supporting  guided  longitudinal  modes  in  a  chain  of 

lossless  polarizable  particles  with  a  given  spacing.  In  other  words,  seeking  for 

guided  modes  in  longitudinal  linear  polarization,  the  particles  composing  the 

chain should be designed to have the proper inverse polarizability falling in this 

range, depending on the particle separation. 

Fig. 2 reports this guidance region in the plot of  d  versus

The region below the black line, in which the phases of two neighboring particles 

are  opposite  to  each  other  and  the  mode  is  therefore  non-radiating,  rapidly 

 

 

-18- 

attenuated  and  totally  reflected  at  the  entrance  of  the  chain,  represents  the  stop-

band  region  of  this  configuration.  It  should  be  noted  how  the  stop-band  for  this 

chain may arise at frequencies for which its periodicity is much smaller than the 

background  wavelength 

0λ .  Usually  band-gap  structures  are  characterized  by  a 

periodicity  of  the  order  of 

0 / 2λ ,  for  which  Bragg  reflection  arises  (see,  e.g., 

[36]). The condition for entering the stop-band region in this case, instead, is that 

the  chain  spacing  is 

/ 2gλ ,  which 

2 /
gλ π β

=

  is  much  smaller  than 

0λ   for 

sufficiently packed particles. This implies that a sub-wavelength plasmonic chain 

may  support  a  first  band-gap  in  the  long-wavelength  regime,  due  to  the 

anomalous  slow-wave  mode  supported  by  such  chains.  This  phenomenon  is  not 

discussed  further  in  the  present  paper  and  it  will  be  the  subject  of  future 

investigations for some other interesting potential applications. 

In  the  region  between  the  two  lines,  longitudinal  guided  modes  with  no 

attenuation (in the limit of no losses we are considering now) are supported, with 

β   monotonically  increasing  with  a  decrease  of

You may notice how for small  d  the guidance region rapidly widens up (a factor 

of 

3d  is also normalizing the vertical axis), being centered around the resonance 

condition for the isolated particle 

Re

. In any case, for a guided mode to 

1

eeα−⎡
⎣

⎤ =

be supported the requirement of particles near their resonance remains necessary, 

and  it  is  physically  understandable  since  non-resonant  nanoparticles  offer  weak 

induced dipole moments and low scattering, and therefore their interaction in the 

chain would not be sufficient to self sustain a propagating mode. As more widely

each particle necessarily narrows down as (

0k a −  [37], with  a  being its averaged

linear dimension. These two factors compensate each other, as it is discussed in 

the next section. 

The transition between the surface-wave and leaky-wave operations is smooth for 

this polarization: increasing the particle inverse polarizability, the mode becomes 

weakly guided and at some point starts radiating energy away, scanning the beam

angle  with  a  variation  of  Re β⎡

⎣

⎣

When  the  distance  between  particles  is  increased,  the  required  polarizability  of 

each  particle  in  the  chain  for  having  a  guided  mode  narrows  down  in  a  smaller 

range  around  the  resonance,  since the particles are required  to  be  closer  to  their 

individual  resonance  to  support  a  guided  mode.  However,  the  presence  of  the 

other scatterers shifts the resonance condition, and the guidance region for a given 

d  is not necessarily centered around 

Re

⎣

longitudinal  mode  with  real  β.  In  this  case,  the  proper  condition  on  the 

polarizability  requires  it  to  be  tuned  downwards  or  upwards  in  the  plot.  When 

d π→   the  range  of  required  polarizabilities  tends  to  a  single  specific  value

polarizability for an infinite chain of lossless particles with spacing

 in 

order  to  support  a  resonance.  For  distances  beyond  this  value  no  resonance  (or 

guided waves) can be supported by such an array, consistently with the results of 

the previous paragraph.  

Curves for different values of β are also reported in the plot. The region included 

between the green dotted line and the solid black line, for instance, are those for 

which 

3β > . This makes it clear that a more negative inverse polarizability in the 

region  of  guidance  confines  more  the  guided  beam  around  the  chain.  Similar 

curves are plotted for 

2β =  and 

1.5β =

, also showing the narrower limits in the 

spacing between the particles to support a beam concentrated around the chain. 

Figure 2 – Regions of guidance for the longitudinal mode (Fig. 1a). Above the red-dashed line, a 

longitudinal leaky-mode exists, whereas below the black solid line we enter the band-gap region 

of  the  chain  in  this  polarization.  For  values  of  polarizabilities  between  the  two  lines  guided

of   β, and therefore more confined modes. 

 

Figure  3  reports  the  dispersion  diagram  for  the  real  β   versus 

Re

eeα−⎡
⎣

⎦   for  the 

longitudinal  modes  guided  by  an  infinite  array  of  lossless  particles  in  the  two 

significant  cases  of  narrow  spacing  (

d =

0.1

,  Fig.  3a)  and  wide  spacing 

(

d

0.9
π=

,  Fig.  3b).  The  plots  are  compared  with  the  nearest  neighbor 

approximation  (NNA),  i.e.,  the  approximate  solution  obtained  using  only  the 

quasi-static dipolar field of the nearest neighboring particle, that can be obtained 

from  Eq.  (4)  by  truncating  the  summation  to  the  first  term  and  neglecting  the 

imaginary  part  of  the  solution  (which  is  vanishing  for  small  d ).  This 

approximation has often been used in the technical literature (see e.g., [9]) for the 

analysis  of  this  setup.  In  the  plots  the  horizontal  axis  is  delimited  by  the 

boundaries for the particles polarizability derived from Fig. 2. You notice how in 

the case of narrow spacing (Fig. 3a)  β  may yield large values, limited by 

/ dπ , 

implying  that  a  sub-wavelength  confinement  of  the  mode  is  possible,  and  the 

NNA  predicts  the  dispersion  reasonably  well,  since  the  coupling  between 

neighboring  particles  dominates.  It  is  interesting  to  note  that  once  the  mode 

becomes  sufficiently  slow,  it  is  in  principle  possible  to  confine  the  beam  in  a 

region  of  space  much  smaller  than  the  wavelength  of  operation,  going  much 

beyond  the  diffraction  limit.  From  these  results  it  may  appear  that  there  is  no 

lower limit on how narrow the spacing between particles, and therefore the guided 

cross  section,  may  be  made  (the  guided  beam  cross  section  decays  with  an 

 

-22- 

increase  of  β,  following  (8)).  However,  this  property  is  limited  by  losses,  as  it 

will be shown in the following section.  

For  electrically  larger  spacing  (Fig.  3b),  on  the  other  hand,  the  NNA  yields 

incorrect  results.  Also, 

the  guidance 

is 

limited 

to  a  narrow  range  of 

polarizabilities, as predicted by Fig. 2 and the mode is poorly confined along the 

chain, since 

1β (cid:17) .  

It  is  interesting  to  note  how  for  particles  at  their  individual  resonance,  i.e., 

Re

1

eeα−⎡
⎣

⎤ =
⎦

0

, the NNA predicts the approximate solution 

dβ π=

/ 2

, with a cut-

off for the guided modes in this case to be at 

d π=

/ 2

, very near the exact value 

d =

1.71

  determined  in  our  earlier  discussion  about  Fig.  2.  The  discrepancy 

between the exact solution and the NNA is  more  accentuated  when  the  mode  is 

close to the borders of the guidance region, i.e., near the leaky-wave or the band-

gap regions.  

As a last comment on these plots, it is worth noting how, as predicted by (12), the 

slope  of  the  dispersion  curve  is  always  negative.  As  will  be  discussed  in  more 

details  later,  this  is  a  consequence  of  the  forward-wave  propagation  of  these 

longitudinal modes (i.e., phase and group velocities parallel to each other).

two  distinct  surface  modes 

in  a  given  range  of 

polarizabilities.  Taking  the  derivative  of  (10)  and  using  the  properties  of 

Clausen’s functions, it is possible to show that this coexistence of two modes is 

possible when

From a physical point of view, for this polarization the presence of the secondary

This  phenomenon  is  not  uncommon  when  dealing  with  guided  modes  in 

plasmonic  or  negative-index  structures,  as  we  have  found 

in  different 

configurations [41]-[44]. In this chain configuration this special solution has been 

investigated  theoretically  by  Simovski  et  al.  in  [45]-[46].  We  show  in  the 

                                                 
5 As an aside, a similar dual-mode of propagation is typical of spatially dispersive materials, e.g., 
the  wire  medium  [40].  The  3D  extension  of  this  chain  problem,  in  fact,  shows  a  spatially 
dispersive characteristic, as will be presented elsewhere in the near future.

following,  however,  how  the  presence  of  absorption  in  the  particles  affects 

particularly these regions of guidance for which the derivative

 is 

particularly  low,  reducing  the  effective  applicability  of  this  region  of  operation. 

Moreover,  when  losses  are  considered,  this  derivative,  and  consequently  the 

group  velocity  of  the  mode,  can  never  be  identically  zero,  even  though  it  may 

become sufficiently low for a low-absorptive material. 

Fig. 4 shows the admissible range of polarizabilities for having guided modes in 

this  polarization.  The  black  solid  line,  which  is  the  locus  for  which 

β π=

when 

d

d< , represents an upper boundary for the polarizability in order to have 

ˆ

the confined mode in the two-mode regime (with 

β

d

). Beyond this 

min

line, in fact, we enter the band-gap region for this confined mode, since its  β  is 

sufficiently  high  to  have 

d λ=

.  The  red  dashed  line,  on  the  other  hand, 

provides the value of polarizability that gives 

β β=

, i.e., it represents the value 

min

of 

1

minα−

 as a function of  d . Below the red line the two supported modes become 

complex conjugate of each other with  Re

. The red line represents the

dispersion curve for the zero-group velocity mode described in [45]-[46] and the 

value  of  its  guided  wave  number 

minβ   as  a  function  of  d   is  reported  in  Fig.  5, 

remaining close to unity in all the admissible range 

d

ˆ
d< .  

The  area  between  the  black  solid  and  red  dashed  line  is  therefore  the  required 

range for having a confined transverse guided wave propagating along the chain 

with  no  radiation.  The  green  dotted  line  continues  the  lower  limit  of 

 

-28- 

polarizabilities when 

d

d> , still being the locus for which 

β π=

/ d

. Below this 

ˆ

line again no mode can be guided by the chain. In the region above the green and 

the  back  lines,  however,  the  chain  still  in  principle  supports  one  guided  mode, 

even though its distribution is very sparse in the outer region. As an example, the 

blue dash-dotted line is the locus where this poorly confined mode has 

β =

1.001

. 

Clearly, above this line the chain is not guiding any wave, since its distribution is 

very widespread in the surrounding space. The inverse polarizabilities in fact are 

far from their individual resonances and therefore the guided mode is close to the 

TEM plane wave propagating in the background medium, weakly affected by the 

presence  of  the  chain.  Similar  to  the  longitudinal  case,  the  cyan  dash-dot-dotted 

line  is  the  locus  for 

3β = ,  and  the  region  between  it  and  the  black  solid  line 

includes  the  region  where 

3β > .  Contrary  to  the  previous  case,  here  a  more 

positive inverse polarizability within the region of guidance of the confined mode 

would  produce  a  higher  β   and  a  more  concentrated  beam.  This  is  due  to  the 

backwardness of the confined mode, as we will discuss later. Comparing the two 

polarizations, we note how the longitudinal and transverse modes have somewhat 

similar features for guidance, since the range of polarizabilities that would support 

a  guided  confined  beam,  forward  or  backward  depending  on  the  polarization,  is 

comparable in the two cases.

propagation of confined guided modes in the transverse polarization, as a function of  d  

 

 

To  provide  an  example  of  the  dispersion  for  this  transverse  configuration,  we 

have  considered  the  cases  reported  in  Fig.  6,  distinguishing  again  between  a 

narrow spacing (

d =

0.1

, Fig. 6a) and a wide spacing (

d

0.9
π=

, Fig. 6b). In the 

-30- 

first case, the propagation of a confined mode, similar to the longitudinal case, is 

shown to be possible. As predicted by (16), the slope of the curve in the confined 

region  is  opposite  with  respect  to  that  of  the  longitudinal  polarization,  a 

consequence of the change in the direction of power flow, since, as shown in the 

following,  this  mode  is  backward,  i.e.,  group  and  phase  velocities  are  anti-

parallel.  This  situation  is  possible  provided  that  condition  (15)  is  satisfied  for 

d

d< .  In  this  case  we  are  indeed  in  the  region  confined  between  the  red  and 

ˆ

black lines in the plot of Fig. 4 and a second mode is visible in the region 

1β += . 

Even  though  this  mode  has  in  principle  no  upper  limit  for  the  required 

polarizability  value,  its  propagation  properties  are  clearly  less  appealing,  being 

analogous  to  those  of  a  plane  wave  propagating  in  the  background  medium  and 

weakly  interacting  with  the  chain.  The  NNA  predicts  well  the  dispersion  of  the 

first mode, and it does not predict the second mode of propagation. We note the 

position  of  the  zero-group  velocity  mode  at  the  connection  between  the  two 

curves in the plot. 

For wider spacing, beyond the 2-mode region, i.e., for 

d

d> , the only supported 

ˆ

mode maintains a positive slope in the plot, similar to the longitudinal mode, and 

it  is  in  fact  a  forward-wave.  However,  there  is  still  no  upper  boundary  for  the 

inverse  polarizability  with  β,  that  rapidly  approaches  unity  when 

Re

1

eeα−⎡
⎣

⎤
⎦   is 

increased.  In  this  polarization,  the  NNA  again  fails  completely  when  a  wider 

spacing  is  considered  and  the  zero-group  velocity  mode  is  not  supported  in  this 

configuration.

f) Lossy particles 

We  recall  now  that  the  analytical  continuation  of  the  dispersion  relations 

represented by Eq. (5) also allows treating complex solutions of  β . This implies 

that  the  leaky-wave  complex  mode  regime  may  be  analyzed  following  similar 

steps, even though it is not of interest for the present analysis. It will be presented 

in a future work for different applications.

It is however of interest to consider complex solutions for  β  in the case in which 

small  ohmic  losses  are  added  to  the  particles  polarizability.  Under  this 

assumption,  which  brings  the  present  analysis  closer  to  a  realistic  model,  an 

attenuation  factor  in  the  propagation,  i.e.,  an  imaginary  part  of  β ,  is  expected. 

Eq.  (5)  in  this  case  would  indeed  support  complex  solutions,  and  Eq.  (4)  would 

not properly converge. In parallel, condition (7) for having real solutions cannot 

be satisfied even in the region  1

<

, since the presence of ohmic losses 

adds a contribution to the imaginary part of the inverse polarizability, in the form:

with 

rβ  satisfying the unperturbed Eq. (10).  

This  implies  that  the  attenuation  factor  of  the  guided  modes  (due  to  the  small 

material  losses  in  particles)  is  directly  proportional  to  the  contribution  of  ohmic 

losses  to  the  inverse  polarizability  and  to  the  derivative  of  the  guided  wave 

 

-33- 

number with respect to the inverse polarizability itself, which according to (17) is 

inversely  proportional  to  the  modal  group  velocity.  This  is  valid  in  both 

polarizations. The properties of Eq. (5) ensure that the perturbation of 

rβ  due to 

the  presence  of  material  losses  are  only  a  second-order  effect,  and  small  ohmic 

losses affect mainly the attenuation factor, inducing a 

iβ  proportional to 

1

lossα−

. 

As a corollary to (19), we can determine the direction of power flow in the modes 

previously  described.  In  fact,  the  regions  where

(positive) are the regions where the guided mode is forward (backward). This is 

because  under  the

rβ > ),  a 
0

positive  group  velocity  and  power  flow  (i.e.,  a  forward  propagation)  can  be 

expected only when 

iβ > , that is for a negative value of

happens  in  the  longitudinal  polarization  and  in  the  low-confined  propagation  of

,  as  it  is  for  the

backward,  again  following  (19)  and  applying  causality.  Moreover,  as  already 

anticipated,  the  regions  where

,  and  correspondingly  the  group

velocity, is small are those more affected by the presence of ohmic losses in the 

particles, and those for which the attenuation of the guided mode is expected to be 

higher for a given material loss factor. This should be considered in applications 

when  utilizing  these  chains  having  modes  with  very  low  (or  even  zero)  group 

velocity, as in [45]-[46], since material losses are expected to strongly affect these 

configurations. 

 

-34- 

Using (19), it becomes straightforward to identify the more appealing regions of 

dispersion curves for getting a low-attenuation propagation along the chain: first 

of  all,  the  sensitivity  to  losses  increases  when  the  spacing  d   is  increased,  as 

evident from the previous figures, since the derivative 

β
∂
r

/ Re
∂

1
α−⎡
⎣
ee

⎤
⎦  in general 

grows  with  d .  This  is  obviously  related  to  the  fact  that  more  particles  per  unit 

length are expected to guide better the energy along the chain. Also, the region of 

weak guidance for closely packed particles in the transverse polarization is very 

weakly  affected  by  losses  (the  derivative  is  almost  zero  for  such  a  modal 

operation),  due  to  the  fact  that  the  mode  is  very  widespread  around  the 

background space and weakly interacting with the lossy particles. Near the cut-off 

of  the  modes  the  derivative  becomes  high,  and  we  expect  higher  sensitivity  to 

losses when the propagating mode is entering a cut-off region. This is consistent 

with the properties of any traveling-wave structure. 

It is particularly interesting to apply this result in order to find the conditions of 

minimum absorption for the guided modes in the two polarizations, which may be 

useful for the design of low-attenuation waveguides and nanotransmission lines in 

this  configuration.  Based  on  the  above  discussion  and  following  (19),  these 

conditions  are  those  for  which  the  second  derivative

Resorting again to the properties of Clausen’s functions (11) and conducting some 

mathematical  manipulations,  this  condition  may  be  written  for  the  two 

polarizations as:

For  a  given  spacing  d ,  the  optimum  β   is  found  by  numerically  solving  (20).  

 

 

For both polarizations, this is plotted in Figure 7a after being normalized to  d  for 

plotting  convenience.  In  the  limit  of 

d → ,  i.e.,  closely  packed  particles,  the 

0

optimum  β  that  ensures  smaller  losses  interestingly  tends  to  the  value 

β π=

opt

(

)

 in both polarizations. Increasing the spacing the two polarizations 

behave  differently,  as  evident  from  the  plots.  If  in  the  longitudinal  polarization 

this  value  of  β   quickly  converges  to  the  regions  of  weakly  guided  modes  with 

1β (cid:17)  (and in any case this does not admit a solution for 

d >

0.58

), the transverse 

polarization  in  this  sense  offers  a  wider  range  of  spacing  values  where  a 

concentrated  mode  allows  achieving  the  minimum  loss  condition.  Note  that  in 

both  polarizations  the  limit  of 

1β +→   yields

Re

eeα = ,  which  coincides  with  the  trivial  solution  of  a

TEM plane wave propagating in the lossless background medium, whereas in the 

longitudinal polarization we need a specific value of the polarizability to induce a 

longitudinally polarized plane wave with 

1β = . This value is determined by the 

boundary  between  the  guided  region  and  the  leaky-wave  region  for  this 

polarization,  as  given  by  (13)  and  represented  by  the  red  dashed  line  in  Fig.  2. 

-36- 

This  analysis  shows  that  this  mode  would  be  particularly  robust  to  the  material 

losses, since it is spread all over the background material. This, however, is not of 

interest in our present analysis, where we are concentrating on low-loss conditions 

for confined guided waves around the chain.

 obtained at the optimum value 

optβ  given 

in Fig. 7a, in order to show the sensitivity of the two cases of polarizations to a 

given level of material losses. In this sense the longitudinal polarization offers a 

 

-37- 

better performance, even though the guided beam is comparatively less confined, 

as Fig. 7a shows. A trade-off between these two quantities appears necessary in 

order to obtain an optimum design. We notice that the results in Fig. 7 represent 

intrinsic  physical  limitations  to  the  attenuation  factors  of  guided  propagation 

along such chains, regardless of the nature of the particles in the chain. If a more 

concentrated  mode  is  desired  for  a  given  spacing,  it  may  be  obtained  at  the 

expense of increasing the sensitivity to material loss, since the field levels at the 

particles’ location are higher. 

Once the value of 

optβ  is chosen for a given spacing, as obtained from the charts 

of Fig. 7, the optimum value of polarizability for the particles in the chain can be 

directly  obtained  from  (10),  and  it  can  be  used  as  a  design  tool  to  get  the 

minimum  attenuation  factor  and  the  desired  lateral  confinement  of  the  beam 

around the chain. 

g) Nearest-neighbor approximation 

To conclude this section it should be pointed out that for closely-spaced particles 

in both polarizations the NNA can predict with a good approximation the guiding 

properties  of  the  chain,  as  it  has  been  shown  in  the  previous  examples,  and 

therefore  the  approximate  dispersion  equations  for  small  spacing  may  be  given

confirming that in the limit of small spacing the robustness to reasonable amount 

of losses is high (and it is twice as stronger in the longitudinal forward case than 

in  the  transverse  backward  case).  As  we  show  more  in  details  in  the  following 

section,  even  though  the  individual  particle  resonance  is  affected  by  losses  in  a 

way proportional to the volume of the particles, together with 

,  the proximity 

1

to other resonant particles increases their robustness, due to the term 

2d  in (22). 

It should also be noted how the approximate dispersion given in (21) reveals the 

anomalous  feature  valid  for  closely-spaced  particles,  i.e.,  shrinking  the  scale  of 

our  setup,  which  in  this  case  is  achieved  by  reducing  the  spacing  between  the 

dipoles,  increases  the  concentration  of  the  guided  modes  around  the  chain, 

whereas usually in conventional guided-wave setups the behavior is opposite, i.e., 

reducing  the  dimensions  of  open  slab  waveguides  causes  the  field  to  be 

widespread in the background region. This is analogous to what happens in other 

guiding  geometries  involving  metamaterials  or  plasmonic  materials,  i.e.,  planar 

slabs  [41]  and  cylindrical  rods  [42]  that  we  have  recently  analyzed.  In  these 

structures, the mode can be guided beyond the diffraction limits, since the lateral 

confinement  of  the  guided  beam  may  be  considerably  reduced  below  the 

wavelength  of  operation  when  the  dimension  of  the  waveguide  is  reduced.  The 

cylindrical or planar open waveguide setups may indeed be considered as limiting

Realistic models for the particles forming the chain 

We  have  shown  in  the  previous  section  how  the  nanoparticles  composing  the 

linear  chain  under  analysis  are  well  described  by  their  effective  electric 

polarizability in the regime of interest here. 

eeα  is strictly related to the geometry 

of  the  particles  and  to  the  permittivity  of  their  material(s).  Consider,  for 

simplicity, the case of a chain of spherical homogeneous particles of radius  a  and 

permittivity  ε.  In  general  their  polarizability  may  be  obtained  from  (1)  and  the 

formulas given in [29] for  1

TMc

, but in the quasi-static limit in which the spheres 

are  much  smaller  than  the  wavelength,  as  in  the  case  of  interest  here,  one  can 

write in the lossless case [1]-[3]:

Notice that, when the particles are too small, the permittivity of the bulk material 

may  not  be  adequate  to  describe  the  quantum  effects  associated  with  the 

nanoparticles, but a corrected value of  ε, distinct form that of the bulk material  

(usually with a higher attenuation factor), may be employed [47]. We do not enter 

further into these discussions here, since it is out of the scope of the present paper, 

 

 

-40- 

but  in  such  a  case  we  note  that  Eq.  (23)  may  still  take  into  account  these 

considerations. 

a) Varying the permittivity of the particles 

It is interesting to see that due to the geometrical requirement

 (see Fig. 2 and 4). The region of 

guidance is expected to be around the resonance of the individual particles, which 

is at around 

02ε
ε= −

.

Figure 8, as an example, shows the variation of the real and imaginary parts of  β  

for  the  longitudinal  polarization,  as  a  function  of  the  spacing  d   for  a  chain  of

Re

, which in this case

happens  around 

02ε
ε= −

.  A  similar  plot  may  be  drawn  for  the  transverse 

polarization.  For  small  spacing,  not  reported  in  the  figure,  the  guided  mode  is 

more  and  more  confined,  and  the  hyperbolic  behavior  of  the  curve  is  well 

approximated  by  (21),  i.e., 

β π=

.  However,  when 

d =

1.71

,  as  noted  in 

(
/ 2d

)

the  previous  section,  the  mode  starts  leaking  out  energy,  since  Eq.  (13)  is  not 

satisfied any more. In this leaky-wave region  β has an imaginary part, which is 

positive  since  the  mode  in  this  case  is  a  forward  improper  leaky  mode.  Again, 

consistently with Fig. 2 and the previous discussion, there is another small region 

of  spacing  where  a  mode  can  be  guided,  with  a  value  of  β  increasing  with 

increasing  d . When 

β π=

/ d

 the mode enters a cut-off region where the mode 

does  not  propagate  and  the  phases  of  neighboring  dipoles  remain  180°  out  of 

phase  with  each  other,  with  the  expression  for  Re

⎤ =
⎡
β π
⎦
⎣

/ d

.  Again  an 

attenuation factor is present in this region, since no propagation is admitted and 

the  chain  is  in  its  stop-band.  The  sign  of  the  imaginary  part  in  this  case  is 

irrelevant,  since  complex  conjugates  solutions  are  admitted  in  this  stop-band 

region. 

In  this  sub-wavelength  limit,  the  regions  of  guidance  in  terms  of  the  particle 

permittivity may be easily written as:

for different values of η. 

As an example, Fig. 9 plots this range of guidance for the two polarizations and 

 

 

-43- 

Figure 9 – Range of the required permittivity of the spheres and their spacing for having guided 

modes for (a) the longitudinal polarization, and (b) the transverse polarization. 

 

Fig. 9a shows the range of required permittivities for having a guided mode with 

longitudinal polarization, whereas Fig. 9b shows the region in which the confined 

backward-wave  guided  mode  with  transverse  polarization  is  supported  by  the 

chain  (which  coincides  with  the  two-mode  region).  The  figures  show  some 

interesting  features.  First,  even  though  the  Q   of  the  dipolar  resonance  of  a 

plasmonic particle increases dramatically when its size decreases [29] consistent 

with  the  Chu  limit  [37],  and  therefore  its  resonance  rapidly  becomes  very 

concentrated  in  a  narrow  range  of  permittivities  near 

02ε
ε= −

  in  the  sub-

wavelength limit, the closely-spaced chains of small particles do not necessarily 

require  for  their  particles  to  have  permittivity  so  close  to  this  value,  since  the 

range  of  required  polarizability  diverges  as 

3d −   for  small  spacing.  These  two 

factors interestingly compensate each other, and therefore for very small closely-

spaced particles the range of necessary permittivities for guidance remains a finite 

and relatively large range for both polarizations. This is due to the strong coupling 

of  the  individual  resonances  in  the  chain,  which  allows  broadening  of  the 

individual bandwidth, similar to what happens in a transmission line metamaterial 

[48]-[49]. We are currently working on a detailed analysis of this coupling issue, 

which  will  be  presented  elsewhere  and  that  may  be  exploited  for  different 

applications. 

 

-44- 

When  the  spacing  is  increased,  the  range  of  possible  permittivities  to  yield  a 

resonant behavior narrows down around the value of 

02ε
ε= −

, since the coupling 

between the particles is diminished and the array resonance is dominated by the 

individual  resonances  of  the  particles.  The  limiting  values  may  be  interestingly 

calculated in closed form in the limit of 

d →  and are given as follows:

which is the value of permittivity that leads to a resonance in an array of spherical 

particles with spacing of 

0 / 2λ ,  in  both  polarizations.  One  may  notice  also  how 

all  the  curves  in  the  case  of  longitudinal  polarization  meet  at  the  point  where 

02ε
ε= −

 and  

d =

1.71

, since for this value of spacing the longitudinal mode has 

its cut-off at the resonance of the particles, which, in the quasi-static limit where 

(23) is valid, is independent of the size of the particles. The transverse mode has a 

similar property at 

d

d(cid:17)

ˆ / 2

. 

By  increasing  the  value  of η ,  all  quantities  in  (25)  and  (26)  tend  to 

02ε
ε= −

, 

since when we increase the spacing or decrease the size of the particles we expect 

 

-45- 

to  narrow  down  the  bandwidth  of  the  guided  mode,  thus  concentrating  on  the 

region of guidance around the frequencies for which 

Re

⎦ (cid:17) .  The case of 

0

the  longitudinal  polarization  offers  better  performance  than  the  transverse 

polarization in terms of the range of permittivities for supporting a guided mode. 

This is analogous to the other metamaterial setups for wave guiding, (e.g., [41]-

[44],  [48]-[49]),  in  which  the  operation  in  the  backward  regime  usually  has  a 

relatively smaller bandwidth.  

b) Dispersive materials 

 

 

We  have  shown  in  the  previous  paragraph  how  a  confined  guided  mode  that  is 

traveling  along  a  linear  chain  of  particles  may  be  obtained  under  the  condition 

that the particles in the chain are plasmonic, i.e., with negative permittivity. As is 

well known, however, presence of negative values of the constitutive parameters 

necessarily  implies  a  non-negligible  dispersion  with  frequency  and  thus  the 

presence  of  material  absorption  [1].  Here  therefore  we  consider  certain  realistic 

models for the frequency dispersion of the materials and we verify and augment 

the predictions of the previous section under these assumptions. 

As  an  example,  let  us  consider  a  chain  of  spherical  particles  with  Drude-model 

permittivity,  i.e.,

space. In Fig. 10 the dispersion of the guided  β versus frequency is plotted for 

the  two  cases  of  polarizations  for  particles  with  radius 

a λ=

0 / 20

  (calculated  at 

0ω ω=

)  and  spacing 

d

=

2.5

a

.  The  horizontal  axis  in  the  figure  indicates  the 

-46- 

normalized  frequency  (i.e.,  the  frequency  normalized  with  respect  to  the  central 

frequency 

0ω ω=

,  at  which  the  particles  would  experience  their  individual 

resonance, since 

02ε
ε= −

). The two curves are limited in the maximum value by 

the  line  with 

β π=

/ d

  and  in  the  minimum  value  by  the  light  line 

0kβ=

.  The 

locus 

β β=

  is  also  reported  in  the  figure,  which  meets  the  red  dashed  line 

min

(transverse polarization) at the point where the two dispersion curves meet. This 

point  can  be  considered  the  upper  limit  of  the  guidance  regime  in  the  case  of 

transverse  polarization.  Notice  that  the  vertical  axis  is  normalized  to  the  wave 

number in free space at the central frequency 

0ω . 

The  slope  of  the  two  curves  clearly  confirms  the  conclusions  of  the  previous 

sections regarding the behavior of the group velocity in the two polarizations. One 

notices  how  the  backward-wave  mode  (transverse  polarization)  has  a  smaller 

bandwidth  (about  10%  of  the  central  frequency)  when  compared  with  the 

bandwidth  of  the  forward-wave  mode  (almost  30%).  The  bandwidth  can  be 

further increased by reducing  d .  However, consistent with the previous analysis 

and  with  Fig.  9,  a  change  in  the  particle  size  while  keeping  η  fixed  does  not 

appreciably affect this aspect as long as losses are negligible.  

It  should  be  mentioned  how  the  values  of  bandwidth  obtained  here  for  the 

backward, as well as forward, regimes are larger than those usually achievable in 

a left-handed metamaterial made of resonant inclusions with an effective negative 

refraction.  This  provides  an  interesting  potential  for  extending  these  concepts  to 

2-D or 3-D collections of such closely-packed plasmonic particles, which, when 

properly combined and under proper excitation, may constitute an alternative way 

 

-47- 

of  building  broader  bandwidth  left-handed  metamaterials  with  the  desired 

effective  refraction  at  microwave,  infrared  and  optical  frequencies  [50].  The 

concepts  presented  here  are  in  many  aspects  the  1-D  analogue  of  the  planar 

geometry  reported  in  [41],  i.e.,  a  1-D  nanotransmission  line  with  features 

analogous  to  broad-band  negative-index  transmission-line  metamaterials  at 

microwave  frequencies  [48]-[49],  but  extendable  to  infrared  and  optical 

frequencies. We discuss this point in the next paragraph.

c) Nanocircuit interpretation 

The interpretation of this chain configuration in terms of nanotransmission line is 

more than a mere analogy, as highlighted above. Indeed, this concept can be fully 

motivated  in  terms  of  our  nanocircuit  interpretation  of  the  light  interaction  with 

plasmonic  particles  [51].  It  is  well  known  that  at  low  frequencies  properly 

 

-48- 

arranged circuit elements, namely, the cascades of inductors and capacitors, may 

constitute  transmission  lines  that  guide  energy  without  (or  with  small)  radiation 

losses.  At  the  IR  and  optical  frequencies,  when  conducting  materials  exhibit 

different  material  properties,  the  displacement  current  may  take  the  role  of 

conduction current, and the nanocircuit elements have to be re-envisioned based 

on  a  different  physical  mechanism.  In  particular,  we  have  shown  in  [51]  how 

plasmonic and non-plasmonic nanoparticles may be envisioned as nanoinductors 

and nonplasmonic elements, respectively. In the case of interest here, the chains 

of plasmonic particles interleaved and surrounded with non-plasmonic gaps may 

therefore be interpreted as the cascade of such nanoinductors and nanocapacitors 

that  constitute  nano-transmission  lines  in  the  optical  regime  when  suitably 

designed  and  properly  excited.  In  the  longitudinal  propagation,  due  to  the 

polarization  of  the  electric  field,  the  plasmonic  particles  may  be  heuristically 

regarded as the “series” nanoinductors surrounded by “parallel” nano-capacitors, 

providing  an  equivalent  L-C  transmission  line  with  forward-wave  behavior, 

whereas  in  the  transverse  polarization  the  roles  of  inductors  and  capacitors  are 

essentially  interchanged,  providing  a  1-D  backward-wave  transmission  line, 

analogous  to  those  in  the  microwave  negative-index  TL  metamaterials.  This  is 

consistent with the findings of the previous section. An extension to 2-D and 3-D 

may  therefore  allow  synthesizing  effective  2-D  and  3-D  nanotransmission  line 

negative-index  metamaterials  at  optical  frequencies  [50],  analogous  to  those 

synthesized  at  microwaves  using  lumped  circuit  elements  [48]-[49].  The 

advantages of broad bandwidth and robustness to losses, which are typical of such 

 

-49- 

metamaterials  at  microwave  frequencies,  are  expected  to  also  apply  to  such 

optical  nano-metamaterials,  as  these  1-D  results  confirm  and  our  preliminary 

results  on  the  3-D  geometry  show  [50].  We  will  present  a  complete  analysis  of 

such bulk optical nanotransmission line metamaterials in the near future.  

It is worth noting that we have also utilized similar concepts in order to envision 

and  explain  the  sub-diffraction  low-attenuation  propagation  along  thin  planar 

layers  or  cylindrical  rods  of  plasmonic  and  non-plasmonic  materials  [41]-[42]. 

These cases may be seen as the limit of vanishing gaps in the nanoparticle chains 

presented  here.  An  extended  analysis  of  the  analogies  of  these  array  problems 

with the transmission-line circuit theory will be presented in a future work. 

c) Material losses 

 

The  behavior  of  these  structures  in  the  presence  of  material  losses  has  been 

already  analyzed  in  the  previous  section,  and  the  dependence  of  the  attenuation 

factor 

iβ  on losses has been found to be directly proportional to the quantity 

1

lossα−

. 

Here  we  embed  the  presence  of  losses  in  the  material  permittivity.  This  allows 

evaluating how the size of the particles that form the chain may play an important 

role  as  a  lower  limit  on  squeezing  and  confining  the  guided  beam  below  the 

diffraction limit.  

Adding  to  (23)  the  contribution  of  material  losses,  we  can  write  for  a  single 

particle with complex permittivity

If

lossα−

 grows with increasing the imaginary part of the permittivity, as physically 

expected,  it  also  increases  with  the  inverse  volume  of  the  particle.  Therefore,  if 

reducing  the  size  of  the  particles  while  keeping  η  fixed  may  increase  the 

bandwidth of guided propagation along the chain (since the spacing between them 

should be accordingly reduced to allow a fixed η), a lower limit is represented by 

(27)  combined  with  (22),  which  ensures  that  there  is  a  physical  lower  limit  on 

squeezing  the  beam  in  a  sub-wavelength  scale  with  the  presence  of  realistic 

losses. Therefore, as physically expected, there is a trade-off between bandwidth 

and  sub-diffraction  on  the  one  hand,  and  the  sensitivity  to  losses  on  the  other 

hand.  This  is  also  physically  justifiable  due  to  the  concentration  of  the  guided 

beam in a sub-wavelength region where material losses are present.

which  shows  how  the  attenuation  factor  in  this  configuration  is  inversely 

proportional to the linear size of the particles, much better than the volume (cubic) 

dependence that an isolated plasmonic resonance generally shows. Clearly, for a 

given size of the particles, more robustness to losses is ensured when the particles 

are closely packed, as the presence of 

2η  shows in the numerator of (28). 

d) Arbitrary polarization 

 

 

-51- 

Elliptically  polarized  modes  propagating  along  the  chain  may  be  obtained  by 

exciting both longitudinal and transverse components of the polarizable particles. 

Assuming  an  isotropic  polarizability,  and  referring  to  Fig.  1,  the  polarization  of 

the exciting dipole at 

x =  may be written, without lose of generality, as: 

0

p

0

(29) 

where 

la   and 

ta   are,  respectively,  the  complex  amplitudes  driving  the 

longitudinal  and  the  transverse  polarization.  Owing  to  the  linearity  of  the 

problem,  the  two  modal  polarizations  of  the  system  may  be  analyzed 

independently  in  this  case.  Along  the  same  direction,  e.g.,  the  positive  x ,  we 

would experience the propagation of two orthogonal modes, the longitudinal one 

with  positive  phase  and  group  velocity,  i.e., 

lβ >   and  the  transverse  one  with 

0

tβ <  (here we neglect the possible excitation of the spurious non-confined mode 

0

in the transverse polarization). The generic amplitude of the  N -th dipole would

d) Realistic plasmonic materials 

From our previous discussions above, we have seen that chains of metamaterial or 

noble metal particles with negative permittivity may provide interesting potentials 

for  guiding  a  sub-diffraction  beam  with  a  relatively  low  attenuation  factor  (we 

reiterate here that μ-negative (MNG) materials may be employed as well, since by 

duality they would support coupled magnetic resonances). However, in analyzing 

the possibility of applying these concepts to a real-life setup, we have to deal with 

the required properties of the materials of the particles. As previously shown, the 

chain  of  dielectric  particles  made  of  standard  materials  would  not  provide  the 

required  guiding  properties.  Metamaterials  may  be  properly  synthesized  by 

embedding  resonant  inclusions  in  a  host  dielectric  in  order  to  have  the  desired 

effective negative properties [52]-[55]. Clearly, the size of such inclusions should 

be much smaller than that of the metamaterial particle in order to let the particle 

be considered as a bulk material with negative parameters. Therefore, in dealing 

with  sub-wavelength  particles,  the  inclusions  that  “make”  the  materials  may  be 

required  to  be  much  smaller  than  the  operating  wavelength,  and  still  produce  a 

sizeable resonance. This may represent a challenging task for the designer. Even 

the anisotropy of the metamaterials may represent an issue in this sense, since the 

inclusions may have preferred directions for their interaction with the impinging 

field.  Homogeneous  spherical  particles,  however,  are  polarized  with  a  uniform 

 

 

-53- 

field inside their overall volume at the dipolar resonance, and therefore it would 

be  sufficient  to  orient  the  axis  of  anisotropy  in  the  direction  of  the  expected 

polarization of the field in order to obtain results consistent with this analysis.  

If metamaterials may provide a flexible way of tailoring the material properties at 

the  desired  frequency  of  operation,  at  infrared  and  optical  frequencies  noble 

metals  and  polar  dielectrics  naturally  possess  the  required  isotropic  negative 

permittivity [1]-[6]. On the one hand this is useful in envisioning a direct and easy 

application  of  the  present  analysis,  but  still  the  set  of  noble  metals  is  limited  in 

terms of the possible material dispersion and the range of frequencies at which the 

desired  values  of  permittivity  are  met  with  possibly  low  losses.  Additional 

degrees  of  freedom  in  the  geometry  of  the  particles  of  the  chain  may  provide 

possibilities  for  tuning  the  properties  of  these  guided  modes  at  the  desired 

frequency.  For 

instance,  following  [29],  core-shell  concentric  spherical 

nanoparticles may suggest a way for tailoring the properties of the guided modes 

along the chain. We have found that the choice of the proper filling ratio (i.e., the 

ratio  of  radii)  of  core-shell  spheres  partially  filled  with  ENG  or  MNG  materials 

may allow tuning the particle electric or magnetic polarizability in frequency.

. Using the closed form 

expressions  for  these  quantities  derived  in  [29],  one  can  evaluate  the  exact 

dispersion for a chain of core-shell spherical particles. 

 

-54- 

Let  us  consider  for  instance  the  case  of  a  chain  of  particles  of  radius 

a

=

15

nm

 

with spacing 

d

=

75

nm

 excited at optical wavelength of 

λ =
0

500 nm

. Assuming 

homogeneous  spherical  particles  in  the  chain,  the  modal  dispersion  versus  the 

permittivity is reported in Fig. 11a for the case of longitudinal polarization, where 

one  can  note  the  range  of  permittivities  over  which  the  chain  would  support  a 

guided mode. A too low permittivity (in this case below 

ε

= −

2.16

ε
0

 would start 

leaking energy out of the chain, and a too high permittivity, i.e., for 

ε

> −

1.97

ε
0

, 

would enter the cut-off region of the array, where 

β π=

/

d

 and the attenuation 

r

factor  increases  with  ε.  Clearly,  the  range  of  frequencies  for  which  a  realistic 

material  may  be  available  with  these  required  values  of  permittivities  might  be 

narrow  and  may  not  coincide  with  the  frequency  of  interest  (not  to  mention  the 

fact  that  this  range  may  not  necessarily  correspond  to  a  low-loss  range  of 

frequencies).    Imagine  we  are  willing  to  use  spherical  particles  made  of  silver, 

which  at 

λ =
0

500 nm

  have  a 

real  part  of  permittivity  given  by 

Re

⎡
Agε
⎣

⎤ = −
⎦

9.77

ε
0

  [56].  Silver  has  a  relatively  low  material  absorption  at  this 

frequency, so it may appear to be a suitable material for these purposes. However, 

the  real  part  of  permittivity  clearly  does  not  fall  in  the  range  of  allowable 

permittivities,  as  Fig.  11a  shows.  However,  if  we  cover  silicon  carbide  spheres 

(

SiCε

=

6.52

ε
0

  [57])  with  silver  shells,  maintaining  the  same  outer  radius  for  the 

overall  particle,  we  can  move  the  resonance  of  the  core-shell  particles  to  the 

desired frequency, as found in [29]. Fig. 11b shows the variation of  β with the 

ratio of radii 

γ =

1 /a a

 at the frequency of interest, i.e., at 

λ =
0

500 nm

.

 for the longitudinal polarization; (b) Variation of normalized 

rβ   in terms of the

In this example, the spacing among the particles is pretty large, and therefore still 

the sensitivity to the material parameters of the chain is relatively high in order to 

get a low-attenuation mode, but this shows how in principle it is possible to add 

additional degrees of freedom to the problem in order to adjust the frequency of 

 

-56- 

operation and its properties. Here the degree of freedom is provided by the filling 

ratio γ, but in other cases it may be represented by the shape of the object and its 

eccentricity  (for  instance  for  ellipsoidal  particles).  It  is  clear  how  by  properly 

choosing  the  materials  in  the  regions  where  they  show  sufficiently  low  losses, 

together with the proper choice of the chain geometrical parameters in the regions 

with minimal loss influence (20), it may in principle be possible to tailor modes 

that  can  propagate  for  relatively  long  distances  in  a  sub-diffractive  mode.  As  a 

final  example,  Fig.  12  shows  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  guided  wave 

numbers for longitudinal modes supported by a chain of spherical particles made 

of silver, using the realistic experimental data available in the literature [56] for 

bulk  silver  at  optical  frequencies  with 

a

,  as  a  function  of 

the  wavelength  of  operation 

0λ .  Operating  around 

λ =

370 nm

  can  lead  to  a 

guided  wave  propagation  with  a  reasonable  good  ratio  of 

iβ β ,  providing  the 

/r

possibility of sub-diffraction propagation with a relatively low attenuation.

Conclusions 

In this paper we have analyzed in detail the various aspects of guiding properties 

of linear arrays of metamaterial/plasmonic particles. After deriving novel closed-

form analytical dispersion relations for the sub-diffractive guided modes of such 

arrays,  we  have  been  able  to  provide  conditions  for  minimal  absorption  and 

maximum  bandwidth  of  such  modes.  A  discussion  on  the  realistic  possibility  of 

realizing such setups, with numerical examples considering ohmic absorption and 

frequency  dispersion  has  also  been  provided.  This  may  open  new  doors  in  the 

realization  of  microwave,  infrared  and  optical  nanotransmission  lines  and  nano-

waveguides.  Enlightened  by  the  nanocircuit  interpretation  of  this  phenomenon, 

also an extension to 2-D and 3-D setups for the realization of broader band left-

handed metamaterials at high frequencies has been envisioned and forecasted.

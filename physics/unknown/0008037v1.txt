ELLIPTICAL  X-RAY  SPOT  MEASUREMENT

Roger A. Richardson, Stephen Sampayan, John Weir, LLNL, Livermore, CA, USA

The advantage of a rollbar measurement over a true 2D
measurement (such as a pinhole) is  that  the  signal  can be
averaged  in  one  dimension,  and  photon  statistics  are
vastly improved. These image lineouts  are typically  fitted
to an integrated gaussian function (erfc) to obtain  the  spot
size.  The  spot  size  is  defined  as  the  full  width  at  half
maximum  (FWHM)  of  the  gaussian.  Alternatively  the
lineouts can be fitted to a double gaussian, or the FFT can
be done.

To measure the resolution of the  diagnostic, the  rollbar
was  placed  adjacent  to  the  scintillator,  which  gave  a
measured edge blur  (using  an erfc fit)  of  2.7  mm.  At  the
radiographic magnification of 4 used to take this data, this
gives a  resolution  of  0.67  mm.  The magnification is  the
ratio of  the  distances from  the  rollbar  to  the  scintillator
and from the rollbar to the spot.

A  sequence  of  four  accelerator  shots  with  identical
settings were used to estimate a 7%  error in  the  measured
RMS (root mean square) spot size, and a 14%  error in  the
ratio of horizontal/vertical (ellipticity).  This  measurement
is the basis for the error bars on the plots in this paper.

3.1 Elliptical targets
 The accelerator beam is typically  focused on  a flat,  5  mil
tantalum  target  to  produce  x-rays  detected  by 
this
diagnostic. To check the  accuracy of  this  measurement, a
target  was  constructed  that  consisted  of  small  tantalum
buttons,  which  were  glued  onto  a  thin  sheet  of  Mylar.
The targets were small (on the order of the spot size of the
beam), elliptical  in  shape,  1  x  1.5  mm,  and  oriented  to
align with the rollbar axis  (“horizontal” and “vertical”). A
successful shot is shown in Fig. 1, which is a 10 ns  gated
image, centered temporally in the middle of the pulse. The
data is somewhat noisy because the outer part of the  beam
missed the target and created noise x-rays. Gaussian fits  of
the image lineouts in the horizontal and vertical directions
gives  a  measured  spot  size  of  1.1  x  1.6  mm,  which
compares well  with  the  target  size  and  shape,  especially
considering the minimum resolution of ~0.7 mm

Abstract

The so-called roll  bar measurement uses  a heavy metal
material, optically  thick  to  x-rays,  to  form  a  shadow  of
the x-ray origination spot. This spot is where  an energetic
electron beam interacts with a high Z  target.  The material
(the  “roll  bar”)  is  slightly  curved  to  avoid  alignment
problems.  The  roll  bar  is  constructed  and  positioned  so
that the x-rays are shadowed in  the  horizontal and vertical
directions, so information is  obtained in  two  dimensions.
If  a  beam  profile  is  assumed  (or  measured  by  other
means), the  equivalent  x-ray  spot  size  can  be  calculated
from  the  x-ray  shadow  cast  by  the  roll  bar.  Thus  the
ellipticity  of  the  beam  can  be  calculated,  assuming  the
ellipse of the  x-ray spot  is  aligned with  the  roll  bar.  The
data is recorded using a scintillator and gated camera. Data
will  be  presented  from  measurements  using  the  ETA  II
induction  LINAC.  The  accuracy  of  the  measurement  is
checked using small elliptical targets.

1  INTRODUCTION

This  paper  describes  a  “rollbar”  diagnostic  used  to
determine  the  spot  size  of  a  pulsed  x-ray  source.  The
innovation  described here is  a rollbar in  two  dimensions,
so  that  the  beam  ellipticity  (with  respect  to  the  rollbar
axis) and center can be measured. A  gated camera is  used
so  that  a time  history  of  the  spot  size  can  be  generated
using multiple shots or cameras.

 2  EXPERIMENTAL  SETUP

The  diagnostic  is  basically  the  same  as  described  in
reference 1. A thick block of Tungsten alloy metal is  used
to  image a x-ray spot  generated  by  the  focused  beam  of
the ETA II LINAC [2]. The edge of  the  block  has  a large
(1 meter) radius (“rolled”) so that alignment is not critical.
The modification described in this paper is  that  two  edges
of  the  rollbar  (perpendicular  to  the  line  of  sight)  are
radiused, so  that  the  spot  size  can  be  determined  in  two
dimensions and the  horizontal &  vertical  components  of
the  beam can be measured.    A  fit  to  the  data  gives  the
spot  size  and  position  of  the  x-ray  spot 
these
directions.

in 

The  shadow  of  the  x-ray  spot  is  projected  onto  a
scintillator  (1  cm  Bicron BC-400), which is  then  imaged
using  an  intensified  gated  camera.  The  cameras  used  to
take the data were a Cohu SIT tube, with a typically  10ns
gate, and/or the  DiCAM  Pro  camera from Cooke,  with  a
5 ns gate.

 3.3  Tuning  curve

 The  final  focus  of  the  accelerator  is  minimized  by
adjusting the  final magnet  and  plotting  the  spot  size  as
determined  by  the  rollbar.    A  typical  tuning  curve  is
shown in Fig. 4.  In  this  tune,  the  beam is  almost  round
at  the  spot  size  minimum,  and  become  elliptical  as  the
spot size increases.

 3.2  Quadrapole magnet variation

 A quadrapole magnet in  the  beamline of  the  accelerator
was varied to adjust the beam ellipticity. This produced an
elliptical x-ray spot size as illustrated in Fig. 2.

 The  electron  beam  leaves  a  witness  hole  in 

the
tantalum  disk after a shot.  These holes  were elliptical  in
shape during this  data series,  and the  measured ellipticity
of the holes linearly increased with the  quadrapole current,
Fig.  3.  The hole  shapes  also  confirmed  the  direction  of
the  long  axis  of  the  ellipse  (horizontal).   In  general,  the
witness  holes  do  not  give  an  accurate  measurement  of
spot size, however in this case they did correlate well with
the ellipticity.

 3.4  X-Ray  spot  vs.  time

 By  changing  the  delay  of  the  gated  camera,  a  time
history  of  the  spot  size can be constructed with  multiple
shots.  A  typical  data  series  is  shown  in  figure  4.  This
illustrates the beam degradation during the  rise and fall  of
the pulse due to energy variations in the beam.

4  SUMMARY

 The two dimensional rollbar technique gives an accurate
measurement of  the  spot  size in  two  dimensions  (in  the
rollbar orientation).  The data can be analyzed to  give  the
x-ray  spot  ellipticity  and  centroid.  It  is  a  valuable
diagnostic  for  tuning  a  radiographic  accelerator  and
studying beam-target interactions.

 3.5  Beam  motion

 The x-ray spot  center  can  also  be  calculated  from  the
data and plotted. Figure 5  shows  some  data taken using  a
gas  cell for the  final focus [3].    This  experiment  used  a
small  cell  filled  with  nitrogen  gas  to  focus  the  beam
without  using  a  magnet.  The  electron  beam  ionizes  the
gas  in  the  cell,  and  the  resulting  plasma  neutralizes  the
space charge of the  beam,  causing the  beam to  pinch  due
to  self-magnetic forces.   Because the  focusing  magnet  is
turned off,  the  beam now  has  freedom of  motion  on  the
target and moves during the shot.

Abstract.  A  new  effect,  “gas  amplification  of  electron  energy”  is  reported 
here;  namely  when  a  cylindrical  pyroelectric  crystal  such  as  (LiNbO3)  is 
contained in a concentric cylindrical chamber and is heated and then allowed 
to cool in a dilute gas the maximum energy of the resultant focused electron 
beam more than doubles as the pressure increases from 0.05 to 4 mTorr for 
seven different gases. 

Even though pyroelectric crystals 

 
 
have been known since ancient Greek 
times1, surprising new effects and 
practical applications are constantly 
being discovered1-12, for example; 
electrons accelerated by heating and 
cooling such crystals in dilute gases have 
produced energetic brehmsstralung and 
characteristic K x-rays up to Au.8 There 
is a voluminous literature on electron 
emission by pyroelectric crystals.  
Reference 10, a comprehensive review 
article, is representative but does not 
suggest that such crystals can produce 
focused, energetic electron beams.  
Much of the current industrial use of 
these crystals is in infrared detection, 
sensitive temperature-change detectors 
and photonics, e.g. the emission of THz 
radiation in LiNbO3 crystals11.   For 
these reasons few studies of the behavior 
of these crystals in dilute gases have 
previously been done so no one has yet 
discovered the phenomena reported here, 
namely that if a LiNbO3 crystal is heated  
 
 
 

 
and then allowed to cool in a dilute gas, 
the electron beam energy and intensity  
depends strongly on the gas pressure and 
less on gas type.

There are interesting practical 

applications of pyroelectric crystals in 
dilute gases for laboratory teaching4 of 
X-ray and electron physics.  The various 
parameters such as pressure, temperature 
etc. can be controlled by student-written 
LabView programs5. A further 

1 

application of this work is to use a 
pyroelectric crystal to produce 
bremsstrahlung X-rays, which can 
fluoresce high-Z targets and produce 
very background-free characteristic K X-
ray spectra9 of elements at least up to Pb. 
The experimental arrangement used for 
this work is diagrammed schematically 
in Fig. 1.  It was designed expressly to 
study the behavior of the focused 
electron beams, Vs pressure and gas 
type. Since results are geometry 
dependent, we used a cylindrical LiNbO3 
crystal, 10 mm x 4 mm dia. whose + z 
base was epoxied to a 62 ohm resistor.  
This assembly, which could be moved 
along the axis, was mounted axially in a 
glass cylinder 45 cm x 7.5 cm dia.  The 
chamber was capped by metal end 
plates.  The crystal is heated to ~180 oC 
by passing a current (~120 mA) through 
the resistor.  The crystal then cools 
naturally.  The electrons are detected by 
a fully depleted 100 μm surface barrier 
detector located behind a 0.1 mm slit. 
Varying the distance between the slit and 
the crystal does not significantly effect

drops by almost a factor of two.  Figure 
3 shows the electron counting rate (on a 
log scale) Vs. time.  It also shows the 
cooling curve for the crystal and the 
pressure in the chamber.  It can be seen 
from the inset that at 2470 sec the 
pressure is reduce over a period of ~ 30 
sec by closing the leak valve to the gas 
supply which causes the electron count 
rate to increase dramatically and then 
fall to below its former value while 
simultaneously the beam is also 
defocused.  This change in electron 
count rate and electron energy as the 
pressure is reduced is also shown in fig. 
2(g-i).

      Fig.  4.  Electron energy Vs crystal temperature at 3 

different pressures as the crystal cools. 
 
Figure 4 shows the electron energy as a 

 
function of temperature, which is directly 
related to cooling time (see fig 3) at three 
different pressures.  At the lowest pressure 
(8x10-7 Torr) the electron energy slowly 
increases as the crystal cools.  In this case 
the electron energy is more closely 
proportional to the exposed surface 
polarization charge3 density.  If the pressure 
is increased to 1.67 mTorr the electron 
energy slowly increases from ~50 keV to ~ 
100 keV as the crystal cools from 900 C to 
250 C.  This is the gas amplification effect.  
We believe it is related to the formation of 
plasma at the crystal surface.  Finally at 2.3 
mTorr the electron energy increases further 
until the crystal cools to about 30 oC and 
then starts to drop with further cooling.  
Again this is the result of the net charge on 
the crystal surface (polarization and 
adsorbed ions) as well as the plasma at the 
surface.             

 
Figure 5 summarizes the main effect,” 

gas amplification of electron energy”, 
reported in this paper, which as far as we 
know has not previously been reported in  

Fig.  5.  Maximum electron energy Vs pressure for 7 
gases. Each data point is the maximum electron 
energy observed as the crystal cooled from ~180 oC at 
the pressure indicated. 
 
 

the literature. Data points were collected 
after adjusting the pressure and then cycling 
the crystal once completely over a thermal 
cycle.   It shows that the maximum electron 
energy more than doubles in the range from 
0.05 to 4 mTorr for a variety of gases.  The 
maximum electron energy then levels off 
and decreases with further pressure increase.  
Also the rate of increase in energy with 
pressure starts out the same for most gases 
(~50 keV/mTorr) whereas in the case of He 
it is ~ 25 keV/mTorr starting at 1.5 mtorr, 
and in the case of Ar it is 57 keV/mTorr.

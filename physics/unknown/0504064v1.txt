We  discuss  how  the  observation  of  Rabi  flopping  oscillations  in  a  laser  cooled 
atomic sample could be used as a  microwave power standard. The rubidium atoms 
are  first  trapped  in  a  standard  MOT,  then  optically  pumped,  and  dropped.  As  they 
enter the interaction region, a resonant pulsed microwave field is applied. Following 
the  interaction  lasting  up  to  10  ms,  a  probe  laser  beam  is  turned  on  and  the 
fluorescence measures the population inversion.   

Figure  1(a)  shows  the  oscillation  for  a  typical  field.  The  microwave  field  is 
resonant  with  the  hyperfine  structure  of  Rb87  atoms.  The  experiment  was  repeated 
many  times,  varying  the  microwave  pulse  length.    The  observed  periodic  function, 
with  as  many  as  15  cycles,  allows  us  to  determine  the  frequency  precisely.  Figure 
1(b)  shows  this  frequency  as  a  function  of the  field  amplitude. Any variation  from 
linearity is less than 0.2 %. 

Knowledge of the oscillator strength of the transition and the radiation pattern of 
the  waveguide  would  allow  this  method  to  be  used  as  an  absolute  standard  for 
microwave power measurement.

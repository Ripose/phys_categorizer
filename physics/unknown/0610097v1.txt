The  Schrödinger  equation  based  on  the  de  Broglie  wave  is  the  most  fundamental  equation  of  the 
quantum  mechanics.  There  can  be  no  doubt  about  it’s  prediction  validity.  However,  the  probabilistic 
interpretation on the quantum mechanics has insoluble semantic interpretations like ‘reduction of wave 
packet’ on observations of physical  values.  Especially,  it is  not clear that the  wave  function Ψ which is 
described by complex function, is whether ‘formality’ or ‘reality’ to express the state of particle motion. On 
this paper, we interpret the wave nature of particle as not the inherency of particle itself, but the motional 
property of particle in fluctuated space-time due to the kinetic energy and momentum the belief that the 
kinetic energy and momentum fluctuates the microscopic space-time, and the particle move through the 
fluctuated space-time adversely. Then, through the particle motion in the Euclidean space-time, the particle 
will  be  recognized  as  if  it  has  the  wave  nature.  We  estimate  the  governing  equation  of  fluctuations  of 
microscopic space-time based on the macroscopic law of motion. On this paper, the equivalence between the 
governing equation and the Schrödinger equation is indicated.

§1. Introduction 

From a practical point of view, there seems little doubt 
that the quantum mechanics is complete. And the other, as 
long  as  the  interpretation  about  the  wave  nature  of  the 
particle  is  uncertain,  the  quantum  mechanics  leaves  a 
lasting  impression  on  the  woolliness  as  typified  by  the 
‘complementarity  principle’.  As  well  known,  so  many 
approaches  were  tried  to  understand  the  wave  nature  of 
particle [1]-[3]. This paper is also relevant to one approach to 
understand  the  wave  nature  of  particle  and  making  the 
connection between the standard probabilistic interpretation 
and the new approach. To be consistent with the quantum 
mechanics, the every approach assures of the derivation of 
the Schrödinger equation.   

The  particle  motion  is  recognized  and  described 
through  the  Euclidean  space-time  on  the  macroscopic 
systems. If on the microscopic space-time the kinetic energy 
and  momentum  of  particle  give  fluctuations  to  space-time 
and  to  the  contrary  the  particle  motion  through  the 
fluctuated  space-time,  then  we  may  recognize  the  particle 
path  with  fluctuations  in  macroscopic  space-time.  As  the 
dynamic  equation 
is  described  by  the  macroscopic 
space-time system, the ‘superficial’ fluctuations are added to 
particle  motions.  Under  such  a  hypothesis,  using  the 
principle of the least action due to macroscopic Lagrangian, 
the governing equation of the fluctuation of the microscopic 
space-time is estimated.   

 

§2. Theoretical Approach 

On  this  paper,  the  free  particle  under  the  uniform 
motion is considered. Here, the macroscopic space-time and 
the  microscopic  space-time  are  expressed  as  (X,  T),  (x,  t) 
respectively. Further, as the microscopic space-time (X, T) is 
the functions of x and t, these functions are expressed φ and 
η, respectively. Then, the coordinate conversion between   
(X, T) and (x, t) are

And,  as  dynamic  law,  the  following  hypothesizes  are 

considered.   
Hypothesis Ⅰ:   

On the macroscopic space-time system, the speed of free 
particle under uniform motion is defined as follows using of 
the macroscopic space X and time T.

=                                                                   （3）

Hypothesis  Ⅱ:   

On  the  macroscopic  space-time  system,  the  particle 
moveｓ  along the geodesic line due to the least action. The 
geodesic line is defined by a function which minimize the 
following variation:

The second hypothesis is the Lagrangian function L defined 
by  (5)  on  the  macroscopic  space-time  system,  has  the 
minimum  value  under  the  microscopic  space-time.’  i.e.  the 
Lagrangian  function  L  satisfies  the  Euler-Lagrangian 
equation  defined  by  the  microscopic  space-time  system.  On 
the  macroscopic  system,  (5）  give  the  linear  motion  as  the 
geodesic line of uniform motion. So, this hypothesis requires 
that  the  macroscopic  geodesic  line  is  also  the  one  on  the 
microscopic space-time.   

First,  the  Hypothesis  Ⅰ  is  considered.  From  （1）,  （2）

This  means  that  the  function  Ψ  which  is  defined  in  the 
microscopic space-time satisfies the one dimensional classical 
wave equation.

-Lagrangian equation in the microscopic space-time. The L is 
defined by the macroscopic space-time as follows,

Newly,  theΨ satisfies  the  classical  wave  equation  and  vice 
versa. (13) certifies that the Ψ  defined as the solution of (27) 
always  minimizes  the  Lagrangian  function  (14).  However, 
(27)  is  merely  the  kinetic  condition  which  the  microscopic 
space-time  should  satisfy  to  consistent  with  (3)  and  (5).  To 
consistent  with  the  macroscopic  motion  equation,  the 
governing  equation  that  describes  the  fluctuation  of  the 
microscopic  space-time  should  satisfy 
following 
relationship between the kinetic energy and the momentum. 
It  means  that  only  the  solution  of  (27)  which  satisfies  the 
following  relationship  in  addition,  as  a  binding  condition  is

And, as might be expected, the relationship of  =V/2 can be

equation  of  the  dispersive  wave  which  is  common  of  the

These are just the Schrödinger equation of Ψ  andΨ* which 
is  the  complex  conjugate  function  of  Ψ.  So,  the  general 
solution of (37) is given as a sum of the solutions of (39) and 
(40) as follows,

This means the solutionΨ is always the real function and is 
not the general solution of the Schrödinger equation that may 
describe by the complex function. Further, as (37) includes the 
second-order  temporal  differentiation,  on  the  standard 
probabilistic interpretation (37) never certify the conservation 
law  of  the  probability  density.  So,  we  can  guess  that 
Schrödinger abandoned (37) as the correct wave equation of 
particle  motion.  On  this  paper,  (37)  is  re-evaluated  using 
Dirac’s  formula  [5]  that  was  used  to  the  relativistic  wave 
equation  for  the  electron  from  the  Klein-Gordon  equation. 
First, we extend (37) to the three dimensional one as follows,

§3. Discussions 

Firstly, let us consider the meaning of theΨ. TheΨ is 

defined by (9) as follows, 

ηφψ
−=

=
By the modification, (68) is rewritten as 

TVX
⋅−

V

.                                                (68)

ψ+⋅=

.                                                                (69) 

In the macroscopic dynamic law of the free particle, the Ψ  is 
constant  that  corresponds  to  the  initial  condition.  On  the 
other hand, because of the existence of the fluctuations of the 
microscopic  space-time  by  the  particle  motion  in  the 
microscopic motion law, theΨ never becomes constant. That 
is,  the Ψ  can  be  interpreted  as  the ‘disparity’  or ‘deviation’ 
between the Newton’s law and the microscopic dynamic law. 
Then,  with  the  limiting  behavior  of  Ψ→0,  (69)  can  be 
completely  corresponding  to  the  Newton’s  law  whose  initial 
position is assumed to be 0.   

When the fluctuations of the microscopic space-time are 
negligible small, the microscopic space-time systems may be 
equivalent  to  the  macroscopic  ones.  Then,  it  is  extremely 
natural that the microscopic dynamical law can be close to the 
Newton’s  law  defined  on  the  macroscopic  systems.  The 

present concept of the microscopic dynamic law says that the 
wave function Ψ  and the macroscopic i.e. Newton’s one can 
be related directly without using the Ehrenfest theory. The Ψ 
defined by (9) has the dimension of distance. If theΨ  is the 
complex function, the inner product of the Ψ  and Ψ*, that is 
the  complex  conjugate  function  of Ψ,  has  the  dimension  of 
the distance squared. When the inner product of (Ψ・Ψ*) is 
normalized to unity, the standard probability interpretation of 
the Copenhagen school can be applicable to understand the 
meaning of theΨ.       
          On two particle systems, the wave function is defined as 
a  six  dimensional  ‘wave’  that  includes  the  coordinates  of 
particle A and particle B. Even on this case,    the Ψ  can be 
considered  that  it  express  the ‘disparity’  with  the  Newton’s 
law.  The  disparity  is  caused  by  the  fluctuations  of  the 
microscopic space-time through the motion of the particle A 
and B. So, only the Ψ  of the one particle system is wavelike 
exactly.   
          Secondarily,  let  us  consider  the  difference  between  the 
macroscopic  and  microscopic  motion  of  the  particle.  If  the 
microscopic  space-time  system  has  the  fluctuation  for  the 
macroscopic  and  Euclidean  system  where  we  can  recognize 
and define the particle motion, we should accept the particle 
existence at the ‘past’ and the ‘future’ of the microscopic time 
at the ‘macroscopic present’. Then, the particle may not have 
the ‘deterministic’  path  at  the  macroscopic  ‘present’,  as  the 
macroscopic  ‘present’  includes  the  microscopic  ‘past’  and 
‘future’. The relativity of the ‘present’ between the macroscopic 
and  microscopic  times  clarifies  the  deference  between  the 
quantum  mechanics  and  the  classical  ones.  That  is,  the 
classical  dynamic  equation 
is  determined  along  the 
unidirectional time axis from the past to the future. But, in 
the microscopic systems, the ‘past’ and ‘future’ of microscopic 
time  at  the  macroscopic  ‘present’  disturb  to  predict  the 
‘deterministic’  particle  motion  as  the  meaning  of  the 
macroscopic systems.   

In  that  sense,  our  actions  to  observe  the  physical 
quantity of the particle motion may make the ‘present’ of the 
particle  on  the  macroscopic  systems.  The  observation  is  the 
frozen  figure  of  the  microscopic  motion  at  the  macroscopic 
‘present’.  It  means  that  the  observation  is  the  action  to 
hypostatize the particle motion at the macroscopic ‘present’. 
Then, the observation gives an unavoidable interaction to the 
particle  motion.  As  well  as  the  interaction  is  usually 
estimated  by  the  Compton  effects  on  the  Heisenberg 
uncertainty principle, it may be considered as the interference 
between the double fluctuated space-time due to the particle 
motion and the observation.   
          From  here  onwards,  even  if  the  fluctuation  of  the 
microscopic  space-time  leads  to  the  wave  nature  of  the 
particle, the probability interpretation can have applicability 
to predict the particle motion as above mentioned. However, 
the  most 
important  difference  with  the  probability 
interpretation is that the particle is just the ‘particle’ and the 
wave  nature  is caused  by  the  fluctuation of  the  microscopic

process. On the process, Nelson required the fluctuation term 
to  the  Newton’s  law  due  to  the  Brownian  motions  and  the 
new local differential to define the velocity on the zigzag path. 
And  the  other,  as  the  present  concept  never  requires  these 
assumptions, it may be simpler.   
 
§4. Conclusion 
          On the standard quantum mechanics, the wave nature 
of the particle is considered as the attribution of particle itself. 
And  the  other,  on  this  paper,  the  wave  nature  is  the 
attribution of the microscopic space-time. The particle motion 
gives  fluctuations  to  the  microscopic  space-time,  and  vice 
versa, the space-time determined the particle motion. Then, 
on  the  macroscopic  and  Euclidean  space-time  systems,  the 
particle motion may be recognized as the wave nature. Using 
such  a  concept,  the  wave-particle  duality  is  understood 
naturally. Further, the Schrödinger equation that includes the 
spin  angular  momentum  is  derived  naturally.  Even  this 
concept,  the  probability  interpretation  can  be  applicable  to 
predict  the  physical  quantity.  But,  as  the  present  concept 
never  requires  the  reduction  of  wave  pocket  on  the 
observation,  this  is  looked  more  rational  than  the  concept 
based on the wave nature of particle.

space-time systems on this paper. That is, every particle has 
and  recognizes  their  own  deterministic  paths  in  the 
microscopic space-time systems. However, on the macroscopic 
systems,  due  to  ‘the  relativity  of  the  present’  and  the 
unavoidable interaction, their microscopic paths can never be 
recognized and observed.   
          The  particle  can  choose  one  path  from  the  infinite 
options  of  the  paths  consistent  with  the  magnitude  of 
fluctuation of microscopic space-time. But, it is impossible to 
predict which path from the potential paths is hypostatized, 
as  the  initial  conditions,  which  are  unpredictable  in  the 
macroscopic space-time, change the state of the fluctuations. 
And  then,  along  the  hypostatized  path  which  satisfies  the 
deterministic  equations  (45),  (46),  the  particle  moves  in  the 
microscopic  space-time.  On  the  case  of  one  particle  system, 
the observation to confirm which path is hypostatized gives 
the unavoidable interaction to the path. While on the other 
hand,  suppose  the  case  of  two  particles  system,  for  instant, 
the  splitting  of  one  particle  to  two  particles  A  and  B.  Both 
particles shall move a long distance in the counter direction 
after  the  splitting.  After  adequate  time,  if  the  physical 
quantity of either particle A is observed, the quantity of the 
other  particle  B  is  predicted  exactly.  Assuming  that  both 
particles  confirm  one  hypostatized  path  that  satisfies  the 
deterministic equations (45), (46) at the instant of the splitting, 
it is quite reasonable that the observation of the state of the 
either particle A determines the state of the other particle B. 
In  the  present  case,  the  action  at  a  distance  between  the 
observation of state of the particle A and the fixedness of the 
state  of  the  particle  B  is  never  required.  Considering  the 
particles can hypostatize one path from the infinite paths and 
move along the path, the ERP [6] paradox is nonexistent. The 
concept of the existence of infinite paths of the particle motion 
is  equivalent  to  the  quantum  mechanics  based  on  the  path 
integral by Feynman [7]. This paper advocates that the infinite 
paths are caused by the fluctuation on microscopic space-time. 
On that point, setting the reduction of wave pocket aside, this 
paper  never  disallows  the  standard  interpretation  of  the 
quantum  mechanics,  but  supplements  the  cause  of  the 
difference  with  the  classical  mechanics  and  the  quantum 
mechanics.   
          If  the  problem  of  the  two-slit  experiment  is  examined 
using the present interpretation, the particle never passes the 
two-slit,  and  should  pass  either  one  of  the  two.  Then,  the 
interaction  between  the  fluctuated  microscopic  space-time 
due to the particle motion and due to the potential of two-slit 
may  make  the  interference  of  the  fluctuations.  The 
interference which limit the path of particle, cause the fringe 
pattern  of  particle  position  on  the  screen.  Then,  there  is  no 
repugnance between the existence microscopic path and the 
figuration of the fringe pattern. The reduction of wave packet 
may be eliminated naturally.   
          This  interpretation  that  advocates  the  existence  of  the 
microscopic path resembles to the Nelson’s theory  [8]. It also 
can  derivate  the  Schrödinger  equation  using  stochastic

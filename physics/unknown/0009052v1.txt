Geometric relativistic interactions in a new geometric unified theory are classified using the dynamic holonomy
groups of the connection. Physical meaning may be given to these interactions if the frame excitations represent
particles. These excitations have algebraic and topological quantum numbers. The proton, electron and neutrino
may  be  associated  to  the  frame  excitations  of  the  three  dynamical  holonomy  subgroups.  In  particular,  the
proton  excitation  has  a  dual  mathematical  structure  of  a  triplet  of  subexcitations.  Hadronic,  leptonic  and
gravitational interactions correspond to the same subgroups. The background geometry determines non trivial
fiber  bundles  where  excitations  live,  introducing  topological  quantum  numbers  that  classify  families  of
excitations. From these particles, the only stable ones, it may be possible, as suggested by Barut, to build the
rest  of  the  particles.  The  combinations  of  the  three  fundamental  excitations  display  SU(3)SU(2)U(1)
symmetries.

1. Introduction.

The group of the geometric space-time structure of special relativity is fundamental to the field theories of
elementary particles, which are representations of this group. In contrast the geometry of general relativity has
not played such a fundamental role. Nevertheless, our geometric relativistic unified theory of gravitation and
electromagnetism may have non trivial applications for particle theory [1 ,2 ]. Here we discuss this question
using  groupal  and  geometric  features  and  ideas,  avoiding  unnecessary  aspects  that  may  present  obstacles  in
understanding the physical implications of the geometry for physical particles. The study of groups that act on
the geometric structures of a physical theory and their related symmetric spaces may display essential physical
features without actually solving the equations of the theory. We hope to show the relation of this particular
new approach in the treatment of elementary particles and their interactions, a geometric group realization as
fiber bundle sections, with the standard model [3 ,4 ].

It  is  well  known  that  the  holonomy  groups  of  a  connection  in  a  fiber  bundle  may  be  used  to  classify  its
possible connections. It is interesting to use this method to gain insight on the types of physical interactions
represented by the connection in the unified geometric theory.

In QFT certain particles are given masses by a Higgs mechanism  which relies on certain symmetries that
a vacuum solution may possess. This appears to assign to the vacuum a not completely passive role. We may try
to assign to the vacuum an even more active role. This is accomplished by recognizing that the particle vacuum
is a geometric space with physical meaning, related to a unified non linear geometric theory of physics. We
consider  an  approximation,  to  the  geometric  non  linear  theory,  where  the  microscopic  physical  objets  are
realized  as  linear  geometric  excitations  around  a  non  linear  substratum  geometric  space.  This  is  consistent
with the QFT interpretation of particles as vacuum excitations. We interpret the excitation as particles and the
substratum as the particle vacuum.

With this definition, a particle is acted upon by the substratum and is never really free except in absolute
empty space (zero substratum curvature). The substratum space carries the universal inertial properties. A free
particle is an idealization. In a fundamental level, if we accept physics in the substratum we are assuming, in
part, a (Parmenides) holistic principle which should be consistent with the ideas of Mach [5 ] and Einstein [6 ]
that assign fundamental importance of far-away matter in determining the inertial properties of local matter.
On the contrary, if we assume only particles we are assuming a (Democritus) atomistic principle. This implies
there is no physics in the substratum.

Restriction to holonomy subgroups has also implications for the equations of motion of matter, since within
the theory particles are represented by frame excitations (sections of a bundle). We may expect that the geomet-
ric association of frames to holonomy subgroups may naturally classify particles and associate them to interac-
tions. Hopes to accomplish this objectives are supported on results of recent previous work [7], [8], [9] which
we shall summarize as follows.

Constants  associated  to  the  substratum  connection  appear  as  constant  mass  parameters  in  the  excitation
equations and play a fundamental role. As in General Relativity, the covariant equations may be referred to
frames  (coordinates)  that  must  be  related  to  observers  determined  by  the  physical  experiment  in  question.
Otherwise theoretical results remain indeterminate. The freedom to choose an arbitrary reference frame by a
group transformation generates a class of equivalent solutions, linking relativistic interactions, represented by
one particular reference frame er.

Any excitation must be associated to a definite substratum. An arbitrary observation of an excitation prop-
erty depends on both the excitation and the substratum, but the physical observer must be the same for both
excitation and substratum. We may use the freedom to select the reference frame, to refer the excitation to the
physical frame defined by its own substratum, which satisfies the nonlinear equation,

∗

=Ω 4πα   .
Then  the  substratum  is  referred  to  itself  and  the  substratum  matter  frame  eb,  referred  to  er  becomes  the
group identity I. Actually this generalizes comoving coordinates (coordinates adapted to dust matter geode-
sics) [10 ]. We adopt coordinates adapted to local substratum matter frames (the only non arbitrary frame is

( 1.1)

3

itself).  Free  matter  shows  no  self  acceleration,  self  action.  In  its  own  reference  frame  these  effects  actually
disappear. Only constant self energy terms, determined by the nonlinearity of the substratum, make sense and
should be the origin of the constant mass parameter.

At a small distance λ, characteristic of free excitations, the connection and frame of the substratum appears
symmetric. Mathematically we should say that the substratum is a locally symmetric space [11 ] or hyperbolic
manifold [12 ]. We recognize the necessary condition that locally the substratum be a bundle that locally ad-
mits a maximal set of Killing vectors of the space time symmetry with null connection Lie derivative [13 ].
This means that there are space time Killing coordinates such that the connection is constant non zero in the
region of particle interest. (A flat connection is too strong assumption).

It is clear from the definition of excitation that a free particle (excitation) is a representation of the struc-
ture group of the theory and consequently an algebraic element. A representation (and therefore a particle) is
characterized by the eigenvalues of the Casimir operators. The state of a representation (particle) are charac-
terized by the eigenvalues of Cartan subspace basis operators. This provides a set of algebraic quantum num-
bers to the excitation. Of course, we must somehow choose the respective representations associated to these
particles. It has been indicated that the physical particles are representations of holonomy subgroups of SL(4,R)
induced from the subgroup SL(2,C), realized as functions on the coset spaces. In fact, it has been shown that
new  electromagnetic  consequences  of  this  theory  leads  to  quantization  of  electric  charge  and  magnetic  flux
[14 ], providing a plausible explanation for the fractional quantum Hall effect.

One important issue is: How do we calculate mass in a consistent manner? Mass arises from constants with
inverse length dimension corresponding to a symmetric substratum solution of the non linear field equation.
These constants appear in the linear excitation equations for a fermionic frame fluctuation δe and a bosonic
connection fluctuation W=δΓ, which are of the general form, in the defining representation,

If we consider geometric excitations on a substratum, these expressions may be expanded as a perturbation
around the substratum in terms of a small parameter ε, characterizing the excitation, indicating that the zeroth
order term, the bare mass, is given entirely by the substratum current and connection, with corrections depend-
ing on the excitation self interaction. As indicated in previous work [15 ], these corrections correspond to a
geometric quantum field theory.

In  this  manner,  the  particle  bare  mass  parameters  are  not  determined  from  the  linear  particle  equation
themselves,  but  rather  from  the  holistic  inertial  non  linear  substratum  solution.  The  existence  of  a  constant
connection  solution    [16 ]  for  these  asymptotic  fields  (free  particle  substratum)  provides  a  fundamental  dis-
tance, due to non linearity, and gives a mechanism to calculate mass ratios in terms of volumes of respective
symmetric coset spaces. The extreme case of absolute empty space that implies zero substratum curvature self
interaction,  is  only  mathematically  possible  in  this  theory  for  a  universe  without  matter,  because  of  the
nonlinearity of the substratum field equations.

Nevertheless, the association of a mass to one of these geometric distances remains arbitrary because this
association actually calibrates a geometric scale of distance in terms of a physical mass scale. Since mass is
inverse  length,  we  may  associate  a  “standard  physical  mass”  to  the  “standard  geometric  length”.  After  the
association we may attempt to calculate a ratio of masses. For example, if we select the mass of the proton
excitation to calibrate the geometric unit, we may calculate the mass of the electron excitation. The result of
this calculation, using the symmetric space quotients of holonomy groups and the constant substratum solution
is the ratio [17]

which essentially agrees with the experimental value and may lend credibility to this geometric theory.

2. Geometric Classification of the Connection.

In order to classify the relativistic interactions we look for dynamical holonomy groups H of the associated
connection. It is clear that H must be a subgroup of the structure group of the theory, SL(4,R), chosen to be the
simple group of automorphisms of the space time Clifford algebra.

From the geometric meaning of the algebra, the elements ±κ

a  are associated to triads of opposite orienta-
tion. In principle, both sets with opposite signs may be used as part of the orthonormal set κα of the algebra.
The arbitrary sign is determined by a standard relation of products of Pauli matrices, in terms of Hodge duality
ijk and Clifford (complex) duality i. We should adhere to the same convention in the choice of sign for the ±κ
ε
a.
The  standard  orientation  in  space  time  [u0,u1,u2,u3]  induces  an  orientation  in  the  geometric  algebra  which
κ
should be used to define the Clifford geometric duality κ
3. This four dimensional duality operation de-
noted by κ
5, and Hodge duality should relate the matrices representing the Pauli matrices within the algebra,
preserving  the  standard  relation.  Mathematically,

( 2.2)

The group SL(4,R) is generated by exponentiation of the 15 traceless matrices of a base in the Clifford algebra.
For physical reasons we want that the relativistic interactions be associated to a dynamic evolution of the
matter  sources.  The  dynamical  effects  are  produced  in  the  theory  by  the  action  of  the  group,  in  particular
accelerations should be produced by generators equivalent to the Lorentz boosts as seen by an observer. There-
fore,  we  require  that  the  boost  generators,  κ
κα,  be  present  in  a  connection  identifiable  with  a  dynamical
interaction as seen by the observer associated to the Minkowski subspace generated vectorially by κα. Because
of the nature of the source current,

which corresponds to the adjoint action of the group on the algebra, it should be clear that all generators of the
form κ
[ακβ] of SL(4,R) should be present in the dynamical holonomy group of a physical interaction connection.

Furthermore, H must be simple. The different possibilities may be obtained from the knowledge of the sub-
groups of G.

3. The group G itself.

The P subgroup is Sp(4,R), as may be verified by explicitly showing that the generators satisfy the simplectic
requirement [18 ]. This group is known to be homomorphic to SO(3,2), a De Sitter  group. The L subgroup is
Sp(2,C), isomorphic to SL(2,C). In addition there are only two simple compact subgroups of G, non dynami-
cal, generated by κ

Then we have only three possible dynamical holonomy groups: L, P, or G. For each case we have an equiva-
lence class of connections and a possible physical interaction within the theory. Other holonomy groups are not
dynamical, in the sense that they do not produce a geometrical accelerating action on matter, as determined by

an observer boost. This is the case of a U(1) holonomy subgroup which may represent electromagnetism but
does not provide, by its direct action, a geometric dynamics (force) on charged matter. The dynamics requires
a separate Lorenz force postulate.
Since L⊂P⊂G, this scheme allows us to classify interactions geometrically in increasing order of complex-
ity. This group chain has a symmetry because there is no unique way of identifying LG and LP. The coset
G/L represents how many equivalent L subgroups are in G. There is also an equivalence relation R among the
non compact generators of G, all of them equivalent to a boost generator or space-time external symmetry. The
subspace obtained as the quotient of G/L by this relation is the internal symmetry group of LG,

Similarly the coset P/L gives, as the internal symmetry of LP, the group

( 2.5)

( 2.6)

The total internal symmetry of the chain LPG is the product of the two groups SU(2)U(1) which coin-
cides with the symmetry group of the weak interactions. There is no geometrical reason to identify the struc-
ture group of the theory with the symmetry group because they are different geometrical concepts. At the end
we shall come back to discuss the physical significance of this symmetry.

3. Subexcitations Corresponding to Subgroups.

If we restrict the group to either the P or L subgroups, the corresponding frame matrices (subframes) are
elements of the subgroup. The total frame f, which is an element a of the algebra, decomposes into even and
odd parts in accordance with the general Clifford algebra decomposition,

implying that a frame for a massive particle must have odd and even parts. In our case, if we set f- equal to zero
we obtain also that  m is zero. Therefore, for an L-subframe we have multiplying by κ0  ,
σ ∂µ

µ f + = 0  ,

the equation of the neutrino as discussed before.

If an excitation corresponds to a representation of a subgroup with specific quantum numbers, it may be
associated to only one of the spinor columns of the frame, the one with the corresponding quantum numbers.
Accordingly, we restrict the fluctuations of frames to matrices that have only one column in each of the two
parts of the frame, the even η and the odd ξ.

We have that the left handed component is equivalent to the η field which in turn is defined in terms of the
even f+ field. Similarly, we see that the right handed component is equivalent to the ξ field and consequently to
the odd f- field. Therefore, an even frame corresponds to a left handed particle, as should be for a neutrino. The
Lorentz frame excitation has neutrino like properties. It is necessary to point out that, since the mass in this
equation is zero, Wigner’s little group, which preserves the momentum k, is ISO(2) instead of SO(3) corre-
sponding  to  massive  particles.  The  induced  representations  of  the  neutrino  excitation  are  sections  over  the
light 3-hypercone valued in representations of ISO(2) and are characterized by the value of helicity.

A general Sp(4,R) excitation has a κ0 generator, which is an electromagnetic generator. We expect that this
excitation should represent a particle with one quantum of charge and one quantum of spin. The component of
the  current  along  this  generator  coincides  with  the  standard  electric  current  [19]   in  quantum  mechanics.  In
addition, it was shown that the general perturbation technique for the interaction of the electron and neutrino
fields lead, essentially, to the current and Lagrangian assumed in Fermi’s theory of weak interactions [20]  of
leptons. This lead to the conjecture that a Sp(4,R) excitation may represent an electron. With this in mind, the
value of the ratio of the proton to electron masses was derived from the definition of mass in terms of energy as
indicated in a previous section, using the properties of the structure group and its subgroups and respective
cosets in the theory.

It is possible to define the eigenvalue of the odd operator in the geometric algebra as a quantum number
called  oddity.  Furthermore,  transformations  by  the  subgroup  SL(2,C)  leave  invariant  the  even  and  odd  sub-
spaces of a frame. Since these eigenspaces correspond to the left handed and right handed parts, or equivalent
to the helicity eigenvalues, it is clear that, within a Sp(4,R) frame, eL may be assigned a ν
L partner and may be
considered a doublet, under another group, while eR has no ν
R partner and may be considered a singlet. This
indicates a possible link with the standard model of weak interactions.

equations, together with the non linear field equation should have a substratum state solution. Then we may
associate an excitation to each class of frames around the substratum solution. This excitations are elements of
the Lie algebra of the structure group of the theory.

It is clear that X1, and X2 are compact generators and therefore have imaginary eigenvalues. Because of the
way they were constructed, they should be associated, respectively, to the z-component of angular momentum
and the electric charge.  Both of them may be diagonalized simultaneously in terms of their imaginary eigen-
values.

two excitation states of positive charge with two excitation states of negative charge. The presence of opposite
charges in a representation forces us to make a clarification. To avoid confusion we should restrict the term
(charge) conjugation to indicate the original Dirac operation to relate states of opposite charge.

There  is  also  another  fundamental  representation  f

∼
  dual  to  f  and  of  the  same  dimensions,  with  all  signs
reversed, which is inequivalent to the original one and represented by the inverted tetrahedron in the Cartan
subspace. One of the two representations is arbitrarily assigned to represent the physical excitation. The math-
ematics of the representation algebra indicates that a state may also be described as composed of 3 members of
its  dual  representation.  In  turn,  the  dual  representation  may  also  be  similarly  described  as  composed  of  3
members of its dual, which is the original representation. This mutual mathematical decomposition is reminis-
cent of the idea of “nuclear democracy” proposed in the 1960’s [22 ] but restricted to dual representations. To
avoid confusion we restrict the use of the term duality to relate these inequivalent representations.

In standard particle language the antiparticle is the dual particle which implies also the conjugate particle.
Nevertheless, this assignment of a physical particle/antiparticle pair to the fundamental representation and its
inequivalent  dual  is  not  a  mathematical  implication  of  standard  particle  theory,  only  a  physical  assumption.
Since  our  fundamental  representation  includes  opposite  charges  it  is  not  appropriate  to  consider  the  dual
representation  as  antiparticles.  We  may,  as  well,  simply  say  that  the  antiparticle  is  related  to  the  conjugate
particle. The dual particle is just a necessary dual mathematical structure.
We have then for a particular state p of the fundamental representation,

It does not follow that the q necessarily are states of a different physical excitation, only that the q form a
dual  triplet  mathematical  representation  of  the  p  representing  the  same  excitation.  This  allows  a  different
physical  interpretation  for  these  mathematical  constructions.  It  should  be  noted  that  all  p,  q  have  electric
charge equal to the geometric unit, electron charge ±e. Since these excitations have particle properties, there is
a dual mathematical representation of the physical excitation (particle). We may raise the following question?
What  happens  if  we  physically  identify  p  with  the  proton,  which  mathematically    may  be  expressed  as  3 q,
interpreted as quarks? In our theory there is no need to assign fractional charges to quarks. In accordance with
the  “restricted  nuclear  democracy”  we  may  assume  that  the  quark  states,  in  turn,  may  be  mathematically
expressed as 3 protons p, which may justify the large experimental mass of these states.

Similarly the subspace Sp(4,R)/SU(2)U(1) is a 6-dimensional Riemannian space of the non compact type.
The complementary subspace within SL(4,R)/SU(2)SU(2) is 3-dimensional. There is a triple infinity of these
subspaces within the total space, reflecting the triple infinity of groups P in G, depending on the choice of an
electromagnetic generator among the three possible ones in SU(2).

( 4.7)

In Sp(4,R)/SU(2)U(1), with a fixed electromagnetic generator, we have a vector in the odd sector, repre-
senting a momentum k associated to an excitation e. Since we have this situation in SL(4,R)/SU(2)SU(2) for
each  generator  in  SU(2),  we  have,  in  effect,  3  momenta,  ki,  that  may  characterize  an  excitation  p.  We  must
consider excitations characterized by 3 momenta, ki, which may be interpreted as three subexcitations.
The  3  momenta,  ki,  of  the  three  subexcitations  characterize  the  protonic  frame  excitation  p,  but  neither
those of e nor those of ν. Mathematically what we have is a system characterized by 3 momenta, ki, that may be
scattered into another system of 3 momenta, kj’. Could this be interpreted as a 3-point particle? It should be
expected that a scattering analysis of excitations must include three momenta in some δ functions that appear
in the scattering results. Experimentally, at high energies, this should appear as a collision with a system of
three point like particles. Again, this could be interpreted as three partons (quarks) inside the proton. In any
case, it is clear that a point like proton excitation is not predicted by our theory.

5. Physical Interpretation in Terms of Particles and Relativistic inter-
actions.

We have found properties of the geometric excitations which are particle like. We take the position that this
is no coincidence but indicates a geometrical structure for physics. The source current J depends on a frame.
To each holonomy group we may associate a class of frames thus giving three classes of matter.

As already discussed in section 3, the corresponding L-frame represents a zero mass, neutral, spin ½, left

handed geometric excitation, which obeys eq. ( 3.4), and has the particle properties of the neutrino.

For the P-connection, the corresponding P-frame represents a massive, opposite charge -1, spin ½, geomet-

ric point like excitation which has the properties of the electron [23 ].

For the G-connection the corresponding G-frame should be a massive, charge 1, spin ½, 3-point geometric

excitation, with a bare mass of 1836.12 times the electron mass which we conjecture is the proton.

In this manner, we have associated to each of the three holonomy groups, one of the only three known stable

particles.

For the L-connection it is not difficult to recognize that the interaction is gravitation, from the discussion in
previous chapters and the work of Carmelli [24 ]. Similarly, it also was shown in previous work that electro-
magnetism (without dynamics) is associated to one of the SU(2) generators and that the physical Fermi weak
interaction is related to the odd sector of a P-connection.

We propose here that the P/L generators may be interpreted as an electroweak interaction and the G/P as
strong nuclear interaction. Then the three dynamic holonomy classes of connections may correspond to three
classes of relativistic interactions as follows:

1. The L-connection describes gravitational interaction;
2. The P-connection describes coupled gravitational and electroweak interactions;
3. The G-connection describes coupled gravitational, electroweak and strong interactions.

10

The L-frames obey equations that may be obtained from the general equations of motion when the frame e
has only the even part e+. From the field equation it is seen that a P-frame generates a P-connection and that a
G-frame generates a G-connection.

From this classification it follows, in agreement with the physical interactions that:

1. All (matter) frames self interact gravitationally;
2. L-frames self interact only gravitationally (uncharged matter);
3. G-frames (hadrons) are the only frames that self interact strongly (hadronic matter);
4. G-frames self interact through all three interactions;
5. G-frames (hadronic matter) and P-frames (leptonic matter) self interact electroweakly and gravita-

tionally;

6. P-frames self interact gravitationallly an electroweakly but not strongly (leptonic matter).

6. Particle Families.

The framework of this theory is compatible with a phenomenological classification of particles in a manner

similar to what is normally done with the standard symmetry groups.

First we should notice that the theory suggests naturally three stable ground particles (ν, e, p). In fact, if we
consider  the  possibility  of  different  levels  of  excited  states,  each  particle  may  generate  a  class  of  unstable
particles or resonances.

In particular, since the equations for each of the three particle classes are the same, differing only in the
subgroup that applies, it may be expected that there is some relation among corresponding levels of excitations
for each class, forming families.

The  ratio  of  the  mass  of  the  hadron  in  the  ground  level  family  (proton)  to  the  mass  of  the  lepton  in  the
ground  level  family  (electron)  has  been  calculated  from  the  ratio  of  volumes  of  coset  spaces  based  on  the
existence  of  a  trivial  non  zero  constant  solution  for  the  substratum  connection.  This  trivial  solution  is  the
representative of a class of equivalent solutions generated by the action of the structure group.

Now consider only topological properties, independent of the connection, of the space of complete solutions
(substratum  plus  excitation  solutions).  An  incoming  scattering  solution  is  a  jet  bundle  local  section,  over  a
world tube in the space time base manifold, that describes the evolution of the solution in terms a time like
parameter τ from past infinity to some finite time t. Similarly, an outgoing solution is a local section from time
t to future infinity. The local sections in the bundle represent classes of solutions relative to local observers.
Scattering solutions at infinity are asymptotically free excitation solutions around a substratum. The substrata
(incoming and outgoing) are equivalent to each other and to the constant trivial solution if we choose observer
frames adapted to the substrata.

, so the initial hypersurface  1

Since the equations are of hyperbolic type, we should provide initial conditions on an initial 3 dimensional
. The sections of interest are the three fundamental excitations. We require that
hypersurface at past infinity 1
, reduce to a free excitation around the trivial sub-
all incoming solutions, at the past infinity hypersurface  1
(∞). Since the incoming solution substrata
stratum solution at the two dimensional spatial infinity subspace 1
(∞), we may treat this spatial infinity as a
are equivalent to the trivial substratum solution at spatial infinity1
single point, thus realizing a single point compactification of  1
 is homeomor-
phic to S3. All incoming solutions on 1
 are classified by the functions over S3. The same requirements may be
applied to the outgoing remote future solutions and, in fact, to any solution along an intermediate 3 dimen-
sional hypersurface, a section of the world tube. Thus, the final hypersurface at future infinity 1
 is also homeo-
morphic to S3. The incoming and outgoing substratum local sections over 1
 must be pasted together in
some  common  region  around  the  present  t,  by  the  transition  functions  of  the  bundle.  All  generators  of  the
group produce a transformation to a different, but equivalent under the group, expression for the solution. If
the holonomy group of the solution is not the whole group, there is a reference frame that reduces the structure
group to the particular  holonomy subgroup. But in general for arbitrary observer, there are solutions formally
generated  by  SL(4,R).  Since  this  transition  region,  the  “equator”,  has  the  topology  of  S3×R,  the  transition
functions ϕ define a mapping, at the τ=0 hypersurface,
ϕ:
which is classified by the third homotopy group [25 ] of the structure group SL(4,R) or the respective holonomy
subgroup.  There  are  some  solutions  not  deformable  to  the  trivial  solution  by  a  homeomorphism  because  ϕ

Similarly, we have for the homotopy groups of the other two holonomy groups,

SL C
These scattering solutions are characterized by topological quantum integral numbers n, for the three groups,
and m only for group G, called winding numbers. In all cases the scattering solutions are characterized by one
topological winding number n and in particular the hadronic scattering solutions have an additional topologi-
cal winding number m. This result implies that there are solutions ω
n, en that are not homotopically equivalent
to ω
0, e0.
All p, e, ν  excitation solutions with a given n may be associated among themselves because of the isomor-
phism of the homotopy groups Z. This is an equivalence relation. Two p, e, ν excitation with the same n are in
the same topological class determined by the substratum. Each topological class, characterized by the topologi-
cal quantum number n defines a physical class, a family of particles with the same winding number, which is
respected by transitions the same as the algebraic quantum numbers s, q, f.

7. Relation with Barut’s Model.

Since in our geometric theory the only constant that enters is α, the ratio of the masses of the excited states
and the fundamental state should depend on this constant. It is possible that the geometric theory may provide
an explanation for the interesting approximate relation of the masses of the leptons and the electron,

( 7.9)

This equation was proposed by Barut [29 ] with n interpreted as the number of  νν  pairs. Although this

12

interpretation is also characterized by the group Z, it is not clear whether both interpretations are compatible.
In any case, the possibility exists that there be excited states which may be interpreted as a particle com-
posed  of  p,  e  and  ν  .  As  a  matter  of  fact  Barut  has  suggested  that  the  muon  should  be  considered  as  an
electromagnetic excitation of the electron. Although the details should be different, because Barut’s approach
is only electromagnetic in nature and ours is a unified interaction, we may conjecture also that the muon is an
excited electron state with a leptonic winding number n=1. Similarly the τ would be an excitation with wind-
ing number n=2.

Having a possible scheme for the geometric origin of the muon, it is possible that the process of building
other  particles  as  suggested  by  Barut  [30 ,31 ,32 ]  may  be  accomplished  in  terms  of  the  stable  articles,  the
electron, the proton and the neutrino together with the muon.

In  order  to  adapt  our  geometric  model  to  Barut’s  model  we  establish  that  the  quantum  numbers  of  an
excitation  correspond  to  the  quantum  numbers  of  its  stable  components  (p,  e, ν).  In  this  manner,  following
Barut’s ideas, we define the charge of an excitation as the number of protons minus the number of electrons
contained in the excitation,

theories. If this were the case, (this has to be shown) the non relativistic effective potential would be [33 ]

The  full  frame  excitation  has  proton  like  properties.  Of  course,  within  the  geometric  theory  the  quark
excitations are not the fundamental building blocks of matter. They are only approximate subexcitations that
are useful and necessary in describing a series of hadronic excitations.

8. Relation with the Standard Model.

We  have  replaced  the  space  time  related  structure  group,  fundamental  to  the  theory,  by  using  SL(4,R)
instead of SO(3,1). On top of this geometry, as is done in the standard model over the geometry of standard
special relativity, it is possible to add a related structure to help in the understanding of the physical particles.
It  is  known  that  heavy  nuclei  may  be  partially  understood  by  using  groups  SU(N),  U(N),  O(N)  to  associate
protons and neutrons in a dynamic symmetric or supersymmetric manner [34 ]. This is essentially the use of
group  theory  to  study  the  combinations  of  the  two  building  blocks,  protons  and  neutrons,  assumed  to  form
nuclei. In the same manner we may use certain groups to describe the combinations of the three fundamental
geometrical building blocks introduced by the physical geometry, protons, electrons and neutrinos, assuming
they form other particles.

We are interested in how to combine G, P and L excitations. This is accomplished by attaching L excita-

tions to P excitations and then to G excitations. This combination may not be done uniquely, rather it depends
on the identification of a subgroup H with a subspace in the group fiber bundle space  G. Any non compact
generator is equivalent to a boost, by the adjoint action of a compact generator. Thus, the compact generators
generate a symmetry of the combination of excitations.

In particular, the identification of L within P is not unique. The group L may be expressed as the principal
bundle (L,3B,S), where the fiber S is the SU(2)R associated to rotations and  3B is the three dimensional boost

The choice of the boost sectors of L and P sector inside G depends on the action of the SU(2) in the fiber of G,
generated  by  the  compact  electromagnetic  generators.  Mathematically  this  corresponds  to  the  action  of  all
compact generators in the quotient G/L. The total symmetry of first identifying LGP and then (LGP)GG is the
product of the two groups. Therefore, there is a symmetry action of a group equal to SU(2)U(1), but different
to the subgroups of G, on the identification of the subgroups in the chain LGPGG.

There is an induced symmetry on the combination of L and P subexcitations on G excitations corresponding
to this SU(2)U(1) symmetry. The action of this combinatorial group may be interpreted as the determination
of the possible combinations of L and P excitations to give flavor to states of G and P excitations and thus
related to the weak interactions.

This SU(2)F group relates electron equivalent P-excitation states or neutrino equivalent L-excitation states.
Clearly at sufficiently high energies the mass of any excitation kinematically appears very small and its effects
on results are small deviations from those of a zero mass excitation that always corresponds to an excitation of
the even subgroup or L-excitation. For this reason, at high energies, the even part (left handed part) of a P-
excitation  may  be  related  to  an  even  L-excitation  by  an  SU(2)  transformation.  Both  corresponding  physical
leptonic excitations, the even part e+ or e0 and ν, may be considered members of a doublet, labeled by oddity 0
or weak hypercharge -1, while the odd part e- or e1 is a singlet labeled by oddity 1 or weak hypercharge -2. This
weak  interaction  association  of  leptons  into  hypercharged  states  has  the  approximate  symmetry  SU(2)F.  In

16

addition, there is an undetermined orientation of L1 inside G that depends of the action of SU(2)U(1). Under
this approach, the standard physical electromagnetic potential A, the connection of U+(1) in SL1(2,C), has an
orientation angle within the chiral SU(2)U(1).

Since our description may be made in terms of the proton representation or, alternately, in terms of its dual
quark representation as indicated in section 4, we could obtain complementary dual realizations of the rela-
tions among different experimental results. These are really different perceptions or pictures of the same physical
reality  of  matter.  The  proton  or  G-excitation  has  a  quark  structure:  it  behaves  as  if  formed  by  three  points.
Using the quark representation to build other particles, we may consider that in G the 3 quark states span a 2
dimensional  Cartan  A2  subspace.  There  is  a  combinatorial  unitary  symmetry,  SU(3),  related  to  this  Cartan
subspace,  that  may  be  interpreted  as  the  color  of  the  combinations  of  states  of G  and  thus  related  to  strong
interactions. States of G-excitations display an SU(3)C symmetry.

In this manner, the physical geometry determines an approximate combinatorial internal symmetry charac-

terized by the combinatorial symmetry group SC.

If the probability of combination is propagated infinitesimally by a connection, we have the elements of a high
energy quasi standard model. At high energies we may expect the appearance of resonances with high masses.
Of course, in order to get the electromagnetic potential at low energy, the chiral part of the phenomenological
combinatorial internal symmetry should be broken.

( )

( 8.5)

The standard model is built from certain general features of experimental and theoretical results. In par-
ticular  the  SU(3)  transformation  among  a  triplet  of  components,  the  quark-parton  model  [35 ,36 ],  and  the
SU(2)L transformation of the chiral parts of a doublet, the electroweak theory [37 ,38 ], are the starting points
of the model. Since these features are present in the physical geometry, as shown here and in sections 3 and 4,
we have the real possibility of building an approximate “quasi standard model” on top of our geometry. The
combinatorial groups actually relate discrete asymptotic, in or out, states in a scattering theory of excitations.
It  is  possible,  in  an  approximate  way,  to  “gauge”  these  groups  to  obtain  an  approximate  dynamic  theory.
Theoretically, the infinitesimal evolution of physical systems or dynamics is determined by the generators of
SL(4,R) in accordance with the equations of the theory, but the scattering solutions should show symmetries
related to the combinatorial group.

In  this  manner,  this  approximate  construction  should  share  certain  features  and  results  with  the  standard
model while there would be differences in some other features. Due to the vastness of particle physics experi-
mental results, it is not clear, at this time, how these differences would compare with experiments, in particu-
lar because the geometrical ideas may introduce a rearrangement of experimental results. This actually repre-
sents a program to be carried out. It is true that the standard model has led to success, but this does not imply
there is no better way of reordering the physical results.

Summary.

The geometric unified  theory discussed represents relativistic interactions that may be classified into three
classes by the dynamical holonomy groups of the possible physical connections. The three classes correspond
to gravitation, electro-weak and strong physical interactions.

Solutions to the three corresponding frame excitation  equations representing matter, show algebraic and
topological quantum numbers. Using them and previously calculated mass ratios, we are able to identify three
classes of fundamental excitations, corresponding to the three stable physical particles (neutrino, electron and
proton). The algebraic numbers correspond to electric charge, spin and magnetic flux. The leptonic and had-
ronic  topological  quantum  winding  numbers  correspond  to  higher  levels  of  excitation,  defining  families  for
each integer. The interactions felt by these excitations conform with the general classification scheme of par-
ticles into neutrinos, leptons and hadrons. The combinations of the three particles display an SU(3)SU(2)U(1)
symmetry. A program to establish the relation of the theory with the standard model of particles was outlined.

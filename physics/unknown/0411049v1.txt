We  address  soliton  spiraling  in  optical  lattices  induced  by  multiple  coherent  Bessel 

beams  and  show  that  the  dynamical  nature  of  such  lattices  make  them  able  to  drag 

different  soliton  structures,  setting  them  into  rotation.  The  rotation  rate  can  be 

controlled by varying the topological charges of lattice-inducing Bessel beams.

Light propagation in media with modulated refractive index exhibits a variety of 

unique  phenomena.  When  the  modulation  forms  an  array  of  evanescently  coupled 

waveguides, discrete solitons appear as excitations of a few guides.1 Discrete solitons can 

move across the array, a phenomenon accompanied by radiation but with important all-

optical  routing  applications.  Tuning  the  depth  of  the  refractive-index  modulation  is  a 

powerful  tool  to  control  the  soliton  mobility.2  Such  tunable  lattices  can  be  generated 

optically in photorefractive media.3-6 

 

To  date,  soliton  mobility  has  been  analyzed  in  lattices  that  keep  their  shape 

invariant along the longitudinal direction. In this Letter we explore, for the first time to 

our knowledge, optically induced lattices whose shape evolves dynamically. In particular, 

we address a phenomenon of soliton spiraling in a lattice that drags solitons into rotary 

motion. Such lattices can be generated by the interference of several Bessel beams.7 The 

resulting  refractive-index  modulation  produces  guiding  structures  that  resemble  optical 

fibers  with  a  varying  shape.  However,  the  possibility  to  reconfigure  and  optically  tune 

properties of such structures is a central point of the concept described here. We discuss 

the impact of lattice strength on soliton motion as well as the possibility of controlling 

the soliton rotation rate by changing topological charges of lattice-creating beams.

.  Even  though  the  induced  refractive  index  modulation 

rot

decreases as  r

→ ∞

 we use the term optical lattice to stress a possibility to reconfigure 

it all-optically. Notice that the infinite extent of harmonic lattices is only important in 

linear  propagation,  when  many  lattice  sites  are  occupied,  in  contrast  to  the  nonlinear 

case addressed here. 

To  study  the  soliton  dragging  we  fixed  the  charge  n

1=

  and  varied  m .  For 

2m =

 the twisted lattice has one clearly pronounced guiding channel (Fig. 1(a)); in that 

 

 

 

 

 

2

case we set the input field distribution in the form of a single soliton supported by the 

lattice  at 

ξ =

0

.  Such  beam  would  propagate  undistorted  in  the  non-rotating  lattice. 

The soliton beam is characterized by its energy flow U . Narrow solitons cease to feel the 

lattice  and  their  energy  flow  approaches  that  of  Townes  solitons:  U

5.85=

.  In  the 

max

twisted  dynamical  lattices  such  beams  are  no  longer  stationary,  but  for  deep  enough 

lattices they can be set into steady spiral motion with a period dictated by the period of 

the lattice rotation (Fig. 1). Such soliton motion is conceptually different from previous 

works on soliton steering and spiraling,

10,11 since here the otherwise immobile solitons are 

dragged by the dynamical lattice. We found that solitons can follow the lattice for huge 

distances, exceeding any feasible crystal length and undergo thousands of rotations. The 

location of the soliton peak amplitude exhibits small oscillations inside a rotating guiding 

channel of the lattice (Fig. 1). In the case of a lattice-creating beam with charge  m

3=

 

(Fig. 2), two pronounced guiding channels can be used to drag more complicated soliton 

structures such as dipole-mode solitons. We have found the input profile of dipole-mode 

soliton  as  exact  solution  of  Eq.  (1)  at 

ξ =

0

.  The  limiting  energy  flow  for  existence  of 

dipole-mode solitons is given by  2

maxU

 and close to this value the dipole-mode solitons 

transform into two narrow and almost non-interacting solitons. Dipole-mode soliton are 

also set into rotary motion by the lattice (Fig. 2). Besides dipole-mode soliton the lattice 

shown in Fig. 2 can drag single soliton located in either of two guiding sites. 

To  show  that  nonlinearity  is  essential  for  steady  soliton  spiraling  we  compared 

propagation  of  identical  beams  in  the  lattice  shown  in  Fig.  1  with  and  without 

nonlinearity (Fig. 3(a), (b)). In the linear regime radiation losses grow dramatically, the 

beam  broadens  and  is  redistributed  between  secondary  lattice  rings,  thus  quickly 

spreading after several lattice rotations. In the nonlinear regime the radiation is orders of 

magnitude  smaller.  To  quantify  the  radiation  rate  we  calculated  the  energy  flow  U  

ξ

concentrated in a close proximity of main guiding lattice sites (within the ring shown by 

dashed lines in Figs. 1(a), 2(a)) for different propagation distances (Fig. 4(a)). Radiation 

rate is larger during several initial rotations but it drastically reduces with increase of 

ξ

, 

and beyond  ξ

=

150

 the total radiative losses over a hundred diffraction lengths (around 

50 rotations) amount to about one percent. Similar result was obtained for dipole-mode 

solitons dragged by the lattice shown in Fig. 2. 

 

3

We also found that the radiation rate decreases with growth of the lattice depth 

and the input soliton energy flow. To quantify this effect we set the criterion that soliton 

is  captured  by  the  lattice  when  radiative  losses  after  one  rotation  (for  dipole-mode 

soliton  after  one  self-replication  period)  amount  to  less  than  5%.  Since  losses  decrease 

monotonically with increase of the input energy flow, this enables to define the critical 

energy  level U .  The  critical  energy  decreases  with  growth  of  the  lattice  depth  (Figs. 

cr

4(b) and 4(c)). This implies that deep enough lattices become totally trapping and can 

drag even low-energy beams. However, here we only interested in parameter range where 

nonlinearity really affects dragging properties of the lattice as it is shown in Figs. 3(a) 

and 3(b). Note that typically at U

crU≈

 nonlinearity strength is comparable with that 

of the lattice. With decrease of lattice depth U  approaches U  for single solitons and 

max

cr

2U

max

 for dipole-mode solitons. This implies that below certain critical value of 

p

, the 

lattice  may  be  unable  to  trap  and  drag  solitons.  This  critical  value  ( ∼   for  rapidly 

18

rotating lattices considered here) is reduced considerably for lattices with lower rotation 

rates  formed  by  broader  Bessel  beams.  The  maximal  rotation  rate  of  twisted  lattice  is 

dictated by the minimal achievable size of the core of lattice-creating beam, which is of 

the order of wavelength. Lattices created with such beams are expected to perform tens 

of rotations per millimeter. 

 

A key result is that by changing the topological charge of one of lattice-creating 

beams,  it  is  possible  to  control  the  rotation  rate  of  the  lattice,  and,  hence,  the  output 

soliton position at a given propagation length (Fig. 4(d)). Besides changing the rotation 

rate,  an  increase  of  the  topological  charge  m   results  in  more  complex  refractive  index 

distributions (Fig. 3(c),(d)). Such lattices can trap and drag soliton complexes composed 

from several bright spots as well as single beams located in either of guiding channels of 

the structure. 

 

In  conclusion,  the  results  reported  here  introduce  an  important  new  concept  for 

soliton control. The new scheme is based on the dragging of different soliton structures 

that  is  caused  by  dynamically  varying  optical  lattices  made  by  multiple  interfering 

Bessel beams. The approach has several control parameters, including the depth of the 

lattice, and the topological charge of the lattice-creating beams.

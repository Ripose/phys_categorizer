Abstract 

We  suggest  a  novel  method  for  injection of  electrons into the  acceleration phase of 

particle  accelerators,  producing  low  emittance  beams  appropriate  even  for  the 

demanding high energy Linear Collider specifications. In this paper we work out the 

injection  into  the  acceleration  phase  of  the  wake  field  in  a  plasma  behind  a  high 

intensity laser pulse, taking advantage of the laser polarization and focusing. With the 

aid of catastrophe theory we categorize the injection dynamics. The scheme uses the 

structurally stable regime of transverse wake wave breaking, when electron trajectory 

self-intersection  leads  to  the  formation  of  a  flat  electron  bunch.  As  shown  in  three-

dimensional  particle-in-cell  simulations  of  the  interaction  of  a  laser  pulse  in  a  line-

focus with an underdense plasma, the electrons, injected via the transverse wake wave 

breaking  and  accelerated  by  the  wake  wave,  perform  betatron  oscillations  with 

different  amplitudes  and  frequencies  along  the  two  transverse  coordinates.  The 

polarization  and  focusing  geometry  lead  to  a  way  to  produce  relativistic  electron 

bunches with asymmetric emittance (flat beam). An approach for generating flat laser 

accelerated ion beams is briefly discussed.

1. Introduction  

Electron  accelerators  with  energies  of  many  GeV  and  low  emittance  are  needed  for  coherent 

light sources and linear colliders. The laser acceleration of charged particles provides a promising 

approach  toward  such  development  in  a  compact  way,  avoiding  some  of  the  complications  which 

arise for the additional requirements of asymmetric emittance for linear colliders, as outlined below. 

In the Laser Wake Field Accelerator (LWFA), concept electrons are accelerated by the longitudinal 

electric  field  created  in  an  underdense  plasma  by  a  high  intensity  short  pulse  laser  [1].  Electrons 

injected  by  conventional  accelerators,  or  self-injected  by  nonlinear  wakewave  breaking  (see  for 

details  a  review  article  [2]  and  literature  therein)  achieve  energies  substantially  higher  than  the 

initial injection energies. Although the understanding and production of high intensity ( ºnC) and 

low emittance (≈ 2-3 mm mrad) electron beams via laser plasma interaction has made rapid progress 

in recent years [3,4-7], applications to coherent light sources and linear colliders still demand further 

advances. A symmetric emittance of about 1mm-mrad is needed for coherent light sources to reach 

X-ray  wavelengths  of  1  Ångstrom  [8].  Linear  electron-positron  сolliders  need  asymmetric 

emittances and polarized electrons, with the smaller vertical emittance required to be of the order of 

0.1  mm-mrad.  The  asymmetric  emittances  (flat  beam1)  are  needed  to  reduce  the  beam  induced 

synchrotron  radiation  (beamstrahlung)  in  the  interaction  (see  below),  and  electron  polarization  is 

required because the effective luminosity can be up to 2 orders of magnitude larger (depending on 

the  process),  as  shown  by  the  SLD  experiment  at  the  Stanford  Linear  Collider  (SLC)  [9]. 

Additionally,  positron  beam  polarization  is  desirable  because  certain  processes  can  be  measured 

with  higher  signal-to-noise  ratio  due  to  the  additional  positron  polarization,  and  it  enables  the 

                                                 
1 This paper addresses both laser-plasma and accelerator physics issues. One frequent confusion in the nomenclature is 
the  use  of  the  term  “flat  beam”.  In  accelerator  physics  flat  beam  means  an  asymmetric  spot  size  (created  with  an 
asymmetric  emittance).  In  laser  physics  a  flat  beam  is  one  with  a  large  focal  length,  and  the  means  to  achieve  an 
asymmetric spot size is a “line focus”.

measurement  of  transverse  cross  sections  [10].    The  capability  to  selectively  suppress  unwanted 

background processes is especially desired in search for new physics. 

With  the  near-term  aim  of  producing  1  GeV  range  laser  accelerated  electron  bunches,  a  more 

quantitative  evaluation  of  differing  requirements  of  major  applications  using  GeV  electrons  is  in 

order. These requirements include, in order of rising beam quality, 1) fixed target – electron beam 

interactions, 2) synchrotron and coherent light sources and 3) the colliding electron (positron) beam 

configurations:  

1.  For  fixed  target  applications  the  electron  beam  emittance  is  less  important  because  the 

luminosity  is  determined  by  the  beam  charge  and  the  target  thickness  [11].  In  this 

application the electron polarization can play a role and enhance the effective luminosity.  

2.  In case of the GeV electron beam  usage for  coherent light sources, e. g. for linac light 

sources, low emittance is important, because radiation from a high emittance beam fails 

to be coherent. This application requires small emittances, of the order of 1 mm-mrad for 

1Å wavelength, but a small spot size is not necessary. 

3.  For colliding electron beams, the emittance determines the minimum achievable spot size, 

i.e. it is directly related to the maximum luminosity. Depending on the electron energy, 

one needs a spot size approximately equal to 400 nm for 100 GeV electrons, and 5 nm 

(small  dimension)  in  the  case  of  the  1  TeV  collider  [12].  Required  for  colliders  in 

addition are the electron beam polarization (80% or more) and flat beams with an aspect 

ratio  of  about  100,  in  order  to  reduce  beamstrahlung  losses  and  electron-positron  pair 

production [9,13].  

The  conditions  to  have  beams  of  high  electric  charge  and  low  emittance  are  contradictory, 

because space charge effects make the transverse emittance grow [14]. The emittance is calculated 

as a product of the spot size, σx, and the divergence, σx′, both determined at a beam waist (or a pin 

 

3

hole), i.e. the transverse emittance is ε = σx σx′. In addition, the normalized emittance, defined as εN 

= γeε, is an adiabatic invariant under beam acceleration, where γe is the electron relativistic gamma 

factor. The values of emittance quoted earlier refer to the normalized emittances.  

If  we  consider  LWFA  produced  electrons,  we  see  femtosecond  range  electron  bunches 

accelerated to hundreds of MeV, and driven out of the plasma [3]. The energy spectrum is a quasi-

mono-energetic  form  [4-7,15],  which  is  mainly  related  to  the  fact  that  fast  electrons  reach  the 

maximum energy and are localized at the top of the separatrix in the x,px phase plane [16-18]. We 

remark two properties of LWFA ejected relativistic electrons: a) the product of the bunch length and 

the  energy  spread,  the  longitudinal  emittance,  is  comparable  to  conventional  RF  sources  (in  the 

range of MeV-ps), while the very short bunch length is achieved even without bunch compression, 

and b) the micron-size transverse spot of the initial electron bunch corresponds to the laser spot size, 

which  in  turn  may  lead  to  a  small  transverse  emittance.  At  present  the  emittance  requirements, 

including the asymmetry, are met with the use of expensive damping rings, which often yield long 

bunches  and  therefore  require  subsequent  bunch  compressions.  There  is  another  R&D  effort 

underway to produce asymmetric beams using RF guns [19]. 

As recognized in Ref. [16], the electron injection into the acceleration phase of a wakefield takes 

place due to nonlinear Langmuir wave wave-breaking. This breaking of the Langmuir wave, known 

since  J.  Dawson’s publication  in  Ref.  [20],  has  been  studied  theoretically  and  experimentally  (see 

Ref.  [2]  and  literature  therein).  It  is  important  to  notice  that  the  realization  of  resilience  against 

wave-breaking  in  the  relativistic  regime  in  the  longitudinal  direction  led  to  the  original  LWFA 

suggestion  [1].  In  the  non-one-dimensional  case  and  in  the  case  of  an  inhomogeneous  plasma 

density  the  wake  wave-breaking  acquires  features  that  allow  manipulation of  the  injected  electron 

bunch  parameters.  For  example,  properties  of  the  transverse  wake  wave-breaking  [21]  have  been 

used  in  Refs.  [4,15,22]  in  order  to  explain  nonlinear  wake  evolution  and  electron  acceleration  in 

 

4

homogeneous  and  inhomogeneous  plasmas.  In  addition,  longitudinal  breaking  was  invoked  to 

describe  electron  self-injection  in  homogeneous  plasmas  [23,24],  and  the  controllable  electron 

injection regimes in plasmas with a tailored density profile [25]. 

In  the  present  paper  we  shall  formulate  an  approach  for  producing  asymmetric  emittance 

electron  bunches  by  using  asymmetric  laser  pulse  focusing  for  the  laser  wakefield  acceleration, 

when the transverse wake breaking leads to the formation of an electron bunch elongated along the 

transverse direction.  

2. Laser Line Focus  

 

 

In  present  day  chirped  pulse  amplification  (CPA)  based  laser  systems,  laser  pulses  have  a 

Gaussian (TEM00)-like spatial profile. There are several schemes to achieve a line focus, which has 

an  asymmetric  transverse  spatial  profile.  One  is  using  astigmatism  on  the  sagittal  plane  of  a 

spherical  mirror.  This  technique  was  applied  to  produce  transient  X-ray  lasers.  This  scheme  can 

generate a large aspect ratio of 300:1; however, the focusing depth is limited and a time difference 

for  arriving  at  the  focus  arises  [26].  A  slightly  misaligned  off-axis  parabolic  mirror  generates 

astigmatism, resulting in an asymmetric focal spot. A toroidal mirror can be used. Here, we propose 

to  use  a  pair  of  reflective  cylindrical  mirrors.  Cylindrical  mirrors  are  easy  to  fabricate  and  cost-

saving. A large amount of astigmatism of cylindrical mirrors placed off-axis can be improved when 

the  incident  angle  is  chosen  properly.  Further  study  is  needed  to  examine  the  effect  of  effective 

pulse elongation in time using these line focus techniques in the generation of wakefields.  

3. Structure of Transverse Wake Wave Breaking 

Due to the nonlinear dependence of the Langmuir wave frequency on its amplitude, caused 

by the electron density redistribution along the laser pulse axis and by the relativistic dependence of 

the  Langmuir  frequency  on  the  kinetic  energy  of  the  electrons,  surfaces  of  constant  phase  in  the 

 

5

wake wave give rise to a paraboloidal form [27]. The curvature of constant phase surfaces increases 

with  the  distance  from  the  laser  pulse  until  the  curvature  radius  R  becomes  comparable  to  the 

electron displacementς in the wake, leading to electron trajectory self-intersection. This is the so-

called  regime  of  transverse  wake  breaking,  which  leads  to  electron  injection  into  the  acceleration 

phase [21]. Along the lines of Refs. [21, 28] we consider a wakefield plasma wave excited by a laser 

pulse  of  finite  width.  The  condition  of  the  wake  excitation  determines 

wω  and  wk  which  are  the 

wake  frequency  and  wavenumber,  respectively,  where 

ω =
w

k v
w g

,  and 

gv  is  the  group  velocity  of 

the  driver  laser  pulse.  The  wake  wave  frequency,  equal  to  the  local  value  of  the  Langmuir 

frequency, depends on the transverse coordinates, y and z. This dependence arises due to the plasma 

outward motion caused by the laser pulse ponderomotive pressure and by the relativistic dependence 

of  the  Langmuir  frequency  on  the  wave  amplitude.  The  dependence  on  the  wave  amplitude  is 

determined by the laser pulse transverse shape, which can be approximated in the vicinity of the axis

. With Eqs. (5)-(7) we obtain the constant phase surfaces for 

cases 

0ζ ≠  presented in Figs. 1 and 2.  

In both cases, in Figs. 1 and 2, the projections of the constant phase surface onto the 

,x y  plane have 

the form of a “swallow tail”. This corresponds to one of the forms of fundamental catastrophes (see. 

[29]).  

When the displacement value is in between the curvature radii, i.e. 

R

y

Rς< <
z

 as in the case 

shown in Fig. 1, the singularity in the  ( , )y z  plane is elongated along the z axis. On the other hand, 

if 

R

y

z

<

R ς

< , the singularity in the  ( , )y z  plane is elongated along the y axis, as shown in Fig. 2 c. 

These types of singularities are typical, or, in other words, are structurally stable. In the 3D 

configurations they correspond to the the transverse wave breaking with the injection into the 

acceleration phase of flat electron bunches.  

In the axially symmetric geometry when the curvature radii along the y and z directions equal 

to  each  other, 

R

y

R=
z

,  the  injected  electron  bunch  also  has  axial  symmetry.  However,  this 

configuration is not structurally stable and small perturbations of a general type transform it into a 

 

8

structurally stable configuration with non-axially-symmetric electron bunch. We point out that in the 

case of the gradual increase of the wake wave curvature the first breaking occurs under the condition 

when  the  electron  displacement  becomes  greater  than  the  minimal  curvature  radius,  e.g. 

when y
R

Rς< <
z

, and the injected electron bunch is elongated along the minimal curvature direction 

as in Fig. 1. 

After  the  electron  trajectory  self-intersection  has  occurred,  the  injected  electrons  are 

accelerated  and  they  perform  betatron  oscillations  in  the  transverse  direction.  This  stage  of  the 

electron bunch evolution is discussed below in Sections 4 and 5, where we present the results of the 

particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and the analytical theory of betatron oscillations when the effects 

of the space charge are taken into account.  

 

4. Results of Simulations of Transverse Wake Wave Breaking and Electron Bunch Injection 

The  paraboloidal  structures  of  the  wake  plasma  wave  have  been  seen  routinely  in  the  three 

dimensional  particle-in-cell  simulations  of  high  intensity  laser  pulse  propagation  in  underdense 

plasmas, e.  g. see Refs. [30, 31] where  the laser  pulse frequency upshifting has been discussed in 

counter-  and  co-propagating  two  pulse  interaction  configurations.  In  Refs.  [6,  31]  3D  PIC 

simulations distinctly show the “swallow tail” structure in the electron density distribution formed in 

the  nonlinear  wake  wave.  In  this  Section  we  present  3D  PIC  simulation  results  for  the  electron 

bunch  injection,  which  clearly  demonstrate  the  elongated  electron  bunch  generation  during  the 

transverse  wake  wave  breaking.  We  use  the  electromagnetic  relativistic  PIC  computer  code 

FPLaser3D  [24],  which  exploits  the  moving  window  technique  and  the  density  decomposition 

scheme  of  the  current  assignment  with  bell-shaped  quasiparticles  [32];  this  weighting  scheme 

reduces significantly unphysical numerical effects of the standard PIC method. 

 

9

The flat electron bunch injection is seen in Fig. 3, where the results of the simulations of the 

ultrashort  laser  pulse  interaction  with  an  underdense  plasma  target  are  shown.  Here  the  linearly 

polarized laser pulse with the electric field along the z direction and with wavelength λ=0.8 µm has 

its  intensity equal to I=1020  W/cm2.  The pulse duration  is 27  fs, and is focused  into  a  spot with  a 

diameter of 16 µm. The laser pulse propagates along the x direction from the right to left in a plasma 

with density  ne=1019 cm-3. The simulations were performed with the use of “the moving window” 

technique in a simulation box of size 80x56x56 λ3. The mesh sizes in the direction of the laser pulse 

propagation  and  in  the  transverse  direction  are  ∆x=  λ/20  and  ∆y=∆z=  λ/10,  respectively,  with  8 

particles (electrons and protons) per cell. In Fig. 3 where the electron density distribution in the z=0 

plane: a); in the y=0 plane: b); and in the 

x

+

ct

=

315

λ

 plane: c) are presented we distinctly see fast 

electron bunches injected into the second period of the wake wave. The electron bunch width in the 

z-direction  is  approximately  two  times  larger  than  in  the  y-direction.  The  flat  electron  bunch 

formation is also seen in Fig. 4, where the density distributions of fast electrons (with px>200 MeV) 

in the z=0 plane: a); and in the y=0 plane are presented. We note here that electron oscillations in the 

perpendicular  directions,  along  the  y  and  z  axes,  have  different  frequencies,  as  distinctly  seen  in 

In  the  case  under  consideration  the  transverse  asymmetry  of  the  wake  breaking  and  the 

electron bunch generation occurs in this case due to the effect of the linear polarization of the laser. 

As found in Ref. [33] the linearly polarized laser pulse generates axially asymmetric self-focusing 

channels  and  a  wake  with  different  amplitudes  in  the  directions  along  and  perpendicular  to  the 

polarization  direction.  We  note  that  the  wake  field  accelerated  electron  bunches  with  the  elliptic 

form in the transverse direction have been observed in the experiments presented in Ref. [34], where 

the transverse elongation has been attributed to the effects of linear polarization of the laser pulse-

5. Equilibrium and Betatron Oscillations of a Transversally Elongated Electron Bunch with 

Space Charge 

Here  we  consider  the  electron  bunch  equilibrium  configuration  inside  the  wake  when  its 

transverse size is substantially smaller than its length. Then we describe betratron oscillations of the 

bunch in the transverse direction. We assume that the longitudinal (along the x axis) scale length of 

the  fast  electron bunch  is  much greater than its scale  length  in  the  transverse  direction. Below we 

therefore assume that the wakefield and the electron bunch are homogeneous along the x axis. Such 

approximation  may  be  valid  in  the  near-axis  region  of  the  wake  when  the  injection  time  is  of  the 

order of the electron acceleration time.  

Betatron oscillations of electrons moving inside the wake wave occur due to the transverse 

component of the wake electric field vanishing along the axis and being linearly proportional to the 

transverse coordinates, y and z, in the vicinity of the axis:

⊥ =

E

e  with the components, Ey

and Ez, depending on the specific form of the wake field. The effects of the magnetic field, which is 

self-generated in the regular wake wave, are substantially weaker than the electric field effects, e. g. 

see Ref. [17], and we shall neglect them in our model for the sake of simplicity. On the other hand, 

the pinching by the magnetic field generated by the electric current carried by fast electrons partially 

compensates the repelling force due to the electron space charge and we incorporate its effects into 

our description.  

We assume that the transverse cross section of the wake wave has an elliptic form with the 

semi axes equal to RWA22 and RWA33 with RW being the transverse scale length. The positive electric 

charge density in the wake is en0. Using the Dirichlet formula for the electric field of a uniformly 

charged elliptic cylinder (see in Ref. [35] explanations of the Dirichlet formalism for the solution of 

 

11

the  Poisson  equation  in  the  confocal  ellipsoidal  coordinates),  we  write  for  the  transverse  electric 

field originating from the electric charge separation inside the wake:

Within the framework of the test particle approximation, when we can neglect the effects of 

the electric and magnetic field produced by the fast electron bunch, the relativistic electron motion 

in the electric field given by Eq. (9) corresponds to the betatron oscillations. It is easy to obtain that 

the oscillations are performed along the y and z axes with the frequencies

the betatron oscillations have been studied assuming axial symmetry of the wake and electron bunch.

corresponds to the situation when just one value among

that in the generic case the singularity develops as a surface. We note that such type of singularity

frame  b).    From  the  form  of  the  potential  function, 

( , )a bΠ

,  we  can  see  that  in  general  case  the 

frequencies  of  the  oscillations  along  the  y-  and  z-directions  are  different  and  depend  on  the 

oscillation  amplitudes.  If  the  emittances, 

2ε  and 

3ε ,  which  are  determined  by  the  injection 

mechanism,  vanish,  as  in  Fig.  5  b),  the  iso-contours  of  the  function 

( , )a bΠ

can  intersect  the  axis 

a=0 or b=0. This corresponds to the case when in nonlinear oscillations one semi-axis of the bunch 

becomes  equal  to  zero  and  formally  the  bunch  aspect  ratio  tends  to  infinity.  We  note  that  in  the 

axially symmetric configuration the space charge effect prevents the bunch radius from vanishing. 

For  a  flat  electron  beam  the  space  charge  effects  are  not  strong  enough  and  the  bunch 

demagnification in one of the directions becomes possible. 

The  transverse  equilibrium  of  the  electron  bunch  in  the  wake  corresponds  to  the  local 

minimum of the function 

( , )a bΠ

 given by Eq. (23). It is given by a static solution of Eqs. (20,21) 

for  which  the  terms  on  the  right  hand  sides  vanish.  We  consider  the  case  when  the  emittances 

vanish. Solving these algebraic equations assuming 

0ε =  and 

0ε = , we obtain for the equilibrium

6. Discussion and Conclusion  

In  conclusion,  a  method  is  suggested  for  electron  injection  via  the  transverse  wake  wave 

breaking, when the electron trajectory self-intersection leads to the formation of an electron bunch 

elongated in the transverse direction. In this scheme we take advantage of the laser pulse focussed 

into an elongated spot. In turn, this results in a wakefield generation that is localized in the axially 

non-symmetric region with the components of the transverse electric field not equal to each other. 

With  the  aid  of  catastrophe  theory  we  demonstrate  that  a  structurally  stable  regime  of  transverse 

wake  breaking  leads  to  the  transversally  elongated  electron  bunch  generation.  Three-dimensional 

particle-in-cell  simulations  of  the  laser  pulse  interaction  with  an  underdense  plasma  show  that 

electrons, injected via the transverse wake wave breaking, form a bunch with an aspect ratio larger 

than  unity.    Electrons  accelerated  by  the  wake  perform  betatron  oscillations  with  different 

amplitudes and frequencies along the two transverse coordinates. An exact analytical solution of the 

electron hydrodynamics equations demonstrates the space charge effects, which modify the electron 

bunch equilibrium and the frequencies and structure of the mode of  betatron oscillations.  

For  a  typical  total  number  of  electrons  in  the  bunch  accelerated  by  the  wake  equal  to 

totN =

1010

,  which  corresponds  to  the  charge  1.6  nC,  and  a  bunch  length  of 10 mµ ,  the  electron 

number  per  unit  length  is

One  of  the most  important  applications of  laser  produced  relativistic  electrons  is  to  generate 

positron  bunches  for  their  injection  into  conventional  accelerators.  To  obtain  polarized  positron 

beams  an  additional  circularly  polarized  laser  pulse  (counterpropagating  with  the  electron  bunch) 

may be used to generate longitudinally polarized gamma ray photons, which then collide with a thin 

film target [43].  

The emittance of laser accelerated ions can also be manipulated by changing the structure of 

either the target irradiated by the laser pulse or the form of the focusing system. In the first case we 

refer  to  the  double  layer  target  proposed  in  Ref.  [44]  in  order  to  produce  beams  with  controlled 

quality,  and  studied  in  detail  via  computer  simulations  [45]  and  experiments  [46].  Ref.  [44] 

proposed to use two-layer targets in which the first layer consists of heavy multicharged ions and the 

second layer (thin and narrow in the transverse direction) consists of light ions (e.g. protons). If the 

thin proton layer is elongated in one direction it will result in the generation of a flat proton beam. A 

more complex form of the proton layer may be used in order to provide a uniform irradiation of the 

target,  which  is  required  in  the  applications  of  the  laser  accelerated  ions  for  hadron  therapy.  The 

second  case  uses  an  ion  focusing  technique  corresponding  to  a  thin  hollow  cylindrical  shell 

irradiated  by  a  femtosecond  high-power  laser  pulse  when  the  ion  bunch  flies  through  it.  As 

demonstrated in the experiments presented in Ref. [47], this technique allows one to simultaneously 

focus  the  proton  beam  and  to  cut  it  onto  quasi-monoenergetic  beamlets.    The  use  of  an  elliptical 

cylinder shell provides a way for the transverse emittance manipulation. In addition, a phase rotator, 

which  also  produces  quasi-monoenergetic  ion  beamlets  [48],  when  its  transverse  electric  field  is 

made anisotropic, can produce flat ion beams.

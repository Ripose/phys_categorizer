Abstract

We  present  theory  for  coherent  effects  observed  in  crystal  collimation  experiments

that  is  in  good  quantitative  agreement  with  RHIC  and  Tevatron  data.  We  show  that

coherent scattering in a bent crystal strongly amplifies beam diffusion, with an effective

radiation  length  shortened  by  orders  of  magnitude  compared  to  amorphous  material.

This coherent scattering could replace the traditional amorphous scattering in accelerator

collimation systems. We predict that crystal collimation for negative particles can be as

strong  as  for  positives,  unlike  with  channeling  effect.  This  opens  a  principle  way  for

efficient crystal steering of negative particles at accelerators. It can be demonstrated with

antiproton  crystal  collimation  at  the  Tevatron.  We  predict  strong  effects  for  the

upcoming Tevatron experiment, for protons and antiprotons.

1.  Introduction

Bent crystal technique is well established for channeling high-energy beams, in particular for

beam  extraction  from  accelerators  [1].  It  was  successfully  applied  from  3  MeV  [2]  to  world

highest energy [3], is well understood theoretically [4] and considered as possible instrument for

the 7 TeV LHC [5-7]. IHEP Protvino experiments have demonstrated that this technique can be
quite  efficient  [8]:  85%  of  70  GeV  proton  beam  is  extracted  at  beam  intensity  up  to  4×1012.

Much of the IHEP physics program relies on crystal channeled beams used regularly since 1989.

The  theory  of  crystal  extraction  is  based  on  simulations  tracking  the  particles  through  a

curved  crystal  lattice  and  accelerator  environment  [9,10].  Simulation  code  CATCH  [11]  was

successfully tested in channeling experiments at CERN SPS [12], Tevatron [13], RHIC [14-16],

and  IHEP  U-70  [4].  Monte  Carlo  predictions,  suggesting  a  "multipass"  mode  of  crystal

extraction where efficiency is dominated by the multiplicity of particle encounters with a short

crystal in a ring, lead to the record high efficiency demonstrated at IHEP [8].

It  would  be  promising  to  apply  the  bent-crystal  technique  for  a  beam  halo  scraping  in  the

Tevatron [17] and LHC [7] where an order of magnitude reduction is expected in the accelerator-

related backgrounds. A bent crystal, serving as a primary element, should coherently bend halo

particles onto a secondary collimator. Crystal collimation was first proposed and studied in 1989

at  IHEP  for  a  3  TeV  UNK  [18,19]  collider.  In  1991  it  was  studied  for  20  TeV  SSC  [20].  A

demonstration experiment on crystal collimation was performed in 1998 at IHEP where a factor-

of-2 reduction in the accelerator background was obtained with a bent crystal incorporated into

beam cleaning system [21].

2. RHIC and Tevatron experiments

Another  experiment  on  crystal  collimation  was  done  at  the  Relativistic  Heavy  Ion  Collider

[14-16]. The Yellow ring of the RHIC had a bent Si crystal collimator, 5 mm along the beam. By

properly aligning the crystal to the beam halo, particles entering the crystal were deflected away

from  the  beam  and  intercepted  downstream  in  a  copper  scraper.  RHIC  crystal  collimator

efficiency measured for gold ions as a function of the crystal angle was found in good agreement

with simulations with the measured machine optics, as seen in Fig. 1. For the 2003 RHIC run,

the  theory  predicted  the  efficiency  of  32%,  and  averaging  over  the  data  for  this  run  gave  the

measured  efficiency  of  26%.  The  modest  figure  of  efficiency  ≈30%,  both  in  theory  and

experiment, is attributed to the high angular spread of the beam that hits the crystal face as set by

machine optics. It is worth to compare this figure of efficiency for gold ions at RHIC to the 40%

efficiency achieved with the same (5 mm O-shaped Si) crystal for protons at IHEP in 1998 [22].

Crystal extraction of Pb ions was earlier demonstrated at CERN SPS with efficiency of 4-11%

for a long (40 mm) Si crystal [23].

the crystal  orientation  at  RHIC.  Two  sets  of  CATCH  simulation  shown:  with  preliminary  optics  (dash)

and with measured optics (solid).

In the analysis of crystal collimation, major attention was paid so far to the peak efficiency of

channeling that makes applications so attractive. However, apart from a strong channeling peak,

the  RHIC  collimation  experiment  has  shown  another  interesting  feature.  Fig.  1  shows  a

substantial  reduction  in  the  rate  of  nuclear  interactions  in  the  crystal  observed  over  a  broad

angular range, -2000 to -1500 µrad, corresponding to the crystal bending angle (0.44 mrad). This

plateau  in  the  RHIC  collimation  plots  was  observed  also  in  simulations  [14-16].  While  the

quantitative agreement was good, the interpretation of the results remained an important issue.

 Following  the  RHIC  experiment,  a  crystal  collimator  has  been  installed  into  the  Tevatron,

using the same “O-shaped” Si crystal from the RHIC collimation set-up. Remarkably, the data

coming from the Tevatron experiment show the effects very similar to RHIC observations, Fig. 2

[24].  The  dramatic  dip  in  the  local  background  rate  with  aligned  crystal  indicates  a  very  high

channeling  efficiency,  confirming  the  high  expectations  for  crystal  collimation  at  high  energy

colliders [7,17]. Moreover, the plateau effect is confirmed and becomes stronger, again in very

good quantitative agreement [24] with simulation [25].

3. Simulations and interpretation

Ref.  [25]  gave  explanation  of  the  plateau  effect  in  crystal  collimation  relating  it  to  the

coherent  scattering  (“reflection”)  of  particles  on  the  field  of  bent  crystal  atomic  planes.  This

coherent  scattering  makes  the  beam  diffusion  in  accelerator  much  stronger  compared  to

scattering in amorphous material and affects the particle loss pattern in the accelerator ring.

For the plateau range, every particle becomes tangential to atomic planes somewhere in a bent

crystal  depth.  Two  effects  in  these  conditions  are  known  from  the  physics  of  channeling  and

quasi-channeling:  “volume  capture”  (scattering-induced  transfers  of  random  particles  to

channeled states) [26] and “volume reflection” (scattering of random particles off the potential of

bent atomic planes) [27].

In order to understand fully the origin of the plateau effect, we simulated RHIC and Tevatron

experiments studying the particle dynamics in single and multiple interactions with a bent crystal

in  different  angular  ranges  in  the  environment  of  collimation  experiment.  At  a  random  crystal

orientation, these interactions are similar to those in amorphous media.

angular distributions. Zero angle corresponds to the direction of an incident particle.

Fig. 3(a) shows schematically the case of a particle becoming tangential to atomic planes in a

crystal  depth  [27].  With  some  probability,  such  a  particle  is  trapped  into  channeled  state  1;

otherwise,  it  is  scattered  (“reflected”)  in  the  coherent  potential  of  bent  atomic  planes.  The

simulated  exit  angular  distributions  of  a  particle  (100  GeV/u  gold  ion  for  RHIC  and  980  GeV

proton for the Tevatron) interacting with the crystal used in the experiments are shown in Fig.

3(b). The distributions show a clear shift in the average exit angle to the side opposite to a crystal

bending - this effect is known as volume reflection [27]. The most probable exit angle is about –

17 µrad for RHIC and –5.3 µrad for the Tevatron, i.e., 1-2 critical channeling angle (10 µrad for

RHIC  and  5  µrad  for  Tevatron).  This  shift  is  independent  of  the  incidence  angle  within  the

plateau  range  in  Figs.  1-2.  Apart  from  a  spectacular  shift,  the  distributions  show  a  substantial

broadening.  The  r.m.s.  exit  angle  of  the  reflected  beam  in  Fig.3(b)  is  22  (RHIC)  and  7.2

(Tevatron) µrad, which is much broader than the r.m.s. scattering angle at a random incidence,

i.e., 13 µrad for RHIC and 3.3 µrad for the Tevatron. So, a coherent scattering on the potential of

bent atomic planes appears a very significant factor for particle dynamics in accelerator.

A small number of particles is volume-captured and channeled over some crystal length, and

thus obtains a substantial bending angle. The probability of volume capture into stable channeled
states reduces with energy E as E-3/2 [28], and is often neglected. However, it can be much higher

for unstable states [29] which may cause particle bending of some tens µrad, a very significant

value for particle dynamics in accelerator. Typically, in the collimation setups of the considered

experiments,  a  particle  deflection  of  >20-30  µrad  at  a  crystal  leads  to  its  immediate  loss  at  a

secondary collimator.

For  RHIC  collimation  setup,  with  the  O-shaped  crystal  at  6σ,  the  computed  probability  of

particle  deflection  beyond  a  7σ  secondary  aperture  because  of  a  volume  capture  is  2%  per  a

single  encounter  with  the  crystal.  For  the  Tevatron,  with  crystal  at  5σ,  the  probability  of

deflection  beyond  a  5.5σ  aperture  is  0.5%  per  every  encounter  with  a  crystal.  As  a  5  mm  Si

crystal  is  just  ~1%  of  a  proton  nuclear  interaction  length,  the  number  of  encounters  in  the

accelerator ring can potentially be very high, and the accumulated probability of volume capture

quite significant.

In  a  circular  accelerator,  the  scattered  particles  continue  the  circulation  in  the  ring  and

encounter  the  crystal  again  and  again  on  later  turns.  The  particle  distribution  modifies  due  to

betatron  oscillations  in  the  ring  and  due  to  scattering  on  every  encounter  with  the  crystal.  For

crystal  orientation  within  the  plateau  in  Figs.  1-2,  the  conditions  for  coherent  scattering  and

volume  capture  take  place  on  every  encounter  with  the  crystal.  For  random  orientation,  this

never  happens.  Respectively,  the  particle  amplitude  in  accelerator  grows  faster  if  coherent

processes contribute strongly to the overall scattering. By every encounter with a crystal, beam
emittance grows by about β(∆θ)2, where β is accelerator beta function and ∆θ is the scattering

angle in crystal. With the O-shaped crystal used in the experiments and simulations, we find that

beam emittance grows faster by a factor of 3 in RHIC case, and factor of 5 in the Tevatron case,

in the plateau region compared to random alignment. This difference in beam dynamics on the

phase space with a crystal under conditions of coherent scattering leads to a faster particle loss

on the secondary elements of accelerator. As a result, the particle loss (nuclear interactions) in

crystal is reduced, as part of the loss now goes to different elements in the ring.

4. Predictions for the Tevatron

In order to check our understanding and make further predictions, we simulated the ongoing

Tevatron collimation experiment. More details of the used settings are in ref. [17,30]. We used

the  recent  edition  of  Tevatron  accelerator  lattice  [31].  In  the  bending  plane,  the  accelerator

functions  were  β=60.205  m  and  α=-0.216  at  the  crystal  location.  The  O-shaped  crystal  was

placed at 5σ and served as a primary element in collimation scheme. The secondary collimator

was  placed  31.5  m  downstream,  at  5.5σ.  Particle  tracking  in  the  Tevatron  lattice  is  done  with

linear transfer matrices. Each particle was allowed to make an unlimited number of turns in the

ring and of encounters with the crystal until a particle either undergoes a nuclear interaction in

the crystal or hits the secondary collimator (either because of a bending effect in the channeling

crystal or because of the scattering events). A non-channeling amorphous  layer 2 micron thick

was assumed on the crystal surface due to its irregularity at a micron level.

The simulated nuclear interaction rate in the O-shaped crystal is shown in Fig. 2 [24] together

with  the  experimental  data.  The  remarkable  dip  on  the  plot,  nearly  95%  down  from  the  rate

observed at random orientation, is due to channeling with a high efficiency in the environment of

the Tevatron collimation experiment. One can expect about an order of magnitude reduction of

machine-related  backgrounds  in  the  collider  detector  if  crystal  components  are  installed  in  the

collimation systems of collider. The dip is ~30 µrad wide, which is greater than 2 critical angles

because  here  channeling  is  essentially  multipass,  multiturn  effect.  Protons  encounter  crystal

several  times,  scatter,  go  on  circulating  in  the  ring,  and  then  get  channeled  on  some  later

encounter. This scattering contributes sizably to the width of the peak. A distinct feature in Fig. 2

is the plateau on the plot, with a 50% reduction in the rate that is in good quantitative agreement

with the experiment.

It is interesting to compare the relative contributions of volume capture and volume reflection

to  the  plateau  effect.  From  all  the  protons  intercepted  by  the  secondary  collimator  in  the

Tevatron, roughly 80% are peaked at the edge while ~20% have a long flat distribution with big

impact parameters. These 20% of the aperture loss are “volume-captured” protons while the 80%

can be called  “volume-reflected” particles. Their origin can be roughly understood also in the

following way. A typical number of proton encounters with the crystal before a proton loss was

~20. With the ~0.5% probability (per encounter) of channeling a proton to the 5.5σ aperture, the

overall  probability  of  volume-capture  channeling is  ~10%,  thus  producing  this  long  flat  tail  of

big impact parameters. Volume-reflected protons diffuse to the aperture. Some of them are lost

at its edge while others die in crystal.

So, basic explanation to the plateau effect in collimation is a strong coherent contribution to

the overall scattering, affecting the particle loss pattern along the accelerator. The increase in the

crystal  scattering  angle  from  coherent  effects  makes  a  beam  diffusion  to  increase  several-fold.

This diffusion and the presence of the secondary aperture make the effect of plateau. However,

the  volume-capture  contribution  (a  non-diffusion  term)  is  not  negligible,  making  the  overall

kinetic picture more complicated.

New  experimental  tests  would  be  decisive  for  the  theory.  A  new  bent  crystal  (strip-type

deflector produced in IHEP) is now replacing the O-shaped crystal in the Tevatron [24]. The new

crystal is Si (110), 3 mm along the beam, 0.15 mrad bent. Before the measurements started with

it, we present our predictions in Fig. 4. The rate suppression of 65% at plateau, 0.15 mrad wide,

is expected with the new crystal in the same setup. The channeling dip at a crystal best alignment

is expected somewhat deeper than with the old crystal, about 96%. The most probable reflection

angle for 980 GeV proton in this crystal is –8.5 µrad, which is 1.7 times the critical angle.

with the “strip” crystal.

Figure 5 The predicted crystal nuclear interaction rate for protons in the Tevatron with collimator set

at 5.5 and 7 sigma.

In order to study the behavior of the plateau effect in different collimation geometry, we show

another prediction in Fig. 5. Here the secondary collimator is placed at 7σ while the crystal is

kept at 5σ. Thus, the horizontal offset is increased from 0.5 to 2σ. In this setup, the predicted rate

suppression is 50% at plateau, and the channeling dip at crystal best alignment is 97%.

5. Negative particles

A very interesting question is how this effect applies to particles of negative charge. Volume

reflection is  known  also for negative particles, although  its  expected  magnitude  is  much  lower

than for positive ones [27]. At the Tevatron, it is possible to study crystal physics in the same

setup also with particles of negative charge, antiprotons. For channeling phenomenon, the sign of

particle  charge  plays  a  critical  role.  For  instance,  dechanneling  is  very  strong  for  negative

particles;  therefore  bent  crystal  channeling  made  only  negligible  bending  effect  for  negatives

[32].  However,  our  theory  predicts  that  a  crystal  collimation  effect  for  antiprotons  is  about  as

strong  as  one  for  protons,  Fig.  4.  We  suggest  to  check  this  prediction  in  the  Tevatron  with

antiprotons,  as  this  appears  critical  for  understanding  of  crystal  collimation  mechanism  and,

crucially, it also opens a principle way to efficient crystal steering of negatively charged particles

at accelerators. In a single encounter, Fig. 6, the mean exit angle for antiprotons is just -1.6 µrad

while  for  protons  it  is  -7.5  µrad  (and  most  probable  exit  angle  is  respectively  -4  and  -9  µrad).

However, in our theory the effect is run by the mean square exit angle, and we find the r.m.s.

angle about the same for protons and antiprotons, ~12 µrad. At plateau, the rate is suppressed by

~70% for antiprotons.

Figure 6 Exit angular distributions for 980 GeV proton and antiproton in the “strip” crystal.

Usually,  plain  channeling  is  not  useful  for  bending  of  negative  particles  because  of  very

strong dechanneling [32]. However, it was already noticed in 1998 [33] that at TeV energies in

case  of  collimation  (because  of small  bending  angles  involved)  the  negative  particles  could  be

efficiently  channeled,  e.g.  for  collimation  of  2-TeV  negative  muons  [33].  In  the  Tevatron  case

we find a significant channeling effect  for 1 TeV antiprotons because  here  a  bending  effect  of

merely ~25 µrad is significant. At the dip in Fig. 5, the rate suppression for antiprotons is 87%.

We  say  again  that  the  mean  angular  kick  for  antiprotons  is  factor  of  5  smaller  than  for

protons,  but  the  collimation  effect  at  the  plateau  for  antiprotons  is  at  least  as  strong  as  for

protons. This clearly contradicts the intuitive view that the mean exit angle different from zero

(i.e. literally reflection) is responsible for the plateau effect in crystal collimation. The Tevatron

experiment could answer whether our theory is true.

6. Crystal model test in CERN SPS H8 experiment

The effect of volume reflection is observed in crystal collimation indirectly, through increased

beam  diffusion.  An  experiment  on  a  direct  measurement  of  volume  reflection  angle  and

reflection efficiency has been in progress at CERN SPS [34] making use of H8 external 400 GeV

proton micro-beam line with unique possibilities for crystal tests. This experiment allows another

check of the theory. Our model has predicted [35] for the SPS experiment a reflection with most

probable angle of 13 µrad and efficiency of 96%; see more details in ref. [36].

7. Bent crystal as a smart material

Strong  scattering  over  a  short  length  means  that  the  effective  scattering  length  is  strongly

reduced  compared  to  a  radiation  length  LR  of  an  amorphous  material.  Some  of  the  Si  crystals

produced  at  PNPI  [37]  and  tested  at  IHEP  were  just  0.3  mm  along  the  beam,  with  bending  of

some hundred µrad. In such a short crystal with bending of 20 µrad, a 7 TeV proton obtains ~2.2

µrad  r.m.s.  angle  of  coherent  scattering,  according  to  simulation.  This  is  equivalent  to  a

“radiation  length”  of  just  0.25  mm,  a  factor  of  400  shorter  than  LR  in  amorphous  Silicon.

According to simulation, the effective “radiation length” in a bent W(110) crystal can be just ~10

µm. At the same time, the length of inelastic nuclear interaction LN reduces insignificantly. As a

result, the LN /LR ratio can reach ~10000 in this “smart material” while in amorphous materials it

is just ~5 to 30. In accelerator ring, such a smart target would be an extremely efficient scatterer.

8. Summary

Crystal  collimation  studies,  besides  promising  a  very  high  efficiency  of  the  technique  in

colliders,  reveal  a  new  interesting  physics  of  beam  scattering  off  the  coherent  field  of  bent

crystal atomic planes. This coherent scattering causes a perturbation (diffusion) of beam in the

conditions of crystal collimation experiments at RHIC and Tevatron and is observed as a strong

factor  affecting  particle  loss  in  the  accelerator  ring.  This  physics  is  essential  for  crystal

applications  in  colliders.  However,  it  exists  also  at  MeV  energies  as  shown  in  another  recent

study [38]. Possible applications of volume reflection at IHEP are considered in ref. [39].

Our  computer  model  is  in  good  quantitative  agreement  with  RHIC  and  Tevatron  data.  The

theory predicts that the factor behind the new coherent effects in crystal collimation is a strong

increase in the mean square angle of a particle scattered off the coherent field of a bent crystal.

We show that this opens way for efficient bent crystal steering of negative particles, which may

help, e.g., with collimation of antiprotons and muons.

Currently, accelerator physicists use a choice of amorphous scattering materials from low-Z

like  carbon  to  high-Z  like  tungsten.  Crystals  can  be  realized  also  as  smart  materials  with

effective scattering length three orders of magnitude shorter than a radiation length of amorphous

material. Nanotechnology offers more opportunity to construct smart materials for beam steering

[40]. Crystal technique could improve the efficiency of scattering and collimation by orders of

magnitude.

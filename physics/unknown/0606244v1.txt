Although  Gigahertz-scale 

free-carrier  modulators  have  been  previously 

demonstrated  in  silicon,  intensity  modulators  operating  at  Terahertz  speeds  have 

not been reported because of silicon’s weak ultrafast optical nonlinearity. We have 

demonstrated  intensity  modulation  of  light  with  light  in  a  silicon-polymer 

integrated  waveguide  device,  based  on  the  all-optical  Kerr  effect  —  the  same 

ultrafast  effect  used  in  four-wave  mixing.    Direct  measurements  of  time-domain 

intensity  modulation  are  made  at  speeds  of  10  GHz.  We  showed  experimentally 

that the ultrafast mechanism of this modulation functions at the optical frequency 

through  spectral  measurements,  and  that  intensity  modulation  at  frequencies  in 

excess  of  1  THz  can  be  obtained  in  this  device.    By  integrating  optical  polymers 

through  evanescent  coupling  to  high-mode-confinement  silicon  waveguides,  we 

greatly  increase  the  effective  nonlinearity  of  the  waveguide  for  cross-phase 

modulation.      The  combination  of  high  mode  confinement,  multiple  integrated

optical  components,  and  high  nonlinearities  produces  all-optical  ultrafast  devices 

operating  at  continuous-wave  power  levels  compatible  with  telecommunication 

systems.    Although  far  from  commercial  radio  frequency  optical  modulator 

standards  in  terms  of  extinction,  these  devices  are  a  first  step  in  development  of 

large-scale  integrated  ultrafast  optical  logic  in  silicon,  and  are  two  orders  of 

magnitude faster than previously reported silicon devices.  

If we are to build all-optical computers, as well as practical high-bandwidth all-optical 

wavelength converters and modulators, we must have the ability to modulate light with 

light  in  a  chip-scale,  highly  integrated  platform1,2,3,4.    The  ability  to  pattern  nanoscale 

structures  at  wafer  scales,  the  existence  of  commercial  electronic  chip  fabrication 

processes,  and  the  low  optical  loss  and  high  mode  confinement  available  in  silicon 

waveguides  all  combine  to  make  silicon-on-insulator  an  attractive  material  system  for 

very  large-scale  integrated  photonics5,6,7.      Recently,  compact  electrooptic  modulators 

based  on  free-carrier  effects  operating  at  speeds  up  to  10  GHz,8,9,10,11,12  electrooptic 

polymer-based  switches  and  optical  rectification-based  detectors,13,    lasers14,15,16,  and 

stimulated-Raman-scattering–based modulators17 have all been demonstrated in silicon.   

However,  integrated,  low-power,  ultrafast  devices  operating  with  speeds  in  the 

Terahertz have not previously been realized.   

Here we report experimental demonstration of intensity modulation of light with light in 

a  planar,  hybrid  silicon-on-insulator–polymer,  all-optical  modulator.    This  device  is 

based  on  the  optical  Kerr  effect,  which  underlies  effects  such  as  ultrafast  four-wave 

mixing.  We show that similar devices could operate at speeds up to 1 Terahertz.  The 

optical nonlinearity is substantially enhanced by a cladding of engineered χ3 nonlinear 

 

3 

optical polymer.18,19 The modulator is operated by off-the-shelf continuous-wave lasers 

and  erbium-doped  fiber  amplifiers,  with  intensity  levels  of  100  mW  per  laser  at  the 

entrance  to  the  gate  (but  after  the  fiber-to-chip  coupler)  and  of  around  30  mW  at  the 

source 

input  port. 

  Such  power 

levels  are  common 

in 

today’s  optical 

telecommunications systems.20 Our device is based on a Mach–Zehnder geometry, as is 

shown in figure 1. The source waveguide is split into two arms; in one of the arms, a 

gate signal is introduced via a 3dB coupler. The nonlinear Kerr effect enables the gate 

signal  to  induce  a  phase  shift  in  the  source  signal,  which  in  turn  allows  the  shifted 

source signal to interfere with the optical signal that has travelled down a reference arm 

at the end of the Mach–Zehnder interferometer, causing an intensity modulation of the 

source  signal.  The  Mach–Zehnder  interferometer  is  unbalanced,  which  allows  us  to 

control the intrinsic phase shift between the arms by tuning the source wavelength. 

The  precise  behaviour  of  the  entire  nonlinear  system  is  complex:  Not  only  is  there  a 

phase  shift  in  the  source  signal,  but  also  the  four-wave  mixing  process  produces 

sidebands  from  both  the  source  and  the  gate  laser,  which  must  be  considered  in 

analyzing  the  behaviour  of  the  device.  In  the  low-conversion  regime,  only  a  small 

fraction  of  the  source  wavelength  is  converted  into  other  wavelengths  via  four-wave 

mixing,  and  the  primary  effect  of  the  four-wave  mixing  process  is  to  phase  shift  the 

signal wave by a small amount. It is straightforward to show the effect of the gate signal 

on  the  source  signal  in  this  regime.  Let  ws,  wg  and  as,  ag  be  the  frequencies  and 

amplitudes of the source and gate lasers, respectively, and the sideband wa = ws + (ws-

Here, we have assumed that we can neglect second- and higher-order derivatives of the 

waveguide  effective  index,  which  is  reasonable  for  our  waveguide  geometry.  Similar 

expressions  exist  for  the  other  sideband  at  wg+(wg-ws),  and  for  the  effect  on  ag.  The 

crucial  point  is  that,  in  the  low-conversion  regime,  the  effect  of  the  gate  signal  is  to 

phase shift the source signal. The power level of the source signal is unchanged. Note 

also  that  the  dispersion  of  the  waveguide  does  not  affect  this  phase  shift.  Thus,  the 

bandwidth  of  the  device  is  limited  solely  by  the  effect  of  dispersion  on  the  intensity-

modulation envelope of the gate signal as the latter travels through the waveguide. The 

dispersive  properties  of  the waveguide used for this device are well known from both 

theory  and  experiment,  and  it  is  straightforward  to  show  that,  for  a  device  of  1-cm 

length,  minimal pulse distortion in the gate will occur up to intensity modulations of 1 

THz (see Supporting Online Materials,).    

The  most  straightforward  method  of  observing  the  intensity  modulation  is  simply  to 

send  in  a  modulated  gate  laser  and  an  unmodulated  source  laser,  and  to  observe  the 

intensity modulation on the source wavelength. We initially exercised each device with 

a  swept-wavelength  laser  and  diode  detector,  to  determine  the  optical  loss  and 

wavelength response between the gate and drop port, and between the source and drop 

ports. The devices were then connected to an Agilent 8703B, which is a radio-frequency 

vector-network  analyzer  operating  both  in  the  electrical  and  in  the  optical  domain.    A 

single laser, modulated with a sine wave at frequencies between 50 MHz and 10 GHz, 

was  run  through  an  EDFA  and  a  polarization  controller,  and  used  as  the  gate.    The 

 

5 

source was provided by a diode laser, which was amplified by a separate polarization-

maintaining EDFA.  At the input to the phase modulation arm, the power in the source 

frequency was 10 dBm; that in the gate was 17 dBm.  The output of the modulator was 

either  coupled  into  an  optical  spectrum  analyzer  (Figs.  2C  and  2D)  or  was  filtered  to 

suppress  the  gate  wavelength,  and  then  fed  into  the  input  port  of  the  vector  network 

analyzer (Fig. 2B).    The optical input port of the vector-network analyzer is a 20 GHz 

bandwidth  photodiode.  The  Agilent  8703B  is  designed  to  measure  the  transfer  of  an 

intensity modulation from one electrical- or laser-signal port to another such port. Such 

a system is typically used to measure the performance of modulators and detectors as a 

function  of  frequency.  It  reports  the  results  of  the  measurement  as  an  optical  S 

parameter, which is defined as follows. Let I(t) be time domain intensity measured by 

the photodiode. Then, the optical S parameter S is defined in dBo as

Here, T is an integration period for the measurement, and f is the frequency at which the 

optical S-parameter is being measured. N is a normalization offset selected such that, if 

the  gate  laser  was  simply  directed  into  the  photodetector  directly  (a  “through” 

measurement), the optical S parameter would be 0 dB. As shown in Figure 2, the optical 

S  parameter  for  our  nonlinear  device  was  about  5  dB  above  the  noise  floor, 

asymptotically approaching –37 dB. This non-zero S-parameter indicates that there is a 

significant  amount  of  intensity  transfer  from  the  gate  beam  to  the  signal  beam;  as  we 

can see from Equation 3, a mere phase modulation of the signal would not be detected. 

In  taking these measurements,  we noted that  the strength of the optical S-parameter 

depended  strongly  on  the  precise  wavelength  of  the  signal.  This  relation  provides  an 

 

6 

indication  that  the  intensity  transfer  is  caused  by  the  Mach–Zehnder  geometry,  as  the 

sensitivity  of  an  output  of  a  Mach–Zehnder  modulator  to  a  phase  shift  in  one  arm  is 

highly dependant on the relative phase shift between the two arms.   

Three  control  experiments    helped  us  to  establish  that  these  measurements  reflect  the 

phenomenon  described. First, measurements were performed with  the gate signal and 

pump signal turned off individually, and then with both turned off concurrently; in all 

three cases, no intensity coupling was observed, as detailed in Figure 2. Second, we ran 

experiments    on  devices  that  were  clad  with  optically  linear  polymers,  and  on  unclad 

devices, and observed no intensity modulation transfer in either case. Third, we built a 

device with just a single phase-modulation arm, and no Mach–Zehnder geometry. We 

saw  no  intensity  modulation    in  this  device  either,  although  four-wave  mixing  peaks 

were  observed,  indicating  phase  modulation  was  occurring  and  that  the  third-order 

nonlinearity  in  these  waveguides  was  comparable  with  that  observed  in  the  measured 

Mach–Zehnder  devices.  This  experiment  performed  with  the  linear  optical  polymer 

shows  that  thermal  and  free-carrier  mechanisms  cannot  be  the  source  of  the  intensity 

modulation  transfer.  That  the  optical  S  parameter  is  stronger  at  lower  frequencies    is 

probably due to the nonlinear polymer having a higher χ3 moment for lower frequencies. 

The most direct method to demonstrate that the intensity modulator shown here could in 

fact function in the terahertz regime would be, of course, simply to increase the rate of 

the  intensity  modulation  and  the  photodetector  bandwidth,  in  which  case,  we  believe,   

the  optical  S  parameter  would  continue  roughly  at  the  asymptote  that  it  appears  to 

approach in figure 2.  Equipment to generate intensity modulations at this frequency is 

not readily available, however, and there is no simple photodetector that is capable of 

 

7 

performing with the fantastically short integration times needed to observe such a result 

directly. 

Accordingly, we measured the terahertz performance of the device indirectly, by means 

of  spectral  data.  To  show  that  the  modulators’  intensity-modulation  mechanism 

functions  in  the  terahertz  regime,  we  need  only  to  show  that  the  four-wave  mixing 

process occurs with the expected amplitudes in our device. Then, Equation 1 gives the 

exact  amount  of  phase  shift  that  occurs.  Figure  3  shows  a  block  diagram  of  the 

experiment,  as  well  as  several  spectral  measurements.  As  might  be  expected  from  an 

ultrafast  nonlinearity,  the  usual  set  of  four-wave  mixing  peaks  are  observed.  The 

magnitude  of  the  sidebands  shows  that  the  nonlinear  effect  is  not  attenuated,  even  at 

these extremely high frequencies; other modulation mechanisms that are limited to the 

10’s of gigahertz, such as free-carrier modulation, would not show such spectra. 

We  used  three,  rather  than  two,  lasers  in  this  experiment,  to  provide  a  comprehensive 

demonstration of the operation of the device.  In addition to demonstrating the ultrafast 

nonlinear optical effect, this experiment helped us to show a crucial point, which was 

the  privileged  nature  of  the  signal  wavelength:    Figure  3  shows  that,  when  the  signal 

wavelength  is  tuned,  the  phase  modulation  from  the  unbalanced  Mach–Zehnder 

modulator  can  be  seen  to  produce  an  intensity  modulation  on  the  source  wavelength, 

while the relevant sidebands are not altered in height. The results in Figure 3 show that 

we are observing terahertz-scale nonlinear effects, as well as Mach–Zehnder modulator 

behaviour, in the same measurement. 

By far the most important datum that can be extracted from the spectral measurements 

is the strength of the χ3. Given this value and Equation 1, we can deduce the phase shift 

 

8 

on the source signal based on a given intensity of the gate signal, from which  we can 

derive  the  optical  S  parameter.  As  shown  in  the  supporting  materials,  the  most 

straightforward  method  of  deriving  this  S  parameter    is  to  relate  the  phase  shift  in 

radians to the relative extinction of the four-wave mixing peaks: 

f4=Δφ

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

For  the  modulator  shown  in  Figure  3,  typical  values  of  f  were  –40  dB,  indicating  an 

approximate  phase  shift  of  0.04  radians  with  14  dBm  of  gate  power,  implying  a 

relatively  small  extinction  of  around  0.3  dB  for  this  modulator  device  in  this 

circumstance.  By  trading  increased  insertion  loss  for  increased  modulation  ratio  (by 

changing  the  point  of  operation  of  the  unbalanced  Mach–Zehnder  interferometer),  we 

could  achieve  an  extinction  of  3  dB  with    –24  dB  of  intrinsic  insertion  loss  in  our 

device.  However, because of the signal-to-noise limitations of our test setup, we were  

able  to  operate  in  only  the  low-loss/low-extinction  regime.  An  effective  nonlinear  χ3 

coefficient  can  be  estimated  as  1x10-20  (m/V)2,  and  the  nonlinear  coefficient  of  the 

polymer  is  approximately  three  times  that  value.    Typical  results  for  Δφ  ranged  from 

0.02 to 0.04 radians during testing for this gate power level. As can be seen in Figure 2, 

the implied optical S parameter from these observations is in close agreement with the 

directly measured S-parameter value at 10 GHz. 

Since the spectral measurements predict the observed modulation due to a χ3 moment, 

and  the  various  control  experiments  have  eliminated  mechanisms  such  as  free-carrier 

nonlinearities, we believe that we have demonstrated that the modulation mechanism is 

an  ultrafast  optical  nonlinearity.  From  equation  1,  it  is  clear  that  the  relative  phases 

 

9 

between the source and gate beam do not matter; it is only the overlap of the intensity of 

the gate beam that alters the phase of the source beam. Therefore, the bandwidth limit of 

our device will depend on the dispersion of the Silicon waveguides. Through the use of 

an  eigenvalue  solver,  and  confirmed  via  FDTD  and  experiment,  we  predict  our 

waveguides to have a group velocity dispersion of approximately –2000 ps nm-1 km-1. 

This value is   typical   for comparable waveguides21. It is a large value when compared 

to  the  group  velocity  dispersion  of  large  fiber-optical  modes;  however,  its  extremely 

small size makes our device  less sensitive to the effects of dispersion than are fibers, 

which  are  often  kilometres  in  length.    In  the  supporting  online  materials,  we  show 

simulations  in  the  time  domain  indicating  that  such  dispersion  is  unlikely  to  be  a 

limiting factor for devices such as the ones shown, up to speeds of at least 1 THz. 

Our  thoughts  about  the  practical  application  of  the  results  are  based  on  several 

considerations.  The  observed  phase  shift  is  fairly  low,  whereas  it  is  desirable  in  most 

Mach–Zehnder modulators to have at least π radians of phase shift. However, polymer 

strengths  have  been  consistently  improving  over  the  past  several  years,  and  we  can 

reasonably expect this trend to continue. Also, it is very likely that we will be able to 

decrease the waveguide loss from the approximately 7 dB/cm of loss achieved in these 

devices  to  less  than  1  dB/cm  of  loss22.  In  that  case,  we  can  increase  the  length  of  the 

device    dramatically,  although  that  change  will  in  turn  increase  the  limitations  on 

bandwidth  due  to  waveguide  dispersion.  If  the  nonlinear  polymer  were  to  increase  in 

strength  by  a  factor  of  10,  and  the  device  were  made  10  times  longer,  the  phase  shift 

achieved  with  the  modest  powers  we  have  used  would  be  about  π.  We  believe  it 

probable that such improvements can be made, rendering this device practical as a high-

 

10 

extinction and high-bandwidth all-optical modulator.  Furthermore, resonant effects can 

be used to enhance the nonlinearity of these devices. 

One practical device that could be built based on this mechanism is a high-bandwidth 

wavelength  converter.  That  is,  we  could  design  a  device  that  would  take  an  intensity 

modulation  at  one  wavelength,  and  transfer  that  modulation  to  another  carrier 

wavelength. We can  imagine a fiber-optical communications system in which a high-

speed  intensity  modulation  at  a  wavelength  such  as  1480  nm  must  be  transferred  to 

another wavelength at 1550 nm. A converter based on our  nonlinear modulator would 

have  several  advantages.  First,  it  would  not  require  any  high-speed  electronics,  as  the 

conversion mechanism occurs entirely in the optical domain.  Such a device would have 

an  exceptionally  high  bandwidth.  Of  course,  if  the  optical  nonlinearity  were  strong 

enough  to  enable  π  of  phase  shift,  we  could  conceivably  perform  this  conversion  via 

four-wave mixing in a single straight waveguide. In that case, however, we would have 

to  solve  the  problem  of  nearly  exactly  matching  the  effective  index  at  two  different 

wavelengths — a task  that is extremely challenging in waveguides such as this. Even 

for pulse streams at 10 GHz, this phase matching condition would be just as serious a 

problem  as  at  the  much  higher  speeds.  By  contrast,  our  device,  based  on  a  Mach–

Zehnder interferometer,   does not have this limitation, and begins to suffer   ill effects 

on  performance  from  the  dispersion  of  the  waveguide  only  as  switching  speeds  of  1 

THz  are  approached.    Such  a  device  could  be  particularly  desirable  for  low-latency 

applications,  where  the  delay  associated  with  an  O-E  and  E-O  conversion  is 

unacceptable.  For a 1-cm path-length device, we would expect delays on the scale of 

hundreds  of  picoseconds,  whereas  electronic  E-O  and  O-E  converters  will  typically 

have latency numbers  of nanoseconds or more23.  

 

11 

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  ultrafast  intensity  modulation  in  a  silicon-based 

device that takes advantage of the high modefield confinement in silicon waveguides, as 

well  as  the  high  nonlinearity  of  optical-polymer  materials.  As  performances  are 

improved,  this  type  of  device  may  find  wide  application  in  the  data  communications 

market,  particularly  in  very  high  bandwidth/low-latency  applications.  Moreover,  we 

believe that all-optical modulation of this nature is an important first step to all-optical 

logic and computation. We are able to measure the intensity modulation directly up to 

only  the  10-GHz  regime,  due  to  equipment  limitations;  however,  based  on  spectral 

measurements, we are confident that we have shown that an ultrafast nonlinearity is the 

mechanism  of  intensity-modulation  transfer,  and  that    the  device    functions  as  an 

intensity modulator into the terahertz.

Figure 1: Device Layout  Panel A shows a logical diagram of the operation of the high-

speed  all-optical  modulator.  The  gate  (red)  signal  has  its  intensity  modulation 

transferred to the source (blue) signal via nonlinear phase modulation in one arm of the 

Mach–Zehnder  interferometer.  Panel  B  shows  an  optical-microscope  image  of  part  of 

the  actual  device.  Panel  C  shows  the  mode  pattern  of  the  optical  signal  in  the 

waveguide. Contours are drawn in 10-percent increments of power.

Figure  2:  Gigahertz  Modulation  Data  Panel  A  shows  the  logical  diagram  of  the 

experiment  to  measure  the  optical  S  parameter.  Panel  B  shows  the  measured  S 

parameter for the device in various circumstances. The red curve is the measured value 

of  the  S  parameter  when  both  the  gate  and  source  lasers  are  on.  The    control 

measurements — taken when the signal laser is off, when the pump is off, and when all 

lasers are off — are shown by the green, blue, and teal curves, respectively. Based on 

the spectral four-wave –mixing data shown in Figure 3, we can calculate that the optical 

S parameter associated with the ultrafast optical measurementsis –37 dB.  This level  is 

 

17 

shown in panel B as a black line.  Clearly, the 10 GHz S-parameter and the calculated 

S-parameter  from  the  terahertz  data  are  in  close  agreement.    Panels  C  and  D  show 

optical-spectrum 

traces 

taken 

for  various  sinusoidal 

radio-frequency–intensity 

modulations on the gate. The intensity modulation of the gate laser results in sidebands 

on the output, located near the source wavelength at the appropriate locations for each 

input-modulation  frequency.    Panel  D  shows  a  detail  of  the  device  output  near  the 

source wavelength for modulation at 10 GHz, 15 GHz, and 20 GHz.

Figure 3: Four-Wave–Mixing Experiments Panel A shows the logical diagram of the 

experiment.  Panels  B,  C,  and  D  show  the  spectral  output  in  the  optical-spectrum 

analyzer for gate-laser spacings of 2.6 THz, 0.6 THz and 0.25 THz, respectively. The 

gate lasers are labelled λ0, λ1; the source signal is labelled λs. For the 2.6 THz plot, the 

relevant  wavelength  values  are      λ0=1544.3  nm,  λ1=1565.6    nm,  and  λs=1569.3  nm.  

The  primary  four-wave  mixing  sideband  of  the  source  signal  is  labelled  λm.    Several 

other  four-wave  mixing  peaks  are  visible.  In  addition,  an  inset  in  panel  D  shows  the 

detail of the source and one set of sidebands as the former is tuned in increments of 0.2 

 

19 

nm. The change in the intensity of the central peak as the source wavelength is tuned, 

but  not  of  the  sidebands,  is  characteristic  of  the  Mach–Zehnder  interferometer’s  

behavior.

Nonlinear Phase-Modulation Mechanism 

To  understand the limitations of the nonlinear phase-modulation mechanism, we must 

consider both the waveguide loss and the dispersion of our waveguides. Together, these 

two parameters establish a limitation on the amount of phase shift that can be obtained, 

or  the  rate  of  change  of  the  phase  shift  that  can  occur.  Our  waveguide  loss  has  been 

extensively calibrated through other test structures, and is known to be –7 dB/cm. The 

effective index of these waveguides near 1550 nm is well modelled by

As noted, this expression   corresponds to a group velocity dispersion of about –2000 ps 

nm-1km-1, a value typically encountered for such waveguides. Note that, unlike a device 

dependant  on  four-wave–mixing  conversion,  in  our  device  the  momentum  mismatch 

noted  in  Equation  2  does  not  affect  the  phase  shift  experienced  by  the  source 

wavelength. Thus, the only limitation on the bandwidth of the device is the tendency of 

a  pulse  to  scatter  based  on  dispersion,  and  the  tendency  of  pulses  on  different 

wavelengths to travel at different velocities. It is straightforward, using Fourier analysis, 

to analyze the time-domain behaviour of such pulses in the waveguide. The pulses used 

in the simulation shown in Figure 4 (supporting materials) were constrained to fit within 

 

0.5  THz  of  the  carrier  signal,  and  the  carrier  signals  were  separated  by  1.1  THz, 

ensuring that both pulses could propagate in the same waveguide and remain distinct.

How we  proceed  depends on the particular nonlinear process under study. In the case

The  final  term,  is  simply  a  measure  of  the  momentum  mismatch  among    the  three 

waves.  With  the  dispersion  roughly  known  for  our  waveguides  from  simulation  and 

experiment,    at  scales  around  1  cm  length,  and  for  frequencies  less  than  10  THz,  this 

mismatched  value  is  not  significant,  and  the  integral  is  nearly  equal  to  L.  This  could 

also  be  deduced  from  the  empirically  observed  fact  that  the  four-wave  mixing 

conversion  efficiency  did  not  vary  substantially  as  a  function  of  the  magnitude  of  the 

difference frequency, at least for differences up to 1 THz.  

Under this assumption (|a1|=|a0|), and under the condition that the two laser beams are 

nearly equal in power, the experimentally measured f fraction is then

In  the  case  where  one  beam  (ω2)  is  intensity  modulated  by  another  beam  (ω1),  the

Thus  it  turns  out  that,  as  seen  by  beam  2,  propagation  amounts  to  multiplication  by  a 

complex  value  with  modulus  1.  The  absolute  value  of  the  argument  of  this  value  is 

readily seen to be twice f. That is,

Finally, note that the expression used in equation 4 was twice this amount: 

f4

. The 

value is doubled because the measured f is artificially suppressed by a factor of ¼ due to 

the light passing through the final 3-dB coupler.  The produced sideband is reduced by 3 

dB, while the signal laser, because we biased the Mach–Zehnder modulator at max, is 

magnified by 3 dB.

Modelling of Pulses in the Time Domain 

It is straightforward to analyze numerically the dispersion of a time-domain pulse in a 

dispersive  waveguide;  in  Figure  4,  we  use  the  model  for  the  refractive  index  of  our 

waveguide to predict the time-domain behaviour of pulses at various speeds. The crucial 

question is whether the speed of a pulse at a gate wavelength will be sufficiently close  

to that of a pulse in the source wavelength to enable phase modulation by the nonlinear 

mechanism. In the simulations run, wavelengths at 1550 nm and 1541.2 nm were used. 

These wavelengths have a separation of 1.1 THz,  ensuring that they can be separated 

spectrally without destruction of the signal being carried. For a device length of 1 cm, 

even  for  pulses  of  1  ps  in  width  —  that  is,  terahertz  pulses  —  the  pulses  are  largely 

unseparated.    Our  calculations    probably  give  a  conservative  estimate  of  the  pulse 

spreading; the waveguide loss in the real devices ensures that the majority of the phase-

shift transfer will occur in the first 0.5 cm of waveguide, whereas this simulation does 

not take that loss into account 

 

26 

 

Figure 4: Simulation of ultrafast time-domain behaviour Panel A shows the effective 

index as a function of wavelength, a value that is slightly concave upward, leading to a 

negative  group-velocity  dispersion  of  about  –2000  ps  nm-1  km-1.  Panels  B,  C,  and  D 

display what a time-domain–intensity detector would show at the start and end of the 1-

cm modulation regions, for various input pulses. The signal in red is 1550 nm; that in 

blue is at 1541.2 nm. For clarity, attenuation due to waveguide loss has been normalized 

out of the second set of pulses. No blue line can be seen in panel B, because the pulses 

are nearly on top of each other.

Abstract.  A  detailed  analysis  of the adiabatic-piston problem reveals peculiar dynamical features that 
challenge  the  general  belief  that  isolated  systems  necessarily  reach  a  static  equilibrium  state.  In 
particular,  the  fact  that  the  piston  behaves  like  a  perpetuum  mobile,  i.e.,  it  never  stops  but  keeps 
wandering, undergoing sizable oscillations, around the position corresponding to maximum entropy, has 
remarkable  implications on the entropy variations of the system and on the validity of the second law 
when dealing with systems of mesoscopic dimensions. 
 

The adiabatic-piston problem is a peculiar example in thermodynamics [1], which 
has recently been the object of renewed interest [2],[3]. We refer to the model case of 
an  adiabatic  cylinder  divided  into  two  regions  A  and  B  by  a  movable,  frictionless, 
perfectly insulating piston. Both A and B contain an equal amount of the same perfect 
gas. We assume the piston to be held up to time t=0 by latches, so that the gases in A 
and  B  are  initially  characterized  by  well-defined  equilibrium  states,  respectively 
corresponding  to  temperatures  and  volumes  TA=T1(0),  VA=  SX(0)  and  TB=T2(0), 
VB=S[L-X(0)], where S and L are the cylinder transverse area and length and X(0) is 
the initial piston position (see Fig.1).

   Once the latches are released, the piston starts moving and its dynamical evolution is 
described  by  means  of  a  suitable  kinetic  model  (see  Eqs.  (6),  (7),  (8)  of  [2]).  In 
particular, the solution of this set of coupled equations  allows one to predict the final 
position  reached  by  the  piston  for  large  values  of  time,  as  well  as  the  final 
temperatures  and  the  common  value  of  the  final  pressure,  quantities  which  are  not 
entirely  determinate  in  the  frame  of  elementary  thermodynamics  [1].  The  model 
considered in [2] describes situations in which the macroscopic pressure difference in 
A and B constitutes the main driving force on the piston, so that microscopic pressure 
fluctuations are consistently neglected. 
   We  wish  here  to  investigate  the  different  regime  associated  with  the  initial 
(cid:6)
0)0(X =
conditions corresponding to X(0)=L/2, 
 and to a common value of the initial 
pressure,  and  thus  of  the  initial  temperature,  in  A  and  B.  In  this  situation,  the 
fluctuating  microscopic  Langevin  force,  arising  from  the  random  nature  of  the 
collisions between the piston and the molecules on both sides, cannot be neglected. A 
preliminary  investigation  of  this  regime  [4]  has  revealed  the  presence  of  intriguing 
features. In particular, it has been shown that the piston, initially set in the symmetric 
position corresponding to equal temperatures on both sides and to maximum entropy 
of  the  gaseous  system,  undergoes  a  stochastic  motion  associated  with  relevant 
asymptotic  fluctuations  of  the  random  variable  [X(t)-L/2].  As  a  consequence,  the 
system  exhibits  negative  entropy  variations  which  can  be  much  larger  than  those 
associated  with  standard  thermal  fluctuations.  In  the  present  paper,  this  surprising 
result  is  confirmed  and  put  on  a  firmer  ground  by  numerically  investigating  the 
stochastic motion of the piston  after deriving the Langevin force by means of a simple 
application of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. 
   We start by recalling that X(t) obeys the non-linear stochastic equation (see Eq.(7) of 
[4])

   To  this  aim,  we  introduce  a  configuration  slightly  modified  with  respect  to  that 
sketched in Fig.1. More precisely, we consider a torus of section S (see Fig.2), filled 
with a perfect gas at thermal equilibrium at temperature T and pressure P, in which an 
adiabatic piston of mass M is free to slide without friction under the action of the gas. 
In  this  configuration,  the  equation  of  motion  of  the  piston  is  readily  obtained  in  the

   We assume Eq.(4) to represent the statistical properties of Langevin’s acceleration in 
our case, described by Eq.(1). In particular, the white-noise behavior is justified by the 
extremely  rapid  variations  of  A(t)  compared  to  those  of  dX/dt.  Therefore,  by  using 
Eq.(4)  and  introducing  the  characteristic  time  tp  =ML(p /16nRT0Mg)1/2  and  the 
dimensionless variables x =X/L and t =t/tp, Eq.(1) can be recast in its final form

represents a unitary-power white noise. The stochastic Eq.(5), describing the random 
motion of the piston, is the central result of this paper. 
   Before  attempting  a  numerical  analysis  of  Eq.(5),  we  recall  that  we  have  already 
obtained,  under  suitable  hypotheses,  approximate  analytical  solutions  [4].  More 
x -1/2‰ <<1, expanding accordingly the terms appearing on the 
precisely, by assuming ‰
left-hand side of Eq.(5) and approximating the square of the piston velocity 
 with 
its average thermal value KT0/M, we have been able to approximate Eq.(5) with that 
describing the Brownian motion of a harmonically bound particle of mass M, a system 
extensively discussed in the literature [6]. In particular, we have found that, for m <1, 
the  asymptotic  normalized  mean-square  average  position 
the  piston  reaches 
x<
/2  in a time tas@ Ntp. This implies that the piston does not stop, but 
(
keeps  wandering  around  its  initial  position  x =1/2  undergoing  random  oscillations 
whose amplitude is a sizable fraction of the cylinder length.  
   The results of the numerical analysis of Eq.(5) essentially agree with those worked 
out in [4], and allows us to extend the investigation of the piston dynamics over a wide 
range of system parameters. We adopt a second order stochastic leap-frog algorithm as 
developed  in  [7]  and  consider  103  realizations  of  the  piston.  As  an  example,  a 
preliminary  analysis  of  the  time  evolution  of 
  is  reported  in  Fig.3  for 
s =.01 and m =2 , together with the histogram of the statistical variable [x (t )-1/2)]2 for 
t =4000.    Its  inspection  clearly  shows  how  the  piston  undergoes  random  fluctuations 
around the central position x =1/2, which increase with time up to an asymptotic value 
corresponding  to  a  sizable  fraction  of  the  cylinder  length.  In  terms  of  dimensional

taking the average of the general expression D S worked out in [4] (see Eq.(5) of [4]),

   The asymptotic entropy decrease (see Fig. 4) turns out to be larger by two order of 
magnitude than the corresponding value associated with standard thermal fluctuations, 
which essentially confirms the violation of the second law in the mesoscopic regime 
obtained  in  [4].  We  note  that  this  result  does  not  contradict  Boltzmann’s  H-theorem 
since one of the main hypotheses underlying it, i.e., the molecular-chaos assumption, 
is not fulfilled by our system [4]. 
   We  wish  finally  to  observe  that  the  validity  of  our  model  could  be  fully  justified 
only on the basis of a suitable molecular dynamic simulation involving a considerable 
number  of  point  particles.  Recently,  molecular  simulations  have  been  carried  out,  in 
the frame of the adiabatic piston problem, by modelling the two gases with 500 hard

disks  separated  by  a  frictionless  piston  with  which  they  undergo  perfect  elastic 
collisions [9]. Actually, the authors do not investigate the behavior of <X2(t)>, but that 
of <X(t)>. More precisely, they consider situations in which X(0) is different from L/2 
and follow the evolution of the piston along the equal pressure line. In particular, they 
evaluate  the  relaxation  time over which <X(t)> asymptotically reaches the value L/2 
(in  our case, conversely, X(0)=L/2 so that, obviously, <X(t)>=L/2 at all times, while 
<[X(t)-L/2]2>  ranges  from  the  initial  value  zero  to  a  significant  asymptotic  value). 
Their relaxation time turns out to be, as a function of m =M/Mg, in good qualitative and 
quantitative agreement with our values of tas [4]. 
   In conclusion, we believe that we have placed into evidence an intriguing aspect of 
the  motion  of  a  frictionless  adiabatic  piston1  separating  two  gases  in  an  adiabatic 
cylinder.  In  particular,  for  mesoscopic  time  and  space  scales  where  the  hypotheses 
underlying  our  model  seem  more  realistic,  the  piston  never  stops  but  undergoes 
relevant  random  fluctuations  around  its  initial  position  X(0)=L/2.  As a consequence, 
this  perpetuum  mobile  induces  a  violation  of  the  second  law,  in  the  sense  that  the 
entropy  of  our  isolated  system  decreases  a  few  order  of  magnitude  over  standard 
thermal fluctuations.

1  The  term  “adiabatic”  requires  a  clarification.  Actually,  the  random  motion  undergone  by  the  piston 
subjects both gases to random impulses. This is in a sense equivalent to permitting heat to flow. Thus, 
in our case, the term adiabatic only  means that the internal degrees of freedom of the piston cannot be 
excited so that the piston is perfectly reflecting, as well as the side walls of the cylinder

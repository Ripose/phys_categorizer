Two devices for subwave length focusing of light are explored. The first one is a thin film of a well 
c
reflecting metal which the converging beam of surface plasmons with a wave number

device  is  a  linear  nanoantenna  with  a  gap  in  the  middle.  A  resonance  plasmon  is  excited  in  the 
0λ . In both cases 
the effect of field enhancement in the spot of subwave length focusing is greatly decreased because 
of propagation losses in the first case and because of a small excitation cross section in the second 
case. It is suggested to improve on the effect of excitation of the film and the nanoantenna by means 
of interaction with an adjacent atom or quantum dot. 

antenna. The field in the gap concentrates on the spot that is much smaller than

There are two recent proposals on how to focus light into a spot that would be much smaller than a wave 

 
 
length. The first proposal could be found in the Internet as titles of lectures that the famous Professor E. Yablonovitch 
delivered in 2006 at some meetings. The titles are "Plasmonics: Optical Frequencies but with X-ray Wavelengths" and 
"What is the Limit of Focusing Light ?" /2/. The mentioned lectures are accessible by the titles and abstracts only. 
Unfortunately the abstracts contain a poor quantity of information. The substantial information could be found in a 
photo that is presented at the site of The 89th OSA Annual Meeting Frontiers in Optics 2005 & Laser Science XXI 
Conference, October 16-20, 2005. The reconstruction of the photo is on the Fig. 1 below. It is seen that it is a device 
with a surface plasmons that the author would keep in mind.

The second proposal could be found in the paper by Professor D. W. Pohl and coauthors /3/. They demonstrated the 
light localization on a spot of 
 by a device that is called a resonant optical antenna. A sketch of the 
antenna is shown in Fig. 2. It is an Au small thin strip with a gap in the middle on a glass substrate. The field in the 
gap is greatly enhanced.

In the Yablonovitch's device it is a light beam that is focused on a uniform thin metal film. In the focus spot 
0~λ  diameter there is a diffraction grating that consists of a set of cuts of concentric circles. The diffraction

is much smaller than the dimension of the initial focusing spot. 
  
middle. The strip was placed in a focal spot of a conventional lens. A conversion of the laser light (830 nm pulses of a 
duration 8 ps) into intense white light was observed. The mechanisms underlying the effect are not well known. 
However the authors are sure that the effect points unambiguously to a very high intensity of the field in the gap. 
 
Let discuss in details the peculiar features of the mentioned devices. In the Yablonovitch's device the key 
element is the film with a converging beam of surface plasmons. It is possible to excite an optical plasmon with a 
wave length as short as 10 nm on surfaces of Ag and Au films /4,5/. This plasmon has the wave length many times as 
short as compared to a wave in vacuum of the same frequency. Great additional shortening of the plasmon wave 
length could be accomplished if the metal film would be covered by a dielectric layer of ε that is lower but close to 
the module ε of the metal /5/.  
 
existent contemporary technologies /6/. Though small surface inhomogeneities should not produce any difficulty 
because they emit radiation poorly. 
 

Au films and very probably Ag films as thin as 0.5 nm without an island structure can be produced by the

There are various means for describing a focusing phenomenon. It is convenient to do this by a concept of a 
Gaussian beam. A Gaussian beam arises as a solution of the Helmholtz equation in the paraxial approximation /7,8/. 
On a flat surface separating two substances surface plasmons present by themselves plain waves however so called 
nonuniform or evanescent waves. They are of a variable amplitude along the wave front. Besides the plasmon field 
has different descriptions on two sides of the separating surface. The description of a Gaussian beam of surface 
plasmons was not found as yet by us in the special literature.  
 
component, namely a transverse 

Below it will be a so called TM - plasmon under a consideration. This plasmon has a single magnetic 

xH  component parallel to the separating surface, see Fig. 3. The electric field has 

two components: a transverse 

yE  component that is a normal to the separating surface and a longitudinal 

zE  

component parallel to the separating surface. There are two such plasmons symmetric (s-plasmon) and 
antisimmetric (a-plasmon) on a thin film. The highly slowed plasmon that is of a short wave length is an a-plasmon. 
It is an a-plasmon that will be dealed with below.

On seeing these results a possibility to produce a subwave length focusing seems to be achievable. 
 
However the Gaussian beam in the device under the discussion has great dimensions being measured in the plasmon 
wave length. It is of 30-100 wave length in cross section and 300-1000 wave length long along the axis. The 
question how high would be the losses appears.

The efficiency of the

In conclusion, two types of devices of subwave light focusing are considered. The 1st one presents by itself

The field in the gap concentrates on a spot much less than

0λ . In the 1st case as well as in the 2nd case a great 

intensification of the field in the focusing spot appears. However the total power in the output spot is decreased due 
to propagation losses in the 1st case and due to a small value of the antenna excitation cross section in the 2nd case. 
The effect of the film or antenna excitation could be increased by the excitation of the adjacent atom or quantum 
dot.

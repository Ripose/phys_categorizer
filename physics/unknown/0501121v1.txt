Abbreviated title: Pattern Informatics for Earthquake Forecast 

3 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

Abstract-Pattern  informatics  (PI)  technique  can  be  used  to  detect  precursory  seismic 

activation or quiescence and make earthquake forecast.    Here we apply the PI method for 

optimal forecasting of large earthquakes in Japan, using the data catalogue maintained by 

the Japan Meteorological Agency.    The PI method is tested to forecast large (magnitude m

(cid:16096) 5) earthquakes for the time period 1995-2004 in the Kobe region.    Visual inspection and 

statistical  testing  show  that  the  optimized  PI  method  has  forecasting  skill,  relative  to  the 

seismic  intensity  data  often  used  as  a  standard  null  hypothesis.    Moreover,  we  find  a 

retrospective  forecast  that  the  1995  Kobe  earthquake  (m (cid:14996)  7.2)  falls  in  a  seismically 

anomalous  area.    Another  approach  to  test  the  forecasting  algorithm  is  to  create  a  future 

potential map for large (m (cid:16096) 5) earthquake events.    This is illustrated using the Kobe and 

Tokyo  regions  for  the  forecast  period  2000-2009.    Based  on  the  resulting  Kobe  map  we 

point  out  several  forecasted  areas:  the  epicentral  area  of  the  1995  Kobe  earthquake,  the 

Wakayama area, the Mie area, and the Aichi area.    The Tokyo forecasted map was created 

prior to the occurrence of the Oct. 23, 2004 Niigata earthquake (m = 6.8) and the principal 

aftershocks with 5.0 (cid:148) m.    We find that these events occurred in a forecasted area in the

Introduction 

Earthquakes  have  great  scientific,  societal,  and  economic  significance.    The  17  Jan. 

1995 Kobe, Japan, earthquake (hereinafter referred as the 1995 Kobe earthquake) was only 

a magnitude m = 7.2 event and yet killed nearly 6,000 persons and produced an estimated 

$200 billion loss.    Similar scenarios are possible at any time in San Francisco, Seattle, and 

other U.S. urban centers along the Pacific plate boundary.    The magnitude of potential loss 

of life and property is so great that reliable earthquake forecasting should be at the forefront 

of research goals, especially in Japan.     

Millions  of  dollars  and  thousands  of  work  years  have  been  spent  on  observational 

programs  searching  for  reliable  precursory  phenomena.    Possible  precursory  phenomena 

include  changes  in  seismicity,  changes  in  seismic  velocity,  tilt  and  strain  precursors, 

electromagnetic  signals,  hydrologic  phenomena,  and  chemical  emissions  (TURCOTTE,

1991;  SCHOLZ,  2002).    For  example,  TSUNOGAI  and  WAKITA  (1995,  1996)  found  that 

the ion concentrations of ground water issuing from deep wells located near the epicenter of 

6 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

the  1995  Kobe  earthquake  showed  precursory  phenomena  (See  also  JOHNANSEN et  al.,

1996).    A few successes have been reported, but, to date, no precursors to large earthquake 

have  been  detected  that  would  provide  reliable  forecasts  (Nature  Debates,  Denoted  on 

earthquake forecasting, http://www.nature.com/nature/debates/earthquake/, 1999).     

The  Earth’s  crust  is  clearly  extremely  complex  and  it  is  generally  accepted  that 

earthquakes  are  a  chaotic  phenomenon.    Thus,  as  in  the  case  of  weather  forecasting, 

earthquake forecasting must be considered on a statistical basis (RUNDLE et al., 2003).    A 

fundamental question is whether the statistical properties of seismicity patterns can be used 

to  forecast  future  earthquakes.    Premonitory  seismicity  patterns  were  found  for  some 

strong  earthquakes  in  California  and  Nevada  using  algorithm  “CN”  and  for  m  >  8 

worldwide  using  algorithm  “M8”  (e.g.,  KEILIS-BOROK,  1990;  KEILIS-BOROK  and 

ROTWAIN,  1990;  KEILIS-BOROK  and  KOSSOBOKOV,  1990;  KEILIS-BOROK  and 

SOLOVIEV, 2003).   

Alternatively,  a  new  approach  to  earthquake  forecasting,  the  pattern  informatics  (PI) 

approach,  has  been  proposed  by  RUNDLE et  al.  (2002),  TIAMPO et  al.  (2002a,  b,  c),  and 

7 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

HOLLIDAY et al. (2004a, b).    This approach is based on the strong space-time correlations 

that  are  responsible  for  the  cooperative  behavior  of  driven  threshold  systems  and  arises 

both  from  threshold  dynamics  as  well  as  from  the  mean  field  (long  range)  nature  of  the 

interactions.    The  PI  technique  can  be  used  to  detect  precursory  seismic  activation  or 

quiescence and make earthquake forecasts.    Applications to earthquake data from southern 

California show that the PI method is a powerful technique for forecasting large events, but 

no one has attempted to apply this method to Japanese earthquakes.    Moreover, it will be 

interesting to test whether the 1995 Kobe earthquake could have been forecasted using the 

method. 

The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  study  the  applicability  of  the  pattern  informatics  (PI) 

algorithm  for  forecasting  large  earthquakes  in  Japan.    As  an  example,  we  will  present  a 

forecast of large (m (cid:149) 5) earthquakes during the time period 1995-2004 in the Kobe region: 

the region that includes the epicenter of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.    First, we will briefly 

introduce  the  PI  method.    Next,  we  will  describe  the  earthquake  catalogues  used  in  this 

paper.    Carrying out visual inspections and statistical testing, we will find that the method 

8 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

can  has  more  precision  in  forecasting  large  earthquakes  than  a  simple  look  at  where 

earthquakes have occurred in the past.    Then, we will find a retrospective forecast that the 

1995 Kobe earthquake fall into a seismically anomalous area.     

The true test of the forecasting algorithm is to make a future forecast that proves correct.   

TIAMPO et al. (2002b), RUNDLE et al. (2002, 2003), and HOLLIDAY et al. (2004a) did this 

for  the  period  of  2000-2009  in  Southern  California.    In  this  paper  we  will  also  make  a 

future forecast in the time period from 2000 to 2009 for two regions: the Kobe region and 

the Tokyo region in which the Tokyo metropolitan area is included.    This paper will show 

considerable  promise  as  an  intermediate-term  event  forecasting  tool  for  Japanese 

earthquakes.     

2. Pattern Informatics 

The PI approach is a six step process that creates a time-dependent system state vector 

in a real valued Hilbert space and uses the phase angle to predict future states (RUNDLE et

9 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

al., 2003).    The method is based on the idea that the future time evolution of sesmicity can 

be described by pure phase dynamics (MORI and KURAMOTO, 1998; RUNDLE et al., 2000a, 

b).    This PI method was originally developed by TIAMPO et al. (2002b).    HOLLIDAY et

al.  (2004a)  showed  that  the  modified  PI  method  recently  proposed  by  KLEIN  (2004)  has 

better forecasting skills than the original method.    Here we use the modified PI method for 

forecasting large earthquakes in Japan. 

First  the  study  area  is  divided  into  N  square  boxes.    The  center  of  the  i-th  box  is 

denoted  by 

  and  each  box  has  an  edge  length 

x(cid:39) .    The  seismic  intensity  in  box  i  is

  in the box during the period from

10 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

Values of the average rate of occurrence of earthquakes in box i are obtained by taking the 

tb values at daily intervals from t0 to t-1.    These values are averaged to give its mean value

value for the time period t0 to t1 (> t0) from the normalized mean value for the time period t0

to t2 (> t1)

  to  forecast  earthquakes  is  referred  to  as  pattern  informatics.   

Forecasts should convey information for time t in the range: t3 > t > t2.    We call the time 

interval t2 – t1 the “change interval” and the interval t3 – t2 the “forecast interval”.    In this 

paper, to improve performance, the PI method is optimized by adjusting the length of the 

change interval (t2 – t1) and the initial time t0.         

3. Application of PI Method 

We  use  a  seismic  catalog  maintained  by  the  Japan  Meteorological  Agency  (JMA).   

13 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

This catalog includes the data of earthquakes with m (cid:116)   0 for the time period since 1923 in 

and  around  Japan.    The  relevant  data  consists  of  time,  magnitude,  and  location  given  by 

east  longitude,  north  latitude,  and  depth.    To  ensure  the  completeness  of  the  earthquake 

catalog,  events  of  magnitude  equal  to  or  larger  than  the  lower  cut-off  magnitude  mc  =  3 

with depth shallower than 20 km in the time period from Jan. 1, 1955 to the present (as of 

Mar. 14, 2004) are selected.     

To  apply  the  PI  method  to  Japanese  earthquakes  we  need  to  determine 

x(cid:39) .

Following  TIAMPO et  al.  (2002b)  we  use 

x(cid:39)   =  0.1°  (cid:124)   11  km.    Boxes  of  this  size 

correspond roughly to the linear scale size of m (cid:124)   5 – 6 earthquakes.    We try to forecast 

earthquakes of m (cid:149) 5.    The idea is to use information on small events having spatial scales 

(cid:499) < 

x(cid:39)   to forecast the occurrence of large events having scales (cid:499) > 

x(cid:39) .     

We are also interested in a retrospective forecast of the 1995 Kobe earthquake (m = 7.2).   

The epicenter was 135.03° east longitude and 34.58° north latitude with the depth of 16 km.   

This earthquake produced a surface rupture with a length of about 9 km appearing along the 

pre-existing right lateral Nojima fault.    Six aftershocks having magnitude m (cid:149) 5 followed 

14 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

the main shock along this fault.     

To  examine  whether  our  forecasting  capability  is  changed  if  the  size  of  our  study 

regions is changed, we consider 5 study regions: the extent of these regions is changed but 

they have the same center which is near the epicenter of the 1995 Kobe earthquake.    Table 

1 summarizes the study regions.    The regions 4 and 5 include the epicenter of the Oct. 6, 

2000 Tottori earthquake of m = 7.3 (hereinafter referred to as the 2000 Tottori earthquake).   

The epicentre was 133.35° east longitude and 35.27° north latitude with a depth of 9 km.   

Before discussing PI method forecast for Kobe region during the period 1995-2004 we 

describe  earthquake  data  from  the  Tokyo  region  (No.  6  in  Table  1).    The  analyzed 

earthquake  data  is  from  the  region  between  136.0-142.0°  east  longitude  and  between 

33.0-38.0° north latitude (depth shallower than 20 km).    The Tokyo metropolitan area is 

located at the center of region 6.    Eighty-two earthquakes having m (cid:149) 5 occurred for the 

period  Jan.  1,  2000-the  present  (Mar.  14,  2004).    An  earthquake  swarm  associated  with 

Miyake  volcano  started  on  Jun.  26,  2000  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  2000  Miyake 

earthquake swarm).    Since then there have been 74 earthquakes with 5.0 (cid:148) m < 6.0 and six 

earthquakes  with  6.0  (cid:148) m.    This  swarm  is  located  at  about  33.8-34.3°  north  latitude  and

15 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

139.0-139.5° east longitude. 

4.1 Visual Inspection 

The PI approach to forecasting large earthquakes in the Kobe region during the period 

Jan.  1,  1995-  Mar.  14,  2004  is  best  illustrated  using  a  specific  example.    A  PI-method 

optimal forecast of earthquake occurrence in region 4 is given in Figure 1.    In applying the 

method to the N = 1500 0.1°  (cid:117)   0.1°  (cid:117)   20 km boxes with mc = 3, the times used are t0 = 

Jan. 1, 1960, t1 = Jan. 1, 1968, t2 = Dec. 31, 1994, and t3 = Mar. 14, 2004.    The t2-value is 

just  before  the  occurrence  of  the  1995  Kobe  earthquake.    In  region  4,  there  are  18 

earthquakes having m (cid:149) 5 occurring in the period 1995-2004.

represent regions of anomalously high seismic activation or high seismic quiescence.    The

future  earthquakes  out  of  18  occur  either  on  areas  of  forecasted  anomalous  activity  or 

within  the  margin  of  error  of  11  km  (the  coarse  grained  box  size).    Note  that  the  1995 

Kobe  earthquake  (123.0°  East  long.,  34.6°  North  lat.)  and  the  2000  Tottori  earthquake 

(133.4° East long., 35.3° North lat.) fall into warmer coloured anomalies.

large (m (cid:1158)  5) earthquakes in the change interval (triangles, t1 < t < t2) and forecast interval 

(circles, t2 < t < t3) are included in this figure.    Comparing Figures 1 and 2 shows that the 

optimized PI method narrows the possible locations where large earthquakes are expected.     

We also carry out visual inspections for the other regions (Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 5 in Table 1).   

17 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

We take t0 = Jan. 1, 1960, t1 = Jan. 1, 1968, t2 = Dec. 31, 1994, and t3 = Mar. 14, 2004 as 

done  for  region  4.    We  find  that  the  1995  Kobe  earthquake  again  falls  into  one  of  the 

colour  coded  areas.    Moreover,  for  region  5  the  2000  Tottori  earthquake  also  falls  in  a 

colour  coded  area.    These  visual  inspections  substantiate  that  the  1995  Kobe  earthquake 

falls in the forecast area     

4.2 Statistical Testing 

Visual  inspection  of  Figure  1  shows  that  the  retrospective  forecast  is  reasonably 

successful,  but  rigorous  statistical  testing  is  needed.    For  a  null  hypothesis,  we  use  the 

actual  seismic  intensity  data  in  the  time  period  from  t0  to  t2

intensity data has been proposed for the standard null hypothesis (KAGAN and JACKSON,

2000).    This  hypothesis  was  used  for  testing  the  PI  forecast  for  southern  California 

earthquakes (TIAMPO et al., 2002a). 

18 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

To  test  the  PI  method  forecast  we  utilize  the  maximum  likelihood  test.    This  is 

accepted  as  the  standard  approach  of  testing  earthquake  forecasts  (e.g.,  BEVINGTON  and 

ROBINSON,  1992;  GROSS  and  RUNDLE,  1998;  KAGAN  and  JACKSON,  2000; 

SCHORLEMMER et  al.,  2003).    This  test  is  used  to  evaluate  the  accuracy  with  which 

probability  measure 

  can  forecast  future  (t2  <  t  <  t3)  large  (m (cid:1158)   5)  events,

relative  to  forecast  from  the  null  hypothesis.    The  likelihood  L  is  a  probability  measure 

that can be used to assess the utility of one forecast measure over another.    Typically, one 

computes the logarithm of the likelihood (

log

L10

) for the proposed measure L and compare 

that to the likelihood measure LN for a representative null hypothesis.    The ratio of these 

two  values  then  yields  information  about  which  measure  is  more  accurate  in  forecasting 

future events.   

In  the  likelihood  test,  a  probability  density  function  is  required.    Following 

HOLLIDAY et al. (2004a, b), we use a global Gaussian model and a local Poissonian model 

in our study.    The use of the global Gaussian model was proposed for test the PI method 

forecast (TIAMPO et al., 2002a).    The second model used is based on work performed by 

19 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

the  Regional  Earthquake  Likelihood  Methods  (RELM)  group  (SCHORLEMMER et  al.,

2003).    The likelihood values for the PI method forecast are defined as LG for the global 

Gaussian model and LP for the local Poissonian model.    Similarly, the likelihoods for the 

null  hypothesis  are  defined  as  LGN  for  the  global  Gaussian  model  and  LPN  for  the  local 

Poissonian model.     

We  first  take  the  global  Gaussian  model.    Then  we  compute  the  log-likelihood 

log10  (LG)  for  the  forecast  of  Figure  1  and  the  log-likelihood  log10  (LGN)  for  the  seismic 

intensity  map  in  Figure  2.    The  results  are  summarized  in  the  row  of  No.  4  in  Table  1  .   

The computed log-likelihood log10 (LG) = -47.0 is larger than the log-likelihood log10 (LGN)

=  -58.9.    Next  we  take  the  local  Poissonian  model.    As  done  for  the  global  Gaussian 

model, the log-likelihoods are computed for the forecast of Figure 1, log10 (LP) = -64.7, and 

for  the  seismic  intensity  map  in  Figure  2,  log10  (LPN)  =  -108.7  (Table  1).    The  value  of 

log10  (LP)  is  larger  than  that  of  log10  (LPN).    Since  larger  values  of  the  log-likelihoods 

indicate  a  more  successful  hypothesis,  the  logical  conclusion  is  that  the  optimized  PI 

method has better forecast skill than the actual seismic intensity data.     

20 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

We  also  carry  out  statistical  testing  for  the  other  regions  (Nos.  1,  2,  3,  and  5  in 

Table 1).    We take t0 = Jan. 1, 1960, t1 = Jan. 1, 1968, t2 = Dec. 31, 1994, and t3 = Mar. 14, 

2004 as done for the visual inspections.    We first take the global Gaussian model.    For all 

regions we find that the log-likelihood log10 (LG) is larger than that log10 (LGN).    We next 

take local Poissonian model.    We again find that the log-likelihood log10 (LP) is larger than 

thatlog10  (LPN)  for  all  regions.    These  results  support  our  conclusion  that  the  method  has 

forecasting skill. 

5. Forecasting large earthquakes for the period 2000-2009 in the Kobe and Tokyo regions 

TIAMPO et al. (2002b) and RUNDLE et al. (2002, 2003) proposed that the true test of 

any forecasting algorithm is to make a future forecast that proves correct.    The diffusive, 

mean field nature of the dynamics (FISHER et al., 1997; FERGUSON et al., 1997; RUNDLE

et  al.,  2000b;  KAGAN  and  JACKSON,  2000)  leads  to  a  hypothesis  that  forecasts  should 

convey  information  for  time  t  approximately  in  the  range:  t3  {=  t2  +  (t2  -  t1)}  >  t  >  t2.

21 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

According  to  this  hypothesis,  previous  studies  (RUNDLE et  al.,  2003;  TIAMPO et  al.,

2002a;  HOLLIDAY et  al.,  2004)  took  the  length  of  the  change  interval  to  be  equal  to  the 

length of the forecast interval for future large event forecast during the period of 2000-2009 

in Southern California.    Here we also do this for a future forecast in the period from 2000 

to 2009 (t3 - t2 = 10 years) for the Tokyo and Kobe regions.    For both regions, we assume 

that t3 - t2 = t2 – t1 = 10 years.    That is, the times used are t1 = Jan. 1, 1989 and t2 = Dec. 31, 

1999.    We  optimize  the  initial  time t0  for  the  forecasting  large  earthquakes  in  the  period 

from Jan. 1, 2000 to Mar. 14, 2004 by using statistical testing.     

5.1 Kobe Region 

We  first  consider  the  Kobe  region  (No.  4  in  Table  1)  where  there  are  6  earthquakes 

having m (cid:149) 5 occurring in the period 2000-2004.    Statistical testing using local Gaussian 

and local Poissonian models indicates that the time t0 is optimized to be t0 = 1980 (years) 

for region 4.    Our forecast map is shown in Figure 3.    We use times t1 = Jan. 1, 1989 and 

22 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

t2  =  Dec.  31,  1999  with  the  optimized  initial  time  t0  =  Jan.  1,  1980.    Values  of

  are given using the same color code as in Figure 1.    Inverted 

triangles are events, m (cid:1158)  5, during 1989-1999.    Events of m (cid:1158)  5 that occurred between 

Jan.  1  2000  to  Mar.  14,  2004  are  plotted  with  circles.    The  2000  Tottori  earthquake 

(133.4°  East  long.,  35.3°  North  lat.)  again  falls  into  one  of  the  forecasted  areas.    This 

figure calls attention to regions that seem to be at risk for larger earthquakes having m (cid:1158)  5 

during  2000-2009.    The  regions  most  at  risk  (orange  and  red  coloured)  include  the 

epicentral area of the 1995 Kobe earthquake approximately located at 135.0° east longitude 

and 34.5° north latitude, the Wakayama area approximately located at 135.1° east longitude 

and 34.0° north latitude, the Mie area approximately located at 136.1° east longitude and 

34.3° north latitude, and the Aichi area approximately located at 136.5° east longitude and 

35.2° north latitude. 

23 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

5.2 Tokyo Region 

Next  the  PI  method  is  applied  for  forecasting  large  future  earthquakes  in  the  Tokyo 

region.    Since the Sep. 1, 1923 Kanto earthquake (m = 7.9) that killed more than 140,000 

people,  the  Tokyo  region  has  spent  a  seismically  quiet  period  (e.g.,  RIKITAKE,  1990).   

However, earthquakes that could inflict disaster on the Tokyo region were pointed out (e.g., 

MOGI,  1985).    Moreover,  using  the  exponential  probability  distribution  model  for 

recurrence  times,  FERRAES  (2003)  estimated  that  a  damaging  earthquake  (m (cid:149)  6.4)  may 

occur before the year June 2009.    In these circumstances, it will be interesting to make the 

PI hazard map for forecasting large (m (cid:149) 5) future (2000-2009) earthquakes for the Tokyo 

region.     

As was done for the Kobe region, we assume times t1 = Jan. 1, 1989 and t2 = Dec. 31, 

1999  and  utilize  initial  time  t0  that  is  optimized  for  the  forecast  of  large  (m (cid:149)  5)  large 

quakes in the period from Jan. 1, 2000 to the present (Mar. 14, 2004) by the statistical tests.   

The optimized value is t0 = Jan. 1, 1965.    The forecast map is shown in Figure 4.    Values

  are given using the color code as in Figure 2.    Earthquakes 

with  m (cid:149)  5  in  the  change  and  forecast  intervals  are  represented  by  inverted  triangles  and 

circles, respectively.    The 2000 Miyake earthquake swarm falls in colour coded anomalies 

in  Figure  4.    For  comparison,  the  spatial  distribution  of  relative  seismic  intensities  for 

region 6 for the time period 1965 to 1999 is given in Figure 5.    The relative intensity is

  where t0 = Jan. 1, 1965 and t2 = Dec. 31, 1999.     

The forecast map in Figure 4 was first presented by one of the authors (JBR) at a lecture 

on  Oct.  13,  2004  at  Kyoto  Univ.,  Japan  (Organizer:  Professor  James  Mori,  Kyoto  Univ.) 

and at the International Conference on Geodynamics held on Oct. 14-16, 2004 at the Univ. 

of Tokyo, Japan (Organizer: Professor Mitsuhiro Matsu’ura, University of Tokyo).    After 

this appearance, the Oct. 23, 2004 Niigata earthquake of m = 6.8 (hereinafter referred to as 

the 2004 Niigata earthquake) occurred.    The epicenter was 138.7° east longitude and 37.3° 

north latitude and the depth was 16 km.    Large aftershocks with 5.0 (cid:148) m occurred around 

the hypocenter of this earthquake.    Figure 6 is the same as Figure 4 but these events are 

added  in  Figure  6.    Note  that  the  2004  Niigata  earthquake  and  its  aftershocks  fall  into  a 

25 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

colour  coded  anomaly,  this  indicates  that  the  method  may  have  considerable  promise  for 

forecasting future large earthquakes in Japan.    Future monitoring of the Tokyo and Kobe 

regions will test the accuracy and reliability of our PI studies.     

6. Conclusion

We have utilized the pattern informatics (PI) technique to obtain the seismic hazard in 

the  Kobe  and  Tokyo  regions  of  Japan.    First,  we  introduced  the  PI  method.    Next  we 

briefly described the JMA catalog with the locations, magnitudes, and times of earthquakes 

in and around Japan.    Earthquakes of magnitude equal to or larger than mc = 3 with depths 

shallower than 20 km in the time period from 1955 to 2004 were selected.    We applied the 

method for optimal forecasting of large (m (cid:16096) 5) earthquakes in Kobe region during the time 

period Jan. 1, 1995 – Mar. 14, 2004 (t3 – t2 ~ 9 years).    This was best illustrated using a 

specific  example.    The  created  forecast  map  demonstrated  that  retrospective  forecast  is 

reasonably successful.    We noted that the 1995 Kobe and 2000 Tottori earthquakes fall in 

26 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

anomalous areas.    For comparison, the seismic intensity distribution (null hypothesis) was 

shown.    We  found  that  the  optimized  PI  method  narrows  the  possible  locations  of  the 

occurrence of large future earthquakes.    Statistical testing for the PI method forecast was 

carried out.    For a null hypothesis, the actual seismic intensity data were used.    We used 

maximum  likelihood  tests  with  the  probability  density  functions,  global  Gaussian  model 

and  local  Poissonian  model.    The  results  of  the  statistical  tests  showed  that  the 

log-likelihood  for  the  PI  forecast  was  larger  than  that  for  the  null  hypothesis.    We 

concluded  that  the  optimized  PI  method  has  better  forecast  skill  than  the  actual  seismic 

intensity data.    For further test of the forecasting algorithm, we make a future forecast to 

prove correct.    The PI method was applied for creating potential maps for large earthquake 

events with m (cid:16096) 5 for the forecast time period from Jan. 1, 2000 to Dec. 31, 2009 in the 

Kobe and Tokyo regions.    Several forecast areas on the Kobe map were pointed out: the 

epicentral  area  of  the  1995  Kobe  earthquake,  the  Wakayama  area,  the  Mie  area,  and  the 

Aichi  area.    The  Tokyo  forecast  map  was  obtained  prior  to  the  Oct.  23,  2004  Niigata 

earthquake  (m  =  6.8)  and  the  principal  aftershocks  with  5.0  (cid:148) m  occurred.    These 

27 (Nanjo et al., 2004)   

forecasting in Japan.     

earthquakes occurred in an anomalous area in the Tokyo hazard map.    This is an example 

that  the  PI  technique  has  considerable  promise  as  an  intermediate-term  earthquake

Table caption 

Table 1 

Shown are the study regions used for forecasting large earthquakes in the Kobe and Tokyo 

regions and the statistical results.    The regions are numbered.    0.1° corresponds roughly 

to 11 km.    The number of 0.1°  (cid:117)   0.1°  (cid:117)   20 km boxes is given in the column “N”.    The 

log-likelihoods computed using the global Gaussian model and local Poissonian model for 

the  PI  method  forecast  are  given  in  the  columns  log10  (LG)  and  log10  (LP),  respectively.   

Similarly,  the  log-likelihoods  computed  using  the  global  Gaussian  model  and  local 

Poissonian model for the seismic intensity data (null hypothesis) are given in the columns 

log10 (LGN) and log10 (LPN), respectively.

Oscillation Conditions of the Vircator Klystron 
with External Delayed Feedback: A Computer Simulation
V. G. Anfinogentov and A. E. Hramov

 

Abstract
—A new version of the virtual-cathode oscillator, vircator klystron, is suggested and studied numeri-
cally. It essentially includes adjustable external feedback. The non-steady-state nonlinear dynamics of the oscil-
lator is analyzed in relation to the beam current and feedback parameters. Physical processes in the electron
stream during transitions between oscillation conditions are considered.

INTRODUCTION

High-power microwave generation by virtual-cathode
(VC) oscillators, called vircators, has been under active
experimental and numerical investigation (see [1–3] and
references therein). Special attention is payed to the VC
devices that include different types of external or inter-
nal  feedback  [4–7].  Vircators  with  external  delayed
feedback are referred to as virthodes [4, 5]. They allow
one to increase the efﬁciency and to control the spec-
trum and power of the output signal. The latter can be
done by adjusting feedback parameters, e.g., the delay
[4, 8, 9]. Also promising are internal-feedback vircators
with an input resonator, called vircator klystrons [10, 11].
They could offer high efﬁciency and an almost sinuso-
idal output waveform.

This  paper  considers  a  vircator  klystron  provided
with 
  delayed  feedback,  the  input  resonator
being tuned to the VC frequency. Thus, the oscillator
has two feedback loops with differing delays. Besides
, a feedback is effected by
d
the external loop with delay 
the reﬂection of the electron stream from the VC to the
input resonator. Both delays are less than 
, the char-
acteristic  period  of  VC  oscillations.  The  presence  of
two  feedback  loops  enables  one  to  selectively  control
structures  that  are  formed  in  the  electron  stream  and
determine the dynamics of the VC (see, e.g., [12–16]).

We  take  a  numerical  approach  whereby  electron
motion equations and Maxwell’s equations are solved
in a self-consistent manner. On this basis, we explore
the  oscillation  conditions  of  the  device  and  physical
processes in the electron stream.

FORMULATION  OF  THE  PROBLEM

Let us consider the following model of the vircator
klystron with external delayed feedback. The oscillator
contains  a  working  chamber  formed  by  a  cylindrical
waveguide  of  length 
.  The  waveguide
consists  of  a  hollow  and  a  coaxial  section  extending
, respectively.

,  and  energy  560  keV  be  injected

b
into  the  working  chamber  through  a  narrow  coaxial
input  resonator.  The  beam  current  is  assumed  to  be
above the space-charge-limited current for the conﬁgu-
ration at hand, so that a VC is formed in the beam. Elec-
trons reﬂected from the VC travel through the resonator
to be collected by an input grid. Accordingly, they are
not involved in the stream oscillation occurring in the
cathode–VC  space.  (We  follow  the  so-called  reditron
model described in [17].) The resonance frequency of
the  input  resonator  is  selected  so  that  it  is  approxi-
mately  equal  to  that  of  the VC;  it  is  on  the  order  of
8 GHz. The  signal  from  the  output  part  of  the  device
comes to an input modulator via an external feedback
circuit with delay 
d

.

A strong magnetic ﬁeld is applied along the system
axis, so that the electron motion can be considered one-
dimensional. For a given 
, the cross section of the elec-
z
tron  stream  is  viewed  as  a  set  of  concentric  charged
annuli in order to allow for the nonuniformity of cur-
rent-density distribution over the waveguide cross sec-
tion.  This  technique  is  frequently  used  when  dealing
with klystron oscillators or ampliﬁers (see [18] and ref-
th annulus obeys

with the spectrum having a prominent principal compo-

power spectrum typical of this regime, for 
 = 6.3 kA
and 
  =  1. There  are  two  base  frequencies,  whose
0
ratio  is  an  irrational  number.  The  prominent  spectral
component is located at one of them. The power gener-
ated at the second base frequency is lower by more than
20  dB.  The  remaining  components  are  harmonic  and
combination frequencies. The spectrum includes a rip-
pled  noise  background,  which  rapidly  decreases  with
increasing frequency. Its magnitude is about 40 dB at
10 GHz.

power  at  the  second  base  frequency  is  somewhat
higher,  –15  dB. The  level  of  the  noise  background  is
higher as well.

tions.  The  spectrum  now  exhibits  two  almost  equal

PHYSICAL  PROCESSES
IN  THE  ELECTRON  STREAM

Let  us  analyze  the  physical  processes  that  attend
transitions between oscillation conditions as the exter-
nal-feedback delay d is varied. Our conclusions will be
based on trajectory plots in the t–z-plane and the distri-
butions of reﬂected electrons in the lifetime in the inter-
action  space,  F(t ),  the  electrons  being  reﬂected  from
the VC back to the injection plane. The trajectory plots
will refer to different layers of the stream, and the dis-
tributions, to different operating conditions.

Figure 3 shows trajectory plots of charged particles
for three layers differing in radius. The motion is com-
puted for one oscillation period. Figure 3a is drawn for
the  innermost  layer.  It  illustrates  how  a VC  typically
develops in a vircator. It is seen that secondary struc-
tures formed in the transit stream decelerate in the time-
dependent ﬁeld of a developing VC (see, e.g., [13, 14]).
The  charged  particles  cluster  into  electron  bunches,
which  partly  reﬂect  the  stream  back  to  the  injection
plane.  (In  the  trajectory  plot,  the  bunches  are  repre-
sented  by  the  areas  where  electron  trajectories  con-
verge.) The reﬂected portion of the stream disturbs the
development of the VC in subsequent oscillation peri-
ods,  thus  complicating  system  dynamics  [13–16].  In
the middle layer (Fig. 3b), the formation of a VC and
related phenomena are less noticeable. In the outermost
layer (Fig. 3c), a VC exists for a short time and so do
reﬂected particles; consequently, no kinematic instabil-

ity is revealed in the zero-Coulomb-repulsion approxi-
mation. Also note that respective VCs come into being
at different instants, starting with the innermost layer,
as  indicated  by  reﬂected  electrons.  Accordingly,  the
lifetime of the blocking potential barrier is maximal in
the innermost layer and minimal in the outermost one.
The beam thus develops a space-charge oscillation in
the transverse direction.

The  interaction  between  structures  in  the  layers
leads to the onset of chaos in VC dynamics, so that the
operation band widens. Furthermore, the formation of
additional structures is strongly inﬂuenced by the feed-
back signal, as evidenced by the fact that the oscillation
becomes  more  complicated  if  d/T0  »
  0.3–0.5.  This  is
due  to  a  nonzero  phase  angle  that  arises  between  the
feedback signal and the ﬁeld oscillation in the input res-
onator,  the  latter  governing  the  premodulation  of  the
stream.

To  ﬁnd  out  why  the  second  independent  base  fre-
quency appears in the spectrum, we examined the dis-
tributions  of  charged  particles  in  their  lifetime  in  the
drift space, F(t ). Figures 4a and 4b show graphs of F(t )
for region A, at I = 6.9 kA and d/T0 = 1, and region C,
at I = 6.9 kA and d/T0 = 0.25, respectively. They refer
to the middle layer.

Let us consider the case where lifetime t  is not very
long. For region A, the distribution has only one peak
(see the left side of Fig. 4a). This indicates that there is
a single spatial structure, namely, a VC, with a principal
spectral component representing the oscillation of the
VC as a whole.

 0.5Æ Te

By contrast, there are two peaks in the distribution
corresponding to region C (see the left side of Fig. 4b).
One of them is located in the same place as the above-
mentioned  peak,  whereas  the  other  (a  highly  blurred
one) is typical of this regime only. It follows that two
electron  structures  reﬂecting  charged  particles  are
formed in the electron stream (see, e.g., [5, 15]). The
respective  characteristic  lifetimes  of  particles  in  the
structures are in the same ratio as the base frequencies.
Since d/T0 = 0.25, we have d »
æ  is the
average  transit  time  of  an  electron  reﬂected  from  the
VC. Accordingly, the velocity modulation of the stream
is maximal at the instants when a VC is created in the
stream  and  when  the  space-charge  density r
  near  the
injection plane is minimal. In this case, more structures
are  formed  as  a  result  of  both  the  modulation  of  the
stream by a strong feedback signal and zero-Coulomb-
repulsion  bunching.  The  space  charge  cannot  impede
the growth of the structures to an appreciable degree,
because r
 is small. The charges of the electron struc-
tures (dense bunches) are large enough to partly reﬂect
the electron stream (see, e.g., [13–16]). This promotes
instability in the stream, so that the oscillation becomes
strongly chaotic, which we observe in region C.

When d/T0 ~ 1 (Fig. 4a), we can see a low local peak
at  sufﬁciently  large  t   as  well  as  the  principal  one
located in the region of small lifetimes. The lifetime at

which this low peak is located is important in that the
dynamics of corresponding particles is responsible for
the generation of the second (low) base frequency in the
power spectrum. This time scale of the stream dynam-
ics cannot be noticed with ease in the distributions or
power spectra. Nevertheless, as d is decreased, second-
ary  structures  exert  more  and  more  inﬂuence  on  the
stream  dynamics,  so  that  the  magnitude  of  the  corre-
sponding spectral component increases concurrently.

CONCLUSIONS

We  have  simulated  the  operation  of  a  vircator
klystron  provided  with  an  external  feedback.  It  was
found that the oscillator allows one to efﬁciently handle
the formation of structures in the electron stream. If the
input resonator is tuned to the natural frequency of the
VC, three oscillation conditions are possible, depend-
ing on the feedback delay: (1) almost sinusoidal oscil-
lation,  (2)  weak  quasi-periodicity  with  two  base  fre-
quencies (one of which is dominant), and (3) chaos in
the  form  of  fully  developed  two-periodic  oscillation
with  two  incommensurable  frequencies. The  onset  of
chaos  is  related  to  the  formation  of  secondary  struc-
tures in the electron stream as a result of its modulation,
with the feedback delay being sufﬁciently large.

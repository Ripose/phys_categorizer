A custom, flat field, extreme ultraviolet EUV spectrometer built specifically for use with

low power light sources that operate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions is reported. The

spectral range of the spectrometer extends from 4 nm to 40 nm. The instrument optimizes

the light gathering power and signal to noise ratio while achieving good resolution. A

detailed description of the spectrometer and design considerations are presented, as well

as a novel procedure that could be used to obtain a synthetic wavelength calibration with

the aid of only a single known spectral feature. This synthetic wavelength calibration is

compared to a standard wavelength calibration obtained from previously reported spectral

lines of Xe, Ar and Ne ions recorded with this spectrometer.

I. INTRODUCTION

Interest in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) ion spectroscopy has increased in the last few years

[1-15] due in part to the need of the EUV lithography community to accurately model

commercial  EUV  light  sources.  EUV  lithography  (EUVL)  is  targeted  by  the

semiconductor industry to be used as the “next generation” technology that will deliver

feature  sizes  projected  by  Moore’s  Law.  However,  many  critical  issues  need  to  be

addressed  before  successful  deployment  can  be  realized.   Among  these  is  the

development of powerful EUV sources that can deliver over 100 Watts in-band (+/- ≈

0.27 nm) at 13.5 nm. In order to meet the industrial power requirement, accurate plasma

models  are  used  in  support  of  the  engineering  process,  which  in  turn  require  reliable

fundamental  EUV  atomic  data.   As  part  of  the  effort  to  deliver  the  fundamental  data

needed  and  to  provide  benchmark  test  spectra,  a  custom  flat-field  EUV  spectrometer

optimized  for  use  with  the  National  Institute  of  Standards  and  Technology  (NIST)

Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT) has been built for EUV spectroscopy in the 4 nm to 40

nm wavelength range. While the instrument has been optimized for use with the NIST

EBIT, the design is expected to provide good performance when used with almost any

EUV source.

The NIST EBIT is a versatile light source, capable of producing nearly any ion charge

state. The narrow electron beam energy spread allows a precise control of the charge state

distribution  present  in  the  trap,  and  of  the  excitation  of  the  trapped  ions.  A  detailed

description of the NIST EBIT may be found elsewhere [16-17].  One of the challenges of

using the EBIT to support EUVL data needs is the EBIT’s weak emission of EUV light

2

(10-10  W),  compared  with  the  EUVL  sources  that  currently  produce  tens  of  watts.

Therefore, ultra low noise and high light gathering capability were primary goals in the

design of the EUV spectrometer, while also maintaining good resolution (±0.02 nm).

In designing an instrument to meet these objectives, a number of schemes for coupling

the EBIT light source into the spectrometer have been extensively modeled.  In section II

of  this  paper,  a  detailed  description  of  the  EUV  spectrometer  is  presented.  This  is

followed by the calculation of the spectrometer detection efficiency in section III. The

considerations in the design of this instrument are presented in section IV, in particular,

the use of a spherical focusing mirror for efficient light gathering. Section V describes a

synthetic  calibration  method  based  on  ray-tracing  calculations  and  a  single  known

spectral line. Section VI presents a standard wavelength calibration based on recorded

spectra of Ne, Ar and Xe ions that is compared in section VII to the synthetic calibration.

II. APPARATUS

The  EUV  spectrometer  is  pictured  in  Figure  1  along  with  a  mechanical  schematic.

Starting from the source end (top of figure), it consists of a zirconium vacuum window, a

spherical focusing mirror, a set of bilateral continuously adjustable slits, a gold-coated-

concave reflection grating, and a detector. The center of the spherical mirror is 48 cm

away  from  the  EBIT  axis,  at  a  grazing  incidence  angle  of  3°.  The  spherical  mirror

reflecting surface is coated with gold and has a radius of curvature of 917.1 cm ± 2.3 cm.

The physical dimensions of the mirror are 4 cm high by 10 cm long. The function of this

mirror  is  to  collect  light  from  the  EBIT  source  and  concentrate  it  onto  the  bilateral,

3

continuously adjustable slits, located 48 cm from the center of this mirror. The reflection

grating follows the 1200 lines/mm design reported by Harada and Kita [18] and has been

further characterized by several researchers [19,20]. The grating has a radius of curvature

of 564.9 cm ± 2.0 cm, variable groove spacing (a flat field grating) and is 3 cm high by 5

cm  long.  This  grating  has  been  implemented  in  other  similar  EUV  spectrometers

[2,15,21,22]. In the NIST spectrometer, the grating is located 23.7 cm from the slits and

is placed at a grazing incidence angle of 3°. A mask is placed in front of the grating that

reduces the amount of scattered light impinging on the grating.  The detector is a liquid

nitrogen cooled, back illuminated charge coupled device (CCD) camera that is placed in

the focal plane of the reflection grating, located 23.5 cm away from the grating center.

The dimensions between the slits, grating, and detector are the same as those used by

Kita et al. [23], yielding a reciprocal linear dispersion of the grating that varies from 4.24

nm/cm at 5 nm to 7.55 nm/cm at 20 nm in the first negative diffractive order. The CCD

array consists of 1340 x 400 pixels (each pixel is 20 µm x 20 µm) and is directly exposed

to the EUV radiation. It is mounted on a two dimensional linear stage. One dimension

allows the surface of the CCD array to be positioned in the focal plane of the grating, by

adjusting the distance from the grating, while the other dimension is used to select the

wavelength  range.  The  angular  position  of  the  CCD  plane  is  fixed  with  respect  to

the vacuum chamber and the diffraction grating is adjusted (with a retro-reflecting laser

beam) such that the focal plane is parallel to the CCD face within 3 arc minutes.  Ultra-

high vacuum is maintained by two 100 L/s ion pumps connected to the mirror chamber

and the grating chamber. The pressure in each chamber is in the 10-7 Pa range during data

acquisition, as measured by cold cathode gauges. Cooling the CCD camera with liquid

4

nitrogen also helps reduce the gas load in the grating chamber. Neither UHV chamber

was baked after the installation of fragile optics. A 0.1 µm thick zirconium foil, supported

by a 70 lines/mm nickel mesh with 87 % open area, is mounted in a valve on the optical

axis between the EBIT light source and the focusing mirror. This foil serves as a filter to

block  visible  light,  and  also  provides  the  option  of  isolating  the  vacuum  of  the  EBIT

(typically ≈10-8 Pa) from that of the spectrometer. The Zr filter efficiently transmits EUV

radiation  in  the  band  between  5  nm  and  25  nm  (discussed  further  in  the  next  section)

[24].

III. SPECTROMETER DETECTION EFFICIENCY AND RESOLVING POWER.

The  detection  efficiency  of  the  spectrometer  is  defined  as  the  ratio  of  the  number  of

photons  detected  by  the  CCD  array  to  the  number  of  photons  entering  the  mirror’s

numerical aperture.   The detection efficiency was calculated in negative first diffractive

order using the ray tracing code SHADOW [25]. In this calculation, the dimensions listed

in  Table  I  and  the  efficiency  of  each  component  were  included,  except  the  quantum

efficiency  of  the  CCD  array  and  the  transmission  of  the  Zr-filter,  which  were

incorporated separately. The detection efficiency as a function of wavelength is shown in

Figure 2, as determined by launching rays uniformly over the range of source positions

and angles that accurately model the EBIT with a 300 µm slit width; the dashed line in

Figure 2 shows the effect of the Zr filter on the detection efficiency.  While the relative

efficiency as calculated by SHADOW is expected to be representative of the instrument,

SHADOW  overestimated  the  absolute  efficiency  of  the  grating  (SHADOW  predicts

about  80%)  when  compared  with  experimental  measurements,  which  report  absolute

5

efficiencies of about 10% in this wavelength range [26,27].  The second most significant

factor  in  the  instrument’s  detection  efficiency  is  the  quantum  efficiency  of  the  CCD

camera, which varies between 40 % and 50 % in the 4 nm to 40 nm range.  A resolving

power (λ/Δλ, where λ is the wavelength and Δλ the resolution) of 577 for 50 µm slit size

was obtained by measuring the 4d10 1S0-4d94f 1P1 Xe IX line profile. For slit sizes larger

than 300 µm the resolving power remains at a constant value of 350.

IV. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

In order to maximize the light gathering power of the spectrometer, many systems were

studied and simulated using the ray-tracing code SHADOW [25] through the SHADOW

Visual  User  Interface  [28]  (both  programs  are  freely  available).  Calculations  of  the

reflectivity of gold-coated mirrors at 4 nm show a drop with increasing angle to near zero

at a grazing incidence angle of about 10 degrees [24]. This limits the selection of light

gathering  systems  to  those  at  grazing  incidence  angles  of  <  10º.  The  throughput  was

maximized by optimizing the intensity of the light reaching the simulated CCD array. For

each of the light collection systems considered, the distance between the EBIT source and

the (first) mirror was kept fixed (to the smallest possible distance), while many possible

incidence angles and mirror radii of curvature were tried.

Among the systems considered was the Kirkpatrick-Baez two-spherical-mirror scheme

[29] previously employed in a flat field spectrometer [22] used for laser produced plasma

studies. In the case of a weak light source (e.g., EBIT source), this system presents the

disadvantage of having intrinsic loss of light collection due to the small solid angle of the

6

first mirror as seen from the second mirror. Other systems based on a single mirror of

various  geometries  were  also  considered,  such  as  toroidal,  ellipsoidal,  and  elliptical

cylinder  geometries.  The  toroidal  mirror  has  very  poor  sagittal  focusing  unless  the

smaller  of  the  two  radii  of  curvature  is  made  very  small  compared  to  the  distance

between  source  and  mirror.  In  this  limit,  substantial  aberrations  are  introduced.  The

ellipsoidal and the elliptical cylinder mirror would result in very efficient light collection

systems if the mirror is placed at about 10 cm from the EBIT axis. However, this would

require  positioning  the  mirror  in  a  high-voltage  environment  representing  substantial

practical difficulties.

The optimal light gathering system was found to be a single spherical mirror placed at 48

cm from the EBIT axis at a grazing incidence angle of 3º. This configuration maximizes

the solid angle as seen from the EBIT while ensuring high reflectivity and preventing

overfilling of the grating. This system concentrates the light emitted from the EBIT onto

the slits, although the design also works well for a wide variety of other types of sources.

In all these simulations the source dimensions were 2.5 cm x 300 µm x 300 µm, which

are typical of the EBIT’s plasma dimensions.

V. SYNTHETIC CALIBRATION

For many applications other than the EBIT, easy identification of spectral markers is not

possible due to the abundance (or scarcity for synchrotron sources) of spectral features.

7

The  calibration  procedure  presented  here  provides  a  method  for  determining  spectral

positions accurately from a single known spectral line.

The complete system is modeled in SHADOW for each spectral feature by launching tens

of  thousands  of  rays  at  a  distribution  of  starting  positions  and  angles  mimicking  the

geometry  of  the  source.   The  rays  are  distributed  in  the  simulated  exit  plane  of  the

spectrometer  over  a  width  that  depends  on  the  slit  width.   The  center  position  of  the

distribution is selected by binning the exit plane positions and assigning the position of

the  maximum  bin  xi  to  correspond  to  the  input  wavelength λi.   Spectral  lines  were

simulated from 4 nm to 40 nm in 1 nm increments to form a set of points (xi ,λi), which

are plotted as solid dots in Figure 3.   The x=0 position is at the intersection of the line

that runs from the center of the grating perpendicular to the focal plane, shown in Figure

4. The dimensions and critical quantities for accurate modeling of the spectrometer using

SHADOW are included in Table I. Since a simple, theoretical dispersion function for the

flat-field grating is not known, a fourth order polynomial expansion was used to fit the set

of points (xi,λi):

where λsyn is the wavelength in nm, x is the distance along the grating focal plane in cm

and a0 = -1.179 nm, a1 = 0.01753 nm/cm, a2 = 0.7605 nm/cm2, a3 = -0.00317 nm/cm3, a4

= -0.00064 nm/cm4 are the coefficients for the function plotted as a solid line in Figure 3.

8

The location of the CCD on the focal plane is found by recording the pixel number pk of

one known spectral line λk as shown in Figure 4. The corresponding position xk of this

pixel is found by use of SHADOW. In our case, the CCD camera used has a pixel size of

20 µm, i.e. 500 pixels/cm. Thus, the position in centimeters x0 of the first pixel is x0=xk-

pk/500. The position of each pixel x(p) on the focal plane is

       (3)

As an example of the above procedure, a synthetic calibration was obtained for the EUV

spectrometer by using the 4d10 1S0-4d94f 1P1 transition of Xe IX as the known line.  This

line has been reported by Churilov and Joshi [30] at λk = 12.0133 nm ± 0.003 nm. This

transition is the most intense line observed with the EBIT in the 4 nm to 20 nm spectral

range. Then, the corresponding pk was found by a peak fitting procedure to be at 773.7

pixels and the calculated position xk at 4.223 cm.

VI.  STANDARD CALIBRATION

9

Spectra of Xe, Ar and Ne trapped ions at the EBIT were recorded in the 4 nm to 20 nm

range  at  8  keV  electron  beam  energy.  These  measurements  are  shown  in  Figures  5-7.

The numbers on the figures correspond to 35 previously reported lines listed in Table II

and  used  to  perform  a  standard  calibration.  For  this  calibration,  each  spectral  feature

indicated in Figures 5-7 was fitted with a Voigt function to determine the pixel center

(non-integer  pixel  number).  These  values  were  plotted  versus  their  corresponding

reported  wavelengths  and  fitted  with  a  fourth  order  polynomial  to  obtain  the  standard

wavelength  calibration  (λstd).  The  coefficients  of  the  polynomial  are  b0=4.22371  nm,

b1=0.00799 nm, b2=2.7413x10-6 nm, b3=-7.42166x10-11 nm, and b4=-1.11772x10-14 nm.

The  columns  in  Table  II  are,  respectively,  the  feature  number,  identified  transition,

reported wavelengths (λrep), bibliography reference, pixel center, the wavelength obtained

from the synthetic calibration (λsyn) given by equation 3 and the last column contains the

standard calibration wavelengths (λstd).

All recorded spectra used for the wavelength calibration were acquired using the CCD

camera  operating  in  spectroscopy  mode.  In  this  mode,  the  CCD  array  of  1340  x  400

pixels (horizontal x vertical) is converted to a one-dimensional row of 1340 pixels by

hardware  binning  along  the  vertical  dimension  (sagittal)  using  the  manufacturer’s

acquisition software. The spectra recorded in this way has an improved signal to noise

ratio  (S/N)  for  a  given  integration  time  due  to  the  factor  of  400  reduction  in  readout

noise, compared to the spectra acquired with no binning and analyzed as a full 1340 x

400 array. The cosmic radiation background was removed by using multiple frames in

post-acquisition data processing. Prior to the wavelength calibration measurements, ion

10

spectral lines were acquired by the CCD array operating in imaging mode (no binning) to

establish that all recorded lines were as parallel as possible to the vertical 400-pixel rows

and did not exhibit any observable optical aberrations (e.g., curvature).

VII. DISCUSSION.

Shown in Figure 8 are the differences between the synthetic and standard wavelengths

from the reported values (λsyn-λrep  and λstd-λrep) for the 35 identified lines [30-39]. The

standard deviations of the differences are 0.011 nm and 0.008 nm respectively. The gray

region in Figure 8 represents the spectral width of a single pixel (+/- _ pixel) that varies

from 0.008 nm to 0.015 nm at 4 nm and 20 nm respectively. The error bars in the plot are

the uncertainties reported in the literature for each λrep and represent the uncertainty at

each point for both series, shown for just one series to reduce clutter in the plot.   The

reduced accuracy of the synthetic calibration is due in part to the difficulty of simulating

factors  such  as  fabrication  tolerances,  the  difficulty  in  positioning  the  CCD  in  the

theoretical  focal  plane  of  the  grating  and  the  final  alignment  of  the  optical  elements

(including  CCD  rotational  angle).    The  discrepancy  between  the  synthetic  and  the

standard calibration can be accounted for with a small linear correction to the synthetic

calibration.   The use of the synthetic calibration allows users to deploy the instrument

expediently  with  minimal  loss  of  accuracy.   For  maximum  precision  the  user  is

encouraged to perform a standard calibration.

In this paper, a flat field, UHV extreme ultraviolet spectrometer with good resolution and

optimized light collection has been presented along with a demonstration of performance.

Further, a novel technique for calibrating this (and potentially other spectrometers) based

11

on a single known spectral feature and ray tracing is presented.  Comparison with the

standard calibration procedure indicates a total uncertainty similar to the size of the CCD

pixel, probably due to the peak selection technique used in the synthetic calibration.

Figure 1. Photograph from EUV mirror (top) to CCD and schematic drawing (top view)

of the EUV spectrometer for the EBIT facility at NIST. All linear dimensions are given in

Figure 2. Detection efficiency calculated from SHADOW using a 300 µm x 3 cm EBIT

source and a 300 µm slit, with and without Zr-filter (detector efficiency included as a

multiplicative factor ≈0.42).  As implemented, SHADOW overestimated the absolute

efficiency of the grating, see main text for further discussion.

Figure 3. The solid dots are the positions of uniformly spaced monochromatic lines

calculated using SHADOW.  The solid line represents the fit function (Eq. 1) used to

establish the relation between the linear and the wavelength position.

Figure 4. Schematic diagram showing the position xk of a known wavelength λk  in the

grating focal plane (x-axis). The distance x0 of the first CCD pixel from the origin is

depicted.

Figure 5. EUV spectrum of Xe ions radiating from the EBIT operating at 8 keV with 147

mA of electron beam current, and entrance slits at 50 µm for 4 minutes.  Individual

numbered features are identified in Table II.

mA of electron beam current, and entrance slits at 50 µm for 12 minutes. Individual

numbered features are identified in Table II.

Figure 7. EUV spectrum of Ne ions radiating from the EBIT operating at 8 keV with 147

mA of electron beam current, and entrance slits at 50 µm for 12 minutes. Individual

numbered features are identified in Table II.

Figure 8.   Comparison of two wavelength calibration procedures  λsyn(p) and λstd(p)

using the reported values λrep listed in Table II. The shaded region represents the spectral

width of a pixel (+/- _ pixel).  Uncertainties shown are due only to the uncertainty in the

λrep.

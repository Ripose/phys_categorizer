Abstract  :  The  basic  theory  for  a  novel  scaled  boundary  finite  element  formulation  is 

developed  for  the  general  vector  finite  element  functional  in  H  formulation  governing  

waveguides  and  resonators  in  electromagnetics.  Also,  the  advantages  of  the  proposed 

scaled boundary finite element formulation is explained. 

 
Key words : Scaled Boundary finite element method, Vector Finite Element method 
 
Introduction  :  The  Finite  Element  method  has  proved  to  be  one  of  the  most  versatile 

technique  to  analyze  and  design  microwave  devices.  In  particular,  the  Vector  Finite 

element  method  has  been  successfully  applied  for  the  analysis  of  complex  three 

dimensional geometries  occurring  in electromagnetics. However, when the vector finite 

element method is applied to the three dimensional geometries, in general, it necessitates 

discretization  in  all  the  three  dimensions.  This  in  turn  requires  huge  memory 

requirements for storing  element datas like node numbers, local and global coordinates 

of elements, and connectivity data between elements in all the three dimensions. Also the 

discretization  in  three  dimensions  significantly  increases  the  computation  time  for  the 

eigen  value  and  eigen  vector  computation  of  the  resulting  finite  element  equation. 

matrices can be exploited to simplify the eigen value and eigen vector computation.

 In  this  paper,  a  novel  scaled  boundary  finite  element  approach  ,  which  was  initially 

developed by Chongmin Song and  John.P.Wolf [1-13] to successfully solve elastodynamic 

and  allied  problems  in  civil  engineering  ,  is  reformulated  for  the  general  functional 

governing cavities and waveguides in electromagnetics.  

      The  scaled  boundary  finite  element  method  is  based  entirely  on  finite  elements  but 

with  a  discretization  only  on  the  boundary.  Unlike  the  boundary  element  method,  this 

method  doesn’t  require  any  fundamental  solution  (Green’s  function)  to  be  known  in 

advance.  In  order  to  apply  this  novel  method,  a  scaling  center  is  first  chosen  in  such  a 

way that the total boundary under consideration is visible from it. In case of geometries 

where it is not possible to find such a scaling center, the entire geometry is sub-structured 

[13] , and in each sub structure the scaling center can be chosen and the scaled boundary 

finite  element  method  can  be  applied  to  each  sub  structure  independently  and  can  be 

combined together so that in effect, the whole geometry is analyzed. The concept of the 

scaled boundary finite element is described in detail in [1] but is repeated here in brief for 

convenience. By scaling the boundary in the radial direction with respect to the scaling 

center O with a scaling factor smaller than 1, the whole domain is covered.  

 
This is shown in Fig.(1).

The scaling applies to each surface finite element. Its discretized surface on the boundary 

is  denoted  as  Se  (superscript  e  for  element).  Continuous  scaling  of  the  element  yields  a 

pyramid with volume Ve. The scaling center O is at its apex. The base of the pyramid is 

the surface finite element. The sides of the pyramid forming the boundary Ae follow from 

connecting the curved edge of the surface finite element to the scaling center by straight 

lines.  No  discretization  on  Ae  occurs.  Assembling  all  the  pyramids  by  connecting  their 

sides  which  corresponds  to  enforcing  compatibility  and  equilibrium  results  in  the  total 

medium  with  volume  V  and  the  closed  boundary  S.  No  boundaries  Ae  passing  through 

the scaling center remain. Mathematically, the scaling corresponds to a transformation of 

the coordinates for each finite element, resulting in the two curvilinear local coordinates 

in  the  circumferential  directions  on  the  surface  and  the  dimensionless  radial  coordinate 

representing  the  scaling  factor.  This  transformation  is  unique  due  to  the  choice  of  the 

scaling  center  from  which  the  total  boundary  of  the  geometry  is  visible.  Summarizing, 

scaling  of  the  boundary  discretized  with  finite  elements  is  applied,  which  explains  the 

name  of  the  scaled  boundary  finite-element  method.  The  advantages  of  the  scaled 

boundary finite element method are as follows : 

 
a)  Reduction of the spatial dimension by one, reducing the discretization effort and the 

number of degrees of freedom. 

b)  No  fundamental  solution  required  which  permits  general  anisotropic  material  to  be 

addressed and eliminates singular integrals. 

c)  Radiation condition at infinity satisfied exactly for unbounded media. 

d)  No  discretization  on  that  part  of  the  boundary  and  interfaces  between  different 

materials passing through the scaling center. 

e)  Analytical expression for the field variables in the radial direction. 

f)  Converges  to  the  exact  solution  in  the  finite-element  sense  in  the  circumferential 

directions. 

      automatically satisfied. 

g)  Tangential Continuity conditions at the interfaces of different elements are

The  transformation  of  the  geometry  corresponding  to  the  scaled  boundary  in  Fig.1  is 

addressed. In Fig.2., given above,  a specific finite element is addressed . The coordinates

described by its position vector

the geometry of the boundary is so general that only a piecewise description is feasible. 

(Doubly-curved) surface finite elements are used. 

     A  specific  finite  element  is  addressed.  The  geometry  of  this  finite  element  on  the 

boundary is represented by interpolating its nodal coordinates {x},{y},{z} using the local 

coordinates η,ζ. 

x(η,ζ)=[N(η,ζ)] {x}                                                                                      (3a)

It  is  shown  in  [14]  that  for  two  dimensional  surface  finite  elements  employing  the 

functions  of  the  form  given  above,  the  condition  m<n  is  necessary  in  the  double 

summation series expansion and only the tangential continuity between adjacent elements 

need  to  be  imposed  in  order  to  avoid  spurious  modes,  the  spurious  modes  being  the 

modes giving  non zero divergence to H. The functions f1(ξ),f2(η),f3(ς) are represented in

where N=((m+1)(n+1) ) –1 and ak , bk, ck are arbitrary unknown coefficients. 
 
Since ak , bk, ck are arbitrary , they can be replaced by hξ (i,j) , hη(i,j) , hς(i,j) respectively in 

the  same  sequence  as  the  h(i,j)  coefficients  appear  in  the  double  summation  series.  The 

number  of  unknown  coefficients  in  the  double  summation  series  for  every  single 

component  of  H  is  chosen  to  be  equal  to  the  number  of  unknown  coefficients  in  the 

corresponding radial expansion. This results in the expression of N in terms of m and n 

given above. The effect of this replacement makes the radial expansion also in terms of 

the  unknown  h(i,j)  coefficients.  This  has  the  advantage  that  the  resulting  finite  element 

equation contains only a single type of unknown h(i,j) coefficients which can be solved for 

numerically.  It  is  shown  in  [15]  that  the  imposition  of  the  condition  divH=0  (µr=1)  is 

equivalent to the following set of constraint equations on the unknown h(i,j) coefficients.

In all the above expressions(21a-21f), h’ denotes the derivative of h with respect to the 

variable in the curved bracket. The subscripts denote the respective component terms of 

H(ξ,η,ς).  The  upper  and  lower  limits  of    η  and  ς  corresponds  to  their  limits  for  every 

individual  surface  finite  element.  The  constraint  equations  (20  a,b)  generate  a  total  of 

N+1 constraints for every surface finite element. These constraints are to be necessarily 

imposed so that the spurious modes are eliminated . The scaled boundary finite element 

equation is formulated as follows. The expressions for H in terms of its components in 

(ξ,η,ς) can be concisely written as 

Hξ= f1(ξ)g1(η,ς)                                                                                              (22a) 

Hη= f2(ξ)g2(η,ς)                                                                                              (22b) 

Hς= f3(ξ)g3(η,ς)                                                                                               (22c) 

Rewriting (16) using (7) and (22)  for  µr=1 we get  for a single surface element,

The  derivative  terms  in  the  above  integrals  can  be  evaluated  from  (17)  and  (22).  The 

other  terms  not  involving  the  derivatives  can  be  evaluated  using  (17).  In  the  equation 

(23), the integration with respect to ξ from 0 to 1 can be performed independent of  η and 

ς variables by treating them as constants with respect to ξ. The integrand of the collected 

terms of  ξ is a polynomial in ξ with the h coefficients being the unknown constants. The 

net  effect  of  the  integration  with  respect  to  ξ  gives  an  equation  similar  to  (23)  but 

involving  only  the  surface  integrals  containing  the  products  of  h  coefficients  coupled 

with some numerical constants. Then the constraint equations (20 a , 20 b) are imposed. 

This  is  done  by  elimination  of  common  h  coefficients  from  (20)  and  substituting  the 

resultant  in  the  equation  containing  only  the  surface  integrals  got  after  integrating  with 

respect to ξ. 

The net resultant equation obtained after the above procedure written in terms of a matrix 

equation  after  assembling  together  the  individual  finite  element  matrices  by  imposing 

only  tangential  continuity  between  adjacent  elements  on  the  boundary  for  every 

surface finite element is of the form[14] 

 

 

                                Ah+k0
where  h  is  the  vector  containing  the  unknown  coefficients.  The  above  eigen  value 

2Bh=0                                                  (25) 

equation can be can be solved by using standard numerical procedures. It is important 

to  note  that  equation  (25)  contains  terms  involving  only  the  surface  integrals  even 

for  the  general  3-D  case  instead  of  the  volume  integrals,  unlike  the  conventional 

finite  element  eigen  value  equation  involving  3-D  structures.  This  is  the  crucial 

advantage of the novel scaled boundary finite element method. 

Conclusion  :  A  novel  scaled  boundary  finite  element  formulation  is  introduced  for  the 

general  electromagnetic  functional  governing  wave  guides  and  resonators.  This  method 

contains reduced set of unknowns as compared to conventional finite element equations. 

Also  the  discretization  involved  in  this  new  formulation  is  only  on  the  surface  of  the 

geometry for three dimensional case which is an enormous benefit in terms of  resources 

and time for the eigen value and eigen vector  computation for complex geometries.

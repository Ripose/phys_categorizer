Abstract

A family of geometric models of quantum relativistic rotating os-
cillator is deﬁned by using a set of one-parameter deformations of the
static (3+1) de Sitter or anti-de Sitter metrics. It is shown that all
these models lead to the usual isotropic harmonic oscillator in the
non-relativistic limit, even though their relativistic behavior is dif-
ferent. As in the case of the (1+1) models [1], these will have even
countable energy spectra or mixed ones, with a ﬁnite discrete sequence
and a continuous part. In addition, all these spectra, except that of
the pure anti-de Sitter model, will have a ﬁne-structure, given by a
rotator-like term.

In the general relativity the relativistic (three-dimensional isotropic) har-
monic oscillator (RHO) is deﬁned as a free system on the anti-de Sitter static
background [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. There exists a metric [3] which reproduces the clas-
sical equation of motion of the non-relativistic (isotropic) harmonic oscillator
(NRHO). Moreover, the corresponding quantum system represented by a free
scalar ﬁeld on this background has an equidistant energy spectrum with a
ground state energy larger than, but approaching 3ω/2 in the non-relativistic
limit (in natural units, ¯h = c = 1) [7]. Thus, the static anti-de Sitter classical
and quantum geometric models reproduce all the properties of the NRHO

giving as unique relativistic eﬀect the value of the ground state energy of the
quantum RHO. For this reason it is interesting to look for new geometric
models which should behave as the NRHO in the non-relativistic limit but
having strong speciﬁc relativistic eﬀects.
In a previous article [1] we have
shown that such models can be constructed in (1+1) dimensions by using
appropriate one-parameter conformal transformations of the anti-de Sitter
or de Sitter static metrics. Thus, we have found a set of (1+1) models with
countable energy spectra, and another one having only a ﬁnite number of en-
ergy levels and a continuous spectrum. It remains us to see if these properties
could be recovered also in the case of the (3+1) models.

This article is devoted to this problem. In (3+1) dimensions the conformal
transformations will not suﬃce to give natural generalizations of our (1+1)
metrics [1]. Therefore, we are forced to use suitable deformations of the de
Sitter or anti-de Sitter metrics. Let us start with the anti-de Sitter static
metric proposed in Ref. [3]

This family contains deformed de Sitter metrics for λ > 0, deformed anti-de
Sitter metrics for λ < 0 and a deformed Minkowski metric corresponding to
λ = 0. The exact anti-de Sitter metric (1) can also be obtained for λ =
1.
The deformed anti-de Sitter metrics are singular for r = r0 = 1/ω√
λ which
is just the radius of the event horizon for an observer situated at xi = 0. In
the case of non-negative λ this is r0 =
. In the following, we shall consider
the free motion on the domain D of the space coordinates bounded by the
[0, r0). Here the equations of the classical free motion
event horizon, i.e. r
given by these metrics will be similar to that of the NRHO up to a Coriolis-
like term (linear in ˙xi) which will contribute for all λ
1. This produces

a speciﬁc rotation which dissapears in the non-relativistic limit. For this
reason, all the systems with λ
1 will be referred as relativistic rotating
oscillators (RRO), understanding that the RHO is only that of the anti-
de Sitter metric. We note that all these metrics are invariant under time
translations and space rotations. Consequently, the energy and the angular
momentum are conserved.

Our aim is to investigate the properties of the quantum free motions of
a spinless particle of mass M on the backgrounds given by (2) and to show
that all these models lead to the quantum NRHO in the non-relativistic limit.
Let us consider the scalar ﬁeld φ, deﬁned on D, minimally coupled with the
gravitational ﬁeld [8]. Because of the energy conservation, the Klein-Gordon

where F is the conﬂuent hypergeometric function and nr = 0, 1, 2, ... is the
radial quantum number. Now, by introducing the main quantum number,
n = 2nr + l, we see that the energy levels

which appears in a rotator-like term. It is obvious that l will take the even
values from 0 to n if n is even and the odd values from 1 to n for each odd n.
Thus, the energies remain degenerated only upon the quantum number m.
We note that the rotator-like term is of the order 1/c2 and, consequently, this
will not contribute in the non-relativistic limit, when ω/M
0. Moreover,
one can verify that, in this limit, the spectrum given by (13) becomes just
the NRHO traditional one.

These are depending on n and l with the same selection rules as mentioned
above in the case of λ = 0. Herein we see that the rotator-like term of (22),

vanishing only for the anti-de Sitter RHO. Now, it remains to ﬁx the suitable

Let us ﬁrst take λ > 0. In this case r0 =

square integrable only if p = p− and n <
2p−. This means that the discrete

We note that the number of the discrete levels is strongly dependent upon
the value of M/λω. For example, in the ultra-relativistic domain λω > M/2

the continuous energy spectrum. According to (24) this is [M

What is interesting here is that, for the values of the parameters giving
nmax > 0, the highest levels of the discrete spectrum will overlap the contin-
uous spectrum. In these conditions spontaneous transitions from the discrete
spectrum into the continuous one become possible.

In the case of λ < 0 the radial domain is ﬁnite the particle being conﬁned
to the spherical cavity of the radius r0 = 1/ω√

(21) will be square integrable over [0, r0) only if they are regular at r0. This

we have no continuous spectrum since the hypergeometric functions (18)
generally diverge for y

obtain the same result as in Ref. [7], i.e. the equidistant levels

All these results are similar with those obtained for the (1+1) models with
conformal transformations of de Sitter or anti-de Sitter metrics [1]. Moreover,
we can prove that the solutions we have obtained here are continuous with
respect to λ, as in the case of the (1+1) models. Indeed, when λ

which means that the ﬁnite discrete
spectra of the models with λ > 0 become countable while the continuous
spectra disappear. Hence it is obvious that the discrete spectra given by
(22) become (13) when λ
0. Furthermore, we can convince ourselves
that, in this limit, the radial wave functions (21) take the form (12) which
coincides to that of the NRHO radial wave functions. Thus, it results that
our solutions are continuous in λ. Based on this property we can calculate the
non-relativistic limit like in the (1+1) case, taking λ
0 and, in addition,

have the same non-relativistic limit, namely the NRHO.

Finally we note that the RRO with λ < 0 could be used as models of
geometric conﬁnement. The advantage here is that we have the new arbitrary
parameter λ which allows us to choose the desired values of the frequency
and of the radius of the spherical cavity. Moreover, the discrete spectra of
the RRO have a ﬁne-structure which could be useful in building new models
of this kind.

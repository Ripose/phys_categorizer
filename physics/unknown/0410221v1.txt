We  address  azimuthally  modulated  Bessel  optical  lattices  imprinted  in  focusing  cubic 

Kerr-type nonlinear media, and reveal that such lattices support different types of stable 

solitons,  whose  complexity  increases  with  growth  of  lattice  order.  We  reveal  that  the 

azimuthally modulated lattices cause single solitons launched tangentially to the guiding 

rings  to  jump  along  consecutive  sites  of  the  optical  lattice.  The  position  of  the  output 

channel can be varied by small changes of the launching angle.

Weak  transverse  modulation  of  refractive  index  of  nonlinear  medium  creates 

inhomogeneities that are capable to capture and hold optical radiation. In the simplest 

case  of  periodic  modulation  of  refractive  index,  the  waveguide  arrays  enable  the 

existence  of  discrete  solitons  formed  upon  the  competition  of  discrete  diffraction  and 

nonlinearity  [1].  Lattices  with  tunable  strength  introduce  new  opportunities  for  soliton 

control [2]. It was recently shown that such tunable lattices can be induced optically in 

photorefractive  medium  [3-9],  a  possibility  that  enables  controlling  both  the  lattice 

period and the refractive index modulation depth. The basic properties of one- and two-

dimensional  solitons  (including  dipole-mode  ones  and  soliton  complexes)  supported  by 

harmonic lattices are now well established [2-11].

In addition to the concept of tunable discreteness, the landmark idea of all-optical 

lattice  generation  with  nondiffracting  fields  opens  broad  prospects  for  creation  and 

exploration  of  lattices  with  different  symmetry.  For  example,  we  recently  put  forward 

the  properties  of  solitons  supported  by  radially  symmetric  optical  lattices,  induced  by 

non-diffracting Bessel beams [12]. Such beams can be created by illuminating a conical 

shaped  optical  element,  called  an  axicon,  with a Gaussian beam, or by using a narrow 

illuminated  annular  slit  that  is  placed  in  the  focal  plane  of  a  focusing  lens  [13].  More 

elaborated  holographic  techniques  can  be  used  to  produce  the  higher-order  azimuthally 

modulated  nondiffracting  beams  and  lattices.  In  this  paper  we  introduce  the  idea  of 

solitons  supported  by  such  type  of  lattices,  and  show  that  they  support  soliton 

complexes  that  intuitively  can  be  viewed  as  nonlinear  combinations  of  several  lowest-

order  solitons.  We  also  show  that  solitons  can  be  set  into  azimuthal  rotation  when 

launched  tangentially  to  the  main  guiding  ring  at  appropriate  angles.  Such  rotation  is 

accompanied  by  small  radiation  that  finally  leads  to  the  controllable  trapping  of  the 

solitons in one lattice ring. 

We consider propagation of optical radiation along the  z  axis of a bulk focusing 

cubic  medium  with  transverse  modulation  of  linear  refractive  index  described  by  the 

nonlinear Schrödinger equation for dimensionless complex field amplitude q :

describes  a  higher-order  azimuthally  modulated Bessel beam creating the lattice and is 

an exact solution of the linear homogeneous Schrodinger equation. We assume that the 

lattice  profile  mimics  the  intensity  profile  of  the  nondiffracting  beam,  as  it  occurs  in 

photorefractive crystals. Due to a specific field distribution in higher-order Bessel beams 

the  depth  of  azimuthal  refractive  index  modulation  in  the  lattice  is  100%.  Note  that

with several incoherent Bessel beams of different intensities and orders it is also possible 

to produce lattices that are weakly modulated in azimuthal direction. It is assumed that 

the  depth  of  the  refractive  index  modulation  is  small  compared  with  unperturbed 

refractive index and is of the order of nonlinear contribution to refractive index. Optical 

induction of lattices in photorefractive crystals is possible because of the large anisotropy 

of their nonlinear response. While linear anisotropy has almost no effect on propagation 

of  the  lattice-creating  Bessel  beam  (because  of  the  small  relative  difference

  between  elements  of  susceptibility  tensor),  only  the  nonlinear 

anisotropy  breaks  rotational  symmetry  and  affects  the  properties  of  solitons  supported 

by  Bessel  lattices.  We  checked  by  solving  the  full  system  of  material  equations  for 

photorefractive  crystals  that  main  results  (e.g.  possibility  of  azimuthal  switching  and 

existence  of  stable  soliton  complexes)  obtained  with  the  model  (1)  remain  valid  in  the 

presence of anisotropy of nonlinear response. Nevertheless, here we use model (1) since it 

also  holds  for  trapped  Bose-Einstein  condensates.  Typical  profiles  of  modulated  Bessel 

lattices with  n

 are shown in Fig. 1. The local lattice maxima situated closer to the 

lattice center are more pronounced than others and form a ring of guiding channels that 

will  be  referred  to  as  the  main  guiding  ring  of  the  lattice.  The  number  of  guiding 

channels  in  the  main  ring  is  given  by  2 ,  while  the  radius  of  the  main  ring  increases

in order to find perturbation profiles and growth rate. 

One-dimensional  and  two-dimensional  soliton  configurations  can  be  stable  only 

when  the  field  changes  sign  between  neighboring  channels.  Since  the  highest  refractive 

index modulation occurs for the main guiding ring of the modulated lattice, it is natural 

to  expect  that  the  main  guiding  ring  of  a  n -th  order  Bessel  lattice  can  support  stable 

soliton  complexes  formed  by 

2n

  out-of-phase  bright  spots.  The  properties  of  simplest 

soliton complexes or dipole solitons supported by the first-order lattice are summarized 

in Fig. 2. The typical profile of dipole solitons, found with a standard relaxation method, 

is shown in Fig. 2(a). Such soliton can be intuitively viewed as nonlinear combination of 

two  out-of-phase  lowest  orders  solitons  supported  by  two  guiding  sites  of  main  ring  of 

Bessel  lattice.  The  lattice  compensates  the  repulsive  interaction  between  out-of-phase 

solitons  and  makes  possible  their  propagation as a single entity. Energy flow U  of the 

dipole  soliton  is  a  nonmonotonic  function  of  propagation  constant  (Fig.  2(b)).  At  high 

energy flows when  b

 two spots forming dipole become narrow and almost do not 

interact.  At  small  lattice  depth

soliton vanishes in the cutoff, while its azimuthal width changes slightly. This behavior 

corresponds  to  discontinuity  in  the  cutoff  versus  lattice  depth  curve  (Fig.  2(c)).  A 

comprehensive  study  of  the  linear  stability  of  the  dipole  solitons  supported  by  Bessel 

lattices with moderate depth revealed the existence of an instability domain located close 

to the cutoff on the propagation constant (Fig. 2(d)). The corresponding instability is of 

an  oscillatory  type,  and  typically  Re

( )

.  Both  the  width  of  the  instability 

domain and the maximal real part of complex growth rate were found to decrease with 

growth  of  the  lattice  depth.  For  deep  enough  lattices  dipole  solitons  become  free  from 

instabilities in the entire domain of their existence. 

Properties  of  quadrupole  solitons  supported  by  second-order  lattice  are 

summarized in Fig. 3. Quadrupole solitons can be viewed as nonlinear superposition of 

four out-of-phase bright spots. Their properties are qualitatively similar to that of dipole 

solitons.  There  exist  lower  cutoff  on  propagation  constant  that  is  a  nonmonotonic 

function of the lattice depth with a discontinuity at 

p ≈
cr

7

 (Fig. 3(c)). A careful linear 

 

4

stability  analysis  revealed  that  the  structure  of  instability  domain  for  quadrupole 

solitons (located near the propagation constant cutoff) is rather complex, with separate 

“stability windows”, and both oscillatory and exponential instabilities may take place for 

such solitons. Thus Fig. 3(d) shows the widest instability band for quadrupole soliton at 

p =

16

.  At  moderate  lattice  depth  instability  vanishes  above  a  certain  propagation 

constant  threshold.  The  instability  domain  was  found  to  shrink  for  deep  lattices,  and 

quadrupole solitons were found to become stable in the entire domain of their existence. 

To  stress  that  the  concept  of  stable  soliton  complexes  can  be  generalized  to 

higher-order  structures,  we  have  studied  higher-order  lattices  with  n   up  to  10.  All  of 

them can support soliton complexes, whose properties are similar to that of dipole and 

quadrupole solitons (see Fig. 4 with examples of stable higher-order soliton complexes). 

Note  that  in  homogenous  media  soliton  complexes  (or  clusters)  tend  to  self-destroy 

through expansion or coalescence [14]. The instability may be reduced by the presence of 

competing nonlinearities, but even then the complexes exist as metastable objects [15]. 

Another intriguing opportunity afforded by azimuthally modulated Bessel lattices 

is that a single soliton initially located in one of the guiding sites of the main lattice ring 

and launched tangentially to the ring starts to travel along consecutive guiding sites of 

the  ring,  so  that  it  can  even  return  to  the  input  site.  In  pure  cubic  medium  soliton  is 

strongly  perturbed  when  it  leaves  the  guiding  site,  making  the  above  process  probably 

difficult  to  observe  in  practice.  However,  even  small  nonlinearity  saturation  makes  the 

process  very  robust.  To  illustrate  this  point  we  included  into  the  model  Eq.  (1)  small 

nonlinearity  saturation  by  rewriting  the  nonlinear  term  as 

−

2 /(1

S q+

,  where 

S (cid:19)

. In such case laser beam does not broaden in between guiding sites, and thus it is 

allowed  to  jump  from  one  site  to  another.  The  soliton  beam  was  set  in  motion  by 

imposing  on  it  an  initial  phase  tilt 

ηα η
when the soliton beam is initially located in the outermost left guiding site of the main 

.  Here  we  consider  the  situation

exp(

ζ

ring, and 

ηα =

0

. The soliton leaves the guiding site when  α  exceeds a certain critical 

ζ

value,  and  starts  to  travel  along  the  guiding  ring  if  α   is  not  too  high.  Since  solitons 

ζ

have  to  overcome  a  potential  barrier  when  passing  between  neighboring  sites,  they 

radiate a small fraction of energy. In the presence of radiation soliton can be trapped in 

different  guiding  sites  of  the  main  ring  and  position/number  of  output  site  can  be 

controlled easily by changing the launching angle or soliton energy flow (Fig. 5). Thus a 

 

5

higher  incident  angle  is  typically  required  to  achieve  trapping  of  soliton  with  higher 

energy  flow  into  the  desired  guiding  site.  The  potential  of  the  effect  to  implement 

controllable azimuthal soliton switching is clearly visible. 

Finally, we note that the azimuthal modulation of the lattice remarkably affects 

interactions experienced by solitons located in different guiding channels. When solitons 

carry  identical  energies  formation  of  even  or  dipole  soliton  is  possible.  However,  we 

found  that  when  solitons  carry  different  energies,  they  may  fuse  into  a  single  soliton, 

independently of the phase difference between input solitons. Fig. 6 shows the input and 

output field distributions for different energy flows of a control soliton, in the case when 

the control and the input solitons are out-of-phase. If the energy flow U  of the control 

c

soliton  considerably  exceeds  that  of  input  soliton  all  energy  is  concentrated  in  the  site 

where control soliton was located (Figs. 6(c), 6(d)). When energy flows are comparable 

the output soliton can be located in the same channel as input one (Figs. 6(a) and 6(b)). 

In  conclusion  we  showed  that  azimuthally  modulated  Bessel  optical  lattices 

support  soliton  complexes  that  can  be  made  stable  in  wide  regions  of  their  existence 

domain  by  varying  the  lattice  strength.  We  also  showed  that  single  solitons  launched 

tangentially  to  main  guiding  ring  of  the  lattice  can  be  trapped  by  its  different  guiding 

sites  depending  on  the  input  angle  and  energy  flow.  Note  that  optically  induced 

modulated Bessel lattices may find analogy with microstructured or photonic crystals.

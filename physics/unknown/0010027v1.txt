Abstract

Herein the Casimir effect is used to present a simple macroscopic view of the origin of

exotic matter.  The energy arising between two nearly perfectly conducting parallel plates

is shown to become increasingly negative as the plate separation is reduced.  It is

proposed that the Casimir energy appears increasingly negative simply because the

vacuum electromagnetic zero-point field performs positive work in pushing the plates

together, transforming field energy into kinetic energy of the plates.  Next, the inertial

properties of exotic matter are considered.  The parallel plates of the Casimir system are

replaced with an enclosed cavity of identical dimensions that is subjected to an external

force.  It is found that zero-point radiation exerts an inertial force on the cavity in

opposition to the external force.  This ultimately leads to the conclusion that the inertial

properties of exotic matter are identical to the inertial properties of ordinary matter.

1.  Introduction

According to a recent proposal by Miguel Alcubierre [1], general relativity admits

metric solutions that predict the possibility of superluminal space travel.  In essence,

2
these metrics imply that a spaceship can be propelled through space by expanding space-

time behind the ship while, at the same time, contracting space-time in front of the ship.

The ship then surfs on this space-time deformation, acquiring very high velocity relative

to the rest of the universe.  Even more surprising is that these “warp drive” metrics

predict that such travel can be carried out without the usual time dilation effects predicted

by special relativity.  That is, proper time experienced by a space traveler, using an

Alcubierre warp drive, is identical to the time experienced by observers remaining on the

Earth.

As with worm holes, warp drives require tremendous quantities of negative energy, or

exotic matter [1-5].  Although there are several conceptual difficulties associated with

warp drive, the energy requirement alone can easily be taken as sufficient grounds for us

to dismiss the feasibility of warp drive.  More encouraging, however, is that modified

forms of the Alcubierre metric have been proposed, requiring more reasonable quantities

of exotic matter [4-5].  We can only hope that as more research is conducted, warp drive

theory will become increasingly tenable.

Of course, there is one serious obstacle to our actually engineering a warp drive

system of any size: the need for exotic matter.  Before we can set up a physically

realizable warp drive, we must have a working knowledge of how to generate exotic

matter.  As is well known, exotic matter is forbidden classically, but is permitted on the

quantum level under special circumstances.  When these special circumstances are

applied to warp drive theory, we are left with a warp bubble requiring massive amounts

3
of exotic matter and having walls whose thickness is on the order of the Planck length [2-

3].  But even with such constraints, we are still left with the question of how to obtain

exotic matter, regardless of quantity.  It is an objective of the present analysis to provide a

simple macroscopic view of the origin of exotic matter while leaving the question of

quantity for future development.

One well-known example in which negative energy produces observable forces is the

Casimir effect [1, 4].  The Casimir effect is an attractive force that arises between two

nearly perfectly conducting parallel plates when they are placed in close proximity, as

shown in Figure 1.  In essence, the plates block out some of the vacuum zero-point

electromagnetic radiation that would otherwise reside in the volume between the plates

were the plates removed [6-7].  This gives rise to a small energy difference between the

plates relative to the region outside the plates:

where 

2L  is the surface area of each plate, and  r  is the plate separation.  Differentiating

Eq. (1) with respect to the plate separation then gives the force on the plates:

This attractive force, tending to push the plates together, has been experimentally verified

to within 5% of its theoretical value [7].

While the Casimir effect is typically reserved for discussions involving the quantum

4

world, there may in fact be a way to picture the negative energy-content of the Casimir

system from a macroscopic point of view.  This can be done by taking a macroscopic

view of the vacuum electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF).  With this approach, the ZPF

is viewed as a real Lorentz-invariant radiation field that is essentially uniform throughout

all of space.  So long as the ZPF is isotropic, no direct observation of the ZPF can be

made; but if the ZPF becomes locally anisotropic, such as with the Casimir system, direct

observations can then indeed be carried out [7-8].

The next Section deals with the change in Casimir energy that arises when the plate

separation is decreased.  It is shown that the ZPF performs positive work in pushing the

plates together, transforming electromagnetic field energy into kinetic energy of the

plates.  The resulting drop in field energy appears increasingly negative with respect to

the uniform energy content outside the plates [8-9].  Based on this, it is proposed that

whenever the ZPF performs positive work in a localized region of space-time, a drop in

zero-point field energy occurs, resulting in a negative energy density relative to the rest

of space-time.

Section 3 is devoted to acquiring greater insight into the inertial properties of exotic

matter.  Applying the law of inertia of energy [10-11] to the Casimir energy leads to a

negative inertial mass.  Initially, it seems that this small quantity of exotic matter should

reduce the overall inertia of the Casimir system.  To determine whether this is indeed the

case, the parallel plates of the Casimir system are replaced with a cavity of identical

5
dimensions.  When the cavity is subjected to an external force, space-time distortion [12]

within the cavity gives rise to a Doppler-shift, detectable within the co-moving reference

frame of the cavity.  It is shown that zero-point radiation responds to this Doppler-shift

by exerting an inertial resistance force on the cavity in a manner identical to that of

ordinary, positive radiation [10].  This leads to the conclusion that the inertial properties

of exotic matter are the same as the inertial properties of ordinary matter.

2. Negative Energy due to Work Performed by Zero-Point Field

Consider the energy between two parallel plates when their separation is first  1r  and

then later  2r , where  1r  >  2r .  According to Eq. (1), when the plate separation is  1r  and  2r

the energy between the plates is, respectively

(3b)

As pointed out in the Introduction, the force between the plates is attractive, tending to

push the plates together.  Suppose the force pushes the plates from separation  1r  to

separation  2r .  The change in energy between the plates is then

This implies that the Casimir energy becomes increasingly negative as the plate

separation is reduced.  The work W performed in order to bring about this change in

energy is

This is positive work performed by the ZPF in pushing the plates from  1r  to  2r ,

transforming electromagnetic field energy into kinetic energy of the plates.  Since the

energy content of the ZPF is initially uniform everywhere [8-9], this drop in field energy

manifests as a negative energy density between the plates, relative to the energy density

of the region outside the plates.

Of particular interest is the case in which the initial separation of the parallel plates is

very large.  Assuming that no other forces act on the plates, the ZPF should still exert a

force on the plates, no matter how minute that force may be.  The work performed by that

force can be expressed simply by taking the limit of Eq. (5) as  1r  tends to infinity:

in which the subscript  2r  has been dropped for simplicity.  This is the work performed by

the ZPF in pushing two parallel plates to a separation r when the plates are initially very

far apart.  The potential energy associated with Eq. (7) is then

which is identical to the original expression for the Casimir energy, given by Eq. (1).  So

then, we have come full circle, but with the clear assertion that the negative energy

density of the Casimir system arises because the ZPF performs positive work in a

localized region of space-time.  More specifically, we propose that in any instance in

which the ZPF performs positive work in a localized region of space-time, a drop in

vacuum electromagnetic zero-point field energy occurs, resulting in a negative energy

density in that region relative to the rest of space-time [9].

3.  Inertial Properties of Exotic Matter

In the preceding section, the Casimir system of two conducting parallel plates was

used to show that when the ZPF performs positive work in a localized region, the energy

density of that region becomes negative.  Taking a strict view of the relationship between

energy and mass [10], we might suppose that such a region exhibits an inertial mass in

accordance with the law of inertia of energy, 

m U c∞=

2

.  Applying this expression to

the Casimir energy, given by Eq. (8), leads directly to

m

π= −

.

(9)

This implies that the mass-energy between the plates of the Casimir system is negative

with respect to the exterior region.  At first sight, we might expect this small quantity of

exotic matter should reduce the overall inertial mass of the Casimir system.  As we shall

8

see, however, we have no good reason to presuppose that exotic matter behaves in any

way differently than does ordinary matter.

According to previous analyses [10-11, 13], the inertial properties of energy cannot be

adequately explained on the basis of inertial mass alone; the contribution by space-time

must also be taken into account.  This was demonstrated by considering an ideal cavity of

length r, containing monochromatic radiation of frequency 

ν  that is subjected to an

0

external force [10].  It was found that when an external force is applied to such a cavity,

radiation pressure exerts an inertial resistance force on the cavity, given by

"
F

=

Nh
r

(
ν ν

−

A

B

)

"
n

,

(10)

where  N  is the average number of photons in the cavity,  A

ν  and  B

ν  are the frequencies

of radiation measured by co-moving observers at walls A and B of the cavity,

respectively, and  ˆn  is a unit vector in the direction of the cavity’s acceleration.  This

expression for the force was used to show that the inertial resistance of the cavity arises

as a direct manifestation of space-time distortion within the cavity [10, 12].

The plan here is to use Eq. (10) to gain greater insight into the inertial properties of

exotic matter.  To do this, the parallel plates of the Casimir system are replaced with a

cavity of identical dimensions, namely one with r << L, as shown in Figure 2.  Also, the

zero-point radiation under consideration here is not monochromatic, and thus the average

9
indicated by  N  must be eliminated in favor of a sum over all frequency modes within the

cavity.  Carrying this out, Eq. (10) can be recast in the form

(11)

where N is the number of modes within the cavity [14].  For the case of a cavity in

thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, the number of photons observed at each wall

within the cavity is roughly the same.  Using this to our advantage, Eq. (11) can then be

written as

Observers residing in the co-moving reference frame (CMRF) of the cavity find that

(17)

where dt is an interval of coordinate time,  τd  is an interval of proper time experienced

by observers moving with the cavity, and the minus sign arises because the gradient is in

the direction of the cavity’s acceleration [10].  Substituting Eq. (17) into Eq. (16) then

gives the force as

point energy within the cavity:

N

(19)

At this point, it must be stressed that although the energy density within the cavity is

negative with respect to exterior regions, individual photons inside the cavity have their

usual positive energies, 

E ω= !

i

i

.  The cavity simply blocks out those photons having

wavelengths longer than the distance between the walls of the cavity [7].

Using Eq. (19) in Eq. (18), the force on the cavity then becomes

"
F

"

= − ∇


E





dt
dτ

.

(20)

According to this expression, zero-point radiation within the cavity exerts an inertial

force on the cavity that acts in opposition to the externally applied force, just as does

ordinary, positive radiation [10, 15].  Thus, the inertial properties of a region having a

negative energy density are identical to those of a region having an equivalent positive

energy density.  Previous analyses have shown that all forms of positive energy resist

changes to their states of motion, and that the source of such resistance is entirely due to

space-time distortion arising within accelerating systems of reference [10-11, 13].

Equation (20) implies that the same holds true for negative forms of energy as well.  We

can conclude, therefore, that the inertial properties of exotic matter are the same as the

inertial properties of ordinary matter.  Both forms of matter resist changes to their states

of motion when acted upon by an external force.

Returning to the Casimir system, it is now easy to see that the inertial mass predicted

12

by Eq. (9) will contribute to an overall increase in the inertia of the Casimir system rather

than reducing it, as the minus sign initially suggested.  While the minus sign in Eq. (9)

certainly implies that the mass is exotic, having its origin in negative energy, the minus

sign tells us nothing about the inertial properties of exotic matter.

4.  Discussion

Current theory places serious restrictions on the existence of exotic matter.  According

to recent analyses, such restrictions set the thickness of the walls of an Alcubierre warp

bubble on the order of the Planck length while requiring an enormous quantity of exotic

matter [2-3].  In the present analysis, a simple macroscopic interpretation of the origin of

exotic matter and its inertial properties has been suggested while leaving the question of

quantity for future development.

Current theory predicts that the energy density between two nearly perfectly

conducting parallel plates is negative, resulting in an attractive force between the plates

[1, 4].  Herein, it was shown that this Casimir energy is negative simply because the

vacuum electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF) performs positive work in pushing the

plates together, leading to a drop in field energy between the plates relative to the region

outside the plates.  Since the energy content outside the plates is uniformly distributed,

and thus undetectable [7-8], the energy density between the plates appears negative.

Applying the law of inertia of energy [10-11] to the Casimir system led to a negative

13

inertial mass.  At first sight, it seemed that the presence of this small quantity of exotic

matter should reduce the overall inertia of the Casimir system.  To determine whether this

is indeed the case, a cavity of identical dimensions that is subjected to an external force

was considered.  It was found that zero-point radiation within such a cavity responds to

space-time distortion within the cavity in a manner identical to that of ordinary, positive

radiation [10].  This led to the conclusion that the inertial properties of a region

possessing a negative energy density are identical to the inertial properties of a region

possessing an equivalent positive energy density.

Of course, the validity of the interpretation set forth herein is ultimately hinged on

whether or not the ZPF is comprised of real radiation, and on the amount of work that can

be performed thereby.  Judging from the literature on the subject, whether or not the ZPF

is real seems to be an ongoing debate [7-9].  Assuming that the ZPF is indeed real and

capable of performing electromagnetic work [9], we propose that whenever the ZPF

performs positive work in a localized region of neutral space-time, a net drop in energy

occurs in that region.  The magnitude of such a drop in energy is directly proportional to

the quantity of work performed, and expresses itself in the form of exotic matter.

Furthermore, we conclude that the inertial properties of exotic matter are identical to the

inertial properties of ordinary matter; both forms of matter resist changes to their states of

motion.

As a final thought, it is interesting to speculate on how the notions put forth herein

14

might be applied to warp drive theory, mentioned in the Introduction.  From a

hypothetical standpoint, we can imagine a spaceship, residing in Minkowski space-time,

which carries out some sort of internal process that alters the ZPF outside the ship [16].

If, through this process, the ship can coax the ZPF into performing substantial

electromagnetic work, then the ship can use the ZPF to generate the exotic matter

required for warp drive.  In essence, we imagine a spaceship that manipulates the ZPF in

order to generate stress-energy outside the ship.  With the right configuration, this stress-

energy can be used to alter the Minkowski geometry outside the ship, forming an

Alcubierre-type geometry, or some more efficient variation thereof [1, 4-5].  Assuming

that all goes as planned, the spaceship should then be propelled by the resulting space-

time geometry, acquiring very high velocity relative to the rest of the universe.  One

noteworthy feature of this model is that there is no need for the spaceship to carry a

quantity of exotic matter on board for use as a fuel source.  Rather, such a spaceship

would generate exotic matter outside the ship as it moves through space.

[14] There are two effective limits on the number of modes within the cavity.

Wavelengths greater than the dimensions of the cavity are blocked out of the

interior region, and wavelengths shorter that the atomic size do not contribute to the

force on the walls of the cavity.  These limits are generally embodied in a cut-off

function.  See, for example, Refs. [6-8].

[15] Of course, exterior ZPF radiation should contribute to the resistance force on an

accelerating cavity as well.  This arises because the cavity occupies a volume of

space, and essentially plows through a sea of zero-point radiation in much the same

way as a submarine moves through water.

[16] It seems likely that this process will be cyclical.  It is difficult to imagine any static

embodiment capable of maintaining a sizable alteration of the ZPF.

Abstract 

Transverse feedback systems for controlling the vertical 
coupled-bunch  instabilities  in  the  positron  and  electron 
main  rings  are  installed  at  DAΦNE.  They  started  to  be 
operative  respectively  from  June  and  September  2000. 
For  the  horizontal  plane,  similar  systems  have  been 
installed in summer 2001 with less kicker power. Design 
specifications  and 
the  basic  system  concepts  are 
presented.  Real  time  bunch-by-bunch  offset  correction  is 
implemented using digital signal processors and dual-port 
RAM’s. Fast analog to digital sampling is performed at the 
maximum  bunch  frequency  (368  MHz).  The  system 
manages at full speed a continuous flow of 8-bits data and 
it  has  the  capability  to  invert  the  sign  or  put  to  zero  the 
output  for  any  combination  of  bunches.  A  conversion 
from  digital  to  analog  produces  the  output  correcting 
signal. 

1 INTRODUCTION 
DAΦNE  is  a  φ−factory,  mainly  dedicated  to  the  study 
of CP violation, currently in operation at Frascati (Italy). 
It has achieved a peak luminosity of ~5*1031 cm-2s-1 in the 
Kloe  detector  interaction  region.  Moreover,  maximum 
currents  of  1411mA  in  the  electron  ring  and  1150mA  in 
the  positron  one  have  been  stored.  In  Table  1,  some 
DAΦNE parameters are shown.

At the beginning of 2000, during commissioning, it was 
decided  to  install  vertical  feedback  systems  on  the  two 
main rings. Similar devices have been successfully used in 
other  colliders  or  synchrotron  light  sources  [1 - 7], 
however the design of our system is peculiar under some 
aspects.  The  design  of  the  system  developed  at  the 
Frascati  laboratory  was  stepped  in  two  phases:  the  first

In the second phase, the feedback system includes new 
modules  added  to  the  first  version  setup;  it  is  currently 
under test. It can allow more flexibility in the system and 
a  better  performance  of  the  power  stage  by  computing  a 
more  efficient  signal  by  a  bunch-by-bunch  offset 
correction scheme. 

2 THE INSTALLED TRANSVERSE 
FEEDBACK SYSTEM 
A  four buttons beam position monitor produces pulses 
at  the  passage  of  a  bunch.    It  is  possible  to  generate  a 
difference signal connecting the up and down (or left and 
right)  button  to  a  hybrid  junction.    Fast  analog  to  digital 
sampling  of  the  signal  is  performed  at  base  band  at  the 
DAΦNE  Radio  Frequency  (368  MHz)  by  a  MAX101A, 
an  8-bits  ADC  by  MAXIM.  The  system  manages  at  full 
speed a continuous stream of data and it has the capability 

 

 

frequency  (>3MHz).  In  a  typical  run,  the  DSP  computes 
and  updates  continuously  the  average  value  for  each 
bucket  (empty  or  not).  Then  it  puts  the  results  in  a  dual 
port RAM (CY7C024 by CYPRESS). An 8 bits digital to 
analog  converter  (TQ6122  by  Triquint)  outputs  at 
368MHz the value to be subtracted from the input signal. 
The hold buffer is circular and it is scanned with a proper 
delay. The four modules are shown in figure 4. 
 

to  invert  the  sign  or  put  to  zero  the  output  for  single  or 
multiple values in real time. To manage a so fast flow of 
the  ECLinPS  family 
data,  ECL  components  from 
MC100E  (by  Motorola)  are  used.  Printed  circuit  boards 
with traces at controlled impedance have been designed at 
the  Frascati 
laboratory.  The  skew  between  16+1 
differential  signals  is  a  very  critical  parameter  and 
requires a careful lay out of the PCB traces. A conversion 
from digital to analog produces the bunch-by-bunch error 
signal that, after a stage of pre-amplification, is sent as a 
correcting signal to the power amplifiers. Figure 2 shows 
the  correction  signal  and  the  kicker  signal.  In  this 
implementation  of  the  system  local orbit bumps are used 
to  avoid  saturation  of  the  power  amplifiers  due  to  the 
static  and  not  useful  part  of  the  signal  coming  from  the 
orbit.

The  digital  signal  processor  can  address  up  to  128 
Kbytes  of  programs,  including  an  FFT  routine.  It  has  a 
interface  for  debugging  purposes.  Moreover, 
JTAG 
through  a  4  MHz  synchronous  serial  interface  that  can 
connect up to eight slave devices to a master, it is possible 
to  exchange  commands  and  data  following  the  pseudo 
language  listed  in  Table 2.  The  post  processing  software 
still is under development.

3 THE UPGRADED FEEDBACK SYSTEM 
The upgraded version of the system adds two modules 
to the previous ones to improve flexibility and efficiency 
of  the  power  stage.  The  simplified  scheme  is  shown  in 
Figure 3.

The system shown in figure 4 is currently under test in 
the laboratory. A good manner to evaluate its linearity and 
to prove that the internal skew is adequate can be realized 
by sending to the input a ramp in the working range of the 
ADC.  Then  the  digital  data cross the modules and at the 
end of the chain are converted again to an analog signal. 
The result of this test is shown in figure 5.

4 CONCLUSIONS 

The  vertical 

feedback  system  damps  efficiently 
coherent instabilities in DAΦNE, allowing the storage of 
1411 mA in the electron ring and 1150 mA in the positron 
one. The increase of the stored currents was a crucial item 
in  the  improvement of peak and average luminosity. The 
system  has  shown  a  reliable  behaviour  during  more  then 
one  year  and  it  has  offered  in  the  same  time  useful 
diagnostics  to  manage  it  correctly.  The  next  upgrade  of 
the  system  is  expected  to  further  improve  DAΦNE 
performance.

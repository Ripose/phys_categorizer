Abstract 

It is shown that the noncommutative Lorentz metric satisfies so-called 
nonpropagating waves. The electromagnetic and gravitational forces are obtained as a 
description of these wave motions in a certain dispersive medium. This approach leads to 
the natural introduction of the field values (group velocity and intensity of de Broglie 
waves) into Maxwell's equations and antimatter into Newtonian mechanics. This paper 
illustrates the important theoretical motivations of using radio astronomy technique for 
the Sagnac effect and cosmic ray study. One of the early predictions of the wave theory 
was existence of antiparticles (modes with negative group velocity). They are attracted by 
ordinary matter, but repulse ordinary matter and each other gravitationally. The 
interaction between the two types of matter could lead to expansion of the universe and 
maintain the energy reservoir for cosmic sources of intense radiation. 
 

 

 

Introduction 
It is presently believed that physical experiments may detect acceleration, for 

There is also a difficulty with the mathematical formulation modern theory of 

 
example a rotation (Sagnac experiment, Foucault pendulum, etc.), but no physical 
experiments can detect a uniform translation. The anisotropy of the cosmic microwave 
background contradicts to the results of the traditional relativistic experiments, and we 
cannot see any evidence of earth orbital rotation from measuring the Sagnac effect on 
open paths.  
 
electromagnetic wave propagation that is based on the postulate about constancy of the 
light velocity. In continuum mechanics, the Lorentz transformation is a mathematical tool 
that preserves a wave equation in a moving reference system instead of time invariance in 
Galilean transformation. As it is true for all wave motions, in all applications of the 
Lorentz transformation anisotropy values of characteristic wave velocity are used.  
 
The most important difference between the Lorentz and Galilean transformations 
-noncommutative character of the Lorentz group is connected with wave properties of the 
observed phenomena. Historically, a long time before quantum mechanics, Fogt 
introduced Lorentz transformation in the elastic light theory. Then Lorentz came with a 
wave concept of relativity. He supposed that some disturbances, like waves, could be 
transmitted with traveling particles through a certain medium-ether without moving it.

Lorentz Group and Dispersive Waves  
In classical field theory, the Lorentz transformation could be derived as local 

relations-differential equations relating the coordinates of two reference systems, K and 
K', in relative motion [1]. We have

In general case, the dispersion relation is determined by particular equations of 

the problem. For linear equation it is simply based on correspondence ∂/∂t↔-iω, 
∂/∂x↔k, where k is a wave vector and ω is a frequency. Derivatives of the function t' are 
connected by dispersion relations ω2=c2k2+ωc
2, where ωc is a constant. These waves are 
known in classical continuum mechanics as the nonpropagation waves.  

 

2 

Major characteristics of these waves are: 1) They are described by the Klein-

Gordon equations. 2) The group and phase velocity are related by vu=c2. 3) The group 
velocity is always less than characteristic velocity c. 4) The group velocity approaches 
zero for frequency below ωc, which is called the cutoff frequency.  5) The wave system 
becomes nondispersive in the limit k→∝ with v=u=c [2]. 

These waves also occur in vacuum. In this case ωc =mc2/

Propagation of Wave Disturbances and Path Integrals 

The linear combination of the waves can be made to satisfy any boundary and 

 
initial conditions. In general, the Fourier integrals give exact solutions, but their content 
is difficult to see. To understand the main features of nonpropagation waves we consider 
the asymptotic behavior for large x and t.

 and 

In this case, we can determine each path using the method of stationary phase 

where 
 
developed by Kelvin. The basic idea in Kelvin's approach is that the main contribution to 
the integral comes from the small intervals centered about those values of β for which the 
phases of the exponential are stationary. Because α is large we have approximately

We discuss the character of the motion furnished by (9) in more detail. Indeed for 

 
 
not too great changes in x or t the waves behave very like simple harmonic waves of a 
certain period and wavelength. Because the period T correspond to change 2π in the 
phase, we have

As we can see, the position x of group of waves of fixed wavelength at time t is 

given by the formula 

 

 

 

 

(12)  

or x=vt, where the group velocity is a constant. In contrast, the phase velocity is not 
constant. The distinction between these velocities is crucial, and the group velocity plays 
the dominant role. It determines the propagation of wave vector/frequency and variations 
in amplitude or wave energy density. 

In continuum mechanics, instead of dispersive waves, it is perhaps more precise 

to speak of a dispersive medium in which the waves are generated. A general approach is 
usually based on variation principle. The continuity equation is rather the conservation of 
wave action, which in simple cases becomes energy conservation equation. In those cases 
where Lagrangian is the difference of kinetic and potential energy, equipartition exists 
between two stationary values.  

The problems of slowly varying wave train in continuum mechanics are 
analogous to the problems of adiabatic invariant in the mechanics of finite systems. For a 
wave associated with a free particle the elementary action is ds=h*dθ=L*dt and the 
energy is E=p*v-L. In this case, the total energy is a constant of integration. For a particle 
with rest mass m and linear momentum p the total energy is E2=p2c2+m2c4. 

We obtained the propagation formulas from the wave theory that supposed that 

the wave disturbance caused by deviation in the limited space region is the sum of simple 
harmonic waves of different amplitudes and wave vectors. Since our medium is a 
disperse medium the disturbances with increasing time break up into separate trains of 
waves each of which has approximately the same wave length. Also, we assumed that the 
probability of finding the particle at a given point and time is proportional to the intensity 
of associated wave. 

This is very close to Feynman's results, which he received another way using the 

method of path integral. We have in the limit v/c→0 from (9) his amplitude of probability

Feynman and Hibbs come to this formula from an idea that all paths for particles 

(13) 

.  

 

are possible but not all, however, have the equal probability. For the large particles the 
contribution of the waves with phases far to stationary phase almost completely cancel 
one another. Thus, the particle follows a path that satisfies the principle of least action. 

4 

The analogy of the material and quantum nonpropagating waves naturally appears 

when we consider wave disturbances on an infinite strip of width h. If x(z,yt) is the 
deflection of the strip, the solutions satisfying the certain boundary conditions  are 
x=eiqsin(πmy/h). These solutions are normal modes with the cutoff frequency ωc=πmc/h. 
Here c is the characteristic speed and m is the order of the mode. A nondispersive mode 
corresponds m=0. 

As we approach wavelengths comparable with interatomic space a, the frequency 
of the oscillation should be computed in terms of the mass of the atom m and the elastic 
constant of the strip material βa. To simplify the calculations, we consider it as a one-
dimensional string of atoms. Then the force on the nth atom is equal 
 
 
−
where xn is the deviation of the nth atom from the equilibrium position. It can be shown 
that xn=Anei(ωt+kna) and

We now can find the number of oscillations u(k) with frequencies between k and 

k+dk. The entire treatment is essentially the same of that used with waves in material 
strings, electromagnetic fields and nuclear matter. As the length of the string or the lattice 
constant in the case of the crystal is L, we have in k-space u(k)=L/2π and

Here, the appearance of a discrete set of N-1 allowed values of k in is connected 

with string structure of N atoms. For wavelengths shorter than the mean distance between 
the atoms, propagation becomes impossible. The mode density per unit frequency 

interval is u(k)(dk/dν)dν. We have from (15) that

 and νm=(4β/m)1/2. 

As the string density ρ=m/a, the characteristic speed c=(βa/ρ)1/2=aνm/2. 

We then apply statistical mechanics to these modes to determine the mean energy 
at the temperature T. The probability that the mode has an energy corresponding to its nth 
allowed value is e-nhν/KT for a given energy En=nhν. Here n is a positive integer and K is 
Boltzmann's constant. As the material modes have only one frequency, we obtain the 
mean energy for the characteristic frequency

As a=10-8 cm and c=3*105 cm/s, the maximum frequency νm=2c/a of the material 
oscillation is less than 1014s-1, and the discrete character of energy of the sound waves is 
usually considered at low temperatures. As we go to higher frequencies, quantization of 
energy is easier to observe. The assumption that the maximum frequencies of the waves 
in background medium is about 1022s-1 leads to restriction on its characteristic size 
a=2c/νm=10-16 m and energy density

It is known that Maxwell perceived his equations as descriptions of the physical 

characteristics of a certain medium-ether. He described the state of the ether by two 
directed magnitudes, the electric and magnetic fields, whose changes in space and time 
are connected by four field equations. The first part of the force in (18), which does not 
depend on the velocity  v , is called the electric field intensity. The second part is 
perpendicular to this velocity. It is called the magnetic field intensity.

It can be shown that electromagnetic energy is equal Ε=1/8π∫(E2 + H2)dr, where 

integration is over all the space available to the field. To determine the way, in which this 
energy is distributed among the various frequencies, one can use Fourier analysis. In so 
doing, one can see that the electromagnetic field behaves like a collection of simple mode

perihelion of planetary orbits per revolution, p is the semi-major axis, e is the 
eccentricity. It is convenient to think of relativistic medium energy in terms of mass 
density. From dimensional analysis one might expect that the characteristic wave speed is 
c2=p/ρ. The assumption that it is equal to the velocity of light leads to restriction on 
equivalent mass density ρ=p/c2≈1017 kg/m3. 
 

Strong Forces and Cosmic Ray Acceleration 

From a classical point of view, it is necessary to introduce forces that hold the 

Coulomb repulsive forces of the electrical charge in equilibrium. At first, Poincare 
introduced a scalar cohesive pressure that holds electrons together. A classical view of 
the electron pictures it as a sphere, whose rest mass energy mc2 is the energy stored in its 
electrical field. For the relativistic medium pressure of about 1036 N/m2, the electron 
radius is about 0.1fm (10-15 m).  

Recently, Aspden calculated the proton mass. He suggested that the background 

medium might have a simple cubic lattice of negatively charged particles. These particles 
describe a circle in a background continuum of positive charges. Aspden received that 
energy quantum Q and proton mass M are connected by formula M=(4+2*61/2)*Q. Here 
the quantum Q is equal to the energy contained within a lattice cell and is slightly smaller 
than the mass energy of muon. It is associated with the cohesive pressure required to keep 
lattice particles from disintegrating [3].   

Following Jones, we assumed that the pressure of relativistic medium produced 
the strong but short-range attractive force. For example, a 50,000-N strong force holds 
quarks together to form protons. As the particles separate and the medium follows 
between them, the binding force goes to zero. A 1,000-N residual effect of medium 
pressure holds the protons and unstable neutrons together to form the nucleus. Balance of 
binding nuclear and repulsive electromagnetic forces determines the structure and 
characteristics of the stable nuclei.  

The electric force becomes dominant at separation of more than a few fm. We can 

describe this effect in terms of the potential energy. To a first approximation for simple 
nuclei, it may be represented by the infinite square well. Taking into account the Pauli 
exclusion principle, we have for a nucleus with the A nucleons and the total number of 

the modes k2≤K2

All nuclei have essentially the same density ρ and binding energy Eb. As their 
 
radii are approximately R=R0A1/3, then the density of nuclear matter is ρ=A/V=3/4πR3
and KF=1.52/R0. As R0=1.2 fm and Eb=8MeV, we have that the nuclear well potential 
energy U=EF+Eb=42MeV.

The relativistic dispersion relation or Dirac's formula for particle energy leads to 
the existence of quantum states with negative energy and negative-mass particles (modes 
with negative group velocity). According the Newton's laws antiparticles, which have the 
direction of their acceleration opposite to that of the force, are accelerated toward the 
positive mass. But they repulse each other gravitationally. Therefore, antiparticles tend to 
fill the entire cosmic space with approximately homogenous density. 

In this wave model, the fundamental distinction in matter and antimatter 
gravitational acceleration could be responsible for the present asymmetric situation. The 
universe began as a giant sphere, which contained equal amount of matter and antimatter 
(the total internal energy is zero).  Enormous amount of energy and radiation resulted 
from their interactions. When galaxies began to condense and the net gravitational 
attraction slightly reduced, the universe started expanding. The expansion cooled not only 
matter but also radiation. 

Obviously stars cannot contain a close mixture of matter and antimatter. 
However, no observations presently exclude the presence of the large amount of 
antimatter concentrated in the outer part of the universe or trapped between the widely 
separated clusters of galaxies. For the galaxies the gravitational force acting between 
them could consist of the ordinary attractive force and repulsive force associated with 
antimatter expansion.  

We consider an arbitrary spherical shell of matter expanded with antimatter. If the 
shell with radius R encloses a mass M, gravitational potential energy of a test particle (for 
example, galaxy) is -GM/R per unit mass. The kinetic energy of expansion is v2/2 per 
unit mass. The recession speed v could be expressed with the Hubble law as v=HR, 
where H is the constant. From the conservation of energy principle we have

where u is the internal energy of the universe per unit mass. 

As electric fields are rare in the fully ionized interstellar plasma, cosmic ray 
energy conserves in the cosmic space. The antimatter cannot be a closed system in 
thermodynamic equilibrium. Some long-range interaction between the two types of 
matter must present. In this case, observed energy spectrum of the primary cosmic rays 
might be partially explained by its interactions with matter/antimatter.  

To develop this point of view, we consider a moving particle of kinetic energy E, 
charge ze and velocity v. On the interactions with the distant electrons and positrons both 
a loss and gain of energy might take place. This energy gain must come from the negative 
kinetic energy of positrons, when their energy is reduced. Gain of energy is larger than 
losses because the traditional particles are more condensed.

Here the factor k is introduced to account for the fact that matter is more condensed than

, beyond which the Coulomb field of the fast particle 

is screened by collective motion of the electrons/positrons. If the coefficient k=0.5, the 
density of electron-positron pairs with KT/mc2=0.01 is n=1cm-3, the rate of energy gain is 
about 10-17L ev/cm for protons and 5*10-15L ev/cm for iron nuclei, where L is the size of 
the acceleration region. 

The mean energy acquired by a particle is a product of an absorption mean free 
path L, charge ze and the gain of energy per unit path E=zeLdE/dx. The cosmic proton 
energy gain in time is a product of dE/dx, their density nc and the velocity of light c, then 
dW/dt=cncdE/dx. The energy density gain occurs whenever the relativistic particle 
concentration exists relatively close to antimatter. For example, for a space region of 
volume 1045cm3 with nc=10-3 cm-3 the energy output could be about 1034 W [4]. 

If the place of the production and acceleration of the cosmic rays up to energy 
1015ev is a supernova (SN) explosion in matter-rich part of the universe, the particles 
escaping into outer antimatter-rich part of the universe can gain kinetic energy and then 
pass back with energy up to 1018ev. A cloud of antimatter extending 3,000 light years 
above the center of our Galaxy may be the source of cosmic ray acceleration to energy 
above the GZK cutoff (1020ev). In this approach, iron nuclei could dominate in the ultra 
high-energy cosmic ray flux.  

Since the galactic SN rate is two per century and cosmic ray lifetime is 2*107 
years, it should be a stationary cosmic ray flux. For a sphere with uniform density of 
sources S and macroscopic absorption cross-section Σa, the average flux is 
F≈S/π*(Σa+DB2) and leakage probability P=B2L2/(1+ B2L2). Here the buckling B=π/R 
and the diffusion mean free path L2=D/Σa. If D=2*1018cm, R=1030cm, Σa=2*10-25cm-1, 
L=1022cm and S≈10-24 p/s*cm3, we have average cosmic ray flux F≈1.5 p/s*cm2 and 
leakage probability P≈10-15.  

This approach might be analyzed with the recent observations of the gamma-ray 
burster large energy output, the ultra high-energy cosmic ray anisotropy and the Fermi's 
interpretation of the muon-decay experiments in mind. In the muon-decay experiments, 
the absorption of muons that are created by cosmic rays in Earth's atmosphere is larger 
than that of equal masses of condensed material. Fermi suggested that screening 
properties of the medium are an important factor in the interpretation observed difference 
in muon absorption in air and condensed materials [5].

Radio Astronomical Analysis of the Velocity Effects on Atomic Clocks 
The traditional relativistic experiments are analyzed here as special cases of the 

more general effect-Sagnac effect on open paths. The uniform translation is simply a 
limited case with infinitely great radius, and the earth’s rotation around the sun was often 
treated as a translation in the relativistic experiments. On another hand, with two signals 
starting at one point, we have the traditional Sagnac effect on closed path.  

In the Sagnac experiments, the two signals are sending in the opposite directions 
along the same path S=ϕR, where ϕ is central angle and R is radius. When the system is 
set in rotation with angular rate Ω, path length differences will result for the two signals 
∆S1,2 =ΩRt1,2=vt1,2 (see Fig.1). 

It usually had been considered that Sagnac measured only anisotropy angular 

velocity not linear. As t1=(S+∆S1)/c, t2 =(S-∆S2)/c we have

In the case of the Sagnac effect on open paths connected with atomic clock 
synchronization, the two effects are measured simultaneously: difference of clock 
frequencies and difference of transmission times. The atomic clock is based on condition 
νh=∆E
periodical signal lasts for a finite time. To simplify we consider that the train propagates 
in x direction and consists of exactly n waves of wavelength λ=c/ν.  

and essentially represents a frequency standard. A wave train results when a 

If the train reaches the point x0 at the t0 and leaves x1 at the time t1, we have c(t1 -

t0)=x1-x0 +nλ and n=ν(t1-t0 -∆x/c). By using Galilean transformation we can compute n 
exactly in the same way in a moving system

We have from (27) that frequency and velocity change proportionally due to motion of 
light receiving systems ν/c=ν'/c'. The GPS and radio astronomy techniques might provide 
an independent experimental procedure to estimate the frequency effect. For measuring 
the frequency effect of the moving atomic clocks, we consider that the atomic clocks are 
associated with the radio telescopes. The simple digital electronics can be used at the 
experiments with ground or satellite clocks (Fig.2).  

The received signals come to the counter controlled by the scaler. The scaler 

counts local clock pulses and after a certain predetermined number has been counted, it 
sends a short start/stop signal to the counters and data acquisition system. To test the 
electronics setup stability as a function of time of day several 4-hours runs using cable 
connection were performed. To define whether the period of the clock's frequency 
variations is the solar or sideral day the measurements extending over several hours will 
be made periodically during the day. Two methods might be used: observations one 
source close to the ecliptic pole and observations of pair sources of equal elevation [6].

The Sagnac effect holds for any type of waves. It can be shown that the Sagnac 

phase difference for matter waves is 4AmΩ/h. Since υ= mc2/h, it agrees with the formula  
for the optical Sagnac effect. However, the matter-wave interferometer is more sensitive 
to rotation by the factor c/v, and in the non-relativistic limit, the Sagnac phase shift of 
matter waves is independent of the wavelength.  

Since rate of a clock in the gravitational field changes, the clock located in the 

balloons/satellite could experience the shift relative to a clock located on the earth. Singer 
originally suggested the digital method to test the general theory of relativity by 
measuring gravitational red shift of the satellite clocks [7].

Conclusion 

We came to the highly probable conclusion that fundamental fields are the wave 

disturbances in certain dispersive medium that defines the preferred reference frame. 
Originally, the quantum theory and relativity began with the study of blackbody radiation 
and anisotropy of velocity of electromagnetic waves. When the quantum hypothesis leads 
to excellent agreement with the experiment, the most debated problem in space-time 
physics is disparity between the Michelson and Sagnac experiments. Also, it is difficult 
to dismiss the concept of absolute space, where there is inertia.

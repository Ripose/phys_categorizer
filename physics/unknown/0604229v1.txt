Abstract 

Treatments of Fraunhofer diffraction normally approximate the inclination factor 
in  the  diffraction  integral  by  1,  but  this  is  not  necessary.  In  this  paper,  the 
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  diffraction  integral  is  used  and  a  complete  description  of 
Fraunhofer  diffraction  is  given,  with  the  minimum  possible  number  of 
approximations made. A focused wave is examined before, at, and after its focal 
point to elucidate the exact role of the Fourier transform in describing Fraunhofer 
diffraction and to derive the Guoy phase shift.  
 

1. Introduction 

 
Fraunhofer  diffraction  is  fundamental  to  any  introductory  college-level  optics  course  and 
should be taught with as much precision and as few approximations as possible. The archetypical 
treatment  of  Fraunhofer  diffraction  is  that  of  Born  and  Wolf[1],  which  starts  with  the  Fresnel-
Kirchhoff  (FK)  diffraction  integral  and  must  therefore  approximate  the  inclination  factor  (also 
called  the  obliquity  factor)  by  1  before  proceeding  to  the  Fraunhofer  analysis.  Without  this 
approximation,  analytic  progress  cannot  be  made.  Another  popular  treatment  is  that  of 
Goodman[2],  which  makes  additional  approximations  (see  below).  But  if  we  begin  with  the 
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) diffraction integral, it is not necessary to approximate the inclination 
factor  by  1.  In  a  recent  paper[3],  I  showed  the  superiority  of  RS  over  FK  for  providing  an 
accurate description of Poisson’s spot. (The two integrals use different inclination factors, but are 
otherwise  the  same.)  I  now  use  the  RS  diffraction  integral  to  give  the  most  accurate  possible 
description  of  Fraunhofer  diffraction.  Once  this  is  done,  the  approximations  of  Born  and  Wolf 
and of Goodman can be made, as needed or desired, with a full understanding of their accuracy 
and consequences.  
  With reference to Figure 1 (next page), Fraunhofer diffraction describes both (1) the far-field 
diffraction pattern of a small source and (2) the focal plane illumination pattern of a converging 
wave.  These  may  be  referred  to  as  the  forward  and  inverse  Fraunhofer problems,  respectively. 
After setting the inclination factor to 1, Born and Wolf do the forward problem and show that the 
Fourier transform relation between the source wave front and the calculated wave front is from 
Cartesian coordinates to direction cosines, but they derive the inverse problem from the forward 
problem in a way that obscures the fact that the Fourier transform relation in the inverse problem 
is from direction cosines to Cartesian coordinates. Goodman also sets the inclination factor to 1, 
then uses an approximation that causes the Fourier transform relation to be between two sets of 
Cartesian coordinates. The Born and Wolf treatment is also subject to the mild criticism that it 
doesn’t keep track of the overall phase factor of –i outside the Fraunhofer integral.

This  paper  keeps  the  inclination  factor  in  the  calculation  and  does  the  forward  and  inverse 
problems separately to obtain the more accurate results that, in case (1), the diffraction pattern is 
proportional  to  the  Fourier  transform  of  the  source  wave  front  multiplied  by  the  inclination 
factor,  while,  in  case  (2),  the  source  wave  front  is  divided  by  the  inclination  factor  before  the 
Fourier transform is applied. Also, this paper combines the two problems to show the relation of 
an after-focus wave front to a before-focus wave front, a relation that includes the Guoy phase 
shift. By this means, the Guoy phase shift can be derived from Fraunhofer diffraction.  
 
Sec.  2  treats  the  basic  Fraunhofer  diffraction  problem  of  a  wave  diverging  from  a  small 
source. Sec. 3 treats the inverse problem of a wave converging on a focal point and exhibits the 
converging  wave  that  results  in  the  traditional  Airy-disc  diffraction  pattern  (it  has  a  cosθ 
amplitude dependence), and Sec. 4 combines the two to show what happens when a wave passes 
through a focal point.

Figure 1. A wave converging from the left is brought to a focus in the z = 0 plane, 
then diverges to the right. z and z- are sufficiently far from the focal plane to assure 
that the conditions of Fraunhofer diffraction are  met for both processes. The  right 
side  of  the  figure  illustrates  waves  diverging  from  a  small  source,  as  described  in 
Sec. 2, the left side shows converging waves, as described in Sec. 3. Both sides are 
used in Sec. 4. The planes at z and z- both use (x, y) coordinates (the +y axis points 
out of the page), a fact that will not confuse the alert reader. On the right side of the 
figure, angle θ is defined by tanθ = (x2 + y2)½/z, on the left by tanθ = (x2 + y2)½/(-z-) 
so that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 always; again this will cause no confusion. The vectors of length 
l point from an arbitrary point in the source wave front to an arbitrary point in the 
calculated wave front. In both cases the angle θ' is the angle between this vector and 
the +z direction.

2. The Forward Fraunhofer Problem: A Wave Diverging from a Small Source 

  We begin with the standard Fraunhofer problem of calculating the far-field diffraction pattern 
of a light wave diverging from a small source. This is illustrated on the right side of Figure 1 for 
light  diverging  from  a  focal  plane,  but  the  derivation  is  valid  for  any  small  diffractive  source, 
such as an aperture illuminated by a plane wave. The RS diffraction integral[2,3] for this case is

In the argument of the exponential function in Eq. (1), any error in approximating l must be 
small compared to λ in order to give an accurate result for the integral. To see this, we need only 
observe  that  exp[ik(l  +  δl)]  =  exp(ikl)×exp(ikδl)  and  that  exp(ikδl)  ≈  1  +  i2πδl/λ  for  small  δl. 
Defining  a2  as  the  maximum  value  of  x'2  +  y'2,  it  follows  that  a2/2r  is  the  maximum  possible 
value  of  the  lowest-order  neglected  term  in  Eq.  (2).  Therefore,  the  approximation  preserves 
phase as long as δl = a2/2r << λ/2π or  

  Outside the exponential, l appears only as the multiplicative factor l -2. To illustrate the effect 
of an approximation in this factor, we set y = 0, use x/r < 1, x' ≤ a, and a2/2r << λ/2π to see from 
Eqs. (2) and (3) that

which shows that the ratio l/r can be made as close to 1 as desired, i.e., we may set l ≈ r, if r is 
big  enough.  Specifically,  if,  say,  r  >  104λ,  then  l  differs  from  r  by  less  than  1%.  For  large  r, 
therefore, only the first term in the approximation in Eq. (2) need be used when l appears outside 
the exponential.

where (using Goodman’s notation) A0 is the Fourier transform of U(x', y', 0), x/r = sinθcosφ and 
y/r  =  sinθsinφ  have  been  used,  and  the  last  form  is  given  to  emphasize  that  in  the  Fraunhofer 
regime,  A0  is  a  function  only  of  direction,  not  of  distance.  In  Eq.  (5),  most  of  the  phase 
information about U(x, y, z) is contained in the exp(ikr) factor, which describes a spherical phase 
front. But this phase front can be modified by A0: in directions (θ, φ) where A0 is negative phase 
is reversed, and if A0 is a complex function phase can change (usually slowly!) with direction. In 
either case, phase fronts are no longer strictly spherical. 
 
The  quantities  x/r  and  y/r  are  direction  cosines[1,2].  Observe  that  the  Fourier  transform  in 
Eq. (5) is between the coordinate sets (x', y') and (x, y)/λr, i.e., between the Cartesian coordinates 
of the source wave front and the direction cosines, with λ acting as a scale factor for the latter: 
for the same source size, longer wavelengths diffract into a larger range of direction cosines, i.e., 
into larger angles. Eq. (5) shows that the Fourier-transformed quantity is the source wave front, 
as expected, but that the amplitude of the resulting wave is proportional to this Fourier transform 
multiplied by cosθ, not just the Fourier transform itself.  
 
The effect of the approximations made in other treatments of Fraunhofer diffraction can be 
seen by inspection of Eq. (5). First and most obvious, all other treatments known to this writer 
approximate the inclination factor by 1, which means that the cosθ factor does not appear. (The 
interested student is invited to repeat the above calculation and that of the next section with the 
RS  inclination  factor  replaced  by  the  FK  inclination  factor.)  To  be  sure,  this  improvement  in 
accuracy is very small for the values of θ usually encountered in optical diffraction problems, but 
see Lucke[3], where Poisson’s spot is presented as a counterexample.  
 
Second, with reference to the second line of Eq. (5), Goodman[2], in his Eq. (4-13) on p. 61, 
uses  the  parabolic-wave  approximation  (so-called  because  it  implies  a  parabolic  rather  than  a 
spherical wave front),  that is, he  uses r  ≈  z  +  (x2  + y2)/2z in the exponent outside the integral. 
This  expansion  neglects  the  next  higher  term,  which  is  –(x2  +  y2)2/8z3,  and  can  lead  to  large 
errors  in  describing  phase.  To  see  this,  we  set  y  =  0,  write  θ  ≈  x/z,  and  set  the  value  of  the 
neglected term to one-half wavelength: x4/8z3 ≈ zθ4/8 = λ/2. Solving this equation for z yields z = 
4λ/θ4, which shows that when θ ≠ 0 there is a distance z at which the phase error becomes large. 
When θ = 2° ≈ 0.035 rad, this happens for z ≈ 2.7×106λ, between one and two meters for optical 

4 

wavelengths. There are many problems in optics for which this phase error is not important, but 
those who use the parabolic-wave approximation should be aware of it.  
 
Third,  Goodman  uses  the  approximation  1/r  ≈  1/z,  both  outside  the  integral  and  in  the 
exponent inside the integral. This means that the 1/r dependence of amplitude on distance in Eq, 
(5) becomes 1/z dependence, which affects only amplitude and is quite accurate as long as θ is 
small.  Since  x/z  =  tanθcosφ  and  y/z  =  tanθsinφ,  it  also  means  that  tanθ  replaces  sinθ  in  the 
argument of the Fourier transform, which slightly changes the direction in which features of the 
diffraction pattern appear.  
 
3. The Inverse Fraunhofer Problem: A Wave Converging to a Focus 

  With  reference  to  the  left  side  of  Fig.  1,  we  start  with  a  wave  front  with  arbitrary  angular 
dependence converging from the left on a focal point, and use Eq. (1) to find the amplitude in the 
focal plane. In this case, cosθ' = (-z-)/l, and the integral is over (x, y). The initial wave front is 
described by U(x, y, z-) = U0f(θ, φ)exp(-ikr)/r, where the minus sign in the exponent describes a 
wave traveling to the right (because, when z < 0, r decreases with time rather than increasing). 
The RS diffraction integral is:

where exactly the same approximations have been made in the last line of Eq. (6) as were made 
in  Eqs.  (2)  and  (5):  the  (x'2  +  y'2)/2r  term  in  Eq.  (2)  makes  a  negligibly  small  contribution  to 
phase  if  z-  is  big  enough  (the  fact  that  x'  and  y'  are  no  longer  the  variables  of  integration  is 
irrelevant), and l ≈ r outside the exponent so that cosθ' = (-z-)/l ≈ (-z-)/r = cosθ.  
 
The integration is now over (x, y), so it isn’t obvious that Eq. (6) is a Fourier transform of the 
function  f(θ,  φ)/cosθ.  In  fact,  it  is  not  a  Fourier  transform  over  the  variables  (x,  y),  but  it  is  a 
Fourier transform over the direction cosines, that is, over the variables (x/r, y/r). To show this, 
we make the substitutions u = x/r, v = y/r. Observe that -1 ≤ u, v ≤ 1 and that u2 + v2 ≤ 1. Now 
∂u/∂x = (r2 – x2)/r3, etc., so

Eq.  (8)  has  the  form  of  a  Fourier  transform,  although  the  purist  may  want  to  extend  the 
 
integration limits to ± ∞. This is easily accomplished by observing that, since u = x/r = sinθcosφ 
and v = y/r = sinθsinφ, it follows that sinθ = (u2 + v2)½ and tanφ = v/u, and these equations can be 
inverted  to  give  θ(u,  v)  and  φ(u,  v).  We  now  define  a  new  function  g(u,  v)  =  f[θ(u,  v),  φ(u, 
v)]/cosθ(u, v) for u2 + v2 ≤ 1, g(u, v) = 0 otherwise, to extend the integration limits to ± ∞. Thus 
the  assertion  that  the  Fourier-transformed  quantity  is  the  source  wave  front  divided  by  cosθ  is 
proved. 
Eq. (5) is a Fourier transform from Cartesian coordinates to direction cosines, while Eq. (8) is 
 
from direction cosines to Cartesian coordinates. But one is not the inverse of the other: both are 
forward Fourier transforms. This point will be revisited in Sec. 4.  
The interested reader may easily verify that if both the approximations cosθ ≈ 1 and 1/r ≈ 1/z 
 
are made in the last line of Eq. (6), then the substitutions u = x/z, v = y/z give Eq. (8) without the 
1/cosθ  factor  in  the  integrand.  This  is  the  approximation  used  by  Goodman[2]  for  the  inverse 
Fraunhofer problem [see his Eq. (5-45) with ,x y(cid:4) (cid:4)  taken from Eq. (5-35), but note that these are 
Cartesian coordinates, not direction cosines]. Observe that if the converging wave is formed by 
an optical system with an f-number of 1, then the maximum value of θ is 26° and that cos26° ≈ 
0.9, which can be expected to make a noticeable, though not large, difference in the value of the 
integral in Eq. (8).  
 
For the special case of a circularly symmetric wave front, Eq. (6) can be reduced to a one-
dimensional integral. In this case, f(θ, φ) = f(θ) and the symmetry of the problem says that we 
can set y' = 0 and x' = ρ', where ρ' is the radial coordinate in the focal plane. We now use dxdy = 
ρdφdρ,  where  ρ  is  the  radial  coordinate  in  the  (x,  y)  plane,  ρ  =  ztanθ,  dρ/dθ  =  z/cos2θ,  x  = 
rsinθcosφ,  and  r  =  z/cosθ  so  that  cos2θdxdy/r2  =  cosθsinθdθdφ  =  sinθd(sinθ)dφ.  Using  the 
definition of the J0 Bessel function, Eq. (6) becomes

where the substitution u = sinθ has been made. {With reference to the first equation on p. 248 of 
Bracewell[5], Eq. (9) can be seen to have the form of the 2D Fourier transform of f(θ)/cosθ, a 
statement that will not be dwelt on here because it is shown in general in Eq. (8).}  
  A converging wave front with a convergence half-angle of θ0 and cosθ angular dependence 
is described by U(x, y, z-) = U0cosθR(θ/θ0)exp(-ikr)/r, where R is the rectangle function, R(u) = 1 
for |u| ≤ 1, R(u) = 0 for |u| > 1. Putting f(θ) = cosθR(θ/θ0) in Eq. (9), we find, substituting v = 
kρ'u and using the Bessel function relation given in Eq. (11) on p. 395 of Born & Wolf[1], that

which shows the desired result: it takes an initial amplitude dependence of cosθ to produce the 
familiar Airy-disk diffraction pattern. The standard problem of a constant-amplitude wave, when 
done with the precision used here, does not have a closed-form solution.  
 
4. The Relation Between Before-Focus and After-Focus Wave Fronts 

  We now put U(ρ', 0) from Eq. (10) in place of U(x', y', 0) in the second line of Eq. (5) to find 
the amplitude on the far side of focus for the process shown in Fig. 1:

where the integral, being the 2D Fourier transform of a circularly symmetric function, is taken 
from  the  first  entry  in  Table  12.2  on  p.  249  of  Bracewell[5],  with  R(u)  used  in  place  of 
Bracewell’s Π(u) (which = 0 for |u| > ½). The relations sinθ = (x2 + y2)½/r and R(sinθ/sinθ0) = 
R(θ/θ0) have also been used.  
Thus  we  see  that  an  initial  wave  front  given  by  U0cosθR(θ/θ0)exp(-ikr)/r,  after  passing 
 
through focus, becomes -U0cosθR(θ/θ0)exp(ikr)/r. The overall minus sign is the product of two 
factors of –i, each one of which denotes a phase loss of one-quarter cycle. Thus, compared to a 
plane wave traveling the distance from z- to z, the wave passing through focus has lost one-half 
cycle.  This  is  the  Gouy  phase  shift.  A  detailed  description  of  the  Gouy  shift  lies  outside 
Fraunhofer  diffraction  (see,  for  example,  p.  448  of  Born  and  Wolf[1]).  Observe  that  the  Gouy 
shift is independent of the inclination factor, i.e., of whether the RS or FK diffraction integral is 
used. 
The  relation  between  the  before-focus  wave  and  the  after-focus  wave  is  easy  to  generalize 
 
from the specific case considered above because the after-focus wave is found by twice applying 
a  forward  Fourier  transform  to  the  before-focus  wave.  The  reader  is  reminded  that  the  double 
forward transform of f(x) is f(-x), so, using the function g(u, v) of Sec. 3, passing through focus 
changes g(u, v) to g(-u, -v) or f [θ(u, v), φ(u, v)] to f [θ(-u, -v), φ(-u, -v)]. Now, sinθ = (u2 + v2)½ 
and tanφ = v/u, so only φ is affected by sign changes of u and v. Inverting the tangent function 
requires taking the signs of u and v into account: if tan-1(v/u) = φ then tan-1[(-v)/(-u)] = φ + π. 
Thus, if Eq. (11) were reproduced for an arbitrary angular dependence of the original converging 
wave, i.e., for f(θ, φ) instead of f(θ) = cosθR(θ/θ0), the result would be -U0f(θ, φ+π)exp(ikr)/r. 
Physically, this says that the wave front after focus is the same as the wave front before focus,

but rotated 180° about the z axis, or, equivalently, inverted through the origin of the (x, y) plane, 
and with the Gouy phase shift applied.  
 
5. Conclusion 

  By using the RS diffraction integral, keeping r (instead of approximating it) in Eqs. (5) and 
(6), and carefully considering the approximations that are made, this paper presents a complete 
description  of  Fraunhofer  diffraction,  in  which  only  the  Fraunhofer  approximation  has  been 
made. The principal difference between the results presented here, given in Eqs. (5) and (8), and 
those  of  conventional  treatments  is  that  they  contain  the  inclination  factor,  cosθ.  In  the 
overwhelming  majority  of  optics  problems,  this  factor  can  be  safely  approximated  by  1,  but 
Lucke[3]  shows  that  describing  Poisson’s  spot  is  an  outstanding  counterexample,  and  it  is 
pointed  out  in  Sec.  3  of  this  paper  that  cosθ  ≈  1  becomes  problematic  in  the  case  of  a  focus 
formed  at  a  low  f-number.  Also,  Eq.  (8)  is  a  Fourier  transform  from  direction  cosines  to 
Cartesian coordinates, a form that is familiar to radio astronomers[4] (though it appears there in a 
different imaging context), but not to most optics workers.  
 
The  exact  nature  of  the  Fourier  transform  relation  between  the  source  and  calculated  wave 
fronts has been demonstrated for both the forward and inverse Fraunhofer problems, and the two 
problems combined to shown how the Gouy phase shift appears in Fraunhofer diffraction. It has 
been shown that a constant-amplitude converging wave front passing through a circular aperture 
does  not  produce  exactly  the  well-known  Airy  pattern,  though  the  difference  is  small  for  the 
values of θ normally encountered in optical problems.

1.  Introduction 

   In  the  last  century  several  major  inventions  in  the  field  of  gaseous  detectors 
were made. Let us just mention the Geiger counter [1], parallel plate detectors 
[2] and multiwire proportional chambers (MWPC) [3]. The main feature of all 
of  these  detectors  is  that  they  exploit  gas  multiplication  or  Townsend 
avalanches.  One  of  the  most  successful  developments  was  the  MWPC  which 
combined  the  gas  multiplication  feature  with  a  position  resolution  (typically 
0.1x2 mm). The inventor of this detector -G. Charpak -was awarded the Nobel 
Price in 1992. Parallel to these main developments there have always been many 
small- scale efforts in the development of high granularity gaseous detectors or, 
to  be  more  precise,  gaseous  detectors  with  small  distances  between  the  anode 
and the cathode electrodes. For example, very small single wire detectors were 
developed for medical applications [4], an  array of wire detectors was used for 
cosmic applications [5], small gap multiwire detectors were also developed for 
plasma diagnostics (see for example [6,7]. Such detectors may potentially offer 
high  2D  position  resolutions.  However,  the  manufacturing  techniques  of  such 
detectors were very difficult and they did not receive great attention.  
A  real  breakthrough  in  this  direction  was  made  by  A.  Oed  who  suggested  the 
use  of  microelectronic  techniques  for  the  manufacturing  of  gaseous  detectors 
which makes the manufacturing a lot easier [8]. This triggered a chain of other 
inventions:  microgap  [9],  MICROMEGAS  [10]  and  GEM  [11]  to  name  a  few 
(see  below  for  more  details)  .  Now  all  of  these  new  detectors  are  called  -
micropattern gaseous detectors. As one can see from the following chapters, it is 
quite  a  wide  class  of  detectors:  from  strips,  to dots, to hole -type structures. It 
will thus be useful to introduce a definition for micropattern detectors: they are 
high granularity gaseous detectors with small (below 1 mm) distances between 
the anode and the cathode electrodes.

the  micropattern  detectors  are 

The  main  advantages  of 
that:  new 
(microelectronics)  technology  was  applied  for  their  manufacturing  and  they 
have  high  “granularity”,  thus  offering  potentials  for  very  high  position 
resolutions.  Moreover,  due  to  this  feature  (small  distance  between  the 
electrodes)  they  may  have  high  time  resolutions  and  good  counting  rate 
capabilities. 
The  aim  of  this  report  is  to  review  the  main  achievements  in  this  field  and 
identify  any  possible  future  progress  whilst  describing  new  and  current 
applications. 
 

2.  Main Directions in the Design of Micropattern Gaseous  Detectors  

    More than 20 various designs of micropattern detectors are known. Most of 
them  are  already  described  in  several  review  papers  [12,13]  so  to  avoid 
repetition we will just mention the main designs and then focus our attention on 
the description of the main tendencies in  the developments.  
 
2.1 Microstrip (Microwire)  –Type of Gaseous Detectors 
 
    A classical example of a microstrip detector is one invented by A. Oed [8]. It 
is  an  alternative  cathode  and  anode  strips  structure  (typical  pitch  of  200-  400 
µm)  deposit  by  a  lithographic  method  on  a  dielectric  supporting  structure  (see 
Fig. 1). The small thickness of the anode strips (7-20 µm) ensures the formation 
of  a  high  electric  field  in  its  vicinity.  Primary  electrons  created  by  external 
radiation in the volume between the drift electrode and the anode-cathode plane 
(typically the thickness of this gap is  L= 3-30 mm) drift toward the anode strips 
and trigger Townsend avalanches. Typical gains which could be achieved were 
around  104.  There  are  several  variations  of  this  main  design  however,  for 
example the  microgap gas counters [9] and the WELL detector [14].   
In  most  cases  there  are  2D  multiplication  structures  but  recently  3D  “strip”  or 
“microwire” structures were developed as well [15]. 
 
2.2 Microdot (Micropin) –Type Detectors 
 
    A basic microdot detector is a periodic structure of coaxial cathode and anode 
rings  deposited  by  lithographic  technology  on  a  dielectric  substrate-see  Fig.  2 
[16, 17].

Typical  diameters  of  the  cathode  and  the  anode  rings  are  200  and  20  µm  
respectively. As in the previous detector, the absorption of the radiation occurs 
in  the  gas  volume  between  the  drifting  electrode  and  the  anode-cathode 
electrode’s plane (L=3-30 mm). Due to the small diameter of the anode dots the 
electric field lines are focused in their vicinity. Primary electrons created in the 
drift  volume  by  the  external  radiation  drift  toward  the  anode  dots  and  initiate 
Townsend avalanches. Typical gains of microdot detectors are 104, however in 
some optimised gas mixtures gains of up to 105 were possible to achieve.  
There  are  several  variations  to  this  basic  design.  Recently,  3D  versions  of 
microdot  detectors  were  developed  by  several  groups  [19,20].  This  detector, 
which in fact is resembling an array of micro single-wire counters (see [6]) , had 

4 

 

invertors  expectations  that  very  high  gains,  typical  for  single  wire  detectors, 
would be achieved [21], however, with the present designs gains of only  ~104 
were possible to reach. 
 
 
2.3 Hole –Type Detectors 
 
   Typically, the hole –type structure is a  metallized from both sides dielectric 
sheet (typically 0.05-2 mm thick) with holes (0.1-2 mm in diameter). If a high 
voltage is applied to the metallic electrodes then each individual hole works as 
an electrostatic lance focusing field lines. This allows a high electric field inside 
the  holes  to  be  formed.  Primary  electrons  created  by  external  radiation  in  the 
drift  region  (the  space  between  the  drift  electrode  and  the  hole-type 
multiplication  structure)  drift  to  the  holes  and  trigger  Townsend  avalanches  in 
that area.  
   Most likely  the first authors who demonstrated that  some gain is possible to 
achieve inside the glass capillaries (with inner diameters of 0.1-5 mm) were A. 
Del Guerra et al [22]. However, this idea recently gained a new momentum after 
the suggestions of several authors in using micro-holes [23, 24] and “trench” –
type  structures  [25].  The  most  popular  one  today  is  a  so  called  Gas  Electron 
Multiplier  (GEM),  developed  by  F.  Sauli  [11].  It  is  a  metallized  (from  both 
sides) kapton sheet  (50 µm thick) with holes of 100 µm in diameter and a pitch 
of 140 µm-see Fig. 3. GEM has several important advantages over other hole –
type  detectors:  kapton  is  low  in  mass  and  is  flexible  as  a  material  and  such  a 
detector  is  easy  to  manufacture  for  a  low  price.  Gains  of  104  are  possible  to 
achieve  with  this  detector.  However  nowadays  in  most  applications,  stacks  of 
GEMs are usually used (like in traditional multistep avalanche chambers [26]). 
Such a multistep detector contains several GEMs placed 0.5-3 mm above each 
other. Voltages over each GEM and between the GEMs are set in a such a way 
that part of the multiplied charge in the holes

could be extracted from the holes and directed to another GEM; so that cascade 
multiplication  occurs  (see  [27]  for  more  details).  This  allows  the  overall 
maximum gain to be boosted up to 106. 
  
 
2.4 Parallel-Plate Type Detectors 
 
A  “classical”  example  of  a  parallel  plate  -type  micropattern  detectors  is  a  so 
called Micro Mesh Gas Detector (MICROMEGAS) [10]. The main element in 
this detector is the micromesh (4-29 µm in wire’s pitch) stretched 50- 100 µm 
above  the  readout  plate  (usually  a  G10  plate  with  metallic  strips  of  a  300  µm 
pitch).  A  voltage  of  400-700  V  is  applied  between  the  mesh  and  the  readout 
plate. The primary electrons created in the drift space (L=3-30mm) move toward 
the  micromesh,  drift  through  the  mesh  openings  and  then  experience 
multiplication in the gap between the mesh and the readout plate. Typical gains 
are ~105 (at low counting rates - see paragraph 7). One can see that this detector 
is  similar  to  parallel-mesh  detectors  widely  used  previously  (see  for  example 
[28]). However, the revolutional step was that the gap between the mesh and the 
anode plate was reduced by almost two orders of magnitude. 
  This  idea  of  a  microgap  parallel-  plate  detector  triggered  a  chain  of  other 
inventions.  One  of  them  are  the  microgap  Resistive  Plate  Chambers  (RPCs), 
which  immediately  began  to  be  used  in  practice.  There  are  two  main 
developments  in  this  direction:  a  “timing  RPC”  [29]  and  a  high  position 
resolution  RPC  [30,  31].  “Timing”  RPCs  are  parallel  plate  detectors  with  the 
metallic  cathodes  and  anodes  made  of  medium  resistivity  (ρ~109-1011  Ωcm) 

glass. The gap between the cathode and the anode is typically 100-400 µm [29]. 
The  small  gap  allows  one  to  achieve  a  very  high  time  resolution,  ~50  ps  [29, 
30].  The  main  applications  today  for  this  RPC  are  time  of  flight  detectors  for 
high-energy physic and PET [30-32]. 
High  position  resolution  RPCs  have  a  slightly  different  design:  their  cathodes 
are mode of low resitivity (ρ~104-108 Ωcm) materials (Si, GaAs) and the anodes 
–from medium resistivity glasses with metallic strips of 50 µm pitch-see Fig.4.

The gap between the anode and the cathode is about 100-400 µm. This allows 
one  to  achieve  an  excellent  position  resolution-  better  than  50  µm  in  digital 
mode [30]. It is remarkable that such RPCs can operate almost at the same gas 
gains and counting rates as metallic parallel plate avalanche chambers (PPACs) 
[30]. But in contrast to the metallic PPAC they are spark protected and thus very 
reliable  in  exploitation.  This  is  why  these  detectors  almost  immediately  after 
their development began to be used for medical imaging applications [33]. 
Recently,  a  microgap  detector  design  combining  both  ideas  (MICROMEGAS 
and  microgap  RPCs)  has  been  reported  [34].  It  has  a  mesh  cathode  and  a 
medium resistivity anode placed 100 µm below the mesh. The main advantages 
of this detector are that it is spark- protected and has a traditional drift volume 
(actually  this  design  is  similar  to  one  the  described  in  [35],  but  with  a  much 
smaller gap between the cathode´s mesh and the anode plate). 
 

3. 

 Signal Readout Techniques 

 
There  are  two  main  techniques  for  signal readout from micropattern detectors: 
the  use  of  the  induced  charge  from  the  metallic  readout  strips  or  pads  is  one 
technique, and the use of the light emission produced by Townsend avalanches 

 

7 

is  another.  In  the  case  of  the  microstrip  detectors  (see  Fig.  1),  the  charge  -
sensitive amplifiers are usually directly connected to the anode or the cathodes 
strips. In addition, induced signals from the backside of the dielectric supporting 
plane  are  used  quite  often.  The  readout  strips  on  the  back  plane  are  usually 
oriented perpendicularly to the anode and the cathode strips. This allows one to 
obtain 2D images of the detected events.  
 In  the  case  of  the  hole-  type  detector  a  readout  plate  is  usually  placed  ~1mm 
below the detector. To obtain 2D images either a system of strips isolated from 
each  other  and  oriented  perpendicular  to  each  other  or  pads  are  used  [12,36]. 
Recently, very promising results were obtained with a so-called  “active pixel” 
readout – an amorphous silicon thin-film transistors array [37].  
   In the case of the parallel-plate micropattern detectors, the anode plate serves 
as  a  readout  plate  simultaniously.  The  anode  plate  may  have  metallic  readout 
strips both in the inner and outer surfaces. 
  The optical readout of gaseous detectors with a TV tube or a CCD camera has 
been  used  for  a  long  time  now  [38,  39].  However,  the  application  of  it  to  the 
micropattern detectors gave a new momentum to this technique, allowing one to 
obtain impressive images of various objects or particle’s tracks [40, 41, 42]. 
 
4.    Efforts in the Optimization of the  Micropattern Detector’s Design 
 
   As  one  can  see  from  a  short  review  presented  above,  most  micropattern 
gaseous  detectors  have  maximum  achievable  gains  of  Amax=104-105.  Note  that 
this is 10-100 times less than is possible to reach with usual gaseous detectors, 
wire or parallel-plate type. However, even these relatively moderate gains were 
achieved  after  careful  studies  by  many  authors  on  the  detector’s  design 
optimisation  [43-46].  Thus  one  can  consider  today  gains  of  104-105  as  the 
maximum  that  can  be  achieved  for  micropattern  gaseous  detectors.  The 
discussion for the reasons of these limits is given in paragraph 7.  
 
5.  Main Tendencies in the Developments Today 
 
   One  can  identify  two  very  natural  directions  in  the  development  of  
micropattern  gaseous  detectors  today:  1)  inventions  of  new  designs  and 
technology  for  their  manufacturing,  2)  improvement  of  their  reliability  in  the 
existing devices.  
   Main tendencies in the development of new designs are: attempts to reach the 
highest possible granularity (or the smallest possible distance between the anode 
and  cathode  structures)  [9,23,  47],  attempts  to  restrict  the  released  energy  in 
case  of  occasional  discharges  by  using  for  example,  resistive  materials  for 

8 

 

electrodes  [33]  and  developing  3D  multiplication  structures  (see  for  example 
[15,20]). 
   The  main  tendencies  in  improving  the  existing  devices  are:  an  attempt  to 
increase the maxim achievable gain and attempts to make their operation more 
reliable by avoiding discharges or making them less harmful [33,49]. 
   The  limit  in  maximum  achievable  gain  mentioned  in  the  previous  section 
creates  serious  problems  in  real  applications.  Indeed,  gains  of  104-105  are  the 
maximum that can be achieved. In the presence of heavily ionized particles or at 
high enough counting rate the maximum achievable gain further drops. Thus to 
guard the detector from possible destructive sparks, one has to operate at gains 
of only ~103.  
   There are two ways to overcome this limit: either operating at gains close to 
the  Amax,  but  insuring  at  the  same  time    that  discharges,  if  they  appear,  are 
harmless  or  by    using    micropattern  detectors  in  combination  with  some  
preamplification structure.  
   The  first  approach  is  more  appropriate  for  parallel  plate  type  micropattern 
detectors  because  they  have  the  highest  value  of  Amax  compared  to  other 
micropattern  detectors  [49,50,43].  To  protect  this  type  of  detector  against 
destructive sparks either resistors are used connected to each individual readout 
strip  (as  was  in  the  case  with  MICROMEGAS  [49]),  or  their  electrodes  are 
made  of  resistive  materials  (as  was  in  the  case  with  the  microgap  RPCs  [30]). 
This  allows  the  operation  at  gains  close  to  105  to  be  at  low  (<10  Hz/mm2) 
counting  rates.  As  was  mentioned  before,  at  higher  counting  rates  or  in  the 
presence of heavily ionized particles, the maximum achievable gain drops (see 
[50] for more details). 
   The  second  approach  is  now  mostly  used  for  all  other  types  of  micropattern 
detectors,  for  example  in  microstrip  or  hole  -type.  As  a  preamplification 
structure either a parallel mesh detector [52], GEM [53], or a capillary plate [54] 
can be used. The exact type of preamplifiaction structure is dictated by practical 
requirements  only.  From  the  point  of  view  of  physics  they  are  all  equal.  The 
main  idea  in  the  use  of  the  preamplification  structure  is  to  reduce  the  gain  in 
each multiplication stage. The reason why this allows one to reach overall high 
gains will be discussed in paragraph 7.   
 
6.   How Far Can We Go? 
 
As was mentioned above, one of the tendencies in the development of 
micropattern gaseous detectors is the attempt to achieve the highest possible 
granularity (or the smallest possible distance ∆ between the anode’s and 

 

9 

cathode’s electrodes). “Micro”-micropattern detectors with ∆ ~ 1.5 µm were 
already tested, some were successful [23, 48] -  Fig. 5,6.  
 

 
Fig. 5. Electrode structure based on a flat screen display [23]. 
 

 

 

 
Fig. 6. The concept of the “Spind “ctathode detector [48]. 
 
   One can ask the natural question: what sets the limit in these developments? 
Can we further decrease ∆ and use for example, nanostructures?  
   Obviously for the moment there is no limit on the manufacturing technology 
of such structures. The limit is actually set by the working media- by gas in the 
given  case.  Experiments  show  that  the  maximum achievable gain for “micro”-
micropattern  detectors  was  small,  ~30.  The  other  concept  associated  with  this 

10 

 

problem  is  that  any  breakdown  may  easily  destroy  this  fragile  electrode 
structure. Only one discharge could be fatal; so the reliability of such detectors 
could be questionable. 
   Finally,  can  one  really  benefit  in  practice  from  very  high  granularity?  Note 
that in many cases the range of delta electrons or photoelectrons is much larger 
than a few µm [55], so do we need such a high granularity or segmentation?  
   In the next chapter we will discuss what factors limit the maximum achievable 
gain and the rate characteristics of micropattern detectors, as well as what size 
the gap between the electrodes should be in order to be  sufficient in practice. 
 
7. Gain Limit 
7.1 Low Rate 
 
   There are at least two main phenomenas contributing to the gain limit ( A max 
at  which  breakdowns  appears)  of  micropattern  gaseous  detectors  at  low 
counting rates: 
1. Streamers in gas volume and 
2. Streamers across the dielectric surfaces. 
   Historically,  systematic  studies  of  streamers  in  gas  were  done  by  Raether  in 
large  gap  (>3  mm)  parallel  plate  avalanche  chambers.  He  experimentally 
established  that  in  this  detector’s  geometry  streamers  might  appear  when  the 
total charge in the avalanche exceeds some critical value [2]: 
 Amaxn0 ≥ Qmax ~108 electrons  (1), 
where n0  is the number of primary electrons created by the radiation in the gas. 
Note  that  the  maximum  achievable  gain  Amax  is  inversely  proportional  to  n0. 
Thus for 6 keV X-rays (n0~200 electrons) the breakdown will appear at gains of 
106, whereas for alpha particles (n0~105) the maximum achievable gain will be 
Amax ~103. 
   The  value  of  Qmax  at  ~108  electrons  is  often  called  the  “Raether“  limit.  The 
physic  behind  this  is  that  at  Amaxn0~Qmax  the  space  charge  in  the  avalanche 
becomes  sufficient  to  disturb  the  external  electric  filed.  As  a  result, 
photoelectrons  created  by  avalanches  in  the  surrounding  gas  volume  begin  to 
drift  toward  the  positive  ions  remaining  from  the  initial  avalanche  and  finally 
forming a thin plasma filament, called a streamer –see Fig. 7 and [2, 56].  
 

 

11 

 

 
Fig. 7. Schematic drawing of streamer developments [56]. 
 
Note that the streamer causes breakdown when its head reaches the cathode. In 
the  case  of  an  almost  uniform  external  electric  field  all  streamers  reach  the 
cathode. However, if the field strength drops quickly with the distance from the 
anode’s  electrode,  the  streamer’s  propagation  may  stop  in  the  gas  volume 
without  reaching  the  cathode  [56].  These  “self-quenched”  streamers  do  not 
cause any harmful breakdowns.  
What is described here is correct for usual gaseous detectors (parallel plate- type 
or  wire-  type  detectors  with  thick  anode  wires).  It  was  recently  found  [50,56] 
that  in  most  micropattern  gaseous  detectors  breakdowns  also  appear  at  some 
critical charge in avalanche : 
Amaxn0 ≥ qmax      (2), 
where  q  max  is  some  critical  value  (qmax<Qmax)  which  depends  on  the 
micropattern detector’s geometry and the n0 (see [56]). For example, in the case 
of parallel plate geometries it linearly increases with the thickness of the gap d:  
qmax~kd   (3), 
where k is a coefficient. 
   Thus at small gaps the breakdown will appear at a smaller total charge. Since 
this  type  of  breakdown  is  associated  with  the  space  charge  effect,  it  depends 
also  on  electron’s  density  ne  in  the  cloud  of  primary  electrons  ne~Vno/n0.  The 
volume of the cloud Vno in turn depends on the density of the gas and also on 
the  diffusion  process.  For  example,  after  multiplication  in  the  GEM  holes,  the 
charge  cloud  expands  and  this  explains  why  the  pre-amplification  structures 
allow one to reach overall high gains [52].  
   Note that there could also be other phenomena restricting the Amax - electron 
jets  being  emitted  from  dielectric  insertions  on  the  cathodes  of  micropattern 

12 

 

detectors  [50,51,58].  Such  insertion  could  be,  for  example:  residues  due  to 
mechanical  or  chemical  treatments,  dust  particles,  dirt  ect.  Some  vapors  and 
gases can also form thin absorbed layers (actually liquid layers) on the cathode’s 
surface  which  then  play  a  role  of  the  insertions.  Such  “insertions”  could 
accumulate some positive surface charges due to ions from previous avalanches. 
This  surface  charge  may  create  extremely  high  electric  fields  inside  thin 
dielectric films and cause so called “explosive” field emission- jets of electrons 
sporadically distributed in time (see [50, 51, 58] for more details). The number 
of electrons in each emitted jet could stochastically vary between a few to up to 
105.  These  electrons  in  turn  trigger  Townsend  avalanches  in  the  micropattern 
detector.  If at some moment the number of primary electrons in the jet satisfies 
the  condition  (2),  then  the  streamer  could  be  formed  and  a  breakdown  will 
appear. 
   The  other  important  phenomena  in  the  operation  of  micropattern  gaseous 
detectors  are  surface  streamers  occurring  across  the  dielectric  supporting 
structures  between  the  anode  and  the  cathode’s electrodes [56]. The formation 
of  the  surface  streamers  is  not  directly  connected  to  the  value  of  qmax.  They 
could  develop  when  avalanches  along  the  surface  begin  to  propagate  and  the 
electric field due to the avalanche’s space charge and it’s image in the dielectric 
reaches some critical value. In this case, photoelectrons from the surface or the 
surrounding  gas  begin  to  move  towards  the  initial  surface-  attached  avalanche 
and forming gliding discharges. Surface streamers may prevent one to reach the 
maximum possible gains determined by the condition (2). It could be a serious 
problem at low distances between the electrodes. 
   The works on the optimization of micropattern detector’s designs mentioned 
in paragraph 4 were actually attempts to avoid conditions for the formation of 
streamers in the gas and across the dielectric surfaces. As was described above, 
the streamer in the gas could be suppressed if the external electric field drops 
sharply with the distance from the anode [56]. This is why micropattern 
detectors with thin anode strips (or with dot-type anodes) offered the highest 
gains [43].To restrict streamer propagation along the surfaces, specially shaped 
dielectric surfaces could be useful (for example -surfaces with grooves) [14,43]. 
 
7.2 High Counting  Rates 
 
It is a well established fact now that for all micropattern detectors the maximum 
achievable gain drops with the rate [50,51,58]-see Fig 8. It will be useful at this 
point to clarify a typical confusion. It has been known for a long time that for 
usual  wire  –type  detectors  the  actual  gain  A  drops  with  the  rate  H  (due  to  the 
space charge effect) and this actually prevents sparking at high rates. In contrast, 

 

13 

in  the  case  of  most  micropattern  detectors,  the  actual  gain  remains  unchanged 
with the rate: for each chosen value of A  the function A (H)=const. (see [58]  
for  more  details).  However,  the  maximum  achievable  gain  at  which  sparking 
appears  A  max  drops  with  the  rate-see  Fig.  8.  The  confusion  mentioned  above 
come from the fact that function Amax vs. rate for micropattern detectors looks 
very similar to the function A vs. rate for wire chambers. This formal similarity 
cause very common mistake in interpretation that in both cases this is the same 
effect: gain reduction due to the space charge created by avalanches. However it 
is not true (or not completely true). One can see from Fig. 8 that the Amax vs. the 
rate curve has different slopes which may reflect different physical mechanisms 
responsible for breakdowns. Indeed, even 

 

Fig. 8. Maximum gain vs. rate for several micropattern detectors. A dash line delimits the forbidden 
region (where discharges appear) [12, 50,51]. 
 
at the rate range of 102-103 Hz/mm2, the maximum achievable gain already 
begins to drop. Let us consider for simplicity an example with MICROMEGAS 
(see [59]). It is known that the ion- removal time from the MICROMEGAS’s 
gap is ~100 ns, so at these rates the positive ions for each particular avalanche 
are completely removed before the next avalanche begins to develop. Each 
avalanche therefore, develops completely independently from the previous one, 
so certainly there is some “memory“ effect: the detector “remembers” for quite a 
long time the previous avalanches and this somehow affects the maximum 
achievable gain. As was shown in several studies, this “memory” effect could be 
the charging up of the dielectric layers (including absorbed liquid layers [51])  

14 

 

and insertions on the cathode’s surfaces and associated with that jets of 
electrons. 
At  higher  rates  other  effects  may  contribute  as  well:  statistical  overlaps  of 
neighbouring  avalanches  in  time  and  space  (so  the  condition  (2)  could  be 
satisfied) [60], modification of the electric field in the cathode –anode’s gap due 
to  the  steady  space  charge,  multistep  ionization  [61,62],  gas  heating  and 
accumulation  of  the  exited  atoms  and  molecules  (which  may  also  lead  to  a 
sudden current growth and breakdown  (see [62] for more details). 
 
 7.3  The Position Resolution 
 
In the case of the detection of charged particles a very high position resolution 
could  be  achieved  with  micropattern  detectors.  For  example,  in  tracking 
measurements  σ~12 µm was achieved with MICROMEGAS [63] and ~40 µm 
with the GEM [64].  Thus the high granularity of micropattern detectors plays 
an important role in this application.  
However, in the case of the detection of X-rays it is not a straightforward task to 
exploit  the  high  granularity  of  micropattern  detectors.  Indeed,  the  range  of 
photoelectrons  even  in  the  heavy  gases  could  reach  a  few  mm  and  the 
fluorescent photons can propagate and cause other ionization events in as far as 
100-300  mm  from  the  first  absorption  event  [65].  Thus  high  granularity 
becomes quite useless. The standard approach in reaching a reasonable position 
resolution  is  by  operating  the  detector  at  an  elevated  pressure.  Recently 
however,  an  extremely  high  position  resolution  (better  than  50  µm)  was 
achieved with a microgap RPC operating at 1 atm [30]. The reason is clear by 
looking  at  Fig  4.  If  an  X–ray  radiation  enters  the  detector  close  to  its  cathode 
and  parallel  to  it,  the  photoelectron  tracks  will  originate  from  this  area.  The 
unique  feature  of  the  parallel-plate’s  geometry  is  that  the  gas  multiplication 
factor depends exponentially on the distance of the primary electrons from the 
cathode.  As  a  result,  the  main  contribution  to  the  signal  on  the  readout  strips 
gives  the  primary  electrons  created  near  the  cathode  -  a  region  where  the 
collimated X-ray beam is introduced. The other part of the photoelectron track, 
even  if  it  is  very  long  but  inclined  (and  most  of  the  tracks  are  inclined), 
contributes  very  little to the signal amplitude. Thus in this particular geometry 
one  can  detect  mostly  the  vertex  of  the  photoelectron  track  which  ensures 
extremely  high  position  resolutions.  In  this  particular  method  the  high 
segmentation of the micropattern detector plays a crucial role. 
We  can  now  try  to  answer  the  question  which  we  posed  at  the  beginning  of 
section  6: is there a need to develop “micro”-micropattern detectors with ∆ of a 
few  µm?  For  most  applications  today  a  position  resolution  of  12-40  µm  is 

 

15 

sufficient.  Of  course  this  fact  will  not  stop  further  developments  and  certainly 
more  and  more  new  designs  of  various  “micro”-micropattern  detectors  with 
position resolutions ~1 µm will appear in the nearest future. These designs may 
open new avenues in applications. One of these will be described in section 8.4. 
 
 
8.  Applications 
 
Nowadays the main applications for the micropattern are the same as for usual 
gaseous detectors:  
high energy physics, 
astrophysics, 
plasma diagnostics, 
medicine,  
biology and  
industry. 
These  traditional  applications  of  micropattern  detectors  have  already  been 
described  in  several  review    papers  [12,  13,  29,  66].  For  this  reason,  to  avoid 
any  repetition  we  will  here  focus  only  on    very  recent  and  very  “exotic” 
applications: 
the detection of visible photons, 
operation at extremely high counting rates (up to 10 10Hz/mm2), 
UV and X-ray imaging with position resolution of 30-50 µm at counting rates of 
105Hz/mm2 and  operation inside LAr/Xe. 
 
 
8.1 The Detection of Visible Photons 
 
During the last decade or so there have been a lot of efforts in the  development 
of gaseous detectors sensitive to visible light [67, 68]. The potential advantage 
of such detectors, compared to traditional vacuum ones, is their insensitivity to 
magnetic  fields  and  their  possibility  of  using  large-area  photocathodes  at  low 
costs. Unfortunately, traditional gaseous detectors combined with photocathodes 
sensitive  to  visible  light  suffer  from  feedback  even  at  gains  of  50  –100.  This 
gain  is  too  low  to  detect  single  photoelectrons.  These  developments  gained  a 
new  momentum  with  hole-  type  micropattern  detectors  (capillaries  and GEM). 
As was mentioned in paragraph 2.3 and in [67, 68], hole-type multipliers have 
two important advantages over the traditional avalanche detectors: 
1. efficient reduction or suppression of ion and photon feedbacks; and 

16 

 

2.  a  possibility  of  charge  extraction:  primary  electrons  or  avalanche–induced 
secondary electrons can be extracted from the holes and directed to a successive 
multiplication element. 
In recent woks with multistep hole-type detectors combined with photcathodes, 
gains  exceeding  103  were  successfully  achieved  [68].  The  first  attempts  on 
manufacturing  sealed  prototypes  were  also  made  [69-71].  Nowadays, 
Hamamatsu is evaluating these types of photomultipliers as possible commercial 
products [72]. 
 
8.2 Portal Imaging 
 
 Radiation therapy to day is applied to approximately 50% of  cancer patients. 
During treatment it is extremely important to monitor precisely the absolute 
intensity of the beam and its position with the respect to the tumor and the 
organs at risk. This could be done with a so called portal imaging device. It is 
designated for the monitoring and precise alignment of the pulsed cancer 
treatment gamma beam with respect to the patient’s tumor position. The latest 
will be determined from an X-ray image of the patient obtained in the time 
intervals between the gamma pulses. During treatment, the image of the gamma 
beam profile can be compared to the X-ray image. The data could then be fed 
back to the treatment machine, making fast online corrections in the gamma 
beam position. Recently, a prototype of a simple and cheap electronic portal 
imaging device based on hole-type detectors, GEMs and capillaries, was 
developed and tested (see [73] for more details). It was demonstrated that the 
GEM and the capillaries could operate stably at extremely high counting rates: 
107-1010 Hz/mm2. The first images obtained with this prototype  can be found in  
[74]. 
 
 
8.3  High Counting Rate X-ray Imaging 
 
In the last decade enormous efforts by various research groups and companies 
have  been  made  to  develop  digital  radiographic  devices.  The  most  attractive 
among  them  are  so-called  “photon-counting  devices”,  which  allow  one  to 
reduce  the  dose  during  the  image  taking.  The  high–position  resolution  RPC 
described  in  paragraph  2.4  is  one  of  the  most  promising  candidates  for  this 
application [30]. As an example, Fig. 9 shows the image of a fish obtained with 
a high position resolution RPC and for comparison, the same image obtained by 
standard  film  techniques.  It  is  obvious  that  the  quality  of  the  digital  image 
obtained  with  the  RPC  is  much  higher.  As  was  described  earlier  (see  chapter 

 

17 

2.4) this device can operate at rates as high as the parallel-plate detectors with 
metallic  electrodes.  However,  in  contrast  to  the  metallic  PPAC  it  is  spark-
protected  and  has  a  position  resolution  better  than  50  µm  in  digital  mode  at  a 
counting rate of 105Hz/mm2 [30].

film [75]. 
 
8. 4  The Operation of Micropattern and “Micro”--micropattern detectors 
inside LAr/Xe  
 
 
As  was  mentioned  above,  limits  in  gains  and  position  resolutions  of 
micropattern  detectors  are  actually  imposed  by  the  working  media  –gas  (see 
chapter  6).  From  this  point  of  view  it  will  be  interesting  to  investigate  their 
operation  in  a  more  dense  media.  Several  experiments  were  made  by  various 
groups with micropattern detectors operating at high pressure gases and inside 
noble  liquids.  It  has  been  discovered,  for  example,  that  micropattern  detectors 
can operate inside noble liquids at gains of >103 [76,77]. The first observations 
of  avalanche  multiplication  inside  the  noble  liquids  were  done  with  “micro”-
micropattern detector [76] as well as in  the so-called “Spindt cathode” shown in 
Fig. 6 [76]. 
The potential advantage of liquids over gases for the detection of particles and 
X-rays is that the intrinsic position resolution in liquids is  much better because 

18 

 

the density of the ions in the tracks is much greater and because the diffusion of 
the  drifting  electrons  is  less.  Successful  operations  of  micropattern  detectors 
inside noble liquids may open new avenues in applications, for example in noble 
liquid PETs [78] or WIPM detectors [79]. 
 
 
 
 
9.  Conclusions 
 
A revolution is currently taking place  in the development of gaseous detectors 
of  photons  and  particles.  Parallel  plate-type  and  wire-type  detectors,  which 
dominated for years in high energy and space flight experiments, are now being 
replaced  by  recently  invented  micropattern  gaseous  detectors.  Since  these 
detectors  are  cheap,  can  operate  at  relatively  high  gains  and  have  very  good 
position  resolutions,  they  may  compete  with  other  types  of  detectors,  for 
example  with    solid  state  detectors;  especially  in  those  fields  of  application 
where very low deposit energies are necessary to detect (tracking, X-rays, UV 
and visible photons) or where large sensitive areas are needed.

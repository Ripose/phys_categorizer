Abstract. We consider a perturbed Floquet Hamiltonian −i∂t + H + βV (ωt) in
the Hilbert space L2([0, T ], H, dt). Here H is a self-adjoint operator in H with a
discrete spectrum obeying a growing gap condition, V (t) is a symmetric bounded
operator in H depending on t 2π-periodically, ω = 2π/T is a frequency and β is a
coupling constant. The spectrum Spec(−i∂t + H) of the unperturbed part is pure
point and dense in R for almost every ω. This fact excludes application of the
regular perturbation theory. Nevertheless we show, for almost all ω and provided
V (t) is suﬃciently smooth, that the perturbation theory still makes sense, however,
with two modiﬁcations. First, the coupling constant is restricted to a set I which
need not be an interval but 0 is still a point of density of I. Second, the Rayleigh-
Schrodinger series are asymptotic to the perturbed eigen-value and the perturbed
eigen-vector.

1. Introduction

The so called Floquet Hamiltonians were introduced by Howland [10] and Yajima
[24] in order to study time-dependent quantum systems described by an Hamilton
operator H(t) acting in a Hilbert space
. Already before this strictly mathemat-
H
ical setting of the problem one could meet similar ideas in the physical literature
[21]. In our paper we restrict ourselves to T -periodic time-dependent Hamiltonians.
i∂t + H(t) and it
In this case the Floquet operator is formally written as K =

acts in the Hilbert space
, dt). Usually H(t) is decomposed into
a sum of a time-independent part H and a time-dependent perturbation βV (ωt)
where ω = 2π/T and β is a parameter (coupling constant). The primary question
to be answered is that of the character of the spectrum of K [9]. What makes this
task diﬃcult is the fact that, in many interesting situations, the spectrum of the
Floquet Hamiltonian associated to the unperturbed (time-independent) Hamilton-
ian H is pure-point and dense in R. Particularly this excludes application of the
regular perturbation theory due to Rellich [20] and Kato [13]. Let us mention a
few landmarks (but deﬁnitely not all of them) in the comparatively short history
of the problem which have motivated us to deal with this subject.

In the article [2] Bellissard introduced a technique to study time-dependent
Schr¨odinger equations which was inspired by the method of the proof of the clas-
sical KAM theorem [14, 1, 16]. He considered a model on the circle (in which
∆ with periodic boundary conditions) and he looked for
H
suﬃcient conditions to get pure-point spectrum of the associated Floquet Hamil-
tonian. The density of the unperturbed spectrum leads to a small divisors problem
which was mastered in this paper, for appropriate diophantine frequencies ω and
V ’s small enough, by a method similar to the original KAM algorithm. We note
that Bellissard considered a perturbation V acting as a multiplication operator by
a function analytic both in the time and in the spatial variable.

−

Soon after Combescure addressed in [5] the same question, with H being the
one-dimensional harmonic oscillator and V not necessarily analytic. To cope with
the lack of analyticity she has adapted the Nash-Moser regularization trick [16].
However she had to face a more severe problem: the spectrum of H did not satisfy
a growing gap condition (this is an important technical property which was satisﬁed
in the Bellissard’s model). This is why she had to restrict the class of admissible
perturbations, particularly excluding realistic local potentials. Let us mention also
the work [3] devoted to an interesting model with constant gaps in the spectrum of
H and with an analytic perturbation V .

Later on, the ﬁrst two authors of the present paper considered in [6] the same
question in a more abstract situation: H is discrete, simple, with a growing gap
condition (see formula (2.1)), acting in a separable Hilbert space
and with V
being not necessarily analytic. More precisely, one didn’t require that the matrix
entries of V in the eigen-basis of
i∂t + H were exponentially decaying. The paper
was based on a combination of two methods: the Nash-Moser trick and the adiabatic
regularization due to Howland [11]. The latter method makes it possible, roughly
speaking, to convert the regularity of V in the time variable into a regularity in the
spatial variable. For further development of this procedure the reader can consult
[17, 12]. We note that in the reference [11] Howland proposed another way to prove
the pure-point character of a spectrum which was based on a ”randomization” of
the original operator but he failed to extend this results to the case when H was a

Schr¨odinger operator.

Two main characteristics are common to all the above works. First, the results
are global in the sense that they describe the character of the full spectrum. Sec-
ond, all these approaches are based on the accelerated convergence method which
is of iterative nature. In fact, this method is an adaptation of a procedure used in
the celebrated KAM result concerning perturbations of classical integrable systems.
The present paper has another goal and an essentially diﬀerent method was neces-
sary to reach it. Here we concentrate on one single eigen-value. More precisely, for
operators of the same type as in [6] we shall answer aﬃrmatively the question: Is it
possible to show that one single unperturbed eigen-value gives rise to an eigen-value
of the perturbed operator?. We shall do it using a direct method, this is to say, by
showing directly that the standard eigen-value equation has a solution at least for
appropriate values of the coupling constant β.

In our approach the eigen-vector is written in a form of an inﬁnite series and to
verify its convergence we again have to cope with the small divisors problem (see
equation (3.3)). However we don’t use any kind of iterative methods and instead
we rearrange partially the series and estimate its summands directly. This compen-
sation method was probably more explicit in our previous paper [7]. This article
was inspired by the pioneering work of Eliasson [8] (see also an earlier paper by
Siegel [22]) and its purpose was to check some basic ideas on an explicit example.
Here we treat the general case but we borrow from [7] some intermediate results,
particularly this concerns Proposition 3.1 below. Apart of the rearrangement of the
series we use another crucial technical trick. This is a sort of a reduction procedure
based on the observation that the eigen-values of the unperturbed Floquet Hamil-
tonian which may be suspected to contribute by small denominators are rather rare
(see Sections 5 and 6). We note that this idea, in a bit heuristic version, already
appeared in the physical literature [18].

The paper is organized as follows. The main result (Theorem 2.1) is formulated
in the very beginning, i.e., in Section 2. The proof is split into several steps which
are carried out in the remainder of the paper, i.e., in Sections 3-8. In fact, already
after reading Section 3 one can guess about the structure of the proof. Its summary
is given at the end of Section 8. The paper contains three appendices. In Appendix
A we present, for the sake of completeness, a proof of the fact that the spectrum of
the unperturbed Floquet Hamiltonian is dense in R for almost all frequencies. In
Appendix B we construct an example of a perturbation for which the formal solution
of the equation on eigen-values (so called Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger series) doesn’t exist.
Appendix C contains a summary of the results about Lipschitz functions that we
need for our approach.

), and V (t) is symmetric for all t. The
perturbation V is naturally induced by the T -periodic function V (ωt), with ω :=
2π/T being the frequency, and it is, of course, bounded and self-adjoint. We assume
further that H is a self-adjoint operator in

Note that the matrix entries of V don’t depend on ω and so the frequency occurs
only in the eigen-values of K. The problem depends on two parameters – β and also
the period T . However, in the very beginning, we shall ﬁx ω so that a diophantine
condition (cf. (3.11)) is satisﬁed. Afterwards we don’t move the value ω anymore
and study the dependence only on the coupling constant.

F (β) which could be regarded as being inherited from the eigen-value F of K. The
regular perturbation theory due to Rellich [20] and Kato [13] in no way provides
an answer to this question since the set Spec(K) = ωZ + Spec(H) is dense in R
for almost all ω > 0. This property of the spectrum is quite familiar, nonetheless
we present an elementary proof in Appendix A. Recall that the basic assumption
for the regular theory to go through is that the eigen-value F is isolated. Also

because of the density of the spectrum, it makes little sense trying to relate, for a
single value of the parameter β, an eigen-value F (β) of K + βV to the distinguished
eigen-value F of K. But we shall show that it is reasonable to relate to F a whole
function F (β), for β running over some domain in the vicinity of zero.

In our case, F can be an accumulation point of Spec(K). On the other hand,
F is a simple eigen-value for a generic ω and so the operator K
F is injective
on the subspace Ran(Q). In fact, practically all subsequent manipulations will be
concerned with this subspace while the vector f plays a role of a ”source”. This
we denote by ˆX its block

corresponding to the subspace Ran(Q):

Then ( ˆK

F )−1 is a self-adjoint possibly unbounded operator.

There are more distinctions when comparing with the regular case. We will dis-
cuss this point in a bit more detail in Section 3. Here we recall that, according to
the Rellich-Kato theorem – the basic result of the regular perturbation theory, if
the eigen-value F was simple and isolated then F (β) would be an analytic function
on a neighbourhood of the origin. The same remark applies to the eigen-vector
f (β) provided a convenient normalizing condition has been imposed making it un-
ambiguous. For example, a normalization frequent in the physical literature [15]
requires that

On the contrary, this seems to be an intrinsic feature for the problems with
dense point spectrum that the common domain I for the functions F (β) and f (β)
cannot be chosen as an interval. Because of the resonance eﬀects it possesses
numerous ”holes”. Nevertheless 0 can be a point of density of I. Furthermore,
the relation of the RS series to the functions F (β) and f (β) is not straightforward.
A priori it is even not clear whether the coeﬃcients λj and gj are well deﬁned.
For example, the existence of λ2 in (2.5) is guaranteed by the condition QV f
∈
Dom(( ˆK
F )−1) which is not obvious at all. Fortunately it turns out that the
coeﬃcients do exist, up to some order, provided V (t) is suﬃciently smooth. Then
the RS series don’t determine F (β) and f (β) directly but instead they describe the
asymptotic behaviour of these functions as β

We conclude this section by a brief comparison of this theorem with some pre-
vious results. This concerns, ﬁrst of all, the mutual role of the two parameters
ω and β. A notable approach to the spectral problem of the operator K + βV
goes back to Bellissard [2] (see also [5], [6]). Also in this case, the spectrum of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian H was supposed to obey the same type of gap condition
(2.1). Under some smoothness assumptions on V (t), one is able to show that, for
each suﬃciently small β, there exists a set of “non-resonant” frequencies Ω(β) such
that the Lebesgue measure of the complement of Ω(β) is reasonably small and the
operator K + βV is pure point for each ω
Ω(β). The dependence of Ω(β) on
β is to be emphasized. On the contrary, the above theorem focuses only on one
distinguished eigen-value. But in this case one can choose the set Ω independently
of β so that it covers almost all frequencies ω > 0 in the Lebesgue sense. The basic
problem now is to construct a convenient domain I for the coupling constant β,
with ω
Ω being ﬁxed. Naturally I depends on the choice of the unperturbed
eigen-value.

We split the proof of Theorem 2.1 into several steps, each of them treated in
one of the subsequent sections. A summary of all the steps is given at the end of
Section 8.

3. Projection method, comparison with the regular case

We start the proof of Theorem 2.1 from the perturbed equation on eigen-values,

(K + βV )(f + g) = (F + λ)(f + g),

(3.1)

with λ
Ran(Q). Applying to
(3.1) the complementary projectors P and Q (commuting with K) we obtain an

For a while we shall consider λ as another auxiliary parameter and we will try to
solve the equation (3.3), referred to as the eigen-vector equation from now on. Its
solution is a vector-valued function g = g(β, λ) depending on both parameters β
and λ, and taking values in Ran(Q). Plugging g(β, λ) into the equality (3.2) we
get an implicit equation λ = G(β, λ) from which one should extract a function
λ = λ(β). Then

F (β) = F + λ(β)

and f (β) = f + g(β, λ(β))

(3.4)

will be the sought solution to our problem. This projection method was rediscovered
many times in the past and bears various names: Brillouin-Wigner, Feshbach,
Grushin, Schur, . . . .

Naturally this procedure can be applied to the regular case as well and one can
rederive this way the Rellich-Kato theorem. In order to emphasize the diﬀerence
between the regular and non-regular cases we sketch below the basic steps. But
before doing it let us introduce some more notation used throughout the paper. Set

the implicit mapping theorem tells us that there exists a unique analytic function
λ = λ(β) deﬁned on a neighbourhood of the origin and such that λ(0) = 0, λ(β) =
G(β, λ(β)). In accordance with (3.4) we get both the perturbed eigen-value F (β)
and the eigen-vector f (β) as uniquely determined analytic functions.

Let us return to our problem with dense point spectrum and with V being a
bounded perturbation. Violation of the condition (3.7) means exactly that the
operator Γ0 is unbounded. We shall need another but weaker condition in order to
be still able to cope with the equation (3.3). Diophantine estimates are the standard
tool used widely in this situation. Let us ﬁrst introduce the relevant exponents.
The integer ℓ, as speciﬁed in Theorem 2.1 (cf. (2.6)), obeys

Let us ﬁnish shortly the comparison of the regular and non-regular cases by
indicating some forthcoming steps. The discrete function ˜ψ(k) given in (3.12) will

4. Perturbation series

In this section we summarize a few basic facts about the RS series, particularly
we recall the explicit expressions for coeﬃcients in a form relying on some combi-
natorial notions. Basically we adopt the physical point of view according to which
one seeks the eigen-vector f (β) normalized by
= 1 [15]. In a more math-
ematically oriented approach one prefers to treat the orthogonal projector P (β)
onto the 1-dimensional subspace Cf (β) rather than the vector f (β) itself. Then
the corresponding formulas take an optically diﬀerent form [13]. But, of course,
our choice is only a matter of taste and convenience as the both approaches are
obviously equivalent; for example

f, f (β)

h

f (β) =

P (β)f .

On the other hand, the eigen-value F (β) is unambiguous and the result must be
the same in any case. This point has been discussed shortly in [7].

We are forced to use a bit more general setting since the functions F (β) and
f (β) need not be analytic and instead they are characterized by their asymptotics.

Let us continue the proof of Theorem 2.1. The arbitrarily small numbers in
Spec( ˆK
F ), so called small denominators, represent the principal diﬃculty we have
encountered in the preceding discussion. This is why the operator Γ0 = ( ˆK
F )−1 is
not bounded and thus it is not a priori clear whether the assumptions of Proposition
4.3 are fulﬁlled and whether the RS coeﬃcients exist at all. The second basic
ingredient of our approach, apart of the projection method, is the observation that
the indices suspected of enumerating small denominators are distributed rather
rarely in the lattice Z

indices by imposing the condition

Remarks. (1) The existence of the RS coeﬃcients is guaranteed by the diﬀerentia-
bility of V (t); the strong continuity is generally not suﬃcient. One can construct,
for almost all ω > 0, an operator-valued function V (t) which is strongly continu-
ous and such that already the coeﬃcient λ2 doesn’t exist. This is the subject of
Appendix B.

(2) For the choice of σ and τ speciﬁed in (3.9) it holds clearly true that σℓ < τ (ℓ+2)
and hence the assumptions of Proposition 5.4 are fulﬁlled. So the ﬁrst part of
Theorem 2.1 has been proven. On the other hand, this comparison suggests that
the assumption r > 16/α of Theorem 2.1 is very probably not optimal and could
be improved.

6. Solution of the eigen-vector equation

In the sequel we adopt a standard simpliﬁcation which doesn’t imply any loss of
Vηη means just the shift of the spectrum,

generality. Namely, replacing V by V

Spec(K + β(V

Vηη)) = Spec(K + βV )

while all eigen-vectors stay untouched. Also the assumptions of Theorem 2.1 are
not inﬂuenced by this replacement; particularly the coeﬃcient λ2 given in (2.5)
suﬀers no change (as Qf = 0). So from now on we assume that

Vηη ≡ h

Our task in this section is to solve the equation (6.3), at least for particular
values of β and λ. The ﬁrst observation is that (6.3) can be reduced to the subspace
Ran(PS). We deﬁne

W (β, λ) := V (1 + β ΓλPRV )−1 = (1 + β V ΓλPR)−1V .

β V ΓλPRV + . . . .
We start by checking more closely the term V ΓλPRV . Here is some additional
notation. As one observes from (2.2), a matrix entry Vmn depends on m1 and n1
only through the diﬀerence n1 −

m1; we write

Vmn =: V (n1 −

Proof. Concerning the uniform boundedness, one deduces from the formulas (7.4),
(7.5) and from the properties of the functions vn(λ), as discussed above (see the
deﬁnition (7.1)), that the problem reduces to an analogous assertion about the
functions W (β, λ)nn, n

valued function W (β, λ) is analytic in the indicated domain (see the deﬁnition (6.4)
and the related discussion).

We will solve (8.3) in a Lipschitz class. The notion of Lipschitz functions as well
as their properties needed for our purposes are recalled in Appendix C. This also
concerns the celebrated Whitney extension theorem [23]. We remind the reader
that the target space is generally allowed to be a Banach space or, more particu-
larly, a Banach algebra. When indicating that a function belongs to a Lipschitz
class supported on a closed set we always assume tacitly that this concerns the
corresponding restriction. We have to decide about the Lipschitz property of the
vector-valued function g(β, λ) deﬁned on
(r). Looking at the formulas (6.16)
and (6.17) one ﬁnds immediately that Γ(β, λ) is the only operator-valued function
occurring in the expressions which is not analytic (and so automatically Lipschitz).

Proof of Theorem 2.1. The ﬁrst part of the theorem has been already proven in
Section 5 – see Remark (2) at the end of the section. All the steps needed to show the
second part, too, have been already stated and so we have just to summarize them.
We make the choice of σ and τ as speciﬁed in (3.9). Proposition 6.5 guarantees
the existence of a solution g(β, λ) of the eigen-vector equation (6.3) provided (β, λ)

same set. According to Proposition 8.3,

˜λ′′(0) = 2λ2 6
= 0 (cf. (8.7) and (8.8)), Proposition 7.5 tells us that 0 is a point of
density of I. Finally, we know, again from Proposition 8.3, that both F (β) and
f (β) belong to the Lipschitz class Lip(ℓ + 1, I). According to Lemma 4.1, the same
is true for (K + βV )f (β). Moreover, since g(β, λ)

I. Then, as explained in Section 4, the coeﬃcients from the asymptotic
expansion of the functions F (β) and f (β) at β = 0 obey the equations (4.5) (or,
equivalently (4.6)). To complete the proof we note that Proposition 5.4 ensures the
existence and uniqueness of the solution to this system of equations and Proposition
4.3 gives its explicit form coinciding with the standard formulas known for RS series.

Appendix B. A perturbation without Rayleigh-Schr¨odinger series

In this appendix we exhibit an example of a perturbation for which λ2 given in
(2.5) does not exist. The symbols H, K, Ek, Fn, ek, fn and V retain their meaning
from Section 2. However we don’t require anymore that the eigen-values Ek of the
Hamiltonian H obey the gap condition (2.1). Instead we impose another restriction
which has this time a multiplicative form. More precisely, we assume that there
exist constants CM > 0 and µ > 0 such that

j < k =

(B.1)

Generally speaking, the conditions (2.1) and (B.1) are independent. However
in some cases, for example when the eigen-values Ek grow polynomially, Ek =
const kµ, the condition (B.1) appears to be milder than (2.1). Actually, the condi-
tion (2.1) is satisﬁed provided µ > 1 while (B.1) holds obviously for any µ positive.

Proposition B.1. Suppose that the spectrum Spec(H) satisﬁes the condition (B.1).
Then, for almost all ω > 0, there exists a bounded self-adjoint perturbation V (t)
which is a 2π-periodic and strongly continuous function of t and such that the

the interval [ p−1k, p−1(k + M −1) ] and is decreasing on ]p−1(k + M −1), p−1(k + 1)[

Proof. This would be a classical text-book result if the random variables Yk were

for almost all ζ > 0.

Proof. Clearly it suﬃces to show that (B.25) is valid for almost all ζ from an
arbitrary bounded interval [ 0, z ], z > 0. Having observed that the condition (B.17)
is invariant with respect to the scaling of hk we can restrict ourselves to ζ
[ 0, 1 ].
Furthermore, the conclusion of the lemma is not inﬂuenced by omitting several ﬁrst
hk}k. This is why we can assume that the assumptions

Appendix C. Lipschitz functions

Here we present some auxiliary results concerning Lipschitz functions which are
quite straightforward to verify but are not mentioned in [23], our main source on
this subject. Moreover, in view of applications we are interested in, we allow the
target space to be generally a Banach algebra (sometimes only a Banach space)
rather than C.
In fact, this doesn’t cause any essential complication – one has
just to be careful about the order of multipliers in all expressions. The notation
in this appendix is autonomous, particularly the symbols f, g, P etc. have diﬀerent
meaning in the main text of the paper.

Deﬁnition C.1. Suppose that Π

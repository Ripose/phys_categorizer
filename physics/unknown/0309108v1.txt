The  Big  Bang  frame  of  work  for  cosmology  is  a  theoretical  construct 

based  upon  one  possible  interpretation  of  the  Hubble  observation  of  the  red 

shift from distant galaxiwa. Almost all of the scientific experimental evidence 

has been interpreted under the Big-Bang hypothesis. And the results have been 

very promising though with a few important drawbacks. The main point in our 

present work is to prove that the expansion of the Universe, the essence of the 

Big-Bang,  is  based  upon  an  apparent  interpretation  of  the  distance-red  shift

relation  found  by  Hubble.  On  the  contrary,  an  absolute  interpretation  as  we 

give  here  results  in  a  constant  size  Universe,  together  with  a  shrinking 

quantum  world.  This  is  the  role  of  Planck´s  constant:  the  red  shift-distance 

relation  can  be  interpreted  as  evidence  of  an  expanding  Universe  or, 

alternatively, as evidence as evidence of a shrinking quantum world due to the 

decrease of Planck´s constant with cosmological time. 

When  considering  possible  time  variations  of  fundamental  physical 

constants  one  has  to  keep  firm  well  established  principles.  Following  this 

approach  we  keep  firm  the  Action  Principle,  General  Relativity  (the 

Equivalence  Principle),  and  Mach’s  Principle.  Also  we  introduce  a  new 

principle  under  the  name  of  “TOTAL  INTERACTION”  and  reconsider 

Weinberg’s  relation  with  a  new  approach.  We  find  that  all  masses  increase 

linearly  with  cosmological  time  (THE  MASS  BOOM).  The  speed  of  light 

turns out to be decreasing also  with time. An “absolute” cosmological  model 

arises, similar to the one  Einstein proposed, static, closed and finite,  with the 

cosmological  constant  included.  The  “relative”  model,  the  Universe  as  seen 

from the Lab observers, is an expanding one with a quadratic law in time for 

the cosmological scale factor, a model that fits all recent observations of dark 

mass and dark energy contents in the Universe, as well as the Supernova Type 

Ia data.

1.- INTRODUCTION 

 

The  beginning  of  scientific  cosmology  can  be  placed  with  the 

advent of the  cosmological equations of Einstein, as derived from his theory 

of general relativity. A Universe with masses, and therefore gravitation, would 

be expected to contract, and that was the case initially predicted. To avoid this, 

and have a static solution for the Universe as a whole, Einstein included in his 

equations a cosmological constant, the lambda term, that resulted in a push to 

balance gravitation. Then he obtained a static model, with curved space giving 

a  closed  as  well  as  finite  Universe.  Later  Hubble  found  the  redshift  from 

distant  galaxies  to  increase  with  distance.  One  of  the  possible  explanations 

was to consider  that  the  Universe  was expanding as seen from any  observer. 

Of  course,  going  backwards  in  time,  with  this  interpretation  the  Universe 

would  be  seen  as  contracting,  therefore  would  be  initially  “born”  from  a 

relatively  small  size  and  much  hotter  and  denser  than  now.  An  expanding 

Universe,  found  as  a  solution  to  the  Einstein´s  equations,  was  proposed  by 

Friedman  and  therefore  the  scientific  community  had  a  theoretical  frame  to 

explain one interpretation of Hubble´s discovery. The concept of an expanding 

Universe from an initial Big Bang spread rapidly and has been considered the 

best model, and therefore the best frame, to interpret all current observations. 

 

3 

Nevertheless this model has many problems and contains many paradoxes that 

have been in part solved with additional theoretical inclusions (e.g. inflation). 

In the present work we introduce the concept of a Mass Boom, already 

present  in  the  literature1  two  years  ago  at  the  IV  International  Congress  in 

Hyderabad,  India,  but  now  we  present  here  important  modifications  and 

refinements.  Keeping  first  principles  firm  we  prove  that  all  masses  grow 

(increase)  linearly  with  cosmological  time.  Conservation  of  momentum 

implies then that the speed of light decreases linearly with time. It is seen that 

Mach´s  principle,  and  its  equivalent  the  principle  of  equivalence,  give  a 

unique solution for the Universe that excludes expansion. We then reinterpret 

the  redshift  found  by  Hubble,  and  prove  that  at  the  laboratory  system  it  is 

proportional  to Planck´s “constant”,  a result  that  comes from  the comparison 

of  frequencies.  The  new  interpretation  that  we  present  here  depends 

exclusively on Planck´s “constant”, that we find decreasing with cosmological 

time. The constancy of Planck´s units of time and mass completely defines the 

time  variation  of  the  Planck´s  constant.  The  new  model  we  propose  for  the 

Universe  is  a  static,  closed  and  finite  one,  as  Einstein  initially  proposed.  On 

the other hand we find a quantum  world contracting  with cosmological time, 

in accordance  with the decrease of Planck´s constant, as  interpreted from the 

redshift. It is clear that if we take the quantum world as the reference, then the 

 

4 

Universe  would  be  apparently  expanding.  It  turns  out  that  this  apparent 

expansion  is  an  accelerated  one,  something  already  observed  from  the 

supernova type Ia measurements2. The apparent expansion we find is a(t) (cid:181)

 t2, 

for the cosmological scale factor a(t). 

 

We 

then  solve  the  cosmological  equations,  and  find 

the 

corresponding numerical values for the dimensionless matter parameter W m = 

1/3  and  the  lambda  parameter  W

L   =  2/3,  which  are  very  close  to  the  values 

observed  in  many  experiments.  It  turns  out  that  the  apparent  curvature  term 

becomes  rapidly  negligible  with  age,  so  that  practically  we  live  in  a  flat 

Universe, as  seen from  our  Lab,  also  a  well  known  current  observation. The 

entropy  of  the  Universe  is  found  to  be  equivalent  in  some  way  to  the 

cosmological time, as well as to the total matter of the Universe. Then, we can 

talk of a Mass Boom as well as an Entropy Boom, equivalent to cosmological 

time.  

 

The natural units that emerge from this model, the “true constants 

of  nature”  are  Planck´s  mass  and  time,  and  of  course  the  present  size  of  the 

Universe  ct  »

  1028 cms,  which  is  the  Planck´s  length  at  the  first  “tic”  of  the 

Universe (at the Planck´s time).

Finally,  the  Pioneer  10/11  anomalous  acceleration3  recently 

observed  is  explained  by  our  theory  presented  here.  We  take  this  as  an 

experimental evidence of the Mass Boom effect. 

2.- THE MASS BOOM, PREDICTED BY FIRST PRINCIPLES. 

There  have  been  doubts  whether  general  relativity  included 

Mach´s  principle  or  not.  Certainly  it  includes  the  equivalence  principle,  and 

now we will present an interpretation of both principles that proves them to be 

equivalent. One interpretation of Mach´s principle considers the mass (energy) 

of a particle  m as due to  its  gravitational potential energy  with respect to  the 

mass Mu of the rest of the Universe 

                                

                                        (1)

General relativity is based upon the equivalence principle. One way to express 

it  in  mathematical terms is to preserve, under any sort of time-variations, the 

ratio of the square of any speed due to gravitation, v2 =GM/r , to the square of 

the speed of light c2, i.e.

The  constancy  of  this  ratio  ensures  the  preservation  of  the  principle  of 

relativity under cosmological time variations. If we substitute for the size r the 

size of the seeable Universe, ct, and for M the mass of the Universe Mu , one 

gets

We see that the expressions (1) and (3) are equivalent. In the next section on 

the action principle we prove that G and c3 have to be proportional to preserve 

the standard form of the field equations of general relativity. The result is that 

the mass of the Universe has to be proportional to the cosmological time (the 

Mass Boom) :

We  present  now  what  we  call  the  total  interaction  principle.  It  is  a 

mathematical expression that follows the requirement that all the gravitational 

interactions  in  the  Universe  must have  a  mean  free  path,  under a  Newtonian 

point of view, of the order of the size of the Universe. Then,

and  therefore  we  obtain  again  the  Mass  Boom  effect.  Since  Mu  and  m  are 

proportional  to  time,  the  number  of  particles  of cosmological  significance  in 

the  Universe is  constant.  The time  dependence  corresponds  to the  mass.  The 

above presentation has been submitted to Physics Essays6 . 

 

3.- THE ACTION PRINCIPLE    

 

Einstein’s  field  equations  can  be  derived  from  an  action  integral 

following the Least Action Principle. In standard general relativity one has for 

the action integral 7:  

     A  =  IG + IM 

     A  =  - c3 / (16p G)  (cid:242)  R (g)1/2 d4x    +   IM                              (12) 

where IM is the  matter action and IG the gravitational term. Then one obtains 

the field equations 

                                 G

 = 8p (G /c4 ). T

                                                     (13)

We  assume  a  space-time  metric  and  use  the  Robertson-Walker  model  that 

satisfies the Weyl postulate and the cosmological principle, i.e.  

    ds2  =   c(t)2  dt2  - R2(t) { dr2  / (1-kr2)  + r2 ( dq 2 + sin2 q

  df 2 ) }               (14) 

Einstein´s  equations  (13)  follow  from  the  Action  (12)  provided  that    the 

variation of the coefficient in the integral  in equation (12)  be zero. Then 

                                    c3/(16p G)=  constant                                                 (15)  

We see that the assumption of a time varying G must include a time varying c 

to preserve the form of the field equations.  

 

The  equation  (15)  strongly  suggests  a  specific  link  between  mass  and 

                         c3/G »

  4.04 x 1038 grams/sec = constant                              (16)  

which is of the order of the ratio of the mass of the observable Universe to its 

time. This is 

age. 

 

On the other hand, the action for a free material point is 

                                      A= - mc (cid:242)  ds                                                              (17)  

To  preserve  standard  mechanics  we  make  the  momentum  mc  constant, 

independent from the cosmological time, then 

                                       mc = constant                                                          (18)  

With the constancies expressed in (15) and (18), general relativity is preserved 

and  of  course  the  Newtonian  mechanics  too.  Within  these  limits  time 

 

10 

variations of some of the fundamental constants, G, c and masses, are allowed 

at the same time preserving the laws of physics as we know them today. From 

(18) and the Mass Boom effect, the speed of light decreases linearly with time 

c (cid:181)

 1/t . It is evident that, with such a law for the speed of light, the size of the 

Universe ( of the order of ct ) is constant and therefore there is no “absolute” 

expansion. 

4.-REINTERPRETATION OF THE RED SHIFT:  TIME VARIATION 

OF PLANCK´S “CONSTANT”. 

The  ratio  of  frequencies  observed  at  the  laboratory  system,  photons 

from distant  galaxies as n

 = c/l

 and local atomic clocks as n o (cid:181)

 mc2/

(cid:2)

  ,  with 

mc constant and l

 also constant (no expansion), gives a red shift proportional 

(cid:2)

to 

.  With  no  expansion  the  red  shift  implies  a  decreasing  Planck´s 

“constant”. Now, Planck´s units are defined as a combination of G, c and 

 : 

(cid:2)

                            Planck´s mass         (

(cid:2)

c/G)1/2 = 2 x 10-5 grams

(cid:2)

/c3)1/2 = 1.6 x 10-33 cm               (19) 

 

 

 

 

 

11 

It is evident that if we choose a system of units such that G = c3 , as required 

by the Mass Boom effect on the whole Universe, and such that 

(cid:3)

 = c2, we get 

Planck´s units of mass and time as the “natural” units of mass and time. This 

is very appealing because the ratio of the mass and age of the Universe to the 

corresponding  Planck´s  units  is  the  same  factor  of  about  1061.  On  the  other 

hand the constant size of the Universe, the model we present here, has a value 

of the order of ct = 1028 cm, which is Planck´s length at the first “tic” of time 

(at Planck´s time). 

 We see now that the Boom of an initial fluctuation of time and mass 

of the Planck´s units, by the factor 1061, brings the fluctuation up to the state 

of the Universe as we observe it today in time and mass. On the other hand 

this initial fluctuation had a size of the order of Planck´s length at that time, 

which is the constant size of the Universe up to today (about 1028 cm).  

 

Then, this factor of 1061 is representative  of the evolution of the  initial 

fluctuation, as characterized by the Planck´s units, followed then by the Mass 

Boom  to  bring  the  Universe to  the present conditions.  The  magic number of 

the  Universe  is  then  1061,  as  representative  of  its  evolution  from  the  initial 

 

 

12 

fluctuation up to now. The cosmology to be studied now in this model is one 

that keeps G = c3 , 

(cid:4)

 = c2 and ct = 1.

consistent  with  this  interpretation  of  the  redshift  as  a  decrease  in 

(cid:4)

,  the 

curvature  term  in  (20)  decreases  as  t-4  so  that  it  is  negligible,  and  we  are 

observing  essentially  a 

flat  Universe.  With 

the  present 

reasonable 

approximation  of  zero  pressure  (neglecting  random  speeds  of  galaxies),  and 

substituting a(t) (cid:181)

 t2 in (20) we finally get the cosmological equations:

These  numbers  are  very  close  to  the  current  values  observed  at  present.  The 

accelerated  expansion  of  the  Universe8  is  then  an  apparent  effect  due  to  the 

quadratic relation a(t) (cid:181)

the  well  known  Bekenstein9  and  Hawking10  relations  for  entropy,  as  well  as 

the classical  definition, the result is the same: there  is no escape, the entropy 

varies linearly with time and for the Universe the high entropy of today is due 

to the fact that the Universe is very old. There is no entropy problem in our 

 

Boltzmann constant k varies in our theory as c. To see this we have the

Taking  the  laboratory  system

           7.- THE MAGIC NUMBERS 

 

The  only  magic  number  we  found  here  is  1061  that  brings  the  first 

Planck  fluctuation  to  the  present  state  of  the  Universe.  The  Dirac  magic 

number 1040, as the ratio of the size of the Universe to the size of fundamental 

constants, and the ratio of electric to gravitational forces, is a function of time 

in  our  approach  here.  Therefore  the  similarity  of  these  two  values  is  a 

coincidence in our interpretation. Weinberg´s  relation7, that can be derived by 

equating  the  gravitational  cross  section  (6)  of  a  particle  of  mass  m  to  the 

square of its Compton wavelength, is

 m3                                                        (26)  

The time dependence  implied here for a typical mass m of a particle  is m3 (cid:181)

 

1/t which has no meaning in our approach. But at the Lab system we have 

(cid:8)

 = 

constant and then we get from (20) that m is proportional to time t, again the 

Mass Boom is also present here.

 e2/

 = (e/c)2                                           (27)  

There have been no cosmologically significant time variations in  a

, by 

that  meaning  variations  of  the order of  the variation  of the  cosmological age 

considered.  Then  one  must  have  e/c  =  constant,  and  therefore  the  electronic 

charge e varies as c, inversely proportional to t. However,  in electromagnetic 

units (e/c) is a true constant, so that the Zeemann displacement is a constant in 

this theory, contrary to the statement we made elsewhere1. 

The  apparent  Hubble  “constant”  in  this  theory  is  H  =  2/t  ,  due  to  the 

cosmological scale factor varying as t2. Hence the Hubble age in this theory is 

twice as much as the standard one. It is suggested that the age of the Universe 

may be as much as twice what we have been thinking up to now. 

Finally  the  Pioneer3  10/11  anomalous  acceleration  observed  can  be 

explained here by the ratio of the laboratory system reference frequency (

of  about  8  x  10-8  cm/sec2.  Our  theory  explains  the  anomalous  acceleration 

observed in the Pioneer 10/11 probes.               

 

 

9.- CONCLUSIONS   

 

The  Mass  Boom  proposed,  linear  increase  of  all  masses  with  time, 

implies here a linear decrease of the speed of light. The resultant cosmological 

model,  static,  almost  flat,  closed  and  finite,  has  cosmological  parameters  in 

accordance  with  current  observations.  The  main  problems  of  the  standard 

model are solved: entropy, lambda constant, horizon etc. In fact many of these 

problems are one and the same thing. Solving one you solve all of them. This 

is the case here.  

 

Finally,  the  time  reversibility  of  all  the  equations  of  physics  poses  a 

deep 

theoretical  problem:  nature  has 

irreversible  process,  and 

this 

irreversibility  is  not  now  explicit  in  the  standard  basic  equations  of  physics 

(Newton´s  mechanics,  quantum  mechanics,  general  relativity,  etc).  With  our 

approach the Mass Boom ensures that irreversibility is present everywhere: in 

 

18 

fact we have proved that it corresponds to an Entropy Boom linear with time. 

On  our  theory  irreversibility  comes  from  the  basic  process  of  gravity  quanta 

emission, responsible for the Mass Boom, the time Boom, the Entropy Boom.

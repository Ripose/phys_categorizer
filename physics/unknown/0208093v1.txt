Abstract

If we try to measure the backward optical diffraction radiation (BODR) of high

energy electrons from a conductive slit or a semi infinitive plate, the electron beam will

pass thru the bending or steering magnets or magnet lenses before striking the target.

The synchrotron radiation (SR) from these magnets can obscure the BODR

measurements. An analysis of the properties of SR from these magnets is in this paper

presented. A model based on the modified Lenar Wikherd potentials was created, and

the SR angular distribution from relativistic electrons in bending and steering magnets

for different conditions of radiation in the optical region was calculated. The analysis

shows, that for the conditions of the KEK ATF extraction line, the intensity of SR

exceeds that of the backward optical transition radiation (BOTR) from the conducting

targets, and it is much lager than the intensity of the BODR. The SR intensity from the

steering magnets depends on its tuning and may be comparable to BOTR. Thus, these

results it is seen, that the problem of separation of the BODR and SR in the BODR

measurements is important. Two methods resolving of this problem is in this article

suggested.

1.  Introduction

 Recently, attention has been devoted to using BODR as a new non-invasive tool for

ultrarelativistic beams. Castellano [1] considered the possibility of determining the

transverse beam size using BODR characteristics when the beam moves through a slit

in a perpendicular screen. It was suggested that the BODR angular distribution be

measured in the vicinity of the initial electron beam direction. Fiorito et al.[3] have

suggested that the BODR generated by a particle passing through a circular aperture in

a conducting screen be used for the noninvasive diagnostics of the beams position,

size, and divergence. Ref [2] considered the possibility of carrying out a proof-of-

principle experiment at KEK-ATF for estimating the prospects of BODR usage for non-

invasive beam diagnostics. Thus, the BODR monitor is a promising candidate for single-

pulse beam-profile measurements, and that it will be an extremely useful instrument for

future linear colliders (e.g. JLC, NLC,TESLA and CLIC).

However, synchrotron emission contribution  may be obstacle for the realization of

these projects. We can see this, if we try to measure the BODR of relativistic electrons

of more then 200 MeV energy from conductive slit ore semi infinitive plate. The electron

beam passes the bending or steering magnets or magnet lenses before striking the

target  (see Fig.1).

The geometry of SR production for BODR investigations.

 Thus in the target region there will be synchrotron radiation (SR) from these

magnets. This radiation may reflect from the target passing in the same direction as the

investigated radiation. How intensive  this radiation is in comparison with the

investigated BODR is important, because it may be obstacle for the BODR

measurements. Therefore, the analysis of the properties of SR from these magnets is

necessary. Usually one considers the SR from the middle of bending magnets ([4]). In

our case SR  is generated from the edge of magnets, when electrons transit from

magnetic field into free motion. Ref [5] considered the SR emitted at the edge of magnet

using simple dipole approach, which can not to be applied to large sources such a

bending magnet. The SR characteristics depend on the experimental conditions (e.g.

bending radius, electron energy, and length of bending trajectory). Therefore an

elaboration of the theoretical model for specified conditions is necessary.

2.  The theoretical model for the calculation of the properties of SR from the

edge of magnets.

For building of the theoretical model let me to use the Fourier presentation of the

because in our case the size of SR source is comparable to the distance between

source and observation point. Therefore we will divide the bending magnet into a series

of many small magnets (so, that for each magnet we can use the dipole approach).  We

will then sum the field of all magnets. In integral limit we obtain:

We cannot obtain from (3) the full analytical expression for real experimental condition,

but it is possible to calculate it numerically. Below we present the numerically

calculations of the SR properties for different experimental conditions. For checking of

this model we calculate the distribution of SR from the middle of magnet end compare it

with the similar calculations using a well-known model [4]. Fig.2 is shows the spectra-

angular distribution of SR from the middle of magnet with deflecting radius 8 m for
electron energy E0» 1.26 GeV and for the length of magnetic field 1 .28 m, calculated

using our model.

A similar distribution, calculated using formula from [4], gives the same results.

3.  Properties of synchrotron radiation from edge of bending magnet for KEK

ATF extraction line condition.

 Let us consider the example of SR properties for the experimental conditions of the

KEK ATF extraction line. Let us also consider the horizontal and vertical component of

the SR electromagnetic field (horizontal an vertical SR polarization) in terms of the

geometry shown in Fig.1.

The main properties of KEK ATF extraction line, related to our problem are: the

energy of accelerated electrons E0=1.26 GeV (g =2470), the inflection radius of electron

orbit in bending magnet (BM) R=8 m, and the length of BM magnetic field along the

electron trajectory   L=1.28 m.
Our first calculations show that if R/g << L, the SR properties from the edge of magnet

for these conditions do not depend on L.  Also the spectral dependence in the optical
region is weak. Thus, for KEK ATF conditions only two factors (g  and R) influence on

the SR properties. Fig.3 shows the SR intensity angular distribution calculated using (3)

for above-mentioned conditions.

extraction line. qh  - horizontal angle, qv   - vertical one (see Fig.1)

Fig.3

In Fig.3, and further in the paper, the angles are presented in units of g -1. Here q h  = 0
corresponds to the outgoing electron velocity direction and negative q h corresponds to
the direction of electron deflection. For the large positive q h the SR angular distribution

transforms to the case of SR from the middle of the BM (see Fig.2). The radiation
intensity at the angle q h» 1 exceeds significantly the radiation from the middle of magnet.

Fig.4 and Fig.5 shows the angular distribution of SR intensity of both polarizations. We

see from these figures, that intensity of horizontal polarization exceeds approximately

two times the one of vertical polarization.

These results were obtained for an abrupt edge of the magnetic field, but a

defused field on the edge of magnets is more appropriate. Therefore an estimation of

possible contribution of the defused part of magnetic field should be made.

We considered for this purpose the approach of linear dissipation of defused

fields at the edge of magnet. The calculation of SR distribution is illustrated on Fig.3,4,5
shows, that for the size of defused part of magnetic field less than 5R/g  the deviation of

SR distribution does not exceeds 5%.

We will now compare the intensity of possible types of radiation, which may be

observed in case of BODR investigation. Fig.6 shows the horizontal angular distribution

of intensity of SR, BOTR and BODR.

important.

       These distributions show that the SR differential intensity is comparable to the

BOTR and may be much lager than the intensity of the BODR. Thus, the problem of

separating BODR and SR for BODR experimental investigation and beam analysis is

4.  Properties of synchrotron radiation from steering magnets

The characteristics of the steering magnet (SM) magnetic field may differ

significant from that of the BM. The magnetic field of the SM can be tuned over a wide

range of values, and the length L of magnetic field along the electron trajectory is much

smaller than one of the BM. For instance for the SM of KEK ATF extraction line L=6 cm.

Thus, the condition R/g << L for SM may not be fulfilled and the influence of both edges

of magnetic field will take place. Nevertheless, our model allows us to calculate the SR

distribution for these conditions. If R/g  is comparable to L, then two parameters g  and

electron inflecting angle d

 are important for the SR angular distribution. Fig.7 shows the

calculated SR distribution from the SM of KEK ATF extraction line for different inflecting
angles d

. Analysys of these distributions shows that the SR differential intensity

depends strongly on the inflecting angle d

. For d

» 1 mrad the intensity of SR from the

SM may exceed that from the BM. Fig.8 shows the intensity in maximum of angular SR

distribution as a function of electron inflecting angle.

As can be seen, the SR from the steering magnets should be accounted for

during BOTR investigations. The SR from the BM is usually stable while the SR from

electron beam.

5.  Possible ways of SR suppression

Some laboratories [3,8] that use the BOTR for beam diagnostics on accelerators

of similar experimental conditions have not experienced any problems from SR.

However, the aim of their investigations was the observation of the BOTR spot on the

target for beam size measurements. Usual microscopes of high quality are used for this

purpose, but all information about BOTR angular distribution in this case is lost. The

major characteristic of BODR for beam diagnostics is the angular distribution (see [1,2]);

therefore we cannot directly use this method.

The analysis of the SR properties shows, that we can suppress significant the SR

contribution by two ways: 1. As we can see on Fig.3, the yield of SR in the aperture size
of S in the center of angular distribution is proportional to » S4. If we decrease the size of

BODR target as much as possible, we decrease the contribution of the reflected SR.

The limit of this possibility is determined by the possible violation of the semi-infinity

plane approach. However, if the contribution of several magnets take place, this method

may not be effective. 2.Another way may be realized using a bi-concave lens. We can

use for this purpose the difference between the positions of the SR and BODR (or

BOTR) souces. The principle of such suppression is shown on Fig.9.

We consider here the forward transition radiation (TR) and forward diffraction one (DR)

for visual simplicity. The same principle can be used for backward radiation.

Even though the angular distributions that of the SR and DR (TR) are the same, the

defocusing lens scatters the SR much more than that of the TR and the DR, as it is

shown in the figure. Since the intensity of radiation is proportional to the 1/q 2, the

intensity of the SR after lens is attenuated more than that of the DR and the TR. The

optics should be optimized to exclude the significant contribution in angular distribution

of DR and TR source size on the target. The SR suppression using this method

depends on the the distance from the magnet to the target, and from the target to the

detector. It also depends on the DR (TR) source size on the target.

A possible method of the optical SR suppression

In conclusion, the problem of SR suppression may be difficult for determining

angular BODR properties for the beam diagnostics and further attention is neeeded for

its resolution. The size of BODR target should be decreased as much as possible. The

SR suppression should be also forced using a bi-concave lens.

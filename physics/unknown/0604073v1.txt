1. Introducere 
In  a  natural  light  beam  the  electric  field  vector  (or  light  vector)  oscillates  with  the  same 
amplitude  in  all  planes  which  contain  the  direction  of  propagation.  When  the  natural  light 
passes through optical devices, the oscillations of the light vector in some directions can be 
attenuated and so we obtain the partial polarized light, like in fig. 1(in which the direction of 
propagation of the light beam is perpendicular to the figure plane). The degree of polarization 
of the light is defined as:

where  I1 is the intensity corresponding to the oscillation, which has maximum amplitude, and  
I2  is  the  intensity  corresponding  to  minimum  amplitude  oscillation.  The  magnitude  P 
characterizes also the polarizing capacity of the device. 
The devices called generally polarizers should have to produce total polarized light, i.e. the 
light in which vibration exists in a single plane which contains the direction of propagation. 
But  a  real  polarizer,  especially  those  that  are  inexpensive,  furnishes  rather  partial  polarized 
light. For this reason, before using a polarizer, it is necessary to be able to verify  it. In  this 
way, we propose here a method to evaluate the degree of polarization of a real polarizer, in 
the circumstances when we haven’t any perfect polarizer.

2. The degree of polarization of a real polarizer 
The  experimental  arrangement  used  to  this  aim  is  composed  of  an  optical  bench  where  are 
disposed,  in  order,  a  source  of  natural  light  (an  electric  bulb),  two  identical  real  polarizing 
filters (conventionally called, the first – polarizer, and the second – analizer) and a photocell 
to measure the light intensity. 
We make the assumption that the polar diagram of the intensity of the transmitted light by the 
real polarizer is an ellipse, whom great axis, i.e. the transmission axis of the polarizer, is along 
Ox axis (fig.2). 
Each vibration in  the incident natural  light having  the intensity I0, can be resolved into two 
components  on  the  axes  Ox  and  Oy  of  the  polarizer.  The  resultants  on  each  axis  have  the 
same  intensity,    Ix=Iy=I0/2.  By  passing  through  the  real  polarizer,  which  has  the  degree  of 
polarization P, we admit, for the sake of simplicity, that the component along Ox axis passes 
, but the component along the Oy axis is attenuated. So, from the 
not being attenuated,

where the subscripts xp and yp refer to the components along the respective axes transmitted 
by the polarizer. From (2) one can obtains the attenuation ratio for Oy direction:

If  the  light  that  passed  through  the  polarizer  meets  an  analyzer,  identical  with  the  polarizer 
and having the axes parallel to those of the polarizer, the component parallel to the Ox axis of

So, behind the analizer the light intensity is maximum and equal to:

Thus,  measuring  the  maximum  and  minimum  intensities  transmitted  by  analyzer,  from  (10) 
one can obtain the degree of polarization. When the polarizers are perfect, i.e. P=1, then from 
(5) it results 

                                                         (10)

3. Malus’ law for real polarizer 
It is known that Malus’ law refers to the beam intensity that passes a perfect analyzer, when 
the incident light is total polarized; the law expresses: 

α2

I

I =

                                                            (11) 
0 cos
where  I0  is  the  linearly  (total)  polarized  incident  light  intensity,  obtained  using  a  perfect 
polarizer, and α is the angle between the plane of polarization of the light and the transmission 
axis of the analyzer. 
In  the  case  of  real  polarizers,  relation  (11)  does  not  hold.  In  order  to  establish  an  adequate 
relation, let’s consider that the OxP axis of a real polarizer makes the angle α with OxA axis of 
a real analyzer (fig. 4). The partially polarized light that passes the polarizer is equivalent to 
two components which oscillate along OxP and OyP axes, to whom correspond the amplitudes 
ExP and EyP , respectively the intensities IxP and IzP. Each of them will have projection onto 
OxA and OyA axes, and the corresponding intensities of these projections are:

So, the incident light   on  the  analyzer,  corresponding  to  vibrations  parallel  to  his  axes,  will 
have the intensities:

Passing through the real analyzer, the light intensity which  corresponds to vibrations along 
OxA  axis  remains  unmodified  but  that  which  corresponds  to  vibrations  along  OyA  axis  is 
attenuated by a factor η; thus in view of (16), (17) and (3), the emergent intensity is:

The  relations  (20)  and  (21)  represent  a  generalization  of  Malus’law;  if  the  polarizers  are 
perfect, P=1, then from (21) one obtains the usually form of the Malus’ law (11). 
The emergent light intensity from analyzer,  IA, can be expressed as a function of the incident 
light intensity, partially polarized by polarizer:

which  gives  the  relation  between  the  emergent  intensity  from  analyzer  and  the  incident 
intensity, similarly to (11).  
In Fig. 5 we present, both, the α-angle dependence of the experimentally measured emergent 
intensity  from  analyzer,  using  the  experimental  device  described  above,  and  the  calculated 
intensity  using  (21),  in  which  the  polarization  degree  was  determined  with  (10).  The 
satisfactory concordance of the two curves confirms the correctness of the assumptions of the 
model used in obtaining of the generalized Malus’ law.

4. Conclusions 
The  formula  (10),  established  in  the  paper,  offers  the  possibility  to  measure  the  degree  of 
polarization  caused  by  real  polarizers,  when  we  have  not  any  perfect  polarizer.  The 
generalized formula of  Malus’ law supplies the values of the intensity of emerging light from 
a  real  polarizer,  when  the  incident  light  is  partially  polarized,  in  good  agreement  with 
measured data.

Abstract.  We  study  one-dimensional  (1D)  and  two-dimensional  (2D)  Helium  atoms 
using  a  new  time-dependent  quantum  Monte  Carlo  (TDQMC)  method.  The  TDQMC 
method employs random walkers, with a separate guiding wave attached to each walker. 
The ground state is calculated by a self-consistent solution of complex-time Schrödinger 
equations for the guiding waves and of equations for the velocity fields of the walkers. 
Our results show that the  many-body wavefunction  and the ground state  energy of the 
model atoms are very close to those predicted by the standard diffusion quantum Monte 
Carlo  method.  The  obtained  ground  state  can  further  be  used  to  examine  correlated 
time-dependent  processes  which  include,  for  example,  interaction  of  atoms  and 
molecules with external electromagnetic fields.

1.  Introduction 

 

The  many-electron  problem  is  one  of  the  most  intractable  problems  of  quantum  physics.  The  great 
difficulty  is  that  the  motions  of  the  electrons  in  atoms  and  molecules  are  correlated  because  of  the 
strong  Coulomb  repulsion  between  their  negative  charges.  The  solution  of  the  many-electron 
Schrödinger equation is therefore a complicated function of 3N variables, where N  is the  number of 
electrons  in  the  system.  The  introduction  of  density  functional  theory  (DFT)  made  it  possible  to 
reformulate  theory  in  such  a  way  that  the  important  physical  quantity  is  the  electron  density,  rather 
than the wavefunction, reducing the dimensionality of the problem to three [1]. In this way in DFT the 
many-body problem is effectively relocated into the definition of the exchange-correlation functional, 
whose mathematical expression as function of the electron density is not currently known and unlikely 
ever  to  be  known  exactly.  The  many-electron  problem  becomes  even  more  complex  when  time 
dependent processes in external fields are involved in the dynamics, e.g. where short-pulse ionization 
and/or  charge  transfer  take  place.  Such  processes  become  increasingly  important  with  the  advent  of 
attosecond-duration soft x-ray laser sources [2,3] which made it possible to conduct experiments with 
unprecedented  time  resolution.  Clearly,  the  time-dependent  Hartree–Fock  approximation,  which 
neglects  electron  correlation,  fails  to  reproduce  the  correct  correlated  electron  dynamics.  The  time-
dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) offers a possibility to include the correlation effects in a 
numerically tractable way [4]. Parametrized functionals are constructed which allow the calculation of 
ionization probabilities from the time-dependent density alone. However, it has been shown that the 
time-dependent exchange-correlation potentials may not be sufficient to describe the correct electron 
correlated dynamics in time-varying fields. It was pointed out [5] that not only the density at a given 
time but its whole history enters the exchange-correlation term in a time-dependent calculation. If the 
history of the density is ignored, ambiguities are introduced into the representation of excited states. 
More recently, much progress has been achieved by multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree [6] 
(-Fock  [7])  method  which  allows  the  inclusion  of  electron  correlation  effects  in  a  more  systematic 
way. 

A completely different approach to the electron correlation problem is offered by the quantum 
Monte Carlo (QMC) techniques, a scheme which in principle can yield the exact ground state energy 
and wavefunction of a complex quantum system [8]. For example, the diffusion QMC is based on the 
similarity between the imaginary time solution of the Schrödinger equation and a generalized diffusion 
stochastic  motion  of  Brownian  particles  (walkers),  where  one  can  compute  the  value  of  the 
wavefunction  by  following  the  motion  of  these  walkers  in  configuration  space.  In  order  that  higher 
accuracy is attained it is necessary to guide the walkers using a guide function that well approximates 
the exact wavefunction. Often, variational QMC is used as a fist approximation since the trial energy 
is close to the exact one and the wavefunction accurately approximates the ground state wavefunction. 
The  QMC  represents  the  most  accurate  method  currently  available  for  medium-sized  and  large 
systems. Standard QMC calculations scale as the third power of the number of electrons (the same as 
DFT), and are capable of treating molecules as well as solid crystalline phases [9].  

However, the present day QMC techniques suffer from a serious drawback in that they cannot 
describe time dependent processes, e.g. in atoms exposed to an external field, including charge transfer 
and ionization. One of the underlying reasons is that in QMC the stochastic component in the walker’s 
motion (the creation/destruction of configurations) is dominating the evolution of the system while the 
guide function plays a secondary role. Recently, different approach was proposed [10] where separate 
guide function is attributed to each individual walker and these guide functions evolve according to the 
time dependent Schrödinger equation, concurrently with the motion of the corresponding walkers. In 
this way the guide waves and the classical particles (walkers) participate in the dynamics on an equal 
footing. In this paper we consider the preparation of the atomic ground state within the frames of the 
new time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo (TDQMC) technique.

potential.    In  the  standard  diffusion  quantum  Monte  Carlo  (DMC)  we  first  pick  an  ensemble  of 
configurations  chosen  from  a  certain  distribution.  This  ensemble  is  next  evolved  according  to  the 
short-time  approximation  to  the  Green  function  of  equation  (1),  for  imaginary  time.  Within  this 
approximation  the  Green  function  separates  into  two  processes:  random  diffusive  jumps  of  the 
configurations arising from the kinetic term and creation/destruction of configurations arising from the 
potential  energy  term  [11].  In  presence  of  a  guide  function,  an  additional  drift  of  the  particles  is 
introduced that is proportional to the gradient of the guide function, as the guide function is the same 
for many particles. In TDQMC approach considered here each walker from the ensemble is attached to 
its own complex-valued guide function which evolves in time, concurrently with the evolution of the 
trajectory of that walker. This is accomplished by factorization of the many-body wavefunction as a  
product  of  single-particle  time-dependent  guide  functions 
, 
and  we  assume  that  each  electron  is  represented  by  an  ensemble  of  M  walkers.  Then,  the  guide 
function 
  for  the  k-th  walker  from  the  i-th  electron  ensemble  evolves  according  to  the  time 
dependent Schrödinger equation (see [10]):

single-particle  Schrödinger  equations  coupled  by  a  time  dependent  potential  which  includes  the 
momentary total Coulomb field experienced by each walker. This potential is a sum of the Coulomb 
fields of the walkers which represent the rest of the electrons (the third term in equation (2)). On the 
other hand, the walkers also experience force that is proportional to the gradient of the guide function. 
In conventional DMC that force is a result of the importance sampling procedure, which transforms 
the  Schrödinger  equation  into  a  Fokker-Planck-type  of  equation  [8].  In  TDQMC  complex-valued 
wavefunctions  are  used,  and  therefore  the  walkers  are  guided  by  using  the  de  Broglie-Bohm  pilot-
wave relation [12]:

contained  set  of  equations  of  motion  for  the  walkers  and  the  guide  waves.  The  intimate  connection 
between equations (2) and (3) can be revealed if we represent the many-body wavefunction as a polar

leads  to  the  set  of  equations  (2)  and  (3).  Since  the  Schrödinger  equation  (1)  does  not  contain  spin 
variables,  the  electron  statistics  is  determined  by  the  symmetry  properties  of  the  many-body 
wavefunction  under  exchange  of  the  arguments.  However,  in  contrast  to  the  Hartree-Fock 
approximation,  the  equations  for  the  guiding  waves  (equation  (2))  do  not  contain  exchange  terms. 
Therefore,  the  exchange  interaction  between  parallel-spin  electrons  should  be  accounted  for  by 
equation (3), where the many-body wavefunction can be represented as a single Slater determinant (or

3.  Results 
 
It is important to stress that the TDQMC formalism does not involve calculation of integrals, which 
has been a major stumbling point for most of the non-Monte Carlo methods. Although in TDQMC we 
still  calculate  wavefunctions,  the  quantities  of  physical  interest  are  expressed  entirely  in  terms  of 
walker  configurations.  For  example,  the  energy  of  the  stationary  states  of  the  Hamiltonian  can  be 
calculated as a sum over the walker’s positions, where the modulus of the guide waves is taken:

The standard DMC uses imaginary-time propagation where the wavefunction remains real-valued at 
all times. In TDQMC complex time is used instead, which ensures a non-zero velocity of the walkers 
in  equation  (3).  By  working  with  complex-valued  wavefunctions  in  TDQMC  we  assume  that  the 
walker  distribution  corresponds  to  the  probability  density  (modulus  squared  of  the  guide  function), 
whereas in DMC the walker distribution corresponds to the modulus of the guide function. It is worth 
mentioning  also  that  in  TDQMC  formalism  no  initial  guess  for  the  ground  state  energy  is  required 
because  the  guide  waves  evolve  inevitably  to  the  ground  state  of  the  system.  In  DMC  the  guide 
function  is  constructed  to  minimize  the  number  of  divergences  in  the  local  energy  caused  by  the 
Coulomb interactions. This is done by using appropriate Slater–Jastrow-type many-body wavefunction 
which  includes  free  parameters  to  be  optimized  [13].  In  TDQMC  the  correlation  is  accounted  for 
naturally through explicit Coulomb potentials, with no free parameters involved.  

First, we compare the walker motion in DMC and in TDQMC. To this end, one-dimensional 
and  two-dimensional  Helium  atoms  are  considered  where  the  two  electrons  with  anti-parallel  spin 
evolve  from  the  initial  state  to  the  ground  state.  In  order  to  specify  the  role  of  the  electron-electron 
correlation  we  use  smoothed  Coulomb  potentials  with  different  parameters  for  the  electron-nuclear 
interaction:

The calculation begins with randomly positioned walkers with equal initial guide functions. The time 
evolution  of  both  the  walker’s  position  and  the  guide  wave  is  determined  by  a  self-consistent 
numerical  solution  of  the  set  of  equations  (2)  and  (3),  where  each  walker  experiences  a  specific 
quantum force along its trajectory, and we add a linearly-decreasing in time random component to the 
walker position in order to thermalize the distribution at each time step. This thermalization is needed 
to  avoid  possible  bias  in  the  final  walker  distribution  for  the  ground  state  that  may  arise  due  to  the 
quantum drift alone. Additional selection of walkers can be used in this method, by destructing some 
of the walkers.

First,  the  ground  state  of  one-dimensional  Helium  atom  is  calculated  by  using  DMC  and  TDQMC 
techniques. 1D-Helium is very appropriate for comparison of the results from the two models because 
its  configuration  space  is  two-dimensional.  We  choose  the  two-body  wavefunction  to  be  symmetric 
with  respect  to  the  two  electrons,  which  features  equivalent  electrons  of  opposite  spin  (singlet-spin 
.  In  this  simulation  5000  random 
ground  state),  i.e. 
+ ϕ
1
walkers are used with an initial Gaussian distribution of width 1 atomic unit (a.u) and with all initial 
guide functions centered at the core. In this calculation the smoothing parameters in equations (5) and 
(6)  are  a=1  a.u.  and  b=0.2  a.u.,  which  corresponds  to  strongly  correlated  electrons  where  electron-
electron  interaction  dominates  over  electron-nuclear  interaction.  Spatial  grid  size  of  30  a.u.  and 
complex-time step size (0.05,-0.05) in atomic time-units are used. Figure 1 shows the time evolution 
of the trajectories of two random walkers from the ensemble, which correspond to the two electrons of 
the atom for DMC and for TDQMC, after 300 time steps. It is seen from figure 1(b) that the TDQMC 
trajectories tend to steady-state positions close to the end of the interval, whereas the DMC trajectories 
(figure 1(a)) experience random jumps at all times. The different behavior in these two cases is due to 
the  essentially  different  mechanisms  for  walker guiding  used  in  the  two  techniques.  In  TDQMC  the 
guide functions evolve to steady-state where the right-hand side in equation (3) approaches zero, while 
in DMC the walker coordinates experience random jumps at each time step. The final distribution of 
walkers  is  shown  in  figure  2.  In  TDQMC  calculation  the  guide functions  are  normalized  to  unity  at 
each  time  step.  The  predicted  ground  state  energy  is  -1.942  a.u.  for  DMC,  and  -1.936  a.u.  for 
TDQMC.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  walker  distributions  shown  in  figure  2(a)  and  2(b)  look  very 
different  although  they  represent  two  identical  ground  states.  This  is  because  in  DMC  the  walker 
ensemble  approximates  the  ground  state  wavefunction,  while  in  TDQMC  it  corresponds  to  the 
probability density. 

In order to compare more precisely the two distributions shown in figure 2, we present in figure 3 
the contour maps obtained after interpolation of these distributions with Gaussians of width 0.5 a.u., and 
next squaring up the distribution from figure 2(a) to obtain the probability density. It is seen that the two 
maps  are  very  similar,  and  they  exhibit  the  characteristic  fluted  contours  where  the  dents  along  the 

 

5

x1=x2 line evidence the correlated electron motion [14]. We also compare the TDQMC results for the 
ground state energy with the results from the exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian for 1D Helium,

which yields -1.941 a.u. For the same  parameters, the Hartree-Fock approximation gives -1.836 a.u. 
for  the  ground  state  energy.  Therefore,  we  see  that  a  large  portion  of  the  ground  state  correlation 
energy is taken into account by TDQMC method. 

 

Figure 3. Contour maps of the walker distributions from figure 2: (a) for DMC and (b) 
for TDQMC.  

Next,  we  calculate  the  walker  distribution  for  the  ground  state  of  two-dimensional  Helium 
 
atom by using TDQMC technique. For a=1 a.u. and b=0.2 a.u. in equations (5) and (6), the ground 
state energy predicted by DMC is -1.5155 a.u. while TDQMC gives -1.5012 a.u. Since in this case the 
configuration  space  is  four-dimensional  (x1,y1,x2,y2),  we  can  only  show  2D-sections  of  that 
distribution.  Figure  4  shows  four  2D-sections  which  correspond  to  the  (x1,y1),  (x1,x2),  (x1,y2),  and 
(y1,y2)  walker  distributions.  It  is  seen  in  figure  4(a)  that  the  (x1,y1)  distribution  is  symmetric  in  all 
directions, which is expected since the two coordinates of each separate electron are independent. On 
the other hand, the shapes of the (x1,x2) and the (y1,y2) distributions in figure 4(b) and 4(d) are similar 
to the 1D case (see figures 2 and 3), but the dents along the x1=x2 and  y1=y2 lines are not that seeable. 
This is due to the additional degree of freedom experienced by the electrons in two dimensions which 
reduces their correlated interaction to the case where both of their x and y coordinates are close. The

square-shape  distribution  shown  if  figure  4(c)  evidences  the  degree  of  correlation  between  the 
“crossed” electron coordinates (x1,y2), which is weaker than the correlation between the “uncrossed” 
coordinates  (x1,x2),  (y1,y2).  This  is  a  result  of  the  specific  form  of  the  electron-electron  Coulomb 
potential in Cartesian coordinates.

For fermionic systems, the ground state wavefunction has nodes where it changes sign. These 
nodes are essential for the state to be antisymmetric with respect to exchange of any two particles. If 
no antisymmetry is imposed, the application of the DMC method results in a bosonic solution of lower 
energy than the true fermionic ground state. The most successful method to address the nodal problem 
in DMC is the fixed node approximation, followed by an algorithm that releases the nodes of the guide 
function in order to obtain their correct locations [15]. The key approximation in the fixed-node DMC 
method is the use of an approximate nodal surface from the guiding function. In practice, the nodes of 
HF or DFT wavefunctions (Slater determinants) are used. In DMC, if the random walk crosses a node 
of the trial function, that walker is deleted. In TDQMC the nodes occur naturally by the dependence of 
the  many-body  wavefunction  on  the  individual  time-dependent  guide  functions.  Whenever  a  walker 
approaches  a  nodal  surface,  the  drift  velocity  in  equation  (3)  grows  and  carries  it  away.  The  latter 
follows  also  from  the  general  properties  of  quantum  hydrodynamic  trajectories,  where  the  quantum 
potential keeps these away from the nodal regions and thus they cannot pass through nodes [12]. In 
other words, the antisymmetry of the wavefunction creates an exchange hole that keeps parallel-spin 
electrons apart from each other.

4. Conclusions 
 
In  conclusion,  we  explore  a  new  time  dependent  quantum  Monte  Carlo  approach  where  quantum 
dynamics is modeled by using ensembles of both particles and guiding waves. In this technique, the 
electron-electron  interaction  (correlation)  is  accounted  for  by  using  explicit  Coulomb  potentials, 
instead  of  exchange-correlation  potentials  as  is  done  in  the  time  dependent  density  functional 
approximation.  This  approach  is  useful  for  simulations  of  very  fast  (attosecond-duration)  strongly 
correlated phenomena in complex systems such as molecules, clusters, and nanostructures, where fast 
ionization and/or charge transfer may take place. Other promising applications of TDQMC include the 
calculation  of  electromagnetic  fields  in  arbitrary  proximity  of  the  quantum  objects,  well  beyond  the 
dipole approximation [16]. Since the calculation of guiding functions is included at each time step, the 
TDQMC  technique  is  more  computationally  expensive  than  the  conventional  DMC.  However, 
similarly  to  DMC,  the  TDQMC  algorithm  is  intrinsically  parallel  and  thus  it  is  easily  adapted  to 
parallel computers, with a speedup that scales linearly with the number of processors.

Spectroscopic investigations of the properties of a plasma produced by a flashboard 
plasma source, commonly used in pulsed plasma experiments, are presented. The plasma 
is used to prefill a planar 0.4-m s-conduction time plasma opening switch (POS). A novel 
gas-doping technique and a secondary surface flashover plasma source are used to locally 
dope  the  plasma  with  gaseous  and  solid  materials,  respectively,  allowing  for  spatially-
resolved  measurements. The electron density, temperature, and plasma composition are 
determined from spectral line intensities and line profiles. Detailed collisional-radiative 
modeling is used to analyze the observed line intensities. The propagation velocity and 
divergence  angle  of  various  ions  are  determined  from  time-of-flight  measurements  and 
Doppler  broadening  of  spectral  lines,  respectively.  This  allows  for  distinguishing  the 
secondary  plasma  ejected  from  the  POS  electrodes  from  the  plasma  of  the  flashboard 
source.

I.  Introduction 

The need for reproducible plasma sources with various properties (electron density, 
electron  temperature,  plasma  composition  and  uniformity)  for  different  pulsed-power 
applications such as ion diodes [1] and plasma opening switches (POS) [2] encouraged 
the  development  of  a  variety  of  plasma  sources.  Among  the  most  popular  schemes  are 
plasma guns [3], flashboards [4,5], gaseous plasma sources [6,7], and explosive emission 
sources [8]. In plasma (or cable) guns, a flashover occurs across the insulator at the end 
of a high-voltage cable. Flashboards are printed circuit boards consisting of a number of 
chains, each with a set of flashover gaps in series. A high-voltage pulse is applied to the 
ends of each chain and a surface breakdown is initiated across the gaps. 

The  primary  goal  of  this  work  is  to  study  the  plasma  properties  of  a  flashboard 
plasma  source  as  a  first  step  towards  a  thorough  investigation  of  the  physics  of  the 
interaction  between  plasmas  and  magnetic  fields  in  general,  and  in  particular  that  of 
POS’s. In our setup the flashboard plasma source is used to prefill a planar POS (0.4-m s-
conduction time and 160 kA peak current) coupled to an inductive load. 

Previous experimental studies of flashboards include a detailed investigation of the 
plasma  flow  velocity  and  uniformity  for  various  driving  circuits  and  flashboard 
configurations [5] using electrical probes. A recent experiment [9], in which the electron 
density  was  determined  both  by  spectroscopic  measurements  and  by  electrical  probes, 
showed that electrical probes underestimate the electron density of a flashboard plasma 
by  up  to  an  order  of  magnitude.  A  spectroscopic  investigation  of  the  electron  density, 
temperature,  and  plasma  composition  was  carried  out  on  a  flashboard  driven  by  a 
relatively low current through the discharge chains [10]. In that work, the peak electron 
density ne was determined to be 2· 1013 cm-3 and the plasma was found to mainly consist 
of CII and CIII. However, it should be noted that the density of CIV and CV could not be 
determined in those experiments due to the low electron temperature. Plasma guns being 
closely  related  to  flashboards  have  been  studied  [3,10,11,12]  using  various  techniques 
that showed the plasma mainly consists of carbon ions with electron densities up to » 1014 
cm-3.  Interferometry  was  implemented  to  determine  the  line-integrated  electron  density 
and its spatial distribution in a few POS experiments [13,14,15] where either plasma guns 
or  flashboards  were  used.  As  will  be  shown  below,  determining  the  electron  density, 
temperature  and  plasma  composition  in  such  plasma  sources  is  a  complex  problem 
involving  various  processes  such  as  plasma  flow,  ionization,  and  secondary  plasma 
creation.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  these  characteristics  have  as  yet  not  been 
determined  satisfactorily  in  flashboard  and  plasma  gun  plasmas.  In  this  work  we 
determine  these  plasma  properties  using  different  spectroscopic  observations  together 
with atomic-physics modeling. 

High resolution spectroscopy is employed to measure line profiles and intensities 
of  a  variety  of  spectral  lines.  Spatial  resolution  along  the  line  of  sight  is  obtained  by 
doping the plasma with different elements and observing the characteristic emission from 
the doped species. To this end, we employ our newly developed gas injection [16] and 
surface flashover techniques to locally dope the plasma with gaseous and ionic material, 
respectively.  The  versatility  of  the  doping  methods  also  allows  us  to  perform 
measurements using a wide variety of dopant elements which enables us to study many 
important  plasma  parameters.  Furthermore,  by  measuring  and  analyzing  spectral  lines 
 
 

2 

belonging to a few different elements we are able to reduce the errors introduced by the 
uncertainty of the different atomic rates. 

The  plasma  electron  density  is obtained from Stark broadening of the Ha  and Hb  
lines  of  hydrogen.  A  second  complementary  method,  based  on  spectral  line  ratios  of 
MgII,  is  used  to  study  the  electron  density  at  early  times  when  ne  <  1014  cm-3  and  the 
Stark  broadening  yields  less  reliable  results.  It  was  verified  that  for  high  electron 
temperatures (Te > 10 eV) and low electron densities, the ratio between the MgII 3p and 
3d  level  populations  depends  primarily  on  ne.  A  third  method  compares  the  absolute 
intensity of doped ArI lines with collisional-radiative calculations and the known argon 
density. The use of a few methods provides us with a more reliable electron density and 
enables measurements in a wide range of densities (1· 1013 -2· 1015 cm-3). 

The  electron  temperature  is  obtained  from  the  temporal  evolution  and  absolute 
intensities of spectral line emissions of various doped gases. The observed evolution of 
spectral  lines  from  different  charge-state  ions  is  compared  to  collisional-radiative  (CR) 
calculations  [17].  Other,  more  conventional  methods  for  determining  the  electron 
temperature such as spectral line ratios, could not be fully implemented here. A typical 
procedure would be to compare the line intensities from levels with significantly different 
energies  both  of  which  should  not  be  too  high.  Here,  this  requirement  could  not  be 
fulfilled due to the rapid ionization of low charge-state species and the possible presence 
of non-thermal electrons. 

The plasma composition is obtained from the absolute intensities of spectral lines 
belonging to a variety of species that make up the plasma. To this end, CR calculations 
that are based on the determined electron density and temperature are used for calculating 
the ratio between the excited level populations and the total density of the specific ion. 
The  effects  of  charge  exchange  between  CV  and  hydrogen  are  examined  and  found  to 
significantly affect some of the CIV excited level populations, allowing the CV density to 
be  determined.  It  is  shown  that  the  plasma  mainly  consists  of  protons,  hydrogen,  and 
carbon ions. By comparing the plasma composition with and without the POS electrodes 
in place we are able to determine which ions originate from the flashboard and which are 
coming off the POS electrodes. The use of the gas doping also allows for studying the 
non-radiating proton plasma at the front of the expanding plasma cloud by observing the 
excitation  of  the  doped  gas  by  the  electrons  in  the  proton  plasma.  We  believe  that  the 
diagnostic methods described here can be used for studying plasma sources and transient 
plasmas in general. 

 

II. Experimental Setup 

Two  flashboards  are  used  to  generate  the  plasma.  A  single  2.8-m F  capacitor 
charged to 35 kV drives the flashboards via sixteen 75-W
 cables, giving a peak current of 
6 kA per chain at t = 1.2 m s. The flashboards are positioned next to each other in such a 
way that the peak plasma density is generated in the middle of the plasma volume. Each 
of the flashboards has eight chains and each chain consists of 8 copper islands on a G-10 
insulator of a 0.07-cm thickness with a 1.5-cm gap between the chains. The islands are 

 
 

3 

0.5  cm  in  diameter  and  are  separated  by  0.05-cm  gaps  (in  our  experiments  the 
flashboards are not coated with carbon spray as is commonly done). 

The  flashboards  are  placed  3  cm  above  the  8-cm-long  region  of  the  POS 
transparent anode, see Figure 1. The planar POS electrodes are 14 cm wide (along the y-
direction) and are 2.6 cm apart. In the POS region, the electrodes are highly transparent 
and consist of 0.1 cm-diameter wires separated by 1.4 cm. This high transparency ensures 
free  plasma  flow  through  the  anode  and  little  plasma  stagnation  near  the  cathode.  The 
flashboard is operated » 1.2 m s before the high-current pulse of the POS is applied. The 
following  coordinates  are  defined:  x  =  0  is  the  cathode,  y  =  0  is  the  center  of  the 
electrodes, and z = 0 is the generator-side edge of the anode transparent region. 

The  gas  doping  arrangement,  consisting  of  a  fast  gas  valve,  a  nozzle  and  a 
skimmer,  is  mounted  below  the  cathode  on  a  moveable  stand  that  allows  for  2D 
movement. The dopant-gas beam was diagnosed using a specially-designed, high spatial-
resolution ionization probe array [16] that allows the absolute gas density and the beam 
width to be determined. The gas density can be varied from approximately 1013 to 3· 1014 
cm-3  by  changing  the  time  delay  between  the  operation  of  the  gas  valve  and  the 
flashboard. The full width half maximum (FWHM) of the gas beam perpendicular to its 
injection could be varied from 1 to 2 cm by changing the aperture of the skimmer.  

Alternatively, for doping solid materials such as magnesium, we used an electrical 
discharge over an epoxy resin mixed with the desired element. A small G-10 board was 
placed 2 cm below the cathode and a discharge was driven by a 2 m F capacitor charged to 
6  kV.  The  hereby-produced  plasma  was  diagnosed  spectroscopically  for  various  time 
delays between this discharge and the operation of the flashboard. An upper limit of the 
electron  density  of  the  doped  material  is  determined  from  the  absolute  intensity  of  the 
MgII  3p-3s  transition  without  the  operation  of  the  flashboard  plasma.  The  emission  of 
this line is found to be very weak. To assure that the weak emissions do not result from 
an exceedingly low electron temperature (<1 eV) with a relatively high electron density, 
we  compare  the  emission  with  and  without  the  application  of  the  flashboard  and  make 
use of the fact that once the doped column mixes with the flashboard plasma the electron 
temperature of the combined plasma is at least 3 eV and the combined electron density is 
» 1013 cm-3 at t=450– 30 ns. Then, by performing measurements with different time delays 
between the doping discharge and the flashboard operation we obtain an upper bound on 
the  electron  density  of  the  doping  discharge  as  a  function  of  time.  For  the  short  time 
delays used in the present experiments, the electron density of the plasma created by the 
doping discharge was found to be less than 1· 1013 cm-3, ensuring no significant effect on 
the flashboard plasma parameters.  

For the short time delays used here, the neutral and electron densities of the doped 
column are small enough inside the A-K gap to assure they do not significantly perturb 
the flashboard plasma. The density of neutrals such as MgI and CI are negligible in the 
A-K  gap  due  to  the  rapid  ionization  caused  by  the  flashboard-plasma  electrons.  The 
density of neutral hydrogen produced by the solid doping discharge is significantly lower 
than the hydrogen density ejected off the POS electrodes. We did not measure the density 
outside the A-K gap, however, based on comparison of measurements with different time 
delays we believe both the electron and the neutral densities to be <1014 cm-3 even 1 cm 
beyond the cathode.

Mirrors and lenses are used to direct the light onto a 1-meter spectrometer equipped 
with a 2400 grooves/mm grating. Observations along all three lines of sight are possible, 
however,  in  this  work  we  present  only  observations  performed  along  the  y-direction. 
Observations along the x-direction are performed through the flashboards. A cylindrical 
lens  images  the  output  of  the  spectrometer  onto  a  rectangular  optical-fiber  array  at 
different  magnifications  allowing  for  observations  with  different  spectral  dispersions. 
The  optical-fiber  array  consists  of  12  vertical  fiber  stacks  that  deliver  the  light  to  12 
photomultipliers whose temporal resolution is 7 ns. The spectral resolution of our optical 
system is 0.07 Å. 

The absolute sensitivity of the optical system was measured using a few absolutely-
calibrated  lamps.  In  order  to  reduce  the  error  in  the  relative  calibration  at  different 
wavelengths  we  measured  the  light  intensities  of  different  spectral  lines  that  originate 
from  the  same  excited  level.  We  observed  the  CII  2837-Å  and  6578-Å  lines,  the  NII 
6284-Å and 3919-Å, and the SiII 2072-Å and 4130-Å lines. An accuracy of – 10% for the 
relative sensitivity and – 30% for the absolute calibration was determined. 

III. Experimental Results 

A.  Measurements and Data analysis 

We  observe  the  time-dependent  intensities  and  spectral  profiles  of  lines  from  the 
plasma  constituents  (mainly  hydrogen,  carbon,  and  oxygen)  and  the  doped  materials 
(such as helium, argon, and magnesium), as given in Table I. The line profiles are fitted 
using a Gaussian, from which the instrumental broadening is deconvolved. The width of 
the various lines is analyzed assuming Stark and Doppler broadening (all spectral lines 
used in this study are optically thin). The measured line intensities yield populations of 
the  transition  upper  levels  by  using  the  Einstein  coefficients  of  the  transitions,  the 
observed  light  emitting  volume  and  the  absolute  sensitivity  of  the  optical  system.  The 
level  populations  are  then  compared  to  time-dependent  CR  calculations  in  order  to 
determine  the  plasma  parameters  such  as  ne  and  Te.  The  level  populations  given 
throughout this paper are divided by statistical weight. 

The typical velocities of species doped using the gaseous doping are 1· 105 cm/s so 
that  within  1  m s  their  motion  is  negligible.  However,  for  the  plasma  and  solid  doping 
constituent the ion velocities are a few times 106 cm/s so that their motion during the time 
of interest is significant. To study the ion fluxes we used the fact that the ratio between 
different level populations and the total ionic density equilibrate within times determined 
by the radiative decay of the level (typically < 10-20 ns). Thus, the observed evolution of 
the level populations reflects the variations of the ionic density, ne and Te. Since (as will 
be  shown  bellow)  ne  and  Te  are  determined  from  line  widths,  intensity  ratios  and  line 
intensities of gaseous elements (whose motion is negligible), we could use the evolution 
of the observed intensities to determine the fluxes of the ions whose motion is significant.  
In  the  CR  modeling  [17]  the  time-dependent  atomic/ionic  level  populations  are 

calculated from the following system of rate equations: 

 
 

5 

( )
t
dN
dt

=

(
tNtA

)(

),

)1(

 
where N(t) is the vector of all the level populations and A(t) is the rate matrix. The 
treatment is time-dependent (the rate equation system (1) is integrated explicitly), as is 
required  for  such  highly  transient  plasmas.  The  number  of  atomic  levels  used  in  the 
calculations varies from about 10 for Hydrogen up to about 200 for the oxygen ions (OI-
IX).  The  matrix  A(t)  depends  on  time  via  the  electron  density  ne(t)  and  the  time-
dependent  EED  function.  The  basic  atomic  processes  taken  into  account  in  the  rate 
matrix are electron impact excitation and deexcitation, electron impact ionization and 3-
body 
radiative  and  dielectronic 
recombination, and charge exchange. It must be emphasized that in the present modeling 
we  use  the  energy-dependent  cross  sections  rather  than  Maxwellian-averaged  rate 
coefficients,  which  allows  for  CR  calculations  with  an  arbitrary  EED  function. This is 
essential for studying the effects of the non-Maxwellian EED in the flashboard plasma. 

recombination,  spontaneous 

radiative  decays, 

The  atomic  data  required  for  our  collisional-radiative  modeling  are  either  taken 
from existing atomic databases or newly calculated using available computational tools. 
The National Institute of Standards Atomic Spectra Database [18] is the principal source 
of energy levels and oscillator strengths; the missing values are calculated with Cowan’s 
Hartree-Fock  relativistic  atomic  structure  package  [19] 
including  configuration 
interaction  and  intermediate  coupling.  Since  the  available  data  on  the  electron  impact 
excitation are rather limited, most cross sections are calculated with the Coulomb-Born-
exchange  code  ATOM  [20].  The  excitation cross sections are mainly calculated in LS-
coupling  although,  when  necessary,  other  types  of  couplings  are  utilized  (for  example, 
jK-coupling  for  ArI).  To  improve  the  accuracy  of  dipole-allowed  excitation  cross 
sections,  they  are  rescaled  by  the  ratio  between  a  more  accurate  oscillator  strength, 
calculated by other methods (e.g., multi-configuration Hartree-Fock), and that calculated 
by ATOM (corrections are typically <50%). For some transitions between the levels with 
close  energies  this  correction  exceeded  a  factor  of  2  (which  may  result  in  lower 
accuracy);  however,  the  absolute  magnitude  of  the  corresponding  cross  sections  is  less 
important due to fast equilibration of the relevant level populations. Comparison between 
the  rescaled  excitation  cross  sections  obtained  with  ATOM  and  available  experimental 
data shows agreement within 20-30% for ions and within 50% for neutral atoms. For H 
and HeI-II more accurate excitation cross sections, calculated with the Convergent Close-
Coupling  method  [21],  are  used  to  obtain  the  highest  possible  reliability.  The  use  of 
accurate  cross  sections  is  especially  important  when  the  electron  temperature  is  much 
smaller  than  the  excitation  threshold,  and  therefore  the  corresponding  rate  is  mainly 
determined  by  the  near-threshold  cross  section.  The  dipole-allowed  cross  sections  for 
strong two-electron transitions are computed in the Van Regemorter approximation. The 
recommended  ionization  cross  sections  for  the  ion  ground  states  [22]  are  also  used  for 
ionization from the excited states, the classical scaling  s
ion ~ I-2 being implemented for 
the  latter  (I  is  the  ionization  energy).  The  Milne  relation  [19]  is  used  to  produce  the 
radiative  recombination  cross  sections  from  the  Opacity  Project  results  [23]  for 
photoionization. The dielectronic recombination rates of Hahn [24] are used for most ions 
while  for  neutral  and  low-charge  ions  of  argon  the  Burgess-Merts-Cowan-Magee 
parameterization [19] is utilized. Finally, the cross sections for the inverse processes are 
 
 

6 

obtained  using  the  principle  of  detailed  balance  which,  although  formulated  for 
equilibrium  plasmas,  establishes  relations  between  purely  atomic  quantities,  and  thus 
these relations are independent on particular plasma conditions such as, for example, the 
electron energy distribution function. 

B. 

Electron density 

Stark  broadening  measurements  of  the  Ha   and  Hb   profiles  are  analyzed  self-
consistently to give ne and the hydrogen velocity distribution along the line of sight. In 
this  analysis,  the  Stark  broadening  is  assumed  to  mainly  result  from  the  quasistatic 
Holtzmark distribution of the ionic microfields with a small correction due to the electron 
dynamics,  treated  under  the  impact  approximation.  The  line  width  calculations  are 
performed  according  to  Ref.  [25].  The  effects  of  ion  dynamics  (negligible  for  Hb )  are 
unimportant for Ha  in this experiment due to the dominance of the Doppler broadening. 
The Doppler broadening results from the combined effect of the thermal velocity and the 
directed  velocity,  integrated  along  the  line  of  sight.  The  Ha   profiles  are  fitted  by  a 
Gaussian  which  is  in  good  agreement  with  the  observed  profiles.  Because  of  the  large 
Doppler width of the hydrogen lines the use of Stark broadening for the determination of 
the electron density is limited to ne > 1014 cm-3. The Stark broadening dependence on the 
effective  charge  of  the  ions  in  the  plasma  is  accounted  for,  based  on  the  determined 
plasma composition (see Sec. III.E). 

The electron density measurements are performed in the POS anode-cathode (A-K) 
gap which is located 3-5.5 cm from the flashboard surface. H2 and CH4 doping is used to 
determine ne locally in 3D by observing the line emission from hydrogen produced from 
the  dissociation  of  these  molecules.  Due  to  the  complex  chemistry  of  the  doped  CH4 
molecules, whose detailed modeling is beyond the scope of this work, we performed the 
measurements  using  different  densities  of  CH4  and  H2  doping  and  compared  them  to 
experiments  without  doping.  We  were  careful  to  operate  with  gas  densities  that  are 
significantly  smaller  than  the  original  plasma  density  to  minimize  the  effects  of  the 
unknown plasma chemistry.  

 The rise in the plasma electron density due to the ionization of these doped gases is 
estimated to be less than 5· 1013 cm-3 due to the low density of the injected gas (ngas < 
3· 1013  cm-3).  However,  at  t  >  1  m s  the  density  of  hydrogen  ejected  from  the  POS 
electrodes becomes comparable to that of the doped hydrogen, resulting in line-integrated 
(along the y-direction) electron density determination. 

The evolution of ne at z = 3.5, y = 0, and x = 1 and 2 cm is shown in figure 2. In 
these experiments CH4 is injected into the entire POS region by removing the skimmer. 
The spatial resolution in these measurements is – 0.2 cm along the x-direction, – 0.5 cm 
along the z-direction, and spatially averaged along the y-direction. At each position two 
traces from two different discharges are shown to indicate the reproducibility ne, found to 
be within – 10% at t > 1 m s. 

The  ratio  between  the  MgII  3p  and  3d  level  populations,  determined  from  the 
intensities of the 3s-3p and 3p-3d transitions, is used in order to study ne at times earlier 
than 800 ns (prior to the ionization of the MgII). This method relies on the fact that for 
the  densities  5· 1012  <  ne  <  5· 1014  cm-3  the  3p-3d  excitation  channel,  which  scales 
2, becomes comparable to the 3s-3d direct excitation from the ground 
approximately as ne

state,  making  the  ratio  between  the  3p  and  3d  level  populations  dependent  on  ne. 
Moreover, due to the low excitation energies of these two levels the ratio between their 
populations is insensitive to the electron temperature for Te > 10 eV. Also, these spectral 
lines  could  be  observed  in  a  single  discharge  due  to  their  similar  wavelengths, 
overcoming  the  shot-to-shot  irreproducibility.  Figure  3(a)  shows  the  time-dependent 
population ratio for these two MgII levels. Also shown is the ratio predicted by the CR 
calculations using ne from Figure 3(b) and Te(t) determined in Sec. III.D. The error bars 
on  ne  are  determined  by  the  experimental  error,  the  uncertainty  in  the  electron 
temperature,  and  by  the  uncertainties  in  the  atomic-physics  modeling.  The  larger 
uncertainties at later times result from the lower electron temperature at these times. At t 
= 800 ns ne so determined matches ne determined from Stark broadening to within – 10%.  
Figure 3(b) also shows a lower limit for ne obtained from the observed intensity of 
the ArI 6965-Å line. Here, we make use of the knowledge of the absolute density of the 
doped argon obtained from the ionization-probe array measurements [16]. By varying the 
electron  temperature  in  the  CR  calculations  as  a  free  parameter  we  searched  for  the 
minimum electron density that would match the observed line intensity evolution, based 
on the known total ArI density. The presented lower limit accounts for the uncertainties 
in the ArI gas density and the absolute calibration of the spectroscopic system.  

By determining ne at various positions in the x-z plane we constructed a 2D map of 
ne at various times. Such a map of the electron density in the x-z plane integrated over the 
y-direction at t = 1200 ns, which corresponds to the time of application of the POS high-
current  pulse,  is  shown  in  Figure  4.  The  density  minimum  at  z  =  3.5  cm  is  below  the 
contact region of the two flashboards. The density peaks at z = 1.5 and z = 5.5 cm result 
from  a  faster  plasma  expansion  at  the  ground-side  edges  of  the  flashboards.  The  lower 
density at the generator side (z = 1.5 cm) relative to the load side (z = 5.5 cm) is due to 
the  lower  current  through  the  flashboard  at  the  generator  side,  as  a  result  of  a  larger 
inductance of the cables driving that flashboard.  

The  distribution  of  ne  along  the  width  of  the  electrodes  (y-direction)  is  measured 
using observations along the z-axis, and the axially averaged electron density is observed 
to have a symmetric profile to within – 10% with a FWHM »
 12 cm. The density at the 
edges of the electrodes (along the y-direction) is found to be (1-2)· 1014 cm-3 at t = 1200 
ns. 

C.  Plasma Expansion velocity 

In  order  to  study  the  properties  of  the  proton-plasma  flowing  at  the  front  of  the 
injected  plasma,  we  observe  light  emission  from  the  doped  elements  as  they  encounter 
the proton-plasma. The velocity of the proton plasma is determined from time-of-flight 
data  obtained  by  observing  the  excitations  of  the  dopants  caused  by  the  co-moving 
plasma electrons. The velocity of the slower carbon-dominated plasma is obtained from 
the time-of-flight data of spectral lines of carbon ions without doping.  

Figure 5 shows the intensity of the doped HeI 6678-Å line at different x-positions. 
In these experiments, the POS electrodes are removed in order to avoid electrode-plasma 
effects  on  the  measurement.  The  time  delay  between  the  helium  injection  and  the 
application of the flashboard current is varied in the experiments in order to compensate 
for  the  different  travel  times  of  the  gas  to  the  various  x-positions.  The  plasma  front  is 
 
 

8 

seen  to  flow  at  a  velocity  of  (2.8– 0.5)· 107  cm/s,  followed  by  a  plasma  with  a  higher 
density and a lower velocity of (2.2– 0.5)· 107 cm/s, reaching the POS region at t = 400-
500  ns.  The  slower  rise  of  the  helium  signal  at  positions  farther  from  the  flashboard 
indicates that the velocity at which plasma leaves the vicinity of the flashboard drops in 
time.  

The  plasma  that  reaches  the  A-K  gap  300-550  ns  after  the  initiation  of  the 
flashboard  discharge  is  primarily  composed  of  protons  with  a  small  fraction  of  fast 
hydrogen. It is verified spectroscopically that the density of heavier ions such as carbon 
is negligible in this plasma front.  

In  order  to  determine  the  proton  transverse  velocity  we  observe  the  Doppler 
broadened Ha  profile in experiments without doping and without the POS electrodes in 
order  to  only  observe  the  hydrogen  originating  at  the  flashboard.  Since  only  fast 
hydrogen atoms (those produced via proton charge-exchange near the flashboard surface) 
may reach the A-K gap so early, the Ha  Doppler width should yield the proton transverse 
velocity.  

Measurements of the Ha  profile at x = 1 cm at early times (t = 400-700 ns) without 
gas  injection  and  without  POS  electrodes  show  a  constant  Doppler  profile  with  an 
average  width  that  corresponds  to  a  velocity  of  (3.5– 0.5)· 106  cm/s  in  the  y-direction. 
Comparing this velocity to the proton propagation velocity, obtained from time-of-flight, 
one can obtain the divergence angle of the plasma, found to vary from – (7– 1.5)o at t = 
320– 40 ns to – (10– 2)o at t = 450– 50 ns and to – (13– 2.5)o at t = 700– 50 ns.  

Time-of-flight  measurements  of  the  CIII  2297-Å  line  without  the  POS  electrodes 
showed a front propagating at a velocity of (7– 2)· 106 cm/s, reaching the A-K gap at t »
 
800  ns.  This  is  followed  by  CIII  with  a  higher  density  propagating  at  a  velocity  of 
(5– 1)· 106 cm/s. The profile of this line indicated an average transverse velocity dropping 
from (2.4– 0.3)· 106 cm/s for the front of the CIII plasma to (1.7– 0.2)· 106 cm/s for the 
peak CIII density. The propagation velocity together with the transverse velocity yield a 
divergence angle of – (20– 8)o for the CIII plasma. 

D.  Electron Temperature 

The  electron  temperature  is  determined  as  a  function  of  time  from  the  temporal 
evolution of absolute light intensities. To this end, the different effects that can affect the 
observed line intensities, such as variations of the ion or atom densities due to particle 
flow  and  ionization  and  the  temporal  variation  of  ne,  had  to  be  considered.  Here,  by 
doping gaseous materials with injection velocities of the order of 105 cm/s, we are able to 
minimize the effect of the flow. Using dopants with different ionization rates, it is also 
possible to study the effects of ionization.  

The behavior of the HeI 1s3d 1D level and the HeII n=4 level are modeled with the 
aid of CR calculations using the measured electron density (see Sec. III.B). Figure 6(a) 
shows the temporal evolution of these level populations, determined from the 6678-Å and 
the  4686-Å  line  intensities.  The  time-dependent  electron  temperature  is  determined  by 
fitting  the  CR-code  predictions  for  these  level  populations  to  the  data.  The  modeling 
shown in Figure 6(a) is obtained using the electron temperature shown in Figure 6(b).  

 
 

9 

The modeling shows that the drop of the HeI 1s3d  1D population seen at t > 1 m s 
cannot result from ionization, due to the relatively low electron temperature at that time, 
indicating that this drop must occur due to a drop in Te as shown in Figure 6(b). 

The electron temperature at t = 600-800 ns is also obtained from the absolute line 
intensity and knowledge of the density of the injected gas [16]. The absolute intensity of 
the  HeI  6678-Å  line  shows  that  the  electron  temperature  is  11– 2  eV  at  t  =  700  ns. 
Because  the  ionization  of  HeI  is  small,  the  obtained  electron  temperature  time-
dependence is unique, since the HeI 1s3d  1D level population is mainly affected by the 
variation  of  the  excitation  rates  due  to  changes  in  the  electron  temperature  (ne(t)  is 
known).  

A similar analysis is carried out for argon by measuring the temporal evolution of 
the ArI 6965-Å, ArII 4348-Å, and the ArIII 3286-Å lines. For ArI significant ionization 
occurs,  requiring  measurements  of  a  few  consecutive  charge  states  in  order to obtain a 
unique  time  dependence  for  the  electron  temperature.  Figure  7(a)  shows  the  temporal 
evolution  of  the  ArI  4p'[1/2]1,  ArII  3p4(3P)4p  4Do,  and  the  ArIII  3p3(4So)4p  5P  level 
populations, together with the predictions of the CR modeling. The experimental traces 
are averaged over 3 different discharges and have a temporal resolution of 20 ns. Figure 
7(b) shows the electron temperature evolution that is used in the CR modeling to obtain 
the predictions in (a). The error bars on Te mainly result from the uncertainty in ne.  

The  absolute  intensity  of  the  ArI  6965-Å  line  together  with  knowledge  of  the 
injected argon density show that Te = 14– 2 eV at t = 550 ns. We also determined Te from 
the observed ionization time of CI produced from the disassociation of doped CH4. We 
assume  that  the  drop  observed  in  the  CI  intensity  at  t  >  900  ns  results  from  ionization 
after  the  replenishing  of  neutral  carbon  through  the  various  disassociation  channels  of 
CH4  is  finished.  This  assumption  does  not  depend  on  a  detailed  knowledge  of  the 
chemistry  of  the  CH4  molecules  and  the  resulting  disassociation.  This  measurement  is 
only performed at x = 1 cm, since in this position the line intensity of CI without the CH4 
doping is negligible. The ionization of CI at t = 900-1100 ns yields Te = 8– 1.5 eV. 

The density of the doped Ar, He, and CH4 is varied from » 2· 1013 to » 1014 cm-3 in 
order to examine whether the gas doping caused cooling of the plasma electrons. For the 
low densities of doped He, the plasma electrons are found to cool by <<1 eV. However, 
for Ar and CH4 doping the plasma electrons are found to cool by up to 2 eV (for a doped 
density of 1014 cm-3) resulting in an underestimate of Te. 

A  summary  of  the  electron  temperature  obtained  using  the  temporal  evolution  of 
the helium and argon line intensities, the absolute intensities of helium and argon and the 
ionization time of CI, together with the error bars for x = 1 cm and z = 3.5 cm, is shown 
in Figure 8. Te is thus found to be 9– 1.5 eV until t »
 1.0 m s, followed by a nearly linear 
 1.6 m s. Furthermore, the temperature at t = 1.2 m s (the time of 
drop to 5.0– 0.5 eV at t ‡

Close  to  the  generator-side  edge  of  the  plasma  at  z  =  -0.3  cm  the  electron 
temperature at t = 1.2 m s is found to be lower than at z = 3.5 cm, x = 1 cm. This seems to 
occur due to enhanced electron cooling caused by the solid anode surface at z < 0.

Also shown in Figure 8 is the electron temperature evolution determined using the 
temporal behavior of the HeI 1s3d  1D and the HeII n=4 spectral lines without the POS 
electrodes  in  place.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  electron  temperature  without  the  POS 
electrodes in place is higher by » 1 eV until t = 0.9 m s and by » 2.5 eV at later times. The 
electron density at x = 1 cm is determined to be unaffected by the removal of the POS 
electrodes to within the accuracy of the measurement.  

The  determination  of  the  electron  temperature  in  present  work  was  carried  out 
assuming  an  equilibrium  Maxwellian  electron  energy  distribution.  Nonetheless,  it  is 
known  that  in  highly-transient  plasmas  of  high-current  discharges  there  may  exist 
deviations  from  a  Maxwellian  EED  [26],  often  in  a  form  of  an  excess  of  high-energy 
electrons. The effect of the overpopulated tail of the electron energy distribution function, 
which is normally negligible for atomic processes with small energy thresholds D E (D E < 
Te),  can  manifest  itself  especially  in  anomalous  behavior  of  the  highly-excited  levels. 
This seems to be the case for the measured CIV lines, which originate from high lying 
levels (see Table 1). We were not able to consistently describe the absolute intensities of 
the CIV spectral lines with only a Maxwellian EED function, whereas an addition of a 
few percent of hot electrons (50-100 eV) resolved the discrepancy between modeling and 
measurements. We plan to address the issue of non-Maxwellian effects in the flashboard 
and POS plasmas in a separate publication. 

Such a small deviation from a Maxwellian description of the plasma electrons does 
not devaluate the above-described quantitative determination of the electron temperature 
since  it  is  obtained  from  emissions  of  low  lying  levels  (11-23  eV)  for  which  the 
contribution  of  the  Maxwellian  electrons  overwhelms  that  of  the  deviation.  Thus,  Te 
serves as a measure of the mean electron energy in the flashboard plasma. 

E. 

Plasma composition 

The plasma composition is determined from the observed light intensities and the 
known electron density and temperature. The total densities of HI, CI, CII, CIII, OII, and 
OIII  are  thus  obtained  from  the  intensities  of  the  6563,  2479,  2837,  2297,  4349,  and 
3047-Å lines, respectively. The effects of charge-exchange with neutral hydrogen on the 
observed lines of CII, CIII, OII, and OIII are estimated and found to be negligible. 

This modeling in which the EED is assumed to be Maxwellian, yielded, however, 
unreasonably high densities for CIV. One possibility to explain these line intensities is to 
assume the presence of non-Maxwellian energetic electrons (as described in the previous 
section). It is estimated that a few percent of 50-100 eV electrons are enough for such an 
explanation.  The  other  possibility  is  that  the  high  CIV  line  intensities  are  caused  by 
charge-exchange processes between CV and H resulting in selective population of some 
of the CIV levels.  

 The CV density could not be determined using line emissions from CV since no 
emission  from  CV  lines  was  detected  because  the  upper  levels  of  all  observable 
transitions are >300 eV above the ground state. 

To examine the effect of charge-exchange on the CIV 5801 and 2530 Å lines we 
performed experiments with a hydrogen density varying from 3· 1012 cm-3 (by removing 
the POS electrodes and using no doping) to 1.5· 1014 cm-3 (keeping the POS electrodes in 
place and using H2 doping) and observed the change in the CIV line intensities.  
 
 

11 

In  the  first  configuration,  in  which  the  hydrogen  density  is  too  low  for  charge-
exchange  to  contribute  significantly  to  the  level  populations,  are  used  to  determine  the 
density of CIV from CR calculations. It is important to note that since the CIV and CV 
originate at the flashboard (as described in Sec. III.F) their density is not affected by the 
removal of the POS electrodes. 

In the experiments with H2 doping the relative velocity between the hydrogen and 
CV,  required  for  the  charge-exchange  modeling,  is  obtained  from  the  flow  velocity  of 
CV,  found  to  be  (5– 1)· 106  cm/s  (the  doped  hydrogen  is  slow).  The  hydrogen  density 
determined  from  the  Ha   intensity  and  the  state-selective  cross  sections  for  the  charge 
exchange [27,28] are then used to determine the density of CV.  

The large uncertainty in the CV density mainly results from the uncertainty in the 
impact velocity and the resulting error of the state-selective charge exchange into the 3p 
level,  which  drops  very  sharply  at  low  impact  velocities,  as  the  dominant  channel  for 
charge  exchange  becomes  the  3d  level  [27]  (the  charge  exchange  into  the  3d  level  has 
nearly  no  effect  on  the  3p  population  since  the  3d  level  radiatively  decays  to  the  2p 
level).  A  second  uncertainty  in  the  CV  density  results  from  the  uncertainty  in  the  H2 
density.  The  cross  section  for  charge  exchange  with  these molecules is higher than the 
cross  section  with  hydrogen  atoms,  especially  at  low  velocities  where  the  3p  level 
remains the dominant channel of charge exchange with H2 [29].  

A  lower  limit  for  the  CIV  density  can  be  obtained  from  the  level  populations 
observed during the POS operation when the electron temperature is found to rise [30] 
and  the  CIV  level  populations  become  dominated  by  electron  excitation  rather  than  by 
charge  exchange  processes.  By  taking  the  optimum  excitation  rates  in  the  CR 
calculations, this analysis results in a lower limit for the CIV density, giving for t = 1.2 
m s (6– 1.5)· 1013 and (2– 0.5)· 1013 cm-3 at x = 2.2 and x = 1 cm, respectively. An upper 
bound  for  the  CIV  density  is  the  measured  electron  density  and  the  requirement  for 
charge neutrality. 

Measurements  also  show  that  the  density  of  other  heavier  elements  such  as  iron, 
copper, and aluminum are negligibly small except at a distance less than 1 mm from the 
electrode  surfaces.  This  results  from  the  low  flow  velocity  of  these  ions  into  the  POS 
region. Near the POS electrodes, however, heavy impurities, desorbed from the surfaces 
due to the impact of the primary flashboard plasma, are found to make up a few percent 
of the plasma density. 

The  determination  of  the  densities  of  most  of  the  plasma  constituents  allows  the 
proton  density  to  be  obtained  from  the  balance  between  ne  and  the  total  non-protonic 
ionic charge. However, due to the large uncertainty in the density of CIV and CV there is 
a significant uncertainty in the proton density.  

Table II summarizes the plasma composition at x = 1 (the middle of the A-K gap) 
and x = 2.2 cm (near the anode) for z = 3.5 cm (the axial center of the POS) integrated 
along  the  y-direction.  The  composition  is  for  the  time  1.2  m s  after  the  start  of  the 
flashboard current pulse. 

F.  Origin of the various plasma constituents 

Measurements  with  and  without  the  electrodes  are  used  to  distinguish  between 
plasmas  produced  by  the  flashboard  and  secondary  plasmas  originating  from  the  POS 
 
 

12 

electrodes.  The  electron  density  and  temperature,  required  for  the  CR  modeling  of  the 
observed line intensities, are determined for both configurations. The electron density is 
found to be approximately the same while the electron temperature is found to be higher 
at t > 0.9 m s if the POS electrodes are removed (see Figure 8).  

In  experiments  with the POS electrodes, the observed intensity of Ha  is found to 
increase by more than an order of magnitude as a result of hydrogen originating from the 
electrode  surfaces.  Comparison  of  the  hydrogen  density  near  the  anode  and  cathode 
shows that the hydrogen density emanating from the anode is approximately two times 
higher  than  that  from  the  cathode.  In  experiments  with  the  POS  electrodes  (without 
doping)  the  Doppler-dominated  Ha   width  at  t  =  600-900  ns  is  found  to  depend  on  the 
location  of  the  observation.  In  the  middle  of  the  A-K  gap  (x  =  1  cm)  Ha   has  a  broad 
profile  corresponding  to  an  average  hydrogen  velocity  of  (4.5– 0.3)· 106  cm/s  in  the  y-
direction. Experiments near the anode (x = 2 cm) show a narrow profile with an average 
velocity  in  the  y-direction  of  only  (2.5– 0.3)· 106  cm/s.  This  data  can  be  interpreted  by 
assuming  an  injection  of  fast  and  slow  hydrogen  from  the  electrodes  with  a  large 
divergence angle (– 45o). As a result, the fast hydrogen reaches the middle of the A-K gap 
at t = 600 – 900 ns, whereas the denser and slower hydrogen only reaches the x = 2 cm 
position and the x=0.5 cm for hydrogen ejected from the cathode. 

The density of CII and CIII at x = 2 cm is found to be approximately the same for 
the  two  configurations  until  t  »
  1  m s,  after  which  the  density  of  these  ions  increases 
sharply in the configuration with the electrodes and becomes about 6 times higher than 
without electrodes at t = 1.2 m s. A similar increase is also seen near the cathode (x = 0.3 
cm). This means that most of the high density carbon plasma near the anode and cathode 
originates from the electrode wires rather than from the flashboard. However, unlike CII, 
CIII, and hydrogen, we may conclude that CIV and CV originate at the flashboard, since 
the temperature in the anode-cathode gap is too low to ionize CIII originating from the 
electrodes within » 1 m s. 

IV.  Summary and Discussion 

Plasma doping with various gaseous materials allows for studying many properties 
of the flashboard-generated plasma. Both Stark broadening of hydrogen lines and spectral 
line ratios of MgII are used to determine the evolution of ne. The agreement between the 
two  methods  at  t  =  800  ns  is  within – 10%.  The  measurement  of  spectral  line  ratios  of 
MgII also allows for accurate determination of the temporal evolution of ne for electron 
densities as low as 1· 1013 cm-3. At the time at which the POS is operated ne is found to 
vary between 3· 1014 cm-3 near the cathode to 7· 1014 cm-3 near the anode. 

The  electron  temperature  of  the  expanding  flashboard  plasma  at  x  =  1  cm, 
determined from the temporal evolution of different doped-species spectral lines, is found 
to drop from 18– 3 eV at t = 500 ns to 10.5– 1.5 eV at t = 800 ns and to  6 5 1
+
eV at t = 
0 5
.
1.2 m s. In experiments in which the POS electrodes are removed, the drop of the electron 
temperature is slower and an electron temperature of 10– 1 eV is found at x = 1 cm at t = 
1.2 m s (see Figure 8). The difference between the two configurations is explained by the 
cooling of the plasma due to the interaction with the electrodes.

As  mentioned  in  Sec.  III.D,  the  EED  in  our  plasma  seems  to  deviate  from  a 
Maxwellian  one,  with  an  excess  of  high-energy  (~  50-100  eV)  electrons.  We  estimate 
that electrons with an energy of 100 eV have a mean free path of 1-3 cm for electron-
electron collisions for an electron density of (1-3)· 1015 cm-3 (this density is taken as the 
average electron density in the region between the flashboard and the POS, i.e., x > 2.6 
cm). Thus, high-energy electrons produced near the flashboard may reach the POS region 
without thermalization, giving rise to the deviation of the EED from a Maxwellian.  

The  relatively  high  accuracy  in  the  determination  of  ne  and  Te  allows  for  a 
reasonably reliable determination of the plasma composition. To this end, the effects of 
charge exchange processes on the line intensities are accounted for. It is shown that the 
possible presence of non-thermal electrons with energies above 50 eV mainly affects the 
uncertainty  in  the  determination  of  the  CIV  density.  In  the  center  of  the  A-K  gap  the 
plasma is shown to consist of CIV with lower densities of CII, CIII, and CV. Hydrogen is 
found to be the only neutral element with a significant density (<10% of ne). The proton 
density determined from the balance between ne and the total non-protonic ionic charge 
has  a  large  uncertainty  due  to  the  relatively  large  uncertainty  in  the  CIV  and  CV 
densities. The density of oxygen ions is 3 - 10 times lower than that of carbon ions and 
the density of heavier ions (such as SiII, FeII, and NiII) are estimated to be less than 1012 
cm-3. This work demonstrates the need for detailed CR modeling in order to avoid large 
errors in the determination of the electron temperature and plasma composition. 

 By  combining 

the  electron  density  measurements  with 

time-of-flight 
measurements and with the knowledge of the plasma composition it is possible to study 
the velocity and origin of the various plasma constituents. Here, we make the distinction 
between  four  different  plasmas.  The  first  plasma  consists  of  protons  traveling  at  a 
velocity  up  to  (2.8– 0.3)· 107  cm/s  and  with  a  density  less  than  1· 1013  cm-3.  This  is 
followed  by  a  slower  and  more  dense  proton  plasma  with  a  propagation  velocity  of 
(2.1– 0.3)· 107  cm/s  and  a  density  of  2– 1· 1013  cm-3.  The  protons  in  both  plasmas  are 
found to have a very low divergence angle – (7-13)o. The third plasma is found to mainly 
consist of carbon ions and protons with smaller concentrations of hydrogen, oxygen and 
silicon ions. The electron density of this plasma increases from 1014 cm-3 to >1015 cm-3 in 
the A-K gap. The most abundant charge state of the carbon ions in this plasma is CIV.  

The fourth plasma originates at the POS electrodes as a result of the bombardment 
by the proton plasmas. This plasma mainly consists of hydrogen, CII, CIII, and smaller 
contributions of OII and OIII and contributes most of these species in the A-K gap as is 
found  by  comparison  between  experiments  with  and  without  the  POS  electrodes.  The 
carbon ions originating at the electrodes have an expansion velocity of (2– 0.5)· 106 cm/s, 
thus  they  are  confined  to  a  region  <  1  cm  from  the  electrodes  at  the  time  the  POS  is 
operated. This is also correct for most of the hydrogen ejected from the electrodes that 
has  an  expansion  velocity  of  (1.5– 0.5)· 106  cm/s.  However,  approximately  20%  of  the 
hydrogen travels at a higher expansion velocity, (3-5)· 106 cm/s, thus filling the entire A-
K gap at the time the POS is operated. 

In our configuration, the effect of plasma ejection from the electrodes on ne is small 
since the electrodes consist of wires with a 94% transparency and the time delay between 
the  creation  of  the  electrode  plasmas  and  the  POS  operation  is  small.  This  is  also  the 
reason  why  in  our  configuration  the  most  abundant  carbon  species  is  CIV,  which 
originates  at  the  flashboard.  In  another  configuration  used  earlier,  in  which  a  solid 

 
 

14 

cathode  was  used  (rather  than  highly  transparent)  and  the  time  delay  between  the 
flashboard  discharge  and  the  POS  operation  was  longer,  the  density  of  the  secondary 
electrode plasma in the A-K gap was higher than that of the flashboard plasma. One may, 
therefore,  suggest  that  in  other  experiments  [31,32],  in  which  low-transparency  POS 
electrodes  are  used  and  the  time  delay  between  the  flashboard  discharge  and  the  POS 
operation is longer the effect of electrode plasmas is more important. This may influence 
the  plasma  composition  (more  ions  with  lower  charge  states),  the  electron  temperature 
(lower Te) and electron density (higher ne) in most of the A-K. 

These results demonstrate that the properties of the prefilled plasma used in pulsed-
power  experiments,  besides  being  influenced  by  the  plasma-source  geometry  and  the 
discharge  circuit,  can  be  highly  affected  by  material  release  from  the  electrodes.  This 
effect probably depends on the flux of plasma that strikes the electrode surfaces, on the 
electrode-surface  area  and  conditions,  and  on  the  time  delay  between  the  source 
discharge and the system operation.  

Generally,  knowledge  of  the  plasma  properties,  and  in  particular  the  plasma 
composition, is highly important for understanding the device operation. We believe that 
the  diagnostic  methods  here  described  can  be  used  to  systematically  study  most  of  the 
important plasma properties in a variety of experimental conditions and geometries.

Figure  1:  Schematic  of  the  POS,  the  flashboard  plasma  sources,  the  gas-doping 
arrangements, and the spectroscopic system. The inter-electrode region of the planar POS 
is prefilled with plasma from two flashboard plasma sources. A fast gas valve, a nozzle, 
and  a  skimmer  are  used  to  locally  dope  the  plasma  with  various  species.  Lenses  and 
mirrors  are  used  to  collect  light  from  the  doped  column  into  the  spectrometer.  A 
cylindrical  lens  focuses  the  output  of  the  spectrometer  onto  a  fiber  bundle  array  that 
passes the light to 12 photomultiplier tubes. 

Figure 2: The time dependent electron density of the flashboard plasma for z = 3.5 cm 
(the  middle  of  the  plasma  in  the  z-direction),  determined  from  Stark  broadening  of 
hydrogen lines. Two traces obtained in different discharges are shown for x = 1 (near the 
middle of the A-K gap) and x = 2 cm (near the anode). 

Figure  3:  (a)  The  observed  time-dependent  ratio  of  the  MgII  3p  2Po  and  3d  2D  level 
populations  time-averaged using a 30 ns filter and averaged over three experiments. The 
measurement  is  at  x  =  1,  y  =  0,  and  z  =  3.5  cm  (the  middle  of  the  plasma  in  the  z-
direction). The oscillations visible prior to t < 500 ns are caused by the weak signal of the 
MgII  2798  Å  line  and  the  resulting  poor  photon  statistics.  Also  shown  is  the  level 
population ratio predicted by the collisional-radiative modeling. (b) The electron density 
used in the CR calculations to obtain the predicted ratio shown in (a). Also shown is ne 
obtained from Stark broadening at t ‡
 780 ns. The thick solid curve represents a lower 
limit for ne obtained from the absolute intensity of the ArI 6965-Å line. 
Figure  4:  A  two  dimensional  map  of  ne  integrated  over  the  y-direction  1.2 m s  after  the 
operation of the flashboard. The spatial resolution in these measurements is – 0.5 cm in 
the z-direction and – 0.2 cm in the x-direction, respectively. The errors are – 0.7· 1014 cm-
3. 

Figure 5: Time-of-flight measurements of the proton-plasma obtained from the HeI 6678-
Å  line  intensity  at  various  distances  from  the  flashboard  surface  in  the  middle  of  the 
plasma  in  the  z-direction.  The  results  are  averaged  along  8  cm  in  the  y-direction.  a(b) 
cm/s means a· 10b cm/s. Note that larger x-positions are closer to the flashboards.  

Figure 6: (a) The observed temporal evolution of the HeI 1s3d 1D and the HeII n=4 level 
populations  (symbols)  at  x  =  1  and  z  =  3.5  cm.  Two  traces  corresponding  to  different 
experiments are shown for HeI. Also shown (thin lines) are the best-fit level populations 
predicted by the collisional-radiative modeling using the electron temperature evolution 
shown in (b). 

Figure  7:  (a)  The  observed  temporal  evolution  of  the  ArI  4p'[1/2]1,  the  ArII  3p4(3P)4p 
4Do, and the ArIII 3p3(4So) 4p  5P level populations (symbols). The results are averaged 
over 3 cm along the y-direction, at x = 1 and z = 3.5 cm. Also shown (thin lines) are the 

 
 

18 

level populations predicted by the CR modeling. (b) The electron temperature evolution 
used in the CR code to obtain the curves shown in (a). 

Figure 8: The temporal evolution of the electron temperature at x = 1, y = 0, z = 3.5 cm 
obtained using the various methods discussed in the text. Also shown is the evolution of 
Te with no POS electrodes.

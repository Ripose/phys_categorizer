Abstract 

The  electrical  double  layer  at  infinite  flat  solid  surface  has  been  discussed  with  respect  to 

boundary conditions based on potential and electric displacement, respectively. It was shown that 

the electrokinetic charge density is equal to the sum of the surface charge density and the charge 

densities at the inner and the outer Helmholtz planes. The ratio of the charge density at the outer 

Helmholtz  plane  to  the  surface  charge  density  was  evaluated,  and  a  new  relation  between  the 

surface charge density and the zeta potential was derived.

1. Introduction 

  Understanding  phenomena  near  the  interface  of  solid  and  an  electrolyte  solution  is  of 

importance  in  electrokinetics,  microfluidics,  colloidal  dispersion,  and  electrochemistry.  When 

solid  surface  contacts  an  electrolyte  solution,  the  solid  surface  becomes  charged  due  to  the 

difference  of  electron  (or  ion)  affinities  between  the  solid  surface  and  the  solution  or  the 

ionization  of  surface  groups.  In  addition,  the  surface  charges  cause  a  special  structure  at  the 

interface, so called the electrical double layer (EDL) [1-5].  

  Usually  Gouy-Chapman-Stern  model  (GCS)  is  widely  used  to  describe  the  EDL.  The  GCS 

model consists of two layers; Stern layer (or Helmholtz region) and diffuse layer. The Stern layer 

is  the  region  next  to  the  surface  where  ions  in  the  solution  cannot  move  in  the  longitudinal 

direction  of  the  surface  due  to  specially-adsorbing  and  Coulomb  interactions  [6].  The  diffuse 

layer is the region next to the Stern layer. In the diffuse layer, ions in the solution can move freely 

in any direction. The Stern layer has two planes; the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and the outer 

Helmholtz plane (OHP) as shown in Figure 1a. In general, the charge densities and the potentials 

at the surface and the IHP are evaluated through equilibrium constants of surface reactions, and 

they  affect  the  charge  density  and  the  potential  at  the  OHP.  Since  the  equilibrium  constants 

involve  ion  concentrations  in the  solution,  the  charge  densities  and  the  potentials  at  the  surface 

and two planes depend on the ion concentrations in the solution [7-10].  

 

From  the  electrokinetics  point  of  view,  potential  related  to  the  interface  is  named  zeta 

potential.  The  zeta  potential  is  the  potential  at  shear  plane  within  which  the  motion  of  fluid  is 

stationary. However, the zeta potential is assumed to be the potential at the OHP since the shear 

plane lies very close to the OHP [1]. The zeta potential is measured by electroosmotic mobility, 

streaming  potential,  and  electrophoresis  [1,3].  These  measurements  are  related  directly  to  the 

diffuse layer. The electrokinetic charge amount corresponds to total charge amount in the diffuse 

layer [1], and it is expressed with respect to the zeta potential.  

2 

 

In  this  note, we  will  discuss  the  EDL  with  respect  to  boundary conditions  and  drive  a  new 

relation between the surface charge density and the zeta potential.  

2. Electrical double layer 

 

Let’s consider infinite flat solid surface in contact with an electrolyte solution. Thus, physical 

quantities such as potential, ion distribution, and electric displacement are dependent on only one-

dimensional coordinate. Figure 1a shows a detailed schematic diagram of the EDL. As mentioned 

before, it consists of the Stern layer and the diffuse layer. To easily understand the structure of the 

EDL,  we  introduce  three  types  of  ions  in  the  solution;  potential-determining,  specifically-

adsorbed and indifferent ions [6]. Potential-determining ions are adsorbed at the surface directly. 

Their  equilibrium  distribution  between  the  surface  and  the  solution  determines  the  surface 

potential relative to potential in bulk solution. The adsorbed potential-determining ions form the 

surface charge density 

0σ . Indifferent ions are affected by Coulomb force of the surface charge. 

Thus, they are repelled by the same sign surface charges while they are attracted by the opposite 

sign.  Specifically-adsorbed  ions  are  strongly  interacted  with the  surface  through  all  interactions 

other  than  purely  Coulomb  force  [6].  By  the  definition  of  ion  types,  the  IHP  is  located  at  the 

center of specifically-adsorbed ions and the OHP is located at the center of indifferent ions. As a 

matter of fact, an ion can be indifferent or specifically-adsorbed since the definition of the types 

does not depend on what it is but on where it is. It is commonly assumed that there is no charge 

between  the  surface  and  the  IHP  and  between  the  IHP  and  the  OHP.  Since  the  surface  charge 

density  and  the  charge  density  at  the  IHP  are  determined  by  equilibrium  constants  of  chemical 

reactions [7-10] and we are interested in the relation between the charge density at the OHP and 

the zeta potential, we  merge the surface and the IHP into a surface  [10]. Thus, simplified  EDL 

consists  of  the  surface,  the  OHP  and  the  diffuse  layer  as  shown  in  Fig.  1b.  Using  Gauss’  law 

gives a modified surface charge density

where 

iψ  is the potential at the IHP. It is noted that this simplification does not affect our result. 

Since there is no ion between the surface and the OHP, potential in the Stern layer satisfies

If  we  use  the  surface  potential  and  the  zeta  potential  as  the  potentials  at  the  boundaries  of  the

where δ is position of the OHP and ζ  is the zeta potential. Here, it is assumed that the potential 

at the OHP is the zeta potential ζ  as mentioned before.  To obtain potential profile in the diffuse 

layer, we use Poisson-Boltzmann equation for a 1 – 1 electrolyte [11];

zero.  The  potential  profiles  in  the  Stern  layer  and  the  diffuse  layer  are  obtained  through  the 

boundary  condition  based  on  potential.  However,  boundary  condition  based  on  electric 

displacement can be used. The boundary conditions of the electric displacement at the surface and 

at the OHP (refer to Figure 1b.) are given by

1ε  and 

bε  are  dielectric 

constants  in  the  Stern  layer  and  in  the diffuse  layer,  respectively.  The  dielectric  constant  in  the 

Stern  layer  is  different  from  that  in  the  diffuse  layer,  and  the  dielectric  constant  in  the  diffuse 

layer  is  thought  of  as  the dielectric  constant  of  bulk water  (77.78 at  300K).  Combining  Eq. (4) 

with Eqs. (7) and (8) gives

It is worthy noting that Eq. (9) is different from relations in literatures [1-4, 6-10]. The term on 

the left hand side of Eq. (9) in the literatures is only the charge density at the OHP or only the 

negative surface charge density instead of the sum of the surface charge density and the charge 

density at the OHP.  

In addition, Eq. (9) is not compatible with electroneutrality condition [6]:

  . 

(10) 

That is to say, if the electroneutrality condition is right, the electric displacement at the OHP is 

zero,  which  is  not  zero  experimentally.  Although  the  electroneutrality  condition  is  commonly 

used, it is not appropriate for the EDL since the electric displacement at the OHP in the diffuse 

layer is not zero. To assure Eq. (9), we derive it again with Gauss’ law;

where 

xD  is  the  electric  displacement  and

Eq. (13) is exactly the same as Eq. (9). In both of Eq. (9) and Eq. (13), we assume that electric 

displacement inside solid is zero. As well, when a = 0 and b is infinite, i.e., in bulk region, Eq. 

(12) becomes

electrical  neutrality  condition.  However,  this  global  electrical  neutrality  condition  needs 

modifying when charges exist inside the solid.  

3. Charge density at the outer Helmhotz plane 

 

If the sign of the surface charge is the same as that of the zeta potential, the charge amount at 

the OHP is equal to or less than the surface charge amount, i.e., 

d σσ ≤
s

 [12]. Let’s use a new 

notation, 

σγσ −=

 where

Since the OHP is not movable in the normal direction of the surface, the sum of Coulomb force 

per area between the surface charges and the charges at the OHP, electrostriction pressure of the 

fluid in the Stern layer and pressure of the fluid in the diffuse layer is zero. The Coulomb force 

between the surface charge and the charge at the OHP is

Since  there  is  no  pressure-driven  flow  in  the  diffusion  layer,  the  pressure  in  the  diffusion 

layer is constant and it is field-free pressure in bulk region. Thus we assume that the pressure in 

the diffusion layer is equal to the field-free pressure 

0P .  

 

In order that the OHP does not move in the normal direction of the surface, the pressure of 

the fluid in the Stern layer, Eq. (20), is equal to the sum of the Coulomb force per area, Eq. (15) 

and the field-free pressure in the diffusion layer;

Figure  2  shows  the  dielectric  constant  in  the  Stern  layer  as  a  function  of  the  surface  charge 

density.  The  dielectric  constant  of  water  is  numerically  calculated  by  using  Eq.  (17)  and 

E =

.  It  is  shown  in  Fig.  2  that  the  dielectric  constant  in  the  Stern  layer  decreases 

rapidly in 10 – 20 µm/cm2 surface charge density range.  Figure 3 shows the dependence of the 

ratio γ of the charge amount at OHP to the surface charge amount on the surface charge density. 

It shows clearly that the ratio is less than unity and it increases with the surface charge density.  

  

Finally, The ratio γ is also experimentally determined by the zeta potential and the surface 

charge measurements [6,15]. Combining Eqs. (6) and (13) yields

Equation  (24)  is  a  relation  between  the  surface  charge  density  and  the  zeta  potential.  As 

mentioned  before,  the  term  on  the  right  hand  side  is  the  electrokinetic  charge  density.  The 

8 

difference  between  the  surface  charge  density  and  the  electrokinetic  charge  density  gets  bigger 

 

The boundary conditions based on electric displacement was taken into consideration in the 

discussion of the electrical double layer. It was shown that the electrokinetic charge density is the 

sum  of  the  surface  charge  density  and  the  charge  density  at  the  outer  Helmholtz  plane  in  the 

simplified electrical double layer. A new relation between the surface charge density and the zeta 

with increasing the ratio γ.

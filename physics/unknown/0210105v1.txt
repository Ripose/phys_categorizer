ABSTRACT

Heterogeneous nucleation on catalytic surfaces plunged into a fluid is described through a stochastic

model.  To  generate  this  non-equilibrium  process  we  assume  that  the  turn  on  of  a  electrostatic

potential triggers a complex dynamics that includes a free Brownian motion, a reaction kinetic and a

stimulated migration before the final adhesion of ions on the surface (electrode). At  t = 0 , when the

potential is switched on, the spatial symmetry is broken and a two-stage process is developed. First

the ion undergoes a change in its electrochemical character (at some region of the space) and then

reacts  at  some  specific  points  to  stick  together  on  the  surface.  The  continuous  addition  of  ions

develops  a  material  deposit  connected  to  the  current  transient  signals  measured  in  electrochemical

deposition  processes.  Unlike  current  models  found  in  the  literature,  this  procedure  avoids  the

computation of the area covered by the diffusion zones, allowing a formalism skill to describe equally

well  the  absorption  of  ions  by  channels  on  electrified  surfaces.  The  theory  is  applied  to    the

electrodeposition  of  nickel  on  n-silicon  and  explains  the  failure  of  standard  three-dimensional

nucleation models to reproduce situations where interfacial relations control the dynamics. It is shown

that, processes dominated by chemical reactions on the electrode can not be classified as possessing

an  exclusively  instantaneous  or  progressive  character,  rather,  they  mix  together  these  two  limiting

forms of nuclei activation to defines the current transients in its beginning.

I -  INTRODUCTION

              Nucleation and growth of deposits into well-localized regions of the space, like surfaces

plunged  inside  an  initially  homogeneous  medium,  is  nowadays  a  very  important  subject  of  academic

research.  In fact there is a great number of theoretical models describing the current transient occurring

in electrochemical deposition events1-7. In most cases they are originated as improvements to the original

work of Sharifker-Hills1 (SH) that centralize  its attention  in two  points: the  ion  regular  diffusion  near  the

electrode  surface  and  a  scheme  to  compute  the  time  evolution  of  the  effective  reaction  area  on  the

material deposit surface. As consequence the models differs, basically, in the way the effective reaction

area  is  described  after  the  “overlap”  of  the  three-dimensional  diffusional  fields,  during  the  nucleus’

evolution.  This  kind  of  approach,  which  we  call  standard  approach  from  now  on,  is  charged  by  two

problems: i) the emphasis to estimate (in a too high level) the geometric form of the deposits, without an

adequate  mode  to  address  it  and,  ii)  the  persistence  to  handle  of  exclusively  diffusion  dominated

electrodeposition  processes.  In  effect,  in  these  models  it  is  generally  accepted  that  the  nucleus  growth

following the diffusional fields’ behavior that starts under a hemispherical diffusion control and evolves up

to a linear diffusion control (after the complete “overlap” of the individual nucleus). Notwithstanding, these

assumption  concerns  to  a  model  (an  intellectual,  immaterial  conception)  and  they  are  not  in

correspondence with reality. In fact, many experiments has revealed material depositions that show some

roughness that grows up until some ten or hundred Angstroms, from bottom to top, when semi-conductor

electrodes are used8. In these cases the time evolution do not show a surface softness. In a similar way,

it  is  not  possible  to  conceive  that  all  electrochemical  deposition  process  is,  exclusively,  controlled  by

diffusion.  A  diffusion-controlled  process  implies  in  a  deposition  that  develops  at  reaction  rates  (on  the

deposit’s surface), infinitely high that those related to the concentration changes. It is well known that, not

only  the  reaction  rates  on  the  catalytic  surfaces  can  be  modified  in  order  to  get  a  slow  dynamic  (and

becoming  the  dominant  process)  but  also  that,  the  matter  transport  (diffusion)  could  be  changed  by

enhancement of electrical and/or chemical effects. It is not difficult to conceive that these enhancements

can  originates  convective  movement  and  also  selective  reactions  that  include  the  discerned  ions.    The

3

standard  approach  has  given  excellent  results  but  the  obsession  to  work  with  just  one  model  could

induce  to  severe  prejudice.  In  this  case  it  postpone  some  questions  that  claim  for  consideration  every

time electrodeposition is described, as example: a) the inappropriate usage of the double normalization

procedure  (current,  time)  to  consider  potentiostatic  current  transients;  b)  the  search  for  a  necessary

connection  between  the  potentiostatic  current  transients  and  the  cyclic  voltamogram  identified  to  the

same system; c) the way to consider the effect of a chemical potential modification following the inclusion

of some composites in solution; how change the current transients and the deposit’s morphology?; d) the

way to introduce, in the descriptive equations,   the surface characteristic (composition and preparation),

in  order  to  evaluate    the  current  transient  behavior  associated  to  physic  and  chemical  surface’s

proprieties?;  e)  it  is  possible  to  include  a  way  to  estimate  the  reactive  power  of  the  catalytic  surface

following some component’s inclusion?; etc.

              In this work we start this program through the derivation of analytic expressions describing the

current transient curves measured in electrochemical deposition processes on semiconductor electrodes.

We  focus  attention  in  a  regime  controlled  by  chemical  reactions,  instead  of  a  diffusion  controlled  one,

developing  a  effort  to  avoid  the  computation  of  the  effective  reacting  area  and  the  geometry  of  the

deposits in its early stage. We use a two-step model recently introduced9, 10 and schematically indicated

in Figure 1 that sketches the near electrode region, inside an electrolytic cell.  We realize that, at distant

positions  (greater  than  some  cents  of  a  micron)  from  the  electrode,  the  hydrated  ion  is  assumed  to

perform a Brownian motion. Closer to the electrode (on the first reaction hemisphere indicated in Figure

1),  the  Brownian  particle  feels  the  effect  of  a  field  that  changes  its  electrochemical  character.  The

important point in this transformation is to account for a change in the ions dynamic. The details and the

precise nature of this modification are not relevant to the model. After this reaction, the transformed ion,

turns to be very sensitive to the field generated near the electrified plane. Then (inside region II in Fig. 1),

the ion migrates to the plane where it is reduced before its adsorption on localized points (the nuclei). As

consequence of the continuous adhesion of ions, a material deposit grows in close connection to the flux

of charges used to reduce the ions.

               Following  the  schema  devised  in  Figure  1,  we  have  to  work  with  a  solution  obeying  different

conditions in space. In this sense we adopt the two step course: (1) we obtain the flux of ions,  j R t

, ) ,

h (

, )
through the first reaction hemisphere and, (2) we derive the probability,  p r t

, that an ion, which is

d (

¢
inside the region II, arrives at a nucleus where it is reduced. The knowledge of these two factors gives us

the current density on the electrode or, what is equivalent, the growth rate of the deposit, which reads:

where  I  represents the measured current density.

This model has received a careful introduction in two previous papers9,10  and it is suitable to discuss the

two-limit situation found in electrochemical processes; the diffusion controlled deposition and the reaction

controlled  deposition11.  In  the  first,  of  this  papers9  ,  we  have  assumed  an  infinitely  high  rate  for  ions’

transformation  on  the  first  reaction  hemisphere,  such  the  overall  dynamics  is  controlled  by  diffusion.  In

this case the results obtained by Sharifker-Hills (SH)1  becomes a particular case of the derived current

density.  A  predictable  result,  once  the  SH  model  represents  a  limit  case  for  a  diffusion-controlled

processes. It is also  verified that, under  diffusion  control,  the  progressive  and  instantaneous  nucleation

regimes  are  clearly  identified  and  related  to  the  Avrami1,2  factor  through  the  probability  p r

In  effect,  once  the  interfacial  reaction  rates  are  greater  than  the  rate  of  matter  transport,  the  slower

process (the diffusion) regulates the electronic flow. In this case the nuclei activation mechanism has a

minor significance and obey a single classification  (instantaneous or progressive)  to define the role  of

the interfacial reactions on the entire process. In Fig. 2  we show a graphic representation of the current

transient  curves  in  a  diffusion-controlled  deposition.  In  the  figure  caption,  the  left-hand  bracket  is

connected to  j R t

remarkable  the  perfect  mach  between  theoretical  (including  SH  curve)  and  experimental  results  for

t

t max

.  In  this  case  the  factor 

¢t 2   in  the  exponential  argument  (see  equation  in  the  figure  caption),

characterizes the progressive behavior for a diffusion-controlled nucleation.  Similar results are  obtained

for  instantaneous  nucleation  which,  by  its  turn,  is  characterized  by  an  exponential  argument  having  a

linear time dependence (see reference 9). Also in this case the SH results coincide with the theoretical

and experimental results in the range  t

              In  the  second  paper10,  we  change  the  boundary  conditions  on  the  first  reaction  hemisphere  in

order to consider nucleation controlled by interfacial relations. The same schema depicted by Equations

(1) and (2) is used but, the flux of ions  j R t

worked. In this case we shown that the SH curves never mach the experimental ones, attesting a model

conceived to describe the current transients under interfacial reactions control. In Fig. 3 we show a set of

curves  that  attends  for  instantaneous  nucleation  in  reaction  controlled  processes.  Once  again,  the  left-

t

the  two  limiting  curves  of  the  SH  model  as  we  will  show  during  the  analysis  of  Fig.  5.    In  spite  of  an

adequate description of the current transients in the range  t

t max

, where diffusion is important to define

the shape of the curves,  the disagreement with experimental results at the beginning of the  deposition

process,  when  t

t max

,  indicates  the  importance  of  the  nucleus  activation  mechanism  to  describe  the

current  transients.  Effectively,  under  chemical  reaction  control  the  current  transients  are  so  delicately

affected  by  the  nucleus  activation  mechanism  that  it  hardly  could  be  considered  as  just  progressive  or

instantaneous.  The  verification of this  point of view is the intention  of the present  work.  As in  the  two

previous articles9,10  we use the two-stage model drafted in Fig. 1 and explained on what follows. We also

use equation (1) to generate the current transient curves, which will be compared to experimental results

in section IV.

              To  conclude  this  introduction  we  wish  to  emphasize  the  intention  to  prove  that,  in  reaction

controlled depositions, the nuclei activation is not exclusively guided by an instantaneous or progressive

behavior but rather by a chemical kinetic that mix together the two kind of nuclei evolution in the transient

d (
regime.  To  demonstrate  this,  we  derive  a  new  expression  for  the  p r

t

  entering  into  Eq.  (1),  such

Eq. (2) is no longer valid when deposition and growth obeys an interfacial controlled kinetic.

II – THE THEORETICAL MODEL

6

              We  work  with  a  medium  where  a  great  number  of  particles  are  diluted  into  an  electrolytic

solution, mainly constituted by water molecules. The assembly of particles forms a set of many species,

having different mass, different constitution and different ionic states. Among the myriad of species,  we

focus  attention  to  one  particular  kind  of  particle  devised  as  an  hydrated/solvated  ion,  homogeneously

distributed  into  the  bulk  of  the  system.  To  simplify  we  call  this  singular  ion  a  Brownian  particle  which,

encapsulated by a shell of water molecules due to polar attraction, moves inside the electrolytic medium

performing  a  Brownian  motion.  This  complex  homogeneous  medium  undergoes  a  symmetry  break  at

time,  t = 0 ,  when  an  electric  potential  difference  is  setting  up  and  the  electrode  is  activated.  On  the

electrode,  there  are  many  electroactive  points  (we  call  them,  nucleus,  from  now  on)  which  are  able  to

interchange  charges  with  the  specific  ions  we  are  looking  for.  Some  of  these  points  are  automatically

activate  at  t = 0 ; others turn to be  activated during the course  of time,  depending  on  the  physical  and

chemical conditions imposed on the system.

              In  the  vicinity  of  the  electrode  our  system  is  very  complex,  clearly  out  of  equilibrium  and,

possibly,    affected  by  many  different  forces  as:  electrical,  gravitational,  buoyancy  and  generalized

thermodynamic forces. The  competition  of  these  many  effects  generates  the  overall  dynamics followed

by the ions that we describe through a schema based on the four steps listed below.

1.  The  Brownian  particle  (hydrated  ion)  migrates  inside  the  bulk  (region  I  in  Fig.  1)  describing  a  free

Brownian motion.

2.  Brownian particles, which randomly cross a hemispherical surface, defined by a radius  R , will suffer

a change in its electrochemical character, a distortion or instability of the solvatation shells. As shown

in  Figure  1  this  surface  is  named  first  reaction  hemisphere  and  the  radius  R ,  reaction  radius  (a

critical distance around a nucleus). The rate at which the reaction, that changes the electrochemical

ionic character, occurs on the first reaction hemisphere is sensitive to the chemical-physics situation

(electrical conductivity of the medium, electrostatic potential on the electrode, pH, composition, etc)

but once the process is started the radius  R  stays constant during the growth process.

3. 

Inside the first reaction hemisphere (region II in Figure 1) the ion migrates towards an electro-active

site performing a diffusive motion assisted by some kind of thermodynamic force.

7

4.  At  the  elecro-active  site,  the  ions  are  reduced  and  there,  they  stick  together.  Crossing  the  first

reaction  hemisphere  is  not  a  sufficient  condition  for  the  occurrence  of  a  reduction  and  consequent

aggregation of the reduced ion on the growing nucleus.

              Once we have defined the model, some preliminary considerations are now necessary.

(a)  It will be assumed a random distribution of nucleus on the electrode

(b)  From a theoretical point of view,  R  is introduced to mimic a cut off of some potential or generalized

thermodynamic potential. That  is,  R  is considered as  a mean distance,  from  a  nucleus,  defining  a

region where the effect of some field, acting  on the reacting species, can  no  longer be ignored.  By

assuming this parameter, it is possible to obtain an analytic expression for a non-equilibrium process,

taking  into  account  spatial  inhomogeneities.  In  this  sense  the  reaction  radius  works  like  a

mathematical  apparatus  allowing  for  analytic  solutions  for  a  complex  system.  R   is  not  a  universal

constant  and  its  magnitude  changes  according  the  physical  situation  (in  a  way  not  identified  yet)

without affecting the model.

(c)  To  solve  the  problem  in  a  realistic  way,  it  is  necessary  to  choose  a  physical  variable  to  provide

opportunity for a comparison with real situations. Given that the Brownian particles are ions, it seems

natural  to  use  the  electric  current  density  flowing  through  the  electrode,  during  the  deposition

process, as the measurable physical parameter.

(d)   Once the motion of the hydrated ions is Brownian, the analysis has to be carried out in a probabilistic

manner.  We first determine the probability to find a particle at a distance  R  from the center of the

nucleus. This information turns possible to determine the number of Brownian particles crossing the

area delimited by the radius  R  per unit of time (the flux of transformed ions). Then if we know the

probability  that  an  ion  arrives  at  a  nucleus  after  entering  region  II  as  a  transformed  ion,  we  can

determine the current through equation (1).

III – CURRENT TRANSIENT EVALUATION

             Following the schema devised in the previous section, we need the flux of probability,  j R t

, ) ,

h (

, )
of ions through the first hemispherical surface and the probability,  p r t

, that an ion, which is inside

d (

the region II, arrive at a nucleus to be reduced. The knowledge of these two factors gives us the current

density as prescribed by equation (1).

h (
j R t

, )  derivation

              As stated before, in region I the hydrated ions perform a free Brownian motion. On the surface of

the first hemisphere they undergoes a kind of reaction, changing its electrochemical character at a rate

K   that  possess  a  finite  value.  This  means  we  are  assuming  the  reaction  on  the  surface  of  the  first

hemisphere  without  a  mandatory  character,  i.e.,  there  is  a  non-null  possibility  that  Brownian  particles

crosses the first hemispherical surface without underwent a reaction.

          Because in reference 10 we have worked this part of the problem,  here we give a brief explanation

about  its  solution.  To  obtain  the  probability  densities,  p r t

( , ) ,  that  a  Brownian  particle  is  on  the  first

reaction hemisphere we use the Langevin formalism13.  By a standard procedure the associated Fokker-

Planck (FP) equation in spherical coordinate is generated, namely,

In  this  equation  D   is  the  diffusion  coefficient  of  the  Brownian  particle  and  it  is  related  to  the  second

moment  of  the  distribution  whereas,    the  probability  density  is  related  to  the  Brownian  particles

In  Eq.  (4),  c r t

( , )   is  the  ion  concentration  at  a  distance  r   from  the  nucleus  and  co   its  concentration,

under equilibrium conditions, at time  t = 0 .

             Equation (4) is solved obeying the boundary conditions:

Condition (5a) expresses the possibility that the  Brownian particles,  arriving  at  the  first  reaction

hemisphere, have a non-null probability to avoid a reaction/transformation. That is, only a fraction of the

Brownian  particles,  which  arrives  on  the  hemispherical  surface,  gets  a  transformation.  Condition  (5b)

means  the  diffusion-reaction  process  affects  the  equilibrium  distribution  of  ions  just  at  finite  distances

from the reacting surface. Far from the surface, the distribution of ions remains essentially the same as in

the  equilibrium  state.  Finally,  the  initial  condition  (5c)  states  that,  the  probability  to  find  a  Brownian

particle at any distance  r  ( r Ræ

), at  t = 0 , equals unity.

              Under these conditions,   Equation (3)  is solved  as demonstrated in  reference  10.  The  solution

              Because  we  are  working  with  a  reaction-controlled  process,  the  transport  kinetic  is  so  intense

that, every time a reduction occurs at one point, the environment is restored. However, once the reaction

rate  on  the  first  reaction  hemisphere  is  slow  and  the  number  of  particles  inside  extraordinarily  large,

when compared to the number of reduced particles during the transient regime,  we assume an almost

constant density inside this volume. Thus, notwithstanding the dynamic followed by the ions inside region

II, the reaction kinetic on the surface regulate the process and a chemical kinetic equation can be used to

describe the reduction probability. Let us consider a volume, defined by the surface, which envelops all

first reaction hemispheres generated at  t = 0 (see Fig. 4). This volume V always contains the sources of

charges which, are on the surface. Its magnitude not requires a precise definition but needs to be great

enough to contain many nuclei spaced among them, in such a way, new nuclei could be activated on the

surface during the time evolution.  We observe that, a parcel of the particles contained in this volume is

located outside the hemispheres conformed by the reaction radius (they are in region  g  showed in Fig.

4). These are the particles, which could fly inside the previously formed hemispheres or inside to the new

ones, when the reactions start to deplete its number on the surface.

To calculate  p r t

the  reduction  reaction  during  the  transient  regime.  If  there  is  N T   particles  inside  the  characteristic

required to derive Eq. (8). Actually we are calling  N B  the number of reduced particles but there is many

other kind of particles composing the electrolytic solution. Among these the  A  like particles represents

the specie that react on the electrode to produce  B  like particles. Thus, inside  V , the total number of

 such,  a  and  b  are the number of particles of type  A  and  B  per unit volume respectively.

In our model every time an  A  particle (the transformed ion) arrive at a nucleus it could react, receiving

electrons from the substrate and transmuting to a  B like particles. If we assume the active nucleus as the

source of the electrons, the catalytic reaction could be represented by,

where  n   is  the  number  of  nucleus  per  unit  volume  of  the  space  and  ze -

  the  electronic  charge

transferred  to  a  particle  A   in  order  to  form  a  B   particle.  In  fact  when  the  A   particles  react  on  the

surface to produces a  B  particle, the first is subtracted from the volume whereas the other is added to

the  substrate.  In  this  sense  there  is  a  conservation  of  the  particle  number  N T .  However,  to  fix  the

concentration  of  A   particles  on  the  surface,  we  realize  that  the  high  diffusion  rate  homogenize  the

medium in very short time intervals. When the  A  particles react its number is depleted inside one of the

many hemispherical surfaces defining region II and another particles are supposed to come in from other

regions  belonging  to  the  volume  V   (those  indicated  by  g     in  Fig.  4)  or  come  in  from  out  there.  To

maintain  constant  the  number  N T we  assume  that  incoming  particles,  which  initially  are  outside  the

volume  V ,  are  irrelevant  during  the  transient  regime.  Then,  assuming  Eq.  (11)  as  an  adequate

description to the rate of material deposits increment, regulated by the reaction rate,  k , we could write:

where  dt  means an infinitesimal time interval. Eq. (12) can be rearranged using relation (10), to

when the electrostatic potential is switched on to produces an instantaneous activation of all nucleus.  A

more general situation includes a progressive increase of the nucleus density, which, in its simplest form,

is a linear function of time,

completing the derivation.

              At  this  point  it  is  important  to  emphasize  the  difference  between  the  reaction  rates  K     and

k appearing in Eqs. (6) and (16) respectively.  If we look to Eqs. (5.a) and  (12) we see that  K  stands for

the  rate  at  which  the  solvated  ions  change  their  electrochemical  character  on  the  first  reaction

hemisphere whereas  k is the reaction rate that quantifies the velocity that those ions are reduced on the

electrode surface. They both are reaction rates but describing different reactions at different places. They

also are introduced  in a quite  different  way.  K  enters through a  boundary  condition,  (Eq.  5.a),  relating

the  probability  that  a  Brownian  particles,  coming  from  the  bulk  of  the  electrolytic  solution,  undergoes  a

conformational reaction on the first reaction hemisphere. By its turn,  k  is introduced into the description

through a chemical kinetic equation, (equation 12), to quantify the frequency at  which the electrons  are

transferred in order to reduce the ions on the second reaction hemisphere (the hemisphere of deposits).

              Another  point to clarify is about  the  way  the  nucleus  works  after  a  well-developed  deposit  has

grown up over them. In fact a nucleus is always a source of charges then,  when  a material  deposit  lay

over it, the charges need to be transferred to a point on the surface of the second reaction hemisphere.

Because  in  some  place  of  this  surface  are  located  the  ions  to  be  reduced  at  any  time.  The  charge

transfer depends of the deposit electric physical properties. If it is a metallic one, all points on its surface

are  equivalent  and,  the  charges  could  be  transferred  to  anyone  of  them  according  the  location  of  the

reacting particles at the moment the reducing reaction takes place. The point on the surface, to which the

charge  is  transferred,  defines  the  shortest  distance  between  the  surface  and  the  ion  that  react  at  that

moment. There is no distinction among a reaction on the nucleus itself or at any point on the surface of a

metallic  deposit,  because  the  time  spent  to  transfer  the  charges  from  the  nucleus  to  these  points  is

sketch  of  some  deposits  in  an  electrochemical  cell.  It  is  realized  that  only  one  electroactive  point  per

nucleus  exist  on  the  corresponding  surface  during  every  reaction.  The  points  marked  “S”  in  Fig  (4)

represents the locus where a reduction is taking place at a given instant of time.

IV – RESULTS

Following  the  common  usage  the  comparison  between  the  theoretical  results  and  the

experimental data are performed through the double normalized current transients. As pointed out at the

introduction  this  procedure  gives  rise  to  misunderstanding  but  we  postpone  this  discussion  to  a  forth-

coming article. Then the current is normalized by its maximum value, 

(
tI

max )

=

I

 whereas the time is

normalized by  max

t

following an examination of the experimental data or through a plausible argumentation. To trace curves

(a), (b) and (c) in Fig. 5, we fix the value of the diffusion coefficient adopting a magnitude currently found

into the literature14,15. The same is true for  no , whose value is in agreement with the number of nuclei per

unit  area  currently  assigned  to  silicon  electrodes16,17.    R   is  a  new  parameter  whose  magnitude  and

meaning is not clear still now, as discussed in references [1] and [2], so   its value is taken in an arbitrary

way.  Interfacial  controlled  process  requires  a  reaction  kinetic  slower  than  the  diffusion  kinetic,  so,  the

magnitude of  K  and   k  are constrained by the magnitude of the diffusion constant. Then, fixed  R  and

D ,  we  examine  the  ratio 

  to  define  K .    This  ratio  compares  the  frequency  of  the  reactive

K
DR

2p

process  and  a  frequency  connected  to  diffusion  (mass  transport).  As  a  criterion  we  forbid  this  ratio  to

assume values much higher than one. Although the dominance of interfacial control over diffusion control

results from the combined effect of   Kand  k , when: 

1

, the process is reaction-controlled (see

K
DR

p

2

curve  (a)  in  Fig.  5).  When  this  ratio  is  grater  than  one  (like  in  curves  (b)  and  (c)  of  Fig.  5),  there  is  a

tendency of the curves to get closer the SH results. That  is a clear indication of and increase in diffusion

contribution    to  defines  the  overall  process.  k   and  a

  are  selected  in  orders  that  both  factors  be

comparable  in  magnitude.  This  choice  gives  to  instantaneous  and  progressive  activation  equal

importance to define the argument of the exponential function in Eq. (16). The parameter,  a

is set free

for  adjustment  with  experimental  data  but,  the  reactions  rate  K   and  k   have  values  (see  Table  I)

compatible with those found in  chemical undergraduate textbooks18,19.  It is important to note that, rather

than a good fit, we search for a behavior (on the current curves) which turns evident the existence of a

mixture  of 

instantaneous  ( no

„ 0 )  and  progressive  ( a

„ 0 )  nucleation 

in  reaction-controlled

depositions.

In  Fig.  5  we  show  three  curves  obtained  from  Eq.  (18).  They  are  plotted  together  with  three

experimental curves (symbols) and the two limit curves given by the SH model.  The situation is the same

as that considered in reference [10] and depicted at Fig. 3, however there is a basic difference; now  we

are  using  expression  (16)  to  represent  the  reactions  on  the  surface  whereas  in  reference  [10],  and  in

Fig.3,  we used the Eq. (2) in its place. A  consequence of this change is observed when analyzing the

current  density  slopes  between 

= 0   and   

= 1.  The  curves  are  now  (in  Fig.  5)  in  good

t
t max

t
t max

agreement  with    the  experimental  data  and,  are  located  between  the  SH  theoretical  predictions. When

a = 0  (Fig. 3) there is a feeble adjustment of the theoretical curves with the experimental ones, at times

t

t max

,  whereas  in  Fig.  5    (when  a

„ 0   and  no

„ 0 )  we  see  a  good  adjustment  to  all  t .    We  also

observe  that  the  SH  curves  are  not  adequate  to  describe  the  current  transients  in  this  case,  a  rather

foreseen result, given that  SH model is developed for a diffusion controlled process.

Æ
£
16

 We  rationalize  that,  reaction-control  depositions  requires  a  more  subtle  characterization  in  regard  to

reaction mechanism. The reactions are so slow, compared to mass transport, that a minimal variation in

the chemical kinetic implies considerable  changes on the current transients. In effect the solution of the

kinetic  equation  (Eq.  (12))  is  very  sensitive  to  the  form  of  the  nuclei  activation.  According

physical/chemical conditions both regimes, instantaneous and progressive, turns to be equally important.

On the other hand, when mass transport regulates the dynamic, the chemical interfacial relation is not so

relevant.  Then  the  nuclei  activation  mechanism  assumes  a  minor  importance  and  the  nucleation  is

adequately described as  instantaneous or progressive according the  dominance of  n ko

 or 

k on the

a

2

exponential argument of Eq. (16).

              Finally it is important to remark that Eq. (16) resembles a generalized Avrami’ factor12,20 where a

linear term and a quadratic term in  t  are mixed together  into the  exponential argument . It is just  this

association  that  allows  for  a  suitable  fit  between  theoretical  and  experimental  results  in  the  range

1

  (see  Fig.  5).    For 

1  the  current  transient  behavior  is  strongly  affected  by  the

0

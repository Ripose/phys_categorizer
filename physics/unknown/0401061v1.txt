Abstract. Semi-empirical procedure of obtaining the boundary conditions for strong evaporation of a polyatomic gas is
proposed. The procedure is based on specifying the dependencies of specific momentum and enthalpy of the flow from
the gas flow rate. The latter are derived from the analysis of the available data concerning the evaporation of polyatomic
and  monatomic  gases  [1,2].  The  procedure  predicts  the  exactly  sonic  terminal  velocity  of  the  flow  and  leads  to  some
corrections of boundary conditions [1] in transonic region. Thus, for j=2 and sonic flow the corrected values of pressure,
temperature and fraction of back-scattered molecules are about 1.007, 0.97 and 0.92 of those reported in Ref. 1.

INTRODUCTION

The  problem  of  polyatomic  gas  evaporation  attracts  much  less  attention  in  comparison  with  the  case  of
monatomic  gas.  This  circumstance  seemed  to  be  caused  by  more  complex  character  of  the  flow  of  evaporated
molecules with internal degrees of freedom.

For  some  problems  of  hydrodynamics  and  thermophysics,  which  are  connected  with  evaporation  of  molecular
vapour from solid or liquid state into flooded space, it is necessary to know the relation between the parameters on
the evaporated surface and that on the external boundary of the Knudsen layer  without detailed information about
the structure of the layer. A good approach for these boundary conditions is proposed in Ref. 1, where the problem is
treated  based  on  the  model  representation  of  the  distribution  function.  The  analysis  of  these  conditions  shows,
however,  that  they  are  not  completely  adequate  for  transonic  terminal  velocities  –  the  maximum  value  of  the  gas
flow rate g is predicted at the Mach numbers less than unity.

To correct the boundary conditions of Ref. 1 for transonic region of terminal velocities a simple semi-empirical
procedure is proposed. The procedure is based on the dependencies of specific momentum i and enthalpy h of the
flow from  the  gas  flow rate g. The analysis of the data of  Ref. 1 reveals that  for any values  of  g  the  variable  i  is
highly conservative to the number of internal degrees of freedom j and is practically the same as in available solution
of  the  Boltzmann  equation  for  monatomic  gas  evaporation  [2].  This  circumstance  allows  one  to  suppose  that  the
remaining  variable  h  may  be  obtained  by  proper  estimation  of  contribution  of  internal  degrees  of  freedom  and
adding it to corresponding value for monatomic gas. The procedure predicts the exactly sonic terminal velocity of
the flow and leads to some corrections of boundary conditions [1] in transonic region.

PROCEDURE AND RESULTS

It  is  well  known  that  for  the  problem  of  gas  evaporation  from  the  plane  surface  only  one  parameter  may  be
specified at infinity. Among these parameters may be pressure p, temperature T, density ρ, velocity u, or some their
combination like Mach number M, gas flow rate g, etc. The two other parameters, which are needed to define the
parameters of the gas flow, are to be found as a result of the solution of Boltzmann equation for considered problem.
For each of the parameters specified at infinity the steady solution exists in definite region of its variation.

The  problem  of  obtaining  the  boundary  conditions  is  equivalent,  therefore,  to  the  problem  of  finding  the

dependencies  i(g, j) and h(g, j), which are bound to the parameters of the gas flow by the relations:

u + T / u = i (g, j)                                                                                  (1)

                                                             (5+j) T / 2 + u2 / 2 = h (g, j).                                                                      (2)

The  variables  u  and  T  in  (1),  (2)  are  in  dimension  form  in  the  system  of  units  where  the  pressure  ps  and
temperature  Ts  on  the  evaporated  surface,  as  well  as  the  gas  constant  R  are  equal  to  unity.  The  variable  g  is
normalized by the value (2 π)  -1/2, representing the maximum mass flux from the evaporated surface without back-
scattered molecules.

FIGURE 1.  The dependencies of i (g, j) for g = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 (a) and Tr (g) for j = 2 (b).

Fig. 1a represents the dependencies of i (g, j) for three values of g (0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and  0 ≤ j ≤ 4, predicted by
the model, proposed in Ref. 1 (solid lines). The results of the solution of the Boltzmann equation for monatomic gas
evaporation (j=0) [2] are also shown for comparison (solid circles). These data reveal high conservativity of specific
momentum to the number of internal degrees of freedom. This circumstance is not evident a priori and  allows one
to  suppose  that  the  remaining  variable  h  may  be  obtained  by  proper  estimation  of  the  contribution  of    internal
degrees of freedom Tr and adding it to corresponding value for monatomic gas:

                                                               h (g, j) = h (g, 0) + j Tr / 2.                                                                       (3)

Fig. 1b represents the dependence of Tr (g) for j = 2  derived from the data of Ref. 1 for j = 0 and j = 2 using the
relation (3) (dashed line). As can be seen from this data for the range g ≤ 0.4 the linear dependence Tr (g) (solid line)
takes place

                                                                     Tr = 1 + α (j) g.                                                                                   (4)

Similar dependencies of Tr (g) are observed for other values of j. The values of α (j) obtained by the least squares
method for the range g ≤0.4 and j = 2, 3 and 4 were found to be equal to 0.02122, 0.01827 and 0.01603, respectively.
Assuming, that a sharp increase of Tr (g) at large g (see Fig. 1b) is caused by approximate nature of the model [1]
with prescribed form of distribution function, in the proposed procedure the relation (4) is spread on the whole range
of g.

The proposed procedure consists, therefore, of combining the results of Refs. 1, 2 in the following manner. From
the results of Ref. 1 the variables α (j) are derived, that allows one to define h (g, j) through h (g, 0) (see Eq. 3). The
dependencies of  h (g, 0) and i (g, 0) = i (g , j) are derived from the results of  Ref. 2,  which  are  tabulated,  that  is
convenient for such purpose. After that the relations (1), (2) may be resolved relatively u (g) and T (g) that allows
one to determine all other parameters of the flow (p, ρ, M, etc.). The procedure predicts the exactly sonic terminal
velocity of the flow and leads to some corrections of boundary conditions [1] in the transonic region.

Fig.  2  represents  the  dependencies  of  g  (M)  (Fig.  2a)  and  T  (M)  (Fig.  2b)  for j  =  0,  2  and  3  predicted  by  the
model of Ref. 1 (dashed lines) together with the present results for j = 2 and 3 (solid lines). The dependencies of Ref.
2 for monatomic gas (j = 0) are also shown for comparison (solid lines).

FIGURE 2.  The dependencies of g (M) (a) and T (M) (b) for j = 0, 2 and 3.

As can be seen from the data for g (M) the proposed correction removes unphysical maximum of g at M < 1. The
modified  curves  g  (M)  for  j  =  2  and  3  are  higher  than  those  from  Ref.  1  for  M  ≥  0.6.  These  differences  are
qualitatively the same as the difference between the solid and dashed curves for monatomic gas.

Similar situation takes place for the dependencies T (M) (see Fig. 2b). The corrected values of T are lower than

those from Ref. 1 for M ≥ 0.6.

Table  1  contains  some  of  the  obtained  results  for  p,  T  and  the  fraction  of  back-scattered  molecules  β  (in  our

notations β = 1 – g) for sonic flow (M = 1) and  j = 1 ÷ 4 in comparison with the corresponding data from Ref. 1.

As can be seen from these data  for j=2 the corrected values of pressure, temperature and the  fraction of  back-

scattered molecules are about 1.007, 0.97 and 0.92, respectively, of those reported in Ref. 1.

The boundary conditions for evaporation of polyatomic gas, proposed in Ref. 1 are good enough for wide range
of  terminal  Mach  number  except  the  transonic  region  of  velocities,  where  some  corrections  are  needed.  Such
corrections are provided by the proposed procedure. The correction leads to lower values of temperature and fraction
of back-scattered molecules, but practically to the same values of pressure. Additional investigations are needed to
check the obtained results.

Abstract

In the NLC (Next Linear Collider) small misalignments
in  each  of  the  individual  accelerator  structures  (or  the
accelerator cells) will give rise to wakefields which  kick
the  beam  from  its  electrical  axis.    This  wakefield  can
resonantly drive the beam into a BBU (Beam Break Up)
instability or at the very least it will dilute the emittance
of  the  beam.  A  Gaussian  detuned  structure  has  been
designed  and  tested  [1]  at  SLAC  and  in  this  paper  we
explore  new  distributions  with  possibly  better  damping
properties.

which  does  not  continue  to  fall  rapidly  because  in
sampling the Gaussian (with a finite number of cells and a
specified  frequency  bandwidth)  one  is  forced  to  truncate
the function and the resulting wakefield is the convolution
of  a  Gaussian  function  and  a  sinc  function:  sinc(f)  =
sin(p f)/(p f).   In this case, the spacing of the minima is not
uniform and thus a uniformly spaced multi-bunch train is

idealised distributions

In  order  to  reduce  the  large  ripple  we  have  considered
various distributions to replace the Gaussian prescription.
In  this  paper  we  will  concentrate  on  a  number  of
convolutions  of  the  top  hat  function. 
  A  top  hat
distribution has a sinc function as its Fourier tranform and
this falls of as 1/s.  Each additional convolution leads to a
1/sk  fall-off  in  the  wakefield.    Here,  we  consider  k=2  (a
triangular  distribution,  g2)  and  k=3  (the  convolution  of  a
triangular function with a top hat function, g3) and k=4 the
self-convolution  of  the  triangular  function  and  these  are
shown in Fig 1.  The Fourier transform of the k=4 case is
given  by  sinc4  function  and  this  is  compared  with  the
truncated  Gaussian  in  Fig  2.  together  with  the  k=2  and
k=3  cases.      The  function  described  by  the  k=4  case  is
identically zero at frequency units  – 2 and thus enforced
truncation  is  not  necessary.      The  peak  values  in  the
ripples  of  the  wakefield  of  the  truncated  Gaussian  lie
below the sinc2 but not below the sinc4 function.   For this
reason we choose a g4 (sinc4 in wake space) design for a
new  RDDS  based  upon  a  mapping  function  [3]  re-
parameterisation of RDDS1.

2. WAKE ENVELOPE FUNCTION FOR A

SINC4 DISTRIBUTION

We  compute  the  wake  envelope  function  using  the
spectral function method [4] and this method has  proven
quite  accurate  in  predicting  the  wakefield  of  a  realistic
structure [1].   The spectral function for sinc4 is shown in
fig. 3.  and the main difference from the spectral function
of  RDDS1 (fig 7)  lies in the upper frequency end of the
distribution.    In  the  case  of  RDDS1  the  kick  factors
increase almost  linearly  with  synchronous  frequency  and
towards  the  end  of  the  high  frequency  end  of  the  first
dipole band [2] the mode density (dn/df) has to increase in
order that Kdn/df be a symmetric function that falls with a

Gaussian  profile.    However,  as  dn/df  increases  then,  of
course, the modal separation  (approximately 50 MHz or
more  compared  to  7MHz  in  the  center  of  the  band)
increases  and  hence  the  modes  are  not  particularly  well
damped  by  the  manifold  in  the  high  frequency  region.
However, the sinc4 possesses the useful property that the
modes  are  much  more  well  damped  in  this  region  (15.8
GHz and beyond) and this we attribute to the modes being
more closely spaced in frequency.
   The wakefield corresponding to the spectral function of
Fig 3, is shown in Fig 4 and the main improvement over
the wakefield of our present structure, RDDS1 (shown in
Fig. 7) lies in the region 0 to 10 m in which the wakefield
is improved by a factor of approximately 2 or more.   Also

long range wakes.  However approximately 6 % emittance
growth  occurs  for  RDDS1.    The  phase  space,  shown  in
Fig 10, indicates that for the sinc4 distribution the particles
are  well  contained  but  for  RDDS1  the  bunch  train  is
starting  to  break  up.      Nonetheless,  emittance  growth  is
unlikely to be a  problem  for  RDDS1  because:  firstly  the
the systematic shift is  unlikely  to  be  so  large  (-0.48%  in
the  bunch  spacing  corresponds  to  a  shift  in  the  dipole
mode frequency of 72 MHz) and secondly, the shift is not
expected  to  be  identical  from  structure-to-structure  and
this  has  been  shown  [6]  to  significantly  reduce  any
emittance growth.

4. CONCLUSIONS

A  sinc4  distribution  for  the  uncoupled  leads  to  improved
damping of the transverse wakefield.  The mean value of
Ss   is  approximately  2  times  smaller  than  that  of  our
present  structure,  RDDS1  and,  we  have  found  that  no
significant emittance growth occurs over a  broad range of
systematic  shifts  in  the  synchronous  frequencies  of  the
cells.  However, additional optimisation of the frequency
distribution  and  in  the  coupling  of  the  wakefield  to  the
manifold,  should  lead  to  even  better  damping  of  the
wakefield.    In  the  near  future,  we  plan  to  embark  on  a
program of iterative optimisation of the wakefield.

The  sum  wakefield  is  useful  in  that  it  provides  an
indicator as to whether or not BBU (Beam Break Up) will

provides  a  convenient  means  of  shifting  all  the  cell
frequencies  by  a  fixed  amount  and  it  corresponds  to  a
systematic error in the synchronous frequencies [*Ref*].
    From  previous  simulations,  peaks  in  the  standard
deviation of the sum wakefield close to unity have proved
to  be  a  symptom  of  BBU.    However,  BBU  is  indeed  a
complex  phenomena  and,  in  order  to  be  sure  that  BBU
will actually take place many particle tracking simulations

next section the results on particle tracking simulations at
peak values in Ss

 are presented.

monitored.    Additional  details  regarding  the  simulation
parameters are given in [6]. At the nominal bunch spacing
(84  cm)  Ss   is  approximately  0.15  V/pC/mm/m  and  0.3
V/pC/mm/m  for  the  new  distribution  and  for  RDDS1,

1. Abstract 

The project DELSY is being under development at JINR, Dubna, Russia. This synchrotron 
radiation source [1-3] is dedicated to the investigation on condensed matter physics, atomic physics, 
biology, medicine, chemistry, micromechanics, lithography and others. The storage ring DELSY is 
an  electron  storage  ring  with  the  beam  energy  1.2  GeV  and  4  straight  sections  to  accommodate 
accelerator  equipment  and  insertion  devices.  One  of  the  straight  sections  is  intended  for  a  10  T 
superconducting  wiggler  (wavelength  shifter)  and  one  for  the  undulator  with  150  periods  and  a 
magnetic field of 0.75 T. The wiggler will influence many aspects of beam dynamics: linear motion, 
dynamic  aperture,  emittance,  damping  times  etc.  The  problem  is  rather  serious  for  the  DELSY 
machine  because  the  energy  of  the  electron  beam  is  small  while  the  wiggler's  magnetic  field  is 
strong. 

In this paper  we consider two models of the wiggler's magnetic field with and without the 
focusing caused by the sextupolar field of the wiggler as we need to develop the requirements to the 
wiggler design. We study the influence of the 10 T wiggler on the beam dynamics in the DELSY 
storage  ring  and  propose  a  possible  scheme  to  cure  it  [2-4].  The  combined  work  of  the  insertion 
devices is presented too. 

2. Wiggler model 

Since  the  magnetic  field  of  the  wiggler  has  variation  in  both  transverse  and  longitudinal 
direction,  it  is  not  easy  to  represent  it  by  a  step-wise  function  as  is  usually  done  with  dipole  and 
quadrupole magnets in a hard edge approximation approach.  Basically, investigation of the charged 
particle  motion  in  the  wiggler  field  is  performed  by  special  tracking  routines  which  use  some  of 
canonical integration techniques. We shall elaborate a simple but still realistic wiggler model to use 
it in a typical accelerator simulation codes. 

For  this  purpose  we  use  the  magnetic  measurement  data  of  the  10  T  wiggler  that  was 
produced  by  BINP  for  the  Spring-8  synchrotron  light  source  [5].  The  result  of  the  step-by-step 
mapping  of  the  wiggler's  magnetic  field  is  fitted  by  the  spline  approximation.  For  this 
approximation, the on-axis field expansion coefficients, the trajectory and the angle deviation were 
found numerically (Fig.1, 2).

Knowing the beam orbit we need to write down equations of particle motion in the vicinity 
of  the  orbit  in  the  curvilinear  coordinate  system  that  relates  to  this  orbit.  The  magnetic  field

Fig.4. Transverse sextupole component b as a function of the longitudinal coordinate 

 
The  field  expansion  (1)  is  rather  complex  to  be  used  in  typical  accelerator  codes  and  we 
have  to  study  each  term  in  the  above  expressions  separately  to  simplify  the  wiggler  field 
representation.  During  this  analysis  we  shall  take  into  consideration  the  fact  that  the  betatron 
functions  are  practically  constant  along  the  wiggler  length.  This  fact  allows  us  to  use  averaged 
values  instead  of  actual  longitudinal  distributions.  The  wiggler  field  is symmetric  in  three  planes, 
therefore  only  odd-order  field  components  exist  in  the  horizontal  direction  in  medial  plane.  Even 
components of the magnetic field may appear in the case of orbit distortion inside the wiggler and 
can be calculated by transforming the coordinate system. For the wiggler of Spring-8 the dipole and 
sextupole components  have  been measured. On the basis of these data the quadrupole component 
was  calculated.  To  calculate  the  octupole  component,  the  next  odd-order  field  component  is 
required, but the decapole component has not been measured. Actually, the main acting nonlinearity 
is sextupole. For this reason we use model the field expansion (1) up to the sextupole order for the 
wiggler's magnetic field. 

 

2.1. Linear model of the wiggler field 

The  simplest  way  to  construct  the  model  is  to  make  it  from  the  set  of  hard-edge  magnets 
with  the  field  integrals  equal  to  the  measured  ones.  But  this  model  has  strong  drawback:  the 
focusing  properties  of  the  wiggler  (which  appear  due  to  presence  of  the  nonlinear  magnetic  field 
and big orbit offset and angle in wiggler) will not be taken into account.  

The dipole field at the wiggler orbit is described by the expansion coefficients Bz00 in (1):

The  first  term  in  (2)  corresponds  to  the  on-axis  dipole  field  and  the  second  one  describes  the 
sextupole contribution, which is rather small in comparison with the pure dipole field. The central 
region  field  integral  evaluated  numerically  from  the  measurement  for  the  region  (-119,  119)  mm 
(Fig.3) is equal to

, where kx, kz are the coefficients of the horizontal and vertical focusing, it is clear 

that  the  negative  portion  of  the  kx  compensates  the  positive  one,  so  the  resulting  value  for  the 
horizontal plane should be small in comparison with the vertical focusing. This represents the well-
known fact: if there is no horizontal variation of the wiggler's magnetic field (sextupole component 
is equal to zero), the wiggler focuses the beam only in the vertical plane, while horizontal focusing 
is exactly zero. 

Now,  when  we  have  prepared  field  and  focusing  integrals  from  the  results  of  magnetic 
measurements, we can start the construction of the linear model of the wiggler magnetic field. It is 
evident  that  more  serious  attention  should  be  paid  to  the  central  pole  with  meeting  the  following 
requirements: 
1)  conservation of the pole bending angle αw (4) 

2)  conservation of the integral horizontal focusing

where  D  is  the  dispersion  function  and  n  is  the  gradient  field  index.  The  central  pole  of  the 
wiggler  has  side  regions  where  the  dipole  field  is  combined  with  the  gradient  field  (edge 
focusing). These regions correspond to the second term in (7) and can influence on the damping 
partition numbers, energy spread, horizontal emittance, etc. 

We  describe  the  central  pole  of  the  wiggler  by  a  set  of  3  sector  dipoles  as  is  shown 
schematically  in  Fig.6.  BM1  corresponds  to  the  central  region  of  the  pole  field  and  focuses  the 
beam only due to ρ-2 but has no vertical focusing. Two dipoles BM2 correspond to the side region 
of the wiggler pole with both the dipole and the gradient field to represent (7) properly.  Addition of 
the  side  dipoles  in  the  model  improves  precision  of  the  second  and  third  synchrotron  radiation 
integrals I2 and I3 as well.

Here L, ρ and k are the length, bending radius and vertical and horizontal focusing strength of the 
relevant  dipole  magnet.  To  solve  these  equations  we  fix  the  following  parameters:  L1=0.06  m 
(compromise  between  the  length  of  the  vertical  and  horizontal  focusing  distribution  in  the  actual 
wiggler  field),  ρ1=ρw=0.4  m  at  1.2  GeV.  With  this  choice  solution  of  (8)  yields  the  following 
parameters of the model for the central pole of the wiggler: 
BM1: L1=0.06 m, ρ1=0.4 m, kz1=0 m-2, 
BM2: L2=0.0406 m, ρ2=0.45 m, kz2=9.551 m-2. 

The requirements to the side poles are weaker in comparison with those to the central one, 
so we can write them in the same way but with a single dipole magnet. We set the distance between 
central and side poles 0.049 m and the efficient length of the side pole Ls=0.35 m (Fig.3). From the 
side pole bending angle αws=αw/2 we can calculate the bending radius: ρs=2.118 m. The side pole 
focusing occurs in a usual way as for any rectangular magnet, because the sextupole component on 
the beam orbit is small for the side pole (Fig.4). In our case the focusing strength of the side pole is

2.2. Nonlinear wiggler fields 

According to (1) the wiggler produces sextupole-like and octupole-like non-linear magnetic 
fields. The sextupole-like non-linearity is given in (1) by three coefficients Bz20, Bz02, Bx11, but the 
analysis  shows  that  only  the  actual  sextupole  b(s)  should  be  taken  into  account.  The  edge  field 
contribution  a ′′  is large (Fig.7) but its integral is exactly equal to zero. This well-known fact can be 
shown with explicit calculation of the integral:

Other  terms  in  Bz20,  Bz02  and  Bx11  depend  on  ξ0
model we can use only the actual sextupole distribution b(s) that is plotted in Fig.4. According to 
this  plot  we  propose  to  represent  the  wiggler  sextupoles  as  a  set  of  two  nonlinear  kicks  with  the

A  layout  with  four  straight  sections  was  chosen  for  the  DELSY  storage  ring.  The 
periodicity  of  the  ring  is  2.  Every  quadrant  consists  of  the  MBA  structure:  two  halves  of  straight 
sections and two periodic cells. The periodic cell consists of two dipoles and three quadrupoles. The 
matching cell contains two dipoles and provides zero dispersion in the straight section. A doublet 
adjusts  the  particular  values  of  the  beta  functions  in  the  straight  sections.  The  basic  machine 
parameters are given in Table 2.

The beta functions in a very strong wiggler must be small enough to avoid an increase in 
the emittance and to minimise the optics distortions with the wiggler on. In our case βx=1.05 m and 
βy=2.80  m.  The  vertical  beta function in the centre  of  the undulator must  be  small to  provide the 
tolerable lifetime limited by the residual gas scattering. It was taken to be βx=14.55 m and βy=0.98 
m  (Fig.9).  In  another  “undulator”  quadrant  the  injection  septum  is  placed.  Two  injection  kickers 
separated in 9π betatron phase advance are located in the “wiggler” quadrants.

The injection energy for DELSY is 0.8 GeV, while operation is at 1.2 GeV. This imposes 
strong  constraints  on  the  dynamic  aperture  of  DELSY.  The  solution  with  two  sextupole  families 
that fits requirements was found. First, phase advances of the periodic cell were chosen to provide a 
small  emittance  with  tolerable  natural  chromaticities.  Then  the  positions  of  the  sextupoles  in  the 
matching cells were adjusted. Since the wiggler insertion breaks the ring symmetry from 2 to 1 and 
the number of resonances in the vicinity of the working point increases drastically, non-linear beam 
dynamics and dynamic aperture shrinking may arise to become a serious problem. Hence, usual fast 
determination  of  the  dynamic  aperture  border  now  seems  not  enough.  To  save  computing  time, 
most  codes  define  the  dynamic  aperture  "from  outside",  when  a  particle  starts  from  the  surely 
unstable  region  and  then  step-by-step  counts  down  the  initial  motion  amplitude  until  the  stable 
region  is  found.  An  evident  drawback  of  this  method  is  that  if  the  particle  runs  across  the  stable 
island of a high-order resonance, the wrong dynamic aperture will be found. To avoid this mistake 
we additionally apply a different technique of a surviving plot "from inside". The particle scans the 
amplitude  space  starting  from  the  coordinate  origin  and  the  number  of  survived  revolutions  is 
plotted as a function of the initial amplitudes (Ax, Az). In our case the maximum number of turns is 
1000. This algorithm is rather time-consuming but yields more reliable and detailed information. 

The  on-energy  dynamic  aperture  of  the  machine  caused  by  the chromatic sextupoles (the 
wiggler  is  switched  off)  is  shown  in  Fig.10.  The  dynamic  aperture  is plotted for  the  initial lattice 
azimuth  with  the  natural chromaticity corrected  to  0 in  both  planes.  Calculations were made with 
the OPA computer code [6].

3.2. The influence of the 10 T wiggler on the linear optics and dynamic aperture 

Inserting  the  10  T  wiggler  in  the  way  described  in  the  previous  section  produces  an 
unstable  lattice,  so  the  ring  cannot  operate  without  compensation  for  the  wiggler  influence.  The 
following procedure was used to minimise great distortion of the linear optics. First, the strengths of 
two quadrupoles in the doublet matching the wiggler section were modified to maintain constraints 
(αx=αy=0) with the wiggler on and off. This prevents the beating of the beta functions everywhere 

 

11

outside the wiggler section. After this the machine tunes are changed significantly. To bring them 
back  and  to  maintain  the  required  beta  functions  in  the  straight  sections,  a  global  matching 
procedure involving all quadrupole families were used. This procedure was made for two models of 
the wiggler's magnetic field: for the model without focusing coming from the sextupolar field of the 
wiggler in the side magnet of the central pole and for the model with them (see Table 1), as we have 
to define the requirements to the wiggler. 

For  the  first  model  the  deviation  of  the  beta  functions  is  less  than  7%  (Fig.11),  the 
emittance increased by a factor of 1.9  and  the natural  energy spread increased  by  a factor of 1.72 
(Table 3).

In spite of the increased number of high-order resonances near the stable motion boundary, 

the dynamic aperture still seems sufficient for the reliable machine operation (Fig.12).

For  the  second  model  the  correction  of  the  wiggler  influence  on  the  linear  optics  is  more 
difficult:  the  gradients  of  the quadrupoles  are bigger that  in  the previous  model,  additional power 
supply is needed for the quadrupoles placed in the matching cell near the wiggler. The maximum of 
the  horizontal  beta  function  increases  to  78  m  (Fig.13),  the  emittance  increases  to  39  nm, 
chromaticity is bigger than in the previous model too and equals -28.22/-12.93.

For the second model of the wiggler's magnetic field the shrinking of the dynamic aperture 

for the regime with the wiggler on is more essential (Fig.14).

model of the wiggler's magnetic field 

 
The  main  conclusion  is  that  the  wiggler  has  to  be  manufactured  in  the  way  to  reduce  the 
focusing  coming  from  the  sextupolar  field.  One  of  the  ways  to  do  this  is  as  follows:  the  beam  is 
declined by a pair of dipole correctors (upstream and downstream the wiggler) so as to keep always 
the  radiation  source  point  in  the  middle  of  the  central  pole  with  zero  displacement.  In  this  case 
particles travel in the high-field region near the wiggler axis and we can expect that the influence of 
transverse nonlinearity will be significantly reduced. The other advantage is the fixed geometry of 
the synchrotron radiation light for different field levels. 

3.3. The influence of the undulator on the linear optics and dynamic aperture 

Within the computer code OPA we can describe the undulator as an individual element. The 
effect of the undulator (0.75 T, 150 periods of 1.5 cm) on the machine optics is much smaller than 
the  effect  of  the  wiggler  (Table  4).  The  deviation  of  the  beta  functions  for  the  machine  with  the 
undulator on is less than 1 % (Fig.15), the emittance increases to 11.8 nm.

3.4. The influence of the both insertion devices on the DELSY beam dynamics 

We  calculated  the  regime  with  both  insertion  devices  on  only  for  the  first  model  of  the 
wiggler's magnetic field. The basic parameters of this regime are presented in Table 5. Due to the 
additional  quantum  excitation  the  horizontal  emittance  has  grown  up  by  a  factor  of  1.78  in 
comparison  with  the  initial  regime  without  the  insertion  devices.  This  reduces  the  light  source 
brightness and increased vertical betatron function (Fig.16).

The dynamic aperture is plotted in Fig.17. The analysis shows that the dynamic aperture is 

reduced mainly due to the breaking of the ring symmetry.

4. Conclusions 

The  magnetic  field  model  is  elaborated  for  the  10  T  wiggler.  The  result  of  the  wiggler 
influence on the DELSY beam dynamics is valid only for the wiggler model described above. This 
model,  based  on  magnetic  field  expansion  around  central  orbit  in  the  wiggler,  represent  its  main 
properties including focusing. The following conclusions can be drawn from the present study: 

1)  the 10 T wiggler significantly influences the storage ring dynamics; 
2)  this influence can be recovered by applying local and global linear optics correction; 
3)  when the linear lattice is cured well, the reduction of dynamic aperture with the wiggler 

4)  the  emittance  increases  by  a  factor  of  1.78  for  the  regime  when  both  insertion  devices 

5)  the  main  requirement  for  the  wiggler  design  is  to  decrease  focusing  coming  from  the 

and undulator on is not big; 

are switched on; 

sextupolar field of the wiggler.

ABSTRACT 
 
Langmuir  probe  techniques  have  been  used  to  study  time  and  spatially  resolved  electron 
densities  and  electron  temperatures  in  pulse-modulated  hydrogen  discharges  in  two  different 
planar  microwave  reactors  (fmicrowave=  2.45  GHz,  tpulse=  1  ms).  The  reactors  are  (i)  a  standing-
wave  radiative  slotted  waveguide  reactor  and  (ii)  a  modified  travelling-wave  radiative  slotted 
waveguide  reactor,  which  generate  relatively  large  plasmas  over  areas  from  about  350 cm2  to 
500 cm2. The plasma properties of these reactor types are of particular interest as they have been 
used  for  basic  research  and  for  plasma  processing,  e.g.  for  surface  treatment  and  layer 
deposition. In the present study the pressures and microwave powers in the reactors were varied 
between 33 and 55 Pa and 600 and 3600 W, respectively. In regions with high electromagnetic 
fields  shielded  Langmuir  probes  were  used  to  avoid  disturbances  of  the  probe  characteristic. 
Close  to  the  microwave  windows  of  the  reactors  both  the  electron  density  and  the  electron 
temperature  showed  strong  inhomogeneities.  In  the  standing-wave  reactor  the  inhomogeneity 
was  found  to  be  spatially  modulated  by  the  position  of  the  slots.  The  maximum  value  of  the 
electron temperature was about 10 eV and the electron density varied between 0.2 and 14×1011 
cm-3. The steady state electron temperature in a discharge pulse was reached within a few tens of 
microseconds  whereas  the  electron  density  needed  some  hundreds  of  microseconds  to  reach  a 
steady state. Depending on the reactor the electron density reached a maximum between 80 and 
200 (cid:181)s after the beginning of the pulse.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 

Non-equilibrium  plasmas  are  used  in  a  variety  of  applications,  e.g.  for  thin  film 
deposition,  semiconductor  processing,  surface  activation  and  cleaning.  These  plasmas  are  of 
growing  interest  not  only  in  the  field  of  plasma  processing,  because  of  their  favourable 
properties, but also in basic research. Discharges excited by microwaves are characterized by an 
efficient  power  coupling  without  the  use  of  electrodes.  This  design  leads  to  advantages,  in 
particular  when  high  purity  discharges  are  needed.  Typical  for  microwave  plasmas  containing 
molecular gases such as  hydrogen, is a relatively  high degree of dissociation which  in turn can 
lead to high chemical reactivity.  

In  the  last  decade  several  different  approaches  have  been  made  to  create  microwave 
plasmas over extended volumes needed for plasma processing. In the low pressure range (0.1-1 
Pa) magnetic confinement has lead to highly ionised plasmas in relatively large volumes with or 
without electron cyclotron resonance heating [1-3]. At higher pressures (10-100 Pa) the decrease 
of the mean free path length of the electrons causes an inhomogeneous density of the plasma for 
large volumes or surfaces [4]. One general approach to overcome the problem of inhomogeneity 
consists  of  one  or  two  waveguides  combined  with  slots  or  antennas  in  such  a  way  that  the 
electromagnetic  field  coupled  into  the  reactor  volume  is  consistently  homogenous  at  a  certain 
distance  from the waveguide. Such  large  sized reactors have  been constructed  in  circular [8-9] 
and planar geometry [2, 5-9].  

Over the last few years planar microwave plasma reactors have been used extensively in 
a  continuous  mode  for  plasma  chemical  applications  [5],  for  example,  in  diamond  deposition, 
surface  corrosion  protection  by  deposition  of  organosilicon  compounds,  surface  cleaning,  and 
plasma induced surface modification [6,10-12]. The analysis of excitation processes such as the 
determination  of  the  gas  temperature  and  of  the  degree  of  dissociation  in  plasmas  containing 
molecular feed gases, e.g. hydrogen or diborane, was also examined using emission spectroscopy 
[13-15]. Recently, this type of reactor has been used to investigate the chemistry and kinetics in 
plasmas  with  admixtures  of  hydrocarbons  and  other  reactive  gases  by  infrared  absorption 
spectroscopy [16,17]. 

An  separate  field  using  microwave  plasmas  in  non-equilibrium  conditions  is  that  using 
non-stationary  power  incoupling,  for  example,  by  pulse  excitation  or  power  modulation.  In 
principle, non-stationary excitation conditions caused by time dependent energy supply into the 
plasma can be used to manipulate the density and energy distribution of electrons and to achieve 
modified  chemical  equilibria  [18,19].  As  a  result  with  pulsed  plasmas  higher  chemical 
conversion rates but also improved etching and deposition processes can be realized [20-24]. The 
thermal influence on sensitive substrates can be controlled by changing the duty cycle. 

The investigation of plasma physics and chemistry in situ requires detailed knowledge of 
excitation  and  relaxation  phenomena  and  of  plasma  parameters,  which  can  be  obtained  by 
appropriate diagnostic techniques complemented by modelling approaches.  

Recently  the  time  evolution  of  rotational,  vibrational  and  kinetic  temperatures  using 
emission spectroscopy from pulsed H2 microwave plasmas generated in a planar travelling-wave 
reactor was reported [25]. In microwave surface wave discharges the degree of dissociation of H2 
was  found to be  much  higher under pulsed  conditions (1kW peak power) than  in a continuous 
mode (1 kW cw) for the same power [26]. Hence modelling of a H2-CH4 microwave discharge 
showed that the concentration of different hydrocarbon radicals can be controlled by duty cycle 
ratio [27]. Ashida et al. studied the breakdown in pulsed argon discharges. The authors described 
how  the  high  electric  field  at  breakdown  leads  to  an  enhancement  of  the  ionisation  frequency, 
and therefore to an increase of the electron density compared to continuous mode operation [28]. 
Spatial analysis of the plasma  ignition  in  a circular radiative slotted waveguide reactor showed 
that, even when the electron density is nearly uniform at the steady state, the discharge ignites in

very specific places [29]. In contrast to the many studies of pulsed RF plasmas, systematic time 
resolved  investigations  of  pulse-modulated  microwave  discharges,  in  particular  concerning 
properties of the electron component, are relatively uncommon. The need for a better scientific 
understanding  of  phenomena  in  pulsed  molecular  microwave  plasmas  must  be  based  on  an 
improved knowledge of plasma ignition including the typical time behaviour of plasma density 
formation. 

The  present  article  describes  temporally  and  spatially  resolved  Langmiur  probe 
diagnostic  studies  of  electron  density  and  electron  temperature  in  pulsed  modulated  hydrogen 
discharges  in two different planar  microwave reactors (fmicrowave= 2.45 GHz), (i)  in a  standing-
wave radiative slotted waveguide reactor and (ii) in a modified travelling-wave radiative slotted 
waveguide reactor [5]. 

Although the Langmuir probe technique is an intrusive method it provides one of the few 
approaches for acquires information about the electron parameters in the plasma. In particular, in 
numerous low pressure DC and RF discharges electrical probes have been successfully applied. 
Several robust theories have been proposed since the early work of Langmuir in the 1920(cid:146)s [30]. 
The  bases  of  modern  theories  were  set  by  the  work  of  Allen  et  al.  [31]  and  Bohm  [32]  and 
extended  by  Laframboise  [33]  and  Chen  [34].  None  of  these  theories  take  into  account  ion-
neutral collisions across the sheath. However, under the experimental conditions relevant in this 
study,  the  electrostatic  sheath  surrounding  the  Langmuir  probe  is  collisionally  dominated.  For 
this  reason  the  analysis  of  the  experimental  data  in  this  paper  is  referred  as  to  the  collisional 
probe theory, proposed by Zakrzewski et al. [35].  
 
 

2. EXPERIMENTAL  
 
2.1. Plasma reactors 

The experiments were performed in two different planar reactors; a standing-wave slotted 
waveguide  reactor  (abbreviated  as  the  SWG  reactor),  Figure  1(a),  and  a  modified  travelling-
wave  slotted  waveguide  reactor  (abbreviated  as  the  TWG  reactor),  Figure  1(b),  [5].  In  both 
cases, the microwave generators used worked in pulsed mode and were externally triggered by a 
pulse generator. The length of a whole period was chosen as 10 ms for the experiments with the 
SWG  reactor  and  50  ms  for  the  TWG  reactor.  Under  both  experimental  conditions  the  pulse 
length was 1 ms. 
The  general  properties  of  linear  radiating  applicators,  guiding  the  microwave  energy  into  the 
plasma chamber, have been described in detail elsewhere [5,7,36]; only a brief account is given 
here.  
 
SWG reactor: 
The  applicator of  the  SWG  reactor  is  shown  in  Figure  1(a). It  consists  of  a  waveguide  (length 
54 cm) terminated by a shorting circuit that establishes a standing wave. The microwave power 
is injected into the plasma chamber via 5 resonant slots that act as dipole radiators. Each slot is 
6.1 cm  long (half the  microwave wavelength  in  vacuum) and  is separated  from another slot by 
half a microwave wavelength in the waveguide (8.7 cm). The angle between the slot axis and the 
waveguide axis  is 20(cid:176). The radiating waveguide  is  located 3 cm above a quartz window of 9.3 
cm  width  that  closes  the  plasma  chamber.  The  plasma  is  generated  directly  under  this  quartz 
window. The grounded walls of the plasma chamber are made of copper and stainless steel. The 
reactor width is 13 cm. A microwave generator, Sairem GMP 12KE, provided 600 W of power 
in  the  pulse  with  a  rise  time  of  40 (cid:181)s.  The  incident  power  was  zero  between  the  pulses.  The 

 

3

surface of the plasma region  in the plane  below the quartz window  is typically about 350 (cid:150)400 
cm2. Details of the pulse regime can be seen in Figure 2.

Figure 1: The  different planar microwave reactors: The applicator of the SWG reactor consists of 5 
slots  (1a),  the  applicator  of  the  TWG  reactor  of  26  holes  with  coupling elements  and  an  additional 
smoothing interface waveguide (1b). 
 
 
TWG reactor:   
Because  the  applicator  of  the  TWG  reactor  takes  advantage  of  having  a  local  distributed  and 
tuneable coupling of the microwave power combined with an additional smoothing, considerably 
homogeneous plasma excitation can be achieved over a large surface, typically up to 500 cm2. A 
scheme of the T-shape configuration of the applicator consisting of two rectangular waveguides, 
the distributor waveguide and the  interface waveguide,  is shown  in  Figure 1(b). The discharge 
chamber has dimensions of 25*20*140 cm3 (W*H*L). The microwave power is radiated via 26 
coupling  holes  separated  from  each  other  by  a  distance  of  λ/4  (=3.8 cm).  In  order  to  tune  the 
power and to improve the coupling efficiency these holes contain  moveable  metallic  hooks. At 
each end of the  interface waveguide  a  matched  load leads to the existence of travelling waves. 
The  dimensions  of  the  waveguides  are  those  of  type  R22  (a:b=2:1  with  a=11cm).  A  quartz 
window, which allows the microwave power to penetrate into the discharge chamber, forms the 
fourth mechanical wall of the interface waveguide. When a plasma is generated it represents the 
fourth conducting wall of the interface waveguide.  
 
rise time of between 20 and 40 (cid:181)s. The minimum power between the pulses was 600 W. 
 
2.2. Langmuir probe system 
A  single,  cylindrical  Langmuir  probe  was  used  for  electron  density  and  temperature 
determinations. The probe was mechanically moveable  in the discharge reactors (see Figure 1) 
and electrically controlled by an acquisition system, DIGIPROBE obtained from the Jobin-Yvon 
Horiba Group. The scan range of the probe voltage was ± 190 V and the maximum probe current 
was  limited  to  100 mA.  The  DIGIPROBE  acquisition  system  permits  time  resolved  electron 
density  measurements  to  be  made  with  a  minimum  time  resolution  of  30 (cid:181)s.  A  TTL  pulse, 
synchronised with the microwave pulse, triggers the system. After the trigger pulse the probe tip 
is  polarised  with  an  adjustable  delay  related  to  the  microwave  pulse,  and  the  probe  current 
measured (Figure 2). The probe voltage  is then reset to 0 V in order to avoid ohmic  heating of 
the  probe,  which  can  occur  in  higher  density  (1012 cm-3)  plasmas.  The  current  measurement  at 
the  same  probe  voltage  can  be  repeated  over  many  pulses  in  order  to  average  the  signal.  The 
probe characteristic is achieved by varying the polarisation (typically from (cid:150)50 to +25 V).  

A microwave generator, Sairem 60KE/DC, provided 3.6 kW of power in the pulse for a

For pulsed  measurements, it  is often necessary to average  many probe characteristics  in 
order  to  obtain  a  good  signal  to  noise  ratio  (typically  20-100).  Ordinary  cylindrical  Langmuir 
probes  made  of  a  tungsten  tip  inside  a  dielectric  capillary  gave  no  relevant  results  in  the 
microwave  reactors  used  in  this  study,  since  these  probes  are  strongly  perturbed  by  the 
electromagnetic  field  of  the  microwaves.  Therefore,  a  special  shielded  probe  made  of  a  micro 
coaxial arrangement was used. It consisted of a copper layer on floating potential surrounding its 
dielectric  of  1 mm  radius.  The  tip  radius  and  length  are  0.25  mm  and  3-7 mm,  respectively. 
Figure  3  presents  characteristics  of  two  different  probes.  One  was  recorded  using  an  ordinary 
tungsten  tip  inserted  into  an  aluminium  capillary,  and  the  other  was  obtained  by  the  shielded 
probe. In the latter the electron current increases exponentially with the applied voltage, up to the 
plasma  potential,  and  then  saturates.  The  unshielded  probe  characteristic  shows  completely 
different behaviour. The electronic part is no longer exponential but linear and increases without 
any saturation like the classical characteristics of a DC discharge.

probe (solid line) and an ordinary tungsten/alumina probe (dashed line). 
 

The  use  of  the  shielded  micro  coaxial  probe  has  lead  to  an  enormous  improvement 
because  electromagnetic  perturbation  can  be  completely  eliminated  in  the  case  of  the  SWG 
reactor.  However,  some  perturbation  of  the  probe  characteristic  still  remained  in  the  TWG 
reactor, caused by the essentially higher peak power of 3.6 kW. 

In the TWR reactor the Langmuir probe could be moved in 3 dimensions (x, y, z). In the 
SWG reactor, only axial (z axis) and vertical measurements (x axis) have been performed. Scans 

5

along the x axis were carried out at two distances from the quartz window: x = 0.3 cm and x = 
2.5 cm.  

In both reactors the hydrogen flow rate was measured on mass flow controllers. The total 
flow rate was kept constant at a few sscm to avoid introducing gas impurities into the discharge 
chamber. The pumping speed was adjusted with a butterfly valve to maintain a constant pressure 
in the plasma and the pressure measured on a capacitance pressure gauge. The pressures were 33 
Pa and 55 Pa for the SWG and TWG reactors respectively. 
 
 

3. PROBE THEORIES AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURE  
 

Since the present experimental study was mainly focused on the mapping of two different 
large  volume  plasma  reactors,  and  concerned  with  the  internal  distributions  of  the  time 
dependence of the plasma density and the mean energy of the electrons, an analysis of electron 
energy  distribution  functions  was  not  performed.  Further  more  it  is  not  intended  to  discuss 
various  electrostatic  probe  theories  in  this  paper,  and  only  a  brief  account  of  the  fundamental 
principles is given here.  

The plasma density is deduced from the ion saturation current, mainly because the ionic 
branch  of  the  electrostatic  probe  characteristic  is  less  sensitive  to  electromagnetic  disturbances 
than  the  electron  one.  In  the  present  work  the  pressures  are  relatively  high,  33  and  55  Pa. 
Additionally,  the  relatively  large  probe  radius  of  0.25  mm  leads  to  collisions  of  ions  with 
neutrals, since the width of the sheath is directly related to the probe radius. Therefore a suitable 
collision theory is used as described below.  

Several  theories  have  dealt  with  the  problem  of  analysing  the  probe  current  since  the 

early work of Langmuir [30]. Two major theories are often used:  

(i)  Assuming  conservation  of  both  angular  momentum  and  ion  energy  Laframboise 
developed  a  self-consistent  theory  of  ion  collection  by  cylindrical  and  spherical  probes.  This 
theory  used  the  two-body  central-force  equations  in  order  to  determine  orbits  of  the  ions  for 
different values of Ti / Te (Ti: ion temperature, Te: electron temperature) [33]. Within this theory 
some  of  the  ions  that  enter  the  probe  sheath  are  only  deflected  by  the  attractive  potential  and 
escape without reaching the probe. Laframboise theory holds as long as no ion collisions inside 
the sheath occur, which is the case for very low pressures and high plasma densities. 

(ii) The other theory is based on the assumption that cold ions (Ti / Te = 0) move radially 
toward the probe, which means that all ions entering the probe sheath reach the probe tip. It was 
shown  by  Allen  et  al.  that  this  is  valid  for  spherical  probes  but  not  for  cylindrical  ones  [31]. 
Nevertheless,  Chen  used  this  assumption  also  for  cylindrical  probes  [34].  Measurements  with 
such probe geometry may often be interpreted with more accuracy by Chen(cid:146)s theory than by the 
approach  of  Laframboise,  due  to  destruction  of  the    orbital  motion  of  the  ions  by  collisions. 
Actually,  this  (cid:147)radial  motion(cid:148)  theory  is  valid  for  a  cylindrical  probe  as  long  as  the  number  of 
collisions across the sheath is small (typically less than one), but not zero. 

As noted above, in our experiments the gas pressure was 33 and 55 Pa depending on the 
reactor.  Under  these  circumstances  the  sheath  has  to  be  considered  as  no  longer  free  of 
collisions.  As  shown  in  the  following  section,  typical  values  of  the  plasma  density  are  in  the 
range  of  2× 1010  to  6×1011 cm-3  and  of  the  electron  temperature  from  2  to  7  eV.  Assuming  a 
sheath width of ten times the Debye length, the sheath width ranges from 300 to 500 (cid:181)m. Thus, 
+ with H2 are likely, since the mean free path length of 
collisions and momentum transfers of H3
+  is  about  130 (cid:181)m  at  55  Pa  and  1000 K,  which  is  smaller  than  the  width  of  the  electrostatic 
H3
sheath. Therefore, the theory excluding collisions should be corrected in order to take this effect 
into account. A parametric synthesis of these two theories has been proposed by Zakrzewski et

al. [35] for cylindrical probes collecting positive ions. The ion current I of this theory is derived 
from the Laframboise ion current IL by 

I = γ1γ2IL 
 

 

 

 

 

  

        (eq. 1) 

Where γ1 is the rate of increase of the Laframboise ion current due to destruction of the orbital 
motion  of  the  ions  and  is  evaluated  from  Chen(cid:146)s  ion  current.  The  parameter  γ2  is  the  rate  of 
decrease of the Laframboise ion current by scattering of ions out of the probe sheath according to 
Schultz  and  Brown  [37]  and  Jakubovski  [38].  For  details  of  the  ion  density  determination 
according to this theory see [39,40]. 

In  the  present  study  the  electron  temperature  is  deduced  from  the  slope  of  the  second 
derivative  of  the  electron  current  (total  probe  current  minus  extrapolated  ionic  current).  In  all 
experiments reported in this paper the following relationship  

Ke(Ke+1)(Ke+ln(lp/rp))-1 > 1   
 

 

 

 

 

          (eq. 2) 

was valid (Ke = λe/rp - electron Knudsen number with λe electron mean free path, rp probe radius, 
lp probe length): 
As a consequence, it was possible to extract the plasma potential from the voltage value, where 
the second derivative of the total probe characteristic is zero, even when the sheath surrounding 
the probe is not free of collisions [41]. The accuracy of the ion density or electron temperature 
determined by the methods described above is no better than 20 % [39]. 
 

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

4.1. Spatial plasma density gradients at the stationary state 
4.1.1. SWG reactor 

We first discuss the spatial profiles of Ne and Te in the stationary state, that is, at the end 
of the 1 ms pulse (Figure 2). Figure 4 shows axial distributions of (a) the electron density and (b) 
of  the  electron  temperature,  at  two  different  distances  from  the  quartz  window  in  the  SWG 
reactor. The delay between the beginning of the pulse and the measurements was set to 850 (cid:181)s in 
order to achieve a steady state (pulse length: 1ms, pulse period: 10 ms)  

The axial electron density profile is not homogeneous; two strong maxima are evident at 
z = 23 cm and z = 33 cm. A third seems to be located very close to the power source (z ≈ 10 cm). 
Each  maximum  occurs  between  two  slots. It  is  clear  that the  electron  density  profiles  are  very 
similar  at  0.3  and  2.5 cm  from  the  quartz  window.  This  means  that  axial  diffusion  along  the  z 
axis does not lead to a smoother profile of the electron density. Close to the quartz window (the 
area of the penetrating  microwaves) the minimum  electron density (z = 18 and 27 cm)  is about 
2×1010  cm-3  and  the  maximum  density  reaches  1.5×1011  cm-3  (7  times  higher).  This  can  be 
correlated with the electron temperature profile (Figure 4(b)). As expected, the electron density 
and  temperature  profiles  have  their  maxima  at  the  same  positions.  The  electron  temperature 
varies very strongly from 2 eV to 7 eV. However, in contrast to the electron density distribution, 
the  electron  temperature  is  very  sensitive  to  the  distance  from  the  quartz  window.  The  lower 
position (2.5 cm) shows that Te is much less modulated (only between 2 and 3.5 eV). This means 
that the microwave electric field, which is very strong and non homogeneous close to the quartz 
window is absorbed by the plasma. The electric field intensity decreases rapidly with increasing 
distance from the quartz window x.

The  electron  density  gradient  is  most  probably  due  to  the  electron  energy  gradient. 
Actually, a rigorous description of the discharge particle and energy  balance would require 3D 
modelling, which is beyond the scope of this paper. However, it is of interest to roughly estimate 
the spatial variation of the ionisation frequency due to the electron energy gradient. Assuming a 
Maxwellian electron distribution function the ionisation frequency can therefore be expressed as,

Figure  5:  TWG  reactor:  steady  state  axial  electron  density  profile  (5(a))  and  electron  temperature

4.1.2. TWG reactor 
Axial measurements: 

Considering now the results obtained in the TWG reactor. Figure 5(a) and 5(b) show the 
axial plasma density and temperature profiles respectively at the steady state, at three different 
distances  from  the  quartz  window.  Operating  conditions  are:  55  Pa,  3.6  kW,  t = 850 (cid:181)s.  The 
plasma  density  profiles  are  also  as  strongly  modulated  as  in  the  case  of  the  SWG  reactor.  The 
plasma density ranges from 5× 1010 to 4.5× 1011 cm-3, which is higher than the values measured 
in  the  SWG  reactor.  However,  the  plasma  density  decreases  as  the  distance  from  the  quartz 
window increases, in contrast to the situation in the SWG reactor. This is most likely due to the 
higher pressure, 55 Pa  instead of 33 Pa, leading to reduced electron diffusion.  At a distance of 
2 cm from the quartz window the electron density shows a decay by a factor of about 2, and at 
5 cm,  it  is  reduced  by  a  factor  of  more  than  20.  This  means  that  the  plasma  itself  (i.e.  the 
collection of charged particles) only spreads over about 3 cm.  

Similarly to the SWG reactor case, the electron energy decreases markedly with distance 
from the quartz window (Figure 5(b)). A very high electron energy, near to 10 eV, is measured at 
z = 6 cm. This can be related to the strong electric field generated by the  high peak power (3.6 
kW).  However,  it  is  important  to  note  that  in  such  a  high  field  region  the  electron  part  of  the 
probe characteristic is disturbed.  
 
Transverse measurements: 
Figure  6  shows  profiles  along  the  y  axis  of  the  TWG  reactor.  The  distance  from  the  quartz 
window  was  0.3 cm.  Two  different  positions  along  the  z  axis  are  considered:  a  bright  plasma 
zone  and  a  dark  plasma  zone  (z = 20.5  cm  and  15.2 cm  respectively  according  to  Figure  5). 
Spatial distributions of the plasma density and electron energy are presented in Figures 6(a) and 
6(b)  respectively.  Measurements  were  performed  ±  3 cm  from  the  reactor  axis.  In  the  scanned 
region  the  electron  density  is  approximately  constant  whereas  Te  is  constant  only  in  the  dark 
zone and exhibits a strong radial profile in the bright zone.

4.2. Time resolved profiles measurements 
4.2.1. Time evolution of ne and Te axial profiles in the SWG reactor 

Figure  7  presents  the  time  evolution  of  the  axial  electron  density  profiles  in  the  SWG 
reactor close to the quartz window (x = 0.3 cm) at four different pulse times (t = 0, 50, 150 and 
850 (cid:181)s). This clearly shows the ignition behaviour of the plasma. At t = 0 (cid:181)s, the plasma density 
is  close to zero everywhere except close to the  microwave power  injection region (z < 10 cm). 
Some  50  (cid:181)s  later  the  plasma  density  is  close  to  its  maximum  value  over  75 %  of  the  reactor 
volume but still remains low for z > 30 cm.

These effects illustrate the propagation of the ionisation front. At t = 150 (cid:181)s, the plasma 
density  has reached  its  maximum  value  in the whole  volume. Figure 7  also shows the electron 
density profile at its steady state (t = 850 (cid:181)s), as presented on Figure 4(a). It is interesting to note 
that in high field regions (z = 10, 23 and 33 cm) the electron density is higher at t = 150 (cid:181)s than 
at t = 850 (cid:181)s.

temperature has almost reached its steady state (except at the end of the reactor (z > 30 cm)).

region) and z = 17.5 cm (low field region) in the SWG reactor (33 Pa, 600W, x = 0.3 cm). 
 

In order to discuss the time evolution of  both electron density and temperature the time 
evolution  of  the  electron  density  at  two  axial  positions  z = 33 cm  (high  field  region)  and 
z = 17.5 cm (low field region) is shown in Figure 9. The experimental conditions were the same 
as  in  Figure  7  and  8.  In  Figure  10  the  time  evolution  of  the  electron  temperature  is  given.  As 
mentioned  above,  Te  reaches  its  stationary  state  almost  immediately,  which  is  too  short  to  be 
observed  with  the  probe  system.  The  overvoltage  causes  the  maximum  of  the  electron 
temperature during the breakdown. In fact, it is well known that when an electromagnetic field is 

 

11

applied  to  a  neutral  gas,  the  breakdown  electric  field  is  much  higher  than  that  required  to 
maintain the plasma in the steady state. Consequently, a high electron temperature during a short 
period of time is observed.

field region) and z = 17.5 cm (low field region) in the SWG reactor (33 Pa, 600W, x = 0.3 cm). 
 

On  the  other  hand,  the  temporal  evolution  of  the  plasma  density  is  much  slower:  Ne 
reaches a  maximum  value  in about 200 (cid:181)s and then decreases smoothly to reach a  steady state 
around 500(cid:181)s. The maximum of the electron density can be explained in two different ways. (i) 
200(cid:181)s after the beginning of the pulse, the volume of the plasma has not yet reached its steady 
state.  Then,  the  power  density  is  higher  at  t =  200 (cid:181)s  than  during  the  stationary  state  after the 
expansion of the plasma, which might explain the maximum in the plasma density. (ii) Taking a 
thermal  effect  into  consideration,  the  injected  microwave  power  density  is  high  enough  to 
substantially heat the gas.

Experiments performed in the TWG reactor showed that the gas temperature increased by 
approximately 600 K within 500 (cid:181)s when the power was 3.6 kW [25]. Such gas heating leads to 
a decrease of the neutral particle density as well as of the ionisation frequency, which might also 
explain the maximum of the electron density at t = 200 (cid:181)s.  
 
4.2.2. Time evolution of ne and Te axial profiles in the TWG reactor 

Similar  time  evolutions  of  electron  density  and  temperature  profiles  were  also  found  in 
the TWG reactor. Figure 11 shows the time evolution of the axial plasma density profile (z axis) 
at t = 30, 80 and 810 (cid:181)s. At t = 810 (cid:181)s the stationary state is reached. The time evolution of the 
plasma density in the high and low field region is shown in Figure 13. In the high field region, 
the maximum plasma density value is reached within 60 (cid:181)s. This is shorter than that measured in 
the SWG reactor. This is mainly due to using a minimum power of 600 W between two pulses to 
prevent the plasma density falling to zero. Hence when the 3.6 k W peak power is applied there 
already  exists  a  weak  plasma  which  allows  the  ionisation  front  to  propagate  faster.  It  is  also 
interesting to note that in contrast to that found in the SWG reactor (Figure 9) the plasma density 
does not fall to a zero value in the TWG reactor. In the SWG reactor, the plasma density almost 
reaches zero for a decay time of 30(cid:181)s, which is comparable to the decay time of the microwave 
generator itself. The presence of a maximum of the plasma density at t = 1200 (cid:181)s (200 (cid:181)s after 
the end of the pulse) is discussed in the following section.  
 
4.2.3. Time evolution of ne and Te post discharge  

The residual plasma between two pulses, caused by the remaining 600 W of microwave 
power,  is  apparent  in  Figure  14.  The  time  evolution  of  the  electron  temperature  in  this  figure 
shows a decrease from 6 to 2 eV, which is still a relatively high value. In the case of the SWG 
reactor, the power is zero between two pulses, and Te drops to 0.5 eV in less than 30 (cid:181)s (Figure 
10).

Concerning  the  maximum  of  the  electron  density,  200 (cid:181)s  after  the  end  of  the  pulse 
(Figure 13), we suppose that this is due to the coupling (feed back) between the plasma density 
and the injected power: When the microwave power is decreased from 3600 to 600 W, the decay 
of  the  plasma  density  leads  to  a  time  dependence  for  the  plasma  impedance  and  the  injected 
power.  

It  is  interesting  to  note  that  the  amplitude  of  the  electron  density  is  more  pronounced 
when the collisional theory of Zakrzewski and Kopinczynski [35] rather than the classical non-
collisional  theory  from  Chen  [34]  is  used.  This  interesting  fact  is  actually  due  to  the  time 
evolution  of  the  gas  temperature,  and  the  related  neutral  density  during  the  pulse  and  post 
discharge.  Under  slightly  different  experimental  conditions,  (same  peak  power,  same  gas 
pressure,  but  50 %  instead  of  10 %  duty  cycle  ratio),  the  gas  temperature  was  measured  both 
from  Doppler  broadening  of  H2  Fulcher  lines,  and  from  population  density  distributions  of 
molecular  levels [25,43]. It was shown that the gas temperature is about 600 K between pulses 
(due to the residual 600 W input power), whereas it increases to 1050 K during the 3.6 kW pulse 
itself. Moreover, post discharge, the gas temperature drops with a time constant of about 30 (cid:181)s. 
Therefore,  the  neutral  particle  density  increases  during  the  first  50 (cid:181)s,  which  increases  the 
number  of  collisions  and  decreases  the  correction  factor  γ2    in  eq.  1.  Furthermore  the  factor 
γ1  gives an increase of the Laframboise current in eq. 1 only in the region 0 < rp / λD ≤ 3 where 
λD  is  the  Debye  length.  The  ratio  rp  /  λD    has  a  value  of  about  7  at  this  specific  time  in  the 
afterglow. This explains why Chen(cid:146)s non-collisional probe theory underestimates the maximum 
electron density mentioned above. 
 
 
5. CONCLUSIONS 
 
Time  and  spatially  resolved  plasma  density  and  electron  temperature  measurements  have  been 
performed in two different linear plasma reactors. These experiments were made possible by the 
use of a shielded Langmuir probe, in order to reduce electromagnetic disturbances. For discharge 
pressures near 50 Pa, a probe theory which includes ion/neutral collisions across the sheath has 
to be applied.  
It  was  found  that  in  both  reactors  the  plasma  density  is  strongly  inhomogeneous  close  to  the 
microwave window. Variations from 5 to 10 have been recorded between high density and low 
density regions. Away from the microwave windows, the plasma density decreases and becomes 
more homogeneous due to charged particle diffusion.  
Time resolved density measurements show that the electron density reaches a steady state within 
about  500  (cid:181)s.  It  goes  through  a  maximum  100  to  200 (cid:181)s  after  the  beginning  of  the  pulse. 
Compared to the SWG reactor the steady state is reached earlier  in the TWG reactor, probably 
because  of  the  residual  plasma  which  remains  between  two  pulses  in  this  reactor.  The  time 
evolution  of  the  spatial  plasma  density  profile  shows  that  the  plasma  ignites  preferentially  at 
places near to the microwave power injection points and then propagates from these.  
Although this is the first time that electron densities and temperatures have been analysed with 
both  temporal  and  spatial  resolution  in  two  planar  microwave  reactors,  it  is  clear  that  the 
extension of the present studies to the  measurement of electron energy distribution  functions  is 
desirable for a more comprehensive understanding of the excitation phenomena in these plasmas. 
This includes the verification of the measured parameters of the electrons by other independent 
methods,  e.g.  microwave  interferometry  or  Thompson  scattering,  to  improve  the  modelling 
potential of pulsed molecular microwave plasmas.

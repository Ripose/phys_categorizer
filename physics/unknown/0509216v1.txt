Abstract 
 
We  demonstrate  that  a  minor  modification  of  the  extrapolation  proposed  by  Jensen 
[(2005):  Theor  Chem  Acc  113:267]  yields  very  reliable  estimates  of  the  Hartree-Fock 
limit  in  conjunction  with  correlation  consistent  basis  sets.  Specifically,  a  two-point 
 yields HF limits EHF,∞ with 
extrapolation of the form
an RMS error of 0.1 millihartree using aug-cc-pVQZ and aug-cc-pV5Z basis sets, and of 
0.01 millihartree using aug-cc-pV5Z and aug-cc-pV6Z basis sets.  
 
Keywords: Basis set convergence, Hartree-Fock limit, extrapolation formulas, 
correlation-consistent basis sets 
 
Introduction 
 
In a recent paper,1 Jensen considers the estimation of the Hartree-Fock limit from finite 
basis  set  calculations,  using  a  recently  computed  database2  of  numerical  Hartree-Fock 
energies  of  diatomic  molecules  as  a  reference.  He  concludes:  (a)  that  finite  basis  sets, 
particularly his own polarization consistent (pc-n) basis sets,3 can approach the Hartree-
Fock limit very closely; (b) that their limiting convergence is very well described by an 
extrapolation formula of the form

where L is the highest angular momentum present in the basis set and ns the number of s-
type basis functions for the heaviest atom present.  

Jensen  also  found  that  this  formula  works  rather  less  well  for  the  correlation 
consistent (cc) basis sets of Dunning and coworkers,4,5 which are commonly used in high-
accuracy ab initio thermochemistry calculations (e.g., in W1/W2/W3 theory6 and in the 
HEAT project7). He ascribed this both to the intrinsic nature of the cc basis sets — which 
were  optimized  for  recovering  correlation  energy  —  and  to  the  fact  that  ns  does  not 
change smoothly in the cc-pVnZ series. 

Normally,  however,  ns  will  be  roughly  proportional  to  L  in  a  sequence  of  basis 
sets with increasing L. We will show below that substitution of L for ns leads to an SCF 
extrapolation formula that yields highly satisfactory SCF limits from aug-cc-pVnZ basis 
sets, provided these are of at least aug-cc-pVQZ quality.

Methods 
 
All calculations were carried out using MOLPRO8 running on the Martin group’s Linux 
cluster at the Weizmann Institute of Science. All energies were converged to at least 10 
decimal places, and integral screening thresholds adjusted accordingly. Restricted open-
shell Hartree-Fock was used for the open-shell species. 

We  carried  out  SCF  calculations  for  the  molecules  in  Ref.2,  at  the  reference 
geometries  given  there,  using  the  aug-cc-pVnZ  and  aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z  basis  sets 
(n=D,T,Q,5,6)  on  first-  and  second-row  atoms,  respectively.  (In  the  remainder  of  the 
article,  the  notation  AVnZ  is  used  for  brevity.) These  latter  basis  sets5  contain  an  extra 
high-exponent d function for second-row atoms, in order to recover “inner polarization” 
effects.9  For a subset of molecules, we additionally carried out calculations with the aug-
pV7Z basis sets of Valeev et al.:10 for S2 and SO, we added an additional high-exponent d 
function by multiplying the highest d already present by a factor of 2.5. The AV(6+d)Z 
and AV7Z basis sets were obtained from the EMSL Basis Set Library.11 
 
Results and discussion 
 
A complete sets of total energies can be obtained from the authors, while a summary of 
error statistics and parameters can be found in Table 1. 

The raw AVnZ RMS (root mean square) errors decay from 2 millihartree with the 
AVQZ basis set to 316 and 57 microhartree, respectively, for the AV5Z and AV6Z basis 
sets. The uncontracted aug-pc3 and aug-pc4 basis sets display RMS errors of 358 and 81 
microhartree,  respectively  —  one  should  keep  in  mind  these  actually  have  Lmax  a  step 
lower than AVnZ basis sets of comparable quality. 

The  A+B/L5  extrapolation  used  in  W1  theory  performs  quite  well  from  the 
AV{T,Q}Z basis set pair actually used there (339 microhartree, comparable to the AV5Z 
basis  set)  but  clearly  overshoots  the  mark  for  larger  basis  sets  —  the  errors  of  574  and 
118  microhartree, respectively,  for  the  AV{Q,5}Z  and  AV{5,6}Z  pairs  actually  exceed 
those  of  the  raw  AV5Z  and  AV6Z  results,  respectively.  For  the  the  aug-pc{3,4}  basis 
sets,  the  A+B/  L5  extrapolation  results  in  an  RMS  error  of  64  microhartree,  not  much 
better than the raw aug-pc4 result. 

Three-point  geometric  extrapolation  with  the  AV{T,Q,5}Z  basis  sets  yields  an 
RMS error of 344 microhartree, which is inferior to the raw AV5Z data (although it errs 
on  the  opposite  side  from  A+B/L5).  The  same  extrapolation  from  AV{Q,5,6}Z  data 
reduces error to 27 microhartree, which does represent an improvement on the raw data. 
Using the equation 
an RMS error of 41 microhartree (and an average γ of 8.11).  

 instead as a three-point extrapolation, we find 

Let us now consider empirical two-point extrapolations, first of the form A+B/Lα, 
where α is an effective decay exponent obtained by minimizing the RMS error. From the 
AV{T,Q}Z  pair  we  obtain  α=5.34  for  a  respectably  small  RMS  error  of  206 
microhartree. For the AV{Q,5}Z pair α=8.74 with an RMS error of 128 microhartree; for 
the AV{5,6}Z pair (with α=9.43) this can be brought down to a paltry 10 microhartree — 
basically exact for all thermochemical purposes.  

Two-point extrapolations of the forms

(with β and γ again global parameters) will obviously result in the same RMS errors, as 
all such extrapolations can be written in the form

(with  c1  a  constant).  In  fact,  the  various  exponents  (α  for  inverse  power  law,  β  for 
geometric/exponential,  and  γ  for  the  exponential-√  L  form)  can  easily  be  shown  to  be 
related through the following equalities:

AV{5,6}Z  pair.  For  the  exponential-√L  form,  however,  the  change  in  γ  is  quite  small: 
from 9.03 for the AV{Q,5}Z pair to 8.77 for the AV{5,6}Z pair, a relative change of only 
3%. In fact, using γ=9 for both cases only increases the error from 9.91 to 10.42 for the 
AV{5,6}Z pair, and from 128.48 to 128.51 for the AV{Q,5}Z pair.

of their optimal RMS error (which gives much greater weight to the AV{5,6}Z pair). The 
average  of  both  exponents  is  γ=8.992,  not  significantly  different  from  γ=9.  We  thus 
propose as an SCF extrapolation formula for the aug-cc-pV(n+d)Z basis sets (n≥Q):

What  about  the  uncontracted  aug-pcn  basis  sets?  Two-point  extrapolation  from 
aug-pc3  and  aug-pc4  basis  sets  yields  an  RMS  error  of  only  24  microhartree  (for  an 
optimal  exponent  γ=7.27),  while  a  respectable  88  microhartree  is  obtained  using  the 
comparatively small aug-pc2 and aug-pc3 basis sets (for an optimal γ=11.79). 

Does Eq.(5) hold tolerably well for basis sets larger than AV6Z? If it does, then it 
should  give  good  predictions  of  the  SCF/aug-cc-pV(7+d)Z  energy.  We  have  calculated 
the latter for the following ten molecules: C2, CN-, CO, F2, FH, N2, NO+, O2, S2, and SO. 
(The  k  functions  were  omitted  for  technical  reasons:  consideration  of  the  f,  g,  h  and  i 
function  contributions  for  the  AV7Z  basis  sets  —  which  decay  by  about  an  order  of 
magnitude apiece — suggests the k function contribution to the SCF energy is an order of

on the order of 1-2 microhartrees cannot be ruled out for the second-row species.)  

RMS  deviation  between  predicted  and  actual  AV7Z  SCF  energies  is  5.4 
microhartree,  suggesting  that  our  equation  works  tolerably  well  even  in  that  region.  A 
two-point  AV{6,7}Z  extrapolation  with  an  optimized  α  parameter  (α=8.18,  γ=7.10) 
yields  an  RMS  error  of  only  3.5  microhartree  for  the  SCF  limits,  compared  to  15.4 
microhartree  for  the  raw  AV7Z  energies.  However,  inspection  of  the  individual  errors 
reveals  that  the  two  second-row  species,  S2  and  SO,  are  outliers  (possibly  because  of 
neglect  of  k  function  contributions  to  the  AV7Z  energies).  Upon  eliminating  them  and 
reoptimizing, we find an RMSD of only 1.5 microhartree (α=9.06, γ=7.80), compared to 
10.3 microhartree for raw AV7Z. For the first-row species, Eq.(5) has an RMSD of just 
3.1 microhartree. 

Finally,  we  note  that  our  effective  decay  exponents  for  the  large  basis  sets  are 
considerably  smaller  than  those  previously  obtained  by  Schwenke12  for  a  much  smaller 
sample of systems. His study was primarily concerned with basis set convergence of the 
correlation  energy,  and  his  SCF  energies  are indeed  converged  to  his  stated  goal  of  10 
microhartree. However, numerical Hartree-Fock calculations with the 2DHF program13 at 
his reference geometries revealed that his estimated HF limits were on average about 10 
microhartree above the true limits14 — quite enough to affect the effective exponents for 
AV{Q,5}Z and AV{5,6}Z basis set pairs. 
 
Conclusions 
 
While  the  polarization  consistent  basis  sets  are  extremely  valuable  in  Hartree-Fock  and 
DFT  calculations,  it  is  quite  possible  to  obtain  reliable  Hartree-Fock  limits  from  SCF 
energies  obtained  with  (sufficiently  large)  correlation  consistent  basis  sets  using  Eqs. 
(4,5). This  is  particularly  relevant for  accurate  ab  initio  computational  thermochemistry 
work, where these basis sets are commonly used because of their efficiency in recovering 
valence  correlation.  We  recommend  that  eq.  (5)  be  used  instead  of  A+B/L5  in  W2  and 
W3 calculations; for W1, A+B/L5 is close to optimal.

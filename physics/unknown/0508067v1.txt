A  wedge-shaped  structure  made  of  split-ring  resonators  (SRR)  and  wires  is 

numerically  simulated  to  evaluate  its  refraction  behavior.  Four  frequency  bands, 

namely,  the  stop  band,  left-handed  band,  ultralow-index  band,  and  positive-index 

band, are distinguished according to the refracted field distributions. Negative phase 

velocity inside the wedge is demonstrated in the left-handed band and the Snell’s law 

is  conformed  in  terms  of  its  refraction  behaviors  in  different  frequency  bands.  Our 

results confirmed that negative index of refraction indeed exists in such a composite 

metamaterial and also provided a convincing support to the results of previous Snell’s 

law experiments.

Ⅰ. INTRODUCTION 

Left-handed materials (LHM) with simultaneously negative electric permittivity 

ε and magnetic permeability µ have attracted a great deal of attention in recent years 

due  to  their  unique  electromagnetic  responses  which  can  not  be  expected  from 

naturally  occurring  materials  [1-4].  Since  the  first  LHM  consisting  of  metallic  split 

ring resonators (SRR) and wires was reported [4], numerous investigations have been 

conducted  both  theoretically  as  well  as  experimentally  to  better  understand  such 

composite structures.    Several methods have been used to verify whether or not such 

a proposed structure possesses negative index of refraction. The effective ε and µ can 

be  deduced  by  averaging  the  electromagnetic  field  in  a  unit  cell  with  appropriate 

boundary  conditions  [5,6],  while  Smith  et  al.  numerically  calculated  them  by 

analyzing the scattering parameters (i.e., the transmission and reflection coefficients) 

[7].  In  addition,  there  are  also  several  alternative  ways  to  confirm  whether  or  not  a 

proposed  structure  is  an  LHM,  such  as  the  Snell’s  law  experiment  [4],  flat-slab 

imaging  [8],  negative  beam  shift  [9],  negative  Goos-Hanchen  shift  [10],  reversal 

Cherenkov radiation, and reversal Doppler shift. The most interesting property of an 

LHM  is  the  negative  index  of  refraction,  i.e.,  the  incident  wave  will  be  bent  to  the 

same  side  of  the  surface  normal  as  that  of  the  incident  wave,  while  for  normal 

materials,  the  beam  should  be  refracted  to  the  opposite  side  of  the  surface  normal. 

Therefore,  one  of  the  most  intuitive  verifications  of  an  LHM  is  the  Snell’s  law 

experiment  on  wedge-shaped  structures.  Experimental  results  showed  that  the 

electromagnetic wave was indeed refracted to the same side of the refraction surface 

 

2

normal as that of the incident wave [4,11,12].   

Previous  Snell’s  law  experiments  were  mostly  performed  in  a  two-dimensional 

scattering chamber with two parallel conducting plates to force the polarization of the 

electric field to be perpendicular to them and putting microwave absorbers laterally to 

reduce  spurious  reflections.  However,  such  a  measurement  is  not  easy  to  perform, 

hence,  its  result  has  been  questioned  [13]  because  the  metallic  metamaterial  is  very 

lossy and there is no well-defined beam in the realized left-handed band (very narrow 

bandwidths  in  microwave  region)  [14].  Furthermore,  although  the  results  of  these 

experiments  [4,11,12]  are  affirmative,  the  LHM  interpretation  for  the  composite 

metamaterial  comprising  SRR  and  wires  has  been  confronted  by  some  researchers 

[15].  In  view  of  the  above,  numerical  evaluation  of  such  Snell’s  law  experiments  is 

valuable  since  it  can  describe  the  refracted  field  distributions  more  clearly  and  can 

obtain  the  phase  information  inside  the  composite  metamaterial.  To  the  best  of  our 

knowledge, previously simulated wedges were mostly regarded as continuous media 

with  given  negative  real  parts  of  ε  and  µ  rather  than  simulating  the  real  composite 

metamaterial  itself  [12,16,17,18].  There  are  other  simulations  on  negative  refraction 

of wedge-shaped photonic crystals in the literature [19], which are physically different 

from LHM principle, although both of them lead to negative refraction phenomenon. 

In  this  work,  a  wedge-shaped  structure  comprising  copper  SRR  and  wires  has  been 

directly investigated using full-wave simulation to gain a better understanding on its 

negative 

refraction  behavior.  Our  numerical 

results  provide  as  a  strong 

complementary  support  to  previous  experimental  results  on  negative  refraction  of 

 

3

such metamaterials from the Snell’s law experiments. 

Ⅱ. NUMERICAL MODEL 

The  unit  cell  of  the  composite  metamaterial  is  shown  in  Fig.  1(a)  with  lattice 

parameters  similar  to  those  used  in  Refs.  [12,20].  However,  here  we  used  a  wider 

continuous  wire  instead  of  a  second  wire  in  the  unit  cell  to  generate  sufficient 

negative  ε  [21].  Figure  1(b)  is  the  configuration  used  to  simulate  the  negative 

refraction  behavior  of  the  wedge-shaped  composite  metamaterial.  The  wedge  is 

positioned between two magnetically conducting plates (perfect magnetic boundaries). 

We  use  two  magnetically  conducting  plates  instead  of  two  conventional  electrically 

conducting  plates  because  the  latter  requires  more  computer  resource  to  reach 

sufficient  accuracy  and  hence  is  not  computationally  efficient.  The  spacing  between 

these two plates is 3.3 mm (one unit cell). It is not necessary to stack unit cells along 

the  x-direction  in  the  simulation  provided  the  periodic  nature  is  represented  by 

appropriate  periodic  boundary  conditions.  For  the  wedge  model,  12  unit  cells  (39.6 

mm) are used along the y-axis and 7 unit cells (23.1 mm) are used along the z-axis. 

The  refraction  interface  has  a  staircase  pattern  with  two-unit-cell  step  in  the 

y-direction  and  one-unit-cell  step  in  the  z-direction,  which  can  be  referred  to  as  a 

wedge  of  26.6°  since  the  wedge  can  be  approximately  treated  as  an  effectively 

homogeneous medium for wave propagation when the wavelengths are larger than the 

unit  cell  size.  The  semicircular  vacuum  chamber  with  a  radius  of  4.2  cm  is  the 

refraction  section  (refraction  section  with  larger  radius  does  not  influence  the 

refraction  direction,  but  reduces  the  calculation  accuracy  under  the  limitations  of 

 

4

computer resource and run time, as shown in Fig. 5). The rectangular vacuum channel 

is  used  to  guide  the  electromagnetic  wave  to  be  incident  normally  onto  the  first 

interface of the wedge and then propagates into the wedge. Such a one-dimensional 

composite  metamaterial  will  exhibit  LHM  behavior  only  if  the  incident  wave  is 

polarized in an appropriate direction with respect to the SRR and wires. Therefore, the 

incident  wave  is  guided  along  the  rectangular  channel  with  magnetic  field  in  the 

x-direction  (perpendicular  to  the  SRR  plane)  and  electric  field  in  the  y-direction 

(along the wire). 

Ⅲ. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

A. Frequency bands 

Figure 2 is the magnitude distribution of the electric field at the top magnetically 

conducting  plate.    Four  frequency  regions  are  distinguished  within  the  frequency 

range from 13 GHz to 25 GHz. The First frequency region from 13 GHz to 16 GHz is 

the stop band in which εy is negative while µx is positive. Weak intensity transmission 

has  been  found  in  this  stop  band  [Figure  2(a)  at  14  GHz],  which  is  caused  by  the 

surface wave running along the wedge [See Fig. 4(a), note that both εz and µx of the 

wedge  are  positive  in  this  band].  The  second  frequency  region  from  16  GHz  to  18 

GHz  is  the  left-handed  band,  where  the  polarized  incident  microwave  is  refracted 

negatively due to the double negative nature of εy and µx in this band. Figure 2(b) is a 

typical field distribution for this band at 16.6 GHz. The third frequency region from 

18 GHz to 20 GHz is the ultralow-index band, in which the effective refractive index 

is  ultralow  so  that  the  refraction  direction  is  nearly  parallel  to  the  normal  of  the 

 

5

refraction interface [Figure 2(c) at 20 GHz]. Generally, this band is referred to as the 

stop  band  with  negative  εy  and  positive  µx.  However,  in  our  simulations,  this  band 

occurs right at the falling edge of the permittivity versus frequency curve (according 

to the S-parameters simulation, the plasma frequency of this structure is at about 20 

GHz). Therefore, the amplitude of εy in this band is too small (although negative) to 

completely  block  the  transmission  of  the  incident  wave  [21].  Nevertheless,  the 

transmission magnitude in this band is not as strong as in its neighboring frequency 

regions  (see  Fig.  3).  The  fourth  frequency  region  from  20  GHz  to  25  GHz  is  the 

positive-index band where both εy and µx are positive. The effective refractive index in 

this  band  increases  with  frequency  from  ultralow  to  near  unity  [Figure.  2(d)  at  25 

GHz].  This  is  consistent  with  the  theoretical  results  of  Refs.  [7,22].  Based  on  our 

simulation results, one can make two additional remarks: (1) the reflections at the two 

interfaces  of  the  wedge  cannot  be  neglected  because  the  wedge  is  not  impedance 

matched  to  the  vacuum  chamber;  (2)  the  metallic  metamaterial  is  very  lossy, 

especially for waves with frequencies inside in the left-handed band. 

Figure  3  is  the  surface  plots  of  the  magnitude  of  the  electric  field  around  a 

semicircle  of  4  cm  in  radius  (the  concentric  semicircular  edge  of  the  refraction 

chamber  has  a  radius  of  4.2  cm),  from  which  the  overall  field  distribution  as  a 

function of refraction angle and frequency can be visualized. The transmitted intensity 

is  strongly  attenuated  in  the  left-handed  band  as  compared  with  that  of  the 

positive-index  band.  The  larger  loss  is  attributed  to  the  resonant  nature  of  the 

composite metamaterial in the left-handed band.

B. Phase information inside the composite metamaterial 

It is well known that the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in an LHM is 

characterized by its negative phase velocity; in other words, the electromagnetic wave 

appears to move backward. Therefore, if the SRR-and-wire metamaterial indeed has 

LHM behavior as it has been claimed [4], negative phase velocity must be observed 

when  microwaves  propagate  through  the  wedge.  In  our  simulations,  negative  phase 

velocity inside the wedge is demonstrated in any plane parallel to the z-y plane when 

the  propagating  wave  frequencies  are  in  the  left-handed  band.  Figure  4  is  the  field 

distribution  at  the  bottom  magnetically  conducting  plate  at  three  frequencies. 

Backward phase propagation is indeed observed at 16.6GHz as shown by the arrows 

representing the phase propagation direction (plots in planes adjacent to the metallic 

elements gives less obvious phase information due to serious resonant concentration 

of  the  field  around  the  metallic  elements).  Our  simulation  results  provided  a  solid 

support  to  the  LHM  behavior  of  the  composite  metamaterial  consisting  of  SRR  and 

wires. 

C. Snell’s law simulation 

The  Snell’s  law  is  the  basic  description  of  the  refraction  phenomenon  at  a 

boundary between two media with different indices of refraction. The Snell’s is also 

applicable  to  materials  with  negative  refraction  indices.  In  this  work,  three  wedges 

with different angles have been used to confirm that the Snell’s law is obeyed in the 

metamaterials being investigated. As shown in Fig. 5, the refraction chamber in this 

simulation has been extended to the dimensions of 15 cm × 15 cm in order to obtain 

 

7

clearer  pictures  of  the  refraction  angles.  Three  wedges  with  wedge  angles  of  18.4°, 

26.6°, and 45° have been simulated, which correspond to refraction angles of -7°, -10°, 

and -15°, respectively, for a 16.6 GHz incident wave. In Fig. 6, sinθt as a function of 

sinθi is plotted at three different frequencies (16.6 GHz, 20 GHz, and 25 GHz) and a 

linear  dependence  of  these  two  quantities  are  clearly  demonstrated  as  in  the  Snell’s 

law, where θi and θt are the angles of incident and refracted waves with respect to the 

normal  of  the  incident  interface. One  can  see  from  Fig.  6  that  the  incident  wave  is 

refracted  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  Snell’s  law.  Consequently,  by  taking  the 

average  of  the  three  wedges,  the  effective refractive  indices  of  the  simulated  wedge 

can be calculated to be -0.38, 0.005, and 0.90, corresponding to the wave frequencies 

of 16.6 GHz, 20 GHz, and 25 GHz, respectively. 

Ⅳ. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION 

In summary, we report here our simulation results on a wedge-shaped composite 

metamaterial.  Negative  phase  velocity  inside  the  metamaterial  is  indeed  exhibited 

inside  the  left-handed  band  in  which  the  effective  ε  and  µ  are  both  negative. 

Furthermore, simulations on three wedges of different angles have confirmed that the 

Snell’s  law  is  obeyed  in  the  metamaterials  having  negative  refraction  indices.  Our 

simulation results clearly revealed the LHM nature of the metamaterials and provided 

a strong support to those Snell’s law experiments conducted previously.

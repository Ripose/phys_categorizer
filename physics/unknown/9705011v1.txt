Abstract

We analyze the supersymmetry and the shape invariance of the po-
tentials of the (1+1) relativistic oscillators we have recently proposed
[1, 2].

In the general relativity, the geometric models play the role of kinematics,
helping us to understand the characteristics of the classical or quantum free
motion on a given background. One of the simplest (1+1) geometric models
is that of the quantum relativistic harmonic oscillator represented by a free
massive scalar ﬁeld on the anti-de Sitter static background [3, 4]. Recently,
we have generalized this model to a family of quantum models the metrics
of which depend on a real parameter [1]. We have shown [2] that this family
contains a set of models which can be considered as the relativistic correspon-
dents of the usual nonrelativistic P¨oschl-Teller (PT) systems [5, 6]. These
models have been referred as relativistic PT systems [2]. They have countable
discrete energy spectra and the same square integrable energy eigenfunctions
as those known from the nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. However, the
signiﬁcance of the parameters as well as the formula of the energy levels are
diﬀerent. An important property of all these models is that they lead to the
usual harmonic oscillator in the nonrelativistic limit.

These analytically solvable relativistic problems may have similar prop-
erties of supersymmetry and shape invariance as those known from the non-
relativistic theory [7]. Here, our aim is to analyze these properties, pointing

1

out the changes requested by the speciﬁc form of the Klein-Gordon operator
and by the relativistic expression of the energy levels.

Let us start with a short review of the main results concerning the rel-
ativistic PT problem (in natural units, ¯h = c = 1) [2]. There exists an
holonomic frame, (t, x), in which the metrics of our family of models is given
by the line element

where we have denoted ˆω = ǫω understanding that ω isthe frequency of
the harmonic oscillator obtained as the nonrelativistic limit of these models.
Here ǫ is a new parameter which determines the domain of the quantum free
motion, D = (
π/2ˆω, π/2ˆω), for a ﬁxed ω. Note that for ǫ = 1 we obtain
the exact anti-de Sitter metric. Particularly, in the frame (t, x), the scalar
product of the square integrable functions deﬁned on D is just the usual one.
The Klein-Gordon equation of a spinless particle of the mass m has the form

It has a countable discrete energy spectrum. The corresponding square-

The quantum numbers, ns = 0, 1, 2... and s = 0, 1, can be embedded into
the main quantum number n = 2ns + s. This will take even values if s = 0
and odd values for s = 1. Hence, the functions Uns,s(x) are completely

determined by n only. They are real polynomials of the degree n in sin ˆωx,
with the factor cosk ˆωx, which vanishes at x =
π/2ˆω. The energy levels
also depend on the main quantum number. These can be obtained from the
quantization condition

We specify that, for the pure anti-de Sitter oscillator, the resulting energy
spectrum is equidistant [4] since ǫ = 1.

We have seen that the relativistic PT systems depend only on three pa-
rameters, the mass m, the frequency ω and the new parameter ǫ. For our
future needs it is convenient to change this parametrization by using the
parameter k instead of m. Then, from (5) we have

m2 = k(k

with the help of which the quantization condition (6) gives

Moreover, the second term of the left-hand side of Eq.(2), which has been
called the relativistic PT potential [2], can be written now as

VP T (k, x) = k(k

1)ˆω2 tan2 ˆωx.

−

In the following we shall consider that the parameters ω and ǫ remain ﬁxed,
while k is variable. For this reason, and by taking into account that the
eigenfunctions (3) are deﬁned, in fact, only by the main quantum number,
we shall denote Uns,s

Uk,n.

In order to construct the supersymmetric quantum mechanics [7] of the
relativistic PT systems we have to adjust the Klein-Gordon operator (2) so
that its spectrum is

≡

(En

Thus, we obtain the new operator ∆[V ] deﬁned by

which will play here the same role as the Hamiltonian of the nonrelativistic
theory. With its help we can rewrite the Klein-Gordon equation in the form

∆[V−(k)]Uk,n = n(n + 2k)Uk,n

where we have denoted

V−(k, x) =

and the supersymmetric partner of V−

Furthermore, following the standard procedure [7], we can deﬁne the pair of
the lowering and raising operators, Ak and A+

k , having the action

and the commutation rule

Then, the operators ∆ of the systems with superpartner potentials, V− and
V+, can be written as

∆[V+(k)] = AkA+

Let us observe now that these potentials are shape invariant since

V+(k, x) = V−(k + 1, x) + 2k + 1.

Consequently, we can verify that

∆[V+(k)]Uk+1,n−1 = n(n + 2k)Uk+1,n−1.

(21)

(22)

From this equation combined with (12) it results that the normalized energy
eigenfunctions satisfy

AkUk,n =

n(n + 2k)Uk+1,n−1,

A+

k Uk+1,n−1 =

n(n + 2k)Uk,n.

Hence, we have obtained the relation between a pair of models with su-
perpartner potentials. These can correspond to any pair of values k and
k + 1 of our variable parameter. Therefore, if we consider the sequence of
models with k = k0, k0 + 1, k0 + 2, .. (k0 > 1), then the of successive models
are supersymmetric partners. What is interesting here is that the masses of
these models appear as being quantized because of Eq. (7) where k play the
role of the quantum number. On the other hand, we observe that the action
(23) of the operators Ak and A+
k leaves invariant the value of n + k. This
indicates that the operator H, deﬁned by HUn,k = (n + k)Un,k, will commute
with these operators. Finally we note that the very simple form of the shape
invariance here allows one to write any normalized energy eigenfunction as

Uk,n =

k+1...A+

k+n−1Uk+n,0.

(24)

where Uk+n,0 is the normalized ground-state eigenfunction given by (14).

As a conclusion, we can say that our example of relativistic supersym-
metric quantum mechanics of a massive spinless particle follows the same
general rules as in the nonrelativistic case. The unique major diﬀerence is
that the Hamiltonian of the nonrelativistic theory is replaced here by the
operator ∆ which is linearly dependent on the squared Hamiltonian. For
this reason, the commutation relations of the Hamiltonian with the raising
and lowering operators will be diﬀerent too. In our opinion this could lead
to new algebraic properties of the relativistic PT systems.

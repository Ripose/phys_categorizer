We show that a stack of metal-dielectric nanolayers, in addition to the long- and short-range plasmons, guides also 
an  entire  family  of  modes  strongly  confined  within  the  multilayer  –  the  bulk  plasmon  modes.  We  propose  the 
classification scheme that reflects specific properties of these modes. We report experimental verification of the bulk 
plasmon modes by measuring modal indices in a structure made of three pairs of silica(~29nm)/gold(~25nm) layers.

A thin dielectric layer surrounded by metallic claddings is 
known  to  support  the  gap  plasmon  –  a  guided  mode  with 
field 
large  modal 
confinement [1]. In this paper we show that a stack of metal-
dielectric  nanolayers  guides  an  entire  family  of  modes 
strongly  confined  within  the  multilayer  –  the  bulk  plasmon 
modes.  The  bulk  modes  have  very  short  penetration  depth 
into  dielectric  claddings.  Their  modal  indices  are  typically 
large in absolute value and may be both positive and negative 
[2]. We propose a classification scheme that reflects specific 
properties  of  these  modes.  Finally,  we  report  experimental 
verification  of  the  bulk  plasmon  modes  based  on  measuring 
modal  indices  in  a  structure  made  of  three  pairs  of 
silica(~29nm)/gold(~25nm) layers.

The penetration depth Lcl of the guided mode field into a 
cladding  is  defined  by  vacuum  wavelength  λ,  the  modal 
index n*, and the cladding permittivity εcl: 
. 
In a structure with a given εcl, the larger the modal index, the 
shorter  the  penetration  depth  is,  which  typically  leads  to 
stronger mode confinement. In all-dielectric waveguides, the 
modal  index  is  always  smaller  than  the  core  index,  which 
makes such structures inappropriate for deep sub-wavelength 
light  confinement.  Practically,  the  most  tightly  confined 
mode  would  be  supported  by  a  silicon-on-insulator  (SOI) 
waveguide  with  silicon  core  (n≈3.5)  and  silica  (or  even 
vacuum) claddings [3].

Surface  plasmon  polaritons  (SPP)  [4]  propagating  along 
the  interface  between  media  with  permittivities  of  different 
sign (metal and dielectric) are often considered as promising 
candidates  for  development  of  waveguides  with  strongly 
confined  modes.  The  plasmon’s  modal  index  is  determined

field 
penetration  depth  into  metal,  while  the  penetration  into  the 
dielectric  can  be  as  large  as  several  wavelengths.  Thus,  for 
surface  plasmons,  the  light  intensity  distribution  across  the 
interface  is  well  beyond  the  nanoscale.  A  remarkable 
exception is the case of resonant surface plasmons [5] when 
dielectric  permittivities  of  materials  at  different  sides  of  the 
interface  are  exactly  opposite  one  to  another: εm+εd→0  and 
thus n*→∞. In homogeneous media, the field distribution of 
the  resonant  surface  plasmon  is  expected  to  be  confined 

to  sub-wavelength 

|εm|>>εd.  This 

leads

infinitely  close  to  the  interface.  Actual  scale  of  the  field 
distribution  is  defined  by  the  applicability  of  the  concept  of 
dielectric permittivity, that is, by the discrete atomic structure 
of  materials.  At  optical  frequencies,  the  resonant  plasmons 
are possible if the dielectric has huge optical gain [6].  

A  metallic  film  of  thickness  tm  between  dielectric 
claddings  supports  SPPs  at  each  metal-dielectric  interface. 
When the interfaces are brought sufficiently close to another, 
coupling between the individual plasmons leads to formation 
of symmetric and anti-symmetric film modes known as long- 
and  short-range  plasmons  (LRP  and  SRP)  [7,  8].  The 
coupling leads to splitting of the dispersion characteristics of 
the  film  modes.  The  modal  index  of  the  LRP  is  reduced 
compared  to  SPP  approaching  the  index  of  the  dielectric 
claddings:

thickness  can  be  within  the  nanoscale  (10nm),  the  overall 
field distribution of both LRP and SRP is typically extended 
to quite a macroscopic scale. The modal indices of SRP and 
LRP  in  fused  silica  (εd=1.4442≈2.085  [9])/  gold  (εm=-
114.5+11.01i,  [10])  system  at  λ=1550nm  as  functions  of 
metal thickness are shown in the first column of Fig. 1. 

The  splitting  of  modal  index  (and  other  dispersion 
characteristic)  resulting  from  mode  coupling  is  a  universal 
property  of optical  waveguides,  and  it  is  an  electromagnetic 
analog  of  energy  level  splitting  in  quantum  mechanics.  In 
fact,  the  modes  in  a  multilayer  composite  can  be  related  to 
the  combination  of  surface  modes  at  individual  metal-
dielectric  interfaces,  which  are  shifted  and  split  due  to  the 
coupling.  When two thin metallic films are brought close to 
each other, the LRPs and SRPs in these films start to interact 
with each other, leading to the splitting between their modal 
indices.  Accordingly,  the  four  modes  of  the  double-film 
system  will  differ  by  their  symmetry  across  metallic  films 
and  dielectric  gap  between  the  films.  The  mode  with  anti-
symmetric  magnetic  field  distribution  across  the  dielectric 
gap experiences the cut-off when the gap thickness becomes 
of the order of 
. This mode therefore does not exist

in  nanoscale  structures.  The  mode  with  symmetric  field 
distribution  across  the  dielectric  gap,  the  gap  plasmon, 
survives,  and  its  modal  index  increases  as  the  gap  becomes 

thinner.  For  the  case  of  a  nanoscale  dielectric  gap  of

is inversely proportional to the gap size. Note that the modal 
index  of  the  gap  plasmon  greatly  exceeds  that  of  the  short-
range plasmon, providing truly nanoscale mode confinement. 
Similar  modes  exist  also  in  a  gap  between  sharp  metallic 
wedges [11]. Exact dispersion  equations for  modes  in  a gap 
between metallic claddings have been proposed in [12]. The 
modal indices of the coupled gap plasmons, SRP, and LRP in 
double-film structure are illustrated in Fig. 1.

materials with dielectric claddings for |εm|>εd (left) and |εm|<εd 
(bottom right). System geometries are schematically shown in top-
right inset, where blue and yellow regions represent dielectric and 
metal  layers.  Graphs  at  the  left  correspond  to  Au/SiO2  composite 
considered in this work; graphs at the right represent its “negative 
index” counterpart with εm= –1+0.1i and εd=1.4442; λ=1550nm. 
First  vertical  portion  of  the  figure  illustrates  the  appearance  of 
SRP/LRP  doublet  as  a  result  of  splitting  between  two  SPPs  (left) 
and as a result of mode/anti-mode formation (right). Other vertical 
portions illustrate the evolution of the modes in a layered structure 
when  a  metal  layer  is  being  gradually  brought  closer  to  the 
nanolayer stack.  

 

 

 

 

 
As  more  layers  are  added  to  the  structure,  the  collective 
interaction  of  SPPs  leads  to  the  mutual  repulsion  of  modal 
indices. The modes originating from SPP combinations with 
asymmetric  magnetic  field  distributions  across  the  dielectric 
layers  experience  cut-off,  while  the  gap  plasmons  survive, 
and  contribute  to  the  emergence  of  high-index  supermodes, 
strongly  confined  to  the  bulk  of  the  layered  metamaterial. 
Since these bulk supermodes originate from repulsion of the 
gap plasmons, the total number of bulk modes is equal to the 
number of dielectric layers Nd in the multilayer. In addition, 
the  entire  multilayer  may  support  surface  modes  at  the 
interfaces with the dielectric claddings. Similar to SPP, these 
surface supermodes typically have poor confinement, and in 
case of symmetric claddings form LRP and SRP. 

The  surface  modes  behave fundamentally  different  when 
.  Although  a  single  interface  in  this  case  does  not

permittivity medium supports two modes with identical field

distribution  (TM0)  but  different  “handedness”  –  the  relation 
between  the  directions  of  electric  and  magnetic  fields  and 
wavevector of the mode [2, 13] (Fig. 1, at the right). One of 
these modes is a direct “right-handed” analog of a long-range 
plasmon.  The  other  one  is  its  negative-index  “left-handed” 
counterpart.  While  the  analogy  is  not  complete,  negative 
index  medium  is  often  called  optical  anti-matter  [14].  The 
TM0  mode  doublet  at  close  to  the  cut-off  condition  can 
therefore be considered as an example of formation of optical 
mode/anti-mode  pair.  Further  analogy 
the 
formation of an anti-symmetric left-handed gap plasmon in a 
dielectric  gap  between  metallic  claddings  when 
[2, 

is  seen 

in 

m εε <
d

15, 16]. Similar to the case of 

m εε >
d

, absolute value of the 

modal index for the left-handed waves increases as the metal 
interfaces  get  closer.  Naturally,  such  an  increase  of  the 
absolute value of the modal index is accompanied by stronger 
mode confinement.  

The evolution of modal indices of guided right- and left-
handed  modes  supported  by  thin  multilayer  films  with 
dielectric  claddings  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  Note  that  the 
repulsion of indices becomes significant when layers become 
sufficiently  thin  so  that  the  gap  plasmons  in  different 
dielectric layers substantially overlap with each other. Figs. 2 
and 3 further summarize the modal indices of metal-dielectric 
composites  with  25nm  layers  and  dielectric  claddings, 
realized in our experiment.  

Optical  losses  of  the  bulk  plasmon  modes  in  multilayers 
are  larger  than  losses  of  surface  plasmons.  Nevertheless, 
these  modes  are of  significant  interest  to nanophotonics due 
to extremely strong field confinement. Besides light guiding 
by  sub-wavelength  structures,  nanoscale  multilayers  with 
appropriately  patterned  films  are  promising  candidates  for 
development of metamaterials with negative refractive index 
[16-21], as well as for development of nano-sensors.

supported by a single interface is a TM0 mode. The LRP and 
SRP  supported  by  a  thin  metal  film  are  labeled  as  TM0  and 
TM1  modes.  The  gap  plasmon  is  a  TM0  mode.  Such  a  mode 
labeling  scheme  is  perfect  for  the  dielectric  waveguides  but 
causes  some  confusion  when  applied  to  nanoscale  metal-
dielectric  structures.  It  is  a  bit  inconvenient  that  the  same 
label  TM0  is  designated  to  rather  different  electromagnetic 
excitations  such  as  surface  plasmons,  long-range  film 
plasmons,  and  the  gap  plasmons.  Moreover,  two  modes  of 
the  left-handed  metal  strip  are  both  TM0  waves.  Further 
inconvenience  is  that  essentially  the  same  mode  –  the  gap 
plasmon  –  is  labeled  TM0  in  the  structure  with  metallic 
claddings,  and  it  becomes  a  TM2  mode  in  a  structure  with 
dielectric claddings, two thin metallic layers, and the guiding 
dielectric layer. 

Once  the  highly  confined  volume  modes  and  the  film-
plasmon-type modes have distinct properties, it is reasonable 
to  label  them  differently.  In  particular,  in  a  structure  with 
large number of layers, the bulk mode with relatively smooth 
profile  is  reasonable  to  call  the  fundamental  bulk  plasmon 
mode BP0. In the traditional numbering scheme this is a TM2 
mode  because  it  has  two  nodes  close  to  the  interfaces  with 
the  claddings.  Accordingly,  the  bulk  mode  of  order  n  (BPn) 
would  be  labeled  as  TMn+2  in  the  traditional  classification. 
The  labels  such  as  LRP  and SRP should be  reserved for  the 
modes  with 
intensity  maxima  at  multilayer-cladding 
interfaces  which  typically  have  large  penetration  depth  into 
the  dielectric  claddings.  When  dielectric  claddings  have 
different  permittivities,  the  labels  LRP  and  SRP  become 
rather  senseless.  Instead,  conventional  titles  such  as  SPP 
bounded to particular interfaces will be more appropriate.  

To illustrate the proposed classification scheme, Fig. 2 at 
the right shows the complete family of modes in a structure 
with Nd =4 dielectric and Nm=5 metallic layers (all the layers 
are  25  nm  thick).  The  structure  supports  the  long-range 
plasmon  (LRP=TM0),  the  short-range  plasmon  (SRP=TM1), 
and four bulk plasmon modes (BP0…BP3=TM2 …TM5). Both 
LRP  and  SRP  show  large  penetration  into  the  claddings.  In 
contrast,  the  bulk  plasmon  modes  are  confined  within  the 
multilayer  with  minor  fraction  of  optical  power  propagating 
in  the  claddings.  The  fundamental  bulk  mode  BP0  has 
relatively  smooth  field  profile.  For  the  highest  order  bulk 
mode, the field distribution reveals fast oscillations so that it 
has opposite signs in neighboring dielectric layers. Note that 
the modal indices of the bulk plasmon modes can be several 
times  higher  than  the  refractive  index  of  the  dielectric 
material  in  the  multilayer.  The  origin  of  this  surprising 
behavior  is  in  the  coupling-induced  repulsion  of  the  modal 
indices of individual gap plasmons discussed above.   

The  modal  indices  of  guided  modes  in  a  multilayer  with 
alternating 25nm thick layers of gold and silica are shown in 
Fig. 3. As predicted, the number of bulk modes is equal to the 
number  of  dielectric  layers,  and  the  maximal  achievable 
modal index increases with the number of layers increasing. 
For any given number of layers, modes of higher order have 
larger  losses  and  larger  modal  index.  Assuming  the  number 
of  layers  is  approaching  infinity  N→∞,  we  find  the 
dispersion relation for the highest and the lowest order bulk 
plasmon mode (BPN and BP0) by setting periodical boundary 

conditions and requiring that the magnetic field strength has a 
node  in  the  middle  of  every  metal  layer  (BPN)  or  does  not 
have such a node (BP0):

The  variety  of  modes  in  a  nanoscale  metal-dielectric 
multilayer 
to  predict  and  simulate 
is 
numerically,  but 
challenging due to the deep sub-wavelength confinement and 
very high optical losses. In this paper we report, to the best of 
our knowledge, first experimental studies of guided modes in

High-index  material  such  as  silicon  (nSi=3.48)  was  used  to 
match the wavevector of light in free space to the wavevector 
of a guided mode. To access wider range of effective indices, 
semi-cylinder geometry instead of more traditional prism was 
used.  Light  from  a  fiber-coupled  tunable  (1490–1590nm) 
semiconductor  laser  (Photonetics  Inc.)  was  collimated  using 
a  10×  objective.  The  laser  was  tuned  to  the  wavelength  of 
1550nm, which was verified by an optical spectrum analyzer 
(Hewlett-Packard HP70951B). The spectral width of the laser 
radiation  was  below  the  resolution  of  the  spectrometer 
(<0.1nm). The silicon semi-cylinder with a nanoscale metal-
dielectric multilayer was mounted on a rotation stage so that 
the  axis  of  the  cylinder  coincided  with  the  axis  of  rotation. 
Angular reflection spectrum  was measured, and datum were 
plotted as a function of the product nSi⋅Sin(θ), where θ is the 
incident angle. In this scale, locations of the intensity minima 
directly  indicate  the  modal  indices  of  the  guided  modes 
excited through the evanescent light coupling.  

The multilayer structure was designed to consist of three 
pairs of silica(~25nm)/gold(~25nm). With two dielectric gaps 
between  the  three  metal  layers,  the  structure  supports  two 
bulk plasmon modes. The thickness of the layers was chosen 
to  ensure  that the  effective  indices  of  the bulk  modes  are  in 
the  comfortable  for  the  measurement  range  (n*<3.0).  The 
experimental  data  are  shown  in  Fig.  4  at  the  left.  They 
indicate  that  the  structure  supports  modes  with  effective 
indices 2.31 and 2.88 recognized as BP0 and BP1 modes. The 
overall  structure  was  designed  for  measuring  the  modal 
indices  of  the  bulk  plasmon  modes,  while  the  surface 
plasmon  mode  at  the  interface  with  the  substrate  appears  to 
be  over-damped,  and  the  surface  plasmon  at  the  interface 
with  air  has  vanishing  small  evanescent  coupling  with  the 
incident  beam.  By  fitting  the  experimental  data  with 
numerically simulated angular reflection spectra, the best fit 
structure  has  been  identified  as  Si-substrate/33nm-silica/ 
24nm-gold/24nm-silica/26nm-gold/31nm-silica/24nm-gold 

(in  average,  29nm-silica/25nm-gold),  which  is  reasonably 
close to the deposition target numbers. Fig. 4 also shows the 
modes’ profiles in the experimental structure calculated using 
the best fit data for the thicknesses of the layers.

FIG.  4.    Experimental  reflection  data  for  a  silica/gold  nanoscale 
 
multilayer (circles) and theoretical fit (solid line) indicating BP0 and 
 
BP1 modes (top left). The geometry of the experiment (bottom left). 
 
Simulated mode profiles in the experimental structure using the best 
 
fit  thicknesses  of  the  layers  (right).  Solid  lines  correspond  to  the 
 
structure with high-index silicon substrate. Dashed lines show mode 
 
profiles assuming the substrate is silica. 
 
In  conclusion,  we  analyzed  TM-polarized  modes 
supported  by  nanoscale  metal-dielectric  multilayers.  We 
show  that,  in  addition  to  the  long-range  and  short-range 
plasmons  supported  by  thin  films,  there  are  high-index 
guided  modes  strongly  confined  within  the  bulk  of  the 
multilayer. The dispersion relation is derived for the highest 
order  and  lowest  order  modes  in  approximation  of  infinite 
number of layers. New classification scheme is proposed for 
in  nanoscale  metal-dielectric 
the  modes 
multilayers. High-index highly confined modes in a structure 
made  of  thee  pairs  of  gold(~25nm)/silica(~29nm)  layers  are 
experimentally verified.

Abstract

In common nonpolar liquids, such as saturated hydrocarbons, there is a dynamic

equilibrium  between  trapped  (localized)  and  quasifree  (extended)  states  of  the  excess

electron (the two-state model). Using time-resolved dc conductivity, the effect of 1064

nm laser photoexcitation of trapped electrons on the charge transport has been observed

in liquid n-hexane and methylcyclohexane. The light promotes the electron from the trap

into  the  conduction  band  of  the  liquid,  instantaneously  increasing  the  conductivity  by

orders  of  magnitude.  From  the  analysis  of  the  two-pulse,  two-color  photoconductivity

data, the residence time of the electrons in traps has been estimated as ca. 8.3 ps for n-

hexane and ca. 13 ps for methylcyclohexane (at 295 K). The rate of detrapping decreases

at lower temperature with an activation energy of ca. 200 meV (280-320 K); the lifetime-

mobility product for quasifree electrons scales linearly with the temperature. We suggest

that the properties of trapped electrons in hydrocarbon liquids can be well accounted for

using  the  simple  electron  bubble  (Wigner-Seiz  spherical  well)  model.  The  estimated

localization time of the quasifree electron is 20-50 fs; both time estimates are in good

agreement with the "quasiballistic" model. This localization time is significantly lower

than the value of 310±100 fs obtained using time-domain terahertz (THz) spectroscopy

1.

for the same system [E. Knoesel et al., J. Chem. Phys. 121, 394 (2004)]. We suggest that

the THz signal originates from the oscillations of electron bubbles rather than the free-

electron plasma; vibrations of these bubbles may be responsible for the deviations from

the Drude behavior observed below 0.4 THz. Various implications of these results are

discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Detailed knowledge of the properties of excess electrons in dielectric solids and

liquids  is  imperative  for  understanding  the  complex  chemistry  initiated  by  photo-  or
radiation  induced  ionization  in  such  media.  1-7  In  liquids  comprised  of  nonpolar

molecules with no electron affinity, such as saturated hydrocarbons, the excess electron is

in  a  dynamic  equilibrium:  it  neither  dwells  permanently  at  the  mobility  edge  of  the

conduction band of the liquid (as a quasifree electron in simple liquids, such as Ar, Xe,
and  CH3) 5,7  nor  becomes  permanently  trapped  or  solvated,  as  occurs  in  polar  liquids,
such  as  water.  8  Instead,  the  electron  constantly  oscillates  between  the  localized  and

extended states, accessing the latter by a thermal emission from shallow traps, in striking

similarity  to  band-tail  electrons  in  disordered  semiconductors.  In  the  absence  of  polar

and/or readily polarizable functional groups, the attractive interaction of the electron with

the solvent molecules is weak, and the binding energies  Et  of trapped electrons are just
50-250  meV,  1,2 as opposed to 1-2 eV in polar liquids and ammonia.  8-10  The  thermal

energy  k TB

  at  room  temperature  is  ca.  26  meV;  hence  the  ease  of  phonon-activated

emission from the traps. This dynamic view of the electron is the essence of the two-state

model for the electron transport in nonpolar liquids that emerged in the early 1970s. We

address the reader to several reviews of the properties of the electron in such liquids, by
Holroyd,  1,11,12 Schmidt,  2,4,7,13 and others, 3,6,14-17 which provide detailed discussion of

this  model  and  its  variants.  Below,  we  outline  the  main  assumptions  of  the  two-state

model and key experimental observations supporting it.

The  apparent  electron  drift  mobility  µ

e

  in  room  temperature  alkanes  and

cycloalkanes  varies  from  10-2 to 100 cm2/Vs;  the  maximum  mobility  is  observed  for

nearly  spherical  molecules,  such  as  2,2-dimethylpropane,  the  lowest  -  for  long-chain
normal  alkanes,  reaching  <  10-3  cm/Vs  for  amorphous  polyethylene.  2  There  is  a
correlation  between  µ

  and  the  activation  energy  for  the  mobility:  the  higher  the

energy,  the  lower  is  µ

.  1  The  latter  can  be  estimated  assuming  that  the  quasifree

electron,  e f ,  that  exhibits  high  mobility  ( µ

f >10  cm2/Vs)  coexists  with  a  trapped

electron(s),  et   (with  a  low  mobility  typical  for  molecular  ions,  10-4-10-3  cm/Vs).  The

model  seeks  to  estimate  the  probability  Pf   for  the  electron  to  remain  in  the  quasifree

state; the electron mobility is then given by  µ µ

≈

. Typically, a thermal equilibrium

between the trapped and quasifree electrons is postulated. Let  τ

quasifree electron (controlled by the localization/trapping rate) and  τ

 is from that for the residence time  τ

, where  ν is the attempt-to-escape frequency (1012-1014 s 18-

20 or  ν ≈ E ht

  21,22), i.e., the activation energy for the electron mobility, approximately

equals  Et , the trap energy. The latter increases with  V0 , the energy of quasifree electron

at the mobility edge relative to the vacuum. The higher the  V0 , the higher is the energy of

detaching the electron from a solvation cavity into the conduction band.

For liquids in which the activation energy of electron transport is low and  µ

 >

e

1  cm2/Vs,  it  is  possible  to  determine  the  electron  Hall  mobility  µ

mobility measured by d.c. 1,2,4-7,11-14 and a.c. (GHz) 3 conductivities,  µ

H .  Unlike  the  drift

H  is the measure of

the  electron  transport  in  the  extended  state  only  (the  carrier  has  to  move  with  a
considerable  velocity  for  the  Lorentz  force  to  bend  its  trajectory).  15  The  typical  Hall

mobilities determined for liquids composed of nearly spherical alkane molecules are 10-
100 cm2/Vs. 15,23-25 Recently, mobilities of free positrons ( e+ ) in n-hexane and iso-octane

(2,2,4-trimethylpentane)  were  determined  from  the  Doppler  shift  of  their  511  keV
annihilation line,  26 yielding ca. 50 and 70 cm2/Vs, respectively (the mobilities of free
electrons and positrons must be similar). For iso-octane,  µ
H  is ca. 20 cm2/Vs at 270-400
. 25 There are alkane liquids (e.g.,

K, which is ca. 3 times the apparent drift mobility  µ

e

neopentane and 2,2,4,4-tetramethylpentane) for which the two mobilities are virtually the
same.  15,25 It is generally believed that the mobility of quasifree electrons in saturated
hydrocarbons should be of the same order of magnitude as  µ
H , viz. a few tens of cm2/Vs.
Similar estimates (30-400 cm2/Vs) were obtained theoretically, e.g. by means of density

4.

fluctuation model based on the Cohen-Lekner scattering theory, 27 by Berlin et al. 28 More
recently, Mozumder 21,22,29,30 pointed out that in many systems, electron trapping occurs

faster  than  the  relaxation  of  the  electron  velocity  in  the  extended  state,  thereby

dramatically reducing the apparent mobility in the free state from its maximally attainable
value of ca. 100 cm2/Vs (the "quasiballistic" model). For n-hexane, this model predicts
τ

≈ 30 fs and τ

≈ 11 ps. 29

t

Importantly,  there  are  variants  of  the  two-state  model  that  postulate  no
equilibration  between  the  trapped  and  free  electrons.  Schiller  31  and  others  28,32,33

suggested that the binding energies  Et  of localized states follow a normal distribution
 with the dispersion  δEt of ca. 120 meV at 295 K (see
Appendix B in the Supplement 34 and refs. 28, 31, 32 and 33). Since only the states with

around their mean value of  Et

without invoking the thermal equilibria, provided that the changes in the energy  V0  and
the free-electron mobility  µ

F  are taken into account.

While the two-state model captures the most important facet of electron transport

in  nonpolar  liquids  (the  coexistence  of  extended  and  localized  states),  it  has  several

weaknesses. First, the postulated equilibrium of free and trapped electrons has not been

observed experimentally on its assumed time scale. The equilibrium is deduced solely
from the temperature dependencies of average electron properties, such as  µ

 and the

e

rate constants for electron attachment to solute molecules. As far as the latter properties

are  concerned,  it  is  possible  to  formulate  a  self-consistent  two-state  model  without
invoking any equilibria. 28,31-33 Second, the model does not specify the nature of electron

traps,  such  as  their  structure,  availability,  and  energetics;  it  also  does  not  address  the
possibility of trap-to-trap migration. 1,2 Third, it neglects the relaxation of the solvent and

concurrent changes in the transport properties of the electron during its localization and

trapping.

5.

These  recognized  deficiencies  of  the  two-state  model  have  been  brought  to  a

sharp  focus  by  the  recent  time-domain  terahertz  (THz)  spectroscopy  experiments  of
Knoesel et al. 35,36 The authors have interpreted their results as the first direct observation

of a quasifree electron in liquid alkanes. The THz spectra were accounted for by a Drude
≈310±100 fs
model for a dilute free-electron plasma with a damping (scattering) time  τ

d

(for n-hexane and cyclohexane). Obviously, this scattering time cannot be longer than the
trapping  time  τ

f .  In  the  Drude  model  of  an  electron  plasma,  the  mobility  µ

f   of  the

quasifree  electron  is  related  to  the  scattering  time  as  µ

elementary charge and  me
the electron rest mass  me , one obtains an estimate of  µ
more than an order of magnitude greater than the estimates obtained from the Hall 15,23
and  positron  26  mobility  measurements.  If  one  equates  the  scattering  time  τ

≈560 cm2/Vs. 36 This estimate is

d   and  the
f   (as  suggested  by  Knoesel  et  al.)  35,36  and  takes  into  account  that

equilibrium  two-state  model.  Thus,  it  appears  that  the  trapping  time  is  by  an  order  of

magnitude and the detrapping time is by two orders of magnitude greater than predicted
by Mozumder using "quasiballistic" model. 22,29 Furthermore, assuming that the quasifree
electron has thermal velocity, the free path  Λ   of  this  electron  may  be  estimated  from

  1,3 for electron-hole pairs in the n-hexane (ca. 300 Å for

the  static  dielectric  constant  ε ≈ 1 8. ).  Thus,  it  appears  that  electrons  generated  by  the

photoionization of n-hexane would typically avoid the recombination with their parent

holes, in stark contradiction of experimental observations, which suggest that >95% of
the ion pairs recombine geminately. 1,3,36 All of the above illustrates the problem that the
THz  observations  of  Knoesel  et  al.  35,36  present  for  the  current  picture  of  electron

dynamics in saturated hydrocarbons. The root cause of this problem is that the scattering

time (localization time?) for the free electron turned out to be unexpectedly long.

In  this  work,  we  attack  the  problem  from  the  opposite  end:  specifically,  we

estimate  the  residence  time  τ

t   of  the  electrons  trapped  in  neat  n-hexane  and

6.

methylcyclohexane. Knowing these estimates and the equilibrium mobility, it is possible
to estimate the free electron lifetime  τ

t  (ca. 10 ps at 295 K) appear

f . Our estimates for  τ

to  be  in  good  agreement  with  the  detrapping  times  predicted  by  Mozumder;  29  on  the

other hand, these estimates are inconsistent with the estimates obtained from the results
of Knoesel et al. 35,36 In the companion paper, deeper (400-800 meV) traps for electrons

were introduced by addition of polar molecules, and the residence times and energetics
for these traps determined.  40 Once more, simple estimates for detrapping rate worked

well for these modified traps. We demonstrate that the energetics of electron traps, as

determined  from  the  known  optical  spectra  of  electrons  in  alkane  liquids  using  the

spherical well ("electron bubble") model discussed in Sec. V.A correlates very well with

the  activation  energies  of  electron  transport.  The  trapped  electrons  involved  in  the

conduction in liquid alkanes are the same as the electrons observed spectroscopically.

There  appear  to  be  no  inconsistencies  regarding  the  energetics  and  properties  of  such
trapped electrons. We, therefore, suggest that the THz signal observed by Knoesel et al. 36

does not originate from quasifree electrons. Rather, it originates from the oscillations of

the electron bubbles in the THz electric field (Sec. V.C). Simple estimates are given to

corroborate this reinterpretation of the THz data. To reduce the length of the paper, some

figures and sections are placed in the Supplement. The figures with the designator "S"

(e.g., Figure 1S) are placed therein.

Eqs. (4) and (5) have already been derived, albeit in a different form, by Yakovlev
and  co-workers,  6,20,41  who  studied  photoinduced  electron  detachment  from  low-

temperature  hydrocarbons;  the  study  of  room  temperature  liquids  was  prohibited  by
inadequate time resolution of their setup. Balakin et al. 20 used 694 nm photoexcitation of

methylcyclohexane  at  180-185  K  (at  which  µ

  is  ca.  10-3  and  5.5x10-4  cm2/Vs,

respectively), Balakin and Yakovlev 41 obtained  µ τ

≈(4±2)x10-13 and 4.7x10-13 cm2/V,

respectively, which corresponds to  τ

t  of 400±200 and 850 ps and  Λ

respectively. The short free path in low-mobility alkanes suggests that  µ

t  of 16 and 21 Å,
f <30 cm2/Vs,
which Yakovlev and Lukin 41 found unreasonably low, though such estimates are in good
agreement with the subsequently determined  e−  Hall  15,23-25 and  e+  drift 26  mobilities.
The smallness of the product  µ τ

of  electron  transport  22  as  an  indication  of  the  regime  in  which  the  relaxation  of  the
velocity  of  free  electron  takes  longer  than  its  localization.  Yakovlev  and  Lukin,  6
however,  suggested  that  the  product  µ τ
(

f   in  eq.  (4)  should  be  replaced  by  a  sum
)  of  the  mobility-lifetime  products  for  the  "hot"  and  quasifree  electron,

respectively. They speculated that the first term in the latter expression makes the largest
contribution to  ∆A . As stated above, this assumption is not required in the light of the

later  findings;  however,  even  if  that  were  the  case,  the  method  would  still  yield  an
estimate for τ

t  from the above. The greater problem with these previous measurements is
that  the  cross  sections  σ  for  the  electron  photodetachment  were  estimated  from  the

spectra  of  radiolytically  generated  electrons  in  room-temperature  n-hexane  and

methylcyclohexane  (assuming  unity  quantum  yield  for  the  bound-to-continuum
transition). A subsequent study by Atherton et al. 42 indicated that the absorptivity of the
electron in methylcyclohexane at 1 µm increases as the temperature decreases, and this

9.

trend (concurrent with the blue shift of the absorption spectrum) 42 agrees well with the
theoretical analyses in the "bubble model" 9,16,43-47 of solvated electron discussed in Sec.

V.A. This arbitrariness decreases the confidence in the estimates of Yakovlev and co-
workers.  6,20,41 Thus, we aimed to explore the region near room temperature, for which

better estimates of all the parameters involved are available. The additional benefit of

studying this region is the ability to directly compare our estimates with those obtained
theoretically 21,22,29 and from the THz experiments. 35,36 To this end, improvements in the

time resolution and the sensitivity of conductivity measurements were required.

III. EXPERIMENTAL.

n-Hexane and methylcyclohexane (99+%, Aldrich), and isooctane (Baker) were

passed through activated silica gel to remove olefin impurity and, for methylcyclohexane,

0.05 vol % of toluene. From gas chromatography, after the silica gel treatment, n-hexane

still  contained  traces  of  n-pentane,  3-methylpentane,  methylcyclopentane,  and  2,2-

dimethylpentane  (<0.2  vol%  in  total).  The  methylcyclohexane  contained  traces  of

dymethylcyclohexanes and polymethylated cyclopentanes. By deliberately adding these

chemicals, we found that these impurities had no effect on our conductivity measurement.

The probable reason is that all impurity alkanes exhibit similar mobility and activation

(trap) energy for electron migration to the main component. The measurements of the

electron mobility were carried out in N2- or Ar- saturated solutions.

The conductivity setup was similar to that described in our previous publications.
48-50 Fifteen ns fwhm pulses of 248 nm photons from a Lambda Physik LPX 120i laser
were  used  to  ionize  either  neat  alkanes  or  5  µm  anthracene,  via  their  biphotonic

excitation. The neat hydrocarbon liquids were photolyzed in a cell with 4 cm optical path,

and  the  anthracene  solutions  (used  only  to  obtain  the  temperature  dependence)  were

photolyzed in a 2 cm path cell. Both cells have two planar Pt electrodes spaced by 0.65

cm  to  which  a  constant  voltage  of  4-5  kV  is  applied.  The  2  cm  cell  was  placed  in  an

aluminum  jacket;  the  temperature  of  the  sample  was  regulated  by  circulating  water

through this jacket. The entire setup was put in an aluminum box purged by dry air. The

collimated  248  nm  beam  entered  the  cell  from  one  end  through  a  3  mm  diameter

10.

aperture;  a  collinear  beam  of  532  nm  or  1064  nm  photons  from  a  Quantel  Brilliant

Nd:YAG laser (6 ns fwhm pulse with a Gaussian time profile) entered the cell from the

opposite  end  through  a  4  mm  diameter  aperture.  The  1064  nm  (or  532  nm)  beam

completely enveloped 248 nm beam inside the conductivity cell. Appropriate optics were

used to maintain the collimation and collinearity along the optical path of the two beams
inside the cell. The conductivity signal was terminated into 50 Ω, amplified by 20-30 dB

and recorded using a Tektonix DSA-601 digitizer. The time resolution was better than 2

ns. The delay time  tL  of the 1064 nm pulse relative to the 248 nm excitation pulse was

25-800  ns;  the  time  jitter  between  the  248  and  1064  nm  pulses  was  <  3  ns.  The

acquisition electronics was typically triggered by the 1064 nm pulse.

The maximum pulse energy of the 1064 nm light transmitted through the 4 mm

aperture was 190 mJ, and the maximum photon fluence J through this aperture was 1.5
J/cm2  (or  9x1018 photons/cm2).  This  large  fluence  was  needed  in  order  to  observe  the
∆κ t( ) signal due to the smallness of the parameters  τ
t  and σ for trapped electrons near
295 K (see below). The photon fluence of 248 nm light was < 0.1 J/cm2, and the typical

electron  concentration  was  5-10  nM  (in  neat  n-hexane).  The  lifetime  of  the  electron

(typically 300-500 ns) was controlled by an electron-scavenging (e.g., oxygen) impurity

(in  the  anthracene  solution,  electron  attachment  to  the  aromatic  photosensitizer  also
contributed to limit the lifetime). A typical rate constant for such a reaction is (1-2)x1011
M-1 s-1. 3 Cross recombination in the bulk and the movement to the electrodes of electrons
and  ions  were  negligible  for  t <1  µs  under  our  excitation  conditions.  Geminate

recombination  for  electron-hole  pairs  in  n-hexane and methylcyclohexane is complete

well within the duration of the 248 nm pulse (the Onsager times for these two liquids at

295 K are ca. 6 ns and ca. 50 ps for n-hexane and iso-octane, respectively).

To determine the  ∆κ t( ) signal, the 1064 nm (or 532 nm) laser was pulsed on and

off  while  the  248  nm  laser  was  pulsed  for  every  shot,  and  the  corresponding  signals
on t( )  and  κ t( ) were subtracted. A small signal (contributing < 1 % to this difference
κ
signal)  induced  by  the  action  of  the  1064  nm  laser  alone,  through  the  pickup  of  radio
frequency  noise  from  the  laser  Q-switch,  was  subtracted  from  the  ∆κ t( )  signal.

Continuous  laser  photolysis  causes  the  accumulation  of  photoactive  products  in  the

solution; care was exercised to minimize their interference by frequent replacement of the

sample.  If  not  specified  otherwise,  the  measurements  were  carried  out  at  295  K.  The
conductivity is given in units of nS/cm (= 10-7 Ω-1 m-1).

IV. RESULTS.

A typical conductivity signal from neat n-hexane following 248 nm biphotonic
laser excitation of this solvent is shown in Fig. 1 (to the left). Over the first 1 µs after the

ionization event, the electron is scavenged by an impurity in the solution. This decay is
single exponential (Fig. 2), and the conductivity signal  κ
ion   at  the  later  delay  times  is
from the secondary ions (this signal has been subtracted from κ t( ) in Figs. 1 and 2). For
5x10-4 M triethylamine in n-hexane saturated with SF6 (used to scavenge the electrons,
converting them to F-), our time-of-flight measurement yielded 9x10-4 and 6x10-4 cm2/Vs
for the mobility of the positive (triethylamine+) and negative (F-) ions, respectively. Thus,
the combined ion mobility  µ
i was ca. 1.5x10-3 cm2/Vs. Similar estimates of ion mobility

in n-hexane were reported by others (e.g., see Table 12.3 in ref. 51 and refs. 52). The

electron  signal  is  ca.  56  times  greater  than  the  signal  from  the  ions,  suggesting  that
≈0.085  cm2/Vs.  (vs.  0.082  cm2/Vs  obtained  in  ref.  37).  Direct  time-of-flight

µ
e

estimates for the electron mobility in high-purity n-hexane at 295 K are between 0.073
and 0.092 cm2/Vs. 3,37-39

Balakin et al. 20 used 694 nm (1.79 eV) light to excite trapped electrons in cold

iso-octane and some of our initial experiments with saturated hydrocarbons were carried

out using 532 nm (2.33 eV) light (Figure 1S). This turned out to be problematic since the
−  (see Sec. 1S of ref. 48). The

532 nm light excited one of the impurity anions, perhaps  O2

latter anion is known to absorb across the entire visible: the photodetachment threshold is
ca. 2 eV and the cross section near this threshold is ca. (1-10)x10-19 cm2.  53,54 Since the
−  is very slow,  54 the 532 nm photodetachment

thermal emission of the electron from  O2

results in a sudden stepwise increase in the conductivity signal; the photoinduced signal

  of  the  electron,  since  the  anion  is

generated  when  the  electron  is  scavenged  by  an  impurity  (ref.  48  and  Figure  1S).

Intentional addition of traces of oxygen increases the photoinduced signal. Due to the
strong interference from this  ∆κ t( ) signal, only 1064 nm photoexcitation can be used for

quantitative measurements.

Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate a typical  ∆κ t( ) signal induced by the absorption of

1064 nm light in room-temperature photoionized n-hexane. This signal consists of two

components: (i) a fast component whose time profile follows that of the 1064 nm laser

pulse  (corrected  by  the  response  function  of  the  systems)  and  (ii)  a  slow  component

whose  long-term  decay  kinetics  are  identical  to  those  for  the  conductivity  signal
κ

kinetics of  ∆κ t( ) is given by a sum of a Gaussian "spike" (for the fast component) and

  itself  (this  slow  signal  is  very  small  for  tL

the  same  Gaussian  convoluted  with  an  exponential  (for  the  slow  component);  at  any

delay  time  tL   of  the  1064  nm  pulse,  these  two  signals  can  be  to  separated  using  least

squares fitting, as shown in Fig. 2S, part (a). The weight of the fast component (empty

circles  in  Fig.  1),  decreases  with  increasing  delay  time  tL   in  direct  proportion  to
κ

, whereas the weight of the slow component increases in the same direction,

eventually saturating at delay times when all electrons are scavenged (see Figs. 2 and

2S(a) for n-hexane and Fig. 2S(b) for methylcyclohexane). This behavior suggests that

the slow component is due to the photodetachment from an impurity anion. Balakin and
Yakovlev  41 observed the same two components at 180-185 K and interpreted the fast

component as the signal from the electrons photodetached from intrinsic, shallow traps
and the slow component as that from extrinsic, deep traps. Since the lifetime  τ

f  of the

quasifree electron is much shorter than the duration of the pulse and all electron equilibria

settle well within 1 ns, the fast component follows the time profile of the 1064 nm pulse.

The  power  dependencies  for  the  photoinduced  signals  also  suggest  different

origins  for  these  two  components.  To  obtain  the  power  dependence  for  the  slow
component, the  ∆κ t( ) signal attained at the end of the 1064 nm laser pulse for  tL

(extrapolated from the exponential "tail" as shown in Fig. 3S(a)) was plotted against the

13.

average fluence  J  of the 1064 nm photons (see Fig. 3S(b)). Due to the reaction with an

impurity  (with  time  constant  of  ca.  270  ns),  94%  of  the  electrons  were  converted  to

expect that at saturation, the conductivity signal induced by 1064 nm light would equal

the initial signal from the electrons. The comparison of these signals suggests only 10%

of  the  anions  can  be  photoexcited  by  1064  nm  light.  Assuming  a  typical  electron
scavenging  rate  constant  of  1011-1012  M-1  cm-1, 3,55  the  concentration  of  the  impurity
which  yields  the  interfering  anion  is  just  0.4-4  µM.  It  is  impractical  (perhaps,  even

impossible) to purify alkanes to < 500 ppb to exclude this impurity.

Fortunately, such a purification is not needed because at short delay times  tL  of

the 1064 nm pulse, the weight of the signal from the anion is quite small (as very few
electrons  are  scavenged  at  these  short  delay  times)  and  the  area  ∆A   under  the  fast
component can be accurately determined (Fig. 2). To this end, the signal  ∆κ t( ) was fitted

by a weighted sum of a Gaussian curve and its integral. The area under the Gaussian was
taken as  ∆A  in eq. (4). The equilibrium conductivity signal κ

photon/cm2. The  r J  slope (that according to eq. (5) and Appendix A in the Supplement

of the electron of ca. 8.3 ps is obtained. For methylcyclohexane (in which  σ ≈3.3x10-17

cm2 for 1 µm light), 42 a similar measurement yields ca. 13 ps. We did not study other n-

alkanes, cycloalkanes and their methyl derivatives because most of these hydrocarbons

14.

exhibit  similar  electron  mobilities  and  activation  energies  to  n-hexane  and  methyl-

cyclohexane. Importantly we did not observe the 1064 nm photon induced signal (except

for the signal from impurity anions) from highly branched alkane liquids that yield high-
mobility  electrons,  such  as  iso-octane.  Apparently,  the  detrapping  time  τ

t   for  the

electrons in these liquids is too short and/or the photodetachment cross sections are too
low  to  observe  the  photoinduced  signal  at  295  K,  even  at  our  large  (  >  1  J/cm2) laser
fluence. According to Balakin et al., 20 for iso-octane at 170 K, τ

t  is ca. 20 ps.

We turn now to the temperature dependencies of the conductivity signals for n-

hexane (which has boiling and melting points at 342 K and 180 K, respectively). The data

were obtained in a relatively narrow temperature range between 280 and 320 K (Figs. 3
and  4)  since  both  the  activation  energy  for  electron  migration  57,58 and the absorption
spectrum  42  depend  on  the  temperature,  which  complicates  the  analysis  over  a  wide

temperature  range.  To  increase  the  conductivity  signal  in  a  smaller  cell,  the  electrons
were generated by photoionization of 5 µM anthracene. The anion of anthracene does not
absorb in the near infrared,  59 and the same ratio r was obtained with and without this
photosensitizer, despite the severalfold increase in the conductivity signal  κ t( )  and  its

shorter life time, due to the electron scavenging by the aromatic solute. The addition of
anthracene actually improves the accuracy of the  ∆A  measurement as it decreases, via

competitive electron scavenging, the yield of photoactive impurity anion interfering with

the  signal  (see  above).  Figures  3  and  4  show  the  Arrhenius  plots  for  the  conductivity
signal  κ

0 from the electron (extrapolated to
t → 0   using  an  exponential  fit),  the  area  ∆A   under  the  fast  component  of  the

ion  from the ions, the conductivity signal  κ

photoinduced signal at the maximum fluence of 1064 nm photons, and the ratio  r . All of

these Arrhenius plots are linear within the experimental error.

The conductivity signals κ

0 are given by the products of the ion/electron
concentration and their mobility. Both of these quantities are temperature dependent 36,50

ion  and κ

and the activation energies determined from the plots shown in Figure 3 are the sums of

the  activation  energies  for  the  photoionization  yield  Y   of  the  electrons/ions  and  the
corresponding mobilities.  50  For the mobilities  µ±   of  molecular  ions  in n-hexane (see

15.

Fig. 4S for the literature data), the activation energies are 8.2±0.2 kJ/mol (for anions) and
11.3±0.1 kJ/mol (for cations). The activation energy for the sum  µ

i of the ion mobilities

is  9.4±0.2  kJ/mol.  Given  that  the  activation  energy  for  κ

ion   is  18.2±0.8  kJ/mol,  the

activation  energy  for  the  ion  (and,  therefore,  electron)  yield  Y   is  ca.  8.8±1.0  kJ/mol.

Similar estimates of 5.5±1 and 10±1 kJ/mol were obtained for the activation energy of bi-

248  nm  photon  ionization  of  triphenylene  in  methylcyclohexane  and  cyclohexane,
respectively. 50 Subtracting this activation energy from 32.6±0.4 kJ/mol obtained for κ
e ,

the  activation  energy  for  µ

e

  is  23.8±1.4  kJ/mol  (ca.  230  meV),  which  compares

favorably with the time-of-flight estimate of 190 37,39 to 230 meV. 4

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) exhibit the temperature dependencies for the area  ∆A  and
r J=

ratio  r, respectively. This ratio, which is proportional to the detrapping time  τ

,

t

obviously does not dependent on the photoionization yield (eq. (5)). The corresponding
activation energy is 21±0.4 kJ/mol (ca. 200 meV). The activation energy for  ∆A  is ca.
2.7±0.5 kJ/mol, and the activation energy for the product  µ τ

f  (which is proportional to
∆A Y , eq. (4)) is just -(6±2) kJ/mol. Another estimate for this energy (from the identity

) gives an estimate of -(4±2) kJ/mol. It appears that the activation energy is

nearly zero and  µ τ

T∝ . Weak temperature dependencies for the mobility  µ

f  and the
f   of  quasifree  electron  is  one  of  the  tenets  of  the  two-state  model.  1  Our

lifetime  τ

experiment validates these assumptions and supports the prevalent view that the steep
temperature dependence for  µ

 originates through the phonon-assisted emission from

e

traps. Note that in our estimates, it was assumed that the cross section for the electron

detachment  by  1064  nm  photons  does  not  change  substantially  over  the  narrow

temperature range.

IV. DISCUSSION

We  conclude  that  in  room-temperature  hydrocarbon  liquids  exhibiting  low

electron mobility  µ

 (ca. 0.1 cm2/Vs), the mean residence time  τ

e

t  of electrons in traps

is shorter than 8-13 ps  and the activation energy of detrapping (which should be close to

16.

the binding energy  Et  of the traps) is ca. 200 meV. Both of these estimates are close to
those obtained by Mozumder 22,29 using the "quasiballistic" model for electron transport.
As emphasized in Sec. II, the experimentally determined  τ

t  actually provides an upper

bound estimate for the detrapping time. As seen from our results, this upper bound is ca.
≈ 310±100  fs  lifetime  for  the
200  times  smaller  than  the  estimate  obtained  when  τ

f

quasifree electron (estimated by Knoesel et al.) 36 is substituted into the two-state model.
The lifetime-mobility product  µ τ
f   for  the  quasifree  electron  (where  the  apparent  µ
might be reduced due to the incomplete velocity relaxation) 22,29 is ca. 10-12 cm2/V and its
≈ 40 Å, which is well within the Onsager radius of 300

Å. Assuming that  µ

≈20-50 cm2/Vs (as suggested by electron Hall mobility 15,23 and  e+

f

Doppler  effect  mobility  measurements),  26  we  obtain  τ

≈ 20-50  fs.  Again,  this  is

f

perfectly  consistent  with  the  estimate  of  ca.  30  fs  obtained  by  Mozumder  29 using the

"quasiballistic"  model.  On  the  other  hand,  our  estimate  is  more  than  an  order  of
magnitude  lower  than  the  damping  time  τ

d   obtained  from  the  THz  spectrum  of
(quasifree?) electron in n-hexane.  35,36 The electron density in our study was as low or
even lower than that in the THz study of Knoesel et al., 35,36 and the shortening of τ

f  due

to electron-electron scattering cannot be the reason for this discrepancy.

Before considering how to resolve this apparent contradiction, we re-examine the

basic assumptions made in our analysis. In particular, the properties of trapped electrons
in  nonpolar  liquids  are  not  well  understood.  1  For  example,  it  has  not  yet  been

conclusively demonstrated that the electrons in shallow traps (which are involved in the

conduction equilibria) are the same electrons which contribute to the absorption in the

near and mid infrared. The arguments given below suggest that they are the same. We

argue that the entire absorption band of the electrons in liquid hydrocarbons originates

from a bound-to-continuum transition from an electron "bubble" to the conduction band.

A. Absorption spectra and photodetachment cross sections.

Any  further  discussion  requires  a  concrete  model  for  the  trapped  electron  in  a

nonpolar  liquid.  The  simplest  of  such  models  is  that  of  an  electron  trapped  in  a

17.

rectangular spherical potential well of depth  U  and a hard core radius  a. The electron
  9  with  a  binding  energy

would  localize  in  such  a  well  provided  that  U

.  This  model,  also  known  as  the  Wigner-Seiz  model,  9,43,44,60 or the

electron bubble model, 16,45-47 was originally suggested for electrons in liquid 4He. Since
≈1 eV (due to the negligible polarizability of He atoms) and  a ≈ 17-20

for this liquid  V0
Å (due to the low surface tension),  16,47 the well is deep, supporting several bound-to-
bound (bb) transitions (1s-1p 61,62 and 1s-2p) 45,61 in addition to bound-to-continuum (bc)
transitions  63 from  the  ground  1s  state.  The  bubble  model  accurately  describes  the
pressure and temperature dependencies for the corresponding transition energies 45,47,61-63

and accounts for many other phenomena, such as the explosion of the electron bubbles in
the acoustic field,  47,64 emission of the electrons from the bubbles across the surface, 17
sound wave generation, 65 vortex trapping, 66 etc.

This  remarkable  success  prompted  several  workers  9,43,44,71  to  use  the  bubble
model for electrons in low-temperature, vitreous hydrocarbons which, like liquid  4He,

also exhibit large positive  V0 . According to these models, the entire absorption spectrum

for such electrons originates through a bc transition from the ground 1s state. Metastable

trapped  electrons  in  glassy  hydrocarbons  can  be  observed  using  magnetic  resonance
techniques,  such  as  EPR  67  and  ESEEM.  68  According  to  these  data,  the  1s  electron
resides at the center of a spherical cavity with a radius  a of 3.4-3.6 Å. 67,68 This cavity is

lined  by  CH3  groups  of  the  alkane  molecules.  The  electron  is  weakly  coupled  (via
magnetic  dipole  interaction)  with  ca.  20  methyl  protons.  68  The  preference  for  methyl

protons is due to the higher polarizability of the C-H bonds in comparison to the C-C
bonds.  69  To  a  first  approximation,  the  depth  U   of  the  potential  well  is  given  by

 is the Born polarization energy for a sphere

of radius  a. 9,43,60 Since  V0 's are large (0.6-1 eV), 70 the potential well is deep, and bound-

to-bound (bb) transitions are possible. Consequently, there are two schools of thought

concerning the electron spectra in the vitreous hydrocarbons: (i) that the entire spectrum
is due to the bc transitions, 9,43,44,71 and (ii) that the bc transitions dominate only above a
certain threshold energy  Ebc (ca. 1 eV);  10,72-74  below  this  energy,  both  the  bc  and  bb

18.

transitions  may  occur.  The  latter  situation  occurs  for  solvated  electrons  in  the  polar
media, where the potential wells are deep. 8,10

free p-wave electron, 75 the cross section for  E Et

 is given by σ

. This

result does not depend on the exact form of the potential provided that it decreases faster
than  r −1  towards  the  bulk.  McGrane  and  Lipsky  44  recently  obtained  the  spectra  of

trapped electrons in glassy alkanes in the near and mid infrared and examined the low-

energy "tail". Wigner's relation holds exactly, suggesting that the low-energy slope and,

therefore, the entire spectrum of the trapped electron is due to the bc  transitions.  The

analysis of these spectra using the spherical well model yields very similar estimates for
the cavity radii a as those obtained using magnetic resonance spectroscopies. 67,68

Following the photoexcitation, the electrons are promoted to the conduction band

and for a brief time they become mobile, generating photocurrent and recombining with

their parent cations. This recombination results in the bleaching of the trapped electron

absorbance (and the decrease in its EPR signal) and also the luminescence. The argument
has been given in the past 10 that the absorption spectrum cannot be entirely due to the bc

transitions  since  the  action  spectra  of  photocurrent,  photobleaching,  and

photoluminescence, at least for some vitreous hydrocarbons, are blue-shifted with respect

to their absorption spectra. When the ratio of the corresponding cross sections is plotted
against the photon energy  E , it appears that the quantum yield  φ

t  of photodetrapping is a
 to the blue of the absorption maximum. 72,74,76 The

sigmoid function centered at  E Ebc

  suggests  that  φ

≈ 1.  72  The  surprising  aspect  of  these

t

measurements  is  that  the  action  spectra  produced  by  different  methods  (absorption
bleaching, 77,78 EPR, 79 conductivity, 72,74,76 and luminescence 77) are not the same. 10 The

similarity  between  the  action  spectra  and  absorption  spectra  was  observed  for  some
vitreous  hydrocarbons  (e.g.,  methylcyclohexane)  71  but  not  for  others  (e.g.,  3-
methylpentane). 72 The important point missing from the debates is that the detrapping

per  se  does  not  generate  any  photocurrent  since  the  conduction  band  electron  has  to

escape the field of its parent cation first; that may require extra energy. Conversely, in

19.

order to recombine, this electron has to avoid being captured by its parent trap (whose

relaxation is slow in the low-temperature solid), which also requires extra energy. Thus,

the  blue  shift  cannot  be  considered  as  a  clear-cut  evidence  for  the  occurrence  of  a  bb

transition.

Given the success of the electron bubble model for solid hydrocarbons, it seems

surprising that it has not been used to account for the properties of trapped electrons in

liquid hydrocarbons.  There  are  good  reasons  to  believe  that  the  latter  species  are  also
localized  in  voids.  The  experiments  of  Holroyd  and  co-workers  11,80  on  the  pressure
dependence of  µ

 yield the volume change associated with electron trapping (see Sec.

e

6.2  of  ref.  1).  This  quantity  can  be  divided  into  a  positive  term  corresponding  to  the
cavity volume ( ∝ a3 ) and a negative term ( ∝ −a 1) due to the electrostriction. This allows
estimation  of  the  cavity  volume,  which  gives  a ≈ 3.2-3.6 Å,  1,11  close  to  the  estimates
obtained from the absorption spectra  44,60 and magnetic resonance data  67,68 in vitreous

hydrocarbons. Molecular dynamics and path integral calculations for electrons in liquid
ethane 81,82 and amorphous polyethylene 19,82 also predict that electrons reside in cavities

of 5-7 Å in diameter.

The skepticism towards the validity of the bubble model for liquid hydrocarbons
can  be  traced  to  Hammer  et  al.,  83  where  the  stability  of  the  electron  bubbles  was

it is not fulfilled in the room temperature liquid alkanes for which  V0   is  close  to  zero
(e.g., for n-hexane  V0  is ca. 100 meV at 295 K). 1,2,4,5  Hammer et al. 83 observed that the
way to obtain the stable electron bubble is to assume that the local dielectric constant  ε is
50%  higher  than  the  average  value  of  ε ≈ 2  in  the  bulk.  That  the  Born  formula

incorrectly  estimates  the  polarization  energy  due  to  the  neglect  of  the  C-H  bond

polarization is a recurrent theme of many models of trapped electrons in vitreous alkanes
(e.g., ref. 44). In the "microdipole" model of Kevan and co-workers, 69,84 the electron is

20.

stabilized via its interaction with the dipoles induced by the polarization of C-H bonds in

methyl groups lining the solvation cavity. In this model, the self-consistency may only be

achieved  if  one  postulates  for  this  C-H  bond  ca.  5  times  greater  polarizability  than
commonly assumed. It has been suggested 85 that the missing energy term might be the

exchange interaction between the cavity electron and the valence electrons in the alkane

molecules, which is neglected in the one-electron models. The need for such a term is

clear from Fig. 5S(a), where the radial electron density for the ground state electron for
=180  meV  is  plotted.  The  wavefunction  extends  well  beyond  the  well  radius  to

Et

a≈ 2 . Such a diffuse electron density is peculiar only to solvated electrons in shallow

r

traps. As there is considerable density in the region filled with the solvent molecules, a

consistent  microscopic  theory  should  prescribe  how  the  molecules  interact  with  these

molecules  outside  the  void  that  makes  the  core  of  the  electron  bubble.  Our  density
functional  calculations  48  suggested  that  penetration  of  the  electron  density  onto  the

methyl groups would indeed increase the polarizability of the C-H bonds in the manner
suggested by Kevan et al. 69 consistently with the geometry suggested by their magnetic
resonance data. 26,67 Although the bubble model obviously "works" in terms of predicting

the  optical  spectra  and  the  resulting  parameters  are  consistent  between  various

measurements,  this  model  does  not  specify  through  which  interactions  the  trapping

potential U  originates (in other words, how the electron interacts with the bubble "wall")

and what makes the cavity stable. Such are the limitations of this simple model.

What  interests  us  most  in  relation  to  this  study  is  whether  the  electron  bubble
model may account for the absorption spectra in liquid alkanes. Atherton et al. 42 obtained

a series of such spectra for methylcyclohexane between 132 and 295 K (the melting point

is 147 K). To our knowledge, these are the only data in the literature that are taken across

a sufficiently wide range of wavelengths and temperatures. In Figure 5, the normalized
spectra  obtained  by  Atherton  et  al.  42  are  fitted  using  the  electron  bubble  model  9,44

assuming, following the previous discussion, that the bubble radii  a are not temperature
dependent (we assumed  a ≈ 3.4 Å from the estimated cavity volume of 96±18 cm2/mol 1

at 295 K) and varying the binding energy  Et  only. As seen from this figure, the model

reproduces the spectral profiles quite well. The blue shift is due to the systematic increase

21.

in  Et  (and the well depth  U ) with the decreasing temperatures (Figs. 5(b) and 5(c)) The

increase in  Et  is from 180 meV at 295 K to 345 meV at 132 K (the increase in U  is from
1.44 to 1.74 eV). The calculated molar absorptivity of the electron is 7x103 M-1 cm-1 (Fig.
5(a)) vs. the experimental estimate of 8.7x103 M-1 cm-1 for methylcyclohexane-d14 at 295
K.  42

The increase in the U  with the decreasing temperature is easy to rationalize, as  V0

rapidly increases in denser medium, whereas the polarization energy changes much less

(this trend continues in solid methylcyclohexane, as suggested by the data of McGrane
and Lipsky  44 for 77 K shown in Fig. 5(c)). The increase in  V0 , as shown elsewhere, 86
can be rationalized using the model of Springett, Jortner, and Rice 46 in its formulation by
Kevan et al. 87 This is illustrated in Fig. 5(c)  using the experimental data for n-hexane 86

and calculated  V0  energies for methylcyclohexane. Following the decrease in  Et  with the
increasing  temperature,  the  activation  energy  for  µ

  should  also  decrease.  The  only

e

data for the electron mobility across a temperature interval of comparable width to that
explored by Atherton et al. 42 are for 3-methylpentane.  57 As the temperature decreases
below 200 K, the electron mobility becomes lower than 10-10 cm2/Vs and the activation
energy increases from 140 meV to 400 meV.  37 In very cold 3-methylpentane (100-160
K), the trapped electron can be observed using optically-detected EPR, 88 via its magnetic
resonance  line.  89  The  width  of  this  line  depends  on  the  rate  of  the  spectral  diffusion

which,  in  turn,  depends  on  the  rate  with  which  the  electron  samples  different

configurations of C-H protons, by trap-to-trap hopping or repeated thermal emission and
trapping. 88,89 From the linewidth analysis, it is possible to estimate the activation energy
of the spectral diffusion, which also turns out to be close to 400 meV. 88 Thus, the trends

observed  in  Fig.  5(c)  are  paralleled  by  the  trends  observed  in  the  electron  mobility,

linking the electron bubble and the two-state models together. As argued in Appendix B,

this conclusion still holds if one assumes realistic variation in the binding energies of
electron traps, as suggested by several authors. 28,31-33

In the bubble model, the quantum yield for electron photodetachment is unity. As

mentioned above, there is some controversy concerning whether this yield is always unity

22.

across  the  entire  absorption  spectrum  in  glassy  hydrocarbons.  For  electrons  in  liquid

alkanes, bb transitions are unlikely given the smallness of the binding energies deduced

from  Figure  5:  there  are  no  other  bound  states  apart  from  the  ground  1s  state.
Furthermore, for methylcyclohexane, the quantum yield is constant ( ≈ 1) 71  across  the

entire absorption band of the electron even in a 77 K glass, and we are confident that this
would  be  even  more  so  in  the  liquid.  Our  estimates  for  τ

t   for  n -hexane  and

methylcyclohexane are very similar, which suggests that this is also true for the former

liquid. The calculations suggest that the absorption (photodetachment) cross section at

1060 nm should increase ca. 2 times as compared to 295 K (assuming the same trend for

Et   as  in  methylcyclohexane  and  n -hexane;  see  Fig.  5S(b)),  i.e.,  from  the  data  of
Yakovlev  and  co-workers  6,41  it  appears  that  at  180-185  K,  τ

t   is  ca.  420  ps  for

methylcyclohexane and ca. 200 ps for n-hexane (vs. ca. 13 ps and 8.3 ps, respectively, at

295  K).  Our  estimates  for  Et   at  191  K  and  295  K  are  250  meV  and  180  meV,

respectively.  Thus,  the  detrapping  rate  rapidly  decreases  with  the  increasing  binding

energy, in agreement with the two-state model.

We conclude that (i) the same electrons that contribute to the optical absorption

spectrum are also involved in the equilibria which are responsible for electron conduction

and  (ii)  the  electron  bubble  model,  despite  its  conceptual  faults,  provides  a  consistent

description of trapped electrons in these solvents.

B. Localization, trapping, and the two-state model.

The considerations above suggest that our estimates for the mean residence time

of the electrons in shallow traps should be reliable, at least within an order of magnitude,

and  various  complications  discussed  in  Sec.  V.A  do  not  change  this  conclusion.  The

absorption spectra of the electrons in liquid alkanes are consistent with a bc transition to

the  conduction  band,  and  these  spectra  can  be  modeled  quite  well  using  the  simple

spherical  well  model  with  the  parameters  consistent  between  various  independent

measurements. The binding energies obtained from the spectral analysis are similar to the

activation  energies  of  electron  and  electron  detrapping.  All  of  these  quantities  are

temperature  dependent.  Our  estimates  appear  to  be  in  good  agreement  with  those

23.

typically  assumed  in  the  two-state  model  (particularly,  its  recent  formulation  by
Mozumder), 21,22,29,30 and may be regarded as further validation of this model.

On  the  other  hand,  as  stated  above,  there  appears  to  be  no  reasonable  way  to
t   and  the  estimates  of  Knoesel  et  al.  36 for  τ

accommodate  both  our  estimates  for  τ

f

within the same two-state model postulating a thermal equilibrium between the localized
≈ 310±100  fs  36
and extended states. There are other problems with the estimate of  τ

f

(Sec.  I)  as  it  yields  improbably  high  mobility  and  exceedingly  long  free  path  for  the

quasifree electron. Yet this estimate is not wholly without a precedent:

Using  femtosecond  angle-resolved  2-photon  photoemission  (PE)  spectroscopy,
Ge et al. 90,91 recently studied the localization of n=1 surface-state electrons on thin layers

of  n -heptane  covering  Ag(111)  at  120  K.  The  electrons  are  localized  in  the  image
potential  well,  in  the  direction  normal  to  the  surface;  91  still,  such  electrons  may  be

delocalized in the transverse direction (in a similar fashion to the electrons on the surface
of liquid  4He).  17,92 The parabolic band of the free electrons with  m

 has been

*
e

e

observed in the PE spectra. The lifetimes for these delocalized electrons range from 800

fs to 200 fs, depending on the in-plane component  k||  of the wave vector (that changed
from  0  to  0.23  Å-1,  respectively).  90  This  time  scale  is  similar  to  the  estimate  of  the
electron scattering time by Knoesel et al. 36 On the other hand, the energetics of electron

localization on the surface is much different from that in the bulk liquid: e.g., according
to Ge et al.,  90,91 the localized state (a small polaron) has an energy just 10 meV lower

than the bottom of the conduction band.

A  relatively  slow  rate  of  electron  trapping  would  also  be  consistent  with

theoretical modeling. The theorists have long striven to simulate the electrons in nonpolar
dielectric liquids (mainly, helium  93-100 and rare gases, 97,100-103 and small hydrocarbons,
such as methane and ethane) 81,82 and disordered solids (such as amorphous polyethylene)
18,19,82,104,105 using density functional theories, 94,95,102 path integral Monte-Carlo methods,
81,96,97,101 RISM-polaron theories, 94,101-103 mixed quantum chemical - molecular dynamics
(QM/MD)  calculations,  18,19,81,96,99,100  and,  most  recently,  ab  initio 104,105  and  Car-
Parrinello calculations. 105 These theories suggest a cavity electron as the lowest state for

electron  in  helium,  106  ethane  81,82  and  polyethylene  19,82  and  delocalized,  quasifree
electron  in  Ar,  Xe,  and  methane.  81,82,106  However,  with  the  exception  of  QM/MD,
19,82,96,97  these  methods  are  unsuitable  to  study  the  dynamics  of  electron  localization
and/or detrapping. Only recently did the theory start to address such issues. 82,93 Several

important clues were obtained:

For  electron  in  dense  liquid  4He,  Space  and  Coker  93  observed  that  the

localization/trapping are bimodal. The fast process takes just 50-100 fs, over which the

electron is localized in a nodeless state; this rapid localization is followed by a slower

relaxation  that  takes  200-700  fs,  in  which  a  solvation  cavity  (the  electron  bubble)

gradually  emerged.  During  this  relaxation,  the  electron  rapidly  hopped  between  the

adjacent density fluctuations (the proto-cavities), in contradiction to the premises of the

two-state model. The relatively long time scale for electron trapping in liquid helium is
supported by experiments of Silver and co-workers 107 yielded an estimate of 300 fs for
the electron trapping time at 1.4 K (there are authors suggesting even longer times). 108
The model of Rosenblit and Jortner 65 gives ca. 8-10 ps expansion times for the spherical

cavity during its thermalization. Thus, the time scale for electron trapping appears to be

nearly as long or even longer than the time for the solvation of electrons in water (250-
300 fs)  109 and ammonia (200±50).  110 For amorphous polyethylene, the calculations of
Cubero and Quirke  19  suggest that the trapping (as opposed to the initial localization)

takes picoseconds. The same calculation indicates that detrapping is relatively fast (tens
≈350 meV), 19,82 as the detrapping is

of picoseconds) even for relatively deep traps ( Et

driven by a large increase in the entropy.  19 These estimates are similar to ours for n-

hexane  and  methylcyclohexane  at  295  K  (Sec.  IV)  as  well  as  those  of  Balakin  and
Yakovlev for these two hydrocarbons at 180-185 K. 41

The  QM/MD  calculations  indicate  that  the  two-state  model  is  fundamentally

flawed,  as  it  makes  no  distinction  between  electron  localization  and  the  subsequent

trapping. The latter involves the reorganization of solvent molecules around the excess

electron. Such a process takes considerably longer time than the initial localization (that
occurs in a few tens of femtoseconds, that is, a few C-H vibration cycles).  22,29  While

modifications  of  the  two-state  model  to  implement  such  a  distinction  between  the

25.

localization and relaxation/trapping are possible (see, for example, Sakai et al.) 111 many

simplifying ad hoc assumptions have to be made, without much justification. The two-

state models of electron transport are successful only so far as the exact description of the

localization/trapping  process  is  not  necessary.  This  is  typically  the  case  in  the
conductivity  studies  since  the  variation  in  µ

  as  a  function  of  the  solvent  structure,

e

temperature, etc. is mainly determined by the rate of thermal emission from traps rather

than the intricate details of localization and trapping. Another reason for the success of

these models is that the intermediate states of the trapping process seem to contribute

little to the overall electron conduction.

C. Reinterpretation of terahertz spectra.

While the two-state model may be deficient in more than one way, we believe that

the apparent conflict of this model and the properties of quasifree electron obtained from
the THz experiments of Knoesel et al. 36 has another explanation. Basically, no proof has

been provided that the observed THz signal is indeed from the quasifree electron. Rather,

the experiments suggest that (i) the THz radiation is absorbed by a Drude oscillator and

(ii) the concentration of these Drude oscillators correlates with the overall yield of the

excess electrons in a hydrocarbon. Thus, any electron species that behaves like a Drude
≈310±100  fs  would  fit  the  observations.  A  circular
oscillator  with  a  damping  time  τ

d

argument was then given by Knoesel et al.: 35,36 a Drude oscillator with an effective mass
≈ me  would  exhibit  a  drift  mobility  >  10  cm2/Vs;  this  large  mobility  points  to  the

quasifree electron; this identification justifies the estimate for the oscillator's mass. The

problem  with  this  argument  is  that  the  electron  bubble  may  also  be  considered  as  a

massive  Drude  oscillator.  There  is  a  well-known  precedent  for  such  a  treatment:  The

absorption of GHz radiation by damped oscillations of electron bubbles trapped in the

clamping electric field under the surface of liquid He has been observed as early as 1972

(see  Sec.  IV.A  of  ref.  17).  The  widths  of  the  resonance  lines  perfectly  agree  with  the

predictions  of  the  Drude  model  for  a  massive  oscillator.  For  an  electron  bubble,  the
reduced mass  M  is  1 2 of the mass of displaced liquid; 17,28 for n-hexane this would be
ca.  30-100  a.m.u.  The  mobility  µ

t   of  such  an  oscillator  is  given  by  µ τ

Substituting  τ

reasonable  estimate  for  trapped-electron  mobility.  28  Similar  estimates  were  obtained

using a semihydrodynamic theory for the electron bubble migration (see eqs. (4) and (5)
)

in  ref.  79).  This  theory  suggests  that  the  damping  time  τ

would be independent of the viscosity of the liquid (in this equation  n  is the average

number  density).  Since  at  any  time  most  of  the  excess  electrons  in  alkane  liquids  are

trapped  as  electron  bubbles,  the  THz  signal  from  such  trapped  electrons  can  easily

swamp the signal from the quasifree electrons, whose equilibrium fraction in n-hexane is
only 3x10-3 at 295 K. It looks probable that the THz signal observed by Knoesel et al.
35,36 is from the electron bubbles rather than a free carrier plasma.

Furthermore, as seen from Fig. 7 in ref. 36, the Drude oscillator model provided a
rather poor fit at the lower end of the observation range, for frequencies  ω π2  of 0.4-0.6

THz. Such deviations may originate from the effect of bubble vibrations on its oscillation

in the electric field since the resonance frequencies of these vibrations fall right into this
sub-THz range. Gross and Tung-Li 112 and Celli et al.  113 gave detailed analyses of the

vibrational modes for the electron bubbles in liquid helium; their theories can be readily
adapted  to  other  liquids.  Using  the  expression  for  the  frequency  ω

( l = 0) mode of the bubble obtained by Gross and Tung-Li,  112  ω

the surface tension in n-hexane, 83 one obtains an estimate of  ω π

the Rayleigh formula for gas bubbles) and assuming the bulk value of  γ = 2x10-2 J/m2 for
0 2 ≈ 0.1-0.2 THz. The
frequencies of  l = 2 and  l = 3 modes are ca. 1.4 and 7 times higher, respectively. 112  If, as
suggested here, Knoesel et al.  35,36 have observed the effect of bubble vibrations on the

THz conductivity, their experiment would be the first demonstration of such vibrations in

any liquid, fulfilling the theoretical predictions made almost four decades ago!

Interestingly, Knoesel et al. 114 did not observe an increase in the electron signal

when  (trapped)  electrons  were  photoexcited  by  a  short  800  nm  laser  pulse  and

photogenerated  "quasifree  electrons"  probed  by  a  coincident  THz  pulse,  though  under

their excitation conditions a 2-fold increase in the THz signal might have been expected.

This observation argues against the long trapping times for the quasifree electrons. Since

27.

the  cycle  of  the  THz  wave  was  ca.  2  ps  ( >> τ

d ),  it  is  possible  that  the  free  electrons

decayed before detection. However, the simplest way to interpret this result is to assume,

following  the  suggestion  made  above,  that  the  localization  of  quasifree  electrons  was

rapid  (20-50  fs)  and  the  THz  signal  originated  from  the  oscillations  of  (thermalized)

electron bubbles instead.

V. CONCLUSION.

Photoexcitation of trapped electrons in liquid n-hexane and methylcyclohexane at

280-320 K has been studied (Sec. IV). The absorption of 1064 nm light promotes the

electron from the trap (the electron bubble) back into the conduction band of the liquid,

increasing the conductivity by many orders of magnitude before the photogenerated free

electron  is  localized  and  trapped.  From  the  analysis  of  the  data  (loosely  based  on  the
approach of Yakovlev and co-workers  6,20,41 further developed in this study), the mean
residence time τ

t  of the electrons in traps has been estimated to be ca. 8.3 ps for n-hexane

and ca. 13 ps for methylcyclohexane (at 295 K). The rate of detrapping decreases with

decreasing temperature with an activation energy of ca. 200 meV (280-320 K), whereas
the  lifetime-mobility  product  µ τ

f   for  quasifree  electrons  scales  linearly  with

f

temperature  in  the  specified  range.  The  estimated  localization  time  of  the  quasifree

electron  is  20-50  fs  and  its  mean  path  is  ca.  40  Å.  Our  estimates  for  the  electron

localization and detrapping times are in good agreement with the "quasiballistic" model
of Mozumder. 21,22,29,30

On the other hand, this localization time is significantly shorter than ca. 310±100

fs  obtained  for  the  scattering  time  of  the  free  electron  plasma  in  room-temperature n-
hexane and cyclohexane using time-domain THz spectroscopy. 35,36 This conflict goes to

the very foundations of the electron transport theories for nonpolar liquids, as it cannot be

resolved  within  the  standard  (thermal  equilibrium)  two-state  model.  We  suggest,

however,  that  there  is,  actually,  no  such  conflict:  The  THz  signal  originates  from  the

oscillations  of  the  electron  bubbles  in  the  THz  electric  field  rather  than  from  the

dynamics of the free-electron plasma. Vibrations of these bubbles may be responsible for

the deviations from the Drude behavior observed for frequencies below 0.4 THz (Sec.

28.

V.C).  Other  known  properties  of  trapped  electrons  in  liquid  hydrocarbons  can  also  be

consistently accounted for using the electron bubble model (Sec. V.A).

While  both  this  bubble  model  and,  more  generally,  the  equilibrium  two-state

model are obviously incomplete (Sec. V.B), it is remarkable how well these two models

can rationalize various properties of electrons in hydrocarbon liquids, in a consistent way.

This  suggests  that  more  advanced  microscopic  models  of  electron  transport  that  are

presently  being  developed  should  retain  several  crucial  features  of  these  models.

Specifically,  the  trapped  electron,  regardless  of  the  exact  manner  in  which  it  interacts

with the molecules lining the solvation cavity (electron exchange, polarization of C-H

bonds, etc.), should behave more-or-less like a particle in a box (that is, a deformable,

aspherical, vibrating cavity) of ca. 7 Å in diameter, with a binding energy of 180-200

meV (at 295 K). This energy should increase with the liquid density and decrease with

the temperature, following the same trend as  V0 . The electron localization and trapping,

regardless  of  how  these  two  processes  exactly  proceed,  should  be  such  that  the  free

electron loses the momentum in a few tens of femtoseconds and the trapping is fully over

in a picosecond. There should be a dynamic equilibrium between the trapped and the free

electrons; the characteristic time for the thermal emission of the trapped electron should

be tens of picoseconds. Any theory that yields these patterns would automatically provide

the  features  that  make  the  electron  bubble  and  two-state  models  so  remarkably

successful.

Appendix A. Derivation of basic formulas.

We first consider interconversion between two species, electron-1 and electron-2,

2→
0 be their equilibrium concentrations and  k12  and  k21 be the rate constants for 1
1→  reactions, respectively. The equilibrium constant is given by  K k

In eq. (A2), it has been assumed that the photoexcitation of electron-2 yields the final
state ("hot" electron) that very rapidly converts to electron-1. We will also assume that
the lifetime-mobility product of this state is much smaller than this product for electron-1.
We  first  examine  the  case  when  the  irradiance  is  sufficiently  small  and  the  change
∆e t

A similar approach can be used to obtain the general result for multiple electron

trapped electrons. While this formula is intuitively obvious, the derivation is lengthy and
cumbersome. Furthermore, it is easy to see that this formula is correct only for small laser
fluences. When the fluence is large, the equilibria between the electrons in different traps
can be shifted during the pulse and a phenomenon similar to saturation manifests itself.
This phenomenon has been observed experimentally, [40] when polar molecules were
added to n-hexane, to create new kinds of electron traps in the solution.

Let  e f   be  the  concentration  of  quasifree  electrons  which  are  in  the  state  of
equilibrium with several electron traps; the concentration of electrons in these traps is
denoted by  em:

Eq.  (A30)  was  obtained  for  a  system  in  which  the  electrons  in  different  traps
equilibrate via the thermal emission and subsequent trapping. The formula can be further
generalized if other ways exist for electrons to equilibrate between the traps, by changing
the definition of the residence time for the electron in a given trap. Consider equilibrium
reactions (A15), with forward and backward rate constants  kn m→  and  km n→  for transfer of
electrons between the corresponding traps (in addition to reactions (A9)) that does not
involve thermally assisted electron detachment. It is easy to demonstrate that in such a

We conclude that eq. (A30) is very general; it applies to any system, regardless of
how the equilibria between the electrons residing in different traps are settled. All that is
required for this formula to be correct is that the excitation pulse is sufficiently weak.

It is noteworthy that the response function  g t( )of the conductivity setup does not

have to be very fast to obtain the integral

obvious, consideration is that the background conductivity signal from the cations (holes)
and anions (generated via electron scavenging) does not appear in any expression for  ∆A
provided that these species are not photoexcited by the laser pulse, as their concentration
and the corresponding contribution to the conductivity signal do not change. The latter
requires  that  the  electron  concentration  is  low  and  the  second-order  recombination  of
cations with quasifree electrons during the photoexcitation pulse can be neglected.

Appendix B. One trap vs. many traps.

In section IV.A, we assumed that the electron trap is well defined. On the other
hand, there are "two-state" theories (see, for example, refs. 28 and 31) which postulate a
distribution

of  ca.  120  meV  at  295  K,  where  Cv   is  the  heat  capacity  of  the  medium.  [31]  This
dispersion is comparable with the average binding energy  Et
 of the trapped electron
(Sec. V.A). The authors [28,31,32,33] did not justify their estimates for δEt and provided
only general arguments in favor of the distribution given by eq. (B1). It would be more
appropriate, in the spirit of the fluctuation model invoked by Schiller and co-workers,
[28,31] to consider the fluctuations of the binding potential  U  (instead of  Et ), and use
eq.  (B2)  to  estimate  the  dispersion  δU   of  the  well  depths.  The  latter  could  indeed  be
several tens of meV provided that the fluctuations of  U  are mainly due to the thermal
vibrations  (breathing  modes)  of  the  electron  bubble.  Such  estimates  can  be  readily
obtained using the approach used by Parshin and Perverzev [62b] to estimate the width of
the 1s-1p absorption band for electron bubbles in liquid 4He. Importantly, the dispersion
of trap energies is significant for liquid alkanes only. For vitreous alkanes at 77 K,  kT Cv
is ca. 10 meV,  δU

Lipsky [44] supports this conclusion: The smearing of the binding energy (which, in the
bubble model, equals the threshold energy  Et  of the absorption band) over more than a
few meV would have destroyed the Wigner relation for the absorption cross-section (Sec.
V.A) which, experimentally, holds for  E Et

fluctuation and band tail models suggest considerable variation of binding energies at 295
K.

Our simulations, in which the absorption spectra of trapped electrons calculated

using the bubble model for a fixed radius a were weighted by the two distributions  p Et

model with a single trap and the model with multiple traps from the absorption spectra
alone. The only spectral region which is sensitive to the distribution is the red edge (6-8
µm) which has not yet been explored. The same calculation suggests that the dispersion
of the absorption cross sections around 1 µm (to the blue from the absorption maximum)
does not exceed the average cross section, i.e., our estimate of  τ στ σ
 should be
of the same order of magnitude as  τ

Time-dependent d.c. photoconductivity signals from neat methylcyclohexane at 295 K
(the signals are weaker than in other figures shown in this paper since a short-path 2 cm
conductivity cell has been used to obtain the traces). The liquid is ionized at  t = 0 by two
photons from a 248 nm laser and then the "trapped electrons" (in fact, impurity anions)
=  (6 ns fwhm, 0.5 J/cm2). The
are photoexcited by a delayed 532 nm laser pulse at  t
delay time  tL  is 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 µs, respectively. The signal κ t( ) obtained in the
absence of the 532 nm photoexcitation is plotted to the left; the 532 nm photon induced
signal  ∆κ is plotted to the right. The decay kinetics of both signals are identical and the
amplitude of the  ∆κ increases with the delay time of the 532 nm pulse in the same way
κ decreases as the electron is scavenged by impurity. This behavior indicates that the
532 nm signal is due to the electron photodetachment from an impurity anion generated
when the impurity reacts with the electron in methylcyclohexane.

(a) The same data for n-hexane as in Fig. 2 in the text plotted on the logarithmic time
scale. The  ∆κ traces (scattered dots; to the right) were fit by a sum of a Gaussian (for the
electron spike) and a Gaussian convoluted with an exponential (for the slow component
due to the electron photodetachment from an impurity anion). The time constant of this
exponential  component  is  the  same  as  that  for  the  κ
  trace  (to  the  left).  The
weights of the fast component (the "spike") are juxtaposed on this kinetic trace. (b) The
same  plot  for  neat  methylcyclohexane  at  295  K.  The  decay  of  κ
  is  almost
perfectly  exponential  (the  experimental  data  are  indicated  by  a  black  curve;  the
exponential fit is given by a faint yellow curve). The vertical arrow in both plots indicates
the  minimum  delay  time  at  which  the  1064  nm  laser  was  pulsed.  Both  saturated
hydrocarbons  exhibit  very  similar  behavior  following  the  1064  nm  photoexcitation  of
their ionized solutions.

How can Brane World physics influences the formation of a 
cosmological constant relevant to graviton production?

Abstract  
 

 

  We  use  an  explicit  Randall-Sundrum  brane  world  effective  potential  as  congruent  with  conditions  needed  to  form  a 
minimum entropy starting point for an early universe vacuum state. We justify this by pointing to the Ashtekar, Pawlowski, 
and Singh (2006) article about a prior universe being modeled via their quantum bounce hypothesis which states that this 
prior universe geometrically can be modeled via a discretized Wheeler – De Witt equation, with it being the collapsing into 
a  quantum  bounce  point  singularity  converse  of  the  present  day  universe  expanding  from  the  quantum  bounce  point  so 
delineated in their calculations. In doing so, we use thermal/ gravitational inputs into our present universe, using a simplified 
model of graviton production similar to what was done by Wheeler in the 1970s for spin two gravitons. Doing so permits 
modeling of experimental conditions needed for directional graviton production. This answers the apparent incongruency of 
low entropy, low temperatures postulated by S. Carroll, and J. Chen, with a naturally occurring ‘laboratory’ as to necessary 
and sufficient conditions needed to model graviton production on a large scale.

I.   INTRODUCTION 

2(2005) , and 
Our present paper is in response to suggestions by Dr. Wald0F
others in the physics department in the U. of Chicago about a Jeans instability criteria leading to low entropy states 
of the universe at the onset of conditions before inflationary physics initiated expansion of inflaton fields. We agree 
with their conclusions and think it ties in nicely with the argument so presented as to a burst of relic gravitons being 
produced.  This  is  leading  to  thermal  inputs  into  a  newly  nucleated  universe  which  leads  to  intense  graviton 
production. Here is why we took this path of analysis.

numerical density equation for gravitons written up by Weinberg as of 19716F
a frequency value divided by a thermal value, T, minus 1. If the frequency value is initially quite high, and the input 
given by a prior universe ‘bounce’, with an initial very high value of energy configuration, then we reason that this 
would be enough to introduce a massive energy excitation into a thermally cooled down axion wall configuration 
1210  Kelvin forming  at  or  before  a  Planck 
which  would  then  lead  to  the  extreme  temperatures  of  approximately 
interval of time  Pt
, plus a melt down of the axion domain wall, which we then says presages formations of a Guth 
style inflationary quadratic and the onset of chaotic inflationary expansion.  This will lead to what we report in the 
end  part  of  our  article,  namely  relic  graviton  production  in  the  onset  of  inflation.  This  is  in  tandem  with  a  brane

I.e.  there  was  a  major  drop  off  of  density  values  from  earlier  conditions  to  the  present  era.  And  this  is  not  even 
getting close to the density values one would have for times 
 which we will comment upon later. Given this 
though. let us now look at some consequences of this drop off of density

III.          THE WHEELER GRAVITON PRODUCTION FORMULA FOR RELIC 
GRAVITONS

This  formula  predicts  what  was  suggested  earlier.  A  surge  of  gravitons  commences  due  to  a  rapid  change  of 
temperature. I.e. if the original temperature were low, and then the temperature rapidly would heat up?  Here is how 
we can build up a scenario for just that. Eqn. (21) above suggests that at low temperatures we have a large busts of 
gravitons.

Now,  how  do  we  get  a  way  to  get  theωand 
frequency  range  for  gravitons,  especially  if  they  are  relic 
gravitons?  First of all, we need to consider that certain researchers claim that gravitons are not necessarily massless, 
and in fact the Friedman equation acquires an extra dark-energy component leading to accelerated expansion. The 
mass of the graviton allegedly can be as large as ~ (1015 cm)-1 .This is though if we connect massive gravitons with 
dark  matter  candidates,  and  not  necessarily  with  relic  gravitons.    Having  said  this  we  can  note  that  Massimo 
12  writes  in  an  introduction  to  his  Phys  Rev  D  article  about  presenting  a  model  which  leads  to  post-
Giovannini1
inflationary phases whose effective equation of state is stiffer than radiation. We also are as stated earlier , stating that 
the  energy  input  into  the  frequency  range  so  delineated  comes  from  a  prior  universe  collapse  ,  as  modeled  by Ashtekar,  A., 
Pawlowski, T. and Singh, P (2006) via their quantum bounce model as given by quantum loop gravity calculations. 
We will state more about this later in this document. 
 
Let us now consider a suitable axion wall boundary model for the relic gravitons to hit into. I.e. we look at axion 
13 about conditions in the early universe (1991) with his Eqn. (10.27) vanishing and 
walls specified by Kolb’s book1
collapsing to Guths quadratic inflation. I.e. having the quadratic contribution to an inflation potential arise due to the 
vanishing of the axion contribution of the first potential of Eqn. (18) above with a temperature dependence of

temperatures, and becomes massive as the temperature drops. Here, N>1 leads to tipping of the wine bottle potential, 
and N degenerate CP-conserving minimal  values. The interested reader is urged to consult section 10.3 of Kolb’s 
early universe book for additional details. This is in tandem with supposing that axion walls abruptly vanishing due 
to  a  heat  up  of  initial  conditions  being  congruent  with  the  following  figure  given  below.  Where  the  pop  up  so 
alluded to is in tandem with the production of a bubble formation, described by Coleman - de Luccia instanton. The 
novel part of this discussion is that it also assumes that relic graviton production occurred during the pop up process 
and ceased as the scalar potential reached its final state. 
 
Another  take  on  Eqn.  (18)  is  that  the  domain  walls  are  removed  via  a  topological  collapse  of  domain  walls  as 
alluded to by the Bogomolnyi inequality. This would pre suppose that early universe conditions are in tandem with 
14.  Those  wishing  to  see  a  low  dimensional  condensed

16 can consider how we can look at conditions for how Eqn. 18 may be linked to a false vacuum

the  axion  walls  with  a  small  term  added  on,  which  is  congruent  with,  after  axion  wall  disappearance  with  Guths

Given this, let us consider a four dimensional potential system, which is for initial low temperatures, and then next 
consider how higher temperatures may form, and lead to the disappearance of axion walls. To do this we refer to

This scaled potential structure will be instrumental in forming a Randall Sundrum effective potential 

The  consequences  of  the  fifth-dimension  considered  in  Eqn. (23)  show  up  in  a  simple  warped  compactification 
involving two branes, i.e., a Planck world brane, and an IR brane. Let's call the brane where gravity is localized the 
Planck  brane  The  first  brane  is  a  four  dimensional  structure  defining  the  standard  model  ‘universe’,  whereas  the 
second brane is put in as structure to permit solving the five dimensional Einstein equations. Before proceeding, we 
need  to  say  what  we  call  the  graviton  is,  in  the  brane  world  context.    A  localized  graviton  plus  a  second  brane 
separated from the brane on which the standard model of particle physics is housed provides a natural solution to the 
hierarchy problem—the problem of why gravity is so incredibly weak.

world quantum style fluctuations contributing to the evolution of the Friedman equations and scale factor evolution 
from  early  universe  times.  The  problems  do  not  end here.  In  addition, we  need  to  consider  entropy  in  the  VERY 
early universe .i.e. a weird set of conditions which pretty much force us to consider thermal/energy inputs into a new 
universe via a prior universe’s quantum bounce. 

VI.       SETTING UP CONDITIONS FOR ENTROPY BOUNDS VIA BRANE WORLD 
PHYSICS, AND LEADING UP TO THE NECESSITY OF A QUANTUM BOUNCE TO 
BRIDGE TO TEMPERATURE REGIMES SEEN IN CHAOTIC INFLATION. 

Our starting point here is showing equivalence of entropy formulations in both the Brane world and the more typical 
four dimensional systems. A Randall-Sundrum Brane world will have the following as a line element and we will 
continue  from  here  to  discuss  how  it  relates  to  holographic  upper  bounds  to  both  anti  De  sitter  metric  entropy 
expressions and the physics of dark energy generating systems. 

To begin with,  let  us  first start  with  the  following  as  a   

 model of  tension on brane  systems,  and  the  line

Low entropy conditions for initial conditions, as stated above give a clue as to the likely hood of low temperatures as 
a starting point via R. Easther et al. (1998) relationship of a generalized non brane world entropy bound, assuming 
 bosonic  degrees  of  freedom  and  T  as  generalized  temperature,  so  we  have  as  a  temperature  based

Abbay  Ashtekar’s  quantum  bounce  inputs  of  energy  from  a  prior  universe  gives  us  a  way  out  of  the  seeing 
impossibility  of  bridging  the  low  entropy  –  low  temperature  conditions  postulated  for  the  early  universe,  and  the 
massive temperature run up seen in early inflationary conditions for Guth style chaotic inflation. In addition, we are 
also postulating that a collapse of axion domain walls so configured as axions cease to exist as far as domain wall   
contributions to the onset of conditions configured for chaotic inflation. This would in its own way remove the weird 
situation showing up in Eqn. (40) above with its manifestly unphysical small bound required for fluctuations as a 
result of brane world evolution. 

VII.   DI QUARK POTENTIAL SYSTEMS AND THE WHEELER DE-WITT 
EQUATION 

Abbay Ashtekar’s quantum bounce gives a discrete version of the Wheeler De Witt equation, as well as a Gaussian 
input  functional  into  the  quantum  bounce4,5.  As  already  mentioned    Θ  is  a  difference  operator,  allowing  for  a 
treatment of the scalar field as an ‘emergent time’ or ‘internal time’ so that one can set up a wave functional built 
about a Gaussian wave functional defined via  

This is for a crucial ‘momentum’ value

The existence of gravitons in itself would be able to either confirm or falsify the existence of non LP structure in the

With the advent of this re definition of momentum we are seeing what Ashtekar works with as a simplistic structure 
with a revision of the differential equation assumed in Wheeler – De Witt theory to a form characterized by 

Θ In this situation is such that  

This in itself would permit confirmation of if or not a quantum bounce condition existed in early universe geometry, 
according  to  what  Ashtekar’s  two  articles  predict.  In  addition  it  also  corrects  for  another  problem.  Prior  to  brane 
theory we had a too crude model. Why? When we assume that a radius of an early universe—assuming setting the

 An appropriate value for a Gaussian representation of an instanton awaits more detailed study. But for whatever it is 
worth we can refer to the known spaleraton value for a multi dimensional instanton via the following procedure. We 
wish to have a finite time for the emergence of this instanton from a pre inflation state.

If so, then, most likely, the question we need to ask though is the temperature of the ‘pre inflationary’ universe and 
its  link  to  graviton  production.  This  will  be  because  the  relic  graviton  production  would  be  occurring  before  the 
nucleation of a scalar field.  We claim, as beforehand that this temperature would be initially quite low, as given by 
1210  degrees Kelvin after the dissolving 
the two University of Chicago articles, but then rising to a value at or near 
of the axion wall contribution given in the dominant value of Eqn. (19) leading to Eqn (20) for a chaotic inflationary 
potential. 

VIII.     GRAVITON SPACE PROPULSION SYSTEMS 

We  need  to  understand  what  is  required  for  realistic  space  propulsion.  To  do  this,  we  need  to  refer  to  a  power 
spectrum  value  which  can  be  associated  with  the  emission  of  a  graviton.  Fortunately,  the  literature  contains  a 
working  expression  as  to  power  generation  for  a  graviton  being  produced  for  a  rod  spinning  at  a  frequency  per

The first column entry is assuming a constant energy input due to Ashtekar’s quantum bounce entry4,5of energy into 
an  axion  ‘cavity’  region  which  would  shortly  afterwards  ‘warm  up’  and  dissipate  according  to  the  axion  mass 
temperature  dependence  given  by  Eqn.  (21).  However,  in  doing  this,  we  have  that  the  increase  in  temperature  as 
given  in  the  division  of  input  energy  as  specified,  leads  to  a  very  narrow  range  of  power  emission  in  graviton 
generation.  

IX.  CONSIDERATIONS AS TO BRANE WORLD FORMALISM BETWEEN FOUR 

AND FIVE DIMENSIONAL COSMOLOGICAL ‘CONSTANTS’ AND THEIR 
ROLE AS TO GRAVITON PRODUCTION 

Gravitons are also definable as to four and five dimensional brane world representations. Here, we use our bound to 
the  cosmological  constant  to  obtain  a  conditional  escape of  gravitons  from  an  early  universe brane. To begin,  we

In the language of general relativity, anti de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric, vacuum solution of Einstein's 
field equation with a negative cosmological constant Λ. Mathematically, anti de Sitter can be a quotient of group 

This quotient formulation gives to AdSn a homogeneous space structure that tie in with branes. That is, our universe

Hbrane or branes. In this setting, branes, and p-branes, are spatially extended objects that appear 
(3 + 1)-dimensional  2
in string theory. The variable p refers to the dimension of the brane; a 0-brane is a zero-dimensional particle, a 1-
brane is a string, a 2-brane is a "membrane," etc. Every p-brane sweeps out a (p+1)-dimensional world-volume as it 
propagates through space-time. 

How  do  we  link  this  to  our  problem  with  respect  to  di  quark  contributions  to  a  cosmological  constant?  Here  we 
make several claims.

This equation would get dramatically smaller for increasing age of the universe to present conditions, with 
the initial values of it to be similar in ‘form’ to the enormous values of initial energy density outlined above for an 
initial nucleating universe, especially if we model the initial energy as proportional to the square of Eqn. (88) above. 
This, however, has a serious defect in that it does not give a genesis, or origins reference as to how the cosmological

Part of the misconception which  is endemic in this field with respect to forming a cosmological constant 
which  is  consistent  with  known  astrophysics  observations  lies  in  the  difficulty  of  forming  of  an  effective  Field

Again, for early universe conditions, how does one form  Ψ for early states of matter? There is a huge literature on

this subject, which will be referred to at the end of this document3

Eqn. (95)  lead  to  a  cascading  series  of  local  minimum  values,  where  Abbot  scaled  the  local  minimum  values  via

This is in line with a through going construction of a potential system which has ONE transition from a false to a 

true vacuum, rather than the multiple local minimums Abbot used in his washboard potential model. We expect this 
will lead to criteria for formation of the escape of gravitons from an early universe brane construction which evolves 
toward  De  Sitter  space  cosmology  as  a  consequence  of  inflation.  In  addition  we  will  also  address  how  gravitons 
could  exist,  and  tie  in  with  the  initial  production  of  dark  matter-dark  energy,  while  accepting  the  difficulty  of 
detecting  them  in  post  inflationary  cosmology  models  of  galaxies,  and  other  strong  gravitational  centers  seen  in 
present day astrophysics.  

 

XI. FORMING ANSWERS TO DYSONS CHALLENGE TO THE ASTRO PHYSICS 
COMMUNITY ABOUT THE REALITY OF GRAVITONS, I.E. DETECTING 
GRAVITONS AS SPIN 2 OBJECTS WITH AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY 

To briefly review what we can say now about standard graviton detection schemes, as mentioned above, Rothman 
states  that  Dyson  seriously  doubts  we  will  be  able  to  detect  gravitons  via  present  detector  technology27.  The 
conundrum is that if one defines the criterion for observing a graviton as

manuscript,  the  problem  then  becomes  determining  a  cross  section  σ  for  a  graviton  production  process  and

We  can  honestly  say  that  the  scheme  outlined  as  of  Eqn.  (61)  above  appears  to  have  a  chance  go  get  around  the  problems 
mentioned above, but that the earlier, cross section based criteria outlined by Eqn. (97) and Eqn. (98) will doom most detection of 
gravitons unless we have a scheme which initiates a process similar to relic graviton production mentioned in section VIII above. 

XIII. HOW OUR BRANE WORLD COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT MODEL 
COMPARES WITH OTHER DYNAMIC MODELS AS TO EVOLUTION OF THE 
‘COSMOLOGICAL’ CONSTANT.

Should  pressure  as  so  defined  be  defined  via  the  Chaplygin  Gas  model,  i.e.  when    dark  energy  -  dark  matter 
unification is achieved through an exotic background fluid whose equation of state is given by p = - A/ρα  with a 
density given as ( assuming r is a spatial variable, and B a positive constant) 

Here,

We  recover  the  brane  world  picture  so  recovered  in  section  IX  above.  However,  we  also  claim  that  we  need  to 
consider the case where the initial set up  of a vacuum state is formed, thereby avoiding the absurdity of an infinite 
density  value  at  the  onset  of  pre  inflation  physics.  This  is  why  we,  among  other  things  work  with  the  axion  wall 
transformation  alluded  to  in  Eqn.  (18)  above.  We  also  claim  that  Eqn.  (100)  would  contravene  low  entropy-low 
temperature conditions postulated by Sean Carroll and Jennifer Chen in their recent arXIV article (2005). Needless 
to say, F. Rahaman et al include variations of the ‘cosmological constant’ implicitly in their work when they write

XII.        CONCLUSIONS  

Gravitons would appear to be produced in great number in the 
 neighborhood, according to a brane world 
interpretation just given. This depends upon the temperature dependence of the ‘cosmological constant.’ As outlined 
in gr-qc/ 0603021.  This is to correct for the situation created by Eqn. (57) is for a critical temperature  CT  defined in 
the neighborhood of an initial grid of time

A  Randall-Sundrum  effective  potential,  as  outlined  herein,  would  give  a  structure  for  embedding  an  earlier  than  
axion  potential  structure,  which  would  be  a  primary  candidate  for  an  initial  configuration  of  dark  energy  .This 
structure would, by baryogenesis, be a shift to dark energy. We need to get JDEM space observations configured to 
determine if WIMPS are in any way tied into the supposed dark energy released after a 
 
In doing this, we should note the following. First of all, we have reference multiple reasons for an initial burst of 
graviton  activity,  i.e.  if  we  wish  to  answer  Freeman  Dysons  question  about  the  existence  of  gravitons  in  a  relic 
graviton stand point. This builds upon an idea of a semi resonant cavity effect for spin two gravitons, with the walls 
dissolving after ten to the minus 43 seconds, with a build up of temperature, and a steady energy insertion leading to

initiation of inflation takes place 
 
Now  for  suggestions  as  to future research.  In doing so  we  also  will  attempt  to  either  confirm  or  falsify  via  either 
observations from CMB based systems, or direct neutrino physics counting of relic graviton production the exotic 
suggestions given by Holland and Wald for pre inflation physics and/or shed light as to the feasibility of some of the 
mathematical suggestions given for setting the cosmological constant parameter given by other researchers. Among 
other things such an investigation would also build upon earlier works initiated by Kolb, and other scientists who 
investigated  the  cosmological  ‘constant  ‘problem  and  general  scalar  reconstruction  physics  for  early  universe 
models at FNAL during the 1990s Doing all of this will enable us, once we understand early universe conditions to 
37 for gravity based propulsion systems.  As well as 
add more substance to the suggestions by Bonnor, as of 19973
permit  de  facto  engineering  work  pertinent  to  power  source  engineering  for  this  concept  to  become  a  space  craft 
technology. As a final comment, we need to briefly mention some of the short falls of models which purport to have 
dual modeling of dark energy and dark matter. As mentioned in the first section, the Chaplygin Gas model predicts 
when dark energy - dark matter unification is achieved through an exotic background fluid whose equation of state 
is given by p = - A/ρα, and with
< α . The flaws in these models is two fold. For very early universe models, 
the  Friedman  equation  for  evolution  of  the  scale  expansion  model  appears  to  give  undefinable  values  for  a  scale 
,  in  order  to  have  negative 
factor 
acceleration and defined values of the density in Chaplygin Gas models in both early and late time evolution which 
runs right into  resolving the first issue of undefinable scale factor behavior for

 we have a very good agreement with cosmology requirements for both early and later

vacuum  substrate.  Finally,  we  need  to  get  analytical  /  observational  confirmation  as  to  the  feasibility  of  prior 
universe inputs into evolving temperature conditions in the early universe which make sense of the jump in initially 
low  temperature  conditions  as  postulated by  Carroll  and Chen2,  to  the  ten  to  the 12  th  power,  Kelvin,  and higher 
inflationary cosmology temperature values.

The upshot of such modeling would be to find an analytical argument which would among other things determine 
how  the  initial  low  temperature-low  entropy  results  can  be  made  consistent  with  initial  conditions  a  space  drive 
would  need  to  use  to  generate  gravitons,  i.e.  as  a  way  to  initiate  graviton  production  which  would  not  be

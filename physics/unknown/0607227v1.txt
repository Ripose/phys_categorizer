dielectric array of charge-carriers 

Department of Physics, University of Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa 

Johan F. Prins 

Abstract 

It is accepted in the scientific literature that when superconduction manifests, a steady-state current flows 

through a material without an electric field being present; i.e. quite simply said: according to Ohm’s law the 

electric field has to be zero when the resistance is zero. Theoretical models of superconduction ascribe this 

behaviour  to  the  absence  of  scattering  of  the  charge-carriers  after  they  have  formed  a  minimum  energy 

configuration called a Bose-Einstein Condensate. It is argued here that the absence of scattering  within a 

material,  although  absolutely  necessary,  is  not  sufficient  to  explain  why  the  electric  field  between  two 

contacts can become zero in order to register zero resistance. It is concluded that an electric field, and thus 

a resistance, must manifest unless (i) the charge-carriers form part of an array of dielectric centres and (ii) 

the  charge-carriers  can  increase  their  velocities  without  increasing  their  kinetic  energies.  A  model  is 

presented  which  allows  these  seemingly  contradictory  requirements  to  manifest.  The  model  is  fitted  to 

selected  experimental  results  which  have  been  published  for  low-temperature  metals,  YBCO  and  highly-

doped p-type diamond. In each case a satisfactory description of the experimental results is demonstrated.

1. Introduction 

Generation  of  superconduction  at  high  temperatures  is  one  of  the  holy  grails  of  physics.  Tremendous 

excitement ensued after the discovery of superconducting ceramics during the 1980’s [1]. At first there had 

been rapid progress in increasing the critical temperatures of these materials, but eventually a ceiling was 

reached at a critical temperature of ≈130 K. One of the problems hampering progress is that the mechanism 

responsible  for  the  latter  superconduction  is  not  known.  The  BCS  theory  [2],  which  has  been  used  since 

1957 to model superconduction in the low temperature metals, could to date not model the properties of the 

ceramic superconductors. It is, however, still believed that two basic postulates, which can be derived from 

the earlier work of Ginsberg and Landau [3], and on which the BCS theory is also based, must still apply; 

i.e. 

(i) 

The charge-carriers must be bosons 

(ii) 

These charge-carriers (at a suitable critical temperature) form a Bose-Einstein Condensate; i.e. 

all  the  charge-carriers  relax  to  the  “same”  lowest  energy  and  therefore  they  cannot  scatter 

when moving through the superconducting material. 

In the case of the low-temperature  metals the BCS approach  models the charge-carriers as  Cooper pairs. 

According to perturbation analysis, which is similar to those used in quantum field theory, a Cooper pair 

consists of two electrons which are bound together owing to the exchange of virtual phonons; this action 

supposedly “glues” the electrons to form pairs which are then able to act as bosons. The general consensus 

which  is  emerging  is  that  the  “glue”  that  is  responsible  for  forming  boson  charge-carriers  in  the  high-

temperature ceramics might not be phonon-related. Not knowing the actual mechanism for these materials 

has reduced the search for higher temperature superconductors to alchemy! 

Over  the  past  decade  claims  for  superconduction  at  temperatures  higher  than  130  K  have  been 

made on a fairly regular basis. Researchers in this field have become sceptical of such claims and insist on 

more information than a mere drop in the measured resistance to “zero”. The reason for this is that there is 

no experimental measurement possible that can unequivocally prove that the electric potential between two 

contacts (to such a material) is “zero, definitely zero, and nothing else but zero”. Without such a proof, one 

cannot  claim  unequivocally  that  the  material  is  really  a  superconductor:  in  simple  terms;  according  to 

Ohm’s law a material with zero resistance must have no potential difference between two contacts when a 

current  flows  from  one  contact  to  another.  In  fact,  this  is  the  only  characteristic  that  defines  a 

superconductor  unequivocally.  But,  since  there  is  no  voltmeter  that  is  accurate  enough  to  convincingly 

determine zero potential, it has become customary to make additional measurements of related properties. 

The two major effects used, and which are believed to confirm that an electric field is not required to drive 

2 

such a current, are (i) the establishment of non-dissipating circular currents when switching on a magnetic 

field  over  the  material  and  (ii)  demonstration  that  the  Meissner-Ochsenfeld  effect  manifests.  It  is  argued 

here  that  although  these  measurements  do  prove  that  the  charge-carriers  are  not  scattering  within  the 

material (as required by the BCS model); it does not, however, eliminate the possibility that these currents 

have been established by the presence of an electric field. Thus, they do not unequivocally prove that there 

will not be an electric field between two contacts to the material. Additional conditions have to apply for an 

electric field not to be present between two contacts. These conditions are postulated and used to model a 

general mechanism for superconduction that seems to explain all superconductors through which a current 

can flow without an electric field being present under all configurations possible. 

 

2. Traditional magnetic verification of superconduction: circular currents 

2.1 Non-dissipating circular currents 

When  switching on a  magnetic field over a conducting  material, circular currents are  induced during  the 

time that the magnetic field increases from zero to its maximum value. This is in accord with Faraday’s law 

of induction according to which a circular electric field is generated around a changing magnetic field. It is 

accepted in the standard literature on superconduction that this electric field is responsible for driving the 

charge-carriers in order to establish the induced circular currents. This implies that the charge-carriers do 

experience the induced electric field and thus increase their velocities; i.e. they are accelerated. It is known 

experimentally that superconducting charge-carriers experience transient electric fields. One might want to 

argue that this is the expected reaction of the charge-carriers because the electric field is a transient field 

which disappears when the magnetic field has reached its maximum value. The charge-carriers then keep 

on moving in circles without an electric field being present; and this proves that superconduction is taking 

place. 

 

A subtle problem, however, remains. When switching on the magnetic field one can, for example, 

increase  it  at  a  constant  rate  over  a  long  period  of  time.  The  induced  electric  field  will  then  be  constant 

during  most of this time.  According to Lenz’s law the induced electric field must keep on increasing the 

circular currents so that a  magnetic  field is  generated that  opposes the increasing applied  magnetic  field. 

This can only mean that the charge-carriers are being “accelerated” by the induced “non-transient” electric 

field. Thus, although the generation of the circular currents do prove that they will not dissipate when there 

is no electric field, it does not prove that the charge-carriers cannot be accelerated by an electric field, static 

or transient, when such a field is present. In other words, the absence of the electric field might not be a 

result of superconduction; because the field will also be absent in a normal conductor. Furthermore, not all 

the charge-carriers are participating in the formation of these currents; usually only those near the surface. 

Does  this  not  imply  that  these  carriers  have  higher  energies  than  the  rest  of  the  carriers  within  the 

 

 

 

3 

superconducting phase? Does this not make nonsense of the postulate that the charge-carriers are all in the 

“same” minimum energy state as required for the formation of a Bose-Einstein Condensate? 

2.2 Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect 

In the case of the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect, a static  magnetic  field is applied  while the  material is  not 

superconducting. When then cooling the material to become superconducting it is found that the magnetic 

field is expelled from the material. The reason for this is that circular currents appear near the surface of the 

material and they then generate a magnetic field that is equal to and opposite to the applied magnetic field. 

Again,  after  equilibrium  has  been  reached,  there  is  no  electric  field  driving  the  currents;  i.e. 

superconduction is taking place. But does this effect prove that the charge-carriers will not experience an 

electric field when one is present? 

 

Consider  the  material  when  it  is  not  yet  superconducting.  When  a  charge-carrier  moves  in  a 

direction  perpendicular  to  the  applied  magnetic  field  it  will  be  deflected  in  order  to  follow  a  circular 

trajectory around this direction. The Lorentz force acting on the charge-carrier is in reality an electric force 

induced  by  the  movement  of  the  charge-carrier  relative  to  the  magnetic  field.  In  a  resistive  material  the 

charge-carrier will scatter from following a circular trajectory or repeated circular trajectories. The weaker 

the  scattering  becomes,  the  more  easily  it  becomes  to  complete  a  circular  trajectory.  If  the  scattering 

becomes  zero  it  should  keep  on  performing  circular  motion.  More  and  more  charge-carriers  will  then  be 

induced to participate in this movement, until the magnetic field they generate cancels the applied magnetic 

field. Any induced electric field then again falls to zero. Thus the Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect also does not 

prove  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the  charge-carriers  will  not  be  accelerated  by  an  electric  field  when 

such a field is applied. Furthermore, again not all charge-carriers are participating to form the currents; so 

again  the  charge-carriers  are  not  all  at  the  “same”  minimum  energy  as  required  for  a  Bose-Einstein 

Condensate to manifest. 

3. Currents flowing between two contacts through a superconductor 

3.1 Electric field and charge-carrier velocity 

It has just now been concluded that when circular currents are generated by a changing magnetic field, the 

induced electric field could and most probably does accelerate the charge-carriers. So when switching on 

an  electric  field  between  two  contacts  it  should  also  accelerate  the  charge-carries.  In  fact,  it  can  be 

experimentally  verified  that  the  velocities  of  the  charge-carriers  do  increase  when  the  EMF  around  the 

circuit, within which the superconductor is an element, is switched on. This is strong proof that the charge-

carriers within the superconducting element must be accelerated; however, the velocities eventually reach a 

steady-state  value  which  is  related  to  the  magnitude  of  the  EMF.  This  is  exactly  what  happens  when  a 

resistance manifests! If the material is truly superconducting this behaviour must imply that an electric field 

 

 

 

 

4 

is experienced by the charge-carriers between the contacts until they reach a critical velocity, at which point 

the electric field becomes identically zero. How is this possible? 

The  mechanism  which  causes  the  electric  field  to  go  to  zero  when  current  flow  is  induced  by  a 

changing  magnetic  field,  cannot  manifest  between  two  contacts.  Yet,  also  in  the  latter  case,  the  electric 

field must fall to zero once the applicable carrier-velocity has been reached, or else the material cannot be a 

superconductor.  So  why  would  there  be  no  electric  field  once  an  equilibrium-current  manifests  between 

two contacts? If the electric field is zero, it must imply that there must be an inbuilt mechanism that cancels 

the electric field when the charge-carriers reach a critical velocity. It is eminently clear that this mechanism 

cannot be the same as the one for circular currents induced by a magnetic field. The absence of an electric 

field between two contacts can only be explained if the superconductor acts as a perfect dielectric while it 

conducts a critical equilibrium-current between two contacts. 

What  constitutes  a  perfect  dielectric?  When  applying  an  electric  field  across  a  perfect  metal  by 

placing it between two capacitor plates the metal acts as a perfect dielectric; i.e. it totally cancels the field 

within itself. A zero electric field is, however, not possible when applying the field via two contacts so that 

a current flows. In fact, the current flows in an attempt to cancel the field within the metal; but does not 

succeed to do so because the charge-carriers are continuously being replenished at the injecting contact and 

extracted at the end contact. How does a superconductor then manage to cancel an electric field (applied by 

contacts) while a current is flowing at the same time? Nobody has ever given a mechanism for this aspect 

which,  I  postulate,  is  the  most  important  aspect  that  needs  to  be  explained  in  order  to  understand  how 

superconduction manifests. 

 

3.2 Charge-carrier velocity and kinetic energy 

It  is  clear  that  when  the  EMF  is  increased  around  a  circuit  containing  a  superconducting  element,  the 

charge-carriers  are  “accelerated”  to  a  higher  velocity  within  the  superconductor.  Does  this  not  mean  that 

their  kinetic  energies  increase  above  the  minimum  energy  they  require  to  form  a  Bose-Einstein 

Condensate? Furthermore, an increase in their kinetic energies must be dissipated at some stage. Consider, 

for example, a current that flows between the cathode and anode in a vacuum diode. These electrons do not 

scatter  while  they  move  from  one  contact  to  the  other.  Does  this  mean  that  they  are  forming  a 

superconducting  phase?  No  not  at  all!  The  applied  electric  field  accelerates  them  so  that  their  kinetic 

energy increases.  Accordingly, they  have  to shed this energy by scattering  within the anode. Heat is still 

generated; i.e. a resistance manifests. Thus if the kinetic energy of the charge-carriers in a superconductor 

increases when increasing the EMF, one would expect these charge-carriers to similarly scatter within the 

contact they move into. Resistance will then manifest. 

A possible way to try and wriggle out of this dilemma would be to argue that the velocity of the 

charge-carriers  is  determined  by  the  drift  velocity  of  the  charge-carriers  within  the  contacts  to  the 

superconductor. Thus, when charge-carriers are injected at the one contact, they enter with the same drift 

velocity  they  (just)  had  within  this  contact,  and  this  determines  the  “drift  velocity”  within  the 

 

5 

superconductor until they enter the other contact within which they have the same drift velocity. Assume, 

however,  that  the  two  contacts  to  the  superconductor  are  made  of  different  metals  which  have  different 

densities  of  charge-carriers.  Then  the  drift  velocities  within  the  contacts  will  be  different  when  the  same 

current flows through them. If, for example, the drift velocity within the end contact is less than within the 

injecting  contact,  the  superconducting  charge-carriers  will  be  injected  into  the  superconducting  material 

with  a  higher  drift  velocity  than  required  within  the  end  contact.  When  reaching  and  entering  the  latter 

contact their kinetic energy will be higher than required. So they will have to scatter within this contact in 

order to lose energy. This will be registered as resistance. 

4. What happens to the applied electric field between two contacts? 

4.1 A summary 

The salient conclusions drawn from the arguments above can be summarised as follows: 

1. 

There  is  not  a  single  experiment  known  at  present  that  can  be,  or  has  been,  used  to 

conclusively  demonstrate  that  an  electric  field  is  not  required  to  generate  and  maintain  a 

current between two contacts to a superconductor. 

2. 

To fully explain superconduction between two contacts without an electric field being present 

one needs: 

 

(i) 

A mechanism that explains how a current can flow through a superconductor while 

this material simultaneously acts as a perfect dielectric. 

(ii) 

A mechanism that explains why the charge-carriers can enter a contact with a high 

velocity without scattering. 

Is current flow between two contacts possible without an electric field being present? It is clear that this has 

not yet been unequivocally demonstrated by any experiment to date. So we really do not know. Magnetic 

experiments  only  prove  that  circular  currents  can  flow  when  there  is  no  electric  field  present  once  the 

applied magnetic field reaches a constant value. As logically argued above, the same argument cannot be 

used when an electric field is directly applied to manifest between two contacts; i.e. in this case the electric 

field cannot go to zero in the same way. Assuming, however, that such a superconducting phase can exist 

between two contacts, how can the conundrums, listed under point 2, be explained? The perfect dielectric 

required cannot be a perfect metal. The only other type of dielectric known is a material in which dipoles 

are  generated  throughout  the  material  when  applying  an  electric  field  over  the  material.  Thus  to  model 

point 2(i), one is forced to postulate that each charge-carrier must form part of a dielectric array so that it 

can be polarised relative to other opposite charges when an electric field is applied. Point 2(ii) can only be 

explained by making another contentious assumption, which, in turn, raises another conundrum: this is to 

assume  that  although  the  charge-carriers  within  a  superconductor  have  velocities,  and  can  increase  their 

 

 

 

 

6 

velocities, these velocities do not manifest as kinetic energy which requires dissipation within the contact 

that the charge-carriers are moving into. 

4.2 Dielectric properties of a superconductor 

If  the  charge-carriers  can  be  polarised  relative  to  their  opposite  charges  by  an  applied  electric  field,  it 

implies that they must (on average) be stationary when no current is flowing. If the charge of the carriers is, 

for  example,  negative,  they  must  be  “bonded”  to  equal  positive  charges;  i.e.  they  can  either  be  part  of  a 

permanent array of dipoles, or form part of an array of induced dipoles when an external electric field is 

applied.  In  either  case,  such  an  applied  electric  field  must  polarise  the  charge-carriers  relative  to  the 

positive charges that “anchor” them. Such increased polarisation of the charge-carriers must increase their 

energies. If, without polarisation a charge-carrier requires an increase in energy 

CE∆

 to break away from 

its anchor-point, then with polarisation it requires less energy to break away. If there is no applied electric 

field, a charge-carrier will have to acquire more than the energy 

 to break free of its anchor-point and 

CE∆

move  to another, adjacent position  where it can again become anchored. What is the required amount of 

energy? If the charge-carrier has a mass m and it moves with a speed v from its anchor-point to an adjacent 

position,  it  requires  an  amount  of  energy  E∆   to  break  free  of  its  anchor-point  and  reach  the  adjacent 

position which is given by: 

 

 

 

∆=∆

Once  it  reaches  the  adjacent  position  it  will  have  to  get  rid  of  this  energy  if  it  wants  to  again  become 

anchored. 

4.3 Charge-carrier movement without generating kinetic energy 

In  the  standard  scientific  literature  it  is  argued  that  a  “particle”  can  “tunnel  through”  an  energy  barrier. 

Another  (and,  I  believe,  the  scientifically  correct)  way  to  model  “tunnelling”,  is  to  postulate  that  the 

“particle”  can  “borrow  energy”  for  a  short  time  interval 

τ∆   in  order  to  scale  the  energy  barrier.  This  is 

made possible by Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Relationship for energy and time, which is written as: 

 

 

 

=τ∆∆

E

ηg

 

1≥g

 

 

 

 

 

(2) 

The value of g is determined by the wave function representing the charge-carrier. If the two anchor-points 

are separated by a distance R, and the charge-carrier “tunnels” with a speed v from one to the other, then in 

order not to violate Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Relationship, one must have that: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7 

Combining Eqs. 1,2, and 3 leads to:

One can  immediately  see  that  when  R increases, a  maximum  value  R(max)  will be reached above  which 

the  solution  for  v  becomes  a  complex  number;  i.e.  there  exists  a  maximum  velocity  v(max)  for  v.  When 

solving for R(max) and v(max) one obtains that: 

Both parameters, surprisingly, turn out to only depend on the binding energy (

CE∆

). Accordingly, even for 

distances R<R(max) the maximum possible “tunnelling” speed is still given by Eq. 7. 

4.4 A mechanism for current flow and cancelling the applied electric field at the same time 

It is now postulated that to be able to superconduct, a material must contain an array of stationary charge-

carriers,  which  can  be  polarised  by  an  externally  applied  electric  field.  How  such  arrays  can  form,  and 

examples of how to calculate their physical properties have been published elsewhere [4]. When the density 

of such an array becomes high enough, so that the distances R between the charge-carriers along a direction 

within the material become smaller than R(max), the charge-carriers can move from anchor-site to anchor-

site  by  borrowing  energy  as  described  in  section  4.3.  When  only  applying  an  external  electric  field  the 

charge-carriers become polarised. This  will happen very quickly because the array of charge-carriers  will 

act as a dielectric so that the electric field will spread out over them with the same speed that is possible for 

light within such a material. When the electric field is applied via contacts, then simultaneous injection of 

new  charge-carriers  could  occur.  The  original  charge-carries  will  still  become  aware  of  the  electric  field 

and 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8 

spreading through the material at the speed of light, however, they will not become polarised because this 

will increase their energies. They are able to maintain the same energies they have had before the electric 

field  has  been  switched  on  by  “tunnelling”  from  their  anchor-points  to  adjacent  ones;  i.e.  the  charge-

carriers  which  are  injected  at  the  contact,  can  displace  existing  charge-carriers  from  their  anchor-points, 

which in turn can displace other charge-carries from their anchor-points etc. Charge-carrier movement thus 

occurs in order to maintain the lowest energy state as is required by the second law of thermodynamics. 

The important point to notice is that although each charge-carrier has an uncertainty in its energy 

during  its  movement  from  one  anchor-point  to  the  next  equivalent  anchor-point,  it  does  not  permanently 

gain energy; i.e. the energy of a charge-carrier arriving at an anchor-point is the same as the energy it has 

had at the previous anchor-point. The charge-carriers are thus not gaining energy and therefore they cannot 

be scattered when they reach and enter an end-contact. Furthermore, when such a current flows, the charge-

carriers are marching in step  from the one contact to the next. Just as  many charge-carriers are ejected at 

the end contact as those that are injected at the initial contact. Thus, on average, the charge-carrier density 

stays the same as it has been before the current started to flow. Therefore, the carrier-charges and anchor-

charges still act together to manifest a perfect (but now dynamic) dielectric. They cancel the applied field. 

“Real”  superconduction  occurs.  One  might  thus  define  superconduction  as  coherent  “tunnelling”  by  a 

dielectric array of charge-carriers; however, I believe that the term “tunnelling” could be a misleading term. 

“Tunnelling”  implies  a  “particle”  moving  “through”  a  barrier.  Here  the  process  is  described  by  charge-

carriers borrowing energy to scale barriers. Nonetheless, I will call the process coherent “tunnelling” for the 

time being. 

It  should  be  clear  that  when  increasing  the  applied  electric  field  this  will  be  “felt”  by  all  the 

carriers at the speed of light, and they will move faster in order to accommodate the increases in injected 

carriers. This increase in speed, however, still does not manifest as an increase in kinetic energy. 

5. Explaining the properties of superconductors 

5.1 Maximum currents 

It is a well-known experimental fact that a superconductor has a maximum electrical current that can flow 

through it. If one tries to increase the current above this value, it falls away. According to the mechanism 

postulated above (paragraph  4.4), this behaviour becomes  logically consistent. When increasing the field, 

the “drift” speed v increases until it reaches the maximum value possible v(max) (see Eq. 7). Any further 

increase leads to non-real speeds and thus to an impossible current. 

5.2 Temperature behaviour 

Each  charge-carrier  has  a  binding  energy  (

).  Thus  its  bonding  can  be  thermally  destroyed:  i.e.  the 

CE∆

charge-carrier can be excited to a higher energy level. This also causes it to neutralise its positive anchor

charges [4]. If the density of charge-carriers at absolute zero temperature would be N0, then the density of 

charge-carriers N at temperature T can be written as:

Thus, as the temperature increases, the density of charge-carriers N decreases. This means that the average 

distance R (between the carriers) increases. When this distance becomes larger than the maximum distance 

R(max)  (see  Eq.  6),  coherent  tunnelling  is  not  possible  anymore,  and  the  superconducting  current  thus 

disappears.  The  critical  temperature  Tc  has  been  reached.  Since  (according  to  the  present  model) 

superconduction  is  considered  along  a  single  direction,  it  is  the  density  of  charge  carriers  along  this 

direction  that  determines  the  process.  Eq.  8  can  thus  be  written  in  terms  of  the  concomitant  “tunnelling” 

distances as:

5.3 Non-dissipating circular currents revisited 

When switching on a magnetic field, the induced circular electric field will attempt to polarise the charge-

carriers  relative  to  their  anchor-charges;  however,  they  avoid  polarisation  by  rather  tunnelling  along 

circular paths in order to avoid an increase in energy. As already discussed above (for current flow between 

two  contacts)  the  circular  currents  manifest  in  order  to  maintain  a  minimum-energy  dynamic-equilibrium 

state as required by the second law of thermodynamics. Since this is a minimum-energy state, the charge-

carriers cannot, for example, radiate electromagnetic waves. 

5.4 Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect revisited 

When applying a magnetic field, the energy of the charge-carriers also increases. This can be demonstrated 

by solving the Schrödinger equation subject to using the dynamical momentum operator p [4]; i.e.

(10) 

This will not be done here because the solution is different for different materials. It should, however, be 

clear that here, just as in the case of the induced circular currents (paragraph 5.3), the circular currents form 

so that the charge-carriers do not have to increase their energies, and so that the whole system can relax to 

the lowest-energy dynamic-equilibrium state, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. Thus, also 

in this case electromagnetic radiation is not possible.

5.5 Magnetic strength of a superconductor 

When applying a magnetic field, currents evolve to expel the magnetic field, so that the charge-carriers can 

maintain  their  lowest  energy  state  (paragraph  5.4).  As  already  deduced  above  (paragraph  5.1),  such  a 

current cannot be sustained if the magnitude of the velocity required to sustain the opposite magnetic field 

approaches the maximum possible speed v(max). Thus, once the applied magnetic field becomes so large 

that  the  latter  condition  would  be  required,  the  charge-carriers  are  unable  to  tunnel  fast  enough;  the 

superconducting state can thus not manifest. At T=Tc the distances between the charge-carriers are equal to 

R(max).  The  charge-carriers  have  to  tunnel  at  the  maximum  speed  v(max);  i.e.  they  are  moving  at  their 

limit even without a magnetic field being present. When now applying a magnetic field, a higher speed is 

needed to counteract the applied magnetic field: this is not possible. At lower temperatures T<Tc, there are 

more charge-carriers, so that the distances between them are smaller than R(max); i.e. they can transport a 

current at a lower speed than v(max). When now applying a magnetic field, the charge-carriers can move in 

order to manifest a current which, in turn, forms an opposite magnetic field that cancels the applied field. 

This is possible until the magnitude of the applied field becomes so large that the magnitude required, for 

the velocities of the charge-carriers, again becomes too large. Accordingly, as the temperature decreases the 

critical magnetic field required to prevent a superconducting phase from forming will keep on increasing: 

This is exactly as experimentally observed. 

5.6 Josephson tunnelling 

When  Josephson  made  the  theoretical  prediction  that  superconducting  charge-carriers  should  be  able  to 

tunnel  through  a  thin  insulator  [5], John  Bardeen  rejected  this  possibility  because  (Cooper)  “pairing does 

not extend into the barrier, so there can be no such superfluid flow”. Nonetheless Josephson tunnelling was 

subsequently demonstrated by experiment which indicates that Bardeen had been wrong; however, has he 

been wrong? Does Josephson tunnelling not rather prove that the Cooper mechanism is not tenable? 

Josephson  tunnelling  is  a  logical  consequence  of  the  mechanism  postulated  here.  The  charge-

carriers  transport  current  by  tunnelling  from  anchor  point  to  anchor  point,  so  they  should  also  be  able  to 

tunnel “through” a thin insulator. Furthermore, when the distance through which the latter tunnelling occurs 

is different from that within the superconductor, an extra phase shift should result. This can be modelled by 

using simple periodic boundary conditions. This will not be pursued any further here. 

6. Applying the model to experimental results 

6.1 Low-temperature metal superconductors 

According  to  the  model  postulated  here,  superconducting  charge-carriers  must  form  part  of  a  dielectric 

array (see paragraph 4.4.). Is this possible within a metal? According to Eugene Wigner it is possible [6]. 

11 

Electrons  can  form  a  “Wigner  crystal”  within  a  “non-ideal”  metal.  Wigner  analysed  the  validity  of  the 

mean field approach which is used to model electrons in a metal. According to this approach each electron 

is  fully  screened  by  the  other  electrons  so  that  they  do  not  experience  the  positive  charges  on  the  metal 

ions.  He  found  that  for  “non-ideal”  metals,  a  metal-insulator  transition  should  occur  (at  a  low  enough 

temperature) through the formation of an array of electron-related pseudo-particles (which will be referred 

to  as  orbitals)  which  are  stationary.  This  occurs  because  the  electrons  now  become  aware  of  the  positive 

charges  and  therefore  they  relax  to  a  lower  energy  in  order  to  form  such  an  array.  The  orbitals  are 

stationary  because  each  of  them  is  anchored  by  the  positive  charges  that  form  when  the  concomitant 

electrons  de-excite  from  their  mean-field  energy  states.  There  is,  of  course  no  reason  why  these  orbitals 

could  not  be  bi-electron  orbitals.  In  fact  they  most  probably  will  be,  because  such  an  array  will  have  a 

lower energy. Wigner also deduced that each orbital should radially be a Gaussian-shaped wave function. 

Once all the mean-free electrons have lost energy to form orbitals. The electrons are all localised 

at specific lattice sites; therefore the term “Wigner crystal”. For this reason the metal should then become 

an insulator; however, according to the model proposed here, superconduction should be possible along any 

direction  if  the  distances  R  (between  the  orbitals)  become  short  enough.  This  implies  that  the  charge-

carriers  are  formed  by  a  quantum  mechanical  mechanism  that  is  similar  to  the  one  responsible  for  the 

formation of stationary bi-electron orbitals around the nucleus of the atom. No “virtual” phonon interaction 

is involved to “bind” the electrons together. It also immediately explains why high quality conductors like 

gold and copper do not display superconduction; Wigner crystals cannot form within such materials. 

 

The experimental points shown in Fig. 1 have been measured by Townsend and Sutton [7]. A thin 

insulating layer was sandwiched between the superconductor and a normal metal. The insulator was made 

thin enough so that single electrons can tunnel through it. An electric potential  Φ was then applied over the 

insulating  layer.  Charge-carriers  within  the  superconductor  that  tunnelled  into  the  insulating  layer 

experienced the resultant field within the layer and they accelerated. According to the BCS model, the two 

electrons constituting each superconducting charge-carrier, are bonded together by the exchange of virtual 

phonons in order to form a Cooper pair, and the resultant binding energy is given by 

SCE∆

. Thus, as soon 

as a charge-carrier has accelerated so that each of its electrons has gained energy of ½ SCE∆

, it breaks up 

into  two  separate  entities.  By  measuring  the  potentials, 

SΦ ,  at  which  single  electrons  reach  the  opposite 

side  of  the  insulator,  one  can  calculate  the  binding  energy  from  ½

∆

E

Φ=

S

SC

.  According  to  the  BCS 

theory  the  increase  in 

SCE∆

with  decreasing  temperature  relates  to  an  increase  in  the  effectiveness  of 

electron-phonon coupling. 

According to the model espoused here, the two electrons are bonded by a constant binding energy 

equal to

CE∆

. When such an orbital tunnels into the insulator with a speed v it is accelerated to increase its 

speed further until the total kinetic energy equals the binding energy. At this point the bi-electron charge-

carrier split into two separate entities, which can tunnel further on their own. The amount of extra energy 

 

 

12 

needed after the charge-carrier enters the insulator is thus 

∆ CE

−

½mv2, and this is equal to 

SCE∆

; i.e. the 

following equation describes the process:

The mass  m  has been  taken as equal to twice the electron  mass (since the orbital is a pseudo-particle the 

mass  could  be  different).  As  the  temperature  decreases,  the  speed  of  tunnelling  v  also  decreases  so  that 

SCE∆

 increases. The theoretical curves in Fig. 1 have been fitted according to the model postulated above 

in conjunction with Eq. 11; i.e. in conjunction with Eqs. 5 and 9. The binding energy for tin is found to be 

cE∆ =1.4  meV  and  for  tantalum 

cE∆ =1.68  meV.  The  BCS  theory  does  not  render  such  high  quality 

theoretical curves [7]. 

It is important to note that within a material the electronic levels are also functions of the phonon 

spectrum.  For  this  reason  it  has  become  customary  to  talk  of  “vibronic”  levels.  Thus  if  the  atoms  are 

replaced  by  their  isotopic  counterparts,  the  orbital  energy  ∆EC  will  change.  So  will  then  the  critical 

temperature Tc. Thus, the isotope effect in the low temperature superconductors need not relate to phonon 

exchange  between  electrons  at  all.  In  fact,  I  believe  that  modelling  superconductors  in  terms  of  Cooper 

pairs and getting some semblance of correspondence with experimental results have been fortuitous. 

6.2 Superconduction in heavily-doped p-type diamond 

It  has  been  discovered  that  heavily-doped  p-type  diamond  superconducts  at  low  temperatures  [8].  The 

dopant density is so high that the density of boron acceptors is on average above the threshold for the Mott 

transition; i.e. they form an impurity-band. Attempts have thus been made to model the mechanism along 

the  rules  of  the  BCS  theory,  but  without  any  success.  Experimental  data  points  measured  on  such  a 

diamond by Bustarret et al are shown in Fig. 2 [9]. 

When a semiconductor becomes highly doped so that impurity-band conduction ensues, not all of 

the  dopant  centres  become  delocalised.  At  the  edges  of  the  impurity-band  there  are  tails  of  localised 

centres,  below  the  so-called  mobility  edge  of  the  impurity-band.  Thus,  as  the  width  of  the  acceptor 

impurity-band  increases  with  increased  doping,  localised  acceptor  states  are  forming  at  lower  and  lower 

energies  relative  to  the  valence  band.  When  the  temperature  decreases  to  a  low  enough  value,  the 

delocalised  acceptor  states  will  depopulate  and  the  lower  energy  localised  states  will  be  the  only  ones 

which still accommodate electrons. Eventually only the lowest-energy states will on average have electrons 

and  they  will  then  depopulate  when  the  temperature  drops  further.  At  this  stage  the  Fermi-level  should 

energetically  lie  about  half-way  between  the  impurity  band  and  the  valence  band.  This  is  so  because  the 

impurity band now acts as a “conduction” band. Although the activation energy 

HE∆

 for hole-generation in 

the valence band has now become very small, the density of holes must still be proportional to the density 

of acceptors NA; so that one can write that:

C is a proportionality constant which is a function of the valence band electron-state density and might be a 

weak  function  of  temperature.  By  using  this  equation  in  conjunction  with  the  equations  above,  and 

assuming that the binding energy 

CE∆

is equal to 2

HE∆

 the curve in Fig. 2 has been fitted theoretically to 

the data points. The value obtained for the binding energy is 

=

0.41 meV and the maximum distance at 

∆ cE

which  superconduction  sets  is  R(max) = 96.4  Ǻ.  This  implies  that  the  density  of  the  shallow-energy 

acceptor levels responsible for the superconducting phase to just form at absolute zero must be 

181011 x.≈

 

cm-3; a very plausible result. 

It  is  important  to  note  that  the  charge-carriers  have  here  been  modelled  as  single  holes;  i.e. 

fermions.  As  the  temperature  increases  more  electrons  are  excited  from  the  valence  band,  the  density  of 

holes decreases until the distances between them become larger that R(max); superconduction then ceases. 

The following question might now arise: why would the holes move to replace other holes when they are 

surrounded by acceptor centres populated by electrons? Should the electrons not tunnel into adjacent holes? 

They  might  do  just  that,  however,  even  if  the  electrons  do  tunnel,  the  average  density  of  holes  does  not 

change. 

6.3 Ceramic superconductors: YBCO 

YBCO  is  probably  the  best  studied  ceramic  superconductor.  Within  the  perfect  YBCO  orthorhombic 

structure,  which  itself  constitutes  a  superconducting  phase,  the  number  of  oxygen  atoms  per  unit  cell  is 

equal  to  7.  YBCO  is,  like  most  of  these  materials,  a  layered  structure.  CuO2  planes  are  separated  by  Y 

atoms.  Below  these  planes  there  are  BaO  planes  and then  planes  within  which  oxygen  atoms  are  aligned 

along  chains.  In  YBCO,  as  in  many  of  the  other  related  “high-temperature”  superconducting  materials, 

oxygen is usually stoichiometrically deficient so that the number of oxygen atoms per unit cell is less than 

7.  It  is  found  experimentally  that  superconduction  occurs  as  long  as  this  number  of  oxygen  atoms  lies 

within the following limits 6.4<y≤7. When y reaches the value 6, it is believed that there are none or very 

few oxygen atoms forming oxygen chains. Superconduction relates to the presence of the latter atoms. This 

is  demonstrated  by  the  experimental  data  points  in  Fig.  3,  which  have  been  measured  and  reported  by 

Segawa  and  Ando  [10].  The  critical  temperature  increases  as  the  oxygen  content  y  increases  above  the 

value 6.4. There is, however, a plateau with the critical temperature at ≈60 K for values of y between 6.6 

and 6.8. 

It will now be postulated that the oxygen atoms within the chains are (part of) donor centres which 

supply electrons which form arrays of bi-electron orbitals. The most probable manner in which these arrays 

can form is between the crystallographic planes. The possible mechanism involved has been modelled and 

14 

published elsewhere [4]. The orbitals are Gaussian-shaped waves parallel to the crystallographic planes and 

are  anchored  by  positive  charges  that  reside  on  donors  within  the  crystallographic  planes.  In  the  case  of 

YBCO the density Ne of electrons, which are available to form the required charge-carrier arrays, can thus 

be equated to the stoichiometric density y of the oxen atoms by writing that: 

 

 

 

 

N e

=

0−
)yy(C

   

 

 

 

(13) 

C is a proportionality constant that also adjusts the units, and y0 is the density of oxygen atoms which are 

not situated along the chains. By using this equation in conjunction with the equations derived above, the 

theoretical curves shown in Fig. 3 have been fitted to the experimental data points. The dotted curve is an 

average  fit  through  all  the  data  points.  In  turn,  the  solid  curve  has  been  fitted  through  all  the  data  points 

with the highest critical temperatures. For both curves one finds that y0 is not equal to 6. For the solid curve 

it is y0=5.348. This indicates that not all the non-chain oxygen sites have been filled when the chains started 

to form. Therefore one can explain the 60 K plateau as follows: when increasing the oxygen atoms, they at 

first keep on adding mostly to the chain-sites while those atoms not in chain positions stayed approximately 

constant at y0=5.348. The plateau initiates when some, if not all the oxygen atoms being added, start to fill 

non-chain positions, until y0 becomes equal to 6. After this point is reached, all the additional oxygen has to 

fill chain-positions again and the data points increase to again fall on the solid curve. The decrease in Tc, 

when  y  is  equal  to  7,  can  be  explained  by  a  decrease  in 

  when  the  charge-carrier  density  increases 

CE∆

beyond a certain value [4]. The critical distance between the orbitals at which superconduction sets in can 

be calculated from Eq. 7 and it is found to be R(max)≈7.2 Ǻ. It is approximately twice the lattice spacing 

along  the  basal  plane  of  YBCO;  a  very  satisfactory  result.  The  binding  energy  for  a  bi-electron  charge-

carrier is found to be 

CE∆

≈37.6 meV; also a very plausible result. 

Since  the  orbitals  form  between  the  crystallographic  planes,  the  orbitals  cannot  interact  directly 

with the phonon-levels within the crystallographic layers; i.e. their energies are not vibronic [4]. Thus, one 

does  not  expect  a  strong  isotope  effect  as  is  observed  for  the  low  temperature  metals;  this  is  just  as 

observed experimentally. This also indicates that in MgB2, which shows an isotope effect, superconduction 

occurs within the crystallographic layers even though this material has a layered structure. 

7. Discussion and conclusion 

The  mechanism  proposed  for  superconduction  in  this  exposé  explains  the  known  properties  of 

superconducting materials very well (see paragraph 5). It also models the measured properties of different 

types  of  superconductors,  be  it  low  temperature  metals,  “high-temperature”  ceramics  or  semiconducting 

superconductors,  very  well  (see  paragraph  6).  What  is  especially  satisfying  is  that  a  single  mechanism 

describes all these different materials. 

The  proposed  mechanism  is  not  based  on  the  requirements  that  electrons  must  pair  and  the 

resultant  boson  charge-carriers  must  then  form  a  Bose-Einstein  Condensate.  In  fact,  the  superconducting 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15 

phase  that  forms  in  highly-doped  p-type  diamond  can  be  adequately  modelled  in  terms  of  the  coherent 

tunnelling of holes; which are fermions. Although one can argue that the charge-carriers are all in the same 

minimum energy state as required for a Bose-Einstein Condensate, the dielectric array which is required for 

superconduction to manifest can be understood in terms of an array of separate entities; i.e. localised states. 

The  role  that  quantum  mechanics  plays  is  through  Heisenberg’s  Uncertainty  Relationship  for  energy  and 

time. This allows the charge-carriers to “tunnel” so that they can increase their velocities without increasing 

their kinetic energies. Thus, a mere absence of scattering of the charge-carriers, although necessary, is not 

(on its own) sufficient to ensure that superconduction will occur.

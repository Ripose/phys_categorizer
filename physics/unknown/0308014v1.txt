Abstract 

To  study  and  develop  wall-functions  for  low-Reynolds-number  models,  a  model  linear 

equation is introduced. This equation simulates major mathematical peculiarities of the low-

Reynolds-number model  including a near  wall sub-layer  and transition  region. Dirichlet and 

Newman boundary-value problems are considered. The standard and analytical wall-functions 

are investigated on different properties including the mesh sensitivity of a solution. A Robin-

type  interpretation  of  wall  functions  as  boundary  conditions  is  suggested.  It  is  shown  that 

solution  of  a  problem  is  mesh  independent  and  more  accurate  in  this  case.  General  type 

analytical  and  numerical  wall-functions  are  developed  on  the  basis  of  a  boundary  condition 

transfer.  An  effective  numerical  method  of  decomposition  is  suggested.  The  method  can  be 

used in application to either high-Reynolds-number models with the numerical wall-functions 

or  low-Reynolds-number  models  directly.  Although  a  model  equation  is  considered,  the 

formulas, methods and conclusions are valid and can be directly used for real low-Reynolds-

number equations. 

1. Introduction 

The  problem  of  mathematical  simulation  of  turbulent  flows  near  walls  appears  in  many 

practical applications. It is well known that turbulence vanishes near a wall due to the no-slip 

boundary condition for the velocity as well as the blocking effect caused by the wall. In the 

vicinity of the wall, there is a thin sub-layer with predominantly molecular diffusion. The sub-

layer has a substantial influence upon the remaining part of the flow. An adequate numerical 

resolution  of  a  solution  in  the  sub-layer  requires  a  very  fine  mesh  because  of  sub-layer 

thinness and high gradients of the solution. It makes a model used time consuming and often 

not  suitable  for  industrial  applications.  Because  of  low  velocities,  the  models  resolving  the 

sub-layer are called the low-Reynolds-number models (LR models).  

 

To  avoid  the  problem  related  to  the  sub-layer  resolution  so-called  high-Reynolds-

number  models  (HR models) have been developed. In this a type of models the sub-layer is 

not directly resolved.  It allows one to save computational efforts many times over [1]. In the 

HR models, the boundary conditions or near-wall profiles are replaced by wall-functions. In 

most cases, the wall-functions are semi-empirical and have very limited applications [1-3].  A 

brief  review  of  different  wall-functions  used  can  be  found  in,  e.g.  [1].  Sub-grid  numerical 

wall-functions are developed in [2] where the dependent variables are determined by solving 

boundary-layer-type  transport  equations  in  a  sub-grid.  In  this  approach,  the  boundary 

condition on the boundary that is external to the wall is determined by linear interpolation of 

certain  main-grid  values.  In  [3],  the  analytical  wall-functions  are  evolved  by  integrating 

boundary-layer-type  equations  analytically  under  some  simplifying  assumptions. At the  wall 

the boundary conditions are the same as the ones used in the LR models. Then, the analytical 

profiles are used in the cell nearest to the wall to reconstruct the near-wall solution. 

 

In  the  following  sections  we  study  the  analytical  wall-function  approach  [3]  for  the 

case  of  a  model  linear  equation.  This  model  equation  allows  us  to  simulate  the  major 

mathematical  peculiarities  of  LR  models.  A  method  of  boundary  condition  transfer  is 

developed. The method allows us to move the boundary conditions from the wall outside of 

the  sub-layer.  The  boundary  conditions  developed  are  Robin  type  and  can  be  interpreted  as 

wall-functions.  It  is  possible  to  obtain  such  boundary  conditions  both  analytically  and 

numerically.  In  the  former  case  the  boundary  conditions  can  be  obtained  exactly.  A 

decomposition  method  is  also  suggested.  The  method  allows  us  to  split  the  boundary-value 

problem  into  two  problems:  a  problem  internal  to  the  wall  and  an  external  one.  Both 

boundary-value problems are solved independently, which yields the terminal solution. 

 

 

2. Model equation  

Considering the following model equation: 

defined in a domain Ω = [0 1]. 

Where (cid:181) = (1 (cid:150) exp(-y/ε) + δ)/Re,  ε << 1, δ << 1, Re >> 1, n > 0. 

 ((cid:181)uy)y + yn uy = C,                                                 (1) 

The first term simulates dissipative terms in the Navier-Stokes equations, whereas the second 

term  models  the  contribution  of  convective  terms  and  the  right  hand  side  represents  the 
pressure  gradient  term  or  source  in  the  transport  equations.  The  (cid:147)viscosity(cid:148)  coefficient  µ 

corresponds  to  the  effective  viscosity  coefficient.  The  coefficient  is  rapidly  changed  from  a 
relatively small value (cid:181)l = δ /Re (laminar viscosity) to a (cid:147)turbulent(cid:148) viscosity (cid:181)t ≈ 1/Re.  

The  equation simulates  the  low-Reynolds-number effects and can be considered as a 
model equation for the LR model. The left hand side point in the domain Ω will be treated as 

a (cid:147)wall(cid:148). The low-Reynolds-number effects occur nearby this point. If we set (cid:181) = (1+ δ )/Re 

in (1), we have the HR approach. 

Furthermore,  we  will  consider  the  following  values  for  the  constants:  Re  =  102,  ε  = 
 
3*10-2, δ = 10-2. For simplicity the right-hand side will be considered as the constant C = -1 

although this assumption is not important for our consideration.  

  

Consider the following boundary-value Dirichlet problem: 

((cid:181)uy)y + yn uy = C                                                         (2) 

u(0) = u0    u(1) =  u1 

In the case of n = 2, u0 = 0 and u1 = 7, the solution is shown in Figure 1. The profile includes 
both  the  linear  near-wall  and  logarithmic  parts.  Near  the  wall,  u  =  ε  ln(1+y/(εδ)).  The 
thickness of the viscous (cid:147)sub-layer(cid:148), where u is a linear function, can be approximated as yv ≈ 
εδ.  

 

Fig.1 The exact solution. 

 

In the calculations, the compact scheme [4] is used. The scheme allows us to calculate both 

the function and its derivative with a fourth-order of approximation. In Table 1, the results of 
calculations  of  the  (cid:147)friction(cid:148)  τw=  µwdu/dy(0)  (here  µw=µ(0))  are  given  on  different  meshes. 

To exclude questions concerned with a mesh adaptation, a uniform mesh is used.

If we use the HR model with the same boundary conditions, then τw  = 4.9*10-1, which shows 

the importance of the sub-layer.  

 

3. Wall functions  

3.1 Standard wall-function 

To  use  the  HR  model,  the  wall  boundary  condition  can  be  substituted  by  wall-functions.  In 

this case, we set the boundary condition outside the sub-layer. In fluid mechanics, the classic 

wall-function is given by the law of the wall. It corresponds to the log-profile.  In our case, it 

means the following local relation:

where ζ  is a constant defined from experiments. We assume that it is equal to zero. 

3.2 Analytical wall-function 

In  [3],  the  analytical  wall  functions  have  been  developed.  To  obtain  them,  the  governing 

equation is integrated in the vicinity of a wall under the assumption that all terms besides the 

dissipative one are constant. Mainly, it means that the contribution of the convective terms is 

neglected near the wall and that the pressure gradient and buoyancy force (if applicable) are 

not changed. In this case, the following equation is integrated 

                                                                 ((cid:181)uy)y  = C                                                              (4) 

Following [3], we assume a linear approximation for the viscosity µ in the sub-layer:

Outside of the sub-layer (cid:181) = (1 + δ)/Re. 
Such an approximation looks reasonable. The error in the 1st norm is as follows:  

|| (cid:181)ex (cid:150) (cid:181)ap||1 ≈ 10-2 

The difference between the exact and approximate values of (cid:181) is given in Figure 2 (yv 

= δε).

Here Re/(1 + δ) ≈ Re. 
In approximate solution (6) there are two integration constants, namely: u0 and τw. One of 

which  is  known  from  the  boundary  condition.  Generally  speaking,  other  types  of  the 

boundary  conditions  are  possible,  e.g.,  mixed  conditions  or  Robin-type  boundary 
conditions. Only cases of a Dirichlet problem (u0 is known) and a Newman problem (τw is 

known) are considered because they most common in applications. It is interesting to set 

the  exact  values  of  both  constants  and  compare  with  the  exact  solution.  Such  a 

comparison is shown in Figure 3 for problem (2). The exact solution (solid line) and the 

two approximations for yv are represented: δε (dotted-dashed line) and 3δε (dashed line). 

In the latter case (yv= 3δε) the correspondence with the exact solution is better.  

                                 Fig. 3. Near wall profiles. Solid line is exact solution, 
                                            dotted-dashed line (yv = δε), dashed line (yv =3δε) 
 

 

Relations (6) correspond to the analytical wall-functions [3]. According to [3], if u0 is known, 

the  HR  model  can  be  used  with  the  boundary  condition  for  u0.  The  profile  in  the  first 

computational cell is then completed with (6). In particular, relation (6) allows us to estimate 
τw.  

In  Table  2,  the  results  of  the  computation  of  τw  are  given  on  different  meshes  using  the 

standard wall-function (3) and analytical wall-function (6). In the second row, y+1 is the value 

of y+ = 

ντ /yw

 (ν = δ/Re) at the point nearest to the wall. The analytical wall-functions are 

considered for two values of yv: yv = δε (1) and yv = 3δε (2).

                     The exact solution is 0.34. Analytical 1 is yv = δε; analytical 2 is yv = 3δε.  

The  following  conclusion  can  be  made:  the  analytical  wall-functions  provide  less  mesh 

dependent  solution  than  the  standard  wall-functions.  Nevertheless,  the  analytical  wall-

functions  are  highly  sensitive  to  the  sub-layer  thickness  yv  and  the  dependence  on  mesh  is 

relatively high. In the case of a fine mesh, both wall-function approaches fail and some extra 

damping terms are necessary [3]. As an alternative, the different interpretation of relation (6) 

is suggested in the next section.  

 

3.3. Robin-type treatment of wall functions 

From (6), we have  

Excluding τw from (6) by (7), we obtain: 

                                                 µdu/dy = τw + C y                                                 (7)

It is important to emphasize that relations (8) are accurate for under the assumption that one 
neglects the (cid:147)convective(cid:148) term yndu/dy. If we know u0 from the boundary conditions, we can 

consider equalities (8) as Robin-type boundary conditions for the HR model  at any point y = 
y* > 0. It is reasonable to choose y* outside the sub-layer. On the other hand, y* cannot be too 

far  from  0  since  relations  (8)  are  valid  only  near  the  wall.  Then,  we  can  consider  (8)  as  a 

boundary condition at the wall. 

If we move these equalities to the boundary, we get a Robin-type boundary condition 

at the wall. This boundary condition is similar to the (cid:147)slip boundary condition(cid:148) at the edge of 

the Knudsen-layer in aerodynamics. 

Solving the HR equation with the boundary condition (8), τw satisfies:

where α = 1 (cid:150) y* is a scaling coefficient because of moving the boundary condition from point  
y* to the wall. It provides some minor correction only if y* is big enough.   

The wall-function (8) does  not depend  on the mesh used. There is some dependence 
on  yv  and  y* but it is weaker. The calculation results for different values of the parameters yv 
and y* are given in Table 3. It is important that the parameter y* is not related to the mesh used 

at  all.  Therefore,  any  arbitrary  mesh  can  be  used  in  calculations  including  the  near-wall

The comparison between the exact LR solution, solutions for different values of y* and 
the HR solution with the Dirichlet boundary condition (2) is given in Figure 4 (yv = 3 δε). If y* 

= 0.1, outside of the sub-layer the solution almost coincides with the LR solution.

It is possible  to  set the boundary condition at  point  y* (or nearest mesh point) in the 

computational domain. In this case, the boundary-value problem is numerically solved in the 
domain  y*  <  y  <  1.  In  the  rest  of  the  domain,  0  <  y  <  y*,  the  solution  can  be  obtained 

analytically,  and  it  will  be  considered  in  the  next  section  in  detail.  With  this  approach,  the 
solution  almost  does  not  depend  on  y*  provided  y*  is  considered  outside  the  sub-layer.  It  is 

very close to the ultimate solution when the boundary condition is determined at the wall and 
y* ≈ yv.

3.4 Generalized wall-functions 

In this section, we develop wall-functions in a general case without any approximation of the 

coefficient (cid:181). It is assumed that the convective term can be neglected in some vicinity of the

Equality (14) is accurate for any arbitrary integrable function µ under the assumption that the 

convective term is negligible. Considering (14) as the Robin type boundary condition at either

where ξ = yv/y*. Relations (8) are shown as a particular case. 

In both cases explicit boundary conditions are obtained.  

 

In  a  general  case,  if  integrals  (15)  based  on  the  exact  value  of  µ  are  estimated 

numerically,  it  is  possible  to  develop  the  boundary  condition  of  a  general  type  for  any 
arbitrary integrable function µ.  

As in the previous section, the boundary condition does not depend on a mesh. There 
is some dependence on y* only, although it is not too significant. To decrease the dependence 
on y*, one may assume that  

The results of the computations of τw at different values of y* are given in Table 4.  

µ* = µe ≈ 1/Re                                                        (16)

Correction (16) is essential only for small enough values. Such values are unrealistic 
since  y*  is  to  be  chosen  close  to  the  fully  (cid:147)turbulent(cid:148)  layer  (µ  ≈  µe),  if  considering  the  real 
coefficient µ.  

Comparison with the exact solution (solid line) is done in Figure 5 for y* = 2ε.  The 
dashed and dashed-dotted lines correspond to the boundary condition determined at y* in Ω; 

the line with little squares is the version with the boundary condition at the wall. In the former 

case the solution consists of two parts and very close to the exact solution. The reason for the 

difference  from  the  exact  solution  in  the  latter  case  is  as  follows.  When  the  boundary 

condition is set at the wall, the convective term becomes smaller and its decay influences the 

solution substantially. The lack of accuracy in the composite solution based on the analytical 

expressions (7) and (8) (Fig. 4) is explained by the approximation of µ.

3.4.1 Newman problem 

Once  the  Newman  problem  is  solved,  the  algorithm  is  similar,  but  with  the  following 
modifications. The boundary condition at some point y* is made using (7):

Then, the boundary-value problem is solved either for 0 ≤  y ≤ 1 or  y* ≤  y ≤  1. The value of 

u(0) at the wall for the initial problem can be determined either from (8) or from (14) upon 
obtaining u(y*) and du/dy(y*).  

3.5 Numerical wall-functions and decomposition method  
 
In this section we develop a numerical algorithm for solving equations in the LR models. It 

can also be considered as deriving (cid:147)exact(cid:148) wall-functions. We use this method for the model 

equation but it can be easily generalized to an arbitrary linear equation or system of equations 

under quite general assumptions. The main idea of the approach is as follows. 

 
Near the wall in the domain Ω1 = [0  y*], the following two boundary-value problems is 

1.  Lu1 = f       u1(0) = u0, du1/dy (y* ) = 0              0 ≤  y ≤  y*                                       (18) 

      2.   Lu2 = 0      u2(0) = 0,   du2/dy(y*) = 1               0 ≤  y ≤  y*                                       (19)

It is easy to prove that the general solution is  

            u(y) = u1(y) + du/dy(y*)u2(y)                                        (20) 

If  we  consider  (20)  at  point  y*,  we  have  a  Robin-type  boundary  condition  for  the  rest 

    

domain Ω2: y* ≤ y ≤ 1: 

 u(y*) = u1(y*) + du/dy(y*) u2(y*)                                   (21) 

 
This boundary condition is exact if we set it at y = y*. If the (cid:147)convective(cid:148) term is neglected 

in the first problem, equality (21) exactly coincides with (14).  

If we use the exact coefficient  µ in the domain Ω2, we obtain the exact solution. In this 

case, we have some version of a decomposition method.  

If  we  use  the  HR  model  in  the  domain  Ω2  and  define  the  boundary  condition  at  y*,  the 

error  is  small,  and  the  curves  almost  coincide.  The  difference  is  shown  in  Figure  6,  using 

zoom:

                                                solution after decomposition. 
 
 

 

In this case y* = 2ε, τw= 0.18. If the boundary condition to the wall is solved, we have: τw= 
0.16 if y* = ε; τw= 0.19 if y* = 2ε, and τw= 0.21 if y* = 3ε.  

The comparison of profiles is given in Figure 7:

                                                   for different y*.  
 
If adopting this approach as a decomposition method to solve the LR equations, we have to 

solve two problems near the wall. On the other hand, we can easy optimize a mesh because 
the meshes in the domains Ω1 and Ω2 can be constructed completely independently.  

 
3.5.1. Newman problem 
 
In  this  case  the  algorithm  is  similar  to  the  Dirichlet  problem.  We  solve  the  following  two 

boundary-value problems: 

1.  Lu1 = f    du1dy(0) = u0,      u1(y* ) = 0                                                                      (22) 

 
      2.   Lu2 = 0   du2/dy(0) = 0,       u2(y*) = 1                                                                       (23) 
 
 
 

The general solution is 

            u(y) = u1(y) + u(y* )u2(y)                                                       (24) 

 
  After derivation, a Robin-type boundary condition at y* is solved: 
 

            du/dy(y*) = du1/dy(y*) + u(y*)du2/dy(y*)                                           (25) 

 
We use this boundary condition in the domain Ω2 (y* ≤  y  ≤ 1), and in the domain Ω\Ω2 the 
solution is obtained from (24), upon u(y* ) is known from the previous problem.  

 

  

 

 

4.  Conclusion 

For  a  model  equation  simulating  LR  models,  different  wall-functions  have  been  studied 

and derived. Our study has revealed that although the analytical wall-functions are less mesh-

dependent  than  the  standard  wall-functions,  some  substantial  mesh  sensitivity  does  remain, 

especially on a fine mesh.  

A new Robin-type interpretation of the wall-functions has been suggested. The boundary 

conditions (wall-functions) are mesh-independent in this case. There is some dependence on 

one  or  two  free  parameters  (including  the  sub-layer  thickness)  but  it  is  weak  provided  the 

parameters are reasonably estimated.  

New analytical and numerical wall-functions of a general type have been derived. In the 
former case they are valid for any efficient (cid:147)turbulence coefficient(cid:148) µ. In the latter case, the 

wall-functions can be treated as (cid:147)exact(cid:148) boundary conditions. The algorithm developed can be 

considered as a decomposition method and allows us to split the problem into a near-wall part 

and  the  rest  one.  Since  the  algorithm  is  exact,  one  can  use  it  for  effective  solving  the  low-

Reynolds-number equations directly.  

Although the theory has been developed for a model equation, it can be used for solving 

the (cid:147)real(cid:148) LR equations including the major algorithms and formulas derived. In that case, the 

decomposition method is to be included into non-linear iterations. The integrals in (15) can be 

estimated  from  a  previous  iteration  or  time  step.  There  is  a  room  for  optimization,  e.g.,  the 

boundary-value problem (18) for the uniform equation can be solved once.

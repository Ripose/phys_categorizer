Abstract  :  The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  analyse  the  influence  of  the  mechanical

characteristics of the set of components on the critical rotational speeds of a gearbox. The

case  of  a  gearbox  fitted  out  with  a  helical  gear  pair  was  considered.  The  shafts  and  the

casing were discretised using the finite element method. The elastic coupling between the

toothed  wheels  was  characterised  by  a  12  x12  stiffness  matrix.  The  bearings  were

modelled  using  radial,  axial  and  rotational  stiffness  elements.  The  calculation  of  the

vibration  response  induced  by  the  static  transmission  error  showed  that  the  highest

dynamic  mesh  forces  correspond  to  a  resonant  excitation  of  modes  which  have  a  high

potential energy associated with the mesh stiffness. The numerical simulations performed

showed that a realistic prediction of  the critical rotational speeds should take account of all

the components of the gearbox.

1- INTRODUCTION

In the course of designing a geared system, it is important to be able to predict those

rotational  speeds  which  will  lead  to  the  highest  dynamic  mesh  forces  and  to  the  highest

vibrational  and  acoustic  levels.  These  speeds  are  associated  with  resonant  excitation

phenomena  (conventional  or  parametric  resonance)  of  certain  natural  modes  of  the

gearbox.

There are many sources of vibrational excitation for a geared system [1, 2, 3, 4]. For a

gearbox operating at a constant average speed, the excitations and, in particular, the static

transmission error, are periodical functions. As it is possible to fix the operating speed of a

gearbox  over  a  wide  range  of  speeds,  each  of  the  harmonic  components  of  the  static

transmission error has the capacity to excite a mode of the gearbox in a resonant manner.

The excitation of some modes leads to strong amplifications of the mesh force. This type

of phenomenon has been brought to light by experimental investigations [5] and by using

simplified  models  [6].  The  object  of  our  study  is  to  introduce  a  more  complete  dynamic

model with a view to indicating the influence of each of the mechanical components of a

gearbox on the localisation of critical rotational speeds.

2- MODEL OF THE GEARBOX

Table1. Gear characteristics.

The  shafts  and  the  casing  of  the  gearbox  were  discretised  using  a  finite  element

method. The shafts were modelled using beam elements with two nodes and 6 degrees of

freedom for each node (see Figure 1).

Each  toothed  wheel  was  modelled  with

concentrated  mass  elements  and  rotary

inertias at three nodes along the shaft.

The contact zone between the teeth was

modelled  using  a  symmetrical  12x12

stiffness matrix which couples the 6 degrees

of  freedom  of  the  driven  wheel  with  the  6

degrees  of  freedom  of  the  driving  wheel.

This  matrix  is  defined  from  the  geometrical

characteristics  of  the  gear  and  from  the

mesh  stiffness,  according  to  the  method

described in [5].

Figure 1. Model of the shafts.

The  input  and  output  inertias  corresponding  to  the  motor  and  the  load  are  equal  to

1 kg.m². They are connected to the shafts through torsion stiffness elements which model

the elasticity of the couplings utilised to connect the motor and the load to the gearbox.

The elastic coupling induced by the rolling element bearings between the shafts and the

casing  is  complex.  On  the  one  hand,  their  stiffnesses  are  non-linear  functions  of  the

transmitted load. On the other hand, they induce elastic couplings between 5 degrees of

freedom  of  the  shaft  and  5  degrees  of  freedom  of  the  casing  [7].  Each  bearing  can  be

modelled  with  a  10x10  stiffness  matrix,  after  linearising  each  term  around  the  static

equilibrium  position.  In  this  study,  we  supposed  that  the  coupling  terms  were  negligible.

For  each  of  the  four  identical  bearings  in  the  gearbox,  we  introduced  one  axial  stiffness,

the rotation of the free sections along the shafts to the box (rotational stiffnesses).

The  steel  casing  is  a  450x280x160  mm

parallelepiped which is 10 mm thick. it was

modelled  using  shell  elements  and  three-

dimensional  structural  solids  to  represent

the bearing housings (see Figure 2).

The  elastic  model  of  the  whole  gearbox

has  approximately  1000  elements  and

7000 degrees of freedom.

Figure 2. Model of the casing.

3- COMPUTATION OF THE VIBRATORY RESPONSE

In studying the forced vibrations of the gearbox, we supposed that the only excitation is

the static transmission error [2]. The main contributions to this error are the fluctuation of

the  mesh  stiffness  and  the  geometry  faults  of  the  gear  pair  [1,  8,  9].  In  the  stationary

regime, they induce a periodical excitation. The matrix equation which governs vibrations

of the discretized gearbox can be written as follows :

Mx + Kx + k(t)Dx = F + E(t)

(1)

In this equation, M and K are the classical mass and stiffness matrices provided by the

finite element method and F is the classical external force vector. Matrix D is derived from

the geometric characteristics of the gear pair,  E is an equivalent force vector induced  by

the unloaded static transmission error and k(t) is the periodic mesh stiffness. In the modal

base  defined  from  the  time-invariant  homogeneous  counterpart  equation  and  by

introducing a viscous modal damping, the matrix equation (1) can be changed into :

mq + cq + kq + g(t)dq = s

(2)

Here, m, c and k are the mass, damping and stiffness diagonal matrices, s is the modal

force vector and g(t).d is a non-diagonal matrix which is induced by the fluctuating part of

the mesh stiffness and which couples the equations of motion. To solve the equation (2),

we  used  the  Spectral  Iterative  Method  described  in  [5].  This  method  provides  a  direct

spectral description of the vibratory response at every degree of freedom.

The  object  of  this  study  is  to  characterise  the  influence  of  different  mechanical

parameters  on  the  modes  which  lead  to  high  dynamic  mesh  force.  We  chose  a  static

transmission error resulting from a harmonic variation of the mesh stiffness. We chose an
average  value  of  the  mesh  stiffness  equal  to  4.108  N/m  and  a  peak  amplitude  of  its
harmonic fluctuation equal to 4.107 N/m. The constant motor torque was equal to 500 Nm.

We chose equivalent viscous damping rates of 3% for each mode.

The  modes  which  have  the  highest  r m  energy  rate  are  called  the  f m  modes.  The

higher r m is, the higher the dynamic mesh load should be.

For each bearing, the r ra energy rates associated with the radial stiffness elements and
the  r ro  energy  rates  associated  with  the  rotational  stiffness  elements  can  similarly  be
defined.

5- INFLUENCE OF SHAFT BENDING

Our first step was to calculate the natural modes of the gearbox for a model which only

takes  into  account  torsion  vibrations  of  shafts,  gear  and  couplings  (see  Figure  3a).  By
analysing the mode shapes, two f m modes with r m energy rates equal to 34% (1531 Hz)
and 61% (3140 Hz) could be detected. Figure 3b displays the evolution of the root mean
square value of the mesh force relative to the mesh frequency. The resonances of the f m
modes generate the highest mesh loads.

We  then  calculated  the  natural  modes  for  the  gearbox  using  a  model  taking  into

account  tension,  compression,  torsion  and  bending  vibrations  of  shafts  and  gear  (see

Figure  4a).  The  casing  and  the  bearings  were  assumed  to  be  rigid.  The  shafts  were
considered to be simply supported. The presence of three f m modes with r m energy rates
equal to 22%, 26% and 27% is noted (1251 Hz, 3056 Hz and 3682 Hz). Unlike the other

modes  of  the  structure,  the  shapes  of  these  modes  simultaneously  offer  bending  and

torsion  vibrations.  This  phenomenon  is  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  gear  couples  the

complete set of degrees of freedom of the driven wheel to the complete set of degrees of

freedom  of  the  driving  wheel.  Figure  4b  displays  the  evolution  of  the  root  mean  square
value  of  the  mesh  force  relative  to  the  mesh  frequency.  The  f m  modes  generate  three
resonances.  The  difference  between  these  results  and  the  previous  ones  shows  a  shaft

bending  effect.  A  torsion  model  does  not  allow  the  appropriate  prediction  of  the  critical

6- INFLUENCE OF THE ROLLING ELEMENT BEARINGS

The  numerical  results  presented  below  were  obtained  from  a  model  which  takes  into

account  not  only  the  tension,  compression,  torsion  and  bending  vibrations  of  shafts  and

gear, but also the elasticity of bearings. The nominal values of the radial (identical in the

two  perpendicular  directions),  axial  and  rotational  stiffnesses  of  the  bearings  were
respectively equal to 109 N/m, 108 N/m and 106 Nm/rad.

Figure 5a supplies the first natural frequencies associated with this new model. The first

and the second natural frequencies of the structure (16 Hz and 95 Hz) correspond to pure

torsion modes. They are  controlled  by  couplings.  The  gearbox  presents  two  axial  modes

(590  Hz  and  605  Hz),  four  bending  modes  (1728  Hz,  2237  Hz,  2898  Hz,  2961  Hz),  and
one torsion mode for the shafts (1768 Hz). The f m modes (1191 Hz, 3365 Hz and 4157
Hz) are not the first modes of the system.

The  figure  5b  displays  the  evolution  of  the  root  mean  square  value  of  the  mesh  force

relative  to  the  mesh  frequency.  The  presence  of  three  resonances  is  noted.  Comparison

with the rigid bearings model shows that the elasticity of the bearings modifies the critical

rotational speeds.

Influence of radial stiffness

In order to analyse in more detail the influence of the rolling element bearings on modes
which lead to a high mesh force, we have varied the radial stiffness within the range 108
N/m  to  1010  N/m.  This  range  corresponds  to  the  usual  values  encountered  in  geared

systems.  By  comparison,  the  average  mesh  stiffness  value  for  the  gearbox  studied  is  4
108 N/m.

Figure 6 displays the map of the root mean square value of the mesh force relative to

radial stiffnesses of bearings and mesh frequency. For the gearbox studied and within the
considered  stiffness  variation  range  (108  N/m  to  1010  N/m),  we  observed  the  following

characteristics :
1-  The  frequencies  of  the  f m  modes  change  with  the  radial  stiffnesses  of  the  bearings.
This evolution appears for radial stiffnesses which are all the greater when the frequency
of  the  f m  mode  is  high.  It  depends  on  the  modal  potential  energy  associated  with  the
radial stiffness elements, that is the r ra energy rates of the f m modes. Thus:
-  For  the  first  f m  modes  (frequency  lower  than  2000  Hz),  the  r ra  energy  rates  are  high
between  108  and  109  N/m  and  then  lower  from  109  N/m.  So,  the  evolution  of  the
frequencies of the f m modes is high between 108 and 109 N/m, and then weak from 109
N/m.
-  For  the  f m  modes  situated  at  higher  frequencies  (frequency  over  2000  Hz),  the  r ra
energy rates are nil between 108 and 109 N/m and increase from 109 N/m. The evolution
of the frequencies of the f m modes is initially fairly weak between 108 and 109 N/m, and
then more obvious from 109 N/m.
2- The evolution of the frequency of the f m modes is accompanied by a modification of the
mode  shape  so  that  the  r m  energy  rates  of  the  f m  modes,  that  is  the  potential  energy
associated with the mesh stiffness, decrease.
3- The resonances of the f m modes (1676 Hz, 3349 Hz and 4139 Hz for K=108 N/m), in
the  end  disappear  to  the  benefit  of  the  onset  of  new  f m'  modes  situated  at  lower
frequencies  (respectively  1364  Hz,  3311  Hz  and  4053  Hz  for  K=  1010  N/m).  This

behaviour leads to lower critical rotational speeds when the radial stiffnesses are greater.

Influence of rotational stiffness

We  also  varied  the  rotational  stiffness  of  the  bearings  between  104 Nm/rad  and
108 Nm/rad.  This  range  enables  the  study  of  the  influence  of  the  different  types  of

bearings  :  ball-type  bearings  (low  rotational  stiffness),  cylindrical  roller-type  bearings

(average rotational stiffness) and taper roller-type bearings (high rotational stiffness).

Figure 7 displays the map of the root mean square value of the mesh force relative to
rotational stiffnesses of bearings and mesh frequency. The frequencies of the f m modes

change  with  the  rotational  stiffness  of  the  bearings.  The  evolution  of  these  frequencies
depends on the r ro energy rates associated with the rotational stiffness elements. The r ro
energy rates are high between 106 and 107 Nm/rad. So, the evolution of the frequencies
of the f m modes is high between 106 and 107 Nm/rad. The resonances of the f m modes
(respectively 1110 Hz, 3100 Hz and 3914 Hz for K=104 Nm/rad) disappear to the benefit
of the onset of new f m' modes (respectively 1259 Hz and 3459 Hz for K=108 Nm/rad).

7- INFLUENCE OF THE CASING

In order to assess the influence of the mechanical  properties  (elasticity  and  inertia)  of

the  casing  on  the  critical  rotational  speeds  of  the  gearbox,  a  modal  analysis  of  the

complete  gearbox  was  carried  out.  The  model  takes  account  of  the  whole  set  of

components  of  the  gearbox,  that  is  to  say  the  gear,  the  shafts,  the  bearings,  the  casing,

the  couplings  and  the  input  and  output  inertias.  For  this  new  study,  we  chose  radial
stiffnesses  of  bearings  equal  to  109  N/m  and  rotational  stiffnesses  equal  to  106  Nm/rad.

Figure 8 supplies the first natural frequencies of the new model.

A detailed examination of the new modes enabled us to conclude that :

- Within the considered frequency range, the f m modes are numerous but the r m energy
rate in each is fairly low.

- The  vibrations  of  the  shafts  are  coupled  with  the  vibrations  of  the  casing.  The  dynamic

behaviour of the casing thus interacts with the gear set.
- Because of vibrations of the casing, the frequency and the shape of each f m mode are
different from those calculated with a rigid casing.

Figure 8. Natural frequencies of the system. Model including casing elasticity.

We then compared the evolution of the root mean square value of the mesh force with

the  previous  results  (rigid  casing).  This  comparison  is  offered  for  radial  stiffnesses-
rotational  stiffnesses  of  bearings  respectively  equal  to  108  N/m-104  Nm/rad  (Figure  9a),
109 N/m-106 Nm/rad (Figure 9b) and 1010 N/m-108 Nm/rad (Figure 9c).

As displayed in Figure 9a, the mechanical properties  of  the  casing  do  not  change  the
f m modes for radial stiffnesses equal to 108 N/m and rotational stiffnesses equal to 104
Nm/rad.  In  point  of  fact,  the  casing  vibrations  are  not  coupled  with  those  of  the  gear.

Conversely, for higher bearing stiffnesses, the dynamic behaviour of the gear is then highly

affected  by  the  elastic  properties  of  the  casing.  As  illustrated  in  Figures  9b  and  9c,  the

resonances  are  more  numerous.  The  frequencies  of  these  resonances  have  changed

appreciably and the maximum level of the mesh force has dropped.

Parametric  studies  have  shown  that  rotational  stiffnesses  play  a  more  significant  role

than the radial stiffnesses of the coupling between the casing and the gear set.

8- INFLUENCE OF THE TORSION STIFFNESS OF THE FLEXIBLE COUPLINGS

We have connected the torsion stiffness of the coupling and the torsion stiffness of the

adjacent half-shaft in series. The figures 10a and 10b show that, for a low torsion stiffness

of  the  coupling,  the  equivalent  stiffness  of  the  coupling+shaft  set  is  comparable  to  the

stiffness of the coupling. For a torsion stiffness of the coupling which is greater than that of

the shaft, the torsion stiffness of the coupling+shaft set converges towards the stiffness of

the shaft.

The  evolution  of  the  torsion  stiffness  of  the  coupling+shaft  set  is  significantly  different

according  to  whether  the  shafts  are  long  (and  thus  flexible)  or  short  (and  thus  stiff).  For

160 mm-long shafts, the coupling+shaft set has a stiffness which constantly remains below

the  torsion  stiffness  of  the  gear  set.  For  80-mm  long  shafts,  the  sitffness  of  the

coupling+shaft set is initially below the torsion stiffness of the gear set. It becomes equal to

and then greater than this stiffness when the torsion stiffness of the couplings increases.

Torsion stiffness of the coupling+shaft set versus torsion stiffness of the coupling.

Figures  11  and  12  display  the  evolution  of  the  root  mean  square  value  of  the  mesh
force  for  a  flexible  coupling  (104  Nm/rad)  and  a  stiff  coupling  (108  Nm/rad).  The  model

used is the model where the gearbox casing is rigid.

For  long  shafts,  we  see  that  a  variation  of  the  stiffness  of  the  couplings  only  modifies
the first torsion modes of the gearbox. The f m modes (3350 Hz and 4155 Hz) are identical
for  flexible  couplings  and  stiff  couplings.  Any  variation  of  the  torsion  stiffness  of  the

couplings thus has no appreciable influence on the critical rotational speeds.

For short shafts, the frequency of the f m modes is equal to 1388 Hz and 2717 Hz when
the  torsion  stiffness  of  the  couplings  is  low  (104  Nm/rad)  and  it  is  equal  to  208  Hz  and
3427 Hz  when  the  torsion  stiffness  of  the  couplings  is  greater  (108  Nm/rad).  These

differences translate the appreciable influence of the torsion stiffness of the couplings on
the  dynamic  behaviour  of  the  gearbox.  In  point  of  fact,  the  frequency  of  the  f m  modes
increased with the stiffness of the couplings (from 1388 to 2084 Hz and from 2717 to 3427

Hz) while the amplitude of the resonance decreased. New f m' modes appeared at lower
frequencies (208 Hz and 661 Hz).

For  a  coupling  stiffness  equal  to  104  Nm/rad,  the  motor  and  the  load  correspond  to
vibration nodes of the f m modes. They are totally disconnected from the gear set by the
distortion of the couplings. For a stiffness equal to 108 Nm/rad, the first f m mode (208 Hz)
corresponds  to  the  first  mode  of  the  gearbox.  This  mode  is  dominated  by  torsion

vibrations.  The  shafts,  the  couplings,  the  motor  and  the  load  move  as  rigid  bodies.  The

gear  set  being  the  most  flexible  torsion  element,  this  alone  is  distorted.  For  short  shafts
and stiff couplings, a f m mode with a low frequency, which is related  to  the  presence  of
high input and output inertias, thus appears.

9- CONCLUSION

the finite element method.

To study the dynamic behaviour of a helical gearbox we modelled its components using

We defined a method enabling the identification of the f m modes which can be excited

by the static transmission error, based on a modal analysis of the gearbox.

We  showed  that  these  f m  modes  generated  the  highest  dynamic  mesh  forces  and

consequently the strongest vibration levels of the casing.

We showed the influence of bending along the shafts, of the elasticity of the bearings,

of the mechanical properties of the casing and of the torsion stiffnesses of the couplings

on the critical rotational speeds of the gearbox.

We can thus conclude that the critical rotational speeds for a geared system can only

be realistically predicted by a global model including the shafts, the bearings, the casing,

the couplings and the input and output inertias.

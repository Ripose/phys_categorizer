Abstract.  Multiple  scattering  of  radio  waves  by  artificial  random  irregularities  HF-induced  in  the 
ionosphere F region may cause significant attenuation of both ordinary and extraordinary waves together with 
common anomalous absorption of ordinary waves due to their non-linear conversion into plasma waves. To 
demonstrate existence and strength of this effect, direct measurements of attenuation of both powerful pump 
wave  and  weak  probing  waves  of  extraordinary  polarization  have  been  carried  out  during  an  experimental 
campaign  on  September  6,  7  and  9,  1999  at  the  Sura  heating  facility.  The  attenuation  magnitude  of 
extraordinary waves reaches of 1–10 dB over a background attenuation caused by natural irregularities. It is 
interpreted  in  the  paper  on  the  base  of  the  theory  of  multiple  scattering  from  the  artificial  random 
irregularities with characteristic scale lengths of 0.1–1 km. Simple procedure for determining of irregularity 
spectrum parameters from the measured attenuation of extraordinary waves has been implemented and some 
conclusions about the artificial irregularity formation have been obtained. 

 

 Introduction 

Attenuation  of  radio  waves  reflected  in  the  heated  volume  of  the  ionosphere  is  observed  in 

ionospheric modification  experiments since early 1970's  [Allen et al., 1974; Belikovich et al., 1975; 

Berezin  et al., 1987; Frolov et al., 1997]. Main attention was  given  to  anomalous attenuation of the 

ordinary  wave,  known  also  as  'anomalous  absorption'  (AA).  The  AA  is  based  on  the  well  known 

mechanism of ordinary wave conversion into the upper hybrid plasma waves via scattering from small-

scale (1-50 m) irregularities. The theory of this mechanism has been well developed (see, for example, 

statement of classical approaches in [Vas'kov and Gurevich, 1975; Grach et al., 1978; Das and Fejer, 

1979; Robinson, 1989] and some new results in [Bronin et al., 1999]).  

Effect  of  anomalous  attenuation  for  extraordinary  wave  have  been  studied  rather  poorly  in 

comparison with ordinary wave. It was expected that it is negligible in most cases since the conversion 

mechanism  does  not  work  for  extraordinary  waves  in  the  ionosphere.  However,  there  are  some 

experimental results showing that anomalous attenuation for the extraordinary wave may reach values 

comparable  with  the  ordinary  wave  AA  (see,  for  example,  [Erukhimov  et  al,  1980]).  Below  in  the 

paper we will discuss experimental data obtained during purposeful experimental campaign at the Sura 

heating facility (Vasil'sursk, Russia) performed in September, 1999, which have clearly demonstrated 

permanent existence of the anomalous attenuation for both pump and probing extraordinary waves. 

 

2 

The  only  actual  mechanism  of  the  anomalous  attenuation  of  the  extraordinary  wave  is  the 

small-angle  multiple  scattering  from  intermediate-scale (transversal with relation to the geomagnetic 

field scale length  l⊥ ~ 0.1-1 km) electron density irregularities. As it has been recently established (see 

[Zabotin  et  al,  1998]  and  references  therein),  multiple  scattering  under  conditions  of  strong 

ionospheric  refraction  results  in  the  spatial  redistribution  of  radiation  reflected  from  the  ionosphere 

with  considerable  decrease  in  its  intensity  in  a  vicinity  of  the  sounding  station  as  compared  with 

radiation  distribution  in  absence  of  the  irregularities.  This  attenuation,  perceived  by  a  ground-based 

observer as anomalous (non-collisional) attenuation of both ordinary and extraordinary waves, may be 

so large as 10 dB or more.  

Thus,  when  intermediate-scale  and  small-scale  irregularities  are  developed  together,  multiple 

scattering may cause the attenuation of extraordinary wave and contribute into the attenuation of the 

ordinary  wave  together  with  'anomalous  absorption'.  The  purpose  of  the  present  paper  is to study in 

detail the role of the attenuation of extraordinary waves due to scattering mechanism and demonstrate 

possibility  to  use  such  X-mode  probing  for  diagnostics  of  artificial  irregularities  in  the  ionospheric 

plasma. 

2. Theoretical grounds for anomalous attenuation effect 

The  AA  of  the  ordinary  wave  is  closely  connected  with  generation  of  artificial  small-scale 
( l⊥ < 50  m  [Frolov  et  al.,  1997])  irregularities.  These  irregularities  are  produced  in  plasma  by  the 

thermal parametric instability of the powerful ordinary wave [Vas'kov and Gurevich, 1975; Grach et 

al., 1977; Das and Fejer, 1979]. Conversion of the pump wave into the upper-hybrid plasma waves is 

accompanied  by  growth  of  the  irregularity  amplitude  what  results  in  fast  development  of  the  AA 

phenomenon (several seconds after the pump wave is turned on). When they aroused, the small-scale 

irregularities  are  equally  able  to  influence  both  powerful  pump  wave  (PW)  and  probing  wave 

amplitudes.  For  a  known  spatial  spectrum  of  artificial  irregularities  the  AA  value  may  be  most 

conveniently estimated using the conversion cross-section [Bronin et al., 1999a].  

The AA affects only the ordinary wave because extraordinary one is reflected below the upper-

hybrid  coupling  region.  On  the  contrary,  the  usual  (without  the  conversion)  scattering  from  the 

intermediate-scale irregularities is able to affect both O- and X-mode waves. It  should be noted that 

such  irregularities  are  often  present  under  natural  ionospheric  conditions  [see,  e.g.,  Szuszczciewicz, 

1987]. They are also generated in heating experiments due to, for example, the self-focusing instability 

of  the  PW  [Vas'kov  and  Gurevich,  1976].  Correspondingly,  measurements  of  the  radio  wave 

attenuation  in  the  undisturbed  ionosphere  [Setty et al., 1971; Vodolazkin et al., 1983; Bronin  et al., 

1999b] demonstrate existence of the anomalous attenuation which cannot be explained by collisional 
losses  of  the  radio  waves.  Note  that  small-scale  irregularities  ( l⊥ <   50  m)  are  suppressed  in  the 

 

3 

undisturbed  ionosphere  what  manifests  itself  in  power-law  behavior  (with  negative  index)  of  the 

natural irregularity spatial spectrum [Szuszczciewicz, 1987], so the mode conversion mechanism also 

cannot  explain  significant  attenuation  of the sounding signal.  Only  common multiple  scattering may 

provide the observed magnitude of the anomalous attenuation of radio waves in the natural ionosphere.  

Theoretical description of the vertical sounding signal multiple scattering from the ionospheric 

irregularities is a fairly complex task. In a general case it is necessary to take into account the regular 

refraction and the hyrotropy of the medium. If the intensity of the reflected signal is of interest only, 

the task may be solved by means of the radiative transfer theory [Bronin and Zabonin, 1992; Zabotin, 

1993;  Zabotin  et  al.,  1998;  Bronin  et  al.,  1999c].  For  the  model  of  the  randomly  irregular  plane 

ionospheric  layer  this  approach  allows  one  to  obtain  an  approximate  solution  in  analytical  form. 
According to [Zabotin et al., 1998] the energy flux at a point with coordinate  ρ(cid:71)

 on the Earth's surface 

may be written as:

According  to  expressions  (1)  and  (2),  an  observer  situated  at  the  point  ρ(cid:71)

effects caused by the multiple scattering: the change of arrival angles and the decrease or increase in 

the intensity of the received wave after its reflection from the ionosphere. For the vertical sounding of

of 10 dB or more [Zabotin et al., 1998]. 

Expression (1), together with parameters of the ionospheric layer (electron density profile, etc.) 

and parameters of the spatial spectrum of irregularities specified, forms the quantitative model of the 

anomalous  attenuation.  This  model  can  be  used  to  solve  the  inverse  problem  of  the  irregularity 

diagnostics:  the  spectrum  parameters  are  determined  by  fitting  the  experimental  data  in  spirit  of  the 

least  squares  method.  Using  the  extraordinary  wave attenuation measurements  one  may  estimate the 

parameters  of  the  intermediate-scale  irregularity  spectrum,  then  separate  contributions  from  the 

multiple  scattering  and  from  the  mode  conversion  mechanism  into  the  anomalous  attenuation of the 

ordinary wave and finally determine the spectrum properties for the small-scale irregularities.

Full  implementation  of  this  plan,  however,  requires  extended  experimental  data  set  that 

currently  cannot  be  provided  by  the  experimental  facility  being  at  our  disposal.  For  example, 

simultaneous  measurements  of  attenuation  of  the  ordinary  and  extraordinary  waves  using  close 

frequency grid are desirable but not carried out now. It would be nice also to know the absolute value 

of the attenuation what means, in particular, that the "background" attenuation, presumably caused by 

the  natural  irregularities  should  be  determined  before  heating  of  the  ionospheric  plasma.  Present 

technique  used  for  the  anomalous  attenuation  observations  is  based  on  the  relative  measurement 

However, it will be shown below that valuable results may be derived from experimental data

obtained with the available technique. 

2. Experimental results 

The experiments with the Sura heating facility were carried out on  September 6, 7 and 9, 1999 

in the evening or night hours when collisional absorption in the ionosphere D and E regions could be 

considered  negligible.  Heating  was  provided  by  coherent  work  of  three  250  kW  transmitters.  With 

account  of the antenna  gain  the effective radiated power (ERP) was 150-250 MW depending on the 

PW  frequency  (150  MW  ERP  for  5.75  MHz  and  250  MW  ERP  for  7.8  MHz).  In  the  September  9 

session  the  heater  power  was  varied  but  we  use  for  the  purposes  of  our  present  work  only  data  of 

homogeneous  subset  of  the  heating  cycles  corresponding  to  150  MW  ERP.  The  duration  of  each 

heating  cycle  on  September  6  and  7  was  15  minutes  including  the  active  phase  of  5  minutes  length 

(heater on) and off-time of 10 minutes. On September 9 another scheme was used: 3 min on — 7 min 

off.  Overall  duration  of  the  measurement  series  included  into  processing  was  3.9  hours  (15  heating 

cycles) in the first case, 3 hours (12 heating cycles) in the second case, and 4h50m in the third case (12 

heating cycles). In the experiment on September 6 the heating was performed by the high-power HF 

wave of ordinary polarization at the pump frequency 5,752 MHz. Amplitudes of probing waves were 

simultaneously recorded at 7 frequencies: 4.069, 4.669, 5.669, 6.069, 6.269, 6.424 and 6.849  MHz. In 

the  experiment  on  September  7  the  extraordinary  PW  at  the  frequency  7.815  MHz  was  used. 

Simultaneous  amplitude  measurements  were  carried  out  with  6  probing  waves  at  the  following 

frequencies: 5.424, 6.624, 7.224, 7.624, 7.789 and 8.024 MHz. On  September 9 the used frequencies 

were: 5.752 MHz for the PW and 4.469, 4.969, 5.369, 5.569, 5.769, 5.969, 6.169 MHz for the probing 

waves. A 'Katran' receiver (with pass band of 4 kHz) was used for registering of the PW amplitude and 

'Brusnika'  receivers  (with  pass  band  of  1  kHz)  were  used  for  registering  of  the  probing  wave 

amplitudes.  In  all  series  only  probing  waves  of  extraordinary  polarization  were  used.  The  probing 

wave  transmitter  emitted  pulse  signals  of  the  linear polarization with duration of 100 microseconds. 

After  reflection  from  the  ionospheric  layer  these  signals  were  received  by  the  antenna  of  the 

extraordinary polarization with 15 dB suppression of the ordinary component.

During the heating experiment the electron density profile was controlled by both vertical and 

oblique radio sounding.  According to these data, the F2 layer critical frequencies exceeded as a rule 

both PW frequency and probing wave ones. The only exclusion took place at the end of the September 

7  series,  so  the  data  from  3  last  cycles  (7  cycles  for  the  top  frequency  probing  wave)  were  to  be 

excluded from the processing. 

An example of the initial data (records of the amplitude for a probing wave and the PW for the 

September  6  session)  is  shown  in  Figure  1.  Interval  between  the  data  points  is  0.2  sec.  The  effect 

constituting the subject of this paper manifests itself distinctly already in data of such kind: It is seen 

that  periods  of  the  heater  turn-on  are  accompanied  by  significant  drop  of  the  extraordinary  probing 

wave  amplitude.  To  determine  the  details  of  this  process  it  is  necessary  to  weaken  the  natural 

variability  of  the  signal.  It  is  achieved  by  averaging  of  the  original  data  over  a  number  of  heating 

cycles during the same experimental session. Instants of switching the pump wave on (off) serve as the 

temporal  reference  points  for  this  procedure.  The  result  of  such  averaging  for  experimental  data 

obtained on September 6, 7 and 9 is shown in Figures 2-4 respectively.  

Four  successive  stages  of  the  probing  signal  evolution  can  be  discriminated  within  a  heating 

cycle. The first stage, immediately preceding the heater turn-on, is characterized by random variations 

of  the  signal  amplitude  near  some  median  value 

offA .  Right  away  the  PW  turn-on  the  transitional 

stage follows during which the mean signal amplitude decreases gradually to smaller value  onA . This 

is the development stage of the anomalous attenuation effect. The next stage lasts till the PW turn-off. 

It is characterized by random amplitude variations near the  onA . After the PW turn-off the relaxation 

stage occurs during which the ionosphere restores its natural undisturbed state and the signal amplitude 

increases gradually to the initial median value  offA . Note that in a varying degree these features of the 

probing  signal  behavior  are  characteristic  of  all  used  frequencies  for  all  three  observation  days. 

Features of the reflected PW amplitude are also of interest. There is nothing special in the attenuation 

of the ordinary PW for the data obtained on September 6: This effect is attributed mainly to the mode 

conversion  mechanism  and  is  well  studied  before  [Belikovich  et  al.,1975;  Robinson,  1989].  In  the 

present case the attenuation was about 11 dB and development time for this effect was of order of one 

second, in accordance with classical notions about the thermal parametric instability. But anomalous 

attenuation  of  a  significant  magnitude  occurs  also  for  the  extraordinary  PW  used  during  two  other 

observational sessions, on September 7 and 9. It was near 12 dB with development time about 40 sec 

on September 7 and about 4-5 dB with development time near 20 sec on September 9. We can thus 

conclude that such anomalous attenuation of extraordinary waves (both probing and pump) is a quite 

common effect in the heating experiments. 

There  are  some  additional  common  points  of  the  dependencies  presented  in  Figs.  2-4  that in 

fact are not connected with the heating activity. For example, in Fig. 2 near 30, 350 and 380 sec one 

 

6 

can see sharp changes of the probing wave amplitude simultaneous for all used frequencies. This is a 

result of the nearby ionosonde activity which periodicity coincided with the heater cycling. We have 

excluded these time intervals from the data processing. 

We  will  characterize the anomalous attenuation effect by the relative weakening of the wave 

intensity expressed in decibels in the following way:

Results of data processing are presented in Figs. 5-7. Maximal relative attenuation of probing 

waves is about of 9.6 dB, the minimal registered one is about of 1.5 dB (see Fig. 5). All three data sets 

show  common  tendency  of  gradual  decrease  in  the  relative  attenuation  RL   when  the  sounding 

frequency is increased. This distinction of the present results from those presented in [Erukhimov et al, 

1980] is caused evidently by the difference in the PW ERP (20 MW ERP in [Erukhimov et al, 1980] 

and  150-250  MW  ERP  in  our  work).  More  powerful  HF  exposure  leads  to  creation  of  stronger 

irregularities  at  larger  distances  from  the  heating  region.  So  in  this  case  the  anomalous  attenuation 

effect manifests itself stronger at the lower frequencies. 

Two  characteristic  times,  dev

  and 

τ

τ

rel

,  do  not  demonstrate  clear  regular  change  with  the 

frequency  growth.  One  should  notice,  however,  that  maximal  development  time  corresponds  to 

reflection  from  the  heating  region  altitudes  in  each  of  three  sequences.  For  the  most  part,  the 

development  time  values  lie  in  the  interval  2-40  sec  corresponding  nicely  to  known  time  of 

development  of  artificial  intermediate-scale  irregularities  [Frolov  et  al.,  2000;  Frolov  et  al.,  1997]. 

Note,  however,  that  on  September  9  the  dev

τ

  was  steadily  kept  near  the  smallest  values  2-5  sec. 

Values of characteristic times corresponding to three highest frequencies on September 7 are visibly 

aside from the common consistent pattern. It can be explained by closeness of these frequencies to the 

F  layer  critical  frequency  (~7.9  MHz).  This  relates  also  to  the  relaxation  time  values  for  the  same 

frequencies.  Excluding  them  from  consideration  one  can  infer  that  observed  spreading  of  the 

relaxation time values is very small for a given frequency, for all three series they lie in the interval 13-

70 sec. The latter interval overlaps essentially with that one for the development time, though one can 

notice that the 

τ

rel

 

values are as a rule higher than the  dev

τ

 ones. These characteristic times properties 

are explained naturally  on the assumption that the process primarily responsible for both irregularity 

formation and decay out of the heating region is universal: It is the ambipolar diffusion of the electron 

 

7 

density  disturbance  emerged  inside  the  heating  region  along  the  magnetic  field  lines.  But  on  the 

development stage this diffusion is enforced by the thermal pressure of the powerful HF field, whereas 

relaxation takes place when this driving force is switched off. 

There  are  not  any  marked  differences  between  the  considered  effects  caused  by  ordinary  or 

extraordinary  pump  waves.  It  is  connected  probably  with  the  circumstance  that  probing  waves, 

frequencies for which would allow them to reflect inside the heating region, are practically absent in 

this data set. So effects outside of the heating region have been studied here. 

The  observed  attenuation  of  the  extraordinary  waves  (the  probing  waves  in  all  sessions  of 

measurements  as  well  as  the  PW  in  two  observational  days)  is  characterized  by  large  values  (the 

amplitude  drops  by  factor  of  1.5-4).  The  only  known  mechanism  able  to  explain  it  has  been  briefly 

described in the previous section: this is the multiple scattering from irregularities with scale lengths 

0.1-1 km. The relations provided by the theory can be used to determine the irregularity characteristics 

from the anomalous attenuation data. 

 

3. Inverse problem  

The theoretical relations cited in Section 1 may be used to obtain information about the spatial 

spectrum of artificial intermediate-scale irregularities from the anomalous attenuation data. Solving of 

some kind of the inverse problem is required for that.  

Following  to  the  standard  conceptions  [e.g.,  Eruchimov  et  al.,  1987]  we  shall  believe  that 

artificial  irregularities  in  the  scale  length  range  of  interest  are  strongly  elongated  along  the 

geomagnetic field lines and characterize them by the following spatial spectrum:

The  information  available  in  our  data  sets  is  not  sufficient  to  determine  all  these  spectrum 

parameters simultaneously (mainly due to small number of the probing wave frequencies). That is why 

we assign to two of them rather typical predetermined values, 

mL =

10

 km and 

ν =

,  proposing to 

look for dependence of  R

δ  on the altitude. 

Note  that  our  data  on  the  relative  anomalous  attenuation  in  principle  do  not  contain  any 

information on the background level of the attenuation caused by natural ionospheric irregularities. So 

 

8 

we  need  to  predetermine  also  the  model  of  natural  irregularities.  Let  us  suppose  that  natural 

irregularities  are  described  by  the  same  spectrum  (4)  with  the  same  parameters 

10

  km    and 

mL =

ν =

,  and  their  amplitude  (we  shall  denote  it  as  N

δ  
δ   to  distinguish  it  from  the  current  value  R

which is changed under the heating influence) does not depend upon the altitude. In other words, we 

suppose  that  heating  of  the  ionosphere  results  only  in  change  of  the  irregularity  amplitude  altitude 

distribution,  while  the  spectrum  slope  remains  unchanged.  In  this  case  the  quantity  N

δ   is  a  free 

parameter in our calculations.  

The above model of the spectrum is not entirely adequate neither for artificial irregularities nor 

for natural ones. The real spectra are known to demonstrate somewhat different behavior for different 

ranges of scale lengths [Szuszczciewicz, 1987; Erukhimov et al., 1987]. For example, they may have a 

hump  near  0.3-0.5  km  [Erukhimov  et  al.,  1987].  We  do  not  provide  in  this  paper  an  ultimate 

diagnostic  procedure  taking  into  account  numerous  properties  of  real  irregularity  spectra,  electron 

density profile, etc. This Section results are to demonstrate only possibility of such diagnostics. 

The general scheme for calculation of the irregularity amplitude looks as follows (see Fig. 8). 

At first one should determine for each frequency of the probing signal the background attenuation  NL  

corresponding to the given value of  N

 can be solved numerically by a simple (e.g., dichotomy) method . 

We  make  two  simplifications  in  our  calculations.  The  real  profile  of  the  electron  density 

altitude dependence is substituted by the linear profile with the same slope at the reflection point. It is 

possible  owing  to  a  key  role  in  the  multiple  scattering  process  of  the  irregularities  located  near  the 

reflection  level.  Also  the  approximation  of  isotropic  ionospheric  plasma  was  used  in  calculation  of 
quantity  P(cid:4) .  

Dimensionless quantity  N N∆

 depends not only on electron density perturbation  N∆ , but also 

on the mean value  N . The latter often changes significantly in the considered range of altitudes. On 

the other hand, one would expect that rapid ambipolar diffusion along the geomagnetic field lines tries 
to  equalize  just  the  quantity  N∆ ,  if  it  is  generated  inside  the  heated  region  under  influence  of  the 
powerful  high-frequency  field.  Thus  the  quantity  N∆   may  give  more  valuable  physical  information 

namely  for  the  artificial  irregularities.  That  is  why  we  present  the  results  of  the  inverse  problem 
solving in the form of altitude dependencies of  N∆  for different values of  N

δ  (Fig. 9).

Analysis  of  the  Fig.  9  shows  first  of  all  that  artificial  irregularities  are  created  in  the  broad 

altitude range (more than 40 km — the value determined by the used probing wave frequency band) 

which significantly exceeds the heating region vertical dimension (~1-2 km). No doubt that broadening 

of  the  used  frequency  band  would  allow  one  to  detect  artificial  irregularities  also  at  other  altitudes.

Conclusion 

An  important  result  of  the  September  1999  heating  campaign  at  the  Sura  facility  is  clear 

demonstration  of  permanent  occurrence  of  considerable  (1.5-12  dB)  anomalous  attenuation  of  both 

pump and probing extraordinary waves. This attenuation cannot be explained by the mode conversion 

mechanism  when  scattering  from  the  small-scale  (

50

  m)  irregularities  which  works  only  with 

l⊥ <

ordinary waves. The mechanism of strong attenuation of waves independent on their polarization has 

been  suggested  basing  on  the  theory  of  the  multiple  scattering  from  irregularities  with  characteristic 

scale  lengths 

~l⊥ 100–1000  m.  The  experimental  results  discussed  in  the  present  paper  can  be 

considered as independent confirmation of the conclusions of this theory on an important role of the 

multiple scattering in the ionosphere both for natural and artificial conditions. 

Very high power (150-250 MW ERP) of the pump wave in the present experimental campaign 

might  create  conditions  for  some  complication  of  the  studied  effect  due  to  possible  development  of 

large-scale (larger than 10 km) irregularities inside the heating region. Multy-beam reflection from the 

ionospheric  layer  with  the  large-scale  irregularities  is  accompanied  by  the  increase  of  the  averaged 

signal amplitude [Zabotin and Zhbankov, 2000]. Manifestation of this effect is well seen in the pump 

wave  amplitude  behavior  in  Fig.  2:  After  arrival  at  the  minimal  value  the  amplitude  is  then  slightly 

increased. Experimentally it has been established earlier that this effect occurs for the heating effective 

radiated power larger than 20 MW [Berezin et al., 1987]. Thus in the considered data this effect can 

coexist  with the anomalous attenuation weakening the latter  in  some degree. Therefore, carrying out 

and  analyzing  the  results  of  special  experimental  campaign  for  the  low  heating  power,  when  the 

anomalous attenuation effect could be observed in its classical form, would be of particular interest.  

 

10 

Basing  on anomalous  attenuation data  a  simple algorithm  of the inverse problem solving has 

been  implemented  in  this  work  to  determine  the  distribution  of  the  HF-induced  intermediate-scale 
electron density disturbances  N∆  in a wide range of altitudes. The calculations give reasonable values 
of  N∆ , which are in good agreement with modern concepts of artificial irregularity formation. Note 
that this is the direct opportunity to measure the  N∆  distribution along the geomagnetic field line. The 

altitude  range  under  consideration  is  limited  only  by  the  frequency  band  used  for  the  probing  wave 

Of  course,  the  method  may  be  improved.  Measurements  of  the  anomalous  attenuation  of  the 

extraordinary  and  ordinary  waves  simultaneously  allow  one,  in  principle,  diagnostics  of  artificial 

irregularities  with  very  different  scales:  small-scale  irregularities  (~1–50  m)  and  intermediate-scale 

irregularities  (~100–1000  m).  An advanced technique should provide  also  possibility to measure the 

background anomalous attenuation caused by the natural irregularities.

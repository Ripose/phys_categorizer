Abstract.    It  has  been  known  for  some  time  that  the  value  L  of  the  vacuum  energy  density  affects  the  propagation 
equation  for  gravitons  -  the  analogue  of  photons  for  the  gravitational  field.  (For  historical  reasons,  L  is  also  called 
"cosmological constant".) More precisely, if L is not zero, then a mass term appears in the propagation equation, such 
that m2=-L. As a consequence, the polarization states of gravitons also change, because a massless particle has only two 
polarization  states  while  a  massive  particle  has  more.  This  effect  of  the  L-term  has  been  confirmed  by  recent 
calculations in a curved background, which is actually the only proper setting, since solutions of the classical Einstein 
equations in the presence of a L-term represent a space with constant curvature. A real value for the mass (when L<0) 
will show up as a slight exponential damping in the gravitational potential, which is however strongly constrained by 
astronomical  data.  The  consequences  of  an  imaginary  mass  (for  L>0)  are  still  unclear;  on  general  grounds,  one  can 
expect the onset of instabilities in this case. This is also confirmed by numerical simulations of quantum gravity which 
became  recently  available.  These  properties  gain  a  special  interest  in  consideration  of  the  following.  (1)  The  most 
recent cosmological data indicate that L is positive and of the order of 0.1 J/m3. Is this value compatible with a stable 
propagation of gravitons? (2) The answer to the previous question lies perhaps in the scale dependence of the effective 
value  of  L.  It  could  then  happen  that  L  is  actually  negative  at  the  small  distance/large  energy  scale  at  which  the 
quantum behavior of gravitational fields and waves becomes relevant. Applications for an advanced propulsion scheme 
is that local contributions to the vacuum energy density (remarkably in superconductors in certain states, and in very 
strong  static  electromagnetic  fields)  can  change  locally  the  sign  of  L,  and  so  affect  locally  the  propagation  and  the 
properties  of  gravitons.  The  graviton  wavefunction,  for  different  values  of  the  parameters,  may  be  characterized  by 
superluminal phase velocity or by unitarity only in imaginary valued time.  

 

INTRODUCTION 

Gravitons  are  the  analogue  of  photons  for  the  gravitational  field,  namely  the  field  quanta  which  are  the  ultimate 
constituents  of  gravitational  waves.  The  recent  surge  of  interest  for  high  frequency  gravitational  waves  (Baker, 
2004),  in  which  the  single-quantum  behaviour  play  an  important  role,  has  prompted  new  studies  of  graviton 
propagation: If high frequency gravitational waves can be successfully generated, possible techniques for deviate or 
focalize them will be one of the next hot issues.  

The  propagation  of  gravitons  in  flat  space-time  or  in  a  space-time  with  small  curvature  can  be  described  by 
equations  which  are  similar  to  those  encountered  in  electromagnetism.  In  this  context,  the  vacuum  energy  density 
plays the role of a very special “medium”, which can give gravitons an effective mass. In the following sections we 
shall consider the cases of zero mass, real mass and imaginary mass. While the zero-mass case is well known and 
settled at the text-book level, the case of real non-zero mass (refraction index n>1, in an optical analogy) has been 
treated in only few works, with uncertain results (see references in Section B); the case of imaginary mass (n<1) is 
still unexplored. 

In  this  work  we  shall  give  a  simplified  treatment  of  all  the  three  cases  above,  based  upon  the  weak-field 
approximation. The most innovative part of our investigation, however, concerns the possibility of “tuning” locally 
the  vacuum  energy  density  (Section  D),  and  so  change  the  effective  refraction  index  felt  by  gravitons  in  their 
propagation.  It 
that  systems  with  macroscopic  quantum  coherence,  notably  superfluids  and 
superconductors, are the best candidates for this purpose.

Note: SI units cannot be used in this matter, because they were too impractical. The employed units ("natural units") 
are introduced in Section C, where the conversion factors to SI units are also given. 

A. Gravitons in the Linearized Einstein Theory without Vacuum Energy Density 

The  linearized  theory  is  appropriate  to  situations  where  space-time  is  almost  flat  and  gravitational  fields  are  very 
weak,  i.e.  to  all  situations  which  do  not  involve  very  dense  and  massive  bodies.  In  this  approximation,  the  field 
equations  in  vacuum  are  linear,  and  so  gravitational  field  and  waves  do  not  self-interact,  nor  interact  with  those 
produced by other sources. The field equations contain only derivatives of the field. Their plane wave solution has 
the form

non-vanishing  components  of  mnh are  only  two,  called  the  transversal  components  with  helicity

quantum theory we can regard the (complex)  Y as the wave function of a particle called graviton, having spin 2, 
(helicity

In spite of these similarities, gravitons are much more difficult to observe than photons. The probability that a high-
frequency  graviton  is  emitted  in  an  atomic  or  nuclear  transition  is  generally  small,  because  the  coupling  constant

The main natural sources of gravitons are then astrophysical systems like binary stars, collapsing or exploding stars 
with large mass and variable quadrupolar momentum. The corresponding frequencies are low, up to 1 KHz max, so 
the single gravitons in the emitted gravitational waves carry a very small energy and cannot be easily observed.

The 
This can be deduced from the classical field equations, or in the quantum theory, where the force can be thought as 
generated by the exchange of virtual gravitons, in (partial) analogy to the electromagnetic and the weak and strong 
forces of the standard model (Modanese, 1995).

If  the  wave  equation  of  a  field/particle  contains,  besides  the  derivatives  of  the  field,  also  a  positive  term  Y2m
 
proportional to the field itself (see the next section for the explicit form of this equation), then the solution is still of

Now, starting from the Einstein equations in vacuum there is only one way, consistent with general covariance (i.e., 
independent  on  the  coordinate  system)  to  introduce  a  mass  term:  one  adds  a  source  term  of  the  form

from  their  relative  motion).  We  shall  see  later  what  the  origin  of  this  background  could  be.  In  the  weak  field

approximation  the  field  equations  then  give  a  solution  with  mass  such  that

Beyond  the  linearized  approximation,  things  get  much  more  complicated.  The  vacuum  energy  background  gives 
space-time a small constant curvature, so one has to re-analyse all particle properties in the context of curved space. 
It is difficult to distinguish, in the solutions of field equations, the effects of a mass term from those of the space-

C. Gravitons with Imaginary Mass 

What happens if the mass term  Y2m  in the field equation is negative, i.e. m is imaginary? The usual answer is that 
in this case the quantum theory “does not exist”, because it is neither stable nor unitary. In order to understand better 
this point, one needs to write the field equation explicitly. It is quite convenient for this to introduce the so-called 
“natural”  units,  chosen  in  such  a  way  that 
.  In  these  units,  velocity  is  adimensional  and  expressed  as  a 
fraction of the velocity of light. As a consequence, space and time have the same unit, the cm; but while as length

unit the cm corresponds to the usual cm, as time unit it corresponds to the time it takes for light to travel for 1 cm, 
i.e. ~ 1 sec/3(cid:215)1010. The unit for energy is the cm-1, with the conversion 1 cm-1~3(cid:215)10-23 J. Mass is also measured in cm-
1, with the conversion 1 cm-1~10-37 g. The Newton constant G has dimension l2 and is of the order of 10-66 cm2. 

The wave equation in these units is

The  graviton  would  thus  become  a  “tachyon”,  a  bizarre  kind  of  particle  that  has  long  been  postulated  but  never 
observed  (Rembielinski,  1992,  and  ref.s).  According  to  special  relativity,  the  propagation  of  tachyons  violates 
causality relations, and so they are usually thought to play only a marginal role in some cosmological models and in 
string theory.

Therefore the squared module of  Y , giving the probability to find the particle, is not constant in time – which is 
also called the “non -unitarity” property. Alternatively, the wave function is found to be unitary in  imaginary valued 
time. It is hard to believe that a particle could fade out of reality as a function of time, instead the possible existence 
of  imaginary  time  is  consistent  with  the  approach  followed  in  Euclidean  quantum  gravity  (Gibbons,  1993)  and 
theories on Faster-Than-Light travel in higher dimensional spacetimes (Froning, 2004). 

D. Global and Local Values of the Vacuum Energy Density 

In this Section we shall give the sign and magnitude order of L according to the cosmological observations, i.e. at 
very large scale, and the postulated sign and magnitude order of possible local contributions to the vacuum energy 
density  due  to  the  presence  of  certain  physical  systems  (static  electromagnetic  fields,  superconductors).  Since 

2

, the sign and magnitude of L define whether the graviton mass is real or imaginary, and how much 

infra- or super-luminal is its propagation, and for which values of its momentum, and how quickly, its wave function 
changes in the case of imaginary energy. 

The  latest  measurements  of  the  expansion  rate  of  the  universe  yield  L~10-50  cm-2  as  most  probable  value  of  the 
cosmological constant, which implies a vacuum energy density, in SI units, L/8pG~10-1 J/m3. Earlier observations 
set an upper limit on L of the order of 10-54 cm-2, so it was thought to vanish exactly for symmetry reasons. In fact, 
the  observed  non-zero  value  of  L  creates  an  arduous  fine-tuning  problem,  because  quantum  fields  give  large 
contributions with different signs to the cosmological constant, in two ways: 

(1) Their zero-point oscillations are associated with a huge energy density, whose value depends on the frequency 
cut-off. 

(2)  Some  fields  can  have  a  non-vanishing  vacuum  expectation  value  F0  =  <0|F|0>.  Such  contributions  are 
essentially classical. If L is the field lagrangian, the corresponding cosmological term for a scalar field is -8pGL(F0). 
In  elementary  particle  physics  a  non-vanishing  vacuum  expectation  value  is  usually  the  consequence  of  a 
spontaneous symmetry breaking process. 

The above mentioned value of L is global, in the sense that it is supposed to define a uniform background present in 
the  whole  universe.  A  local  contribution  to  the  vacuum  energy  density  can  arise  when  the  state  of  a  localized 
physical system is described by a classical field comparable with the vacuum expectation value of a quantum field. 
Some interesting cases of this kind occur in condensed matter physics. In this context, the physical systems properly 
described by continuous classical-like fields (also at microscopic level, not just in a macroscopic-average sense as 
for fluids) are basically the following: 
 
-  The  electromagnetic  field  in  the  low-frequency  limit,  in  states  where  the  photons  number  uncertainty  is  much 
larger  than  the  phase  uncertainty.  In  this  case,  the  vacuum  energy  contribution  is  equal  to  the  part  of  the  energy-
mng , i.e. to (B2-E2). The magnitude order of this contribution is, for instance, ~102 
momentum tensor proportional to 
J/m3 for an electrostatic field E~106 V/m and ~105 J/m3 for a static magnetic field B~1T. 

- Systems with macroscopic quantum coherence, described by “order parameters”, like superfluids, superconductors 
and  spin  systems.  For  a  superconductor  described  by  a  collective  wave  function  obeying  the  Ginzburg-Landau 
equation,  in  the  non-relativistic  limit  it  is possible to express L as a function of |yGL| (Modanese, 2003). Relevant 
values of L are those for the case of constant pairs density (for instance, L up to ~106 J/m3 for YBCO) and those at 
local density extrema (|L| up to ~108 J/m3 for YBCO; L>0 for maxima, L<0 for minima). 

Let us now see which graviton mass corresponds to the cosmological value of L and to the different kinds of local 
“effective  L”. To the cosmological value   L~-10-50 cm-2 corresponds an imaginary mass with absolute value |m|~10-
25 cm-1~10-62 g. According to our previous discussion, and taking advantage of the simple properties of the natural 
units,  we  find  that  gravitons  with  wavelength  l<1025  cm  have  real  energy  and  velocity  exceeding  the  velocity  of 
light by a factor

Gravitons  with  wavelength  l>1025  cm  (i.e.,  larger  than  107  light  years!)  have  imaginary  energy  and  the  absolute 
value of their wave function evolves exponentially with a time constant of ~1025 cm~1015 sec~109 years. 

The  negative  effective  L  in  superconductors  can  be  ~109  times  larger  than  the  cosmological  value  (compare  the 
estimate  of  the vacuum energy density L/8pG above), but it still very small. We then have |m|~10-20 cm-1~10-57 g. 
Gravitons  with  wavelength  l<1020  cm  have  real  energy  and

. The static gravitational force 

The possibility of Faster-Than-Light travel is based on a class of postulates regarding the significance of the speed 
of light, the validity of Special Relativity and General Relativity near and beyond c, the possibility of travelling in 
imaginary valued time, etc. Neither science fiction nor current scientific literature clearly explains “what” can really 
do that “jump in hyperspace” that will enable the exploration of the galaxy. Nevertheless if an object or a particle is 
found to be characterized by some suitable properties, then Faster-Than-Light travel is no longer science fiction, but 
a fact. Studying graviton propagation in spacetimes with a cosmological constant we have found superluminality or 
unitarity  of  the  graviton  wavefunction  only  in  imaginary  time.  Imaginary  valued  time  is  equivalent  to  a  spatial 
coordinate, therefore under these circumstances the graviton is somehow locked in time and propagates in a space 
with 4 space-like coordinates. These findings open new questions; for instance, if imaginary time is required to keep 
the  probability  to  find  the  particle  constant  in  time,  does  imaginary  time  really  exist  in  the  physical  world?  We 
expect  that  experiments  should  satisfy  our  curiosity  in  the  near  future,  as  soon  as  coordinated  generators  and 
detectors of gravitational waves will be made available. 

CONCLUSIONS 

Our results add to the increasing body of knowledge about possible generation and exploitation of high frequency 
gravitational waves for data transmission and space propulsion. 

Standard  field-theoretic  arguments  like  those  of  the  previous  Sections  strictly  apply  to  the  case  when  the graviton 
mass  is  constant  over  all  space.  We  have  seen,  however,  that  the  vacuum  energy  density  can  change  locally.  In  a 
realistic  model  one  will  have  to  take  this  possibility  into  account,  and  consider  for  instance  the  propagation  of 
gravitons  which  are  generated  in  a  region  where  they  have  real  mass  and  then  enter  a  region  where  their  mass  is 
imaginary; and even within such regions, the value of the mass can change during propagation. A formal treatment 
of such situations in quantum field theory is clearly very difficult. From the physical point of view, however, they 
are  nothing  extravagant:  just  think  of  the  analogy  to  light  propagation  through  media  with  variable  optical 
properties.  In  order  to  obtain  a  viable  model,  one  will  therefore  have  to  resort  to  an  empirical/phenomenological 
approach. It is perhaps possible to consider first a semi-classical approximation, with the graviton propagating in the 
“variable -mass potential” m2(x)Y2(x). 

If we want to describe graviton propagation in vacuum over distances of the order of the laboratory scale (m or km) 
we need to know the effective value of L at this scale. This is possibly different from the cosmological value, which 
is  an  average  over  very  large  distances  (Shapiro  and  Solà,  2000).  Remember  that  the  value  of  L  at  very  short 
distances  depends  on  the  high  energy  behavior  of  strong  and  electro-weak  interactions,  on  the  onset  of  super-
symmetry etc.; in much the same way, the value of L at scales about 1 m – 1 km depends on the existence of very 
light particles, with mass of the order of 10-40 g, which are still unknown (they are possible constituents of the dark 
matter, interacting very weakly with ordinary matter). 

The perturbative treatment of graviton propagation outlined in this paper has some inherent limitations. In particular, 
in  the  case  of  imaginary  mass  a  full  strong-field  treatment  could well give evidence of more dramatic instabilities 
(“dipolar  fluctuations” (Modanese,  2003))  a nd  non-unitary  behavior.  For  instance,  in  the  numerical  simulations of 
Euclidean  quantum  gravity  by  Hamber  (2000),  discretized  spacetimes  with  L<0  quickly  “collapse”,  because  the 
configurations with small volume are energetically more favourable in that case. The magnitude orders given in this 
paper are therefore quite conservative. 

In  conclusion,  we  have  found  that  certain  physical  systems  behave,  with  respect  to  graviton  propagation,  like  the 
analogue  of  optical  media  with  refraction  index  n<1  and  n>1.  This  happens  when  their  local  contribution  to  the 
vacuum energy density is respectively positive or negative, and so the induced graviton mass is respectively  real or 
imaginary.  

We expect that “n” can differ substantially from 1 in the case  n>1, due to non-perturbative quantum gravity effects. 
(There  is  also  some  experimental  evidence  for  this,  because  the  gravitational  anomalies  in  superconductors 

(Podkletnov, 1997; Podkletnov and Modanese, 2003) seem to require a negative vacuum energy density (Modanese, 
2003)). 

It  is  therefore  conceivable  that  “gravitational  lenses”  can  be  built  in  the  laboratory,  resembling  those  observed  in 
astrophysics, but such to offer a choice of different shapes and effects. This represents the main practical conclusion 
of this work, relevant for possible applications to space propagation or data transmission, and a strong motivation for 
continuing  our  investigation.  We  can  imagine  that  artificially-generated  gravitons  can  be  driven  through  such 
lensing devices in order to obtain directional thrust. Or we can imagine to use lensing devices to collect and focalize 
natural  gravitons  from  an  homogeneous  cosmic  background  which  would  otherwise  be  inaccessible.  In  addition, 
because gravitons have positive mass near their source, a conceptually simple propulsion system based on reaction 
can  be  conceived,  with  the  great  advantage  that  the  mass  of  the  graviton  is  not  a  part  of  spacecraft  mass,  the 
propulsion system is based on reaction but it is not a rocket.  

Our formulation also suggests the possible physical existence of imaginary valued time. This discovery is surprising 
and  requires  experimental  investigation,  which  could  be  performed  with  coordinated  generators  and  detectors  of 
gravitational waves.

ABSTRACT

method,  to  calculate  the  parameters  of  the  polarization  ellipse  by  only  using  a 
single polarizer and a detection device for measuring the outgoing intensities.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 

Polarization  is  a  physical  property  common  to  all  types  of  vector  waves.  It  refers  to  the  time 
behavior of one of the field vectors describing that particular wave, observed at some fixed point in space. 
In  this  case,  we  will  be  concerned  with  the  vibration  of  the  electric  field  vector  E.  Polarization 
measurements  can  be  quite  useful  in  a  variety  of  situations  [1].  For  example,  an  interesting  case  occurs 
when a plane polarized light beam (a light-wave probe) is allowed to pass through a succession of optical 
devices,  each  of  which  produces  a  specific  change  only  in  the  state  of  the  polarization  of  the  probe. 
Knowledge  of  the  initial  and  final  states  of  polarization  of  the  probe  can  be  used  to  investigate  the 
assemblage that modifies the state of polarization. The description of the optical system that interacts with 
the light-probe, as well as the effect of modifying the polarization state, can be done with the Jones matrix 
calculus. However, in order to preserve an intuitive understanding of the physical processes involved in 
the polarization measurements, we will not use the Jones calculus here. We emphasize that the equation 
for the transmitted intensity derived further in the text can also be achieved with the Jones matrix method. 
For more detailed discussion, the reader is referred to the literature [1,2,3,4].  

Our task will be to develop a practical procedure for determining the parameters of the polarization 
ellipse of an arbitrary beam of plane polarized monochromatic light. In doing so, we are only allowed to 
use  a  polarizer  and  a  detection  device  for  measuring  the  intensity  of  the  light  transmitted  through  the 
polarizer.  According  to  the  Stokes  parameters  [1,5],  measurements  performed  for  three  incompatible 
orientations of the transmission axis of the polarizer are enough to find the shape and the orientation of the 
polarization  ellipse  (for  an  ideal  polarizer,  ψ1  and  ψ2  are  compatible  angles  if  I(ψ1)  =  I(ψ2),  which  is 
fulfilled when ψ1 = ψ2 ± π; by I we designate the value of the intensity, and ψ is the angle that describes 
the orientation of the transmission axis of the polarizer towards the incident light). But practice shows that 
the results are more accurate and reliable when doing measurements for a large number of angles.

II. THE LEAST SQUARES APPROXIMATION 
 

When performing polarization measurements on a plane polarized light by using only one polarizer 
and a detection device for measuring the outgoing intensity (Fig. 1), it is appropriate to calculate several 
points  for  determining  the  polarization  ellipse.  This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  small  fluctuations  of  the 
intensity and imperfections of the polarizers can lead to huge deviations in the values of the parameters of 
the ellipse. Our mathematical derivations can be further simplified by taking only one assumption - the E 
vector is rotating in a plane and it describes a closed curve - an ellipse.

transmitted through the polarizer.

y = y(x) is the best fit of the experimental data 

The algorithm for fitting the experimentally obtained intensities for several values of the angle of 
the polarizer can be accomplished with the least squares approximation [6]. The mathematical structure of 
this method can be explained by using the graph depicted in Fig. 2. We designate by x1, x2, x3, ..., xN the 
measured values of the physical observable x, and by y1, y2, y3, ..., yN the measured values of the physical 
observable  y  corresponding  to  x.  In  our  case,  x  is  the  angle  ψ  that  describes  the  orientation  of  the 
transmission axis of the polarizer, and y is the intensity I of the outgoing light. Here N denotes the total 
3N ≥ .  The  aim  of  the  least  squares  method  is  to  fit  the 
number  of  performed  measurements,  and 
experimental points (xi,yi) to a theoretical curve y = y(x,a1,a2,...,aK), or in other words, to adjust a set of 
parameters {aj ; j = 1, 2, ..., K} in a way which will cause the function y = y(x,a1,a2,...,aK) to become “the 
closest one” to the measured points (xi,yi) in the sense that the value of

is minimized. Usually, y = y(x,a1,a2,...,aK) is called trial function (or trial curve), and it corresponds to the 
equation  obtained  with  the  theoretical  model  which  gives  a  proper  description  of  the  physical  situation. 
The least squares approximation is then given through the following set of K equations in K unknowns 
{aj}:

The system (2) is usually nonlinear, and, if the solution of the system exists and if it is unique, it can be 
approximately solved by using certain numerical techniques. When the set of values {aj} are found, the 
least squares curve can be written as y = y(x). 
 
 
III. THE POLARIZATION ELLIPSE 
 

 

Before  we  proceed,  we  need  to  make  some  remarks  concerning  the  E  -  field  of  the  elliptically 
polarized light which is incident on the polarizer. Strictly speaking, the endpoint of the E vector is actually 
describing  a  periodic  helix-like  curve  along  the  direction  of  the  Poynting  vector  in  three  dimensional 
space. The projection of the helix on the plane perpendicular to the Poynting vector is an ellipse, and the 
period of the helix equals that of the light wave (for a visible light, T~10-15 s ). Now, if we assume that the 
velocity  of  the  light  wave  is  approximately  the  velocity  of  the  light  in  vacuo  (~3×108  m/s),  then  the 
distance which is propagated by the light beam during one period is roughly 0.3 µm, the value which is 
several thousand times smaller compared to the thickness of the polarizing filter. This gives us a right to 
look at the polarization state of the light in a narrow region where the polarizer is located while virtually 
“freezing”  its  propagation  along  the  direction  of  the  Poynting  vector.  So,  in  further  modeling  of  the 
polarization state, we are encouraged to say that the endpoint of the E vector is describing an ellipse in 
plane, which, in another hand, can be characterized by certain parameters [1,4,5].

is 

Fig.  4. Back  view  of  the  polarizer.  The  transmitted 
light  beam  is  perpendicular  to  the  plane  of  the  figure 
and  it  propagates  towards  the  reader,  while  its  electric 
field  vector Eψ is  oscillating  along  the  direction  of the 
transmission axis. 

 
In  Fig.  3  we  have  a  XY  drawing  of  an  E  -  ellipse.  It  must  be  emphasized  that  the  light  beam  is 
perpendicular to the plane of the figure and its direction of propagation is towards the reader. The same 
holds for Fig. 4.  

The  inclination  angle  θ  (or  azimuthal  angle,  azimuth)  is  the  angle  between  the  major  axis  of  the 
ellipse and the positive direction of the X - axis, and defines the orientation of the ellipse in its plane [1]. 

All  physically  distinguishable  azimuths  can  be  obtained  by  limiting  θ  to  the  range  −

 is the ratio of the length of the semi-minor axis of the ellipse b to the length of its semi-

major  axis  a.  The  amplitude  W,  also  known  as  the  size  of  an  elliptical  vibration,  can  be  conveniently 
defined in terms of the lengths a and b of the semi-major and the semi-minor axes as

The amplitude W is a measure of the strength of the elliptical vibration and its square is proportional to the 
energy density of the wave at the point of observation of the field. The phase difference δ between X - and 
Y - oscillation of the electric field vector E satisfies the following relation [4]

It will be shown later in the text that EXmax and EYmax are correlated with a, b and θ. The handedness of the 
polarization ellipse determines the way in which the ellipse is described. It is a parameter that can assume 
only  one  of  two  discrete  “values”.  The  polarization  is  right  handed  if  the  ellipse  is  traversed  in  a 
clockwise sense when looking against the direction of propagation of the light beam. The polarization is 
left handed if the ellipse is traversed in a counterclockwise sense. It follows that the actual shape, size and 
handedness of the E - ellipse determine the state of polarization of the incoming light. 

The equation of the E - ellipse in polar coordinate system (E,ϕ) can be expressed as

In  the  process  of  derivation  of  the  fitting  algorithm  we  assume  that  the  time  dependence  of  the  angular 
displacement ϕ = ϕ(t) of the E - field is not known.  

The electric field vector Eψ of the linearly polarized light which is transmitted by the polarizer is an 
orthogonal  projection  of  the E - field of the incoming elliptically polarized light on the direction of the 
transmission axis ψ of the polarizer 
 
 
 
where eψ is the unit vector in the ψ direction. Taking into account that I =E², we obtain the intensity of 
the transmitted light 
 

          Eψ(t) = E[ϕ(t)] ⋅ cos[ϕ(t) - ψ]  ⋅ eψ ,

It can be noticed that Iψ(t) is time-dependent and it oscillates between two extreme values. The maximal 
value of the intensity which passes through the polarizer when the orientation of its transmission axis is ψ 
degrees counterclockwise towards the X - axis (Fig. 4), is described by 
 
 
 
In order to derive equation (8), one must take the first derivative of (7) with respect to ϕ and then equal 
the result to zero. By solving the equation obtained in this manner, one gets the optimal value of ϕ. It can

be shown that there are two kinds of solutions in ϕ. When the first solution is replaced in (7), one gets the 
minimal  value  of  the  transmitted  intensity.  The  minimal  value  of  the  intensity  is  zero,  which  is  quite 
obvious. When the second solution in ϕ is replaced, one obtains the relation (8).  

Now,  the  usual  measuring  equipment,  which  can  be  found  in  almost  every  optical  laboratory, 
consists  of  a  photodiode  connected  to  a  multimeter  via  amplification  device.  The  intensity  value  of  the 
light which is detected by the multimeter is actually the root-mean-square (RMS, or, effective value) of the 
transmitted  intensity  averaged  for  one  period  (the  time  it  takes  for  the  E  vector  to  describe  the  ellipse 
once, rotating in the polar plane for the angle of 2π radians, or, equivalently, the time required for the Eψ 
vector to make one complete linear oscillation along the direction defined with ψ)

However, if we connect the photodiode to an oscilloscope or some other device from which we can read 
the maximal value of the transmitted light intensity, we can apply equation (8) as a trial curve in the fitting 
procedure. Otherwise, there should be a real positive function in the equation (8), denoted by α(ψ), which 
multiplies  the  whole  right  hand  side  of  it.  The  value  of  α(ψ)  can  be  theoretically  derived  from  (9)  and 
from (7) if the time dependence of the angular displacement ϕ = ϕ (t) is known. Immediately, it follows 

that  α ψ

axis. In that case, α is a real positive constant, called scaling (or amplification) factor. This allows us to 
use equation (8) in its original form while thinking of the whole process of measuring the intensity like it 
is performed with an imaginary amplifying device with an amplification factor of 1/α. The only value that 
is affected by this is the amplitude W, but the shape and the handedness of the ellipse remain unchanged.  

While  further  developing  the  algorithm,  we  assume  that  the  measurements  are performed with an 
apparatus  which  detects  the  maximal  intensity  value.  Then,  equation  (8)  can  be  implemented  as  a  trial 
curve without any modifications. 
 
 
IV. FITTING PROCEDURE 
 

The next step is obtaining an algorithm for fitting the I(ψ) curve. The reader can notice that in order 
to calculate the parameters of the polarization ellipse described by the E - field, we are actually fitting the 
intensity curve of the transmitted light. The trial curve we will use in the least squares fitting procedure is

It can be noticed that by implementing (13), one is assured that the system (12) becomes linear.  

Although  derivation  of  the  least  squares  equations  for  the  ellipticity  ε,  the  amplitude  W  and  the 
azimuth θ is straightforward from (13) and the definitions given at the beginning of the previous section 
(we take into account that a = a1, b = a2 and θ = a3), deriving the equation for the phase difference requires 
some explanation. Bearing in mind that the maximal intensity equals the square modulus of the amplitude, 
the values of EXmax and EYmax follow from equation (8) by putting ψ = 0 for EXmax and ψ = π/2 for EYmax ,

V. CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 

The least squares fitting procedure for calculation of the polarization ellipse parameters is based on 

the equations (15) - (18) and the system (12). The algorithm can be carried out in several steps: 
 

1. Perform a measurement on the maximal intensity of the light I which passes 
through the polarizer. Repeat this for N different values for the orientation of the 
angle of the transmission axis ψ. Take into account that the values ψi  must not 
be  compatible  to  each  other  and  that  you  need  to  perform  three  or  more 
measurements for determining the ellipse correctly.  
 
2.  When  the  N  pairs  of  real  numbers  (ψi,Ii)  are  established,  calculate  the 
coefficients Dnm and Fn (n, m = 1, 2, 3) of the linear system (12).  
 
3. By using the standard procedures for solving linear systems (Row-reduction 
method or Cramer’s rule [7]), find the values of p, q and r.  
 
4. By substitution of the values of p, q and r in the equations (15) - (18), get the 
parameters of the ellipse. Make a graph of the polarization ellipse.  Discuss the 
result. 

Due  to  the  periodicity  of  the  tangens  function,  there  is  a  problem  in  determining  the  inclination 
angle θ. The reader should recall that since tan(2θ) = tan(2θ + π), there are two azimuths for which the 

equation (17) is satisfied:

 and

by calculating the value of ∆ function given with equation (11), once for a3 = θ1, and once again for a3 = 
θ2. In both cases, a1 and a2 can be expressed through p, q and r by eliminating a3 from the set of equations 
(13). The correct value of the azimuth is the one that makes the value of ∆ minimal.    

However,  the  handedness  of  the  ellipse,  or  in  other  words,  the  sense  in  which  the  ellipse  is 
described  by  the  E  vector  (clockwise  or  counterclockwise),  cannot  be  evaluated.  This  stems  on  the  fact 
that cosine function is even, so the sign of δ cannot be determined from (18). For its evaluation, further 
experiments must be performed, for example, by adding a quarter-wave retardation plate to the setup [4].

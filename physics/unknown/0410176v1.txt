Introduction 
 

 
As demonstrated by theory and experiments, e.g. [1-4], optimization of the magnetic field 
topology  in  tokamaks  by  specifying  favorable  current  profiles  can  improve  the  plasma 
confinement at reduced inductive current. One such promising approach is a so-called current 
hole scenario featuring a central plasma region with no poloidal field due (near) zero toroidal 
current  density  there.  The  establishment  of  a  current  hole  (CH)  occurs  typically  with  the 
formation  of  internal  transport  barriers  suppressing  the  bulk  plasma  transport  within  the 
current hole and allowing for stable plasma equilibrium over remarkably long periods [5-8]. 
Though  a  CH  regime  is  recognized  to  provide  better  detention  of  the  bulk  plasma,  it  may 
negatively  act  on  the  confinement  of  fast  ions  [9-12]  such  as  fusion  products  and  neutral-
beam injected (NBI) ions. Since, however, the transport properties of these energetic particles 
determine the heating profiles and the power loading upon the first wall, and therefore are of 
crucial importance in a fusion reactor, we examine here analytically the CH effects on the fast 
ion  behavior  in  a  tokamak.  For  that  we  employ  a  simplified  model  based  on  an  analytical 
approximation of the poloidal flux function [10] allowing for a complete characterization of 
possible  orbit  topologies.  In  the  constants-of-motion  space  we  determine  the  confinement 
domains for the different types of ion orbits, calculate the CH induced alterations of the fast 
ion transport and derive the distribution of NBI ions for a specific JET CH plasma scenario.

equilibria, the simple linear model from Ref. [10],

Since  the  plasma  particles  in  tokamaks  usually  accumulate  in  the  central  region  near  the 
minor axis, the investigation of the confinement of ion orbits crossing a current hole that is 
located there, is of evident interest. To  prevent  from  potential  double  counting  of  orbits

also  the  width  of  orbits  is  seen  to  decrease  until  reduction  to  the  stagnation  point.  In  the 
confinement domain for counter-going particles in Fig. 2b, where the locus of the separatrix is 
seen to be equivalent with that of stagnation orbits, only two regions are to be distinguished, 
the one with orbits outside the current hole and the other with orbits crossing the hole area. 
The  latter  region  appears  considerably  smaller  than  in  the  case  of  co-going  orbits,  where  it 
extends nearly to the wall for the chosen I.

          Comparison  of  the  confinement  domains  of  low/moderate  and  high  energy  ions  in  a 
current hole tokamak [13] shows that, in the low energy case, there exists only a tiny fraction 
of  trapped  particles  passing  the  current  hole,  whereas,  for  high  energy  ions  the  region  of 
trapped ions crossing the current hole appears substantially larger. Moreover, the latter may 
Mx < . Consequently, the portion of trapped fast ions that 
not appear as a closed area within 
Mx >   will  hit  the  torus wall. This first orbit 
move  through  the  current  hole  on  orbits  with 
loss  of  fast  ions  is  independent  of  collision  and  transport  processes,  and  occurs  as  well  for 
particles that do not pass the current hole. This confinement deterioration by the presence of a 
current hole becomes exceptionally strong in the case of relatively low total plasma currents. 
In  order  to  achieve  good  fast  ion  retention  in  the  plasma,  the  total  current  has  to  be 
,  a  critical  value  [10]  required  to  confine  the  fattest  banana  orbits 
crossing  the  central  plasma  region.  Note  that  for  Fig.  2a 
  was  chosen  enabling  the 
confinement of all trapped fusion alphas crossing the current hole. Equivalently, for a given 
plasma current I a critical energy can be identified for fast ions of mass m and charge Z as

close to the magnetic axis, they seem to be shifted outwards by the presence of a current hole.

Since  the  poloidal  gyroradius  is  d
,  an  important  effect  of  slowing  down  is  the 
decrease of the maximum radial excursion of orbits as seen from Fig. 7, where the initial NBI

Conclusions 
  The  model  proposed  yields  manageable  analytical  expressions  describing  the  entire 
influence  of  a  current  hole  on  the  confinement  domains  of  fast  ions  as  well  as  on  the 
boundaries  separating  the  regions  of  different-type  orbits  in  the  constants-of-motion  space.  
For specific cases of relevance, i.e. on axis injected beam ions on near stagnation orbits where 
the  maximum  density  occurs,  even  an  analytical  treatment  of  the  bounce  averaged  Fokker-
Planck equation is rendered possible and delivers distribution functions in the COM space in 
satisfactory  agreement  with  quantitative  numerical  Fokker-Planck  simulations.  Hence  this 
suggests the use of the simplified model for further investigations of fast particle behavior in 
current hole tokamak plasmas.

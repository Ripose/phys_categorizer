Single  photonic  applications  –  such  as  quantum  key  distribution  –  rely  on  the 
transmission  of  single  photons,  and  require  the  ultimate  sensitivity  that  an 
optical detector can achieve. Single-photon detectors must convert the energy of 
an  optical  pulse  containing  a  single  photon  into  a  measurable  electrical  signal. 
We  report  on  fiber-coupled  superconducting  single-photon  detectors  (SSPDs) 
with specifications that exceed those of avalanche photodiodes (APDs), operating 
at  telecommunication  wavelength,  in  sensitivity,  temporal  resolution  and 
repetition frequency. The improved performance is demonstrated by measuring 
the  intensity  correlation  function  g(2)(τ)  of  single-photon  states  at  1300nm 
produced by single semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). 

 

While  silicon-based  avalanche  photodiodes  (APDs)  can  be  used  as  single-photon 
detectors  in  the  visible  wavelength  range,  a  mature  technology  with  single-photon 
sensitivity  is  still  lacking  at  telecom  wavelengths  (1310-1550  nm).  The  poor 
performance  of  InGaAs  APDs  barely  satisfies  the  requirements  for  secure  quantum 
key distribution, limiting the maximum distance and sifted key rate. More generally, 
progress in the development of systems based on processing and measuring photonic 
quantum bits at these wavelengths is hindered by the lack of adequate detectors. As 
an  example,  while  single-photon  sources  based  on  semiconductor  quantum  dots 
(QDs)  have  been  extensively  characterized  at  λ<1000  nm,  only  few  clear 
demonstrations  of  single-photon  emission  have  been  reported  at  1300  nm1,2.  The 
recent  development  of  single-photon  detectors  based  on  NbN  superconducting 
nanostructures3,  promise  orders-of-magnitude  improvement  over  InGaAs  APDs  in 
sensitivity, dark count, jitter and repetition frequency. The detection principle of the 
SSPDs is based on the local inhibition of superconductivity in a current-biased ultra-
thin  superconducting  nanowire  due  to  the  absorption  of  a  light  quantum4.  As  the 
superconducting  energy  gap  is  about  2meV  for  NbN,  an  absorbed  near-infrared 
photon supplies a sufficient amount of energy to brake a Cooper pair and promote an 
electron to a highly excited state. During the relaxation process secondary carriers are 
efficiently  generated  and  the  local  electron  effective  temperature  exceeds  the 
superconducting  critical  temperature,  thus  creating  a  ‘hot  spot’. As  the  supercurrent 

avoids  the  hot  spot  and  accumulates  towards  the  edge  of  the  nanowire,  the  critical 
current  density  may  be  reached  inducing  a  transition  to  a  resistive  state  and  a 
subsequent pulse in the external circuit. In the following we report on fiber-coupled 
SSPDs  with  sensitivity  several  orders  of  magnitude  larger  than  InGaAs  APDs,  and 
demonstrate their application to single-photon measurements at telecom wavelengths.

thick wires. 

 

 

The SSPDs used in this work consist of 10x10µm2 meanders (fig1) made of a 100nm 
wide,  3.5nm 
thick  NbN  nanowire.  Two  SSPD  chips  are  mounted  on  a 
micromechanical  support  and  aligned  to  a  pair  of  single  mode  fibers,  the  system  is 
then  cooled  down  to  2.3K.  The  fabrication  technology  is  described  in  Ref.5.  The 
dependence  of  the  detection  efficiency  (DE)  as  a  function  of  bias  current  is  shown 
along with the dark count rate (DCR) in Figure 2a for the best SSPD. The DE for the 
SSPD  refers  to  the  percentage  of  single-photon  pulses  incident  on  the  detector  that 
will produce an output signal. Both DE and dark counts increase with increasing bias 
current.  At  a  bias  current  of  IB=22  µA  an  efficiency  DE=4.8%  and  dark  count  rate 
DCR=13Hz are measured. The other SSPD had lower efficiency (2.5%) for the same 
DCR. The corresponding DE/DCR ratios are over a factor of 10 higher than previous 
reports  for  fiber-coupled  SSPDs  6,  7.  The  tail  in  the  DCR,  measured  below  a  bias 
current  of  25µA  (Figure  2a),  is  attributed  to  the  room  temperature  background 
radiation entering the system, which can be suppressed by a cold filter. 

A direct comparison with APDs is complicated by the fact that InGaAs APDs must 
be operated in gated mode, so that only a dark count probability (DCP) per gate (1ns) 
can be defined, which is a function of the gate width. In order to provide an operative 
comparison of SSPDs and APDs, for autocorrelation experiments on QDs, we define 
a signal to noise ratio normalized to a time window of 1ns (see Methods for details). 
In  Figure  2b  we  plot  the  SNR  for  the  SSPD  and  the  APD  as  a  function  of  the 
detection  efficiencies.  The  APD  data  point  corresponds  to  the  optimized  working 
regime  used  for  antibunching  measurements  in  Ref.[2].  The  SSPD  display  an 
improvement of several orders of magnitude improvement in the SNRs. 

 

 

Figure  3  reports  the  temporal  dynamics  of  a  laser  diode  pulse  as  measured  directly 
using  a  sampling  oscilloscope  and  by  time-correlated  single-photon  counting 
(TCSPC)  using  the  SSPD  and  the  APD.  From  the  jitter  characteristics  of  the 
correlation card, we estimate the time resolution of the SSPD and APD at 150ps and 
400ps respectively. Lower jitter values (18ps have been reported8) could be achieved

by improving the amplification electronics. We note that the SSPD response follows 
a  Gaussian  distribution,  while  the  APD  presents  an  asymmetric  profile,  which 
depends on the count rate and limits their application for TCSPC experiments. 

In order to validate the application of SSPDs to the characterization of non-classical 
light  states  at  telecom  wavelengths,  we  measured  the  correlations  between  single 
photon pulses produced by a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot emitting at 1300 nm (see 
Methods). The characterization of  the photoluminescence (PL) dynamics and single-
photon emission from this type of QDs using APDs was reported in Ref. [2]. The PL 
spectrum from a single QD (Fig. 4a) is dominated by two lines corresponding to the 
emission from exciton (X) and biexciton (BX) states. As a first test we demonstrate 
single  photon  emission  from  the  X  line  under  non  resonant  pulsed  excitation  at  80 
MHz. We remark that this repetition frequency is unachievable with APDs, which are 
limited  to  a  few  MHz.  The  coincidence  histogram  (Figure  4)  is  characterized  by 
periodic peaks separated by the laser repetition frequency except for zero delays; this 
is the signature of a single photon emitter under pulsed excitation. The peaks are well 
fitted by Gaussian time distributions with an offset of 3 coincidences and a FWHM = 
2.2ns  that  corresponds  to  twice  the  X  lifetime2.  Normalizing  the  counts  in  2.2ns 
windows we calculate a g(2)(0)=0.18. This value is lower than the result (g(2)(0)=0.38) 
obtained  under  similar  conditions  using  two  InGaAs  APDs2  due  to  the  10-fold 
increase of the SNR in this experiment. The coincidences between the peaks are due 
to uncorrelated light entering the system and detector dark counts, thus increasing the 
g(2)(0).

While these pulsed measurements  allow an estimation of g(2)(0), which is important 
for applications that use single-photon sources, many important physical properties of 
the  system  are  hidden  in  the  correlation  function  g(2)(τ)  for  any  delay  τ9,10,11.  The 
measurement  of  the  g(2)(τ)  with  APDs  is  exceedingly  difficult  since  the  use  of 
relatively  long  (>10ns)  gates  would  drive  the  experimental  SNR  below  unity.  The 
g(2)(τ) was measured on the positively charged exciton emission (inset fig 5b) under 
cw  excitation  by  pumping  resonantly  in  the  excited  state  of  the  trion.  The  resulting 
histogram,  measured  for  a  pump  power  of  ~0.2mW,  is  shown  in  Fig.  5a  for  long 
delays (~0.5µs). For time delays between 3ns and 200ns an increase of the correlation 
function  is  observed:  this  bunching  behavior,  already  studied  for  short-wavelength 
QDs12, shows that after emission of a photon from the positive trion the QD remains 
charged allowing the re-excitation of the charged exciton state. For short time delays 
τ≤3ns,  (see  Fig.  5(b)),  an  antibunching  dip  is  observed,  confirming  the  sub-
Poissonian  statistics  of  the  light  emitted  by  the  trion  line.  The  bunching  and 
antibunching  behavior  can  be  modeled  in  a  three  level  system  with  the  following 
expression13: g(2)(τ) = 1-(1+a)*exp(-τ/τ1)+a*exp(-τ/τ2).  Taking into account the setup 
resolution  and  dark  counts9  the  fit  yields  g  (2)(0)=0.18±0.02  (in  agreement  with  the 
pulsed-mode results) and a bunching time constant of 171ns.

Photon correlation experiments are a key resource in quantum optics, for example for 
the  characterization  of  thermal  light  sources14,  the  measurement  of  spatial 
coherence15, and in quantum coherence optical tomography16. We thus expect that the 
availability of these SSPD systems will significantly improve the range of application 
of quantum technologies in the telecommunication wavelength range. We anticipate 
that  the  dark  count  can  be  reduced  by  more  than  one  order  of  magnitude  with 
appropriate  filtering  of  the  room  temperature  background  radiation  and  even  higher 
efficiencies can be achieved by integrating optical microcavities with the SSPD - up 
to 50% was demonstrated for free-space coupling17. SSPDs thus have a considerable 
potential impact in photonics and quantum optics. 

Methods 

 

Two  single-mode  fibers  were  separately  aligned  to  the  SSPD  chips  using 
micromechanical  precision  holders.  Input  fiber  connectors  and  output  SMA  cables 
are mounted at room temperature on the flange of the cryogenic insert. The insert is 
immersed  in  a  liquid  helium  bath  and  the  detectors  are  cooled  down  to  2.3K  by 
reducing  the  He  vapor  pressure.  The  high  frequency  components  of  the  detector 
output  are  fed  to  a  60  dB-gain  amplifier  with  a  2.5  GHz  bandwidth.  In  the 
autocorrelation experiments the SSPDs are biased through bias-Ts to give a DCR of 
10-30Hz.  The  efficiency  of  the  fiber  coupled  detector  is  measured  using  a  gain-
switched  diode  laser  at  1300nm  and  a  calibrated  APD  as  a  reference.  In  fig.2b  the 
SNR=DE/DCP  values  for  the  SSPD  are  deduced  from  the  data  presented  in  fig.2a. 
For  the  APD  we  used  the  same  definition  of  SNR:  the  DCP  (for  a  1ns  gate)  was 
extrapolated  from  the  dark  count  rate  (30Hz)  measured  during  in  a  300ps  optical 
active window and at a repetition frequency of 4MHz2. 
The  antibunching  measurements  were  made  on  InAs  QDs.  The  low-density 
(~2dots/µm2) ensemble of QDs was grown by molecular beam epitaxy at the center 
of a GaAs/AlAs planar  microcavity, as described in Ref.  [18]. Circular  mesas  of 1.5 
µm diameter were defined by electron-beam lithography and reactive ion etching in 
order  to  isolate  the  emission  of  a  single  QD.  The  excitation  of  the  QDs  and  light 
collection  strategies  are  similar  to  the  ones  described  in  Ref  [2].  The  histogram 
(fig.5(b))  obtained  for  the  autocorrelation  measurements  under  cw  excitation  was 
normalized  and  fitted  using  the  correlation  function  calculated  for  a  three  level 
system13  g(2)(τ)=1-(1+a)exp(-τ/τ1)+a*exp(-τ/τ2).  To  account  for  the  limited  setup 
resolution,  detection  of  uncorrelated  photons  and  dark  counts,  we  fitted  the 
experimental  data  by  convolving  a  gaussian  time  distribution  (FWHM=200ps)  with 
the correlation function corrected for noise9: gn
(2)(τ)= 1+ρ2(g(2)(τ)-1). The fit provides 
the values, ρ=0.91, a=0.8, τ1=0.62ns and τ2=170.8ns.

Abstract 

 

Viscous fluid dynamical calculations require no-slip boundary conditions.  
Numerical calculations of turbulence, as well as theoretical turbulence closure 
techniques, often depend upon a spectral decomposition of the flow fields.  
However, such calculations have been limited to two-dimensional situations.  
Here we present a method that yields orthogonal decompositions of 
incompressible, three-dimensional flow fields and apply it to periodic cylindrical 
and spherical no-slip boundaries.

1. Introduction 
 
We  derive orthogonal decompositions of arbitrary incompressible; i.e., solenoidal, three-
dimensional velocity fields satisfying no-slip boundary conditions for periodic cylindrical and 
spherical geometries.  The no-slip condition requires that all components of the velocity field 
vanish at the boundaries. Numerical calculations of fluid turbulence as well as turbulent closures 
depend on such spectral decompositions.  To date, such no-slip viscous calculations have been 
limited to two-dimensional dynamics.    

A progenitor of this analysis is the development of the scalar Chandrasekhar-Reid 
functions (Chandrasekhar and Reid 1957) used by Chandrasekhar and his coworkers to calculate 
no-slip fluid dynamics in a variety of situations, such as Couette flow (Chandrasekhar 1961).  
These functions have been assimilated into a two-dimensional, orthogonal, presumably complete, 
solenoidal vector basis satisfying no-slip boundary conditions for the study of turbulent 
cylindrical flow by Montgomery and his collaborators (Li and Montgomery 1996, Li et al. 1997).  
Our decompositions allow the application of spectral analyses to three-dimensional fluid 
turbulence with no-slip boundary conditions as well as to three-dimensional 
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.  The latter has application to planetary and stellar 
MHD dynamos and may have relevance to the understanding of transport of quantities such as 
angular momentum in accretion disks around stars and black holes. 

In Sec. 2, we  obtain a three-dimensional basis appropriate for the description of an 

incompressible no-slip flow within a periodic cylinder.  In Sec. 3, we  derive a basis appropriate 
for the description of such a flow within a no-slip spherical boundary.  

The vector fields in these bases are solenoidal; i.e., divergence-free.  Because they are 

divergence-free, they are expressible in terms of curls. Furthermore, the divergence-free property 
implies that they are functions of only two scalar fields.  For each geometry, we  write down two 
classes of vector fields, each dependent on a scalar function.  Requiring that these vector fields 
each vanish at the boundary imposes boundary conditions on the scalar fields.  We then consider 
the inner products of these vector fields. After integrations by parts, we obtain matrix elements of 

a Hermitian operators between the different scalar fields, whose off-diagonal components must 
vanish for our orthogonal field representation.  

Let us represent this Hermitian operator by H0 and the scalar fields by

2. Periodic cylindrical geometry 
 
2.1. Introduction 
 
In this section, we  develop the spectral decomposition of a solenoidal vector field for describing 
an arbitrary flow within an annulus having two no-slip cylindrical boundaries:  an inner boundary 
at    r = r1 and an outer one at r = r2.  (The no-slip condition means merely that all three 
components of the vector field vanish at the boundaries.)  We  assume a periodic length L in the 
z-direction.  The desired solenoidal vector field is then expressible as a sum of two classes of 
components, which we shall see are themselves mutually orthogonal

4. Graphical Results 

We now  present some interesting graphical results for vp.  For the case of the cylinder having a 
radius of 1/2, Fig. 1 presents an example of the radial structure for the three components of this 
vector for the case: k=2/3, m=3 at θ=z=0.  The number of nodes is governed by the eigenvalue.  
Here we have chosen the eigenvalue, 
are depicted in Figs. 1(a,b,c), respectively.  Note the curious structure of 

. The radial, azimuthal, and axial components 

 in Fig. 1b.

The ratio of the relative magnitudes of the components of each of these vectors at these high 
radial wave numbers is also noteworthy.  Since these vectors are unnormalized, the actual 
magnitudes have no significance. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 

We have shown how to derive sets of orthogonal, solenoidal basis vectors that vanish on specified 
boundaries and have obtained these sets for both a periodic cylindrical boundary (including an 
cylindrical periodic annulus) and for a spherical boundary (including a spherical shell). We 
believe these sets of basis vectors provide a complete set for the expansion of an arbitrary 
solenoidal vector all of whose components vanish on the boundary. Our belief stems from the fact 

14

that they arise from solutions of differential equations that are self-adjoint; i.e., Hermitian, by 
construction. This method can be applied also to obtain the analogous basis for a slab geometry in 
which the vectors vanish on two infinite parallel planes. 
 

We should emphasize that our construction is not necessarily unique.  Merely as an 

(
)22
2
⊥∇∇

could be 

example, note that in the second of the two equations of (8), the operator 

(
)32
⊥∇

.  This yields a different differential equation that also provides orthogonal 

replaced by 
solutions, which however are not quite as elegant as those of (10).

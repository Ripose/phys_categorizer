Abstract 

On  the  basis  of  the  separated  form-factor  model,  a  code  for  fitting  the  small-angle 

neutron  scattering  spectra  of  the  polydispersed  vesicle  population  has  been  developed. 

Vesicle  and  membrane  bilayer  parameters  are  analyzed  for  various  hierarchical  models 

of the neutron scattering length density across the membrane. It is shown that hydration 

of vesicle can be described by a linear distribution function of water molecules. For the 

first  time,  the  average  radius  and  polydispersity  of  the  vesicle  population,  thickness  of 

the  membrane  bilayer,  thickness  of  hydrophobic  and  hydrophilic  parts  of  bilayer,  and 

water  distribution  function  have  been  calculated  from  the  SANS  experiment,  without 

additional  methods  such  as  dynamic  light  scattering  or  freeze-fracture  electron 

microscopy.  The  results,  obtained  at  two  different  spectrometers,  are  discussed.  The 

appropriate  conditions  of  the  SANS  experiment  on  vesicles  are  formulated  as  a 

necessity  to  collect  the  SANS  curve  in  the  region  of  scattering  vectors  from 

qmin=0.0033Å-1 to qmax=0.56Å-1.

1.  INTRODUCTION 

Research  to  the  structure  of  phospholipids,  the  main  component of biological membranes, 

is very important from the viewpoint of structural biology and chemistry. Unilamellar vesicles 

are  especially  interesting  because  most  biological  membranes  are  unilamellar.  On  the  other 

hand,  unilamellar  vesicles  can  be  used  as  delivery  agents;  thus,  the  knowledge  of  their 

structure and properties are important for pharmacology [1,2]. 

A  standard  method  to  investigate  the  form  and  size  of  vesicles  is  the  dynamic  and  static 

light  scattering.  However,  in  this  way  it  is  impossible  to  obtain  information  about  the 

thickness and internal structure of the membrane bilayer [3,4].  

A  more  informative  method  is  the  small  angle  neutron  scattering  (SANS).  Membrane 

thickness  can  be  calculated  from  the  experimentally  measured  gyration  radius  of  membrane 

using the Guinier approximation and the Kratky-Porod plot [5-7]. This approach was applied 

for  the  calculation  of  phospholipid  membrane  thickness  [8-12]  and  thickness  of  thylakoid 

membranes  [13]  from  the  measured  value  of  the  gyration  radius.  The  accuracy  of  the 

membrane  thickness  calculation  from  the  experimentally  measured  gyration  radius  increases 

at increasing contrast [9].  

The pair distance distribution function can be calculated via indirect Fourier transformation 

of SANS curve [14]. The indirect Fourier transformation was applied for the calculation of the 

scattering  length  density  across  the  bilayer  for  the  case  of  unilamellar  vesicles  from  the 

oppositely charged surfactant [15].  

The  important  advantage  of  neutron  scattering  relative  in  relation  the  X-ray  scattering  is 

the  possibility  to  use  deuterated  solutions  and  samples.  The  contrast  variation  method  was 

applied  to  characterize  molecular  volume  of phospholipid molecules and membrane thickness 

[8,16]. The method for the evaluation of the deuterated molecule group position derived from 

the SANS curve was proposed in [9].  

Calculation  of  membrane  parameters  from  the  experimental  membrane  radius  of  gyration 

used only a part of scattering curve in the interval of scattering vector q from 0.04 Å-1 to 0.1 

 

2

Å-1.  Nevertheless,  this  approach  was  used  for  the  calculation  of  internal  membrane  structure 

and  hydration  on  the  basis  of  the  strip  function  model  of  neutron  scattering  length  density 

[17,18]. The model of randomly oriented planar bilayer was applied for the characterization of 

membrane thickness [19] and internal membrane structure [18]. 

The  possibility  to  determine  the  internal  structure  of  membrane  depends  on  the  maximum 

value  of  scattering  angle  detected  at  experimental  station  [19,20]  and  possibility  to  subtract 

properly  the  incoherent  background  [20].  On  the  other  hand,  the  possibility  to  evaluate  the 

average  vesicle  radius  increases  at  the  detection  of  the  scattering  curve  at  low  value  of 

scattering vector and decreasing of system polydispersity [19,21,22].  

The  hollow  sphere  (HS)  model  was  applied  for  the  calculation  of  membrane  thickness 

[17,22],  vesicle  radius  [21,22] and internal membrane structure [22] from SANS experiment. 

The approach developed in [20] can be applied for the investigation of oligolamellar vesicles.  

The  application  of  the  HS  model  gives  opportunity  to  describe  the  internal  membrane 

structure  as  two-three  regions  with  a  constant  scattering  length  density  via  the strip function 

model  of  scattering  length  density  across  the  membrane.  The  HS  model  has  two 

imperfections:  (1) one cannot say anything about water distribution in the hydrophilic part of 

the  bilayer;  (2)  for  the  case  of  nondeuterated  lipids  it is impossible to define the place of the 

molecules  inside  the  bilayer,  i.e.  this  approach  makes  it  impossible  to  study  the  multi-

component systems (vesicular based delivery agents of drugs, for example). 

The  separated  form-factors  model  (SFF)  looks  more  perspective  from  this  viewpoint:  it 

allows  one  to  simulate  the  scattering  length  density  by  any  integrable  function  [23].  In  this 

paper, the SFF model is used to study the structure of the polydispersed polulation of vesicles 

from  the  SANS  data.  We  analyze  the  parameters  of  vesicles  and  the  membrane  bilayer  for 

various  hierarchic  models  of  the  scattering  length  density  of  neutron  across  the  membrane. 

We show that the water distribution in the hydrophilic part of membrane can be described by 

a  linear  function.  The  parameters  of  the  vesicle  population  (membrane  thicknesses,  average 

radius,  polydispersity,  number  of  linearly  distributed  water  molecules  in  the  membrane 

 

3

bilayer)  are  calculated  only  from  the  SANS  spectra,  without  additional methods usually used 

to  characterize  the  vesicle  size  and  polydispersity  (dynamic  light  scattering,  freeze-fracture 

electron microscopy). 

Two  small-angle  neutron  scattering  spectrometers  with  different  range  of  accessible 

scattering  vector  were  used:  the  YuMO  instrument  in  JINR,  Dubna,  with  range  of  q  from 

0.0083Å-1  to  0.2Å-1  and  the  SANS-1  instrument  at  PSI  with  range  of  q  from  0.0033Å-1  to

(In  actuality,  r c(x)  is  not  symmetric  due  to  membrane  curvature  and,  for  many  component 

system, due to a possible asymmetry of different components.) Thus, we obtain from Eq.(4):

The number of vesicles per unit volume n=n(R,d) can be obtained in the following way. It 

is known that the molecular volume of DMPC in the liquid phase is equal to 1101Å3 [27]. The 

volume of the lipid bilayer in one vesicle can be calculated by formula 

V = 4p /3 [(R+d/2)3–(R-d/2) 3 ]. 

 

 

 

 

 

(10) 

So,  M=V/1101  is  the  number  of  DMPC  molecules  in  a  single  vesicle.  The  concentration  of 

DMPC  in  our  experiment  was  15mM.  The  number  of  DMPC  molecules  in  cm3  is  calculated 

as

To  fit  the  SANS  data  in  the  framework  of  SFF  model,  the  Fortran  code  was  developed 

using  the  minimization  code  DFUMIL  from  the  JINRLIB  library  (JINR,  Dubna). In order to 

estimate the fit quality, we used the following formula:

where  N  is  a  number  of  experiment  points,  qi  is  experimentally  measured  value  of  scattering 

vector, I(qi) – experimentally measured macroscopic cross sections.  

The  fitting  parameters  are  the  average  vesicle  radius  R ,  coefficient  of  polydispersity  m, 

thickness  of  the  lipid  bilayer  d,  and  parameters  of  function  r (x)  modeling  the  neutron 

scattering  length  density  of  bilayer.  We  considered  three  types  of  r (x)  function  presented  at 

Fig. 1a,b,c.  Additional  fit  parameters  are:  (a)  average  contrast  D r   between  D2O  and  average 

scattering  length  density  of  bilayer  r av;  (b)  average  scattering  length  density  of  hydrophilic 

part r PH and thickness of hydrophobic membrane part D; (c) r PH1 scattering length density at 

the hydrophilic-hydrophobic boundary x=– D/2 and value of D. In the cases (b) and (c) we put 

r (cid:0)

(cid:1) = -

 0.36(cid:215) 1010(cid:0) m-2    [20,31].  The  scattering  length  density  r PH2  at  the  boundary  between 

bulk  D2O  and  membrane  x=– d/2  was  a  fixed  parameter.  We  considered  two  cases  (c1)  and 

(c2): (c1) corresponds to r PH2= r D2O =6.4(cid:215) 1010cm-2; (c2) corresponds to r PH2= = 5.4(cid:215) 1010cm-2 

(this value was used in [32]).  

Besides, one can consider the incoherent background IIB as another unknown parameter of 

the  model.  The  value  of  IIB  for  the  case  of  15mM  DMPC  concentration  is  theoretically 

estimated  as  0.00546(cid:0)

-1.  In  the  fitting  of  the  YuMO  spectrometer  data,  this  value  of  the 

incoherent  background  was  used.  For  the  case  of  PSI  SANS  spectrometer,  IIB  was  a  fitted 

parameter.

3. EXPERIMENT 

Unilamellar  dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine  vesicles  (DMPC)  were  prepared  by  handle 

extrusion of 15mM (about 1% w/w) suspension of DMPC in D2O through filters with a pore 

diameter of 500Å [33]. The SANS spectra from unilamellar vesicles at T=30oC were collected 

at two different spectrometers. 

1. The YuMO time-of-flight spectrometer of the IBR-2 pulsed reactor at the Joint Institute 

for  Nuclear  Research  (JINR),  Dubna,  Russia  [29].  Two  sample-to-detector  distances  were 

used:  4.38m  and  13.70m.  The  spectra  were  normalized  on  the  macroscopic  cross-section  of 

vanadium [34].  

2.  The  SANS  spectrometer  of  the  Swiss  Spallation  Neutron  Source  at  the  Paul  Scherrer 

Institute (PSI), Switzerland. Three sample-to-detector distances were used: 2m, 6m, and 20m. 

Neutron wavelength was 4.7– 0.47Å. The spectra were normalized on the macroscopic cross-

section of H2O.  

4. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION. 

Results  of  fitting  the  DMPC  vesicle  spectrum  of  the  YuMO  spectrometer  are  given  on 

Fig.2 and Table 1. Parameters  R =277 and m=10 were calculated only for the uniform density 

(case  (a)).  They  were  fixed  for  the  cases  (b)  and  (c).  This  approach  reduces  the  number  of 

unknown parameters for a more complex function r (x). We put r

(cid:1) = -

 0.36(cid:215) 1010(cid:0) m-2, S(q)=1, 

IIB =0.00546cm-1.  

The  introduction  of  the  internal  structure  of  the  membrane  containing  hydrophobic  and 

hydrophilic  parts,  leads  to  the  increase  of  the  thickness  of  membrane  on  5.4  Å  (see  variants 

((cid:2) ) and (b) of the Table 1 and Fig.1). The calculated thickness of the hydrophobic part of the 

DMPC  membrane  13.2±0.7  Å  is  in  agreement  with  the  result  for  a  hydrophobic  part  of  the 

POPC  membrane  in  [20]  13±1  Å.  The  calculated  membrane  thickness  42.1±0.4  Å  is  a  little 

smaller  than  the  value  44.2  Å  obtained  in  [27]  from  the  X-ray  diffraction  experiment  at 

multilamellar DMPC vesicles. Our results show that the phospholipid hydrophilic part 14.5 Å 

 

8

(cid:0)
is  significantly  higher  than  the  size  of  its  polar  head  9  Å  [27],  i.e. water molecules penetrate 

into the region of hydrocarbon tails on approximately 5 Å (it corresponds to the length of two 

methylene groups). 

Two variants of the linear water distribution are presented in Table 1: c1 and c2. Variant (cid:0) 2 

corresponds to the case of density plotted on Fig. 1(cid:0)

 by the dashed line. Variant (cid:0) 1 (solid line 

on  Fig.  1c)  shows  a  situation  where  r PH2  =  r D2O = 6.4(cid:215) 1010  (cid:0) m-2.    Both  variants  give  similar 

results; however, the c1 case provides a little smaller value of residual RI.  

From  our  calculation,  one  can  make  a  conclusion  about  water  distribution  inside 

hydrophilic  part  of  the  bilayer.  Let  us  apply  the  results  of  variant  c1  for  estimation  of  the 

number  of  water  molecules  NW  per  one  DMPC  molecule  penetrating  into  the  bilayer. 

Assuming that all water molecules are distributed linearly across the bilayer, value NW can be 

calculated as follows:

where  A  =  59.6  Å2  –  the  membrane  surface  area  per  one  DMPC  molecule  [27],  lD2O  = 

1.914(cid:215) 10-12  (cid:0) m  –  scattering  length  of  D2O  molecule.  One  can  obtain  from  eq.(15)  NW  = 

5.7– 0.3.  This  value  is  smaller  than  value  7.2  obtained  from  the  X-ray  diffraction  on 

multilamellar  vesicles  [27]  and  value  6.8– 0.2  obtained  in  [18]  from  analysis  of  the  same 

SANS  curve  in  the  Guinier  region  of  membrane  and  it  is  in  agreement  with  the  value  7– 2 

calculated from SANS in [17].  

Fitting  results  for  the  spectra  of  the  PSI  SANS  experiment  are  presented  on  Fig.3  and 

Table 2. The fit parameters for three different models of r (x) (Fig.1) were:  R , m, d, D, r (x), 

IIB. It is seen that the values of  R  given in Tables 1 and 2, are in good agreement.  

The  calculation  of  water  quantity  with  linear  distribution  across  the  hydrophilic  part  of 

membrane (Eq.(15)) gives NW =3.9– 0.03. It is smaller than the water molecules number in the 

polar  head  groups  region  obtained  in  [17,18,27].  It  is  a  reasonable  result:  from  molecular

dynamic  simulation,  the  water  distribution  across  the  bilayer  is  more  similar  to  sigmoidal 

function [35]. Only middle part of the sigmoidal function has a linear form. Thus, modeling of 

water distribution across the bilayer gives underestimated value of water molecules.  

As we have already mentioned, at the YuMO experiment data fitting,  R and m were fitted 

only  for  r (x)” const.  On  the  contrary,  in  case  of  the  PSI  SANS  data fitting, the values of  R  

and  m  were  fit  parameters  for  all  the  model  calculations.  It  was  possible  because  the 

experimental  conditions  of  the  PSI  small-angle  spectrometer  are  better  for  the  determination 

of  vesicle  radius:  at  YuMO  spectrometer  qmin=0.0083  Å-1  while  at  PSI  SANS  spectrometer 

qmin=0.0033Å-1.  According  to  the  SFF  model,  the  possibility  to  measure  the  scattering  curve 

in a small value of q is important for the vesicle radius evaluation (see Eq.(8)). That is why  R  

can be directly fitted for all scattering length density models in the case qmin=0.0033Å-1. 

The  relative  standard  deviation  of  vesicle  radius  s =0.30  from  experiment  at  YuMO 

spectrometer  and  s =0.27  from  experiment  at  the  PSI  SANS  spectrometer.  This  small 

difference can arise due to the differences in the value of qmin, accuracy of resolution function 

calculation  and  differences  in  the  samples.  (It  is  important  to  note,  that  two  different  handle 

extrusions at the same conditions cannot produce exactly the same vesicle population.)  

Information  on  the  internal  membrane  structure,  obtained  at  two  different  spectrometers, 

confirms  that  the  calculated  membrane  parameters  strongly  depend  on  the  used  range  of 

scattering  vector  as  was  shown  in  [36,37].  At  the  PSI  SANS  spectrometer,  the  maximum 

value  of  q  corresponds  to  0.56Å-1  (while  the  value  0.2Å-1  at  the  YuMO  spectrometer).  The 

statistical  errors  at  the  end  portion  of  the  scattering  curve  of  the  YuMO  spectrometer  are 

large; in fact, this curve was measured with good statistics only to qmax=0.15Å-1. According to 

the  SFF  model,  the  end  of  scattering  curve  corresponds  to  the  form-factor  of  bilayer  (see 

Eq.(5)).  The  accuracy of restoring the DMPC membrane structure depends on the possibility 

to  collect  the  SANS curve in the region of large values of q, as it was done with PSI SANS 

spectrometer [36,37].

The important parameter is incoherent background IIB. Due to the large value of qmax at the 

PSI SANS spectrometer, this value can be used as a fit parameter. (For the case of the YuMO 

we should estimate this value from the quantity of lipids in the sample.) The calculated values 

are  in  the  range  of  0.0050  –  0.0059  cm-1  and  correspond  to  the  theoretical  value  for  15mM 

DMPC concentration, 0.0055 cm-1.  

The  value  of  membrane  thickness  47.4Å  and  thickness  of  hydrophobic  membrane  part 

17.3Å  from  the  PSI  experiment  exceed  the  corresponding  values  42.5Å  and  11Å  obtained 

from  the  YuMO  experiment.  The  values  of  the  hydrophilic  part  of  DMPC  membrane 

calculated  from  the  PSI  experiment,  15.1Å,  and  from  the  YuMO  experiment,  15.8Å,  are  in 

reasonable  agreement.  The calculated value of DMPC membrane thickness exceeds the value 

44.2Å obtained in [27] from the X-ray diffraction experiment and value of 44.5 obtained from 

SANS in [18].  

5. CONCLUSION 

On  the  basis  of  the  SFF  model,  the  scheme  and  code  of  fitting  the  SANS  spectra  of 

polydispersed  vesicle  population have been developed taking into account a structural factor, 

a spectrometer resolution function, and internal structure of vesicles. 

The accuracy of the vesicle structure fitting depends on the experimentally measured range 

of  the  scattering  vector.  This  means  that  the  restored  parameters  of  the  internal  membrane 

structure depend on the value of q measured experimentally. For the systems under study, the 

best experimental conditions were realized for the PSI SANS spectrometer with possibility to 

collect a scattering curve in the q range from qmin=0.0033Å-1 to qmax=0.56Å-1.  

The  SFF  model  for  the  SANS  data  of  the  PSI  spectrometer  allowed  one  to  calculate 

parameters  of  the  polydispersed  DMPC  vesicle  population:  average  radius  275±0.4  Å, 

polydispersity  27%,  lipid  bilayer  thickness  47.4±0.04Å;  thickness  of  its  hydrophobic  and 

hydrophilic  parts  17.3±0.05  Å  and  15.05±0.09  Å,  respectively.  The  number  of  water 

 

11

molecules per one DMPC molecule, which are linearly distributed across the hydrophilic part, 

is calculated as 3.9– 0.03.

We address basic properties and stability of two-dimensional solitons in photonic lattices 

induced by the nondiffracting Mathieu beams. Such lattices allow for smooth topological 

transformation  of  radially  symmetric  Bessel  lattices  into  quasi-one-dimensional  periodic 

ones. The transformation of lattice topology drastically affects properties of ground-state 

and dipole-mode solitons, including their shape, stability and transverse mobility.

Transverse  variations  of  refractive  index  of  nonlinear  media  drastically  alter  the 

propagation  of  optical  solitons,  which  can  henceforth  be  routed  and  steered.  The 

technique of optical induction, recently introduced in nonlinear optics [1-5], opens broad 

horizons for creation of various transverse refractive index landscapes, or optical lattices. 

Lattices  with  tunable  features  can  be  thus  readily  imprinted  in  suitable  crystals.  The 

basic  properties  of  solitons  supported  by  the  lattice  are  defined  by  its  topology.  Thus, 

domain of soliton existence in simplest periodic lattice, formed by set of plane waves, is 

dictated by the Floquet-Bloch lattice spectrum [1-10]. Another important class of optical 

lattices  can  be  created  by  nondiffracting  Bessel  beams  with  radial  symmetry.  Such 

lattice  symmetry  results  in  new  soliton  features  and  opens  new  ways  for  soliton 

manipulation, including the possibility to induce rotary soliton motions and collisions in 

different lattice rings [11-13], as well as reconfigurable soliton networks [14,15]. 

In  this  Letter  we  study  a  new  type  of  optical  lattice  that  sets  important 

connection between periodic and radially symmetric Bessel lattices. Such lattices can be 

induced by nondiffracting Mathieu beams, and afford smooth topological transformation 

of  radially  symmetric  profile  of  Bessel  lattice  into  quasi-one-dimensional  periodic  one. 

The transformation of the lattice topology finds its manifestation in dramatic change of 

properties of ground-state and dipole-mode solitons.

 Mathieu 

lattices that we consider in this Letter are shown in Fig. 1. For small values of interfocal 

parameter  a

 the foci of associated elliptical coordinate system collapse to a point, 

and even Mathieu lattice transforms into radially symmetric Bessel lattice. Odd Mathieu 

beams produce azimuthally modulated lattices at a

. At a

 when separation of 

the foci tends to infinity, lattice transforms into quasi-one-dimensional periodic pattern. 

Thus, modification of interfocal parameter results in a smooth topological deformation of

 is the real function 

and b  is the propagation constant. Ground-state solitons reside on the central maximum 

of simplest  (

m =

 even Mathieu lattice imprinted in focusing medium. At a

0=

 such 

solitons are radially symmetric. With increase of a  at fixed U  and 

p

 solitons gradually 

become elliptic, their amplitude decreases, and solitons expand over neighboring lattice 

maxima along  ζ -axis. For large  a  values solitons may feature strong modulation along 

ζ

-axis, whose depth increases with increase of lattice depth. Mathieu lattices imprinted 

in focusing medium support dipole-mode solitons whose field changes sign between two 

central lattice maximums (below we consider such solitons in odd lattices with  m

1=

). 

Lattices in defocusing medium support specific solitons that can be termed gap solitons. 

Localization mechanism for such solitons in  ζ -direction (where lattice is almost periodic 

for  a

1(cid:21)

) is of Bragg type, while confinement in 

η

 is achieved because of appropriate 

refractive compensation of diffraction and defocusing. In-phase combinations of such gap 

solitons are also possible (Fig. 2). 

Transformation  of  lattice  topology  substantially  affects  solitons  stability. 

Properties of ground-state solitons at 

σ =

−

1

 are summarized in Fig. 3. At small values 

of 

a

, the energy flow monotonically increases with  b  (Fig. 3(a)). Energy flow vanishes 

in the cutoff on  b  that increases with lattice depth 

p

 and interfocal parameter  a  (Fig. 

3(b)).  With  increase  of  b ,  solitons  get  narrower,  their  amplitude  increases,  and  their 

energy  flow  asymptotically  approaches  U

≈

  that  corresponds  to  energy  flow  of

  soliton  peak

≈

5.23

,  while  at  b

=

7.5

  peak  amplitude  reaches  6.22  and 

U

≈

5.69

.  At  a  given  critical  value  of  a ,  a  branch  with  negative  dU

/db

  appears. 

According to the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) criterion this branch corresponds to unstable 

solitons.  Solitons  belonging  to  this  branch  expand  over  many  lattice  periods  in  ζ  

direction (Fig. 2) that results in increase of U  with decrease of  b , so that energy flow 

becomes a two-valued function of b . Such soliton expansion in the small amplitude limit 

is  consistent  with  the  fact  that  linear  guided  modes  of  Mathieu  lattices  for  large  a  

approach  delocalized  Bloch  modes  of  quasi-one-dimensional  periodic  patterns.  In 

 

3

contrast, at  a

1(cid:19)

 low-amplitude solitons transform into linear guided modes of almost 

radially  symmetric  lattice,  which  are  always  well  localized.  The  instability  domain  for 

ground-state  soliton  broadens  with  a   (Fig.  3(c)).  Direct  stability  analysis  performed 

with  Eq.  (1),  linearized  around  perturbed  stationary  solution  w

( , )η ζ

,  confirmed 

conclusions  based  on  the  VK  criterion.  Instability  of  ground-state  soliton  in  Mathieu 

lattice at a

1(cid:21)

 is associated with exponentially growing perturbation (Fig. 3(d)). 

The topology of Mathieu lattice has even stronger impact on properties of dipole-

mode solitons. The energy flow of such solitons increases monotonically with b  at small 

a

 (Fig. 4(a)). Energy flow vanishes in the cutoff, where solitons broadens substantially. 

For  high  enough  a   soliton  ceases  to  exist  in  the  cutoff  without  any  topological  shape 

transformation. This behavior finds its manifestation in the discontinuity of dependence 

of  cutoff  on  interfocal  parameter  (Fig.  4(b)).  With  growth  of  b   dipole-mode  soliton 

transforms  into  two  narrow  weakly  interacting  out-of-phase  solitons.  Stability  analysis 

revealed  that  dipole-mode  solitons  become  stable  above  a  threshold  on  propagation 

constant  (or U )  similarly  to  their  counterparts  in  two-dimensional  periodic  lattices  [8] 

(Fig.  4(c)).  Dipole-mode  solitons  suffer  oscillatory  instabilities  associated  with  complex 

growth  rates.  Importantly,  we  found  that  the  threshold  value  of  propagation  constant 

for stabilization quickly increases with  a , upon transformation of lattice into quasi-one-

dimensional one, so that at  a

→ ∞

 dipole-mode solitons become unstable in the entire 

domain of their existence. This shows the drastic difference between stability properties 

of  dipole-mode  solitons  in  quasi-one-dimensional  and  two-dimensional  lattices,  which 

always  supports  stable  dipole-mode  solitons.  Gap  solitons  and  their  in-phase 

combinations depicted in Fig. 2 can also be made stable in Mathieu lattices. 

The transformation of the lattice topology with increase of a  substantially affects 

soliton mobility. Solitons are strongly pinned by almost radially symmetric lattices with 

small 

a

,  and  can  hardly  jump  into  neighboring  lattice  rings.  In  contrast,  quasi-one-

dimensional lattices with large a  feature pronounced channels along  η -axis, so that even 

small  input  tilts  cause  considerable  transverse  displacements  (periodic  oscillations)  of 

both  ground-state  and  dipole-mode  solitons  (Fig.  4(d)).  The  amplitude  of  these 

oscillations increases with  a  for a given input tilt. Notice also the possibility to induce 

rotary motions in lowest-order even Mathieu lattices with small interfocal parameters.

Summarizing,  we  analyzed  properties  of  solitons  supported  by  Mathieu  lattices, 

that  sets  important  connection  between  radially  symmetric  and  quasi-one-dimensional 

periodic lattices. We showed how lattice topology affects basic properties of ground-state 

and dipole-mode solitons including their stability, and mobility in transverse plane.

ABSTRACT

Model And Results

A  continuum  one-dimensional  model  of  the  plane  Couette-Poiseuille  flow  is  developed  to  describe  the
pressure  distribution  in  a  drag  stage  of  molecular  pump  of  either  the  Gaede  or  Holweck  type.  In  spite  of  its
simplicity  and  approximate  nature  the  model  provides  a  good  qualitative  representation  of  the  drag  pump
operation in the whole range of the regimes from the continuum to free molecular ones.

The steady Couette-Poiseuille flow in a long plane channel between two plates with equal temperatures  T ,
one  of  which  is  moving  with  the  velocity  w   is  described  in  the  frames  of  the  boundary  layer  equation

The calculations show that for conditions typical of modern drag pumps the contribution of inertial term is
small. Neglecting this term simplifies the governing equation to the form 
 that for some shapes of the
channel  allows  analytical  solution.  Thus  for  the  channel  of  constant  cross  section  δ   and  L   in  length  the

The relation (1) describes the distribution of pressure 

 inside the channel treating the length  L  as the
variable. This relation predicts reasonable results for all the regimes from the continuum to free molecular ones.
From the analysis of this relation and the results for tapered channel

The model can provide not only a qualitative description of the drag pump operation but also a quantitative
one. For this purpose the accommodation coefficient  σ should be treated as a fitting parameter which value is
to  be  derived  from  the  compression  ratio  of  the  pump  in  the  free  molecular  regime.  Figure  1  illustrates  the
description of experimental results [3] (symbols) obtained for the Holweck pump. The predictions of the model
shown by solid lines are obtained for 

6.0=σ

.

In  spite  of  its  simplicity  and  approximate  nature  the  developed  model  provides  a  good  qualitative
representation of the pumping process in the drag molecular pump in the whole range of the regimes from the
continuum  to  free  molecular  ones.  The  possibility  of  quantitative  description  of  the  experimental  results
indicates that the model may be applied to optimize the design of the real pump, though the main purpose of the
model consists in better understanding the basic features of the flow.

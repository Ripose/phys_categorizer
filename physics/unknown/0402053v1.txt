Abstract

We  used  computer  simulation  to  calculate  the  electric  dipole  moments  of  the  α  and  β
tubulin  monomers  and  dimer  and  found  those  to  be  |pα|=552D,  |pβ|=1193D  and  |pαβ|=1740D
respectively. Independent surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and refractometry measurements of
the high-frequency dielectric constant and polarizability strongly corroborated our previous SPR-
derived results giving ∆n/∆c ~1.800x10-3 ml/mg. The refractive index of tubulin was measured to
be  ntub  ~2.90  and  the  high  frequency  tubulin  dielectric  constant  κtub  ~8.41  while  the  high-
frequency polarizability was found to be αtub ~ 2.1x 10-33 C m2/V. Methods for the experimental
determination of the low-frequency p are explored as well as ways to test the often conjectured
quantum  coherence  and  entanglement  properties  of  tubulin.  Biobits,  bioqubits  and  other
applications to bioelectronics are discussed.

Introduction

Although the structure of tubulin, the building block of microtubules (MTs) has been solved

by electron crystallography to better than 3.7¯, [1, 2], its electric dipole moment has only been

calculated via computer simulations including the ones presented here and in [3].

Knowledge  of  the  tubulin  electric  dipole  moment  will  be  useful  in  studies  of  MT

(de)polymerization  dynamics,  simulations  of  MTs  as  cellular  automata  and  the  experimental

testing  of  hypotheses  suggesting  quantum  behavior,  as  it  can  be  incorporated  in  the  various

models  as  an  experimentally  determined  parameter.  Furthermore,  it  may  help  in  understanding

whether and how to use tubulin self-assembly in novel biomaterial nanofabication applications.

This communication is divided into eight sections. Section 1 gives a short overview of the

field. Section 2 presents our computer simulation results for the electric dipole moment and other

geometric and energetic properties of the tubulin dimer and monomers. In Section 3, we report on

our  surface  plasmon  resonance  (SPR)  and  refractometry  measurements  of  the  high-frequency

dielectric constant  and polarizability of tubulin in solution. Section 4  describes several possible

avenues  to  the  experimental  determination  of  the  low-frequency  dipole  moment.  Section  5

suggests experimental tests of the often-conjectured ability of tubulin dimers to sustain coherent

and/or entangled ’dipole quanta’ states [4]. Section 6  discusses the implications for biomolecular

electronics while sections 7 and 8 provide a summary of obtained results and conclusions.

1.1

Significance and Possible Roles of Tubulin Dipole Moment

There  have  been  some  preliminary  experiments  showing  MTs  are  birefringent  [5]  and

others  aimed  at  measuring  the  electric  field  around  MTs  [6,7,8]  indicating  that  MTs  could  be

ferroelectric (i.e. spontaneous abrupt orientation of tubulin dipoles occurs for an above-threshold

2

externally applied electric field). Some work on the optical properties of MTs appeared in [9,10].

Work by members of this group has concentrated on investigating the  effects of MT disruption

(by expressing vertebrate microtubule-associated protein (MAP)-tau in mushroom body neurons

of  (cid:150)invertebrate-  Drosophila  fruitflies)  on  the  associative  memory  of  these  animals.  We  have

concluded that even a small disruption in the microtubular network of neurons causes animals to

lose their ability to form and retain associative memories [11] thus supporting hypotheses of MT

involvement  in  memory function.  Apart  from the  above  experimental  observations, there exists

little experimental evidence concerning the  electrical  or  often  mentioned  quantum  properties of

tubulin  and  MTs  and  how  these  affect/effect  their  function.  On  the  other  hand,  there  is  a  large

amount  of  theoretical  work  describing  various  electrical,  optical  and  quantum  properties  that

tubulin  and  MTs  are  expected  to  have  based  upon  their  structure  and  function.  Ferroelectricity

has  been  supported  by  the  analysis  in  [12].  Drug  interactions  with  tubulin  have  been  under

investigation  and  it  has  been  theorized  that  electric  dipole  moment  ’flips’  are  responsible  for

attractive  London  forces  during  tubulin  binding  to  other  molecules  also  possessing  dipole

moments such as general  anesthetics  [13].  There is  controversy as  to  the  correct mechanism of

polymerization with the (cid:147)GTP cap(cid:148) theory [14] facing alternatives such as those described in [15]

and the size of the minimum nucleus required to start polymerization is not clearly understood.

The MT paracrystalline geometrical structure has been implicated in error-correcting codes [16].

Intracellular  loss-free  energy  transport  along  MTs  via  ’solitonic  kink  like  excitations’  or  ’dipole

quanta’  has  been  theoretically  described  in  [4,17].  In  addition  to  the  above  mentioned  wave

phenomena (collectivelly such waves of tubulin dipole moment flips will be called ’flip waves’)

all of the microtubule-based ’quantum brain’ models that abound today [4,18,19,20,21,22] have at

their core the assumption that tubulin is capable of some sort of conformational changes while in

the  polymerized  state.  Note  that  this  applies  even  to  the  more  exotic  models  of  [19,20]  that

3

involve  quantum  effects  arising  from  the  difference  in  the  gravitational  states  of  two  tubulin

conformations,  since  the  geometrical  shifts  between  the  monomers  are  unlikely  to  leave  the

dipole  moment  vector  unchanged.  Starting  from  such  assumptions,  predictions  have  been

developed  such  as  the  existence  of  long-lived  superposed  and  entangled  states  among  tubulin

dimers and long-range non-neurotransmitter based communication among neurons [16,17,18,21].

Further, interaction between water molecule dipoles and the tubulin dipole plays a central role in

models  predicting  emission  of  coherent  photons  from  MTs[22],  intracellular  quantum

teleportation of dipole quanta states [18] and other controversial yet fascinating features[21].

Today(cid:146)s  conventional  silicon  based  devices  are  of  order  180nm  in  size  while  future

molecular devices promise a further order of magnitude reduction to this minimum. As a result,

there  have  been  considerable  efforts  concentrated  on  identifying  various  chemical  substances

with appropriate characteristics to act as binary switches and logic gates. For instance, rotaxanes

have  been  considered  as  switches/fuses  [23]  and  carbon  nanotubes  as  active  channels  in  field

effect transistors [24]. Many of these substances are unsuitable for placement on traditional chips

[25] or for forming networks, while virtually all of these efforts attempt to hybridize some kind

of electrical wires to chemical substrates  in  order  to  obtain  current  flows.  This  complicates  the

task because of the need for appropriately nanomanufactured wires and connections.

Here we propose an alternative approach. Instead of the binary states being determined by

the  presence  or  bulk  movement  of  electrons,  they  can  be  defined  in  terms  of  the  naturally

occurring conformational (and consequently dipole moment) states of tubulin or similar  protein

molecules and their self-assembled polymers. Moreover, the external interaction with these states

can be performed by coupling laser light to specific spots of a polymer network. In the case of

MTs, signal propagation may be achieved via travelling electric dipole moment ’flip waves’ along

MTs  while  modulation  may  be  performed  by  MAP  binding  that  creates  (cid:147)nodes(cid:148)  in  the  MT

4

network.  In  this  proposed  scheme  for  information  manipulation,  there  is  no  bulk  transfer  of

(charged)  mass  involved.  Tubulin  polymerization  can  be  controlled  by  temperature  and

application of chemicals and MAPs to yield closely or widely spaced MTs, centers, sheets, rings

and other structures [26,27], thus  facilitating  fabrication of  nanowires, nodes  and  networks  and

even  structures  capable  of  long-term  information  storage  (biomolecular  computer  memory).

Since MTs are polar, algnment can be achieved by application of dc electric fields.

Many of these theoretical studies and proposals will be facilitated by  a determination of

the electric dipole moment of  tubulin  and  its  dynamics  as  this  property  features  prominently  in

the underlying models.

1.2 

Properties of Tubulin and Microtubules

Under  normal  physiological  conditions,  tubulin  is  found  as  a  heterodimer,  consisting  of

two nearly identical monomers: α- and β- tubulin, each of molecular weight of about 55kDalton

[2]. Electron crystallography measurements on zinc-induced tubulin protofilament sheets [1] have

shown  that  the  tubulin  heterodimer  has  dimensions  46x80x65  ¯  [Fig.  1  (b)]  and  a  3.7  ¯

resolution atomic map has been made available in the public [28]. The β- tubulin monomer can

bind guanosine 5(cid:146) triphosphate (GTP), in which case it exists in an energy-rich form that favors

polymerization (self assembly), or it can bind guanosine 5(cid:146) diphosphate (GDP-tubulin) thus being

in an energy-poor form (GDP-tubulin) that favors dissociation.

Figure 1: Tubulin and Microtubule. Tubulin is a common polar protein found mainly in
the  cytoskeleton  of  eukariotic  cells  and  especially  enriched  in  brain  and  neural  tissue.  MTs  are
hollow  (25nm-outer  diameter,  14nm  inner  diameter),  tubes  forming  the  main  component  of  the
cytoskeleton  and  apart  from  giving  shape  and  support  to  the  cell,  they  also  play  a  major  role  in
cellular transport, have been hypothesized to be central in cellular information processing [41] and
suggested as possible candidates for biological and/or quantum computation. (a) A typical neuronal

quantum optical (QED) cavity[4].

Certain  interesting  phenomena  arise  during  the  (de-)polymerization  of  tubulin  such  as

length oscillations, treadmilling etc. generally referred to as (cid:145)dynamic instability(cid:146). These effects

have been studied extensively [29,30] but are not directly relevant to our analysis at this stage as

such  phenomena  can  be  avoided  during  in  vitro  experiments  by  choosing  appropriate  buffer

environments  e.g.  adding  chemicals  such  as  taxol  or  glycerol  that  stabilize  microtubules  in  the

polymerized  state.  The  GDP-GTP  exchange  (hydrolysis)  releases  ~0.4eV  per  molecule  and  is

accompanied by a conformational change [10]. This change has been modeled as  resulting in  a

~27o angle [31] between the original line connecting the centers of the α- and β- monomers and

the new center-to-center line [Fig. 1 (d)].

MTs come in a variety of arrangements the predominant of which is a 5-start, period-13

helical  tube  of  dimers  which  resembles  a  corn  ear  [Fig.1  (a)]  made  out  of  13  offset

protofilaments. At physiological pH (=7.2) MTs are negatively charged [32] due to the presence

of  a  15-residue  carboxyl  terminus  (cid:145)tail(cid:146)  and  at  pH=5.6  MTs  become  neutral.  There  have  been

suggestions  that  the  C-terminus  [see  Fig.  1  (e)]  is  important  in  polymerization,  protein

interactions  and  perhaps  charge  conduction  [33].  This  terminus  has  not  been  included  in  the

electron  crystallography  data  of  [2]  so  all  values  concerning  the  dipole  moment  vector  p  are

quoted with the understanding that p has been calculated ignoring the effect of the  C-terminus.

This necessary approximation is partially warranted because of the symmetrical nature of the C-

terminus  tails  extending  outward  from  the  MT  trunk  and  conceivably  canceling  each  other(cid:146)s

electrostatic contribution at least at the MT interior [see Fig.1 (f)].

Computer Simulation

A  na(cid:239)ve  estimate  of  the  tubulin  dipole  moment  p  in  vacuum  based  on  a  charge  of  10

electrons multiplied by a separation of 4nm (roughly the distance between the monomers) yields

an  |p|  of  1920D.  Similarly,  a  rough  volume  estimate  is  V  =    2Vglob  where  Vglob  refers  to  the

approximately spherical volume of each globular monomer of radius R≈26 ¯ so that Vglob=4/3πR3

≈73,600 ¯3. The TINKER V3.9 (2001) molecular modeling package [34,35] was applied with the

CHARMM  set  of  force-field  parameters  [36]  to  the  1TUB  protein  database  data  (pdb)  [28]

consisting of some 17,000 atomic coordinates and we calculated |p| to be 1740D for the tubulin

dimer in close agreement with previous molecular simulation calculations [36].

TINKER with CHARMM parameters has given close matches to experimental values for

dipole  moments  of  other  molecules  [3],  so  we  expect  the  above  quoted  |pαβ|=1740D  to  be

reasonably close to the real value of the dipole for the crystallized tubulin unit cell in a flat sheet

of antiparallel zinc-induced protofilaments, without C-termini,   (as these  were  the experimental

conditions for the pdb data). It was also found that the dipole moment of the individual α- and β-

monomers  to  be  |pα|=552D  and  |pβ|=1193D  respectively.  Note  that  the  β-monomer  has

approximately  twice  the  dipole  moment  vector  magnitude  of  the  α-monomer  and  both  point  in

virtually the same direction, consistent with the fact that they have nearly identical sequence and

tertiary  structure.  The  minimum  volume  we  calculated  using  pdb  data  was  V≈78,000  ¯3.  As

expected, the Van der Waals attractive forces constitute the maximum contribution to the energy

of the tubulin molecule.

Experimental Methods and Results

3.1

High frequency tubulin dielectric constant and polarizability determination.

The dipole moment is intimately related to the dielectric constant κ through:

P = (κ-1) εoE

where P is the total polarization of a sample, κ = ε /εo (where ε is the permittivity of the material

and  εo  the  permittivity  of  vacuum)  and  E  is  the  local  electric  field  vector.  Therefore  as  a

preliminary step to the eventual electric dipole moment determination, we reported in [38] on our

SPR-based measurement of the slope of the refractive index n versus concentration c straight line

for tubulin:

Note that for optical frequencies, the dielectric constant is related to the refractive index n via

   (2)

Here we corroborate this result with a refractometry measurement as follows. We used a

commercial  refractometer  [Abbe  Refractometer,  Vista  C10]  of  exceptional  accuracy.  Briefly,

light  was  allowed  to  enter  and  be  reflected  into  a  prism,  which  was  coated  with  the  sample  of

interest and covered. The prism’s refractive index was known and the beam’s incident angle was

tilted  until  total  internal  reflection  was  reached  (seen  as  a  dark  band  in  the  eyepiece).  The

refractive index of the sample was then read on a pre-calibrated scale. This method depends on

the prism having a higher refractive index than the sample. After standard calibration and prior to

measurement  of  tubulin  solutions,  a  number  of  NaCl  solutions  of  varying  concentration  were

used  as  additional  calibration  (data  not  shown).  Determining  the  exact  concentration  was  the

main source of error in this measurement so high precision electronic scales and precision micro

11

pipettes were used. The  prism  was  cleaned after  each  measurement  with  ethanol  soaked  cotton

and  left  to  dry  before  applying  the  next  sample.  It  was  found  that  30-50(cid:181)L  of  solution  were

adequate to deposit a thin film on the prism such that there was virtually no noise (indicated as

colors).  This  small  volume  is  comparable  to  the  requirements  of  the  sophisticated  SPR-based

BIAcore 3000 [39] machine for a single injection.

The refractive indices of a series of concentrations of NaCl (in 18.1MΩ H2O) and tubulin in

the  same  buffer  as  for  the  SPR  measurement  (0.1M  4-Morpholinoethane  sulphonic  acid,  1mM

EGTA,  0.1mM  EDTA,  0.5mMMgCl2,  1mM  GTP  at  pH  6.4)  were  measured.  Three

measurements were taken for each data point. Errors are estimated at ~5% for concentration (see

Fig. 3). The precision of the refractometer was scale limited with an error of 0.00005 for n (not

shown, represented as the size of the data points). In Figure 3 a least-squares fit linear regression

yields straight lines with an R factor of 0.9928. The intercepts were manually set to the zero-point

concentration averages. The results at different times (i.e. pre- and post-polymerization) did not

deviate  appreciably  suggesting  that  at  this  wavelength  range,  solutions  of  tubulin  dimers  and

microtubules have similar refractive indices.

12

Figure 3. Refractive Index VS Tubulin Concentration.

A  very  small  change  in  concentration  of  tubulin  results  in  a  significant  change  in  the

index of refraction (Fig. 3) giving a slope of ∆n/∆C = 1.800 – 0.090 x10-3 ml/mg (this result is

strongly corroborated by our previous SPR measurement -equation (1): ∆n/∆C 1.80 – 0.20x10-3).

A physiological concentration is assumed to be 15.0(cid:181)M (i.e. 1.50x10-5 mol/L) [40]. Since the

molecular weight of a tubulin dimer is 110kD this gives a proportionality of 1.00mg/mL ~ 9.10

(cid:181)M i.e. 15.0(cid:181)M is equivalent to 1.60mg/mL. This results in a molecular density of N = 9.03x1018

tubulin molecules per liter or 9.03x1021 m-3, but the concentration necessarily varies across cell

types, intracellular position and cell condition. For instance, although a MAP-tau-burdened cell

has  the  same  overall  tubulin  density,  it  has  much  higher  local  axonal  and  dendritic  density  of

tubulin  when  MTs  have  deteriorated  into  neurofibrillary  tangles  as  is  the  case  in  Alzheimer’s

Disease.

The partial contribution to the refractive index of the solution by tubulin can be found if

the density dependence on concentration of the solution is known (see Fig. 3). Assuming that the

contributions from the various components  are  additive linearly, we  have  for  the  total  index  of

Where χtub = Ctub /ρ the mass fraction and ρ is the density of the solution. It may be argued that

using a volume fraction is more appropriate here but for our purposes a mass fraction is adequate

and simpler. At Ctub = 1.60mg/mL,  nsol = 1.8000x10-3Ctub +1.3352 (from Fig. 3) gives: nsol = 1.34

– 0.07 and using solution density ρ=1.45gr/mL[41], at Ctub=1.60mg/mL we arrive at the value for

ntub:

ntub = 2.90 – 0.10 ,

κtub = 8.41–0.20 .

which can be used in  κ = n2 to give the high frequency tubulin dielectric constant:

(3)

(4)

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  time  these  two  quantities  have  been  experimentally

determined for tubulin.

Both n and κ are at the very top range of what is usually assumed for proteins, as expected

since tubulin seems to have such a high dipole moment in molecular dynamics simulations.

The  refractive  index  n  of  an  optically  dense  material  is  related  to  the  high  frequency

A very large number owing to the evidently large dipole moment of tubulin.

A  determination  of  the  high-frequency  electric  dipole  moment  p  from  α  is  now  possible

through the approximation p = pperm +  α Eloc  where Eloc  is the local incident field and pperm is the

permanent or low-frequency "dc-" dipole moment that was earlier calculated by simulation to be

of  the  order  of  1700D.  Next  we  will  suggest  several  ways  of  experimentally  determining  this

low-frequency or dc- p.

Suggestions for the experimental determination of  the low-frequency electric dipole

moment of tubulin

4.1

In vacuum

Although the most direct approach to determine the electric dipole moment of a protein

such  as  tubulin  would  be  to  measure  the  acceleration  of  evaporated  single  molecules  in  the

gradient  of  an  electric  field  in  vacuum,  this  proves  to  be  a  difficult  task.  Even  though  it  is

possible  to  keep  tubulin  from  polymerizing  in  solution  (e.g.  by  lowering  the  temperature  or

raising  the  salinity),  evaporating  individual  tubulin  molecules  is  very  difficult  due  to  tubulin’s

affinity towards polymerization and aggregation. In other words, the protein is naturally ’sticky’

and  will  be  hard  to  corpusculize.  In  addition,  any  spraying  of  this  large  molecule  is  bound  to

break it into its constituent peptides.  Furthermore the tubulin electric dipole moment in vacuum

is not directly relevant to its physiological value, since ionic influences in solution significantly

influence the charge distribution.

4.2

DC Measurement of ε in Dilute Solution

In principle, the capacitance C of a flow cell with conducting parallel-plate walls can be

measured first filled with air and then filled with the tubulin-buffer solution for various tubulin

concentrations. Resistance R1 is assumed to be infinite in the case of air and some finite but very

large value (of the order of 10MΩ) in the case of solution. R2 is set to a well known value (e.g.

5kΩ) and is needed to overwhelm any small conductance due to the presence of liquid between

the plates so that the equivalent resistance in the circuit is identical for all the measurements. An

inductance-resistance-capacitance  (LRC)  bridge  can  be  used  to  perform  the  measurement  at

several low to medium frequencies (e.g. 100Hz to 1kHz) by measuring the RC time constant and

16

the total equivalent resistance and  capacitance  for  the  circuit.  The  ratio C’/C  for  the  tubulin/air

capacitances then gives κ and from equation (4) the dipole moment can be inferred. However, we

have determined that this simple RC circuit with low inductance connected to a bridge is not ideal

because  aqueous  solutions  tend  to  form  time-dependent  polarization  layers  on  the  electrodes

complicating interpretation of the frequency dependence of results [42]. A refined version of this

experiment  based  on  our  ongoing  efforts  at  dielectric  spectroscopy  measurements  will  be

reported elsewhere.

Suggestions for the Experimental Determination of Possible Quantum Effects in

Tubulin

5.1

Tubulin and Quantum Coherence

In [4], a comprehensive model conjecture treating certain regions inside MTs as isolated

high-Q(uality) QED cavities was put forth as well as a scenario according to which the presence

of  ordered  water  in  the  interior  of  MTs  results  in  the  appearance  of  electric  dipole  quantum

coherent modes, which couple to the unpaired electrons of the MT dimers via Rabi vacuum field

couplings. The situation is analogous to the physics of Rydberg atoms in electromagnetic cavities

[43].  In  quantum  optics,  such  couplings  may  be  considered  as  experimental  proof  of  the

quantized  nature  of  the  electromagnetic  radiation.  In  our  case,  therefore,  if  experimentally

detected,  such  couplings  would  indicate  the  existence  of  coherent  quantum  modes  of  electric

dipole quanta in the ordered water environment of MT, as conjectured in [44,45], and used here.

To experimentally verify such a situation, one must first try to detect the emergent ferroelectric

properties of MTs, which are predicted by this model and are potentially observable and for this

measurement of the dipole moment of the tubulin dimer is an important step. A suggestion along

these  lines  has  been  put  forward  in  [12].  In  addition,  one  should  verify  the  aforementioned

vacuum  field  Rabi  coupling  (VFRS),  λMT,  between  the  MT  dimers  and  the  ordered  water

quantum coherent modes. The existence of this coupling  could  be  tested  experimentally  by  the

same methods used to measure VFRS in atomic physics [46], i.e. by using the MTs themselves as

cavity  environments  and  considering  tunable  probes  to  excite  the  coupled  dimer-water  system.

Such  probes  could  be  pulses  of  (monochromatic)  light  coupling  to  MTs.  This  would  be  the

analogue of an external field in the atomic experiments mentioned above. The field would then

resonate,  not  at  the  bare  frequencies  of  the  coherent  dipole  quanta  or  dimers,  but  at  the  Rabi

19

splitted ones, leading to a double peak in the absorption spectra of the dimers [46]. By using MTs

of  different  sizes  one  could  thus  check  on  the  characteristic  √N-enhancement  of  the  (resonant)

Rabi coupling: Ω= ωo–λ√N as described in [4] for MT systems with N dimers.

5.2

Tubulin and Quantum Entanglement

The obvious objection to suggestions of long decoherence times for quantum properties of

large molecules at room temperature comes from the application of equilibrium principles to the

quantum  mechanical  aspects  of  the  constituent  atoms  [47].  A  ground-breaking  experiment  has

recently been performed and showed the existence of long-lived (t ~ 0.5ms) partially entangled

states of the bulk spin of two macroscopically separated samples of 1012 Cesium atoms at room

temperature  [51].  We  hope  to  investigate  deeper,  as  although  the  tubulin  molecule  consists  of

some 17,000 atoms which are subject to considerable thermal noise, the electric dipole moment

state  depends  crucially  on  only  a  few  electrons  that  can  be  in  two  sets  of  orbitals.  In  addition,

tubulin  in  vivo  is  not  an  equilibrium  system,  rather  it  is  a  dynamic  dissipative  system  where

energy  is  being  pumped  in  and  out  constantly.  Our  theoretical  work  has  suggested  that  for  a

certain  set  of  parameters  (such  as  the  value  of  the  dipole  moment,  the  pH  etc.)  tubulin  could

indeed sustain a quantum mechanically coherent state for times of the order of microseconds [4].

Since 1935 when Erwin Schroedinger coined the word "entanglement" to refer to a state

where the wavefunction describing a system is unfactorizable, much has been learned about this

peculiar  phenomenon  and  it  has  turned  out  to  be  very  useful  in  quantum  information  science,

quantum  cryptography  and  quantum  teleportation.  Entanglement  has  been  experimentally

realized in light [48,49], in matter [50] and in combinations of those [51,52]. One way to produce

entangled  states  in  light  is  via  type  II  phase-matching  parametric  downconversion  which  is  a

process occurring when ultraviolet (UV) laser light is incident on a non-linear beta-barium borate

20

(BBO) crystal at specific angles. A UV photon incident on a BBO crystal can, sometimes, due to

a  non-linear  parametric  process,  spontaneously  split  into  two  correlated  infrared  (IR)  photons

(each  of  half  the  energy  of  the  incident  photon).  The  infrared  photons  are  then  emitted  on

opposite  sides  of  the  UV  pump  beam,  along  two  cones,  one  of  which  is  horizontally  polarized

and the other vertically. The photon pairs that are emitted along the intersections of the two cones

have  their  polarization  states  entangled.  This  results  in  each  photon  being  arbitrarily  polarized,

but  the  two  photons  belonging  to  a  pair  necessarily  have  perpendicular  polarizations  to  each

other. The state Ψ of the outgoing entangled photons can be written as: 

)
(
+↔=Ψ
b

,

αie

(
,
b

)↔

where the arrows indicate polarizations for the (first, second) IR photon and can be controlled by

inserting appropriate half wave plates, while the phase factor eiα can be controlled by tilting the

crystal or using an additional BBO in a setup similar to the one depicted in Fig. 5, modified from

[53]

Figure  5.  Type  II  Phase  Matching  Parametric  Downconversion.  For  certain  orientations,  a

UV photon is converted by the non-linear BBO crystal into two entangled IR photons (IR1, IR2)

21

Measuring the state of one of the outgoing photons -say IR1, immediately determines the state of

the  other  (IR2)  regardless  of  their  separation  in  space.  This  counterintuitive  phenomenon  is

referred to as the Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR)-paradox and such pairs are called EPR pairs.

An  on-demand  entangled  photon  source  (ODEPS)  can  be  built  and  utilized  to  do

spectroscopic analysis of proteins and other biomolecules. Such a device would greatly facilitate

studies of the fundamental quantum properties of entangled objects, possible quantum properties

of living matter, quantum information science and more. It would also provide an opportunity to

test and identify the problems associated with the construction of a portable entanglement source

to  be  taken  "into  the  field"  if  and  when  entangled  photons  become  indispensable  to  secure

communications.  For  instance,  tolerances  of  entangled  photon  generation  to  vibration  and

temperature changes could be studied.

5.3

ODEPS/SPR Determination of Conjectured Quantum Nature of Tubulin.

A recent experiment titled "plasmon-assisted transmission of entangled photons" [54] has

shown  that  originally  entangled  photons  stay  entangled  after  being  converted  to  (entangled)

surface plasmons and back, at room temperature.

A minimally modified design of an SPR biosensor apparatus such as the one used in our

measurement  of  ∆n/∆c  in  [38]  coupled  to  an  ODEPS  described  in  section  5.2  above,  could  be

capable  of  detecting  the  often  conjectured  mesoscopic  bulk  coherence  and  partial  quantum

entanglement  of  electric  dipole  moment  states,  existence  of  which  would  cast  biomolecules  as

serious candidates for the implementation of qubits.

The experiment can be performed as follows. Under a protocol similar to one developed

by Oberparleiter et al. [55], a source producing in excess of 360,000 entangled photon pairs per

second, can be coupled to a setup similar to the one developed by Altewischer et al. [54] where

22

entangled  photons  are  transduced  into  (entangled)  surface  plasmons  and  re-radiated  back  as

entangled photons. The essential difference  would  be  that  the  insides  of  the  perforations  in  the

gold  film  of  Altewischer  et  al.  would  be  covered  with  a  monolayer  of  tubulin  dimers  or

microtubules  immobilized  by  standard  methods  similar  to  the  ones  described  in  [38].  The

evanescent wave of the (entangled) surface plasmon generated at resonance will interact with the

electric  dipole  moment  of  the  immobilized  protein  complexes  and  presumably  transfer  the

entanglement  to  a  dipole  state  in  a  manner  similar  to  the  transfer  of  the  photon  polarization

entanglement to surface plasmons.

At the other end of the perforations, the surface plasmons would be reradiated as photons

having  undergone  the  interaction  with  the  protein  electric  dipole  moment.  If  (partial)

entanglement with the partner photon (that underwent none of these transductions) is found, then

this would suggest that the protein is capable of partially "storing" the entanglement in its electric

dipole  moment  state  and  characteristic  decoherence  times  could  be  determined.  Note  that  this

measurement is capable of directly testing the hypothesis of [13] that general anesthetics act by

shutting down such electrical and entanglement activities in MTs since application of anesthetic

gas should presumably destroy any entanglement survival.

Discussion

. It is conceivable that the role of the ubiquitous binary state necessary  for computation

can  be  decoupled  from  the  presence  or  bulk  movement  of  charge  if  one  can  assign  it  to  the

naturally-occurring  conformational  states  of  protein  molecules.  This  scheme  would  be

qualitatively  similar  to  efforts  in  the  new  field  of  spintronics  where  the  spin-polarization  of

electrons  inside  modified  semiconductor-based  logic  gates  is  the  defining  quantity  for  electron

dynamics and switching [56].

Regardless  of  whether  it  turns  out  that  tubulin  and  MTs  are  purely  classical  systems  or

they have a quantum nature, the excitation and detection of the theory-suggested ’flip waves’ [18]

would  be  an  important  step  towards  understanding  the  role  that  tubulin  and  MTs  can  play  as

binary  switches  and  networks  respectively,  both  in  naturally  occurring  systems  such  as  living

cells  as  well  as  in  synthesized  structures.  Note  that  the  energy  needed  for  a  tubulin

conformational  change  or  ’flip’  is  roughly  200  times  lower  than  a  conventional  silicon-based

binary switch, making laser-pulse induced switching feasible. This conformational change energy

is  also  about  30  times  larger  than  thermal  noise  at  room  temperature,  making  the  system

reasonably  resilient  to  thermal  noise.  Certain  structures  other  than  straight  MTs,  for  instance

single and double rings, sheets, spirals, centers etc. can also be induced to self-assemble by using

well-understood  biochemical  protocols  and  we  expect  these  to  eventually  play  distinct  roles  in

building microelectronic components. Note that although biochemically it seems MTs are made

predominantly  of  GDP-tubulin,  this  does  not  mean  that  the  dipole  flips  are  (cid:145)frozen-out(cid:146)  since

intramolecular  electron  motion  can  still  occur  in  the  hydrophobic  pockets  of  the  tubulin

heterodimer without the need for nucleotide binding

The techniques described here would also be suited to check several predictions of recent

theories  regarding  quantum  effects  in  the  cytoskeleton.  The  existence  of  ’flip  waves’  along

24

filaments  of  tubulin  molecules  is  an  important  assumption  of  many  current  theories  of  MT-

network  function  as  a  computational  and  information-processing  system.  To  check  this

hypothesis. The interaction of a longitudinal component of the field of a surface plasmon with a

dipole  moment  may  provide  a  coupling  mechanism  for  the  excitation  and  detection  of  these

waves  in  future  studies.  At  present,  predictions  of  the  phase  velocity  of  flip  waves  differ

drastically. Depending on the model and the parameters assumed, the speed of such  waves  has

been estimated to be between 1  and 800  m/s.  The  external  interaction  with  these  tubulin  states

could  be  performed  by  coupling  laser  light  to  specific  spots  of  the  MT  network.  Signal

propagation  could  be  achieved  by  travelling  electric  dipole  moment  flip  waves  along

protofilaments and MTs while modulation can be achieved by MAP binding that creates (cid:147)nodes(cid:148)

in the MT network.

7. 

Summary

Theoretical efforts by us and others have strongly suggested that tubulin is near the "front

lines"  of  intracellular  information  manipulation  and  storage.  Our  group  has  performed

preliminary  measurements  on  tubulin  in  an  effort  to  supply  experimentally  determined

parameters  (such  as  the  refractive  index,  polarizability  and  dipole  moment)  to  apply  to  the

various  models  of  tubulin.  In  addition,  it  has  become  increasingly  evident  that  fabrication  of

novel  biomaterials  through  molecular  self-assembly  (e.g.  microtubules)  is  going  to  play  a

significant  role  in  material  science  [57]  and  possibly  the  information  technology  of  the  future

[58].  Here  we  have  suggested  that  relatively  straight-forward  spectroscopic  techniques  such  as

refractometry,  surface  plasmon  resonance  sensing  and  dielectric  spectroscopy,  coupled  with

molecular dynamic simulations and (quantum) electrodynamic analytical theory are useful tools

25

in the study of dielectric and quantum properties of proteins and the first steps in those directions

have been illustrated.

We used computer simulation to calculate the electric dipole moments of the two tubulin

monomers  and  dimer  and  found  those  to  be  |pα|=552D,  |pβ|=  1193D  and  |pαβ|=1740D

respectively.  We  used  refractometry  to  corroborate  our  previous  SPR-derived  result  (equation

(1)) for ∆n/∆c ~1.800ml/mg. The refractive index of tubulin was found to be ntub ~2.90 (3) and

that gives the high frequency tubulin dielectric  constant at  κtub ~8.41 (4).  In addition, the high-

frequency  polarizability  was  found  to  be  αtub  ~  2.1x  10-33  C  m2/V  (5).  Several  methods  were

described  to  determine  the  low-frequency  DC-p  as  well  as  to  check  for  both  coherence  and

entanglement among tubulin dimer dipole states. An experiment was suggested whereby using a

perforated metal chip layered with a network of aligned MTs, and employing entangled photons

in the SPR-exciting laser beam, it can be determined whether surface plasmons interacting with

MTs can stay entangled and whether this entanglement can be propagated and conserved by the

biomolecules. Possible applications of tubulin and microtubules to the bioelectronics of the future

were discussed.

8. Conclusion

The electric and energy-transduction properties of tubulin and the polymers it forms are

important  not  only  because  of  the  role  these  play  in  intracellular  protein  interactions  but  also

because it may well be that nature has already provided us with suitable nanowires, switches or

even  logic  gates.  Beyond  the  obvious  benefit  to  the  credibility  or  otherwise  of  the  various

"quantum brain models", determining the dipole moment of tubulin and its dynamics will further

our  understanding  of  tubulin  and  other  similar  proteins  (such  as  actin)  and  will  shed  light  on

26

whether  we  can  use  these  as  the  basis  of  biomolecular  electronic  circuits  of  even  quantum

information processing.

Tubulin, microtubules and the dynamic cytoskeleton are fascinating systems and in their

structure  and  function  contain  the  clues  on  how  to  imitate  nature  in  artificially  fabricated

biomolecular  information  processing  devices  paving  the  way  for  biobits  and  perhaps  even

bioqubits.

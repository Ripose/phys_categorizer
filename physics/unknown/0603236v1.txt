Autoignition  delay  times  have  been  measured  in  a  rapid  compression  machine  at  Lille  at 

temperatures after compression from 630 to 840 K, pressures from 8 to 14 bar, Φ = 1 and for a 

iso-octane/1-hexene mixture containing 82 % iso-octane and 18 % 1-hexene. Results have shown 

that  this  mixture  is  strongly  more  reactive  than  pure  iso-octane,  but  less  reactive  than  pure 

1-hexene.  It  exhibits  a  classical  low  temperature behaviour, with the appearance of cool flame 

and a negative temperature coefficient region. The composition of the reactive mixture obtained 

after the cool flame has also been determined. 

A detailed kinetic model has been obtained by using the system EXGAS, developed in Nancy for 

the  automatic  generation  of  kinetic  mechanisms,  and  an  acceptable  agreement  with  the 

experimental results has been obtained both for autoignition delay times and for the distribution 

of products. 

A  flow  rate  analysis  reveals  that  the  crossed  reactions  between  species  coming  from  both 

reactants (like H-abstractions or combinations) are negligible in the main flow consumption of 

the studied hydrocarbons. The ways of formation of the main primary products observed and the 

most sensitive rate constants have been identified. 

Keywords : mixtures, iso-octane, 1-hexene, rapid compression machine, autoignition, modeling.

INTRODUCTION 

Fuels  usually  contain  six  main  classes  of  organic  compounds  :  paraffins,  isoparaffins,  olefins, 

naphtenes, aromatics (including polyaromatic compounds) and oxygenates. Commercial gasoline 

contains  approximately  150  different  molecules  belonging  to  these  6  classes  of  organic 

compounds.  Since  the  end  of  the  last  decade,  a  great  number  of  experimental  and  theoretical 

studies has made it possible to simulate the combustion of model molecules taken individually 

and  to  predict  the  formation  of  characteristic  pollutants,  as  well  as  autoignition  phenomena. 

Nevertheless, very few studies have been devoted up to now to the case of mixtures containing 

molecules of several classes of organic compounds. The major part of the studies published on 

mixture  oxidation  concerns  mixtures  of  a  paraffin  and  an  isoparaffin,  an  ether  or  an  aromatic 

compound.  The  n-heptane/iso-octane  mixture  is  the  one  which  has  been  the  most  extensively 

investigated.  It  has  been  experimentally  studied  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  [1],  in  a  shock  tube  [2] 

and in a rapid compression machine [3] and several models for its oxidation have been proposed 

[1, 3, 4]. In the case of paraffin/ether mixtures, the autoignition of a propane/MTBE mixture has 

been studied in a shock tube [5], while the oxidation of n-heptane/MTBE and n-heptane/ETBE 

mixtures  has  been  investigated  in  a  jet-stirred  reactor  [6];  in  both  cases,  a  model  has  been 

proposed  [5,  6].  The  effect  of  the  addition  of  toluene  to  the  oxidation  of  alkanes  has  been 

investigated in the case of  n-butane in a plug flow reactor [7] and in the case of n-heptane in a 

jet-stirred  flow  reactor  [8].  The  global  conclusion  of  these  studies  is  that  crossed  reactions  are 

negligible  and  that  the  synergy  effect  occurring  in  a  mixture  is  due  to  reactions  involving  the 

pool  of  small  radicals  and  especially  those  influencing  the  ratio  between  the  concentrations  of 

OH and HO2 radicals [1]. These studies have also demonstrated the inhibiting influence of the 

presence in a mixture of promoters of resonance stabilized radicals such as MTBE or ETBE, the 

oxidation of which leads to important amounts of isobutene and then of isobutenyl radicals [6], 

or toluene [7, 8], which gives benzyl radicals.

Isoparaffins are included up to 30 % and olefins up to 18 % in a commercial gasoline. But apart 

from  a  preliminary  study  of  the  autoignition  of  a  iso-octane/1-hexene  mixture  in  a  shock  tube 

[9], the oxidation of mixtures containing these two types of compounds has not yet been much 

investigated. 

This paper presents an experimental and modeling study of the oxidation and the autoignition of 

a mixture containing iso-octane and 1-hexene, which are model fuels of isoparaffins and olefins 

respectively.  This  study  could  allow  us  to  know  if  the  presence  of  linear  allylic  resonance 

stabilized radicals have a specific effect on the reactivity of a mixture. Iso-octane is a primary 

reference fuel for octane rating in spark-ignited internal combustion engines with by definition a 

Research Octane Number (RON) and a Motor Octane Number (MON) of 100, while 1-hexene is 

more reactive with a RON of 76.4 and a MON of 63.4. The fact that olefins tends to have lower 

MON than RON means that they are relatively more prone to autoignition at higher temperature 

as compared to a primary reference fuel of the same RON.  

 

 

EXPERIMENTAL 

The  rapid  compression  machine  at  Lille  has  been  described  extensively  in  former  publications 

[10,  11]  so  that  only  essential  features  relevant  to  the  present  work  are  presented.  Initial  gas 

mixtures were prepared in glass flasks from pure gas by the method of the partial pressures. The 

combustion  chamber  of  the  rapid  compression  machine  is  a  cylinder  of  40  cm3  fitted  with  a 

pressure  transducer  and  an  optical  access  to  a  photomultiplier.  The  compressed  gas  undergoes 

oxidation  and  autoignition  in  one  or  two  stages  according  to  its  reactivity.  Provision  has  been 

made for preventing any rebound at the end of compression which could inhibit ignition by an 

adiabatic cooling. Pressure and light emission are measured every 40 microseconds during and 

after compression until ignition occurs. The temperature at top dead centre (TTDC) is varied by 

replacing part or whole of nitrogen by argon or carbon dioxide so that the heat capacity of the 

 

4 

 

compressed gas changes. It is calculated using the adiabatic core gas model previously described 

[12] and can be considered as the maximum temperature reached in the combustion chamber at 

top dead center.. Pressure at top dead centre is varied by modifying the initial charge. The delay 

times are taken from top dead centre (TDC). For cool flames, the maximum of the light emission 

profile is taken as the cool flame occurrence time and is confirmed by the inflexion point in the 

pressure profile. For final ignition, the very sharp rise in pressure is taken as the final ignition 

time.  For  final  ignition,  the  very  sharp  rise  in  pressure  is  taken  as  the  total  delay.  A  sampling 

attachment was used to collect and quench the reaction gas mixture in a low-pressure vessel at a 

selected time interval between the cool flame event and final ignition. The collected gas mixture 

was  analysed  by  gas  chromatography.  The  lighter  components  of  the  mixtures  were  separated 

with  a  50  m  porous  polymer  capillary  column  and  the  heavier  ones  with  a  50  m  5  % 

phenylmethylsilicone  capillary  column.  For  the  qualitative  analyses,  a  mass  spectrometer 

detector with ionisation by electron impact was used, for the quantitative determinations a flame 

ionization detector and a thermal conductivity detector. Permanent gases were separated with a 

5A molecular sieve capillary column and determined by the thermal conductivity detector. Each 

species  was  identified  by  a  thorough  study  of  its  spectrum  and  a  comparison  with  published 

spectra and/or analysis of the unimolecular fragmentation paths. For quantitative determinations, 

4 % neon was added to the initial mixture as an internal standard. The detectors were carefully 

calibrated for each species or group of species.  

 

DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL 

The  proposed  model  has  been  generated  using  the  EXGAS  system  and  includes  some  crossed 

reactions,  which  are  detailed  later  in  the  text.  The  mechanisms  generated  by  EXGAS  for  the 

oxidation of 1-hexene [13] and iso-octane [4] taken individually have been previously validated 

in the same  temperature range as the present study.

General features of  the EXGAS system 

As several papers already described the way EXGAS generates detailed kinetic models for the 

oxidation of alkanes [4, 14, 15] and alkenes [13, 16-18], only a summary of its main features is 

given here. The system provides reaction mechanisms made of three parts: 

♦  A C0-C2 reaction base, including all the reactions involving radicals or molecules containing 

less than three carbon atoms [19]. 

♦  A comprehensive primary mechanism including all the reactions of the molecular reactants, 

the initial organic compounds and oxygen, and of the derived free radicals.  

Table 1 summarizes the different types of generic reactions, which are taken into account in the 

primary  mechanism  of  the  oxidation  of  alkanes  and  alkenes  and  shows  which  reactions  are 

considered  for  both  types  of  reactants  and  which  are  only  taken  into  account  in  the  case  of 

alkenes.  Previous  papers  [4,  13-18]  describe  in  details  these  generic  reactions  and  the  related 

kinetic parameters. 

♦  A lumped secondary mechanism, containing reactions consuming the molecular products of 

the primary mechanism which do not react in the reaction base.  

To ensure the primary mechanism to be comprehensive, all the isomers of reactants, primary free 

radicals  and  molecules  are  considered.  Therefore,  during  the  generation  of  the  primary 

mechanism, both EXGAS and the connected softwares use the detailed chemical formulae of all 

these molecules and free radicals, reactants and products. To reduce the number of reactants in 

the secondary reactions, which are the molecular products of the primary mechanism, a lumping 

of these primary molecules is achieved according to the following rules. Molecules, which have 

the same molecular formula, the same functional groups and include rings of the same size, are 

lumped into one unique species, without distinguishing between isomers. This lumping preserves 

the mass balance and the reactivity of the primary species. 

 

 

6 

 

Thermochemical  data  for  molecules  or  radicals  are  automatically  calculated  and  stored  as  14 

polynomial  coefficients,  according  to  the  CHEMKIN II  formalism  [20].  These  data  are 

computed  using  the  THERGAS  software  [21],  based  on  group  or  bond  additivity  and 

thermochemical kinetics methods proposed by Benson [22].  

Kinetic  data  are  either  calculated  using  the  KINGAS  software  [23]  based  on  thermochemical 

kinetics  methods  [22]  or  estimated  through  quantitative  structure-reactivity  relationships [4, 

13-18].  

Crossed reactions 

The software EXGAS is designed to consider systematically the crossed reactions: each time a 

radical  is  created,  it  is  submitted  to  all  possible  generic  propagations  without  considering  its 

reactant of origin. The possible crossed reactions are of two types:  

♦  Metatheses involving the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from iso-octane or 1-hexene by 

a peroxy radical.  

In the mechanisms concerning a single class of hydrocarbon, metatheses are only considered 

for radicals which cannot decompose by beta-scission involving the breaking of a C-C or a 

C-O bond, apart from the peroxy radicals deriving directly from the reactant (i.e. those which 

can be obtained through only 2 elementary steps: an H-abstraction or an addition of OH to 

the double bond followed by an addition to an oxygen molecule). Applying this rule in the 

present case, only peroxy-iso-octyl, peroxy-1-hexenyl or peroxy-hydroxyhexyl radicals can 

react by these reactions : 

1-C6H12  +  C8H17OO → C8H17OOH  +  C6H11

C8H18  +  C6H11OO →  C6H11OOH  +  C8H17

C8H18  +  C6H12OHOO →  C6H12OHOOH  +  C8H17 

The  abstractions  of  vinylic  H-atoms  by  peroxy  radicals  are  neglected.  The  values  of  the 

corresponding rate constants are shown in Table 2.

♦  The  combinations  of  the  allylic  radicals  deriving  from  1-hexene,  1-hexen-3-yl  radicals 

and 3-hexen-2-yl radicals, with tC4H9 and iC3H7 radicals.  

Amongst the radicals obtained from the decomposition by beta-scission of iso-octyl or deriving 

radicals,  only  tC4H9  and  iC3H7  radicals  are  taken  into  account  for  combinations  because  they 

cannot  decompose  by  a  beta-scission  breaking  a  C-C  bond  and  are  consequently  less  reactive 

than other radicals. The rate constants are calculated by KINGAS [23]. 

The full kinetic mechanism, which includes 5435 reactions involving 1231 species, is available 

on request. Simulations have been performed using the SENKIN software of CHEMKIN II [20]. 

 

 

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION  

Figure  1  displays  the  experimental  and  simulated  delay  times  obtained  for  cool  flame  and 

autoignition for three different initial pressures in the rapid compression machine. While several 

experimental  studies  have  demonstrated  that  the  details  of  the  heat  transfer  in  a  rapid 

compression  machine  are  quite  complex,  both  with  respect  to  the  geometry  and  over  the  time 

history  of  the  experiments,  and  that  some  extents  of  reaction  could  occur  during  compression 

stroke, [24, 25], satisfactory modeling of ignition delay times measured using the apparatus used 

in this study has been obtained for a wide range of alkanes from C4 to C10 assuming adiabaticity 

and  with  conditions  after  compression  calculated  based  on  a  core  gas  model  [4,  26].  Figure  1 

shows that the autoignition and cool flame delay times are globally well reproduced, apart from 

the autoignition delay times for the lowest pressure range which are underestimated by a factor 

about 2 in a wide part of the temperatures range. 

Figure 2 presents a comparison between the experimental ignition delay times measured for the 

iso-octane/1-hexene  mixture  studied  here  and  those  obtained  for  pure  iso-octane  and  pure 

1-hexene, respectively, in the same range of pressure (11.6-14 bar) in the same apparatus. The 

results  concerning  iso-octane  are  those  previously  measured  [27],  the  values  concerning 

 

8 

 

1-hexene have been extrapolated from previous measurements at lower pressure (7-11 bar) [28] 

by  correlating  the  logarithm  of  the  ignition  delay  time  with  the  logarithm  of  the  pressure.  The 

experimental reactivity of the mixture lies globally between that of the two pure compounds, but, 

at low temperature, it is closer to that of 1-hexene, while it is a little more intermediate to both 

fuels  above  700  K.  Considering  the  differences  in  MON  and  RON,  it  is  not  surprising  that 

1-hexene become still more reactive compared to iso-octane at higher temperature. Simulations 

reproduce well this behaviour, even if the reactivity of iso-octane is slightly overpredicted in the 

beginning of the negative temperature coefficient area. This figure also shows that simulations 

with a mixture containing 18 % iso-octane and 82 % 1-hexene lead to the same ignition delay 

times than with pure 1-hexene in all the temperatures ranges. 

Figure 3 displays the experimental and simulated conversions of the reactants vs. residence time 

for an initial temperature of 707 K in the conditions of figure 1b. This figure also presents the 

simulated  temporal  profile  of  OH  radicals  mole  fraction.  In  agreement  with  figure  1b, 

experiments and simulations lead to close times for the first rise of the conversion of iso-octane 

and 1-hexene and of the OH radicals mole fraction, showing a good prediction of the cool flame 

delay time. After the cool flame, while the relative consumption of the two reactants is correctly 

modelled, the simulated overall reactivity is strongly overestimated inducing to a much shorter 

ignition delay time than what is experimentally measured.    

Despite this disagreement in the global reactivity, it is interesting to compared the experimental 

and  simulated  products  distributions:  Table  3  presents  the  experimental  and  simulated 

selectivities  of  the  different  products  which  have  been  analysed.  These  analyses  have  been 

performed for a residence time of 19 ms corresponding to the period just after the cool flame in 

the conditions of Figure 3, for which the experimental conversions of iso-octane and 1-hexene 

are equal to 24 % and 33 %, while the simulated values are 53 % and 72 %, respectively. The 

simulated  temperature  reaches  857  K,  but,  because  of  the  lower  reactivity,  the  experimental 

 

 

9 

 

 

 

 

 

 

temperature  is  probably  much  lower.  The  selectivity,  Si(t),  in  %  molar  of  a  species  i,  at  a 

residence time t, is given by the following equation : 

Si(t)  =  100 x γitx ni(t)/(γr0xnr(t0) – γrtx nr(t)) 

with :    

 ni(t): Number of mole of the species i at the residence time t, 

 nr(t0): Sum of the numbers of mole of the two reactants at the initial time t0, 

 nr(t): Sum of the numbers of mole of the two reactants at the residence time t, 

 γit: Number of atoms of carbon in the species i at the residence time t, 

 

 γr0:  Average  number  of  carbon  atoms  in  the  two  reactants  at  the  initial  time  t0, 

here 7.64, 

 

 γrt: Average number of carbon atoms in the two reactants at the residence time t. 

Hexadiene and one isomer of dimethyl pentenes are not separated in our analysis. The sum of the 

selectivities of the analysed products is around 50 %, which correspond to a material balance in 

global  carbon  around  87  %.  That  is  due  to  the  presence  of  formaldehyde  (the  simulated 

selectivity  is  equal  to  5.3  %)  and  carbon  dioxide  (the  simulated  selectivity  is  equal  to  1.7  %), 

which have not been quantified, and to the formation of unknown products. No product which 

can be attributed to a crossed reaction between both reactant has been detected. 

Table 3 shows also that the model reproduces the major trends of the distribution of products.  

Nevertheless,  important  discrepancies  are  obtained  for  the  formations  of  iso-octenes,  oxirans, 

ethylene, carbon monoxide and some oxygenated products obtained in the secondary mechanism 

(propenol, methylpropenol, butenals…). Quantitative discrepancies may be due to the gradients 

of  temperature  which  are  observed  inside  the  combustion  chamber  of  a  rapid  compression 

machine  [29]  and  from  the  ill-defined  temperature  history  arising  from  this  spatial 

inhomogeneity.  The  low  formation  of  C4  ethers  is  probably  due  to  a  too  low  rate  constant  of 

formation,  but  the  value  that  we  use  (k  =  9.1.1010  exp(-8380/T)  s-1)  has  been  shown  to  be  a 

sensitive parameter for the modeling of ignition delay times for alkanes [4] and is close to the 

 

10 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

value  (k  =  7.5x1010exp(-7675/T) s-1)  proposed  by  Curran  et  al.  [30]  for  the  same  type  of 

reactions. Ethylene and carbon dioxide are usually overestimated by the models obtained from 

EXGAS, due to the structure of the lumped secondary mechanism. In this part of the model, the 

molecular products obtained in the primary mechanism are lumped according to their molecular 

formulae and functional groups and the reactions of these lumped molecules are not elementary 

steps, but global reactions which result in the formation of molecules or radicals whose reactions 

are  included  in  the  C0-C2  reaction  base  in  the  smaller  number  of  elementary  steps  [19].  This 

greatly favors the formation of ethylene compared to that of heavier alkenes and that of carbon 

dioxide compared to heavier oxygenated products. This is an important weakness of the system 

EXGAS  which  needs  to  be  improved  in  the  future,  but  it  is  difficult  to  find  a  better  way  to 

accurately reproduce the reactions of the numerous molecular products obtained in the primary 

mechanism  without  an  exponential  increase  of  the  size  of  the  mechanism.  However,  this 

approximation does not affect too much the calculations of autoignition delay times. 

Figure 4 displays a sensitivity analysis performed by dividing by a factor 10 the rate constant of 

each  generic  reaction.  This  figure  shows  that  all  the  influential  reactions  are  included  in  the 

primary mechanism, except for the decomposition of hydroperoxide species, which has a strong 

promoting  effect  at  650  K.  Compared  to  a  similar analysis performed in the case of n-heptane 

[4], this figure shows the influence of initiations which are easier with alkenes, OH additions and 

combinations. Figure 5 and 6 present flow rate analyses at 857 K in the conditions of Table 3 for 

the  consumption  of  iso-octane  and  1-hexene,  respectively.  Sensitivity  and  flow  analyses  show 

that the influence of the considered crossed reactions are negligible. 

 Figure  5  shows  that  iso-octane  reacts  by  H-abstractions  to  give  the  four  possible  iso-octyl 

radical isomers. These radicals react with oxygen molecules to give peroxy radicals or to form 

HO2 radicals and the two isomers of iso-octene shown in Table 3. Iso-octyl radical isomers also 

decompose to give dimethyl-pentene and methyl radicals, isobutene and iso-butyl radicals, and 

 

 

11 

 

propene  and  neo-pentyl  radicals.  Methyl  radicals  react  with  oxygen  to  form  formaldehyde, 

iso-butyl  radicals  react  with  oxygen  to  give  iso-butene  and  neo-pentyl  radicals  decompose  to 

give  isobutene  and  methyl  radicals.  Dimethyl-pentene,  propene  and  isobutene  are  important 

primary products as pointed out in Table 3. Iso-octyl peroxy radicals react by isomerization and 

lead  to  the  formation  of  ketohydroperoxides  or  of  all  the  cyclic  ethers  (from  three  to  six 

membered cycles) listed as primary products in Table 3. 

While bimolecular initiations involving 1-hexene have a slight promoting effect as pointed out in 

Figure 4, Figure 6 shows that this alkene mainly reacts by addition of OH radical, abstraction of 

an allylic hydrogen atom and abstraction of a secondary alkylic hydrogen atom. A more detailed 

flow analysis points out that 4 % of 1-hexene reacts with HO2 to give 2-butyloxirane, 7% reacts 

by addition of hydrogen atoms to the double bond to give hexyl radicals, 6 % by abstraction of a 

primary  alkylic  hydrogen  atom  and  3  %  by  abstraction  of  a  vinylic  hydrogen  atom.  The 

hydroxyhexyl  radicals  obtained  by  addition  of  OH  radicals  to  the  double  bond  and  their 

subsequent  isomerizations  react  mainly  by  oxidation  to  produce  hexanal  and  by  addition  to 

oxygen  to  produce  C6H12OHOO.  These  peroxy  radicals  mainly  lead  to  the  formation  of 

formaldehyde,  pentanal,  and  •OH,  due 

to 

isomerizations/decompositions  [31],  or 

to 

hydroxyhydroperoxyalkyl 

radicals,  which 

lead  ultimately 

to 

the  production  of 

hydroxyketohydroperoxides or cyclic ethers bearing an alcohol function. The radicals obtained 

from the abstraction of an allylic hydrogen atom and the following isomerization react mainly by 

addition  to  oxygen  and  lead  ultimately  to  the  formation  of  ketohydroperoxides  or  unsaturated 

cyclic ethers, amongst which 2-ethyl-2,5-dihydrofuran, which was analysed during the oxidation 

of pure 1-hexene in similar conditions [28]. These resonance stabilised radicals can also react by 

combination with HO2 radicals and form a hydroperoxide, the decomposition of which leads to 

acroleine. That explains the a priori surprising promoting effect of combinations shown in Figure 

4  and  the  increase  of  the  reactivity of 1-hexene when temperature increases shown in figure 2 

 

 

12 

 

and  in  the  differences  between  its  MON  and  RON.  The  radicals  obtained  by  abstraction  of  a 

secondary  alkylic  hydrogen  atom  react  by  addition  to  oxygen  and  lead  to  unsaturated  cyclic 

ethers, but a fraction of them also reacts with oxygen molecules to give HO2 radicals and several 

isomers of hexadienes (mainly 1,3-hexadiene) which are listed in Table 3. 

Amongst the main products shown by the flow analysis of Figures 5 and 6, all the compounds 

directly deriving from iso-octane have been found in the analysis shown in Table 3, while only 

acroleine, pentanal and hexadiene have been detected in the case of 1-hexene. That can be due to 

the  fact  that  the  mixture  contains  only  18  %  of  1-hexene,  making  the  products  analysis  more 

difficult than when it is the only reactant. Another reason could be that 1-hexene leads to primary 

products (e.g. unsaturated cyclic ethers, aldehydes) which are less stable than those of iso-octane 

(e.g. saturated cyclic ethers, alkenes) and which are then more rapidly consumed by secondary 

reactions. 

The difference of reactivity between 1-hexene and iso-octane is due to two main reasons. First, 

as  it  is  shown  by  experiments  and  simulations,  1-hexene  is  more  rapidly  consumed  than 

iso-octane. The additions of OH radicals to the double bond and the possible abstractions of 2 

secondary  allylic  hydrogen  atoms,  4  secondary  alkylic  hydrogen  atoms  and  3  primary  alkylic 

hydrogen atoms in the alkene lead to a higher global rate constant (k = 1.6x1013 cm3.mol-1.s-1 at 

700  K,  for  the  global  reaction  with  OH  radicals)  than  the  possible  abstractions  of  1  tertiary 

alkylic  hydrogen  atom,  2  secondary  alkylic  hydrogen  atoms  and  12  primary  alkylic  hydrogen 

atoms in the branched alkane (k = 1.0x1013 cm3.mol-1.s-1 at 700 K, for the H-abstractions by OH 

radicals).  In  addition,  Figure  4  shows  that  OH  additions  and  H-abstraction  have  an  important 

promoting  effect.  Second,  as  shown  in  the  case  of  n-heptane/iso-octane  mixtures  [1],  the 

isomerizations  of  peroxyradicals  and  peroxyhydroperoxide  radicals  are  easier  in  a  linear 

compound than in a branched compound. In addition in the case of alkenes, the isomerizations 

leading to resonance stabilized radicals are favoured. The fact that isomerizations are slower in 

 

 

13 

 

the  case  of  iso-octane  favors  reactions,  which  compete  with  the  additions  of  oxygen.  These 

reactions are oxidations (i.e. the reaction between alkyl radicals and oxygen to give conjugated 

alkenes and HO2• radicals) and formations of cyclic ethers (competing with the second addition 

to oxygen). This is in agreement with the analysis of products displayed in Table 3 and showing 

an  important  formation  of  conjugated  alkenes  and  cyclic  ethers  deriving  from  iso-octane  and 

only a small amount of acroleine, pentanal and hexadienes deriving from 1-hexene.  

It is interesting to note that in Figure 4, the generic primary reactions with the highest inhibiting 

effect are oxidations (the reactions with oxygen molecules to give alkenes, dienes, aldehydes or 

ketones  and  HO2  radicals)  and  the  formations  of  cyclic  ethers  and  that  those  with  the  highest 

promoting  effect  are  the  additions  of  oxygen  molecules  and  isomerizations.  Oxidations  have  a 

strong inhibiting effect at 650 K because of the production of the very stable HO2 radicals. These 

most  abundant  HO2  radicals  can  almost  only  react  by  termination,  mainly  to  give  H2O2 

molecules, which decompose slowly below 800 K. Consequently, the structure of the molecule 

of  iso-octane,  which  promotes  the  formation  of  alkenes  and  cyclic  ethers  instead  of  that  of 

degenerate  branching  agents,  leads  to  a  much  lower  reactivity  of  this  compound  with  oxygen 

than  in  the  case  of  1-hexene,  even  if  this  alkene  leads  to  some  formations  of  stabilized  allylic 

radicals.  During  the  reaction  of  a  mixture,  there  is  a  common  pool  of  free  radicals  and  the 

oxidations, formations of cyclic ethers and, to a less extend, some other propagation reactions of 

the hydroperoxyl radicals (QOOH), e.g. beta-scissions of QOOH producing aldehyde or ketones 

and OH radicals or alkenes and HO2 radicals, and have an effect on the global reactivity, since 

they  prevent  an  increase  of  the  global  concentration  of  active  radicals.  Consequently,  when 

temperature increases, the inhibiting influence of the oxidation (competing with the first addition 

to  oxygen)  and  formation  of  cyclic  ethers  (competing  with  the  second  addition  to  oxygen) 

deriving from iso-octane increases as the reversibility of the additions to oxygen increases and 

that  makes  the  mixture  less  reactive  as  it  is  shown  in  Figure  2.  For  too  low  concentrations  of 

 

 

14 

 

iso-octane, the inhibiting influence of these reactions is not strong enough to lower the reactivity 

induced by the presence of 1-hexene.  

In summary, the behaviour of the 1-hexene/iso-octane mixture is not much different from that of 

n-heptane/iso-octane mixture. The presence of the linear C6 allylic resonance stabilized radicals 

has  no  specific  effect  on  the  reactivity  of  the  mixture.  This behaviour is  different  from that of 

mixtures  with  ethers  such  as  MTBE  or  ETBE  [6]  or  with  toluene  [7,  8],  for  which  very 

unreactive resonance stabilized isobutenyl or benzyl radicals are formed and have a more marked 

retarding effect.  

CONCLUSION  

 

 

This paper presents experimental and modeling results concerning the autoignition of a mixture 

containing 1-hexene and iso-octane, which appears to have a reactivity close to 1-hexene below 

700  K  and  to  be  less  reactive  when  temperature  increases.  The  analysis  of  both  experimental 

products and simulated flow reaction rates shows that crossed reactions are negligible and that 

1-hexene is more rapidly consumed and gives less stable products than iso-octane. The decrease 

of the reactivity of the mixture with temperature seems to be due to the increasing importance of 

the  formation  of  saturated  cyclic  ethers  and  of  the  oxidations  giving  iso-octene  and  the  very 

unreactive  HO2  radicals,  compared  to  other  propagating  reactions  leading  to  branching  agents. 

The presence of the linear allylic resonance stabilized radicals seems to have no specific effect 

on the reactivity of this mixture with a branched alkanes. This conclusion could be different in 

the case of linear alkanes, such as n-heptane, which are more reactive or in presence of branched 

allylic  resonance  stabilized  radicals,  such  as  isobutenyl  radicals,  which  could  have  a  more 

pronounced inhibiting effect. 

While the detailed kinetic model proposed here leads to a globally acceptable agreement with the 

experimental results, discrepancies for the formation for some important primary products such 

 

15 

as  iso-octenes  and  oxirans  show  that  some  work  is  still  needed  to  completely  understand  the 

oxidation  of  alkanes  and  alkenes.  In  additions,  the  secondary  mechanism  would  need  to  be 

improved in the future in order to predict the range of products formed more accurately.

Abstract  The comment of Guseinov is irrelevant and also unjust. In contrast to his comment, we show that the 
obtained electric multipole moment values for some first-row diatomic molecules are original and better than his values 
(I.I. Guseinov, E. Akin, and A.M. Rzaeva, J. Mol. Struct. (Theochem)  453 (1998) 163) with respect to Hartree-Fock 
values. Moreover, it must be noted that all the formulas are cited in our paper (M. Orbay and T. Ozdogan, Commun. 
Theor. Phys. (Beijing, China)  35  (2001) 585) and corrigendum (M. Orbay and T. Ozdogan, Commun. Theor. Phys. 
(Beijing, China) 37 (2002) 768).

The comment of Guseinov[1] includes some claims that 
we consider as irrelevant and also unjust. With respect to 
his comments, his claims will be replied in the following: 
Comment 1  He claims that the formulas given by 
[2] are copied directly 

[3] 

Eqs. (1)-(6) in our paper
from his paper. 

Response to comment  1 
•  As stated in our paper, [2] equations (1) and (2) are 

originally introduced in Ref. [4] (cited as Ref. [17] in 
our paper [2]), not in his paper[3].  

•  Equations (3) and (5) are cited in corrigendum [5], 

which can also be found elsewhere (see Refs. [6] and 
[7]). 

•  As is well known in literature, equation (4) is called 
Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO), in 
troduced by Roothaan[8]  (cited as Ref. [19] in our 
paper [2]), not by Guseinov. 

•  From the fundamental postulates of quantum me- 

chanics, expectation values of any physical quantity 
is expressed as in Eq. (6) (see Ref. [9]), not intro- 
duced by Guseinov! 

Comment 2  He claims that the obtained electric 
multipole moment values for some first-row diatomic hy-
dride molecules are not original. 

[2], 
Response to comment 2  As stated in our paper
the expectation values of electric multipole moments are 
expressed through the electric multipole moment integrals 
and linear combination coefficients. That is, the efficiency 
of electric multipole moments strongly depends on accu-
rate and speed calculation of electric multipole  moment

integrals and linear combination coefficients. In this re-
spect, our study[2] has the following advantages over his 
study[3]: 

•  The efficiency of electric multipole moment integrals 
depends on accurate and speed calculation of overlap 
integrals (see Eq. (7) of Ref. [10]). In the calculation 
of electric multipole moment integrals, Guseinov[3] 
used the formula for overlap integrals presented in 
Ref. [11], which we think the efficiency may decrease 
especially in higher values of quantum numbers and 
internuclear distances due to the mathematical aux- 
iliary functions appearing in structure of overlap in- 
tegrals. But in our study, we  used  the recurrence 
relation for overlap integrals presented in Ref. [12], 
which do not injure from possible instability prob- 
lems.   Also, it can be seen easily from the Tables 
of Refs.   [11]  and  [12]  that the algorithm[12]  used 
in our study[2]  is more  speed than  the algorithm[11] 
used in Ref. [3]. It should be stressed that the used 
algorithm for the evaluation of multicenter electric 
multipole moment integrals are analyzed for wide 
changes of molecular parameters, and more advan- 
tages are obtained[13,14].  

•  In our study[2], the linear combination coefficients 
appearing in the  evaluation  of electric  multipole 
moments of molecules LiH, BH and FH are calcu- 
lated by constructing computer programs via the 
recent developments in the calculation of multicen- 
ter molecular integrals over Slater-type orbitals, un- 
der  research  fund with our  group[15,16]. On the other 
hand, in his study[3] he used very  old linear combi- 
nation coefficients in Ref. [17], which may strongly 
effect the efficiency of electric multipole moment val- 
ues. 

 

•  As  is  known  it  is  not  possible  to  have  empiri- 
cal values of higher electric multipole moments for 
molecules, such as octupole and hexadecapole mo- 
ments.   Therefore, the theoretical determination of 
higher electric multipole moments attracts consid- 
erable attention[18]. While  his  study is  limited to 
the calculation of octupole moments, our study[2] 
contains also hexadecapole moments. 

•  As is well known, owing to its modest size, Hydrogen 
Floride (HF) has served as a benchmark molecule 
for ab initio quantum chemical methods for over 40 
years (see Ref. [19] and references quoted therein). 
In our study [2], the electric multipole moments, total 
energies, orbital energies and linear combination co- 
efficients of molecular orbitals for molecule HF are 

presented.  But  his study  [3]  does  not contain any 
calculations on this molecule. 

Comment 3  In his note, he claims that the authors 
made an article [20] by changing the summation indices of 
his formula. 

Response to comment 3  As can be easily seen from 
the title of our paper in Ref. [20] that our work includes 
the beginning step for the calculation of multicenter 
integrals over STOs with noninteger principal quantum 
numbers. And also, it is known that there was no study of 
Guseinov on the calculation of multicenter integrals over 
STOs with noninteger principal quantum numbers, up to 
the publication date of our work [20]. Moreover, the com-
ment made by Guseinov[21] is replied and the advantages 
over his algorithm are critically analyzed in Ref. [22]*

Abstract 

The fixed-nuclei full dimensional time-dependent Schrödinger equation is directly solved for H2

+ in the 

linearly polarized laser field of I=1.0×1014 W/cm2 and λ = 1064 nm. Instantaneous ionization rate has 

been introduced and calculated by evaluating the instantaneous imaginary energy of the system. It is 

shown  that  positive  (negative)  values  of  instantaneous  imaginary  energy  of  the  system  represent  the 

incoming (outgoing) instantaneous current of electron. This approach allows us to determine not only 

the  instantaneous  intensity  but  also  the  instantaneous  direction  of  the  electronic  current.  The 

instantaneous behavior of the electron wavepacket in intense laser field can thus be probed precisely. 

Details of the enhanced ionization rates are studied based on the instantaneous ionization rates. This 

approach gives direct evidence for existence of the effect of charge-resonance-enhanced multiphoton 

resonances  of  the  quasienergy  states  (QES)  with  excited  electronic  states  at  some  particular 

internuclear  distances.  Finally,  Contributions  of  the  individual  time  dependent  Floquet  QES  to  the 

overall ionization rates are evaluated.

Introduction 

Hydrogen  atom  and  hydrogen  molecular  ion  are  two  fundamental  and  prototypical  systems 

which can be used to understand and extend the science of atomic and molecular physics. In intense 

laser  field,  these  two  apparently  simple  systems  exhibit  various  complex  phenomena  [1-3].  An 

interesting  and  complicated  effect  is  the  enhancement  of  the  ionization  rate  of  H2

+  as  a  function  of 

inter-nuclear  separation  which  results  in  maxima  at  some  critical  inter-nuclear  H-H  separations. 

Indirect  [4,5]  and  direct  [6]  evidences  has  been  reported  for  a  similar  behavior  in  more  complex 

molecules.  In  order  to  characterize  and  interpret  this  enhanced  ionization  rates,  which  was  observed 

previously  at  some  critical  inter-nuclear  distances  [7-12],  recent  theoretical  studies  on  the  H2

+–laser 

interaction  have  been  concentrated  on  the  calculation  of  the  ionization  rate  as  a  function  of  inter-

nuclear distance R [13-21].  

For the molecules subjected to short intense laser pulses, molecular dissociation is accompanied 

by ionization. At high  intensities  (I>1014  W/cm2)  for  which  the  ionization process  is  generally faster 

than  the  dissociation  process,  it  is  possible  to  study  molecular  ionization  processes  independently  at 

fixed inter-nuclear separations. The ionization rate of H2

+ near the equilibrium inter-nuclear separation 

of  2  au  is  relatively  small  and  thus  dissociation  proceeds  more  easily  than  ionization  does.  The 

molecules in intense laser fields are strongly aligned due to the acquired torque from the laser field. 

Moreover,  the  ionization  process  is  relatively  fast  compared  to  the  vibrational  motion  of  the  nuclei. 

Therefore,  the  numerical  solution  of  the  full  dimensional  time-dependent  Schrödinger  equation 

(TDSE) of H2

+ system in intense laser field is reduced to the numerical solution of the electronic TDSE 

as the fixed nuclei approximation, which is also experimentally well acceptable, can well be employed.

has so far been used to calculate ionization rate in the Floquet method, both in the time-independent

Instantaneous  imaginary  energies  of  H2

+  at  some  fixed  inter-nuclear  separations  have  been 

calculated by direct solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in the presence of the linearly 

polarized  laser  field  with  I=1.0×1014 W/cm2  and  λ = 1064 nm.  The  overall  ionization  rate  of  H2

+  at 

each inter-nuclear distance is calculated by averaging the calculated instantaneous ionization rates. The 

ionization  rates  are  averaged  from 

10=τ

  to 

20=τ

  cycles  of  the  laser  field.  Figure  1  shows  the  R-

dependent ionization rates calculated in the present study (●) for the H2

+ system. In the same Figure, 

ionization rates calculated by Lu and Bandrauk (∆) [15], Peng et al. (□) [16] and Chu and Chu (×) [18] 

are also given for comparison. The isolated single point on the vertical coordinate at R=14 corresponds 

to the ionization rate of an isolated H atom in the same laser field and is given for comparison. Our 

simulations were performed in a box with (640,170) size for the (z, ρ) directions. As can be seen from 

Figure 1, the four sets of calculated ionization rates are in good validating agreement, especially in the 

range of R>9.6. It can be seen also that the first baseline peak (spanning over inter-nuclear distances 

between R=4 and R=7.5) is structured. Our results show furthermore a weak peak at R=4.8 which is 

 

4

not  predicted  by  previous  works,  and  another  stronger  peak  at  R=6  which  is  consistent  with  Lu  and 

Bandrauk[15] and Chu and Chu[18]. The strongest peak is located at about R=9.4. 

It is obvious that the instantaneous ionization rate, 

)(tΓ , can be obtained by calculating the time-

dependent norm of the wavefunction (

where

is the norm of the system at t=0. Both equations, Eq. (5) and Eq. (6), give the

same results.  

Evaluation of the instantaneous ionization rate (via either equations) has a distinct advantage; 

allowing us to follow the time-dependent ionization processes of a system and to study details of the 

ionization  mechanism.  For  this  purpose,  the  time-dependent  ionization  rates  of  H2

+  in  the  linearly 

polarized field of I= 1.0×1014 W/cm2 intensity and  λ = 1064 nm wavelength for a number of selected 

inter-nuclear  separations  have  been  calculated  and  presented  in  Figure  2.  The  R  values  in  Figure  2 

(except for R=3.6) correspond to the peaks of the ionization rates presented in Figure 1. 

On the basis of Eq. (5), positive (negative) value of instantaneous imaginary energy results in 

negative (positive) value for instantaneous ionization rate, and therefore, the positive (negative) value 

of the instantaneous imaginary energy corresponds to the incoming (outgoing) of the electron to (from) 

the system. For example, as can be seen from Figure 2(a), the instantaneous ionization rate at R=3.6, 

which are calculated via Eq. (5), has both positive and negative values The ionization rate at R=3.6 , 

~3.2×10-5 fs-1, is negligible because the amplitudes of the variation of the instantaneous ionization rate 

over  time  are  very  small  as  compared  with  those  at  other  inter-nuclear  separation  points  (see  other 

parts  of  Figure  2).  Furthermore,  the  relative  outgoing  and  incoming  (returning)  electron  are  nearly 

equal  and  thus  the  cancellation  of  the  two  electron  currents  results  in  a  negligibly  small  overall 

5

 

 

 

ionization rate. The instantaneous ionization rates at inter-nuclear separations other than R=3.6 shows 

that  probability  of  the  return  current  vanishes  because  the  instantaneous  ionization  rates  are  always 

positive (Figure 2). 

All  of  the  calculated  time-dependent  ionization  rate  curves  shown  in  Figure  2  consist  of 

repeating non-symmetric baseline peaks corresponding to one half cycle of the laser field. Each one of 

these  baseline  peaks  has  several  sharp  peaks  in  its  structure.  The  relative  amplitudes  of  these  sharp 

peaks may change, but their relative  positions remain  almost constant from one baseline peak to the 

other. The baseline peaks, which are related to the outgoing electron current from the boundary of the 

system,  have  a  delay  time  with  respect  to  the  peaks  of  the  laser  field.  For  example,  our  calculation 

shows that the delay time for R = 9.6 is about 0.85 cycle. The delay time depends on the size of the 

system; the larger the grid size of the system, the longer the delay time.  

The  mechanism  giving  rise to the  critical distances in which ionization  rates are  enhanced  and 

details  of  the  R-dependent  ionization  rates  have  received  considerable  attentions  from  the  earliest 

studies [4-23]. Zuo and Bandrauk [8] suggested that charge-resonance and positions of the two lowest 

levels  of  the  H2

+  system  in  the  laser  field  (at  its  maximum  amplitude)  can  explain  the  enhanced 

ionization peaks. Mulyukov et al. [14] believe that over barrier ionization out of the higher well for the 

most prominent peak in the ionization rate is impeded by backscattering of the electron from the hump 

between  the  wells.  They  argued  that  at  certain  values  of  R,  the  electron  can  escape  more  easily  by 

undergoing a resonant transition to an energetically nearby highly excited state localized in the lower 

well so that the hump between the wells does not impede over barrier ionization. 

Chu and Chu tried to resolve detailed mechanism of the ionization enhancement phenomenon by 

calculating  ionization  rates  of  the  QESs  [18].  They  applied  an  ac  Floquet  calculation  to  study 

characteristics and dynamical behavior of complex QESs at different R. They introduced a complex-

 

6

scaling generalized pseudospectral (CSGPS) technique for the determination of the complex QESs for 

two-center diatomic molecular systems. Chu and Chu’s calculations showed that the dominant electron 

population  remains  in  the 

gσ1

  and 

uσ1

  states  in  the  laser  of  1×1014W/cm2  intensity.  Thus,  the  two 

distinctly different groups of QESs, i.e. the lower and upper groups, whose major components are the 

field-free 

gσ1

 and 

uσ1

, can be derived. 

Because of the Floquet symmetry, all of the QESs in the lower (or in the upper) group separated 

by  ωm2

  (m  is  integer)  in  energy,  are  in  fact  physically  indistinguishable  and  contain  the  same 

information regarding multiphoton dynamics. Thus, all QESs in the lower (or in the upper) group have 

identical imaginary energies. They used the dynamical properties of these two sets of QESs to explore 

the mechanism(s) responsible for the enhanced ionization phenomenon. Their results reported also in 

Figure 3 indicate that the QESs in the lower and upper groups both show a double-peak enhancement 

feature. A detailed analysis of the nature and dynamical behavior of these QESs by Chu and Chu [18] 

reveals that the ionization enhancement is mainly due to the effect of the charge-resonance-enhanced 

multiphoton resonances of the 

gσ1

 and 

uσ1

 states with the excited electronic states at some particular 

inter-nuclear distances. 

To  evaluate  individual  contribution  from  the  lower  and  upper  sets  of  QESs  to  the  overall 

ionization  rates,  in  Figure  3,  we  have  compared  the  overall  ionization  rates  obtained  in  the  present 

work (Figure 1) with the  isolated  ionization rates of these two  QESs reported by Chu and Chu  [18]. 

This comparison show that the lower QES dominantly determines the overall ionization rates for all of 

the 

R <

3.6

  and 

R >

5.2

  ranges.  While,  for  the  region  in  between  these  ranges,  i.e. 

3.6

<

2.5R
<

, 

both lower and upper QESs contribute competitively to the overll ionization rates. Therefore, the first 

peak of the R-dependent overall ionization rate curve observed in our calculations can be assigned to 

 

7

the  upper  QES,  and  the  second  and  third  peaks  of  the  R-dependent  overall  ionization  rate  can  be 

attributed to the lower QES. 

Based on the instantaneous ionization rate calculated in this work, details of the time-dependent 

behavior  of  the  system  following  the  variations  of  the  laser  field  can  be  extracted  and  used  in  the 

interpretation of the enhanced ionization rates. As can be seen from Figure 2, the enhanced ionization 

rate at about R=9.6 in Figure 1 can be attributed mainly to the several strong and sharp time-dependent 

ionization  peaks.  Existence  of  these  strong  sharp  peaks  is  a  direct  evidence  for  the  effect  of  charge-

resonance-enhanced  multiphoton  resonances  of  the 

gσ1

  and 

uσ1

  states  with  the  excited  electronic 

states at some particular inter-nuclear distances [14,18]. These sharp peaks are not necessarily located 

at  the  maxima  of  the  laser  field  oscillations.  The  baseline  peaks  at  R=9.6,  Figure  2(d),  have  large 

amplitudes without effective falling to near zero. While at other inter-nuclear distances, baseline peaks 

of the time-dependent ionization rates fall off effectively to very small values after each rising period 

(see  Figure  2).  As  compared  to  R=9.6,  amplitudes  of  the  baseline  peaks  at  other  inter-nuclear 

separations, for example at R=6.0, are relatively small in spite of having some sharp peaks. Therefore, 

it can be concluded that the overall ionization rate increases as the number of strong sharp peaks and 

the level of the baseline of the time-dependent ionization rates increase. 

Conclusion 

In  conclusion,  we  introduced  and  calculated  instantaneous  ionization  rate  based  on  the 

instantaneous  values  of  imaginary  energy.  It  is  shown  that  positive  and  negative  instantaneous 

imaginary  energies  of  the  system  represent  respectively  the  incoming  (returning)  and  the  outgoing 

instantaneous  current  of  electron.  Thus,  the  instantaneous  behavior  of  the  electron  wavepacket  in 

intense  laser  field  can  be  probed  closely  using  the  instantaneous  imaginary  energy  of  the  system.  In 

this approach, one can determine the instantaneous intensity and direction of the electronic current. We 

 

8

can  also  determine  the  delay  time  of  the  outgoing  electron  wavepackets  with  respect  to  the 

corresponding peaks of the laser field. The instantaneous ionization rate is used to study details of the 

enhanced  ionization  rates  observed  at  specific  inter-nuclear  distances.  This  approach  gives  direct 

evidence for the existence of the effect of charge-resonance-enhanced multiphoton resonances of the 

QESs  with  excited  electronic  states  at  some  particular  inter-nuclear  distances.  TDSE  and  ac  Floquet 

calculations together form a powerful tool to derive detailed mechanism of the ionization enhancement 

phenomenon. The comparison between the results obtained by these two methods lead us to determine 

the individual contribution of the QESs to the overall ionization rates.

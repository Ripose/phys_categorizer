Modification of special relativity and the divergence
problem in quantum field theory

The root of the divergence problem in the current quantum field theory seems to be in the special
theory of relativity. Here we propose a modified special relativity theory by introducing the primed inertial
coordinate system, in addition to the usual inertial coordinate system, for each inertial frame of reference,
assuming  the  flat  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  and
their  generalized  Finslerian  structures  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  and  combining  this
assumption with the two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the
one-way speed of light in all inertial frames of reference. The modified special relativity  theory  involves
two versions of the light speed, infinite speed c’ in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c
in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  The  physical  principle  is:  the  c’-type  Galilean  invariance  in  the
primed inertial coordinate system plus the transformation from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate
systems.  The  modified  special  relativity  theory  and  the  quantum  mechanics  theory  together  found  a
convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

The current Lorentz-invariant field theory, whether classical or quantum, has been suffering from
the  divergence  difficulties  for  a  long  time.  Indeed,  the  infinite  self-energy  of  an  electron  in  quantum
electrodynamics  was  known  as  early  as  1929  [1].  The  origins  of  these  difficulties  lay  deep  within  the
conceptual foundations of the theory. Two foundation stones of  the  current  quantum  field  theory  are  the
special  relativity  theory  and  the  quantum  mechanics  theory.  Since  it  is  the  case  that  both  classical  field
theory and quantum field theory are plagued by the divergence difficulties, the direction to get to the root
of  these  difficulties  seems  to  be  in  the  special  relativity  theory.    In  this  letter,  we  propose  a  modified
special  relativity  theory  and  show  how  it,  combined  with  the  quantum  mechanics  theory,  founds  a
convergent and invariant quantum field theory. The  establishment  of  this  quantum  field  theory  does  not
demand departures from the concepts in the current quantum field theory such as local gauge symmetries,
locality and local Lorentz invariance in the usual inertial coordinate systems, except for the radical change
in our notion about local structures of gravity-free space and time.

Einstein  published  his  special  theory  of  relativity  in  1905  [2].  He  derived  the  Lorentz
transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate systems, which is a kinematical background for
the physical principle of the Lorentz invariance. The two fundamental postulates stated by Einstein as the
basis for his theory are (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the one-way speed of light in
all inertial frames of reference. Besides these two fundamental postulates, the special  theory  of  relativity
also  uses  another  assumption.  This  other  assumption  concerns  the  Euclidean  structure  of  gravity-free
space  and  the  homogeneity  of  gravity-free  time  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3,
x1=x, x2=y, x3=z:

rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,
everywhere and every time.
Postulates  (i)  and  (ii)  together  with  the  assumption  Eqs.(1)  yield  the  Lorentz  transformation
 
between any two usual inertial coordinate systems [2-4]. Though the assumption Eqs.(1) was not explicitly
articulated, evidently having been considered self-evident, Einstein said in 1907:  “Since  the  propagation
2-
velocity of light in empty space is c with respect to both reference systems, the two equations, x1
2=0, must be equivalent.” [2]. Leaving aside a discussion of whether postulate
c2t1
(i)  implies  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  the
reciprocity of relative velocities between any two usual inertial coordinate systems, we know that the two

equivalent  equations,  the  linearity  of  transformation  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  velocities  lead  to  the
Lorentz  transformation.  Some  physicists  explicitly  articulated  the  assumption  Eqs.(1)  in  their  works  on
the topic. Pauli wrote: “This also implies the validity of Euclidean geometry and the homogeneous nature
of  space  and  time.”  [3].  Fock  said:  “The  logical  foundation  of  these  methods  is,  in  principle,  the
hypothesis that Euclidean geometry is applicable to real physical space together with further assumptions,
viz. that rigid bodies exist and that light travels in straight lines.” [4].

Introducing the four-dimensional usual inertial coordinate system {xk}, k=1,2,3,4, x4=ict, and the

Minkowskian structure of gravity-free spacetime in this coordinate system,

dS 2=d

ijdxidxj,  i,j=1,2,3,4,

(2)

Minkowski [5] showed in 1909 that the Lorentz transformation is just a rotation in this spacetime. He also
showed how to use the four-dimensional tensor analysis for writing invariant physical laws with respect to
the  Lorentz  transformation.  The  Minkowskian  structure  Eq.(2)  is  a  four-dimensional  version  of  the
assumption Eqs.(1).

Conceptually,  the  principle  of  relativity  means  that  there  exists  a  class  of  equivalent  inertial
frames  of  reference,  any  one  of  which  moves  with  a  non-zero  constant  velocity  relative  to  any  other.
Einstein wrote in his Autobiographical Notes: “in a given inertial frame of reference the coordinates mean
the  results  of  certain  measurements  with  rigid  (motionless)  rods,  a  clock  at  rest  relative  to  the  inertial
frame of reference defines a local time, and the local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized
clocks and taken together, give the time of this inertial frame of reference.” [6]. As defined  by  Einstein,
each  of  the  equivalent  inertial  frames  of  reference  is  supplied  with  motionless,  rigid  unit  rods  of  equal
length  and  motionless,  synchronized  clocks  of  equal  running  rate.  Then  in  each  inertial  frame  of
reference, an observer can employ his own  motionless-rigid rods and motionless-synchronized clocks in
the so-called “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method to measure
space  and  time  intervals.  By  using  this  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”
measurement  method,  the  observer  in  each  inertial  frame  of  reference  can  set  up  his  own  usual  inertial
coordinate system {xr,t}, r=1,2,3. Postulate (ii) means that the speed of light is measured to be the same
constant  c  in  every  such  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  Recent  null  experiments  searching  for  the
anisotropy in the one-way speed of light support this postulate [7,8].

The  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method  is  not  the
only one that each inertial frame of reference has. We imagine, for each inertial frame of reference, other
measurement  methods  that  are  different  from  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized
clock”  measurement  method.  By  taking  these  other  measurement  methods,  an  observer  in  each  inertial
frame  of  reference  can  set  up  other  inertial  coordinate  systems,  just  as  well  as  he  can  set  up  his  usual
inertial  coordinate  system  by  taking  the    “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”
measurement  method.  We  call  these  other  inertial  coordinate  systems  the  unusual  inertial  coordinate
systems.  Conventional  believe  in  flatness  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  is  natural.  But  question  is,  in
which inertial coordinate system the gravity-free space and time directly display their flatness. The special
theory  of  relativity  recognizes  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  as  shown  in  the  assumption  Eqs.(1).
Making a different choice, we take one of the unusual inertial coordinate systems, say {x’r,t’}, r=1,2,3, the
primed  inertial  coordinate  system.  We  assume  that  gravity-free  space  and  time  possess  the  flat  metric
structures  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  and  hence,  the  following  generalized  Finslerian
structures in the usual inertial coordinate system [9,10],

We  modify  the  special  theory  of  relativity  by  combining  the  alternative  assumption  Eqs.(3),
instead of the assumption Eqs.(1), with the two postulates (i) and (ii). If we define a new type of velocity,
y’s=dx’s/dt’, s=1,2,3, in the primed inertial coordinate system and keep the well-defined usual (Newtonian)
velocity ys=dxs/dt, s=1,2,3, in the usual inertial coordinate system, we find from the assumption Eqs.(3),

where y’=(y’sy’s)1/2 and y=(ysys)1/2, s=1,2,3. It is understood that two different measurement methods can be
applied to a motion when it is observed in an inertial frame of reference, one being the “motionless-rigid
rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method,  the  other  one  being  associated  with  the
primed  inertial  coordinate  system.  As  a  result,  two  different  velocities,  usual  velocity  ys  and  primed
velocity y’s (of the new type), are obtained. These two velocities are related by Eqs.(4) and (5). Velocities
ys and y’s are two different versions of the motion obtained via two different measurement methods taken
in the inertial frame of reference. Velocity y’s, s=1,2,3, varies uniquely with ys and equals ys only when ys
vanishes. The Galilean addition among primed velocities links up with the Einstein addition among usual
velocities [11]. Actually, in the one-dimensional case, it is easily seen that

y’2= y’1 -u’=(c/2)ln[(c+y1)/(c-y1)] -(c/2)ln[(c+u)/(c-u)]

and

imply

y’2=(c/2)ln[(c+y2)/(c-y2)]

y2=(y1-u)/(1-y1u/c2).
In Eq.(5), as y goes to c, we get an infinite primed speed,

Speed c’ is invariant in the primed inertial coordinate systems simply because of the invariance of speed c
in the usual inertial coordinate systems. Speed c’ is actually a new version of the light speed, its version in
the primed inertial coordinate systems.

Let  IFR1  and  IFR2  be  two  inertial  frames  of  reference,  where  IFR2  moves  with  a  non-zero
constant velocity relative to IFR1. IFR1 and IFR2 can use their own “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-
synchronized  clock”  measurement  methods  and  set  up  their  own  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems
{xr
m,t’m},  m=1,2.
Since  the  propagation  velocity  of  light  is  c’  in  both  {x’r
2,t’2},  we  have  two  equivalent
equations,

m,tm},  m=1,2.  They  can  also  set  up  their  own  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems  {x’r

1,t’1}  and  {x’r

Using Eqs.(3) with y=c, we have further two equivalent equations,

Two  equivalent  equations  (7),  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  two  {x’r

m,t’m},  the
reciprocity of relative primed velocities between two {x’r
m,t’m}, and the flat structures of gravity-free space
and  time  in  two  {x’r
m,t’m}  will  lead  to  the  c’-type  Galilean  transformation  between  two  primed  inertial
coordinate  systems  {x’r
m,t’m},  under  which  speed  c’  is  invariant.  Two  equivalent  equations  (8),  the
linearity  of  transformation  between  two  {xr
m,tm},  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  usual  velocities  between
two  {xr
m,tm}  will  lead  to  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  between  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems  {xr
m,tm},  where  the  space  and  time  differentials  respectively  take  places  of  the  space  and  time
variables in the Lorentz transformation. The modified special relativity theory keeps the constancy of the
one-way  speed  of  light  and  the  local  Lorentz  invariance  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.
Nevertheless, the modified special relativity theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite speed
c’  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  and  finite  speed  c  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  It
involves the c’-type Galilean transformation between any two primed inertial coordinate systems and the
localized Lorentz transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate systems.

Metric tensors grs(y) and g(y) in Eqs.(3) or metric tensor gij(z) in Eqs.(9) depend or depends only
on directional variables ys or zs, s=1,2,3. The geometry specified by metric tensors grs(y) and g(y) or metric
tensor gij(z) can be studied and described through the generalized Finsler geometry [12].

(10a)
(10b)

Finsler  geometry  is  a  kind  of  generalization  of  Riemann  geometry,  while  generalized  Finsler
geometry  is  a  kind  of  generalization  of  Finsler  geometry.  In  generalized  Finsler  geometry,  distance  ds
between two neighboring points xk and xk+dxk, k=1,2,---,n is defined by

ds2=gij(xk,dxk)dxidxj, 

where metric tensor gij(xk,dxk) depends on directional variables dxk as well as coordinate variables xk and
satisfies

gij(xk,dxk)=gji(xk,dxk),
gij(xk,l dxk)=gij(xk,dxk)  for l >0.
det[gij(xk,dxk)] „ 0, and
gij(xk,dxk)dxidxj>0,  i,j=1,2,---,n, for non-zero vector dxi.

Like Finsler geometry, the generalized Finsler geometry can be endowed with the Cartan connection [12].
In our case that metric tensor gij(z), i,j=1,2,3,4, depends only on four-dimensional directional variables zk,
k=1,2,3,4, according to the Cartan connection, we have

Dzk=dzk, k=1,2,3,4,
 h , h=1,2,3,4,

h= ¶

where  Dzk  is  the  absolute  differential  of  zk  and  (cid:209)
[10].

h  is  the  covariant  partial  derivative  of  the  first  kind

Since  it  is  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method
that we use in our experiments, the physical principle in the modified special relativity theory is: The c’-
type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system plus the transformation from the primed
inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate system. In the primed inertial coordinate system,
we  write  all  physical  laws  in  the  c’-type  Galilean-invariant  form,  we  do  calculations  in  the  c’-type
Galilean-invariant manner, and we finally transform all results from the primed inertial coordinate system
to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  and  compare  them  to  experimental  facts  in  the  usual  inertial
coordinate  system.  The  transformation  from  the  primed  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems  is  an
important part of the new physical principle. If two axes x’r and xr, where r runs 1,2,3, are set to have the
same direction and the same origin, the transformation is

dx’r=K(y)dxr, r=1,2,3,

dt’=(1-y2/c2)1/2dt 

and

This transformation links the Galilean transformation between any two primed inertial coordinate systems
up with the localized Lorentz transformation between two corresponding usual inertial coordinate systems
[10].

The  light  speed  that  owns  the  constancy  in  all  inertial  frames  of  reference  has  two  versions:
infinite speed c’ in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c in the usual inertial coordinate
system.  We  deal  with  this  constant  in  such  a  way  that  it  has  the  value  of  c’  in  the  primed  inertial
coordinate system and of c in the usual inertial coordinate system.

Now  we  apply  this  principle  to  reform  of  mechanics  and  field  theory.  The  c’-type  Galilean-

invariant motion equation in the primed inertial coordinate system is

F’k=m0dz’k/dt’, k=1,2,3,4,

where m0 is the mass of an object, F’k is the four-dimensional force, z’k=dx’k/dt’, k=1,2,3,4, and the locally
Lorentz-invariant motion equation in the usual inertial coordinate system is

Fk=m0Dzk/dt’, k=1,2,3,4.

Using Eq.(13), we obtain

Fk=m0dzk/dt’, k=1,2,3,4,

as the motion equation in the usual inertial coordinate system.

In the primed inertial coordinate system, the c’-type Galilean-invariant four-dimensional energy-

momentum vector of a moving particle with rest mass m0 is
p’k=m0z’k  =(m0y’1, m0y’2, m0y’3, im0c’), k=1,2,3,4. 

 

Acting the transformation from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate systems on it, we find
pk=( m0y’r/K(y), im0c’/G(y))=( m0yr/[1-y2/c2]1/2, im0c/[1-y2/c2]1/2)

p’k ﬁ

= m0z k, k=1,2,3,4, r=1,2,3,

as  the  four-dimensional  energy-momentum  vector  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  Immediately
calculating the trace of tensor pipj, i,j=1,2,3,4, yields
2c2, y<c,

Sp(pipj)= -m0

(21)

    0, y=c.

Its familiar form is

E2=c2 p • p +m0

2c4,

where  p =(p1, p2, p3), E=-icp4, and E is the energy of the moving particle.

The  change  of  assumption  from  Eqs.(1)  to  Eqs.(3)  has  no  effect  on  the  validity  of  relativistic
mechanics  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  However,  the  equations  regarding  the  invariant  of

The gauging procedure adopted in the current field theory to make a field system locally gauge-
invariant with respect to a certain gauge group is still effective in the primed inertial coordinate  system.
As we perform the transformation from the primed to the usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  we  can  find
the version of this procedure in the usual inertial coordinate system. For example, in the primed  inertial

It  is  the  most  remarkable  feature  of  the  field  theory  in  the  framework  of  the  modified  special
relativity  theory  that  the  concept  of  particle  size  has  its  own  room.  All  particles  properly  display
themselves in the primed inertial coordinate system. Particle size defined in the primed inertial coordinate
system is an invariant quantity. It can be quite involved in our invariant calculations. It should be noted,
however, that the concept of particle size in the primed inertial coordinate system is different from that we
tried  but  failed  to  introduce  in  the  current  Lorentz-invariant  field  theory.  We  shall  discuss    it  in  detail
elsewhere.

In  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  any  field  system  can  be  quantized  by  use  of  the
canonical  quantization  method.  As  instantaneity  is  a  covariant  concept,  the  equal-time  commutation  or
anti-commutation  relations  are  reasonable.  As  canonically  conjugate  variables  are  contravariant  to
original field variables, the commutation or anti-commutation relations are also of tensor equations,

As  the  light  speed  c’  is  infinite,  the  essentially  instantaneous  quantum  connection  is  acceptable.  As  the
primed  time  differential  dt’  is  invariant,  the  time-ordered  product  in  the  perturbation  expansion  of  S-
matrix is definite. In the primed inertial coordinate system, the state vector equation of a quantized field
system is

where H’ is the Hamiltonian of the system, F

’ a state vector and W

’ an operator.

How  is  a  quantized  field  system  transformed  under  the  transformation  from  the  primed  to  the
usual inertial coordinates systems? If we denote the operator of this quantized field system in the primed
inertial  coordinate  system  by  W
’,  and  denoting  those  of  the  transformed
quantized field system in the usual inertial coordinate system by W
and  F ?  A  transformation  law  has  been  established  to  answer  this  question  [10].  It  says:  any  quantized
field  system  will  undergo  a  unitary  transformation  under  the  transformation  from  the  primed  inertial
coordinate system to the usual inertial coordinate systems. In general, for a quantized field system, we can
find a unitary transformation U such that

The  divergence  difficulties  in  the  current  Lorentz-invariant  quantum  field  theory  have  been
already ascribed to the model of point particle. But all attempts to assign a finite size to a particle failed.
According  to  the  special  relativity  theory,  particle  size  is  not  a  covariant  concept.  It  has  been  unknown
how  to  carry  out  the  Lorentz-invariant  calculations  based  on  such  a  size.  The  Lorentz  invariance
recognizes the light speed c constituting a limitation for transport of matter or energy and transmission of
information  or  causal  connection.  The  law  of  causality  rejects  any  instantaneous  processes  between  two
events at distinct space points. It is very hard to explain how a sized particle as a whole is set in motion
when a force acts on it at its edge. It is very hard to explain how the quantum connection specified by the
quantum mechanics theory can be instantaneous. Also, as pointed  out  by  Poincare  [13],  the  field  energy
and momentum of a sized electron, in the framework of the special relativity theory, do not have correct
transformation properties, unlike its mechanical energy and momentum, though they are finite. That will
result in different values when we compute some quantities, f.g. the total mass of the sized electron.

All  of  these  alter  in  the  modified  special  relativity  theory.  In  the  primed  inertial  coordinate
system,  the  concept  of  particle  size  is  a  proper  concept,  it  is  c’-type  Galilean-invariant.  The  light  speed
constituting  a  limitation  for  the  matter  or  energy  transport  and  the  information  or  causal  connection
transmission in the primed inertial coordinate system is c’, infinite. The field energy and momentum of a
sized  particle  form  a  vector  as  well  as  its  mechanical  energy  and  momentum.  In  the  primed  inertial
coordinate  system,  all  particles  properly  exhibit  their  own  size.  As  a  matter  of  course,  we  have  a
convergent  and  c’-type  Galilean-invariant  quantum  field  theory  for  any  quantized  field  system  in  the

inertial  coordinate  systems,  the  unitary  transformation  does  not  change  the  eigenvalue  spectrums  of
operators  of  this  quantized  field  system,  the  expectation  values  of  its  observations,  and  its  operator  and
state vector equations. We hence have a convergent and invariant quantum field theory for the quantized
field system in the usual inertial coordinate system. Since it is  the localized Lorentz transformation that
stands  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  we  indeed  have  a  convergent  and  locally
Lorentz-invariant  quantum  field  theory  for  the  quantized  field  system  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate
system.

The  modified  special  relativity  theory  and  the  quantum  mechanics  theory  together  found  a

convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

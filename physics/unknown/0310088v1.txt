Introduction 

the  phenomena  of  molecular 

Drawing  macroscopic  analogies  on 

level  establishes 
relationships  between  two  approaches  to  studying  structure  of  substance  –  large-downward  (top-
down)  and  small-upward  (bottom-up)  ones.  In  this  connection,  molecular  machine  presents  an 
image  which  could  be  characterized  not  only  by  the  features  that  reside  in  ordinary  systems  of 
molecular  level,  but  also  by  the  terms  that  describe  large  constructions.  Of  course,  dynamics  of 
molecular machine, generally, a set of components (molecules, groups of atoms), is stochastic to a 
great  extent  [1].  That  is  caused  by  movement  of  elements  of  machine  by  the  mechanism  of 
restricted  diffusion  [2].  Nevertheless,  at  appropriate  influence  components  can  make  movements 
similar  to  mechanical  –  predominance  of  large-scale  displacements  in  a  certain  direction  and 
conformational  transitions  are  observed.  Well  experimentally  investigated  example  of  molecular 
machines is catenanes, the compounds consisting of two interlocked molecular rings [3].

co-conformer  [B+]  is  the  basis  of  the  device.  (B)  Proposed  mechanochemical  mechanism  for  the  operation  of  the 
molecular switch.  (Reproduced from [4] with courteous permission of the authors). 

Practical application of catenanes has been already investigated in light of their possible use 
as semi-conductor switches in logic circuits of elementary computers [4]. In the proposed model the 
catenane, being between two electrodes, changes its oxidation status under the action of an external 
electric  field.  Herewith,  rotation  of  one  ring  in  the  cavity  of  another  occurs  accompanied  by  its 
fixation at certain moments of the influence (fig. 1). Such fixation, in principle, is possible owing to 
catenane being put as a monomolecular film between closely located plane electrodes. On given on 
fig.  1  mechanochemical  scheme  co-conformer  [A0]  represents  both  the  ground-state  state  of  the 
[2]catenane and the “switch open” state of the device (no current flows). When the [2]catenane is 
oxidized  (by  applying  a  bias  of  -1.5  V  )  the  tetrathiafulvalene  groups  (at  the  right  in  left  ring  in 
[A0]) are ionized and experiences Coulomb repulsion with the tetracationic cyclophane (right ring), 
resulting  in  circumrotation  of  the  ring  and  formation  of  co-conformer  [B+].    When  the  voltage  is 
reduced  to  a  near-zero  bias,  co-conformer  [B0]  is formed, and this represents the “switch closed” 
state of the device (0.2 µA current flows). Partial reduction of the cyclophane (at an applied bias of 

 

1

+2 V) is necessary to regenerate [A0] co-conformer. Thus, the device can be brought to the closed 
state (when the current flows) and to the open state (when the current doesn’t flow) cyclically.  

As  a  result  of  the  aforesaid,  the  purpose  of  the  present  work  is  a  computer  simulation  of 
dynamics  of  the  model  [2]catenane  which  electroconductive  properties  are  supposed  to  be 
connected with its conformation. Investigation methods in silico (computer-simulated) meanwhile 
represent  a  unique  way  to  study  in  detail  dynamic  correlations  in  such  systems;  and  till  now 
molecular dynamics of catenanes hasn’t been studied in connection with their functional properties, 
only  semi-empirical  quantum  chemical  calculations  [5]  and  simulation  of  neutron  scattering  with 
use  of  molecular  dynamics  [6,7]  were  carried  out.  In  given  article  main  types  of  the  movements 
occurring in the catenane are considered. 

Objects and methods of research 
Geometrical  optimization  of  three  cationic  forms  of  (2)-(cyclo-bis(paraquat-p-phenylene))-

(1(2,6)-tetrathiafulvalena-16(1,5)naphtalena-3,6,9,12,15,17,20,23,26,29-decaoxatriacontaphane)-
catenane [8](catA0, catB+ и catAB#, fig. 1) and quantum chemical calculation of molecular charge 
distribution  of  the  molecule  became  the  first  stage  of  the  work.  Restricted  Hartree-Fock  method 
with open shells was used, and the optimization was carried in STO-3G basis with descent in TRIM 
(Trust Image Radius Minimization, [9]), one of the quasi-Newton-Raphson method varieties. The 
partial  charges  were  calculated  according  to  Loewdin.  The  whole  quantum  chemical  set  of 
calculations  was  executed  in  software  package  GAMESS©  (General  Atomic  and  Molecular 
Electronic System Structure, [10]). 
Comparative analysis of existing atom types of Amber99© force field used in calculation of 
classical molecular dynamics was done further. Taking into account the geometry of the structures 
optimized to some extent (gradient on the final step of the optimization came to less than 0,001%  
of the final energy and was of one order more than final gradient recommended for calculation of 
small molecules), new types of atoms, bonds, valent and torsion angles were assigned. In particular, 
new  types  of  atoms  which  form  new  types  of  bonds  and  angles,  having  intermediate  values  of 
rigidity constant among well-known analogues, were set up in correspondence to all heavy atoms of 
tetrathiafulvalene and naphthalene units and two bipyridines. Charges were assigned according to 
the previous quantum chemical calculations.  
The following stage of the work was an investigation of the catenane at the level of molecular 
mechanical  approximation.  The  calculation  was  carried  out  in  package  MoDyP©  [11].  Molecular 
dynamics  was  conducted  for  one  chosen  molecule  of  the  catenane  under  different  conditions, 
common of which were the step of integration, 0.001 ps, and combined use of NVT and collision 
thermostats (average frequency of collisions with virtual particles was 100 per ps per atom, weight 
of  the  particles  was  18  a.w.u.),  and  also  radiuses  of  truncating  for  Coulomb  and  Van-der-Waals 
interactions  –  15  Ǻ  and  12  Ǻ  correspondingly.  Temperature  varied  from  300  K  to  2000  K.  The 
range  of  trajectories  length  was  from  10  ns  to  1  µs.  Also  a  set  of  trajectories  (each  has  10  ns  in 
length), in which frequency of external electric field (0.0001 – 10 ns-1) was varying, was calculated 
for catA0. The choice of the magnitude value of external electric field imposed upon the system in 
some calculations, 7.2·106 V/cm, is conditioned on that it corresponds to such field which is created 
by a point charge 2e- at a distance of 20 Ǻ in vacuum (20 Ǻ is a characteristic size of the catenane; 
the  catenane  can  be  freely  placed  in  a  cube  with  sides  of  such  length).  Besides,  the  dynamics  of 
catA0 with cyclophane ring (CPH) being fixed and with tetrathiafulvalene ring (TTF) being fixed 
was monitored (lengths of trajectories amount to 100 ns, set temperature was 300 K). 

In addition to visual representation of results, the quantitative analysis of molecules’ mobility 
depending  on  above-listed  parameters  was  carried  out.  Time  dependences  of  rotation  angles, 
angular  velocities,  angular  and  dipole  moments  for  CPH  and  TTF,  auto-  and  crosscorrelation 
functions of these quantities, spectral Fourier expansion on frequency dependences of the quantities 
were calculated. The angle of rotation for a ring was determined as the angle on which a projection 
of radius-vector drawn out of the ring’s centre of masses to an atom chosen at one’s own rotates in 
the ring’s plane from initial position. The plane of a ring was set as a bidimentional space stretched 
on orts of basis obtained by orthogonalization of two vectors connecting two pairs of atoms in the 

 

2

ring.  The  chosen  vectors  are  symmetric  relative  to  an  axis  of  the  second  order  symmetry  if 
considered  relative  to  the  planar  formula  of  the  ring.  Four  sp3-atoms  of  carbon  diametrically 
located  by  pairs  in  corners  of  the  "quadrangular"  ring  were  the  base  for  the  reference  vectors  in 
CPH ring. In TTF ring the base was the atoms of oxygen of the crown-ether bridges; these atoms 
constrain  naphthalene  and  tetrathiafulvalene,  most  structurally  rigid  elements  of  the  ring,  and 
therefore present the most suitable reference points that could be used at assignment of a plane in 
the ring, rather flexible, as a whole, structure. 

Results and discussion 

Quantum chemical calculations have correctly reflected that catA0 is oxidized to catB+ very due to 
sulfur of tetrathiafulvalene unit, as well as at reduction catA0 → catAB# nitrogen of bipyridine is 
reduced first of all. Pyridine rings in catA carry a charge close to +1. Thus, the total charge of CPH 
is equal to +3.97 and the charge of TTF is equal to +0.03. In much the same manner, in catB+ the 
charge of CPH is close to +4 and the charge of TTF is close to +1. In catAB# the charge of CPH ≈ 
+2, the charge of TTF ≈ 0. π-electron acceptor status of the charged cyclophane ring’s bipyridine 
nitrogens and π-electron donor status of the tetrathiafulvalene ring’s nonoxidized sulfur are seen in 
such system, as it was noted in [12].

Fig. 2. Density of states of rotation angles of the rings in [A0] co-conformer at 300 K (a) and at 2 000 K (b). Zero on 
both axes corresponds to initial state. 

At temperature 300 K rotation of rings on more than 180˚ occurs in none of the catenane’s co-
conformers in the period of trajectory length (no more than 1 µs). At 2 000 K such rotation takes 
place only in catA0 one time per 30 ns on average, and it was observed only for TTF ring. Taking 
into account known experimental data on energy of activation in similar catenanes (10 kcal/mol), it 
is possible to assume that at room temperature rotation is possible with times of about several tens 
of milliseconds. The distribution on angles of rotation of CPH and TTF rings around their axes is 
shown on fig. 2. One can see that with increase of temperature the area of TTF rotation angle equal 
to +50˚ begins to be filled up in addition to symmetric area with angle -50˚. At that CPH ring does 
not  change  its  distribution  on  angles  with  increase  of  temperature.  It  really  points  out  the 
importance  of  TTF’s  rotation,  and  not  of  CPH’s  one,  for  the  cyclic  transition  according  to  the 
scheme on fig. 1. Consideration of dipole moments of the rings also leads to the similar conclusion. 
If considering correlation time of dipole moment of a ring as a measure of how greatly electrostatic 
effects  influence  the  coordination  of  internal  movements  in  time  one  can  see  that  with  fixed 
strongly charged CPH other ring (TTF) moves more coordinately than with TTF being fixed CPH 
does  (fig.  3).  The  fact  that  correlation  time  for  CPH’s  dipole  moment  almost  doesn’t  depend  on 
fixing of the rings tells also about initially smaller rotational mobility of CPH.

Specified correlation times (tens of picoseconds at standard temperature) of dipole moments 
correspond to "trembling" movements of atomic groups in the rings and do not correspond at all to 
rotary  movement  of  the  rings  since  the  former  are  identical  to  all  cationic  forms  of  the  catenane 
whereas  rings  in  catB+  and  catAB#  during  300  ns  haven’t  made  full  rotations  even  at  2000  K,  in 
contrast to TTF ring in catA0. 

 The same times can be obtained from dependence of autocorrelation times of dipole moments 
on frequency of external electric field (fig. 4). The matter is that dipole molecules have time to be 
oriented under action of external field if period of its fluctuations is more than relaxation time. If 
period of the field fluctuations is of the same order of value as relaxation time molecules have time 
to  return  to  initial  chaotic  state  during  changing  of  the  field  sign.  There  is  an  abrupt  decrease  of 
orientational polarization in appropriate area of frequencies. Herewith, energy is partially absorbed 
by  substance  as  the  field  acts  against  disorienting  forces  in  substance.  This  area  is  an  area  of 
abnormal  dispersion  of  electric  waves.  Absorption  of  electric  waves  results  in  dielectric  losses. 
Abnormal dispersion and dielectric losses arise in liquids at frequencies about ν = 1 / τ ≈ 1011 sec-1. 
It follows from the formula [13]:

where  η  denotes  liquid  viscosity,  and  σ  denotes  effective  molecular  radius.  Characteristic 
quenching time is tens of picoseconds for such molecule as catA0. So decrease of autocorrelation 
times of dipole moments (as well as angular ones) occurs at frequency of about 0.1 ps-1 (fig. 4).

Fourier expansion of angular velocities of the rings’ rotation (fig. 5) was used for finding out 
movement’s  characteristic  frequencies.  It  is  impossible  to  pick  out  definite  modes  in  rotation  of 
CPH ring; actually, its movement is completely disorderly. The prevalence of low (less than 1 ns-1) 
frequencies  over  common  noise  is  visible  in  rotation  of  TTF  ring.  Nevertheless,  the  factor 
determining stochasticity, i.e. common noise, is present. The main maxima lay outside the area of 
discretizaton for such Fourier spectrum (less than 1 ms-1).

Characteristic  values  of  quenching  times  for  autocorrelation  functions  of  rotation  angles  of 
both of rings in catA0 amount to 900 ps for CPH and 1500 ps for TTF at 300 K (fig. 6). In this way, 
large-scale  rotations  occur  in  a  period  much  more  than  correlation  time  of  rotation  angles,  and 
dynamics  of  rings’  movement  is  determined,  substantially,  by  stochastic  rotation  of  the  rings 
accompanied by bending movements of crown-ether bridges of TTF.

Crosscorrelation of rotation angles is rather weak; maxima are seen on times of nanosecond 

order (fig. 7). That is to say there is a coordination at the level of bending movements.

Conclusions 
The studying of catA0 dynamics shows presence of two types of constituent rings’ movement: 
large-scale  rotation  of  TTF  ring  through  angles  more  than  180º  and  rapid  disorderly  rotary 
movements of both rings. At that more than one full rotation of weakly charged TTF ring occurs 
during  1  ms  only  at  high  temperatures,  at  room  temperature  it  should  occur  in  a  period  too 
excessive  for  machine  counting  –  tens  of  milliseconds.  The  other  ring  does  not  rotate  through 
significant angles in any investigated cases. In co-conformers catB+ and catAB# rings do not rotate 
greatly  during  100  ns  even  at  2000  K.  It  remains  only  to  suppose  that  assigned  distribution  of 
charges  is  essential  factor  in  rotation  of  the  rings;  but  nevertheless,  the  assignment  is  well 
coordinated  to  known  data  from  electrochemistry  [14].  It  is  necessary  to  note,  that  at  trial

simulation of dynamics of cationic form catA+ (fig. 1) TTF ring makes CPH ring turn through 180º 
in  first  several  nanoseconds,  turning  thus  into  co-conformer  catB+  (charge  distribution  was  taken 
identical  for  both  forms).  Further  reverse  rotation  of  such  scale  does  not  occur  during  the 
calculation. Similarly, behavior of catAB# is described within the framework of the scheme on fig. 
1  as  well  –  during  the  calculation  (total  duration  100  ns)  CPH  ring  was  remaining  mostly  in  a 
position between naphthalene and tetratiafulvalene units, i.e. was strung on the crown-ether bridge. 
The movements of different time-scales can be characterized either by statistical functions of 
rotation angles and angular velocities or by spectral decomposition of the same quantities. Large-
scale  rotation  comes  to  light  the  best  in  Fourier  spectra,  bending  movements  occuring  on  times 
scales  of  nanosecond  order  –  with  help  of  correlation  analysis.  The  dielectric  relaxation  is 
concerned with "trembling" of the rings and occurs on smaller time scales. 

 So then, the total rotational movement of the rings in catenane co-conformers catA0 (catB0) 
and  catAB#  is  stochastic  but  for  TTF  ring  it  includes  selected  degrees  of  freedom  with  the 
prevalence of large-scale rotational movements in frequency contribution to the total spectrum. For 
the  most  charged  forms,  catA+  and  catB+,  rotation  through  angles  more  than  180º  is  absent  or 
occurs once at transition catA+ → catB+. Probably, it is concerned with strong influence of redox-
status.

Abstract:  Previously  in  geophysics,  only  three  heat  transport  processes  have  been 
considered:  conduction,  radiation,  and  convection  or,  more  generally,  buoyancy-driven 
mass  transport.  As  a  consequence  of  whole-Earth  decompression  dynamics,  I  add  a 
fourth,  called  mantle  decompression  thermal-tsunami,  which  may  emplace  heat  at  the 
base of the crust from a heretofore unanticipated source. 
 
Keywords:  crustal  heat,  terrestrial  heat  flow,  geodynamics,  mantle  decompression 
thermal-tsunami, whole-Earth decompression dynamics 

 
 
It  is  known  through  experience  in  deep  mines  and  with  bore-holes  that  temperature 
increases with depth in the crust. For more than half a century geophysicists have made 
measurements  of  near-surface  continental  and  oceanic  heat  flow  with  the  aim  of 
determining the Earth’s heat loss. Pollack et al.1 estimate a global heat loss of 44.2 TW (1 
TW=1012 W) based upon 24,774 observations at 20,201 sites. 
 
Numerous  attempts  have  been  made  to  reconcile  measured  global  heat  loss  with 
radionuclide  heat  production  from  various  geophysical  models  closely  involved  with 
plate tectonics. Usually, models are contrived to yield the very result they model, but in 
this  case  there  is  a  problem.  Currently  popular  models  rely  upon  radiogenic  heat  for 
geodynamic processes, geomagnetic field generation, and for  the Earth’s  heat loss. The 
problem is that radionuclides cannot even satisfy just the global heat loss requirements. 
 
Previous  estimates  of  global  heat  production  invariably  come  from  the  more-or-less 
general  assumption  that  the  Earth’s  current  heat  loss  consists  of  the  steady-state  heat 
production from long-lived radionuclides (235U, 238U, and 40K). Estimates of present-day 
global  radiogenic  heat  production,  based  upon  chondritic  abundances,  typically  range 
from  19  TW  to  31  TW.  These  represent  an upper  limit  through  the  tacit  assumption  of 
rapid heat transport irrespective of assumed radionuclide locations. The short-fall in heat 
production,  relative  to  Earth’s  measured  heat  loss1,  has  led  to  speculation  that  the 
difference might be accounted for by residual heat from Earth’s formation 4.5 × 109 years 
ago, ancient radiogenic heat from a time of greater heat production, or, perhaps, from a 
yet unidentified heat source2.

The  purpose  of  this  brief  communication  is  to  disclose  a  heretofore  unanticipated  heat 
transport  mechanism  and  heat  source  capable  of  emplacing  heat  at  the  mantle-crust-
interface at the base of the crust. 
 
The principal consequences of Earth’s formation from within a giant gaseous protoplanet 
are  profound  and  affect  virtually  all  areas  of  geophysics  in  major,  fundamental  ways3. 
Principal implications result (i) from Earth having been compressed by about 300 Earth-
masses  of  primordial  gases  which  provides  a  major  source  of  energy  for  geodynamic 
processes,  and  (ii)  from  the  deep-interior  having  a  highly-reduced  state  of  oxidation 
which results in great quantities of uranium and thorium existing within the Earth’s core, 
and  leads  to  the  feasibility  of  the  georeactor,  a  hypothesized  natural,  nuclear  fission 
reactor at the center of the Earth as the energy source for the geomagnetic field4-7. These 
consequences have led to a different way of envisioning geodynamics, recently published 
in Current Science8 , called whole-Earth decompression dynamics. 
 
Formation of the Earth as the rock-plus-alloy kernel of a giant gaseous Jupiter-like planet, 
as I have shown3,9,10, leads to the Earth as we know it being compressed to about 64% of 
its  present  diameter,  and  having  a  contiguous  uniform  shell  of  continental  matter 
covering  its  rocky  surface.  After  being  stripped  of  its  great,  Jupiter-like  overburden  of 
volatile  protoplanetary  constituents,  presumably  by  the  high  temperatures  and/or  by  the 
violent activity, such as T Tauri-phase solar wind11-13, associated with the thermonuclear 
ignition of the Sun, the Earth would inevitably begin to decompress, to rebound toward a 
new hydrostatic equilibrium. The initial whole-Earth decompression is expected to result 
in a global system of major primary cracks appearing in the rigid crust which persist and 
are  identified  as  the  global,  mid-oceanic  ridge  system,  just  as  explained  by  Earth 
expansion  theory.  But  here  the  similarity  with  that  theory  ends.  Whole-Earth 
decompression  dynamics  sets  forth  a  different  mechanism  for  whole-Earth  dynamics 
which  involves  the  formation  of  secondary  decompression  cracks  and  the  in-filling  of 
those cracks, a process which is not limited to the last 200 million years, the maximum 
age of the seafloor. 
 
As the Earth subsequently decompresses and swells from within, the deep interior shells 
may be expected to adjust to changes in radius and curvature by plastic deformation. As 
the Earth decompresses, the area of the Earth’s rigid surface increases by the formation of 
secondary decompression cracks often located near the continental margins and presently 
identified  as  submarine 
trenches.  These  secondary  decompression  cracks  are 
subsequently in-filled with basalt, extruded from the mid-oceanic ridges, which traverses 
the ocean floor by gravitational creep, ultimately plunging into secondary decompression 
cracks, thus emulating subduction, but without necessitating mantle convection. 
 
One of the consequences of Earth formation as a giant, gaseous, Jupiter-like planet9, as 
described  by  whole-Earth  decompression  dynamics8,10,14,  is  the  existence  of  a  vast 
reservoir  of  energy,  the  stored  energy  of  protoplanetary  compression,  available  for 
driving  geodynamic  processes  related  to  whole-Earth  decompression.  Some  of  that 
energy, I submit, is emplaced as heat at the mantle-crust-interface at the base of the crust 
through  the  process  of  mantle  decompression  thermal-tsunami.  Moreover,  some

radionuclide heat may not necessarily contribute directly to crustal heating, but rather to 
replacing  the  lost  heat  of  protoplanetary  compression,  which  helps  to  facilitate  mantle 
decompression. 
 
Previously  in  geophysics,  only  three  heat  transport  processes  have  been  considered: 
conduction,  radiation,  and  convection  or,  more  generally,  buoyancy-driven  mass 
transport.  As  a  consequence  of  whole-Earth  decompression  dynamics,  I  add  a  fourth, 
called mantle decompression thermal-tsunami.  
 
As  the  Earth  decompresses,  heat  must  be  supplied  to  replace  the  lost  heat  of 
protoplanetary  compression.  Otherwise,  decompression  would  lower  the  temperature, 
which would impede the decompression process. 
 
Heat generated within the core from actinide decay and/or fission15 may enhance mantle 
decompression  by  replacing  the  lost  heat  of  protoplanetary  compression.  The  resulting 
decompression, beginning at the bottom of the mantle, will tend to propagate throughout 
the mantle, like a tsunami, until it reaches the impediment posed by the base of the crust. 
There, crustal rigidity opposes continued decompression, pressure builds and compresses 
matter  at  the  mantle-crust-interface,  resulting  in  compression  heating.  Ultimately, 
pressure  is  released  at  the  surface  through  volcanism  and  through  secondary 
decompression crack formation and/or enlargement. 
 
Mantle decompression thermal-tsunami, as outlined above, poses a new explanation for a 
portion  of  the  internal  heat  being  lost  from  the  Earth.  It  may  prove  as  well  to  be  a 
significant energy source for earthquakes and volcanism, as these geodynamic processes 
appear concentrated along secondary decompression cracks.

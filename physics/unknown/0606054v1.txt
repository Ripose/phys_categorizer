Introduction 

In  recent  years  much  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  development  of  scintillation  counters,  in 

which  light  produced  in  scintillating  plastic  is  detected  by  semiconductive  avalanche  photo-diodes 

(APD). These modern devices represent an alternative to traditional counters equipped with PMT and 

possess numerous advantages which may make them a preferred solution for many applications. The 

most  important  features  of  APD  are  compactness,  no  requirement  for  special  housing  and  light-

conductors,  low  supply  voltage,  low  power  consumption  and,  finally,  significantly  lower  price  than 

that of PMT.  

START,  a  Scintillation  Tile  with  MRS  APD  Light  Readout  [1],  is  the  first  successful 

implementation of the technique described above. It has been developed by our group with the purpose 

of  constructing  a  large-scale  triggering  system  for  cosmic  muons.  As  described  in  Ref. [1],  START 

consists  of  a  rectangular  plate  cut  of  scintillating  plastic,  a  piece  of  WLS  fiber  stored  in  a  circular 

groove 

inside 

this  plate  and 

two  micro-pixel  avalanche  photodiodes  with  metal–resistor–

semiconductor  structure  (MRS  APD)  positioned  in  special  cavities  inside  the  plate  and  operated  in 

coincidence.  An  electronic  card,  expressly  developed  for  this  application,  is  fastened  directly  to  the 

START  body.  It  provides  power  supply,  signal  readout  and  contains  the  coincidence  circuit.  The 

rectangular shape of START makes it possible to assemble unrestrictedly large triggering planes with

source. 

MRS  APD1  represents  a  new  generation  of  silicon  photo-sensors,  which  are  concurrently 

developed  by  several  manufacturers.  Operated  in  the  Geiger  mode,  MRS  APD  is  naturally  a  rather 

noisy  device.  The  noise  rate  measured  at  the  position  of  the  single-photoelectron  peak  at  room 

temperature  is  normally  found  in  the  range  of  1–3 MHz  [2].  However,  significant  increase  in  the 

quantum  efficiency  of  MRS  APD  and  effective  suppression  of  cross-photo-ionization  between 

neighboring  micro-cells,  achieved  during  the  last  decade  [2,3],  have  driven  MRS  APD  to  perform 

better than other similar devices (see, for instance, Ref. [4]). Therefore, read-out of scintillation light 

from a WLS fiber by a pair of MRS APDs, operated in coincidence, could result in negligible overall 

noise of START, despite the noise coming from individual MRS APDs. 

2.  Setup and results 

To measure the noise characteristics and efficiency of START in response to cosmic partilces, a 

tested  START  sample,  sized  15  ×  15  ×  1.5 cm3,  was  placed  in  the  center  between  two  scintillation 

counters with plastic dimensions of 14  × 14 × 1 cm3,  positioned  1.7 m  apart.  Coincidence of signals 

from the scintillation counters was used to trigger the passage of ionizing particles through START.  

Signals  coming  from  the  two  MRS  APDs  were  fed  to  discriminators  with  variable  thresholds, 

which produced 50 ns-long NIM pulses. These pulses were then sent to two coincidence circuits with 

time gates of 100 ns,  one  of  the  pulses being delayed for 250 ns  before  arrival at the second circuit. 

Thus, the first circuit triggered real coincidences (true START signals), while the second one allowed 

monitoring  of  accidental  coincidences  (false  START  signals,  or  noise).  Individual  noise  rates  of  the 

MRS APDs, F1 and F2, were measured as well. Changes of the threshold values were applied to both 

discriminators  simultaneously.  The  rate  of  accidental  coincidences  was  found  to  be  equal  to  F1 F2 × 

100 ns within 5% of accuracy at all thresholds, which proved the absence of cross-talks between two 

photo-diode  channels.  Shown  in  Fig. 1  are  the  rates  of  true  and  false  START  events  for  different 

discriminator  thresholds.  When  the  threshold  exceeds  100 mV  (which  is  above  the  fourth 
photoelectron peak) the noise rate becomes less than 10–2 Hz, while the signal rate flattens to a quasi-

plateau of 8–10 Hz. This value is consistent with the expected intensity of cosmic radiation.

Amplitude spectra of the two MRS APDs and a timing spectrum of START measured relative to 

the  trigger  produced  by  the  scintillation  counters  are  shown  in  Fig. 2.  After  cutting  off  the  pedestal 

events (not related to START and probably induced by high-voltage equipment positioned close to the 

setup), the efficiency of START was evaluated by counting the number of events accumulated in the 

overflow TDC channel. With the discriminating threshold set at 115 mV (which is the case for the data

in  Fig. 2)  the  efficiency  was  found  to  exceed  99%.  It  stays  this  high  within  a  wide  range  of 

discriminating  thresholds,  corresponding  to  the  quasi-plateau  in  Fig. 1.  Precise  adjustment  of  the 

thresholds for different START samples is hence not necessary, and large arrays of STARTs may be 

put into action without complicated calibration. 

3.  Conclusion 

START  is  an  excellent  building  block  for  low-noise  and  efficient  trigger  systems  for  cosmic 

muons.  Such  systems  may  possess  registration  efficiency  of  almost  100%  and  intrinsic  noise  of  less 
than 10–2 Hz. As this article is being written, the first such system, comprising about 170 STARTs, has 

been operating at CERN for nine months with no evident changes of performance. The quasi-plateau 

in  the  START  signal  rate  dependence  over  discriminating  threshold  makes  it  possible  to  avoid  any 

external  calibration  and  to  monitor  the  performance  of  large-scale  systems  only  by  measuring  the 

cosmic counting rate.

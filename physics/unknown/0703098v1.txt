Abstract 

We are addressing the optical speedup of movements 
of  layers  in  moiré  patterns.  We  introduce  a  set  of 
equations  for  computing  curved  patterns,  where  the 
formulas of optical speedup and moiré periods are kept in 
their  simplest  form.  We  consider  linear  movements  and 
rotations.  In  the  presented  notation,  all  periods  are 
relative  to  the  axis  of  movements  of  layers  and  moiré 
bands. 

Keywords:  moiré  patterns,  line  moiré,  superposition 
speedup,  moiré

Introduction 

Moiré  patterns  appear  when  superposing 
two 
transparent  layers  containing  correlated  opaque  patterns. 
The case when layer patterns comprise straight or curved 
lines is called line moiré. 

This  document  presents  the  basics  of  line  moiré 
patterns.  We  present  numerous  examples  and  we  focus 
also on the optical speedup of moiré shapes when moving 
layer patterns. Numerous examples are present. Dynamic 
examples  demonstrating  the  movements  of  layers  are 
presented by GIF files (hyperlinks are provided in square 
brackets). 

We  develop  here  the  most  important  formulas  for 
computing  the  periods  of  superposition  patterns,  the 
inclination  angles  and  the  velocities  of  optical  shapes 
when moving one of the layers. 

In section 2, we demonstrate the phenomenon on the 
examples with horizontal parallel lines, which are further 
extended  to  cases  with  inclined  and  curved  lines.  In 
section 3 we present circular examples with straight radial 
lines, which are analogously extended.

Figure 1. The lines of one layer are parallel to the lines of 
the second layer.

The  superposition 

image  does  not  change 

if 
transparent layers with their opaque patterns are inverted. 
We  denote  one  of  the  layers  as  the  base  layer  and  the 
other  one  as  the  revealing  layer.  When  considering 
printed  samples,  we  assume  that  the  revealing  layer  is 
printed on a transparency and is superposed on top of the 
base layer, which can be printed either on a transparency 
or  on  an  opaque  paper.  The  periods  of  the  two  layer 
patterns, i.e. the space between the axes of parallel lines, 
 
are  close.  We  denote  the  period  of  the  base  layer  as 
bp
. In Figure 1, 
and the period of the revealing layer as 
the period of lines of the base layer is equal to 6 units, and 
the  period  of  lines  of  the  revealing  layer  is  equal  to  5.5 
units.

The  superposition 

image  of  Figure  1  outlines 
periodically  repeating  dark  parallel  bands,  called  moiré 
lines. Spacing between the moiré lines is much larger than 
the periodicity of lines in the layers. 

Light areas of the superposition image correspond to 
the zones where the lines of both layers overlap. The dark 
areas of the superposition image forming the  moiré lines 
correspond to the zones where the lines of the two layers 
interleave,  hiding  the  white  background.  The  labels  of 
Figure  2  show  the  passages  from  light  zones  with 
overlapping  layer  lines  to  dark  zones  with  interleaving 
layer  lines.  The  light  and  dark  zones  are  periodically 
interchanging.

The  superposition  of  two  layers  comprising  parallel 
lines  forms  an  optical  image  comprising  parallel  moiré 
lines  with  a  magnified  period.  According  to  equation 
(2.2), the closer the periods of the two layers, the stronger 
the magnification factor is. 

If the numbers 

p /

 and 

p /

 are integers, then 

if  at  some  moiré  light  zone  the  lines  of  both  layers 
perfectly  overlap,  as  shown  in  Figure  3,  the  layer  lines 
will also perfectly overlap also at the centers of each other 
light  zone.  If

with the centers of layer lines. In any case, equation (2.2)

For the case when the revealing layer period is longer 
than the base layer period, the space between moiré lines 
of  the  superposition  pattern  is  the  absolute  value  of 
formula of (2.2). 

The  thicknesses  of  layer  lines  affect  the  overall 
darkness of the superposition image and the thickness of 
the moiré lines, but the period 
 does not depend on the

layer  lines’  thickness.  In  our  examples  the  base  layer 
lines’ thickness is equal to

Speedup of movements with moiré 

 

The moiré bands of Figure 1 will move if we displace 
the  revealing  layer.  When  the  revealing  layer  moves 
perpendicularly  to  layer  lines,  the  moiré  bands  move 
along  the  same  axis,  but  several  times  faster  than  the 
movement of the revealing layer. 

The three images of Figure 4 show the superposition 
image for different positions of the revealing layer. In the 
second image (b) of Figure 4, compared to the first image 
(a),  the  revealing  layer  is  shifted  up  by  one  third  of  the

.  The  images  show  that  the  moiré  lines  of  the 
superposition image move up at a speed, much faster than 
the speed of movement of the revealing layer.

  for  the  examples  of  Figure  4  correspond  to  the 

distances  between  the  lines  along  the  vertical  axis 
corresponding to the axis of movements. When the layer 
lines  are  horizontal  (or  perpendicular  to  the  movement 
axis) the periods (p) are equal to the distances (denoted as 
T) between the lines (as in Figure 1, Figure 3, and Figure 
4).  If  the  lines  are  inclined  the  periods  (p)  along  the 
vertical axis does not correspond anymore to the distances 
(T)  between  the  lines.  According  to  our  notations,  the 
periods  p  do  not  represent  the  distances  T  between  the 
lines, but the distances between the lines along the axis of 
movements.  By  adopting  the  new  notation,  equations 
(2.2), (2.3), and (2.4) are valid all the time. Equations for 
inclination  angles  for  such  notation  of  periods  (p)  are 
presented  in  this  section.  For  rotational  movements  p 
values represent the periods along circumference, i.e. the 
angular periods. 

2.3.1.  Computing moiré lines’ inclination as 

function of the inclination of layers’ lines 

The  superposition  of  two  layers  with  identically 
inclined  lines  forms  moiré  lines  inclined  at  the  same 
angle. Figure 5 is obtained from Figure 1 with a vertical 
shearing.  In  Figure  5  the  layer  lines  and  the  moiré  lines 
are  inclined  by  10  degrees.  Inclination  is  not  a  rotation. 
During the inclination the distance between the layer lines 
along  the  vertical  axis  (p)  is  conserved,  but  the  true 
distance T between the lines (along an axis perpendicular 
to  these  lines)  changes.  The  diagram  of  Figure  8  shows 
,

  and

The  inclination  degree  of  layer  lines  may  change 
along 
forming  curves.  The 
superposition  of  two  layers  with  identical  inclination 
pattern  forms  moiré  curves  with  the  same  inclination 
pattern.  In  Figure  6  the  inclination  degree  of  layer  lines 
gradually  changes  according  the  following  sequence  of 
degrees (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30), meaning that the curve 
is  divided  along  the  horizontal  axis  into  four  equal 
intervals and in each such interval the curve’s inclination 
degree  linearly  changes  from  one  degree  to  the  next 
according  to  the  sequence  of  five degrees.  Layer periods 
  represent  the  distances  between  the  curves

computed  according  to  equation  (2.4)  signifies  the 
movement in the reverse direction.

Superposition of layers with inclined 
lines 

In this section we develop equations for patterns with 
inclined  lines.  Since  most  of  all  we  are  interested  in 
optical  speedup,  instead  of  using  the  well  known 
equations, we represent the case of inclined patterns such 
that  the  equations  (2.2),  (2.3),  and  (2.4)  remain  valid  in

the  horizontal  axis  into  vertical  bands  and  by  applying  a 
corresponding  vertical  shearing  and  shifting  to  each  of 
these  bands.  Equation  (2.2)  is  valid  for  computing  the 
spacing 
  between  the  moiré  curves  along  the  vertical

axis and equation (2.4) for computing the optical speedup 
ratio  when  the  revealing  layer  moves  along  the  vertical 
axis.

More  interesting  is  the  case  when  the  inclination 
degrees  of  layer  lines  are  not  the  same  for  the  base  and 
revealing  layers.  Figure  7  shows  four  superposition 
images where the inclination degree of base layer lines is 
the same for all images (10 degrees), but the inclination of 
the  revealing  layer  lines  is  different  for  images  (a),  (b), 
(c),  and  (d)  and  is  equal  to  7,  9,  11,  and  13  degrees 
correspondingly.  The  periods  of  layers  along  the vertical

We  provide  a  GIF  animation  of  the  superposition

between 5 and 15 degrees [ps], [gif], [tif]. 

Figure  8  helps  to  compute  the  inclination  degree  of 
moiré optical lines as a function of the inclination of the 
revealing and the base layer lines. We draw the layer lines 
schematically without showing their true thicknesses. The 
bold lines of the diagram inclined by 
bα  degrees are the 
base  layer  lines.  The  bold  lines  inclined  by 
rα   degrees 
are  the  revealing  layer  lines.  The  base  layer  lines  are 
vertically  spaced  by  a  distance  equal  to

lines. The dashed line of Figure 8 corresponds to the axis

  (the  bold  curve)  the 

rotation of moiré lines is linear with respect to the rotation 
of  the  revealing  layer.  Comparisons  of  Figure  10  and

(i.e.  inclination  of  lines)  and  rotation  of  the  revealing

Equation (2.22) shows that relative to the tangent of 
the base layer lines’ angle, the increment of the tangent of 
the  revealing  layer  lines’  angle  needs  to  be  smaller  than 
the increment of the tangent of the moiré lines’ angle, by 
the same factor as the optical speedup. 

For  any  given  base  layer  line  inclination,  equation 
(2.20) permits us to obtain a desired moiré line inclination 
by  properly  choosing  the  revealing  layer  inclination.  In 
Figure  6  we  showed  an  example  where  the  curves  of 
layers  follow  an  identical  inclination  pattern  forming  a 
superposition  image  with  the  same  inclination  pattern. 
The  inclination  degrees  of  the  layers’  and  moiré  lines 
change along the horizontal axis according the following 
sequence  of  alternating  degree  values  (+30,  –30,  +30,  –
30, +30). In Figure 11 we obtained the same superposition 
pattern  as  in  Figure  6,  but  the  base  layer  consists  of 
straight  lines  inclined  by  –10  degrees.  The  revealing 
pattern  of  Figure  11  is  computed  by  interpolating  the 
curves  into  connected  straight  lines,  where  for  each 
position  along  the  horizontal  axis,  the  revealing  line’s 
inclination angle is computed as a function of 
bα  and  mα , 
according  to  equation  (2.20).  Figure  11  demonstrates 
what  is  already  expressed  by  equation  (2.22):  the 
difference  between 
the 
revealing  layer  and  the  base  layer  are  several  times 
smaller  than  the  difference  between  the  inclination 
patterns of moiré lines and the base layer lines.

Another  example  forming  the  same  superposition 
patterns as in Figure 6 and Figure 11 is shown in Figure 
12. Note that in Figure 12 the desired inclination pattern 
(+30, –30,  +30, –30, +30)  is  obtained using  a base  layer 
with an inverted inclination pattern (–30, +30, –30, +30, –
30).

Superposition of circular periodic 
patterns with radial lines 

According  to  equations  (3.1),  equation  (2.2)  can  be 

rewritten as follows: 

 
Figure 12. A superposition image, where the base layer 

and moiré curves are mirrored relatively to the 
horizontal axis [eps], [png] 

We  provide  a  GIF  animation  where  we  show  a 
superposition image with a constant inclination pattern of 
moiré lines (+30, –30, +30, –30, +30) for modifying pairs 
of  base  and  revealing  layers  [ps],  [tif],  [gif].  The  base 
layer  inclination  pattern  gradually  changes  and  the 
revealing layer inclination pattern correspondingly adapts 
such  that  the  superposition  image’s  inclination  pattern 
remains the same.

Superposition of periodic 
circular patterns 

Similarly  to  layer  and  moiré  patterns  comprising 
parallel  lines  (see  Figure  1,  Figure  2,  and  Figure  3), 
concentric  superposition  of  dense  periodic  layer  patterns 
comprising  radial  lines  forms  magnified  periodic  moiré 
patterns also with radial lines. 

Figure  13  is  the  counterpart  of  Figure  1,  where  the 
horizontal  axis  is  replaced  by  the  radius  and  the  vertical 
axis  by  the  angle.  Full  circumferences  of  layer  patterns 
are  equally  divided  by  integer  numbers  of  radial  lines. 
The number of radial lines of the base layer is denoted as 
 and the number of radial lines of the revealing layer is 
bn
denoted as

Radial  lines  in  Figure  13  have  constant  angular

of  radial  lines  affects  the  overall  darkness  of  the 
superposition  image  and  the  width  of  moiré  bands,  but 
there  is  no  impact  on  other  factors,  such  as  period  of

equations  (3.4)  and  (3.3),  the  optical  speedup  is  equal  to 
30, confirmed by the two images (a) and (b) of Figure 14, 
and the number of moiré lines is equal to 6, confirmed by 
the image of Figure 13.

Figure  16  shows  a  superposition  of  layers  with 
curved  radial  lines.  The  inclination  of  curves  of  both 
layers  follows  an  identical  pattern  corresponding  to  the 
following sequence of degrees (+35, –35, +35, –35, +35). 
Layer  curves  are  iteratively  constructed  with  increment 
pairs 
  computed  according  to  equation  (3.6). 
Since the inclination patterns of both layers of Figure 16 
are  identical,  the  moiré  curves  also  follow  the  same 
pattern.

3.2. 

Superposition of circular patterns 
with radial curves 

In circular periodic patterns curved radial lines can be 
constructed  using  the  same  reference  sequences  of 
inclination  degrees  as  used  in  section  2.3  for  curves  of 
Figure 6. The inclination angle at any point of the radial 
curve corresponds to the angle between the curve and the 
axis of the radius passing through the current point. Thus 
inclination  angle  0  corresponds to  straight  radial  lines  as 
shown in Figure 13. With the present notion of inclination 
angles for 
rα , and  mα , equations (2.6) and (2.20) are 

bα , 

applicable for circular patterns without modifications. 

Curves  can  be  constructed  incrementally  with  a 
r∆ . Figure 15 shows a 
constant radial increment equal to 
segment of a curve, marked by a thick line, which has an 
inclination angle equal to α.

background [eps], [png], multi-page [tif], [gif], 
small version [eps], [png] 

Similarly  to  examples  of  Figure  6,  Figure  11,  and 
Figure  12,  where  the  same  moiré  pattern  is  obtained  by 
superposing  different  pairs  of  layer  patterns,  the  circular 
moiré  pattern  of  Figure  16  can  be  analogously  obtained 
by  superposing  other  pairs  of  circular  layer  patterns. 
Taking  into  account  equations  (3.1),  equations  (2.6)  and 
(2.20) can be rewritten as follows:

Thanks to equation (3.8), other pairs of layer patterns

superposition image as in Figure 16. In the first image (a) 
of  Figure  17,  the  base  layer  lines  are  straight.  In  the 
second  image  (b),  the base  layer  lines  inclination  pattern 
is reversed with respect to the moiré lines.

comprise straight radial segments, and in the 
second case the base layer comprise curves 
which are the mirrored counterparts of the 
resulting moiré curves [eps (a)], [png (a)], [eps 
(b)], [png (b)] 

We provide an animation, where the moiré curves of 
the  superposition  image  are  always  the  same,  but  the 
inclination  pattern  of  the  base  layer  curves  gradually 
alternates  between  the  following  two  mirror  patterns 
(+45, –45, +45, –45, +45), and (–45, +45, –45, +45, –45) 
[eps],  [tif],  [gif].  For  each  instance  of  the  animation,  the 
revealing layer lines are computed according to equation 
(3.8)  in  order  to  constantly  maintain  the  same  moiré 
pattern. 

Equations  (3.4)  and  (3.3)  remain  valid  for  patterns 
with curved radial lines. In Figure 16 there are 180 curves 
in  the  revealing  layer  and  171  curves  in  the  base  layer. 
Therefore  optical  speedup  factor  according  to  equation 
(3.4)  is  equal  to  20,  and  the  number  of  moiré  curves 
according  to  equation  (3.3)  is  equal  to  9,  as  seen  in  the 
superposition image of Figure 16. 

4.  Conclusions 

We  redeveloped  the  most  important  formulas  for 
computing  the  periods,  inclination  angles  of  moiré 
patterns, and the velocities of optical shapes. 

Instead  of  using  the  well  known  equations,  we 
represent the case of inclined patterns such that equations 
(2.2),  (2.3),  and  (2.4)  for  linear  patterns  and  their 
counterparts  (3.3),  (3.5),  and  (3.4)  for  circular  patters, 
remain valid in their simple forms. In our equations, the p 
values  represent  the  periods  along  the  axis  of  the 
movement of the revealing layer. 

In  section  2.3.2  we  compared  our  formulas  with  the 

formulas known in the literature.

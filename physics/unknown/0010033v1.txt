Researchers claim to have observed superluminal (faster than light) propagation of

a laser pulse in a gain medium by a new mechanism in which there is no distortion

of the pulse.  Our analysis shows that the observed mechanism is due to pulse

distortion arising from a differential gain effect and should not be viewed as

superluminal propagation.

In a recent article in Nature [1], titled Gain-assisted superluminal light

propagation, experimentalists reported observing a laser pulse propagating faster than the

speed of light through a gas cell which served as a amplifying medium.  They state that

the "peak of the pulse appears to leave the cell before entering it".  This article generated

a great deal of press attention around the world.  For example, reports appeared in CNN

and in newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Washington Post,

South China Morning Post, India Today, and the Guardian of London [2].

The objective of this paper is to analyze, discuss and comment on the conclusions

reached in Ref. 1 and related studies [3].  We show that the theory on which this

superluminal interpretation was based is inaccurate because of an inconsistency in the

ordering of the terms kept in the analysis.  Our analysis of the experiment shows that the

mechanism responsible for the so-called "superluminal propagation" can be attributed to

differential gain of the laser pulse.  That is, the front of the laser pulse is amplified more

than the back, causing the pulse shape to be tilted towards the front.  The leading edge of

the distorted pulse, however, propagates at the speed of light, as one would expect.  The

authors of Ref. 1 specifically discount this explanation.  They claim that superluminal

propagation is observed "while the shape of the pulse is preserved" and "the argument

that the probe pulse is advanced by amplification of its front edge does not apply" in the

present experiment.  Our analysis indicates that these claims are incorrect.

consisting of a specially prepared caesium gas cell of length 

In the experiment a long laser pulse was passed through an amplifying medium
cm, as depicted in
 µsec was much longer (1.1 km) than the gas
cell, so that at any given instant only a small portion of the pulse was inside the cell.  By

Fig. 1.  The laser pulse of duration 

7.3=T

6=L

measuring the pulse amplitude at the exit, they claim that both the front and the back

edges of the pulse were shifted forward in time by the same amount relative to a pulse

that propagated through vacuum.

The following analysis considers a laser pulse propagating in a general dispersive

and amplifying medium characterized by a frequency dependent complex refractive index
(ωn
)

.  To determine the evolution of the pulse envelope we represent the laser electric

field amplitude as

small in the reported experiment and it is therefore legitimate to neglect the reflection of

the laser pulse at the entrance and exit of the gas cell.

The envelope equation describing the evolution of a laser pulse propagating in a

general dispersive medium has been derived elsewhere [4].  For a one-dimensional laser

pulse the envelope equation is given by

(2) is derived by substituting the field representation given by Eq. (1) into the linearized

wave equation and performing a spectral analysis [4,5] that involves expanding the
refractive index about the carrier frequency  oω  and neglecting reflected waves.  These
assumptions are valid when the refractive index is close to unity and the spectral width of
the pulse is narrow.  We limit our analysis to terms of order  2κ , i.e., to lowest order in
group velocity dispersion; this is sufficient for the present purpose.  In a vacuum,

To solve for the pulse envelope in a general dispersive medium we Fourier

than c or negative, there are other instances in which the concept of group velocity does

not represent the pulse velocity.  These include situations where the interaction length, L,

is less than the phase mixing length associated with the spectral components of the pulse,

or when L is much less than the pulse length.  These conditions apply in the experiment

of Ref. 1.

The exact solution, given by Eq. (5), to the approximate envelope equation can

lead to unphysical conclusions since it implies that the pulse propagates undistorted with
<−
velocity  pv  [3].  For example, if 
1
1κc
parameters in Ref. 1, however, 
velocity, 

 is essentially real and < -1, giving a negative pulse
.  They have, as well as others, ascribed physical meaning to this

−=ν

p

/c

310

 in Ref. 1, the

delay time is negative, implying superluminal propagation.  This error is due to retaining

terms beyond the order of the approximation.  That is, the exponential factor in Eq. (4)
contains terms to all orders in 

z2
2νκ
For example, this is equivalent to keeping terms proportional to

To avoid this incorrect conclusion it is necessary to solve Eq. (3) by keeping the

order of approximation consistent.  Expanding the exponential terms in Eq. (3) to second

order gives

In Eq. (7) the first term on the right hand side denotes the vacuum solution, the second

term represents lowest order differential gain, while the third and higher order terms are

5

small and denote higher order effects.  The result in Eq. (7) shows that the pulse
propagates at the speed of light while undergoing differential gain.  The quantity  1κ  can
be negative in the presence of gain or absorption.  In the case of gain, when 
, the

0

1 <κ

front portion of the pulse is amplified more than the back.  Note that the differential gain

effect, i.e., the first order 

t∂∂ /

term in Eq. (7), can be recovered from Eq. (5) through a

Taylor expansion.  However, this is simply equivalent to expanding Eq. (5) so that the

proper order of approximation is recovered, as was done in deriving Eq. (7).

The results of this analysis may be used to interpret the experiment.  The

susceptibility of the medium used in Ref. 1 has the following form near the resonance

The differential gain effect, which is misinterpreted as superluminal propagation,

.  In this case differential absorption occurs in which

the back of the pulse is absorbed more than the front.  This effect has also been presented

as superluminal propagation [7].

The validity of Eq. (7) was verified by numerically solving the envelope equation

to higher order.  Figure 3 compares the solution given by Eq. (7) at the exit of the gain
medium (dotted curves) with the vacuum solution 

 (solid curves).  Panel (a)

shows the entire pulse profile.  Consistent with the experimental measurements, the

leading edge is shifted forward in time relative to the vacuum solution by 62 nsec.  Panel

(b) shows three curves: the solid curve denotes the vacuum solution, the dotted curve

shows the result obtained from Eq. (7), and the dashed curve shows the result obtained

7

from Eq. (5).  The dotted curve shows that the front of the pulse propagates with velocity

c; the propagation is not superluminal.  The unphysical solution, given by the dashed

curve, shows the front of the pulse propagating at superluminal velocities.  Panel (c) is an

expanded view near the peak of the pulse showing that the front is amplified more than

the back.

In conclusion, we find that to properly describe pulse propagation, a consistent

ordering of the approximations is necessary.  In addition, the distortion of the pulse form

that the authors of Ref. 1 misinterpret as a newly observed mechanism for superluminal

propagation is actually due to differential gain.  That is, the modification of the pulse

shape is due to the addition of new photons to the front of the pulse.  This phenomenon

should not be viewed as superluminal light propagation.

obtained from Eq. (7).  Solid curves denote a pulse that has traveled a distance L
through vacuum.  The dashed curve in panel (b) is the unphysical solution
obtained from Eq. (5) showing superluminal propagation.  Panels (b) and (c) are
expanded views of the front and peak of the pulse, respectively.  The parameters
for this figure are the same as in Fig. 2.

Abstract.  A  sensitive  laser  spectroscopic  method  has  been 
applied to the quantitative determination of the isotope ratio of 
helium  at  the  level  of  3He/4He  =  10-7  -  10-5.  The  resonant 
absorption of 1083 nm laser light by the metastable 3He atoms 
the  frequency 
in  a  discharge  cell  was  measured  with 
modulation  saturation  spectroscopy 
the 
abundance  of  4He  was  measured  by  a  direct  absorption 
technique.  The  results  on  three  different  samples  extracted 
from the atmosphere and commercial helium gas were in good 
agreement  with  values  obtained  with  mass  spectrometry.  The 
achieved 3σ detection limit of  3He in helium is 4 × 10-9. This 
demonstration  required  a  200  µL  STP  sample  of  He.  The 
sensitivity  can  be  further  improved,  and  the  required  sample 
size reduced, by several orders of magnitude with the addition 
of cavity enhanced spectroscopy.

The ratio of the stable He isotopes in the Earth’s atmosphere 
(Ratm) is 3He/4He ~ 1.4×10-6 (Mamyrin et al., 1970). This value 
represents a steady-state mixture of He released from the Earth 
into the atmosphere where it has a residence time of only about 
1  million  years before escaping into space (Torgerson, 1989). 
The He isotope ratio in primitive solar system material and in 
the  lunar  soil  is  relatively  high  at  120-330  Ratm  (Pepin  and 
Porcelli,  2002).  Helium  in  mantle-derived  volcanic  rocks  and 
emitted from volcanic fumaroles has a He isotope ratio about 8 
Ratm (Craig et al., 1978), whereas radiogenic He in continental 
rocks  has  a  He  isotope  ratio  about  0.01  Ratm  (Morrison  and 
Pine, 1955; Mamyrin and Tolstikhin, 1984). Thus, the range in 
He isotope ratios of natural materials is about 0.01 to 330 Ratm, 
or 3He/4He = 10-8 to 5×10-4. Measurements of He isotope ratios 
have  a  number  of  important  geoscientific  applications.    For 
example,  they  are  used  to  trace  volatile  emanations  from  the 
Earth’s  mantle,  such  as  those  occurring  in  volcanic  areas

young  groundwaters  via  the  3H-3He  method  (Schlosser  et  al., 
1998);  to  determine  the  cosmic  ray  exposure  ages  of  surface 
rocks  (Kurz,  1986);  and  to  prospect  the  lunar  surface  for  3He

through 

A  typical  measurement  of  the  He  isotope  ratio  in  natural 
materials  requires  extraction  and  purification  of  the  He, 
followed by introduction of about 5 nL of He into a specially 
designed magnetic sector mass spectrometer. Approximately 1 
× 107  3He atoms are required to obtain a precise measurement 
of  the  3He/4He  ratio  (Clarke  et  al.,  1976).  Alternatively, 
Kudryavtsev  et  al.  (1989)  explored  a  collinear  resonance 
ionization  method  and  performed  measurements  of  3He/4He 
ratios  down  to the 10-8 level. However, their setup was rather 
complex. 
lasers  at  different 
wavelengths and a large atomic beam system. The purpose of 
this  communication  is  to  demonstrate  a  new  spectroscopic 
method  for  the  measurement  of  He  isotope  ratios.  Since  the 
spectroscopic 
(more 
compact),  lighter,  and  less  expensive  to  purchase  and  operate 
than  a conventional noble gas mass spectrometer, it would be 
ideal  to  use  in  field  studies  related  to  earthquake  prediction 
(Sano et al., 1998), volcanic hydrothermal systems (Sturchio et 
al.,  1993)  and  chemical  oceanography  (Lupton  and  Craig, 
1981).

In this work we use a laser spectroscopic technique and take 
advantage  of  the  isotope  shift  between  3He  and  4He  to 
separately  probe 
laser 
excitation  of  ground-level  helium  atoms  is  at  present  only 
realized with pulsed and sophisticated vacuum-ultraviolet laser 
systems.  Instead,  we  choose  to  excite  the  metastable  helium 
atoms via the 23S → 23P transition for the resonant absorption 
measurements  because  it  has  a  reasonable  transition  strength 
and  is  accessible  with  commercially  available  lasers  at  1083 
nm  (Zhao  et  al.,  1991).  The  resonant  absorption  peaks  of  the 
two isotopes are 65 GHz apart, well separated compared to the 
Doppler width of 2 GHz and the natural linewidth of 1.6 MHz 
(Fig. 1). The resonant absorption signal of the rare isotope 3He, 
S3,  is  measured  using  frequency-modulation  (FM)  saturation 
spectroscopy. This method was first demonstrated by Bjoklund 
(1980)  and  Hall  et  al.  (1981).  The  variations  of  this  method 
have  previously  been  used  to  detect  molecular  species  at  the 
parts-per-million  level  (e.g.  Wang  et  al.,  1995,  Petrov  et  al., 
1997, and Modungno et al., 1998), but to our knowledge it has 
not  been  used  to  detect  rare  isotopes  at  the  comparable  or 
lower  level.  The  resonant  absorption  signal  of  the  abundant 
4He,  S4,  is  measured  simply  with  a  single  laser  beam.  In  this 
work we show that the signal ratio of these two measurements, 
S3/S4,  is  indeed  proportional  to  the  isotope  ratio,  3He/4He. 
Once  the  signal  ratio  is  calibrated  with  a  standard  sample  of 
known  isotope  ratio,  measurements  on  unknown  samples  can 
then be used to determine the unknown isotope ratios. 

The  laser  spectroscopic  measurements  are  performed  at 
Argonne  National  Laboratory  on  three  different  samples  in 
which  the  isotopic  abundance  of  3He  is  also  measured  at  the 
University  of  Tokyo  with 
the  well-established  mass 
spectrometry  method.  Sample  #1  is  extracted  from  the

surrounding air in the laboratory with a sorption pump cooled 
down to 80 K by liquid nitrogen, which effectively absorbs all 
major  gases  in  air  except  neon,  helium  and  hydrogen,  whose 
partial  pressures  in  air  are  13.8  mTorr,  4.0  mTorr  and  0.4 
mTorr,  respectively.  After  the  sorption  pump  has  reached 
equilibrium the remaining gas is compressed with a turbopump 
into an evacuated cell for laser spectroscopy work. In the cell, 
the  chemically  active  gases  such  as  hydrogen  and  water  are 
absorbed  by  a  getter  pump,  and  their  partial  pressures  are 
reduced to less than 1% of the total pressure, leaving only neon 
and  helium  with  the  pressure  ratio  of  approximately  3.5:1  as 
measured  with  a  residual  gas  analyzer.  The  gas  purity  of  the 
sample proves to be critical as any impurities except neon can 
quench the metastable state of helium upon collisions. Sample 
#2 is a commercial helium gas (99.995% pure, AGA UN1046) 
extracted  from  natural  gas.  Sample  #3  is  a  relatively  3He-
enriched  helium  produced  earlier  by  a  collaboration  of  four 
noble gas laboratories in Japan (Matsuda et al., 2002). 

The  gas  sample  is  contained  in  a  1  m  long  and  2.5  cm 
diameter  glass  cell,  around  which  a  RF-driven  discharge  is 
used  to  populate  the  metastable  1s2s  3S1  level  via  electron-
impact  collisions.  Tests  show  that  the  amplitude  of  the  3He 
signal varies by a factor of two in the pressure range of 50-400 
mTorr.  For  an  optimum  3He  signal  the  pressure  should  be 
approximately  200  mTorr,  at  which  an  estimated  metastable 
population  of  approximately  1  ×  10-4  relative  to  groundlevel 
helium atoms is maintained. The minimum sample size needed 
to  fill  this  cell  to  the  operation  pressure  is  200  μL  STP. 
Although  the  sample  size  can  be  decreased  by  one  order  of 
magnitude with a better design of the vacuum system, it is still 
much  larger  than  that  required  by  analyses  with  mass 
spectrometry.  A  laser  system  consisting  of  two  grating 
stabilized  diode-lasers  and  a  fiber  amplifier  provides  the 
required  laser  power  of  500  mW  and  the  single-mode  laser 
frequency  with  long-term  stability  and  scan  control  of  better 
than 1 MHz. 

The setup of FM saturation spectroscopy of 3He is shown in 
Figure  2.  This  approach  is  described  in  detail  in  Hall  et  al. 
(1981).  The  probe  laser  beam  is  phase-modulated  at  36  MHz 
with  an  electro-optical  modulator,  then  sent  through  the  glass 
cell that contains the gas sample with a power of 8 mW and a 
diameter  of  1  cm,  and  finally  focused  onto  a  fast  InGaAs-
photodiode detector. The pump beam is frequency shifted by 2 
MHz  and  chopped  at  45  kHz  with  two  acousto-optical 
modulators,  then  sent  through  the  long  cell  in  the  opposite 
direction with a power of 50 mW and a diameter of 1 cm. The 
signal  from  the  photodiode  is  first  demodulated  at  36  MHz 
with a RF frequency mixer and then at 45 kHz with a lock-in 
amplifier,  whose  output  is  recorded  as  data.  When  the  laser 
frequency  is  scanned  over  the  resonance,  a  signal  with  the 
shape  of  the  derivative  of  a  Lorentzian  is  observed  (Fig.  3). 
Details of the line shape calculation can be found in Supplee et 
al. (1994). For natural samples with the  3He/4He ratio ranging 
from  0.01  Ratm  to  330  Ratm,  the  corresponding  resonant 
absorption  in  this  setup  can  be  set  to  a  range  from  1×10-6  to 
3×10-2,  over  which  the  signal  size  is  expected  to  be  linearly 
proportional to the number of metastable 3He atoms resonantly 
interacting with the laser beams.

is  affected  by 

The  absorption  signal,  however, 

the 
metastable  fraction  which  depends on discharge intensity, gas 
pressure, and the chemical composition of the sample. In order 
to reduce the potential systematic errors due to the changes in 
the metastable fraction, the abundance of the metastable 4He is 
measured for normalization. The abundance of metastable  4He 
is  determined  in  a  single  laser  beam  absorption measurement. 
Using  the  same  setup,  the  level  of  absorption  of  the  probe 
beam is measured directly at the DC-output of the photodiode 
without  any  modulation  techniques.  If  the  laser  frequency  is 
tuned to the resonance of the 23S1 → 23P0 transition of 4He, the 
probe beam is totally absorbed within the Doppler width of 2 
GHz.  Instead,  the  laser  frequency  is  tuned  to  1.5  GHz  away 
from  resonance  and  the  discharge  intensity  is  adjusted  by 
controlling the RF power in order to achieve a condition where 
the  fractional  absorption  is  50%.  The  discharge  intensity  is 
preserved  between  the  4He  and  3He  measurements  so  that  the 
3He  measurement  is  effectively  normalized  by  the  4He 
measurement. 

We  find  the  following  techniques  effective  in  reducing 
detection noise: the probe beam is focused and passed through 
a  50  µm  pinhole  to  eliminate  the  scattering  light  from  the 
pump beam; a 60 dB optical isolator is installed in front of the 
fiber amplifier output to reduce optical feedback caused by the 
reflection  from  the  front  facet  of  the  photodetector;  a  slowly 
drifting interference effect between the pump and probe beam 
is minimized by shifting the pump beam frequency by 2 MHz 
and by slightly misaligning the two beam paths. The achieved 
detection  noise  is  approximately  5  times  the  shot  noise  limit. 
At present, the dominant noise is due to the fluctuation in the 
power of both the diode laser and the fiber amplifier caused by 
the  pickup  of  the  intense  RF  power  needed  to  drive  the 
discharge.  More  thorough  and  effective  RF  shielding  should 
help mitigate this problem. 

Figure  3  shows  a  typical  scan  over  the  3He  resonance.  The 
total scan range is 320 MHz and the scan is accumulated over 
28 minutes. The stronger peak is due to the 23S1,  F=3/2 → 23P2, 
F=5/2 transition and the weaker peak, 221 MHz away, is due to 
the 23S1, F=1/2 → 23P2, F=3/2 transition. The signal-to-noise ratio is 
200 with sample #2 whose isotope ratio (3He/4He) is 2.8 × 10-7. 
The  corresponding  3σ  detection  limit  is  then  4  ×  10-9.  Our 
the  mass 
measurements  are 
spectrometry  values  as  shown  in  Table  1  and  Figure  4.  The 
uncertainties  of  our  measurements  are  dominated  by  system 
instability caused by the change of discharge condition and the 
laser  power  drift  between  the  measurements  on  3He  and  4He. 
These  effects  can  be  reduced  by  a  better  controlled  and  more 
stable  system  and  by  implementing  a  more  frequent  switch 
between the measurements on 3He and 4He. 

in  good  agreement  with 

In  conclusion,  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  isotopic 
abundance  of  3He  in  natural  He  samples  can  be  determined 
quantitatively with a laser absorption technique. The achieved 
3σ  detection  limit  on  the  3He/4He  isotope  ratio  is  4×10-9  with 
the  present  system  containing  a  200  μL  STP  helium  sample. 
We believe that the sensitivity of this method can be improved 
and the sample size decreased by several orders of magnitude. 
Near-term  improvements  such  as  a  more  thorough  RF 
shielding can reduce the detection noise by a factor of 5, down

to the shot noise limit. Furthermore, the cell can be installed in 
a  multi-pass  Fabry-Perot  cavity  to  increase  the  effective 
absorption length by as much as a factor of 1 × 105 (Ma et al., 
1999). In the distant future, when continuous-wave and narrow 
bandwidth  lasers  at  58  nm  may  become  available,  laser 
spectroscopy  would  then  be  performed  on  groundlevel  He 
atoms  rather  than  metastable  He  atoms,  and  the  detection 
sensitivity would be further improved.

Fig. 3. FM spectroscopy signal of 3He. The stronger peak is 
due to the 23S1, F=3/2 → 23P2, F=5/2 transition and the weaker 
peak, 221 MHz away, is due to the 23S1, F=1/2  → 23P2, F=3/2 
transition.

Abstract 
 
Controlled  etching  of  copper  electrodes  in  Gas  Electron  Multiplier  foils 
allows a reduction of the material budget by more than a factor of two for a 
triple-GEM  detector.    Detectors  making  use  of  thinned  foils  provide 
performances similar to those obtained with standard devices: a gain above 
104 for a double-GEM, with energy resolution of 27 % fwhm for 5.9 keV X-
rays.

Readout systems for Time Projection Chambers (TPC) based on wire 
chambers, as well as tracking drift chambers used in current experiments or 
planned  at  high  luminosity  electron-positron  colliders  suffer  from  limited 
rate capability. The high occupancy in systems having large size resolution 
elements (close to a cm in most devices) limits the track finding capability 
and degrades momentum resolution.  

Detectors based on the Gas Electron Multipliers (GEM)[1] can offer a 
solution, and allow overcoming the problem of limited rate capability and of 
high  occupancy.  Using  several  cascaded  GEMs  [2]  permits  to  share  the 
avalanche amplification between the stages, thus minimizing the probability 
of discharge [3, 4].  

A  medium-size  system  of  GEM  detectors,  constructed  for  the  high 
rate COMPASS experiment at CERN, is in operation since 2002 [5]; GEM 
detectors  have  also  been  adopted  for  the  LHCb  muon  trigger    [6],  for  the

TOTEM experiment at CERN [7], and for PHENIX at BNL [8]. In each of 
these projects, sets of triple-GEM detectors cover a total active area of more 
than 1 square meter.  

The amount of material in a tracking system is an important issue, as 
it can degrade the momentum resolution due to multiple Coulomb scattering, 
especially  for  low  momentum  particles.  In  a  triple-GEM  detector,  such  as 
those built for COMPASS, the total material thicknesses is about 3.4x10-3 of 
a radiation length. To this, the copper layers of the standard GEM and drift 
electrodes  (7  times  5  µm)  contribute  to  about  70%.    This  is  slightly  more 
than    for  a  300  µm  thick  silicon  microstrip  detector  (~3.2x10-3  X0). 
However,  in  the  case  of  GEM-based  detector  there  is  a  possibility  to 
substantially decrease the amount of material  reducing the thickness of the 
copper layers; going from 5 to 1 µm, the total radiation length is reduced to 
1.5x10-3, about one half of a solid state device.  More savings in the material 
budget could be achieved using a  double-GEM assembly and  a gas mixture 
based on light noble gases like Ne or He.  

In this note we demonstrate the possibility to manufacture GEM foils 
with thin copper layer, and show that the main operational characteristics of 
a thin-GEM based detector, such as gain and energy resolution, do not differ 
from those of standard devices.  

 To  manufacture  foils  with  thin  copper  layers  we  started  with 
standard,  5  µm  Cu-coated  GEMs;  after  cleaning  and  removal  of  the  
protective  copper  chromate  layer  with  HCl,  the  foils  were  dipped  in 
ammonium  persulfate  to  do  a  micro-etch.  During  the  process,  the  total 
thickness was monitored with a micrometer. When the desired thickness was 
reached,  the  foils  were  removed  from  the  etching  bath,  washed  and  
processed with chromic acid to form again the protective chromate layer.      
The uniformity of thickness of the etched copper layer was measured 
on  a  sample  foil  5x30  cm  in  size,  undergoing  the  same  etching  procedure; 
along  the  30  cm  side  the  copper  layer  was  found  to  have  an  average 
thickness of 1 µm, with about 10% uniformity.   

Examples  of  Scanning  Electron  Microscope  images  of  the  holes  for 
regular and etched foils are shown in Fig. 1; in the etched GEM, the copper 
layer is also removed around the hole by about four µm. A possible benefit 
of this geometry is to prevent the presence of sharp metal edges around the 
rim of the holes, with a consequent better protection against discharges. 

For  the  experimental  verification  of  performances,  the  copper 
electrodes of standard GEM foils, with 10x10 cm2 active area, were reduced 
to 1 µm as described and assembled in a double-GEM detector with 2 mm 

transfer gaps; a drift electrode of aluminized mylar was added 3 mm above 
the  first  GEM.  The  detector  was  irradiated  with  an  X-ray  tube  with  Mo 
anode  operating  at  12  kV,  or  with  an  Fe55  source.  Proper  choice  of  the 
applied  potentials  permitted  to  measure  the  performances  of  the  detector 
both in the single and a double-GEM configuration.  Equal value resistors (5 
MW
) were used in the chain for powering the detector, so that all gaps and 
GEM foils  were fed with the same potential difference. As filling gas, we 
used a 70-30 mixture of argon and CO2. 
            The  results  of  the  gain  measurements  for  thin  single-  and  double-
GEM assemblies are shown in Fig. 2; error bars include fluctuations due to 
temperature and pressure variations. For comparison, results obtained with a 
standard  double-GEM are also plotted in the figure (from Ref. 4):  it can be 
seen that the gain performances are substantially identical. The pulse height 
spectrum for 5.9 keV X-rays from Fe55 source is shown in Fig. 3. 
             The  presence  of  insulating  rims  around  the  light  GEM  holes 
suggests  that  these  foils  might  show  a  larger  gain  instability  than  regular 
GEM. The gain stability after application of high voltage was measured with 
a single GEM detector, using either standard or light foils, and recording the 
anode  current  under  irradiation.  During  the  measurement  the  detector  was 
kept continuously under voltage, but exposed to irradiation only for a short 
periods  (several  seconds)  needed  measure  the  gain.  The  results  of  the 
comparison  are  shown in  Fig.4; for  each GEM  type two  sets  of  curves  are 
shown  for  different  induction  fields.  Error  bars  represent  systematic 
variations due  of  ambient pressure  and temperature,  as  well  as  fluctuations 
of the current readings due to pick-up noise. In all cases the gain shows an 
initial  increase  during  the  first  hours  of  operation;  this  increase  is  more 
pronounced    for  lower  induction  field  and  is  about  20%  for  the  induction 
field  of  2.5kV  for  both  regular  and  light  GEMs  This  is  compatible  with 
previous observations [9].  
This is the first demonstration that GEM foils with thin copper layer 
 
can  be  easily  produced  and  shows  performances  similar  to  the  standard, 
thicker foils. The feasibility of the mechanical design of low-mass detectors, 
using thin foils and including self-supporting cylindrical GEM structures is 
also under investigation at CERN and at BINP.  

 
We are very thankful to Junji Haba for initiating the discussion about 

possible use of light GEMs in the BELLE tracking system.

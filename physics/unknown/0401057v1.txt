Abstract

Picosecond  dynamics  of  hydrated  electrons  and  hydroxyl  radicals  generated  in

200  nm  photodissociation  of  aqueous  hydroxide  and  400  nm  (3-photon)  ionization  of

water  in  concentrated  alkaline  solutions  were  obtained.  No  deprotonation  of  hydroxyl

radicals  was  observed  on  sub-nanosecond  time  scale,  even  in  1-10  M  KOH  solutions.

This result is completely at odds with the kinetic data for deprotonation of OH radical in

dilute alkaline solutions. We suggest that the deprotonation of hydroxyl radical is slowed

down dramatically in concentrated alkaline solutions.

1. Introduction

In recent years, there has been renewed interest in theoretical and experimental

studies of the dynamics of electron detachment from simple inorganic anions in liquids,

such as halides in water (e.g., [1]) and sodide in THF (e.g., [2]). One of the less studied of

these photoreactions is the dissociation of aqueous hydroxide. This photoreaction yields a

with a quantum efficiency of 0.11 [3,4]. This geminate pair is of fundamental importance

for the radiation- and photo- chemistry of water, because the same species, OH and  eaq

accounts for 80% of geminate electron decay (the remaining 20% of the photoelectrons

reactions of hydrated electrons, in alkaline solutions its rate is comparable to that of the

(The pKa of the hydroxyl radical at 25 oC is 11.54 to 12.1 [8-11]). Most estimates for the
rate constant of forward rxn. (3) cluster around (1.2-1.3)x1010 M-1 s-1 (e.g., [12]), though
Hickel, Cortfizen, and Sehested [13] gave (6.3±1.3)x109 M-1 s-1 for the forward and 106 s-
1 for the backward reaction (previous estimates for the latter were as high as (9.2-9.6)x107
s-1 [12,14]). All of these kinetic data were obtained in dilute alkaline solutions.

Rxn.  (3)  plays  the  central  role  in  the  radiation  chemistry  of  strongly  alkaline

solutions, such as high-level radioactive waste stored within the US-DOE complex. Note

photoexcitation of hydroxide, and rxn. (4), by 3-photon 400 nm ionization of water in

these  alkaline  solutions.  In  1-10  M  KOH  solutions,  a  change  in  the  recombination

dynamics of the electron due to the occurrence of rapid (forward) rxn. (3) was expected.

Contrary to these expectations, Crowell et al. [16] observed no concentration dependence

for 1-10 M hydroxide. This result is doubly surprising, because in addition to rapid rxn.
(3) converting OH to O-,  it is known from other studies [17] that the survival probability

of geminate pairs generated by electron photodetachment from aqueous anions rapidly

decreases  with  the  ionic  strength  of  the  solution.  This  effect  is  thought  to  originate

through  the  cation  association  with  the  electron  and  its  anion  precursor  [17].  For

hydroxide anion photoexcited at 193 nm, ca. 6% decrease in the free electron yield per 1

M ionic strength (changed by addition of NaClO4) has been observed by Sauer et al. [17]

Yet the addition of 1-10 M of KOH [16] and 1-9 M NaClO4 [17] had negligible effect on

the  electron  dynamics  within  the  first  600  ps  after  the  photoexcitation  pulse.  Cation

A possible rationale for our failure to observe the OH deprotonation indirectly,

through its effect on the electron dynamics, would be that these dynamics are not too
sensitive  to  the  replacement  of  OH  by  O-.  Indeed,  it  is  known  that  in  dilute  alkaline

solutions, the rate constants of the bulk reaction

and rxn. (2) are fairly similar, and these two constants may become even more similar in
the  presence  of  atmospheric  ions  screening  the  repulsive  Coulomb  potential  of  the  O-

anion.  Below,  it  is  demonstrated  that  this  rationale  does  not  account  for  our  kinetic

observations, because the anticipated disappearance of OH by rxn. (3) was not observed

even when the OH radical, rather than its geminate partner, was detected.

2. Experimental.

The  kinetic  measurements  reported  below  were  obtained  using  a  1  kHz

Ti:sapphire  chirped  pulse  amplification  setup  (see  refs.  [19]  for  more  detail)  which

yielded Gaussian, 60 fs FWHM, 3 mJ pulses of 800 nm light. These pulses were used to

generate 400 nm (second harmonic) or 200 nm (fourth harmonic) pump pulses. Up to 20
µJ of the 200 nm light (300-350 fs FWHM pulse) and 200 µJ of 400 nm light (150-200 fs

FWHM  pulse)  was  produced  by  harmonic  generation.  The  800  nm  and  266  nm  (third
harmonic) probe pulses were derived from the same beam. See refs. [16] and [19] for
more detail. The pump and probe beams were perpendicularly polarized and focused to
round spots of 60-150 µm and 20-30 µm in radius, respectively. The maximum fluences
of the 200 nm and 400 nm photons were 0.025 and 0.4 J/cm2, respectively. The vertical

bars shown in the kinetics (Fig. 2) represent 95% confidence limits for each data point.

Typically, 150-200 points acquired on a quasi-logarithmic grid out to 600 ps were used to

obtain these kinetics. A short-lived "spike" was observed within the duration of 200 nm

or 400 nm pump pulse, which is due to simultaneous absorption of this pump pulse and

266 nm probe pulse (i. e., "1+1" nonlinear absorbance) [20]. This "spike" is not shown in

the  kinetic  plots  given  below.  In  very  concentrated  alkali  solutions,  fewer  200  nm

photons are available for this "1+1" process due to the increased sample absorption, and

the "spike" is less prominent.

Hydroxide  solutions  of  low  concentration  were  prepared  by  mixing  1  M  KOH

volumetric  standard  (Aldrich)  with  deaerated  nanopure  water;  concentrated  alkaline

solutions were prepared by dissolving solid KOH pellets (Aldrich, highest purity) in this
standard solution. The laser beams were crossed at 6.5o at the surface of a 150 µm thick

jet. To prevent the absorption of CO2 from the air, this high speed jet was enclosed in a

box that was constantly purged with dry N2. An all 316 stainless steel and Teflon flow

system was used to pump the solution through the jet.

3. 266 nm absorptivity of OH, O-, and eaq

Both  eaq

−   and  OH  absorb  at  266  nm,  but  the  molar  absorptivities  for  these  two

species in the UV are not known accurately. For the OH radical, the overall shape of the

absorption  band  is  known  [21-26],  but  the  estimates  for  the  absolute  extinction
-,  the  wavelength  of  266  nm  corresponds  to  a  narrow
coefficient  vary  by  30%.  For  eaq
intervalley between the 1s → CB absorption band in the VIS and near UV and a strong

bound-to-bound transition at 180 nm that involves O 2p orbitals of water molecules [23].

Different absorption spectra and estimates for the absorption coefficient have been given

for this region in the literature [23,25]. Perhaps, the most consistent estimates were given
by Boyle et al. [23] (who used UV flash photolysis of water): ε266(OH)=370 M-1 cm-1 and
ε266(eaq
-) =720 M-1 cm-1 and by Nielsen et al. [25] (who used pulse radiolysis of neutral
aqueous solutions): ε266(OH)=420 M-1 cm-1 and ε266(eaq

-)=600 M-1 cm-1. In concentrated

salt solutions (including alkaline solutions), the vis band of the hydrated electron shifts to

the blue [17,27,28]; the amount of this effect on the UV absorbance of the electron is not

known.

The spectrum of O- is known [24,29], as this species can be generated by pulse
radiolysis of N2O-saturated alkaline solutions. Above 300 nm, the UV spectra of O- (in 1

M NaOH) and OH (in pH=7 solution) are nearly identical. Below 300 nm, the absorbance

of the OH radical passes through a maximum at 230 nm (see Fig. 3 in ref. [24]) whereas
the  spectrum  of  O-  slowly  increases  towards  the  UV.  While  the  exact  shape  of  the
spectrum  at λ<220 nm (where hydroxide absorbs strongly) was not reproducible, both
groups that studied the O- spectrum obtained ε266(O-)=220 M-1 cm-1 (vs. 460 M-1 cm-1 for

5

OH) [24]. In fact, 266 nm is the most convenient wavelength to observe the progress of
rxn. (3) spectroscopically since the ratio of the extinction coefficients of the OH and O-

radicals reaches a maximum of ca. 2.1 at this wavelength.

Using the estimates given above, it is easy to demonstrate that the conversion of

266 nm by at least 23%. Such a change would be readily observable in the kinetic traces,
provided that rxn. (3) occurred on the expected time scale. That condition requires [OH-]

> 1 M. Note that backward rxn. (3) is negligible on our time scale.

4. Results.

a. 200 nm pump - 266 nm probe kinetics.

Fig. 1 shows 200 nm pump - 266 nm probe kinetics obtained in 0.1, 1, 3, 5, and

10 M solution of KOH. The absorbance signal scaled linearly with the pump power; 2-
photon excitation of water by 200 nm light was negligible due to high absorptivity of OH-
at 200 nm (ε200(OH-)=1000 M-1 cm-1). To facilitate the comparison, the kinetics shown in

Fig. 1 were normalized at 10 ps. As can be seen from this plot, all of these normalized

266  nm  kinetics  are  the  same;  furthermore,  these  kinetics  are  identical  to  the  800  nm

kinetics obtained for the same photosystem [16]. Only the hydrated electron absorbs at

the latter wavelength. The anticipated loss of the 266 nm absorbance due to rapid forward

rxn. (3) was not observed.

Confronted with this result, two control experiments were carried out in order to

establish (i) whether the OH radicals can be observed using our setup and (ii) whether the

rapid  deprotonation  of  these  OH  radicals  in  other  photosystems  can  be  observed.

Answering  the  second  question  is  important  because  it  has  not  been  fully  established
whether  rxn.  (1)  is  the  only  reaction  of  photoexcited  OH-.  In  particular,  rapid

deprotonation of a vibrationally hot OH radical can occur in concert with the electron
detachment, yielding the O- radical directly:

In  such  a  case,  the  expected  transformation  of  OH  to  O-  via  rxn.  (3)  would  not  occur

because no OH radicals are present in the photolysate in the first place. We remind the

reader that a concerted proton and electron transfer (written as rxn. (1)) similar to rxn. (7)

is considered as the most likely mechanism for low-energy ionization of liquid water (see

ref. [5] and references therein). Conceivably, a similar photoprocess might have occurred
in the laser excitation of OH-.

To  answer  the  first  question,  we  studied  200  nm  photodissociation  of  aqueous

hydrogen peroxide [19]. Transient absorption kinetics of the OH radicals at 266 nm were

observed  in  photolysis  of  1  M  H2O2  (see  ref.  [19]  for  more  detail).  The  OH  radicals

rapidly escaped from the solvent cage into the bulk with a time constant of 30 ps. Using

the  estimates  for  OH  absorptivity  given  in  section  3,  the  quantum  yield  of  peroxide

decomposition at 500 ps was 0.44 [19] vs. 0.49±0.07 [30] or 0.47±0.03 [31] at 254 nm

and 0.45±0.06 at 222 nm [32] obtained by others. In addition to showing that OH radicals

can be observed using our setup, the molar absorptivity estimates given in section 3 were

reaffirmed in this control experiment.

Unfortunately,  200  nm  photodissociation  of  H2O2  cannot  be  used  to  answer

whether it is possible to directly observe the OH deprotonation on the fast time scale. To

observe  rxn.  (3)  within  the  first  600  ps  (which  is  the  time  window  of  our  study),  the
concentration of OH- must be high, whereas pKa for H2O2 and OH are similar, 11.7 and

11.8,  respectively  [15].  Consequently,  H2O2  is  fully  deprotonated  in  the  alkaline
-  yields  OH  and  O-  radicals.  The  resulting  OH

way to observe the deprotonation is to have large excess of OH- with respect to HO2

However, in such a case, most of the 200 nm photons would be absorbed by hydroxide as

it  has  5  times  higher  absorbance  at  200  nm  than  HO2

-  [23,24].  Furthermore,  HO2

thermodynamically unstable and rapidly dissociates in a high-speed jet. Consequently, a

different strategy was used to generate OH radicals in the strongly alkaline solutions.

7

b. 400 nm photon pump - 266 nm probe kinetics.

For  400  nm  light,  2-photon  absorptivity  of  1  M  hydroxide  is  4  cm/TW  vs.  3-
photon absorptivity of 270 cm2/TW3  for  neat  water  [16].  Therefore,  when  the  400  nm
irradiance  exceeds  0.1-2  TW/cm2,  most  of  the  electrons  generated  in  the  400  nm

photoexcitation  of  1  M  KOH  solution  originate  through  3-photon  ionization  of  water.
This photoionization yields H3O+ ions (neutralized in 10 ps via rxn. (5)) and hydroxyl

radical.  By  comparing  800  nm  (electron)  and  266  nm  (electron  +  hydroxyl)  kinetics

obtained  under  identical  excitation  conditions  it  is  possible  to  deduce  whether  the

expected extra loss of the 266 nm absorbance due to ongoing forward rxn. (3) occurs.

Fig.  2  demonstrates  a  comparison  between  the  266  nm  and  800  nm  kinetics

obtained by 400 nm excitation of 1 M KOH. Since the solution is relatively transparent to

the 400 nm light, a weak second "spike" (<3% of the prompt "spike") was observed due

to "1+1" nonlinear absorbance that involved the pump pulse reflected by the back surface

of  the  jet.  This  second  "spike"  is  not  shown  in  the  plot.  The  transient  kinetics  were

normalized  at  5-10  ps,  at  which  time  this  nonlinear  absorbance  becomes  negligible.

Under the excitation conditions of Fig. 2, ca. 75% of the electrons were formed via 3-

photon  ionization  of  water.  At  the  higher  pump  power,  the  266  nm  kinetics  become

noisier, due to thermal lensing in the jet. It appears that within the confidence limits of

our  kinetic  measurement,  the  two  kinetic  traces  at  266  and  800  nm  are  identical.  No

deprotonation of the OH radical was observed. Thus, postulating rxn (7) to account for

our  observations  for  hydroxide  served  no  purpose.  Advocating  the  use  of  the  Occam

principle, we thereby conclude that rxn. (1) rather than rxn. (7) is the main dissociative
path for one-photon excitation of OH-.

5. Discussion.

To  summarize,  the  expected  consequences  of  rxn.  (3)  were  not  observed  in

strongly  alkaline  solutions  on  the  sub-nanosecond  time  scale,  neither  in  electron

photodetachment from hydroxide (section 4.a) nor in water photoionization (section 4.b).

8

Our failure to observe rxn. (3) directly, at 266 nm, or indirectly, at 800 nm, leaves only

two possible interpretations:

The  first  is  that  rxn.  (3)  is  at  least  10  times  slower  than  estimated  from  the

extrapolation  of  kinetic  data  obtained  from  dilute  alkaline  solutions  (see  the

Introduction). The second is that the extinction coefficients given in the literature for the
-, these coefficients and

species involved (section 3) are grossly incorrect. For OH and eaq

the  UV  spectra  have  been  measured  at  neutral  pH, whereas our kinetic measurements

were  carried  out  in  1-10  M  alkaline  solutions.  If  the  UV  spectrum  for  the  OH  radical

exhibits a concentration dependent band shift, that may render the difference between the
(

pump-probe experiments. Furthermore, if the blue shift of the electron spectrum in the

alkaline solutions is extended to the UV, the molar absorptivity of the electron at 266 nm

may increase, and that decreases the relative reduction in the 266 nm absorbance when

(

 pair via rxn. (3).

We believe that the second rationale is less likely. The 230 nm band of OH radical

originates through an intramolecular transition in this radical; it is unlikely that this band

demonstrates  significant  ionic  strength  dependence.  The  blue  shift  in  the  absorption
spectrum of O- is likely (see below), but this shift would only increase the reduction in

the 266 nm absorbance. The electron spectrum might shift to the blue in the UV, but the

expected shift (judged from the vis band shift) is ca. 1 nm per 1 M ionic strength [17,35],

and the absorption spectrum around 266 nm is flat. Our sensitivity was such that even a

5-10% reduction in the 266 nm absorbance due to rxn. (3) would have been observed at

least  on  some  time  scale,  and  it  seems  very  unlikely  that  an  increase  in  the  266  nm

absorbance of the electron due to the band shift can account for our observations.

Thus, by exclusion of other options, we conclude that the rate of forward rxn. (3)

is dramatically reduced in concentrated (1-10 M) alkaline solutions. To the best of our

knowledge, such a claim is neither supported nor contradicted by the existing body of

pulse radiolysis and flash photolysis studies of such solutions.

9

The  cause  for  the  retardation  of  OH  deprotonation  in  concentrated  alkali  is

currently unclear. Many aqueous anions, such as halides and pseudohalides, exhibit the

so-called CTTS (charge transfer to solvent) bands in their UV spectra; the red "tail" of the
O- spectrum strikingly resembles those CTTS bands. It is known that these CTTS bands

shift to the blue due to the constriction of the solvation cage around the anion [27]; it is
likely that such a constriction also occurs for OH- and O-, changing the energetics of rxn.

(3). Furthermore, slowing down of forward rxn. (3) may be the trivial consequence of an

increase in the solution viscosity, from 1 cP in water to 3.4 cP in 10 M KOH. While the

data on molecular and ionic diffusion coefficients in concentrated alkaline solutions are

very  scarce,  it  is  known  that  for  dioxygen  [34]  and  ferro-  and  ferri-  cyanide  [35]  and

formate  [36]  anions  the  product  of  the  diffusion  coefficient  and  the  bulk  viscosity  is

constant in 1-4 M KOH solutions. If this holds for more concentrated alkali solutions,
rxn.  (3)  may  slow  down  because  the  diffusion  of  OH  and  OH-  slows  down  in  these

viscous  solutions.  Interestingly,  we  do  not  observe  such  an  effect  for  migration  of

Figure Captions.

Fig. 1.

Normalized  kinetics  for  266  nm  absorbance  observed  in  200  nm  excitation  of  KOH

solutions.  The  molar  concentrations  used  are  given  in  the  plot  (two  series  of  such

measurements are given together; the detection scheme that was used differed between
these two series). The maximum ∆OD266 signal (after the “1+1” spike) was (2-5)x10-3

OD. No effect of alkaline concentration on the time profile of these kinetics is observed,

despite the fact that  rxn. (3) is expected to be occurring.

Fig. 2.

Transient absorbances at 800 nm (to the left; solid line) and 266 nm (to the right; filled

circles with 95% confidence bars) observed in 400 nm excitation of 1 M KOH. At 800

nm, the absorption signal is from the hydrated electron, at 266 nm – from the hydrated
electron  and  OH  radical.  The  latter  is  expected  to  convert  to  O-  in  80  ps  via  rxn.  (3),

resulting in 23% loss in the total absorbance (section 3). This loss was not observed.

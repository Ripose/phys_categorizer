Abstract 
The  present  paper  develops  an  isothermal  model  for  fast  (high  Deborah  number) 
contraction flows of polymers from a reservoir to a die of circular or rectangular cross-
sections.  Two  components  of  composite  flow  models  in  different  regions  of  the  flow 
domain  are  connected  in  succession  with  the  use  of  asymptotic  matching  boundary 
conditions.  These  components  are  inhomogeneous  elongation  and  a  modified  unsteady 
shearing. It is constructed based on a stable and descriptive set of viscoelastic constitutive 
equations  with  the  specified  material  parameters.  The  present  model  demonstrates  a 
reasonable  good  agreement  to  the  experimental/direct  numerical  data  and  improves  for 
the higher values of Deborah number and contraction ratio cases without any adjustable 
parameters. Also it is applicable to any constitutive equation and performs with easy PC 
numerical calculations. 
 

INTRODUCTION 

 

The  present  paper  develops  an  approximate  analysis  for  fast  isothermal 
contraction  flows  of  polymer  melts.  The  complex  polymer  flows  occur  in  the  axi-
symmetric composite channel shown in Fig.1. It consists of the reservoir (a channel with 
larger cross-sectional area), connected to the die (a channel with smaller cross-sectional 
area).  The  cross-sectional  geometries  of  reservoir  and  die  are  considered  to  be  either 
circular or rectangular, with high ratios of the cross-sectional areas. These geometries are 
widely used in several high-speed polymer processing operations, such as extrusion and 
injection molding, as well as in testing of polymer fluids using slit/capillary rheometers. 
This type of flow also represents a benchmark problem for numerical studies of polymer 
flows  at  high  Deborah  (De)  numbers.  The  complexity  of  these  analyses,  especially  for 
high  De  number  flows,  results  from  nonlinear  viscoelastic  character  of  constitutive 
equations (CE’s) for polymeric liquids and the effect of sudden change in the geometry of 
the composite channels. 

It is convenient to schematically subdivide the entire complex flow domain in five 
characteristic geometric regions: (i) the reservoir pre-entrance, (ii) reservoir entrance, (iii) 
the die entrance, (iv) the die land region, and (v) the die exit region. Additionally there is 
the free surface extrudate swell flow. 
We assume that a developed simple shearing flow of Poiseuille type occurs in the region 
(i) located far away upstream from the die entrance. In the reservoir region (ii), which is 
close  to  the  die  entrance,  the  previous  Poiseuille  flow  dramatically  changes  to  a 
converging type of flow suited for entering the polymer stream in the die. In this region, 
many experiments for polymer melts and all they direct numerical simulations observe a 
secondary flow (vortices) at the reservoir entrance corners. In the developing flow in the 
die entrance region (iii), additional restructuring happens from the upstream converging 
flow back to a simple shearing flow in the die. The developing flow is accompanied by 

 

1

the  release/dissipation  of  the  stored  elastic  energy  accumulated  in  the  previous 
converging  flow.  If  the  die  is  long  enough,  the  die  land  region  (iv)  may  exist  as  a 
continuation  of  the  developing  flow  region.  Here  the  developed  shearing  flow  of 
Poiseuille  type  occurs  whose  characteristics  are  independent  of  the  longitudinal  die 
coordinate. At the very end of the die exit region (v), the die flow restructures once again 
to  the  free-surface  extrudate  flow.  Although  this  type  of  re-structuring  is  dynamically 
important,  it  happens  in  a  relatively  short  region.  Therefore  flow  in  this  region  can  be 
approximately  treated  as  continuing  previous  (developing  or  developed)  flow  up  to  the 
die end with a sudden change in the flow type at the die end cross section. 

Previously  many  experimental  and  computational  works  have  been  done  for  the 
flows  of  polymer  melts  and  solutions  in  the  flow  regions  (ii)-(iv).  Flow  visualization 
experiments, such as laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) [1,2], particle tracer methods [3,4], 
laser  speckle  velocimetry  [5,6]  and  birefringence  methods  [7],  have  been  commonly 
employed to analyze the development of flow patterns near the die entrance.  
The  contraction  type  of  polymer  flow  also  attracted  attention  as  one  of  the  benchmark 
problems  in  computational  viscoelastic  fluid  dynamics.  It  is  because  this  type  of  flow 
involves  the  geometrical  complexity  along  with  non-trivial  set  of  equations  for 
description of momentum, continuity and nonlinear viscoelasticity of polymeric liquids. 
After the extensive review of present finite element method (FEM), the mixed FEM was 
proposed  with  the  demonstration  of  advantages  in  simulating  the  planar  contraction 
problem [8].  

In  the  review  of  the  pre-entrance/entrance  contraction  flow,  White  et  al.  [9] 
pointed  out  that  the  choice  of  CE’s  also  influences  the  numerical  stability  and 
evolutionary  nature  of  CE’s.  Some  numerical  studies  [10,11]  of  fast  viscoelastic  flows 
near  sharp  entrance  corners  revealed  non-convergence  with  mesh  refinement  using  the 
upper convected Maxwell model (UCM). It was partially attributed to the occurrence of 
corner  singularities.  Notable  research  efforts  [12,13]  with  different  CE’s  and  several 
benchmark problems, including the contraction flow, demonstrated that the Leonov type 
of CE is the most stable and the corner singularities do not affect computations for this 
CE up to the value of Deborah number approaching 700 [13].  

Along  with  the  instability  problems,  the  authors  of  Ref.[9]  emphasized  the 
importance of extensional flow in entry flow. They revealed that the common failure of 
numerical prediction of entry flow comes from inabilities of most CE’s to describe well 
both extensional and shear flows. The dominancy of extensional property in fast entrance 
flows of viscoelastic liquids has been discussed many times in experimental papers [7,14]. 
Cogswell [15] first made an effort to confirm his idea using his very simplistic empirical 
flow  model.  Although  in  our  opinion,  this  model  is  of  doubtful  value,  the  Cogswell 
general  idea  seems  to  be  extremely  important  and  has  been  confirmed  in  many 
experimental papers cited above.  

Starting from the paper [15], several attempts were made to develop a simplified 
empirical flow model for the entrance converging flow. The paper [16] tried to improve 
the Cogswell model using empirical equations for simple shearing and simple elongation. 
The papers [17,18] involved in computations a specific CE of simple integral type. They 
calculated  the  stress-strain  rate  relations  in  the  “Protean”  (stream  function-longitudinal) 
coordinate  system  well  known  in  the  theory  of  convective  diffusion  [ 19 ].  In  their 
formulation,  they  also  employed  an  arbitrarily  chosen  “minimum  principle”  with 

 

2

empirical distribution of the longitudinal velocity. In spite of the model arbitrariness and 
unstable character of original simple integral CE, the paper reported successful agreement 
between the model calculations and experimental data. 

The  present  work  develops  a  model  for  high  De  number  contraction  flow  with 
abrupt change in entrance geometry. It starts with a set of general, descriptive, and stable 
CE’s and simplifies the flow complexity using two different characteristics of the flows 
in  different  geometrical  regions.  In  the  pre-reservoir  region  (i),  the  flow  is  modeled  as 
developed  simple  shearing  flow.  Then  following  the  Cogswell  idea  [15],  the  main 
converging  stream  of  polymer  liquid  in  the  reservoir  region  (ii)  is  modeled  as  an 
inhomogeneous  extensional  flow  similar  to  that  employed  in  the  fiber  spinning.  In  the 
region  (iii)  where  the  entrance  die  flow  is  developing,  we  use  once  again  the  CE’s  for 
unsteady  simple  shearing,  with  evolution  of  elastic  strains  originated  from  the  entrance 
reservoir flow. The time derivative is simplistically treated in this unsteady flow model as 
space convective derivative as has been done in many papers before (e.g. see Ref. [20]). 
Additionally,  more  detailed  momentum  balance  equation  is  used  in  the  region  (iii)  to 
stabilize  numerical  calculations.  Finally,  the  characteristics  of  developed  flow  in  the 
region  (iv)  are  calculated  as  limiting  regime  of  flow  in  very  long  tubes.  The  transition 
between  flow  types  in  these  different  flow  regions  is  modeled  by  specific  matching 
boundary conditions. We have also taken into account the viscoelastic drag affected the 
main extensional flow in the region (ii).  

The  presented  flow  model,  designed  to  save  computational  cost,  demonstrates  a 
reasonable  good  agreement  with  existing  experimental  results  and  direct  numerical 
simulations. Additionally, there are two remarkable feature of this approach. The first is 
that no single adjustable parameter is involved in the flow modeling. The second is that 
the  model  calculations  demonstrate  better  comparison  with  experimental  data  or/and 
direct calculations when De number and contraction ratio are increased.

In  the  following,  we  use  a  multi-mode  viscoelastic  CE  of  differential  type.  It  has  been 
recently  employed  [21,22]  for  detailed  and  consistent  description  of  all  experimentally 
available  rheological  data  for  five  polymeric  melts,  while  satisfying  all  the  stability 
constraints [23].

2.2. Modeling the Entrance Contraction Flow  
 
Our schematic interpretation of flow outlined in the Introduction, hypothesizes that two 
basic regions of polymer flow exist in the reservoir. When the reservoir is long enough, 
there  is  the  flow  region  (i)  where  there  is  a  developed  steady  shear  flow  of  polymeric 
melts. We call the flow in this region the far field entrance flow. Additionally, there is the 
flow region (ii) near the die entrance where the main stream of flow converges to the die 
accompanying  sometimes  by  weak  entrance  vortices  at  the  flow  periphery  near  the 
entrance corner. We call the flow in this region the near field entrance flow. Let
1x be the 
axial  coordinate  directed  along  the  symmetry  axis  in  flow  direction  with  the  origin 
( 1
x = ) at the die entrance. Then the far and near field flows are located in the respective 
> −  for  the  region  (ii);  the

coordinate,  1x
l= − ,  being  the  parameter  searched  for.  Although  the  change  of  the  flow 
characters  from  the  far  field  to  the  near  field  entrance  flow  needs  a  small  transitional 
axial length, saying δ, we asymptotically will use the coordinate  1x
l= −  as the boundary 
where sudden change in flow type happens.

We initially approximate the contraction flow in the near field entrance region (ii) 
as an inhomogeneous extensional (or “jet”) flow that commonly occurs either in polymer 
fiber  spinning  or  in  polymer  sheet  processing  operations.  We  assume  that  such  an 
approach  is  approximately  valid  when  the  flow  De  number  is  high  enough.  In  order  to 
compare  our  calculations  with  the  literature  birefringence  data  obtained  for  low  De 
number  flows,  we  then  develop  more  detailed  approach  involving  into  analysis  the 
secondary  shear  flow,  and  include  the  viscoelastic  drag  from  the  near-wall  secondary

flow in dynamics of the jet. We further demonstrate that for moderate De number flows, 
the contribution of the secondary flow might be important for initial development of the 
jet. The details are following “Jet Flow with Drag  from Secondary Viscoelastic  Flows” 
section. However this contribution is insignificant for flows with higher De numbers.

The flow rate in the steady flow Q is constant and considered below as given. When Q is 
, can be found from Eqs.(4), (5) and (6). It enables us to 
specified, the shear rate, 
compute the complete profiles of rheological variables for the steady shear flow up to the 
distance l from the entrance. 
We  employed  in  simple  numerical  procedures  the  Newton-Rhapson  method  to 
 
find the gap-wise shear rate profile for a given value of flow rate Q, while satisfying Eqs. 
(4)-(6). The numerical integration of Eq.(6) was performed using the trapezoidal method. 
We  should  note  that  the  location  of  the  borderline  between  the  far  and  the  near  field 
reservoir entrance flows has not been found yet.

We assume that when flow De number is high enough, the contraction flow in the 
near  field  entrance  region  (ii)  can  be  modeled  as  an  inhomogeneous  extensional,  “jet” 
flow with flat profiles of longitudinal velocity and extensional stress. This assumption is 
directly  based  on  the  Cogswell  idea  [15]  and  the  flow  visualization  experiments  [7], 
where the measured core stress distribution for high enough De number flows becomes 
more jet-like near the die. This simplified rough modeling ignores vortices at the entrance 
corners and neglects the shear effects near the reservoir walls.  

.   

We now consider the jet flow in the slit and circular reservoir geometries. In the 
slit case the jet flow can be approximated as an inhomogeneous planar elongation flow. 
In the  circular case, we  use the inhomogeneous  simple elongation approximation. Then 
the  corresponding  expressions  for  the  matrices  of  elastic  strain  tensors,

Jet Flow with Drag from Secondary Viscoelastic Flows 
We now present a simplified analysis of the secondary shear flow effect in the modeling 
of “jet flow”. Even if this effect is negligible when the value of De number is high enough, 
the  birefringence  data  [7]  obtained  for  moderate  flow  rates,  clearly  show  that  the  drag 
from the secondary shear flow outside of the core jet creates an extra force affecting the 
jet development. It is uneasy to distinguish in this case the difference between the core jet 
(elongation)  flow  and  near-wall  secondary  (shear)  flow.  To  avoid  this  uncertainty  and 
keep  computational  simplicity,  we  simply  define  the  jet  as  the  near-axial  stream  that 
completely  contributes  to  the  flow  rate.  It  means  that  the  secondary  flow  is  circulatory 
and  confined  in  a  closed,  wedge-shape  domain  near  the  corner.  The  circulatory  flow  is 
overwhelmingly  observed  in  numerous  experimental  data  for  high  De  number  polymer 
flows and its existence was well documented in all direct computations. Then including 
the viscoelastic drag from the near-wall secondary flow in dynamics of the jet, results in 
calculating the effect of secondary flows on the normal force and jet sizes. We will model 
the secondary shear flow using the lubrication layer approximation (LLA) [20], which is 
commonly applied to a wedge-like shearing between two well-defined solid boundaries. 
In our case the difficulty is that the jet profile is unknown and searched for. 

Within  the  LLA  approach,  the  momentum  balance  equations  for  the  secondary

from  Eq.  (19,  19*).  It  is  easy  to  understand  that  the  circulatory  shear  flow  model  will 
decrease  the  jet  length  1l .  This  is  because  the  drag  increases  the  extensional  jet  force, 
which in turn makes the jet thinner. Therefore when the initial (reservoir) and final (die) 
area are fixed the transition from the initial and final jet thickness is getting shorter. 
 
Matching Condition at the Boundary Between the two Entrance Flow Regions.  
The  jet  flow  model  has  not  yet  been  completed  because  the  initial  elastic  stretches 
in  Eq.(13,  13*)  are  unknown.  To  determine  them  we  employ  at  the

unknown boundary,
l= − , an energetic matching condition (A4) derived in Appendix A 
for each kth nonlinear Maxwellian mode. This energetic condition, proposed at hoc first in 
Ref.  [52],  provides  the  modeling  opportunity  for  asymptotic  matching  of  various  flow 
parameters (homogeneously or inhomogeneously distributed) in different regions of flow 
at an effective “interface” with discontinuities in the values of these parameters. In real 
flows,  these  parameters  are  certainly  changed  continuously  from  one  asymptotic  flow 
region  to  another.  The  description  of  these  continuous  changes  is  the  subject  of  direct 
numerical simulations.

calculated  value  of 
(22) represent a simple model for steady entrance flow calculations. Mathematically, this 
problem is reduced to a well-defined boundary value problem with the parameter l being 
the  eigenvalue.  The  above  model  for  reservoir  flow  also  provides  the  calculations  of 
developing flow in the die with appropriate boundary conditions. 

We  used  in  our  calculations  a  numerical  procedure  with  trapezoidal  integration 
and  the  root  finding  routine  for  Eq.(22),  along  with  the  Newton-Raphson  methods  for 
solving Eq. (11) and (12) until the boundary condition (14) is satisfied.  

When  De  number  and  the  contraction  ratio  of  the  flow  are  not  high  enough  to 
satisfy our prior assumptions for the jet flow model, the other set of force condition for 
the  jet  model  with  drag  from  secondary  shear  flow  may  work  better.  The  calculations 
using this more complicated model have been demonstrated in the previous Section and 
in Appendix B. 

Although the described jet approach oversimplifies the reservoir near field flow in 
l= − , it is getting more realistic when the flow is closer to the entrance. It

In order to find the boundary conditions at the entrance,  1

conditions (A4) from Appendix A for matching the jet flow in the reservoir and entrance 
shearing flow in the die. Two simplifying assumptions are used. We firstly assume that 
all  the  “initial”  variables  at  the  beginning  (
x = )  of  the  developing  die  flow  are 
1
distributed  homogeneously  across  the  entrance  cross-section.  This  is  in  accord  with 
calculations [20] of developing viscous flows. We secondly assume that the shear stress 
at the entrance cross-section  1
x =  is absent. This follows from the well-known fact that 
after sudden imposition of shear velocity, there is no instant shear stress response. Using 
conditions (A4) with the above assumptions yields for any

initial conditions (29) for the plain die flow, the condition 
 in (29*) resulting from 
the  third  equation  in  (23),  makes  impossible  to  use  the  continuity  condition  for  elastic 
strains at  1

The  problem  formulated  by  equations  (23)-(27)  along  with  boundary  conditions

transitional flow between the near field entrance, elongation jet flow and the developed 
shear Poiseuille flow, asymptotically achieved  as  1x → ∞ .  It  means that the developing

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 

All the calculations in this paper are performed for isothermal viscoelastic flows 
under a given value of flow rate, using the general CE’s (1), (2) with the specification of 
scaling relaxation factor  b given in Table 1. It should be noted that LDPE Melt 1 needs a 
special  modeling  [24,25]  for  the  function  b as  shown  in  Table  1  and  Eqs.  (1)-(2).  The 
following  necessary  information  is  needed  for  comparing  model  calculations  with 
experimental  data  or  direct  numerical  simulations.  We  firstly  need  the  rheological 
characterization  of  the  polymer  system,  which  could  provide  us  with  the  knowledge  of 
the  discrete  relaxation  spectrum {
kG θ .  We  secondly  need  the  experiments  or  direct 
computations that present at least some space distributions of stress and/or velocity fields. 
We  thirdly  need  a  precise  description  of  the  geometry  with  a  sharp  entrance  transition, 
used in these research papers.

Additionally the contraction flows of a dilute polymer solution are not fit for our model. 
Although it is not difficult to incorporate the pure viscous (solvent) term in Eqs. (1)-(2), 
the problem is that the flow De number for these solutions is not high enough to apply 
our modeling. We also think that a high increase in De number will also highly increase 
the Reynolds number, involving significant inertia effects. Thus because of infeasibility 
to  compare  our  model  calculations  with  data  or  direct  numerical  simulations  for  other 
polymer  systems,  we  consider  the  results  of  below  comparative  studies  only  as 
preliminary.  

Before  discussing  the  comparison  between  calculations  and  data  we  should 
remind once  again that  both  the  flow De number and contraction ratio are significant  in 
modeling of viscoelastic contraction flows. 

For the slit channel flow, we use the experimental data [7] with discrete relaxation 
spectrum (Maxwellian modes) for a polyisobutylene (Vistanex). For the circular channel 
contraction flows, the data for another type of polyisobytylene (LM-MH) were used. We 
obtained the Maxwellian modes shown in Table3 employing the Pade-Laplace procedure 
[26]  from  the  linear  dynamic  data  and  stress  relaxation  experiments  using  the  disc-disc 
fixture  in  RMS  800  rheometer.  It  should  also  be  noted  that  our  CE  describes  well  the 
uniaxial  elongation  data  obtained  using  an  elongation  rheometer  of  Messner  type.  The 
MPT  (Monsanto  Processability  Tester)  instrument  with  circular  channel  geometry  and 
piston speed control was also used in our experiments. Along with the values of material 
characteristics,  the  values  of  geometrical  parameters  noted  in  Fig.  1  are  displayed  in 
Tables 2 and 3. Figure  2 sketches various flow regions presented in our modeling. The 
far field reservoir entrance and the die flow are described as Poiseuille type flows and the 
near field reservoir flow is approximated as elongation flow type. Supplemental picture 
in Figure 2 also sketches the jet with secondary circulatory shear flow.  

Figure  3  illustrates  the  comparison  between  our  calculations  and  experimental 
data [7] for Vistanex. These data were obtained at certain axial positions for the near field 
entrance jet flow. Here the filled circles indicate experimental data and solid lines stand 
for our calculations with jet without drag. Figure 3 is suitable for die 2 (see Table 2). The 
data  for  stress  invariant  were  obtained  in  [7]  from  birefringence  experiments  using  the 
stress-optical “law”:

model  predicts  well  enough  the  flow  details  for  the  rest  of  the  region.  Therefore  we

expect  that  for  larger  De  numbers,  the  model  assumption  of  shortening  the  transient 
length (
δ → between  the  far  and  near  field  reservoir  regions  will  be  more  suitable. 
Having only few experimental points for flow in die 1, we cannot say that the additional 
shear  drag  in  the  near  field  entrance  could  significantly  improve  the  stress  distribution. 
But it makes much more improvement in our calculations of flow in the die 2 (Fig. 3.) as 
compared to the experimental data. 

Figure.  4A  presents  the  comparison  between  experimental  data  and  our 
computations for the pressure difference between two transducers shown  in Fig.1. Here 
we  used  Eq.  (30)  with  certain  flow  rate  values.  According  to  Eq.  (30),  the  near  field 
reservoir region does not directly contribute in the total pressure. However, it indirectly 
affects the pressure drop in the developing die flow via the initial values of elastic strains. 
Therefore, as far as the model describes fairly the developing flow region with reasonable 
initial values at the die entrance, we expect a good agreement of our calculations with the 
data for plots of pressure drop versus flow rate. Figure 4A shows that both the types of 
above modeling,  with  and  without account of jet’s  drag, coincide and  describe well the 
data. Our computations also show that the extensional force with extra shear drag (dashed 
line) slightly increases the pressure drop (
1P∆ ) in the reservoir region as compared to the 
pure jet approach (solid line). It happens because of shortening the length of extended jet.

both model types estimate quite successfully the initial values of elastic strains for the die

We now consider  the comparison of our calculations with experimental data for 
another  polyisobutylene  (LM-MH).  Figure  5  (A-D)  demonstrates  basic  rheological 
properties  for  this  material.  The  data  in  Figs.5A,B,C  were  obtained  using  the  disc-disc 
fixture of RMS 800 instrument, and the data in Fig.5.D, using an elongation rheometer of 
the  Messner  type.  Employing  the  Pade-Laplace  method  [26],  we  obtained  the  value  of 
parameters in discrete relaxation spectrum from the dynamic (A) and the stress relaxation 
(B)  experiments  in  linear  region.  From  steady  simple  shear  experiments  with  different 
temperatures (Fig.5C), we found the activation energy using the Arrhenius equation, and 
confirmed the time-temperature superposition. Using in nonlinear region the multi-mode 
constitutive  approach  (1)-(3)  with  these  Maxwell  modes,  we  described  experimental 
results in Fig. 6, including the uniaxial elongation (Fig.5D).

Figures 7A,B demonstrates the centerline velocity and pressure profiles along the 
circular channel at De number about 250 using the jet flow models with and without drag, 
respectively.  Because  there  is  a  big  difference  between  the  lengths  of  the  two  modeled 
reservoir  jets,  we  changed  the  scale  for  negative  (reservoir)  values  of  longitudinal 
variable  1x in Fig. 7A. Our calculations qualitatively agree with the experimental results 
obtained by Paskhin [1] who demonstrated that the centerline velocity goes first through 
the  maximum  and  finally  stabilizes.  Direct  comparison  with  data  [1]  was  impossible 
because  Paskhin  used  a  reservoir  with  entering  cone  and  also  did  not  report  important 
material  characteristics.  The  comparison  between  the Figures  7  A  and  B  show  that  the 
simple  jet  model  predicts  longer  length  of  reservoir  jet  and  shorter  length  of  the 
developing  die flow  region  than  the  more realistic model of the  reservoir jet with  drag. 
E.g.  Fig.7A  shows  that  the  longer  dimensionless  length  ( 16)
of  the  developing  flow 
(evaluated  by  the  axial  velocity  profile)  needed  for  the  jet  with  drag  flow  model  as 
compared  to  that ( 5)≈
for  the  jet  flow  only.  The  reason  for  this  difference  is  longer 
relaxation  of  higher  values  of  initial  elastic  strains  at  the  die  entrance,  which  is 
characteristic  for  the  model  of  jet  flow  with  drag.  One  can  also  see  that  for  both  the 
models of calculations, the length of developing flow, evaluated by the pressure profile, 
is considerably less than that evaluated by the axial velocity profile. It indicates that the 
stabilization  of  pressure  gradient  does  not  completely  describe  the  developing  flow 
region.

The  contraction  flow  in  Ref.  [27]  was  investigated  using  LDPE  melt  (LDPE 
Lupolen 1810 H from BASF Ludwigshafen; Charge number 912 133 036). According to 
the experimental descriptions, the experiments were performed using 10:1 (reservoir/die) 
slit contraction controlled by the constant plunger speeds at a temperature of 150°C. At 
and  the  zero-shear-rate 
this  temperature,  the  density  of  the  material  is 
viscosity  is  approximately 
.  The  average  axial  velocities  in  the  die  were 
the ranged from 4.6 mm/s to 49.3 mm/s. No flow instability was observed. In  addition, 
creeping  flow  conditions  existed  during  all  experiments.  Laser  Doppler  velocimetry 
(LDV)  was  used  to  measure  three-dimensional  velocity  field.  The  detail  material 
characterization and 10:1 slit dimension are indicated in Table 1 and 4.  
Here,  instead  directly  employing  their  14  Maxwellian  modes,  we  used  8  modes  from 
Laun [28] for characterizing LDPE. Preferably we try to use Pade-Laplace method [26], 
well-posed computer program to extract Maxwellian mode from the experimental data in 
linear  region,  but  it  could  not  happen  due  to  no  stress  relaxation  data  available. 
Nevertheless  using  8  modes  by  Laun  and  carefully  chosen  non-dimensional  parameter 
shown in Table 1, we were able to describe all basic experiments as shown Fig. 8. Once 
again, there were two kinds of flow types used in our modeling, shearing and extensional, 
through  all  flow  characteristic  regions.  Therefore  the  preliminary  characterization  of 
LDPE is expected working well for the model when it agrees reasonably as Fig. 8. 
Upon  our  selection  of  Maxwellian  modes,  the  average  material  characterization  time  is

and 2.25e-6 m3/s from the low De number. 

Figures  9  illustrates  our  model  predictions  and  experiments  for  centerline  axial 
velocity  at  3  different  De  number  flows.  Figure  9A  is  computed  using  “Jet  Approach” 
and Fig. 9B  is done  using  “Jet Flow with Drag from Secondary  Viscoelastic  Flows”  in 
the  above  section.  Comparing  Fig.  9A  and  B,  the  most  significant  difference  in  model 
prediction  is  reservoir  converging  length.  For  the  same  value  of  the  given  flow  rate 
condition, the jet approach alone shows much longer converging length in reservoir than 
the  jet  with  drag  approach.  It  is  because  the  extra  force  contribution  by  the  secondary 
drag  made  the  core  jet  shorten  its  converging  path.  In  another  words,  the  more  force 
acting  on  the  extensional  flow,  the  less  consuming  time/path  to  reach  from  one  cross-
section area to another under the given condition.  
Here with “jet approach” model, the near field flow predictions do not work well in Fig. 
9A, because the demonstrated De numbers of LDPE may not be high enough. However, 
with “jet with drag”, they show good agreements as Fig. 9B. Interestingly enough, with 
both  model,  the  die  flow  predictions  match  well  to  the  experimental  data.  Even  if  the 
more  detail  investigation  of  the  die  developing  flow  needs  to  be  followed,  the  jet 
approach  approximates  the  deformation  profile  at  the  die  entrance  roughly  fair  for  the 
centerline velocities data. 
On the comparison with the original simulations, presented in Fig.9C, our models make 
better results in the die entrance and developing region flow. The both figured the axial 
length  about  10~20  in 
x L  where  the  land  region  achieved.  However,  The  original 
1 / D
simulations  under-estimate  the  die  developing  behaviors,  even  with  higher  values  of 
experimental  flow  rate.  Also  it  seems  that  the  deviation  of  their  simulation  to 
experimental data increases for the higher De number flows.  

Figure  10  is  showing  the  velocity  profiles  at  1 /

 for  each  De  numbers. 
The  shown  computations  (lines)  are  obtained  using  the  “jet  with  drag”  model. 
Unfortunately the measurements are only available about at the land region, which may 
achieve by the steady state calculations. Therefore the detail developing behavior of die 
flow,  the  most  interesting  in  the  contraction  flow,  could  not  seen  with  Fig.  10. 
Nevertheless the all predictions, including jet approach models and the original literature 
simulation, agree as well as it shows with the experimental data.

4. CONCLUSIONS 
 

Many  published  literature  data  do  not  provide  necessary  information  for  our  modeling. 
Therefore  we  were  unable  to  compare  our  model  calculations  with  many  direct 
calculations  and/or  experimental  data.  Nevertheless,  the  comparison  of  our  model 
calculations  with  available  literature  results  demonstrated  that  our  model  captures  the 
most  essential  features  of  contraction  flow  with  considerably  less  computational  effort 
than  direct  computations.  Thus  we  think  that  the  main  objective  of  our  modeling, 
evaluating  the  entrance  reservoir  contraction  flow  and  its  effect  on  high  De  number 
polymer flow in die, is fulfilled.  

There  are  remarkable  advantages  in  our  model  predictions,  such  as  better 
agreement with experimental data at the higher De numbers (high-speed processing) and 
higher  contraction  ratios,  which  are  the  well  known  as  troublesome  conditions  for 
existing direct computational methods. Additionally (i) the model employs a complicated 

 

17

but  very  realistic  rheological  model  in  a  geometrically  simplified  manner,  and  (ii)  the 
model operates with well-defined rheological parameters and does not use any adjustable 
parameters. 

Since the model approximately traces entire deformation history of the flow, it is 
possible  to  apply  it  for  calculating  swelling  in  short  dies.  This  analysis  will  be 
demonstrated  in  the  near  future.  Also  computational  analyses  of  non-isothermal 
contraction flows are relatively easy to carry out using the presented model. An example 
of such an analysis will be followed. 
 
entrance flows as a polymer wall slip, can also be treated within the presented model.

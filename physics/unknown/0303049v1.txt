Abstract 
 
Multiwire  and  microstrip  porous  detectors  have  been  developed  and  investigated  for  DC  
operation.  The  multiwire  porous  detector  consists  of  anode  wires,  an  Al  cathode  and  a  gap  between 
them  filled  with  porous  CsI.  The  microstrip  porous  detector  consists  of  an  insulating  plate  covered 
with metallic strips, micromesh anode and a gap between them filled with porous CsI. For some time 
after  being  manufactured,  these  detectors’  performances  are  non-stable  and  they  have  poor  spatial 
resolution.  However,  after  being  kept  in  vacuum  for  a  certain  time,  they  spontaneously  acquire 
stability and spatial resolution better than 100 µm and have detection efficiencies of 100% and 70% 
for heavily ionizing α-particles and 5.9 keV X-rays respectively. The MWPDD performs stably at an 
intensity of heavily ionizing α –particles of 711cm-2 s-1.

1. Introduction 

The development of many areas of science, engineering, biology and medicine are tightly bound 
(interlinked) to methods of registration of particles and Х-rays. Therefore, the search for new methods 
of registration of radiation has been a priority direction in physics. One of the methods developed for 
ionizing  radiation  detection  during  the  last  30  years  is  the  method  of  porous  dielectric  detectors 
(PDD).  In  this  detector,  electrons  drift  and  multiply  (EDM)  in  porous  dielectrics  (PD)  under  the 
influence  of  an  external  electric  field.  Success  in  this  direction  came  from  groups  at  the  Yerevan 
Physics  Institute  where  that  phenomenon  was  observed  and  porous  detectors  were  developed  and 
systematically studied [1-5]. The multiplication of electrons takes place because of secondary electron 
emission from the walls of pores allowing porous detectors  to have good time and spatial resolutions. 
For  porous  detectors,  active  materials  such  as  KCl,  CsI,  KBr,  Na3AlF6,  MgO  and  others  having  a 
density of a few percent of the bulk density were used. The EDM in PD with an external electric field 
has  been  demonstrated  as  controllable  by  the  electric  field  and  provides  a  very  high  yield  σ  of 
secondary electrons per incident heavily or minimum ionizing particles. These detectors are very thin 
having an extremely small amount of matter in the path of the particle (~ 200µg/cm2)[1-9]. Anomalous 
secondary  electron  emission (ASEE-Malter effect  [10], which occurs in the field of positive charges 
accumulated on the surface of a porous emitter, also provides a very high secondary electron emission 
factor σ for low energy and intensity electron beams [11 -17]. Moreover, according to estimations of 
E.J.  Sternglass  et  al.,  for  1-10  MeV  α-particles  and  β-particles  the  ASEE  σ  can  reach  103  and  4 
respectively and the formation time should not exceed 0,5⋅10-10 s [18]. In 1965 Garwin et al., [19,20] 
have shown that the ASEE factor for porous emitters in the case of a high energy electron beam has σ 
≈  5  and  for  ≈  2  MeV  single  β-particles  σ  ≈  1.  Such  small  values  of  σ  for  single  weakly  ionizing 
particles are caused by the method of creation of the electric field in the porous emitter. This method 
consists of the following: before irradiating with the particles to be detected, the emitter is bombarded 
by  an  intense  low-energy  (~  10  keV)  electron  beam.  The  electron  beam  traversing  the  porous  layer 
knocks  secondary  electrons  out  of  the  surface,  with  the  remaining  positive  ions  creating  an  electric 
field  in  the  porous  dielectric.  The  main  drawback  of  this  method  is  that  simultaneously  with  the 
accumulation of the positive charges on the layer’s surface, charges accumulate also inside this layer 
(on  the  surfaces  of  pores  and  inside  the  walls).  These  bulk  charges  capture  electrons  and  holes 
produced  by  the  radiation  being  detected  and  suppress  the  intensity  of  the  EDM  and  SEE.  They 
increase  the  fluctuations  of  SEE  gain  and  introduce  different  kinds  of  instabilities,  since  density  of 
those  charges  is  directly  related  to  the  primary  particles  intensity.  In  the  main,  because  of  these 
disadvantages  and  owing  to  such  an  inconvenient  method  for  the  creation  of  an  electric  field  in  the 
porous emitter,  ASEE is not used for single particle detection.  

Having assumed, that all these problems do not arise when an external electric field is used, Lorikyan 
et al., [1,2] in the early 1970’s tested porous secondary emitters with an applied external electric field. 
Using this method, the authors observed secondary electron emission (CSEE) [1-4] highly controllable 
by an external electric field. Besides, the use of an external field makes it possible to observe a SEE 
from thick layers by applying higher electric fields and have led to the development of a series of new 
radiation  detectors.  The  emitter  used  in  above  mentioned  experiments  consisted  of  the  thin  metallic 
foil  covered  with  porous  KCl  with  relative  density  ρrel  =  2%  of  the  bulk density  and a fine metallic 
control  grid  which  is  located  on  the  surface  of  KCl  layer  or  is  placed  at  some  distance  from  this 
surface.  An  external  electric  field  was  applied  between  the  cathode  and  control  grid.  Investigations 
have  shown  that  for  I  ≈  3.2⋅10  –  10A  of  50  MeV  incident  electron  beam  traversing  the  emitter,  the 
secondary electron yield σ sharply increases with electric field and reaches σ = 32.  When the grid was 
located  on  the  surface  of  a  porous  KCl  film,  secondary  electrons  appeared  immediately  after  the 
beginning  of  bombardment,  however,  when  the  grid  was  not  in  contact  with  the  film, the maximum 
value of σ was reached in the course of time, i.e. in the last case inertial SEE is observed.  However, 
the advantages of the external electric field were displayed in full when the porous emitter was shot

through by a single minimum ionizing β-particle.  Lorikyan et al. have shown that in this case, σ also 
grows sharply with the electric field E (see fig.1) but reaches a higher value (220) than in the previous 
case [3,4]. It is worth noting, that the mean free path λ of electrons in the porous layer for an electron 
beam is λ ≈ 1.0 µm [1,2], but for single particles λ ≈ 10 µm [3,4].  Such a large difference between the 
values of σ and λ for beams and single incident particles is due to the fact that beams produce a very 
large bulk charge in the porous layer while for single particles, the polarization charge is small.  The 
relatively high average values of secondary electron energies of ε ≈ 60eV and ε ≈ 20eV for E = 4×104 
V/cm and E = 2×104 V/cm [3,4] ensure the fast signal of porous detectors. One of the drawbacks of 
this method is that the statistical distributions of secondary electrons [3-5,21-23] for both weakly and 
heavily  ionising  particles  are  too  wide  and  not  suitable  for  energy  measurements,  although  for  5.5 
MeV α-particles 100% detection efficiency and σ ≈ 2×103 was obtained [5-9].  

Fig. 1  The dependences of σ on the electric field strength for various thicknesses of porous KCl layer for minimum 
ionizing β-particles traversing emitter [3,4]. 

 

Thus a high quality of operation of porous detector is ensured by: 1) applying the external electric 
field; 2) with the contacts to the anode and cathode electrodes on the surfaces of the porous layer; 3) 
relatively high secondary electron energies; 4) small sizes of pores (which limit the transverse size of 
the electron avalanche and determines the spatial resolution of the detector). These requirements were 
first  met  in  multiwire  and  microstrip  porous  dielectric  detectors    (MWPDD)  [24-34].  Using  the 
obtained values of λ≈10 µm, ε=50eV, for 1.5-2.5 MeV β-particles the number of electrons collected 
on  anode  wires  for    MWPDD  with  thickness  and  density  of  porous  KCl  layer  300  µm  and  2% 
respectively was estimated to be M ∼ 6×104 [34] the registration efficiencies of 5,5 MeV α-particles, 
minimum  ionizing  β-particles  and  5.9  keV  X-rays  and  their  time  and  coordinate  resolutions  were 
shown to be very good [27,30]. The disadvantage of these detectors was that they operated stably only 
in the pulsed mode, i.e. when after a short time of operation (from several milliseconds to one second) 
the MWPDD is fed with a pulse of inverse polarity [28,29]. Detailed information on PDDs is available 
in ref [34].  

A SEE of porous dielectric emitters was also studied in 1983 by Cheehab et al. [35] with ~10–9A 25 
MeV electrons beam and in 1989 by Chianelli et al., [36] using >1 MeV β-particles and 5,5 MeV α–
particles. The emitters used in [38,39] had no metallic control grid on the surface of the porous layer 
and  the  anode  electrode  was  not  in  contact  with  porous  layer.    In  reference[36]  when  the  voltage 
turned on, the σ for these particles was about 15 and 2000 respectively, and then it fell. In that work 
the detection efficiency of 0.95 for 540 MeV protons was achieved.  

The high secondary emission properties of alkali-halides aroused intense interest and yields from 
various porous and solid CsI emitters were observed in gas atmospheres [37-52]. Of course, not only 
alkali-halides, but also any other efficient secondary electron emitters can be used as an active media 
of such detectors. A relevant example could be the so called micro sphere plates operating in the DC 
mode, in which pores are the spaces between the spheres [53-55].

In  recent  works  [56-58]  it  was  found  that  under  certain  conditions  the  performances  of  porous 
multiwire and microstrip  detectors are stable even in the DC mode of operation and they have good 
coordinate resolution 

This paper presents the results of a study in the DC mode of multiwire porous dielectric detectors 
(MWPDDs)  and  microstrip  porous  dielectric  detectors  (MSPDDs)  filled  with  porous  CsI.  Most 
investigations  were  made  for  source  intensities  I  ≤  12  cm-2  sec-1  and  detectors  had  CsI  with  purity 
99.99, while counting rate capabilities were studied for α –particles with intensity of I = 711cm-2 s-1 
and  higher  CsI  layer  purity  (99.999).  Studies  with  5.5  MeV  α  –particles  and  5,9  keV  X-  rays  were 
performed. Numerous porous detector prototypes have been tested and the results of typical detectors 
are presented.  
 
2. Principles of Operation of Porous Dielectric Detectors  

    
Note that the phenomenon of EDM in porous dielectrics under the action of an external electric 
field have not been sufficiently well studied yet. The absence of a quantitative theory of the EDM in 
porous dielectrics under the influence of an external electric field seriously restricts the development 
of porous dielectric detectors and the possibility of interpretation of obtained results.  

   Qualitatively the process of EDM in porous dielectrics can be described as follows: in the pore 
walls of the material, primary particles create electrons in a conduction band and holes in the valence 
band. Electrons with energies higher than the electron affinity  χ of the wall surface penetrate through 
the  walls  into  the  vacuum  in  the  pores  i.e.  secondary  electrons  emission  (SEE)  arises.  Secondary 
, where e is 
electrons are accelerated in the pores by the applied electric field up to energy of 
charge of electron,  λ is the electron's free path in porous medium and E is the electric field strength. 
The  accelerated  electrons  produce  new  secondary  electrons  and  holes  in  the  medium.  This  process 
repeats  producing  an  avalanche  multiplication  of  electrons  (holes).  A  high  value  of  σι of  dielectric 
emitters used in porous detectors is the result of a large band gap W of dielectrics (W = 4 - 8 eV) and 
relatively  low  electron  affinity  of  these  materials  [59].  High  values of W are necessary since in  that 
case more electrons participate in EDM, which is due to the fact, that conducting band electrons with 
energy  ε  <  W  (in  slightly  defective  crystal  lattice)  do  not  interact  with  the  valence-band  electrons, 
hence their energy losses in dielectrics are low. As a result the mean energy of electrons in conducting 
band  of  dielectrics  is  high,  the  electron’s  penetration  depth  Z  is  large  and  the  number  of  electrons 
reaching  the  pore  surface  with  energy  sufficient  to  overcome  the  surface  barrier  is  high.  As  a 
consequence  of  the  low  electron  affinity,  more  valence-band  electrons  exit  into  the  pores  and 
participate in the process of EDM.   Table 1 gives the values of a W, Z, χ, and σ for some materials, 
(Z and σ are obtained for primary electron energies of 1-5 keV) [60]

From  this  table,  we  see  that  CsI  has  a  high  value  of  W  and  the  lowest  value  of  χ  and  therefore  is 
Using  the  value  of  the  free  path  λ=10µm 
suitable as an active medium for porous detectors.

[4], one can estimate, that a porous CsI layer with a density of 
thickness of the walls is about 1000 Å, which   is close to the value of the Z of CsI (see Table.1). This

and the small value of the χ= 0.1 eV are responsible for the high gain of the porous CsI layer in the 
external electric field.  

  However  all  aforesaid  is  not  sufficient  for  complete  description  of  the  EDM  processes  in 
porous  emitters.  The  defects  in  a  crystalline  structure  and  the  impurities  in  a  porous  medium  act  as 
traps of electrons and holes. Trapped electrons and holes form bulk and surface charges, which reduce 
the EDM efficiency and spoil all characteristics of detectors. We can conclude that a dielectric porous 
detector  with  active  medium  having  a  noticeable  density  of  traps  has  poor  spatial  and  energy 
resolutions and unstable characteristics. That is why the purities of the material and of the procedure of 
detector  manufacturing  are  very  important  [61].  The  effect  of  polarization  charges  on  counting 
characteristics of the porous detectors was observed already in our early studies [24-33]. 

 
    3.Description and assembly of Porous Dielectric Detectors 
     
3.1. MWPDD 
 
The MWPDD look like gaseous multiwire proportional chambers, where porous materials 
replace the gas. The design of the MWPDD is presented schematically in fig.2. The anode was made 
of the 25-micron diameter gold plated wires. The cathode was made of 60 µm rigid type of Al foil 
stretched on a fiberglass frame. Insulator spacer of 0.5 mm thickness set the gap between wires and 
cathode, which was filled with porous CsI. MWPDDs with different spacing between anode wires b 
were tested in these studies. α-particles and X-quanta enter into the porous medium from anode wires 
side and through the Al foil cathode respectively.  

    The MWPDD was assembled in this way: the gold plated wires were stretched between two 
screws with the help of a tension of 65g, and then they were fastened onto the fiberglass frame (anode 
frame) by epoxy. The cathode Al foil was stretched using two metallic round frames, and then cathode 
frame was glued to it.   

The openings of anode and cathode frames determine the active area of detectors. For assembly 
of the MWPDD, a porous CsI with thickness L is sputtered on the cathode and then the anode wires 
were brought into contact with CsI layer and frames were fixed to each other. 

Microscopic studies of the surface of the detector revealed that the immersion of the wires into

 the porous layer is very small, their action results mainly in the compression of the layer.

3.2.  MSPDD  
The design of the MSPDD is presented schematically in fig.3. In the MSPDD gold strips were 
lithographically  deposited  onto  the  glass-ceramic  plate  (readout  plate)1.  The  width  of  strips  was  20 
µm, the distance between their centers was 100 µm. The resistance of each strip attained 50 Ω. The 
cathode  was  made  of  0.7  transparency  micromesh.  An  insulator  spacer  of 0.5 mm thickness sets the 
gap between strips and cathode and it was filled with porous CsI. 

The  MSPDD  was  assembled  as  follows:  the  cathode  micromesh  is  stretched  and  glued  on  the 
cathode  frame  in  the  same  manner  as  Al  cathode  foil  of  MWPDD.  Primarily  the  readout  plate  was 
glued  to  the  fiberglass  substrate,  after  that  porous  CsI  of  thickness  L  was  deposited  on  strips  of  the 
readout plate. The micromesh cathode was placed on the CsI layer and cathode frame was fixed to the 
readout plate substrate.  

 
 
4. Description and production of porous CsI layer.  
 

To provide a good technological cleanliness, all parts of the detectors were in advance cleansed 

chemically and were repeatedly washed in distilled water and dried at a room temperature.  

The porous CsI layer is prepared by thermal deposition from a tantalum boat in the atmosphere 
of low argon pressure [38]. The boat was chemically cleansed beforehand. The relative density of the 
CsI layer just after deposition was ρrel ≈ 0.4%. This density is obtained for argon pressure p = 3 Torr, 
the distance from the boat to substrate H = 6.5 cm and deposition rate of 56 µm/min. The accuracy in 
determining  of  ρ  was  12  %.  The  thickness  of  porous  layer  L  was  measured  with  micrometer  in  the 
ambient  Ar  immediately  after  the  deposition.  As  the  porous  layer  is  very  soft,  the  accuracy  of 
measurement of L was poor (≈ 50 µm). The non uniformity of the CsI layer thickness over the area 
just after deposition didn’t exceed the measurement accuracy of 50 µm.  

It was observed that the thickness of porous CsI layer kept in vacuum decreases with time. The 
results  of  measurements  of  the  CsI  layer  thickness  changes  with  time  are  given  in  fig.4.  Since  this 
decrease  may  result  in  the  loss  of  the  contact  between  the  CsI  and  the  cathode  of  the  MSPDD  (or 
anode wires of MWPDD), the CsI layer was prepared with a thickness L exceeding that of the detector 
gap by a factor of 1.5-2.  

The compression of the CsI layer could take place also under the action of the external electric 

field. The effect of an electric field on the gap filled with porous CsI was studied by an optical

4.1 Detectors setting up in the device 
 
The  emission  properties  of  a  porous  layer  deteriorates  in  time  if  it  is  in  contact  with  air.  To 
exclude  such  changes,  the  detectors  which  were  assembled  in  the  box  with  argon,  were  moved  in 
argon  to  experimental  setup  and  were  quickly  installed  in  the  experimental  vacuum  chamber.  The 
vacuum chamber, which was beforehand filled with argon, was then brought rapidly to a vacuum of ≈ 
7 × 10-3 Torr.  
 
   5. Measurement procedure.  
 
The  amplifier  used  for  amplification  of  detector's  pulses  had  a  rise  time  of  1.5  ns,  a  250-Ohm 
input  impedance,  and  a  conversion  ratio  of  30  mV/µA.  After  amplification  the  signals  were 
discriminated with a threshold Vthr and were registered by counters.  

Both  N(s),  the  numbers  of  particles  detected  by  only  one  anode  wire  or  strip  and  N(c),  the 
number of particles detected simultaneously by two adjacent anode wires or strips were measured. The 
total  number  of  detected  particles  is  N(s+c)  =  N(s)  +  N(c).  We  denote  the  corresponding  detection 
efficiencies by η(s), η(c) and η(s+c) respectively, η(s+c)= η(s) + η(c). This allows us to measure the 
detection efficiency of particles and simultaneously to evaluate the upper limit of the spatial resolution 
of detectors. To do that the anode wires of the MWPDD (or strips of the MSPDD) were divided into 
two groups (see fig. 5).  

 

Fig. 5  Schematic view of the partition of anode wires or strips into two groups and basic diagram for measuring the 
efficiency and coordinate resolution: A – amplifier; D – discriminator; AND – coincidence; N(I), N(II), N(III) – counters. 

 
The  first  group  included  the  even-numbered  and  the  second  group  included  the  odd-numbered 
anode wires or strips. Anode wires (strips) in each group were connected with each other and numbers 
of  signals  from  first  group  N(I)  and  second  group  N(II)  were  separately  amplified  and  counted.  The 
number of coincidence pulses from both groups of wires (strips) Nc was also counted. Therefore, Nc ≡ 
N(c), N (s) = N(I) + N(II) - 2N(c). It is clear that when in the porous dielectric detector the width of the 
electron  shower  is  much  smaller  than  b,  the  parameter  Ss  =  N(c)/N(s+c)  «  1  and  detector  spatial 
resolution is not worse than b. When the width of the electron shower in the porous dielectric  detector 
is more than the anode wires (strip) separation b, then N(c) ≈ N(I) = N(II) and parameter Ss  ≈ 1, (the 
detector’s spatial resolution is worse  than b). 

The detectors were held at room temperature T and the vacuum was ≈ 7 × 10-3 Torr. During time 
stability  studies  the  detectors  were  usually  switched  off  for  16  hours  every  day  and  always  at 
weekends. In all cases measurements errors are only statistical and are not indicated in figures. When 
irradiation was stopped, the counting rates were ≈ 0.1- 0.2 s-1.

6. Results of Investigation.  

Observation of the shape of amplified pulses with 500 MHz oscilloscope have shown that the rise 
time, full duration and mean amplitude of pulses generated by α particles are ≈ 2.5 ns  and ≈ 7.5 ns 
about 70 mV respectively.  

The characteristics of the detectors used and the conditions of the experiment, such as the effective 
area of the detector A, pitch b, the distance d between a radiation source and detector, the thickness L 
of porous layers just after the deposition, the intensity I of a particles entering  the porous layer, the 
temperature T at which the detector was kept after preparation and the purity of the CsI layer are given

Investigations  have  shown,  that  for  some  time  after  being  manufactured  a  porous  CsI  detector 
performance is not stable and it has poor spatial resolution. However, after being kept in vacuum for a 
certain  time  they  perform  stably  and  have  good  spatial  resolution.  The  characteristics  of  MWPDD

which are demonstrated in figure 6. 

One can see that: 1) Nα(I) and Nα(II) sharply rise with voltage and then plateau. This is because 
the  secondary  emission  factor  σ  is  directly  related  to  the  electric  field  E;  2)  within  the  experimental 
errors always Nα(I) ≈ Nα(II). This is normal because, as both groups of anode wires are identical and 

 
 

 

8

are located symmetrically with respect to the  α-source; 3) Nα(c) ≈ Nα(I) ≈ Nα(II), all α-particles are 
detected simultaneously by both groups of anode wires, i.e. detector’s spatial resolution at that time is 
worse  than  the  anode-wire  spacing  b  =  250  µm;  4)  4)  the  total  detection  efficiency  of  α-particles 
η(s+c)=  η(s)  +  η(c)    is  ≈  0.96%  (Nα(I)  ≈  Nα(II)  ≈  Nα(0)  =2562min-1).  Investigations  of  the  time 
stability  of  Nα(I),  Nα(II)  and  Nα(c)  made  just  after  these  measurements  were  finished  show  that  the 
detector’s performance at the time was unstable. The corresponding results are shown in fig.7.  

Right  after  the  completion  of  these  measurements,  Nα(I),  Nα(II)  and  Nα(c)  were  again 
investigated and it was found that  the counting characteristics of the detector improved dramatically 
but with a higher voltage required.  Results of the variation with the anode voltage U of Nα(I), Nα(II), 
Nα(c) and the total number of registered α-particles Nα(s+c) are presented in fig.8.

Fig. 8  The variation with the MWPDD anode voltage U of the numbers of α – particles detected by first group anode wires 
Nα(I), by second group wires Nα(II), by both wires groups simultaneously Nα(c) and the total number of registered α – 
particles Nα = Nα(s) + Nα(c) obtained just after observation of results given in figure 7. 

 
One can see that in this case also Nα(I) ≈ Nα(II), but Nα(c) is very small (Ss << 1), i.e. during 7 
hours of operation the width of the electron shower in the porous dielectric detector became less  that 
the  pitch  b  =  250  µm,  and  spatial  resolution  of  this  detector  became  not  worse  than  b  =  250  µm. 
Comparing  these  results  with  results  of  fig.6  we  see  that  in  fig.  8:  a)  the  dependences  of  Nα(I)  and 
Nα(II) on U are shifted by 125 V to the right, b) both Nα(I) and Nα(II) are half those in fig.6. The first 
result can possibly be explained by the increase of the porous CsI layer density with time (see fig. 5), 
since  that  brings  to  a  decrease  of  the  sizes  of  pores  and  higher  voltage  U  is  needed  to  accelerate 
electrons up to the energy required for multiplication. The second result is due to the fact, that in the 
case of the fig.6 each group of anode wires registered all incident particles, while in the case of fig.8 
each group of anode wires registered about half of these particles.  From fig.8 one can also see, that in 
the  range  of  U  >  800V  N(c)  increases.  The  reason  for  that  is  clear  because,  as  was  shown 
experimentally  [5],  the  SEE  gain  and  the  energy  of  shower  electrons  increases  with  an  electric field 
strength (see fig.1), hence the share of shower electrons reaching adjacent wires simultaneously also 
grows. The time stability investigations made after completion of these measurements have shown that 
during the experiment the detector’s performance was stable, detection efficiency was near 100 % and 
always Nα(c) was about 8 % of Nα(s+c).  

The reason why one hour after the manufacture of a porous CsI PDD, the performance is non-
stable and has poor spatial resolution is probably connected with the fact, that just after preparation by 
evaporation,  the  porous  CsI  layer  has  a  high  density  of  bulk  and  surface  defects.  These  defects  are 
charge-carrier  trapping  centers,  which  capture  the  electrons  and  holes  produced  by  the  incident 
radiation,  thus  forming  high  space  and  surface  charges,  which  polarize  the  dielectric  medium.  The 
fields of these charges weaken and destroy the external electric field in PDD and as a result suppress 
the  effectiveness  of  the  EDM,  widen  the  transversal  sizes  of  the  electron  shower  and  deteriorate  the 
spatial resolution of the detector.  
 

9

The  acquisition  by  MWPDD  of  spatial  sensitivity  and  time  stability  probably  can  be  explained 
within above described framework  by a considerable decrease of  densities of bulk and surface defects 
in porous medium.

This  investigation  shows  that  after  being  kept  in  vacuum  for  a  certain  time  after  assembly,  a 
MWPDD  performs  stably  and  has  good  spatial  resolution  even  if  it  was  not  switched  on.  For  this 
problem the detector was switched on 14 hours after assembly. Figure 9 shows U dependences of total 
detection efficiency of α - particles η(s+c) = η(s) + η(c) and, the efficiency of simultaneous detection 
of α - particle by two group of anode wires ηα(c).

assembly. The detector after assembly was kept in vacuum at temperature 180C. 

Fig. 10 The time stability of total detection efficiency of α - particles ηα(s + c) = ηα(s) + ηα(c) and the efficiency of 
simultaneous detection by the both groups of anode wires ηα(c) of MWPDD for 4.5 hours operation. These results were 
obtained just after observation of date illustrated in figure 9. 

We  see  that  always  ηα(c)  «  ηα(s+c)  and  in  a  region  of  plateau  Ss  ≈  0.1,  i.e.  after  14  hours  of  rest 
detector’s spatial resolution became better than b = 250 µm. From fig.9 and fig.8 we can notice, that 
the  curves  η(s+c)  =  f(U)  and  ηα(c)  =  f(U)  in  fig.9  are  shifted  to  the  right  by  approximately  500V 
compared with those in fig. 8. This effect is due to the thickness of the porous layer L of this MWPDD 
being  larger  than  in  the  previous  case.  After  assembly  of  the  MWPDD,  the  porous  layer  was 
compressed by about 1.5 times more than in the case of L = 0.8 mm. Therefore the sizes of the pores 
are smaller than in the previous detector and a higher voltage U is needed to accelerate electrons to the 
energy  required  for  multiplication.  Afterwards,  the  detector  operated  stably  and  maintained  good 
coordinate resolution. The results of the time stability study for 4.5 hours are shown in fig.10. These 
results  indicate  that  the  stabilization  processes  occur  when  after  preparation  MWPDD  is  kept  in 
vacuum in an idle state.

To  determine  the  transverse  size  of  an  electron  avalanche  more  precisely  than  in  the  previous 
experiment, a MWPDD with anode wire spacing b = 125µm and dimension across the wires 1cm (to 
diminish the parallax) was prepared. 14 hours after preparation, the results Ss =ηα(c)/ηα(s+c) ≈ 0.06 
and  maximum  ηα(s+c)  ≈  0.9  were  obtained.  Thus  the  transverse  size  of  electron  avalanche  in  this 
MWPDD is much smaller than 125µm. This result is very important since it means that it is possible 
to expect that detectors with smaller pitch may have better coordinate resolutions than 125µm.

 To  develop  a  theory  of  the  EDM  in  PD  under  the  action  of  the  external  electric  field  it  is  very 
important  to  know,  what  spatial  sensitivity  the  detector  has  right  after  assembly.  For  this,  it  is 
necessary  to  use  a  MWPDD  with  a  b  of  the  same  magnitude  as  the  avalanche  size.  In  this  case 
investigations of the spatial resolution of the MWPDD were carried out with pitch b = 750 µm. As in 
the  first  experiment,  measurements  have  started  in  one  hour  after  assembling  of  the  detector.  The 
investigations have shown that ηα(s+c) and Ss were 100% and 0.6 respectively, i.e. in one hour after 
assembly porous detector had quite poor spatial resolution. As was expected, on the second day it had   
Ss≈0 and operated stably.

  For  the  development  of  the  theory  of  the  EDM  in  PD  it  is  also  very  important  to  know  the 
dependence  of  stabilization  time  on  the  conditions  of  the  experiment,  such  as  the  temperature  T  at 
which  the  porous  detector  was  kept  after  assembly.  It  was  shown,  that  for  tested  detectors  the 
stabilization  time  depends  on  the  temperature  T.  Studies  were  carried  out  at  different  values  of  T, 
however  results  of  only  T=310C  are  presented.  The  dependences  of  alpha  particle  detection 
efficiencies  ηα  (s+c)  and  ηα(c)  on  U  in  one  hour  after  porous  CsI  layer  deposition  are  illustrated  in 
fig.11.  As  is  visible  from this figure, as distinct  from the results presented in  fig.6, which were also 
obtained in one hour after assembly, but at T=180C, in the   case  of  T=310C  one  hour  is  enough  for 
acquisition  by  MWPDD  of  good  spatial  sensitivity.  Thus  processes  bringing  to  a  stabilization  of 
MWPDD properties are accelerating with the increase of temperature T at which the porous detector 
was kept after assembly.

All previous detectors have been studied at very low intensities of the incident particles and had CsI 
with purity 99.99. Since polarization effects should increase with the increase of the beam intensity, 
CsI with purity 99.999 was used for research of the detector at α –particles intensity I = 711cm-2 s-1. 
The  reason  was  that  polarization  phenomena  are  influenced  by  the  cleanliness  of  the  medium.  The 
measurements started one hour after the assembly of the detector. At the beginning again as with lower 
intensities,  the  detector  had  poor  spatial  resolution,  however  in  few  hours  the  spatial  resolution 
improved, Ss fell down to Ss = 0.13 and detector starts to operate stably. The results of time stability 
measurements of ηα(s+c) and ηα(c) are presented in fig.12.

Fig. 12 The time stability of total detection efficiency of α – particles ηα(s + c) = ηα(s) + ηα(c) and the efficiency of 

simultaneous detection by the both groups of anode wires ηα(c) of MWPDD obtained for rate I = 711cm-2 s-1. The detector 
after assembly was kept in vacuum at temperature 240C. 

Note that MWPDD was switched off at nights and during weekends. One can clearly see that with 
high accuracy both ηα(s+c) and ηα(c) have constant values during 30 days, and ηα(c)/ηα ≈ 0.3, but on 
the  31-st  day  the  ηα  decreases  slightly  and  then  again  remains  constant.  A  higher  value  of  Ss  =  ηα 
(c)/ηα compared with those of other detectors is not a consequences of the transverse size of electron 
shower in porous layer, but is due to a small distance from detector to alpha particle source and large 

 

12

area of α – source (≈ 0.8cm), and accordingly a larger parallax. Note, that the reason for the decrease 
of ηα(s+c) after thirtieth day is not clear to us.  

Thus, one can conclude in two days after assembling MWPDD operates at intensity 711cm-2 s-1 of 

heavily ionizing α –particles   as good as at lower rates.

All  above  presented  results  were  obtained  for  MWPDDs  having  a  small  effective  area.  Such 
detectors  are  not  suitable  for  using  in  real  experiments.  Those  investigations  aimed  to  establish  the 
peculiarities of the porous detectors.  An area of 25 cm2 is also not large enough, but it is suitable as a 
building  block  of  a  large  area  detectors  system.    Reassuring  is  that  although  the  working  area  of 
studied  detector  is  4  times  larger  that  in  previous  cases,  its  spatial  resolution  is  as  good  and  it 
performance  is  as  stable  as  those  of  small  area  detectors.  Figure  13  shows  the  time  stability  of  the 
alpha particle detection efficiencies ηα(s+c) and and ηα(c) over a period of 3-42 days.

Fig. 13 The time stability of total detection efficiency of α - particles ηα(s + c) = ηα(s) + ηα(c) and the efficiency of 

simultaneous detection by the both groups of anode wires ηα(c) of MWPDD with area 5x5 cm2 obtained over a period of 3-
42 days operation. 
 

On  the  third  and  forth  days  this  detector  operated  continuously,  while  on  remaining  days  it  was 
switched off at nights and during weekends. One can clearly see that ηα(s+c) increased slowly during 
first six days and then  had a constant values of ηα = 0.95 and ηα(c) = 0.3 (Ss = 0.32).  

The  higher  value  of  Ss  for  this  detector  as  compared  with  those  of  previous  detectors  can  be 
explained  by  the  fact  that  effective  area  of  this  detector  is  larger  than  in  former  detectors  and 
consequently the parallax is larger (about 40µm).

The energy released by X- quanta in a porous CsI layer is compatible with energy losses of minimum 
ionizing particles in this layer, thus these results are indicative of using a MWPDD for the registration 
of minimum ionizing particles.. As in the case of α-particles, X-rays at the beginning had poor spatial 
resolution and bad stability, but day by day, the counting characteristics improved. 16 hours after the 

 
 

 

13

preparation of the MWPDD, X-ray detection efficiency ηx(s+c) rose and then plateaued at 47 %, while 
ηx(c) was very small (Ss << 1) and did not grow noticeably (fig.14). At that time, the spatial resolution 
of the detector was not worse than the anode-wire spacing b = 250 µm.

The time-stability measurements of this detector started on the second day after the MWPDD 

assembly and lasted for 29 days. During the first 18 days the detector was detecting X-rays, then from 
the 19th to 28th days it detected α-particles, and on the last (29th day) it again detected X-rays. In all 
cases its performance was good. The results obtained for detector’s operation for 3.6 hours on the 
second day at U = 1475V, for 12 hours on 16-th day at U= 1550V and for 12 hours on 18-th day at 
U=1682V are demonstrated in fig.15. One can see, that on the second and 16-th days at the beginning 
ηx(s+c) ≈ 0.5, however on the second day ηx(s+c) drops in the course of time, while on 16th day it is 
practically constant. However on the 18-th day, when the voltage was higher, the ηx(s+c) increases to 
≈ 0.7 and then within the experimental errors doesn’t change. Given that in the detector used, the CsI 
layer absorbs only ≈70% of incident X-rays, the MWPDD’s detection efficiency of absorbed X- rays 
can in principle reach 96%.

Investigations are made just after finishing the measurements results of which are demonstrated in figure 16. 
 
on the fourth and thirty second days of operation. We see that on both days ηα(s+c) rises very sharply 
and then plateaus. The voltage corresponding to a plateau on  the thirty second day is ≈100 V higher 
than that on the fourth day, but in the region of plateau detection efficiencies are the same and for both 
days  Ss  ≈  0.1.  Thus  the  spatial  resolution  of  the  MSPDD  operation  on  the  forth  and  on  the  thirty 
second  day  after  assembly  the  width  of  the  electron shower in the porous layer of MSPDD is much 
smaller than the pitch b = 100 µm and its spatial resolution is equal to 100 µm. The results on the time 
stability measurements on the 4-th and on the 32-nd days are given in fig.17. We see, that the stability 
on the 32-nd day is significantly better than on the fourth day, i.e. the stability of the detector improves 
during operation.  

Unfortunately, we could not detect X-rays by this MSPDD, because the breakdowns between the 
grid cathode and strips did not allow applying a higher voltage necessary for the detection of X-rays. 
The  aluminized  Mylar  cathode  was  also  tested.  Although  it  provided  high  homogeneity  of  electric 
field near the cathode, but our investigations showed that the MSPDD with aluminized Mylar cathode 
dose not provide a good X- ray detection efficiencies in DC mode operation and the perform unstable.  

 
Discussion. 
  
It was found experimentally that porous multiwire and microstrip detectors immediately after the 
thermal  deposition  of  the  CsI  layers  1.  operate  unstably    and  have  very  poor    spatial  sensitivity,    2. 
after being kept in vacuum for a certain time  acquire high stability and good spatial resolution, 3. after 
acquisition of these properties characteristics of detectors do not change.  It is possible to explain the 
first and second effects as follows: just after preparation a porous CsI layer crystallization processes in 
the pore walls are not completed and high densities of bulk and surface defects exist in them. These 
defects  are  charge-carrier  trapping  centers  and  form  high  space  and  surface  charges,  i.e.  dielectric 
media  is  polarized.  The  polarization  fields  changes  make  the  resulting  electric  field  weaker  and  not 
directed to the wires (strips).  These effects suppress the process of electron drift and multiplication, 
widen the electron shower and thus deteriorate the spatial resolution of the detector. The second effect 
can be explained by assuming that the crystalline structure of the pore walls spontaneously improves, 

 

15

which  results  in  a  decrease  of  the  densities  of  defects  and  accordingly  to  a  fall  of  the  degree  of 
dielectric  media  polarization.  The  third  effect  is  clearer,  since  after  completion  of  crystallization 
processes the crystalline structure does not change. This assumption is in agreement with the fact, that 
the time of the improvement of characteristic of the detector doesn’t depend on whether it is on or off, 
and  depends  only  on  the  temperature  of  the  chamber  in  which  porous  detector  is  placed  after 
assembling.  

Note,  that  in  used  detectors  α  particle  produces  7⋅104  electron-hole  pairs,  while  X-quanta 
produce only 3⋅102 [62].  Since the registration threshold was the same in  both cases, this means that 
in our experiments the detectors gain for heavily ionising particles is much less than that for weakly 
ionising particles. 

Unfortunately  we  didn’t  have  α-particle  sources  with  rate  higher  than  I  =  711cm-2s-1  and 
understand  that  this  rate  is  significantly  lower  than  fluxes  of  particles  in  modern  experiments.  It  is 
possible that for normal operation of porous detectors at higher intensities of incident particles if will 
be  necessary  to  use  cleaner  active  materials  than  those  used  in  this  work  (semiconductor  detectors 
have a purity up to of ∼ 10-10). The fact that MWPDD has good coordinate resolution, operates stably 
for 5 MeV α –particles at a flux of 700 cm-2 s-1 and registers 5.9 keV X-rays  with sufficiently high 
effectiveness  leads  us  to  believe  that  such  detectors    can  also  be  used  to  detect  minimum  ionizing  
particles  with  higher fluxes. 

Note  that  after  completing  all  of  the  measurements,  the  detectors  were  disassembled,  and  the 
surfaces  of  porous  CsI  were  investigated  with  an  optical  microscope.  No  changes  in  the  state  of  the 
CsI porous layer were observed i.e. the detectors could be still operable. 
  
Conclusions. 

    We now can conclude that multiwire and microstrip porous dielectric detectors operated in the 
DC mode perform stably and the width of the electron shower in these detectors is much smaller than 
125µm  and  100  µm  respectively.  These  results  mean,  that  detectors  with  smaller  pitch  may  have 
coordinate  resolutions  better  than  100µm.  Some  stability  and  spatial  resolution  problems  due  to 
polarization of the porous material are encountered from the very beginning, however they disappears 
in due time after assembly of porous detectors. The time of such changes of porous detector properties 
depends  on  the  temperature  at  which  it  is  held  after  assembly.  Then,  after  stabilization  of  porous 
detectors, their properties do not change independent on whether they perform or not.  

It is necessary to note that the available experimental data are insufficient for a final quantitative 
interpretation of the discovered effect and it is necessary to perform more thorough experimental and 
theoretical studies. We hope that after publishing this article the interest to that problem will increase 
and others groups will also start to study these detectors.

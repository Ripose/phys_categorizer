Abstract-  Static  charge  in  and  on  the  surface  of  pyroelectric  crystals  of 
LiNbO3 and LiTaO3 in a dilute gas has been shown to ionize gas molecules 
via  electron  tunneling.    The  released  electrons  and  positive  ions  are 
focused and accelerated according to the sign of the static uncompensated 
charge. The uncompensated charge is produced when the temperature of 
the crystal is changed from any initial temperature between about 500K 
and  about  15K.    It  may  be  either  polarization  charge  that  is  inside  the 
crystal  surface  or  compensation  charge  that  is  on  the  surface.  The 
direction of temperature change and the polarity of the base of the crystal 
determine  whether  electrons  or  positive  ions  are  accelerated  toward  or 
away  from  the  crystal.  The  ionization,  focusing  and  acceleration  may 
continue for more than 15 days following a single change in temperature 
from ~20 oC to ~160 oC to ~20 oC.   

I.  INTRODUCTION  

Twenty-three  centuries  ago  the  Greek  philosopher,  Theophrastus,  described 
what  is  now  call  the  "pryoelectric  effect".  He  described  how  the  mineral 
tourmaline had the power to attract objects  such as straw, wood, copper and 
iron [1]. The phenomenon that allowed tourmaline to attract these materials is 
the spontaneous change in polarization in tourmaline in response to changes in 
temperature in either direction, of the mineral. We now know that tourmaline

belongs  to  a  large  class  of  materials  (often  crystals)  call  pyroelectrics,  these 
are  materials  that  spontaneously  polarize  when  their  temperatures  fall  below 
their  Curie  temperatures.  They  remain  polarized  as  long  as  they  are  in  an 
environment where the temperature is below their Curie point [2, 3]. However, 
manifestation of polarization by the presence of electric charge at the surface 
is  usually  masked  by  the  collection  of  compensating  charge  from  the 
environment, if the  material remains at a stable temperature for a short time. 
That  is  why  Theophrastus  had  to  change  the  temperature  of  tourmaline  in 
some manner to cause it attract other objects. 
   It was not until 1756 that Franz Ulrich Theodor Aepinus undertook the first 
scientific  study  of  the  phenomenon.  He  found  among  other  things  that 
tourmaline  would become electrically charged  when  heated and that one end 
would  always  be  negative  on  rising  temperature  and  the  other  would  be 
positive. He also observed that this was due to the internal structure [1]. This 
was a key observation. However, how the internal structure caused charge to 
appear  at  the  surface  of  pyroelectric  crystals  remained  a  mystery  until  the 
crystallographic  structure  of  lithium  tantalate  (LiTaO3)  was  determined  in 
1972  by  Abrahams  et  al  [2].  In  1985  Weis  and  Gaylord  [3]  summarized  the 
physical properties and crystal structure of lithium niobate (LiNbO3) to show 
that it is the movement of the Li and Nb atoms with respect to the O atoms in 
lithium  niobate  that  causes  the  polarization  to  change  with  temperature.    In 
lithium  tantalate  it  is  the  movement  of  the  Li  and  Ta  atoms  that  cause  the 
polarization  to  change  with  temperature.  It  is  assumed  that  a  similar  process 
occurs in the mineral tourmaline. 
   Now,  more  than  twenty-three  centuries  after  Theophrastus  we  are  still 
observing  new  phenomena  associated  with  changing  the  temperature  of 
pyroelectric crystals [4–9].   

II.  STATIC CHARGE 

By  static  charge  we  mean  charge  that  will  linger  in  or  on  the  surface  of  a 
crystal for up to 15 days. Following in the traditions of the ancient Greeks we 
simply  change  the  temperature  of  a  pyroelectric  crystal  of  lithium  niobate 
(LiNbO3) or lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) instead of tourmaline to produce static 
charge  in  and  on  the  surface  of  these  crystals.  To  ensure  that  the  charge  is 
stable  and  long  lasting  we  carefully  control  the  environment,  the  rate  of 
change in temperature and the range over which the temperature is changed. In 
Fig.  1  we  show  a  LiNbO3  crystal  attached  to  a  heater  in  a  vacuum  chamber. 
The heater is a 62–ohm resistor and is used to change the temperature of the 
crystal.  The  vacuum  chamber  is  used  to  control  the  environment  around  the 
crystal.  By  controlling  the  environment  (gas  pressure)  we  control  the 
availability of compensating charge.

In  an  environment  of  room  air  at  1  atm  charge  from  the  air  surrounding  the 
crystal  will  compensate  or  neutralize  the  polarization  and  surface  charge 
almost as fast as it is produced and at the end of a temperature change the net 
charge  on  the  surface  of  the  crystal  will  be  zero.    In  Fig.  2(a)  we  show 
schematically  an  idealized  version  of  how  we  arrive  at  a  state  of  "static 
charge"  as  defined  above  in/on  the  surface  of  a  crystal.  We  began  at  a 
temperature T1 in Fig. 2(a) where all polarization charge inside the crystal is 
compensated  for  by  charge  of  opposite  sign  attracted  to  the  surface  of  the 
crystal. As the temperature of the crystal is raised from T1 through T2 towards 
T3 the internal polarization charge is reduced at a rate proportional to the rate 
of  change  in  temperature  and  the  pyroelectric  coefficient  of  the  crystal.  This 
leaves uncompensated external charge on the outer surface that builds up at the 
same  rate  that  polarization  charge  is  reducing.  This  external  charge  may  be 
physically removed in one discharge if it builds up too fast or in most cases it 
is neutralized via ionization of residual gas molecules in the vacuum chamber. 
The rate of ionization is pressure dependent. When the temperature is returned 
to T1' which is approximately equal to the original temperature T1, there will 
be  a  large  uncompensated  polarization  charge  at  the  internal  surface  of  the 
crystal. This is the "static charge" that will best focus and accelerate electrons 
and  positive  ions.  The  "static  charge"  that  is  produced  on  rising  temperature 
will also focus and accelerate ions and electrons but it is not as stable because 
it can be easily dislodged 
 

III.   SELF–FOCUSING 
Self-focusing of positive ions and electrons into beams [4] are two of several 
phenomena observed when the temperature of a crystal of LiNbO3 or LiTaO3 
is cycled through ~100 oC in a dilute gas environment. The exact magnitude of 
the temperature change is not important. The crystal must be cut perpendicular 
to its threefold rotationally symmetric z-axis. In Fig. 2b we show a schematic 
cartoon (a snapshot in time)  of the behavior of positive ions and electrons at 
two temperatures, T2 and T2' as the crystal is cycled from ~20 oC to ~120 oC 
to ~20  oC.  On rising temperature, at the -z base positive ions are accelerated 
away  from  the  crystal  in  a  focused  beam  and  simultaneously  electrons  are 
accelerated to it in a focused beam striking near its center (see Fig 3b). When 
the  crystal  is  cooling  the  process  is  reversed  as  shown  schematically  in  Fig. 
2(b) at T2'. The surface of the crystal was covered with a thin layer of ZnS. (c) 
Shows electron beam image when electron are accelerate away from a LiTaO3 
crystal and strike a ZnS screen. 
   If both ends were exposed these four processes would occur simultaneously.  
When electrons strike the crystal they cause the production of K x rays of Nb 
when the crystal is LiNbO3 and L x rays of Ta when the crystal is LiTaO3 [5]. 
In  Fig.  3(a)  we  present  a  photograph  (snapshot)  showing  the  crystal.  We 
imaged the spot where electrons struck the crystal by covering the surface of 
the crystal with a thin layer of ZnS in a clear lacquer.  Zinc and S K x rays are 
produced when the spot is visible.  The system is symmetric and we see the

reverse  of  this  process  on  cooling.  In  Fig.  3(c)  we  show  the  evidence  of 
electrons  accelerated  away  from  the  crystal  in  a  focused  beam.  By  placing  a 
ZnS screen (see Fig. 1) at the focal length of the crystal we were able to image 
the  beam  spot  [4,  6].  We  have  not  observed  the  four  events  simultaneously 
because  the  experimental  arrangements  that  we  use  require  that  we  heat  the 

 

5 

 

6 

crystals from one end and observe the other. However, we are able to observe 
simultaneously two events at each end of the crystal during separate runs. 
   We have  not been able to image the positive ion beam.  However,  we have 
measured some of its characteristics  with the surface barrier detector and slit 
that was used to scan the beam. Details of electron beam characterization can 
be  found  in  references  [4,  6–9].  In  brief,  we  scanned  across  the  positive  ion 
beam  at  various  distances  from  the  crystal  with  the  electron  detector  and 
determined  that  ions  accelerated  away  from  the  +z  base  on  cooling  were 
focused  to  a  spot  some  distance  away  from  the  crystal.  It  is  assumed  that 
positive  ions  accelerated  to  the  crystal  are  also  focused  to  a  spot  near  the 
center of the crystal. 
   We believe that positive ions and electrons are focused because the electric 
field lines near the crystal surface are slightly inclined toward the z-axis due to 
the higher electric field at the edge of the crystal relative to that at the center.  

IV.    SOURCE OF POSITIVE IONS AND ELECTRONS 

The source of positive ions and electrons that makes up these beams is the 
dilute gas in the vacuum chamber. Because of the static charge in and/or on 
the surface of the crystal, there is a very strong electric field at the surface of 
the crystal (|E0| = 1.35x107 V/cm) [10]. Thus, when gas molecules randomly 
approach the exposed surface of the crystal they are ionized via electron 
tunneling, thus producing an ion pair. One specie is accelerated away and the 
other towards the crystal. They are both focused by the same electric field that 
caused their production.  The species that is accelerated to the crystal 
compensates or neutralizes static charge on or in the surface of the crystal. 
This causes a reduction in the field strength of the electric field. Over time the 
strength of the electric field will be reduced to below the threshold for ion pair 
production. The pressure in the vacuum chamber determines the time it takes 
for the electric field to fall below the threshold for ion pair production. At 
pressures < 10-6 Torr we have observed ion pair production for 15 days 
following one temperature cycle [9]. 
 

V.  BEAM TRANSPORT 
Positive ion and electron beams have been transported through small diameter 
metal and plastic tubes ranging in length from 21.5mm to118mm with inside 
diameters from 0.25mm to 0.75mm. The tubes were both straight and inclined 
with the beams, or slightly curved with the entrance in line with the beam, or 
straight  and  at  a  slight  angle  to  the  beam  or  the  beams  focal  spot  was  offset 
from  the  entry  to  a  straight  tube.  In  each  case  the  tubes  opening  was  at  the 
focal  length  [4].  In  Fig.  4  we  show  schematic  drawings  of  two  of  the  tube 
arrangements  described  above.  In  Fig.  5  we  show  a  positive  ion  and  three 
electron spectra collected using the arrangement shown in Fig. 4a. Figure 5a is 
the positive ion spectrum collected during the 156 sec. warm-up. Figures 5b-d

shows  electron  spectra  collected  as  snapshots  as  the  crystal  cools  in  three 
different  pressure  environments.    Notice  that  the  energy  of  the  first  peak 
increases  with  increasing  pressure  a  phenomenon  we  call  gas  amplification. 
Gas  amplification  and  the  multi-peaks  are  discussed  in  detail  in  references  7 
and  8.The  electron  spectra  which  show  peaks  at  energy  E,  2E,  3E…  arise 
because when the exposed crystal surface is negative positive ions bombard it 
and eject several electrons in one collision due to Auger electron emission and 
secondary  electrons.    These  electrons  are  focused  and  arrive  at  the  detector 
within its resolving time.  Thus there are no electrons of energy 2E, 3E …Here 
we point out that transport of the electron beam through metal or plastic tubes 
does not impede these processes when the tube is straight. On the other hand 
as shown in Fig. 6 when the electron beam passes through the curved tube as 
shown in Fig. 4(b) the multi-peak information is lost. However, gas

amplification  and  count  rate  increase  with  pressure  is  still  evident.  The 
electron  count  rate  increase  is  due  to  increased  available  gas  molecules  for 
ionization during each 10 sec. counting interval.    
  We have used several techniques to try and increase our understanding of the 
nature of the focusing process and the characteristic of the electron beam and 
its  dependence  on  the  environment  around  the  focal  spot.  The  arrangement 
shown  in  Fig.  4(c)  was  used  to  determine  if  focusing  would  be  disturbed  or 
distorted by placing a small object at or near the focal spot. A metal tube with 
an  inside  diameter  of  0.75  mm  was  used.  The  tube  could  be  grounded  and 
ungrounded during experiments.  No effect was observed.

Evidence  that  the  tube  does  not  appear  to  affect  the  focusing  is  presented  in

results. 
   High-count rates with multiple peaks were observed when the opening was 
at  the  focal  spot  and  low  counting  rate  when  it  was  moved  away.  Moving  it 
several more mm resulted in no counts.

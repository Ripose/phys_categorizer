Abstract 

We  propose  a  new  class  of  one-dimensional  (1D)  photonic  waveguides:  the  fractal 

photonic  crystal  waveguides  (FPCWs).  These  structures  are  photonic  crystal  waveguides 

(PCWs)  etched  with  fratal  distribution  of  grooves  such  as  Cantor  bars.  The  transmission 

properties  of  the  FPCWs  are  investigated  and  compared  with  those  of  the  conventional  1D 

PCWs.  It  is  shown  that  the  FPCW  transmission  spectrum  has  self-similarity  properties 

associated  with  the  fractal  distribution  of  grooves.  Furthermore,  FPCWs  exhibit  sharp 

localized transmissions peaks that are approximately equidistant inside the photonic band gap.

1. Introduction 

In  recent  years  the  study  of  fractals  has  attracted  the  attention  of  researchers, 

encouraged  by  the  fact  that  many  physical  phenomena,  natural  structures  and  statistical 

processes can be analyzed and described by using a fractal approach [1]. From a mathematical 

point of view the concept of fractal is associated with a geometrical object which 1) is self-

similar  (i.e.,  the  object  is  exactly  or  approximately  similar  to  a  part  of  itself)  and,  2)  has  a 

fractional  (or  noninteger)  dimension.  Self-similar  structures  are  obtained  by  performing  a 

basic operation, called generator, on a given geometrical object called initiator, and repeating 

this process on multiple levels, in each one of them an object composed of sub-units of itself 

is  created  that  resembles  the  structure  of  the  whole  object.  Mathematically,  this  property 

should hold on all (infinite) scales. However, in the real world, there are necessarily lower and 

upper bounds over which such self-similar behaviour applies. 

In  optics,  fractal  structures,  ranging  from  simple  one-dimensional  (1D)  objects  [2]  to 

complex  2D  systems  [3-5]  have  been  extensively  studied.  Specifically,  1D  dielectric 

multilayers  characterized  by  a  refractive-index  distribution  that  follows  Cantor  [6,7] 

sequences have been analyzed. The fractal profile of these structures leads to a transmission 

spectrum with self-scaling properties [8], i.e., the variation of the spectrum with the frequency 

at each higher stage is a modulated version of that associated with the previous step with an 

appropriate scaling of the frequency range [9,10]. Moreover, as a consequence of this fractal 

property, these structures exhibit a certain number of transmission peaks inside the frequency 

band  gap.  The  same  phenomenon  arises  in  corrugated  waveguides,  which  film  thickness 

follows  a  Cantor  distribution.  These  systems  have  been  analyzed  using  a  transmission  lines 

method based on an equivalent 1D multilayer of effective indices [11]. 

In this work we present a novel family of fractal photonic crystal waveguides (FPCWs) 

with interesting fractal properties. These systems can be generated by etching a set of grooves 

 

2

in a slab waveguide according with a self-similar distribution. Although there is a great deal 

of  interest  in  the  properties  of  conventional  PCWs  [12]  to  control  the  emission  and 

propagation  of  light  [13],  to  our  knowledge,  self-similar  distributions  of  grooves  in  PCWs 

have not been studied in the literature. To analyze these systems we will employ a rigorous 

and  efficient  technique  for  modeling  dielectric  systems  with  an  arbitrary  refractive  index 

distribution [14], since the transmission properties of 1D periodic PCW or FPCWs may differ 

substantially from those of ideal 1D systems. 

To  analyze  a  FPCW  we  will  consider  this  system  as  a  conventional  PCW  with  a 

periodic  lattice  of  grooves  where  the  separation  between  specific  grooves  is  increased.  The 

resultant structure can be interpreted as a quasi-periodic PCW, i.e., a PCW with defects. The 

insertion of defects in conventional PCWs has been used to increase the functionally of this 

systems [15,16]. 

This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we revise a conventional 1D PCW and 

we obtain the limits of the photonic band gap and the transmission spectrum of the structure. 

Next, in Section 3 we tackle the problem of the synthesis of FPCWs. We perform the analysis 

for a particular case and we compare the transmission spectrum with the conventional PCW. 

Finally,  in  Section  4  of  this  paper  the  main  results  are  outlined  and  some  applications  are 

proposed. 

 

2. Main aspects of the spectral transmission in conventional photonic crystal waveguides 

A conventional PCW is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a structured thin film of refractive 

index  ng  over  a  substrate  of  index ns, air being the cover. The film  of  thickness d is etched 

with a finite 1D lattice of grooves of period Λ and air-filling fraction f. The slab waveguide 

 

3

confines  light  in  the  vertical  direction  and  the  lattice  of  grooves  allows  to  control  the  light 

propagating along the in-plane direction. 

One  of  the  more  relevant  properties  of  photonic  crystals  is  the  possibility  to  show 

photonic  band  gaps  (PBGs),  i.e.,  certain  ranges  of  frequencies  where  light  propagation  is 

prohibited. In order to obtain the photonic band-gap limits of the periodic structure, we have 

analyzed  the  dispersion  relation  of  the  guided  Bloch  modes  of  the  system  with  an  infinite 

number of periods by using the orthonormal-basis method [17]. This technique is based on a 

modal  algorithm  that  allows  us  to  simulate  dielectric  systems  with  an  arbitrary  refractive-

index distribution. It consists in expanding the 3D wave equation for the magnetic field in a 

certain domain in terms of an auxiliary system properly chosen to provide a suitable basis. In 

the present case, the system is periodic along the propagation direction, and therefore we must 

select  periodic  boundary  conditions  in  that  direction,  and  we  impose  confining  boundary 

conditions in the direction perpendicular to the film plane. Then, for computational purposes, 

the  system  is  placed  between  two  parallel  perfectly-conducting  metallic  plates  located  far 

enough from the PCW. Accordingly, the chosen auxiliary system is a 1D homogeneous air-

filled waveguide, whose modes are well know.  

As  a  practical  example  we  considered  a  periodic  PCW  with  d  =  0.8Λ,  f  =  0.15,  ng  = 

3.37, and ns = 1.61. These refractive-index values correspond to a thin-film of GaAs over a 

substrate  of  AlxOy.  Its  TE  Brillouin  diagram  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The  upper  left  and  right 

shaded  regions  correspond  to  radiation  modes.  The  dispersion  curves  allow  to  localize  the 

PGB  between  the  normalized  frequency  (2πλ/Λ)  values  1.155  and  1.327.  In  this  frequency 

range only evanescencent modes characterized by a complex wavevector kz are solutions of 

the wave equation and, therefore, the transmission spectrum vanishes in an infinite periodic 

structure. However, when the number of periods is finite, we should match these modes and 

 

4

those  of  the  waveguides  connected  to  the  PCW  at  the  input  and  output  planes,  and, 

consequently, part of the energy may pass through the PCW. 

We have determined the PCW transmission spectrum with a finite number of periods by 

using the numerical method proposed in Ref. 14. This method allows to analyze 3D dielectric 

systems with an arbitrary refractive index distribution connected to dielectric waveguides. In 

our case, the 3D dielectric system corresponds to the central region of Fig. 1, where the air 

grooves are located, which is connected to the input and output slab waveguides. The present 

method  provides  a  linear  equation  system  relating  the  modal  coefficients  of  the  waveguide 

modes, which allow to obtain the multimode scattering matrix. These waveguide modes can 

be easily obtained with the biorthonormal-basis method [18,19].  

In Fig. 3, we present the transmission spectrum of the conventional PCW shown in Fig. 

1 for different numbers of grooves, N. We observe that the addition of grooves causes a rapid 

decrease  of  the  transmitted  power  inside  the  PBG  range.  The  minimum  of  the  normalized 

transmitted power with only 8 air grooves is 0.049. 

 

3. Self-similarity in photonic crystal waveguides 

The  main  idea  of  the  present  work  consists  in  introducing  some  defects  in  the 

conventional PCW shown in Fig. 1, such that the air grooves distribution follow a self-similar 

sequence. As a particular case we have selected the triadic Cantor sequence shown in Fig. 4. 

The first step in the construction procedure of this particular self-similar sequence consists in 

defining  a  straight-line  segment  of  length,  L,  called  the  initiator  (stage  S  =  0).  Next,  at  the 

stage S = 1 the generator of the set is constructed from N = 2 non-overlapping copies of the 

initiator,  each  with  a  scale  γ<0.5.  At  following  stages,  the  generation  processes  is  repeated 

over  and  over  again  for  each  segment  in  the  previous  stage.  At  the  Sth  stage,  the  triadic 

 

5

Cantor fractal consists of 2S segments interleaved with 2S-1 gaps, all segments having equal 

lengths:

According  with  the  above  self-similar  sequence,  at  Sth  stage,  the  proposed  FPCW 

consists of 2S air grooves etched in a slab waveguide (see in Fig. 4). Note that this system can 

be considered as a quasi-periodic PCW, i.e., a conventional PCW of period

where  a  set  of  defects  have  been  properly  introduced  by  increasing  the  distance  between

number of gaps of the previous stage, S-1, i.e., 2S-1-1. These defects are located at the ith gap 

when k > 1 in Eq. (2). The resulting FPCW is shown in Fig. 5 for S = 3.

Since  the  system  frequency  range  could  not  be  scaled,  in  order  to  show  the  self-similarity 

properties of the FPCW spectrum for different values of S, we must scale the whole structure 

leaving in each stage the air grooves with the same width a. In this case, the period of FPCW 

is  also  a  constant  magnitude,  Λ,  where  a  =  fΛ  [see  Eq.  (4)].  In  terms  of  the  structural 

parameters Λ and f, the distance between air grooves in the FPCW is given by

From Eq. (7), when k = 1 (odd values of i) the distance between air grooves coincides with 

that of a conventional PCW, (1-f)Λ. At other positions with k > 1 (even values of i), a defect 

has  been  generated  in  the  structure  increasing  the  distance  between  air  grooves  in  a  factor

Next we analyze a FPCW for different stages, S, and the structural parameters  used to 

obtain the transmission spectrum in Fig. 3 for the conventional PCW (d = 0.8Λ,  f = 0.15, ng = 

3.37, and ns = 1.61). From Eqs. (5) and (6), singlemode waveguide operation is given in the 

range comprised between the normalized frequencies 0.170 and 1.497. We focus our attention 

around the PBG shown in Fig. 2 and we will compare the spectrum of the FPCW with that of 

the  conventional  PCW  (Fig.  3).  Fig.  6  shows  the  transmission  spectrum  of  the  considered 

FPCW for stages S = 1, 2 and 3. These results have been obtained using the same numerical 

 

7

methods implemented in the previous section. We observe that the transmission spectrum of 

the  system  exhibit  a  characteristic  fractal  profile,  reproducing  the  self-similarity  of  the 

original  FPCW.  In  fact,  the  response  at  a  given  stage,  S,  is  a  modulated  version  of  that 

associated with the previous stage.  

Obviously,  when  S  =  1  the  system  is  simply  a  conventional  PCW  with  N  =  2,  so  the 

resultant transmission spectrum coincides with that obtained in Fig. 3. For S = 2, we have a 

quasi-periodic structure with 4 air grooves and a central defect located at i = 2 (k = 2). As a 

consequence,  resonant  frequencies  appears  in  the  spectrum,  at  normalized  frequency  values 

separated  approximately  0.123.  For  S  =  3,  the  resulting  quasi-periodic  structure  has  8  air 

grooves and 3 defects located at positions i = 2, 4 and 6 (k = 2, 3 and 2, respectively). New 

resonant  frequencies  arise  in  the  PBG,  characterized  by  narrower  widths.  The  distance 

between  these  frequencies  diminishes  to  about  0.016.  Deviation  of  these  values  may  be 

attributed  to  the  fact  that  FPCWs  are  dispersive  structures  since  the  effective  index  of  the 

guide mode depends on the frequency (even if the media of the slab-waveguide are not). With 

the considered air-filling fraction, f = 0.15, the scale factor of the Cantor sequence given in 

Eq. (4) is approximately 0.130. A simple evaluation of the fraction of resonance distances for 

S = 3 and S = 2 gives an identical value. This fact illustrate the self-similarity property of this 

kind of structures. 

 

4. Conclusions 

The FPCW, a new type of PCW having a self-similar structure has been introduced. The 

design  process  of  these  waveguides  is  described  and  the  expressions  for  the  construction 

parameters are derived. It is shown that a given FPCW can be understood as a conventional 

PCW  with  some  defects  introduced  in  the  lattice.  As  a  particular  example,  the  numerical 

 

8

simulation  of  a  system  generated  by  etching  a  finite  set  of  grooves  in  a  slab  waveguide 

distributed according with a triadic Cantor sequence has been proposed. The FPCW gives a 

transmission  spectrum  characterized  by  a  fractal  profile,  reproducing  the  structural  self-

similarity  of  the  originating  system.  The  transmission  spectra  of  the  FPCW  presents  sharp 

localized  resonances  approximately  equidistant  inside  the  photonic  band  gap  as  a 

consequence  of  the  fractals  properties.  These  transmission  spectra  could  be  used  to  design 

novel  polychromatic  optical  filters.  Moreover,  the  field  localization  associated  to  the  above 

resonances could be useful in designing nonlinear devices. Novel FPCW following alternative 

1D and 2D self-similar sequences are subject of continuing study.

Abstract – Einstein’s 1905 derivation of E = mc2 has been criticized for being
circular. Although such criticism have been challenged it is certainly true that the
reasoning in Einstein’s original derivation is not at all obvious. Einstein’s original
derivation could be been made clearer. This article describes a clear way of doing
so.

I - Introduction

In Einstein’s 1905 paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies 1 he derived an
expression for the relationship for the energy of light wave as observed from two
different inertial frames of reference. In another paper in the same issue the
journal Einstein’s paper Does the inertia of a body depend on its energy content?
appeared 2. In it he used the aforementioned energy relationship to derive what
has become written as E = mc2 which relating to the change in the mass of the
body due to a decrease in. His arguments were later criticized, notably by H.
Ives,  for being circular 3. However even though such criticisms have been
challenged they do demonstrate the difficulty in following Einstein’s logic. In
this paper I provide a simple derivation in the spirit of that given by Einstein but
which is much easier to understand. Einstein’s derivation was based on the
change in kinetic energy which results from a decrease in the bodies mass where

he mass is the m in 
. This relation provides a secondary meaning for
the body’s mass. By this I mean that the m, the inertial mass, is defined as the m

directly associated with the body’s inertial mass. Although this is not an
objectionable usage of the inertial mass, a more direct usage would be more
satisfactory. Especially if the proof becomes easier to follow. I present below
what I believe to be a truly intuitively obvious derivation.

II - Derivation of E = mc2 based on conservation of momentum

Consider a body at rest in an inertial frame, S, as shown above.  The body emits
two photons, a and b, of equal energy in opposite directions. The total energy of
the two photons, as measured in S, is E.  Due to the conservation of momentum,
the emitting body must remain at rest in S. It follows that the velocity must be
constant in S’. As viewed from S’ before the photons are emitted there is only a
single body, the total momentum being that of the body which is defined as

Therefore the inertial mass changes with a change in energy of the body. Since
this relation holds for all v < c it therefore holds in the limiting case of v = 0. We
can therefore identify the energy as the energy of the radiation as emitted in the
frame in which the body is at rest and interpret ∆m as a change in rest mass.

III – Conclusion

The derivation I’ve given here seems like the most obvious approach to the
equivalence of mass and energy. The spirit of the derivation is nearly identical to
Einstein’s but is more direct. Since mass is defined as being the ratio of
momentum and velocity it seems quite natural to use the principle of momentum
conservation to derive the relation. Very little is needed beyond the expression
for the energy of the light in the moving and the velocity transformation relation,
both of which are available in Einstein’s 1905 paper.  The derivation is also easy
to follow and is readily accessible to those who wish to understand Einstein’s
original derivation since it serves as step in that direction since the spirit of the
derivation is the same as Einstein’s original derivation.

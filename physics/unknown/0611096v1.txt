ABSTRACT 
Our  paper  attempts  to  generalize  a  technique  as  to  density  wave  current  calculations  to  questions  of 

instanton  formation  in  biological/  multi  dimensional  condensed  matter  systems.  We  review  prior 

calculations done through a numerical simulation that the massive Schwinger model used to formulate 

solutions  to  CDW  transport  in  itself  is  insufficient  for  transport  of  soliton-antisoliton  (S-S’)  pairs 

through  a  pinning  gap  model  of  CDW  transport.  Using  the  Peierls  condensation  energy  permits 

formation  of  CDW  S-S’  pairs  in  wave  functionals.  This  leads  us  to  conclude  that  if  there  is  a  small 

spacing between soliton-antisoliton (S-S’) charge centers, as given in a calculation so rendered, and an 

approximate fit between a tilted washboard potential and the system we are modeling, that instantons 

are pertinent to current/transport problems so presented. This technique’s generalization depends upon 

a good multi dimensional representation of a ‘gaussian’ wavefunctional, as well as an accurate model 

of  charge  distributions  which  can  be  used  to  calculate  ‘self  interaction  energy’  values  for  a  multi 

dimensional  transport  problem  setting  which  permit  the  formation  of  Gaussian  wave  functionals  for 

instanton physics being relevant in a bio – physics setting.

INTRODUCTION  
We have prior to this paper formed an argument using the integral Bogomol'nyi inequality to present 

how a soliton-anti soliton (S-S’) pair could form.1,2 In addition, we also have shown how the formation 

of  wave  functionals  is  congruent  with  Lin’s  nucleation  of  an  electron-positron  pair  as  a  sufficiency 

argument  as  to  forming  Gaussian  wave  functionals3.  We  reported  in  an  earlier  IJMPB  paper4 

compelling  reasons  as  to  how  additions  of  a  Peierls  gap  term,  in  addition  to  the  single  chain  model 

resonance  condition  permits  addition  of  a  very  large  potential  term  which  allows  for  multi  chain  / 

Josephson junction treatment as to density wave current calculations. Here, we are going to generalize 

this technique as to potentials arising in biological systems, and to speak as to necessary and sufficient 

conditions for the formation of instantons5 for certain biological system potentials which roughly have 

to  behave  similarly  as  a  tilted  washboard  potential.  In  addition  the  main  requirement  lies  in  our 

upcoming calculations as to formation of a minimum distance requirement between charge centers of a 

S-S’ pair formation used as a nucleus for a Gaussian wave functional representation of an instanton in 

current calculations. This is inversely proportional to the absolute value of a largely electro static ‘self 

energy’ value of ions, both positive and negative which interact with each other in a multi dimensional 

setting.  For  CDW,  this  numerical  calculation  is  largely  similar  to  the  huge  stored  energy  values  in 

between capacitor plates, as modeled by Dr. Miller et al in his PRL article as of 2000. Should this be 

duplicated in biological potential systems, as modeled when we have a large ‘self energy’ value , then 

the discretized grid for a Josephson junction type equation of state has small spacing, permitting the 

formation of a domain wall varying between zero to two times pi in value, which is a necessary ( but 

not always sufficient ) condition for the formation of S-S’ pairs for current calculations. 

When we modeled CDW, we found that our simulated Hamiltonian system. with a constant term 

in it is proportional to the Peierls gap times a cosine term representing interaction of different CDW 

chains  in  our  massive  Schwinger6  model.  This  change  of  the  Hamiltonian  term  is  adding  in  an 

additional  potential  energy  term  making  the  problem  look  like  a  Josephon  junction  problem.  Our 

numerical  simulation  of  the  single-chain  problem  for  CDW  involving  S-S’  pairs  gave  a  resonance 

condition in transport behavior over time,  with no barrier tunneling. The argument here that we will 

 

2

present is that the false vacuum hypothesis7 is a necessary condition for the formation of S-S’ pairs and 

that the multi-chain term we add to a massive Schwinger equation for CDW transport is a sufficiency 

condition  for  the  explicit  formation  of  a  soliton  (anti  soliton)  in  our  charge  density  wave  transport 

problem.  This,  plus  confirmation  of  a  minimum  distance  requirement  between  S-S’  charge  centers 

which would become tiny for large self energy values of the electrostatic would indicate the feasibility 

of  the  instanton  physics  approach  for  transport/  current  calculations  in  tilted  washboard  potential 

defined physical systems, not just the CDW low dimensional problem we analyze below.  . 

II.  REVIEW  OF  THE  NUMERICAL  BEHAVIOR  OF  A 
SINGLE-CHAIN  FOR  CDW  DYNAMICS.  I.E.  WHY  WE 
NEED  THE  PIERLS  GAP  TERM  ADDED  TO  OUR 
PROBLEM. 
We are modifying a one chain model of Charge Density Wave (CDW) transport initially pioneered by 

Dr.  John  Miller8  which  furthered  Dr.  John  Bardeens  work9  on  a  pinning  gap  presentation  of  CDW 

transport.  The  single-chain  model  is  a  good  way  to  introduce  how  a  threshold  electric  field  would 

initiate transport, qualitatively speaking. We did, however, when using it, assume that the CDW would 

be easily modeled with a soliton (anti soliton) Gaussian packet. So we undertook this investigation to 

determine necessary and sufficient condition to physically justify use of a soliton (anti-soliton) for our 

wave packet. We start by using an extended Schwinger model 8 with the Hamiltonian set as

We  should  note  in  writing  this  that  that  a  washboard  potential  with  small  driving  term6

  added  to  the  main  potential  term  of  the  washboard  potential,  is  used  to  model 

transport  phenomenology  .We  also  argue  that  this  potential  permits  domain  wall  modeling  of  S-S’ 

pairs.10  In  this  situation, 

Eμ   is  proportional  to  the  electrostatic  energy  between  the  S-S’  pair 

constituents (assuming a parallel plate capacitor analogy) ; Θ  is a small driving force we will explain 

later,  dependent  upon  a  ratio  of  an  applied  electric  field  over  a  threshold  field  value.  As  we  show 

later11,  the  dominant  washboard  potential  term  will  have  the  value  of  (pinning  energy)  times

  We  should  note  the  new  physics  added  here  since  in  this  situation, 

Eμ   is  proportional  to  the 

electrostatic  energy between  the  S-S’ pair  constituents  (assuming  a  parallel  plate  capacitor  analogy); 

Θ  is a small driving force It is also relevant to note that we previously found5 that topological soliton 

style arguments can explain why the potential lead to the least action integrand collapsed to primarily a 

quadratic potential contribution, which permits treating the wave functional as a Gaussian .As would 

be  expected  ,the  ratio  of  the  coefficient  of  pinning  gap  energy  of  the  Washboard  potential  used  in

To  those  whom  are  unfamiliar  with  the  Schwinger  model,  we  state  that  the  Schwinger  model  is  the 

model describing 2D Euclidean quantum electrodynamics with a Dirac fermion.. We use it, keeping in 

mind  the  instanton12  flavor  to  the  model,  as  well  as  how  instantons  can  be  analytically  conveyed  in 

transport  via  a  wave  functional  with  a  Gaussian  integrand13  and  work  with  a  quantum  mechanically

We use variants of Runge-Kutta14 in order to obtain a sufficiently large time step interval so as to be 

able to finish calculations in a reasonable period of time; this avoids an observed spectacular blow up 

of simulated average phase values; which was observed after 100 time steps at

.  The  advantage  of  this  model  is  that  it  is  second  order  accurate, 

explicit,  and  unconditionally  stable,  so  as  to  avoid  numerical  blow  up  behavior  .One  then  gets 

resonance  phenomena  as  represented  by  Fig.  1.  This  is  quite  unphysical  and  necessitates  making 

changes, which we will be presenting in this manuscript.  In particular, we observed Eq. (2.4) results in 

a run away oscillation which corresponds to a continual adding up of non dissipated energy of a S-S’ 

pair bouncing between the walls of the potential system, without tunneling commencing.  

III.  ADDITION  OF  AN  NEW  TERM  IN  THE  MASSIVE 
SCHWINGER  EQUATION  TO  PERMIT  FORMATION 
OF  A  S-S’  PAIR,  AND  ITS  LINKS  TO  FORMING 
INSTANTON PHYSICS. 
Initially we will present how addition of an interaction term between adjacent CDW chains will allow 

a soliton (anti soliton) to form due to some analytical considerations we will present here.11 Finally we 

shall  endeavor  to  show  how our  argument  with  the  interaction  term  ties  in  with  the  fate  of  the  false 

vacuum  construction  of  S-S’  terms  done  in  our  prior  publication  where  either  one  used  the 

Bogomil’nyi inequality15 as a necessary condition to the formation of S-S’ terms or used the ground 

state ansatz argument which still uses the false vacuum hypothesis extensively. Let us now first refer to 

how we can obtain a soliton via assuming that adjacent CDW terms can interact with each other.  

One of our references,1,2,3 uses the Bogomil'nyi inequality to obtain a S-S’ pair which we approximate 

how neighboring chains interrelate with one another to obtain a representation of phase evolution as an 

arctan  function  w.r.t.  space  and  time  variables.  To  whit,  either  the  false  vacuum  hypothesis  itself 

creates conditions for the necessity of a Gaussian ansatz, or else the Bogomil’nyi inequality provides 

for  the  necessity  of  a  S-S’  pair  nucleating  via  a  Gaussian  approximation  which  is  the  only  way  to 

answer data Dr. Miller collected in an experiment in 1985.16. But in our separate model presented in 

 

6

this paper we find that the interaction of neighboring chains of CDW material permits the existence of 

solitons (anti-solitons) in CDW transport due to the huge  Δ′  term added which lends to a Josephon 

junction  interpretation of  this  transport problem  in  CDW dynamics.  Note  that  in  the  argument  about 

the formation of a soliton (anti soliton), that we use a multi-chain simulation Hamiltonian with Peierls 

condensation energy used to couple adjacent chains (or transverse wave vectors) as represented by

this propagation of this soliton ‘field’ from 0 to  π⋅2

gets a linkage with the original pendulum model linked together by harmonic forces by allowing the

about  this while  using  a  momentum  space  representation  of a  soliton- anti  soliton  pair(S-S’) using a 

momentum  space  representation  of  soliton-  anti  soliton  pair(S-S’),  i.e.  via  a  Fourier  transform  in

Now how do we relate all this to the formation of Wave functional gaussians ? It so  happens that the 

Pierels  gap  magnitude  term    so  referred  to  in  the  following  argument  is  central  to  forming 

wavefunctionals,  as  will  be  seen  in  the  following  development.  For  the  Bogomol’nyi  inequality 

approach  we  modify  a  de  facto  1+1  dimensional  problem  in  condensed  matter  physics  to  being  one 

which  is  quasi  one  dimensional  by  making  the  following  substitution,  namely  looking  at  the 

Lagrangian density ς to having a time independent behavior denoted by a sudden pop up of a S-S’ 

pair via the substitution of the nucleation ‘pop up’ time by 

 is the Planck’s time interval. Then afterwards, we shall use the substitution of

IV.  FORMING  A  CRITERIA  FOR  NON  ZERO 
MINIMUM DISTANCE BETWEEN S-S’ CHARGE PAIRS 
 

Realistically, we need now to consider how to include in a calculation as to minimum distance needed 

for electro static forces needed to insure a non zero finite separation between charge centers of a S-S’ 

pair . This , in tandem with the above calculation presented with respect to forming an arc tan function 

varying  from  zero  to  two  times  pi  with  respect  to  a  phase  value  is  the  linchpin  of  how  to  form  a 

necessary , but not in itself sufficient condition for forming an instanton  in a condensed matter/ bio 

physics system 

This is from my dissertation6, as an appendix entry. We will look at the CDW case first, and then from 

there  generalize  to  different  charge  array  systems.  Quoting  that  appendix  entry:  We  start  off  with  a

V.  LOOKING  AT  MULTI  DIMENSIONAL  VERSIONS 
OF EQN. 4.10 ABOVE, AND THEIR INTERPRETATION 
We have a template for how to look at self energy of ionic charges which are in a multi dimensional 

state system. To whit, in the biological situation we can look at the following example of a potential 

system,  ie.  Looking  at  Yuri  Georgievskii’s  article18  on  transitions  from  nonadiabatic  to  adiabatic 

 

16

proton  tunneling,  we  see  that  in  figure  1  of  the  article,  we  have  for  proton  tunneling  a  near  picture 

perfect version of the tilted  washboard potential. The difference with the CDW case is that we have 

moving positive charges, rather than moving negative charges. It would be up to us to determine if or 

not  we  can  observe  a  biological  equivalence  to  stationary  negative  charges  for  the  positive  moving 

charges to interact with. If so, we can then begin the analysis of how we can form the biological redox 

reaction as mentioned in the paper along the lines of computing a soft tissue version of the interaction 

energy  given  in  Eqn.  4.10.Gerrogievskii’s  article  constructs  methodology  of  how  to  use  a  transfer 

function which uses a tunneling matrix element. We wish to restrict our analysis to if or not it is likely 

a multi dimensional version of Eqn. 4.10 actually exists, which depends upon if or not the biological 

equivalent  to  Eqn.  4.09  can  be  constructed  which  would  lead  to  ,  if  it  is  small  in  magnitude,  to 

conditions duplicating at least in an interval of time, instanton formation which could cross biological 

boundaries.

FOR  A  FIELD  THEORETICAL  TREATMENT  OF 
TUNNELING 
MULTI 
DIMENSIONAL CONDENSED MATTER  SYSTEMS. 

BIOLOGICAL/ 

FOR 

 

Essentially  for  biological  phenomena,  we  need  to  observe  if  or  not  we  have  a  large  value  of  electro 

static interaction between ions  positive and negative, leading to a small  but not zero distance between 

the charge centers seen in an electrostatic formulation of an instanton. We have in section III outlined 

the procedure as to how a wash board potential, if identified for a physical system, can with addition of 

the Peierls gap term  Δ   form a scalar field version of  an arctan function, as varying between zero to 

two pi. We will briefly  first outline the S-S’ formation behavior in CDW physics and then generalize 

it to what is needed in multi dimensional problems seen in both condensed matter and in bio physics. 

Now going to the CDW mode first … 

 

         What  occurs  in  CDW  instanton  physics  as  written  up  is  a  synthesis  of  several  methods,  plus 

additional  insight  as  to  the  topological  charge  dynamics  of  density  wave  transport  which  were 

neglected in prior attempts to analyze this problem fully. Note that the Bogomil’nyi inequality stresses

representation  of  how  S-S’  pairs  evolve  in  a  pinning  gap  transport  problem  for  charge  density  wave 

dynamics. The overall convergence of a numerical scheme to represent multi-chain contributions to the 

analysis  of  this  problem,  gives  a  Josephon  junction  flavor  to  our  analysis.  It  also  underlies  the 

formation of solitons (anti solitons) which was used by us as the underpinnings of the S-S’ pairs used 

to give more detailed structure to the field theoretic analysis of this important problem. We would like 

to  in  future  work  to  examine  the  implications  of  Sidney  Colemans  references  to  not  needing  a 

renormalization  other  than  that  needed  for  zero  point  energy  in  his  paper  ‘More  about  the  Massive 

Schwinger  model19,  but  we  do  not  think  this  will  affect  the  I-E  plots  derived  analytically  and 

referenced in this publication. 

     Having  said  that,  what  do  we  need  to  do  for  a  biological/  multi  dimensional  condensed  matter 

system?

between the adjacent n values so that something akin to Eqn. 3.6 still leads to that arctan function for 

the phase value φ we have for evolution of our physical system.; To do that, we need a comparatively 

large  potential  energy  interaction  between  positive,  and  negative  ions  as  outlined  as  contributing  to 

Eqn. 4.10 above. In addition we also need to generalize what is meant by a wave functional treatment 

of a multi dimensional Gaussian, i.e. In several dimensions, we find that the Gaussian wavefunctionals 

would be given in the form given by Lu.13 Lu’s integration given below is a two dimensional Gaussian 

wave functional. The analytical result we are working with is a one-dimensional version of a ground-

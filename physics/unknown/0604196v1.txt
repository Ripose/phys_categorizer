Abstract 

Following Axelrod’s model of cultural dissemination, formal computational studies of cultural 

influence have suggested that more possibilities of contact between geographically distant regions 

– for example due to improved communication technologies - may increase cultural homogeneity 

and decrease polarization of the overall society. However, more recent extensions point to the 

possibility that more contact may also sustain diversity by allowing local minorities to find 

outside support against pressures to conform to local majorities. In the present paper, we argue 

that these studies may not have gone far enough. We show that two relatively small but plausible 

and consequential extensions of Axelrod’s social influence mechanism turn the effect of range of 

communication upside-down. The first extension is to assume a continuous opinion space and 

thus align Axelrod’s model with previous studies of social influence.  The second is to add the 

empirically well supported micro mechanisms of rejection and heterophobia to the model. 

Computational analyses of the resulting model demonstrate that now a larger range of contact can 

increase rather than decreases the extent of polarization in the population, contrary to Axelrod’s 

original conclusion. Further experiments identify the window of conditions under which the 

effect obtains.

Why more contact may increase cultural polarization1

1. Introduction 

Recent decades have seen a dramatic increase in the possibilities for contact between people from 

geographically distant regions of the world, both due to more migration and better 

communication technologies (email, internet). Following Axelrod (1997), a range of formal 

models of cultural dynamics have been proposed that allow to address by what mechanisms and 

under what conditions this development may affect cultural diversity (e.g. Mark 1998, 2003; 

Klemm et al 2003a,b; Kitts et al 1999; Latané and Nowak, 1997). Most of these models combine 

two elementary social mechanisms, homophily and social influence. Homophily is attraction 

towards similar others, or the law that “birds of a feather flock together” (McPherson et al, 2001). 

Social influence is the tendency to adopt opinions of influential others (Festinger et al, 1950). In 

models of cultural dynamics, these two mechanisms usually are linked to each other by the 

assumptions that others are more influential if they are more similar to the focal actor and that 

social influence in turn increases the similarity of interactants.  

A number of studies supported the view that more contact increases cultural 

homogeneity. Axelrod (1997) operationalized contact in terms of the overlap of neighborhoods in 

a cellular grid. If two agents are neighbors and they agree on at least one “feature”, or issue, then 

there is positive probability that they will also come to agree on other issues (cf. Mark, 1998). In 

this model, cultural diversity can be a stable pattern despite ongoing social influence to adapt to 

neighbors’ cultures, because influence stops when actors disagree in all dimensions of the opinion 

space. However, diversity is much reduced and uniform cultures tend to emerge when the

geographical range within which neighbors influence one another increases in size. The reason is 

that a larger range of interaction exposes actors in different local regions to increasingly similar 

influences. As a consequence, it becomes unlikely that local regions are so dissimilar from their 

neighbors that they are entirely cut off from outside influences. Follow-up studies (e.g. Parisi et al 

2003) somewhat modify the exact conditions, but retain the main result.  

Other extensions of Axelrod’s model (e.g. Greig, 2002; Shibani et al 2001) point to a 

different possibility. They demonstrated that a more global range of interaction may allow local 

minorities to find in global communications support against pressures to conform to local 

majorities. When this happens, local minorities may no longer assimilate to the cultural profile of 

the local majority. In this view, more contact stabilizes diversity.  

We agree with the view that more contact does not inevitably entail less diversity. 

However, we believe previous critics may still have underestimated the effect. A larger 

geographical range of contacts may not just help to retain diversity, but it may actually radically 

increase the differences between cultures. We will show in this paper that two relatively small but 

plausible and consequential modifications of Axelrods’ original model suffice to obtain this 

implication.  

 

 The first modification addresses the conceptualization of culture and polarization. 

Axelrod (1997) used a conceptualization of polarization that obscures the fundamental difference 

between stable diversity and antagonism. A “polarized” outcome is seen as equivalent to a 

multicultural state in which neighboring cultures are different on all issues (or features). Cultural 

forms or opinions are modeled as nominal scales. Hence, agents can differ in opinion but the 

extent of their difference can not be expressed in the model. However, many cultural issues are 

better described by ordered or even continuous scales. Most observers would agree that the 

difference between Jazz and Blues is smaller than the difference between any two of these and 

Disco. Accordingly, it is well possible that a “polarized” state in Axelrod’s terms is one in which 

a number of cultures are only slightly different from each other, but they are different on all 

 

 

 

3

aspects. This is clearly inconsistent with empirical studies of polarization (e.g. DiMaggio, Evans, 

and Bryson 1996), who see polarization as the tendency to hold an extreme and uncompromising 

view. More importantly, maximal disagreement, the only condition under which two neighbors 

stop to influence each other according to these models, is a much more exceptional and extreme 

state when issues are continuous. It requires that two neighbors adopt opposite ends of the 

opinion scales on all dimensions of the opinion space. Accordingly, we believe that previous 

modeling work may have overestimated how much cultural diversity can be generated by 

homophily and social influence alone. To test this, we integrate Axelrod’s model with an older 

line of social influence models that neglected homophily, but did use continuous opinion scales 

(e.g. Abelson 1964, Friedkin and Johnson, 1999).  

Moving towards a more fine grained representation of opinion scales seems to make the 

task of explaining stable diversity more difficult. What then may generate persistent diversity or, 

polarization? To answer this question, we draw upon our previous work (Macy et al, 2003) and 

propose a second modification of earlier models.  In most previous modeling studies, social 

influence can only be positive in the sense that in the course of interaction opinions become more 

similar. The only alternative in Axelrod’s model is no interaction at all. However, recent 

modeling work (e.g. Deffuant et al, 2005; Flache and Torenvlied, 2004) has shown that outcomes 

of social influence processes may radically change when at least a minority of agents insulate 

themselves from outside influence, but exert at the same time influence on more moderate others. 

Under this assumption, a few extremists suffice to split the agent society into a small number of 

opposed factions (Deffuant et al, 2005; Hegselmann & Krause, 200?).  

Empirical evidence suggests that social actors may not only isolate themselves from 

social influence, but they may be negatively influenced by others’ opinions (see e.g. Hass, 1981; 

Schwartz and Ames, 1977; Mazen and Leventhal, 1972). Modeling work in the wake of Axelrod 

 

4

neglected this mechanism of rejection or distancing as the mirror image of positive social 

influence2.  

Formal models of cultural dynamics also neglected the negative mirror image of 

homophily, heterophobia. Heterophobia describes the negative evaluation of others who are 

dissimilar. There is some empirical support for the existence of heterophobia in field experiments 

and in school research, where it was found that contacts can entail segregation of friendship 

networks (Baerveldt and Snijders, 1994; Moody, 2001).  

 

Following our earlier work (Macy et al 2003), we propose a model of cultural dynamics 

that integrates the empirically documented mechanisms of rejection and heterophobia. We have 

shown that this extension can radically change cultural dynamics so that polarization becomes the 

most likely and robust outcome of cultural dynamics under a large of conditions. However, this 

work relied on dichotomous opinion scales and did not change contact structures. In the present 

paper, we move further and explicitly model continuous opinions and effects of contact 

structures.  

In the remainder of this paper our model will be explained in Section 2. Section 3 

summarizes the analyses and results. A discussion and conclusions follow in Section 4.  

 

 

2. Model specification  

Our model is an extension of Hopfield’s attractor network (Hopfield, 1982; Nowak & Vallacher, 

1997).  Each  node  has  one  or  more  binary  or  continuous  states  and  is  linked  to  other  nodes 

through endogenous weights. Weights change over time through a Hebbian learning rule (Hebb, 

1949):  the  weight  wij  is  a  function  of  the  similarity  of  states  for  nodes  i  and  j  over  time.  More 

technically, the opinion of agent i on issue k, (1 ≤ k ≤ K), sik, ranges between -1 and +1, (-1 ≤sik ≤ 

                                                 
2 Mark (2003) is as an exception, but he did not integrate rejection with heterophobia, as we propose in the 
present paper. Moreover, Mark did not apply his distancing model to address effects of increased contact 
on diversity.

1). If agents i and j are neighbors, there is a directed positive or negative weight wij, (-1≤wij≤1), 

otherwise  the  weight  is  zero.  Time  is  modeled  in  discreet  influence  round.  Social  influence  is 

modeled such that whenever i adopts his opinions, the change in the position of i with regard to 

issue s is a weighted sum of the distances to all neighbors, sjk- sik, where the weights are given by 

the positive and negative ties. When the tie is negative, the focal actor is influenced to move away 

from the source of influence, when the tie is positive, he moves towards the source of influence 

on  the  corresponding  opinion  dimension.  Moreover,  influence  is  modified  by  a  degree  of 

“moderation” m, that expresses the extent to which influence decreases when opinions differences 

get smaller.  

We see moderation as a society level property, capturing the extent of  “tolerance” with 

regard  to  small  cultural  differences  in  a  society.  We  take  a  moderation  of  m=1  as  the  smallest 

meaningful level. This corresponds to a linear influence function, as used by almost all previous 

models  of  opinion  formation  in  continuous  opinion  spaces.  Higher  levels  of  moderation 

correspond to more “tolerance”. Technically:

Purely  positive  influence  is  modeled  with  the  assumption  of    0≤w≤1,  while  for  positive  and 

negative influence  -1≤w≤1. To be precise, the power in the influence function retains the sign of 

the distance of opinions, and we impose a correction to avoid that opinions go out of bounds. For

For homophily and heterophobia, we assume that the weight 

ijw  increases or decreases over time 

depending on agreement between i and j in the K opinions. If agreement exceeds a threshold level 

then influence is positive, otherwise it is negative. For simplicity, this threshold is the midpoint of 

the interval of opinion differences (zero). Equation (2) formalizes the weight dynamics.

For -1 ≤ s ≤ +1 this function yields results in the range -1 ≤ w ≤ +1. The parameter λ specifies a

move towards the present level of (dis)agreement. To distinguish pure homophily from combined

Social influence and social selection are channeled by an exogenously imposed contact structure. 

Like  Axelrod  (1997),  we  use  a  regular  grid  structure,  but  we  simplify  it  towards  a  one-

dimensional circular grid. Figure 1 below shows how contact range is manipulated. Contact range 

(r) is the population fraction of neighbors to the “left” and “right” of a focal  agent who are his 

neighbors, where neighborhoods are symmetrical.

To avoid artifacts, we use asynchronous updating. In every period one agent is selected at random 

to update either a randomly selected state or a randomly selected weight with equal probability. 

The  duration  of  a  simulation  run  is  expressed  in  number  of  iterations,  where  one  iteration 

corresponds to N*(K + average number of contacts) periods, to assure that on average every state 

and every weight is updated once within one iteration.  

3. Results 

Experiment 1  

 

 

 

We report four simulation experiments. The first two experiments test the effects of our model 

modifications using a baseline scenario comparable to previous studies. The third and fourth 

experiment address effects of contact range.  

Using a nominal opinion space, Axelrod (1997) found that diversity – measured in terms of the 

number of culturally distinct stable groups that co-exist in equilibrium – was fostered by a small 

number of features (dimensions) of the opinion space and a strongly local neighborhood, i.e. 

small overlap between the neighborhoods of neighboring positions on the grid. Accordingly, we 

made overlap between neighborhoods minimal in the sense that all agents had exactly one 

neighbor on both sides. Population size N was set to N=100, yielding a contact range r=2%. The 

number of dimensions of the opinion space was likewise minimal with k=1. Further assumptions 

are a linear influence function (m=1), fast adaptation of weights (λ=1) and uniformly distributed 

8

initial opinions between -1..+1. To model homophily without heterophobia, initial weights are 

updated based on equation (2a), with a weight range between 0 and 1. Initial weights were set 

proportional to the level of initial agreement.  

Figure 1 charts the change of two measures of diversity for the first 6000 iterations of a 

typical simulation run. Both diversity range between 0 (homogeneity) and 1 (maximal diversity). 

“Diversity” is the number of distinct opinions divided by N, where two opinions are distinct when 

they differ by more than 0.005.  “VarianceS” measures the standard deviation of the opinions 

across all population members, divided by 2 for normalization. Figure 1 clearly shows that both 

measures of diversity rapidly decline over time and eventually drop to zero. This result turns out 

to be robust when more replications and longer runs are used. Based on 100 replications, we 

found a mean Diversity and varianceS after 10000 iterations of virtually zero.

The result of the first experiment can be readily explained by insights from social influence 

models in the tradition of Abelson (1964). It has even been shown analytically in this literature 

that with a continuous opinion scale, a very weak condition is sufficient to guarantee full 

homogeneity of opinions in equilibrium: The network needs to be “compact,” such that there are 

9

no subgroups that are entirely cut off from outside influences (Abelson, 1964). These models 

assume that the network of influence is exogenous and static over time. However, the result 

readily generalizes to our analysis.  Except for the unlikely case that two agents adopt opposite 

extremes of the opinion scale from the outset, weights will always be positive and thus the 

network fully connected.  

 

Experiment 2 

Macy et al (2003) included heterophobia and rejection, but they have not used a continuous 

opinion space. This is what we do in the second experiment using the baseline condition of the 

first experiment. The only difference is that we now allow weights to vary between -1 and +1, 

introducing heterophobia and rejection. Technically, weights are now calculated according to 

equation 2 rather than 2a and initial weights are again set proportional to the level of initial 

(dis)agreement, now between -1 and +1.  To measure polarization, we use the variance of 

pairwise agreement across all pairs of agents in the population, where agreement is ranging 

between -1 (total disagreement) and +1 (full agreement), measured as one minus the distance of 

opinions. This measure obviously adopts its lowest level of zero in a uniform opinion 

distribution. Its maximum level of one is obtained when the population is equally divided 

between the opposite ends of the opinion scale3 at -1 and +1. With uniformely distributed 

opinions, the polarization measure would be approximately 0.22. Figure 3 shows the dynamics 

that we typically obtained in simulation runs under the conditions of experiment 2.  

                                                 
3 To see this: In 50% of all dyads the agreement is 1, in 50% it is -1. The average level of disagreement is 
zero and the squared average distance, i.e. the variance, from this is 1. 

 

10

Figure 3. Change of diversity and polarization in one replication of experiment 2.  

 

Figure 3 demonstrates that heterophobia and negative influence radically changed model 

dynamics as compared to experiment 1. While diversity in terms of the number of different 

opinions still declines over time, the variance measure now increases up to approximately 0.5. 

Polarization increases from the level of a uniform distribution (0.22) up to about 0.75, indicating 

that most group members have moved towards one of the two extreme ends of the opinion 

spectrum. The discrepancy between the diversity measures and polarization highlights that 

Axelrod’s identification of stable diversity with polarization is inadequate in a continuous 

framework. An inspection of the corresponding opinion distribution in iteration 2000 further 

illustrates this point. About 90% of all population members are  roughly evenly distributed 

between the opinions of -1 and +1, while the remaining 10% are approximately uniformely 

distributed along the opinion spectrum in between these two extremes. For reliability, we 

replicated this experiments 10 times. The average level of polarization we obtained in iteration 

5000 was about 0.6, well above that of the near consensus we found in experiment 1.  

 

 

11

The explanation for the strong tendency towards polarization in experiment 2 is that with 

all mechanisms operating simultaneously, there is both increasing convergence in opinions and 

liking (positive ties) between initially relatively similar agents and increasing difference and 

disliking (negative ties) between initially relatively dissimilar agents. With only one direction to 

move away from their enemies, agents necessarily adapt their opinions towards the extreme ends 

of the opinion spectrum, pulling their friends with them, or turning friendships into hostile 

relationships in the process. At the same time, some diversity remains due to the highly localized 

contact structures that we generated with a contact range of r=1%. With influence from only one 

agent to the left and right of every focal agent, it is relatively easy for the system to “discover” an 

equilibrium in which opposite influences from the two neighbors exactly balance so that an 

interior position of the focal agent remains stable. This happens when the left and the right 

neighbor differ from the focal agent in opposite directions by the same distance, but are both 

sufficiently similar to still be “friends” (positive weights). Two agents who have no contact with 

each other but who would be enemies (distance larger than one) if they had contact, can then still 

be related to each other by a chain of connected agents who each are friends of their local 

neighbors, but whose positions gradually shift from the one extreme position to the other. This 

explanation suggests that for structures with a larger contact range, it may be more difficult for 

the dynamics of the system to find from a random start a configuration of positions in which 

intermediate opinions between the two extremes can remain stable. For structures with a larger 

contact range, a larger number of agents needs to be coordinated in every local neighborhood. 

This makes it less likely that perfect polarization can be avoided from a random start.  

Experiment 3 

 

 

To test effects of contact range, we used the parameter settings of experiment 2 and varied the 

contact range from r=2% up to r=50% in steps of 2%. Outcome measures were calculated for the 

12

opinion distribution of iteration 1000, based on mean values of ten replications per condition. 

Figure 4 shows the results. 

The figure confirms that increasing contact range r entails higher levels of polarization. 

The polarization measure rises from a level of about 0.6 at r=2%, up to nearly the level of perfect 

polarization (1.0) from r=10% on. This is clearly inconsistent with results from previous models 

of cultural dynamics. More contact also reduces diversity. Only 2 distinct opinions (+1 and -1) 

survive beyond r=10% with a variance measure of 0.5.

Experiment 4. 

The baseline scenario of experiment 1 would have generated a high level of diversity in 

Axelrod’s framework. But some conditions of this baseline scenario may weaken the effect of 

contact on polarization. To test robustness, we varied the number of issues, k, and the level of 

moderation, m, in experiment 4a and 4b, respectively.     

13

In line with Macy et al (2003), we may interpret the number of issues, k, as an indicator 

of the “broad mindedness” of a society. Intuitively, broad mindedness may reduce tendencies 

towards polarization, because it generates more possibilities for overlap and thus for positive 

influence between neighbors. This corresponds to results obtained by Axelrod (1997; cf. Klemm, 

2003a,b). To test this possibility, we replicated experiment 3 with k=2. Figure 5 shows the results 

of this analysis.

Figure 5 shows that k=2 radically changes the effect of contact range. While we found with k=1 

that contact range increases polarization, we now obtain a negative effect on polarization. The 

explanation is that more issues reduces the likelihood of initial negative, because the probability 

declines that two agents are sufficiently different on all issues. As a consequence, most agents are 

drawn towards the average opinion in their neighborhood and thus move away from the extreme 

ends of the opinion distribution. A larger contact range only amplifies this convergence to the 

mean, because large neighborhoods are more representative of the overall population.

Consistently, we found even lower levels of polarization when the number of issues was further 

increased.    

A higher level of moderation resurrects the effect of contact on polarization at least 

partially. This may seem counterintuitive at first. However, higher moderation implies that agents 

are influenced less by others who have similar opinions, in comparison with the influence 

experienced from dissimilar others. Higher moderation thus makes negative influences stronger in 

comparison with positive influences. We conducted a further simulation experiment (4b) in which 

we used the conditions of experiment 4a with one change, we increased the level of moderation 

from m=1 to m=2.4

Figure 6. Results of experiment 4b. Effect of contact range r on diversity measures and 

polarization measure in iteration 1000 with k=2 issues and moderation m=2. 

Figure 6 confirms the expectation. With higher moderation, contact range can again increase the 

level of cultural polarization. But the figure shows a more complex, non-linear effect than we 

found before for k=1. Higher contact range increases polarization only between r=2% and 

approximately r=18%. The level of polarization does not change remarkably between r=18% and 

                                                 
4 We also tested the effect of increasing moderation for the baseline condition of a single issue space (k=1). 
As suggested by the above reasoning, this only increased the already high level of polarization shown by 
figure 4.

r=42% and it declines beyond r=42%. This reflects the interplay of two opposite effects of 

contact range, increasing complexity of coordination (fostering polarization) and increasing 

exposure to the population mean (fostering homogeneity). Further simulations with more issues 

confirmed the inverted U-shaped effect, but only when moderation was likewise increased. The 

more broad minded our simulated society, the higher is the level of moderation at which the 

effect of contact range on polarization turns from a negative effect into a positive one.   

 

 

4. Discussion and conclusion 

Axelrod (1997) initiated prominently a line of computational models of cultural influence that 

suggest that more contact between geographically dissimilar regions may reduces. In this paper, 

we have shown that this conclusion critically hinges upon the representation of opinion scales as 

nominal. We showed that with the assumption of continuous opinions, stable cultural diversity 

can no longer be readily explained in this framework, unless negative social influence and 

heterophobia are added to the model. These mechanisms imply contrary to previous work, that 

contact may under certain conditions increase rather than decrease polarization.  

 

This study relies on a number of simplifications that need to be carefully examined. We 

will discuss a number of those simplifications below and give arguments why we expect that they 

do not fundamentally limit generality of our conclusions. We have partially also tested these 

argument with explorative simulation studies and will extend this in future work. For one thing, 

our framework is not fully compatible with the one used in the tradition of Axelrod (1997), 

because we use a one dimensional geographical space rather than the two dimensional space used 

by Axelrod. However, analytical work by Klemm and others (2003a,b) has shown that this 

simplification is not critical for the results that Axelrod has obtained, so we see no apparent 

reason why it should be critical for ours. These analytical studies have also revealed that 

Axelrod’s result of stable diversity may critically hinge upon another condition, the absence of 

random noise in opinions. We expect that noise is less critical for our main conclusions, because 

16

the polarized outcomes we are interested are highly stable against a small level of random 

changes in opinions. When in a polarized outcome some agents change from time to time their 

opinion on some issue, they are either immediately “drawn back” to the pole of their “friends”, or 

they change sides and move to the other pole if the opinion change was large enough. A further 

potential limitation is that we only used a regular lattice structure and not supposedly more 

realistic models of social contact structures, like the celebrated small world or scale free 

networks. Again, we do not believe that the effects of contact range may radically different in 

such structures. Consider a small world network consisting of sparsely connected local clusters. 

Higher contact range in such a network means more ties between clusters. This has exactly the 

same effects on the dynamics of social influence and social selection that we found in a regular 

framework. It increases the exposure of all society members to the overall mean – thus hampering 

polarization – and it increases the coordination complexity of diverse equilibria in strongly 

clustered network – thus fostering polarization. As a final simplification, we have neglected that 

agents may not only differ on “flexible” opinions but also on “fixed” demographical 

characteristics (see also Macy et al, 2003). Demographical differences tend to correlate with 

geographical location. As a consequence, we expect that including fixed agent attributes increases 

rather than decreases the potential for heterophibia and rejection in the simulated societies. 

Hence, this complication may not limit but actually strengthen the effect of contact range on 

polarization.  

 

To conclude, we believe to have demonstrated that contrary to what previous models of 

cultural dynamics suggest, an increase of contact between geographically distant regions may 

increase rather than decrease cultural polarization in society. More theoretical analyses and 

empirical work are needed to assess the empirical relevance of this result. In any case, our finding 

should caution modelers of cultural dynamics against overestimating the positive effects of 

contacts on cultural convergence.

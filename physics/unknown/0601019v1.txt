Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of how to calculate bit error ratio (BER) with 

physical  explanation  for  optically  pre-amplified  DPSK  receivers  using  optical 

Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  (MZI)  demodulation  and  balanced  detection.  It  is  shown 

that BER calculation method for this kind of receivers is different from the conventional 

calculation  method  used  widely  for  IM/DD  receivers.  An  analytical  relationship  in 

receiver  sensitivity  between  DPSK  receivers  using  MZI  demodulation  with  balanced 

detection  and  IM/DD  receivers  (or  DPSK  receivers  using  MZI  demodulation  and 

single-port  detection)  is  given  based  on  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation.  Our 

calculation  method  correctly  predicts  the  3-dB  improvement  of  receiver  sensitivity  by 

using  balanced  detection  over  single-port  detection  or  IM/DD  receivers.  Furthermore, 

quantum-limited DPSK receivers with MZI demodulation are also analyzed.   

Key words: Optical communication, optical receivers, phase-shifted key, bit error ratio, 

wavelength division multiplexing.

I. Introduction 

Differential phase shifted keying (DPSK) is one of enabling techniques for the reduction 

of  fiber  Kerr  nonlinearity  in  dense  wavelength  division  multiplexing  (DWDM)  fiber 

transmissions 

[1]-[3].  Moreover,  DPSK  combined  with  optical  Mach-Zehnder

interferometer  (MZI)  demodulation  and  balanced  detection  (referred  to  DPSK/MZI 

receivers  with  balanced  detection  thereafter)  provides  a  full  optical  demodulation  and 

3-dB  improvement  in  receiver  sensitivity  over  single-port  detection  or  intensity 

modulation/direct  detection  (IM/DD)  receivers  (DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port 

detection is equivalent to IM/DD receivers if optically pre-amplified) [1-4]. In optically 

pre-amplified  IM/DD  receivers,  noise  statistic  with  optically  amplified  spontaneous 

emission (ASE) noise is characterized by the Chi-square distribution [5]. The Chi-square 

distribution  is  well  approximated  by  the  Gaussian  distribution,  which  has  been  widely 

used  for  IM/DD  receivers  [5-8].  This  is  because  ASE-ASE  beat  noise  is  only 

over-estimated  by  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  and  bit  error  ratio  (BER)  is  thus 

slightly  over-estimated  by  using  Gaussian  noise  approximation.  Since  optical  DPSK 

signal  is  converted  into  optical  intensity  modulated  by  MZI  demodulator,  the  physical 

process  of  the  signal  and  ASE  noise  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  is  more  close  to  IM/DD 

receivers  than  the  conventional  DPSK  receivers  which  have  electrical  demodulation 

(consisting  of  an  electrical  time-delay  and  a  mixer).  Calculation  of  BER  for  optically 

pre-amplified IM/DD receivers has been well established and understood [5-8]. However, 

calculation  of  BER  for  optically  pre-amplified  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced 

detection has not been fully understood so far. In such a receiver, both bits “1” and “0” 

have  non-zero  decision  currents,  rather  than  that  only  bit  “1”  has  non-zero  current  in 

IM/DD receivers. This suggests that both bits “1” and “0” are detectable in DPSK/MZI 

receivers  with  balanced  detection;  and  only  bit  “1”  is  detectable  in  IM/DD  receivers  in 

principle. Suppose that a bit “1” and a bit “0” are transmitted, and the bit “1” becomes 

zero-current  due  to  some  reasons  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  and 

IM/DD  receivers.  Thus,  an  error  occurs  in  IM/DD  receivers  since  bit  “0”  always  has 

zero-current and bits “1” and “0” are not distinguishable. In contrast, bit “0” has non-zero 

current  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection,  and  bits  “1”  and  “0”  are  still 

possible to be distinguished. This is the physical origin of why DPSK/MZI receivers with 

balanced  detection  provide  3-dB  advantage  over  single-port  detection  or  IM/DD 

receivers.  Therefore,  the  same  way  as  for  IM/DD  receivers  in  theoretical  calculation  of 

BER  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  may  not  be  correct  [3],  [8]. 

Recently,  we  used  the  exact  probability  density  function  (pdf)  of  noise  statistics  in

threshold current. It was verified that the ~3-dB improvement obtained previously in [3] 

[8] by using balanced detection is due to ASE-ASE beat noise in the two ports [9],[10].   

On  the  other  hand,  noise  statistics  become  the  Gaussian  if  ASE-ASE  beat  noise  is 

ignored,  and  ASE-ASE  beat  noise  is  only  over-estimated  by  the  Gaussian  noise 

approximation  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  as  in  IM/DD  receivers 

[9].  As  mentioned  above,  ~3-dB  improvement  by  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced 

detection  over  single-port  detection  or  IM/DD  receivers  as  shown  in  [3],[8]  is  due  to 

two-port ASE-ASE beat noise, which induces the pdf shape deviated from the Gaussian 

distribution  as  shown  in  [9].  When  signal-ASE  beat  noise  is  completely  dominant  (i.e. 

noise statistic becomes Gaussian), the ~3-dB improvement predicted in [3],[8] disappears 

if the above CEP is considered BER. Thus, DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection 

do not have 3-dB advantage and the performance of DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced 

detection  or  single-port  detection  and  IM/DD  receivers  is  identical.  This  does  not 

converge  with  the  measurements  in  which  3-dB  improvement  is  always  obtained  no 

matter what signal power is used [1],[2],[4]. Moreover, the measured 3-dB improvement 

by balanced detection is well explained by signal constellation comparison [3], in which 

the signal energy used for error detection in DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection 

is double of that in single-port detection. Moreover, the signal constellation can be used 

for  the  two  receiver  comparison  only  when  the  two  receivers  have  the  same  noise 

statistics. In other words, it is impossible to express the ASE-ASE beat noise induced pdf 

difference by using signal energy as shown in [3]. Consequently, the 3-dB improvement 

predicted 

in 

[3],[8],  based  on 

the

Rejected by J. of Lightwave Technol.    Dec. 2005 

scaled to 3-dB Q factor only if the signal-ASE beat noise is dominating. If the predicted 

3-dB in [3],[8] which is induced by ASE-ASE beat noise is the measured 3-dB, the above 

scale does not hold. But this scale always holds as shown in [1]. 

Recently,  we  proposed  a  calculation  BER  method  and  obtained  3-dB  improvement  for 

optically  pre-amplified  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  [10]  based  on  the 

Gaussian noise statistics. In this paper, we will show that how to explain and understand 

the  calculation  method  of  BER  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection,  and 

compare it with that for IM/DD receivers. Based on the Gaussian noise, the relationship 

of  equivalent  or  effective  Q-factor,  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection, 

with Q factor for IM/DD receivers is given analytically. 

II. BER calculation method   

The  optically  pre-amplified  DPSK/MZI  receiver  with  balanced  detection  is  shown 

schematically  in  Fig.  1.  The  incoming  optical  signal  from  an  optical  pre-amplifier  is 

expressed by an electric field 

. The optical filter is assumed an ideal filter and only 

( )tEin

used for filtering ASE noise, and the output from the optical filter is expressed in electric 

field 

( )tE1

.  The  optical  MZI,  which  consists  of  two  ideal  3-dB  optical  couplers  and  a 

piece of fiber used for time delay, converts the phase modulated signal into an amplitude 

modulated. The two outputs from the MZI are represented by electric fields 

( )tE−

  and 

( )tE+

,  from  the  destructive  and  constructive  ports,  respectively.  For  an  ideal  MZI,  the 

relationships between two outputs and input are given by

  is  the

Suppose that a bit “1” and a bit “0” are transmitted. Figure 2(a) shows the currents of bits 

“1” and “0” for a noise free DPSK/MZI receiver with balanced detection. For such a case, 

the decision threshold is set zero and no errors occur. Due to some reasons, the current of 

bit  “0”  is  assumed  to  become  positive  but  less  than  the  current  of  bit  “1”  i.e. 

I

0

( )

<

( )

, as shown in Fig. 2(b). By adjusting the decision threshold the bits “1” and 

“0”  are  still  correctly  detected  (similar  to  IM/DD  receivers).  However,  for  the  case  as 

shown in Fig. 2(c) i.e. 

I

0

( )
t

, bit errors certainly occur, and the errors are totally 

induced by bit “0”. Similarly, errors are induced by bit “1” only if

Alternatively,  expressions  (4)  can  be  obtained  as  follows.  Because  the  currents  for  bits

detection for bit “1” is made by the current 

  with the reference to bit “0” current

with the reference of bit “0” current, and vice versa. Therefore, the equivalent decision

2 sI−

variances  of 

1y   and

By comparing BER expressions of (4) and (5), it is seen that the expressions of BER for 

both bits “1” and “0” are very similar, and the only differences are the equivalent means 

and  variances  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  and  IM/DD  receivers,

besides that the decision threshold in DPSK/MZI receivers with ideal balanced detection 

is always zero, independent of the means and variances. 

III. Relationship of Q factors 

Since  the  ASE-ASE  beat  noise  is  only  over-estimated  by  the  Gaussian  noise 

approximation  in  both  IM/DD  and  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection, 

particularly for the last ones [9], BER calculated by the Gaussian noise is over-estimated. 

However,  the  Gaussian  noise  approximation  still  provides  us  with  a  fair  estimation  of 

BER  since  signal-ASE  beat  noise  is  usually  dominating  and  has  the  Gaussian  noise. 

Therefore,  we  analyze  Q-factor  for  IM/DD  receivers  and  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with 

balanced detection based on the simple Gaussian noise. For IM/DD receivers, it is well 

known  and  given  by

It is shown by (6) that the exact 3-dB improvement of Q factor by DPSK/MZI receivers 

with  ideal  balanced  detection  over  IM/DD  receivers  is  achieved  if  only  including  the 

signal-ASE beat noise in the two receivers. For the case of ASE-ASE beat noise included, 

an additional improvement of ~1 dB due to ASE-ASE beat noise is obtained by using the 

Gaussian  noise  approximation  for  the  typical  receiver  bandwidths,  instead  of  ~3  dB  by 

using  the  exact  noise  statistics  given  in  [9].  Therefore,  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with 

balanced detection ultimately outperform IM/DD receivers or DPSK/MZI receivers with 

single-port detection by exact 3 dB. In [3] the 3-dB improvement is interpreted by signal 

constellation.  Our  predicted  3-dB  improvement  by  using  balanced  detection  converges 

with the interpretation of the 3-dB improvement by signal constellation.   

One serious argument is that bits “1” and “0” never appear at the same time physically, 

therefore  BER  calculation  cannot  be  based  on  the  conditions  of

  [11]  because  either  bit  “1”  or  “0”  only  appears  at  the  decision 

instant.  In  other  words,  when  bit  “1”  is  being  detected  bit  “0”  is  not  known  and  vice 

versa.  Before  we  answer  this  argument  we  first  review  BER  calculation  for  IM/DD 

receivers.  It  is  well  known  that  BER  calculation  for  IM/DD  receivers  is  based  on  the 

optimal  decision  threshold  [5]-[8].  We  also  know  that  the  optimal  decision  threshold  is 

calculated by using the decision currents and variances of both bits “1” and “0” [5]-[8]. If 

bit “1” is being detected and bit “0” is not known, BER for IM/DD receivers cannot be 

calculated based on the optimal decision threshold because bit “0” is not known and it is 

impossible  to  know  the  optimal  decision  threshold.  Moreover,  Q-factor  for  IM/DD 

 

 

 

 

10

Rejected by J. of Lightwave Technol.    Dec. 2005 

receivers  is  also  calculated  based  on  the  optimal  decision  threshold.  This  suggests  that 

BER  and  Q-factor  calculations  for  IM/DD  receivers  are  incorrect.  However,  calculated 

BER  and  Q-factor  based  on  the  optimal  decision  threshold  for  IM/DD  receivers  have 

been  verified  experimentally  and  used  for  tens  of  decades.  Consequently,  the 

understanding of which when bit “1” is being detected and bit “0” is not known and vice 

versa in BER calculation is incorrect.   

IV. Conclusions 

We have, for the first time, presented an analysis of how to calculate BER and provided 

physical  explanation  of  BER  calculation  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced 

detection.  The  simple  relationship  of  Q  factors  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced 

detection and IM/DD receivers is given based on the Gaussian noise approximation. The 

predicted  improvement  of  3-4  dB  based  on  the  Gaussian  noise  agrees  well  with  the 

measured  [1]-[4].  Moreover,  our  predicted  3-dB  improvement  has  no  conflict  with  the 

signal constellation.

Appendix B: Quantum limited DPSK/MZI receivers 

In this Appendix we present BER analysis for DPSK/MZI receivers considering quantum 

noise  (shot  noise)  only.  The  quantum  limited  receiver  sensitivity  of  DPSK  receivers, 

given by 

BER

quantum limited BER was obtained for DPSK with electrical demodulation (referred to 

the  conventional  DPSK  receiver  thereafter),  which  consists  of  an  electrical  time  delay 

line and an electrical mixer, based on Rice (bit “1”) and Rayleigh (bit “0”) noise statistics 

[12],[13].  However,  the  optical  MZI  demodulator  in  DSPK/MZI  receivers  converts 

DPSK  optical  signal  into  intensity  modulated  before  the  injection  to  the  optical 

photodiodes. The noise statistic of quantum noise in DPSK/MZI receivers does not have 

the  Rice  and  Rayleigh  probability  distributions;  and  as  a  matter  of  fact  the 

Gaussian/Poisson noise distribution should be used as in IM/DD receivers [6, pp.167]. 

Moreover,  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  could  be  different  from 

DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  detection  in  quantum  limited  receiver  sensitivity, 

because  the  signal  energy  used  for  error  detection  is  different  in  the  two  detections. 

Consequently,  it  could  be  expected  that  the  quantum  limited  BER  for  DPSK/MZI 

receivers  with  single-port  or  balanced  detections  may  be  different  from  that  of  the 

conventional  DPSK  receivers.  In  this  Appendix,  we  present  a  quantum  limited  analysis 

for DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port or balanced detection.   

B.1 Definitions of quantum- and quasi-quantum noise   

When  quantum  noise  is  only  considered,  a  small  number  of  photons  and  electron-hole 

pairs present (i.e., the number of photons and electrons are countable). The noise statistics 

for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  should  follow  the  Poisson  distribution  (a  discrete  probability 

distribution) as in IM/DD receivers [6, pp.167]. As the number of photons and electrons 

becomes  large  enough,  the  noise  statistics  can  be  characterized  by  the  Gaussian 

distribution  (a  continuous  probability  distribution).  In  this  Appendix,  quasi-quantum 

limited (QQL) analysis is referred if the quantum noise is considered to be the Gaussian 

noise,  to  distinguish  it  from  the  quantum  limited  (QL)  analysis  in  which  the  quantum 

noise  is  considered  to  be  Poisson  noise.  For  the  conventional  DPSK  receivers,  BER 

expression  of 

BER

  [12],[13] 

is  corresponding 

to  our  defined

B.2 Quantum limited analysis 

We first analyze the quantum limited (Poisson noise statistics) DPSK/MZI receivers. We 

first  consider  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  detection.  If

pN -  the  photon  number  in  bit  “1”,  and  corresponding  to  the 

average  optical  power  of  the  DPSK  signal),  no  errors  from  bit  “1”  occur.  Since  bit  “0” 

has zero photons and noise free, bit “0” is not detectable and BER is totally determined 

by bit “1” (Note 

0m ≡
0

  the number of electron-hole pairs in bit “0”) similar to IM/DD 

receivers [6, pp.167]. Therefore the quantum limited BER is given by setting 

0m =
1

  in 

the above Poisson distribution similar to IM/DD receives [6, pp.167], i.e.

The  receiver  sensitivity  given  by  (B1)  is  3-dB  worse  than  that  in  IM/DD  receivers  [6,

,  the  peak  power  of  bit  “1”  is  assumed  twice  the

average power). This can be explained that only the half signal energy is used for error 

detection  in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  single-port  detection  rather  than  the  full  signal 

energy in IM/DD receivers.   

For  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection,  bits  “1”  and  “0”  contain  the  same 

number of photons. When bit “1” is transmitted, no errors occur if

same as for DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port detection, in which no errors occur if

0m =

Consequently, no errors occur if

The factor 1/2 is due to two bits. By comparing (B1) and (B2), we can find that the 3-dB 

quantum limited receiver sensitivity is improved by DPSKMZI receivers with balanced 

detection over single-port detection. On the other hand, the same quantum limited BER 

for  DPSK/MZI 

receivers  with 

balanced 

detection 

as 

IM/DD 

receivers 

(

BER

=

) is obtained. This is because the two receivers use the same 

1
2

(

p )

signal  energy  for  error  detection  and  also  have  the  same  total  noise  variance.  The 

expression (B2) is given for the first time. It is shown that the quantum limit BERs are 

different for DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port or balanced detection. Therefore, it is 

not correct to use the expression (B1) for DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced detection 

[3]. If non-ideal photodiodes are considered, 

pNη   should replace 

pN   in (B1) and (B2), 

η- the quantum efficiency of the photodiodes.   

Furthermore,  it  is  observed  that  the  expression  (B1)  for  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with 

single-port  detection  is  the  same  as  the  conventional  DPSK  receivers.  However  BER 

given  by  (B1)  is  obtained  based  on  the  discrete  Poisson  distribution,  rather  than  the 

continuous Rice and Rayleigh distributions. Particularly, it is worth emphasizing that the 

quantum-limited BER expression of 

BER

=

exp

Nη
−

, which has been widely used 

1

(

p )

for DPSK receivers [6],[8],[13], is only correct for DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port 

detection and the conventional DPSK receivers.   

B.3 Quasi-quantum limited analysis 

We  now  start  the  analysis  for  the  quasi-quantum  limited  (Gaussian  noise  statistics) 

DPSK/MZI  receivers.  For  DPSK/MZI  receivers  (either  single-port  or  balanced 

detections),  the  electrical  signal-to-noise  ratio  is  the  same  as  that  in  IM/DD  receivers 

provided that the average optical power in DPSK/MZI and IM/DD receivers is the same.

In (B4) the same conditions as in (B3) have been applied in the last step. By comparing 

(B3) and (B4), it is found that BER given by (B3) and (B4) differs from 3-dB in receiver 

sensitivity. In other words, 3-dB receiver sensitivity is improved by DPSK/MZI receivers 

with  balanced  detection  over  single-port  detection  in  the  quantum  limit.  On  the  other 

hand,  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection  has  the  same  quantum  limit  as 

IM/DD receivers, since the total signal energy and noise variance, used for error detection 

in  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced  detection,  is  exactly  the  same  as  in  IM/DD 

receivers.  The  BER  expressions  of  (B3)  and  (B4)  are  different  from  the  expression  of

B.4 Summary   

In Appendix B we have presented an analysis of DPSK/MZI receivers with single-port or 

balanced  detections,  considering  the  quantum  noise  only.  We  have  found  that  3-dB 

quantum limited receiver sensitivity differs between DPSK/MZI receivers with balanced 

detection  and  single-port  detection.  Moreover,  DPSK/MZI  receivers  with  balanced 

detection has the same quantum limit as IM/DD receivers, since the total signal energy 

and noise variance for error detection in both receivers are the same. The quantum limited 

BER  with

Dear Dr. Zhang: 

We have received the reviewers' comments on your manuscript 

JLT-08703-2005, "Calculation of Bit Error Ratio for 

 Optically Pre-Amplified DPSK Receivers Using Optical 

Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Demodulation and Balanced 

Detection."   I regret to say that, based on the attached 

reviews, this paper does not meet our publication requirements. 

Although we may have misjudged some aspect of this paper that 

you consider important, we do not encourage resubmission.   The 

extra time delays and demands on reviewers are counter to our 

objective to publish important new results rapidly. 

Nevertheless, thank you for allowing us to examine the paper, 

and I hope you will consider submitting new manuscripts to 

Journal of Lightwave Technology in the future. 

Sincerely, 

Douglas M. Hargis, Publications Coordinator

Reviewer 1 Comments: 

       The presented paper describes the BER expression for 

optical amplified DPSK receivers. This subject was intensively 

studied in recent years, and then a number of trials have been 

carried out to address this issue, to date. The claim in the 

21

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Rejected by J. of Lightwave Technol.    Dec. 2005 

submitted paper has been fundamentally well known in the several 

publications. Therefore, the reviewer does not find sufficient 

originality. The prior publications are listed as below; 

Section II 

The BER expression for DPSK and OOK is seen in for example; - 

Stein, Seymour & J.Jay Jones, �Modern Communication Principles,� 

McGraw Hill, 1967-. 

Section III 

A modified Q factor was already proposed in � C. Xu, X. Liu; X. 

Wei, �Differential phase-shift keying for high spectral 

efficiency optical transmissions,� J. Selected Topics in Quantum 

Electron, vol. 10, no. 2, pp. 281- 293, 2004-. 

Unless the authors drastically change the main body clear to 

readers that the claim is sufficiently supported with sufficient 

originality, the reviewer has to say that the submitted paper 

cannot be accepted. 

Reviewer 2 Comments: 

                   The authors propose a paper dealing with the calculation 

of BER in optically pre-amplified DPSK receivers using optical 

Mach-Zehnder Interferometer demodulation and balanced 

detection. 

            As said in the abstract, the purpose of the study is the 

derivation of a modified Q-factor for DPSK systems, linked with 

the conventional and well-known Q-factor in IM/DD systems.

Rejected by J. of Lightwave Technol.    Dec. 2005 

            The authors derive a new form for Q-factor (amplitude Gaussian 

noises) in DPSK systems and confirm the 3 dB gain performed with 

the balanced detection compared to the single ended detection. I 

think that it is a good start but should be completed by: 

            1. Recently, some works [1] reports that conventional Q-factor 

is not appropriate to calculate the BER of DPSK systems, and 

typically the conventional method underestimates the performance 

(BER) in the linear regimes and overestimates the BER in the 

high non linear regimes (figure 10 in ref[1]). As a new Q-factor 

is proposed, could the author obtain such a curve (figure 10 in 

ref[1]) and compare their results on this point? 

            2. All the pdfs used for noises are assumed to be Gaussian. 

Does it is sufficient to obtain a good estimation of the 

performances in DPSK systems? If yes could you justify it? 

            3. The expression of theta(t) (page 5) given for the DPSK 

signal assumes that the DPSK signal has no phase noise at the 

receiver. As Kerr effect in optical fiber degrades DPSK signals 

along propagation and induce non linear phase noise, I think 

that theta(t) should contain a noise contribution. What is the 

justification of authors to this point? 

            4. The interest of Appendix B is not clearly showed: as the 

authors don�t mention it in the main text, could you precise the 

main interest of this part for your work (could you include it 

in the main text?). As the results of BER are expressed (table 

1) with the erfc function (limit of the BER = 0 for high values 

of Np), how the non-linear regime with these formulas can be 

considered (compared with figure 10 in ref[1])?

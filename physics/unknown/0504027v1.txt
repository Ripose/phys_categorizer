Abstract 
We  propose  a  scenario  that  involves  a  stationary  observer  who  detects  a  point  like 
source of light moving with constant velocity at a constant altitude, using a telescope 
and  a  frequency-meter.  We  derive  a  formula  for  the  angular  velocity  at  which  we 
should rotate the axis of the telescope and a formula that relates the proper period at 
which  the  source  emits  successive  wave  crests  and  the  proper  period  at  which  the 
stationary observer receives them.  
 
1. Watching the moving source using a telescope 
 
The scenario we propose involves an observer R located at the origin O of the inertial 
reference frame K(XOY) who is handling a telescope. A point like source of light S’ 

moves parallel to the OX axis with constant velocity v (

). Let h be the constant 

altitude (Figure 1). K’ is the rest frame of the source in which we define its position 
by  the  space  coordinates  (
).  Source  S’  emits  light  continuously  in  all 
directions in space. At a time of emission te we define the position of the source in K 
by the space coordinates 

                                                                                                                       (1) 
 .                                                                                                                          (2)

The light signal emitted at te arrives at the location of R when its clock reads tr, related 
to te by the obvious relation 

                                                                                                    (3) 

Solving for te relation (3) leads to 

                                                                                       (4) 

where we have taken into account the solution with physical meaning (tr=0; te=-dc-1). 
Watching  the  moving  source  observer  R  should  continuously  rotate  the  axis  of  his 
telescope, which is at an angle θ relative to the positive direction of the OX axis at a 
time tr given by 

  .                                                          (5)  

At a time tr the angular velocity at which R should rotate the axis of his telescope is 

                                                         (6)

In  Figure  2  we  present  the  variation  of  the  angular  velocity  ω  with  tr for  a  constant 

value of β and different values of 

, whereas in Figure 3 we present the variation of 

ω with tr for a constant value of  

 and different values of β.

The derivation performed above does not invoke the special relativity theory but is in 
agreement  with  it  by  because  distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of 
relative motion are relativistic invariants as in Galileo’s relativity. 
 
2. The time dependent Doppler formula  
The  scenario  presented  in  Figure1  leads  to  a  Doppler  formula  as  well.  Presenting 
relation (3) as 

                                                                                                                  (8) 

where  re  represents  the  magnitude  of  the  position  vector  of  S’  in  the  K  reference 
frame and differentiating both its sides we obtain 

 .                                                                                                 (9) 

In deriving relation (9) we have taken into account that, by definition, 

                                                                                                         (10) 

represents the radial component of the instantaneous velocity of S’. 
A clock commoving with the source measures a proper time interval

from which relation (10) becomes 

.                                                                                                   (12) 

If we consider that dtr represents the “very small” proper period at which R receives 
the successive light signals emitted by S’ at a “very small” proper period of reception 
 we can consider that relation (12) describes the Doppler Effect in the case of an 
oblique incidence of the successive light signals emitted by the source to the receiver. 
So far, we have considered that the periods 
are small enough that it can be 
considered that S’ emits two successive light signals from the same point in space. 
Taking into account that 

 and 

  

                                          (13) 

we can express relation (12) as a function of the reception time tr. 
In Figure 4 we present the variation of the Doppler factor 

                                                                                                                    (14)

We say that deriving the Doppler formula (14) we have made the “very small” period 
assumption. The plane wave assumption (very large source-receiver distance) leads to 
the  same  result1  and  so  astronomers  will  consider  that  relation  (14)  and  the  results 
presented in Figure 4 and in Figure 5  hold exactly. 
 
3. Conclusions 

Watching a point like  source that moves with constant velocity 

 at  a constant 

altitude 

  using  a  telescope  we  should  rotate  it  continuously.  We  show  that  the 

instantaneous angular velocity ω at which we should rotate the axis of the telescope 

depends  on  v  and  on 

  as  well.  Its  peak  value  decreases  if  velocity  and  altitude 

increase.  The  derivation  involves  special  relativity  only  by  the  invariance  of  the 
altitude, a distance measured perpendicular to the direction of relative motion. 
We  also  derive  a  relationship  between  the  period  at  which  the  moving  source  emits 
)  and  the  period  at  which  a  stationary  observer  receives 
successive  wave  crests  (

them  (dtr)  defining  a  Doppler  factor

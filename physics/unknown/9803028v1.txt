dimensional algebras of hidden symmetries related to gauge and conformal transforma-
tions.

Introduction

Yang-Mills theory is a non-Abelian generalization of the Maxwell theory of electromagnetism. The
dynamics of the non-Abelian gauge ﬁelds is described by the Yang-Mills (YM) equations, and the
study of the space of solutions to the YM equations is of particular interest. In 1975 the equations
giving a very important subclass of solutions to the YM equations were introduced [3]. These
equations were called the self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations; their solutions provide absolute
minima for the Yang-Mills functional in Euclidean 4-space. There exists a large literature on the
geometric meaning of the SDYM equations (see e.g. [1, 12, 18, 11]).

Our aim is to investigate inﬁnitesimal symmetries of the SDYM equations. Under a symmetry
we understand a transformation which maps solutions of the SDYM equations into solutions of
these equations. In other words, symmetry transformations preserve the solution space. It is known
that all local symmetries of the SDYM equations, which are also called manifest symmetries, are
given by gauge transformations and conformal transformations. Since 1979, in a number of papers
[14], it was shown that the SDYM equations have nonlocal, so-called ‘hidden’ symmetries which
are related to global gauge transformations. More general gauge-type symmetries were described
in [16, 15, 5, 9]. In [13], an aﬃne extension of conformal symmetries was introduced. The twistor
interpretation of this algebra was discussed in [9]. But the problem of describing all possible (local
and nonlocal) symmetries is not yet solved.

The paper is organized as follows: In §§ 2,3 we recall the main deﬁnitions (for more details
see e.g. [6, 7]) and the Penrose-Ward twistor correspondence [17, 2, 12, 18, 11]. In §§ 4,5 we give
a cohomological description of the inﬁnitesimal symmetries of the SDYM equations by reducing
this problem to the problem of describing inﬁnitesimal symmetries of holomorphic bundles over a
twistor space.

2 Deﬁnitions and notation

2.1. The SDYM equations. Let us consider a principal ﬁbre bundle P = P (R4, SU (n)) over the
Euclidean space R4 with the structure group SU (n). Let Aµ(x) be components of the connection
1-form A = Aµ(x)dxµ in the bundle P , x ∈ R4, µ, ν, ... = 1, ..., 4. Here and in what follows
summation over repeated indices is understood. By deﬁnition, components Fµν (x) of the curvature
2-form F = 1
2 Fµν (x)dxµ ∧ dxν in P are Fµν (x) = [Dµ, Dν ] = [∂µ + Aµ, ∂ν + Aν] = ∂µAν − ∂νAµ +
[Aµ, Aν ], ∂µ := ∂/∂xµ. Fields Aµ and Fµν take values in the Lie algebra su(n).

The self-dual Yang-Mills (SDYM) equations have the form

Fµν =

εµνρσFρσ,

where εµνρσ is the completely antisymmetric tensor on R4 and ε1234 = 1.

2.2. Manifest symmetries of the SDYM equations. As is known, eqs.(1) are invariant

under the algebra of inﬁnitesimal gauge transformations

Aµ 7→ Aϑ

µ = Aµ + δϑAµ + ...,

δϑAµ = ∂µϑ + [Aµ, ϑ], ϑ(x) ∈ su(n)

and under the algebra of inﬁnitesimal conformal transformations

Aµ 7→ AN

µ = Aµ + δN Aµ + ...,

where a vector ﬁeld N = N ν∂ν is any generator

of the 15-parameter conformal group that is locally isomorphic to the group SO(5, 1) [7]. Here {Xa}
and {Ya} generate two commuting SO(3) subgroups in SO(4), Pµ are the translation generators,

2.4. Twistor space for R4. Let C+ := {λ ∈ CP 1 : |λ| ≤ 1 + α}, where 0 < α < 1 is a
positive real number, C− := {λ ∈ CP 1 : |λ| ≥ 1 − α} (including λ = ∞). Then C+ and C− form a
two-set open cover of the Riemann sphere CP 1 with the intersection Cα = C+ ∩ C− = {λ : 1 − α ≤
|λ| ≤ 1 + α}. The vector ﬁeld ∂¯λ := ∂/∂¯λ is antiholomorphic (0, 1) vector ﬁeld with respect to the
standard complex structure ε = i dλ ⊗ ∂λ − i d¯λ ⊗ ∂¯λ on CP 1.

Twistor space Z of R4 is the bundle π : Z → R4 of complex structures on R4 associated with the
principal SO(4)-bundle of orthogonal frames of R4 [1]. It means that the ﬁbre π−1(x) of Z → R4
over a point x ∈ R4 coincides with the space CP 1 of complex structures on R4 deﬁned above. The
space Z is the trivial bundle over R4 with the ﬁbre CP 1, hence Z = R4 × CP 1 is a manifold which
can be covered by two coordinate patches:

Z = U+ ∪ U−, U+ := {x ∈ R4, λ ∈ C+}, U− := {x ∈ R4, λ ∈ C−}

with the intersection

Let us denote the cover (6) by U.

U := U+ ∩ U− = {x ∈ R4, λ ∈ Cα = C+ ∩ C−}.

The twistor space Z is a complex manifold with the complex structure J = (J, ε) on Z. Vector
ﬁelds ¯V¯1, ¯V¯2 from (5) and ¯V¯3 = ∂¯λ are the vector ﬁelds on Z of type (0, 1) with respect to the
complex structure J .

3 The Penrose-Ward correspondence

3.1. Complex vector bundle ˜E over the twistor space. Let E = P ×SU (n) Cn be a complex
vector bundle associated to P . Sections of this bundle are Cn-valued functions depending on x ∈ R4.
By using the projection π : Z → R4, we can pull back the bundle E with the connection
D = dxµDµ to the bundle ˜E := π∗E over Z = R4 × CP 1. By deﬁnition of the pull back, the pulled
back connection ˜D := π∗D will be ﬂat along the ﬁbres CP 1
x of the bundle Z → R4 and, therefore,
the components of ˜A := π∗A along the vector ﬁelds ∂λ, ∂¯λ in CP 1
x can be set equal to zero. Then
we have ˜D = D + dλ∂λ + d¯λ∂¯λ.

Local sections of the complex vector bundle ˜E are Cn-valued functions deﬁned on open subsets

of Z = R4 × CP 1.

3.2. Linear system for the SDYM equations and holomorphic bundles. Let ˜D(0,1)
(a =
1, 2, 3) be components of ˜D along the (0, 1) vector ﬁelds ¯V¯a on Z. A section ξ of the bundle ˜E is
called a local holomorphic section if it is a local solution of the equations ˜D(0,1)
ξ = 0 or, in local
coordinates on Z,

¯a

(8)

(D¯y − λDz)ξ(x, λ, ¯λ) = 0,
(D¯z + λDy)ξ(x, λ, ¯λ) = 0,
∂¯λξ(x, λ, ¯λ) = 0.

The equations ˜D(0,1)
ξ = 0 on sections ξ of the complex vector bundle ˜E deﬁne a holomorphic
structure in ˜E. Accordingly, the bundle ˜E is said to be holomorphic if eqs.(7),(8) are compatible,
i.e. the (0,2) components of the curvature of the bundle ˜E are equal to zero.

¯a

The solution of eq.(8) is ξ(x, λ). Equations (7) on ξ(x, λ) are called the linear system for the
SDYM equations [4, 17]. It is easy to see that the compatibility conditions of the linear system (7)
coincide with the SDYM equations written in the complex coordinates y, z, ¯y, ¯z on R4 ≃ C2.

Equations (7) have local solutions ξ±(x, λ) over U± ⊂ Z, and ξ+ = ξ− on U = U+ ∩ U− (for
deﬁnitions of U± and U see (6)). We can always represent ξ± in the form ξ± = ψ±χ±, where ψ±

3

are matrices of fundamental solutions of (7) deﬁning a trivialization of ˜E over U±, and χ± ∈ Cn
are ˇCech ﬁbre coordinates satisfying ¯V¯aχ± = 0 and χ− = Fχ+ on U = U+ ∩ U− ⊂ Z. The matrix
− ψ+ is the transition matrix in the bundle ˜E, i.e. holomorphic SL(n, C)-valued function
F = ψ−1
on U with non-vanishing determinant satisfying the conditions on transition matrices [8].

3.3. Ward’s theorem. So, starting from the complex vector bundle E over R4 with the self-
dual connection D, we can construct the holomorphic vector bundle ˜E over Z with the transition
matrix F = ψ−1

− ψ+ deﬁned on U ⊂ Z.

Conversely, if we are given the holomorphic vector bundle ˜E = ˜P (Z, SL(n, C)) ×SL(N,C)
Cn
associated to the principal ﬁbre bundle ˜P over Z, which is holomorphically trivial on each ﬁbre
CP 1
x the transition matrix F
can be factorized in the form (Birkhoﬀ’s theorem):

x × Cn (Ward’s twistor construction [17]), then on CP 1

x : ˜E |CP 1

x ≃ CP 1

F = ψ−1

− (x, λ)ψ+(x, λ),

where ψ±(x, λ) are SL(n, C)-valued functions holomorphic in λ±1 on C±.

From the holomorphicity of F on U ( ¯V¯aF = 0) it follows that ( ¯V¯aψ+)ψ−1

+ = ( ¯V¯aψ−)ψ−1

− and,

therefore,

(∂¯yψ+ − λ∂zψ+)ψ−1
(∂¯zψ+ + λ∂yψ+)ψ−1

+ = (∂¯yψ− − λ∂zψ−)ψ−1
+ = (∂¯zψ− + λ∂yψ−)ψ−1

− = −(A¯y(x) − λAz(x)),

− = −(A¯z(x) + λAy(x)),

and the potentials {Aµ} deﬁned by (10) satisfy the SDYM equations and do not change after trans-
formations: ψ± 7→ ψ±h±, where h± are regular holomorphic matrix-valued functions on U±. This
means that the bundles with transition matrices h−1

− Fh+ and F are holomorphically equivalent.

Let us summarize the facts about the Penrose-Ward correspondence in the theorem:

Theorem [2, 1]. There is a one-to-one correspondence between gauge equivalence classes of solu-
tions to the SDYM equations in the Euclidean 4-space and equivalence classes of holomorphic vector
bundles ˜E over the twistor space Z, which are holomorphically trivial over each real projective line
CP 1

x in Z.

Inﬁnitesimal gauge-type symmetries

4.1. The algebras C 0(U, H) and C 1(U, H). We consider the principal ﬁbre bundle ˜P =
˜P (Z, SL(N, C)) over the twistor space Z and the associated bundle Ad ˜P = ˜P ×Ad SL(n,C) sl(n, C)
with the adjoint action of the group SL(n, C) on the algebra sl(n, C): ξ 7→ Adgξ = gξg−1,
g ∈ SL(n, C), ξ ∈ sl(n, C). Let H be a sheaf of germs of holomorphic sections of the bundle
Ad ˜P (for deﬁnition see [8]), Γ(U, H) be a set of all sections of the sheaf H over an open set
U ⊂ Z.

A collection {ϕ+, ϕ−} of sections of H over the open sets U+ and U− from (6a) is called a
0-cochain over Z, subordinate to the cover U = {U+, U−}. Thus, a 0-cochain is an element of the
space

C 0(U, H) := Γ(U+, H) ⊕ Γ(U−, H).

The space of 1-cochains with values in H

C 1(U, H) := Γ(U, H)

is a set of sections ϕ of the sheaf H over U = U+ ∩ U−. Notice that C 0(U, H) and C 1(U, H) are
Lie algebras of holomorphic maps: U± → sl(n, C) and U → sl(n, C) respectively with pointwise
commutator.

4.2. Action of C 1(U, H) on transition matrices. The standard action of the algebra

C 0(U, H) on the space of holomorphic transition matrices F:

δF = ϕ−F − Fϕ+

gives us holomorphically equivalent bundles. Hence, these transformations are trivial. But we shall
consider the action of the algebra C 1(U, H) on F:

δϕF = ϕ(λ)F − Fϕ†(−

¯λ

),

(11)

where ϕ ∈ C 1(U, H), ϕ = ϕ(λ) ≡ ϕ(y − λ¯z, z + λ¯y, λ), ϕ(−1/¯λ) ≡ ϕ(y + ¯z/¯λ, z − ¯y/¯λ, −1/¯λ), and
† denotes Hermitian conjugation.

Transformations (11) preserve the holomorphicity of F and preserve the hermiticity of the

bundle E; they are local inﬁnitesimal transformations of the transition matrix.

4.3. Inﬁnitesimal gauge-type transformations of self-dual connections. Let us intro-

duce the sl(n, C)-valued smooth function φ on U :

φ := ψ−(δϕF)ψ−1

+ = ψ−ϕ(λ)ψ−1

The splitting φ = φ− − φ+ is a solution of the inﬁnitesimal variant of the Riemann-Hilbert problem,
and functions φ± ∈ sl(n, C) are holomorphic in λ ∈ C±. It follows from (10) that ˜D(0,1)
φ = 0, and,
therefore,

{Aµ} is given by the formulae

δϕψ+ = −φ+ψ+, δϕψ− = −φ−ψ−,

δϕA¯y − λδϕAz = D¯yφ+ − λDzφ+ = D¯yφ− − λDzφ−,
δϕA¯z + λδϕAy = D¯zφ+ + λDyφ+ = D¯zφ− + λDyφ−.

where S1 = {λ ∈ CP 1 : |λ| = 1}. Thus, we have described the action of C 1(U, H) on the space of
solutions of SDYM equations.

Example 1. For ϕ = 0 we have φ = 0. Choose φ+ = φ− = ϑ(x), x ∈ R4, then formulae (15)

give us manifest gauge symmetries (2).

Example 2. If we choose ϕ = ϕ(λ) (i.e. ∂µϕ(x, λ) = 0), then obtain the action of the algebra

su(n) ⊗ C[λ, λ−1] on the space of solutions of the SDYM equations [14].

Inﬁnitesimal diﬀeomorphism-type symmetries

5.1. The algebra C 0(U, V). Let us consider the complexiﬁed tangent bundle T C(Z) = T (1,0)(Z)⊕
T (0,1)(Z) of the twistor space Z and the sheaf V of germs of holomorphic sections of the bundle
T (1,0)(Z). The set of all sections of the sheaf V over an open set U ⊂ Z is denoted by Γ(U, V). If
we take sections of V over each of the open sets U+ and U− from the cover U, then the resulting
collection of holomorphic vector ﬁelds is called a 0-cochain over Z, subordinate to the cover U.
Thus, a 0-cochain {η+, η−} is an element of the space

C 0(U, V) := Γ(U+, V) ⊕ Γ(U−, V).

The space of 1-cochains is deﬁned as follows: C 1(U, V) := Γ(U, V), where U = U+ ∩ U−. Thus,
elements of C 1(U, V) are holomorphic vector ﬁelds η+− deﬁned on U .

5.2. Action of C 0(U, V) on transition matrices. The vector space C 0(U, V) can be described
as the Lie algebra of holomorphic vector ﬁelds with pointwise commutator, deﬁned on U+ and U−.
For any η = {η+, η−} ∈ C 0(U, V) we deﬁne two actions of C 0(U, V) on the transition matrix F as
follows:

δ±
η F = η±(F),

(16)

i.e. as a derivative of F along the vector ﬁelds η± ∈ C 0(U, V).
One can also consider a combination of these actions:

δηF = δ−

η F − δ+

η F.

It is easy to see that the algebra C 0(U, V) acts on the algebra C 1(U, H) by derivations, and we can
consider a semidirect sum C 0(U, V) ∔ C 1(U, H) of these algebras.

5.3. Action of C 0(U, V) on self-dual connections. Let us introduce the sl(n, C)-valued

smooth functions θ± on U

which are holomorphic in λ ∈ Cα:

θ± := ψ−(δ±

Example 3. Let us consider the holomorphic vector ﬁelds η = λ−n ˜N on U ⊂ Z, n =
0, ±1, ±2, ..., , where ˜N are vector ﬁelds on Z realizing the action of so(5, 1) on Z, which pre-
serves the holomorphicity of the bundle ˜E → Z. Such lift N → ˜N of vector ﬁelds from R4 to Z
was described in [10]. As it has been shown in [9], symmetries (20) for η = λ−n ˜N with n ≥ 0 are
in one-to-one correspondence with the symmetries from [13].

6 Conclusion

To sum up, using the one-to-one correspondence between the classes of holomorphically equivalent
transition matrices F and the gauge equivalent classes of self-dual connections, to any inﬁnitesimal
transformations (11) and (16) of transition matrices we have associated the inﬁnitesimal transfor-
mations (15) and (20) of solutions {Aµ} to the SDYM equations. There are no other inﬁnitesimal
automorphisms of the bundle ˜E over Z besides those generated by the algebras C 0(U, V) and
C 1(U, H). Thus, an inﬁnite-dimensional algebra of all inﬁnitesimal transformations of solutions to
the SDYM equations has the form C 0(U, V) ∔ C 1(U, H).

Notice that all the results of this paper may be generalized to the case of the SDYM equations
in 4n-dimensional spaces considered e.g.
in [19]. It would be interesting to generalize our results
to other SDYM-type equations in dimension greater than four (see e.g. [20]), various modiﬁcations
of which arise in string and membrane theories (see e.g. [21] and references therein).

A COSMIC ARCHIPELAGO: MULTIVERSE SCENARIOS IN 
THE HISTORY OF MODERN COSMOLOGY 

 
ABSTRACT: Multiverse scenarios are common place in contemporary  high energy physics and cosmology, although 
many consider them simply as bold speculations. In any case there is nothing like a single theory or a unified model of 
the multiverse. Instead, there are innumerable theoretical proposals often reciprocally incompatible. What is common to 
all  these  scenarios  is  the  postulated  existence  of  many  causally  disjointed  regions  of  space/time  (if  not  completely 
separated space-times) and the consideration of the observable universe as atypical in a global perspective. This paper 
examines  the  history  of  modern  cosmology  focusing  on  the  forerunners  of  current  ideas,  and  shows  how  some 
fundamental issues tend to present themselves on increasingly deeper levels of physical knowledge. 
 
“Is  it  unavoidable  to  speak  of  these  universes 
with  different  number  of  particles 
and 
(therefore!?)  natural  constants  and  h?  That  must 
be  avoidable.  If  a  theory  presents  the  possibility 
of  conceiving  a  theoretical  deduction  of  the 
actual number of particles, i. e. of deducing, that 
N  needs  to  be  what  it  is,  this  theory  must  be 
capable  of  being  described  without  using 
universes  with  an  arbitrary  number  of  particles. 
this  almost 
And  I  think,  quite  apart  from 
selfcontradictory procedure, it would greatly help 
the  understanding  to  avoid  the  necessity  of 
conceiving other universes than the actual one1”. 
 
“The idea that  multiple domains  may  exist  takes 
the  Copernican  revolution  to  its  ultimate  limit  - 
even  our  universe  may  not  be  the  center  of  the 
Universe2.”  
 

1.INTRODUCTION 

 
The 63th Symposium of the International Astronomical Union, held in Cracow on September 1973, 
was  largely  dedicated  to  cosmological  issues  deriving  from  the  general  relativistic  hot  big  bang 
(HBB)  model  of  the  universe3.  It  was a logical choice  if  one  thinks that  in  that  period,  especially 
after the publication of textbooks by Peebles and Weinberg4, the HBB had been canonized as the 
paradigmatic standard model of scientific cosmology. 
On the other hand, it could appear a little bit surprising that at this same symposium at least three 
different participants referred to the possible existence of many universes distinct from our own. 
Gary Steigman invoked “an ensemble of very many possible universes” in order to throw light on 
the  excess  of  particles  over  antiparticles  in  our  universe5,  while  Hawking  spoke  of  “conceivable

the  relic  radiation,  the  origin  of  structure  in  the  expanding  universe,  the  structure  of  singularities,  and  the  physical 
processes near a singularity … the choice between open and closed models, the non uniform distribution of matter (in 
particular, the clustering of galaxies), the origin of galaxies, and the rotation and magnetic fields of galaxies”.

universes”6(cid:1)while repeating the results of a recent paper (written jointly with Collins) dedicated to 
an explanation of the observed isotropy of the universe along the lines suggested by Robert Dicke 
and Brandon Carter7. 
The “Dicke/Carter philosophy”8 was indeed presented in Cracow by Carter himself9, who, upon the 
invitation  of  Wheeler,  exposed  a  “line  of  thought”  developed  by  him  over  the  last  seven  years10, 
finally  introducing  the  term  “anthropic”  to  re-name  what  was  previously  called  the  “principle  of 
cognizability”11. 
In  its  strong  form, the anthropic  principle  was  then associated  with an  ensemble  of  universes  and 
exploited  to  show  how  certain  numerical  coincidences,  which  depend  critically  “on  the  actual 
values of fundamental or microphysical constants”12 (such as Sciama’s relation between the average 
density  and  the  square  of  Hubble  constant  at  the  present  time13  or  the  peculiar  weakness  of  the 
gravitational  constant),  were  indeed  predictable  without  deserting  conventional  physics  and 
cosmology. Carter considered the constants of nature as operators in an Everett/Hilbert space where 
“an  ensemble  of  universes  characterized  by  all  possible  combinations  of  initial  conditions  and 
fundamental constants” was represented14. 
To postulate the “existence” of such an ensemble could appear a bold move open to different kinds 
of  objections,  but  according  to  Carter  it  did  not  bring  “very  much  further  than  the  Everett 
doctrine”15  which  represents  “the  only  interpretation  of quantum  theory  …  which  makes sense  in 
cosmological contexts”16. 
In the late 1960’s and early 1970’s the three above mentioned contributions were accompanied by 
others  of a  similar  kind or  in  any  case  discussing  a  “multiverse” concept17.  Among  these  we  find 
Bryce Seligman de Witt’s presentation of Everett’s relative state formulation of quantum mechanics 
in  terms  of  a  “continual  splitting  of  the  universe  into  a  multitude  of  mutually  unobservable  but

equally real worlds”, which is perhaps the best known and the most controversial18; Wheeler’s ideas 
on  superspace19  and  about  the  cyclical  universe20;  Tryon’s  thesis  concerning  the  creation  of  the 
universe  out  of  nothing21;  Thomas  Gold’s  proposal  of  “other  universes  nesting  within  our 
observable space” in the form of closed subunits appearing “as very small areas of great redshift”22; 
Reinhard  Breuer’s  and  Michael  Ryan’s  suggestion  of  “other  metagalaxies”  surrounding  our  own 
“within  a  larger  universe”23  and  Tullio  Regge’s  attempts  to  justify  some  dimensionless  numbers 
invoking “other universes”24. 
Although  there  are  relatively  few  physicists  in  the  first  half  of  the  1970’s  ready  to  speculate  on 
many  universes,  amongst  them  we  can  find  eminent  names  and  scholars  who  almost  certainly 
influenced  the  generations  to  come.  Their  pioneering  works  represented  the  prelude  of  a  trend 
which  assumed  larger  proportions  in  the  early  1980’s,  when  the  elaboration  of  concepts  such  as 
those  of  phase  transitions  and  spontaneous  symmetry  breaking  threw  new  light  on  the  role  of 
intrinsically  random  processes  in  the  very  early  universe25.  The  possibility  that  fundamental 
properties  of  the  universe,  including  the  dimensionality  of  space/time  and  the  values  of  the 
fundamental constants, might have a probabilistic origin was then seriously considered, opening the 
doors to speculations about other regions, bubbles, domains, branches, pocket-universes or simply 
“universes”. 
Cosmologists were since then motivated to theorize beyond the standard model for reasons which 
span  from  private  facts  (such  as  a  “feeling  of  excitement”26  or  the  need  to  publish  in  an  ever 
expanding  global  flourishing  of  new  publications  and  new  media)  to  undoubtedly  more  cogent 
motives. Among the latter we should maybe include:

the  need  to  solve  the  open  problems  of  the  HBB  model  (beginning  with  the  problems  of 
flatness and horizon, which were already known in the late 1960’s27, but which were largely 
appreciated after the 1979 paper by Dicke and Peebles  28 and which then generated Guth’s 
inflationary model29) 
the need to explore the physics of the very early universe, going beyond the standard models 
of both cosmology and elementary particles (and developing new mathematical techniques 
while facing the extreme conditions between the hadron era and Planck time)

the need to point to several broader scenarios endorsing the principle of plenitude30 (at the 
same time confronting ideas, principles or beliefs which have a long history behind them) 
the need to solve the problem of fine tuning 

 
The apparent “fine tuning” of many physical and cosmological quantities in the observed region of 
the universe represents indeed a major conundrum. It seems, in fact, that the existence of all kinds 
of  complexity  (including,  of  course,  intelligent  life)  fundamentally  depends  on  the  “delicate 
balance”  between  the  values  of  several  physical  and  cosmological  quantities  (from  parameters  of 
the standard model and fundamental physical constants31 to the dramatic case of the cosmological 
constant,  which  is  roughly  120  orders  of  magnitude  smaller  than  the  value  that  particle  theorists 
would expect32). This puzzling situation constitutes one of the main motivations for the connection 
between  multiverse  scenarios  and  “anthropic  reasoning”33.  In  short,  it  does  not  matter  how 
improbable the values of physical and cosmological fundamental quantities are a priori, since we 
must necessarily live in one of the universes that allows life. 
Both anthropic reasoning and many universes have become common occurrence nowadays. But this 
means  that,  as  in  the  case  of  the  anthropic  principle(s)34,  the  appeal  to  the  multiverse  concept 
implies a rather chaotic state of affairs, which includes different and often incompatible scenarios. 
Paraphrasing  John  Earman35,  one  could  say  that  the  multiverse  is  not  a  single  and  unified 
conception  but  rather  a  complicated  network  of  theoretical  proposals  or  speculations  which  are 
often in reciprocal antagonism. 
As  a  matter  of  fact,  in  the  current  literature  one  can  find  very  different  kinds  of  multiverses  and 
innumerable mechanisms to generate them (as for instance: oscillations, quantum world-splitting or 
other forms of foliation of Hilbert space, quantum vacuum fluctuations, symmetry breaking bubbles 
production,  chaotic  distributed  scalar  fields,  inflaton’s  fields,  wormholes,  Smolin’s  black  holes, 
random  difference  of  chaotic  gauge  theories,  moduli  space  of  solutions  of  a  supersymmetric  M-

                                                 
30 According to Arthur O. Lovejoy (who does not forget God’s Creative omnipotence) the theorem of plenitude states 
that all the conceptual possibilities must be realized. Cf. Lovejoy, A.: The Great Chain Of Being: A Study of the History 
of an Idea, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. 1936.

35  Earman  wrote  that  the  anthropic  principle  “is  not  a  single,  unified  principle  but  rather  a  complicated  network  of 
postulates, techniques, and attitudes“ (Earman, J.: The SAP also rises: a critical examination of the anthropic principle, 
American  Philosophical  Quarterly  24,  1987,  p.  307-317,  on  p.  307).  Cf.  John  Leslie’s  statement  according  to  which: 
“there  is  just  no  single  correct  way  of  counting  universes  and  thus  of  distinguishing  them  from  mere  regions  or 
locations” (Leslie, J.: Universes, Routhledge, London 1989, p. 135). 

theory, primordial antimatter domains at high redshifts36, … not to speak of the idea of producing 
universes  in  the  laboratory  through  “a  small  region  of  false  vacuum”37,  of  cosmic  organism’s 
theories38 or of the suggestion concerning fake “ simulated universes” indistinguishable from real 
ones in the eyes of their virtual inhabitants39). Moreover universes can generally differ not only in 
size or free parameters typical of the HBB model, but also in strength of elementary forces, masses 
of  elementary  particles,  gauge  symmetries,  vacuum  energy  densities  (i.e.:  values  of  the 
cosmological  constant),  metric  signatures,  dimensionality  and  so  on,  thus  frustrating  almost  any 
attempt of looking for an accurate taxonomy of the existing multiverse scenarios40. 
Apart from all this, it seems that what is common to all the many universes consists in two essential 
elements:  a  causal  separation  between  the  universes  and  a  probabilistic  basis  to  establish  what  is 
typical  or  atypical  to  the  whole  ensemble.  Both  such  elements  appear  relatively  clear  until  one 
decides to scrutinize them more closely. 
For instance, what is intended when mentioning causally disjointed universes? Probably regions of 
space/time which are beyond the horizon now (admitted that ”now” could have a meaning outside 
of  the  hypersurface  of  simultaneity  of  an  homogeneous  universe)?  Or,  rather,  domains  that  will 
remain forever disconnected? Or separated space/times that do not have a common causal origin in 
the past?41 It is clear that many of the regions pictured in proposals which are commonly presented 
as  multiverse  scenarios  are  indeed  parts  of  a  unique  space/time  and  thus  locally  causally  related; 
nevertheless, we  have  reason  to  affirm  that  if  regions  of space/time  are unobservable  and  beyond

succession  of single worlds in time -the simultaneous co-existence  of worlds within other worlds -the co-existence of 
separated  (and  physically  different)  worlds  within  an  infinite  imaginary  void  space.  The  classic  source  on  Medieval 
cosmology  remains:  Duhem,  P.:  Medieval  Cosmology:  Theories  of  Infinity,  Place,  Time,  Void,  and  the  Plurality  of

41  These  questions  resemble  Hermann  Bondi’s  distinction  of  three  possible  meanings  of  the  term  “universe”:  a)  the 
totality of all objects to which physical theory can be applied whether these objects are observable or not; b) all objects 
that  are  observable  now  or  at  any  time  in  the  future;  c)  all  objects  that  are  now  observable.  Cf.  Bondi,  H.:  Some

in 

testability, they can then be considered as effectively disjointed (especially if one supposes that they 
present different physical and/or cosmological properties with regard to our observable region). 
It  is  then  very  hard  to  say  what  makes  a  member  of  an  ensemble  of  universes  typical.  What  we 
generally  do  is  to  postulate  the  existence  of  typical  outcomes  in  order  to  conclude  that  our 
observable region is atypical (although it remains possibly typical within an anthropic subset42). 
The point is that one has no sure criteria to state what is common to every member of an ensemble, 
not even if one limits oneself to an anthropic subset. How do we delimitate such an ensemble? One 
can only presume that we have exhausted all the possibilities without being absolutely certain that 
this is the case. 
In other words, a big problem of multiverse scenarios consists in defining a measure of probability 
over  the  members  of  an  ensemble  of  universes,  i.e.  a  measure  indispensable  to  calculate 
probabilities concerning the parameters under scrutiny43. 
In practice, technical papers have limited themselves to probability distributions of one (or at most 
two44) parameters, posing convenient assumptions while nothing is said of more general cases. 
Anyway, the present paper does not aim to discuss epistemological issues neither is it interested in 
analysing contemporary multiverse proposals. What it, however, intends to show are the historical 
antecedents of current scenarios. 
 

2.MANY UNIVERSES IN PRE-RELATIVISTIC PHYSICS AND 
ASTRONOMY 

 
The  expression  “island  universes”  appeared  frequently  in  astronomical  debates  from  the  times  of 
Lord Rosse to the years of the Great Debate between Curtis and Shapley. At any rate, this important 
chapter  in  the  history  of  astronomy  is  of  meagre  relevance  to  our  current  discussion.  The  “island 
universes” dispute, in fact,  essentially dealt with the nature and collocation of those spiral nebulae 
which  were  observed  copiously  since  William  Herschel45.  The  point,  as  everyone  knows,  was  to 
establish if objects of such a kind were remote islands of stars comparable in size to our Milky Way 
or  if,  on  the  contrary,  they  were  mere  subunits  of  our  own  Galaxy.  In  the  latter  case,  which  was 
considered  orthodox  at  the  turn  of  XIX  century,  the  Milky  Way  was  generally  seen  as  a  finite 
aggregate  of  stars  immersed  in  an infinite  Euclidean  space  and  this  fundamental  “Architecture  of 
the Heavens”46 was treated as the Universe in its own right47. 
Nevertheless, the debate on the nature of the Nebulae stimulated a long series of speculations about 
very  remote  and  unobservable  outer  universes.  Whatever  the  nature  of  the  observed  Nebulae,

imagining the existence of other universes of stars which are very far away (possibly so far away to 
have  no  influence  on  our  neighbourhoods)  was  indeed  an  almost  inevitable  consequence  of  the 
principle of plenitude. 
In  an  epoch  of  strong  positivism,  when  observability  was  synonymous  with  scientific  existence, 
these bold speculations were generally relegated outside the circles of professional astronomers. It 
is not, therefore, surprising if very early suggestions of multiverse scenarios are the products of men 
of letters or amateurs who were free of speculating beyond the “observed facts”. 
Think, for instance, of Poe’s lectures on cosmology which were printed in 1848. The famous essay, 
Eureka-A  Prose  Poem48,  was  presented  by  its  author  as  a  “book  of  truths”  dedicated  to  dreamers 
and contained numerous insights which appear almost prophetical in retrospect. 
Once  the  description  of  our  universe  as  a  “cluster  of  clusters”  governed  by  unitary  laws  and 
subjected to a peculiar evolutionary history had been introduced, the American writer depicted “an 
interminable  succession  of  “clusters  of  clusters”,  or  of  “Universes”  more  or  less  similar”.  He 
declared that such a possibility was just a “fancy”, but at the same time stated that: 
 
“If such clusters of clusters exist, however -- and they do -- it is abundantly clear that, having had no part in 
our  origin,  they  have  no  portion  in  our  laws.  They  neither  attract  us,  nor  we  them.  Their  material  --  their 
spirit is not ours -- is not that which obtains in any part of our Universe. They could not impress our senses 
or our souls. Among them and us -- considering all, for the moment, collectively -- there are no influences in 
common. Each exists, apart and independently, in the bosom of its proper and particular God”. 
 
Contemporary  scholars  have  seen  an  anticipation  of  the  idea  of  causally  disjointed  universes  in 
these  lines,  recognizing  in  Poe’s  words  a  clear  suggestion  of the  existence  of other  cosmoi  rather 
than of other galaxies49. 
A  fashionable  book  such  as  Eureka  was  probably  perceived  as  a  product  of  imagination  by 
astronomers of the second half of XIX century, but the absence of a causal connection was a theme 
that occasionally arose within some of the many debates concerning the nature of aether. 
In a popular exposition, the Lezioni di Astronomia, published in 1877 by Giuseppe Barilli (who was 
in the habit of signing his books under the name of Quirico Filopanti) one can find mention of the 
existence of “innumerable Cosmoi, physically segregated from each other and from ours”. Filopanti 
was almost certain of their existence, although it was impossible to detect them because of “the lack 
of an interposed aether” or - in other words – of a suitable medium apt to the transmission of light50. 
The  Italian  “popular  lecturer”  didn’t  exclude  that  some  fragments  of  such  remote  Cosmoi  could 
have occasionally travelled through the depth of space to our cosmic neighboorhood under the form 
of  bolides,  meteorites  or  other  wandering  astronomical  bodies  (a  topic  which  assumed  a  proper 
relevance  in  astronomical  debates  after  the  discovery  of  the  unusually  high  proper  velocities  of 
some  “roving  stars”51).  He  argued  moreover  that  our  position  within  the  Milky  Way  (thus

contemporary,  Padre  Angelo  Secchi,  rejected  anyway  such  an  absolute  vacuum  inviting  his  readers  to  “dream  not  of

surrounded by other stars and nebulae in every direction) favoured our existence with regard to the 
possible occurrence of cosmical catastrophes associated with colliding astronomical debris. 
Finally,  Filopanti  invited  his  contemporaries  to  use  the  term  “cosmos”  as  synonimous  of  the 
observable universe, while reserving the word “Universe” for that “supreme” infinite entity which 
includes all the innumerable Cosmoi. 
The idea of a cosmic “desert” devoid of ether and a scenario very similar to that described in the 
Lezioni d’Astronomia was presented some years later by the Irish astronomer John Ellard Gore and 
exploited  as  a  possible  resolution  of  Olber’s  paradox.  Still  in  the  1904  edition  of  his  Studies  in 
Astronomy, Gore found, indeed, reasons to describe our star system as  
 
“a limited universe, which is isolated by a dark and starless void from any other universes which may exist in 
the infinity of space beyond”52. 
 
Although  Filopanti’s  and  Gore’s  speculations  can  appear  today  as  marginal  contributions  in  a 
historical  perspective,  the  debates  which  arose  after  the  formulation  of  the  second  law  of 
thermodynamics represent a different case. In the first place because this law (or theorem, which is 
a  more  precise  translation  of  the  German  word  Hauptsatz)  included  the  whole  universe  since  the 
very beginning. As Clausius put it in 1868: 
 
“The more the universe approaches this limiting condition in which the entropy is a maximum, the more do 
the occasions of further changes diminish; and supposing this condition to be at last completely obtained, no 
further change could evermore take place, and the universe would be in a state of unchanging death”.53 
 
A big question left open by such a formulation of the second Hauptsatz concerned the actual state 
of  the  observed  world54. Given  enough  time (or  better  still the eternity  of time that many  authors 
were inclined to assume), why do our surroundings testify to a state of things which is very far from 
the  presumed  Heath  Death?  A  similar  question  was,  for  instance,  explicitly  posed  by  Johannes 
Gustav Vogt in the first book of a treatise entitled Die Kraft. Vogt asked: 
 
“Since  the  world  is  temporally  infinite,  why  has  this  limiting  condition  [of  maximum  entropy]  not  been 
reached a long time ago?”55 
 
If  one  wishes  to  avoid  recourse  to  very  special  initial  conditions  or  the  disturbing  idea  of  a 
beginning  of  the  whole  world  which  seems  to  blatantly  contradict  the  first  of  the  laws  of 
thermodynamics,  it  is  necessary  to  individuate  other  ways  out  of  this  problem.  A  distinctive 
solution  was  advanced  by  an  English  expert  in  kinetic  theory  responding  to  the  name  of  Samuel 
Tolver  Preston56  who,  in  1879,  compared  human  observers  to  a  Maxwell’s  demon  intent  on

Magazine (4) 35, 1868, p. 405/419 (on p. 419). 
54  Clausius  stressed  that  “the  present  condition  of  the  universe”  was  “still  very  far  removed”  from  the  limiting 
condition. He then remarked that “all such periods as we speak of as historical are but a very short span in comparison 
with the immeasurable periods that the universe requires for comparatively very slight modifications”.

obvious  alternative  consists  in  a  universe  of  finite  age  starting  in  a  very  special  state,  but  creation  and  special  initial 
conditions  were  unacceptable  for  Vogt  as  they  will  be  for  Boltzmann’s  mechanical  Weltbild.  Opposite  views  are

the 

the  actual  state  of 

reaching conclusions about the equilibrium temperature of a gas from the point of view of a single 
molecule57. Preston argued that the scale of the universe was simply “too big” for our standards and 
suggested that the region of the universe that we inhabit, with its „rather exceptional” concentration 
of hot luminous stars, was presumably atypical if seen in a truly global perspective. He suggested 
then  that  the  presence  of  regions  where  „the  conditions  necessary  for  life”  are  maintained  for 
periods  of  time  which  are  long  in  comparison  to  the  human  experience  are  consistent  with  the 
second  law,  recalling  that the fact  of  finding  ourselves  in  a  part  of the  universe  “where  the  mean 
temperature  of  the  component  matter  is  exceptionally  high”  reserves  no  surprise  if  one  considers 
that “from the fact of our being in existence, we must be in a part which is suited to the conditions 
of life”58. 
Preston’s explanation was accused of arousing „confusion of reasoning” and “unsoundness”, but the 
author  defended  his  perspective  affirming  that  it  was  “consistent  with  principles  which at  present 
prevail” and escaped succesfully from the “necessity of supposing that existing physical principles 
must have been violated in past time” 59. 
The  problem  of 
itself. 
Nothwithstanding  the  enormous  developments  that  characterized  the  fields  of  kinetic  theory  and 
statistical  mechanics  in  the  second  half  of  the  XIX  century  (especially  thanks  to  the  powerful 
mathematical techniques developed by Maxwell and Boltzmann), in 1894 Fitzgerald was still there 
to ask: 
 
“…  why  the  ether,  the  solar  system,  and  the  whole  universe  were  not  subject  to  the  Boltzmann/Maxwell 
law?”60 
 
As is well known, it was Boltzmann himself who provided an answer which fundamentally echoed 
Tolver Preston’s argument. 
From  1895  to  1898  the  Austrian  physicist  on  at  least  three  occasions  rejected  the  idea  of  a  very 
special beginning of the universe, presenting a cosmological scenario where “the whole universe is, 
and rests forever, in thermal equilibrium” although “here and there” relatively small isolated regions 
(which  he  called  Einzelwelten,  i.e.:  single  worlds,  imagining  them  to  have  „the  extension  of  our 
stellar  space”)  can  fluctuate  temporarily  from  that  state,  admitting  then  the  local  existence  of 
“visible motion and life”61. 
Assuming the universe was great enough, the fact that a “small part of it as our world should be in 
its present state” was in complete agreement with the probabilistic interpretations of entropy, since 

the  world  continued  anyway

Question regarding one of the Physical Premises upon which the Finality of Universal Change is based, Philosophical 
Magazine (5) 10, 1880, p. 338/342. An illuminating description of Tolver Preston’s scenario was the following: “Thus it 
appears  that  the  kinetic  theory,  applied  to  the  universe,  would  have  the  peculiar  characteristics  of  allowing  almost 
indefinite  local  fluctuations  of  temperature,  of  states  of  aggregation,  and  of  composition,  of  the  matter  forming  the 
universe  within  regions  very  extensive,  absolutely  speaking  (i.  e.,  in  comparison  with  the  boundless  universe),  these 
regions being amply extensive enough to allow an amount of activity and variability of energy adapted to the conditions 
of life; while at the same time the principles of the theory, from their very nature, involve perpetually recurring and yet 
indefinitely  variable  changes  within  certain  localised  limits,  the  constitution  of  the  vast  whole  (looked  at  broadly) 
remaining uniform throughout” (from p. 462 of Tolver Preston, S.: On the possibility of… 1879).

this  state  was  simply  very  improbable  (although  not  impossible)  all  the  same  remaining  a 
preliminary condition for the existence itself of living observers. 
Boltzmann  depicted  a  collection  [Inbegriff]  of  single  individual  worlds  reciprocally  separated  by 
thermically dead matter along spatial distances 10100 times larger than the actual distance of Sirius 
from the Sun (which is about 7 light years). But although such distances are impressively large even 
if considered in the light of contemporary standards, they still were not infinite (actual infinity, as 
we will see, is indeed a source of serious problems for probabilistic reasoning). 
The  re-proposal  of  the  Boltzmann  scenario  in  the  context  of  a  spatially  infinite  universe  was 
anyway a move that Boltzmann’s heirs were ready to fulfil, and remains indeed a fundamental step 
for contemporary multiverse conceptions62. 
Although  the  problem  of  the entropy  of  the  universe  has passed  through  drastic  changes  after  the 
adoption of general relativity, the search for an alternative to very special initial conditions of the 
whole  world  remained  a  major  issue  in  modern  cosmology.  The  Preston/Boltzmann’s  scenario  at 
the same time did represent a prototype for the elaboration of both inhomogeneous models and (still 
more)  for  all  those  cosmological  proposals  which  imply  the  co-existence  of  isolated  regions  of 
space/time characterized by peculiar physical properties (possibly conceived as stochastic outcomes 
of some fundamental process or event as, for instance, phase transitions in the very early universe). 
Tolman  and  Dingle’s  inhomogeneous  models  will  be  discussed  below,  but  let  me  immediately 
introduce  a  few  other  examples,  such  as  the  scenario  exposed  by  Grigory  Moiseevich  Idlis  in  a 
paper  of  1958  (entitled  Essential  features  of  the  astrophysical  observed  universe  as  typical 
properties  of  the  inhabited  cosmic  system63)  which  was  considered  by  Zel’dovich  as  the  first 
application of the anthropic principle in relativistic cosmology64. 
Openly  inspired  by  Boltzmann,  the  Russian  astronomer  presented  a  cosmological  scenario  where 
the  observed  part  of  the  universe  constituted  a  peculiar  region,  provided  with  the  properties 
necessary  for  the  rise,  evolution  and  maintenance  of  life,  contained  in  an  otherwise  infinite  and 
eternal universe which is inhomogeneous on a very large scale. He showed, in particular, that any

domains”. Moreover, he quoted Selety’s papers which will be discussed below. Cf. also: Treder H.J.: Relativity Theory

typical  inhabited  region  of  the  universe  would  have  shared  with  our  observable  expanding 
metagalaxy the fact of necessarily being an „isolated" region endowed with „characteristic features” 
such  as  an  appropriate  age,  expansion  rate,  average  density,  average  temperature,  and  chemical 
composition. 
Idlis  stated  that  there  was  no  reason  for  appealing  to  „anomalous  initial  conditions”  of  the  whole 
universe.  In  fact,  maintaining  that  living  beings  can  observe  only  regions  of  the  universe  that  do 
possess the properties of a typical inhabited system and not any region in the „infinite multiformity” 
of  the  universe,  he  declared  that  we  have  no  right  to  globally  extrapolate  the  properties  of  our 
observable region. 
Probably  Boltzmann’s  view  also  inspired  the  “radical  departure  from  the  ‘steady  state’  concept” 
which  was advanced  by  Hoyle  and  Narlikar  in  the  mid  1960’s  after  the  discovery  of  high  energy 
phenomena due to quasars or radiogalaxies that posed major difficulties to steady state cosmology 
with continuous creation of matter65. Hoyle and Narlikar aimed to prevent an initial singularity and 
attempted  to  explain  quasars  as  isolated  “pockets  of  creations”  associated  to  very  intense 
gravitational fields (in other words, as sources for the creation of new matter which act in a discrete 
way  rather  than  continuously  as  in  the  orthodox  steady  state  theory).  As  a  consequence,  they 
supposed that the universe should appear highly  inhomogeneous on a very large scale, presenting 
regions  of  different  average  density  which  are  expanding  faster  than  others  so  as  to  lower  or 
temporarily halt the creation rate within them. 
Hoyle and Narlikar then depicted the existence of bubbles with the size and mass of the observable 
universe,  suggesting  that  similar  bubbles  may  occur  at  any  place  and  time,  but  need  not  develop 
synchronously”; finally they argued that we live in a wide but temporary “fluctuation” which can be 
described as a flat expanding Einstein/de Sitter universe with its own physical phenomenology. 
Later,  Hoyle  insisted  on  an  alterative  explanation  of  the  cosmic  microwave  background  founded 
again  on  the  existence  of  an  infinite  and  globally  stationary  universe  which  is  on  average  much 
more  dense  than  the  observable  region  (in  agreement  with  the  observational  facts  concerning 
radiogalaxies).  Moreover,  he  underlined  that  the  fine  structure  and  other  fundamental  constants 
could indeed be different in other regions of the universe, remarking consequently the crucial role 
that “environmental effects" play in "our existence as living beings”.  
In 1965 Hoyle affirmed that 
 
“the universe would be far richer in its possibilities and content than we normally imagine. In other regions 
the  numbers  would  be  different  and  the  gross  properties  of  matter,  the  science  of  chemistry  for  example, 
would be entirely changed”66. 
 
while, eleven years later he imagined that 
 
“the  ultimate  future  of  the  physical  sciences  may  lie  not  so  much  in  unravelling  the  properties  of  our 
particular environment as in working through the possibilities permitted by all the kinds of environments that 
may exist in a universe of far greater complexity than we contemplate in our usual cosmological studies”67. 
 
In more recent times the Preston/Boltzmann’s scenario has then become common occurrence both 
in  eternal  inflation68  and  in  the  landscape  which  describes  the  space  of  all  the  possible  vacua

68  Eternal  inflation,  as  introduced  originally  by  Andrei  Linde,  invoked  self-reproducing  universes  in  order  to  avoid  a 
beginning  of the  universe. Cf.:  Linde, A.: Eternally Existing  Self-Reproducing Inflationary Universe, Physica Scripta 
T15,  p. 169/175, 1987;  Linde, A.-Linde, D.-Mezhlumian,  A.: From the  big  bang theory to the theory  of a  stationary 
universe,  Physical  Review  D49,  1994,  p.  1783/1826.  Linde’s  scenario,  where  the  universe  as  a  whole  is  past-eternal 
(i.e.: “immortal” in Linde’s works), was rejected by Borde and Vilenkin who demonstrated that “a physical reasonable 

according  to  string  theory.  In  the  first  case,  one  has  a  picture  of  post-inflationary  “thermalised 
islands” (which are multiple regions of space time, each provided of their own low energy constants 
and physical features) in an “inflating background of false vacuum”; in the latter, one contemplates 
a  scenario  of  at  least  10500  metastable  low-energy  vacua  produced  through  several  possible 
inflationary  mechanisms  (such  as  those  connected  with  eternal  inflation  itself)  and,  of  course, 
representing completely disjointed domains69. 
Both  eternal  inflation  and  the  landscape  scenario  imply,  therefore,  a  spatial  variation  of  the 
cosmological constant (an idea which was introduced in 1931 by the Swiss Gustave Juvet in order 
to support Shapley’s conviction that external spiral nebulae were smaller than the Milky Way, but 
which remained virtually unknown70) and promote an anthropic interpretation of the local value of 
that “constant” which resembles Boltzmann’s treatment. 
In all the above mentioned examples (Idlis, Hoyle, eternal inflation and the “landscape” proposal) 
we  can  indeed  conceive  the  presence  of  different  universes  as  separated  “islands”  in  the  same 
“ocean”71 and evaluate that our presence as observers is possible only in those regions which have 
the appropriate conditions for the emergence and development of complexity and life, despite the 
unlikely realization of such conditions. 
In a fairly significant way, the picture of “a cosmic archipelago”, which is now commonly adopted 
for  describing  the  “new concept”  of  the  multiverse72,  was  previously  presented  by  von  Humboldt 
together  with  the  expression  “island  universe”  (Weltinsel)73  and  then  adopted  by  John  Pringle 
Nichol, teacher of lord Kelvin and the main source of Poe’s visionary cosmology74. 
 

3.THE CLOSED UNIVERSE AND THE INFINITE WORLDS 

 
The  publication  of  Einstein’s  Kosmologische  Betrachtungen  in  1917  marks  the  birth  of  general 
relativistic  cosmology  or,  if  one  prefers,  of  the  modern  science  of  the  universe75.  Although 
Einstein’s main aim was then to find a satisfactory extension of his field equations consistent with 
his ideas on the nature of inertia (and with the consequent problem of the behaviour of the metric 
field  at  spatial  infinity),  the  result  of  his  inquiry  brought  him  to  picture  a  static  self-contained 
universe with closed space sections of constant curvature. 
Einstein, in any case, was not the first to apply Riemannian geometry in a cosmological perspective. 
From  Zöllner  to  Lense,  passing  from  Peirce,  Plassmann,  Schwarzschild,  Barbarin,  Harzer, 

                                                                                                                                                                 
spacetime which is eternal inflating to the future must possess an initial singularity” (Borde, A.-Vilenkin, A.: Eternal 
inflation  and  the  initial  singularity,  Physical  Review  Letters  72,  1994,  p.  3305/3309).  For  a  review  cf.:  Guth,  A.:

Frankland  and  others76,  many  authors  contributed  to  make  the  applications  of  non-Euclidean 
geometry  to  large  scale  astronomy  a  rather  usual  event  in  the  late  XIX  century77.  It  is  not  then 
surprising  to  find  that  Alexander  Moszkowsky,  in  his  controversial78  essay  published  in1921, 
discussed  along  with  Einstein  the  meaning  of  a  Riemannian  finite  universe  before  dealing  with  a 
topic such as that made popular by Zöllner’s and Slade’s speculations on an extradimensional world 
populated by spirits. 
In  this  circumstance,  Einstein  explained  patiently  to  Moszkowski  what  other  universes  should 
possibly  be  according  to  his  cosmological  model.  They  were  surely  not  to  be  conceived  as  other 
islands  of  stars  (a  possibility  that  Einstein  ignored  in  his  scientific  memoirs,  figuring  a  uniform 
distribution of stars, but that in any case would have not conducted outside the finite universe) but 
rather as “other universes” without any physical connection with our one (“andere Universen außer 
Zusammenhang  mit  diesem”)  and  “outside  from  whatever  investigable  connection”  (außer  einem 
jemals erforschbaren Zusammenhang) 79. 
Einstein’s  description  of  such  external  Ultra  Welten  was  not  dissimilar  from  many  popular 
expositions of non Euclidean Geometry of his day. In fact, Einstein explained that the conception of 
“another universe which proceeds parallel” (ein anderes parallel verlaufendes Universum) implied 
a “cosmic plan” whose “phenomena and relations” were destined to remain forever inaccessible to 
experiment and observations. In other words, he suggested that we were in the same position of the 
inhabitants of a two-dimensional Flatland which would have ignored forever the possible presence 
of a two dimensional world completely separated from theirs80. 
A similar picture had clearly a pedagogical function. In any case, it is not so conceptually different 
from  all  those  proposals  that  will  illustrate  the  co-existence  of  “universes”  in  some  sort  of 
superspace (as the Hilbert space invoked by the many worlds formulation of quantum mechanics or

S.: Popular Astronomy, ... 1878; Newcomb, S.: The philosophy of hyperspace, Bulletin of the American Mathematical 
Society (2) 4, 1898, p. 187/195. Riemann, on the other hand, remarked that speculations about the “ incommensurably 
great“  [Unmessbargrosse]  were  idle  [müssig]  (Riemann,  B.:  Über  die  Hypothesen,  welche  der  Geometrie  zu  Grunde 
liegen,  Abhandlungen  der  Königlichen  Gesellschaft  der  Wissenschaften  zu  Göttingen  13,  1867,  now  available  on. 
http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Geom/ ) while Clifford stated that the geometer knew “nothing 
about  the  nature  of  actually  existing  space  at  an  infinite  distance”  (Clifford,  W.K.:  The  Postulate  of  the  Science  of 
Space,  1873,  now  available  in:  http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/navigation/ideas/articles/clifford/index.shtml  ).  Finally, 
Maxwell  rejected  any  non-Euclidean  conceptions  attributing  them  to  “space  crumplers”  (postcard  to  Tait  of  1874, 
reproduced in Harman, P.H.: Energy, Force, and Matter. The Conceptual Development of Nineteenth-Century Physics,

extra-dimensions of space. On this last topic see: Bettini, S.: Immagini dell’Universo ..., 2001, part II, section 4.8 and

80 Compare Einstein’s example with the following remark by Newcomb: “Right around us, but in a direction which we 
cannot  conceive  any  more  than  the  inhabitants  of  ‘flat-land’  can  conceive  up  and  down,  there  may  exist  not  merely 
another universe, but any number of universes” (Newcomb, S.: Side-Lights…, 1906). 

jointly  with  Carter’s  strong  anthropic  principle),  by  Tegmark’s  level  3  parallel  universes81  or  by 
cosmological models as that proposed by Jaroslav Pachner in 1960. This last author suggested that 
 
“From  the  finite  radium  of  the  universe,  we  may  not  conclude  that  it  is  the  only  existing  one.  We  should 
suppose the existence of many closed universes so embedded into the "cosmical space of higher number of 
dimensions  than  four"  that  their  hypersurfaces  do  not  intersect  each  other.  Since  there  exists  no  physical 
interaction  under  them,  they  are  incapable  of  being  observed,  but  this  does  not  signify  that  they  do  not 
exist“82. 
 
Despite  these  future  developments,  Moszkowsky’s  collection  of  Einstein’s  thoughts  represents 
probably  nothing  more  than  a  simple  curiosity  although  it  maintains  a  certain  fascination  if  one 
thinks of the controversies which were raised by the idea of a curved finite universe and associated 
with the relativistic view of the world. 
Only de Sitter, Weyl, Felix Klein, Eddington, Lanczos and a few other scholars with competence in 
tensor calculus and general relativity were able to participate directly in that abstruse debate which 
followed the publication of Einstein’s Kosmologische Betrachtungen. Many scientists, however, felt 
the necessity to reject the idea itself of a finite universe in the name of the infinity of the world. 
Amongst  them  were  the  partisans  of  an  infinite  hierarchical  universe  composed  of  “a  boundless 
vista of worlds within worlds”83. 
Hierarchic  cosmology  and  the  scenario  of  a  succession  of  worlds  within  worlds  which  proceed 
indefinitely both in the direction of the infinitely large and of the infinitely small has a long history, 
which can be traced back to Pascal’s thought on the disproportion of man (which contemplated the 
image  of  “an  infinity  of  universes”  each  with  “its  own  firmament,  planets,  earth,  in  the  same 
proportion as the visible world”84) and to Leibniz metaphysics. The hierarchical conception of the 
system of the world knew then a notable diffusion with Lambert’s Cosmologische Briefe, an essay 
which was translated in English, French and Russian but which does not appreciate in any way the 
idea of an infinite world85. 
On the other hand, it was in order to face the problem of infinity that the historian of atomism Kurd 
Lasswitz  presented,  in  1877,  his  version  of  the  hierachic  scenario86.  He  suggested  that  the 
incomprehensibility  of  the  concept  of  infinity  was  due  to  an  incapacity  of  our  cognitive  faculty 
(unserer Erkenntnissfähigkeit) and discussed in depth the so called “relativity of magnitude”. 
The idea according to which “lengths, times and masses are reciprocally proportional in systems of 
different order, whereas relative velocities are the same”87 was truly fundamental in the formulation 
of Edmund Edward Fournier d’Albe’s version of hierarchic cosmology which was first presented in 
chapter XVI of The Electron Theory (1906) and, one year later, in a celebrated essay entitled Two 
New Worlds: The Infra World. The Supra World88.

that  model  after 

Inspired  by  the  “chemico-astronomical”  analogy  between  the  current  models  of  the  atom  and  the 
Solar  system,  Fournier  imagined  a  hierarchical  universe  where  each  level  was  1022  times  (i.e.: 
approximately the ratio between the diameter of the electron and that of the Earth) larger than the 
preceding one and consequently put forward a peculiar solution of Olbers’ paradox. Such a proposal 
was  greatly  appreciated  by  the  Swedish  astronomer  Carl  Vilhelm  Ludwig  Charlier  who  defined 
Fournier’s  book  of  1907  “ingenious”  and,  a  year  later,  elaborated  a  more  cogent  mathematical 
model for an infinite hierachical world not afflicted by Olbers’ and Seeliger’s paradoxes89. 
Charlier  further  elaborated 
the  publication  of  Einstein’s  cosmological 
considerations  animated  by  the  defense  of  “an  infinitely  extended  world”  and  by  the  need  to 
establish a quantitative “doctrine of infinite rarity of matter in space”90. In 1922, he advanced also a 
natural explanation for the observed recessional velocities of spiral nebulae. 
The scenario depicted by Charlier, where stars form Milky Ways, Milky Ways form a system of a 
higher order and so on indefinitely, was sometimes described as a sequence of “super-universes”91 
and  gave  rise  to  an  extreme  form  of  steady  state  cosmology.  In  Charlier’s  model,  in  fact,  the 
universe  appears  the  same  not  only  in  any  place  and  at  any  time  but  also  on  any  scale  (and  life, 
moreover, can be present at any level of the hierarchy). 
Einstein, at any rate, did not debate directly with Charlier but with the Austrian philosopher Franz 
Josef  Jeiteles  who,  after  having  changed  his  name  to  Franz  Selety  in  1918,  presented  in  1922  a 
further elaboration of the hierarchical cosmology in the form of a “world with molecular hierarchy” 
[molekularhierarchische Welt]92. 
Contrary to his predecessors, Selety paid genuine attention to the topics discussed in the circle of 
general  relativistic  experts  and  aimed  not  only  at  the  construction  of  a  non  contradictory  infinite 
Newtonian  universe  but  also  at  the  setting-up  of  an  infinite  hierarchical  model  compatible  with 
general  relativity  and  conceivable  as  an  alternative  to  Einstein’s  finite  universe.  Incidentally,  he 
adopted a pretty modern approach for his times, suggesting that cosmology had to pay attention not 
only to the structure of the actual world but also to the mathematically possible universes. 
Selety was indeed the first to conceive (two years before Friedmann’s second memoir) a consistent 
general relativistic open model with Euclidean space sections. 
In September 1922 Einstein dedicated one of his last interventions on cosmology of the 1920’s to 
reject  Selety’s  thesis93.  He  accepted  the  hierarchical  scenario  as  a  way  out  from  the  paradoxes  of 
Newtonian’s cosmology but then attacked both Charlier and Selety in a very unfortunate way, i.e. 
denying the empirical evidence of external galaxies. Moreover, Einstein affirmed that a world with 
molecular  hierarchy  was  compatible  with  general  relativity  but  unsatisfying  because  unable  to 
substantiate a material determination of inertia. At last the inventor of general relativity repeated his 
arguments  against  an  infinite  universe  already  discussed  in  his  Princeton’s  lectures  some  months 
before94.  In  short:  a  closed  surface  is  preferable  to  an  open  one  on  the  ground  of  simplicity95;

Mach’s  principle  implies a  spatially  closed  universe;  the  hypothesis of  a finite average  density  of 
matter is preferable to the request of an average density tending to 0. 
Selety disagreed with all these three arguments96. He rejected vigorously the conclusion according 
to  which  a  Riemannian  world  was  simpler  than  a  Minkowskian  one  and  defined  Einstein’s 
interpretation  of  Mach’s  ideas  just  a  mere  “opinion”.  In  favour  of  the  infinity  of  the  universe  he 
added then the concept of relativity of length; the possibility of a “cosmological satisfaction” of the 
principle  of  special  relativity  in  a  Minkowskian  context  and  the  observation  that  an  irregular 
distribution  of  matter  was  closer  to  the  actual  facts  than  the  uniform  distribution  assumed  in 
Einstein’s cosmology. 
In  any  case,  Selety  was one  of  the  few  defenders  of an  infinite  universe who  discussed this topic 
directly with Einstein. The large majority of those who invoked the infinity of the universe (from 
Arrhenius  to  Nernst,  passing  fromWiechert,  MacMillan  and  Charlier)  simply  cultivated  a  sort  of 
spontaneous hostility towards general relativity and its model building claims97. 
Amongst  them  was  Emile  Borel  who,  apart  from  disclosing  a  certain  sympathy  for  Charlier’s 
cosmology98,  proposed  on  a  couple  of  occasions  a  very  strong  argument  against  both  Einstenian 
cosmology  and  any  other  attempt  to  build  a  model  of  the  whole  universe99.  The  French 
mathematician argued in fact that, in a truly cosmological perspective, we are in the same position 
as tiny inhabitants of a drop of water: just as they would be unable to appreciate the complexity of 
the  world  outside  the  drop,  we  would  analogously  be  completely  on  the  wrong  track  in  trying  to 
extrapolate conclusions from the “visible universe” to the whole totality of things. 
Borel was surely inspired by Boltzmann’s approach to cosmology in stating that “local knowledge 
can’t  give  knowledge  of  the  universe”100  and  his  conclusions  represented  a  warning  for  any 
theoretical  attempt  aimed  to  extrapolate  beyond  what  is  observed  from  our  spatio/temporal 
collocation  (or,  in  other  words,  what  is  outside  of  our  past  light  cone).  Cosmology,  as  also  noted 
recently in several occasions, cannot avoid recourse to unverifiable assumptions, while the adoption 
of  principles  of  different  kinds  can  indeed  lead  to  very  different  conclusions  and  to  incompatible 
scenarios101. 
In any case, the possibility of a hierarchical universe (i.e. a cosmology  which does not accept the 
cosmological  principle  and  presupposes  an  infinite  space  with  null  average  density)  was  revived 

                                                                                                                                                                 
95  Einstein  justified this assertion  saying that  spatial infinity  involves a fourth rank tensor (i.e. the Riemann’s  tensor) 
which vanishes at infinity, whereas the gravitational filed of a closed space does not require more than a second rank 
tensor (cf. Einstein, A.: Vier Vorlesungen..., p. 64).

from time to time in the history of modern cosmology102. As an alternative to the homogeneous and 
isotropic  expanding  models,  it  represented  a  topic  often  discussed  by  Soviet  astronomers103, 
strongly supported by Gerard de Vaucouleurs in the 1970’s and brought back in vogue again in the 
form  of  the  so  called  “fractal  cosmology”.  Recent  proposals  cannot,  in  any  case,  maintain  the 
concept  of  relativity  of  magnitude  or  Fournier’s  scenario  of  worlds  within  worlds.  The  idea  of 
universes  within  atoms  is  clearly  untenable  in  the  light  of  contemporary  physics104,  although  one 
could be tempted to make a parallel with those recent speculations suggestimg that black holes are 
the cradles of new universes provided with their own physical phenomenology105. 
The topic of actual infinity is, instead, a recurring source for concern. It is, in fact, still common to 
find in literature a restatement of Kepler’s objection to the actual infinite (and of Bruno’s infinite 
worlds) according to which the existence of infinitely many planets would imply the presence of “as 
many  Galileos  observing  new  stars  in  new  worlds  as  there  are  worlds”.  The  existence  of 
doppelgänger  was  indeed  frequently  discussed  in  the  XIX  and  early  XX  centuries.  It  was,  for 
instance, cited by the socialist theorist and anti-positivist thinker Louis-Auguste Blanqui in an essay 
of 1872, L'éternité par les astres, which was later appreciated by both Benjamin and Borges. 
Blanqui reflected on the consequences of having an infinite number of stars and a finite number of 
“simple bodies” (i.e. our chemical elements106) and concluded that: 

“The number of our doubles is infinite in time and space. In all conscience, we can hardly ask for more. These 
doubles are of flesh and blood, or in pants and coats, in crinoline and chignon. These aren’t phantoms: they 
are the now eternalized. There is nevertheless a great defect: there is, alas, no progress! No, these are vulgar 
re-editions,  repetitions.  As  it  is  with  editions  of  past  worlds,  so  it  is  with  those  of  future  worlds.  Only  the 
chapter  of  bifurcations  remains  open  to  hope.  Never  forget  that  all  we  could  have  been  here,  we  are 
somewhere else”107. 

Similar conclusions were criticized by von Nägeli108, discussed by Engels109 and revived then in the 
debates on Nietzsche’s eternal return and Poincaré’s theorem110. Finally, they represented a subject

for cosmological speculations111. The point is that Blanqui’s problematic insight seems to maintain 
its validity also when one considers the open expanding universes of relativistic cosmology or the 
spatially infinite domains of some inflationary scenarios. This is at least what was claimed to have 
been  demonstrated  by  Ellis  and  Brundrit  for  open  isotropic  and  homogeneous  expanding 
universes112  and,  more  recently,  by  Garriga/Vilenkin  and  Knobe/Olum/Vilenkin  in  the  case  of 
inflationary models113. Barrow and Tipler have on their part remarked that an infinite repetition as 
that  imagined  by  Blanqui  requires  not  only  an  infinite  space  but  also  “an  exhaustively  random 
infinity in order to include all the possibilities”114. Despite this last warning115, it remains a rather 
common  occurrence  to  read  that  an  infinite  space  is  by  itself  sufficient  for  having  replicas  of 
ourselves somewhere in the universe116; while the duplication becomes that of whole universes (or 
better still: of an infinite number of regions “whose history is identical to ours”) once one considers, 
as  Garriga  and  Vilenkin  do,  that  “all  histories  consistent  with  exact  conservation  laws  will  have 
non-vanishing probabilities and will occur in an infinite number” of domains within the thermalised 
regions of certain inflationary models117.

Society  20,  p.  37/41.  Brundrit  and  Ellis  noted  that  with:  -an  infinite  number  of  galaxies  -a  finite  probability  of 
intelligent life evolving on other planets and -a finite number of different configurations of the DNA molecule, “there 
will be an infinite number of genetically identical beings in the Universe at any time”. At any rate, they remarked in a 
footnote that because an event can “occur in infinitely many planetary systems”, initial conditions must be “such that 
the probability of any event occurring is not vanishing”. The impression is that Ellis invoked the possibility of infinite 
duplication  in  order  to  reject  spatial  infinity.  In  other  papers  Ellis  resumes  the  old  argument  of  Christ’s  multiple 
incarnations (Ellis, G.F.R.: The Theology of the Anthropic Priniple, in: Quantum Cosmology and the Laws of Nature: 
Scientific  Perspectives  on  Divine  Action,  Russell,  R.J.-Murphy,  N.-Isham,  C.J.  (eds.),  Vatican  Observatory  1993,  p.

fact,  it  will  happen  an  infinite  number  of  times”  which  was  championed  by  Sciama118)  is 
philosophically  disturbing  for  all  those  that  still  tend  to  resuscitate  all  the  classical  arguments 
elaborated  to  deny  actual  infinity  from  Aristotle  to  Hilbert.  The  crux  of  the  matter  remains  the 
physical actual realization of an infinite universe with an infinite amount of mass/energy119. 
Expanding universes with constant negative curvature (which means infinite space sections if one 
assumes  trivial  topology120)    were  discussed  for  the  first  time  by  Friedmann121  in  1924  who 
attributed  them  an  “exceptional  interest”  (probably  of  the  same  grade,  if  not  greater,  of  that 
stimulated  by  the  non-stationary  solutions  of  the  field  equations  themselves)122.  Paradoxically 
enough, the open expanding model with Euclidean space sections became then a fundamental tool 
of cosmological enquiry thanks to a joint paper by Einstein and de Sitter123. 
Such  a  model,  the  so  called  Einstein/de  Sitter  universe,  was  conceived  when  the  two  founders  of 
general relativistic cosmology met each other in Pasadena on January 1932 and was then presented 
as a description of the relation between the expansion and the average density which could result 
theoretically useful “for the sake of simplicity”. 
Effectively, the monotonically expanding flat model with null curvature, average density always124 
equal to critical density ((cid:20) = 1) and no cosmological constant, surely represented “the simplest of 
all known universes”125. This despite the fact that one of its authors had declared just some years 
before  to  be  almost  sure  that  an  Euclidean  universe  was  too  complex  to  be  acceptable  and  that, 
furthermore, neither Einstein nor de Sitter ever lent much relevance to the 1932 paper126. 
Notwithstanding the 1932 paper, Einstein remained responsible for a widespread predilection of the 
closed universe; a predilection which was shared by many experts in general relativity in the years 
to come (such as Wheeler127 or Infeld, with the latter ready to consider Einstein/de Sitter’s model 
rough  and  unattractive128)  and  that  urged  others  to  discard  any  infinite  universe  as  beyond  the 
conception of the mathematicians themselves129 if not as “a scandal to human thought”130.

Richard  Gott,  Jim  Gunn  and  David  Schramm)  that  an  open  universe  became  favoured  on 
observational grounds131. It was then a consequence of the favour bestowed on inflationary models 
if the limiting case with Euclidean space sections addressed by Einstein and de Sitter assumed an 
almost paradigmatic role in recent researches. 
 

4. BUBBLES, CYCLES AND POSSIBLE UNIVERSES 

 
After 1930, with the general acceptance of relativistic expanding models, following Eddington’s re-
discovery  of  Lemaitre’s  work,  scholars  became  acquainted  with  the  many  possible  homogeneous 
and isotropic expanding models. From 1932/1933 many reviews132 were dedicated to the different 
possible dynamical behaviour associated with the line element of non static space/times of constant 
curvature which satisfy those assumptions which will soon be called “the cosmological principle”133 
(or, preferably, those universes which obey the simplified version of Einstein’s equations known as 
Friedmann’s equations). The best known review was that of Howard Percy Robertson dedicated in 
1933  to  what  he  called  the  “Friedmann  universes”134  and  what  we  here,  in  homage  to  the  main 
contributors  of  an  intricate  history,  prefer  to  call  the  Friedmann/Lemaitre/Robertson/Walker  (in 
short: FLRW) universes. 
As Jacques Merleau-Ponty once brilliantly wrote, all this (a path that culminated in the fundamental 
contributions  of  Robertson  and  Arthur  Walker  of  the  mid  1930’s135)  constituted  a  step  from 
“uncertain intuitions” to a “well defined axiomatic”136.

133 The first to mention a “cosmological principle of relativity” was Erwin Finlay Freundlich in discussing a postulate 
introduced  by  Edward  Milne  (see:  Freundlich,  E.F.:  Ein  neuartiger  Versuch  von  E.  A.  Milne,  das  kosmologische 
Problem zu lösen und die Expansion der Spiralnebel zu deuten, Naturwissenschaften 21, 1933, p. 54/59; Milne adopted 
then  such  a  terminology  in  his  Aberystwyth  Lectures  of  1933  (see:  Milne,  E.A.:  Relativity,  Gravitation  and  World 
Structure,  Clarendon  Press,  Oxford  1935).  In  that  same  year  Milne  stated  the  cosmological  principle  as  a  general 
precept according to which: “we refuse to consider our own viewpoint as special, and we regard any other viewpoint as 
equally good” (Milne, E.A.: Some points in the Philosophy of Physics, Philosophy 9, 1934, p. 19/38, on p. 33).

Robertson, H.P.: The Expanding Universe, Science 76, 1932, p. 221/226, on p. 225. In the early 1930’s this expression 
was often reserved for homogeneous and isotropic expanding universes which satisfy the assumption of zero pressure 
(as in  Friedmann’s  original  papers).  More  often,  it was  used to  define the whole class  of  homogeneous and isotropic 
models (with no limitation on the assumptions concerning the matter/energy content or the cosmological constant).

or  null  curvature)  soon became  very  general,  not  all  the researchers  accepted  to  assign  a  physical 
significance to the whole collection of possible FLRW universes. 
Some  of  them  believed  it  was  the  task  of  Mount  Wilson’s  observers137  to  establish  which  of  the 
ideal  universes  best  fitted  the  actual  one,  but  others  were  driven  by  philosophical  and  personal 
beliefs (or prejudices) in limiting the field of possibilities through a priori criteria of different kinds. 
The most clamorous case was probably that of Sir Arthur Eddington who, faithful to the theoretical 
ideas  which  spurred  him  towards  a  sui  generis  unitary  theory  of  general  relativity  and  quantum 
mechanics138,  never  abandoned  the  conviction  that  only  Lemaitre’s  solution  of  1927  was  indeed 
appropriate. 
The  so  called  Eddington/Lemaitre  model  describes  a  closed  but  ever  expanding  universe  which 
starts  as  an  Einstein  static  universe  and  then  expands  at  an  increasing  rate  as  a  result  of  the 
“cosmical  repulsion”  due  to  the  presence  of  a  positive  cosmological  constant.  Eddington  was  an 
extraordinary popularizer both with his colleagues as well as the general public. 
In one of his expositions he vividly pointed out how in the Eddington/Lemaitre universe: 
 
“the  radius  increases  with  time  in  geometrical  progression,  and  ultimately  objects  must  separate  at  a  rate 
greater  than  the  velocity  of  light;  there  is  no  contradiction  in  this,  for  the  separation  corresponds  not  to 
dynamical  motion  but  to  inflation  of  space.  Objects  separating  faster  than  the  velocity  of  light  are  cut  off 
from  any  causal  inference  on  one  another,  so  that  in  time  the  universe  will  become  virtually  a  number  of 
disconnected universes no longer bearing any physical relation to one another”139. 
 
Similar considerations were then re-presented in the classic “popular” essay entitled The Expanding 
Universe. Here Eddington affirmed: 
 
“I  suppose  that  the  distance  of  one  galaxy  from  the  next  will  ultimately  become  so  great,  and  the  mutual 
recession  so  rapid,  that  neither  light  nor  any  other  causal  influence  can  pass  from  one  to  another.  All 
connection  between  the  galaxies  will  be  broken;  each  will  be  a  self-contained  universe  uninfluenced  by 
anything outside it. Such a disintegration is rather a nightmare to conceive; though it does not threaten any 
particular disaster to human destiny”140. 
 
In  other  words:  galaxies  were  destined  to  become  “self  contained  universes”  in  an  accelerating 
universe, while today’s astronomers had to consider themselves “extraordinarily fortunate” to have 
arrived “just in time to observe this interesting but evanescent feature of the sky”141. 

                                                 
137  Hubble  will  write:  ”Mathematicians  deal  with  possible  worlds,  with  an  infinite  number  of  logically  consistent 
systems. Observers explore the one particular world we inhabit. Between the two stands the theorist. He studies possible 
worlds but only those which are compatible with information furnished by observers. In other words, theory attempts to 
segregate the minimum number of possible worlds which must include the actual world we inhabit. Then the observer, 
with  new  factual  information,  attempts  to  reduce  the  list  further.  And  so  it  goes,  observation  and  theory  advancing 
together toward the common goal of science, knowledge of the structure and observation of the universe” (Hubble, E.: 
The Problem of the Expanding Universe, American Scientist 30, p. 99/115, 1942, on p. 105/106).

of red shifts and the idea itself of an expanding universe (Barnes, E.W. in: Contributions to a British Discussion...1931, 
p. 721). It was then  discussed  in:  Robertson, H.P.: Relativistic  cosmology...  1933, p.  72, North, J.D.:  The Measure..., 

Similar  conclusions  are  again  fashionable  after  recent  observations  of  Type  Ia  supernovae 
suggesting that the acceleration of the universe is due to a repulsive force analogous to a positive 
cosmological  constant142.  Ideas  connected  with  these  observational  data  were  indeed  considered 
“the hottest topics of discussion among cosmologists during 1998”143. 
Of course this current debate with all its implications stems from a very different source to that of 
Eddington144.  Nevertheless  many  authors  continue  to  use  a  terminology  which  resembles  that 
adopted by the Cambridge astronomer in the early 1930’s and still talk of how a “universe doomed 
to accelerate forever will produce a state of growing uniformity and cosmic loneliness”145. 
As  we  have  seen,  Eddington  used  the  term  inflation  to  describe  the  accelerated  expansion  and 
referred  openly  to  self-contained  universes  (moreover,  he  introduced  also  the  term  “bubble”  to 
describe  “regions  between  which  no  causal  influence  can  ever  pass”146).  In  any  case,  the  main 
motive for his sustaining the Eddington/Lemaitre model lay in theoretical reasons or, better still, in 
his obstinate belief that the cosmological constant represented a fundamental standard of constancy, 
indispensable in dealing with lengths in physics.

It  was  fundamentally  for  his  singular  ideas  that  Eddington  became  one  of  Henry  Dingle’s  main 
target when, in a provocative paper appearing in the May 8th 1937 issue of Nature, he accused the 
advocates  of  a  rationalistic  approach  to  cosmology  of  being  “modern  Aristotelians”  guilty  of 
producing “metaphysics out of mathematics”147. 
Dingle surely embodied a very different tradition in his approach to the science of the universe; a 
tradition  which  can  include  de  Sitter  amongst  his  ranks  (the  Dutch  astronomer,  in  fact,  often 
remarked that the assumptions  of homogeneity  and  isotropy  were  not  “empirical  facts” but  rather 
metaphysical  hypothesis148)  and  which  presumably  found  its  main  spokesman  in  Richard  Chase 
Tolman149. 
Both  Tolman  and  Dingle150,  stated  frequently  not  to  be  overconfident  with  the  cosmological 
principle  and  suggested  extreme  caution  when  extrapolating  results  obtained  within  the  “highly 
abstract, simplified and idealized” FLRW model151. 
This  methodological  approach  is  expressed  clearly  in  Tolman’s  Relativity  Thermodynamics  and 
Cosmology, an essay published in 1934 which became an essential textbook for various generations 
of physicists. He stated that: 
 
“In the first place, we have a natural interest and intellectual pleasure in trying to develop the consequences 
of any set of mathematical assumptions without reference to possible physical applications. Secondly, since 
we have based our treatment on acceptable physical theory, we have the right to expect that the theoretical 
behaviour of our models will at least inform and liberalize our thinking as to conceptual possibilities for the 
behaviour of the actual universe. In the third place, however, and this is perhaps most important of all, we 
have the right to hope that the models can be so constructed as to assist in the correlation and explanation of 
the  observed  phenomena  of  the  actual  universe,  and  indeed  may  even  be  sufficiently  representative  as  to 
permit some cautious extrapolation forward and backward in time, which will give us not too fallacious ideas 
as to the past and future history of our surroundings”152. 
 
During the 1920’s and the early 1930’s Tolman’s main aim consisted in “attacking thermodynamic 
problems in curved space/time”153, finally achieving a coherent general relativistic thermodynamics. 
His investigations reserved important applications to cosmology (for instance, the Caltech physicist 
explored different kinds of cosmic fluid, revealing the distinctions between a universe dominated by 
matter and one dominated by radiation154). 
Tolman’s  analysis  of  the  problem  of  the  entropy  of  the  universe  came  then  into  conflict  with 
classical thermodynamics. He showed that in general relativistic thermodynamics it was possible to 
avoid  the  “dreadful  final  state  of  quiescence“155  considering  that  the  increase  of  entropy  is

requirements for a periodic behaviour of the universe, Physical Review 38, 1931, p. 1758/1771, on p. 1767). He never 
imagined anything like decoupling or any other typical conceptions of the HBB model. In any case, he understood the 
need to state not only an equation of continuity which describes the relation between pressure and density in a non static 
universe,  but  also an equation  of  state  for the fluid.  The idea  of a universe  filled with  radiation (in the context  of  de 
Sitter’s  static  model)  was  remarked  also  in:  Silberstein,  L.:  Illuminated  Spacetime:  Optical  Effects  of  Isotropic

necessarily accompanied by an increase of the proper energy and temperature of each element of a 
cosmological fluid. 
The  ideal  tool  of  Tolman’s  researches  consisted  in  a  model,  firstly  discussed  by  Friedmann  in 
1922156,  “in  which  the  proper  volume  of  the  universe  increases  from  zero  to  an  upper  limit  and 
returns”157. 
The Russian metereologist adopted a perfect fluid with zero pressure (the so called dust) and treated 
the cosmological constant (cid:21) as a parameter capable of taking any value between -(cid:22) and the positive 
value  (cid:21)E  characteristic  of  Einstein’s  static  universe  (so  that  the  larger  the  value  of  (cid:21),  the  longer 
what he called the Welt Periode became, tending to infinity for (cid:21) ﬁ (cid:21)E). For the cases of physical 
significance  Friedmann  imagined  a  cyclical  repetition  (presupposing  then  the  beginning  of  a  new 
cycle after zero radius and volume had been reached) which, in an essay of 1923, was compared to 
the “mythological conceptions of the Hindu”158. 
A  proper  cyclical  model  was  then  presented  by  the  Japanese  physicist  Tokyo  Takeuchi  in  1930, 
who  attempted  in  this  way  to  construct  an  eternal  universe  “in  agreement  with  the  view  of 
Boltzmann” 159, conjecturing at the same time a minimum radius of finite value rather than zero160. 
But a universe presenting a contracting phase after having reached a maximum expansion gained a 
certain  popularity  when  Einstein  took  up  cosmology  again161  in  May  1931  after  years  of  silence. 
Although he followed Friedmann’s original treatment, filling his model with dust, he nevertheless 
limited his analysis to the case (cid:21) = 0. 
Contrary to Friedmann, Einstein was extremely worried by the presence of a singularity and hoped 
that the dismissal of the assumption of homogeneity would have showed a realistic way out of this 
problem.  
The  “cycloidal  Friedmann/Einstein”162  universe  and  some  of  its  variants  were  then  considered  by 
other experts such as Heckmann163, Lemaitre164 and de Sitter, with the latter denouncing a “personal 
the  model165. 
idiosyncrasy” 
Nevertheless, it was substantially thanks to Tolman if many obscurities about the thermodynamical 
behaviour of the oscillating model were clarified.  
In  November  1931Tolman  considered  homogeneous  universes  which  expand  and  contract 
reversibly  at  a  finite  rate  without  any  increase  in  entropy.  He  then  discarded  the  Takeuchi  model 
(which  involves  a  negative  pressure)  as  unphysical  and  proved  that  contraction  to  zero  proper 
volume  could  only  be followed  by  renewed expansion.  He,  furthermore,  showed  that  a  “series  of 
successive  expansions  and  contractions”  were  inevitable  in  the  Friedmann/Einstein  model166,  a 
conclusion which remained valid even if the universe was filled with radiation (or with any other

fluid  which  does  not  imply  negative  pressures).  Two  months  later  Tolman  concluded  that  no 
thermodynamic  hindrance  due  to  irreversible  processes  could  prevent  the  succession  of  cycles  of 
the oscillating model with a null or negative cosmological constant167. He showed, moreover, that 
as a consequence of an increase of entropy, the scale factor must assume a greater maximum value 
(once maximum expansion has been reached) at any new cycle168. 
As an appendix of this last paper the American physicist presented, jointly with his student Morgan 
Ward,  a  new  article169  to  discuss  in  depth  the  nature  of  singularities  in  the  case  (cid:21)  =  0.  This  new 
contribution appears in retrospect less redundant than his preceding papers, and it is for this reason 
often considered Tolman’s main result170. 
In  effect,  this  paper  stated  clearly  that  an  exceptional  point  of  null  volume  was  inevitable  in  the 
ideal closed universe with no cosmological constant and a physically meaningful fluid (i.e.: stating 
realistic  assumptions  on  the  matter/energy  tensor)  and  that  a  continued  succession  of  expansions 
and  contractions  was  then  to  be  expected  on  physical  grounds171  despite  the  reversible  or 
irreversible nature of the processes taking place in the cosmic fluid. 
The  unavoidability  of  singularities  was  particularly  intriguing  for  Lemaitre,  who  invoked  the 
legendary phoenix to describe the behaviour of the oscillating model172 and, some years later, talked 
explicitly of a succession of “completely new universes”173. 
Such an image was substantiated in the early 1970’s by John Archibald Wheeler who imagined that 
the  beginning  of  any  new  cycle  of  an  oscillating  universe  implied  a  re-generation  of  the 
fundamental constants and of the form of the expansion dynamics, thus depicting the scenario of a 
temporal sequence of disjointed universes174. 
In any case, until the 1970’s, the oscillating closed model with (cid:21) = 0 was generally considered as 
the best FLRW universe available both on observational175 and theoretical grounds. Popular essays 
were dedicated to it by authors such as Gamow and Öpik176 and the model was indeed favoured (at 
least as a “working hypothesis”) by Dicke and Peebles in the papers which followed the discovery 
of  cosmic  black  body  radiation177.  Dicke,  as  many  others  before  him,  was  attracted  by  the 
oscillating  model  because  of  the  possibility  of  avoiding  an  original  creation  of  matter  (or  at  least 
relegating it to the infinite past)178.

Such  a  hope  was  indeed  frustrated  by  the  singularity  theorems  of  Hawking  and  Penrose  (which 
demonstrated that singularities were inevitable even if the assumptions of homogeneity and isotropy 
were discarded, consequently raising doubts as to the physical reality itself of more than one cycle) 
and  later  by  a  series  of  thermodynamical  arguments  that  seem  to  forbid  the  possibility  itself  of  a 
bounce at the end of the phase of contraction179. 
Finally,  both  Zeldovich  and  Novikov  and  Joseph  Silk  showed  that  an  infinity  of  past  oscillations 
was  impossible180  (and  that  a  beginning  of  time  was  consequently  “unavoidable”)  on  the  basis of 
the finite value of the entropy per baryon number (or specific entropy) in the actual universe181. 
Let us further add that Wheeler was forced to abandon his infinitely cyclical universe (concluding at 
last  that  only  one  cycle  was  admissible)  and  that  other  proposals  of  a  multiverse  founded  on  the 
basic concept of bouncing closed universes were then advanced by M. A. Markov in the 1980’s182 
and, more recently, within studies involving the temporal variation of fundamental183 constants or 
within  the  ambit  of  cosmological  applications  of  string  theory  (where  Steinhardt  and  Turok,  with 
their ekpyrotic/cyclic scenarios, claimed to have showed that the universe does not pass through a 
singularity  if  we  interpret  the  big  crunch/big  bang  as  collisions  of  branes  in  the  context  of  M-
theory184). 
Returning to Tolman, he remained, indeed, uncertain about the meaning of the results obtained from 
the idealized homogeneous model and did not renounce his belief that Einstein’s suggestion could 
in  fact  be  realized185. In  the  paper together  with  Ward  he  noted that “the  idealization  upon  which 
our  considerations  have  been  based  should  be  regarded  as  failing  in  the  neighbourhood  of  zero 
volume”186, while in Relativity Thermodynamics and Cosmology he stated explicitly that: 
 
“… the finer details of cosmic behaviour could not in any case be represented by a perfectly homogeneous 
model. Thus, for example, it should be clearly appreciated that the lower singular state of exactly zero radius, 
which might be thought of as occurring in the case of an oscillatory time behaviour, must be regarded as the 
attribute of a certain class of homogeneous models, and not as a state that would necessarily accompany an 
oscillating expansion and contraction of the whole or parts of the real universe”187.

On  this  basis  and  convinced  of  the  dangers  of  “applying  to  the  actual  universe  any  wide 
extrapolations - either spatial or temporal - of results deduced from strictly homogeneous models” 
Tolman  proposed  in  1934  a  model  universe  with  variable  curvature  and  filled  with  dust,  where 
“non-interacting zones” with an open geometry and zones with a closed one (as well as expanding 
and contracting regions) co-existed188. 
Approximately  in  the  same  period  Dingle  stated  that “we  have  no  grounds  for  supposing  that  the 
part  of  the  universe  which  is  observed  is  typical  of  the  whole”189  and  pointed  towards  the  line 
element  of  a  “not  very  inhomogeneous”  or  “nearly  homogeneous”  universe  of  which  the  FLRW 
was a special case190. 
In 1936 Dingle adopted the “idea that our expanding system of nebulae is merely a local unit in a 
larger universe” within the proposal of a universe “majestically quiescent on the grand scale” (i.e. a 
globally stationary universe where expansion concerns only local regions or particular epochs)191. 
Conceptions  of  a  universe  which  is  inhomogeneous  on  a  large  scale,  apart  from  the  fundamental 
contributions  of  Lemaitre192,  were  typical  of  Soviet  authors  (from  Moris  Semenovich  Eigenson, 
who  described  in  the  1930’s  an  infinite  universe  where  the  expansion  was  a  local  occurrence,  to 
Shirokov  and  Fisher193)  who  shared  with  Tolman194  the  need  of  avoiding  a  special  beginning  (or 
simply an origin) of the whole world. 
With  regard  to  this  last  subject,  an  interesting  proposal  of  a  “self-perpetuating”  inhomogeneous 
universe  with  density  fluctuations  on  all  the  observable  scales  was  presented  by  Ronald  Gordon 
Giovanelli in 1963195. 
The  Australian  physicist  imagined  that  the  average  density  and  expansion  rate  of  the  observed 
universe  “need  not  be  representative  of  the  universe  as  a  whole”  and  aimed  then  to  find 
compatibility,  on  a  statistical  basis,  between  inhomogeneity  and  the  “aesthetic  attractiveness”  of 
steady-state  cosmology.  He  pictured  an  eternal,  infinite  universe  where  “the  time-averaged 
properties of any one region may be the same for all parts of the universe, though at any one time 
the properties of individual regions might differ greatly”. 
Without quoting Tolman and Dingle, Giovanelli similarly presented a picture where “some regions 
may  be expanding,  others  contracting” and  where  “ this  state  of affairs may reverse  from  time  to 
time”.  He  asked,  moreover,  in  what  way  our  observable  region  of  the  universe  could  be  defined 
“atypical” suggesting that 
 
“a description of the universe beyond our “observable” region is not merely of philosophical interest but is of 
direct  importance  for  understanding  the  dynamics  of,  and  the  density  distribution  within,  our  observable 
region”196.

n and the Christoffel Symbols for a Line-

 
In  recent  times  such  a  question  has  assumed  considerable  relevance  after  the  affirmation  that  the 
large  structure  of  the  universe  could  derive  from  quantum  fluctuations  occurring  during  the 
inflationary phase and, since then, redshifted well beyond the particle horizon. 
Such  an  idea  has  also  been  exploited  to  point  towards  a  mechanism  (i.e.:  a  backreaction  effect  of 
super-horizon perturbations) capable of explaining the presumed acceleration of the universe as an 
alternative to dark energy197. 

 
5.JUST A BRIEF CONCLUSION 

 
Andrei Linde has recently confessed his belief in inflationary theory since it is “by now … 20 years 
old” while the “typical lifetime of a new trend in high energy physics and cosmology nowadays [is] 
5  to  10  years”198.  His  optimism  is,  in  my  mind,  hard  to  share,  although  legitimised  all  the  same 
since mathematically founded speculations must be considered essential to physical progress.  
In  any  case,  what  I  find  remarkable  in  current  debates  on  the  multiverse  is  the  persistence of  old 
issues such as those concerning the relation between laws and initial conditions (or those related to 
what  is  necessary  and  what  is  accidental,  which  is  by  and  large  the  same)  or  the  controversies 
concerning antinomies such as finite/infinite, originated in time/eternal, globally evolving/globally 
stationary. 
These topics seem to recur again and again and each time they present themselves on increasingly 
deeper  levels  of  physical  knowledge.  They  were  of  principal  relevance  to  the  HBB/steady-state 
controversy and were then shifted to the very outset of the evolutionary history of the universe, to 
then pass finally onto the multiverse scenarios. 
One  could  simply  conclude  that  since  the  “Universe”  is  a  name  given  to  the  most  inclusive  and 
comprehensive physical system, talk of many universes is surely purely non-sense199. However, as 
Lewis  Feuer  noted  in  1933,  if  one  assumes  that  “there  is  nothing  necessary  about  a  physical 
universe”,  it  follows  that  “speculations  about  the  existence  of  universes  with  different  laws  of 
physics are legitimate”200.

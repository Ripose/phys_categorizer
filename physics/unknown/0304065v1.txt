Abstract 

        Time-dependent  wave  packet  calculations  for  the  reaction  H+HCl  and  its 

isotopic  reactions  are  carried  out  on  the  potential  energy  surface  (PES)  of  Bian  and 

Werner (BW2) [Bian, W.; Werner, H. –J., J. Chem. Phys. 2000, 112, 220]. Reaction 

probabilities for the exchanged and abstraction channels are calculated from various 

initial rotational states of the reagent. Those have then been used to estimate reaction 

cross  sections  and  rate  constants  which  also  calculated  and  explained  by  the 

zero-point  energy  and  the  tunneling  effect.  The  results  of  this  work  were  compared 

with  that  of  previous  quasiclassical  trajectory  calculations  and  reaction  dynamics 

experimental on the abstraction channel. In addition, the calculated rate constants are 

in the reasonably good agreement with experimental measurement for both channels. 

Key  word:  ab  initio,  H/D+  DCl/HCl,  collision  energy,  integral  cross  section,  rate 

constant.

1. Introduction 

The time-dependent quantum wave packet (TDWP) approach1,2 has emerged as a 

powerful  computational 

tool 

for  studying  quantum 

reaction  dynamics  of 

A+BC(cid:198)AB+C systems2-17. Furthermore, the TDWP approach is conceptually simple. 

It provides an interpretation of the numerical results through time propagation of the 

wave packet. 7-9   

The  gas-phase  reaction  of  H+HCl  and  the  corresponding  isotopic  reaction  of 

H+DCl  represent  important  elementary  steps  in  the  H2/D2+Cl2(cid:198)2H/DCl  reaction 

system, which has played a major role in the development of chemical kinetics and to 

the  environment  in  atmospheric  chemistry.  21-25  Whereas  the  measured  relative 

excitations 

functions 

(ERσ

col),  obtained 

in 

the  collision  energy 

range 

Ecol=0.17-0.35eV,  revealed  a  marked  preference  for  H+DCl  product  channel.  The 

further QCT calculations have been carried out for the H+DCl isotope reaction which 

can  be  compared  with  the  results  of  previous  reaction  dynamics  experiments  of 

Barclay et al.26 Polanyi and co-workers who observed that for the H+DCl reaction the 

abstraction  cross  section  decreases  with  increasing  collision  energy  from  a  value  of 

0.2Å2 at Ecol=1.2eV to a valueof 0.1Å2 at Ecol=1.8eV.26 

The first globally realistic Cl-H-H potential energy surface (PES) was calculated 

by Baer and Last27 and more recent PES was published by Truhlar et. al.28 The latter 

one was used by Polanyi et. al. in quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) calculations to study 

the  branching  between  D  atom  abstraction  and  hydrogen  atom  exchanged  in  the 

reaction of translationally energetic H atoms with DCl.26 The D atom abstraction and 

hydrogen atom exchange reaction cross section measurements are carried out for the 

 

2 

H+DCl  reaction  in  the  energy  range  of  1.0~2.4eV.26  In  1999  a  new,  completely  ab 

initio, PES of Bian and Werner29 (BW2) has become available. The PES of Bian and 

Werner  was  developed  based  on  extensive  ab  initio  calculations  using  the  highly 

accurate  electronic  structure  methods  and  very  large  basis  sets  presently  available. 

The ab  initio  calculations were  carried out at more than 1200 nuclear geometries. It 

was  further  improved  by  scaling  the  correlation  energies  at  all  geometries  with  a 

constant factor.29

In  this  paper,  we  have  carried  out  TDWP  calculations  for  the  following  four

Isotopic  effect  in  chemical  reaction  attracts  many  interests  for  a  long  time. 

Quantum tunneling and zero-point energy shift are the most common isotopic effects 

that are usually investigated. First, when chemical reaction occurs at low temperature 

 

3 

and translational energy, the isotopic tunneling effect can often make reaction happen 

below  the  classical  barrier  height.  And  this  effect  often  appears  when  the  effective 

mass  of  the  coordinate  is  strongly  coupled  with  the  reaction  pathway  changes,  e.g., 

generally the proton abstraction exhibits larger tunneling effect than that of the proton 

replaced by deuterium. Second, for a chemical reaction process, the isotopic effect on 

the  potential  energy  surface  reflects  mainly  on  the  zero-point  energy  revision  to  the 

reaction  path  and  this  revision  is  caused  by  the  change  of  the  normal-vibration 

frequencies.  This  kind  of  shift  sometimes  can  give  remarkable  influence  to  the 

micro-dynamics.   

In addition, the H+HCl and its isotopic variants have played an important role in 

chemical  kinetics  due  to  its  importance  to  the  environment  in  atmospheric 

chemistry.25  The  dynamics  of  the  four  reactions  have  been  the  subject  of  many 

theoretical and experimental studies. To the best of our knowledge, no TDWP for the 

H+HCl and its isotopic reactions system was reported so far on the BW2 PES. 

The aim of the present study was to investigate the collision energy dependence 

of the probabilities (for total angular momentum quantum number 

J

), reaction cross 

sections  and  thermal  rate  constants  of  the  four  reactions  is  in  the  range  of 

temperatures  between  200K  and  1000K  by  means  of  a  close  coupling  (CC) 

time-dependent (TDWP) approach on the new BW2 PES.

This  article  is  organized  as  follows:  Section  2  gives  a  brief  review  of  the 

theoretical  methodologies  to  atom-diatom  reactions  used  in  the  current  study.  The 

results of calculation and discussion of the result are given in Sec. 3. We conclude in

In  this  section  we  briefly  describe  the  time-dependent  wave  packet  (TDWP) 

method employed to calculate the initial state-selected total reaction probability with 

the  final  resolved  products.  The  reader  is  referred  to  ref.  33  for  more  detailed 

discussions  of  the  methodology.  In  the  present  study  we  solve  the  time-dependent

We  employed  the  split-operator  method34  to  carry  out  the  wave  packet 

propagation.  The  time-dependent  wavefunction  is  absorbed  at  the  edges  of  the  grid 

area  to  avoid  artificial  reflections.35  Finally  the  initial  state-selected  total  (final 

state-summed) reaction probabilities are obtained through the flux calculation34 at the 

end of the propagation. 

We  construct  wave  packets  and  propagate  them  to  calculate  the  reaction 

probabilities for each product. Using the following formula34

are as follows: A total of 100 vibrational functions are employed for 

r

  in the range

  for the reagents HCl/DCl in the interaction region. A total number of 

200  sine  functions  (among  them  80  for  the  interaction  region)  are  employed  for  the 

translational  coordinate

39 It was found that convergence of total cross sections, 

for all the reported initial (rotational) states in the entire energy region, was achieved 

up  to  a  few  percent.  For  lower 

J

,  we  propagate  the  wave  packets  for  15000a.u.  of 

time  to  converge  the  low  energy  reaction  probability  (in  all  calculations  a  time

step-size of 10a.u. was used). In this calculation, we used 

J

  from 0 to 80 to calculate 

the  cross  section.  For 

J

>20,  we  propagate  the  wave  packets  for  a  shorter  time 

because the reaction probability in the low energy region is negligible.

34   

 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
A.  Reaction probabilities   

First of all, we computed the energy resolved reaction probability for the Eq. X 

reactions  for  collision  energies  at  the  range  of  [0.1,1.4]eV  with  HCl/DCl  initially  in 

their ground states. We plotted the results of probabilities of 

J

=0 as a function of the 

collision  energy  on  BW2  potential  for  all  possible  reactions  in  Fig.1.  As  shown  in 

Fig.1, the behavior of the reaction probabilities corresponding to Eq. X reactions are 

quite  different.  For  the  exchanged  channel  in  Fig.1(a),  the  difference  seems  to 

increase with the increasing of the collision energy. The reaction probabilities for the 

H+HCl reaction are systematically lower than those of H+DCl reaction. Moreover, for 

the abstraction channel one can find from Fig.1(b) that the reaction probabilities for 

the  D+DCl  reaction  are  very  close  to  those  of  H+HCl  reaction.  The  reaction 

probabilities  of  the  H+DCl  are  systematically  lower  than  those  of  the  other  three 

reactions.  The  reaction  probability  of  the  D+HCl  reaction  is  much  higher  than  the 

other  three  reactions  in  both  channels.  Perhaps  the  high  zero-point  energy  made  the 

D+HCl reaction probabilities higher than the others.   

The  H/D+HCl  reaction  exhibits  strong  oscillating  effect,  but  it  is  smooth  for 

H/D+DCl. It is due to that the tunneling effect affects the H atom stronger than the D 

atom.  As  a  result,  the  oscillating  behavior  displayed  in  the  four  reactions  nearly 

 

9 

disappears for the abstraction channel. 

The  reaction  probabilities  as  a  function  of  collision  energy  for  total  angular 

momentum of 

J

=0,8,18 and 28, are presented graphically in Fig.2 and 3 of the four 

reactions for both channels. It can be seen that in the Fig. 2 the curve of the reaction 

probabilities  of  D+DCl  are  very  similar  to  the  D+HCl  reaction.  The  probabilities  of 

J

=18,28 are higher than the =0,8 in the high energy. And the H+DCl and H+HCl 

J

are  very  similar.  The  probabilities  of 

J

=28  are  almost  equal  to  zero  in  the  bottom 

two  figures  of  fig.  2.  It  can  be  seen  from  the  fig.  3  the  abstraction  channel  that  no 

significant oscillating behavior is found. The values of reaction probabilities decrease 

with  an  increase  of 

J

  in  the  abstraction  channel.  The  threshold  of  probabilities  is 

increased with the increasing of 

J

  in both channels. 

The effect of the initial reagent rotation excitation on the reaction probability for 

the  four  reactions    ( =0, =0, =1,3,5,7,9)  is  shown  in  Fig.  4,5,6,7.  As  seen  from 

v

J

j

the figures, the reaction probabilities of the four reactions increased obviously and the 

oscillating  of  them  turns  stronger  as  the  rotational  quantum  number 

j

  increases  in 

the exchanged channels.

37 The increase and the oscillating perhaps can be explained 

by a long-range van der Waals well in both the entrance and exit channel that is the 

same as the explanation in ref. 18. The negative values of the reaction probabilities in 

the low energy region are negligible with the approximate of the theory. 

B.  Integral Cross Sections 
 

 

 

10 

Next  we  calculate  the  integral  cross  section  for  the  initial  ground  state  of 

HCl/DCl on BW2 surface. The calculated integral cross sections for the four reactions 

are depicted in Fig.8 for the both channels. Fig. 8(a) is for exchanged channel and the 

Fig. 8(b) is for the abstraction channel. As one can be seen, from the Fig. 8(a), that the 

cross  sections  of  the  four  reactions  increase  with  further  increase  of  the  collision 

energy.  It  can  be  seen  that  the  four  reactions  curves  are  very  similar,  but  the  cross 

section of H+HCl reaction is the highest one of the four reactions for the exchanged 

channel, while those of D+HCl reaction is the highest one for the abstraction channel. 

The calculated cross sections for H+DCl are depicted in Fig. 9. As can be seen, 

the present cross sections for the abstraction channel are systematically larger than the 

corresponding  experimental  values  (triangle),  of  Polanyi  and  co-workers26  and  the 

results  of  QCT  are  bigger  than  the  result  of  TDWP  except  the  range  of  collision 

energy [0.8,1.2]eV, and they  have  the same threshold energy. But for the exchanged 

channel the cross sections are almost equal to the corresponding experimental value 

(squares) lying between 0.25Å2 and 0.75 Å2 for the collision energy range considered 

in  the  previous  work  calculations.26  The  result  of  QCT  is  much  lower  than  that  of 

TDWP  in  the  lower  energy  but  after  1.35eV  it  is  changed.  The  threshold  energy  of 

QCT is much higher than that of TDWP, due to that the TDWP method has included 

the zero-point energy and the tunneling effect.   

The four reactions have slightly different threshold energy for the same channels. 

The difference can be interpreted by the different zero-point energy and the different 

tunneling effect. In the collinear transition state for the abstraction reaction, the height 

of the classical barriers is 0.184eV for BW2 PES.29 For the H+ClH exchange reaction, 

 

11 

which  also  has  a  collinear  transition  state,  the  barrier  height  is  computed  to  be 

0.776eV  for  BW2  PES.29  The  barrier  heights  of  the  exchanged  channel  of  the  BW2 

surface also exhibits small vdw wells the abstraction channel are much lower than the 

exchanged  channel  of  the  four  reactions.  So  the  thresholds  of  the  four  reactions  for 

exchanged channel are a little bit higher than those of the abstraction channel. Overall 

the results calculated for the abstraction channel are much higher than those given for 

the exchange channel on BW2 surface. 

 

C.  Rate constant 
 

To calculate the total reaction probability for more than two values of 

J

  in order 

to obtain more accurate rate constant,

32 a very accurate rate constant can be obtained 

by using reaction probabilities evaluated at more than 6 values of 

. J

We calculate the reaction rate constants 

  that are given for the initial states 

(
'r T

)

by using the uniform version of the 

J

-shift approach. The calculation of the thermal 

rate  constants  is  in  the  range  of  temperatures  between  200K  and  1000K.  The 

calculated  rate  constants  for  the  four  reactions  are  depicted  in  Fig.  10  for  the  both 

channels.  Fig.  10(a)  is  for  the  exchanged  channel  and  the  Fig.  10(b)  is  for  the 

abstraction  channel.  As  can  be  seen,  from  the  Fig.  10(a)  at  lower  temperature  the 

present  rate  constants  of  D+DCl  is  the  highest  one,  and  those  of  the  H+HCl  is  the 

smallest  one.  While at the  higher temperature the present rate constant of H+DCl  is 

the highest one, and that of the D+HCl is the smallest one. From the Fig. 10(b) one 

can  see  that  the  rate  constant  curves  of  H+HCl  reaction  are  almost  equal  to  that  of 

 

12 

D+HCl reaction. And the rate constants of H+DCl and D+DCl almost equate. The rate 

constants of the H/D+DCl reactions are smaller than those of H/D+HCl reactions. As 

can be seen, the present rate constants roughly follow the same as the corresponding 

experimental values which at the range of [10-17,10-12] cm3s-1. 30-37 

This can also be taken as an indication that the existence of quantum effects such 

as tunneling may play an important role. So, according to our calculation results here, 

the possible reasons for the nonlinear behavior of the Arrhenius plots of the reactions 

should be the combination influence of tunneling effect. 

 

4. CONCLUSIONS 

In this work we have investigated the reaction probabilities as a function of the 

collision  energy  for  the  four  H+HCl,  H+DCl,  D+HCl  and  D+DCl  reactions  and 

studied the influence of the initial state excitation of the reagents applying the TDWP 

method to study the H+HCl reaction on the BW2 PES. First, the quantum tunneling 

can strengthen reactive ability of H abstraction in low temperatures and translational 

energy, and the deuterium replacement of hydrogen will weaken the tunneling effect. 

In the high temperature and collision energy condition, the H atom has more chances 

to  collide  with  Cl  atom  and  thus  the  reaction  will  produce  more  HCl,  so  the 

exchanged channel increase faster than abstraction channel. The second, the van der 

Waals  interactions  and  the  centrifugal  barrier,  which  traps  the  hydrogen  for  a  finite 

time,  are  included  for  depicting  the  effect  of  the  rotational  quantum  number 

j

  for 

the four reactions. The third, the cross sections and rate constants are calculated and 

explained  by  the  zero-point  energy  and  the  tunneling  effect  for  the  four  reactions, 

 

13 

which are higher than the previous results. The agreement of the presented results is 

good enough comparing with the experimental results, but the BW2 PES need to be 

improved.

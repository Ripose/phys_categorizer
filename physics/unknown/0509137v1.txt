Abstract

The  excess  electron  in  liquid  ammonia  ("ammoniated  electron")  is  commonly

viewed as a cavity electron in which the s-type wave function fills the interstitial void

between 6-9 ammonia molecules. Herewith an alternative model is examined in which

the ammoniated electron is regarded as a solvent stabilized multimer radical anion, as

was originally suggested by Symons [Chem. Soc. Rev. 1976, 5, 337]. In this model, most

of the excess electron density resides in the frontier orbitals of N atoms in the ammonia

molecules forming the solvation cavity; a fraction of this spin density is transferred to the

molecules  in  the  second  solvation  shell.  The  cavity  is  formed  due  to  the  repulsion

between  negatively  charged  solvent  molecules.  Using  density  functional  theory

calculations for small ammonia cluster anions in the gas phase, it is demonstrated that

such core anions would quantitatively account for the observed pattern of Knight shifts
for 1H and 14N nuclei as observed by NMR spectroscopy and the downshifted stretching

and bending modes as observed by IR-Raman spectroscopies. It is speculated that the

excess electrons in other aprotic solvents (but not in water and alcohols) might be, in this

respect,  analogous  to  the  ammoniated  electron,  with  substantial  transfer  of  the  spin

density into the frontier N and C orbitals of methyl, amino, and amide groups forming the

solvation cavity.

1. Introduction.

While  the  solvated  electron  in  liquid  ammonia  (also  known  as  "ammoniated
− ) is the first known example 1 of a stable excess electron in any liquid, 2,3 its

electron",  eam

structure  remains  elusive.  Most  of  the  theories  of  electron  solvation  are  one-electron

models in which a single quantum mechanical particle, the excess electron, interacts with

the  solvent  molecules  (that  are  treated  classically)  by  means  of  an  effective  potential.

This idealized particle-in-a-box approach has been the standard fixture of all successful
theories  for  electron  solvation,  from  the  original  (static)  dielectric  continuum  4,5,6 and
semicontinuum  models  7-11  to  the  latest  advanced  models  12-16  in  which  the  solvent

dynamics are explicitly treated. For ammoniated electron, the one-electron models were
first suggested by Ogg, 4 and further developed by Jortner 5 and Kestner.  6 More recent

examples of this approach are Feynman's Path Integral Monte-Carlo (PIMC) calculations
of  Klein  and  co-workers  17-20  and  Rodriguez  et  al.  21  and  Quantum  Path  Integral
Molecular Dynamics (QUPID) calculations for large anion clusters by Barnett et al.  22

(the dielectric continuum models were adapted for such clusters in refs. 23).

These  theories  suggest  that  ammoniated  electron  is  localized  in  a  cavity

comprised  of  8-9  ammonia  molecules  with  the  gyration  radius  variously  estimated
between 2 and 4 Å. As suggested by PIMC calculations of Sprik, Impey and Klein, 17 the

pair correlation function for center-of-mass (c) electron-H distribution has a peak at 2.1 Å

and the c-N distribution has the peak at 2.9 Å. These estimates depend on the choice of
(unknown) pseudopotential; e.g., Marchi et al.  20 and Rodriguez et al.  21  give for these

two peaks 3.4 and 4 Å, respectively. The volume change on electron solvation at 1 atm is
ca. 100 cm3/mol which is three times the volume occupied by solvent molecules. 20 This

volume  corresponds  to  a  sphere  with  the  radius  of  3.4  Å.  Using  dielectric  continuum
models, Jortner  5  estimated  the  hard  core  radius  of  the  spherical  cavity  as  3  Å,  while
Kestner 6 obtained a lower estimate of 1.7-2.2 Å. The cavity is formed by dangling N-H

groups, and the s-like wavefunction of the ground state excess electron is fully contained

within the cavity (at 1 atm). In the one-electron models, the cavity is formed due to the

Pauli exclusion of the excess electron by the valence electrons in ammonia molecules

(which have no electron affinity in the gas phase). Some model calculations suggested

that there is a preferential orientation of one of the N-H bonds towards the center of the

cavity, whereas other calculations indicated that an orientation in which all three N-H

bonds  of  the  molecule  are  turned  towards  the  cavity  center  were  equally  likely  (see
Abramczyk  and  Kroh  8  for  more  detail).  This  uncertainty  is  traceable  to  the  relative
weakness of N..H-N hydrogen bonding in ammonia, as compared to water. 24

essential physics,  27 at least to a first approximation: the transfer of spin density to the

frontier  orbitals  of  oxygen  is  relatively  small.  For  eam

evidence points to the contrary. Below, we briefly review this evidence.

The ammoniated electrons can be prepared by dissolving alkali metal in liquid
ammonia. 2,3 When the concentration of the metal is lower than a few millimoles per dm3,

the properties of the excess electron do not depend on the type and the concentration of
the metal which suggests that alkali cations are not included in the cavity. 2,3,28 Due to the

stability of the excess electron in ammonia, there are spectroscopic data for  eam

lacking for the excess electrons in hydroxylated, liquid solvents, such as water, where the
lifetime of the electron is limited. 27 In particular, it is possible to determine the Knight
− . 28,29,30 To our knowledge,
shifts for 1H and 14N nuclei in the molecules that "solvate"  eam
such  data  exist  for  only  two  other  solvents,  methylamine  31  and  hexamethyl
phosphoramide (HMPA); 32 solutions of Na in these liquids 32-35 also yield stable solvated
electrons that absorb in the IR 33,34 and exhibit a characteristical motional narrowed line

in their Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectra. 33,35 The Knight shift of nuclear

magnetic  resonance  (NMR)  lines  is  due  to  the  contact  Fermi  (isotropic)  hyperfine
interaction of the excess electron with the magnetic nuclei in the solvent molecules; 2,3,28

it is the measure of spin density in the s-type atomic orbitals (AOs) centered on a given
nucleus. This shift can be converted into the sum  Σ

X A  of isotropic hyperfine coupling

constants  (hfcc's)  for  all  nuclei  of  type  X  that  interact  with  the  excess  electron.  In
ammonia, this calculations gives +110 G for 14N and -15.8 G for 1H (1 G = 10-4 T). 3,29,31
The negative sign of the isotropic hfcc for protons was demonstrated by Lambert 36 using

dynamic  nuclear  polarization  experiments  and  then  confirmed  by  direct  NMR
measurements. 29 Given that the atomic hfcc for the electron in the 2s orbital of  14N is
+550 G, Symons 3 estimated that ≈20% of the total spin density of the excess electron is
−  is, in fact, a solvent

transferred to these N 2s  orbitals. This immediately suggests that  eam

stabilized radical anion in which the unpaired electron is shared by ammonia molecules;

only  a  fraction  of  the  total  electron  density  resides  in  the  interstitial  cavity.  Symon's

estimate does not include the spin density transferred to N 2p orbitals, as only s-type AOs
contribute to the isotropic hfcc on 14N. However, such a transfer can be inferred from the
negative  sign  for  proton  hfcc's.  3  This  sign  presents  a  formidable  challenge  to  one-

electron models, as only positively valued hfcc's can be obtained in the absence of bond
spin  polarization.  37  Symons  3  suggested  that  the  proton  hfcc  is  negative  due  to  the

conjugation of H 1s and N 2p orbitals via spin bond polarization mechanism involving
the hybrid N sp2 orbital, similar to that occurring in p-radicals. This polarization results in

a negative contribution to the proton hfcc that cancels the positive contribution from the

interaction with the cavity-filling electron density. For this mechanism to operate at all,

there should be a substantial occupancy of the N 2p orbitals.

Additional evidence for the crucial involvement of nitrogen AOs comes from the

EPR and electron spin echo spectroscopies and NMR relaxation studies of dilute sodium
solutions reviewed in refs. 2, 3, 28, and 36. The studies of electron spin echo relaxation 38
and EPR linewidth 39 indicate that while the exchange of 1H for 2H does not decrease the
electron relaxation times, the exchange of 14N for 15N decreases the T2 time by 20-26%. 38
The relaxation times for 1H and 2H nuclei (for shifted NMR lines) are almost the same as

in the bulk liquid, whereas the relaxation time for  14N is drastically shortened. 30,40,41,42
These observations suggest that the electron spin is strongly coupled to  14N nuclei; the

contribution  from  the  protons,  even  anisotropic  one  (via  dipole  dipole  coupling),  is

minor.  Such  a  result  appears  to  be  inconsistent  with  one-electron  model,  since  the

nitrogens are located further  from  the  center  of  the  solvation  cavity  than  the  protons,
regardless which orientation (bond or dipole) is preferred. Detailed models of 1H  36,41,42
−   that  were  developed  in  the  late  1960s,  following  the
and  14N  28,30  relaxation  near  eam
original  approach  by  Kaplan  and  Kittel,  40  suggested  that  the  spin  density  is  divided

between 20-40 magnetically equivalent nitrogens (in the most advanced of these models
suggested by Catterall, 28 there are only 3-13 such nitrogens). The uncertainty in these

estimates is due to the unknown correlation time for the motion of solvent molecules near

the cavity; it is this motion that causes the electron and nuclear spin relaxation.

Following the original suggestions of O'Reilly 9,30 and Land and O'Reilly, 10 these

magnetic resonance data were initially construed to indicate that the electron in liquid

ammonia is trapped inside a large bubble (similar to the electron bubble in liquid helium);
43 the 20-40 ammonia molecules at the wall of this bubble were thought to share the spin

density equally. Such a model was completely incompatible with optical spectroscopy

and  thermodynamics  data  and  it  was  quickly  abandoned  in  favor  of  a  tight  solvation
cavity model advocated by Jortner 5 and Kestner.  6 In 1976, Symons 3 realized that the

spin density does not have to be divided equally between the nitrogens. He speculated
−   does  have  the  tight  structure  suggested  by  the  one-electron  models:  the

that  eam

molecules are clustered around a small void (of ca. 4-6 Å in diameter) that is partially

filled by the electron wavefunction. However, a fraction of the unpaired electron density

is divided between 6 ammonia molecules in the first coordination shell (with an isotropic

hfcc of ca. +12 G) and 12 molecules in the second shell (with a small hfcc of ca. +3 G).
In 1979, Smith, Symons, and Wardman 44 used EPR to determine isotropic hfcc's for 14N

nuclei in ammoniated F-center on the surface of MgO; these hfcc's (ca. 11±0.5 G) were
− . Further
close to the predicted values  3 for  14N nuclei in the first solvated shell of  eam

support of Symon's hypothesis was provided by ab initio  calculations of dimer, trimer,
and  tetramer  anion  clusters  by  Newton  45  and  Clark  and  Illing.  46  These  calculations

indicated  large  spin  densities  on  N  atoms  and  yielded  small  negative  hfcc's  for  the
protons via bond spin polarization, in a fashion predicted by Symons 6 (section 2).

In  the  early  1980s,  the  accuracy  of  Knight  shift  measurements  for  1H and  13C
nuclei was improved 29,31 and the temperature range of these measurements increased. 29

These  more  recent  measurements  only  strengthened  the  conclusions  reached  by  the
researchers in the 1960s and 1970s. Furthermore, Symons' approach  3 was successfully
used to account for the observed Knight shifts on 14N and 13C nuclei for solvated electron
in methylamine, 31 where both the amine and the methyl groups are at the cavity wall.

Apart from these magnetic resonance data, there is another structural aspect of the

problem that has not yet been addressed within the framework of one-electron models.
Raman spectra of hydrated electron, recently obtained by Mathies and Tauber  47a,b and
Tahara and co-workers, 48 indicate a large downshift in the frequency of the O-H stretch
(ca.  300  cm-1)  47,48  and  a  smaller  downshift  for  the  H-O-H  bend  (ca.  30  cm-1)  --  as
compared to water molecules in the bulk liquid. Mathies and Tauber 47b speculate that

these downshifts originate through the weakening of the H-O bonds due to the transfer of

the excess electron density into the frontier orbitals of oxygen atoms. Similar downshifts,

originating through this weakening, were observed in density functional theory and ab
initio calculations of medium size water anion clusters. 49 By analogy, one might expect a
− ,  where  the  solvation  is  by  the  N-H  groups  instead  of  the  O-H

similar  pattern  for  eam

groups.  Despite  the  extensive  search,  no  line  shifts  in  the  Raman  spectra  of  liquid
ammonia were found upon the addition of alkali metals. 50a The only change observed is

in  the  relative  intensities  of  the  combined  2 4
(symmetric stretch), and the  ν

3 mode (asymmetric stretch). In the IR spectra of dilute
potassium  solutions  (<  5x10-4  mol  dm-3),  Rusch  and  Lugowski  50b  reported  small
downshifts of ca. 30 cm-1 for all three of these modes. The difficulty of explaining these

ν   mode  (asymmetric  bend),  the  ν

1  mode

downshifts  using  the  standard  one-electron  model  has  been  recognized  as  early  as  in

1973, as seen from Jortner's remarks during the discussion at the end of refs. 50. On the
other  hand,  it  is  even  less  clear  whether  Symon's  model  3  of  the  solvent  stabilized

multimer anion of  eam

−  can account for the vibrational modes of this species.

As seen from this brief overview, further refinement of the cavity model is needed

to  account  for  the  properties  of  the  excess  electron  in  aprotic  liquids.  It  appears  that

ammonia, amines, and amides solvate the electron in a different fashion than water and

alcohols.  While  we  cannot  presently  provide  a  consistent  many-electron  model  of

2. Computational Details.

Previous work. The previously suggested ab initio models of ammoniated electron  45,46

were based on self-consistent field (SCF) Hartree-Fock (HF) calculations for small (n=2-

4), highly symmetrical cluster anions. The ammonia molecules where placed in such a

way that either one of their N-H bonds looked straight towards the cavity center, which is

designated "c" (B[bond]-orientation), or the lone pair of N looked away from this center
(D[dipole]-orientation).  Newton  45  examined  the  D2d  symmetrical  tetramer  ammonia
anion at the HF/4-31G level. All H-N-H angles were constrained to 113o, a ghost atom

was added at the center, and dielectric continuum was placed beyond an arbitrary cutoff

radius  of  2.75  Å  from  this  center.  Isotropic  hfcc  for  protons  were  estimated  for  the
3−  which corresponds to the
optimized structure; the H 1s spin density was ca -6.3x10-4  a0
hfcc of -1 G, i.e.  Σ

H A ≈ -12 G, in a reasonable agreement with the experiment (the sum
3− ,  28

totals of Fermi contact terms for H and N atoms are -3.56x10-3  a0
respectively).  Clark  and  Illing  46  used  the  HF  method  with  6-31+G* basis  set  for  real

3− and +0.954  a0

atoms complemented by an extended set of s-functions at the cavity center in order to

estimate the energetics of small cluster anions in the gas phase. Two dimer anions, B-type

one (with the C2h symmetry) and D-type one (with the D3d symmetry) and B-type trimer

anion  (with  the  C 3h  symmetry)  were  examined.  For  optimized  structures,  the  c-H
distances  were  2.5,  3.07,  and  2.47  Å,  respectively.  The  H-N-H  angle  (102-104o)  was
more acute than that for neutral ammonia molecules in the same HF model (ca. 107o).
Clark and Illing,  46 like Newton 45 before them, were mainly interested in the energetics

of these cluster anions. Still, their model suggested that the hfcc for the protons was small

and negative. The authors, however, observed that SCF calculations with split-valence

basis sets typically result in unreliable estimates for these hfcc's.

DFT  models.  In  this  study,  gas  phase  ammonia  cluster  anions  were  analyzed  using

density  functional  theory  (DFT)  models  with  BLYP  functional  (Becke's  exchange
functional 51 and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr) 52 from Gaussian 98.
53 Several other functionals (e.g., the local spin density one) were also used, with fairly

similar  results.  BLYP  functional  is  most  frequently  used  to  estimate  isotropic  hfcc  in

radicals and radical ions, for which it typically yields accurate and reliable results. Unless

specified  otherwise,  the  basis  set  was  6-31G  augmented  with  diffuse  and  polarized

functions (6-31+G**). A ghost hydrogen atom (i.e., floating-center basis functions) at the

center or a cluster of such ghost atoms inside the cavity were added. It turned out that a

single ghost atom was sufficient to provide the set of orbitals for filling the cavity. The

optimization  of  geometry  was  typically  carried  out  using  this  basis  set  or  augmented
Dunning's  correlation  consistent  quadruple  basis  set  (AUG-cc-pVQZ);  54  for  the

calculation of hfcc's and vibrational modes, the 6-31+G** basis set was used. We also
carried  out  HF  and  second-order  MØller-Plesset  (MP2)  perturbation  theory  55

calculations using the same basis sets and obtained comparable results to those obtained

using  the  DFT  methods.  This  is  reassuring  as  there  are  recognized  pitfalls  in  using

Becke's functionals for cluster anions (though these functionals are most frequently used
to model such anions;  49 for the recent criticism of the DFT approach, see Herbert and
Head-Gordon),  56  of  which  most  important  are  overbinding  for  large  basis  sets  and

underbinding for small basis sets.

Some hfcc estimates in the DFT model were obtained using Barone's triple zeta
basis set with diffuse functions (EPR-III), 57 but these estimates were very close to those

obtained using the 6-31+G** basis set and, therefore, are not reported herein. It appears

that HF, MP, and DFT methods, regardless of the exact implementation and the choice of

the  basis  set,  yield  the  same  basic  electronic  structure  for  ammonia  anions.  For  this

reason, only DFT models are considered henceforward.

All calculations discussed below were performed for gas phase cluster anions. We

emphasize that these model species do not resemble at all the electron-trapping clusters

observed  in  the  gas  phase  (which,  as  suggested  by  the  recent  studies  of  small  water
cluster anions, 58,59 dipole-bound the electron at their surface). 58 The species of interest to
−  in

us is the core of a much larger cluster anion that traps the electron in its interior or  eam

the bulk solvent. Some calculations were carried out using polarized continuum model of
Tomasi et al. 60 in a similar fashion to Newton's model. 45 The main effect of introducing

the continuum seems to be the tightening of the cluster. This contraction of the cavity
leads, inter alia, to more negative hfcc's for the protons and greater hfcc's for the  14N

nuclei.  The  effect  of  dielectric  continuum  on  the  partition  of  the  highest  occupied

molecular orbital (HOMO) between the cavity and nitrogen atoms is small; most of the

spin density remains in the N orbitals. Since such semicontinuum models depend on the

arbitrary  partitioning  between  the  molecules  and  the  "media"  around  them  and  do  not

capture the effect of hydrogen bonding between the solvent molecules in the first and the

second solvation shells (that changes orientations of N-H bonds at the cavity wall), there

is almost no practical value to such calculations. Hence we focus only on those aspects of
−   in

the gas phase DFT models that are likely to relate to the observed properties of  eam

liquid. For the same reason, we did not focus on the energetics of such gas phase clusters,

as such energetics would bear little relation to that of the core anion in liquid ammonia.

Our scope is limited only to the structural properties of this core anion; the energetics of

solvation cannot be addressed using this crude approach.

Two  basic  geometries  for  ammonia  clusters  anions  (n=2-8)  were  examined.  In

both of these geometries, the ammonia molecules were placed radially around the center

(c). In the star-shaped B-type anions (e.g., anion 1 in Figure 1), one of the hydrogens (Ha)

of each monomer looked towards the center (i.e., the Ha-c-N angle was constrained to
180o); the two other hydrogens (Hb) pointed away from this center, so that the c-Ha-N-H
dihedral angles are ca. 124o (Table 1). In the D-type clusters (e.g., anion 2 in Figure 2),
the Ha-c-N angles varied between 11o and 20o and the c-Ha-N-Hb dihedral angles were ca.
54o: all three hydrogens pointed towards the center. In the gas phase, small D-type anions

have  lower  energy  than  B-type  anions,  because  this  dipole  orientation  maximizes  the

attraction between H atoms and the electron in the cavity and minimizes the repulsion

between the negatively charged nitrogens in the monomers. For n=2, 3, and 4 anions, a

mirror  plane  symmetry  was  assumed,  for  n=4,  6  and  8  anions,  the  nitrogens  were

arranged on the tetrahedral, octahedral, and cubic patterns, respectively. In these anions,

all  ammonia  monomers  had  the  same  geometry  and  were  placed  at  the  same  distance

from  the  cavity  center,  so  there  were  typically  only  three  groups  of  magnetically

equivalent nuclei (N, Ha, and Hb, see Figure 1).

Since the definition of what constitutes the cavity in a many-electron model of

ammoniated  electron  is  ambiguous,  it  is  difficult  to  quantify  the  partition  of  the  spin

density  between  the  cavity  and  the  solvent  molecules  exactly.  Examination  of  density

maps for HOMO of the cluster anions suggests that the electron wavefunction inside the

cavity and in the frontier orbitals of N atoms has opposite signs, which makes it easy to

distinguish  these  two  contributions.  Qualitatively,  this  partition  can  be  assessed  by

examination of isodensity contour maps of spin-bearing HOMO of the anions (like that

shown below in Figures 3 and 4). Typically, the diffuse, positive part of HOMO occupies
80-90% of the geometrical cavity at the density of +(0.01-0.03) e Å-3 and less than 10%
at the density of +(0.035-0.4) e Å-3.

3.1.  The  neutral  monomer.  In  the  BLYP/6-31+G**  model  of  the  C3v  symmetrical
ammonia  molecule,  the  H-N  bond  is  1.025  Å  and  the  H-N-H  angle  is  107.5o.  These

parameters may be compared with the crystallographic data for solid ammonia-I: 1.012 Å
and  107.53o,  respectively.  24  The  calculated  vibrational  modes  are  in  a  reasonable
agreement  with  the  experimental  ones  (Table  2).  The  symmetrical  stretch  (ν

asymmetrical bend (ν

4 ) modes are least affected by the transfer from the gas to the liquid

phase (in liquid, the frequencies change significantly due to the hydrogen bonding, with
the mean H-N…H distance of 2.357 Å); 24 these two modes are accurately estimated at

the  BLYP/6-31+G**  level.  In  the  anion  clusters  examined  below,  the  excess  electron

bonding  to  ammonia  molecules  in  the  second  solvation  shell.  Since  in  the  gas-phase

cluster anions (i) most of the excess electron density is on the nitrogen atoms and (ii) the

second solvation shell is lacking, D-type orientation is favored energetically. We have

examined  the  lowest-energy  B-type  anions  nevertheless,  as  such  anions  may  still  be

realized in liquid ammonia. The geometry of the clusters is summarized in Table 1 and

the optimized structures are shown in Figures 1 through 6.

3.2.  Dimer.  The  lowest  energy  B-type  dimer  anion  1  (Figure  1,  vide  supra) has C2h

symmetry; the D-type dimer anion 2 (Figure 1, vide infra)  has D3d symmetry and is ca.
≈ 1.43 Å vs. 2.9

150 meV more stable than anion 1. Anion 1 is very tight (with  r c Ha

−

)

(

Å in anion 2) and, consequently, the spin density on N atoms is 50-70% greater than in

medium size cluster anions. The N-H bond lengths, however, are fairly close to those in

the neutral molecule: 1.026 and 1.030 Å in anion 1 and 1.026 Å in anion 2 (Table 1). The
H-N-H angles are the smallest among all of the structures examined: 103-104o in anion 1
and 102.4o in anion 2. The Mulliken charge and spin densities on nitrogen atoms are large

(-1.52 and 0.62 for anion 1 and -1.68 and 0.77 for anion 2, respectively (Table 1). Despite

the large positive charge and spin density on Ha protons in anion 1 (+0.44 and -0.088,

respectively) vs. anion 2 (+0.37 and -0.064, respectively), the isotropic hfcc's on these
protons are similar, -2.7 vs. -2.4 G, and isotropic hfcc's for 14N are also comparable, 27.7

vs. 22.9 G (Table 1). The anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants for the protons are ca.

2 times larger in anion 1 than in anion 2, as may be expected from the small size of anion

1. As the tensors of anisotropic hyperfine interaction are approximately axial (i.e., the
(
principal values are  +

), these can be characterized by the largest principal

)

,

value  2T ,  which  is  ca.  6  G  for  1H  in  anion  1  vs.  3.3  G  in  anion  2  (Table  1).  The
anisotropy of hyperfine interaction for 14N nuclei is small in both of these dimer anions
< 1.2  G),  and  it  further  decreases  with  size  in  larger  anions  (Table  1).  The  total

( 2TN
isotropic hfcc on 14N and 1H nuclei are 55.4 G and -12 G in anion 1 and 45.7 G and -14.4

G in anion 2, respectively. Notice that both the total atomic spin density and the isotropic

hfcc's for the protons are negative. The charge density on the central ghost atom is fairly

low (-0.1 for 1 and -0.15 for 2), i.e. the charge and spin densities are mainly on the N

atoms.  Using  more  diffuse  functions  in  the  basis  set  does  not  change  this  partitioning

appreciably. In the calculated Raman spectrum of anion 1, the strongest bands are 3352
cm-1 (Bu) and 3208 cm-1 (Ag), there are also two weaker bands at 1635 and 3420 cm-1,

both of which are Bg modes (Table 3). Thus, the asymmetric bend does not change and

the stretch modes are strongly downshifted (Tables 2 and 3). While these dimer anions
− , many of the features observed for these dimer anions

are poor reference models for  eam

are also observed for larger cluster anions.

3.3. Trimer. The lowest energy B- and D- type trimer anions both have C3h  symmetry

(anions 3 (vide supra) and 4 (vide infra) in Figure 2, respectively); the former is ca. 160
meV more energetic than the latter. The H-N-H angle are still rather small (104o in anion
1 and 103o in anion 2) and the N-H bonds are elongated (1.035 and 1.041 Å in anion 1

and 1.034 Å in anion  2); see Table 1. The c-Ha distance increases, as compared to the

dimer  anions,  to  1.9  Å  in  anion  3 and 2.38 Å in anion 4.  Though  the  spin  is  equally

divided between the three nitrogens (rather than two nitrogens in anions 1 and 2),  the
total isotropic hfcc on 14N and 1H nuclei is not too different from that in the dimer anions
< 1 G) whereas those on the  1Ha
(Table 1). The anisotropic hfcc for 14N are small ( 2TN

nuclei  are  still  relatively  large  ( 2TH
isotropic  hfcc's  on  the  protons  are  small (Table  2)  and  the  constants  for  14N are large

≈3.1  G  for  anion 3  and  4.5  G  for  anion 4).  The

(+20.7  G  for  anion 3  and  +17.7  G  for  anion 4). While the geometry, spin and charge

densities are sensitive to the choice of the basis set, especially when tight-binding sets
(such as 4-31G and 6-31G) are used, the total hfcc's on  14N and 1H nuclei change only

within 20%. The main effect of tight-binding is to make the anion tighter; the partitioning

of the excess electron density between the three nitrogen atoms and the "cavity" changes

relatively little. The same applies to other ammonia anions.

3.4.  Tetramer.  Both  planar  C 4h symmetrical  clusters  and  "tetrahedral"  (D2d)  clusters
(analogous to those studied by Newton) 45 were examined. The tightest of these clusters

is  a  ring  anion  5  shown  in  Figure  3  (top left), with extended hydrogen bonds (HN..H

distance of 2.25 Å) between the monomers and c-Ha separation of only 1.88 Å (Table 1).

This cluster is so tight that the positive spin density from the cavity-filling part of the

wavefunction compensates the negative contribution due to the bond polarization, and the
isotropic hfcc on Ha is slightly positive, +0.28 G. The resulting total isotropic hfcc on 14N
and 1H nuclei are 80.7 G and -2.2 G, respectively. In larger anions, all hfcc on the protons

are negative (Table 1). Anion 5 is by ca. 125 meV more energetic than star-shaped anion

6  (Figure 5, top right), which, in turn, is by ca. 150 meV more energetic than the D2d

symmetric anion 7 (Figure 5, top left). Isodensity HOMO maps for C4h symmetric anions

are shown in Figures 3 (bottom right) and 4 (both for anion 6) and Figure 1S (for anion

8). D-type anion 8 (with the C4h symmetry; see Fig. 4, bottom left) and anion 9 (with the

D2d symmetry; see Figure  5,  top  right)  are  isoenergetic  and  by  ca.  100  meV  lower  in
energy than anion 7. The total isotropic hfcc on 14N is +(50-65) G (i.e., the average hfcc
for 14N is 13-16 G) and that for the protons is between -5.4 G (for anion 6) and -12.3 G

(for  anion  9);  see  Table  1.  The  latter  parameter  is  systematically  greater  for  D-type

structures  since  there  is  no  compensation  of  the  negative  hfcc  constants  (due  to  the

interaction with the cavity electron) for inner Ha protons in such anions. The anisotropic
<  0.5-
hyperfine interaction for 14N is weaker than in the dimer and trimer anions  ( 2TN

0.7 G) and the protons are almost purely dipole coupled. Mulliken charge density on the

N atoms is ca. -1.11 and the spin density is ca. 0.23-0.27. While the c-Ha distances vary
between 2.12 Å (in anion 6) and 3.04 (in anion 9), the mean isotropic hfcc's on 14N and
1H for these two tetramer anions are comparable (Table 1) reflecting the fact that the spin

density is divided mainly between the ammonia molecules. The spin density inside the

cavity is relatively small and there is a node at the center, as seen from the isodensity

HOMO maps shown in Figures 4 and 5 (see also detailed maps in Figures 1S and 2S) For

all of the anions examined, most of the spin density is in the frontier orbitals of N atoms.

For  comparison  to  B-type  dimer  anion  1,  it  is  instructive  to  examine  vibration

modes in B-type anion 6. The calculated Raman spectrum is dominated by the three Bg
bands  at  1080,  1629,  and  3201  cm-1  that  correspond  to  ν

1  modes  of  the

4 ,  and  ν

2 ,  ν

neutral ammonia (Table 3). Once more, the asymmetric bend is relatively unchanged and
the symmetric stretch is downshifted by ca. 170 cm-1. For D-type anion 8, the two most
prominent Raman modes are at 1633 and 3248 cm-1. The looser is the anion, the closer

are the vibration frequencies to those of a neutral ammonia molecule.

3.5. Hexamer and octamer. Octahedral hexamer and cubic octamer anions are perhaps

most instructive to examine because the coordination number of ammoniated electron, as
suggested by PIMC models, 17 is six to nine.

In  the  Ci symmetrical B-type anion 10  (Fig. 6, top  left),  the  c-Ha distances are

2.42  Å,  and  in  D-type  anion  11 (Fig.  6,  top right), these distances are 3.3-3.4 Å (this

anion has ca. 195 meV lower energy than anion 10). The N-H bonds in the monomers are

1.03 Å (which is close to 1.025 Å in a neutral molecule) and the H-N-H angles are ca.
104.5o (vs. 107.5o in a neutral molecule). The total isotropic hfcc  Σ
N A  on  14N is +50 G

for anion 11 and +63.4 G for anion 10, respectively; the total hfcc  Σ

H A on the protons is

-6.8 G for anion 10 and -13.2 G for anion 11, respectively (the tighter is the cluster anion,
the  less  negative  is  Σ

H A  and  the  more  positive  is  Σ

N A).  Isodensity  maps  of  singly

occupied  HOMO  (SOMO)  shown  in Figure 3S indicate that the octahedral "cavity" is

filled  by  the  electron  wavefunction  (with  a  node  at  the  center),  but  most  of  the  spin

density is divided between the frontier orbitals of N atoms (with Mulliken charge density

of  ca  -1.0  and  spin  density  of  0.15-0.17;  see  Table  1).  To  determine  the  effect  of

symmetry  breaking  on  the  hfcc's,  the  constraints  were  relaxed  and  several  optimized

structures were analyzed (see, e.g., Figure 4S). Despite the wide variation in the shape,

bonding, and partitioning of the electron bonding between the nitrogens in the monomers,
the total isotropic hfcc on 14N and 1H nuclei demonstrate surprisingly little variation. E.g.,
for the hexamer anion shown in Figure 4S, these constants are  Σ
H A ≈ -

N A ≈ 54.2 G and  Σ

12.1 G, respectively. For D-type anions, the anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants are

fairly close to those calculated in the point dipole approximation; e.g., for anion 11,  2T
for 14N and 1H nuclei are 0.64 and 1.4 G, respectively. The mean isotropic hfcc for 14N

nuclei is typically around 10 G (vs. experimental 11±0.5 G for ammoniated F-center on
MgO). 44

Magnetic parameters for B-type anion 10 vs. the c-Ha distance are given in Figure

7 and Table 1S (the structures were optimized for all other degrees of freedom). As this
distance increases from 2 to 3 Å,  Σ

N A decreases from 78 to 52 G and  Σ

H A increases

from  -8.4  to  -6.4  G.  As  seen  from  Figure  7,  the  hfcc's  on  outer  protons  change  very

slightly; the hfcc's on the inner protons change from -1 to -0.65 G. The total spin density

on  N  atoms  actually  increases  as  the  monomers  move  out,  but  the  frontier  N  orbitals
exhibit  progressively  more  prominent  p-character  and  the  hfcc  on  14N  nuclei  (that  is

sensitive only to the s-character) decreases. As seen from the comparison of Table 1 and
Table 1S, the average isotropic and anisotropic hfcc's on 14N nuclei depend largely on the

c-N distance rather than a specific arrangement of the monomers around the cavity or
their  number.  This  suggests  that  hfcc  constants  for  14N  nuclei  in  the  second  solvation

shell would not be negligible.

Cubic  D-  and  B-type  octamer  anions  have  either  D 4  or  C 4h symmetries.  For

undistorted cubic anions, B-type anion has the lower energy; however, when elongation

along the fourfold symmetry axis is allowed, D-type anion has lower energy. In the D4

symmetrical B-type anion 12 (Fig. 6, bottom left), the c-Ha distance is 2.75 Å vs. 3.11 Å
in  the  D-type  anion  13  (Fig.  6, bottom right).  For  the  latter,  the  parameters  Σ

N A  and

Σ

H A are similar to those for D-type hexamer 11 (Table 1); for B-type anion 12, these two

parameters are +70.3 and -6.33 G, respectively. The anisotropy of hfcc on the nitrogens is
< 0.5  G)  and  for  the  protons  the  anisotropic  coupling  constants  are

very  small  ( 2TN

comparable to those in the hexamer anions. Representative isodensity maps of HOMO

for  B-type  anion  12  are  shown  in Figure 8.  The  spin  density  resides  mainly  on  the  N

atoms but there is also a diffuse orbital filling the elongated cavity with a pronounced p-

character.  The  calculated  Raman  spectrum  of  this  anion  (Table  3)  is  dominated  by  a
single 3265-3267 cm-1 band corresponding to the symmetric stretch (which is by ca. 100
cm-1 downshifted from a free ammonia molecule). The asymmetrical bend modes are spit

into two branches; some of these are upshifted and some downshifted (Table 3). In B-

type clusters, the downshifted modes are more prevalent, whereas in D-type clusters both

of  these  two  branches  are  present.  It  is  difficult  to  predict  from  these  data  the  overall
ν   mode  in  the  actual  IR  and  Raman

effect  of  charge  sharing  on  the  combined  2 4

spectrum, but it is certain that this effect is relatively small and favors downshifts for N-H

bonds pointing towards the cavity center.

Of all the multimer anions examined above only B-type octamer 12 seems to have

a bound excited state, as suggested by time-dependent DFT calculations in the random

phase approximation (for the BLYP/6-31+G** model). The transition is by 80% from the

highest occupied to the lowest unoccupied MO; it is at 1.2 eV and it has the oscillator

strength of 0.23. While it is encouraging that such a simple model predicts a bound-to-

bound transition in the near IR, this lowest unoccupied MO consists of N 2p orbitals. It is

− .
unlikely that this transition has any bearing on the observed optical spectrum of  eam

4. Discussion and Conclusions.

Our results suggest that the charge and spin density in small, highly symmetrical
−  clusters  is  preferentially  divided  between  the  frontier  orbitals  of  N  atoms  of  the

amn

cavity-forming ammonia molecules. Regardless of how many monomers are involved in
the anion core, this partition results in the total isotropic hfcc of +(55-80) G on 14N and -
(6-13) G on 1H. Although in these model calculations, almost no spin density resided in
N A ≈ +110 G
the "cavity", the total hfcc on 14N nuclei was still lower  than the value of  Σ
− . 3,28 This apparent contradiction can be resolved by assuming, following

obtained for  eam
Symons,  3  that  in  addition  to  the  large  (+(8-12)  G)  hfcc's  for  14N  nuclei  in  the  6-9

ammonia molecules forming the solvation cavity, there are small hfcc's for 14N nuclei in

the 12-20 ammonia molecules that constitute the second solvation shell.

The most likely effect of this second solvation shell and the liquid behind it on the

core  anion  would  be  the  constriction  of  the  solvation  cavity.  Such  an  effect  can  be
obtained even in crude semicontinuum models. 45,60 In terms of the magnetic parameters,
this  constriction  will  increase  Σ

H A  more  negative  (see  Table  1S  and

N A  and  make  Σ

Figure  7).  While  it  is  presently  impossible  to  assess  quantitatively  the  effect  of  this

constriction  (see  below),  there  is  no  obvious  way  in  which  the  standard  one-electron
cavity model can explain the observed Knight shifts for 14N nuclei. Furthermore, only by

transferring spin density into N 2p orbitals can one obtain negative hfcc's on the protons,

as was suggested previously in refs. 3, 45, and 46 and further demonstrated in this study.

With the DFT calculations, there is always a possibility that unorthodox results

are the artifact of tight-binding, and this problem is especially dire for solvated electron

as most of the density is outside the solvent molecules. Nothing in our results suggest that

this is the case for ammonia anions. Introduction of additional sets of diffuse functions

and ghost atoms does not have large effect on how the spin density is divided between the

cavity  and  ammonia  molecules.  Analogous  DFT  calculations  for  small  water  and
methanol clusters do yield cavity electrons at the same level of modeling. 49, 57, 61 The fact

that the solvation of electron in ammonia clusters is qualitatively different from that in

water and methanol clusters has been suggested, albeit indirectly, by DFT calculations of
sodium containing neutral clusters by Ferro and Allouche 62 and HF and MP calculations
of Hashimoto and Morokuma. 63 In Na(H2O)7-10 and Na/methanol clusters, 62 the Na  3s

electron is located far from the sodium nucleus; it can be regarded as a surface-trapped
electron. By contrast, calculations of Na(NH3)6-11 clusters 62,63 indicated that the electron

density  was  divided  between  the  frontier  orbitals  of  N  atoms  in  ammonia  molecules

solvating Na, in a manner strikingly resembling the anions examined in section 3. This

partitioning of the excess electron density among the ammonia molecules seems to be the

natural  result  of  DFT  and  ab  initio  modeling  rather  than  an  artifact  of  specific

implementation of the model.

For  hexamer  and  octamer  anions  (that  most  closely  resemble  the  core  of

ammoniated  electron),  anisotropic  hyperfine  coupling  constants  are  comparable  with

those  estimated  in  the  point-dipole  approximation,  suggesting  inefficient  nuclear
relaxation  due  to  such  anisotropy,  in  agreement  with  the  experiment.  28,36,41,42  The

calculations  also  suggest  small  downshift  for  asymmetric  bending  modes  (for  B-type

anions)  and  relatively  large  downshift  for  symmetric  stretching  modes.  Qualitatively,
these  results  are  in  agreement  with  the  experimental  picture  47,48 for hydrated electron

(see  the  Introduction).  The  magnitude  of  the  stretch  mode  downshift  depends  on  the

extent of delocalization of the electron between the ammonia molecules. Our analyses

suggest that delocalization between 6-8 molecules already reduces this shift to 100-120
cm-1 (Tables 2 and 3). As the NMR results indicate that even more electron delocalization
−  (via the involvement of the second solvation shell, see above), the

should occur in  eam

downshift will reduce further. It seems entirely plausible that the resulting shift will be
comparable  to  the  experimental  estimate  of  ca.  30  cm-1. 50b  The  DFT  calculations

specifically point  to  the population of frontier  N orbitals  as  the  cause of the observed

downshift  and  account,  within  the  limitations  of  the  model,  for  the  scale  of  this

downshift.

The weak point of our model is its inability to address the optical properties and
−  that are precisely the properties that one-electron models tackle so

the energetics of  eam

well.  This  inability  is  not  inherent  to  the  DFT  methodology:  it  is  the  consequence  of

limitations of our particular model, namely, the fact that we focused on small gas phase

anions with fixed geometry. The real test would be a large-scale model in which DFT

method  is  coupled  to  molecular  dynamics,  as  in  the  recently  published  Car-Parrinello
calculation of hydrated electron. 64 In the absence of such a test, the model is incomplete,

despite the suggestive indications that it captures the physics of the problem. We can,

however, offer the following qualitative argument suggesting that the optical properties

will be adequately accounted for in advanced DFT models. From the standpoint of one-
−   is  an  electron  inside  a  (nearly)  spherical  potential
electron cavity models,  5-11,17-23  eam

well. At the same level of idealization, the solvent-stabilized anion in ammonia can be

viewed  as  an  electron  in  a  potential  well  that  is  shaped  as  a  thin  spherical  layer  (of

nitrogen  atoms  in  the  first  solvation  shell),  with  some  extension  of  the  wavefunction

towards  the  center  of  the  cavity  and  towards  the  outside.  Since  both  of  these  binding

potentials  are  spherically  symmetrical,  the  ground  and  excited  states  are  s  and p

functions, in both of these two models. By suitable parameterization of these potentials

and  by  allowing  certain  variation  in  these  parameters,  similar  optical  spectra  can  be

obtained. Therefore, at the conceptual level it is very difficult to tell these two variants of

the one-electron model apart.

We conclude that at some level of idealization, the many-electron and the one-
−  may look rather similar, provided that only a subset of the

electron cavity model of  eam

properties  of  ammoniated  electron  is  taken  into  account.  In  one  model,  the  cavity  is

formed due to the Coulomb repulsion between the solvent molecules sharing the negative

charge; the excess electron resides on the frontier orbitals of N atoms at the surface of the

cavity. In another model, the electron fills up the interstitial void and forms its own cavity

via  Pauli  repulsion  of  the  solvent  molecules.  From  the  structural  perspective,  the  end

result (the cavity of a certain size) is the same. From the standpoint of the energetics, the

end result (a spherically symmetrical potential well and the resulting absorption spectrum

in the IR) is also the same. Hence the success of one-electron models in explaining some

− .
properties of  eam

In such a situation, the definitive test of the model is in its ability to reproduce the

specific structural information, such as the spin density map given by the Knight shifts.

For ammonia, this evidence points away from the cavity-filling one-electron model and

towards, at the very least, the spherical-shell one-electron model, which has its natural

explanation in the multimer radical anion model examined above.

How general are these conclusions? Large Knight shifts for 14N and 13C nuclei for
excess electron in dilute Na/methylamine solutions 31 suggest that solvation of electron

by the amino- and methyl- groups is qualitatively similar to that in ammoniated electron.
We  have  already  suggested  that  electron  solvation  in  alkanes  65  and  acetonitrile  66

involves a solvent stabilized multimer anion with a fraction of the spin density transferred

onto the frontier orbitals of C atoms in the methyl groups. It is very likely that similar

situation occurs in ethers, as such liquids also solvate the electron by their methyl and
methylene groups. 68

The mode of electron solvation in the alkanes (that comprise the largest class of

electron trapping liquids) can be addressed experimentally, in two different ways. First, it
might be possible to determine Knight shifts for 13C nuclei in dilute Na/HMPA solutions.
Catterall et al.  32 have already determined these shifts for 31P and 14N nuclei in HMPA;

the small magnitude of these shifts and the fact that the absorption band of the electron is
at 2.3 µm 33,34 suggest that the electron is solvated by methyl groups, with the polar P=O

group  looking  away  from  the  cavity  (in  a  similar  fashion  to  the  solvated  electron  in
acetonitrile). 66,67 The predicted observation of large Knight shift on  13C nuclei in this

liquid would provide the direct evidence as to the occurrence of spin sharing by methyl
groups. Alternatively, it might be possible to determine spin densities on  13C nuclei in
13CH3  labeled  glass-forming  branched  hydrocarbons  that  are  known  to  trap  electrons
below 77 K. 65,69 So far, the emphasis of the EPR and electron spin echo studies was to
determine  anisotropic  hfcc  on  the  cavity  protons.  69  Our  models  suggest  that  a
measurement of isotropic hfcc on 13C nuclei would be a more direct probe of the mode of

electron trapping. Equally important would be revisiting the EPR of hydrated electrons
trapped  in  alkaline  ices  70  since  hyperfine  couplings  for  17O  nuclei  for  the  hydrated

electron have never been determined and thus quantitative estimates as to the degree of

penetration of the electron density on the frontier orbitals of oxygen atoms are lacking.

Considerable downshifts for bending and stretching modes in the Raman spectra of the
hydrated electron 47,48 and prominent 180 nm absorption band in its optical spectrum 71

provide  indirect  evidence  for  partial  occupation  of  these  orbitals  by  the  electron.  The

distinction between the cavity electron and the solvent stabilized multimer anion might be

a matter of degree only.

B-type dimer anion 1 (the C2h symmetry; vide supra) and D-type dimer anion 2 (the D3d

symmetry;  vide  infra);  "c"  is  the  inversion  center.  The  two  groups  of  magnetically

equivalent protons are designated Ha (inner protons) and Hb (outer protons). Here and in

other figures, the structures given have the lowest energy in the BLYP/6-31+G** density
functional model. The structural and magnetic parameters for 14N and 1H nuclei for these

anions are given in Table 1.

Optimized geometry for the C3h symmetrical B-type trimer anion 3 (vide supra) and D-

type  trimer  anion  4  (vide  infra).  The  dashed  lines  point  from  the  center  of  mass  "c"

towards Ha protons (highlighted for anion 4).

Isodensity surfaces for singly occupied HOMO of B-type tetramer anion 6 (the isodensty

surfaces  for  anions  7 an 8  are  given  in  Figures  2S  and  1S,  respectvely).  Red  is  for

positive density, pink is for negative density. The surfaces correspond to (a) ±0.01, (b)
±0.02, (c) ±0.03, and (d) ±0.04 e Å-3. The cross marks the center of mass. Most of the

spin density is in the frontier orbitals of N atoms; the diffuse positive wavefunction that

envelops the anion has a node at the center.

The same as Fig. 4, for the C4h symmetrical D-type tetramer anion 8.

The same as Fig. 4, for the D2d symmetrical B-type tetramer anion 7. The surfaces are
densities corresponding to (a) ±0.01, (b) ±0.025, (c) ±0.03, and (d) ±0.035 e Å-3.

The same as Fig. 2S, for the Ci symmetrical B-type hexamer anion 10.

One  of  the  hexamer  anions  with  a  loose  octahedral  pattern  obtained  with  relaxed
constraints. Some ammonia molecules are B-oriented, some are D-oriented. Despite the
absence of order, the total hfcc's on  14N and 1H nuclei show relatively little variation in
such loose clusters.

See the legend for Table 1 for units and notations used.  ∆E  is the energy relative to the
optimized anion. a(Ha-N-Hb) is ca. 104.80, r(N-Hb) is ca. 1.03 Å, and ρc(Hb) is ca. 0.28 e
Å-3 for all of these structures. Mean isotropic and anisotropic hfcc's for 14N and 1H nuclei
are in Gauss (1 G = 10-4 T).

Abstract 
A  self-consistent  1-D  model  was  developed  to  study  the  effect  of  the  electron  energy 
distribution function (EEDF) on power deposition and plasma density profiles in a planar inductively 
coupled plasma (ICP) in the non-local regime (pressure ≤ 10  mTorr). The  model consisted of three 
modules: (1) an electron energy distribution function (EEDF) module to compute the non-Maxwellian 
EEDF,  (2)  a  non-local  electron  kinetics  module  to  predict  the  non-local  electron  conductivity,  RF 
current,  electric  field  and  power  deposition  profiles  in  the  non-uniform  plasma,  and  (3)  a  heavy 
species transport module to solve for the ion density and velocity profiles  as  well as the  metastable 
density.  Results  using  the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF  model  were  compared  with  predictions  using  a 
Maxwellian  EEDF,  under  otherwise  identical  conditions.  The  RF  electric  field,  current,  and  power 
deposition  profiles  were  different,  especially  at  1mTorr,  for  which  the  electron  effective  mean  free 
path was larger than the skin depth. The plasma density predicted by the Maxwellian EEDF was up to 
93% larger for the conditions examined. Thus, the non-Maxwellian EEDF must be accounted for in 
modeling ICPs at very low pressures. 

 
 
1.0 INTRODUCTION 
Inductively  coupled  plasma  (ICP)  sources  are  used 
extensively  for  etching  and  deposition  of  thin  films  in 
microelectronics manufacturing. Such sources can produce 
a  high-density,  uniform  plasma  in  a  low  pressure  gas 
without the need for external magnetic fields [1,2,3,4,5]. 

At  relatively  high  pressures  (above  ≈  20  mTorr), 
electrons  in  an  ICP  discharge  are  heated  by  collisional 
dissipation  of  wave  energy.  Power  deposition  in  lower 
pressure  discharges,  however,  involves  a  collisionless 
electron  heating  mechanism  [6,7].  It  has  been  suggested 
that this is due to a (cid:147)warm plasma(cid:148) effect analogous to the 
anomalous skin effect in metals [4,8].  

The anomalous skin effect in 1-D gas discharges has 
been studied theoretically for both semi-infinite and infinite 
systems  [9,10,11].  Early  experimental  investigation  of  the 
skin effect was performed by Demirkhanov et al. [12]. The 
anomalous  skin  effect  in  1-D  bounded  plasmas  has  also 
been  studied  both 
theoretically  and  experimentally 
interesting  effect  associated  with 
[13,14,15,16].  An 
bounded  plasmas  is  the  possible  resonance  between  the 
wave  frequency  and  the  motion  of  electrons  bouncing 
between  the  walls.  This  can  lead  to  enhanced  (resonant) 

heating  [15,17,18].  Most  theoretical  results  reported  thus  far 
for  a  bounded  plasma  assume  a  uniform  plasma  density, 
where the electrostatic potential well is flat in the plasma and 
infinite  at  the  wall  (to  simulate  the  existence  of  sheaths).  In 
this square potential well, electrons are reflected back into the 
plasma only at the discharge walls. In a realistic non-uniform 
plasma,  however,  the  electron  turning  points  will  depend  on 
the electron total (kinetic plus potential) energy and the actual 
shape  of  the  potential  well,  i.e.,  low  total  energy  electrons 
bounce  back  at  locations  within  the  plasma.  Although 
theoretical treatments of non-uniform slab plasmas have been 
reported [10,27], results related to such plasmas are lacking. 
A review of classical and recent works on the anomalous skin 
effect in plasmas was made in [19, 20]. 

At  low  pressures,  when  the  electron  mean  free  path  is 
comparable  to  the  discharge  size,  kinetic  effects  come  into 
play,  and 
function  can  be 
substantially non-Maxwellian [21]. 

the  electron  distribution 

Kinetic  effects  can  be  modeled  using  Monte  Carlo  or 
Particle-In-Cell  (PIC)  approaches,  but  these  tend  to  be 
computationally  intensive  [22].  Besides,  the  direct  use  of 
conventional PIC-MCC for modeling of high-density ICP can 
be  problematic  due  to  the  statistical  noise  in  the  charge  and 
current  density.  In  Ref.23  the  traditional  PIC  approach  was 
modified  to  reduced  noise.  This  was  based  on  consideration 

1

 

 

of  correlations  in  electron  motion  with  and  without  RF 
electric  and  magnetic  fields.  Additional  reduction  of  the 
statistical noise was achieved using the condition of plasma 
quasineutrality.  

Alternative  (cid:147)fast  modeling(cid:148)  techniques  [24,25,26] 
make  use  of  analytical  theory,  and  employ  a  number  of 
simplifications, which can offer considerable improvement 
in  computational  time.  This  method  has  been  successfully 
employed  in  the  study  of  non-Maxwellian  EEDFs  in  low-
pressure  RF  capacitive  discharges  as  well  [24,25].  These 
approaches  use  the  so-called  quasi-linear  theory  [27,28], 
applied when the electron drift velocity is smaller than their 
thermal  velocity,  which  is  typical  for  low  temperature 
discharges.  However, nonlinear effects which arise due to 
interaction of electrons with transverse magnetic fields [29] 
near  the  boundary  of  the  discharge  can  dampen  electron 
heating, especially at the limit of electron-neutral collision 
ν →   [30].  Such  nonlinear  effects  were  not 
frequency 
treated in this article.

In  a  previous  paper,  a  self-consistent  model  of 
non-local electron kinetics and heavy species transport in a 
1-D  slab  (bounded)  plasma  was  presented  [31].  An  argon 
discharge  was  studied  incorporating  both  electron  impact 
reactions  and  metastable  chemistry.  This  model  is  used 
here  to  examine  the  effect  of  electron  energy  distribution 
function (EEDF) on power deposition profiles and plasma 
density.  Special  attention  was  paid  to  the  effects  of 
collisionless heating on the EEDF.  

 
2.0 MODEL DESCRIPTION 
A  schematic  of  a  1-D  parallel  plate  symmetric 
discharge  (plate  separation  L)  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Current 
sheets (not shown) on either side of the plasma, driven by a 
radio frequency (RF) source, generate a transverse RF field 
Ey heating the plasma electrons. The RF field amplitude at 
the plasma edges is E0; this value is set by the magnitude of 
the  RF  current  and  directly  affects  the  total  power 
deposited  in  the  plasma.  The  RF  field  is  attenuated  by 
power transfer to the plasma electrons. Most of the power 
is deposited near the edge in what is called the (cid:147)skin layer.(cid:148)  
An  electrostatic  (space  charge)  field  Esc(x)  in  the  x-
direction  develops  to  confine  electrons  in  the  plasma  and 
equalize  the  electron  and  ion  current  to  the  walls.    The 
electron  potential  energy  corresponding  to  this  field  is 
shown  schematically  in  Fig.  2.  Electrons  with  sufficiently 
low total (x-kinetic plus potential) energy will be reflected 
*  for 
by this potential well. The reflection points x1
an electron  with total energy  ε are shown in Fig. 2. Thus, 
low  energy  electrons  are  confined  near  the  discharge 
center,  but  higher  energy  electrons  can  reach  further 
towards the walls. The sheath near the physical boundaries 
was  not  accounted  for  explicitly.  Because  of  the  high 
plasma density the sheath is  only 100s of  µm thick. Thus, 
the location of the sheath edge is essentially at the physical 
boundary, and the plasma approximation ni=ne was applied 
to  the  whole  domain.  An  infinite  potential  barrier  was 
assumed for the sheath. Electrons with total energy higher 
than  the  potential  at  the  sheath  edge  ϕsh  were  assumed  to 

* and x2

reflect  at  the  physical  boundary,  the  underlying  assumption 
being that the electron current to the  wall  was considered to 
be negligible. 

Since  non-local  behavior  is  a  warm  plasma  effect, 
kinetic  treatment  of  electron  transport  is  necessary.  When 
electrons are warm enough to be transported out of the (cid:147)skin 
layer(cid:148) during an RF cycle, power is said to be deposited non-
locally.  In  a  sense,  the  current  at  a  given  location  is 
influenced  by  the  field  at  all  other  locations.  In  contrast,  in 
the local case, the current at a given location only depends on 
the field at that particular point (Ohm(cid:146)s law). Non-locality is

For pressures typically smaller than 10 mTorr for argon, 
the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) can be non-
Maxwellian  [21].  Hence,  for  accurate  calculation  of  power 
deposition  and  species  density  at  low  pressures,  the  EEDF 
needs  to  be  computed.  The  following  section  describes  a 
model  for  computing  the  EEDF  for  a  low  pressure  argon 
plasma  in  which  collisionless  electron  heating  can  be 
dominant [27,32].

2.2 Non-local Electron Kinetics (NLEK) Module 

This module solves for the RF electric field, current and 
power  deposition  profiles  in  a  non-uniform  plasma.  In  the 
non-local  regime,  the  current  at  any  point  in  the  plasma 
depends  on  the  electric  field  at  all  other  points.  Maxwell(cid:146)s

The  factor  (cid:147)2(cid:148)  was  used  in  the  first  term  in 
parenthesis on the right hand side of Eq. (17) to model the 
loss  of  electrons  to  the  walls,  i.e.,  for  every  electron 
produced due to an ionization event, one electron is lost to 
the  walls.  Variable  u   in  Eqs.  (21)-(23)  represents  the 
u
kinetic energy of electrons, 
, and should  not 
be confused with the ion fluid velocity introduced later.

2.3 Heavy Species Transport (HST) Module 

The  heavy  species  transport  module  solves  for  the  ion 
density and velocity profiles as well as the metastable species 
density. Since the extremely thin sheaths were not included in 
the  simulation,  the  quasi-neutrality  constraint  was  imposed, 
and the location of the plasma-sheath boundary was taken to 
be the wall. Since the drift-diffusion approximation for ions is 
questionable  at  pressures  below  about  10  mTorr,  a 
momentum equation was solved to compute the Ar+ velocity. 
The  metastable  Ar*  species  density  is  quite  uniform  at 
pressures  below  about  10  mTorr.  Hence,  a  spatially  average 

(0-D) model was used to determine Ar*. Due to symmetry, 
only half the domain (0≤x≤L/2) was considered. 

The  HST  module  uses  the  mass  continuity  equation 
for Ar+ and the ion momentum equation written in terms of 
ion velocity,

2.4 Maxwellian EEDF Calculation 

The  model  described  in  the  previous  sections  can  be 
used  for  the  self-consistent  calculation  of  RF  discharge 
properties  in  the  non-local  regime  including  a  non-

The  simulation  consisted  of  three  modules:  an  electron 
energy  distribution  function  (EEDF)  Module,  a  non-local 
electron  kinetics  (NLEK)  module,  and  a  heavy  species 
transport  (HST)  module  (Fig.  3).  The  NLEK  module 
computed  the  non-local  conductivity  kernel  G(x,x(cid:146))  and 
solved for the RF electric  field and current profiles. The RF 
electric field at the  wall E0  was adjusted to  match the target 
total  power.  The  RF  field  profiles  were  used  in  the  EEDF 
( )Dε ε  
module  to  compute  the  energy  diffusion  coefficient 
f ε . The 
0( )
(Eq. (13)) and solve  for the distribution  function 
latter  was  used  to  compute  the  electron-impact  reaction  rate 
coefficients via Eq. (30) (e.g., ionization and excitation rates), 
)effT   profile.  The 
and  the  effective  electron  temperature  (
effective electron temperature was used in the ion momentum 
equation (Eq. 29), and also in the boundary condition for ion 
velocity  at  the  wall  (Eq.  31).  The  ionization  and  excitation 
rates  were  used  as  source  terms  in  the  continuity  equations 
for ions, and metastables. The HST module provided, among 
other  quantities,  the  ion  (electron)  density  and  electrostatic 
potential φ as a function of position. These were fed back to 
the  NLEK  module  to  calculate  a  new  RF  field  profile.  The 

calculation  was  repeated  until  convergence  to  a  self-
consistent  solution.  When  using  a  Maxwellian  EEDF, 
iterations  were  performed  between  the  NLEK  and  HST 
module only (the EEDF module was not used). In this case, 
the HST module included an electron energy balance (Eq. 
32) to compute the electron temperature profile.

The initial electron density profile was assumed to be 
a  sine  function  peaking  at  the  center.  The  corresponding 
potential  was  computed  assuming  a  uniform  Maxwellian 
temperature of 2.5 V. Convergence was declared when the 
potential  profile  changed  by  less  than  0.1%  (in  the  L2 
norm), which typically took about 30 iterations around the 
modules. At convergence, the ion density profile predicted 
by  the  HST  module  and  the  electron  density  profile 
predicted by the EEDF module differed by less than 0.1% 
(in the L2 norm). The computation time on a 933 MHz Intel 
Pentium 3 Windows NT was ~ 10 hrs for a run with non-
Maxwellian  EEDF,  and  ~  1  hr  for  a  run  with  Maxwellian 
EEDF.

the  electron  collision  frequency  is  comparable  to  the 
applied  field  frequency.  In  each  case,  profiles  calculated 
using  the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF  module  (solid  lines)  are 
compared  with  profiles  (dashed  lines)  obtained  using  the 
Maxwellian  EEDF  approximation  under

predicting  a  higher  ionization  rate.  For  a  pressure  of  1

is lower than that of electrons with energies greater than 1

the 
Maxwellian  case,  the  electron  temperature  is  independent  of 
power  while  for 
the  non-Maxwellian  case,  significant 
differences  are  observed  with  power.  The  large  difference 
between the temperatures at the edge and the center  may be 
explained  by  examining  Fig.  4a  (solid  lines).  The  EEDF 
shows that electrons with total energies less than ~1 V are not 
effectively  heated.  Electrons  with  such  low  energies  are 
essentially  trapped  near  the  discharge  center  (where  the 
heating  field 
the 
is  weak)  as 
effective 
electrostatic  potential  barrier.  Hence, 
temperature  at  the  center  is  low.  In  contrast,  electrons  with 
relatively  high  energies  can  overcome  the  potential  barrier 
and reach the edge where the field is strong, and the effective 
temperature  at  the  periphery  (and  larger  total  energies)  is 
high. Note that even for the highest plasma density in Fig. 4, 
the  electron-electron  mean  free  path  is  about  10  m  for  1  eV 
electrons, much higher than the interelectrode gap. Therefore, 
the  electron-electron  and  collisionless  energy  diffusion 
coefficients  are  comparable  at  very  low  energy,  ~  1  eV,  see 
Fig. 4.  As a result, low energy electrons form a Maxwellian 
distribution  with  very  low  temperature,  ~  1  eV    [34].  Note 
that  the  part  of  the  EEDF  corresponding  to  such  cold 
electrons is difficult to measure experimentally. 

the 

The  effective  temperature  profile  becomes  less  non-
uniform  as  power  is  increased,  because  of  higher  electron 
density resulting in more (cid:147)thermalization(cid:148) of the distribution 
by  e-e  collisions.  The  discrepancy  between  the  Maxwellian 
temperature  and  the  effective  temperature  near  the  edge 
induces a difference in the effective electron mean free path, 
which leads to considerably different field and current density

profiles as discussed below. 

to 

Fig. 6 shows the profiles of the normalized amplitude 
of  the  RF  field.  The  field  profile  is  monotonic  for  low 
power.  However,  for  high  power,  the  behavior  becomes 
progressively  non-monotonic  due 
increasing  non-
locality. Specifically, the skin depth decreases with power, 
and the more energetic electrons can escape from the skin 
layer during a RF cycle, resulting in non-local behavior and 
non-monotonic RF field profiles. The effect of non-locality 
is  more  pronounced  for  the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF, 
especially  for higher powers  for  which the  RF  field at the 
discharge center is more than 50% of the value at the edge. 
This  is  a  direct  consequence  of  the  higher  effective 
temperature  predicted  by  the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF  near 
the  edge  compared  to  the  Maxwellian  case.  Warmer 
electrons can reach further in the discharge core. 

The  corresponding  power  deposition  profiles  are 
shown  in  Fig.  7.  The  peak  of  power  deposition  in  the 
Maxwellian  case  is  seen  to  occur  closer  to  the  boundary, 
when compared to that of the non-Maxwellian case. This is 
because of the higher effective temperature of electrons in 
the  skin  layer  for  the  non-Maxwellian  case,  which  causes 
them to travel a greater distance during an RF cycle. Both 
cases exhibit negative power deposition near the discharge 
center.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  phase  difference 
between the current and the RF field; electrons can pick up 
energy from the field within the skin layer and lose energy 
back  to  the  field  outside  the  skin  layer.  Negative  power 
deposition  has  been  observed  experimentally  for  low-
pressure inductively coupled discharges [35]. 

The  corresponding  positive  ion  density  profiles  are 
shown in Fig. 8. The positive ion density is determined by 
two  factors:  (1)  the  effective  electron  temperature  at  the 
boundary,  which  controls  the  loss  rate  of  ions  to  the  wall 
(Eq.  31)  and  (2)  the  rate  of  ionization  (ground-state  and 
metastable).  The  latter  depends  on  the  tail  of  the  EEDF 
beyond  the  ionization  threshold  of  15.76  V  (ground  state 
ionization  dominates  under 
these  conditions).  The 
ionization  rate  was  found  to  be  marginally  higher  for  the 
non-Maxwellian 
effective 
EEDF.  However, 
temperature at the wall for the non-Maxwellian case (~ 6.5 
V) is larger than the Maxwellian temperature of 4.4 V (Fig. 
5), leading to larger losses for the non-Maxwellian EEDF. 
This results in lower density for the non-Maxwellian case. 
The  differences  in  the  peak  densities  are  32.4,  38.8,  and 
44.4%, respectively, for 50, 100, and 200 W. 

the 

 
4.2  Pressure=10 mTorr 

 

For a pressure of 10 mTorr, the electron collision 
frequency  is  ν =3  x  107  s-1  which  is  comparable  to  the 
discharge frequency of ω = 8.52 x 107 s-1. Fig. 9 shows the 
EEDF as a function of total energy for the non-Maxwellian 
(solid  lines)  and  Maxwellian  (dashed  lines)  cases.  The

ν > Ω ,  where

b

there is no resonant (bounce) heating of low energy electrons. 
Furthermore,  since  the  electron  density  at  10  mTorr  is 
to 
sufficiently  high,  electron-electron  collisions 
thermalize  the  bulk  of  the  distribution.  This  results  in  a  bi-
Maxwellian  EEDF  with  bulk  electrons  having  an  effective 
temperature  of  ~3  V,  and  electrons  at  the  edge  having  a 
temperature of ~3.5 V (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 also suggests that the 
distribution  function  is  more  Maxwellian-like  at  higher 
powers  (higher  electron  density),  leading  to  a  less  non-
uniform  effective  temperature  profile.  This  effect  is  more 
pronounced at higher pressures (compare to Fig. 5), again due 
to  higher  electron  density.  An  important  difference  between 
Maxwellian  and  non-Maxwellian  EEDFs  in  Fig.  9  is  the 
depletion  of  high  energy  electrons  in  the  non-Maxwellian 
case. 

Fig. 11 shows the normalized profile of the amplitude of 
the  RF  field  as  a  function  of  position  for  total  power  of  50, 
100  and  200  W.  Solid  and  dashed  lines  correspond  to  the 
respectively. 
non-Maxwellian  and  Maxwellian  EEDFs, 
Interestingly,  the  Maxwellian  case  predicts  more  (cid:147)non-
locality(cid:148)  at  10  mTorr  compared  to  1  mTorr  (Fig.  6),  where 
the opposite was true. This is due to the considerably higher 
electron density (Fig. 13) predicted by the Maxwellian EEDF, 
leading to smaller skin depth and more non-locality.  

The corresponding power deposition profiles are shown 
in  Fig.  12.  The  profiles  for  the  Maxwellian  and  non-
Maxwellian  cases  are  similar,  with  the  power  deposition 
reaching  a  maximum  within  the  skin  layer,  and  decaying 
towards  the  center  of  the  discharge.  The  peak  in  power 
density  for  the  Maxwellian  case  occurs  ~  0.4  cm  from  the 
wall,  while  the  peak  location  is  seen  to  vary  for  the  non-
Maxwellian  EEDF.  This  is  because  the  temperature  of  the 
Maxwellian  EEDF  does  not  change  with  power,  but  the 
effective temperature of the non-Maxwellian EEDF does vary 
with power (Fig. 10). 

The  corresponding  positive  ion  density  profiles  are 
shown  in  Fig.  13.  Significant  differences  are  observed  with 
the  Maxwellian  EEDF  predicting  higher  densities.  The 
deviation  in  peak  density  for  50,  100,  and  200  W  is  70.5, 
88.2, and 92.8%, respectively. The reason for the discrepancy 
is 
the  Maxwellian  EEDF  predicts  more 
ionization (tail extending to higher energies, Fig. 9), and (b) 
the effective electron temperature at the edge is lower for the 
Maxwellian EEDF (Fig. 10), leading to lower ion losses (Eq. 
31).

4.3 Comparison with Experiments 
Figures 14 and 15 show comparisons between simulated 
and  experimental  EEDFs  for  an  asymmetric  2D  inductively 
coupled Ar discharge [36]. The chamber ID was 19.8 cm and 
the  inter-electrode  spacing  was  10.5  cm.  The  driving 
frequency  of  the  coil  current  was  13.56  MHz.  Similar 
experimental  results  were  obtained  in  Ref.  [37].  Because 
experimental data were taken in a reactor which is at least 2-

D, while the model presented in this work is only 1-D, the 
EEDF module was tested separately, using the fact that the 
EEDF is determined mostly by the total power deposition. 
A  uniform electron density  was assumed (square potential 
well)  corresponding  to  the  peak  density  (at  the  discharge 
center),  obtained  experimentally  [36].  Other  parameters 
were the electron-neutral collision frequency and the RMS 
value  of  the  RF  field  E0  at  the  wall  [36].  An  RF  field 
corresponding to the local approximation (Ohm(cid:146)s law) was 
used  for  this  comparison.  These  values  were  used  to 
compute the energy diffusion coefficient (see Eq. (13)) and 
then obtain the EEDF (Eq. (25)). 

Fig.  14  shows  the  comparison  between  experimental 
(open symbols) and simulated (lines) EEDFs for a pressure 
of  1  mTorr.  The  experimental  profiles  are  clearly  non-
Maxwellian  and  this  fact  is  reflected  in  the  simulated 
profiles. The agreement between theory and experiment is 
very  good  for  200  W  where  the  experimental  behavior  is 
captured for almost the entire energy range. This is not the 
case  for  12  W  and  50  W  where  theory  predicts  a  longer 
high-energy  tail.  However,  the  temperature  of  the  tail 
agrees  well  with  the  experimental  temperature.  Similar 
trends are observed in Fig. 15, which is for 10 mTorr.  

It should be once more noted that the model presented 
in this work is 1-D while the experiments were performed 
in a system  which is at least 2-D. Hence, a self-consistent 
simulation  of  the  experiment  is  not  possible.  For  this 
reason,  comparisons  were  made  using  the  experimentally 
measured  plasma  density.  The  measured  skin  depths  were 
also  used  for  the  RF  field  with  the  local  approximation. 
The  goal  of  the  exercise  was  to  test  the  theoretical  EEDF 
model as a stand-alone module. The discrepancies between 
the 
theory  and  experiment  might  well  be  due 
multidimensional  nature  of  the  experiment,  which  is  not 
captured by the model.

5.0 CONCLUSIONS 

A  self-consistent  1-D  model  was  developed  to  study 
the effect of electron energy distribution function on power 
in  a  planar 
absorption  and  plasma  density  profiles 
inductively  coupled  argon  discharge  in  the  non-local 
regime  (pressures  ≤  10  mTorr).  The  model  consisted  of 
three modules: (1) an electron energy distribution function 

(EEDF) module to compute the non-Maxwellian EEDF, (2) a 
non-local  electron  kinetics  module  to  predict  the  non-local 
electron  conductivity,  RF  current,  electric  field  and  power 
deposition  profiles  in  the  non-uniform  plasma,  and  (3)  a 
heavy  species  transport  module  to  solve  for  the  ion  density 
and  velocity  profiles  as  well  as  the  metastable  density.  The 
self-consistent  simulation  predicted  the  RF  electric  field, 
power  deposition,  electron  energy  distribution  function,  and 
ion density profiles. Results using the non-Maxwellian EEDF 
were  compared  with 
those  predicted  by  assuming  a 
Maxwellian EEDF under otherwise identical conditions.  

important 

that  (cid:147)resonant  heating(cid:148)  can  be 

The  self-consistently  determined  EEDFs  for  the  non-
Maxwellian  and  Maxwellian  cases  were  quite  different  for 
both  1  and  10  mTorr.  At  a  pressure  of  1  mTorr,  the  non-
Maxwellian EEDF showed a (cid:147)resonant heating(cid:148) mechanism, 
where  electrons  with  energies  greater  than  1  V  were  heated 
more  efficiently,  compared  to  the  Maxwellian  case.  This 
suggests 
in 
determining  the  EEDF  at  very  low  pressures.  At  10  mTorr, 
the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF  assumed  a  bi-Maxwellian 
structure,  with  (cid:147)temperatures(cid:148)  of  ~3.5  V  and  ~3  V, 
respectively, for the low energy and high-energy parts of the 
distribution. A depletion of the high-energy tail was observed 
in the non-Maxwellian EEDF due to electron energy losses in 
inelastic collisions. The power deposition profile for the non-
Maxwellian  and  Maxwellian  cases  were  different  for  the 
pressures  and  powers  investigated.  This  was  attributed  to 
different temperatures predicted by the two EEDF models. In 
both cases, negative power deposition was observed near the 
center  of  the  discharge,  due  to  non-local  electron  kinetics. 
The ion (electron) density predicted by the Maxwellian EEDF 
was  up  to  93%  larger  than  that  predicted  by  the  non-
Maxwellian EEDF. This was mainly due to a larger effective 
electron  temperature  at  the  wall  predicted  by  the  non-
Maxwellian  EEDF,  leading  to  higher  ion  losses.  Thus, 
accounting  for  the  non-Maxwellian  EEDF  is  important  for 
modeling ICPs operating at very low pressures.

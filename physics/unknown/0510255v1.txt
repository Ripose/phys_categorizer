Abstract 

The  basic  formal  and  numerical  aspects  of  different  degree  interpolated  moving  least-

squares  (IMLS)  methods  are  studied  using  sixteen  different  combinations  of  coordinate 

system  for  fitting  and  weight  functions.  For  the  application  we  use  six-dimensional 

potential  energy  surface  (PES)  of  hydrogen  peroxide,  for  which  an  analytic  (“exact”) 

potential is available in the literature. We systematically examine the effect of parameters 

in the weight function, the degree of the IMLS fit, and number of ab initio points. From 

these studies we discovered that the IMLS for almost all pairs of coordinate system show 

qualitatively  similar  behavior,  however,  the  accuracy  of  the  fits  is  noticeably  different. 

We also found compact and accurate representations of potentials for presented degrees 

of IMLS.

1.  Introduction 

Potential  energy  surface  (PES)  of  the  molecular  system  plays  a  critical  role  in 

theoretical  studies  of  chemical  reaction  dynamics.  The  enhanced  computer  facilities 

allow for straightforward use of ab initio forces in molecular dynamics simulations. It is 

fairly  routine  now  to  perform  high-quality  ab  initio  calculations  for  hundreds  to 

thousands of geometries. However, the computational expenses increase rapidly with the 

enlargement of size of system, and also the levels of theory used in these calculations are 

often inadequate for the reactions. Although the results obtained by means of high-level 

quantum chemistry calculations  are characterized with high accuracy, the calculation of 

high-level ab initio forces needed for the trajectory integrations is not always feasible. All 

these difficulties, which will be solved in time, prevent the global use of direct dynamics 

calculations,  and  motivate  to  develop  the  alternative  approaches.  Such  efficient 

alternatives are fitting methods.  

Since  the  1970s  a  variety  of  PES  fitting  methods  have  been  developed.[1]  For 

example, least-square fitting methods, spline methods, reproducing Kernel Hilbert space 

interpolation  methods,  Morse-spline  and  rotated  Morse-spline  methods.  These  methods 

can  be  categorized  as  weighted  or  unweighted.  During  the  past  decade  the  local  fitting 

method  introduced  by  Ischtwan  and  Collins,[2]  which  is  based  on  modified  Shepard 

interpolation, has become widely accepted. A serious problem with unmodified Shepard 

method, referred to as the “flat-spot” phenomenon, is that the derivative of the interpolant 

is zero at every data point. This prevents the straightforward use of the Shepard method. 

However, this problem can be avoided by using a Taylor expansion that includes the first 

 

 

2 

and  second  derivatives  at  each  data  points.[3]  An  attractive  feature  of  the  modified 

Shepard approach is its  simplicity. It can be coupled with dynamics  simulations to bias 

the  fit,  but  the  need  for  gradients  and  Hessians  required  in  this  method  are  not  always 

available in higher-level ab initio calculations. 

Recently, we have introduced interpolating moving least-squares methods (IMLS),[4-8] 

for  fitting  PESs.  The  IMLS  is  the  least  used  method  among  the  fitting  methods.  Three 

decades  ago  McLain[9]  studied  two-dimensional  fits  for  some  simple  functions  using 

zero-,  first-,  second-,  third-,  and  fourth-degree  IMLS  methods.  Recently,  Ishida  and 

Schatz[10,11]  presented  a  scheme  in  which  a  second-degree  IMLS  (SD-IMLS)  method  is 

combined with modified Shepard interpolation. The IMLS methods as modified Shepard 

belong to the group of weighted fitting methods and involve polynomials of any desired 

degree.  The  Shepard  method  is  in  fact  a  zero-degree  IMLS  method  (ZD-IMLS).  The 

IMLS  methods  do  not  need  gradients  and  Hessians,  which  makes  them  efficient  for 

fitting  PESs  obtained  by  high-level  ab  initio  calculations.  In  our  studies  we  have  done 

detailed analysis of IMLS methods up to nine degree for one-dimensional applications,[5] 

and applied IMLS to three-[4] and four-atomic systems.[6-8] The character of IMLS allows 

us to employ successfully several different mathematical procedures, the automatic point 

selection,[5,8]  fixed  and  variable  cutoff  radiuses,[7,8]  partial  reduction  of  cross  terms,[8] 

which  makes  IMLS  more  efficient  and  accurate.  Apart  from  mathematical  testing  the 

classical trajectories were carried out on higher degree IMLS surfaces to  study reaction 

rates for the O-O bond breaking in hydrogen peroxide (HOOH).[7]  

The present work is one of the members of series that we started two years ago, and 

reports the detailed studies of IMLS dependence on coordinate system. It was shown for 

 

3 

modified  Shepard  method  that  the  choice  of  coordinate  system  is  important  for  the 

accuracy  of  fit.[2,10-14]  We  also  have  partially  touched  this  matter  in  our  previous 

studies,[6-8] which motivated us to perform more detailed analysis in this direction. This 

paper  illustrates  the  basic  formal  and  numerical  aspects  of  first-,  second-,  and  third- 

degree IMLS methods for four different coordinate systems.   

In order to make the link to the previous works we use the same sets of ab initio data 

points of HOOH calculated from the analytical potential PCPSDE developed by Kuhn et 

al.[15] We selected an analytical PES to avoid the more costly procedure of calculating ab 

initio points. 

An  outline  of  this  paper  is  as  follows:  Section  2  contains  a  brief  review  of  IMLS 

method. The sampling and coordinate systems that are used in the IMLS applications are 

discussed  in  Section  3.  The  results  are  discussed  in  Section  4.  The  summary  and 

conclusions are given in Section 5. 

2.  Method 

 

 

 

 

 

The  basic  aspects  of  the  IMLS  method  are  outlined  in  our  previous  papers[4-8]  and 

earlier  standard  references.[16]  It  will  be  briefly  outlined  here  for  1D  applications.  The 

generalization to many dimensions is straightforward. 

Suppose m linearly independent functions bj(X) (j=1,…,m) are given and defined on 

the whole surface, the fitted surface is then a linear combination of these monomials bj, 

4 

                                       u(X)=

(X)

(X),                                                     (1) 

where 

(X) are the coefficients. The fit of function u(X) to the data values f1,…,fN can 

be evaluated by means of error functional 

                                          E(u) =

(X)[u(X)-f(i)]2                                                     (2) 

It is assumed that m ≤ N and we have introduced wi(X) a weight functions, which depend 

not only on data points X(i) as usual weight functions, they also are functions of X, the 

location  on  the  PES  where  a  fit  is  required.  The  weight  functions  have  relatively  large 

values for X(i) close to X, and relatively small for the more distant X(i). They can take 

                                         

                                                              (3)       

 where n is a small positive integer and ε is a very small positive real value that forces wi 

to  be  finite  at  X  =  X(i).  We  will  discuss  weight  functions  for  different  coordinates  in 

The  coefficients  aj(X)  can  be  obtained  from  the  standard  formulation  of  the 

normal equations for least-squares fitting:

solution a(X) to Eq. (4) provides the coefficients to the u at point X. Since the matrix B, 

known as a Vandermonde matrix, is ill-conditioned,[16] this approach can be unstable for 

higher-degree  IMLS.  In  order to  improve  the  numerical  stability  we  use  either  singular 

value decomposition (SVD) or QR factorization approaches.  

 

 

 

fits. 

3.  Characterization of sampling and coordinate systems 

 

A. Sampling 

 

The analytical PES allow us critically assess the  accuracy of the IMLS fits. First of 

all, we determine two different sets of data points: set 1 is the data points used for fitting, 

and set 2 is a much larger set of points used for the evaluation of global rms error of the 

The  sampling  scheme  plays  an  important  role  in  the  efficiency  of  fitting 

multidimensional  PESs. In  our  previous  study[8]  we  have  tested  four  different  sampling 

methods  for  fitting.  It  was  shown  that  the  grid  method  is  the  most  efficient  method  to 

sample  the  data  points.  In  present  work  we  employ  the  grid  sampling  method.  As  in 

previous paper, we augment 89 symmetry distinct predetermined data points, selected for 

6 

set 1 to cover the low-energy region of the PES, with points selected in a grid built from a 

geometric progression: 

                      

,                                               (5) 

where f > 1, each ni is an integer, r1 is the H1-H2 distance, r2 is H1-O1, r3 is H1-O2, r4 is 

O1-H2, r5 is H2-O2, r6 is O1-O2, and 

                                            

.                                                           (6) 

 

 

 

 

For set 2 we use only the geometric progression to select points but with values of f  

closer  to  unity  which  produces  a  finer  grid.  The  40  192  data  points  used  for  set  2  was 

generated  by  f  =  1.1108,  comparing  to  six  times  larger  set  it  gives  minor  differences 

(0.6%  -  1.5%)  in  rms  errors. The  energies  of  data  points  in  both  sets  are  less  than  100 

kcal mol-1. The both set 1 and set 2 essentially  encompass all the parts of PES that are 

chemically interesting for HOOH→OH+OH dissociation and association reactions. Only 

extraordinary high energies (>100 kcal mol-1) or exceptionally large OH+OH separations

dissociation/association  reactivity  of  the  HOOH  system  can  be  computed  with 

confidence.  

                                  

B. Coordinate systems 

      We  examine  four  coordinate  systems:  1.  interatomic  distance  coordinates  (IAD);  2. 

reciprocal  interatomic  distance  coordinates  (RIAD);  3.  valence  internal  coordinates 

(VINT); 4. reciprocal valence internal coordinates (RVINT). In the next Sections we will 

use  the  following  denotations  for  hybrids,  e.g.  VINT-RIAD,  RVINT-IAD  ect,  the  first 

term of pairs denotes the coordinate system used for fitting and second term denotes the 

coordinate system used for the weight function. 

       It  has  been  shown[2,6-8,10-13]  that  the  use  of  hybrids  of  coordinate  systems  is 

sometimes  more  efficient  than  the  same  coordinate  systems  used  for  both  fitting  and 

weight function coordinates. The interatomic distance and reciprocal interatomic distance 

coordinates  were  used  in  these  studies.  The  denotation  of  interatomic  distances  and 

reciprocal interatomic distances are R = (r1, r2, r3, r4, r5, r6) and X = 1/R, respectively. 

The expression of weight function for interatomic and reciprocal interatomic coordinates 

is given in Eq. (3).  

       The valence internal coordinates are bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles. 

For HOOH molecule the valence internal coordinates are Z = (rOH, rOO, rOH, θ1, θ2, cosτ), 

the reciprocal valence internal coordinates are T = (1/rOH, 1/rOO, 1/rOH, θ1, θ2, cosτ). The 

 

 

8 

expressions  of  weight  functions  for  valence  and  reciprocal  valence  internal  coordinates 

are following: 

              

                                                                                                                                                         

                                                                                                                                           (7)        

where a, c, and d are the coefficients, which link the distances and angles. In order to find 

out the optimal values for these coefficients we have calculated rms error of energies as a 

function of c and d (a = 1 and has a unit rad-2). The Fig. 1 (a,b) illustrates the results. The 

hybrid RVINT-VINT was used for determination of optimal value for c coefficient, panel 

a, the optimal value of coefficient d, was defined by RVINT-RVINT combination, panel 

b. The change of coordinate system for fitting coordinates does not change the region of 

optimal  values  of  coefficients  c  and  d,  so  all  calculations  shown  in  next  Section  have 

been  performed  with  coefficients  c  =  1  and  d  =  10.  The  other  parameters  of  weight 

function used in these calculations are ε = 1×10-20 and n = 5, the number of data points in 

set 1 is 1689, and the degree of IMLS is second (SD-IMLS).

parameters ε and n, the degree, the number of data points N. In our previous studies[5,7,8] 

we  have  examined  these  dependences  for  some  coordinate  systems.  Since  the  present 

work  encompasses  the  broad  spectrum  of  coordinate  systems  the  results  of  previous 

4.  Results 

studies are also included. 

      A. Dependence on ε 

 

 

 

 

 

The  figures  2-5  demonstrate  the  dependence  of  rms  error  of  energy  on  ε  for  first-

degree IMLS (FD-IMLS), SD-IMLS, and third-degree IMLS (TD-IMLS) fits for a fixed 

value of n. The number of data points used in these calculations is 1689. Five conclusions 

can be drawn from these figures. First, the most of the results given in these figures are 

qualitatively  the  same,  i.e.  when  ε  is  too  large the  accuracy  of  all fits  is  degraded,  as  ε 

decreases  the  rms  error  reaches  a  minimum  that  essentially  persists  for  all  further 

decreased  ε.  Second,  the  hybrids  VINT-IAD  and  RVINT-IAD  give  a  qualitatively 

different  behaviour  for  some  degrees  of  IMLS  (figures  4  and  5),  which  automatically 

discards  these  pairs  from  the  list  of  useful  combinations  of  coordinate  systems.  Third, 

with fixed value of ε, increasing the degree of IMLS decreases the rms error. Fourth, all 

pairs  of  coordinate  systems  show  only  necessity  of  ε  to  be  small  enough  for  optimally 

accurate  fits.  The  ranges  for  the  optimal  values  of  ε  are  different  for  different  pairs  of 

10 

coordinate systems. The figures 2-5 show that the smallest ranges have the pairs where 

weight function employs RIAD coordinates, however, the use of small ε (~10-20 or less) 

guarantees  optimal  performance  of  the  weights  for  any  coordinate  system.  Fifth,  the 

range of accuracy of the fits for different coordinate systems is quite noticeable. For FD-

IMLS  the  difference  between  the  rms  errors  of  best  and  worst  fits  is  2.35  (kcal  mol-1), 

which is 26%. For SD- and TD-IMLS these differences are larger: 2.97 (kcal mol-1) and 

2.95 (kcal mol-1), which are in percentage 61% and 68%, respectively. The most accurate 

fit  for  FD-IMLS  is  obtained  by  hybrid  RVINT-RIAD.  For  SD-  and  TD-IMLS  hybrid 

RIAD-VINT  gives  the  best  results.  However,  figures  2-5  show  that  several  other 

combinations of coordinate systems also should be considered as the useful hybrids since 

their fits are quite accurate. 

  

 

 

B. Dependence on n 

The  figures  6-9  illustrate  the  behaviour  of  rms  error  of  energy  for  FD-,  SD-,  TD-

IMLS as a function of n for a fixed value of ε selected at its optimal value. The number of 

data  points  is  the  same  as  in  previous  sub-section  A  studies.  Almost  all  hybrids  of 

coordinate  systems  of  FD-,  SD-,  TD-IMLS  behave  in  qualitatively  similar  ways  with 

optimal  fits  occurring  for  large  enough  values  of  n.  As  in  previous  sub-section,  the 

behaviour of some hybrids of coordinate systems, VINT-IAD and RVINT-IAD for FD- 

and  SD-IMLS  (figures  8,  9),  is  qualitatively  different  from  others.  These  hybrids  are 

considered as an useless combinations and eliminated from the list. The results show that 

 

11 

the  range  of  optimal  values  of  n  for  all  pairs  starts  from  4  and  persists  for  all  further 

larger n. Also, for any given value of n, the fitting error improves with the degree of the 

IMLS fit. The similar to sub-section A, the pairs RVINT-RIAD and RIAD-VINT give the 

smallest  rms  errors  for  FD-IMLS  and  SD-,  TD-IMLS,  respectively.  The  differences 

between the best and worst rms errors for FD-, SD-, TD-IMLS are 2.27, 2.41, 2.65 (kcal 

mol-1), which are in percentages 26%, 56% and 66%, respectively. 

 

 

 

 

C. Dependence on N and on degree 

The results in previous sub-sections A and B indicate that the optimal fits for almost 

all combinations of coordinate systems can be achieved by means of large enough values 

of  n  and  small  enough  values  of  ε.  The  tables  1-3  show  the  rms  fitting  errors  for  eight 

different numbers of data points for FD-, SD-, and TD-IMLS. The data points in both sets 

are  sampled  by  the  scheme  described  above.  For almost  all  combinations  of  coordinate 

system the rms error always decreases as the number of data points increases, exceptions 

are again VINT-IAD and RVINT-IAD hybrids for FD- and SD-IMLS. Also, increasing 

the  degree  of  IMLS  systematically  improves  the  fit  for  each  coordinate  system.  The 

results for SD- and TD-IMLS (tables 2-3) indicate that the choice of coordinate system is 

important for accuracy of the fit, different variations of coordinate system give noticeably 

different  rms  errors.  Some  hybrids  give  better  fits  for  lower  degree  IMLS  than  other 

hybrids of higher degree IMLS. There are several pairs illustrating the most accurate fits 

for  FD-,  SD-  and  TD-IMLS  (RIAD-IAD,  RIAD-RIAD,  RIAD-VINT,  RVINT-RIAD, 

12 

RVINT-VINT).  However,  it  is  hard  to  choose  the  best  one  since  there  is  no  the 

combination  of  coordinate  systems  giving  the  least  values  of  rms  error  for  all  listed 

numbers of data points. The rms errors of TD-IMLS for small numbers of data points are 

considerably  high  than  rms  errors  of  FD-  and  SD-IMLS.  It  is  not  surprising  since  the 

number of ab initio points per dimension goes as N6, and in the case of 189 and 289 data 

points we have 2.4 to 2.6 points per dimension,  which are very small numbers for TD-

IMLS to show the advantage over lower degrees of IMLS.[5-8] We also have investigated 

the power law behaviour for all combinations of  coordinate system given in tables 1-3. 

For FD-IMLS it varies from –0.21 to –0.34, for SD- and TD-IMLS power changes from –

0.52 to –0.74 and –2.77 to –2.97, respectively. As in previous studies, the inverse powers 

increase with the degree of IMLS. However, we  should notice the main contribution to 

the power of TD-IMLS comes from rms errors of first two smallest data points (189 and 

289). The deletion of these terms significantly drops down the power. 

 

 

  

5. Conclusions 

We  have  presented  the  basic  formal  and  numerical  aspects  of  IMLS  methods  of 

different degree in the context of 6D application for sixteen different pairs of coordinate 

system.  We  have  performed  the  detailed  examination  of  effect  of  weight  function 

parameters for all 16  combinations. From this  systematic behavior, we have discovered 

the regions of parameter space for the weight functions that allow compact and accurate 

representations  of  potentials  for  FD-,  SD-  and  TD-IMLS  fits.  In  spite  of  significant 

 

13 

difference in accuracy of the fits we have found that the behaviour of IMLS methods for 

the majority number of pairs is qualitatively similar. Only two hybrids for FD- and SD-

IMLS  behaved  differently.  The  dependence  of  rms  error  on  number  of  data  points  N 

illustrated that rms error converges with N in inverse power law fashion with powers that 

increase  with  the  degree  of  IMLS  fit.  All  calculations  performed  in  this  paper  are 

addressed  to  the  behaviour  of  rms  errors  of  energy  values.  In  order  to  carry  out  the 

trajectory  calculations  the  information  of  gradients  is  needed.  We  have  performed  the 

detailed  investigation  of  behaviour  of  gradients  for  a  few  different  pairs  of  coordinate 

systems in our previous studies,[4,5,7,8] and found the qualitative similarities with rms error 

of  energy.  The  scale  of  rms  error  of  gradients  is  much  larger,  because  the  range  of 

gradients  is  much  larger  than  the  range  of  energy  values.  Naturally,  the  following 

question can be raised: how accurate  should be a fit of energy values which allows the 

accurate  chemical  dynamics.  We  partially  studied  this  question  in  our  previous  work[7] 

for  HOOH  using  valence  internal  and  interatomic  coordinates,  and  found  inconsistency 

between  rms  errors  of  different  coordinate  systems  and  accurate  rate  constant  for  O-O 

bond fission. In other words, the different coordinate systems require different accuracy 

of the rms fits to achieve accurate dynamics properties. Thus, the complete answer on this 

question can be given after systematic dynamics simulations for different systems using 

different pairs of coordinate systems. One of these studies is in progress for five-atomic 

system.

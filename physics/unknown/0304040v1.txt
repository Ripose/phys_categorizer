Abstract 

Research  has  shown  that  both  high  school  and  university  students'  reasoning 

patterns regarding direct current resistive electric circuits often differ from the currently 

accepted  explanations.    At  present,  there  are  no  standard  diagnostic  examinations  in 

electric  circuits.    Two  versions  of  a  diagnostic  instrument  called  Determining  and 

Interpreting  Resistive  Electric  circuits  Concepts  Tests  (DIRECT)  were  developed,  each 

consisting  of  29  questions.  The  information  provided  by  the  exam  provides  classroom 

instructors  a  means  with which to  evaluate the progress and conceptual difficulties of 

their  students  and  their  instructional  methods.    It  can  be  used  to  evaluate  curricular 

packages  and/or  other  supplemental  materials  for  their  effectiveness  in  overcoming 

students’  conceptual  difficulties.    The  analyses  indicate  that  students,  especially 

females,  tend  to  hold  multiple  misconceptions,  even  after  instruction.  During 

interviews, the idea that the battery is a constant source of current was used most often 

in answering the questions. Students tended to focus on current in solving the problems 

and  to  confuse  terms,  often  assigning  the  properties  of  current  to  voltage  and/or 

resistance.  Results  indicated  that  students  do  not  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the 

underlying  mechanisms  of  electric  circuit  phenomena.    On  the  other  hand,  students 

were  able  to  translate  easily  from  a  “realistic”  representation  of  a  circuit  to  the 

corresponding schematic diagram.   

Introduction 

 

 

In recent years, physics educators at all levels have begun to look more closely at 

what their students understand about physics concepts.  Students’ patterns of response 

to questions about circuit phenomena are often in conflict with those currently accepted 

by the physics community.  The term "misconception" will be used to refer to students' 

pattern  of  response.    This  pattern  could  be  part  of  a  coherent  naïve  theory  of  circuit 

phenomena  or  a  more  fragmented  and  primitive  response  produced  on  the  spot  as  a 

result of the questions posed.  

Widespread  use  of  test  instruments  such  as  the  Force  Concept  Inventory1  (FCI) 

and  the  Test  of  Understanding  Graphs  in  Kinematics2  (TUG-K)  have  brought  a  new 

way  of  evaluating  students’  conceptual  understanding.    However,  more  instruments 

need  to  be  developed  in  a  variety  of  areas  to  allow  instructors to better  evaluate their 

students’ understanding of physics concepts and to evaluate new teaching endeavours 

for  their  future  feasibility.  The  Determining  and  Interpreting  Resistive  Electric  circuits 

Concepts  Test  (DIRECT)  was  developed  to  evaluate  students’  understanding  of  a 

variety  of  direct  current  (DC)  resistive  electric  circuits  concepts.    DIRECT  has  been 

designed  for  use  with  high  school  and  college/university  students.    Common 

misconceptions were incorporated into the distracters of the test items. 

This article will discuss the development of DIRECT versions 1.0 and 1.1 and will 

examine  their  feasibility  for  use  in  assessing  students’  conceptual  understanding  and 

potential  use  in  evaluating  curricula.    The  article  will  answer  the  following  research 

questions:    1)  Can  a  multiple-choice  test  be  developed  that  is  reliable,  valid  and 

 

 

 

uncovers  students’  misconceptions?    2)  Are  there  significant  differences  between 

various  groups  of  students  taking  DIRECT? 

  Specifically,  are  there  noticeable 

differences between course level (high school vs. university), gender, and instructional 

methods?  3) What misconceptions can the test detect? 

The  body  of  knowledge  regarding  students’  understanding  of  DC  resistive 

electric circuits is quite extensive.3  Students’ typical response patterns indicate that they 

make  two  assumptions  regarding  DC  resistive  electrical  circuits:    (a)  current  is 

consumed4  and  (b)  the  battery  is  a  source  of  constant  current.5    In  addition,  students 

interchangeably  use  terms  associated  with  circuits,  often  assigning  the  properties  of 

current to either voltage, resistance, energy, or power.6   

Physicists  use  schematic  diagrams  to  represent  circuit  elements  and  examine 

their behavior.  Students’ recognition of what these diagrams represent is an important 

aspect  of  their  understanding  of  circuits.    Research7  reveals  that  students  view  these 

diagrams  as  a  system  of  pipes  within  which  flows  a  fluid  they  refer  to  as  electricity.  

Students  have  difficulty  identifying  series  and  parallel  connections  in  diagrams.8    We 

refer  to  this  later  as  a  topological  error.    Students  do  not  understand  and  do  not 

correctly apply the concept of a complete circuit.9  Gott10 reports that more than 90% of 

students age 15 recognized the need for a complete circuit.  However, he finds a small 

but insignificant group of students who would include a short circuit (such as a shorted 

battery) as an acceptable complete circuit. 

In  analyzing  circuits,  students  view  it  in  a  piece-meal  fashion  as  opposed  to 

globally.    There  is  some  evidence11  to  indicate  that  students  change  their  reasoning 

 

 

patterns  to  suit  the  question  at  hand.    Thus,  they  do  not  appear  to  use  a  single, 

consistent model to analyze circuit phenomena.  Instead, students use one of three ways 

of  reasoning:  sequential,  local,  or  superposition.    Sequential  reasoning  results  in  a 

“before  and  after”  examination  of  the  circuit.    Students  using  sequential  reasoning 

believe that (a) current travels around the circuit and is influenced by each element as it 

is encountered and (b) a change made at a particular point does not affect the current 

until it reaches that point.12  Thus, for the circuit shown in Figure 1, closing the switch 

will not affect bulb A since the current has already passed that point.  Von Rhoneck and 

Grob  differentiate  local  from  sequential  reasoning  in  the  following  way:  “local 

reasoning  means  that  the  current  divides  into  two  equal  parts  at  every  junction 

regardless  of  what  is  happening  elsewhere.”13      Given  the  circuit  shown  in  Figure  2, 

students would say that the current in branch 1 was equal to that in branch 2.  Students 

using  superposition  reasoning  would  conclude  that  if  one  battery  makes  a  bulb  shine 

with a certain brightness, then two batteries would make the bulb shine twice as bright, 

regardless of the configuration.14

When confronted with a qualitative problem, students show a fear of reasoning 

qualitatively and resort to technical or quantitative approaches.15  This is said to be due 

to a lack of experience solving qualitative problems.16  Additionally, students have been 

shown to have difficulty mastering reasoning with ratios.17 

Tests  in  the  area  of  dc  resistive  electric  circuits  do  exist18,  however,  they  have 

mostly been developed as either a research tool  or curriculum assessment  instrument, 

not as a general assessment tool.  Thus, there are problems with many of these tests that 

prevent them from being used for this purpose.  Those that have been developed as a 

research  tool  often  have  restricted  content,  looking  at  a  single  concept  such  as 

resistance.19    Those  that  did  cover  more  topics  generally  had  a  single  item  for  each 

objective,20  which  did  not  allow  for  comparisons  between  questions  nor  provided 

additional  statistical  evidence  of  comprehension.    (Was  it  the  question  or  the  concept 

that  students  didn’t  understand?)    Statistical  evidence  pertaining  to  the  reliability  and 

validity of the tests has not been well documented.  Many of the assessment tests were 

developed  mainly  to  evaluate  and  to  revise  the  curriculum  materials  with  which  they 

 

 

were  associated.    Although  some  of  these  tests  did  reveal  and  quantify  students’ 

conceptual understanding,21 they were often not intended to be used in a wider format.  

Many  of  these  tests  have  been  administered  to  small  groups  of  students  with  similar 

abilities or only to the groups under investigation.  Small sample sizes can increase the 

sampling error.  Thus, a test that could be used as both a research tool in assessing new 

curriculum  materials  or  teaching  strategies  as  well  as  evaluating  students’  conceptual 

views that has sound statistical evidence of its reliability and validity was needed in the 

area of dc resistive circuits. 

Development of DIRECT versions 1.0 and 1.1 

As  a  first  step  in  developing  DIRECT,  a  set  of  instructional  objectives  was 

constructed after an extensive examination of high school and university textbooks and 

laboratory  manuals  plus  informal  discussions  with  instructors  using  those  materials.  

The  objectives  were  presented  to  a  panel  of  independent  experts  to  ensure  that  no 

fundamental concepts were overlooked. The final objectives are shown in Table I. 

One  typical  comment  that  the  panel  made  regarding  the  objectives  was  the 

omission of the use of meters in terms of their placement in circuits and their use as a 

measurement  device  to  determine  the  behavior  of  the  circuit.    Although  an  important 

part  of  laboratory  work,  meters  serve  as  an  application  of  electric  circuits  concepts  as 

opposed  to  a  distinct  concept  of  their  own.    Research  has  shown  that  students  fail  to 

treat meters as circuit elements and to recognise the implications for their construction 

and  external  connections.22    Psillos,  Koumaras,  &  Valassiades23  found  that  a  group  of 

14-15 year old Greek students believed that an ammeter would consume current so that 

 

 

it functioned in the same manner as a light bulb.  The students did not understand that 

a good ammeter simply allows current to flow through it and has a negligible effect on 

the  circuit.    Thus,  if  such  devices  were  included  on  the  exam,  it  would  be  difficult  to 

determine  if  students  were  having  difficulties  with  circuit  concepts  like  current  or  if 

they were having difficulties with the use and function of the meters. 

 

The test was developed first in an open-ended format so that distracters for the 

multiple-choice version could be constructed.  Efforts were made to write several items 

per  objective.    For  example,  three  questions  using  a  different  mode  of  representation 

were  written  for  objective  5.    The  three  modes  were  verbal  to  schematic,  “realistic”  to 

schematic, and schematic to “realistic.” Some test items were adapted from the Physics 

by  Inquiry24  materials  and  College  Physics25  by  Serway  and  Faughn.    Members  of  the 

independent  panel  of  experts  suggested  some items,  however,  most of  the items were 

original. 

In  general,  the  questions  were  not  aligned  with  any  particular  instructional 

approach  so  that  the  results  would  be  the  most  applicable  to  the  largest  possible 

audience.  Questions written for objective 9, microscopic aspects of the circuits, were the 

only  exception  and  were  closely  aligned  with  the  approach  proposed  by  Chabay  and 

Sherwood  in  their  text,  Electric  and  Magnetic  Interactions.26    They  were  included  to 

evaluate  how  well  students  understand  the  microscopic  aspects  of  circuits  as  this 

connection has only recently begun to be explored in some of the newer textbooks.  As 

Cohen, Eylon and Ganiel27 have noted, this lack of a causal relation may be the cause of 

some of the problems students have with electric circuits.

Large  sample  sizes  were  desired  so  as  to  reduce  the  magnitude  of  sampling 

error.28    Thus,  test  sites  were  solicited  via  a  message  placed  on  a  listserv  for  physics 

education  researchers  and  educators  (PHYS-LRNR)  requesting  test  sites  for  the 

multiple-choice  versions  of  the  instrument  and  via  contacts  made  during  the  1993 

Physics  Courseware  Evaluation  Project’s  (PCEP)  Summer  Teachers’  Institute  held  at 

North Carolina State University. 

The multiple-choice version 1.0 of DIRECT (printed at the end of this article) was 

administered  to  1135  students  from  high  schools  (N=  454)  and  universities  (N=  681) 

across the United States.  The 29-item test took approximately half an hour to complete.  

The statistical analysis of the test is presented in Table II along with information about 

the statistics and their ideal values.    Figure 3 shows the distribution of scores for the 

total sample, which is positively skewed indicating a difficult test.  Table III shows the 

percentage (as a decimal) of students selecting each answer choice for each question as 

well as the point bi-serial correlation, discrimination, and difficulty of each question.  

DIRECT  version  1.1  was  developed  after  an  examination  of  the  results  as  well  as 

individual  follow-up  interviews  that  indicated  that  DIRECT  version  1.0  needed  to  be 

revised  to  improve  the  test’s  reliability  as  well  as  to  clarify  test  questions  that  were 

confusing  to  students.    There  were  two  main  revisions.    The  first  was  to  increase  the 

number  of  answer  choices  to  5  for  all  questions.    In  doing  so  some  questions  became 

more quantitative in nature, asking by how much the brightness changed as opposed to 

asking  if  it  increased/decreased  or  stayed  the  same.    The  second  was  to  redraw  the 

 

 

circuit  diagrams  containing  a  light  bulb  in  a  socket  using  only  the  battery,  bulb  and 

wires as the interviews indicated that students were confused about this representation.

DIRECT version 1.1 was administered to 692 students from high schools (N= 251) 

and  universities  (N=  441)  in  Canada  (one  high  school  and  one  university  test  site), 

Germany  (one  high  school  test  site)  and  the  United  States.    DIRECT  version  1.1 

consisted of 29 items, each with 5 answer choices, and took approximately half an hour 

to complete.  The statistical analysis of the test is presented in Table II.    Figure 3 shows

General findings 

In this section, we will discuss the discrimination ability and the performance on 

the overall objectives for each version of the test.   

 

 
 

 
 

 

 

 

 
Discrimination 
 
 

Discrimination is a measure of the ability of a question to differentiate between 

students  who  scored  well  overall  on  the  test  from  those  who  did  not.    Examining  the 

data  from  DIRECT  version  1.0  revealed  that  question  26  was  the  most  discriminating.  

To  answer  this  question  correctly,  students  could  not  reason  sequentially,  believe  that 

the battery was a constant source of current, or think that current was consumed.  

 

For  the  overall  sample  (university  and  high  school  combined)  and  for  the 

university  sample,  questions  20  and  28  were  the  least  discriminating;  even  students 

who scored well overall on the test had difficulties with these questions.  Question 20 

deals  with  what  causes  a  current  in  a  bulb  filament.      Students  tended  to  confuse  the 

cause and effect choosing the option that the current caused the field.  Question 28 deals 

with  the  concept  of  the  battery  as  a  source  of  constant  potential  difference.    Students 

tended to reason that since the current in a part of the circuit is zero, the voltage is also 

zero.    For  the  high  school  sample,  question  18  was  the  least  discriminating.    This 

question  shows  four  circuits  containing  a  battery,  some  connecting  wires,  and  a  light 

bulb in a socket. It seems that students were able to identify complete circuits but were 

unable to eliminate those that contained shorts. 

 

Examining the discrimination indices for version 1.1 revealed that for the overall 

sample  and  for  the  university  sample,  question  14  was  the  most  discriminating. 

Students  who  answered  correctly  had  to  understand  how  to  calculate  the  equivalent 

resistance for resistors in a series/parallel combination and to compare that equivalent 

 

 

resistance to that of two resistors in series. Question 27 was the most discriminating for 

the high school sample, exploring students’ understanding of objectives 1-3 in Table I.  

For  all  samples  (overall,  university  and  high  school),  question  11  proved  the  least 

discriminating, with nearly half the students choosing the answer where charges push 

each other through the wires like marbles in a tube. 

 Performance on the objectives 

 

Table  I  shows  how  well  students  performed  on  each  of  the  instructional 

objectives  for  both  versions  1.0  and  1.1.  An  examination  of  the  distracters  of  both 

versions  showed  that  on  average  17%  of  the  students  could  not  identify  a  short  in  a 

circuit  and/or  determine  what  effect  the  short  had  on  the  circuit,  10%  did  not  know 

where  the  contacts  are  on  a  light  bulb,  6%  had  trouble  identifying  a  complete  circuit, 

and 28% exhibited current/voltage confusion. 

 

On  both  versions  of  DIRECT,  students  were  able  to  translate  from  a  “realistic” 

representation  of  a  circuit  to  the  schematic  but  had  more  difficulty  in  identifying  the 

correct schematic from  a written description  of the circuit or in identifying the correct 

“realistic”  representation  of  a  circuit  from  the  given  schematic.    In  general,  students 

could  identify  a  complete  circuit.    The  difficulty  arose  when  students  were  asked  to 

determine  whether  the  circuit  worked  or  not,  often  including  circuits  that  contained 

shorts. 

Can  a  multiple-choice  test  be  developed  that  is  reliable  and  valid  and  in  addition 
uncover students’ misconceptions?  
  

 

 

For  a  test  to  be  good,  it  must  be  both  reliable  and  valid.    Reliability  is  the 

consistency  of  the  test  in  measuring  what  it  does  measure.    The  Kuder-Richardson 

formula 20 (KR-20) was used to evaluate the reliability of both versions of DIRECT.  The 

KR-20 should be at or above 0.70 for group measurements. Although this was the case 

for both versions (see Table II) of the test, the somewhat low values could be the result 

of the  low  discrimination and high difficulty indices.  The low average discrimination 

values  may  be  an 

indication 

that 

the 

test 

is 

indeed  uncovering  students’ 

misconceptions. 

The other important and vital characteristic of any test is its validity–the ability to 

measure what it is intended to measure. Validity is not a quality that can be established 

in  a  single  measurement,  but  is  accumulated  via  several  measurements.    The  content 

validity (Does the test cover the appropriate material?) and the construct validity (Does 

the test measure electric circuits concepts like current, voltage, etc?)  for DIRECT were 

examined. 

Content  validity  was  established  by  presenting  the  test  and  objectives  to  an 

independent  panel  of  experts  to  insure  that the domain was  adequately covered.  The 

panel  took  the  test  and  matched  test  items  with  objectives.    This  yielded  a  percentage 

agreement  for  the  answer  key  as  well  as  for  the  objectives.    Both  open-ended  (during 

the early development stages) and multiple-choice questions were directed to the panel. 

In cases where agreement on the objectives was low, questions were rewritten to clarify 

what  was  being  asked.  Although  each  question  was  written  to  address  a  particular 

objective,  the  test  involves  items  that  require  the  test  taker  to  utilize  additional 

 

 

information not specifically asked by the question.  Because of this, some questions by 

necessity addressed more than one objective.  

 

The construct validity of DIRECT was evaluated through a factor analysis, which 

will only be touched upon briefly here, and interviews.  A factor analysis analyses the 

interrelationships  within  the  data  and  can  be  used  to  select  groups  of  items  that  all 

appear  to  measure  the  same  idea  or  factor.    The  factor  analysis  performed  for  both 

versions  used  the  Little  Jiffy  method  which  revealed  8  factors  associated  with  version 

1.0 and 11 factors associated with version 1.1.29  The interviews served two purposes: 1) 

to  determine  if  the  questions  were  being  understood  in  ways  that  were  not  intended 

and  to  better  understand  students’  choices  and  2)  to  provide  evidence  of  the  test’s 

construct validity through the replication of results from previous studies.  

 

Individual follow-up interviews using a subset of 10 questions with 17 university 

and 11 high school students were conducted as part of the construct validity check. This 

provided  information  on  whether  the  questions  were  being  understood  in  ways 

contrary to what was intended. Interviews lasted approximately 30 to 40 minutes each.  

Each  session  was  audio  taped  and  later  transcribed.    Any  notes  that  students  made 

during the interview were collected.  The interview was semi-structured and made use 

of a think-aloud procedure, which required students to verbalize aloud their thoughts 

as they emerged.  The interview was divided into three parts: identification of symbols 

used  on  the  test,  definition  of  terms  used  on  the  test,  and  answering  the  test  items, 

providing  reasoning  behind  the  choice  and  their  confidence  on  their  answer.  The 

student’s answers to the multiple-choice exam were available during the interview.  If 

 

 

students changed their answers from the multiple-choice test, they were asked to recall 

what their reasoning was when they answered the test originally.  To ensure a uniform 

coding of the interview transcripts, an inter-rater reliability was established with 15% of 

the  sample  at  each  level  (high  school  and  university)  with  a  percentage  agreement  of 

88%. 

 

The interviews showed  

•  nearly  all  of  the  students  understood  the  symbols  used  on  the  exam  with  the 

exception of the light bulb in a socket 

• 

two-thirds knew that a light bulb had two connections 

•  one third believed that there was only one connection which was located at the 

bottom of the bulb. 

The  interviews  were  able  to  replicate  results  of  previous  studies.  For  example, 

some  students  who  chose  option  E  on  question  3  reasoned  via  battery  superposition 

replicating  the  results  of  Sebastià.11    Here  is  an  example  from  a  student  taking  a 

traditional, calculus-based course: 

I think I would put E because the batteries are providing the energy so since they 
both  have  two  two  [sic]  batteries.    I  didn’t  think  that  it  would  matter  whether 
they  were  in  parallel  or  series  because  they’re  gonna  add  a  certain  amount  of 
voltage  and  when  the  parallel  batteries  link  up  it’s  gonna  be  equivalent  to 
whatever voltage is added when they are in series and then the light bulbs since 
they are just two in series, that’s the same for all three pictures.

In reviewing the results obtained from the follow-up interviewwith version 1.0, 

there initially appeared to be no pattern to the students’ reasoning on the interviewed 

questions.    However,  examining  which  misconception  was  used  most  often  on  each 

question and comparing them with the global objectives (see Table V) for each question 

did yield a pattern.  Table V shows the four main divisions or global objectives: physical 

aspects  of  the  circuit,  energy,  current,  and  potential  difference  (voltage)  and  the 

misconceptions  that  were  cued  for  the  interview  questions  posed.    For  the  global 

objective of voltage, the dominant misconceptions for these questions were battery as a 

constant current source, term confusion I/V, local reasoning, and battery superposition.  

These misconceptions related to students’ understanding of the properties of the battery 

and what it supplies to the circuit.  Similarly, for the global objective of physical aspects 

of  the  circuit,  typical  misconceptions  were  topology,  contacts,  and  term  confusion  I/R.  

These  misconceptions  related  to  the  physical  features  of  the  circuit.    The  topological 

errors students made seemed to indicate that they looked at the surface features of the 

circuit.    The  contact  error  indicated  that  students  were  missing  some  knowledge  of 

 

where the contacts are located on a light bulb.  Term confusion I/R errors indicated that 

students  did  not  understand  that  a  resistor  (including  light  bulbs)  has  an  inherent 

resistance  based  on  its  shape  and  the  material  from  which  it  is  made.    One  could 

categorize  errors  associated  with  the  physical  aspects  of  the  circuits  as  students  not 

having  the  declarative  knowledge  needed  to  understand  the  physical  nature  of  the 

circuit  diagram  and  its  associated  elements.    Thus,  although  different  questions  cued 

the  use  of  different  misconceptions,  the  students  did  tend  to  use  misconceptions 

associated with the global objective of the question. 

 

To  summarize,  there  is  evidence  that  both  versions  of  DIRECT  are  reliable  and 

valid.  Both versions appear to  be able  to illicit students’ conceptual understanding of 

DC resistive electric circuits concepts. 

Are there significant differences between level (High School vs. University), gender, 
and instructional methods? 
 
 

 
To answer this question, a series of t-tests and ANOVA were used to see if there 

were  significant  differences  between  various  groups  of  students  who  had  taken 

DIRECT versions 1.0 and 1.1.  Groups were considered significantly different if the level 

of significance or p-value was at or below .05 which gives a 95% level of confidence that 

there is truly a difference.  All t-tests assumed a one-tail test of significance so that the 

superiority of one group over the other could be determined.  Students’ raw scores were 

used in these calculations, so that a score of 29 is equivalent to 100%. 

Level (High School vs. University) 

 

 

For version 1.0, there were significant differences in the means for the university 

(M    =  15)  and  high  school  groups  (M    =  12),  t  (1008)  =  11,  p    <  3.8  x  10-28,  with 

university  students  outperforming  high  school  students.    There  were  no  significant 

differences  between  calculus-based  (M    =  16)  and  algebra-based  (M    =  15)  university 

students,  t  (191)  =  -1.6,  p    <  .06.    No  significant  differences  were  found  between  the 

Advanced Placement or Honors high school students (M  = 12) and those high school 

students taking a regular physics class (M  = 13), t (342) = -.89, p  < .19.  Similar results 

were  obtained  for  version  1.1.    Analysis  of  interview  results  found  no  significant 

differences  in  the  number  of  misconceptions  used  by  university  (M    =  8)  and  high 

school  students  (M    =  9),  t  (23)  =  -.73,  p    <  .24.    However,  university  students  were 

significantly  (p  <  0.006)  more  confident  in  their  interview answers  than were  the high 

school students.   

Gender 

For  version  1.0,  significant  differences  were  found  in  the  means  for  males  and 

females  with  males  outperforming  females  at  all  levels,  overall,  university,  and  high 

school  (see  Table  VI).    Interview  results  indicated  significant  differences  between  the 

number of misconceptions used by males (M  = 6) and females (M  = 11), t(25) = 3.9, p  < 

.0003, with females using more than males.  A similar finding was found for university 

males (M  = 6) and females (M  = 11), t (11) = 3.6, p  < .002.  However, there were no 

significant differences found between high school males (M  = 6) and females (M  = 10), 

t (4) = 1.4, p  < .12.  Males were more confident in their interview responses than were 

females (p  < .0006).

Instructional method 

To  evaluate  the  feasibility  of  using  DIRECT  in  the  evaluation  of  curricular 

materials  and  for  assessing  new  teaching  methods,  several  subgroups  who  took 

DIRECT versions 1.0 and 1.1 were chosen for further examination.  Part of the DIRECT 

version 1.0 university sample contained a small group of calculus-based students who 

used  a  new  textbook  by  Chabay  and  Sherwood,  which  discussed  the  microscopic 

aspects of circuit phenomena.  Comparisons were made to see if this group of students 

showed  any  differences  from  other  university  students  using  more  traditional 

textbooks.  There were significant differences found between students using the Chabay 

and Sherwood text (M  = 18) and students using more traditional textbooks (M  = 15), t 

(76) = -3.8, p  < .0001, as well as the university group (M  = 15) as a whole (algebra and 

calculus-based combined), t (44) = -4.2, p  < 6.1 x 10-5.  Those students using the Chabay 

and Sherwood textbook outperformed both groups. 

There was a small group of students who used the Physics by Inquiry materials, 

which  uses  an  inquiry  approach  to  instruction  with  a  great  number  of  hands-on 

activities  who  took  DIRECT  version  1.1.    An  analysis  of  variance  (ANOVA)  was 

 

 

 

 

 

performed which allows one to compare the means of more than two groups.  Results 

showed  that  there  were  significant  differences  found  between  the  students  using  the 

Physics  by  Inquiry  materials  (M    =15),  calculus-based  students  (M    =13),  and  algebra-

based  students  (M    =12),  F  (2,  438)  =  4.13,  p    <  .017.    Those  students  using  Physics  by 

Inquiry outperformed both groups. 

This  examination  of  various  subgroups  that  used  various  new  curricular 

materials  showed  that  there  were  statistically  significant  differences  between  their 

scores and other students who were taking more traditional courses.  These results are 

only preliminary and were performed to evaluate if DIRECT could be used in this way.  

More rigorously designed studies would need to be developed to further evaluate the 

apparent differences between these subgroups and other students.  DIRECT appears to 

be  able  to  assess  differences  between  groups  of  students  using  differing  instructional 

methods and materials. 

What misconceptions can the test detect? 

This  section  will  discuss  what  difficulties  and  misconceptions  DIRECT  can 

detect.  The interview results showed a variety of difficulties students experienced with 

a subset of questions from DIRECT as shown in Table V. 

A comparison of students’ definitions of terms used on DIRECT and the student 

misconceptions  indicates  that  the main source of the difficulty is with term confusion, 

generally associated with current.  Students assign the properties of energy to current, 

and  then  assign  these  properties  to  voltage  and  resistance.    Specifically,  both  voltage 

and resistance can only occur in the presence of a current. 

 

 

 

Results  indicate  that  students  do  not  have  a  clear  understanding  of  the 

underlying  mechanisms  of  electric  circuits.    This  is  most  likely  the  result  of  a  weak 

connection  between  electrostatics  and  electrokinetics  phenomena  since  this  connection 

is only now beginning to be addressed in some of the newer textbooks. 

Students were able to translate easily from a “realistic” representation of a circuit 

to  the  corresponding  schematic  diagram.    Students  had  difficulty  making  the  reverse 

translation.  However, this result may be more indicative of their difficulty identifying 

shorts  within  circuits  or  of  deficiencies  in  their  knowledge  regarding  the  contacts  for

Figure 4: Question 7 from DIRECT version 1.1. 

 

 

One  aspect  of  DIRECT  that  sets  it  apart  from  other  tests  that  have  been 

developed is the use of batteries connected in series or parallel.  This inclusion allows 

one  to  investigate  how  students  interpret  voltage  and  current  in  circuits  containing 

these  elements.    Results  from  version  1.0  indicated  that  students  had  difficulty 

predicting  the  resulting  voltage  and  current.    Interviews  indicated  that  some  of  the 

students were using superposition reasoning while others were using a combination of 

battery as a constant current source and local reasoning.  Hand-written notes made by 

the students during the interviews indicated that some students may have been trying 

to  apply  rules  for  equivalent  resistors  or  capacitors  to  the  battery  arrangements.  

Version  1.1  explored  further  distinctions  between  two  batteries  in  series  and  two 

batteries in parallel through questions 3 (kept in its original form) and question 7 (see 

Figure 4).  Results from these questions indicated the following: 

1)  Students believing that two batteries in parallel provide more energy 

(27%) also believe that they provide more voltage (21%).  (Pearson r  = 
.37) 

2)  Students believing that two batteries in series provide more energy 

(46%) also believe that they provide more voltage (51%).  (Pearson r  = 
.45) 

3)  Students believing that two batteries in series and two batteries in 

parallel provide the same energy (17%) also believe that they provide 
same voltage (22%).  (Pearson r  = .41) 

 

 
 

 
 

 

These  questions  containing  multiple  batteries  were 

items  questioned  by  the 

independent panel of experts.  They were concerned that this might diminish the results 

of  the  test  because  multiple  batteries  are  not  typically  taught.    However,  the  ideas 

necessary to analyze these circuits are presented in most courses.  The ideas are that (a) 

 

 

the potential difference in two parallel branches remains the same while the currents in 

the  parallel  branches  add  to  equal  the  total  current  available  and  (b)  the  potential 

difference  across  each  element  in  series  adds  to  equal  the  total  input  from  the  battery 

while current remains the same.  These ideas are used in a number of the problems and 

were acknowledged by the panel of experts as important to include on the exam.  Thus, 

if students truly understand these concepts, they should be able to apply them to novel 

situations. 

Conclusions and Implications 

 

Both versions of DIRECT appear to be both reliable and valid.  Results indicate 

that either version could be useful in evaluating curriculum or instructional methods as 

well  as  providing  insight  into  students’  conceptual  understanding  of  dc  circuit 

phenomena. 

Interview  results  indicated  that  students  use  the  idea  that  the  battery  is  a 

constant  current  source  most  often  in  solving  the  interview  problems.    Students  were 

found  to  use  different  misconceptions  depending  on  the  problem  presented.    Thus, 

different  questions  cued  different  misconceptions.    Although  students  tended  to  use 

different  misconceptions  for  each  question  presented,  they  did  tend  to  use 

misconceptions related to the global objective of the question. 

There are differences associated with gender in terms of performance, number of 

misconceptions used, and confidence and with course level with regard to performance 

and  confidence.    Generally,  males  outperformed  females  and  had  more  confidence  in 

their  responses  than  did  females.    Females  tended  to  use  more  misconceptions.  

 

 

 

Performance  differences  were  found  on  both  versions  of  DIRECT  with  university 

students  outperforming  high  school  students.    University  students  also  had  more 

confidence in their answer selections. 

 

In revising DIRECT version 1.0, the number of answer choices was increased to 

five  for  all  questions.    In  so  doing,  some  questions  became  less  qualitative  and  more 

quantitative.  Instead of asking does the brightness increase, decrease, or stay the same, 

the questions asked by how much the brightness changed (1/4, 1/2, 2, 4, same).  This 

quantification  of  some  items  was  the  main  difference  between  version  1.0  and  1.1.  

These items accounted for the difference in scores between the two versions.  Changes 

to  the  other  items  resulted  in  only  minor  fluctuations.    Some  of  the  questions  on 

DIRECT version 1.1 required students to analyze simultaneous changes in the variables, 

like  voltage  and  resistance  or  current  and  voltage.    Other  questions  required  that 

students  be  proficient  in  their  use  of  ratios.30    Results  indicated  that  students  had 

difficulty  with  these  analyses  at  times.    The  follow-up  interviews  indicated  students’ 

preference for and reliance on formulas.  

Version  1.0  is  more  qualitative  and  seems  to  elicit  the  misconceptions  more 

directly  while  version  1.1  is  more  quantitative  and  seems  to  elicit  the  students’ 

mathematical  abilities  to  some  extent.    If  one  is  more  interested  in  the  conceptual 

understanding  of  circuits,  version  1.0  and  newer  versions  patterned  after  it  would  be 

the better alternative.  However, if the students’ mathematical abilities were of interest, 

then version 1.1 would be the choice. 

 

 

In  closing,  we  want  to  stress  that  DIRECT  is  not  the  end-all-be-all  of  tests.    It 

simply provides another data point for instructors and researchers to use to evaluate the 

progress  of  students’  understanding.    No  one  instrument  or  study  can  provide  the 

definitive  answer.    Data  regarding  students’  understanding  should  be  considered  like 

evidence of validity--requiring several measurements through different means to arrive 

at the final answer. 

Acknowledgement 

 

The  authors  would  like  to  acknowledge  all  the  students  and  instructors  who 

were involved in field testing DIRECT.   Without their cooperation, this project would 

not have been possible.  We would also like to thank the members of the independent 

panel of experts for their helpful and insightful feedback.

You will have approximately one hour to complete the test.  If you finish early, check your work before 
handing in both the answer sheet and the test booklet. 
 
Additional comments about the test 
 
All light bulbs, resistors, and batteries should be considered identical unless you are told otherwise.  The 
battery is to be assumed ideal, that is to say, the internal resistance of the battery is negligible.  In 
addition, assume the wires have negligible resistance.  Below is a key to the symbols used on this test.  
Study them carefully before you begin the test.

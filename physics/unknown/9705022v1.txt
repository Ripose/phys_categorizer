It is well-known that Lie groups and Lie algebras play a central role in the exact
solvability of the Schr¨odinger equation for many of the basic time-independent potentials
of quantum mechanics.
Indeed, every exactly solvable Hamiltonian can be realized as
a Casimir operator of a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of diﬀerential operators, which is
thought of as an algebra of dynamical symmetries for the problem. The energy levels
of the Hamiltonian are then determined algebraically from the knowledge of the ﬁnite-
dimensional irreducible representations of the Lie algebra. The range of applicability of
the Lie algebraic methods has recently been extended beyond the realm of exactly solvable
systems to a class of potentials referred to in the literature as quasi-exactly solvable. These
potentials are characterized by the property that the Schr¨odinger operator preserves a
ﬁnite-dimensional subspace of the underlying Hilbert space, so that at least part of the
energy spectrum can be determined algebraically, i.e. by diagonalizing a ﬁnite-dimensional
matrix (see for example [Tu], [Ush], [GKO]). The ﬁnite-dimensional invariant space is
realized as an irreducible representation module for a ﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra of
ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators and the Hamiltonian is expressed as a polynomial in the
generators of this Lie algebra. A quasi-exactly solvable Hamiltonian is thus not necessarily
a Casimir operator for the underlying Lie algebra, which has now to be thought of as a
hidden symmetry algebra.

It is natural to ask to what extent the algebraic approaches that have been summa-
rized above can be extended to physically relevant families of time-dependent potentials.
In an interesting recent paper, Zhang and Li [ZL] have shown that certain classes of time-
dependent 1-dimensional potentials with SU (1, 1) dynamical symmetry can be solved ex-
actly by means of unitary transformations. Our purpose in this paper is to show that a
similar procedure can be developed to construct physically interesting examples of quasi-
exactly solvable time-dependent potentials. In contrast with [ZL], it will be essential that
we work with sequences of non-unitary gauge transformations.

We consider the Schr¨odinger equation for a time-dependent potential V (x, t),

i∂tψ = Hψ ,

H = −

+ V (x, t).

We ﬁrst observe that under a gauge transformation given by

ψ(x, t) = S(x, t,

) ¯ψ(x, t),

where S(x, t, ∂
dinger equation (1) is mapped onto a related evolution equation of the form

∂x ) is an invertible formal diﬀerential operator, the time-dependent Schr¨o-

where

¯H = S−1HS − iS−1∂tS.
Following an ingenious idea of [ZL], we shall study time-dependent potentials for which
the Hamiltonian given in eq. (1) is equivalent under a suitable gauge transformation to a
diﬀerential operator of the form

that if ¯φ(x) is an eigenfunction of ¯H0 with eigenvalue λ, then

¯φ(x),

is a solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (1). It should be noted that in
general the gauge operator S will not be unitary, so that ¯ψ(x, t) given by equation (2) is
not necessarily square-integrable in x for all t ≥ 0. The only essential requirement is of
course that the solutions ψ(x, t) of the original physical time-dependent Hamiltonian be
square-integrable. Let us also remark that if ¯φ1(x), . . . , ¯φl(x) are eigenfunctions of ¯H0 with
eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λl, then we obtain an l-parameter family of solutions of (1) as a linear
superposition,

where the parameters c1, . . . , cl are constants to be determined by the initial conditions.
In particular, if ¯H0 admits a countable family of eigenfunctions { ¯φj(x), 0 ≤ j < ∞} such
that the corresponding solutions of (1) form a complete set in L2 for each t ≥ 0, then we
can obtain the general solution of (1) as an inﬁnite sum of this type.

The potentials for which we shall ﬁnd explicit solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation (1)
are time-dependent generalizations of the well-known family of quasi-exactly solvable sextic
anharmonic oscillator potentials ([Tu], [Ush]),

W (x) = ν2x6 + 2µνx4 + (µ2 − (4n + 3)ν)x2,

ν > 0, µ ∈ R, n ∈ N,

(8)

for which the ﬁrst n + 1 even eigenfunctions are of the form

where Pk is a polynomial of degree ≤ n in x2.

The parametrized family of time-dependent anharmonic oscillator potentials for which

we shall partially solve the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation is given by

V (x, t) = u(t)4x6 +2βu(t)3x4 +

(10)
where x > 0, t ≥ 0, where n is a non-negative integer and k ≥ 0, β are real constants, and
where u(t) is an arbitrary function of t ≥ 0 which is positive. If k is a positive integer, the
last term in the potential V (x, t) may be viewed as a centrifugal term in the radial equation
for a spherically symmetric potential, with x playing the role of the radial coordinate. The
domain of deﬁnition of the potential (10) may be extended to the real line if k = 0, 1.

We remark that the diﬀerential operators J −, J 0 and J + form a Lie subalgebra of the Lie
algebra of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators on the half-line x > 0, which is isomorphic to
sl2. It admits the vector space N = {x2j, 0 ≤ j ≤ n} of even polynomials of degree less
or equal to 2n in x as an irreducible ﬁnite-dimensional module. We shall also need the
following time-dependent version of the operators (12):

is a solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation (1) for the sextic potential (10).
This solution lies in L2(x > 0) for all t ≥ 0.

Remark. Note that the diﬀerential operator H0 preserves the irreducible sl2-module N
since it is a polynomial of degree 2 in the generators J −, J 0 and J +. One therefore obtains
polynomial eigenfunctions φ(x) of H0 by diagonalizing the linear endomorphism of N

determined by H0. While the polynomial φ(x) is not square-integrable, the wave function
ψ(x, t) given by (16) will be square-integrable on the positive real axis for all t ≥ 0.

Proof. The ﬁrst step in the proof is to perform the (non-unitary) gauge transformation
given by ψ(x, t) = eσ(x,t)ψ(1)(x, t), where σ(x, t) is deﬁned in (11). The transformed wave
function must thus be a solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation

where H (1) is the time-dependent Hamiltonian deﬁned by

i∂tψ(1) = H (1)ψ(1),

H (1) = e−σ(x,t)Heσ(x,t) − i

(x, t).

It is straightforward to verify that the operator H (1) can be written as

H (1) = − 4 ˜J − ˜J 0 + 4u(t)2 ˜J + + 4βu(t) ˜J 0 − 2(h(t) + 2k − 1) ˜J −

The next step in our proof is to carry out the once again non-unitary gauge transformation
given by

log u(t) ˜J 0 + v(t)
ψ(1)(x, t) = exp
(cid:0)

ψ(2)(x, t),
(cid:1)

with v(t) deﬁned by (11), which gives rise to a time-dependent Schr¨odinger equation for
ψ(2)(x, t),

i∂tψ(2) = H (2)ψ(2),

where H (2) is given by

H (2) = − 4u(t) ˜J − ˜J 0 + 4u(t) ˜J + +

ψ(3)(x, t),
(cid:17)

which transforms (21) into

i∂tψ(3) = 4u(t)H0ψ(3),

with H0 given by (15). The claim now follows by applying formula (6) and by observing
that ψ(x, t) deﬁned by Eqs. (16) and (11) lies in L2(x > 0) since u(t) is positive for all
t ≥ 0 and k is non-negative. Q.E.D.

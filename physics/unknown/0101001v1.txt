Abstract 

sat and Dt

sol respectively, and effective molar ratios, Re

Effective surfactant:phospholipid ratios (i.e. molar ratios in the mixed aggregates, vesicles or micelles) have been determined 
by static light-scattering  for the interaction of egg-yolk lecithin (EYL) multilamellar vesicles (MLV) with Triton X-100 (TX-
100), sodium deoxycholate (DOCNa) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTMB). The suspension of MLV-EYL was 
mixed with appropriate volumes of surfactant solution and was left overnight to reaches thermodynamic equilibrium. Rectan-
gular optic diffusion data were used to compute the solubilization parameters: total surfactant concentrations, at saturation 
sat value ob-
and solubilization Dt
tained graphically for interaction of vesicles with TX-100 resulted that in vesicle bilayers a surfactant molecule is surrounded 
sol value suggests that in mixed micelles ten lipid molecules with about fifteen 
with seven phospholipid molecules and the Re
sat and Re
surfactant molecules coexist. The values of Re
spectively. In case of vesicles solubilization with CTMB, Re
power at thermodynamic equilibrium for the three surfactants is in the sequence: CTMB<TX-100<DOCNa.

Surfactants  are  widely  used  as  molecular 
tools  in  membrane  biochemistry  and  liposome-
mediated drug delivery. Consequently, the interac-
tion between lipid bilayers and surfactants has been 
the  object  of  considerable  attention  [  Helenius, 
1975; Lichtenberg , 1983, 1993, 1996; Cabantchik, 
1985; Lasch, 1993, 1995; Fazakas, 1999]. Lichten-
berg  and  co-workers  [Schurtenberg,  1985;Almog, 
1990;  Lichtenberg,  1995]  have  established  the 
guidelines  for  improved  quantitative  studies  on 
membrane-surfactant  interaction  by  defining  the 
so-called “effective surfactant / lipid ratio", Re. Re is 
defined  as  the  surfactant  /  lipid  molar  ratio  in  the 
mixed aggregates, vesicles or micelles.

The surfactant-induced transition from vesicles to 
mixed  micelles,  originally  described  by  a  three-
staged model [Helenius, 1975; Lichtenberg, 1983; 
Schubert,  1986]  has  to  be  extended  into  a  four-
stage model. The sequence of events in the latter 
are as follows [Lasch,1995]. In stage I the surfac-
tant distributes between water and the lipid phase 
resulting  in  mixed  bilayer  vesicles.  In  stage  II 
mixed bilayer vesicles coexist with mixed bilayer 
sheets  [Ollivon,  1988;  Walter,  1991].  When  a 
critical value of Re is reached (“saturation” of the 
bilayer),  mixed  bilayer  transform  progressively 
into  lipid-rich  mixed  micelles (stage III) until all 
bilayers have disappeared in stage IV. In stage IV 
micelles grow gradually richer in surfactant with a 
concomitant decrease in particle size. 
The  initial  distribution  of  surfactant  may  involve 
only  the  outer  monolayer  of  the  bilayer  [Ueno, 
1984].  In  several  cases  the  membrane  /  water  par-
tition coefficient describing the partitioning of small 
amounts of  a surfactant appears to be a decreasing 
function of surfactant concentration [Schubert, 1986; 
Hobai, 1999]. Over a large range of sub-lytic surfac-
tant  concentrations,  the  partition  of  surfactant  into 
membranes obeys partition coefficient:  
 
K = Db / Dw (L + Db) 
 
where Db and Dw are concentrations of surfactant 
contained  in  mixed  vesicles  and  aqueous  media, 
respectively, and L is lipid concentration. Know-
ing the value of K, the total surfactant concentra-

tion,  Dt  ,  needed  for  a  system  with  phospholipid 
concentration L to have an effective ratio Re [Al-
mog, 1990] is given by expression: 
 
Dt = Re {L + 1 / [ K ( Re + 1 ) ] }  
 

(2) 

In stage I,  Re <<  1 and equation (2) becomes: 

Dt = Re [L + (1 /  K) ]  

 

 

(3) 

 

 

The equations (2) and (3) mean that Dt , required 
for  obtaining  any  effective  ratio  Re,  has  a  linear 
dependence on L. Re is given by the slope of the 
straight line defined by equation (2), which should 
intercept with the x-axis at –1 / [ K ( Re + 1 ) ]. 
 
Solubilization  can  also  be  simply  follo-
wed by static light-scattering at 90o (rectangular 
optic  diffusion).  Light-scattering  evolution  du-
ring  the  solubilization  depends  on  vesicle  type 
[Partearroyo,  1992].  For  small  or  large  unila-
mellar vesicles (SUV or LUV) within the vesicu-
lar range surfactant-induced growth result in in-
creased  light-scattering.  This  increase  of  light 
scattering  not  appear  in  case  of  multilamellar 
vesicles  (MLV).  For  SUV,  LUV  and  MLV 
within the micellar range, increasing Dt (thus Re) 
results  in  a  decrease  in  micellar  size  and  a 
consequent  decrease  of  light-scattering.  Within 
the  coexistence  range  increasing  Re  results  in 
solubilization of a increasingly larger fraction of 
vesicles,  thus in a consequent decrease of light-
scattering. The surfactant concentration required

for  the  onset  of  solubilization  (Dt

sol) as functions of L graphically

Apparatus, materials and method 
Egg  -yolk  lecithine  was  purchased  from 
 
Sigma  Chemical  Co.  type  X-E  (cat.no.  P5394/ 
1996) purified by us by neutral alumina column 
chromatography,  verified  by  thin  layer  chroma-
tography  (silicagel).  The  mobile  phase  was  a 
mixture  CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O  (65:30:4,vol).  The 
identification  of  the  phospholipid    was  made 
with iodine and shows a single spot. Sodium de-

Chemical Co. and cetyltrimethylammonium bro-
mide (CTMB) from Fluka AG. Tris(hydroxyme-
thyl)aminomethane-HCl (Tris-Cl) was purchased 
from  Austranal.  All  chemicals  and  organic  sol-

(DOCNa)  was  purchased 

vents  were  of  analytical  and  of  spectroscopic 
grades, respectively. 

By  using  a  spectrophotometer  Spekol 
with FR optical diffusion system and photocells 
and  voltage  source  type  HQE  40  and  UV  lamp 
type  OSRAM,  was  determined  the  rectangular 
optic  diffusion  at  λ=437  nm  of  MLV-egg-yolk 
lecithin  suspension  in  the  course  of  titration  at 
22.5°C with TX-100 20mM (Table 1), with DO-
CNa (Table 2) and with CTMB 20mM (Table 3). 
The sample was 1.4ml containing 0.5milimols le-
cithin  and  the  titration  rate  was  0.08micromols 
surfactant/sec. At equilibrium condition the vesi-
cle-surfactant  mixtures  were  left  overnight  at 
room temperature.  
 
Liposome dispersion preparation 
 
Appropriate  amount  of  EYL  in  chloro-
form:methanol (9:1,vol) solution was evaporated, 
in a glass test tube, under a nitrogen stream until 
it  reached  the  consistence  of  a lipid film on the 
wall  tube  settled  down.  The  film  was  purged 
with the gas for 30 minutes in order to eliminate 
the alcohol traces. The film hydration and bilayer 
suspension  were  made  with  buffer  Tris-Cl 
0.05M,  pH=7.2  at  0.6mg/ml  (lipid/solution)  by 
vortexing 10 s.  
 
Results and Discussion 
The titration of MLV-EYL suspension with sur-
factants  solutions  was  made  in  the  rectangular 
optic diffusion device described above.

At  thermodynamic  equilibrium  condi-
tions were prepared the mixtures MLV-EYL-sur-
factant  corresponding  to  the  concentrations  se-
 
lected from the data of  Figures 1, 2 and 3.  
We  worked  with  four  series,  consisting 
of 4-5 quots each, one of 1.4ml MLV-EYL sus-
pension. The first series EYL had 0.25mM con-
centration, the second 0.50mM, the third 1.0mM 
and  the  fourth  1.43mM.  In  the  samples  of  each 
series there were added surfactants so that the to-
tal  concentrations  (Dt  )selected  in  the  previous 
experiment  should  be  obtained.  After  surfactant 
addition,  each  sample  was  vortexed  and  left  at 
rest  in  order  to  take  the  equilibrium.  After  16 
hours  the  optical  measurements  at  λ=437nm 
were  made  in  order  to  obtain  Dif% values, pre-
sented in Tables 4 - 7; 9 - 12 and 14 - 16.

[Müller,  1990].  The  values  of  Re
MLV  saturate  with  DOCNa  when  in  the  mem-
brane one surfactant molecule for 14 phospholi-
pid molecules each is present. The solubilization 
is  finished  when  a  surfactant  molecule  corre-
sponds approximately with a phospholipid mole-
cule,  this  being  the  numeric  ratio  between  the 
molecules  of  the  two  species  present  in  the  mi-

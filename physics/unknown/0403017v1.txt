Abstract 
A  theoretical  estimate  of  the  explicit  time  dependence  of  a  drainage  water  of  shallow 
lakes  is  presented  as  an  important  contribution  for  understanding  the  lake  dynamics. 
This  information  can  be  obtained  from  a  sum  of  functions,  largely  used  in  fitting  of 
experimental  data.  These  functions  were  chosen  because  their  centre  and  weight  yield  a 
good  description  of  the  water  basin  behaviour.  The  coefficients  of  these  functions  are 
here  extracted  using  results  of  measured  and  /  or  calculated  data  for  the  state  variables 
describing  the  shallow  West  Lake,  Hangzou.  This  procedure  can  also  be  applied  to  other 
shallow  lakes,  generating  geological  information  about  their  drainage  basin,  which  is 
one  of  the  most  important  parameters  to  describe  their  micrometeorological  behaviour. 
One  concludes  this  work  emphasizing  the  relevance  of  the  explicit  time  dependence  of 
the drainage variables and the requirement of measured data to validate this approach.

1. Introduction 
  

Different  approaches  for  experiments  and  modelling  have  been  proposed  to 
study  the  dynamics  of  lakes  in  specific  environments.  The  main  idea  of  the  present 
modelling  is  a  more  detailed  description  of  lakes,  which  takes  into  account  the  influence 
of  their  environment  and  its  corresponding  micrometeorological  behaviour.  For  better 
understanding,  one  firstly  introduces  a  summary  of  experimental  /  theoretical  modelling 
efforts describing details of lakes, in several regions of the world.  

One  starts  with  the  work  about  the  restoration  of  the  Lake  Eymir,  in  Turkey 
(Beklioglu  et  al.,  2003)  because  some  aspects  discussed  are  interesting  for  future  studies 
about  lakes  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  State,  Brazil.  In  effect,  these  authors  show  that  the  nutrient 
loading  is  a  serious  threat  to  water  quality.  This  successful  restoration  was  executed 
reducing  the  areal  loading  of  total  phosphorus  and  dissolved  inorganic  nitrogen.  In  spite 
of  this  effort,  the  poor  water  clarity  and  mainly  low-submerged  plant  coverage  persisted. 
They  also  found  that  some  kinds  of  fish  perpetuate  the  poor  water  condition.  However,  a 
the  chlorophyll-a  concentrations, 
decrease 
reduced  the  fish  stock  and  led  to  a  better  water  quality.  The  existence  of  fishes  is  not 
considered  in  the  present  work,  neither  for  the  lakes  of  the  Rio  de  Janeiro  State 
(Southeast of Brazil).

Another  subject  of  interest  here  is  the  study  of  the  sensibility  to  acidic  deposition 
in  lakes  of  Adirondack  Mountain  region  of  New  York  State  (Civerolo  et  al.,  2003).  The 
ambient  air  and  the  lake  water  quality  were  analysed  over  a  period  of  ten  years,  in  order 
to  find  the  role  of  seasonality  and  time  variation,  in  estimating  temporal  trends  in  the 
experimental data.

Within  this  general  approach,  one  will  consider  some  examples,  which  apply 

different techniques to study the lake environment behaviour.  

Different  experimental  techniques  have  been  used  to  study  the  role  of  fish 
contamination  on  lakes  and  marine  waters  by  chemical  products  or  natural  toxins. 
Liquid  chromatography  with  mass  spectrometric  detection  was  developed  by  Dahlman 
toxins  extracted  from 
et  al.  (2003) 
phytoplankton,  which  can  lead  on  shellfish  poisoning.  Page  and  Murphy  (2003)  also 
used  a  geographic  information  system  (GIS)  approach  to  create  a  database  to  establish 
the  mercury  (Hg)  levels  in  many  fishes  from  remote  lakes  in  Canada,  where  the  Hg 
quantity exceeds the recommended level for human consumption.

This  summary  gives  a  panoramic  view  concerning  some  shallow  lake  studies 
that  have  been  appeared  in  ecological  literature.  Another  point  of  view  is  taken  in  a 
paper  by  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  who  describe  the  ecosystem  of  West  Lake, 
Hangzhou,  using  an  algal  dynamic  model  that  includes  several  state  variables,  which  are 
not present in the aforementioned works. 

Based  on  the  last  paper,  the  present  work  uses  a  more  general  equations  for  the 
water  column,  including  explicitly  the  time  dependence  of  the  drainage  basin  function 
the 
Q(t), 

concerning  micrometeorological 

effects.  This

importance  of  the  role  of  environment  in  the  lake  dynamics  and  allows  obtaining  the 
simulated results found by Hongping and Jianyi (2002). 
 
One  presents  two  different  steps:  the  first  one  is  mostly  theoretical  description  of 
lake  modelling  (section  2),  and  the  second  concerns  the  interpretation  of  experimental 
data  as  measured  for  the  lake  phyto-zooplankton  community,  observed  on  an  annual 
time  scale  (section  3).  As  it  will  be  made  more  clear  later  on,  the  calculated  data  by  the 
authors  mentioned  above,  for  the  lake  community,  as  a  function  of  time,  are  the  starting 
point to extract information on the strength and time dependence of the drainage water.  
 
2. The model 
 

lake 

the  description  of  a 

The  dynamical  state  equations  for 

in  a  given 
geographical  environment  involve  several  parameters.  The  most  frequently  used  are  the 
rate  equations  which  describe  quantitatively  the  time  dependence  of  the  process  of  birth, 
growth  and  decomposition  of  the  lake  constituents,  together  with  forcing  functions  like, 
for  example,  the  time  dependent  sunlight  incidence.  Many  of  these  rate  constants  can  be 
measured  using  physico-chemical  techniques,  and  the  values,  which  illustrate  this  study, 
are  those  assumed  for  the  Chinese  West  Lake  by  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  at  their 
Table  2.    Examples  suggesting  adequate  approaches  to  hydrobiology  as  applied  to  lakes, 
considered  here,  are  given  by  Ahlgren  et  al.  (1988)  and  Krivtsov  et  al.  (1999). 
Obviously, 
rate 
processes  should  be  adapted  to  the  local  conditions  and  again  extracted  from  experiment 
(Carmouze,  1984;  Suzuki,  1997).  In  particular,  shallow  lakes  connected  to  the  ocean  do 
exist  in  the  region  of  the  North  of  Rio  de  Janeiro  State.  For  application  to  these 
particular  lakes,  the  dynamic  equations  adopted  in  the  present  work  should  be  extended 
to  include  specific  effects  of  the  connection  with  the  sea.  These  cases  may  be 
considered in future work.

The  structure  of  the  physico-chemical  aspects  of  the  model  equations  is  currently 
assumed  independent  of  the  geographic  coordinates  of  a  given  lake.  However,  for  very 
specific  situations,  e.g.,  when  it  exists  a  connection  with  the  sea,  the  mathematical 
structure  of  the  model  must  be  modified.  Thus,  in  some  situations  exhibited  in  Chinese 
West  Lake,  it  is  necessary  to  introduce  explicit  time  dependence  in  some  parameters 
associated  with 
time 
dependence  of  the  drainage  water  is  extracted  using  the  coefficients  of  a  Lorentzian 
expansion, as it will be seen below. 
One  adopts  here 

the 
modelling  of  lakes.  The  state  variables  are  the  biomasses  of  four  species  of  algae, 
Cyanophyta,  Chlorophyta,  Criptophyta  and  Bacillariophyta,  BA1(t),  BA2(t),  BA3(t)  and 
BA4(t),  respectively,  with  their  respective  content  of  phosphorus  PA1(t),  PA2(t),  PA3(t) 
and  PA4(t);  biomass  of  the  zooplankton,  BZ(t),  and  its  content  of  phosphorus,  PZ(t); 
phosphorus 
finally 
orthophosphate,  PS(t),    in  the  lake  water  column.  In  the  present  model,  as  it  was 
mentioned  before,  the  existence  of  fishes  is  entirely  disregarded.  This  assumption  may 
also  be  applied  to  lakes  of  the  Southeast  of  Brazil,  but  not  when  studying  Brazilian  lakes 
in the North of the Country, where fishery is quite relevant.

The  central  point  in  this  work  concerns  the  distribution  in  time  of  the  drainage 
water  which  is  considered  here  as  the  main  micrometeorological  parameter.  Drainage 
water  depends  on  time,  via  a  distribution  function  Q(t)  and  this  quantity  is  described  by 

 

3 

a  sum  of  Lorentzians  functions,  contrary  to  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  who  calculate 
the  quantity  of  drawing  water  Q,  according  to  the  average  quantity  every  month,  which, 
in  fact,  means  that  Q  is  as  a  time  independent  parameter  in  their  description  of  the 
Chinese  Lake.  The  motivation  to  fit  the  Q(t)  functions  with  a  sum  of  Lorentzians  was 
inspired  by  the  usual  approach  adopted  in  techniques  of  experimental  physics,  like 
Electron  Paramagnetic  Resonance  (EPR)  and  Mössbauer  effect.  Experimental  results 
are  very  sensitive  to  the  neighbourhood  of  the  probe.  This  fact  is  expressed  by  a 
combination  of  given  functions,  like  the  Lorentzians,  which  are  defined  by  their  centres 
describing,  in  the  present  case,  the  micrometeorological  time  of  rain  precipitation,  and 
their  widths,  which  describe  the  time  interval  of  precipitation  and  the  soil  diffusion 
process time.  

The  theoretical  results  obtained  by  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  were  retrieved  in 
order  to  extract  the  time  dependence  of  the  water  drainage.  It  should  be  stressed  that  for 
other  available  data  corresponding  to  lakes,  in  Brazil  or  else,  this  proposal  can  be 
applied  to  extract  also  drainage  water  results.  From  now  on,  the  dynamics  defined 
below  will  be  considered  fixed  and  well  defined;  thus,  only  parameters  and  forcing 
functions may be changed to describe different lakes and regions. 
 
The  state  equations,  from  which  the  information  about  the  drainage  water  is 
obtained,  have  the  following  general  form,  where  the  time  dependence  has  been 
previously defined:

where  i  =  1,2,3,4  for  the  four  algae  and  V  is  the  volume  lake.  The  main  difference  in 
respect  to  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  concerns  the  time  dependent  drainage  water  as 
.  These  distribution  functions  are  strictly  time  dependent  and  this 
described  by 
intends to describe the contribution of the diverse micrometeorological effects.

It  should  be  noted  that  the  time  dependent  drainage  water  contributions  to  the 
lake  dynamics  are  expected  to  be  different  for  each  one  of  the  lake  state  variables  and 
represented  as  Q(t)  /  V.  This  difference  is  associated  with  the  several  substances 
drained, which interfere in the time dependence of the state variables.

to  the  phosphorus  in  the  algae.  These  non-linear  functions  have  the  general  form

are  the  state  variables  obtained  from  experiment  as  a  function  of  time  t.  The  parameters 
 lp  are  identical  to  those  of  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  but  a  simulation  changing  them 
can  be  made,  since  the  time  dependence  of  the  state  variable  for  this  new  situation  is 
known  and  thus,  using  the  proposed  procedure,  the  new  drainage  results  can  be 
obtained.  The  detailed  formulation  of  the  functions
  and 
( )tB3
  are  presented  in  Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002),  with  the  parameters  defined  in  their 
Table  2,  which  one  expects  to  be  adequate  to  the  present  study.  Given  the  simulated 
values  for  time  in  the  interval  from  t  =  0  and  t  =360  days,  for  these  functions,  and 
performing  numerical  differentiation  of 
the  state 
variables,  one  can  extract  the  corresponding  drainage  water  Q(t)´s  that  will  be  fitted  by 
eight Lorentzians. The numerical results of such a procedure is shown in the figures.

Another  type  of  dynamical  equation  concerns  the  amount  of  phosphorus  in  the 
four  species  of  algae  and  the  zooplankton.  Their  equations  of  motion  are  written  in 
general terms:

where,  again,  different  Qi(t)  are  used  since  different  substances  are  introduced  by  the 
geological drainage distribution. 

Since  one  has  no  data  concerning  the  internal  phosphorus,  the  values  for  PAi(t) 
and  PZ(t)  are  assumed  proportional 
the  algae  and  zooplankton  biomasses 
to 
respectively.  This  is  based  on  so-called  Redfield  molecule  (Redfield  et  al.,  1963),  which 
intends to represent the average content of this element in these biomasses. 
 

For the case of phosphorus in the sediment, one has the following equation:

It  is  important  to  note  that  contrary  to  the  remaining  equations  for  the  lake  state 
variables,  the  drainage  water  does  not  appear  explicitly  in  Eq.  (7).  This  fact  seems  to  be 
reasonable  since  drainage,  only  indirectly  affects  the  sediment  of  the  lake  via  the  water 
column dynamics, and this is expected to have a  distinct time scale. 

 

 

3. Numerical results and conclusions  
 

To  illustrate  the  results  of  the  model  calculation  for  the  drainage  water,  which  is 
time  dependent  as  suggested  by  micrometeorology,  contrary  to  Hongping  and  Jianyi 
(2002),  one  decided  to  fit  its  time  dependence  through  a  sum  of  Lorentzians.  As 
indicated  in  Fig.  1  of  this  reference,  the  water  drainage  basin  has  a  rather  complex 
including  several  distinct  water  distributions.  One  emphasizes 
geometrical 
that  this  fact  was  the  motivation  to  adopt  this  procedure,  which  is  based  on  the  physical 
experiment  fitting  of  results  in  complex  lattices  in  solids,  studied  by  EPR  or  Mössbauer 

topology,

techniques.  Such  procedure  describes 
the 
contributions  of  a  superposition  of  several  Lorentzians.  Their  centres  and  widths 
represent  adequately  the  relative  relevance  of  the  involved  water  paths  of  Fig.  1  de 
Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002).  A  possible  test  of  this  approach  is  to  compare  with  data  to 
be  obtained  in  Brazilian  lakes  like  those  of  Campos  dos  Goytacazes  region  of  the  north 
of  Rio  de  Janeiro  State.  Eventual  description  including  underground  water  dynamics 
may also be a subject of a further work.

The  numerical  procedure  goes  as  follows:  the  data  presented  in  the  figures  of 
Hongping  and  Jianyi  (2002)  for  BAi(t),  i  =1,2,3,4,  BZ(t),  PS(t)  and  PD(t),  are  taken 
together  with 
their  Table  2.  Given  these  data,  one 
in 
numerically  differentiates  the  curves  adopting  the  values  for  the  quantities  LPS  and  LPD 
given  by  these  authors.  These  parameters  are  other  forms  of  phosphorus,  which  are 
extracted  from  outside  the  lake.  Thus,  it  is  possible  to  extract  the  curves  of

The  advantage  of  the  Lorentzian  fit  is  to  show  at  what  time  and  for  which  time 
intervals  the  geological  water  dynamics  for  the  drainage  occurs.  The  negative  terms  of 
the  expansion  are  interpreted  as  an  important  indication  of  absorption  of  these  drainage 
elements by the lake.

time  dependence  has  been  disregarded  in  some  existent  approaches  in  the  literature.

Abstract 

A  theoretical  model  of  vapor−liquid  phase  transition  in  a  system  of  charged 
hard cores of different diameters is suggested (with the parameters of the transition 
obtained in a number of studies using the Monte Carlo method). The model is based 
on  the  assumption  that,  in  the  neighborhood  of  the  critical  point,  the  system  of 
charged cores is a mixture of multipolarly interacting neutral complexes. 
 

INTRODUCTION 

+σ

Recent  publications  [1−4]  describe  the  use  of  the  numerical  Monte  Carlo 
method and modern techniques of parallel computation to investigate the parameters 
of vapor−liquid phase transition in systems representing a mixture of positively and 
negatively charged hard cores. Mixtures of cores of different diameters were treated 
  and  σ ,  respectively.  The  calculations  were  performed  for  both  charge-
with 
symmetric 
 and charge-asymmetric (2:1 and 3:1) [3] model electrolytes. 
Yan  and  Pablo  [4]  further  examined  the  effect  of  the  asphericity  of  charges  on  the 
parameters  of  phase  transition.  It  was  observed  that  the  dependences  of  the  critical 
  contradict  the  traditional  Debye 
parameters  on  the  asymmetry  factor 
mean-field  theory  which  predicts  the  increase  of  the  critical  parameters  with 
decreasing λ [1−5].

BASIC EQUATIONS. 
We will first treat the charge-symmetric (1:1) case and assume that a system of 
charged  cores  at  close-to-critical  temperatures  is  a  gas  of  Bjerrum  doublets  in  the 
"ground"  state,  i.e.,  when  the  charges  come  close  together.  In  this  case,  a  pair  of 
unlike charges is a dipole with the dipole moment

We will construct the Van der Waals equation for a gas consisting of Bjerrum 
doublets. For this purpose, we will use the simplest qualitative procedure described 
by Landau and Lifshitz [7] and based on extrapolating the expression for the second 
virial  coefficient.  The  second  virial  coefficient  B

In writing 

 in the expansion of the Boltzmann component in Eq. (4), Eq. 
(6) retains the first term which gives a nonzero value. It must be emphasized that, in 
 is proportional to the particle 
contrast to the conventional procedure [7], when 
interaction potential, in the case of dipole−dipole interaction, 
 turns out to be 
proportional to the square of that potential, because the angle-averaged value of the 
linear term is zero. The second virial coefficient for a hard-core system with a dipole 
moment was calculated by Hirschfelder al. [6]; however, we cannot directly use this 
result, because the dipoles being treated are soft dumbbells.

CALCULATION RESULTS 

Curves corresponding to relations (20) and (21) are given in Fig. 1 along with 
the  data  of  numerical  experiment  of  Yan  and  Pablo  [2].  The  latter  data  are 
qualitatively  and  quantitatively  correctly  described  by  these  relations.  Note  that  the 
critical  temperature  is  less  dependent  in  the  asymmetry  factor  than  the  critical 
density.  This  is  associated  with  the  root  dependence  of  (18)  on  the  asymmetry 
function 
 and is due to the fact that the attraction component of pressure (11) is 
inversely proportional to temperature; in the traditional Van der Waals equation, this 
component is independent of temperature.

We  will  now  treat  a  system  of  charge-asymmetric  cores  [3,  4]  of  different 
sizes.  It  is  natural  to  assume  that  this  system  of  cores  in  the  vicinity  of  the  critical 
 will consist 
point (because the critical transition temperatures are low compared to 
of  simplest  neutral  complexes,  namely,  triplets  for  the  (2:1)  option  and  quadruples 
for  (3:1).  A  triplet  which  has  the  least  binding  energy  is  a  complex  consisting  of  a 
positively  charged  core  with  two  adherent  negative  cores  spaced  at  the  maximum 
possible  distance  σ
  from  each  other.  A  quadruple  consists  of  a  positively 
charged  core  with  three  adherent  negative  cores  likewise  spaced  at  the  maximum 
possible distance from each other, i.e., their centers are spaced on a circumference at 
120  degrees  from  one  another.  The  total  charge  and  dipole  moment  of  such 
complexes are zero; they exhibit cylindrical symmetry. The interaction between these 
complexes  is  quadrupole-quadrupole.  The  potential  of  such  interaction  decreases 
  and  contains,  as  a  factor,  a  fairly  complex  function  of 
over  long  distances  as 
angular variables, the average of which is zero. It is only the result of averaging the 
square of this function that is other than zero. We will derive the critical parameters 
of  phase  transitions  in  these  systems  using  similarity  relations  to  fit  the  option  of 
charge-symmetric  cores  examined  above.  The  quadrupole  moments  Q   of  the

CONCLUSIONS 

Expressions  for  the  parameters  of  vapor−liquid  phase  transition  recorded  in 
numerical experiments have been suggested on the basis of the assumption about the 
composition of a low-temperature system of charged cores. The suggested theoretical 
interpretation of the results of numerical experiments is based on the assumption that 
the  system  of  charged  cores  at  low  temperatures  is  a  mixture  of  multipolarly 
interacting neutral complexes. The obtained dependence of the parameters of phase 
transition  on  the  asymmetry  parameter  qualitatively  and,  in  a  number  of  cases, 
quantitatively  agrees  with  the  results  of  numerical  simulation  by  the  Monte  Carlo 
method.

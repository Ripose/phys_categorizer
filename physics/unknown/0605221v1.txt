Effect of Feedback on Oscillation Characteristics 
of a Device with Virtual Cathode
A. E. Hramov
Received October 30, 1997

Abstract
—The effect of external feedback on the oscillation characteristics of a device with the virtual cathode
(VC) is investigated by the method of numerical modeling. A strong inﬂuence of the feedback phase delay on
the frequency and power level of signals generated in the system is demonstrated.

Millimeter-wave  devices  operating  on  the  basis  of
the  virtual  cathode  (VC)  with  electron  beams  attract
increasing  interest  as  promising  microwave-power
sources  in  power  engineering,  communications,  and
radiolocation  [1,  2].  In  this  connection,  the  necessity
arises of controlling both the amplitude and frequency
characteristics  of  the  radiation  generated  in  such  sys-
tems. In the future, it may lead to the possibility of cre-
ating super-powerful systems comprising several virca-
tors that operate in parallel [3–5].

Recently, various VC devices with different types of
feedback have been proposed (see, for example, [6, 7])
to control the characteristics of the generated radiation
in the vircator system. Among these devices, the virtod
[6], or an oscillator using external feedback with over-
critical current, is of special interest. The feedback in
the  virtod  is  implemented  by  withdrawing  approxi-
mately 15% of the oscillation power from the region of
the VC formation to the region, in which the relativistic
electron beam is accelerated along the external phase-
delay line.

In  this  paper,  the  effect  of  the  delay  on  the  virtod
oscillation characteristics is investigated using numeri-
cal simulation based on solution to the Maxwell–Vla-
sov self-consistent system of equations [8, 9].

The  system  under  consideration  is  a  cylindrical
waveguide  section.  A  large-current  annular  single-
velocity  electron  beam  with  the  relativistic  factor
 = 2.7 is injected into the system. A sufficiently strong
0
axial magnetic ﬁeld is applied along the system axis, so
that the beam electrons are completely guided by this
ﬁeld.  The  characteristic  feature  of  the  system  is  the
external feedback caused by kinematic modulation of
the electrons entering the drift space by the electromag-
netic  signal  generated  in  the  interaction  space  (in  the
VC  region)  that  inﬂuences  the  beam  with  the  phase
delay 

.

We  investigated  the  system  characteristics  for  a

ﬁxed value of the dimensionless current 
is the ratio of the beam current to the maximum vacuum
current. Note that the given value of the current corre-

 = 2, where 

 

sponds to the maximal efﬁciency of the system without
the feedback (see, for example, [10, 11]).

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the electron inter-
action  power  in  the  system  under  study  on  the  feed-
 and the curve obtained in [6]
back-circuit phase delay 
that  represents  the  results  of  the  experiment  on  loca-
tion. We see a sufﬁciently good qualitative agreement
between the results of simulation and physical experi-
ment.  The  horizontal  line  corresponds  to  the  power
level in the system without the feedback. For the opti-
, the efﬁciency of power exchange in the system
mal 
increases by a factor of 1.5 or more.

Variation of the phase delay 

 when the current is
ﬁxed yields also a readjustment of the oscillation fre-
quency  within  sufﬁciently  broad  limits  (Fig.  2).  This
can be illustrated using the simplest phenomenological
model. In [12], the phase synchronization of the micro-
wave VC oscillator by the external signal is described
by a model based on the Van der Pol equation. In our

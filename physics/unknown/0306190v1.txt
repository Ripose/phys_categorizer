ABSTRACT 
 
According  to  century-old  conventional  wisdom,  the  trajectory  of  a  particle  that  is 
predicted  by  special  relativistic  mechanics  is  well  approximated  by  the  trajectory 
predicted  by  Newtonian  mechanics  if  the  particle  speed  is  low,  i.e.,  much  less  than  the 
speed  of  light.  However,  in  this  paper,  it  is  shown  with  a  counterexample  Hamiltonian 
dynamical  system  that  Newtonian  dynamics  can  eventually  disagree  completely  with 
relativistic  dynamics  even  though the  particle  speed is low. After the breakdown of the 
agreement, the Newtonian description is no longer valid for the low-speed motion, only 
the relativistic description is valid. 
 
 

For  almost  a  century  now,  it  is  thought  (1-6)  that,  in  general,  if  the  speed  of  a 

particle v is much less than the speed of light c, then the dynamical prediction of special 

relativistic mechanics, which is valid for all speeds bounded by c, is well approximated 

by the prediction of Newtonian mechanics. For instance, according to Einstein and Infeld 

(2): ‘The old [Newtonian] mechanics is valid for small velocities and forms the limiting 

case  of  the  new  one.’  However,  in  this  paper,  I  will  show  with  a  counterexample 

dynamical  system  that  the  prevailing  wisdom  is  wrong,  i.e.,  Newtonian  dynamics  can 

eventually deviate completely from relativistic dynamics even though the particle speed 

is low, i.e.,

v

c(cid:19)

.

The  counterexample  is  a  one-dimensional  Hamiltonian,  i.e.,  nondissipative, 

dynamical  system  in  a  sinusoidal  potential  that  is  periodically  turned  on  only  for  an 

instant.  This  periodically  delta-kicked  system  could  either  be  a  pendulum  in  a  time-

varying gravitational field (7,8) or an electron in a time-varying electric field in a plasma 

(9,10). 

Newton’s equation of motion for such a kicked system is easily integrated exactly 

(7,8) to produce a mapping, called the standard map, of the dimensionless scaled position 

X and dimensionless scaled momentum P from  (

served  as  an  important  model  in  the  field  of  nonlinear  dynamics  because  a  number  of 

dynamical problems are approximately reduced to it (7,11). 

The  relativistic  equation  of  motion  is  also  easily  integrated  exactly  (9,10)  to 

produce  a  mapping  of  the  dimensionless  scaled  position  X  and  dimensionless  scaled 

momentum P from (

Detailed  properties  of  the  Newtonian  standard  map  [Eqs.  1(a)  and  1(b)]  and  the 

relativistic  standard  map  [Eqs.  2(a)  and  2(b)]  can  be  found  in  references  (7,11)  and 

(9,10,12) respectively. Here, it suffices to note that the phase-space trajectories generated 

by  the  two  maps  are  either  chaotic  or  nonchaotic,  the  latter  is  either  periodic  or 

quasiperiodic. 

In general, according to special relativistic mechanics,

For the relativistic standard map [Eqs. 2(a) and 2(b)], since  Pβ  (P is the dimensionless 

scaled  momentum)  is  (10)  equal  to 

,  we  can  easily  see  from  Eq.  (4)  that 

1Pβ (cid:19)  

implies  v

c(cid:19)

. So, conventionally, the phase space trajectory generated by the Newtonian 

standard  map  is  expected  to  agree  with  the  phase  space  trajectory  generated  by  the 

relativistic standard map for 

1Pβ (cid:19)  since  v

c(cid:19)

. This expectation seems reasonable at 

first sight because the Newtonian standard map [Eqs. 1(a) and 1(b)], which differs from 

the relativistic standard map only by the square-root term in Eq. 2(b), ‘approximates’ the

. However, in all the cases that have been studied, the 

Newtonian  trajectory  eventually  deviates  completely  from  the  relativistic  trajectory 

although  v

In  this  example,  the  dimensionless  scaled  momentum  P  of  the  relativistic 

trajectory,  with  initial  conditions

, or in other words, v is always merely 0.001% of c 

(for  comparison,  the  orbital  speed  of  the  earth  is  about  10  times  faster).  At  such  low 

speeds (4), it is conventionally expected that the Newtonian trajectory, which is generated 

by the Newtonian standard map with the same parameter K and initial conditions, would 

agree with the relativistic one. 

To  compare  the  two  trajectories  above,  the  Newtonian  and  relativistic  positions 

are plotted versus iteration in Fig. 1 while the Newtonian and relativistic momentum are 

plotted  versus  iteration  in  Fig.  2  for  the  first  140  iterations.  In  each  figure,  successive 

values of the dynamical quantity predicted by each theory are connected by straight line 

to aid the eyes. The following behavior for both the position and momentum can clearly 

be seen in the two figures. The Newtonian values agree with the relativistic values for the 

first 113 iterations. However, contrary to conventional expectation, the Newtonian values 

no  longer  agree  with  the  relativistic  ones  from  iteration  114  onwards.  The  plotted 

Newtonian  and  relativistic  values,  which  were  computed  in  double  precision  (15 

significant  figures),  are  converged,  where  the  degree  of  convergence  decreases  with 

increasing  number  of  iterations.  The  degree  of  convergence  was  established  using  the

standard method (11) of varying the numerical precision: here, by comparing the double 

precision  values  to  the  corresponding  values  computed  in  long  double  precision  (18 

significant  figures).  Hence,  the  breakdown  of  the  agreement  of  the  Newtonian  values 

with the relativistic values, for both position and momentum, after iteration 113 is not a 

numerical artifact. 

numerical artifact. 

In  all  other  cases,  the  convergence  check  also  shows  that  the  breakdown  of  the 

agreement of the Newtonian dynamics with the relativistic dynamics at low speed is not a 

In summary, I have shown with a counterexample Hamiltonian dynamical system 

that,  contrary  to  conventional  wisdom,  the  agreement  of  Newtonian  dynamics  with 

relativistic  dynamics  can  eventually  break  down  even  though  the  particle  speed  is  low, 

i.e.,  much  less  than  the  speed  of  light.  After  the  breakdown  of  the  agreement,  the

description is valid.

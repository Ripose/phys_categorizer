Abstract

A program to design a high brilliance electron source
suitable  for  a  short  wavelength  Linac-based  FEL 
is
presented. The goal of the project is to develop a multi-
cell integrated photoinjector capable of delivering 1  nC
bunches with emittance below 1 mm mrad.

This  will  be 

the  first  step 

toward  a  possible
development of a IV generation light source test facility
based on the existing Trieste Linac. For this purpose a
common program between Sincrotrone Trieste and INFN-
Milano has been undertaken. Here a brief description of
the  program  and  the  first  results  of  the  RF  Gun
electromagnetic structure with the beam dynamics on the
ELETTRA Linac are presented.

1  INTRODUCTION

The growth in interest over the last few years in IV
generation light sources based on FELs and  the  SASE
process [1,2] requires further considerable efforts for the
production of intense low emittance beams. In  fact,  in
order  to  reach  and  operate  these  facilities  at  shorter
wavelengths,  the  electron  beam  emittance  e n,  and  the
coherent radiation wavelength  l
, must be very close to
each other, to guarantee the maximum overlap between
the two beams in phase space. Moreover the efficiency of
the  SASE-FEL  emission  process,  defined  as  the  ratio
between the photon beam power and the electron beam
1/3 with IPK the electron beam peak
power, scales like IPK
current. The previous requirements clearly show that the
real figure of merit for the electron beam is the normalized
brightness, defined as Bn=IPK/4p
2: a FEL in the X-ray
band will require 1014 to 1015 A/m2 and is nowadays the
main challenge to meet. In order to reach these values,
that are at the limit of expected performances for the next
decade, all the laboratories pursuing a long term program
in IV generation radiation sources have begun developing
experiments and test facilities to study the physics of high
brightness  electron  beams.  The  FaBrE  project  can  be
viewed within the same context: its main aim is the study
and construction of a high brightness photo-injector to be
installed on the ELETTRA Linac for a FEL-SASE test
facility in Trieste. This ambitious program will also take
advantage of the future planned upgrading of ELETTRA:
after  the  commissioning  of  the  new  ELETTRA  full
energy injection system [3], the present 1.0 GeV injector
Linac will be available for the proposed test facility.

theoretical  understanding  of 

Despite the large progress in brightness seen in the 90's
by electron sources based  on  RF  photo-injectors,  only
recently  has 
the
phenomenon  of  emittance  degradation,  hence  of  the
achievable  brightness  by  a  photo-injector,  been  made
possible. The success of the "invariant envelope" model,
that concerns the prediction of a new equilibrium mode for
a beam in the  laminar  flow  regime,  [4,5],  will  allow
further  progress  in 
this  strategic  field  enabling  an
optimum control of the emittance growth.

On  this  basis  it  has  been  shown  recently  that  the
"integrated"  photo-injector,  whose 
first  accelerating
section is integrated into the gun itself, has the optimal
configuration to produce a beam satisfying the invariant
envelope conditions when compared to the more popular
"split"  version,  where 
is
physically separated from the gun.

the  accelerating  section 

Starting  from  these  considerations  the  goal  of  the
FaBrE project is the  study  and  the  construction  of  an
integrated photo-injector whose RF structure complies, as
much  as  possible,  with  the  requirements  imposed  by
theory:

i) 

high spectral purity of the accelerating field profile
on the axis;

ii)  normalized  amplitude  of  the  accelerating  field,
a =eE0/2kRFmec2=1.3, corresponding at S-band to a
peak field of 80 MV/m;

iii)  shunt impedance as high as possible (compatible

with the first requirement);

iv)  capability to host a  photo-cathode  in  ultra  high

 10-9 torr);

stability and large separation between contiguous
resonant modes in the operating band.

In order to distribute as much as  possible  costs  and
commitments, the whole program  will  be  divided  into
three different phases.

this year. This phase, already funded, should be completed

the accelerating structure.

transversal mode. An additional shortening and smoothing
of  the  delivered  pulses  are  also  expected  by  further
optimization of the laser cavity and, if necessary, using a
slicing with fast Pockels cell (the latter may turn out to
be necessary in order to avoid cathode damage). The goal

DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS OF THE

ELETTRA LINAC

3.1  General Layout of the machine

long  constant 

A complete desciption of the Trieste Linac can be found
in  [7,8].  Neglecting  the  electron  source  and  the
bunching section, the whole machine consists of two
different parts: i) a 100 MeV preinjector, made up of
two  3.2  m 
impedance  accelerating
sections (S0A, S0B), equipped with focusing solenoids
(up to 2.5 KGauss) and presently operated at 18 MV/m;
ii) the second part of the Linac is made up of seven 6.2
m long BTW accelerating sections (S1 to S7) equipped
with  a  SLED  pulse  compressor  system.  Eight
Thomson TH2132 45 MW klystrons feed  the  whole
machine. The maximum operating  gradient  has  been
reached at 28 MV/m, and the machine can provide a
maximum energy of 1.2 GeV. Keeping fixed the first
100 MeV supplied  by  the  preinjector  the  remaining
sections on average  can  easily  supply  150  (or  100)
MeV/section  with  (or  without)  SLED  respectively.
However one of the 6.2 m sections will be used for the
new full energy injector and the operational energy of
the  test  facility  will  be  between  0.7  and  1.0  GeV
(with/without SLED).

of the second phase, not yet funded, is to have  within
2002 a 12 to 20 MeV electron beam, with 100 to 200 A
peak  current,  and    less  than  5  mm  mrad  normalized
emittance.

Phase III, the photo-injector will be upgraded with a
mode-locked laser system able to deliver very short UV
pulses (230 nm, 10 ps, 200  m J, with rise time and jitter
less than 1 ps). Such  a  performance  can  nowadays  be
obtained by using several different types of mode-locked
systems 
(i.e.  based  on  Nd:glass,  Cr:LiSAF  or
Ti:Sapphire); the final choice will be made on the basis of
further numerical simulations as well as on the experience
gained from phase II. At the end of this phase we expect
to have a 20 MeV pulsed electron beam with roughly 150
A peak current, 1 nC charge, 1 mm mrad emittance and
energy spread better than 1%. The expected quality of the
electron beam will allow the  start-up  of  the  suggested
R&D program installing the photoinjector on the existing
Linac.

3.2  Preliminary beam dynamics studies

Preliminary beam dynamics studies have been carried
out on the  whole  ELETTRA  Linac  to  estimate  the
beam  parameters 
that  could  be  obtained  after
installation of the photoinjector (following phase III).
All of the simulations have been made using the semi-
analytical  code  HOMDYN  and  considering 
the
emittance compensation theory. Even if in the future,
to  reach  lower  emittance,  different  machine  layouts
could be considered, at present, in order to minimize
costs, we have implemented only a slight modification
of the present machine layout, shifting the third Linac
section, S3, and leaving a 10 m drift space  between
sections  S2  and  S3  to  install  the  magnetic  bunch
compressor, see Fig. 1 for a simplified scheme of the
machine layout. Magnetic optics between the sections
is not considered in these preliminary studies.

The photoinjector parameters have been optimized in
order to get a laminar waist and a maximum  of  the
relative emittance at the entrance of S0A, that results to
be  a  suitable  condition 
to  damp  the  emittance
oscillations [9]. The gun energy has been fixed at 20
MeV and the matched accelerating field of the first two
structures results to be 21 MV/m exiting the second
structure at 150 MeV, see Fig. 2 and 3.

4  CONCLUSIONS

An ambitious program for a high brilliance electron
source based on a 20 MeV integrated photoinjector has
been recently initiated at Sincrotrone Trieste under the
FaBrE  collaboration.  The  preliminary  results  are
encouraging and in the near future the beam dynamics
simulations will be extended to include the Linac optics
and  the  effects  of  the  beam  interaction  with 
the
undulator.

Figure 3: Bunch length, beam envelope and transverse
emittance along the Linac.

As shown in Fig. 3, in the drift downstream of S0B
the emittance approaches its absolute minimum. The
beam is then injected in the first two sections of the
second Linac, S1 and S2, 20 degrees off crest at  21
MV/m to provide the necessary energy spread for the
magnetic  compression  expected  at  400  MeV.  The
magnetic compressor is modeled by  HOMDYN  as  a
"one wiggler period" according to the wiggler hard edge
model reported in [10]. The equivalent period results to
be l w=p
2lbend where lbend is the dipole magnet length and
the  equivalent  field  strength  is  Bw=4Bbend/p
.  In  the
present design lbend=0.5 m and Bw=0.11 T; a focusing
gradient in the chicane has also been considered with a
suitable pole shaping. At the exit of the compressor the
average peak current is 300 A, but inside the bunch, as
shown in Fig. 4, the slice peak current reaches higher
values over  approximately  one  quarter  of  the  bunch
length.

In the remaining 4 structures the beam is driven up
to 1 GeV with a further energy spread reduction to 0.4
%. The slight emittance growth shown in Fig. 3 after
the beam compression, is mainly due to a lack in the
required optics to compensate for space charge effects
induced by bunch compression.

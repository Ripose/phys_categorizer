Abstract 
 
In  the  present  paper  a  counter-example  to  Bell's  theorem  is  given  which  is  based  on  common 
probability densities as standard normal (Gaussian) and uniform probability densities. The reason for 
violating the Bell inequalities lies in the 'softening' of functions similar to the Dirac delta such that 
they can be 'hidden' inside a sign function. 
 
Key  words   Einstein,  Podolsky  and  Rosen  paradox,  Bell's  theorem,  probability  theory,  Special 
Relativity and FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction. 

I. Introduction. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It is commonly known that statistics and probability theory are widely applied in physics. Perhaps it is not 

so well known that, in fundamental quantum physics, there exists a statistical problem which appears difficult, if 

not  impossible,  to  solve  with  Kolmogorovian  (McCord  and  Moroney  (1964),  Hogg  and  Graig  (1970),  Mood, 

Graybil and Boes, (1974)) probability theory. In the present paper a solution to this problem is advanced. The origin 

of the problem lies in the Bell inequalities. 

Bell  inequalities,  originally  derived  by  Bell  (1964)  and  later  developed  by,  for  instance,  Greenberger 

(1995) and Mermin (1995), are extremely important to the statistics of experiments in fundamental physics. With 

Bell  inequalities,  Einstein's  doubts  about  the  completeness  of  quantum  mechanics,  Einstein,  Rosen  and  Podolsky 

(1935),  could  be  studied  experimentally.  A  decisive  experiment,  based  on  Bell  inequalities,  was  performed  by 

Aspect, Dalibard and Roger (1982).  

The original argument of  Einstein,  Podolsky  and  Rosen  (EPR),  which  voiced  some  of  Einstein's  doubts 

about the completeness of quantum mechanics, is based on three premises. The first one is the doctrine of realism, 

that  is,  the  observed  phenomena  are  caused  by  physical  realities  whose  existence  is  independent  of  human 

observers. The second one expresses faith in inductive inferential reasoning. The third one states that there are no 

influences possible that travel faster than light. 

The  Bell  inequalities  have  unearthed  a  tremendous  amount  of  research  in  the  physics  and  statistics  of 

experiments. Recent progress has been towards the necessity of Bell inequalities, studied by, for instance, Jordan 

(1994),  loophole-free  tests  of  Bell  inequalities,  studied  by  Fry,  Walther  and  Li  (1995) and continuous variables, 

studied by Tara and Agarwal (1994). In addition, Scully and Cohen (1986) studied the relation between the Wigner 

distribution  function  and  the  EPR  problem,  Jarrett  (1986)  examined  time  dependent  hidden  states  and  Pitowsky 

(1983) investigated the possibility of deterministic models.  

Recent progress has also been towards a change in probability theory. An interesting change is to introduce 

complex  numbers  into  probability  theory.  Studies  in  this  particular  field  are  performed  by,  for instance, Youssef 

(1995) and Gudder (1993).  

The  present  author  will  argue  below,  however,  that  such  a  radical  change  in  probability  theory  is 

unnecessary. Moreover, it is noted that the author (Geurdes (1998 a, b), Geurdes (2001)) already has demonstrated 

that, e.g. complex probability spaces are unneccesary to reduplicate quantum mechanical results from local hidden 

variables models. 

For  completeness  a  short  description  of  the  principles  of  a  typical  Bell  inequality  experiment  will  be 

presented.  The  physical  situation  of  the  Bell  inequalities  refer  to  a  correlation  between  spin  states  of  spatially 

separated particles, originally in the singlet state and arising from a single source. Restricting oneself to electrons, 

the spin of the electron can be seen as the intrinsic magnetic moment of the electron, while the singlet state means 

that  both  electrons  arose  from  the  source  with  opposite  spins.  Simply  stated,  the  EPR  paradox  demonstrates  that 

electrons  maintain  a  correlation  between  their  respective  spin  variables,  despite  of  a  great,  theoretically  infinite, 

spatial  separation.  This  type  of  experiment  is  a  simplification  of  the  original  'Gedanken'  experiment  of  Einstein, 

Podolsky and Rosen.  

 

The  correlation  function,  P(a,b),  representing  a  hidden  variable explanation of the observed correlation 

between, spatially separated, spin measurements, is given by 

d=)b,aP(

(
llr

)A(

l

a,

)B(

l

. )b,

 

1 

Here,  a=(a1,a2,a3) and  b=(b1,b2,b3)  are,  unitary,  parameter  vectors  of  the  measurement  functions  A(a,l )=±1 and 
B(b,l )=±1,  which  are  also  supposed  to  depend  on  the  (set  of)  hidden  variable(s)  l . Here, A=+1, represents, for 

instance,  the  discrete  outcome  'spin-up'  at  the  A  apparatus,  while,  A=-1,  represents  the  discrete  outcome  'spin-

down'. The parameter vectors represent the spatial orientation of the measurement apparatuses. 

Because measurement, A, does not depend on parameter vector, b, while measurement, B, does not depend 

on parameter vector, a, so called Einstein locality is warranted. This means that the real factual situation of system 

S2 is independent of what is done with system S1, which is spatially separated from the former, Einstein (1949). 

In  equation  (1),  the  function,  r =r (l ),  represents  the  probability  density  of  the  local  hidden  variables,  l , 

while the integration is performed over the whole range of hidden variables. Of course, r =r (l ), is also independent 

of the parameter vectors, a, and, b. 

For the correlation function in expression (1), the following inequality 

-)b,aP( |

| )d,aP(

 ,2  )d,cP(+)c,b+P(

 

2 

can  be  derived.  Subsequently  it  can  be  verified  that  the  quantum  correlation,  Pqm(a,b)=-(a1b1+a2b2+a3b3), violates 

this inequality. Hence, it was generally concluded that the local hidden variable correlation cannot be equal to the 

quantum  correlation.  Moreover,  if  in  experiment,  the  inequality  is  violated,  the  quantum  correlation  is,  most 

probably, the correct description of the correlation between spatially separated particles. 

At first instance, the previous argument against local hidden variables appear solid. However, it should be 

noted that the absolute exclusion of hidden variable models, depends on the universal validity of the inequality. The 

total exclusion of local hidden variable models implies that the quantum correlation cannot be reproduced by any 

model within basic probability theory. However, this has not been conclusively proved yet. The only thing that has 

been demonstrated is that the quantum correlation contradicts the inequality. This may appear sufficient evidence 

against all local hidden variables. The scope of the evidence can be questioned nonetheless. 

In section II, a classical probability model is presented that is the probabilistic basis of the model. In section 

III,  it  is  explained  how  to  'soften'  a  Dirac delta function such that it can occur in a sign function and, hence, be 

included in the A and B measurement functions. This part is an important section of the paper because it points to 

the  reason  why  Bell's  theorem  is  incomplete.  In  section  IV,  the  model functions are evaluated. In section V, the 

result is discussed and an alternative way to introduce a singular function, Dirac delta type of function, into a sign 

function is discussed also.  

The  proposed  model  employs  a  classical  probability  density  which  has  three  components.  If  we  write,

the complete integration of a proper function F times the density r

tot is defined by, (F)=(((F)I)II)N. Concludingly, a 

tot. Moreover, 

probability  density  containing  standard  normal  and  uniform  densities  is  employed  in  the  probability  part  of  the 

model. 

III. Measurement equations. 

Subsequently,  the  measurement  functions  A  and  B  are  introduced.  Beforehand  let  us  note  that  A  is 

independent  of  the  bk,  k=1,2,3,  unity,  parameter  vector  for  B,  while,  B  is  independent  for,  ak, k=1,2,3, the unity 

parameter  vector  for  A.  Hence,  locality  in  the  sense  of  Einstein  is  maintained  in  the  measurement  model.  The 

correlation in the model consequently must follow from the postulated local hidden variables, as expressed in the 

probability density function.  

Given the expressions, 

the measurement functions A and B can be expressed by

After having presented the basic needs for evaluating the model, let us turn to the evaluation of the mean (A). First 

we  evaluate  (A)I.  Here,  we  note  that  we  need  to  evaluate  the  three  s-functions, because, the  i j,  j=1,2,3,  refer  to 
exclusive sets. Hence, (s 1I)I, is evaluated. Because,  s a+1 is in the interval [-1,1] in this case, the evaluation over  m 1I, 
results into the term {n I(s a+1)-d 0,nI}. Observing eq.(22) and the approximation in eq. (16), this subsequently leads to

Here we note for completeness that, mI is summed over the set {-1,1}. In a similar way we find that for  i 3=1 we 
have,  (s3I)I=s a.  This  leaves  the  term,  s2I, to be evaluated. In this case, integration over,  m 2I,  leads  to  s a. Because, 
there is no n I dependence in s2I the related sum term leads to unity. Also the sum over mI and the integration over xI 
e -t I], term in s2I. Hence, (s2I)I=s a. This leads to (A)I=s a, 

cancel each other to unity, because there is also no, sign[TD

hence,  because  of  symmetry  of  the  standard  normal  density,  (A)=0,  because,  (1)II=1.  Similarly,  we  find,  (B)=0. 
Secondly, we aim to evaluate the variance (A 2). Here, we also need to evaluate the three s -functions, because, the i j, 
j=1,2,3, refer to exclusive sets. We note

which is the quantum correlation. Note that the  ( ) brackets represent the integrations, while the [ ] are used to keep 

the symbols 'together'. 

V. Conclusion and discussion. 

In the paper it was demonstrated that the quantum correlation can be obtained from a local hidden variables 

model. Unlike previous models of the author, this model has no 'strange' probability density function. In this case, 

the  reason  for  the  violation  lies  in  the  fact  that  a  mathematical  singularity  can  be  hidden  inside  a  sign  function 

which is a valid element of the measurement function. Physically we could interpret this type of model by saying 

that here the blame for the violation is laid on the side of the measuring instruments, not on the side of a strange 

intermediate  of  local  hidden  variables.  In  the  present  model  the  Normal  distributed  variables  take  care  of  the 

binding  together  of  the  two  separate  measurement  results.  In  the  view  of  the  author  this  is  within  the  realm  of 

orthodox classical probability theory and, hence, in the realm of classical physics.  

Possible objections against the hiding of a singularity inside a sign function can alternatively be countered 

by noting that the usual Dirac delta contraction of an ordinary Normal density, is not the only possible expression 

for delta-function behaviour. In that respect, we may note the following definition of an alternative delta function as  

This function can take values of 1, when x=0 and zero, when x„ 0.  This delta function is based on the following 

theta, or Heaviside function, as a derivative of the following theta, 

which is unity when, x‡ 0, while it vanishes when x<0. It can be verified rather easily that the results of the previous 
computations remain unaltered when T is replaced by 1 and the D n functions are written as

Hence, the conclusions of the model remain the same, irrespective of the particular form of 'hidden' singularity one 

prefers to use.  

Concerning  Einstein's  demand  of  realism  and  locality,  it  can  be  concluded  that  both  are  obeyed  in  the 

present model. Concerning the 'physical signals not faster than light' demand, the following remark is made.  

As  is  well  known,  the  axiom  'physical  signals  do  not  travel  faster  than  light'  entails  counter-intuitive 

phenomena like FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction for moving objects and objects at rest. Naturally, the axiom must be 

valid in all kinds of physical situations, hence, also in e.g. a relativistic ideal gas. Suppose we inspect a situation for 

an arbitrary observer, Ok. In the view of Ok we have  

Here, Lk is the unit of length at rest in Ok's frame of reference, while,  b kj=vkj/c, is the (normed) velocity of another 
observer Oj's frame relative Ok's frame and Lkj is the unit of length in motion, relative to observer Ok and carried by 

observer Oj.  

 

Introducing  more  than  two  observers,  Ok  and  Oj,  we  may  introduce  observer  Oi  and  note  that,  Lk=Lki(1-

b 2

ki)1/2. If, furthermore, 1‡

b ki>b kj‡ 0, we may write for Lki and Lkj 

with b 2

Note that, 1-b 2

In  addition to the Ok  'point  of  view'  we  may  also  employ  the  Oj  'point  of  view'.  In  this  case  we  write, 

jk)1/2, where Lj is the unit of length at rest in Oj's frame, b

Lj=Ljk(1-b 2

Hence the theorem: 

Because, bjk=bkj, we only may have, Ljk=Lkj, when, Lj=Lk. 

Subsequently, introducing more observers, Op, Oq and Or (particles in the gas) and performing a similar analysis, 

we may arrive at the following (Geurdes, (2001)). Firstly, when, Lpr=Ljk, from 

Let us furthermore state that, Lj unequal to Lk. From the previous two equations for the 'compound velocities'  b pq;r 
and b ki;j we find that, 

Lp=Ljk(1-b 2

pr)1/2, it follows that 

Secondly, from, Lpq=Lki, the expression Lp=Lki(1-b 2

together with 

such that when, b pq;r=b ki;j, it easily follows that, Ljk=Lkj, despite Lj unequal to Lk.

This example shows that the contradiction may have a physical basis. Moreover, for our purposes, it casts doubt 

upon  Einstein's  third  demand  that  no  physical  signals  may  travel  faster  than  light.  If  the  FitzGerald-Lorentz 

contraction can turn into a contradiction in a serious physical environment such as a relativistic ideal gas, then it is 

not unthinkable that its basic principle, 'physical signals do not travel faster than light' is also not always valid. 

 

Concludingly,  a  counter-example  to  Bell's  theorem  is  found  and  the  premises  on  which  such  theorem  is 

based were discussed. Both theorem as well as its premises turned out to be disputable.

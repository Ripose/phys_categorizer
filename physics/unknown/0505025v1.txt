Abstract. The fundamental equations of relativistic dynamics are derived from a thought 
experiment and from the transformation of relativistic velocity avoiding collisions and 
conservation laws of momentum and energy. 
1. Introduction 

Thought experiments are an antidote for counterintuitive effects associated  with special 
relativity.  Physicists  conceive  them  in  order  to  prove  the  reality  of  the  time  dilation  and  length 
contraction relativistic effects, invoking the principle of relativity. Thought experiments and the 
principle  of  relativity  lead  to  the  relativistic  velocity  transformation,  without  using  the  Lorentz-
Einstein transformations.1,2,3,4,5 

The purpose of our paper is to derive transformation equations for the physical quantities 
introduced in relativistic dynamics: mass, momentum and energy  on the basis of the relativistic 
velocity transformation.6,7,8 The inertial reference frames involved are K(XOY) and K’(X’O’Y’). 
The  corresponding  axes  of  the  two  frames  are  parallel  to  each  other  and  the  OX(O’X’)  axes 
overlap.  K’  moves  with  constant  velocity  V  relative  to  K’  in  the  positive  direction  of  the 
overlapped axes. At the common origin of time in the two frames (t=t’=0) the origins of the two 
frames are instantaneously locate at the same point in space. 

 

2. Weighing a moving body: rest mass and relativistic mass 

We describe first a thought experiment involving a balance set in a gravity field and with 
its  central  pillar  bound  to  the  Earth  (the  K  reference  frame).9  The  pans  move  with  constant 
velocity V0 in the positive and in the negative direction of the OX axis, respectively, starting at a 
time t=0 from the central pillar. After a time t the lengths of the beams are equal to each other and 
equal to V0t.  We place two identical bodies 1 and 2 in the left and in the right pans of the balance, 
respectively. Under such conditions, the balance is in a state of equilibrium with its central pillar 
parallel to the lines of gravity and with its beams perpendicular to them (Figure 1a). In accordance 
with the first postulate the balance should be in a state of equilibrium when observed from the K’ 
reference frame as well, which has its origin O’ in the left pan of the balance. In the K’ reference 
frame, the rest frame of the left pan, located at its origin O’ (Figure 1b).  Relative to this frame the 
central  pillar  moves  with  velocity  V0  whereas  the  right  pan  moves  with  velocity  V  both  in  the 
positive  direction  of  the  overlapped  axes.  In  accordance  with  the  relativistic  velocity 
transformation we have

resulting that in the K’ reference frame the lengths of the two beams are no longer equal to each 
  (2)  whereas  the  length  of  the  right  beam  is 
other.  The  left  beam  has  a  length 

  (3)  , 

  representing  the  time  duration  of  the  motion  measured  in  the 

rest frame of the left pan.

Solving Eq.(1) for V0 we obtain 

and so 

The  body  in  the  left  pan  is  in  a  state  of  rest  in  the  K’  frame  and  relativists  say  that 
observers of that frame measure its rest mass m0. The body in the right pan moves with velocity V 
relative to the K’ frame, observers of that frame measuring its relativistic mass. The balance is in 
a state of equilibrium in the K’ frame if

so 

 

 

   

In the experiment presented above observers measure the gravitational mass. Changes in 
the scenario show that Eq. (7) holds in the case of inertial mass as well. Real experiments confirm 
its validity.10 

Eq. (7) establishes a relationship between two physical quantities measured by observers 
of the same frame, m0 when the particle is in a state of rest  and m when it moves with velocity V.  

2. Relativistic mass and relativistic momentum: How do they transform? 

The scenario we follow involves a particle moving with velocity 

 relative to K 

and with velocity

. It moves in the XOY (X’O’Y’) plane. At the common origin of time 

(t = t’= 0) the particle is instantaneously located at the point where the origins O and O’ meet each 
other. Detected from K the particle moves along a direction θ whereas detected from K’ it moves

derivation does not involve other scenarios. 

The relativistic velocity transformation tells us that u and u’ and their components add as 

The angles θ and θ’ transform as

Observers from K will consider that the momentum of the particle is 

whereas observers at rest in K’ will consider that the momentum of the same particle is 

Many authors start with similar assumptions but use the conservation of momentum law. 

We avoid such an approach.  

The  thought  experiment  presented  in  Section  2  warns  the  two  physicists  that  m  and  m’ 

are relativistic masses and they know that u and u’ are relativistic velocities. 

Combining equations (13) and (14) and taking into account Eq. (10) we obtain

The  unknown  function  f(V)  depends  only  on  the  relative  velocity  V  and  not  on  the 
physical  quantities  involved  in  the  transformation  process  (to  one  particle  in  the  K  frame 
corresponds  a  single  particle  in    K’  and  vice-versa,  a  condition  called  “linearity  of  the 
transformation  equations”).  Physicist  R  considers  the  situation  when  the  particle  is  at  rest  in  K’ 
(u’=0)  moving  with  velocity  V  relative  to  himself.  Under  such  conditions  observers  from  K’ 
measure the rest mass m0 of the involved particle, and Eq. (17) becomes 

Comparing Eqs. (7) and (18) we obtain

The components of the momentum transform as 

As we see, the OY(O’Y’) component of the momentum is a relativistic invariant. 

We can present now Eq. (17) as 

Relativists call p and p’ defined by Eqs. (13) and (14) relativistic momentum, and we can 

express them as

to  confusion  ,  we  derive  transformation  equations  free  of  this  concept.  We  mention  that  the 
concept of relativistic mass has its defenders.14 

The  concept  of  relativistic  momentum  and  its  relation  to  relativistic  mass  play  a 
fundamental part in relativistic dynamics. In most introductory treatments, the expression for the 
relativistic momentum is found by considering collisions between two particles from two inertial 
reference frames in relative motion using the law of momentum conservation.15,16,17 We underline 
that we have derived it without using conservation laws or collisions.  

For more fun, we present a two-line derivation of the relativistic momentum. Let R’ be 
an  observer  commoving  with  the  particle.    An  observer  R  from  K  could  define  the  particle’s 
momentum as

3. The photon 

We  replace  the  particle  we  have  considered  so  far  with  a  photon,  “a  quantum  of  light 
energy,  regarded  as  a  discrete  particle,  having  zero  rest  mass,  no  electric  charge  and  an 
indefinitely long lifetime” and moves with velocity c relative to all inertial reference frames. An 
electromagnetic wave carries energy E (heats a body it hits) and momentum p (exerts pressure on 
the body it hits).15 Equation 

relates  momentum  and  energy  the  electromagnetic  wave  carries.  Considering  that  an  invariant 
number of photons carry p and E then equation 

relates  momentum  and  energy  carried  by  a  single  photon.  Detected  from  K  the  photon  moves 
  relative  to  the 
along  a  direction  θc  whereas  detected  from  K’  it  moves  along  a  direction 
positive direction of the overlapped axes, respectively. The components of its velocity are

The OX(O’X’) component of the photon’s momentum transforms as 

whereas its OY(O’Y’) component is a relativistic invariant 
 

. 

 

 

 

 

 

The magnitude of the photon’s momentum transforms as 

Because  the  quotient 

  is  a  relativistic  invariant,  the  photon’s  energy  should 

transform as 

Multiplying both sides of Eq. (22) with c2, it becomes 

Comparing Eq. (20) with Eq. (38) and Eq. ( 21) with Eq. (36), respectively, we see that 
 from the corresponding transformations for

 by simply replacing u’ by c. Eq. (39) leads to Eq. (38) if we follow the same procedure 

as in the case of the momentum (u’

We stress that mc2 and m’c2 have the physical dimensions of energy.

We now have all the elements needed to eliminate the concept of relativistic mass. We 

can express the OX(O’X’) component of the momentum as a function of energy as

Eqs.  (41)  and  (42)  express  the  so  called  mass-energy  equivalence  in  K  and  in  K’

energy. Presented as

Eq. (47) tells us that an increase in the energy of a particle increases its inertia. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

4. An identity that generates the energy-momentum four vector 

We start with the obvious identity 

The  relativistic  identity  still  holds  if  we  multiply  both  sides  of  Eq.  (48)  with  the 

invariant

and we have derived that way a relativistic invariant. In the general case it becomes 

Relativists introduce the concept of energy-momentum three vector, the components of 

which are 

 in K and 

 in K’ respectively. 

In accordance with Eq. (50) we have

(51) 

in  a  three  space  dimensions  the  OZ(O’Z’)  component  of  the  momentum  being  a  relativistic 
invariant. 

Applied to the case of a photon (

), Eq. (49) tells us that its rest mass is equal to 

zero, a photon existing only when it moves with velocity c. The energy of a photon incident on a 
blackbody  increases  its  internal  energy  and  in  accordance  with  the  postulate  of  mass-energy 
equivalence (Eq. (47)) it increases its inertia as well.

4. Conclusions 

We  derive  the  fundamental  equations  of  relativistic  dynamics  starting  with  a  thought 
experiment, which warns physicists that we should make a net distinction between the mass of a 
particle in a state of rest (invariant or rest mass) and the mass of the same particle when it moves 
relative to the observer (relativistic mass). The interpretation of a thought experiment in which an 
observer weights a moving body involves the first postulate and the transformation of relativistic 
velocity leading to a relationship between rest mass and relativistic mass. 

We also derive the expressions for the relativistic momentum, for the transformation for 

mass and momentum without using conservation laws of momentum and mass. 

The concept of relativistic energy is introduced considering that special relativity ensures 
a  smooth  transition  from  the  formulas  that  describe  the  dynamic  properties  of  a  tardyon  to  the 
formulas that describe the dynamic properties of a photon (‘Natura non facit saltus” Leibniz) and 
the  transformation  of  energy  is  derived  without  using  the  laws  of  momentum  and  energy 
conservation.  

For those who want to avoid the concept of relativistic mass we have derived formulas 

that ban it.  

 

Our approach reveals the importance of thought experiments in simplifying the teaching 
of  special  relativity  and  makes  the  relativistic  effects  less  counterintuitive.  It  also  reveals  the 
kinematical roots of relativistic dynamics. 

Deriving  all  the  fundamental  equations  of  relativistic  dynamics  from  a  single  scenario 

makes relativistic dynamics easy to teach and to learn.

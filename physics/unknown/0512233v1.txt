Relativity, time reversal invariance in mechanics and principle of causality can be in 

the bases of a type of vibration of the extensive objects. It is because, the detailed analysis of 

the relativistic movement of an extensive body entail that all the objects must have inherent a 

vibratory movement to their own size. Such effect does not happen when it works with point 

particles thus is not stranger who happens unnoticed in the traditional studies. 

Also we can find relation between the form of vibration of the extensive objects and 

the energy that calculates by quantum considerations.

Introduction. 

Usually,  the  mathematical  developments  and  models  that  are  used  in  classic  and 

relativistic  physics  are  supported  in  the  concept  of  material  point.  This  technique  is  very 

useful in many cases, but in others it can suppose a problem because it prevents to determine 

some exclusive phenomena of the objects that have extension. 

In  the  detailed  analysis  of  the  relativistic  movement  of  a  body  we  observed  that 

relativity, with the time reversal invariance in mechanics and the principle of causality entail 

to  that  all  the  extensive  objects  must  have  inherent  a  vibratory  movement  which 

manifestation  is  not  easy  to  understand  from  the  point  of  view  of  the  physics  of  material 

points. 

The Lorentz contraction. 

In the classic relativistic study of the movement of extensive bodies in inertial frames 

of reference, is deduced the phenomenon known like Lorentz contraction. This phenomenon 

is studied of the following way: 

Let s’ a inertial reference frame in which the extensive object is in rest. Be also, the 

movement of the extensive object respect to the referential inertial frame s, according to the 

direction  of  the  X  axis,  with  a  speed  v,  being  “begin”  and  “end”  the  ends  of  the  extensive 

object throughout that direction. In this case, the rest length of the object is l0 = x’end – x’begin, 

while in the frame in which the object is in movement the length is l = xend – xbegin. 

According to Lorentz transformations in the change of a one inertial frame to another, 

it obtained (being c the light speed):

In  order  to  measure  the  object  length  l,  the  light  rays  that  beginning  in  “begin”  and 

“end” of the object must arrive simultaneously to the observation point in the frame s. For it, 

tbegin = tend . Replacing it has left:

Consequently, when one object with rest length l0 is moving in an inertial frame with 

a v constant velocity, the length l measurein this frame will be:

This expression is known like Lorentz contraction.  

This development is totally correct from an aprioristic point of view. That is to say, if 

we suppose that, independently of the causes that have originated the movement of the body 

respect to the inertial frame s, the object is moving with constant speed in the frame.  

Nevertheless, the fact that an extensive object can be moved as a whole with constant 

speed in an inertial frame is a questionable hypothesis because, in relativity, the interactions 

do not travel instantaneously between two points, but that take a time in arriving from a point 

at another one because the maximum velocity is the speed of the light. Consequently, all the 

bodies are deformable and all movement necessarily deforms to the bodies. 

This  fact  forces  to  ask:  Can  exist  in  relativity  no-punctual  objects  that  move  like  a 

whole in an inertial frame?  

 

Let us suppose that we have an extensive body in rest and at a moment we applied an 

interaction that puts it in movement. Passed a smaller time than the lapse taken by the light in 

crossing all the length of the body, this will be become deformed because some parts of him 

are  in  movement  and 

others  are  in  rest.  Only 

when 

the 

light  has 

crossed  the  totality  of 

the  body  this  fulfils  the 

conditions 

of 

the 

Lorentz contraction.  

 

 

Nevertheless, 

once  this  deformation 

finishes,  that  is  to  say, 

 

 

 

 

 

when  the  light  has  already  surpassed  the  totality  of  the  extension  of  the  object,  Is  its  final 

state  deformed  (Lorentz  contraction)  or  maintains  an  internal  expansion-contraction 

movement in him like an internal vibration existed? 

In  order  to  make  an  approach  to  this  problem,  in  the  present  work  we  are  going  to 

study as it is the form of the movement of a simple system formed by an precise object that 

hits  against  two  united  precise  particles  through  a  holonomic  constraints.  Through  this 

scheme and its properties we will be able to generalize the form in which the movements of 

the extensive bodies and their properties take place. 

The collision of a particle against a punctual particle pair. 

We are going to analyze the classic relativistic problem of the collision of a no-polar 

punctual particle to against punctual particle pair united by a holonomic constraints L that in 

rest has a length l (that we will call in brief  “pair”). In this case the sequence of the collision 

comes illustrated in the graphic 1.  

 

 

 

 

In  this  graph,  for  t  =  1  we  see,  in  red  the 

incident  punctual  particle  (we  showed  it  like  a 

small single sphere so that its position is appraised 

well)  that  moves  with  speed  v  towards  the  pair 

formed  by  two  identical  in  mass  and  united 

punctual particles by means of a constraints L. 

For  t  =  2  takes  place  the  perfectly  elastic 

collision.  For  t  =  3  the  movement  to  the  first 

particle of the pair is transmitted, being the incident 

particle in rest. 

For  t  =  4  and  5  it  is  appraised  that,  the 

transmission of the movement is not instantaneous, 

because  it  travels  at  an  equal  terminal  velocity  at 

the speed of the light, since the first particle of the 

pair is put in movement until it is put in movement 

second spends a time during which, constraints L diminishes its length.  

For t = 6, finally, the third punctual particle is put in movement so that, the speed of 

the  pair,  according  to  the  law  of  conservation  of  the  linear  moment,  is  of  v/2  and  the  final 

length  of  the  segment,  according  to  the  known  phenomenon  as  Lorentz  contraction  is

The apparent violation of the time reversal or of the causality. 

Nevertheless,  the  previous  scheme  has  a  serious  disadvantage:    Apparently  the 

conservation of the time reversal or the causality principle is violated. 

Let us determine the first two following definitions: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

•  The time reversal invariance says that, in mechanics, if a phenomenon occurs in the 

nature, when changing the direction of the time such phenomenon is also physically 

possible. 

•  On  the  other  hand,  the  causality  principle  says  that  all  events  are  been  from  those 

events that precede temporarily to it with a positive interval.  

Having this in account we analyze the problem 

of  the  time  reversal  of  the  previous  collision.  In  a 

temporary investment the previous graphs must follow 

one  another  in  inverted  order.    That  is  to  say, 

consecutively  in  graphic  1  from  t  =  6  to  1.  Now  we 

will represent in Graphic 2 from t = 1 to 6. 

In these conditions we were now with a causal 

problem: beginning in graphic 2, in t = 2 we would be 

that,  without  apparent  reason,  the  second  particle  of 

the pair stops its movement, transmitting it to the first 

particle.    In  t  =  3  and  4  the  shutdown  of  the  second 

particle is transmitted through the constraints until the 

particle first.  

In t = 5 the movement is transmitted from the 

pair until the particle in rest and, in t = 6, the particle 

moves away of the pair. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

It  is  possible  to  be  appreciated  that  in  this  process  t  =  2  supposes  one  pretends 

violation of the causality principle, because, the second particle of the pair is stopped without 

a previous cause. 

Due  to  this  opportune  and  no-causal  shutdown  of  only  one  of  particles  of  the  pair, 

produce  an  increase  of  the  length  of  the  constraints.  This  event  is  undoing  the  Lorentz 

contraction while the shutdown of one individual particle of the pair is transmitted, through 

the constraints. We say that the shutdown is opportune because it makes agree the moment of 

length in rest of the tie with the collision of this particle of the pair against the free particle. 

Now we entered the true nature of the created problem: 

• 

If  special  relativity  preserves  the  causality,  the  inverse  sequence  is  not  possible 

(because  in  graphic  2,  t  =  2  would  violate  the  causality  principle).  That  is  to  say, 

special relativity would violate the time reversal. 

• 

If special relativity preserves the time reversal the inverse sequence must be possible 

and special relativity would violate the causality principle. 

How  must  it  be  an  elastic  collision  according  to  the  laws  of  the  causality  for  initial 

conditions like those of the previous process?. At first the speed of particles of the pair would 

have to stay constant until the incident particle of the pair hit against the free particle. In this 

case, the graphical representation must have the form of the graphic 3. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This  representation  has  serious  disadvantages, 

all  derivatives  from  the  same  cause:  As  the  incident 

particle  of  the  pair  hits  first  against  the  free  particle 

(graphic  3,  t  =  2)  yielding  its  momentum  (t  =  3)  and 

therefore stopping itself, the second particle of the pair 

cannot  yield  its  moment  to  the  free  particle  without 

violating the causality, that is to say, the passage from 

the t = 3 to 5 is impossible. 

Another  one  of  the  problems  we  found  it 

carrying  out  the  time  reversal  of  this  last  situation. 

Passing from the t = 5 to the 3 is causally impossible. 

Consequently,  the  evident  form  of  elastic 

collision  between  a  pair  and  a  punctual  particle,  if  it 

happens  simply  by  direct  bonding  of  one  of  particles 

of the pair, violates the causality, again. 

The vibratory movement of the extensive objects. 

We are going to return to raise the aligned direct collision of a particle with the pair. 

Now we will analyze separately the speeds of each one of punctual particles of the pair and 

their mutual interaction and will continue our observations during a longer time period. The 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

corresponding graph is the graphic 4.  

When  we  analyzed  the  movement  of 

each  one  of  the  parts  of  the  pair,  we  are 

forced  to  consider  the  constraint  as  another 

part  of 

the  deformed  object  and 

its 

deformation  is  due  to  maintain  the  causal 

consistency and to allow the conservation of 

the  laws  of  the  mechanics  before  the  time 

reversal. 

The  resulting  analysis  of  this  elastic 

collision is the following one:  the pair, like a 

whole,  besides  to  move  its  center  of  masses 

at  a  certain  speed,  maintains  a  vibration 

movement 

 

This  vibration  is  a  necessary  result 

phenomenon  of  the  elastic  collision  with  an 

extensive  object  when  we  consider 

the 

relativistic  phenomena  such  as 

the  not 

instantaneous 

transmission 

of 

the 

interactions.  

Up to here, we have used the 

frame 

in  which 

the 

incident 

punctual  particle  is  in  rest  after  the 

collision.  The  vibration  of  the  pair 

after the collision is appraised better 

in  a  frame 

that  moves 

in 

the 

direction  of 

the 

initial 

incident 

particle  with  an  equal  speed  to  the 

center of mass. 

The graphic 5 corresponding 

to 

this 

reference 

frame 

(we 

remembered  to  apply  the  Lorentz 

contraction due to the movement of 

the frame). 

In  these  graphic  it  is  seen 

that  the  collision  between  the  pair 

and  the  punctual  particle  task,  in 

addition to the interchange of lineal 

momentum, a vibration in the pair. 

 

 

 

The  process  of  "flux"  of 

kinetic energy through the constrain 

between  two  punctual  particles  of 

the  pair  is  appraised  now  better. 

This  effect 

is  appraised  better 

thanks  to  the  colour  that  we  have 

applied  on  the  constrain.  Thus  we 

found that the laws of the causality 

as of the time reversal are conserved 

as much. 

 

The form of the movement of the pair after the collision with a punctual particle is, by 

all the sight up to here, a vibration. 

In  general,  all  movements  are  produce  by  the  linear  momentum  transmission,  or  by 

the collision of a particle or the interaction with a field (the crash “emission-absorption” with 

particles  of  such  field).  Because,  in  any  case,  the  transmission  of  the  movement  within  the 

pair  does  not  take  place  of  instantaneous  way,  after  a  collision  or  interaction,  a  pair  of 

punctual particles must be in vibration state. 

Consequently,  all  pair  of  punctual  particles  in  movement  will  have  to  show  a 

movement of vibration due to the transmission of such movement by the constraint that unites 

to them. 

Supposing the simplest case, in our analysis there are assumption, in all the cases, that 

before the collision the particles of the pair were not in movement. Nevertheless, a priori this 

idea  is  not  correct  by  several  reasons.  At  first,  the  own  existence  of  the  pair  implies  the 

interaction  between  both  particles  of  the  pair  and  since  the  interaction  cannot  travel  of 

instantaneous  form  through  the  length  of  the  constrain,  the  formation  of  the  pair  forces  a 

vibratory movement. 

But on the other hand, if a pair of particles united by a constrain maintained a state of 

no vibration, this would lead until a problem with the principle of relativity because the laws 

of the physics would be different in two inertial frames of reference. 

Let us suppose that in an inertial frame of reference a pair (in movement or rest) did 

not vibrate.  In order to conserve the causality and the time reversal in another inertial frame 

in movement with the first, the pair would have to vibrate. Nevertheless, as it is deduced of 

the  Lorentz  transformations,  the  frequency  of  vibration  (ν)  of  a  body  in  the  change  of  a 

inertial frame to another one with speed vs verifies the expression (ω angular frequency):

That  is  to  say,  the  vibration  frequency  diminishes  with  the  speed,  tending  to  zero 

 

when the speed tends to c.  

another one. 

Consequently, it is impossible that a pair vibrates in a frame and does not vibrate in 

The only one solution to conciliate relativity, time reversal and causality, as well as 

the  mechanic  formation  of  the  pairs  (by  mutual  interactions  between  particles)  consists  of 

considering that all pair of particles and therefore all extensive body have a natural state of 

We  will  call  factor  of  vibration  RTC  to  the  no-contradiction  between  relativity,  the 

time reversal and the causality like cause of the state of fundamental vibration of an extensive 

Calculus of the vibration parameters of a pair. 

 

Let  us  suppose  an  approach  for  the  vibration 

problem  by  factors  RTC  to  the  movement  of  a  pair  of 

particles with rest mass m0 united by a wharf with elastic 

constant k. 

In  this  system  the  vibration  angular  frequency  of  the  pair  in  the  first  relativistic

Can  RTC  vibration  offer  an  explanation  to  the  quantum 

phenomenon? 

As well it is known, the quantum mechanics part from the supposition of which the 

physical objects and very especially the subatomic particles behave simultaneously like wave 

and corpuscle. The mathematical model of this behavior is implemented in the wave function. 

It  is  possible  to  be  observed  that  all  the  known  subatomic  particles,  with  mass, 

although  their  dimensions  are  very  small  they  are  extensive  objects.  Even  the  electron,  the 
smaller  particle  with  mass,  has  a  classic  radius  of2.818·1015  m.  Its  value  is  not  excellent 

 

 

 

(

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

because  this  numerical  result  is  not  obtained  by  totally  quantum-relativistic  analysis. 

Nevertheless, it is excellent the fact that it has an extension. 

Thus, all the extensive subatomic particles are subject to vibrations by effects RTC. 

That  is  to  say,  RTC  effects  imply  a  vibration  in  all  the  macroscopic  objects  as  much  as 

microscopic, like the quantum phenomenon. 

In  our  previous  development,  by  facility,  we  have  initiated  from  the  quantum 

expression  of  the  energy  for  a  state  of  vibration  with  quadratic  form  for  potential  energy. 

Nevertheless, the expression (2) can be deduced by classic mechanical analysis relativistic in 

the next form. 

In a vibratory movement the speed of the particle is proportional to the product of the 

frequency by the displacement: vp ∝ ω·l. 

The speed in the vibratory movement is limited and out of phase in 90º respect to the 

displacement therefore, for n periods we obtain (n + ½)·vp ≈ ω·l. 

Multiplying  both  members  by  the  constant  1/c2  and  multiplying  and  dividing  the 

second member by the mass we obtain

From relativity, the term mc2 represents the energy of the system. On the other hand, 

since  the  energy  that  can  emit  a  vibrant  pair  is  finite,  it  is  to  say:

E

)( νν d

+∞<

,  then,  a 

∞

value exists of ν  that it makes maximal to the energy. Whichever greater it is the frequency 

of vibration (and therefore of radiation) of the pair, greater is the energy of the system, being 

linear the relation between both, for small speeds of the pair particles: E

 max ∝ ν 0. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

This reasoning is altogether experimental agreement with the law of the displacement 
of  Wien  immediately  than  to  observe  than  E  =  3/2  kT  and  that  λν = c  (being  here  k  the 

constant  of  Boltzmann  and  T  the  temperature  corresponding  to  the  energy  of  the  pair). 

Replacing, we found the expression of the law of the displacement: λ0Τ = constant. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Then, the energy of the vibrant pair will be proportional to the frequency of vibration 

of the pair, is to say mc2 ∝ ν . We called h to the proportionality constant and replacing in the 

expression  (3)  we  were  able  to  obtain  the  expression  (2),  with  no  need  to  use  quantum 

postulates. 

A  concrete  case  of  vibrant  pair  hold  to  these  considerations  is  the  mesons  particles. 

These are composed by two quarks united by a constrain formed by the strong nuclear force. 

This  is  indeed  the  scheme  studied  in  the  present  work.  Consequently  the  inns  must  have  a 

form of characteristic vibration similar to the obtained one in the previous expressions. 

In  the  present  work  we  have  been  centred  in  the  study  of  the  vibrant  pairs. 

Nevertheless,  the  vibrations  by  factors  RTC  must  happen  in  any  extensive  bodies.  For  this 

reason, these vibrations can justify the quantum phenomena. 

Conclusions 

1.  All extensive body, due to factors RTC, is in vibration state. 

2.  Applying the quantum considerations it is observed that the vibration energy and the 

3.  Theoretical  justification  exists  to  associate  the  phenomena  of  vibration  by  effects 

product m0l0 are quantized.

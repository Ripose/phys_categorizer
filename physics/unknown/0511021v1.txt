Abstract 
 

 
The frequency distribution of personal given names offers important evidence about the 
information economy.  This paper presents data on the popularity of the most frequent 
personal given names (first names) in England and Wales over the past millennium.  The 
popularity of a name is its frequency relative to the total name instances sampled.  The 
data show that the popularity distribution of names, like the popularity of other symbols 
and artifacts associated with the information economy, can be helpfully viewed as a 
power law.  Moreover, the data on name popularity suggest that historically distinctive 
changes in the information economy occurred in conjunction with the Industrial 
Revolution.    
 

 
 
 
The symbolic choices of ordinary persons are becoming more extensive and more 
significant.  New information and communications technologies provide new capabilities 
for manipulating bits of information.  These technologies give ordinary persons in their 
daily lives more extensive opportunities to choose among symbols, to re-arrange 
symbols, and to share symbols.  Human work is becoming less like farming and more 
like singing.  The information economy – the way persons make symbolic choices and 
the aggregate effects of such choices – increasingly matters for economic growth, 
industrial organization, and social life. 
 
The frequency of personal given names provides important historical evidence about the 
information economy.  Persons who have the same given name literally share the 
experience of being called by that name.  The frequency distribution of names thus 
indicates an aspect of shared symbolic experience.  Choosing a good name involves 
assessing the social valuation of a name.  The frequency distribution of names thus 
provides evidence about symbolic valuation.  Naming is often governed by norms, such 
as naming after parents, godparents, biblical figures, or deceased siblings.  These norms – 
common laws in the economy of names – evolve through awareness of patterns of cases 
and possibilities for differences and exceptions.  They too are aspects of the information 
economy.  More abstractly, the frequency distribution of personal names, graphed as the 
logarithm of name popularity against the logarithm of name popularity rank, looks 
similar to other frequency or popularity distributions where persons and organizations are 
free to create and choose among many collections of symbols instantiated and used in a 
similar way.  Thus naming appears to be representative of patterns of behavior in the 
information economy. 
 
This paper shows that, since early in the nineteenth century, the frequency distribution of 
personal given names in England has evolved differently than it did over the previous 
eight centuries.  Simple indicators of this change are the trend in the popularity 
(frequency relative to the total number of names in the sample) of the most frequent 
names.   The popularity of the most frequent name, the three most frequent names, and 
the ten most frequent names show no trend from circa 1300 to 1800.  Since then all these 
measures have dropped dramatically.   This latter development reflects a "flattening" in 
the name frequency distribution, viewed as a graph of the logarithm of name popularity 
against the logarithm of name popularity rank.   This change in the evolution of the name 
frequency distribution early in the nineteenth century may indicate a more general change 
in the information economy about that time.

I.  Popularity of the Most Frequent Personal Given Names 
 
This section provides data on the popularity of the most frequency personal given names 
in England over the past millennium.  Measuring name frequencies in actual samples 
requires attention to name definition and standardization.  Given names can include 
multiple names and name variants, as well as abbreviations, non-standard spellings, and 
mistakes in recording. Unlike sampling variability, coding variability does not fall with 
sample size.  Throughout the analysis in this paper, names have been truncated to the 
shorter of either the first eight letters of the given name or the letters preceding the first 
period, space, hyphen, or other non-alphabetic character.  These shortened names have 
then been standardized through a name coding available on the Internet for public 
inspection, use, and improvement on an open source basis.3  This procedure attempts to 
identify feasibly and consistently names with common communicative properties.4  
Experience with different name samples suggests that this procedure can reduce coding 
variability to less that half a percentage point for the popularity of a single name and less 
than three percentage points for total popularity of the top ten names (Galbi 2001, Sec. 
I.B. and Appendix B). 
 
Over the past two hundred years, the popularity of the most frequent personal given 
names in England and Wales has steadily declined.  Table 1 shows popularity statistics 
for the most frequent names. In England and Wales from 1800 to 1994, the popularity of 
the most frequent female and male names fell from 23.9% and 21.5% to 3.4% and 4.2%, 
respectively.  The popularity of the ten most frequent names for females and males fell 
from 82.0% and 84.7% to 23.8% and 28.4%, respectively.

Prior to the beginning of the nineteenth century, the popularity of the most frequent 
personal given names in England was higher and more stable.  Tables 2 and 3 provide 
evidence on name popularity from late in the eleventh century through early in the 
nineteenth century.  From 1300 to 1800, popularities of 20%, 50%, and 80% seem to be 
roughly representative figures for the top name, top three names, and top ten names for 
both females and males.  As Table 1 shows, the corresponding figures for the late 
twentieth century are much lower – about 4%, 10%, and 25%.

Significant changes prior to 1800 seemed to have a relatively small effect on the pattern 
of name popularity.  The Norman Conquest of England in 1066 brought about an almost 
complete change in given names.  Within a few generations, most persons used given 
names brought by the invaders.  By about 1250, pre-Conquest names had essentially died 
out.5  The influx of new names and the shift to them must have decreased the popularity 
of the most popular names until the new naming practices were well established 
throughout society.   Yet only about a hundred years after the Conquest the popularity of 
the most popular male names in Winchester had risen to a level closer to that in 1300 and 
1800 than that in the late twentieth century.   The information economy of the twelfth 
century supported an astonishing capacity for dissemination of information (new names) 
and creation of social information (the pattern of popular names).  The relatively high 
name popularity prior to 1800 was not simply an artifact of inertia created by naming 
norms or underdevelopment of the information economy.

II.  A Better View of Changes over the Past Two Hundred Years 
 
Changes in the popularity of the most frequent name, most frequent three names, and 
most frequent ten names are part of a larger order of change that can be easily recognized 
graphically.  Scholars analyzing personal given names have recognized that graphs of 
name frequencies have a characteristic shape (Eschel, 2001; Tucker, 2001; Galbi, 2001).   
The graph of the logarithm of name popularity against the logarithm of name popularity 
rank is the same as a graph of name frequencies, except that the left axis is labeled is 
more easily understood units.6  The graph typically is nearly a straight line.  This type of 
empirical regularity is called a power law.  It describes the relative frequency or 
popularity of names.  Hence a power law describes a relationship between the popularity 
of the most frequent name, the three most frequent names, and the ten most frequent 
names 
 
Over the past two hundred years, the change in the popularity of the most frequent names 
has been associated with a flattening of the power law that best describes the name 
popularity distribution.  Charts 1 and 2 show these graphs for names of females and 
males born in England and Wales in 1819-30 and in 1994.   In both cases the slope of a 
line approximating the graph has become less negative.  This means that the relative 
name popularities have become more equal.  This change can be interpreted as a 
reduction in the magnitude of information encoded in the name distribution and an 
increase in the extent of personalization in naming (Galbi 2001, Sec. II.B).

Empirical regularities such as those in Charts 1 and 2 are in fact prevalent in the 
information economy.  Where persons and organizations are free to create and choose 
among many collections of symbols instantiated and used in a similar way, the relative 
popularity of the symbolic artifacts typically follows a power law.  Thus the circulation 
of magazines of similar type has followed power laws throughout the twentieth century.  
The total box office receipts of movies follow a power law.  The popularity of musical 
groups, as measured by “gold records,” follows a power law (Chung and Cox, 1994).  
The popularity of Internet web sites, measured in users or page views, also follows a 
power law (Adamic and Huberman, 2000).  Insights into the evolution of such power 
laws over time from study of names might contribute to more general insights into 
personal preferences, media diversity, information industry structure, and other aspects of 
the information economy.  
 
 
III. Understanding the Changes 
 
Although recent work on personal given names in England has emphasized name-sharing 
practices for understanding the frequency distribution of given names (Smith-Bannister, 
1997), name-sharing practices have little direct relationship to the frequency distribution 
of names.  Naming a significant share of children after parents, or after godparents, are 
equally consistent with a high or low popularity of the most frequent names.  Similarly, 
having names freely chosen, i.e. chosen in absence of norms giving high value to the 
name of a person in a specific social position in relation to the person to be named, could 
produce high or low popularity of the most frequent names.  The most that can be said for 
name-sharing is that a norm of naming after parents creates additional inertia in name 
popularity.  Name popularity and its long-term evolution depend on factors other than 
name-sharing.  The evolution of the name frequency distribution over time is a 
complicated dynamic system.  Such systems can, in some circumstances, be highly 
sensitive to a particular factor, while in other circumstances, be totally unaffected by that 

 

9

factor.  Moreover, boundary conditions, such as a small share of naming done in violation 
of prevailing norms, can determine the over-all state of the system.7 
 
Analysis of long-term trends in personal given names in England and Wales suggests that 
significant changes in the information economy occurred in conjunction with the broad 
social and economic changes called the Industrial Revolution.  The Industrial Revolution 
is associated with more rapid growth in population.  The population of England in 1800 
was about 50% greater than in 1300, while its population in 2000 was about six times 
greater than in 1800.  The Industrial Revolution is also associated with much more rapid 
growth in income: real economic income per person probably increased by about a factor 
of four from 1300 to 1800, and by about a factor of 100 from 1800 to 2000.8  But 
populations of much different sizes show similar naming patterns (Eshel (2001), Galbi 
(2001) Table 4), and it is not clear how the level of income itself would effect naming.  
The Industrial Revolution also produced major changes in social networks and the social 
context of personal activity.  These changes probably drove changes in the information 
economy. 
 
Whether information and communication technologies have created or will create a “new 
economy” is an important public policy issue.  These technologies enable persons to 
interact in new ways that may be as significant as the changes associated with the 
Industrial Revolution.  Consider, for example, the creation of knowledge about aggregate 
patterns of personal given names.  Large compilations of name frequencies can be easily 
shared on the Internet.  I have benefited from such sharing of information in writing this 
paper, and I have made much more extensive data on name frequencies than can be 
reported in this paper freely available on the Internet.9  If other scholars use the Internet 
in similar ways, this sub-field of onomastics could develop much more rapidly than it has 
in the past.  The same might be true of many other areas of activity.  Analyzing the 
popularity distribution of personal given names thus offers a particularly rich means for 
understanding changes in the information economy.

Appendix – Personal Given Names Over Time 

 
The tables below shows the ten most popular given male names about London c. 1120 to 
1994, and the ten most popular female names in North England (Yorkshire, Cumbria, 
Northumberland) c. 1350 to 1994.  The years given are approximate birth years.  The 
average year of birth was estimated relative to the date of the compilation and the 
probable ages of the persons in the compilation.  The data come from a variety of 
sources, which have used different (and often not explicit described) approaches to 
standardizing and grouping names.   
 
Scholars interested in additional name lists should consult Smith-Bannister (1997), 
Appendix C. That appendix lists, at decade intervals, the fifty most popular male and 
female names in forty English parishes from 1538-49 to 1690-1700.  Unfortunately, the 
frequency of specific names are not given, nor are sample sizes.  The weights given to 
individual parishes in each decade sample apparently change, but details are not given.

Sources and Notes: 
 
The list for 1120 was compiled from the Winton Doomesday book for the year 1148.  
The list is given in Barlow et al. (1976), Table 8, p. 187.  No details are provided 
regarding any name standardization done.   
 
The list for 1260 was compiled from the London Subsidy Rolls of 1292.  The list is given 
in Ekwall (1951) p. 35.  Variants included under the given name heading are as follows: 
John (Jon), Walter (Water), and Henry (Hanry, Hary, Herri).   
 
The list for 1510 was compiled from baptismal names in five London parishes, 1540-
1549.  The parishes are: St. Peter’s upon Cornhill; St. De’nis Backchurch; Christ Church 
Newgate; Kensington; St. Antholin, Budge Row.  All baptismal names, as recorded in 
Harleian Society Publications, were included in the compilation.  The list is given in 
Stewart (1948), Table 1, p. 110.  The source notes: “I have tried to ignore mere variations 
of spelling, but to count separately the different forms of  the same name, such as Henry 
and Harry, Augustine and Austin. … Spellings have been normalized to conform with 
those of the King James Bible, or with modern usage for non-Biblical names.”  See 
Stewart (1948), footnote pp. 109-10. 
 
The list for 1610 was compiled on the same basis as the 1510 list, but for the years 1640-
1649.  See Stewart (1948) Table 2, p. 112. 
 
The 1825 list is from persons born between 1819 and 1830 in London, and still alive and 
recorded in the U.K. Census of 1881.   The complete Census of 1881 is available from 
the Genealogical Society of Utah (1997).  Names given in the Census were standardized 
using GINAP v. 1.0 name standardization, available at 
http://users.erols.com/dgalbi/names/ginap.htm.   
 
The list for 1994 includes all males born in Greater London in 1994 who registered with 
the National Health Service Central Register. See Merry (1995), Table 21.  The source 
lists the top 50 names. From that compilation, the list given above groups Jamie with 
James and Jake with Jack.

Sources and Notes: 
 
The list for 1350 is from the assessment roll of the 1379 Poll Tax for Howdenshire 
Hundred in Yorkshire East Riding.  See Gwynek (n.d.).  The names were listed in 
Latinized forms in the ablative case.  Variants and dimunitives were combined as 
follows: Alicia (Alisia, 1), Agnete (Augnete, 1; Annya, 1), Emma (Emmota, 7), 
Margareta (Mergareeta, 1; Marg, 1; Marg…, 1; Mar’, 1; Magota, 6), Cecilia (Cicilia, 19; 
Sissota, 3; Syssota, 1). 
 
The sources for 1530, 1640, and 1730 are from parish marriage registers in 
Northumberland and Durham for the years 1538-68, 1650-70, and 1740-60, respectively.  
For complete standardized given name list, see Galbi (2001).  Names were standardized 
using GINAP v. 1.0 name standardization, available at 
http://users.erols.com/dgalbi/names/ginap.htm.

The 1825 list is from persons born between 1819 and 1830 in Cumberland, Durham, and 
Northumberland, and still alive and recorded in the U.K. Census of 1881.   The complete 
Census of 1881 is available from the Genealogical Society of Utah (1997).  Names given 
in the Census were standardized using GINAP v. 1.0 
 
The list for 1994 includes all females born in Cumbria, Durham, Cleveland, Tyne & 
Wear, and Northumberland in 1994 who registered with the National Health Service 
Central Register. See Merry (1995), Table 5.  The source lists the top 50 names. From 
that compilation, the list given above grouped Rachel and Rachael.

3 See the GINAP webpage, http://users.erols.com/dgalbi/names/ginap.htm.  The principle for coding is to 
group together names that either sound the same, have the same public meaning, or changed only in the 
recording process (spelling errors, recording errors, etc.). 
4 Note that name standardization helps to control for changes in names used as a person grows older, e.g. a 
correlation between nicknames or informal names and age.  Thus name standardization is particularly 
important in analyzing time trends when the data come from naming cohorts constructed by age.  That is 
the case for this paper’s data on nineteenth century names.  
5 Clark (1992) pp. 552, 558-562. There is no evidence that Norman clergy or royal officials compelled the 
English to adopt Norman names. 
6 This is true because log(a/b)=log(a)+log(b).  The logarithm of name frequency differs from the logarithm 
of name popularity only by an additive factor.  Name popularity rank and name frequency rank are of 
course identical. 
7 Gabaix (1999) shows that, when the appearance rate for new cities is not too high, it has no effect on the 
slope of the power law describing city sizes.  If the appearance rate for new cities rises above a certain 
threshold, than the slope depends on the appearance rate.  Cities can be analogized to name types.   
8 For population and income statistics for 1700 and earlier, see Mayhew (1995) Table I, and Snooks (1995), 
Table 3.5.  For current population statistics, see UK National Statistics, Key Population and Vital Statistics, 
online at http://www.statistics.gov.uk/statbase/Product.asp?vlnk=539&More=N .  The large changes in the 
structure of the economy over the past two hundred years make estimating changes in per capita income 
subject to significant uncertainty.  The figure of 100 is my estimate based on my knowledge of the 
economic history literature.

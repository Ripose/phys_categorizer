GENERAL PROPERTIES OF OPTICAL HARMONIC GENERATION FROM A SIMPLE
OSCILLATOR MODEL

Scuola Normale Superiore, 56100 Pisa

ABSTRACT

The nonlinear oscillator model allows a basic understanding of all nonlinear processes and can

be adopted to analyse optical vibrational modes and electronic transitions in molecules and crystals, in

order  to  derive  general    properties  of  harmonic  generation  to  all  orders.  In  particular,  we  obtain

Kramers-Krönig  relations  and  sum  rules  referred  to  all  momenta  of  the  susceptibility,  and  Miller’s

empirical rules to all orders. Since the above properties only depend on  time  causality  and  not  on  the

specific  microscopic  model,  they  can  also  be  adopted  for  the  quantum  mechanical  description,

substituting in the classical expressions the derivatives of the potential with their expectation values.

INTRODUCTION

Since  the  advent  of  laser,  nonlinear  optical  effects  have  been  extensively  studied  both

theoretically and experimentally [1]. The possibility of producing particularly high electric fields of very

short duration has recently increased the  interest  in  harmonic  generation  processes  [2].  Since  the  first

detection of second harmonic generation [3], a continuous progress along similar lines has allowed the

detailed investigation of higher harmonics [4]. In the case of atoms, using high power sources, odd order
harmonics as high as the 135th have been obtained [5].

Kramers-Krönig  (K.K.)  relations  and  related  sum  rules  have  been  proved  for  second

harmonics  [6]  and  third  harmonics  [7],  using  the  Kubo  expression  [8]  for  the  response  function.  The

above sum rules have allowed a derivation of Miller’s empirical rules for second harmonic generation

and  the  calculation  of  Miller’s  constant  [9],  using  a  simplified  quantum  mechanical  treatment.    Sum

rules can be in general related to the ground state properties only [10].

The purpose of the present contribution is to obtain similar results for harmonics of any order

by  using  the  classical  anharmonic  oscillator  model  in  the  presence  of  one  external  electric  field  of  a

given  frequency.  Since  the  basic  ingredients  are  the  analytical  properties  of  the  susceptibility

and its 

asymptotic behavior, the results obtained in this way can be interpreted from a

more general point of view.

to all orders.

In section II we describe our model and give (the prescriptions by obtaining) analytical solutions

In  section  III  we  use  the  analytical  properties  and  the  asymptotic  behavior  of  the  nonlinear

susceptibility to derive appropriate Kramers-Krönig (K.K.) relations and sum rules for the momenta of

the susceptibility up to the highest momentum.

orders and how they are interconnected.

In  section  IV  we  show  how  Miller’s  rules  can  be  obtained  for  the  harmonic  generation  to  all

In section V we discuss the application of our general results to ionic and electronic motion.

In section VI we present our conclusions.

We  follow  the  idea  of  the  Lorentz  oscillator  and  consider  a  general  potential  energy    mV(x)

expanded around the equilibrium position of moving charges.

Let the Hamiltonian of the forced oscillator, for simplicity taken in one dimension, be:

The solutions can be obtained by successive iterations, each iterative process giving a higher harmonic.

The procedure requires expressing the solution as a sum of terms of decreasing magnitude:

note that the second one in (9c) is needed to separate the first term in (9a) from teh rest of the terms in

the summation.

4

We can observe that in (9a) only the first term is relevant for the asymptotic behavior, because

all  the  other  contributions  go  to  zero  much  faster  at  infinity.  Furthermore,  in  case  of  inversion

symmetry, only odd order terms of the susceptibilities are different from zero because in the even order

susceptibilities  the  first  term  vanishes  and  the  terms  in  the  summation  also  vanish  since  they  always

contain as a factor at least one odd order derivative of the potential which obviously vanishes.

III.

KRAMERS-KRÖNIG RELATIONS AND SUM RULES

We have proved in all generality that the susceptibilities  χ ω ω ω

) (

..

,

n

(

)

are analytic functions

in the upper complex ω plane, due to time-causality of the general response function [12]. This can be

seen  to  hold  obviously  for  all  preceding  expressions,  the  reason  being  that  time  causality  has  been

essentially introduced in the equation of motion.

As a consequence a number of K.K. relations hold for each harmonic generation process when

the  different  asymptotic  behaviour  is  considered.  All  the  K.K.  relations  for  each  process  can  thus  be

obtained and are the following:

The  number  of  K.K.  relations  for  each  case  depends  on  the  order  of  harmonic  because  the

exponent 2α has to be such that ω α2 χ ω ω

With respect to the linear case, where K.K. relations  have  been  systematically  exploited  [13],

the  K.K.  relations  (10)  have  not  been  extensively  applied.  We  can  notice  that,  of  the  many  relations

obtained, those with lower α values have a very rapid convergence while the highest α values  require

the knowledge of the entire spectrum. For this reason so far only the α = 0 relations have been used. In

the case of third harmonics Hasegawa et al. [14] have shown that the phase of  χ ω ω ω

relations. The other dispersion relations can be of value for analysing and extrapolating all data on high

harmonic generation.

5

With the above dispersion relations (10) and  the  asymptotic  behavior  given  by  (9),  sum  rules

can  be  obtained  by  setting    ω→0  in  expressions  (10)  or  by  considering  their  asymptotic  behavior  as

obtained  from  the  superconvergence  theorem  [12],  [13].  When  such  asymptotic  behavior  is  made  to

agree with that obtained from expression (9) we obtain the following sum rules:

 Higher momenta of the susceptibility than the ones considered above do not give convergence.

As proved in detail for the case of second harmonics and of third harmonics, the validity of the

above described dispersion relations and sum rules extends beyond the simple classical model adopted,

here provided the external potential V(x) of the anharmonic  oscillator  is  substituted  with  the  effective

crystal  potential  for  the  electrons.  It  has  also  been  proved  [6]  [7]  that,  in  the  case  of  the  quantum

mechanical treatment, instead of the derivatives at the equilibrium position their expectation values on

the ground state have to be considered.

When  we  also  consider  the  possibility  of  different  directions  of  the  applied  fields  and  of  the

polarization, we obtain the usual tensorial relations in the sum rules and in the K.K. relations, the type

of tensorial matrices being determined in the usual way by the symmetry of the potential.

The  above  sum  rules  as  the  K.K.  relations  (10)  provide  a  large  number  of  constraints  which

must be obeyed by any theoretical model of harmonic generation processes. Since in most materials the

theoretical ab initio calculations of the susceptibilities are hardly possible, such constraints may be used

to  determine  the  relevant  parameters  inside  a  particular  quantum  model,  as  in  the  case  of  a  single

resonance frequency for  χ ω ω

) (

,

 [6], [7].

The  nonlinear  sum  rules  for  each  specific  case  have  been  used  in  experimental  studies  of  the

optical nonlinear response of atomic cesium vapor [15].

DISCUSSION OF MILLER’S RULES AND FURTHER APPLICATIONS

Miller  proposed  in  1964  an  empirical  rule  connecting  the  second  harmonic  susceptibility

(

2

χ ω ω
) (

,

)

 with the first order susceptibilities  χ ω( ) (

1

)

 [16]. Subsequently Iha and Bloembergen [17]

have extended Miller’s rule to the case of third harmonic generation. Miller’s constant which connects

the  higher  orders  susceptibilities  to  the  first  order  expressions  is  taken  from  experiments  and  is

considered to be independent of frequency as in the oscillator model described above.

In  our  simplified  model  we  obtain  as  an  immediate  byproduct  Miller’s  rules  to  all  orders  of

harmonics generation and can derive the explicit expressions for Miller’s constants, which turn out to be

independent of frequency.

Comparing eq. (7) and eq. (6) we obtain for the second harmonics:

where as usual the derivative is computed at the equilibrium in the classical case and as an average on

the ground state in the quantum treatment. This is in agreement with the result obtained by Garrett and

Robinson [11] and also agrees with the result of Scandolo and Bassani [6].

Our model gives a Miller’s rule also for the third harmonic generation. Using eq. (8) and eq. (6)

The expression for the contribution of the first term in (13b) has been obtained by Scandolo and Rapapa

[7] applying the sum rules on a simplified quantum model with a single resonance, provided the ground

state average is considered.

Similar expressions can be derived for higher orders harmonic generation susceptibilities, as can

be  obtained  from  our  equations  (9)  and  (6).  The  main  term,  which  is  responsible  for  the  asymptotic

behavior is:

  with  i<n.  The  corresponding  constants  are  products  of

derivatives of the potential of order lower than (n+1) with appropriate dimensional coefficients.

Only the dominant term of Miller’s rule (14) is connected with the sum rules because it is the

only term responsible for the asymptotic behavior. In the case of inversion symmetry the  relevance  of

(14a) is even greater since all the other terms with odd derivatives in the potential vanish by symmetry.

From equation (14) and equation (11) we see the connection between Miller’s constant and the

sum rules. That is:

The generality of this result makes it independent of the specific model and allows a connection

between the highest momentum of the susceptibilities and Miller’s constant, which thus turns out to give

a measure of the strength of the nonlinearity.

V.

IONIC AND ELECTRONIC NONLINEAR EFFECTS

The practical application of the oscillator model to physically relevant problems, in the case of

polar materials,  requires considering both electronic resonances and ionic vibrations.

As a first approximation we can separate the electronic and ionic motions, considering the fact

that their resonance frequencies are well separated (in the far infrared for the vibrational modes and in

8

the visible range for the electronic resonances). In this case also the susceptibilities can be separated in

two  similar  contributions,  χ

n(

) (

ω ω ω

..

,

)   and  χ

n(

) (

ω ω ω

..

,

) ,  each  one  related  only  to  its  own

e

i

parameters  (charge,  mass,  density)  and  to  its  own  potential.  Consequently  we  obtain  two  sets  of

dispersion relations and sum rules of the type (10) and (11), one for the electronic contribution and the

other for the ionic contribution, where in the latter case we use the ionic charge Q and the ionic mass M,

CONCLUSIONS

We may summarize the results of the present work as follows.

Susceptibilities of harmonic generation processes to all  orders  have  been  obtained  in  terms  of

the anharmonicity in the potential. Every harmonic susceptibility can be expressed in terms of the lower

ones, so that by induction we can say it is possible to find an explicit expression of the susceptibilities

as sums of products of first order susceptibilities, which is the essence of Miller’s rules.

A different number of K.K. relations is obtained for each order of susceptibilitiy, as determined

by the asymptotic behavior.

Sum rules on the momenta of the susceptibility have been obtained, the highest momentum only,

the (2n+1)th momentum of the imaginary part, being different from zero.

The  role  of  ionic  and  electronic  coupling  has  been  established,  and  expressions  are  given  in

terms of the softness of the material.

While  the  explicit  expressions  of  the  susceptibility  are  model  dependent,  the  general  results

obtained  concerning  K.K.  relations,  sum  rules  and  Miller’s  rules  have  a  more  general  validity,  as

already proved for the case of second and third harmonic generation. We hope that the above results will

be of practical use, as necessary constraints of any model, needed in the experimental development of

high harmonics generation.

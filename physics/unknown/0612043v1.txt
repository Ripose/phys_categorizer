N.I. Yannopoulou, P.E. Zimourtopoulos and E.T. Sarris 

The wide band of frequencies that includes all those allocated to 2G/3G applications 

was defined as 2G/3G band and the discone antenna with a structure of radial wires 

was defined as radial discone. This antenna was theoretically analysed and software 

simulated with the purpose of computationally design a broadband model of it. As an 

application, a radial discone for operation from 800 to 3000 MHz, which include the 

2G/3G band, was designed and an experimental model was built and tested. Mathe-

matically expressed measurement error bounds were computed in order to evaluate 

the agreement between theory and practice. 

Introduction:  Kandoian  invented  the  well-known  discone  antenna  in  1945  [1].  Nail 

gave  two  simple  relations  for  discone  dimensions  in  1953  [2].  Rappaport  designed 

discones using an N-type connector feed in 1987 [3]. Cooke studied a discone with a 

structure of radial wires in 1993 [4]. Kim et al. recently presented a double radial dis-

cone antenna for UWB applications [5]. This Letter proposes a broadband radial dis-

cone fed by an N-type connector for operation from 800 to 3000 MHz that includes all 

frequencies allocated to 2G/3G applications. 

Analysis, Simulation, Design, Application and Measurements: The radial discone was 

theoretically analysed as a group of identical filamentary V-dipoles with unequal arms 

connected  in  parallel.  The  dipoles  recline  on  equiangular  vertical  phi-planes  around 

z-axis to form a disc-conical array. Fig. 1-A shows two coplanar dipoles conformed to 

the apex angle (a). Each dipole has a total length L equal to the sum of arm lengths r 

and s and the gap between its terminals g.

The  simulation  was  based  on  a  suite  of  developed  visual  tools  supported  by  a  fully 

analysed,  corrected  and  redeveloped  edition  of  the  original  thin-wire  computer  pro-

gram by Richmond [6]. 

A  visual  program  was  specifically  developed  to  design  a  broadband  radial  discone 

with bare wires of diameter d embedded in free space when the wire conductivity, the 

type of feeding connector and the frequency band are given. Two arithmetic criteria 

were adopted for the broadband characterisation of a model: VSWR lower than 2 and 

normalized radiation intensity U/Umax lower than 3 dB on horizontal plane. The pro-

gram uses the model of a radial discone fed by an N-type connector shown in Fig. 1-

B. Starting with an appropriate combination of the relations given by [2]-[4] the pro-

gram  computes  by  iteration  in  terms  of  wavelength λ,  the  characteristics  r,  s,  g,  (a) 

and  d  of  a  broadband  model,  just  when  the  criteria  are  satisfied.  Fig.  1-C  shows  a 

ground plane antenna consists of the same cone radials and a vertical monopole with 

height r, which was designed for reference. 

As a practical application of the broadband design, the 2G/3G band from 800 to 2500 

MHz  was  selected  to  begin  with  and  an  experimental  radial  discone  of  copper  wire 

fed by N-type connector was built, as shown in Fig. 1-D. In order to demonstrate the 

particular  behaviour  of  the  experimental  model,  the  2G/3G  band  was  divided  in  six 

sub-bands  I:  806-960  MHz,  II:  1429-1513  MHz,  III:  1710-1900  MHz,  IV:  1910-2025 

MHz, V: 2110-2170 MHz and VI: 2400-2499 MHz. 

Our measurement system consists of an EM anechoic chamber, a network analyser, 

a number of support instruments, a set of standard loads of factory accuracy and a 

constructed antenna rotation mechanism with a built hardware control unit of its step 

motor.  The  combined  characteristics  of  system  parts  specify  a  measurement  band 

from 600 to 1300 MHz, which overlaps with the 2G/3G band. Developed control soft-

ware synchronises the system and collects data using the IEEE-488 protocol. A de-

veloped  general  mathematical  method  expresses  the  measurement  error  bounds. 

Another  set  of  developed  software  applications  processes  the  collected  data  and 

computes the error bounds. 

 

Results: The consideration of radial discone as an array of at least 8 V-dipoles pro-

duces a theta-polarised vector radiation pattern with magnitude a surface almost by 

revolution  around  z-axis.  So  the  radial  discone  has  indeed  on  horizontal  plane  xOy 

the  basic  properties  of  a  vertically  polarised  almost  omni-directional  antenna,  a  fact 

that encouraged design of a broadband model by simulation. 

The application of the broadband criteria to 2G/3G band resulted to the design of a 

radial discone with r = 44 mm, g = 6 mm, s = 125 mm, d = 1.5 mm and a = 60° that 

operates from 800 to 3000 MHz, which exceeds that of 2G/3G band. The accordingly 

built experimental radial discone of Fig. 1-D should be implied with a constructional 

tolerance of ±0.5 mm and ±0.5°. 

The  broadband  model  has  a  directivity  from  about  -0.5  to  2.9  dBd  with  slope  angle 

between -65° and +58°, but the directivity gain on horizontal plane stays very close to 

the desirable value of 0 dBi, since it changes from -1 to +1.7 dBi only. Fig. 2 shows 

that  the  predicted  horizontal  normalised  radiation  intensity  remains  below  3  dB  in-

deed,  while  it  stays  above  0  dB  relative  to  the  reference  antenna  in  all  2G/3G  sub-

bands indicated by the vertical grey strips, when both are fed by the same 50-Ohm 

source.

Fig. 3 shows the predicted normalized radiation patterns in dB at the centre of each 

sub-band, which confirms the horizontal omni-directional radiation properties of the 

broadband model.

At  950  MHz,  the  centre  frequency  of  the  measurement  band,  the  predicted  and 

measured  radiation  intensity  on  the  three  main  cuts  of  the  radiation  pattern  are  in 

good agreement, as shown in Fig. 4.

This is made clearer by the measurement error bounds on a vertical plane, as shown 

in Fig. 5.

Fig. 6 shows that the 50-Ohm VSWR predicted results for the broadband discone are 

below 2 indeed and almost covered by the error bounds in the measurement band. 

Therefore, prediction and experimentation in the measurement band proposes a suc-

cessfully designed broadband radial discone antenna for operation from 800 to 3000

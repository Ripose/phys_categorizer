The logistic differential equation is used to analyze cancer cell population, in the presence of a correlated
Gaussian white noise. We study the steady state properties of tumor cell growth and discuss the effects of the
correlated noise. It is found that the degree of correlation of the noise can cause tumor cell extinction.

I. INTRODUCTION

radiotherapy, restrain the number of tumor cells, giving rise
to a negative additive noise. As a result, we obtain

Recently, nonlinear stochastic systems with noise terms
have attracted extensive investigations and the concept of
noise-induced transition has got wide applications in the ﬁeld
of physics, chemistry, and biology @1,2#. Usually, in these
systems the noise affects the dynamics through a system
variable, i.e., the noise is both multiplicative and additive
@3#. The focal theme of these investigations is to study the
steady state properties of systems in which ﬂuctuations, gen-
erally applied from outside, are considered independent of
the system’s characteristic dissipation. Since the two types of
ﬂuctuations have a common origin, they are correlated in the
relevant time scale of the problem @4#. On the level of a
Langevin-type description of a dynamical system, the pres-
ence of correlation between noises can change the dynamics
of the system @5,6#. Correlated noise processes have found
applications in a broad range of studies such as steady state
properties of a single mode laser @7#, bistable kinetics @8#,
directed motion in spatially symmetric periodic potentials
@9#, stochastic resonance in linear systems @10#, and steady
state entropy production @11#. In this paper we study a tumor
cell growth model in the presence of correlated additive and
multiplicative noise and show how noise correlation can dy-
namically cause tumor cell extinction.

II. THE TUMOR CELL GROWTH MODEL

The logistic growth model has been used in many cases as
a basic model of both cell growth and, more particularly,
tumor cell growth @12,13#. Here, we only consider tumor cell
growth. The logistic differential equation is shown,

where e(t) and G(t) are Gaussian white noises with the fol-
lowing properties:

^G~t !G~t8!&52ad~t2t8!,

where a and D are the strengths of the two noises and l
denotes the degree of correlation between e(t) and G(t) with
0<l,1.

III. STEADY STATE ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

Since the cell number ~x! cannot be negative, we can de-
rive the Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of steady
probability distribution function ~SPDF! corresponding to
Eq. ~2! under the constraint x>0. The equation is @14#

where x is the tumor mass, a the growth rate, and b the cell
decay rate. We consider effects due to some external factors
such as temperature, drugs, radiotherapy, etc. These factors
can inﬂuence the tumor mass directly as well as alter the
tumor growth rate. In other words, the ﬂuctuation of these
factors affects the parameter a generating multiplicative
noise and, at the same time, some factors, such as drugs and

If l50 the last term of the Eq. ~14! vanishes and we have

In fact, for zero correlation, the additive noise has no effect
on the position of the extrema of SPDF which are x50 and
x5(a2D)/b.

In Figs. 1 and 2, we show the effect of the correlation
parameter l on the steady state probability distribution
~SPD!. As the value of l increases, P st(x) increases at small
x, and decreases at large x. Since x denotes the tumor cell
population, it is clear that increasing l tumor cell population
disappears. In other words, the distribution of cell population
which was mainly peaked about zero ~for a large value of l)

signifying high extinction rates, moves toward zero with the
increase of the correlation parameter l.

Figures 3 and 4 show the effect of the strength of noise
e(t) and G(t) on the SPDF. When the degree of correlation
of noises and the strength of the multiplicative noises are
ﬁxed, as the additive noise intensity ais increased, the maxi-
mum value on small value of x increases and the maximum
value on large value of x decreases ~see Fig. 3!. The peak
gets ﬂattened and almost vanishes for a large enough value
of a, indicating that the additive noise is a diffusive term.
The position of the extrema of the SPDF is weakly affected
by the strength aof the additive noise. A different curve was
represented when l and a are ﬁxed and we change the mul-
tiplicative noise intensity D ~see Fig. 4!. As D is increased,
the maximum of SPD moves from a large value of x to small

values of x, showing that the multiplicative noise is a drift
term, which denotes that the multiplicative noise can push
the system cell toward extinction. In other word, intensive
ﬂuctuation of the growth rate may cause tumor extinction.

IV. CONCLUSIONS

In summary, we have studied the effects of environmental
ﬂuctuations on tumor cell growth and its steady state prop-
erties. For large values of l the distribution of cell popula-
tion is peaked at x50, which denotes a high extinction rate.
The additive noise is a diffusive factor, while the multiplica-
tive noise gives a drift factor in the process. It is found that
environmental intensive ﬂuctuations may cause tumor cell
extinction.

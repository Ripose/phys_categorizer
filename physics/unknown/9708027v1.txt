Abstract

The study concerns a special symbolic calculus of interest for signal analysis. This cal-
culus associates functions on the time-frequency half-plane f > 0 with linear operators
deﬁned on the positive-frequency signals. Full attention is given to its construction which
is entirely based on the study of the aﬃne group in a simple and direct way. The correspon-
dence rule is detailed and the associated Wigner function is given. Formulas expressing
the basic operations of the Lie algebra of symbols, which is isomorphic to that of the
operators, are obtained. The calculus is shown to be a very special member of a large
family which is brieﬂy described.

Introduction

The notion of time-frequency analysis of signals received a theoretical basis when D.Gabor
[1] proposed to interpret signals by operations very similar to those of quantum mechanics.
In this approach, the real signals are replaced by their positive-frequency parts (the ”an-
alytic” signals) and the communication characteristics are introduced as the mean values
of hermitian operators deﬁned on the corresponding Hilbert space. Actually, the analogy
with quantum mechanics has rapidly suggested to recognize the time and the frequency
as two conjugate variables and has led to look for a phase space formulation of the theory.
Various solutions have then been proposed which were essentially adaptations of solutions
developed precedently in the quantum mechanical context.

From a mathematical point of view, the question of the phase space formulation of a
quantum theory appears as a problem of symbolic calculus since each operator of the theory
has to be replaced by a function (its symbol) of the phase space variables. The construction
of such a correspondence rule is determined by the class of operators to symbolize and by
subsidiary constraints relative to the physical interpretation of the formalism. In signal
theory, this last point concerns simply the formal invariance of the operations in changes
of reference clocks. The corresponding constraint will be automatically ensured if the
correspondence rule is covariant with respect to relevant representations of the aﬃne group.
The object of the following developments is to construct a symbolic calculus on the time-
frequency half-plane along these lines.

Section 2 gives a study of the aﬃne group and its subgroups, their representations
in the Hilbert space H of signals and their actions in the time-frequency half-plane Γ.
Decompositions of H and Γ into invariant subspaces are carried out in parallel and shown
to be related in a natural way. The correspondence rule is derived in Section 3 by exploiting
the completeness of the invariant decompositions just performed. Some properties of this
rule are given in Section 4 and the associated Wigner function is determined. Section
5 is devoted to the derivation of the star product, which allows to symbolize products
In Section 6, the star bracket is
of operators and is the core of the symbolic calculus.
introduced and shown to reduce to an ordinary Poisson bracket in some special cases. As
an application of this remark, a hamiltonian ﬂow is deﬁned in phase space. Finally, it
is shown in Section 7 that the method has possible extensions when working with larger
groups containing the aﬃne group.

2 The aﬃne group in signal theory

The signals to be considered are real-valued functions of time s(t) which are interpreted
independently of the choice of time origin and units. This means that the description of
the signal processing operations must not change if time t is replaced by at + b where b is
real and a positive. The corresponding change on the signal can be readily written down.
Notice that there is the freedom of rescaling the signal when the units are changed. The
transformations on the signal that will be considered are written as:

where r is a real exponent.

composition law expressed by:

The set of transformations (2.1) forms the aﬃne group, with parameters (a, b) and

s(t) −→ ar s(a−1(t − b))

(a, b)(a′, b′) = (aa′, b + ab′)

The group structure is the mathematical expression of the equivalence of the reference
clocks. To stress the fact that only positive dilations are considered, the parameter u such
that:

a = eu

will be used instead of a.

2.1 Representation in the Hilbert space of positive-frequency signals

The Fourier transform of the signal s(t) will be introduced by:

Since s(t) is a real-valued function, it is characterized by its positive frequency part only. In
agreement with the usual practice in signal theory, this property will be used to substitute
to s(t) the so-called analytic signal whose Fourier transform is given by:

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

(2.4)

(2.5)

ˆs(f ) ≡

s(t)e−2iπf t dt

ZIR

S(f ) = 2 Y (f )ˆs(f )

2

where Y (f ) is Heaviside’s step function.

The counterpart of transformation (2.1) for the analytic signal S(f ) is easily obtained.
Namely, by action of an element (u, b) of the aﬃne group, signal S(f ) goes to a new
function [U(u, b)S](f ) deﬁned by:

(2.6)
The operators U(u, b) constitute an irreducible representation of the aﬃne group that

U(u, b)S(f ) ≡ e(r+1)u e−2iπf b S(euf ),

r ∈ IR

is unitary for the scalar product deﬁned by

(S, S′) ≡

S(f )S′∗(f ) f 2r+1 df

(2.7)

ZIR+

The Hilbert space of functions S(f ) on the half-line which are square integrable for
the measure f 2r+1 df will be denoted by H (the reference to r being implicit). From a
physical point of view, it may be necessary to distinguish between signals transforming
according to (2.6) with diﬀerent values of r. However, the corresponding representations
are easily shown to be unitarily equivalent. In fact, it may be shown that the aﬃne group
has only two inequivalent unitary representations diﬀering by the sign of the imaginary
exponential in (2.6) [2].

The inﬁnitesimal operators of representation (2.6) are introduced by the relations:

The operators β and f thus obtained verify the commutation relation:

The subgroups of the aﬃne group and their representations will now be studied in detail.
There are two kinds of subgroups consisting either of pure dilations or of pure translations.
The translation subgroup is invariant by conjugation. On the contrary, since a dilation
can be performed from an arbitrary time origin ξ, there is a whole family of conjugate
dilation subgroups Gξ which consist of the following set of elements:

The restriction Uξ of representation (2.6) to Gξ is given by

Gξ = {(eu, ξ(1 − eu))}

Uξ(u)S(f ) = e(r+1)u e−2iπf ξ(1−eu)S(euf )

where operators β and f are given by (2.8) and (2.9) respectively.

The operator of representation (2.12) can be written in terms of generator βξ as:

Uξ = e−2iπuβξ

For a given ξ, the eigenfunctions of the self-adjoint operator βξ are deﬁned by the

equation

β(f ),
whose solution is, up to a multiplicative constant:

β(f ) = βψξ

β ∈ IR

and verify

β(f ) are also eigenfunctions of the unitary operator (2.14)

β(f ) = e−2iπβu ψξ

For a given ξ, functions (2.16) constitute an improper basis of the Hilbert space H. In
fact, one veriﬁes that there is orthogonality of the functions corresponding to diﬀerent β

(ψξ

β(f ), ψξ

β′(f )) = δ(β − β′)

where the scalar product has the form (2.7). The completeness of this basis is expressed
by:

β(f )ψξ∗
ψξ

β (f ′) dβ = f −2r−1 δ(f − f ′)

ZIR

For each ξ, the set of all the projectors on the functions ψξ
β(f ) gives a decomposition of
the Hilbert space H. From (2.17) it results that each of these projectors is invariant by
the transformations of the subgroup Gξ.

More generally, the action of the whole aﬃne group on functions ψξ

β(f ) is given by:

U(u, b)ψξ

β (f ) = e−2iπuβ ψξ′

β (f )

with ξ′ = euξ + b. This shows that the set of projectors associated with subgroup Gξ is
transformed as a whole into the set of projectors associated with subgroup Geuξ+b. In
other words, this means that the set of all decompositions of H by the various subgroups
Gξ is invariant by action of the whole group.

2.2 Action of the group in the time-frequency half-plane

The physical phase space for signal analysis is the time-frequency half-plane, Γ = {(t, f )},
t real, f > 0. This space can also be obtained as an orbit of the coadjoint representation
of the aﬃne group whose action in variables (t, f ) is given by:

(u, b) :

(t, f ) −→ (eut + b, e−uf )

(2.21)

where the pair (u, b) characterizes an element of the group.

This action induces a transformation on functions A(t, f ) deﬁned on Γ. This transfor-

mation has the form:

(u, b) : A(t, f ) −→ A(e−u(t − b), euf )

(2.22)

4

According to deﬁnition (2.11), the restriction of representation (2.21) to subgroup Gξ
reads:

(t, f ) −→ (eut + ξ(1 − eu), e−uf )

and the corresponding transformation of phase space functions is given by:

(2.23)

(2.24)

(2.25)

(2.26)

(2.28)

(2.29)

A(t, f ) −→ A(e−u(t − ξ) + ξ, euf )

The transformation (2.23) has the following invariant:

(t − ξ)f = ˜β,

˜β ∈ IR

where ˜β is an arbitrary constant. For each ξ, this relation deﬁnes a family of curves in
phase space labelled by ˜β. Actually any point in Γ belongs to one, and only one, of these
curves and a partition of phase space has thus been achieved for any value of ξ.
Uniform distributions on curves (2.25) are given by the Dirac distributions:

δξ
β ≡ δ((t − ξ)f − ˜β)

These distributions are invariant by action of the subgroup Gξ and transform under the
full group as follows:

(u, b) : δξ
˜β

= δ((t − ξ)f − ˜β) −→ δ((e−u(t − b) − ξ)euf − ˜β) = δξeu+b

(2.27)

˜β

This result can be compared with (2.20). In fact, the full group connects the various phase
space partitions associated with subgroups Gξ.

2.3 Correspondence between invariant structures

The subgroup Gξ, considered for any given value of ξ, has allowed to perform decompo-
sitions of both H and Γ where the resulting partitions have been labelled by parameters
denoted respectively by β and ˜β. We will now show that a natural connection does exist
between these two parameters. To develop this point, it is useful to introduce the notion
of localized signals in a consistent way.

A signal St0(f ) ∈ H is said to be localized at time t0 provided an aﬃne transformation,
deﬁned by the element (u, b) of the aﬃne group, sends it into a signal localized at (eut0 +b).
This is expressed by the following equation:

U(u, b)St0 (f ) ≡ e(r+1)u e−2iπf b St0(euf ) = Seut0+b(f )

whose solution is, up to a multiplicative constant:

St0(f ) = f −r−1 e−2iπf t0

Notice the factor f −r−1 which is required by dilation invariance. In this way, the whole
set of localized states St0 is stable by action of the aﬃne group.

In the decomposition of H relative to the subgroup Gξ, the β-subspace is generated
β(f ) of the form (2.16). Developing the phase of this function in the vicinity of a

by ψξ
frequency f0 leads to the approximate expression:

ψξ
β(f ) ≃ e−2iπβ(ln f0−1) f −r−1 e−2iπf (β/f0+ξ)

(2.30)

5

A comparison with (2.29) shows that, apart from a constant phase, the approximated
function can be seen as a state localized at:

t0 = β/f0 + ξ

˜β = β

(2.31)

(2.32)

(3.1)

(3.2)

Thus, in a local study of functions (2.16), it is possible to associate with any frequency f
a time t given by t = β/f + ξ. This relation deﬁnes precisely an orbit of subgroup Gξ in
phase space Γ (cf.(2.25)). It leads naturally to identify the parameters of the connected
elements by setting:

This identiﬁcation, which is clearly invariant under the group action, will play a central
role in the following construction.

3 Geometric correspondence between symbols and opera-

tors

The aim now is to set up a correspondence between operators on the Hilbert space H
and functions (their symbols) on the time-frequency half-plane Γ. The approach will be
essentially based on the parallel decompositions of H and Γ introduced in the preceding
section. The derived correspondence will be said to be geometric to emphasize the fact
that it is essentially grounded on the study of the group and its invariants.

3.1 Characterization of operators by their diagonal elements in the var-

ious ξ-bases

Consider an operator A deﬁned by a kernel according to:

[AS](f1) =

A(f1, f2)S(f2)f 2r+1

df2

Its diagonal matrix elements on the Gξ-invariant basis deﬁned by (2.16) are given by:

β (f1)A(f1, f2)ψξ

Quantities IH(ξ, β) have several properties that will be detailed below. First, for
any given value of ξ and β, they are invariant by action of the representation U ξ on
the operator A. Moreover, the operator A can be recovered from the values of IH(ξ, β)
(−∞ < ξ < ∞, −∞ < β < ∞) and a simple formula exists for the trace of operators. To
be able to discriminate between functions IH(ξ, β) associated with distinct operators, we
will also use the notation IH(A; ξ, β) for (3.2).

the last equality being a consequence of property (2.17).

Aﬃne covariance

The action of the full group on IH(ξ, β) is computed in the same way, using property
(2.20). One obtains:

IH(A′; ξ, β) = IH(A; euξ + b, β)

(3.3)

where A′ = U−1(u, b)AU(u, b).
This relation expresses the diagonal elements of A′ in the ξ-basis in terms of the
diagonal elements of A in the basis corresponding to the subgroup Gξ′, conjugate of
Gξ by the transformation (u, b) of the aﬃne group.

Reconstruction of the operator A

Deﬁning the two-dimensional Fourier transform of IH(ξ, β) by

IH(u, v) ≡

e−2iπ(uξ+vβ)IH(ξ, β) dξdβ

(3.4)

we can compute it from (3.2) and ﬁnd

The inversion of this relation can be done directly by changing the variables. The

3.2 Characterization of symbols by their line integrals on ξ-orbits

b

The description of functions A(t, f ) deﬁned on phase space Γ can be carried out in a way
which parallels that followed for the operators. The starting point is the association of a
function IΓ(ξ, β) with each phase space function A(t, f ) by the relation:

IΓ(ξ, β) ≡

A(t, f )δ((t − ξ)f − β) dtdf

(3.9)

ZΓ

7

For a given ξ, the function deﬁned by (3.9) is interpreted as the integral of A(t, f ) on the
various orbits of the subgroup Gξ. The study of the properties of function IΓ(ξ, β) follows
the same steps as in Section 3.1. For practical reasons, the notation IΓ(A; ξ, β) will also
be used for expression (3.9).

Gξ-invariance of IΓ(ξ, β)

Aﬃne covariance

The integral in (3.9) is clearly invariant under the action of Gξ on A(t, f ) deﬁned
by (2.24).

When A(t, f ) is transformed into A′(t, f ) ≡ A(eut+b, a−1f ), the function IΓ(A; ξ, β)
becomes:

IΓ(A′; ξ, β) = IΓ(A; euξ + b, β)
This relation connects the integrals of the function A′ on the Gξ orbits to the integrals
of A on the orbits of the subgroup Gξ′, conjugate of Gξ by the transformation (u, b)
of the aﬃne group.

(3.10)

Reconstruction of the function A(t, f )

Relation (3.9) deﬁnes in fact the Radon transform of A(t, f ) with respect to arrays
of hyperbolas parametrized by ξ and β. To invert this transform, we introduce the
two-dimensional Fourier transform of IΓ(ξ, β) in a manner analogous to (3.4) and
compute

3.3 The geometric correspondence rule

b

So far, operators on the Hilbert space H and functions on the phase space Γ have been
characterized respectively by functions IH(ξ, β) or IΓ(ξ, β). Moreover, for each value of ξ,
both functions IH(ξ, β) and IΓ(ξ, β) are invariant by action of the subgroup Gξ. Thus it
is possible to deﬁne the correspondence between operators and symbols by requiring that

IH(ξ, β) ≡ IΓ(ξ, β)

(3.14)

and to denote the common function by I(ξ, β). This correspondence is stable by the aﬃne
group as seen from properties (3.3) and (3.10). Actually, the consistency with the group

8

action implies only the proportionality of the two members of (3.14). The interest of the
strict identiﬁcation which has been adopted is to ensure that the identity operator will be
symbolized by the function one.

According to (3.5) and (3.11), the Fourier transform of relation (3.14) leads to:

I(u, v) = A

The explicit formulas for the correspondence between functions and operators follow im-
mediately. Moreover, the unitarity property of the correspondence becomes obvious from
the comparison of (3.8) and (3.13). The result can be formulated under the following form:

Result 3.1 The kernel of the operator corresponding to the function A(t, f ), deﬁned on
the time-frequency half-plane Γ, is given by:

Remark 3.1 Substitution of the identity operator with kernel
I(f1, f2) = (f1f2)−r−1/2 δ(f1 − f2)

in rule (3.16) leads to the symbol

I(t, f ) = 1

Remark 3.2 From expression (3.16), it is clear that operators A whose matrix elements
have the hermitian symmetry:

are in correspondence with real-valued functions A(t, f ).

A(f1, f2) = A∗(f2, f1)

Remark 3.3 The above correspondence has been established between kernels A(f1, f2),
deﬁned for f1, f2 positive, and symbols A(t, f ) deﬁned on the time-frequency half-plane
f > 0. An extension of the rule can be performed if a function A(t, f ) deﬁned on the whole
plane is substituted in (3.15) and if negative values for f1 and f2 are allowed. However,
the result will be a function A(f1, f2) deﬁned only in the ﬁrst and third quadrant of the
(f1, f2) plane. The regions where f1 and f2 have diﬀerent signs are deﬁnitely forbidden in
the geometric correspondence.

4 Some special cases

4.1 Symbol of the projector on a β-subspace of H
The β-subspace associated with subgroup Gξ is characterized by the function ψξ
troduced in (2.16). The projector on this subspace is the linear operator deﬁned by:

β(f ) in-

S(f ) −→ (ψξ

β, S) ψξ

β(f )

β(f1, f2) = ψξ
Πξ

β(f1)ψξ∗

β (f2)

where the scalar product has the form (2.7). The corresponding kernel is given by (cf.
(3.1):

A direct application of formula (3.16) shows that the symbols associated with (4.2) is the
distribution δ((t − ξ)f − β) with support in Γ localized on the β-orbit of subgroup Gξ.

4.2 Aﬃne Wigner function as a particular symbol

Each signal S(f ) deﬁnes a real linear functional on the set of hermitian operators by:

where the scalar product is given by (2.7).
This functional can also be written as:

< A >= (AS, S) = (S, AS)

< A >= Tr (ΠS A)

ΠS(f1, f2) = S(f1)S∗(f2)

where the trace operation has been deﬁned by (3.7) and where ΠS is the projector on
signal S(f ) with kernel given by:

(4.1)

(4.2)

(4.3)

(4.4)

(4.5)

From the reciprocal correspondence (3.15), (3.16) and from Remark 3.2, it results that
each real linear functional on the set of hermitian operators can be expressed as a real
linear functional of the real-valued functions on the time-frequency half-plane. The Wigner
function for the signal S(f ) is deﬁned as the function (or distribution) P(t, f ) on the time-
frequency half-plane which allows to rewrite (4.4) in the form:

< A >=

P(t, f )A(t, f ) dtdf

(4.6)

ZΓ

where A(t, f ) is the symbol of operator A. From this deﬁnition, it is clear that the form of
the Wigner function is fundamentally dependent of the symbolic calculus which is adopted.
The equality of the right-hand sides of (4.4) and (4.6) gives a relation of type (3.17)
(unitarity property) provided the Wigner function P(t, f ) is identiﬁed with the geometric
symbol of the projector ΠS. This makes it possible to obtain the relevant Wigner function
by applying the correspondence rule (3.16) to the kernel (4.5). The result is the aﬃne
Wigner function [3]:

Expression (4.7) can also be obtained directly by writing the unitarity relation (3.17)
with one symbol equal to P(t, f ) and the other one equal to the localized distribution
δ(t − t0) δ(f − f0). This leads to the relation:

P(t0, f0) = Tr (ΠS∆t0,f0)

where ∆t0,f0 is the operator with symbol δ(t − t0) δ(f − f0). The kernel of this operator
is given by (3.15) and reads:

∆(f1, f2) = (f1f2)−r−1 f1 − f2
ln f1/f2

Function P(t, f ) can then be obtained by (4.8). These results are summarized by:

Result 4.1 The Wigner function of signal S(f ) associated with the geometric correspon-
dence is given by (4.7). It can be obtained either as the symbol of the projector ΠS on signal
S(f ), or as the mean value (4.8) of the operator ∆t0,f0 whose symbol is δ(t − t0)δ(f − f0).

The unitarity property (3.17) gives directly the formulas:

where P1 and P2 stand for the Wigner functions corresponding to S1 and S2 respectively.
Many other properties could be mentioned which are related to the interpretation of

the Wigner function as a time-frequency representation [4], [5].

4.3 Exponentials of generators and Weyl’s formulation of the correspon-

dence

We will now show that the symbol of the operator Eu0v0 ≡ e−2iπ(u0β+v0f), where β and
f are the generators deﬁned by (2.8) and (2.9), is given by the function Eu0v0 (t, f ) =
e−2iπ(u0tf +v0f ).

It follows from the developments of Section 2.1 that the operator Eu0v0 satisﬁes the

following eigenvalue equation:

e−2iπ(u0β+v0f)ψ−v0/u0

(f ) = e−2iπβu0ψ−v0/u0

The kernel of Eu0v0 is obtained directly from the spectral decomposition:

2

(4.13)

Substituting this result in (3.16), we can write the symbol of Eu0v0 as:

Eu0v0(t, f ) =

e2iπvf t e(r+1)u0 exp{−2iπ(f (v0/u0)(eu0 − 1)λ(v))}

Since

λ(v) =

2 sinh(v/2)

δ(eu0 λ(v) − λ(−v)) =

λ(u0)

the result of integration in (4.14) is just:

Eu0v0(t, f ) = e−2iπ(u0f t+v0f )

Thus, we have established the correspondence

Eu0v0(t, f ) ≡ e−2iπ(u0f t+v0f ) ←→ Eu0v0 = e−2iπ(u0β+v0f)

(4.18)

Remark that the variable β = tf rather than t appears naturally. It will sometimes be
convenient to use it by performing the change of variables according to:

˜A(β, f ) = [A(t, f )]t=β/f

The correspondence (4.18) allows to write the operator A in terms of its symbol A(t, f )

by the formula:

A =

A(u, v) e−2iπ(uβ+vf) dudv

A(u, v) is the Fourier transform of ˜A(β, f ) given by:

The correspondence between functions and operators deﬁned by (4.20) and (4.21) has
a form analogous to Weyl’s. In fact, it is what L.Cohen calls Weyls’rule for operators β
and f [6]. It can also be obtained as a by-product of Kirillov’s analysis [7] as shown by
A.Unterberger [8] (see also R.Shenoy and T.Parks [9]).

5 Star product on the symbols

Operators on the Hilbert space H have been mapped to functions on the time-frequency
half-plane Γ by the rule (3.16). Since the algebra of operators is non-abelian, the product
of operators is mapped into a composition law of functions that cannot be the ordinary
product. This situation is familiar from Weyl’s calculus where the composition law of
functions is known as Moyal’s product and is invariant by Heisenberg’s group. Analogous
products, invariant by diﬀerent groups, have been constructed by deformation of the usual
product and are generally referred to as star products (⋆-products) [10]. In the present
case, the composition law of symbols corresponding to the product of operators leads
directly to a star product that is invariant by the aﬃne group.

In the following, it will be convenient to use another notation for the operator

exp{−2iπ(uβ + vf )}. In fact, according to (4.11) and (4.12), the action of that operator
on a signal S(f ) can be written as

exp{−2iπ(uβ + vf )}S(f ) = e(r+1)u exp{−2iπf (v/u)(eu − 1)}S(f eu)

(5.1)

Comparing this expression with the deﬁnition (2.6) of representation U, we are able to
rewrite (5.1) as 1:

exp{−2iπ(uβ + vf )} S(f ) = U

The use of representation U(u, b) allows to take advantage of the group law and to write
the composition of operators as:

U(u, b)U(u′, b′) = U(u + u′, b + eu b′)

(5.3)

It shows directly that the product of two operators of type (5.1) is an operator of the
same type. With notation (5.2), the form (4.20) of the correspondence rule (3.15) between
functions and operators can be written as:

(5.10)

The exponential of function h(u1, v1, u2, v2) in (5.8) is what makes the diﬀerence with a
classical product. It can be replaced by its series expansion so that the integrals in (5.8)
can be performed. In the process, the following replacements take place:

where the contribution of operator T will be discussed below.

If (5.12) is rewritten in terms of t rather than β, using the deﬁnition:

β = tf,

∂β = (1/f ) ∂t

the result is reminiscent of the Weyl product. Actually, the diﬀerence lies in the presence
of the operator T (∂β1, ∂β2) which comes from the development in powers of u1 and u2 of:

T (u1, u2) = 2

u1eu1(eu2 − 1) − u2(eu1 − 1)
u1u2(eu1+u2 − 1)

As in Weyl’s case, the ﬁrst term in (5.12) is the usual product and the following terms
introduce derivatives of the symbols. It can be observed that the star product of two real-
valued functions is not real. This is a direct manifestation of the fact that the product of
hermitian operators is not hermitian.

Remark 5.1 From Remark 3.3, it follows that in a product of operators, the positive and
negative frequency parts are multiplied separately. Hence, the same property will hold for
the star product if its expression is extended to symbols deﬁned on the whole plane.

The star product simpliﬁes when one of the symbols depends only on one variable.
This will be illustrated by computing its expression when ˜A(β, f ) is equal either to β or
to a function of f alone and when ˜B(β, f ) is the generic distribution:

with Fourier transform (4.21) given by:

∆β0,f0(β, f ) = δ(β − β0)δ(f − f0)

6 Star bracket of symbols and hamiltonian ﬂow

6.1 Deﬁnition of the star bracket

A Lie bracket is now deﬁned on operators by the operation:

− 2πi[A, B] = −2πi(AB − BA)

(6.24)

This bracket deﬁnes a composition law on the subspace of hermitian operators. When
transformed by the correspondence rule, using the expression for the star product, this
bracket gives rise to an operation on real-valued functions that will be called star bracket
and denoted by { , }⋆. Thus the star bracket of symbols ˜A(β, f ) and ˜B(β, f ) is deﬁned
by:

{ ˜A, ˜B}⋆(β, f ) = −2πi( ˜A(β, f ) ⋆ ˜B(β, f ) − ˜B(β, f ) ⋆ ˜A(β, f ))

(6.25)

According to (5.12), the bracket can be written as;

{ ˜A(β, f ), ˜B(β, f )}⋆ =

f (∂f1∂β2 − ∂f2∂β1)(1 + 1

(6.27)

In fact, if the variable β is replaced by its deﬁnition (5.13), the expression (6.27)
becomes identical with the usual Poisson bracket on Γ. This is the same bracket as

16

obtained by Kirillov’s theory [7] when considering phase space as an orbit of the coadjoint
representation.

The form of the star bracket (6.26) is reminiscent of that obtained with the Weyl
calculus. However, due to the fact that operator T (∂β1, ∂β2) has no symmetry, derivatives
of arbitrary order will in general appear in the expression of the bracket.

The star bracket of two functions reduces to the Poisson bracket in some special cases.
This occurs when one of the functions is equal to any linear combination of β, f and ln f .
In fact, for any symbol X (β, f ), we have:

{β, X (β, f )}⋆ = f

X (β, f )

{f, X (β, f )}⋆ = − f

X (β, f )

{ln f, X (β, f )}⋆ = −

X (β, f )

The derivation of these formulas can be based on expressions (5.21), (5.23) and on their
counterpart with reverse order in the star products. Final results follow from the relations:

λ(u) − λ(−u) = u, λ(−u) = e−u λ(u)

(6.31)

which are veriﬁed by the function (4.15)

6.2 Extended covariance and hamiltonian ﬂows

Consider a one-parameter group of transformations on signals S(f ) deﬁned by an operator
O such that:

S(f ; α) = e−2iπαO

S(f ; 0)

with S(f ; 0) = S0(f ) given. Signal S(f ; α) veriﬁes the equation:

and the projector Π on S(f ; α) veriﬁes:

∂S(f ; α)
∂α

= −2iπα O S(f ; α)

∂Π
∂α

= −2iπ[ O, Π ]

Now, going to phase space, we know that the geometric symbol of Π is the aﬃne Wigner
function (4.7) for signal S(f ; α), and that the symbol of the bracket −2iπ[ , ] is the star
bracket { , }⋆. Thus equation (6.34) becomes the following equation in Γ:

∂P(t, f ; α)
∂α

= {O(t, f ) , P(t, f ; α)}⋆

(6.35)

where O(t, f ) is the symbol of operator O.

Consider now the case where the symbol O(t, f ) has the particular form:

OH (t, f ) = µtf + νf + σ ln f

(6.36)

17

(6.28)

(6.29)

(6.30)

(6.32)

(6.33)

(6.34)

where µ, ν and σ are real constants. From the values of the star brackets (6.28), (6.29)
and (6.30), it follows that the bracket in (6.35) reduces to Poisson’s bracket. As a result,
equation (6.35) takes the form of a Liouville equation with hamiltonian equal to OH (t, f ):

∂P(t, f ; α)
∂α

= {µtf + νf + σ ln f, P(t, f ; α)}P

(6.37)

= µf

∂P(t, f ; α)
∂f

− (µt + ν + (σ/f ))

∂P(t, f ; α)
∂t

This means that the α-evolution of the Wigner function is identical to that of an incom-
pressible ﬂuid in the time-frequency half-plane. Integration of equation (6.37) with the
initial condition

P(t, f ; 0) = P0(t, f )

gives:

P(t, f ; α) = P0

(−νµ−1 + (t + νµ−1) e−µα − σf −1 α) , f eµα
(cid:16)

(cid:17)

The evolution of the Wigner function in terms of parameter α has a counterpart in Hilbert
space that can be obtained using the symbolic calculus. The operator OH for this evolution
is found directly from (4.20)-(4.21) and has the expression:

(6.38)

(6.39)

(6.40)

OH = µβ + νf + σ ln f

where the operators β and f have been introduced in (2.8) and (2.9). The expression
(6.32) written for the operator OH then gives the α-evolution in the Hilbert space which
corresponds to the phase space evolution (6.39). In fact, this leads to a special form of a
general transformation which can be written as:

(u, b, c) : S(f ) −→ S′(f ) = e(r+1)u e−2iπbf f −2iπc S(euf ),

u, b, c ∈ IR

(6.41)

This transformation is a projective unitary representation of a three-parameter group G0
which has been studied in [11]. It has been proved that transformations (6.41) correspond
to symplectic transformations in the phase space.

7 Other symbolizations with geometrical features.

The method presented above to construct a symbolic calculus on the aﬃne group can
be embedded in a more general approach based on the consideration of three-parameter
groups containing the aﬃne group. These groups have been previously introduced in
[11] in connection with the search for time-frequency representations. They form a one-
parameter family labelled by a real number k and are denoted by Gk. We refer to the
paper [11] for the details concerning their deﬁnitions and their representations. We will
recall the results for the cases where k 6= 0, 1. Actually, the case k = 0 corresponds to
the case studied so far in this paper and it may be shown that results for k = 1 can be
deduced by continuity from the results for neighboring values.

The groups Gk, k 6= 0, 1 consists of elements (u, b, c) with the composition law:

gg′ = (u + u′, b + eu b′, c + eku c′)

(7.42)

18

Their relevant unitary representations in the Hilbert space H deﬁned in Section 2.1 are
given by:

Uk(u, b, c)S(f ) = e(r+1)u e−2iπ(bf +cf k) S(eu f )

The action of the groups in the time-frequency half-plane Γ is:

(t, f ) −→ (eu t + b + kce−(k−1)u f k−1, e−u f )

Following the same pattern as in section 2, we determine the subgroups of Gk that are
conjugate to the dilation subgroup. They are labelled by two real parameters ξ, η and
consist of:

Gξη = {(eu, ξ(1 − eu), η(1 − eku)}
The restriction of representations (7.43) to subgroups Gξη is:

UξηS(f ) = e(r+1)u e−2iπ(ξ(1−eu)f +η(1−eku)f k)S(f eu)

The eigenfunctions of Uξη are:

β (f ) = f −2iπβ−r−1 e−2iπ(ξf +ηf k)
ψξη

They transform under the full group Gk as:

U(u, b, c)ψξη

β (f ) = e−2iπβu ψξeu+b,ηeku+c

β

(f )

In phase space Γ, the curves invariant by action (7.44) restricted to Gξη are given by:

(t − ξ)f − kηf k = ˜β

˜β = β

A local study of ψξη
tion:

β (f ) analogous to that performed in Section 2.3 leads to the identiﬁca-

As in Section 2, we have achieved a correspondence between invariant structures in H
and Γ. But we now have one extra parameter labelling the vectors ψξη
β (f ) and the curves
(7.49). To proceed with the construction, we must ﬁx one of these parameters in such a
way that the aﬃne covariance of the procedure is preserved. Because of the transformation
law (7.48), the only possible choices are either η = 0 or β = β0 ﬁxed. The case η = 0
yields the calculus just developed in the preceding sections. The only possibility to obtain
a new calculus is to ﬁx the value of β and to let η free.

The same geometric construction as in Section 3 will be carried out. Consider an

operator A on H and form its diagonal matrix elements on ψξη

On the other hand, if A′(t, f ) = A(eut + b + kce−(k−1)u f k−1, a−1 f ), a direct com-
putation leads to:

Possibility of reconstruction of the operator A and of the function A(t, f ).

In spite of the fact that the functions ψξη
that the operator A is completely characterized by its diagonal elements (7.51).

β0(f ) do not form a basis, it can be shown

The reconstruction of the function A(t, f ) could be performed by inverting the Radon
transform (7.52).

These properties allow to base the correspondence rule on the identiﬁcation:

H (ξ, η) = I β0
I β0

Γ (ξ, η)

which can be seen as an extension of (3.14). The resulting correspondence rule has the
form:

A(t, f ) =

λk(u) = eu/2

Conversely the kernel of the operator A can be expressed in terms of the symbol by:

A(f1, f2) =

ZΓ

It may be noticed that the limit for k = 0 of function λk(u) is identical to λ(u) deﬁned in
(4.15). In that case, the relation (7.60) becomes a Fourier transform with respect to β = tf
and f and the rule (4.20)-(4.21) is recovered. In the general case, the Fourier transform
(4.21) is replaced by the k-dependent transform (7.60) for which Parseval’s formula does
not hold. As a consequence, the unitarity property (3.17) cannot be obtained.

However, it is possible to recover an expression for the scalar product of operators in
terms of symbols. This is accomplished by associating two symbols with any operator A:
the symbol A(t, f ) deﬁned by (7.56) and a dual symbol Ad(t, f ) deﬁned by:

Ad(t, f ) =

Z IR

where

f 2r+2

e2iπuβ0 e2iπ(tf −β0)(λk(u)−λk(−u)) A(f λk(u), f λk(−u)) µd(u) du

It can be observed that it is only in the case k = 0 that:

µd(u) = (λk(u)λk(−u))r+1

leading to

(λk(u) − λk(−u)) = 1

A(t, f ) = Ad(t, f )

For an arbitrary value of k, the unitarity formula is replaced by:

Tr (AB†) =

A(t, f )B∗

d(t, f ) dtdf

ZΓ

where A(t, f ) is the symbol of A and Bd(t, f ) is the dual symbol of B.

These diﬀerent correspondence rules may be of interest for the study of special opera-

tors. The case k = −1 where

λ−1(u) = eu/2

stands out. The symbolic calculus corresponding to k = −1 and β0 = 0 has been intro-
duced directly by A.Unterberger [12] who applied it in a mathematical context.

A Wigner function P β0

k (t, f ) can be associated with each k-calculus. Because of the
form of relation (7.65), the Wigner function of signal S(f ) is deﬁned as the dual symbol
of the projector on the signal. We thus arrive at a unique time-frequency distribution for
each value of (k, β0) which coincides, when β0 = 0 with one of the functions obtained in
[11].

8 Conclusion

A correspondence rule between functions on the time-frequency half-plane and operators
on the Hilbert space of positive-frequency signals has been obtained. The rule, which is
said geometric, is entirely based on the study of the aﬃne group and more specially on
the representations of its subgroups in the two domains. It is obtained, relatively to each
subgroup, by identiﬁcation of the decomposition in invariant subspaces with the corre-
sponding tomographic decomposition in the time-frequency half-plane. The construction
is very natural and the result can be considered as an aﬃne version of the Weyl rule
introduced in quantum mechanics.

In the correspondence, a Lie algebra of hermitian operators is transformed into a Lie
algebra of symbols, also called star algebra. The basic operations of this algebra are the
star product and the star bracket of symbols. Formulas for these operations have been
given. A special attention has been paid to the case where the star bracket reduces to a
Poisson bracket.

The obtained symbolic calculus has been integrated into a family of calculi covariant
by three-parameter groups Gk, k ∈ IR, containing the aﬃne group. In this family, the
geometric rule corresponds to the special value k = 0 and is the only one to ensure the
unitarity property.

Abstract. We provide a detailed account of the construction of a system of holographic 
optical  tweezers.  While  much  information  is  available  on  the  design,  alignment  and 
calibration  of  other  optical  trapping  configurations,  those  based  on  holography  are 
relatively poorly described. Inclusion of a spatial light modulator in the setup gives rise 
to  particular  design  trade-offs  and  constraints,  and  the  system  benefits  from  specific 
optimization strategies, which we discuss.

1. Introduction 
The introduction of holographic optical elements into optical tweezer setups has multiplied the 
possibilities of this technology for precisely trapping, moving and manipulating microparticles. 
First, static diffractive optical elements that could be generated by computer and manufactured 
by  photolithography,  enabled  the  simultaneous  creation  of  several  optical  traps  [1,  2]. 
Conversion  of  the  static  trap  arrays  into  dynamic  light  patterns  by  displaying  the  diffractive 
optical elements onto spatial light modulators was the next logical step [3-6]. 
These  special  displays  can  be  updated  at  video  rates  so  with  every  new  diffractive  element  a 
completely different optical potential is formed at the sample plane. Furthermore, holographic 
optical  tweezers  present  an  advantage  over  other  methods  of  dynamic  light  array  generation, 
such  as  time  sharing  [7],  in  that  the  modulator  spatially  modifies  the  phase  of  the  incoming 
wavefronts. Wavefront control easily permits three-dimensional positioning of the traps as well 
as  the  creation  of  beams  with  special  characteristics,  such  as  Bessel  or  Laguerre-Gaussian 
beams [8], which carry angular momentum.  
In  the  lapse  of  a  few  years  holographic  optical  tweezers  have  become  a  research  topic  with 
many  potential  applications  [9]  and  thus  have  turned  into  a  subfield  of  optical  trapping  of 
particular importance and projection. However, contrary to single-beam technology, which has 
been thoroughly documented on its many facets [10-14], holographic optical tweezers systems 
remain  comparatively  poorly  described.  The  inclusion  of  the  spatial  light  modulator  into  the 
optical  setup  has  important  design  implications  that  are  specific  to  this  technology.  Also,  the 
system  may  benefit  from  particular  optimization  strategies  that  are  worth  showing  and 
discussing. 
The  goal  of  this  paper  is  then  to  help  fill  that  gap  by  carefully  describing  and  analyzing  the 
design  and  construction  of  a  system  of  holographic  optical  tweezers,  a  material  that  we  have 
divided into three main parts. Section 1 analyzes the optical system constraints and uncovers the 
trade-offs between optical efficiency and resulting layout size. Also, several practical tips and 
design  proposals  for  two  different  systems  are  included  here.  We  believe  that  the  results 

contained in this section are of wide applicability. Section 2 is devoted exclusively to the spatial 
light modulator and includes information that is more dependent on the particular device that we 
use. The three subsections deal with phase-only modulation adjustment, angular dependence of 
the  reconstructed  holograms  and  correction  of  the  built-in  optical  aberrations  of  the  device. 
Finally, section 3 contains a complete analysis of the optical aberrations of the resulting optical 
systems  and  suggestions  on  how  to  achieve  diffraction-limited  performance  with  very  simple 
lenses. 
 
1. Design of the optical setup 
1.1. Optical system constraints 
Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a system of holographic optical tweezers. A continuous-
wave, TEM00 laser beam is first expanded and then collimated by lenses LE and LC. A pinhole 
spatially filters the light at the back focal plane of the expander lens, to ensure clean, Gaussian 
illumination on the spatial light modulator (SLM). The modulator, which may operate either by 
reflectance  or  transmittance,  is  sandwiched  between  polarizing  elements  with  specific 
orientations  that  depend  on  the  desired  configuration  (see  section  2).  After  passing  through  a 
telescope,  the  beam  is  reflected  upwards  by  a  dichroic  mirror  and  is  focused  by  the  high 
numerical  aperture  microscope  objective  on  the  sample  plane.  Usually,  this  latter  step  takes 
place  inside  a  commercial  inverted  microscope  so  that  the  illumination  system,  objective  lens 
and other optical elements can still be used for imaging purposes. For example, light from the 
illumination column is transmitted through the dichroic and can reach the sample or the sample 
plane  is  still  projected  on  the  CCD  by  the  objective  and  tube  lens,  allowing  observation  and 
recording of the experiments.

The  telescope  formed  by  lenses  L1  and  L2  should  be  designed  to  fulfil  the  following 
requirements: 

1)  The  SLM  is  imaged  onto  the  exit  pupil  of  the  microscope  objective  [6,  8]  to  prevent 

vignetting of high frequency Fourier components, which get diffracted at larger angles. 

2)  To make use of its whole active area, the image of the modulator should be scaled down 
to match the size of the objective back aperture. Furthermore, an overfilling of the SLM 
by the laser will result in an overfilling of the aperture. This, which is necessary, can be 
accomplished with the first telescope (inverted) formed by lenses LE and LC. The ratio 
should be adjusted to optimise trapping efficiency as in non-holographic setups [15, 16]. 
Gaussian  laser  beams  are  typically  expanded  so  that  the  beam  waist  roughly  matches 
the aperture (here, the size of the SLM). 

3)  Finally, it must provide parallel illumination to the infinity-corrected objective (figure 
1), hence the telescopic arrangement. Most modern microscope objectives are corrected 
to work with the sample at the front focal plane. Light rays are therefore parallel after 
the objective, which is advantageous since additional optics, such as fluorescence filters 
or polarizers, can be placed in the path of those parallel rays with negligible effects on 

focus or aberration correction [17]. An important consequence is that infinity-corrected 
microscopes need no lenses in the epifluorescence path to collimate light, and thus the 
two lenses of the telescope can be chosen and placed with total freedom, in contrast to 
older, fixed tube length microscopes [14].   

Also, regarding the optical system, since the spatial light modulator is illuminated by collimated 
light and the diffracted beams are observed at the focal plane of the objective lens (focal length, 
f), the relation between the complex reflectance, R(u,v), of the modulator and the electric field at 
the sample plane, E(x,y), is, except for some phase terms [18] often irrelevant, that of a Fourier 
transform:

Considering these requirements for the telescope, distance d1 from the SLM to the first lens L1 
and  distance  d2  from  the  second  lens  L2  to  the  objective  exit  pupil  (figure  2)  are  subject  to 
several  constraints.  The  distance  between  these  two  lenses  must  be  the  addition  of  their  focal 
lengths, d=f1 + f2, for them to form a telescope. Furthermore, the SLM is imaged by this system 
with an absolute lateral magnification given by:

Incidentally, this magnification is independent of distances d1 and d2, since a ray that leaves the 
edge of the SLM and travels parallel to the optical axis will always exit the system at the same 
height (see figure 2). Total distance, L, from the SLM to the objective back aperture is therefore:

The 4-f configuration is a common arrangement for the imaging telescope. The SLM is placed 
at  the  front  focal  plane  of  the  first  lens  (d1 = f1)  so  that  the  image  is  formed  at  the  back  focal 
plane of the second lens (d2 = f2), as shown in figure 3b. Light rays are parallel between the two

Interestingly, more compact setups can be built in this latter case. For a given focal length f1, as 
magnification  M  does  not  depend  on  SLM  position,  the  shortest  overall  length  L  is  achieved 
when  the  SLM  is  placed  as  close  to  the  first  lens  as  possible  (minimum  d1,  equation  3).  The 
variation  of  L  with  d1  for  a  practical  example  corresponding  to  the  analysis  in  section  1.2 
(M = 0.3, f1 = 250 mm), is depicted in figure 4a. It can be seen that L approaches its minimum 
value of L=
The  price  for  this  smaller  footprint  is  a  lower  light  efficiency.  Indeed,  let  us  assume  that  the 
entrance  pupil  diameter,  2φ ,  of  lens  L2  is  smaller  or  equal  than  that  of  lens  L1,  1φ ,  (that  is, 
). This is normally the case in telescopes, as the diameter of a beam will get smaller at 
1φ φ≤

the  output. We  see  that whenever  the  SLM  is  placed  at  a distance 
 (cases  (a)  and  (b)), 
lens L1 is both the aperture stop and the entrance pupil of the imaging system. Thus the distance 
φ= . On the contrary, 
from L1 to the entrance pupil is 

as the modulator gets closer to lens L1 (d

Figure  4b  is  a  graphical  representation  of  equation  (6)  for  M = 0.3,  f1 = 250 mm,  and 
φ1 = φ2 = 22.9 mm. It shows that placement of the SLM at the front focal plane of lens L1 (the 
4-f  configuration)  maximizes  light  efficiency  although  it  is  intermediate  in  terms  of  overall 
length. The modulator can be placed closer to lens L1 if a smaller optical system is desired. We, 
however,  prefer  to  retain  the  light  gathering  capacity  and  shorten  the  optical  system  by  some 
other  means,  as  discussed  below,  so  a  4-f  configuration  is  assumed  for  the  telescope  in  what 
follows.

numerical  aperture,  sin σ,  of  the  telescope  with  distance  d1.  The  dashed  red  line  indicates  the  case 
d1 = f1. 

 
Let us now focus on the practical  constraints for distances d1 and d2. When using an inverted 
commercial microscope, the minimum distance from lens L2 to the exit pupil of the objective, 
d2, is around some 300 mm, if the lens is placed outside the microscope (roughly the length of 
the  fluorescence  path).  This  limitation  determines  to  a  large  extent  the  overall  size  and  often 
leads  to  large  optical  systems:  in  effect,  for  d1 =  f1,  d2 = f2  (4-f  arrangement),  equation  (3) 
becomes:

The active area of the spatial light modulators used in optical tweezers range from about 8 mm 
(BNS P512 [19]) to about 20 mm (Hamamatsu X8267 [20]) on a side. On the other hand, the 
exit pupil diameter of high-aperture, immersion objectives is between 3 and 5 mm. Thus, lateral 
magnification  M  takes  values  between  0.1  and  0.6.  For  a  typical  value  of  M = 0.4  and  with 
d2 = 300 mm, d1 becomes 750 mm and finally L = 2.1 m. 

Such  long  working  lengths  help  to  minimize  optical  aberrations  [2]  and  are  thus  frequently 
viewed as  a  desirable feature. However, our results indicate (section 3) that aberrations in the 
optical  train  are  not  really  an  issue  and  can  be  controlled  quite  easily  by  use  of  a  few  simple 
tricks. Thus, distance L could be much shortened if d2 were reduced by placing lens L2 inside 
the  microscope.  Practical  details  on  how  to  do  this  are  left  to  the  proposed  solution  of  next 
section 1.2. 
Reduction  of  distance  d2  leads  to  reduction  of  distance  d1  as  both  are  linked  by  equation  (2). 
This  latter  distance  is  subject  to  design  constraints  of  its  own  and  frequently  cannot  be  made 
smaller than a certain limit. That should be considered when reducing the design. 
For example, minimal distance between SLM and lens L1, d1, can be just a few centimeters for 
transmittance  SLMs  [3,  4],  the  space  required  to  allow  polarizing  elements  to  fit  in  between. 
However,  reflective  SLMs  are  more  commonly  used  as  they  provide  higher  resolutions  and  a 
larger  fill  factor.  They  do  pose  different  geometrical  requirements.  A  possible  arrangement 
would  be  to  place  the  reflective  modulator  perpendicular  to  the  optical  axis  [21]  and  then 
redirect the modulated beam out with a beam-splitter, as sketched in figure 5a. However, control 
of the input and output polarization is a much desired feature of the setup as it may allow free 
access  to  the  different  operating  modes  of  the  device  (such  as  the  phase-only  modulation 
operating curve). Both constraints, polarization control and on-axis operation, can be met by the 
use of a non-polarizing beam-splitter, but the round trip path through that element would result 
in a loss of 75% of the incident light. This is unacceptable considering the large power required 
for trapping even a small number of samples, so the device is usually operated at small incident 
angles θ (figure 5b) [22]. This sets the minimal distance at:

that required for separating input and output beams. 
Figure  5c  shows  distance  d1min  as  a  function  of  θ  for  a  medium  size  SLM,  φSLM ~ 14.6 mm 
(Holoeye  Photonics,  LC-R  2500,  see  section  2,  below).  For  small  angles, θ ~ 2.5º,  minimum 
distance is d1min ~ 170 mm. Allowance for polarizing elements would add some centimeters to 
the total count. At any rate, in practice, this result appears to be less restrictive than limitations 
coming from position of lens L2.

1.2. Optical setup: proposals and practical considerations. 
According to the analysis of the optical system constraints carried out in the preceding section, 
we built a system of holographic optical tweezers as follows: a Nd:YVO4 laser beam (Viasho 
Technology, λ = 532 nm, 120 mW) illuminates a twisted-nematic liquid-crystal reflective SLM 
(Holoeye  Photonics,  LC-R  2500),  sandwiched  between  a  polarizer  and  an  analyzer  with  the 
proper orientations to achieve phase-mostly modulation (see section 2). Light after the telescope 

enters  a  commercial  inverted  microscope.  We  show  results  for  two  different  models,  a  Nikon 
Eclipse  TE-2000E  and  a  Motic  AE-31,  equipped  with  oil-immersion,  high  numerical  aperture 
objectives  (Nikon  Plan  Fluor  100x,  1.30  NA  and  Motic  Plan  achromatic  100x,  1.25  NA, 
respectively). 
Distance d2 from lens L2 to the objective exit pupil is greatly reduced by placing the lens inside 
the  microscope  body.  This  is  straightforward  for  the  TE-2000  microscope,  as  a  lens  can  be 
easily  retrofitted  into  standard  Nikon  fluorescence  cubes.  Each  cube  has  1’’  threaded  circular 
aperture on one of its six surfaces, for the excitation filter to  be mounted. However, lenses or 
any  other  optical  or  mechanical  component  can  be  attached  there  instead.  Figure  6a  shows  a 
photograph  of  a  cube  with  the  dichroic  mirror  inside  and  lens  L2  on  the  input  face,  directly 
screwed into place. Although not visible, an absorbance filter is also present on the bottom side 
(exit) to filter the laser out, thus preventing camera saturation. 
On  the  contrary,  a  custom-made  modification  was  necessary  for  the  Motic  AE-31  cube,  an 
inexpensive 
inverted  microscope  with  fluorescence  capacity.  A  centering  mechanical 
component containing the cube is also shown in figure 6b.

d ≈

0.7 m

275 mm

 
By adopting this solution distance d2 goes down to about 75 mm for the Nikon microscope and 
to  100 mm  for  the  Motic  instrument.  If  the  vertical  size  of  the  Holoeye  modulator  (see 
specifications  in  section  2)  is  imaged  by  the  telescope  to  match  the  objective  exit  pupil 
(diameter of about 4 mm, Nikon Plan Fluor 100x), the magnification would then be M = 4/14.5. 
If  we  place  the  SLM  on  the  front  focal  plane  of  lens  L1  then  1
(corresponding  to 
d2 = 75 mm),  the  total  length  between  the  SLM  and  the  microscope  objective  becomes 
.  This  is  much  shorter  than  the  2.1 m  we  obtained  in  section  1.1,  especially 
L ≈
considering that part of the path is inside the  microscope. Conveniently, the distance between 
lenses L1 and L2, which is about 75 + 275 mm = 350 mm, is large enough to allow placing lens 
L1  outside  the  microscope.  Similar  conclusions  can  be  drawn  for  d
2 = 100 mm  (Motic 
microscope). 
Finally,  the  required  tilt θ  of  the  SLM  (
)  with  respect  to  the  incident  beam 
is  only  about  a  few 
(figure  3b)  such  that  it  can  be  put  as  close  to  lens  L1  as  1
degrees,  according  to  equation  (9).  Nevertheless,  we  place  the  SLM  tilted  45º,  because  it 
simplifies the arrangement of the whole optical setup. We found that, although not lying on a 
plane perpendicular to the optical axis, the SLM is capable of producing fairly good traps when 
functioning  in  a  suitable  phase-only  configuration.  These  issues  are  analyzed  in  detail  in  next 
section. 
Figure 7 shows pictures of the optical setups built for the Nikon Eclipse TE-2000E (figure 7a)

2. Holoeye LC-R 2500 spatial light modulator 
The  Holoeye  LC-R  2500  used  in  our  setups  is  a  reflective,  twisted  nematic,  liquid  crystal  on 
silicon  (LCOS)  spatial  light  modulator,  and  was  selected  for  its  high  resolution,  good  optical 
quality  and  low  cost.  It  has  an  active  area  of  19.5x14.6 mm2,  divided  into  1024x768  square 
pixels  (pixel  pitch = 19 µm,  fill  factor  93%)  that  are  electrically  addressed  by  an  8-bit  signal 
coming  from  a  computer  graphic  card  through  the  DVI  interface  [23].  The  SLM  can  provide 
from  0  to  2π  phase  modulation  in  the  visible  region  (400-700 nm),  although  usually  with  a 
certain  amount  of  amplitude  modulation,  which  is  inherent  of  twisted  nematic  liquid  crystal 
modulators  [24].  The  response  depends  on  the  polarization  state  of  the  light  both  before  and 
after  the  SLM  and  can  be  changed  by  adjusting  the  polarization  elements  shown  in  Figure  7. 
Since  we  are  not  using  the  device  at  the  near  normal  incidence  assumed  by  the  manufacturer 
[22], modulation response was measured and adjusted. 
In  section  2.1  we  give  details  of  a  configuration  for  which  there  is  nearly  uniform  amplitude 
modulation  and  a  maximum  phase  shift  of  2π  (phase-mostly  configuration),  when  the  device 
makes an angle of 45º with the incident light. Also, in section 2.2 we analyze the effect of the 
oblique  incidence  on  the  reconstruction  of  holograms.  Finally,  section  2.3  is  devoted  to  the 
correction of certain aberrations of the display caused by the curvature of the silicon backplane. 
 
2.1. Characterization: phase-only configuration 
SLM  characterization  consists  of  determining  the  amplitude  and  phase  modulation  values  for 
the  different  addressing  voltages,  for  a  fixed  orientation  of  both  input  and  output  polarizers. 
Figure  8a  shows  a  sketch  of  the  Mach-Zehnder  interferometer  used  to  measure  the  phase:  a 
collimated  laser  beam  (λ = 532 nm)  is  divided  by  the  first  beam-splitter  and  a  CCD  camera 
registers the interference fringes between the two plane waves; the phase variation introduced 
by  the  SLM  placed  in  one  arm  of  the  interferometer  is  seen  as  a  fringe  displacement  on  the 
interference plane, and can be measured with the method described in [25]. The orientation of 
the  quarter-wave  plate  and  polarizers  determine  the  configuration  of  the  device.  Amplitude 
modulation is measured simply by placing an intensity detector before and after the SLM. 
The  best  phase-mostly  operating  curve  found  is  shown  in  figure  8b.  It  is  achieved  when  the 
modulator is sandwiched between two linear polarizers, oriented at -45º and 26º with respect to 

the longest side of the display. Positive angles are measured counter-clockwise, when looking at 
the  polarizer  by  the  side  first  touched  by  the  laser.  Maximum  phase  shift  reaches  1.98π, 
amplitude is almost constant with an intensity contrast of only 1:1.13, and optical efficiency is 
around  50%.  Finally,  figure  8c  shows  the  phase  modulation  as  a  function  of  the  grey  level 
(addressing  voltage),  which  is  not  uniform  and  should  be  linearized  when  computing  the 
holograms.

grey level (gl). 
 
2.2. Reconstruction of holograms. 
As explained above, the modulator is placed at 45º with respect to the beam direction. Here, we 
analyze how this may change the reconstruction of the displayed hologram, R(u,v), and affect 
the performance of the optical traps. When the SLM plane is normal to the beam direction, the 
electric field E(x,y) at the sample plane is described by [18]:

where  d0  is  the  distance  between  the  SLM  and  the  front  principal  plane  of  the  objective  (H, 
figure  9a),  f’  is  the  effective  focal  length  (f’=f/n),  and  FTλf’[R(u,v)]  stands  for  the  Fourier 
transform of R(u,v) evaluated at frequencies x/λf’ and y/ λf’. 
This  formula  explicitly  shows  all  phase  terms  that  do  not  appear  in  equation  (1).  These  are 
frequently  irrelevant  for  calculating  holograms,  because  they  disappear  when  recording  the 
intensity of the diffracted light, but need to be considered here.   
As the modulator is tilted, distance d0 is no longer constant. Let di be the distance between the 
pixels of the ith row of the SLM and principal plane H. Thus, di = d + ∆di (see figure 9a). Then 
E(x,y)  in  equation  (10)  is  different  for  each  row  and  therefore,  the  proper  expression  for  the 
reconstructed  intensity  I  needs  to  be  written  adding  up  terms  based  on  equation  (10),  for 
different distances di. It is straightforward to obtain the following mathematical expression:

where FTλf’[R(u,vi)] is the Fourier transform of the ith row of the hologram R(u,v). 
An example simulated using this equation is shown figure 9b.  A hologram was computed by 
using the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm [26] to obtain three equal intensity traps. The simulation 
realistically  takes  into  account  both  the  actual  phase-mostly  modulation  curve  and  the 
geometrical  parameters  of  the  SLM  (section  2).  The  figure  shows  a  typical  result:  as  a 
consequence of the SLM tilt, the intensity of the three traps is no longer uniform (a small replica 
is  also  visible).  These  differences  are  hardly  noticeable  experimentally  and  can  be  corrected 

during hologram computation if desired. Our conclusion is that use of the SLM at large angles 
to  the  optical  axis  does  not  seem  to  pose  any  major  difficulty  and  may  simplify  the  optical 
layout.

2.3. Modulator aberrations and correction 
A  liquid  crystal  on  silicon  (LCOS)  micro-display  essentially  consists  of  a  liquid  crystal  layer 
between a cover glass and a silicon backplane that contains the driving circuitry and which is 
coated  with  aluminium  to  form  a  highly  reflective  surface.  The  backplane  is  manufactured  at 
commercial VLSI foundries using standard CMOS methods and processes, which unfortunately 
are not optimized with optical performance in mind. As a consequence, although the resulting 
devices  can  be  made  flat  at  the  pixel  level  to  prevent  scattering  and  improve  diffraction 
efficiency,  they  present  bows  and  warps  at  the  dice  level  [27]  that  frequently  give  rise  to 
important optical aberrations. 
In  particular,  the  beam  reflected  by  our  Holoeye  modulator,  when  focused  by  the  microscope 
objective,  forms  two  light  lines  instead  of  a  diffraction-limited  spot.  The  two  lines  are 
perpendicular to each other and appear at two different focal planes in a behavior similar to the 
presence  of  astigmatism  (refer  to  figure  10).  Figure  10b  (left  and  right)  corresponds  to  the 
images captured at the two foci when a pair of optical traps is generated. The effect, which also 
takes place at normal incidence, reveals the lack of flatness of the device surface and seems to 
be a widespread problem [28].

Fortunately,  it  is  relatively  easy  to  find  an  anamorphic  phase  function  that  reverses  the  effect 
and  which  can  then  be  added  to  any  trapping  hologram,  eventually  correcting  the  aberration. 
The correction is dependent on focal lengths fA1, fA2 and α, and is modeled after the following

We  have  experimentally  found  that  the  following  parameters  are  satisfactory:  fA1 = 30 m,

traps  at  the  mid-point  of  the  two  foci  (left)  and  the  spots  after  correction  (right).  A  more

3. Aberrations in the optical train. 
Single-beam optical tweezers rely on the gradient component of the light force to trap and move 
material particles. Light must be brought to a sharp focus so exquisitely corrected microscope 
objectives are required to form the optical traps. Optical aberrations are always a major cause of 
concern  since  their  detrimental  effect  on  trap  stiffness  is  well  documented  [29].  Then,  an 
accurate analysis of aberrations of the complete optical system should be included in the design 
process as a final stage. 
In this section, we perform ray tracing simulations with a commercial optical design software 
(Zemax)  to  study  the  spherical  aberration  in  the  focal  plane  of  the  microscope  objective,  for 
different qualities and combinations of outside lenses. The microscope objective is considered a 
paraxial lens (thus free of aberrations) to isolate the influence of the other lenses on the quality 
of the focal spot. 
As  our  objectives  are  infinity-corrected,  spherical  aberration  is  minimized  at  the  front  focal 
plane. The focal length in air, f, can be obtained from the magnification, m, and the focal length 
of  the  microscope  tube  lens,  ftube, 
[17].  Nikon  and  Motic  objective  focal  lengths 
f
are 2 mm and 1.2 mm, respectively. 
This section is organized as follows: first, in section 3.1 a perfectly parallel beam is supposed to 
illuminate lens L1 to isolate the effect of the imaging telescope formed by lenses L1 and L2. In 
section  3.2,  the  best  solution  found  in  section  3.1  is  analyzed  jointly  with  the  beam  expander 
and collimator. Whenever possible, we use commercial standard single lenses. Unless otherwise 
specified, these are made of BK7, which has a good transmission throughout the visible and the 
near infrared (more than 90%). Also, in practice, antireflection coatings should be used to help 
reduce transmission losses and stray reflections. 
Aberrations  introduced  by  the  SLM  are  not  taken  into  account  as  they  have  presumably  been 
corrected  with  the  method  developed  in  section  2.3.  However,  we  do  consider  that  the 
modulator is tilted by 45º in the horizontal (long) direction and that the illuminated area of the 
device, as well as the active area imaged onto the exit pupil of the objective, has an elliptical 
shape.   
 
3.1. Imaging telescope (L1 and L2) 
Again, we assume a 4-f configuration for the telescope (section 1) and we analyze the setup for 
the Nikon microscope, which needs shorter focal lengths than the Motic and is therefore more 
prone to aberrations. Lens L2 required focal length is f2 =d2 = 75 mm and lens L1 focal length is 
chosen to be f1 = 250 mm (M = 0.3). This is a standard value on many vendor catalogs and it is 
then  a  lens  easy  to  find  commercially,  which  fulfills  magnification  requirements:  for  an  exit 
pupil diameter of 4 mm (Nikon Plan Fluor 100x objective), the SLM active area imaged onto 
the objective exit pupil is elliptical with its vertical and horizontal axis of about 700 and 1000 
pixels, respectively. The total length given by equation (8) is in this case L = 650 mm. 
We  chose  plano-convex  lenses  since  these  are  the  best  singlet  form  for  either  focusing 
collimated light or for collimating a point source. Thus, placing two plano-convex lenses with 
their flat surfaces facing one another is the best simple solution for a telescope with regard to 
spherical aberration [30]. Figure13a shows the spot diagram obtained in the focal plane of the 
microscope  objective  with  this  configuration.  The  results  are  worse  if  the  same  plano-convex 
lenses are used but with a wrong orientation (curved surfaces facing one another, figure 13b) or 
for  two  bi-convex  lenses  (results  not  shown).  Inexpensive  standard  Thorlabs  1’’  BK7  singlet 
lenses  are  used  in  our  simulations:  LA1461  (250 mm  plano-convex),  LA1608  (75 mm  plano-
convex), LB1056 (250 mm bi-convex) and LB1901 (75 mm bi-convex). 
The RMS radius (root-mean-square radial size) indicated on the plots gives an approximate idea 
of  the  spread  of  the  ray  bundle.  Roughly  speaking,  if  all  rays  are  well  within  the  Airy  disk 
(represented in the figures by a circle), the system is often considered to be diffraction limited.  
The results show that two plano-convex lenses with their curved surfaces facing the collimated 
beams  (figure  13a)  produce  a  diffraction-limited  spot  (RMS  radius = 0.093 µm,  Airy 
radius = 0.46 µm),  whereas  in  the  opposite  case,  shown  in  figure  13b,  do  not  (RMS 

radius = 0.369 µm).  Also,  if  the  telescope  is  made  with  two  bi-convex  lenses  the  result  is 
intermediate (RMS radius = 0.137 µm).

plano-convex,  curved  surfaces  facing  collimated  beams  (b)  plano-convex,  flat  surfaces  facing 
collimated beams. 

 
As a conclusion, simple plano-convex lenses are good enough choice for the imaging telescope. 
There is no need for more sophisticated optics, even in systems like the one we are analyzing 
that  reduce  dimensions  by  use  of  lenses  with  short  focal  lengths  (such  as  f1 = 250 mm, 
f2 = 75 mm). 
 
3.2. Beam expander and collimator (LE and LC) 
As  mentioned  in  section  1.1,  the  laser  beam  expander  and  collimator  also  form  a  telescope, 
although used in reverse. It will increase the beam diameter of an incident Gaussian beam by: 
 

M
=%

f

(14) 

 
while  simultaneously  reducing  the  beam  angular  divergence  by  the  inverse  factor 1/ M% .  We 
have chosen for our simulations fE = 8 mm, fC = 100 mm so that a laser beam diameter of about 
1.1 mm (as ours) is magnified 12.5 times. The beam then illuminates some 720 vertical pixels of 
the Holoeye modulator, in good agreement with the imaged active area we set in section 3.1 and 
overfilling requirements.  
We  assume  that  lens  LE  is  a  paraxial  lens  and  we  focus  our  analysis  on  collimating  lens  LC 
alone. This is so because LE is either not necessary, when a fibre laser is used, or it is a well 
corrected  microscope  objective,  when  light  is  expanded  by  a  spatial  filter.  In  any  case,  the 
collimator receives a high quality Gaussian beam that we assume is free from aberrations.  
Figure  14a  shows  the  results  for  an  inexpensive  plano-convex  singlet  (Thorlabs  LA1509,  1’’, 
BK7, 100 mm) with the right orientation. For these conditions, the spot is not diffraction limited 
(RMS  radius = 1.208 µm,  Airy  radius = 0.46 µm),  which  is  not  surprising.  For  example  when 
compared to lens L2, even though its focal length is somewhat larger (fC = 100 mm, f2 = 75 mm), 
it works at a higher aperture (related by magnification M). Lens LC is the most critical element 
in the system with regard to aberrations and needs higher quality optics. 
We tried an achromatic doublet corrected in the visible region: 1’’ Thorlabs lens made of BK7 
and  SF5  (item  number  AC-254-100-A1).  The  result,  plotted 
in  figure  14b  (RMS 
radius = 0.244 µm),  shows  that  spherical  aberration  is  substantially  reduced  and  that  the  spot 
can now be considered diffraction-limited.

doublet. 

 
In  conclusion,  special  care  should  be  taken  when  selecting  lens  LC.  Because  of  its  working 
conditions, it is especially prone to suffer form spherical aberration and a corrected lens, such as 
a doublet or an aspheric, needs to be used. 
 
4. Results and final remarks 
Figure  15  is  illustrative  of  the  typical  results  that  may  be  obtained  with  the  system.  Many 
quality traps showing diffraction rings can be simultaneously produced. Importantly, the central 
spot is very small (see Figure 15a), which we believe is indicative of a well controlled spatial 
light modulator. A large DC term creates an unwanted trap at the center of the sample and may 
need  to  be  filtered  out.  A  deficient  phase  only  curve  or  failure  to  correct  the  nonlinearities 
between driving voltages and phase values (figure 8c) in computing the holograms, contribute 
to this central spot. Light reflected at the front face of the SLM or unmodulated because of fill 
factor issues are also small contributions that cannot be eliminated. 
Finally, Figures 15b and 15c show polystyrene microspheres trapped and moved independently 
in three dimensions.

ABSTRACT 
 
The small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering, time resolved X-ray small-angle and wide-angle 
diffraction  coupled  with  differential  scanning  calorimetry  have  been  applied  to  the  investigation  of 
unilamellar and multilamellar dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) vesicles in sucrose buffers with 
sucrose  concentrations  from  0  to  60%.  Sucrose  buffer  decreased  vesicle  size  and  polydispersity  and 
increased an X-ray contrast between phospholipid membrane and bulk solvent sufficiently. No influence 
of sucrose on the membrane thickness or mutual packing of hydrocarbon chains has been detected. The 
region  of  sucrose  concentrations  30%-40%  created  the  best  experimental  conditions  for  X-ray  small-
angle experiments with phospholipid vesicles.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The  structure  and  properties  of  phospholipids  membranes,  as  they  serve  as  a  simple  and 
appropriate  model  for  biological  membranes,  are  investigated  intensively  by  X-ray  and  neutron 
scattering techniques [1-4,8,9,16,19]. The structural investigation of drug delivery systems based on the 
lipid  vesicles  (liposomes)  is  a  perspective  direction  for  SR  application  [5].  Investigation  of  model 
biological membranes and mixed lipid/surfactant systems is one of the problems of interest [3,9]. The 
general problem of finding the universal solvent of suitable contrast for SR on highly diluted systems of 
biological  importance  is  not  solved  yet.  Great  polydispersity  in  the  sizes  of  the  membrane  vesicles  in 
pure  water  constitutes  another  unsolved  problem.  In  our previous synchrotron investigations of mixed 
phospholipid/surfactant  systems,  40%  sucrose/water  solution  was  used  as  a  contrast  buffer  [3].  New 
model for the evaluation of data from scattering on large multilamellar vesicles was developed recently 
[8].  This  model  describes  the  internal  membrane  structure  by  means  of  two  strip  functions,  one 
corresponding to the region of polar head group and the other to the region of hydrocarbon chains. The 
introduction of a technique to create stable unilamellar vesicles with low size polydispersity can give a 
chance to upgrade the model in order to describe the internal membrane structure more precisely.  

One of the important properties of sugars is possibility to stabilize the membranes and proteins 
during the drying. It is currently discussed in literature that sugars can replace the water molecules in 
dry  lipid  and  protein  systems  [10].  Sugars  (trehalose  and  sucrose)  also  decrease  the  vesicles  leakage 
[11]. Dry vesicles can be stored in the sucrose glasses after the water evaporation [12]. 

The sucrose buffer has been applied for the investigation of micelle and vesicle structures by X-
ray  and  neutron  scattering  [9].  The  purpose  of  present  work  is  to  introduce  the  main  results  of  the 
sucrose buffer properties investigation in the range of sucrose concentrations 0−60%.  
 
2. EXPERIMENT  
 
Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) - C36H72NO8P, 8 Lauryl Ether (C12E8) - C25H58O9 
and  sucrose  -  C12H22O11  were  purchased  from  Sigma  (France).  The  unilamellar  vesicles  were 
prepared  from  1%  (w/w)  of  DMPC  suspension  in  the  sucrose/water  solution  by  extrusion  through 
polycarbonate filter with 500Å pore diameter as described in [1]. The multilamellar liposomes for the 
diffraction  experiment  were  prepared  in  such  a  way  that  the  number  of  solvent  molecules  per  DPPC 
molecule  was  kept  constant.  Let  us  call  NSUC,  Nw,  Nlip  the  number  of  sucrose,  water,  and  DMPC 
molecules, respectively. For DMPC in pure water, the ratio Nw / Nlip = 37.7 corresponds to 1:1 weight 
ratio. For DMPC in sucrose /water solvent the ratio (NSUC + Nw) / Nlip was kept equal to 37.7.  
The small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out 
 
at  D22  spectrometer  of  DCI  synchrotron  ring  at  LURE,  France.  The  small-angle  neutron  scattering 
experiments (SANS) with unilamellar vesicles were carried out at YuMO spectrometer in Dubna, Russia 
[1,2,16]. The model of infinitely thin sphere was applied for the interpretation of the SAXS curves in the 
region of scattering vector q from 0.005Å-1 to 0.04Å-1 [3]. The macroscopic scattering cross section is

where n is the number of vesicles per unit volume, R-vesicle radius, dl- membrane thickness, ∆ρ - X-
ray  contrast  between  membrane  and  aqueous  sucrose  solution.  Due  to  the  vesicles  polydispersity,  the 
macroscopic  cross  section  was  smeared  with  the  introduced  Gaussian  distribution  of  vesicles  radii, 
which gave the final expression for the vesicles macroscopic cross section Ic(q)

where  σ  is  the  standard  deviation  of  R.  The  Gaussian  distribution  of  vesicles  radii  was  used  as  have 
been described in SANS study of egg yolk phosphatidylcholine vesicles [1].  
The  time  resolved  diffraction  coupled  with  DSC  was  used  to  collect  information  from  small-
 
angle and wide-angle diffraction on the multilamellar membrane structures as described in detail in [4, 
14].  The  multilayered  structure  repeat  distance  d  was  determined  from  the  position  of  the  first 
diffraction peak using Bragg equation: 2·d·sinθ = λ, where θ is a half of the scattering angle.

where,  χ-  sucrose  concentration  (w/w),  D(χ)-  density  of  sucrose/water  solution  in  g/cm3  [15]. 
∆ρ = ρDMPC − ρsolvent is a contrast between membrane and solvent. The results of contrast calculations 
are shown in Fig. 1.  
In SAXS experiments the sucrose concentration range from 0 to 50% (w/w) was chosen because 
 
of  the  limited  viscosity  increase  in  this  domain.  The  SAXS  spectra  from  each  sample  were  collected 
during 20min. The experimental macroscopic cross sections of DMPC vesicles at T=30oC with sucrose 
concentrations 0%, 20%, 30%, 45% are presented in Fig. 2. The spectra for the sucrose concentrations 
20%,  30%,  45%  were  fitted  well  by  the  model  of  infinitely  thin  sphere  (Eq. 1)  with  Gaussian 
distribution  of  vesicle  sizes  (Eq.  2).  The  scattering  curve  from  vesicles  in  pure  water  has  too  poor 
statistics  to  be  interpreted.  The  macroscopic  cross  section  of  vesicles  increases  with  the  increase  of 
sucrose  concentration  due  to  the  increase  in  the  contrast  as  shown  in  Fig. 1.  At  sucrose  concentration 
15%, the statistical errors decreased down to the values that give opportunity for the model application. 
The  results  for  sucrose  concentration  in  the  interval  15-50%  are  presented  in  Table 1.  The  average 
radius  of  vesicle  and  polydispersity  have  their  minimum  values  in  the  range  of  30-40%  sucrose.  This 
interval exhibits the best experimental conditions for the study of vesicles structure by X-ray scattering. 
Fig. 1  presents  the  comparison  between  theoretical  values  of  the  contrast  and  contrast  values 
determined  experimentally  from  the  measured  values  of  macroscopic  cross-section,  R ,  σ,  and  dl, 
according  to  the  Eqs. (1)  and  (2).  The  membrane  thickness  was  determined  from  SANS  experiment, 
which  gives  a  constant  value  of  the  membrane  thickness  dl=38.8±0.8Å  at  T=30oC  for  the  sucrose 
concentration in the range 0-40% [1,2,16]. This value was used in the calculations of the contrast from 
the  experimentally  measured  SAXS  curves.  The  values  determined  by  different  methods  are  in  good 
agreement.  

Other solvents, such as glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), can increase the contrast for 
the  phospholipid  membranes  relative  to  that  for  water.  At  T=30oC,  the  electron  density  of  H2O  is 
3.35⋅1023e/cm3,  the  electron  density  of  glycerol  -  3.60⋅1023e/cm3,  the  electron  density  of  DMSO  - 

 

2 

3.56⋅1023e/cm3,  the  electron  density  of  20%  sucrose  solution  is  3.58⋅1023e/cm3.  But  the  glycerol 
influences  the  membrane  structure  and  at  0.5  molar  fraction  creates  the  interdigitated  phase  [17].  Our 
SANS  experiments  with  phospholipid  unilamellar  vesicles  in  the  DMSO/water  solutions  have 
demonstrated that starting from 0.1-0.15 molar DMSO fraction vesicles began to aggregate and create 
the multilamellar structures. So, neither glycerol nor DMSO can be used as a buffer media to study the 
vesicles structure by SAXS.  
 
The  second  important  question  to  be  clarified  is  the  sucrose  influence  on  the  multilamellar 
structure  of  DMPC.  The  DSC  curves  recorded  are  presented  in  Fig. 3.  The  first  endothermic  peak 
corresponds  to  the  transition  from  gel  Lβ′-phase  to  ripple  Pβ′-phase,  so-called  pretransition.  For  0% 
sucrose  concentration  the  peak  maximum  is  located  at  about  15oC.  The  second  endothermic  peak 
corresponds to the transition from ripple Pβ′-phase to liquid crystalline Lα-phase, so-called main phase 
transition.  The  onset  temperature  of  main  phase  transition  Tm=22.8oC  for  DMPC  in  pure  water.  The 
DSC results are presented in Table 2. The pretransition temperature is shifted towards the main phase 
transition  temperature  with  the  increase  of  sucrose  concentration.  The  enthalpy  of  the  main  phase 
transition does not change with the increase of sucrose concentration up to 40%. At 60% concentration 
the enthalpy decreases to the value of 6.0cal/g. It was measured by C. Fabrie that the enthalpy of DMPC 
main phase transition decreases linearly from the value of 8.1cal/g at 0% sucrose to the value of 7.3cal/g 
at 60% sucrose [11]. The value of the main phase transition temperature from our measurements is in 
good  agreement  with  C.  Fabrie’s  results.  In  the  interval  of  experimental  errors,  our  results  for  the 
enthalpy  of  the  main  phase  transition  are  in  the  agreement  with  results  of  C.  Fabrie  for  sucrose 
concentration from 0% to 40%, and are different at sucrose concentration 60%. The discrepancy in the 
values of enthalpy cause from the overlap of the signals from the pretransition and main phase transition 
at 60% sucrose.  
 
The SAXS and WAXS diffraction patterns were recorded with acquisition time of 1 min at the 
temperature  alteration  from  3oC  to  38oC.  It  allows  one  to  calculate  the  repeat  distance  of  DMPC 
membrane  as  a  function  of  temperature.  SAXS  and  WAXS  patterns  from  DMPC  multilamellar 
liposomes  are  presented  in  Figs. 4  and   5  for  0%,  20%,  40%,  60%  sucrose  at  T=10oC.  The  systems 
studied were in gel Lβ′-phase at this temperature. The thickness of the intermembrane solvent space was 
calculated as ds=d-dl. The value of dl was determined from SANS experiment with large unilamellar 
vesicles  as  described  in  [1,2,16].  Sucrose  has  no  influence  on  dl  so  it  has  a  permanent  value  of 
44.5±1.0Å  at  T=10oC.  The  addition  of  20%  sucrose  increases  ds  from  15.1±1.9Å  to  the  value  of 
20.4±2.0Å, which does not change much for higher sucrose concentrations, see Table 3.  

The WAXS diffraction from the hydrocarbon chains of DMPC molecules in Lβ′-phase (Fig. 5) 
demonstrates  that  the  packing  of  hydrocarbon  chains  has  a  permanent  structure  for  all  sucrose 
concentrations. The WAXS patterns exhibit sharp (2,0) reflection at q=1.496±0.003Å-1 and broad (1,2) 
shoulder  at  q=1.52±0.03Å-1  for  all  sucrose  concentrations.  These  reflections  correspond  to  the 
disordered  hexagonal  lattice,  which  can  be  represented  as  two-dimensional  rectangular  lattice 
(containing 4 hydrocarbon chain projections ) of dimensions a=8.40±0.17Å, b=9.49±0.28Å [18,4]. This 
lattice corresponds to an area per hydrocarbon chain Sch=19.9±1.0Å2. WAXS diffraction patterns in the 
ripple  phase  have  broad  diffraction  peak  at  q=1.50±0.03Å-1  (rectangular  lattice  with  a=8.38±0.17Å, 
b=9.67±0.19Å) for all sucrose concentrations. The area per hydrocarbon chain Sch=20.4±0.8Å2. In the 
liquid  crystalline  Lα-phase  the  diffraction  peak  becomes  broader  and  has  a  permanent  maximum  at 

 

3 

q=1.43±0.03Å-1 for all sucrose concentrations (rectangular lattice with a=8.80±0.18Å, b=10.16±0.21Å, 
Sch=22.4±0.9Å2). The increase in the area occupied by hydrocarbon chain projection on the membrane 
surface is a result of an increase in the hydration of polar head groups in the Lα-phase. Consequently, 
no influence of sucrose on the hydration of polar head groups was detected.  
The  main  result  from  WAXS  diffraction  is  that  the  packing  of  hydrocarbon  chains  is  not 
 
influenced  by  the  sucrose  in  all  studied  phases,  which  supports  the  conclusion  about  permanent 
membrane thickness in sucrose buffers from SAXS and SANS experiments. The present WAXS results 
are  in    agreement  with  WAXS  results  published  by  J.  Stumpel  in  [13]  for  the  liquid  crystalline  Lα-
phase,  but  are  different  for  the  case  of  Lβ′-phase.  J.  Stumpel  reported  that  the  spacing  between 
hydrocarbon chains is a function of sucrose concentration with minimal lattice at 30% sucrose. Above 
50% sucrose the WAXS diffraction peak becomes symmetrical, which was explained in terms of change 
in the tilt of hydrocarbon chains. Our results demonstrate that at 60% sucrose (see Fig. 5) peak has the 
same shoulder as at 0% sucrose concentration. 

The diffraction pattern for the  ripple Pβ′-phase consists of two types of peaks (see Fig. 6). The 
first type is the diffraction from multilamelar membrane structure, the first order sharp diffraction peak 
at  about  q=0.1Å-1  for  0%  sucrose.    The  second  type  is  the  diffraction  on  the  undulations  of  the 
membrane  surface,  the  first  order  peak  for  0%  sucrose  located  at  q=0.052±0.002  Å-1.  The  value  of 
undulation  length  dr  is  calculated  as  dr  =2π/q.  The  values  of  dr  are  120.8±3.6Å  for  sucrose 
concentration  0%,  120.8±3.6Å  for 20%  sucrose, and 128.5±7.7Å. for 40% sucrose,  i.e. the membrane 
undulation parameter has the same value for all sucrose concentration from 0% to 40%.  
The  diffraction  peaks  of  first  and  second  order  from  multilamellar  membrane  structure  in  the 
 
ripple phase consist of two slightly overlapping diffraction peaks. In Fig. 6 the peak splitting can be seen 
only  in  the  second  diffraction  peak  from  multilamellar  membrane  structure  for  0%  sucrose 
concentration.  The  peak  splitting  at  0%  sucrose  corresponds  to  the  values  of  d  64.6±1.0Å  and 
63.5±1.0Å. At the 20% sucrose two well distinguished diffraction peaks from multilamellar membrane 
structure  are  detected,  corresponding  to  the  values  of  d  74.8±1.1Å  and  68.3±1.0Å.  At  40%  sucrose 
concentration,  the  broad  diffraction  peak  corresponds  to  d=70.5±1.1Å.  The  diffraction  peak  position 
cannot  be  determined  at  sucrose  concentration  60%.  The  diffraction  intensity  decreases  due  to  the 
decrease in the number of layers in the multilamellar liposomes. This behavior is typical for all phases 
studied (see Figs. 4,6) and can explain the fact established by the SANS that vesicles in sucrose buffer 
are sufficiently stable in time compared to the pure water buffer. It is possible to say that sucrose posses 
weak surfactant properties.  

In the ripple phase, the value of d increases with the increase of sucrose concentration, as it is 
seen from comparing d values for sucrose concentrations 0%, 20%, 40%. No influence of sucrose on the 
membrane undulations and, consequently, on the membrane rigidity was found. 
 
In  the  liquid  crystalline  Lα-phase  (figures  not  shown),  the  diffraction  peak  from  multilamellar 
membrane structure with d=62.8±0.9Å at 0% sucrose and T=30oC is split up into two diffraction peaks. 
At  20%  sucrose  they  correspond  to  the  values  of  repeat  distances  61.0±0.9Å  and  68.3±1.0Å.  At  40% 
sucrose,  the difference in  the value of repeat  distances becomes smaller and harder to distinguish, the 
values of d are 62.2±0.9Å and 64.2±1.0Å at T=31oC. The peak splitting at 40% sucrose concentration 
was measured in Lα-phase for diluted system with concentration of DMPC 5% (w/w). Despite the very 
low  statistics,  the  splitting  of  diffraction  peak  was  detected.  The  membrane  exhibits  two  phase 
coexistence  with  lamellar  spacing  58.7±2.0Å  and  75.7±2.0Å.  The  two  phase  coexistence  was  not 

 

4 

detected by the measurements of J. Stumpel at T=35oC with very diluted system. The concentration of 
DMPC  was  0.5%  (w/w)  [13].  These  results  show  one  phase  with  increasing  repeat  distance  from 
62±0.5Å at 0% sucrose to 66.5±0.5Å at 14% sucrose and with further monotonous decrease to the value 
of 58.5±0.5Å at 60% sucrose.  

The  liquid  Lα-phase  of  DMPC  has  a  complex  structure  in  the  presence  of  sucrose,  which 
depends on the sucrose and DMPC concentrations in the buffer. The properties of multilamellar DMPC 
membranes in sucrose buffers cannot be explained as a simple penetration of sucrose molecules into the 
region  of  polar  head  groups.  There  are  strong  suggestions  in  the  literature  that  sucrose,  either  free  in 
solution  or  covalently  linked  to  membrane  surface,  can  also  affect  the  physical  properties  of  the 
membrane. Probably the sucrose influence on the membrane is not direct, at first sucrose influences the 
buffer  properties  and  through  that  the  membrane  [10].  Our  results  support  this  idea.  Sucrose  has  no 
influence on the membrane thickness of unilamellar vesicles, but has an influence on the polydispersity 
and vesicle radius. Sucrose molecules do not influence the mutual packing of hydrocarbon chains, but 
increase  the  main  phase  transition  temperature  and  influence  the  intermembrane  interaction  by 
increasing the repulsive forces.  

 
4. CONCLUSIONS 

As the result of complementary synchrotron and neutron scattering experiments, it is established 
that aqueous sucrose solutions: have no influence on the membrane thickness and the mutual packing of 
hydrocarbon chains; have an influence on the properties of phase transitions. The membrane thickness 
has a constant value in the  range of sucrose concentrations 0%-40% (44.5±1.0Å at T=10oC). Sucrose 
buffer  sufficiently  increases  X-ray  contrast  for  model  biological  membranes,  decreases  the  vesicles 
polydispersity, and increases the vesicles life-time. It gives a possibility to determine the average value 
of vesicles radius. 

Sucrose buffer in the range of concentrations 30%−40% is a perspective medium for the SAXS 
application to the investigation of the structure of vesicles and mixed lipid/surfactant aggregates. In this 
respect,  the  structural  synchrotron  investigations  of  phospholipid  based  drug  carriers  in  the  range  of 
vesicle sizes 500Å-1000Å have a special practical interest.

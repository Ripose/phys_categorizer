Abstract 
 
In  this  paper  we  pay  attention  to  the  inconsistency  in  the  derivation  of  the  symmetric 
electromagnetic  energy-momentum  tensor  for  a  system  of  charged  particles  from  its  canonical 
form, when the homogeneous Maxwell’s equations are applied to the symmetrizing gauge trans-
formation,  while  the  non-homogeneous  Maxwell’s  equations  are  used  to  obtain  the  motional 
equation.  Applying  the  appropriate  non-homogeneous  Maxwell’s  equation  to  both  operations, 
we  have  revealed  an  additional  symmetric  term  in  the  tensor,  named  as  “compensating  term”. 
Analyzing  the  structure  of  this  “compensating  term”,  we  suggested  a  method  of  “gauge  renor-
malization”, which allows transforming the divergent terms of classical electrodynamics (infinite 
self-force,  self-energy  and  self-momentum)  to  converging  integrals.  The  motional  equation  ob-
tained for a non-radiating charged particle does not contain its self-force, and the mass parameter 
includes the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic masses. The motional equation for a radiat-
ing particle also contains the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic masses, and does not yield 
any “runaway solutions”. It has been shown that the energy flux in a free electromagnetic field is 
guided by the Poynting vector, whereas the energy flux in a bound EM field is described by the 
generalized Umov’s vector, defined in the paper. The problem of “Poincaré stresses” is also ex-
amined. It has been shown that the presence of the “compensating term” in the electromagnetic 
energy-momentum  tensor  allows  a  solution  of  the  “4/3  problem”,  where  the  total  observable 
mass  of  the  electron  is  completely  determined  by  the  Poincaré  stresses  and  hence  the  conven-
tional relativistic relationship between the energy and momentum is recovered.

1. Introduction 
 
The  problem  of  infinite  electromagnetic  (EM)  mass  of  the  electron  and  self-forces  of  charged 
particles has continued to be one of the central issues of classical electrodynamics during more 
than a century [1-8]. One of the reasons, explaining such a great attention to these problems, is 
their persistence in quantum electrodynamics [9, 10]. The simplest method to avoid the infinite 
EM  mass  of  an  electron  is  to  add  a  compensating  infinite  negative  mass.  However,  such  a 
method  does  not  overcome  all  difficulties  of  classical  electrodynamics,  in  particular,  the  “run-
away solutions” (e.g., a “self-acceleration” of radiating electron). In addition, the total self-force 
of  the  electron  includes  its  non-radiative  and  radiative  parts,  and  the  first  of  these  is  infinite. 
However, we cannot simply cancel the infinite self-action, because this inevitably would negate 
a radiative reaction observed experimentally. In the present paper we omit a detailed review of 
these problems, referring to the mentioned references [1-11], insofar as we will apply a primary 
modification  of  the  energy-momentum  tensor  to  remove  an  inconsistency,  which  seems  not  to 
have been revealed before. 

It is known (see, e.g. [5, 6]) that the motional equation for an EM field with the Lagran-

 gives the following expression for the canonical energy-momentum

Usually the divergences of Eqs. (13) and (14) for a single isolated particle are related to 
the intrinsic inconsistency of classical EM theory, and they are overcome by the standard renor-
malization technique, mentioned above. 
 
In this paper we intend to resolve the problems of self-action and infinite self-energy in 
classical  electrodynamics,  applying  a  procedure  of  renormalization  of  the  energy-momentum 
tensor under its proper gauge transformation.  
First of all we pay attention to a lack of logic in the derivation of Eq. (5) and further cal-
 
culation of the four-divergence of  mnT
. Namely, under the gauge transformation from Eq. (1) to 
Eq. (5) the homogeneous Maxwell equation (6) was used, while in proving the equality (11) the 
non-homogeneous Maxwell equation (10) was used. Thus, two different equations, (6) and (10), 
have  been  applied  to  the  same  physical  entity,  the  electromagnetic  energy-momentum  tensor. 
Then  it  remains  unclear  whether  this  tensor  describes  free  EM  fields  (as  assumed  in [5]), or is 
valid in the general case (as assumed in [6]). The revealed inconsistency prompts a closer look at 
the  procedure  of  symmetrization  of  EM  tensor,  which  is  done  in  section  2.  As  a  result  of  this 
analysis, a method of “gauge renormalization” is suggested. In section 3 we explore the motional 
equation and the energy-momentum conservation law in classical electrodynamics, obtained af-
ter the “gauge renormalization”. In addition, a possible resolution of the problems of “4/3” and 
infinite self-energy of electron has been proposed. Finally, section 4 presents some conclusions. 
 
 
2. The electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor for a system of charged particles and its 
“gauge renormalization”

sents the sum of corresponding tensors

Outside the charged particle its charge density is identically equal to zero, and both terms in lhs of

A vagueness of these quantities means the impossibility of determining the total energy and momen-
tum of the EM field of a single particle.  
 
Under  these  conditions  we  can  carry  out  a  suitable  gauge  modification  of  the  EEM  tensor 
(26), in order to escape the mentioned shortcomings. This mathematical problem can be much more 
easily solved physically, if we introduce a new tensor satisfying the conservation law (32). Namely, 
let us use a natural assumption that the total mass of a charged particle Mt is composed from its me-
chanical mass M and the mass MEM of its EM field. Denoting as m and mEM the corresponding rest 
mass densities, we transform the matter tensor (7) to the form 

.  Owing  to  the  law  of  charge  conservation,  the 
where  for  an  isolated  charged  particle 
0=
mechanical mass cannot be transformed into EM mass and vice versa. Therefore, the vanished four-
divergence is derived independently for the mechanical and EM parts of the tensor (40), and

1 We underline that this gauge operation would be impossible, if the compensating term (21) were not added to the 
EEM tensor (26). Indeed, without the term (21) the trace of the EEM tensor (26) would be equal to zero, while the 

trace  of  tensor  of  EM  mass  (42)  is  not  vanishing.  Hence  in  no  way can the two tensors

 be 

connected  by  the  gauge  transformation  (2).  One  can  also  see  that  without  the  compensating  term  (21)  Eq.  (32)  is 
reduced to Eqs. (36) and (37), which are not zero. The artificial requirement to exclude the terms of self-action and

These equations state that the difference of two divergent integrals in their rhs must be finite and 
equal  to  the  EM  mass  of  particle  (Eq.  (46))  and  EM  momentum  of  particle  (Eq.  (47)).  Such 
statements  are  sufficient  for  further  development  of  classical  theory.  Nevertheless,  it  seems  in-
teresting to extend a classical analysis of Eqs. (46), (47) to rﬁ0. This will be done below in sub-
section 3.5 in relation to the “Poincaré stresses”. 

Thus,  the  obtained  tensor  (43)  contains  single-valued  quantities  and  does  not  include  a 
self-action  of  charged  particles  due  to  Eq.  (24).  The  method  proposed  in  this  section  can  be 
termed a “gauge renormalization”. We have to emphasize that this method has been applied to a 
bound  EM  field of a non-radiating isolated charged particle. If a particle moves in the external 
EM  fields,  and  its  EM  radiation  is  not  negligible,  we  have  to  proceed  from  the  general  tensor 
(25) for description of its EM field. Then the total energy-momentum tensor acquires the form

When radiation is negligible, the tensor (50) identically coincides with the EEM tensor (26), de-
fined above. 

In the next section we analyze some important physical consequences, resulting from the 
application of the tensor (48) and its particular form (43) to radiating and non-radiating charged 
particles. But now we would like to pay attention to a principal implication of Eqs. (48), (43). It 
is  known  that  the  Einstein  equation  establishes  proportionality  between  the  scalar  curvature  of 
space R and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor T [12]:

where

equal to zero, even if the matter tensor is excluded. Hence we conclude that EM fields influence 
the scalar curvature of space-time via the EM masses.

Eq.  (55)  has  two  essential  differences  from  the  conventional  motional  equation  (12).  First  it 
shows that a particle experiences the forces only due to the external EM fields, and a self-action 
is impossible. This result reflects our original exclusion of self-action from the electromagnetic 
energy-momentum tensor under the “gauge renormalization”. Secondly, the EM mass of the par-
ticle is explicitly added to its mechanical mass. Of course, the idea to include the EM mass in the 
total mass of charged particles is as old as the classical model of the electron. However, it seems 
that this idea was usually forgotten, when the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor and the 
motional  equation  were  derived.  The  continuity  equation  (54)  is common for both masses, and 
EMM   to  the  total  mass 
hence  it  is  impossible  to  determine  the  relative  contribution  of  M  and 
within classical electrodynamics. We emphasize that Mt is defined in the rest frame of the parti-
cle. Eq. (55) shows that M, 
 have the identical relativistic dependence 
+
on the velocity of the particle. 
 
Thus, we see that the introduction of a compensating term (21) into the electromagnetic 
energy-momentum  tensor  and  further  “gauge  renormalization”  remove  any  terms  of  self-action 
from the motional equation (55) without any changes in the Lorentz force law. In the next sec-
tion we will show that for a radiating charged particle the compensating tensor (21) gives an ex-
tra-term in the Lorentz force law, which excludes any “self-acceleration” of radiating particles.

3.2. Motional equation for a radiating charged particle 
 
When a particle radiates, we have to use the tensor (48) to get its motional equation. Let us as-
sume  that  the  external  EM  field,  where  the  particle  is  accelerated,  is  described  by  the  tensor  mnh
. 
Then combining Eqs. (48)-(51), taking account of Eq. (24), we obtain for this particle:

This equation shows that the component of

 are reduced by the 
factor  g1 . Such behaviour of the force of radiation reaction completely agrees with the relativistic 
law of force transformation [12]. The total instantaneous force of radiation reaction is found by inte-

Thus, the work done due to the force of radiation reaction properly changes the kinetic energy of the 
radiating particle. 

At  the same time, we have to emphasize that Eq. (60) does not determine the total average 
force, acting on a radiating charged particle, and Eq. (62) does not determine the total average work 
done by the radiation reaction. In order to find this total average force explicitly, we have to derive

3.3. Energy flux in free and bound electromagnetic fields 
 
First consider a free EM field in the absence of charged particles. Then the electromagnetic en-
ergy-momentum tensor (48) takes its usual form (5), and the equality

where  the  Poynting  vector  S
  is  given  by  Eq.  (16).  If  the  EM  radiation  falls  on  a  system  of 
charged particles, then the latter equation transforms to Eq. (14). This equation has a reasonable 
(cid:1)
physical  explanation:  the  direction  of  S
  coincides  with  that  of  EM  wave  propagation,  and  the 
term 
 corresponds to absorption of EM radiation by charged particles. The same Eq. (14) is 
also customarily applied to a non-radiating EM field, where it leads to the appearance of a term 
of self-action, Eq. (14).

The obtained Eq. (66) does not yet determine the total flow of energy in a bound EM field, be-
cause the flow of EM masses should be added. As we mentioned above, due to the fixed ratio of

ance equation (14) for free EM field, the term 
 does not appear for the bound fields. Inas-
much as Eq. (72) represents the sum of Eqs. (70), (71), it incorporates two different effects: the 
flow of EM masses of all individual particles, as well as the superposition of bound EM fields of 
the particles. 
 
Eq. (72) was first obtained in ref. [13] as a formal solution of Maxwell’s equations. How-
ever,  the  physical  meaning  of  this  equation  was  not  clarified.  We  notice  that  in  the  particular 
case,  where  the  instantaneous  velocities of all particles are equal to each other (
=  for any 
k), Eq. (72) acquires the form

This equation shows that the resultant EM field rigidly moves together with the source particles. 
It seems interesting that each individual particle carries its EM mass independently of other par-
ticles,  but  the  superposition  of  bound  EM  fields  from  all  particles  transforms  the  sum  of  these 
individual motions into a common motion of the resultant bound EM field at the same velocity

 was first introduced by Umov in fluid mechanics more than one century 
v

. The vector

ago [14]. Hence we can name the vector (73) as the generalized Umov’s vector, which describes 
the energy fluxes in the system of charged particles, moving at different velocities. 
 
Thus, the energy balance equation resulting from the total energy-momentum tensor (43) 
for a bound EM field completely differs from the Poynting expression both in form and physical 
interpretation.  The  scientific  literature  on  classical  EM  theory  contains  numerous  problems 
where the energy fluxes in non-radiative EM fields, guided by the Poynting vector, give strange 
physical  pictures.  But  what  is  more  important,  there  are  problems,  hitherto  ignored,  where  the 
Poynting vector totally fails to describe the energy flux in a bound EM field. For example, con-
sider the motion of a charged parallel plate capacitor in the direction normal to the plates (Fig. 
aa · , where a>>d, d being the distance between the plates. 
1). The square plates have the size

the  electric  field  rigidly  moves  together  with  the  plates.  However,  in  no  way  can  this  result  be 
understood with the Poynting vector. Indeed, in this space region

is no energy flux inside the capacitor in the Poynting sense. Thus, only Eq. (72) adequately de-
scribes the energy flux inside the capacitor, where the EM field rigidly moves with the plates.

Let us show that this result complies with the finite (light) velocity of propagation of the 
EM field. It is known that the expression for an electric and magnetic field of a moving particle 
contains  two  parts:  the velocity-dependent term and acceleration-dependent term. The velocity-
dependent term can be written in “present time coordinates”, which yield the Heaviside ellipsoid 
[6-8]. In such “present time coordinates” the bound EM field rigidly propagates together with the 
moving source particle. We see that the generalized Umov’s vector gives the same result, when 
applied to a single charged particle.  

The results obtained in this sub-section indicate that free and bound EM fields have sub-
stantially  different  physical  properties.  It  warrants  their  primary  distinction  in  the  original  en-
ergy-momentum tensor (48).

It  consists  of  two  parts:  the  momentum  density,  associated  with  the  EM  mass of charged particles, 
and the momentum density, resulting from the superposition of EM fields of different particles. Be-
fore considering the forces and mutual transformation of mechanical and EM momentum in systems 
of charged particles, we emphasize that the first term in rhs of Eq. (76) represents a contribution of 
EM momentum of the particle, associated with its EM mass, to the total momentum of that particle. 
Therefore, the time rate of the first term in rhs of Eq. (77) is rather the consequence than the cause of 
the force experienced by the particle. Hence the external forces, acting on charged particles, are de-
termined by the time rate of the second term in rhs of Eq. (77).  

Let  us consider an isolated system, consisting of two non-radiating charged particles q1 and 
q2, and determine a total force exerted on this system. In general, it does not vanish, owing to viola-
tion of Newton’s third law in EM interactions. Adding the mechanical momenta of both particles to 
Eq. (77), we obtain

Now consider stationary EM systems, where the problem of mutual transformation between 
mechanical and EM momentum was explored at both theoretical and experimental levels (see, e.g., 
[16-18]).  Such  systems  are  presented  fundamentally  as  an  electrically  neutral  magnetic  dipole  with 
(cid:1)
the moment m
 and a resting charged particle q. The EM momentum density of this system is propor-
,  where  both  fields  are  necessarily  taken  from  the  different 
tional  to  the  vector  product 
sources. Hence the total EM momentum of the system is the same under the conventional Poynting’s 
approach and within classical electrodynamics after the gauge renormalization.

mally eliminated in Eq. (82). It does not mean that the problem is resolved: it is simply relocated from 
Eq. (82) into Eqs. (46) and (47). It reflects the obvious fact that any gauge operation does not change 
the total energy of charged particles, which includes the energy that provides the stability of the elec-
tron (“Poincaré stresses” [19]). The following subsection is devoted to closer classical analysis of this 
problem with Eqs. (46) and (47), obtained under the “gauge renormalization”. 
 
3.5. Proper mass of electron and “Poincaré stresses” 
 
In section 2 we mentioned that a finiteness of the electromagnetic mass of the electron could result as 
the difference of two divergent integrals in Eq. (46). Note that the second term in rhs of Eq. (46) has 
a negative sign. This fact already displays a presence of some non-electromagnetic forces, such as the 
“Poincaré stresses”: otherwise (for positive sign of both terms in rhs of Eq. (46)), the stability of the 
electron  would  be  impossible.  Nevertheless,  we  continue  the  classical  analysis of this equation and 
assume the conventional expressions for the scalar potential and electric field,  
rq=j
 
 
correspondingly, in the spatial region where the change density of the electron r can be taken equal 
to zero. At distances r<rb from the “center of electron” (rb is some boundary value) the charge den-
sity is not zero, and we cannot adopt Eqs. (83), (84). Hence in the non-relativistic limit

We see that for n=-3 (

=r

), both masses are vanished: ME=MM=02. This result could 

mean that the total observable mass of electron is not electromagnetic in nature, and determined by 
its mechanical mass and the energy of the stresses of Poincaré. It resolves the problem of “4/3”, be-
cause  the  non-electromagnetic  masses and momenta are related by the conventional relativistic for-

mula.  We  cannot  even  exclude  that  the  “Poincaré  stresses”  are  completely  responsible  for  the  ob-
servable electron’s mass. In addition, both masses ME, MM vanish at any rb, including the limit rbﬁ0 
(“point-like” elementary particle). Of course, the designated problems lie beyond the limit of validity 
of classical physics. Nevertheless, the choice n=-3 in Eqs. (89), (90) gives a possible classical resolu-
tion of the problem “4/3”, which was originally formulated within classical physics, too.

We  underline  that  the  vanishing  of  the  electron’s  EM  mass  results  from  the  equality  of 
,  integrating  over  the  whole  space,  and  the  “potential  energy” 

EM  energy 
(cid:14)
dVrj ,  integrating  over  the  “inner  volume”  of  the  electron.  Therefore,  in  the  outer  (with  re-
spect  to  the  electron)  space,  where r=0, the mass density is equal to u/c2 as before, where u is 
given by Eq. (15). Hence there is no need to re-define the parameters of mass density m, mEM in 
the energy-momentum tensors (43) and (48), even if the sum m+mEM is exactly equal to the mass 
of “Poincaré stresses”.  
 
 
4. Conclusions 
 

1.  In  this  paper  we  have  removed  the  inconsistency  that  existed  up  to  now  in  classical 
electrodynamics. Namely, in the gauge transformation of canonical energy-momentum (1) to the 
symmetric form, we applied the non-homogeneous Maxwell equation (10) instead of the irrele-
vant  homogeneous  equation  (6).  As  a  result,  the  symmetric  “generalized”  energy-momentum 
tensor  acquired  the  additional  “compensating  term”  (21).  The  presence  of  that  “compensating 
term” allows a gauge transformation, converting the divergent terms of classical electrodynamics 
(infinite self-force, self-energy and self-momentum) to converging integrals. This operation was 
named as “gauge renormalization”.  

2. The obtained energy-momentum tensor (48) with its particular form (43) for a bound 
EM  field  has  been  applied  to  the  fundamental  problems  of  classical  electrodynamics:  the  mo-
tional equation, the energy balance equation, and the momentum conservation law for the system 
of moving charged particle.  

The motional equation for a non-radiating charged particle does not contain its self-force, 
and the mass parameter represents the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic masses. The mo-
tional equation for a radiating particle also contains the sum of mechanical and electromagnetic 
masses, and does not yield any “runaway solutions”.  

The energy flux in a free EM field is guided by the Poynting vector. The energy flux in a 
bound  EM  field  is  described  by  the  generalized  Umov  vector, defined in the paper. This result 
shows that free and bound EM fields have substantially different physical properties, which war-
rant their primary distinction in the energy-momentum tensor (48).  

3. According to the “gauge renormalization”, a relationship between the mass density and 
the momentum density of a bound EM field has the conventional relativistic form, whereas the 
problem of “Poincaré stresses” is relocated to the converging integrals, which determine the total 
EM mass and momentum of a charged particle (Eqs. (46), (47)). At the classical level, these in-
( )rr  in the “inner volume” of electron. It has 
tegrals depend on the charge density distribution 
( )rr  allows making zero both masses ME 
been shown that variation of the shape of the function 
and MM simultaneously. In this case the total mass of electron has a non-electromagnetic origin 
and as a limiting case, it could be fully ascribed to the energy of Poincaré stresses. For such non-
electromagnetic mass the problem of “4/3” disappears.

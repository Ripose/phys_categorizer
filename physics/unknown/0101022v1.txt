Abstract
The effect of solute, sodium deoxycholate bile salt (DOCNa), on the cooperativity of ordered-
fluid, fosfolipid phase transition has been investigated by determining of the transition widths in
multibilayer dispersions of the dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)-DOCNa mixtures. The
∆T1/2 values were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The van’t Hoff values of the
main  transition  enthalpies  were  calculated  using  an  approximative  expression  deduced  from
Zimm  and  Bragg  theory  [Sturtevant,J.M.(1982),  Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.USA,79:3963-3967].  The
bile salt decreases the cooperativity (size of cooperative unit) of DPPC bilayers.

Introduction

Phenomenological theories of the cooperativity of phase transitions have been formulated on

the basis of coexisting cluster of lipid molecules, characteristic of the different phases, at the

phase transition. The Zimm and Bragg theory of cooperative phase transitions supposes that

during the transition there different states of lipid. Considering three states, ordered, fluid and
interfacial  states  [Marsh,1976,  cit.in  Marsh,1977],  the  degree  of  transition,  θ,  i.e.  mean

fraction of molecules in the fluid state, is:

where s is the  statistical  weight  for the state above  the  transition and  σ  is  the  cooperativity

parameter.  The  values  of  s  and  σ  are  related  with  the  free  energies  of  fluid  and  interfacial

states by the arrhenian exponentials:

s = exp (∆St /R) exp (-∆Ht /RT)
σ = exp (Si /R) exp (-Hi /RT)

where ∆Ht and ∆St are calorimetric transition enthalpy and entropy, respectively. Hi and Si are

interfacial enthalpy and entropy, respectively.

Cooperativity  arises  from  interfacial  free  energy,  Gi  =  Hi  –  TSi.  The  chain-melting

transitions  of  saturated  phosphatidylcholines  are  highly  cooperative  [Marsh,1991]  so  that  it

becomes indistinguishable from a first-order, discontinuous transition [Lee,1977].

Differentiating eqn. (1):
 dθ   =  1     ∆Ht
 dT   T t 4 σ  RTt

2

shows that θ  will have a linear dependence on 1/T around the transition temperature, Tt, with
a negative slope from which σ may be determined. The values of θ were calculated from the

ESR and rectangular light-scattering measurements [Marsh,1977].

If  the  ordered-fluid  transition  is  considered  as  a  pseudo-unimolecular  reaction  with
equilibrium constant Kt = θ /(1-θ), eqn. (2) can be transformed into the van’t Hoff (vH) form:

(5)

Equalization member to member of eqns. (4) and (5) produces:
σ = (∆Ht / ∆HvH)2
The  smaller  the  value of  σ,  the  greater  the  cooperativity  of  transition.  The  quantity

(6)

n=1/σ is referred to as the size of the cooperative unit and is directly related to the domain

size,  being  equal  to  the  mean  number  of  lipids  per  interfacial  lipid  within  a  domain  at  the

centre  of  the  transition.  The  pH-dependence  of  the  phase  transition  of  DMPA  has  been

investigated  using  DSC  [Blume,1979].  The  high  cooperativity  at  pH  3.5  indicated  that  a

tightly packed structure is formed, which increases the size of the cooperative unit.

A matter of large interest was the influence of small molecules, as anesthetics, on the

thermodynamic  parameters  of  thermotropic  behaviour  of  saturated  phosphatidylcholines.

Procaine  reduces  the  cooperativity  of  the  main  phase  transition  of  DMPC  bilayers

[Tsong,1977] and a cluster model suggests that the anesthetic reduces the average size of the

lipid clusters.

If the lipid molecules in the bilayers would be perfectly ordered the transition would

be  isotermal.  However,  there  are  many  limitations  generated  by  experimental  conditions

which  lead  to  the  extension  of  observed  transitions  over  finite  ranges  of  temperature.  The

reasons of this broadening can be the imperfect ordering of the lipid molecules in the bilayer,

finite scan rates and calorimetric lags, and the presence of traces of impurities.

The experimental DSC curve is the temperature rate of heat absorption, equivalent to

the excess heat capacity function, Cex, given by eqn.:

Cex = ∆Ht dθ /dT

The sharpness of the Cex peak of main phase transition emphasizes the cooperativity

of it. The apex of the curve corresponds to transition temperature, Tt, and to maximal value of

Cex, Cex,max:

(7)

(8)

With  certain  assumptions  was  developed  [Mastrangelo,1955  cit.in  Sturtevant,1982]

an  expression  for  the  broadening  of  the  main  transition  of  a  pure  lipid  caused  by  a  solute

forming  ideal  solutions  in  both  gel  and  fluid  phases.  During  the  phase  transition,  the

equilibrium in distribution of solute between the lipid phases is maintained. This equilibrium

and  the  partitioning  of  solute  between  aqueous  and  lipid  phases  do  not  change  appreciably

within the temperature range of the transition. The bilayer behaves as a isotropic solvent. In
these conditions the eqn. (4) in eqn. (8) may be substituted; resulting a relation between ∆ HvH
and ∆Ht for a “pure” lipid:

Cex,max = ∆Ht∆HvH /4RT0

2

(9)

Here T0 is the temperature at which the phase transition of the “pure” lipid (lipid containing

no added solute) is half completed.
∆HvH may be expressed by less exact formulae, derived from eqn. (  ):

∆HvH ≈ 6.9 T0

2 /∆T1/2

(10)

where ∆T1/2 is the width (in degrees) at half-height of the transition. ∆T1/2 is related to both the

cooperative nature of the transition and the purity of the system. Presence in the bilayers of

impurities or solute molecules reduces lipid-lipid interactions and, consequently, reduces the

cooperativity of phase transitions.

Chemicals

Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine(DPPC)  was  purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.

DPPC  was  shown  to  be  pure  by  thin-layer  chromatography  on  Silicagel  using  a  solvent

system  of  chloroform:  methanol:water  (65:25:4;  v/v)  with  iodine  staining.  DOCNa  was

purchased from Merck and TRIS was purchased from Austranal. Both compounds were used

without further purification. Organic solvents were of analytical grade. Double-distilled water

(glass still) was used to make all samples.

Solutions, dispersions and calorimetric measurements

The  synthetic  lipid  DPPC  and  the  bile  salt  DOCNa  were  solved  at  different  molar
ratios in  0.3  ml  ethanol at  20°C  (Table  1). The  evaporation of  the  solvent  was  made  under

nitrogen  stream.  MLV  solutions  were  obtained  by  hydration  with  40µl  Tris-Cl  0.05M,

pH=7.2.  The  samples  were  subjected  to  DSC  analysis,  with  calorimeter  type  Du  Pont
Instruments at 5°C/min heating speed. The temperatures of phase transitions and the transition
width,∆T1/2  are shown in Table 1.

Starting  from  ethanolic  solutions  of  DPPC  and  DOCNa  respectively,  which  were

mixed  at  different  molar  ratio,  there  were  prepared  dry  films  having  the  compositions

specified in Table 2. Hydration of these films was made by vortexing with a buffer  Tris-Cl

0.01M,  pH=7.4  at  a  0.66mg  lipid  concentration,  after  which  the  MLV-DPPC-DOCNa

suspensions  were  left  at  rest  overnight.  DSC  measurements  with  calorimeter  type  VP-DSC

model MN2State produced thermograms whose thermodynamic caracteristics are mentioned

in Table 2.

As it can be observed in Table 1 DOCNa has strong effect on the caloric peak of the

main  phase transition.  DOCNa  significantly  decreases  Tm  value,  proportionally  to  its  molar

fraction. The decrease of Tm value is about 5 degrees in case DPPC:DOCNa=2:1 suggests that
solid  solutions  play  an  important  role  in  this  system.  A  major  increase  of  ∆T1/2  can  be

observed as a result of the decrease of phase transition cooperativity.That is determined by the

penetration  of  DOCNa  molecules  in  phospholipid  bilayers,  determining  the  decrease  of  the

van der Waals interactions.

DOCNa  abolishes  the  caloric  effect  of  the  pretransition.  At  a  DPPC:DOCNa  1:2  ratio,  the

caloric  effect  of  the  phase  transition  can  be  no  longer  emphasized,  probably  due  to  the

solubilisation of phospholipid vesicles.

The  values  of  Tp  and  Tm  decrease  and  the  values  of  ∆Hp  and  ∆Hm  increase  up  to  the  dry

mixture molar ratio no.3. The system produced by hydration of the mixture no.4 is probably
in micellar phase. The ∆T1/2 value also indicate a destabilization of the lamellar phase in the

case  of  suspension  no.4.  This  micellisation  phenomenon  takes  place  in  the  course  of

absorption  in  the  digestive  tube  a  process  which  is  favoured  by  bile  salts.  Mixed  micelles

mediate the intestinal absorption of some products of lipid digestion.

The values of the cooperativity parameter, σ and the sise of the cooperative  unit of

the main phase transition of DPPC-DOCNa systems, CU, are included in Table 3. The van’t
Hoff enthalpy, ∆HvH, was calculated with an equation (10) and the calorimetric enthalpy, ∆Ht,

was measured both with DSC Du Pont Instruments and with VP-DSC type MN2State.

The  cooperativity  parameter  is  a  square  ratio  of  measured  calorimetric  enthalpy  and

calculated enthalpy (eqn.6).:

The size of the cooperative unit (CU) is calculated on the basis of the equation:

CU = 1/√σ

(13)

The values presented in Table 3 show the decrease of main phase transition cooperativity of

the  DPPC-DOCNa  bilayers  directly  proportional  to  the  increase  of  the  surfactant

concentration amount.

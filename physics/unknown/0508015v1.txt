Abstract: We studied the optical properties of a dielectric photonic crystal 
structure with spirals arranged in a hexagonal lattice. The dielectric constant 
of the material is 9 and the filling ratio is 15.2%. We found that this kind of 
structure exhibits a significant polarization gap for light incident along the 
axis  of  the  spirals.  The  eigenmodes  inside  the  polarization  gap  are 
right-hand  (left-hand)  circularly  polarized  depending  on  the  whether  the 
spirals are left-handed (right-handed). The transmission spectrum of a slab 
of such a structure has been calculated and matches well  with the analysis 
of the eigenmodes.

Spiral  is  a  kind  of  three-dimensional  structure  that  has  chiral  character.  This  kind  of 
structure attracts attention because of its optical activity [1] and its geometric resemblance to 
the diamond structure [2]. Recent studies by [3,4] also showed that spiral-structured photonic 
crystals  process  complete  photonic  bandgaps  and  they  are  also  candidates  for  negative 
refraction  materials  [5].  A  few  innovative  techniques  have  successfully  fabricated  various 
forms  of  spiral  structures  in  the  micron  and  sub-micron  scale,  and  examples  including 
glancing 
and 
holography-lithography [8]. We also find by computer simulations that there are at least two 
ways to produce a periodic array of separated hollow spiral structures (spring-like structure) 
by  the  holographic  lithography  method.  Spring-like  spiral  structures  containing  metallic

nano-Ag  can  also  be  made  by  two-photon  writing  processes  [7].  The  spirals  fabricated  by 
holographic lithography are separated and hence their properties are expected to be different 
from those in [3]. The purpose of this paper is to examine the band structure and transmission 
properties  of  a  periodic  array  of  spirals  and  show  that  they  possess  significant  polarization 
gaps in which one circular polarization is forbidden inside the photonic crystal. 

All the band structures in this paper were calculated by the plane-wave expansion method. 
We used 2000×2000 matrices and doubling the matrix size shows no observable differences. 
The transmission spectra are calculated by the scattering matrix method SMM[9,10].   

The  plane  wave  method  was  first  used  to  study  the  spiral  structure  of  Toader  et.  al. [3] 
and our band structure results how a perfect match with those in [3]. The spiral structure (with 
ε=11.9) fabricated by the GLAD method exhibits robust photonic gaps, but we what to know 
whether  the  spiral  geometry  can  result  in  a  polarization  gap,  meaning  that  it  permits  the 
transmission of one circular polarization but rejects the other handedness in some frequencies. 
The  transmission  calculation  for  light  incident  along  the  Γ  to  Z  direction  for  circularly 
polarized light for the Toader structure is shown in Fig. 1. Although the basic building block 
of  their  structure  is  spiral,  the  transmittance  for  right  and  left  circularly  polarized  light  are 
almost  the  same.  The  weak  chiral  character  is  probably  because  the  spirals  are  strongly 
overlapping.

We  found  that  well-separated  spirals  exhibit  much  stronger  chiral  character.  Such 
geometrical  structures  can  in  fact  be  made  using  holographic  lithography  techniques.  For 
example,  a  7-beam  configuration  with  6  equally-spaced  circumpolar  linear  polarized  side 
beams  and  a  circular  polarized  central  beam  will  interfere  to  form  spirals  that  are  separated 
and form a hexagonal periodic array in the x-y plane. This class of structure has been realized 
experimentally  [11].  The  band  structure  was  then  calculated  for  a  structure  consisting  of 
right-hand spirals shown in Fig.2, which is an idealized structure derived from the one made 
by 7 beam laser interference with one of them being circularly polarized. We focus on the ΓA 
direction  which  is  parallel  to  the  spiral  axis  (equivalent  to  the  ΓZ  direction  in  the  previous 
case).  The  major  difference  between  the  one  shown  in  Fig.  2  and  the  one  used  in  [3]  is  the 
connectedness between the spirals. Spirals in the structure shown in Fig. 2 are separated and 
will a smaller the filling ratio of 15.2% than the one considered in [3]. 

 

Fig. 2. A schematic diagram of the spiral sturcuture. (a) is the side view and (b) is the top view 
of  the  array.  The  ΓA  direction  is  the  z  axis.  The  spiral  has  a  dielectric  constant  ε  =  9.  The 
filling ratio of the structure is 15.17 %.     
 

 

The  band  structure  of  the  spiral  structure  and  the  corresponding  transmission  spectrum 
through a stack of 16 layers are shown in Fig. 3. For the SMM calculation, each unit cell is 
divided into 32 sub-layers in the z direction. We found a sizable polarization gap in the band 
structure  (Fig.  3c)  and  the  polarization  gap  width  to  the  middle  gap  ratio  is  26.40%. 
Experimentally, the isolated spirals are kept in place by dielectric plates above and below [11]. 
Alternatively,  thin  horizontal  plates  can  be  added  in  the  structure  in  each  unit  cell  and  the 
effects of adding these thin plates (thickness = 3a/128), where a is the pitch of the spiral in the 
z-direction  on  the  band  structure  is  shown  in  Fig.  3d.  The  effect  of  these  thin  plates  on  the 
polarization gap is very small. From the transmission calculated for circular polarized light in 
Fig  3(a)  and  (b),  we  can  deduce  that  the  eigenmode  inside  the  polarization  gap  is  left-hand 
circular  polarized.  Here,  we  adopt  the  following  geometrical  definition  of  the  circularly 
polarized light. At any fixed instant of time, if the tip of the electric field of a plane wave trace 
out a right-handed helix in space, the plane wave is said to be right-hand circularly polarized 
and  vice  versa.  This  definition  will  make  it  easier  to  understand  the  physics  behind  the 
polarization  gap  since  the  polarization  gap  is  produced  by  the  spatial  variation  of  the  spiral 
structures.  We  note  that  various  chiral  structures  leading  to  some  form  of  polarization  gaps 
have  also  been  realized  experimentally  using  vacuum-deposition  [12]  and  liquid  crystal 
structures [13, 14].

The properties of the eigenmode inside the polarization gap can also be characterized by 
examining  the  field  patterns.  Before  making  the  characterization,  the  dominant  Fourier 
component  of  the  Bloch  wave  was  identified.  Fig.  4  shows  the  magnitude  of  the  Fourier 
components (k+G) for the Bloch modes in the ΓA direction. The radius of the open circle is 
proportional to the magnitude of the plane-wave component in the eigenmode. It shows that 
the  band  folding  at  the  Brillouin  zone  edge  is  very  weak  and  the  wave  travels  with  positive 
group  velocity  up  to  about  ωa/c=0.7  since  the  scattering  power  of  the  spirals  are  not  strong 
enough  to  make  the  scattered  wave  dominant  in  the  ΓA  direction.  Therefore,  it  is  more 
instructive to discuss the dispersion in an extended-zone scheme.

continuous  spirals  and  (b)  is  for  the  structure  with  thin  plates  inserted  in  each  pitch.  Bragg 
scattering  is  barely  observable  in  (a).  Band  “a”  and  “b”  are  marked  by  circles  and  crosses, 
respectively. 

The eigenmodes are analyzed in two ways. We first consider the ratio

  where  the 

spatial  average 

...

  is  taken  inside  a  unit  cell.  This  method  gives  a  good  effective 

representation  for  low  frequency  eigenmodes  where  the  mode  structure  is  simple.  The  real 
parts of  the  ratios  are  shown in Fig. 5. The imaginary is  very  small in this frequency range. 
The  results  show  for  the  right-handed  spiral  structure  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  band  “a”  is 
right-hand,  while  band  “b”  is  left-hand  polarized,  and  the  eigenmode  inside  the  polarization 
gap is left-hand circularly polarized, consistent with transmission calculations.

structure of Fig. 2. The ratio is expected to be 1 (-1) for right (left) hand circularly polarized 
wave. 
 

The  second  way  to  do  the  characterization  is  by  finding  the  coupling  magnitude  of  the 
eigenmodes  with  a  plane-wave  with  well-defined  circular  polarization.  The  coupling

  is the field of an eigenmode in a plane at z=z0. C+ and C- are respectively 

the coupling coefficient of left and right-hand polarized plane wave to the normal mode, and 
C

. If

the ratio is very large or very small, the eigenmode is circularly polarized. In the calculation, 
we considered 128 values of z0. The results are shown in Fig. 6. The ratio is calculated along 
the band “a” and band “b” and the results are completely consistent with those shown in Fig. 5. 
The above analyses are also consistent with results obtained from the SMM calculation. As a 
control  calculation,  this  analysis  was  also  applied  to  a  structure  with  cylinders  of  circular 
cross-section  put  in  a  triangular  lattice  for  a  control  test.  The  results  produced  were  as 

expected (

), i.e., the eigenmodes are linearly polarized for non-chiral structures.

ratios  (see  text) of  a  circular-polarized  plane  wave  with  the  eigenmodes  for  spiral  structures. 
Panels (a) and (b) show the coupling coefficients for if the dielectric spiral is right-handed or 
left-handed respectively. 
 

The eigenmode characterization shows that the polarization gap for the structure in Fig. 2 
will forbid the propagation of the right-hand circularly polarized light. This can be explained 
by the fact that a right-hand circularly polarized light with a wavelength that matches the pitch 
of the spiral will match the symmetry of the right-handed spiral structure. As a result, there are 
two eigenmodes at that wavelength, one with a higher frequency by concentrating its electric 
field  in  the  air,  while  the  other  localize  its  electric  field  mainly  in  the  dielectric  and  has  a 
lower frequency. A polarization gap is then formed. For left circularly polarized light, it is not 
geometrically possible for the field to “follow” the right-handed spiral, and hence no gap. 

From  the  results  in  Fig.  3(a),  3(b),  5  and  6,  it  is  expected  that  if  an  unpolaried  beam  is 
incident to this spiral structure along the ΓA direction, it will be separated into one right-hand 
circularly polarized beam and one left-hand circularly polarized beam. Inside the polarization 
gap,  the  left-hand  circularly  polarized  beam  will  be  transmitted  through  the  spirals  and  the 
right-hand one will be reflected. Hence, this structure behaves as a polarization filter. 

We now examine the polarization gap as a function of k//, the k-vector component parallel 
to the x-y plane, and results are shown in Fig. 7 along with k// along ΓM and ΓK. The result 
shows that the polarization gap is fairly robust against incidence angles.

In  summary,  we  have  performed  band  structure  and  transmission  calculations  for  dielectric 
spiral  photonic crystals  depicted in Fig. 2,  and showed  that dielectric spiral  photonic crystal 
exhibit  significant  polarization  gaps  in  which  only  one  circular  polarization  is  allowed.  The 
eigenmodes are analyzed and found  to  be  circularly polarized.  In contract  to  a quarter-wave 
plate,  there  is  no  specific  requirement  on  the  thickness  of  the  slab  in  order  to  filter  out  one 
circular  polarization  as  long  as  the  spiral  structure  is  thick.  We  suggested  laser  interference 
configurations that can achieve such geometries which was demonstrated experimentally [11].

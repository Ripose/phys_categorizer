We show analytically, and numerically that highly-dispersive media can be 

used to drastically increase lifetimes of high-Q microresonators. In such a 

resonator, lifetime is limited either by undesired coupling to radiation, or by 

intrinsic  absorption  of 

the  constituent  materials.  The  presence  of 

dispersion  weakens  coupling  to  the  undesired  radiation  modes  and  also 

effectively reduces the material absorption. 

 

 

 

 

 

Microcavities with long life-times, and very small modal volumes (i.e. very narrow 

transmission  resonance  widths  ΓTRANS)  have  important  applications  in  many  different 

fields  including:  photonics  [1,2],  non-linear  optics  [3],  biosensing  [4],  cavity  quantum 

electrodynamics  [5,6],  and  novel  frequency  standards  [7].  For  many  applications,  on-

chip-resonators  are  highly  preferred  [8].  Limits  to  increasing  lifetimes  of  such  micro-

resonators  are  most  often  determined  by  their  intrinsic  losses:  absorption  of  the 

constituent material (which determines the absorption quality factor QABS≡ωRES/(2ΓABS)), 

or  undesired  coupling  to  radiation  modes  due  to  imperfect  confinement  (which 

determines 

the 

radiation  QRAD).  The

 cannot be larger than the smaller of QRAD and QABS (QIO 

is determined by the coupling to the input and output). On a separate front, recent work 

[9,10,11]  has  shown  how  the  transmission  curve  of  a  perfect  macroscopic  ring  cavity, 

coupled only to its input and output ports can be significantly narrowed by insertion of

highly  dispersive  media  (in  that  case,  using  electromagnetically  induced  transparency 

(EIT)). It is tempting to speculate whether using highly-dispersive media could be used 

to  significantly  narrow  transmission  resonance  widths  of  high-Q  microresonators. 

Naively,  one  might  think  that  this  approach  cannot  work:  if  dispersion  increases  the 

lifetime of a resonator, that means that the light residing in the resonator has more time 

to  interact  with  the  absorptive  material,  and  more  time  to  couple  to  the  undersired 

radiation  modes.  Therefore,  it  seems  that  one  would  again  be  limited  by  QABS,  and 

QRAD, the same as before. In this manuscript, we show, that this picture is not correct: 

inserting highly dispersive material into a cavity drastically increases all of QRAD, QABS, 

and QIO, and this phenomenon could therefore be used to design micro-resonators with 

lifetimes orders of magnitude larger than what was previously possible. 

 

For  definiteness,  imagine  a  resonator,  with  one  input,  and  one  output  channel, 

with equal input and output couplings. The material from which the resonator is made is 

approximately non-dispersive, but it has some finite absorption. Imagine further that the 

confinement  of  the  resonator  is  not  perfect,  so  the  resonator  is  also  coupled  to 

undesired radiation modes. The transmission of this resonator can be modeled [12] as:

where POUT, and PIN are outgoing and incoming powers, ωRES is the resonant frequency, 

ΓABS  is  the  absorption-decay  width,  ΓRAD  is  the  radiation-decay  width,  and  ΓIO  is  the 

width  due  to  the  coupling  with  input  and  output.  As  long  as  ΓABS,ΓRAD«ΓIO,  the 

transmission width of this system can efficiently be lowered by decreasing the coupling 

to  input  and  output  (ΓIO).  However,  because  of  non-zero ΓABS  and ΓRAD,  this  program 

cannot  be 

followed 

indefinitely: 

the  ultimate 

limit 

to 

the 

transmission 

QTRANS≡ωRES/2(ΓRAD+ΓABS+ΓIO) of this system is set by: QTRANS<ωRES/2(ΓRAD+ΓABS). Note 

also that as we approach the limiting QTRANS, according to Eq.(1), the peak transmission 

drops rapidly to zero. 

For  pedagogical  reasons,  consider  first  changing  the  index  of  refraction  inside 

such a cavity by a small δn. According to perturbation theory, the only effect of this δn 

will be to change the resonance frequency ωRES, thereby sliding the whole transmission

Next,  consider  replacing  the  material  from  which  the  cavity  is  made,  with  a 

material that has the same n(ωRES), but is now highly dispersive; we can use the same 

perturbation theory to determine what happens. However, in this case, every frequency 

ω  experiences  a  different  shift  of  resonance  frequency:  that  is, ω  perceives  being  in  a 

system in which the induced δn is given by:

note that clearly δn(ωRES)=0. This δn is small, since we are interested only in behavior of 

frequencies  close  to  ωRES;  so,  we  are  justified  in  using  a  perturbative  approach  for 

studying  this  problem.  It  is  convenient  to  express  everything  in  terms  of  the  group

According  to  Eq.(3),  every  single  decay  mechanism  out  of  this  resonator  (ΓRAD, ΓABS,

This  increase  of  the  quality  factor  can  be  physically  understood  as  follows. 

According  to  Eq.(2), ω>ωRES  experiences δn>0,  thereby  perceiving  a  resonance  curve 

shifted  to  the  left  (meaning  lower  transmission  than  otherwise).  Similarly,  ω<ωRES 

experiences δn<0,  again  implying  a  reduction  of  transmission  since ω<ωRES  perceives 

the  resonance  curve  as  being  shifted  to  the  right.  Therefore,  the  final  perceived 

transmission  width  is  severely  narrowed.  Note  that  the  enhancement  factor  could  be 
huge in real physical systems: assuming σ∼1, n(ωRES)~1, and vG/c≈10-7 (as observed in 
a recent ultra slow-light experiment [15]), we get the enhancement factor of order 107! 

In order to confirm the validity of our model from Eq.(3), we perform a series of 

numerical experiments on an exemplary microcavity system. That is, we perform finite-

difference-time-domain  (FDTD)  simulations  [16],  which  solve  Maxwell’s  equations 

exactly (with no approximation apart for the discretization), including the dispersion, with 

perfectly-matched-layers (PML) boundary conditions. The cavity we focus our attention 

on is a so-called monorail photonic crystal microcavity, shown in top plot of Figure 1. It 

consists of a periodically corrugated waveguide; the cavity is introduced by introducing 

a  defect  into  the  periodicity.  The  signal  is  sent  down  the  waveguide  on  the  left  (which 

serves as the input channel); it couples through tunneling into the cavity, from where it 

decays  into  the  radiation  modes,  and  also  into  the  waveguide  on  the  left,  and  the 

waveguide on the right (which serves as the output channel). A monorail cavity of this 

class has actually already been experimentally implemented in an Si/SiO2 system [17], 

with  resonant  wavelength  of  1.56µm,  Q=265,  peak  transmission  of  82%,  and  modal 

volume  0.055µm3.  FDTD  numerical  simulations  [17]  of  that  system  reproduced  all 

experimental features very faithfully, and even quantitatively up to a discrepancy of only 

 

4

a  few  percent.  Since  in  the  current  work  we  are  not  interested  in  a  particular  physical 

system  but  rather  in  studying  the  underlying  physical  phenomena,  we  can  reduce  our 

numerical requirements immensely by studying a 2D (instead of 3D) system. 3D FDTD 

simulations would be prohibitively time-consuming in the regime of large life-times that 

we are interested in, while we do not expect the physics of our particular 2D model to be 

any different than its 3D counterpart [18]. In all our simulations, the numerical resolution 

is 40pts/a. 

 

As  our  first  numerical  simulation,  we  “measure”  the  transmission  through  our 

system,  in  the  case  when  n=3.464  in  the  “central”  region.  The  modal  profile  of  the 

resonant  mode  is  shown  in  the  bottom  panel  of  Figure  1.  The  band-gap  extends  from 

ω≈0.2(2πc/a)  to ω≈0.35(2πc/a).  As  shown  by  the  blue  curve  in  Figure  2,  the  resonant 

frequency  of  the  cavity  occurs  at ωRES=0.25443(2πc/a),  QTRANS=308,  and  on-resonant 

transmission  is  TPEAK≡POUT(ωRES)/PIN(ωRES)=0.7597.  Since  this  model  does  not  include 

absorption, the transmission is limited to the value below 100% because of the coupling 

to 

the 

radiation  modes.  From 

these 

simulations,  we 

conclude 

that 

QRAD=

=2399. 

 

Next, we introduce material dispersion into the “central” region of our system: its 

n(ω)  is  shown  in  Figure  3  [19].  The  system  is  designed  so  that  Re{n(ωRES)}= 

nSi(λ=1.5µm)=3.464,  Im{n(ωRES)}=0,  while  vG(ωRES)/c=0.0453.  (This  particular  value  of 

vG  makes  comparison  with  a  comparable  non-dispersive  cavity  easier,  as  we  will  see 

later). Over the frequency range of interest, dispersion is almost linear (so vG is nearly 

constant),  while  absorption  is  very  small.  When  we  calculate  the  transmission  through 

this  system,  we  obtain 

the  solid  green  curve 

in  Figure  2,  which  has: 

ωRES=0.25446(2πc/a),  TPEAK=0.7613,  and  QTRANS=1106.  This  value  of  QTRANS  is 

consistent with the one obtained by plugging vG(ωRES)/c=0.0453, QTRANS=308 (from the 

blue curve above), and σ=0.425, (which is obtained with a numerical computation that is 

independent  of  the  other  computations)  into  the  perturbation  theory  result  given  by 

Eq.(4) [20]. Despite the fact that light now spends much more time in the cavity (thereby 

having  more  time  to  couple  to  the  radiation  modes),  the  peak  transmission  is  not 

affected.  To  appreciate  the  significance  of  this  fact,  consider  an  alternative  (very 

 

5

commonly  used)  way  of  increasing  lifetime:  instead  of  adding  material  dispersion,  we 

add one more period of holes to the sides of the cavity (so there are 4 holes on each 

side). The transmission is shown as the solid red curve in Figure 2: QTRANS=1079 (this is 

very similar to QTRANS in the case of the green curve because of the particular vG value 

chosen  for  the  green  curve),  but  TPEAK=0.2918,  which  is  2.6  times  lower  than  for  the 

solid  green  curve.  In  the  temporal  domain  (not  shown),  both  the  green,  and  red  solid 

curves  are  exponentially  decaying  with  the  same  rate,  but  in  the  case  of  the  green 

curve, ≈2.6  times  more  energy  is  transmitted  to  the  output  than  in  the  case  of  the  red 

curve.  Intuitively,  one  can  also  understand  this  peculiar  influence  of  the  material 

dispersion  as  follows:  from  the  point  of  view  of  material  dispersion,  both  the  radiation 

modes,  and  waveguide  modes  look  the  same.  Therefore  dispersion  weakens  (slows 

down) the coupling to each of these modes by the same amount, thus making QTRANS 

larger,  while  leaving  TPEAK  unchanged.  In  contrast,  adding  an  additional  hole  to  each 

side of the cavity lowers only ΓIO, thus decreasing TPEAK. Before proceeding, we perform 

one  final  check  on  this  picture  by  lowering  vG(ωRES)/c  in  the  central  region  to  0.0150. 

The  result  is  shown  as  the  solid  black  curve  in  Figure  2:  although  TPEAK  is  nearly  the 

same  as  the  solid  green  and  blue  curves,  QTRANS=2665,  which  is  again  a  value 

consistent with the perturbation theory result [20], despite the fact that at such low group 

velocity  we  are  stretching  the  limits  of  our  numerical  resolution.  Note  however  that 

because  of  the  extreme  resonance  width  narrowing  at  such  a  low  group  velocity,  only 

frequencies ω  that  are  very  close  to ωRES  play  important  role  for  the  system.  But,  it  is 

precisely for these frequencies that our perturbative model from Eq.(3) is most justified, 

since all our expansions become better and better approximations precisely in that limit. 

For example, neglecting second order dispersion in Eq.(2) causes even smaller errors 

than in the case when group velocity is larger. 

 

Considerations  of  the  previous  paragraph  were  for  nearly  absorption-free 

systems. Now, we proceed to study the effects of increased material absorption. To do 

this,  we  take  the  exact  systems  presented  by  the  solid  blue,  red,  and  green  curves  in 

Figure 2, and add the same amount of absorption  Im{n}=0.0077 to each of them. The 

resulting transmissions are shown by the dashed curves in Figure 2. Consistent with our 

model,  the  TPEAKs  in  the  blue  and  green  case  decreased  by  the  same  factor 

 

6

(TPEAK≈0.276  now);  both  of  these  curves  also  have  significantly  lower  QTRANSs  now 

(QTRANS=187, and 669 respectively), but as expected by Eq.(4), the ratio of their QTRANSs 

did  not  change.  Finally,  from  TPEAK,  QRAD  and  QTRANS  of  the  blue  curve,  we  obtain 

QABS=476,  which  is  quantitatively  consistent  with  the  observed  TPEAK=0.0273  for  the 

dashed  red  curve,  and  with  the  perturbation  theory  prediction  QABS=n/(2Im{n}σ)  [20]. 

Since the light has much more time to interact with the absorptive material in the case of 

the  dashed  red  curve  (QTRANS=327),  the  resulting  factor  of  decrease  in  TPEAK  is  much 

larger than in the case of the dashed blue curve. In contrast, our dispersive cavity (even 

now, in presence of absorption) has 10 times larger transmission than the dashed red 

curve,  while  actually  having  a  larger  lifetime  (by  a  factor  of  2).  Another  way  to 

understand  this  somewhat  counter-intuitive  result  is  to  note  that  at ωRES,  the  systems 

corresponding  to  the  blue  and  green  curves  look  exactly  the  same,  meaning  that 

transmission at ωRES has to be exactly the same; the rest of our results follow from this 

simple constraint.  

 

Before concluding, a few words are in order to discuss various possible physical 

implementations  of  the  scheme  we  propose.  The  ultra  slow-light  experiment  from  Ref. 

15, is an obvious option. There are other potentially promising systems to create slow-

light  media,  including:  polaritonic  media,  metal-dielectric  surfaces  supporting  surface-

plasmons,  and  USL  in  solids  [23].  Polaritons  and  surface-plasmons  tend  to  be  very 

lossy  in  the  regimes  of  high  dispersion;  to  compensate  for  the  loss,  they  could  be 

combined  with  gain  media,  or  they  could  be  cooled  to  very  low  temperatures  in  which 

case  losses  drop  dramatically.  In  USL  losses  are  not  a  problem,  and  it  has  a  further 

interesting  characteristic  that  its  dispersion  can  be  externally  controlled  with  changing 

the  amplitude  of  an  external  coupling  field  [15];  this  could  potentially  provide  a  micro-

cavity whose Q could be dynamically changed by many orders of magnitude. A typical 

n(ω) in USL media has a very similar shape to the one we show in Figure 3; introducing 

USL  media  into  a  cavity  would  therefore  produce  very  similar  results  to  the  ones  we 

show in Figure 2. Because of the importance of their applications, very significant efforts 

have been devoted to designing high-Q microcavities [8,21,22]. Most of these designs 

are compatible with using highly-dispersive materials; gaseous USL is suitable for use 

with  a  photonic  crystal  microcavity  from  Ref.  21,  while  solid-state  based  (in  Pr  doped 

 

7

Y2SiO5)  USL  [23]  could  be  used  with  most  existing  microresonator  designs.  For 
example,  by  naively  combining  solid-state  USL  from  Ref.23  (vG/c=1.5∗10-7)  with  the 
microcavity design from Ref.8 (Q>108), it may be possible to achieve Q>1015. (Clearly, 

to  achieve  such  long  lifetimes,  many  various  technical  hurdles  would  have  to  be 

overcome,  including:  time-dependent  stray  fields,  and  temperature  fluctuations). 

Alternatively, recently demonstrated surface-plasmon photonic crystals [24], or photonic 

crystals incorporating polaritons [25], could also be used. In any case, the new physical 

phenomena  presented  here  should  have  relevance 

to  a  variety  of 

important 

applications. 

 

In conclusion, we have demonstrated how adding highly dispersive materials to 

microresonators could be used to increase their lifetimes by many orders of magnitude, 

while  preserving  their  peak  transmissions,  even  in  the  presence  of  radiation,  and 

absorption  losses.  Microresonators  of  such  unprecedently  narrow  line-widths,  and  tiny 

modal volumes, might enable many important applications in fields as diverse as: cavity 

QED,  nonlinear  optics,  and  perhaps  even  integrable  atomic  clocks.  The  underlying 

physical  mechanism  applies  for  any  cavity  geometry,  but  we  expect  it  to  be  most 

beneficial precisely in the case of microresonators since they are typically most limited 

by radiation and absorption losses.

This was also confirmed in Pierre R. Villeneuve, Daniel S. Abrams, Shanhui Fan, 
and  J.D.  Joannopoulos,  Optics  Letters,  21,  2017,  (1996),  where  a  2D  monorail 
system was simulated: quantitative differences of order few were found, but the 
physics of the two systems was exactly the same. 

19)  While the exact line shape is not important, such a line shape is typical of USL 
media; here, it is obtained with two absorption lines sandwiching a gain line.

The agreement between our simulations, and perturbation theory is always within 
20) 
a  few  percent;  the  sources  of  discrepancy  include:  neglecting  absorption, 
neglecting  dependence  of  vG  on  ω,  limited  resolution,  and  inapplicability  of 
perturbation theory for leaky modes. The expected contribution of each of these 
errors is ~few%.

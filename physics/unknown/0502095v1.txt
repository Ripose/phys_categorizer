1. Introduction 
The  derivation  of  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  (LET)  for  the 
space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event  starts  in  many  textbooks 
devoted to the subject starts with the derivation of the transformation for 
the time coordinates 

                                                                                             (1) 

and for the x(x’) space coordinate 

 .                                                                                           (2) 

We measure the x(x’) space coordinates along the overlapped OX(O’X’) 
axes of the K(XOY) and K’(X’O’Y’) inertial reference frames in the well 
known standard arrangement. 
In  order  to  extend  the  results  to  two  space  dimensions  Authors 
[1],[2],[3],[4] add to them 

                                                                                                    (3) 

considering  that  distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of 
relative motion are relativistic invariants because of thought experiments 
and  of  the  principle  of  relativity.  Sophisticated  students  often  ask  if  the 
transition  from  one-space  dimension  to  two  space  dimensions  does  not 
affect relation (1) which depends only on the x coordinate. 
Mathews Jr. [5] presents relativistic velocity transformation without using 
the (LET). We use them in order to present a direct two-space dimensions 
approach  to  the  (LET).    The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  prove  that  the 
transformation  for  the  time  coordinate  (1)  depends  only  on  the  x  space 
coordinate measured along the overlapped axes. 
2. A direct two-space dimensions approach 
Mathews Jr. [5] presents relativistic velocity transformation without using 
the (LET). We use them in order to present a direct two-space dimensions 
approach to the (LET). 
Consider  a  particle  that  goes  at  the  common  origin  of  time  (t=t’=0) 
through  the  origins  O  and  O’  located  at  that  very  moment  at  the  same 
  relative  to  K,  but  with 
point  in  space.  It  moves  with  velocity

velocity 
θ when detected from K but along a direction θ’ when detected from K’. 
We  measure  the  angles  θ  and  θ’  from  the  positive  directions  of  the 
overlapped axes OX(O’X’). The relativistic transformation equations are 
[5] 

                                                                                   (4) 

                                                                                  (5)  

    .                                                     (6) 

Relation (6) leads to the following relativistic identity 

                                                                         (7) 

.  

which  remains  an  identity  even  if  we  multiply  both  its  sides  with  a 
relativistic invariant, say a proper time interval
In accordance with the scenario we follow, at a given time, we find at a 
given point of the plane defined by the axes of the two involved reference 
frames,  a  clock  C(x,y)  at  rest  in  K,  a  clock  C’(x’,y’).  At  the  same  time 
and  at  the  same  point  we  find  a  clock  C0  that  moves  with  velocity  u 
relative  to  K  and  with  velocity  u’  relative  to  K’.  Let  dt,  dt’  and  dτ  be 
infinitesimal  changes  in  the  readings  of  the  three  clock  respectively.  In 
accordance with the formula which describes the time dilation effect, that 
can be derived without using the (LET) [6] we should have 

                                                                                           (8)

Multiplying  both  sides  of  relation  (7)  with  dτ  and  taking  into  account 
relations (8) and (9) it becomes

depending only on the x’ coordinate. Starting with the relativistic identity

a relativistic invariant. 
3. Conclusions 
Mathews  Jr.  [5]  derives  relations  (5)  and  (6)  based  on  thought 
experiments,  time  dilation,  and  length  contraction  and  kinematical 
considerations. Based on his results we can consider that relation (10) has 
its  roots  in  the  same  facts  showing  that  transition  from  one-space 
dimension to two-space dimensions does not affect the transformation of 
the time coordinate.

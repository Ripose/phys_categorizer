Abstract

We discuss the new layout of a cavity chain ( superstructure) allowing, we hope,  significant cost
reduction of the RF  system of  both linacs of the TESLA linear collider. The proposed scheme
increases the fill factor and thus makes an effective gradient of an accelerator higher. We present
mainly computations we have performed up to now and which encouraged us to order the copper
model of the scheme, still keeping in mind that experiments with a beam will be    necessary  to
prove if the proposed solution can be used for the acceleration.

1      INTRODUCTION

Recent results have shown  that two main technical  specifications:  the  accelerating  gradient  Eacc
and the quality factor Qo  ,  25  MV/m  and  5·109  respectively,  are  achievable  for  bulk  niobium
cavities [1, 2]. The R&D program at DESY, to establish  superconducting technology for at least
25 MV/m, is continued in order to reach specifications more repetitively and to lower the cost of
this technology. The essential part of the total investment is  the  cost  of  the  RF-system,  meant
here  as  the  sum  of  cost  of  accelerating  structures  with  auxiliaries  and  cost  of  RF-power
distribution system. To cut this cost more effort should be done to:

-  decrease the  number of  RF components, like: fundamental mode (FM) couplers,  

                HOM couplers, waveguides, circulators, waveguide transformers.., per unit length,

-   increase the effective gradient  Eeff  in the collider.

In the  present  TTF  design  there  are:  1  FM  coupler  and  2  HOM  couplers  per  9-cell  structure
which is almost 1 m long. The consequence of such dense positioning of  FM couplers is that the
RF-power distribution system becomes complex and thus more expensive.

The effective accelerating gradient in both linacs will be low,  only 17.8  MV/m ,  when  cavities
will  be  operated  at  25  MV/m.  There  are  two  reasons  for  that:  a  too  small  fill  factor  and  the
unflatness of the accelerating field.

The fill factor, defined here as ratio:

fill factor ” cavity active length
cavity total length

has a low value of  0.75,  resulting from the length of interconnections between cavities, which
are at present 3l /2 long (see Fig. 1). This length has been chosen at the very beginning of the sc
linear collider studies.

   Fig. 1 The  9-cell cavity and the interconnection.

The arguments at that time were:

- good cavity separation for the accelerating mode and
- simplification in the phase adjustment.

The first argument will be discussed later but 7 km of  passive length seems to  be  unjustified.
The  second  argument  is  not  valid  any  more  since  a  3-stub  remote  controlled  waveguide
transformer can be applied in the RF-input line of each cavity, to adjust both:  the phase and the
value of Qext, in order to get reflection-free operation.
The unflatness of the accelerating field within one structure is usually    ~ 10  %.  A  typical  field

profile is shown in Fig. 2. For the accelerating p -mode, the sensitivity of the field amplitude Acell
in  an individual cell to the frequency error D fcell of  this cell, is given by the formula:

D Acell ~

where N is the number of cells in the cavity and kcc is the cell-to-cell coupling.

                  Fig. 2   An example of the field profile in a 9-cell TESLA cavity.

The experience with 20 TTF cavities showed that  the current cavity design with N = 9 and  kcc =
0.019 is almost at the limit. The design specification of the  field unflatness below  5%  is rather
hard to obtain. Each chemical, thermal or mechanical cavity treatment tildes the field profile. This
leads to a reduction of effective Eacc  since the achievable gradient is usually limited by the thermal
break down in the cell with maximum amplitude.

A significant cost reduction can be done when the number of cells per structure  increases. This
is  mainly  due  to  lower  number  of    RF  components  and  less  FM  couplers  per  unit  length.
Unfortunately there are two fundamental limitations on N. First of all,  the field profile, as it can
be seen from the formula, becomes less stable, proportional to N 2.  Secondly, the probability of
trapping of parasitic resonances within the structure is higher. This is especially dangerous for sc
cavities because even low (R/Q) parasitic modes can have finally big beam impedance due to high
quality factor.

Since the length of interconnections seems to be oversized and simply increasing of N  looks not
very promising, we propose a different solution which is discussed in the next chapter.

2      SUPERSTRUCTURE

To  overcome  limitations  on  N  and  simultaneously  to  make  interconnections  shorter  one  may
think to use the layout (superstructure) shown  schematically in Fig.  3.  The idea is to couple the
cavities by short interconnections to enable an energy transfer from cavity to cavity instead of to
separate them by a  long  interconnection.  In  this  scheme,  similar  to  the  present  design,  HOM
couplers are attached to interconnections and each cavity (sub-unit) is equipped with a tuner. This
layout  will  allow  to  increase  the  number  of  cells  fed  by  one  FM  coupler,  avoiding    the  two
limitations we discussed above. Both,  the field flatness and the HOM damping, can be handled
still at the sub-unit level.

       Fig. 3  Chain of  Ns cavities coupled by short interconnections (superstructure).

The length of the interconnection is chosen to be half of the wave length, l /2. When N  is an odd
number, the p -0 mode (p
 cell-to-cell phase advance and 0 structure-to-structure phase advance)
can be used for the acceleration. As an example, the accelerating field profile of that mode in two
neighboring  cavities  and  in  the  interconnection  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.  The  expected  coupling
between  sub-units  depends  now,  since  the  length  has  been  fixed,    on  the  diameter  of  the
interconnecting beam tube and on the field strength in the end cells. For  the reasonable geometry
of the interconnection this coupling is much smaller than the cell-to-cell coupling but using tuners
for the frequency correction one can equalize the mean value of the field amplitude between sub-
units ( not between cells within one sub-unit).

3      COMPARISON  OF    TWO  SUPERSTRUCTURES  AND  THE  TTF  CAVITY

The performance of the superstructure depends on the field profile stability within each sub-unit.
There are two ways to make the accelerating field less sensitive to the cell  frequency error (see
previous formula):

- increasing coupling cell-to-cell,  and /or
- reduction of number of cells per sub-unit.

The first proposed superstructure, made of  four 9-cell cavities, had a more stable field in sub-
units, as compared to the TTF cavity, due to the big mid iris diameter and almost 3 times bigger
cell-to-cell  coupling  [3].  Unfortunately,  the  bigger  aperture  has  some  disadvantages:  higher
Epeak/Eacc and Hpeak/Eacc and lower impedance (R/Q), than the present TTF design.  These caused
that the total improvement in effective Eacc was rather small. Nevertheless, the proposed shape is
better  for  alternative  fabrication  methods,  like  hydroforming  or  spinning,  being  still  under
development  and  which  may  in  the  future  significantly  reduce  the  investment  cost  [4,  5].  In
addition, much lower transversal and longitudinal loss  factors make this superstructure suitable
for the acceleration of  bunches with higher population of particles, like in the case of the muon
collider.
It seems that the most probable future scenario for the energy upgrade  of  the  TESLA  collider,
above 500 GeV, is the operation at higher accelerating gradient or/and making the collider longer
[6]. This brought us to an alternative version of the superstructure [7],  based on the TTF shape
with modified end cells and reduced N  from 9 to 7.  As before,  the superstructure is made of 4
sub-units.  This  version  keeps  Epeak/Eacc  and  Hpeak/Eacc    low  as  for  the  TTF  cavity  and  makes
operation above 25 MV/m more visible, since maximum electric and magnetic fields on the Nb
wall are further from the theoretical limitations. Table 1 contains a list of    parameters  of    both
superstructures and the TTF cavity.

The two last rows of the table show Eeff  for the operation at 25 MV/m. In case of superstructures
values: E1eff and E2eff are calculated with two limitations. The first one,  for both values, results
from  the  expected  field  unflatness,  scaled  from  the  value  observed  for  the  TTF  cavities,
proportional to the field instability factor, shown in the fourth row. The second limitation is Hpeak
for E1eff  and Epeak  for E2eff. Here,  the scaling is    according  to  factors  Hpeak/Eacc  and  Epeak/Eacc,
respectively.  Note,  that  the  maximum  improvement  in  the  effective  field  is  obtained  for  the
superstructure based on a 7-cell sub-unit.

4    REFILLING  OF  CELLS  AND  THE  BUNCH  TO  BUNCH  ENERGY  SPREAD

The most critical part of the numerical simulation is the calculation of the transient state and the
bunch  to  bunch  energy  spread.  Two  codes:  HOMDYN  (beam  dynamics  and  transients,  see
Appendix)  and  LAPLACE  (transients  only),  showed  that  there  is  enough  time  to  re-fill  the
cell’s energy in the superstructure before the next bunch arrives [8,  9].  This result is rather not
obvious since coupling between sub-units is very small.
As an example, the computed energy gain for the small iris superstructure, when it is operated at
25 MV/m, is shown in Fig. 5a, b.

     Fig. 5a.  Energy gain for 1130 bunches accelerated with the small iris superstructure.

    Fig. 5b.  Energy gain vs. time.

The energy spread is mainly due to a small error in the injection time to and to the interference of
accelerating  mode  with  mode  p -p
/4.  The  mean  value  of  the  energy  (solid  line  in  Fig.  5a)
increases asymptotically. This indicates that the beam was injected few picoseconds too early and
the accelerating voltage in the superstructure rises until the match condition is reached.
The  oscillation  of  the  bunch  energy,  better  seen  in  Fig.  5b,  has  a  small  amplitude  and  the
frequency  f = 80 kHz,   which equals to the difference between frequencies fp -p
/4    and  fp -0.  The
maximum energy spread for the whole train of 1130 is given for both superstructures in Table 2.

5          DISCUSSION

In addition, to the improvement in the effective  accelerating  gradient,  the  number  of    FM  and
HOM  couplers  will  be  significantly  reduced,  if  the  proposed  scheme  can  be  used  for  the
acceleration. Table 3 shows the total amount of couplers and tuners needed in the TESLA collider
in two cases: when linac’s layout is based on the  current  TTF  cavity  design  and  alternatively,
when it is based on the small iris superstructure.

The needed number of  FM couplers is reduced by a factor of  3.  This has severe consequences
for the cost of whole RF-system. When the diameter of interconnections is bigger than 114 mm
all HOMs are above cutoff. Their field strength in the interconnections seems to be high enough
for damping with HOM couplers attached at  mid of  interconnections.  In  that  way  each  HOM
coupler can be used  to  damp  modes  from  two  neighboring  cavities.  Such  a  damping  scheme
requires less HOM couplers than the TTF damping scheme.

The small iris superstructure  based on a 7-cell sub-unit  increases the total number of cavities by
22  %.  This  is  an  additional  cost  for  22  %  more  tuners  and  LHe  vessels.  Nevertheless  the
mentioned simplification in the RF system and the simplification in the cryostat construction will
dominate and a total cost reduction can be expected.

The proposed layout is not yet proven experimentally. In the near future a copper model of the
superstructure will be ordered. The RF-measurements on that model should help us  to  make  a
cross  check  with  the  computation  we  have  done  up  to  now  for  the  superstructure  in  the
superconducting and the normalconducting version.
We will be able to check on the copper  model:

-  tuning and field profile adjustment,
-  transient state in individual cells,
-  HOM damping scheme,
-  coupling to FM coupler,
-  influence of machining errors.

We won’t be able to  prove  with  this  copper  model  the  numerical  simulation  of  the  bunch-to-
bunch energy spread. For that Nb prototype must  be built and tested with the beam.

The power transfer by the FM coupler feeding superstructure  is 640 kW. The new version of the
FM coupler developed at DESY has been tested up to 1 MW for whole TESLA pulse length [10].
The limitation was due to the RF-power source.  Since this version already overcame the power
needed  for  operation  of  superstructure  at  25  MV/m  we  do  not  expect  here  fundamental
difficulties.

APPENDIX  -  BEAM  LOADING  COMPUTATIONS

We studied the superstructure-beam interaction by  means  of  the  code  HOMDYN  (see  [8]  and
other references quoted there for a more detailed discussion).  Originally the code was  developed
for  single  and  multi-bunch  dynamics  computation  in  injectors  devices,  where  transition  from
classical  to  relativistic  dynamics  takes  place  and  space  charge  effects  dominate  the  bunch
transverse dynamics. Such a code relies on a simple self-consistent model that couples a current
density  description  of  beam  evolution  with  the  Maxwell  equations  in  the  normal  modes
expansion form. It takes into account single bunch space charge effects, beam loading of a long
train of bunches,  build-up effects of higher order modes and an  on  axis  localized  generator  in
order describe the cavity re-filling from bunch to bunch passage.  The code is of course suitable
for  a  fully  relativistic  beam  dynamics  computation,  especially  when  transient  fields  excitation
plays  an  important  role.  Several  cross  checks  with  other  similar  models,  PIC's  codes  and
recently with experimental  measurement  of  transient  fields  excitation  in  a  superstructure  [11],
allow us to conclude that our model is reliable.

We recall in this appendix the main equations of the model concerning the case under study,  with
some new features we added recently. We represent the electric field in the cavity as  a  sum  of
normal orthogonal modes:

are any normalized solution of the Helmholtz equation, satisfying the boundary condition:

within  the  cavity  volume.  They  can  be  computed  by  standard  finite  differences  codes
(SUPERFISH,  MAFIA,  etc.),  or,  as  in  the  present  case,  by  a  finite  element  code  recently
developed [12]. In the following we will restrict our attention to the on axis longitudinal electric
field components of  TM modes.  The modes amplitude equations are:

where as a driving current density we consider the superposition of two terms  J = Jg +  Jb .  The
term Jg is a feeding sinusoidal current density,  representing  a  point  like  power  supply  on  the
cavity axis located at zg.  The second term Jb represents  the  beam  current  density.  The  loaded
quality factor Q accounts for the cavity losses.

The basic assumption in the description of the beam term consists in representing each bunch as a
uniform charged cylinder, whose length L and radius R can vary under a self-similar evolution,
i.e. keeping anyway uniform the charge distribution inside the bunch. Further details are reported
in [8],  we recall here that the  beam  current  density  term  Jb  can  be  written  for  each  bunch  as
follows:

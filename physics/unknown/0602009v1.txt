Abstract 

The properties of the electron source define the ultimate limit of the beam quality in 

linear accelerators like Free Electron Lasers (FEL). The goal is to develop an electron 

gun delivering beam emittance lower than current state of the art. Such a gun should 

reduce  the  cost  and  size  of  an  X-ray  Free  Electron  Laser  (XFEL).  In  this  paper  we 

present  two  concepts  of  field  emitter  cathodes  which  could  potentially  produce  low 

emittance  beam.  The  first  challenging  parameter  for  such  cathode  is  to  emit  peak 

current  as  high  as  5  A.  This  is  the  minimum  current  requirement  for  the  XFEL 

concept  from  Paul  Scherrer  Institut.1  Maximum  current  of  0.12  A  and  0.58  A  have 

been reached respectively with field emitter arrays (FEA) and single needle cathodes. 

Laser  assisted  field  emission  gave  encouraging  results  to  reach  even  higher  peak 

current and to pre-bunch the beam.

Introduction 
 

The design of an electron gun capable of producing beams with an emittance one order 

of magnitude lower than current technology 2,3 would reduce considerably the cost and size of a 

XFEL radiating at 0.1nm.1 In addition to low beam emittance, the electron source should also 

deliver  peak  currents  of  several  amperes  in  order  to  drive  efficiently  a  XFEL.  Worldwide 

electron gun development is concentrated mainly on photocathodes4,5 or thermionic cathodes6 

for such accelerator applications. An alternative gun design could be based on field emission.7 

Two  kinds  of  field  emitter  sources  are  currently  explored:  field  emitter  arrays  (FEAs)  and 

single tip (needle) cathodes. With FEAs it is foreseen to use two gate layers above the matrix of 

tips: the first gate extracts the electrons from each tip and the second gate focuses them. This 

should produce an electron beam having the diameter of the FEA (below one millimeter) with 

very small divergence (controlled by the focusing gate layer). In the case of a needle cathode, 

the  initial  beam  size  is  extremely  small  (in  the  order  of  a  few  micrometers)  and  the  beam 

divergence is defined by electric field lines (which depend on the geometrical shape around the 

emitting area). Table 1 summarizes the targeted parameters for the two types of cathodes.  

The first challenge is to achieve several amperes of peak current without tip destruction. Great 

care in handling and processing the cathodes together with emission duration in the nanosecond 

region  at  low  repetition  rate  (10Hz)  gave  encouraging  results  to  reach  high  peak  current 

emission.8 In this paper, we present the maximum peak current reached with FEAs and needle 

cathode as well as new perspectives to pre-bunch the beam with a laser.  

 

 

 

Limitations to high peak current emission 

2

The  basic  limitation  to  high  current  emission  from  sharp  tips  is  the  generation  of 

vacuum  arcs  between  tips  and  surrounding  materials.  The  interaction  between  the  electron 

beam  and  the  surrounding  surfaces  (gate  layer,  collector,  vacuum  chamber,  …)  induces 

desorption  of  gas  which  can  be  ionized  and  back  bombard  the  tip  surface.  These  ions  can 

damage  or  contaminate  the  emitter  and  in  worse  cases,  they  can  trigger  a  vacuum  arc.  In 

addition, the heat that is produced on tip surface due to Joule effect and/or Nottingham effect 

can also induce thermal desorption of neutral particles. Fortunately in a XFEL application, we 

are only interested in very short emission durations, ideally 15 ps at low repetition rate (< 100 

Hz).  Such  operation  regime  should  prevent  the  tip  from  overheating  so  that  higher  current 

densities could be reached  9. Another limit to high current emission for FEAs is the tip to tip 

emission  uniformity.  A  maximum  number  of  tips  must  contribute  to  the  emission  in  order  to 

reach  a  high  peak  current  (and  also  to  obtain  good  beam  uniformity).10  Pulse  conditioning 

techniques  are  currently  under  development  to  improve  the  uniformity.11  Finally,  current 

limitation due to space charge effect can occur when the accelerating field is not high enough 

(see below). The targeted accelerating field (see Table 1) should avoid this limitation. 

 

 

FEA electron sources 

 

 

In order to characterize FEA properties we tested commercially available samples from 

SRI Inc.12 (Menlo Park, CA). Those FEAs have 50’000 molybdenum tips on a one millimeter 

diameter  disk  area.  Tips  are  grown  on  a  p-doped  Si  wafer  with  a  resistivity  around  10  –  30 

Ω.cm  and  separated  from  a  Mo  gate  layer  by  a  1  micrometer  thick  dielectric  layer.  The 

3

capacitance due to overlapping electrodes has been measured to be around 150 pF. This gives 

already a maximum cut-off frequency of the FEA around 20 MHz (assuming 50 Ω as for the 

characteristic impedance of the transmission line).  

FEAs  are  tested  in  a  triode  configuration  as  represented  in  Figure  1.  The  FEA  gate  is 

grounded  and  negative  voltage  pulses  with  amplitude  Vge  and  duration  τ  (full  width  at  half 

maximum) are applied to the tips at a repetition rate of 10Hz. The typical rise time of voltage 

pulses is around 3 ns for 150V amplitude. A faraday cup is facing the FEA at a distance dFEA-FC 

variable from 3mm to 2cm. The faraday cup is continuously biased with a positive voltage VFC. 

Figure 2 shows current pulses obtained by applying voltage pulses with τ =10 ns. These voltage 

pulses  are  not  fully  transmitted  from  the  pulser  to  the  tips  because  of  the  resistive  and 

capacitive load of the FEA (the charging time of the FEA is longer than 10ns). In consequence 

the  voltage  amplitude  effectively  seen  by  the  tips  is  only  a  fraction  of  the  applied  amplitude 

indicated on Figure 2. In order to avoid this filtering effect, we used pulses with τ =30 ns so 

that  the  effective  voltages  between  tips  and  gate  has  enough  time  to  reach  the  applied 

amplitude.  Figure  3  represents  the  collected  peak  current  Icoll  versus  applied  amplitude  Vge 

when τ = 30 ns, that is to say the current – voltage characteristic of the FEA. 

Together  with  pulse  conditioning  techniques,13  peak  current  as  high  as  120  mA  have  been 

measured. With such emitted current level, the resistivity of the silicon wafer as well as space 

charge effects begin to play a significant role. Figure 3 illustrates the influence of the electric 

field which accelerates electrons between the FEA and the faraday cup. In Figure 3 two sets of 

measurements have been taken with dFEA-FC = 2cm and dFEA-FC = 3mm respectively with a fixed 

VFC equal to 4.5kV. This leads to two mean accelerating fields (Eacc.) in the gap between the 

FEA and the faraday cup (Eacc.=VFC / dFEA-FC ). With only 0.2 MV/m of accelerating field the 

 

4

emission  saturates  because  of  space  charge  effects  14.  At  1.5  MV/m,  the  influence  of  space 

charge is less important, however a Fowler - Nordheim (FN) plot (see inset of Figure 2) shows 

again a departure from the expected straight line (around 1/Vge ~ 0.01).  

Accelerating gradients in electron guns are in general much larger (several hundreds of MV / 

m) so that our targeted peak current should not be limited by space charge effect.  

These  tests  enabled  us  to  better  identify  what  would  be  the  ideal  FEA  for  our  gun 

application.  We  initiated  a  program  of  FEAs  development  and  the  so-called  molding 

technique15,16  has  been  chosen  as  a  fabrication  technology.  It  is  a  more  simple  procedure  in 

comparison to some other FEA production techniques (e.g. Spindt method) but it leads to less 

sharp  emitters  and  requires  higher  tip  to  gate  voltage.  Figure  4  represents  pictures  of  a 

pyramidal tip array and the top view of a single gated tip. In our application, such a pyramidal 

tip shape with large apex radius will help to dissipate heat when large current is emitted. The 

wafer which supports the tips is metallic (no silicon) so that material resistance is smaller than 

in commercially available FEAs.  

In  order  to  modulate  the  emission  to  picosecond  level  we  will  adopt  a  low  capacitance  FEA 

design  similar  to  Ref  17.  In  parallel,  we  are  currently  exploring  another  way  to  produce  short 

electron bunches by using picosecond laser pulses to assist field emission.  

Single tip electron sources

Single  needle  cathodes  represent  an  interesting  candidate  for  low  emittance  electron 

sources.  These  single  needle  cathodes  are  made  from  etched  wires  and  can  be  coated  and 

formed in order to carry high current emission. Such single tip requires a high voltage (tens of 

kilovolts) to emit since there is no close spaced gate layer. Standard electronic devices cannot 

produce kilovolt pulses of 15 ps duration. One way to achieve short emission duration is to use 

pulsed laser light illuminating the tip while high electric field is applied as in 18 and 19. The high 

electric  field  present  around  the  tip  apex  lowers  the  potential  barrier  of  the  crystal  so  that 

photoemission  with  less  energetic  photons  becomes  possible.  This  process  presents  several 

advantages  for  a  low  emittance  gun  application:  1)  very  short  emission  duration  with 

picosecond  laser  pulses,  2)  no  UV  light  is  required  to  reach  high  quantum  efficiency  and  3) 

photoelectrons  are  emitted  with  less  initial  kinetic  energy  (so  less  transverse  kinetic  energy 

which increases emittance) than with standard photocathode.  

Tests  have  been  carried  out  with  a  Nd-YAG  laser  delivering  pulses  of  duration  τlaser 

(τlaser = 10ns full width at half maximum) at 532 nm and illuminating a ZrC tip from AP Tech 

Inc.20. The challenge is to extract a minimum of 5 A from the apex of a needle tip (typically an 

area  of  a  few  micrometer  square)  without  destroying  it.  Figure  5  represents  the  experimental 

setup. The tip faces a faraday cup which is at 2 cm distance. Negative voltage pulses (200ns to 

1 ms at 20 Hz) can be applied to the tip with maximum amplitude of – 5 kV. The Faraday cup 

can be biased with a DC voltage of up to 25 kV. The laser beam is perpendicular to the tip axis.  

Figure  6  represents  the  typical  laser  intensity  profile  and  the  corresponding  current  pulse 

collected on the faraday cup (laser pulse is delayed because of a longer transmission line). This 

current pulse has been measured with a bias T in series with the faraday cup. If we assume a 

laser  beam  of  5mm  diameter  and  energy  of  100  mJ  per  pulse,  we  can  estimate  that  the  peak 

 

6

power illuminating the tip (P532nm) was around 108 W/cm2 (with τlaser = 10ns). Without applying 

the voltage, no current is detected: photons at 532 nm (2.3 eV) cannot extract photoelectrons 

from ZrC which has a work function around 3.5 eV.21 When the electric field is present around 

tip  apex,  the  potential  barrier  is  lowered  and  electrons  excited  by  532nm  photons  can  escape 

into vacuum. The tip radius r is around one micrometer leading to an electric field at the tip of 

F  ~  2  GV/m  at  V  =  10  kV  and  assuming  for  the  field  enhancement  factor  β=  F/V  that  β  ~ 

1/(5.r).22 

Figure  7  represents  current  pulses  measured  when  laser  light  was  focused  on  the  tip  apex, 

giving higher laser power density (the laser power density has not been directly measured but a 

rough estimation gives: 2.108 W/cm2 < P532nm < 1011 W/cm2). Current pulses are measured with 

a fast Rogowski coil from Bergoz (0.5 V/A). Peak current as high as 580 mA has been obtained 

with focused laser light and 14 kV between the tip and the faraday cup. In order to avoid laser 

ablation of the tip, the laser power was decreased to a level close to the lasing threshold. This 

caused  large  amplitude  fluctuations  of  the  laser  power,  directly  translated  into  current  pulse 

fluctuations (examples at 10 and 14kV on figure 7). Although there are amplitude fluctuations, 

figure 7 shows a dependence of the current with the applied voltage.  

This dependence appears more clearly on figure 8 where averaged peak current values (over 25 

acquisitions) versus voltage are represented. Voltage pulses are applied to the tip with a fixed 

amplitude  of  -5  kV  (two  pulses  durations  are  tested:  200ns  and  1000ns)  and  only  the  DC 

voltage applied to the Faraday Cup is varied. When the laser is off only field emitted electrons 

are collected with an onset voltage around 10 kV. Such a turn on voltage for field emission is 

compatible  with  a  tip  apex  radius  around  one  micrometer.  When  laser  light  is  present,  the 

current  is  more  than  one  thousand  times  larger.  The  photocurrent  dependence  on  the  applied 

 

7

voltage  follows  the  relation  between  the  potential  barrier  height  and  the  electric  field  F.  As 

described by Garcia 18, the number of electrons per unit volume which can be possibly excited 

above the potential barrier by incident photons of energy hυ, can be expressed as follow:

where m is the electron mass,  h the Planck constant, EF the Fermi level, Φ the work function, q 

the  elementary  charge  and  ε0  the  electric  constant.  Electron  density  of  equation  (1)  can  be 

converted into a current value: I = ρe(F).S.L.q/τlaser where S is the emitting area on tip apex, L 

the  penetration  depth  of  laser  light.  Figure  9  represents  a  comparison  between  the  measured 

curves  of  Figure  8  and  the  current  deduced  from  equation  (1).  In  order  to  plot  the  measured 

values in function of the surface electric field F, we assumed that F=β.V with β equal to 200000 

m-1  (tip  radius  of  one  micrometer  as  mentioned  above)  and  V  the  voltage  between  tip  and 

faraday  cup.  Figure  9  shows  a  good  qualitative  agreement  between  the  photo-field  emission 

theory and the measurements. Higher electric fields give larger potential barrier reduction and 

thus more energy states accessible for photoemission. The quantitative fit in figure 9 has been 

obtained by assuming an emitting area of S=10µm2 which is compatible with the actual tip size.  

Conclusion 

 

 

 

FEAs with diameters below one millimeter and needle tips are two possible cathode types 

for a low emittance electron gun for an FEL application to generate 0.1 nm X-rays. The first 

requirement for such an application is that a minimum peak current of 5.5 A must be emitted. 

Nanoseconds long current pulses of 0.12 A and 0.58 A have been successfully extracted from 

8

FEAs  and  single  tip  cathodes  respectively.  This  represents  an  encouraging  step  towards  our 

goal of 5 A in 15ps. In order to bunch the electron emission down to the picoseconds region, 

laser  assistance  seems  to  be  an  attractive  solution  according  to  the  results  presented  in  this 

paper. Such a photo-field emitter source acts like a photocathode with very high quantum yield 

at long wavelength (>532nm).

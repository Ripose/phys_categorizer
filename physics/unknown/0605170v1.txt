Abstract 
 
Records  of  Dst,  Kp  and  Sym–H  indexes  are  analyzed  looking  for  evidences  of 

possible precursors for magnetic storms. For this the main magnetic storms were 

located and some periods immediately before storms and some periods well before 

them studied. Statistical properties of both types of periods were then compared. In 

particular, were compared the slopes of the power laws that have been found for 

the  distributions  of  index  values.  A  systematic  deviation  was  found  between  both 

distributions  for  the  Kp  index.  It  was  not  so  for  Dst  and  Sym-H  indexes.  For  the 

three  indexes  it  was  found  a  correlation  between  slopes  and  the  corresponding 

storm intensity, which could serve as a probabilistic approach to magnetic storms 

forecasting.  The data for the analysis was obtained at the World Data Centre for 

Geomagnetism at Kyoto.

Introduction 
 

Geomagnetic storms are (together with geomagnetic reversals [Ponte-Neto 

and  Papa,  2006])  the  most  striking  phenomena  in  the  magnetic  field  that  we  can 

measure  at  the  Earth’s  surface.  They  are  periods  from  one  to  three  days  during 

which  the  magnetic  field  born  at  the  Sun  surface  and  atmosphere  of  the  Earth 

presents  strong  variations.  Those  variations  seriously  affect  telecommunication 

transmissions. There are some evidences that during magnetic storms the number 

of heart attacks increases in relation to calm periods [Halberg et al., 2001]. During 

the year of 1989 the region of Quebec, in Canada, suffered a total energy blackout 

for more than nine hours caused by a strong magnetic storm. Geomagnetic storms 

may also affect the development of other technical and commercial activities as, for 

example,  measurements  of  crustal  magnetic  fields  for  prospecting  and  directional 

drilling [Gleisner et al., 2005]. All these reasons justify the search for methods that 

allow  predict  magnetic  storms  with  enough  antecedence.  But  as  in  the  case  of 

earthquakes  and  other  catastrophic  events  that  affect  human  activities  (or  even, 

the human life) there do not exist yet methods to accomplish this task in a reliable 

manner.    

During  the  last  five  decades  many  efforts  have  been  devoted  to  study 

statistical  properties  of  magnetic  measurements  at  the  Earth’s  surface  and 

satellites.  We  can  mention,  among  many  others,  a  power  spectrum  for  the 

magnetic  field  around  the  world  [Alldredge  et  al.,  1963],  and  more  recently,  a 

detrended 

fluctuation  analysis 

for 

the  Sym-H 

index 

[Wanliss,  2005],  an 

intermittency  analysis  of  geomagnetic  storm  series  [Bolzan  et  al.,  2005]  and  a 

Fourier  filtering  procedure  to  study  statistical  signatures  of  direct  magnetic  field 

measurements [Papa et al., 2006]. 

The  search  for  geomagnetic  storms  precursors  range  from  some  Earth 

grounded systems as, for example, muon detectors [Jansen et al., 2001], to some 

Earth  and  satellites  studies  on  visible  light  and  X-ray  burst  during  solar  flares 

[Yermolaev and Yermolaev, 2003]. However, there are some discrepancies on the 

effective  relation  between  solar  flares  and  geomagnetic  storms  [Yermolaev  and 

Yermolaev,  2006]  and  this  is  a  point  of  current  discussion.  There  is  a 

comprehensible  review  [Lathuillère  et  al.,  2002]  on  scientific  models  for  space 

weather developments. We have not found works searching for precursor using the 

fractal properties of actual geomagnetic measurements or their related indexes.  

On the other hand, magnetic storms are themselves possible candidates to 

precursors  of  other  geophysical  phenomena  like  earthquakes  [Enescu,  2005; 

Kushwah, 2004] but as well as in the case of flare-storms relations this possibility 

requires further scrutiny.    

When preparing this work we were mostly inspired on the works by Wanliss 

[2005]  and  by  Papa et al. [2006]. However our work follows well defined different 

lines.  Wanliss  [2005]  concentrated  on  an  extensive  study  (from  1981  to  2000)  of 

fractal properties of the Sym-H index dividing the record in quiet (periods of at least 

1000  minutes  of  Kp  less  or  equal  to  1)  and  active  intervals  (periods  of  at  least 

10000 minutes of Kp greater or equal to 4). On the other hand, Papa et al. [2006] 

concentrated their efforts in studying a short period of time (October 2000) through 

a Fourier analysis of magnetic measurements that overcome some of the problems 

that  emerge  because  the  non-stationary  character  of  those  series.  None  of  them 

focused  its  attention  in  the  search  for  magnetic  storms  precursors.  Here  we  are 

interested in compare fractal properties but only of relatively calm periods, some of 

them  near  magnetic  storms’  beginnings  and  some  others  far  (see  below)  from 

magnetic storms.     

 

Data analysis and Preparation 

The 1-hour-resolution Dst index, which is essentially the same as the minute 

Sym-H index except for the time resolution, is usually taken as the magnetic storm 

revealer.  It  is  often  taken  the  value  –50nT  of  that  index  as  the  threshold  for 

considering  that  a  magnetic  storm  is  taken  place  [Maltsev,  2003].  In  Figure  1  we 

present the variation of the Dst index for the month of October 2000. The data was 

obtained  from  the  World  Data  Centre  for  Geomagnetism  at  Kyoto  (WDC). 

Analyzing Figure 1 and other one-month periods (not shown) it is apparent that the 

unique general feature for the series is that does not exist any general feature for 

it.  However,  there  are  two  characteristics  that  are  present  in  a  considerable 

number of cases: a sudden decrease in Dst values (during a few hours) and a slow 

recover  to  values  near  zero  during  a  period  of  one  to  three  days.    On  those 

features was based our data preparation. 

It is well known that the Dst series present a highly non-stationary character. 

To avoid problems resulting from this fact there are two customary policies that are 

implemented. The first studies long periods of time searching for robust averages 

[Wanliss,  2005].  The  second  studies  short  periods  of  time,  where  a  quasi-

stationary   character can be assumed. It was our choice the last one. 

The  preparation  of  data  consists  in  a  set  of  relatively  simple  steps  that  we 

describe now. We have used as threshold criteria for the beginning of a magnetic 

storm a value of –50nT for the Dst index. With this, we have located the date and 

hour  of  the  beginning  of  all  the  magnetic  storms  in  the  period  1998–2002.  The 

beginning of the transient before storms was estimated to be the last value greater 

or  equal  to  –10nT  before  the  value  less  or  equal  to  –50nT  that  marks  the  storm 

beginning. We have not considered transient periods greater than 10 hours and the 

corresponding “storm” does not enter our record. They were considered walking of 

Dst in far from zero values or rests of previous storms. The mean value for those 

periods corresponds to around 6 hours, and this value was taken as unique for all 

the storms. It is clear that not all the periods with values greater or equal to –50nT 

classify as storm with those criteria. We have also eliminated from our record the 

periods of Dst less than –50nT too close to previous storms (because we can not 

have a “clean” six days plus six hours period for our calculations, see below). The 

final  result  was  that  we  eliminated  around  50%  of  the  periods  with  some  point  at 

Dst values lower than –50nT, giving 60 magnetic storms. Table 1 presents the set 

of storms that we have considered. We have investigated then two time windows of 

three days: the three consecutive days before the transient beginning and the three 

consecutive  days  before  them.  On  both  types  of  periods  we  have  implemented  a 

fluctuation  analysis.  Three  days  seems  to  be  a  reasonable  period  for  storms 

forecasting [Gleisner et al., 2005]. 

Figure 2 shows the distributions of Dst, Kp and Sym-H values for a month period 

(October  2000).  All  of  them  follow  power  laws  with  a  given  slope.  The  change  of 

slope  from  one  type  of  period  to  the  other  will  be  the  focus  of  our  attention.  We 

have calculated the distribution function for Dst, Kp and Sym-H values for each of 

those  three  days  periods.  Note  however  that  this  is  a  quite  dangerous  strategy 

because  we  have  small  samples  and,  consequently,  low  quality  power  laws.  The 

analysis was done in periods of three days while in Figure 2 the plots are for one 

month. These means that, instead of 240 data points for Kp, for example, there are 

only 24 points, and similarly for the other two indexes. Among all of them Kp is the 

more critical one (because is the temporarily less dense index). This was an extra 

motive  to  a  further  reduction  in  the  set  of  magnetic  storms  to  be  considered  for 

each  of  the  indexes.  Once  calculated  the  slope  and  its  error  for  both  periods 

corresponding to a single storm it was established a threshold for the error. When 

the error was above this threshold the corresponding storm was dropped out of the 

initial  set  of  60  in  Table  1,  for  that  index.  The  thresholds  for  Dst,  Kp  and  Sym-H 

indexes were 30%, 50% and 30%, respectively. With this the number of effectively 

used storms was reduced to 39 for Dst, 26 for Kp and 43 for Sym-H. 

 

Results and Discussion 

It  is  well  known  that  the  magnetic  field  measurement  distributions  [Papa  et  al., 

2006] as well as some index distributions [Wanliss, 2005] present power laws or, in 

other words, are compatible with some fractal system. Power laws have the form:  

( )
xf

.=

dxk

                                                          (1) 

where  f(x)  is  the  frequency  distribution  on  the  variable  x,  k  is  a  proportionality 

constant and d is the exponent of the power law. 

Figure 3 shows the slope d distribution for Dst, Kp and Sym-H indexes. For Dst, as 

well  as  for  Sym-H,  there  are  no  statistically  relevant  differences  between  the 

distributions for periods near and far from storms. For Kp it is apparent a trend to 

lower  values  of  the  power  law  exponent  distribution  when  we  consider  periods 

closer  to  storms.  We  expected  the  results  for  Dst  and  Sym-H  be  similar  because 

they are essentially the same except for the time resolution.  

That there are not relevant differences (the difference in Kp must be caused by the 

low  statistics)  between  both  types  of  periods  could  be  expected  from  previous 

results  [Wanliss,  2005;  Papa  et  al.,  2006]  on  the  fractal  character  of  those 

distributions: they are, in principle, indistinguishable.  

The dependence on time of the slope for the whole period 1998-2002 is shown in 

Figure  4  for  the  three  indexes.  While  there  is  not  a  one-to-one  correspondence 

between the slopes of periods corresponding to a single storm, it can be noted that 

there is a global trend in Dst (increasing with time) and Sym-H (decreasing as time 

goes  by)  indexes.  For  Kp  it  was  not  possible  to  establish  a  unique  trend  for  both 

dependences. 

In  Figure  5  we  present  the  correlation  between  the  slopes  for  both  periods  (near 

and  far).  There  is  not  an  apparent  correlation  for  none  of  the  indexes.  However, 

there seems to be “forbidden areas” in all of them. For example, in Figure 5b, for 

Kp, a d (far from storm) value lower than –0.4 excludes the occurrence of values 

lower than –0.5 for d (near storm). 

The analysis presented so far does not involve the possibility of storms prediction. 

It was more oriented to characterize changes in the statistical properties of indexes 

from one type of period to the other.  In Figure 5 it is shown the dependence of d 

for both periods on the corresponding storm intensity. There are forbidden regions 

in all the cases. When we try to predict some phenomenon forbidden regions are 

important.  Although  they  do  not  say  what  is  going  to  happen,  they  tell  us  what  is 

not going to occur. They can also provide us with the probability that a given event 

happen. Let us briefly exemplify both affirmations. From Figure 6a for index Dst we 

could say that if the exponent of the power law (for any of the periods) is lower than 

–3.5 then the next storm will be no more intense than –125nT. From Figure 6a we 

can also extract that if the exponent (for a near period) is between –2.5 and 0 there 

is  a  probability  of  6/21  ≅  30%  for  the  next  storm  of  being  more  intense  than  –

125nT.  The  quantity  6/21  was  obtained  by  noting  that  there  are  6  points  in  the 

rectangle formed by the values d = –2.5 and 0 and storm intensity = –325nT and –

125nT, and 21 points in the rectangle formed by the same values for d and storm 

intensity = –125nT and –25nT.  

It  should  be  noted  in  Figure  6  that  forbidden  regions  delimited  by  points 

corresponding  to  periods  near  storms  (circles)  are  larger  than  those  delimited  by 

points  corresponding  to  periods  far  from  storms.  They  impose  more  restrictive 

conditions.  This  is  intuitively  clear,  if  we  accept,  as  it  seems  to  be,  that  there  is 

some  relevant  information  on  the  storms  in  periods  before  them.  The  closer  the 

analyzed  period  to  the  storm  the  more  reliable  information  we  have  on  it.  The 

existence  of  correlations  between  slopes  and  storm  intensities  means  that, 

although the system has a partial fractal character, there are components of other 

types of phenomena that allow this correlation.   

We consider the forbidden regions in d versus storm-intensity plots our main result. 

Conclusions 

We have studied the change in fractal properties of magnetic indexes of wide use. 

There are several things to be learnt from our study. Our mean time for transients 

before storms is a first order approximation (note that the variation ranges from 3 to 

10  hours).  Probably  a  case-by-case  study  will  give  more  reliable  results.  Our 

studies  do  not  included  some  storms  close  to  previous  ones.  A  possible  way  to 

include those cases would be to implement a similar procedure in the long tail part 

of the storms. Multi-peak storm stayed also out of our scope and we have no idea 

on  how  to  extend  our  study  to  include  them.  They  seem  to  be  stresses  not 

completely  relaxed  during  the  main  phase  (first  peak)  of  the  storm.  In  any  case, 

further and more detailed studies will be necessary. A better statistics (that in our 

case  means  longer  periods  of  time)  would  be  necessary.  The  inverse  way  of 

validation is also mandatory. There are some works running in those directions and 

will be published elsewhere.

Abstract.  A pair of Kirchhoff-loop-Johnson(-like)-Noise (KLJN) Communicators was designed
and built for variable ranges. The experiments were carried out on a model-line with ranges up to
200 km and that is beyond the range of quantum communicators. This simple initial device has
bit rates of 1, 10, and 100 bit/second for ranges 200, 20 and 1 km.

A  pair  of  Kirchhoff-loop-Johnson(-like)-Noise  (KLJN)  Communicators  [1-4]  was
designed  and  built  for  variable  ranges.  The  KLJN  communicator  pair  was  realized  by
Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and analog technology, see Figure 1. The experiments
were carried out on a model-line with ranges up to 200 km and that is beyond the range
of  quantum  communicators.  This  simple  initial  device  has  bit  rates  of  1,  10,  and  100
bit/second for ranges 200, 20 and 1 km.

The noise is Johnson-like noise with power density spectrum

within the noise bandwidth and zero out of the noise bandwidth. The resistors at Alice
and Bob are 2 and 10 kOhm. The value of K for the different ranges is given in Figure 2.
It is selected so that the noise voltage was 1 Volt in all cases.

The  parameters  of  the  model  line  and  the  corresponding  real  wire  characteristics,  the
standing wave limits and noise bandwidths are shown in Figure 2. At this arrangement,
the influence of parasitic capacitance and inductance are negligible.

Wave effects in the stationary mode and information leak due to them are avoided by the
proper selection of the noise bandwidth. Wave effects due to transients at the end of clock
period are avoided by driving the noise voltage and current to zero before the switching.
This  noise  voltage  decay  is  made  with  a  proper  time-function  envelope  so  that  the
produced Fourier components are within the actual noise bandwidth.

line is a model line with capacitance compensation up to 200 km range.

during operation. Alice and Bob must decide about the distribution functions at the middle and at the right
in each window to find out if secure bit exchange is taking place or not.

Work is in hand to enhance the speed of the system by a factor of 10 from which a factor
of  5  is  straightforward  (larger  difference  between  the  resistances)  and  the  remaining
factor of 2 will utilize proper statistical measures.

The travel of LBK to the University of Szeged for the startup phase of the experiments
was covered by the Swedish STINT foundation and the cost of staying (10-15 December,
2006) was partially covered by the European Union's SANES grant.

Abstract 

The  LIGO  Interferometer  Sensing  and  Control 
System (ISC) is a large and highly distributed Multiple 
Input  Multiple  Output  (MIMO)  control  system  that  is 
used  to  control  the  length  and  alignment  degrees  of 
freedom of the interferometers. The 4 kilometer Fabry-
Perot  cavity  lengths  are  controlled  to  better  than  10-13 
meters  (rms)  and  the  angular  degrees  of  freedom  are 
controlled  to  better  than  10-8  radians.  This  paper  will 
describe the real-time digital servo control systems that 
have  been  designed,  developed  and  implemented  for 
the  LIGO  Length  Sensing  and  Control  (LSC)  [1]  and 
Alignment  Sensing  and  Control  (ASC)  [2]  systems. In 
addition,  the  paper  will  describe  how  these  controls, 
along with the suspended optic controls [3], have been 
integrated  into  the  overall  LIGO  control  and  data 
acquisition system [4]. 

1 INTRODUCTION 
located 

The  LIGO 

interferometers 

in  Hanford, 
Washington  and  Livingston,  Louisiana  are  Michelson 
laser  interferometers  enhanced  by  multiple  coupled 
optical resonators. These coupled optical resonators are 
4  kilometer  long  Fabry-Perot  cavities  in  each  arm  of 
the  interferometer.  The  mirrors  that  form  the  cavities 
are  suspended  from  a  single  loop  of  wire  mounted 
inside  suspension  cages  that  are,  in  turn,  mounted  on 
seismically  isolated  optical  platforms within the LIGO 
vacuum system. Control of the optic is achieved using 
voice coil actuators that act on magnets attached to the 
surface  of  each  optic.  Shadow  sensors  are  used  to 
measure  movement  and  orientation  of  the  optic  with 
respect to the suspension cage. This “local” damping of 
each  optic  is  not sufficient to keep the optical cavities 
of  the  interferometer  on  resonance  in  the  presence  of 
disturbances.  It  is  the  function  of  the  LSC  and  ASC 
systems to actively control the length and alignment of 
the  optical  cavities  with  respect  to  the  “on  resonance” 
condition. Figure 1 shows the LSC photodetectors and 
ASC  wavefront 
(WFS)  and  Quadrant 
photodetectors  (QPDX,  QPDY)  in  relation  to  the 
interferometer optical components. 

sensors 

There are many components that are common to both 
the LSC and ASC. The length and alignment degrees of 
freedom  are  detected  and  controlled  by  impressing 
phase modulated radio frequency sidebands on the light 
injected  into  the  interferometer.  Tuned  photodetectors

Outputs from the LSC and ASC systems are handled 
by  the  suspension  control  system  as  described  in  [3]. 
The  interface  to  the  suspension  controls  is  via  fiber 
optic reflective memory links. There are three reflective 
memory  loops  for  the  ASC  and  LSC  controls,  one for 
each  arm  of  the  interferometer  and  one  for  the  corner 
station.  The  loop  to  each  arm  is  used  to  pass  data 
between  front  end  systems  in  the  corner  station  and 
each end station. A loop is used for each arm in order 
to  minimize  and  balance  the  13-microsecond  delay 
caused  by  the  speed  of  light  transit  time  of  the  4-
kilometer arms. The loop in the corner station is used to 
pass data between LSC, ASC and suspension front end 
CPUs  located  at  the  interferometer  vertex.  In  addition 
there is a reflective memory network for the LIGO data 
acquisition system. Each node of a particular reflective 

memory  network  is  connected  in  a  loop  using  single 
mode  or  multi-mode  fiber.  Data  written  to  a  memory 
location at one node is passed to each node in the loop. 
In this way data can be shared among nodes. 

The  analog  electronics  are  very  low  noise  (1-
2nV/√Hz  input  referred)  and  housed  in  6U  height 
Eurocard  format  crates  in  the  ISC  control  racks.  All 
ADCs,  DACs,  processors  and  other  commercial 
equipment  are  VME.  The  timing  for  the  ADCs  and 
the  same  GPS  (Global 
DACs 
Positioning  System)  based  timing  system  used  by  the 
LIGO data acquisition system [4].

2 LENGTH SENSING AND CONTROL 
Figure  3  is  a  block  diagram  of  the  length  control 
signal  paths  from  each  of  the  LSC  photodetectors  to 
each of the interferometer optics. As can be seen for the 
figure  the  length control system is a highly distributed 
multi-input,  multi-output 
servo  control 
system.

anti-symmetric, pick-off and reflected photodetectors 
(AS, PO, REF, respectively) to each optic. 
 

The 

in-phase 

(I)  and  quadrature-phase 

(Q) 
component of each photodetector are demodulated and 
passed  through  a  software  block  that  can  offset  the 
overall  phase  of  each  signal.  These  phase  adjusted 
signals are passed to the input matrix where each of the 
degrees  of  freedom  to  be  controlled  are  calculated. 
These  degrees  of  freedom  are  differential  arm  length 
(DARM),  michelson  length  (MICH),  power  recycling 
cavity length (PRC) and common arm length (CARM), 
shown  top  to  bottom,  respectively  in  figure  3.  Each 
degree of freedom is then filtered. The filters shown in 
figure 3 represent a block of code the can contain up to 

 
10 infinite impulse response (IIR) filters. Each of these 
filters  can  contain  up  to  4  second  order  sections  and 
each  filter  can  be  enabled  or  bypassed  on  the  fly. 
Coefficients  for  each  of  the  filters  are  read  from  a 
modifiable text filter on system startup, but an effort is 
currently under way to allow the coefficients file to be 
read  and  reloaded  without  restarting  the  system. 
Following the filters the signal is passed to an operator 
adjustable  gain  stage  and  then  on  to  the  output  matrix 
where  the  appropriate  actuation  signals  are  produced. 
These  actuation  signals  are  passed  via  reflective 
memory  to  the  digital  suspension  controls,  which  then 
add the signals to the appropriate degrees of freedom of 
each  optic  (ETMX,  ETMY,  ITMX,  ITMY,  BS  and 
RCM)  as  described  in  [3].  Also  shown  in  figure  3 are 
the  points  at  which  GDS  (Global  Diagnostic  System) 
excitation  signals  (EXC)  can  be  added  into  the  signal 
path.  These  signals  are  used  by  the  operators  to 
measure  transfer  functions,  and  run  other  diagnostic 
tests as described in [4]. 

Not shown in figure 3 is the connection between the 
real-time servo calculations and the interferometer lock 
acquisition code [5]. The lock acquisition code looks at 
data  from  the  system  and  determines  in  real  time  the 
filters, gains, etc. required to bring the optical cavities 
of the interferometer into resonance. 

All sampling and servo calculations for the LSC are 
performed  at  16,384Hz,  the  maximum  sample  rate  for 
LIGO.  This  sample  rate  is  necessary  because  many  of 
the LSC servos have unity gain bandwidths greater than 
100Hz.  In  addition,  data  collected  and  processed  by  a 
CPU located in the vertex area may be used to drive an 
optic  located  in  one  of  the  end  stations.  For  these 
situations, the 13 microseconds required to transit the 4 
kilometer  arms,  must  be  taken  into  account  when  the 
servos are designed. 

3 ALIGNMENT SENSING AND 
CONTROL 
Figure 4 is a block diagram of the alignment control 
signal  paths  from  each  of  the  ASC  wavefront  sensor 
photodetectors  (WFS)  to  each  of  the  interferometer 
optics.  As  can  be  seen  from  the  figure,  the  ASC,  like 
the  LSC,  is  a  highly  distributed  MIMO  servo  control 
system.  Not  shown  in  the  figure  are  the  connections 
from  each  of  the  QPDs  located  in  the  end  stations  to 
steering optics located in the interferometer vertex.

Figure  4:  Alignment  controls  showing  signal  paths 

from each wavefront photodetector to each optic 

 
Each  of  the  WFS  and  QPD  photodetectors  are  a  4 
segment  detector.  Each  segment  of  the  detector  is 
processed  individually  and  then  used  to  determine 
beam pointing (pitch and yaw). One difference between 
the  WFS  and  the  QPD  is  that  the  WFS  is  sensitive  to 
the  RF  sideband  modulation 
the 
interferometer  light  and  the  QPD  is  sensitive  to  the 
carrier. 

impressed  on 

As  can  be  seen  in  figure  4,  the  in-phase  (I)  and 
quadrature-phase  (Q)  of  each  WFS  are  detected  and 
used  to  determine  an  I  and  Q  phase  pitch  and  yaw 
signal for that WFS. Then, depending on which WFS it 
is,  the  I  and/or  Q  pitch  and  yaw  signals  are  passed  to 
operator adjustable gain stages and then to filters. The 
filters  shown  in  figure  4  represent  blocks  of  code  that 
can contain up to 10 IIR filters and each of these filters 
can  contain  up  to  4  second  order  sections.  Each  filter 
can be enabled or bypassed on the fly and like the LSC 
the  coefficients  for  each  of  the  filters  are  read  from  a 
text file on system startup. Following the filters, signals 
are  passed  to  an  output  matrix  where  the  actuation 
signals  for  each  of  the  interferometer  optics  are 
calculated.  These  actuation  signals  are  then  passed  to 
the  digital  suspension  controls  via  reflective  memory 
where  they  are  applied  to  the  appropriate  degrees  of 
freedom as described in [3]. 

One  difference  between  the  ASC  and  LSC  is  that 
data for the servos is collected in both the end stations 
and  the  vertex.  Data  collected  from  the  QPDs  in  the 
end  stations  is  passed  to  the  vertex  via  the  reflective 
memory  network  for  the  respective  arm  and  all  of  the 
calculations  for  the  beam  pointing  servo  are  done  by 
the  CPU  in  the  vertex.  Also  shown  in figure 4 are the 
points  at  which  GDS  excitation  signals  (EXC)  can  be 
added  into  the  signal  path.  All  sampling  and  servo 
calculations for the ASC are performed at 2048Hz. 

 

4 INTERFACE TO DAQ, GDS AND 
EPICS 
The LIGO DAQ and GDS systems are interfaced via 
reflective  memory.  One  of  the  functions  of  the  vertex 
input  crate  is  to  read  and  write  data  from  and  to  this 
reflective  memory.  Using  the  DAQ  and  GDS  an 
operator  can  look  at  data  from  the  system,  measure 
input 
transfer  functions,  plot  power  spectra  and 
diagnostic  test  signals,  in  real  time.  A  more  complete 
description of the functions and operation of the DAQ 
and GDS systems are described in reference [4]. 

Routine  operator  interface  is  via  EPICS1.  Through 
EPICS,  the  operator  can  monitor  the  system,  change 
matrices,  gains  and  offsets,  engage  filters  and  invert 
servo polarity. A Motorola MVME 162 CPU is located 
in  each  of  the  LSC  and  ASC  front  end  VME  crates. 
This  CPU  processes  the  database  records,  state  code, 
etc.  for  the  controls  located  in  that  crate.  Data  is 
communicated  between  the  front  end  CPU  (Pentium 
III) and the EPICS CPU via shared memory across the 
VME backplane. This is done in an effort to minimize 
the burden on the front end CPU and allow it to handle 
only the time critical front end servo controls.

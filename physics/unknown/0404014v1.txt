ABSTRACT 

Recent  studies  of  DNA  sequence  of  letters  A,  C,  G  and  T 
exhibit the inverse power law form frequency spectrum. Inverse 
power-law  form  of  the  power  spectra  of  fractal  space-time 
fluctuations is generic to the dynamical systems in nature and is 
identified  as self-organized criticality.  In this study it  is  shown 
that  the  power  spectra  of  the  frequency  distributions  of  bases 
C+G in the Human chromosome X DNA exhibit self-organized 
criticality. DNA is a quasicrystal possessing maximum packing 
efficiency  in  a  hierarchy  of  spirals  or  loops.  Self-organized 
introns  may  not  be 
criticality 
redundant, but serve to organize the effective functioning of the 
coding exons in the DNA molecule as a complete unit.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Animate and inanimate structures in nature exhibit selfsimilarity 
in geometrical shape [1], i.e. parts resemble the whole object in 
shape. The most fundamental selfsimilar structure is the forking 
(bifurcating)  structure  of  tree  branches,  lung  architecture,  river 
tributaries, branched lightning, etc. The hierarchies  of complex 
represent  uniform  stretching  on  a 
branching  structures 
logarithmic  scale  and  belong  to  the  recently  identified  [2] 
category of fractal objects. The complex branching architecture 
is  a  selfsimilar  fractal  since  branching  occurs  on  all  scales 
(sizes)  and  forms  the  geometrical  shape  of  the  whole  object. 
The  substantial  identity  of  the  fractal  architecture  underlying 
leaf  and  branch  was  recognized  more  than  three  centuries  ago 
[3]. This type of scaling was used by D’Arcy Thompson [4] in 
scaling anatomical structures. It appears quite often in the form 
of  allometric  growth  laws  in  botany  as  well  as  in  biology  [5]. 
This  particular  kind  of  scaling  has  been  successfully  used  in 
biology  for  over  a  century.  The  universal  symmetry  of 
selfsimilarity  underlies  apparently  irregular  complex  structures 
in nature [6]. The study of fractals now belongs to the new field 
'nonlinear  dynamics  and  chaos',  a  multidisciplinary  area  of 
intensive research  in  all fields  of science in  recent years (since 
1980s) [7].  

Selfsimilar  growth,  ubiquitous  to  nature  is  therefore 
governed  by  universal  dynamical  laws,  which  are  independent 
of the exact details (chemical, physical, physiological, electrical 
etc.)  of  the  dynamical  system.  Dynamical  systems  in  nature 
2. MODEL CONCEPTS 

possess selfsimilar fractal geometry to the spatial pattern which 
support  fluctuations  of  processes  at  all  time  scales.  The 
temporal  fluctuations  of  dynamical  processes  are  also  scale 
invariant in time and are therefore temporal fractals. The fractal 
structure  to  the  spatial  pattern  was  pursued  as  an  independent 
multidisciplinary  area  of  research  since  late  1970s  when  the 
concept  of  fractals  was  introduced  by  Mandelbrot  [2].  Though 
the  scale  invariant  (selfsimilar)  characteristic  of  temporal 
fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems  has  a  longer  history  of 
observation  of  more  than  30  years  [8],  it  was  not  studied  in 
relation  to  the  associated  fractal  architecture  of  spatial  pattern 
till  as  late  as  1988.  The  unified  concept  of  space-time  fractals 
was identified as a signature of self-organized criticality by Bak 
et  al  [9].  For  example,  the  fluctuations  in  time  of  atmospheric 
flows,  as  recorded  by  meteorological  parameters  such  as 
pressure,  temperature,  wind  speed  etc.,  exhibit  selfsimilar 
fluctuations  in  time  namely,  a  zigzag  pattern  of  increase 
(decrease)  followed  by  a  decrease  (increase)  on  time  scales 
from  seconds  to  years.  Such  jagged  pattern  for  atmospheric 
the  selfsimilar  coastline 
variability  (temporal)  resembles 
long-range 
(spatial) 
correlations, 
long-term 
fluctuations are related to each other by a non-dimensional scale 
factor  alone.  Therefore,  dynamical  laws  which  govern  the 
(turbulence, 
space-time 
millimeters-seconds)  fluctuations  in  space-time  also  apply  for 
the largest scale (planetary, thousands of kilometers - years) in 
atmospheric flows throughout the globe.

Biological  systems  exhibit  high  degree  of  co-
operation  in  the  form  of  long-range  communication.  The 
concept  of  co-operative  existence  of  fluctuations 
the 
organization  of  coherent  structures  has  been  identified  as 
selforganized  co-operative  phenomena  [10]  and  synergetics 
[11].  The  physics  of  self-organized  criticality  exhibited  by 
dynamical  systems  in  nature  is  not  yet  identified.  Selvam  [12] 
has  developed  a  cell  dynamical  system  model  for  atmospheric 
flows which shows that the observed long-range spatiotemporal 
correlations  namely,  self-organized  criticality  are  intrinsic  to 
quantumlike  mechanics  governing  turbulent  flow  dynamics. 
The  model  concepts  are  independent  of  the  exact  details,  such 
as  the  chemical,  physical,  physiological,  etc.  properties  of  the 
dynamical  systems  and  therefore  provide  a  general  systems 
theory  [13,14,1,15]  applicable  for  all  dynamical  systems  in 
nature.

internal  structure. 

Power  spectra  of  fractal  space-time  fluctuations  of  dynamical 
systems  such  as  fluid  flows,  stock  market  price  fluctuations, 
heart  beat  patterns,  etc.,  exhibit  inverse  power-law  form 
identified  as  self-organized  criticality  [9]  and  represent  a 
selfsimilar  eddy  continuum.  Li  (2004)[16]  has  given  an 
extensive  and  informative  bibliography  of  the  observed  1/f 
noise, where f is the frequency, in biological, physical, chemical 
and  other  dynamical  systems.  A  general  systems  theory 
[12,17,18]  developed  by  the  author  shows  that  such  an  eddy 
continuum  can  be  visualised  as  a  hierarchy  of  successively 
larger  scale  eddies  enclosing  smaller  scale  eddies.  Since  the 
large eddy is the integrated mean of the enclosed smaller eddies, 
the  eddy  energy  (variance)  spectrum  follows  the  statistical 
normal  distribution  according  to  the  Central  Limit  Theorem 
[19].  Hence  the  additive  amplitudes  of  eddies,  when  squared, 
represent the probabilities, which is also an observed feature of 
the  subatomic  dynamics  of  quantum  systems  such  as  the 
electron or photon [20,21]. The long-range correlations intrinsic 
to self-organized criticality in dynamical systems are signatures 
following 
of  quantumlike  chaos  associated  with 
characteristics: (a) The fractal fluctuations result from an overall 
logarithmic  spiral  trajectory  with  the  quasiperiodic  Penrose 
tiling  pattern 
(b) 
Conventional  continuous  periodogram  power  spectral  analyses 
trajectories  will  reveal  a  continuum  of 
of  such  spiral 
wavelengths  with  progressive  increase  in  phase.  (c)  The 
broadband  power  spectrum  will  have  embedded  dominant 
wavebands, the bandwidth increasing with wavelength, and the 
wavelengths  being  functions  of  the  golden  mean.  The  first  13 
values  of  the  model  predicted  [12,17,18]  dominant  peak 
wavelengths are 2.2, 3.6, 5.8, 9.5, 15.3, 24.8, 40.1, 64.9, 105.0, 
167.0,  275,  445.0  and  720  in  units  of  the  block  length  10bp 
(base pairs) in the present study. Wavelengths (or periodicities) 
close  to  the  model  predicted  values  have  been  reported  in 
weather and climate variability [15], prime number distribution 
[22],  Riemann  zeta  zeros  (non-trivial)  distribution  [23],  stock 
market  economics  [24,25],  DNA  base  sequence  structure  [26]. 
(d)  The  conventional  power  spectrum  plotted  as  the  variance 
versus  the  frequency  in  log-log  scale  will  now  represent  the 
eddy  probability  density  on  logarithmic  scale  versus  the 
standard deviation of the eddy fluctuations on linear scale since 
the  logarithm  of  the  eddy  wavelength  represents  the  standard 
deviation,  i.e.  the  r.m.s  (root  mean  square)  value  of  the  eddy 
fluctuations.  The  r.m.s.  value  of  the  eddy  fluctuations  can  be 
represented in terms of statistical normal distribution as follows. 
A normalized standard deviation t=0 corresponds to cumulative 
percentage probability density equal to 50 for the mean value of 
the distribution. For the overall logarithmic spiral circulation the 
logarithm of the wavelength represents the r.m.s. value of eddy 
fluctuations  and  the  normalized  standard  deviation  t  is  defined 
for the eddy energy as

The parameter L in Eq. 1 is the wavelength and T50 is

the  cumulative  percentage

variable  logeT50  also  represents  the  mean  value  for  the  r.m.s. 
eddy fluctuations and is consistent with the concept of the mean 
level  represented  by  r.m.s.  eddy  fluctuations.  Spectra  of  time 
series  of  fluctuations  of  dynamical  systems,  for  example, 
meteorological  parameters,  when  plotted  as  cumulative 
percentage  contribution  to  total  variance  versus  t  follow  the 

model predicted universal spectrum [17; see all references under 
Selvam]. 

3. DATA AND ANALYSIS 

The  Human  chromosome  X  DNA  base  sequence  was  obtained 
from  the  entrez  Databases,  Homo  sapiens  Genome  (build  34, 
version  1)  at  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez.  The  first  4 
contiguous  data  sets  (Table  1)  were  chosen  for  the  study.  The 
number  of  times  base C and  also  base  G, i.e., (C+G),  occur  in 
successive  blocks  of  10  bases  were  determined  in  successive 
length  sections  of  70000  base  pairs  giving  a  series  of  7000 
values  for  each  data  set  giving  respectively  10,  8  and  19  data 
sets  for  the  contiguous  data  sets  2  to  4.  A  data  series  of  8652 
C+G concentration per successive 10 bp values was used for the 
short contiguous data set 1.  

The  power  spectra  of  frequency  distribution  of  bases 
were computed accurately by an elementary, but very powerful 
method of analysis developed by Jenkinson [27] which provides 
a  quasi-continuous  form  of  the  classical  periodogram  allowing 
systematic  allocation  of  the  total  variance  and  degrees  of 
freedom of the data series to logarithmically spaced elements of 
the  frequency  range  (0.5,  0).  The  cumulative  percentage 
contribution  to  total  variance  was  computed  starting  from  the 
high  frequency  side  of  the  spectrum.  The  power  spectra  were 
plotted  as  cumulative  percentage  contribution  to  total  variance 
versus  the  normalized  standard  deviation  t.  The  average 
variance spectra for the  Human chromosome X DNA data sets 
(Table  1)  and  the  statistical  normal  distribution  are  shown  in 
Fig. 1. The 'goodness of fit' (statistical chi-square test) between 
the  variance  spectra  and  statistical  normal  distribution  is 
significant at less than or equal to 5% level for all the data sets 
(Table 1). 

The power spectra exhibit dominant wavebands where 
the  normalized  variance  is  equal  to  or  greater  than  1.  The 
dominant peak wavelengths were grouped into 13 class intervals 
2 - 3, 3 - 4, 4 - 6, 6 - 12, 12 - 20, 20 - 30, 30 - 50, 50 - 80, 80 – 
120, 120 – 200, 200 –  300, 300 – 600, 600 - 1000 (in units  of 
10bp  block  lengths)  to  include  the  model  predicted  dominant 
peak  length  scales  mentioned  earlier.  Average  class  interval-
wise  percentage  frequencies  of  occurrence  of  dominant 
wavelengths  are  shown  in  Fig.  2  along  with  the  percentage 
contribution 
interval 
corresponding to the normalised  standard deviation t computed 
from the average T50 (Fig. 2) for each data set. The average and 
standard  deviation  of  the  wavelength  T50  up  to  which  the 
cumulative percentage contribution to total variance is equal to 
50 are also shown in Fig. 2.

4. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 

The  limited  number  of  only  four  contiguous  data  sets  used  in 
the  present  study  give  the  following  results.  The  variance 
spectra for almost all the data sets exhibit the universal inverse 
power-law  form  1/fa  of  the  statistical  normal  distribution  (Fig. 
1)  where  f  is  the  frequency  and  the  spectral  slope  a  decreases 
with  increase  in  wavelength  and  approaches  1  for  long 
wavelengths.  The  above result is also seen in  Fig.  2 where the 
frequency 
interval-wise 
wavelength 
distribution  of  dominant  wavelengths  follow  closely 
the 
corresponding computed variation of percentage contribution to 
the total variance as given by the statistical normal distribution.

spatial  correlations  in  the  frequency  distributions  of  the  bases 
C+G  in  DNA.  Li  and  Holste  [28]  have  recently  identified 
universal  1/f  spectra  and  diverse  correlation  structures  in 
Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) content of human chromosomes. 
Microscopic-scale  quantum  systems  such  as  the  electron  or 
photon exhibit non-local connections or long-range correlations 
and  are  visualized  to  result  from  the  superimposition  of  a 
continuum  of  eddies.  Therefore,  by  analogy,  the  observed 
fractal  fluctuations  of  the  frequency  distributions  of  the  bases 
exhibit quantumlike chaos in the Human chromosome X DNA. 
The eddy continuum acts as a robust unified whole fuzzy logic 
network with  global response to local perturbations. Therefore, 
artificial modification of base sequence structure at any location 
may  have  significant  noticeable  effects  on  the  function  of  the 
DNA  molecule  as  a  whole.  Results  of  the  limited  number  of 
data  sets  in  this  study  indicates  that  the  presence  of  introns, 
which do not have meaningful code, may not be redundant, but 
may  serve  to  organize  the  effective  functioning  of  the  coding 
exons in the DNA molecule as a complete unit.

Figure  2:  Average  wavelength  class  interval-wise  percentage 
distribution  of  dominant  (normalized  variance  greater  than  1) 
wavelengths are given by line + star. The computed percentage 
contribution to the total variance for each class interval is given 
by  line  +  open  circle.  The  mean  and  standard  deviation  of  the 
wavelengths 
the  cumulative  percentage 
contribution to total variance is equal to 50 are also given in the 
figure.

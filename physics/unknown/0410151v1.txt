We  address  the  properties  and  dynamical  stability  of  one-dimensional  vector  lattice 

solitons  in  Kerr-type  cubic  medium  with  harmonic  transverse  modulation  of  refractive 

index. We discovered that unstable families of scalar lattice solitons can be stabilized via 

the cross-phase modulation (XPM) in the vector case. It was found that multi-humped 

vector solitons that are unstable in uniform media where XPM strength is higher than 

that of self-phase modulation, can also be stabilized by the lattice.

1. Introduction. Light propagation in media whose properties vary periodically in 

transverse direction exhibits a wealth of practically interesting phenomena including the 

formation  of  stable  localized  structures,  which  find  applications  in  many  branches  of 

modern  physics,  including  waves  in  molecular  chains  [1],  trapped  Bose-Einstein 

condensates  [2],  or  solids  [3].  In  nonlinear  optics  discrete  solitons  were  extensively 

studied and observed in periodic arrays of weakly coupled waveguides [4]. Such strongly 

localized  modes  might  be  used  to  test  all-optical  switching  and  routing  concepts. 

Recently it was shown that lattices constituted by continuous nonlinear media with an 

imprinted  harmonic  modulation  of  the  refractive  index  offer  a  number  of  additional 

opportunities  for  the  manipulation  of  light  signals  [5].  Scalar  solitons  in  the  harmonic 

lattices were observed in photorefractive crystals [6] and analyzed in Refs [7-8].

However, the interaction between several light waves can considerably enrich the 

dynamics of their propagation and open new perspectives for cross-stabilization and all-

optical soliton phenomena. In uniform media, two-component bright vector solitons were 

studied  for  coherent  [9]  and  incoherent  [10]  interactions.  Strongly  localized  vectorial 

discrete  modes  in  arrays  of  evanescently  coupled  waveguides  and  their  stability  were 

reported  in  Ref.  [11].  Very  recently  coupling  between  mutually  incoherent  solitons 

belonging  to  the  different  bands  of  transmission  spectrum  of  periodic  lattices  was 

discussed [12], while vector solitons were observed in AlGaAs nonlinear waveguide arrays 

[13].  However,  the  investigation  of  the  properties  and  stability  of  vector  solitons  in 

optical lattices, which can be qualitatively and quantitatively altered by variation of the 

properties of the lattice, is an open problem. 

In  this  work  we  perform  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  properties  and  dynamical 

stability of one-dimensional vector lattice solitons in both focusing and defocusing cubic 

media. We reveal that cross-phase-modulation (XPM) results in stabilization of even (in 

focusing  medium)  and  twisted  (in  defocusing  medium)  soliton  components  that  are 

known to be highly unstable in the scalar case. We show that, in contrast to solitons in 

uniform media, vector lattice solitons can be made stable if the XPM strength exceeds 

that  of  self-phase  modulation.  We  also  reveal  the  existence  of  stable  multi-humped 

vector complexes in which one component is stabilized by the lattice, while the other one 

is stabilized by XPM. 

2. Model. We address the propagation of coupled laser beams along the  ξ -axis in 

media  with  a  periodic  modulation  of  the  linear  refractive  index  in  the 

η

Notice  also  that  photorefractive  crystals  offer  new  possibilities  for  manipulation  of  the 

XPM coupling, by varying the polarization of the light beams or the elements of electro-

optic tensor involved [6]. Eqs (1) admit several conserved quantities including the total

  that  was  solved  numerically.  Scaling 

transformation  mentioned  above  predicts  changes  of  the  growth  rate  for  unstable 

solitons  with  identical  functional  profiles  supported  by  lattices  with  different  periods. 

For  example,  if  lattice  period  becomes  χ   times  smaller  then  respective  growth  rate 

increases  χ  times.

We start our analysis by recalling the properties of scalar lattice solitons. There 

exist  odd,  even,  and  twisted  scalar  lattice  solitons.  In  focusing  media  odd  solitons  are 

stable,  even  ones  are  unstable,  and  twisted  ones  are  stable  above  certain  energy 

threshold. Defocusing media supports stable odd and even solitons, but twisted solitons 

are  unstable.  The  simplest  vector  soliton  solutions  are  formed  at  b

1

b≤

2

, when the first and the second 

component  have  different  types  of  symmetry.  Below  we  focus  on  the  simplest  self-

sustained  structures,  having  twisted  first  component  w .  Such  vector  solitons  can  be 

1

classified according to field distribution in the second component. 

A. Odd solitons in focusing media. The properties of odd vector soliton in focusing 

media are summarized in Fig. 1 at C

1=

. At low energy flows the second component of 

odd  soliton  has  a  single  well-defined  maximum  coinciding  with  the  local  maximum  of 

( )R η

,  so  that  the  field  distribution  in  both  second and first components is asymmetric 

(Fig. 1(b)). There exist lower and upper cut-offs on b  at fixed b  and 

p

 (Fig. 1(a)). As 

1

2

 approaches upper cut-off, the second component develops two equal humps located on 

1b
neighboring lattice sites, it means that the odd vector soliton transforms into the even 

one. At lower cut-off odd soliton ceases to exist. Energy flow versus b  is shown in Fig. 

1

1(a) at fixed b  and 

p

. Energy flow drops off with growth of guiding parameter at fixed 

2

 and b . At U U

1b
vector  solitons  located  at  neighboring  sites.  The  area  of  existence  of  odd  soliton  first 

 odd vector soliton transforms into weakly coupled scalar and 

, → ∞

1,2

2

expands and then shrinks with growth of guiding parameter 

p

 (Fig. 1(c)) for fixed b , so 

2

odd solitons cease to exist, when the guiding parameter 

p

 exceeds the critical value. The 

width  of  existence  area  increases  with  growth  of  b .  Notice  that  there  are  lower 

2

threshold on b  for existence of odd solitons. 

2

B.  Even  solitons  in  focusing  media.  The  properties  of  even  vector  solitons 

(composed  from  twisted  first  and  even  second  components)  are  summarized  in  Fig.  2. 

 

4

Second  component  has  two  equal  intensity  maxima  located  on  neighboring  sites  (Fig. 

2(b)). Total energy flow decreases monotonically with growth of  b  at fixed  b , 

p

, and 

1

2

drops off with increase of 

p

 at fixed  b ,  b  (Fig. 2(a)). There are lower and upper cut-

1

2

offs  on  b .  At  lower  cut-off  w

0→

,  and  vector  soliton  transforms  into  even  scalar 

1

soliton, while at upper cut-off 

0

, and it converts into twisted scalar soliton. The 

1
2w →

existence area of even soliton expands with decrease of guiding parameter  p  and slightly 

changes with growth of b  (Fig. 2(c)). 

2

C. Soliton stability in focusing media. Results of stability analysis are summarized 

in  Figs.  1,  2.  We  have  found  that  odd  vector  solitons  are  stable  almost  in  the  whole 

domain of their existence (Fig.1 (c)), a result confirmed by numerical integration of Eqs 

(1) in the presence of input noise (Fig. 1(d)). The linear stability analysis also revealed 

existence  of  stability  bands  for  even  vector  solitons.  They  turn  to  be  stable  when  the 

amplitude  of  first  twisted  component  becomes  large  enough.  Therefore  XPM  can 

stabilize  the  otherwise  unstable  soliton  component.  This  is  one  of  the  most  important 

results of this work.  

Soliton  stabilization  occurs  because  of  local  increase  of  refractive  index  in 

neighboring  lattice  sites  created  by  stable  twisted  component  via  XPM.  This  local 

increase  prevents  even  component  from  decay  into  odd  one  under  action  of 

perturbations.  The  onset  of  stability  is  dictated  by  peak  amplitude  or  energy  U   of 

1

twisted  component,  ratio  U

1 /U 2

,  and  depth  of  optical  lattice  that  can  be  flexibly 

controlled in distinction from discrete systems. Since lower amplitudes are necessary to 

support  soliton-like  propagation  in  deeper  lattices,  stabilizing  action  of  twisted 

component via XPM and width of stability domain decreases with growth of  p . Notice 

that upper boundary of instability domain for even vector soliton coincides with upper 

cut-off  for  odd  one,  i.e.  latter  transform  into  stable  even  soliton  at  upper  cut-off.  Fig. 

2(d) illustrates stable propagation of even lattice soliton perturbed by noise. 

D.  Odd  and  even  solitons  in  defocusing  media.  Optical  lattices  in  defocusing 

media also support vector solitons, but those are typically wider than their counterparts 

in  focusing  media.  The  energy  flow  of  even  soliton  versus  b   is  depicted  in  Fig.  3(a), 

1

while Fig. 3(b) shows profile of such soliton. The energy flow increases with growth of  p  

at  fixed  b ,b .  Notice  that  in  defocusing  media  at  upper  cut-off  on  b ,  the  first 

1

2

1

component  vanishes  and  vector  soliton  transforms  into  even  scalar  one,  while  at  lower 

 

5

cut-off on b  second component vanishes and one gets twisted scalar soliton. The area of 

1

existence for even solitons at  ( ,
b p
1

)

 plane broadens with decrease of guiding parameter 

(Fig. 3(c)) at fixed b . The width of existence area on b  decreases linearly with growth 

1

2

of propagation constant b  at fixed , so that above certain threshold on b  even solitons 

p

2

2

cease to exist. We have also found odd vector solitons in defocusing medium (Fig. 3(e)). 

Its first component transforms into linear Bloch wave at the lower cut-off on  b , while 

1

the  second  one  remains  localized.  Odd  soliton  converts  into  the  stable  even  soliton  at 

upper cut-off on b . 

1

E.  Soliton  stability  in  defocusing  media.  Results  of  stability  analysis  are 

summarized  in  Fig.  3(c).  We  discovered  existence  of  stability  band  for  even  vector 

solitons.  Thus  in  defocusing  optical  media  twisted  first  component  (that  is  unstable 

alone)  can  be  stabilized  through  XPM  interaction  with  the  stable  even  second 

component.  The  cross-stabilization  takes  place  if  the  amplitude  of  second  even 

component is large enough, actually near the upper cut-off for existence. Stability area 

for  even  vector  solitons  shrinks  at  low 

p

.  Fig.  3(d)  shows  stable  propagation  of  even 

soliton  in  defocusing  media  in  the  presence  of  white  input  noise.  Stability  analysis  for 

odd solitons becomes complicated near lower cut-off (area of weak localization) but we 

have found that they are stable near upper edge of existence domain on  b  (Fig. 3(f)). 

1

The important result is that combined action of the lattice and XPM enables to stabilize 

vector  solitons  of  high  order,  to  be  perhaps  referred  to  as  vector  soliton  trains,  with 

complex multi-humped intensity profile, when one of component is a scalar soliton train. 

F. Impact of XPM strength on soliton stability. We also analyzed the impact of 

XPM strength on stability of vector lattice solitons. The most important result is that 

stability window for bright even lattice solitons exists at C

1≠

 (Fig. 4(a)) in contrast to 

the case of uniform media, where multi-humped vector solitons are unstable at C

1>

 in 

the entire domain of their existence, and the width of stability window can be increased 

with increase of lattice depth. Notice that even soliton component vanishes at lower cut-

off on b  at C
1

(cid:50)

1.03

 thus resulting in stabilization of vector soliton, while at C

1.03<

 

even component vanishes at upper cut-off (Fig. 4(a)). 

Stabilization via XPM is also possible when first soliton component is subject to 

influence  of  lattice  (

p

0≠

)  while  for  the  second  component  the  medium  is  uniform 

(

p =

0 ).  It  was  revealed  that  XPM  may  results  in  completely  stable  twisted-twisted 

 

6

soliton combination (Fig. 4(b)) that does not exist in uniform medium. In this case even 

weak  first  “lattice”  component  can  capture  and  stabilize  strong  second  “uniform” 

component. Existence and stability domains broaden with growth of lattice depth in first 

component (Fig. 4(c)). Because of alternating sign of “lattice” component in neighboring 

sites,  the  “uniform”  component  also  acquires  multi-humped  structure  (Fig.  4(e)),  but 

still shows stable propagation (Fig. 4(f)). 

4. Conclusions. In conclusion, we analyzed the properties of vector lattice solitons 

in cubic nonlinear media with harmonic transverse modulation of linear refractive index, 

and discovered that stable propagation sustained by XPM if possible even if one of the 

soliton components is otherwise unstable. Here we reported only the simplest examples 

of vector lattice solitons but results are expected to hold for more general settings and 

for  richer  field  distributions,  including  the  formation  of  stable  soliton  trains. We  stress 

that  the  combined  action  of  the  lattice  with  tunable  strength  and  XPM  offers 

opportunities  not  only  to  alter  the  quantitative  characteristics  of  solitons,  but  also  to 

control their qualitative features, including their topological structure and stability.

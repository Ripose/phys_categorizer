The  identification  of  stream  in  the  straight  pipe  as  a  flexible  rod  has  allowed  to 
present the criterion expression for determination of transition of the laminar flow 
regime  to  the  turbulent  as  a  loss  of  stability  of  the  rectilinear  static  structure  of 
translational motion of stream in pipe and its transition to the flexural-vortical dy-
namic structure of translational motion, just as a flexible rod buckling. The intro-
duced criterion allows to take into account an influencing of the inlet geometry, 
the pipe length, the flow velocity, and also of any physical factors on stability of 
the rectilinear flow structure. It is ascertained, that Reynolds' number is the num-
ber of local hydrodynamic similarity and it is displayed that one is constituent part 
of the introduced stability criterion. The developed approach to a problem of sta-
bility is applicable for a problem solving on internal flow and external streamline.

Introduction 
 
The fluid has such essential property as an intrastructural mobility in contrast to the solid body. 
In other words the number of degrees of freedom of the fluid motion is much more, than for the 
solid body. In this connection the description of the fluid motion is much more complicated than 
description of the solid body motion. In the beginning we shall view the liquid flow (for exam-
ple, water), remaining at that within framework of a mechanics. The preservation of volume is 
naturally for  liquid and at the same  time  the  liquid takes any shape, depending on the form of 
vessel  or  the  flowing  element,  in  which  one  is  contained.  The  phenomenon  of  transition  from 
rectilinear structure of laminar translational motion of liquid in pipe to vortical structure of tur-
bulent translational motion, is accompanied with increase of resistance to a motion, was ascer-
tained by experiment.  

This is, in basic, traditional information, on the basis of which the attempts of description of the 
considered phenomenon were undertaken during more than 100 years.  

«Many  hypotheses  are  offered  for  explanation  of  origin  of  a  turbulence,  often  very  witty  hy-
potheses from a mathematical point of view, however…» L. Prandtl [1]. 
Till now it is not ascertained: 

−  What is the turbulence from a physical point of view? 
−  What is the reason of origin of the turbulence? 

The unsolvability of these problems, having the obviously mechanical nature, causes necessity at 
least of short revision of experience accumulated in a mechanics during last about 400 years.  
At the beginning of the XVII century, G.Galilei has established some laws of the free motion of 
the solid body is thrown by bevel way to horizon in the gravity field. The first principle of me-
chanics was formulated on the basis of these experiments.

In 1641, Е.Torricelli has repeated the Galilei's experiments for the liquid free jets. These experi-
ments have shown fundamental uniformity of a free motion of the solid body and the liquid (wa-
ter) jets in the gravity field. So, the class of problems of mechanics under a title the ballistics was 
established. 

After invention of H.Pitot's instrument (1732), D-I.Bernoulli (1738) has expressed the thought: 
the correlation of the potential and kinetic energy in the water stream in pipe and a falling body 
is  identical.  In  the  middle  of  the  XIX  century  this  thought was  affirmed  by  J.Weissbach’s  and 
H.Darcy's experiment with such feature, that the contact interaction of stream with wall of pipe 
influences to the correlation of the potential and kinetic energy in stream and to the magnitude of 
the outflow velocity. Thus, the liquid stream is appeared capable, to a certain extent, to maintain 
the ballistic properties at motion in pipe.  

To the middle of the XIX century,  it  was  also revealed (G.Hagen 1839, 1854), that the distur-
bance of rectilinear structure of a headway of stream happens during increase of the motion ve-
locity of the water stream in the straight pipe. 

To 1895 O.Reynolds has published results of his own experiments on investigation of the transi-
tion of motion of the water stream in the straight pipe from rectilinear to vortical structure. Rey-
nolds visualized the flow along its axis by injection of a tinctured jet and he determined, that the 
flow maintains rectilinear structure of motion at low velocities, and the vortical structure of flow 
appears at the certain high velocity. To determination of evocative transition, Reynolds offered 
the dimensionless expression linking the inertial forces of stream with forces of its viscosity. In 
accordance with Reynolds' expression, the transition of laminar structure of motion of the liquid 
stream  to  the  turbulent  happens  by  that  earlier,  than  more  the  velocity  of  fluid  (It  means,  in  a 
context of our comprehension, the more the intensity of the contact interaction of stream with a 
pipe wall, the earlier transition happens.) The pipe inlet in the Reynolds' experimental set up is 
realized in the form of the fluently convergent nozzle. Reynolds did not know apparently, that 
the inlet convergent mouthpiece can excite the initial turbulence despite of the smoothness of the 
streamlined contour because of high sensibility of it to an asymmetry of the inleakage. The simi-
lar inlet can provoke so-called «bath effect » in the kind of swirl of stream on inlet into pipe and 
the centrally disposed tinctured jet will not detect the swirl. 

In 1929 J.Nikuradse visualized the water stream in a straight chute and shown by means of the 
filming with cine-camera moved  along a stream, that the structure of motion of turbulent flow 
has  the  dynamic  flexural-vortical  character.  In 1933 Nikuradse  has presented  results of his ex-
periments by the water stream in pipes with a different roughness in the form of diagram in co-
ordinates «hydraulic friction coefficient - Reynolds' number». The transition of the laminar flow 
regime  to  the  turbulent  is  legibly  seen  on  this  diagram.  However  the  problem  is  remained  un-
closed: how can engineer use the diagrams of Nikuradse, Colebrook and White, Moody and the 
other, if the laminar flow regime in pipe can be within the limits 160

To  investigation  of  transition  of  the  laminar  flow  regime  to  the  turbulent,  the  experiments  are 
being  realized,  as  a  rule,  with  use  of  long  pipes  (up  to  2000  calibers  and  more).  For  example, 
J.M.T.  Thompson  has  utilized  an  almost  6-m  pipe  (more  than  910  calibers)  even  in  the  home 
conditions [2]. The next problem is: how does the pipe length influence on transition of the lami-
nar flow regime to turbulent? 

Only  to  the  end  of  the  XX  century,  the  guesses  about  the  mechanism  of  transition  of  laminar 
flow in the straight pipe to the turbulent as about phenomenon of a static buckling of the flexible 
solid body are arised. It was offered to compare the flow stability in the plastic curved pipe with 
the buckling of cylindrical or spherical shells [2].  

Alongside with it, on the other authoritative scientists opinion [3], «there  is the large group of 
problems on stability of the liquid jets. The problem of stability of the water jets (fountain, notice 
of the authors) in air is classical. In particular, what height can be reached by jet if an exit veloc-

 

3

ity and the jet diameter are assigned?» That is, in the end of the XX century, it is difficult to dis-
tinguish:  what  are  the  problems  of  ballistics  by  Galilei  -  Torricelli  and  what  are  the  problems 
about the contact interaction? 
 

Approach 
 
In view of above stated, it is necessary to return to consideration of motion of the free liquid jets 
in the gravity field. We shall watch the high-viscosity liquid jet, falling vertical, for example, of 
the melted bitumen at the temperature closely to a solidification point, to accumulative vessel in 
contrast to Torricelli's and Reynolds' experiments. We can ensure an outflowing jet with the cir-
cular cross-section and the flat jet. We can see that the circular cross-section jet deviates from the 
vertical because of gyration  and  one  is being packed by rings  at sufficient height of  falling, at 
contact  with  the  accumulative  vessel  bottom.  The  flat  jet  swings  similarly  to  a  pendulum  and, 
being bended, one is being packed up with formation of rouleau of the folds at contact with the 
above-mentioned  vessel  bottom.  We  observe  the  stability  loss  phenomenon  of  foot  of  the  free 
high-viscous  jet  similarly  to  the  flexible  rod  buckling  under  action  of  own  weight  in  these  ex-
periments. We note the dynamical character of the stability loss phenomenon of jet in contrast 
from the static buckling of flexible rod. We cannot detect the above-mentioned features at carry-
ing  out  of  the  same  experiment  with  the  falling  jets  of  water.  The  distinction  in  results  of  the 
compared experiments can be explained by influencing of viscosity. In this connection, the vis-
cosity is necessary to interpret not as the factor of tractive resistance, but as a physical property 
of  medium  to  conduct  the  mechanical  energy.  Viscosity  is  fluence  of  the  mechanical  energy, 
spreaded in mediums with the sound speed in accordance with dimensionality – kgf⋅ m/(m2⋅ s). 
The ratio of viscosity to the normal elastic modulus of medium in a direction of action of a me-
chanical energy determines a relaxation time:

Having multiplied the sound velocity in the jet material by a relaxation time, we find the height 
of foot of the free falling jet, which one not discontinuing the flowing, was turned into the flexi-
ble rod having the buckling under action of  own weight by L.Euler. The free falling jet of the 
low-viscosity liquid (for example, water) can not make such effect, as a height of action of an 
braking  impulse  for  its  practically  is  equal  to  a  zero  because  of  its  very  low  viscosity.  At  the 
same  time  the  conditions  for  loss  of  stability  of  rectilinear  structure  of  translational  motion  of 
stream as the flexible rod are being created at motion of the low-viscous stream (such as water) 
in  the  straight  pipe.  This  is  stipulated  by  that  the  pipe  walls,  constraining  the  static  head  of  a 
stream, transmit its along the stream with increase from the end of stream to its start. The conti-
nuity of static head along the pipe length and accordingly along the stream length transmutes the 
stream into the rod, loaded by the longitudinally allocated forces of the contact interaction with 
pipe. The straight pipe plays the dual role in the given situation: on the one hand, the pipe guides 
the  stream  and  shapes  the  form  of  the  straight  rod  to  it,  on  the  other  hand,  the  pipe  loads  the 
stream with longitudinal forces of the contact interaction with it and instigates thereby the loss of 
stability of rectilinear structure of translational motion of stream as a buckling of the flexible rod 
under action of own weight by Euler. By the way, Euler reached the correct formulation of prob-
lem about the elastic stability of the rod under action of own weight for 34 years (1744-1778) 
and exact solution of the problem is obtained after 150 years [4].  

Thus, the fluid can simultaneously be in state of translational motion and lose the stability of the 
static  rectilinear  structure  of  this  motion  similarly  to  the  flexible  rod,  because  of  the  greater 
number of degrees of freedom as contrast to solid body. At that the dynamic character of loss of 
stability detected in the above-mentioned experiments with the falling jets of high-viscous liquid 
is remained at motion of stream of low-viscous fluid in pipe. Moreover, the bending oscillations 

 

4

of stream of low-viscous fluid in pipe lead to the formation of vortices accompanying the transla-
tional  motion  of  stream.  The  described  pattern  of  motion  of  the  turbulent  stream  quite  corre-
sponds to the above-mentioned cinema sequences obtained by Nikuradse. 
 
Solution 
 
We  imagine  the  fluid  flow  core  in  pipe  in  the  form  of  the  straight  flexible  rod.  The  hydrody-
namic sublayer coating the roughness of the pipe wall and enveloping the stream core, loads the 
core by the axial (longitudinal) compressing forces of viscosity, distributed along the pipe length, 
but the sublayer is remained indefinitely compliant in radial direction and is assumed in the form 
of  the  clearance  space  between  the  stream  core  and  pipe.  We  receive  that  one  end  of  flexible 
elastic  rod,  simulating  the  stream  core,  is  rigidly  fastened,  and  other  end  has  possibility  of  the 
axial and - in limits of the clearance radial space - transversal pliability, taking into account the 
peculiarities of the starting hydrodynamic zone of fluid flow in pipe. We receive simplistically 
the equality of the stream core diameter to the pipe diameter because of small thickness of hy-
drodynamic  sublayer.  The  condition  of  transition  of  the  fluid  flow  in  pipe  to  turbulent  regime 
consists in equality of the total of the viscosity forces applied to the stream core from the pipe 
wall side, to Euler's critical force at which one the flexible rod loses the stability of the rectilinear 
shape of equilibrium under action of the own weight. 

The overall value of axial force corresponding to static head of the laminar flow of fluid in the 
straight pipe with the round cross-section is expressed by J.Poiseuille’s formula:

µ - coefficient of dynamic viscosity, kgf⋅s / m2; L – pipe length, m; V – average velocity deter-
minated by the flow rate in pipe, m/s. 

The  minimum  quantity  of  the  resultant  of  the  uniformly  distributed  along  length  compressing 
forces, applied to flexible rod, when this rod, having the rigidly fastened end, loses stability by 
Euler, is determined by expression: 

where E – modulus of elasticity, kgf/m2; J – moment of inertia of the flexible rod section, m4. 

Euler's stability condition has the appearance for rod with the round section: 

where ν - reduction coefficient of the length of flexible rod, dimensionless quantity. 

We obtain the criterial expression for determination of transition of stream in pipe from laminar 
to turbulent regime, equating forces NP and NE under condition of equality of the rod and stream 
diameters and realizing the elementary transformations:

Symbol Tr means the time of mechanical relaxation of fluid by dimensionality and quantity, and 
tr  is  the  time  of  passage  of  pipe  by  the  stream  particles  at  the  obtained  expression.  Thus,  the 
physical constant of fluid, the generalized geometrical parameter of pipe with allowance for re-
duction coefficient and the kinematic parameter of stream are introduced into correspondence at 
the obtained expression. 

The analysis of the obtained expressions (4, 5) shows that influence of length of the fluid stream 
in pipe on the stability of the form of its motion is much higher, than influence of length of flexi-
ble rod on its buckling. 

The turbulent regime cannot come into being under any increase of velocity in the sufficiently 
short pipe (nozzle), according to expression (4). Such property of this expression predetermines a 
presence of the initial zone of stream possessing an absolute stability similarly to the short rods, 
for which one the problem of stability is not actually. The obtained expression indicates also that 
the flow will be only laminar at diminution of pipe diameter to the size of capillary, because of 
the  dominant  action  of  the  adhesion-cohesion  forces  of  solid  surface  in  this  case.  Well-known 
phenomenon of the obliteration stopping the outflow of fluid in the course of time, is natural for 
such, even of short channels. The obtained criterion expression (4) can be reduced to the form 
suitable for gas stream and containing the Reynolds' number. It is enough to introduce the substi-

The obtained expression (6) is wider than expression for a Reynolds' number at the expense of 
the  more  complete  and  the  generalized  taking  into  account  of  the  form  of  pipe  by  the  non-
dimensional parameter, containing not only the diameter of pipe, but also its length with allow-
ance for the length reduction coefficient.  

Comparing the transition to the turbulence with buckling of the flexible rod located in pipe with 
the clearance space, it is necessary to note also difference between them. The stress in such rod is 
the total of the longitudinal compressing forces and curving forces at its buckling under action of 
the axial compressing force:

where P – axial force of compression, A – sectional area of the rod, E⋅J – flexural stiffness of the 
rod, ∆ - clearance space between the rod and the pipe, l – length of quarter of wave of the incur-
vated rod up to the point of contact with pipe at buckling [5], W – section modulus of the rod.  

This stressed state of the rod is reversible as the elastic buckling is considered.

The above-adduced expression (7) to certain extent is valid and for the fluid stream in pipe at the 
transition to the turbulent flow regime. The difference from behavior of a rod is, that the bending 
oscillations of the fluid flow core are bound not only with the arcuation of its trajectory of mo-
tion,  but  also  with  the  formation  of  vortices  at periodic  pushing  of  the  stream  core  against  the 
walls of the straight pipe. Both of these kinds of the diversion from rectilinear structure of the 
translational  motion  form  the  nonreversible  part  of  the  power  losses  in  turbulent  flow.  At  the 
same time the direct and reverse transition between the laminar and turbulent regime of a fluid 
stream in the straight pipe (so called ”intermittent turbulence”) is characterized by inequality of 
the pressure drops applied to the pipe flow system in accordance to the experiment results. This 
feature accompanies also the buckling and the unbending of flexible rod, located into tough pipe 
with gap and loaded by longitudinal forces of own weight [5]. 

The  features  of  loss  of  stability  of  the  laminar  flow  regime  in  pipe  under  action  of  frictional 
forces (as well as of flexible rod, under action of own weight) can be traced during viewing of 
the fluid flow in the light diverged and light converged mouthpieces (nozzles). 

Let us compare three flexible rods under action of own weight one: cylindrical and two conical 
by the elastic stability condition. We accept identical an average diameter and length of all three 
rods. We accept also identical the elastic modulus, density of material of rods and character of 
fastening of the bearing end. It is possible to think, that the weight of all three rods is practically 
identical  under  the  small  cone  angle,  in  other  words  the  total  force  (resultant)  of  the  action  of 
rods to its support is approximately identical. 

We are noting that the part of a cylindrical rod near the support is the most critical from a point 
of view of elastic stability. We are also noting, comparing the viewed rods, that the second rod 
has the little more section near the support as contrast to the first, and the third rod has the little 
less section near the support. It is not difficult to establish, taking into account that the ultimate 
load on Euler is proportional (with other things being equal) to the fourth degree of diameter for 
rods with the circular cross-section, that the small conicity of the simply supported rods under 
action of own weight leads to an essential odds in its stability. The similar phenomenons of the 
protracted laminar flow regime in the light converged mouthpieces and the early transition to the 
turbulent flow regime in the light diverged mouthpieces are well-known in experimental hydro-
mechanics.  In  this  connection  a  factor,  which  takes  into  account  quantity  and  character  of  the 
mouthpiece conicity, is necessary to introduce in the criterion expression (4). In result, the ex-
pression (4) will accept a view:

It is also known in experimental hydrodynamics, that the transition to the turbulent flow regime 
occurs much earlier in hoselines (for example, rubberized-fabric) than in the metal tough pipes. 
Reynolds' number can descend up to ~ 150 in hoselines. This feature is bound with the low bend-
ing stiffness of hoselines. The factor is necessary to introduce in the expression (4) in the form of 
ratio of bending stiffnesses of the viewed hoseline and tough pipe, which one was applied in ex-
periments of Nikuradse, Colebrook and White, Moody and other, for taking into account of this 
feature. Now the obtained criterion expression in the form (8) accept a view:

where EsJs, ErJr – bending stiffness of the hoselines and tough pipe accordingly, 1/m – degree of 
influence of relative flexibility of pipe on transition to the turbulence. 

Influence on system “stream-pipe” of the different factors and actions should and can be taken 
into account by a similar way in the obtained criterion expression (4):  

the laminarization devices and turbulator in pipe and at inlet to its, 

− 
−  damping of pipe, 
−  action of oscillations on the pipe, on the stream in it and on the outflowing jet [4, 6], 
relative increase of the gas stream velocity in the pipe with constant value of sectional area, 
− 
−  heat exchange of stream with the pipe wall (with allowance for the opposite change of vis-

cosity of liquid and gas under thermal action),  
−  acceleration of pipe under action of external forces, 
−  suction or injection of the additional mass flow rate and action of other factors, which one 

can exert the stabilizing or destabilizing influence on flow regime. 

Coefficient ν characterizes influence of an inlet profile on the calculated length of pipe and one 
can be within limits 0.715 ≤ ν ≤ 1.12. The smaller value will match to the smooth inlet into pipe, 
the greater value will match to the abrupt inlet into pipe. 

The presented analysis and development of physical model of transition of the laminar flow re-
gime to the turbulent in pipe allow to apply its to development of physical models of the men-
tioned transition for other forms of the internal flows. 

We shall consider the problem on the stability of laminar motion of stream in the flat channel in 
the qualitative aspect. The stream should be presented in the form of the flexible plate located 
with the backlash in the flat tough channel in this case. It is necessary to note the distinction of 
the buckling of rods from the buckling of plates from a position of the theory of the elastic static 
stability  of  plates.  This  distinction  is,  that  the  elastic  stability  of  the  one-piece  plate  under  the 
compression  load  appears  much  above,  than  the  elastic  stability  of  plate  composed  from  the 
separate rods. It means physically, that the total force of buckling of the rod gang, simulating the 
plate, is equal to the force of buckling of the one rod, multiplied to the quantity of rods. Such re-
sult  reflects  the  independence  of  the  transversal  deformation  of  each  rod  at  its  buckling.  The 
rods, constituting the one-piece plate, are bound among themselves and this connection restricts 
the freedom of their transversal deformation under action of the compressing forces. Therefore 
the  one-piece  plate  is  more  steady,  than  the  compounded.  Hydrodynamic  experiment  displays, 
that the stability of the laminar flow is much higher in the flat channel, than in the ordinary pipes 
[7].  The  replacement  of  static  rectilinear  structure  of  the  translational  motion  to  the  dynamical 
flexural-vortical structure of the translational motion of stream happens at the transition of flat 
flow to turbulent regime. The running bend waves of the stream core make the alternating zones 
of periodic pushing of its to the flat walls of the channel with formation of vortices and the sepa-
ration zones from wall. The tractive resistance of the stream is determined by roughness of walls 
of the flat channel in this case, as this takes place in pipes. 

The described approach allows to develop the physical model of loss of stability of laminar flow 
in the annular gap between two pipes as the elastic cylindrical shell in the rigid annular cavity 
under action of the axially applied own weight. The stability of such laminar flow appreciably 
depends on the size of the backlash between pipes enveloping a stream in this case. The stability 
of the laminar regime is rather higher and it approaches to stability of laminar flow in the flat 
channel in case of rather small backlash. The stability of laminar flow is reduced up to a level of 
pipe flowing in case of rather major backlash. It is necessary to take into account an external in-
fluence at quantitative estimation of the stability criterion of laminar flow in the flat channel and 
the annular intertubular backlash as it is shown on an example of pipe flowing.

Discussion of results 
 
The stability theory by Euler allows to establish, that the quantity of the ultimate load of flexible 
rod under action of own weight can vary in the ten times, depending on the conditions of fasten-
ing of rod. Results of well-known hydrodynamic experiments [7] also testifies, that the laminar 
regime can exist at tenfold increase of the stream  motion  velocity  as  contrast  to  value  of  Rey-
nolds' numbers 2320-4000. 

Alongside with it is necessary to take into account, that the action on rod of oscillations of the 
specified  direction  and  frequencies  can  also  rather  appreciably  change  the  quantity  of  the  ulti-
mate load, both in the direction of its increase, and in the direction of decrease. That is, the mul-
tiple-factor  dependence  of  stability  of  flexible  elastic  rod  in  static  conditions  is  obvious.  The 
fluid medium has appreciably more number of degrees of freedom of motion because of property 
of the permanent and continuous intrastructural mobility. The dynamics of fluid appreciably ex-
ceeds dynamics of a solid body by variety of combinations of a state and motion and by the mul-
tiple-factorness of the influencing actions, thanks to mentioned property. The fluid at motion in 
pipe has a linear elastics modulus similarly to solid body. This property appears at passage of the 
flat longitudinal waves of elastic compression-distension in the pipe stream of fluid. Simultane-
ously fluid has the modulus of the volume elasticity under action of static head. The pipe shapes 
the fluid stream in the form of lengthy rod. The interaction of stream with the pipe wall loads the 
fluid  rod  by  forces  of  longitudinal  compression  in  the  form  of  law  of  static  head  [8,  9]  that  is 
equivalent to action of own weight to the flexible rod. Thus, the fluid stream is moved by transla-
tional in pipe and simultaneously loses the rectilinear structure of laminar motion as the rectilin-
ear shape of an elastic static balance. The combination of motion of the fluid stream in pipe with 
loss of static stability stipulates appearance of new structure of motion. This structure consists of 
the running waves of the many times incurvated stream, which at such shape of interaction with 
wall of pipe generates on the one hand vortices, and on the other hand zones of flow separation 
from the pipe wall. Running waves of the flexure at pushing of stream under angle of attack on 
the pipe wall destroy the laminar hydrodynamic sublayer coating the roughness of pipe wall at 
the developed turbulence. Now tractive resistance of stream in pipe depends in the essential de-
gree  on  the  degree  of  roughness  of  the  pipe  wall  in  complete  correspondence  with  the  Niku-
radse’s  diagram.  As  to  the  multiple-factorness  of  influence  of  external  actions  on  transition  of 
laminar structure of stream to the turbulent, it is stipulated by multiplicity of motion and state of 
fluid, specially such thermomechanical active medium as the gas. 

The  problem  arises  in  connection  with  the  above-mentioned:  what  is  the  sense  of  Reynolds' 
numbers? 

The dimensionless ratio of the inertial forces and the viscosity forces of fluid stream disregarding 
of  any  other  factors  and  parameters  of  “stream-pipe”  system,  is  the  number  of  local  hydrody-
namic similarity. This number has no indications of the stability criterion of rectilinear structure 
of flowing.  

Elucidation  of  nature  of  turbulence  and  determination  of  its  origin  criterion  liberate  Reynolds’ 
number from unusual function to it and the same time not reduce in slightest degree the signifi-
cance of this hydrodynamic similarity number in the everything else well-known cases. 
 
Final remark 
 
The  methodology  of  approach  to  the  problems  of  loss  of  stability  of  the  laminar  flow  and  the 
structure of the turbulent flow in pipe and resolution of these stated above problems are an ex-
ample for the solution of similar problems of the internal flows and external streamlines of the 
different form which one will be enunciated in further publications of the authors.

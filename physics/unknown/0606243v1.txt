Summary 

Traveltime  tomography  is  a  very  effective  tool  to  reconstruct  acoustic,  seismic  or 
electromagnetic wave speed distribution. To infer the velocity image of the medium from the 
measurements of first arrivals is a typical example of ill-posed problem. In the framework of 
Tikhonov regularization theory, in order to replace an ill-posed problem by a well-posed one 
and  to  get  a  unique  and  stable  solution,  a  stabilizing  functional  (stabilizer)  has  to  be 
introduced. The stabilizer selects the desired solution from a class of solutions with a specific 
physical and/or geometrical property; e.g., the existence of sharp boundaries separating media 
with  different  petrophysical  parameters.  Usually  stabilizers  based  on  maximum  smoothness 
criteria  are  used  during  the  inversion  process;  in  these  cases  the  solutions  provide  smooth 
images which, in many situations, do not describe the examined objects properly. Recently a 
new  algorithm  of  direct  minimization  of  the  Tikhonov  parametric  functional  with  minimum 
support  stabilizer  has  been  introduced;  it  produces  clear  and  focused  images  of  targets  with 
sharp boundaries. In this research we apply this new technique to real radar tomographic data 
and  we  compare  the  obtained  result  with  the  solution  generated  by  the  more  traditional 
minimum norm stabilizer. 

Introduction 

Traveltime tomography is a very widely used technique: its uses go from mining exploration 
and  petroleum  reservoir  characterization  [1,  2]  to  non-destructive  evaluation  in  engineering 
[3,  4].  To  determine  velocity  distribution  from  measurements  of  traveltime  is  a  non-unique 
problem  and  its  numerical  solution  is  unstable:  small  variations  in  the  data  can  cause  large 
variations  in  the  solution.  Commonly  used  inversion  methods  provide  unique  and  stable 
solutions  by  introducing  the  appropriate  stabilizing  functional  (stabilizer).  The  main  aim  of 
the  stabilizer  is  to  incorporate  a  priori  knowledge  in  the  inversion  process.  Over  the  last 
decade several different stabilizers have been introduced [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. These new stabilizers 
permit  reconstruction  of  blocky  structures  with  abrupt  change  of  properties.  They  generate 
clearer  and  more  focused  images  of  the  anomalies  than  the  conventional  maximum 
smoothness  functionals.  For  example,  it  was  shown  that  the  minimum  support  (MS) 
functional can be very useful in the solution of different geophysical inverse problems [8, 10, 
11].  This  particular  functional  selects  the  desired  stable  solution  with  the  following 
characteristic: anomalies have sharp boundaries. The practical problem of focusing inversion 
with  the  MS  stabilizer  is  that  this  functional  is  not  quadratic,  which  complicates  the 
minimization  of  the  Tikhonov  parametric  functional.  This  difficulty  has  been  faced  using 
different approaches [8, 10, 12, 13, 14]. In this research we use a slightly different version of 
the algorithm developed by Zhdanov et al [11, 12, 14]; we show the result obtained applying 
this  novel  technique  to  real  radar  tomographic  traveltimes.  Moreover  we  compare  MS 
solution with the result generated by the more traditional minimum norm (MN) stabilizer.

There are several different choices for the stabilizer and of course different stabilizers produce 
different solutions. In this research, we analyze: 

the MN stabilizer ( MNs
and an appropriate a priori model

the  MS  stabilizer  ( MSs

As  a  result,  we  obtain a uniform sensitivity of the traveltimes to different model parameters 
[10]. If we take into account that  ∑i
ijA is the total distance that all rays travel in the cell j-th, 
it is clear that these weights make all cells equally “important” and it doesn’t matter if a cell is 
crossed by many or few rays. If we do not use any weighting matrix, data are more sensitive 
to the velocity value of those cells crossed by many rays.

Radar traveltimes inversion 

We compare inversion results obtained using the two stabilizers discussed overleaf. Data were 
radar first arrivals collected over a brick wall with two cavities, whose position and dimension 
(11  cm  x  14.4  cm)  were  known.  The  antenna  frequency  was  1.6  GHz.  The  receiver  was 
located  on  one  side  of  the  wall  in  49  positions  spaced  2.5  cm  apart.  For  every  receiving 
antenna  position  the  transmitter  was  moved  through  49  positions  along  a  vertical  profile  on 
the  other  side  of  the  wall;  thus  the  available  traveltimes  were  ~49x49=2401.  The  antenna 
positions  were  monitored  by  a  new  prototype  for  automatic  positioning.  An  interactive 
program  for  semiautomatic  picking,  developed  at  the  Politecnico  di  Milano,  was  used  to 
extract the traveltimes. 

We choose to terminate the minimization process of 
reached, assuming that the noise level in the observed data is 3.5%.

Figure 1a shows MN result: it has the typical relatively smooth model parameter distribution, 
the  image  is  diffused  and  unfocused,  the  position  of  the  two  cavities  (indicated  by  the  two 
white frames) is not correctly detected. 

In  the  MS  solution  (figure  1b),  cavity  positions  are  quite  well  determined.  Blurring  effects, 
very  common  in  this  kind  of  tomography,  are  almost  absent.  Dimensions  are  lightly 
underestimated: in the case of the void on the right, probably because of the low ray coverage 
in  that  area.  Moreover,  in  general,  we  should  take  into  account  that  the  velocity  within  the 
cavities  is  twice  the  background  velocity,  thus  the  actual  slowness  is  not  really  a  small 
perturbation of the background as we assume. 

Stabilization  of  inversion  methods  with  smoothing  functionals  can  result  in  oversmoothed 
reconstruction of object properties. We suggest the use of the  MNs
 to preserve sharp features 
in inverted models. The example shows that this approach can recover sharp contrast velocity 
distributions  when  prior  information  about  the  anomalies  is  available.  A  more  sophisticated 
way  to  insure  that  model  parameters  belong  to  some  interval  (e.g.  introducing  a  logaritmic 
parametrization) and  to include a ray-tracing tool would make the result even better.

Abstract

Systematic Raman experiments performed on water and water-ethanol samples, stored in

different containers (fused silica, polypropylene, soda-lime glass type III) for several hours, have

shown that the luminescence contribution to the Raman signal fluctuations is directly related to

the  container  composition.  Intensity  fluctuations  as  large  as  98%,  have  been  observed  in  the

spectral  regions  corresponding  to  the  both  water  intramolecular  and  intermolecular  vibrations,

despite  the  fact  that  the  wavenumbers  of  the  modes  remained  unchanged.  We  undoubtedly

attribute these fluctuations to a luminescence phenomenon on the basis of : i) the absence of such

effect in the anti-Stokes domain, ii) its dependence on the excitation laser wavelength, iii) other

relevant  photoluminescence  experiments.  This  luminescence  is  attributed  to  pollutants  at  ultra-

low concentration coming from the different containers.

Keywords : Water, Raman spectroscopy, Luminescence, content-container interaction.

1. Introduction

Our aim is to give an additional contribution to the question of "intrinsic luminescence"

of water already addressed by Lobyshev et al. [1, 2]. Independently of a possible interpretation in

terms  of  intrinsic  luminescence,  few  authors  [3,  4]  have  published  results  pointing  out  the

luminescence  effects  in  water.  Most  of  these  effects  were  finally  attributed  to  the  role  of

admixtures. Moreover, it is well known that luminescence and Raman spectroscopy performed

on  liquids,  gases  or  solids,  are  highly  sensitive  to  traces  of  pollutants,  even  at  ultra-low

concentrations. These techniques are already used for the detection of pollutants in water.

The objective of the present work is to bring a contribution in analysing tiny and subtle

effects  of  electromagnetic  waves  on  water.  Raman  scattering  can  be  considered  as  a  relevant

technique for studying these effects which are supposed to act on the intensity of the scattering

intensity and not on the wavenumber of the characteristic bands of water molecule vibrations. It

should be recalled that those working on aqueous solutions often calibrate their  experiment on

the  Raman  bands  of  water.  We  therefore  focused  our  attention  on  the  reproducibility  of  the

intensity  of  water  Raman  bands.  At  this  step,  we  observed  large  variations  of  the  Raman

response that we had to correlate with some basic phenomena and our experimental process.

The  first  aim  of  the  present  report  is  to  demonstrate  the  occurrence  of  luminescence

phenomena due to pollutants coming from the tubes containing the water samples used generally

for experiments. The second aim is to question the interpretation of Lobyshev's experiments in

terms of intrinsic luminescence of water.

After the presentation of the characterisation techniques used for our experiments (section

2),  we  describe  and  discuss  in  section  3  our  results  obtained  from  pure  water  and  on  water-

ethanol samples.

Liquids for samples

content.

Containers

In order to achieve our first aim (see above, Introduction), we used two kinds of liquid

samples:  pure  water  and  hydro-alcoholic  solution.  Adding  ethanol  to  water  increases  the

apolarity of the liquid and therefore enhances the solubilization of organic components possibly

present in the wall of the container. Raman experiments were completed with photoluminescence

experiments  at  a  different  excitation  wavelength  and  the  conductivity  of  the  samples  has  been

measured at different steps of the experiment. All data were recorded at room temperature (20-

-  pure  water  :  SEROMED  produced  by  Biochrom  KG,  apyrogen,  conductivity  between

0,06  and 0,08 µS cm-1 directly after the production and stored in bottles  of  borosilicate

glass  type  I,  passivisated  in  order  to  reduce  the  migration  of  its  components  in  the

- hydro-alcoholic solution: 50% ethanol Chromanorm Merck and 50% SEROMED water

Liquids were stored during twelve hours in three different kinds of containers :

•  Soda-lime glass type III disposable operculated tubes (Prolabo)

•  Polypropylene disposable operculated tubes (Polylabo)

•  Quartz glass Suprasil cells (Heraeus)

4

For  the  optical  experiments  (Raman  scattering  and  photoluminescence),  liquids  were

transferred in Quartz Suprasil cells of 3,5 ml inner volume (Hellma)

Raman scattering experiment

Raman  scattering  was  excited  with  an  Argon  laser  (Stabilite,  Spectra  Physics,

λ=514.5nm, power level of 100 mW focused with a 100µm diameter beam in the middle of the

cell)  and  collected,  in  90°  configuration,  on  a  Jobin-Yvon  U1000  spectrometer  double

monochromator  equipped  with  a  photomultiplier  counter  cooled  by  a  Peltier  cell  .  Stokes  and

anti-Stokes  spectra  were  recorded  between  –500  and  +500  cm-1  in  order  to  distinguish  Raman

lines  from  luminescence.  The  total  range  of  measurement  was  –500  to  +4000  cm-1.  At  low

frequency, all spectra were reduced by the Bose-Einstein factor [5, 6]. The power incident on the

sample was measured before and after each scan.

Photoluminescence experiment

The  photonic  excitation  was  realized  at  488  nm  with  an  Argon  laser  (Coherent,  Innova

300, 100 mW). Light emitted from the sample was collected, in 90° configuration, by an optical

fiber located at 10 mm of the cell and analyzed by a Jobin-Yvon Spectrometer HR 460 equipped

with a multichannel CCD detector (Spectraview-2D,  2000  pixels).  The  resolution  is  4nm/point

with a 300 µm slit.

Conductivity measurements

Conductivity  measurements  were  realized  using  a  Multi-meter  Consort  C835,  with  an

electrode of cell constant K=0,1 cm-1, especially adapted for low ionic concentration solutions,

with automatic temperature correction (Pt1000).

3. Results and discussion

We  recall  that  with  the  aim  of  demonstrating  the  influence  of  incidental  pollutants  on

water samples, we decided to use pure water samples and 50% water – 50% ethanol sample;. the

latter samples showing a higher capability for organic compound dissolution.

a) pure water samples

We first present the results obtained with samples of pure SEROMED water (see above,

section 2) stored in three different kinds of tubes : quartz glass (QW), polypropylene (PW) and

soda-lime  glass  type  III  (GW).  Three  kinds  of  experimental  results  are  compared  :  Raman

scattering, photoluminescence and conductivity measurements.

Figures 1, 2 and 3 show the Raman spectra of these three samples excited at 514.5 nm,

whereas  Table  1  gives  the  increase  (in  relative  value)  of  the  Raman  intensity  of  PW  and  GW

samples  compared  to  that  of  QW  sample  considered  as  a  reference,  at  discrete  frequencies,

characteristic of the intramolecular and intermolecular vibrations of the water molecules.

The  Raman  spectrum  of  GW  samples  clearly  shows  a  large  intensity  excess  over  those

from  QW  and  PW  spectra,  especially  in  the  middle  (Figure  2)  and  high  (Figure  1)  frequency

ranges  of  the  Stokes  domain.  This  excess  can  be  as  large  as  98%  at  ca.  2110  cm-1  (Table  1).

Then  this  excess  decreases  slowly  both  in  the  middle  and  high  frequency  ranges  (respectively

60% at 1640 cm-1 and 23 % at 3240 cm-1). At lower frequencies and in the anti-Stokes domain

(Figure  3),  this  difference  never  exceeds  16%.  Considering  this  small  excess  value  at  low

frequency  region  and  the  fact  that  it  is  not  observed  in  a  symmetric  manner  in  the  Stokes  and

6

anti-Stokes  domains  (see  Table  1:  14%  at  –470  cm-1  and  28%  at  +470  cm-1)  we  assign  this

observation to the photoluminescence effect.

With  this  hypothesis,  we  performed  photoluminescence  experiments  on  the  two  most

characteristic  samples  (GW  and  QW).  We  excited  this  luminescence  at  488  nm  (instead  of

514.5) in order to demonstrate the dependence of this effect with the energy of excitation. And

effectively,  the  luminescence  response  of  GW  sample  excited  at  488  nm  is  extremely  high

around 2000 cm-1; it reaches 4.5 times the QW response at 2110 cm-1 (544nm), instead of 98% at

2110  cm-1  (577nm)  when  excited  at  514.5  nm  (see  Figure  4  and  Table  1).  This  strong

photoluminescence effect, absent (or very weak) in the QW sample, can only be attributed to the

luminescence of pollutants. In order to verify this assumption, we measured the conductivity of

our samples (see table 2). The conductivity of GW samples is effectively four times larger than

that of QW and PW samples, whereas their pH is roughly the same: 6.8.

Therefore, one can conclude that pollutants, in very tiny concentration, coming probably

from  the  walls  of  the  tubes  (all  manipulated  in  the  same  conditions)  are  responsible  for  the

photoluminescence  signal  disturbing  the  intrinsic  Raman  scattering  spectrum  of  water.  This

signal  is  evidently  frequency  dependent  and  is  particularly  high  when  excited  at  488  nm.  The

main  contribution  of  this  photoluminescence  is  in  the  intramolecular  vibration  domain  of  the

Raman  spectrum  of  water.  Its  maximum  occurs  at  ca.  2110  cm-1,  frequency  associated  to  the

additive  combination  of  the  of  the  water  molecule  bending  mode  (ca.  1640  cm-1)  and  of  an

intermolecular mode (ca. 470 cm-1), [6].

b) Water-ethanol samples

The same experiments were performed on 50% water – 50% ethanol samples in order to

enhance  the  apolarity  of  the  liquid  and  point  out  the  possible  differences  of  behaviour  in  the

different kinds of containers.

7

Figure 5 presents the Raman spectra of the three samples : 50% water – 50% ethanol in :

quartz glass (QWE), polypropylene (PWE) and soda-lime glass type III (GWE). The spectrum of

pure  SEROMED  water  in  quartz  glass  (QW)  has  been  added  for  comparison.  As  compared  to

Figure 1 (and to curve QW), a lot of new bands show up in curves QWE, PWE and GWE, in the

frequency  range  300-3000  cm-1,  characteristic  of  the  vibrations  of  the  ethanol  molecule.  The

background  envelope of the  ethanol  vibration modes clearly departs  from the base response of

pure water (curve QW) and can be attributed to photoluminescence of specific impurities present

in ethanol and of pollutants coming from the tubes and specifically solubilized by ethanol. It is

obvious,  by  comparing  the  responses  of  samples  QWE  and  QW,  of  respectively  water-ethanol

and  pure  water  in  tubes  of  the  same  composition  (quartz  glass).  This  extra  luminescence

contribution to the Raman spectrum is important when excited at 514.5 nm and extends from 400

to  2700  cm-1,  with  a  maximum  around  1360  cm-1  (553  nm).  An  other  evidence  of  the

luminescent character of this contribution can be given by varying the laser power of the Raman

excitation.  By  decreasing  power  from  100  to  50  mW,  one  can  observe  total  vanishing  of  this

contribution  (see  Figure  7    in  the  case  of  soda-lime  glass  container),  while  the  Raman  modes

remain unchanged.

When excited at 488 nm in a photoluminescence experiment (see figure 6), the maximum

of the photoluminescence spectrum now occurs around 2100-2500 cm-1 (543-556 nm), like in the

previous  experiment  with  pure  SEROMED  water  (see  figure  4),  while  the  extra  contribution

previously  pointed  out  with  a  maximum  at  ca.  1360  cm-1  is  considerably  weakened,  but  still

present  (see  Figure  6  and  Table  1).  The  frequency  dependence  of  these  features  supports  their

interpretation in terms of photoluminescence effects.

Moreover, conductivity measurements performed on QWE, PWE and GWE samples (see

Table 2), qualitatively confirm these interpretations. The basic conductivity of QWE and PWE

8

samples are equal and roughly two times those corresponding to QW and PW samples. It is due

to  a  sum  of  the  intrinsic  conductivity  of  the  water-ethanol  solution,  and  to  the  ionic  impurity

conductivity of ethanol. These impurities contribute to the main broad photoluminescence band

pointed  out  above. On the other hand, the GWE conductivity is  smaller  than  the  GW  one  (4.6

compared to 6.7 µScm-1). The GWE conductivity results from two contributions: the previously

mentioned  ionic  impurity  conductivity  of  ethanol  plus  the  pollutant  conductivity  coming  from

dissolving of soda-lime glass components in the water-ethanol solution. The second contribution

can be weaker in GWE samples than in GW ones due to weaker dissolution of soda-lime glass

components  in  the  water-ethanol  solution  than  in  pure  water.  This  explanation  is  supported  by

the  weaker  photoluminescence  ratio  of  these  pollutants  observed  at  2110  cm-1  (0.44  instead  of

4.48, see Table 2).

c) Complementary remarks

•  Raman  scattering  and  photoluminescence  spectra  presented  above  were  reproduced  on  a

significant number of samples prepared in the same conditions.

•  Conductivity  values  presented 

in  Table  2  result  from  averaging  on  conductivity

measurements performed on these different samples.

•  Moreover,  photoluminescence  spectra  of  samples  prepared  with  demineralized  water  of

lower conductivity than SEROMED water (0.5 µScm-1 instead of 1.6 µScm-1), were identical

to those prepared with SEROMED water (Figure 4) for both quartz glass and soda-lime glass

containers. This result confirms, (i) that it is really the luminescence of the components of the

container  which  is  observed,  (ii)  that  dissolving  of  these  components  is  the  same  by

demineralized water as by SEROMED water.

4. Conclusions

By the joint use of Raman scattering, photoluminescence and conductivity experiments,

we  have  shown  that  the  study  of  the  optical  properties  of  high  purity  water  samples  can  be

strongly perturbed by the photoluminescence of traces of pollutants coming from the container.

Classical soda-lime glass type III tubes are clearly the worse containers. Pure water (SEROMED

or demineralized) stored in polypropylene tubes exhibits very weak photoluminescence, slightly

higher  than  that  in  quartz  glass  tubes.  On  the  other  hand,  alcoholic  solutions  stored  in

polypropylene  tubes  exhibit  a  much  higher  photoluminescence  than  in  quartz  glass  tubes.

Moreover polypropylene due to its composition may release organic components. In conclusion,

quartz glass is clearly the most suitable container material for experiments involving high purity

water as it minimizes content-container interactions.

Other  characterisations  like  Inductively  Coupled  Plasma  Mass  Spectrometry  (ICP-MS)

are envisaged in order to identify the pollutants which induce the photoluminescence observed in

our  experiments.  We  also  plan  to  perform  photoluminescence  excitation  spectra  for  a  better

characterization of the pollutant luminescence.

At  this  step  of  our  experiments,  in  the  absence  of  the  complementary  characterizations

mentioned above, it seems difficult to definitely conclude on a possible intrinsic luminescence of

water,  already  experimentally  demonstrated  by  Lobyshev  et  al  [1,  2].  Nevertheless,  for  the

moment,  we  have  demonstrated  the  difficulty  to  obtain  water  samples  totally  free  of  any

pollutants capable to produce tiny noisy photoluminescence effects.

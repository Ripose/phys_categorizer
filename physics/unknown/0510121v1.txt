Abstract

In this paper, the dynamic behaviour of an oscillating tip–microlever system at the proximity of a surface is discussed.
The attractive tip–surface interaction is simply described with a Van der Waals dispersive term and a sphere–plane
geometry. We show that the non linear behaviour of the oscillator is able to explain the observed shifts of the resonance
frequency as a function of the tip–surface distance without the need of introducing a particular short range force. q

1. Introduction

w

Few years ago, the resonant non contact mode has
been found as a way to map tip–surface interaction
as shifts of the resonance frequency 1,2 . Since then,
numerous technical and experimental efforts had been
performed showing that measurements of shifts were
x
able to produce images at the atomic scale 3–6 .
The ‘routinely’ achievement of the atomic resolution
by several different teams and on different types of
surface were thought as a real breakthrough in the

field of the scanning probe microscopy. Moreover,
the increase of experiments using the resonant non
contact mode with a high vibrating amplitude and
(cid:14)
the systematic use of the intermittent contact

called tapping mode produced numerous stimulating

results 7–9 . Therefore,
works dedicated to a non linear analysis of the
oscillating behaviour in an attractive and repulsive
x
field were greatly stimulated 10–16 .

Before going a step further, it is worth to discuss
general ideas at a qualitative level. Leaving aside the
the use of a high amplitude
technical point
reduces the influence of the fluctuations in frequency
w x2 , a first, counter intuitive, result is the use of a
large vibrating amplitude allowing the atomic resolu-rr q

that

tion to be achieved. The most common and shared
idea is that
to probe an attractive field with an
oscillator requires to use a small amplitude in order
to keep the force field nearly constant throughout the
vibrating amplitude. This comes from the idea that
shifts in resonance frequency were uniquely due to
the gradient force variations.

An image with the atomic resolution based on a
repulsive interaction appears quite easily understand-
able, but getting the same resolution when the attrac-
tive Van der Waals forces are involved is much
puzzling. The smooth variation of the Van der Waals
atom–atom interaction and the finite size of the
interacting objects requires a further summation,
leading to a tip–sample interaction smoothly varying
as a function of the tip–sample distance. For in-
stance, the sphere–plane interaction leads to an at-
tractive force with a dy2 power law. The force
gradient variations, with a power law dy3, should
the
normally not be able to produce features at
sub-atomic scale. This can be straightforwardly de-
duced within the framework of a linear analysis from
which shifts of the resonance frequency as a function
of the force gradient is unable to predict the ob-
served shape of the frequency changes as a function
.
(cid:14)
of the tip sample distance see below .
The key point with an AFM is that the recorded
information comes from the tip–sample interaction,
thus the tip is the collector but that which is mea-
sured is the cantilever response. In other words,
when the microlever is externally periodically ex-
cited, the recorded image is a measure of the oscillat-
ing behaviour of the tip–microlever system, which in
turn can be very sensitive to change of the strength
of the surrounding field either attractive or repulsive.
As a consequence, one can expect to find the
experimental conditions for which a small change of
the strength of the interacting field induces a spec-
tacular change of the oscillating properties. Such a
situation occurs if a non linear dynamic behaviour is
observed, such that the oscillator acts as an amplifi-
cation of a small perturbation. That means that those
variations will be able to produce a high contrast on
an image even for a small variation of the surface
properties.

When the tip–microlever system experiences a
purely attractive field, the oscillator exhibits a non
linear behaviour 10–12,14 . When the oscillator is

w

x

set at a drive frequency slightly below the resonance
one, a bifurcation from a monostable to a bistable
state occurs as soon as the vibrating amplitude is
large enough 14 . Such an instability makes the
tip–cantilever system very sensitive to any slight
change of the tip sample interaction. Indeed,
the
occurrence of an instability gives an infinite sensitiv-
ity with the undesirable effect that the tip can snap
the surface. Keeping the amplitude constant,
the
shifts in resonance frequency show a continuous,
monotonous, variation as a function of the tip–surface
distance which can be very large when non linear
effects take place, and in turn amplifies small changes
of the strength of the interaction.

This is the aim of the present work to show that
taking into account the non linear behaviour of an
oscillator and a Van der Waals like interaction be-
tween the tip and the surface could be enough to
describe most of the results obtained at the atomic
scale. As soon as a high amplitude is used, a non
linear behaviour is expected, the larger the ampli-
tude, the sharper is the bifurcation, or more pro-
nounced is the dependence of the shift in frequency
as a function of the tip–surface distance. As a conse-
quence, to explain the recorded images a complete
understanding of the oscillating behaviour is neces-
sary whenever possible. The paper is organised as
follows, in the first part we present the differential
equation aiming to describe the resonance behaviour
of a non linear oscillator, to do so we discuss the
Duffing oscillator that exhibits the main features
expected. Then we turn on a more general treatment
based on a variational principle from which we do
get an exact analytical expression of the harmonic
solution. This harmonic solution is discussed and
simplified in order to better compare the shift of the
resonance frequency as a function of the tip–surface
distance given by the linear and the non linear
analysis.

the harmonic ansazt

Most of what is given below, can be found in Ref.

ideas and underline the most interesting results. The

f and v are the external drive force

and the drive frequency, respectively. When the tip
is far from the surface, the resonance curves are

described in Eq. 1 .

To take into account a possible non linear be-
haviour of the oscillator, particularly when attractive
or repulsive interaction occur, the Duffing oscillator
is a pedagogical and suitable model:

Eq. 10 means that the relative width of the reso-
nance curve is smaller than that of the relative shift
of the resonance frequency. Assuming this condition
is fulfilled, when the amplitude is kept constant, Eq.
(cid:14) .9 allows a simple relation between the relative shift
and the tip–surface distance to be derived. Setting
a s 1 one gets from Eq. 9 :

Eq. 11 indicates that as soon as condition 10 is
fulfilled, the quality factor will not have any influ-
ence on the experimental results. In other words, the
thinness of the resonance peak does allow a small
frequency shift to be recorded, but you might also
expect
to have the same behaviour even with a
smaller quality factor.

To check the validity of the approach, a simula-

done with the Matlab simulink toolbox. The basis is
no more but the one suggested in the Albrecht paper

needed to measure the frequency shift are simulated.
The beginning of the oscillation is provided by a
noise generator b t . The open loop gain is higher

than unity,
thus an automatic gain control G u
provides a constant excitation u t s Bcos vt . An
example of numerical results is reported and com-
pared to the theoretical prediction. The agreement is
excellent, the input experimental parameter was the
dimensionless parameter as 0.00174 and the re-
fined value obtained from the equation derived from
Eq. 9 gives as 0.0017, note also that using the
approximate expression given by Eq. 11 , satisfacto-
rily describes the overall behaviour with as 0.0016

5. Conclusion

The present work aims to describe some of the
evolution of the vibrating tip–microlever system.
Here we focus essentially on shifts of the resonance
frequency that have been shown to be able to record
images with the atomic resolution. The theoretical
description is able to predict, with a good agreement,
the variation of the resonance frequency as a func-
tion of the tip–surface distance. It also shows that a
linear analysis cannot account for the frequency shift
evolution, thus, will be unable to explain large fre-
quency shift when the tip–sample distance is slightly
varied. Nevertheless, it remains to transpose this type
of work to explain the atomic contrast observed.
When a tip is scanned over a surface within the
(cid:14)
.X,Y plane, the experiment is different than that
recording oscillator properties at a fixed location in
the surface and moving up and down along the
vertical z axis. As the tip has a finite size and does
interact with a more or less extended part of the
surface, work has to be performed to explain how
small topographic corrugation could be equivalent to
what is observed by approaching the surface at a
fixed location.

In conclusion, the present paper shows that there
is no need to introduce particular short range forces

to explain the way the shifts of the resonance fre-
quency is varying as a function of the tip–sample
distance.

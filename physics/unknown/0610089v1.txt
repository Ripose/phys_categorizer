Abstract 
Buchanan et al. [Nature 436, p. 475 (2005)] have shown that it is possible to recognize paper samples 
via  their  speckle  pattern  by  using  a  line-shaped  laser  focus,  four  photo  detectors  and  a  scanning 
mechanism. In this report recognition of five out of ten paper samples is presented. The sample was 
illuminated by a 2.62 ± 0.02 mm circular spot and the reflected light was measured by a static CCD.  

We have formulated a criterion for recognition that limits the probability of false recognition 
to  0.1  %  for  the  experiment  with  ten  samples.  We  obtained  results  that  show  that  the  probability  of 
false recognition will be negligible for a large amount of samples. 

The  properties  of  speckle  originating  from  a  line  and  a  spot  illumination  source  have  been 
compared to see whether the use of a line results in major advantages for the recognition of samples. 
For  this  comparison  a  line  (69  ±  1  µm  width  and  1.93  ±  0.01  mm  length)  and  a  spot  (365  ±  5  µm 
diameter) were used.  In all correlations this line shows a stronger correlation peak than the spot when 
the size of the peak is measured relative to the standard deviation of the correlation.  

Preface 
The  experiment  described  in  this  report  was  performed  during  a  course  at  the  Complex  Photonic 
Systems group of Willem Vos and Ad Lagendijk at the University of Twente. To gain experience in 
performing  research  the  group  gave  us  the  opportunity  to  work  in  their  laboratory.  Inspired  by  an 
article of Buchanan et al. we have chosen the subject ‘recognizing samples via their speckle pattern’. 
We experienced the given opportunities in the lab and the freedom of choosing our own assignment as 
very challenging and motivating, for this we would like to thank the coordinator of the course, Allard 
Mosk. 

In  our  every  day  work  we  enjoyed  being  part  of  the  group.  We  have  attended  the  group 
meetings which gave us an impression of the research performed in the group. These meetings were 
also used to present our results; which taught us how to present results in a better way.  

Within  the  group  our  two  fellow  students  Ramy  El-Dardiry  and  Sanli  Faez  were  of  great 
importance for the atmosphere in which we worked. Both students are very motivated in their work 
and they had many good ideas, this inspired us in our project. 

Karen van der Molen and Cock Harteveld have guided us on a daily basis. Cock was always 
available for practical or technical questions. Besides this, he often took a glance at our setup and gave 
us many good suggestions on improving it.  Karen has always been interested in the progress of our 
work.  We  experienced  her  critical  attitude  as  very  motivating.  Furthermore  she  showed  us  how 
everyday scientific work goes. In the ups and downs of the research her support was very welcome. 

 
Thank you all, it was a great pleasure, 
 
 

Elbert and Frerik

1   Introduction 
In  our  world  forgery  is  timeless;  ever  since  money  and  important  documents  exist  falsifications  are 
made.  Many efforts have been done to distinguish these falsifications from real items. Buchanan et al. 
[1]  have  shown  that  paper  samples  can  be  distinguished  by  their  unique  internal  structure.  This 
structure  can  be  visualized  by  illuminating  the  paper  sample,  this  yields  a  unique  speckle  pattern 
which can be measured and stored. When these measurements are compared to other measurements, 
samples can be distinguished. Reproducibility of the speckle pattern is an important issue when using 
the pattern to distinguish samples. A speckle pattern is reproducible when the random structure of the 
paper does not change in time. Furthermore it is important that the speckle pattern can be measured in 
a reproducible way.  

Buchanan  et  al.  have  distinguished  500  paper  samples  by  their  speckle  pattern.  The 
recognition  is  even  possible  after  several  ways  of  rough  handling,  such  as  baking  it  in  an  oven, 
soaking  and  heavily  screwing  the  sample.  Buchanan  et  al.  measured  the  speckle  pattern  of  the 
reflected  light  with  a  scanning  mechanism,  a  laser  line  and  four  photo  detectors.  The  experiments 
described in this report omit the scanning mechanism and the photodiodes. One static Charge Coupled 
Device (CCD) was used to measure the speckle pattern of the reflected light. A large circular spot was 
used to create a speckle pattern for the recognition attempt presented in this report. Measurements to 
find advantages of using a line instead of a spot were performed too.  

In  this  report  we  first  describe  the  theoretical  aspects  of  our  experiments:  In  chapter  2  an 
estimation of the speckle size, Gaussian beam theory, an analysis of the properties of speckle and the 
used recognition criterion are presented. A discussion of the used recognition criterion we concludes 
the  chapter.  In  the  third  chapter  the  setup  on  which  all  measurements  were  performed  will  be 
presented.    The  chapter  ‘Results’  will  present  all  final  results,  and  discusses  the  performed 
measurements.  Plots  on  sample  movements,  distance  variations  and  the  angular  sensitivity  are 
presented.  From  these  measurements  we  will  conclude  that  the  use  of  a  line  has  no  significant 
advantages for the recognition of samples. A presentation of the recognition of the samples concludes 
this chapter. In the last two chapters the conclusions and recommendations will be given.

2  Theory 
This chapter deals with a few concepts that are used throughout the report. In section 2.1 the origin of 
speckles is discussed together with an estimation of the average size of speckles. Section 2.2 discusses 
Gaussian beam optics which is necessary for creating a spot and a line of a certain size. In section 2.3 
the  behavior  of  the  speckles  is  discussed  when  a  degree  of  freedom  is  changed.  We  conclude  the 
chapter with a description of our recognition criterion. 

2.1  Speckles 
When highly coherent light falls onto an object and the scattered light is projected onto a screen, the 
screen  is  speckled  with  bright  and  dark  regions.  These  speckles  are  caused  by  rays  scattering  from 
different parts of the illuminated area.  At the screen these rays have a different optical path length; 
therefore the rays interfere and result in speckles, as shown in Figure 2.1. In transmission speckles will 
be found too, in this case the phase shift between the rays arises from several scattering events within 
the sample.  
 

Figure 2.1: Rays reflect from different parts of the surface. The surface is optically 
rough thus the rays have a different optical path length at the observation point and 
interference will give bright and dark regions, so-called speckles. 

 

The relation between the illuminated part of the sample and the average size s  of the resulting 

speckles can be estimated by  
 

s »

l
D

, 

 

 
where ? is the wavelength of the laser beam, L the distance from the sample to the screen and D the 
length of the illuminated part of the sample. In Appendix A the derivation of this order-of-magnitude 
estimation for the speckle size is given. Equation (2.1) shows that when a larger area is illuminated the 
resulting speckles will shrink. The equation also shows that a sample lit by a horizontally aligned laser 
line will have a speckle pattern consisting of vertically aligned lines.  

Increasing the power of the light source increases the spread in intensity of the speckles since 

the highest measured intensity increases while the minimum remains zero.  

2.2  Gaussian beam optics 
The electromagnetic field modes inside most optical laser cavities can be described mathematically by 
TEMmn (Transverse Electric and Magnetic) modes, where m and n represent the order of the modes 
perpendicular to the propagation direction. The fundamental mode (m=n=0) has a Gaussian intensity 
profile. The HeNe laser that will be used is considered to be an ideal TEM00 mode [3, 4]; therefore 
Gaussian beam optics will be discussed now.

Due  to  the  fact  that  no  real  laser  beam  can  be  infinite  in  size,  diffraction  causes  beams  to 
spread  transversely  as  they  propagate.  The  radius  of  a  Gaussian  beam  w,  defined  as  the  distance  at 
which the intensity drops to e-2 times the maximal axial value, spreads in accordance to

0w  is  the  minimal  radius  of  the  beam,  the  so-called  beam  waist,  which  is  depicted  in  Figure 

Figure 2.2: Growth in beam diameter as a function of distance from the beam waist. 

 
A practical measure for the divergence is the distance  Rz  with respect to the focus. At  Rz  the cross-
0w one can 
sectional area of the beam is doubled. Using equation (2.2) and setting w(z) equal to v2·
solve this for  Rz :

The distance  Rz  is widely known as the Rayleigh range and  Rz  can be considered as a measure for 
the distance at which the beam waist remains rather constant, and in focus. 

2.3  Analyses of changes in the speckle pattern  

Recognizing  a  sample  using  the  speckle  pattern  of  two  different  measurements  requires  that 
the sample is mounted at the same place with certain accuracy. In this section an analysis is given of 
the changes in the speckle pattern caused by changing a degree of freedom in the setup. The sideward 
(x),  displacement  of  the  sample,  the  distance  between  sample  and  CCD  (r)  and  the  angular 
displacement (?) of the CCD are varied, see Figure 2.3.

incoming light and the CCD: x, r and ?. 

 

2.3.1  Displacement in x-direction 
When the sample is slightly shifted in x-direction the illuminated part of the sample is changed but the 
speckle  patterns  before  and  after  movement  will  be  correlated.  The  expect  that  the  correlation  is 
caused  by  the  area  O  that  is  enlightened  in  both  cases,  as  depicted  in  Figure  2.4  on  the  next  page, 
because the number of rays which have the same phase in both measurements is proportional to O. 

The  area  O  will  now  be  calculated  as  a  function  of  the  displacement 

dx .  The  spot  is 

parameterized as an ellipsoid:

(2.6) 

 
where 2·a is the short axis and 2·b the long axis of the spot. If the second ellipsoid is moved a distance 
dx , as one can seen in Figure 2.4, the area O can be calculated by integrating 2·y(x)·dx from 
dx /2 to a 
and  multiply this by 2:

2·b. The red surface is equal to the blue surface. To calculate the overlap between 
the two ellipsoids one can integrate only the blue surface and multiply this by 2. 

2.3.2  Variation in r-direction 
Changing  the  distance  between  the  sample  and  the  screen  will  modify  the  speckle  pattern  on  the 
screen. Two effects occur, first the path lengths of the rays change and second the speckles change in 
size according to formula 2.1.  

The effect of the change in the path lengths is considered by estimating the distance dr one can 
1D  the  waves 
move  the  sample  without  changing  the  speckle  pattern,  see  also  Figure  2.5.  At  point 
from point P interfere constructively with the waves from O and the waves from P’
 with those from O’, 
etc. When the screen is moved from r to r + dr one can estimate the change in path length difference

Figure  2.5:  A  schematic  representation  for  an  order  of  magnitude  estimation  of  the 
distance  one  can  move  the  screen  such  that  the  speckle  patterns  are  no  longer 
correlated.  

 
The  effect  of  the  magnification  of  speckles  is  illustrated  in  Figure  2.6.  Due  to  the  large 
magnification of the pattern the correlation reduces. From (2.1) it is shown that speckles, and therefore 
the speckle pattern, are magnified when the distance r is increased. The effect is negligible when the 
change in distance is negligible to the distance r. 
 

 

Figure  2.6:  The  loss  of  correlation  due  to  the  magnification  of  the  speckle  pattern 
when the distance r is increased. The speckles are represented by circles and the red 
speckles represent the image as captured by the CCD at a smaller distance than the 
black ones. 

2.3.3  Radial displacement 
Placing the sample under a different angle with respect to the recording screen results in a different 
speckle pattern at the screen. A small misalignment will cause the CCD to record a different part of the 
speckle pattern. One can find the angle ? when the CCD, with a width d, records a complete new part 
of the speckle pattern: 
 

q

=

tan 1

,

 

 

d
r

 
where r is the distance between the sample and the recording screen. At angles larger than ? there is no 
correlation expected. 

2.4  Recognition criterion 
Samples will be recognized by analyzing the correlation function (Appendix D) of two measurements. 
The correlation functions consist of several peaks which can originate from either a correspondence of 
the  internal  structure  of  the  samples  or  from  coincidently  coinciding  speckles  (CCS)  in  both 
measurements.  From  the  probability  that  a  peak  represents  CCS  one  can  judge  whether  a  sample  is 
recognized. 

To calculate the probability of a peak representing CCS, Gaussian statistics will be used. The 
use of Gaussian statistics is justified when events are caused additively and independently, we do not

know whether this is the case for correlation functions of speckle patterns. Some further research on 
this topic is required. 

The Gaussian probability distribution is defined as

(2.11) 

(2.12) 

 
where µ is the average and s  is the standard deviation. To determine whether a peak represents CCS 
the cumulative distribution is used. The probability that there exists a peak n larger than a value a is 
given by: 
 

nP

When  this  probability  is  negligible  one  can  state  that  the  sample  is  recognized.  The  probability  of 
finding a peak larger than a depends on the total number of peaks. Assuming that all 512*512 pixels 
are independent and N correlations are done, the probability of finding a peak larger than a is:  
 
 

.   
 
We define the number of correlations that can be performed before finding a second peak caused by 
CCS as the uniqueness U:

In our research an attempt to distinguish 10 samples will done, this yields 100 correlations. A ratio of 
6.5 between the correlation peak and the standard deviation of the correlation is used, corresponding to 
a uniqueness of 105. Because 100 correlations will be made, there is a probability of 99.9 % that one 
recognizes the sample properly.  
 

Although  speckles  are  build  up  out  of  several  pixels,  which  makes  some  pixels  correlated,  this 
analysis  assumes  the  pixels  to  be  independent.  The  correlation  between  the  pixels  can  be  taken  into 
account by stating that the number of speckles is the number of independent channels. This approach 
does not take the position of the speckles into account, which is measurable with an accuracy of the 
pixel  size.  Omitting  this  position  effect  would  overestimate  the  uniqueness  factor  whereas  our 
approach underestimates it. How to deal with this problem requires some further research. A simple 
solution  could  be  to  match  the  speckle  size  with  the  pixel  size.  This  solution  might  lead  to 
experimental problems because the speckles vary in size. 

Besides  that  the  pixels  are  correlated  due  to  the  fact  that  they  represent  a  speckle  together,  the 

pixels are always correlated because the CCD is not ideal.

3  Experimental apparatus  
Because  both  a  line  and  a  spot  will  be  used  in  the  experiments,  the  setup  (see  Figure  3)  is  able  to 
switch easily between illumination by a line and a spot. The light goes either along the path depicted 
by the dotted line or along the path depicted by the dashed line. The first results in an circular spot and 
the  second  in  a  elliptical  spot.  One  can  switch  from  one  configuration  to  another  by  turning  both 
flipping mirrors. 

The laser light is scattered by the sample and collected by the CCD[5]. The CCD is mounted on 
a  rotational  arm  (accuracy  1·10-2°).  The  distance  r  between  the  CCD  and  the  sample  can  be  varied 
(accuracy  0.5mm).  The  sample  is  held  in  a  standard  clip-type  filter  holder.  This  sample  holder  is 
connected to the translational stage via screws which allows one to remount the holder within an error 
of 0.5 mm and an error of 0.5o in the angle under which the light is reflected. Once the sample holder 
is mounted on the translational stage it can moved along the dotted line with 1 µm accuracy.

Figure 3.1: A schematic representation of the setup. Lens 1 and lens 2 magnify the beam. Lens 3 focuses 
the beam to a line on the sample. Lens 4 is used to create a circular spot by focusing the incoming beam 
onto the sample. The CCD is mounted on a rotational arm allowing measurements of the speckle pattern 
under different angles and distances. 

In the setup a plano convex lens (lens 4) with a focal distance of 200 mm was used to focus the 
HeNe laser[6] beam to a round spot of 365 ± 5 µm diameter. As shown in Appendix B this is 3.35 ± 
0.08 times the diffraction limit.  

A spot of 1.93 ± 0.01mm was created by collimating the light with two lenses (lens 1 and lens 
2) and using a diaphragm. This spot was focused with a cylindrical lens (lens 3) with a focal length of 
60 mm to an elliptical spot of 69 ± 1 µm short axis. The length of the line is 1.65 ± 0.02 times the 
diffraction limit and the width is 3.35 ± 0.08 times the diffraction limit (see appendix C). Especially 
the that fact the large side of the line meets the diffraction limit better was expected. One has to note 
that the diaphragm used to create a line introduces and extra loss in intensity and changes the beam 
profile. The area of both the elliptical beam and spot are (1.07 ± 0.03)·105 µm2
,  the importance of this 
has been stressed in 2.3.1. 

We  used  plain  white  paper  samples  which  were  available  in  the  lab.  Unfortunately  no 
specifications  about  these  samples  were  available.  One  of  the  samples  was  measured  to  be  42.65  ± 
0.05 mm by 99.70 ± 0.05 mm and 0.40 ± 0.05 mm thick, its weight was 1.1982 ± 0.0005 g. Thus the 
paper was 281.8 ± 0.6 g/m2. All the samples were made of the same kind of paper.

In this chapter the final results will be presented in some plots. In the first paragraph the effect of a 
displacement  of  the  sample  in  x-direction,  the  sensitivity  to  a  variation  in  the  r-direction  and 
measurements on the angular dependence will be presented and discussed. These measurements were 
done for both the line and the spot. 

The  recommendations  which  followed  from  these  measurements  are  described  in  paragraph 
4.2.  Some  parameters  of  the  setup  were  adjusted  for  the  recognition  attempt.  The  sensitivity  to  a 
displacement in x-direction was measured in this new configuration.  

For  the  recognition  attempt  the  new  configuration  was  used,  the  results  of  this  attempt  are 
discussed in paragraph 4.3. In this paragraph it is also shown that samples can be recognized with high 
uniqueness factors, enabling industrial applications.  

4.1  The measurements on the line and spot 
In  this  section  the  sensitivity  of  the  speckle  pattern  to  displacements  in  x,  r  and  ?  direction  will  be 
discussed and compared to the analyses in chapter 2. 

4.1.1  Displacement in x-direction 
In  Figure  4.1  the  results  of  the  displacement  measurement  of  the  365  ±  5  µm  spot  are  shown.  All 
measurements  of  the  series  in  the  range  of  0  µm  to  280  µm  (20  µm  steps)  were  correlated  to  the 
measurements at a displacement of 0 µm, 40 µm, 120 µm, 240 µm and 280 µm of the same series. This 
resulted in two dimensional correlation functions C(x,y) of which both the peak value and the standard 
deviation  were  calculated.  Of  all  correlation  functions  there  are  five  autocorrelation  functions,  the 
‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratios of these functions are plotted at zero displacement.  

 

 

Figure 4.1: The sensitivity of the speckle pattern 
to  a  variation  in  the  x-direction.  The  speckle  is 
caused  by  a  circular  spot  of  365  µm.  In  the 
legend  one  can  see  to  what  measurement  the 
shown measurements are correlated.  

Figure 4.2: The sensitivity of the speckle pattern 
to  a  variation  in  the  x-direction.  The  speckle  is 
caused  by  a  line.  In  the  legend  one  can  see  to 
which  measurement  the  shown  measurements 
are correlated.  

 
Since a ‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratio of 6.5 is a good measure for recognition, the  

sample can be displaced over a distance of minimum 200 ± 10 µm if one uses the spot. 

For the line the approach was similar, the results are plotted in Figure 4.2. The measurement 
series were from 0 µm to 80 µm (5 µm steps) and series were correlated to the measurements at 15, 25, 
35, 45, and 55 µm.  

Figure  4.2  shows  that  the  line  is  more  sensitive  to  changes  in  x-direction,  even  when  it  is 
considered relative to the spot its width. The sample can be moved 54 ± 1 % of the spots diameter, 
whereas  the  sample  can  only  be  moved  25  ±  5  %  relative  to  the  lines  width.  This  contradicts  the 
analysis in paragraph 2.3.1 for unknown reasons.  

These measurements indicate that when a spot is larger the maximum allowed displacement in 
x-direction, when measured relative to the spot size, is larger too.  Since our system can easily produce 
a 2.62 ± 0.02 mm spot it is recommended to use this spot for the recognition attempt.

4.1.2  Variation CCD-sample distance 
The  influence  of  a  variation  of  the  distance  between  the  CCD  and  the  sample  (r)  was  subjected  to 
research at distances of 5.5, 17.6 and 36.7 cm between sample and CCD. We varied the distance r with 
steps of 1 mm. Because the sample can be replaced with 0.5 mm accuracy the variations in the speckle 
pattern  due  to  a  variation  in  distance  can  be  neglected  when  the  system  is  insensitive  to  1  mm 
variations. 

In Figure 4.3 and 4.4 the ‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratio is plotted as a function of the 
displacement in r-direction. Three series were performed, namely at 5.4 cm, 17.5 cm and 32.6 cm. For 
the measurements shown in figure 4.3 a spot was used and for the measurements in Figure 4.4 a line.   
The results in Figure 4.3 show that the system is indeed less sensitive to changes in r-direction 
when the distance between CCD and sample is large. In case of the spot the ‘peak value to standard 
deviation’-ratio remains constant and is sufficient for recognition at a distance of 17.5 cm.  

Remarkably,  the  ‘peak  value  to  standard  deviation’-ratio  is  very  low  when  the  sample  is 
placed at 17.5 cm and 32.6 cm. The ratio is low due to the broad correlation peak which contributes 
significantly to the standard deviation of the correlation. The wide correlation peak is caused by the 
large speckles.  

To reduce the speckles in size either the spot has to be increased or the speckles have to be 
focused. In our current setup the spot size can be increased by a factor of 7.2 to 2.62 ± 0.02 mm. If this 
spot is used at 30 cm, this will be comparable to measuring at 4.2 cm but with the advantage of lower 
sensitivity to changes in r-direction.  
 

Figure 4.3: In this plot the distance dependence of the 
spot  is  shown.  At  larger  distances  the  ‘peak  value  to 
standard  deviation’-ratio  is  low,  due  to  the  large 
speckles.  At  17.5  cm  the  correlation  remains  constant 
and  sufficient  for  recognition.  At  32.6  cm 
the 
correlation is too low due to the large speckles 

 

Figure  4.4:  In  this  plot  the  distance  dependence  is  of 
the line is shown. At larger distances the ‘peak value 
to  standard  deviation’-ratio  is  low,  due  to  the  large 
speckles.  

 

4.1.3  Dependence CCD-Sample angle 
The  angular  dependence  was  measured  by  varying  the  angle  ?(see  figure  2.3)  of  the  CCD  with 
respect to the sample. A distance of 10.0 ± 0.1 cm was used and the CCD was moved with 0.5 o steps. 
All measurements of this series have been correlated to the measurement at 0o and the result is shown 
in Figure 4.5. According to our criterion there was no correlation at 3.3 ± 0.3o which corresponds to a 
movement of 5.8 ± 0.5 mm. It was expected that the correlation would be lost at 6.9 mm, the width of 
the CCD. We expect there is a correlation between 5.8 ± 0.5 mm and 6.9 mm, but this correlation is 
probably so small that it can not be distinguished from peaks caused by CCS. 

 

12 

 

 

Figure 4.5: In this plot the angular dependence can be seen. As expected the plot is 
linear. At an angle of 3.3 ± 0.3 there is no significant correlation left.  

 
Furthermore the plot shows that with a line we measure a better peak to standard deviation ratio, 
the difference is 30 times the standard deviation. This phenomenon can be seen in Figures 4.1 and 4.2 
as well, where the difference between the line and the spot is 15 times the standard deviation.   

This phenomenon might be explained by the loss in intensity at the diaphragm as discussed in 

paragraph 2.1, but it requires some further research. 

4.2  Changes in the setup for successful recognition 
In  the  former  paragraphs  two  recommendations  were  done  for  the  recognition  measurement,  first  to 
increase the distance r to 30 cm and second to use a larger spot. Before the recognition attempt, it was 
checked whether the larger distance does not change the sensitivity to displacements in the x-direction. 
Measurements  on  the  large  spot  of  2.62  ±  0.02  mm  at  a  distance  of  30  cm  were  performed.  The 
minimum displacement which would obtain sufficient correlation is 0.9 ± 0.1 mm.  

Figure: 4.6: The sensitivity of the speckle pattern to a variation in the position. The 
speckle is caused by a spot of 2.62 ± 0.02 mm and measured at a distance of 30 cm.  

 
Remarkably, the possible movement relative to the spot size is less for the larger spot. namely 
35 ± 4 % of the spot its width instead of 54 ± 1 % . From Figures 4.1 and 4.2 it was expected that the 
percentage would increase when the spot size was increased. Since both the spot size and the distance 
r were increased we conclude the distance influences the sensitivity in x-direction.    

4.3  Results of the recognition attempt 
With the adjusted setup a recognition attempt was performed. Ten samples were placed in a holder and 
their speckle patterns were measured. The samples were removed from the translational stage together 
with  the  holder.  The  samples  were  stored  in  the  holder  for  thirty  minutes  in  normal  laboratory 
conditions  

The first measurement of sample X was correlated with all measurements of the second series. 
The correlation with the highest ‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratio was selected. When this was 
indeed  the  correlation  with  the  second  measurement  of  sample  X,  and  the  ‘peak  value  to  standard 
deviation’-ratio was larger than 6.5, the sample is considered recognized. This procedure was done for 
all measurements of the first series. In Figure 4.7 it is shown that 5 samples have been recognized.  

 

13 

 

Figure 4.7: The recognition of five out of ten samples. This plot shows the potential 
of our setup, since very high uniqueness factor have been obtained.  

 
It  is  interesting  to  see  that  the  ‘peak  value  to  standard  deviation’-ratios  differ  very 
significantly. Most ratios will not be sufficient for recognizing large numbers of samples. Buchanan et 
al.  used  a  criterion  which  corresponds  to  a  ratio  of  approximately  20  for  their  experiment  with  500 
samples.  All  samples  which  could  not  be  recognized  have  a  peak  of  approximately  5  times  the 
standard deviation, as expected.  

Sample 8 is recognized with a ‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratio of 32. The value of 32 
indicates that the measurements can be done more precise since Figure 4.6 shows that the maximum 
possible ratio is 60 and that a ratio of 30 corresponds to a misplacement of 0.5 mm. The fact that the 
maximum ratio is reduced strongly indicates that the sample holder needs to be improved.  

Especially  the  angle  at  which  the  sample  is  placed  was  quite  critical  because  the  distance 
between sample and CCD was large. The accuracy in x-direction for placing the sample holder was 
probably  problematic  too;  the  accuracy  of  replacing  the  sample  holder  was  estimated  at  0.5mm.  As 
shown  in  figure  4.3,  the  correlation  remains  constant  over  a  distance  r  for  more  than  2  mm  and 
therefore variation in r-direction is not likely to cause problems.

5  Conclusion 
In this report the reproducibility of a speckle pattern caused by a line and a spot have been compared. 
The use of a line always results in a better ‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratio. Recognition of 5 
out of 10 samples was achieved by using a large spot and a CCD. In our opinion this setup has the 
potential of distinguishing large numbers of samples. 

It was shown that a line is more sensitive to changes in x-direction. The sample can be moved 
54 ± 1 % of the spots diameter, whereas the sample can be moved only 25 ± 5 % relative to the lines 
width. This result contradicts the expectation that the sensitivity to a relative movement is independent 
of beam shape. 

The  measurements  on  the  distance  between  the  CCD  and  the  sample  have  shown  that  it  is 

preferential to work at a large distance, under the condition that the speckles are small enough.  

The behavior of the angular dependence appears to be the same in the case of the line and the 
spot.  We  found  that  only  the  area  of  the  CCD  is  limiting.  At  an  angle  of  3.3  ±  0.3o  there  is  no 
significant correlation left. This is the point where the chip is moved 5.8 ± 0.5 mm of the chip its width 
of  6.9mm.  We  expected  a  correlation  between  5.8  ±  0.5  mm  and  6.9  mm,  but  this  correlation  is 
probably so small that it can not be distinguished from peaks caused by CCS. 

An attempt to distinguish samples resulted in the recognition of five out of ten paper samples. 
These  results  were  obtained  using  a  2.62  ±  0.02  mm  circular  spot  and  a  CCD.  The  sample  was 
positioned  at  30  cm  with  respect  to  the  CCD.  We  suspect  that  five  samples  were  not  recognized 
because the required accuracy of replacing the samples was not met. The setup has a large potential of 
recognizing  a  large  amount  of  samples  since  recognition  with  a  ‘peak  value  to  standard  deviation’-
ratio of 32 was obtained after thirty minutes and replacing the sample holder. This measurement has 
not been optimal since it has been shown that a ‘peak value to standard deviation’-ratio of 60 can be 
obtained.

6  Recommendations 
The setup will yield better results when a sample holder with hardly any angular dependence is used. 
When the CCD is integrated in the same construction as the sample holder, the angular dependence is 
strongly reduced. By sliding the paper into the holder and pressing it against a wall, the variation in x-
direction can be minimized too.  

A larger experiment should be performed. When 500 samples are taken a uniqueness factor of 
1083  will  be  required.  This  experiment  requires  the  significant  improvements  of  the  sample  holder 
mentioned above. 

A distance dependence in the sensitivity to displacements in x-direction was found. When the 
365 ± 5 µm spot was used at 10.0 cm the sample could be displaced 54 ± 1 % of the spot its width. In 
case  of  the  line  this  was  less,  namely  25  ±  5  %.  When  the  spot  was  increased  this  percentage  was 
expected to increase too, but it decreased to 35 ± 4 %. Because the distance was increased to 30 cm 
together with increasing the spot size, a distance dependence is expected. The distance dependence can 
be explained by reasoning that the CCD does not “see” the borders of the spot anymore when it is very 
close  to  the  sample.  The  simple  case  of  an  infinite  spot  illustrates  the  effect  of  the  border  well;  the 
speckle pattern moves as much as the displacement of the sample. In the case of the infinite spot, the 
correlation becomes proportional to the area of the speckle pattern measured by the CCD before and 
after movement of the sample. 

The  fourth  recommendation  concerns  the  optimization  of  the  distance  between  sample  and 
CCD. Increasing the distance is advantageous for variations in r-direction, but the angular sensitivity 
and sensitivity in x-direction are smaller when decreasing the distance, therefore an optimum distance 
can be found. 

The last recommendation concerns the fact that the correlations of the line are always stronger 
than those of the spot. This effect might be caused by the diaphragm; this hypothesis can be verified 
with a simple experiment.

Appendix A: Order-of-Magnitude estimation of a speckle 
 
Using a few simple arguments one can make a quick order-of-magnitude estimation for the size of a 
speckle [4]. For this one needs to suppose that a bright speckle is present at some point P at the screen 
(see Figure A.1). At this point the light coming from the sample interferes mainly constructively. To 
1D  interferes constructively with O, P 
simplify the calculation one can assume that, on average, point 
’with O’ etc. For an estimation of the speckle size one needs to find a new point,
2D , where P and O’, 
P’ and O’, etc. interfere destructively.  
 
corresponding change in the path length difference 
1OD  is equal to  (x2+L2)1/2 and 
that d<<L, 

Taking  for  example  points  P1  and  P2,  one  needs  to  find  the  change  dx  such  that  the 
OD -
1OD  – 
(
d
is equal to ?\2. Since 
1PD  is (((d/2)-x)2 + L2)1/2, one obtains, together with the assumption

Appendix B: Diffraction limited size of the spot  
 
In this appendix the calculations on the spot size of our setup will be presented.  
 
The circular spot was produced by focusing the laser light with a 200 mm lens after it had diverged 
over a distance of 1.05 m. At the lens the waist is given by the following formula; 
 

 
where 

waist 

lw ,0  is the waist of the laser, 0.315 mm and ? is 632.8 nm. This beam is then focused to the 
fw ,0 by a 200 mm lens:

Then the light is expanded by two lenses. First the beam is further diverged by a negative lens with a -
75mm focal distance; it propagates over a distance of 175mm. Then the light is focused by a 250 mm 
 which focuses the light to a 
lens. The expansion of the beam can be represented by a 75mm lens

When performing these calculations one obtains a length of 584±4 µm. All components can be 
placed with 1 cm accuracy. By filling in al the distances plus or minus a centimetre one can estimate 
the error.

Cross  correlation  is  a  standard  method  of  estimating  the  degree  to  which  two  signals  are 
similar. When one wants to have a quantitative measure of shared properties of two random signals 
one can use such a correlation function. The cross correlation may be defined as:

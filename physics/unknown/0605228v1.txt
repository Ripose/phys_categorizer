Abstract—The  race  to  engineering  metamaterials  comprising 
of a negative refractive index in the optical range has been fueled 
by  the  realization  of  negative 
index  materials  for  GHz 
frequencies  six  years  ago.  Sheer  miniaturization  of  the  GHz 
resonant  structures  is  one  approach.  Alternative  designs  make 
use  of 
localized  plasmon  resonant  metal  nanoparticles  or 
nanoholes  in  metal  films.  Following  this  approach,  a  negative 
refractive  index  has  been  realized  in  the  optical  range  very 
recently.  We  review  these  recent  results  and  summarize  how  to 
unambiguously  retrieve  the  effective  refractive  index  of  thin 
layers 
from  data  accessible  to  measurements.  Numerical 
simulations  show  that  a  composite  material  comprising  of  silver 
strips  and  a  gain  providing  material  can  have  a  negative 
refractive index of -1.3 and 100% transmission, simultaneously.

EFRACTIVE  index  is  the  most  fundamental  parameter  to 
describe the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with 
  where  n′   has 
matter.  It  is  a  complex  number 
generally been considered to be positive. While the condition 
0<′n
  does  not  violate  any  fundamental  physical  law, 
materials with negative index have some unusual and counter-
intuitive  properties.  For  example,  light,  which  is  refracted  at 
an interface between a positive and a negative index material, 
is bent in the “wrong” way with respect to the normal, group- 
and  phase  velocities  are  anti-parallel,  wave  and  Pointing

a  left-handed  system.  Because  of  these  properties,  such 
materials are synonymously called “left handed” or negative-
index  materials.  Theoretical  work  on  negative  phase  velocity 
dates  back  to  Lamb  (in  hydrodynamics)  [1]  or  Schuster  (in

In general, left handed materials do not exist naturally, with 
some  rare  exceptions  like  bismuth  that  shows 
  at  a 
wavelength of 
 [6]. However, no naturally existing 
negative  index  material  has  been  discovered  for  the  optical 
range of frequencies. Therefore, it is necessary to turn to man 
made,  artificial  materials  which  are  composed  in  such  a  way 
that the averaged (effective) refractive index is less than zero:

interior  structure  of  the  material  is  not  sub-wavelength. 
Consequently,  PCs  do  not  show  the  full  range  of  possible 
benefits  of  left  handed  materials.  For  example,  super-
resolution,  which  has  been  predicted  by  Pendry  [12],  is  not

Up to now, we have only considered isotropic media where 
ε and  µ are complex scalar numbers. It has been shown that 
in the case of anisotropic media, where  ε and  µ are tensors,

will  not  focus  on  that  topic  here.  This  is  mainly  because  a 
negative index for optical frequencies has only been achieved 
so far following the approach of magnetically active media.

The  paper  is  organized  as  follows:  In  section  II  we  recall 
how  to  achieve  magnetic  activity  for  GHz  frequencies  using 
metallic  split  ring  resonators  (SRR)  and  how  the  SRRs  have 
been successively scaled down to shift the magnetic resonance 
up to THz frequencies. When the optical range is approached, 
the finite skin depth of metals as well as localized plasmonic 
resonances  must  be  considered  in  addition  to  the  simple 
geometric scaling of metallic structures. This opens the way to 
new design outlines making active use of localized plasmonic 
effects  as  it  will  be  outlined  in  section  III.  Metamaterials 
containing  metal  nanostructures  as  magnetically  active 
components  usually  show  low  transmission  due  to  reflection 
and  absorption.  In  section  IV  we  develop  an  impedance-
matched design to suppress reflection. In section V we add a 
gain  material  to  compensate  for  losses  and  finally  obtain  a 
fully transparent layer of negative index metamaterial.  

II.  DOWNSCALING SPLIT RING RESONATORS 

The  first  recipee  how  to  design  a  magnetically  active 
material  was  suggested  by  Pendry  in  1999  [18]:  Two 
concentric split rings that face in opposite directions and that 
are  of  subwavelength  dimensions  were  predicted  to  give  rise 
0<′µ  (Fig. 1a). One can regard this as an electronic circuit 
to 
consisting  of  inductive  and  capacitive  elements.  The  rings 
form  the  inductances  and  the  two  slits  as  well  as  the  gap 
between  the  two  rings  can  be  considered  as  capacitors.  A 
magnetic field which is oriented perpendicular to the plane of 
drawing induces an opposing magnetic field in the loop due to 
Lenz’s law. This leads to a diamagnetic response and hence to 
a  negative  real  part  of  the  permeability.  The  capacitors  (the 
two  slits  and  the  gap  between  the  rings)  are  necessary  to 
assure that the wavelength of the resonance is larger than the 
dimensions of the SRR. 

Very  soon  after  that  theoretical  prediction,  Schultz  and 
coworkers  combined  the  split  ring  resonators  (SRR)  with  a 
material  that  shows  negative  electric  response in the 10  GHz 
range  and  consists  of  metallic  wires  in  order  to  reduce  the 
charge carrier density and hence shift the plasmonic response 
from  optical  frequencies  down  to  GHz  frequencies  (Fig.  1b) 
[19].  The  outcome  was  the  first-ever  metamaterial  with 
simultaneously negative real parts of the permeability and the 
permittivity  [20]  and  consequently  with  a  negative  refractive 
index at approximately 10 GHz (Fig. 1c) [21, 22]. From now

on the race to push left handedness to higher frequencies was 
open.  The  GHz  resonant  SRRs  had  a  diameter  of  several 
millimeters,  but  size  reduction  leads  to  a  higher  frequency 
response.  The  resonance  frequency  has  been  pushed  up  to 
1THz using this scaling technique [23, 24].  

An alternative to double SRRs is to fabricate only one SRR 
facing a metallic mirror and use its mirror image as the second 
SRR [25]. Using that technique, the resonance frequency has 
been  shifted  to  50  THz.  In  order  to  increase  the  frequency 
even more, simply downscaling of the geometrical dimensions 
with  wavelength  becomes  questionable  because  localized 
plasmonic  effects  must  be  considered.  However,  localized 
plasmons  open  a  wide  field  of new design opportunities. For 
example,  a  double  C-shaped  SRR  is  not  required  any  more. 
Originally,  the  double  C-shaped  structure  was  necessary  in 
order  to  shift  the  resonance  frequency  to  sufficiently  low 
frequencies  such  that  the  requirement  of  sub  wavelength 
dimension  could  be  fulfilled.  In  the  optical  range,  however, 
localized  plasmons  help  to  shift  resonance  frequencies  to 
lower energies and consequently, the doubling of the split ring 
is not necessary [26]. The first experimental proof that single 
SRRs  show  an  electric  response  at  3.5  µm  (85  THz)  was 
provided  in  2004  by  Linden  and  coworkers  [27]  and  it  was 
concluded  that  the  magnetic  response  of  single  SRRs  should 
be  found  at  the  same  frequency.  Meanwhile  the  electric 
resonance frequencies of single SRRs has even been pushed to 
the  important  telecom  wavelength  of  1.5  µm  [28].  Other 
approaches  to  creating  metamaterials  with  magnetic  activity 
that make use of localized plasmonic resonances, and abandon 
the  classical  split  ring  resonator  shape  completely,  will  be 
discussed in the following section. 

 

III.  METAMATERIALS USING LOCALIZED PLASMONIC 
RESONANCES 

A.  Metal Nanorods 
It was mentioned by Lagarkov and Sarychev [29] that a pair 
of  noble  metal  nanorods  can  show  a  large  paramagnetic 
response, and it was first pointed out by Podolskiy et al. [30] 
that  such  a  pair  of  noble  metal  nanorods  is  also  capable  of  a 
diamagnetic response at 1500  nm. In  this publication [30],  it 
was predicted for the first time, that materials containing such 
pairs  of  rods  can  show  a  negative  n′   even  for  visible 
wavelengths.  The  issue  has  been  discussed  in  more  detail  by 
Panina  et  al.  [26]  and  also  by  Podolskiy  et  al.  [31,  32].  It  is 
illustrated  in  figure  2  how  a  pair  of  nanorods  can  show  a 
negative  response  to  an  electromagnetic  plane  wave.  Two 
gold  rods  are  separated  by  a  distance  far  less  than  the 
wavelength.  The  diameter  of  the  cross  section  of  the  rods  is 
also much less than the wavelength and the length of the rods 
may  be,  but  does  not  need  to  be  in  the  range  of  half  of  the 
wavelength.  An  AC  electric  field  parallel  to  both  rods  will 
induce parallel currents in both rods which are in phase or out

electrodynamically  coupled  rods.  Fig.  2a  shows  the  induced

cylindrically shaped rods), and a distance of 80 nm.

Let  us  now  consider  the  magnetic  field  which  shall  be 
oriented perpendicular to the plane of the rods. This magnetic 
field will cause anti-parallel currents in the two rods as shown 
in Fig. 2b. This can be considered as a dipolar magnetic mode. 
The  magnetic  response  will  be  dia-  or  paramagnetic 
depending  on  whether  the  wavelength  of  the  incoming 
magnetic  field  is  shorter  or  longer  than  the  dipolar  magnetic 
eigenfrequency  of  the  electrodynamically  coupled  rods  (Fig. 
2b, after [32]). In terms of coupled plasmonic resonances the 
magnetic dipole resonance appears at the same wavelength as 
the  electric  quadrupole  resonance.  However,  the  latter  does 
not contribute to the electromagnetic radiation in the direction 
given in Fig. 2c [31].  

So far,  the electromagnetic response  has been  discussed in

terms of coupled plasmonic resonances. An alternative way of 
looking  at  it  is  that  the  anti-parallel  currents  in  the  rods  and 
the  displacement  currents  at  the  ends  of  the  two  rods  form  a 
current loop or an inductance, while the gaps at the ends form 
two capacitors. The result is a resonant LC-circuit [29, 33].  

It is important that both resonances, the dipolar electric and 
the  dipolar  magnetic  resonance  are  at  similar  wavelengths. 
This  requires  that  the  coupling  between  the  two  rods  should 
not  be  too  strong,  because  otherwise  the  two  resonances 
would be split further apart. It is seen in figures 2 a and b that 
there is a certain range of wavelengths (between 500 and 600 
nm)  where  both,  the  induced  electric  and  the  induced 
magnetic  dipole  moments  are  opposing  the  incident  fields. 
Hence, an electromagnetic plane wave impinging from above 
and  with  E  and  H  oriented  as  shown  in  Fig.  2c  (TM 
polarization) will induce a double negative response.  

To 

the  best  of  our  knowledge, 

the  unambiguous 
measurement  of  a  negative  refractive  index  in  the  optical 
range (specifically, at the optical telecom wavelength of 1500 
nm)  was  reported  for  the  first  time  in  Ref.  [34,  35].  The 
metamaterial  in  which  the  negative  refractive  index  was 
achieved  is  outlined  in  Fig.  3.  Pairs  of  nanorods  were 
fabricated  on  a  glass  substrate  using  electron  beam 
lithography. The actual structure of the gold nanorod doublets 
is shown in Fig. 3a. The nanorods are 50 nm thick, stacked on 
top of the glass substrate, and a 50 nm thick SiO2 layer is used 
as  a  spacer.  The  upper  rod  is  smaller  in  dimensions  than  the 
lower  rod.  A  SEM  micrograph  of  a  single  pair  and  its 
dimensions  is  shown  in  Fig.  3a.  Pairs  of  nanorods  are 
periodically  repeated  as  depicted  in  Fig.  3b  and  shown  by  a 
SEM micrograph in Fig. 3c. Figure 3d shows the unit cell of 
the  periodic  arrangement  and  gives  more  dimensions.  A  full 
description of the sample and its preparation, is given in [35-
37].  A  similar  sample  containing  pairs  of  gold  nanoparticles 
show  reflection  spectra  that  can  be  explained  if  a  negative

It turns out to be non trivial to experimentally determine the 
exact  value  of  the  refractive  index  for  a  thin  film.  In  the 
present case, the film of negative refraction was only 160 nm 
thick.  Therefore,  the  straightforward  method  of  determining 
n   by  applying  Snell’s  law  to  the  incoming  and  refracted 
beams can not be used. A different method to unambiguously 
determine the refractive index requires the measurement of the 
transmission  T , the reflectance  R  and the absolute phases of 
the  transmitted  and  reflected  electric  fields  τ   and  ρ, 
respectively.  If  those  four  quantities  are  measured,  the

sandwiched  between  air  (top)  and  a  glass  substrate  (bottom) 
can  be  determined  uniquely  as  it  has  been  discussed  in  [37,

The importance to measure τ  and  ρ in addition to  T  and 
R   was  emphasized  in  [36]  where  it  was  shown  that  two 
similar,  but  not  identical,  samples  of  pair  of  nanorods  can 
show  the  same  values  T   and  R   (within  experimental  error) 
but greatly differ in τ . Consequently, one sample was found 
to have negative  n′  while for the other one  n′  is positive. 

Figure  5a  shows  the  transmission  and  reflection  spectra  of 
the negative index metamaterial of Fig. 3. In order to measure 
the absolute phase, the beam of a tunable semiconductor laser 
was  split  in  two  orthogonally  polarized  beams,  where  one 
beam  passed  through  the  negative  index  metamaterial  of 
thickness  ∆  while the other beam was used as a reference and 
passed  only  through  the  glass  substrate  at a spot not  covered 
by  the  metamaterial  [36],  (Fig.  5b).  The  beams  were 
recombined  behind  the  glass  substrate.  The  phase  difference

τ   between  the  beam  passing  through  the  thin  film  and  the 
reference  beam  propagating  only  through  air  of  the  same 
thickness  ∆   was  determined  using  interferometry  (Fig.  5c). 
The  phase  shifts  in  reflection  ( ρ)  were  obtained  for  both 
polarizations in a similar way.  

In  [35]  it  was  found  that  the  phase  τ   is  delayed  in  the 
metamaterial  by  approx.  60°  compared  to  air  in  case  of  TE 
polarization (electric field perpendicular to the plane of rods). 
In  contrast,  τ   is  advanced  by  approx.  20°  in  case  of  TM 
polarization  (Fig.5c,  Ref.  [35]).  The  advancement  of  τ   for 
TM polarization can be used as an indirect evidence of

These  two  formula  indeed  give  an  upper  and  lower  bound 
to  the  correct  value  of  n′   according  to  equations  (2)  and  (3) 
(see Fig.6) [37].  

B.  Voids 
An interesting approach to negative index metamaterials is 
to  take  the  inverse  of  a  resonant  structure  [40], e.g. a  pair  of 
voids  as the inverse of a pair  of nanorods [41-43]. The basic 
idea  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  7a.  Instead of a pair  of metal nano-
ellipses separated by an oxide, which are similar to the pair of 
rods  in  Fig.  2,  two  thin  films  of  metal  are  separated  by  an 
oxide  and  mounted  on  a  glass  substrate.  Then,  an  elliptically 
shaped  void  is  etched  in  the  films  (Fig.  7a,  right  hand  side), 
thus  forming  the  negative  of  the  original  paired  metal ellipse 
structure  (Fig.  7a,  left  hand  side).  Both  samples  should  have 
similar resonance behavior if the orientation of the electric and 
magnetic fields are also interchanged. FDTD simulations were 
performed 
index  of  void 
metamaterials [37]. The dimensions were chosen according to 
Fig. 7b in the simulations in order to match the dimensions of 
the experimental sample reported in [43].

These  simulations  were  carried  out  for  both  cases  of 
polarizations: the electric field oriented along the long axis of 
the  elliptical  voids  and  perpendicular  to  it.  It  is  seen  that  n′  
becomes  negative  in  both  cases,  however,  the  effect  is  more 
pronounced if the electric field is oriented along the short axis 
(Fig.  7c).  Further  more,  at  approximately  1600  nm  the  real 
part  of  n   is  negative  while  the  imaginary  part  is  less  than  1 
indicating  lower  losses  compared  to  the  double  rod  sample

discussed  before,  where  the  imaginary  part  of  the  refractive 
index  was  3  [35].  Experimental  measurements  with  samples 
similar  to  those  sketched  in  Fig.  7a,  but  with  spherical  voids 
instead  of  elliptical  voids,  confirmed  a  negative  n′   at  a 
wavelength  of  2  µm  [41].  The  imaginary  part  n ′′   is  large  in 
that case, however it has been shown that further optimization 
can reduce  n ′′  substantially [43].  

IV.  PAIRS OF METAL STRIPS FOR IMPEDANCE MATCHED 
NEGATIVE INDEX METAMATERIALS 

Metamaterials  using  plasmon  resonant  metal  nanoparticles 
have two distinct problems, each of them reducing the overall 
transmission  through  the  metamaterial:  The  first  one  is 
absorptive  losses  (in  terms  of  a  large  n ′′ ),  because  ohmic 
losses  are  generally  large  due  to  the  excitation  of  localized 
plasmon resonances in the nanostructures. A possible solution 
to  this  problem  will  be  discussed  in  the  next  section.  In  this 
section  we  will  concentrate  on  the  second  issue,  which  is

simultaneously  for  a  visible  wavelength.  The  structure 
consists  of  pairs  of  coupled  silver  strips.  Both  strips  are  280 
nm  wide  (x-direction),  16  nm  thick,  and  they  are  infinitely 
long  in  the  y-direction.  The  two silver strips  are separated  in 
the z-direction by a 65 nm thick layer of Al2O3. The pairs of 
strips are periodically repeated in the x-direction with a period 
of 500 nm. We assume air above and below the layer of strips. 
In our finite element frequency domain (FEMFD) simulations 
this  layer  of  metamaterial  is  illuminated  from  above  with 
plane  waves  at  normal  incidence  (along  the  z-direction).  The 
electric  field  is  polarized  in  the  x-direction.  The  magnetic 
field,  which  is  parallel  to  the  strips,  induces  anti-parallel 
currents  in  the  two silver strips  as indicated in  the  magnified 
inset  of  Fig.  8a  by  the  two  white  arrows.  This  leads  to  a

be seen in Fig. 9a that the transmission has a local maximum 
of  51%  at  582  nm.  This  is  because  the  reflection  has  a  local 
minimum and the absorption is limited. Indeed, the impedance 
  and 
is  matched  quite  well  from  582  to  589  nm, i.e. 
eventually  reaching  1  at  586  nm,  and  simultaneously 
5.0<′′Z
  in  the  range  570  -  585  nm  (Fig.  9c).  In  total,  this 

5.0>′Z

leads to a reflectance of less than 10% at 584 nm.  

The absorption seems to have a local maximum at 586 nm, 
however it does not reproduce in the spectrum of  n ′′ . This is 
mainly because the reflection at the interface between air and 
the  metamaterial  hinders  the  electromagnetic  radiation  from 
entering the metamaterial at longer wavelengths and therefore 
the effective absorption of radiation inside the metamaterial is 
low for longer wavelengths. Still, it accounts for almost 90% 
of the losses in the range of the “reflectance window” at 584 
nm.  In  summary  of  this  section,  we  have  shown  that  a 
metamaterial consisting of pairs of silver strips as depicted in 
Fig. 8a can form an almost impedance matched negative index 
material  for  visible  light.  The  transmission  is  limited  to  50% 
almost solely due to absorption, while reflection losses play a 
minor role. 

V.  GAIN, COMPENSATING FOR LOSSES  

It  has  recently  been  pointed  out,  that  energy  can  be 
transferred  from  gain  material  to  surface  plasmon  polaritons 
[44-49] or to plasmons in metal nanostructures [50, 51] using 
stimulated  emission.  Specifically,  continuous  thin  films  of 
metal were used to confine lasing modes in quantum cascade 
lasers to the gain region and also to guide the lasing modes by 
surface  plasmon  modes  [44,  45].  Ramakrishna  and  Pendry 
suggested to staple gain materials such as semiconductor laser 
materials  in  between  the  negative  index  (or  metal)  layers  of 
stacked  near-field  lenses  [52]  in  order  to  remove  absorption 
and  improve  resolution.  The  requirement  of  a  perfect  near-
field  lens,  where  thin  layers  of  positive  and  negative  index 
ε= −  and simultaneously 
ε
materials are alternated is, that  P

constants.  Fig.  8b  shows  the  real  parts  of  the  permittivity 
(triangles)  and  of  the  permeability  (squares).  It  is  seen  that 
both are negative at wavelengths between 580 and 590 nm.  

The  spectra  of  the  reflectance,  transmission,  absorption, 
refractive index, and impedance are displayed in Fig. 9. It can

[56] and therefore the concentration of excited dye molecules 
should be 170 mM. Alternatively, semiconductor nanocrystals 
(NC) such as CdSe NCs could be applied. It has been shown 
in [57] that the absorption cross section per NC volume can be 
10 cm . Because  g  and  α  are usually of similar 
as large as

magnitude,  we  conclude,  that  densely  packed  nanocrystal 
films can show gain in the order of

In  our  discussion  we  would  like  to  turn  to  the  refractive 
index  rather  than  the  permittivity  and  the  permeability, 
because  the  absorption  ( α )  and  gain  ( g )  coefficients  are 
more  straightforwardly  connected  to  the  refractive  index:

positive  index  materials  we  propose  to  “submerge”  the 
negative  index  structures  (containing  e.g.  metal  nanorods)  in 
the gain media as shown in Fig. 10. For example, this could be 
achieved by spin coating a solution of laser dye molecules or 
π-conjugated  molecules  on 
index 
structures.  Applying  semiconductor  nanocrystals  could  be  an 
alternative approach.

One  might  question  whether  the  metal  nanostructures 
nullify  any  attempt  to  amplify  electromagnetic  fields  using 
gain  materials 
their  close  vicinity  because  gold 
nanoparticles  are  well  known  to  quench  fluorescence  in  an 
extremely  efficient  manner  [53,  54].  In  contrast,  however, 
working  solid  state  and  organic  semiconductor  lasers  show 
that  sufficient  gain  can  be  provided  so  that  in  devices 
containing  metal  layers  or  metal  nanoparticles  the  losses  can 
be  compensated.  For  instance,  it was shown  that an optically 
pumped  organic 
laser  comprising  a  metal-nanoparticle 
distributed  feedback  (DFB)  grating  needs  only  a  marginally 
increased pumping threshold (compared to organic lasers with 
metal-free  DFB  gratings)  to  be  operative  [55].  In  the  case  of 
infrared  quantum  cascade  lasers  (QCL),  a  wave  guiding 
metallic layer was shown to be beneficial for the laser power 
output  [45].  This  astonishing  result  is  due  to  an  increased 
overlap  of  the  surface  plasmon  guided  mode  profile  with  the 
gain region (the quantum cascade structure, in this case). This 
overlap offsets the increased losses (compared to a metal-free 
QCL)  resulting  from  surface  plasmon  excitation.  The  net 
effect is an overall improved laser performance. We therefore 
conclude that it should indeed be feasible to use gain materials 
in  order  to  compensate  for  the  losses  introduced  by  the 
resonant  plasmonic  metal  nanoparticles  in  negative  index 
metamaterials.  

We  want  to  give  a  specific  example  on  the  basis  of  the 
sample  shown  in  Figs.  8  and  9.  For  the  moment,  we  assume 
that the metal strips are submerged in a 200 nm thick layer of 
gain  material  (Fig.  10).  We  further  assume  that  the  gain 
material and the metal strips do not influence each other. This 
is an assumption  that certainly needs to be discussed, but for 
the  moment  we  shall  assume  that  the  gain  of  the  material  is 
not influenced by the metal strips. At the wavelength of least 
),  the 
reflectance  (due  to  impedance  matching,

strip material shows an absorption of approximately 45% (Fig. 
9a).  Applying  Lambert-Beer’s  law  and  assuming  that  the 
absorptive  loss  should  be  fully  compensated  by  the  400  nm 
thick gain layer, it turns out that a gain of

It is seen that the dye or nanocrystal concentrations need to 
be quite high to compensate for the losses. However, we have 
assumed in our rough estimation that the gain of the material 
in between the metal strips is not affected by the local fields in 
the  vicinity  of  these  metal  strips.  These  fields  can  be  quite 
high  due  to  nano-plasmonic  resonances.  In  fact,  it  has  been 
pointed  out  by  Kim  et  al.  [58]  and  by  Lawandy  [51]  that  a 
gain medium and localized plasmonic resonances may lead to 
extremely  high  effective  polarizabilities  of  the  combined 
system.  Therefore,  the  possibility  may  arise  that  each  pair  of 
gold nanorods as shown in Fig. 2, or each pair of strips as in 
Fig.  8  shows  a  much  larger  response  to  an  incoming  electric 
field as the same metal structure without gain.

In the example given above we have neglected that the gain 
material is in intimate contact with the silver strips. In order to 
get  a  better  picture,  we  applied  FEMFD  simulations  on  the 
following  model  (Fig.  11a):  We  took  the  same  structure  as 
shown in figure 8, but now we filled the gaps in-between the 
double  silver  strips  with  a  material  that  provides  a  fixed 
. Fig. 11b-d show 
amount of gain between  0  and 
the  transmittance  (T ),  reflectance  ( R ),  refractive  index  ( n′  
and  n′′ )  and  impedance  ( Z ′   and  Z ′′ )  as  a  function  of  gain 
( g ). We found that with a gain of 
 the structure 
becomes  transparent  (Fig.  11b),  while  the  real  part  of  the 
refractive  index  n′   is  almost unaffected by  the  gain material 
(Fig.  11c).  Further  more,  the  impedance  which  was  already 
matched quite well without the gain medium (Fig. 9) improves 
Z ′′ ≈   for

Actually,  if  a  critical  magnitude  of  gain  is  surpassed,  the 
polarizability  and  the  field  enhancement  do  not  depend  on 
nanoparticle  shape  or  material  any  longer,  but  are  solely 
limited by gain saturation in the gain medium [51]. At present, 
we have not included gain saturation in our model. It could be 
envisioned,  that  the  gain  material  does  not  “simply”  restore 
energy,  which  is  lost  due  to  absorption  by  the  metal 
nanostructures, but it becomes an instrumental element of the 
negative  index  material,  e.g.  heavily  increasing  the  negative 
response  of  the  pairs  of  nanorods  [51].  This  will  allow  the 
design  of  negative  index  materials  of  less  overall  metal 
content.  The  density  of  pairs  of  rods  may  be  reduced,  or  the 
size  of  each  pair  may  be  reduced,  while  the  overall  effective 
negative  response  of  the  metamaterial  remains  strong.  This 
exciting  field  certainly  needs  more  consideration,  which  will 
be given elsewhere.

VI.  CONCLUSION 

Very recently, metamaterials have been designed that show 
a  negative  real  part  of  the  refractive  index  at  the  telecom 
wavelength  of 1500 nm or 200 THz. Keeping in mind that it 
only  took  5  years  to  come  from  10  GHz  up  to  200  THz,  we

have  no  doubt  that  a  negative  refractive  index  metamaterial 
will  be  soon  available  also  for  the  visible  range.  We  have 
shown  in  numerical  simulations  that  two  key  remedies  are 
now available to overcome major obstacles that currently limit 
the  development  of  optical  negative-index  materials  (i) 
impedance  matching  designs  are  capable  to  suppress  high 
reflectance,  and  (ii)  gain  materials  embedded  in  metallic 
nanostructures  can  fully  compensate  for  absorptive  losses 
while still retaining the negative refractive index.

Abstract.  Starting  with  a  thought  experiment  proposed  by  Kard10,  which  derives  the 
formula that accounts for the relativistic effect of length contraction, we present a “two 
line”  transparent  derivation  of  the  Lorentz-Einstein  transformations  for  the  space-time 
coordinates  of  the  same  event.  Our  derivation  make  uses  of  Einstein’s  clock 
synchronization procedure. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
Authors make a merit of the fact that they derive the basic formulas of 
special relativity without using the Lorentz-Einstein transformations (LET). 
Thought  experiments  play  an  important  part  in  their  derivations.  Some  of 
these  approaches  are  devoted  to  the  derivation  of  a  given  formula  whereas 
others  present  a  chain  of  derivations  for  the  formulas  of  relativistic 
kinematics in a given succession. Two anthological papers1,2 present a “two 
line”  derivation  of  the  formula  that  accounts  for  the  time  dilation  using  as 
relativistic ingredients the invariant and finite light speed in free space c and 
the  invariance  of  distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of 
relative  motion  of  the  inertial  reference  frame  from  where  the  same  “light 
clock” is observed. Many textbooks present a more elaborated derivation of 
the  time  dilation  formula  using  a  light  clock  that  consists  of  two  parallel 
mirrors located at a given distance apart from each other and a light signal 
that bounces between when observing it from two inertial reference frames 
in relative motion.3,4 The derivation of the time dilation formula is intimately 
related  to  the  formula  that  accounts  for  the  length  contraction  derived  also 
without  using  the  LET.  The  addition  law  for  relativistic  velocities  can  be 
derived without using the LET by using the formulas that account for time 
dilation and length contraction5,6, from the invariance of c7 or using the time 
dilation  formula8.  The  scenarios  following  the  derivation  involve  races 
between  light  signals  and  tardyons,  presenting  many  turning  points  that 
make them hard to teach without mnemonic aids. 
  
Formulas that account for relativistic effects are derived without using 
(LET) in the following succession: radar echo, time dilation, Doppler Effect, 
addition  of  relativistic  velocities9  or  in  the  alternative  succession:  length 
contraction,  Doppler  Effect,  addition  of  relativistic  velocities  and  time

dilation10.  The  striking  fact  is  that  some  of  the  formulas  derived  without 
using  the  LET  can  be  used  to  straightforwardly  derive  the  LET  without 
loosing in transparence. Authors9,11 consider that the derivation of relativistic 
formulas  using  the  LET  is  straightforward  but  rather  formal  and  not  very 
transparent from the point of view of physics. We consider that the LET are 
not  only  straightforward  but  also  transparent  when  we  have  a  correct 
representation  about  the  physical  meaning  of  the  physical  quantities 
involved by these transformations. 
 
 

2.  Length contraction without LET 

2,0L

 
The  derivation  of  the  fundamental  formulas  of  special  relativity 
teaches  us  that  they  are  a  direct  consequence  of  the  fact  that  the  light 
propagates with finite and invariant speed throughout the empty space. The 
way  in  which  Kard10  derives  the  formula  that  accounts  for  the  length 
contraction  leads  to  a  “two  line”  derivation  of  the  LET  for  the  space-time 
coordinates  of  the  same  event.  It  proceeds  as  follows:  consider  a  pair  of 
parallel  rods  in  relative  motion  1  and  2  (Figure  1).  Measured  by  observers 
relative to whom the rods are in a state of rest their (proper) lengths are 
 
1,0L
 respectively. Rod 1 moves with speed V relative to rod 2 whereas 
and 
rod 2 moves with speed –V relative to rod 1. The two rods are positioned 
along the overlapped axes OX(O’X’) of their rest frames  K(XOY) for rod 
2 and K’(X’O’Y’) for rod 1. The corresponding axes of the two frames are 
parallel  to  each  other.  The  diagram  shown  in  Figure  1  is  a  space-diagram 
reflecting  the  point  of  view  of  observers  at  rest  in  K.  Therefore  L
0,2 
represents  in  true  value  the  length  of  the  stationary  rod  whereas  L1(V) 
represents  the  length  of  the  moving  rod  when  measured  by  observers  from 
K.  At  a  time  t=0    the  left  ends  of  both  rods  are  located  at  the  coinciding 
origins O and O’ of the reference frames. At this very moment a source of 
light  S  located  at  O  emits  a  light  signal  in  the  positive  direction  of  the 
common  axes.  Consider  the  new  situation  occurring  after  a  given  time  of 
motion  when  the  right  ends  of  both  rods  coincide  in  space.  We  have

3.  Events  and  their  space-time  coordinates  related  by  the  Lorentz-
Einstein transformations 

 
The  concept  of  event  is  fundamental  in  the  special  relativity  theory 
being defined as “any physical occurrence that happens at a definite place in 
space and at a defined instant in time”. The point where the event takes place 
is defined by its space coordinates with respect to a reference frame say K. 
The concept of rod length is intimately associated with the space coordinates 
that define the location of its ends. Consider a rod located along the OX axis. 
Its ends are 1(x1,0) and 2(x2,0) its length being defined by

to the second one. When 
front  of  it  emits  a  light  signal  in  the  positive  direction  of  the  OX  axis. 
Arriving at the location of the second clock the light signal starts it and from 
this  very  moment  the  two  clocks  display  the  same  running  time  being 
synchronized  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  proposed  by  Einstein.  An 
identical  procedure  synchronizes  the  clocks 
  of  the  K 
frame. 
Figure 3 shows the relative position of the reference frames K and K’ 
 
when  the  right  ends  of  rods  1  and  2  coincide  in  space  as  detected  from  K 
whereas  Figure  4  shows  the  same  situation  as  detected  from  the  reference 
frame K’. In the case shown in Figure 3 clocks 
read 
both  t  as  a  result  of  the  fact  that  the  light  signal  emitted  by  the  source  S

involved  in  the  Kard
emitted  at  t=0.  During  the  time  interval  (t-0)  the  origin  O’  has  advanced 
with V(t-0). The rod 1 is at rest in K’ with its left end at O’, its rest length

The  space  coincidence  of  the  right  ends  of  the  rods  generates  an  event. 
Detected from K this event is characterized by its space coordinates (x,y=0) 
and by its time coordinate t that equates the reading of clock 
 located 
at  the  point  where  the  event  takes  place  when  it  takes  place.  The  notation

 defining the point where it 
takes  place,  whereas  t   equates  the  reading  of  clock 
  located  at  this 
point when the event takes place. Because events the E and E’ take place at 
the same point in space when the clocks C and C’ read t and t’ respectively, 
the relativists say that they represent the same event. 
Equations  (12),  (13),  (10)  and  (14)  represent  the  celebrated  LET  for 
 
the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event  detected  from  two  inertial 
reference frames being in relative motion with speed V. 
Knowing the physics behind the Lorentz-Einstein transformations and 
 
having a correct representation about the meaning of the physical quantities 
they  relate,  we  can  use  them  for  deriving  formulas  that  account  for  the 
fundamental relativistic effects without obscuring the physics behind them. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
 
 
Starting with a thought experiment proposed by Kard10, which derives 
 
the  formula  that  accounts  for  the  relativistic  effect  of  length  contraction 
without using the LET, we have included the distant clock synchronization 
procedure proposed by Einstein thereby obtaining a simple and transparent 
derivation for the LET.

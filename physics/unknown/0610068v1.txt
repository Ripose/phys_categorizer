Abstract:  Analytical  solution  for  optical  trapping  force  on  a  spherical 
dielectric particle for an arbitrary positioned focused beam is presented in a 
generalized  Lorenz-Mie  and  vectorial  diffraction  theory.  In  this  case  the 
exact  electromagnetic  field  is  considered  in  the  focal  region.  A  double 
tweezers setup was employed to perform ultra sensitive force spectroscopy 
and  observe  the  forces,  demonstrating  the  selectively  couple  of  the 
transverse electric (TE), transverse magnetic (TM) modes by means of the 
beam  polarization  and  positioning,  and 
to  observe  correspondent 
morphology-dependent resonances (MDR) as a change in the optical force. 
The  theoretical  prediction  of  the  theory  agrees  well  with  the  experimental 
results. The algorithm presented here can be easily extended to other beam 
geometries and scattering particles.

1. Introduction 

One very important contribution of the optical tweezers technique is its ability to extract the 
missing  mechanical  measurements  in  the  world  of  microorganisms  and  cells  that  could  be 
correlated  to  biochemical  information.  A  microsphere  displacement  is  the  preferential  force 
transducer  for  this  kind  of  measurement  [1].  Geometrical  optics  has  been  used  when  the 
particle dimensions are much greater than the light wavelength and Rayleigh scattering theory 
for the opposite. However, these approximations are no longer valid for the typical conditions 
used  in  optical  tweezers  with  very  high  numerical  aperture  beams  and  microspheres  with 
diameters up to ten wavelengths. These conditions require a full vectorial description of the 

incident  beam  in  partial  waves  with  the  origin  of  coordinate  system  at  the  center  of  the 
microsphere  and  not  at  the  focus  of  the  beam.  All  sorts  of  approximations  and  tricks  have 
been  used  to proceed forward  to  obtain  numerical  results.  Most of  the  trapping  experiments 
are performed at the intermediate size regime, between optical geometric and Rayleigh, where 
diffraction effects are significant. This article presents a theoretical model for different beam 
configurations,  considering  diffraction,  of  a  single  highly  focused  beam  with  arbitrary 
polarization and focus position with respect to the center of microspheres of any size, together 
with experimental results to validate the theory.  

We have shown that a double optical tweezers can be used to perform an ultrasensitive force 
spectroscopy by observing forces due to the light scattering and selectively coupling the light 
to either the TE, the TM or both TE and TM microsphere modes in a single isolated particle as 
function of the beam polarization and position [6,7]. Our results showed how careful one has 
to  be  when  using  optical  force  models  for  mechanical  properties  measurements.  The 
microsphere modes can change the force values by more than 30-50 %. Also it clearly shows 
how the usually assumed azimuthal symmetry in the horizontal plane no longer holds because 
the beam polarization breaks this symmetry. In this article we continue the investigation of the 
forces  in  an  optical  tweezers  by  using  this  ultrasensitive  experimental  technique  to  measure 
whole  optical  force  curves  as  a  function  of  the  3D  beam  position  and  polarization.  To  test 
optical trapping models it is more important to obtain a full trapping force curve as a function 
of  position  instead  of  just  a  few  points.  The  observation  of  diffraction  effects  and 
morphology-dependent  resonance  (MDR)  modes  (by  selectively  coupling  the  light  to  the 
transverse  electric,  transverse  magnetic  modes  in  microsphere  particles)  is  a  clear 
demonstration of the validity of our theory. 

2. Theory 

To  determine  the  optical  forces  rigorously  on  a  dielectric  sphere  of  an  arbitrary  size,  the 
electromagnetic (EM) equations must be solved for the appropriate boundary conditions. The 
main effort in the last few years is to have a proper description of the incident EM fields in a 
highly focused system. This is treated in more detail in a recent publication [2], with a use of a 
special  integral  [3],  in  terms  of  partial  wave  expansion  coefficients,  or  beam  shape 
coefficients (BSC), and can be readily applied to Eq. (1). This special integral has been later 
identified as a special case of the Gegenbauer finite integral. Thus the highly inhomogeneous 
electric field polarizations generated by a tightly focused arbitrary beam is taken into account 
by the BSC. The beam focus is generally no longer at the origin of the coordinate system, so 
all of the beam azimuthal symmetry is lost, this important fact is also taken into account. In 
this theory the electromagnetic field in an optical trap uses a paraxial Gaussian beam before 
the  objective  lens  (fulfilling  the  sine  condition)  and  applying  the  Angular  Spectrum 
Representation which describes correctly the electromagnetic fields and polarization of a high 
numerical aperture (NA) objective [2].

one obtains the generalized Lorenz-Mie coefficients in terms of the parameters that depend on

for  the  optical  force  resonance  condition,  when  the  denominator  for  each  TM  or  TE  wave

To  determine  the  time  averaged  EM  force  on  a  dielectric  sphere  we  proceed  by 
integrating the Minkowski form Maxwell stress tensor over the surface of a sphere in the far 
field [4]:

3. Materials and methods 
We  performed  the  force  spectroscopy  experiment  trapping  a  3,  6  and  9  μm  polystyrene 
microsphere diluted in water with a double optical tweezers setup. One beam from a Nd:YAG 
continuous-wave laser (cw), denoted as a trapping beam, is used to keep the particle trapped, 
while  a  second  beam  from  a  tunable  Ti:Sapphire  cw  laser, which  is  modulated  (10  Hz)  and 
highly  attenuated,  denoted  as  a  perturbing  beam,  is  used  to  perturb  the  particle  from  its 
equilibrium  position.  Both  beams  are  Gaussian  TEM00  laser  beam  brought  to  diffraction 
limited focal spot with a large NA microscope objective (1.25NA 100x oil). We used the same 
oil  immersion  objective  lens  for  focusing  the  trapping  beam,  the  perturbing  beam,  viewing 
and collecting the backscattered light. This setup allowed the observation of the optical forces 
in the axial and radial directions for arbitrary polarization, and the MDR resonances of the TE 
and  TM  modes  of  the  microsphere  by  the  selective  coupling  the  beam  to  any  one  of  the 
modes. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of the optical tweezers configuration used in this 
work.

Fig. 1. Complete scheme for the double optical tweezers for ultra-sensitive force spectroscopy. 

The Gimbal  mount changes the angle of incidence at the back aperture of the objective 
lens, moving the incident beam focus position laterally (radialy), while the telescope changes 
the  focus  depth.  A  lens  system  guarantees  that  the  steered  beam  is  pivoted  on  the  objective 
aperture to avoid power loss. The power transmitted through the objective, measured with an 
integration sphere as a function of the radial and axial position, was constant. The calibration 
of  the  radial  beam  position  was  performed  by  moving  a  calibrated  mark  on  the  Neubauer 
chamber with the microscope translating stage and using the steering mechanism to positioned 
the laser beam at the mark, creating a direct correspondence between position and the beam 
steering step counts. The axial direction calibration procedure is more complicated due to the 
low  axial  spatial  resolution.  For  the  axial  calibration,  we  attached  a  half  a  micron  wide 
fluorescent microsphere to the surface of the Neubauer chamber. With the Ti:Sapphire laser in 
the femtosecond mode, we moved the microscope stage in the z-direction until a two photon 
fluorescence maximum intensity was detected with a PMT for several z position step counts 
of  the  axial  steering  mechanism.  This  way  the  lateral  (radial)  and  axial  steering  step  counts 
can be directly translated in terms of position in microns.  

To measure the radial optical force on the microsphere as a function of beam position, the 
microsphere was held in place by the trapping beam while the perturbing beam was moved in 
the radial direction by using the gimbal mount. The same procedure was adopted for the axial 
force but moving the first telescope lens instead of the gimbal mount.  

A signal proportional to the displacement was measured using the backscattering of a He-
Ne  laser  after  passing  through  two  short  pass  filters  to  reject  the  Nd:YAG  and  Ti:Sapphire 
laser beams, and detected with a photomultiplier tube (PMT) coupled to the eyepiece of the 
microscope and a lock-in amplifier. The axial and radial forces were observed by monitoring 
the  amplitude  of  the  displacements  while  changing  the  position  of  the  Ti:Sapphire  laser. 
Polarization was controlled by a λ/2 waveplate. 

The MDR were observed by placing the perturbing beam just outside the surface of the 
sphere where coupling was strongest, with this beam in place the wavelength of the perturbing 
beam was incremented by rotating the birefringent plate inside the laser cavity with a rotating 
step motor and calibrated with a monochromator. The fact that the microsphere is suspended 
in  the  fluid  by  the  optical  tweezers  is  very  important  since  any  near  surfaces  will  ruin  the 
boundary conditions. 

4. Results and discussion 

The  microsphere  trapped  by  a  highly  focused  beam  will  experience  a  force  moving  it  to  a 
stationary position on the optical axis, generally just behind the focal point, in relation to the 
propagation  direction.  This  distance  is  determined  by  finding  the  position  where  the  axial 
force  is  zero  by  varying  the  beam  axial  position  only.  Afterwards  we  simulate  the  optical 
forces  in  the  radial  direction  for  different  polarization,  wavelength  and  microsphere  sizes 
using  the  theory  presented  in  Section  2,  the  numerical  convergence  is  determined  by  the 
  [2].  Note  that  all  force 
maximum  angular  momentum  chosen  in  the  expansion, 
components  are  considered  since  as  the  beam  focuses  at  the  edge,  the  contribution  z   force 
component  becomes  more  significant  and  reaches  the  same  order  of  the  x   and  y   force 
components. Here we shall restrict only to the case of radial optical forces, even though this 
theory  applies  to  optical  forces  in  three  dimensions,  the  axial  case  has  some  special 
considerations that will be addressed in a next publication.

For the radial optical forces, Fig.2, diffraction effects can be seen at the end of figure for 
either polarizations and reproduced adequately in the theory. Exact fitting with theory was not 
possible due to unknown exact values of: microsphere size; refractive indexes and beam width 
at objective aperture. These values affect the diffraction rings transmitted to the optical force. 
For MDR, Fig. 3 it can be observed that each beam polarization excited each mode, TM or 
TE, separately as has been demonstrated previously [6]. This can be intuitively understood by 
noticing that only the radial component of the electric field will excite the TM mode, and only 
the  radial  component  of  the magnetic  field  will  excite  the  TE  modes.  It  can  also be noticed

5. Conclusions 

With this formalism, based on the rigorous solutions of Maxwell equations, proper treatment 
of optical forces in OT can now be applied taking into account all electromagnetic effects near 
the  trapped  dielectric  object.  We  emphasize  that  the  integral  (Eq.  (3)  of  Ref.  [2])  was 
fundamental  for  this  development  that  dramatically  simplifies  the  BSC  calculation  for  an 
arbitrary  translation.  We  remark  that  no  assumption  has  been  made  for  the  size  of  the 
scatterer,  thus  making  it  adequate  for  the  most  general  case  of  the  Mie  regime  and  readily 
applicable  (in  the  case  of  optics).  The  optical  forces  are  described  in  terms  of  experimental 
parameters, depending on the beam profile taking into account the filling factor and dielectric 
properties  of  the  medium.  Not  only  should  a  choice  of  wavelength  be  considered  based  on 
damage  to  samples,  but  also  at  resonance  condition  as  to  maximize  optical  force  with 
wavelength, in this way reducing the power (heating) needed.

The  results  confirms 

theoretical  description  obtained  experimentally  also 
demonstrating  how  careful  one  has  to  be  when  using  optical  force  models  for  mechanical 
properties measurements. The framework of the formalism presented here can also be easily 
applied to general beams such as Laguerre beams, laser sheets, doughnut and top-hat beams, 
these  types  of  beams  will  be  deferred  to  a  later  study.  We  have  restricted  ourselves  to  the 
calculation  of  the  radial  force  since  when  considering  the  axial  force  spherical  aberration 
comes into play and this lengthy discussion is considered for a further publication.

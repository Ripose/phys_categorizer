Abstract 

Incorporation mechanisms of H2 in silica glass were studied with Raman and infrared (IR) 
microspectroscopy. Hydrogenated samples were prepared at temperatures between 800°C and 
955°C at 2 kbar total pressure. Hydrogen fugacities (fH2) were controlled using the double 
capsule technique with the iron–wüstite (IW) buffer assemblage generating fH2 of 1290–1370 
bars corresponding to H2 partial pressures (PH2) of 960–975 bars. We found that silica glass 
hydrogenated under such conditions contains molecular hydrogen (H2) in addition to SiH and 
SiOH groups. H2 molecules dissolved in the quenched glasses introduce a band at 4136 cm−1 
in the Raman spectra which in comparison to that of gaseous H2 is wider and is shifted to 
lower frequency. IR spectra of hydrogenated samples contain a band at 4138 cm−1 which we 
assign to the stretching vibration of H2 molecules located in non-centrosymmetric sites. The 
Raman and IR spectra indicate that the dissolved H2 molecules interact with the silicate 
network. We suggest that the H2 band is the envelope of at least three components due to the 
occupation of at least three different interstitial sites by H2 molecules. Both, Raman and IR 
spectra of hydrogenated glasses contain bands at  2255 cm−1 which may be due to the 
vibration of SiH groups. Under the assumption that the reaction Si–O–Si + H2 → Si–H + Si–
O–H describes adequately the ‘chemical dissolution' of H2 molecules, the SiH concentrations 
in our samples were determined and the molar extinction coefficient for the SiH absorption 
band in the infrared ( 2255(SiH)) could then be estimated to be 45 ± 3 l/mol cm. The solubility 
of molecular H2 in our hydrogenated samples was determined using the IR absorption band at 
4138 cm−1 and the extinction coefficient given by Shelby [J. Non-Cryst. Solids 179 (1994) 
138]. Samples quenched with different cooling rates gave nearly identical Raman and IR 
spectra, suggesting that the chemical dissolution of hydrogen (SiH and SiOH) can be 
quenched to room temperature without changing relative concentrations and that no 
exsolution of hydrogen occurred during the quench.  

 

 

 

 

 

1. Introduction 

The incorporation of volatiles such as noble gases, carbon dioxide and water in silica glasses 
and melts has been widely investigated [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] with respect to physical properties 
affected by the presence of the volatiles and their related species in the silicate network (see 
[9] for a recent review of microscopic models for water dissolution). For example, water was 
shown to decrease melting temperatures [2, 10, 11] and viscosities [12], to increase 
devitrification rates [13] and to affect optical properties of vitreous silica [14, 15]. Therefore, 
the dissolution mechanisms of water have been the object of various studies using vibrational 
spectroscopic techniques such as Raman and infrared (IR) spectroscopy (see [16, 17] for 
recent reviews). 

Molecular hydrogen (H2) was also shown to affect the optical properties of silica glass. Faile 
and co-workers [18, 19, 20] showed that hydrogen impregnated silica glasses suppress the 
formation of color centers caused by neutron and gamma irradiation. Dissolution mechanisms 
of H2 in vitreous silica were studied on samples quenched from silica liquids (T > 1750°C) 
molten in presence of H2-containing atmospheres [1, 21], on silica glasses impregnated with 
H2 at temperatures below 225°C and hydrogen pressures ranging from 1 to 860 bars [1, 22, 
23, 24] or on samples hydrogenated at PH2=1 bar and temperatures up to 900°C [25]. These 
studies showed that hydrogen can dissolve ‘physically' as molecular H2 in the interstices of 
the silicate network, but also ‘chemically' due to the dissociation of H2 molecules and the 
formation of hydroxyl groups (OH) and hydrides (SiH). However, SiH and OH groups were 
not always observed in hydrogen treated samples and their formation seems to be correlated 
rather with high temperatures than with high hydrogen pressures prevailing during 
hydrogenation. Most of the studies on hydrogen dissolution mechanisms used Raman or IR 
spectroscopy and these two methods can provide complementary information about different 
H-bearing species dissolved in a glass. To our knowledge, no combined IR and Raman 
spectroscopic studies for hydrogenated silica can be found in the literature. Therefore, the 
comparison of previously published Raman and IR spectra suffers from the fact that the 
spectra were obtained from different silica samples, hydrogenated at different conditions (PH2 
and T). In addition, the spectroscopic studies were often focused on a limited frequency range, 
not covering the entire range in which the signals of SiH, OH and H2 can be observed (2000–
4200 cm−1). 

The aim of this study is to provide information about the incorporation mechanisms of 
molecular H2 in silica glass hydrogenated at temperatures 800°C and 955°C and H2 pressures, 
960–975 bars. Additionally, experiments with different quench rates have been performed to 
study the possible effects of different cooling rates on hydrogen solubility in vitreous silica. 
Such quench effects were indeed observed for the water speciation in hydrous silicate glasses 
[26], in which the ratio of structurally bonded OH groups and molecular water decreases with 
decreasing quench rates of the samples. Hydrogenated silica glasses for our study were 
prepared using the double capsule technique of Eugster [27] and the iron–wüstite–H2O (IW) 
oxygen buffer assemblage to control fH2 during the experiments. Both, Raman and IR 
spectroscopy were used for the investigations of our samples providing qualitative and 
quantitative information about hydrogen solubility in silica glass. 

 

 

2. Experimental procedures 

2.1. Starting materials 

The starting glass for the hydrogenation experiments was a bubble free specimen of Quartzil 
C (Metaceram – Quartex company, Villejuif, France). Its water content was determined from 
IR band heights of the fundamental OH-stretching band around 3673 cm−1 using the modified 
law of Bouguer–Lambert–Beer [28]: 

 

where c is the concentration expressed as weight fraction, mw is the molecular weight of the 
absorbing species, A is the absorbance expressed as peak height, d is the sample thickness 
(cm), ρ is the sample density (g/l) and 
is the molar extinction coefficient (l/mol cm). Under 
the assumption that at very low water content (<0.2 wt%) only O–H vibrations of structurally 
bonded hydroxyl groups (SiOH) contribute to this absorption band and using the molar 
extinction coefficient published in [17] ( 3673(OH)=77.5 l/mol cm) the OH content was 
determined to be 192 ± 10 ppm (in wt% OH). 

The metallic iron of the buffer assemblage controlling fH2 was a commercial product (Merck 
LAB) and ‘FeO' was synthesized from Fe3O4 in a fO2-controlled furnace at 1 atm and 1200°C 
(details are given in [29]). 

2.2. Sample preparation 

The starting glasses were cut with a diamond saw into rectangular pieces, typical sizes were 
4 × 1.5 × 1.5 mm. To prevent puncturing the capsule under pressure, the sharp edges of the 
sawn blocks were rounded with a diamond file. After this treatment, the glasses were cleaned 
ultrasonically in acetone and H2O. After drying for several hours at 110°C in air, the glass 
blocks were loaded into Pt or Au capsules (10–15 in mm length; 2.5 mm inner diameter; 0.2 
mm wall thickness) which were welded shut. The glass-containing capsules were placed 
together with the oxygen buffer assemblage into Au capsules (30–40 mm length; 5.0 mm 
inner diameter; 0.4 mm wall thickness) that were also welded at both ends. The solid phases 
of the buffer assemblages consisted always of 99 wt% reduced (Fe) and 1 wt% oxidized 
phases (FeO), the amount of H2O added was always sufficient to oxidize the entire 
assemblage. In one case the H2O of the buffer assemblage was replaced by D2O to obtain 
further spectroscopic information about the incorporation mechanism of hydrogen into the 
silica glass. The sealed capsules were tested for leakage by weighing before and after heating 
at 110°C for 15–30 min. 

Hydrogen fugacities imposed by the buffer assemblages were calculated from oxygen 
fugacities obtained from O'Neill and Pownceby [30] assuming ideal mixing of real gases 
(Lewis–Randall rule) in the H2O–H2 fluid mixture of the buffer assemblage (Table 1). A more 
detailed description and discussion of the applied calculations is given in [29]. Buffer masses 
to be used for a given experimental conditions were calculated on the basis of the fH2 imposed 
by the buffer assemblage and the theoretical mass transfer of H2 through the capsule walls 
toward the pressure vessel (Eq. (10) in [31]). Hydrogen permeability constants for noble 
metals and buffer capacities of the oxygen buffer assemblages were taken from [32].

2.3. Apparatus and experimental conditions 

The experiments were performed in an internally heated pressure vessel (IHPV), equipped 
with the fast-quench device of Roux and Lefèvre [33] which was modified for this study. In 
contrast to the original setup the sample capsules were placed in a sample holder (alumina 
tube 50 mm in length, 10 mm inner diameter and 0.6 mm wall thickness); the free volume of 
this tube was filled with silica wool. The sample holder was suspended by a quench wire 
(Kanthal, 0.2 mm diameter), connected to two electrodes. At the end of the experiment the 
electrodes were connected to a variac and the voltage was increased which led to electrical 
fusion of the quench wire and the sample holder dropped into the cold bottom part (T < 50°C) 
of the vessel. The cooling time to room temperature for a quenched sample is estimated to be 
less than 1 min [33] with high quench rates of 100–50°C/s at the beginning and decreasing 
quench rates near the end of the cooling. During the experiment, the suspended sample holder 
was located in the hot spot zone of the furnace, where the thermal gradient could be 
minimized to less than 5°C by adjusting the power supplies of two windings. Temperature 
was recorded by three sheathed chromel–alumel thermocouples, calibrated at 1 atm against 
the melting points of LiCl and NaCl (temperatures are considered to be accurate to ±5°C). 
Pressure was recorded by a transducer, calibrated against a Heise tube gauge (considered to be 
accurate to ±20 bars). 

Hydrogenation experiments were performed at 2 kbar total pressure and 800°C and 955°C 
(Table 1). These temperatures were below the glass transition temperatures Tg (Tg ≈ 1205°C 
[34]), allowing only H2 incorporation mechanisms into glasses (not into liquids) to be studied. 
The experimental conditions were a compromise between the P–T limitations of the 
experimental apparatus and the buffer lifetimes which decrease rapidly with increasing 
temperature. Run duration were 1.5 h after reaching the final P and T for the 955°C 
experiments and 10 h for the 800°C experiments. In most cases quenching was performed 
using the fast quench device described above, but one experiment was quenched at a smaller 
rate by turning off the power while the sample remained in the hot part of the vessel. In this 
case temperature dropped from 800°C to 400°C within 7 min and from 400°C to 100°C 
within 26 min. After quenching only the external capsules were swollen (due to the high PH2 
in the H2O–H2 fluid) but not the sample-containing capsules since no free fluid phase was 
present during the experiments. Buffer assemblages were checked after the experiments for 
the residual phases by weight loss (H2, H2O) and X-ray diffraction (Fe, FeO). After the 955°C 
experiments all phases were present after the quench, demonstrating that the buffer was 
working until the end. After the long duration experiments at 800°C the buffer contained 
mainly FeO indicating that the buffer was consumed before the end of the run. However, the 
external capsules were still swollen which showed that the PH2 at the end of the experiment 

was only slightly below that of the equilibrium value for the IW buffer assemblage. Doubly 
polished sections for the spectroscopic investigations were prepared by cutting the quenched 
samples into plates with a diamond saw and polishing them to sections of 0.5–1.0 mm 
thickness. 

2.4. Analytical techniques 

Infrared absorption spectra were obtained in the spectral range 600–6000 cm−1 using a Fourier 
transform (FT)–IR spectrometer (NicoletTM 710) and an infrared microscope (NicplanTM), 
both purged with dry air. Spectra were obtained using a Globar light source, KBr beamsplitter 
and a MCT (HgCdTe) detector. The microscope was equipped with a cassegrainian objective 
(15×), the analyzed spot had a diameter of 100 μm. The samples were positioned on a NaCl 
disk, the beam was focused into the center of the doubly polished samples. Spectra were 
acquired in 100 scans and 2 cm−1 spectral resolution was consistently chosen. 

Raman spectra were obtained using a petrographic microscope (OlympusTM) attached to a 
confocal micro-Raman spectrometer (DilorTM XY) equipped with a premonochromator and a 
charge-coupled detector (CCD, WrightTM). The samples were excited with the 514 nm 
monochromatic light of an Argon laser (Coherent InnovaTM). The laser power was chosen to 
be 500 mW, the laser beam was focused 30 μm into sample (objective 50×, 8 mm working 
distance), the confocal aperture was opened to 500 μm. Complete spectra were taken with a 
resolution between 2.3 and 1.4 cm−1 (1200 g/mm holographic grating) in the spectral ranges 
235–2300, 1547–3346 and 2764–4331 cm−1. Spectra with higher resolution (0.3–0.55 cm−1; 
1800 g/mm holographic grating) were collected in the spectral ranges of interest. Acquisition 
times ranged from 50 to 600 s. Identical acquisition parameters were used for spectra that 
were to be compared. Polished samples were always used to reduce the experimental error. 
For example, spectra collected from the same sample on different days, but using exactly the 
same operating parameters, were nearly identical with intensity variations of less than 5%. 

3. Results 

The spectroscopic analysis of the quenched glasses was performed as soon as possible after 
synthesis and polishing (delay between experiment and analysis was less than 5 days) because 
of the possible H2 loss from silicate glasses, observed in previous studies. Faile and Roy [20] 
reported that as much as half of the hydrogen initially present in vitreous silica had diffused 
out of the glass after 100 days. We observed a similar loss in which 35% of H2 was lost from 
our samples (polished sections, around 1 × 1.5 × 1.5 mm in size) after 8 weeks. 

Typical Raman spectra obtained from vitreous silica before and after hydrogenation are 
shown in Fig. 1. The higher frequency region (Fig. 1(a)) of the spectrum of the hydrogenated 
sample (Q6-IW) contains a band at 4136 cm−1, which is attributed to the stretching mode of 
molecular H2 dissolved in the glass [21, 22]. At around 3700 cm−1, a band can be detected 
which can be assigned to O–H stretching vibrations of SiOH groups (e.g. [35]). The 
asymmetrical band at 2255 cm−1 (Fig. 1(b)), present in the hydrogenated glass has been 
previously detected in the Raman spectra of H2-bearing silica glass [21] and was attributed to 
Si–H stretching vibrations. The band at 2327 cm−1 (located here on the high frequency tail of 
the SiH band) is attributed to molecular N2 of the air in the laboratory and is present in every 
Raman spectrum, collected in this frequency range. The low frequency region (Fig. 1(c)) of 
our samples changes slightly upon incorporation of H2 and its related species. The ‘defect 
bands' at 600 and 490 cm−1 (attributed to various structural units such as rings of 3- and 4-

membered SiO4-tetrahedra [36], broken Si–O bonds [37] or overcoordinated Si and O [38]) 
decrease in amplitude with the incorporation of hydrogen into the glass. The amplitude 
decrease of the 600 cm−1 band is larger than that of the 490 cm−1 band.  

 

 

Fig. 1. : Raman spectra of a vitreous silica sample before and after hydrogenation or deuteration. The complete 
frequency range investigated (4300–170 cm−1) is divided in three frequency regions: (a) 4300–2800 cm−1, (b) 
3300–1500 cm−1, (c) 1450–170 cm−1. Spectra of the starting sample (Qz(I)) are always plotted below the spectra 
of the deuterated sample (Q5-IW-D2, on top) and the hydrogenated sample (Q6-IW, middle). Spectral changes 
due to H2 or D2 incorporation are indicated with arrows and are discussed in the text. The narrow band at 2327 
cm−1 (b) is assigned to molecular N2 of the laboratory atmosphere and is present in each Raman spectrum 
collected in this frequency region. 

Profiles taken from the centers to the edges of hydrogenated specimen showed no variation in 
the amplitudes of H-related bands in Raman or IR spectra. Fig. 2 shows the infrared spectra in 
the frequency range between 2000 and 5500 cm−1 of the same silica samples presented in Fig. 
1. The spectra (before and after H2 or D2 treatment) are normalized to a sample thickness of 
1.0 mm. IR spectroscopy, which is sensitive to the OH stretching vibration (here around 3673 
cm−1 in Fig. 2(a)), shows that more OH groups are present in the hydrogenated sample than in 

the starting glass (amplitude increase of the 3673 cm−1 band). Although silica glass possesses 
an infrared absorption band at  2252 cm−1, which is not related to the presence of H-bearing 
species (see H–D exchange experiments), the appearance of a second band at 2255 cm−1 was 
observed in the hydrogenous sample (Fig. 2(a)). This band was previously attributed to the 
vibration of SiH groups [19]. The band around 4520 cm−1 is assumed to consist of two 
different contributions: (1) the first SiH overtone (2 × 2255 cm−1) and (2) the SiOH 
combination band (O–H and Si–OH). However, the OH concentration in this glass is less than 
750 ppm and the contribution of the SiOH combination band will be very small compared to 
that of the SiH overtone. The IR spectra of hydrogenated samples show also a band at 4138 
cm−1 attributed to molecular hydrogen [1, 39]. Because of the centrosymmetry of diatomic, 
homonuclear molecules, the vibrations of undisturbed H2 molecules are not IR-active and 
such a band should not be present in the IR spectra. Freund et al. [40] attributed a band at 
4130 cm−1 in the infrared spectra of crystalline CaO, to the H–H stretching mode of H2 
molecules located in non-centrosymmetrical sites. A similar effect may be responsible for the 
H–H vibration band in the IR absorption spectra of our samples, implying that H2 molecules 
are bonded to the silicate framework or are distorted by the asymmetric field within the 
interstices of the silicate network. 
 

 

 

Fig. 2. : (a) IR spectra of a silica sample before (lower spectrum) and after hydrogenation (upper spectrum). For 
comparison both spectra were normalized to the same sample thickness (1.0 mm). Spectral changes after 
hydrogenation are indicated by arrows. The negative absorption doublet around 2350 cm−1 and the background 
scatter around 3750 and 5350 cm−1 are due to molecular CO2 and H2O, respectively, in the laboratory 
atmosphere and are not intrinsic features of the samples. (b) IR spectrum of a deuterated sample (Q5-IW-D2). 
Absorption bands of D-bearing species are indicated with arrows. The SiOD combination band ( 3670 cm−1) is 
a smaller feature and is lost in the background scatter due to atmospheric H2O. 

The assignments of bands to H-bearing species can be verified by the isotopic replacement of 
hydrogen by deuterium. The resulting frequency change in the vibrational spectra follows the 
relation [41] 
 

 
under the assumption, that the force constant of the vibration is unaffected by the substitution. 
In Eq. 2, ν is the vibration frequency, μ the reduced mass (μ=(mamb)/(ma + mb), where ma and 
mb are the masses of the two atoms involved in the vibration) and X=Si, O, H, or D. 

 

The Raman and IR spectra of a deuterated sample are given in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2(b), 
respectively. As predicted, the bands attributed to H–H, O–H and Si–H vibrations are shifted 
to lower frequencies with the substitution of H by D, confirming the band assignments made 
above. However, the calculated frequencies for the vibrations of D-containing species are 
consistently lower (20–50 cm−1) than the observed band positions (Table 2). This shift may be 
due to the expression for the reduced mass in Eq. 2 which is strictly valid only for diatomic 
molecules. However, the H- and D-bearing species dissolved in our samples are either a part 
of the silicate network (SiOH, SiOD, SiH and SiD) or have interactions with it (H2 and D2) 
which may affect the reduced mass of the vibrating groups. Therefore, the expression 
μ=(mamb)/(ma + mb) applied in our calculations may only be an approximation, leading to the 
differences between calculated and observed frequencies (Table 2). Although hydrogen was 
replaced completely by deuterium in all H-bearing species, the IR spectrum of the deuterated 
sample (Fig. 2(b)) contains an absorption band at 2252 cm−1, demonstrating that this band is 
not due to H-bearing species, but is related to the silicate network of the silica sample (the 
background scatter in the frequency regions around 3700 and 5350 cm−1 is due to atmospheric 
H2O and is not related to H2O dissolved in the sample). For the deuterium containing glass, 
the SiD overtone at  3350 cm−1 can be isolated from the SiOD combination band which is 
located at  3670 cm−1. However, in the presented spectrum the latter cannot be resolved from 
the background scatter in this region (due to atmospheric H2O) since the SiOD concentration 
is very low.

4. Discussion 

4.1. Comparison of gaseous H2 versus H2 dissolved in silica glass 

The high frequency Raman spectrum of gaseous H2 (Fig. 3) consists of four narrow Q-branch 
bands (Q1(J) with Δ =1; ΔJ=0; J=0,1,2,3), which are due to vibrational–rotational transitions 
[42]. In the low frequency region (inset Fig. 3), molecular H2 gives rise to four pure rotational 
bands (S0(J) with Δ =0, ΔJ=2, J=0,1,2,3) and their intensities reflect the populations of the 
initial rotational levels. H2 molecules exist in two forms with different nuclear spin states, (1) 
ortho-hydrogen with parallel nuclear spins and (2) para-hydrogen with anti-parallel spins. In 
contrast to para-hydrogen, ortho-hydrogen cannot exist in a state of J=0 and its rotational 
ground state will be J=1. Because of the larger abundance of ortho-hydrogen (normal 
population ratio of ortho- and para-hydrogen: 3:1), the bands which are due to transitions 
involving rotation energy levels with J=1 (Q1(1), S0(1)) have the highest intensity in the 
Raman spectra of gaseous H2 (Fig. 3). In contrast, hydrogen molecules dissolved in our 
samples show in the high frequency region only one band with a larger width and the 
maximum at 4136 cm−1. The rotational fine structure of the (rotational-) vibrational bands 
observed in the spectra of gaseous H2 cannot be resolved in the spectra of dissolved H2 or has 
been lost due to the dissolution process. In the lower frequency region (e.g. Fig. 1(c)), the 

signal of pure rotational transitions (S0(J) in Fig. 3) disappeared with incorporation of H2 into 
the glass. The loss of the rotational structure in the H2 spectrum, the frequency shift of the 
stretching vibration to lower frequency (4136 cm−1 in comparison to the Q1(1) frequency of 
4155 cm−1 of gaseous H2 at 1 atm [42]), and the bandwidth increase can be assigned to 
interactions between the dissolved H2 molecules and the surrounding atoms of the silicate 
network. However, this interaction can be only very weak since H2 molecules diffused out of 
the hydrogenated samples while stored at room temperature.  

 

Fig. 3. : Raman spectrum of gaseous H2 trapped in a fluid inclusion with the typical Q-branch bands (Q1(J)) of 
rotational–vibrational transitions in the frequency range 4160–4120 cm−1. The inset shows the pure rotational 
bands (S0(J)) of gaseous H2, located in the low frequency region of the Raman spectrum. 

The presence of the H2 band in the infrared spectra of hydrogenous silica samples indicates a 
perturbation in the symmetric distribution of the electron density of the H2 molecules under 
the affects of the surrounding silicate network. The shapes of the H2 stretching bands are 
nearly similar in the Raman and IR spectra (Fig. 4), suggesting that all dissolved H2 molecules 
are equally perturbed, i.e. they possess a similar deviation from centrosymmetry. The shape of 
the H2 band in the spectra of our samples is distinctively asymmetric with a steeper tail at the 
low frequency side and a small shoulder at around 4110 cm−1. We suggest that this 
asymmetrical shape shows that the H2 band is the envelope of at least three bands implying 
the occupation of different interstitial sites with different H2–silicate network interactions. 
Another explanation for the asymmetrical shape of the H2 band could be, that this band is the 
envelope of the enlarged and frequency decreased Q-branch bands of gaseous H2. However, it 
was impossible to fit this band with four components possessing the properties of the Q-
branch bands (relative frequencies, peak heights and widths). In addition, the Raman and IR 
spectroscopic study of hydrogenated silicate glasses ranging in composition from SiO2 to 
NaAlSi3O8 [43] showed systematic changes in the shape of the H2 bands along that join, but 
also between the Raman and IR bands of the intermediate compositions, supporting the 
suggestion that different interstices are occupied by the dissolved H2 molecules.

sample Q6-IW. Both spectra are baseline corrected and are normalized to the same peak height. 

In the hydrogenated silica samples IR and Raman bands attributed to SiH and OH groups 
have been observed. These structural units result, most probably, from the ‘chemical' 
dissolution of H2 according to the reaction 

 

Si−−O−−Si+H2  Si−−O−−H+Si−−H, 

 
 
proposed by van der Steen and van den Boom [21]. Shelby [1] has shown that the fractions of 
hydroxyl and hydride removed from hydrogenated silica during a heat treatment are identical, 
indicating that SiOH and SiH are most probably formed according reaction (3). The formation 
of SiH and SiOH groups is probably linked to the presence of certain structural units in the 
silicate network. Similar to the incorporation of water in fused silica [44], the incorporation of 
hydrogen or deuterium into silica glass led to the intensity decrease of the ‘defect bands' at 
600 and 490 cm−1 in the Raman spectra (Fig. 1(c)). These bands were assigned to different 
structural units [36, 37, 38] but the assignments are still under debate. However, we suggest 
that the Raman spectra show that the first Si–O–Si bonds that break due to H2 incorporation 
are probably located in the structural units represented by these defect bands. Therefore, the 
formation of SiH and OH may depend on the type of glass and its thermal history. 

4.2. Possible quench effects on H2 solubility 

An important problem when studying solubility mechanisms of volatiles in silicate systems at 
elevated pressure and temperature by investigation of the quench products is whether or not 
the equilibrium species at experimental conditions can be quenched to room temperature. In 
other words, do the volatiles observed in the glass at room temperature provide information 
about the volatile species dissolved in the glass or liquid at higher P and T? 

To obtain information about possible quench effects on the H-speciation of hydrogenous 
glasses, experiments with different quench rates have been performed (Q3-IW, rapid quench: 
800 → 50°C in <1 min; Q2-IW, slow quench: 800 → 100°C in 33 min). Although the buffer 
might have been consumed in these two experiments, information on the effects of different 
cooling rates can be obtained. Both double capsules were prepared identically and contained 

the same amounts of the buffer assemblage, assuming that the ‘PH2-history' of both samples 
was the same. The IR and Raman spectra of both samples (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6) were identical 
with respect to all observed H-bearing species (H2, OH and SiH), suggesting that neither, 
physical dissolution (H2 molecules) nor chemical dissolution of H2 (SiH and OH groups) is 
affected by quench rates or that the equilibrium species in the silicate melt change so rapidly, 
that it cannot be detected in our experiments. The interactions of dissolved H2 molecules with 
the surrounding network seem to be indeed temperature dependent. The diffusive mobility of 
H2 in silicate liquids melts and glasses at high temperatures [45] suggests that these 
interactions are much weaker at these temperatures than those observed at room temperature. 
This difference is also indicated by the in situ Raman spectra of hydrogenated silica and 
aluminosilicate glasses [23, 43] where a shift of the H2 band position towards higher 
frequency and a change of the bandwidth was observed with increasing temperature. The 
identical line shapes of the H2 bands in the Raman spectra of glasses quenched with different 
quench rates is therefore the basis for suggesting that the interactions of H2 molecules with the 
silicate network cannot be quenched to room temperature.

rates. The two upper spectra show the IR spectra of Q3-IW (rapid quench) and Q2-IW (slow quench), 
normalized to a sample thickness of 1.0 mm. The lower spectrum shows the difference spectrum (Q3-IW–Q2-
IW). No quench effects on the IR bands of H-bearing species in hydrogenated samples (H2, OH, SiH) were 
observed. The weak negative peaks around 3675 and 2255 cm−1 in the difference spectra are assumed to result 
from non-perfect thickness normalization. The two narrow bands around 2900 cm−1 (Q3-IW and difference 
spectra) result from residual organic material used in the preparation of the sample for the spectroscopic 
investigations. 

 

Fig. 6. : Raman spectra of samples hydrogenated at 2 kbar, 800°C, IW buffer and quenched with different 
cooling rates. The two upper spectra show the IR spectra of Q3-IW (rapid quench) and Q2-IW (slow quench). 
The lower spectrum shows the difference spectrum (Q3-IW–Q2-IW). No quench effect on the H2 peaks assigned 
to the H–H stretching vibration in the Raman spectra of hydrogenated samples was observed. 

Another possible problem which can occur during quenching of volatile-bearing systems from 
high P and T is the exsolution of volatile species. However, profiles collected at room 
temperature from the edges to the centers of hydrogenated silica glass blocks showed no 
variation of the amounts of H-bearing species. In addition, scanning electron microscope 
analysis did not detect submicroscopic bubbles or cracks which could be formed during 
cooling, nor was a gas phase observed in the capsules after quenching indicating that none or 
very little H2 exsolution occurred during the quench. Furthermore, the spectroscopic 
investigations showed only the signals of H2 without rotational freedom but no signals of H2 
molecules that could be present in liquid-like pools. 

Possible problems for quenching SiOH and SiH may also occur. Variations of the proportions 
of molecular water and hydroxyl as a function of the quench rate have indeed been observed 
in hydrous aluminosilicate glasses [26]. Analogous to the incorporation of water, the 
formation of SiOH and SiH groups due to H2 incorporation involves bond breaking and 
reorganization of the silicate network. This process should be more sluggish than changes in 
the interaction of H2 molecules with the silicate network and it should be possible to observe 
it with quench rate dependent experiments. Since we do not observe variations of the relative 
amounts of H2, SiOH and SiH groups as a function of quench rates, we conclude that the 
species resulting from chemical dissolution of H2 could be quenched to room temperature. 
However, it is worth noting that our hydrogenation experiments were conducted on glasses at 
temperature <Tg and that experiments performed at liquidus conditions may have different 
results. 

4.3. Quantitative determination of SiH and H2 

According to reaction (3), the formation of SiH groups is coupled with the formation of equal 
amounts of OH groups. If the concentrations of OH groups before and after hydrogenation are 
known (e.g. by determination with IR spectroscopy), the concentration of SiH groups can be 
calculated and the extinction coefficient ( 2255(SiH)) for the IR SiH-band at 2255 cm−1 can be 
determined. However, other reactions between silica and hydrogen can also produce hydroxyl 

and hydride. For example, reactions of H2 with defects in the silicate network like non-
bridging oxygen atoms or oxygen vacancies can result in formation of OH or SiH. Also water 
trapped in the sample capsule (in form of surface adsorbed water on the samples, atmospheric 
water or H2O formed from oxygen containing gases during the reducing conditions of our 
experiments) can dissolve as hydroxyl groups in the samples at our experimental conditions. 
To use reaction (3) for the determination of  2255(SiH) it must be shown that this reaction was 
the dominant process for the formation of SiH and OH groups in our hydrogenated samples. 
This demonstration can be done by showing the proportionality between SiH and OH and 
requires samples with different amounts of hydroxyl and hydride. Such samples can be 
obtained from synthesis at different H2 pressures or by removing some of the hydroxyl and 
hydride from a hydrogenated sample by a heat treatment. We heated a doubly polished section 
of sample Q6-IW for 3 h at 900°C in air and measured IR spectra in intervals of 5–60 min in 
order to determine the SiH and OH removal from the sample. Absorbances of the bands at 
3673 cm−1 (OH) and  2255 cm−1 (SiH) were measured from difference spectra, obtained by 
subtraction of the starting glass spectrum from that of a hydrogenated sample (both spectra 
normalized to the same sample thickness). Therefore, these spectra are due to either the 
changes due to hydrogenation (unheated samples) or the changes due to hydrogenation and 
following heat treatment. The concentration of the ‘additional' OH groups 
(ΔcOH=cOH(hydrogenated sample)  − cOH(starting glass)) was calculated from heights of the 
3673 cm−1 IR absorption band using the extinction coefficient  3673(OH)=77.5 l/mol cm [17] 
and the density of 2,200 g/cm3 for vitreous silica. Fig. 7 shows the absorbance (band heights) 
of the SiH band in the difference spectra of our samples (hydrogenated only and hydrogenated 
and heat treated) as function of ΔcOH. The data define a linear relation, demonstrating the 
proportionality between SiH and OH groups. However, the linear regression of the data does 
not pass through the origin and intersects the x-axis at 23 ppm OH suggesting that this amount 
of hydroxyl is formed by another process than that described by reaction (3) and has to be 
taken into account for the calculation of SiH concentration. On the basis of this consideration 
we calculated the SiH concentrations for our hydrogenated samples (not heat treated) to be 
778 to 911 ± 25 ppm (Table 3). Taking all samples into account, the extinction coefficient 
2255(SiH) was determined to be 45 ± 3 l/mol cm, corresponding to 0.58 ± 0.04 times that of 
hydroxyl in vitreous silica. This number is close to that of Morimoto et al. [46] (0.57 ± 0.05 
times that of hydroxyl) but lies above the extinction coefficient determined by Shelby [47] 
(0.45 ± 0.06 times that of hydroxyl). Although these values for  2255(SiH) are in the same 
order of magnitude, the variations are up to  25% and can be caused by several factors. The 
extinction coefficient  2255(SiH) determined previously [46, 47] and in this study were 
obtained assuming that reaction (3) describes adequately the formation of hydroxyl and 
hydride. However, different silica glass types were used in these studies (Vitreosil Opaque 
[46], Suprasil, Suprasil W, Amersil T-08 [47] and Quartzil C (this study)) which may have 
contained different amounts of structural defects (such as oxygen vacancies and non-bridging 
oxygen atoms) changing the relative amounts of SiH and OH groups, which then lead to some 
of the differences for the determined  2255(SiH). In addition, using different spectrometers and 
different data processing procedures (e.g. baseline corrections) can cause variations for IR 
extinction coefficients [48]. It is worth noting that the accuracy for the absolute magnitude of 
2255(SiH) and thus the calculated concentration of SiH groups depends on the accuracy of 

3673(OH) used for the determination of the water content.  

Fig. 7. : Absorbance (band heights) of the SiH band in the difference spectra of our samples (hydrogenated only 
and hydrogenated and heat treated) as a function of the OH concentration calculated from the OH band at 3673 
cm−1 in these spectra (ΔcOH=cOH(hydrogenated sample) − cOH(starting glass)).

band at 2255 cm−1, attributed to the vibration of SiH 

 

 

The larger amount of additional water and SiH in experiment Q6-IW (2 kbar, 955°C, 2 h, IW) 
than in experiments Q2-IW and Q3-IW (2 kbar, 800°C, 10 h, IW, see Table 3) is probably not 
an effect of temperature, but results more probably from problems with the IW buffer 
assemblages of Q2-IW and Q3-IW, in which the buffer was consumed before the end of the 
experiments. Therefore fH2 at the final stage of the experiments was less than the equilibrium 
fH2 of the IW buffer assemblage. 

The amounts of molecular H2 dissolved in our samples were estimated from the heights of the 
4138 cm−1 bands in the IR spectra and the extinction coefficient  4140(H–H)=0.26 l/mol cm 
given in Shelby [1] to range between 349 and 451 ppm H2 corresponding to 2.29 × 1020–
2.96 × 1020 molecules/cm3 glass. These are less than those of Shelby [1] and Hartwig [22] 
who reported H2 concentrations of 3.5 × 1020 and 6 × 1020 molecules/cm3 glass for samples 
hydrogenated at a PH2 of  860 bars and temperatures of 225°C and 90°C, respectively. 
Although these numbers should not be compared directly since different starting materials, 
experimental conditions and analytical techniques were used, the data show unambiguously 
the negative correlation of H2 solubility with increasing temperature. Such trends were 
already observed for the solubilities H2, D2 and noble gases in vitreous silica at low pressures 
(<1 bar) [5, 49] and for Ar at 1200 bars [8]. 

5. Conclusions 

For silica glass hydrogenated at 2 kbar total pressure, 800°C and 955°C and H2 pressures of 
960–975 bars, two main dissolution mechanisms of H2 have been observed: a ‘physical' 
dissolution of molecular H2 and a ‘chemical' dissolution in which H2 dissociates to form SiH 
and SiOH groups. From the position and the line width of the H2 band in the Raman spectra 
we conclude that the H2 molecules interact with the silicate network. This interaction is 
confirmed by the IR spectra showing a band which could be assigned to the vibration of 
molecular H2. We conclude that in both, Raman and IR spectra the line shape of the H2 band 
is asymmetrical because it is the envelope of several contributions (at least 3) due to H2 
molecules located in different structural sites in the silicate network. The shape of the H2 
bands is similar in the IR and Raman spectra, implying that all sites have the same deviation 
from centrosymmetry. From the results of our quench rate dependent experiments we 
conclude that the chemical dissolution of hydrogen (SiH and SiOH) can be quenched to room 
temperature without changing relative concentrations or exsolution of hydrogen. The 
determined extinction coefficient for the SiH band in the IR spectra of Quartzil C is in 
reasonable good agreement with those of previous studies, but more data are required to 
further constrain this coefficient, necessary for reliable determinations of SiH concentrations 
in vitreous silica. 

The spectroscopic results obtained for vitreous silica glass hydrogenated at elevated pressures 
and temperatures (800°C and 955°C, 2 kbar, IW) are in a good agreement with those of 
previous studies (performed at either elevated pressures or elevated temperatures). Although 
the experiments in this study were performed on glasses and not on silica liquids, the results 
are qualitatively similar to those obtained from glasses which were molten at 1 bar under a 
pure H2 atmosphere [21].

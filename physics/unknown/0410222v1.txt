Abstract 

The floating potential 

 of a probe, emitting a sufficiently high electron cur-

*
,emflV

rent, yields a fairly accurate approximation of Φ

pl. This is an advantage in comparison to 

the conventional Langmuir probe where, after determination of the electron temperature 

Te, the plasma potential can only be derived indirectly from the formula Φpl = Vfl + αTe, 

where α is a function of the ratio of the electron to the ion saturation currents (α is around 

2.4 in a magnetised hydrogen plasma). In addition, an emissive probe also works if there 

are electron drifts or beams in the plasma. Emissive probes are usually realised by small 

directly  heated  loops  of  W-wire.  Drawbacks  of  this  design  are  the  limited  lifetime,  the 

low electron emissivity of W and the voltage drop across the wire. We have developed a 

new type of emissive probe, which is heated by an infrared high-power diode laser with a 

maximum  output  power  of  50 W.  The  probe  consists  of  a  small  cylinder  of  LaB6.  The 

probe was inserted into the edge region of the VINETA helicon discharge plasma. Basic 

features of emissive probes were verified.  

1. Introduction 

For many decades, emissive probes are in use in laboratory plasmas for a fast direct determi-

nation of the plasma potential Φpl. Only recently emissive probes have been applied for the 

first time also in the edge plasma region of fusion experiments for measuring Φpl and related 

parameters like the electric field and fluctuations of the potential and electric field [1,2,3,4,5]. 

The  floating  potential 

  of  a  probe,  which  emits  a  sufficiently  high  electron  current,  is 

*

close to Φ

pl. In contrast to that, with conventional Langmuir probes the plasma potential can 

only be determined indirectly from the formula

where Ies,is are the electron and ion saturation currents, respectively. This formula can be de-

rived from simple Langmuir probe theory for the probe voltage Vp ≤ Φpl. Obviously, for this 

formula Te has to be determined at first, which is not an easy task, especially in the edge re-

gion of a toroidal plasma, where there can be strong gradients and fluctuations of the tempera-

ture.  The  factor  α =  ln(Ies/Iis)  is  in  general  around  2.4  for  hydrogen  in  a  magnetised  plasma 

[2]. For an emissive probe Eq. (1) becomes

where Iem is the current emitted from the probe into the plasma [2]. For Iem = Ies – Iis, the elec-

tron current from the plasma is compensated and the floating potential of the probe is shifted 

completely  towards  Φpl,  i.e.,

valid for Vp ≤ Φpl, purely Maxwellian electrons and for neglecting space charges around the 

probe. For comparison with the experimental data it is practical to define the difference be-

tween  the  actual  floating  potential  and  the  plasma  potential  normalised  to  the  electron  tem-

perature:

Eqs. (3,4) demonstrate the typical behaviour of an emissive probe: the more it is heated, 

the larger is Iem, the smaller ∆ becomes and the more its floating potential approaches Φpl, un-

til for Iem = Ies – Iis, ∆ = 0.

A  typical  conventional  emissive  probe  is  realised  by  a  loop  of  tungsten  wire  of  about 

0.2 mm diameter and about 8 mm length, which is inserted into a double-bore ceramic tube. 

The  probe  is  heated  by  an  external  power  supply  or  battery  until  electron  emission  starts.

Drawbacks  of  this  design  are  the  lim-

ited  lifetime  of  the  tungsten  wire,  the 

low electron emissivity of tungsten and 

the voltage drop across the wire.  

2. Probe design  

LaB6-
probe

We  have  developed  a  prototype  of  a 

new  emissive  probe,  which  is  heated 

by  an  infrared  high-power  diode  laser 

JenLas  HDL50F  from  the  company 

JenOptik,  Jena,  Germany,  with  a 

maximum output power of 50 W and a 

wavelength of 808 nm. The laser beam 

is coupled to a conventional glass fibre 

of about 3 m length that terminates in a 

lens  head,  by  which,  in  a  distance  of 

15 cm, a focus of 0.6 mm diameter can 

be produced. This laser-head was posi-

tioned  directly  on  a  quartz-glass  win-

dow  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of 

the  probe  insertion.  Fig.  1  shows  this 

set-up schematically.  

The  probe  consists  of  a  small 

cylinder  of 

lanthanum  hexaboride 

(LaB6) with a diameter of 3.2 mm and 

a  height  of  2.2 mm.  This  gives  a  total 
area  of  about  Ap ≅  38 mm2.  The  LaB6 

electrode  is  connected  to  a  molybdenum  wire  of  0.2 mm  diameter,  which  also  provides  the 

electrical connection to the probe. The Mo-wire was spliced with a number of copper threads 

and pulled through a one-bore ceramic tube [6]. The probe is inserted into the plasma cylinder 

of  VINETA  [7],  which  produces  a  magnetized  argon  plasma  of  10 cm  diameter  and  4 m 
length in a magnetic field up to 0.1 T with a density of about 1019 m–3, an electron tempera-

ture of 3 eV and an ion temperature of 0.2 eV. The plasma is produced by a helicon discharge 

at moderate radiofrequency powers of less than 6 kW.  

3. Experimental results and discussion 

Fig. 2 shows the increase of the temperature of the LaB6 probe with the laser power, which 

was  determined  without  plasma.  For 50 W the temperature of the LaB6 probe  piece reaches 

1830°C,  at  which  value,  according  to  the  Richardson  law  (with  the  Richardson  constant 

*

2K2 and the work function WLaB6

 = 2,66 eV), this substance emits an electron 

current  density  of  about  54  A/cm2  under  field-free  emission  conditions.  According  to  that, 
from our probe with Ap ≅ 38 mm2 we can in principle produce an emission current of about 

20 A.  

Fig.  3  shows  a  set  of  current-voltage  (I-V)  characteristics  of  the  laser-heated  emissive 

probe  in  the  plasma  with  increasing  laser  heating  power.  The  typical  behaviour  of  a  probe 

with  increasing  electron  emission  current  is  well  verified.  At  first,  when  the  probe  is  not 

heated at all (black line), the I-V trace is that of a cold probe with a very small ion saturation

much larger electron saturation current 

on  the  right-hand  side.  We  notice  that 

the floating potential of the probe is on 

the  negative  side,  i.e.,  Vfl ≅  –3.3 V. 

When  the  laser  heating  is  turned  on 

and  the  temperature  of  the  probe  in-

creases, an electron emission current is 

produced  which  superimposes  on  the 

ion  current.  The  higher  the  emission 

current becomes, the more the floating 

potential  shifts  to  the  right-hand  side 

until above about 20 W a saturation of 

this value occurs at 

 ≅ +8.8 V. This is in agreement with the well-known behaviour of

However, the inserted value of the plasma potential, Φpl = +11.6 V, (and of the electron 

temperature,  Te =  4.12 eV)  have  been  determined  from  the  cold  I-V  characteristic  (for  PL = 

0 W) for comparison. Immediately we see what is also visible for the eye from the character-

istics  of  Fig.  3,  namely  that  the  saturated  value  of  the  emissive  probe  floating  potential

below this value.  

One  more  surprising  fact,  which 

is  in  contradiction  to  the  usual  ideal-

ised concept of an emissive probe [8], 

can be seen from the I-V traces of Fig. 

3:  With  increasing  emission  current, 

also  the  electron  saturation  current 

somewhat.  Also  this  fact  has  already 

been  observed  previously  [2],  but  it  is 

not yet clarified satisfactorily.

laser heating power, here demonstrated by the negative difference –∆ (Eq. 4) between the ac-

tual value Vfl,em(PL) and Φpl = 11.6 V. For better insight the negative value of ∆ is shown here 

since it indicates the shift of Vfl,em(PL) towards the plasma potential. Starting from a value of 

∆ ≅ 3.6 (which corresponds to the cold floating potential Vfl ≅ −3.3 V) of the unheated probe, 

with  increasing  heating  power  the  floating  potential  rises.  At  a  laser  power  of  PL ≅  13 W, 

Vfl,em  jumps  up  and  reaches  the  aforementioned  final  saturation  of 

 =  +8.8 V  for  P

L ≥

40 W, which corresponds to ∆ ≅ 0.68. This value lies about 2.9 Te above Vfl, thus ∆0 ≅ 2.9 (Eq. 

As  already  indicated  above,  we  observe  that  the  saturated  value  of 

*
,emflV

  remains  by 

 Te below the value of Φpl = +11.6 V determined from the cold characteristic. This 
about 0.68
systematic discrepancy is well known [9,10], and the value 0.68 Te is in good agreement with 

an  emissive  probe  simulation  by  Reinmüller  [11].  It  is  ascribed  to  the  formation  of  a  space 

charge sheath around the probe consisting of emitted electrons, which cannot leave the probe 

even for Vp ≤ Φpl due their much lower temperature Tp ≅ 0.2 eV than that of the plasma elec-

trons (Te = 4.12 eV). Therefore the average unperturbed current density of plasma electrons is 

higher than that of emitted electrons. The probe, having to re-establish the necessary equilib-

rium for the floating condition between the two opposite electrons fluxes towards and away 

from it, makes its floating potential lower than Φpl. Thereby the flux of plasma electrons to-

wards the probe is reduced whereas the emitted electrons are accelerated towards the plasma 

until their fluxes are equal again. Compared to these fluxes, the ion flux is so small that we 

have ignored it for our basic considerations.  

We  note,  however,  that  Ye  and  Takamura  [9]  found  that  the  floating  potential  of  a 

strongly emitting probe should be around one Te below the real value of the plasma potential. 

This is not in keeping with our above-mentioned result.  

Also the slight increase of the electron saturation current on the right side of the charac-

teristic with increasing emission current is perhaps due the emitted electrons. Although on this 

side, where Vp > Φpl, the emitted electrons cannot leave the probe, they might still expand the 

electron-rich space charge sheath around the probe, thereby increasing the probe area which is 

effective  for  electron  collection.  In  this  case  the  space  charge  is  of  course  electron-rich  and 

primarily formed by the plasma electrons which are accelerated towards the probe. This effect 

might  have  something  in  common  with  the  formation  of  an  ion-rich  space  charge  sheath  in 

front of a positively biased plane probe in a DP-machine plasma, in which a strong ion beam 

is  produced 

from 

the 

source  chamber 

towards 

the  probe  [12],  by  which 

effect the effective collect-

ing  area  of  the  probe  is 

also strongly increased and 

an additional knee is found 

in  the  I-V  characteristic  of 

the probe.

sibly  related  to  a  space

charge of emitted electrons need further clarification. To this end, the diode system consisting 

of the emissive surface of the probe and the surrounding plasma has to be treated comprehen-

sively. At the moment, simulations approaches are under way, which treat this system in vari-

ous ways.  

Fig. 5 shows a radial profile of the plasma potential through the VINETA plasma col-

umn, measured by the laser-heated emissive probe. These results are in keeping with analo-

gous measurements in a Q-machine, but do not agree with other measurements in VINETA. 

Also this discrepancy has still to be clarified.

Fig.  6  shows  a  typical  regular  oscillation  signal  which  has  been  registered  with  the 

probe  fully  heated  emissive  probe.  The  position  was  in  the  edge  region  of  the  VINETA 

plasma column in the helicon regime at an argon pressure of 0.22 Pa. Fig. 6a shows the time 

series  of  the  oscillations,  from  which  we  discern  that  the  oscillation  occurs  between  about  

–0.5 V and +1.0 V, thus has an amplitude of 0.75 V approximately. Fig. 6b shows the FFT of 

the  same  signal.  We  see  that  the  first  harmonic  has  a  frequency  of  about  9 kHz.  The  most 

probable explanation for this instability is a drift type one, driven by the density gradient in 

the edge region.  

4. Conclusion 

We have succeeded to construct a laser-heated electron emissive probe which can produce a 

much  higher  emission  current  than  a  conventional  emissive  wire  probe.  It  has  also  a  much 

longer life time since we have observed no evaporation or sputtering of the LaB6 piece even 

after many hours of constant strong irradiation with the infrared laser. The probe has also a 

better time response  since no electric heating system with a high internal capacity is  neces-

sary.

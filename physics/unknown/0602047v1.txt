Abstract 

 
The  view  provided  by  Z  theory,  based  on  its  quantum-relativistic 
operators,  is  an  integrated  picture  of  the  micro  and  macro  quantities 
relationships.  
The axiomatic formulation of the theory is presented in this paper.   
The theory starts with the existence of the wave function, the existence 
of  three  fundamental  constants  h,  c  and  G  as  well  as  the  physical 
quantity Rc (the radius of the space-time continuum) plus the definition 
of a general form for the quantum-relativistic functional operators. 
Using such starting point the relationships between relativity, quantum 
mechanics and cosmological quantities can be clarified.

Basic notation 
 
As a first step we need to clarify the notation used in this work. 
The space-time co-ordinates are expressed as follows: 
 

s  = (ct , i xr ) = (ct ,ix,iy,iz) = (s 1,s 2,s 3,s 4) 

 
where i  is the imaginary unit. 
 
Consistently, the momentum four-vector is: 
      

p = (

, i pr ) = (

E
c

E
c

, ip x,ip y,ip z) = (p 1,p 2,p 3,p 4) 

 
We  form  the  dot  product  with  itself  of  each  of  the  two  four-vectors 
above to obtain: 
 

s o s = c 2t 2- x2- y 2- z 2 = s 2 
 
2- p y

2- p z

2 = m 0

p o p = E 2/c 2- p x

2c 2  

to realise that such dot products are equal to the relativistic space-time 
continuum equation and to the relativistic energy equation, respectively. 
 
Only  using  the  above  four-vector  representation  we  achieve  a  real 
number for the rest mass m0 and for the space-time interval s when the 
particle speed is less then the speed of light.  
 
On the basis of such a definition of the four-vector quantities we define 
the four-gradient as follows: 
 

∂
nns

∂

4,1=

∂

1.  Z Theory: the axiomatic formulation 
 
The axiomatic formulation of Z theory is based on the following set of 
fundamental statements: 
 

Axioms 

1)  The state of a physical system is described by its own wave function Ψ. 

2)  There are three fundamental constants in the physical world: the Planck 
constant  h,  the  speed  of  light  c  and  the  gravitational  constant  G.  In 
addition  there  is  a  fundamental  quantity:  the  radius  of  the  space-time 
continuum, R c. 
 

3)  The general form of the quantum-relativistic functional operators is: 

[QO]  = 

        [QO] = 

K

QO

∂

K

QO (

,

∂
yi∂

,

∂
zi∂

) 

 

 
where KQO is to be substituted with the three constants h, c, G or 

2
cR . 

 
4)  Application of each quantum-relativistic functional operator to the wave 
function Ψ generates a physical quantity which is the physical aspect of 
the  operator.  Additional  physical  quantities  arise  using  different 
combinations of  the four basic functional operators.  
 
 
Our work begins from this set of axioms using the powerful tool of the 
quantum-relativistic functional operators as defined previously. 
 
However, before presenting the analysis we need to derive the general 
form  of  the  four-vectors  and  of  the  algebraic  equations  associated  to 
four-vectors in detail. This is done in the following steps. 

 
 

 

 

 

4

 

General form of the four-vectors 
 
The third axiom contains the general  form  of  the  four-operator,  which 
will  not  be  repeated  here.  To  explicit  the  structure  of  the  four-vectors  
we first need to define the wave function. For the free particle we will 
use: 

2
i
π
h

rr
xptE
o−

)

(

  Ψ = 

e

and this means that:   Ψ = 

e

i
2
π
h

(

sp o

)

 

 
The  latter  expression  of  the  wave  function  shows  its  relativistic 
invariance immediately, the exponent being the result of the dot product 
of  the  two  position  and  momentum  four-vectors  multiplied  by 
constants. 
 
The general form of the quantum-relativistic operator is applied to the 
wave function of the free particle to obtain:

so that:   [QO] Ψ = 

K QO E (1, iβx , iβy , iβz ) Ψ     where: βα  = 
ch

αv
c

. 

This  is  the  general  form  of  the  correspondence  between  the  four-
operator [QO] and the associated four-vector: 
 

 qv = 

K QO E (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ),  in other words: 
ch

 
which states that qv is an eigen-vector of the four-operator [QO]. 

[QO] Ψ = qv Ψ 

 

 

 

5

 

Algebraic and differential equations general form 
 
We now use the expression of the qv four-vector in the dot product with 
itself:  

qv o qv  = 

2

K QO E 2 (1 - β2
22
ch

 ) = q 0

2  

 
This quantity is a relativistic invariant, in particular equal to its value in 
the reference system of the particle, q 0
K QO E 2 (1 - β2
22
ch

2.  Consequently, we can write: 

K QO E 0
22
ch

 ) = 

2 

2

2

 
This is the general form of the algebraic equations associated to the dot 
product of each four-vector with itself.  
Using  the  same  process,  we  can  derive  the  general  form  of  the 
differential  equations  associated  to  the  dot  product  of  each  four-
operator with itself. Applying the four-operator dot product to the wave 
function, we have: 
 

[QO][QO] Ψ = [QO]2 Ψ =

and  we  may  write  this  equation  in  a  more  compact  form  using  the 
d’Alembert operator: 

(cid:133) 2Ψ = 

 [QO]2 Ψ 

2
4π

2

QOK

 
This  is  the  expression  of  the  general  differential  equations  obtained 
from  the  definition  of  the  four-operators.  It  has  to  be  noted  that  the 
d’Alembert  operator  is  relativistically  invariant.  As  a  consequence, 
when applied to the wave function,  it produces values which are equal 
to that calculated in the reference system of the considered phenomena.  
Thus:

(cid:133) 2Ψ = 

 q0

2 Ψ

QOK

 
where  the  quantity  q0  on  the  right  side  can  be  easily  identified  using 
considerations of dimensional analysis based on the dimensions of each 
different quantity KQO. 
 
 
2.  Differential equations and equivalent physical descriptions  
 
On  the  basis  of  the  above  considerations  the  differential  operators 
defined  through  the  use  of  the  three  fundamental  constants  and  of  the 
evolutionary variable generate a system of four differential equations:

The  second  is  a  wave  equation  which  describes  a  vibrational 
phenomenon  having  a  frequency  ν0.  The  third  equation  concerns  the 
gravitational  aspect  of  the  physical  reality.  We  need  to  go  into  more 
detail but, for the moment, we just observe that g0 has the dimensions of 
a squared velocity divided by a mass.  The last equation deals with the 
space-time aspect of the physical reality. It is sufficient here to note that 
the  quantity  s0  has  the  dimension  of  a  length  and,  actually,  is  a 
relativistic space-time interval.  
 
The main property of  the above differential equations system is that the 
left hand side members of  the differential equations are all equal to the 
wave  equation.  On  the  basis  of  this  property  we  need  to  point  out  the 
following  very  important  fact:  all  equations  may  be  considered  as 
different aspects of the same physical reality.  
In  other  words  talking  about  a  particle  proper  mass  has  the  same 
meaning as talking about its proper frequency, its proper gravitation or 
its proper space-time interval.  This fact will allow us to deduce a very 
important  set  of  equivalence  laws,  some  of  them  already  known  and 
verified experimentally, some of them completely new. We are now at 
the  heart  of    Z  theory  and  we  are  going  to  explain  the  very  important 
equivalence relationships in the following steps.

This first equivalence between the eigen values of the momentum and 
frequency functional operators generates, from the axioms of Z theory, 
the equivalence law discovered by L.V. De Broglie.  
We have to point out that the form here deduced is more general since it 
involves  the  squared  values  of  frequency  and  mass.  This  fact  is 
obviously  true  for  all  equivalency  laws  we  will  analyse  in  the  next 
steps.  However,  for  the  sake  of  simplicity,  it  will  be  omitted  in  the 
following presentation.

as we have already noted, g0 has the dimensions of a squared velocity

In other words, the definition of the Planck mass arises in a natural way 
when one compares the momentum and gravitational description of the 
considered phenomena.  
Let’s look at the formulation of a new concept: since the quantity M0 is 
strictly related to the particle of mass m0 through the above hyperbolic 
relationship,  we  will  call  M0    the  proper  mass  of  the  eigen-universe 
associated to the particle.

We  are  going  to  analyse  in  more  detail  this  relationship  for  the 
following two particular cases: 
 

s0 =  0       →  

 = 0  →     m0

2 =  0    →     m0 =  0

If the space-time interval is null the mass of the correspondent particle 
is equal to zero.

If  the  space-time  interval  is  equal  to  the  radius  of  our  space-time 
continuum (Rc = ctc = ctUNI ), the mass of the correspondent particle will 
be  equal  to  h/cR c.  It  is  quite  obvious  now  to  observe  that  this 
relationship,  expressed  as:  R c  =  h/m 0c,  is  the  usual  definition  of  the 
particle Compton wavelength: 
 

cλ  = 

h
cm
0

 

 
As a consequence we can generalise the interpretation of the Compton 
wavelength concept as the radius of the space-time continuum which is 
correspondent to a specific particle. 
In fact, in the general case, the Compton wavelength of a particle is not 
necessarily equal to the radius of our space-time continuum.  
This brings us to the formulation of  two new physical concepts: 
 

Eigen-universe 

The  eigen-universe  of  a  particle  of  proper  mass  m0  is  the  space-time 
continuum with radius R0 such that: 
 

The  eigen-particle  of  a  universe  with  radius  R0  of  its  space-time 
continuum is a particle of proper mass m0 such that:  
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

R0  = 

h

Eigen-particle 

m0 = 

h
cR

10

 

We  may  now  try,  with  the  help  of  these  new  concepts,  to  clarify  the  
equivalence law between momentum and position: 
 

2

Rc = 
s

0

h
cm
0

 

s0 R0  = 

2
cR  

 
This  expression  states  that the  space-time interval  s0 is equivalent to 
the  particle  of  proper  mass  m0.  As  a  result  we  may  talk  of  s0  as  the 
quantum space-time interval correspondent to a particle of proper mass 
m0. Then we may write the above expression as follows:

The quantum space-time interval of a particle multiplied by the radius 
of its eigen-universe is always equal to the square of the radius of our 
space-time continuum.

which expresses the existing relationship between the mass of a eigen-
universe  and  the  correspondent  eigen-particle  proper  frequency.  We 
note,  however,  that  the  two  non-constant  quantities  in  the  above 
relationship  correlate  a  property  of  the  eigen-universe  (mass)  to  a 
property of the particle (frequency). We can derive a different equation 
which is able to involve congruent  quantities:  both  from  the  universes 
or both from the particles.  In the case of a particle, we will find again 
the first equivalence law of L.V. De Broglie. To deduce a new equation 
in  the  case of  a  universe,  we  can apply the equivalence between mass 
and frequency to an eigen-universe as follows: 

 

11

 

  

So that: 

M0 c2 = hΝ0 

Mp

2c2 = hΝ0 m0 

→   Ν0 m0G = c3 

 
Summarising,  we  can  write  down  the  following  four  relationships 
covering all the possible combinations between the eigen-universe and 
eigen-particle masses and frequencies: 
 

m0 c 2 = hν0  

M0 c2 = hΝ0 

 
ν0 M0 G = c3  Ν0 m0 G = c3

Also for this relationship we can consider two different particular cases: 
 
s0 = 0   →   ν 0 = 0 
 
if the quantum space-time interval is null the correspondent frequency 
is equal to zero. 

 

s0 = Rc    →  

=ν0

c
cR

 

 
if  the  quantum  space-time  interval  is equal  to  the  radius  of  our  space-
time  continuum  (which  may  be  identified  with  RUNI,  the  radius  of  our 
universe)  the  correspondent  frequency  is  equal  to  the  inverse  of  our 
universe age. If this is the case, such frequency should be identical to 
the Hubble constant H0. Moreover, we can say that this frequency will 
be the proper frequency of the eigen-particle of our universe, i.e. of the 
graviton, so that: 
 

 

 

12

 

ν0 = νH = H0 = νg 
 
Besides  the  above  specific  considerations,  we  will  also  be  able  to 
deduce another very important equation using:    ν0 Rc
 
If we pose: Rc = c tc  and  s0 = cτ0  (where τ0  is defined as the quantum 
2  =  τ0  and  taking  into 
proper  time  of  the  particle),  we  obtain:  ν0  tc
account that we can express the oscillation frequency as the inverse of 
the oscillation period (i.e. ν0 = 1/T0), we may write another hyperbolic 
equation: 

2 = cs 0. 

τ0T0  =  tc

2 

 
In  other  words  the  quantum  proper  time  multiplied  by  the  intrinsic 
2 which may 
oscillation period of a physical entity is always equal to tc
be identified with the square of the age of our universe. 
 
But we can still develop some additional considerations.  
Multiplying both members of  ν0 Rc
 

2 = cs 0  by  νg  we have: 

since νg = c/R c : 

 
and if we use again: 
 

ν0 νg Rc

2 = cs 0νg 

s 0νg = ν0 Rc 

νg s0 = 

t
c c = 
0T

c 0τ
ct

 

 ν0  = 1/T0   

and: 

 Rc = c tc   

we have: 

 
Again, if we identify tc with tUNI, the right hand side of this last equation 
is  a  velocity  proportional  to  the  ratio τ0/tUNI  with  the  proportionality 
constant  equal  to c.  Being  this  velocity  univocally  associated  to  s0  we 
may write this velocity as v0 and obtain as a consequence what we may 
call at this point the prototypical Hubble law: 
 

v0 = H0 s0 
 

 

13

 

where v0 is the galactic recession velocity as evaluated by an observer 
located  inside  our  physical  universe.    Let  us  point  out  that  the  above 
considerations imply the following: 

v0 = 

c

0τ
t
UNI

 

v0 = acτ0 

 
taking into account that c/tUNI has the dimensions of an acceleration, we 
may write: 

 
where  ac    can  be  identified  as  our  space-time  continuum  intrinsic 
acceleration.

which  express  the  correspondence  between  the  mass  of  an  eigen-

Now  if  we  pose:     τ0  =  tUNI      which  means  obviously:  s0  =  RUNI  ,  and 
identify tc with tUNI  we have:  
 

M0  =

which shows the correlation existing between gravitation and total mass 
of the universe.  
 
Another  very  interesting  result  is  obtained  using  the  relationship 
deduced in the momentum-position comparison: s0 R0 = Rc

Gravitational Radius 

It  is  the  famous  equivalence  law  between  the 
particle  and  wave  energy  formulation  postulated 
for the first time by L.V. De Broglie.  

This  relation  allows  us  to  calculate  the  value  and 
understand the meaning of the Planck mass as  the  
connection element between micro-macro cosmos 
Equivalence between the proper mass of a particle 
and  correspondent  quantum  space-time  interval.  It 
is  used  to  interpret  the  Compton  wavelength  of  a 
particle as the radius of its eigen-universe. 
Equivalence  between  particle  proper  frequency  
and  mass  of  its  eigen-universe.  From  a  physical 
point of view it is equivalent to De Broglie law. 

It 

implies 

the  prototype  of 

Equivalence  between  proper  frequency  of  a 
particle and the correspondent quantum space-time 
interval. 
the 
cosmological Hubble Law  
Equivalence  between  proper  mass  of  an  eigen- 
universe  and  correspondent  quantum  space-time 
interval.  The    definition  of  gravitational  radius  is 
deduced from this equivalence relationship.

3.  Fundamental concepts of Z theory 
 
In this section the fundamental concepts of Z theory are outlined. 
 
Eigen-particle and eigen-universe 
 
We  need  first to  clarify and  generalise  the  concepts  of  eigen-particle 
and eigen-universe, to provide a complete new picture of our physical 
world.  This  can  be  done  by  starting  again  from  the  equivalence 
between gravitation and position which generates the identity between 
gravitational radius and radius of the eigen-universe: 
 

so that:  

and:

As  a  consequence  we  can  identify  the  left  hand  side  as  the 
gravitational radius of the particle:

r0 =

Interpreting  the  quantity  h/M0c  as  the  radius  of  the  eigen-particle  of 
the universe with mass M0, we have: 
 

 
We  can  summarise  the  concepts  of  eigen-particle  and  eigen-universe 
as follows:

We should note that in the above relationships the quantities related to 
eigen-particles or eigen-universes are completely interchangeable.  
This  introduces  the  concept  of  UP  symmetry  (Universe-Particle 
symmetry) as a natural (logical) consequence. 
In other words, UP symmetry assures us that we can describe physical 
reality  in  terms  of  either  particles  or  universes,  in  an  equivalent 
manner.  
 
 
The eigen-particle of the universe 
 
For example, we may now calculate the mass of the eigen-particle of 
our  universe.  This  is  done  using  the  second  expression  of  the  above 
list. With the following values of the involved quantities: 
 

h = 6.6256  10-34 J s 

     c = 2.998  108 m/s   

R0  ≅ 1.42  1026 m 

 

m 0 = 1.556 10-68 Kg. 

 
the result is:  
 
We can now also calculate easily the equivalent mass of the universe 
using the last of the above laws: 
 

MUNI = Mp

2 / m0   ≅ 1.9126  1053  Kg 

 

 

18

 

and  observe  that  this  result  is  in  line  with  the  predictions  of  the 
cosmological models derived from general relativity theory.  
 
The particle with the above proper mass m0 can be naturally identified 
as  the  quantum  projection  of  our  universe  and  in  this  sense  we  may 
recognise it as the quantum of gravity, i.e. the graviton (m0 = mg).  
 
In other words: 
 
 

the graviton is the smallest massive particle existing in 
our  universe,  its  Compton  wavelength  is  equal  to  the 
radius of the universe.  

 
 
The role of the Planck quantities 
 
One of the relationships already found, relates the mass of the particle 
to the mass of its eigen-universe: 
 

m0 M0  =  

 = 

2
pM  

ch
G

On the other hand we can try the same approach with the radius of the 
particle and the radius of its eigen-universe, which is: 
 

r0 R0 = 

h
cM
0

h
cm
0

 = 

2

h
22
cM
p

 = 

hG
3c

 = L p

2 

 

2.   

Dividing the above by c2, we obtain:  tr TR = Tp
 
If    m0  is  the  mass  of  the  eigen-particle  of  the  universe:  m0  =  MMIC  , 
where MMIC  is the proper mass of the microcosmos.  
  
It  follows  that:  M0  =  MMAC  ,  where  MMAC    is  the  proper  mass  of  the 
macrocosmos (the mass of the universe). Using similar considerations 
for lenghts ( LMIC
 

 ,LMAC ) and times (TMIC ,TMAC ) we have: 

 

19

 

MMIC 

LMIC 

TMIC 

2 
 . MMAC = Mp
2 
 . LMAC = Lp
 . TMAC = Tp

2 

 
The  Planck  quantities  are  the  point  of  equilibrium  between 
microcosmos  and  macrocosmos  and  show  the  existence  of  this 
hyperbolic symmetry in the universe. 
 
More  insight  can  be  gained  by  expressing  the  above  as  follows  and 
calculating the values in the case of our universe:

where  the  first  constant  can  be  considered  representative  of  the 
“distance”  between  our  universe  and  the  Planck  universe,  while  the 
second  one  is  representative  of  the  “distance”  between  our  universe 
and its eigen-particle, the graviton. 
 
It has to be noted that the quantities tr and TR have to be properly interpreted 
as the time interval needed by the speed of light to cover a distance equal to 
the  radius  of  the  particle  r0  and  the  radius  of  the  eigen-universe  R0.  In  the 
case of the graviton, tr and TR are continuously varying, tr is decreasing and 
TR is increasing. In the case of a “normal” particle, and supposing this mass 
is constant, such quantities are obviously constants.  
On the other hand, if we consider the already deduced relationship:  
s0 R0  = R c
This relationship defines the quantum proper time of the particle τ0.  
T0  instead  is  constant  and  equal  to  TR.  This  for  a  normal  particle.  For  the 
graviton s0 = R0, so that the above expression reduces to:   T0  T0  =  2

 Explicit expressions of the four-operators and four-vectors 
 
We start with the already known four-operator and four-vector. 
 
Momentum 
 
In this case KQO = h, substituting: 

[p] = 

h
i2
π

∂
nns

∂

4,1=

     p  →  [p] = 

h
i2
π

(

∂

,

∂
xi∂

,

∂
yi∂

,

∂
zi∂

) 

 
from  which  we  are  able  to  deduce  the  Schrödinger  operators  in  the 
following form:

This  is  the  common  definition  of  the  energy-momentum  operator, 
except that the sign is reversed. The associated four-vector is: 
  

[p] Ψ = 

E (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) Ψ =

 (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) Ψ 

h
ch

E
c

[p] Ψ  = ( mc , imvpx , imvpy  , imvpz ) Ψ 

 
which shows that the momentum four-vector is an eigen-vector of the 
four-operator momentum. The expression of the four-vector is: 

p = 

 (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) 

E
c

 
and the associated algebraic equation (the relativistic energy equation) 
obtained with the dot product of the momentum four-vector with itself 
is as a consequence:  

E 2/c 2- p 2 = m 0

2c 2 

 

 

 

 

21

 

Frequency 
 
In this case KQO = c, substituting: 
 

[ν] = 

c
i2

∂

4,1=

    ν  →  [ν] = 

c
i2
π

(

∂

∂

∂

The associated four-vector is: 
 

c
ch

E
h

[ν] Ψ = 

E (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) Ψ = 

 (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) Ψ 

 
so that the final expression for the frequency four-vector is: 
 

ν = 

 (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) 

E
h

 
From  this  expression  it  is  clear  why  we  identified  this  quantity  as  a 
frequency:  in  fact  E/h  has  the  dimensions  of  a  frequency.  As  a 
consequence the intrinsic frequency four-vector is: 
 

ν = ν (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) 

 
We  may  also  associate  to  each  particle  an  intrinsic  acceleration  by 
multiplying the intrinsic frequency four-vector by c, as follows: 
 

a = νc (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) 

 
and note that the ratio between the momentum and acceleration four-
vectors is equal to a constant:   p/a = h/c 2   as well as :  p/ν = h/c 
 
Finally, the frequency algebraic equation is:  
 

ν2(1 - β2

 ) = ν0

Gravitation

The associated four-vector is:

[g] Ψ = 

E (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  )Ψ = 

 (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  )Ψ 

E
ch
G

 
so  that  we  may  express  the  gravitation  four-vector  using  the  Planck 
mass as:  

g = 

 (1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) 

E
2
pM

 
The Planck mass participates directly to the structure of the gravitation 
four-vector.  

If one defines: g =

, the algebraic equation is:  g0

2 = g 2(1 - β2).                  

E

pM

 
We may also consider the following relationships:

g =

where  M  is  a  mass  associated  to  the  particle  of  mass  m  such  that 
2.  This  above  relationship  is  obviously  true  in  the  reference 
mM=Mp

system of the particle so:   m0M0 =Mp
again the mass M0 as the proper mass of the eigen-universe associated 
to the particle of proper mass m0.

The associated four-vector is: 

s = 

E (1,iβx,iβy,iβz  ) 

To get an explicit form of the four-vector we rewrite it using G: 
 

s =

(1,iβx,iβy,iβz)   so:  s =

(1,iβx,iβy,iβz)

(which  has  the  dimensions  of  a  force)  what  we  may  consider  the 
prototype of the universal gravitational law.     
As a consequence we can write: 
 

s = 

(1, iβx  , iβy , iβz  ) 

E
CGF

 
A  very  important  result  may  be  deduced  using  the  dot  product.  We 
already know that: 

s o s = s0

so: 

2 = 

s0

So we may write:  
 
where the prototype of our usual definition of work is recognised. 
 

FGC s0 = E 0

Additionally using: E0 = m0 c2 and s0  = cτ0 we obtain:

which  may  be  interpreted  as  the  prototype  of  the  equivalence 
principle. 
 
Finally, it may be shown that the space-time continuum equation is the 
algebraic  equation  associated  to  the  dot  product  of  the  position  four-
vector with itself.  

In fact, using the relationship 

0m   = 

s

0

  in the expression of the 

h

Rc

c

dot product of the position four-vector with itself, we obtain: 
 

c 2t 2- x2  - y 2- z 2 = s 0

2  

 
and we can then write: 

 
s  = (ct ,ix,iy,iz) 

 
As  a  consequence,  the  associated  algebraic  equation  of  the  position 
operator  is  the  quantised  Einstein-Minkowski  space-time  continuum, 
i.e. the quantum space-time interval:  
 

 

s o s = c 2t 2- x 2  - y 2  - z 2 = s 0

Gravity and Electromagnetism 
 
Before  summarising  the  four-operators  and  four-vectors,  we  now  
develop  some  considerations  on  the  basis  of  the  form  of  the  four-
vector position just presented.  
We begin again from the logical functional prototype of what we will 
call  from  now  on  the  Gravitational  (space-time)  Continuum  Force 
(FGC),  and  write  down  its  value  for  the  electron.  In  this  way  we 
evaluate  the  gravitational  force  between  the  electron  and  its  eigen-
universe: 

FGC  = G 

 = G 

  ≅  9.8515 10-78 N

R

We may now ask ourselves the following question:  
“What  is  the  electrostatic  force  between  two  electrons  at  a  distance 
equal to the radius of our space-time continuum?” The answer is given 
by the Coulomb law as: 

FELS  =  Kc 

 = 1.144  10-80 N 

ee
2
cR

 
Where Kc is the Coulomb constant and e is the electronic charge. 
 
If we now introduce the fine structure constant defined as: 
 

α  =  

eK 2
c
c

h

 

FELS  = FGC 

α
2
π

 

 
it  is  easy  to  show  that  the  above  two  forces  are  related  by  the 
following relationship: 

 
So  that  the  absolute  value  of  the  electrostatic  force  is  simply  the 
gravitational continuum force multiplied by the fine structure constant 
divided by 2π . 

 

26

 

 
We may introduce at this point the Z interpretation of this result: 
 
The  electrostatic  force  is  the  gravitational  continuum  force 
between  the  first  electron  and  the  eigen-universe  of  the  second 
electron. The coupling constant is the fine structure constant.  
If  the  above  interpretation  is  correct,  the  electric  charge  is  the  direct 
consequence of the particle-universe symmetry. 
 
We  would  like  to  stress  that  without  previous  knowledge  of  the 
electrostatic  force,  but  only  on  the  basis  of  Z  theory,  one  could 
however  predict  the  existence  of  an  additional    force  besides  the 
gravitational one. 
 
 
Summary of four-operators and four-vectors 
 
We now present a summary of four-operators and four-vectors as well 
as their associated algebraic equations:

Ψ = p Ψ =

We  note  the  presence  of  four  basic  quantities  in  the  previous 
equations:    two  of  them  already  included  in  the  set  of  axioms  while 
the remaining have been deduced.  
 
We note that the set of axioms of Z theory implies the existence of 
the  Planck  mass  and  of  the  gravitational  space-time  continuum 
force prototype.  
 
The  above  defined  energy  vector  E  =  E  (1,iβx,iβy,iβz)  is  the 
physical aspect which is able to unify the different descriptions of the 
physic  world  and  in  particular:  the  dynamical  (motion),  vibrational 
(frequency), gravitational (mass) and space-time continuum (position) 
aspects. 
 
We  should  finally  summarise  the  four  quadratic  algebraic  equations 
associated to the dot product of each four-vector with itself:

4.  Quantum-relativistic algebra 
 
We would now like to explore some of the combinatorial possibilities 
offered by the four-vectors of Z theory. In the following, we are going 
to present some of results of the analysis.  
A more detailed investigation has to be made using the four-operators, 
however this is not part of the present work and will be the object of a 
separate investigation.    
The  dot  products  of  four-vectors  with  themselves  generate  the 
following relativistic invariants:

Please note that the final results are always expressed by the product 
of a proper mass with some of the fundamental constants or quantity. 
 
It  is  very  interesting  to  obtain  the  above  dot  products  for  two

Additional  four-vectors  can  be  generated  by  multiplication  of

so that: 

F0 = mg ac = FIg = FGC 

 
In  other  words  the  proper  force  F0  is  equal  to  the  inertial  intrinsic 
force of the graviton and to the gravitational continuum force. 
 
As  a  consequence,  the  Einstein  equivalence  principle  may  be 
expressed as: 
 

FIg = FGC 

 

31

 

 
A similar relationship exists for the energy: 
 

Eg = EGC 

 
showing that the internal (or intrinsic) energy of the graviton is equal 
to the gravitational continuum energy, this because:

so that the internal energy of a particle of proper mass m0 is formally 
equal to the gravitational energy of its eigen-universe.  
We will call this statement Z-equivalence principle.   
Following  the  Z-equivalence  principle,  the  inertial  properties  of  a 
particle  completely  corresponds  to  the  gravitational  properties  of  its 
eigen-universe. 
  
 
We like to conclude this part of the paper showing the use of some of 
the dot products already calculated. We already know that:

the  operators  associated 

5.  On the uncertainty principle 
 
Let’s  now  look  at  where    the  Z  theory  stands  in  relation  to  the 
uncertainty principle.  
It is worthwhile first pointing out that, in the framework of  quantum 
mechanics,  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  (as  well  as  other 
uncertainty  relationships)  can  be  directly  derived  from  the  non-
to  physicals 
commutative  algebra  of 
observables.  In  this  sense,  the  Heisenberg  uncertainty  principle  is  a 
consequence  of  the  form  of  the  operators  as  defined  by  standard 
quantum  mechanics.  The  operator  associated  to  momentum  is  a 
differential operator, while the position operator takes the form of the 
position variable. Mathematically, this produces the impossibility for 
such operators to be commutative.  
In marked contrast,  the quantum-relativistic operators defined by 
Z theory clearly obey a completely commutative algebra, because 
position  and  momentum  are  represented  by  differential  operators  in 
this theory, so that  the commutator obviously equals zero.  
To  clarify the above statements, we form the commutator of the four- 
operators in the case of quantum mechanics and in Z theory. 
The  quantum  mechanics  position  and  momentum  four-operators  can 
be defined, following the notations used in this work, as follows: 
 

[r]  = 

( 

ct

,

ix

,

iy

,

iz

)

   

[p]  = 

h
i2
π

(

∂
tc∂

,

∂
xi∂

,

∂
yi∂

,

∂
zi∂

) 

 
if we write the commutator of the four-operators we have: 
 

{ [p] , [r] } Ψ = 

h
i2
π

((

∂
tc∂

,

∂
xi∂

)

h
i2
π

 (

∂

,

∂
xi∂

,

∂
yi∂

,

∂
zi∂

)Ψ 

 
Note  that  in  the  above  expression  the  momentum  operator  has  been 
applied to the position operator and viceversa, so that the result of the 
commutator will be a four dimensional quantity.  

 

33

 

We now calculate the commutator: 
 

{ [p] , [r] } Ψ =

Ψ∂

) + 

) 

 

 

 

 

 

 

to obtain: 

{ [p] , [r] } Ψ = 

 (1,1,1,1)Ψ 

h
i2
π

 
which is the expression of the four-dimensional commutator deduced 
from the definition of the operators of standard quantum mechanics. 
 
We  now  perform  the  same  process  using  the  quantum-relativistic 
operators of Z theory, defined as follows: 
 

[s]  = 

2
Rc
i2
π

(

∂

[p] =

,

,

∂

) 

) 

and obtain in this case: 
 

{ [p] , [s] } Ψ = 

 (0,0,0,0) Ψ = (0,0,0,0)  

2
Rh c
2
π4

 
This  last  expression  shows  that  the  quantum-relativistic  operators 
commute, so we have been able to show that: 
 

the “Z reality level” does not embody any quantum uncertainty 

 

34

 

This fact may give rise to the following question: what happens, in the 
framework  of  Z  theory,  to  the  quantum  mechanics  uncertainty 
principle?  
To  answer  this  basic  question  we  have  to  analyse  the  relationship 
between the eigen-particle and eigen-universe already introduced in Z 
theory in more detail.   
This  analysis  will  bring  us  to  a  new  interpretation  and  different 
understanding of the quantum mechanics uncertainty. 
  
Let us first write the Heisenberg uncertainty relationship as: 
 

 
and move now to the reference system of the particle [7] to express it 
as:  

∆r ∆p = h 

∆r m0 c = h 

 
which  defines  the  minimum  possible  uncertainty  on  the  particle 
position.  
 
Now,  we  can  compare  this  last  expression  with  the  relationship 
between the mass of  a particle and the radius of its eigen-universe: 
 

 
and  realise  that  the  system  of  such  two  equations  gives  rise  to  the 
identity: 

m0 cR0 = h 

∆r = R0 

 
The  uncertainty  on  the  particle  position  is  equal  to  the  radius  of  its 
eigen-universe. 
 
In  other  words  the  quantum  uncertainty  is  a  consequence  of  the 
existence of the complementary law between eigen-particle and eigen-
universe,  witness  of  the  impossibility  to  separate  the  concept  of 
elementary particle and eigen-universe. 

 

35

 

The quantum uncertainty of the position of a massive particle can not 
be reduced below the radius of its eigen-universe. In the same way the 
quantum  uncertainty  on  momentum  can  not  be  reduced  below  the 
value  m0c  i.e. below the “proper” momentum of the particle. 
 
To further explain the position of Z theory on quantum uncertainty we 
can  say  that:  if  we  try  to  determine  the  particle  position  with  a 
precision  below  the  extension  of  its  eigen-universe  we  are  forcing  a 
change of the particle mass so that we are modifying and effectively 
observing  another  particle  with  respect  to  what  we  initially  want  to 
observe. 
 
The  importance  of  the  eigen-particle,  eigen-universe  duality  is  now 
completely  clear  and  highlights  a  new  physical  interpretation  of  the 
quantum uncertainty. 
 
Let us summarise our position in the following statement: 
 
The  quantum  uncertainty  is  a  consequence  of  the  forced 
confinement  of    a  particle  with  respect  to  the  radius  of  its  eigen-
universe:  the  response  of  the  physical  reality  to  the  conceptual  
separation of  the “particle” aspect with respect to the “universe” 
aspect.

6.  The meaning of  

2Ψ  

 
In  this  last  part  of  the  work,  we  would  like  to  face  one  of  the  basic 
problems of quantum mechanics, the meaning of the wave function. In 
fact  quantum  mechanics  provides  an  interpretation  for  the  squared 
module of the wave function (as the probability to find the particle in 
a  specific  space  portion),  while  no  specific  physical  interpretation  is 
provided for the wave function itself.  
In  the  following  we  will  try  to  suggest  some  developments  that  will 
bring  us  to  understand  the  deep  physical  meaning  of  the  squared 
module of a quantity which is apparently without physical meaning. 
 
We are in a position to answer this fundamental question for the case 
of a free particle. We have to go back to the formulation of differential 
equations  associated  to  the  momentum  and  position  operators  of  Z 
theory:

We  can  transform  now  the  above  equations  using  the  d’Alembert 
operator as follows: 
 

(cid:133) 2 Ψ  = 

Ψ

  

(cid:133) 2 Ψ = 

22
2

2π

Ψ

 

 
if  we  now  restrict  our  analysis  to  the  wave  function  of  the  free 
particle, the following identity holds: 
 

∗ Ψ=Ψ

1−

 

 
so that we can rearrange the two equations as: 
 

 

37

 

Ψ/(cid:133) 2Ψ = 

2

22
π4
cm
0

  

Ψ *(cid:133) 2Ψ =

2
0

2π
4
s
4
cR

 

 
we can now multiply the two equations together to obtain: 
 

 
and  using  the  relationship  between  the  quantum  space-time  interval 
and the eigen-universe radius s0
 

4 we finally have: 

2 = Rc

2R0

ΨΨ * =

2
sh
22
4
cRcm
0

ΨΨ * = 

2

h
22
2
Rcm

0

 

 

 
This last equation shows us that only the squared module of the wave 
function gives us access to the totality of information on the physical 
entity: in fact it summarises both the particle massive aspects (m0) as 
well as its space-time continuum aspects (R0). 
 
It has to be noted that the starting differential equations represent the 
propagation of a physical entity with mass (momentum operator) and 
the  propagation  of  its  own  eigen-universe  (position  operator).  Both 
equations have to be considered simultaneously to obtain what we call 
“physical reality”. 
 
Again,  this  brings  us  to  the  conclusion  that  a  particle  cannot  be 
separated  from  its  own  space-time  continuum,  and  only  the  squared 
module of the wave function is capable of summarising both aspects 
of the physical reality.  
 
It is now clear that the wave function is only part of the information 
on the physical entity. Such information has to be completed with that 
contained  in  Ψ *  to  have  an  exhaustive  knowledge  of  our  physical 
reality.

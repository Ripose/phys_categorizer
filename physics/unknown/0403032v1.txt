We report on the observation and quantitative assessment of self-trapped pulsating beams 

in a highly non-local nonlinear regime.  The experiments were conducted in nematic liquid 

crystals  and  allow  a  meaningful  comparison  with  the  prediction  of  a  scalar  theory  in  the 

perturbative limit, while addressing the need for beyond-paraxial analytical treatments.

Several remarkable nonlinear physical phenomena may be classified as solitons, or solitary 

waves.  Among  the  most  famous  is  “the  Great  [water]  Wave  of  Translation”,  originally 

reported by J. S. Russell and considered the first documented observation of solitons.[1] A 

fundamental  characteristic  unifies  soliton  phenomena:  the  discreteness  arising  in  the 

framework  of  continuous  fields  (such  as  in  electro-  and  fluid-  dynamics).  From  a 

mathematical viewpoint, solitons are solutions of specific differential equations which are 

nonlinear  and  integrable.  In  general,  however,  nonlinear  waves  which  keep  a  distinctive 

and  unchanged  identity  along  their  propagation  may  be  considered  solitons,  or  solitary 

waves  (SW),  even  when  they  are  described  by  non-integrable  systems.[2]    In  the  applied 

nonlinear optics community such a distinction is often set aside, [3] as it will in this work.  

Several  approaches  have  been  available  to  model  SW:  from  heavy  computations  to 

sophisticated analytic transforms.  More recently, a simple theoretical model was advanced 

which describes complex soliton-like dynamics and has direct relevance to the novel beam 

propagation we present here. In particular, Snyder and Mitchell described the propagation 

of optical spatial solitary waves (i. e., non-diffracting light beams which self-trap owing to 

the  nonlinearity)  in  a  highly  non-local  nonlinear  medium  (HNNM),  i.  e.  a  medium 

(described by an integro-differential constitutive relationship in the spatial coordinates) in 

which the optical field modifies the index of refraction in a kernel region much larger than 

the  beam  waist  [4].  The  model  in  Ref.  [4],  however,  was  attributed  a  limited  practical 

relevance, mainly because of the apparent lack of a physical medium (i. e., an HNNM) able 

to support such solitons. Nevertheless, nonlocal media with a nonlinear response have been 

experimentally investigated to outline their specific features in relation to light localization 

2

and optical solitons, and among them atomic gases, [5] photorefractive and liquid crystals 

(LC).[6-12]  Photorefractives  are  highly  anisotropic  crystals  with  a  finite  degree  of  non-

locality  due  to  carrier  drift  and  diffusion  [6-9],  while  LC  are  liquids  with  a  significant 

degree of molecular order and birefringence under appropriate anchoring. [10-12] 

In recent years, spatial optical solitons have been observed in a variety of nonlinear media 

and have attracted considerable interest for their potential applications to signal processing 

and  communications.[3,13-14]  Such  observations  were  mostly  carried  out  in  materials 

effectively described in terms of a local response (where the relation between the field and 

the  induced  nonlinear  polarization  can  be  taken  as  punctual),  i.  e.,  cubic  or  quadratic  or 

photorefractive [15]. 

In this Letter, after showing theoretically that a highly-nonlocal response is appropriate to 

describe  light  propagation  in  nematic  LC,  in  such  HNNM  we  experimentally  investigate 

nonlocal  optical  solitons  and  carry  out  a  quantitative  comparison  with  the  model.  Their 

features strongly differ from those of self-trapped beams in local media, and we trust that 

the  results  presented  hereby  are  relevant  in  all  those  fields  where  non-locality  cannot  be 

neglected  and  a  local  picture  fails;  among  them,  Bose-Einstein  condensation  [16]  and 

plasmas  [17]  are  worth  mentioning.  Not  only  understanding  the  interplay  between  non-

locality  and  nonlinearity  is  fundamentally  important,  but  it  also  leads  to  intriguing 

applications  of  spatial  solitons:  for  instance,  the  recently  demonstrated  non-trivial  logic 

gates based on non-local interactions between optical SW [18].   

Theory.  With reference to the highly-nonlocal regime, while the theory developed in Ref. 

[4] provides insight and general guidelines on the dynamics of spatial solitons in HNNM, a

as a nematic LC.

An alternative insightful (albeit less rigorous) way to solve Eq. (4) consists in looking for 

transverse-localized waves, in the hypothesis that the optical beam is nearly trapped, i. e., 

r(E =

2)z,0

is  almost  z-independent.  In  essence,  the  on-axis  intensity  dependence  is 

reduced  to  a  power  dependent  term  (for  a  Gaussian  solution  this  is  self-consistent),  as  in 

Ref. [4]. This approximation to the full dynamics encompassed by coupled Eqs. (1) and (3) 

accounts for the specific material constants and provides beam evolution laws in analogy to 

those in Ref. [4]:

 the soliton power.  

Thus,  the  beam  generally  undergoes  nonlinear  oscillations,  their  entity  determined  by  the 

ratio  between  the  input  and  the  soliton  power.  The  latter  fixes  the  initial  position  of  the 

particle  in  the  bell-shaped  potential.    When 

  the  particle  is  initially  settled  in  the 

sPP =

stationary point, hence it remains still with  z , corresponding to an exact soliton excitation.  

Our treatment above corresponds to assume 

1

, hence it holds for excitations around the 

s @

soliton value (

SPP @

) and enables to deal with explicit expressions.  

Eq. (6), in qualitative agreement with Ref. [4], will be used to interpret the experiments. 

The dimensionless constant  g

 (i. e., the harmonic content of the soliton) identifies various 

self-trapping  regimes.  For 

  the  beam  diffracts  at  first  before  it  starts  to  periodically 

0>g

 

6

-
L
p
pulsate, while for 

0<g

 it initially self-focuses.  L

 grows linearly with 

0W  and inversely 

with  the  square  root  of  the  power,  because  self-trapping  stems  from  a  balance  between 

diffraction and self-focusing: the natural tendency of a beam to spread, stronger when 

0W  

is smaller, is overcome by the power-dependent response. In the case 

0=g

 (i. e., 

SPP =

) 

nonlinearity  exactly  counteracts  diffraction  and  the  beam  travels  un-modified  along  z . 

Therefore,  (for  P (cid:31)  Ps)  we  can  state  that  spatial  solitons  in  highly  non-local  media  are 

pulsating beams.   

The previous result can also be interpreted by observing that, according to Eq. (4), the LC 

system behaves as a graded-index (GRIN) lens with pitch depending not on beam waist, but 

on beam peak-intensity (or power in the limit of Eq. (6)). This agrees with the definition of 

an HNNM: the field intensity in a point modifies the medium in a region much larger that 

the beam spot. When the spot size is very small, the beam does not sense the GRIN and 

widens, until  its  waist  gets  large  enough  for  the  lens  to  become  effective.  Then,  it  starts 

focusing, and the process repeats itself in a cyclic fashion. Noteworthy, despite the specific 

material setting (LC exhibiting a reorientational response which is far from saturation) and 

within the paraxial frame, the general SW trend in an HNNM qualitatively resembles the 

case of a (logarithmic) saturable nonlinearity. [20] 

The  non-local  nonlinearity  is  able  to  trap  intense  and  narrow-waist  solitary  beams.  By 

looking  at  Eq.  (6),  we  note  that  when 

0>g

  (

0<g

)  the  maximum  (minimum)  of 

2W  

depends only on material parameters and the power:

i.e.,  there  is  no  lower  (upper)  bound  to  its  minimum  (maximum) 

0W .  Although  derived 

within  the  limit  of  validity  of  Eq.  (6),  the  oscillating  behavior  is  the  main  difference 

between  our  HNNM  and  other  responses  (such  as  photorefractive,  saturable  Kerr,  or 

quadratic)  in  systems  where the SW-waist  is  a  constant  determined  by  the  light  intensity 

(left aside the internal modes of a soliton).   Noteworthy, Eq. (7) can be recast as

Eq. (8) is the existence curve for stationary nonlocal solitons. 

Experimental results. Fig. 2 shows the measured waist versus  z , as obtained by analyzing 

snapshots of the light scattered above the LC cell when SW at 

.1

m064

 were launched. 

=l

Starting at low powers (

), the oscillations progressively reduce in amplitude and their 

0>g

period decreases as the excitation goes up. This is in good qualitative agreement with the 

prediction in Eq. (6), but the experimental accuracy is inherently limited by the acquisition 

of scattered photons from the SW. To account for this, we modeled our imaging system as a 

blur,  convolving  the  retrieved  intensity  profiles  with  a  Gaussian  kernel  (G).  The  kernel 

width  was  evaluated  from  the  linear  diffraction  of  a  known  beam,  resulting  in 

)y(G

=

exp[

2

2
])m4/(y

. Due to the blur, an actual  m5m

 waist results overestimated by 

about 50%, but the error is larger than 100% for waists < m1m

. Conversely, if the waist is 

m10m

>

,  the  error  is  under  10%  (see  Fig.1,  lower  right).  Henceforth,  we  carried  out  the 

quantitative  comparison  with  the  theory  considering  only  the  maximum  waist  (from  Eq.

(7))  and  the  oscillation  period  (from  Eq.  (6)),  the  latter  taken  as  twice  the  separation 

between the first two extrema in the graph of waist versus  z (Fig. 2). 

Fig. 3a displays the measured maximum SW waist versus power. The best fit is obtained 

from Eq. (7) by introducing as a parameter the coupling efficiency  a

 of the laser power 

inP  

into the soliton-trapped power  P  (i. e., 

). By minimizing the standard deviation, 

inP/P=a

we found 

%7=a

. To further the comparison, Fig. 3b shows a plot of

 versus 

P .  The  overall  linearity  is  satisfactory  and  the  standard  deviation  from  the  model  is  4%. 

Fig.  3c  graphs  period  versus  power,  and  the  best  fit  from  Eq.  (6).  Given  the  previously 

evaluated  a

, here the fitting parameter is the minimum waist, yielding W0» 1m m. While the 

latter  could  not  be  determined  a  priori,  because  light  enters  the  sample  through  the 

interface and an LC transition layer, such wavelength-size estimate stems from a paraxial 

model and should, therefore, be taken as the indication of its inherent limit. Finally, in Fig. 

3d  the  quantity 

/1 L

2

  is  plotted  versus  P .  Once  more,  there  is  good  agreement  with  the 

calculation,  and  the  standard  deviation  is  7%.  The  overall  comparison  between  data  and 

model  is  marginally  affected  by  the  limited  experimental  accuracy;  however,  it  emerges 

clearly that we observed self-trapped optical beams in a HNNM.  Finally, it is well worth 

underlining  that  an  additional  feature  of  spatial  solitons  in  HNNM  is  their  collisional 

behavior, as predicted in Refs. [4] and [21]. Indeed,  the recently demonstrated incoherent-

like and attractive interactions between SW in the same LC provide an independent proof 

of their highly-nonlocal dynamics. [22] 

A corollary of our model Eq. (6) is that the minimum waist of the oscillating SW directly 

relates  to  its  maximum  waist  and  period.  However,  since  such  minimum  is  estimated 

 

9

comparable to the light wavelength in the medium (

n/

m68.0

) and the experimental 

data are masked by scattering, based on the paraxial approach (Eqs. (4)-(5)) and the small 

oscillation approximation (Eq. (6)) above we can only state that 

0W  is rather small. While a 

vectorial  treatment  (e.g.  Ref.  [23])  is  needed  when  dealing  with  a  non-paraxiality  figure

  close  to  unity,  to  circumvent  the  limits  of  our  linearized 

analysis  leading  to  Eq.  (6)  we  resorted  to  a  numerical  study  of  light  propagation  while 

solving the basic eqs. (1) and (3) for the nonlinear response of our  voltage-biased LC cell. 

The  study,  carried  out  with  a  split-step beam propagator in the paraxial regime, confirms 

that the SW undergoes oscillations in waist and intensity (up to one order of magnitude), 

with  minimum  values  of  the  order  of  m1m

.  The  numerical  results  ratify  the  widely 

oscillating character of the SW as observed in LC, and prompt for a non-paraxial vectorial 

theory. The latter will be considered elsewhere. 

Conclusions.  Our investigation of an HNNM, employing the nematic liquid crystal E7 in 

the near infrared, demonstrates that highly nonlocal solitons can be excited and propagate 

as  pulsating  beams.  In  spite  of  the  inherent  limits  of  a  paraxial  analysis  in  the  small-

oscillation approximation, the model and the comparison with data indicate that the beam 

dynamics  is  primarily  determined  by  the  ratio  between  input  and  soliton  power,  with 

propagation of narrow-waist SW. The inferred non-paraxiality C, in fact, is more than one 

order  of  magnitude  larger  than  for  self-trapped  beams  in  photorefractive  and  frequency-

doubling  crystals.    In  conclusion,  not  only  nematic  LC  can  be  regarded  as  HNNM  and

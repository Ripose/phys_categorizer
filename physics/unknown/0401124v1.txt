 Helbing  et  al.  recently  made  an  important  step  forward  in  a  theoretical  paper
where a detailed simulation of individuals escaping from a closed room was presented1.
This  work  has  been  rapidly  followed  by  other  theoretical  and  experimental  research2-7

.One  of  the  most  unexpected  phenomena  predicted  by  Helbing  et  al.  is  the  symmetry

breaking in the escape from a room with two identical exits. Here we report experiments

on ants that corroborate this behavior and show that the escape dynamics of ants under

controlled panic can serve as a model to study humans in analogous situations.

In  a  first  type  of  experiments  (Experiment  I),  we  introduced  a  group  of
approximately 80 individuals of the ant species  Atta  insularis8,9  collected  from  natural

nests, into  a circular cell covered by a glass plate with two exits symmetrically situated

at  left  and  right  (Fig.  1a),  which  were  initially  blocked.  Then,  we  opened  the  exits

synchronously,  and  counted  the  number  of  ants  abandoning  the  cell  through  each  exit

until  it  was  empty.  Fig.  1b  shows  a  graph  describing  quantitatively  the  result  of  a

sample  run  of  Experiment  I.  Although  the  difference  in  the  use  of  the  two  doors

eventually  reaches  a  value  of  15  ants  at  a  certain  stage  of  the  run  (roughly

corresponding  to  20%  of  the  total  of  escaping  ants),  it  becomes  clear  that  both  doors

have been used almost symmetrically at the end.

A  very  different  output,  however,  results  from  a  second  kind  of  experiments

(Experiment  II).  In  this  case  everything  takes  place  as  in  Experiment  I,  with  the

important difference that, a few seconds before opening the doors, a dose of 25 or 50  m

l

of an insect repelling liquid is rapidly injected in the cell through a hole in the covering

glass, producing a disk-shaped spot of the substance at the center of the filtering paper

on which the whole setup rests (Fig 1c). A sample output of Experiment II is shown in

Fig.  1d.  Differently  from  Experiment  I,  one  of  the  doors  is  always  much  more  used  to

escape than the other one, which can be described as a symmetry breaking induced by

2

“panic”  associated  to  the  repelling  agent.  In  the  specific  run  depicted  in  Fig  1c,d  the

difference  in  the  use  of  the  two  doors  reached  nearly  50  ants  at  the  end  of  the

experiment  (around  60%  of  the  total  number  of  escaping  ants).  Besides  symmetry

breaking,  a  second  difference  between  Experiment  I  and  II  clearly  seen  in  Fig  b,  d  is

that, in the latter, the total time of escape is much smaller, probably because the “desired
velocity”1 of the ants increases due to the effect of the repelling agent.

Similar results were observed in  several    runs  of  Experiment  I  and  II:  statistics

showed  that  the  difference  in  use  between  the  two  exits  at  the  end  of  the  experiment

were, in average, 12%  –

  3%  for  Experiment  I  and  51%  –

  7%  for  Experiment  II.  The

“preferred exit” in Experiment II was either the left or the right one, with no connection

to any source of assymetry in the experimental setup or to the spatial distribution of ants

inside  the  cell  before  opening  the  doors.  The  experimental  results  were  also  quite

similar when using ants collected from the same  nest,  or  from  different  nests  no  more

than 20 meters apart from each other. They were also similar when repeated on the same

group of ants.

 These results are coherent with the theoretical predictions reported by  Helbing
et al.1 They defined a “panic parameter” which induces individualistic behaviour (each

pedestrian  tends  to  find  an  exit  by  him/herself)  when  low,  and  herding  behaviour

(pedestrians  tend  to  follow  the  crowd)  when  high.  In  their  two-exit  room  simulations,

the authors find that a high value of the panic parameter produces jamming at one of the

doors,  thus  provoking  inefficient  escape.  This  tendency,  illustrated  in  Fig  3a  of

reference 1 is analogous to our Fig 1c, which shows that their panic parameter is related

to the effect of the repelling substance used in our experiments.

 In  spite  of  the  huge  behavioural  differences  between  humans  and  ants  in  normal
conditions10, our experiments suggest that some features of the collective behaviour of

both species can be strikingly similar when escaping under panic.

Figure 1 Escape of ants from a cell with two symmetrically located exits. The cell consists in
an acrylic drum of  80  mm  diameter  and  5  mm  height,  with  two  exits  10  mm  wide  symmetrically
situated  at  left  and  right  positions.  The  drum  rests  on  an  circular  piece  of  filtering  paper  laying
on an horizontal surface, and is covered by a flat glass plate of 3 mm thickness with a hole of 2
mm diameter situated at the  center  of  the  drum.  Approximately  80  ants  from  the  species  Atta
insularis are added with both exits blocked by acrylic bars.  a,  ant  distribution  several  seconds
after opening the exits at  t  =  0.  b,  number of ants abandoning the cell as time goes by.  c,  ant
distribution several seconds after adding 50  m
l  of  an  insect  repellent  fluid  (Citronela,  Labiofam,
Cuba)  though  the  central  hole,  and  then  opening  the  exits  at  t   =   0  (note  a  circular  spot  of
repellent fluid of approximately 20 mm diameter at the centre of the cell). Clogging of ants at the
right exit is clearly visible. d, number of ants abandoning the cell as time goes by, quantitatively
demonstrating  the  symmetry  breaking  when  repellent  is  added.  Small  deviations  from  the  ideal
circular shape of the repellent spot or from its location at the  center of the  setup  did  not  produce
important effects in the experimental output.

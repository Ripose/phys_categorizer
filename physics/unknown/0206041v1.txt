Abstract

- 1 -

Pulsed (30 - 100 µs) nozzle beams have been used to generate helium droplets (<N> = 104-105).

The dependence of the beam intensity and the mean droplet size on the source stagnation pressure

and temperature are studied via mass spectroscopy and laser induced fluorescence  of  embedded

phthalocyanine molecules.  In comparison to a cw beam the pulsed source for the same pressure

and temperature has a factor of 100 higher flux and the droplet sizes are an order of a magnitude

larger.

Studies  involving  ultra  cold,  helium  droplets  have  recently  evolved  into  a  dynamically

developing field of research.1-7  Helium droplets provide a uniquely gentle and very cold matrix

for  high  resolution  spectroscopy.1,4,6    In  this  technique  a  single  molecule  or  a  well-defined

number of molecules are embedded inside microscopic droplets of liquid 4He or 3He consisting of

between <N> = 103 – 105 atoms.2,8,9  The droplets are produced in a continuous (cw) cryogenic

nozzle beam expansion.2,8-11  Embedding is achieved by passing the droplets through a scattering

chamber containing the species of interest.2,12  Closed shell molecules are found to reside in the

interior of the droplets.1,2,4,13  The resonant absorption of light has been detected either by laser

induced  fluorescence  or  via  the  heat  induced  evaporation  of  several  hundreds  of  weakly  bound

helium atoms which leads to a depletion of the droplet beam signal.1,4,6  The special gentle nature

of the matrix has been  particularly  impressively  demonstrated  in  the  infrared  spectra  of  SF6  14-16

and OCS17,18 and other molecules1,4 by the resolution of sharp rotational lines with linewidths of

about 150-300 MHz.  From the intensities of the rotational transitions, temperatures between 0.38

K for pure  4He down to 0.15 K for the droplets with an excess of  3He have been  obtained.14-18

Other  spectroscopic  experiments  indicate  that  4He  droplets  are  superfluid19  and  the  ability  for

molecules  to  rotate  freely  in  helium  droplets  appears  to  be  a  microscopic  manifestation  of

superfluidity.18    Effective  cooling  and  very  narrow  linewidth  of  different  species  in  helium

promote  the  droplets  as  a  useful  experimental  tool  for  the  study  of  large  organic  molecules,6,20

metal  clusters,21-25  and  molecular  complexes.26-33    Simple  chemical  events  in  helium  droplets

such as the recombination of alkali atoms21,22 and the reaction of Ba with N2O34 have also been

documented.  The fluid state  of helium droplets  is  attractive,  because  atoms  and  molecules  can

move inside the droplet unhindered, and thus two or more species embedded independently will

come together.  This opens up the possibility to study ultra low temperature chemical processes in

helium droplets, which may lead to new mechanisms and selectivity.  Pulsed lasers are often used

to induce photochemical reactions for the detailed study of state selective chemical reactions.  On

the other hand, the current cw sources of He droplets give relatively small droplet fluxes of about

1015  –  1016  droplets  sterad-1  s-1.35    Application  of  pulsed  lasers  to  the  cw  beam  obviously

decreases the duty cycle of the experiment  considerably.   Therefore,  the  development of pulsed

helium droplet technique is highly desirable.  This can be mated with other pulsed experimental

techniques  such  as:  infrared  depletion  spectroscopy,  laser-induced  fluorescence  (LIF),  laser

photolysis,  laser  ablation,  and  time-of-flight  (TOF)  mass  spectroscopy,  thus  giving  new

interesting perspectives to the field.

The main reason pulsed helium droplet sources have not yet been introduced is the need for

the pulsed valve to  operate  at  low  temperatures  of  T0  <  25  K.8,9,36,37    In  particular,  the  sealing

poppet of the valve must remain intact, which is difficult to achieve because most polymers crack

at low temperatures.  Operation of the solenoid type pulsed valves down to about T = 100 K have

been previously shown.38,39  Recently, Apkarian and coworkers40 reported on the operation of a

commercial  solenoid type  valve  at  temperature  down  to  T  =  4  K.    This  work  encouraged  us  to

replace  the  cw  nozzle  assembly  in  our  helium  droplet  beam  machine20,27,33,34  with  a  pulsed

nozzle  source  and  test  its  performance.    We  used  similar  Series  99  (General  Dynamics  Valves

Inc.)  valve  equipped  with  copper  sealing  gasket,  which  was  operated  by  the  commercial  IOTA

ONE (General Valves) driver.  The shape of the nozzle channel was modified.  The original 0.25

mm nominal diameter nozzle has a 0.5 mm diameter opening and a constriction in the outlet, see

Fig. 1, insert (a).  This configuration caused heating of the gas cooled during the initial stages of

the  expansion  and  a  concomitant  destruction  of  the  droplets.    As  a  result,  the  intensity  of  the

droplet beam was small and it required a low operating temperature of about T0 = 8 K.  Therefore,

- 3 -

we machined a ∼ 90o conical opening which extends on the full length of the nozzle head of about

3  mm,  see  Fig.  1,  insert  (b).    This  modified  valve  gave  more  than  a  factor  of  10  larger  LIF

intensity and higher operation temperatures (12-20 K).

A  schematic  of  our  experimental  arrangement  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.    In  order  to  cool  the

stainless steel head of the valve, it is encased in a copper assembly, which in turn is attached to

the cold head of a flowing liquid helium cryostat.  In order to improve thermal contact, Apiezon

grease is applied between the copper assembly and the stainless steel nozzle head.  The thermal

link  is  achieved  by  three  10  mm  diameter  copper  rods,  each  8  cm  long.    The  temperature  is

actively  stabilized  via  resistive  heating  of  the  cold  head  and  is  measured  by  two  silicon  diodes

attached to the cold finger and the head of the valve, respectively.  A large temperature difference

of about 4-7 K between the cold finger and the head of the valve indicates an insufficient thermal

link  provided  by  the  present  construction.    We  anticipate  that  the  largest  improvement  can  be

achieved by replacing the original General Valve stainless steel nozzle head with one made from

copper, which has ∼ 10 - 102 larger heat conductivity.

We found that the valve starts opening typically at the driving pulse length of longer than ∆t

= 150 µs, as monitored by the pressure rise in the nozzle chamber and appearance of the droplet

signal  in  LIF-  and  mass-  spectra.    The  maximal  LIF  signal  corresponds  to  an  incomplete  valve

opening at ∆t = 170 – 190 µs.  This was found to vary somewhat upon the change of the poppet

and related reassembling of the pulsed valve.  The valve is opened completely at ∆t ≈  300 µs, as

indicated by about 50 times increase in the gas throughput.  No substantial increase of the peak

droplet signal has been detected in this case.  In part this is due to the distribution of the signal

over the longer pulse.  A longer pulse may also interfere with the gas reflected from the wall of

the nozzle chamber.

The whole cryostat is mounted on an XYZ movable assembly.    At  5  cm  downstream from

the nozzle the central part of  the beam is separated by a 2 mm diameter, 2.5  cm  long  skimmer

(Beam Dynamics).  After a flight distance of 15 cm from the source, the droplets pass through a

2-cm-long heated (T = 450  0C) scattering cell, which contains phthalocyanine.  Gaseous Ar was

admitted to the experimental chamber at pressures  up to  10-5 mbar.   The  laser beam from a cw

diode laser (TUI Laser, ν = 15089.92 cm-1, δν ≈  0.01 cm-1, I = 0.6 mW), suitable to excite the

origin  of  the  S1  (cid:1)  S0  transition  of  phthalocyanine  in  helium  intersects  the  droplet  beam  6  cm

downstream  from  the  pick-up  cell.    In  other  experiments,  an  excimer  pumped  pulsed  dye  laser

was  used  in  the  same  spectral  range  and  laser-induced  fluorescence  (LIF)  was  collected  by  a

photomultiplier (Hamamatsu RS 943-02) at right angles to both the droplet and laser beams.  LIF

signal  was  recorded  by  using  a  digital  oscilloscope  and  a  boxcar  integrator.    An  additional

monitor  was  provided  by  an  on-axis  quadrupole  mass  spectrometer  equipped  with  an  electron

beam ionizer, which was positioned about 110 cm downstream from the droplet source.

The lower panel of Fig. 1 shows typical TOF dependencies of the LIF signal using the cw la-

ser excitation (left) and mass spectrometer signal due to He2

+ ions at m/e = 8 (right), obtained at

P0 = 40 bar and T0 = 14 K.  The strong LIF signal obtained at the laser excitation frequency corre-

sponding  to  the  transition  of  embedded  phthalocyanine  molecules  indicates  the  presence  of  the

droplets in the beam.  The mass spectrometer signal consists of two peaks.  The first is identified

with direct ionization following electron impact. The second peak in the mass spectrum originates

from the production of neutral metastable He2* by electron impact, which remain attached to the

droplets.10,11  The droplets with attached He2*, propagate with the beam velocity to the electron

multiplier, where they create secondary ions.  The time interval between LIF and the first ion peak

permits the  precise determination (± 1  m/s)  of  the  mean  velocity  of  the  droplet  beam  (vb,=  394

- 5 -

m/s,  at  T0  =  14  K).    Upon  decrease  of  the  nozzle  temperature,  the  peaks  shift  to  longer  delay

times, which corresponds to a decrease of the beam velocity, being 330 m/s for T0 = 9 K.

The peak widths of both the LIF (∼32 µs FWHM) and ion (∼46 µs FWHM) signals in Fig. 1

are  much  narrower  than  the  used  length  of  the  driving  pulse  of  ∆t  =  180  µs.    The  pulse  of  the

droplets has a spatial extent of about 1 cm at a distance of 20 cm from the source.  The different

widths of the LIF and ion pulses permit us to estimate the spread of the beam velocity to be ∆v =

4 m/s, which indicates a speed ratio of v/∆v ≈  100.  Similar speed ratios have been obtained in

cw beams for He droplets formed via gas phase expansion.10,11

A comparison of the magnitudes of the ion signals from the pulsed and cw measurements in-

dicates a factor of 100 higher peak flux of the droplets from the pulsed source.  Similar estimates

have been obtained from the LIF intensity measurements.  When the source was operated at 50

Hz (P0 = 20 bar, T0 = 12.5 K) the steady state pressure rise in the nozzle chamber, equipped with

3000  L/s  diffusion  pump,  was  about  5  ×   10-5  mbar,  which  is  ten  times  lower  than  for  the  cw

source at similar P0 and T0.  The heat load, caused by the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the

moving  piston,  at  T0  =  10  K  is  estimated  to  be  5  mJ  per  pulse  at  ∆t  =  180  µs.    Pulse-to-pulse

fluctuations of both LIF and ion signals of less than 5 % were observed, which are comparable or

less  than  the  output  power  fluctuations  of  the  pulsed  lasers.    With  proper  adjustment,  no  leak

through the valve equipped with the Kel-F poppet was detected (nozzle chamber base pressure  2

×  10-7 mbar) at any operating temperature (8-300 K) at stagnation pressure up to 40 bar (the high-

est  pressure  used).    Moreover,  because  of  the  large  nozzle  diameter,  it  is  not  expected  to  be

clogged by frozen impurities, as is often the case with the 5 µm cw nozzle.  No deterioration of

the source performance was noticed after several weeks of operation (∼5 107 pulses) at T0 < 20 K.

The poppet was finally changed after about 108 pulses, when we noticed that the gas load in the

nozzle chamber increased by about a factor of 5.  Moreover about 2 K lower nozzle temperature

was required to obtain similar signal as compared to the fresh poppet.  The disassembled poppet

had a sharp circular, about 0.1 mm deep, groove in the place of its sealing against the nozzle head.

Figure 2 shows the comparison of the LIF spectra of phthalocyanine molecules embedded in

helium droplets measured several months before on the same machine equipped with a cw nozzle

(a)41 versus a pulsed nozzle (b).  The spectrum measured with the pulsed nozzle has about a fac-

tor of 102 higher S/N.  At the energy of the pulsed laser of 10 µJ, the band origin of the transition

is power saturated.  The smooth feature on the blue side of the origin corresponds to the excita-

tion of the phonon wing.19,42  The spectrum corresponds  to  the S1 (cid:1) S0 transition,  which have

previously been studied  in  seeded molecular beams.43  An intense  band  at  λ  =  662.7  nm  is  as-

signed as a band origin of the transition.  This assignment is corroborated by the fact that no sub-

stantial features to the red have been observed.  In comparison some features at the red from the

most intense band have been observed in the free nozzle beam experiments,43 which have been

thought to be due to the shifted band origin, hot bands, van der Waals clusters or due to impuri-

ties.    At  the  droplet  temperature  of  0.38  K,  the  hot  bands  are  expected  to  be  completely  sup-

pressed.  The line assignments to complexes of a chromophore molecule with some other parti-

cles may be easily tested by controlled picking up of the corresponding species.  Indeed, the very

weak  feature  at  λ  =  663.9  nm  is  assigned  to  complexes  of  phthalocyanine  with  N2  molecules,

which have been picked up by the droplet from the residual gas.  The superior quality of the LIF

spectra obtained with the pulsed nozzle permits easy interrogation of diverse van der Waals com-

plexes.  The study of the complexes of phthalocyanine with simple species as H2, N2, Ar and H2O

will be reported separately.44  Sharp lines on the blue side of the origin are due to vibronic transi-

- 7 -

tions of the phthalocyanine molecule.  These transitions have much lower Franck-Condon-Factors

as compared to the band origin, and acquire similar intensity in the LIF spectrum due to the power

saturation of the band origin.  Some vibrational frequencies of the phthalocyanine molecule in the

S1 state are indicated in Fig. 2 in units of wavenumbers.  Similar frequencies in the free molecule

are shown in brackets.  Small shifts of the vibrational frequencies in helium of about 1 cm-1 indi-

cate weak interaction  of the molecule with  the helium  environment.  Vibrational  frequencies  in

helium and linewidths of vibronic bands will be discussed in a forthcoming publication.44

The average number size of the droplets <N> has been obtained from the dependence of the

LIF intensity on the Ar pressure in the experimental chamber.  The phthalocyanine pick-up effi-

ciency was kept  small so  that  less than 10%  of  the droplets in the  whole  studied range  of  <N>

were doped.  An additional pick-up of Ar atoms results in the formation of complexes of Ar with

phthalocyanine molecules within the droplet, whose absorption frequency is red shifted by 16 cm-

1.  Thus, the LIF intensity due to bare phthalocyanine  molecule, ILIF, decreases with Ar  number

density [Ar] as:12

σ = c ×  <N>2/3,

ILIF(Ar) = ILIF(0) exp(-σ ×  [Ar] ×  L ×  F(vrel, vb)),

(1)

where: σ is the pick-up cross section, c is a proportionality constant, [Ar] is the number density of

Ar atoms, L = 16 cm is the length of the Ar pick-up region before the droplet beam crosses the

laser beam, F(vrel, vb) ≈  vrel/vb is a correction factor to account for the finite thermal velocity of

the Ar atoms, vrel is an average relative collision velocity of the argon atoms and helium droplets

and c is a proportionality constant.  In order to account for the effects of the droplet size distribu-

tion,8,9 and radial density distribution within a droplet,8 the mean droplet size obtained from eq.

(1) was calibrated against measurements with a cw nozzle, giving the constant c in eq. (1).  For P0

= 20 bar and T0 = 11 and 12 K the direct beam deflection measurements gave <N> = 1.8× 104 and

1.4× 104  atoms,  respectively.8    The  decrease  of  σ  upon  pick  up  of  the  phthalocyanine  molecule

was ignored in the pulsed experiments due to the large size of the droplets.  In the cw calibration

experiments Ar atoms were picked up prior to the phthalocyanine molecules.

Figure  3a  shows  the  temperature  dependencies  of  the  average  droplet  size  at  different

indicated  values  of  P0.    The  results  for  the  cw  5µm  nozzle  from  Refs.8,9  are  shown  for

comparison.   Figure  3b  shows  similar  dependencies  of  the  droplet´s  flux,  Φ(P0,  T0),  which  was

estimated from the peak value of the ILIF.  In these measurements the frequency of the diode laser

was adjusted to yield the maximum intensity of the band origin for each experimental condition.

The shape of the spectrum of the band origin depends weakly on the droplet size in the relevant

range of 2× 104 – 105 atoms.41  Thus relation

ILIF ∝ Φ(P0, T0) ×  σ/ vb,

(2)

approximately holds.  The cross section σ (see eq. (1)) takes into account the dependence of the

pick up probability on the droplet size.

It is instructive to compare the measured droplet size dependencies with those obtained for

the cw expansion through a thin walled (2 µm)45 nozzle with 5 µm diameter.8,9

i.  

Droplets having 104-105 atoms are produced in a pulsed expansion at temperatures which

are 5 to 10 K higher than the cw nozzle at the same P0.

- 9 -

ii. 

Droplets  obtained  with  the  pulsed  nozzle  are  about  an  order  of  a  magnitude  larger  than

those obtained with the cw nozzle at similar expansion parameters at T0 > 10 K, P0 = 20 bar.

iii. 

Average  droplet  sizes  <N>  show  strikingly  different  behaviour  as  a  function  of  nozzle

temperature.    Whereas  in  the  case  of  cw  expansion  the  size  of  the  droplets  increases  gradually

with  decreasing  temperature,  the  formation  of  droplets  in  the  pulsed  expansion  sets  in  sharply.

These droplets are already quite large (<N> =2-5× 104) and there is no evidence for smaller drop-

lets  at  higher  temperature.    The  He2

+  ions  appear  in  the  mass  spectra  at  slightly  higher  nozzle

temperature (1-2 K) as compared with the LIF signal.  Beyond the threshold the droplets size first

remains unchanged for high expansion pressures (P0 = 20 and 40 bar), or even drops suddenly for

P0 = 6 bar.  With the following decrease in T0 the mean droplet size increases, saturates however

at low temperature, or even drops for the highest pressure P0 = 40 bar.

iv. 

There is no indication for a transition to a supercritical expansion10,11 which corresponds

to  liquefaction  of  helium  within  the  nozzle  followed  by  fragmentation  of  the  liquid  on  larger

droplets.    This  regime  of  the  cw  expansion  is  characterized  by  very  rapid  rise  of  the  average

droplet size from 104 to 106 atoms within a temperature interval of less than 0.5 K below some

threshold temperature, e.g., T ≈  10 K for P0 = 20 bar and T ≈  12 K for P0 = 40 bar, see Fig. 3.

This shape of the temperature dependence makes it difficult to exploit this range  of the droplet

size in the cw expansion which may be desirable for some particular experiments.  For example,

the narrowest lines and largest S/N in LIF spectra of large molecules are obtained for <N> ∼ 105.

This range is also ideally suited for hosting large molecules and growing large clusters having up

to 100 entities inside helium droplets.

Both i and ii are in agreement with the larger diameter of the nozzle.  The existing scaling

laws46 predict approximately linear increase of the scaling parameter with the nozzle size, which

-  -

10

is in qualitative agreement with the present observations.  However, it is not clear whether these

scalings can be applied to the poorly defined expansion geometry of the pulsed nozzle.  The ex-

istence of the sharp onset of formation of large droplets may indicate the threshold for nucleation

in the expanding gas.  Because there are insufficient nucleation centers at high temperature, they

grow into large droplets in the following stages of the gas expansion.  Note that similar threshold

dependence has been observed for formation of the 3Hen droplets in the case of cw expansion,16,47

where the formation of the nucleation centers is hampered by instability of small clusters, having

n < 29.48  With further decrease of the nozzle temperature the number of nucleation centers in-

creases rapidly, which causes the heating of the expanding gas and decrease of the mean droplet

size.  Droplet size increases with further decrease of the nozzle temperature, until the size and the

number of the droplets become limited by the considerable amount of gas condensed into drop-

lets.  This scenario is in accord with the behaviour of the droplet flux, which rises sharply at the

threshold, see Fig. 3b. The leveling out and drop of the droplet size and flux at higher expansion

pressures  may  indicate  the  onset  of  scattering  under  these  experimental  conditions.    The  large

difference of the droplet size dependencies on the expansion parameters between the pulsed and

cw sources may be related to the larger dimension of the pulsed nozzle and concomitant longer

residence time of the gas in the expansion region.  Due to the incomplete opening of the nozzle

the actual expansion zone is not circular but has a form of a ring, having a width of about 20-100

µm and diameter of about 0.5 mm.  The length of this circular channel is estimated to be about 0.5

mm, i.e., ∼ 250 times longer than of the cw ones.

In  summary,  the  first  generation  of  pulsed  beams  of  helium  droplets  is  reported  and  the

performance of the source is studied.   In the  future we  are planning  to upgrade  this experiment

with other pulsed experimental techniques, such as infrared depletion spectroscopy, laser photoly-

- 11 -

sis, laser ablation, and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectroscopy, which will considerably increase

the versatility of the technique.  One of the future goals is to achieve the production of droplets

having about 5 ×  103 helium atoms, i.e., the range, which gives the best S/N for depletion spec-

troscopy.15  Another important continuation of this work is to explore the operation of the valve

in the regime of full opening as well as using larger nozzle diameters.  An additional increase of

the beam intensity by a factor of 10 – 100 is easy to imagine.

We  measured  the  flux  of  helium  droplets  at  the  beam  axis  for  the  continuous  expansion

through a 5 microne circular nozzle via the transport of the embedded Ar atoms from the pick-up

chamber to the mass spectrometer chamber, similar as described in Ref. [12].  For P0 = 20 bar

fluxes of 2 1015, 5 1015, and 6 1015 droplets/sterad s have been obtained for the nozzle tempera-

tures of T0 = 10, 11 and 12 K, respectively.  These expansion conditions correspond to the mean

size of the droplets of <N> = 5 104, 1.8 104, and 1.4 104, respectively. .

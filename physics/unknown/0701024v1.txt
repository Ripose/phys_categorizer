The generalized oscillator strengths (GOS’s) of discrete excitations np → nd, both dipole (L = 1)
and octupole (L = 3) are studied, the latter for the ﬁrst time. We demonstrate that although
the relevant transitions in the same atom are closely located in energy, the dependence of their
GOS’s on the momentum transfer squared q2
, is remarkably diﬀerent, viz. the GOS’s corresponding
to L = 3 have at least one extra maximum as a function of q2
and dominate over those of the
L = 1, starting from about q2 = 1.5 a.u. The calculations were performed in the one particle
Hartree-Fock approximation and with account of many-electron correlations via the Random Phase
Approximation with Exchange. The GOS’s are studied for values of q2

up to 30 a.u.

INTRODUCTION

Here we consider the lowest energy optically allowed transitions for the outer np subshells of the noble gas atoms
np → nd and np → (n + 1)s. The former series of transitions in Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, namely np → nd can be
dipole and octupole, while the latter can only be a pure dipole. The essential feature of the levels considered is
that those with the same conﬁgurations np → nd but diﬀerent total angular momentum L, L = 1 and L = 3, are
closely located and hardly separable in existing experiments. This means that they will be excited by electron (or
other charged particle) impact simultaneously, but decay via photon emission separately; the decay of the octupole
excitation being about eight orders of magnitude slower than the dipole. As a result, soon after excitation of a gas
volume by incoming charged particles, only octupole levels will survive. Therefore, separate calculations of octupole
GOS’s are of importance and interest, presenting the probability of populating and studying the long living excited
levels.

The generalized oscillator strength, introduced by Bethe [1] and reviewed by Inokuti [2], characterizes fast electron
inelastic scattering.
It manifests directly the atomic wave functions and the dynamics of scattering. Since then,
the GOS has received attention from a variety of perspectives: determination of the correct spectral assignment
[3], exploring the excitation dynamics [4], probing the intricate nature of the valence-shell and inner-shell electron
excitation [5], investigation of the inﬂuence of the angular resolution and pressure eﬀects on the position and amplitude
of the GOS minima [6], investigation of the GOS ratio [7] and various correlation eﬀects [8-11], as well as multiple
minima [12].

One of the most important utilities of the GOS concept in the limit q2 → 0 is in the determination of optical oscillator
strengths (OOS’s) from absolute diﬀerential cross sections (DCS’s) [13-16]. Implicit in this is the extrapolation of the
measured data through sometimes the unphysical region [17]. The limiting behavior of the GOS as q2 → 0 has been
a subject of continuing interest because of the diﬃculty of measuring reliably the electron DCS’s for atoms, ions and
molecules at and near zero scattering angles [3,14,18]. This diﬃculty still plagues measurements of the DCS’s [19,
20], including the most recent measurements of the DCS’s [21, 22]. Thus a thorough understanding of the behavior
of the GOS’s near q2 = 0 is imperative to guide measurements.

To place the current investigation of the GOS’s for the np − nd and np − ns transitions in Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe in
perspective, it is important to highlight some signiﬁcant new manifestations that have been uncovered in the recent
studies of correlation eﬀects in the GOS’s for atomic transitions:

1) Recently, GOS’s for monopole, dipole and quadrupole transitions of the noble gas atoms have been investigated
in both Hartree-Fock (HF) and Random Phase Approximation with Exchange (RPAE) approximations as functions
of q and the energy transferred, ω [8]. There it was found that electron correlations, both intra-shell and inter-shell
are important in the GOS’s for all values of q and ω investigated and that the variation of the GOS’s with q and ω
is characterized by maxima and minima, arising entirely from many-electron correlations. These results have been
used to understand and interpret [23, 24] the ﬁrst experimental observation of the absolute GOS for the nondipole
Ar 3p − 4p transition [5]. Of great signiﬁcance is that the calculated GOS’s for discrete transitions permitted the
determination of their multipolarity quite reliably [10]. The interpretation is of particular interest for nondipole
transitions since they cannot be observed in photon absorption. Of even greater importance and accomplishment in

the recent measurement of the GOS’s for the valence-shell excitation of Ar is the separate measurement of the electric
monopole and quadrupole of the GOS’s for the valence-shell excitation of Ar [25].

2) For the outer and intermediate shells of Xe, Cs and Ba, correlations have been discovered to produce impressive
manifestations of intra-doublet interchannel interaction [26], yielding new structures in nondipole parameters and
GOS’s [9]. GOS results for Xe, Cs and Ba demonstrated the leveraging role of the spin-orbit interaction, viz. the
strong interaction between components of the spin-orbit doublet of the 3d electrons in Cs, Ba and Xe. This leads to
the appearance of an additional maximum in the GOS for the 3d5/2 sub-shell, due to the action of the 3d3/2 electrons.
The inter-doublet correlations were found to be very important in the monopole, dipole and quadrupole transitions.
3) Generalized oscillator strengths for monopole, dipole and quadrupole transitions in the negative ions I − and
Si− have been investigated to assess the extent of importance of correlations [27].
It was found that the GOS’s
for monopole and dipole transitions, are generally characterized by two distinct sets of maxima as functions of ω,
being most pronounced for the dipole transitions. For the negative ions, there are two interesting and signiﬁcant
peculiarities. Firstly, contrary to the well-known behavior of atomic transitions, the limit of the GOS approaches
zero as q2 → 0 for the dipole transition. Secondly, in both the monopole and the quadrupole transitions, the GOS
corresponding to q = 2 a.u. starts being zero at threshold and becomes dominant beyond about ω = 6 Ry.

II. THEORY

In this paper, we consider a relatively simple case where the transition energy can be speciﬁed almost entirely by
the one-electron nomenclature, namely by the principal quantum number and angular momentum of the exciting
electron in its initial and ﬁnal states, nl and n(cid:2)l(cid:2), respectively and by the total angular momentum of the excitation
L. Both the energies ωnl,n(cid:1)l(cid:1) and the GOS’s are aﬀected by the multi-electron correlations, since the one-electron
approximation is very often not accurate enough, even for qualitative, not to mention quantitative, description. With
the above in mind, we have performed calculations both in the one particle Hartree-Fock approximation and with
account of many-electron correlations via the RPAE [28].

The RPAE has proved to be very eﬀective in describing the photoionization cross sections and GOS’s [8,23,24,28-30]
including rather delicate features of the dipole and nondipole angular anisotropy parameters of photoelectrons, where
impressive manifestations of electron correlations were recently observed in good accord with both experiment and
calculations (see e.g. [26, 31-36]).

The theoretical consideration in this paper of dipole and octupole excitations is similar to that of quadrupole and
monopole excitations in [23,24]. However for the convenience of the reader and for better understanding of the results
we repeat here the main points of consideration of GOS in general and in the one-electron HF frame and with account
of correlations in the RPAE frame. All necessary formulas are also presented.

One speciﬁc feature of the considered in this pasper discrete excitations require special attentin. Namely, in Kr there
are two closely located dipole excitations: 4p-4d energy is 0.93330 Ry, while 4p-6s energy is 0.93403 Ry and 4p-5d
energy is 0.98429 Ry, while 4p-7s energy is 0.98479 Ry. As to the method implemented in the computing program
in [38] and used in [23,24], it is suitable for the case of a single relatively isolated discrete excitation, for which all
other act as perturbation. In our case the closely located levels are distorbing each other very strong. Therefore the
corresponding interaction has to be taken into account accurately enough.

The inelastic scattering cross sections of fast electrons or other charged particles incident upon atoms or molecules
are expressed via the GOS G(ω, q) [1,37] which is a function of the energy ω and the momentum transferred q to the
target in the collision process. The GOS is deﬁned as [1] (atomic units are used throughout this paper)

Gf i(ω, q) =

ψ∗
f ( (cid:15)r1, ..., (cid:15)rN )exp(i(cid:15)q · (cid:15)rj)ψi( (cid:15)r1, ..., (cid:15)rN )d (cid:15)r1...d (cid:15)rN |2

2ω
q2 | ΣN

j=1

(cid:1)

where N is the number of atomic electrons and ψi,f are the atomic wave functions in the initial and ﬁnal states with
energies Ei and Ef , respectively, and ω = Ef − Ei. Because the projectile is assumed to be fast, its wave functions
are plane waves and its mass M enters the GOS indirectly, namely via the energy and momentum conservation law

p2
2M

−

((cid:15)p − (cid:15)q)2
2M

= ω

Here (cid:15)p is the momentum of the projectile. It follows from the GOS deﬁnition Eq. (1) that when q = 0 the GOS
coincides with the OOS or is simply proportional to the photoionization cross section (see for example [37]), depending
upon whether the ﬁnal state is a discrete excitation or belongs to the continuous spectrum. The energy ω enters the
GOS either via a factor in Eq. (1) or indirectly, via the energy Ef of the ﬁnal state | f >.

where φf,i((cid:15)r) = Rnf,iYlf,i,mf,i (θ(cid:11)r, ϕ(cid:11)r)χsf,i are the HF one-electron wave functions with their radial, angular and spin
parts, respectively, jL(qr) is the spherical Bessel function, PL(cosϑ) is the Legendre polynomial and cosϑ = (cid:15)q · (cid:15)r/qr.
The excitation energy of the i → f transition is denoted as ωf i. The principal quantum number, the angular
momentum, its projection and spin quantum numbers of the initial i and ﬁnal f states are denoted by nf,i, lf,i, mf,i
and sf,i, respectively.

To take into account of many-electron correlations in the RPAE the following system of equations was solved

< f |AL(q, ωR

Here ≤ F (> F ) denotes occupied (vacant) HF states, *n are the one-electron HF energies, η → +0 and nk = l(0)
for k ≤ F (> F ); < nf |U |ki >L=< nf |V |ki >L − < nf |V |ik >L is the L component of the matrix elements of the
Coulomb inter-electron interaction V . It is seen that the system of equations for each total angular momentum of
an excitation L is separate. The procedure of solving this equation is described in details in [28, 38]. Note that the
excitation energy of the i → f transition in RPAE ωR
f i is diﬀerent from the HF value ωf i = *f − *i. The procedure of
calculating ωR
f i is also described in [28, 38].

A relation similar to Eq. (3) determines the GOS’s in RPAE GL

f i)|i > |2

Here < f | and |i > are the ﬁnal and initial HF states, respectively. Using these formulas the GOS’s were calculated
for dipole L = 1 and octupole L = 3 components.

The operator of the interaction between fast charged particles and atomic electrons can also be represented in
another form than ˆA(q) = ˆAr(q) ≡ exp(i(cid:15)q · (cid:15)r). This is anologous to the case of photoionization and can be called
length form. The other one is similar to the velocity form in photoionization and looks like [37]

ˆAv(ω, q) = [exp(iq · r)(q · ∇ − q ·

←−∇)exp(iq · r)]

where the upper arrow in

←−∇ in Eq. (6) implies that the function standing to the left is being operated on.

For the speciﬁc case considered in this paper the explicit HF energies are ωnp→nd,(n+1)s ≡ *nd,(n+1)s − *np with
*np, *nd and *(n+1)s being the HF one-electron energies. Rnp(r), Rnd(r) and R(n+1)s(r) are the radial parts of the
one-electron wave functions in the HF approximation and L is the total angular momentum of the excitation, where
in our case L = 1 or 3, n = 2; 3; 4 and 5 for Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, respectively. Symbolically, the RPAE equations can
be presented as [28,38]

ˆT = ˆt + ˆT ˆχU

(cid:1)

tL
np→nd,(n+1)s(q) ≡< np | ˆt | nd, (n + 1)s) >=

Rnp(r)jL(qr)Rnd,(n+1)s(r)dr,

U is the Coulomb interelectron interaction, and

ˆχ = ˆ1/(ω − ω(cid:2) + iγ) − ˆ1/(ω + ω(cid:2))

with γ → 0 and ω being the excitation energy parameter of the relevant discrete excitation, while ω(cid:2) is the energy of
any other, including the considered discrete or continuous spectrum excitation of another electron, which is excited by
the incoming electron. Its interaction via the potential U leads to the excitation of a given atom under consideration.
The RPAE values for the GOS’s Fnp→nd,(n+1)s(q) are connected to the matrix elements of ˆT similar to the connection
of fnp→nd,(n+1)s ,the HF GOS values, with ˆt. However, a complication arises for discrete excitations. This results

from the fact that one of the intermediate discrete excitation energies consistent with the energy of the excitation of
the level under investigation and the corresponding element of ˆχ becomes inﬁnite. To circumvent this singularity an
eﬀective interaction matrix has to be created [28,38]:

where ˆχ(cid:2) excludes only a single term, with one of the transitions ω(cid:2) = ωnp→nd,(n+1)s, from summation over all
intermediate states [see (4)]. Then the total matrix of the eﬀective interaction ˆΓ is determined by a simple expression:

(cid:2)(cid:3)

Γ = U + U ˆχ(cid:2)

ˆΓ =

Γ(ω − ωnp→nd,(n+1)s −

This is correct only if the interaction between two adjaisent levels is weak enough and can be accounted for

perturbatively. Then instead of Eq. (3), one can arrive at the following expression for ˆT

(cid:2)(cid:3)

(cid:2)(cid:3)

With the help of Eq. (11) we derive the GOS value in RPAE as

Here Znp→nd,(n+1)s is the spectroscopic factor of the discrete excitation level.
The equations (10)-(14) determine the RPAE values for both the GOS’s and the discrete excitation energies, while

Eq.(3) gives the HF GOS, represented simply as fnp→nd,(n+1)s with the appropriate ωf i used.

However, as it was mentioned above, at least in Kr one has two very close levels. In this case one had at ﬁrst to

introduce an auhilary matrix of eﬀective interelectron interaction ˆΓαβ that is a solution of equation similar to (10)

Γ = U + U ˆχ”

Γ

with ˆχ” that excludes two so-called "time-forward" terms, i.e. those with energy factors ˆ1/(ω − ω” + iγ), where ω” are
the energies of two strongly interacting transtions. In our case these are terms with ω” = ω4p→4d and ω” = ω4p→6s
or ω” = ω4p→5d and ω” = ω4p→7s. However, the relation that determines ˆΓ, is not that simple as (11): it is instead
of being an simple algebraic became a 2 × 2 matrix equation.

III. RESULTS OF CALCULATIONS

The calculations were performed numerically using the programs and procedures described in [38] and for the case
of Kr corrected with accord of the formulas (16-18). The results of the calculations are presented in the Table 1 and
the ﬁgures 1-8 below. It is important to bear in mind that at small q2(q2 → 0) the dipole GOS is absolutely dominant,
since the GOS dipole component is non zero at q2 → 0, corresponding to the OOS. However, with increasing q2 the
situation very fast changes considerably and in some cases even dramatically, since f L=1
np→nd,(n+1)s(q) rapidly decreases
with increasing q2 while f L=3
np→nd,(n+1)s(q) has to
reach its maximum with subsequent decrease. The q2- dependence of f proved to be more complicated, exhibiting
maxima for all the cases considered.

np→nd,(n+1)s(q) rapidly increases as q2 at least for small q. Then f L=3

Note that the results for the dipole components of the 3p → 3d level in Ar were obtained earlier [23]. Here our
previous results are complemented by those from the octupole contributions, calculated for the ﬁrst time, to our
knowledge.

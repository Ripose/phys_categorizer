Abstract 
 
First, classes of Markov processes that scale exactly with a Hurst exponent 
H  are  derived  in  closed  form.  A  special  case  of  one  class  is  the  Tsallis 
density,  advertised  elsewhere  as  ‘nonlinear  diffusion’  or  ‘diffusion  with 
nonlinear feedback’.  But the Tsallis model is only one of a very large class 
of  linear  diffusion  with  a  student-t  like  density.  Second,  we  show  by 
stochastic  calculus  that  our  generalization  of  the  Black-Scholes  partial 
differential equation (pde) for variable diffusion coefficients is equivalent to 
a Martingale in the risk neutral discounted stock price. Previously, this was 
proven  for  the  restricted  case  of  Gaussian  logarithmic  returns  by  Harrison 
and Kreps,  but we prove it here for large classes of empirically useful and 
theoretically interesting returns models where the diffusion coefficient D(x,t)  
depends  on  both  logarithmic  returns  x  and  time  t.  Finally,  we  prove  that 
option  prices  blow  up  if  fat  tails  in  returns  x  are  included  in  the  market 
distribution.  

 
1. Markov processes with scaling densities 
 
1.1  Hurst exponents 
 
Hurst  exponents  are  normally  asumed  to  imply  auto-correlations  that 
describe long term  memory. We will explain why H≠1/2 is consistent both 
with Markov processes, which by construction have no autocorrelations, and 
also  with  fractional  Brownian  motion,  where  the  autocorrelations  extend 
over  arbitrarily  long  nonoverlapping  time  intervals.  Therefore,  the  Hurst 
exponent taken alone cannot be used to determine the existence of long term 
memory. 
 
We  begin  with  the  fact  that  a  Hurst  exponent  H  describes,  without  other 
assumptions [1], the scaling of the variance of a stochastic process x(t),  
 

where c is a constant. Here, the initial point in the time series is assumed to 
be xo=0 at t=0. Initially, we limit our analysis to a drift-free process so that 
<x>=0.  
 
To obtain variance scaling (1) we need a probability density f(x,t) that scales 
as [2] 
 

  (1) 

.    (2) 

 
Up to this point we have not assumed any underlying stochastic dynamics. 
Our  discussion  so  far  is  consistent  with  both  fractional  Brownian  motion 
(fBm) [1] and a Markov process [2]. 
 
 
1.2 Markov processes with scaling  
 
A  Markov  process  [3,4]  is  a  stochastic  process  without  memory,  without 
autocorrelations  in  x(t).  Any  stochastic  differential  equation  (‘Langevin 
equation’) 
 

    (3) 

  ! "2=x2f(x,t)dx=ct2H#$$%  ! f(x,t)=t"HF(u);u=x/tH  ! dx=R(x,t)+D(x,t)dB(t) 
with  functions  R(x,t)  and  D(x,t)  (as  opposed  to  functionals)  as  drift  and 
diffusion coefficients generates a Markov process [2,5,6]. For the time being 
we  take  R=0.  B(t)  is  the  usual  Wiener  process,  and  Ito  calculus  [5]  is 
assumed. 
 
From the sde (3) we can also calculate the variance as 
 

 
so that diffusion coefficient  scaling  
 

,    (1b) 

   (4) 

 
follows from combining (1) and (2) with (1b). 
 
The sde (3) with R=0 generates the Green function g of the Fokker-Planck 
pde [2,7] 
 

,    (5) 

 
which can be rewritten to include a constant drift rate R by replacing x by x-
Rt  [8].  Drifts  of  the  form  R(x,t)=µ-D(x,t)/2  do  not  scale,  and  arbitrary 
choices of R(x,t) also do not scale. Scale invariance is generally broken by a 
drift rate depending on x.  
 
We  restrict  ourselves  here  to  the  case  where  g(x,0;t,0)=f(x,t)  because  that 
only  these  solutions  exhibit  exact  scaling  (1,2,4),  and  also  because  the 
density f(x,t) is what one obtains directly from histograms of finance market 
returns data [7,9]. The full Green function g(x,xo;t,to) is needed in principle 
for  risk  neutral  option  pricing  [7]  but  doesn’t  scale  [2]  and  also  can’t  be 
calculated in closed analytic form when D(x,t) depends on both x and t.  
 
Inserting the scaling forms (2) and (3) into the pde (5), then we obtain [2]

.       (7) 

 
This generalizes our earlier results [10] to include H≠1/2.  
 
Next, we study the class of quadratic diffusion coefficients 
  

 
This choice generates the two parameter class of student-t- like densities 
 

.    (8) 

   (9) 

 
with  fat  tail  exponent  µ=2+2H/εd’(ε)
,  where  H  and  ε  are  independent 
parameters to be determined empirically. So we now know where student-t-
like  distributions  come  from  dynamically.  With  d’(ε)=1  we  obtain  the 
generalization  of  our  earlier  prediction  [10]  to  arbitrary  H,  0<H<1,  with 
µ=2+2H/ε.  In  that  case,  we  can  generate  all  fat  tail  exponents  2<µ<∞ 
(2<µ<7 is observed [11]), and also obtain a finite variance scaling as σ2=ct2H 
whenever µ>3. For large u this model fits the fat tails in financial data for all 
times t [12]. We can generate both the exponential  middle  [12] and the fat 
tailed extremes systematically by using a diffusive model. 
 
 
3.3 H≠1/2, taken alone, does not imply aucorrelations 
 
Consider the Markov process (3) in its integrated form 
 

   (10) 

 
Even  when  scaling  (1,2,4)  holds  with  H≠1/2  ,  then  there  can  be  no 
autocorrelation  in  the  increments  Δx(t,t-Τ)=x(t)-x(t-T),  Δx(t,t+T)=x(t+T)-
x(t)  over  the  two  nonoverrlapping  time  intervals  [2].  If  the  nonstationary 
stochastic  process  x(t)  has  nonstationary  increments,  meaning  that  x(t+T)-
x(t)≠x(T)  depends  both  on  Τ  and  t,  then  H≠1/2  does  not  imply 

  ! F(u)=CD(u)e"2Hudu/D(u)#  ! D(u)=" d (#)(1+#u2)  ! F(u)=" C (1+#u2)$1$H/#" d (#)  ! "x(t,t+T)=D(x(s),s)tt+T#dB(s)autocorrelations  [2].    As  always  with  stochastic  equations,  equality  is 
understood  as  ‘equality  in  distribution’.  The  argument  that  H≠1/2  implies 
long time correlations fails for Markov processes (and for the finance market 
as  well,  to  zeroth  order)  precisely  because  the  stochastic  integral  (10)  with 
the  scaling 
(1,2,4)  describes  a  nonstationary  process  with 
nonstationary increments whenever H≠1/2:  
 

forms 

 . (11) 

 
Direct calculation of the autocorrelation function [2] shows that it vanishes 
independently  of  the  value  of  H.  When  the  increments  are  nonstationary, 
then performing a correct data analysis nontrivial [12]. 
 
To obtain the long time autocorrelations of fractional Brownian 
motion (fBm) [1] two independent conditions must be satisfied: (i) the 
time series must have stationary increments, x(t+T)-x(t)=x(T), and (ii) 
the variance must scale, <x2(t)>=ct2H [2]. In the literature these two 
separate requirements are often confused together into a soup. 
 
 
3.8 The Tsallis Model is not generated by ‘nonlinear diffusion’ 
 
Many papers have been written claiming that the Tsallis density is generated 
by both a ‘nonlinear Fokker-Planck pde’ and by a Langevin eqn. [13-17] as 
well,  but  apparently  none  of  the  authors  noted  the  following:  a  Langevin 
eqn. with ordinary functions as drift and diffusion coefficients is Markovian, 
generates  a  linear  diffusion  pde,  the  usual  Fokker-Planck  pde  [2,4,5].  The 
Green  function,  or  condidional  probability  density,  is  required  to  define  a 
Markov  process  [4,5,7],  but  a  nonlinear  diffusion  eqn.  has  no  Green 
function.  So,  either  the  Tsallis  model  is  nonlinear  but  has  no  underlying 
Langevin  description,  or  else  the  Tsallsi  density  is  a  Markov  process  in  a 
nonlinear disguise. We can clear up the confusion. 
 
Given the Tsallis density [17] 
 

  ! x(t+T)"x(t)=D(x(s),s)0t+T#dB(s)"D(x(s),s)0t#dB(s)=D(x(s),s)tt+T#dB(s)=sH"1/2D(u)tt+T#dB(s)=s+tH"1/2D(x/s+tH)0T#dB(s)$x(T)     (12) 

 
with c a constant then the fat tail exponent, f(x,t) ≈ x-m for x>>1, is µ=2/(q-
1), and H=1/(3-q). The Tsallis model definition [17] 

 
with H=1/(3-q), where  
 

 (14) 

 
yields 
 

 
which we can rewrite as 
 

 (11) 

    (15) 

    (16) 

 
To  compare  (11,16)  with  (9,8),  we  need  only  write  ε=(q-1)/C2(q)  and 
d’(ε)=d(q). Our Fokker-Planck-generated density f(x,t) given by (8) reduces 
exactly to (14) if   H=1/(3-q). This means that the Tsallis density fq actually 
derives from the linear diffusion pde 
 

   (17) 

 
so that the so-called ‘nonlinear Fokker-Planck eqn.’ [13-17] is really a linear 
pde disguised superficially as a nonlinear one.  
 
A similar nonlinear disguise is possible for our entire two-parameter student-
t-like class solutions (9), because for quadratic diffusion D(u)=d’(ε)(1+εu2), 
the  solution  of  the  Fokker-Planck  pde  (5)  is  a  power  of  the  diffusion 
coefficient, F(u)=CD(u)-1-H/εd’(ε). All of these solutions also trivially satisfy a 
nonlinear pde, but rewriting (19) as a nonlinear pde in the case of quadratic 
diffusion  superficially  masks  the  real  Markovian  nature  of  the  dynamics. 
Because  the  Tsallis  density  (11)  describes  Markovian  dynamics,  it  cannot 

  ! fq(x,t)=(c(2"q)(3"q))"Ht"H(1+(q"1)x2/C2(q)t2H)1/(1"q)  ! C(q)=c(q"1)/2(3"q)((2"q)(3"q))H  ! Dq(x,t)=fq1"q(x,t)  ! Dq(x,t)=(c(2"q)(3"q))2H"1t2H"1(1+(q"1)x2/C2(q)t2H)  ! Dq(x,t)=d(q)t2H"1(1+((q"1)/C2(q))u2)=t2H"1Dq(u)  ! "f"t=12"2(Dqf)"x2describe long-time correlated signals like fBm. Here, H=1/(3-q)≠1/2 merely 
signals that the increments x(t) are nonstationary.  
 
Next,  we  explain  why  nonlinear  diffusion  would  be  inconsistent  with  risk 
neutral option pricing: the Green function for the Black-Scholes pde solves 
our  market  Fokker-Planck  pde  (5)  with  a  nonscaling  drift  term  R(x,t)=µ-
D(x,t)/2 included [7,9]. 
 
 
2. Pricing options via Martingales 
 
2.2 The Black-Scholes PDE and Kolmogorov’s First PDE 
 
With the transformation 

  (18) 

 
   
 
the generalized Black-Scholes pde (see [18] for the original Gaussian returns 
model)  in the returns variable [7,9]  
 

    (19) 

 
becomes  

 

 

. 

   
 
This  is  a  very  beautiful  result.  This  pde  is  exactly  the  backward  time 
equation,  or  first  Kolmogorov  equation  [3],  corresponding  to  the  Fokker-
Planck pde (the second Kolmogorov equation) 
 
 

(20) 

(21) 
 
 for  the  market  Green  function  of  returns g,  if  we  choose µ=r  in  the  latter 
[7].  With  the  choice  µ=r  then  both  pdes  are  solved  by  the  same  Green 

 

  ! u=er(t"T)v  ! ru(x,t)="u(x,t)"t+(r#D(x,t)/2)"u(x,t)"x+D(x,t)2"2u(x,t)"x2  ! 0="v"t+(r#D(x,t)/2)"v"x+D(x,t)2"2v"x2  ! "g(x,t;xo,to)"t=#((µ#D(x,t)/2)"g(x,t;xo,to)"x)+D(x,t)2"2g(x,t;xo,to)"x2function g, so that no information is provided by solving the option pricing 
pde  (19)  that  is  not  already  contained  in  the  Green  function  of  the  Market 
Fokker-Planck  equation  (21).  The  Fokker-Planck  operator  cannot  be  made 
self-adjoint  via  boundary  conditions,  the  forward  and  backward  time  pdes 
are adjoints of each other [3]. 
 
To be explicit, according to the theory of backward time integration [19,20] 
we must understand (20) as 
 

 (22) 

 

 

where v(xo,to)=g(x,t;xo,to) solves the Fokker-Planck pde (21) in (x,t). This is 
like  physics:  everything  can  be  calculated  when  one  knows  the  Green 
function [7,21]. 
 
We can, e.g., use the market Green function g to price calls risk neutrally as 
 

, 

(23) 

 
where xT=lnpT/pc and x=lnp/pc where p is the price at present time t (T is the 
expiration time, and K is the strike price)  and pc is  the consensus price, or 
‘value’ [10,22].  
 
It’s easy to check that the diffusive contribution D(x,t) to the drift R(x,t)=r-
D(x,t)/2  breaks  Hurst  exponent  scaling.  However,  option  pricing  is  not  a 
strong test of the underlying market dynamics, is unfortunately insensitive to 
whether we keep or ignore the term D(x,t) in the drift: we’ve priced options 
in agreement with traders prices by treating R as constant while ignoring fat 
tails,  using  only  the  exponential  density  of  returns  [7,9].  Why  fat  tails  are 
ignored is explained below. 
 
 
2.3 Generalized Black-Scholes describes a Martingale 

The call price is calculated from the Green function v=g+(x,t;xT,T) of the pde 
(20),  where  the  dagger  denotes  the  adjoint.  The  forward  time  Kolmogorov 
pde 

  ! 0="v(xo,to)"to+(r#D(xo,to)/2)"v(xo,to)"xo+D(xo,to)2"2v(xo,to)"xo2  ! C(p,K,T"t)=er(t"T)(pT"K)"##$%(pT"K)g(xT,T;x,t)dxT 

 

 

 

 

 

   
 

 

 

 

has exactly the same Green function g(xT,T;x,t)=g+(x,t;xT,T). The price sde 
corresponding to this Fokker-Planck pde (dropping subscripts capital T, for 
convenience) is 

 (24) 

 

 

(25) 

where  d(p,t)=D(x,t)  and  r  is  the  risk  neutral  rate  of  return.  Then  with        
g(x,t;xo,to)=G(y,t;yo,to) (since dx=dy) [21] we obtain 

with E(y,t)=D(x,t), which corresponds to the sde  

   

(28) 

.  

(29) 

 
From this we obtain the corresponding price sde (with y=lnS(t)/Sc) 
 
 

 

 

(30) 

 
with price diffusion coefficient e(S,t)=E(y,t)=D(x,t)=d(p,t). This shows that 
the  risk  neutral  discounted  price  S=pe-rt  with  Sc=pc  is  drift  free,  is  a  local 
Martingale.  The condition for a global Martingale is equivalent, in adition, 
to requiring that the variance is finite. 
 
That the Black-Scholes pde is equivalent to a Martingale in the risk neutral 
discounted  stock  price  was  proven  abstractly  for  the  case  of  the  Gaussian 
returns model [23]. Our proof is not restricted to the unphysical assumption 
that D(x,t) is independent of x.

When R=constant then the reference price locates the maximum of f and the 
minimum  of  D  [10,23].  The  same  definition  applies  for  R(x,t)≠constant. 
Consider the price of a call for the case where p > pc: 
 

 
Here,  p  is  the  known  stock  price  at  present  time  t<T.  We  know  the  Green 
function analytically only for the case where g(x,t;0,0)=f(x,t), where f is the 
empirically observed distribution. This is equivalent to evaluating C for the 
consensus price, or ‘value’ p=pc, 
 

.  (31) 

. 

(32) 

 
This is adequate for making our main point: the empirically observed density 
has fat tails in logarithmic returns [11,12], f(x,t)≈x-m for x>>1, so we get 
 

 

.        (33) 

 
The option price will diverge for all p, not just for p=pc. If one inserts a finite 
cutoff in (32) then the option price is very sensitive to the cutoff, so that one 
can then predict essentially any option price. The evidence that traders don’t 
take fat tails into account is that the exponential returns model prices options 
in agreement with traders’ prices [7,9].  
 
Many  papers  have  been  written  purporting  to  price  options  using  fat  tails. 
Most  make  a  simple  mistake:  they  use  fat  tails  in  price  [24]  or  price 
increments, not returns. But fat tails in price is an exponential distribution in 
x  and  this  describes  small  to  moderate  returns,  not  fat  tails  [7].  One  paper 
[17]  starts  correctly  with  fat  tails  in  returns,  but  then  obtains  a  spurious 
Gaussian  convergence  factor  by  treating  the  stochastic  variable  u=x/tH  in  a 
time integral as if it would be both deterministic and drift free [21].

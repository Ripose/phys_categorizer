ABSTRACT 

Scale-free  networks  are  characterized  by  a  degree  distribution  with  power-law 

behavior and have been shown to arise in many areas, ranging from the World Wide 

Web to transportation or social networks. Degree distributions of observed networks, 

however, often differ from the power-law type and data based investigations require 

modifications of the typical scale-free network.  

We  present  an  algorithm  that  generates  networks  in  which  the  skewness  of  the 

degree  distribution  is  tuneable  by  modifying  the  preferential  attachment  step  of  the 

Barabási-Albert  construction  algorithm.  Skewness  is  linearly  correlated  with  the 

maximal degree of the network and, therefore, adequately represents the influence of 

superspreaders or hubs. By combining our algorithm with work of Holme and Kim, we 

show how to generate networks with skewness γ and clustering coefficient κ, over a 

wide range of values.

INTRODUCTION 

Since  the  development  of  effective  computational  tools,  intense  research  has 

broadened  our  understanding  of  the  structure  of  networks.  A  fascinating  mix  of 

theoretical  and  observational  work  has  pointed  out  differences  and  commonalities 

among  networks  ranging  from  the  World  Wide  Web  to  transportation  networks  to 

social networks associated with sexually transmitted diseases [1-7]. 

Theoretical work on networks has shown that the underlying contact structure has a 

crucial role to play in the transmission of a disease across a network [8-13]. Scale-

free  contact  networks,  in  which  the  probability  that  a  vertex  has  degree  k   is 

proportional  to 

α−k

,  have  been  shown  to  provide  particularly  fertile  grounds  for 

disease transmission. Investigations into the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 have also 

served to increase our appreciation of the importance of superspreaders, individuals 

who  are  connected  to  an  unusually  large  number  of  other  individuals,  in  disease 

spread [14].

Watts and Strogatz introduced the clustering coefficient in their seminal 1998 paper 

[1]. For a vertex  v  with  n  neighbors, the clustering coefficient of  v  is defined to be 

v =κ

,  where 

vE   is  the  number  of  edges  between  the  n   neighbors  of  vertex  v  

  is  the  maximum  number  of  edges  possible  among  those  n  

neighbors.  Then  κ,  the  mean  clustering  coefficient,  is  the  average  of 

vκ   across  all 

vertices  v  in the network. 

The Barabási-Albert preferential attachment algorithm generates scale-free networks, 

networks  in  which  the  probability  that  a  randomly  chosen  vertex  has  degree  k  is 

proportional  to 

α−k

,  with  α between  2  and  3  [15-17].  These  networks  include  a 

heavy tail of high-degree vertices. As modified by Holme and Kim, among others [18-

20], the Barabási-Albert algorithm can be used to create scale-free networks with a 

range  of  mean  clustering  coefficients.  In  this  paper  we  outline  an  algorithm  that 

generates networks in which the degree distribution is tuneable as well.

METHODS 

A  contact  network  of  10,000  individuals  was  created  using  a  generalization  of  the 

Holme  and  Kim  [20]  tuneable  clustering  version  of  the  Barabási-Albert  scale-free 

network  generation  algorithm.  An  initial  collection  of  8  vertices  was  connected  in  a 

cycle.  After  this,  the  remaining  9992  vertices  were  connected  one  at  a  time  to  the 

existing  network.  Vertex  v   was  attached  by  first  choosing  a  vertex  w   from  the 

existing network using the preferential attachment scheme described below. Vertices 

v and  w  were connected (bidirectionally), and then  v  was connected to three other 

vertices chosen independently by either a triad formation step (with probability  c ) or 

by  the  preferential  attachment  scheme  (with  probability 

c−1

).  Construction  was 

completed by revisiting the initial eight vertices and connecting each of them to three 

other vertices either by triad formation or preferential attachment. 

The preferential attachment algorithm used was a generalization of that described by 

Barabási and Albert [15]. In the classic BA algorithm, the probability that a vertex  w  

of degree  k  is chosen to be attached to vertex  v  is proportional to  k . We altered this 

algorithm  in  the  following  way:  The  n   vertices 

iw   in  the  existing  network  were 

ordered by their degree from largest to smallest, and then a random number  r  was 

chosen  from  a  tuning  distribution  with  range  [0,1]  and  expected  value 

Tµ ,  as 

described below. Vertex  v  was then attached to vertex 

jw  if

1>α  and

skewed (

1>α  and 

1<β ), or left-skewed (

1<α  and 

1>β ). 

The triad formation steps were used to induce clustering in the network. When vertex 

v  underwent a triad formation step, a vertex  w  was chosen uniformly at random from 

among  the  set  of  vertices  adjacent  to  v .  Then  a  vertex  u   was  chosen  from  the 

neighbors of  w  and vertex  v  and vertex  u  were connected (assuming that they were 

not already connected). 

The algorithm was executed 100 times for each

,  yielding  2500  total  networks  for  the  analysis.  In  order  to  test 

the  sensitivity  of  our  results  to  the  initial  configuration  of  vertices,  a  further  2500 

networks  were  generated  beginning  with  a  complete  graph  on  nine  vertices  (which 

maintains an average degree of 8 in the network).

III. 

RESULTS 

We report results from the networks in which the initial eight nodes were connected 

in  a  ring.    The  results  for  networks  that  were  seeded  with  a  complete  graph  were 

similar.   

Independent  of  the  parameter  settings,  the  10,000  vertices  in  the  network  had  an 

average of 8 contacts. As the tuning distribution used in the preferential attachment 

steps of the network creation algorithm influenced the amount of preference gained 

by  high-degree  vertices,  altering  this  distribution  allowed  us  to  influence  the  degree 

distribution of the resulting network, as illustrated in Fig. 1. In the following analysis (i) 

the  subscript  T   refers  to  a  tuning  distribution  while  a  subscript  D   refers  to  the 

degree  distribution  of  a  network,  (ii)  we  report  the  skewness  of  a  distribution  as 

3γ  

and call its cube root γ the root skewness of the distribution and (iii) we refer to the 

degree  distribution  generated  by  the  classic  scale-free  algorithm  of  Barabási  and 

Albert (

2/1=Tµ

, 

0=c

) as the scale-free (SF) degree distribution. Realizations of 100 

SF  degree  distributions  show  a  normally  distributed  root  skewness  with  mean 

26.2=Dγ

.  Varying  the  clustering  probability  does  not  substantially  change  the 

skewness (Fig. 2), e.g. even for the maximum value of the clustering parameter (c=1) 

the mean root skewness increases only to 

29.2=Dγ

.    

A.  Overskewness & underskewness 

We  call  a  degree  distribution  overskewed  if  the  skewness  exceeds  that  of  the  SF 

degree  distribution,  and  underskewed  if  the  skewness  falls  short  of  this  standard 

skewness.  Overskewed  degree  distributions  were  produced  by  applying  tuning 

distributions with expectation 

2/1<Tµ

, which make connections to vertices with high 

degree  more  likely  (Fig.  1,  row  1  and  Fig.  2).  Similarly,  underskewed  degree 

distributions  were  produced  by  applying  tuning  distributions  with  expectation 

2/1>Tµ

,  which  make  connections  to  vertices  with  few  contacts  more  likely  (Fig.  1, 

row  3  and  Fig.  2).  Hence,  the  root  skewness  of  the  degree  distribution  is  inversely 

related  to  the  expectation  of  the  tuning  distribution.  The  slope  of  this  linear 

relationship  strongly  depends  on  the  clustering  (e.g.  for 

0=c

). Overskewness is in most cases associated with vertices of 

5 

very high degree, and those vertices can play the role of superspreaders in models of 

the spread of disease or computer viruses across a network.  

The cube root skewness of the degree distribution γ is highly correlated with  3

maxD  

as well as with 

log( maxD

)

, where 

maxD  is the degree of the vertex with highest degree 

in the network. For the networks under consideration here, the linear relationship is 

stronger  using

  indicates  that 

log( maxD

)

  and  root  skewness  can  be  used  interchangeably  to  characterize  the 

variability in the degree distribution of networks generated by our algorithm. 

B.  Clustering 

Holme  and  Kim  [20]  reported  a  strong  linear  correlation  between  clustering 

probability  c   and  mean  clustering  coefficient  κ,  but  the  relationship  shows  a  slight 

curvature  which  can  be  fitted  more  adequately  by  exponential  curves  of  the  form

 and

 (Fig. 3).  

The  relationship  between  clustering  and  degree  skewness 

is  slightly  more 

complicated  and  can  best  be  understood  by  referring  to  the  SF  degree  distribution. 

For underskewed degree distributions, increasing the clustering parameter increased 

the  skewness  of  the  degree  distribution.  For  overskewed  degree  distributions  the 

clustering  parameter  lowered  the  skewness  of  the  degree  distribution.  Thus  in  all 

cases  increasing  the  clustering  parameter  tended  to  make  the  resulting  degree 

distribution more like the SF degree distribution, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 2. 

With  this  said,  it  is  notable  that  the  algorithm  produced  a  variety  of  degree 

distributions with the same mean clustering, as shown in Fig. 4. To produce degree 

distributions with the same skewness and different mean clustering required the use 

of different tuning distributions.

IV. 

DISCUSSION 

We  have  exhibited  an  algorithm  that  produces  contact  networks  with  varying 

skewness and clustering. Investigations into real networks may demand other tuning 

distributions by which the degree distribution can be modified.  

Using  beta  distributions,  which  can  be  uniform,  left-  or  right-skewed,  or  even  U-

shaped,  can  provide  more  flexible  tuning  and  produce  a  wide  variety  of  degree 

distributions.    Two  examples,  using  symmetric  beta  distributions  with  expectation 

2/1=Tµ

,  are  illustrated  in  Fig.  5.  Such  variations  of  the  beta  distribution  can  even 

lead  to  non-monotonic  degree  distributions.  With  a  U-shaped  beta  distribution,  for 

example,  contacts  are  preferentially  attached  to  vertices  with  lowest  and  highest 

degrees, increasing the prevalence of low-degree as well as the prevalence of high-

degree vertices (superspreaders, hubs). Bell-shaped beta distributions, on the other 

hand, promote vertices with intermediate degree while preventing the occurrence of 

hubs.  These  examples  show  that  beta  tuning  distributions  should  be  capable  of 

producing most degree distributions observed in real networks. 

We have also shown that in a wide range of degree distributions, the skewness of the 

distribution  is  strongly  correlated  with  the  maximum  degree  of  the  network.  Thus 

much  of  the  information  contained  in  the  global  measure  (skewness)  is  already 

contained  in  a  local  measure  (degree),  although  finding  the  value  of  the  largest 

degree in an actual network may be very difficult. 

As epidemiologists and other researchers continue to apply network techniques to a 

variety  of  areas,  increased  flexibility  in  network  algorithms  will  be  necessary.  The 

results reported here provide a measure of that flexibility with little overhead.

outliers  are  defined  to  lie  outside  this  range.  The  skewness  distributions  are  largely 

symmetric, so means and corresponding medians are close to each other. SF degree

the  upper  part  of  the  graph  indicate  the  effect  of  clustering  on  the  skewness  of  the 

degree  distribution.  Clustering  shifts  the  skewness  towards  the  standard,  i.e.  it 

increases the skewness of underskewed degree distributions (ascending arrows) and 

it decreases the skewness of overskewed degree distributions (descending arrows).

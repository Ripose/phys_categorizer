Abstract: We develop a new method for the statistical estimation of the tail of the distribution of 
earthquake sizes recorded in the Harvard catalog of seismic moments converted to mW-
magnitudes (1977-2004 and 1977-2006). For this, we suggest a new parametric model for the 
distribution of main shock magnitudes, which is composed of two branches, the pure Gutenberg-
Richter distribution up to an upper magnitude threshold m1, followed by another branch with a 
maximum upper magnitude bound Mmax, which we refer to as the two-branch model. We find 
that the number of main events in the catalog (N = 3975 for 1977-2004 and N=4193 for 1977-
2006) is insufficient for a direct estimation of the parameters of this model, due to the inherent 
instability of the estimation problem. This problem is likely to be the same for any other two-
branch model. This inherent limitation can be explained by the fact that only a small fraction of 
the empirical data populates the second branch. We then show that using the set of maximum 
magnitudes (the set of T-maxima) in windows of duration T days provides a significant 
improvement, in particular (i) by minimizing the negative impact of time-clustering of foreshock 
/ main shock / aftershock sequences in the estimation of the tail of magnitude distribution, and 
(ii) by providing via a simulation method reliable estimates of the biases in the Moment 
estimation procedure (which turns out to be more efficient than the Maximum Likelihood 
estimation). We propose a method for the determination of the optimal choice of the T-value 
minimizing the Mean Square Error of the estimation of the form parameter of the GEV 
distribution approximating the sample distribution of T-maxima, which yields Toptimal=500 days. 
We have estimated the following quantiles of the distribution of T-maxima for the whole period 
1977-2006: Q16%(Mmax)= 9.3, Q50%(Mmax)= 9.7  and  Q84%(Mmax) = 10.3. Finally, we suggest two 
more stable statistical characteristics of the tail of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes: the 
quantile QT(q) of a high probability level q for the T-maxima, and the probability of exceedence 
of a high threshold magnitude   ρ T(m*) = P{ mk ≥ m*}. We obtained the following sample 
estimates for the global Harvard catalog 
comparison between our estimates for the two periods 1977-2004 and 1977-2006, where the later 
period included the great Sumatra earthquake 24.12.2004, mW=9.0 confirms the instability of the 
estimation of the parameter Mmax and the stability of QT(q) and ρ T(m*) = P{ mk ≥ m*}.

1.  Introduction 
 

    In a series of papers, Gutenberg and Richter (1942, 1954, 1956) suggested their famous 
formula 
                   
                                        log NT(m) = aT – b m,                                                         
 
with parameters aT and b. The formula (1) gives the number of earthquakes  NT(m) with 
magnitudes M ≥ m, occurring in a large seismic zone or at the global scale for a sufficiently long 
time period T. Relation (1), referred to as the magnitude-frequency law, has become one of the 
fundamental laws of seismology. With the assumption that seismicity is stationary, the 
Gutenberg-Richter law describes the frequency λ(m) for the occurrences of earthquakes with 
magnitudes exceeding m,  
 

(1) 

log λ(m) = α - β m, or equivalently λ(m) = 10α−βm,   

 
where     
    

λ(m) =

NT(m) / T.  

 

 

 

 

 
The parameter α characterizes the seismicity level in the particular zone of study, while the 
parameter β  (defined as the slope of the magnitude frequency law) quantifies the relative 
frequency of large versus small earthquakes.  

More generally, if one fixes a lower threshold m0 of registered magnitudes then, after

(m) = 

.                                                          

(m), defined as the complementary of 

(m),        m ≥ m0,                                       

(m)  is some non-increasing function, varying from 1 down to 0. In the case for which 

normalization of eq. (2) by λ(m0), the frequency λ(m) can be written  
 
                              λ(m) / λ(m0)  = 
 
where 
the Gutenberg-Richter law holds, we have: 
 
                              
 
      This implies that the function F(m) = 1 - 
respect to unity, can be considered as a distribution function of earthquake sizes. Note that 
expression (4) does not contain any information on the seismicity level, which would be 
necessary for assessing seismic risks. It is only intended to describe the characteristics of the 
distribution of earthquake sizes. The exponential law (5) for the complementary distribution of 
magnitudes (5) corresponds to a power law distribution of seismic moments. 
If we apply, as it is often done, formulae (1)-(5) to the main shocks of some catalog, and 
  
if we assume that the temporal flow of events is Poissonian then, for a fixed number of events n, 
the realized magnitudes m1,…, mn can be considered as a sample of iid rv (independent 
identically distributed random variables) with distribution function F(m). In the case of a 
Poissonian flow of main shocks, the relation between the temporal flow of earthquakes and a 
sample of n identically distributed independent random values is established. If the time span 
covered by the catalog grows, the random (Poissonian) number n tends with probability one to 
infinity, and asymptotic statistical inference obtained for the sample of the n iid rv become valid 
for Poissonian flow of events. Though, statistical inferences based on the condition of a fixed 
finite n is of interest by itself too. 
          The Gutenberg-Richter (G-R) law has been subjected to numerous investigations (see, e.g. 
Bird and Kagan, 2004; Cosentino et al., 1977; Kagan, 1991; 1996; 1999; 2002a; 2002b; Kijko

Pisarenko and Sornette, 2003; 2004; Sornette et al., 1996; Utsu, 1999; Wu, 2000). One can 
summarize the present situation by saying that, for small and moderate magnitudes, and for large 
space-time volumes, the Gutenberg-Richter law is valid with a large degree of accuracy. 
However, for the largest magnitudes, some more or less significant deviations from (1) have 
been documented (see e.g. Pisarenko and Sornette (2004) and references therein). Their 
investigation is hampered by the insufficient number of large earthquakes. Inevitably, existing 
models of the deviations from the G-R and the numerous proposals to modify it for large 
magnitudes suffer from large statistical uncertainty. As a consequence, the problem of finding an 
adequate description of the tail of the magnitude distribution cannot be considered as definitely 
settled. One of the best known modifications of the G-R (Kagan, 1997; Kagan and Schoenberg, 
2001) consists in multiplying the power law distribution of seismic moments (which, as we 
recalled above, corresponds to the G-R exponential distribution of magnitudes) by an 
exponential factor (also referred to as an exponential taper) which leads to a Gamma-distribution 
for seismic moments. The characteristic moment in the exponential taper is often referred to as 
the “corner” moment, as it constitutes the typical magnitude at which the distribution departs 
significantly downward from the pure G-R law. The corner moment is not the absolute 
maximum size and larger earthquake moment are authorized in this model, albeit with 
exponentially smaller probability. This exponential taper to the power law of seismic moments 
constitutes one among several attempts to take into account the presence of a downward 
curvature observed in the empirical distribution of earthquake sizes for the largest moments (or 
magnitudes). See Bird and Kagan (2004) for the use of the “Kagan” model to determine the 
“corner” magnitude for seven different tectonic settings.  
 
assume that the G-R law holds up to a maximum magnitude M, beyond which no earthquake are 
observed (Cosentino et al., 1977; Dargahi-Noubary, 1983; Main et al., 1999; Pisarenko, 1991; 
Pisarenko et al., 1996)  
                                    0;                                                                                    x < m ; 
          F(x) = 
                                    1;                                                                                    x > M .  
 
The parameter M represents the maximum possible earthquake size: M = Mmax. This parameter 
plays a very important role in seismic risk assessment and in seismic hazard mitigation (see e.g. 
Bender and Perkins, 1993; Pisarenko et al., 1996; Kijko and Graham, 1998; Kijko et al., 2001). It 
should be noted that the truncated G-R (6) ensures the finiteness of the mean seismic energy, 
whereas the G-R in its unlimited form (1)-(5) corresponds to a regime with infinite seismic 
energy, which is, of course, an undesirable property of the model (the exponential taper in the 
Kagan model of seismic moment distribution ensures also the finiteness of the mean seismic 
moment (Knopoff and Kagan, 1977)). The parameter Mmax  is very suitable for engineers and 
insurers: having a reliable estimate of Mmax,  it is comparatively easy to take adequate decisions 
on the construction standards of buildings or about insurance policy. As a consequence,  the 
modified G-R (6) has undergone a wide dissemination. Unfortunately, all attempts so far for a 
reliable statistical estimation of Mmax did not give satisfactory results. The statistical scatter of its 
estimates and their reliability are far from the desirable level. Attempts to attribute a maximum 
magnitude to individual faults rather than to regions suffer from the same problems and in 
addition face the fact that many large earthquakes involve several faults or fault segments which 
are difficult if not impossible to determine in advance (Black et al., 2004; Ward, 1997).  

Rather than introducing a “soft” truncation of the G-R law, a different class of models 

 

Below, we explain and illustrate the intrinsically unstable properties of the determination of 

Mmax. Besides, Mmax. has the following undesirable features. 
 

1.  Mmax is ill-defined. It does not contain the time interval (or, time scale) over which it is 

valid. Suppose we are supplied with a very good estimate of Mmax. Is this value related to 

 

3 

 [ 10-βm  - 10-βx ] / [ 10-βm  - 10-βM ];                            m ≤ x ≤ M ;      (6)                           

the whole geologic history (4.5*109 years), or to the last geological time period since the 
Gondwana accretion (200*106 years), or to the last 200 years? This question, we believe, 
should be very important for practical applications, but Mmax does not answer it at all. A 
way to circumvent this problem is to define Mmax as the magnitude of an exceedingly low 
probability event over a finite time period, say the next 30 years. This last definition is 
more in line with the needs of insurance and risk policy. 

2.  It is a fact that the maximum earthquake magnitude should be finite because the Earth is 
finite. But using the “small increment” argument (where ε is an arbitrary small positive 
number), one can always argue that “if the magnitude, say M*, is the maximum possible, 
then why is magnitude (M* + ε) impossible? It is difficult to answer this question 
properly.  

The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the general background on the 

       3. Finally, the parameter Mmax is highly unstable from a statistical point of view. We are 
going to demonstrate this fact below. 
       Thus, in spite of its practical attractiveness and its implication for constraining physical 
models and for risk assessment, we believe that Mmax  cannot be used fruitfully in applications.

theory of extreme value statistics and applies it to the set of T-maxima, the maximum 
magnitudes in time windows of duration equal to T days. Section 2.1 and Appendix A describe 
the declustering algorithm used here to prepare a set of N main shocks which are further 
analyzed in the remaining of the paper. Section 2.2 and Appendix B presents the main results on 
the estimation of the parameters of the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution fitted to 
the empirical distribution of T-maxima of the global Harvard catalogues of shallow earthquakes. 
Section 2.3 stresses the inherent instability of the determination of Mmax and suggests two more 
stable characteristics of the tail behavior.  Section 2.4 presents a reshuffling procedure that 
improves the estimates and provide in addition confidence intervals. Section 3 and Appendix C 
presents the two-branch model which is at the basis of our simulation procedure. The later allows 
us to quantify rather precisely the strong biases in the estimation of the parameters of the GEV 
distribution. Section 3.1 presents the method to determine the optimal time window T, 
subsequently used in the determination of Mmax and of the other tail characteristics. Section 3.2 
derives our main results and presents the skewed distributions of the different tail characteristics. 
Section 4 summarizes all our results and gather together all the main numerical estimations of 
the tail characteristics.  
 
2. Estimation of Mmax in T-windows using the Generalized Extreme Value Theory applied 
to the declustered catalogs 
 

2.1 Preparation of the data 

 
Our different analyses presented below are performed on a declustered catalog, in which 
aftershocks have been removed more or less exhaustively according to a standard method 
described and tested in Appendix A. As shown in Appendix A, the stationarity of the declustered 
catalog of main shocks can be considered satisfactory for the time period 01.01.77-20.12.04 over 
the magnitude range mW ≥ 5.5. Two standard statistical tests do not reject the hypothesis that 
these main shocks obey a Poisson process with a constant rate. 

Let us consider such a declustered catalog. It is a sample x1,… xN  of N iid rv 
(independently identically distributed random variables) representing the magnitude 
measurements of main shocks in a catalog that occurred at the corresponding times  t1,… tN.  
Following Epstein and Lomnitz (1966), let us then divide the time interval (t1, tN )  covered by 
the catalog into n segments of length T (days) (n ≅ (tN- t1)/T ). Within each time segment, we 

 

4 

measure the maximum magnitude that we denote as mk . In this way, we get a sample of n 
maxima m1 ,…, mn . While this reduces the set of events from N to n, it turns out that the 
distribution of these T-maxima is more appropriate for estimating the tail of the distribution of 
earthquake magnitudes. Indeed, the construction of the sample of T-maxima from the catalog of 
main shocks amounts in some sense to applying a “large magnitude” filter which emphasizes 
large magnitudes and removes lower magnitudes. There are several advantages in applying this 
filter. 
 
First, we minimize the influence of the a priori unknown random temporal process 
governing the time occurrence  t1,… tN of the N events, which allows us to focus exclusively on 
the distribution of magnitudes. Fixing a time interval T and measuring the maximum magnitude 
mmax(T) within this interval avoids the problem associated with the random number of events. As 
a result of such operation, we obtain the sequence of iid rv  mmax(T1),  mmax(T2),  … , whereas, the 
initial declustered catalog is a sample of a marked point process m1, m2,… that occurred at 
random times t1, t2,… This has a significant impact, for instance in writing the likelihood 
function. Furthermore, this construction of n T-maxima significantly weakens the disturbances 
coming from remaining “aftershocks” and other triggered events, that may not have been fully 
removed by the declustering method described in Appendix A. Indeed, aftershocks have more 
often lower magnitudes and thus enter in the sequence of mmax(T1),  mmax(T2), … with small 
probability.  
 
While the later is ill-defined as we mentioned above, the maximum magnitude mk of events that 
occurred in the time interval (0; T) is well-defined and perhaps more fruitful for practical users. 
Note that if the DF of single event magnitudes is F(x), and if the sequence of events is a 
Poissonian sequence with intensity λ, then the DF for the maximum magnitude  mk in a T-
window is denoted as ΦT(x) and is given by 

The study of the rv  mmax(T1),  mmax(T2),  … , mmax(Tn) is more convenient that of Mmax. 

              ΦT(x) = P{ mk < x;  n ≥ 1 }=

(x) exp( -λT) (λT)k/k! / [1 – exp( -λT)] = 

                       ={ exp[ -λT(1 – F(x)) ] -  exp( -λT) } / [1 – exp( -λT)].                               (7) 
 
When one can assume that the initial sample can be safely modeled by iid rv with some 
 
magnitude distribution, then using the full data set rather than the reduced set of n T-Maxima is 
superior since, in principle, the whole initial sample is generally more informative than any 
reduced sample (Knopoff and Kagan, 1977). But this requires a rather strong faith in the ability 
of the declustering algorithm so that the main shock time occurrences are truly Poissonian. 
Otherwise, the distribution of time occurrences inevitably enters into the likelihood of the 
sample. While the two tests in Appendix A cannot reject this hypothesis for the declustered 
catalog, there are still remaining dependencies between the main shocks. These dependencies are 
strongly reduced by working with the set of n T-maxima. Using the n T-maxima m1,…,mn 
significantly weakens the influence of aftershocks and the possibly complex time dependence 
between events, and makes possible the application of general results of the theory of extreme 
values (of course under the assumption that the initial distribution of magnitudes satisfies the 
conditions of the  theorems of this theory).    
 

2.2 Estimation of the three parameters (m, s, ξ) of the GEV distribution of T-maxima mk 

We thus assume that the initial distribution of magnitudes satisfies the conditions of 

 
 
extreme value theory. Consequently, the distribution of the T-maxima mk can be satisfactorily 
approximated by the limit distribution of extreme value theory, named the Generalized Extreme 
Value (GEV) distribution. The GEV distribution function (DF) depends on 3 parameters (m, s, ξ) 
and is given as:

  (10) 

Our central point consists in assuming that the maximum magnitude is bounded. Thus, in 

                 F(x) = exp{ -[1+(ξ/s)*(x-m)]-1/ξ };   1+(ξ/s)*(x-m)]  > 0;    ξ ≠ 0;                            (8) 
 
                 F(x) = exp{ -exp[-(x-m)/s] };       ξ = 0,                                                                     (9) 
 
where m is the location parameter; s is the scale parameter, and  ξ is the form parameter. In 
accordance with eq.(8), the domain of non-zero probability depends on the parameters, which 
makes the GEV family non-regular. In other words, this family does not satisfy the conditions of 
regularity required by the standard theory of maximum likelihood estimation.  
 
accordance with eq.(8), only negative values of the form parameter  ξ  are acceptable, which 
give the following upper limit Mmax for magnitudes: 
 
                                          mk ≤ Mmax = m – s/ξ ;    ξ  < 0.    
 
Because the number n of T-maxima is not large, it is important to ask if the Maximum 
Likelihood Estimates (MLE) is the most efficient. Appendix B compares three well-known 
methods for the statistical estimation of GEV-parameters (m, s, ξ): the Maximum Likelihood 
Estimates (MLE), the Moment Estimates (ME) and estimates based on Probability-Weighted 
Moments. For small and moderate sample sizes (n ≅ 10 ÷ 50), the MLE are less efficient than the 
ME and the PWM estimate, whereas in turn the ME is slightly better than the PWM estimate. 
These differences disappear for larger sample size (n = 200). Thus, we shall use the Moment 
Estimates as the most efficient for estimation of GEV-parameters in our situation. We choose the 
window size T as a compromise between two conflicting requirements.  While a smaller T 
increases the sample size n, T  can not be too small, since the limit theory of extreme values 
requires a large number of observations in each T-interval. With too small T’s, we can even get 
empty T-intervals with no event. In contrast, T cannot be very large, since n would be small, and 
the estimation of parameters would be inefficient, as shown in Appendix B. How can we judge 
on these conflicting conditions? The first condition demands that we should not have (or, almost 
not have) empty intervals. In our case, this condition demands T ≅ 15 days, or larger. For T=10, 
the percentage of non-empty T-intervals is 98.04%; for T=15 percent, it is 99.71, and only from 
T=16 and larger, we have 100% of non-empty T-intervals. On the other hand, the scatter of ME-
estimates makes us take T not more than, say, 300 since our time span (10214 days) is such that 
for T = 300 we have only n ≅ 30 which we take as the lower limit for a reliable estimation of the 
three parameters (m, s, ξ). 
 
We thus estimate the three parameters (m, s, ξ) for the sample m1 ,…, mn by the method 
of Moments described in Appendix B. We also performed all the estimations presented below 
with the Maximum Likelihood method and confirm the known fact that the method of Moments 
is more efficient for small sample size n of the order of 50 or less (see Hosking et al. 1985, Coles 
and Dixon 1999).  Therefore, we only report our results obtained with the method of moments. 
We present our results for the Harvard catalog of seismic moments in the time interval 
01.01.1977-18.12.2004. This interval was chosen because it does not contain the largest event on 
24 December 2004 and some of its foreshocks. Very similar results are obtained for the subset of 
shallow earthquakes confined to subduction zones, confirming the stability of our estimates. 
Fig.1 shows the Moment Estimation (ME) of the parameter ξ  for the global Harvard 

catalog of shallow events (01.01.77-18.12.04; h ≤ 70 km; Mw ≥  5.5; N = 3975 main shocks) as a 
function of the time duration T. It is clear from the figure that the accuracy of the ξ-estimate 
depends on T. Similar dependences occur for the other parameters, although their dependence is 
not as dramatic. We show these dependences in Table 1 for a set of T-values.

has to use a numerically simulated distribution of KD-distances in the simulation procedure 
using random GEV samples with the same fitted parameters (
). We will show below 
figures illustrating the range of T-values over which the KD-distances can be considered to be 
minimized and stable. 
 

2.3 Instability of Mmax and better characteristic of the tail behavior

It is clear from Table 1 that 
be explained as follows. Consider a sample of limited size n (say n ≅ 30 of one-year-intervals or 
120 intervals of length 3 months, as in the Harvard catalog covering the time period 1977-2006), 
and suppose further that true value of the parameter  ξ0  is small in absolute value (-0.1 or 
smaller which corresponds to the real situation as becomes clear below). Then, it is quite 
possible that even for the most efficient estimators 
standard deviation (std) comparable with the true value ξ0 . In other words, it is quite possible 
that, due to the random scatter, the estimator  
unlimited power-like distributions, a result clearly impossible according to our assumption on the 
bounded nature of the distribution of magnitudes. In such a situation, if we would try to derive 
the estimator for  Mmax as given by eq.(10), we  would get a very unstable estimator, since the 
parameter ξ is in denominator of expression (10). Thus, the parameter Mmax is intrinsically 
unstable in the statistical estimation (under the condition that the studied catalog has not many 
large earthquakes, which unfortunately is always the case). 
 
way: 
 

We suggest two characteristics that quantify the tail behavior in a better and more stable 

 can take positive values, corresponding to 

, the random deviations (

 - ξ0) has a 

1.  The quantile QT(q) of the level q of the distribution ΦT(x), i.e. the root of equation 
  
                                                 ΦT(x) =  q;                                                                         (12) 

 
       2.   The probability for mmax(T) of exceeding some fixed magnitude threshold: 
 
                                                     ρ T(m*) = P{ mk ≥ m*},                                                          (13)              
 

      where m* is a fixed (known) rather high threshold.  

 
Of course, these two characteristics are related with each other, and we consider both only 
because it could be more convenient to use one of them in a particular application. We are going 
to show that these characteristics are more stable than Mmax . The stability of QT(q) when the 
parameter ξ varies in the neighborhood of zero can be deduced from the fact that QT(q) unlike 
Mmax tends to a finite value as ξ  tends to zero, whereas Mmax tends to infinity in accordance with 
eq.(10). 

Fig.2a shows the quantiles QT(q=0.98)  of the GEV distribution of the maximum 

 

magnitudes mk in time intervals of duration T,  with parameters equal to the ME-estimates 
obtained from the global Harvard catalog: 
 
  
 
For T >70 days, the quantiles QT(q=0.98)  stabilize with only a very slow increase as a function 
of T. Even for smaller T’s, down to 20 days, QT(q=0.98) is remarkably stable.

Fig. 2b shows the ME-estimates of the probability P(T) that the maximum magnitude in a time 
window T exceeds 8.0 (mk ≥ 8.0). Here again, one can observe the more stable behavior of P(T) 
compared with that of Mmax. However, unfortunately, in the range T = 50-200, a steady positive 
increase of P(T) occurs that slows down only above T ≅ 200.  In addition to the more stable 
behavior of QT(q=0.98) and P(T) with respect to variations of T, we will see below that these 
characteristics are as well more stable with respect to random fluctuations.  
 
 

2.4  Reshuffling procedure and improved ensemble estimates 
 

Fig.1 shows that there is a strong random scatter of the ξ-estimates for T ≅ 170 and larger. The 
scatter looks like a white noise on a background with a smooth trend, thus associated with two 
correlation components: delta-like and low frequency. It is possible to suppress to some extent 
the delta component, i.e., the white noise contribution, while the smooth trend cannot be 
removed without more information (see below). In order to remove the delta-like noise, we use 
the following method. The initial sample of size N  is cut into n segments of length T. If N is 
fixed, then the distribution of occurrence times is uniform in the whole time interval (t1, tN ) 
covered by the catalog. But in accordance with our approach, all statistical characteristics would 
not change if we shuffle the occurrence times randomly over the whole time interval (t1, tN ). 
After reshuffling, the sample of T-maxima with size n is changed. Therefore, repeating the 
reshuffling procedure M times, we get M different samples of T-maxima, over which we can 
average. Of course, these different samples are statistically dependent, but nevertheless, additive 
averaging can reduce the scatter to some extent. What is very important is that we can apply this 
procedure to the unique real sample that we have.

the Q-estimates steadily increase from QT(q=0.98) = 8.33 up to QT(q=0.98) =8.39. It is clear 
from Fig.4 that that T-values less than 50 are inadmissible in the estimation procedure.

shocks); h ≤ 70 km; Mw ≥  5.5; N =1287 main shocks). Since estimates of Mmax are unstable, we 
use the order statistics, namely, median, 5%  and 95% sample quantiles. The use of the sample 
mean and of the std would lead to very scattered and unstable estimates. In contrast, the interval 
between the 5% and 95% sample quantiles can be used as a rather reliable estimate of the 90% 
confidence interval. We see that the sample median of the 50 shuffled realizations behaves rather 
smoothly. It monotonically decreases, approaching the maximum observed magnitude in the 
whole sample (mW = 8.4) as the time window size T increases. This monotonic decrease and the 
convergence to the maximum observed magnitude is a bad sign of a significant bias of the 
method.

3. Moment Estimation of the GEV-parameters for the Harvard catalog with a simulation 
procedure minimizing scatter and systematic biases 
 
3.1 Determination of the optimal choice of the size T of the windows for the T-maxima 
 
Table 1 has made clear that the Moment-estimates of the GEV distribution fitted to the empirical 
DF of the T-maxima depend crucially on the value of T. How is possible to choose T in an 
optimal way? We have investigated this problem by simulations using artificial catalogs 
generated with a realistic two-branch model described in Appendix C. We have applied to these 
synthetic catalogs the Moment method with reshuffling as explained in section 2.4. We have 
considered the four sets of the pair of parameters (m1, Mmax) for the two-branch model 
parameterized according to equations (C1-C3): 
 

m1, = 7.5;  Mmax = 9.5;       
m1, = 7.5;  Mmax = 10.5;                                                                                               (15) 
m1, = 8.0;  Mmax = 9.5;       
m1, = 8.0;  Mmax = 10.5.

We consider that these values cover possible intermediate values of interest, and we try to 
determine an optimal value of T that would be satisfactory simultaneously for these four sets.

The parameter b was fixed at the value b=2.1 (using natural logarithms), which corresponds to 
b/ln(10) = 0.912 in the Gutenberg-Richter law. This value corresponds to the best Maximum 
Likelihood estimate of the slope parameter of the truncated Gutenberg-Richter law for global 
Harvard sample, N=3975, in the magnitude range  (mW = 5.5 to mW = 7.8).  
 
examples in (15), we know that the use of the T-maxima must keep the parameters ξ  and Mmax   
to the values associated with the limit GEV-distribution of corresponding T-maxima in the limit 
where the convergence to the extreme value distribution can be considered to hold. As we 
discuss in Appendix C, the direct fit of the two-branch model is less efficient that using the T-
maxima: the distribution of the T-maxima is more appropriate for the estimation of the tail of the 
distribution of magnitudes. The procedure consisting in starting from a two-branch distribution 
(C1-C3), generating a catalog of N main shock from it and then extracting from it a catalog of n 
T-maxima is illustrated in Fig.6. This figure shows  (in linear scale) a two-branch density (G-R), 
the resulting density of T-maxima calculated from equation (7), and the approximating GEV 
density.  
      When fitting the GEV distribution to the DF of the sample of  T-maxima, we have here the 
luxury of knowing the exact true values of the GEV-parameters ξ  and Mmax. We can use this 
knowledge to calculate of mean square error (MSE) of the Moment-estimate of the form 
parameter ξ  and parameter  Mmax . We take the MSE of these parameters for a fixed T as a 
characteristic of the efficiency of the Moment-estimation for this window size T: 

                       MSEξ(T |m1, Mmax ) =[ (1/ns) 

( <ξT>j - ξ )2 ]1/2 ;                                      (16a) 

                      MSEMmax(T |m1, Mmax ) =[ (1/ns) 

( <Mmax T>j – (m – s/ξ ) )2 ]1/2 .         (16b) 

 
In expressions (16), ns (=25 typically) is the number of simulations; <ξT>j is the average of the 
Moment estimates of ξ over NS (=50 typically) shuffles in the j-th simulation;  ξ  is the true value 
of the form parameter. The value of T corresponding to the minimum MSE can be considered as 
optimal. Plots of MSE(T) as a function of T for the four sets of models (15)  are shown on 
Fig.7a-h. One can observe that the domain over which the MSE(T) remain close to their minima 
varies from T=90 up to T=230. We can take as a trade-off the value T =182.5  (half year) 
ensuring that the MSE is close to its minimal value for all four models (15).  

In a first step, we are going to calculate the Moment-estimates of the parameters of the 
empirical data sets using this T-value. In a second step, we want to evaluate the corresponding 
standard deviation (std) using the information provided by the simulations with the two-branch 
model (C1-C3).

corrections for scatter and systematic biases by the simulation method. 

 
     Applying the Moment method with T=182.5 and with NS = 1000 reshufflings to the GEV 
distribution with three unknown parameters (m,σ,ξg ) ) for the distribution of T-maxima of the 
empirical global Harvard catalog (01.01.77-18.12.04; mW ≥ 5.5; h ≤ 70 km; main shocks, 
N=3975), we get the following estimates: 
 

                                        = 7.49; 

 = 0.381; 

 = -0.320.    

 

 

(17) 

 

The parameter Mmax was estimated through the sample median of the set of estimates obtained 
with the reshuffled catalogs: 

 
                                   med(

) = 8.70.                                                                          (18) 

 
We estimated the scatter of these estimates within the set of reshuffled catalogs (recall that this is 
only a fraction of the full scatter since, for a unique real sample, one cannot estimate directly the 
global scatter) by calculating the corresponding std, denoted as 

. We obtained

 ≅ 0.051.                               (19a)       

   
         For the parameter Mmax, we took as a scatter measure the pair of sample quantiles at the 
probability levels 16% and 84% corresponding in the Gaussian case to the mean value ±std: 
 
                                             qMmax(0.16) = 8.57;   qMmax(0.84) = 8.83.                                   (19b) 
 
For the sample 95% confidence interval, corresponding to quantiles 2.5% and 97.5%,  we get: 
 
                                    qMmax(0.025) = 8.45;   qMmax(0.975) = 9.02. 
 
We stress that (19a),(19b) characterize only a fraction of the full scatter. The histogram of Mmax 
for 1000 reshuffling is shown on Fig.8. One can see that just the contribution due to the 
reshuffling procedure already gives rise to a significant variation of the estimates of this 
parameter, which can take values going up to 9.25.

    We know from the simulation experiments described above and in the Appendix C that these 
estimates have a statistical scatter and some systematic bias depending both on T and on the 
unknown true values of these parameters. We are going to evaluate these characteristics by the 
simulation method. For this purpose, we simulate the full procedure of the estimation starting 
from an artificial catalog generated by the two-branch model (C1-C3) with parameters (m1, 
Mmax), the parameter b is fixed at the value b=2.1, all other parameters being determined through 
(m1,Mmax). As a representative set of parameter pairs, we consider again the four pairs (15). We 
fixed T = 182.5 days. The resulting statistical characteristics of the Moment estimates are 
collected in Table 2.

We observe that the std of all three parameters (m,s,ξ) can be taken approximately constant 
around the values  
 
                                   σm ≅ 0.05;         σs ≅ 0.03;           σξ ≅ 0.06.                                     (20) 
 
We infer that the std of the Moment estimates (17)  in the real sample are close to (20). As to the 
bias of the ξ-estimate, we see that it is negligible (as compared to its corresponding std) for the 
first two sets of (m1, Mmax), and comparable to the corresponding std for the third and fourth sets. 
Since we have no information about the possible true values of (m1, Mmax), we prefer to introduce 
no correction for the bias of the ξ-estimate, keeping in the mind the possibility for the existence 
of a bias which can be as large as 0.085.  
  
remarked above, this estimate is rather unstable as compared with the estimates of the other 
parameters. Therefore, it is more appropriate to estimate its scatter by the order sample statistics, 
namely, the sample quantiles, which are more robust statistically. We thus took the sample 
“spread” corresponding to one std in the Gaussian case: 
 
                            Upper Spread (US) = q(0.84) -  median . 
 
We averaged these spreads over the four sets of pairs (m1, Mmax) used in Table 2, and obtained 
the following average spread (the robust analog of the std) for the parameter Mmax: 
 
                                               US = 1.93 ≅ 2.0;                                                                    (21) 
 
Then, using the sample median (18) for the real Harvard sample and the spread (21), we can 
provide the following upper confidence bound 
analog of one-std upper bound for the Gaussian distribution): 
 
                                             
 

Let us now discuss the scatter of the moment-estimate of the parameter Mmax. As it was

) = 8.7;    

 = 0.38 ±  0.03;            

 = -0.32 ± 0.06 ;               (22)  

This value is considerably larger than the fractional upper bound qMmax(0.84) = 8.83 given by 
(19b).  
     Our final estimates of the GEV-parameters with their scatter characteristics for the global 
Harvard catalog are the following: 
 
          = 7.5 ±  0.05;         ; 
 
                           med(
 
 
 
 
 
Let us now turn to the determination of the estimators of the two better and more stable 
characteristics introduced in section 2.3, the  quantile QT(q) (defined in equation (12)) and the 
probability ρT(m*) (defined in equation (13))  for the GEV distribution fitted to the empirical 
distribution of the T-maxima. For the global Harvard catalogue (01.01.77-18.12.04; mW ≥ 5.5; h 
≤ 70 km; main shocks, N=3975), we get (for the optimal value T=182.5 and with NS=1000 
reshufflings) the following Moment-estimates: 
 
                                QT(0.98) = 8.34;       log10(ρT(8)) = -0.799; 
 
In order to evaluate the statistical scatter of these estimates, we use again the two-branch model 
with the four sets of parameters (15). We obtain the following sample estimates of the std with 
NS=100 reshufflings and ns=100 simulations: 
 
std(QT(0.98)) = 0.121;  std(log10(ρT(8))) = 0.114; 
 m1, = 7.5;  Mmax = 9.5;     
 m1, = 7.5;  Mmax = 10.5;    
std(QT(0.98)) = 0.180;  std(log10(ρT(8))) = 0.097; 
 m1, = 8.0;  Mmax = 9.5;        std(QT(0.98)) = 0.145;  std(log10(ρT(8))) = 0.081; 
 m1, = 8.0;  Mmax = 10.5;      std(QT(0.98)) = 0.172;  std(log10(ρT(8))) = 0.080; 
 
The relative scatter of these characteristics is rather small, so that we can use their average values 
for the evaluation of the scatter of the real sample estimates (24): 
 
                      std(QT(0.98)) ≅  0.16;        std(lg10(ρT(8))) ≅  0.1.                                           (25) 
 
     For the global Harvard catalog, we thus obtain the following estimates: 
 
                   QT(0.98) = 8.34 ± 0.16 ;       log10(ρT(8)) = -0.80 ± 0.1. 
 
It is important to notice that the scatters of QT(0.98) and  log10(ρT(8)) are much smaller than the 
scatter of the Mmax-estimate, whose upper 84%-bound differs from the median by 2 (see equation 
(23)), compared with 0.2 for QT(0.98). ), Fig. 9a-c illustrate the stability of the former two 
estimates with respect to the latter by showing three histograms of the corresponding sample 
estimates calculated for the two-branch model with parameters given by the third set in (15): m1, 
= 8.0;  Mmax = 9.5;  ξ = -0.2410;  s=0.3614. Observe that the Mmax-estimate goes up to the value 
20!

3.3 Changes in the estimates caused by taking into account the great Sumatra earthquake   
      24.12.04 , mW = 9.0. 
 
The occurrence of the great Sumatra earthquake offers an excellent opportunity for a so-to-speak 
out-of-sample test of our results obtained until now. In this section, we demonstrate the impact of 
the great Sumatra EQ 24.12.04 on the stability of our estimation procedure. Specifically, we take 
for the analysis the time period 01.01.1977- 16.06.2006, with a total duration of 10759 days. We 
have applied to this period the procedure of declustering described in Appendix A1 and obtained 
4193 main shocks. We have used the same value of T as earlier, namely T = 182.5 days. We 
obtained the following ME estimates of the GEV-parameters fitted to this new sample: 
 
                                    
 
As compared to our earlier estimates (17), the estimates of the parameters m, σ practically did 
not change whereas the ξ-estimate has changed dramatically. The same can be said for the 
estimates of the parameter Mmax for which we obtain the following 16% - 50% - 84% sample 
percentiles: 
 
                 qMmax(0.16) = 9.27;     qMmax(0.50) = 9.67;            qMmax(0.84) = 10.31.  
 
Recall that this scatter is due to the reshuffling procedure (NS = 1000 reshufflings) which 
provides only a lower bound of the full scatter which must includes the variation from sample to 
sample. We see that the new median estimate  qMmax(0.50) = 9.67   exceeds the previous one  
qMmax(0.50) = 8.70 obtained for the period 01.01.77-18.12.04 by almost one unit. This illustrates 
once more the instability of the estimation of the parameter Mmax. For comparison with Fig.8, 
Fig.10 shows the new histogram of the reshuffling estimates of Mmax. Compared with Fig. 8, the 
histogram of Mmax  has changed dramatically. For instance, the previous upper bound was 9.25 
whereas the new one is 15.4! This figure confirms once more the instability of the estimation of 
Mmax.

Let us now turn to the parameters introduced in section 2.3 characterizing the tail behavior of the 
magnitude distribution, which we have proposed and argued for on the basis of their good and 
stable behavior. They consist in the quantile QT(q) (defined in equation (12)) and the probability 
ρT(m*) (defined in equation (13))  for the GEV distribution fitted to the empirical distribution of 
the T-maxima. We obtain the following values for Q(0.98) and log10(ρT(8.0) ) for the new 
sample: 
 
                                  Qnew(0.98) = 8.57;     log10 (
 
which should be compared with old estimates (26): Q(0.98) = 8.34 ± 0.16;   log10(ρT(8.0) ) = 
 -0.80 ± 0.1. The new estimates differ only by approximately one std from the previous ones. 
This can be considered as quite admissible, taking into account the expected impact of the 
outstanding event of the great Sumatra earthquake. 
 
 
4  Summary and conclusions 
 
We have developed a new method for the statistical estimation of the tail of the distribution of 
earthquake sizes. The method focused on maxT – maximum magnitude observed in successive 
intervals of length T. We have suggested a new parametric model for the distribution of main 
shock magnitudes, which we referred to as the two-branch model (C1-C3) in Appendix C.  We 
found that the number of main events in the catalog (N = 3975) turned out to be insufficient in

order to use a direct estimation of the parameters of this model, due to the inherent instability of 
the estimation problem. This instability can be explained by the fact that only a small fraction of 
the empirical data populates the second branch described by three unknown parameters (m1 ; α ; 
σ ). In this vein, Pisarenko and Sornette (2004) estimated by an independent method that, for the 
global Harvard catalogs for shallow earthquakes, about 17 events in the tail of the distribution 
departs significantly from the pure G-R distribution. Thus, even a sample size of about  N = 
4000 can be insufficient for the reliable estimation of these parameters and a degenerate behavior 
of the model as explained in Appendix C can occur. This instability is made even more apparent, 
if need be, by our comparison of the estimates of Mmax over the period 01.01.77-18.12.04 with 
that over the period 01.01.1977- 16.06.2006 which includes the great Sumatra EQ 24.12.04, mW 
= 9.0: we find that the median of the GEV distribution of Mmax increases almost by one unit 
magnitude when including the impact of the Sumatra earthquake, while the interval of maximal 
admissible Mmax jumps from 9.25 to 15.4! 
 
describing the tail of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes, namely, through maxT that we 
called the set of T-maxima, i.e., the n maximum magnitudes in n windows of duration equal to T 
days. We have confirmed the known fact that, for samples of small and intermediate size ( n ≤ 
50), the Moment estimates of the GEV-parameters are more efficient than the Maximum 
Likelihood estimates (see Hosking et al. 1985, Coles and Dixon 1999). We have established that 
in our estimation problem for small sample size the Moment estimates are slightly more efficient 
than the Probability-Weighted Moment estimates (see Christopeit 1994, Embrechts et al. 1997). 
We have suggested a method for the determination of the optimal choice of the T-value 
minimizing the Mean Square Error of the estimation of the form parameter of the GEV 
distribution approximating the sample distribution of T-maxima. This approach makes possible 
the Moment-estimation of the form parameter of the tail distribution, although a considerable 
uncertainty of the estimation procedure still persists. Perhaps, more representative catalogs of 
earthquake magnitudes can help increase the sample size and make the estimation more reliable. 
But generalizing the suggested methods to magnitude catalogs demands some further work, in 
particular to take into account the discrete character of the magnitudes and the distortion 
associated with the time evolution of the completeness of the magnitude catalogs. Perhaps, even 
some historical catalogs based on the registration of seismic intensity can be used to further 
increase the sample size, but this question needs a more detailed study.  
      We now summarize our main results. We have derived the following Moment-estimates for 
the GEV distribution of earthquake magnitudes fitted to the sample distribution of T-maxima of 
the global Harvard catalog of main shocks over the time period 1977-2004 and 1977-2006:

     We have suggested two stable statistical characteristics of the tail of the distribution of 
earthquake magnitudes: the quantile QT(q) of a high probability level q for the T-maxima, and 
the probability of exceedence of a high threshold magnitude   ρT(m*) = P{ mk ≥ m*}. The 
statistical estimates of these characteristics are more stable than the estimate of Mmax . We 
obtained the following sample estimates for the global Harvard catalog: 
 
    QT(0.98) = 8.34 ± 0.16 ;       log10(ρT(8)) = -0.80 ± 0.1;    (ρT(8))=0.13-0.2)                     (31)

The relative scatter of these estimates is much smaller than the scatter of the Mmax-estimate and 
remains robust even when included the impact of the great Sumatra earthquake. We would like 
to note that using the set of mmax(T) as suggested in our paper with the estimation of the GEV-
parameters permits to evaluate all statistical characteristics (including Q(q) and ρ(m*) ) related to 
the future time intervals that are multiples of T, since for T1 = r⋅T the distribution function of  
mmax(T)  is  [GEV(x | m,s,ξ)]r.

APPENDIX A: Elimination of aftershocks. 

 
     In order to get more reliable estimates, it is necessary decluster catalogs to remove the 
strongest time dependence between so-called aftershocks and main shocks so as to approach 
better the condition of independence necessary for the applications of the theorems of extreme 
value theory.  
The method of declustering that we use is standard. We start by identifying the largest event in a 
catalog, whose time, location and magnitude are denoted as (time t, location (φ0, λ0), magnitude 
M). Then, we exclude all events in the time-space window: 
 
                                     (t;   t +10-0.31+0.46 M ); 
                             R(φ, λ; φ0, λ0) ≤ 10-0.85+0.46 M ;                                                                       (A1) 
 
where R is the distance in km between points (φ, λ) and (φ0, λ0).  The window (A1) was taken 
from (Knopoff et al.1982). After the first elimination, we identify the next largest event of the 
remaining earthquakes (excluding the previous one already accounted for). And we apply the 
same pruning with the same rule for the space-time window associated with this second largest 
event of remaining earthquakes. And we iterate until the algorithm stops.  

If this algorithm for the elimination of aftershocks was perfect, we should obtain a Poisson 
distribution of main shocks (provided of course that the so-called main shocks can be assumed to 
be independently occurring according to a constant Poisson rate). Therefore, a natural procedure 
to check for the quality of the algorithm eliminating the aftershocks is to test whether the 
declustered catalog obeys the Poisson statistics. For this, we use two characteristics: 
 

1.  The standard Kolmogorov distance between the sample distribution of occurrence times 

of events (where the times are normalized to unity); 

2.  The ratio µ = (sample variance)/(sample mean) for the numbers of events in intervals of 
length T (We took T = 50 days for the experiments presented below). Under the null 
hypothesis of a Poisson distribution, this ratio is distributed approximately as a Chi-
square random variable with K-1 degrees of freedom, where K is the number of such 
intervals of length T (Cox and Lewis, 1966). In our experiments,  K=203. 

 
We used the Harvard catalog of seismic moments over the time period 01.01.1977-16.05.2006. 
Let us consider first the magnitude range mW ≥ 5.0. The sample distribution of normalized 
occurrence times (which for a Poisson process should be uniform) is shown on fig. A1. One can 
see clear deviation from the Poisson process. The inset also shows that there is a significant trend 
in the number of recorded earthquakes over time, probably resulting from the improvement of 
the recording system. In addition, the large peak at the end of the time series of event number, 
followed by a sharp drop, is associated with the Sumatra earthquake with mW =9.0  of December 
24, 2004. The two statistics obtained for this time series are µ  = 13.97 (probability of exceeding 
this value under the Poisson hypothesis is practically zero; for a Poisson process, theoretically µ  
= 1). We also obtain KD=13.97 (outside of tabulated results, i.e., the probability of exceeding 
this value under the Poisson hypothesis is also practically zero).  We thus conclude that the null 
Poisson hypothesis is totally rejected for this catalog over the time period 01.01.1977-16.05.2006 
and magnitude range mW ≥ 5.0. 
 
remove the influence of the Sumatra EQ with mW =9.0 which occurred on 24.12.04,  we obtain µ   
= 7.90, KD=14.62 (outside of table) again very strongly rejecting the null hypothesis of a 
Poisson process.  
 
 
 

For the same magnitude range, when we restrict to the time interval 01.01.77-20.12.04 to

We now consider the Harvard catalog of seismic moments over the time period 01.01.77-

Fig. A1: the trend in the inset almost disappears but there are still significant deviations from the 
Poisson distribution, with obvious time clustering associated with aftershocks. This translates 
into the following statistics µ  = 2.14 (probability of exceeding this value under Poisson 
hypothesis is practically zero), KD=3.15 (still outside of table), thus rejecting again strongly the 
Poisson null hypothesis. 
 
Fig. A3 shows the results obtained using the algorithm removing the aftershocks described 
above. From n=7521 shallow events in the time interval 01.01.77-20.12.04 with mW ≥ 5.5, we 
retain 3975 main events (3975/7521 ≅ 52.9% so that approximately half of the events are 
triggered according to this algorithm), and we obtain µ  = 1.12 (probability of exceeding this 
value under the Poisson hypothesis is 10.7%), KD=0.836 (probability of exceeding this value is 
about 50%). The inset exhibits no visible trend. These different diagnostic suggest that the 
algorithm removing the aftershocks can be considered as satisfactory.

 APPENDIX B: Comparison of three methods of estimation of the parameters (m, s, ξ) 
of the GEV distribution function: the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE), the 
Moment Estimates (ME) and estimates based on Probability-Weighted Moments. 

 
        Consider a sample (x1,…,xn)  generated with the distribution function  GEV(x |m,s,ξ): 
 

       GEV(x |m,s,ξ) = exp( -[1 + 

]-1/ξ );          1 + 

 > 0;    ξ < 0.            (B1) 

    
We consider the problem of the estimation of the parameters (m,s,ξ), with three well-known 
methods of statistical estimation of parameters: the Maximum Likelihood Estimates (MLE), the 
Moment Estimates (ME) and estimates based on Probability-Weighted Moments (PWM, see e.g. 
Embrechts et al. 1997). Since the support of the distribution GEV(x) depends on the unknown 
parameters as defined in (B1), the regularity of the MLE and its asymptotic efficiency properties 
are not obvious. In (Smith 1985) it was shown that the MLE are asymptotically regular at least 
for ξ > -0.5. But for small and moderate sample sizes (n ≅ 10 ÷ 100), the MLE turned out to be 
less efficient than the ME and the PWM estimate (see Christopeit 1994, Coles and Dixon 1999). 
We have compared these three MLE, ME and PWM estimates on small and moderate samples 
and confirm that the MLE is less efficient than both other competing methods, and besides, the 
ME is slightly superior than the PWM estimate. 
      Le us recall the definitions of the ME and PWM estimate. Let us denote the first three 
centered sample moments as follows: 
 

     M1 = 

xk;            M2 = 

(xk- M1)2;              M3 = 

(xk- M1)3.                 (B2) 

 
 The corresponding theoretical moments for the GEV-distribution (B1) are: 
 

                  µ1 = m – s/ξ +  Gamma(1 - ξ);                                                                             (B3) 

                 µ2 = s2/ξ2 [ Gamma(1 - 2ξ) – (Gamma(1 - ξ))2 ]; 
 
                 µ3 = s3 [-2(Gamma(- ξ))3 -  Gamma(- ξ) Gamma(- 2ξ) – 

Gamma(- 3ξ) ]; 

 
In the ME method, we identify the theoretical moments with their sample analogs and solve the 
resulting equations with respect to the unknown parameters: 
 

                 m – 

 +  Gamma(1 - ξ) = M1 ;                                                                     (B4) 

                 

[ Gamma(1 - 2ξ) – (Gamma(1 - ξ))2 ] = M2 ;                                            (B5) 

      s3 [-2(Gamma(- ξ))3 -  Gamma(- ξ) Gamma(- 2ξ) – 

Gamma(- 3ξ) ] = M3 .        (B6) 

 
We can solve explicitly equations (B4)-(B5) with respect to m,s:

smx)(!"smx)(!"n1!=nk1n1!=nk1n1!=nk1!s!623!!s!s22!s!623!                      sME = [ 

]1/2                                                (B7) 

 

 

                     mME =  

 -  Gamma(1 - ξ) + M1 .                                                                     (B8) 

 
Inserting (B7) into equation (B6), we have only one 1D equation for the numerical search of the 
solution for ξ. This can be effectuated by the most reliable and simple grid calculation. 
      In the PWM method, we identify the theoretical expectations  
 
                         γk = E[ X {GEV(X)}k];     k=0,1,2;                                                                 (B9) 
 
with their sample analogs  
 

                        gk =  

xj {Fn(xj)}k ;       k=0,1,2,                                                             (B11) 

 
where Fn is the sample distribution function calculated from the sample (x1,…,xn). The 
theoretical expectations (B9) are given by: 
 

           γk = 

 ;                              k=0,1,2.                    (B12) 

 
Again, the solution of the system of equations, γk = gk , k=0,1,2, can be reduced to the numerical 
search of the solution of the 1D equation: 
 

                                             

 = 

.                                                                   (B13)  

 
We denote this solution as ξPWM . Then, the two other PWM-estimates are expressed as follows: 
 

                         sPWM = 

;                                                          (B14) 

                                          

                         mPWM =  g0 + 

.                                                    (B15) 

 
The MLE are found as the parameter values (m,s,ξ) maximizing the likelihood L: 
 

                    L = 

[1+

]-1-1/ξ exp{ - [1+

]-1/ξ }.                          (B16) 

 
Thus, the MLE involves a 3D numerical search, which is rather inconvenient from a 
computational point of view.  
Let us now present the comparison between the results obtained with the three estimation 
 
methods, when applied to synthetic data sets of increasing sizes generated with parameters which 
are typical of what can be expected for real earthquakes. We generated samples of sizes n = 10; 
15; 25; 50; 200 with the parameters m=7.5; s=0.4; ξ = -0.2. These parameters correspond,

     For small and moderate sample sizes (n ≅ 10 ÷ 50), the MLE are less efficient than the ME 
and the PWM estimators, whereas in turn the ME is slightly better than the PWM estimator. This 
difference disappears for larger sample size (n = 200). 
      There exists one additional method for the estimation of the parameters (m,s,ξ) suggested in 
(Kijko and Graham 1998, Kijko 1999, Kijko et al. 2001). This method is based on equating the 
expectation of the observed maximum magnitude 

 as well as the expectation of the powers 

]k , k=2,3,… of the observed maximum magnitude to their sample values. Thus, taking 
, we get the following system of 

[
into account that [F(x)]n is the distribution function of 
equations determining the estimates of the parameters: 
 

  E[

]k = 

zk d[F(z)]n  = [Mmax]k - k

 zk-1 [F(z)]n  dz = [

]k , k=1,2,3,…      (B17) 

 converges 

 - Mmax) ~ nξ,  (ξ < 0),                                                      (B18) 

 
Kijko calls the set of equation (B17) under the name generic equations. Since 
in probability to the true value  Mmax as n tends to infinity, the generic equations provide 
consistent estimates. But we should note that for our situation with a distribution function 
GEV(x) with a support limited from above, we have (see Embrechts et al. 1997) 
 
                                           (
 
  whereas for the moment estimators  
 
                                             (γk - gk) ~ n-1/2 ,  
 
This convergence (B19) is faster than (B18) since usually for real situations ξ ≅ -0.2 ÷ - 0.3. 
Thus, the generic equations provide less efficient estimators than all three types of estimators 
discussed above. This conclusion was confirmed by numerical examples with simulations.

 APPENDIX C: Simulation experiments on a DF for earthquake magnitudes with two

C.1 Definition of the two-branch model with a maximum upper-bound 
 
In order to estimate the biases associated with the finite sample sizes in the presence of a 
transition from a pure G-R law to a faster decay of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes up 
to an absolute upper magnitude bound Mmax, it is instructive to construct an explicit model 
having these properties and study how extreme value theory and our methodology performs on 
it. In this way, we are going to be able to propose reliable corrections for systematic biases which 
improve significantly upon our estimations of Mmax and other characteristics of the extreme tail 
behavior. We thus consider the following probability density f(x), consisting of two branches: 
 
                                                                C f1(x);     m0 ≤ x ≤ m1 ; 
                                                     f(x) =                                                                                (C1) 
                                                                 C f2(x);     m1 ≤ x ≤  Mmax; 
 
 The density f(x) is zero outside the interval (m0 ; Mmax), C is a normalizing constant. 
 The branches should satisfy the following properties: 

The first branch  f1(x) should be the pure Gutenberg-Richer law; 
The second branch f2(x) should decrease to zero at some finite upper point; 

(i) 
(ii) 
(iii)  At the point m1 of connection of the two branches, the density f(x) and its first 

derivative should be continuous. 

 

 

(C2) 

The density f(x) defined in (C1) has the shape of a  “duck beak”: it may extend to a quite distant 
end point Mmax at a very low level, so that events with magnitudes close to Mmax may occur very, 
very seldom. 
In accordance with the first condition, we write 
 
                           f1(x) = β exp( -β(x- m0) );     β  > 0;    m0 ≤ x ≤  m1 . 
 
We have decided to parameterize the second branch in the following form:  
 
              f2(x) = C1(1/σ)[1- α(x- m1)/σ]1/α -1 ;      α > 0;   m1 ≤ x ≤  Mmax = m1 + σ/α ,   
 
where C1 is a constant. We consider the parameters β, m0 as known, whereas the parameters C1, 
α, σ, m1 (or Mmax) are free for fitting. The third condition (continuity of density and its first 
derivative) introduces two equations for these four parameters. Thus, we are left with only two 
parameters for fitting. We can choose any two from these four parameters for fitting, e.g.  m1 , 
Mmax. In this case, the other parameters are expressed as a function of β, m0, m1 , Mmax as 
 
                                          α  = 1/(1+β( Mmax- m1); 
 
                                          σ =( Mmax- m1)/ (1+β( Mmax- m1); 
 
                                           C1=βσ exp(-β( m1-m0)).

Let us illustrate the relevance of our two-branch model (C1-C3) by exploring its ability to fit the 
global Harvard catalog (01.01.77-18.12.04; mW ≥ 5.5; h ≤ 70 km; main shocks, N=3975). The 
Figures C1-C3 show how three different pairs of the parameters (m1, Mmax) can approximate the 
sample tail  1 – F(x) of the catalog. All these pairs give very close likelihood values, so none of 
them has an appreciable advantage over the others in terms of the statistical likelihood. One can 
observe that these three fits look rather satisfactorily in spite of the fact that the corresponding 
parameters differ considerably. This means that the estimation of the two-branch model (C1-C3) 
is rather uncertain. Unsurprisingly, the problem comes from the fact that the data sample has 
relatively few observations N(m1) exceeding m1 (which provide a direct constraint in the tail 
behavior):  
 
       N(m1=7.0) = 166 (Fig.C1);   N(m1=7.5) = 59 (Fig.C2);  N(m1=8.0) = 9 (Fig.C3)          (C5) 
 
This means that this uncertainty and the degenerate nature of the fit is inherent. 
       
 
C.3 Degenerate behavior of the estimates of the parameters (m1, Mmax).  
 
It is necessary to discuss an unpleasant but unavoidable property of the estimates of the 
parameters (m1, Mmax) of the two-branch model (C1-C3):  if, for a fixed sample size N, the true  
m1 is too close to the true Mmax,  then the Moment-estimates of these parameters merge with a 
large probability, i.e. the difference between these estimates become very small. As a 

 

36 

consequence, one is not able to detect the second branch which reduces to the upper bound Mmax. 
If one considers samples generated with a fixed difference (Mmax - m1), small sample sizes N will 
not be able to separate between m1 and Mmax but, by increasing N, we can always reach a 
sufficiently large N such that Mmax  and  m1  can be separated by the ME method. It turns out that 
for n=3975 (sample size of the main shocks in the global Harvard catalog, 1977-2004), the ME 
method is able to distinguish with good reliability the differences (Mmax - m1) ≅ 1.5-2 and larger.  
 
We have performed extensive simulations for different sample sizes, N=1300 (number of 
main shocks at shallow depths in subduction zones, 1977-2000), N=4000, N=10000, N=20000 
for different  Mmax =9.5; 10.0; 10.5; 11.0, and  for 6.5 ≤  m1 < Mmax . These simulations show 
that the probability P{ Mmax - max(xk) < 0.1} for the difference Mmax - max(xk) to be small is 
significant (larger than 0.1) for  
 
          m1 >  6.5    (N=1300); 
          m1 > 7.25   (N=4000);                                                                                             (C9) 
          m1 > 7.5     (N=10000); 
          m1 > 8.0     (N=20000). 
 
Looking at the empirical sample tails in Figs. C1-C3, we could conclude visually (of course it is 
not a strict conclusion) that the magnitude (an estimate of m1) beyond which the curvature 
corresponding to the second branch of the distribution given by equations (C1-C3) becomes 
significant can hardly be less than 7.0. Reading from the set of inequalities (C9), we would 
conclude that the estimation of  m1 for a sample of N=1287 events as in the subduction zones is 
practically hopeless, whereas there remains still some hope to estimate m1 for the global catalog 
with N=3975 main shocks. The average number   Av#(mW > m1) of observations exceeding m1 
which are needed to make P{ Mmax - max(xk) < 0.1} small (less than 0.1) is found approximately 
to be Av#(mW > m1) >~ 100. For the empirical global Harvard catalog, the 100-th order statistics 
is mW =7.23 which is slightly less that mW =7.25 shown in the set of inequalities (C9) as the 
approximate threshold that needs to be passed in order to distinguish between Mmax  and m1 for 
N=4000. When Av#(mW > m1) >< 100 or equivalently when the inequalities (C9) are obeyed, 
we observe considerable biases in the median and quantile estimates of Mmax  and of m1.  
The overall conclusion of these tests is that the direct estimation of the parameters of the 
 
two-branch model  (C1-C3) using the catalogue of magnitudes is questionable even for sample 
sizes N=4000 comparable with the global Harvard catalog, and becomes hopeless for the smaller 
data size N=1300 corresponding to the main shocks at shallow depths in subduction zones. 
Similar limitations are observed for other parameterization (Pisarenko and Sornette, 2003; 
2004). We are therefore forced to use another approach to estimate the parameters describing the 
tail of the distribution of earthquake magnitudes. It turns out that working with the sample of n 
T-maxima of magnitudes in windows of size T provides more stable and reliable estimates. The 
two-branch model (C1-C3) will be used further only for estimating the scatter of the statistical 
characteristics (std and quantiles) of the estimates of empirical samples by means of synthetic 
simulations, and not for the direct estimation of the tail parameters.

Abstract 

The European quest for the hard paste porcelain lasted until about 1710, when the 

first production unit was built at Meissen in Saxony. Although, it is generally believed 

that  Böttger  discovered  the  European  porcelain  technology,  this  work  shows  that  the 

German porcelain quest was a State affair; a collective project directed by Tschirnhaus 

and supported by August the Strong. It also aims to shed light to the reasons that led to 

Tschirnhaus’s  relative  oblivion.  Considering  three  distinct  temporal  stages,  we  re-         

-examine the roles of the main contributors to the porcelain project, referring to the role 

of the Mercantilism system and to the philosophical roots of Tschirnhaus’s method. 

1. The Trigger Conditions: Mercantilism, Baroque and Modern Science 

The  German  discovery  of  porcelain  production  techniques  was  probably  the  most 

emblematic  technical  achievement  of  Baroque  period,  aimed  to  fulfil  the  Baroque 

aesthetical  opulence  and  the  luxurious  way  of  life  of  the  noble  class,  under  the 

economical  constraints  of  the  Mercantilist  policy.  This  quest  should  be  considered  as 

one  of  the  earliest  successes  of  modern  experimental  method,  as  outlined  by  Francis 

Bacon in Novum Organum (1620), emphasizing the experimentalist approach, while the 

importance  of  mathematics  was  underestimated.  Bacon’s  philosophy  was  highly 

1 

 

 

influential  on  scientists  like  Robert  Boyle  and  Robert  Hooke  (Solís,  1985).  This 

approach  opposes  to  Cartesianism,  defending  that  the  route  for  scientific  knowledge 

should  rely  on  mathematical  reasoning.  Along  with  Huygens  and  Leibniz,  Ehrenfried 

Walter von Tschirnhaus (1651-1708) tried to conciliate these two apparently opposing 

methods. This development led to modern science (Hooykaas, 1986) and was crucial to 

the success of the porcelain research project.  

2. Chronological Stages of Hard-Paste Porcelain Research Project 

  August  the  Strong  (1670-1733),  Elector  of  Saxony  and  King  of  Poland,  gave 

Tschirnhaus  the  assignment  of  searching  the  whole  Saxon  territory  for  deposits  of 

precious  stones,  while  developing  methods  of  polishing  and  lapping  these  valuable 

resources. At the same time, he pressed Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682-1719) to make 

gold.  These  two  projects  merged  in  the  hard-porcelain  industrial  project,  were  three 

conceptually distinct stages can be distinguish. 

2.1. Laboratory research: technology, raw materials and eutectics (1682-1706) 

 

Tschirnhaus  was  born  in  April  1651  in  Kieslingswalde  (Germany).  He  studied  in 

Leiden  University  from  1668  to  1674.  In  1673-74,  he  was  introduced  to  Spinoza  in 

Leiden.  In  1675  he  began  a  “knight’s  tour”,  meeting  Papin,  Boyle,  Oldenburg,  John 

Wallis and John Collins in Britain. In the same year, he met Leibniz and Huygens, and 

continued  his  learning  travel  in  Paris,  where  he  met  Colbert1.  In  1676,  he  went  to 

southern  France  and  Italy,  returning  to  his  estate  in  Kieslingswalde  in  1679  (Leinsle, 

1997). He went again to France in 1701-02, where he visited the St. Cloud soft-paste 

porcelain  factory  (Raffo,  1982),  becoming  a  member  of  the  Acadèmie  Royale  des 

Sciences  (Paris)  in  1682.  He  developed  the  idea  of  the  worthiness  of  matching 

2 

 

 

mathematics  and  physics  in  his  chief  philosophical  work,  Medicina  Mentis  (1687). 

Through  the  1680’s,  he  applied  his  scientific  knowledge  to  the  development  of 

industrial  processes,  focusing  at  the  manufacture  of  glass  and  porcelain.  He  also 

established  the  first  Saxon  glass  manufactures  and  developed  polishing  technology 

(Bauke,  1990).  By  1682,  he  studied  theoretically  the  envelope  of  light  beams  emitted 

from  a  point  source  after  reflection  on  a  parabolic  surface  (O'Connor  and  Robertson, 

1997), as a preliminary step towards the development of large burning lens and mirrors  

(Hofmann,  1981).  The  last  ones  were  an  improved  version  of  the  mirrors  developed 

earlier  by  François  Villette,  in  France  (Klinckowstroen,  1965).  The  use  of  such 

equipments allowed him to reach temperatures within 1500-2000ºC, higher than what 

he could achieve in contemporary combustion furnaces (Bauke, 1990). The method was 

welcome in laboratory research because the samples could be easily observed and many 

trials  could  run  in  a  short  time.  From  1693-94  onwards,  Tschirnhaus  found  that 

porcelain  could  melt,  and  studied  the  refractory  properties  of  several  possible  raw 

minerals  (Leinsle,  1997).  Understanding  eutectics,  he  discovered  that  porcelain  could 

be obtained from a mixture of clay and fusible minerals (flux). Tschirnhaus conducted 

most  of this  research  guided  by his prior knowledge  of glass technology, whereby he 

seemingly  believed  that  porcelain  was  a  glass2.  By  1699,  he  actually  obtained 

“porcelain” by melting and cooling mixtures of raw materials (Bauke, 1990).  

 

Tschirnhaus started the porcelain research long before Böttger joined the quest, as 

his assistant, in 1705 (Goder and Walter, 1982). Böttger was born in 1682 at Schleiz. 

After  he  started  working  as  a  pharmacist  apprentice  in  Berlin,  he  devoted  himself  to 

alchemy (Hofmann, 1982). In 1701, he made his first demonstration in the presence of 

trustworthy witnesses. He pretended to transmute two silver coins into gold. After his 

3 

 

“success”, the Prussian King, tried to lock him as a treasure, but he managed to escape 

to Saxony. However, his fame preceded him, and August the Strong kept him watched 

and  confined  in  Albrechtsburg  Castle  (Meissen),  trying  to  exploit  his  “gold  maker” 

skills. Later on, as no gold was forthcoming, August directed him to porcelain research. 

2.2. Scale-up: from laboratory to manufacture (1706-1710) 
 

After  the  preliminary  laboratory  trials  provided  promising  porcelain  samples,  a 

scale-up procedure began. It started in 1706, when August ordered metallurgist experts 

to  be  hired  in  the  Freiberg  region,  since  they  held  valuable  knowledge  on  thermal 

processes and kilns. The Freiberg Mining Counsellor, Gottfried Pabst von Ohain (1656-

1729), expert in mineralogy and metallurgy, was chosen to direct the iron-metallurgist 

workers  hired  in  January  1706  (Goder  and  Walter,  1982,  p.75).  Tschirnhaus  was 

godfather of Ohain's son (Westfall, 1995); therefore, he supported Ohain's cooperation. 

Ohain, contributed with his vast practical knowledge of ores and minerals, as an expert 

furnace  constructor,  and  developed  formulas  for  overglaze  enamels.  Similarly  to 

Tschirnhaus,  his  contribution  has  been  largely  disregarded.  Ohain  provided  Böttger 

with selected mineral samples, which were otherwise inaccessible to him. 

In September 1707, three cellar vaults were dedicated to porcelain production at the 

Dresden  fortress,  providing  an  intermediate  level  between  laboratory  and  factory’s 

production  scales.  The  production  of  red  stoneware  was  soon  started,  from  iron-rich 

refractory clay mixed with a fusible flux fired to very high temperature. This stoneware 

was  however  extremely  hard.  Thus,  it  was  cut,  polished  and  wheel-engraved  like  a 

semi-precious stone, with the aid of equipment developed by Tschirnhaus. This period 

was characterized by the decline of Tschirnhaus’s influence, and by the abandon of the 

former  Tchirnhaus’s  program,  based  on  the  use  of  sun  light  kilns,  which  were 

4 

 

appropriate  for  laboratory  trials  but  unsuitable  to  be  scaled-up  to  the  factory’s  level. 

This  decay  was  compensated  by  the  rising  influence  of  the  two  new  members  who 

joined  the  porcelain  “contubernium”  (task  force),  Pabst  von  Ohain  and  Dr. 

Bartholomaei  (1670-1742).  The  latter  was  a  medicine  physician  and  naturalist  who, 

working from 1707 onwards carried out numerous trials of paste preparation, intended 

to  find  the  most  favourable  clay  raw  materials  among  those  found  in  Saxony  region 

(Raffo, 1982). The relative shares of the chosen clays were mostly established by him. 

A  protocol  dated  from  15.01.1708  certifies  the  invention  of  the  European  hard  paste 

porcelain,  establishing  the  transition  from  the  laboratory  trial  stage  to  the  production 

scale maturity. This document has been attributed either to Böttger (Hofmann, 1980, p. 

35) or to Bartholomaei (Bauke, 1990). 

In  1708-09,  the  first  Saxon  white  clay  (kaolin)  was  found  in  Erzgebirge.  This 

discovery  is  often  attributed  to  Bötger,  but  the  research  was  actually  conducted  by 

Ohain  (Bauke,  1990)  and  Bartholomaei  (Goder  and  Walter,  1982).  This  finding  was 

crucial for the success of the manufacture of white porcelain. New deposits were found 

later at Aue, near Schneeberg, in Saxony, and a mixture of the two clays with calcified 

alabaster and white silica was found particularly successful (Raffo, 1982, p. 84). After 

Tschirnhaus’  death  (14.10.1708),  Böttger  wrote  a  report  to  the  Elector  (28.03.1709), 

claiming that he had prepared “good white porcelain” equivalent or even better than the 

Chinese one (Raffo, 1982). The official start-up date of the porcelain manufacture (at 

Dresden) dates from 23.01.1710, when the Saxon Court Chancellery issued a "Supreme 

Decree" in Latin, French, German and Dutch, announcing the discovery to the World. 

For security reasons, a Decree from 7.03.1710 transferred the factory to Albrechtsburg 

(Meissen), being officially opened in August 6, the same year (Hofmann, 1980, p. 36).

2.3. Full scale production and improvement of decorating techniques (1710 onwards)  

  Although the porcelain manufactory at Meissen started the production of porcelain 

in 1710, the decoration was poor, and the first significant sales only took place at the 

Leipzig Easter Fair in 1713 (Goder and Walter, 1982). The nine years held between the 

manufacture  start-up  and  Böttger’s  death,  in  March  1719,  were  characterized  by  a 

constant  search  for  improvement  of  the  manufacturing  techniques.  A  wide  variety  of 

enamel pigments were developed, obtained from powdered metallic oxides. 

3. The Priority Dispute: Böttger or Tschirnhaus? 

The  inspector  of  Meissen  manufactory,  Johann  Melchior  Steinbrück  (1673-1723), 

was  largely  responsible  for  the  initial  promotion  of  Böttger  as  a  genius,  to  whom  he 

claimed that all credit of the discovery should be given (Bárta, 1963). He stated, in a 

laudatory  text  (Steinbrück,  1713),  that  his  «inventoribus  rerum»  would  hardly  be 

repeated in a hundred years! Steinbrück was a close relative of Böttger (his brother in 

law), and under Steinbrück’s suggestion (1715), Augustus chose Böttger as director of 

porcelain  manufacturing  and  attributed  him  the  title  of  Baron.  The  secrecy  policy 

followed by Augustus also contributed for the relative oblivion of Tschirnhaus’s role, 

since early documents were secret. Earlier historians, following Steinbrück, emphasized 

Böttger’s contribution instead of Tschirnhaus’s, starting a chain that still echoes.  

Bárta  (1963)  pointed  that  religious  intolerance  could  have  also  played  a  role  on 

Tschirnhaus’s oblivion. Some of his ancestors were considered to be sympathetic with 

the  catholic  religion,  particularly  his  father’s  uncle  living  in  Prague  (visited  by  his 

father  in  1637),  since  the  catholic  religion  was  sustained  by  the  majority  of  the 

Bohemians  (while  in  Saxony  the  Lutheranism  was  officially  supported).  It  can  be 

6 

 

argued, however, that this Catholic’s influence suspicion did not hinder his earlier fair 

relationship with the Court. Therefore, a more important contribution should be sought 

in  the  reaction  of  the  orthodox  Lutheranism  against  the  Enlightenment.  This 

contribution  probably  was  reinforced  by  a  similar  reaction  from  the  influential  secret 

brotherhood of the Rosy Cross3. 

Tschirnhaus  was  considered  as  one  of  the  most  influential  leaders  of  the  German 

Enlightenment  (Winter,  1960),  a  cultural  movement  that  criticized  the  more  orthodox 

Lutheranism  (Wolter,  1971).  His  mind  echoed  the  new  tendencies  of  European 

philosophy, as Cartesianism (Künzel, 1989a, b) and Spinozism (Künzel, 1989b; Wurtz, 

1991; Vermij, 1991). These tendencies were not welcome in the orthodox Lutheranism 

circles  (Wolter,  1971).  Particularly,  Wolff  (a  Leibniz’  disciple)  was  dismissed  from 

Halle  University  (1721),  and  later,  Christian  Thomasius  accused  Tschirnhaus  of 

Spinozism (Monatsgesprächen, 1688), and therewith of atheism (Leinsle, 1997; Wurtz, 

1980).  As  a  symptomatic  consequence  of  this  opposition,  we  see  that  from  1704 

onwards, Tschirnhaus held a dispute with the preacher Kellner von Zinnendorf (1665-

1738) (Sabelleck, 1998; Knobloch, 2003).  

As regards to Böttger, his alchemistic skills have been seemingly better tolerated by 

the  Lutheran  orthodoxy,  since  alchemy  was  relatively  well  accepted  in  Protestant 

circles.

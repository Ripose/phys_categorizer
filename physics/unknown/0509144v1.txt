ABSTRACT 

Spiral  galaxies  are  axi-symmetric  objects  showing  2D-chirality  when 

projected onto a plane. Features in common with tetrahedral molecules are pointed out, 

in  particular  the  existence  of  a  preferred  chiral  modality  for  genetic  galaxies  as  in 

aminoacids  and  sugars.  Environmental  effects  can  influence  the  intrinsic  chirality  of 

originally isolated stellar systems so that a progressive loss of chirality is recognised in 

the Hubble morphological sequence of galaxies. 

KEY  WORDS:  chirality;  enantiomers;  Hubble  sequence;  spiral  galaxies;  tetrahedral

INTRODUCTION 

As a general definition, enantiomers are objects  or physical systems  whose mirror images are not 

superimposable  as  hands  and  shoes.  In  chemistry,  they  are  molecules  with  the  same  formula,  the 

same  atomic  connectivity  and  the  same  distances  between  corresponding  atoms,  but  with  non-

superimposable mirror images. This feature is easily recognized in a wide range of natural systems 

and  it  is  generally  reported  under  the  standard  of  chiral  symmetry.  While  it  is  well-known  that 

elementary  particles  (e.  g.  L-neutrinos)  or  organic  molecules  (e.  g.  L-aminoacids  and  D-sugars) 

have  a  preferential  chiral  characterization,  it  has  to  be  assessed  if  extremely  large  macroscopic 

systems can share this feature. Spiral galaxies are among these systems and it is important to stress 

that chirality could be the imprint of some primordial microscopic evolutionary process, which led 

to  the  today  observed  cosmic  large  scale  structure.  In  fact,  a  commonly  accepted  paradigm  in 

1

 

 
 
 

 

cosmology  asserts  that  initial  quantum  fluctuations  have  been  hugely  enhanced  during  the 

inflationary  epoch,  giving  rise  to  the  observed  galaxies  and  clusters  of  galaxies,  which  are  the 

largest structures in the Universe.1 The order of magnitude of such an expansion ranges from 1050 to 

1060 so that, in principle, every microscopic process could have been enlarged to huge astrophysical 

scales.1  On  the  other  hand,  chirality  of  elementary  particles  plays  a  fundamental  role  in  physics 

being  related  to  symmetry  breaking  which  led  to  the  violation  of  some  fundamental  conservation 

laws as CP invariance. It is therefore legitimate to ask for remnants of these processes not only in 

microscopic phenomena, but also in macroscopic ones, due to the cosmological expansion, with the 

perspective of a unitary view of physics.2 

In this contribution, we develop some considerations by which spiral galaxies can be framed under 

the  standard  of  molecular  chirality.  Some  recent  studies  have  shown  that  chiral  tetrahedral 

molecules  are  algebraically  described  by  orthogonal  groups3  and  the  approach  gives  evidence  of 

common features  with those of elementary  particles.  In particular,  molecules and particles can be 

represented  by  unitary  quaternions  with  analogous  dynamics.4  Spiral  galaxies  are  endowed  with 

these features and a defined chiral modality could be a genetic property which galaxies are going to 

loose due to environmental effects. 

The article is organized as follows: in Sec. 2, orthogonal groups are discussed, showing as they are 

naturally suitable to describe chiral objects. In particular, tetrahedral molecules and particles can be 

described by the O(4) group. Sec. 3 is devoted to the spiral structure of galaxies. From an algebraic 

point  of  view,  their  chiral  features  as  trailing  and  leading  arms  are  recovered  by  the  O(2)  group. 

Environmental effects and evolution toward achiral systems in the Hubble sequence are discussed 

in Sec. 4. An outlook of the discussed concept is given in Sec. 5. 

 

 

CHIRALITY BY ORTHOGONAL GROUPS 

In any way it is conceived, chirality is always related to the fact that structurally identical objects 

have non-superimposable mirror images. According to Ruch,5 we have a genuine form of chirality, 

the so-called handed chirality (shoe-like) and the so-called nonhanded chirality (potato-like). In the 

case of tetrahedral molecules, enantiomers are handed chiral objects, while octahedral complexes, 

having six different ligands, can be  an example of nonhanded  chiral objects.6  In  general, we deal 

2

with not superimposable mirror images as chiral objects (enantiomers), neither superimposable nor 

mirror images chiral objects (diastereoisomers), and achiral objects (isomers which are completely 

superimposable by rotation). In any case, the chiral nature of objects can be estabilished taking into 

account the group of transformations acting on the configuration space, i.e. the ensemble of all the 

possible configurations of the system itself. In this sense, chirality is a symmetry which emerges in 

abstract space (e.g. the spin-helicity configuration space of elementary particles) and it depends on 

the true structure of the  object, rather than on the physical space where it is embedded. With this 

concept in mind, if a system is constituted by N elements, the group of possible transformations is 

G(N), where G is defined in the abstract space of dimension N.3 A general definition of chirality is 

then related to the number of possible rotations and inversions which a system with N constituents 

can  undergo.  It  is  then  straightforward  to  consider  the  O(N)  groups  which  are  the  groups  of 

rotations and inversions of a given system. The case of tetrahedral molecules is enlightening (Figure

Fig 1. 24 Fischer projections for the enantiomers of a tetrahedral molecule. 

A  tetrahedron,  constituted  by  4  different  ligands,  has  4!=24  possible  configurations  which  are 
nothing else but the Fischer projections of the two enantiomers of the molecule.7 

A tetrahedral molecule can be assigned by a column vector  Ψ ,

related to the possibility that two bonds of the molecule undergo an inversion, which, in the set of 

possible configurations, means a transition from the (+)-enantiomer to the (-)-enantiomer and vice-

versa. From a quantum mechanical viewpoint, this can be a quantum tunneling process so that O(4) 
represents a quantum chiral algebra.3,4 

It is interesting to point out that the isomorphism

holds for groups SU(2) and SO(4) so that rotations and inversions of ligands can be given in terms 

of Pauli matrices or unitary quaternions.4 Features like these indicate that quantum states of chiral 

tetrahedral  molecules  and  fundamental  particles  show  analogies  which  have  to  be  seriously  taken 

into account as previously suggested by Heisenberg.2 

These  arguments  can  be  easily  generalized  to  generic  systems  with  an  even  number  N  of 

constituents  (e.g.  ligands),  with  N!  configurations.  The  algebra  will  be  O(N),  the  number  of

SPIRAL STRUCTURE: TRAILING AND LEADING ARMS 

The  above  discussion  can  be  specified  for  spiral  galaxies  which  have  their  arms  winding  in  a 

trailing  or  in  a  leading  sense  (Figure  2).  Trailing  means  that  the  tips  of  the  arms  point  in  the 

opposite  direction  from  rotation,  while  in  the  case  of  leading  arms  the  tips  point  in  the  same 

5

direction  of  rotation.  These  features  are  not  always  immediately  evident  in  the  galaxy  structure: 

they appear very clearly in the so-called grand-design spirals, which usually have two symmetric 

and well-defined arms as in the case of the galaxy M51. However, not all spirals are grand-design 

with two distinct arms; they can be flocculent and in this case the spiral structure is not simple to be 

recognised.

Fig. 2. Trailing and leading modes of spiral galaxies. 
 
The  distinction  between  trailing  and  leading  spiral  arms  requires  the  determination  of  the 

orientation of the plane of the galaxy relative to our line of sigth (Figure 2), so that radial velocity 

measuraments  can  be  unambiguosly  interpreted  in  terms  of  the  direction  of  galaxy  rotation. 

Considering  the  recession  velocity,  that  is  given  by  the  Hubble  relation  (which  holds  for  every 

 

6

galaxy  thanks  to  the  cosmological  expansion) 

,  where  H0  is  the  Hubble  constant  (today 

=

dHv

0

esteemed  ~71  Km·sec-1·Mpc-1)8  and  d  the  distance  of  the  galaxy  from  the  observer,  a  definite 

chirality is assigned. Moving along the arms of the galaxy toward the center and taking into account 

the direction of recession velocity, the helicity is assigned so that trailing galaxies are left-helical, 

while leading galaxies are right-helical. However, although the trailing and leading arm objects at 

the top of Figure 2 are distinct and non-superimposable with respect to reflection within the plane, 

the sense of rotation has to be taken into account. In fact, the rotation will reverse under reflection 

within the plane. The enantiomers in two dimensions are, in fact, the trailing arms galaxy rotating in 

one sense (top of Figure 2) and the leading arms galaxy rotating in the opposite sense, which also 

makes  it  a  trailing  arms  galaxy!  Due  to  this  problem,  it  is  essential  an  absolute  observational 

determination of the rotation of a galaxy with respect to a given observer (i.e. with respect to us). In 

principle,  rotation  of  a  galaxy  is  a  “kinematic”  quantity  which  cannot  be  reversed,  thanks  to  the 

conservation  of  angular  momentum  and  to  the  fact  that  galaxies,  as  we  said,  participate  to  the 

recession motion of cosmos with respect to us, unless the system undergoes some strong dynamical 

interaction, as it will be discussed below. This fact allows an absolute determination of trailing and 

leading modes. In order to be clear, it is worth entering into some details of observations. 

Considering the two galaxies in Figure 2, in both cases, the (x,y)-plane is the celestial sphere and 

the  z-axis  is  assumed  to  point  toward  the  Sun.  The  galaxy  on  the  left  is  inclined  so  that  the  side 

nearest the Sun is in the half plane y > 0, while the galaxy on the right has its near side in the half 

plane y < 0. In Figure 2, the spiral pattern and the rotation direction are indicated for both galaxies; 

the spiral galaxy on the left is leading and that on the right is trailing. Despite this difference, the 

appearance of both galaxies as seen from the Sun is the same; as shown in Figure 2, in both systems 

the spiral pattern appears to curve in an anti-clock-wise direction as one moves out from the center, 

and the side with x > 0 has radial velocity toward the Sun. Thus, radial velocity measurements and 

photographs of the spiral pattern cannot, by themselves, distinguish leading and trailing spirals. To 

determine whether a particular galaxy leads or trails, it must be determined which side of it is closer 

to us. One way to do this, is to count the numbers of objects such as standard candles as novae and 

globular clusters that are seen on either side of the apparent major axis. If the objects are heavily 

obscured by dust in the central plane, then fewer objects will be seen on the near side of the galaxy 

and  this  fact  constitutes  a  problem.  Apart  from  using  standard  candles,  the  near  side  can  also  be 
determined  by  studying  the  pattern  of  absorption  in  the  dust  lanes.11  Summing  up  all  these 

observational methods, unambiguous answers can be achieved. 

In  almost  all  cases,  where  this  determination  can  be  made,  it  does  appear  that  spiral  arms  are 
trailing,9  while  the  rare  leading  spirals  are  interpreted  as  the  result  of  tidal  encounters  with 

 

7

retrograde-moving  objects  (the  case  of  Andromeda  galaxy  M31  and  its  companion  M32  is  a 

remarkable example). In the next section, environmental effects will be discussed. 

Turning to the orthogonal  group description of chirality, the spiral  arms  can be considered as the 

ligands and the configuration space is 2D. The 2D-image (the galaxy proiected onto its lying plane) 

cannot be superimposed with its mirror image without removing the image from the plane. The two 

images  are  the  leading  and  trailing  structures  sketched  in  Figure  2.  The  two  modalities  are 

parametrized by a rotation angle, then chirality is algebraically described by the O(2) group, where 

the number of generators is 

, corresponding to the rotation angle. To demonstrate these

which takes a plane and maps it into its mirror image. For galaxies, the two enantiomers are mirror 

trailing  and  leading  structures  and,  in  order  to  pass  from  one  to  the  other,  a  discrete  inversion  is 

necessary (Figure 2). In this sense, spiral galaxies are non-superimposable chiral objects.

As it is well known, U(1) group describes the transformations of the electromagnetic field. In the 

present  context,  it  describes  the  symmetry  between  trailing  and  leading  modes  which  transform

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AND EVOLUTION OF SPIRAL GALAXIES TOWARD 

ACHIRAL SYSTEMS 

Summarizing the above discussion, spiral galaxies (at least the grand-design ones) are enantiomers 

which naturally appear in the left-helical series characterized by trailing arms. These structures are 
quasistatic density waves which are stable with respect to the typical age of a galaxy (~1010 yr) and 
take part to the global motion around the bulge  with periods of the order of 108  yr. These results 
constitute the solution, obtained by Lin and Shu,10 of the so-called winding problem which led to 

the paradox that material arms, composed by a fixed set of identifiable stars and gas clouds, would 

necessarily wind up on a short time scale if compared to the age of the galaxy. Considering density 
waves with a global pattern speed,9,11 the spiral structure results stable against small perturbations 

and remains permanent during the evolution unless the galaxy would undergo strong gravitational 

interactions.  This  feature  of  a  spiral  galaxy  can  be  considered  genetic  in  the  sense  that  it  is  the 

original angular momentum of the protogalaxy that gives rise to the spiral structure, which remains 

a permanent feature of the system. Joined to the fact that, observations almost always reveal trailing 
arms,12 it seems that a chiral asymmetry in spiral galaxies exists and only one modality is favoured 

likewise in the case of aminoacids and neutrinos (both left-handed). 

This  statement  deserves  a  wide  discussion,  first  of  all  in  connection  to  the  other  morphological 

types  of  Hubble  sequence  (Figure  3)  and  the  environmetal  effects  which  could  lead  toward  a 

progressive loss of chirality in galaxies.

Let  us  start  our  considerations  pointing  out  a  recent  study  by  Kondepudi  and  Durand,13  who 

performed a fine statistical analysis taking into account the spiral galaxies in the Carnegie Atlas of 

Galaxies.14  They  considered  540  galaxies  classified  as  normal  (S)  or  barred  (SB)  spirals.  An 

interesting dominance of trailing structures emerges for S-type galaxies and a dominance of leading 

structures is revealed for SB-type galaxies. In other words, the presence of the bar is correlated to 

the  leading  modes,  while  grand-design  normal  galaxies  are  trailing.  This  fact  can  be  interpreted 

considering the relative positions of morphological Hubble types in the clusters of galaxies and the 

probability  that  galaxies  suffer  strong  or  tidal  gravitational  interactions  among  them.  A  wide 

number of studies9,15 reports that elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies reside in large clusters, 

typically  containing  from  102  to  103  galaxies,  while  spiral  galaxies  are  found  on  the  boundary  of 

clusters, in loose groups or in open fields. Clusters are often dense environments, bound together by 

the  mutual  gravitational  attraction  of  constituent  galaxies  which  is  going  to  increase  toward  the 

center. Symmetric, well-shaped clusters are always core-dominated by huge elliptical cD galaxies 

(with masses ranging from 1013 to 1014 solar masses) which site in the center of symmetry (Figure 

4).  On  the  other  hand,  spiral  galaxies  reside  in  extremely  less  dense  zones,  where  mutual 

gravitational  interactions  are  very  rare.  In  general,  E  and  S0  galaxies  are  classified  as  cluster 

galaxies, while S galaxies are classified as field galaxies.9 The SB galaxies are in an intermediate 

situation. Bars are the result of gravitational interactions not so strong to destroy the global spiral 

structure.  As  shown  by  numerical  simulations  by  Elmegreen  et  al.16  and  Gerin  et  al.,17  the 

interaction of two galaxies gives rise to tidal tensions capable of twisting the buldge and inducing 

the  formation  of  a  bar.  Unlike  spiral  arms,  bars  are  not  density  waves  since  the  majority  of  their 

stars  always  remains  within  the  bar.  This  means  that,  although  photometric  observations  suggest 

that  bars  and  spiral  arms  seem  joined,  the  former  are  leading  structures  in  counter-rotation  with 

respect to the spiral arms.9 The cumulative effect, as in the case of M31 and M32, would be that a 

leading  spiral  structure  results  and  the  morphological  type  evolves  as  S  ⇒  SB.  Without  entering 

into  details  of  bar  formation,  SB  galaxies  can  be  seen  as  an  intermediate  state  between  chirally-

defined systems (S-galaxies) and system which are loosing, by gravitational interactions, their chiral 

features (E and S0 galaxies) since they are living in much dense environments. Gravitational field 

and  tidal  encounters  act  as  a  sort  of  thermic  or  photo-induced  racemization  for  enantiopure 

compounds.18 In other words, starting from a well-defined chiral modality (trailing S-galaxies), an 

 

11

evolution through a quasi-racemate7 (S and SB-galaxies) and toward completely achiral objects (E, 

S0 galaxies) can be envisaged. 

This process can be viewed as a dynamical loss of chirality. A pictorial scheme of the situation is 

proposed in Figure 4, where the genetic chirality is going to be lost when the systems are evolving 

toward high density zones. 

As concluding remark, it appears that the Hubble morphological sequence is related to the degree of 

chirality of galaxies and, essentially, we can say that late-type galaxies (S) are chiral objects, while 

early-type galaxies (E) are achiral objects. In this perspective, the Hubble diagram can be seen as a 

chirality loss sequence indicating the dynamical evolution of the stellar systems.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK 

Galaxies  can  be  considered  chiral  systems  and  the  chirality  degree  depends  on  environmental 

effects.  Isolated,  weak  gravitationally  interacting  galaxies  are  more  chiral  than  galaxies  in  highly 

dense environments as clusters. The full chiral systems are spiral galaxies which show 2D-chirality, 

algebraically  described  by  the  O(2)  orthogonal  group  of  rotations  and  inversions.  Observational 

data indicate a preferred left-handed chirality for those normal spirals where the rotation of the arms 

can  be  unambiguosly  defined  (trailing  modes)  as  the  isolated  grand-design  spirals.  Barred  spirals 

can be the results of tidal encounters with retrograde-moving objects and they always show a chiral 

characterization (an excess of leading modes). This morphology-density relation indicates that the 

same Hubble sequence can be specified by chirality. In other words, chirality looks like a secondary 

feature able to denote a segregation between early-type and late-type stellar systems. 

However, this preliminary result on a preferred genetic modality of chiral galaxies has to be more 

confidentially  supported  by  deeper  and  refined  analysis  of  large  observational  data  sets  (for 

example 2dF or SDSS surveys),19 as soon as their morphological and dynamical characters will be 

completely defined. In particular, the use of deep and wide astronomical surveys (containing data 

between 100,000 and 1,000,000 of galaxies with rotation curves  coupled with the overall angular 

momentum) can greatly enhance the statistics to support our result. 

At  this  point,  an  important  concluding  remark  is  necessary  on  the  underlying  philosophy  of  our 

approach. Clearly, the physics of chirality in two dimensions (spiral galaxies) is quite different from 

that in three dimensions (tetrahedral molecules) or from that of elementary particles. The unifying 

view  which  we  propose  is  due  to  the  fact  that  all  such  classes  of  objects  can  be  dealt  with 

orthogonal  group  O(N),  where  N  is  the  number  of  contituents,  which  determines  the  number  of 

dimensions in an “abstract” space of configurations. N = 2 is the number of arms for galaxies, or the 

number  of  polarization  states  for  particles  (e.g.  neutrinos),  N  =  4  is  the  number  of  ligands  for  a 

tetrahedron.  These  numbers  are  independent  of  the  “true”  physical  space  where  objects  lives. 

Furthermore, as we discussed above, N! is the number of configurations that the object can assume 

in  such  an  abstract  space  (e.g.  the  number  of  24  Fischer  projections  or  the  2  trailing  and  leading 

modes of galaxies), while 

 is the number of independent parameters which specifies the

2

O(N)  group.  In  the  case  of  tetrahedral  molecules  is  six,  in  the  case  of  galaxies  is  one  (rotation 

 

13

angle). However, it is misleading to state that chirality of particles, molecules and  galaxies is the 

“same” fundamental feature for so widely different systems. Our viewpoint, is that the analogy4 of 

dealing with different objects under the standard of O(N) groups should be seriously considered in 

order to achieve a final and fundamental theory of chirality suitable of working at any scale and for 

any physical space (2D or 3D). A great deal of work in this direction has to be done.

Recently1, Badzey and Mohanty demonstrated the usefulness of suitable amounts of 

noise in controlling switching in bistable nanomechanical silicon oscillators by 

stochastic resonance. Their nanomechanical systems consist of beams that are clamped 

at each end and driven into transverse oscillation with the use of a radiofrequency 

source which is modulated to control switching of the beams between two stable states. 

In their conclusions, they emphasized that: "In sharp contrast to most other systems 

investigated for stochastic resonance, we use a square-wave modulation, as opposed to 

the canonical sine wave. This is an experimental consideration, because we found that 

switching was much more easily achieved with a square wave." However, they do not 

provide any explanation or literature reference for the underlying mechanism2,3 which 

greatly reinforces the noise-induced switching. Indeed, the appearance of responses of 

both symmetric2 and asymmetric3 bistable systems subjected to a square-wave 

modulation with the same shape and period as the modulation (as those found in the two 

cases considered by Badzey and Mohanty) was explained in terms of geometrical 

resonance. This wide-ranging notion was introduced as a nonlinear generalization of the 

2 

usual or frequency resonance4 and applied theoretically to control temporal5 and 

spatiotemporal6 chaos as well as patterns7. To conclude, future nanomechanical memory 

elements could very well be based on the cooperative effect of the geometrical 

resonance and stochastic resonance mechanisms to optimally enhance switching. 

Badzey and Mohanty's system provides for the first time a beautiful demonstration of 

this profitable cooperation.

Abstract:
Spectra from xenon ions have been recorded at the NIST EBIT and the emission into  a
2% bandwidth at 13.5  nm  arising from  4d_5p  transitions  compared  with  that  from
4d_4f and 4p_4d transitions in Xe XI and also with that obtained from the  unresolved
transition  array  (UTA)  observed  to  peak  just  below  11  nm.   It  was  found  that  an
improvement of a factor of five could be gained in photon  yield using the  UTA  rather
than the 4d_5p emission.  The results are compared with atomic structure  calculations
and imply that a significant gain in efficiency should be obtained using  tin,  in  which
the emission at 13.5 nm comes from a similar UTA,  rather  than  xenon as  an  EUVL
source material.

1 BACKGROUND:

The search for the optimum radiation source at  13.5 nm is one of the  main challenges
in  EUV  physics  today.  Currently  the  quest  is  to  find  a  source  with  a  conversion
efficiency  (CE)  of  3%  into  2%  bandwidth  as  defined  by  the  needs  of  the
microelectronic industry [1].  The earliest work  was  performed  with  laser  produced
plasmas generated on solid targets. Kauffman et al. [2] attained a CE close to  1% into
3% bandwidth using 7.5 ns, 300 mJ frequency doubled Nd:YAG pulses  focussed to  a
power  density  of  2×1011  Wcm-2  onto  a  tin  target.  Subsequently  Spitzer  et  al.  [3]
obtained a CE > 0.8% into 3% bandwidth, again using tin irradiated at  power  densities
of 1-2×1011 Wcm-2. In their work they performed an extensive survey  of the  emission
from a large range of elements and found that  the  emission at  the  required wavelength
peaked near tin. At higher  power  densities  they  noted  that  the  intensity  decreased.
Shevelko et al. [4] also undertook an extensive study  of the  spectra  of a large number
of  elements  from  laser  produced  plasmas  with  a  KrF  excimer laser  focussed  to  a
power  density  of  1012 Wcm-2  onto  planar  targets  including  tin  and  found  that  the
maximum  intensity  was  in  fact  obtained  for  Ge  and  Re  under  these  conditions.  So
early work already pointed to the sensitivity of the emission of specific elements  to
laser power density.

In  order  to  avoid  the  debris  problems  associated  with  solid  targets  other  target
materials were sought with strong emission in the 13-14 nm region. Jin and Richardson
[5] used mass limited water ice targets, where the emission is from the  O  VI lines near

1

13 nm, to limit the  debris. However, all of their early work  with  mass-limited targets
produced significant levels of debris  both  in  the  form  of  ions  and  particulates  of
various sizes.    The  need  to  reduce particulate  emission led  to  the  choice of  xenon.
There is a line group between 13-14 nm in the spectrum  of Xe which has been shown
by a number of researchers to arise from 4d8 _  4d75p  transitions  in Xe XI  [6].  These
lines have recently been identified by Churilov et al. [7] by comparison of new very
high  resolution  data  with  atomic  structure  calculations  using  the  suite  of  codes
developed by Cowan  [8]. Considerable  work  has  been  expended  on  exploring the
feasibility of using laser produced plasmas of xenon clusters produced by  supersonic
jets  or  gas  puffs  from  nozzles  or  solid  xenon  targets  [9].   The  highest  conversion
efficiencies  (1.2%  into  2%  bandwidth)  have  been  achieved  using  solid  xenon  by
Shields et al. [10].  Liquid jet targets were also developed and conversion efficiencies
of the order of 0.75% have been reported  with  these  [11]. In addition, a wide variety
of pulsed discharge sources using xenon  or  xenon/helium mixtures are  being actively
investigated. A conversion efficiency of 0.8% into a 2π solid angle has recently been
reported [12].

As already stated  the  relevant emission from  xenon originates from  a  single ion
stage, Xe10+,  for  which  a  theoretical  spectrum,  calculated  with  the  Cowan  suite  of
codes is shown in Fig. 1.  From this diagram it is obvious that  the  4p64d8   _    (4p 54d9 +
4d74f)  line  group  near  11  nm  is  significantly  stronger  than  the  4d  _ 5p  transitions
occurring near 13.5 nm. In  addition,  plasma  modelling predicts  that  the  maximum
concentration of Xe10+ attainable is only of the order of 50%.   So any advantages  of
using xenon, based on its gaseous nature and inherent cleanliness, must  be weighed up
against the disadvantages of a  low  density  of  emitting  ions  and  the  fact  that  the
transitions involved are at least a factor of ten weaker than those occurring in the 11
nm band. Moreover the 13.5 nm wavelength of choice almost coincides  with  that  of
maximum absorption in the neutral and low ion stages [13].

If instead of xenon, one considers tin,  the  emission arising from 4p64dn_(4p 54dn+1
+  4dn-14f)  transitions  in  a  range  of  adjacent  ion  stages  overlap  to  produce  an
unresolved  transition  array  (UTA)  centred  near  13.5  nm    [14].  Final  state
configuration interaction between the  4p 54dn+1  and  4dn-14f  configurations  causes  a
narrowing of the array and also causes the  most  intense lines to  essentially overlap in
energy [15-17].   The profile of  the  UTA  in  this  type  of  transition  is  known  to  be
sensitive to concentration of the element of interest because  of  opacity  effects  [18].
O’Sullivan  and  Faulkner  [14]  showed  that  if  the  tin  concentration  was  reduced  to
approximately 10%, the peak  brightness  actually  increased.   This  result  also  agrees
with the data of Choi et al. [19] who,  in a space  resolved study  of emission from tin
metal and tin oxide targets, found that the in band emission  from  a  SnO2  film target
was  greater  than  that  from  a  tin  slab  target.  For  mass  limited  targets,  the  peak
intensity  essentially  is  unaltered  but  the  profile  width  decreases  as  the  tin
concentration is reduced [20].  Thus  optical  opacity  effects  are  extremely important
and radiation transport effects must be included in any attempt  to  model the  plasmas.
Furthermore, if the remaining 90% of the target constituents are low Z  materials the
radiation emitted is concentrated in a band 1-2-nm wide centred near 13.7 nm and the
ordinary recombination continuum from the plasma is suppressed  in comparison with
that  from  a  pure  tin  target.   In  fact  if  pure  tin  targets  are  used  the  recombination

2

continuum contains most of the emitted radiation. It extends throughout the  XUV and
if absorbed by  the  multilayer optics  could cause heating, possible  distortion  and loss
of focus.  These results indicate that a composite target, including approximately  10%
tin, would be an appropriate candidate for a 13.5 nm source.

The large in band intensity emitted from tin plasmas  has  encouraged their  study
and CE values  of  2%  or  greater have  been  reported  [11,21,22].    The  maximum CE
attainable is expected to exceed the 3% target set by  industry.    However  theoretical
determination of the maximum CE attainable is  hampered  by  a  lack of  experimental
data.  For example no identification exists for any of the  strong lines within  the  UTA.
Indeed, the wavelength ranges at which different ions emit  most  strongly  within  the
overall UTA envelope are not known either.

Under certain conditions,  UTA  involving δn  =  0  transitions  are  the  strongest
features observed in EUV spectra from laser produced plasmas [23].   To understand
why, one needs to look at  the  redistribution  of  oscillator strength  from  the  4d  _  εf
resonance in the neutral spectrum to 4d _ 4f transitions  in the  ions.  In neutral tin  the
effective  interaction  between  the  nucleus  and  an  l=3  electron  contains  attractive
coulomb and repulsive centrifugal terms that  result  in  a  bimodal potential  with  two
pronounced minima.  The first minimum, with  is  centre  near  the  Bohr  radius,  a0,  is
close to the 4d wavefunction peak but lacks sufficient depth  to  support  a bound level
and, as a result, the 4d → f photoexcitation channel is dominated by  a 4d → εf shape
resonance that forms when the outgoing f electron has sufficient energy to  overcome
the centrifugal barrier.   The  outer  shallow  well,  centred  near  16  a0,  is  essentially
hydrogenic in character and contains the 4f level.   Because  there  is  essentially  no
overlap with the 4d wavefunction, 4d→4f  lines are absent [24].

However,  with  increasing  ionisation  the  centrifugal  barrier  disappears  and  4f
wavefunction contraction into the inner well region results  in  a  transfer  of  oscillator
strength  from  the  continuum  to  the  discrete  spectrum.   The  inner  potential  well
becomes deeper and narrower and the 4f  wavefunction  gradually  contracts  into  the
core  region  where  it  has  a  large  spatial  overlap  with  the  4 d   wavefunction.
Consequently, 4d  _  4f  transitions  become intense  and  essentially  contain  all of  the
oscillator  strength  associated  with  the  neutral  shape  resonance.  These  neutral
resonances, where they occur, completely dominate the EUV photoabsorption spectra
so the transitions that evolve from them, the  δn  =  0  UTA,  likewise dominate EUV
emission  spectra.   This  evolution  has  been  studied  experimentally  for  a  number  of
isonuclear sequences [25,26] and in each case the transfer of oscillator  strength  from
continuum to discrete features is clearly seen.

This paper seeks to address the latter point by using Xe spectra  acquired at  the
NIST EBIT,  which produces  an optically  thin  plasma and allows some degree of ion
stage  differentiation,  to  gain  information  on  the  contribution  of  the  emission  of
individual ion stages to  the  UTA  at  11  nm  and  enable comparison  of  the  emission
intensity  to  that  at  13.5  nm.    These  can  then  be  used  to  calibrate atomic  structure
calculations which, when  extended to  tin,  should  provide  useful  information on  the
spectral contribution of different ion stages to the UTA and  shed  some  light on  the
maximum CE attainable.

Experiment:

Spectra were obtained at the NIST EBIT (Electron Beam Ion Trap) [27] using a xenon
injection pressure between 5 × 10-5 torr and 9 × 10-5 torr and a range of accelerator and
trap  voltages.   EBITs  were  developed  to  perform  spectroscopic  studies  of  highly
charged  ions,  which  are  created  by  sequential  electron  impact  ionisation.  Once
positively charged ions are formed they are confined to the trap region by a mixture of
magnetic and electrostatic fields. Radiation emitted from the  plasma within  the  trap  is
viewed through side windows at 90 degrees to the electron beam. The experiments
involved  varying  EBIT  operating  parameters,  such  as  the  beam  energy  (which
determines the highest charge state that can be created), so  that  the  distribution  of ion
stages within the plasma changed systematically. The spectra were recorded on a 0.25
m flat field grating vacuum spectrograph equipped with a variable line space  grating of
the sort described by Kita et al. [28] and fitted with a CCD [29].  Individual spectra
were integrated typically over  five  minute  intervals.    The  spectral  resolution  varied
from 0.02 at 5 nm to 0.035 at 19 nm and the spectra were  corrected for  cosmic ray
events.

For comparison, spectra of laser produced plasmas formed on solid xenon slab
targets  were  recorded  with  a  2.2  m  Schwob-Fraenkel  spectrograph  with  mean
resolution of 0.001 in the  11 to  14 nm region.  A  Nd:YAG laser operating at  λ=1.06
µm and capable of delivering up to 1 J in a 20 ns  pulse  was  used to  generate the  EUV
emitting plasmas. The output was  focused typically  to  a spot  size  of diameter ~ 100
µm. The maximum average power density attained was 1 × 1012 W cm-2. According to
the collisional radiative equilibrium (CR) model of Colombant  and  Tonon  [30]  the
corresponding electron temperature was close to 200 eV.  

Theoretical:
Using  the  Cowan  suite  of  codes,  it  is  possible  to  calculate  theoretical  spectra  (gA
values versus λ) for a range of ion stages in xenon.  The results are shown  in Fig. 2 for
ion stages IX (ground configuration  4d10)  through  XVIII  (ground configuration 4d1),
i.e. those stages containing 4d electrons in their valence or outermost  subshell,  for
xenon.  In each of these spectra the bulk of the  resonance emission arises from 4p64dn
_ (4p 54dn+1 + 4dn-14f) lines which merge to form a UTA  lying in the  10–12 nm region
in xenon. This UTA occurs  in  the  13-14  nm  region in  tin.  Final  state  configuration
interaction between the 4p 54dn+1 and 4dn-14f configurations causes these  transitions  to
overlap in energy [15].

In an optically thin plasma, these lines should completely dominate the EUV
emission.  At  the  ion  densities  encountered  in  laser  produced  plasmas  and  also  in
discharge plasmas, opacity effects become important and have the effect  of  reducing
the intensity of the UTA by comparison with that of the 4d _ 5p transition  groups
lying at longer wavelengths.  For example, one such group in Xe X at 15 nm, identified
by  Kaufman and Sugar  [31] and  Churilov  and  Joshi  [32],  was  recently  found  by
Böwering et al. [33] to be particularly intense under a  particular  set  of  experimental
conditions in a discharge plasma. No allowance for opacity effects has been  made in
the spectra shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Recently calculations have been preformed using
the HULLAC code [34]  to  allow  for  radiation transport  effects  in  xenon [35].  The
results show the  correct  intensity  trends  but  because the  line positions  are  derived
from ab initio calculations the peaks are  greatly  displaced  from  their  true  positions.

4

Moreover,  because  of  the  high  densities  encountered  in  laser  produced  plasmas
emission from satellite lines must also be included in any complete model. The  impact
of such lines on the xenon emission  spectrum  has  recently  been  reported  by  Sasaki
[36].

 In contrast in the  case of EBIT  spectra,  opacity  effects are negligible and the
spectra might be expected to mirror the calculated oscillator strength differences better
than  emission  spectra  from  laser  produced  plasmas.   At  the  electron  densities
appropriate to the EBIT spectra presented here, (1013-1014 cm-3), collisional excitation
rates  must  be  taken  into  account  [37]  These  considerations  lead  to  considerable
differences in the calculated spectra especially  for  very  highly  charged ions.  This  is
clearly evident from the  spectra  shown  in  Fig. 3  which  can  be  compared  with  that
from a laser produced plasma (Fig. 4), where absorption features in  Xe  VI,  VII,  IX,
[38] are clearly evident.

Results
From Fig. 1, it is seen that the summed gA value available  in  4d  _  5p  transitions  is
significantly less than that attainable in the UTA,  corresponding to  4p64d8   _   (4p 54d9
+ 4d74f). In order to compare the relative intensities of the δn = 0 transitions at  11 nm
with those at 13.5 nm in Xe XI, it is  useful  to  compare  the  summed  gA  values  for
transitions  falling  within  a  2%  bandwidth  at  13.5  nm  and  a  similar  width  window
(0.27 nm) centred at 11.17 nm, which corresponds to  the  emission peak  of the  Xe XI
UTA [39].  In Fig. 5 an EBIT emission spectrum obtained at a beam energy of 210 eV
(the ionisation potential required to get 11 times ionised xenon is 226 eV) is compared
with  the  high  resolution  experimental  data  of  Churilov  et al. [39],  which  has  been
convolved  with  an  instrument  profile  with  a  full  width  half  maximum of  0.02  nm
(assumed to be gaussian for simplicity) pertinent to the  detection  system  employed
on the EBIT.   Once the two spectra have been scaled to the  same  peak  intensity  at
11.17 nm, the agreement between the  two  spectra  is good, suggesting that  Xe XI,  the
most highly charged ion stage obtainable, is the  strongest  emitter  in  this  wavelength
region present in the EBIT under these experimental conditions. The number of counts
within  the  bandwidths  of  interest  were  37.3/s  at  11.17  nm  and  11.9/s  at  13.5  nm,
giving a ratio of 3 (see Table 1). In taking this  ratio  a  constant  background obtained
from the tails of the spectrum  was  assumed at  each location.  This  experimental ratio
can be compared with a value of 1.4 obtained from the vacuum spark  data of Churilov
et al. [39], assuming a resolving power of fwhm = 0.02nm. In  the  case  of  the  EBIT
data, the system response was essentially flat across  the  wavelength range of interest,
while the response of the system used by Churilov et al. [39] has not  been quantified.
If one assumes that the response of this system does not vary greatly  from 11 to  13.5
nm, then  it  seems  likely  that  opacity  effects  could  be  responsible  for  the  different
values.  The  corresponding  ratio  obtained  from  calculations  was  20.  The  ratio  is
particularly sensitive to the scaling factors applied to the Slater-Condon parameters in
the calculations.  Using scaling parameters of 90% for Fk and Gk the  ratio was  4 while
using 80% (4d_4f) and 85% (4d_5p), the values that best fit the data of Churilov et al.
[39], gave the value quoted above. The difference arises from the  fact that  a change of
scaling of only 1% causes a shift in wavelength of 0.1 nm, which is sufficient to  move
the strongest lines in or out of the window chosen for the  summation.  This  is further

5

borne out by the fact that if both calculated summations are performed  over  a  7.5%
bandwidth,  centred  at  13.5  nm  and  11.17  nm  respectively,  the  ratio  is  15  in  both
cases.  The difference between the theoretical and experimental values is most likely to
be due to the assumption that the line emission is determined by the gA values and no
consideration has been made for variations among the population of the emitting levels
or collisional effects.   The sensitivity of the calculations to the  scaling factors  might
also  contribute  to  the  discrepancy  between  the  measurements  and  calculations.
Nonetheless the experimental results obtained here confirm that a source  based  on
emission associated with δn = 0 transitions will lead to higher CE values.

A spectrum recorded at  an EBIT  beam energy of 1000 eV is shown  in Fig. 6.
The  enhancement  of  the  shorter  wavelength  features  in  comparison  to  the  sharp
feature at 12 nm is evident from the figure. This sharp feature results from  emission
from Xe IX [32]. The lower wavelength side of the δn = 0 UTA is also enhanced in
the 1000 eV spectrum in comparison with that recorded at a beam energy of 500 eV
(Fig . 3). There are also features in the 13.5 nm band that are not evident in the  500 eV
spectrum.  These  observations  are  consistent  with  the  production  of  higher  charge
states as the energy of the electron beam is increased.

In  the  EBIT  spectra,  the  observed  UTA  peaks  at  an  energy  of  10.84  nm,
which is slightly higher than  the  observed emission peak  of Xe XI  at  11.17 nm [39].
The count rates  within  a 0.27 nm band centred here are compared with  the  counts  at
13.5 and 11.17 nm in table 1.  In Fig. 7 we plot the two in band ratios  as a function of
EBIT beam energy. This plot clearly shows the effect of additional ion stages at  lower
wavelength. The maximum ratio of the emission from the 10.84 nm band to the 13.5
nm band is 5.2, obtained at  an EBIT  energy of 500 eV. The  large increase with  beam
energy  for  the  band  centred  at  10.84  nm  is  consistent  with  the  increase  being
associated  with  emission  from  higher  charge  states  at  lower  wavelengths.  The
calculations shown in Fig. 2 indicate that  charge states  from Xe10+  to  Xe17+ exhibit δn
= 0 UTAs between 10 and 11 nm, although there are relatively few lines in the  Xe17+
feature.  The relatively constant ratio associated with the 11.17 nm band is due to  the
fact that the emission in both of the relevant areas of the spectrum is dominated by Xe
XI transitions. At higher EBIT beam energies both ratios decrease due to contributions
to  the  13.5  nm  region  of  the  spectrum  from  ion  stages  that  start  to  appear  in  the
plasma.

The comparison between our model and the EBIT experimental data suggests
that similar calculations coupled with measurements in tin could be used  to  estimate
the  amount  of  emission  that  will  occur  at  13.5  nm  from  the  analogous  UTA.   Ion
stages from Sn8+ through Sn12+ will contribute to the δn = 0 UTA. If one considers the
spectrum of Sn VII, which is isoelectronic with Xe XI,  and takes  the  ratio of 4d _ 5p
to 4l _ 4l emission again within a 0.27 nm window centred on  the  peak  emission of
each, a ratio of 9 is obtained. This compares with a ratio of 20 in xenon, this  reduction
is to be expected as the 4d 4f overlap in Sn VII is significantly less than  that  in Xe XI
due to the charge dependent nature of the 4f contraction [14,38].
If  one  assumes  that  the  same  mechanisms  responsible  for  the  disparity  between
theory and  experiment in  xenon are  operative  in  the  case  of  tin,  then  the  observed
ratio, which is 5.2 in xenon, would be reduced to  2.3 in tin.  Combining the  measured
ratio of 5.2 with a recently recorded CE at 13.5 nm in xenon  [10],  suggests that  the

6

maximum in band CE that may be derived from a xenon plasma source could be close
to 6% at a wavelength of 10.84 nm. However, plasma opacity effects may  influence
this figure.

Conclusion:
We have shown  that  the  emission intensity  available from the  UTA  appearing in the
spectrum of ionised xenon at 11 nm in a low electron density  regime is  significantly
greater  than  that  obtained  at  13.5  nm,  the  wavelength  of  choice  for  EUVL.    In  a
comparison between atomic structure calculations and experiment we have found that
the calculations overestimate the ratio by a factor close to seven.   Even  allowing for
this  disparity, we  estimate that the  intensity  enhancement obtained  from  moving to
tin as the source material of choice would lead to an enhancement of more than a factor
of two compared to xenon.   We intend to investigate the emission from tin  in the  near
future in order to identify the contributions of different ion stages and their range  of
influence on the UTA occurring in tin plasmas near 13.5 nm.

Fig 1: Theoretical oscillator strength (gA-value) spectrum for Xe10+.

Fig. 2: Theoretical plots of oscillator strength (gA-value) versus wavelength for
xenon. All ion stages with valence 4d electrons are shown. The plots illustrate the
relative weakness of the longer wavelength 4d_5p transitions, which are responsible
for the emission at 13.5 nm in Xe XI.

Fig. 3: EBIT spectrum of xenon obtained at a beam energy of 500 eV and a beam
current of 1.2mA. The spectrum was accumulated over 60 minutes and the xenon
injection pressure was 5x10-5 torr. Vertical lines indicate the 0.27nm bandwidths
referred to in the text.

Fig. 4: Laser produced plasma spectrum from a solid xenon target. Note that the UTA
is significantly broader than in the EBIT spectrum and there is strong underlying
recombination continuum emission.  Opacity effects are clearly evident in the
spectrum and major absorption features arising from lower ion stages are indicated on
the plot.  Note also that because of opacity the peak intensities at 11 nm and 13.5 nm
are closer than in the optically thin EBIT spectrum. The spectrum is comprised of data
obtained at different detector positions, indicated by the different line styles.

Fig. 5. EBIT spectrum of xenon obtained at a beam energy of 210 eV  and  a  beam
current of 0.4 mA. The spectrum was accumulated over 120 minutes and the xenon
injection pressure was 9x10-5 torr. Under these conditions Xe XI is the dominant ion
stage  in  the  EBIT  plasma.  The  dashed  line  is  a  synthetic  spectrum  that  has  been
created by convolving the high resolution Xe XI data of Churilov et al 2004 with an
appropriate instrument function. The synthetic spectrum has been scaled to match the
experimental spectrum intensity at 11.17 nm.

Fig. 7: In band ratios as a function of EBIT beam energy. The ratios are obtained by
dividing the number of counts in a 0.27 nm band centred at 11.17 (squares) and 10.84
(circles) by the counts in a similar band centred at 13.51nm.

Table 1: In band counts and ratios as a function of EBIT energy. The values for the
total  counts  were  obtained  by  summing  all  of  the  counts  that  occurred  within  a
0.27nm bandwidth centred at the indicated energy, after a constant background had
been removed from each spectrum.

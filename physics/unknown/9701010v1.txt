On The Even CAR Algebra

Abstract. We exhibit a family of *-isomorphisms mapping the CAR algebra onto
its even subalgebra.

In 1970 E. Størmer proved that the even subalgebra of the CAR
algebra over an inﬁnite dimensional separable Hilbert space is UHF
of type 2∞, hence *-isomorphic to the CAR algebra itself [1]. But it
seems to be unknown that such isomorphisms have a nice and sim-
ple realization in terms of Bogoliubov endomorphisms with “statistical
dimension” √2.

Bogoliubov endomorphisms are conveniently described using Araki’s
be an inﬁnite dimensional
“selfdual” CAR algebra formalism [2]. Let
separable complex Hilbert space, equipped with a complex conjugation

by 1 and the elements of

Remarks. 1. V and kV as above always exist since dim

since ker V ∗ is invariant under complex conjugation. kV is determined
by V up to a sign. The group of Bogoliubov automorphisms

3. In [3] we constructed left inverses ΦV for Bogoliubov endomor-
phisms ̺V . We get a left inverse ϕV for σV by setting ϕV (a) :=
ΦV (u∗V auV ). Each a

4. Since the representation theory of the CAR algebra is well devel-
oped, one may use the isomorphisms from the Proposition to study
representations of the even CAR algebra. For example, in the algebraic
approach to the chiral Ising model [4], one has to study representations
of the form π
) and ̺W a
̺W with π a Fock representation of
Bogoliubov endomorphism. It was observed [5, 6], but regarded as a
curiosity, that the restriction of π

sentation π

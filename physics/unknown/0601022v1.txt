Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the Johnson (like) noise based classical key-distribution scheme presented by 
Kish [1]. We suggest two passive attack strategies that enable an adversary to gain complete knowledge of the exchanged key. 
The first approach exploits the transient response of the voltage difference on the transmission line after the resistors are switched 
and the second one exploits the finite impedance of the wire connecting the two parties.

(QKDS) 
represent  a  different  approach  enabling,  in  principle, 
unconditionally  secure  key-distribution  based  on  the 
laws  of  quantum  mechanics.  Although  completely 
secure,  QKDS  pose  major  technological  challenges 
which  limit  significantly  the  key-establishing  rates 
(<100kHz) and the achievable ranges (<120km). 

Quantum 

systems 

Recently, a classical KDS scheme utilizing Johnson 
noise  in  resistors  was  suggested  by  Kish  [1].  A 
schematic  of  the  concept  is  shown  in  Fig.  1.  Roughly 
speaking,  the  security  of  the  system  is  based  on  the 
inability  of  an  adversary  (Eve)  to  distinguish  between 
two  symmetrical  cases  (RA=R0,  RB=R1  and  RA=R1, 
RB=R0) using only passive measurements. 

We start by noting that the analysis given in [1] for 
the voltage and current noise density spectra, contains a 
basic flaw. It completely ignores the finite propagation 
time between the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) 
and  the  finite  resistance  of  the  wire  connecting  them. 
When  the  analysis  is  carried  out  taking  into  account 
the,  inevitable, time delay and the resulting transients, 
or  the  impedance  of  the  wire,  we  find  that  the  system 
becomes vulnerable to eavesdropping, thus invalidating 
the  basic  premise  of  [1].  The  comprehensive  analysis 
follows.

Referring  to  Fig.  1,  we  assume  that  the  wave 
impedance  and  length  of  the  transmission  line  (TL) 
connecting Alice and Bob are given by Z0 and length L 
respectively.  For 
the 
transmission  line  is  dispersion-less.  The  voltage  and 
current  along  the  transmission  line  are  given  by  a 
superposition  of  forward  and  backward  propagating 
waves [2]:

When  one  of  the  parties  (say,  Alice)  switches  the 
resistor (and source) on her side, the abrupt change in 
the boundary conditions (BC) generates a voltage (and 
current)  wave  which  propagates  toward  Bob.  If  Eve 
measures the noise density spectrum at an asymmetric 
point  on  the  TL  (e.g.,  close  to  Alice’s  end),  she  can 
detect this voltage wave and infer Alice’s bit.  

For simplicity, we pick a specific scenario in which 
for t<0, both Alice and Bob have R0 terminate their end 
of the TL. At t=0 Alice switches R1 on (see Fig. 2). The 
analysis of the other possibilities is essentially identical 
leading qualitatively to similar conclusions. We divide 
the  analysis  into  two  cases:  1)  The  signal  propagation 
time along the line is much longer than the correlation 
time of the noise generators (or the Johnson noise), i.e., 

the  system  is  a  distributed  system.  2)  The  signal 
propagation  time  along  the  line  is  much  shorter  than 
the  correlation  time  of  the  noise  generators,  i.e.,  the 
system  is  a  lumped  system.  The  analysis  described  by 
Kish [1] is restricted to the second case and, as shown 
in  the  following  analysis,  this  restriction  is  crucial 
because  it  practically  eliminates  the  possibility  to 
utilize  wide  bandwidth  noise  source  such  as  the 
Johnson noise.

that 
<VA(t)VA(t’)>=δtt’V⋅RA  where  V  is  the  scaling  factor 
connecting  the  impedance  of  the  resistor  and  the 
variance  of 
the  corresponding  noise  source  (for 
Johnson  noise  V  given  by  4KT).  Because  the  sources 
VA  and  VB  are  independent,  the  overall  noise  density 
spectrum  measured  by  Eve  is  the  sum  of  the  separate 
contribution of each of them. Using (2) and (3) we find 
that  the  voltage  noise  density  spectrum  measured  at 
l=0  (i.e.  close  to  Alice’s  end)  for  t<0  due  to  Alice’s 
source is given by:

where  in  order  to  sum  the  infinite  series  we  used  the 
assumption  that  the  signal  correlation  time  is  very 
short. It should be noted that the end points of the TL 
(i.e. l=0, l=L), are unique because some of the terms of 
V+ and V- add coherently. At an arbitrary point l’ along

where  τ’  is  the  signal  propagation  time  from  l=0  to

RA  and  RB  are  interchanged.  Note,  that  for  the 
symmetric  case  RA=RB,  the  overall  noise  density 
spectrum  measured  at  l’  is  given  by  Z0V/2,  i.e., 
completely  independent  of  the  resistors  value.  This 
outcome  demonstrates  explicitly  the  importance  of 
propagation  effects  along  the  TL.  In  contrast  with 
Kish’s result (eq. (4) in [1]), in the symmetric case the 
adversary  cannot  gain  knowledge  of  the  bit  values 
selected by Alice and Bob. 

At a first glance, the last conclusion seems to allow 
Alice and Bob to increase their key-establishing rate by 
a factor of two because secure communication can take 
place  even  in  the  symmetric  case.  However,  when 
Alice  and/or  Bob  switch  their  resistors  (and  sources), 
the  change  creates  electromagnetic  waves  that  travel 
towards Alice and Bob and can be detected by Eve and 
used to determine the exchanged bit. 

Returning to the specific example, at t<0, the noise 
density spectrum measured by Eve at some point along 
the line is:

When  Alice  switches  R1  on,  the  abrupt  change  in  the 
BC  generates  a  voltage  (and  current)  wave  which 
propagates  toward  Bob  at  a  velocity  of  Vp=L/τ.  This 
wave  consists  of  two  contributions:  1)  The  new  noise 
source,  associated  with  R1,  connected  by  Alice  and  2) 
A  change  in  the  reflection  coefficient  of  the  left 
propagating wave (V-) at Alice’s end. Since the signals 
generated  by  Alice  and  Bob’s  noise  sources  are  not 
correlated,  we  can  calculate  the  contribution  of  each 
source  separately  and  sum  them  to  obtain  the  power 
density  spectra.  The  voltage  measured  by  Eve  at  l=l’ 
and t>τ’ due to Alice’s source is, therefore:

is the most dominant one), showing that Eve can learn 
of  the  exchanged  bit  by  detecting  the  change  of  the 
voltage generated by these waves. From (8), the noise

reaches  l=l’.  The  contribution  of  Bob’s  source  to  the

Comparing (11) to (7) we find that at t=τ’ (τ’ after 
Alice switched R1 on), the overall voltage noise density 
spectrum measured by Eve changes by a quantity equal 
to  the  second  term  in  the  RHS  of  (11).  In  addition, 
because the contributions of R0 and R1 to that term are 
not  symmetric,  Eve  can  determine  whether  Alice 
switched her resistor from R0 to R1 or vice versa. Thus, 
by  monitoring  the  temporal  evolution  of  the  noise 
density at two points along the TL (one closer to Alice 
and the other closer to Bob), Eve can determine which 
resistors (and sources) were selected by Alice and Bob 
and gain complete knowledge of the exchanged bit.

In  this  section  we  assume,  as  in  [1],  that  the 
bandwidth  of  the  noise  sources  is  narrow,  i.e.,  the 
voltage  of  the  sources  does  not  vary  much  during  the 
propagation time τ. Under this assumption, the steady-
state  analysis  in  [1]  is  accurate  because  the  system  is 
practically  lumped.  However,  when  Alice  and/or  Bob 
switch  their  resistors,  the  assumption  of  the  narrow 
bandwidth  sources  (and  hence,  the  lumped  circuit 
approximation)  becomes  invalid.  Assuming  the  two 
sources  are  uncorrelated,  i.e., 
  and

generates  a  voltage  discontinuity  which  propagates  in 
speed c towards the other side. Thus, similar to case 1, 
by monitoring the temporal evolution of the voltage at 
two  points  along  the  TL  (one  closer  to  Alice  and  the 
other closer to Bob), Eve can determine whether Alice 
and/or  Bob  switched  their  resistors  (and  sources)  and 
gain  complete  knowledge  of  the  exchanged  bit.  Note, 
that  unlike  case  1,  Eve’s  measurement  cannot  reveal 
whether  the  switch  was  from  R0  to  R1  or  vice  versa. 
Nevertheless,  once  an  identical  resistors  scenario 
(RA=RB)  occurs,  Eve  can  determine  the  value  of  the 
resistors  and  use  this  information  to  evaluate  the 
previous and subsequent key bits. 

Finally, we show that Eve can also exploit the finite 
resistance  of  the  wire  connecting  Alice  and  Bob  and 
determine the value of RA and RB (and consequently the 
exchanged  bit)  even  without  resorting  to  temporal 
analysis.  

Referring  to  Fig.  3,  we  assume  that  Eve  measures 
the voltage and current at an asymmetrical point along 
the wire, i.e., RW1≠RW2. The corresponding voltage and 
current  noise  density  spectra  of  Eve  measurement  are 
given by:

The  current  noise  density  spectrum  can  be  used  to 
determine  the  sum  of  RA  and  RB  which  indicates 
whether they are identical or not. For the relevant case, 
i.e.  RA≠RB,  Eve  can  use  the  voltage  noise  density 
spectrum  to  distinguish  between  the  two  possibilities 
(RA=R0,  RB=R1  or  vice  versa)  and  determine  the 
exchanged bit.  

FIG. 3. Determining the exchanged bit using the 
resistance of the transmission line. 

 

As  a  concrete  example,  let  us  consider  a  key 
distribution  system  employing  a  100km  long  copper 
wire  having  a  1mm  diameter.  The  corresponding 
impedance of this wire is ~2kΩ. This resistance is non-
negligible and, depending of Eve’s ability to accurately 
measure the density spectra, it allows her to determine 
Alice and Bob’s selection of resistors. 

To  conclude,  we  study  the  security  level  provided 
by the key-distribution scheme suggested by Kish [1]. 
While  at  steady  state  it  is  impossible  to  determine  the 
resistors configuration, we show that an adversary can 
gain  complete  knowledge  of  the  exchanged  bits  by 
using  passive  attack  strategies  that  exploit  the  finite 
impedance  of  the  wire  connecting  Alice  and  Bob,  or 
the  transient  response  of  the  system  after  the  resistors 
have been switched at the end of one (or more) of the 
parties. The vulnerability of Kish’s scheme to the later 
is crucial because the transient response of the system 
cannot  be  eliminated,  thus  preventing  Alice  and  Bob 
from obtaining any level of secure key distribution.  

and 

thus 

allowing 

detectors, 

Although  the  specific  scheme  suggested  by  Kish 
turns  out,  eventually,  to  be  vulnerable  to  passive 
attacks,  the  underlying  idea  is  interesting  and  worth 
pursuing. While classical key-distribution systems may 
not be able to provide unconditional security, they may 
provide  technological  or  practical  security.  Unlike 
QKDS,  classical  systems  do  not  require  single  photon 
sources 
secure 
communication  to  take  place  over  longer  ranger  with 
faster  key-establishing  rates  using  currently  available 
components and technologies. Such systems may prove 
to be both an efficient intermediate solution for secure 
key-distributions  as  well  as  a  complementary 
technology  to  quantum  key-distribution, especially for 
long haul links.

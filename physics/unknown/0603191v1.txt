Abstract
The novel physics methodology of subquantum kinetics predicted in 1980 that photons
should blueshift their frequency at a rate that varies directly with negative gravitational
potential, the rate of blueshifting for photons traveling between Earth and Jupiter having
been estimated to average approximately 1.3 ± 0.65 X 10-18 s-1, or 1.1 ± 0.6 X 10-18 s-1 for
signals traveling a roundtrip distance of 65 AU through the outer solar system.  A proposal
was made in 1980 to test this blueshifting effect by transponding a maser signal over a 10
AU round-trip distance between two spacecraft.  This blueshift prediction has more recently
been  corroborated  by  observations  of  maser  signals  transponded  to  the  Pioneer  10
spacecraft.  These measurements indicate a frequency shifting of approximately 2.28 ± 0.4
X 10-18 s-1 which lies within 2σ of the subquantum kinetics prediction and which cannot be
accounted for in terms of known forces acting on the craft.  This blueshifting phenomenon
implies the existence of a new source of energy which is able to account for the luminosities
of red dwarf and brown dwarf stars and planets, and their observed sharing of a common
mass-luminosity relation.

1. INTRODUCTION

During the past 30 years, 2.1 GHz maser signals have been transmitted to the Pioneer 10 and

Pioneer 11 spacecraft and coherently transponded back to Earth, the frequency shift of the received

signal being used to determine the recessional velocity of the spacecraft for purposes of navigation.
However, Anderson et al.(1, 2) report that when the computed velocity is compared to the velocity
predicted by orbital models, a discrepancy is found, even after adjustments are made for all known

forces that might act on the spacecraft.  They find a frequency blueshift residual that increases

linearly with time, or in direct proportion to the increase in the line-of-sight distance to the

spacecraft.

If interpreted as a Doppler effect, this residual implies the presence of an anomalous force
accelerating the craft toward the Sun which Anderson et al. calculate to be 8.7 ± 1.3 X 10-8 cm/s2.
Although, as is discussed below, when the propulsive effects of on-board thermal radiation sources
are taken into account, this decreases to a residual acceleration of 6.85 ± 1.3 X 10-8 cm/s2.  If
interpreted as an anomalous acceleration, the effect is perplexing since most plausible forces, such

as gravity, decrease rapidly with distance whereas the Pioneer apparent acceleration remains

relatively constant with time.  Moreover, an anomalous acceleration of similar magnitude does not

appear to be acting on the planets, given that their orbital periods experience no similar secular
change within the accuracy of current determinations.(2)

It is here suggested that this linear blueshifting is instead due to a continual spontaneous

increase in photon frequency which local photons normally undergo, but which until now has

passed unnoticed due to the small size of the effect.  For example, the rate of frequency shifting
implied by the Pioneer 10 data, 2.28 ± 0.4 X 10-18 s-1, would be many orders of magnitude smaller
than rates detectable in the laboratory.  Over a laboratory photon travel distance of 100 meters this
would amount to a frequency change of one part in 10 24, as compared with the U.S. Naval
Observatory hydrogen maser clock system which is stable to only one part in 1015 for a one day
integration time.

This alternative interpretation explains in a straightforward manner the anomalous frequency
shifting of the Pioneer spacecraft signals by means of a phenomenon that has no effect on planet
orbits.  But, more importantly, the observed effect was predicted over a decade before the
announced discovery of the Pioneer anomaly, being first mentioned in 1980 and described in later
publications to be a necessary consequence of the subquantum kinetics physics methodology.(3 - 7)
In 1980, the author had proposed an experiment that could test for this blueshifting effect by
transponding a maser signal between two spacecraft separated by a distance of 5 AU (e.g.,
positioned at 1 AU and 6 AU) and the return signal being measured to determine whether its
frequency had increased at the predicted average rate of µ ~ 1.3 ± 0.65 X 10-18 s-1.  The beam was
to be modulated with regularly spaced pulses whose period in the return beam could be compared

to the initial pulse period to determine the relative movement of the craft.  In this way the Doppler

component of the maser signal's frequency change would be known so that a check could be made

2

for the presence in the beam of a nonDoppler frequency shift residual.

At that time in 1980, the author had contacted Frank Estabrook at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

(JPL), one of John Anderson's colleagues, and inquired about the possibility of conducting such a
space-based experiment.(8)  But at that time his group was mainly interested in using spacecraft
maser signal residuals as a way of detecting gravity waves and testing the predictions of general
relativity.(9 - 11)  Nevertheless this discussion gave assurance that a maser signal traveling over the
course of a 10 AU roundtrip journey would accrue a frequency shift large enough to be marginally

measurable above the background noise that would be present in the return signal due to

disturbance by the solar plasma.  A description of this proposed maser signal experiment was

submitted for journal publication in 1980 and was later documented in expositions of subquantum
kinetics published in 1985 and 1994.(3, 4, 6)

Subquantum kinetics predicts that the magnitude of the blueshifting rate varies linearly with the

magnitude of the local ambient gravitational potential.  Hence, compared with the value in the Earth's
environs (1.3  X 10-18 s-1), for signals transponded from Earth to a spacecraft such as Pioneer 10
located at 65 AU, it predicts a slightly lower blueshifting rate of µ ~ 1.1 ± 0.6 X 10-18 s-1.  This
prediction is strikingly close the observed Pioneer 10 value, being about half of the observed rate.

If the Pioneer spacecraft tracking anomaly remains unexplained by more conventional phenomena,

such as waste heat radiation, then the observed anomalous frequency shift may be a legitimate

verification of this previously documented subquantum kinetics blueshifting prediction.

2.  THE PHOTON BLUESHIFTING PREDICTION

Subquantum kinetics postulates that the electric and gravitational field potentials that form

photons, subatomic particles, and zero-point energy fluctuations, arise as inhomogeneities in an

underlying, all-pervading plenum whose constituents engage in well-defined nonequilibrium
reaction-diffusion processes which are represented by a nonlinear equation system; see Ref. [4 - 6]
for a full explanation.  The electric field potential solutions of this equation system exhibit

nonconservative as well as conservative behavior depending upon the value of the ambient
gravitational potential, ϕ
g, relative to a critical potential value ϕ

gc; see Figure 1.(4, 6)    Hence in
subquantum kinetics, perfect energy conservation, photon energy remaining constant with the
passage of time, is the exception rather than the rule, occurring only when this underlying reaction
system operates at its critical threshold.  For example, the system would operate at this threshold of
marginal stability in regions of space bounding the fringes of galaxies where the ambient gravity
g > ϕ
potential approaches the critical threshold value; i.e., where ϕ
gc,
such as in a galaxy's gravity well, supercritical conditions would prevail, dictating a progressive
increase in photon energy with the passage of time and spontaneous photon blueshifting.  In

gc.  In regions where ϕ

g = ϕ

intergalactic regions of space where gravity potential attains positive values relative to the critical
threshold, ϕ

gc, subcritical conditions would prevail, dictating a progressive decrease in photon

g < ϕ

energy with the passage of time and photon redshifting.  Photons traveling from distant galaxies

would be subject to predominantly subcritical conditions along their flight path and hence would

undergo a redshift scaling in proportion to their distance or time of travel.  This "tired-light" effect

model has been shown to make a good fit to cosmological redshift data on a variety of cosmology

tests.(12 - 14)  The nonconservative energy behavior predicted by subquantum kinetics does not

contradict the first law of thermodynamics, since the First Law strictly applies to closed systems,

whereas the nonequilibrium subquantum reactions postulated in subquantum kinetics instead
constitute an open system.

The absolute value of the gravitational potential is important in that as a control factor it

determines not only whether a photon will be in an energy gaining or energy losing mode, but also

the degree to which photons will depart from perfect energy conservation, i.e., the rate at which

photon energy will either increase or decrease.  Subquantum kinetics represents the time

dependence of photon energy by the following general relation:

E(t) = E0eµt ,

where  µ = -α(ϕ

gc  is  the  critical  threshold  gravity  potential  and  α is a
ϕ
proportionality constant having units of time/area (e.g., s/cm2).

In order to simplify the above equation, let us assign a value of zero to the critical threshold ϕ

(3)

Note that this frequency shift is a new effect that is not predicted by standard physics theories

and should therefore not be confused with the better known gravitational frequency shift

phenomenon which arises due to the difference in ambient gravity potential between the region of

photon emission and region of photon reception.  The hypothesized phenomenon would occur even

when there is virtually no net change of gravity potential, as in the case of maser signals

transponded over a round-trip path.  Also unlike the gravitational redshift, the proposed

phenomenon should have no observable effect on photon emission processes, since many hours are

required before a photon has accumulated a frequency shift large enough to be observed, and even

then the amount is very slight.  So, this effect should not be observable in stellar spectra.  Over a

distance of 10 kpc, photons traveling from a distant star would accumulate a blueshift of

approximately 0.3 km/s, an amount that would be insignificant in comparison to shifts attributable

to the conventional gravitational frequency shift phenomenon.

To  provide  a  realistic  cosmology,  the  reaction-diffusion  system  postulated  as  the  basis  of

subquantum kinetics must operate very close to its threshold of marginal stability in an initially

subcritical state prevailing during the era prior to the emergence of quanta.  This allows the reaction

system to spawn material particles out of the prevailing zero-point energy fluctuation background.

Moreover by designing the reaction system so that the parameter regulating system criticality is

identified with gravity potential, the reaction system is able to generate supercritical conditions in the

vicinity of materialized particles and celestial bodies (i.e., in gravity wells) thereby ensuring that

their forms are sustained over time.  As a consequence of this cosmology, photons traveling in

supercritical regions within celestial bodies and in their environs would gradually blueshift.  The

manner in which a photon's field potential would evolve over time is specified by Eq. (1) above.

To take the next step and make a quantitative prediction of the rate of photon blueshifting that
would be expected for a given gravity potential value, one must constrain the reaction system model
with observation.   Since the subquantum level is inherently unobservable, its variables being hidden
from us, in order to constrain the constants in Eq. (1) we are left to use physical observations such
as bolometric luminosities for the Sun and planets.  This may be done by adjusting parameter α
and the value assumed for the galactic gravity background potential, ϕ
gal, to give a realistic value of
µ as a function of ϕ
g such that the resulting energy blueshifting rate yields the correct bolometric
luminosities for these celestial bodies.  This modeling was done in earlier discussions of the photon
blueshifting effect,(3, 5) and is reviewed and updated in the next section.  Once this modeling was
done and the subquantum kinetics photon blueshifting prediction was accordingly defined, the

resulting blueshifting rate then emerged as a testable prediction, one that could later be checked

5

through the proposed maser signal experiment.  As is shown below, the Pioneer spacecraft data

later confirmed this prediction.

Understandably, subquantum kinetics takes a different approach than that used in general

relativity.  For example, its gravitational effects are not theorized to result from a warping of space-

time.  Rather, effects such as gravitational attraction or repulsion, gravitational time dilation, and the

bending of starlight by celestial bodies are effects that emerge as consequences of the postulated
subquantum reactions.(14)  The postulated subquantum reaction processes also predict that electric
and gravitational potential fields should be coupled at all energies, a result that has been verified.(4,
14)  Note that the proposal that gravity potential controls the rate of photon energy change, itself
presupposes the existence of a link between gravitational and electric potential fields.  Hence

subquantum kinetics qualifies as a unified field theory.

3. EARLY MODELING OF THE AMPLIFICATION COEFFICIENT

Equation (3) predicts that the energy reservoir within a celestial body should spontaneously

generate excess energy ("genic" energy) through this photon blueshifting effect at a rate equal to
the product of the blueshifting rate coefficient µ and the reservoir's total heat capacity, H:

Lg  =  dE/dt  =  µH  ~  α ϕ –

CM

–
T ,

(4)

where H is given approximately as the product of the body's average specific heat –
–
T .(4, 6)  This blueshifting effect is expected to act in the same way on all
average internal temperature 
photons regardless of their frequency.  In this model, heat capacities Hi are estimated for each body
based on the body's mass, and on a reasonable estimate of its average internal temperature and
specific heat.  Furthermore, a planet's average internal gravity potential is modeled to be
approximately ϕ
potential contribution from the Sun at the planet's heliocentric distance, and ϕ

0 is its surface gravity potential, ϕsun is the gravity

C , mass M, and

gal , where ϕ

0 + ϕsun + ϕ

g = 2 ϕ

gal is an additional

background factor contributed by the Galaxy as a whole relative to the local intergalactic
background potential.  When variables α and ϕ

gal are properly chosen, Eq. (4) is found to account

for most or all of the internal energy output observed to come from the interiors of the planets
Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.(5, 6)  Genic energy luminosities Lg estimated for the
Sun, planets, and Sirius B are presented in Table I along

C,   M, and

The photon blueshifting predicted for the Earth environs is so small as to be undetectable in the

laboratory, but it should be large enough to be measurable over interplanetary distances.  Using the
modeled values for α and ϕ
one would expect to find in interplanetary space.  That is, expressing Eq. (3) as µ  =  αϕ

gal, it is possible to make a testable prediction of the blueshifting rate

The  values  for  the  model  parameters  listed  in  Table  I  were  determined  as  follows.    For  all  celestial  bodies
gal = -4 × 1013 cm2/s2,  which
considered here, the gravity potential is calculated relative to a background value of ϕ
includes the gravity potential contribution of the Galaxy, galaxy cluster, and supercluster.  The average internal
gravity potential ϕ
o =
-M(cid:1)kg/R(cid:1) , kg being the gravitational constant and R(cid:1) being the Sun's radius.  The internal gravity potentials for the
planets, including the Earth and Moon, are calculated as: ϕ
sun = -M(cid:1) kg/r represents
the contribution from the Sun's gravity potential field at the planet's heliocentric distance, r.  The ϕ
g values for the
planets are dominated primarily by the Galactic component.  In the case of Sirius B, the potential is calculated to be
g = 2ϕ

of the results of the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory solar neutrino experiment.

Values adopted for the average specific heats and internal temperatures are the same as those given in reference [4]
with  the  exception  of  the  temperature  for  Sirius  B.    For  a  reasonable  fit  to  be  made  to  the  observed  bolometric
luminosity (Li ) for Sirius B, we must choose an average temperature for its interior that is an order of magnitude
lower  than  temperatures  normally  modeled  for  its  core.    This  is  permissible  if  it  is  assumed  to  have  a  deep
convective layer capable of easily conveying heat to its surface.  The Li data point for Sirius B is taken from F.

αM(cid:1)G/r, where M(cid:1) is the Sun's mass, r is the maser photon's heliocentric distance in AU, and G is
the gravitational constant, and choosing α = 2.62 X 10-32 s/cm2 and ϕ

gal  = -4 X 1013 cm2/s2, the

interplanetary blueshifting rate at a given distance r from the Sun is given as:

µ = (1.05  + 

 ) X 10-18.

0. 22
r

(5)

According to Eq. (5), a maser signal making a round-trip journey between the Earth and a
spacecraft located at 65 AU would blueshift at the average rate of µ ~ 1.05 X 10-18 s-1, the second
term in the equation making a negligible contribution.  This falls close to blueshifting rates later
observed for signals transponded back from Pioneer 10 and 11.

Eq. (5) predicts that the rate of blueshifting should be greater at times when the maser signal

transponded between the Earth and the spacecraft has a trajectory that takes it near the Sun.  Hence

7

the blueshifting incurred over the round-trip signal path between the Earth and spacecraft would be

expected to fall to a minimum when the spacecraft was at solar opposition and to rise to a sharp

peak when the spacecraft approached solar conjunction, at which point the maser signal would at
one point reach a minimum heliocentric distance of r = 5 X 10-4 AU.  The modeled α and ϕ values
predict that this annual effect should cause the cumulative round-trip blueshift to vary by about
± 2%.  Anderson et al. do report an annual variation in the magnitude of the Pioneer spacecraft
anomalous acceleration which is similarly strongly peaked at solar conjunction and falls to a

minimum at solar opposition.  However, the annual variation they observe is much larger, on the
order of ±30% of the average blueshifting rate; see Figure 1 of Ref. 15) or Figure 14 of Ref. (2).
They propose that this variation may be due to unexplained modeling errors in the Earth's orbital

orientation or in the accuracy of the planetary ephemeris.  If such is the case, until they are

corrected, these modeling error uncertainties will mask the annual variation predicted by Eq. (5).

Due to the uncertainty in knowing the true value of the Galactic gravity potential in the Sun's

vicinity, ϕ

gal   is used here as a modeling variable whose value, together with that of coefficient α, is
chosen so that Eq. 4 makes a best overall fit to the bolometric luminosities of the Sun and planets.
In an earlier paper describing this predicted blueshifting effect,(5) these variables were instead
modeled as α = 5.23 X 10-32 s/cm2 and ϕ
luminosity data, which specified the blueshifting coefficient as µ = (1.05  +  0.46

gal  = -2 X 1013 cm2/s2, for their fit to observed

 ) X 10-18.  The

r

revised values reflect a fit to new luminosity data which requires a lower genic energy contribution

to the Sun's bolometric luminosity.  Nevertheless, at large r these two models make essentially the

same prediction, deviating by < 0.6% at r = 40 AU.  Hence in regard to the Pioneer maser data, both
models predict essentially the same average blueshifting rate for µ since this data spans heliocentric
distances ranging from ~20 to 65 AU where the second term is very small.  Future space based

experiments carried out in the inner solar system region around 1 AU should determine whether the

second term in Eq. (5) is properly modeled.

Note that the earlier published derivation of µ was done with no foreknowledge of the Pioneer
Effect since the latter had not been discovered at that point.  Also adjustments of this µ value made
in the present paper were made solely with the intent to arrive at an adequate fit to the solar and
planetary luminosity data.  For example, this new fit makes a much lower genic energy prediction
for the Sun, which accords with the updated lower main sequence M-L data discussed below.  This
new adjustment of the values of α and ϕ
gal  took into account no consideration of the Pioneer Effect
results.  Moreover, as noted above, the earlier and present model predictions for µ make the same
quantitative prediction for the Pioneer data.  Hence the subquantum kinetics blueshifting prediction
stands as a valid a priori prediction.

The modeled value of ϕ

gal  = -4 X 1013 cm2/s2 is low compared to what standard theories
predict for the Galactic contribution to the local gravity potential.  However, it is nevertheless

consistent with observation.  For example, Olling and Merrifield have modeled the Milky Way's

rotation and found that the available data is best fit if the galactocentric distance for the Sun is set at

8

r0 = 7.1 ± 0.4 kpc with a solar orbital velocity of v0 = 184 ± 8 km/s.(16 - 19)  These values are
smaller than those of other Galaxy dynamics models, which assume r0 = 8.5 kpc and v0 = 220
km/s.  However, a smaller value for r0 is corroborated by the best primary measurements which
place the galactocentric distance at 7.2 ± 0.7 kpc.(20)  Olling and Merrifield estimate a mass for the
Galaxy's central bulge  of Mb ~ 8.3 X 109 M(cid:1), based on a bulge k-band luminosity of Lb ~ 1.5 X
1010 L(cid:1)  and a mass-luminosity ratio of 0.55.(19)  For a galactocentric distance of r0 = 7.1 kpc, this
would contribute a gravity potential of -5 X 1013 cm2/s2 to the solar vicinity.  Gerhard (21) estimates
a larger mass for the galactic bulge of 1.3 X 1010 M(cid:1) which predicts a larger contribution of -7.8 X
1013 cm2/s2.  The Galaxy's disc makes a smaller contribution to the local gravitational potential.
Kuijken and Gilmore have determined that the matter column density within 1.1 kpc of the galactic
plane is Σ1.1 kpc = 71± 6 M(cid:1)/pc2 which includes the halo contribution as well.(22)  Integrating this
contribution out to a distance of 7 kpc yields a  gravity potential contribution to the solar vicinity of
2π rGΣ1.1 kpc  = -4.2 ± 0.4 X 1013 cm2/s2.  Hence including the larger estimate for the bulge
contribution, the total Galactic gravity potential contribution to the solar vicinity would be ∆ϕ
-12± 3 X 1013 cm2/s2.

Subquantum kinetics predicts that over great distances the gravity potential field should taper

off to a plateau in intergalactic space, each galaxy's field being effective n its own gravity well
locale.(4, 6).  This is similar in many respects to MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics) which is
an observationally based approach that allows the plateau in galaxy orbital velocities to be modeled
without introducing assumptions about outlying hidden mass.(23 - 25)  In subquantum kinetics,
however, this field tapering emerges as a prediction of the theory itself which requires that potential
fields be slightly nonsolenoidal, that at large r the gravity potential should be less negative than
would be expected from the Newtonian 1/r relation.  Translated into more familiar terms, this would
be similar to summing a galaxy's potential at a given point with the potential produced by a
distributed background of "virtual antimatter" which presents a negative mass density (positive ϕ

g).

At increasing distances from a galaxy, an increasing volume of this negative mass would be

encompassed within the sphere defined by that radial distance and this would have the effect of

9

increasingly screening the galaxy's positive mass, progressively reducing its potential from what
would normally be predicted by a Newtonian 1/r law.  Thus if this distributed background is taken
to be equivalent to a negative mass density of ρ = -10-30 g/cm3, which approximates the negative of
the intergalactic mass density, then a Galaxy of mass 5 X 1010 M(cid:1) would have its gravity field
entirely screened at a galactocentric distance of 3 million light years at which point the gradient of

its potential field would be zero.  To satisfy MOND, a more rapid attenuation of the gravity field

would be required, MOND requiring that attenuation of the gravitational force begins to be
noticeable when the field's gravitational acceleration has diminished below a critical threshold of a0
= 10-8 cm/s2.

The idea of a truncated range for gravity is consistent with the observation of Tifft that
neighboring and distant galaxies do not appear to dynamically interact with one another.(26)
Moreover others have argued on theoretical grounds that a range limit to gravity would avoid

problems associated with space having an arbitrarily high or infinite value for its gravity potential
contribution from extragalactic sources.(27)  A finite range for gravity would be problematic for
models that predict galaxy formation through gradual accretion of a primordial gas cloud.

However, this is not a problem with nonstandard creation models such as subquantum kinetics

which predict galaxy formation through continuous matter creation in a galaxy's core and gradual

outward growth with later stage formation of spiral arms, a scenario supported by Hubble telescope
observations of distant galaxies.(14)

4. ASTROPHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF PHOTON BLUESHIFTING

The existence of photon blueshifting and the resulting production of "genic energy" would have

significant implications for astrophysics in that genic energy would make a major contribution as a

stellar power source, supplementing nuclear fusion and gravitational accretion.  For example, Eq.

(4) predicts that red dwarfs, brown dwarfs, and planets should be powered exclusively by genic
energy and should share a common mass-luminosity relation of approximately L ∝ M2.7 ± 0.9; see
ref. (5) for details.  In fact, the jovian planets are seen to lie along the lower main sequence stellar
mass-luminosity relation which, using the data of Harris et al.,(22) is of the form L ∝ M2.76  ±  0.15;
see Fig. 2.(5, 6)  The brown dwarfs LP 944-20, G 196-3B, and GL 229B (29-32) also are found to lie
close to this line confirming earlier predictions.(4 - 6)  These correspondences provide strong
confirmation for the subquantum kinetics blueshifting prediction since on standard theory they
must be passed off as pure coincidence.

Between 0.4 M(cid:1) and 0.6 M(cid:1) (L ≈ 0.025 - 0.05 L(cid:1)), the mass-luminosity relation becomes

somewhat scattered and less well defined.  It is in this transition region where the upper main
sequence mass-luminosity relation begins, the M-L relation changing to a steeper slope of L ∝ M4;
(dashed line in Fig. 2).  This transition would signify the point where nuclear burning begins to

make a noticeable contribution, supplementing genic energy production.  When projected to lower

masses, the upper main sequence M-L relation is found to intersect the lower main sequence M-L

10

in relation to the lower main sequence stellar mass-luminosity relation.

relation at around 0.4 M(cid:1).  But the lower main sequence relation data trend does not entirely
disappear until a somewhat higher mass is reached, possibly around 0.6 to 0.7 M(cid:1).  The luminosity

gap evident between the lower and upper main sequence relations would indicate the additional
contribution provided by nuclear fusion, nuclear burning providing a progressively larger share of a

star's total radiated energy as stellar mass increases.

In this mass range of 0.2 to 0.5 M(cid:1), where the lower main sequence transitions to the upper
main sequence, the lower log M-log L relation gradually bends downward to a slightly lower slope.

11

Figure 3. A nonlinear curve fit to red dwarf mass-luminosity data.

The circle in the upper right hand corner is the indicated value when
the regression is projected up to 1 M(cid:1).

This may be seen in Figure 3, which plots a nonlinear regression curve fit made to log M and log L
data for red dwarfs in the mass range 0.06 M(cid:1) through 0.6 M(cid:1).  The plotted values are listed in
Table II.  In cases where the cited sources list visual magnitudes instead of luminosity values,
bolometric luminosities are calculated using the models of Baraffe, et al. by knowing the spectral
classifications of the respective stars.(33)   This downward bend, or "plateau," has also previously
been noted by Henry et al. who have attributed the effect partly to a deepening of a star's convective
region as stellar mass increases.(34)

When extrapolated upward to 1 M(cid:1), the resulting regression line projects a bolometric

luminosity of 0.16 ± 0.07 L(cid:1) for the Sun.  Subquantum kinetics, then, predicts that around 16% of

the Sun's energy should be of non-nuclear genic origin with the remaining majority being supplied
by nuclear fusion.(35)  While the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory solar neutrino experiment results
have resolved the mystery as to why other solar neutrino experiments had previously reported low
solar neutrino fluxes, the proposal that fusion may provide only 84 ± 7 % of the Sun's energy is
nevertheless tolerable in view of the range of uncertainty of stellar fusion models.

If the existence of the photon blueshifting phenomenon is acknowledged, all stellar evolution

models will need to be revised.  As described in previous publications, genic energy is also able to

account for high-luminosity white dwarfs and X-ray stars and can explain how certain quasars are

able to power themselves in the absence of nearby gas and dust, a recognized problem for black
hole theory.(4 - 6, 14)  Moreover genic energy can account for phenomena such as stellar pulsation,
novae, and supernovae.  That is, since photon blueshifting can feed back to increase a star's internal

temperature and heat capacity which in turn increases the rate at which energy is produced, this
inherent nonlinearity can ultimately lead to instability.

In an earlier 1985 paper, the author pointed out that the photon blueshifting rate estimated for

photons traveling in the solar system was approximately the same magnitude as the energy
attenuation rate needed to account for the cosmological redshift, but of opposite sign;(4, 6)  and more
recently, discoverers of the Pioneer Effect have similarly noted that the blueshifting anomaly has a
magnitude comparable to H0.(2)  In fact, the revised estimate of the Pioneer data blueshifting rate
discussed below (2.28 ± 0.4 X 10-18 s-1) is exactly equal in magnitude to the negative Hubble
constant value, the subquantum kinetics prediction being about half this amount.  In the context of

subquantum kinetics, this correspondence between the predicted Pioneer maser signal blueshifting

rate and the cosmological redshifting rate would be an indication that the value of the gravitational

13

potential for regions of space within galaxies does not depart far below the critical threshold, just as

the intergalactic value of the gravitational potential does not depart far above the critical threshold.

This is consistent with the requirement in subquantum kinetics that the underlying subquantum

reaction-diffusion system operates very close to the threshold of marginal stability, and that it had

resided predominantly in a subcritical state during the period preceding the emergence of matter in

supercritical regions.  If the subquantum reactions had not initially operated near its critical

threshold, they would have had little chance of spawning material particles out of the zero-point

energy fluctuation background.

5.  ADJUSTING THE PIONEER BLUESHIFTING ANOMALY DATA FOR

UNMODELED THERMAL EFFECTS

As mentioned above, the magnitude of the Pioneer anomalous acceleration effect reported by
Anderson et al. should be reduced to 82% of its value to take into account the propulsive effects
due to waste heat radiated from the spacecraft.  For example, Scheffer, Katz, and Murphy have

suggested that a portion of the apparent anomalous acceleration acting on the Pioneer spacecraft

may be due to thermal radiation striking the anti-solar side of its antenna coming from the passive

radiators used to cool the spacecraft's electronics, from its RTG power unit, and from various other
sources.(36 - 38)  Scheffer's model predicts that the thrust from these thermal sources should have
declined by 11.8% from "Period I" (~10/1988) through "Period III" (~7/1995) due to a decline in

available spacecraft power and changes in the types of experiments being carried out.  Instead, a

much smaller rate of decrease in acceleration is seen.  The SIGMA WLS values computed for the

anomalous Pioneer 10 acceleration, listed in Table I of Ref. [2], indicate a decrease of 2% from

Period I to Period III, whereas the CHASMP WLS values indicate a decrease of 4.1% over this

same time period.  Averaging these two values, it appears that the spacecraft's acceleration decreased
by about 3.05 ± 1% over this period.(39)  Consequently, if this 3% decrease is entirely due to the
above unmodeled heating effects, these effects would be responsible for at most

(3.05 ± 1%)/11.8% = 26 ± 9% of the anomalous "acceleration."  Although Eq. (5) indicates there
should be some degree of decrease in µ as the spacecraft's heliocentric distance progressively
increases, this decline would be very slight, only 0.15% during the above mentioned interval.

Anderson et al., however, maintain that such unmodeled thermal effects account for a much
smaller percentage of the anomalous apparent acceleration,(2,40-42) and include a bias correction of
only -0.55 X 10-8 cm/s2 to take into account the propulsive effect of heat radiated from the RTG
unit; see Table II of Ref. [2].  They find no variation in Pioneer 10's computed acceleration over a
certain period from mid 1992 to mid 1998 and offer this as evidence that the unmodeled thermal
effects play a minor role.  However, since their trend line was calculated from data that included the

±30% annual variation described above, their regression line slope will very much depend on which

dates they pick to begin and end their trend-line average.  Consequently, a 3% secular decline may

14

still be present in their data yet be masked by the much larger irregular annual variation.  Hence a

negative conclusion in regard to a decline in spacecraft acceleration is unwarranted.

The above discussion of Scheffer's thermal effects model, suggests that the anomalous

acceleration value of 8.7 ± 1.3 X 10-8 cm/s2 reported by Anderson, et al. should be reduced by the
additional amount of 1.86 ± 1.3 X 10-8 cm/s2, i.e., 0.26 ×  (8.7 + 0.55) ×  10-8 -0.55 ×  10-8 cm/s2,
to give an unexplained residual of 6.85 ± 1.3 X 10-8 cm/s2.  Expressed in terms of photon
blueshifting, this residual would amount to 2.28 ± 0.4 X 10-18 s-1, which comes strikingly close to
the blueshifting rate predicted by subquantum kinetics.

6.  GALILEO RANGING MEASUREMENTS.

If the unexplained frequency shift phenomenon is a Doppler shift produced by an anomalous

force acting on the spacecraft, as Anderson et al. have suggested, then one should observe a
corresponding change in the spacecraft's range relative to the Earth.  That is, the spacecraft should

be found to be closer than would otherwise be expected.  If the frequency shift instead arises

spontaneously as a nonDoppler blueshift affecting only the transponded maser signal, as

subquantum kinetics predicts, then one should expect to find no corresponding change in spacecraft

range.  Unfortunately, the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft were not outfitted for ranging
measurements.  So Anderson et al. attempted to check for the presence of ranging anomalies by
comparing the ranging and "Doppler shift" data received from the Galileo spacecraft.  Ranging

measurements were made by modulating the outgoing maser beam with markers and observing the

time taken for a given marker to be transponded back to Earth.  The Doppler shift measurements
were made by comparing the frequencies of the outgoing and incoming maser beams.  Anderson et
al. claim that the marker timing measurements showed a decrease in spacecraft range approximating
the amount that would be expected if the anomalous blueshifting they observe in their Doppler shift
data were due to unmodeled forces acting on the spacecraft.(2)  Consequently, they concluded that
the data did not favor the alternative explanation of spontaneous frequency blueshifting, which they

alternatively construe as the "time acceleration" hypothesis.

However, there are reasons for doubting their conclusion.  For one thing, the data they used was
recorded relatively close to the Sun (1 to 5 AU) while the Galileo spacecraft was traveling from near
the Earth to Jupiter, a region where solar radiation pressure and solar plasma effects dominate the
measurements.  By comparison, Anderson et al. began studying the Doppler signal data from the
Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft only after these spacecraft had surpassed a distance of 20 AU, at
which point solar radiation pressure acceleration had decreased to < 5 X 10-8 cm/s2.  The same
measure of caution should be applied to the Galileo ranging and Doppler measurements, raising the
question as to the reliability of that data.  In fact, Anderson et al. state that the solution they obtained
for the Galileo spacecraft Doppler measurement data was so highly correlated with solar pressure

and so complicated by mid-course orbital maneuvers that a standard null result could not be ruled

out.  They also acknowledge that the signal-to-noise ratio on the incoming range signal was small,

15

requiring long integration times during which time the range of the spacecraft was constantly

changing at a rate of ~6 km/s.  Additional uncertainty was introduced because the identification of

the code for the appropriate received ranging signal was inferred, sometimes with great difficulty,

from the orbit determination programs.

Moreover, as mentioned above, Anderson et al. question the accuracy of the solar system

modeling programs they used, speculating that modeling errors in these programs may be the cause

of the large unexplained annual variation observed in residual acceleration.  In the case of Pioneer

10 and 11, as the spacecraft progressed from 40 AU to 70 AU, the maser signal path length varied

by a small percentage, about ±2%, due to distance variation arising from the movement of the Earth

about the Sun (±1 AU  vs . 55 AU), yet their data charted a large annual variation of ±25%.  By

comparison, Galileo's measurements were made 20 times closer to the Sun in the vicinity of 1 - 5

AU where the annual variation of the maser signal path length, relative to the total distance to the

spacecraft, was at least 25 times greater.  In this near solar environment, the variable annual
component of the acceleration would have substantially exceeded the nonvarying component

making ranging determinations even more uncertain.  Furthermore, when a maser signal passes

through the solar plasma, ranging measurements will experience a time delay, making the calculated

spacecraft distance abnormally large, whereas the transponded return signal used in making the

Doppler frequency comparison will experience a phase advance, making the calculated inferred

spacecraft distance abnormally small.

Although ranging data was also available from the Ulysses spacecraft, those measurements were

considered even less reliable than those from Galileo.  In summary, the measurements that
Anderson et al. used to rule out the spontaneous photon blueshifting effect are, by their own
admission, fraught with difficulty.  Hence their range change conclusion should be viewed with

caution.

If the Pioneer Effect is in fact due to a spontaneous change in photon energy, as subquantum

kinetics predicts and is not due to an anomalous force acting on the spacecraft, then it will be

necessary to adjust for this effect in Doppler tracking of spacecraft.  For example, consider the
anomalous force of 8.7 X 10-8 cm/s2 which Anderson et al. suggest acts on the Pioneer 10
spacecraft.  If this is imagined to be real and to have acted on the spacecraft for a full 30 years, then
navigators will place the craft's position 390,000 km closer to the Sun than if the force were believed
to be absent and the blueshifting due to a nonDoppler blueshifting effect.  This is about the distance
from the Earth to the Moon, and could result in quite a large error if the nature of the blueshifting is
misjudged.

7. FUTURE EXPERIMENTS AND CONCLUSION

A definitive resolution of the issue of whether Doppler and ranging anomalies really exist may

have to await a future out-of-solar system spacecraft mission such as the Pluto/Kuiper mission

scheduled for launch around 2006 and which includes very sophisticated tracking technology.  In

16

addition, as a result of efforts by Turyshev et al.,(43) the European Space Agency has suggested that

a new spacecraft experiment be launched into the outer solar system around 2015  to exclusively

test the Pioneer Effect.  The experiment would be designed to characterize the properties of the

anomaly to an accuracy of at least two orders of magnitude below the anomaly's size.

Another possibility would be to make modifications to the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna

(LISA) so that it could detect the predicted effect.  LISA, which is due to be launched in 2010,

involves three spacecraft placed in the Earth's solar orbit separated from one another by 5 million

kilometers to form three legs of a triangle with a phase-locked laser beam along each leg.(44)

Although the experiment is planned to be carried out fairly close to the Sun (~1 AU), solar plasma

has little effect on laser beam transmission, hence should not pose a problem.  LISA will be able to
detect accelerations of as little as 10-13 cm/s2 (equivalent to a frequency shift rate of ~10-23 s-1),
which is about 105 times smaller than the predicted effect.  However, the experiment is currently
being designed primarily for the purpose of detecting low frequency gravity waves in the milli Hz
frequency range and as such is not focused on detecting a "DC" effect similar to that produced by

the Pioneer anomaly, whether it be a constant accelerating force or a constant nonDoppler photon

blueshifting effect.(45)

However, it should be possible to check for the Pioneer effect.  At 1 AU from the Sun, the
predicted genic energy effect is expected to blueshift each laser beam at the rate of 1.27 ± 0.7 ×
10-18 s-1, making the beam accumulate a frequency shift of 4.2 X 10-17 by the end of its 107 km
roundtrip.  For a beam wavelength of 1 µm, (f = 3 X 1014 Hz), this would amount to a frequency
difference of ∆f = 0.0127 Hz.  The resulting interference pattern would move through one fringe
cycle every 1/∆f = 79  seconds toward the lower frequency reference laser.  This effect would be the
same for each leg of the triangle regardless of each beam's orientation.  LISA will be using
photodiode detectors having an interferometer fringe resolution of 4 X 10-5 λ/ Hz  which would
allow this net fringe drift to be easily detected.

A nonDoppler frequency shift effect may be distinguished from Doppler shifts arising from

relative drifting of the spacecraft by modulating the laser beam with regularly spaced AM pulses or

polarization shift markers.  Any change in the period of these time markers would indicate
exclusively the Doppler component of the frequency shift since the marker period would be
relatively immune to any change in laser frequency.  If the laser transponder is instructed to return
a signal that is offset from the original laser frequency by twice the Doppler frequency shift, this

would effectively null out the Doppler component when the transponded signal is received back,

and would leave the photon blueshifting effect to appear in the data coming from each leg as the
primary fringe drift residual.  If the Pioneer effect were instead due to an anomalous force pulling
spacecraft toward the Sun, it should accelerate all three LISA spacecraft at approximately the same
rate and hence would be expected to yield no net frequency shift effect.

It is hoped that the necessary design modifications will be made to LISA to allow a test to be

made of this important physical effect.  As a follow-up to LISA, a similar experiment could later be

17

conducted closer to the Sun where the ambient gravity potential is more negative and where

subquantum kinetics predicts that higher blueshifting rates should be observed.  Until these

experiments are carried out, the subquantum kinetics blueshifting prediction should provide a useful

alternative to consider in interpreting the Pioneer 10 and 11 tracking anomaly.

blueshifting effect in the Pioneer data first became noticeable in 1980, however, at that time they

would not go away, that the JPL team concluded that the data should be more closely examined

[M. Nieto, private communication].  Thereafter the anomaly was mentioned publicly for the first

time at a 1994 conference and in that same year a serious study of the data was begun which

communication with JPL suggesting the existence of such a blueshifting effect would predate
even the early stages of the discovery of this effect in the Pioneer maser data.  When I contacted
F. Estabrook of JPL in 1980, he had indicated that they were unaware of any persistent
blueshift in spacecraft maser data.

[35] In previous publications [4-7] the lower main sequence M-L relation had been assumed to

have a linear log-log plot in which case its upward projection indicated a luminosity of about
0.58 L(cid:1).  On this basis it had been proposed that ~58% of the Sun's energy was of non-

nuclear, genic energy origin.  This has now been revised downward to 16% based on the new
data presented in Table II, which indicates that the relation bends down at its upper end.

[42] In the cited references, Anderson et al. propose that the decline in computed acceleration from

interval I to interval III was somehow associated with a change in the spacecraft's spin rate,

although they do not explain how spin rate might induce this effect.

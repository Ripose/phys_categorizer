Summary. -

 A good candidate to the role of passive gravitational mass of a Schwarzschild’s

incompressible  sphere  is  represented  by  the  substantielle  Masse  of  the  sphere,  which  is

larger than the active gravitational mass. Presumably this inequality has a general validity, i.e.

it is not limited to the homogeneous spheres of incompressible fluids.

1.  -

  To  give  in  general  relativity  a  proper  definition  of  passive  gravitational  mass

(which, owing to the  generalized  Galileo’s  law,  coincides  with  the  inertial  mass)  is

not  a  plain  task,  see  e.g.  [1],  [2],  [3].  According  to  Møller  [1]  and  Rosen-

Cooperstock  [3],  the  passive  mass  is  always  equal  to  the  active  mass  (as  in  the

Newtonian theory), whereas Bonnor [2] finds that the passive mass is always larger

than  the  active  one.  It  seems  to  me  that  the  second  fundamental  memoir  by

Schwarzschild  [4]  yields  a  key  for  solving  the  puzzle.  In  this  memoir  the  Author

solves the problem of the gravitational  field generated by a  homogeneous sphere of

an  incompressible    fluid.  He  defines  two  different  concepts  of  mass  of  the  above

sphere,  the  attractive  (or  active)  gravitational  mass  and  the  substantial  mass

(substantielle Masse), which is greater than the active one. While the first concept

found a full acceptance in the scientific literature, as is well known, the concept of

substantial mass fell into oblivion; only Møller [4] discusses it, but almost  en passant

and  emphasizing 

that 

for  usual  astronomical  objects, 

if 

represented  by

Schwarzschildian  spheres,  the  substantial  mass  differs  very  little  from  the  active

mass.

I wish to show that Schwarzschild’s substantial mass is a good candidate to

the role of passive mass of an incompressible sphere. As remarked by  Bonnor  [2]

(whose  definition  of  passive  mass  of  a  Schwarzschild’s  sphere  does  not  coincide

with the substantial mass), it is unclear what are the consequences of the inequality

of the active and passive masses for motion of the bodies  -

  inequality  which  holds

likely 

in  general,  not  only  for 

the  mentioned  spheres.  Presumably 

these

consequences  are  less  drastic  than  in  Newtonian  dynamics,  by  virtue  of  the

conservation laws

 According to  Schwarzschild [4], the Einstein field of a homogeneous sphere of

an incompressible fluid is characterized by the following equations:

I propose to consider,  by virtue of its very definition, the substantial mass  V0

as

the passive gravitational mass of the sphere. Bonnor’s passive mass [2] is defined by

a disputable application of the generalized Galileo’s law -

 as remarked by Rosen and

Cooperstock  [3].  On  the  other  hand,  Møller  and  Rosen-Cooperstock  find  that  the

active  and  passive  masses  must  coincide,  but  their  proofs  rest  on  a  notion  of  very

dubious reliability, the pseudo energy-momentum of the gravity field.

3.  -

  Externally to  any  matter  distribution  of  spherical  symmetry  the  spacetime

interval is given by eq. (2.2), with a constant  r which depends on the structure of the

distribution. It is quite intuitive that  in general the active mass is different from the

substantial mass of the distribution, which we assume as coincident with the passive

gravitational mass. The reason of the inequality is “geometrical”: the real volume of

the  distribution  is  given  by  a  formula  (2.3),  while  the  active  mass  depends  on  a

“Euclidean” volume 

3R)34(
a

.

It is likely that the difference between the active and passive  masses  is  an

aesthetic defect of general relativity, whose practical importance should be not great.

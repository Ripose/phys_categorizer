Abstract 

Hamamatsu photomultiplier tubes (PMT) and various PMT window materials were exposed 
to  gamma  irradiation.  Tests  were  performed  with  absorbed  doses  of  1 krad  and  120 krad.  Initial 
recommendations on PMT types to use in the BTeV electromagnetic calorimeter are stated. 
 
1. Introduction 

The  electromagnetic  calorimeter  (EMCAL)  of  the  BTeV  detector  will  consist  of  Lead 
Tungstate (PbWO4, PWO) crystals and photomultiplier tubes. Radiation hardness of PWO crystals 
has  been  studied  very  carefully  for  many  years (see  Ref. [1], for example). Radiation hardness of 
PMTs,  which  will  also  be  crucial  elements  of  the  calorimeter,  still  needs  to  be  studied.  Because 
these  PMT’s  will  detect  scintillation  light  from  the  PWO  crystals,  reduction  in  the  PMT  window 
transparency  in  the  UV  region  will  crucially  affect  the  performance  of  EMCAL.  In  addition, 
exposure to high-energy gamma-rays with energies more than 1 MeV may increase the dark current 
considerably,  which  worsen  the  noise  performance  [2].  Charged  particles  may  damage  photo-
cathode,  dynode  system,  etc.  taking  into  account  the  specific  radiation  environment  in  which 
EMCAL will operates. 

The PWO crystals located in front of the PMT’s will act as radiation converters absorbing 
much of the energies of high-energy gamma rays, electrons and hadrons while producing many soft 
photons  and  neutrons  by  interactions,  PMTs  will  be  exposed  to  these  particles  in  addition  to 
primary hadrons, photons and electrons. Much work has been done to estimate the dose rate in the 
BTeV EMCAL environment [3] including flux of neutrons and very soft photons. Given the results 
of  this  study,  we  will  need  to  study  PMT  radiation  hardness  using  various  types  of  radiation  and 
various dose rates. 

The relationship between absorbed energy of radiation and radiation-induced effects is often 
not proportional but rather complex. In addition to the total radiation dose we often need to know 
the time dependence of the radiation, and the types and energies of the ionizing radiation. 

As  a  first  step  to  study  this  issue  experimentally  we  used  a  60Co  gamma  ray  source 
(E~1.25 MeV)  to  evaluate  radiation-induced  damage  of  PMT’s.  For  a  glass  such  as  SiO2  the 
Compton effect will dominate in interaction for low-energy (below 1 MeV) gamma rays. Given the 
typical thickness of PMT windows of 1-2 mm, the absorbed dose caused by soft gamma-quanta will 
be larger than the one caused by 1.25-MeV gamma rays at the same exposure dose, which is usually 
easier to evaluate. In other words, test with 1.25 MeV gamma-quanta gives us a lower limit on the 
effect arising from soft gamma rays. Dose values in our current study were chosen to be the same 
order of magnitude as they were calculated for the BTeV detector [3]. 

 

2. Experiments and Results 
2.1 Radiation damage studies of R5800 Hamamatsu PMT 
2.1.1  Investigated samples and experimental conditions 

Two  R5800  Hamamatsu  PMTs  (serial  numbers  CA0622  and  CA0641)  were  used  in  beam 
tests  prior  to  our  studies  but  there  was  no  indication  of  irreversible  effects  caused  by  previous 
irradiation  in  either  PMT.  We  have  used  one  of  them  (#CA0641)  for  our  irradiation  tests  and  the 
other  PMT  was  used  as  a  control  sample.  Stability  of  data  acquisition  system  was  periodically 
checked and was found to be as good as 1%. 

Irradiation was performed with a 60Co source (Eγ~1.25 MeV) whose activity provided about 
100 R/s exposure dose rate. Time of irradiation was ~15 minutes, so absorbed dose was estimated to 
be  about  120  krad.  Only  3.5%  of  BTeV  PMT’s  will  receive  this  much  absorbed  dose  in  a  year.  
Measurements of PMT properties were started in approximately 40 minutes after the completion of 
irradiation and took about five minutes. 

Changes  in  the  PMT  parameters  have  been  evaluated  using  average  pulse  height 
measurements at four wavelengths, two of which were generated by scintillator-based sources and 
two were produced by LED-based sources. Their parameters are listed in Table 1 below.

0622 (control sample) did not change throughout the study we show only one distribution for 
clarity. 
 

In  Fig. 2  we  have  summarized  relative  changes  of  amplitudes  of  the  signals  produced  by 
various  light  sources  after  irradiation.  One  can  see  here  that  R5800  PMT  has  the  largest 
deterioration in ultraviolet range.

The  PMT  recovery  at  360  nm  is  shown  in  Fig. 3.  We  estimate  that  the  recovery  time 
constant is not less than 250 hours. As R5800 PMT have reached full (>95%) recovery, we should 
conclude that applied doses do not produce irreversible damages with 60Co irradiation of 120 krad.

2.1.3 Integral change of PMT sensitivity as result of radiation damage 

For  additional  verification  of  the  results  described  above,  we  have  used  another  technique 
and  studied  change  of  PMT  sensitivity  spectra  measured  for  R5800 Hamamatsu  PMT  (#CA0641) 
after  irradiation  using  modulated  light  from  monochromator  of  luminescent  spectrometer  as  a 
source. Thus, we have measured PMT sensitivity using monochromatic light source at wavelengths 
340,  360,  380,  400,  410,  420,  430,  440,  460,  480,  500,  520,  550  and  600 nm.  Fig. 4  shows  PMT 
sensitivity  spectra  measured  one  hour  after  the  120-krad  irradiation  and  one  day  afterward 
normalized  to  the  distribution  measured  before  the  irradiation.  For  comparison,  typical  PWO 

emission  spectrum  is  also  shown.  We  can  clearly  see  that  PMT  radiation-induced  damage 
wavelength range overlaps to a great extent with the PWO emission band. 

In  order  to  estimate  the  net  effect  of  the  PMT  deterioration  on  the  PWO  scintillation light 
detection,  PMT  sensitivity  spectra  were  multiplied  by  PWO  emission  spectrum  and  then  integrals 
over the wavelength were calculated. The values of these integrals are presented in Table 2. Since a 
loss  of  30%  in  the  light  signal  is  not  acceptable  for  BTeV,  R5800  PMT  or,  generally,  a  PMT 
equipped with a borosilicate glass window cannot be used in the BTeV EMCAL.

2.2 Study of radiation damage of the PMT window materials 

 
To  find  more  suitable  PMT  window  materials  for  BTeV  applications,  we  have  tested  six 
samples  of  PMT  window  materials  with  dimensions 25.0∅×1.0 mm  sent  by  Hamamatsu 
Corporation. They were made of three different materials as listed below: 

1.  Borosilicate glass 
2.  UV glass 
3.  quartz

2 pieces;

2 pieces. 

We also included two pieces made of industrial sapphire (Al2O3) microchip substrate, which 
has been suggested to be good UV transparent PMT window material [7], in shape of parallelepiped 
with dimensions 25.0×25.0×0.4 mm3. 

120 krad tests were performed when one sample of each pair was irradiated for 15 minutes 
by  gamma-rays  from  a  60Co  source  with  non-adjustable  exposure  dose  rate  of  about  100 R/s. 
Resulting induced absorption spectra are presented in Fig. 5a-d. For comparison, typical radiation-
induced absorption spectrum of CMS-type PWO crystal at the same irradiation conditions is shown 
in Fig. 6. 

Recovery  of  radiation-induced  absorption  was  measured  for  Borosilicate  and  UV  glasses. 
Results drawn for 460 nm (that is the wavelength of the LED-based reference light source recently 
designed as a prototype for the BTeV EMCAL monitoring system) are presented in Fig. 7a and b.

Finally,  to  compare  with  our  results,  data  from  the  Hamamatsu  Handbook  [8]  have  been 
used  to  calculate  the  induced  absorption  vs.  exposure  dose.  These  results  are  displayed  in  Fig. 8. 
Extrapolating this curve to small exposure doses, we estimate that the radiation-induced absorption 
in  this  material  is  about  50 m-1  at  104 R  exposure  dose  which  is  consistent  with  what  we  observe 
with our Borosilicate glass window sample from Hamamatsu.

From these observations, we conclude that: 

•  The Borosilicate glass windows have significant damages (induced absorption of ~90 m-1 

at 420 nm) after 120 krad (~103 Gy) gamma-irradiation; 

 

 

•  The  UV glass  windows’  damages  are  about  10 times  lower  than  that  of  the  Borosilicate 
glass under the same irradiation conditions, but remain still significantly larger (~8 m-1 at 
420 nm) than typical PWO radiation damage (~0.2 m-1 at 420 nm); 

•  Sapphire sample damage have the same order of magnitude as that of the UV glass; 
•  No observable damages of the quartz sample were detected; 
•  The glass samples have slow (days) recovery after irradiation. 

We  also  tested  these  samples  using  a  lower  and  adjustable  intensity  137Cs  source 

(E=0.662 MeV). The total dose was 1 krad. 

Only  two  kinds  of  window  materials  were  chosen  for  these  low  dose  tests,  namely 
Borosilicate  and  UV  glasses,  since  the  quartz  window  did  not  show  any  deterioration  in  the  high 
dose  tests.  The  results  are  presented  in  Figs. 9a  and  b  and  displayed  in  Table  3  together  with 
previous results.

As one can see, the rate of damage generation in the Borosilicate glass is much higher than 

that of the UV glass.

3. Conclusions 
Comparative  tests  on  gamma-irradiation  of  industrial  photo-multipliers  and  various  PMT 
 
window  materials  confirmed  our  assumption  that  in  the  relevant  range  of  doses  and  dose  rates, 
degradation  of  PMT  sensitivity  for  PWO  scintillation  light  depends  only  on  PMT  window 
transmission loss in UV range. 
Negligible  damage  of  the  window  optical  transmission  is  observed  in  red  range  of  visible 
 
light spectrum. Therefore, it can be used for additional and separate monitoring of readout stability 
of BTeV EMCAL PMT-based detector unit. 

Taking into account radiation environment inside the BTeV calorimeter we may recommend 
considering a usage of PMT with quartz windows at least in its central part. On the other hand, it is 
very likely to use less expensive PMT equipped by UV glass windows in the periphery where the 
radiation levels are significantly lower. 

Our  results  are  similar  to  the  studies  of  vacuum  photo-triodes  for  the  CMS  end-caps  [9], 

even though much higher doses and dose rates were used for the latter. 

Finally,  we  must  also  mention  again  that  our  research  was  performed  using  gamma-ray 
sources, so the results are somewhat indirect. As before, it is important to understand PMT radiation 
hardness in fields of ionizing radiation produced by hadrons behind PWO crystals, which work as a 
radiation converter.

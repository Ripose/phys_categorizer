It was demonstrated that low pressure (~ 0.2 Torr) water vapor plasmas generated 

in a 10 mm inner diameter quartz tube with an Evenson microwave cavity show at 

least two features which are not explained by conventional plasma models.  First, 

significant (> 2.5 Å) hydrogen Balmer α line broadening, of constant width, up to 

5 cm from the microwave coupler was recorded.  Only hydrogen, and not oxygen, 

showed  significant  line  broadening.    This  feature,  observed  previously  in 

hydrogen-containing  mixed  gas  plasmas  generated  with  high  voltage  dc  and  rf 

discharges  was  explained  by  some  researchers  to  result  from  acceleration  of 

hydrogen  ions  near  the  cathode.    This  explanation  cannot  apply  to  the  line 

broadening  observed  in  the  (electrodeless)  microwave  plasmas  generated  in  this 

work,  particularly  at  distances  as  great  as  5  cm  from  the  microwave  coupler.  

Second,  inversion  of  the  line  intensities  of  both  the  Lyman  and  Balmer  series, 

again,  at  distances  up  to  5  cm  from  the  coupler,  were  observed.    The  line 

inversion suggests the existence of a hitherto unknown source of pumping of the 

 

1 

optical  power  in  plasmas.    Finally,  it  is  notable  that  other  aspects  of  the  plasma 

including  the  OH*  rotational  temperature  and  low  electron  concentrations  are 

quite typical of plasmas of this type.

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

About a decade ago scientists began to study the emission spectroscopy of “mixed gas” 

plasmas in detail, and these studies revealed some surprising results for those mixed gas plasmas 

in which hydrogen was one of the gases.  First, in mixtures of argon and hydrogen, the hydrogen 

emission  lines  are  significantly  broader  than  any  argon  line.1–14    Second,  many  such  plasmas 

show  a  peculiar  non-Boltzmann  population  of  the  excited  states.    Both  the  Lyman  and  the 

Balmer α lines are “overpopulated.”8,10,11,15,16 

 

We recently reported a new and related phenomenon for mixed gas plasmas containing 

hydrogen:    Preferential  hydrogen  line  broadening,  often  extreme,  was  found  in  a  number  of 

mixed  gas  discharge  plasmas.    Specifically,  it  has  been  reported  that  in  several  mixed  gas 

systems Balmer α lines broader than 2.5 Å were created in He/H2 (10%) and Ar/H2 (10%) as well 

as  plasmas  containing  volatilized  Sr  such  as  Sr/H2,  Sr/Ar/H2  (10%)  and  Sr/He/H2  (10%) 

plasmas.8,9,11,13,14  In none of these plasmas was there any significant broadening of the noble gas 

lines.  Furthermore, hydrogen lines were not broadened in a number of other mixed gas plasmas 

including Xe/H2 (10%), and Kr/H2 (10%).  These results show that the presence of hydrogen line 

broadening in mixed gas plasmas is not limited to Ar/H2, and they also suggest, consistent with 

the Mills’ model of atomic hydrogen,11,17–23 that only very special and predictable systems will 

show this broadening.  

 

Related  work,19–23  shows  there  are  other  unique  spectral  features  to  those  mixed  gas 

plasmas  containing  hydrogen  in  which  selective  hydrogen  line  broadening  is  found.  

Specifically, unique vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) emission lines are found at wavelengths precisely 

predicted  by  a  new  theory  (outlined  in  numerous  publication  including  reference  19–23).  

Specifically strong lines were found at wavelengths corresponding to energies of q*13.6 where 

q=1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,11.  These strong emissions are not found in any single gas plasma, and cannot 

3 

be assigned to the known emission of any of the single gases studied.  These lines are only found 

in mixed gas plasmas, called resonance transfer (RT) plasmas.  Indeed, those mixed gas plasmas 

(e.g.  Kr/H2  and  Xe/H2)  that  do  not  produce  line  broadening,  also  do  not  produce  any  special 

“mixed gas plasma” lines in the VUV.19–23 

In  the  present  paper  we  report  some  remarkable  features  of  a  water  vapor  (mixed  gas) 

plasma  generated  using  an  Evenson  microwave  cavity.    (As  both  oxygen  and  hydrogen  are 

quickly  evolved  in  the  plasma  this  can  be  considered  a  “mixed  gas”  plasma  containing 

hydrogen.)  First, it was found that low pressure (<1 Torr) water vapor plasmas generated with 

the  Evenson  microwave  cavity,  have  preferential  hydrogen  line  broadening  similar  to  that 

described  in  earlier  reports  on  the  mixed  gas  plasmas.    Second,  line  broadening  is  found  to 

persist, undiminished, up to 5 cm from the coupler.  In addition, evidence of strong pumping to 

cause population inversion is presented.  At distances up to several centimeters from the cavity, 

inversion  (negative  temperatures  in  a  Boltzmann  distribution)  were  recorded  for  the  Balmer 

series.  Calculations indicate that the degree of inversion observed may require as much as 200 

W · cm–3 pumping power in at least a limited volume of the plasma.24,25  At a microwave input 

power  of  9  W  ·  cm–3,  a  collisional  radiative  model  showed  that  the  hydrogen  excited  state 

population distribution was consistent with an n = 1→5,6  pumping power of 200 W · cm–3, a far 

higher  pumping  power  density  than  that  found  in  existing  laser  systems.    Yet,  other 

measurements  show  quite  ordinary  features.    For  example,  the  rotation  temperature  profile 

determined  from  OH*  species  was  not  unusual  in  any  aspect.    The  concentration  of  charged 

species was found to be very low.  It is also notable that there was no evidence of pumping or 

line broadening when a radio frequency coil replaced the microwave coupler on our system.

II. EXPERIMENTAL 

 

The plasma reactors employed in this work were simple quartz tubes, 1 cm diameter by 

20 cm in length.  All of the visible spectroscopy was collected with the cell in the configuration 

shown  Fig.  1.    The  microwave  cavity  used  was  an  E-mode26,27  co-axial  Evenson  cavity 

microwave  (Opthos  Model  #B1,  powered  with  2.45  GHz  Opthos  MPG–4M  generator)  which 

only  “covers”  a  section  of  the  reactor  about  2.5  cm  in  length.    For  all  microwave  studies  net 

input power was maintained at 90 W.  Reflected power was kept to less than 5 W.  For the 0.2 

Torr    operation  mass  loss  studies  showed  the  flow  rate  of  water  vapor  to  be  approximately  1 

sccm. 

 

For the rf plasma study, the only change was that the microwave cavity was removed and 

replaced with a coil, about 10 cm in total length, wrapped around the central section of the tube.   

The  rf  coil  was  powered  from  a  13.56  MHz  generator  (RF  VII,  Inc.,  Model  MN  500)  with  a 

matching  network  (RF  Power  Products,  Inc.,  Model  RF  5S,  300  W).    The  coil  inductance  and 

resistance were 4.7 µH and 0.106 Ω, respectively.  The coil impedance was 400 Ω at 13.56 MHz.   

The forward rf power was 90 W, and the reflected power was less than 1 W.  The gas flow rates  

and pressure were 1 sccm and 0.2 Torr, respectively. 

 

For the VUV study of a water plasma, a similar quartz tube was employed with the same 

Evenson cavity, but the tube end opposite the water source was opened to the VUV spectrometer 

through a pin-hole collimator.  This configuration was employed as UV “transparent” optics do 

not exist.  Using differential pumping (more detail, reference 19) it was possible to operate the 

water plasma for the VUV study at 0.2 Torr, while the spectrometer itself was operated at about 

10-6 Torr.   

 

The high resolution visible spectrometer (scanned between 4000–7000 Å using a 0.05 Å 

step  size)  was  a  Jobin  Yvon  Horiba  1250  M  with  2400  groves/mm  ion-etched  holographic 

5 

diffraction  grating  with  a  resolution  of  ±  0.06  Å  over  the  spectral  range  1900–8600  Å.    The 

entrance  and  exit  slits  were  set  to  20  µm.    The  signal  was  recorded  by  a  photomultiplier  tube 

(PMT) with a stand alone high voltage power supply (950 V) and an acquisition controller.  The 

data  was  obtained  in  a  single  accumulation  with  a  1  second  integration  time.    The  plasma 

emission  was  fiber-optically  coupled  through  a  220F  matching  fiber  adapter  positioned  2  cm 

from the cell wall to the spectrometer.  Using this geometry, we were able to show with a red 

laser  that  light  was  collected  from  a  source  length  in  the  cell  of  no  greater  than  2  mm.    Thus, 

there was no “overlap” in the “light source” for each of the data points collected.  

 

The response of this spectrometer was shown to be approximately flat in the 4000–7000 

Å  region  with  an  intensity  calibrated  tungsten  lamp.    To  measure  the  absolute  intensity,  the 

spectrometer  and  detection  system  were  calibrated28  with  5460.8  Å,  5769.6  Å,  and  6965.4  Å 

light from a Hg–Ar lamp (Ocean Optics, model HG-1) that was calibrated with a NIST certified 

silicon  photodiode.    The  population  density  of  the  n = 3  hydrogen  excited  state  N3  was 

determined  from  the  absolute  intensity  of  the  Balmer  α  (6562.8  Å)  line  measured  using  the 

calibrated spectrometer.  In turn, the absolute intensities of n = 4 to 9 were determined from the 

ratio of each of these lines to that of the absolute intensity Balmer α (

3=n

).  Additional detail 

on this spectrometer and its operation are given elsewhere.9,24,25 

 

The  VUV  spectrometer  (20–5600Å)  was  a  normal  incidence  0.2  meter  monochromator 

equipped  with  a  1200  lines/mm  holographic  grating  with  a  platinum  coating.    The  VUV 

spectrum  was  recorded  with  a  channel  electron  multiplier  (CEM).    The  wavelength  resolution 

was about  0.2  Å full width half maximum (FWHM) with slit widths of 50 µm.  The increment 

was  2  Å  and  the  dwell  time  was  500  ms.    The  VUV  spectra  (900–1300  Å)  of  the  water  and 

control hydrogen plasmas were recorded at 90 W input power. 

 

The  spectrometer  was  calibrated  between  400–2000  Å  with  a  standard  discharge  light 

6 

source  using  He,  Ne,  Ar,  Kr,  and  Xe  lines:  He  I  (584  Å),  He  II  (304  Å),  Ne  I  (735  Å),  Ne  II 

(460.7 Å), Ar I (1048 Å), Ar II (932 Å), Kr II (964 Å), Xe I (1295.6 Å), Xe II (1041.3 Å), Xe II 

(1100.43  Å).    The  wavelength  and  intensity  ratios  matched  those  given  by  NIST.29    The 

spectrometer response was determined to be approximately flat in the 1000–1300 Å region.  

Measurements (upper bound) of the electron density and temperature of the water plasma 

were  determined  using  a  compensated  Langmuir  probe  according  to  the  method  given 

 

 

 

previously.30 

 

III. RESULTS 

In  order  to  definitively  demonstrate  the  unique  behavior  of  water  vapor  plasmas 

generated  with  an  Evenson  cavity,  we  thoroughly  characterized  both  an  Evenson  cavity 

microwave  plasma  and  an  rf  plasma  maintained  in  the  exact  same  tube  operated  at  the  same 

pressure and approximate flow rate.  As the following data shows, the Evenson cavity generated 

plasma  showed  remarkable  features,  including  excessive  hydrogen  atom  line  broadening  and 

excited  state  population  inversion;  whereas,  the  spectroscopic  study  of  the  rf  plasma  indicated 

conventional behavior with no inversion.  Comparing these results allows us to demonstrate that 

our  measurement  technique  is  sound  and  that  we  were  able  to  measure  features  with  high 

fidelity.  

 

For  water  vapor  plasmas,  the  following  parameters  were  measured  as  a  function  of 

distance from the center of the microwave coupler: (i) the hydrogen Balmer α line width, (ii) the 

gas temperature determined using OH* rotation, (iii) line intensities expressing the excited state 

population inversion, and (iv) tube surface temperature profiles measured with a series of type-K 

thermocouples.  An attempt was made to directly measure and spatially map the electron density 

in the microwave plasma using a Langmuir probe.  However, the recorded signals were below

-3

. 

 

The  rotational  temperature  profile  (based  on  the  population  of  OH*  levels),  of  the 

microwave and rf plasmas are shown in Fig. 2.  It is clear that the rotational temperature profile 

(Fig. 2) is qualitatively similar for all the plasmas and is similar to that of any single gas plasma.  

The gas temperature profile, determined from the OH* band using the Boltzmann plot method as 

described  in  detail  elsewhere,31  declines  with  distance  from  the  plasma  coupler.    Also,  the 

temperatures  are  clearly  in  the  range  anticipated  given  the  results  of  earlier  studies  of  gas 

temperatures in microwave plasmas31–35 over a range of operating conditions.  

 

In  sharp  contrast  to  the  “standard”  behavior  of  rotation  temperature  profiles,  is  the 

observation  that  there  is  an  inversion  of  the  excitation  state  populations.    Indeed,  the  relative 

intensities  of  the  Balmer  series  of  lines  fitted  using  the  standard  Boltzmann  approach  yield 

“negative  temperatures.”    The  generation  of  a  non-Boltzmann  distribution  of  electron 

populations  in  a  gas  or  solid  system  results  from  some  mechanism  of  pumping.36,37    As  noted 

later  for  inversion  and  excessive  H  line  broadening  as  well,  it  cannot  simply  reflect  energy 

transfer from hot electrons.  Thus, this finding implies that there is some form of energy transfer 

in this “mixed gas” plasma that cannot be ascribed to the standard model of microwave plasmas 

whereby electrons acquire electric field energy and transfer it to ions and neutrals only thorough 

collisions.    Furthermore,  inversion  is  observed  at  distances  as  great  as  5  cm  from  the  coupler.  

The relative intensity spectra collected in several cases are shown in Fig. 3, and plots of relative 

line intensities for these “inverted” populations are shown in Fig. 4.  

 

The measured hydrogen line broadening as a function of position is shown in Fig. 5 as 

FWHM of the Hα (6562.8 Å) line versus distance along the tube reactor from the zero position at 

the  center  of  the  Evenson  cavity.    Once  again,  it  was  found  that  in  a  mixed  plasma  only  the 

hydrogen  line  is  broadened,  and  it  is  broadened  significantly.    A  new  finding  is  that  the  line 

8 

broadening is axially uniform in the plasma tube up to 5 cm from the coupler rather than rapidly 

diminishing with distance from the power source as in the case with excessively broadened H in 

Ar/H2  rf  and  glow  discharges.1–7  This  new  finding  is  also  not  consistent  with  any  model  that 

attributes selective line broadening to either a field (extremely low outside the coupler region) or 

high electron densities (very low in this region).   

It  should  also  be  noted  that  at  distances  greater  than  about  5  cm  beyond  the  coupler 

neither  inversion  nor  line  broadening  was  observed.    Even  at  this  position,  the  relative  line 

intensities were not in proportion to that expected from a thermal or Boltzmann distribution as 

the Balmer β state was overpopulated. 

We were also able to collect limited data regarding the Lyman series of lines using the 

VUV  spectrometer  tuned  to  shorter  wavelengths.    Unfortunately,  this  system  is  not  readily 

adaptable for mapping the plasma as a function of position.  Only a “global” spectrum, that is a 

sampling of light from the entire plasma, is possible (Fig. 6).  Still, it is clear in the figure that for 

the plasma as a whole, the excited state population inversion impacts the Lyman series as well. 

This  provides  a  verification  that  a  source  of pumping impacts the hydrogen atom excited state 

The  truly  unique  nature  of  the  0.2  Torr  water  vapor  plasma  created  with  the  Evenson 

cavity  can  best  be  understood  by  comparison  with  other  plasmas.    For  example,  running  the 

system at a slightly higher pressure reduced the extent of the inversion significantly.  As shown 

in  Figs.  3  and  4,  the  inversion  extended  less  than  3  cm  from  the  microwave  coupler  at  this 

populations.  

pressure.  

Another comparison was made using the same system (quartz tube, water supply, pump), 

but  replacing  the  Evenson  cavity  with  an  rf  coil.  This generated a discharge with none of the 

unique  features  of  the  microwave  plasma.    That  is,  as  shown,  for  an  rf  source  run  with 

 

 

 

 

9 

approximately  the  same  power  as  the  Evenson  cavity  there  is  no  excited  state  population 

inversion (Figs. 3 and 4), or line broadening (Fig. 5).  Yet, the rotation temperature profile of the 

two  plasmas  is  very  similar  (Fig.  2).    Figure  4  provides  a  direct  comparison  of  the  relative 

populations  of  excited  states  for  the  two  systems.    Clearly  for  the  rf  plasma  the  states  are 

populated  as  anticipated  for  a  Boltzmann  distribution;  whereas,  the  Evenson  cavity  excited 

population is “exceptional.”  That is, the Evenson cavity results indicate a source of pumping; 

whereas, there is no pumping for the rf system.   

One additional observation of importance to evaluating the model of Mills ('RT plasma', 

references 19–23) for providing the high energies required for the selective line broadening is the 

existence of significant quantities of O2+ at 3715.0 Å, 3754.8 Å, and 3791.28 Å as shown in Fig. 

7. Again, these lines, like all non H-atom lines in the microwave generated water plasma, show 

 

 

 

no broadening. 

IV.  DISCUSSION 

Consistent with earlier work, the data collected for this study clearly show that in “mixed 

gas”  plasmas  containing  hydrogen,  the  hydrogen  lines  are  extraordinary  broadened,  indicating 

that hydrogen atoms are 10–100 times more energetic than other molecular and atomic species 

present.    In  addition,  we  report  a  unique  feature  of  one  particular  low  pressure,  hydrogen 

containing  mixed  gas  plasma.    Specifically,  low  pressure  (~ 0.2  Torr)  water  vapor  plasmas 

generated with an Evenson cavity show a significant inversion of excited state populations.  In 

contrast, a water vapor rf plasma created with the same nominal input power, the same tube, and 

at the same pressure, showed no unusual features.  Indeed, not even broadening of the hydrogen 

lines was observed.  Moreover; both plasmas showed “expected” behavior in terms of rotation 

temperature  and  very  low  electron  densities.    This  data  alone  pose  some  puzzling  questions.  

10 

What  plasma  mechanism  could  provide  the  significant  power  density  required  to  “pump” 

electrons into the non-thermal distribution of excited states?  Why are the unusual features only 

found for the Evenson cavity plasma? 

We  have  assumed  that  Doppler  broadening  due  to  thermal  motion  was  the  dominant 

source to the extent that other sources may be neglected.  This assumption was confirmed when 

each  source  was  considered.    In  general,  the  experimental  profile  is  a  convolution  of  two 

Doppler  profiles,  an  instrumental  profile,  the  natural  (lifetime)  profile,  Stark  profiles,  van  der 

Waals profiles, a resonance profile, and fine structure.  The contribution from each source was 

determined to be below the limit of detection.8,9,14  This same conclusion was reached by other 

workers detecting  selective H-atom line broadening in mixed gas plasmas.1–14 

 

Mapping a number of characteristics of the plasma as a function of linear distance from 

the  microwave  coupler  raises  additional  questions.    First,  the  finding  that  the  line  broadening 

persists, undiminished, up to 5 cm from the coupler, provides evidence that earlier models of the 

line  broadening  mechanism  do  not  apply  to  this  system.    In  those  models  hydrogen  line 

broadening  is  attributed  to  hydrogen  ion  acceleration  by  a  static  electric  field.    In  the  present 

system, there can be no acceleration in the region outside the cavity region as there is no field.  

Also,  there  is  no  known  mechanism  for  significant  ion  acceleration  in  a  microwave  field, 

indicating there is no mechanism of field acceleration in the cavity.  Moreover, even if there was 

a  hitherto  unknown  process  of  direct  ion  acceleration  in  the  cavity,  this  effect  should  be 

dramatically  diminished  by  collisions  long  before  an  ion  travels  5  cm.    Indeed,  the  mean  free 

path  for  “hard  sphere”  collisions  is  less  than  about  1  mm  for  this  system.    Yet,  experimental 

measures clearly show no change in line shape even 5 cm from the coupler.   

Furthermore,  only  the  electrons  respond  to  the  microwave  field  rather  than  hydrogen 

species,    H+,

+
2H , 

+

3H ,  H–,  H,  or  H2.    But,  the  measured  electron  temperature  was  about  1  eV; 

11 

whereas, the measured H temperature was 50 eV.  This requires that TH >>>Te.  This result also 

can not be explained by electric field acceleration of charged species.  Nor can it be explained by 

electron or external Stark broadening.  The electron density of about 108 cm–3 was five orders of 

magnitude too low.8,9,14  And, in microwave driven plasmas, there is no high electric field in a 

cathode fall region (> 1 kV/cm) to accelerate positive ions as proposed previously1–7 to explain 

significant  broadening  in  hydrogen  containing  plasmas  driven  at  a  high  voltage  electrodes.  

Thus, it is impossible for H or any H-containing ion which may give rise to H to have a higher 

temperature than the electrons in a microwave plasma. 

 

In sum, conventional arguments would suggest that the excess energy responsible for the 

observed  hydrogen  line  broadening  would  be  dissipated  through  collisions  within  a  couple  of 

millimeters  of  its  “generation.”    Since  the  lifetimes  of  H  (n  =  2)  and  H  (n  =  3)  are  each 

approximately 10-8 s and the average velocity of the fastest hydrogen atoms was <105 m/s, the 

excitation  must  have  been  local.5    In  turn,  this  indicates  that  the  process  creating  the  line 

broadening is not restricted to the coupler zone, and thus must be occurring under conditions not 

dependent on direct input of microwave power. 

 

Another  difficulty  for  conventional  theory  is  to  explain  the  relationship  between  the  H 

line broadening and non-Boltzmann populations of the excited states.  Hydrogen line broadening 

is  unique  to  certain  plasmas  such  as  argon  and  helium  plasmas  mixed  with  hydrogen8,9,11–14  as 

well as water vapor plasmas.  Inversion is unique to water plasmas, but H line intensity profile 

anomalies are also observed for the former plasmas as well.  Mills et al. reported previously8 that 

upon  the  addition  of  5%  argon  to  a  hydrogen  microwave  plasma,  the  Lyman  α  emission  was 

observed to increase by about an order of magnitude; whereas, xenon control had no effect.  A 

similar  result  was  obtained  in  the  case  of  hollow-cathode hydrogen glow discharge plasmas to 

which 5% argon or helium was added.10,11  Anomalous Ar/H2 plasmas were observed by other 

12 

researchers.  Fozza et. al.15 recorded the EUV spectrum of a H2 microwave plasma and observed 

that  the  ratio  of  the  intensity  of  the  Lyman  α  emission  to  the  molecular  hydrogen  emission 

(Lyman

)  was  about  two  orders  of  magnitude  in  the  case  of  gas  flow  ratio  of  

φH2/Ar : φAr =  1 : 14  versus  the  pure  hydrogen  plasma  at  twice  the  input  power.    Furthermore, 

Fujimoto  et  al.38  have  determined  the  cross  section  for  production  of  excited  hydrogen  atoms 

from  the  emission  cross  sections  for  Lyman  and  Balmer  lines  when  molecular  hydrogen  is 

dissociated  into  excited  atoms  by  electron  collisions.    This  data  was  used  to  develop  a 

collisional-radiative model to be used in determining the ratio of molecular-to-atomic hydrogen 

densities in tokomak plasmas.  Their results indicate an excitation threshold of 17 eV for Lyman 

α  emission.    Addition  of  other  gases  would  be  expected  to  decrease  the  intensity  of  hydrogen 

lines  which  could  be  absorbed  by  the  gas.    Hollander  and  Wertheimer16  found  that  within  a 

selected  range  of  parameters,  a  helium-hydrogen  microwave  plasma  emits  a  very  intense 

hydrogen Lyman α radiation at 1215 Å which is up to 40 times more intense than other lines in 

the  spectrum.    The  Lyman  α  emission  intensity  showed  a  significant  deviation  from  that 

predicted  by  the  model  of  Fujimoto  et  al.38  and  from  the  emission  of  hydrogen  alone.    An 

internal source of free energy could explain the line broadening and non-Boltzmann populations 

of the excited states observed previously,8–14 and further studies with controls19–23 could confirm 

the source in independent studies.15,16 

The conditions of an extraordinarily high H Doppler temperature, a negative H excitation 

temperature,  and  cold  electron,  excitation,  and  rotational  temperatures  measured  on  OH*  is 

impossible to explain with collisional-radiative, coronal, or Saha-Boltzmann models.39   We did 

an exhaustive search for a possible conventional mechanism that was consistent with all of the 

results.  Whatever explanation is adopted, it should explain several phenomena simultaneously.  

Particularly, the mechanism must account for the extraordinary line broadening up to 6 cm from 

13 

the  coupler  in  a  region  devoid  of  electrons  and  must  simultaneously  explain  the  inversion  of 

excited  state  populations.    It  should  further  explain  why  these  phenomena  are  plasma-source 

dependent  (i.e.  why  the  phenomena  occur  in  an  Evenson  microwave  plasma,  but  not  in  an 

inductively  coupled  rf  plasma  maintained  in  the  same  plasma  cell).    Not  one  of  the  unique 

features  of  the  observed  H-atom  spectra  could  be  independently  explained  satisfactorily  using 

standard models.  The Frank–Condon effect (FCE) was even considered.  This effect creates H 

with energies of about 2 eV by wall recombination reactions of the type40,41

In  our  experiments,  Evenson  microwave  water  plasmas  were  used  as  sources  of  O,  O2 

and  atomic  hydrogen.    As  only  the  Evenson  cavity  appears  to  generate  the  unique  phenomena 

observed  here,  this  suggests  a  linkage  with  the  special  characteristics  of  plasmas  created  with 

this device.  Earlier literature indicates that the charge species concentration in such a plasma is 

quite  low.8,9,14,24    That  was  observed  in  this  system  as  well.    Moreover,  the  concentration  of 

species such as H, O, and O2 are expected to be very high.  The latter condition is required for 

the  Mills’  model  of  unique  “reactions”  involving  hydrogen  and  various  catalytic  species  (O-

atoms  and  molecules  in  this  system),  a  model  which  also  postulates  that  line  broadening 

processes are not strong “field” related, and hence not restricted to the coupler region.  In this 

case,  the  pumping  power  source  giving  rise  to  inversion  is  the  same  as  the  broadening  power 

source.24,25,42,43   

V. CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, there is a growing body of evidence that mixed gas plasmas of particular 

compositions produce emission spectra that cannot be readily explained by any classical model 

14 

 
 

 

 

 

of  plasmas.    That  is,  there  is  now  a  set  of  observations  for  mixed  gas  plasmas,  some  made  in 

multiple labs, including extreme line broadening of only one species (H), the demonstration of 

pumping of population inversion in H, and the repeated discovery of unique spectral lines in the 

VUV  region  whose  energies  are  integer-squared  those  of  the  energies  of  H,  which  challenge 

traditional theory. Finally, it must be noted that the evidence is consistent with a novel energy 

transfer mechanism.

FIG.  1:    Schematic  of  the  Water  Plasma  System.    Note,  the  only  modification  made  for  the  rf 

study  was  the  replacement  of  the  Evenson  microwave  applicator  and  generator  with  an  rf  coil 

FIG. 2:  Gas Temperature Profiles.  Rotational temperature (TR) as a function of distance along 

the  tube  reactor  from  the  zero  position  at  the  center  of  the  Evenson  cavity  for  three  water 

plasmas.  The Evenson cavity was operated at 0.2 Torr (a), and 1 Torr (b), and the rf system was 

operated at 0.2 Torr (c). 

FIG. 3:  Excited State Population Inversion.  The visible emission spectrum (2700–7200 Å) from 

an Evenson water plasma operated at 0.2 Torr clearly shows excited state population inversion of 

the hydrogen atoms at 1 cm (a) and 5 cm (b) from the coupler, as well as at all points in between.  

Only  at  7  cm  from  the  coupler  (c)  is  the  population  of  the  excited  states  in  the  expected 

proportion for a thermal plasma.  The Evenson cavity operated at 1 Torr pressure doesn’t show 

inversion at 4 cm (d) from the cavity, but does at 1 cm (e).  In contrast, the rf plasma generated at 

0.2 Torr doesn’t show inversion at any position including 1 cm (f) and 5 cm (g) from the center.   

FIG. 4:  Relative Balmer Series Intensities.  The relative intensities of Balmer series transitions 

 where 

nI  is the absolute intensity of level  n ,  A  is the Einstein coefficient, and  g  is 

the statistical weight given by  2n2 ) collected at 1 cm from the coupler center are shown for the 

Evenson cavity plasma operated at 0.2 Torr (a), 1.0 Torr (b), and for the rf plasma operated at 0.2

FIG. 5:  Line Broadening Profiles.  The extraordinary line width for the H Balmer α line (6562.8 

Å)  emitted  from  the  water  plasma  was  found  to  vary  little  as  a  function  of  position  from  the 

19 

center of the Evenson cavity operated at 0.2 Torr (a) and 1.0 Torr (b).  Very little line broadening 

was found for the rf water plasma operated at 0.2 Torr (c).  No line broadening was found for the 

oxygen radical (3971 Å) line for either the Evenson (d) or rf (e) water plasmas operated at 0.2 

Torr.   

FIG.  6:    Lyman  Series  Populations.  A VUV spectroscopic study of the Lyman series in a 0.2 

Torr  water  plasma  generated  with  an  Evenson  cavity  clearly  shows  the  impact  of  population 

inversion  of  the  excited  states  on  the  relative  intensities  of  the  lines  (a).    In  contrast,  a  pure 

hydrogen plasma at the same pressure shows no inversion (b). 

FIG.  7:  O  (III)  Emission.    The  visible  spectrum  (3700–3960  Å)  of  the  cell  emission  from  a 

water microwave plasma with 90 W input power.  The catalysis mechanism was supported by 

the observation of O2+ at 3715.0 Å, 3754.8 Å, and 3791.28 Å.  O+ was observed at 3727.2 Å, 

3749.4  Å,  3771  Å,  3872  Å,  and  3946.3  Å.    The  hydrogen  Balmer  lines  corresponding  to  the 

transitions 10-2, 9-2, and 8-2 were also observed.

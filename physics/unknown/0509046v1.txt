ABSTRACT 

By applying the Heisenberg’s  uncertainty principle for a macroscopic quantum gas formed 

by gravitational waves an expression for the universal bound on  the entropy proposed by 

Bekenstein for any system of maximum radius R and total energy E has been obtained.  By 

using such expression, in the theoretical scheme of the crystalline vacuum cosmic model, 
the  low  entropy  value  at  the  Big  Bang  beginning,  1088k,  is  explained.  According  to  our 

analysis  the  time  arrow  is  well  defined  and  the  theoretical  time  flow  occurs  only  in  one 

direction as requested by the physical processes of gravitational stabilization of the vacuum 

space crystalline structure around equilibrium conditions.

I. 

INTRODUCTION 

In 1981, Bekenstein [1] proposed the existence of a universal bound on the entropy S of any 

object or system of maximum radius R and total energy E,

(1) 

Where 

k,η

and  c  have  the  usual  meaning.    According  to  Bekenstein  [2],  this  bound  was 

inferred from the requirement that the generalized second law of thermodynamics for black 

hole [3 -6 ] be respected when a box containing entropy is deposited with no radial motion 

next  to  the  horizon  of  a  Schuarzchild  black  hole,  and  then  allowed  to  fall  in.    The  box’s 

entropy  disappears  but  an  increase  in  the  black  hole  entropy  occurs.    The  second  law  is 

respected provide S is bounded as in Eq. (1).  An analytical proof of the bound has been 

obtained  by  Schiffer  and  Bekenstein  [7]  for  some  generic  system  consisting  of  a  non 

interacting  quantum  field  in  three  dimensions  confined  to  a  cavity  of  arbitrary  shape  and 

topology. 

The  main  goal  of  this  paper  is  twofold.    First,  to  obtain  an  expression  similar  to  Eq.  (1) 

starting  from  the  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle.  And  second,  to  apply  the  obtained 

equation for the crystalline vacuum cosmic space model to describe the change in entropy 

before and after the matter packages formation occurring in the early Universe.

2.  THEORY 

used in our analysis. 

For  the  sake  of  making  this  paper  self  contained,  let  us  make  a  brief  synthesis  of  some 

previous results obtained from the crystalline vacuum cosmic model [8 - 11] which will be 

From  the  gravitational  stability  analysis  of  a  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  [9],  with 

lattice  parameter  of  the  order  of  the  neutron  radius,  an  expression  which  describes  the 

adiabatic  compression  of  the  original  gravitational  waves  for  the  gravitational  stability  of 

crystalline vacuum cosmic space has been obtained, namely

and T(r) as the gravitational wave temperature with concentric radius r.  In this scheme ROU 
encloses 10120 physical lattice points, and the gravitational stabilization of such crystalline 
region  is  obtained  by  forming  1080  baryons  (in  particular  neutrons)  starting  from  10120 

original  gravitational  stabilization  waves  each  one  described  by  Eq.  (3),  [9].    In  other 

words,  the  collective  long  -  range  quantum  fluctuation  which  stabilizes  the  vacuum 

crystalline  structure  against  gravitational  instabilities  has  an  energy  density,  Uqf,  of  about 
10-40 times the energy density of the crystalline vacuum structure, UVS, [9, 11].  In terms of 

internal energy of the crystalline structure of the vacuum space, EVS, the total change in the 

crystal internal energy, inside the volume

fluctuation, Eqf, is Eqf = 10-40 EVS.

Also, another important result obtained previously [9], from this adiabatic compression, by 

its  own  self  attraction,  of  the  original  gravitational  waves  for  the  stabilization  of  the 

crystalline vacuum cosmic space is,

with  Δt(r) = r/c. 

At  first  approach,  Eq.  (4)  gives  an  apparent  paradoxical  situation:    the  temperature 

measurements  of  a  system  require  a  time  interval  to  be  determined  when  equilibrium 

thermodynamics, which defines temperature, excludes time for such situation.   In our case 

by  using  similar  expressions  as  Eq.  (3)  to  describe  gravitational  transitions,  it  is  easy  to 

obtain 

ΔΕΔt

η≥

  from  Eq.  (4)  which  is  the  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle.  In  other 

words  temperature,  which  is  a  thermodynamical  concept  used  to  describe  disordered  of 

degraded energy, requires as any other form of energy a finite minimum interval of time to 

be measured in a quantum scheme 

/η≥Δ

t

kT

.  From Eq. (4) it is clear that the minimum 

time required to measure a given temperature only is measurable or important when T is a 

very low quantity, and for every day purpose it is irrelevant. 

Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle in the form, 

 

η≥ΔΔ

(5) 

where ΔP is the uncertainty in the system linear momentum and ΔX is the uncertainty in its 

position will be used to analyze a macroscopic quantum gas as follows.  Let us consider a 

macroscopic  quantum  gas  of  volume  V  on  which  a  force  is  exerted  by  an  impulsive 

interaction  given  by 

f

/

ΔΔ≡

.  Then  inequality  Eq.  (5)  could  be  written  as  

(

VAP /

η≥Δ

, where A is for area and ΔV is the change in volume.  Another way to write

the previous equation is,

where 

σ
≡Δ

.  Also it is clear that for any physical system Δσ and ΔV have opposite 

sign.  From  the  theory  of  thermodynamic  fluctuations  [12]  we  know  that,  in  our  notation, 

<Δσ ΔV> = -kT.   Therefore, Eq. (7) becomes,  

tT

/η≥Δ

k

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(8) 

where T is the absolute temperature of the quantum gas.  This result is identical to Eq. (4), 

and the theoretical way used here, enlighten their physical meaning. 

During  the  gravitational  stabilizing  process  of  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  we 

know that the collective long - range quantum fluctuations responsible for such stabilization 

change  the  internal  energy  of  the  vacuum  crystalline  space  by  a  quantity  Eqf  (inside  a 

volume VOU).  Thus by considering that the gravitational waves which cause such collective 

long  -  range  quantum  fluctuation  could  be  considered  at  first  approximation  as  a 

macroscopic quantum gas under an adiabatic process of compression due to its own self - 

attraction, it is possible to obtain an expression for the change in entropy of such a gas a 

function of the radius r, ΔS(r) as given by

easy to obtain the following expression,

(10) 

with  E = Eqf, and neglecting a factor of 2π, this equation is equal to Eq. (1) proposed by 

Bekenstein [1] 

Therefore  Eq.  (10)  could  be  applied  to  analyze  the  corresponding  situation  to  the  initial 

instability  of  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space  and  the  previous  state  where 

gravitational  waves  (from  the  gravitational  stabilization  of  the  crystalline  vacuum  space) 
becomes  1080 quanta  matters  (neutrons).   By using this equation  for  R = ROU  and  for  

R = rN, where rN is the neutron radius, together with Eq. (2) the following result is obtained 

for stabilizing gravitational waves,

where  SOU  is  the  entropy  (inside  of  a  Volume  VOU)  at  the  maximum  situation  of

to  the  limit  where  the  energy  of  each  1040  original  stabilization  gravitational  waves

this unit can be called the matter unit of gravitons. 

And by taking into account the De Broglie ondulatory scheme as used previously [9], we

The physical meaning of the last results is the following.  The decrease in entropy between 

the  thermodynamical  equilibrium  state  corresponding  to  the  greatest  gravitational 
instability on the crystalline structure of the cosmic vacuum, SOU = 10120k, and the entropy 
of  the  state  previous  to  the  formation  of  1080  matter  packages (neutrons), which is SNF 
=  1080k,  has  its  origin  in  the  ondulatory  character  of  the  gravitational  waves  which  is  a 

quantum property of the energy in the Universe. 

3.  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 

By  using  Heisenberg’s  uncertainty  principle  to  study  the  fluctuations  on  a  macroscopic 

quantum gas composed by gravitational waves, an expression proposed by Bekenstein, for 

a universal bound on the entropy, S, of any object or system of maximum radius R and total 

energy  E  has  been  obtained.    With  the  use  of  such  expression  in  the  scheme  of  the 

crystalline vacuum cosmic space some physical results has been obtained which allow us to 

give some discussion and conclusions about it. 

1  According  to  our  results,  inside  the  present  Universe  volume,  at  the  beginning  of  the 
cosmological  fluctuation  cycle  which  we  are  analyzing  10120  original  gravitational 

waves, each of one having energy 

/η=ν
h

Rc

, contribute to stabilize the crystalline 

OU

OU

structure of the vacuum cosmic space against the long - range gravitational stresses.  To 
this  original  gravitational  waves  corresponds  an  entropy  SOU  =  10120k.        During  the 

10

adiabatic  compression  process  occurring  between  these  waves  by  their  mutual 
gravitational  interaction  eventually  (before  the  Big  Bang  event  (occurred),  1080 
neutrons  are  formed.  Such  neutrons  have  total  entropy  SNF  of  1080k.      Also  we  know 

from reference [9] that the diminishing in the gravitational energy of the fundamental 

gravitational waves, which stabilizes the vacuum cosmic structure, when an a adiabatic 

self-compression  process  occur  between  these  waves  from  radius  ROU  to  the  radius 
which  envelopes  the  1080  neutrons  formed  at  the  end  of  the  contraction  phase  is  the 

required  energy  source  which  produces  an  electromagnetic  radiation  field  with  total 
energy of 105Eou. This energy gives entropy of 105k per baryon. There according to our 
theoretical scheme the starting entropy at the beginning of the big bang is 1085k.  This 

value is close enough to the total entropy at the big bang an estimated by Penrose [15].  

Then the decrease in entropy during this part of the gravitational stabilization cycle on 

the crystalline structure of the vacuum cosmic space is due to the quantum properties of 

the gravitational waves. 

The  radiation  energy  required  for  the  expansion  cycle  will  be  analyzed  in  a  future 

paper.  This is because here our main interest is to explore the entropy implications of 

our model.  It is possible that the energy yield from the transformation process of one 

quarter of the original baryon matter, neutrons, into helium (about one percent of EOU) 
contribute  to  increase  the  Universe  entropy  in  a  significant  way;  108  photons  per 

baryon  as  considered  by  Hoyle,  Burbidge  and  Norlikar  [14]  but  their  analysis  is  a 

controversial  one  and  do  not  gives  a  physical  explanation  for  the  dynamics  of  the 

expansion  cycle.    And  also  our  result  for  the  entropy  before  the  beginning  of  the 

adiabatic  compression  process,  between  gravitational  waves  for  the  gravitational 
stabilizing  of  the  crystalline  vacuum  cosmic  space,  namely    10120k  is  in  close 
agreement  with  the  final  entropy  for  the  Universe  considered  a  closed  one  10123k.  

These  last  results  have  been  obtained  by  using  the  Bekenstein  -  Hawking  formula  as 

though the whole Universe had formed a black hole [16]. 

 

 

 

 

 

11

      At this point, we do not need to worry about the full thermodynamical implications of 

our  analysis  because  we  are  facing  a  fluctuation  process  of  the  long  -  range 

gravitational  stresses  on  the  crystalline  structure  of  the  vacuum  cosmic  space  around 

zero  gravitational  stresses.  Consider  for  instance  that  the  total  change  in  the  internal 

energy of the crystalline structure due to the long - range quantum fluctuations is about 
10-40  the  internal  energy  of  the  perfect  crystalline  structure  of  the  cosmic  vacuum.   

And, also we know that the entropy of a closed thermodynamical system can decrease 

spontaneously as a result of statistical fluctuations [4]. 

2)  In  our  scheme  ([9,  10,  11]  and  this  paper),  the  arrow  of  time  is  well  defined  and  the 

flow  of  theoretical  time  occurs  only  in  one  direction  as  requested  by  the  physical 

process of gravitational stabilization of the crystalline vacuum cosmic space.  This flow 

of  time  is  in  agreement  to  our  physiological  and  physicological  sensation  of  the 

progression of time in the daily life.   In our cosmological scheme, inside each volume 

V

OU

4
R
π=
3

3
OU

,  there  exist  cosmological  causes  which  precede  their  associated 

cosmological effects as implicitly are requested by Penrose [18] 

3)  The probability for our scheme to occur is one; provided that the vacuum cosmic space 

has  a  crystalline  structure  and  a  lattice  parameter  of  the  order  of  the  neutron  radius.  

This probability is a very high number as compared with the probability of spontaneous 
occurrence  for  the  beginning  of  the  Big  Bang  standard  model:  one  part  in  ((10)10)123, 

which is the figure calculated by Penrose [18]. 

 
4)  By  using  the  expression  for  the  Schwarzschild  radius  RS  =  2GM/c2  with  G  as  the 

gravitational  constant,  and  M  for  the  mass  of  a  black  -  hole  [19]  it  is  clear  that 

expression (1)  becomes the Bekenstein - Hawking formula [4, 20] for the black - hole 

entropy SBH,

         which, shows that black holes formed by many baryons have entropy proportional to 

its surface area (measured at RS).  Our analysis shows that Eq. (1), due to Bekenstein, 

when  used  for  the  gravitational  waves  which  stabilizes  the  crystalline  structure  of 

vacuum cosmic space, gives an expression for entropy which depends only on R not 
on R2. This situation and the well known fact that baryons (or neutrons), as the black 

holes,  only  exhibit  mass,  charge  and  angular  momentum  as  measurable  external 

parameters  suggest  that  two  kinds  of  black  holes  exist.  One  kind  formed  by  many 

baryons  [19-32],  and  another  formed  by  gravitational  waves;  in  future  papers  both 

kind  of  black  hole  will  be  analyzed  in  relation  to  our  theoretical  scheme  of  a 

crystalline vacuum cosmic space.

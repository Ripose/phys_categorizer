We  demonstrate  an  efficient  eigen-decomposition  method  for  analyzing  the  guided  modes  in  metal 
nanoparticle chains.    The proposed method has the advantage of showing the dispersion relation and 
mode  quality  simultaneously.    It  can  also  separate  the  material  and  geometrical  properties,  so  its 
efficiency does not depend on the complexity of the material polarizability.    The method is applied to 
analyze the guided modes of a single and a pair of metal chains.    The more accurate dynamic dipole 
polarizability  typically  gives  a  red-shift  compared  with  the  results  obtained  with  the  broadly  used 
quasistatic dipole polarizability with radiation correction. 

 

There are recent interests of using  metal nanoparticle 
(MNP)  chains  to  function  as  a  designable  subwavelength 
waveguide to transport optical signals.1,2    Wave propagation 
along  MNP  chains  is  mediated  by  coupled  plasmonic 
resonances.    Such  plasmonic  waveguides  may  serve  as  the 
building  blocks  for  making  nanoscale  optical  devices. 3 , 4   
However,  energy  loss  due  to  radiation  and  absorption  in 
MNPs can be serious, and thus the design of low loss MNP 
waveguides become a priority concern. 5-11 

To investigate the waveguide modes of periodic MNP 
chains, some authors calculated the dispersion relations.2,12-17   
In the presence of dissipation, the guided modes have a finite 
life-time,  and  cannot  be  described  completely  by  a  simple 
dispersion  relation  between  the  real  ω  and  real  k .    It  is 
customary to allow either one of  ω  and  k   to be a complex 
number.    Operationally,  this  requires  root  searching  of  a 
complex function in the complex number plane.    Such kind 
of  root  searching  is  time  consuming,  especially  when  full 
dynamic effect is considered.    Some authors, therefore, only 
relation  within  quasistatic 
calculate 
approximation.2,14 
the  retardation  effect 
include 
associated  with  radiation,  other  authors  use  the  quasistatic 
dipole approximation (DA) with radiation correction.12,13,15,16   
However, such an approximation is not accurate for particle 
size  greater  than  50  nm  when  absorption  loss  is  not 
negligible.18    Here, we demonstrate an eigen decomposition 
(ED)  method19,20  with  a  more  accurate  dynamic  DA21,22  to 
account  for  material  properties.    Such  method  does  not 
require a root searching in the complex plane.    The method 
consider  both  ω  and  k   on  the  real  line  and,  at  the  same 
time, shows effectively the qualities of the guided modes.

We  then  consider  the  more  rigorous  but  more 
complicated  dynamic  DA  (Eq.  (2)).    The  advantage  of  the 
method is that  σκk   is already calculated, no additional effort 
.    As  long  as  the 
is  needed  for  the  calculation  of 
single  particle  polarizability 
(ωα   is  given,  the  additional 
work is just a simple arithmetic calculation.    We note that if 
we  apply  complex  root  searching  for  the  dynamic  DA,  the 
task will be more tedious.    The results by our approach are 
shown in Fig. 1(c) and 1(d).    Again, the results obtained by 
complex  root  searching  with  quasistatic  DA  are  compared.   
In  addition  to  a  small  improvement  in  mode  quality,  we 
found  that  the  dispersion  curves  are  red-shifted  by  about 
∆ ωh

dynamic  DA  is  employed.    Since  such  correction  to  the 
mode frequency is not negligible, it shows that dynamic DA

The  above  results  are  calculated  using  a  high 
absorption  rate  (γ  =  0.7  eV),  and  Fig.  2  shows  the  results 
for  γ  =  0.1  eV  and  0.02  eV  which  are  more  relevant  for 
silver.    We keep the same 
pω   so that a direct comparison 
between  different  absorption  rates  can  be  made.    The 
qualities  of  the  guided  modes  have  a  great  improvement 
when  abosorption  rate  is  reduced,  especially  for  the  modes 
outside  light  cone  where  the  finite  line  width  originates 
purely from the resistive loss. 

Such  inter-chain  couplings  can  serve  to  manipulate  the 
guided modes, and should warrant further studies. 

In summary,  we demonstrated that the ED  method is 
very  good  for  making  a  quick  and  accurate  analysis  of  the 
plasmonic  modes  of  MNP  chains.    Such  method  separates 
the material and geometrical properties, so its efficiency does 
not depend on the complexity of the  material polarizability, 
and  more  accurate  dynamic  DA  can  be  used  without 
computation difficulty.

The  ED  method  can  also  be  applied  to  study  the 
plasmonic  modes  of  more  complex  systems  such  as  chain 
arrays,  and  higher  dimensional  structures.    As  an  example, 
we  consider  two  parallel  chains  with  the  distance  between 
chain axes being  b .    For simplicilty, we just consider the T 
modes  with  dipole  moments  perpendicular  to  the  plane 
containing the two chains (as shown in Fig. 3).    In this case, 
there  are  two  T  modes.    The  symmetric  (antisymmetric)  T 
mode,  denoted  by  ST  (AT),  has  each  dipole  of  one  chain 
being in-phase (out of phase) with the neareset dipole of the 
other chain.    Results for 
b =   = 75 nm are shown in Fig. 
a
3(a)  and  3(b).    The  ST  mode  has  a  dispersion  relation 
similar  to  the  T  mode  of  a  single  chain,  except  a  small 
increase  in  the  slope  inside  light  cone.    The  AT  mode  is 
very  different.  The  whole  band  has  a  small  but  negative 
gradient, and the  mode is  well-defined even inside the light 
cone.    Interesting results are also shown in Fig. 3(c) and 3(d) 
for  the  inter-chain  distance 
  =  375  nm,  which  is 
b
close to the wavelength of light in free space.    We can see a 
strong  modification  due  to  resonant  coupling.    Inside  the 
light cone, the ST (AT) mode has a red (blue) shift for small 
k .    Near the light line, the mode quality and the dispersion 
relation  has  obvious  changes  due  to  multiple  scattering 
between chains, i.e. the plasmonic guided modes are coupled 
with quasi-modes guided in the space between the chains.

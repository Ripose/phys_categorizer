ABSTRACT

The  generalized  Finsler  geometry,  as  well  as  Finsler  geometry,  is  a  generalization  of  Riemann

geometry. The generalized Finsler geometry can be endowed with the Cartan connection. The generalized

Finsler  geometry  and  its  Cartan  connection  are,  as  the  necessary  mathematical  tools,  involved  in  our

modification  of  special  relativity,  which  is  made  by  assuming  the  generalized  Finslerian  structures  of

gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  and  combining  this  assumption  with

two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the speed of light in all

Many relevant books and articles1 begin with a “taken” inertial coordinate system that we call the

usual inertial coordinate system and denote with {xr,t}, r=1,2,3, or {xi}, i=1,2,3,4, where x4=ict and c is

the speed of light. In it the authors of these books and articles assume the Euclidean structures of gravity-

inertial frames of reference.

and  write  down  various  equations  based  on  several  basic  principles  on  symmetries.  They  then  do

calculations, obtain results and compare the obtained results to experimental measurements.  By  “taken”,

we  mean  only  calling  and  using  without  discussing  this  coordinate  system.  There  are  at  least  two

important questions about  it.  The  first  question  is  whether  the  measurement  method  associated  with  the

usual inertial coordinate system is that we use in our experiments? In other words, what is the definition

                                               
1 In a summer, we spent an entire week in a university library to do investigation into the definition of the
usual inertial coordinate system from the measurement point of view. Holding Einstein’s definition made
in  his  Autobiographical  Notes,  we  were  concerned:  If  there  were  any  authors  who  tried  to  make  such  a
definition; If there were any definitions other than Einstein’s  definition;  If  there  were  any  authors  who
quoted Einstein’s definition. We looked through all relevant books and articles that we could catch. The
investigation results are: nobody, none and  nobody.

of the usual inertial coordinate system from the measurement point of view? The second one is whether or

not  the  local  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  are  Euclidean  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate

system?

Carrying  out  researches  in  the  field  of  theoretical  physics,  we  seem  to  have  to  answer  the  first

question before we compare those obtained results to experiments and be sure with the local structures of

gravity-free space and time before we write down equations and do calculations.

Einstein  exquisitely  answered  the  first  question.  Conceptually,  there  is  a  class  of  equivalent

inertial  frames  of  reference,  any  one  of  which  moves  with  a  non-zero  constant  velocity  relative  to  any

other and is supplied with motionless, rigid unit rods of equal length and motionless, synchronized clocks

of equal running rate. For each inertial frame of reference, Einstein defined the usual inertial coordinate

system: “in a given inertial frame of reference the coordinates mean the results  of  certain  measurements

with rigid (motionless) rods, a clock at rest relative to the inertial frame of reference defines a local time,

and  the  local  time  at  all  points  of  space,  indicated  by  synchronized  clocks  and  taken  together,  give  the

time  of  this  inertial  frame  of  reference.”[1]  As  defined,  in  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  an  observer

who is at rest with respect to that inertial frame of reference can employ his own motionless-rigid rods and

motionless-synchronized clocks in the so-called “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock”

measurement method to measure space and time intervals. By using this measurement method, he sets up

his usual inertial coordinate system. Since the “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock”

measurement method is that we use in our experiments, it is in reason to compare the calculation results

obtained in the usual inertial coordinate system to experimental measurements.

To  the  second  question  we  recently  gave  a  negative  answer  [2].  The  generalized  Finslerian

structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  were  assumed  [3,4].

Combining  this  assumption  with  two  fundamental  postulates  on  the  principle  of  relativity  and  the

constancy of the light speed, we modified special relativity. We re-formulated mechanics, field theory and

quantum  field  theory.  The  generalized  Finsler  geometry  and  its  Cartan  connection,  as  the  necessary

mathematical tools, were involved in.

or simply

Finsler geometry is a generalization of Riemann geometry. It was first suggested by Riemann as

early as 1854 [5], and studied systematically by Finsler in 1918 [6]. In Finsler geometry [5-10], distance

ds between two neighboring points xk and xk+dxk, k=1,2,---,n is defined by a scale function

which depends on directional variables dxk as well as coordinate variables xk. Apart from several routine

conditions like smoothness, the main constrains imposed on F(xk,dxk) are:

(A) It is positively homogeneous of degree one in dxk,

F(xk,l dxk)=l F(xk,dxk)  for l >0;

(B) It is positive if not all dxk are simultaneously zero,
F(xk,dxk)>0  for dxkdxk „ 0;

we can represent Finsler geometry in terms of

of degree zero in dxk,

gij(xk,dxk)=gji(xk,dxk),
gij(xk,l dxk)=gij(xk,dxk)  for l >0.

where  gij(xk,dxk)  is  called  the  Finslerian  metric  tensor  induced  from  scale  function  F(xk,dxk).  The

Finslerian metric tensor is symmetric in its subscripts and all its components are positively homogeneous

The Riemann geometry with metric tensor gij(xk) is nothing but the Finsler geometry with scale function
F(xk,dxk)=[gij(xk)dxidxj]1/2.

3. GENERALIZED FINSLER GEOMETRY

We can define the so-called generalized Finsler geometry by omitting Eq.(3) as a definition of ds

and  instead  taking  Eq.(8)  as  a  definition  of  ds2,  where  metric  tensor  gij(xk,dxk)  is  given  and  satisfies,

besides Eqs.(9) and (10) and some routine conditions, that quadratic form

gij(xk,dxk)PiPj, i,j=1,2,---,n,
is positive definite for all Pi and any (xk,dxk).

The generalized Finsler geometry is so-named because a Finsler geometry must be a generalized

Finsler geometry while a generalized Finsler geometry is not necessarily a Finsler geometry [10].

To see this, we prove a statement: The generalized Finsler geometry with positive definite metric

gij(xk,dxk) conditioned by Eqs.(9) and (10) is a Finsler geometry when and only when we can find a scale
function F(xk,dxk) by solving the set of Eqs.(7) such that this function satisfies conditions (A)-(C).

Actually,  if  this  generalized  Finsler  geometry  is  a  Finsler  geometry,  there  must  be  a  scale

function F’(xk,dxk) satisfying conditions (A)-(C) and ds=F’(xk,dxk). From F’(xk,dxk), we can find

g’ij(xk,dxk)= ¶ 2 F’2(xk,dxk)/2 ¶ dxi ¶ dxj,

and represent the Finsler geometry as

ds2=g’ij(xk,dxk)dxidxj. 

This  equation  coincides  with  Eq.(8)  because  the  Finsler  geometry  is  originally  the  generalized  Finsler

geometry  with  metric  gij(xk,dxk),  in  other  words,  g’ij(xk,dxk)=gij(xk,dxk).  Substituting  gij(xk,dxk)  for
g’ij(xk,dxk)  in  Eq.(12),  we  find  scale  function  F’(xk,dxk)  being  such  a  solution  to  the  set  of  Eqs.(7).

Reversely, if for this generalized Finsler geometry we can solve the set of Eqs.(7) and find a scale function

F(xk,dxk) satisfying conditions (A)-(C), F2(xk,dxk) must  be  positively  homogeneous  of  degree  two  in  dxk.

The following equation holds due to Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions,

2F2(xk,dxk)= dxi [ ¶ F2(xk,dxk)/ ¶ dxi].

Iterating Eq.(13), we have

4F2(xk,dxk)= dxj d

ij[ ¶ F2(xk,dxk)/ ¶ dxi]
+dxj dxi[ ¶ 2F2(xk,dxk)/  ¶ dxj ¶ dxi].

Using Eq.(13) in Eq.(14), we have further

F2(xk,dxk)= dxj dxi[ ¶ 2F2(xk,dxk)/ 2 ¶ dxj ¶ dxi].

Eq.(15)  combines  with  Eqs.(7)  and  (8)  to  yield  Eq.(3).  This  generalized  Finsler  geometry  is  a  Finsler

geometry.

As the set of partial differential  equations,  Eqs.(7),  does  not  always  have  such  solution  of  scale

function F(xk,dxk) for an arbitrarily given positive definite metric gij(xk,dxk) conditioned by Eqs.(9-10), a

generalized Finsler geometry is not necessarily a Finsler geometry.

4. THE CARTAN CONNECTION

The  generalized  Finsler  geometry  can  be  endowed  with  the  Cartan  connection.  There  are  two

kinds of  covariant  partial  derivative.  There  exist  three  distinct  curvature  tensors  that  we  call  the  Cartan

curvature tensors.

4.1. The Cartan connection

Let us consider the generalized Finsler geometry with metric tensor gij(xk,dxk) or gij(xk,zk), where

zk=dxk/db, k=1,2,---,n, and db is a positive invariant. The pair (xk,zk) is called the element of support.

According to Cartan, the absolute differentials of vectors Xi and Xi  can be written as
DXi=dXi+ Ci

kh(x,z)Xkdxh,
i

kh(x,z)Xkdzh+ G
ih(x,z)Xkdzh- G k

ih(x,z)Xkdxh,

DXi=dXi- Ck
kh  and  G

where  Ci

i
kh  are  the  affine  coefficients.  In  Eqs.(16a-16b)  abbreviations  x  and  z  are  respectively

taken for xk and zk in parentheses. Two kinds of covariant partial derivative, Xi

|h, Xi|h and Xi

||h, Xi||h, can be

defined by

DXi= Xi

|hdxh+ Xi

||hDzh,  

(13)

(14)

(15)

(16a)

(16b)

(17a)

DXi= Xi|hdxh+ Xi||hDzh,

where Dzk denotes the absolute differential of zk.

Again according to Cartan, the following conditions determine the Cartan connection.

(a)  If  the  direction  of  vector  Pi  coincides  with  that  of  its  element  of  support  (x,z),  its  square  of

length is to be equal to

gij(x,P)PiPj.
(b) If Pi and Qi represent two vectors with a common element of support (x,z), a symmetry stands

(18a)

(d)  The  coefficients  G *i

hk(x,z),  whose  definitions  are  given  below,  are  symmetric  in  their  lower

between them,

gij(x,z)Qi(DPj)=gij(x,z)Pi(DQj).
(c) for vector zk, it holds that

4.2. The Cartan curvature tensors

In  the  generalized  Finsler  geometry,  there  are  two  distinct  kinds  of  covariant  partial  derivative

for  vector  Xi,  Xi

|h  (the  first  kind)  and  Xi

||h  (the  second  kind),  and  hence,  three  distinct  kinds  of  second-

order covariant partial derivatives, Xi

|h|k , Xi
tensors  which  are  respectively  in  connection  with  commutation  relations,  Xi

|h||k and Xi

These curvature tensors satisfy a large number of identities.

5. SPECIAL CASES OF GENERALIZED FINSLER GEOMETRY

If metric tensor gij(xk,zk) is zk-independent, Eq.(8) becomes
ds2=gij(xk)dxidxj.

In  the  case,  the  generalized  Finsler  geometry  reduces  to  a  Riemannian  geometry  and  the  Cartan

connection reduces to the Levi-Civita connection. Moreover, tensor Ri

jkh reduces to the Riemann curvature

If metric tensor gij(xk,zk) is xk-independent, the covariant partial derivative of the first kind reduces to the

6. LOCAL STRUCTURES OF GRAVITY-FREE SPACE AND TIME

Einstein  defined  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3,  for  each  inertial  frame  of

reference,  through  associating  it  with  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”

measurement  method.  The  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement

method  is  not  the  only  one  that  the  motionless  observer  in  each  inertial  coordinate  system  has.  We

imagine other measurement methods for him. By taking these other measurement methods he can set up

other  inertial  coordinate  systems,  just  as  well  as  he  can  set  up  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  by

taking the “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method. One of these

other inertial coordinate systems is called the primed inertial coordinate system and denoted with {x’r,t’},

In Ref.[3,4], we assumed that gravity-free space and time possess the Euclidean structures in the

primed  inertial  coordinate  system  and  the  following  non-Euclidean  structures  in  the  usual  inertial

and  (x1+dx1,x2+dx2,x3+dx3,t+dt)  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  The  generalized  Finslerian

structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  are  specified  by  metric

tensors grs(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt) and  g(dx1,dx2,dx3,dt),  which  depend  only  on  directional  variables  and  become

Euclidean when and only when y approaches zero.

We also combined the assumption Eqs.(35) with two fundamental postulates, (i) the principle of

relativity and (ii) the constancy of the speed of light in all inertial frames of reference, to modify special

relativity. The modified special relativity theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite

in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite c in the usual inertial coordinate system. It involves the

c’-type  Galilean  transformation  between  any  two  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  the  localized

Lorentz transformation between any two usual inertial coordinate systems. Since all our experimental data

are collected and expressed in the usual inertial coordinate system, the physical principle in the modified

special relativity  theory  is:  the  c’-type  Galilean  invariance  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  plus

the transformation from the primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial  coordinate  system.  In

the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  we  write  all  physical  laws  in  the  c’-type  Galilean-invariant  form

and  do  all  calculations  in  the  c’-type  Galilean-invariant  manner;  we  finally  transform  these  calculation

results  from  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  and  compare

them to experimental facts. The assumption Eqs.(35) implies

in the usual (Newtonian) velocity-coordinates {yr}, r=1,2,3, where Y=dX/dT is the real speed or velocity-

length,  y’r=dx’r/dt’  is  called  the  primed  velocity,  yr=dxr/dt  is  the  well-defined  Newtonian  velocity.  The

velocity  space  has 

the  Riemannian  structure 

in 

the  usual  velocity-coordinates.  The  different

representations of the velocity space in the primed and the usual velocity-coordinates led to the relativistic

corrections to the Maxwellian velocity distribution [11].

It is very important to define the primed inertial coordinate system from the measurement point

of view. We do this somewhere else [12].

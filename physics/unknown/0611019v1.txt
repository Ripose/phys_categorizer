Single-shot Measurement of Femtosecond Laser

Photocurrents

Abstract—Through examining the product of the mathematical 
variance  of  intensity  with  respect  to  time  and  frequency,  we 
arrive  at  a  temporal  characterization  of  laser  pulses  through 
parameters  for  pulse  duration,  group  delay  dispersion  and 
temporal  form.  These  statistics,  which  are  sufficient  to  predict 
subsequent  pulse  behavior,  are  recoverable 
in  a  simple 
experiment,  measuring  the  two-photon-induced photocurrents in 
two  photodiodes,  we 
three  nonlinear  diodes.  With  only 
demonstrate  that  pulse  durations  as  low  as  several  tens  of 
femtoseconds can be easily measured in a single shot if the usual 
assumptions  of  pulse  form  and  dispersion  are  made  as  in  the 
more difficult autocorrelation setup.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

N  current  ultrafast  optical  science,  pulse  duration  and 
dispersion  are  some  of  the  most  elusive  characteristics  to 
measure,  yet  they  are  key  in  anticipating  the  nonlinear 
behavior and nonlinear effects created during subsequent wave 
propagation that are the primary interest of this field [1]. The 
standard  procedure  to  estimate  pulse  duration  relies  on  an 
experimentally  tedious  autocorrelation  measurement  [2],  [3], 
[4].  Since  a  direct  linear  autocorrelation  measurement  only 
gives information about the coherence length of the pulse, the 
measurement  in  a  linear  diode  necessitates  an  SHG  signal 
generated  in  a  thin  nonlinear  crystal.  Now  the  advent  of 
inexpensive  nonlinear  diodes  has  allowed direct second-order

slightly  less  elaborate  autocorrelation  measurement,  thereby

extract  pulse  duration 

the  form  approached  after 

the 
autocorrelation  signal,  a  specific  temporal  form,  usually 
gaussian  or  hyperbolic  secant,  is  assumed  for  all  pulses  from 
the  laser.    In  actuality,  the  envelope  is  most  likely  something 
between a hyperbolic secant and a gaussian, the former being 
the solitonic propagation form selected in the laser cavity, and 
the 
traversing 
significant  quantities  of  dispersive  media.  The  pulse  duration 
is usually defined as the FWHM of the assumed pulse intensity 
as a function of time, which may not always reflect the actual 
pulse  duration.  Although  there  exist  also  methods  like 
frequency-resolved optical gating [6], frequency domain pulse 
measurement [7], [8], and the SPIDER technique [9], [10] for 
complete  E-field  amplitude  and  phase  recovery,  such  a 
detailed  description  of  the  femtosecond  pulse  is  usually  not 
mandatory  and  does  not  justify  the  required  experimental 
labor. Further, even if they do not presuppose a temporal form, 
these  latter  methods  still  either  assume  uniform  laser  pulses 
during the data set acquisition or require tedious experimental 
preparation. Moreover, in this ultrashort light pulse, one has to 
worry about the carrier frequency all along the pulse envelope. 
In  an  ideal,  so-called  chirpless  pulse,  the  instantaneous 
frequency is stationary. 

In  light  of  these  considerations,  we  propose  a  simple, 
parametric statistical description of the laser pulse without the 
maze of unwieldy calculations of a complete E-field recovery. 

 

II.  STATISTICAL DESCRIPTION OF LASER PULSES 

As  widely  accepted  for  the  space  domain,  the  proposed 
description  relies  upon  the  variance  of  pulse  intensity  I  with 
respect to time, Δt2, and frequency, Δω2, each being defined as 
an rms value in the normal fashion in terms of moments:

We  adopt  Δt=(Δt2)1/2  as  our  definition  of  pulse  duration  τ, 
conferring  the  benefit  of  an  unambiguous  measure  that  is 
resistant  to  possible  asymmetries  and  noise  in  temporal form. 
A major advantage of our definition over FWHM is that it also 
reflects  satellite  peaks  that  may  occur  around  the  primary 
pulse,  and  to  which  the  media  may  respond.    This  however, 
does  also  have  the  drawback  of  increased  sensitivity  towards 
far away but weak satellite pulses. 

The  uncertainty  principle  dictates  that  the  product  Δt  Δω 
must be at least 1/2.  We define a form factor M2 [11] for the 
pulse  corresponding  to  the  area  it  would  occupy  in  the  time-
frequency Wigner plane [12] if the pulse had no dispersion:  

 

 

The  characterization  of  the  pulse  form  M2,  dispersion 
 proves to 

parameter κ2, and minimal pulse duration τ0 =
be  sufficient  to  describe  and  model  many  of  the  interesting 
phenomena associated with femtosecond pulses. For example, 
propagation  of  a  pulse  through  dispersive  media  adds  a 
quadratic phase encompassed in the parameter κ.

These  statistical  parameters  characterize  the  pulse  during 
propagation  through  a  dispersive  medium  in  a  manner 
analogous  to  that  commonly  employed  in  the  study  of  beam 
propagation across different planes. Instead of a CCD camera, 
as  in  spatial  characterization,  two-photon  absorption  in  a 
GaAsP diode is used.

Assuming  no  spatio-temporal  coupling,  the  photocurrent

III.  TWO-PHOTON DIODE RESPONSE 

M2  is  always  at  least  1,  this  minimal  value  being  strictly 
achieved  for  a  Gaussian  pulse.  M2  for  a  hyperbolic  secant  is 
1.05, 1.4 for a Lorentzian, and 6.54 for a square pulse. M2 can 
be used to place the form of the impulse along this scale. 

 

Now we consider the pulse propagating through a dispersive 

medium. The field

assuming that the pulse is long enough that the response is the 
same for its entire spectrum. T is the period of repetition of the 
laser and Pm is the average power, easily measured by a linear 
diode in parallel with the nonlinear diodes. τ is the duration of 
the  pulse,  and Δr  is  the  beam  waist  size  at  the  diode  surface, 
defined in a similar fashion to Δt in the spirit of the statistical 
description.  αspatial  and  αtemporal  are  coefficients  depending  on 
the form of the pulse. 

We experimentally checked the inverse dependence of SNL 
on the rms definition of pulse duration. After broadening with 
a stretcher, τ was calculated both from the measured 
photocurrent (9) induced by the focused laser beam and from 
the introduced dispersion by (7). Fig. 1 shows correlation up to 
a few fs. The accuracy is limited essentially by power 
fluctuations of the laser and beam size evolution during 
propagation through the dispersion line.

IV.  EXTRACTION OF PULSE PARAMETERS FROM TWO-PHOTON 
CURRENTS 

The  standard  nonlinear  diode  approach  to  pulse  duration 
relies on calibration of the signal SNL via an autocorrelation to 
obtain  the  transfer  function  of  the  diode.    This  method 
presupposes  interpulse  consistency  in  all  parameters,  such  as 
the  mean  power  and  spot  size  on  the  detector,  and  is  thus 
complicated  by  the  unavoidable  fluctuations  of  all  these 
parameters  in  time.    While  it  is  possible  to  extract  the 
statistical description of the pulse from an autocorrelation and 
spectral measurement [11], we propose a simpler experimental 
setup. 

The  solution  relies  on  the  responses  of  three  two-photon 
diodes  under  different  added  phases  in  a  static  experiment.  
Indeed,  without  any  assumption  of  form,  it  is  possible  to 
determine the group delay dispersion in a single pulse. Let S0 
be  the  photocurrent  signal  of  the  pulse  with  only  the  original 
quadratic  phase  Achirp  present  upon  exiting  the  laser  aperture. 
Let  S1  and  S2  be  the  signal  after  the  pulse  has  traversed  two 
known thicknesses e1 and e2 of crystal to add quadratic phases 
b1 and b2. Unlike an SHG and linear diode autocorrelation, the 
crystal in our setup does not distort the pulse being measured 

 

where  α  encompasses  all  of  the  signal-affecting  parameters 
from  (9)  that  are  constant  from  diode  to  diode  (or,  if  not 
constant, whose ratio can be extracted to appropriately weight 
Si  from  the  setup  without  b1,  b2),  gives  us  the  original 
quadratic phase Achirp:

It  is  noteworthy  that  by  exactly  compensating  for  this  group

configuration,  we  can  obtain  the  minimal  possible  pulse 

duration  for  this  temporal  form, 

.  Additionally,  we

A  spectrogram  has  to  be  used  in  parallel  with  the  three 
diode  configuration  to  measure  the  spectral  width  Δω  of  the 
original pulse. (14) and (15) are established for the same mean 
power  on  the  three  diodes.  An  experimental  measurement  is 
required  to  calibrate  the  set-up  by  using  a  linear  diode  to 
recover the transmission power of beamsplitters and weight S0, 
S1  and  S2  appropriately.  Moreover,  if  they  are  not  precisely 
known, in order to evaluate precisely the dispersion b1 and b2 
(which  include  the  dispersion  of  the  glass  pieces,  the 
beamsplitter,  and  the  lenses),  we  can  use  the  spectral 
interferometry  technique  [13],  [14]  that  relies  upon  the 
spectrogram of two optical pulses.   

 

V.  CHOICE OF DISPERSIVE MEDIA IN THE SETUP 

The  choice  of  dispersive  media  (dispersion,  thickness)  is 
crucial for measuring pulse parameters. If we suppose that the

The calibration coefficient ratio Г0 is determined by repetitive

measurements  of  the  ratio  Γ b  with  the  5-mm  ZnSe  slab,  we

2.5 and Г0 = 10.3 ± 0.1, yielding the calculated τFWHM of 115 
fs.  This agrees well with the autocorrelation measurement of 
τFWHM as 120 fs.  The experimental measurement range is here 
limited to 50-150 fs (Fig. 4). The lower limit arises from a low 
photocurrent in diode 2, while the upper limit is due to limited 
broadening causing an inaccurate ratio. 

 

 

 

relative error of each signal S0, S1, and S2 is equal to 1%, we 
can  establish  the  features  of  the  dispersive  media.  Here  the 
GaAsP photodetector perfectly matches the requirements. 

For  example,  in  the  case  of  a  gaussian  pulse  (M2  =  1)  that 
would  be  100-fs,  were  it  not  lengthened  by  group  delay 
dispersion, the duration is measured with a relative error of 2% 
for  SF59  glass  (dispersion 0.2932 fs2/μm for λ=0.8 μm) with 
e1 = 4 cm and e2 = 13 cm. For this set of glasses, we are able to 
measure  an  initial  group  delay  dispersion  between  6000  fs2 
and 27000 fs2 with a relative error less than 20%. The relative 
error of M2 is approximately 1.8%. 

In the case of a 10-fs pulse, another set of glasses must be 
chosen.  For  example,  with  a  BK7  glass  (dispersion  0.04459 
fs2/μm  for  λ=0.8  μm),  we  obtain  a  relative  error  of  pulse 
duration equal to 2% with e1= 3 mm and e2=9 mm. For this set, 
the  group  delay  dispersion  can  be  measured  between  50  fs2 
and  300  fs2  with  a  relative  error  less  than  20%,  and  the 
accuracy of the M2 factor is unchanged.  

The best choice of glass set is dictated by the pulse features, 
and for improved accuracy, the pulse should be measured with 
a  few  sets.  The  spectral  width  of  the  pulse  already  gives  an 
indication  of  the  glass  of  choice.  This  technique  is  especially 
well adapted for systems (e.g. amplified lasers) that profit from 
a minimization of pulse group delay dispersion. 

 

VI.  MEASUREMENT OF TEMPORAL WIDTH OF NON-DISPERSED 
PULSE WITH KNOWN FORM USING TWO GAASP PHOTODIODES 

 
If  one  makes  the  usual  assumptions  for  an  autocorrelation 
measurement  of  no  group  delay  dispersion  and  known  pulse 
form,  laser  pulse  temporal  width  can  be  extracted  in  a  single 
shot from just two photodiodes in a particularly simple setup.  
We  characterized  a  Ti:Sapphire  oscillator  using  two  GaAsP 
photodiodes  (G1118  Hamamatsu,  well  adapted  for  the  range 
700 to 1100 nm). As shown in the experimental setup (Fig. 3), 
the  laser  beam  is  split  in  two  unbalanced  arms,  with  a  high 
dispersive  piece  of  5mm  ZnSe  slab  (dispersion  ZnSe  = 
1.03549 fs²/µm) in one arm. Both beams are carefully focused 
onto the photodiodes.

VII.  CONCLUSION 

A  statistical  description  proves  to  be  useful  in  describing 
femtosecond  laser  pulse  evolution  through  dispersive  media.  
Further,  a  complete  characterization  of  the  pulse  in  terms  of 
form,  group  delay  dispersion,  and  duration  is  achievable  in  a 
simple  static  experimental  setup  with  three  nonlinear  diodes.  
No assumptions are required to extract group delay dispersion 
information,  and  if  a  spectrogram  is  available,  form  and 
duration  can  also  be  measured  without  the  conventional 
assumptions.  Using only two diodes as described here, we can 
extract pulse duration for a non-dispersed, gaussian pulse in a 
single  shot,  and  results  are  in  excellent  agreement  with 
autocorrelation measurements.

Fig.  5  shows  several  measurements  of  the  same  laser  for 
different input power in the setup. Sensitivity limits are due to 
either  a  very  small  photocurrent  (due  to  dark  current  and 
thermal  noise)  or  amplifier  saturation.  Measurement  of  1mW 
average power is possible with this setup.

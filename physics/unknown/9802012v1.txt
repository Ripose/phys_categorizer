Abstract

The Casimir operators of a Lie algebra are in one-to-one correspondence with the
symmetric invariant tensors of the algebra. There is an inﬁnite family of Casimir
operators whose members are expressible in terms of a number of primitive Casimirs
equal to the rank of the underlying group. A systematic derivation is presented of
a complete set of identities expressing non-primitive symmetric tensors in terms of
primitive tensors. Several examples are given including an application to an excep-
tional Lie algebra.

1 Introduction

The Casimir operators for a simple Lie algebra are constructed from symmetric tensors
invariant under the adjoint action of the algebra. Given a simple compact Lie group of rank
l, it is known that there are l such primitive symmetric invariant tensors of order mi, i =
1 . . . l. The orders mi are in fact also known because of the correspondence of the primitive
symmetric invariant tensors with cocycles of order (2mi − 1) which are representatives of
the de Rham cohomology classes of G. However, most methods of constructing symmetric
invariant tensors give rise naturally to an inﬁnite family of them, of which only the ﬁnite
number l can be primitive.

In this paper, we present a method which systematically generates a complete set of identi-
ties expressing non-primitive symmetric invariant tensors in terms of primitive tensors. We
illustrate our methods using the algebras An and Bn and perform explicit calculations for
the examples A2, B2, and G2. It is particularly pleasing to be able to extract information
about the structure of G2 in such a straightforward manner.

2 Invariant symmetric tensors and Casimirs

Let G be a simple algebra of rank l with basis {Xi}, [Xi, Xj] = f k
ijXk, i = 1 . . . dim G, and
let G be its (compact) associated Lie group. In this section, we will follow the “physical”
convention and use hermitian generators and the normalization Tr(XiXj) = 2δij. When
the generators are assumed to be in matrix form, we take them to be in the deﬁning
representation of the algebra. We will assume there is no distinction between upper and
lower indices, their position being dictated by notational convenience. Let {ωj} be the
dual basis in G∗, ωj(Xi) = δj
i , and consider a G-invariant symmetric tensor h of order m

(2.1)

(2.2)

(2.3)

The G-invariance (ad-invariance) of h means that

h = hi1...imωi1 ⊗ . . . ⊗ ωim .

This is the case for the symmetric tensors k(m) given by the coordinates

where sTr is the unit-weight symmetric trace, sTr(Xi1 . . . Xim) =

Tr(Xiσ(1) . . . Xiσ(m)).

constructed in this way by selecting suitable representations.
Let G be compact so that the Killing tensor may be taken as the unit matrix and let hi1...im
be an arbitrary symmetric invariant tensor. Then the order m element in the enveloping
algebra U(G) deﬁned by

C(m) = hi1...imXi1 . . . Xim ,
commutes with all elements of G. This is so because the commutator [Xρ, C(m)] may be
written as

which is indeed zero as a result of the invariance condition (2.2). In fact, the only conditions
for the m-tensor h to generate a Casimir operator C(m) of G of order m are its symmetry
(non-symmetric indices would allow us to reduce the order m of C(m) by replacing certain
products of generators by commutators) and its invariance (eq. (2.5)); h does not need to
be obtained from a symmetric trace (2.3). Thus for any invariant symmetric tensor h of
order m, C(m) = hi1...imXi1 . . . Xim is a Casimir of G of the same order m.

It is well known [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] that a simple algebra of rank l has l independent
(primitive) Casimir-Racah operators of order m1, . . . , ml, the ﬁrst of them given by the
familiar quadratic Casimir [9] operator kijX iX j obtained from the Killing tensor (m1 = 2).
Thus there must be (Cayley-Hamilton) relations among the invariant tensors obtained from
(2.3) for m 6= ml or otherwise one would obtain an arbitrary number of primitive Casimirs.
We shall demonstrate this explicitly for several examples.

3 Relations among symmetric tensors

The results in this section involve an important result that, for a matrix A, we have the
relationship

detA = exp(Tr log A)

.

(3.1)

This is clearly true for diagonal A and can be seen to be true generally by conjugation of
A. We apply this to the case A = 1 + αF , with 1 the identity matrix. and α an arbitrary
parameter. We can treat the right hand side of (3.1) as a power series in α, giving

det(1 + αF ) = 1 −

In the above, TrF n is deﬁned as Fi1i2Fi2i3 · · · Fini1. All the terms to O(α8) are given as
these are the terms we shall use below. It is easy to calculate the terms in higher powers
of α. We consider a matrix representation of a Lie group G with generators {Xi}. For our
purposes we will always work with the fundamental representation. We deﬁne the matrix
F to be a linear combination of these, introducing a vector y, as (F )ab = yi(Xi)ab. If {Xi}
are d × d matrices, then no terms of O(αm) can appear in the determinant for m > d.
Thus these terms must vanish identically, giving us one equation at each order in α. This
gives us one equation for each of the non-primitive tensors of the form (2.3) in terms of
primitive tensors.

4 Examples

Below are given three explicit examples of construction of non-primitive tensors for simple
Lie algebras in terms of primitive tensors. Connections are also made to the geometry of
the associated Lie groups. In particular, simple compact Lie groups can be expressed as
products of spheres of odd dimension. Decomposing a Lie group into such a product gives
the de Rham cohomology as the Betti numbers [10] for a sphere Sn are known to be

b(0) = 1 ,

b(n) = 1 ,

b(k) = 0 otherwise

.

We can also associate with each symmetric invariant tensor k of order m an antisymmetric
invariant tensor of order (2m − 1) according to

Ωi1...i2m−2σ = f j1
[i1i2

. . . f jm−1

i2m−3i2m−2

kσ]j1...jm−1

.

If k is primitive, this gives a (2m − 1)-form on G representing a Lie algebra cocycle of order
(2m − 1). If k is non-primitive, the expression is identically zero [11].

4.1 The algebras An

The group SU(n + 1) has algebra su(n + 1) = An. The group manifold decomposes into n
spheres as SU(n + 1) → S2n+1 × S2n−1 × . . . × S3. Thus there are n non-trivial cocycles and
n corresponding primitive symmetric invariant tensors as in (4.2). There is a basis for the
symmetric invariant tensors of SU(n) given by Sudbery [12], consisting of one symmetric
tensor d(n) at each order n = 2, 3, . . .. Given a normalized basis {λi} for su(n + 1), we have
the multiplication law

λiλj =

δij + (dijk + ifijk) λk

.

(4.3)

n + 1

The tensors f and d are respectively the totally antisymmetric and symmetric structure
constants. The two lowest-order symmetric invariant tensors are δij and dijk. In terms of
these, the Sudbery basis for symmetric tensors is

For the group G = SU(n + 1), only the tensors d(k) for k = 2, 3, . . . , n + 1 will be primitive
and will give rise to representatives of the n primitive cocycles of G via (4.2).

4.2 The algebra A2
The fundamental representation of the algebra A2 = su(3) is in terms of eight (3 × 3)
hermitian matrix generators {λi}. The rank of A2 is two so we have two primitive invariant
symmetric tensors; these are given by

,

Tr(λiλj) = δij

The group manifold SU(3) can be decomposed into S5 × S3 and there are three- and
ﬁve-cocycles associated with δij and dijk respectively (see(4.2)). Deﬁning an arbitrary
eight-vector y, writing (F )ab = yi(Xi)ab and substituting this into (3.2) gives expressions
for d(m), m > 3 in terms of the tensors (4.5). Deﬁning ki1...im = sTr(Xi1 . . . Xim) as in (2.3),
the ﬁrst few of these are

sTr(λiλjλk) = dijk

4.3 The algebras Bn

The fundamental representation of the algebra Bn = so(2n + 1) is in terms of (2n + 1) ×
(2n + 1) antisymmetric matrices. We deﬁne a basis {Xi}, normalized as Tr(XiXj) = 2δij.
There will be n primitive symmetric invariant tensors (equal to the rank of the group).
The ﬁrst two of these are δij = 1
2 Tr(XiXj) and the order four totally symmetric tensor
[13] given by

Tr(X(iXjXk)) = d(4)

ijklXl

.

(4.11)

We notice that the tensors k(m) (given by (2.3)) vanish for m odd and we have a basis for
the symmetric tensors of Bn in analogy with Sudbery’s basis for An, i.e.

d(6)
i1i2i3i4i5i6 = d(i1i2i3

xdi4i5i6)x

.

...

(4.12)

The algebra Bn will have n primitive symmetric tensors of orders 2, 4, . . . , 2n, giving rise
to cocycles of orders 3, 7, . . . , (4n − 1) via (4.2).

4.4 The algebra B2
The fundamental representation of the algebra B2 = so(5) is in terms of (5 × 5) antisym-
metric matrices with a basis {Xi}, normalized as above. The group manifold decomposes
as SO(5) ∼ S3 × S7, giving non-trivial three- and seven-cocycles. The three-cocycle is as-
sociated with the symmetric tensor δij = 1
2Tr(XiXj) and the seven-cocycle with the order
four symmetric tensor d(4)
2Tr(X(iXjXk)Xl) according to (4.2). As above, we deﬁne an
arbitrary vector y, write (F )ab = yi(Xi)ab and substitute this into (3.2). The antisymmetry
of the algebra elements means that all traces of odd powers of F vanish identically, giving
the result at O(α6):

ijkl = 1

or equivalently

TrF 6 =

TrF 2TrF 4 −

(TrF 2)3

k(6)
i1i2i3i4i5i6 =

δ(i1i2k(4)

i3i4i5i6) − δ(i1i2δi3i4δi5i6)

.

Expressions for the higher-order symmetric tensors can be obtained easily.

(4.14)

4.5 The algebra G2
The algebra G2 can be embedded into so(7); the generators of SO(7) decompose into
representations 21 → 7 ⊕ 14 under the action of G2. We will work with the seven-
dimensional representation of G2 embedded into the fundamental representation of so(7).
This has generators {Xi}, normalized as Tr(XiXj) = 2δij. As for the orthogonal groups,
the terms odd in F in the expansion (3.2) will vanish identically. It is known [13] that
there are two primitive symmetric invariant tensors of G2, of order two and six. We note
the result from [14]:

sTr(XiXjXkXl) =

Tr(X(iXj)Tr(XkXl))

.

(4.15)

Using this and the methods described above, we can now write any symmetric invariant
tensor of G2 in terms of the two primitive symmetric tensors

ki1i2 = Tr(Xi1Xi2)

,

ki1i2i3i4i5i6 = sTr(Xi1Xi2Xi3Xi4Xi5Xi6)

.

5 Conclusion

A simple Lie group has a number of primitive symmetric invariant tensors equal to the
rank of the group. Other symmetric invariant tensors must be expressible in terms of these.
This is equivalent to expressing non-primitive Casimirs in terms of primitive Casimirs. We
have presented a systematic method for doing this which has been illustrated with three
examples including one example of an exceptional Lie algebra.

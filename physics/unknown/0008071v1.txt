Abstract

The  Low-Energy  Demonstration  Accelerator  (LEDA)
radio-frequency quadrupole (RFQ) is a 100% duty factor
(CW)  linac  that  delivers  >100  mA  of  H+  beam  at  6.7
MeV. 
  The  8-m-long,  350-MHz  RFQ  structure
accelerates  a  dc,  75-keV,  110-mA  H+  beam  from  the
LEDA  injector  with  >90%  transmission.  LEDA  [1,2]
consists of a 75-keV proton injector, 6.7-MeV, 350-MHz
CW  RFQ  with  associated  high-power  and  low-level  rf
systems, a short high-energy beam transport (HEBT) and
high-power  (670-kW  CW)  beam  stop.    The  beam
emittance is inferred from wire scanner measurements of
the  beam  profile  at  a  single  location  in  the  HEBT.  The
beam  profile  is  measured  as  a  function  of  the  magnetic
field gradient in one of the HEBT quadrupoles.  As the
gradient  is  changed  the  spot  size  passes  through  a
transverse  waist.    Measurements  are  presented  for  peak
currents between 25 and 100 mA.

1  INTRODUCTION

The primary objective of LEDA is to verify the design
codes,  gain  fabrication  knowledge,  understand  beam
operation,  measure  output  beam  characteristics,  learn
how  to  minimize  the  beam-trip  frequency,  and  improve
prediction  of  costs  and  operational  availability  for  the
APT accelerator.  The configuration of the LEDA RFQ
accelerator is shown in Figure 1.  This paper presents the
analysis of quad-scan measurements of the output beam
from the 6.7 MeV RFQ.

A  schematic  of  the  LEDA  HEBT  [3]  showing  the
location of beamline magnets and diagnostics is given in
Figure  2.    The  function  of  the  LEDA  HEBT  is  to
characterize the properties of the beam and transport the
beam  with  low  losses  to  a  shielded  beamstop.    The
beamline  magnets  consist  of  four  quadrupoles  and  two
sets of X-Y steering magnets.  The HEBT contains beam
diagnostics  that  allow  measurement  of  pulsed-beam-
current,  dc-beam-current,  and  bunched-beam-current  as
well  as  transverse  centroid,  longitudinal  centroid  (i.e.,
beam  energy  from  time-of-flight  and  beam  phase),  and
transverse  beam  profile  (wire  scanner  and  video
fluorescence) [4].

Quad-scan  measurements  were  made  using  only  the
first two  quadrupole  magnets.    For  the  horizontal  scan,
the  first  quadrupole  in  the  HEBT  was  fixed  while  the
second quadrupole was varied over a range between 4.7
T/m  and  10.7  T/m.    For  the  vertical  scan,  the  second
quadrupole  in  the  HEBT  was  fixed  while  the  first
quadrupole  was  varied  over  a  range  between  -7.0  T/m
and  -13.0  T/m.  In  both  cases  the  two  downstream
quadrupoles were off. The resulting beam size measured
at the wire profile monitor passes through a minimum as
the  gradient  is  varied.    In  each  scan,  beam  profile
measurements  were  typically  made  at  nine  different
settings.   Profile measurements were performed at beam
peak currents of 25, 50, 75 and 94 mA.  Many of these
measurements were repeated over a period of one month.

2  ANALYSIS

The  analysis  of  the  quad  scan  data  utilized  the  beam
optics  code  LINAC  [5]  and  only  addresses  the  rms
properties of the distribution.  The Twiss parameters a
,
, and  e  at the exit of the RFQ were adjusted to fit the
rms  widths  of  the  beam  distributions  taken  during  the
quad scans.  A six dimensional waterbag distribution was
assumed  although  the  analysis  is  generally  independent
of the distribution.  Initially, the Twiss parameters were
adjusted  to  fit  the  predicted  distribution  from  RFQ
simulations  (PARMTEQM  or  nominal)  for  a  94  mA
beam  current.    Beginning  with  these  Twiss  parameters,
the sensitivity to e , a
 was analysed at 94 mA for
the two transverse planes.  No attempt was made to study
the longitudinal properties of the distribution.

, and b

The data sets (rms width vs. quadrupole gradient) were
combined  and  analyzed  to  obtain  a  polynomial  fit  as
shown  in  Figures  3a  and  3b.    The  data  sets  represent
measurements made on three occasions.

Figures 3a and 3b.  Measured values of the rms beam
width (red triangles) and corresponding fits (long blue
dashes) at 94 mA.  The black curves (small dashes) show

the nominal RFQ output beam and the green (solid)
curves shows the best fit to the data using LINAC.

From  the  polynomial  fits  to  the  data  the  rms  beam
width  was  calculated  at  nine  gradient  settings.    The
LINAC  code  was  then  run  at  each  of  these  gradient
settings  for  a  specific  set  of  Twiss  parameters.    The
Twiss  parameters  were  then  optimized  by  minimizing
the sum of the squared errors (SSE) between the fit and

the results of the nine runs.  Typically, the SSE was less
than  1.0  mm2.    Figures  3a  and  3b  show  the  fits  to  the
data in the horizontal and vertical planes at 94 mA.  The
black  curve  labelled  nominal  represents  the  RFQ  beam
simulation  from  PARMTEQM  [6].    The  green  curve
represents the best fit by adjusting the Twiss parameters
according  to  the  label  (e.g.  110e  82b  107a  means  1.10
times the nominal emittance, 0.82 times the nominal beta
and  1.07  times  the  nominal  alpha).    These  parameters
indicate that the horizontal beam size is about 5% larger
at the RFQ exit with a 20% higher divergence than that
predicted by PARMTEQM.  In comparison, the vertical
beam  size  is  about  25%  larger  at  the  RFQ  exit  with  a
divergence

PARMTEQM.

The same analysis was performed on data taken at 25
mA.  The results are shown in Figures 4a and 4b.  The
analysis shows the horizontal beam emittance to be about
90% of the 94 mA emittance predicted by PARMTEQM
with the horizontal beam size about 12% smaller at the
RFQ  exit  and  the  divergence  about  4%  higher.    The
vertical  beam  distribution  has  an  emittance  close  to  the
design  prediction  at  94  mA  while  the  beam  size  and
divergence are about 75% of the nominal design.

A similar analysis has been performed for a quad scan

 3   DISCUSSION

During  commissioning  it  was  observed  that  the  RFQ
fields had to be increased 5-10% above the design value
for  optimal  transmission  [7].    The  effect  of  this  higher
field has been studied and does not result in significant

the 

distributions.    Beam  profiles  produced  by  LINAC  were
generally  in  good  agreement  with  the  measured  beam
profiles  for  the  lower  quadrupole  gradients  before  the
minimum.    After  the  minimum  the  measured  beam
distributions  exhibited  significant  tails  which  are  not
well reproduced by LINAC even though the rms widths
are in close agreement.  One difficulty in reproducing the
exact  shape  of  the  distribution  is  attributed  to  the  large
aspect  ratio  (>5)  between  the  horizontal  and  vertical
beam  widths  when  the  beam  is  at  a  waist  [9,10].    The
details  of  the  beam  distribution  from  the  RFQ  are  also
unknown.

IMPACT, a more sophisticated PIC beam-optics code,
has been used to analyze the quad scan distributions [9].
This  analysis  gives  essentially  the  same  rms  widths  as
LINAC  but  with  significantly  better  agreement 
in
predicting the shape of the profiles.

4 SUMMARY

The  rms  output  beam  parameters  from  the  6.7  MeV
LEDA  RFQ  have  been 
inferred  from  quad  scan
measurements  using  the  LINAC  beam  optics  code.
Analysis  of  the  data  presented  in  this  paper  continues.
We  are  now  preparing  to  intentionally  introduce  and
measure  the  beam  halo  in  a  52-magnet  FODO  lattice
[11]. 
  This  measurement  will  also  allow  for  an
independent measure of the beam emittance.

The  effects  of  beam  neutralization  were  investigated
for the 94 mA data.  A small reduction in the SSE was
observed in the horizontal quad scan data consistent with
about 10% neutralization.  Analysis of the vertical quad
scan  data  with  10%  neutralization  resulted  in  Twiss
parameters  that  were  within  5%  of  those  presented  in
Table 1.

A  rigorous  error  analysis  was  not  performed  in  the
analysis of the quad scan data.  The different errors that
contribute 
the  analysis  uncertainty  have  been
estimated.  These errors result from beam jitter (1.0 mm
typically),  measurement 
(0.5  mm),
background subtraction (< 0.5 mm), analysis uncertainty
(5%), and quadrupole gradient fluctuations (1-2%).  The
effect of beam jitter is most pronounced in the minimum
of the horizontal quad scan data where it is observed that
the  simulations  are  consistently

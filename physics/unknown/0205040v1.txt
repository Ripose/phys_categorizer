Abstract

          It  has  been  demonstrated  (gr-qc/9910036)  that  the  gravitational  and  inertial
masses  are  correlated  by    a  dimensionless  electromagnetic  factor,  which  can  be
different  from  one.  It  can  be  also    reduced,  nullified  or  made  negative  in  specific
electromagnetic conditions. This unexpected theoretical result  has been   confirmed
by    an  experiment  using  Extra-Low  Frequency(ELF)  radiation    on  ferromagnetic
light  on
(gr-qc/0005107).  Recently  another  experiment  using  UV 
material 
phosphorescent  plastic  has  confirmed    the  phenomenon.  Here  we  show  some
fundamental consequences of the correlation for the Quantum Cosmology.

Introduction

          In  a  previous  paper1  we  have
shown  that  the  gravitational  mass  and
the  inertial  mass  are  correlated  by  a
dimensionless    electromagnetic  factor.
The  general  expression  of  correlation
between  gravitational  mass  mg  and
inertial  mass  mi  ,  can  be  written  as
follows

          Initially  let  us  now  consider  the
the
problem  of 
spectral  red-shift  of  certain  galaxies
and stars.
          Several  observers  have  noticed
red-shift  values 
  cannot  be
explained      by  the  Doppler-Fizeau
effect  or  by  the  Einstein  effect  (the
gravitational  spectrum  shift,  supplied
by Einstein's theory).
          This  is  the  case  of  the  called
Stefan's  quintet  (a  set  of  five  galaxies
which  has  been  discovered  in  1877),
whose  galaxies  are 
located  at
approximately  the  same  distance  from
the  Earth,  according  to  very  reliable
and  precise  measuring  methods.  But,
when  the velocities of the galaxies are
measured by its red-shifts , the velocity
of    one  of  them  is  much  greater  than
the velocity of the others.
          Similar  observations  have  been
made    on  the  Virgo  constellation  and
spiral galaxies.
          Also the Sun presents a red-shift
greater  than  the    predicted  value  by
the Einstein effect.

of  the  gravitational  mass  of  the    point
of    emission,  before  to  use  the  well-
the
known  expression  below  of

correlated  to  its  mass.  If  the  star's
mass  is  less  than  1.4M (cid:1)   (  Schemberg-
Chandrasekhar's  limit),  its  becomes  a
white  dwarf.  If  its  mass  exceeds  that
limit,  the  pressure  produced  by  the
degenerate  state  of  the  matter  no
longer 
the
gravitational  pressure,  and  the  star's
continues.  Afterwards
contraction 
occurs the   reactions  between  protons
and  electrons  (  capture  of  electrons  ),
where  neutrons  and  anti-neutrinos  are
produced.
          The  contraction  continues  until
the system regains stability ( when the
pressure  produced  by  the  neutrons  is
sufficient 
the  gravitational
collapse).  Such  systems  are  called
neutron  stars.    There  is  also  a  critical
mass  for  the  stable  configuration  of
neutron  stars.  This  limit  has  not  been
fully defined as yet, but it is known that
it  is  located  between  1.8M (cid:1)   and  2.4M (cid:1) .
Thus, if  the    mass  of  the  star exceeds
2.4M (cid:1)  , the contraction will continue.
          Note  that  at  the  end  of  the
gravitational  contraction  of  stars,  there
is  a  natural  convergence  towards  a
neutrons  cluster in  which  the  neutrons
are continuously  compressed.
          We know that the neutrons have
a  spin  magnetic  field

already  existing  laws.  Consequently,
the  laws  were  not  created  for  the
"
Universe  and,  hence,  are  not 
Nature's  laws"  or  "laws  placed  on
Nature  by  the  Creator",  as  written
Descartes. They already existed as an
intrinsic part of the Creator.
          Thomas  Aquinas  had  a  very
clear  understanding  about  this.  He
talks about  the Eternal Law  "... which
exists  in  God's  mind    and  governs  the
whole Universe".
          We

opted  for  the  concentration  of  the

volume  so  that  the  evolution  of  the
Universe  would  proceed  in  the  most
convenient form for the purpose It had
in  mind  and  accordance  with  the  laws
inherent  in  Its  own  nature.  This  then
answers 
famous
the  Einstein's 
question:"  What  level  of  choice  would
God  have  had  when  building 
the
Universe?"
          Apparently, Newton was the first
to  notice  the  Creator's  option.  In  his
book    Opticks,  he  gives  us  a  perfect
view  of  how  he  imagined  the  creation
of the Universe:
" It seems possible  to me that God, in
the  beginning,  gave  form  to  matter  in
solid,  compacted  particles(...)  in  the
best  manner  possible  to  contribute  to
the purpose He had in mind ..."
the
          With  what  purpose  did 
the  Universe?  This
Creator  create 
to
to  be  difficult 
question  seems 
answer.  Nevertheless,  if  we  assume
the  Creator's  primordial  desire 
to
procreate,  i.e.,  to  generate  individual
consciences  from  Itself  so  that  the
latter  could  envolve  and  manifest    the
same  creating  attributes  pertaining  to
It,  then  we  can  infer  that,  in  order  for
them  to  envolve,  such  consciences
would need a Universe, and this might
have  been  the  main  reason  for  its
creation.  Therefore,  the  origin  of  the
the
Universe  would  be  related 

to

generation  of  said  consciences  and,
consequently, the materialization of the
primordial  neutrons  must  have  taken
place  at  the  same  epoch  as  when  the
Creator    decided  to  individualize  the
postulated primordial consciences.
          In  this  manner,  not  only  is  the
Material  Universe  a  creation  of  the
Creator  in  Itself,  but  also  the  Psychic
Universe.  Thus,  everything  is  in  the
Creator and It, being omnipresent, is in
everything. Consequently, It cannot be
displaced  by  another  consciousness,
not  even  by  Itself,  since  It  cannot,
under  the  same  aspect,  be  cause  and
effect  at  the  same  time,  nor  under  an
aspect,  be  cause  of  Itself  and,  under
another,  effect.  Thus,  the  Creator  is
immovable.
          As  Augustine  says  (Gen.  ad  lit
viii,  20),  "The  Creator  Spirit  moves
Himself neither by time, nor by place."
          Thomas  Aquinas 
(Theology)
also  already  had  considered  Creator's
immobility as necessary.

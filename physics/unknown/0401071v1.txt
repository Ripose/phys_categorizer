Abstract

Charge-transfer-to-solvent  (CTTS)  reactions  of  hydroxide  induced  by  200  nm

monophotonic or 337 nm and 389 nm biphotonic excitation of this anion in aqueous solution

have been studied by means of pump-probe ultrafast laser spectroscopy. Transient absorption
-, have been observed, from a few hundred femtoseconds out

kinetics of the hydrated electron, eaq

to 600 ps, and studied as function of hydroxide concentration and temperature. The geminate

decay kinetics are bimodal, with a fast exponential component (ca. 13 ps) and a slower power

"tail"  due  to  the  diffusional  escape  of  the  electrons.  For  the  biphotonic  excitation,  the

extrapolated fraction of escaped electrons is 1.8 times higher than for the monophotonic 200 nm
excitation  (31%  vs.  17.5%  at  25  oC,  respectively),  due  to  the  broadening  of  the  electron

distribution.  The  biphotonic  electron  detachment  is  very  inefficient;  the  corresponding
absorption coefficient at 400 nm is < 4 cm TW-1 M-1 (assuming unity quantum efficiency for the

photodetachment).

1

For [OH-] between 10 mM and 10 M, almost no concentration dependence of the time

profiles of solvated electron kinetics was observed. At higher temperature, the escape fraction of
the electrons increases with a slope of 3x10-3 K-1 and the recombination and diffusion-controlled

dissociation of the close pairs become faster. Activation energies of 8.3 and 22.3 kJ/mol for these

two  processes  were  obtained.  The  semianalytical  theory  of  Shushin  for  diffusion  controlled

reactions in the central force field was used to model the geminate dynamics. The implications of

these results for photoionization of water are discussed.

I. INTRODUCTION

In liquids consisting of polar molecules with no electron affinity, such as water, alcohols,

and acetonitrile, the loss of an electron from a photoexcited anion frequently involves a short-

lived mediating state that is unique to these polar liquids. [1] In this charge-transfer-to-solvent

(CTTS) state, the excess charge resides in a diffuse orbital that protrudes from the anion into a

cavity consisting of solvent molecules that belong to the 1st and 2nd solvation shells of the parent

anion. [2] For anions where the promoted electron originates from a p-orbital, such as the halides

and hydroxide anions, this diffuse orbital has primarily s-like character. This state is stabilized by

the  pre-existing  orientation  of  the  solvent  dipoles  that  leads  to  an  attractive  potential  for  the

electron.  Similar  electrostatic  attraction  is  known  to  stabilize  solvated  electrons  in  the  bulk

liquid. A fully detached, thermally-relaxed electron is formed as the CTTS state dissociates (150-

300  fs)  and  the  resulting  species  equilibrates  with  the  solvent  (<  5  ps).  [3,4]  Bradforth  and

coworkers  have  shown  that  a  large  fraction  of  these  solvated  electrons  (that  are  spectrally

indistinguishable  from  the  bulk  species)  reside  in  close  proximity  to  their  geminate  partner

[5,6,7]  and  weakly  interact  with  it  by  means  of  an  attractive  potential  (the  energy  for  this

interaction  is  <  2-3  kT). [4]  It  is  presently  uncertain  what  fraction  of  these  close  pairs  are  in

actual contact or separated by a solvent molecule, or what is the barrier between these forms.

Photodetachment from alkalide anions in tetrahydrofuran also leads to the formation of close

pairs;  Schwartz  and  coworkers  have  interpreted  their  observations  in  terms  of  populations  of

contact  and  solvent  separated  pairs.  [8,9]  It  is  likely  that  (i)  both  types  of  these  pairs  are

generated in the photoexcitation of small inorganic anions and (ii) for some of these anions (e.g.,

alkalides), the corresponding branching ratio depends upon the excitation energy. [10,11]

One of the less studied CTTS reactions is photoinduced detachment of the electron from

aqueous hydroxide anion. This photoreaction yields a geminate pair of hydroxyl radical (OH)

Although  the  structure  of  the  aqueous  hydroxide  is  commonly  written  as  OH-,  it  is  in  fact

strongly bonded on average to 3-to-4 water molecules through the oxygen atom leading to strong

solvent  ordering.  [12-15]  There  is  also  rapid  proton  transfer  along  this  hydrogen  bonded

(4)

According to Rabani [23], other reactions of OH and O- with aqueous anions (e.g., halides) and

neutral molecules (e.g., alcohols) also have similar rate constants.

Photoreaction (1) satisfies all of the criteria for a CTTS reaction. In the gas phase, the

vertical electron detachment energy for OH- is very low, ca. 1.83 eV [24]. Recent ab initio [14]

calculations for OH-(H2O)n clusters (n<6) suggest that an addition of several water molecules

causes a strong increase in the ionization energy (from 3.62 eV for n=1 to 6.2-6.3 eV for n=5)

and concomitant increase in the CTTS energy (from 3.4 eV for n=1 to 5.3-5.6 eV for n=5); see

Table SII in ref. [14]. The CTTS band of OH- in the UV has been observed in polar solvents

only. In water, this band has a maximum at 6.62 eV (where the extinction coefficient is 3,860 M-

1  cm-1) and a half-width of 0.74 eV; the oscillator strength is 0.109 [25]. The position of the

CTTS band maximum for OH- changes with the solvent polarity in the same manner as that for I-

[1,25].  The  only  feature  that  distinguishes  OH-  from  other  CTTS  anions  is  that  the  UV

absorbance does not decrease with increase in the temperature [25]. Apart from this 6.6 eV band,

there is some evidence for a low-intensity 7.44 eV band for OD- in heavy water [25]. This weak

VUV band may be due to the second CTTS transition of the hydroxide. Originally, the 6.6 eV

band of the aqueous OH- was classified as a CTTS band because its position compared well with

the energy calculated using the "diffuse model" of Stein and Treinin [1,26]. Subsequent time-

resolved studies showed that eaq

- is generated shortly after the photoexcitation of OH- in the 180-

200  nm  region  [27].  Delahay  [28,29]  and  Takahashi  et  al.  [30]  showed  that  in  aqueous  and

5

acetonitrile solutions, the CTTS energy increases linearly with the threshold electron detachment

energy, as measured by photoemission spectroscopy of these solutions. Hydroxide appears on

this  CTTS  energy  vs.  threshold  electron  detachment  energy  plot,  between  Cl-  and  Br-.  This

correlation further supports the existence of a CTTS state capable of dissociating into OH and

eaq

-. A quantum yield of 0.11 was given for rxn. (1) in 185 nm [31] and 193 nm [32] photolysis

of aqueous OH- solutions. Femtosecond photodetachment from hydroxide ions was reported by

Eisenthal and coworkers, [33] indicating rapid ejection and trapping of electrons. However, only

a brief report was given by these workers, and the exact nature of the excited state or the energy

deposited in OH- in this study is unclear.

Our interest in hydroxide is twofold. First, geminate pairs of the OH radical and eaq

- are

also  produced  in  the  ionization  of  water.  Thus,  rxn.  (1)  provides  an  opportunity  to  study  the

dynamics  of  such  a  pair  without  the  interference  from  hydronium  ion  (H3O+)  which  is  also

generated  in  the  ionization  (e.g.,  refs. [34-39]).  In  principle,  the  contact  reaction  rate  for  the

hydrated  electron  with  OH  can  be  determined  along  with  its  temperature  dependence.  In

addition, there have been suggestions that a short-lived CTTS-like state of the hydroxide (or,

perhaps, a contact pair of the OH radical and a pre-thermalized electron) is involved in water

photoionization. [39] Because our experiment leads to the unambiguous preparation of a pair, we

can put such a suggestion to a rigorous test. Second, OH- may behave in a qualitatively different

way from other CTTS anions. It is a small anion strongly hydrogen-bonded to water, and this

bonding may work "against" the formation of a CTTS state if a cavity near the anion is to be

filled by the detached electron.

Below, we examine the electron and OH dynamics in 200 nm excitation of aqueous OH-.

These dynamics were studied as a function of temperature and hydroxide concentration (section

6

III.A). Quite different dynamics were observed in 2-photon excitation of OH- with 337 and 389

nm light (section III.B). Both types of the dynamics are indicative of a weak attraction between

the hydrated electron and the OH radical (section IV).

II. EXPERIMENTAL.

Laser spectroscopy. Most of the kinetic measurements reported below were obtained using a 1

kHz Ti:sapphire setup at Argonne. [40] A diode-pumped 5 W Nd:YVO laser was used to pump a

Kerr lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser operating at 80 MHz (Spectra Physics Tsunami). The 45

fs pulses from the oscillator where stretched to 80 ps in a single grating stretcher.  Single pulses

were then selected at 1 kHz with a Pockels cell. The 2 nJ pulses were amplified to 4 mJ in a

home-built two-stage multipass Ti:sapphire amplifier. The amplified pulses were passed through

a grating compressor that yielded Gaussian probe pulses of 60 fs FWHM and 3 mJ centered at

800 nm. The pulse-to-pulse stability was typically 3%.

The amplified beam was split into three parts of approximately equal energy. One beam

was used to generate the probe pulses while the other two were used to generate the 200 nm

(fourth harmonic) pump pulses. The second beam was passed through two tandem BBO crystals

that generated the second (Type I, 500 µm, 29o) and third (Type II, 100 µm, 58o) harmonics. The

fourth harmonic is produced by upconversion of the third harmonic (266 nm) and the 800 nm

beam  in  a  third  BBO  crystal  (Type  I,  100  µm,  68o).  Up  to  20  µJ  of  the  200  nm  light  was

produced this way (300-350 fs FWHM pulse). The pump power, before and after the sample,

was  determined  using  a  calibrated  power  meter  (Ophir  Optronics  model  2A-SH).  The  probe

7

pulse was derived from the same Ti:sapphire laser beam and delayed in time as much as 600 ps

using a 3-pass 25 mm delay line (a gold corner cube mounted on a Nanomover II translation

stage). If not stated otherwise, the probe pulse was 800 nm. To obtain probe light of wavelength

other than 800 nm, a white light supercontinuum was generated by focussing the 800 nm light on

a 1 mm thick sapphire disk; the probe light was selected using 10 nm FWHM interference filters.

The pump and probe beams were perpendicularly polarized, focused to round spots of 60-

150 µm and 20-30 µm in 1/e radius, respectively, and overlapped in the sample at 6.5

. The spot

o

sizes were determined by scanning the beam with a 10-20 µm pinhole. The maximum fluences

of the 200 nm and 400 photons were 2.5x10-2 and 0.4 J/cm2, respectively. The signal and the

reference  signals  were  detected  with  fast  silicon  photodiodes,  amplified,  and  sampled  using

home-built  sample-and-hold  electronics  and  a  16-bit  A/D  converter.  A  mechanical  chopper

locked at 50% repetition rate of the laser was used to block the pump pulses on alternative shots.

The standard deviation for a pump-probe measurement was typically 10 µOD, and the "noise"

was  dominated  by  the  variation  of  the  pump  intensity  and  flow  instabilities  in  the  jet.  The

vertical bars shown in the kinetics (e.g., Fig. 1(a)) represent 95% confidence limits for each data

point. Typically, 150-200 points acquired on a quasi-logarithmic grid were used to obtain these

kinetics.

The experiments at USC were carried out using a 200 kHz Ti:sapphire amplified laser

and a pump-probe setup which has been fully described elsewhere. [3,4] Transient absorption

signals as low as 10 µOD can be studied using this pump-probe spectrometer. Excitation pulses

8

at  337  nm  were  generated  by  frequency  doubling  the  red  output  of  a  389  nm  pumped  OPA.

Pump irradiance at the sample of such pulses was ca. 7 GW/cm2. Alternatively, 389 nm pulses

were obtained by frequency doubling the regenerative amplifier fundamental. Pump irradiances

up to 175 GW/cm2 can be produced at this wavelength. The 650 nm probe was selected from the

white light supercontinuum generated in sapphire with a 25 nm FWHM bandpass interference

filter. The level of transient absorption arising from the solvent alone was checked at 389 nm.

The  contribution  is  less  than  7  %;  it  is  slightly  higher  at  337  nm.    The  instrument  response

function for both spectrometers is 350 fs or better.

Materials  and  the  flow  system.  Hydroxide  solutions  of  low  concentration  were  prepared  by

mixing  0.989  N  KOH  volumetric  standard  (Aldrich)  with  deaerated  nanopure  water;

concentrated  alkaline  solutions  were  prepared  by  dissolving  solid  KOH  and  NaOH  pellets

(Aldrich, highest purity) in this stock solution. The density and viscosity of concentrated alkaline

solutions were taken from ref. [41]. The experiments at the USC were carried out using a 1 mm

optical path flow cell with calcium fluoride windows. The experiments at Argonne were carried

out with a 150 µm thick, 6 mm wide high-speed (10 m/s) jet with a stainless steel nozzle. To

prevent the absorption of CO2 from the air, the jet was enclosed in a box that was constantly

purged with dry nitrogen; the solution was also constantly bubbled with N2. The pump and probe

beams entered through small holes made in this enclosure. The whole jet assembly was mounted

on a 3D translation stage.

An all 316 stainless steel and Teflon flow system was used to pump the solution through

this jet. For experiments above room temperature, a 0.5 L reservoir filled with the liquid sample

was placed in a circulation bath and equipped with an air-cooled condenser that was used to trap

the  water  vapor  carried  out  by  the  flow  of  nitrogen  used  to  purge  the  alkaline  solution.  The

9

photolyzed solution returns to the reservoir through this condenser. A gear pump was used to

circulate the solution at 0.5-0.75 dm3/min. A high-quality pressure regulator and pulse dampener

were  used  to  stabilize  the  flow  and  a  60  µm  pore  sintered  steel  filter  was  used  to  remove

cavitation  bubbles.  Before  entering  the  jet  assembly,  the  solution  passed  through  a  heat

exchanger. The temperature of the sample was measured using a hair-thin T-type thermocouple

inserted 2 cm upstream of the jet nozzle; the temperature of the sample was within 3 oC of the set

point of the bath.

III. RESULTS.

A. Monophotonic 200 nm excitation of OH-.

Fig. 1(a) (solid line) shows typical decay kinetics of 800 nm absorbance from hydrated

electron obtained in 200 nm excitation of N2-saturated 56 mM KOH in H2O at 25 oC (OH and O-

radicals do not absorb above 300 nm). Under these excitation conditions, almost all of the UV

light is absorbed in the 150 µm jet: given the extinction coefficient of 1,000 cm-1 M-1 for OH-,

the 1 e penetration depth of the pump light is 78 µm. Exactly the same kinetics were obtained for

sodium  hydroxide  (not  shown)  and  for  different  concentrations  of  KOH.  Fig.  1(a)  shows  the

comparison between the kinetics obtained for [OH-]=9.8, 56, and 98 mM. At very low hydroxide

concentration, [OH-] < 1 mM, and relatively high fluence of the 200 nm light, (0.5-2)x10-2 J/cm2,

two-photon  ionization  of  water  starts  to  compete  with  one-photon  excitation  of  OH-  and  the

kinetics change slightly; for that reason, all of our data were obtained for pH>12.

Qualitatively, the kinetics (for convenience, given on the logarithmic time scale) exhibit

three time regimes. In the first few picoseconds, there is a fast evolution of the photoinduced

absorbance  due  to  the  rapid  electron  thermalization.  In  Fig.  1(b),  we  show  that  after

10

normalization of the kinetics at 5 ps (a delay time where we can assume that the thermalization is

over), the signals obtained at 650, 800, and 1000 nm follow each other after the first 5 ps, within

the confidence limits. The traces differ in the shape of the short-lived thermalization stage only;

this type of spectral evolution in the first 2-3 ps is obtained in all experiments on ionization of

neat water [5,38,42,43,44] and has been observed in the CTTS photodetachment from aqueous

halides. [5] In the rest of the paper we will focus on the geminate  dynamics  of  the  hydrated

electron observed on a picosecond time scale after the completion of the thermalization phase.

These geminate dynamics exhibit two regimes: (i) a fast exponential decay that occurs on

the time scale of tens of picoseconds and (ii) a slower decay that occurs on sub-nanosecond time

scale. At 25  oC, the overall time profile can be simulated using a biexponential law (e.g., Fig.

2(a)). However, high-temperature data given below in Fig. 3 indicate that the “tail” is actually

given by the power law, t-ν, typical of diffusion-controlled dynamics (see also Fig. 1S; hereafter,

extension  "S"  refers  to  the  figures  placed  in  the  Supporting  Information).  Similar  bimodal

kinetics (the initial fast exponential decay succeeded by a much slower diffusional decay) were

observed in several other CTTS photosystems, such as halide anions in water [3-7] and sodide

anions in ethers [8,9,11].

For pump fluences available with our experimental setup (< 2.5x10-2 J/cm2), the geminate

kinetics showed no dependence on the pump power (see the comparison shown in Fig. 2(a)). The

photoinduced 800 nm absorbance observed 10 ps after the 200 nm pulse linearly increased with

the photon fluence. The photometric measurement of the quantum yield (QY) of rxn. (1) details

of which are given elsewhere [45] gave 0.342±0.08 at t=5 ps; this estimate agrees well with the

estimates obtained by ultrafast actinometry, assuming unity QY for electron detachment in 200

nm photoexcitation of aqueous ferrocyanide [46]. Using the biexponential fit shown in Fig. 2(a),

11

we estimate that the prompt electron yield (for  t → 0 ) in photoreaction (1) is ca. 0.38 and the

free  electron  yield  (for  t → ∞)  is  ca.  0.09.  The  latter  estimate  is  close  to  0.11  obtained  by

Dainton and Fowles [31] for 185 nm photoexcitation and Iwata et al. [32] and Sauer et al. [47]

for 193 nm photoexcitation. The prompt electron yield of 0.38 for 200 nm photoexcitation of

OH- compares well with such yields for other pseudohalides (cf. 0.33 for HS- and 0.30 for CNS-

[45]); note that these QY’s are considerably lower than the near unity values for halides (0.9 for

I- and 0.91 for Br- [45,48]).

Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show a family of 200 nm pump – 800 nm probe kinetics obtained for

56  mM  KOH  solution  at  several  temperatures  ranging  from  8  to  97  oC.  Since  the  fast  decay

phase  due  to  thermalization  of  the  hydrated  electron  becomes  less  pronounced  at  higher

temperature, these kinetics were normalized at 5 ps, when this thermalization is over. It is clear

that the escape fraction of the electron systematically increases with the temperature (Fig. 3(b)).

Fig. 3(c) shows that the ratio of the optical densities at 550 ps and 5 ps linearly increases with the

temperature. A linear increase in the QY of free electron (estimated from photoproduct analysis)

with temperature has been observed by Jortner and coworkers for 254 nm photolysis of iodide

[49]. Our ultrafast kinetic measurement suggests that this increase is primarily due to an increase

in the survival probability of the geminate pairs.

Remarkably, the time profile of the “tail” does not change with the temperature: In Fig.

1S the plateau value attained at the longest delay time was subtracted from the kinetic traces and

the resulting difference traces were normalized at 50 ps. Regardless of the sample temperature,

all six kinetics exhibit the same asymptotic behavior. This behavior is expected from the model

discussed in section IV.A.

12

The kinetics shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 were obtained at [OH-] that was sufficiently low so

that the transformation of OH radical into O- occurred after the first 600 ps shown in the kinetic

plots.  Surprisingly,  much  the  same  (normalized)  kinetics  were  obtained  in  the  concentrated

alkaline  solutions  for  which  rxn.  (3)  was  much  faster  (Fig.  4).  As  the  concentration  of  OH-

increases into the molar range, the penetration depth of the 200 nm light becomes very short: ca.

1 µm for 5 M solution – and the signal-to-noise suffers due to instability in the jet surface. Still,

within  the  confidence  limits  of  our  kinetic  measurements  (Fig.  4(a)),  the  normalized  traces

obtained in 0.1, 1, 4.8, and 9.74 M solutions of KOH look the same, except for small changes in

the thermalization dynamics of the electron. This insensitivity to concentration (or ionic strength)

will be considered in the Discussion (section IV.B).

B. Biphotonic excitation of OH-.

In  this  section  we  demonstrate  that  1  x  200  nm  and  2  x  389  nm  photoexcitation  of

aqueous  OH-  yields  qualitatively  different  electron  dynamics  despite  the  fact  that  the  total

excitation energies are almost the same.

Since water itself can be ionized by simultaneous absorption of three 400 nm photons

[34,50], 2-photon excitation of OH- always competes with this ionization. We refer the reader to

the  Appendix  and  Figs.  2S,  3S,  and  4S  in  the  Supporting  Information  for  more  detail  on  the

photophysics of this competition. As shown therein, provided that the 2-photon quantum yield

for electron photodetachment from OH- is unity, the 2 x 400 nm molar absorption coefficient for

OH- is very low, ca. 3.8 cm TW-1 M-1. A simple calculation shows that to observe the 2-photon

process exclusively, the pump irradiance should be < 50 GW/cm2 (for 2 M OH- solution). At that

low irradiance, photoinduced electron absorbance in a 150 µm jet is less than 10 µOD. As it was

13

not possible to study the kinetic behavior for such a small signal using the 1 KHz Ti:sapphire

system at Argonne, these measurements were carried out with the USC system, using a 1 mm

optical path flow cell.

It was determined that the 650 nm transient absorption signal increased roughly as the

square of the 389 nm light irradiance (Fig. 5(c)). At the lower end of the available range, the

kinetic  profiles  were  independent  of  the  photon  flux.  Therefore,  these  kinetics  resulted  from

biphotonic excitation of hydroxide anion in water. These 389 nm traces notably differed from the

400 nm traces obtained at the higher pump irradiance (> 200 GW/cm2) at Argonne. In particular,

the  latter  always  showed  a  contribution  from  the  diffuse  geminate  pairs  generated  via  water

photoionization. This contribution is easily discernable on the semilogarithmic plots shown in

Fig. 4S(b).

Fig. 5(a) shows a comparison between the 200 nm (1-photon) and the 389 nm (2-photon)

kinetics for OH-. To facilitate the comparison, the kinetic traces were normalized at 5 ps. The

solid  lines  are  biexponential  least-squares  fits  in  which  the  time  constants  for  both  of  the

components  were  the  same,  but  the  relative  weight  of  these  two  components  varied.  This

comparison suggests that (i) the same fast and slow components are observed in both types of

photoexcitation, albeit in a different ratio, and (ii) the main difference between these kinetics is a

higher fraction of escaped electrons for the 2-photon excitation. As argued in section IV.B, these

trends can be rationalized assuming that the initial radial distribution of the electrons in the 2-

photon excitation is relatively broad.

In addition to the 389 nm pump - 650 nm probe experiment examined above, a 337 nm

pump  -  650  nm  probe  experiment  on  1  M  OH-  was  carried  out  at  USC  (Fig.  5(b)).  After

normalization at 5 ps, these kinetics look identical to the 2 x 389 nm kinetics shown in Fig. 5(b),

14

within the experimental scatter. The small difference could be due to the residual signal from eaq

-

generated by water photoionization. At 337 nm, the biphotonic photoionization of water is still

inefficient (the onset of the action spectrum is placed at 316 nm [37]). The 2-photon coefficient

for absorption of 337 nm photons by OH- must be very low because even for 1 M NaOH solution

and irradiance of 7 GW/cm2, 3-photon ionization of water still contributed 5-7% of the electron

absorbance at 650 nm. The fraction of escaped electrons generated in the 2 x 389 and 2 x 337 nm

photoprocesses (with total energies of 6.2 and 7.4 eV, respectively) are 1.8 times higher than the

same fraction in single 200 nm photon excitation.

A. Geminate dynamics for (OH:eaq

-) pairs and diffusion-controlled reactions in a potential

The salient feature of monovalent CTTS photosystems is the formation of a geminate pair

inside  a  solvent  cage  in  which  the  residual  radical/atom  and  the  electron  weakly  attract  each

other. [7] The formation of such a cage is not prerequisite: it has been observed for halide anions

in  water  [3-7]  and  sodide  anions  in  ethers  [8,9],  whereas  electron  photodetachment  from

polyvalent  anions,  such  as  ferrocyanide,  sulfite,  and  sulfate  does  not  seem  to  involve  cage

formation, but rather long range ejection of the electron. [45,46] The fast exponential regime

observed  in  the  geminate  dynamics  of  "caged"  pairs  corresponds  to  their  escape  from  and

recombination in the cage, whereas the power "tail" is due to slow re-encounters of the electrons

that escape from the cage and their geminate partners. [4] Such a picture broadly agrees with

optical spectroscopy data and quantum molecular dynamics simulations. [2,51,52,53]

Consider a solvated electron diffusing in a radially-symmetric potential field U(r)=kT

u(r) and recombining with its geminate partner at reaction radius r=d. The mean force potential

U(r) mimics the attractive and repulsive forces that exist between the electron and its geminate

partner. Such a field can be directly obtained from quantum mechanical - molecular dynamics

models  of  electron  photodetachment.  [53]  In  the  following,  we  will  assume  that  the

concentration of the excitation events is sufficiently low that cross-recombination of species that

belong  to  different  pairs  can  be  neglected.  In  such  a  case,  the  Laplace  transform  Ω(s)  of  the

survival probability Ω(t) for the geminate pair is given by

where J(d;s) is the Laplace transform of the diffusional flux through the reaction sphere at r=d

of  electron  escape  is,  in  the  general  case,  a  function  of  the  initial  distribution  P(ri)  of  the

electrons around its geminate partner. Thus, to account for the observed temperature dependence

(5)

(6)

of the kinetic profiles, one needs to postulate a temperature-dependent distribution P(ri).  Our

analysis, in which trial distributions P(ri) were generated and Ω(t) given by eq. (8) compared

with the observed kinetic traces, showed that no choice of this distribution can yield the observed

recombination dynamics. We conclude, in agreement with previous studies of halide CTTS, [4,6]

that free diffusion cannot explain the observed recombination dynamics for electron-radical pairs

generated  in  electron  photodetachment  from  monovalent  anions.  The  fast  exponential  decay

observed  within  the  first  few  tens  of  picoseconds  after  the  excitation  suggests  that  there  is  a

relatively strong interaction between the geminate partners at short distances (3-7 Å), whereas

pronounced temperature dependence of  Ω∞  indicates that there is a weak attractive potential at

large separation distances, where the diffusion is almost free.

The analysis of non-homogeneous geminate recombination kinetics in more general cases

of finite reaction rates at the reaction radius and diffusion within an interaction potential can be

tackled  through  a  variety  of  approaches,  including  competitive  kinetic  models [53] involving

different  spatial  sub-populations,  [11]  analytic  and  semi-analytic  theories  [54-57]  and  full

numerical solution of the diffusion equation. [4,58] In each case, the initial spatial distribution of

the generated pairs plays a key role. Two of these approaches have so far been investigated for

modeling the recombination dynamics in geminate pairs formed in CTTS reactions. Bradforth

and coworkers used a full numerical solution of the Smoluchowski equation [58] for electron

diffusion in a potential field that allows an arbitrary form for P(ri) and U(r) as well as a finite

contact reaction rate for the reverse electron transfer reaction. Schwartz and coworkers [8,9] (see

also ref. [59]) used a two-state model in which the geminate pairs were divided into close and

distant  ones;  the  former  pairs  were  assumed  to  stay  together  and  decay  by  first  order

recombination or dissociation on a picosecond time scale, whereas the second type of pairs were

17

assumed  to  slowly  migrate  apart  on  a  sub-nanosecond  time  scale.  Schwartz  and  coworkers

identify the close pairs as “contact" or "immediate" pairs in which the excess electron density

envelops the geminate partner, and the distant pairs as “solvent-separated” or free pairs in which

the  electron  is  shielded  from  the  partner  by  one  or  more  solvent  molecules.  These  close  and

distant  pairs  have  the  same  spectral  properties  but  exhibit  different  recombination  dynamics

when the electron is promoted by absorption of a NIR photon. [8] These two models are not

mutually exclusive, because the dynamics of distant pairs becomes diffusional at longer delay

times. Implicit in the model suggested by Bradforth and coworkers [4] is that the motion of the

electron along the reaction coordinate is purely diffusional and stays so to the point when the

geminate partners recombine at the reaction radius.

Below we give a model for geminate dynamics in CTTS photosystems that is based on

the  semianalytical  theory  for  diffusion-controlled  reactions  in  a  potential  well  developed  by

Shushin. [55,56,57]  This  model  has  a  number  of  advantages  in  that  an  explicit  form  for  the

potential is not required and it includes the diffusion dynamics. In this model, diffusion-driven

escape  from  a  potential  well  is  treated  as  an  equilibrium  between  the  population  in  the  well

(d<r<a, where a is the Onsager radius at which |u(a)|=1), in which the attraction is strong, and

in  the  potential  “tail”  (r>a),  where  this  attraction  is  negligible.  Shushin’s  equations  can  be

derived  using  either  a  two-state  equilibrium  model  [55]  or  a  perturbation  treatment  of  the

diffusion  equation  [56].  In  both  of  these  treatments,  the  “hard”  recombination  radius  r=d  is

interpreted as the location of the potential barrier between the geminate pair and the product of

recombination. Assuming that the well is sufficiently deep (that is, at the potential minimum,

r=re, ue=-u(re)>1), Shushin showed that

few  picoseconds,  during  the  electron  thermalization  (a  similar  assumption  was  made  in

simulating  the  electron  -  iodine  recombination  numerically,  [4]  by  letting  ri≈ re,  and  this

Shushin obtained an expansion of function M(α;τ) in the powers of a small parameter

α  [56a]. Unlike eq. (17), this expansion is correct for α<0.3  only. It is easy to demonstrate, that

 (Fig. 5S). Both of

these behaviors are consistent with our experimental observations. The dimensionless parameter

α  is,  therefore,  a  measure  of  how  rapidly  the  exponential  decay  is  replaced  by  the  diffusion

regime due to slow re-encounters of the geminate partners; this parameter depends only on the

shape of the attractive potential U(r).

It can be argued from very general principles [58] that the expansion of w(s) in powers of

s   given  by  eq.  (10)  is  always  correct  for  small  Laplace  parameters  s,  though  the  actual

coefficients may differ between the theories. Importantly, empirical estimates for Wr can be used

instead of the estimate given by eqs. (12) and (13), as suggested in ref. [56a]. In particular, eq.

(12) corresponds to diffusive motion across the reaction barrier, which seems unlikely for the

system in question (see below).

  are  independent  of  the

and the well depth. The time profile of the geminate kinetics is uniquely defined by these three

model parameters or, - if the diffusion coefficient D is known, - by Wr, Wd, and a. Additionally,

the  reaction  constant  K∞  for  recombination  in  the  bulk  (extrapolated  to  t = ∞ )  is  given  by

K

is the effective reaction radius. [57] At 25 oC, the diffusion coefficients are 4.5x10-5 cm2/s for the

electron and 2.8x10-5 cm2/s for the OH radical, respectively, so that D=0.73 Å2/ps and Reff=5.43

Å. The least-squares fit of picosecond kinetics shown in Fig. 6(a) gives pd=0.173, α=0.381, and

W-1=12.75 ps (or W/D=0.107 Å-2). Fig. 3(b) shows the least-squares fits for kinetics obtained at

higher temperatures. Fig. 7 shows the optimum model parameters plotted as a function of the

temperature. No provision was made to take into account rxn. (3), whose rate increases with the

temperature,  because  the  concentration  of  hydroxide  was  too  low  (56  mM)  to  observe

deprotonation of OH on the time scale of 600 ps, even at 97 oC [16].

Assuming that the recombination in the well is driven by diffusion alone (eq. (12)) and

taking d from u(d)=0, we sought the empirical potential

that gives the best agreement with dimensionless parameters W/D, pd, and α, that depend only on

this model potential. To this end, a genetic algorithm for optimization of the parameters ε0, R0, n

and m in eq. (19) was implemented; the additional constraint was to match the experimental Reff.

The following optimum parameters were obtained: ε0=8.34 (which corresponds to a well depth

21

of 2.43 kT), R0=2.06 Å (that corresponds to a potential minimum at 2.8 Å), n=4.77 (repulsion)

and  m=2.1  (attraction).  This  set  of  parameters  yields  a=6.76  Å,  lr=32  Å,  pd=0.174, α=0.378,

Z=377 Å3, W/D=0.103 Å-1, and Reff=5.6 Å. The effective potential thus obtained (shown in Fig.

6(b)) resembles in the well depth the model potential obtained in numerical simulation for the

(I:eaq

-)  pairs  by  Kloepfer  et  al. [4]  Using  this  potential,  one  can  inquire  whether  the  same

potential  form  can  be  used  to  fit  the  kinetic  data  obtained  at  a  higher  temperature  since

u(r)=U(r)/kT can be scaled and thus a “temperature dependence” of dimensionless parameters

D/W, pd, and α obtained. For the potential shown in Fig. 6(b), a small increase in the absolute

temperature (10-40%) results in a linear increase in pd and α  and W/D (Fig. 6S). These trends

are in agreement with our observations for the (OH:eaq

-) pair (Fig. 7); however, the experimental

temperature dependencies for these parameters are much steeper (Fig. 7). Furthermore, we found

that  potentials  (19)  which  yield  the  best  match  to  the  parameters  W/D,  pd,  and  α  at  higher

temperature (60-97 oC) are shallow (< kT) and diffuse (m<1.5). Note that even the estimate of m≈

2 at 25 oC is unrealistic: the mean force potential is likely to be more compact. Furthermore, the

basic premise of Shushin's theory is that the potential depth ue is greater than kT, and the shallow

potential means that this theory is inapplicable. Thus, it appears that within the framework of

Shushin's theory, no reasonable mean force potential can explain the data for the (OH:eaq

-) pair.

This conclusion, however, relates to our initial assumption that the reaction rate Wr is given by

eq. (12), i.e., this reaction is due to diffusion-controlled crossing over the potential barrier. When

this assumption is rejected, self-consistency is regained.

In Fig. 8(b), the two rate constants Wr and Wd are plotted vs. 1/T. This plot indicates that

the activation energy for dissociation from the potential well, 22.3±0.9 kJ/mol, is very close to

the activation energy for electron diffusion, 20.5±0.2 kJ/mol (Fig. 7S) [60]. The same point is

22

illustrated by the plot of Wd/De as a function of the temperature in Fig. 8(b), where De  is  the

diffusion coefficient for hydrated electron [60]. On the other hand, the activation energy for the

recombination constant, Wr, is much lower, 8.3±1 kJ/mol (which is equivalent to ca. 3 kT at 25

oC).  Apparently,  while  the  dissociation  of  the  (OH:eaq

-)  pair  is  diffusion  controlled,  the

recombination of "caged" partners is not. The activation energy for Wr  compares well with 7.9

kJ/mol obtained for rxn. (2) in the bulk, by Elliot and Ouellette (18-150 oC) [16].

Assuming  that  the  diffusion  coefficient  De  of  the  electron  accounts  for  the  largest

contribution to D (i.e., neglecting the OH diffusion), the Onsager radius a of the potential can be

estimated using eq. (16) (Fig. 8(a)). This radius increases linearly with temperature from ca. 5 Å

at 8 oC to ca. 7 Å at 97 oC, suggesting that the potential of the mean force becomes more diffuse

at higher temperature. The reaction radius Reff  estimated using eq. (18) is given in Fig. 8(a); this

radius is independent of temperature since the increase in a is cancelled by the decrease in the

probability 1-pd  of  the  reaction.  The  model,  therefore,  predicts  that  bulk  rxn. (2)  is  diffusion

controlled, contrary to the results of ref. [16]. It is not presently clear, whether this discrepancy is

significant.  The  estimates  by  Elliot  and  Ouellette  [16]  were  obtained  from  a  global  fit  to  a

complex kinetic scheme that involved >5 other reactions occurring on the same time scale. On

the other hand, our simulations neglected a possible temperature effect on the initial electron

distribution, which may be significant.

B. Concentration effects and CTTS photophysics.

We turn now to the unanticipated observations made in section III, viz. (i) the constancy

of  the  geminate  decay  kinetics  as  a  function  of  [OH-]  and  (ii)  the  fact  that  1-  and  2-photon

photodetachment yield different decay kinetics at nearly the same total excitation energies.

23

The constancy of the geminate recombination profile observed with concentration in Fig.

4 is remarkable, because these 4.8 M and 9.74 M OH- solutions are, respectively 21% and 40%,

denser and 1.6 and 3.4 times more viscous than pure water. Based on the Stokes law, one would

expect  to  observe  considerably  slower  electron  diffusion  and  thereby  slower  geminate

recombination of the (OH:eaq

-) pair. Another factor expected to reduce the diffusion rate is the

drag of the slowly-migrating ionic atmosphere on the rapidly-migrating electron, – a well known

effect  in  electrochemistry  that  is  observed  for  all  mobile  ions  in  less  concentrated  electrolyte

solutions  [61,62].  The  interaction  with  this  atmosphere  also  increases  charge  screening  that

reduces  the  attraction  between  the  geminate  partners.  (Large  effects  of  ionic  strength  on  rate

constants  for  reactions  of  hydrated  electrons  with  charged  species  have  been  observed  and

accounted for via this screening effect. [62,63]  Furthermore, assuming that rxn. (3) occurs with

rate constant of 1.3x1010 M-1 s-1, the conversion of OH to O- in a 1-5 M alkaline solution would

occur in 20-90 ps which is well within our observation window of 600 ps. Given that pKa for the

OH radical is ca. 12 [18], in these concentrated solutions the equilibrium concentration of OH is

negligible (and, in any case, the backward reaction is too slow to be observed on the picosecond

time scale). [19,20,21] We conclude that despite the ongoing transformation of the (OH:eaq

-) pair

into the (O-:eaq

-) pair, no concomitant change in the electron dynamics is observed.

For photodetachment from iodide, similar effects of both reactivity of the detached parent

and the ionic atmosphere are in play.  The iodine atom generated from iodide adds to I- with rate

constant  of  (0.88-1.2)x1010 M-1  s-1. [64]  This  rate  constant  is  close  to  that  for  rxn.  (3).  The

resulting dimer radical anion, I2

-, absorbs strongly near 400 nm and in the near infrared. [65] Its

formation has indeed been observed probing at 400 nm with the expected kinetics. [66a] The

delayed formation of I2

- on the subnanosecond time scale should also distort the "tails" of the

24

solvated electron kinetics observed at [I-] > 0.1 M. Furthermore, there is no a priori reason to

believe that (I:eeq

-) pairs exhibit the same recombination/dissociation dynamics as (I2

-:eaq

-) pairs.

Nevertheless, experiments carried out in Bradforth’s group show that the electron kinetics do not

change when [I-] changes from 1 mM to 0.2 M, [6,66b] much like the kinetics for OH- given in

section III.A. Particularly as the I2

- formation appears to follow the expected kinetics, this result

is also surprising.

The  following  qualitative  explanation  may  account  for  the  observed  constancy  of  the

kinetic profiles with the alkali concentration. Let us first neglect the ionic strength effects and

focus  on  the  chemical  transformation  of  the  radical.  According  to  Shushin's  theory,  such  a

transformation would be negligible provided that this transformation occurs on the time scale t

for which Wt>>1. In this regime, the geminate partners do not interact and, therefore, even if

one of the partners undergoes a transformation this does not change the recombination dynamics.

Since typical W-1 are 10-15 ps, one needs decamolar concentration of the anions to interfere with

the geminate dynamics of the electron inside the potential well. Even at this high concentration,

the actual changes for the hydroxide system may be negligible because OH and O- have similar

reaction constants, and the escape probabilities for the corresponding pairs must be similar. As

for the anticipated ionic strength effect on the electron diffusion, this effect requires that the ionic

atmosphere  rapidly  readjusts  itself  as  the  electron  migrates.  In  the  Debye-Hückel  theory  of

aqueous  electrolytes  (applicable  to  ionic  concentrations  <  0.1  M),  the  relaxation  time  for  the

ionic atmosphere is 55/[ion] ps, [62] where [ion] is the molar concentration of monovalent ions,

i.e., at the upper limit of validity of this theory, it takes the atmosphere ca. 500 ps to relax. [62]

This  time  is  too  long.  Even  if  the  relaxation  time  continues  to  decrease  with  [OH-]  in

concentrated alkaline solutions (and this trend is opposed by the decrease in cation diffusion and

25

ion  pairing),  it  still  takes  extremely  large  concentrations  of  the  electrolyte  to  reduce  this

relaxation time to the time scales comparable to W-1.

As a result of these observations, a detailed study of ionic strength effects on electron

radical recombination reactions has been conducted [67]. In addition, separate experiments that

tracked the 266 nm absorbance of OH radical as a function of the initial OH- concentration were

carried out. [68] That latter study suggested that forward rxn. (3) slows down considerably in

concentrated alkaline solutions. We direct the reader to refs. [67] and [68] for a full discussion of

the problems. For our purposes, it is significant that sub-nanosecond recombination chemistry is

invariant  to  [OH-]  (and,  more  generally,  the  ionic  strength  of  the  solution  [67])  as  it  allows

comparison of the one- and two- photon initiated detachment reactions.

The first major difference in the 1- and 2-photon excitation of hydroxide is that the 2-

photon detachment process appears to be extremely inefficient (section  III.B).    The  2-photon

efficiency for electron photodetachment from OH-  at  400  nm  is  35  times  lower  than  that  for

iodide at the same wavelength (see refs. [69] and [70]). This efficiency factor involves both the

two-photon cross-section for absorption and the prompt yield of electrons upon excitation. This

large difference may indicate that 2-photon CTTS of OH- is a forbidden photoprocess. In the gas

phase,  the  ground  state  OH-  anion  has  Σ  representation  whereas  the  OH  radical  has  Π

representation  [24,71].  The  first  excited  electronic  state  ( A  2Σ + )  of  the  OH  radical  can  be

excluded from consideration because it has > 4 eV higher energy than the ground state [71]. To

conserve the projection of the orbital momentum on the OH axis, the electron wave should be s-

or d- for 1-photon detachment and p- or f- for 2-photon detachment. [72] The role of the electron

wave  symmetry  and  orbital  momentum  conservation  in  1-photon  CTTS  dynamics  has  been

26

recently studied by Schwartz and coworkers, [73] and we address the reader to their theoretical

work for more detail.

Two  possible  explanations  can  be  given  to  account  for  inefficient  biphotonic  electron

detachment from OH-. The choice between these two explanations depends on whether the low

efficiency constitutes an anomaly or the rule, and that is not yet known. In the first scenario, the

generation of a p-wave electron from the OH- is viewed as a low-probability event because it

requires a fortuitous orientation of the OH radical and a figure-eight cavity that stabilizes the

outer  lobes  of  the  CTTS  p-function.  Since  both  atoms  in  the  parent  OH-  anion  are  hydrogen

bonded to water molecules, it is unlikely that such a "cavity" can form in the direction that is

required to compensate for the orbital momentum of the Π  state. Indeed, molecular dynamics

calculations [13],  IR-Raman  studies  of  alkaline  solutions  (see  a  review  in  ref.  [15])  and  OH-

(H2O)nArm clusters (e.g., [12]) suggest that the O atom is strongly hydrogen bonded to 3-4 water

molecules. Such a rigid structure leaves little room for the cavity formation. In this scenario, the

low yield of 2-photon CTTS for OH- is due to strong hydrogen bonding.

An entirely different rationale has been suggested by Schwartz [74]. In that scenario, the

orbital symmetry disfavors 2-photon CTTS for all nearly-spherical anions, including the OH- and

iodide  anions.  However,  for  the  latter,  spin-orbital  interaction  relaxes  the  orbital  momentum

conservation and makes 2-photon CTTS more favorable. In such a case, heavier, larger anions

would possess larger cross sections for electron detachment than smaller, lighter anions. Only

further  study  can  establish  which  one  of  these  factors,  hydrogen  bonding  or  spin-orbital

interaction, is responsible for the observed difference between the OH- and the I-. In particular, a

systematic  study  on  the  dependence  of  2-photon  cross  sections  and  quantum  yields  for

pseudohalides and halides is needed to obtain the general pattern.

27

However small is the probability for 2-photon induced electron detachment from OH-,

when  this  photoreaction  occurs,  the  initial  radial  distribution  of  hydrated  electrons  may  be

different  from  that  attained  in  1-photon  rxn.  (1),  as  these  localized  species  originate  from

electron  waves  of  different  symmetry.  Below,  we  argue  that  in  the  framework  of  Shushin's

theory, the difference between the kinetics shown in Fig. 5(a) can be understood in terms of a

broader radial distribution of the electrons for biphotonic excitation. This distribution extends

over the Onsager radius a of the potential thereby increasing the escape fraction of the electrons.

Using the equilibrium model of ref. [55], the Laplace transform n(s)  of  the  population  of  the

.  As  shown  in  Fig. 9(b),  a  decrease  in  υ  (broader electron distribution)

results in kinetics that are similar to trace (ii) in Fig. 5(a): the escape fraction  Ω∞  increases and

the weight of the fast component decreases with the increase in υ. The best match between the

simulated and experimental kinetic profiles is for υ  ≈ 3, at which  r

≈  (Fig. 9(a)). Thus, the

a

i

biphotonic kinetics can be interpreted in terms of an initial electron distribution with the mean

distance equal to the Onsager radius of the mean force potential that is estimated to be 5-6 Å for

the given pair. A similar approach has been recently used by us to explain the difference between

the recombination kinetics for electron detached from iodide by 200 nm and >225 nm light: both

sets of the kinetics can be simulated assuming the same dynamic parameters and mean force

potential;  the  only  difference  seems  to  be  a  broader  electron  distribution  in  200  nm

photoexcitation [45].  It  is  noteworthy  that  the  excitation  energy  dependence  for  the  geminate

kinetics observed by Barthel and Schwartz in electron detachment from sodide in THF [11] can

also be interpreted in the same way, as systematic broadening of the electron distribution. It must

be stressed that the scenarios considered above are speculative and need to be explored using

molecular dynamics and quantum mechanical calculations.

The observations of differing geminate recombination with photoelectron ejection range

provide an explanation for the difference between the current CTTS detachment results and those

published in earlier work by Eisenthal and coworkers. [33] These authors report rapid generation

29

of eaq

- in 313 nm laser photolysis of aqueous OH-. The excitation was either bi- or tri- photonic,

and picosecond kinetics of the electron decay resembled those for photoionization of neat water,

with an escape fraction of the electron of 70% attained at a delay time of 70 ps. Although the

kinetics reported here for hydroxide when resonantly excited into its CTTS band (section III)

look  different  from  that  reported  in  ref.  [33],  the  latter  are  consistent  with  preliminary

measurements made at USC using 300 nm two-photon excitation of concentrated alkali solution.

Once 8.3 eV is deposited into the photosystem, the electron is ejected to a much longer distance

and may be directly coupled to the water conduction band. [10,45]

C. Implications for water photolysis and radiolysis.

As mentioned in the Introduction, one of the main motivations for studying hydroxide

CTTS  is  the  fact  that  geminate  pairs  of  OH  and  electron  also  occur  in  photo-  and  radiation

induced ionization of liquid water:

(25)

According to numerous studies (e.g., refs. [34-39]), geminate decay of the electron generated in

rxn. (25) proceeds mainly via. rxn. (2), though electron recombination with the hydronium ion

also contributes to the electron decay (ca. 18% of recombination events at 25 oC [38]). The usual

approach to the simulation of the ensuing dynamics is to assume free diffusion and to use the so-

called  independent  reaction  time  (IRT)  model.  [75]  The  alternative  approach  is  to  perform

Monte-Carlo simulations; [75] in any case, no attraction or caging between the OH radical and

the electron is assumed.

30

Our results suggest that this approach may be incorrect since hydroxide CTTS yields a

pair whose geminate dynamics indicates such an attraction, and similar dynamics were observed

for other electron - radical pairs. [2-11] This weak attraction is not specific to the pairs that are

generated via the CTTS process, i.e., it cannot be related to the nature of the solvent cage that is

formed in this photoprocess or a "memory" about the water structure around the parent anion.

Indeed, the effects of such an interaction can be traced out to 50-100 ps. It seems unlikely that

any specific configuration of water molecules around the OH radical or its parent anion would

survive  for  that  long  period  of  time.  The  observation  of  chemically  induced  electron  spin

polarization in the CTTS photosystems by Fessenden and coworkers [76] and Bussandri and van

Willigen  [77]  also  suggests  that  caging  occurs  even  in  random  encounters  of  radicals  with

electrons,  as  otherwise  no  spin  exchange  would  be  possible  in  such  pairs  due  to  their  rapid

recombination. [78] While the exact mechanism by which the attraction between the OH radical

and eaq

- arises is not presently clear, its very existence contradicts the basic assumptions of the

IRT and Monte-Carlo simulations.

Why was this cage formation not observed before? As explained in the previous section,

the degree by which the fast exponential component that corresponds to escape from the cage

can  be  discerned  from  the  geminate  kinetics  depends  on  the  width  of  the  initial  electron

distribution. For hydroxide CTTS, υ   >  3  (section IV.B). For 2 x 266 nm or 3 x 400 nm [34]

photon  ionization  of  water,  r
i

≈ −9 10  

Å

  and  υ   ≈  1.6.  For  ionization  using  high  energy

photons and in radiolytic spurs,  r
i

≈

−20 30  

Å

  [34]  and  υ   <  0.6.  Examination  of  Fig. 9(b)

shows how difficult it is to discern the exponential component in the last two cases. Additionally,

31

hydrated electron interacts and recombines with the hydronium ion, and that further biases the

resulting kinetics towards agreement with the free diffusion prescription.

Recently, Laubereau and coworkers suggested that contact (OH:eaq

-) pairs are generated

in 2 x 273 nm photoionization of water and asserted that such pairs account for a short-lived (ca.

100 fs) absorbance near the fundamental OH stretch of water [39]. According to their reaction

scheme,  photoionization  of  water  proceeds  through  the  formation  of  a  hydronium  ion  and  an

"electronically excited OH-"  anion  which  rapidly  dissociates  to  a  contact  (OH:eaq

-)  pair.  The

short-lived 2-5 µm absorbance is thought to be from the OH stretch of a hydroxyl radical that

interacts with the electron in the same cavity.

Our results do not support such a scenario. "Electronically excited OH-" and its partially

dissociated state that are invoked by Laubereau  and  coworkers [39] would yield a CTTS-like

(OH:eaq

-) pair with short separation between the OH radical and the electron. Such a pair would

exhibit  the  characteristic  time  profile  of  electron  decay  that  was  observed  in  our  transient

absorption  dynamics  for  hydroxide  CTTS.  The  energetics  are  also  unfavorable.  The  total

excitation  energy  of  2  x  273  nm  photoexcitation  is  9.1  eV  and  >  0.83  eV  of  this  energy  is

consumed to break the H-O bond of water and solvate the resulting proton. [34] Thus, the OH-

fragment has at most 8.3 eV of the excess energy, which is close to the threshold energy of 8.45

eV for the OH- photoemission (into the gas phase) [28]. This energy is only 0.9 eV higher than

the  energy  absorbed  by  OH-  in  2  x  337  nm  (7.4  eV)  photoexcitation,  which  yielded  the

characteristic bimodal kinetics shown in Fig. 5(b). No bound excited states of OH- in water other

than its 6.6 and 7.44 eV CTTS states are known [25].

V. CONCLUSION

32

One-  (200  nm)  and  two-  (337  and  389  nm)  photon  induced  electron  detachment  from

aqueous OH- have been studied on the picosecond time scale. In both of these cases, geminate

decay kinetics for the hydrated electron are bimodal, with a fast exponential component (ca. 13

ps) and a slower "tail" due to diffusional escape of the electrons on the sub-nanosecond time

scale.  For  biphotonic  excitation,  the  extrapolated  escape  fraction  of  the  electron  is  1.8  times

higher than for monophotonic excitation (31% vs. 17.3% at 25 oC, respectively). We speculate

that  this  difference  is  due  to  the  broader  electron  distribution  attained  in  the  biphotonic

excitation. The prompt quantum yield of the 200 nm photodetachment is ca. 0.38 for hydroxide

vs. 0.9 for iodide. [45] The two-photon excitation of CTTS at 400 nm is 35 times less efficient

than that of the aqueous iodide.

Picosecond electron dynamics observed in the monophotonic excitation of the CTTS of

OH- were studied as a function of [OH-] and the temperature. The temperature effect (studied

over the temperature interval of 8-to-90 oC) is mainly in the increase of the escape fraction of the

electrons (ca. 3x10-3 per oK) and faster recombination (with activation energy of 8.3 kJ/mol) and

diffusion-controlled dissociation (with activation energy of 22.3 kJ/mol) of the geminate pairs in

the  potential  well.  The  activation  energy  for  recombination  of  caged  eaq

-  and  OH  radical

compares well with 7.9 kJ/mol obtained for rxn. (2) in the bulk.  No concentration dependence

was  observed,  from  10  mM  to  10  M.  Neither  the  ionic  strength  effects  (due  to  the  charge

screening and the drag of the ionic atmosphere) nor the effect of ongoing rxn. (3) were observed

on the sub-nanosecond time scale. This result is surprising, and is the subject of an extensive

parallel study [67,68].

The  picosecond  kinetics  were  simulated  in  a  model  where  the  electron  migrates  by

diffusion and interacts with its geminate partner by means of a weak attractive potential. The

33

semianalytical theory of Shushin was used to model the geminate dynamics. These simulations

suggest  that  the  mean  force  potential  becomes  more  diffuse  at  higher  temperature,  with  the

Onsager radius linearly increasing from 5 Å at 8 oC to 7 Å at 97 oC. This trend is consistent with

the  notion  that  the  potential  is  mainly  due  to  H-bonding  of  water  molecules  in  the  solvation

shells rather than direct electrostatic interaction of the geminate partners.

Our results suggest that dynamic models for photoionization of water should be revised

to  include  this  weak  interaction  of  photogenerated  electron  with  the  OH  radical.  Such  an

interaction  is  directly  observed  in  the  geminate  pairs  generated  via  1-  and  2-photon  induced

photodetachment from OH-;  there  is  no  reason  to  expect  that  it  is  lacking  for  the  same  pairs

generated  via  water  ionization.  On  the  other  hand,  our  results  do  not  support  the  recent

suggestion by Laubereau and coworkers [39] that contact (OH:eaq

-) pairs are generated in water

photoionization  and  yield  the  short-lived  absorbance  in  the  2-5  µm  region  [39].  This

photoinduced  change  in  the  IR  light  transmission  originates  from  species  other  than  the  OH

radical; perhaps, from the water itself.

(a)  Transient  absorption  kinetics  obtained  in  200  nm  pump  (320  fs  FWHM)  -  800  nm  (50  fs
FWHM) probe experiments on 9.8, 56, and 98 mM aqueous solutions of KOH (150 µm jet; 200
nm photon fluence of 1.6x10-2 J/cm2). These kinetics are normalized at the maximum and given

on logarithmic time scale. Only hydrated electron absorbs at 800 nm. The vertical bars represent
95% confidence limits for each data point. For the lowest OH- concentration, the maximum ∆OD
signal was ca. 6x10-3; the signal from 2-photon ionization of the solvent was ca. 3x10-4. For the
other two solutions, the maximum signals were 3x10-2 and 5.5x10-2, respectively.  (b) Transient

absorption resulting from 200 nm photoexcitation of 56 mM KOH. The probe wavelengths, viz.

650, 800, and 1000 nm, were selected from white light supercontinuum using 10 nm FWHM

interference filters. These kinetic traces were normalized at 5 ps; the dashed line corresponds to

zero absorption signal. The difference in each trace during the earliest phase is due to rapid blue

shift in the electron spectrum that occurs in the course of electron thermalization (see section

III.A).

(a) Effect of the 200 nm pump power on the normalized 800 nm kinetics for hydrated electron in
98 mM aqueous KOH. Traces (i) and (ii) were obtained with 3.5 and 10  µJ excitation pulses,
respectively. The maximum ∆OD signals were 1.5x10-2 and 8.5x10-2, respectively. No change in
the  kinetics  as  a  function  of  pump  power  for  200  nm  photon  fluence  <  3x10-2  J/cm2  was

observed.  (b)  The  t=10  ps  absorbance  is  plotted  against  the  200  nm  photon  fluence.  This
dependence is linear which suggests monophotonic excitation of OH- by the pump.

(a) Temperature dependencies of the 800 nm absorbance observed in 200 nm photoexcitation of
56 mM KOH (8 to 97 oC; see (b) for the long-term kinetics). The origin of the y-axis corresponds
to zero absorption signal. The temperatures in oC are given in the color table to the right of the

plot. To facilitate the comparison, the traces were normalized in the time interval indicated with

40

a rectangle; at these delay times, the thermalization dynamics of the electron are complete (Fig.

1(b)).  These  dynamics  manifest  themselves  at  this  probe  wavelength  as  a  fast  decay  phase

observed in the first 4 ps. The amplitude of this decay decreases with the temperature because

the absorption spectrum of a thermalized electron shifts to the red and the magnitude of the blue

shift that occurs during thermalization becomes smaller. In (b), normalized 200 nm pump – 800

nm  probe  kinetics  from  56  mM  KOH  as  a  function  of  the  temperature  are  given.  The  same

kinetics,  temperatures,  and  color  coding  aplly  as  in (a).  Note  the  logarithmic  time  scale.  The

vertical bars are 95% confidence limits for each data point; solid lines are the least-squares fits
obtained using the equations given in section IV.A for υ >>1. The fit parameters are plotted in
Fig. 7. In (c), the ratio of ∆OD signals attained at 550 ps and (i) 5 ps and (ii) at the maximum are

plotted  as  a  function  of  the  temperature.  Both  of  these  quantities  (which  are  related  to  the

survival probability of the geminate pair) increase linearly with the temperature, increasing by a
factor of 3 over the 100 oC interval.

Fig. 4.

Normalized 200 nm pump (300 fs FWHM; 7 µJ; 170 µm) – 800 nm probe kinetics for 0.056,

0.99, 4.8, and 9.74 M KOH. The penetration depth of the 200 nm light was 78, 4.4, 0.9, and 0.45

µm, respectively. The concentrated alkaline solutions were prepared by adding KOH pellets to

the 0.99 N volumetric standard. The densities, bulk viscosities, and maximum ∆OD  signals for

the  0.99,  4.8,  and  9.74  M  solutions  are,  respectively,  1.05  g/cm3,  1.0  cP,  and  41  mOD,  1.21

g/cm3, 1.61 cP, and 32 mOD, and 1.4 g/cm3, 3.4 cP, and 24 mOD. While there is a small change

in the thermalization dynamics of the electron for t<5 ps, at later delay times, the kinetics do not

change with the OH- concentration (within the 95% confidence bars shown in (a)). In (b), these

bars were not shown.

– 650 nm probe (2 M NaOH) kinetics obtained in, respectively, one- and two-photon excitation
of OH-. See section III.B for more detail. The solid lines are biexponential least-squares fits in

41

which the fast and slow exponential components have the same time constants (12.4 and 83.2 ps,

respectively)  but  different  weights  and  constant  offsets  (64:16:20  [fast:slow:constant]  and

43:21:36 for traces (i) and (ii), respectively). See Fig. 9(a) for more detailed analysis using the

formulas  given  in  section  IV.  (b)  A  comparison  between  the  normalized  kinetics  obtained  in

biphotonic 389 nm (solid line) and 337 nm (open circles) photoexcitation of 2 and 1 M NaOH,

respectively. See the text for more detail. The inset (c) shows a pump intensity dependence for

the solvated electron signal recorded at 10 ps delay after the 389 nm pump pulse, using a 650 nm

probe. The double logarithmic plot of ∆OD    vs.  the  pump  irradiance  yields  the  photon  order

n=1.86.

(a) Data of Fig. 5 reanalyzed using the model given in section IV.A. The time is given in the

units of W-1, i.e.,  τ = Wt . The optimum parameter set from Fig. 6(a)):  pd=0.173, α=0.381, and

W-1=12.75 ps was used; the only adjustable parameter was  υ= a b/

,  the  ratio  of  the  Onsager

radius  a and  the  distribution  width  b  (eq.  22).  For  (i)  υ>>1;  for  (ii),  υ=3.  The  time-domain

kinetics were obtained by numerical Laplace transform of Ω(s) obtained using eqs. (6), (9), (10),

and (23). (b) The survival probability Ω(τ)  as  a  function  of  υ   was calculated using the same

model  parameters  as  in  (a).  The  dimensionless  time  τ  is  given  on  the  logarithmic  scale.

Parameters υ are indicated in the plot next to the traces. For υ<1, these kinetics look much like

those given by eq. (8).

Appendix.  Biphotonic excitation: the photophysics.

3

In this Appendix, we consider the photophysics of 400 nm excitation of aqueous
hydroxide (Figs. 2S, 3S, and 4S). It is known that water itself can be photoionized by
simultaneous  absorption  of  three  400  nm  photons.  A  3-photon  absorption
coefficient β
  of 900 cm3/TW2 has been reported for neat H2O [50]. This estimate was
obtained from transmission data on picosecond pulses passing through a 1 cm cell. Our
recent  study  on  electron  yield  and  pump  transmission  for  femtosecond  400  nm  pulses
passing through a 70 µm jet gives a somewhat lower estimate of 270 cm3/TW2 (Crowell
et  al.,  in  preparation). That study suggested that just below the onset of the dielectric
breakdown of water at (5-10) TW/cm2, the 3-photon regime is succeeded by a different
regime (which was called "3+1" regime). The salient feature of the latter regime is that
once the pump power exceeds a certain threshold level (0.3-1 TW/cm2), the electron yield
increases linearly with the incident laser power (e.g., Fig. 4S(a)), and the line does not
extrapolate  to  zero  yield  for  low  irradiance.  Simultaneously,  the  electron  spectrum
observed for t>5 ps shifts to the red and thermalization dynamics observed to the red of
800  nm  become  progressively  slower;  both  of  these  changes  correlate  with  the  laser
power. As shown elsewhere, all of these spectral and kinetic changes indicate rapid heat
elimination  by  photoexcited  water  molecules  that  do  not  undergo  ionization.  Such  a
situation is possible due to extremely nonuniform deposition of photoexcitation energy
across the sample, rapid heat transfer in water, and relatively low 3-photon quantum yield
(ca. 0.42) for 400 nm photoionization of water.

Provided that the 2-photon absorbance by OH- is small (as shown below), unless
the concentration of hydroxide is very high, the 3-photon excitation of the solvent always
competes with the 2-photon excitation of the solute.

Transient absorbance experiments at high 400 nm irradiance were carried out at
Argonne.  Pump  irradiances  to  2  TW/cm2  were  obtained  by  doubling  in  frequency  the
-
Ti:sapphire  fundamental. Fig.  2S  shows  typical  power  dependencies  obtained  for  eaq
yield in KOH solution, for pump radiance below the "3+1" threshold; Fig. 4S shows the
same dependence over a larger range of pump irradiances, for [OH-]=1 M. Whereas in
neat water, the 800 nm absorbance increases as power n=2.96 of the pump irradiance
(Fig. 2S(a)), this exponent decreases to n=2.37 or 2.56 in the 0.99 M (Figs. 2S(b) and
4S(a)) solution and 2.14 in the 4.6 M solution (Fig. 2S(a)). At any given pump power, the
800 nm absorbance increases linearly with [OH-] (inset in Fig. 2S(b)), although the slope
decreases markedly with the pump power.

These trends can be understood assuming that there is a competition between 2-
photon  absorption  of  the  400  nm  photons  by  OH-  and  3-photon  absorption  of  these
photons by water. To estimate the 2-photon absorption coefficient β2[OH-] for OH- in 2 x
400  nm  photoexcitation  of  hydroxide,  we  assumed  that  the  probe  beam  is  infinitely
narrow (since the ratio of the probe and pump beam radii was < 0.2) The absorption of
the time-dependent irradiance J(x,t) of the pump pulse is given by

final  result  depends  only  on  the  pulse  shape;  it  does  not  depend  on  the  actual  pulse
width). Under our assumptions, the optical density ∆OD due to the electron absorbance at

concentration of hydroxide, when the first term in the integral eq. (A2) is large) and 3 (for
dilute solutions). For sufficiently high pump irradiance (> 1 TW/cm2), the second term in
eq.  (A2)  always  dominates.  To  estimate  β2,  we  let  β3=270  cm2/TW3  and  φ3  =0.42,
assumed that φ2 =1, and matched β2 to obtain (i) the best fit of ∆OD for a fixed pump
radiance as a function of [OH-] and (ii) the best fit of factor n as a function of [OH-]. This
procedure gave a self-consistent estimate of 3.8 cm TW-1 M-1 (see Fig. 3S).

Normalized  difference  traces  ∆OD(t)-∆OD(t=550  ps) from Fig.  3(b)  as  a  function  of
temperature  (indicated  in  the  color  table).  The  traces  were  normalized  by  the  t>50  ps
integral. Dashed horizontal line corresponds to zero.

Double logarithmic plot of a transient 800 nm absorbance at t=20 ps vs. 400 nm pump
power  (given  in  arbitrary  units;  one  unit  corresponds  to  ca.  0.2  TW/cm2)  for  (a)  neat
water  (circles)  and  4.6  M  KOH  (squares)  and  (b)  0.989  M  (squares)  and  5  M  KOH
(circles). The exponential factors n are given in the plot. These factors depended on the
experimental conditions (e.g., jet thickness, irradiance range, and beam spot matching)
and were not perfectly reproducible from one series to another. The general trend is that
the photon order n systematically decreases from 3 to 2 with the increase in [KOH]. The
inset in (b) shows  ∆OD t
= 20
 for 0.13 TW/cm2 pump as a function of [KOH]. The
(
concentration plots are linear for other pump powers too.

A simulation of the power dependencies shown in Fig. 2S using numerical solutions to
eqs.  (A1) and (A2) in the Appendix. The following parameters were assumed: optical
path of 150 µm, molar extinction coefficient for the electron of 17,670 M-1  cm-1, β3=270
cm2/TW3 for neat water, φ3 =0.42 (see Appendix) and φ2 =1. The absorption coefficient
β2[OH-]  was  varied  between  0  (trace  (i))  and  50  cm/TW  and  the  power  plots  were
analyzed in the same way as the data in Fig. 2S. The value β2=3.8 cm/TW gave the best
match to the concentration dependence shown in Fig. 2S(b) and the observed dependence
of n vs. [KOH] (given in the color table to the right of the plot). For reference, the power
dependence for a hypothetical photosystem in which all of the 400 nm light is absorbed
by 1 M OH- is given in trace (ii).

(a) Power dependence for 800 nm absorbance in 400 nm excitation of 0.989 M KOH.
The signal is obtained at t=7 ps at the end of the thermalization dynamics of the electron.
Note  the  double  logarithmic  scale.  The  origin  of  the  y-axis  corresponds  to  zero
photoinduced  absorbance.  At  the  higher  end  of  the  available  irradiance  range  (>  1
TW/cm2), the photon order changes from 2.37 to 1.04. Over the same irradiance range,
the  photon  order  for  neat  water  also  changes  from  3  to  1,  indicating  the  onset  of  the
“3+1”  regime  (see  Appendix).  (b)  Normalized  800  nm  kinetics  obtained  for  400  nm
excitation of the same solution with (i) 3, (ii) 15.6, and (iii) 85 µJ pump pulses. At the
highest  power,  the  geminate  kinetics  are  very  flat;  the  gentle  bend  is  due  to  cross
recombination. At low and intermediate pump power, the kinetics are a weighted sum of
the 2-photon kinetics shown in Fig. 5(a), trace (ii) and 3-photon kinetics due to the water

ionization. In a thin jet, the 2-photon kinetics can be observed only when the absorption
signal  is  low,  <  10 µOD; otherwise, 3-photon ionization always intrudes.  Fig. 5 show
signals in this regime collected at higher repetition rate in a longer path length cell.

Μ(α,τ)    given  by  eq. (17) vs. dimensionless time τ=Wt as a function of parameter α.
From top to bottom: α=0 to 1 in the increments of 0.1.

“Temperature dependencies” for parameters D/W, α, and pd calculated using the potential
at To=298 K which is shown in Fig. 6(b) (see section IV.A for the parameterization). The
parameters shown in the temperature plot were obtained by scaling the potential U(r) by a
factor of To/T, as described in the text.

Diffusion  constant  De  of  hydrated  electron  in  neat  water  plotted  as  a  function  of
temperature. The empirical formula used to calculate these data (for De in cm2/s and the
temperature T in oC) is given below (taken from ref. [60]).

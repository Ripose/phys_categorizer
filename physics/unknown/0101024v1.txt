   The kinetics of solubilization of multilamellar egg-yolk lecithin liposomes (MLV-EYL) with
Triton  X-100  was  studied  by  rectangular  optical  diffusimetric  measurements  as  a  function  of
cholesterol  (Chol)  concentration.  It  was  determinated  the  variation  of  optic  percentage
diffusion  (per  µmol  surfactant),  ∆Dif%/µmol  TX-100,    in  the  course  of  solubilization  of
MLV-EYL-Chol  system with TX-100 10mM. The statistical analysis of the titration curves
can reveal the contribution of cholesterol to the stability of phospholipid bilayer membranes.
The  solubilization  of  the  lecithin-cholesterol  mixtures,  with  a  high  cholesterol  content  ,  in
order to form stable mixed micelles cholesterol-EYL-DOCNa, it requires much more bile salt.

Abstract

Introduction

The  interaction  of  surfactants  with  phospholipid  liposomes  produces  the  disintegration  of
bilayers and formation different non-lamellar structures as micelles. Information on kinetics
of  liposome  solubilization  with  surfactants  is  scarce.  However  some  papers  concerning  the
kinetics  of  interaction  of  phosphatidylcholine  liposomes  with  Triton  X-100  [Alonso,1987]
with  sodium  deoxycholate  [Lichtenberg,1979]  or  kinetics  of  micellar  →  lamellar  phase  in
phosphatidylcholine-cholate  mixtures  [Lichtenberg,1989]. There  are  some  researches  on  the
release of carboxyfluorescein or calcin studies by solubilization with surfactants as Triton X-
100 and sodium dodecylsulphate [Maza,1996; Gregoriadis,1984].The effect of cholesterol on
kinetics  of  multilamellar  vesicle  solubilization  with  Triton  X-100  may  be  used  to  explain
some  biological  fenomena  as  the  major  role  played  by  it  in  bile  and  gallstone  [Müller,
1990;Bondar,1998].

The  statistical  analysis  of  the  titration  curves,  obtained  by  rectangular  diffusimetric
measurements,  can  reveal  the  contribution  of  cholesterol  to  the  stability  of  phospholipid
bilayer membranes.

Apparatus, materials and methods

Egg  yolk  lecithine  (EYL)  was  purchased  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.  type  X-E
(cat.no.P5394/1996)  purified by  us  by  neutral alumina  column  chromatography,  verified  by
thin layer chromatography (silicagel). The  mobile  phase  was  a  mixture  CHCl3:CH3OH:H2O
(65:30:4,vol).  The  identification  of  the  phospholipid    was  made  with  iodine  and  shows  a
single  spot.  1  ml  EYL  stock  solution  of  18.6mM  concentration  in  a  solvent  mixture
CHCl3:CH3OH (9:1,vol) was evaporated under methane stream for 15 minutes, at 52 °C. The
lipid film formed on the wall of a 100 ml flask attached to the rotary evaporator, was dried at
a low pressure (p<0.01 Torr) for 4 hours at room temperature. Taking into account the mass
of  the  lipid  film  and  phosphate  content  of  it  (mineralized  with  nitroperchloric  mixture,and
assayed  by  Briggs  method),  we  determined  the  mean  molecular  weight  of  the  lecithin,  as
being  766  Da.  This  molecular  weight  is  almost  identical  with  the  value  of  the  lecithine
supplied by Avanti Polar Lipids Inc.

The Triton X-100  (TX-100)  was  purchased from  Merck,  from  Sigma  Chemical  Co.
and  Cholesterol  (Chol)  from  Fluka  AG.  Tris(hydroxymethyl)-aminomethane-  HCl  (Tris-Cl)
was purchased from Austranal. These chemicals and the organic solvents were of analytical
grade.Double distilled water was used.

By using a spectrophotometer Specol with FR optical diffusion system and photocells
and  voltage  source  type  HQE  40  and  UV  lamp  type  OSRAM  there  were  titrated  at  a
0,04µmol/s  rate  at  20°C,  samples  of  1.4ml  suspension  (0.7µmols  of  EYL)  which
vesicles contained cholesterol at different molar ratios with phospholipid.

Liposome dispersion preparation

Appropriate  amounts  of  EYL  in  chloroform:methanol  (9:1,vol)  and  cholesterol  in
chloroform  solutions  were  evaporated,  in  a  glass  test  tube,  under  a  nitrogen  stream  until  it
reached the consistence  of  a  lipid  film  on  the  wall  tube  settled  down. The  film  was  purged
with the gas for 30 minutes in order to eliminate the alcohol traces. The film hydration and
bilayer suspension were made with buffer Tris-Cl 0.05M, pH=7.2 at 0.6mg/ml (lipid/solution)
by vortexing 10 s.

This comparison reveals the fact that the increase of molar concentration of cholesterol in the
phospholipid  bilayers  slows  down  their  solubilization  with  surfactants.  The  best  statistical
significance  can  be  observed  by  comparing  the  MLV-EYL  solubilization  with  the  MLV-
EYL-cholesterol, at the molar ratio EYL:Chol=1:1. This phenomenon is due to the inclusion
of cholesterol in the lipid bilayers, and it modifies the bile salt partition between the bilayers
and water environment in favour of the latter as a consequence, in order to obtain a certain
effective  molar  ratio  surfactant/phospholipid,  Re,  it  is  necessary  to  have  a  biliare  salt
concentration  higher  when  the  bilayers  contain  cholesterol,  than  in  the  case  when  the
cholesterol  is  missing.  On  the  other  hand,  the  solubilization  of  the  lecithin-cholesterol
mixtures, with a high cholesterol content , in order to form stable mixed micelles cholesterol-
EYL-DOCNa, it requires much more bile salt.

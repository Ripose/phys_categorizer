Abstract

We  present  a  new  form  of  explicitly  correlated  wave  function  whose  parameters  are  mainly

linear, to circumvent the problem of the optimization of a large number of non-linear parameters

usually encountered with basis sets of explicitly correlated wave functions. With this trial wave

function we succeeded in minimizing the energy instead of the variance of the local energy, as is

more  common  in  quantum  Monte  Carlo  methods.  We  applied  this  wave  function  to  the

calculation  of  the  energies  of  Be  3P  (1s22p2)  and  Be-  4So  (1s22p3)  by  variational  and  diffusion

Monte Carlo methods. The results compare  favorably  with  those  obtained  by  different  types  of

explicitly correlated trial wave functions already described in the literature. The energies obtained

are improved with respect to the best variational ones found in literature, and within one standard

deviation from the estimated non-relativistic limits.

Introduction

The description of the electron correlation plays a central role in highly accurate quantum

chemistry  calculations.  Mean-field  methods  give  a  qualitative  description  for  many  atomic  and

molecular systems, but in order to get quantitative results the instantaneous correlation between

electrons must  be  taken  into  account.  The  most  common  way  to  include  correlation  is,  starting

from  the  Hartree-Fock  picture,  to  approximate  the  exact  wave  function  using  MC-SCF  or  CI

expansions. Unfortunately methods based on the orbital approximation  converge  very  slowly  to

the  non-relativistic  limit.  The  reason  is  that  these  wave  functions  include  the  interelectronic

distances only in an implicit form. Furthermore  this  implicit  dependence  is  quadratic  instead  of

linear,  so  the  cusp  conditions  [1]  of  the  exact  wave  functions  are  reproduced  only  for  infinite

expansions.

A  very  efficient  and  effective  approach  to  accurately  describe  the  local  behavior  of  the

wave function when two electrons collide is the explicit inclusion of the interelectronic distances

into an approximate wave function. Hylleraas [2], Pekeris [3], James and Coolidge [4], and Kolos

and  Wolniewicz  [5-7]  showed  how  to  obtain  very  accurate  results  for  two  electron  systems  by

including  the  interelectronic  distance  into  the  wave  function.  An  alternative  possibility  is  the

construction  of  many-particle  permutational  symmetry  adapted  functions  in  hyperspherical

coordinates  [8,  9].  Unfortunately  it  is  not  easy  to  generalize  these  methods  to  many-electron

systems since the resulting integrals are extremely difficult to evaluate analytically. Beyond four

electron systems, with at most two nuclei, the analytical approach becomes almost unfeasible [10,

11].

Instead  of  computing  the  integrals  analytically,  one  could  resort  to  a  numerical  method.

The variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method [12, 13] is a very powerful numerical technique that

estimates  the  energy,  and  all  the  desired  properties,  of  a  given  trial  wave  function  without  any

need to analytically  compute  the  matrix  elements.  For  this  reason  it  poses  no  restriction  on  the

functional  form  of  the  trial  wave  function,  requiring  only  the  evaluation  of  the  wave  function

value, its gradient and its Laplacian, and these are easily computed. Using the VMC algorithm,

essentially a stochastic numerical integration scheme, the expectation value of the energy for any

form  of 

the 

trial  wave  function  can  be  estimated  by  averaging 

the 

local  energy

fluctuations of the local energy depend on the quality of the function Y

exact wave function is used (zero variance principle). VMC can also be used to optimize the trial
wave function Y

T, and we refer the reader to the literature for the technical details.

A popular and effective approach to building compact explicitly correlated wave functions

is  to  multiply  a  determinantal  wave  function  by  a  correlation  factor,  the  most  commonly  used

being  a  Jastrow  factor  [16].  The  inclusion  of  the  Jastrow  factor  does  not  allow  the  analytical

evaluation of the integrals, so the use of VMC is mandatory. However, departing from the usual

determinantal wave function form can be very fruitful [11], allowing an accurate and, at the same

time, compact description of atomic and molecular systems. Very few terms are needed to reach a

good accuracy, in comparison to more common wave function forms.

The  recovery  of  the  remaining  correlation  energy  can  be  done  using  the  diffusion  Monte

Carlo (DMC) method. Since this method is already well described in the literature, we refer the

reader to the available  reviews  [12,  13].  We  only  recall  here  that  in  this  method  the  exact,  but

unknown,  wave  function  is  interpreted  as  a  probability  density.  In  the  fixed-node  (FN)
approximation  [17]  the  nodal  surfaces  of  the  trial  wave  function  Y

T  are  used  to  partition  the

space and within each region the wave function can be safely interpreted as a probability density.

It can be shown that the FN-DMC energies are an upper bound to the exact ground state energy.

This paper is part of an ongoing project in our laboratory to develop accurate and compact

wave functions for few-electron systems.

In  our  previous  works  [11,  18,  19]  we  used  linear  expansions  of  explicitly  correlated  wave

functions  for  calculations  on  the  ground  state  of  few-electron  systems.  In  all  cases  good  VMC

energies  were  obtained,  both  in  infinite  nuclear  mass  approximation  calculations  and  non-

adiabatic  calculations.  In  particular  we  used  a  linear  expansion  of  explicitly  correlated

exponential  functions  to  develop  accurate  wave  functions  for  two  test  systems:  the  beryllium

atom and the lithium hydride molecule in their ground state.

Here  we  present  a  new  form  of  explicitly  correlated  wave  function  and  we  use  VMC  to

extend the application of correlated trial wave function to excited states and five electron systems.

Furthermore  we  use  DMC  to  approximate  the  exact  energies  and  compare  them  with  the

estimated non-relativistic limits.

We choose the Be  3P (1s22p2) and Be-  4So (1s22p3) states which are involved in Beryllium

electron  affinity  determination.  We  compare  VMC  and  DMC  energies  and  variances  of  the

energy and examine the nodal properties of the trial wave functions comparing FN-DMC results

with  the  best  variational  calculations  and  the  non-relativistic  limits  estimated  by  Chung  and

coworkers [20, 21].

In  this  equation  Aˆ   is  the  antisymmetrizer  operator,  f  is  a  function  of  all  the  electron-

nucleus  distances  and  g  is  a  function  of  all  the  electron-electron  distances  called  correlation
factor.  Both  functions  include  variational  parameters.  Q

  is  an  eigenfunction  of  the  spin

operators 

2Sˆ  and 

zSˆ  of the correct spin multiplicity. The functions f

 and g, being dependent only

on interparticle distances, are rotationally invariant.  This  means  that  their  product  can  describe

only S states, with zero angular momentum. To describe higher angular  momentum  states,  it  is

necessary to include a function f(r) with the correct rotational symmetry. f(r) is a function of the

Cartesian  electronic  coordinates  (x,y,z),  but  might  include  also  the  electron-nucleus  distances
[11]. This Y

 function might be generalized including products of the interparticle distances, that

is Y

 is the two-body term of a many-body expansion of the wave function. It is possible to further

generalize the wave function by taking linear combinations of such terms.

To  assure  a  high  quality  wave  function  it  is  particularly  important  that  the  function  Y

satisfy  the  cusp  conditions  [1],  representing  the  behavior  of  the  exact  wave  function  at  the

coalescence of two particles. It is also important to take into account the  asymptotic  conditions

[22], which represent the behavior when one of the particles go to infinity.

The  first  type  of  functional  form  we  examined  is  generated  assuming  a  Pade’  factor

In the following this wave function will be called Pade'-Jastrow. The Pade’ factor is a good

choice  for  the  electron-nucleus  part,  because  it  is  the  best  compromise  between  flexibility  and

small number of parameters. In fact this function goes as

So with different exponents it can accommodate both the coalescence at the nucleus and the decay

for large r. It is also important to point out that this factor can accurately describe both 1s and 2s

orbitals as we have shown in our previous work [11].

The main problem with linear expansions of explicitly correlated trial wave functions is the

huge  number  of  non-linear  parameters  to  optimize.    In  our  previous  work  [11]  for  more

In the following we will call Eq. 3 pre-exponential wave function (prex).

Even if this kind of wave function allows us to reduce the effort for the optimization of the

parameters,  we  recall  that  the  CPU  time  needed  to  evaluate  explicitly  correlated  trial  wave

functions  is  very  large  and  proportional  to  the  number  of  permutations  generated  by  the

antisymmetrizer. No matter the form we choose for explicitly correlated wave functions, they are

limited to few electron systems.

In  this  paper  we  also  compare  Pade'-Jastrow  and  pre-exponential  wave  functions  with  a

more  standard  form,  widely  used  in  QMC  calculations  [23,  24],  that  is  the  product  of  a

determinantal function times the Schmidt-Moskowitz [25] correlation factor (SM):

Optimization of the trial wave functions

Our previous work [11] showed that departing from the usual determinantal wave function

form  can  be  very  fruitful,  allowing  to  write  very  compact  and  at  the  same  time  very  accurate

wave functions. However it is computationally much more demanding and for this reason special

care must be given to the design of an efficient way of generating and optimizing the trial wave

function.  These  steps  must  be  implemented  in  the  most  effective,  fast  and  efficient  way.  The

standard  way  to  optimize  a  trial  wave  function  using  VMC  is  to  minimize  the  variance  of  the

local energy using a fixed sample of walkers; a method proposed by Frost [26] and Conroy [27]

and described in detail by Umrigar, Wilson, and Wilkins [28] and by Mushinsky and Nightingale

[29]. This has been proved to be numerically much more stable than the energy minimization. For

our  trial  wave  functions  we  have  found  very  effective  the  minimization  of  the  variance  of  the

energy

wave functions.

As  to  Eq.  2,  the  optimization  of  the  first  term  of  the  expansion  is  usually  performed

starting from a trial wave function with a reasonable  electron-electron  Jastrow  factor,  and  with

the electron-nucleus functions coming from some standard Slater orbital basis set, or from small

basis sets optimized at the SCF level. As we showed in our previous work [11], it is possible to

build  a  trial  wave  function  as  a  linear  expansion  of  n  terms  by  adding  an  extra  term  to  an

optimized n-1 term wave function. This procedure worked well for two and three electron systems

with simple exponential basis sets, but not for more sophisticated Pade’ and Jastrow basis sets.

For these reasons in this work we optimized only one term Pade’-Jastrow functions.

Let  us  now  consider  the  case  of  the  pre-exponential  trial  wave  function.  The  function  in

Eq. 3 can be written as a linear combination:

As to the linear parameters, we succeeded in minimizing the energy instead of the variance
of the local energy or the second moment m (ER), so we could choose the best  linear  parameters

according to the observable we are interested in. The standard linear variational methods requires

the solution of the secular problem, and so the calculation of the matrix elements

These integrals are evaluated during a VMC simulation.

We show the main features of this pre-exponential trial wave function using as benchmarks

the Be and Li ground states.

In table 1 we compare the energy for Be 1S0 ground state obtained by the one term Pade’-

Jastrow  function  with  the  value  calculated  by  the  function  obtained  adding  a  pre-exponential

including all the electron-nucleus and electron-electron distances and their products, a total of 66

terms.  The  two  values  evidence  a  large  gain  of  correlation  energy  for  the  addition  of  the  pre-

exponential  factor  and  further  improvement  is  obtained  adding  20  more  terms,  that  is  the  third

and fourth powers of the electron-nucleus and electron-electron distances, to the linear expansion.

So the pre-exponential factor adds flexibility to the wave function in a very efficient way.

To examine the relative efficiency of linear and non linear parameters in adding flexibility

to the wave function, for the Li ground state (see table 2) we compare the  energy  of  a  28-term

pre-exponential function with the result of a 8-term expansion of explicitly correlated exponential

functions, a simplified form of the Pade'-Jastrow wave function in which both the factor f

 and the

correlation factor g are in the form exp(cr). These two trial wave functions give a similar gain of

correlation  energy,  but  in  the  pre-exponential  case  there  are  12  non-linear  and  28  linear

parameters, while the 8 term expansion of correlated exponential functions includes 48 non-linear

and  8  linear  parameters.  In  spite  of  the  smaller  number  of  parameters  the  pre-exponential

function gives a better result, and its optimization process was much easier and faster.

We optimized the linear parameters also by minimization of m (ER). The calculated energy

at  VMC  level  is  worse  than  the  one  obtained  by  minimization  of  the  energy:  this  is  obviously
related to the different minima of the energy and m (ER).

Results and discussion

For  Be  3P  (1s22p2)  and  Be-   4So  (1s22p3)  we  computed  SCF  and  CASSCF  trial  wave

functions using GAMESS with the Slater orbital basis sets reported in table 3. Each orbital was

fitted with 6 Gaussian functions. We optimized the Schmidt-Moskowitz correlation factor of the

SCF-SM  functions  and  the  non-linear  parameters  of  the  Pade’-Jastrow  and  pre-exponential

functions minimizing the variance of the local energy.

Beside  the  VMC  energies,  we  report  the  variance  of  the  local  energy,  given  by  Eq.  7,

estimated  using  VMC.  DMC  energies  were  obtained  by  a  linear  fit  of  the  energy  at  three  time

steps (t =5, 3, and 1 mhartree-1) and extrapolation to t =0 mhartree-1.

We  compare  our  results  with  the  best  variational  energies  obtained  by  Chung  and

coworkers [20, 21], who used linear expansions of Slater orbitals in the L-S-coupling scheme.

The  calculations  for  the  excited  state  Be  3P  (1s22p2)  were  carried  out  with  the  following

1) a single determinantal function times a nine term Schmidt-Moskowitz correlation factor;

2) a one term Pade’-Jastrow function;

3) a pre-exponential function with 33 terms.

The results are reported in table 4.

As  to  the  determinantal  wave  function,  we  used  only  a  single  determinant,  as  the  energy

lowers by only 0.003 hartree on going from the SCF to a CASSCF function for two electrons in

an active space of two p shells (15 configurations, the highest weight of the first double excitation

being equal to 0.04).

The  explicit  inclusion  of  the  interelectronic  distances  in  the  wave  function  by  the  SM  factor

results in a large improvement of the quality of the wave function, as shown from the lowering of

the  energy  (0.043  hartree)  and  the  variance  of  the  energy  (almost  four  times  smaller)  on  going

from SCF to SCF-SM/VMC.

A  further  improvement  of  the  trial  wave  function  at  VMC  level  is  found  using  more

sophisticated functional forms [11], like the Pade’-Jastrow and the pre-exponential ones. For the

pre-exponential function we used a 33 term expansion, including all ri, ri

2, and the products ririj.

In particular in the case of the pre-exponential function we were able to optimize the linear

parameters  of  G(r)  minimizing  the  energy,  not  the  variance  of  the  local  energy,  obtaining  an

energy 0.9 mhartree higher than the best variational one. We also notice that this wave function is

very compact with 45 (12 non-linear and 33 linear) variational parameters on the whole.

At  DMC  level  already  the  SCF-SM  wave  function  gives  a  lower  energy  than  the  best

variational  value,  and  0.2  mhartree  higher  than  the  estimated  non-relativistic  limit  (NRL).  It

means that the nodal surfaces of this function are fairly good, at variance with the SCF-SM trial

wave function for the Be ground state, whose energy is 11 mhartree higher than the NRL [30].

This large nodal error is due to the strong contribution of the first double excitation in improving

the quality of the nodal surfaces, because of the quasi-degeneracy of the 2s and 2p orbital.

DMC  energies  for  Pade'-Jastrow  and  pre-exponential  functions  have  the  estimated  NRL

within one standard deviation, that is the nodal surfaces of these wave functions are correct and

better than the SCF ones.

Be- 4So (1s2 2p3)

functions:

The calculations for  the  excited  state  Be-  4So  were  carried  out  with  these  four  trial  wave

1) a single determinantal function times a nine term Moskowitz-Schmidt correlation factor;

2) a multideterminantal function times a nine term Moskowitz-Schmidt correlation factor;

3) a one term Pade’-Jastrow  function;

4) a pre-exponential function G(r) with 61 terms.

The CASSCF wave function for three electrons in an active space of two p shells includes

20  configurations.  The  first  two  highest  weights,  relative  to  the  first  double  and  single  excited

configurations,  are  equal  to  0.125  and  0.03  and  indicate  a  more  marked  multiconfigurational

character of the wave function.

As we have seen for Be 3P state, the gain in energy and the lowering of the variance of the

energy  between  SCF  and  SCF-SM  are  very  large,  while  between  SCF-SM  and  CASSCF-SM

they are an order of magnitude less.

The results are reported is table 5.

For  Be-  using  the  Pade’  and  pre-exponential  functions  we  obtained  better  energies  and

variances of the energy than the SCF-SM and CASSCF-SM ones, as already seen in the Be  3P

2
case. In particular, with the pre-exponential function  with  61  linear  parameters  G(r)    (all  ri,  ri

and the products ririj), the VMC energy is 0.9 mhartree higher than the best variational energy.

From DMC simulations we see clearly that the nodal surfaces don’t change on going from

the SCF to the CASSCF trial wave function and in both cases we have around 0.4 mhartree of

Pade'-Jastrow  and  pre-exponential  functions  have  better  nodal  surfaces  and  their  DMC

energies have the estimated NRL within one standard deviation.

nodal error.

Conclusions

We have used explicitly correlated functional forms to improve the quality of the trial wave

functions usually adopted to calculate the  energy  of  a  system.  For  the  two  excited  states  of  Be

and  Be-  we  obtained  better  non-relativistic  energies  with  very  compact  trial  wave  functions

compared to the best variational results.

Using a suitable pre-exponential factor we were able to improve the flexibility of the trial

wave function without including too many non-linear parameters: this kind of trial wave function

allowed us to minimize directly the energy instead of the variance of the local energy. As to the

computational  time,  the  optimization  of  the  Be-  five  electron  trial  wave  function  and  the  VMC

calculation required around a week on a modern PC .It is not possible to compare this CPU time

with calculations by correlated Gaussians as at present they are limited to four electron systems.

Our DMC energies are in good agreement with the estimated NRL obtained by Chung and

coworkers [20, 21].

From our best values for Be 3P (-14.39547(5) hartree) and Be-   4So (-14.40620(6) hartree)

we  compute  an  electron  affinity  of  0.01073(8)  hartree  =  292(2)  meV,  within  two  standard

deviations from the experimental value 295.49(25) meV [31] and the theoretical value 295.0(7)

calculated by Hsu and Chung [20]. A significant comparison would require the reduction of the

calculated standard deviation by one order of magnitude.

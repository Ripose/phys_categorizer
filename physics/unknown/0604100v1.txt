In this communication we propose and also verify through ab 
initio  calculations  a  new  electronic  structure  principle,  viz.  the 
minimum  magnetizability  principle  (MMP),  to  extend  the 
domain  of  applicability  of  the  conceptual  density  functional 
theory  (DFT)  1  in  explaining  the  magnetic  interactions  and 
magnetochemistry.  This  principle  may  be  stated  as,  “A  stable 
configuration/conformation  of  a  molecule  or  a  favorable 
chemical  process  is  associated  with  a  minimum  value  of  the 
magnetizability”.  We  also  show  that  a  soft  molecule  is  easily 
polarizable and magnetizable than a hard one. 

Chemical reactivity parameters such as electronegativity2 (χ) 

and hardness3,4 (η) have been defined within DFT1 as follows:

where,  μ  is  the  chemical  potential  of  an  N-  electron  system 
with external potential v(r) and total energy E. A many-particle 
system is completely characterized by N and v(r). While χ and 
η  describe  the  response  of  the  system  when  N  changes  (∆N 
perturbation)  at  fixed  v(r),  the  linear  density  response  function 
does  that  job  for  the  variation  of  v(r)  (∆v  perturbation)  at 
constant  N.  The  linear  responses  of  the  electronic  cloud  of  a 
chemical  species  to  weak  external  electric  and  magnetic  fields 
are measured in terms of polarizability (α) and magnetizability 
(ξ) respectively, as follows:

Two  hardness  related  electronic  structure  principles 
are the hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) principle5 and the maximum 
hardness  principle (MHP)6 while the former states that,5 “Hard 
likes  hard  and  soft  likes  soft”,  the  statement  of  the  latter  is,6 
“There  seems  to  be  a  rule  of  nature  that  molecules  arrange 
themselves so as to be as hard as possible”. Parr et al defined7

For  a  stable  configuration  with  proper  extremal  behavior  of 
both  μ  and  η,  the  electrophilicity7  also  assumes  its  minimum 
value.8 The global softness is defined as1 
 
 

S
There  exists  a  linear  relationship  between  softness  and  α1/3 
for  both  ground9  and  excited10  electronic  states.  This  linear 
relationship  gave  rise  to  the  minimum  polarizability  principle 
(MPP)11 which states that, “The natural direction of evolution of 
any  system  is  towards  a  state  of  minimum  polarizability”.  In 
this  communication  we  propose  a  minimum  magnetizability 

(7) 

 

minimum in the total magnetizability is driven by the minimum 
observed  in  the  paramagnetic  component.  The  diamagnetic 
component,  however,  does  not  change  much  during  the 
asymmetric stretch.   

This  principle  (MMP)  will  help  understanding  the  magnetic 

interactions better.

principle  as,  “A  stable  configuration/conformation  of  a 
molecule  or  a  favorable  chemical  process  is  associated  with  a 
minimum value of the magnetizability”. 

 

In  order  to  verify  our  prognosis  we  study  the 
asymmetric and symmetric stretching of H2O. Calculations were 
performed  using  DALTON12  system  of  programs.  MP2  level 
properties  are  calculated  using  second-order-perturbation-
propagation-approximation (SOPPA) 13 method. 

Figure  1  depicts  the  linear  variations  in  α1/3,  |ξdm|1/3 
and  |ξpm|1/3  with  2S  during  the  stretching  of  H2O.  The  variants 
of  HSAB  principle  and  MHP  in  terms  of  polarizability  and 
magnetizability  would  be  helpful 
in  analyzing  chemical 
reactions  especially  when  they  are  associated  with  changes  in 
electrical and magnetic properties.  

 

Figure 2 presents the related variations in η, α and ω 
with  respect  to  (O-H)  bond  length  during  asymmetric  stretch. 
As  expected  from  the  MHP  and  MPP,  η  attains  its  maximum 
value and α attains its minimum value for the equilibrium bond 
length  where  ω  is  also  a  minimum.  The  chemical  potential 
remains constant14 in the sense of Pearson-Palke15 and Makov.16 
During  symmetric  stretch  no  maximum  in  η  is  observed  near 
equilibrium geometry as chemical potential itself is not constant 
hence the principle cannot be tested in this case. This is also in 
agreement with earlier works on PMH.14, 15 Variation in μ, η, α, 
ξ  and  ω  with  respect  to  (O-H)  bond  length  during  symmetric 
stretch is available as supporting information.

Abstract  
 
Involving effects of media, opinion leader and other agents on the opinion of individuals of 
market  society,  a  trader  based  model  is  developed  and  utilized  to  simulate  price  via  supply 
and  demand.  Pronounced  effects  are  considered  with  several  weights  and  some  personal 
differences  between  traders  are  taken  into  account.  Resulting  time  series  and  probabilty 
distribution function involving a power law for price come out similar to the real ones. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
 
Members  of  market  society  are  well  known  to  act  fundamentally  according  to  their  opinion 
[1] about to buy, to sell, and to wait, rather than real economic criteria. Opinions effect others 
and are effected by them and by other agents such as, media and opinion leaders, during their 
evolution through people, which are modeled as being cited on a square matrix. One of these 
approaches is known as the Sznajd model[2]. (Relevant issues may  be  found  in  [3]).  It  was 
amply used in attempts to predict votings. (See [4-11] for ‘voting model’, and see [11-15] for 
applications in some surface effects, such as catalytical reactions in material science. And, for 
economy and market related issues of opinion dynamics, see [15-17], and references therein.) 
   In  the  following  section  we  apply  opinion  dynamics  to  market,  and  in  the  next  one  we 
display our simulation results. Last section is devoted to conclusion. 
 
 
 
2. Opinion Dynamics for Market Society  
 
The present society is composed of ten thousand people, each willing to gain money. Yet, this 
characteristics does not unify but splits them into three categories as the  buyers (demanders, 
bulls),  the  sellers  (suppliers,  bears),  and  the  waiters  (wolfs).  Each  of  them  seeks  for  the 
opinion  of  the  others,  since  the  market  is  made  anonymously;  but  each  may  react  to  the 
gathered (surrounding) opinion in different manners.  For  example,  in  many  cases  buying  of 
others (demand) prompts selling (supply) of an individual, and vice versa. And from time to 
time herding mechanism works. Market customers are not like the referees of a beauty contest 
and  atoms  of  a  crystal.  In  the  present  approach,  a  random  individuality  is  assigned  to  each 
member, as a basic difference with respect to the previous applications of opinion dynamics to 
different  societies.  Secondly,  for  each  entry  of  the  matrix,  the  four  nearest  neighbors  are 
separated  from  the  next  nearest  neighbors  in  the  strength  of  bonds  inbetween.  Because,  the 

ability of one member to convince any other one may change from person to person. On the 
other hand, market people do not always believe to what they hear. Moreover, they may even 
do the opposite of what they are adviced to do. And indeed, there exist many people within 
exchange  who  prefer  to  buy  (strategically)  while  the  others  are  selling  (i.e.,  during 
recessions), and vice versa. 
   Individual opinions are initially let randomly to be either -1 (sell), or +1 (buy) or 0 (wait), 
i.e. each by 33.33% but which habitant has what opinion is selected randomly in the present 
approach. So, initial demand equals to the supply. As interaction tours take place, in a manner 
described  in  [2-4,  and  16],  the  range  of  opinion  effection  extends.  After  few  runs,  a 
considerable  number  of  the  100x100  matrix  inhabitants  become  effected  by  a  considerable 
number  of  co-matricians.  Accordingly,  excess  occurs  within  the  numbers  of  transactions 
demanded  and  supplied,  which  creates  an  impact  on  the  price.  For  example,  if  for  a  given 
price level, the number of demanded transactions becomes greater than the supplied (booked) 
amount,  price  increases.  Because,  the  present  booked  ones  will  be  bought  and  the  excess 
amout (equals to demand minus supply) have to be bought from the level which is one step 
higher  in  price,  and  vice  versa.  It  is  well  known  that,  price  of  shares  change  in  discreate 
amounts  (steps)  in  real  markets.  Some  portion  of  money  composing  the  volume  is  spent  to 
increase the number of transactions processed with a fixed price, and the other portion is spent 
to change the price. (See [18 and 19] and references therein.) 
   Negotiators  looking  for  a  compromise,  usually  follow  advices  of  their  broker  or  some  
commentator;  for  example,  an  experienced  and  skillful  friend  or  relative.  Such  an  opinion 
leader (market guru), is cited with fixed coordinates in the bulk, i.e., far from the borders of 
the society matrix. (See, references in [3].) The effect of the opinion leader is kept constant 
throughout  the  tours,  which  may  be  varied  in  other  tours.  Mass  media,  trying  to  influence 
opinions through advertising may also be handled in a similar manner, with its effect covering 
the whole inhabitants at any given time. It was found [20] that, “The larger the lattice is the 
smaller is the amount of advertising needed to conceive the whole market.” 
   Each market morning, people come to market with three possible opinions in their mind; to 
buy, to sell, or to wait (watch). And accordingly, they process or wait. In the present model, 
we  take  33.33%  of  the  society  as  buyers  (with  opinion  equals  to  +1),  and  33.33%  of  the 
society  as  sellers  (with  opinion  equals  to  –1),  and  the  rest  (33.33%)  as  waiters  initially.  As 
time  goes  on,  their  opinions  may  change  during  the  interaction  tours.  And  in  coming  tours, 
following  the  evolution  process  described  in  [2-4,  and  16],  some  may  become  new  buyers, 
some may become new sellers, and some may become new waiters. 
 
 
 
3. Market Simulations 
 
To sharpen the notation followed here: We call a collection of few runs (say, 4 in number) ‘a 
day’, and at the beginning of each new day we set the whole society to its initial values, i.e. 
the opinions to be either -1, or +1, or 0, as described in the previous section. The rest of the 
parameters are all kept as the same, except the leader or media effect, if any is being studied. 
   We figured out that, the leader or media effect become important in medium run, and any 
may not be regarded within our days comprising 4 tours. Figure 1 exemplifies an evolution of 
a leader (cited at the center) effect (with relative strength equals 0.8, white in colour in Fig.1. 
a)  through  the  society.  Within  the  first  5  tours  (Fig.1.  b),  the  leader  effect  spreads  over  her 
neighbors and simultaneously many other members become induced to have opinions ranging 
between  0.75  and  1,  due  to  natural  interactions.  And  at  the  end  (after  the  next  5  tours)  the 
pronounced  effect  becomes  completely  intracable  (Fig.1.  c),  as  can  be  compared  with  the 

natural distribution after 10 tours (Fig.1. d). According to the present result, one needs more 
than one agent to speculate on the market. And, short-cut is the mass media, where we obtain 
the  price  growing  exponentially  in  tours  (not  shown),  even  with  small  values  of  relative 
strength of influence. 
   In a scientific society there may not exist any antithetical member, yet in exchanges there 
exist many, especially within dealers and medium-big portfolio owners. Moreover, anybody 
may react oppositely from time to time. (Also, the whole amount of sellings are bought (or, 
vice versa) during herding.) We count all these to be one part in  five  (20%)  upmost, in our 
market  simulations.  Figure  2  displays  a  500  day  (and  4  runs  per  day)  result  of  a  free 
interaction  of  opinions,  i.e.,  without  any  guru  and  media  effects.  There,  we  utilized  the 
threshold values of +0.95 and –0.95 for bullish and bearish processes, respectively. (See, Eq. 
(4) and the relevant text in [21] for details.) Please notify that, the number of transactions per 
trader processed at any price level is irrelevant here. 
   The reader may regard that, the shape of our simulated price chart (Fig.2. a.) is very similar 
to  real  ones,  where  columns  below  represent  excess  in  transactions.  Probability  distribution 
function  for  fluctuations  in  price  is  diplayed  in  Fig.2.  b.,  where  we  have  a  power  law.  The 
extraordinary  tail  in  Fig.2.  b  is  due  to  setting  the  society  to  our  standard  initials,  each 
‘morning’, when very stiff rises and falls may take place. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
We run many more simulations with different parameters, and obtained very similar results. It 
is clear that, empirical values of coordination and strength of bonds, as well as the percentage 
of  antithetical  people  in  the  given  society  are  needed  for  better  utilization  of  the  presented 
results.

Abstract It is pointed out that at present we only prove that inertial static mass and gravitational static mass 

are  equivalent.  We  have  not  proved  that  inertial  moving  mass  and  gravitational  moving  mass  are  also 

equivalent.  It  is  proved  by  the  dynamic  effect  of  special  relativity  that  inertial  moving  mass  and 

gravitational  moving  mass  are  not  equivalent.  Besides,  it  can  be  proved  that  the  principle  of  general 

relativity  is  untenable.  It  is  only  an  apparent  felling  of  mankind  actually.  Therefore,  there  exists  serious 

defect  in  the  foundation  of  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation.  We  need  to  renovate  our  basic  idea  of 

space-time and gravity.

1. Equivalent principle is not consistent with special relativity 

We point out at first that the equivalent principle is not consistent with special relativity. Einstein used 

the  reference  frame  of  rotational  desk  to  show  the  principle  of  equivalence  and  concluded  that  the 

space-time of gravitational field was curved. As shown I Fig. 2.1, suppose that the desk 
r   and perimeter 
  is at rest in beginning. Then let the desk turn around its center in a uniform angle 
speed  ω. According to the contraction of space-time contract in special relativity, observers on the resting 
 
reference  frame  of  ground 

  would  find  that  the  perimeter  of  desk  becomes 

  with radium

owing to desk’s rotation, but the radium of desk would not contract for there is no motion in the direction of 
radium.  Therefore,  the  radio  of  perimeter  and  radium  would  be  less  than  π  and  the  observers  on  the 
ground would affirm that the space of rotating desk is non-Euclidean space.   

Fig. 2.1                                            Fig. 2.2                                                Fig. 2.3

The problem  now is  what  the observer  resting  on  the rotating desk thinks  about. Einstein  and almost 

textbook  of  general  relativity  took  a  mistake  here.  It  were  though  that  because  the  speed  of  tangent 

direction caused length contraction, when these observers used their rulers to measure the perimeter of desk, 

the perimeter becomes

π

r

, longer than that of resting desk. But when they use their 

rulers to measure the radium of desk, the length is unchanged. So the ratio of perimeter and radium is big 
than  π. However, this result is wrong, for it is based on the premises that desk is at rest and observer and 
his  ruler  move.  But  in  this  case  desk  rotates  actually  so  that  the  perimeter  of  desk  and  the  rulers  of 

observers  contract  synchronously.  So  the  observers  who  are  at  rest  on  desk  can  not  find  the  change  of 
desk’s perimeter actually by using their rulers.   

Secondly,  let’s  show  that  the  principle  of  equivalence  contradicts  with  the  concept  of  space-time 

relativity. There are two problems here. The first is that according to the common understanding of special 
relativity, space-time’s contraction is caused by relative speed, which has nothing to do with acceleration ( )1 . 
Or speaking strictly, the effect of acceleration is too small comparing with the effect of speed so that it can 

be neglected. So according to space-time relativity, for observers resting on rotating desk, 

  is at rest but 

ground  reference  frame 

  moves  around 

  shown in  Fig. 2.2.  In this  way,  the  observers  resting  on 

0K

1K

desk would think that the rulers on their hands are unchanged so that they can not conclude that space-time 

of  desk  is  curved.  Instead,  they  would  think  that  space-time  of  ground  reference  frame 

  should  be 

curved for 

  is moving around 

. Of course, this result can not be accepted. Therefore, if the concept 

0K

1K

of  space-time  relativity  holds,  we  can  not  conclude  that  the  space-time  of  gravitational  field  is  curved. 

Conversely,  if  the  space-time  of  gravitational  field  is  curved  and  the  principle  of  equivalence  holds,  the 

1K

0K

principle of space-time relativity would be violated.   

The second problem is that in light of general recognition of special relativity, space-time contract is a 

purely  relative  effect,  having  nothing  to  do  with  acceleration.  But  according  to  the  equivalent  principle, 

space-time contraction should be relative to force and interaction, not a purely relative effect. 

It is obvious that the principle of equivalence contradicts with the principle of space-time relativity. 
Because the principle of equivalence is regarded as the foundation of the Einstein’s theory of gravitation，it 
can be said that special relativity is not consistent with the Einstein’s theory of gravity. Only way for us to 

get rid of this paradox is to give up the relativity of space-time, and admit that space-time contraction is a 

kind of effect caused by accelerating processes. The rational result should be that the perimeter of rotating 
desk contracts and the radio of perimeter and radium is less than  π. No matter who are on rotating desk or 
on ground, observer’s viewpoints are the same.   

 
2. Inertial moving mass and gravitational moving mass are nonequivalent   

Let’s discuss the problem of equivalent principle itself. The principle can be divided two parts, one is 

weak  equivalent  principle  and  another  is  strong  equivalent  principle.  The  weak  equivalent  principle 

indicates that gravitational mass is equivalent with inertial mass, or gravity is equivalent to inertial force 

locally.  We  fist  discuss  the  equivalence  of  gravitational  mass  and  inertial  mass.  Then  discuss  the 

equivalence of gravity and inertial force, as well as the problems of space-time contraction in gravitational 

field and non-inertial reference frame and so do.   

At present, the experiments to prove the equivalence between inertial mass and gravitational mass is 

the  so-called 

sotvoE
&&
&&

  type  of  experiments.  It  can  be  pointed  out  that  this  type  of  experiments  can  not 

expose the equivalence of inertial moving mass and gravitational moving mass actually. According to the 

second law of Newtonian, the force acting on an object is

amF

=

i0

. Here 

0im

  is inertial static mass and   

 

2

a   is acceleration. In a uniform gravitational field, the formula of force can also be written as 

gmF

=

g 0

. 

Here 

0gm

  is gravitational static mass and 

constant is the strength of gravitational field. So we have 

=g

If  gravitational  resting  mass  is  equivalent  with  inertial  resting  mass,  the  radio

would also be a constant.  This result has an obvious defect, i.e., the object’s speed would surpass  light’s 

speed  in  vacuum  at  last  when  the  object  falls  in  the  gravitational  field.  In  order  avoid  this  problem,  the 

dynamic relation of special relativity should be considered. We have

Because the effect of speed on gravitational force is still unknown at present, we suppose

  types  only  verify  the  equivalence  of  gravitational  static  mass  and 
inertial  static mass，without  verifying  the  equivalence  of  gravitational  moving  mass  and inertial  moving 
mass. The relation between them will be deduced in later paper.

On  the  other  hand,  the  weak  principle  of  equivalence  can  also  be  described  as  that  gravitation  is 

locally  equivalent  with inertial  force.  Besides  rotating desk, Einstein used  the ideal  experiment  of  closed 

chamber  to  show  the  equivalence.  In  the  experiments,  observers  in  a  closed  chamber  could  not  decide 

 

3

whether  they  were  at  rest  in  a  uniform  gravitational  field,  or  were  being  accelerated  with  a  uniform 

acceleration.  This  result  is  correct  in  the  Newtonian  theory,  but  can  be  proved  to  be  incorrect  after  the 
dynamic  effect  of  relativity  is  considered.  As  shown  in  Fig.  2.4,  suppose  that  the  chamber  K′   is 
accelerated relative to resting reference frame  K . There is an object  A   with static mass  m   is hanged 
on  the  ceiling  of  chamber  through  an  elastic  rope.  When  K′   is  accelerated  in  a  uniform  acceleration, 
owing  to  the  dynamic  effect  of  special  relativity  as  shown  in  Eq.(2.2),  the  inertial  mass  of  object  would 

become bigger and bigger. So the rope would be pulled longer and longer besides the Lorentz contraction. 

When the speed of chamber is great enough, the inertial force of object would surpass the bearing capacity 

so that the rope would be pulled apart. Because the breaking of rope is an absolute event, observers who are 

inside  and  outside  chamber  would  observe  it.  However,  if  observers  were  at  rest  in  a  static  gravitational 

field, the rope would not be pulled longer and longer and break at last. The observers inside chamber would 

affirm  that  they  are  accelerated,  instead  of  resting  at  a  static  gravitational  field.  It  is  obvious  that  the 

equivalence  of  gravitation  and  inertial  force  is  only  tenable  in  Newtonian  mechanics.  After  the  dynamic 

effect of special relativity is considered, gravitation and inertial force are not equivalent locally.

However,  if  the  concrete  form  of  function 

)Vf
(
satisfied, we can still say that the gravitation and inertial force are still equivalent at a certain extent. The 

  is  determined,  under  the  promise  that  Eq.(3.4)  is 

force acted on an object located on a rotating desk can be equal to a gravitation which does not change with 

time. The force acted on an object located in an accelerated and closed chamber can be equal to gravitation 

which  changes  with  time.  In  fact,  as  we  show  later  that  gravitation  is  only  a  kind  of  special  non-inertial 

force actually.   

The equivalent problems of space-time contractions in gravitational fields and non-inertial reference 

frames  are  discussed  below.  Einstein  used  the  ideal  experiment  of  rotating  desk  to  shown  that  the 

space-time of gravitational field was curved based on equivalent principle. We now discuss this problem.

1t∆   is the time of clocks on rotating desk,

the  principle  of  equivalence,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2.2.,  the  reference  frame  of  uniformly  rotating  desk  is 

equivalent  with  a  static  gravitational  field  which  does  not  change  with  time.  In  the  figure,

centripetal  force  acting  on  clock,

  should be regarded as 

a certain force just as frictional force and so do. This force balances gravitation 

  so that clock can be at 

rest in gravitational field without falling down. So as long as the equivalent principle is tenable, the time

delay of clock which is at rest in gravitational field is expressed by Eq.(2.7). In the 60’s last century, the 

experiments  of  atomic  cesium  clocks  circling  the  earth  had  proved  that  clocks  would  become  slow  in 

gravitational  field.  They  can  be  considered  as  the  direct  proofs  that  the  existence  of  gravitational  fields 

would cause time’s delay. But there still exist a fundamental problem as shown below.   

In atomic cesium clock, time is determined by atomic vibrations. The fact that atomic clock becomes 

slow in gravitational field indicates that the frequency of atomic vibration becomes slow, or the frequency 

of  photon  radiated  by  atom  becomes  slow  and  wave  length  becomes  long  or  red  shift.  According  to  the 

theory of curved space-time, material’s existence causes space-time curved. In general relativity, there is no 

the  concept  of  force.  Particles  are  not  acted  by  force  when  they  move  along  the  geodesic  line  in  curved 

space-time. Therefore, there is no the concept of potential energy for a photon moving in gravitational field. 

The total energy of a photon is equal to its dynamic energy. On the other hand, if the formula 
  is 
always tenable at any point of gravitational field and the frequency  ν   is not a constant,  E   would change 
at different place in gravitational field. In this way, the law of energy conservation of photon would not be 

νhE =

violated. However, the violation of energy conservation is unacceptable, though physicists seem to evade 

this problem at present. It will be shown in later discussion that we can establish gravitational theory in flat 

space-time.  In  the  theory,  photon  would  be  acted  by  gravitation  so  the  concept  of  potential  energy  is 

meaningful.  Based  on  the  theory,  we  can  still  reach  the  same  result  that  gravitational  field  would  cause 

time’ delay without considering the principle of equivalence as a foundation for gravitational theory.   

Now let’s discuss the problem of space bending based on the equivalent principle. According to the 

current theory, when the angle speed of rotating desk is  ω, the space metric of desk is (

It means that length contraction takes place along the tangent direction of desk. Because there is no speed 

along the radium direction, there exists no length contraction in this direction. Otherwise, according to the 

sphere  symmetrical  solution of  the  Einstein’s  equation  of  gravity, the  space part  of  Schwarzschild  metric 

can be written as

fore thin desk, we can let 

Because the slice of sphere is just the desk, so the situation of space bending should be the same. In fact, 
0=θd
in Eq. (2.9). In this case, Eqs.(2.8) and (2.9) should describe the same space metric. How, as we see that 

in Eq.(2.8). For the slice of sphere, we can let 

2/πθ=

0=dz

  and 

 

Eqs.(2.8)  and  (2.9)  are  not  consistent  in  this  case.  In  the  Schwarzschild  metric,  length  contraction  takes 

place in the direction of radium, which is just the direction of gravitation. But in the metric of rotating desk 

Eq.(2.8), length contraction takes place in the tangent direction of desk, instead of the direction of inertial 

force.  It  indicates  that  space  bending  caused  by  non-inertial  force  may  be  different  from  that  caused  by 

gravitation,  if  gravitational  fields  would  also  cause  space  bending  really.  Unfortunately,  this  obvious 

difference  has  not  caused  person’s  attention  up  to  now.  It  is  obvious  that  even  though  the  principle  of 

equivalence  holds  so  that  gravity  would  cause  space  bending,  the  influences  of  non-inertial  force  and 

gravity on space may be different. In fact, it is lack of direct proofs to prove that gravity would cause space 

bending. What we have now is only indirect proofs. We only prove it by calculating object’s motions in the 

gravitational field of the sun. The result is equal to space’s bending at a certain degree. But they are indirect 

 

5

proofs  and  we  need  direct  proofs.  Even  direct  proofs  prove  that  gravity  would  cause  space  bending  in 

future,  as  shown  in  Eq.(2.9),  the  results  may  be  different  from  that  caused  by  non-inertial  force.  In  this 

problem, further theoretical research and experiments are needed. In fact, in the theory of this paper, we can 
establish rational gravitational theory in flat space-time without the concept of curved space.  

Besides, there are many other experiments to show the impossibility of weak equivalent principle. For 

example, when a closed chamber is at rest on a uniformly rotating desk, there exists the Coriolis force for a 

moving object, the inertial gyroscope would change its direction and charged objects would radiate photons. 

But  in  a  static  gravitational field, there  are  no  such phenomena.  Observers  can distinguish both  to  be on 

rotating  desk  or  at  rest  in  a  uniform  gravitational  field  by  theses  phenomena.  The  problem  of  weak 

equivalence  is  very  complex.  Sometime  it  is  effective,  sometime  it  is  wrong.  Sometime  it  contains 

something specious. So it is improper to take it as a fundamental principle of physics. 
 
3. Impossibility of the principles of strong equivalence and general relativity 
        The  strong  equivalent  principle  can  be  described  as  that  for  any  space-time  point  in  a  gravitational 

field by taking the local inertial reference frame, the forms of nature laws are the same with that when the 

Descartes reference frame is taken without gravitational field and acceleration. Or speaking directly, in a 

local reference frame which is falling freely in a gravitational field, gravitation would be eliminated. This 

seems  to  be  a  well-known  experimental  fact.  Then,  is  the  strong  equivalent  principle  tenable?  The 

following analysis shows that this is only an apparent feeling of mankind and is wrong actually.   

In order to explain it, we need to establish the concepts of “integral force” and “non-integral force”. 

So-called “integral force” indicates that the force acted on an object is distributed uniformly over all parts 

of the object, even over every atoms and elemental particles of the object. “Non-integral force” indicates 

that the force is only acted on a part of the object. It is obvious that gravitation is “integral force”, but the 

force acted on an observer who is at rest in non-inertial reference frame is non-integral force. For example, 

when an observer stands on an accelerated train, the force acted on him actually acts on his feet and the feet 

draw the body of observer moving forward. The other parts of body, not being acted directly by the force, 

are still in internal state, so that the body moves backward. In this way, so-called inertial force is caused. In 

an accelerating elevator, the force is only acted on observer’s feet directly. Then the force is contributed to 

whole body through feet. For observers on rotating desk, friction force between feet and desk is need so 

that the observer can stand on desk. The friction force is also acted on feet directly. All of these forces are 

non-integral  forces.  It  is  just  owing  to  the  action  of  this  kind  of  non-inertial  force,  non-equilibrium  or 

internal stress is caused in observer’s body so that observer can feel the existence of accelerating motion. It 

should be pointed out that “integral force” is only a macro-concept. Such as friction force, the essence of 

“non-integral force” is electromagnetic force. From micro-angle, however, all interactions between micro- 

particles are integral. 

It is clear that the force acted on an object in uniform gravitational field is integral one. The inertial 

force  caused  by  non-inertial  motion  is  also  integral  force  in  general.  The  problem  is  now  that  when  a 

non-integral  force  is  distributed  over  whole  body  of  observer  who  is  at  rest  in  a  non-inertial  reference 
frame，what would happen? As shown in Fig. 3.1, the centripetal force acted on the feet of observer who is 
at  rest  on  rotating  desk  is  friction  force  actually.  If  this  friction  force  is  distributed  over  each  part  of 

observer’s  body,  the  observer  would  not  fell  this  force’s  action.  We  can  see  in  Fig.3.2  from  the  angle  of 

non-inertial reference frame, this uniformly distributive friction force would be uniformly counteracted by 

the uniformly distributive inertial force. In this case, the observer who is at rotating desk seems to be at rest

in a static inertial reference frame without any force’s action, though he is actually accelerated. He may also 

think that he is falling in a gravitational field, just as an astronaut travels in the orbit of cincturing earth.   

So it is only a subjective feeling that observer was not acted by force when he fell freely in a uniform 

gravitational field. The true is that the force acted on observer’s body is integral force which is distributed 

over observer’s body uniformly. In this way, no internal stress is produced in observer’s body so that he can 

not fell the action of gravitational force and the existence of acceleration. Physiology tells us that felling is 

caused by non-uniformity. No felling does not indicate no changing. If changing is uniform and slow, there 

would  be  no  felling.  If  proper  methods  are  used,  surpassing  subjective  felling,  the  observer  would  find 

himself to be being accelerated when he falls freely in a uniform gravitational field. For example, a charged 

object would radiate photons when it falls freely in a gravitational field, but the object would not when it is 

at  rest  in  inertial  reference  frame.  So  only  by  taking  a  charged  object  with  himself,  the  observer  would 

judge whether he is falling freely in a uniform gravitational field or at rest in inertial reference frame. Only 

by  this  fact,  the  principle  of  strong  equivalence  has  been  proved  untenable.  More  important  is  that 

comparing  with  static  inertial  reference  frame,  moving  ruler’s  length  would  contract  and  moving  clock’s 

time would become slow as well as moving object’s mass would increase absolutely. The forms of nature 

laws  are  different  in  both  the  freely  falling  reference  frames  of  gravitational  fields  and  in  the  Descartes 

inertial reference frame. 

Einstein  denied  the  existence  of  absolutely  resting  reference  frame  by  establishing  special  relativity, 

thought  that  all  inertial  reference  frames  were  equivalent  for  the  description  of  nature  phenomena.  After 

that, he introduced the principle of general relativity again to eliminate the superiority of inertial reference 

frame, thought that all reference frames with arbitrary moving forms were equivalent for the description of 

nature  phenomena.  In  mathematics,  the  principle  of  general  relativity  can  be  described  as  that  the  basic 

forms  of  motion  equations  should  be  covariant,  or  the  line  element  of  arbitrary  reference  frames  must 

satisfy relation 

=2ds

constant. This demand is rational, for it actually represents the general form of the 

invariability principle of light’s speed under the condition of non-inertial transformations. But it does not 

mean that the forms of forces acted on objects are the same. As we known, in the general three dimension 

space,  the  motion  equations  can  be  transformed  into  other  forms  by  introducing  arbitrary  coordinate 

transformations  without  bring  any  practical  physical  result,  for  there  are  no  any  force  or  acceleration  is 

introduced.  But  in  the  four  dimension  space-time,  the  situation  is  completely  different.  In  the  four 

dimension space-time, if the transformation is linear just as the Lorenz transformation, velocity would be 

introduced. But if the transformations are arbitrary, accelerations or non-inertial forces would be introduced 

in motion equations. In this way, there still exists a superior reference frame actually, i.e., inertial reference 

frame, in which motion equation has simplest form without the existence of inertial force. 

In  the  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravity,  non-inertial  motions  are  considered  to  be  equal  to  gravitational 

fields. In this situation, many problems are caused. At present, based on the principle of general relativity 

that any reference frame is equivalent to describe a physical system, when the coordinate transformation is 

carried  out  for  a  solution  of  gravitational  field’s  equation,  it  is  thought  that  the  solution  with  new  form 

would still be effective to describe the original gravitational field. However, even according to the principle 

of  equivalence,  this  is  also  impossible.  If  non-inertial  reference  frame  is  equivalent  locally  with 

gravitational field, a special non-inertial reference frame can be only equal to a special gravitational field, 

with the corresponding relation of one by one. So when a non-inertial reference frame is transformed into 

another one, it means that a gravitational field is transformed into another one with different nature. That is 

to  say,  because  inertial  forces  are  considered  to  be  equal  to  gravities,  the  general  transformation  in  the

space-time of four dimensions would change gravitational fields. For a certain gravitational field, suppose 

we have obtained its solution by solving the Einstein’s equation. If the coordinate transformation is carried 

out, the form of field’s equation and the solution are changed. The result means that the original field has 

been  transformed  into  new  gravitational  field,  and  new  solution  would  not  be  original  one.  So  a  certain 

gravitational  field  can  only  correspond  to  a  certain  metric.  Arbitrary  coordinate  transformation  in  the 

space-time  of  four  dimensions  is  not  allowed,  unless  in  new  reference  frame,  the  same  result  can  be 

obtained.  However,  this  is  impossible  in  general.  For  example,  we  can  not  re-calculate  the  perihelion 

precession of Mercury as well as other problems in the Lemaite and Kruskal coordinate systems and get the 

same result as we do in the Schwarzschild coordinate system. In fact, the reason that the energy-momentum 

tensors of gravitational field can not be defined well at present is actually owing to the existence of strong 

equivalent  principle.  According  to  the  principle,  we  can  always  introduce  same  local  inertial  reference 

frames  through  coordinate  transformations,  in  which  gravitational  fields  would  be  eliminated  and  the 

energy-momentum  tensors  of  gravitational  fields  also  become  zero.  However,  according  to  the  law  of 

energy-momentum  conservation,  a  static  system’s  energy  and  momentum  should  be  constants.  How  can 

they be canceled only by coordinate transformations?   

Therefore,  it  can  be  said  clearly  that  no  relativity  and  arbitrarily  are  allowed  in  the  description  of 

gravity.  The  description  of gravitational  theory  demands  absolution. The  principle of  general  relativity  is 

untenable. The demand that the forms of motion equations should be covariant in arbitrary reference frames 

is  only  a  basic  restriction  for  the  transformations  of  motion  equations.  It  does  not  indicate  that  the 

descriptions  of  physical  processes  are  the  same  in  arbitrary  reference  frames.  In  fact,  only  in  inertial 

reference  frames,  the  basic  forms  of  motion  equations  can  be  the  same.  And  as  mentioned  in  the  paper 

“Absoluteness  of  Velocity  Produced  by  Accelerating  Process  and  Absolute  Space-time  Theory  with 

Variable  Scales”,  only  in  the  absolute  reference  frame,  the  descriptions  of  physical  processes  are  the 

simplest and most symmetrical.   

At  last,  we  should  point  out  that  the  free  falling  of  reference  frames  in  gravitational  field  is  only 

general accelerating motion. The force causing acceleration is only special one---- gravity. The result is that 

relative to resting reference frame, in accelerating reference frame, length would contract and time would 

delay and mass would increase. All of those are the normal effects of special relativity. Therefore, as long 

as we know the interaction form between gravitational field and material, we can describe object’s motions 

in gravitational fields by the dynamic method of special relativity. The description is in flat space-time. It is 

unnecessary to us to introduce the equation of gravitational fields in curved space-time. This problem will 

be discussed in next paper. 

  It is obvious that though the Einstein’s theory of gravity has reached great success, there are many 

problems  existing  in  its  logical  foundation  and  theoretical  configuration.  We  should  renovate  our  ideas 

about the essence of space-time and gravity.

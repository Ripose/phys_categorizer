ABSTRACT 

The formation of plasma crystals confined in an external one-dimensional parabolic potential 

well is simulated for a normal experimental environment employing a computer code called 

BOX_TREE. Under appropriate conditions, crystals were found to form layered systems. The 

system’s structural phase transitions, including transitions between crystals with differing 

numbers of layers and the same number of layers but different intralayer structures, were 

investigated and found to agree with previous theoretical and experimental research results. 

1-2 layer transitions were examined in detail and shown to be caused by an out-of-plane lattice 

instability. Finally, growth rates for this out-of-plane lattice instability were obtained using the 

Box_Tree simulation with these results shown to agree with those obtained from analytical 

theory.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 

 

In a typical experiment on earth (under gravity), a plasma crystal is formed within a 

complex plasma when dust particles are levitated in the sheath region due to a balance 

between the gravitational and electrostatic force of a rf discharge [1-3]. The total external 

potential in this sheath region has been shown experimentally to approximate a parabolic 

potential well [4], thus it can be modeled as [5]

where z is the particle height and µ is the parabolic coefficient. 

In most cases, the particles will become negatively charged due to electron collection. 

However, this charge will be shielded by the ambient plasma thus the interaction between 

particles is best represented by a repulsive Yukawa potential defined by

where q is the particle charge, r is the distance between any two particles and λD is the dust 

Debye length. 

Structural phase transitions were first investigated by D. Dubin for a two dimensional One 

Component Plasma (OCP) system [6]. More recently, it has been proposed that an instability 

of the out-of-plane Dust Lattice Wave (DLW) [7-10] in a single-layer system may be the cause 

for the 1-2 layer transition. Such transitions have been observed in experiments on both OCP 

systems [11] and colloidal suspensions [12]. For plasma crystals, structural phase transitions 

have not yet been experimentally observed but have been investigated theoretically by H. 

Totsuji [5] employing a confined Yukawa system as a model. Totsuji established a phase 

diagram [5] for such a system characterized by two dimensionless parameters, κ and η. The 

shielding parameter κ is defined by

where q is the charge on the grain and µ is the parabolic coefficient as defined above. 

In this research, the formation of a plasma crystal modeled by a vertically confined 

Yukawa system will be simulated using a numerical code called Box_Tree [9, 13-15]. The 

structural phase transitions will be investigated and compared with previous research results. 

The dispersion relation for the out-of-plane DLW will be obtained for a single-layer system, 

showing that the out-of-plane dust lattice instability appears at the point where the 1-2 layer 

transition starts [16]. This out-of-plane dust lattice instability will be examined with the 

instability growth rates calculated from Box_Tree simulations conducted for varying values of 

η. The dispersion relation for the out-of-plane DLW obtained using an analytical method [9] 

will also be used to calculate these growth rates and these analytical results will be compared 

to the simulation results.

  and 0.61, respectively. Neutral gas drag is included with an Epstein 

drag coefficient [17] 

β

. The boundary conditions in the XY directions are 

1
−

considered to be periodic since the box employed has a size much smaller than the size of the 

plasma crystal produced in a typical experimental environment. The boundary condition on 

the Z direction is assumed to be a closed boundary condition with particles hitting the top or 

bottom boundaries of the box reflected under an elastic collision. 

Crystallization of the complex (dusty) plasma is simulated via the formation of an ordered 

crystal from an initially random distribution of particles placed in the box. Simulations were 

conducted for the range 

0.48

≥≥η

0.0034

. As η decreases from 0.48 to 0.0034, the crystal 

transitions from a single-layer system to a two, three, four and five-layer system [16] with the 

system existing as a single layer system for 

0.48

and a five-layer system for

≥≥η

. 

Between any two consecutive stages there is a structural phase transition. While within 

each stage, as η decreases the number of layers remains constant, the symmetry within each 

layer changes from a square to a hexagonal (triangular) lattice. Between these symmetries, 

there is a transition stage where the lattice exhibits a complex structure showing a mixture of 

both square and hexagonal symmetry [16]. All of the above agree with previous theoretical [5, 

6] and experimental [11, 12] results. 

As can be seen in Fig. 1, for both square and hexagonal symmetry the vertical projection 

of a particle within one layer always falls onto the center of the lattice cell in the adjacent layer. 

As can also be seen in Fig. 1(b) and (d) for hexagonal lattices, particles within the third layer 

are primarily aligned vertically with particles in the first layer. This is characteristic of an hcp 

lattice, in which particle positions within a hexagonal lattice plane repeat themselves every 

other plane; thus the planes are ordered as ABABAB ….   

In fact, the fcc phase, for which the lattice planes are ordered as ABCABC …, is the 

thermodynamically preferred state for a layered hexagonal structure since its Helmholtz free 

energy is smaller. However, for a Yukawa interaction with short range, the difference between 

the free energies of the fcc and hcp phases is very small, and local fluctuations of the particle 

density might result in a transition from the fcc to the hcp phase [18]. This is presumably why 

the hcp rather than the fcc structure was observed. 

 

No vertical alignment was seen in any of the simulations. This is to be expected since the 

vertical alignment observed in plasma crystal experiments on earth is created by the ion flow 

wake effect while the system considered by this research is a pure Yukawa system [16]. 

The relative thickness of the system was also investigated as a function of η [16]. A 

general increase in thickness as η decreases and discontinuities in the d-η function 

corresponding to the stepwise transitions in the number of layers N can be clearly seen in Fig. 

2. Also shown is the dependence of the intralayer structures on η. It can be seen that the 

structural phase transitions and the d-η function are in agreement quantitatively with Totsuji’s 

predictions [5]. 

 

 

3. 1-2 LAYER TRANSITION 

As can be seen from the d-η function (Fig. 2) the 1-2 layer transition is characterized by a 

dramatic increase in overall system thickness. In Ref. [6], it was shown that for an OCP, a 

single layer system would first go through a 1-3 layer transition caused by the out-of-plane 

lattice instability. As η decreases, the 3-layer system will then change to a 2-layer system via a 

first order phase transition. To examine the 1-2 layer transition (which begins when 

432.0

≥≥η

408.0

) in greater detail, Box_Tree simulations were conducted with a fine 

adjustment of η values around the transition point, for the range 

444.0

≥≥η

.0

418

. The 

corresponding d-η function is shown in Fig. 3(a). As can be seen, the critical value of η 

signifying the start of the 1-2 layer transition falls between 

430.0

≥ criticalη

≥

.0

427

. 

The dispersion relation for the out-of-plane lattice wave has recently been derived using 

an analytical method [9] as

The condition, which must be met for instability in the out-of-plane lattice wave to occur, is 

for Eq. 5 to have a complex solution for ω. When this happens, the dispersion relation of the 

wave propagating parallel to the prime translation vector intersects the 

0=ω   axis [6]. 

Using Eq. 5, the dispersion relation for the out-of-plane lattice wave propagating parallel 

to the prime translation vector was found [16] to intersect the 

0=ω   axis when 

≤µ

  (which corresponds to 

.0≤η

4274

). The solid line in Fig. 3(b) shows 

this theoretical dispersion relation when η is equal to the threshold value of 0.4274. 

A Box_Tree simulation was also run for this value of η and then employing the method in 

[9], the dispersion relation of the out-of-plane lattice wave was represented by an intensity 

graph for the particle velocities in k-ω space (Fig. 3(b)). As can be seen, the two methods 

agree well (Fig. 3(b)) with both showing the threshold value of η for the out-of-plane lattice 

instability as 0.4274. Comparing this value of η with the critical value of η signifying the start 

of the 1-2 layer transition, 

430.0

≥ criticalη

≥

427.0

, it is verified that for a vertically confined 

Yukawa system the 1-2 layer transition starts at the point where an instability of the 

out-of-plane lattice wave (or out-of-plane lattice instability) appears [16]. 

There is some evidence that the 3-layer structure caused by the out-of-plane lattice 

instability as predicted in Ref [6] might be visible at the center of the layered system for 

.0=η

4056

  (Fig. 4). The fact that it only appears at the center of the layered system is 

presumably due to the artificial periodic boundary conditions employed in the simulation. 

 

 

4. THE OUT-OF-PLANE LATTICE INSTABILITY 

The growth rate of the out-of-plane lattice instability is described by the imaginary part ωi 

of the complex frequency ω. Eq. 5 was solved for 

.0≤η

4274

  and the complex solution for ω 

was obtained. The real (ωr) and imaginary (ωi) parts of this solution as a function of the wave 

number k for 

.0=η

420

, 0.408, 0.396 and 0.384 are shown in Fig. 5. 

From Fig. 5(b), it can be seen that the maximum growth rates occur for waves with wave 

number  k = 6.4mm−1  and 

k

=

8.12

mm

1
−

  and that only waves whose wave numbers fall 

within a specific range around these two values will have a positive growth rate. All other 

waves exhibit a small constant negative growth rate, which is caused by damping due to 

neutral gas drag. Both the growth rates and the range of allowable wave numbers for growing 

waves increase as η decreases. 

To verify these analytical predictions, Box_Tree simulations for time-dependent η values 

were conducted. The simulations were started with a η value of 0.432, which is greater than 

the threshold value of 0.4274, thus insuring there would be no out-of-plane lattice instability 

or 1-2 layer transition. After 65 seconds the system stabilized as a single layer crystal. At this 

time η was changed to a value below the threshold value of 0.4274, at which point 

out-of-plane lattice instabilities appeared. 

These instabilities, or growing waves were then detected and investigated by analyzing 

the output data from Box_Tree. Particle motion was tracked for approximately 1 second after 

the change of η with output data files created every 0.001-second with a total of 1000 data files 

obtained. Once this data was collected, the x-y plane of the box for each set of particles was 

divided into bins. For each data file the average vertical displacement from equilibrium for the 

particles within each bin was determined, yielding a matrix of positions with column number 

equal to the number of bins and line number equal to the number of data files. Since each file 

was collected at a specific time, and particles within each bin had a specific x coordinate, this 

position matrix yields particle displacements, which are both time (t) and position (x) 

dependent. This is the same method employed in [9] except that vertical displacements instead 

of velocities are considered. Since the simulation results were to be compared with growth 

rates for waves propagating parallel to the prime translation vector, the bins were chosen 

perpendicular to it [9].

Since this matrix was obtained from the random particle motion on the vertical direction, 

it represents the time dependence of the magnitude of the thermally excited out-of-plane 

lattice waves for various wave numbers. As shown in Fig. 6, this data can be represented by an 

intensity graph in k-t space, where the magnitude of the waves is given by pixel brightness. 

Fig. 6 shows an intensity graph obtained from a simulation for 

.0=η

408

  after the 

system stabilized as a single layer crystal. It can be seen that for waves with k values of 

approximately 6 and 13, the magnitude increases with time, while waves with other k values 

do not show any apparent growth. To determine whether the range of k values for growing 

waves agrees with that found analytically, the theoretical growth rate curve obtained for 

408.0=η

  is superimposed on the right side of the graph. As can be seen, the range of wave 

numbers for growing waves is in good agreement with the analytical results. 

The behavior of the waves can be seen more clearly by plotting the magnitude of a 

specific wave with a particular wave number as a function of time. This is shown for 

36.2=k

 

and 

07.7=k

  in Fig. 7 (a) and (b) respectively. As can be clearly seen, for 

36.2=k

, the 

magnitude of the wave is small (below 

2.1

) and random, while for 

07.7=k

, the 

magnitude exhibits a smooth increase for the first 

s5.0

  and then stabilizes with a value of 

approximately 

0.5

×

m410
−

  for the second 

s5.0

. It can also be seen that the increase of 

magnitude is almost exponential, as would be expected from instability theory. Thus, the 

growth rate can be determined by employing an exponential fit to the increasing portion of the 

curve. Doing so shows the growth rate to be 

iω

=

  as compared to that found from 

analytical theory, where it was

. 

Growth rates for out-of-plane lattice instabilities (growing waves) for 

.0=η

420

, 0.396 

and 0.384 have also been determined using this method and are shown in Fig. 8 along with 

those for 

408.0=η

. Only growth-rates for waves with wave numbers of approximately 

4.6=k

  are calculated since the magnitude of waves with 

8.12=k

  are too small to show any 

reasonable increase. Also, only data showing a smooth increase in wave magnitude within the 

first half second are used. The analytical results for these η values are also shown in Fig. 8. As 

can be seen, the analytical prediction that the growth rate increases with decreasing η is 

verified by the simulation data. Although, the average percentage difference between the 

simulation and the analytical results is approximately 20%, calculations show that this 

difference most likely arises from round-up error of the simulations. Another possible error 

comes from the fact that for small η (

400.0<η

), the system stabilizes after approximately 0.5 

second, exhibiting a rough two-layer shape. Since the analytical prediction is made based on 

the assumption that the system is a single-layer system, a deviation from the analytical 

prediction is to be expected. 

 

 

5. CONCLUSIONS 

The structural phase transitions within a plasma crystal modeled as a vertically confined 

Yukawa system, including both transitions between different numbers of layers and intralayer 

structures were simulated using the Box_Tree code. The generated results agree with previous 

theoretical and experimental results. 

Box_Tree was also employed to investigate both the 1-2 layer transition and the 

out-of-plane instability for a vertically confined Yukawa system. The critical value of η for the 

onset of the 1-2 transition and the η value where the out-of-plane lattice instability begins to 

appear were both determined by an analysis of the out-of-plane lattice wave using both 

analytical and simulation methods. The values of η obtained were shown to agree with one 

another thus showing that for a Yukawa system, the transition starts at the point where the 

out-of-plane lattice instability appears. The resulting 3-layer system caused by this instability 

was observed at the center of the system. The out-of-plane lattice instability was itself 

examined and growth rates obtained for systems with differing η values again using both 

analytical and simulation methods. The growth rate values obtained were found to agree and 

both methods showed that for all η values investigated, the highest growth rates occurred for 

waves with wave number 

k

=

4.6

mm

  and 

k

=

8.12

mm

. Only waves whose wave

numbers fall within a η dependent range around these two values can become instabilities, or 

growing waves.

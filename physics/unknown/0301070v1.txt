The solution of problem on distribution of static head along the pipe flowing element is 
submitted. The solution is reached on the basis of consideration of contact interaction of gas 
and liquid stream with the wall of the pipe flowing element. The expression for distribution of 
static head along the pipe flowing element is obtained on the basis of usage of three 
fundamental laws in fluid dynamics: Torricelli formula, Weissbach-Darcy formula and 
Bernoulli equation. The general solution is obtained for a gas stream. The special case of the 
obtained solution is retrieved for liquid stream.

1 Introduction 
 
The  creating  of  physically  substantial  bases  of  the  fluid 
medium  motion  theory  envisions  overcoming  the  set  of 
problems  and  solution  of  series  of  attendant  questions. 
The  problem  of  determination  of  distribution  of  the 
energy potential along the pipe flowing element or system 
is  one  of  fundamental  in  this  area.  The  essence  of  this 
problem lies in the fact to define an unitized mathematical 
expression,  which  will  physically  adequately  and

technical  exactly  determine  the  distribution  of  energy 
potential applied to the flowing element or system and it 
will  be  equally  fairly  for  liquid  and  gas  streams.  In 
applied  sense  it  means  to  determine  of  the  law  of  static 
head  distribution  along  the  pipe  flowing  element  or 
system.  
 

2 Approach 
 
For  the  solution  of  the  problem  the  authors  utilized:  the 
formula for free fall setting by proceedings of Torricelli - 
Galilei (1643) and Borda - Du Buat (1766), the formulae 
for  determination  of  friction  losses  at  motion  of  liquid 
stream  in  pipe  of  Weissbach-Darcy  (1857)  and  local 
losses  of  Weissbach  (1865)  and  also  the  equation  of 
conservation of energy (density of energy is more exact) 
for  stream  in  pipe  by  Bernoulli  principle  (1738)  in  the 
form  that  conform  to  the  end  of  ХIХ  century.  The 
sufficiency of these dependences for reaching an object is 
determined by their stated below distinctions. Torricelli - 
Galilei - Borda - Du Buat (TGBD) formula represents the 
historically  first  equation  of  conservation  of  energy  for 
motion  of  solid  or  medium  without  contact  interaction. 
The  path  of  development  of  this  formula  from  the 
moment  of  an  experimental  research  up  to  physically 
correct  record  was  required  almost  150  years  (Du  Buat) 
and up to usage in equation of conservation of energy was 
required  additional  almost  120  years.  This  formula  has 
passed  inspection  in  general  mechanics  and  then  in 
mechanics  of  fluid  medium  and  it  is  one  of  fundamental 
in  mechanics.  Weissbach-Darcy’s  formula  represents  the 
historically first modification of TGBD formula for fluid 

medium  motion  with  taking  into  account  of  contact 
interaction (with pipe wall). This formula is obtained also 
on  the  basis  of  experimental  research  and  reflects  the 
approach  to  a  viewing  of  motion  indicated  by  Aristotle 
(328  В.С.)  as  the  third  problem  of  his  «Mechanical 
problems». The fundamentality of taking into account of 
contact  interaction  called  simplistically  as  hydraulic 
friction is affirmed not only Aristotle's prevision but also 
that  this  formula  became  an  inalienable  part  of  equation 
of  conservation  of  energy  for  fluid  flow  in  pipe. 
Weissbach's  formula  is  modification  of  Weissbach-
Darcy's  formula  and  allows  to  determine  the  different 
shape local resistances at fluid medium motion in flowing 
system. 

The fundamental character of equation of conservation of 
energy for stream of fluid medium in flowing element or 
system,  apparently,  cannot  call  doubt,  and  furthermore 
this equation is constructed on above-mentioned laws.  

The principle of conservation of energy at motion without 
contact  interaction  and  the  principle  of  consumptions  of 
energy  for  contact  interaction  at  motion  is  harmonic 
combined  in  this  equation.  The  last  reflects  even  more 
severe  sense,  connected  with  self-organizing  of  stream 
with minimum of energy consumption that applied to the 
flowing system. 
 

3 Solution 
 
So, TGBD formula may be written in the form:

where  h   represents simultaneously part of not yet passed 
path  by  impinging  body  and  part  of  residual  potential 
energy  and    Н    represents  simultaneously  all  path  of 
falling  and  available  initial  value  of  potential  energy.  In 
such aspect this formula allows to determine the quantity 
of  kinetic  energy  of  falling  body  in  dependence  on 
relative part of passed path of falling. 

In its turn Weissbach-Darcy’s formula in the form:

the  pipe  depending  on

intensity  of  contact 
along 
interaction  of  fluid  with  wall.  The  reference  point  of 
current  length  of  stream  start  from  inlet  section  of  pipe

just  as  the  reference  point  of  current  fall  height  in  the 
TGBD formula start from point of falling.

The equation of conservation of energy for liquid stream

The  expression  (5)  determines  distribution  of  static  head 
in stream of fluid medium in pipe. 

According  to  expression  (4)  for  liquid  the  equality  is 
valid:

From equality (6) it is follows necessity to accept  Кl = 1,  
executable  by    l  =  0,  what  corresponds  to  the  outlet 
section  of  pipe.  Therefore  for  liquid  the  distribution  of 
static head along pipe has accordingly kind:

and  testifies  about  linear  change  of  static  head along the 
stream length in pipe according to change of the fraction 
numerator in its right member. 

In  contrast  to  this,  expression  (5)  possess  the  generality 
and is applied to stream of gas medium in pipe. Presence

both  in  numerator  and  in  denominator  of  fraction  in  a 
right  member  of  expression  (5)  specifies  the  nonlinear 
character  of  static head change in gas stream in pipe. At 
the same time the diminution of quantity of static head in 
gas stream in direction of outlet from pipe happens more 
and  more  intensively.  Physically  it  means  increasing  of 
velocity  of  gas  stream  to  outlet  from  pipe  with  constant 
values  of  cross  section  and  coefficient  of  hydraulic 
friction.  Such  differences  of  physical  characteristics  of 
(reversible) 
liquid  as  a  major  elastic 
gas 
compressibility  and  a  major  kinematical  viscosity  in 
combination  with  small  heat  capacity  stipulate  the 
consecutive  transformation  of  friction  work  to  the  heat, 
which one, in turn, stipulates the consecutive increase of 
gas  stream  velocity  along  the  pipe  of  uniform  cross 
section.  In  distribution  of  static  head  along  the  pipe  for 
liquid  and  gas,  the  common  is  that  the  initial  and  final 
values  of  static  head  can  be  the  same  for  these  two 
mediums.  The  difference  is,  that  at  the  mentioned 
identity,  the  curve  of  static  head  of  gas  stream  between 
points    рst(0)  =  p0    and    рst(L)  =  ph    is  situated  above  a 
straight line of static head of liquid stream. 

In problem about free fall in gravity field, the velocity of 
body is increased on the way of the fall under stationary 
value of gravity acceleration. In problem about motion of 
gas  stream  in  pipe  the  flow  velocity  is  increased  under 
stationary  value of intensity of contact interaction of gas 
stream  with  surface.  Such  acceleration  of  gas  stream 
motion is the frictional self-acceleration. 
 

4 Discussion 
 
Lately, the analogous object was pursued by Duxbury in 
his work [1]. The equation derived by this author contains 
the link of pressure drop along the pipe with  the mass 
flow rate of fluid. The link is not immediate because it 
requires to introduce the discharge coefficient as the 
additional empirical factor defined experimentally. 
Furthermore, the link of pressure drop with flow rate is 
complicated by the necessity of determination of density 
of fluid at the beginning and end of stream as well as an 
average quantity in conditions of essential non-linear 
nature of the change of the pressure drop along the pipe. 
The mentioned imperfections is a consequence of the 
physically inferior approach based on balance of the 
forces but not the equation of conservation of energy. 
Therefore equation for determination of pressure drop 
along the pipe derived in [1] as many other attempts

before him no possess the attributes of the static head law 
along the pipe flowing element. 

5 Congruence of results 
 
The obtained expressions (5) and (7) are used as basis for 
working out of mathematical algorithm and then VeriGas 
program  for  computing  of 
the  state  and  motion 
parameters  of  gas  stream  in  the  diverse  flowing  element 
and  its  systems.  The  computational  results  are  tested  by 
means  of  comparison  with  experimental  data  of  a  great 
many of sources of the specialized literature.  

In  particular, 
that  overstated 
it  was  determined, 
experimental curve of static head approximately on 5% in 
contrast  to  our  computations,  inserted  in the book [2], is 
explained  that  the  pipe  termed  in  the  book  text  as  a 
smooth  really  had  19  static  head  measurement  orifices. 
Thus, the comparison has given result not for the benefit 
of experiment. There is a lot of such examples in papers 
and monographies [3,4,5]. 
 

6 Final remark 
 
The  expressions  shown  in  this  paper  have  a  key  nature, 
therefore their deduction is submitted in one-dimensional 
stationary  statement.  At  the  same  time,  results  of 
computational  experiments  that  repeatedly  realized  does 
not  yield  to  experimental  results  on  regularity  and 
precision.

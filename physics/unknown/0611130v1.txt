The importance of the power law has been well realized in econophysics over the last decade1.

For instance, the distribution of the rate of stock price variation2 and of personal assets3 show

the power law. While these results reveal the striking scale invariance of ﬁnancial markets,

the behaviour of price in real economy is less known in spite of its extreme importance. As

an example of markets in real economy, here we take up the price of precious stones which

increases with size while the amount of their production rapidly decreases with size. We show

for the ﬁrst time that the price of natural precious stones (quartz crystal ball, gemstones

such as diamond, emerald, and sapphire) as a function of weight obeys the power law. This

indicates that the price is determined by the same evaluation measure for different sizes.

Our results demonstrate that not only the distribution of an economical observable but also

the price itself obeys the power law. We anticipate our ﬁndings to be a starting point for

the quantitative study of scale invariance in real economy. While the Black–Sholes model

provided the framework for optimal pricing in ﬁnancial markets 4, our method of analysis

prvides a new framework that characterizes the market in real economy.

We took the price data of precious stones from on-line jewelers, considering their public

1

accessibility. First we analyse the selling price of diamonds published in a database, which takes

the price lists from a number of jewelers 5. We should note that the price of diamonds depend not

only on the weight (measured in unit of Carat: 1 Ct = 0.2 gram) but also on the clarity, colour,

and cut, according to which the stones are strictly categorized. To remove the dependence on

the factors other than the weight, we use only the data of top quality (i.e. ﬂawless and internally

ﬂawless, colour: D) diamonds with a round brilliant cut.

Fig.1 describes how the selling price

scales with the weight

in double logarithmic plot.

We ﬁnd that the price has power law dependence on weight:

. Here we stress that

the exponent (slope of the curve), but not the prefactor of the power law, describes the trend of

the graph. The exponent larger than unity means that the unit price (per weight) becomes highr

for larger stones. If the exponent equals to 1, it means that the price is purely proportional to the

weight, which is unlikely if we consider the rare production of large homogeneous crystals.

As examples of colour gemstones, we chose round blue sapphire and emerald, and plotted in

Fig.2 their price as a function of weight. We ﬁnd that they also obey the power law

with

the exponents

(sapphire) and

(emerald), which are very close

to each other but clearly smaller than that of the diamond. Thus, the exponent depends on the type

of precious stones, but it might take a close value for similar type of stones. It is suggested that

the price of more precious stones like diamond has higher exponent. The scale invariance of the

price (i.e. power law) for different sizes means that the same evaluation rule is used in the price

determination. The origin of power law could be attributed to the balance between total cost of

production and consumer’s demand.

Fig.3 describes the price of quartz crystal ball for differnt weights. In this case the price range

can be divided into three scaling regimes. For small weights, the exponent is

. It

means that the unit price is higher for smaller stones, which might be due to the extra costs such as

packaging or human resources. In the second regime with the price ranging from

to

JPY,

the power law is very accurate with the exponent

. Also, the crossover from the

ﬁrst to second regime is quite sharp. At the end of the second regime the price suddenly becomes

higher by a factor or about 3, resulting in discrete jump to the third regime, which is characterized

by the exponent

. Note that the jump affects the prefactor of the power law, while

the exponents for the two regimes are identical within the error bar. It is remarkable that a single

exponent describes the trend of the graph for the price range of over 5 decades. The jump might

be explained by the fact that the data for the third regime are for the crystal balls that are currently

out of stock.

In Figure 4 we show the price of diamond at a retail company 8. The data can be divided

into 5 or 6 groups according to the weight and in each group the price exhibits a band structure,

which reﬂects the difference in clarity and colour. Fitting to all the data points gives the exponent

, while in each group, the price of top quality (internally ﬂawless) samples obeys

a power law with exponent close to 1, and jumps to the next group. The latter features suggest

that the smooth power law behavior is strongly modiﬁed by the company. However, the overall

power law tells that the market on a large-scale is determined by the balance between production

and demand.

The method presented in this work may be usefully extended to quantitative analysis of other

3

markets in real economy. The power law might be a sign of self-organization in a market with high

ﬂuidity and competition.

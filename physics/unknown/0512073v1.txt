Abstract 
In  this  paper  we  proposed  a  novel  overlay  alignment  method  using  two  sets  of 
identical photonic crystals (PhCs). In this method the reflection or transmission 
spectrum of the two overlaid photonic crystals is measured to help wafer tilt, yaw 
rotation,  and  translation  aligning.  The  initial  testing  results  with  two  1D 
photonic  crystals  and  analysis  of  the  alignment  accuracy  are  presented.  This 
method 
in  building  photonic  crystal  stacks  with 
is  particularly  useful 
nanoimprint lithography (NIL). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1. Introduction 

Accurate overlay alignment between two layers of patterns is extremely important in 

lithography. Traditional alignment methods include direct comparison of two sets of 

marks, Morie patterns of two sets of gratings with slightly different periods [1], and 

diffractions  of  two  sets  of  gratings  with  an  identical  period.  These  traditional 

alignment  methods  do  not  provide  high  accuracy  tilt  alignment  between  two  wafers 

that  is  very  important  to  NIL.  Here  a  novel  overlay  alignment  method  with  new 

principle is proposed, which applies the resonance phenomenon in 2D PhCs [2]. This 

resonance phenomenon in one 2D PhCs leads to narrow band filtering in reflection [3]. 

And the resonating frequency is very sensitive to the incidental angle and polarization 

of  the  incidental  light  with  proper  design.  When  two  PhCs  are  overlaid  the 

transmission or reflection spectra can be used to do tilt, rotation alignment and even 

translation alignment if these two PhCs are close enough to each other. 

The rest of this paper is organized as following: in section 2 the basic principle of this 

method is presented and the alignment accuracy is analyzed, the experimental results 

are presented in section 3, finally conclusion is given in section 4. 

 

 

2. Theory 

The  principle  of  this  new  method  is  based  on  the  resonance  phenomenon  in  planar 

periodic structures caused by coupling between incidental light and guided modes in 

the  structures  [].  For  simplicity  only  1D  structures  are  considered  here.  Figure  1 

shows  the  structure  of  1D  PhC  slabs.  A  silicon  nitride  layer  are  deposited  on  glass 

substrate and a lay of PhC slab is fabricated on the top by nanoimprint lithography. If 

the  top  PhC  is  much  thinner  than  the  wavelength  of  incidental  light,  the  reflection 

spectra of this kind of resonant periodic structures around the resonating wavelength 

can be approximated by Lorentzian lineshape expressed as []:

incidental  light.  m  is an  integer. 

rβ  and 

iβ are respectively real part and  image part 

of the propagating constant of guided wave in the slab waveguide formed by the SiNx 

layer (the image part is introduced by the top grating). So the resonating condition is 

the quasi momentum conservation along the grating plane. For 1D PhCs two kinds of 

incidental  angles  are  considered,  one  is  defined  as  tilt  angle  (Fig.1a)  and  another  is 

defined as yaw (Fig.1b). 

The resonating conditions for these two situations are given by

 is  the  wavevector  of  incidental  light  in  free  space,  and  for  subwavelength 

cases m always equals one. From equation (3) it is easy to be seen that if tilt angle is 

not  zero  coupling  conditions  for  the  incidental  light  to  the  guided  wave  in  two 

directions  are  different.  This  causes  two  minimum  transmission  wavelengths  in 

spectrum.  The  yaw  angle  causes  blue  shift  of  minimum  transmission  position 

according  to  equation  (4).  The  effects  of  tilt  angle  on  minimum  transmission  splits 

and  effects  of  yaw  angle  on  minimum  transmission  shift  can  be  calculated 

numerically with rigorous coupled-wave analysis (RCWA) []. In the proposed novel 

alignment method the splits and blue shift of the minimum transmissions can be used 

to adjust the parallelity of the two overlaid PhCs. 

 

If the two overlaid PhCs are face-to-face and parallel to each other and the gratings 

are  also  parallel  to  each  other,  as  shown  in  principle  scheme  (Fig.2),  translation 

between  of  the  two  PhCs  along  the  direction perpendicular  to  the  grating  can  affect 

the transmission spectrum. When the gap between the two PhCs is small enough, the 

waveguided  modes  of  the  two  PhCs  are  coupled  with  each  other.  And  the 

transmission spectrum of the photonic crystal stack is sensitive to the translation shift 

between them. The numerical investigation results of the effects of translational shift 

are shown in Fig.3. In simulation UV curable resist is assumed to fill the gap between 

the  two  PhCs,  which  is  most  of  cases  in  alignment  processes.  From  the  simulation 

results it can be seen that the spectrum for zero shift between two PhCs and that for 

reverse  phase  shift  (half  pitch  shift)  has single  minimum  transmission  in  considered 

wavelength  range,  other  values  of  shift  cause  double  minima  of  transmission.  This 

phenomenon can be explained by zero-pole theory of gratings. The overlaid two PhCs 

can  be  viewed  as  a  system  with  two  poles  and  one  zero,  and  the  transmission 

spectrum of this system can be expressed in such a formation

translation  shift  between  the  two  overlaid  PhCs.  And  it  can  be  proved  that  the  zero 

coincides with one of the two poles when the translation shift between the two PhCs 

is 0 or half pitch (this will be presented in another work). That means for these two 

kinds of shift the whole structure is a one-pole system and has only one transmission 

minimum  in  certain  range.  The  accuracy  of  the  translational  alignment  with  this 

method depends on the resolution of the spectrometer used. For the structure used in 

the simulation, the translational alignment accuracy can be estimated as 20nm when 

spectrometer with 0.01nm resolution is used. 

Because the coupling resonance between incidental light and guided modes in PhCs 

depends  on  the  polarization  of  the  incidental  light,  special  2D  photonic  crystal 

structures may be applied to do rotation alignment (azimuthal alignment, considering 

the direction of incidental light as axis). That would not be discussed in this paper. 

In  principle  transmission  spectrum  or  reflection  spectrum  of  two  overlaid  special 

PhCs  (with  in-plane  waveguiding  ability)  can  be  used  to  do  tilt,  translation  and 

rotation  alignment.  Next  section  preliminary  experiments  are  presented  and  the 

alignment accuracy is discussed. 

3. Experiments and discussions 

 

 

 

 

The  scheme  of  the  experimental  setup  is  shown  in  Fig.4.  The  light  source  is  a  light 

emission  diode  (LED)  with  central  wavelength  of  1537nm  and  full  width  of  half 

maximum (FWHM) of 49.4nm. The light is coupled out with a collimator from fiber 

to free space and goes through a polarizer to be linearly polarized. This light then goes 

through two samples of photonic crystals held by stages that can adjust the tilt angle 

and yaw angle of samples. The transmitted light is collected by another collimator and 

sent to optical spectrum analyzer. The PhC samples used in experiment are 1 um 1D 

gratings. The structure of these samples is similar as that shown in Fig.3(c), but the 

parameters are different. In these samples the silicon nitride layer under the grating is 

350 nm thick and the grating depth is 49 nm. 

The results of experiments of tilt and yaw alignments are show in Fig.5. Because the 

two  PhC  samples  are  assumed  to  be  the  same  in  structure,  when  they  are  exactly 

parallel to each other and the light normally incidents the transmission spectrum has 

just one minimum and with a narrow linewidth. If there is a tilt angle between these 

two samples one of these samples is not perpendicular to the incidental light beam any 

more and there are three minima of transmission in the spectrum (as shown in Fig.5 

(a)). The outer two minima of transmission are caused by the splitting of transmission 

minimum of the tilted sample. The splitting between two outer minima was measured 

under different tilt angle and the result is shown in Fig.5 (b). The result shows that the 

variation  of  transmission  spectrum  is  very  sensitive  to  the  tilt  angle.  The  data  was 

fitted by a linear function showing that 0.03 degree tilt angle causes 1 nm split of the 

transmission minima. Then with sub-angstrom spectrometer the accuracy of tilt angle 

alignment can reach the order of 0.001 degree. 

The variation of spectrum versus yaw angle (defined in Fig.1(b)) was also measured. 

The results are shown in Fig.6. From equation (4) it can be seen that yaw angle causes 

blueshift of minimum in transmission spectrum of the yawed sample. The results of 

measurement confirmed this as shown in Fig.6(a). The blueshift versus yaw angle is 

shown in Fig.6(b). The effect of yaw angle on transmission spectrum is much smaller 

than  that  of  tilt  angle.  Measurement  data  show  that  0.5  degree  yaw  angle  can  only 

cause 1 nm blueshift of transmission minimum. 

 

The much higher sensitivity of transmission to tilt angle than to yaw angle suggests 

that 2D photonic crystal structure is more suitable in this application, because for 2D 

PhCs the effects of tilt and yaw on the transmission spectra both can be describe by 

equation  (3)  then  lead  to  high  alignment  accuracy.  Proper  choose  of  material  and 

parameters  of  the  structure  can  improve  the  alignment  accuracy  further.  From 

equation  (3)  it  can  be  seen  that  the  smaller  the  chromatic  dispersion  the  higher  the 

sensitivity of transmission spectrum to the incidental angle. So waveguiding structure 

with low waveguiding chromatic dispersion is preferred in this alignment application. 

The relationship between the split of transmission minima and small tilt angle can be 

expressed as

It  is  easy  to  be  drawn  out  that  thick  slab  waveguides  have  small  waveguiding 

chromatic dispersion. Several things should be considered in designing the structure, 

not  only  small  chromatic  dispersion  is  pursued,  but  also  the  position  of  minimum 

transmission  and  linewidth  of  the  transmission  valley  should  be  considered.  The 

position  of  the  minima  needs  to  be  in  the  spetrum  range  of  light  source,  and  the 

linewidth cannot be too small to be resolved by optical spectrum analyzers.  

4. Conclusions 

A  novel  optical  method  for  overlay  alignment  using  two  PhCs  is  proposed  in  this 

work. The mechanism of this method is based on the coupling between the incidental 

light  and  the  in-plane  guided  wave  of  the  PhCs  through  the  periodic  structure.  This 

coupling  leads  to  resonance  for  some  certain  wavelengths  and  then  minima 

transmission  in  spectra.  Theoretical  and  experimental  investigations  show  that  the 

transmission spectra are sensitive to the incidental angle the polarization of light and 

relative translation between the two overlaid PhCs. With this method, tilt, rotation and 

translation  alignments  can be  achieved. The accuracy of alignments mainly  depends 

on the structure of PhCs and the resolution of the optical spectrum analyzer used to 

detect the transmitted light. 

This new method is very useful for nanoimprint lithography (NIL) and using NIL to 

build  photonic  crystal  stacks  and  it’s  also  a  new  method  of  postural  controlling  for 

other applications.

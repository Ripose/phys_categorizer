We  report  on  phenomenon  of  Anderson-type  localization  of  walking  solitons  in  optical 

lattices  with  random  frequency  modulation,  manifested  as  dramatic  enhancement  of 

soliton  trapping  probability  on  lattice  inhomogeneities  with  growth  of  the  frequency 

fluctuation level. The localization process is strongly sensitive to the lattice depth since 

in  shallow  lattices  walking  solitons  experience  random  refraction  and/or  multiple 

scattering in contrast to relatively deep lattices, where solitons are typically immobilized 

in the vicinity of local minimums on modulation frequency.

The  concept  of  Anderson  localization  was  introduced  in  the  field  of  solid-state 

physics for the phenomenon of disorder-induced metal-insulator transition in electronic 

systems. Anderson localization refers to the situation where electron, when released in a 

random  medium,  may  stay  close  to  the  initial  point  [1].  The  mechanism  behind  this 

property  has  been  attributed  to  multiple  scattering  of  electrons  by  the  random 

potentials,  a  feature  of  the  wave  nature  of  electrons.  The  localization  concept  may  be 

applied to the classical linear wave systems as well [2]. However the challenging problem 

is  the  exploration  of  the  nonlinear  analogs  of  Anderson  localization.  The  interplay 

between disorder and nonlinearity was recently studied in the systems described by one-

dimensional  nonlinear  Schrödinger  equation  with  random-point  impurities  [3,4],  in 

discrete  waveguide  arrays  [5,6],  and  in  globular  protein  [7].  Recently,  the  concept  of

nonlinear  optical  lattices  has  attracted  steady  attention  in  both  nonlinear  optics  and 

matter  waves  fields.  It  was  demonstrated  that  periodic  lattices  are  capable  to  support 

stable solitons, whose properties can be tuned continuously from that typical for solitons 

in uniform nonlinear medium to those representative for solitons in discrete systems by 

changing strength of the optical lattice [8-11]. The tunability of optical lattice proved to 

be very promising for soliton management, including radiative switching and parametric 

steering [12-15]. It is worth noticing that mathematically analogous problems appear in 

the theory of Bose-Einstein condensates [16-18]. However, up to date theoretical studies 

of  soliton  propagation  in  optical  lattices  were  restricted  mainly  to  the  case  of  regular, 

perfectly periodic lattices. 

In  this  paper  we  demonstrate  the  existence  of  nonlinear  analog  of  Anderson 

localization  for  walking  solitons  in  optical  lattices  with  random  frequency  modulation. 

We  show  that  with  growth  of  frequency  fluctuations  the  multiple-scattering  scenario 

gradually replaces the random-refraction one and finally probability of soliton trapping 

grows dramatically. In terms of solid-state physics this might be interpreted as smooth 

phase  transition  between  soliton  conductor  and  soliton  insulator.  Disorder-induced 

soliton localization depends strongly on the depth of the lattice and can be tuned. 

The generic equation describing the evolution of optical (matter) wave packets in 

the presence of Kerr (mean field cubic) nonlinearity and a periodic potential induced by 

a weak optical lattice is the nonlinear Schrödinger equation:

In  the  optical  context  q   is  the  dimensionless  amplitude  of  light  field;  the  longitudinal

 are scaled to the diffraction length and the input beam 

width,  respectively.  The  waveguiding  parameter  p   is  proportional  to  the  depth  of 

refractive index modulation, while the random function  R  stands for the transverse 

( )η

profile of refractive index. We assume that the depth of refractive index modulation is 

small compared to the unperturbed index and is of the order of nonlinear contribution 

to refractive index due to Kerr effect. In the particular case of optical lattice induction

uniform background illumination nonlinearity saturation intrinsic for the photorefractive 

medium can be reduced substantially, and under this conditions Eq. (1) can be readily 

applied to study general soliton properties. 

In  the  matter  waves  context  Eq.  (1)  describes  dynamics  of  a  one-dimensional 

Bose-Einstein condensate confined in an optical lattice generated by means of a standing

the rate of distortion decreases dramatically with growth of the correlation length.

this equation can be applied to FM lattice as well, if one replaces carrying frequency

when soliton crosses lattice channels, can be neglected if the instantaneous propagation

with  growth  of  lattice  depth  (up  to 

p ∼

)  some  of  lattice  inhomogeneities  become 

strong  enough  to  cause  single  or  multiple  acts  of  scattering  (Fig.  1(a)).  The  physics 

behind  this  process  differs  substantially  from  well-studied  case  of  scattering  by  point 

defects [19]. Thus, we found empirically that scattering occurs in the region with almost 

linear  modulation  of  instantaneous  frequency  where  R

All  spectral  soliton  components  belonging  to  this  band  will  be  reflected  synchronously

  and  soliton  will  retain  its  shape  upon  scattering.  Notice  that  the  distance

lattice  fragments  increases  with

optical pulse reflection by linearly chirped Bragg-grating. 

With further growth of the lattice depth the scenario of random soliton trapping 

becomes  dominant  (Fig.  1(b)).  For  the  relatively  deep  lattices  with 

p ≥

  soliton  is 

usually  immobilized  in  a  close  proximity  of  launching  point,  while  typical  transverse 

displacement  is  of  the  order  of  correlation  length.  Soliton  is  typically  trapped  in  the

.  Physically,  this  means  that  in  the  area  of 

instantaneous  frequency  minimum  the  Bragg-type  guiding  channel  is  formed  where 

soliton  can  be  captured.  The  probability  of  soliton  trapping  then  greatly  increases  as 

p

→

crp

. Notice, that mixed localization scenarios (i.e. soliton scattering followed by its 

trapping) are also possible. 

Figures  2(a)  and  2(b)  show  histograms  of  the  path-averaged  soliton  center 

displacement and its squared deviation. Such histograms provide us with the number of 

lattice  profile  realizations  N

  fall  into  fixed  intervals.  On  the  basis  of  Figs  2(a)  and  2(b)  one  can  draw  the 

av

conclusion about key features of the probability density functions of 

av
 and  S . For 
k

instance, the histogram of

av

η

probable  value  of  path-averaged  soliton  center  displacement,  and  its  width  gives  the 

information  about  the  localization  area.  The  S

  histogram  provides  information 

av
0/k
S

about the fraction of trajectories that differ remarkably from linear ones. 

The impact of lattice depth on statistically averaged soliton center displacement 

 and its squared deviation 

S

 is illustrated in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b). Both  η  and 

 decrease monotonically with growth of the waveguiding parameter, but the slope of 

both dependencies drops off remarkably in the vicinity of  p

≈

0.25

. Careful analysis of 

propagation  dynamics  shows  that  it  is  around  this  value  of  p   the  multiple-scattering 

scenario  is  gradually  replaced  with  the  trapping  one.  Therefore  increase  in  the  lattice 

depth  leads  to  the  qualitative  modification  of  stochastic  soliton  dynamics.  Notice  that 

the  variance  of 

η

  also  reaches  its  maximum  value  in  the  vicinity  of  the  point 

p ≈

0.25

 where qualitative change of propagation dynamics occurs. 

Figures  3(c)  and  3(d)  show  dependencies  of 

η

  and 

S

  on  the  standard 

deviation  of  frequency  fluctuations.  Besides  the  soliton  localization  enhancement  with 

η

S

 

6

growth of the disorder level, one should point out negligible localization probability at 

low  fluctuation  levels  (for  σ

10−≤

2

  at 

p =

1

).  With  increase  of  the  disorder  level 

beyond  this  critical  value  the  localization  probability  growths  dramatically,  and 

random-refraction  scenario  is  rapidly  replaced  with  the  multiple-scattering  one.  In  the 

strong  disorder  limit  (

0σΩ

1)>

  the  width  of  localization  area  saturates  at  the  level  of 

few  correlation  lengths  and  the  center  of  this  area  is  displaced  in  the  direction  of 

launching point. The phenomenon of the rapid growth of soliton localization probability 

in  nonlinear  optical  lattices  with  increase  of  disorder  level  that  we  uncover  here  is 

reminiscent  to  phenomenon  of  Anderson  localization  in  linear  wave  systems  [2],  and 

might  be  interpreted  as  smooth  phase  transition  between  soliton-  conducting  and 

soliton-insulating  lattice  states.  Finally,  to  stress  qualitative  changes  in  the  soliton 

behavior with growth of the lattice depth and disorder level, we have plotted derivatives

 (Fig. 4(b)). 

To conclude, we have exposed the phenomenon of Anderson-type localization of 

walking  spatial  solitons  in  optical  lattices  with  the  random  frequency  modulation  and 

encountered  dramatic  suppression  of  localization  effect  at  low  fluctuation  levels.  We 

showed  that  the  localization  process  is  strongly  sensitive  to  the  lattice  depth  since  in 

shallow  lattices  moving  solitons  experience  random  refraction  or/and  scattering  on  the 

lattice inhomogeneities in contrast to deep lattices, where solitons are typically trapped. 

The estimates for parameter range where these propagation scenarios occur are given.

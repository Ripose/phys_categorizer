ABSTRACT

The main purposes of this paper are (i) to illustrate explicitly by a number of examples the gauge
functions      ( x ,t ) whose spatial and temporal derivatives transform one set of electromagnetic
potentials into another equivalent set; and (ii) to show that, whatever propagation or non-
propagation characteristics are exhibited by the potentials in a particular gauge, the electric and
magnetic fields are always the same and display the experimentally verified properties of
causality and propagation at the speed of light. The example of the transformation from the
Lorenz gauge (retarded solutions for both scalar and vector potential) to the Coulomb gauge
(instantaneous, action-at-a-distance, scalar potential) is treated in detail.  A new and transparent
expression is obtained for the vector potential in the Coulomb gauge, with a finite nonlocality in
time replacing the expected spatial nonlocality of the transverse current. A new class of gauges
(v-gauge) is described in which the scalar potential propagates at an arbitrary speed v relative to
the speed of light. The Lorenz and Coulomb gauges are special cases of the v-gauge. The last
examples of gauges and explicit gauge transformation functions are the Hamiltonian or temporal
gauge, the nonrelativistic Poincaré or multipolar gauge, and the relativistic Fock-Schwinger gauge.

I.  INTRODUCTION

The use of potentials in electromagnetism has a long history.  The long path to an

understanding that the vector and scalar potentials are not unique and that different potentials
describing the same physics are connected by something called a gauge transformation has been
1
described by Okun and me elsewhere.
scalar potential      ( x,t ) and a vector potential     A( x ,t ), the physically meaningful and unique
electric and magnetic fields     E( x,t ) and     B( x,t ) are determined from the potentials according to

Here we are using Gaussian units and considering phenomena in vacuum or as microscopic fields
with localized sources. The expressions (1.1) are constituted so that they satisfy the

homogeneous Maxwell equations automatically.   Since the gradient of a scalar function has zero
curl, it is clear that the magnetic field is unchanged if we add to A the gradient of a scalar function.
Of course, such an addition changes the expression for the electric field. We must therefore
modify the scalar potential, too.  These changes are called a gauge transformation. Specifically,
we have new potentials,      '( x ,t ) and     A'( x,t ) ,

A'( x,t ) = A( x ,t ) + (cid:209)

where the scalar function      ( x ,t )  is called the gauge function.  The potentials     A'( x,t ) ,      '( x ,t )
are fully equivalent to the original set     A( x ,t ),      ( x,t ), yielding the same electric and magnetic
fields, but satisfying different dynamical equations. The chief purposes of this paper are to
demonstrate some gauge transformations explicitly and to show explicitly that potentials in those
different gauges, though different in detail, always yield the same electric and magnetic fields.

 that transforms one gauge into another.

In Section II we review the form of the equations and the solutions for the potentials in

the Lorenz gauge. We also exhibit the corresponding equations in the Coulomb gauge, focusing on
the nonlocality of the source for the vector potential. The direct solution is deferred to Section
IV.  In Section III the gauge function      ( x ,t ) to go from the Lorenz gauge to the Coulomb gauge
is constructed and used to calculate the Coulomb-gauge vector potential. The novel results (3.10)
and (3.16) or (3.17), are surprisingly explicit and compact, with only one time integral over a
finite range of the source’s time t’  (t - R/c < t’ < t), replacing the spatial nonlocality of the source
with a temporal nonlocality.  We return to the original equation for the Coulomb-gauge vector
potential in Section IV and show that its straightforward solution can be transformed into that
obtained in Section III more directly and simply through the gauge function.

In Section V we derive the electric and magnetic fields from the Coulomb-gauge potentials
and show that they are the well known expressions, causal and propagating with speed c, despite
the instantaneous nature of the scalar potential. This ground has been traveled before in this

journal by Brill and Goodman

The Hamiltonian or temporal gauge, with its vanishing scalar potential, is treated in

Section VIII, while Section IX describes the nonrelativistic and relativistic gauges that go under
the names of Poincaré, multipolar, Fock, or Schwinger. The gauge functions are exhibited as well
as the potentials. For the nonrelativistic case the interaction Lagrangian in the multipolar gauge is
described.  Finally, a summary is given in Section X.  An appendix presents the Lorenz-to-
Coulomb gauge function in terms of the current density rather than the charge density and finds
its quasi-static limit.

Traditionally, the solutions for the potentials are presented first in the Lorenz gauge.

One generally begins with the relations (1.1) substituted into the inhomogeneous Maxwell
equations to give two coupled partial differential equations,

An alternative is to choose the second relation in (2.3),     

(cid:215) A = 0. This choice, called the

Coulomb or radiation or transverse gauge, makes the equation for the scalar potential simple,

The effective current on the right hand side is known as the transverse current.  It has zero

can write the total current to show explicitly the two parts:

Since the source terms are nonlocal in space, the retarded solutions ostensibly involve two 3-
dimensional spatial integrals. In the next section, we find the gauge function 
 that takes us from
the Lorenz gauge to the Coulomb gauge. We show that in fact the solution in the Coulomb gauge
needs only one 3-dimensional spatial integration plus a time integration over a finite interval
(nonlocality in time).  That the two forms of the solution are equivalent is demonstrated in
Section IV.

we note the closeness of (3.8) to the equation (2.10) for the auxiliary function

 Characteristically (3.6) contains values of the charge density at all times from the

B.  Vector potential in Coulomb gauge

Since we know the scalar potential in the Coulomb gauge (3.2) all that remains is to add
the gradient of (3.6) to the vector potential from (2.5) to find the vector potential in this gauge.
The gradient of (3.6) is

Here we have utilized the abbreviation “ret” to indicate that the quantity inside the square
brackets is to be evaluated at the retarded time t’ = t - R/c. The first part of the vector potential is
a standard retarded form. The additional time integral over all times t’ from t’ = t - R/c to t’ = t  is
the price we pay for having the simple instantaneous scalar potential. The price is, however,
lower than appeared initially from the spatial nonlocality of the sources.  We show in Section V
how the fields calculated from the potentials in the Coulomb gauge are the same as those found
from the Lorenz gauge (and any other gauge). fully obeying causality and a finite speed of
propagation.

An alternative expression for the Coulomb-gauge vector potential, totally in terms of the

current density, can be obtained as follows. The two terms in (3.9) can be combined by an
integration by parts:

The first line is the contribution from the retarded and locally transverse current. It is the only
term that survives in the radiation zone of a localized source. The second line, with its more rapid

Here R’ = x - x’’, while R’’ = x’’ - x’ and “ret” means t’ = t - R’/c (NOT t’ = t - R’’/c). The
somewhat peculiar choice of primes is with malice aforethought. Our plan of action is to find 
as an integral over three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, as in (3.17) for example, then
take its gradient as in (2.9) to find the longitudinal vector potential, and subtract that from the
Lorenz-gauge vector potential (2.5) to find the transverse (Coulomb-gauge) vector potential.
We proceed by interchanging the orders of integration in (4.1), We need the familiar

coordinate R = x - x’ = R’ + R’’. Then we have R’’ = |R - R’| .  As we interchange the orders of

V.  ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS FROM THE COULOMB-GAUGE 

POTENTIALS

A.  Fields obtained from the Coulomb-gauge potentials

It seems necessary from time to time to show that the electric and magnetic fields are

independent of the choice of gauge for the potentials. In particular, the Coulomb gauge, with its
instantaneous scalar potential, seems to contradict the ingrained truth that all electromagnetic
fields in vacuum propagate with the speed of light. In this section we focus on that troublesome
gauge, taking as our starting point the potentials (3.2) and (3.9),

The first three terms here are retarded contributions to the electric field. The last term is an
instantaneous contribution. A moment’s thought shows that it is the positive gradient of the
scalar potential in (5.1). This piece is the part of the Coulomb-gauge vector potential that cancels
the instantaneous piece of the electric field from the scalar potential. The net result for the
electric field is

The terms in  AC (5.1) involving the charge density are proportional to     ˆ R times scalar functions
and so have zero curl and do not contribute to B.

11

Equations (5.2) and (5.3) are the “Jefimenko” expressions for the electromagnetic
fields.
 They are normally evaluated from the Lorenz-gauge potentials, but we see that the
Coulomb-gauge potentials serve just as well. And any other gauge, too.  They only involve
retarded expressions despite the presence of other terms in the potentials. Given the completely
general results in the Introduction about gauge transformations and different gauges being
equivalent, it could hardly be otherwise.  Nonetheless it is satisfying to see explicitly how it
comes about.

B.  Harmonic time dependence

Another instructive way to see how the Coulomb-gauge potentials conspire to produce
properly retarded fields is to consider harmonic time dependence. Then the integral over time in
t .  Then
(5.1) can be done explicitly.  We assume       ( x,t ) = ( x )e

VI.  QUASI-STATIC LIMIT OF THE COULOMB-GAUGE VECTOR POTENTIAL AND 

THE DARWIN LAGRANGIAN

A. The quasi-static vector potential in Coulomb gauge

The  quasi-static  limit  is  defined  as  the  neglect  of  retardation.  For  the  Lorenz  gauge
potentials (2.5) the structure is unchanged, one merely replaces the retarded source terms by their
values at the present (observer’s) time t. In the Coulomb gauge, the scalar potential is already
“quasi-static,” i.e., instantaneous. For the vector potential (3.16) or (3.17) we merely  replace the

B.  Heaviside-Darwin Lagrangian

In the Coulomb gauge the exact scalar potential is the instantaneous Coulomb potential.
The Coulomb gauge is therefore very convenient in the treatment of interacting charged particles
by Lagrangian methods where all particles have a common time. To include velocity dependent
2
effects, the vector potentials of the moving charges must enter.  To the inclusive order of 1/c
effects, however, one can neglect retardation because the      v(cid:215) A / c  terms in the Lagrangian  are
2
; retardation corrections contribute only to higher order in 1/c.  The vector
already of order 1/c
potential (6.1) can be used.

Consider the interaction of two point charged particles with charges   q, q' and coordinates
and velocities x, v, and     x', v' . Let     r = x - x'  and     r = |x - x'| . Then the vector potential caused by
charge   q' , evaluated at the position of charge q is

The vector potential of charge q evaluated at the position of    q'  has the same form, with the
interchange of primed and unprimed quantities. The scalar products of these vector potentials
with the other particle’s velocity times charge are evidently the same and one half their sum is
equal  to  one  term.  Together  with  the  instantaneous  Coulomb  interaction,  the  interaction
2
Lagrangian, correct to order 1/c

 inclusive, is thus

This interaction Lagrangian is called the Darwin Lagrangian, after C. G. Darwin who derived it in
, although it was derived in effect by
1920 by expansion of the Liênard-Wiechert potentials
14

 It has uses in plasma physics and in quantum mechanics (as the

basis for the so-called Breit interaction of two electrons in atoms).

13

If higher order terms beyond (6.3) are desired, one may expand the current densities in
(3.16) in Taylor series around t’ =  t.  These terms will contain the particles’ accelerations and
higher  derivatives  with  respect  to  time.    To  get  a  conventional  Lagrangian  it  will  then  be
necessary to use lower order equations of motion to eliminate terms beyond the velocities.

VII.  GAUGE FUNCTION AND POTENTIALS FOR THE “VELOCITY” GAUGE

 
The Lorenz gauge and the Coulomb gauge are in some sense the extremes in behavior of
the scalar potential. In the one the effects of a source point propagate with the speed c; in the
other the propagation is at infinite speed.  But there is no reason for a restriction to such limiting
cases. We define the “velocity” gauge ( v-gauge for short) to be one in which the speed of
propagation for the scalar potential is v, an arbitrary speed relative to c. The gauge condition for
such a gauge generalizes those of (2.3), namely,

The scalar potential in the v-gauge is

This means that the time derivative of the gauge function to go from the Lorenz gauge to the v-

We see that the second line in (7.10), an expression with retardation at the arbitrary speed v, just
cancels the similarly retarded contribution from the scalar potential (7.9), leaving the electric field
E equal to the normally retarded result, (5.2).  The magnetic field B (5.3) follows directly from
(7.8) with only the current density term contributing to the curl.  We emphasize that the fields
are causal at speed c despite the arbitrary propagation behavior of the v-gauge potentials (and
true whether v > c or v < c).

D.  Quasi-static limit of the v-gauge vector potential

In the quasi-static limit retardation is neglected. The time integration in (7.7) can be done.

gauges. The Coulomb-gauge result (6.1) comes from   
of retardation the scalar potential (7.2) is independent of v and is just the Coulomb-gauge scalar
potential for all v.

Because (7.1) and (7.11), as well as the gauge function (A.5’), were obtained in 1870 for

quasi-static fields by Helmholtz, we should perhaps rechristen the v-gauge as the Helmholtz
gauge or class of gauges.

E.  Technical remark

There is a technical point here. Our development of the v-gauge potentials is based on an

arbitrary speed of propagation for the scalar potential, either slower or faster than the speed of

Weber’s vector potential requires

the quasi-static limit. But detailed consideration of this regime, with its exponentially growing or
decaying instead of propagating solutions, would take us too far afield to pursue further here.

VIII.  HAMILTONIAN OR TEMPORAL GAUGE

The Hamiltonian or temporal gauge is one in which the scalar potential is identically zero.

To obtain a result involving less of the charge density and more of the current density, we
can proceed just as  we  did  in  going  from  (3.9)  to  (3.11).  An  integration  by  parts  in  (8.4)
transforms it into

Use of the continuity equation for charge and current as done in going from (3.11) to (3.16) - only
the limits of integration are different - and the addition of the Lorenz-gauge vector potential leads
to an alternative expression for the temporal-gauge vector potential,

This form of the vector potential is closely similar to the Coulomb-gauge result (3.16).  The
absence of the scalar potential in this gauge is compensated for  by the explicit time dependence
on (t-t0).  Note that for electrostatics, with its vanishing current density and its time-independent
charge density, it is the second integral with its coefficient -c(t-t0) that gives the electrostatic
electric field.

IX.  POINCARÉ-MULTIPOLAR-FOCK-SCHWINGER GAUGE

15, 16

A  choice  of  gauge  that  goes  by  the  names  Poincaré  gauge,  multipolar  gauge,  Fock-
Schwinger gauge (and other  names,  too)  finds  use  for  atoms  and  molecules  interacting  with
external electromagnetic fields
 Actually, there are
two closely related gauges, one constraining the vector potential according to      x(cid:215) A = 0, usually
associated with the name multipolar or Poincaré gauge, and the other  its  relativistic  4-vector
x A = 0 , usually but not always called the Fock-Schwinger or sometimes the
    
Poincaré gauge.

The sum of (9.13) and (9.14) give

bears some semblance to the gauge functions discussed in sections III and VII. There we obtained
either a “charge density” expression or a “current density” form. Here the mixture of both types
occurs because the multipolar gauge has both Lorenz-gauge potentials transformed into inherently
different structures.

B.  Charged-particle interaction Lagrangian with multipolar gauge

The multipolar gauge or its equivalent is used in quantum mechanical treatments of the
interaction of atoms and molecular with external or radiation fields in what amounts to the dipole
approximation (or occasionally higher multipoles). We begin classically and consider a number of
charged particles in motion in interaction with external electromagnetic fields. For simplicity of
notation, let the particles be described formally by continuous charge and current densities,

peculiar propagation characteristics of the potentials, the electric and magnetic fields derived from
them are the same for all choices of gauge.

The choice of gauge is a matter of convenience.  The basic connections (1.1) of the fields
to the potentials guarantee that  the  fields  are  unchanged  by  a  change  of  gauge  (1.2)  of  the
potentials.  One  might  argue  that  this  paper  is  an  empty  exercise  with  obvious  foregone
conclusions. Yet enough confusion and error continue to appear in the literature that it seems
useful to explicate at length with concrete examples. It is also useful, I think, to exhibit the actual
gauge functions 

, a thing rarely if ever done in textbooks.

Two novel features are claimed: (i) the relatively simple forms of the vector potential in
the Coulomb  and  v-gauges,  with  the  only  added  complication  (relative  to  the  Lorenz-gauge
retarded solutions) of a temporal nonlocality over a finite time interval; and (ii) the introduction
of the v-gauge with its scalar potential propagating at an arbitrary speed v relative to  c. In the
quasi-static limit the v-gauges  are  equivalent  to  a  class  of  gauges  introduced  (without  these
words) by Helmholtz in 1870.

We  have  chosen  the  irrelevant  constant  c
0  =  Q    to  clear  (A.4)  of  unnecessary  quantities.
Equation (A.4) is the “current” representation of the gauge function, completely equivalent to the
“charge” form, (3.6).

(b)  Helmholtz’s quasi-static gauge function

In 1870 Helmholtz discussed the equivalence of certain  different  forms  of  the  vector
 and exhibited the scalar function that interpolated between the Neumann form of A
potential
(now known to be the quasi-static limit of  A in  the  Lorenz  gauge)  to  the  Weber  form  (the

12

(cid:215) A - 1
corresponding limit of A in a gauge where 
c
      

= 0 ).

t

The quasi-static limit occurs when the source and observation point are such the  R is
bounded by some limit Rmax and the fractional change of the current in a time interval Rmax/c is
negligible.  Then the change in the current density during the time integration in (A.4) can be
neglected.  The current density can be replaced by its present value J(x, t) The time integral is

(c)  Alternative route to Helmholtz’s quasi-static gauge function

The result (A.5) can be obtained directly from approximating (3.6), but using slightly
more care. It  is  not  sufficient  to  say  that  the  charge  density  is  unchanged  during  the  time
.  The charge density must be expanded in a Taylor series in
integration - that yields a constant 
time:

Integration over d   of the first term in the square bracket results in -Q, canceling the constant
according to our choice above. Integration over d   (not t) and use of the charge-current continuity
equation on the second term yields

qs = - 1

Now integration by parts casts the gradient operator over onto R, with

  I believe there is an error in sign in Skagerstam
He too leaves the verification to the reader.

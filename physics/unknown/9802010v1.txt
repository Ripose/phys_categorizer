A Perturbative Approach to the
Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator

J. Guerrero1,2 and V. Aldaya1,3

January 29, 1998

Abstract

A quantum realization of the Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator is realized in terms
of the spatial variable x and d
dx (the minimal canonical representation). The
eigenstates of the Hamiltonian operator are found (at lower order) by using
1. Unlike the Foldy-Wouthuysen
a perturbation expansion in the constant c−
transformed version of the relativistic hydrogen atom, conventional perturba-
tion theory cannot be applied and a perturbation of the scalar product itself is
required.

1 Introduction

The Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator is probably the simplest relativistic system contain-
ing bound states, yet it exhibits the typical problems of Relativistic Quantum Mechanics.
Many papers have been devoted to the solution of this relativistc system [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
although the ﬁrst question is probably to deﬁne what we understand by a Relativistic
Harmonic Oscillator.

In a previous paper [6], we adopted an algebraic method for both deﬁning and solving

such an oscillator equation which started with the Lie operator algebra

limit, i.e. the one leading to the Harmonic Oscillator. The solution was given
through a manifestly covariant representation of the corresponding group (i.e. the wave
functions are solutions of a Klein-Gordon-like equation). The energy eigenfunctions in
conﬁguration space consist of a general weight function (the vacuum) which converges to
a Gaussian in the limit c
, a speciﬁc power of the vacuum (reﬂecting the explicit
dependence on time of the manifestly covariant representation) which reduces to unity in
iEnt) and a polynomial leading
this limit, the usual time-dependent phase factor exp(
to the corresponding non-relativistic Hermite polynomial as c
. As a consequence
of the explicit dependence on time, the scalar product was deﬁned by using the invariant
measure dxdt. These representations correspond to a realization in the real variables (x, t)
mc2
of the Discrete series D+(k) of the SL(2, R) group [8, 9] for Bargmann index k = N
¯hω .
In this paper we study the problem appearing in the conﬁguration-space representa-
tion when the time dependence is factorized out in the search for a minimal, canonical
realization (given in terms of only x and d
dx ) in a way similar to that of the relativistic
hydrogen atom. In this last case, a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation leads to a Hamil-
tonian containing higher-order relativistic corrections to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian
1 of
[10]. Ordinary perturbation theory provides the energy levels as a power series in c−
the exact values already obtained from the manifestly covariant (Dirac) equation.

In the present case, however, the situation is quite diﬀerent because the terms in
the Hamiltonian that are considered here as higher-order relativistic corrections to the
non-relativistic Hamiltonian are not Hermitian with respect to the non-relativistic scalar
product (with measure dx) and a perturbation of the scalar product itself is required.
These higher-order relativistic corrections should be understood as a power expansion in
1/k of the representations of the Discrete series for large Bargmann indices k = N = mc2
¯hω .
Our group quantization method [11] essentially consists in exponentiating the abstract
algebra (either Poisson or operator algebra) of basic quantities deﬁning a given physical
system, usually a u(1)-centrally extended algebra ˜
, and considering in the resulting group
G
G) the two mutually commuting sets of vectors ﬁelds, χR(

the left and right action of the group on itself. One set of vector ﬁelds will constitute
the operators of the theory, while the other can be used to fully reduce the action of
the former. To be a bit more precise, we consider the subspace of complex functions on
G), that satisfy the U(1)-equivariance condition, ΞΨ = iΨ, where Ξ is the central

polarization in [14], are given. A reduction to a minimal representation (in terms of x
and d
dx ) is tempted through a naive elimination of the time variable and the substitution
i¯h ∂
mc2, but this leads to a theory which is not unitary. The solution is achieved
by modifying the scalar product and the operators in a consistent though not quite well
understood way. In section 3 a perturbative approach to the problem of the reduction is
proposed. From an exact inﬁnite-order polarization (which represents the “square root”
of the Casimir leading to the Klein-Gordon equation) we obtain a perturbative expansion
for a Schr¨odinger-like equation, where the zeroth-order Hamiltonian is the non-relativistic
Harmonic Oscillator Hamiltonian. From this Schr¨odinger equation we inmediately realize
that the minimal representation is not unitary because the perturbed Hamiltonian (as
opposite to the case of the hydrogen atom) is not Hermitian with respect to the measure
dx of the non-perturbed theory. Thus a perturbation of the scalar product itself is pro-
posed, and the solution coincides (at lower order in powers of 1
c2 ) with the exact solution
proposed in section 2.

2 The Relativistic Harmonic Oscillator

To quantize the physical system characterized by the algebra (1), we must exponentiate
this algebra and derive left and right vector ﬁelds. The left ones are1 (see [14] for the

left-invariant vector ﬁelds. There is a ﬁrst-order polarization, leading to the Bargmann-
Fock representation [14], but in this paper we are interested in the conﬁguration-space
representation, and for this purpose we need a higher-order polarization [12, 13].

One of the problems with this approach is the lack of a Schr¨odinder-like equation
providing an expresion of ˆH in terms of x and d
dx , since we have only at our disposal the
Klein-Gordon-like equation (4) and we would need its “square root”. In the next section
we shall obtain an expression for ˆH (at low order in 1/N) in terms of x and d
dx through
a Schr¨odinger-like equation derived from an inﬁnite-order polarization.

3 A Perturbative Approach Involving a Perturbed

Scalar Product

Another way of approaching the t-factorization problem consists in taking the “square
root” of the second-order polarization above, a solution to the conditions deﬁning an
(inﬁnite-order) polarization given in a power series < ˜X ∞t

This inﬁnite-order polarization can be solved order by order to obtain a perturbative

as σ is of order 1. If σ was of order c2 (i.e., λ of order 1), then the corrective terms would
appear at order 1 in the energy and at order 1/c2 in the wave function, as is the case
of the solutions considered in [6], as commented before. In this paper we shall restrict
ourselves to the case σ of order 1 (λ of order 1/c2), since it reproduces completely the
non-relativistic limit, not only the wave functions, but also the energy.

= n, the reason being that the perturbative terms
added to the non-relativistic Hamiltonian (19) are not Hermitian. It is important to stress
that with this perturbative approach one can see clearly why the energy wave funtions
are not orthogonal to each other, since we have an explicit expression for the Hamiltonian
(although at lower order in powers of 1/c2), and this proves to be non-Hermitian.

However,

We could add corrective terms to the perturbed Hamiltonian in order to make it
Hermitian (note that the Hermiticity of ˆH does not depend on the value of σ), but
since the expression of ˆH is given a priori, from a more general theory2, we are forced
to associate the problem with the scalar product, which is no longer adequate for the
perturbed theory. Thus, a perturbation of the scalar product itself is required, and this
2 as the perturbed
can be achieved by considering an arbitrary power expansion in c−
measure, and determining the corresponding coeﬃcients by using the condition that the
Hamiltonian be Hermitian at each order. As a result, we get the expression

expression, at least at lower order, for the Hamiltonian ˆH in terms of x and d
dx given by
(19).

We think that the present perturbative approach provides strong support to the idea
that Perturbation Theory must be in general modiﬁed in order to incorporate ”non-
Hermitian” corrections, like terms of the form x2 d2
dx2 , which appear as a consecuence of the
non-trivial curvature of the space-time (such as the Anti-de Sitter universe). Furthermore,
our particular example also constitutes an important step towards the solution of the
general Cauchy problem in non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes [16, 17], the Anti-de Sitter
universe being one of the few exactly solvable cases.

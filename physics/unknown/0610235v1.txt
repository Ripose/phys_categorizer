Abstract  It  is  pointed  out  that  due  to  two  reasons  the  currently  accepted  values

Doppler redshift. The real Doppler redshift is neglected actually. Based on the Friedmann’s equation 

of cosmology directly, we can easy deduce the formula of the Doppler redshift for the flat universe. It

three fourth of total material in our universe to be non-baryon dark material, if they exist indeed. The 

second  reason  is  that  the  observed  Doppler  redshift  and  luminosity  distance  of  supernovae  actually 

represent  the  past  time’s  values,  in  spite  of  the  present-day’s  values.  But  the  theoretical  curves  are 

drawn  based  on  the  present-day’s  universal  material  density  and  luminosity  distance.  So  the 

theoretical curves can not compare with observational results directly because the universal material 

densities  are  different  in  both  situations.  In  order  to  fit  them  consistently,  we  should  transform  the 

observational values which indicate the past states of supernovae into that of the present-day’s states. 

In this way, the currently accepted values of the universal material and dark energy densities would 

be sizably changed and the theory of cosmography would be affected greatly.

Let’s  first  prove  that  the  current  formula  used  to  calculate  the  cosmological  redshift  is  actually 

the  formula  of  gravitational  redshift,  in  spite of  that  of  the  Doppler  redshift.  As  we  known that  the

However, there exist two basic problems here. The first is that according to the Hubble law, the 

spectral  redshifts of galaxies  are  caused by  the  Doppler effects. But  the definition  (3) of  redshift  is 

not  that  of  the  Doppler  red-shift  actually.  Its  form  is  similar  to  the  gravitational  redshift  in  general 

relativity as shown in (13). It can be said that the redshift described by (5) is gravitational redshift in 

essence, in spite of the Doppler redshift. In fact, we can deduce the Doppler redshift formula of the 

universal  expansion  directly  based on  the  motion equation  (2)  without using  the  definition  (4).  The 

result  shows  that  the  Doppler  redshift’s  formula  is  completely  different  from  the  formula  (6).  For 

simplification,  we  only  discuss  the  redshift  of  the  flat  universal  expansion  with

what place observers measure it. Because light’s speed is finite, observers at place

gravitational  redshift,  caused  in  the  process  of  light’s  motion  in  gravitational  field,  depends  on  the 

present-day’s luminosity distances and the present day’s universal material density. As shown below, 

this difference is important for our discussion. 

On the other hand, as we known in special relativity that the formula of spectral frequency shift 

is deduced based on the invariability of phase under the Lorentz transformation. It is independent of 

gravitational  frequency  shift  which  is  based  on  the  concept  of  time  dilation  in  gravitational  field.

It is obvious that this kind of definition based on time dilation is different from that of the Doppler 

shift  defined  in  (7).  Having  nothing  to  do  with  the  moving  direction  of  light  source,  the  redshift 

shown in  (12)  is  actually purple  shift, in  spite of  red  shift.  So  this  kind  of  frequency  shift does  not 

exist  actually,  for  it  is  neither  the  Doppler  frequency  shift,  nor  gravitational  frequency  shift  (no

The  gravitational  redshift  defined  by  (4)  can  be  explained  as  follows.  In  the  process  of  the

( )tR   changes  with  time.  It  leads  to  the  change  of

definition of gravitational redshift is

In this case, there is no the Doppler frequency shift, but we still have gravitational frequency shift. 

Therefore, if cosmic redshift is considered to be caused by the Doppler effect, we can not explain it 

only depending on (5). Because the influence of gravitation on time scalar exists objectively, and its 

magnitude is the same as that of the Doppler effect, we should consider both simultaneously when we 

discuss the problem of cosmology.

But according to the new Hubble constant, we have

  and 

b <Ω

.
320

. So it can be said 

that the synthesis theory of nucleus does not claim actually that non-baryon dark material is main one 

in our universe.   

If  this  estimation  is  correct,  we  would  not  need  the  hypotheses  of  non-baryon  dark  material 

again. That is to say, the so-called problem of  missing material is actually caused by the neglect of 

the real Doppler red-shift. The concept of non-baryon dark material has been put forward for decades, 

but  up  to  now  we  can’t  find  them.  By  considering  the  Doppler  and  gravitational  redshifts 

simultaneously, this problem may be eliminated. At least, we don’t need to suppose more than three 

fourth of material in our universe to be non-baryon dark material. The current formation theory of the 

universal structure based on the hypotheses of non-baryon dark material should be modulated.   

        In this way, 

0H

  represents the Hubble constant corresponding to the Doppler redshift. What is 
H . So the universal age becomes

quantity having nothing to do the practical distance of supernovae and the time the observers observe. 
B   of  supernovae  is  not  an  absolute  quantity.  It  depends  on  practical  distance 
between observers and supernovae. Because supernovae always move away from observers, what we 

  is determined by light curve. It is a absolute 

But  the  brightness 

now  observe  are  the  past  time’s  rightness  of  supernovae.  Therefore, 

  represent  the  past  time’s

luminosity distances of supernovae, in spite of the present day’s ones. In fact, the different points in 

Fig.1 and 2 represent the different distances at different times for different supernovae. Light emitted 

by distant supernovae needs a long period of time to reach the earth. For example, for a celestial body 

with 

Z =

50.

, its light needed about 

910

  years to reach us. When we receive its light, the celestial 

body has moved to more distant place and its Doppler redshift would also change, i.e., the Doppler

redshift would not be

  again at moment we observe it. 

In this way, we see the second problem. The gravitational redshift described by (5) is caused in 

the process of photon’s motion in gravitational field. So the redshift observed by us at present time 

depends on the present day’s universal material density

  appearing  in  (5)  is  also  the  present 

day’s  luminosity  distance.  So  the  theoretical  curves  based  on  (5)  indicate  the  present  day’s  relation 

between  luminosity  distance  and  redshift  of  supernovae.  However,  if  the  observational  values  of 

redshifts  shown  in  Figs.  1  and  2  are  considered  to  be  caused  by  the  Doppler  effect,  they  would 

represent  the  past  time’s  relation.  Because  the  universal  material  densities  are  different  at  different 

past times, we can not compare the observational values with theoretical curves directly.   

In  order  to  comparing  them  consistently,  we  should  transform  the  observational  values  of  the

  into  that  of  current  time

produce an important influence on cosmology. For this purpose, we write (7) as

It  is  noted  that  when  the  Doppler  effect  is  used  to  explain  the  redshift  of  spectrum,  we  actually 

suppose that light’s speed is unchanged in its  moving process. So when light travels from the point

corresponds  to

  and 

5.2≈Ωλ

.  It  means  that  the  current  universal  material  density 

would be a negative number.  This result is absurd and unacceptable. Similarly, by transforming the 
1L

points on the fourth curve of Fig.2 into the present day’s values, we also obtain the lowest curve 

 

on the figure.

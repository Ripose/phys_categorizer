The "optical" version of the barn-pole problem 

Eric Baird  (eric_baird@compuserve.com) 

We present diagrams and simple calculations for the apparent (i.e. photographable) length of a moving 
ruler skimming the observer’s position, under three different classes of model. Special relativity’s 
predictions in this particular situation are the root-product average of the two more basic first-order 
predictions generated by simple “propagation timelag" arguments. We find that special relativity can 
legally predict either a photographable Lorentz contraction or a photographable Lorentz expansion in the 
"centred" ruler, depending on whether our camera is at the ruler’s “apparent” or “official” centre. 
 
 

1.  Introduction 

3.  Simple optical ruler-effects 

One of special relativity’s most contentious issues has 
been whether the length contraction effect originally 
proposed by Fitzgerald and Lorentz [1] should be 
considered to be “real” or not in Einstein’s model [2] 
(some authors argue that this question has no easy answer, 
e.g. [3] pp.76-77). In 1959 Terrell and Penrose 
independently identified what seemed to be a fifty-year 
misinterpretation of special theory’s predictions for 
photographable lengths [4][5], prompting a flurry of 
related papers [6]-[20], and inspiring the famous 
“barn/pole” or "polevaulter" problem [7] and a range of 
similar paradoxes or pseudo-paradoxes [8][9]. 1011121314151617181920 

We take a fresh look at the “polevaulter” problem by 
setting aside the usual arguments about calibrated 
coordinate systems, and instead using the distance 
information that will be recorded in a photographic image 
according to special relativity and other models.  

We find that, for a central “barn” observer, different 
definitions of transverse motion can lead to photographs 
being taken at different times, so that we obtain distinctly 
different images in which the overall length of the 
"transverse-moving" pole is seen to be either contracted or 
elongated. In each case, special relativity’s prediction is 
the “root product” average of the (non-paradoxical!) 
lengths that we would expect to see according to basic 
signal-propagation arguments [21][22].   

2.  Non-transverse Doppler effects 

The three fundamental radial Doppler equations for an 
object receding at v m/s are 
 

      freq’ / freq =  (c-v) / c 

      freq’ / freq =

      freq’ / freq =  c / (c+v) 

… (1) 

… (2) 

… (3) 

 
, where (1) and (3) are the basic propagation shift 
predictions associated with a “flat” medium stationary  
in the emitter and observer frames, and (2) is special 
relativity’s intermediate “relativistic Doppler” formula  
(v becomes negative for approach velocities). 

Recession or approach 

If a luminous ruler approaches or recedes from the 
observer, its apparent length in the direction of motion 
decreases or increases by the same ratio as the received 
frequency of its (Doppler shifted) light (“spatial 
equivalent of the Doppler effect” [23], [24][25][26]).  
The Doppler equations (1)-(3) dictate apparent lengths as 
well as apparent frequencies [27].  

Transverse motion (special case) 

While the ruler is passing the observer, the receding  
part of the ruler will appear to be contracted and the 
approaching part will appear to be elongated, and the  
total apparent length will then simply be the sum of these  
two apparent lengths.

APPARENT LENGTHS 

 

 

When the ruler is centred on the observer’s position, this 
calculation gives us a model’s prediction for the apparent 
length of a passing ruler for the special case of zero 
separation from the observer.  

Defining “centre” 

Although this method gives us an easy way of calculating 
a special-case transverse result from non-transverse 
Doppler relationships, we find that the outcome is 
sensitive to the precise moment at which the observer 
chooses to look at (or photograph) the moving ruler. Our 
“transverse” prediction has different values depending on 
whether we choose to look at the object at the moment 
when it is thought to be centred on the observer’s position, 
or at the moment when it seems to be centred on the 
observer’s position.  In other words, we get different 
“transverse” predictions depending on whether the 
observer coincides with the ruler’s “factory-marked” mid-
point or its “apparent” midpoint.

5.  Apparent centre 

For our first calculation, a ruler of nominal unit length is 
photographed at the exact moment that its factory-marked 
mid-point is adjacent to the camera.  

If we add the apparent lengths of the approaching and 
receding halves of the ruler, our three alternative Doppler 
equations give us predictions for the total apparent length 
of:

If we want to instead engineer a visible Lorentz 
contraction, we can choose to take our photograph at a 
slightly later time, when more of the passing ruler’s 
structure will be receding than approaching.  

At the moment when the ruler’s receding and approaching 
parts ruler are seen to have equal lengths, the total 
apparent lengths associated with each Doppler equation 
will be:

In each case, there is an offset between the object’s 
apparent mean position, [(xFRONT+xREAR)/2], and the its 
nominal centre of gravity,  
[(restlengthRECEDING = restlengthAPPROACHING)]. 

With equation (2) (special relativity), our centred ruler is 
seen to have an overall length that is Lorentz-dilated 
rather than Lorentz contracted [26][28].  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Note: Under special relativity, an approaching or receding 
object is seen to be Lorentz-contracted compared to tour 
expectation of its apparent length if we assumed that light 
“really” propagated throughout space at fixed speed in 
the observer’s frame.  
This "general" contraction effect is interpretative and 
depends on the belief system of the observer, since the 
same SR-compatible images also show a Lorentz 
elongation relative to our expectations for a simple aether 
fixed in the object’s frame. The decision to describe an 
SR-photographed object as being “really” contracted or 
“really” elongated is without physical consequence.  

Similar arguments apply to time-dilation effects – an  (SR) 
photographed image can be interpreted as including either 
a redshift component (“time dilation”) or a blueshift 
component (“Lorentz boost”), depending on whether we 
choose to compensate for the assumed first-order Doppler 
effects associated with equation (1) or (3).  

However, under special relativity there is not generally a 
viewable contraction in length relative to the object’s rest 
length, unless the stationary-aether prediction for apparent 
length happens to be the same as the rest length value, as 
it is in this particular special case.

6.  Barn-pole sequence  
(special relativity version) 

Figure 3 (below) illustrates the actual pole positions (faint 
outline) and the apparent pole positions (solid outline) that 
are seen by a centrally-placed barn observer in special 
relativity’s “barn-pole” problem [7]-[9] as the pole passes 
by the observer. The diagram shows a pole and barn both 
nominally 200m long, with factory markings at 10m 
intervals. The pole is moving from right to left, and the 
relative velocity is v=0.8c, giving a Lorentz factor of 
γ=0.6, and recession and approach length-change ratios 
(from equation (2)) of 1:3 and 3:1.  

We have selected four successive pole positions, where 
the central barn observer’s position coincides with  
a) the pole front, b) the pole’s “nominal” centre, c) the 
pole’s “apparent” centre, and d) the pole’s rear.  

If we calculate the apparent lengths using only the 
assumption of flat spacetime and propagation fixed to the 
observer’s frame (3), we get values of:  
a) 1000m, b) 555.5’m, c) 200m, and d) 111.1’m.  
Special relativity’s predictions are shorter than these 
values by the Lorentz ratio. 

Equivalent calculations from the assumption of light-
propagation fixed in the pole’s frame (1) give:  
a) 360m, b) 200m, c) 72m, and d) 40m. 
Special relativity’s predictions are the root product 
average of these two sets of first-order calculations. 

Under special relativity, if the barn and pole have the 
same nominal rest length and the relative velocity exceeds 
0.6c, the central barn observer will not see the front of the 
pole reaching the rear of the barn until the entire length of 
the pole is already receding from the observer. 

Fig. 3

b) 

c) 

d) 

The apparent lengths of the pole in these positions  
(as seen by the central barn observer) are then: 

a) 

b) 

c) 

The barn observer sees the approaching pole 
to be 600m long.  

The barn observer is adjacent to the factory-
marked centre of the pole, and sees the 
receding 100m to be reduced in length to 
33.3’m, and the approaching 100m to be 
dilated in length to 300m. The total apparent 
length is 333.3’m, which is a Lorentz 
elongation (333.3’m = 200m / (γ=0.6) ). 

180m of pole has already passed the 
observer, and only 20m is still approaching. 
The total apparent length is now  
(180/3) + (20×3) = 60 + 60 = 120m.  
The pole appears to be centred on the 
observer’s position, and appears to have an 
overall Lorentz length contraction  
(120m = 200m × (γ=0.6) ). 

d) 

The final 20m of pole has passed, and the 
total length of the receding pole now appears 
to be 200/3 = 66.6’m.

 It is important to remember that in c), where the pole is 
seen to occupy a Lorentz-contracted volume of barn space 
(and could be seen to fit into a correspondingly smaller 
barn), this apparent contraction effect does not apply 
equally to all parts of the pole structure. The object’s 
centre-of-gravity will appear displaced towards the 
receding side, and since more of the pole’s structure is 
receding from the observer than approaching, the pole’s 
signals will (in one sense) also have an “average” redshift. 

To obtain this “visible” transverse Lorentz contraction 
result, we have to define the “transverse-moving centre” 
of our object as being the mid-point of object’s two 
apparent end coordinates. For an apparently-centred ruler 
of total length L+L, the offset between the ruler’s 
“apparent” and “official” centres is  

offset = L v/c 

This relationship (where offset is a ruler-marked quantity) 
holds for all three Doppler formulae.  

Example: at v=0.8c, a 200m ruler will be seen to be 

centred when the observer is directly alongside the 
ruler’s “180m” mark.

7.  Conclusions 

In the limited situations described here, where our object 
subtends a 180° angle with the observer …  

1.  … We should expect to see apparent 

(“photographable”) length-contraction and expansion 
effects in passing objects, as basic first-order signal-
propagation artifacts.  

2.  … Special relativity’s predictions for apparent lengths 
are the root product average of the two corresponding 
first-order predictions.  

3.  … A single SR-compatible photograph can be 

interpreted as demonstrating the existence of Lorentz 
contraction or Lorentz expansion, depending on 
whether we decide to compensate for presumed first-
order length-change effects associated with (1) or (3).  

4.  … The SR photograph can also show a directly-
photographable overall Lorentz contraction or 
expansion relative to the object’s rest length, 
depending on whether the camera shutter is released 
when the object appears to be, or is deduced to be, 
centred on the camera’s position. 

Although the first three points are already documented, 
the fourth (sensitivity of the outcome to our definition of 
“transverse” motion) is not so widely appreciated.  

We would argue that the special theory’s results should 
only be presented as paradoxical if they generate 
numerically-conflicting predictions for the same directly-
observed (uninterpreted) data. Since apparent first-order 
length changes are not deemed paradoxical (they are also, 
after all, the conventional Doppler relationships for audio 
signals), special relativity’s average of these two first-
order predictions should also not be considered to be 
paradoxical (or radically different to earlier models).  

Much of the confusion about special relativity’s validity 
can be blamed on confusion over the correct meaning of 
“transverse” motion and on the common use of 
interpretative coordinate-system arguments (which can 
introduce additional conflicting assumptions and beliefs 
about the propagation of light) rather than on the theory’s 
actual, verifiable physical predictions.

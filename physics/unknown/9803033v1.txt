Comment on: Diﬀusion through a slab

Mahan [J. Math. Phys. 36, 6758 (1995)] has calculated the transmission coeﬃcient and angular
distribution of particles which enter a thick slab at normal incidence and which diﬀuse in the slab with
linear anisotropic, non-absorbing, scattering. Using orthogonality relations derived by McCormick
& Kuˇsˇcer [J. Math. Phys. 6, 1939 (1965); 7, 2036 (1966)] for the eigenfunctions of the problem, this
calculation is generalised to a boundary condition with particle input at arbitrary angles. It is also
shown how to use the orthogonality relations to relax in a simple way the restriction to a thick slab.

We consider the equation of radiative transfer with anisotropic scattering in a uniform slab, which occupies the
space 0 < z < D, together with a boundary condition which allows particles to enter the slab through the surface
z = 0 at an angle θ = arccos µ0 to the normal:1

1), Mahan2 has presented a solution to this problem which is valid only for µ0 = 1. Generalisation
For thick slabs (D
to arbitrary µ0 is of interest when, for example, the particles which enter the slab come from a point source at ﬁnite
distance, or diﬀuse before entering the slab. These problems require an integration over the range of incident angles.
Even for collimated beams, the experimental situation is generally one in which the particles are not normally incident.
Mahan’s method is not readily generalised to solve this problem: his Eq. (78) does not hold when µ0 6

In order apply the orthogonality relations, these equations must be multiplied by a weight function. This function,
denoted here and in McCormick & Kuˇsˇcer7 by γ(µ), is related, but not identical, to the γ(µ) deﬁned by Mahan2, and
is given by8

The functions B±(µ) can be calculated by multiplying Eq. (12) by φν′ (µ)γ(µ) and integrating over µ from 0 to 1.
Using the orthogonality relations14, one ﬁnds inhomogeneous Fredholm equations for B±(µ) which can be solved
by Neumann iteration15. In the thick slab approximation, where terms of order e−D are ignored, these Fredholm
equations are trivially solved. Equation (20) for as and j is then also trivial and independent of B±(µ):

However, the equations become complicated in this case.

Finally, it should be noted that McCormick & Kuˇsˇcer16 have also found orthogonality relations which can be used

to solve half-space transport problems with higher order anisotropy.

Abstract. A simple supersymmetric approach recently used by Dutt, Gan-
gopadhyaya, and Sukhatme (hep-th/9611087, Am. J. Phys., to appear) for
spherical harmonics is generalized to Gegenbauer and Jacobi equations.

The coordinate transformation procedure is well known to the authors writ-
ing on supersymmetric quantum mechanics (see section 5 in [1]). Essentially,
one starts with a one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation and tries to obtain a
new one by a coordinate transformation. In a recent work, Dutt, Gangopad-
hyaya and Sukhatme (DGS) [2] used a coordinate transformation to recast the
associated Legendre equation in the Schr¨odinger form and then employed the
concept of shape invariance to derive properties of spherical harmonics in a sim-
ple way. In the following, after presenting the case of spherical harmonics, we
generalize the DGS scheme to Gegenbauer and Jacobi equations.

1. Spherical harmonics
The equation for the associated Legendre polynomials

can be transformed into a Schr¨odinger eigenvalue equation by a mapping func-
tion θ = f (z) that can be found from the condition of putting to nought the
f = 2arctan(ez). This
coeﬃcient of the ﬁrst derivative. The result is θ
mapping is equivalent to the replacement sin θ = sechz and cos θ =
tanhz.
The range of the variable z is the full real line
. We notice that
θ(z) = π
2 + gd(z), where gd(z) is the so-called Gudermannian or hyperbolic
amplitude function [3]. The associated Legendre equation is transformed in one
of the best known shape invariant, exactly solvable Schr¨odinger equation

for which the algebraic supersymmetric scheme can be readily applied. Since l
is always an integer for the common spherical harmonics, Eq. (2) is moreover
a reﬂectionless one. The energy eigenvalues are known to be of the type En =

2. Gegenbauer polynomials

to be an associated Legendre function, q should be half-integer. To Eq. (5) one

can apply the change of function v = (1

From now on, we can apply the scheme of the previous section, i.e., obtaining

The n′(n′ + 1)sech2z potential is reﬂectionless if and only if n′ is an integer.

our discussion to be useful in such a context as well.

one can get the following form

and it is supposed that B < n
[8] such a Schr¨odinger equation corresponds to the motion of an electron in
a Coulomb ﬁeld in the presence of an Aharonov-Bohm potential and a Dirac
monopole potential.
It is also a Rosen-Morse II problem which is known to
be shape invariant and thus completely solvable by supersymmetric algebraic
methods [2]. The energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are in our notations as

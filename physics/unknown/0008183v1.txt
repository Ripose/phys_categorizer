Abstract 

There  is  demand  for  the  construction  of  a  medium-
energy  ion  linear  accelerator  based  on  superconducting 
rf  (SRF)  technology.  It  must  be  capable  of  producing 
several  hundred  kilowatts  of  CW  beams  ranging  from 
protons  to  uranium. A considerable amount of power is 
required  in  order  to  generate  intense  beams  of  rare 
isotopes 
for  subsequent  acceleration.  At  present, 
however, the beam power available for the heavier ions 
would  be  limited  by  ion  source  performance.  To 
overcome  this  limit,  we  have  studied  the  possibility  of 
accelerating  multiple-charge-state 
(multi-Q)  beams 
through  a  linac.  We  show  that  such  operation  is  made 
feasible  by 
longitudinal 
acceptance  which  can  be  obtained  in  a  linac  using 
superconducting  cavities.    Multi-Q  operation  provides 
not only a substantial increase in beam current, but also 
enables the use of two strippers, thus reducing the size of 
linac  required.  Since  the  superconducting  (SC)  linac 
operates 
in  CW  mode,  space  charge  effects  are 
essentially  eliminated  except  in  the  ECR/RFQ  region. 
Therefore  an  effective  emittance  growth  due  to  the 
multi-charge beam acceleration can be minimized.

1 INTRODUCTION 

A  preliminary  design  and  beam  dynamics  study  has 
been  performed  for  the  rare  isotope  accelerator  (RIA) 
driver linac structure and is discussed elsewhere [1,2]. A 
schematic view of the linac is shown in Fig.1.

The  linac  contains  three  main  sections:  a  ‚Äúpre-
stripper‚Äù  section  up  to  the  first  stripping  target  at  12.3 
MeV/u, a medium energy section defined and separated 
by  the  stripper targets and a high energy section with a 
maximum uranium energy of 400 MeV/u. Total voltage 
of the linac is 1.36 GV. The pre-stripper section consists 

of  an  ECR  ion  source  followed  by  mass  and  charge 
selection,  an  initial  linac  section  consisting  of  an  RFQ 
and 96 low-beta independently-phased SRF cavities. The 
middle  section  is  based  on  168  intermediate-beta  SRF 
cavities.  The  high-energy  section  consists  of  172 
elliptical cavities designed for three different velocities. 
The heaviest ions, which are not fully stripped at the first 
stripper,  will  be  stripped  a  second  time  at  ~85  MeV/u. 
The charge state distribution of uranium ions is centered 
at  the  charge state q0=+75 at 12.3 MeV/u from the first 
stripper.  Five  charges  encompassing  ~80%  of  the 
incident beam after the first stripper will be accelerated 
simultaneously  in  the  medium--  section.  After  the 
second stripper, 98% of the beam is in five charge states 
neighbouring q0 = 89, all of which can be accelerated to 
the end of the linac. 

The accelerating field taking into account the cryostat 
filling varies from 1.6 MeV/m to 5 MeV/m. Transverse 
beam focusing over all of the driver linac is provided by 
SC solenoids. The length of the focusing period depends 
on the resonator type.  

The behaviour of the uranium multi-Q beam has been 
studied  both  by  analytical  and  numerical  methods.  The 
effects  of  various  factors,  such  as  beam  mismatch, 
misalignments, accelerating field errors and other factors 
affecting  the  emittance  growth  of  a  multi-Q  beam  are 
discussed.

(TTF)  is  a  complicated  function  of  both  the  field 
distribution and the particle velocity. At low energy, the 
particle  velocity  may  change  appreciably  during  the 
passage  through  a  multiple  gap  cavity.  For  this  reason, 
the TTF is most conveniently calculated numerically.

We define the synchronous phase for a given particle 
traversing  a  given  field  with  respect  to  that  rf  phase 

producing  maximum  energy  gain.    The  synchronous 
phase,  as  with  the  TTF,  is  generally  most  conveniently 
determined  numerically.  The  synchronous  motion of an 
ion with charge state q can be considered as motion in an 
equivalent  traveling  wave  with  the  amplitude  Em= 
E0T(-,-G). For beam energies higher than several MeV/u 
the  accelerating  field  Em can be considered as changing 
adiabatically  along  the  linac.  At  lower  energies  the 
adiabatic  conditions  of  ion  motion  are  not  valid  due  to 
the large increment of beam velocity in the cavity.

A  heavy-ion 

is  usually  designed  for 

the 
acceleration  of  many  ion  species.  In  a  SC  linac  the 
cavities,  fed  by  individual  rf  power  sources,  can  be 
independently phased. The phase setting can be changed 
to  vary  the  velocity  profile  for  synchronous  motion 
along  the  linac.    For  a  given,  fixed  phase  setting,  the 
synchronous  velocity  profile,  and  the  TTF  profile  are 
fixed  along  the  accelerator.  To  accelerate  ions  with  a

In  an  independently  phased  cavity  array  such  as  an 
SRF  ion  linac,  beams  of  different  charge-to-mass  ratio 
can  be  accommodated  by  changing  either  or  both  the 
phase and amplitude of the electric field.  Allowing both 
parameters  to  vary  permits  the  option  of  varying  the 
velocity  profile.  This  can  provide  higher  energies  per 
nucleon for ions with a higher charge-to-mass ratio.  

The  RIA  driver  linac  will  accelerate  uranium  ions  at 
charge  state  q0=75  after  the  first  stripper  and  at  q0=89 
after the second stripper. The simultaneous acceleration 
of neighbouring charge states becomes possible because 
the  high  charge-to-mass  ratio  makes  the  required  phase 
offsets  small  for  a  limited  states  of  charge  states.    We 
note that different charge states of equal mass will have 
the same synchronous velocity profile along the linac if 
the condition

is  fulfilled.  The  simultaneous  acceleration  of  ions  with 
different charge states requires an injection of the beam 
with each charge state q at a synchronous phase which is

The  separatrices  for  charge  states  q=73,75  and  77 
calculated in a conservative approximation are shown in 
Fig.  3.  Each  particle  with  different  charge  state  q 
oscillates  around 
its  own  synchronous  phase  with 
slightly  different  amplitude  [2].  It  would  be  entirely 
feasible to eliminate the relative oscillations. If the linac 
has been tuned for the acceleration of some charge state 
q0,  then  the  particle  bunches  of  different,  neighbouring 
charge states could be injected into the linac at different, 
neighbouring rf phases in order for each charge state to 
be  matched  precisely  to  its  own  phase  trajectory.  The 
higher  the  charge  state,  the  sooner  it  must  arrive  at  a 
given  point  to  be  matched.  One  possible  method  of 
adjusting the phase of multiple charge states would be a 
magnetic system combined with rf cavities.

For  most  applications,  however,  such  a  system  is  not 
necessary  since  the  acceleration  of  a  multi-Q  beam  is 
possible  even  without  matching  the  different  charge 
states  to  their  proper  synchronous  phase.  If  all  charge 
states  are  injected  at  the  same  time  (at  the  same  rf 
phase),  then,  as  described  above,  each  charge  state 
bunch will perform coherent oscillations with respect to 
the  tuned  charge  state  q0.  One  can  view  this  as  an 
increase in the total (effective) longitudinal emittance of 
the  multi-Q  beam,  relative  to  the  (partial)  longitudinal 
emittance  of  the  individual  charge  state  bunches.    For 
the  heavy-ion  SRF 
the 
longitudinal  emittance  is  predominantly  determined  by 
the  injector  RFQ,  and  can  be  made  as  small  as    ~2.0 
keV/ubnsec  for  a  single  charge-state  beam  [3].  For 

linac  being  considered, 

comparison,  the  linac  acceptance,  given  by  the  area  of 
the  separatrix  shown  in  Fig.  3,  for  q0=75  is  ~77 
keV/ubnsec.    As  will  be  shown  below,  this  provides 
ample  headroom  for  the  effective  emittance  growth 
introduced by the acceleration of multiple charge states. 
It  should  be  noted  that  if  no  phase-matching  is  done 
for  different  charge  states,  additional  emittance  growth 
will occur at frequency transitions in the linac.  Heavy-
ion  linacs  typically  have  several  such  transitions  to 
permit  efficient  operation  over  the  large  velocity  range 
required.    In  the  RIA  driver  linac  the  strippers  will  be 
placed  in  the  region  of  frequency  transitions  thereby 
eliminating  effective  emittance  growth  of  multi-Q 
beams. 

2.2 Transverse beam dynamics 

We  now  consider  the  transverse  phase  space  for  this 
same  uranium  beam  through  the  medium--  section  of 
the linac. The focussing period is defined by a lattice of 
a SC solenoid following each pair of SRF cavities. The 
present 
linac  design  calls  for  solenoid  focussing 
elements because SC solenoids are cost effective for this 
application, but the following analysis is not particularly 
restricted by this choice.   

Table  I  shows  the  Twiss  parameters  for  5  different 
charge states calculated for the focusing period at the 12 
MeV/u  region  of  the  linac.  The  difference  in  Twiss 
parameters  for  five  charge  states  is  sufficiently  small 
that  all  the  charge  states  can  be  injected  into  the  linac 
with  the  same  transverse  parameters  producing  an 
effective emittance growth of 6.5%.  

The  transverse  beam  emittance  is  determined  by  the 
ECR  source.  Present-day  ECR  sources  can  produce 
beam  intensities  up  to  ~1 p2A for a single charge state 
of  uranium,  with  an  normalized  emittance  (containing 
90% of the particles) equal to ~0.2 5bmmbmrad [4]. We 
compare this emittance with the transverse acceptance of 
the  solenoidal  focussing  channel  of  the  driver  linac 
assuming 2x=60¬∞, -x,max = 3.17 mm/mrad.  The maximum 
value  of  the  -x  -function  occurs  at  the  center  of 
solenoids,  which  has  a  bore  radius  of  15  mm.    This 
implies a normalized acceptance An = 11.6 5bmmbmrad. 
The  acceptance  of  this  section  is  ~50  times  larger  than 
the  beam  emittance  at  the  entrance.  It  should  be  noted 
that  the  acceptance  of  the  next  linac  section,  the  high 
energy part, is even larger, ~100 5bmmbmrad. 
Transverse  emittance  can  grow  due  to  several  error 
effects. We discuss below two type of errors which can 
most seriously impact the multi-Q beam dynamics. The 
first  type  of  error,  mismatch,  is  caused  by  errors  in 
tuning  or  matching  the  beam  into  the  linac  and  arises 
because  of  errors  in  measurement  of  the  input  beam 
parameters.  The  second  type  of  error  is  transverse 
displacements of the focussing lenses.

One  aspect  of  this  behaviour  can  be  illustrated  by 
considering  a  mismatched  beam 
the  58 
focussing periods of the linac between the two strippers.  
While  the  actual  linac  lattice  will  be  slightly  more 
complex,  it  is  sufficient  for  us  to  consider  the  periodic 
focussing  structure  as  having  constant  length.      We 
assume  the  solenoids  to  be  tuned  for  a  phase  advance 
over  one  period  of  2x  =  60¬∞,  for  charge  state  75.   
Although the phase advance per period does not depend 
strongly  on  the  charge  state,  over  58  periods  the  phase 
differences  between  different  charge  states  become 
appreciable. If the input beam is mismatched, the phase 
space  ellipse  begins  to  rotate,  at  twice  the  betatron 
frequency, tracing out a (matched) ellipse of larger area.  
Fig.  4  shows  beam  envelopes  both  for  a  single  charge 
state  beam  and  also  for  a  five  charge  state  beam.    The 
oscillations of the mismatched beam remain coherent for  
the single charge state, but not for the multi-Q case.  To 
summarize, the main difference between one- and multi-
Q beams is that mismatch of a single charge state beam 
is generally correctable, and does not lead to transverse 
emittance growth. For multiple charge states, correction 
is more difficult, and will generally induce growth in the 
transverse emittance. 

calculated as the center of gravity of a five charge state 
beam with q=73‚Ä¶77. The results are shown in Fig. 5. It 
can  be  seen  that  the  emittance growth factor has, in all 
cases, been reduced to less than 3.  For the entire set of 
cases of random errors, the most probable value for the 
effective  emittance  growth  factor  is  1.4.  The  steering

the 

Multi-Q  beams  are  also  more  severely  affected  by 
misalignment  errors. 
  Misalignments  produce  a 
transverse  magnetic  field  on 
linac  axis  and 
coherently  deflect  the  beam.  For  a  single  charge  state 
beam,  misalignment  causes  lateral  displacement  of  the 
beam,  but  no  emittance  growth  so  long  as  the  beam 
remains  in  the  linear  region  of  the  focussing  elements.  
With  a  beam  containing  multiple  charge  states,  the 
differing  betatron  periods,  as  well  as  the  differing 
displacements, cause growth in the transverse emittance.                       
We  have  performed  Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  the 
dynamics of multi-Q beams in the presence of alignment 
errors.  We considered a five charge-state uranium beam 
in that portion of the linac between the first and second 
strippers.    To  make  the  simulation  more  realistic,  we 
assumed a mismatch factor of 1.2 for the beam out of the 
first  stripper.    We  introduced  alignment  errors  by 
displacing  separately  both  ends  of  each  of  the  58 
focussing  solenoids  in  both  x  and  y  by  an  amount 
randomly  varying  over  the  range  ¬±300  2m.    The  bar 
graph  in  Fig. 5 is a histogram of the simulation results.  
Note  that  for  some  sets  of  alignment  errors,  the 
emittance growth factor can be as high as 8.5.

We  have  shown  [3]  that  it  is  possible  to  accept  two 
charge  states  from  an  ECR  and  accelerate  both  to  the 
first stripping target at 12 MeV/u. The ECR is followed 
by  an  achromatic  bend  with  a  charge  selector  which 
transports  a  two-charge-state  uranium  beam  to  the 
entrance  of  a  multi-harmonic  buncher  upstream  of  the 
RFQ.  The  fundamental  frequency  of  both  bunchers  is 
one  half  of  the  RFQ  frequency.  A  combination  of  the 
multi-harmonic  buncher  and  RFQ  bunches  more  than 
80%  of  each  charge  state 
low 
longitudinal  emittance  (total  emittance  is  lower  than  
~2.0 5bkeV/ubnsec)  beam  at the output of the RFQ. The 
second  buncher  is  located  directly  before  the  RFQ 
entrance  and  changes  the  average  velocities  of  each 
charge  state  to  the  design  input  velocity  of  the  RFQ. 
Over  the  distance  between  the  first,  multi-harmonic 
buncher, and second buncher the bunched beams of each 
charge state are formed with a separation by 360G at the 
RFQ frequency due to the different average velocities of 
each  charge  state.  Electrostatic  quadrupoles  provide 
focussing  and 
the  RFQ 
acceptance.  The  results  of 
the  design  and  beam 
dynamics  studies  are  presented  at  this  conference  (see 
ref. [3]).

3.2 Five charge state beam in the medium-- 
linac  

We  have  carried  out  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  of 
multi-Q beam acceleration from the first stripper through 
the  second  stripper  and  continuing  to  the  end  of  the 
linac.  The simulation starts with a 12.3 MeV/u uranium 
beam equally distributed over 5 charge states, all at the 
same  rf  phase,  and  with  a  longitudinal  emittance  ~1.0 
5bkeV/ubnsec. We consider in detail the behaviour of this 
beam  between  the  two  strippers,  a  section  of  linac 
consisting of 3-gap SRF cavities operating at 172.5 MHz 
and  345  MHz.  The  rf phase throughout this section has 
been  set  for  acceleration  of  uranium  with  charge  state 
q0=75  at  synchronous  phase  s,75=-30¬∞.    The  phase  is 
calculated  using values of the electric field numerically

Even  for  the  multi-Q  beams,  however,  emittance 
growth can be substantially reduced by simple corrective 
steering  procedures. 
this  by 
assuming  a  measurement  of  the  beam  centroid  position 
and corrective steering to be performed once every four 
focussing periods.  This interval would correspond to the 
space  between  cryomodules  in  the  benchmark  linac 
design.  

  We  have  modelled 

The  transverse  tune  has  important  effects. 

  We 
consider  the  case  of  a  60¬∞  phase advance per focussing 
period.    For  this  case,  the  phase  advance  between  the 
points at which monitoring and steering is performed is 
x  =  240¬∞.  This  rotation  in  transverse  phase  space 
transforms  a  centroid  displacement  at  one  corrective 
station  to  a  deflection  at  the  succeeding  station,  which 
can be directly corrected by simple one-element steering 
at  that  point.  In  our  simulations,  the  beam  center  was 

generated  using  realistic  cavity  geometries.  The  beam 
tracking simulation was done with a modified version of 
the  LANA  code  [2].  This  code  completely  simulates 
beam  dynamics  in  the  six-dimensional  phase  space 
including alignment errors. The phase space plot of all 5 
charge state bunches at Wn=85.5 MeV/u, just before the 
second  stripper,  is  shown  in  Fig.  6  together  with  the 
acceptance  of  805  MHz  elliptical  SRF  structure.  The 
acceptance is obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. After 
the  second stripper, the effective longitudinal emittance 
of the multi-Q beam is increased by a factor of ~6. We 
note,  however,  that  this  longitudinal  emittance  is  still 
substantially  less  than  the  acceptance  of  the  remaining 
portion of the SC linac.

The  effect  of  rf  field  errors  on  longitudinal  beam 
dynamics  in  a multi-cavity linac becomes significant in 
the  present  case mainly because of the large number of 
individual  cavities.  These  errors  are  caused  by 
fluctuations,  which  we  assume  to  be  random,  in  the  rf 
phase and amplitude of the electromagnetic fields in the 
cavities.  We  have  performed  numerical  simulation  to 
estimate the effects of this latter class of error, for both 
single-charge-state  and  also  for  multi-Q  beams.  The 
error  effects  are  included  by  introducing  phase  and 
amplitude  errors  for  each  of  the  cavities,  randomly 
distributed over the indicated range.  We have found [2] 
that even including both these effects, the total increase 
in 
the 
acceptance  of  the  high  energy  part  of  the  driver  linac,  
~77 5bkeV/ubnsec. 
The  construction  of  a  high-intensity  heavy-ion  linac 
requires  at  least  two  stripping  foils.  In  order  to  avoid 
beam losses in the high-energy part of the linac the low-
intensity  unwanted  charge  states  must  be  carefully 
separated  and  dumped.  It  will  require  a  system 
containing  dipole  magnets  and  a  rebuncher  in  order  to 
provide a unit transformation of the 6-dimensional beam 
phase space (see Fig.1). We have designed such systems 
for  several  cases:  a  180G  bend,  a  parallel  translation  of 
~4.5  m  and  a  chicane-like  system  for  the  straight  line 
transformation.  After  the  stripping  target,  all  charge 

longitudinal  emittance 

is  still  well  below 

states have the same velocity, therefore, such a matching 
system is isopath for different charge states.  

3.3 Multi-Q beam test at ATLAS 

A  test  of  the  acceleration  of  multi-Q  beams  was 
performed  at  the  ATLAS  accelerator.  A  238U+26  beam 
from  an  ECR  ion  source  was  accelerated  to  286  MeV 
(~1.2  MeV/u)  and  stripped  just  before  the  ‚ÄòBooster‚Äô 
section  of  ATLAS.    All  charge  states  near  q0=38  were 
simultaneously  accelerated 
the  Booster.  The 
parameters  of  each  selected  charge  state  were  carefully 
measured.  Tuning  of  the  focusing  fields  to  get  100% 
transmission  was  accomplished  with  the  58Ni+9  guide 
beam  prior  to  switching  to  the  uranium  mixed  beam. 
About  94%  transmission  of  the  multi-Q  uranium  beam 
was detected. Six charge states were accelerated through 
the Booster with an average energy spread within 1.5%. 
Detailed experimental results are given in ref. [5].

4 CONCLUSIONS  

The  large  longitudinal  and  transverse  acceptance 
characteristic of superconducting heavy-ion linacs makes 
possible the acceleration of multiple charge state beams.  
Our studies indicate that it is quite feasible to accelerate 
2  charge  states  of  uranium  from  an  ECR  to  the  first 
stripper, 5 charge states of the same beams after the first 
stripper  and  5  charge  states  after  the  second  stripper  in 
this  linac.  Such  operation  could  provide  ~120  kW  of 
uranium  beam  using  a  demonstrated  performance  of  an 
ECR ion sources.

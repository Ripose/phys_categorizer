Abstract 

We report the results of observations of H- beam 
instabilities  at  the  Fermilab  Linac.  By  intentionally 
creating “high” background pressure with different gases 
in  the  750  keV  transport  line  we  observed  coherent 
transverse  beam  oscillations.  The  minimal  pulse  length 
required  to  observe  oscillations  and  the  frequency  of 
oscillations  are  functions  of  pressure  and  mass  of  the 
background  gas.  The  oscillations  are  present  in  both 
transverse  planes  and  very  quickly  reach  saturation  in 
amplitude  growth.  The  observed  characteristics  of  beam 
oscillations  are  in  quantitative  agreement  with  “fast 
beam-ion  instability”  described  by  Raubenheimer  and 
Zimmermann[1].  Effects  described  here  are  occur  far 
from  the  normal  operating  range  of  the  Fermilab  Linac 
but  may  be  important  for  many  future  high  intensity 
accelerators.  
 

1  INTRODUCTION 

In  1985  a  BPM  system  was  introduced  in  the  Fermilab 
Linac[2]  and  fast  H-  beam  transverse  oscillations  were 
noticed  when  the  pressure  of  the  750  keV  line  was 
degraded  by  turning  off  the  large  ion pump near the H- 
source. Recently we have revisited this phenomena in the 
light of renewed interest in this type of beam instability. 
In many future rings, this transient instability is predicted 
to  have  very  fast  growth  rates,  much  faster  than  the 
damping  rates  of  existing  and  proposed  transverse 
feedback systems, and thus is a potential limitation. The 
instability  described  in  this  paper  is  caused  by  residual 
gas ions. Charged particle beams, traversing a beam line 
or circulating in a storage ring, ionize the residual gas and 
generate 
instability 
mechanism is the same in the beam line and storage rings 
assuming  that  ions  are  not  trapped  turn  by  turn  in  the 
rings. The ions generated by the head portion of the beam 
pulse  oscillate  in  the  transverse  direction  causing  a 
growth  of  the  initial  perturbation  of  the  beam.  In  our 
case, ions of the background gas are trapped and focused 
by H- beam. They start to oscillate and create transverse 
deformation  of  the  H-  beam.  The  model  employed  by 
Raubenheimer  and  Zimmermann 
in  quantitative 
agreement  with  our  observations.  In  this  model  all  ions 
oscillate  with  the    same  frequency,  the  frequency  of 
small-amplitude  oscillations  of  the  centroid  in  the 
potential  well  of  the  beam.  In  our  experiment  we  see  a 

free  electrons  and 

ions.  The 

is 

frequency  spread  of  oscillations  which  increases  with 
pressure.  
 

2 EXPERIMETAL SETUP 

During  the  experiment,  a  750keV  H-  DC  beam  was 
transported  along  a  10  meter  long  transport  line  to  the 
buncher  cavity  and  Drift  Tube  Linac,  see  figure  1.  The 
beam  size  along  the  line  does  not  change  significantly 
and averages about 2 cm in diameter. The peak current of 
the beam was 65 mA at a starting background pressure of 
1.2e-6  Torr.  The  background  gas  was  mostly  hydrogen 
gas  from  the  Ion  source.  The  pulse  length  of  35  us  is 
created using a chopper which is at the beginning of the 
line. Vacuum in the transfer line was maintained using a 
turbo  pump  near  the    Chopper  and  another  by  Tank#1. 
The  pressure  in  the  line  was  measured  using  an  Ion 
Gauge  near  the  gas  bleeding  valve  that  was  used  for 
introducing  different  gases  and  creating  different 
pressures in the line.

linac, see figure 2. It is known that transmission through 
the  linac  is  very  dependent  on  the  quad  settings  in  the 
line. We have not measured beam profiles in the line but 
know  that  the  Buncher  is  an  aperture  restriction  in  the 
line,  and  the  high  transmission  is  achieved  only  if  the 
beam  has  a  waist  at  the  Buncher  position.  We  can  say 
with some degree of confidence that the high background 
gas pressure did not change the beam profile in the line. 
Under  normal  operation,  the  pressure  in  the  line  is 
2.4x10-6  and  in  the  experiment  the  highest  pressure  was 
1.0x10-4.

The lower trace in figure 3 is a beam position signal from 
the  BPM  at  the  entrance  to  Tank#3  under  normal 
operation with pressure in the line of 2.4x10-6Torr. Small 
fluctuation  of  the  signal  are  result  of  the  noise  in  the 
beam and pick-up. Upper trace is the same signal with a 
pressure in the line of 4.8x10-5 Torr. It is clear that

during  the  pulse.  The  signals  were  recorded  using  a 
LeCroy scope. For measurements of the beam oscillation 
frequency,  FFT  signals  were  averaged  over  many  beam 
pulses.  To  avoid  any  frequency  signal  not  related  with 
beam  oscillations  only  the  last  30  us  of  the  beam  pulse 
was Fourier analysed. There was no noticeable difference 
between  horizontal  and  vertical  planes,  so  all  data  was 
taken looking at the horizontal plane only. 

2 RESULTS 

Using  a  bleeding  valve  in  the  middle  of  the  transfer 
line  measurements  were  repeated  for  several  different 
gases. We used hydrogen, helium, argon and krypton as 
the  background  gas.  With  the  bleeding  valve  we  where 
able to  
have fine control of the pressure in the line.

4  CONCLUSIONS 

We  have  intentionally  created  coherent  transverse  beam 
oscillations.  The  oscillations  have 
following 
characteristics: 

the 

time 

to  develop  oscillations  strongly 
depends on the pressure but not much to the gas 
species, 
It takes only a few oscillations for the instability 
to fully develop and saturate. 

•  At low gas pressure, the oscillation frequency is 

•  The 

• 

~0.5MHz  . 

•  At higher gas pressure, the oscillation frequency 

peaks at ~1.1MHz  for all gas species.

oscillations  start  about  1.2  m s  after  the  start  of  beam, 
develop  very  quickly  and  saturate  after  one  or  two  full 
oscillations. The time for oscillations to develop and the 
frequency of oscillations depend on the pressure and type 
of  background  gas.  Figure  4  shows  scope  traces  of  the 
beam  position  for  different  gas  pressures  in  Torr,  when 
the  background  gas  is  argon.  To  measure  the  frequency 
of  oscillations  we  used  an  FFT  option  built  into  the 
LeCroy scope.

Figure  5  shows  four  traces:  beam  position,  beam 
intensity, FFT of beam position signal and the average of 
the last 23 FFT beam signals. To exclude no-beam related 
signals as in Figure 5 that come from noise on the pick-
up,  we  used  only  the  last  30  us  of  the beam signal. For 
low  gas  pressure  we  see  a  relatively  sharp  frequency 
signal in the range of 0.5 MHz. As pressure is increased 
the  frequency  signal  is  broadened  and  moves  toward 
higher frequency with the peak at 1.1 MHz for all gases.

Abstract: 
 
Understanding of the transport in a Tokamak plasma is an important issue. Various mechanisms 

have  been  reported  in  the  literature  to  relate  the  core  phenomenon  to  edge  phenomenon.  

Sawtooth  and  Mirnov  oscillations  caused  by  MHD  instabilities  are  generally  observed  in 

Tokamak  discharges.  Observation  of  these  effects  in  the  visible  radiation  from  outer  edge  may 

offer a possible means to understand the transport. 

Oscillations in the visible radiation from outer region of the plasma have been observed during 

recent Aditya discharges. Percentage modulation of these oscillations vary with the Lines of Sight 

(LOS) of the chords and surfaces on which they terminate. This has been found in both the low 

frequency (~ 1 kHz) oscillations that seem to correlate with sawteething in SXR signals and the 

higher  frequency  (~  10  kHz)  oscillations  that  correlate  well  with  Mirnov  signals  indicative  of  

m/n  =  2/1  mode  rotation.  This  suggests  that  the  extent  to  which  the  MHD  instabilities  in  the 

central region of the plasma column are reflected in the edge radiation depends on the interaction 

of  the  plasma  with  the  surface  at  the  extremity  of  the  LOS.  The  release  of  particle/  energy 

accompanying  the  MHD  instabilities  leads  to  a  large  influx  of  particles  from  such  surfaces. 

Cross-bispectral analysis   suggests   that a mode (having frequency of ~ 20 kHz) is also generated 

due  to  the  interaction  of  m/n  =1/1  (~10  kHz,  seen  in  SXR)  and  m/n  =  2/1  (~10  kHz,  seen  in 

Mirnov,  Visible  &  Microwave  Interferometer  signals).  By  possible  selection  rules,  this  mode 

seems to be a m/n = 3/2 mode. This mode is seen in Mirnov, Visible & Interferometer signals.  

Behaviour of these oscillations on various LOS and their relation to SXR & Mirnov signals can 

lead to an understanding of the transport phenomenon. These observations and our interpretations 

will be presented.

Introduction: 
 
In  this  paper  we  report  experimental  observations  on  Aditya  tokamak  discharges,  in 
which the sawteething activity in the core leads to periodic changes in the Ha  signals with 
a  surprisingly  short  delay  of  200  microsec.  These  modulations  are  also  observed in  the 
ECE  emissions  from  different  radial  locations  between  the  core  and  the  edge,  with  the 
delay  periods  progressively  increasing  outwards.  These  observations  are  strongly 
reminiscent of many observations in SXR and ECE emissions from other tokamak [1-4] 
and  other  magnetic  confinement  machines  [5],  which  have  lead  to  the  postulation  of  a 
fast  propagation  of  the  energy  released  in  a  sawtooth  [ST]  crash,  as  a  “heat  pulse”  (by 
which  usually  an  electron  temperature  pulse  is  meant).  In  the  light  of  available 
experimental  evidence  from  Aditya,  we  have  tried  to  infer  the  nature  of  the  causal 
connection  between  the  Ha   modulation  and  sawteething  in  terms  of  heat  pulse 
propagation.    
 
In the first section of the following, the experimental details of the Aditya Tokamak and 
the parameters of discharges typical of the ones analyzed in this paper are given. In the 
next section all the observations that bear upon the possible link between ST oscillations 
in  the  core  and  modulations  in  emissivity  of  Ha   in  the  edge,  are  described.  This  is 
followed  by  an  analysis  of  the  observations  to  evaluate  their  consistency  with  the  fast 
propagation of energy. 
 
Aditya Tokamak: 
 
The  ADITYA    [6]  tokamak    (R  =  75  cm,  BT  =  0.75  T,  a  =  25  cm  with  SS  wall  and  a 
poloidal  graphite  limiter)  has  been  producing  ohmically  heated  circular  plasma 
discharges. Typical parameter are: duration 70-80 ms, IP ~ 65-75 kA, ne(0)  ~ 1.5x1013  
cm-3, and Te (0) ~300 eV. The central chord 
averaged electron density is measured by a 
microwave  interferometer.  The  estimation 
of  electron  temperature  is  by  the  ratio 
method  using  soft  X-ray  emission  from 
core.  Bolometer  collecting  VUV  radiations 
along a chord passing through center of the 
plasma  gives  an  estimation  of  radiated 
power.  The  impurities  line  emissions  and 
Ha   emissions  are  routinely  monitored  by 
PMT-Interference filter based detectors and 
incidence  VUV  monochromator 
normal 
(NIM).  A  multichannel 
heterodyne 
radiometer detects the ECE emissions from 
different  radial  locations.  A  set  of  15 
Mirnov  coils  monitors  poloidal  magnetic 
field fluctuations. Fig. 1 shows the location 
of different diagnostics on Aditya tokamak.

Results: 
 
Figure 2 shows Soft X-Ray (SXR) signals along a chord passing through plasma center 
and  another  along  an  off  center  chord.  The  sawtooth  period  is  about  1  msec  and  the 
modulation is 30%. The core temperature (derived from the ratio of this signal to another 
filtered  with  Be-foil)  is  seen  to  change  between  300  eV  (pre  crash)  and  250  eV  (post 
crash). In SXR signals the inverse ST pattern is seen usually along chords off centered by 
6 cm and often in the  3 cm chord. From this we infer that the q = 1 radius is typically 
about  5  cm  or  smaller.  The  spatial  resolutions  of  the  SXR  detectors  and  the  small 
modulation in the weaker signals from the outer chords do not permit us to ascertain the 
inversion radius with higher precision for any particular shot. The above data leads to an 
estimate  of  ~  2· 1019  eV  (which  of  course  critically  depends  on  rq=1)  for  the  energy 
released from the core (q<1 region) during a ST crash.

Figure 3 shows the Ha  signal monitored along an edge chord terminating on Aditya’s top 
limiter  tile  (see  inset  of  figure  1  for  the  line  of  sight  of  the  Ha   detector).  Similar 
oscillations  are  also  observed  on  the  CIII  signal  along  same  chord.  The  oscillation 
corresponding to the ST (resembling more the inverse ST pattern) is evident in the signal 
itself. The cross correlations of the two signal yields an average value of ~ 210 microsec 
for the delay between ST crash and the Ha  peak. Similar observations of ST oscillations 
modulating the Ha  emissivity have been reported in many machines [3-5, 7].

Fig. 3: Cross correlation between SXR and Ha  shows 0.2 msec delay

 
Observation  of  similar  delay  has  been  reported  for  modulations  in  HXR  detectors 
correlating to SXR sawteeth in PLT [8] and Pulsator [9]. In PLT the delay is ~ 2 msec, 
while in Pulsator it is 0.2 msec, close to what we observe as the delay between sawteeth 
crashes  and  Ha   peak.  The  authors  have  investigated  the  possibility  of  ST  induced  de-
confinement of runaway electrons impinging on the limiter and thus periodically altering 
the HXR emission from the target. It is conceivable that this would also result in bursts of 
hydrogen and impurity release and that this accounts for the modulations seen in Ha  and 
CIII in our tokamak. But the HXR signal from the shots analyzed here does not show any 
ST modulations. In Aditya we have been able to observe such modulations in HXR signal 
(see fig 4) but only in shots, which are runaway dominated as inferred by the high level 
of HXR. The shots in the present campaign cannot be considered as runway discharges. 
So  we  shall  not  consider  the  possibility  further,  though  ST  instability  itself  generating 
runaways, which impinge on limiter (but any modulation in HXR being lower than our 
detection  limit)  cannot  at  present  be  ruled  out.  In  the  following  we  consider  our 
observations in light of sawteeth induced energy release  affecting the thermal electrons 
only.     
 
In the JET tokamak [4] the ST crashes, during which Te (0) drops from 3.4 to 3.0 keV, 
(D Te/Te ~ 15%) with a periodicity of 100 msec, correlate to Ha  peaks observed a few tens 
of millisecond later. The authors take this to be an indication of a heat pulse reaching the 
edge after a delay. In HT-7 tokamak [3] also ST (period ~ 5 msec, D Te/Te ~ 10%) leave 
their imprint on the Ha  signals. In this paper also authors explain it as the effect of heat 
pulse propagating to edge. They take it to mean that the Ha  signal is altered due to the

heat pulse impinging on the wall enhancing  the H atoms released from the surfaces. In 
other  words,  the  enhancement  in  edge  Ha   emissivity  is  attributed  to  increased  H  atom 
flux. In our tokamak, the temperature variation D Te in ST is nearly 50 eV and D Te/Te is 
quite  comparable  to  that  in  ohmically  heated  plasma  in  the  above  machines.  But  the 
periodicity  of  ST  (~  1  msec)  is  smaller.  We  believe  that  it  is  unlikely  that  the  energy 
released  and  then  spread  over  the  vessel  surface  area  would  significantly  affect  the  H 
atom  release.  Also  the  surface  thermal  time  constant  involved  would  tend  to  smear  out 
the release and destroy all coherence of Ha  with the ST bursts. 
 
We propose the following alternative mechanism to explain our observations. The arrival 
of the heat pulse (i.e. transient increase of electron temperature) at the edge momentarily 
alters  the  excitation  rate.  A  temperature  change  D Te  in  the  local  ambient  temperature 
about  20  eV  would  result  in  an  appreciable  change  in  emissivity  of  Ha ,  since  rate  of 
change  of  relative  excitation  coefficient  (1/Xe)*(dXe/dTe)  ~  0.03  eV-1  at  20  eV  [10]. In 
agreement  with  the  above,  ECE  signal  (presented  later)  from  the  edge,  which  is  a 
measure  of  temperature,  shows  33%  -  40%  modulations.  The  D Te  indicated  by  ECE 
measurement should result in relative intensity change in Ha  of 20%, while the observed 
modulation is about 15%. 
 
We are unable to observe ST related modulation in the line emissions of higher ionization 
species like OVIII, CV, NV from intermediate zones, at least not in the transitions that 
we use on Aditya to monitor these species. These are listed in Table 1. This is despite the 
fact that oscillation attributable to m = 2 mode rotations (and correlating well to Mirnov 
signals) are picked up routinely in these emissions (see fig. 5). This attests to the fact that 
the frequency response and S/N ratio of our detectors should have sufficed to record the 
sawteeth effects on the signals had they been present. It is estimated that for the weaker  

 

5

signal  like  OVII  a  modulation  of 
<10%,  and  even  smaller  modulation 
for  stronger  signals  like  NV,  would 
have  been  detected.  HT-7  group  [3] 
has  also  noted  the  absence  of  ST 
modulations  in  the  impurities  line 
emission.  On  the  other  hand,  other 
groups 
such 
modulations,  for  example,  in  OVII  at 
the core and CrI at the edge.

This can be understood as follows. In the central regions of tokamak plasma, a particular 
ionization  stage  of  specie  is  typically  present  in  a  shell  where  the  temperature  is  about 
one  half  the  ionization  potential  [13].  So  we  can  expect  that  the  emissivity  for  the 
particular  transitions  of  the  ion  will  be  affected  if  the  coefficient  of  excitation  to  the 
upper  level  of  this  transition  is  altered  significantly  by  the  change  in  temperature  D Te 
brought about by the heat pulse in the shell against the ambient temperature Te. For the 
lines used, we note that the electron impact rate coefficients for excitation from ground 
level to the upper level of transitions are near their peak. The excitation coefficient data 
for  CIV  are  shown  in  figure  6  for  illustration.  The  relative  variation  in  Xe  i.e. 
1/Xe*(dXe/dTe)*D Te  (see  table  1)  is  negligible  as  compared  to  that  for  Ha .  Even  for  a 
change of few tens of eV, the expected modulation would be hard to detect. 
 
We  conclude  that  the  electron  temperature  change  produced  by  the  propagating  heat 
pulse  generated  by  ST  crash  in  our  discharges  cannot  result  in  appreciable  change  the 
emissivities  of  the  lines  presently  monitored.  In  figure  6  we  have  also  shown  the 
excitation data for 1s23d(2D) level of CIV. Here, at the same shell temperatures of ~ 30 
eV, the excitation rate coefficient is still quite sensitive to temperature. Lines originating 
from  this  level,  for  example  384  Å  of  CIV,  would  probably  have  shown  ST  related 
modulations. Similar transitions exist for other species as well at shorter wavelengths. In 
Aditya,  a  bolometer  sensitive  to  all  VUV  wavelengths  10  Å  -  2000  Å  and  viewing  a 
central chord of the tokamak is available. The signal from the bolometer (see fig 7) does 

 

6

l
show modulations corresponding to the ST. However, the signature of individual rise and 
fall of sawteeth is not as well pronounced as in the case of individually resolved Ha  and 
CIII signals though the presence of the ST frequency component is apparent. This is not 
surprising considering that the bolometer signal is not only a composite of all VUV lines 
but also of such radiations emanating from different shells.

Fig. 9: Delay has been plotted against r and r2 
 
The available ECE emission data from the edge (r = 23 cm) as shown in figure 8a also 
clearly  show  the  ST  modulations.  The  delay  between  ST  crash  and  the  peak  of  ECE 
signal from different radial locations have been inferred by cross correlation analysis (fig 
8b). The fact that ECE modulations at different radii show different delays is of course 
indicative of the transport of a ST induced energy pulse. In figure 9, we show the delay t d 
as a function of r and r2, to seek whether the propagation is a ballistic (with a constant 
velocity) or a diffusive process. While the quality of linear fit to both is comparable, our 
data  indicates  a  very  rapid  transport  of  energy  from  the  core  to  edge  with  a  ballistic 
velocity of 783 m/sec. Even if the propagation is viewed as purely diffusive, the inverse 
of the slope, which is the measure of the diffusivity, has a large value of ~233 m2/sec.  
 
Conclusion: 
 
Sawtooth related modulation has been observed in the edge radiation of Aditya plasma. 
We have argued that the modulation in Ha  is due to change of excitation rate coefficient 
of transition upon the arrival of a heat pulse from the core. The specific lines emissions 
used  to  monitor  the  intermediate  ionizations  stages  of  impurities  do  not  exhibit  any 
modulation. This is also explained in terms of the relative insensitivity of their emission 
rate coefficients to small temperature changes during crash.  
The delay between a ST crash and an Ha  peak is very short and indicate an extremely fast 
propagation of the heat pulse generated during a sawtooth crash. The linear dependence 
of propagation delay time or distance suggests a ballistic component in the propagation.

Abstract. The Bubble regime of electron acceleration in ultra-relativistic laser
plasma is considered. It has been shown that the bubble can produce ultra-short dense
bunches of electrons with quasi-monoenergetic energy spectra. The ﬁrst experiment
in this regime done at LOA has conﬁrmed the peaked electron spectrum (J. Faure,
et al., submitted, 2004). The generated electron bunch may have density an order of
magnitude higher than that of the background plasma. The bubble is able to guide the
laser pulse over many Rayleigh lengths, thus no preformed plasma channel is needed
In the present work we
for high-energy particle acceleration in the bubble regime.
discuss a simple analytical model for the bubble ﬁelds as well as the scaling laws.

1. Introduction

The recent advance in laser technology oﬀers new possibilities for eﬃcient, compact
accelerators [1], advanced fusion concepts [2], and new generation of radiation sources
[3]. One of the promising schemes is the high-gradient laser wake ﬁeld acceleration
(LWFA) of charged particles in plasmas [5]. When a laser pulse propagates through
underdense plasma, it excites a running plasma wave oscillating with the frequency
ωp = (4πe2n0/γm)
, where e, m, and n0 denote charge, mass, and density of electrons,
respectively; γ is the electron relativistic factor. The wave trails the laser pulse with
p/2ω2), where ω
phase velocity set by the laser pulse group velocity vwake
is the laser frequency. A relativistic electron can ride this plasma wave, staying in-phase
with the longitudinal electric ﬁeld and be accelerated to high energies.

The laser pulse can excite the plasma wave in diﬀerent ways [4]. The excitation is
most eﬃcient when the laser pulse duration is of the order of the plasma wavelength
λp = 2πc/ωp. Taking a plane laser pulse with the normalized intensity proﬁle
0 cos2 πζ/2L for −L < ζ = z − ct < L, one ﬁnds that the wake ﬁeld reaches the
a2 = a2
maximum Emax/E0 = a2
0), when the laser pulse full width at half maximum
(FWHM) is L = λp/2 [5]. Here E0 = mcωp/e normalizes the electric ﬁeld of the plasma
wave, and a = eA0/mc2 is the normalized amplitude of the laser vector potential. The
pattern of wake ﬁeld excitation diﬀers signiﬁcantly for laser pulses longer and shorter
than the plasma period. The long laser pulse gets self-modulated with the plasma
period, and the resonance between this self-modulation and the plasma frequency leads
to eﬀective wake ﬁeld excitation. The corresponding regime is called self-modulated
laser wake ﬁeld acceleration (SM-LWFA) [6]. Long laser pulses, however, experience
not only the one-dimensional self-modulation, but get self-focused and form relativistic
channels in the plasma [7, 8].

Trapping of electrons in the plasma waves is a key issue for LWFA. Injection and
acceleration of external beams has been demonstrated experimentally [9]. Creation of
trapped electrons inside the wave bucket has been proposed with the application of
supplementary laser pulses [10, 11]. The wavebreaking can also lead to self-trapping
and acceleration of electrons by the plasma wave. It should be noted, however, that
the most experimentally observed spectra of accelerated electrons were exponentially
decaying [12, 13].

In the present paper, we focus on laser-plasma interaction in the “bubble” regime
recently proposed by A. Pukhov and J. Meyer-ter-Vehn [14]. It has been observed in 3D
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations for ultra-relativistically intense laser pulses shorter
than λp. These laser pulses are intense enough to break the plasma wave already after
the ﬁrst oscillation. The main features of the bubble regime are the following: (i) a
cavity free from cold plasma electrons is formed behind the laser pulse instead of a
periodic plasma wave; (ii) a dense bunch of relativistic electrons with a monoenergetic
spectrum is self-generated; (iii) the laser pulse propagates many Rayleigh lengths in the
homogeneous plasma without a signiﬁcant diﬀraction. These features are absent in the

ordinary regime of laser wake ﬁeld acceleration [5].

2. NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

For the simulations, we use the fully electromagnetic 3D PIC code Virtual Laser-Plasma
Laboratory [15]. The incident laser pulse is circularly polarized, has the Gaussian
envelope a(t, r) = A0 exp(−r2

L), and the wavelength λ = 0.82 µm.

L − t2/T 2

⊥/r2

In the ﬁrst simulation, the laser pulse parameters were rL = 10λ, cTL = 4λ, a0 = 10.
The vacuum Reyleigh length for these parameters is ZR ≈ 300λ. The pulse propagates
in a plasma with the density n0 = 6.1 × 10−3nc, where nc = (mω2/4πe2)
is the critical
density. The plasma density distribution observed in the simulation is shown in Fig. 1
at two instants of time: (a) when the laser pulse has passed l1
int = 25c/ωp ' 50λ and (b)
l2
int = 442c/ωp ' 900λ ' 3ZR in plasma. These density distributions are very typical for
the bubble regime. It is seen from Fig. 1 that the wake behind the laser pulse takes the
form of a solitary cavity, which is free from plasma electrons. The cavity is surrounded
by a high density sheath of the compressed electron ﬂuid. At later times, Fig. 1(b), a
beam of accelerated electrons grows from the bubble base. Simultaneously, the bubble
size increases.

The electron dynamics is deﬁned by the laser ponderomotive force and the
electromagnetic ﬁelds pertinent to the bubble density patterns. It is seen from Fig. 1
that there are roughly three patterns: (i) the electron plasma cavity with the large ion
charge; (ii) the electron sheath around the cavity forming the bubble boundary; (iii) the
bunch of accelerated electrons growing behind the laser pulse in the cavity. The density
of the electron sheath peaks at the head of the laser pulse and at the base of the cavity.
These density peaks are formed by the relativistic electrons with v ' v0. The bubble
base is the source of electrons, which get trapped and accelerated to γ À γ0, where
γ0 = (1 − v2
is the relativistic gamma-factor of the laser pulse.

3. FIELDS INSIDE RELATIVISTIC CAVITY

Here we develop a phenomenological theory of the bubble and approximate the electron
cavity by a sphere [17]. Before considering the relativistic cavity moving in plasma we
summarize the results for ﬁelds within an ionic sphere either at rest, or relativistically
moving. The electromagnetic ﬁeld of the uniformly charged sphere at rest is purely
electrostatic. The electric ﬁeld and the scalar potential inside the sphere with radius R
and with the charge density |e|n0 are [18]

where we choose that the potential is equal to unity at the sphere boundary. We use
dimensionless units, normalizing the time to ω−1
p , the lengths to c/ωp, the velocity to c,
the electromagnetic ﬁelds to mcωp/|e|, and the electron density, n, to the background
density n0.

simulation at the times when the laser pulse passed about (a) L1 = 25c/ωp ' 50λ and
(b) L2 = 442c/ωp ' 900λ. The coordinates are given in c/ωp.

If the ionic sphere runs with the relativistic velocity v0 ' 1 along x-axis then the

ﬁelds inside the sphere are

Ex = 0, Ey = Bz =

where the terms, which are proportional to γ−2
0 ¿ 1 , are neglected. The Lorentz
force on the relativistic electron moving inside the sphere with velocity vx = v = −1 is

0 = 1−v2

Fx = 0, Fy = −Ey − Bz = −y,
Fz = − Ez + By = −z,

while it is negligible in the limit v0 = vx = 1 because of relativistic compensation of the
electrostatic force by the self-magnetic force [19].

Now we are interested in the question what are the ﬁelds inside a spherical electron
cavity moving in plasma. This cavity is similar to the hole in semiconductor physics
[20]. Contrary to the case discussed above, the ions are now immobile in the cavity while
the cavity runs with the relativistic velocity v0 ' 1 along x-axis. The ion dynamics is
neglected because the cavity radius is assumed to be smaller than the ion response
length ' c/ωpi, where ωpi = (4πe2n0/M ) is the ion plasma frequency and M is the ion
mass. To calculate the ﬁelds we rewrite the Maxwell equations in terms of potentials
using the following convenient gauge

Ax = −ϕ.

Here we use the wake ﬁeld potential Φ = Ax − ϕ instead of the scalar one, n is the

Then we use a quasistatic approximation assuming that all quantities depend on

where R is the radius of the cavity, r2 = ξ2 + y2 + z2, and the constant of integration is
chosen so that Φ(R) = 1.

The electromagnetic ﬁelds inside the relativistic cavity are

Ex = ξ/2, Ey = −Bz = y/4,
Bx = 0 Ez = By = z/4.

The calculated distribution of electromagnetic ﬁelds is close to the one observed in the
3D PIC simulation (see Fig. 2). The small deviation from the analytically calculated
ﬁeld distribution is because the cavity shape is not exactly a sphere. It is easy to see
that the ﬁelds (14) satisfy the Maxwell equations.

The wake potential, Φ, can be considered as the potential of the Lorentz force on the
electron with vx = 1. The Lorentz force peaks for the electron with vx = v0 = 1 while
it is zero for the electron with vx = −1 because of the relativistic compensation of the
electrostatic force by the self-magnetic force. Notice that this eﬀect is opposite to that
of the relativistically moving ionic sphere. This is because the displacement current in
the cavity is opposite to the ion current in the relativistically moving ion sphere.

4. SCALABILITY OF THE BUBBLE

One of the most intriguing questions is the parameter region, where the bubble exists
and how the electron energy spectrum depends on the laser intensity and the plasma
density. Although there is a quite developed analytical theory for the weakly relativistic
regime, a ¿ 1, very little is known in the ultra-relativistic regime, a À 1. Yet, it is
the ultra-relativistic laser-plasma regime, where the bubble is formed. The analytical
diﬃculty here is that the electrons form multi-stream ﬂows, which must be described in
the fully kinetic way.

Here we show that in spite of the physics complexity, a very general and analytically
accurate scaling of the bubble can be derived. For this purpose we have to solve the
Vlasov equation on the electron distribution function f (t, r, p)

where F is an unknown universal function and R is the radius and τ is the duration
of the laser beam. Eq. (19) is of little use as long as it depends on four dimensionless
parameters. However, we are interested only in the ultrarelativistic limit. Thus, we can
set v = cp/ |p| and re-write the Vlasov equation as

Maxwell equations in the dimensionless form

Eqs. (21) contain the only one dimensionless parameter S = ne/a0nc and the unknown
universal function fS(t, p, r) = (m3
0/ne)f (t, p, r) Now we can express the electron
distribution function:

f =

(meca0)3 fS (t, p, r, R, τ, S) .

The universal function in Eq. (23) has no explicit dependence on n and a, but rather
depends on the dimensionless similarity parameter S only.

Thus, if we ﬁx the laser radius R and duration τ , and change simultaneously a0
and ne so that S = const, then the dynamics of the ultra-relativistic laser plasma scales
identically. This means that if we have found a bubble at some particular values of
laser pulse energy W0, amplitude a0 and n0, then we can scale it to larger or lower laser
intensities if we keep S = n/anc = const. In this scaling, the laser energy W changes as

We have compared this analytical scaling with direct 3D PIC simulations using the
code VLPL [15]. As the generating bubble we took a 30 fs laser pulse with W0 = 10 J
energy focused to the amplitude a0 = 10 propagating in plasma with n0 = 0.01nc
over 1000λ distance [14]. To upscale the bubble, we repeated the simulation with laser
pulses having the same shape, but with the amplitudes a1 = 20 (energy W1 = 40 J) and
a2 = 40 (energy W2 = 160 J) running in plasmas with n1 = 0.02nc and n2 = 0.04nc. The
electron energy spectra obtained after 1000λ propagation distance are shown in Fig. 3.
The obtained spectra satisfy the similarity (24)-(26). To transform one spectrum into
another, one may simply stretch them along the energy axis proportionally to the laser
amplitude a. At the same time, the number of energetic electrons scales as a.

Now, as soon as we are able to upscale the bubble, we may try to downscale it as
well. Although the downscaling would mean entering a moderately relativistic regime,
where the similarity theory is less reliable. The LOA experiment [21] has been done with
1 J energy, 30 fs laser pulse. According to the similarity theory (24)-(26) the plasma
density should be n ≈ 0.003nc and the monoenergetic peak should be expected at
≈ 170 MeV. The spectrum obtained in a 3D VLPL simulation for the LOA parameters
is shown in Fig. 4. We see that the electron energy is well scaled, but the number of

parameters

electrons is somewhat less than that expected from the similarity theory. Yet, in this
moderately relativistic regime even this scalability can be valuated as surprisingly good.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The ultra-relativistic laser-plasma bubble is a very promising regime of acceleration,
because it leads to quasi-monoenergetic electron beams. In the present work we derive
an analytical expression for the ﬁelds within a spherical cavity moving at relativistic
velocity in plasma. We show that the ﬁelds linearly depend on the coordiantes and act
to compress transversely the co-propagating electron beam.

We develop a similarity theory and show that the ultra-relativistic plasma has a
non-trivial similarity parameter S = n/anc. According to this parameter we check the
bubble scalability numerically.

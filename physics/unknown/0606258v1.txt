Abstract   We first briefly recall the basic mechanisms controlling the hydrodynamic and 

thermo-diffusive  stability  of  planar  laminar  premixed  flames,  and  give  the  state  of  the 

theoretical  analysis.  We  then  describe  some  novel  experiments  to  observe  and  measure  the 

growth rate of cellular structures on initially planar flames. The first experiment concerns the 

observation  of  the  temporal  growth  of  wrinkling  on  a  freely  propagating  planar  flame.  A 

second  experiment  concerns  the  spatio-temporal  growth  of  structures  of  controlled 

wavelength on an anchored flame. The experimental observations are compared to theoretical 

dispersion relation. Finally, we compare observations of the non-linear evolution to saturation 

with the predictions of an extended Michelson-Sivashinsky equation.  

Introduction 

 

In  general,  planar  flame  sheets  are  unstable  to  perturbations  and  will  spontaneously 

form cellular structures. Darrieus[1] in 1938 was the first to recognize that the gas expansion 

produced by heat release in a wrinkled premixed flame will deviate the flow lines in the front

towards  the  normal  to  the  flame.  Since  the  Mach  number,    M ≡ SL / c ,  (where  SL  is  the 

laminar flame speed and c is the speed of sound) of deflagrations is very small, the flow is 

quasi-incompressible.  Hence  the  upstream  flow  lines  are  also  deviated,  creating  flow 

divergence and velocity gradients that will increase the wrinkling of the flame (Fig. 1).

This  unconditional  hydrodynamic  instability  was  predicted  independently  by  Landau 

[2] in 1944. Considering the flame as a thin interface between unburned and burned gases, he 

found that the growth rate, σ, of this hydrodynamic instability should vary as

where k is the wavenumber of the perturbation and    E = ρu /ρb is the gas expansion ratio. A 

more complete description can be found in the work of Zeldovich et al.[3].  

If  the  finite  thickness  of  the  flame  front  is  considered,   δ= Dth SL ,  where  Dth  is  the 

thermal diffusivity,  then the effect of wrinkling will induce transverse heat and mass fluxes 

2 

that alter the local flame temperature and  lead to modifications of the local flame speed [3-5]. 

A  purely  one-dimensional  diffusive  instability  of  premixed  laminar  flames  (pulsating 

propagation), has been predicted [6, 7] for mixtures having a very high Lewis number coupled 

with  a  very  high  activation  energy.  However  the  theoretical  threshold  value  of  these 

parameters  is  beyond  the  range  of  real  flames  and  this  type  of  instability  has  never  been 

observed experimentally. 

 

The combined effects of preferential diffusion and hydrodynamic instability has been 

studied some twenty years ago by many authors [8-11].  The approximation of high activation 

energy and multi-scale asymptotics were used to solve the problem at three physically distinct 

scales, which are the inner scale of the chemical reaction zone (scale   δ/β), the scale of the 

diffusion  zone  (scale δ)  and  the  outer  scale  of  the  hydrodynamic  zone  (scale 

Here,  β≈ 10 is the reduced activation energy, or Zel’dovich number: 

  k −1).

The effect of gravity acting on two fluids of different density, burned and unburned gas, was 

also included on the analysis. The effect of gravity  can  help  stabilise  flames  when  the  light 

burned gas is above the heavy unburned gas. The most complete description of laminar flame 

stability is given in a little known 1983 paper of Clavin and Garcia [12]. These authors solve 

the  dynamics  of  small  amplitude  wrinkling  of  premixed  flames  including  the  effect  of 

temperature  dependent  diffusion  coefficients.  They  find  that  the  dispersion  relation  for  the 

growth rate, σ, of small amplitude wrinkling with wavenumber k is given by: 

    (στt )2 A(k ) + στt B(k ) + C(k ) = 0 

(3) 

The growth rate of the instability is given by the real part of σ. The wavenumber dependent 

 

 

coefficients in (3) are given by :

where      θ = (T − Tu ) /(Tb − Tu)  is  the  reduced  temperature,    h(θ)   is  the  thermal  diffusivity 

times density (  ρDth) at temperature θ, normalised by its value in the unburned gas, and   hb  is 

the value of     h(θ)  in the burned gas. The above relations were obtained in the linearised limit 

of long wavelength low frequency perturbations    k δ << 1,    στt << 1 with small amplitude of 

wrinkling. The expressions are accurate to order    (k δ)2 and   (στt )2. 

 

The sensitivity of the local burning velocity to curvature and stretch is contained in the 

Markstein number, Ma, [8]. When the Markstein number  is  positive, which is generally the 

case,  the  effect  of  curvature  is  to  decrease  the  burning  velocity  of  a  region  that  is  convex 

towards  the  unburned  gas,  implying  that  the  flame  is  thermo-diffusively  stable.  Clavin  and

In (6),  β is the reduced activation energy, or Zel’dovich number. The first term on the r.h.s. 

of  (6)  arises  from  transverse  convective  transport  of  heat  and  species  within  the  diffusive 

thickness of the wrinkled flame. The second term arises from transverse diffusive transport of 

heat  and  mass.  Equation  (6)  shows  that  when  convection  within  the  flame  thickness  is  also 

considered,  a  flame  can  be  thermo-diffusively  stable  (Ma  >  1)  even  for  Lewis  numbers 

smaller than unity. 

The approximation of one-step chemistry is not good and in general and (6) should be 

considered  only  as  a  rough  approximation.  It  is  generally  necessary  to  obtain  Markstein 

numbers from experimental measurements [13-16] or from direct numerical simulations [17, 

 

 

 

18]. 

Figure  2  shows  typical  plots  of  the  real  part  of  the  reduced  growth  rate, 

 στt , 

calculated as a function of the reduced wavenumber,   k δ,  for  propane  air  flames.  For  small 

wavenumbers, the growth rate first increases linearly with the wavenumber, as predicted by 

Darrieus and Landau. Then, at larger wavenumbers, the growth rate decreases with the square 

of  the  wavenumber,  due  to  thermo-diffusive  effects.  The  effect  of  gravity  is  to  shift  the 

growth rate curve downwards and to reduce the range of instable wavenumbers. The effect is 

only  significant  for  slow  flames,      SL < 0.2 m/s.  For  sufficient  slow  flames,      SL < 0.12 m/s, 

the effect of gravity can stabilise downwards propagating flames at all wavenumbers [11, 13].

This linear analysis is expected to be correct during the linear part of the growth of the 

Darrieus-Landau  instability.  However,  until  recently,  there  has  been  no  direct  experimental 

verification  of  the  theory.  The  reason  for  this  lies  in  the  difficulty  of  producing  the  initial 

condition  of  a  planar,  freely  propagating,  unstable  flame.  The  characteristic  growth  time  of 

the instability is typically 20-50 ms, which is short compared to the time needed to establish a 

freely propagating flame of finite dimensions. It follows that the Darrieus-Landau instability 

has nearly always been observed in the phase of non-linear saturation. 

Experimental Verification on Planar Flames 

 

The first direct experimental verification of (2) was performed by Clanet and Searby 

[20].  They  used  a  novel  technique  of  acoustic  restabilisation  to  produce  a  perfectly  planar 

laminar  flame  that  is  otherwise  intrinsically  unstable.  The  imposed  acoustic  field  was  then 

removed on a short time scale, (about 1 ms), and the unconstrained growth of the Darrieus-

Landau instability was observed. The contents of this section will describe their work.

Effect of Acoustic Field on a Laminar Flame 

The  effect  of  an  imposed  acoustic  field  on  a  freely  propagating  premixed  laminar 

flame  front  has  been  given  by  Searbyand  Rochwerger  [21].  In  the  approximation      a k << 1, 

where a is the amplitude of the wrinkling, these authors have shown that the dynamics of a 

flame front in an imposed acoustic field characterised by the frequency,   ωa, and displacement 

velocity,    ua,  is  dominated  by  the  effect  of  the  periodic  acoustic  acceleration  acting  on  the 

flame seen as a thin interface between two fluids of different density. The dynamics of this 

system can be obtained from (3) and (4) by introducing this periodic acoustic acceleration into 

the Froude number, along with the acceleration of gravity: 

Fr−1 =
    

g δ

SL

− ωa ua cos(ωa t ) 

(7) 

Writing     α( y, t ) = a exp(σt − i k y), where α is the amplitude of wrinkling at wavenumber 

k,  it  can  be  seen  that  (3)  is  the  time  Fourier  transform  of  the  following  equation  of  motion 

for α: 

∂2α
∂t 2

[

]α = 0  

(8) 

Where  the  wavenumber  dependent  coefficients  A(k),  B(k)  and  C(k)  are  given  in  (4).  The 

acoustic acceleration has introduced an extra term    C1(k ) : 

C1(k ) =

Equation (8) is formally equivalent to a parametrically driven damped harmonic oscillator in 

which  the  acoustic  acceleration  appears  as  the  driving  force.  This  equation,  (8),  can  be 

reduced to the Mathieu equation [22] by a simple substitution of variables [8]. The solutions 

7 

of this latter are known to present regions of instability separated by a stable domain, Details 

are given in [21].

Figure 3. Regions of stability and instability of lean premixed propane flame subjected to a 

periodic acoustic acceleration.  

 

It  may  be  noted  that  the  flame  front  does  not  have  a  single  characteristic  frequency, 

but  a  continuum  associated  with  the  continuum  of  wavelengths  that  can  be  excited  on  its 

surface.  In  Fig. (3),  we  have  plotted  a  typical  stability  diagram  for  the  solutions  to  equ (8), 

using parameters appropriate for a lean propane-air flame. The stability thresholds are plotted 

as  a  function  of  reduced  wavenumber  for  the  reduced  frequency   ωτt  = 0.88.  The  lower 

pocket  of  instability,  at  small  wavenumber  and  low  acoustic  amplitudes  corresponds  to  the 

Darrieus-Landau  instability  including  thermo-diffusive  effects.  A  remarkable  feature  is  that 

the  limits  of  this  unstable  domain  moves  towards  each  other  as  the  acoustic  amplitude  is 

increased from zero. For an acoustic amplitude    ua / SL ≈ 3, the upper and lower wavelength 

limits  of  this  unstable  zone  merge,  and  the  planar  flame  front  is  restabilised  at  all 

wavenumbers with respect to the hydrodynamic instability. At higher acoustic levels, there is 

a  second  domain  of  instability.  In  this  domain,  the  flame  structures  oscillate  at  half  the 

acoustic frequency; it is the domain of parametric instability. The fact that a finite value of 

excitation is needed to excite this instability is related to the presence of a damping term in 

8 

equ.(8).  The  lower  threshold  of  this  unstable  domain  is  a  function  of  the  reduced  acoustic 

frequency. As the reduced frequency is decreased (or equivalently, as the laminar flame speed 

is  increased),  the  lower  threshold  moves  downwards  and  will  overlap  the  lower  instability 

domain. However, for excitation frequencies of a few hundred Hertz and for moderate flames 

speeds  less  than  0.2 m/s,  the  flame  can  be  stable  at  all  wavelengths  for  a  small  range  of 

acoustic excitations having acoustic displacement velocities    ua ≈ 3.5 SL. This corresponds to 

an acoustic intensity of about 140 dB. See reference [21]. This acoustic stabilisation window 

has been used to maintain an intrinsically unstable flame in a planar state, prior to observing 

the growth of the Darrieus-Landau instability. 

Experimental Set-up for Acoustically Stabilised Flame 

 

 

       

 

Figure 4. Experimental set up used to prepare an acoustically stabilised planar premixed 

flame and photograph of an acoustically stabilised flame. 

 

The  experimental  apparatus  is  shown  in  Fig. 4.  The  premixed  gases  are  fed  into  the 

bottom of a Pyrex glass tube 100 mm diameter and 400 mm long, just below a 50µm porous 

plate whose role was to laminarise the flow. The flame was held stationary in the laboratory 

frame, about 50 mm below the tube exit, by careful adjustment of the gas flow rate. A 2 mm 

9 

aluminium honeycomb structure 40 mm long was placed a few centimetres upstream from the 

flame  to  help  maintain  a  laminar  and  homogeneous  gas  flow.  A  helical  cooling  tube  was 

wound  round  the  outside  of  the  Pyrex  tube,  below  the  flame  front,  in  order  to  prevent  wall 

heating  by  heat  conduction  and  radiation  from  the  flame.  The  Pyrex  tube  was  closed  at  its 

lower  extremity  by  a  loudspeaker,  which  was  fed  from  a  micro-computer  used  as  a 

programmable signal generator. The acoustic impedance of the porous plate is high and the 

Pyrex  tube  behaved  as  an  open-closed  resonator.  It  was  excited  in  the  1/4  wavelength 

longitudinal  mode  (230 Hz).  The  natural  acoustic  damping  time  (≈12 ms)  was  not  always 

short  compared  to  the  growth  time  of  the  Darrieus-Landau  instability.  To  overcome  this 

limitation,  at  the  start  of  a  measurement,  the  damping  of  the  acoustic  standing  wave  was 

increased artificially by injecting one cycle of a signal in phase opposition with the pressure 

in the tube. An intensified high-speed cine camera recorded the luminous emission from the 

flame. 

 

Experiments were performed with lean propane-air mixtures with equivalence ratios in 

the range 0.56 ≤ Φ ≤ 0.67, corresponding to burning velocities in the range 0.11 m/s ≤ SL ≤ 

0.20 m/s.  For  leaner  flames,  the  front  was  intrinsically  stable  at  all  wavelengths.  For  faster 

flames,  a  flat  laminar  flame  could  not  be  obtained  by  this  method.  In  order  to  control  the 

wavelength  and  orientation  of  the  cellular  structures  that  developed  when  the  acoustic 

stabilisation was removed, the upstream gas flow was slightly perturbed by placing an array 

of parallel wires, 2 mm in diameter, on the downstream face of the honeycomb. The object of 

this scheme was to excite purely 2-D cells at a chosen wavelength of 2 cm, close to the most 

unstable wavelength, see Fig.2. The luminous emission from the flame front was filmed edge-

on  in  a  direction  parallel  to  the  axis  of  the  cells.  Fig.5  shows  a  sequence  of  typical  images 

taken from a high speed film during the growth of the Darrieus-Landau instability. The time 

t = 0 corresponds to the instant at which the acoustic field was removed.

The  apparent  thickening  of  the  flame,  particularly  at  high  cell  aspect  ratios  indicates  the 

presence  of  slight  three-dimensionality  of  the  wrinkling.  The  peak  to  peak  amplitude  of  the 

wrinkling was measured on digitized images and plotted in semi-log coordinates as shown in

The large scatter of the points in the early stages of the growth arise from the small amplitude 

of  the  cells,  of  the  order  of  the  apparent  flame  thickness.  The  non-linearity  at  long  times

indicates the onset of saturation of the instability. This nonlinearity of the shape of the cells is 

clearly visible in Fig.5 after 140 ms. These points were systematically eliminated before data 

reduction to obtain the growth rate. The points were fitted to an exponential function of the

Experimental Verification of Growth Rate on Inclined Flames 

 

In  the  previous  section  we  have  described  an  experimental  technique  that  has  been 

used  to  observe  the  temporal  growth  rate  of  the  Darrieus-Landau  instability  on  an  initially 

planar flame. Because of limitations inherent to the technique, the observations were limited 

to relatively slow flames, SL < 0.2 mm/s and to observation at a wavelength close to that of 

maximum  growth  rate.  In  this  section  we  will  describe  a  different  experimental  technique 

used  by  Truffaut  and  Searby  [24,  25]  to  measure  the  growth  rate  of  the  instability  on  an 

inclined flame over a wider range of wavenumbers and flame speeds. 

 

In these experiments a small amplitude oscillation, at frequency f, was imposed at base 

of the inclined flame and the resulting structure was convected downstream by the tangential 

component of the gas flow. The wavelength of the structure is    λ = u// / f  where     u//  is the 

tangential  convection  velocity.  In  this  configuration  the  growth  of  the  instability  is  spatio-

temporal  and  not  simply  temporal.  The  spatial  growth  rates  were  converted  to  temporal 

growth rates using a Lagrangian time obtained from the displacement velocity of the wrinkles, 

    u// . This conversion is expected to be valid if adjacent cells have (nearly) the same size. This 

condition is satisfied when the growth time is long compared to the time taken to convect the 

pattern a distance of one wavelength downstream, i.e. for    ℜ[σ−1] >> f −1. Thus (3)-(5) were 

again used to analyse the results of the experimental measurements. 

 

Equations  (3)-(5)  are  strictly  valid  only  for  planar  flames  propagating  upwards  or 

downwards. The case of an inclined flame in a gravity field has been treated theoretically by 

Garcia and Borghi [26]. The effect of gravity is to introduce a bulk force with a component 

parallel  to  the  flame  front  and  the  problem  becomes  asymmetric.  In  a  simplified  analysis, 

13 

Garcia and Borghi found that 2-D wrinkles, whose axes of wrinkling are horizontal, can have 

a  finite  propagation  velocity,  different  from  the  convective  velocity.  According  to  their 

analysis, this propagation velocity goes to zero for horizontal and for vertical flame fronts. In 

the  experiments  of  Searby  and  Truffaut,  the  flame  fronts  are  close  to  vertical  (<  5°)  and 

moreover the Froude number of the flames,    Fr = SL

2 /(g δ) was always very large (Fr > 90). 

The effect of gravity is then expected to be negligible. Experimentally, it was found that the 

measured  displacement  velocity  of  the  wrinkles  was  always  equal  to  the  velocity  of  the 

tangential gas flow.

The experimental apparatus is shown schematically in Fig.8. The premixed propane-

air-oxygen  gas  was  fed  to  the  bottom  of  a  burner  designed  to  produce  a  laminar  “top-hat” 

velocity  profile  at  the  exit.  The  burner  comprised  a  divergent  section,  a  settling  chamber,  a 

14 

convergent  section  and  a  nozzle.  The  60 mm  high  divergent  section  was  filled  with  4 mm 

diameter  glass  beads  to  break  up  the  incoming  flow.  The  flow  was  then  laminarised  in  a 

140 mm  square  settling  chamber  containing  an  aluminium  honeycomb,  followed  by  three 

metal grids of decreasing mesh size. Finally a 2-D convergent section, with a contraction ratio 

of 30:1, accelerated the flow up to the 8x80 mm exit section and reduced the residual velocity 

fluctuations  to  a  small  fraction  of  the  mean  flow  velocity.  The  1:10  aspect  ratio  of  the  exit 

provided  a  2-D  inverted-‘V’  flame.  End  effects  perturbed  the  flame  for  less  than  10 mm  at 

each extremity. The thickness of the viscous boundary layers was less than 1.5 mm and the 

transverse velocity profiles were flat to better than 1 % over the central region of 5 mm. The 

residual turbulence was less than 0.5 %. In order  to  minimise  the  development  of  a  thermal 

boundary layer near the walls, both the convergent section and nozzle were water-cooled at 

the temperature of the unburnt mixture (20°C).

oxygen flame, equivalence ratio = 1.33, 28 % oxygen, flow velocity 8.56 m/s, excitation 

frequency 2100 Hz. 

 

One  side  of  the  flame  was  anchored  on  a  thin  tungsten  rod,  0.6 mm  diameter,  placed  just 

above and parallel to the burner exit, see Fig.9. The laminar flame was perturbed on one face 

by  applying  an  alternating  high  voltage  between  the  rod  and  the  burner  exit.  The  resulting 

electric field displaces the flame locally and produced a periodic sinusoidal 2-D wrinkle on 

the flame front as shown in Figs.8 and 9. The axis of the wrinkle was parallel to the burner 

slot. The wrinkle was convected downstream by the gas flow and its amplitude was observed 

15 

to increase exponentially. This system permitted a precise control of both the initial amplitude 

and of the wavelength of the wrinkle through control of the amplitude and of the frequency of 

the  applied  signal.  Typical  ranges  of  voltage  and  frequency  were  2-4 kV  and  1-4 kHz 

respectively. 

 

A similar electrostatic technique was first used by Polanyi and Markstein in 1947 [27]. 

However  the  present  system  is  slightly  different,  in  that  Markstein  placed  a  deflection 

electrode  in  the  burned  gas,  whereas  we  used  the  electrode  as  a  flame  holder.  We  have 

observed  that,  for  a  given  voltage,  the  amplitude  of  small  wavelength  wrinkles  was  much 

greater when the flame was excited via a flame-holder, probably because the electric field acts 

more locally on the flame front. The deflection of a flame in an electric field is attributed to a 

body force produced by momentum transfer between charged particles and neutral molecules. 

Some  authors  [28,  29]  have  argued  that  the  momentum  transfer  from  heavy  ions  dominates 

momentum transfer from electrons, giving rise to a non-zero body force in the direction of the 

electric field. 

 

Experiments  were  performed  on  rich  propane-air  flames  and  propane-air-oxygen 

flames with equivalence ratios in the range 1.05 ≤ Φ ≤ 1.33. The corresponding laminar flame 

velocities  were  in  the  range  0.43 m/s  ≥  SL  ≥  0.27 m/s  [23]  for  the  propane-air  flames.  The 

velocities were 0.69 m/s and 0.51 m/s for flames with 28 % oxygen at equivalence ratios of 

1.05 and 1.33. The gas flow velocities were 7.4 m/s, 6.05 m/s and 8.56 m/s. 

 

Data Acquisition 

The  wrinkled  flame  front  was  observed  using  a  short  exposure  intensified  CCD  camera, 

viewing parallel to the long edge of the burner slot. In this configuration the flame is a long 

3–D  object.  Since  we  were  interested  in  imaging  a  cross  section  of  the  flame,  we  used  an 

optical system having a short depth of focus and a high magnification ratio. The camera was 

16 

focussed in the centre of the burner slot and the depth of focus was roughly 2 mm. This value 

also  represented  the  uncertainty  in  the  knowledge  of  the  position  of  the  object  plane.  The 

resulting  relative  uncertainty  in  the  magnification  of  the  image  is  less  than  1 %.  An 

inconvenient of this optical system is some unsharpness of the image due to the superposition 

of  the  out-of-focus  contours  from  other  distances.  However  the  resolution  of  the  images 

obtained by this method was acceptable, see Fig.9. 

 

The  video  camera  was  triggered  at  a  frequency  close  to  50  Hz  by  a  pulse  generator 

synchronized  to  an  appropriate  sub-harmonic  of  the  excitation  signal.  An  adjustable  delay 

allowed us to take images at different phases of the excitation. For all images, the gate-time of 

the intensifier was less than 100 µs and the optical gain was adjusted manually so as to obtain 

non-saturated  images.  The  images  were  digitized  at  a  resolution  of  760*570  pixels.  The 

spatial  calibration,  obtained  by  imaging  a  grid  placed  in  the  object  plane,  was  52.6 µm  per 

pixel. 

 

In  the  experiment  described  here,  the  flame  front  was  not  freely  propagating,  but 

attached  to  a  flame  holder  in  the  proximity  of  a  companion  front,  forming  an  inverted-‘V’ 

flame.  In  this  situation,  care  must  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  observed  perturbations  were 

growing  freely.  Firstly  it  was  ensured  that  residual  and  external  flow  perturbations  were  so 

small  that  only  the  imposed  wavelength  appears  on  the  flame  front.  This  was  verified  by 

noticing that, in the absence of electric excitation there was no detectable motion of the flame 

front.  The  residual  perturbations  were  so  small  that  they  did  not  have  time  to  grow  to 

measurable amplitude before they were convected to the flame tip. Secondly it was ensured 

that the two flame fronts did not interact. It is known that the hydrodynamic field ahead of a 

wrinkled premixed flame is modified over a characteristic distance equal to     k −1 [30]. If the 

distance between the two fronts is smaller than this value, the instability developing on one 

side of the flame can be influenced by the presence of the other flame. To avoid this problem 

17 

the angle between the two sides of the flame was kept small and their spacing, in the field of 

visualization,  was  kept  large  compared  to    k −1.  For  this  reason  the  measurements  were  also 

restricted to wavelengths less than 6 mm. The absence of interaction between the two flame 

fronts  can  be  checked  from  images  such  as  Fig.9.  The  lower  side  of  the  flame  shows  no 

perturbation  from  the  wrinkled  side  of  the  flame,  except  at  the  far  right  side  of  the  image, 

close  to  the  flame  tip,  where  the  amplitude  of  the  wrinkling  is  already  saturated.  It  may  be 

concluded that the contrary is also true, the wrinkled side of the flame was not affected by the 

presence of the unperturbed side.

Figure 10. Plot of flame profile from Fig.9 showing method of measuring amplitude of 

wrinkling and corresponding peak-to-peak amplitude. 

Images of the flame, such the one shown in Fig.9, were processed to obtain the amplitude and 

the wavelength of the wrinkles as a function of the distance downstream. A program searched 

for the brightest pixel on each vertical line of pixels in a sub-window containing the excited 

side of the flame. The program then fitted a parabola through the intensity at this point and at 

two other points on each side of the maximum. The flame position was given by the position 

of the maximum of the fitted curve. This algorithm gave the position of the flame front as a 

function of the distance from the flame holder. A typical plot is shown in Fig.10.  

18 

 

Figure 11. Semi-log plot of peak-to-peak amplitude of flame wrinkling obtained from 

Fig.10.  

After  low  pass  filtering  of  the  curve  the  maxima  and  minima  were  located.  The  value 

corresponding  to  excitation  in  phase  opposition  was  approximated  by  interpolation  of  the 

preceding and following minima (or maxima), as shown in Fig.10. In this way, the peak-to-

peak amplitude and the wavelength of the wrinkle were obtained for each extremum position. 

For  each  frequency  of  excitation  this  operation  was  repeated  for  4  different  phases  of  the 

signal.  The  peak-to-peak  amplitude  was  then  plotted  in  semi-log  coordinates,  as  shown  in 

Fig.11.  

The spatial growth rate of the instability, σ, was obtained by fitting this curve 

with an exponential function. The initial points, close to the flame holder, were influenced by 

the  presence  of  the  rod  and  also  by  the  presence  of  the  electric  field.  The  amplitude  of  the 

wrinkle  in  this  region  was  of  the  order  of  the  apparent  flame  thickness δ ≈  0.2 mm.  These 

points  were  systematically  ignored,  along  with  the  downstream  points  in  the  region  of 

saturation where the wrinkles are cusped. The amplitude of the wrinkling was measured with 

a precision of the order of δ ≈ 0.2 mm, so there was a resulting uncertainty in the values of the 

fitted  parameters.  The  spatial  growth  rate  was  thus  measured  with  a  precision  that  ranged 

from 10 % to 30 %, depending on the size of the wrinkles. 

19 

Results 

  

 

The experimental results showed that the wrinkles produced at the base of the flame 

were convected downstream at a constant velocity,    u// , equal to the tangential flow velocity 

to within experimental error. The wavelength of excitation is thus given by     λ= u// / f where 

f is the excitation frequency. We have not observed any tendency for the wrinkles to have a 

finite propagation velocity with respect to the flow, as suggested in the work of Garcia and 

Borghi [26]. The amplitude of the wrinkles was observed to increase exponentially up to the 

onset of saturation, visible in Figs 9, 10 and 11. 

 

Figure 12 Measured growth rate of Darrieus-Landau instability as a function of imposed 

wavenumber for propane-air flames at four different equivalence ratios. The curves are 

calculated from (3). 

 

The spatial growth rate was converted to a  temporal  growth  rate  from  knowledge  of 

the convection velocity of the structures,    σ = σx u// . The non-dimensional temporal growth 

20 

rates  were  plotted  as  a  function  of  the  non-dimensional  wavenumber  in  Fig. 12.  The 

dimensional  growth  rate  was  typically  150-300 s-1  for  propane  air  flames.  The  minimum 

value of     f / σ was 3. Similar plots for the oxygen-enriched flames are shown in Fig.13.

Figure 13. Measured growth rate of Darrieus-Landau instability as a function of imposed 

wavenumber for propane flames with 28 % oxygen at two different equivalence ratios. The 

curves are calculated from (3). 

 

These  experimental  results  are  compared  to  the  theoretical  dispersion  relation  (3)  of 

Clavin  and  Garcia  [12]  where  the  acceleration  of  gravity  been  put  equal  to  zero.  This 

approximation is justified because the Froude number, based on the flame speed and gravity, 

is always greater than 90 in these experiments. The numerical data used for the calculations is 

listed in table 1. 

 

The Markstein number of each flame has been treated as an unknown parameter. For 

each  flame  we  have  plotted  the  theoretical  curve  for  the  Markstein  number  that  agrees  best 

with the measured results. To give an idea of the variation of the theoretical curves with this 

parameter, we have also plotted curves for the best values of Ma ± 0.3 or ± 0.2 according to 

sensitivity. It can be seen that the theoretical curve and the experimental measurements agree 

to  within  experimental  uncertainty.  It  can  also  be  seen  that,  for  large  wavenumbers,  the 

measured  growth  rate  of  the  instability  decreases  with  increasing  wavenumber,  as  predicted 

21 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  theory  including  the  effects  of  both  hydrodynamics  and  preferential  diffusion.  These 

experimental values of the Markstein number are comparable with other values given in the 

literature for rich propane-air flames [14, 31].

Table 1. Numerical values used to calculate the curves in Figs.12 and 13 

These experiments were limited to wave lengths less than 6 mm to avoid interaction 

between  the  two  flame  fronts.  This  constraint  imposed  a  lower  limit  on  the  reduced 

wavenumber, k δ, which was thus limited to the range 0.04−0.15. This value is smaller than 

unity, but not very much smaller, so the results are at the limit of the domain of validity of 

linearised asymptotic flame theory (k δ << 1). It may also be noted that the maximum reduced 

growth rate,   σt , is 0.1 for the richest propane-air flame. The results are thus also at the limit 

of validity low of the low frequency assumption. 

Nonlinear saturation of the instability 

 

In  the  previous  sections  we  have  been  concerned  with  the  small  amplitude  linear 

growth rate of the instability. It was seen that the growth rate is well described by linearised 

asymptotic  laminar  flame  theory.  In  this  section  we  will  be  concerned  with  the  nonlinear 

effects leading to the saturation of the amplitude of the structures, see Figs 9 and 11. 

22 

 

The origin of the saturation mechanism is easily understood qualitatively. Consider a 

wrinkled flame, flat on average, propagating into a quiescent fresh mixture. At all points, the 

flame propagates in the direction of the local normal to the flame front. When the aspect ratio 

of the structures formed by the instability is not small, the local direction of propagation of 

the flame front is significantly different from the average plane of the flame. It is easy to see 

that  an  initially  sinusoidal  structure  will  distort.  The  radius  of  curvature  of  zones  that  are 

convex  towards  the  unburned  gas  will  increase,  whereas  the  radius  of  curvature  of  concave 

zones will decrease until a cusp is formed. 

 

A  simple  model  equation  for  the  evolution  of  the  flame  shape,  including  this 

geometrical  nonlinearity  leading  to  amplitude  saturation,  has  been  proposed  by  Sivashinsky 

[9,  32]  in  the  limit  of  small  gas  expansion  (E−1 << 1).  This  equation,  known  as  the 

Michelson-Sivashinsky equation, for the time evolution of the wrinkled flame, can be written 

in a simplified dimensional form:

where     α( x, t )  is the local position of the wrinkled front with respect to some reference plane, 

x  is  the  transverse  coordinate  and  kn  is  the  neutral  wavenumber  for  which  the  growth  rate 

    σ(k )  is  zero.  The  linear  operator 

  I (α, x)   multiplies  α  by  |k|  in  wavenumber  space.  It 

corresponds to the Darrieus-Landau instability. 

I (eikx, x) = k eikx 
  

(12) 

 The  second  derivative,      (∂2α/ ∂x2 ),  describes  the  change  in  local  burning  velocity  with 

curvature  and  stretch  [8,  33].  The  nonlinear  x-dependant  term, 

  (∂α/ ∂x)2,  arises  from 

inclination of the flame front and together with the curvature term,    (∂2α/ ∂x2 ), will lead to 
23 

saturation. Equation (11) was obtained in the limit of Lewis number close to unity, and small 

gas  expansion  ratio,  E−1 << 1.  The  acceleration  of  gravity  is  not  considered  here.  In  real 

flames the gas expansion ratio is not a small parameter, typically E ≈  6. Using the analytical 

results  obtained  by  Boury  [34,  35],  Searby,  Truffaut  and  Joulin  [25]  have  argued  that  the 

following extension to the Michelson-Sivashinsky equation is a better model equation for the 

evolution of wrinkled flames when the gas expansion is not small compared to unity:

The function   B → ∞ for  τ → −∞ .  Admittedly (15-16) is not the most general known exact 

solution  to  (14)  (see  Refs.  [36,  37]),  but  it  is  the  only  relevant  one  if  kn/3  <  K  ≤  kn  when 

starting from an infinitesimal 2π/K-periodic pattern [38].  At fixed x, the above solution for 

  α(χ,τ)  oscillates in time with a pulsation    ω = u// K .  This yields K if    u//  and ω are known.  

The  local  maxima  and  minima  of    α(χ,τ)   occur  when  cos(K(χ − χo)) = ± 1.    The  peak  to

The  result  of  the  calculation  is  shown  in  Fig.14,  along  with  the  experimental  points 

taken  from  Fig.11.  The  only  adjustable  parameter  in  this  plot  is  the  initial  amplitude  of 

wrinkling.  All  the  other  parameters  are  predetermined.  It  is  not  really  surprising  that  the 

exponential  part  of  the  growth  is  well  represented,  this  just  means  that,  to  order  k2,  the 

Michelson-Sivashinsky  equation (14)  has  the  same  dispersion  relation  as  the  Clavin-Garcia 

equation  (3-4).  It  is  however  remarkable  that  the  Michelson-Sivashinsky  equation  also 

correctly predicts both the saturation amplitude of the structures and the width of the cross-

over region between exponential growth and constant saturated amplitude. 

 

The complete non-linear flame profile is given by (15-16). We have used this equation 

to calculate the curve shown in Fig.16. We have used the same input data as in Fig.15. Extra 

experimental parameters are the initial flame position and the initial phase of wrinkling. The 

excitation  frequency  is  2100 Hz.  As  expected  from  Fig.15,  equation  (15-16)  gives  a  good 

overall prediction of the growth of the instability. It also gives a good representation of the 

26 

form  of  the  wrinkling,  evolving  from  a  sinusoidal  to  a  cusped  shape.  The  precision  of  the 

measurements of the flame profile from Fig.9 is insufficient to make any direct comparison 

concerning the radius of curvature of the cusps.

in Fig.15. 

However it is clear from the comparison of the observed and calculated flame profiles 

in Fig15, that the flame front accelerates towards the burnt gas as the wrinkling increases, and 

the amplitude of this acceleration is strongly underestimated by (15), in which the increase in 

average flame speed arises solely from the increase in the arclength of the front, given by:

The  origin  of  this  strong  increase  in  apparent  overall  flame  propagation  speed  is  the 

production  of  a  large-scale  flow  circulation  induced  by  the  increased  average  propagation 

velocity along the flame. This x-dependant increase in the average flame speed creates an x-

dependant  increase  in  the  pressure  jump  across  the  flame  brush,  which  in  turn  bends  the 

overall hydrodynamic flow.  

27 

 

We may finally remark that this transverse circulation, will make the other, unexcited, 

side of our two-dimensional Bunsen flame acquire a time-averaged deflection from its straight 

unperturbed shape. This is indeed the case, as can be seen in Fig.5. The unexcited side of the 

flame is curved away from the unburned gas, and this curvature increases towards the flame 

tip.  Accordingly,  measuring  the  instantaneous  distance  between  the  two  flame  fronts,  then 

subtracting  the  unperturbed  value  should  give  access  to  a  comparison  of  theory  and 

experiments  that  is  unaffected  by  the  global  transverse  circulation.  This  has  been  done  in 

Fig.17.

correction for the large-scale transverse flow. 

 

This treatment noticeably improves the agreement compared to Fig.16. Experimentally 

the last cell is still more developed than predicted. However, considering the small distance 

between  the  two  opposed  flame  fronts  at  this  location, this difference can be attributed to a 

small-scale hydrodynamic interaction between the two flame fronts. In Fig.5, the development 

of a cell at the far end of the unexcited flame front is indeed a sign of such an interaction. 

Conclusion 

 

We have recalled the mechanisms controlling the stability of planar laminar premixed 

flames, along with a brief historical survey of the theoretical approaches used to model them 

28 

analytically. Despite the fact that the intrinsic instability of planar flames has been recognised 

for  nearly  a  century  and  that  the  first  attempts  at  an  analytical  description  were  performed 

over  fifty  years  ago,  experimental  validation  of  the  predicted  growth  rates  of  unstable 

structures has been obtained only recently. The main reason for this lies in the experimental 

difficulty  of  preparing  and  controlling  an  initially  planar  premixed  flame  front  in  a  regime 

where the planar front is unstable. 

 

We  have  described  two  novel  experiments  in  which  the  growth  rate  of  cellular 

structures  on  planar  flames  has  been  measured  directly.  In  the  first  experiment  an  unstable 

laminar flame front is maintained initially planar by the action of an imposed acoustic field. 

The temporal growth rate of 2-D wrinkling is then observed after removal of the stabilising 

acoustic field. In the second experiment the spatio-temporal growth of wrinkling is observed 

on an inclined anchored flame. The residual turbulence of the gas flow is sufficiently low that 

turbulence  induced  perturbations  at  the  base  of  the  flame  are  not  amplified  to  a  perceptible 

amplitude  before  reaching  the  tip  of  the  flame.  Perturbations  of  controlled  wavelength  and 

amplitude are then created by an electrostatic deflection system. This technique has permitted 

the exploration of a significant portion of the dispersion curve. The spatial growth rate of the 

wrinkling  was  converted  to  a  temporal  growth  rate  using  a  Lagrangian  time.  These 

experimental observations have confirmed the validity of the analytical theory. 

 

In the final section of this paper we have investigated the non-linear saturation of the 

instability.  Our  experimental  observations  have  been  compared  to  the  predictions  of  a 

Michelson-Sivashinsky equation, extended to the case of strong gas expansion and adapted to 

include tangential convective flow. It was seen that the extended equation correctly describes 

both the amplitude of structures at saturation and also the transition region from exponential 

growth to saturation. The experimental observations show a strong apparent overall increase 

in velocity of the wrinkled flame front. The origin of this effect is attributed to the generation 

29 

of a large-scale hydrodynamic flow, induced by the x-dependence of the pressure jump across 

the  wrinkled  flame.  This  effect  is  absent  from  the  Michelson-Sivashinsky  description.

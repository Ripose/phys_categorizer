Abstract
      The SNS SRF system is  operated with a pulsed beam.
For  the  SRF  system  to  track  the  repetitive  reference
trajectory,  a  feedback  and  a  feedforward  controllers  has
been  proposed.    The  feedback  controller  is  to  guarantee
the  closed  loop  system  stability  and  the  feedforward
controller  is  to  improve  the  tracking  performance  for  the
repetitive  reference 
the
repetitive disturbance.  As the iteration number increases,
the error decreases.

1  INTRODUCTION

The  Spallation  Neutron  Source  (SNS)  Linac  to  be
built  at  Oak  Ridge  National  Laboratory  (ORNL)  consists
of  a  combination  of  low  energy  normal  conducting  (NC)
accelerating  structures  as  well  as  higher  energy
superconducting  RF  (SRF)  structures.  In  order 
to
efficiently  provide  a  working  control  system,  a  lot  of
modeling  has performed.  The modeling is used as a way
to  specify  RF  components;  verify  system  design  and
performance objectives; optimize control  parameters;  and
to  provide  further  insight  into  the  RF  control  system
operation.

the  satisfactory 

The modeling addressed in this note deals with the PI
feedback controller and the plug-in feedforward controller
(the  iterative  learning  controller).    The  purpose  of  the  PI
feedback controller is to guarantee the  robustness  and the
zero  steady  state  error.  However,  the  PI  feedback
controller  does  not  yield 
transient
performances    for    the  RF  filling    and  the  beam  loading.
The  feedforward  controller  proposed  in  this  note  takes  a
simple form and is effective.  In order to  generate the one
step ahead feedforward control, the feedforward controller
makes  use  of  current  error,  the  derivative  of  the  current
error  and  the  integration  of  the  current  error.  This  PID-
type  feedforward  controller  is  the  natural  consequence  of
the  PI  feedback  control  system  where  the  inverse  of  the
closed  loop  system  transfer  matrix  has  the  same  form  as
the  transfer  matrix  of  the  PID  system.  The  proposed
feedforward controller achieves the better performance for

the  repetitive  reference  trajectory  to  be  tracked  by  the
system  output  and  achieves  the  suppression  of  the
repetitive disturbance such as the Lorentz force detuning.

2  SUPERCONDUCTING CAVITY MODEL

The  modeling  of  a  superconducting    cavity  is  based
on the assumption that the RF generator and the cavity are
connected  with  a  transformer.    The  equivalent  circuit  of
the  cavity  is  transformed  to  the  equivalent  circuit  of  RF
generator  with  transmission    line  (wave  guide)    and  the
model 
is
represented by the state space equation .

The  period  of  the  beam  pulse  is  16.67

The  objective  of  the  SRF  controller  is  to  generate  a
periodic  reference  trajectory  whose  period  is  16.67
secm
periodically  so  that  the  RF  power  is  delivered  to  the
periodic  beam  pulse  safely[3].    A  control  system  that  is
suited  for  this  type  of  applications  is  Iterative  Learning
Control (ILC) [1],[3].

       The  Q -filter  is  designed  such  that  it  suppresses  the
high  frequency  components  at  which  the  plant  model  is
inaccurate  and  passes  low  frequency,  at  which  the  model
is  accurate.  The  Q -filter  is  either  placed  before  the
memory,    or  in  the  memory  feedback  loop.  Thus,  the
bandwidth  of  the  Q -filter  should  be  chosen  greater  than
or  equal  to  the  desired  closed  loop  bandwidth.  From  the
¥H  controller design  point  of  view,    (8)  interprets  the  -

       To design a  L -filter, detailed knowledge of the plant
is  required.  For  low  frequency  dynamics,  a  competent
model  of  the  plant  often  exists.    However,  identification
and modeling of  high frequency dynamics is difficult and
may  lead  to  an  inadequate  model.  This  could  result  in  a

4  SIMULATION

The  closed  loop  system  with  PI  feedback  controller
and  iterative  learning  controller  was  simulated.  Figure  1
and  figure  2    show  the  field  amplitude  and    the  field
phase,    where  the  great    improvement  of  the  transient
behaviors  both  in  RF  filling  and    in  beam  loading  is
observed as iteration number increases.  Also, two figures
show  that  the  periodic  Lorentz  force  detuning  effect  on
the  field  amplitude  and  the  field  phase  is  suppressed
gradually  as  the  iteration  number  increases.  Figure  3
shows  the  Lorentz  force  detuning.  Note  that    the  static

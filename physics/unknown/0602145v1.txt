Abstract 
      As a starting point in understanding Quantum Mechanics, the postulates of Quantum  
      Mechanics are presented, and few of the main eigenvalue  problems, as well.  
 
 
Introduction. 
Quantum  Mechanics  is  an  axiomatic  theory  because  it  is  well-grounded  on  few 
 
principles (from the Latin principium), or axioms (from the Greek, axios), or postulates 
(from  the  Latin  postulatum),  all  of  these  words  meaning  the  same  thing:  a  truth  which 
doesn’t need any further proof, because it is obvious by itself. 
There  is  not  a  consensus  of  how  many  axioms  one  needs  to  describe  the  machinery  of 
Quantum  Mechanics,  but  I  think  that  five  is  an  appropriate  number.  The  first  four 
postulates,  as  we  shall  see,  make  up  the  mathematical  background  of  Quantum 
Mechanics, and the fifth supplies the connection between the mathematics introduced by 
the first four and the results of a measurement process. 
As a general rule, the statement of each postulate will be followed by comments, so that 
the  significance  of  words  within  the  postulates  will  be  explained  at  the  right  time, 
namely, when they are introduced. 
 
1. The first postulate of Quantum Mechanics  
 
To every state of a physical system there is a function  Ψ  ascribed to and defining the 
state. 
 
First of all: “there is a function  Ψ ascribed to…” doesn’t mean that there is a one-to-one 
correspondence function – state. As we will see, a state may have more than one function 
if certain conditions are fulfilled.  
“To  define  means  to  limit”  according  to  the  English  writer,  Oscar  Wilde,  so  our 
definitions  will  be  closer  to  the  usual  vocabulary  in  order  to  make  the  book  more 
accessible, but it doesn’t mean that any accuracy is lost. 
A physical system is (from the quantum point of view) a free particle, a particle moving 
in  some  potential,  a  hydrogen  atom,  a  hydrogen  molecule,  or  an  atom  (or  molecule)  of 
whatever  kind,  or  many  particles  of  the  same  kind  or  different.  As  we  can  see,  by  a 
physical system we can understand a finite region of space having certain characteristics 
which make that region different from others.

If there are certain physical quantities, or parameters, which at least in principle can be 
measured, and they remain constant for a finite time interval, then we can speak about the 
state of the physical system. It should be noted that there is a difference between a state 
from the classical point of view and the quantum point of view:  
a) let us say we have a thermodynamic state of an ideal gas, meaning that we know (for 
sure) the pressure, the temperature and the volume. It is understood that we have to do 
with a maximum specification when we speak of  state;  
b) things are different from the quantum point of view when we speak of state, because 
the verb to know does not have the meaning of ‘we know for sure,’ but, as we shall see, 
we know with certain probabilities.  
To  make  a  connection,  we  will  speak  about  a  state  with  maximum  specification  only 
when that state is a pure state, and less then maximum specification when we deal with a 
mixed (or an “impure”) state. What do we mean by pure and mixed states, we will find 
out a little bit later. 
, depending of the usual space coordinates (x, y, z) and time t,  is called a 
 
Ψ(x,y,
wavefunction. When we speak about the state of a physical system, then 
depends of 
space  coordinates  only,  and  when  we  speak  about  evolution,  the  time  dependence  of 
must be taken into account. Generally, the wave-function is a complex function, which 
Ψ
∗Ψ , as well, obtained by changing 
means that we have to do with its complex conjugate 
the imaginary number  i  into  -i. 
 
The significance of the wave-function 
Max  Born  has  the  merit  of  clarifying  the  meaning  of  the  wave-function  as  being    the 
probability  amplitude.  Let  us  consider  the  simplest  atom  consisting  of  one  proton  and 
one electron – the hydrogen atom. Taking the proton as the centre of a reference system, 
the hydrogen’s electron must be somewhere around the proton at, say the distance r. The 
wave.-function will be 
, if we work in spherical coordinates. The 
ϕ

probability to find the electron somewhere at a distance r from the proton is:

If  we  take  the  integral  of  expression  (1),  from  zero  to  infinity,  we  are  sure  that  the

First  of  all,  why  vectors?  Because  there  is  another  name  for  the  wave-function,  or 
probability  amplitude,  namely    state  vector.  Let  us  have  a  vector  rr   of  modulus  1,  and

Actually,  the  expression  (8)  is  the  mathematical  formulation  of  a  general  physical 
if 
principle, 
principle 
the 
represent  physically  realizable  processes,  then  any  linear 
Ψ,Ψ,Ψ
combination of the form (8) is also a physical realizable process. 
A  system  of  functions  allowing  the  expression  (8)  and  the  closure  relation  (9)  is  called 
complete and closed.  
 
Dirac’s writing. 
Splitting the word bracket in two: bra and ket, Dirac invented a special form of writing, 
generally  used  today  in  Quantum  Theories.  Here  is  Dirac’s  writing:  a  physical  process 
starting  from  an  initial  state  and  reaching  a  final  state  is  described  by  the  probability 
amplitude 
                                               

                                                         (10)    

initial

final

The vector  final  is the bra vector and   initial   is the ket  vector, observing that 

the bra vector  final  is the complex conjugate of the ket vector  final .  What we 
have in the right part of the vertical line is always the initial state, and what we have in 

4

left  part  is  the  final  state.  For  instance,
,  the  probability  amplitude  describing  the 
(EG)D
process of a particle leaving the source EG and reaching the detector D is now written as:

Conclusion 
1.We  saw  that  the  wave-function,  the  probability  amplitude  and  the  state  vector,  
represent the same thing. 
2. We were introduced to functions such as,  Ψ , which have the following properties: 
a) the probability amplitudes are uniform functions, namely in every point of the physical 
space have a definite value; 
b) the wave – functions are bounded in entire space; 
c) the wave- functions are continous and their partial derivatives are also continous; 
d) the functions are integrable in squared modulus, namely  
     

  is convergent;

associated a number called inner product

vectors  i
complex conjugate of the expression (8):

because  wave-functions  Ψ   have  the  norm  1,  see  (3),  and  the  complex  coefficients

According  to  expression  (18),  the  coefficients  of  the  Ψ   expansion  (8)  are  uniquely

The above expression, (20) represents the general relation of  orthonormality : the inner 
product is  1  for normalized wave-functions, and zero for orthogonal wave-functions. 
Any collection of  n (

nΨ ) mutually orthogonal vectors of unit length in 
an n-dimensional space vector, satisfying condition (20), makes up the orthonormal basis 
for that space. 
Note. The first postulate doesn’t tell us how to find the wave-function, and, as matter of 
fact, it is not meant to tell us that. This postulate only says that the wave-function offers 
the maximum knowledge. Regarding the probability amplitude, or wave-fuction, or state 
vector, and what are they good for, we shall learn more after the third postulate. 
 
2. The second postulate of Quantum Mechanics  
 
If    ℋ1  is  the  Hilbert  space  associated  with  the    physical  system  S1,  and    ℋ2    is  the 
Hilbert space corresponding to the other physical system S2,  then the composite system  
S1  +  S2    will  be  associated  with  the  tensor  product  of  the  two  Hilbert  vector  spaces  
ℋ1 ⊗ ℋ2. 

 
As  a  summary,  the  second  postulate  of  Quantum  Mechanics  defines  the  word  and,  as 
1  and 
Roger  Penrose  [3]  suggests.  Let  us  consider  the  non-null  vectors

Ψ

Ψ is a vector in ℋ1 ⊗ ℋ2 describing a state of the composite system  S1 + S2. When the 
composite system S1 + S2  is in the state  Ψ , can we say in what state  S1 is in, and what 
state S2 is in? Definitely not! Neither S1, nor S2 are in a definite state.  
given  by  (21)  is an entangled state      [4]. 
The state 
This second postulate outlines another strange possibility: quantum non-locality. If both 
systems  S1  and  S2  are  well  separated  in  space,  the  entangled  state  Ψ of    S1  +  S2    is  a 
manifestation  of  non-locality,  but  a  non-locality  in  a  correlated  manner,  because  if  we 
measure  a  physical  quantity  for  the  first  particle,  the  same  physical  quantity  for  the 
second seems to be already fixed by the measurement done on the first, as we shall see 
later. 
The  entangled  states  and  the  quantum  non-locality  are  very  important  for  quantum 
computation. 
 
 
3. The third postulate of Quantum Mechanics 
 
To  every  observable  of  a  physical  system  is  associated  a  self-adjoint  (or  Hermitian) 
operator allowing a complete set of eigenfunctions. 
 
An  observable  is  any  physical  quantity  which  can  be  measured  by  an  experimental 
procedure, such as: position, momentum, angular momentum, energy, etc. 
An  operator  is  an  instruction  showing  us  how  to  obtain  a  function  g(x)  if  we  know 
another  function  f(x),  or  the  operator  maps  a  function  f(x)  into  another  function  g(x). 
From now on the operators will be written with capital bold letters. Let O be an operator 
and f(x) a certain function of coordinate x. Applying the operator O to the function f(x) 
we will get the function g(x): 
                                                          
                                                      (22)   
f(x)=
Being in the frame of Quantum Mechanics, our functions are the wave-functions,
’s, so 
that  the  operators  will  map  a  function  from  Hilbert  space  into  another  function  from 
Hilbert space. 
The physical equivalent of an operator is some device changing something in a particle’s 
state.  For  instance:  an  electron  moves  along  a  straight  line.  If  the  electron  enters  the 
electric  field  of  a  parallel-plate  capacitor,  its  path  will  be  curved,  so  the  electron  is  in 
another state. In this case, the parallel-plate capacitor is the physical operator.

Let ℬ be an observable, B the corresponding operator and

Since we deal with linear operators only, as a general rule, we shall omit the word linear. 
The theory of linear operators is the mathematical apparatus of Quantum Mechanics.

Derivative    and    integral  are  linear  operators  because  they  satisfy  rule  (25)  being 
distributive against addition. 
 
Eigenvalues spectra                                    
The general problem of Quantum Mechanics is to solve equations of the type (24), or, in 
other words, to get the solutions for eigenfunctions  Ψ , and  eigenvalues  b. 
Regarding the eigenvalues, the ensemble of the b values we have got as solutions of the 
linear operator equation makes up the eigenvalues spectrum. If  b can take only certain 
values, we say that the eigenvalues spectrum is discrete. If  b  can take any value, then 
the  spectrum  is  continuous.  For  example,  the  position  of  a  particle  can  take  any  value 
along the axis of real numbers, so its eigenvalues spectrum is a continuous one.  
The hydrogen’s electron can be only on certain levels, so the electron’s energy can take 
certain values only, its eigenvalues spectrum being discrete. 
If the eigenvalue spectrum is a discrete one, then the norm is of the type (3) or (20) and 
the expansion using the basis vectors is of the form (8) with closure relation (9), but if the 
spectrum is a continuous one, such kind of expressions are, as we shall see, of a different 
type. 
For some details of continuous spectra, see, e.g.  [5,6]. 
 
A few necessary definitions 
a) If we have two operators A and B, then their sum A + B is also an operator:

b) If we have two operators A and B, then their product A B is also an operator:

then we say that the two operators A and B commute and [A,B] is called the commutator 
of  A and B  
d) If  A is an operator and if there is an operator A-1 , such that 
                                                    
then A-1 is the inverse operator, with I the identity operator. 
 
Self-adjoint operator 
While studying a physical process, we are interested in values: values of energy, values 
of  angular  momentum,  etc.,  namely  in  real  numbers.  The  corresponding  operators 
dealing with real numbers (as eigenvalues) are self-adjoint or Hermitian operators. Let’s 
see how it works! 
Let A be an operator and 
                                           
A
then  A+ is called the adjoint operator of A.  
If                                                      A = A+                                                                     (32)      
then   A   is a  self-adjoint, or  Hermitian  operator. 
The eigenvalues of self-adjoint operators are real numbers. 
Let A be a Hermitian operator and  Ψ one of its eigenfunctions, then according to (32) we 
can write: 
                                                    

 two state vectors. If the following equality takes place:

  Observation.  I  saw  the  following  sentence  in  a  university  book  [7,  p38]:  “In  quantum 
mechanics,  an  observable  is  a  self-adjoint  operator”.  It  seems  to  me  the  observation  is 
somewhat  shallow.  An  observable  is  a  physical  quantity,  and  an  operator  is  a 
mathematical “device” acting on a vector space, as the third postulate clarifies. 
 
The momentum  and  position  eigenvalue  problems 
 
Momentum  and  position  are  two  observables  and,  according  to  the  third  postulate,  two 
Hermitian operators are associated with them.  
Momentum’s eigenvalue  problem   
Let us, for the beginning, consider that  pr  is the particle’s momentum, Px the operator for 
the  momentum  corresponding  to  the  x-axis,  px  its  eigenvalue  and 
  the 
corresponding  eigenfunction. The eigenvalue equation is: 
                                               
x=
p
xP
If  we  solve  this  equation,  then  we  will  know  the  eigenfunctions  and  eigenvalues,  but,  
first we must know the form of the operator Px. The third postulate does not explain how 
to find the operators corresponding to observables. So? The answer is similitude. One of 
the solutions of the differential equation of electromagnetic waves (and not only) is the 
plane wave. Let 

 be such a monochromatic plane wave :

with N the norm constant. 
What  about  eigenvalues?  Momentum  being  the  product  of  mass  and  velocity,  the 
eigenvalue spectrum is continuous, because the velocity can take any value between  -c 
and  +c, (c light speed in vacuum), and mass can be any positive real number. Now, the 
momentum eigenfunction can be written as: 

i

xpx

                                                 
                                                    (43)   
because px is a real variable like x. What about N? It will be determined very soon. The

wavefunctions  for

momenta. 
 How does one norm eigenfunctions corresponding to continuous spectra of eigenvalues? 
Let  us  recall  the  direct  product  (12)  and  consider  that  we  are  dealing  with  a  one-
dimensional problem. It means that  
                                                     

  and   Ψ  can be written as:

The position’s eigenvalue problem 
To find the position operator we will use the similitude again. From Classical Mechanics   
[6]    [32]  we  know  the  Poisson  brackets.  Let    f  and  g  be  two  functions  of  coordinates 
).  The  Poisson  bracket  corresponding  to  these  two 
(

functions is:

This expression (66), seems to be related to (65) if we can find something which is closed

Then, equation (67) can be written:  

 be the wavefunction of  the position operator X. 

                                                          (68)

The transition from (67) to (69) can be made only if the action of the position operator 
consists  in  multiplying  a  function.  In  the  expression  (69)  the  bracket  seems  to  play  a 
similar role with the Poisson bracket. Has it any significance? Yes, it is also an operator, 

more precisely the commutator of the operators X and  

, and perhaps Dirac followed 

∂
x∂

a similar way to introduce the operators’ commutativity and the corresponding properties. 
The  eigenvalues  of  the  position  operator  make  up  a  continuous  spectrum  because  the 
position of a particle can be any real number.

The angular momentum’s eigenvalue problem

which is a vector, defined as:

Knowing that to the observables position and momentum correspond Hermitian operators

replacing  the  classical  observables  by  corresponding  operators  according  to  the  third

Now, we have to determine the eigenvalues  µ and the norm constant  N. The uniformity

So, the eigenvalue spectrum of the angular momentum operator

What  are    these  numbers    l    and    m  ?  As  one  can  see,  l    and    m  are  connected  to  the 
eigenvalues of the angular momentum operators   
z . They are called  quantum 
numbers: l is the orbital quantum number and  m is the magnetic quantum number. Why 
are  these  numbers  called  orbital  and  magnetic  respectively?  I  think  there  are  historical 
reasons:  the  first  application  of  Quantum  Mechanics  was  the  simplest  atom,  namely, 
z  its 
hydrogen, so, the electron orbiting the nucleus has an angular momentum 
L
projection onto the z-axis (an external magnetic field, e.g.), hence we have got l as orbital 
quantum  number  and    m  as  magnetic  quantum  number  which  has  nothing  magnetic  in 
itself.

In the above equation  H is going to play a major role. What is it? Let’s find out! Firstly, 

Ψ(t)
if H doesn’t depend on time, starting from (96), we will get  
What can be that “something”? Let’s come back to classical Physics.. 
The  expression  (37)  is  a  plane  wave,  and  it  seems  to  be  the  “relative”  of  the  solution 
containing “something”. By comparison  we can think of “something” as being energy. 
Taking the time derivative of (37), we get:

The Schrödinger equation

Obviously, in the above expression, the total energy is the non-relativistic energy. 
Note 
Here,  and  everywhere  else  (unless  it  is  explicitly  said),  by  “m”  we  will  understand  the 
particle’s  (or  physical  system’s)  mass  in  the  sense  of  Einstein’s  Theory  of  Relativity, 
namely,  the  particle’s  mass  in  the  reference  system  where  the  particle  (or  the  physical 
system) is at rest. 
In  (98)  we  see  two  kinds  of  physical  quantities,  or  (if  measurable),  two  kinds  of 
observables:  momentum,  whose  self-adjoint  operators  are  derivatives  with  respect  to 
coordinates, and potential energy. The momentum has its own operators, but what about 
the  potential  energy?  The  potential  energy  depends  on  the  particle’s  (or  physical 
system’s) coordinates, so it is not that “crazy” to think that the operator corresponding to 
the potential energy is a multiplicative one, much like the position’s operator. Hence, the 
total energy’s operator will be found by replacing the classical quantities with quantum 
corresponding operators.

will be called Hamiltonian. H may be, or may not be dependent on time. With H given

Equation  (102)  is,  also,  the    Schrödinger    equation,  but,  this  version  of  the  equation  is 
independent  of  time.  In  other  words,  it  is  the  stationary  Schrödinger    equation.  This 
equation  (102)  is  the  energy  eigenvalue  equation,  which  tells  us  that  if  the  physical 

 

19

system has the energy E at the initial time, then at any subsequent time it will have the 
same  energy.  The  stationary  Schrödinger    equation  is  the  fundamental  equation  of  the 
microscopic world with definite energies, e.g. molecules, atoms, nuclei, etc. Knowing the 
potential  energy,  or  the  interaction  potential  U(x,y,z),  by  integrating  the  stationary 
Schrödinger  equation  we  can  find  the  energy  eigenvalues  and  eigenfunctions  of  the 
physical system. 
   Observation.  It  is  necessary  to  outline  that  the  operator  H  in  the  time-dependent  
Schrödinger equation  (100) is the Hamiltonian of the system, and H from the stationary 
Schrödinger    equation      is  the  operator  energy  .  The  two  H  are  identical  only  if    the 
Hamiltonian doesn’t depend on time.                      
 
An important property 
If

Measurements 
5. The fifth postulate of Quantum Mechanics 
 
The fifth postulate outlines the statistical nature of Quantum Mechanics and bridges the 
mathematical  apparatus  introduced  by  the  first  four  postulates  and  the  experimental 
results of a measuring process. 
Let  (cid:45) be an observable and F the corresponding Hermitian operator. With 
the eigenfunctions, the eigenvalue equation can be written as: 
                                                       
Considering the general case of a joint (discrete + continuous) eigenvalue spectrum, the 
superposition principle may be written as: 

                                                                (105)

Question. If we arrange an experimental set-up to measure the observable   (cid:45), then what 
are the values we will expect to get? The answer is given by the fifth postulate: 
As a result of a measuring process performed upon an observable   (cid:45), we will obtain 
only  the  eigenvalues  of  the  Hermitian  operator,  F,  associated  to  the  observable.  The 
kc , 
probability of getting an eigenvalue 
  corresponding  to  the  continuous

 corresponding to the discrete spectrum is

Over  the  years,  the  measuring  process  in  Quantum  Mechanics  gave  rise  to  a  lot  of 
discussions, not only concerning physics, but also philosophy. As we have seen before, 
there are entangled states, so if we have two separate particles being (each one of them) 
in definite states, then the system of both particles is in an indefinite state. Furthermore, if 
we  measure  a  physical  quantity  for  one  particle,  then  Quantum  Mechanics  predicts  the 
correct value of the same physical quantity for the second particle without measurements, 
as we shall see soon. 
 
 
The expected value of an observable 
Let  “a”  be  a  random  variable  taking  (along  a  measuring  process)  the  values

postulate, is F. The fifth postulate says that during the measuring process we will get the

“words” of the fifth postulate, the expected value of   (cid:45)  will be:

So, the expected value of   (cid:45)  is an inner product:

A  very  interesting  expression!  If  the  operators  H  and  F    commute,  then  the  time 
derivative  of  the  observable  (cid:45)  is  zero,  which  means  the  observable  remains  constant. 
Here  is  a  symmetry  statement:  for  any  physical  system  with  the  Hamiltonian  H,  the 
observables  which  will  be  conserved  are  those  whose  operators  commute  with  H.  And 
more: if two operators commute, they have simultaneous eigenfunctions. For details, see 
e.g.[5]. For example, the operators X and Py commute, which means that the observable 
“x” and  “py” are independent variables and can be precisely measured simultaneously.

And  even  more:  the  commutativity  of  operators  outlines  the  possibility  of  measuring 
simultaneously the corresponding observables. For instance, operators X and Px, and the 
next two pairs, do not commute, 
                                            [

 and it means that the corresponding pairs of variables

Uncertainty relations 
 
We have learned enough to deduce the general form of the uncertainty relations. 
Let us consider two Hermitian operators F and G. Let C be the commutator of the two: 
                                                C = [F,G] = FG - GF  
The operator   iC  is also Hermitian, as one can easily prove. 
Lets also, consider  Q = F + i α G, with  α a real constant. Because the adjoint operator of 
Q is Q + = F - i α G, Q  is not Hermitian. Let’s have R = Q +Q = (F - iαG)( F + iαG) = F 
2 + α iC+ α2 G2,  
and  ℜ  be  the  R’s  eigenvalue.  Then,  if  Ψ  is  the  probability  amplitude  describing  the 
quantum system, according to (129), the expected value of ℜ is: 
                                  < ℜ > = 
 0

                  < ℜ > = < (cid:45)
2>,  
The  last  expression  is  an  algebraic  equation  of  the  second  degree,  coefficients  <  (cid:45)
<i(cid:42) >,< (cid:46)2> being real numbers because the corresponding operators are Hermitian. So, 
in order to be satisfied, one has to have: <i2(cid:42)2 > - 4 < (cid:45)
(cid:25)(cid:42)  

                                                   < (cid:45)
Equal ( =) sign means the root of the above algebraic equation is double and real, and so, 
QΨ = 0. 
Let (cid:40) and (cid:41) be two observables and A and B the corresponding Hermitian operators. We 
2>  =  <∆(cid:40)2> and < (cid:46)2> =  
can choose  (cid:45) = (cid:40) - < (cid:40) > and          (cid:46) = (cid:41) - <(cid:41)>, then < (cid:45)
<  ∆(cid:41)2>,  so  we  have:  <∆(cid:40)2><∆(cid:41)2>  r 

(cid:25)(cid:42) .  If    ∆(cid:40)  =  (<∆(cid:40)2>)  1/  2    and    ∆(cid:41)  =

(<∆(cid:41)2>) 1/ 2 , assimilate with standard deviations, then we will get the most general form 
of the uncertainty relations: 

                                                            ∆(cid:40) ∆(cid:41) r

(cid:42) is the observable corresponding to the commutator operator C, and  (cid:42)  becomes zero 

only if  C = 0, which means that F  and G  commute, and  ∆(cid:40) ∆(cid:41) r 0, equal sign (=)  

meaning that ∆(cid:40) may be zero, or ∆(cid:41) can be zero, or even both of them are null. Such a

situation opens up the possibility of measuring exactly, and simultaneously, two physical 
quantities, the corresponding operators A and B, for the same wave function, Ψ. 
 If  (cid:42) ∫ 0 there is no possibility of having both ∆(cid:40) =0 and ∆(cid:41) = 0, which means that, by 
no means, can we have a quantum physical  system  that allows to get well determined 
values simultaneously. If, for instance the observable (cid:40) is precisely determined, then ∆(cid:40) 

=0, without having any information about (cid:41)  because  ∆(cid:41)  ∞→ , and reversely.

surface  integrals,  nv   being  the  outer  normal  of  the  elementary  surface  dA.  Reading 
formula (117), we can say that the change in time of the probability equals the negative 
of the flux of the probability current density through the surface Σ. If we integrate over 
the entire space, then Σ becomes the surface tending to infinity and taking into account 
the properties of the vectors of Hilbert space (the wave-functions at infinity are zero)  the 
right side of the expression (117) will cancel, conserving probability and other quantities

The classical limit of Quantum Mechanics 
 
There  is  a  principle  due  to  Niels  Bohr:  the  correspondence  principle.  Essentially, 
according to this principle, every new physical theory must contain as a limit case the old 
theory. So, the Classical Mechanics must be a limiting case of Quantum Mechanics. How 
is that? Similitude again! The geometrical optics are obtained from the wave optics as a

limiting case when the wavelength

Let  us  suppose  that  equation  (118)  is  a  solution  of  the  Schrödinger  equation  (100).

equation (120) is nothing else  but the Hamilton – Jacobi equation of a particle of mass 
“m”  moving  in  a    potential  U.  Indeed,  the  Classical  Mechanics  is  the  limiting  case  of 
.  Also,  Paul  Ehrenfest  [10]  proved  two  theorems 
Quantum  Mechanics,  when 
asserting:  the  expected  values  of  Quantum  Mechanics’  observables  satisfy  the  same 
equations as Classical Mechanics’ variables. To prove Ehrenfest’s theorems is a pretty 
easy  task  if  we  use  the  results  of  “the  expected  values  and  the  time  derivative  of  the 
expected values” discussed above. 
 
Conclusion 
The  five  postulates  presented  above,  may  be  considered  as  the  general  frame  of  the 
conventional Quantum Mechanics and they will help in  applying Quantum Mechanics to 
simple physical systems.

Quasicrystals1,2,  realized  in  metal  alloys3,4,  are  a  class  of  lattices  exhibiting 

symmetries that fall outside the usual classification for periodic crystals. They do 

not  have  translational  symmetry  and  yet  the  lattice  points  are  well  ordered.  

Furthermore,  they  exhibit  higher  rotational  symmetry  than  periodic  crystals.  

Because  of  the  higher  symmetry  (more  spherical),  they  are  more  optimal  than 

periodic  crystals  in  achieving  complete  photonic  bandgaps5,6  in  a  new  class  of 

materials  called  photonic  crystals7-10  in  which  the  propagation  of  light  in  certain 

frequency  ranges  is  forbidden. 

  The  potential  of  quasicrystals  has  been 

demonstrated in two dimensions for the infrared range11-14 and, recently, in three-

dimensional  icosahedral  quasicrystals  fabricated  using  a  stereo  lithography 

method for the microwave range15.    Here, we report the fabrication and optical 

characterization  of  icosahedral  quasicrystals  using  a  holographic  lithography 

method16 for the visible range.  The icosahedral pattern, generated using a novel 7-

beam optical interference holography, is recorded on photoresists and holographic 

plates.    Electron  micrographs  of  the  photoresist  samples  show  clearly  the 

symmetry  of  the  icosahedral  quasicrytals  in  the  submicron  range,  while  the 

holographic plate samples exhibit bandgaps in the angular-dependent transmission 

spectra in the visible range.  Calculations of the bandgaps due to reflection planes 

inside  the  icosahedral  quasicrystal  show  good  agreement  with  the  experimental 

results.

Quasicrystalline structures (quasicrystals), discovered in metal alloys in the early 

eighties, have a higher point group symmetry than ordinary periodic crystals.3,4    They 

exhibit  long-range  aperiodic  order  and  rotational  symmetries  that  fall  outside  the 

traditional crystallographic classification schemes.1,2  It was suggested5,6 and realized in 

2D11-14  that  mesoscale  quasicrystals  may  possess  photonic  bandgaps  (in  which 

electromagnetic wave propagation is forbidden), a character of a new class of materials 

called  photonic  crystals7,8.  Furthermore,  because  of  their  higher  rotational  symmetry, 

the  bandgaps  of  quasicrystals  are  more  isotropic  and  thus  are  more  favourable  in 

achieving complete bandgaps than conventional photonic crystals.7-10  Photonic crystals 

have  been  fabricated  by 

techniques  such  as 

the  self-assembly  of  colloidal 

microspheres17,18  or  micro-fabrication19-20,  and,  recently,  holographic  lithography21-24 

and multi-photon direct laser writing25.  However, it is difficult to fabricate quasicrystals 

by  the  self-assembly  and  micro-fabrication  techniques,  and  is  very  time  consuming  to 

use  the  direct  laser  writing  technique.    Icosahedral  quasicrystals  exhibiting  sizeable 

bandgaps  in  the  microwave  range  have  been  fabricated  using  a  stereo  lithography 

method15.  However, it is still a challenge to fabricate quasicrystals in the visible range.  

Recently, it has been demonstrated that holographic lithography can be used to fabricate 

2D and quasi-3D quasicrystals26,27 in photoresists in the submicron range.  Furthermore, 

one of us has shown that it is possible to obtain interference patterns with icosahedral 

symmetry  using  a  novel  7-beam  configuration28.    Here  we  report  the  realization  and 

optical  characterization  of  icosahedral  quasicrystals  for  the  visible  range  using  the 

optical interference holography technique suggested in ref. 28. 

Quasicrystals  can  be  classified  either  as  physical  3D  projections  of  higher-

dimensional  periodic  structures  or  in  terms  of  wave  vectors  in  the  reciprocal  space 

corresponding  to  the  diffraction  patterns  of  the  quasicrystals1-2,29.    It  is  the  reciprocal 

space  approach  that  provides  the  basis  for  fabricating  quasicrystals  using  optical 

interference  holography29.

Figure  1c  shows  the  experimental  setup  for  the  7-beam  interference.    Beams, 

for i = 0 to 5, are obtained by passing an expanded beam from an argon ion laser of 

wavelength 488 nm through a template with five side holes distributed evenly around a 

central  hole.  The  six  beams  with  diameter  9  mm,  power  15  mW,  and  polarization 

adjusted by wave plates mounted on the template, enter a truncated pentagonal pyramid 

from  the  base  as  shown  in  Fig.  1c.    The  central  beam  goes  straight  up  the  pyramid, 

while the side beams are reflected internally at the slanted surfaces of the pyramid.  The 

4 

seventh beam 

 is obtained by reflecting 

 from a mirror mounted above the sample

r

placed on the truncated pyramid.  The side beams, with incidence angle ϕ, all intersect 

with the central beams at the sample as shown in Fig. 1c.  Using this setup, the beams 

are more uniform and, more importantly, the phases of the beams are fixed because they 

are  obtained  from  the  same  expanded  beam.   The  arrangement  in  Fig.  1c  gives  the  5-

fold symmetry projection on the sample surface.  To obtain other symmetry projections, 

the sample is sandwiched between a pair of prisms specially made with the appropriate 

angles as shown in Fig. 1d.  Good index matching is essential in the experiment because 

of the large incidence angle for the side beams.  

We  used  the  Shell  “SU8”  photoresist  resin  (sensitized  to  the  488  nm  line  of  the 

argon  ion  laser  and  with  refractive  index  (1.62)  the  same  as  the  truncated  pentagonal 

pyramid) as the recording medium.  The resin was spin-coated on glass substrates with 

the same refractive index as the SU8 to form ~20 µm thick samples.  After exposure of 

about ~10 s using beam polarizations as in the simulations in Fig. 1b but with no phase 

adjustment because the icosahedral symmetry is not sensitive to the phases, the sample 

was  developed  following  the  procedures  reported  earlier24.    During  the  developing 

processes, polymerization occurred only in regions where the exposure dosage exceeded 

a  critical  value,  while  under-exposed  regions  were  washed  away,  creating  a  copy  of 

photoresist-air  microstructure  for  the  icosahedral  quasicrystal.    Figures  2b-d  and  3b-d 

show  scanning  electron  microscope  (SEM)  images  of  icosahedral  samples  obtained 

using  two  truncated  pentagonal  prisms  for  incidence  angles  ϕ  =  63.4o  and  53.2o, 

corresponding 

to 

the  regular  (Fig.  2a)  and  “flattened” 

icosahedral  (Fig.  3a) 

quasicrystals, respectively.  The SEM images show clearly the 5-fold (Figs. 2b and 3b), 

3-fold  (Figs.  2c  and  3c),  and  2-fold  (Figs.  2d  and  3d)  symmetries,  corresponding 

respectively to the projections along the F, U, and P directions indicated in Fig. 1b.  The 

upper-left  insets  are  simulated  projections  of  the  corresponding  symmetries  using  a 

lower  intensity  cutoff  than  the  projections  in  Fig.  1b.    There  is  a  good  agreement 

5 

between  experiment  and  simulations.    Note  that  although  the  prism  angle  (30o  chosen 

from  standard  optics)  used  for  the  incidence  angle  ϕ  =  53.2o  is  different  from  the 

preferred angles (31.8o for 3-fold and 26.6o for 2-fold), good 3-fold (Fig. 3c) and 2-fold 

(Fig. 3d) symmetry projections can still be obtained.  The lower-right insets of Figs. 2b 

and 3b show the 3D nature of the fabricated quasicrystals.    Note that Figs. 2c-d, with 

lattice  spacings  ~  200nm,  are  slightly  over  exposed,  presumably  due  to  the  finite 

resolution of the optical interference system, for attempts with lower exposures were not 

successful in producing “less-connected” samples.  Furthermore, the microstructures of 

the  samples  are  not  sufficiently  uniform  (due  to  deformations  during  developing 

processes  and  shrinkage  of  the  photoresist)  for  optical  measurements,  even  though 

spectral reflections can be observed at some angles. 

In view of  the  non-uniformity obtained using  the  SU8  photoresist,  we  have  also 

used the high-resolution dichromate gelatin (DCG) holographic plate PFG-04 (Slavich, 

Russia) as the recording medium.  However, due to the dielectric mismatch between the 

gelatin (~24 µm thick and nDCG ~ 1.57 before exposure at 488 nm), the glass substrate 

(2 mm thick and ng = 1.52), and the truncated pentagonal pyramid (nt = 1.62), we could 

only obtain good samples with the 5-fold symmetry project on the sample surface using 

the smaller incidence angle ϕ = 53.2o.  (This corresponds to an incidence angle of ϕ = 

55.7o  in  DCG.)    After  15  s  exposure,  the  DCG  plate  was  developed  using  a  thermal 

hardening  procedure  refined  by  us  recently  to  obtained  high  diffraction  effiency30.  

During  the  developing  processes,  the  well-exposed  regions  inside  the  DCG  would 

generate  submicron  air-voids,  confirmed  by  SEM  images30,  while  the  under-exposed 

regions  would  remain  intact,  creating  a  3D  microstructure  with  modulations  of 

refractive index.  Since DCG is sensitive to moisture, a cover glass was placed on the 

top of the developed DCG emulsion and sealed with wax for protection30.  It was found 

that the DCG emulsion undergoes an overall 10-20% expansion and 5-10% shrinkage in 

the z- and xy- directions, respectively, compensating the smaller incidence angle for the 

6 

regular  icosahedral  quasicrystal.    Despite  the  relatively  low  dielectric  contrast,  the 

fabricated  icosahedral  quasicrystal  DCG  samples  (of  size  ~  9  mm)  show  beautiful 

diffraction patterns projected on the back side of the glass substrate of the DCG sample  

and sharp reflections  under white light as shown in the top schematic diagram of Fig. 

4a with the sample facing the incident beam.  The right inset of Fig. 4a shows clearly 

two  5-fold  symmetry  diffraction  orders,  inner  dark-blue  and  outer  blue-green, 

corresponding to two different bandgaps at normal incidence, verifying the icosahedral 

5-fold symmetry.  However, these diffractions, because of the large diffraction angles, 

are all internally reflected inside the glass substrate and cannot be measured directly by 

the optical fiber connected to a spectrometer as shown in Fig. 4a, resulting in only one 

sharp  reflection  (green  line)  bandgap  at  560  nm  and  three  transmission  (red  line) 

bandgaps  at  560  nm,  500  nm,  and  400  nm  for  normal  incidence  as  shown  in  Fig.  4a.  

The  lower-left  photo  insets  of  Fig.  4a  show  the  appearance  for  the  normal  reflection 

(green) and transmission (light purple, due to overall high transmittance) using diffused 

white light, consistent with the optical spectra. 

To  obtain  the  angular  dependent  transmission  spectrum,  the  DCG  sample  was 

mounted vertically on a rotation platform as shown in the top inset of Fig. 4a and the 

incidence angle was scanned every 2.5o in air from θ = −65o to 65o.  This corresponds to 

θ  =  −37o  to  37o  in  the  DCG  by  using  an  effective  dielectric  constant  of  1.5  estimated 

from  the  volume  changes  for  the  DCG  after  development.    Figures  4b  and  c  show 

transmission bandgaps, as color intensity indicated by the scale bar on the right, versus 

the  incidence  angle  in  the  visible  range,  with  the  5-fold  symmetry  axis  along  and 

perpendicular to the axis of rotation, respectively.  It can be seen that the bandgaps are 

symmetric about θ = 0o for the 5-fold axis along the rotation axis (Fig. 4b) while they 

are  asymmetric  for  the  perpendicular  case  (Fig.  4c).    Furthermore,  the  bandgaps  are 

separated  into  four  groups,  with  three  groups  corresponding  to  the  three  normal 

transmission  bandgaps  shown  in  Fig.  4a,  and  the  fourth  one  arising  only  at  large 

7 

incidence angles.  It turns out that these bandgaps can be explained by the reflections of 

planes  inside  the  icosahedral  quasicrystal.    For  every  reciprocal  vector

(λ is the wavelength of the interfering beam inside the DCG) are parallel to the sample 

surface30.  These planes produce the bandgap at 560 nm at normal incidence in Fig. 4a 

taking  into  account  a  15%  swelling  in  the  z-direction,  in  accord  with  results  reported 

recently using a 2-beam interference30.  However, due to the differential effects caused 

by the swelling in the z- and shrinkage in the xy- directions of the DCG on the planes 

with  different  orientations,  the  spacings  and  directions  of  these  planes  are  affected 

differently.    Taking  this  into  account,  these  planes  can  then  be  separated  into  four 

groups as those observed in the experiment.  After all, the directional bandgaps, drawn 

as  colored  solid  lines  in  Figs.  4b  and  4c,  from  the  parallel  planes  produced  by  the 

corresponding  reciprocal  vectors  can  be  calculated  using  the  Bragg  condition  with  a 

15%  swelling  and  6%  shrinkage  in  the  z-  and  xy-  directions,  respectively,  and  an 

effective  refractive  index  1.5  for  the  exposed  DCG.    Although  there  are  missing 

branches in the experiment—one red and one green in Fig. 4b due to small values of the

 terms  in  Eq.  (5)  for  the  experimental  parameters—the  agreement  with  the 

j

experimental results is far better than qualitative, confirming further the microstructure 

of the icosahedral quasicrystals fabricated using the 7-beam optical interference. 

To  conclude,  we  have  fabricated  3D  icosahedral  quasicrystals  in  the  submicron 

range  using  a  novel  7-beam  optical  interference  holographic  setup.    SEM  images  of 

samples  fabricated  in  photoresists  show  clearly  the  symmetry  of  icosahedral 

quasicrystals,  in  good  agreement  with  simulated  projections  of  different  symmetries.  

Furthermore, despite the low dielectric contrast, angular dependent transmission spectra 

with distinct bandgaps are obtained for the first time in the visible range using the DCG 

8 

samples of icosahedral quasicrystals.  The observed branches in the transmission spectra 

can  be  explained  by  the  reflections  of  planes  inside  the  quasicrystals  created  by  the 

reciprocal vectors constructed from the interfering wave vectors.  This work opens new 

directions in achieving complete bandgaps for photonic crystals using quasicrystals.

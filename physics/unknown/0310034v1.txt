Introduction 

Atmospheric  weather  systems  are  coherent  structures  consisting  of  discrete 
cloud cells forming patterns of rows/streets, mesoscale clusters (MCC) and spiral 
bands which maintain their identity for the duration of their appreciable life times 
in  the  turbulent  shear  flow  of  the  planetary  Atmospheric  Boundary  Layer  (ABL). 
The  existence  of  coherent  structures (seemingly  systematic  motion) in  turbulent 
flows  has  been  well  established  during  the  last  20  years  of  research  in 
turbulence.  It  is  still,  however  debated  whether  these  structures  are  the 
consequences  of  some  kind  of  instabilities  (such  as  shear,  or  centrifugal 
instabilities)  or  whether  they  are  manifestations  of  some  intrinsic  universal 
properties of any turbulent flow (Levich, 1987). The coherent cloud structures in 
the apparent chaotic (turbulent) flow of the ABL is associated with large values of 
Reynold’s  number  (Re)  up  to  1012  and  by  convention  is  described  by  the 
inherently  non-linear  Navier-Stokes 
(NS)  equations.  Numerical  weather 
prediction models do not give realistic forecasts because of the following inherent 
limitations:  (1)  the  non-linear  governing  equations  for  atmospheric  flows  do  not 
have exact analytic solutions and being sensitive to initial conditions give chaotic 
solutions characteristic of deterministic chaos (2) the governing equations do not 
incorporate  the  dynamical  interactions  and  co-existence  of  the  complete 
spectrum  of  turbulent  fluctuations  which  form  an  integral  part  of  the  large 
coherent weather systems (Shafee and Shafee, 1987) (3) limitations of available 
computer  capacity  necessitates  severe  truncation  of  the  governing  equations, 
thereby  generating  errors  of  approximations  (4)  the  computer  precision  related 
roundoff  errors  magnify  the  earlier  mentioned  uncertainties  exponentially  with 
time and the model predictions become unrealistic (Beck and Roepstorff, 1987). 
The  accurate  modelling  of  weather  phenomena  therefore  requires  alternative 
concepts  and  computational  techniques.  In  this  paper  a  universal  theory  of 
deterministic chaos applicable to the formation of coherent weather structures in 
the  ABL is  presented  with  the  newly identified  computational  technique  "cellular 
automata" suitable for computer parallel processing techniques (Hayot, 1987).

Deterministic Chaos in the ABL 

The universal period doubling route to chaos or deterministic chaos is a signature 
of  non-linearity  and  is  found  to  occur  in  disparate  physical,  chemical  and 
biological  systems  (Feigenbaum,  1980;  Fairbairn,  1986;  Delbourgo,  1986). 
Feigenbaum established that the route to chaos is independent of the nonlinear 
equations describing the system. Lorenz (1963) showed that deterministic chaos 
is  exhibited  by  the  three  coupled  nonlinear  ordinary  differential  equations  for  a 
heat  convective  system  obtained  by  severe  truncation  of  NS  equations. 
Observational  evidence  for  the  existence  of deterministic  chaos  in  the  ABL  has 
been established conclusively by Lovejoy and Schertzer (1986) who showed that 
the  global  cloud  cover  pattern  exhibits  fractal  geometry  which  is  again  a 
signature  of  deterministic  chaos.  Phenomenological  observations  of  fractal 
(broken  or  fractured)  structure  in  nature  represent  the  two  fundamental 
symmetries  of  nature,  namely,  dilation  (r->br)  and  translation  (r->r+c)  and 
correspond  respectively  to  change  in  unit  of  length  or  in  the  origin  of  the  co-
ordinate  system  (Kadanoff,  1986).  A  selfsimilar  object  is  identified  by  its  fractal 
dimension D which is defined as dlnM(R)/dlnR where M(R) is the mass contained 
within  a  distance  R  from  a  typical  point  in  the  object.  The  basic  physical 
mechanism  of  the  observed  self-organized  fractal  geometry  in  nature  is  not  yet 
identified (Kadanoff, 1986).

Physics of Deterministic Chaos in the ABL 

The  period  doubling  route  to  chaos  is  basically  a  growth  phenomena  whereby 
large eddy growth is initiated from the turbulence scale in successive length step 
increments  equal  to  the  turbulence  scale  length  (Mary  Selvam,  1987).  In 
summary, turbulent eddies of frictional origin at the planetary surface possess an 
inherent  upward  momentum  flux  which  is  progressively  amplified  by  buoyant 
energy  generation  from  Microscale  Fractional  Condensation  (MFC)  of  water 
vapour  on  hygroscopic  nuclei  by  deliquescence  even  in  an  unsaturated 
environment  (Pruppacher  and  Klett,  1978).  The  exponential  decrease  of 
atmospheric density with height further accelerates the turbulence scale upward 
momentum  flux.  Therefore,  the  unidirectional  (upward)  turbulence  scale  energy 
pump generates successively larger vortex roll circulations in the ABL. The larger 
eddies carry the turbulent eddies as internal circulations which contribute to their 
(large eddies) further growth. Such a process of large eddy growth is analogous 
to  the  emission  of  anti-Stokes  laser  emission  triggered  by  laser  pump  during 
chaos in optics (Harrison and Biswas, 1986). 

Townsend  (1956)  has  investigated  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  large  eddy 
formations  in  turbulent  shear  flows  and  has  shown  that  large  eddies  of 
appreciable  intensity  form  as  a  chance  configuration  of  the  turbulent  motion  as 
illustrated  in  the  following  example.  Consider  a  large  eddy  of  radius  R  which 
forms in a field of isotropic turbulence with turbulence length and velocity scales 
2r and w respectively. The mean square circulation around a circulation path of 
large eddy radius R is given by 

where  w,  w1  are  the tangential  velocity  components  at  the positions  of  the path 
elements ds and ds1 . If the velocity product falls to zero while the separation ds 
and  ds1  is  still  small  compared  with  the  large  eddy  radius  R,  i.e.  the  motion  in 
sufficiently separated paths of flow is statistically independent

The  above  equation  can  be  applied  directly  to  derive  the  r.m.s.  circulation 
speed W of the large eddy of radius R generated by the turbulence scale energy 
pump. The scale ratio Z is equal to the ratio of the radii of the large and turbulent 
eddies.  The  environment  of  the  turbulent  eddy  is  a  region  of  buoyant  energy 
production  by  condensation  (in the  troposphere)  and is  therefore identified  by  a 
Microscale  Capping  Inversion  (MCI)  layer  on  the  large  eddy  envelope.  An 
incremental  growth  dR  of large  eddy radius equal  to  the  turbulent  eddy  radius r 
occurs  in  association  with  an  increase  dW  in  large  eddy  circulation  speed  as  a 
direct consequence of the buoyant vertical velocity w* production per second by 
MFC.  The  MCI  is  thus  a  region  of  wind  shear  and  temperature  inversion in  the 
ABL. The growth of large eddies from the turbulence scale at incremental length 
steps equal to r - turbulence length scale doubling - is therefore identified as the 
universal period doubling route to chaos in the ABL. 

Therefore,  considering  turbulence  scale  yardsticks  for  length  and  time,  large 
eddy growth occurs in discrete unit length steps during unit intervals of time and 
is analogous to ’cellular automata’ (Hayot, 1987) computational technique where 
microscopic  domain  processes  simulate  successfully  the  macroscale  flows  with 
simple  no  scale  (scale  invariant)  analytic  equations.  The  above  concept  of 
deterministic  chaos  is  also  a  ’randomly  exact’  method  of  determination  of 
macroscale flow characteristics which is conceived of as a space-time integrated 
mean  of  all inherent non-trivial  microscopic  domain  dynamical  processes and is 
therefore scale invariant. 

The physics of deterministic chaos therefore enables to identify turbulence as 
topology  dependent  and  intrinsic  to  boundary  layer  flows,  the  temperature 
inversion  and  wind  shear  being  manifestations  of  large  eddy  growth  from 
turbulent  energy  generation  processes.  This  concept  is  in  direct  contrast  to  the 
conventional  view  that  inversion  layers  act  as  atmospheric  lids  suppressing 
convective activity and that boundary layer turbulence, e.g. Clear Air Turbulence 
(CAT)  is  generated  by  wind  shear  in  inversion  layers,  the  index  of  such  shear 
produced turbulence being measured by the Richardson number (Holton, 1979).

Deterministic Chaos and Atmospheric Eddy Continuum 

The turbulent fluctuations mix overlying environmental air into the growing large 
eddy volume and the steady state non-dimensional fractional volume dilution k of 
the total large eddy volume across unit cross-section on its envelope is equal to

where  w*  is  the  bi-directional  turbulent  energy  acceleration  and  dW  the 
corresponding  acceleration  of  the  large  eddy  circulation  during  large  eddy 
incremental  length  step  growth  dR  equal  to  r.  From  Eq.(1)  it  may  be  computed 
and shown that k>0.5 for Z<10. Therefore organized large eddy growth can occur 
for  scale  ratios  Z>=10  only  since  dilution  by environmental  mixing  is  more  than 
half  by  volume  and  erases  the  signature  of  large  eddies  for  scale  ratios  Z<10. 
Therefore,  a  hierarchical,  scale  invariant,  selfsimilar  eddy  continuum  with  semi-
permanent  dominant  eddies  at  successive  decadic  scale  range  intervals  is 
generated by the self-organized period doubling route to chaos growth process. 
The large eddy circulation speed is obtained by integrating Eq.(2) for large eddy 
growth  from  the  turbulence  scale  energy  pump  at  the  planetary  surface  and  is 
given as

k=0.4 for Z=10 from Eqs.(1) and (2). Eq.(3) above is the well known logarithmic 
wind  profile  relationship  in  the  surface  ABL  and  k  is  designated  as  the  Von 
Karman’s constant and its value as determined from observations is equal to 0.4 
(Hogstrom, 1985). The deterministic chaos model for eddy dynamics in the ABL 
therefore  predicts  that  the  logarithmic  wind  profile  relationship  holds  good  not 
only for the surface friction layer, but throughout the ABL. Also, the Von Karman’s 
constant, an arbitrary constant of integration in conventional eddy diffusion theory 
(Holton,  1979)  and  determined  solely  by  observations  is  now  shown  to  have  a 
physical  meaning,  namely,  a  no  scale  (scale  invariant)  quantification  of  eddy 
mass exchange and therefore universal for all hydrodynamic boundary layer fluid 
flows irrespective of chemical composition and macroscopic size. Von Karman’s 
constant  k  is  therefore  more  universal  than  Feigenbaum’s  constants  for 
deterministic  chaos.  The  Feigenbaum’s  constants  for  deterministic  chaos  are 
shown in a later section to be functions of k and Z. 

Semi-permanent dominant eddies (limit cycles) in the ABL

The  convective,  meso-,  synoptic  and  planetary  scale  eddies  grow  from  the 
turbulence  scale  by  the  eddy  mixing  process  described  above  (Section  4.0)  at 
successive  decadic  scale  range  intervals.  The  inherent  hierarchy  of  the 
atmospheric  eddy  continuum  is  manifested  as  the  Meso-scale  Cloud  Clusters 
(MCC)  in  synoptic  scale  weather  systems.  The  relationship  between  the  radius 
(R),  time  period  (T),  circulation  velocity  (W)  and  energy  (E)  scales  of  the 
convective  (c),  meso-(m),  synoptic(s)  and  planetary  (p)  scale  atmospheric 
systems  to  the  primary  turbulence  scale  (r)  is  derived  from  Eq.(1)  and  is  given

The  sun  is  the  main  source  of  energy  which  drives  the  ABL  circulations  and 
therefore  periodicities  in  the  weather  patterns  may  finally  be  related  to  solar 

energy  input  cycles  as  shown  in  the  following  (1)  40-50  day  oscillations  in  the 
atmospheric general circulation and also the ENSO (≈ 5 years) phenomena may 
result  from  the  diurnal  cycle  of  solar  radiation  (1dayx40  ≈  40-50  days  and 
1dayx40x40  ≈  5years)  (2)  the  QBO  may  result  from  the  semi-diurnal  pressure 
oscillation  (12  hoursx40x40  ≈  2  years)  (3)  the  22  year  oscillation  in  weather 
patterns  may  result  from  the  5  minute  oscillations  of  the  sun’s  atmosphere 
(5minsx404 ≈ 22 years). 

A continuous periodogram analysis of high resolution surface pressure values 
may  be  used  to  determine  the  amplitude  and  phase  of  these  semi-permanent 
atmospheric  cycles  at  different  locations.  Eddy  energy  enhancement  at  any 
scale,  for  e.g.  the  CO2  related  green  house  warming  effect  in  the  convective 
scale  will  result  in  the  total  atmospheric  eddy  continuum  energy  enhancement 
(Eq.1)  which  may  be  manifested  (1)  in  the  synoptic  scale  features  as 
intensification  of  small  scale  short  duration  intense  weather  systems  such  as 
meso-cyclones  and  severe  local  storms.  In  general  seasonal/regional  weather 
anomalies will intensify as a result of tighter coiling of the circulation patterns e.g. 
the  prolonged  African drought,  erratic  monsoon  activity  and  abnormal  hurricane 
tracks.  (2)  in  the  planetary  scale  as  an  increase  in  the  spatial  and  temporal 
domain of the Hadley -Walker circulations with intensification of internal structure 
as  mentioned  at  (1)  above.  An  extension  of  temperate  rainfall  regime  to  higher 
latitudes possibly associated with CO2 related global warming has been reported. 
Further,  the  ENSO  phenomena  may  also  occur  with  the  shorter  period  of  the 
QBO.  Atmospheric  eddy  continuum  energy  enhancement  due  to  astronomical 
causes  or  human  activity  is  therefore  manifested  in  the  first  instance  as 
increased  variability  in  global  weather  patterns  leading  to  perceptible  climate 
impending 
change  after  an  appreciable 
weather/climate  change,  however  can  be  detected  in  the  geomagnetic  H 
component  variations  which  follow  closely  changes  in  atmospheric  circulation 
patterns as shown in a later section.

Deterministic Chaos and Coherent Helicity 

The  period  doubling  route  to  chaos  growth  process  therefore generates  a  scale 
invariant  eddy  continuum  where  eddy  energy  flow  structure  is  in  the  form  of 
nested logarithmic spiral vortex roll circulations, a complete circulation consisting 
of  the  outward  and  inherent  compensating  inward  flow.  The  region  of  chaos  is 
the  dynamic  growth  region  of  large  eddy  by  turbulence  scale  energy  pumping 
and  the  nested  vortex  hierarchical  continuum  energy  structure is  manifested  as 
the  strange  attractor  design  with  fractal  geometry.  The  atmospheric  circulation 
patterns,  therefore  have  fractal  dimensions  on  all  scales  ranging  from  the 
planetary to the turbulence scale, the strikingly visible pattern of fractal geometry 
being  exhibited  by  the  clouds.  The  above  concept  of  the  steady  state  turbulent 
atmospheric  boundary  layer  as  a  hierarchy  of  intrinsic  helical  fluctuations  is  in 
agreement  with  the  theoretical  investigations  of  hydrodynamical  turbulence  by 
Levich (1987). All basic meso-scale structures (less than 1000km in the tropics) 
appear  to  be  distinctly  helical.  These  include  such  outstanding  examples  of 
organized  geophysical  motion  as  medium  scale  tornado  generating  storms, 

squall  lines,  hurricanes,  etc.  (2)  Geophysical  flows  give  an  implicit  indication  of 
the  upscale    transfer  of  a  certain  amount  of  energy  inserted  at  much  smaller 
scales  (3)  the  helical  nature  of  the  most  violent  geophysical  phenomena  -  a 
supercell storm - is shown beyond any doubt (Lilly, 1986). 

The deterministic chaos model envisages the ABL flow to consist of a web of 
closed logarithmic spiral circulations anchored to the earth’s surface as a unified 
whole single extended object and having visible manifestation in cloud formation 
in  the  troposphere.  The  atmospheric  circulation  pattern  consisting  of  dominant 
eddies at decadic scale range intervals is analogous to (1) the superstrings of a 
10-dimensional  (Z=10)  Theory  of  Everything  (TOE)  (Fogleman,  1987)  (2)  the 
structured  quantized  vortex  roll  circulations  observed  in  superfluid  Helium 
(Mineev  et  al.,  1986)  and  is  also  similar  to  self-sustaining  solitons  or  solitary 
waves,  in  particular,  the  triple  soliton  (Tajima,  1987).  The  fractal  geometry  to 
cloud  pattern  results  from  the  space-time  integration  of  the  non-trivial  internal 
symmetries of the component turbulent eddies and is therefore a manifestation of 
supersymmetry in nature. 

The  fractal  dimension  D  of  clouds  may  be  expressed  as  D=dlnP/dlnZ  or 
D=dlnE/dlnZ  where  P  is  the  surface  pressure,  E  the  eddy  kinetic  energy  and  Z 
the normalised height. Therefore, the spectral slope of the eddy energy spectrum 
will be equal to the fractal dimension  D for the domain Z. 

The particles in the region of chaos follow laws analogous to Kepler’s third law 
of  planetary  motion  as  shown  in  the  following.  The  periods  T  and  t  of  the large 
and  turbulent  eddies  are  respectively  given  as  (2πR)/W    and      (2πr)/w  . 
Substituting for W/w from Eq.(1) gives

R3/T2  is  a  constant  for  constant  turbulence  scale  energy  pump  and  therefore 
large  eddy  circulations  follow  laws  analogous  to  Kepler’s  third  law  of  planetary 
motion.  The  planetary  motions  around  the  sun,  the  planetary  rings  around  the 
major  planets  and  the  large  atmospheric  vortices,  e.g.  polar  vortex  with 
structured  stratospheric  Ozone  concentration 
(Kerr,  1986)  may  all  be 
manifestations of deterministic chaos. 

The  rising  large  eddy  gets  progressively  diluted  by  vertical  mixing  due  to 
turbulent eddy fluctuations and a fraction f of surface air reaches the normalised 
height Z given by

The  steady  state  fractional  air  mass  flux  from  the  surface  is  dependent  only  on

5.1  Atmospheric eddy dynamics independent of Coriolis force 
Deterministic  chaos  model  for  atmospheric  eddy  dynamics  postulates  intrinsic 
helicity for the solar insolation related major atmospheric circulations as follows. 
The  major  planetary  scale  updraft  occurs  in  the  local  noon  time  tropical  region 
with  return  downdrafts  on  the  local  dawn  and  dusk  sectors  thereby  generating 
the semi-diurnal pressure oscillation. The air flow into the noon time low is from 
the  west  and  turning  anti-clockwise  (clockwise)  in  the  northern  (southern) 
hemispheres  because  of  intrinsic  spirality  of  eddy  structures  and  not  due  to 
Coriolis Force as is assumed generally in conventional meteorological theory. 

Deterministic Chaos and Quantum Mechanics 

6. 
The kinetic energy KE per unit mass of an eddy of frequency ν in the hierarchical 
eddy  continuum  is  shown  to  be  equal  to  Hν  where  H  is  the  spin  angular 
momentum  of  unit  mass  of  the  largest  eddy  in  the  hierarchy.  The  circulation 
speed of the largest eddy in the continuum is equal to the integrated mean of all 
the inherent turbulent eddy circulations. Let Wp be this mean circulation speed or 
the zero level about which all the larger frequency fluctuations occur. Therefore

H is equal to the product of the momentum of unit mass of planetary scale eddy 
and its radius and therefore represents the spin angular momentum of unit mass 
of  planetary  scale  eddy  about  the  eddy  center.  Therefore  the  kinetic  energy  of 
unit mass of any component eddy of frequency ν of the scale invariant continuum 
is  equal  to  Hν. Further,  since  the  large  eddy  is  but  the  sum  total  of  the  smaller 
scales,  the  large  eddy  energy  content  is  equal  to  the  sum  of  all  its  individual 
component  eddy  energies  and  therefore  the  kinetic  energy  KE  distribution  is 
normal and the kinetic energy KE of any eddy of radius R in the eddy continuum 
expressed as a fraction of the energy content of the largest eddy in the hierarchy 
will  represent  the  cumulative  normal  probability  density  distribution.  The  eddy 
continuum  energy  spectrum  is  therefore  the  same  as  the  cumulative  normal 
probability distribution plotted on a log-log scale and the eddy energy probability 
density  distribution  is  equal  to  the  square  of  the  eddy  amplitude.  Therefore  the 
atmospheric eddy continuum energy structure follows quantum mechanical laws. 
The energy manifestation of radiation and other subatomic phenomena appear to 
possess the dual nature of wave and particles since one complete eddy energy 
circulation  structure 
is  associated  with 
corresponding bimodal form of  manifested phenomena, e.g. formation of clouds 
in  the  updraft  regions  and  dissipation  of  clouds  in  the  downdraft  regions  giving 
rise to discrete cellular structure to cloud geometry.

Deterministic Chaos and Statistical Normal Distribution 

The  statistical  distribution  characteristics  of  natural  phenomena  follow  normal 
distribution  associated  conventionally  with  random  chance.  The  normal 
distribution is  characterized by  (1)  the  moment  coefficient of  skewness  equal to 
zero,  signifying  symmetry  and  (2)  the  moment  coefficient  of  kurtosis  equal  to  3 
representing intermittency of turbulence on relative time scale. In the following it 
is shown that the universal period doubling route to chaos growth phenomena in 
nature gives rise to to the observed statistical normal distribution parameters as a 
natural  consequence.  The  period  doubling  route  to  growth  is  initiated  and 
sustained  by  the  turbulent  (fine  scale)  eddy  acceleration  w*  which  then 
propagates by the inherent property of the inertia of the medium. In the context of 
atmospheric  turbulence,  the  statistical  parameters,  mean,  variance,  skewness 
and  kurtosis  represent  respectively  the  net  vertical  velocity,  intensity  of 
turbulence, vertical momentum flux and intermittency of turbulence and are given

since  large  eddy  growth  is  dependent  on  the  energy  input  from  the  turbulence 
scale  with  ordered  two-way  energy  feedback  between  the  larger  and  smaller 
scales. Feigenbaum’s (1980) research showed that the successive spacing ratios 
of  X  and  L  for  adjoining  period  doublings  are  given  respectively  by  the  two 
universal  constants  a=-2.5029  and  d=4.6692.  The  universal  constants  a  and  d 
assume  different  numerical  values  for  period  tripling,  quadrupling  etc.  and  the 
appropriate  values  are  computed  by  Delbourgo  (1986)  and  shown  to  follow  the 
relation 3d=2a2 over a wide domain.

The  physical  concept  of  large  eddy  growth  by  the  period  doubling  process 
enables to derive the universal constants a and d and their mutual relationship as 
functions inherent to the scale invariant eddy energy structure as follows.

a  is  therefore  equal  to  1/k  from  Eq.(2)  where  k  is  the  Von  Karman’s  constant 
representing  the  non-dimensional  steady  state  fractional  volume  dilution  rate  of 
large  eddy  by  turbulent  eddy  fluctuations  across  unit  cross-section  on  the  large 
eddy  envelope.  Therefore  ’a’  represents  the  non-dimensional  total  fractional 
mass  dispersion  rate  and  is  inherently  negative  and  2a2  represents  the  bi-
directional fractional energy flux into the large eddy environment. Let d represent 
the ratio of the spin angular moments for the total mass of the large and turbulent 
eddies.

Therefore 
  from  Eqs.(5)  and  (6).  The  above  equation 
relating  the  universal  constants  is  a  statement  of  the  law  of  conservation  of 
energy, i.e. the period doubling growth process generates a threefold increase in 
the spin angular momentum of the resulting large eddy and propagates outward 
as the total large eddy energy flux in the medium. In an earlier section (Section 7) 
it  was  shown  that  the  spin  angular  momentum  of  the  resulting  large  eddy 
accounts for the observed value of three for the moment coefficient of kurtosis of 
the normal distribution. The property of inertia enables propagation of turbulence 

scale perturbation in the medium by release of the latent energy potential of the 
medium.  An  illustrative  example  is  the  buoyant  energy  generation  by  water 
vapour condensation in the updraft regions in the ABL. 

The universal Feigenbaum’s constants a and d are respectively equal to -2.52 
and 4.05 as computed from Eqs.(5) and (6) since the scale ratio Z is equal to10 
for the self-organized eddy growth mechanism in the ABL.

Deterministic Chaos Model of Weather Systems 

The  atmospheric  weather  systems  are  the  visible  manifestation  of  the  unified 
atmospheric  eddy  continuum  in  climatologically  favourable  regions  of  enhanced 
buoyant  energy  generation.  The  hierarchical  helicity  inherent  to  the  turbulent 
shear flow of the ABL is  manifested as the Mesoscale Cloud Clusters (MCC) in 
global  weather  systems,  the  cloud  bands  having inherent  curvature  (helicity)  as 
exhibited  in  the  strikingly  spiral  hurricane  cloud  bands.  The  deterministic  chaos 
model  prediction  of  the  universal  and  unique  patterns  of  cloud  bands  and 
pressure  and  wind  anomaly  patterns  for  synoptic  scale  weather  systems  are 
compared  with  well  documented  observational  results  for  the  hurricane  system 
(Mary Selvam, 1986). The model concepts are given in the following. 

Since large eddy growth involves increase in radius simultaneous with angular 
displacement  from  origin,  the  trajectory  of  airflow  associated  with  the  large 
eddies  will  follow  a  logarithmic  spiral  pattern  both  in  the  horizontal  and  vertical. 
The  complete  eddy  circulation  consisting  of  the  ascent  and  the  return  descent 
airflow  therefore  occurs  in  the  form  of  logarithmic  spiral  vortices.  The  full 
continuum of atmospheric eddies exist as a unified whole in the form of vortices 
within  vortices  as displayed in  the  extreme  cases  of  the tornado  funnel  and the 
dust  devil.  Large  eddy  growth  is  initiated  at  a  single  point  location  and  growth 
occurs  in  a  spiral  wave  form  analogous  to  the  self-organized  Belousov-
Zabotinsky  (Ananthakrishnan,  1986)  reaction  in  chemical  systems.  In  the 
following,  quantitative  relations  are  derived  for  cloud  parameters  as  simple 
analytic  equations  from  considerations  of  the  microscopic  scale  dynamics.  The 
angular  rotation  θd
  per 
second at any location (R, θ ) is given as

eddy and the circle drawn with radius R is given by 

 

 

substituting  b=tanα  and  integrating  for  eddy  growth  from  r  to  R,  the  above 
equation gives

This is the equation for an equiangular logarithmic spiral when the crossing angle 
α  is  a  constant.  At  any  location  A,  the  horizontal  air  flow  path  into  the  eddy 
continuum system follows a logarithmic spiral track. 

9.1  Storm intensity and cloud band configuration 
The cloud bands identify the circulation path of the synoptic cyclonic eddy whose 
radial  growth  dR  is  equal  to  the  dominant  turbulent  eddy  radius  and  dθ  is  the 
corresponding angular rotation.

The  dominant  turbulent  eddy  radius  determines  the  angular  turning  dθ  and 
incremental  large  eddy  growth  dR  and  therefore  the  synoptic  scale  spiral  cloud 
band  has  different  crossing  angles  and  band  widths  at  different  locations,  with 
respect  to  the  storm  center.  Observations  show  that  increased  condensation 
results  in  decrease  in  dominant  turbulent  eddy  radius.  There  is  heavy 
condensation  close  to  the  storm  center  in  association  with  tighter  coiling  of  the 
spiral with overlapping cloud bands.

9.3  Horizontal profile of hurricane pressure field 
The low pressure field of the cyclone system is created by the upward ascent of 
surface air. At any location distance R from the storm center there is an upward 
mass flux of air equal to w*r per second across unit area where r is the air density 
and  w*  is  the  buoyant  vertical  velocity  generated  per  second  by  Microscale 
Fractional  Condensation  (MFC)  at  surface  layers.  A  synoptic  scale  weather 
system  which  has  been  in  existence  for  a  time  period  TN  and  extending  to  a 
radial  distance  RN  develops  a  central  pressure  departure  equal  w*rTN  with 
respect  to  the  ambient  pressure  field  at  the  periphery  (X).  At  any  intermediate 
location (say B) the corresponding pressure departure is equal to w*rTR where TR 
is  the  time  period  for  the  eddy  to  grow  from  B  to  X.  The  Normalised  Pressure 
Departure  (NPD)  at  the  intermediate  location  with  respect  to  the  extreme 
pressure gradient at the storm center is computed as

9.4  Horizontal profile of wind 
The horizontal profile of wind (W) in a cyclone system follows the logarithmic law 
and depends only on the turbulent eddy radius from Eq.(3). The airflow speed is 
mainly  due  to  the  dynamic  buoyant  energy  production  by  MFC  and  thus  is  not 
influenced  by  the  rotation  of  the  earth.  Therefore  the  Coriolis  force  does  not 
influence  the  airflow  into  the  synoptic  scale  eddy  as  explained  earlier.  The 
universal  and  unique  pressure  and  wind  anomaly  patterns  for  the  hurricane 
system  is  in  agreement  with  reported  observations  of  Holland  (1980),  Simpson 
and Riehl (1981) and others. 

9.5  Quantum mechanics and atmospheric weather systems 
The  quantum  reality  which  underlies  the  real  world  may  now  be  pictured  in  the 
context  of  the  universal  theory  of  chaos  as  applied  to  the  macroscale 
cloud/weather  systems  in  the  ABL  and  may  possibly  provide  physically 
inconsistencies  and 
for 
consistent  commonplace  solutions 
paradoxes  (Herbert,  1987)  of  the  quantum  mechanics  as  follows.  The  unified 
atmospheric  eddy  continuum  with  its  complete  helical  vortex  roll  circulation 
consists of balanced and instantaneously adjusting high and low pressure areas 
of  cloud  dissipation  and  formation  respectively  and  may  therefore  provide  the 
physical  analogue  for  (1)  wave-particle  dulaity  (2)  non-locality-Berry’s  phase  (3) 
ultra metric space in sub-atomic particle dynamics.

9.6  Cloud dynamics, microphysics and electrification 
Cloud  growth  occurs  in  the  updraft  regions  of  large  eddy  circulations  under 
favourable  conditions  of  moisture  supply  in  the  environment.  The  turbulent 
eddies  inherent  to  the  large  eddies  are  amplified  inside  the  clouds  due  to 
enhanced  cloud  water  condensation  and  form  "cloud  top  gravity  (buoyancy) 
oscillations".  The  cloud  top  gravity  oscillations  are  responsible  for  (1)  cloud 
vertical mixing and dilution. Downward transport of stratospheric ozone may also 
occur  in  deep  convective  systems  as  reported  by  several  workers  (2)  cloud 
electrification  by  downward  transport  of  naturally  occurring  negative  space 
charges from above cloud top regions to the cloud base and simultaneously the 
upward transport of positive space charges from lower troposphere to the cloud 
top regions thereby generating the observed vertical positive dipole cloud charge. 
The Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (TIDS) have been attributed to cloud top 
gravity  oscillations  in  deep  convective  systems.  The  cauliflower-like  surface 
granularity  to  the  cumulus  cloud  is  a  signature  of  the  innumerable  turbulent 
eddies which form the cloud top gravity oscillations. 

The  deterministic  chaos  model  enables  universal  no  scale  (scale  invariant) 
quantification  of  the  steady  state  cloud  dynamical,  microphysical  and  electrical 
processes (Mary Selvam and Murty, 1985) as listed in the following. (1) The ratio 
of  the  actual  cloud  liquid  water  content  (q)  to  the  adiabatic  liquid  water  content 
(qa) is equal to f, the fraction of surface air which reaches the normalised height Z 
after dilution by vertical mixing due to turbulent eddy fluctuations (2) the vertical 
profiles  of  the  vertical  velocity W  and  the  total  cloud  liquid  water  content  qt  are 
respectively given by W=w*fZ and  qt=q*fZ where t represents the total values and

where  li  is

occurring  Junge  aerosol  size  spectrum  and  (5)  the  computed  raindrop  size 
the  observed  Marshall-Palmer  raindrop  size 
spectrum  closely  resembles 
distribution  at  the  surface  (6)  the  electric  field  at  the  surface  due  to  the  cloud 
dipole  charge,  the  strength of  the  cloud dipole,  the  cloud  electrical  conductivity, 
the point discharge current are expressed in terms of the basic non-dimensional 
parameters f and Z. The above quantitative relations are universal for all clouds 
and depends only on the scale ratio Z. 

10.  Deterministic Chaos, Atmospheric Electric Field and 
Geomagnetic Field 

Numerous  studies  indicate  significant  correlation  between  geomagnetic  field 
variations  and  tropospheric  weather  activity  (Herman  and  Goldberg,  1978; 
Gribbins,  1981;  Courtillot  et  al.,  1982;  Kalinin  and  Rozanova,  1984;  Taylor, 
1986).  However,  the  exact  physical  mechanism  for  the  observed  coupling 
between meteorological and geomagnetic phenomena is not yet identified. It may 
be shown that the atmospheric electric field and geomagnetic field variations are 
manifestations  of  the  vertical  mass  exchange  process  between  the  lower 
troposphere  and  ionosphere.  The  vertical  mass  exchange  gives  rise  to  upward 
transport  of  naturally  occurring  positive  space  charges  from  surface  layers  and 
simultaneous downward transport of negative space charges from higher levels. 
The  eddy  circulations  therefore  generate  a  large  scale  vertical  aerosol  current 
which is of the correct sign and magnitude to generate the horizontal component 
of the geomagnetic field (Mary Selvam, 1987). Therefore atmospheric circulation 
patterns  leave  signature  on  the  geomagnetic  field  lines  whose  global  variations 
can be easily monitored by satellite borne sensors and thus assist in weather and 
climate prediction. 

Conclusion 

The  deterministic  chaos  model  for  atmospheric  weather  systems  enables  to 
formulate governing equations for pressure and wind anomaly patterns in terms 
of  no  scale  (scale  invariant)  quantities  by  consideration  of  microscopic  scale 
dynamical  processes  and 
’cellular  automata’ 
computational  technique.  Parallel  processing  computers  or  microprocessors  at 
different  locations  can  be  used  to  compute  real  time  horizontal  and  vertical 
profiles of meteorological parameters for global weather systems.

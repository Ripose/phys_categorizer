Abstract

In a recent publication (Telhat Özdogan, Int. J. Quantum Chem., 92 (2003) 419), we presented a 

unified algorithm for the evaluation of multicenter multielectron integrals over Slater type 

orbitals with noninteger principal quantum numbers, using the one center expansion formula for 

Slater type orbitals with integer principal quantum numbers (E. Öztekin et. all., J. Mol. Struct. 

Theochem, 544 (2001) 69; I.I. Guseinov et all., Z. Struct. Khim., 23 (1987) 148 (in Russian)). 

Guseinov in his comment (arXiv-physics/0510235) on our publication claims that the presented 

formulae in our paper could be derived from formulae in his papers by simple algebra. We give a 

brief response to some of his claims wherever scientifically appropriate. We also assert that the 

comments are not scientifically justified and rhetoric is highly inappropriate. It should be noted 

also that it is not easy to understand that what Guseinov intends to do by transforming our 

procedure into his procedure, which we don't evaluate as a development but can be regarded as 

a nice sound of science.

KEY WORDS: Slater-type orbital, nuclear attraction integral, Legendre function. 

AMS subject classification: 81-08,81-V55,81V45

In the comment of I.I. Guseinov [1], it is claimed that the formulae we presented in our 

recent paper [2] are derived from the relationships in his studies [3], by changing the summation 

indices.

As can be seen from our paper [2] that the early work of Guseinov [4] (cited as Ref. 19 in 

our paper [2]) is cited in constructing our procedure. It is understood that Guseinov do not read our 

papers, He just write comments as he always does.

The   constructed  formulae   in  our   recent   paper   [2]   is   used   in   the   evaluation  of   arbitrary 

multielectron multicenter molecular integrals over Slater type orbitals with noninteger principal

quantum numbers and can be understand clearly. That is, the expressions for multielectron integrals 

over   Slater   type   orbitals   with   noninteger   principal   quantum   numbers   have   been   obtained 

independently, not by changing the summation indices of the formulae in papers by Guseinov. The 

efficiency and accuracy of our algorithm is tested for a wide range of molecular parameters. It is seen 

that the algorithm presented here for the calculation of arbitrary multielectron multicenter molecular 

integrals for noninteger n-Slater type orbitals is the first in the literature, efficient and can be used in 

molecular structure calculations without loss of significant figures as occur in some weak methods, 

especially   by   Guseinov   [5].   It   is   advised   to  read  the   excellent   paper   of   Barnett  [6]   for   digital 

erosion may occur in methods by Guseinov [5] and others.

Guseinov causes misunderstanding for readers and publishers by citing his comments but 

hiding   our   replies.   He   should   be   warned   by   readers   and   publishers   for   this   ethical   problem. 

Therefore,   we   advise   to   see   our   replies   to   his   unjust   comments   in   the   link   below:

this   manner,   we   advise   readers   to 

communicate with me!!!

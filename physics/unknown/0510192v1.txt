The aim of this article is to provide a complete analysis of the behavior of a noncontact atomic force
microscope ~NC-AFM!. We start with a review of the equations of motion of a tip interacting with
a surface in which the stability conditions are ﬁrst revisited for tapping mode. Adding the equations
of automatic gain control ~AGC!, which insures constant amplitude of the oscillations in the
NC-AFM, to the equations of motion of the tip, a new analytical stability criterion that involves
proportional and integral gains of AGC is deduced. Stationary solutions for the shift of frequency
and for the damping signal are obtained. Special attention is paid to the damping signal in order to
clarify its physical origin. The theoretical results are then compared to those given by a virtual
machine. The virtual machine is a set of equations solved numerically without any approximation.
The virtual machine is of great help in understanding the dynamical behavior of the NC-AFM as
images are recorded. Transient responses of the shift in frequency and of the damping signal are
discussed in relation to the values of proportional and integral gains of AGC.

I. INTRODUCTION

The noncontact atomic force microscope ~NC-AFM! is a
powerful tool with which to investigate surface properties at
the nanometer scale. Contrast at the atomic scale has been
achieved for semiconductors and insulators.1– 6 The NC-
AFM is also a powerful tool with which to investigate soft
materials.7 Albretch et al. were the ﬁrst to propose the con-
cept of a NC-AFM.8 In the NC-AFM, the tip–cantilever is in
a closed loop and the frequency of the oscillations depends
on tip–surface interaction. The amplitude of the oscillations
is kept constant by automatic gain control ~AGC!. The damp-
ing signal, which is the signal of error of AGC, should nor-
mally be a good measure of the dissipative term involved in
tip–surface interaction. The question of the physical origin
of the variation of the damping signal remains unresolved
and has been a matter of debate over the last few years.9–13
This point is of great importance because the damping signal
should provide information on dynamical properties at the
molecular scale. With the development of dynamic force mi-
croscopy ~DFM!, in tapping or noncontact mode, numerous
theoretical work14 –19 has been devoted to a description of the
dynamical behavior of an oscillating tip–cantilever system
~OTCS! in proximity to a surface. Analytical solutions and
numerical results predict and show stable and unstable do-
mains of the resonance peak in tapping mode, i.e., when the
OTCS is excited by a constant driving force. Theoretical

predictions are widely conﬁrmed by experimental results.20
However, it is not clear whether the NC-AFM can be under-
stood by extrapolating theoretical results obtained by assum-
ing a constant driving force like done in tapping mode. Un-
like tapping mode, NC-AFM mode looks very stable: the
phase of the OTCS may be adjusted at any value around
2p/2 whereas theoretical results predict instability for phase
larger than 2p/2 in tapping mode.

To understand a NC-AFM machine, we need to add the
equations that rule AGC to the equations of motion of the
OTCS. This article is organized as follows. In Sec. II, the
equations of motion of the OTCS without AGC and the sta-
bility criterion are reviewed. In Sec. III, the equations that
rule AGC are added to the equations of motion of the OTCS
in order to establish the domain of stability. We show that
noncontact mode is stable as long as proportional and inte-
gral gains of AGC satisfy three inequalities. The stationary
solutions for the shift of frequency and for the damping sig-
nal versus the tip–surface distance are also established for
any value of the phase of the OTCS. Theoretical results are
obtained with some minor approximations, and the predic-
tions are compared to the results given by the virtual NC-
AFM machine. The virtual machine is made of a set of non-
linear differential equations solved numerically without any
approximation; this machine is a model of the machine used
in our laboratory and also in most other laboratories. The
virtual machine can calculate the transient response of the
shift in frequency and of the damping signal when nondissi-
pative or/and dissipative force is introduced into tip–surface
interaction. Transient responses are strongly related to pro-
portional and integral gains of AGC and may lead, in some

artifacts are thus discussed at the end of the article.

II. BEHAVIOR OF AN OSCILLATING TIP EXCITED BY
CONSTANT DRIVING FORCE: TAPPING MODE

Here in Sec. II, we brieﬂy recall the main results for an
oscillating tip close to a surface. In so-called tapping mode,
oscillations of the tip are driven by an external force at a
given frequency.

The differential equation that describes motion z(t) of

the tip is given by

ing coefﬁcient. F ext(t)5F 0 cos(vt) is the external driving
force, and V int@z(t)# is the interaction potential between the
tip and the surface. In this article, we assume ~i! that the tip
never touches the surface and ~ii! van der Waals sphere–

where H, R, and D are the Hamaker constant, the tip’s apex

ticular potential does not restrict the validity of the results
discussed in this article.

To solve the nonlinear differential, Eq. ~1!, we used the
principle of least action, so we start by building the Lagrang-

III. BEHAVIOR OF AN OSCILLATING TIP KEPT AT
CONSTANT AMPLITUDE: NONCONTACT MODE

A. Equations of motion

First, we will brieﬂy recall the principle of the NC-AFM.
A simpliﬁed schematic diagram of the microscope is given in
Fig. 2~a!. The OTCS is in a closed loop and the amplitude of
the oscillations is adjusted by A 0 and is kept at a constant
level by AGC. The so-called damping signal D amp is the
signal of error of AGC. k 1 (in N V21) and k 2 (in V m21) are
the apparatus’ functions of cantilever piezo and of optical
detection, respectively. The frequency of oscillations of the
loop is measured by a quadrature frequency demodulator.
The phase shift network ~f! and the gain G are adjusted to
satisfy the Barkhausen criterion28 at the oscillation frequency
selected, in other words, the gain in open loop is equal to
unity at the frequency of the oscillations. Thus, one way to
understand the stability in noncontact mode is to study the
OCTS feedback through AGC as shown in Fig. 2~b!. The
equations that rule the OCTS are identical to Eqs. ~4!, except
the excitation F 0 is now replaced by the product

pletely reasonable.

conversely, sweeping from low to high values gives jumps of
Z ms and u
s from B to D. These jumps have been already
observed in tapping mode by various authors.15,20,27

Curve a and the x axis in Fig. 3 delineate the stability
domain when distance D is inﬁnite and u51. The system
would be stable if the P and I gains are chosen inside the
hatched zone in Fig. 3. When adiabatic conditions are ful-
ﬁlled, the stationary solutions of the shift in frequency and of
the damping signal do not depend on the pair ( P – I); see, for
instance, Eqs. ~17! and ~19! below. When the adiabatic con-
ditions are not satisﬁed, the choice of pair ( P – I) is of great
importance because transient responses of the shift in fre-
quency and of the damping signal depend on the gain in P
and I. Unfortunately, Eqs. ~8!, ~10!, and ~11! indicate that it
is not easy to obtain a criterion that could help the user
choose the gain in P and I. The virtual machine becomes of
some help in investigating this point as we will see in Sec.
IV.

As shown in Fig. 3,

the stability domain becomes
smaller and smaller when the tip–surface distance D de-
creases; curves b, c, and d are calculated for three different
values of D and u, respectively @in the NC-AFM the quanti-
ties D and u are closely related, Eq. ~17!#. Special attention
has to be paid to the NC-AFM where P and I gains are
usually adjusted for an inﬁnite tip–surface distance D, since
approaching the surface may lead to instabilities ~Sec. IV!.

B. Shift in frequency and damping signal in the
NC-AFM

Assuming there is a couple ( P – I) inside the stability
domain, it is now possible to write the shift in frequency D f
and the damping signal, the two experimental quantities re-
corded in NC-AFM mode.

D f 5v

Under steady state conditions, the shift in frequency
0/2p(u21)5 f 0(u21) is deduced from Eqs. ~12!:

Equation ~16! is obtained by assuming that (12u 2)
’2(12u), i.e., u’1 in Eqs. ~12!. This approximation is
reasonable since in many cases D f / f 0 is much less than
1023. The magnitude of the shift in frequency depends on
tip–surface interaction and it is weakly dependent on phase
s as long as cot(u

~dashed curve a!.

From Eq. ~17!, it appears that the high sensitivity of the
NC-AFM is not related to the high value of Q as is some-
times mentioned in the literature. However, the phase noise
density of the loop varies as 1/Q 2, 29 so a high value of Q is
required to obtain good resolution in the NC-AFM. At this
stage, we have to point out that the sensitivity is also depen-
dent on the bandwidth B of the frequency demodulator; a
small value of B reduces the noise but, as usual, slows down
the dynamical response of the frequency demodulator.

For Q52g52(g
0 the damping coefﬁ-
0
cient when D!‘ and g
int the damping coefﬁcient related to
tip–surface interaction, respectively, it is clear that the damp-
ing signal appears to be a good measure of the dissipative
term of tip–surface interaction. However, the damping signal
in Eq. ~19! is also frequency dependent through the u term.
Thus, a change in the nondissipative term of tip–surface in-
teraction leads also to a change in damping signal:
5Du/u. In order to avoid any ambiguity about
DD amp /D amp
the dissipative term of tip–surface interaction, the damping
signal has to be treated simultaneously with the shift in fre-
quency signal.

Equations ~17! and ~19! are established by assuming that
steady state conditions are fully satisﬁed; these equations
give no information about dynamical solutions. From a prac-
tical point of view, the steady state conditions require an
inﬁnitely slow sweep rate. If the steady state conditions are
not fully satisﬁed, the D f and D amp signals depend on pro-
portional P and integral I gains of AGC. The set of equa-
tions, Eqs. ~8!, ~10!, and ~11!, has no analytical solution. As
an alternative to this problem, a virtual NC-AFM machine
helps to evaluate oscillation behavior that cannot be ac-
counted for by the steady state approximation. Both virtual
and hardware machines can be represented in block diagram
form as shown in Fig. 2~a!. The hardware NC-AFM machine

is a hybrid machine made of a Digital Instruments head and
~Nanoscope E!30 and Omicron electronics
a controller
~AFMCU!.31 The commercial Digital Instruments machine
was modiﬁed for use in noncontact mode. For more details
concerning the virtual machine, see Ref. 13.

The virtual machine is in fact a set of differential equa-
tions that describe each block in Fig. 2~a!. The set of equa-
tions is numerically solved without any approximation.

The OTCS is still described by Eq. ~1!. The peak detec-
tor in Omicron electronics is made of a rectifying diode, a
R – C circuit, and a ﬁrst-order low pass ﬁlter. For simplicity a
quadratic detector and a second-order low pass ﬁlter are used
in the virtual machine. The output V(t) of the peak detector
is given by

However a compromise has to be found between the magni-

Virtual and hardware AGC are described by Eqs. ~9! and

The set of equations, Eqs. ~1!, ~9!, ~20!, ~21!, and ~23!, is
numerically solved using the Simulink tool box in Matlab
and a Runge–Kutta method, the ﬁxed step size Dt used for
the calculations being about 2p/(70v

lation in the closed loop, a very short pulse is applied at the

A. Shift in frequency and damping signal with the
NC-AFM virtual machine

Curves b in Figs. 4~a! and 4~b! are the shift in frequency
and the damping signal versus distance D, respectively. The
approach rate is slow, about 1.2 nm s21, in order to keep the
system under adiabatic conditions. These curves have to be
compared to the theoretical curves ~a! obtained from Eqs.
~17! and ~19!. The damping signal becomes unstable when
distance D is less than ’15.2 nm @see the inset in Fig. 4~b!#.
515.1 nm and the P
Parameter A 0 was adjusted to obtain Z ms
and I gains were set to 60 and 35 000, respectively. The limit
of stability calculated with the virtual machine is in good
agreement with the theoretical results in Sec. III. From the
curves in Fig. 3, the limit of stability is found at about 15.17
nm.

The inset in Fig. 4~a! shows that the shifts in frequency
given by the virtual machine and by Eq. ~17! are in good
agreement as long as the shift in frequency is less than about
200 Hz. For shifts in frequency larger than 200 Hz, i.e., for
distance D very close to the amplitude Z ms of the oscillation,
the difference between the theoretical predictions ~curve a!
and the virtual machine ~curve b! becomes more and more
pronounced. Two reasons can explain the difference between
curves b and a.
~1! The smaller the (D2Z ms) distance, the larger the shift in
frequency, and approaching the surface makes the rate of
change of instantaneous frequency of the loop very
large. The virtual machine uses a quadrature frequency
demodulator with 455 kHz intermediary frequency, the
same as that is used by Omicron.31 Thus the output sig-
nal of the frequency demodulator has a rise time, t
r , that
is directly related to the bandwidth B of measurement,
t
the frequency de-
r
modulator cannot follow an instantaneous change of
frequency.

51/2pB’1 ms. Consequently,

~2! The damping instability leads to an abrupt change in
frequency. This can be understood with the help of
curves b, c, and d and the horizontal line D in Fig. 1~b!.
If the damping signal becomes unstable, the amplitude of
the oscillations is no longer constant and, because phase
uis kept constant, the frequency changes, in agreement
with Fig. 1~b!, where the horizontal line D is the locus of
the quiescent point for the OTCS. Qualitatively, one can
interpret the concomitant change in frequency as fol-
lows: while the phase remains constant, as indicated by
the D line, the AGC loop is unable to keep the oscillation
amplitude constant. Because of
the oscillation
reaches another state that corresponds to a transient
value of the oscillation amplitude and, consequently, an-
other value of the shift in resonance frequency. The fre-

this,

quency instabilities are unambiguously observed close to
15.2 nm @inset in Fig. 4~a!#. There is a strong correlation
between the instabilities of the damping signal and those
of the frequency. In conclusion, without fully rejecting
point ~1!, we suggest that the main reason for the differ-
ence between curves a and b is the decrease in amplitude
of the oscillations which is related to instability of the
system. The correlation between the damping and the
frequency shift instabilities has already been observed in
NC-AFM experiments.32

The virtual machine is now used to investigate the case
where the adiabatic conditions are not satisﬁed. As men-
tioned in Sec. III, the shift in frequency and the damping
signal now become dependent on the P and I gain. Two
stimuli are successively applied to the cantilever: ~i! a non-
dissipative force step and ~ii! a dissipative force step. For
each step, two pairs of P and I gains are chosen, denoted P 1
and P 2 in Fig. 3. These two points are inside the stability
domain. We want to learn more about the behavior of the
machine when small, but fast, perturbation is applied. The
distance and the set point amplitude are D515.4 nm and
515.1 nm, respectively, thus the stability domain is still
Z ms
very close to the hatched zone in Fig. 3.

B. Transient responses to a nondissipative force step

50.

A Heaviside function that describes a variation in the
step of the Hamaker constant H is applied, with the step
magnitude DH 1% of the initial value of H. For such a step,
the frequency of the loop instantaneously changes. Curves a
and b in Fig. 5~a! are the shifts in frequency for two pairs of
values ( P – I), respectively. As expected the gains in P and I
have no effect on the variation of the shift in frequency. The
output of the demodulator is only determined by its band-
width, thus it exhibits a delay response for time t
’1 ms.

Curve c gives the instantaneous response @Eq. ~17!# that cor-
responds to an ‘‘ideal’’ machine with t
r

Curves a and b in Fig. 5~b! are the damping signal for
the pairs P 1 and P 2 , respectively; curve c is again the re-
sponse of an ideal machine @Eq. ~19!#. A high value of P and
of I, like in curve b, leads to weakly damped oscillatory
behavior of the damping signal whereas a single overshoot is
observed for small values of P and I, so P 1 is more suitable
in the case of a nondissipative force step. However, it is
worth noting that the overshoot, although being spread over
quite a large time scale ~a few ms!, remains negligible, about
1024 of the initial damping value, which corresponds to ad-
ditional dissipated energy of 1.9310222 J (1024 k cZ ms
2 /Q
515.1 nm, and Q54750). Such
with k c
variation cannot be observed except if the experiment is per-
formed at temperature lower than about 10 K (kT51.38
310222 J at 10 K!.

C. Transient responses to a dissipative force step

The dissipative force step is obtained by using a Heavi-
side function for the gcoefﬁcient. Curves a and b in Fig. 6~a!
are the damping signals for the pairs ( P – I), respectively.
Curve c is for an ideal machine, given by Eq. ~19!. The

FIG. 5. Transient responses of the shift in frequency and damping signal for
a nondissipative force step. Curves a and b are obtained for P520, I
51000 and P560, I535 000, respectively; curves c are given by Eqs. ~17!
and ~19!.

transient response of the damping signal has the same fea-
tures as those above; high values of P and I lead to weakly
damped oscillatory behavior ~curve b! whereas a single over-
shoot is observed for small values of P and I ~curve a!.

Under steady state conditions, the shift in frequency can-
not be related to the dissipation term @curve c in Fig. 6~a!#.
The shift in frequency remains constant @Eq. ~17!#. Curves a
and b are the shifts in frequency given by the virtual ma-
chine. Small values of P and I, like in curve a, lead to large
variation of the frequency. This behavior is still consistent
with the explanations provided in ~2! in Sec. IV A, where the
change in frequency is induced by the amplitude of the os-
cillations not being kept constant because AGC is not able to
correct amplitude ﬂuctuations quickly enough. Therefore, the
P 2 would be more appropriate in the case of a dissipative
force step to avoid misinterpretation about the shift in fre-
quency of the signal.

These two examples show that it is not very easy to
separate contributions of dissipative and nondissipative force
if adiabatic conditions are not satisﬁed; there is no ideal
value for the gains in P and I. However, these two examples
can be used as a guide to avoid misinterpretation when using
the NC-AFM.

The stability domain given by the virtual machine and theo-
retical results are in good agreement. We have also explained
the correlation between the oscillations of the damping sig-
nal and those of the shift in frequency.

In scanning or approach–retract mode, on which adia-
batic conditions are seldom satisﬁed, it is of primary impor-
tance to characterize the dynamical behavior of the NC-
AFM, which depends on proportional P and integral I gains.
Starting from the equations of motion of the OTCS and the
equations of CAG, it is rather difﬁcult to obtain information
about the dynamical behavior. An alternative to this problem
is use of the virtual machine which is a very powerful tool
with which to study, for instance, transient responses of the
shift in frequency and the damping signal. We have shown
that a step of nondissipative force gives an unexpected
change in the damping signal; conversely, a step of dissipa-
tive force gives an unexpected change in frequency. In both
cases, the transient responses are completely inﬂuenced by
the choice of proportional P and integral I gains of CAG.
There is no ideal value for the pair ( P – I), so care has to be
taken in interpreting transient responses of the shift in fre-
quency and damping signal.

V. DISCUSSION

By solving the equations of motion of the OTCS and
those of CAG and using the Routh–Hurwitz criterion, we
showed that the NC-AFM is stable if proportional P and
integral I gains are inside the stability domain. The stability
domain is strongly dependent on tip–surface interaction.
Only pure van der Waals attractive interaction was consid-
ered here, but the method is valid for any kind of interaction.
Also deduced from the equations of motion of the OTCS
were the shift in frequency and the so-called damping signal
under steady state conditions. It was shown that the shift in
frequency is related only to nondissipative force if the phase
of the OTCS is 2p/2. The damping signal depends on losses
of the cantilever but it is also dependent on the frequency of
the loop, so special attention has to be paid to interpreting
this signal to avoid misinterpretation.

To validate theoretical results, which were obtained us-
ing some minor approximations, a virtual NC-AFM machine
was built. The virtual machine, which is identical to a hard-
ware machine, is in fact a set of differential equations solved
numerically without any approximating. The shift in fre-
quency and damping signal given by the virtual machine in
approach–retract mode are in good agreement with the the-
oretical results as long as conditions of stability are satisﬁed.

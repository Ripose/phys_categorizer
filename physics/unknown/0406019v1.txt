We demonstrate analytically and numerically that focusing of high harmonics produced by the
reﬂection of a few femtosecond laser pulse from a concave plasma surface opens a new way towards
unprecedentally high intensities. The key features allowing for boosting of the focal intensity is
the harmonic coherency and the small exponent of the power-law decay of the harmonic spectrum.
Using the similarity theory and direct particle-in-cell simulations we ﬁnd that the intensity at the
Coherent Harmonic Focus (CHF) scales as ICHF ∝ a3
0 are the dimensionless
relativistic amplitude and the intensity of the incident laser pulse. The scaling suggests that due to
the CHF, the Schwinger intensity limit can be achieved using lasers with I0 ≈ 1022 W/cm2. The
pulse duration at the focus scales as τCHF ∝ 1/a2

0 and reaches the subattosecond range.

The advent of the Chirped Pulse Ampliﬁcation (CPA)
technique [1] was the technological breakthrough leading
to a dramatic increase in the achievable laser powers and
intensities [2]. The higher laser intensities mean also the
higher laser electric ﬁelds. As a result, the continuous
technological progress has allowed for laboratory studies
of the ever new physics, from the strong ﬁeld laser-atom
interactions [3], up to the ultra-relativistic laser-plasmas
[4] and the high-energy particle acceleration [5]. This
physics is of interest, because it studies non-linear prop-
erties of matter in the ultra-strong laser ﬁelds.

−

One may ask a question, whether the intensity can
be reached that allows studying non-linear properties of
one of the most intriguing media: of vacuum itself. It is
known, that vacuum is in fact not empty. It is ﬁlled with
virtual particles. The lightest charged particles partici-
pating in the electromagnetic interactions are electrons
and positrons. They continuously appear and disappear
in vacuum on distances of the order of the Compton
wavelength λC = ~/mc. Quantum electrodynamics sug-
gests that there exists a very fundamental critical value
of the electric ﬁeld: EQED = m2c3/e~ = 1.3
1016 V/cm,
here m and
e are the electron mass and charge re-
spectively. An electric ﬁeld with the strength EQED ac-
complishes the work eEQEDλC = mc2 on the Compton
distance and thus is able to bring these pairs from the
virtual realm into the real world. The vacuum gets
polarized and its response becomes highly non-linear.
The critical ﬁeld EQED is known as the Schwinger limit
[6]. The corresponding laser intensity IQED can be eas-
ily calculated: IQED = cE2
1029 W/cm2.
To realize, how huge this value is, let us suppose one
wishes to reach the IQED intensity by focusing an ultra-
short laser pulse down to the λ3 volume [7], where λ is
the laser wavelength. Then, the laser energy must be
W = 4πIQEDλ3/3c = 6.4
107 J(λ/µm)3. For a laser with
1µm this would mean a 64 MJ pulse energy, which
λ
is hardly feasible in the foreseen future.

of theoretical analysis and direct particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations that the Schwinger limit can be achieved at
reasonable laser pulse energies using the existing or just
emerging laser technology.

The basic idea of harmonic focusing is to take an ini-
tial laser pulse with the wavelength λ0, send it through
a nonlinear medium, generate n high harmonics with the
wavelengths λn = λ0/n and then focus them down to
λn. However, one has to distinguish be-
a spot size
tween coherent and incoherent harmonics.
If the har-
monics are incoherent, then the harmonics intensities are
to be added. Since the dimension of the focal spot scales
as 1/n, the ﬁeld at the incoherent focus is boosted only
if the harmonic spectrum decays slower than 1/n2 .

∼

The case of CHF is very much diﬀerent. One gener-
ates high harmonics coherently and focuses them in such
a way that the ﬁelds of all harmonics interfere construc-
tively within the (very small!) focal volume. We see later
that in order to boost the intensity by means of the CHF
mechanism, the harmonic spectrum must decay slower
than 1/n4. Such spectra do exist. Recently, it has been
shown that the high harmonics spectrum produced in the
laser interaction with a sharp plasma boundary is a uni-
versal one and it decays as 1/ω5/2 [8]. It is also important
that the laser-plasma surface harmonics are coherent and
appear in the form of (sub-)attosecond pulses [7, 8]. Ex-
perimentally, the plasma surface harmonics are produced
by irradiating the surface of a solid material by a rela-
tivistically intense laser pulse [9]. Being exposed to the
laser, the surface becomes a plasma with the solid state
density. Shaping the target surface appropriately, one
can focus the harmonics.

To explain the CHF mechanism let us consider a laser

In this work we present the concept of a Coherent
Harmonic Focusing (CHF) and demonstrate by means

This wave is reﬂected by a sharp surface of the plasma
electron ﬂuid. The ponderomotive force of the laser pulse

ﬁeld Eω ∝

If the harmonics are incoherent, then the function Ψ(ω)
is a fast oscillating one and only one harmonic with the
frequency satisfying dΨ(ω)/dω = t
R0/c signiﬁcantly
contributes to the integral in (8) at the time t. Thus
there is no increase in the intensity at the focus due to
the incoherent harmonic focusing for p > 2.

Now we are going to derive an analytical scaling for the
CHF-intensity in the focal spot as a function of the inci-
dent laser amplitude and the plasma density. To tackle
this problem we have to solve the Vlasov equation on the
electron distribution function f (t, r, p)

where the spherical laser wave was converging down to
the theoretically smallest possible spot size λ0/2.

cal plane of the converging fundamental laser wave (no

It follows immediately from (13) that the relativis-
tic γ-factor of the reﬂecting surface scales as γ(t) =
a0ˆγ (ω0t, ω0τ, Γ), where ˆγ is a universal function. As a
result, one ﬁnds

γmax = G (Γ, ω0τ ) a0,

nc = 4a2

(14)

as well as η = η (Γ, ω0τ ), ϕ = ϕ (Γ, ω0τ ), where all the
functions η, G and ϕ are universal.

Having at our disposal the similarity theory we can ﬁnd
the focal intensity analytically. We choose the parame-
ters ω0τ and Γ so that the spectral slope p = 5/2 and
3/2
q = 3/4. Then, the CHF ampliﬁcation factor is n
. Let
c
us specify our results for this particular case. From Eq.
(6) we obtain a scaling for the focal intensity ICHF pro-
duced by the CHF and for the pulse duration at the fo-
cus τCHF. If one ﬁxes the dimensionless parameter Γ and
changes the laser amplitude a0 together with the plasma
density Ne in such a way that Γ = a0Nc/Ne = const,

pared with the simple linear focusing. Fig. 1c shows the
on-axis cut of the CHF reﬂected intensity in the polar-
ization plane (XY ) at the focusing time. Here one sees a
periodic structure deﬁned by the half-wavelength of the
laser fundamental and the very sharp intensity spike at
the CHF focus. The same spike is perfectly seen also in
Fig. 1b. The spike tip has a width of the single grid
cell hy = hz = 0.0125λ0 in our 3D PIC simulation.
This means that the numerical grid was insuﬃcient to

resolve the CHF reliably. Yet, the 3D PIC simulation
108 grid cells and 109 numerical
contained already 3
particles. This is the very limit of the available com-
putational power. The further grid reﬁning by factor 2
in each dimension of the 3D geometry would require 16
times more computational time and 8 times more mem-
ory, which is not feasible presently.

To ﬁt the problem into the available computational re-
sources, we used 1D PIC simulations and assumed that
the 1D harmonics are reﬂected by a spherically focusing
mirror. Then, we applied the operator (5) to the har-
monics Eω taken from the 1D PIC results. The mirror
radius was R0 = 4 λ0 and the solid angle Ω = 1. On
this way we were able to obtain numerically the scaling
for the CHF focal intensity ICHF over a wide range of
the incident laser intensities I0. The results are shown
in Fig. 2. We have assumed the fundamental laser wave-
length λ0 = 750 nm and ﬁxed the dimensionless param-
eter Γ = aNc/Ne = 0.6. The numerical results in Fig. 2
agree well with the analytical scaling (15). The bro-
ken line in Fig. 2 marks the vacuum breakdown intensity
IQED. The scaling in Fig. 2 shows that the intensity IQED
can be achieved in the CHF focus by using an incident

In conclusion, we propose a new way to achieve ex-
treme intensities in the coherent harmonics focus. The
CHF eﬀect allows to reach the Schwinger limit of vacuum
polarization using source laser pulses with reasonable in-
tensities. Simultaneously, the CHF works as a spectral
ﬁlter and shortens the pulse duration down to the zep-
tosecond range.

We are very obligued to Prof. Gerard Mourou for fruit-

ful discussions on the high harmonics focusing.

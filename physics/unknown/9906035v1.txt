The problem of prediction of a given time series is examined on the basis of recent
nonlinear  dynamics  theories.  Particular  attention  is  devoted  to  forecast  the  amplitude  and
phase of one of the most common solar indicator activity, the international monthly smoothed
sunspot number. It is well known that the solar cycle is  very  difficult  to  predict  due  to  the
intrinsic complexity of the related time behaviour and to the lack of a successful quantitative
theoretical  model  of  the  Sun  magnetic  cycle.  Starting  from  a  previous  recent  work,  we
checked the reliability  and  accuracy  of  a  forecasting  model  based  on  concepts  of  nonlinear
dynamical  systems  applied  to  experimental  time  series,  such  as  embedding  phase  space,
Lyapunov  spectrum,  chaotic  behaviour.  The  model  is  based  on  a  locally  hypothesis  of  the
behaviour  on  the  embedding  space,  utilizing  an  optimal  number  k  of  neighbour  vectors  to
predict  the  future  evolution  of  the  current  point  with  the  set  of  characteristic  parameters
determined by several previous parametric  computations.  The  performances  of  this  method
suggests  its  valuable  insertion  in  the  set  of  the  called  statistical-numerical  prediction
techniques, like Fourier analyses, curve fitting, neural networks, climatological, etc. The main
task  is  to  set  up  and  to  compare  a  promising  numerical  nonlinear  prediction  technique,
essentially based on an inverse problem, with the most accurate predictive methods like the
so-called  "precursor  methods"  which  appear  now  reasonably  accurate  in  predicting  "long-
term" Sun activity, with particular reference to the "solar" precursor methods based on a solar
dynamo theory.

INTRODUCTION

Solar activity forecasting is an important topic for various scientific and technological
areas, like space activities related to operations of low-Earth orbiting satellites, electric power
transmission  lines,  geophysical  applications,  high  frequency  radio  communications.  The
particles  and  electromagnetic  radiations  flowing  from  solar  activity  outbursts  are  also
important to long term climate variations and thus it is very important to know in advance the
phase and amplitude of the next solar and geomagnetic cycles. Nevertheless, the solar cycle is
very difficult to predict on the basis of time series of various proposed indicators, due to high
frequency  content,  noise  contamination,  high  dispersion  level,  high  variability  in  phase  and
amplitude. This topic is also complicated by the lack of a quantitative theoretical model of the
Sun magnetic cycle. Many attempts to predict the future behavior of the solar activity are well
documented in the literature. Numerous techniques for forecasting are developed to predict
accurately phase and amplitude of the future solar cycles, but with limited success. Depending
on the nature of the prediction methods we can distinguish five classes: 1) Curve fitting, 2)
Precursor, 3) Spectral, 4) Neural networks, 5) Climatology.
Apart  from  precursor  methods,  the  main  limitation  is  the  short  time  interval  of  reliable
extrapolations,  as  the  case  of  the  McNish-Lincoln  curve  fitting  method.  [1]  In  the
climatological  method  we  predict  the  behaviour  of  the  future  cycle  by  a  weighted  average
from  the  past  N  cycles,  based  on  the  assumption  of  a  some  degree  of  correlation  of  the
phenomenon.  A  recent  multivariate  stochastic  approach  inside  this  class  of  methods  is
documented in [2].
A  modern  class  of  solar  activity  prediction  methods  appears  to  reasonably  successful  in
predicting "long range" behavior, the precursor methods. Precursor are early signs of the size
of  the  future  solar  activity  that  manifest  before  the  clear  evidence  of  the  next  solar  cycle.
There  are  two  kind  of  precursor  methods:  geomagnetic  (Thompson,  1993)  [3],  and  solar
(Schatten, 1978,1993) [4]. The basic idea is that if these methods work they must be based
upon  solar  physics,  in  particular  a  dynamo  theory.  The  precursor  methods  invoke  a  solar
dynamo mechanism, where the polar field in the descending phase and minimum is the sign of
future  developed  toroidal  fields  within  the  sun  that  will  drive  the  solar  activity  (Schatten,
Pesnell,1993). The dynamo method was successfully tested with different solar cycles with a
proper  statistical  approach  and  verified  by  a  scientific  panel  supported  by  NOAA  Space
Enviroment  Center  and  NASA  Office  of  Space  Science,  (1996,1997)  [5].  The  panel
recommendations for  future  solar  activity  studies  was  based  on  some  criticisms  about  long
term  solar  cycle  prediction  because  the  weak  physical  basis  of  such  predictions  and  the

2

limitations of the data used to define and extend solar and geophysical behaviour: "prediction
research  should  be  supported  and  the  scientific  community  encouraged  to  develop  a
fundamental  understanding  of  the  solar  cycle  that  would  provide  the  basis  for  physical
rather than the present empirical prediction methods".
Although the dynamo method and in general the precursor methods, seems to work well, they
might be affected by some severe drawbacks, like telescope drifts and secular drifts of non-
magnetic solar wind parameters. However, as pointed out by the authors, we need a better
scientific basis.
Thus, at present, the statistical-numerical approach, based on some  reliable  characterization
and prediction of the complex time series behaviour, without any intermediate model, it still
appears  as  a  valuable  technique  to  provide  at  least  the  basis  for  future  physical  prediction
methods.
The international sunspot number is a index characterizing the level of solar activity and it is
regurarly provided by the Sunspot Index Data Center of the Federation of Astronomical and
Geophysical  data  analysis  Services.  [6]  The  predictions  are  confined  to  the  so  called
smoothed  monthly  sunspot  number,  a  particular  filtered  signal  from  the  monthly  sunspot
number. Figure 1 shows the time series  of  the  monthly  sunspot  number  (blue  line)  and  the
related smoothed monthly sunspot number (red line) from SIDC for the last two solar cycles
and for the current 23th cycle. (June 1999)

 In order to obtain accurate predictions it is required  to  analyze  the  data  recorded  for  long
time.  Figure  2  shows  the  whole  time  series  of  the  monthly  mean  sunspot  numbers  for  the
period 1749.5-1998.872.

Figure 2

The intrinsic complexity in the behaviour of the sunspot numbers, suggested the possibility of
a nonlinear  (chaotic)  dynamics  governing  the  related  process,  as  well  pointed  out  by  many
previous  works.  In  particular  here  we  refer  to  the  recent  paper  of  Zhang  [7]  in  which  we
proposed an interesting and promising nonlinear prediction method for the smoothed monthly
sunspot numbers. The aim of the present paper is to support the nonlinear approach given in
[7], adding a more complete and refined analysis with different nonlinear dynamics tools.

NONLINEAR DYNAMICS APPROACH

The nonlinear feature of the monthly mean sunspot number time series was not evident in the
past as well documented by many different works. As example in the paper of Price, Prichard
and  Hogenson  in  1992  [8]  we  founded  no  evidence  of  the  presence  of  low  dimensional
deterministic behaviour in the set of the monthly mean sunspot numbers, suggesting that the
filtering techniques, used to derive smoothed time series, can give some spurious evidence for
the  presence  of  deterministic  nonlinear  behaviour.  Conversely,  more  recent  works  clearly
showed strong evidences for the presence of a deterministic nonlinear dynamics governing the
sunspot  numbers    [9],[10],[11].  Recently  Kugiumtzis  investigates  some  properties  of  the
standard and a refined surrogate technique of Prichard and Theiler to test the nonlinearity in a
real time series, showing that for the annual sunspot numbers there is a strong evidence that a
nonlinear dynamics is in fact present, enforcing also the idea that the sunspot numbers are in
first approximation proportional  to  the  squared  magnetic  field  strength.  [12]  In  the  present
work  we  used  the  method  of  surrogate  data  combined  with  the  computation  of  linear  and
nonlinear  redundancies,  to  show  that  the  monthly  mean  sunspot  number  data  contain  true
nonlinear dependencies [13] [14].
The use  of  the  information-theoretic  functionals,  called  redundancies,  has  at  least  three
important advantages in comparison to other linear and nonlinear correlation analyses:

1)  Various  types  of  the  redundancies  can  be  constructed  in  order  to  test  very  specific
types of dependence between/among variables;

2)  The  redundancies  can  be  naturally  evaluated  as  functions  of  time  lags,  so  that
dependence  structures  under  study  are  not  evaluated  statically,  but  with  respect  to
dynamics of a system under investigation;

3)  For  any  type  of  the  redundancy  its  linear  form  exists,  which  is  sensitive  to  linear
dependence only. These linear redundancies are used for testing quality of surrogate data
in order to avoid spurious detection of nonlinearity.

The  basic  idea  in  the  surrogate  data  correlation  analysis  is  to  compute  a  linear  and
nonlinear statistic  from data under study (original) and an ensemble of realizations of a
linear stochastic process (surrogates) which mimics linear properties only of the original
data.  If  the  computed  statistic  for  the  original  data  is  significantly  different  from  the
values obtained for the surrogate set, one can infer that the data were not generated by a
linear process; otherwise the null hypothesis, that a linear model fully explains the data is

5

accepted  and  the  data  can  be  usefully  analyzed  and  characterized  by  using  well-
developed linear methods.

Here we consider the  nonlinear R(X,Y) redundancy of the type:

where X and Y are random variables with a probability function p(x)=Pr(X=x), H(X) is
the entropy and H(X,Y) is the joint entropy. Here: Y=X(t+t ) and R=R(t ).
If the variables X and Y have zero means, unit variances and correlation matrix C, the
linear redundancy L(X,Y) is of the form:

where s

We  define  the  test  statistic  as  the  difference  between  the  redundancy  obtained  for  the
original data and the mean redundancy of a set of surrogates, in the number of standard
deviations (SD) of the  latter.  Both  the  redundancies  and  redundancy  based  statistic  are
function  of  the  time  lags  t .  The  general  redundancies  R  detect  all  the  dependencies
contained  in  the  data  under  study,  while  the  linear  redundancies  are  sensitive  to  linear
structures only. Fig.3 shows the results of the computation of linear redundancy L, and
nonlinear  redundancy  R  for  both  the  original  time  series  of  the  monthly  mean  sunspot
numbers  and  the  related  surrogate  ensemble  (30  realizations)  as  functions  of  time  lags.
We computed linear and nonlinear redundancies for 30 realizations of the surrogate time
series  which  mimic  the  linear  properties  of  the  original  data.  We  show  the  mean
redundancies  computed  for  the  surrogate  ensembles:  the  linear  redundancy  curve
coincides  with  the  linear  redundancy  of  the  original  time  series;  whereas  the  general
redundancy is well distinct from the general redundancy of the original data. Fig.4 shows
the  quantitative  analysis  of  the  differences  between  the  redundancies.  The  linear
redundancy L for the data and for the surrogates coincide because there is no significant
difference  in  the  linear  statistic  (differences  <1  SD)  i.e.  the  surrogates  mimic  well  the
linear  dependences  of  the  series,  and  should  not  be  a  source  of  spurious  results  in  the
nonlinear  test.  On  the  other  hand  the  result  for  the  general  redundancy  for  the  original
data is clearly different from the mean redundancy for the surrogates, and the nonlinear

statistic  indicates  highly  significant  differences  (>2  SD).  Thus  the  linear  stochastic  null
hypothesis  is  rejected  and,  considering  also  the  results  from  linear  statistic,  significant
nonlinearity  are detected in a reliable way on the time series.

The nonlinearity analysis on the monthly mean sunspot numbers clearly supports the use
of  the  nonlinar  dynamics  approach  as  possible  prediction  method.  Previous  preliminary
works    on  the  subject  show  many  characteristics  of  the  intrinsic  nonlinear  dynamics
governing    sunspot  numbers.  For  example,  Ostryakov  and  Usoskin  in  1990  estimated
their  fractal  dimension  for  different  periods  founding  a  value  around  4.  More  recently
Zhang  in  1995  estimated  more  precisely  the  fractal  dimension,  D=2.8  –
  0.1,  and  the
largest Lyapunov exponent, l =0.023 –
 0.004 bits/month for the monthly  mean  sunspot
numbers  for  the  period  1850-1992  using  the  methods  given  by  Grassberger  and
Procaccia and Wolf. [15], [16]. The result is the existence of  a upper limit of the time
scale for reliable deterministic prediction: 3.6– 0.6 years. The important indication is that
long-term  deterministic  behavior  is  unpredictable.  Many  authors  proposed  nonlinear
prediction  techniques  of  chaotic  time  series  as  an  inverse  problem  for  short-term
prediction,  with  different  levels  of  accuracy.  Recently,  Zhang  proposed  a  prediction
technique  which  improves  medium-term  prediction  for  the  smoothed  monthly  sunspot
numbers using a given local linear map to solve the inverse problem [7].
The common basis of the above works is the construction of the embedding space from
the  observed  data  which  is  the  natural  vector  space  in  the  nonlinear  dynamics  method.
We note that also modern approaches based on neural networks prediction are based on
the embedding space reconstruction in order to set some of the characteristic parameters
of the model [17],[18].
Typical  experimental  situations  concern  only  a  single  scalar  time  series;  while  the  related
physical systems possess many essential degrees of freedom. The powerfulness of nonlineart
dynamics  methods,  rely  on  the  reconstruction  of  the  whole  system's  trajectory  in  an
"embedding  space"  using  the  method  of  delay-time.  The  reliability  of  computations,
performed on the reconstructed trajectory, is guaranteed by a notable theorem by Takens and
Mañé (1981) [19].

Let  a  continuous  scalar  signal  x(t),  here  the  monthly  mean  sunspot  numbers,  be

measured at discrete time intervals, Ts (or dt), to yield a single scalar time series:

tx( {

0

T2+tx( ),T+tx( ),
s

0

0

s

),...,

 )NT+tx( 

0

s

}.

We  assume  that  x(t)  be  one  of  the  n  possible  state  variables  which  completely
describe our dynamical process. For practical applications, n is unknown and x(t) is the only
measured information about the system. We suppose, however, that the real trajectory lies on
a  d-dimensional  attractor  in  its  phase  space,  where:  d£ n.  Packard  et  Al.  and  Takens  have
shown that starting from the time series it is possible to "embed" or reconstruct a "pseudo-
trajectory" in an m-dimensional embedding space through the vectors (embedding vectors):

t

Here  t   is  called  "delay-time"  or  lag,  and  l  is  the  sampling  interval  between  the  first
components of adjacent vectors. A selection of proper values of parameters in the embedding
procedure is a matter of extreme importance for the reliability of results, as well pointed out
in many works [20], [21], [22], [23]. The delay time, t , for example, is introduced because in
an experiment the sampling interval is in general chosen without an accurate prior knowledge
of characteristic time scales involved in the process.

Takens formal criterion tells us how embedding dimension m and attractor dimension

d must be related to choose a proper embedding, i.e. with equivalent topological properties:

1. + 2d  m ‡

this  statement  generally  results 

Fortunately,  for  practical  applications, 

too
conservative and thus it is adequate and correct a reconstruction of attractor in a space with a
lower  dimensionality.  Here  we  used  a  reliable  method  to  estimate  the  minimum  necessary
embedding  dimension  introduced  by  Kennel  and  Abarbanel  in  1994  and  based  on  the  false
neighbors [24]. The idea is to eliminate "illegal projection" finding for each embedding vector,
the nearest neighbor in different embedding dimensions. If the distance between the vectors in
higher dimensions is  very  large,  then  we  have  a  false  nearest  neighbor  caused  by  improper
embedding. When the fraction of false nearest neighbor is lesser than some threshold we are
able  to  find  the  minimum  embedding  dimension.  For  the  details  of  the  method  we  refer  to
[24].
Figure  5  shows  the  results  of  the  false  neighbor  method  for  the  monthly  mean  sunspot
numbers.
As clearly indicated the minimum embedding dimension value is m=5. This result is coherent
with  previous  analyses  (Zhang,1996),  indicating  that  this  time  series  is  related  to  a  low
dimension nonlinear deterministic system described by a finite  number  of  parameters,  or  by
vectors in a 5 dimensional phase space. In [7]  using  the  Grassberger-Procaccia  method  we
founded a saturation for correlation dimension d=2.8 at m=7; on the other hand the prediction
technique is based on the value m=3.

Here  the  proper  choice  of  delay  time  is  based  on  the  mutual  information  of  Fraser  and
Swinney  [22],  which  is  more  adequate  than  autocorrelation  function  when  nonlinear
dependencies are present:

Figure 6 shows the result of the computation of the mutual information for the monthly mean
sunspot  numbers.  As  we  note,  the  first  local  minimum  of  I(X,Y)  is  positioned  at  40dt
corresponding to an interval of 3.32 years. The components of the embedding vectors can be
considered independent at least with this lag.

For a comparison, in [7] the computation of the autocorrelation function for the period 1850 -
1994 gives a lag equal to 35.

Methods  of  nonlinear  dynamics  can  be  strongly  limited  by  typical  features  of  experimental
situations.  Correlation  dimension  techniques,  in  particular,  are  based  on  assumptions  that
cannot  be  rigorously  fulfilled  by  experiments,  especially  due  to  the  presence  of  broadband
noise.  In  real  cases  can  happens  that  the  presence  of  noise  results  as  a  severe  pitfall  for
correlation  dimension  algorithms,  compromising  the  reliability  of  distinction  between
stochastic and deterministic behaviour.
Besides correlation dimension estimates, the spectrum of Lyapunov's exponents provides an
important quantitative measure of the sensitivity to initial conditions, and moreover, from a
theoretical viewpoint, it is the most useful dynamical diagnostic tool for deterministic chaotic
behaviour.  If  the  Lyapunov's  spectrum  contains  at  least  one  positive  exponent,  then  the
related system is defined to be chaotic and, more important, the value of this exponent yields
the  magnitude  of  predictability  time  scale.  Furthermore,  if  we  are  able  to  compute  the  full
Lyapunov-exponent  spectrum,  the  Kolmogorov-Sinai  entropy  can  be  estimated  using  the

11

Kaplan-Yorke conjecture [20]. However, as well known, there are many difficulties implied in
the  reliable  estimation  of  Lyapunov's  spectrum  from  complex  experimental  data  [25].  This
task  represents  a  current  active  research  area  and  many  authors  have  given  important
improvements. Here we used a combined method deriving from works by Sano and Sawada
(1985)  [26];  Zeng,  Eykholt  and  Pielke  (1991)  [27];  Brown,  Bryant  and  Abarbanel  (1991)
[28].

The Lyapunov's exponents that come out of this procedure, based also on the phase

space reconstruction, we will identify as l

i, arranged in decreasing order:

l

1

l

2

l

3

...

Using the concepts of local and global dimensions, generally defined on the basis of
previous correlation dimension computations, we determine an appropriate cut-off value for
the number of exponents which can be related to the Lyapunov's dimension. In fact, following
the connection postulated by Kaplan and Yorke we compute the Lyapunov's dimension by:

+k = D

L

1=i

,

k

l

i

|
l

|

1+k

where k is  the  maximum  number  of  exponents  that  can  be  added  before  the  sum  becomes
negative. The dimension DL is determined by only the first k+1 exponents; thus the dimension
does not depend on exponents beyond the (k+1)th, which are somewhat spurious.
 For the computation of the complete Lyapunov's spectrum, we selected as local dimension 
dL=5, while the optimal value for global dimension was: dG=2dL+1=11, for the monthly mean
sunspot  numbers.  In  Figure  7  we  display  the  results  of  Lyapunov's  spectrum  computations
using the above characteristic parameters of the embedding reconstruction procedure. As we
can easily verify, the "relaxation" of  Lyapunov's  exponents  is  sufficient  to  extrapolate  quite
reliable  estimates  from  the  Lyapunov's  spectra.  We  note  that,  theorically,  one  of  the
exponents  must  be  zero  (in  our  case  l 2).  More  precisely,    for  the  monthly  mean  sunspot
numbers the single positive exponent was: l 1=0.146 suggesting a limit for reliable predictions
(Lyapunov's time).

The  sum  of  all  the  positive  Lyapunov's  exponents  gives  an  estimation  of  the
Kolmogorov's  entropy  and  its  inverse,  multiplied  by  log2,  gives  the  error  doubling
predictability  time,  tp.  Thus,  in  our  case,  the  estimated  error-doubling  predictability  time
gives: tp=4.72 years (56 dt). This time is the practical limit for reliable predictability.

For comparison in [7], based on the first Lyapunov's exponent with the method of Wolf et al.
[16],  the limit for  deterministic prediction is estimated about 3.6 years.

Lyapunov  dimension  estimation,  based  on  Kaplan-Yorke  conjecture,  gives:  DL» 4.36.    The
above results, unlike the correlation dimension analysis showed in [7] (d=2.8), indicate clearly
an higher degree of geometrical complexity in the phase space for the monthly mean  sunspot
numbers.

The above complete characterization of the nonlinear dynamics governing the monthly mean
sunspot numbers, allows to construct a predictive model based on the nonlinear deterministic
behaviour of the embedding vectors. Here we follows essentially the approach indicated in [7]
to  define  a    smooth  map  for  the  related  inverse  problem.  More  precisely  the  nonlinear
deterministic  behaviour  in  the  embedding  space  implies  the  existence  of  a  smooth  map  fT
satisfying the relation:

T

f

(

y

=)

y

t

+
Tt

for  a  given  embedding  vector  y.  The  inverse  problem  consists  in  the  computation  of  this
smooth  map,  given  a  time  series  {x(t)},  t=1,…n.  This  map  is  the  basis  for  the  predictive
model. Following the approach given in [7] we first divided the known time series into two
parts: the first one: {x(t)}, t=1,…,n' is used to set up the smooth map fT , and the other part:
{x(t)},t=n'+1,…,n  is  used  to  check  the  accuracy  of  the  prediction  model.  From  the  above
analysis we set n'=n-tp/dt. In order to calculate the unknown smooth function fT  we assume a
local linear hypothesis for the evolution of the embedding vectors, and this is quite reliable for
T=1.  Given  the  last  embedding  vector,  we  select  the  first  k  neighboring  vectors  near  the
reference vector in the m=5 embedding space, using a distance function. Then we assume that
the evolution of the selected vector is correlated with the evolution of the neighboring vectors
and  the  parameters  of  this  correlation  are  computed  with  the  solution  of  a  proper  least
squares problem in the embedding space. More precisely, the order of the matrix of the least
squares problem is (kxm+1), and the predicted one step ahead vector is given by solving the
least squares problem for each component of the related k neighboring vectors:

numbers in the interval limited by tp is shown in Figure 8.

The original time series used in the analysis is the monthly mean sunspot data derived from
the SIDC archive [6] (2999 values) for the period: 1749.5- May 1999 (Figure 2). The final

even  if  the  monthly  mean  sunspot  series  contains  high  level  of  broadband  noise  which  can
degrades  severely  the  accuracy  of  the  predictions,  smoothing  is  not  an  invariant  process  in
dynamical systems and may affects some intrinsic features of the original data [13].

The red solid line is the known smoothed monthly sunspot series and the green solid line is
the  corresponding  predicted  behaviour  covering  the  period:  1998.79,  2003.26.  The  red
symbols  are  the  observed  values  derived  after  May  1999.  As  we  see  the  maximum  of  the
smoothed monthly sunspot numbers for the 23th cycle is predicted at 2000.28 with the value
125.6. Based on this prediction the value is comparable with the maximum reached in 1937.5

To  compare,  a  posteriori,  the  accuracies  of  predictions  obtained  using  the  most  efficient
methods proposed  in literature, as example, we show in Figure 11 the predictions given by
SIDC (June 1999).

SM  red  dots  is  a  classical  prediction  method  based  on  an  interpolation  of  Waldmeier's
standard curves, and  CM red dashed  is a combined method (due to K. Denkmayr) a non-
parametric regression technique coupling a dynamo-based estimator with Waldmeier's idea of
standard curves [29].
Typical  precursor  methods,  geomagnetic  and  solar,  predict  high  amplitudes  with  maximum

activity (IPS) [32]. Blue solid line is the prediction from the method of A.G. McNish and J.V.

Cycles 8 through 20 (SIDC). It is important to point out the coherence of  this  methods  to
predict the phase of the next maximum. The global evaluation of the accuracy of predictions
for the 23th solar cycle is postponed to the complete recording of the observed data.

CONCLUSIONS

The problem of prediction of smoothed monthly sunspot numbers is examined, with particular
attention  to  the  nonlinear  dynamics  approach.  The  intrinsic  complexity  of  the  related  time
series strongly affects the accuracy of the phase and amplitude predictions.
Starting from a previous recent work, we checked the reliability of a forecasting model based
on  concepts  of  nonlinear  dynamics  theory  applied  to  experimental  time  series,  such  as
embedding phase space, Lyapunov spectrum, chaotic behaviour.  The analysis clearly pointed
out the nonlinear-chaotic nature with limited predictability of the monthly mean sunspot time
series  as  suggested  in  many  previous  preliminary  works.  The  model  is  based  on  a  locally
hypothesis  of  the  behaviour  on  the  embedding  space,  utilizing  an  optimal  number  k  of
neighbour  vectors  to  predict  the  future  evolution  of  the  current  point  with  the  set  of
characteristic  parameters  determined  by  several  previous  parametric  computations.  The
performances of this method suggests its valuable insertion in the set of the called statistical-
numerical  prediction  techniques,  like  Fourier  analyses,  curve  fitting,  neural  networks,
climatological, etc. The main task is to set up and to compare,  using the data for the current
23th solar cycle, this promising numerical nonlinear prediction technique, essentially based on
an inverse problem, with the most accurate predictive methods, like the so-called "precursor
methods", which appear now reasonably accurate in predicting "long-term" Sun activity.

On the basis of the separated form-factors model, parameters of the polydispersed unilamellar 
DMPC  vesicle  population  are  analyzed.  The  neutron  scattering  length  density  across  the 
membrane  is  simulated  on  the  basis  of  fluctuated  model  of  lipid  bilayer.  The  hydration  of 
vesicle  is  described  by  sigmoid  distribution  function  of  the  water  molecules.  The  results  of 
fitting  of  the  experimental  data  obtained  at  the  small  angle  spectrometer  SANS-I,  PSI 
(Switzerland)  are:  average  vesicle  radius  272– 0.4Å,  polydispersity  of  the  radius  27%, 
membrane thickness 50.6– 0.8Å, thickness of hydrocarbon chain region 21.4– 2.8Å, number of 
water  molecules  located  per  lipid  molecule  13– 1,  and  DMPC  surface  area  59– 2Å2.  The 
calculated water distribution function across the bilayer directly explains why lipid membrane 
is easy penetrated by water molecules.  
 

 
INTRODUCTION 
 
Research  into  the  structure  of  phospholipids,  the  main  component  of  biological 
membranes,  is  very  important  from  the  viewpoint  of  structural  biology,  chemistry  and 
pharmacology. During the last three years SANS and SAXS experiments were performed to 
study the structure of unilamellar vesicles. Average radius of the vesicle population, vesicle 
polydispersity,  membrane  thickness,  and  internal  structure  of  membrane    were  defined  on 
the basis of the hollow sphere model (HS) and the Kratky Porod method [1-4]. 

The  methods  developed  on  the  basis  of  the  hollow  sphere  model  have  principal 
limitation:  the  neutron  scattering  length  density  distribution  across  the  bilayer  is  described 
by  a  constant  or  a  strip  function.  The  uniform  and  the  strip-function  scattering  length 
density  can  be  considered  as  zero-  and  first-order  approximation  in  the  evaluation  of  the 
internal  membrane  structure  from  SANS.  The  real  scattering  density  profile  from  neutron 
diffraction experiments demonstrates a more complex and smooth distribution [5]. 

In [6], the separated form-factor model (SFF) was developed. It allows one to apply 
any  integrable  function  to  simulate  the  scattering  length  density  of  neutrons  across  the 
bilayer  for  the  calculation  of  coherent  macroscopic  scattering  cross  section  of  vesicle 
population. The structure factor of the vesicle population was studied via small-angle X-ray 
scattering in the region of lipid concentration 1-5% (w/w) [7]. 

In [8], the fitting codes were developed to analyze the structure of the polydispersed 
population of the unilamellar vesicles on the basis of the SFF model. The parameters of the 
DMPC vesicle population (average radius, polydispersity, membrane thickness, thickness of 

hydrophobic  part,  and  number  of  linear  distributed  water  molecules  in  the  membrane 
bilayer)  were  restored  only  from  the  SANS  spectra,  without  additional  methods  (light 
scattering, diffraction, etc.). The water distribution in the hydrophilic part of membrane was 
simulated  by  linear  functions  of  two  types:  linear  function  with  a  break  point  on  the 
boundary  between  membrane  and  bulk  solvent  and  continuous  linear  function  at  this 
boundary.  It  was  shown  that  continuous  function  better  describes  the  experimental  curve. 
This analysis was based on the experiment carried out at the YuMO small-angle scattering 
spectrometer  in  JINR,  Dubna.  The  SANS  curve  from  the  DMPC  vesicles  at  T=30oC  was 
collected in the range of the scattering vector q from 0.008Å-1 to 0.2Å-1. 

The  same  experiment  was  fitted  in  the  range  of  q  from  0.037Å-1  to  0.14Å-1  in  the 
recent paper [9]. The Kratky-Porod method and the 5-strip model of membrane scattering 
length  density  were  used  in  [9].  Internal  membrane  structure  of  DMPC  bilayer  and  its 
hydration calculated in [8] and [9] are in sufficient agreement between each other. 

An  important  question  is  the  dependence  of  evaluated  parameters  on  the width of q 
range  measured  in  the  experiment.  To  clarify  this  problem,  the  same  model  as in [8], was 
used in our paper [10] for the evaluation of DMPC vesicle parameters measured at T=30oC 
at  the  SANS-1  spectrometer  of  Paul  Scherrer  Institute,  Swizerland.  This  curve  was 
collected  in  the  larger  range  of  the  scattering  vector  q:  from  0.0033Å-1  to  0.56Å-1.  The 
fitting  results  of  [10]  seem  close  to  [8]  although  the  extended  range  of  q  led  to  the 
increasing of a membrane thickness approximately on 5Å and decreasing of the number of 
water molecules in the hydrophilic region from 5.7– 0.2 in [8] to 3.90– 0.03 in [10].  

In  the  present  paper, we apply more realistic and complicated model to evaluate the 
internal DMPC membrane structure. Firstly, the distribution of water molecules through the 
membrane  bilayer  was  described  as  sigmoid  function.  The  linear  distribution  of  water  in 
region  of  polar  head  group  was  proposed  by  J.  Nagle  [11].  The  linear  functions  with 
discontinuity point on the boundary between the membrane and the bulk water were used in 
[12] to fit SANS curve by Kratky-Porod method. Physically, boundary conditions for water 
distribution function should be formulated as necessity to have a continuous first derivative. 
Linear  functions  are  not  satisfied  to  this  request.  We  selected  the  sigmoid  function  as  a 
reasonable function that can satisfy to the boundary conditions. This choice is supported by 
the  water  distribution  function  calculated  via  computer  simulations  [14]  of  DPPC  fluid 
phase.  As  shown  in  [13],  the  simulated  water  distribution  function  is  more  similar  to  the 
sigmoid in comparison with the linear.  

Secondly,  the  neutron  scattering  density  of  polar  head  group  was  modeled  by  the 
Gauss function. The Gauss functions were successfully used by Wiener and White to restore 
the internal membrane structure from neutron and X-ray diffraction experiment [15]. Later, 
this  approach  was  further  developed  for  the  interpretation  of  X-ray  reflectivity  from 
phospholipid  monolayer  on  water  surface  [16].  It  was  shown  that  strip-functions  can  be 
correctly  applied  to  describe  the  reflectivity  curve  only  for  q<0.5Å-1. The Gauss functions 
are  necessary  to  be  introduced  to  describe  experimentally  measured  reflectivity  curve  for 
q>0.5Å-1 [17]. This approach has important physical sense, because the molecular groups in 
phospholipid bilayer (monolayer) are fluctuated near it equilibrium position. Any group can 
be described via two parameters: average group position and the Gauss distribution function 
around  it.  According  to  this  approach,  the  geometrical  sense  of  lipid  membrane  thickness 
changes to the distribution function of polar head group position.

1.  Experiment 

 

Unilamellar  dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine  vesicles  (DMPC)  were  prepared  by 
extrusion  of  15mM  (1%  w/w)  suspension  of  DMPC  in  D2O  through  filters  with  a  pore 
diameter of 500Å.  

The SANS spectra from the unilamellar vesicle population at T=30oC were collected 
at  the  SANS  spectrometer  of  the  Swiss  Spallation  Neutron  Source  at  the  Paul  Scherrer 
Institute  (PSI),  Switzerland.  Three  sample-to-detector  distances  were  used:  2m,  6m,  and 
20m.  Neutron  wavelength  was  4.7– 0.47Å.  The  spectra  were  normalized  on  the 
macroscopic  cross-section  of  H2O.  The  value  of  the  incoherent  background  was  a  fitted 
parameter in the model calculations.  

Note  that  the  accuracy  of  the  vesicle  structure  fitting  strongly  depends  on  the 
experimentally  measured  range  of  the  scattering  vector  [10].  This  means  that  the restored 
parameters of the internal membrane structure depend on the value of maximum q measured 
experimentally.  For  the  system  under study, the experimental conditions allow to collect a 
scattering curve in the q range from qmin=0.0033Å-1 to qmax=0.56Å-1.

scattering vector (q = 4p  sin(q /2)/l , q  - the scattering angle, l  - the neutron wavelength).

Eqs.(5)-(7)  present  the  separated  form-factor  model  (SFF)  for  large  unilamellar 
vesicles [6]. This model has an advantage due to the possibility of describing the membrane 
structure via representation of r (x) as any integrable function.

and D =0.2q was used for Lsd=20m.

where d  are the experimental statistical errors, N is a number of experiment points, k 
exp – experimentally measured coherent macroscopic 

is a number of unknown parameters, S
cross sections.  

The fitting parameters are: average vesicle radius  R , coefficient of polydispersity m, 
(cid:0) (x)  modeling  the  neutron  scattering  length  density.  We 

and  parameters  of  function  r
consider the incoherent background as another unknown parameter of the model.  

Number  of  vesicles  per  unit  volume  n  can  be  obtained  in  the  following  way.  It  is 
known  that  the  volume  of  molecular  DMPC  in  the  liquid  phase  is  VDMPC=V0+nWVD2O 
(where  V0=1101Å3  -  volume  of  ‘dry’  DMPC  molecule  [13],  nW  -  number  of  water 
molecules per one DMPC molecule, VD2O=30 Å3 - volume of the water molecule). Hence, 
the volume of the lipid bilayer can be calculated by formula 

 
V = 4p /3 [( R +d/2)3–( R -d/2) 3 ]. 
 
Here, d is a membrane thickness. So, M=V/VDMPC is the number of DMPC molecules 
in  a  single  vesicle.  The  number  of  DMPC  molecules  in  cm3  can  be  estimated  as 
C=89.17(cid:215) 1017. It means that we can put n=C/M.  

(12) 

 

 

 

 

 

Alternative way to estimate number n is to put M=S/A where S=8p   R 2  is a total area 
of  the  vesicle  surface,    A  is  a surface area of the DMPC molecule. A can be defined from 
formula A=2 VDMPC /d.  

Note  that  n  is  not  constant,  it  depends  on  unknown  fitting  parameters  R   and  d.  In 
both ways we have a problem of unknown parameter nW (number of the water molecules). 
In  [9]  nW  was  fixed;  in  the  present  fitting  we  approximately  put  VDMPC~V0;  number  nW  is 
estimated  after  all  other  vesicle  parameters  have  been  calculated.  This  simplification  can 
only decrease an accuracy in the calculation of average vesicle number in unit volume that is 
beyond our interest; it cannot have influence on the function r (x).  

Finally, in order to estimate the fit quality, we used the following formula:

To  fit  the  SANS  data  in  the  framework  of  SFF  model,  the  Fortran  code  was 

developed using the minimizing code DFUMIL from the JINRLIB library (JINR, Dubna).  

Internal structure of the lipid bilayer was simulated by two types of function r (x). We 
suggested  that  r (x)  is  superposition  of  functions  r ph(x)  (scattering  length  density  of  ‘dry’

Gauss  function  to  model  the  ‘dry’  lipid.  Hydration  of  vesicle  was  simulated  by  sigmoid 
function  (dashed  lines  in  Fig. 1).  The  distribution  shown  ine  Fig. 1a,  is  defined  by  the

Fitting  results  for  the  spectra  of  the  PSI  SANS  experiment  are  presented  in  Fig. 2

large q. In both cases we obtained m=12.5±0.1 (polydispersity 27%); it is in the agreement 
with our previous results [8] and [10].

distribution  from  the  PSI  SANS  spectrum,  d=47.4– 0.04Å.  The  linear  water  distribution 
gives  d=42.7– 0.42Å  from  the  YuMO  spectrum [8]. Kratky-Porod model give d=44.5– 0.3 
in [9], and d=48.08– 0.45Å in [12]. J. Nagle’s estimation is d=44.2Å [13].

Here  we  used  A=2V0/d=  43.5Å2.  This  value  of  A  is  near  the  value  44.8– 1.8Å2  obtained 
from  the  wide-angle  X-ray  diffraction  from  DMPC  multilamellar  vesicles  with  50% 
hydration [22] and can be used as a first-order approximation. Both models give almost the 
same values nW: 12.5– 1.1 in the case (a) and 12.6– 1.1 in the case (b). However, the number 
of water molecules in the region of hydrocarbon chains (integration in equation (20) from 0 
to D/2) is sufficiently different and corresponds to the value 0.11 in the case (a), and to 2.2 
in  (b).  This  means  that  the  model  (a)  shows a small penetration of water molecules inside 
the region of hydrocarbon chains. A standard deviation of the water distribution function in 
the  case  (a)  is  2.4  times  smaller than in the case (b). Consequently, the probability to find 
water  molecules  in  the  region  of  hydrocarbon  chains  is  sufficiently  larger  for  the  case  of 
fluctuated model (b).  

It  is  well  known  from  the  neutron  diffraction  that  water  molecules  easy  penetrate 
through  bilayer  [23].  Our  SANS  results  on  the  basis  of  the  fluctuated  model  (b)  clearly 
support  this  experimental  fact  via  calculation  of  water  distribution  function  across  the 
bilayer.  Taking  into  account  the  X-ray  time-resolved  diffraction  results about 3 min water 
diffusion  through  membrane  under  ice  induced  dehydration  [24],  one  can  expect  that 
fluctuated model of lipid bilayer gives more realistic results. 

In our calculations, we used estimation A=43.5Å2, but in reality this value corresponds 
to the area of membrane surface occupied by a dry DMPC molecule. Now one can make a 
correction of the DMPC surface area, taking into account that water molecules increase the 
volume  occupied  by  one  DMPC  molecule.  The  corrected  value:  VDMPC  =V0+ 
nW(cid:215) 30Å3=1480Å3.  Hence,  taking  into  account  the  DMPC  “swelling”  by  water,  we  obtain 
Aw=2(cid:215) VDMPC/d=58.5– 2Å2.  This  value  A  is  close  to  the  value  59.6Å2 published by J. Nagle 
[13], value 58.9– 0.8Å2 in [9], and value 58.8– 0.5Å2 in [12].  

The  larger  value  of  the  membrane  thickness  in  the  present  study  gives  approximately 
two times larger value of water molecules nw=12.6 per one DMPC molecule (relative to the 
previously published results nw=7.2 [13] and 5.7 [8]). One can check the correctness of the 
evaluation of water distribution function via calculation of the value of nw from eq.(20) with 
value  of  A=59.6Å2  and  d=44.2Å  according  to  [13].  This  gives  6.4  as  a  number  of  water 
molecules  per  one  DMPC  molecule.  The  obtained  result  is  intermediate  between  the 
previously  published  values.  Thus,  water  distribution  function  looks  quite  correct  in  the 
region of polar head groups.  

Full  width  at  half  height  of  the  distribution  function  of  polar  head  groups 
2.36(cid:215)
S =8.0– 1.7Å  can  be  used  to  estimate  the  region  of  polar  head  group  location.  The 
obtained value of polar head group location is near the 9Å thickness of polar head groups 
obtained from the X-ray diffraction [13].

The thickness of hydrocarbon chains D=21.4– 2.6Å obtained in the present paper is not 
at contradiction with Nagle’s result, 26.2 Å obtained via the strip-function approximation of 
electron  density  profile 
the 
hydrophobic/hydrophilic  boundary,  as  was  shown  in  [5],  but  strong  definition  of  this 
boundary as exact value is far beyond the reality. The hydrophobic/hydrophilic boundary is 
some broad region near the value xW-s W=11.4– 0.8Å that reasonably corresponds to the end 
of  hydrocarbon  chains  D/2=10.7– 1.3Å.  It  is  important  to  note  that  three  parameters:  xW, 
s W,  and  D  were  independent  in  our  calculations.  The  description  of  water  distribution 
function  in  the  region  of  hydrophobic/hydrophilic  boundary  and  the  thickness  of 
hydrocarbon chains are not in variance with each other.  

approach  describes  quite  precisely 

An important result of our study is the explanation of the earlier published differences in 
the  evaluation  of  membrane  thickness  for  the  case  r (x)=const  and  r (x)  as  step-function. 
The calculation of the DMPC membrane thickness on the basis of r (x)=const model gives 
value  of  membrane  thickness  36.7– 0.1Å,  which  increases up to the value of 42.1– 0.4Å at 
the  application  of  strip-function  model  of  r (x)  [8].  The  total  neutron  scattering  length 
density  across  the  bilayer  obtained  in  our  study  (see  Fig. 1b)  clearly  demonstrate;  that 
modeling  of  r (x)  via  box  model  with  r (x)=const  inside  the  bilayer  leads  to  decreasing  of 
membrane  thickness  to  the  value  about  34Å.  This  underestimation  of  the  membrane 
thickness on the value of 5.4Å is the result of deep D2O penetration inside the bilayer.  

 
 

 

4.  Conclusions 
 

On  the  basis  of  the  SFF  model,  the  scheme  and  code  of  fitting  the  SANS  spectra  of 
polydispersed vesicle population have been developed taking into account: structure factor,  
spectrometer resolution function, and internal structure of vesicles. The fluctuated model is 
proposed  to  describe  the  internal  structure  of  phospholipid  bilayer.  This  model  describes 
reasonably well the region of hydrocarbon chains, thickness of polar head groups and water 
distribution  function  across  the  bilayer.  The  penetration  of  water  molecules  through  the 
bilayer is proved via direct calculation of water distribution function across the bilayer.

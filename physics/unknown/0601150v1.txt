Abstract 

The comments of Guseinov on our recent paper  ( Czech. J. Phys., 52 

(2002)1297) have been analyzed critically. It is shown that his 

comments are irrelevant and also unjust. In contrast to his comment, it 

is proved that the presented formulae in our study are original and 

obtained independently, not by changing by the summation indices. It 

should be stressed that our algorithm is not affected from possible 

instability problems and also can be used in large scale calculations 

without loss of significant figures. Meanwhile, his comment on the 

transformation of our formula into his formula proves the correctness 

of our algorithm and therefore can be regarded as a nice sound of 

science.

Key words: surface and regular solid spherical harmonics, multicenter integrals, 

associated Legendre functions.  

 The comments on our recent paper [1] by I.I. Guseinov have been analyzed 

critically. In his comment, he claims that the formulae we presented in Ref. [1] were not 

original and could be derived from his previous works by changing the summation indices. 

His claims will be replied items by items in the following: 

 
Comment 1: He claims that the formulae given by Eqs. (14-16, 21-23, 27-28) in 

our paper [1] are not original.

 As is well known, spherical harmonics (SH) are the simplest and most familiar 

functions of mathematical physics, and also important for the calculation of molecular 

properties of atoms, molecules and solids, in Earth sciences, and in potential theory. The 

detailed discussion of the SH can be found in an excellent article by E.O. Steinborn and K. 

Rudenberg [2] (cited as Ref. [1] in our paper [1]). 

 As we understood from this comment, he either could not understand what the 

purpose of our paper is or behaved prejudicially as he always does.  

 It is seen clearly from the second paragraph of our paper [1] that the aim of our 

study was to give the cartesian expression for surface and regular solid spherical harmonics 

and to discuss the main advantage of our algorithm in the evaluation of the multicenter 

integrals. It is well known from the literature that the symmetry properties for spherical 

harmonics have not been introduced firstly by him as he claimed! and also was not the aim of 

our study. The symmetry properties presented for solid spherical harmonics was to test the 

expression presented in our paper [1]. 

 

Comment 2: He claims that the presented formulae for the generalized binomial 

coefficients

 (Eq. (27) of Ref.[1]) and the expansion of the product of two 

normalized associated Legendre functions 

 in ellipsoidal coordinates (Eq. (24 of

Ref.[1]) are not original.

As is well known in literature, the expansion coefficients of the product

, and the expansion 

)NNFm
(
,

of the product of two normalized associated Legendre functions in ellipsoidal coordinates can 

be found elsewhere (see: Eq. (A.12) of Ref. [3]; cited as. Ref. [15] in our paper [1]). The 

reference [3] is the fundamental book of quantum chemistry published many years ago 

before the work of Guseinov [4]. These expressions were applied in the calculation of 

multicenter molecular integrals over Slater type orbitals. So, these expressions are not 

introduced firstly by him as he claims !!!.  

 Contrary to his comments, we think that any physical or mathematical quantities 

obtained in two different ways can be transformed into each other. In this respect, the 

comments of Guseinov on the transformability of our formulae into his formulae prove the

correctness of our algorithm and can be regarded as a sound and nice contribution to the 

science. Meanwhile, he published comments on some of our previous papers. Despite each of 

his comments has been replied, he ignores our replies and this causes misunderstanding for 

the readers and publishers. Replies to Guseinov’s comments can be found from Refs. [5-9] or

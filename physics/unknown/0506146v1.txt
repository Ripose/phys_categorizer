ABSTRACT 

Cooperation in merging is introduced by adding interactions between pairs of vehicles in 

opposite lanes.  Simulations with an improved version of the modified optimal velocity 

model are done for two lanes merging into a single lane. For  ~30 seconds prior to 

reaching the merge region, vehicles in both lanes adjust their headways to create safe 

distances in front of and behind the merging vehicle.  Cooperation prevents the transition 

from free flow to synchronous flow that occurs for normal merging, provided the merge 

region is sufficiently large and the total incoming flow does not exceed the maximum 

possible single-lane flow.  No long-range vehicle-to-vehicle communication is required 

for the type of cooperation considered.

INTRODUCTION 

Synchronous flow (SF), like a traffic jam, is an emergent phenomenon [1]. Drivers 

unintentionally self organize to transform free flow (FF) into a new phase [2].  In most 

instances, the transition is initially FF to SF and then later it can be followed by SF to a 

jam, although FF to a jam is possible, according to the three-phase model of Kerner and 

coworkers [3]. These transitions are considered first order. For reviews of traffic 

modeling and empirical data see reference [4]. 

Synchronous flow, a phase of traffic that can extend over macroscopic distances             

(> 1 km), generally results from vehicles(cid:146) merging (from an on-ramp) with the incoming 

flow on the main road.  Local rules for merging, such as requiring speed-dependent safe 

distances to the preceding and following vehicles in the opposite lane, are sufficient to 

produce SF in simulations using realistic vehicle dynamics when the flow is high enough 

The probability to form jams can be reduced by anticipation, that is, making use of 

information about more than just the closest vehicle in front [6].  Looking ahead 

(observing tail lights for several preceding vehicles in the same lane, for example) helps 

drivers anticipate the response they should make.  It has been found that anticipation 

stabilizes flow against the formation of jams [6].  It is interesting to ask if there exist 

analogous changes in the local merging rules that suppress the FF to SF transition. The 

purpose of this paper is to present one such change involving cooperation of pairs of 

drivers (vehicles) [7] and to evaluate its effects.  This cooperation between pairs is 

required over times of approximately 30 seconds (hereafter denoted by s), but does not 

require long-range vehicle-vehicle communication.  The study of cooperative merging is 

important because it improves our understanding of SF formation; and it could have 

implications for improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. 

A schematic diagram of the vehicle interactions is shown in Fig. 1.  Within a distance 

0z  

of the end of the merge region, a vehicle on the on-ramp (denoted by B) not only interacts

[5]. 

 

 

 

 

 

with the vehicle immediately preceding it in the same lane (denoted by 2), but also with a 

vehicle, if it is closer, in the opposite lane (denoted by A).  Likewise, a vehicle on the 

main road (denoted by 1) interacts with the preceding vehicle in the same lane (A) and 

the vehicle on the on-ramp (B), if it is closer.  The purpose of the additional interactions 

is to ensure that a safe distance exists in front of and behind the merging vehicle when it 

reaches the merge region (-dmerge  < x < 0). 

The paper is organized as follows.  The model is presented in Section II.  Results from 

simulations using the model are given in Section III.  The summary is given in Section

II. TRAFFIC MODEL FOR SIMULATIONS 

The dynamical model for vehicular motion is described in this section.  The model 

improves upon the modified optimal velocity model [5] primarily by including 

mechanical constraints on acceleration and deceleration [8].  The model also incorporates 

a velocity-dependent synchronization distance and is fully consistent with the three-phase 

model [3].  In addition, the rules for merging [5] have been altered slightly to be more 

self-consistent.  Randomly distributed vehicle time constants and a power-law headway 

distribution for the initial conditions are used.  These improvements make the traffic 

model more realistic. 

The Model 

 
The position and velocity of the nth vehicle as a function of time t are denoted by xn(t) and 

vn(t).  Ascending values of the index n correspond to increasingly negative initial 

positions xn(0) in each lane (main line and on-ramp).  The delay time due to driver 

reaction is td.   Let the effective headway (including vehicle length) be

 in Eq. (9) replaces the fixed distance L of reference 5.  L was 

introduced originally [5] to cause vehicles to close a large gap to the preceding vehicle 

and it is more realistic to make it velocity dependent than fixed. The constants in Eq. (7) 
are given by C1 = 0.086/m, C2 = 0.913, h0 = 25 m, and V0 = 16.8 m/s [11].   

Note that there are solutions to this model of the form vn(t) = v0 and ∆xn(t) = ∆xn(0) 

where the initial differences in position satisfy HOV(v0) < ∆xn(0) < 2 HOV(v0) but are 

otherwise arbitrary.  Thus the model satisfies the basic postulate of the three-phase model 

[3], namely that equilibrium solutions can occupy a two-dimensional region of flow-

density space.

must be satisfied.  Here H   serves as a velocity-dependent safe distance for merging. 

The factor Sf is taken to be 0.7.  By trial and error, this value was found to give 

satisfactory merging that did not interrupt mainline flow substantially, yet permitted 

reasonable merge rates and merge velocities.  Vehicles are selected at random to possibly 

merge every 0.05 s. 

The lead vehicle in lane 2 approaches the downstream end of the merge region as if a 

phantom vehicle existed at x = 0 with v = vLimit.  In addition, if

Power-law Distribution of Initial Headways 

To mimic approximately, but simply, empirical headways [13] a power-law distribution 

is employed for specifying the initial conditions.  The headways are defined here as the 

distance from the center of one vehicle to the center of the next.  A sequence of headways 

is generated by repeatedly setting 

where r is a random number 0 < r < 1 and h0 is the smallest headway.  It is determined by 

the initial velocity v0 according to h0 =  HOV(v0).  The average headway is

The probability that a headway is in the range h to h + δh is P(h) δh for h > h0 where 

The probability vanishes for h < h0.  

Cooperative Merging Formalism 

In this section, I formulate the way a vehicle gradually adjusts its position to the 

preceding vehicle in opposite lane as they approach the merge region.  The objective of 

8

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cooperative merging is to have safe headways in front and back so that the merging 

vehicle can change lanes without slowing down appreciably.  Let z0 be a point upstream 

of the merge region. Consider a vehicle (denoted by 1 in Fig. 1) in lane 1 with label n. 

Then for z0< xn(t-td) <-dmerge let

This part of cooperative merging ensures there is a suitable gap on the main line behind 
the merging vehicle. If xB (t-td)> xn-1(t-td) [n-1 is the preceding vehicle in lane 1, denoted 

by A in Fig.1] then I set α = 0, because the main line vehicle should not come too close to 

the preceding vehicle in the same lane. 

The other part of cooperation involves the on-ramp vehicles.  For a vehicle in lane 2 
(denoted by B in Fig. 1) with label n, let xA (t- td) be the position of the nearest preceding 
vehicle in lane 1 (denoted by A in Fig. 1).  Define VA(t) analogously to Eq. (24) with xB

RESULTS 

In this section I present results from simulations using the model described in Sec. II.  For 

a power-law distribution with n = 3 and h0 = 50 m, a typical distribution is shown in Fig. 

2.  Note that n = 3 corresponds to 

hP
)(

. The distribution is similar to that 

∝

h

observed [11].  For the calculations presented here the possible initial positions of 
vehicles are determined by letting xk = xk-1  - hk where the kth headway hk is given by the 
kth random number in Eq. (19). [For lane 1, x0 = 0, the initial position of the lead vehicle.]  

However, not all possible initial positions are necessarily occupied.  I randomly occupy 

sites in lane 1 (2) with probability p1 (p2).  Fig. 2 pertains to the probability being unity.   

Vehicles in lane 2 are initially offset upstream by 1000 m.  I take the mechanical time 

constant τn (in seconds) to be randomly chosen from the interval [0.5,1.0].  The delay 

time is td = 0.75 s [5, 10].  A speed limit of 32 m/s is imposed and the length of the merge 

region is 300 m, unless noted otherwise. 

The velocity at which vehicles merge is not only determined by p1 and p2 but also by the 

length dmerge.  The latter effect is due to deceleration as the lead vehicle in lane 2 

approaches the end of the merge region at x = 0. From Eq. (17) we can see that maximum 

merge velocity is approximately

g da

merge

.  Dynamical effects prevent this from being 

an exact maximum. 

Simulations 

I take p1 = 0.7, p2 = 0.45, n = 3, h0 = 50 m, dmerge = 300 m, and z0 = -1000 m.  In Fig. 3, 

the position and velocity of merges for cooperative and normal merging are compared.  

We see that for cooperative merging the merge velocities are between 25 and 30 m/s, 

whereas normal merging produces a range of values down to 9 m/s.  These merges are 

distributed along the curve

x

/2−=
v

ga

where ag = 3 m/s2 because of deceleration near the 

downstream end of lane 2 [Eqs. (17) and (18)].   With cooperative merging, vehicles in 

lane 2 can change lanes almost immediately (recall there is a 0.75-s delay for driver 

11

 

 

 

 

 

reaction) after entering the merge region because the interacting vehicles adjust headways 

in the region z0 > x > 0.  The effect on the formation of SF of higher merge velocities due 

to cooperative merging is shown in Fig. 4.  With normal merging, a well-defined region 

of SF forms in lane 1 and extends almost to x = (cid:150)1.5 km by t = 500 s.  In contrast, 

vehicles in lane 1 operating with cooperative merging maintain FF throughout this region 

with only a slight decrease in velocity.   

Increasing p2 up to 0.7 (Fig. 5) does not induce SF if merging is cooperative. The total 

number of vehicles exiting and the number of merges in 500 s increase linearly and the 

difference between the two remains nearly constant as a function p2.  Because merging 

takes place at reasonably large velocities, vehicles entering from lane 2 do not 

appreciably decrease the incoming flow from lane 1.  Fig. 6 shows the striking difference 

between the behaviors of the difference (total less merges) as a function of p2.  Normal 

merging produces a marked decrease above p2 = 0.4 where there is a transition to the SF 

phase in lane 1, while little change occurs for cooperative merging.  When SF forms with 

normal merging, the incoming flow is diminished considerably relative to the upstream 

There are, however, limitations to the extent which cooperation suppresses SF formation.  

If dmerge is only 100 m, deceleration due to the approaching end of the merge region limits 

the merge velocity to about 15 m/s for cooperative merging.  In Fig. 7a, the velocity and 

position of merges are shown for cooperative and normal merging.  Here I consider 

somewhat different parameters, p1 = 1.0, p2 = 0.2, n = 3, h0 = 40 m, and a speed limit of 

30 m/s.  Cooperative merging does not suppress the transition to SF in lane 1 in this case, 

although it does lessen the effect. (See Fig. 7b.) The average velocity in the congested 

region is ~ 5 m/s higher with cooperative merging relative to normal merging.  However, 

if dmerge is increased to 300 m, the transition to SF is avoided (Fig. 8).  For normal 

merging, SF still occurs as it did for shorter dmerge. Since the short merge region reduces 

the maximum velocity at which merges can occur, even if cooperation exists, some 

reduction of the flow in lane 1 results. 

flow. 

 

 

 

 

12

Another example where cooperation does not prevent a transition to a congested phase, 

but mitigates the effects is shown in Fig. 9.  The incoming flow has p1 = p2 = 1 for h0 = 

50 m, which gives a rate of 32/75 = 0.427/s in each lane.  The sum, 0.853/s, exceeds the 

theoretical capacity of the outgoing lane, which is 0.772/s (determined by the maximum 

value of VOV(h)/h [See Eq. (7).]).  The flow rate beyond the merge region for normal 

merging is about 0.36/s, which is even less than the incoming flow in either lane.  For 

cooperative merging, the rate fluctuates around 0.7/s, except for a dip near 400 s caused 

by a brief period when merging temporarily occurs at small velocities.  In this case and 

the previous one, the formation of SF cannot be avoided because of a constraint 

(maximum flow limitation or maximum merge velocity due to merge length).  If there are 

no such constraints, cooperation prevents the self-organized congestion. 

Physically, cooperative merging suppresses the transition to the synchronous flow phase 

by ensuring that a merging vehicle has sufficient headway in front and back so that it can 

change lanes without slowing down or forcing other vehicles to decelerate.  In normal 

merging, a mainline vehicle does not adjust its velocity until a merge occurs in front of it.  

Up until then it has followed the vehicle immediately ahead in the same lane.  When a 

vehicle merges normally, it often does so at low velocity because it has neared the 

downstream end of the merge region.  This causes some incoming mainline vehicles to 

decelerate abruptly and congestion can ensue in heavy traffic if there are frequent low-

velocity merges.  In other situations, the merging vehicle may have to decelerate if the 

mainline vehicle in front is moving slowly.  In either case, cooperation results in a 

gradual opening of a safe gap for the merging vehicle to fit into prior to reaching the 

merge region.  It does so without inducing congestion.  Limits on acceleration and 

deceleration, not imposed in reference [5], exacerbate the effects of merging and make 

the effects of cooperation more pronounced.

IV. 

SUMMARY 

Refinements to the modified optimal velocity model, which take account of the 

mechanical restrictions on vehicle acceleration and deceleration, have been implemented.    

Changes to the rules for merging at an on-ramp have been made to introduce cooperation.   

Here a vehicle on the on-ramp not only interacts with the vehicle in front of it in the same 

lane (or the end of the merge region if it is the lead vehicle) but also with a vehicle in the 

opposite lane (main road) when closer.  Likewise, a vehicle on the main road interacts 

with the vehicle in front of it and with a potential merging vehicle if it is closer.  The 

purpose of the additional interactions, which are of a car-following nature, is to adjust 

headways so that safe distances in front of and behind the merging vehicle are obtained 

before reaching the region where merging is allowed. 

Compared to normal merging, where there is no cooperation, the effects of cooperative 

merging are striking.  Simulations described in Sec. III demonstrate that the transition to 

the SF phase can be completely suppressed if the merge region is large enough.  Of 

course, the total incoming flow must not exceed the maximum theoretical capacity of the 

single lane downstream of the on-ramp.  If the merge region is short, then vehicles must 

necessarily merge at low velocities because of the approaching end of the merge region.  

In this instance, cooperative merging cannot eliminate the transition to SF but it does 

significantly decrease the time required to traverse the congested region.  

 

The results of this work provide another example where changes in local rules affect the 
emergent behavior of traffic.  Anticipation stabilizes traffic against formation of jams [6] 

and cooperation suppresses formation of synchronous flow, the two principal phases of 

congested traffic [2,3].  Anticipation and the additional interaction for lane-2 vehicles in 

cooperative merging (Fig. 1) can be thought of as actions that directly benefit the driver 

performing them, whereas the additional interaction for lane-1 vehicles is more altruistic.

FIGURE CAPTIONS 

 
Fig. 1  (Color online) Schematic of vehicle interactions for cooperative merging.  In the 

region z0 < x < 0, drivers in both lanes adjust their speed and headway according to an 

algorithm that accounts for the preceding vehicle in the same lane as well as any closer 

vehicle in the opposite lane. Vehicle 1 interacts with B in lane 2 and A in lane 1.  Vehicle 

B on the on-ramp interacts with A and 2. 

Fig. 2.  A typical distribution of headways for n = 3 and h0 = 50 m. 

Fig. 3.  (Color online) Position and velocity of merges for cooperative (squares) and 

normal merging (diamonds).  The solid line is

where ag = 3 m/s2.  The 

parameters are p1 = 0.7, p2 = 0.45, n = 3, h0 = 50 m with a lane-2 offset of 1000 m, dmerge 

= 300 m, and z0 = -1000 m. The limiting velocity is 32 m/s.  The delay time is td = 0.75 s 

and 0.5 s < τn < 1.0 s.   

Fig. 4.  (Color online) Velocity vs. position of vehicles in lane 1 at t = 500 s for 

cooperative (squares) and normal merging (diamonds).  The parameters are same as in 

Fig. 3.   

Fig. 5.  (Color online) The total number of vehicles exiting in 500 s (diamonds), the 

number of merges (squares), and the difference (triangles) for cooperative merging as a 

function of p2.  The parameters, other than p2, are the same as in Fig. 3. 

Fig. 6.  (Color online) The difference between the total exiting and the number of merges 

as a function of p2 for normal merging (diamonds) and cooperative merging (squares). 

The parameters, other than p2, are the same as in Fig. 3. 

Fig. 7.  (a) Position and velocity of merges for cooperative (diamonds) and normal 

merging (squares).  (b) Velocity vs. position of vehicles in lane 1 at t = 500 s for 

cooperative (diamonds) and normal merging (squares).  The parameters are p1 = 1.0, p2 =

0.2, n = 3, h0 = 40 m with a lane-2 offset of 1000 m, dmerge = 100 m, and z0 = -1000 m. 

The limiting velocity is 30 m/s.  The delay time is td = 0.75 s and 0.5s  < τn < 1.0 s.   

Fig. 8.  Velocity vs. position of vehicles in lane 1 at t = 500 s for cooperative merging for 

dmerge = 100 m (diamonds) and dmerge = 300 m (squares). The other parameters are the 

same as in Fig. 7. 

Fig. 9.  (a) Velocity vs. position at t =500 s for both lanes. (b) Flow out of merge region 

measured at x = 100 m as a function of time. Cooperative merging is denoted by squares 

and normal merging by diamonds.  The parameters are p1 = p2 =1, h0 = 50 m, n = 3, dmerge 

= 300 m, and z0 = -1000 m.

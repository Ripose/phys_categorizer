ABSTRACT 
Pairing together material slabs with opposite signs for the real parts of their constitutive 
parameters has been shown to lead to interesting and unconventional properties that are 
not  otherwise  observable  for  single  slabs.  One  such  case  was demonstrated analytically 
for  the  “conjugate”  (i.e.,  complementary)  pairing  of  infinite  planar  slabs  of  ε-negative 
(ENG)  and  µ-negative  (MNG)  media  [A.  Alù,  and  N.  Engheta,  IEEE  Trans.  Antennas 
Prop.,  51,  2558  (2003)].  There  it  was  shown  that  when  these  two  slabs  are  juxtaposed 
and excited by an incident plane wave, resonance, complete tunneling, total transparency 
and  reconstruction  of  evanescent  waves  may  occur  in  the  steady-state  regime  under  a 
monochromatic  excitation,  even  though  each  of  the  two  slabs  by  itself  is  essentially 
opaque to the incoming radiation. This may lead to virtual imagers with sub-wavelength 
resolution and other anomalous phenomena overcoming the physical limit of diffraction. 
t =  interacts with such 
Here we explore how a transient sinusoidal signal that starts at 
an  ENG-MNG  pair  of  finite  size  using  an  FDTD  technique.  Multiple  reflections  and 
transmissions at each interface are shown to build up to the eventual steady state response 
of  the  pair,  and  during  this  process  one  can  observe  how  the  “growing  exponential” 
phenomenon may actually occur inside this bilayer.

INTRODUCTION 
The  current  interest  in  understanding  the  physics  behind  the  anomalous  properties  of 
metamaterials  is  evident  in  the  recent  physics  and  engineering  literature.  In  particular, 
artificial materials with negative constitutive parameters, which can be distinguished into 
ε-negative  (ENG),  µ-negative  (MNG)  [1]  and  double-negative  (DNG)  [2]  media  if, 
respectively,  their  effective  permittivity,  permeability,  or  both  of  them  have  a  negative 
real  part,  have  been  at  the  center  of  this  attention,  due  to  the  anomalous  phenomena 
theoretically  predicted  for  their  behavior  and,  in  part,  also  verified  experimentally.  The 
existence and the possible artificial realization of these materials have been studied and 
verified in the past and recent times. In particular, ENG (plasmonic) media exist naturally

in  the infrared and optical frequencies, e.g., noble metals below their plasma frequency 
[3]  and  polar  dielectrics,  and  they  can  be  relatively  easily  synthesized  at  lower 
frequencies  by  embedding  a  regular  lattice  of thin metallic wires in a host medium [4].  
These  inclusions  provide  the  proper  resonant  electric  polarizability  in  such  an  artificial 
material  in  the  desired  frequency  regime.  In  analogy,  an  MNG  material,  such  as  a 
resonant  ferro-magnetic  medium,  may  be  synthesized  by  embedding  resonant  magnetic 
loops in a host medium, i.e., split-ring resonators, thereby providing the proper magnetic 
resonant polarizability in the desired frequency regime [5]. These two techniques may be 
employed at the same frequency to obtain DNG materials within a given frequency range, 
as has been reported in [6]-[7]. To be consistent with the previous terminology, we will 
refer  in  the  following  to  common  materials,  which  have  both  positive  permittivity  and 
permeability, as double-positive (DPS) materials. 
 
One of the most striking properties of a planar DNG slab is represented by the possibility 
that  it  can  focus  sub-wavelength  details,  as  first  predicted  in  [8],  by  fostering  the 
“growth” (instead of the decay) of evanescent waves inside it. Following this discovery, a 
multitude of papers explaining the potential implications and possible limitations of this 
anomalous phenomenon when realistic metamaterials are considered have appeared (see 
e.g.,  [9]-[14]).  In  relation  to  this  phenomenon  it  was  demonstrated  analytically  that  the 
“conjugate”  (i.e.,  complementary)  pairing  of  infinitely  extent  in  two  dimensions, 
juxtaposed planar slabs of ENG and MNG media [1] (as well as DPS and DNG pairs, of 
which  the  perfect  lens  [8]  is  a  special  case),  may  induce  an  anomalous  resonance, 
complete  tunneling,  total  transparency  and  reconstruction  of  evanescent  waves,  even 
though each of the two slabs by itself is essentially opaque to the incoming radiation.  
 
Most of these studies, however, have been performed analytically or numerically for the 
time-harmonic steady-state regime, i.e., under monochromatic excitation at a given fixed 
frequency, at which the involved metamaterials were supposed to have an ENG, MNG or 
DNG response. However, the dispersive nature of these materials, which is well known to 
be  necessary  for  energy  conservation  issues  in  passive  materials  with  negative 
constitutive parameters [15], requires a certain time to establish this desired steady-state 
response  as  demonstrated  previously  [16].  Moreover,  due  to  the  resonant  nature  of  the 
phenomena  associated  with  these  juxtaposed  slabs  and  its  connection  to  surface-
plasmons,  it is clear that a certain amount of time is required to establish this behavior 
and it would be inversely related to the Q factor of this resonance. It is therefore expected 
that  the  response  of  these  slab  structures  to  a  realistic  initial  excitation  is  not 
instantaneous, but would rely on some number of multiple reflections at each interface to 
establish the resonant mode.  
 
In the following, we explore how a transient sinusoidal signal interacts with a juxtaposed  
ENG-MNG  pair,  showing  how  the  multiple  reflections  and  transmissions  at  each 
interface can be designed to build up to the eventual resonant steady-state response of the 
pair.  We will demonstrate that one can observe the “growing exponential” phenomenon 
in this process as it occurs inside this bilayer. Here we have simulated this time-domain 
problem using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique, assuming the Drude 
models for the frequency dependence of the permittivity and permeability of these slabs. 
This choice allowed us to incorporate dispersive effects into the simulation model along 
with  the  possibility  of  having  the  material  properties  of  both  of  these  regions  attain 
specified  negative  real  parts  at  or  approximately  near  the  frequency  of  the  sinusoidal 
excitation.  Our  time-domain  results  confirm  the  steady-state  prediction  of  “growing

exponential”  behavior  in  the  bilayer  and  the  total  resonant  transmission  through  it. 
However as anticipated, these responses are achieved only after a certain period of time 
(i.e.,  a  certain  necessary  number  of  FDTD  time  steps),  which  allows  for  the  buildup  of 
the  interactions  between  the  interfaces.  Consequently,  this  time  delay  is  found  to  be  in 
general  a  function  of  the  thickness  of  the  slabs  and  the  possible  losses  in  each  slab.  A 
sketch of a small portion of these results was presented in a recent symposium [17].

FORMULATION OF THE PROBLEM 
Two  classes  of  numerical  simulations  were  considered  here:  one-dimensional  (1D)  and 
two-dimensional (2D).  The 1D problem represents a plane-wave normally incident on a 
pair  of  infinitely  extent  ENG-MNG  slabs.  The  two  slabs  have,  respectively,  the 
,  MNGd
 
permittivity 
in the direction of propagation. 
 
The  geometry  of  the  2D  numerical  problem  is  depicted  in  Fig.  1.  Two  planar  slabs  of 
transverse  length  l   are  surrounded  by  the  empty  space  (with  permittivity 
0ε   and 
0μ )  in  a  suitable  Cartesian  reference  system.  These  two  slabs  also  have, 
permeability 
respectively,  the  permittivities 
MNGμ ,  and  the 
,  MNGd
thicknesses 
. The excitation in the figure represents a TM (parallel polarized) 
iθ  with respect to the normal. For simplicity, 
plane wave impinging at a specified angle 
the geometry is independent of  y .  The actual excitation in the 2D simulations was a TM 
Gaussian beam; this provided us with the means to study the localization of the fields in 
the bilayer and beyond it.

The  electric  and  magnetic  plasma  frequencies 

pω   may  be  chosen  so  that  the  two 
materials are, respectively, an ENG and an MNG medium at the driving radian frequency 
dω ,  at  which  the  sinusoidal  signal  is  launched.  The  Drude  models  represented  by  (1) 
satisfy the Kramers-Kronig and causality conditions, as widely discussed in the literature 
(see  e.g.,  [15]),  and  also  the  energy  conservation  requirements  for  passive  ENG  and 
MNG materials. Notice that these models include the presence of losses, represented by 
the collision frequency parameters  Γ , and have a limited band of frequencies in which 
their  constitutive  parameters  are  negative,  consistent  with  the  limitations  exhibited  by 
real-life metamaterials. These models therefore represent valid choices for the following 
analyses.1  Note  that  when  the  materials  are  positive  and  not  less  than  one,  their 
permittivity and permeability parameters are simply taken to be positive constants.

As  was  shown  analytically  in  [1]  for  infinite  transverse  width  slabs,  a 
monochromatic  excitation  of  such  a  ENG-MNG  pair  structure  would  highlight  its 
dω   if  the  two  media  have  complementary 
anomalous  response  at  the  frequency 
properties.  Because  the  slabs  under  consideration  here  are  finite  in  width,  we  expect 
similar  behavior  to  occur  from  this  bilayer  when  the  same  choice  of  the  geometric  and 
constitutive parameters is made provided that the transverse dimension of the pair is large 
.  With satisfaction of these conditions, we expect to achieve 
enough, i.e., 
total tunneling of the radiation through the bilayer with little or no reflection, as well as 
the “growing” evanescent fields inside this pair and the subsequent possibility of virtual 
imaging with sub-wavelength resolution. 
 
It is interesting to note that each of the two slabs per se would not allow propagation at 
the  excitation  frequency,  since  the  wave  number 
  would  be  imaginary  in 
either of them.  Therefore, it is expected that the system would be highly reflective if one 
of  the  two  slabs  was  removed.  On  the  other  hand,  for  the  given  TM  plane  wave 
iθ ,  the  following  conditions,  which  were  derived  in 
impinging  on  the  pair  at  the  angle 
([1], eq. 9), lead to the interface resonance:

dispersion  models  have  also  been  used  in  the  literature  [6,7].    Here,  however,  for  the  sake  of 
mathematical simplicity and faster convergence in the numerical simulations, the Drude model is 
used  for  both  negative  permittivity  and  permeability.  This  choice  does  not  affect  the  general 
conclusions and nature of the results reported here.

These  conditions  ensure  total  tunneling,  zero  reflection  and  complete  phase  and 
amplitude  restoration  between  the  entrance  and  exit  face  of  the  bilayer,  in  the  limit  of 
infinitely wide slabs ( l → ∞ ) and no losses. Similar expressions may be derived for the 
other  polarization  by  invoking  duality.  An  ENG-MNG  pair  illuminated  by  an  incident 
plane  wave  which  is  designed  following  the  resonance  conditions  in  Eq.  (2)  will  be 
denoted  in  the  following  discussion  as  a  conjugate  pair  (or  complementary  pair),  in 
analogy with [1]. 
 
As a special case, a conjugate-matched pair will denote the bilayers in which:

These  conditions  were  shown  in  [1]  to  guarantee  zero-reflection  and  total-transmission 
conditions for any TE or TM plane wave impinging on the pair, i.e., independent of the 
polarization  and  the  angle  of  incidence.  Moreover,  when  evanescent  waves  impinge  on 
such  conjugate-matched  pair,  their  incident amplitudes  are  restored  as well on the back 
side of the bilayer. In [1] it was therefore further speculated that such conjugate-matched 
pairs may act as a virtual image displacer with sub-wavelength resolution, analogous in 
several ways to the perfect lens presented in [8].

TRANSIENT RESPONSE: FDTD SIMULATIONS 
In this section we verify the analytical predictions reported in [1] and briefly discussed in 
the previous section with selected numerical simulations generated with an FDTD engine 
dω   that  is  smoothly  turned  on  at 
(as  in  [2]).  A  sinusoidal  excitation  at  the  frequency 
t =   is  considered  for  both  the  1D  and  2D  simulations.  The  spectrum  of  such  an 
dω ; 
excitation is composed of an infinite number of harmonics centered on the frequency 
this allows one to study the initial transient response of the system and its convergence 
towards the steady-state conditions. 
 
As a first example, we used the 1D simulator to study the behavior of a bilayer that was 
dω . The material parameters for

Fig. 2 shows the electric field distribution inside and outside the bilayer, with a zoom for 
the distribution inside the conjugate matched pair in the figure inset, at two different, but 
close  snapshots  in  time  when  steady-state  has  already  been  achieved.  The  plots  clearly 
show the total tunneling predicted in [1], with the same phase at the entrance and the exit 
face  of  the  bilayer.  Moreover,  it  is  evident  how  at  this  point  in  time  the  “growing-
exponential”  distribution  is  already  present,  consistent  with  the  fact  that  the  wave  is 
evanescent in each of the slabs of the bilayer, but its amplitude and phase is the same at 
the entrance and exit face. Notice the sinusoidal variation in time of the exponential peak 
at the interface between the two layers, which is more evident in the zoom. As mentioned 
above, here and in the following plots some cells in the entrance side of the bilayer (here 
the first 2000 cells) are devoted to show only the reflected (scattered) field, isolated from 
the  impinging  excitation.  As  is  evident,  its  amplitude  is  extremely  low  in  this  case, 
showing  the  total  transmission  typical  of  the  steady-state  regime  for  this  conjugate-
matched pair configuration.

Increasing the thicknesses of the layers to 
, one finds that it takes a 
longer  period  of  time  to  reach  the  steady-state  regime.  A  snapshot  of  the  steady  state 
electric field at 
, a time comparable in the steady state regime to those given 
in Fig. 2, is shown in Fig. 3. Again, the time elapsed from 
t =  is long enough for the 
field inside the bilayer to experience the  growing exponential, even though the level of 
reflection here is higher and the transmission amplitude is not complete.

Fig.  4  shows  the  time  history  for  the  electric  field  values  at  the  entrance  (red  line)  and 
exit (blue line) faces and at the interface (green line) between the two media for the cases 
of Fig. 2 and 3. Here it is evident how the field at the entrance face rapidly converges to 
unity, whereas the interface field, which converges to a higher value due to the growth of 
the  exponential  predicted  theoretically,  requires  a  longer  time  to  reach  the  steady-state, 
consistent with the prediction that the multiple reflections inside the bilayer needs some 
time to build up and achieve a final “growing-exponential” distribution inside the bilayer. 
This  behavior  is  particularly  apparent  in  the  zoom  of  the  first  nanosecond  in  the  two 
figures. It is also consistent with the fact that the spectrum of the excitation is converging 
towards 
dω ,  but  in  the  transient  the  bilayer  is  not  acting  as  a  conjugate-matched  pair, 
since  its  constitutive  parameters  have  different  responses  at  the  different  frequency 
components  of  the  excitation.  With  a  similar  behavior,  also  the  exit  field  converges 
slowly to unity, showing the total tunneling only after a transient period. Comparing the 
two cases of Fig. 4, it is clear how the steady-state regime is reached more slowly when 
thicker slabs are considered, since a larger thickness essentially corresponds to a higher 
resonance Q factor.

These  conclusions  were  further  verified  by  considering  the  2D  case  of  a  very  broad 
Gaussian beam that was normally incident on a bilayer, each slab having the same depth 
as in the 1D examples.  The distribution of the Gaussian beam in the total field-scattered

interaction with the bilayer. In the second snapshot, its interaction has started, but we are 
not yet in the steady-state regime. Here the fields start to build up at the interface between 
the slabs, while a visible, non-negligible reflected wave occurs and consequently creates 
an  interference  pattern  with  the  incident  wave.  Entering  the  steady-state  regime  (third 
snapshot), however, the bilayer becomes totally transparent to the radiation, the fields are 
sensibly  higher  at  the  interface  than  in  the  outside  region,  and  the  reflection  from  the 
bilayer is zero. Notice also how the phase of the plane wave is totally restored at the exit 
face  of  the  bilayer,  as  if  the  structure  were  completely  transparent  to  the  plane  wave 
incidence.

the  steady-state  is  transparent  at  every  angle  of  incidence,  we  verify  again  in  the  last 
snapshot given in Fig. 6 that total tunneling occurs through the bilayer even for this more 
complex excitation. Again, note that the phase-restoration phenomenon is evident in the 
structure.  In  fact,  one  can  see  that  the  Gaussian  beam  actually  tunnels  in  phase  and 
amplitude through the bilayer when the steady state is reached.

We have also considered just a conjugate bilayer, which is designed following Eq. (2) to 
achieve the anomalous total tunneling only at a specific incidence angle. In this case, we 
have  verified  that,  as  predicted  analytically  [1],  only  a  few  of  the  plane  waves  which 
compose  the  Gaussian  spectrum  may  tunnel  through  such  a  bilayer.  Consequently,  a 
reflected wave remains present even after steady-state conditions are reached and a beam

Eq.  (2)  to  have  complete  tunneling  at  the  incidence  angle 

with  a  smaller  angular  spectrum  tunnels  through  the  bilayer  even  in  the  steady-state 
regime.  This case has not been shown here for the sake of brevity. 
 
However, in Fig. 7 we compare the time responses that are generated when a Gaussian 
beam with a waist

,  with  the  one  generated  by  the  same  beam  impinging  on  the 
conjugate-matched bilayer shown in Fig. 6.  From Fig. 7 one can see that steady-state is 
reached later in the conjugate-matched case than in the conjugate case, since more plane 
waves  have  to  contribute  to  the  resonance.  Nonetheless,  the  tunneling  is  eventually 
complete  (same  amplitude  and  phase  at  the  entrance  and  exit  faces).  In  the  conjugate 
case, on the other hand, steady-state is reached more quickly, but the field at the exit face 
is lower than at the entrance face. It is interesting to emphasize, moreover, how the fields 
at  the  interface  get  a  higher  value  in  the  conjugate-matched  case  in  comparison  to  the 
conjugate  one.  This  is  related  again  to  the  different  numbers  of  plane  waves  that  may 
actively  contribute  to  the  resonance.  In  other  words,  the  conjugate  matched  resonance 
indeed shows a higher Q factor keeping fixed the thickness of the bilayer and the losses 
in  the  materials.  (We  remind  the  reader  here  that,  as  shown  in  [1],  a  given  conjugate 
bilayer shows total tunneling at a single incident angle in the steady-state, represented by 
Eq. (2), but a sufficiently high transmission in a given angular region, whose broadness 
depends  on  the  thickness  of  the  bilayer  and  its  other  constitutive  and  geometrical 
parameters.  This  explains  why  the  contribution  from  a  superposition  of  plane  waves  to 
the resonance in the conjugate case is not represented by a single plane wave, but by a 
specific set of them).

conjugate bilayer and on a conjugate-matched one. 

 
In  Fig.  8  we  have  tested  the  possibility  of  employing  the  bilayer  as  a  virtual  image 
displacer, as proposed in [1]. We have considered a line source on one side of the bilayer, 
a distance 
 from it. It is clear from the Fig. 8 that after the time needed 
to  reach  steady-state,  the  phase  and  amplitude  restoration  at  the  exit  side  is  complete, 
allowing for an observer placed on the exit side of the bilayer to “view” the line current

as  if  it  were  closer than it actually is. Also the reflection on the source side is minimal 
once steady-state is reached.

As  a  final  example,  in  Fig.  9  we  have  reported  the  steady-state  regime  electric  field 
distribution  for  the  same  virtual  displacer  as  in  Fig.  8  when  two  sources  with  sub-
wavelength  spacing  are  placed  close  to  the  entrance  side.  The  spacing  between  the 
sources is equal to

ENG-MNG  interface  in  the  plot  and  how  a  blurry,  but  noticeable  resolution  of  the 
sources at the back face is clearly visible. In the figure, the vertical lines correspond to 
the position of the two sources and the horizontal lines delimit the ENG and MNG layers.

CONCLUSIONS 

 
In this contribution, using the FDTD technique we have analyzed thoroughly in the time 
domain the anomalous resonant phenomenon arising when pairing together material slabs 
with opposite signs for the real parts of their constitutive parameters. Complete tunneling, 
total  transparency,  reconstruction  of  evanescent  waves  and  sub-wavelength  virtual 
imaging has been demonstrated numerically to occur after a reasonable time delay, even 
though  each  of  the  two  slabs  by  itself  would  be  essentially  opaque  to  the  incoming 
radiation.  The  effect  works  well  even  with  transversally  finite  slabs  and  excitations, 
potentially  leading  to  interesting  applications  for  imaging  tools.  Physical  insights  and 
dependence of the time response to some of the parameters involved have been discussed.

ABSTRACT 

A  number  of  problems  arise  when  long-range  forces,  such  as  those  governed  by  Bessel  functions,  are  used  in 
particle-particle  simulations.  If  a  simple  cut-off  for  the  interaction  is  used,  the  system  may  find  an  equilibrium 
configuration at zero temperature that is not a regular lattice yet has an energy lower than the theoretically predicted 
minimum  for  the  physical  system.  We  demonstrate  two  methods  to  overcome  these  problems  in  Monte  Carlo and 
molecular dynamics simulations. The first uses a smoothed potential to truncate the interaction in a single unit cell: 
this is appropriate for phenomenological characterisations, but may be applied to any potential. The second is a new 
method  for  summing  the  unmodified  potential  in  an  infinitely  tiled  periodic  system,  which  is  in  excess  of  20,000 
times faster than previous naïve methods which add periodic images in shells of increasing radius: this is suitable for 
quantitative studies. Finally we show that numerical experiments which do not handle the long-range force carefully 
may give misleading results: both of our proposed methods overcome these problems.

1. INTRODUCTION 

Considerable  effort  has  been  invested  in  handling  long-range  forces  for  particle-particle  simulations.  The 
conventional cut-off approach truncates the potential in a single unit cell for separations greater than half the system 
dimension. In general it is better to sum the potential over a number of repeats of the unit cell. Infinite summation 
methods include the Ewald summation [1, 2, 3], multipole methods [4], lattice summation methods [5], the Lekner 
summation method [6, 7] and a novel method for logarithmic interactions [8]. In this paper we review some of the 
problems which can occur when the potential is naïvely truncated, which have not previously been widely reported in 
the  literature.  We  then  derive  two  methods  which  overcome  these  problems.  The  first  is  suitable  for 
phenomenological studies of systems and smooths the potential within a single unit cell. The second is a new real-
space  summation  method  appropriate  for  potentials  governed  by  Bessel  functions.  This  provides  a  speed-up  of  at 
least 20,000 compared to the current method of summing in a series of shells of increasing radius  [9]. 

In  section  2  we  introduce  our  model  system,  which  is  a  simulation  of  a  layered  superconductor.  We  discuss  the 
problems which arise with cutting off this potential in a single unit cell in section 3, and give a simple method of 
smoothing  the  potential  which  overcomes  these  problems  in  section  4.  In  section  5  we  consider an infinitely tiled 
periodic  system  and  derive  our  new  summation  method.  Section  6  describes  a  simulation  of  shearing  a 
superconductor lattice using our new methods and constrasts it with the results obtained when the potential is cut-off. 
We draw our conclusions in section 7. 

2. MODEL SYSTEM 

We will consider the long-range forces which arise in the simulation of pancake vortices in layered high-temperature 
superconductors [10]. The potential is governed by [9, 11, 12, 13, 14]:

Since λ can be several orders of magnitude larger than r [9], the K0 potential has a very long range character. It is 
therefore necessary to either (i) only consider the interaction inside a single unit cell which contains a large number 
of particles, or (ii) sum the interaction over period repeats of the unit cell. 

Our  findings  are  also  of  relevance  to  the  simulation  of  other  systems  governed  by  long-range  forces  such  as  the 
interaction  of  electrically  charged  rods  [8].  We  will  show  results  for  Monte  Carlo  and  Molecular  Dynamics 
simulations  where  the  two-dimensional  unit  cell  geometry  can  be  chosen  to  be  a  rectangle,  a  parallelogram  or  a 
hexagon. In all cases periodic boundary conditions are employed.  

3. CUT-OFF POTENTIAL 

The standard approach is to cut-off the potential to be constant outside a circle of radius equal to min(Lx / 2,  Ly / 2), 
where Lx and Ly are the lengths of the sides of the unit cell. Since the force is the gradient of the potential, it is zero 
outside the cut-off radius. We then define the distance between particles, r, to be the minimum image distance [3].  

In figure 1 the real force dependence F(r) is compared to that for a simulation system with a simple geometrical cut-
off. For vortices in superconductors, Abrikosov [15] demonstrated theoretically that the lowest energy configuration 
for  an  infinite  lattice  is  the  hexagonal  lattice,  or  so-called  Abrikosov  lattice,  with  an  associated  Abrikosov  lattice 
energy.  However,  when  using a sharp cut-off in our simulations we find many configurations with energies lower 
than the Abrikosov lattice energy. 

Figure  2  shows  the  results  from  a  Molecular  Dynamics  simulation  of  a  small  number  of  particles  in  which  the 
temperature in the system is cycled from 0K to half the melting temperature of the vortex solid and is then returned 
to  0K.  The  temperature  is  introduced  via  a  stochastic  noise  term.  The  Delaunay  triangulation  of  the  vortex 
configuration  at  the  end  of  the  simulation  in  figure  2  is  elastically  deformed.  Detailed  examination  of  the 

 

EFFICIENT METHODS FOR HANDLING LONG-RANGE FORCES

triangulation  shows  that  the  elastic  deformations  arise  due  to  particles  gathering  on  the  boundaries  of  the  cut-off 
circles. In this position they minimise their contribution to the energy (or force) in the system. This gives rise to the 
“wavy lines” visible in figure 2, with a curvature characterised by the cut-off radius. To demonstrate this, we have 
shown  the  cut-off  circles  corresponding  to  two  of  the  particles.  The  wavy lines are less evident in larger systems, 
since their curvature is inversely proportional to the cut-off radius. 

If the system is heated above its melting temperature and then annealed slowly the final equilibrium state (i) has an 
energy  lower  than  the  Abrikosov  energy,  and  (ii)  contains  topological  defects.  A  topological  defect  is  a  particle 
which  does  not  have  six  nearest  neighbours  in  the  Delaunay  triangulation.  We  have  repeated  these  results  for 
Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations with up to 2000 particles. The result in figure 3 for a Monte Carlo 
simulation of a system annealed from a liquid state exhibits low energy and contains defects. We have verified that 
our results are independent of the geometry of the unit cell (rectangular, parallelogram, or hexagonal). 

These problems are clearly artificial, and are caused by imposing a sharp cut-off on the very long range nature of the 
interaction. Since the penetration depth, λ, is generally much larger than the lattice spacing it would require systems 
with several hundred thousand particles before the effects of this finite size problem began to become less significant. 
Methods to deal with such large systems with the Bessel function interaction potential are currently being developed 
[16]. 

In  studies  of  high  temperature  superconductors,  interest  has  recently  developed  in  the  formation  of  topologically 
ordered states which exhibit quasi-long range translational order: the so-called Bragg glass. These states occur when 
the  vortices  are  weakly  pinned  and  have  been  investigated  both  theoretically  and  experimentally  [17,  18].  Other 
studies  have  focussed  on  the  structural  properties  of  the  dynamics  of  vortex  systems  [19,  20].  In  both  cases  it  is 
important  that  the  ground  state  for  an  unpinned  system  should  be  a  hexagonal  lattice  without  topological  defects. 
Furthermore for the calculation of numerical phase diagrams as a function of disordering pinning, it is vital that the 
disorder is not introduced by the model itself. 

We  therefore  propose  two  methods  which  avoid  the  problems  described  above.  The  first  involves  modifying  the 
potential  near  to  the  cut-off,  and  allows  qualitative  simulation  of  small  systems  using  only  a  single  unit  cell.  The 
second  is  a  new  fast  summation  method  to  allow  the  infinitely  tiled  periodic  system  to  be  considered  and  allow 
quantitative simulations to be performed. 

4. SMOOTHED POTENTIAL 

In  figure  4  (left)  we  show  the  force  field  experienced  by  a  vortex  due  to  its  surrounding  particles  in  a  hexagonal 
configuration. The discontinuities are caused by the artificial step in the force function shown in figure 1. It is natural 
to introduce a smoothed potential, which reduces the force smoothly to zero over a region from rfade to rcut-off, and we 
impose C1 continuity of the force at r = rfade and r = rcut-off. The smoothed potential is shown in figure 1, with the 
resulting smooth force field in figure 4 (right). The smoothing distance rcut-off - rfade is a free parameter which should 
be  kept  as  small  as  possible  to  maintain  the  original  force  over  the largest possible range. Numerical experiments 
show  that  three  lattices  spacings  is  sufficient.  Figure  5  shows  the  results  of  a  Monte  Carlo  simulation  using  a 
similarly smoothed energy. Simulations using this modified potential do not find configurations below the Abrikosov 
energy and topological defects only occur when the system is annealed very rapidly. 

The interpretation is that due to the slow force change at the cut-off (enforced by the derivative being zero) a particle 
pair separated by a distance of roughly rcut-off experiences continuous and small changes in force if their positions are 
perturbed.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  large  discontinuous  fluctuations,  which  can  enable  the  system  to  discover 
configurations with energies less than the Abrikosov energy. We have also used interpolating polynomials of higher 
order and an exponential function in the smoothing region: in all cases the system does not discover energy states 
below the Abrikosov energy. 

It is important to consider whether the modification of the original force with the smooth cut-off affects the system’s 
behaviour. Using a cut-off to the long-range interaction is a major change of the long-range interaction. However, 
introducing the smoothing distance and altering the force in the region between rfade and rcut-off cannot be worse than 
using  a  slightly  smaller  system  with  r’cut-off  =  rfade.  The  enormous  advantage  of  using  a  smooth  cut-off  is  that  the 
structural properties of the system can be simulated correctly and that the lowest energy configuration is identical to 
the theoretical ground state. For studies of the dynamics of vortices, recent results show that the precise details of the 
long-range  particle  interaction  are  not  crucial  [13].  We  therefore  recommend  the  smoothed  potential  for 
phenomenological characterisation of superconductors.

5. FAST INFINITE SUMMATION 

An alternative approach to modifying the potential is to sum the potential function over periodic repeats of the unit 
cell,  which  provides  the  best  representation  of  the  system  given  only  a  finite  number  of  particles.  We  write  the 
potential (1) in the form: [9]

2 ≤ Nm

where mx and my are integers and Lx and Ly are the lengths of the edges of the simulation cell. This is truncated such 
2; we sum the potential in shells of increasing radius, Nm, until it has converged. Following Ryu et 
that mx
al  [9]  we  will  use  a  value  for  the  penetration  depth,  λ,  at  0K  of  7700  ∆  for  Mo77Ge23.  We  will  return  to  the 
temperature dependence of λ later. In figure 6, we show the exponentially fast convergence of the energy between 
two particles in a simulation of 300 vortices in the Abrikosov lattice state as more image cells are included. We also 
show  the  time  taken  to  perform  this  calculation on a 450 MHz Pentium II using Compaq (Digital) Visual Fortran 
under Windows NT 4.0. For the particle-particle energy to converge to a relative error better than 1×10-8 requires Nm 
~ 300, which takes ~ 300,000 calls to the K0 function. This ensures that the total system energy is accurate to better 
than 0.01%. 

We now derive a new method to perform this infinite summation. In figure 7 we have:

Equations (8) and (9) have the remarkable property that the coefficients corresponding to the infinite summation over 
the  periodic  repeats  of  the  unit  cell  can  be  pre-computed.  This  reduces  the  double  summation  in  (3)  to  a  single 
summation. Furthermore, due to the exponential convergence of the Gegenbauer addition formulae, the sum may be 
truncated  at  ktrunc  ~  5  –  20  terms.  A  further  factor  of  two  in  performance  can  be  obtained  by  using  symmetry  to 
convert the summation from k = -∞ …∞ to the range k = 0 …∞. 
The form (8) closely resembles a Fourier type summation method, yet the whole calculation proceeds in real space in 
contrast  to  the  Ewald  summation  method  [22].  Our  proposed  method  couples  directly  to  a  multipole  method  for 
computing the interaction energy inside the unit cell in O(N) time [16], which is based on the Gegenbauer addition 
formulae, rather than a Taylor series expansion. Our O(N) method provides further speedup when there are more than 
~1200 particles in the unit cell. This is analogous to the method described in [5], which couples a lattice summation 
method with a multipole method based on Taylor series. It is certainly not appropriate to use the method proposed in 
[8],  which  sums  a  genuinely  logarithmic  potential  over  infinite  repeats  of  the  unit  cell,  since  the  logarithmic 
approximation to the K0 potential is only valid for small r as shown in (2).  
The convergence of the energy between two particles in the Abrikosov lattice is identical to the convergence shown 
in figure 6 as we add more terms to the calculation of the coefficients ck and sk. We have chosen the case of two 
nearest neighbours, which yields the slowest convergence of (8) since z takes its smallest value.  
In a superconductor, λ is a function of the temperature. For our model system (Mo77Ge23) λ(T) = λ(0) / (1-T / Tc)1/2 
[9], where Tc = 5.63K is the critical temperature at which the material loses its superconducting properties. Hence the 
coefficients ck and sk need to be re-computed at each temperature. As the temperature increases additional image cells 
need to be included in both (3) and the pre-computation (9). The crucial difference, however, between (3) and (8) is 
that the time taken to evaluate the energy using (8) remains constant once the coefficients are available, whereas the 
naïve summation requires considerable numbers of additional image cells to converge to the solution. In figure 8 we 
show  the  speedup  of  our  method  when  computing  the  energy  between two particles at a fixed accuracy of 1×10-5 
(relative to the energy computed to machine accuracy by either method). In all cases the resulting energies are shown 
to be identical to the stated accuracy. At 0K and using 5 terms in the truncation of (8), we have a speedup of 20,000 
over the naïve summation method. This rises to 400,000 for temperatures approaching Tc. If the particle energy is 
required  to  be  accurate  to  1×10-8,  then,  using  30  coefficients,  the  speedups  are  between  50,000  (T  =  0K)  and 
1,000,000 (T ~ Tc). 
Since  the  coefficients  ck  and  sk  depend  on  λ  (and  hence  temperature);  the  method  may  appear  to  be  costly  if  the 
temperature  is  changed  at  every  Molecular  Dynamics  or  Monte  Carlo  step.  We  now  discuss  several  ways  to 
overcome this. Firstly, it is possible to perform simulations at a small number of temperatures and use the data from 
these to obtain information about the behaviour of the system as a continuous function of temperature [23, 24]. Thus 
improving the sophistication of the analysis of the results can reduce the number coefficients ck and sk which need to 
be pre-calculated. Secondly it is possible to compute the ck and sk at a small set of temperatures and use interpolation 
to derive their values at other temperatures. Finally, since only ~5-20 coefficients are needed, it is straightforward to 
compute once and store on disk the values of ck and sk for each temperature to be explored. These values will be re-
used a large number of times in a typical set of numerical simulations. 

We implement (8) using a recurrence relation [25] for the trigonometric terms and a vendor-optimised vector Bessel 
function. Goertzel’s algorithm [26] could be employed for additional efficiency, though the improvement is likely to 
be marginal. The remarkable speedup obtained is due to the fixed work equivalent to roughly five calls to a Bessel 
function  routine  required  for  (8),  compared  to  ~100,000  calls  required  for  (3)  (at  0K).  The  five  calls  are:  two  to 
initialise the Bessel recurrence, one to evaluate the contribution from the unit cell, and the equivalent of roughly a 
further two for the remaining trigonometric terms. Our infinite summation is correspondingly five times slower than 
using  the  smoothed  potential  in  a  single  unit  cell,  which  requires  evaluation  of  a  single  Bessel  function  or  a 
polynomial. This is confirmed by experiments. For simulations using the fast infinite lattice summation, results are 
similar  to  those  of  figure  5.  The  infinite  lattice  summation  method  is  suitable  for  quantitative  studies  of 
superconductors.

6. RESULTS 

In  the  previous  sections  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  phenomenological  potential  and  the  infinitely  summed 
potential ensure that the Abrikosov lattice is the minimum energy configuration for our system. We now show that 
the presence of dislocations, which also results from incorrect handling of the long-range potential, seriously affects 
study of the elastic properties of a lattice. For superconductors the structure of the lattice determines the static and 
dynamic properties of the vortex lattice. This is known from experimental [27, 28] and theoretical work [29]. The 
simulation potential should not introduce dislocations, since this will affect the onset of plasticity in the lattice which 
is directly related to characterising current-voltage behaviour, and thus to applications. 

We have considered a simulation of shearing of a hexagonal lattice, which is a simplified version of the simulations 
required to perform current-voltage characterisations. Inset (a) in figure 9 shows a Delaunay triangulation for half the 
simulation  cell  demonstrating  the  experimental  set-up:  a  shearing  force  is  applied  to  the  central  row  of  particles 
marked  by  black  points,  and  the  particles  marked  by  open  circles  are  not allowed to move in the x-direction. The 
main diagram shows the resulting change in energy as a response to the shearing force. The upper part of the figure 
shows data for the smooth cut-off, with the lower part showing the results for the sharp cut-off. The smooth cut-off 
and the infinite lattice summation produce the expected behaviour: with increasing shear stress the energy increases. 
The  slope  of  the  energy-change  as  a  function  of  the  displacement  characterises  the  shear  elastic  modulus  of  the 
crystal. Inset (b1) shows a triangulation of a system which has been slightly tilted by the applied force. In contrast, 
employing the sharp cut-off the energy decreases for applied shear stress, i.e. the material appears to collapse after 
applying a shearing force (inset b2)! 

Insets (c1) and (c2) show the time evolution of the local hexatic order,

In (c1), which shows the smoothed potential, 

Ψ decreases continuously until a static state is reached, reflecting the 
Ψ  drops suddenly to 
shearing of the system. The energy data is taken from these static states. In (c2) (sharp cut-off) 
a  much  smaller  value,  representing  the  sudden  change  to  configurations  similar  to  those  shown  in  (b2).  Thus,  the 
mechanical properties of the lattice using a sharp cut-off are severely affected by the incorrect handling of the long-
range  potential:  this  would  seriously  affect  numerical  simulations  aimed  at  studying  elastic  properties  of 
superconductors. The smooth cut-off and the infinite lattice sum produce the correct physical behaviour and can be 
used  in  more  complex  numerical  simulations  for  phenomenological  (smoothed  potential)  or  quantitative  (infinite 
summation) study of the dynamic phase diagram of the superconductor lattice [30, 31].

7. CONCLUSIONS 

For  Monte  Carlo  and  Molecular  Dynamics  simulations  using  long-range  interactions  subject  to  periodic  boundary 
conditions, a sharp cut-off for the interaction energy (or force) can yield misleading results. We have considered the 
case of superconductors, in which the potential is governed by a Bessel function. Monte Carlo simulations are often 
used to study phase diagrams numerically and it is vital that the phase behaviour of the system is not affected by the 
model itself. We find that using a sharp cut-off the system can find irregular lattice configurations with an energy 
below  the  theoretical  ground  state  of  a  regular  hexagonal  lattice.  In  Molecular  Dynamics  study  of  the  dynamical 
phase diagram of the material can be dramatically affected by incorrect handling of the long-range potential. 

We have presented two methods which overcome these problems. The first is suitable for phenomenological studies 
of  systems  and  uses  a  smoothed  potential,  but  still  truncates  the  interaction  over  a  single  unit  cell.  Annealing  a 
system governed by this modified potential yields a perfect hexagonal lattice which is the global energy minimum. 
This is the least computationally expensive option and is applicable to any potential. The second sums the interaction 
over the infinitely tiled unit cell and is suitable for quantitative system studies. Previous methods for performing this 
add the tiled images in a series of shells of increasing radius. We have shown that with the pre-computation of a set 
of  Fourier  type  coefficients,  the  whole  infinite  summation  can  be  computed  using  a  summation  which  converges 
exponentially fast and results in a speedup of between 20,000 and 1,000,000 over the naïve summation, depending on 
the range of the interaction and the desired accuracy. The derivation of the summation proceeds in real space, and the 
results converge exactly to those obtained from other summation methods. This is roughly five times as slow as using 
the smoothed potential, but is the most accurate method for systems of finite size. We will report elsewhere on the

results of systems we have studied using our methods [30, 31] and also on a method for evaluating the energy within

A long-range force (i) Full force (ii) Force cut-off at a distance rcut-off (iii) Smoothed force. Distances are measured in 
multiples of the ground-state lattice spacing. 

 

Figure 2 

Left:  Molecular  Dynamics  simulation  of  90  particles  using  a  cut-off  potential,  which  start  in  a  hexagonal 
configuration at 0K (with Abrikosov lattice energy, Ea), are heated to half their melting temperature (Tm) and then 
returned  to  0K.  Temperature  is  introduced  via a stochastic noise term. The system finds a new configuration with 
energy  lower  than  the  energy  of  the  regular lattice. Right: Delaunay triangulation of the final configuration of the 
particles at time step 5000. Two cut-off circles are shown to demonstrate that particles align along these circles.

Figure 3 

Monte  Carlo  simulation  of  432  particles  using  a  conventional  cut-off  potential.  The  system  starts  in  a  regular 
hexagonal Abrikosov lattice and is heated above its melting point to ~ 3Tm then annealed slowly to zero temperature 
in steps of 0.015Tm each of 5000 sweeps. Left: The energy of the system drops below the Abrikosov lattice energy, 
Ea. Right: Delaunay triangulation of the final disordered configuration. The topological defects are circled. 

 

Figure 4 

The magnitude of the force field a particle at position (0,0) experiences from a system of 418 particles using (left) the 
sharp cut-off and (right) the smooth cut-off. The effect of smoothing the potential is to remove the discontinuities in 
the force.

Monte Carlo simulation of 432 particles using a potential smoothed over three lattice spacings. Left: The energy of 
the  system  never  drops  below  the  Abrikosov  lattice  energy,  Ea.  Right:  Delaunay  triangulation  of  the  final 
configuration shows the system has a hexagonal ground state. 

 

Figure 6 

Fractional error (E∞ - En)/E∞ and time taken to compute the energy En between two particles separated by a single 
lattice  spacing  in  an  infinitely  tiled  periodic  system  when n  image  cells  are  used.  E∞  is  estimated  by allowing the 
summation to converge to machine accuracy.

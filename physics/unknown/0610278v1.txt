ABSTRACT 

 
Femtosecond  laser  ablation  of  Ti,  Zr  and  Hf  has  been  investigated  by  means  of  in-situ  plasma 
diagnostics. Fast plasma imaging with the aid of an intensified charged coupled device (ICCD) camera 
was  used  to  characterise  the  plasma  plume  expansion  on  a  nanosecond  time  scale.  Time-  and  space-
resolved optical emission spectroscopy was employed to perform time-of-flight measurements of ions 
and  neutral  atoms.  It  is  shown  that  two  plasma  components  with  different  expansion  velocities  are 
generated by the ultra-short laser ablation process. The expansion behaviour of these two components 
has been analysed as a function of laser fluence and target material. The results are discussed in terms 
of mechanisms responsible for ultra-short laser ablation.

1. INTRODUCTION 

 
Ultra-fast  laser  ablation  is  of  growing  interest  pushed  by  applications  like  high  precision 
micromachining, micro-analysis of materials, pulsed laser deposition of thin films, etc … . Compared 
to ablation with nanosecond laser sources, the thermal damage of the material is strongly reduced when 
using ultra-short laser pulses because of the much lower thermal heat diffusion into the material bulk 
[1].  Several  theoretical  models  were  proposed  to  describe  ultra-fast  laser  ablation.  These  models 
involve  different  ablation  mechanisms  like  thermal  ablation  [2],  electrostatic  ablation  [3],  Coulomb 
explosion [4], phase explosion [5], etc … . Although significant progress has been obtained during the 
past  few  years  in  the  research  field  of  ultra-fast  laser-matter  interaction,  there  is  still  a  lack  of 
knowledge.  In  this  context,  the  present  study  is  an  experimental  approach,  based  on  analyses  of  the 
laser-induced plasma, to get a better insight in the fundamental physics of ultra-fast laser ablation.  
 
 
 

2. EXPERIMENT 

 
A  scheme  of  the  experimental  arrangement  is  given  in  figure  1.  Ablation  experiments  have  been 
performed  using  a  Ti:Sapphire  laser  (Spectraphysics,  model  Hurricane)  delivering  pulses  of  100 fs 
duration, 1 mJ energy at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. A spot of uniform energy distribution and 30 µm 
diameter  has  been  obtained  on  the  target  surface  by  imaging  a  1.5 mm  aperture  by  a  lens  of  50 mm 
focal  length.  The  laser  beam  energy  was  varied  with  the  aid  of  calibrated  attenuating  plates.  The 
number  of  applied  laser  pulses  has  been  controlled  with  the  aid  of  a  mechanical  shutter.  Both  the 
fundamental laser wavelength (λlas = 800 nm) and the second harmonic (λlas = 400 nm) have been used 
in  the  experiments.  The  second harmonic was  generated  by  a  B.B.O.  crystal.  The  metal  targets  were 
placed in a stainless steel vacuum chamber with a 10−4 Pa residual pressure. The vacuum chamber is 
equipped with 4 quartz windows for the laser beam pathing through and optical accessing. Inside the 
chamber,  target  holder  and  focusing  lens  are  mounted  on  motorised  translation  axes.  The  focusing 
distance and the target position were controlled with the aid of a CCD camera by capturing the target 
surface  through  the  focusing  lens.  The  latter  was  protected  by  thin  glass  plates  against  deposition  of 
ablated material. The glass plates were changed regularly to avoid perturbation of the laser beam by the 
deposit.  During  most  of  the  experiments,  the  chamber  was  filled  with  He  at  500 Pa  pressure.  The 
background gas was introduced in order to reduce the deposition rate on the glass plates. However, the 
pressure was low enough to avoid perturbation of the ablation process by the He atmosphere. 
Fast  plasma  imaging  has  been  performed  with  the  aid  of  a  focusing  objective  (Tamron  70-
210 mm, 1:3.8-4) and a fast intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) (Andor, iStar). The temporal and 
spatial  resolution  of  these  measurements  were  about  5 ns  and  60 µm,  respectively.  For  spectroscopic

with  respect  to  the  target 
surface  varied  by  displacing 
the  f = 400 mm  lens  along 
the  z-axis.  A  fast  intensified 
device 
coupled 
charge 
(Princeton Instruments, model 576/RB-E) with a variable gate (≥ 5 ns) was placed at the spectrometer 
output  for  photon  detection.  Using  the  first  order  of  the  spectrometer  grating,  a  spectral  window  of 
about  6 nm  was  observed  with  a  spectral  resolution  of λ/Δλ = 1×104  (Δλ = 0.05 nm  at λ = 500 nm). 
The spatial resolution of the lateral x−position, perpendicular to the laser beam axis, was about 22 µm. 
Synchronisation between laser and ICCD detector was ensured using the Pockels cells pulse generator 
trigger output of the femtosecond amplifier. The time jitter between laser and detector gate was about 
± 1 ns.  ICCD  detector  and  spectrometer  were  connected  to  a  microcomputer  for  data  acquisition  and 
spectra  analysis.  In  order  to  enhance  the  signal  to  noise  ratio,  data  acquisition  was  performed  by 
averaging  the  signal  over  102  or  more  successive  laser  shots.  During  the  recordings,  the  target  was 
translated perpendicularly to the laser beam with a velocity of 30 µm s−1 in order to maintain the laser-
material interaction stable. An observation gate of 5 ns or 10 ns was used during most experiments. The 
time  delay  t  between  laser  pulse  and  observation  gate  was  varied  with  the  aid  of  a  delayed  pulse 
generator.  According  to  the  available  maximum  energy  of  20 µJ  at  800  nm,  a  maximum  fluence  of 
3 Jcm-2 was obtained. For the second harmonic, the maximum fluence was 1.6 Jcm-2.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

 
3.1. Fast plasma imaging 
 
The thermo-physical properties of Ti, Zr and Hf are listed in table 1. It is noted that the three metals, 
which  are  situated  in  the  same  column  of  the  periodic  table  of  elements,  have  similar  optical  and 
thermo-physical properties, but different atomic mass. Most of the experiments have been carried out in 
He background gas of 500 Pa pressure for two reasons. First, the presence of the background gas leads 
to a reduced deposition rate on the lens protecting glass plates. Second, collisions between the ablated 
vapour species and atoms lead to higher excitation rates and therefore a higher detection efficiency of 
the plasma species. However, it is emphasised that the pressure was low enough to avoid perturbation 
of the ablation process by the He atmosphere.

Plasma  images  recorded  during  ablation  of  Ti  in  500 Pa  He  produced  by  λlas = 400 nm  (second 
harmonic)  laser  pulses  are  presented  in  figure  2  for  different  laser  fluences  Flas  and  different  time 
delays  t  between  the  laser  pulse  and  the  observation  gate.  The  intensity  scaling  (see  caption  for 
Flas = 1.6 Jcm-2,  t = 20 ns)  has  been  adjusted  to  the  maximum  intensity  value  for  every  image.  It  is 
noted that the plasmas emission intensity is a strongly decreasing function of time (over several orders 
of magnitude during 1 µs). The target position is indicated on each image by a vertical black bar. At 
t = 20 ns, the plasma is located in a volume of about 0.2 mm diameter in the vicinity of the irradiated 
area  of  the  targets  surface 
for  all  laser fluences.  Later, 
at  50 ns,  two  regions  of 
plasma

obtained  from  the  images  by  averaging  over  several  lines  as  shown  in  the  insight  of  figure  3.  It  is 
shown that the intensity profile for t = 20 ns already allows one to distinguish between the two plasma 
components.  However,  the  spatial  separation  between  both  components  is  weak.  Therefore,  an 
identification of  both  components  on  the  image  was  not possible  for t = 20 ns. With increasing  time, 
both components show a different expansion behaviour with respect to the z-axis. The fast component 
has  an  intensity  maximum  that  propagates  in  time  towards  higher  distances.  Contrarily,  the  slow 
component is characterised by an intensity maximum that remains close to the targets surface whereas 
the  intensity  distribution  expands  towards  higher  distances.  The  most  probable  velocity  of  the  slow 
plasma component is about one order of magnitude lower than that of the fast one. 
To make sure that the observation of the two plasma components are not an artefact of our experiment 
but  a  consequence  of  the  ultra-short  laser  ablation  process  itself,  we  have  performed  a  series  of 
complementary measurements. First, the influence of the applied number of laser pulses on the same 
surface area has been investigated. As indicated in section 2, the plasma images have been recorded by 
averaging  over  several  laser  ablation  events.  This  has  been  done  by  applying  a  laser  pulse  sequence 
onto target which was translated continuously with a velocity of 30 µm s−1. Thus, according to the laser 
spot  diameter  of  30 µm s−1, 
every  surface  area  was 
submitted  to  irradiation  by 
103 
laser  pulses.  For  a

ultra-fast  laser  systems  do 
not generate a single perfect 
laser  pulse  of  100 fs  pulse 
duration.  The  laser  pulse 
has not a gaussian temporal 
shape. It is characterised by 
a fast intensity increase and 
exponential 
an 
intensity decay. That means that the ultra-short pulse is accompanied by radiation on a picosecond or 
nanosecond  time  scale  of  much  lower  intensity.  Furthermore,  laser  systems  with  a  regenerative 
amplifier  generate  a  pre-pulse  which  precedes  the  main  pulse  by  one  or  several  nanoseconds.  The 
intensity ratio between main- and pre-pulse (pre-pulse contrast) is about 103 for the laser system used in 
our experiment. In order to avoid problems related to the intensity contrast, we carried out most of the 
experiments by using the second harmonic of the laser beam at λlas = 400 nm. The non-linear frequency 
conversion strongly increases the contrast. In figure 4 are presented intensity profiles for different time 
delay  which  have  been  recorded  for  similar  experimental  conditions  as  those  presented  in  figure  3. 
Dislike to figure 3 (ablation with λ = 400 nm, 1.6 Jcm-2), figure 4 presents results obtained with laser 
pulses at the fundamental wavelength at λ = 800 nm and a fluence of 3.0 Jcm-2. Comparing figures 3 
and  4,  we  observe  a  similar  behaviour  for  ablation  with  both  the  fundamental  wavelength  and  the 
second harmonic. In particular, at λ = 800 nm (figure 4) the slow and the fast plasma components are 
identified.  Both  have  similar  expansion  and  propagation  velocities  as  those  observed  at λ = 400 nm 
(figure 3). As the contrast at the fundamental laser wavelength is much lower than that of the second 
harmonic, it is concluded that the observed plasma propagation behaviour is not an artefact resulting 
from a low contrast of the used laser source. 
The  third  possible  origin  of  a  two  component  formation  in  the  ablation  plume  may  come  from  the 
interaction with the surrounding low pressure gas. Although the mean free path of the ablated species 
in He at a pressure of 500 Pa is about 100 µm and the effect of the gas on the plume is expected to be 
small  during  the  early  expansion  stage,  we  performed  complementary  measurements  in  vacuum  to 
exclude any doubt on the origin of the observed plasma behaviour. In figure 5 are presented intensity 
profiles  for  different  time  delay  which  have  been  recorded  for  experimental  conditions  identical  to 
those of figure 3, except of the ambient gas pressure which was reduced to 10-4 Pa. It is seen that both 
slow  and  fast  plasma  components  are  still  observed  in  vacuum  and  are  thus  not  produced  by  the 
interaction  of  the  ablation  plume  with  the  low  pressure  gas  atmosphere.  It  is  however  noted,  that  in 
vacuum,  the  emission  intensity  of  the  fast  component  strongly  decreases  for  t > 200 ns.  This  is 
attributed to the fact, that the density of the expanding plasma plume density strongly diminishes as a 
function of time. Thus, the collision frequencies decrease and the excitation rates are small during the 
later  expansion  stage  in  vacuum.  We  observed,  however,  that  the  excitation  rates  in  presence  of  an 
ambient gas are increased due to collisions between ablated vapour species and ambient gas atoms. 
Figure 6 shows intensity profiles for different laser fluences and two different delay times. The times 
t = 20 (a)  and  400 ns  (b)  are  chosen  to  show  the  influence  of  laser  fluence  on  the  fast  and  the  slow 
plasma  component,  respectively.  All  intensity  profiles  are  normalised  with  respect  to  its  maximum 
intensity to allow an easy comparison of the curve shapes. The maximum intensities are given in the 
figure in counts s-1. It is observed that for Flas ≥ 0.7 Jcm−2 the intensity distribution attributed to the fast 
component  (a)  has  a  similar  shape  which  indicates  that  the  corresponding  propagation  velocity  is 
independent  of  Flas  in  this  fluence  range.  However,  for  Flas < 0.7 Jcm−2,  the  intensity  distribution 
becomes  more  narrow  showing  that  the  average  propagation  velocity  of  the  fast  component  is

effect  is  particularly  important  for  laser  ablation  with  nanosecond  laser  pulses  where  the  laser  pulse 
interacts  with  the  plasma  plume  and  heats  up  the  ablated  material.  Assuming  a  linear  dependence 
between laser fluence and ablation rate, the number of emitters increases linearly with Flas. For constant

optically thin or optically thick plasma, respectively. However, the intensity increase observed in figure 
6 (a) for t = 20 ns is characterised by β > 1 and thus is stronger than the expected variation for constant 
T. The temperature thus is supposed to increase with laser fluence.  
Intensity profiles of plasma emission recorded during ablation of Ti, Zr and Hf are presented in figure 7 
for  t = 100  (a)  and  500 ns  (b).  It  is  noted  that  with  respect  to  the  emission  intensity  of  the  fast 
component  of  Ti,  those  of  Zr  and  Hf  are  much  weaker.  This  indicates,  that  the  proportion  of  fast 
species  with  respect  to  slow  ones  is  reduced  for  the  heavier  metals.  Furthermore,  the  more  narrow 
intensity  shapes  of  the  fast  components  of  Zr  and  Hf  show  that  the  attributed  average  velocities  are 
reduced with respect to the lighter Ti (see figure 7 (a)). The expansion velocity of the slow component 
depends only very weakly on the atomic mass of the ablated material (see figure 7 (b)). For a thermal 
ablation mechanism, the expansion velocity depends on atomic mass as u ∝ M-1/2. The observed weaker 
dependence  may  be  explained  by  an  increase  of  plasma  temperature  with  the  atomic  mass.  This  is  a 
reasonable assumption, because for the Ti, Zr and Hf, the evaporation temperature increases with M.   
 
 
3.2. Optical emission spectroscopy 
 
Typical emission spectra of the plasma generated by laser ablation of Zr are presented in figure 8. The 
spectra  have  been  recorded  at  a  distance  of  150 µm  from  target  for  t = 30  (a)  and 70 ns  (b).  It  is 
observed that the relative intensity of spectral line emission of ions with respect to that of neutral atoms 
is  higher  at  early  times.  This  shows  that  the  ionisation  temperature  is  higher  for  the  faster  plasma 
species.  As  a  general  result,

and  to  a  time  delay  tmax  corresponding  to  the  maximum  intensity  of  ionic  spectral  lines.  Thus,  the 
intensity measurements correspond to the highly ionised plasma front which precedes the majority of 
neutral  atoms.  As  stated  before,  the  emission  intensity  of  both  neutral  and  ionic  emission  strongly 
increases with Flas in the lower fluence range (Flas ≤ 0.9 Jcm−2). For larger fluences, the ratio remains 
roughly constant. It is stressed that the fluence value of 0.9 Jcm−2, corresponding to the change of the 
intensity  increase  with  Flas  ,  is  about  one  order  of  magnitude  larger  than  the  ablation  threshold.

4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 

 
The  present  results  obtained  by  fast  ICCD  plasma  imaging  and  time-  and  space-resolved  optical 
emission spectroscopy show that the plasma generated by ultra-short laser ablation of Ti, Zr and Hf is 
characterised  by  two  well-distinguished  components.  A  fast  component  formed  by  ions  and  neutral 
atoms  propagates  with  a  most  probable  velocity  of  the  order  of  106 cm s−1  and  an  opening  angle  of 
about 20 to 30°. A slow component has a very wide opening angle (≥ 80°) and an average expansion 
velocity of the order of 105 cm s−1. It has been shown that the formation of these two components is 
neither due the interaction of the ablated material with the low-pressure He atmosphere nor an artefact 
produced  by  an  eventual  too  low  contrast  of  the  femtosecond  laser  pulse.  The  behaviour  of  both 
components has been studied as a function laser fluence and target material. Ti, Zr and Hf have similar 
thermophysical  properties  but  different  atomic  mass.  The  propagation  velocity  was  found  to  vary  as 
up ∝ M-1/2  so  that  the  kinetic  energy  was  independent  of  M.  The  slow  component  showed  a  weak 
increase of kinetic energy with M. The behaviour is an indication of a thermal ablation process because 
the  evaporation  temperature  -  and  therefore  the  expected  initial  plasma  temperature  -  of  the  three 
metals increases with M.  
The  emission  spectra  of  the  three  metals  revealed  spectral  lines  of  single-charged  ions  and  neutral 
atoms. Even for the highest laser fluence of 3 Jcm-2, which is about 30 times higher than the ablation 
threshold, no double-charged ions were detected. Furthermore, the emission intensity of ionic spectral 
lines  and  intensity  ratio  between  lines  of  ions  and  atoms  in  the  fast  propagating  plasma  front  were 
independent on laser fluence in the range from 1.2 to 3 Jcm-2. This behaviour is quite different from 
that observed during nanosecond laser ablation where the plasma temperature and thus the ionisation 
degree  strongly  increases  with  Flas  due  to  plasma  heating  via  inverse  Bremsstrahlung  [10].  It  can  be 
related to energy losses due to fast electron heat diffusion into the material bulk which is supposed to 
play  an  important  role  in  the  femtosecond  ablation  process  in  the  fluence  regime  Flas ≥ 1 Jcm-2  [11]. 
However, a clear identification of both plasma components is not possible at this stage of our study and 
complementary  measurements  are  planned  to  get  a  better  understanding  of  the  mechanisms  involved 
into the ultra-fast laser ablation process.

Abstract 

Empirically correlated density matrices of N-electron systems are investigated. Exact 

closed-form  expressions  are  derived  for  the  one-  and  two-electron  reduced  density  matrices 

from  a  general  pairwise  correlated  wave  function.  Approximate  expressions  are  proposed 

which reflect dispersive interactions between closed-shell centro-symmetric subsystems. Said 

expressions  clearly  illustrate  the  consequences  of  second-order  correlation  effects  on  the 

reduced  density  matrices.  Application  is  made  to  a  simple  example:  the  (He)2  system. 

Reduced density matrices are explicitly calculated, correct to second order in correlation, and 

compared with approximations of independent electrons and independent electron pairs. The 

models  proposed  allow  for  variational  calculations  of  interaction  energies  and  equilibrium 

distance as well as a clear interpretation of dispersive effects on electron distributions. Both 

exchange and second order correlation effects are shown to play a critical role on the quality 

of the results.

I.  Introduction 

Van der Waals (VDW) forces are an important class of attractive intermolecular forces 

which involve polarization of  molecules. They notably include the noted London dispersion 

forces,  which  arise  from  temporarily  induced  dipoles  and  can  therefore  be  exhibited  by 

nonpolar  atoms  or  molecules.  Such  interactions  involve  correlation  of  distant  electrons. 

Dispersion interactions can accordingly not be accounted for at Hartree-Fock (HF) level. 

Moreover,  in  the  context  of  density  functional  theory  (DFT),  it  has  often  been 

outlined1,2  that  usual  (approximate)  exchange-correlation  functionals  can  neither  reproduce 

realistic  interaction  energies  nor  lead  to  satisfactory  equilibrium  distances.  For  example, 

semilocal generalized gradient approximations may fail to predict any attraction between two 

spherically symmetric non-overlapping electron densities3,4 while local density approximation 

(LDA)  is  rather  overbinding.5  In  facts,  the  use  of  exchange-correlation  functionals  merely 

results in underestimated equilibrium distances and overestimated interaction energies.1,2,3 In 

particular,  it  has  been  shown  that  the  choice  of  the  exchange  functional  is  critical1  for  an 

accurate description of VDW systems, especially in the “bond” region. Therefore, modeling 

dispersion  effects  requires  a  careful  analysis.  To  this  aim,  various  approaches  have  been 

proposed,  see  for  instance  Refs.  1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11  and,  in  particular  Refs.  10,11  for  a 

discussion thereof. 

Beyond the computation of interaction energies and intermolecular potentials, an issue 

of this paper is the modeling of electron distributions. In particular, questions that raise are: 

how  (much)  are  electron  densities  impacted  by  dispersion  effects?  Can  we  possibly  "see" 

dispersion effects through x-Ray experiments? In this respect, we adopt here a density-matrix 

description  of  electron  correlation,  as  density  matrices  provide  a  natural  basis  for  passing 

from direct to momentum space and vice versa.12,13,14 Furthermore, electron correlation can be 

 

- 2 - 

2 

accounted  for  in  the  one-electron  matrix  and  subsequently  in  the  momentum  density,  in 

contrast with a DFT approach.15 

In  the  following,  closed-form  expressions  for  the  one-  and  two-electron  reduced 

density  matrices  for  a  general  N-electron  system  are  derived  from  a  pairwise  correlated 

wavefunction.  The  approach  chosen  extends  the  original  Colle-Salvetti’s  scheme  to  account 

for second-order correlation effects on both pair density and one-electron density-matrix (sect. 

II).  In  the  case  of  dispersive  correlation,  simple  correlation  functions  may  be  inferred  from 

perturbation theory. Closed form expressions are then derived for electron distributions (sect. 

III). In the last section and as a check, use is made of said expressions for the computation of 

electronic  properties  of  the  (He)2  system.  Equilibrium  distance  and  interaction  energy  are 

computed.  The  model  density-matrices  are  compared  to  other  approaches,  including 

independent electron- and independent pair approximations.

The  approach  of  Colle-Salvetti20  (hereafter  CS)  makes  Eq.  (8)  the  starting  point  for  the 

derivation of a correlation energy expression. This expression bypasses N-electron effects (the 

neglected R term) on the pair density beyond those involving one pair at a time. As such, this 

approach  has  some  connection  with  an  independent  pair  approximation  (IPA),  which  is 

known to be correct to first order only in correlation21. We note, however, that in spite of such 

physical  inconsistencies15,22,23  the  CS  scheme  is  particularly  simple  and  surprisingly 

accurate.24,25,26

As discussed in Ref. 26, the correlation function wij is empirically parameterized in the 

CS  scheme.  Accordingly,  calculation  of  the  correlation  energy  is  not  variational.  Note  that 

even if wij were variationaly optimized, it could manifestly not lead to correct energies, since 

(i)  the  model  2-RDM  of  Eq.  (8)  is  not  correctly  normalized  and  (ii)  the  model  assumes 

somehow  independent  pairs.  Further,  calculating  the  1-RDM  from  Eq.  (8),  using  Eq.  (3), 

results  in  discarding  most  of  the  correlation  effects  on  one-electron  densities  and  thus  the 

kinetic counterpart of correlation, which must at least partly balance the correlation-induced 

lessening of potential energy.26 This point shall be exemplified below.  

In  order  to  get  exact  closed-form  expressions  for  the  RDMs,  we  can  write  the  trial 

wavefunction as

Replacing now all excitation energies

second-order correlation effects survive in the 1-RDM, Eq. (20).

We now consider two similar closed-shell systems of two electrons each. Let the two 

functions a and b correspond to different locations, with a and b pointing at the corresponding 

centers and Rab be the (supposedly large) distance between the two centers. In a valence-bond 

approach, the two occupied orbitals are

The (He)2 energy is optimized with respect to variational parameters  D  and V, which 

are the average excitation energy and the 1s Slater orbital exponent, respectively. All results 

reported hereafter are in atomic units (a.u.).  

Corrective  terms  to  the  potential  energy  turn  out  to  be  less  than 

810 - .  The  main 

changes  in  energy  come  from  the  decrease  of  interelectronic  repulsion,  which  is  partly 

balanced by an increase of kinetic energy. The obtained interaction energy is shown in Fig. 1 

and further compared to those obtained within IE and IPA models. The minimization led to an 

interaction energy

.  The  Virial  ratio  at  equilibrium  position, 

e.g. 

-

V (cid:6)

T

, is 2 [+3 10-10], indicating a satisfactory compensation of potential energy by 

the kinetic term. Results obtained for various distances are reported in table 1. Interestingly, 

the optimal value of D remains almost constant for the whole range of internuclear distances 

of table 1: the average value found is - 2.98828 with a standard deviation of 5 10-5.  

Note that minimizing the energy while imposing 

= VV
0

1
(cid:2)=

6875

 yields values quasi-

identical  to  the  relaxed  case  as  regards  ED , 

eqR   and  D .  However,  the  quantity 

-

V (cid:6)

T

 

obtained  in  this  case  is  1.999991,  denoting  a  slightly  overestimated  kinetic  energy.  Thus,  a 

direct  formulation  of  correlated  density-matrices  from  uncorrelated  ones  (without  relaxing 

subsystem  electron  densities)  through  correlation  factors  is  questionable,  given  the 

consequences on the individual components of the total energy. 

The  IPA  results  have  been  obtained  using  RDMs  defined  in  (25)  and  (26).  IPA 

parameters  were  optimized  following  the  same  procedure  as  before  (see  table  1).  Again, 

optimized  Ds  can  be  considered  as  constant  for  the  whole  range  of  internuclear  distances 

considered (4 to 15 a.u.), though the value obtained is in this case D » -1.11. The IPA gives 

 

- 13 -

rise to a much shorter equilibrium distance (4.99) than the former, together with a well-depth 

of

-

, which is more than five times the depth found from the dispersive model of 

Eqs. (23), (24) and almost three times the estimated full configuration interaction value of van 

Mourik  and  Dunning  31.  The  quantity 

-

V (cid:6)

T

  at  equilibrium  is  now  2  [+2.5  10-6].  These 

results show that IPA overestimates attractive terms and/or underestimates the kinetic energy.  

Interestingly,  the  IPA  interaction  energy  can  however  closely  reproduce  the  results 

obtained  from  the  correlated  model  of  Eqs.  (23)  and  (24)  through  an  appropriate 

parameterization (with D = - 5.26, see figure 1). 

 Besides, accurate calculations31,32 have shown that the equilibrium distance should be 

close  to  5.60,  with  a  corresponding  cohesive  energy  of  3.48  10-5.  In  comparison,  an  MP2 

calculation  within  aug-ccpV5Z  basis  set  results  in  5.82  and  2.07  10-5,  respectively.  This 

comparison shows that although dispersion forces are underestimated in our model, they lead 

to  a  quite  accurate  equilibrium  distance  (5.68),  together  with  a  reasonable  cohesive  energy

  in  the  SAPT  decomposition  of  the 

(He)2  interaction  energy.33  We  note  that  our  result  probably  benefits  from  compensation 

occurring  in  the  exact  energy  components.  Concerning  the  equilibrium  distance,  the 

satisfactory  agreement  obtained  can  further  be  understood  as  repulsive  energy  varies  much 

faster  than  the  attraction  energy  near  the  equilibrium  distance  (typically 

12-

abR   vs. 

6-
abR ), 

making  the  equilibrium  distance  quite  independent  from  the  attractive  term.  Thus,  one 

understands  how  important  it  is  to  accurately  describe  exchange,  given  its  consequences  on 

the repulsive energy.  

Now, in most LDA approaches, exchange is not accurately described in the midpoint 

region. As to illustrate this, we may substitute the IE exchange energy component contributed

,  using  various  values  for  C,  namely  C  =  0.7937  or  0.7386,  see  pp.  121  – 

123 of [34. Minimizing the energy with respect to parameters  D  and V, the cohesive energies 

obtained  are  –1.2  10-3  and  -3.7  10-3  and  the  equilibrium  distances  are  4.91  and  5.12, 

respectively.  Such  values  are  in  line  with  those  actually  obtained  from  conventional  DFT 

approaches (see for example the results listed in table 1 of Ref. 1]) but are in poor agreement 

with the values obtained using the exact IE exchange energy.  

We  may  assume  exchange  effects  to  be  reasonably  accounted  for  in  the  dispersive 

model of Eqs. (20), (21). In this respect, the IPA approximation of Eqs. (25) and (26) benefits 

from  the  same  determinantal  exchange  functional.  Since  IPA  widely  overestimates  the 

interaction  energy  and  underestimates  the  equilibrium  distance,  it  is  to  be  concluded  that 

dispersive correlation effects must also be carefully implemented.  

V.  Conclusions 

A pairwise correlated wavefunction was used for deriving exact closed-expressions for 

the correlated density matrices. A dispersive model for the density matrices has further been 

proposed, correct to second order in the correlation function w. Such expressions illustrate N-

electron  effects  (yet  induced  by  a  pairwise  wavefunction)  on  the  reduced  densities. 

Application to the (He)2 dimer leads to a fair cohesive energy and a quite accurate equilibrium 

distance. Furthermore, we put emphasis on the shortcomings arising from an independent pair 

approximation  (which  is  somehow  similar  to  the  Colle-Salvetti  approach):  correlation 

corrections to the 1-electron densities are markedly underestimated, as reported elsewhere.26 

The  independent  pair  approximation  was  accordingly  found  to  overestimate  (dispersive) 

correlation  and,  in  turn,  underestimate  the  equilibrium  distance  of  (He)2  when  variationaly 

optimizing  the  energy.  However,  an  appropriate  parameterization  of  the  independent  pair 

 

- 15 - 

15 

approximation model enables to closely reproduce the cohesive energy obtained from the first 

dispersive model. Similarly, we can infer that an empirical parameterization of the correlation 

functional may artificially include N-electron (N > 2) effects as well as the neglected kinetic 

energy of correlation. Interestingly, such a result may partly explain the accuracy of the Colle-

Salvetti’s  model.  All  the  more,  such  a  correlation  functional  may  possibly  remain  accurate 

even  far  from  the  equilibrium  geometry,  as  in  the  present  case.  Calculations  could  thus  be 

tested  for  large  Van  der  Waals  systems,  using  an  approximate  correlation  functional, 

conveniently parameterized. 

Finally, we have evaluated the impact of dispersive effects, using Eq. (20), for both the 

(He)2  and  the  (CH4)2  system.  Dispersion  effects  result  in  additional  lobes  in  the  charge 

density, along the molecular axis, while slightly shifting the momentum density n(p) towards 

higher  momenta,  consistently  with  the  virial  theorem.  The  maximum  relative  deviations  for 

electron densities of (He)2 were found to be

. These small 

deformations can be explained by the weak polarizabilities of Helium atoms. More generally, 

closed-shell  systems  are  weakly  polarizable  so  that  dispersive  effects  should  not  lead  to 

significant corrections on 1-electron densities. In addition, applying Eq. (27) to (CH4)2 results 

in  substantially  larger  maximal  relative  deformations.  The  average  excitation  energy  was 

approximated  using  either  the  ionization  energy  or  the  smallest  allowed  excitation  energy. 

However, the absolute deformation magnitude in position space remains similar to the (He)2 

case, i.e. less than 1.0 10-4 Bohr-3 or 1.0 10-3 Å-3. Such magnitudes remain substantially below 

the current resolution of X-ray experiments (» 0.05 Å-3). All the more, such deformations are 

very small compared with deformations due to intra-atomic correlation, which may contribute 

up  to  a  few  percent  to  1-electron  densities.12,14,35  Accordingly,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  sole 

dispersive effects be observable through x-ray diffraction or Compton scattering experiments.

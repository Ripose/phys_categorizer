          A quantum variant of a classical inequality obtained by Uffink and 
van Lith, is derived by elementary means and examined for the breadth of 
its applications. The inequality applies to 'all' operators and 'all' pairs of 
quantum states. It is shown to imply all the Robertson generalized 
uncertainty relations, to generalize the orthogonality of eigenvectors for 
distinct eigenvalues, and to severely constrain the difference of both 
probabilities and the response to unitary transformation from pairs of                      
'close' quantum states. Thus, it is dubbed a master inequality. The                        
suggestion is made that only the surface has been scratched here.

1. Introduction   
 
  This note is an advertisement, primarily for an inequality and secondarily 
for the method of derivation. It provides an elementary derivation of and 
suggests useful employment for a simple but powerful inequality which the 
author has not quite seen before and which inquiries have suggested is not 
well known. Uffink and van Lith (1999) obtained a very similar but slightly 
weaker result in classical probability theory which they applied to the 
derivation of Thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Accordingly, neither the 
inequality presented here nor the methods employed to obtain it are peculiar 
to quantum theory. Rather, essentially identical versions of both apply 
throughout probability theory as will become clear in § 5. In particular, some 
of the ideas involved here are related to the discussions of physical 
applications of statistical estimation theory by Uffink and collaborators, as 
subsequent references will indicate. While there are circumstances in which 
the inequality derived here can be said to be roughly 40% stronger than the 
quantum version of the Uffink-van Lith inequality, there are broad 
circumstances in which the two inequalities are nearly equivalent. Indeed 
most of the consequences obtained here from the present inequality could 
also be obtained from the quantum version of the Uffink-van Lith inequality. 
Perhaps the biggest difference concerning the two inequalities, themselves, 
is that the derivation given here is noticeably simpler and more elementary 
than that of Uffink and van Lith. 
 
  The special interest of the inequality in the quantum context springs from a 
quantum state being a repository of a vast array of probability distributions. I 
call the inequality a master inequality because of the great variety of 
consequences that follow from it, in particular other inequalities over which 
it supervenes. Most of the consequences displayed here are, themselves, well 
known and are rederived here to display that variety and to establish the 
logical status of the master inequality. But some of the consequences (see 
the last half of § 3 and § 6 ) I have not seen before. 
   
   For any two quantum states of a system and any operator defined on the 
two states, the inequality asserts a uniform upper bound for the ratio of the 
absolute difference of the expectation values to the sum of the rms 
deviations of the operator in the two states. For the special case of pure 
states, Ψand Ψ',  represented by unit norm vectors, |
respectively, and a

    The fact that the same upper bound, tan θ, holds for any self adjoint 
operator will be used (see § 3) to give a precise and strong form to the not 
surprising notion that if  tan θ  is small, it will be difficult to distinguish 
between the two states by performing measurements on systems in those 
states (Hilgevoord and Uffink, 1990, 1991). This, coupled with the form of 
the bounded ratio, makes the inequality reminiscent of the Rayleigh criterion 
for distinguishing between optical images of nearby point sources by 
comparing the separation of their diffraction peaks with the widths of the 
diffraction circles. But uses of (1.2) will also be indicated for the case in 
which  tan θ  is not small. 
 
    Among the applications of the inequality derived here, we will find        
(see § 3) a useful generalization of the rule that eigenvectors corresponding 
to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal and it will be shown (see § 4) that all 
of the  Robertson (1929) generalized uncertainty relations, 
 
                             
 
emerge as special cases of the inequality. 
  
  The generalization to non-self adjoint operators and mixed quantum states 
is presented in § 5 and the example of unitary operators is considered in § 6.

    Returning to (1.2) consider the case in which  
operator, i.e., 
 

 , a projection

  The importance of this case lies in the fact that any probability that can be 
obtained from a quantum state is expressible as the expectation value of 
some projection operator. Therefore, for  ψ  and  ψ ' there is no probability 
that differs between them by more than (3.7a) allows  . 
 
  Furthermore, for any projection operator, the rms deviation is,

 an explicit function of the expectation value. This function always lies 
between  0  and  1/2  and approaches zero for both the zero and unit limit of 
the expectation value. These features of the rms deviation make (3.7a) a 
rather powerful inequality. 
 
   To see this, recall that regardless of how large  tan θ  might be, so long as 
it is finite, the absolute difference of expectation values can not equal unity. 
For the difference to equal unity, the two expectation values would have to 
be zero and unity, in which case they would be eigenvalues and the two 
states, eigenstates corresponding to distinct eigenvalues, i.e., the states 
would be orthogonal and tan θ, infinite. Now the inequality, (3.7a), enforces 
this result due to (3.7b), i.e.,  for any finite  tan θ  , it places limits below 
unity on the absolute difference of expectation values. In fact, a variational 
analysis of (3.7a,b), which we provide in Appendix 1, yields the useful, but 
weaker inequality, 
 
                               |
 
>Π<−>Π<
'
 
 To exemplify the weakness of (3.8a), relative to (3.7a,b), we mention that 
the latter also directly implies that if one of the expectation values is zero or 
unity, then, 
 
                             |
 
>Π<−>Π<
'
 
  These last two inequalities are especially provocative at the other extreme 
of small values of  θ. Here they provide a precise sense in which it would be 
difficult to distinguish statistically between  ψ  and  ψ '. The smaller the 
value of θ, the finer the statistical data would have to be to make the 
distinction between the probabilities represented by the expectation values of 
the projection operator. An illuminating discussion of this kind of problem 
in the context of general probability theory is provided by Hilgevoord and 
Uffink, (1991). An earlier discussion by the same authors focused on 
quantum mechanics is (Hilgevoord and Uffink, 1990).

  Taking our next departure from an aspect of the discussion of these authors, 
we consider the case in which the state vectors 
members of a family, differentiably parameterized by the continuous

  As is nicely spelled out by Uffink (1993), relations of this type for  
 b = time  and  B = energy and,  
 
                                       
with 
 
                           
 
were originally obtained by Mandelstam and Tamm, (1945), and then 
rederived by several workers, (Fleming, 1973), (Bhattacharya, 1983), (Home 
and Whitaker, 1986), (Vaidman, 1992). The case of arbitrary 'canonical' 
pairs, (b, B), is presented, amidst other generalizations, in (Fleming, 1981). 
The interest here lies in the emergence of (3.13-17) from  special cases of 
the inequality (3.7a) or (1.2).                  
 
  Returning to (3.5) we apply (3.16, 17), with 
replaced by  d , to find that,

As a precursor to the next section we note that the pair, (3.5, 18), or the pair, 
(3.6, 19), yield Heisenberg’s uncertainty relation. 
 
 
4. The Robertson generalized uncertainty relations 
 
   To obtain, from the inequality (1.2), the Robertson generalized uncertainty 
relations (1.3) (Robertson, 1929), we simply choose,

and                     
 
Combining these in (1.2) we obtain,

  But can the partial isometry be so extended to a unitary operator? The 
q ' ˆˆ
answer is yes iff the null spaces of   q  and   q  are equi-dimensional. This 
is trivially the case if the whole state space is finite dimensional since the 
dimension of the null spaces is just that finite dimension minus the equi-
dimensionality of the orthogonal complements of the null spaces. For an 
infinite dimensional state space the null spaces are again trivially equi-

This novel result is the version for expectation values of unitary operators 
corresponding to  the result (3.13) for projection operators. Note that the 
difference of a factor of 2 between (6.9) and (3.13) correlates with the 
difference of 2 in the exponent in the definitions, (6.3) and (3.11), of  cos α 
and,  cos φ(b)  respectively. The inequality, (6.9), generalizes easily to the 
case of mixed states.      
 
   In special cases one would expect to be able to obtain stronger results than 
(6.8). Indeed, Uffink and Hilgevoord (1985), in the context of distinguishing 
between the uncertainty principle and the uncertainty relations, have 
examined a comparison of the expectation values of a unitary operator in 
two pure states related by a projection operator, i.e.,

They derive an inequality (not their final result) which, in our notation and 
modulo our earlier comment about the distinction in the angle  θ  for pure 
states and mixed states, is  
 
                                         
 
This is stronger than (6.8) for the range,  π/2  >  α  >  max( 2θ, π/3 ), in 
which they use it. 
 
  Finally, one can sometimes obtain, from (5.16), a limit on the difference of

  Furthermore, suppose  ρ is an eigenstate of the unitary transformation, e.g.

 implements a rotation about the z axis while ρ is an eigenstate of the z

7: Conclusion and acknowledgement 
 
   I have presented an elementary derivation of an apparently new, simple 
and powerful inequality in quantum theory. I have tried to illustrate the 
breadth and strength of the inequality by considering a variety of examples 
and applications of it, some of them yielding novel results. The logical status 
of the inequality within quantum mechanics seems to be quite high and it is 
obvious that only the surface of applications has been scratched in this 
paper. Further examination of this master inequality seems to be warranted. 
 
   I wish to thank Jos Uffink for very helpful communications during the 
preparation of this paper.

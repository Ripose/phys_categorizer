A diﬀerential geometric approach to singular perturbation theory is pre-

sented. It is shown that singular perturbation problems such as multiple-scale

and boundary layer problems can be treated more easily on a diﬀerential ge-

ometric basis. A general method is proposed based on diﬀerential forms and

Lie-derivatives. Examples from multiple scale theory, boundary layer theory

and WKB-theory are given and it is demonstrated that without the a priori

knowledge of the scaling behaviour of the problem the correct asymptotic ex-

pansion can be derived with the aid of diﬀerential forms. The method is well

suited for a mechanical implementation in computer algebra programs.

I. INTRODUCTION

The analysis of boundary layer problems and multiple scale phenomena which are gen-

eralized under the notion of singular perturbation problems has played a signiﬁcant role

in applied mathematics and theoretical physics [1,2]. Regular perturbation theory is often

not applicable to various problems due to resonance eﬀects or the cancellation of degrees of

freedom. In order to obtain a uniformly valid asymptotic expansion of a solution for these

singular problems a whole bunch of methods has been developed such as boundary layer

expansions, multiple scale methods, asymptotic matching, stretched coordinates, averaging

and WKB-expansions. Although these methods work well for the respective cases, a general

1

theory that uniﬁes all these methods is still lacking [4]. A general applicable method would

be highly desirable in order to obtain a mechanical scheme that can be easily implemented

in algorithmic programming languages.

A physical system often involves multiple temporal or spatial scales on which character-

istics of the system change. In some cases the long time behaviour of the system can depend

on slowly changing time scales which have to be identiﬁed in order to apply multiple scale

theory. The choice of the slowly or fast changing scales is a nontrivial task, which presumes

a good understanding of the physical behaviour of the system and can sometimes only be

justiﬁed by the ﬁnal result. A naive expansion in a power series of the small parameter is

often prevented by the appearance of resonant terms in higher orders. These terms have to

be compensated by the introduction of counterterms.

Boundary layers are also a common feature of singular perturbed systems.

In these

cases higher order derivatives disappear in the unperturbed equations which leads to the

cancellation of degrees of freedom of the system and ﬁnally in small regions where the system

changes rapidly. The identiﬁcation of the fast changing scales is crucial for the solution of

the perturbation problem and is a subtle task, sometimes involving delicate arguments.

In this Letter a geometrical approach is presented which allows a mechanical algorithm for

the determination of the rapid or slow scales on which the system changes. For that purpose

the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations is interpreted as a system of diﬀerential forms.

It is shown that a small perturbation of the system of diﬀerential forms can be viewed as a

deformation of the solution manifold in conﬁguration space. By searching for a Lie-derivative

that transforms the unperturbed diﬀerential forms into the perturbed forms a mapping in

conﬁguration space is deﬁned that can be used to map the solution of the unperturbed system

into the an approximate solution of the perturbed system in order to obtain uniformly valid

asymptotic expansions of the solution and thus determining the secular scales. The method

is exempliﬁed for common problems like multiple scale problems, boundary layer problems

and WKB-expansions.

Assume a system of ordinary diﬀerential equations in the n-dimensional conﬁguration

space Rn of the following form:

II. GENERAL THEORY

˙xi = Fi (x1, ..., xn)

where the dot denotes the derivative by the independent parameter t. The system is

solved by a n-dimensional curve C : xi (t) parametrized by t. It is easily to shown that all

ordinary diﬀerential equations can be written in this form [3,5]. The system of equations

can be written as a system of equations for diﬀerential forms:

ωij = Fi (x1, ..., xn) dxj − Fj (x1, ..., xn) dxi = 0

The diﬀerential forms ωij establish a basis for a subspace S of the space of all diﬀerential

forms in Rn. Every solution curve C then has the following property:

f (x) ω = 0

Z
C

for all elements ω of the subspace S and for all scalar functions f on Rn. This property

can be used as a very general deﬁnition of a solution manifold of a system of diﬀerential

forms and can be easily generalized to higher order diﬀerential forms and closed ideals of

Now we consider a perturbed subspace S′ of a subspace S0. Let ω(i)

can be written as:

(4)

for all elements ω = ω0 + εω1 of the subspace S′ and for all scalar functions f on Rn.

We assume that there exists a mapping Φ of Rn into Rn that maps the solution curve C0 of

the unperturbed system into the solution curve C = Φ (C0) of the perturbed system. If the

mapping fulﬁlls the condition:

with appropriate functions λ(i,j) (x) then one obtains:

By expanding the mapping in a power series with the small parameter ε one obtains

Φ∗ = 1 + ε L + O (ε2) where L is an appropriate Lie-derivative, one obtains in ﬁrst order:

1 + Lω(i)
ω(i)

This is a linear equation for the Lie-derivative L which we can try to solve. It deﬁnes Lie-

derivatives that map solutions of the unperturbed system S0 into solutions of the perturbed

system S′. This method can be applied also to singular perturbation problems where a

straightforward regular expansion is not available.

III. BOUNDARY LAYER ANALYSIS

The ﬁrst example of a singular problem that can be solved with the new method is given

by the following boundary layer problem [1]:

εy′′ + y′ + y = 0

(8)

with ε ≪ 1 and the boundary conditions y (0) = 0 and y′ (0) = 1 . The prime denotes

diﬀerentiation by x. This is a common boundary layer problem introducing a layer of

thickness ε. The layer thickness is usually obtained from a dominant balance argument.

The system is then rescaled to obtain a inner region equation which is afterwards matched

to the outer region solution. The choice of the thickness of the boundary layer is justiﬁed

in the end of the calculation by the existence of a uniform solution.

4

In the proposed method such a rescaling is not necessary.. The original equation is

written as a system of diﬀerential forms:

dy − z dx = 0

dy + y dx = −ε dz

The unperturbed diﬀerential forms are given by ω(1)

0 = dy − z dx, ω(2)

0 = dy + y dx and

1 = 0, ω(2)
ω(1)

1 = −dz are the perturbation, respectively. The unperturbed system can be

rewritten as dx = 0 and dy = 0 which has the solution x = x0 and y = y0. This zero-order

solution is clearly a singular solution.

In deviates strongly from the zero order solution

usually obtained from the equation y′ + y = 0. This diﬀerence is crucial in the present

approach.

After a tedious but straightforward calculation one obtains a Lie-derivative that maps

the unperturbed diﬀerential forms into the perturbation:

L = ln (y + z) ∂x + (z − y ln (y + z)) ∂y

One easily checks the transformation properties:

(1 + εL) (dy + y dx) = dy + y dx + ε dz + εfiω(0)

i

(1 + εL) (dy − z dx) = dy − z dx + εgiω(0)

i

where fi and gi are functions of x, y and z as deﬁned in equation (5). From the zero-order

solution x = x0 one obtains:

(1 + εL) (x − x0) = x − x0 + ε ln (y + z)

After the substitution z = y′ the solution can be written as:

x = x0 − ε ln (y + y′)

(9)

(10)

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

and thus by substituting and A = exp (x0/ε) one obtains the following ﬁrst-order diﬀer-

ential equation:

y′ + y = Ae−x/ε

(16)

The eﬀect of the mapping from the unperturbed system to the perturbed system is now

clearly demonstrated. In the limit ε → 0 the term with the second derivative in equation

(8) vanishes and the order of the equation changes which implicates a boundary layer which

becomes inﬁnitely thin for small ε. The transformed system (16) still possesses the additional

degree of freedom for small ε and one observes how the singularity forms when ε becomes

small. Equation (16) can be easily solved in order to obtain

and ﬁnally

y = Ae−x

ex(1−1/ε)dx + Be−x

Z

y = ¯Ae−x/ε + Be−x

which is the correct general uniform ﬁrst-order approximation. It should be emphasized

that the present approach gives the correct scaling behaviour in the boundary layer without

the need for a rescaling of the independent variable which is necessary in the usual asymptotic

matching procedure or in the renormalization group approach. Thus the presented method

is superior to the conventional methods in that it chooses selfconsistently the scaling of the

independent and dependent variables in order to obtain a regular expansion.

IV. MULTIPLE SCALES

Another problem very common in mathematical physics is the appearance of multiple

scales on which the system changes. An example for this behaviour is given by the following

linear oscillator with a nonlinear damping term [1]:

(17)

(18)

(19)

y′′ + y + εy′3 = 0

6

The prime shall denote diﬀerentiation by the time variable t . The system possesses a

short time scale of the oscillation and a long time scale of the damping. The amplitude of

the oscillation slowly decays with time and a frequency shift might be observed.

The unperturbed system is just an ordinary linear oscillator with frequency unity. The

zero-order solution is given by y = R cos (t + θ) with arbitrary constants R and θ. In order

to simplify the calculations we introduce new dependent variables R and θ deﬁned by y =

R cos (t + θ) and y′ = −R sin (t + θ) . A basis for the perturbed subspace S′ is given by:

dR − εR3

(cid:18)

sin (4 (t + θ))

(cid:19)

The zero-order forms are just dR and dθ while the perturbations are given by the terms

with the front factor ε of equations (20) and (21). The system can further be simpliﬁed by

introducing the variable u = 1/R2 giving rise to the basis of the perturbed system:

A Lie-derivative that transforms the zero-order diﬀerential forms into the perturbing

diﬀerential forms can be obtained as:

L = −

V. WKB-EXPANSION

The last example we give is also a very standard problem in mathematical physics and

one of the building blocks of wave mechanics, the WKB-approximation of linear diﬀeren-

tial equations. The standard WKB-problem is given by the following ordinary diﬀerential

ε2y′′ + Ω2 (x) y = 0

The basis of diﬀerential forms of the unperturbed subspace S0 associated to this problem

and the perturbing forms are given by ω(1)

0 = dy − z dx, ω(2)

0 = Ω2 (x) y dx and ω(1)

1 = 0,

ω(2)
1 = dz. The basis can be rewritten in order to exhibit the exact nature of the zero-order

By introducing the new variables u = y2 and v = z2 a Lie-derivative that transforms the

zero-order basis into the perturbation can be found which reads as:

ω(1) = dx + ε2

ω(2) = d

and thus recovers the WKB-approximation for the initial problem:

VI. CONCLUSIONS

In this Letter we have shown that the diﬀerential geometric method is a superior tool in

order to obtain uniformly valid asymptotic expansions of singular perturbation problems. A

basic problem of singular perturbation theory is the appearance of diﬀerent scales on which

the dependent variables change. The identiﬁcation of these scales is a nontrivial process

which requires a deep understanding of the problem under consideration. The correct choice

of the scaling of the independent variables strongly inﬂuences the region of validity of the

asymptotic solution. The appearance of multiple scales can further complicate the task

of ﬁnding a uniformly valid approximation of the solution. The method presented in this

Letter facilitates this task and gives the correct expansions in a very natural way. We

have given three classical examples from singular perturbation theory and have shown how

easily uniformly valid approximations can be obtained with the new method. The method

is based on very general geometrical considerations and thus can be easily extended to more

complicated problems involving partial diﬀerential equations (work in progress).

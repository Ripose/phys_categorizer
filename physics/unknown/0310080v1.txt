An  interesting  phenomenon  observed  in  the  near-anode  region  of  a  Hall  thruster  is 

that  the  anode  fall  changes  from  positive  to  negative  upon  removal  of  the  dielectric 

coating, which is produced on the anode surface during the normal course of Hall thruster 

operation.  The  anode  fall  might  affect  the  thruster  lifetime  and  acceleration  efficiency. 

The  effect  of  the  anode  coating  on  the  anode  fall  is  studied  experimentally  using  both 

biased and emissive probes. Measurements of discharge current oscillations indicate that 

thruster operation is more stable with the coated anode.

In a gas discharge, there can be either an increase or a drop in the plasma potential 

toward the anode, generally referred to as the “anode fall”. When the anode is at a higher 

potential than the near-anode plasma, we call the anode fall “positive”, and when it is at a 

lower  potential  –  “negative”.  In  a  Hall  thruster  discharge  (HT),1  the  anode  fall  might 

affect the overall operation of the device. In the case of a positive fall, in which electrons 

gain  kinetic  energy  in  going  from  the  plasma  to  the  anode,  the  electron  energy  flux 

toward the anode is higher than in the case of a negative fall, when electrons are repelled. 

The increase in the power deposition near and at the anode might result in a decrease of 

the  thruster  acceleration  efficiency2,  an  increase  of  the  anode  heating  (which  may 

decrease the thruster lifetime), or additional ionization inside3 or near4 the anode.  

In spite of a number of experimental3-12 and theoretical13-15 studies of a HT internal 

plasma structure, the understanding of the intra-anodal and near-anode processes in HTs 

is  still  very  limited.  It  was  suggested  theoretically  that  steady-state  operation  of  a  HT 

requires  the  presence  of  a  negative  anode  fall.13  A  more  detailed  analysis  of  boundary 

conditions for a quasi-1D model of a HT proposed the possibility of HT operation in the 

absence  of  the  anode  fall,14  or  with  an  anode  fall  that  would  be  a  function  of  thruster 

operating conditions, namely the discharge voltage and the mass flow rate. The internal 

probe  measurements  reported  in  Refs.  6-11  were  mainly  focused  on  characterizing  the 

acceleration  region  in  HT  and,  therefore,  do  not  provide  information  on  the  anode  fall 

behavior. However, they indicate thruster operation under conditions of a nearly zero6-10 

or a positive11 anode fall. Also noteworthy is that the penetration of near-anode electrons 

into the anode cavity causes ionization of the working gas inside the anode [3].

In this letter, we report the results of non-disturbing measurements in the near-anode 

region  of  the  123  mm  diameter  laboratory  Hall  thruster16  operating  in  the  0.2-2  kW 

power  range.  The  plasma  potential,  plasma  density  and  electron  temperature  are 

measured at a few millimeters from the anode with movable biased electrostatic probes of 

planar  geometry  and  movable  emissive  probes.  The  anode  sheath  thickness,  typically 

assumed  to  be  several  Debye  lengths, 

mm05.0~Dλ

,  is  thus  very  small,  which  makes 

technically difficult the use of probe diagnostics inside the sheath. However, information 

about the sign and magnitude of the anode fall can be obtained through probing plasma in 

the presheath, at a few millimeters from the anode.  

The  laboratory  thruster,  the  test  facility  and  the  slow-movable  radial  probes  setup 

used in this study are described in Refs 16 and 17. The thruster was operated at xenon gas 

mass  flow  rates  of 

52m
−=&

s/mg

,  and 

in 

the  discharge  voltage  range  of 

Vd

=

−

V450

.  The  magnetic  field  was  kept  constant  (B

max  ≈  120  Gauss  along  the 

channel median16). After the first set of experiments, with the biased probe, the dielectric 

coating,  which  appears  on  the  anode  surface  in  the  course  of  thruster  operation,  was 

removed, and a second set of experiments, with the biased probe, was conducted. In the 

third set of experiments, after the anode was coated again, measurements of the plasma 

potential with a floating emissive probe and discharge current oscillations measurements 

were  performed.  After  that,  the  anode  was  cleaned  again  and  emissive  probe 

measurements were repeated, along with current oscillation measurements. Experimental 

procedures  (including  data  analysis)  for  biased  and  emissive  probe  measurements  are 

described in Ref. 17. Oscillations of the discharge current in the 10-100 kHz wave band 

were measured using a low-inductance low-capacitance 1  Ω  shunt, placed in the cathode

circuit,  and  LeCroy  LT264M  digital  oscilloscope  connected  through  two  10:1  passive 

probes. 

Fig. 1 shows

 characteristics of the 123 mm Hall thruster with the clean 

and coated anodes (referred to as “Clean” and “Coat”, respectively) for several mass flow 

rates.  As  can  be  seen,  the  characteristics  are  similar  for  two  anodes.  Fig.  2  shows  the 

results of biased probe measurements in the near-anode region of the HT with the clean 

and  coated  anodes,  for 

5m&
=

s/mg

.  Zero  potential  is  chosen  at  the  anode.  As  can  be 

seen from Fig. 2 (a), the plasma potential at 2 – 12 mm from the anode is higher than the 

anode potential in the case of the clean anode, and lower than the anode potential in the 

case of the coated anode. This indicates the presence of a negative, electron repelling, and 

a positive, electron attracting, anode fall, respectively.  

The  thruster  anode  serves  also  as  a  gas  distributor.  When  the  outer  surface  of  the 

anode  is  coated  with  dielectric,  the  discharge  current  circuit  supposedly  closes  at  the 

inner side of the anode, where the plasma penetrates through the gas-injecting holes3. The 

combined  cross-sectional  area  of  the  holes  is  significantly  smaller  than  the  conductive 

surface area of the clean anode. To achieve a discharge current similar to that of the clean 

anode, the coated anode necessitates additional ionization near and inside the anode. This 

could  be  the  reason  for  the  formation  of  a  positive  fall  near  the  coated  anode,  with  the 

magnitude  of  one  to  three  times  the  electron  temperature,  Te.  Two  experimental  facts 

support this logic. Firstly, the formation of the anode coating in the thruster is associated 

with  a  visual  effect:  the  gas-injecting  holes  start  to  glow  brighter  than  the  rest  of  the 

anode, with appearance of a jet-like structure from each hole. Secondly, in the N vs. Vd 

characteristics presented in Fig. 1 (b), the density near the coated anode is almost twice as 

 

4

large as it is near the clean anode. Since ions in the positive anode fall are moving from 

the  anode  into  the  near-anode  region,  the  high  density  might  indicate  enhanced 

ionization,  which  takes  place  near  and  inside  the  coated  anode.  The  fact  that  the  anode 

fall  changes  from  negative  to  positive  when  the  anode  surface  area  is  decreased  is  also 

well known for glow discharges.18  

Fig. 2 (a) shows that the magnitude of the anode fall increases with the increase of 

the  discharge  voltage  for  the  clean  anode,  and  decreases  for  the  coated  anode.  This 

correlates with the fact that the near-anode electron temperature increases with 

dV

 [Fig. 

2 (b)]. At the same 

, the increase of the near-anode 

 can increase the negative anode 

eT

dI

fall  and  reduce  the  positive  one,  in  three  ways:  a)  by  increasing  ionization;  b)  by 

increasing  the  electron  velocity  toward  the  anode;  and  c)  by  increasing  the  electron 

bombardment  of  the  anode,  which,  in  the  case  of  the  coated  anode,  could  lead  to  the 

partial  removal  of  the  dielectric  coating  and  to  the  increase  of  the  anode  collecting 

surface area, AA. As can be seen from Fig. 2 (c), the positive fall near the coated anode 

decreases  with  the  increase  of  the  mass  flow  rate,  at  the  same 

.  Ionization  becomes 

dV

more effective at larger 

m& , while the discharge current in Hall thrusters is limited by a 

magnetic  field  profile,  which  could  result  in  the  described  behavior  of  the  anode  fall. 

However,  the  increase  of  AA  due  to  the  electron  bombardment,  which  becomes  more 

effective at larger  m& , could also account for that fact. 

The  results  of  emissive  probe  measurements,  presented  in  Fig.  3,  corroborate  the 

results of the biased probe measurements described above. It can be seen that the anode 

fall is, again, positive for the coated anode, and negative for the clean one. Also, the near-

anode plasma potential generally increases with the increase of 

dV

 and 

m& . However, the 

 

5

tendencies  are  more  complicated  than  those  that  follow  from  the  biased  probe 

measurements.  This  could  be  due  to  the  poor  spatial  resolution  typical  for  floating 

emissive probes.19 Another reason could be that the thruster operating regimes were less 

stable in the experiments with the emissive probe.16 

Interestingly, for the same condition of the anode surface, it was impossible to select 

thruster operating conditions [

 dV , m& , 

)z(Br

] in a typical operating range of the 12.3 cm 

HT in order to alter the sign of the anode fall: it was always positive for the coated anode 

and negative for the clean anode. Although the measured near-anode potential structure is 

essentially two-dimensional,20 the above result holds for any radial location from near the 

inner  to  near  the  outer  channel  wall.  However,  as  can  be  seen  from  Fig.  2  (c),  at  very 

large mass flow rates the sheath near the coated anode alters and becomes negative. Also, 

in a separate set of measurements in the acceleration region of the same 123 mm diameter 

thruster with a coated anode,19  it was shown that at 

s/mg3m =&

 and 

Vd ≤

V300

, the 

plasma  potential  at  21  mm  from  the  anode  lies  below  the  anode  potential,  whereas  at 

Vd =

V600

  it  lies  several  volts  above.  Taking  into  account  that  axial  variations  of  the 

plasma potential in the near-anode region are relatively small [Fig. 2 (a)], the above must 

indicate altering of the anode sheath. The possible reason for this altering is, again, the 

increase of the near-anode electron temperature, which can reduce the positive anode fall 

in the three ways described above.  

Discharge current oscillations were observed in the tens of kilohertz wave band, as 

shown in Fig. 4. The results of oscillation measurements indicate that thruster operation 

is more stable with the coated anode. The physical mechanism of this phenomenon is not 

yet  understood.  The  typical  oscillation  frequencies  increase  with  the  discharge  voltage 

 

6

from  7-10  kHz  at 

Vd ≤

V200

  to  15-25  kHz  at

Vd ≥

V300

;  for 

5m =&

s/mg

  additional 

spectral maximum near 50 kHz appears at 

V300

. These oscillations may be critical 

Vd =

for the thruster power processing system design and thruster integration with the satellite 

onboard circuitry.21  

In  summary,  non-disturbing  measurements  in  the  near-anode  region  of  the  Hall 

thruster  with  biased  and  emissive  probes  showed  for  the  first  time  the  possibility  of 

thruster operation with both a negative and a positive anode fall. It appears that the sign 

of the anode fall is essentially a function of the anode collecting surface area, rather than 

the  thruster  operating  conditions.  It  was  observed  that  the  anode  fall  changes  from 

positive  to  negative,  at  the  same  thruster  operating  conditions,  when  the  dielectric 

coating, which appears on the anode surface in the course of operation, is removed.

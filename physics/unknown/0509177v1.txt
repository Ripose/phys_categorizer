     Global warming due to the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases has become a 

great  concern  and  has  been  linked  to  increased  hurricane  activity  (1-3)  associated  with 

higher  sea  surface  temperatures  (SSTs)  with  conflicting  views  (4).  Our  observational 

results based on long term trends of SST reveal that the anomaly reached a record 0.8 °C 

in the Gulf of Mexico in August 2005 as compared to previous years and may have been 

responsible for the intensification of the devastating Hurricane Katrina into a category 5 

hurricane  that  hit  the  Southern  coast  of  United  States  severely  impacting  the  low  lying 

city  of  New  Orleans  and  the  surrounding  areas.  In  most  intensifying  storms,  air-sea 

interaction is the major contributing factor (5) and here we show how air-sea interactions 

might have affected Katrina’s rapid intensification in the Gulf. 

     Air-sea  interactions  include  role  of  latent  heat  flux  (6),  sensible  heat  flux  and  SST 

towards the intensification and decay of hurricanes.  Generally, this requires the SST to 

be  at  least  26  °C  for  hurricanes  to  form,  be  maintained  and  intensify  (7).    Over  warm 

waters,  latent  heat  releases  moisten  the  lower  troposphere,  while  sensible  heat  fluxes 

warm  the  lower  troposphere.    Additionally,  within  the  hurricane,  there  is  a  release  of 

latent heat due to water  vapor cooling and condensing into cloud droplets.  This causes 

heat  energy  to  be  converted  from  potential  energy  to  kinetic  energy  thus  producing  a 

secondary  circulation  within  the  hurricane.  The  overall  effect  is  the  feedback  and 

intensification of the process.  

     Figure  1A  shows  that  the  mean  SST  values  were  above  ~30  °C  with  a  discernible 

warm  patch  of  ~33  °C  in  the  northwestern  shelf  adjacent  to  the  state  of  Louisiana  in 

August, 2005.  The SST anomaly (SSTA) reached a record value of ~0.8 °C as compared 

to previous years (Fig. 1B) with a positively increasing trend. The northwestern shelf in 

the  upper  Gulf  can  be  identified  as  a  localized  warm  area  that  might  have  provided 

additional  fuel  to  the  hurricane  as  it  entered  the  Gulf  from  the  western  side  crossing 

southern Florida.  Katrina was category 1 on August 25 and intensified to Category 2, 3, 

4  and  finally  5  after  entering  the  Gulf.    Furthermore,  daily  variations  of  surface  latent 

heat flux (SLHF) and sensible heat flux (SHF) values show significant increases during 

the intensification period of the hurricane with large peak values of ~500 Wm-2 and ~70 

Wm-2,  respectively  (Fig.  1C).    We  estimated  that  the  heat  contained  in  the  abnormally 

elevated  SST  values  of  the  Gulf  is  comparable  to  the  energy  in  latent  heat  in  the  inner 

hurricane, ~ 1014 J.   

These  results  suggest  that  the  anomalous  SST  was  the  prominent  factor  causing  the 

intensification  of  Katrina  in  the  Gulf,  although  other  associated  parameters  such  as 

vertical wind shear of ambient flow and atmospheric stability were also important.  The 

increasing trend of SSTA from 2001 combined with the increased hurricane activities in 

recent years suggest that the possibility of climate anomalies induced by global warming 

may  have  played  a  vital  role  in  the  intensification  of  Katrina.    Tracking  anomalously 

warm  Gulf  waters  is  important  since  if  this  trend  continues  in  the  years  ahead,  an 

increased number of hurricanes like Katrina will continue striking the Gulf areas.

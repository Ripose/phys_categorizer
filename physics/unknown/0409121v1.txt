Abstract 
We  present  a  way  of  teaching  Einstein’s  special  relativity.  It  starts  with  Galileo’s 
relativity, the learners know from previous lectures. The lecture underlines that we can 
have  three  transformation  equations  for  the  space-time  coordinates  of  the  same  event, 
which lead to absolute clock readings, time intervals and lengths (Galileo’s relativity), to 
absolute  clock  readings  but  to  relative  time  intervals  and  lengths  (up-to-date  Galileo 
transformations) and to relative clock readings time intervals and lengths.  
 
1.  First  level  of  understanding  physical  relativity:  absolute  clock  reading,  time 
intervals and lengths 
 
The student who starts learning Einstein’s special relativity knows physics at a Newton-
Galileo level, i.e. he is convinced that: 
 
A.  The  true  laws  of  physics  are  the  same  in  all  inertial  reference  frames  and  so  it  is 
impossible  to  distinguish  between  the  state  of  motion  and  the  state  of  rest  of  a 
laboratory by experiments we perform confined in it. 

B.  Relative motion does not desynchronize clocks once synchronized (brought to display 
the same time when they are instantly located at the same point in space) i.e. time and 
time intervals are absolute. 

C.  Measuring the length of the same rod observers in relative uniform motion obtain the 

same value i.e. lengths (space distances between two events) are absolute. 

D.  Distances  measured  perpendicular  to  the  direction  of  relative  motion  have  the  same 

magnitude for all inertial observers in relative motion. 

E.  The coordinates of the same event, when measured from two inertial reference frames 

in relative motion transform in accordance with the following equations

occurrence  that  could  take  place  at  a  given  point  in  space  at  a  given  time.  The 
coordinates  of  the  point  where  the  event  takes  place  represent  its  space  coordinates 
whereas its time coordinate equates the reading of the clock located where the event 
takes  place.  We  use  for  defining  an  event  the  notation 
  and

The art  of the instructor  who just  starts to teach special relativity is to convince the 
learners that statements B, C and E hold only in the case when the involved velocities 
are small when we compare them with the velocity at which light propagates through 
empty  space.  However,  he  underlines  that  physicists  hardly  believe  in  statement  A, 
which was not yet infirmed.

F. The  student  also  knows  that  in  all  the  experiments  performed  in  a  given  inertial 
laboratory (Michelson, Foucault) we measure the two way velocity of light 
. Doing 
that, we measure the time interval between the emission and the reception of a light 
signal that reflects itself on a mirror, located at a known distance from the source of 
light.  Galileo  describes  such  an  experiment  but  with  a  negative  result  because  the 
clocks he used where not able to measure very short time intervals.

G. There  is  no  experimental  evidence  for  the  fact  that  light  propagates  forward  at  the 
  representing  the 

fc   at  which  it  propagates  backward 

same  velocity 

fc   and 

, bc

one-way velocity of light. 

H. Inertial  observers  in  relative  motion,  equipped  each  with  a  co-moving  light  source 
obtain measuring the two-way velocity of light emitted by that source, the same value 
c

 as a direct consequence of statement A. 

 
2.  The  second  level  of  understanding  relativity:  Absolute  clock  readings,  relative 
time intervals and lengths 
 
At that new level of understanding relativity we consider that the propagation of light is 
isotropic  (
).  In  order  to  underline  the  important  part  played  by  clocks  (devices

same  point  in  space  are  equal  to  each  other,  a  hypothesis  with  which  we  started  the 
derivation  of  the  up-to-date  Galileo  transformations.  We  say  that  two  events  are 
simultaneous in a given reference frame when they take place there at the same time. As

We  have  now  all  the  elements  for  deriving  all  the  relativistic  effects,  encountered  in 
relativistic kinematics. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
As  a  moral  of  our  historical  survey  we  can  consider  that  some  times,  a  physicist  finds 
himself  in  a  similar  situation  to  that  of  a  tailor  who  has  to  fix  the  coat,  which  he  has 
tailored  (the  theory)  in  such  a  way  that  it  matches  the  client’s  body  (mother  nature). 
Commonly  speaking,  he  cuts  there  and  ads  elsewhere.  Rigorously,  he  looks  for  a 
tailoring  method  which  enables  him  to  consider  all  the  peculiarities  of  the  body  and 
which  may  ensure  the  success  from  the  first  “fitting”.  Good  experimental  results  and 
experimentally proved postulates ensure the success from the first fitting. 
Telling the learners that we have used in our derivations the “police radar” and the “radar 
detection procedure” we could make them more receptive.

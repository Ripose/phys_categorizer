ABSTRACT

Besides  two  fundamental  postulates,  (i)  the  principle  of  relativity  and  (ii)  the  constancy  of  the
one-way  speed  of  light  in  all  inertial  frames  of  reference,  the  special  theory  of  relativity  uses  the
assumption about the Euclidean structure of gravity-free space and the homogeneity of gravity-free time in
the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  Introducing  the  so-called  primed  inertial  coordinate  system,  in
addition  to  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  we  assume  the
Euclidean  structures  of  gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  and  their
generalized  Finslerian  structures  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  We  combine  this  assumption
with the two postulates (i) and (ii) to modify the special theory of relativity. The modified special relativity
theory involves two versions of the light speed, infinite speed c’ in the primed inertial coordinate system
and  finite  speed  c  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  It  also  involves  the  c’-type  Galilean
transformation  between  any  two  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  the  localized  Lorentz
transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  The  physical  principle  is:  the  c’-type
Galilean invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system  plus  the  transformation  from  the  primed  to
the  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  Evidently,  the  modified  special  relativity  theory  and  the  quantum
mechanics theory together found a convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

I. INTRODUCTION

that 

The  current  field  theory,  whether  classical  or  quantum,  has  been  suffering  from  the  divergence
difficulties for a long time. Indeed, the infinite self-energy of an electron in quantum electrodynamics was
known  as  early  as  1929  [1],  while 
in  classical  electrodynamics  was  known  earlier.
Phenomenologically substituting several finite experimental values (particle masses and charge) for their
infinities in theoretical calculations, people developed a kind of renomalization techniques to  remove  all
divergence in some quantized field systems. However, not all quantized field systems are renormalizable,
and  it  is  hard  to  accept  renormalizability  of  the  kind  as  a  basic  principle  to  truncate  those  non-
renormalizable  field  systems.  Moreover,  as  Feynman  said:  “renormalization  of  a  quantity  gives  up  any
possibility  of  calculating  that  quantity”  [1],  the  current  renormalized  quantum  field  theory  is  unable  to
explain the mass difference between neutron and proton. Such hardron mass differences are also in groups
of  the  p -mesons,  the  K-mesons,  the  S -baryons  and  the  X
-baryons.  The  origins  of  the  divergence
difficulties lay deep within the conceptual foundations of the theory. Two foundation stones of the current
quantum field theory are the special theory of relativity and the quantum mechanics theory. Since it is the
case that both  classical  field  theory  and  quantum  field  theory  are  plagued  by  the  divergence  difficulties,
the direction to get to the roots of these difficulties seems to be in the special theory of relativity. 

According  to  special  relativity,  energy  of  a  particle  in  a  many-particle  system  is  not  invariant.
According to special relativity, the transformation properties of  total  energy  in  the  many-particle  system
are quite indefinite because simultaneity at distant space points in a given inertial frame of reference is no
longer simultaneous in any different inertial frame of reference. These and other, such as the Lorentz non-
invariance of box volume, cause inextricable difficulties in constructing invariant statistical mechanics of
the  many-particle  system  and  its  invariant  thermodynamics  in  the  framework  of  the  special  theory  of
relativity [2].

Although  the  special  theory  of  relativity  has  been  enormously  successful  in  explaining  various
physical phenomena and has been tested to  very  high  degree  of  precision,  the  above  difficulties  indicate
that  it  is  not  a  ultimate  theory.  Just  for  this,  question  “Is  the  special  theory  of  relativity,  for  reasons
unspecified and unknown, only an approximate symmetry of nature?” was raised [3], and the neutrino and
Kaon  tests  to  investigate  possible  violations  of  the  Lorentz  invariance  were  proposed  [3,4].  A  kind  of
modification is needed for the special theory of relativity.

In  the  present  paper,  we  propose  a  modification  for  the  special  theory  of  relativity.  This
modification keeps the relativity principle and the constancy of the one-way speed of light but requires a
change in our notion about the local structures of gravity-free space and time. The paper consists of seven
sections. In Section II, we analyze  experimental  facts  for  indication  how  to  modify  the  special  theory  of
relativity.  With  the  experimental  indication,  we  make  a  study  of    special  relativity  in  Section  III.  The
special  theory  of  relativity  actually  uses  another  assumption  besides  two  fundamental  postulates  on  the
principle of relativity and the constancy of the one-way speed of light. But this another assumption is not
an experimentally well-grounded one. We are going to make a new assumption instead of it. Since Finsler
geometry and its generalization are not familiar to many people, we introduce them in Section IV before
we make the new assumption in Section V. In Section VI, we combine the new assumption with the two
fundamental postulates and modify the special theory of relativity. Finally, in Section VII, we draw some
conclusions  and  make  some  discussions,  especially,  about  the  physical  principle  in  the  modified  special
relativity theory. It is argued that the modified special relativity theory and the quantum mechanics theory
together found a convergent and invariant quantum field theory.

II. EXPERIMENTAL FACTS

Because of technological limitations, in the earlier experiments testing the constancy or isotropy
of the light speed, light was propagated in a closed path. The favorite conclusions from these experiments
are explicitly for the constancy of the speed of the round-trip propagating light, not for that of the one-way
speed  of  light.  As  a  result  of  the  technological  development,  many  experiments  have  been  done  in  the
manner  that  light  propagates  in  a  one-way.  Two  research  groups,  of  Turner  and  Hill  [5]  and  of
Champeney et al [6], placed a Co57 source near the rim of a standard centrifuge with an iron absorber near
the axis of rotation. They used the Mossbauer effect to look for any velocity dependence of the frequency
of the 14.4 KeV g -rays as seen by the Fe57 in the absorber. They established limits of D c/c<2x10-10 for the
anisotropy  in  the  one-way  speed  of  light.  Riis  and  his  colleagues  [7]  compared  the  frequency  of  a  two-
photon transition in a fast atomic beam to that of a stationary absorber while the direction of the fast beam
is rotated relative to the fixed stars and found the upper limit D c/c<3.5x10-9 firstly and D c/c<2x10-11 later
for the anisotropy.  The experiment of Krisher et al [8] was made by use of highly stable hydrogen-maser
frequency standards (clocks) separated by over 21 km and connected by a ultrastable fiber optics link. The
limits  yielded  from  the  experimental  data  are  respectively  D c/c<2x10-7  for  linear  dependency  and
D c/c<2x10-8 for quadratic dependency on the velocity of the Earth with respect to the cosmic microwave
background.

All experimental tests of the constancy of the one-way light speed can be also interpreted as the
tests of the local Lorentz invariance. Nevertheless, since local Lorentz non-invariance implies a departure
from  the  Einstein  time  dilation  and  singles  out  a  preferred  inertial  frame  of  reference,  the  experiments
done by McGowan et al [9], Bailey et al [10], Kaivola et al [11], Prestage et al [12], and Krisher et al [8]
can  be  accounted  immediate  testing  the  local  Lorentz  invariance.  Bailey  et  al,  Kaivola  et  al,  and
McGowan  et  al  verified  the  Einstein  time  dilation  to  an  accuracy  of  1x10-3,  4x10-5  and  2.3x10-6
respectively. The experiments of Prestage et al and Krisher et al are sensitive to the  effects  of  motion  of
their experimental apparatus relative to a preferred inertial frame of reference and sensitive to the form of
time  dilation  coefficient  of  the  used  hydrogen-maser  clocks.  However,  the  explicitly  null  results  were
provided in these two experiments for breakdown of the local Lorentz invariance.

Experiments  clearly  support  the  existence  of  the  constancy  of  the  one-way  light  speed,  the
Einstein velocity addition law and the local Lorentz invariance [5-13]. The experimental indication is: any
modification  of  special  relativity  must  keep  the  constancy  of  the  one-way  speed  of  light  and  the  local
Lorentz invariance.

III. THE SPECIAL RELATIVITY THEORY

Einstein  published  his  special  theory  of  relativity  in  1905  [14].  He  derived  the  Lorentz
transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  which  is  the  kinematical  background
for the physical principle of the Lorentz invariance. Two fundamental postulates stated by Einstein as the
basis for his theory are (i) the principle of relativity and (ii) the constancy of the one-way speed of light in
all inertial frames of reference. Besides these two fundamental postulates, the special  theory  of  relativity
also  uses  another  assumption.  This  other  assumption  concerns  the  Euclidean  structure  of  gravity-free
space  and  the  homogeneity  of  gravity-free  time  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3,
x1=x, x2=y, x3=z,

rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,
everywhere and every time.
 
Postulates  (i)  and  (ii)  and  the  assumption  Eqs.(1)  together  yield  the  Lorentz  transformation
between any two usual inertial coordinate systems [14-18]. Indeed, though the assumption Eqs.(1) was not
explicitly  articulated,  evidently  having  been  considered  self-evident,  Einstein  said  in  1907:  “Since  the
propagation velocity of light in empty space is c with respect to both reference systems, the two equations,
2=0,  must  be  equivalent.”  [17].  Leaving  aside  a  discussion  of
x1
whether  postulate  (i)  implies  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  velocities  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  we
know  that  the  two  equivalent  equations,  the  linearity  of  transformation  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative
velocities lead to the Lorentz transformation.

Some  physicists  explicitly  articulated  the  assumption  Eqs.(1)  in  their  works  on  the  topic.  Pauli
wrote:  “This  also  implies  the  validity  of  Euclidean  geometry  and  the  homogeneous  nature  of  space  and
time.”  [16],  Fock  said:  “The  logical  foundation  of  these  methods  is,  in  principle,  the  hypothesis  that
Euclidean geometry is applicable to real physical space together with further assumptions, viz. that rigid
bodies exist and that light travels in straight lines.” [18].

Minkowski  [19]  showed  in  1909  that  the  Lorentz  transformation  is  just  a  rotation  in  four-dimensional
spacetime. He also showed how to use the four-dimensional tensor analysis for writing invariant physical
laws under the Lorentz transformation. The Minkowskian structure Eq.(2) is  a  four-dimensional  version
of the assumption Eqs.(1).

IV. GENERALIZED FINSLER GEOMETRY

Finsler geometry is a kind of generalization of Riemann geometry [20-21]. It was first suggested
by  Riemann  as  early  as  1854,  and  studied  systematically  by  Finsler  in  1918.  Its  most  significant  work,
from the viewpoint of differential geometry, has been completed by Cartan, Rund and others.

In  Finsler  geometry,  distance  ds  between  two  neighboring  points  xk  and  xk+dxk,  k=1,2,---,n  is

defined by a scale function

ds=F(x1,x2,---,xn,dx1,dx2,---dxn)

or simply

ds=F(xk,dxk),  k=1,2,---,n,

which depends on directional variables dxk as well as coordinate variables xk. Apart from several routine
conditions  like  smoothness,  the  main  constraint  imposed  on  this  scale  function  is  that  it  is  positively
homogeneous of degree one in dxk,

F(xk,l dxk)=l F(xk,dxk)  for l >0.

Introducing a set of equations
gij(xk,dxk)= ¶

 2F2(xk,dxk)/2 ¶ dxi ¶ dxj,  i,j=1,2,---,n,

we can represent Finsler geometry in terms of

ds2=gij(xk,dxk)dxidxj, 

(2)

(4)

(5)

(6)

a
where  gij(xk,dxk)  is  called  the  Finslerian  metric  tensor  induced  from  scale  function  F(xk,dxk).  The
Finslerian metric tensor is symmetric in its subscripts and all its components are positively homogeneous
of degree zero in dxk,

gij(xk,dxk)=gji(xk,dxk),
gij(xk,l dxk)=gij(xk,dxk)  for l >0.
We can define the so-called generalized Finsler geometry by omitting Eq.(3) as a definition of ds
and instead taking Eq.(6) as a definition of ds2, where the given metric tensor gij(xk,dxk) satisfies Eqs.(7)
and other routine conditions.

(7a)
(7b)

The generalized Finsler geometry is so-named because a Finsler geometry must be a generalized
Finsler geometry but the inverse statement is not valid, in other words, a generalized Finsler geometry is
not necessarily a Finsler geometry [21].

A generalized Finsler geometry with a given metric tensor  gij(xk,dxk)  is  also  a  Finsler  geometry
when and only when we can find a scale function F(xk,dxk) by solving the set of equations, Eqs.(5), such
that this function, as a solution to the set of equations Eqs.(5), is positively homogeneous of degree one in
dxk. In the case, F2(xk,dxk) is positively homogeneous of degree two  in  dxk.  The  following  equation  thus
holds due to Euler’s theorem on homogeneous functions,
2F2(xk,dxk)= dxi [ ¶ F2(xk,dxk)/ ¶ dxi].

(8)

Iterating Eq.(8), we find
4F2(xk,dxk)= dxj d

ij[ ¶ F2(xk,dxk)/ ¶ dxi]
+dxj dxi[ ¶ 2F2(xk,dxk)/  ¶ dxj ¶ dxi].

It then follows from use of Eq.(8) that

F2(xk,dxk)= dxj dxi[ ¶ 2F2(xk,dxk)/ 2 ¶ dxj ¶ dxi].
Eq.(10) combines with Eqs.(5) and (6) to yield Eq.(3).

(10)

Like Finsler geometry, generalized Finsler geometry can be endowed with the Cartan connection.

V. A NEW ASSUMPTION ON LOCAL STRUCTURES OF SPACE AND TIME

Conceptually, the principle of relativity implies that there exists a class of the equivalent inertial
frames  of  reference,  any  one  of  which  moves  with  a  non-zero  constant  velocity  relative  to  any  other.
Einstein  wrote:  “in  a  given  inertial  frame  of  reference  the  coordinates  mean  the  results  of  certain
measurements  with  rigid  (motionless)  rods,  a  clock  at  rest  relative  to  the  inertial  frame  of  reference
defines a local time, and the local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized clocks and taken
together, give the time of this inertial frame of reference.”[15]. As defined by Einstein, each of the inertial
frames  of  reference  is  supplied  with  motionless,  rigid  unit  rods  of  equal  length  and  motionless,
synchronized  clocks  of  equal  running  rate.  Then,  in  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  an  observer  can
employ his own  motionless-rigid rods and motionless-synchronized  clocks  in  the  so-called  “motionless-
rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method to measure space and time intervals.
By  using  this  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method,  the
observer in each inertial frame of reference can set up his own usual inertial coordinate system. Postulate
(ii)  means  that  the  speed  of  light  is  measured  to  be  the  same  constant  c  in  every  such  usual  inertial
coordinate system.

The  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method  is  not  the
only one that each inertial frame of reference has. We imagine, for each inertial frame of reference, other
measurement  methods  that  are  different  from  the  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized
clock”  measurement  method.  By  taking  these  other  measurement  methods,  an  observer  in  each  inertial
frame  of  reference  can  set  up  other  inertial  coordinate  systems,  just  as  well  as  he  can  set  up  his  usual
inertial  coordinate  system  by  taking  the    “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”
measurement  method.  We  call  these  other  inertial  coordinate  systems  the  unusual  inertial  coordinate
systems.

The conventional belief in flatness of  gravity-free  space  and  time  is  natural.  But  question  is,  in
which inertial coordinate system the gravity-free space and time directly display their flatness. The special
theory  of  relativity  recognizes  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  as  shown  in  Eqs.(1).  Making  a
different choice, we take one of  the  unusual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  say  {x’r,t’},  r=1,2,3,  the  primed
inertial coordinate system. We assume that gravity-free space and time possess the flat metric structures in

4

the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  and  the  following  generalized  Finslerian  structures  in  the  usual
inertial coordinate system,

rsdx’rdx’s=grs(y)dxrdxs,   r,s=1,2,3,

Two metric tensors grs(y) and g(y) depend only on directional variables ys, s=1,2,3,  and  become

VI. THE MODIFIED SPECIAL RELATIVITY THEORY

We now modify the special theory of relativity by combining the alternative assumption Eqs.(11),

instead of the assumption Eqs.(1), with the two postulates (i) and (ii).

If we define a new type of velocity, y’s=dx’s/dt’, s=1,2,3, in the primed inertial coordinate system
and  keep  the  well-defined  Newtonian  velocity  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  we  find  from  the
assumption Eqs.(11)

where y’=(y’sy’s)1/2, s=1,2,3. It is understood that two different measurement methods can be applied to a
motion when the motion is observed in an inertial frame of reference, one being the “motionless-rigid rod
and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method, the other one being associated with the primed
inertial coordinate system. As a result, two different velocities are obtained, primed velocity y’s (of the new
type)  and  Newtonian  velocity  ys.  Velocities  y’s  and  ys  are  two  versions  of  the  motion,  obtained  via  two
different measurement methods used in the inertial frame of reference. They are related by Eqs.(12)  and
(13).  The  Galilean  addition  among  primed  velocities  links  up  with  the  Einstein  addition  among  usual
velocities [22]. This statement can be easily seen in the one-dimensional case that

y’2= y’1 -u’=(c/2)ln[(c+y1)/(c-y1)] -(c/2)ln[(c+u)/(c-u)]

and

imply

y’2=(c/2)ln[(c+y2)/(c-y2)]

y2=(y1-u)/(1-y1u/c2).
In Eq.(13), as y goes to c, we get an infinite primed speed,

c’= lim y

c

Speed c’ is invariant in the primed inertial coordinate systems simply because speed c is invariant in the
usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  Speed  c’  is  really  a  new  version  of  the  light  speed,  its  version  in  the
primed inertial coordinate systems.

Let  IFR1  and  IFR2  be  two  inertial  frames  of  reference,  where  IFR2  moves  with  non-zero
Newtonian velocity us, s=1,2,3, relative to IFR1. IFR1 and IFR2 can use their own “motionless-rigid rod
and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement methods and set up their own usual inertial coordinate
systems  {xr
m,t’m},
m=1,2. Since the propagation velocity of light is c’ in both {x’r
2,t’2}, we have two equivalent
equations,

m,tm},  m=1,2.  They  can  also  set  up  their  own  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems,  {x’r

In the modified special relativity theory, the c’-type Galilean transformation stands between any
two  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems,  while  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  between  two
corresponding usual inertial coordinate systems. Substituting the assumption Eqs.(11) for the assumption
Eqs.(1)  does  not  spoil  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems. The modified special relativity theory keeps the constancy of the one-way speed of light and also
the  local  Lorentz  invariance  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system,  as  well  as,  the  c’-type  Galilean
invariance in the primed inertial coordinate system.

VII. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND DISCUSSIONS

In the context, we have introduced the primed inertial coordinate system, in addition to the usual
inertial  coordinate  system,  for  each  inertial  frame  of  reference.  We  have  assumed  the  flat  structures  of
gravity-free  space  and  time  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  and  their  generalized  Finslerian
structures in the usual inertial coordinate system. Combining this assumption with the two  postulates  (i)
and (ii), we have modified the special theory of relativity. The modified special relativity theory involves
two versions of the light speed, infinite speed c’ in the primed inertial coordinate system and finite speed c
in the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  It  also  involves  the  c’-type  Galilean  transformation  between  any
two  primed  inertial  coordinate  systems  and  the  localized  Lorentz  transformation  between  any  two  usual
inertial coordinate systems.

Consequently, we shall have to make a change in the physical principle. In the special theory of
relativity, the physical principle is the Lorentz invariance: All physical laws keep their forms with respect
to  the  Lorentz  transformation  in  the  usual  inertial  coordinate  system.  In  the  modified  special  relativity
theory, since it is the “motionless-rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method that
we use in our experiments, the physical principle is: The c’-type Galilean invariance in the primed inertial
coordinate system plus the transformation from the primed inertial coordinate system to the usual inertial
coordinate system. We write all physical laws in the c’-type Galilean-invariant form in the primed inertial
coordinate system and do all calculations in the c’-type Galilean-invariant manner. We finally transform
all calculation results from the primed inertial coordinate system to the usual  inertial  coordinate  system,
and compare them to experimental facts in the usual inertial coordinate system.

This new physical principle has been applied to reform of mechanics and field theory. Evidently,
relativistic mechanics is still valid in the usual inertial coordinate system, while field theory is freshened.
Any  field  system  can  be  quantized  in  the  primed  inertial  coordinate  system  with  use  of  canonical
quantization method. Evidently, any quantized field system will undergo a unitary transformation as it is
transformed from the primed to the usual inertial coordinate systems. Particle size defined in the primed
inertial  coordinate  system  is  an  invariant  quantity.  It  can  be  quite  involved  in  the  c’-type  Galilean-
invariant  calculations.  In  this  way,  the  modified  special  relativity  theory  and  the  quantum  mechanics
theory together will found a convergent and invariant quantum field theory. Readers who are interested in
detailed derivations for these may refer to Ref.[23].

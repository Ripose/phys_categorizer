ABSTRACT

A  microstrip  configuration  has  been  loaded  with  a  left-handed  medium  substrate  and  studied

regarding its dispersion diagrams over the microwave and millimeter wave frequency bands for a

number  of  different  modal  solutions.    Ab  initio  calculations  have  been  accomplished  self-

consistently with a computer code using a full-wave integral equation numerical method based

upon a Green’s function employing appropriate boundary conditions. Bands of both propagating

and  evanescent  behavior  have  been  discovered  in  some  of  the  modes.    For  such  modes,

electromagnetic field plots in the cross-sectional dimension have been made. New electric field

line and magnetic circulation patterns are discovered.

Tremendous interest in the last few years has occurred with the experimental realization

of  macroscopic  demonstrations  of  left-handed  media,  predicted  or  at  least  suggested  in  the

literature several decades ago [1].  Attention has followed on the focusing characteristics of left-

hand media, with appropriate arrangements to accomplish such behavior, as shown by literature

publications  [2-8].    But  no  attention  has  been  directed  toward  what  left-handed  media  could

accomplish in propagating devices used in integrated circuit configurations.  Much of the work

to date has looked at macroscopic realizations, which may be amenable in the future with current

efforts  on  metamaterials,  to  advancing  microwave  integrated  circuit  component  technology

utilizing left-handed media.

There may be substantial interest in understanding the effects of left-handed media in

guided wave structures since advances in integrated circuit technology, in passive components,

control components, and active devices has increasingly  been utilizing layers and arrangements

of many differing materials.  From heterostructures in active devices to complex materials like

chiral, ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials, in passive structures and control components,

this trend has been increasing.  Efforts in metamaterials is sure to further this trend.

We  have  found  that  modifying  the  anisotropic  properties  of  ferroelectric  permittivity

tensors [9, 10] subject to static electric bias field [11] results in varying propagation behavior.

Similarly, we have found layers of ferromagnetic materials to undergo significant permeability

tensor [12] changes with change of static bias field magnitude and direction, and magnetization.

Examination of the electromagnetic field distribution which comes about from the nonreciprocity

2

embedded  in  the  asymmetric  permeability  tensors,  demonstrates  the  ability  to  modify  the

intensity and field line directions of the electric and magnetic fields.

In this Letter, we report on the new physics associated with altering the electromagnetic

fields  of  guided  wave  propagating  structures  using  left-handed  media  at  microwaves  and

millimeter waves.  Here we will only address the use of left-handed media with permittivity and

permeability tensors reducing to scalars  ε(ω)  and  µ(ω).    Clearly,  both  by  individual  unit  cell

construction and repetitive cells in favored directions, anisotropy can be introduced.  As seen

already in the literature, obtaining the characteristics of left-handed behavior, i.e. where Re[ε(ω)]

< 0 and Re[µ(ω)] < 0 simultaneously, may be a narrow band phenomenon [13 - 15].  (There are

some indications or thoughts that non-resonant phenomena could eventually allow broader band

devices [16], although this idea has come from focusing studies.)  Thus the frequency region ∆ω

over which the desired behavior occurs may almost be viewed as being created by a Dirac delta

selection function operating on the structure characteristics about a particular ω.  So in order to

study what a left-handed substrate would do in a certain configuration at a particular frequency,

we merely need to set Re[ε(ω)] = - εr and Re[µ(ω)] = - µr where  εr , µr = real positive constants.

Sweeping the frequency over a range for these settings will yield the interaction of the guiding

structure on the left-handed medium, giving the fundamental guided wave behavior.

The Green’s function for the problem is a self-consistent one for a driving current vector

Dirac delta function applied at the guiding microstrip metal, J = jxδ(x-x0) ˆx + jzδ(x-x0) ˆz (x0 = 0

3

for  a  centered  strip).    Although  this  Green’s  function  is  isotropic,  it  comes  from  a  general

spectral domain (Fourier transform) approach which is anisotropic.  The Green’s function is a

dyadic, constructed as a 2×2 array relating tangential x- and z-components of surface current

density to tangential electric field components.  This Green’s function is used to solve for the

propagation  constant.    Determination  of  the  field  components  is  done  in  a  second  stage  of

processing,  which  in  effect  creates  a  large  rectangular  Green’s  function  array,  of  6×2  size  in

order to generate all electromagnetic field components, including those in the y-direction normal

to the structure layers.  The self-consistent problem is solved by expanding the surface currents

on  the  guiding  microstrip  metal  in  an  infinite  expansion  J

 and then requiring the determinant of the resulting system of equations to be

zero.    At  this  step  of  the  problem,  only  the  basis  current  functions  need  be  provided  and  the

complex propagation constant  γ  = α  + jβ is returned  by  the  code.    Of  course,  the  summation

limits nx and nz must be truncated at an appropriate value where convergence is acceptable.

Acquisition  of  the  electromagnetic  fields  necessitates  obtaining  the  basis  function

expansion  coefficients  axi  and  az i  ,  explicitly  constructing  the  actual  driving  surface  current

density on the microstrip metal, finding the resulting top or bottom boundary fields, and then

utilizing operators Pu,d to pull up or down through the structure layers, generating the electric and

magnetic fields in the process.  Theory of Pu,d operators is in [17] and their use in line plots in

4

[18], the Cayley-Hamilton theorem in the Green’s function for matrix exponentiation is in [19],

and eigenvalue-eigenvector theory in the determination of Pu,d with its matrix exponentiation is

found in [17].  The entire solution method uses the constraint that the vertical side walls of the

device  are  perfect  electric  walls,  which  can  be  shown  to  discretize  the  eigenvalues  in  the  x-

direction.  These are the Fourier transform variables for the spectral domain, and an infinite set

of  them  forms  a  complete  set  for  the  problem.    Only  a  finite  number  of  them are used, their

maximum number being denoted by n.

To gain some idea of the trend of the propagation constant γ = α+iβ, a dispersion diagram

is graphed in Fig. 1 (color; α is in dashed green, β in solid blue) between 1 and 100 GHz for a

device with air above the substrate and left-handed medium below with Re[ε(ω)] = - εr = - 2.5

and Re[µ(ω)] = - µr = - 2.5, substrate thickness hs = 0.5 mm, microstrip width w = 0.5 mm, air

region thickness ha = 5.0 mm, and vertical wall separation 2b = 5.0 mm. Also, Im[ε(ω)] = - εi =

0.0 and Im[µ(ω)] = - µi = 0.0 making the medium lossless (We also consider the microstrip metal

lossless, although modifications for loss can be made [20].).  There are two roots shown for even

symmetry of the Jz surface current component.  They are mirror images of each other, with the

correct sign of α in γ in the region of evanescence from 6.5 GHz to 74 GHz (exp[-γz] needs α >

0 for forward propagation z > 0 when time dependence is exp{iωt] and β > 0).   We identify

these modes graphed as the fundamental modes since they exist even as ω 

 → 0 .  Figure 1 inset

(color)  shows  a  blowup  of  the  previous  dispersion  diagram  between  1-6  GHz  for  these

5

fundamental modes plus the next two higher order even symmetric modes.  Out of the region of

evanescence, α goes identically to zero, producing a pure propagating mode (only β ≠ 0).  These

dispersion  diagrams  were  produced  with  nx  =  nz = 1  although  we  have  found γ  solutions at

selected frequencies up to nx = nz = 9, the change in numerical value being in the fourth decimal

place.

Propagation constant was determined to be γ = (0.0000, ± 2.22663) for the fundamental

and (0.0000, ± 4.9556) for the first higher order mode at f = 5 GHz in the propagating region.  In

the evanescent region, the fundamental mode has γ  = (± 0.9394, ± 2.1341) at 10 GHz.  In the

millimeter wave propagating region at 80 GHz, there are many solutions, and we list the two

fundamentals and the next four higher order modes;  γ = (0.0000, ± 1.7886), (0.0000, ± 1.1777),

(0.0000, ± 0.90225), (0.0000, ± 0.87369), (0.0000, ± 0.69613), and (0.0000, ± 0.65065).

Figure 2 (color) shows a field line plot of the electric E  (blue)  and  magnetic H fields

(red) at 5.0 GHz for the fundamental mode with the line discretization set at about 0.02 mm.

Physics  of  the  field  line  directions  is  different  for  structures  with  left-handed  media  than  for

those with only regular media.  This is very clearly evidenced in Fig. 2 for the propagation case.

left-handed medium.  This is precisely what occurs, as E field lines point downward above and

upward  below  the  microstrip.    The  enclosing  surface  S  may  be  imagined  as  a  closed  line

encircling  the  microstrip,  with  its  normal  pointing  outward,  the  direction  of  the  differential

element ds.  By extending the Stop surface contour along the x-axis exactly through the center of

the metal, making it closed, and doing the same for the SLHM surface contour, these integrations

being opposite and through E = 0, form representations of the upper or lower components of the

bilayer  charges.    The  particular  charge  distribution  seen  on  the  metal,  in  terms  of  both  its

infinitesimal  y  separation  and  x-distribution  (the  main  contribution  produces  a  z-directed

symmetric “u-shaped” Jz) will vary of course, depending on the particular mode examined.

This has exactly the same form as (3), and we may wonder if here as well the contour pieces

have some relationship to each other in terms of their polarity.  They do and this is discovered if

we examine the continuity condition for magnetic field B at the ordinary dielectric/left-handed

medium interface located at, say some x < 0 off of the microstrip metal, that is for b < x < -w/2.

Normal B field components must be continuous across the interface, whereas tangential H field

components must be discontinuous by the surface current Js.  Thus,

Applying (11b) and (12) at the interface for b > |x| > w/2 means that the magnetic field lines

above and below the interface must both point toward or away from the interface.  This is indeed

the case as seen in Fig. 2.  And it is found that integral  B

A different visualization technique is provided in Figs. 3 (color) and 4 (color) to complete

arrows  sized  according  to  magnitude.    Figs  3  and  4  are  produced  from  a  grid  of  8372  points

stored  in  a  1  MB  file.    Finally,  power  flow  is  given  by  the  Poynting  vector  P  =  E × H.

Assessment of P using only the cross-sectional fields yields information about the propagation in

9

the  guide  direction,  ˆz ,    so  P guide =  P ⋅ ˆz   =  E t

distribution, and also shows the regions where a reversal from the dominant positive flow occurs.

Another important question is causality.  Although the calculations presented here and in

[21] have taken the LHM substrate loss as zero, we have performed additional simulations with

loss in the LHM by letting εi = - 0.0025 (Im[ε(ω)] = - εi > 0) at f = 5 GHz.  This leads to causal

waves which decay in either the ± z directions for, respectively, α, β > 0 or α, β < 0.  Change of

the γ eigenvalue due to the added loss is small, with no apparent change in β, α/k0 rising from 0

to 0.002062.  Current expansion coefficient change is from [ax1, az1] = [(0,-1.2043 × 10-3), (1,0)]

to [(-4.7273 × 10-7, -1.2043 × 10-3), (1,0)] and the field components change in the 4th decimal place

or higher, causing no visual alteration of the field distributions.

In conclusion, demonstrations of guided wave propagation (and non-propagation) down a

guided wave left-handed structure has been elucidated in terms of the new physics.  Completely

new  propagation  constant  behavior  and  field  arrangements  suggest  the  possibility  of  entirely

different types of  devices for future electronics compatible with integrated circuit and solid state

technology.

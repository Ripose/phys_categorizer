Abstract 

Accidentology  or  shock  biomechanics  are  research  domains  mainly  devoted  to  the 

development  of  safety  conditions  for  the  users  of  various  transport  modes  in  case  of  an 

accident.  The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  improve  the  knowledge  of  the  biomechanical 

behaviour  of  the  lower  limb  facing  sudden  dynamic  loading  during  a  frontal  collision.  We 

aimed at establishing the relationship between the level of muscular activity prior to impact, 

called  'preactivation',  of  the  lower  limb  extensors  and  the  mechanical  characteristics  of 

impact.  Relationships  were  described  between  the  level  of  preactivation,  the  impact  peak 

force  values,  the  minimum  force  after  unloading  and  the  associated  loading  and  unloading 

rates.  The  existence  of  reflex  mechanisms  that  were  affected  by  the  level  of  voluntary 

muscular  preactivation  for  the  lower  limb  muscles  was  demonstrated.  In  conclusion,  the 

existence of specific mechanism acting mainly at the knee level may result from the level of 

preactivation. Muscle behavior has to be included in numerical models of the human driver to 

better evaluate the overall stiffness of the body before and at impact.

1. INTRODUCTION 

The increasing use of passive restraint systems such as seatbelts and airbags for drivers in car 

occupants  leads  to  an  apparent  increase  of  lower  limb  injuries  resulting  from  automotive 

accident [1] and might become more prevalent in years to come [2, 3]. Biomechanical studies 

of  collision  tests  contributed  to  improve  the  knowledge  of  the  effects  of  these  systems  on 

internal and external integrity of human body. Injuries inferred by the collision were most of 

the time indirectly studied via post mortem human surrogates (PMHS) or dummies paradigms 

in  simulated  or  real  collisions  [4,  5].  However,  recent  epidemiology  studies  [6]  pointed  out 

the  important  occurrence  of  lower  limb  injuries  which  are  not  predicted  by  the  simulation 

models.  None  of  the  existing  experimental  paradigms  considered  the  effect  of  muscle 

activation especially the functional responses of the musculo-skeletal system. Bracing occurs 

when  a  car  occupant  is  aware  of  an  imminent  collision  and  should  affect  musculoskeletal 

responses  as  the  mechanical  characteristics  of  impacts.  Muscle  activation  and  more 

particularly  muscle  stiffness  has  often  been  considered  as  a  regulated  property  of  the 

neuromuscular  system.  From  a  mechanical  perspective, stiffness describes the ratio of force 

response  of  a  material  to  an  imposed  change  in  that  resists  mechanical  stretch  perturbation. 

This  resistance  limits  joint  motion,  minimizing  ligamentous  strain  and  subsequent  injury. 

Thus, control of lower limb muscle stiffness may be a primary mechanism by which potential 

injury  resulting  from  collision  could  be  minimized.  Specifically,  as  it  was  shown  in  gait 

biomechanics  studies,  the  muscular  preactivation  appears  to  be  a  preparatory  requirement 

both  for  the  enhancement  of  force  production  during  the  braking  phase  and  for  timing  of 

muscular action with respect to ground contact [7]  

The  long-term  objective  of  such  study  is  to  supply  numerical  models  of  car  occupant  with 

 

 

 

muscular  response  behavioral  law  at  impact  based  on  biomechanical  and  neuromuscular 

experimental data. Volunteers will be preferred to PMHS or dummies as it was the case in the 

literature.  The  interest  of  such  study  is  to  understand  the  effect  of  lower  limb  muscle 

preactivation on impact dynamics.  

Even if it is obvious that an automotive collision exceeds the functional human boundaries [1, 

8] the imminent occurrence of a collision may generate protective behaviours both conscious 

and  reflex  [8,  9].  Similar  adaptations  are  reported  for  lower  velocity  range  obtained  from 

human sport performance, not included the motorsports [10-17]. These studies used a specific 

ergometer, the sledge [10], and emphasized the importance of muscle preactivation on impact 

force [18]. However, these observations were conducted in rebound performance testing with 

impact  forces  largely  inferior  (impact  velocity  from  1  to  4  m.s-1)  to  those  generated  by  an 

automotive  collision  (impact  velocity  from  8  to  14  m.s-1).  Most  of  the  studies  used  fatigue 

protocols [11-19] based on cycling exercises or using sledge ergometers to induce changes in 

the  preactivation  level  prior  to  impact.  These  studies  showed  the  occurrence  of  protective 

reflex  mechanisms,  even  in  case  of  sub-maximal  impacts.  In  a  frontal  car  crash  situation, 

protective  mechanisms  are  expected  to  occur  as  the  occupant  is  aware  of  the  coming  up 

collision.  

In  the  current  study,  sub-maximal  impact  velocity  was  used  to  test  volunteers  instead  of 

functionally  reductive  PMHS  or  dummies.  The  inclusion  in  the  existing  numerical  model 

(HUMOS1, European Project (Reference: BRPR970475)) of a behavioral law, characterising 

the  effect  of  muscle  action  to  be  closer  to  reality,  will  allow  to  take  into  account  muscular 

activation  modulation  around  impact  which  will  be  expressed  as  a  variable  resistance  force 

output.  The  activity  in  4  limb  muscles  was  monitored  and  the  volunteers  were  asked  to 

maintain a specific percentage of the global muscle activity before impact. 

 

The use of the sledge allowed the analysis of collision effects in the seating position. It also 

presents the interest of an adjustable antero-posterior inclination, which allows the control of 

the sledge seat velocity until impact. Other variables may be adjusted and controlled before 

impact: the initial position of the volunteer-seat, the angular positions and the stiffness of the 

involved body segments.  

In the present study a guiding device was affixed to the sledge seat to allow the subjects to 

push with their right foot to generate a predetermined level of force associated with muscle 

preactivation  before  impact:  25,  50,  and  75%  of  the  maximum  voluntary  force.  The 

participant was raised by the experimenter to a supra maximal dropping height corresponding 

to 200% of his individual maximal rebound height. The resulting impact velocity was on the 

average  4  m.s-1.  Although  lower  than  the  accidentology  impact  threshold,  this  velocity 

limitation  was  necessary  to  protect  the  volunteer  from  potential  musculoskeletal  injuries. 

Based  on  the  rebound  literature  such  testing  conditions  are  relevant  to  analyse  the  effect  of 

muscle preactivation in case of a forthcoming frontal collision.  

2. MATERIALS AND METHOD 

Ten  male  adults  (mean  age  27)  whose  mass  and  height  fitted  with  the  European  50th  male 

percentile (1.78 m, 77 kg) volunteered for this study. At the time of the experimentation they 

were  free  of  pain  and  injuries  to  their  lower  extremities.  The  experimental  protocol  was 

approved by the Ethics Committee (n° 04008- CCPPRB Marseilles 2). 

2.1. EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP 

Impacts were delivered to the volunteers using a specific sledge ergometer [19] in the sitting 

position. A lower limb guiding device developed by our team was affixed to the seat of the 

 

 

 

sledge and allowed the study of the effect of preactivation level on musculoskeletal behavior 

as well as on mechanical characteristics of impact. 

2.1.1.  Sledge ergometer 

The sledge ergometer includes a car seat on rails (Figure 1). The inclination of the rails can be 

adjusted  to  control  for  velocity  at  impact.  There  is  a  force  plate  (University  of  Jyväskylä, 

585*430*55  mm)  at  the  bottom  of  the  sledge,  orthogonal  to  the  rails  and  a  potentiometer 

(Leine & Linde) affixed to the seat to measure displacement. In the present study, the angle 

between the incline plane and the horizontal floor was set at 26° to obtain an impact velocity 

of approximately 4 m.s-1. The participant was secured onto the seat by a race car harness to 

avoid flexion of the trunk. The perpendicular reaction force at the impact was recorded by the 

force plate. 

 

2.1.2. The guiding device  

This device (Figure 2) allowed subjects to preactivate leg muscles to predetermined levels by 

pushing  on  a  foot  support  with  respect  to  the  functional  integrity  of  the  lower  limb.  In 

addition  it  permitted  to  maintain  the  limb  joints  in  determined  angular  positions  prior  to 

This device consisted of a metallic structure aligned with the seat base. The aluminium plate 

at the bottom of the guiding device was designed for foot support and was equipped with a 

strain  gauge  sensor  (Wheatstone  bridge).  The  volunteer’s  right  forefoot  (from  toes  to 

metatarsals)  was  in  contact  with  the  aluminium  support.  Using  this  system  the  three  lower 

limb joints were set at specific angles, and the foot kept parallel to the force plate at impact. In 

addition, its sliding structure allowed flexion of the leg joints at impact.  

impact.  

 

The  strain  gauge  signal  of  the  guiding  device  was  monitored  by  a  Virtual  Instrument 

developed  with  acquisition  software  (LABVIEW  v.6.0)  and  was  displayed  as  a  feedback 

control for the participant on a computer monitor using a numerical slider.  

2.1.3. Surface Electromyography (EMG) 

Disposable  bipolar  EMG  surface  electrodes  were  positioned  at  a  constant  inter-electrode 

distance  of  20  mm  on  selected  extensor  muscles  of  the  right  lower  limb:  Vastus  medialis 

(VM), Gastrocnemius medialis (GAM), and Soleus (SOL) muscles (Figure 3). Skin preparation 

and positioning  of  the electrodes were done in accordance with SENIAM recommendations 

[20]. 

EMG  signals, vertical  impact force, force  signal from guiding device and seat displacement 

were synchronised and recorded using a portable system (MEGA 3000E, MEGAElectronics) 

with a sampling frequency of 2000 Hz, a signal amplification of 412 (EMG preamplifier gain: 

375), and an 8-500 Hz band-pass filter (3 dB points). 

2.2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 

 

Maximal Height: Maximal height was found using a squat-jump maximum (Sjmax) test. This 

test  consists  in  a  maximal  unilateral  jump  performed  in  a  sitting  position  (hip  angle  about 

120°,  knee  angle  set  at  90°)  on  the  sledge.  These  tests  were  realised  without  the  guiding 

device. To obtain the individual maximal jump height, the seated participant pushed himself 

away from the force plate with his right leg. This test was repeated three times. The highest 

performance was considered to be the maximal height. 

- Maximal force and maximal voluntary contractions: The participant was tightly secured on 

the  seat.  He  was  asked  to  push  quickly  and  as  hard  as  possible  against  the  support  of  the 

 

 

 

guiding  device  to  measure  maximal  force  production.  Isometric  maximal  voluntary 

contractions  (MVC)  were  also  recorded  for  each  monitored  muscle  to  record  a  maximal 

muscular  force  output.  In  the  present  study  the  hip,  knee  and  ankle  joint  angles  were  kept 

constant. Three 3-second trials were performed for each muscle as well as for maximal force 

production. The participant rested for 2 minutes between each contraction. 

- Crash test (CT): The dropping height was set at 200% of the maximal height reached 

in the SJmax test (Figure 4). The participant was secured onto the car seat and had his right 

foot resting on the guiding device foot support.  Four conditions  were examined. In the first 

one, so-called 'free condition', the unique instruction was to actively resist the impact while 

contacting the force plate. In the three other conditions, a visual feedback allowed the subject 

to generate either a 25, 50 or 75%, of his maximal lower limb force on the forefoot support of 

the guiding device (MVC) from the release until the impact. These conditions will be referred 

to as 25, 50, and 75% preactivation force. Each crash condition was repeated three times. The 

free condition was performed first, and the three other conditions were performed in random 

order. 

3. DATA ANALYSIS 

Impact  force  was  normalised  relative  to  the  subject’s  mass.  Peak  force  at  impact  (C), 

minimum force after unloading (D), loading rate (A), and unloading rate (B) were measured 

for each individual experiment from the force plate data (Figure 5). 

Displacement  of  the  seat  was  recorded  from  the  potentiometer  and  its  first  derivative  was 

computed. 

The EMG data were normalised relative to MVC and band-pass filtered using a zero-lag 4th 

order  Butterworth  filter  (10-350Hz).  It  was  then  full-wave  rectified  and  low-pass  filtered 

 

 

 

using  a  zero-lag  4th  order  Butterworth  with  a  75Hz  cut  off  frequency  to  determine  the 

envelope  (SENIAM  recommendations  [20]).  The  muscular  reflex  response  to  a  mechanical 

stimulus  can  be  characterised  by  a  short  latency  component  called  M1  whose  occurrence 

depends on the distance of the monitored muscle to the spinal cord. The reflex latencies for 

the  Vastus  Medialis  were  reported  at  30-60  ms  [20,21]  and  at  40-70  ms  for  the  Soleus  and 

Gastrocnemius medialis. Three temporal phases were identified: preactivation (100 ms before 

impact), central “0-M1” (impact until beginning of reflex response: 0-30ms for VM, 0-40 ms 

for SOL and GAM) and reflex “M1” phase [20, 22]. The post impact 0-M1 and M1 phases 

are useful to express the central and reflex drive. For each of the temporal phases, area under 

the EMG envelop was computed for each individual trial. Results for force generated before 

impact,  impact  force,  and  muscle  activation  were  averaged  for  the  three  trials  of  each 

condition in each subject. 

 
4. RESULTS 

4.1. FORCE BEFORE IMPACT 

contacting the force plate.  

 

 

The  force  from  the  guiding  device  reflected  the  overall  lower  limb  force  output  before 

The computed values for the three preactivation conditions ranged from 2.9 N/kg to 18.6 N/kg 

at release (Table 2). The average normalised force at release was 4.8 N/kg, 9.7 N/kg, and 14.5 

N/kg  for  the  25%,  50%  and  75%  preactivation  levels,  respectively.  However,  the  mean 

normalised  force  generated  between  release  and  impact  ranked  from  4.8  N/kg  to  5.4  N/kg. 

The  force  output  varied  with  the  approach  of  the  collision,  the  25%  preactivation  condition 

was in average maintained from the release until the collision (25% at release, 24% for mean 

force).  This  was  not  the  case  nor  for  50%  condition  (50%  at  release,  35%  for  mean  force) 

neither for 75% condition (75% at release, 38% for mean force). 

4.2. IMPACT FORCE  

 
The  analysis  pointed  out  the  influence  of  muscle  preactivation  on  the  dynamics  of  impact. 

The average force associated with their corresponding range was calculated for each level of 

preactivation (Figure 6). As expected, a relationship was found between the initial force level 

and  the  impact  peak  value  (Table  2;  Figures  7  and  8).  The  free  testing  condition  appeared 

clearly as generating the lowest peak amplitude. 

The increase in the level of preactivation matched with the highest magnitude of peaks force. 

In  all  experimental  conditions,  the  amplitudes  of  the  normalized  peak  force  values  varied 

from 38 N/kg to 55 N/kg and the time to peak was about 3 ms. It is interesting to observe that 

the increase of impact force is proportional with the increase of preactivation.  

Considering  the  loading  and  unloading  rates,  the  analysis  pointed  out  in  all  experimental 

conditions  that  negligible  force  data  scattering  was  encountered  at  the  first  rate  of  loading. 

The  rate  of  loading  (A)  increased  with  the  augmentation  of  the  level  of  preactivation  force 

(Table 3). The loading rate expressed the shock acceptance by the lower limb’s structures or 

'passive response' and by the active capacity to provide specific responses, i.e. force increase 

or plateau. On the contrary, after impact, the rate of unloading (B) declined with the increase 

of  the  level  of  preactivation  force  (Table  3).  In  addition,  the  increase  of  the  level  of 

preactivation increases the magnitude of the force minimum (Figure 9). 

4.3  MUSCULAR ACTIVATION 

 

In parallel to the analysis of force generated before and after the impact, the activity of three 

lower-limb muscles was studied. The short latency reflex (M1) was severely affected by the 

increase of peak loading, as expected. Because the latency of M1 for both GM and SOL was 

identical, the processed EMG was added and noted Triceps surae (TS), which is functionally 

 

 

relevant. M1 only occurred with 30 ms latency for VM (40 ms for TS (GM+SOL)) from the 

impact and lasted 30 ms for both VM and TS.  

The  EMG  content  observed  before  M1  is  called  0-M1  and  mainly  represents  central  drive 

while  M1  should  reflect  reflex.  Despite  the  equivalent  areas  for  0-M1  for  the  lower  limb 

extensors muscles with the preactivation (Figure 10), an EMG burst attributed to a reflex loop 

facilitation  was  observed.  Moreover,  the  increase  of  the  level  of  preactivation  corresponded 

with higher magnitude of the reflex facilitation (Figure 11). 

5. DISCUSSION 

The  current  study  aimed  at  measuring  the  effects  of  preactivation  level  on  impact 

characteristics.  The  subjects  felt  from  twice  their  maximal  jumping  height  to  obtain  a  high 

impact  velocity  without  causing  injury.  In  the  literature,  only  maximal  jumping  height  of 

130% was found [20]. In addition, the overall force generated by the lower limb muscles and 

measured on the guiding device was chosen to express the percentage of preactivation given 

to the volunteer as feedback.  

5.1. EFFECT OF PREACTIVATION ON IMPACT FORCE  

One  of  the  objectives  of  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  the  influence  of  preactivation  on 

impact peak force. The results validated the existence of such relationship between the level 

of  preactivation  and  the  impact  peak  force  amplitude.  The  calculated  relationships  between 

normalised  force  output  and  level  of  preactivation  were  not  proportional.  The  averaged 

increase  between  testing  conditions  was  2  N/kg  which  was  considered  meaningful  in  the 

domain  of  biomechanics  [24].  Actually,  the  statement  of  a  'biomechanically'  meaningful 

threshold means that the force difference is perceived by the different proprioception sensors 

 

 

 

 

(muscle  spindles,  Golgi  organs,  and  cutaneous  mechanoreceptors)  and  by  consequence 

potentially regulated. In other words such increase in peak force value may have a mechanical 

effect on musculo-skeletal and osteo articular structures. 

Otherwise the participant could not or would not maintain the same amount of force on the 

foot support until the impact. For example 75% preactivation actually corresponded to 38% of 

maximal force at impact and 50% pre-impact force corresponded to 35% of maximal force. 

Therefore,  the  demands  of  the  task  (≥50%  preactivation)  in  terms  of  level  of  muscular 

contraction cannot be maintain through the gliding. 

Impact force output can be characterized by rates of loading and unloading around the impact 

peak force. In this study, loading rate before the impact peak was not affected by the level of 

preactivation  which  reflected  the  consistency  of  the  behaviour  of  passive  structures.  The 

unloading rate following the impact peak showed a different temporal pattern with a decline 

of the value of the slope with the increase of preactivation. This had to be interpreted jointly 

with  the  variation  of  the  force  minimum  which  was  found  to  decrease  with  a  decline  in 

preactivation. In fact the volunteer provided a better push off with his impacting leg when the 

preactivation  constraint  before  impact  increased  due  to  the  inability  to  maintain  the  guiding 

device.  From  these  results  it  could  be  concluded  that  the  lower  limb  was  stiffer  when  the 

preactivation  was  higher  at  impact  due  to  the  increase  of  muscle  activity.  On  the  contrary, 

after impact, the  increase of  the  level  of  force preactivation corresponded with the less stiff 

slope (analysis of the first rate of unloading). Thus the volunteer pushed off with his leg on 

the force plate to resist from the shock. The minimum force revealed that the increase of the 

level of preactivation resulted in a greater push off. 

5.2. EFFECT OF PREACTIVATION ON EMG  

 

 

The typical neuromuscular mechanism acting in different types of jumps leads to a dramatic 

inhibition of M1 reflex for low impact load [18].  

The  effect  of  preactivation  on  EMG  was  studied  in  the  literature  through  the  Stretch 

Shortening Cycle principle or behavior demonstrated for cyclic activity such as running and 

jumping  [22,  26  and  27].  The  main  idea  is  that  increasing  the  EMG  activity  before  landing 

will  prepare  the  system  in  high  tuning  the  myotatic  reflex  loop  whose  sensors  (the  muscle 

spindles)  are  sensible  to  muscle  length  variation  and  in  case  of  sudden  lengthening  will 

provide EMG bursts to prevent yielding.  

Muscle preactivation increased the amount of reflex activity in VM and TS. Compared to the 

25%  condition  VM  reflex  activity  presented  an  increase  of  16%  and  26%  for  the  50%  and 

75%  conditions,  respectively.  For  TS  an  increase  of  23%  and  24%  for  the  50%  and  75% 

conditions, were respectively noted.  

The  notification  of  an  EMG  burst,  attributed  to  reflex  loop  facilitation  providing  a  specific 

control of the muscle stiffness, may be partly achieved by segmental reflex potentiation.  

As a consequence the higher the level of preactivation was the higher the volunteer’s ability 

to  push  off  from  the  force  plate  instead  of  crashing  down.  In  addition  from  these  results,  it 

could be noted that the most solicited joint is the knee joint.  

As  expected,  the  existence  of  relationships  between  preactivation  and  impact  characteristics 

such as impact peak force value, minimum force after unloading, post impact EMG activity 

In  definitive  the  increase  of  the  amplitude  of  the  impact  peak  force  values  with  a  higher 

loading rate, the increase of reflex facilitation, the critical importance of the knee controlled 

by the Vastus medialis muscle, was illustrated. 

6. CONCLUSION 

was demonstrated. 

 

 

Present  results  indicate  that  in  the  case  of  a  forthcoming  collision,  the  general  behavior  is 

oriented towards the enhancement of the overall stiffness of the lower limb when the level of 

muscular preactivation was voluntarily increased [22].  

The mean force generated by the volunteer before impact and after release was different from 

the force at release; this suggested that he was not able to maintain the level of required force 

until  impact,  which  might  be  considered  as  a  protective  mechanism  aimed  at  decrease 

stiffness of the lower-limb. This modulation with the increase of preactivation was provided 

by an active mechanism i.e. a higher EMG activity of the Vastus medialis to counteract the 

consequence of the impact passive characteristics. It could be stated that the resulting impact 

force  cushioning  is  reflected  by  a  lower  unloading  rate  and  by  a  knee  flexion  following 

impact. It is worth noting that such EMG increase occurred in the M1 period which was reflex 

controlled.  

Results support the point that it is mandatory to include muscle behavior in numerical models 

of car occupants to better evaluate the overall stiffness of the body before and at impact. The 

overall stiffness, discussed in the literature, was in the best case taken into account under the 

form  of  a  numerical  constant  whereas  its  modulation  is  known  to  affect  largely  the 

mechanical  properties  of  the  shock  [10-15,  28].  The  improvement  of  numerical  models 

biofidelity  is  deeply  linked  with  the  implementation  of  a  behavioral  law  describing  muscle 

activity. In conclusion, the understanding of muscle influence on impact loading will help the 

development,  via  biorealistic  numerical  models,  of  passive  and  especially  active  security 

devices in the automotive domain.

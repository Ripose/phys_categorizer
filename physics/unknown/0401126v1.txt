ABSTRACT

Fusion  with  p11B  has  many  advantages,  including  the  almost  complete  lack  of
radioactivity  and  the  possibility  of  direct  conversion  of  charged  particle  energy  to
electricity,  without  expensive  steam  turbines  and  generators.   But  two  major  challenges
must be overcome to achieve this goal: obtaining average ion energies well above 100keV
and  minimizing  losses  by  bremsstrahlung  x-rays.   Recent  experimental  and  theoretical
work indicates that these challenges may be overcome with the dense plasma focus.

DPF  experiments  at  Texas  A&M  University  have  demonstrated  ion  and  electron
average energies above 100keV in several-micron-sized hot-spots or plasmoids. These had
density-confinement-time-energy  products  as  high  as  5.0  x1015 keVsec/cm3.  In  these
experiments  we  clearly  distinguished  between  x-rays  coming  from  the  hot-spots  and  the
harder radiation coming from electron beam collisions with  the anode.

In  addition,  new  theoretical  work  shows  that  extremely  high  magnetic  fields,  which
appear achievable in DPF plasmoids, will strongly reduce collisional energy transfer from
ions to electrons.  This reduction has been studied in the context of neutron stars and occurs
when ion velocities are too small to efficiently excite electron transitions between Landau
levels.  It  becomes  a  major  effect  for  fields  above  5  gigagauss.  This  effect  will  allow
average electron energies to stay far below average ion energies and will thus reduce x-ray
cooling  of  p11B.   In  this  case,   fusion  power  will  very  significantly  exceed  x-ray  emitted
power.  While  fields  of  only  0.4  gigagauss  have  so  far  been  demonstrated  with  the  DPF,
scaling laws indicate that much higher fields can be reached.

These  theoretical  predictions  need  to  be  tested  in  new  sets  of  experiments.   The
efficiency  of  energy  transfer  into  the  plasmoids  must  also  be  optimized.   Fortunately  the
compact and inexpensive nature of the DPF means that such work can be carried out with
modest  resources.   If  successful,  this  line  of  research  can  lead  to  power  production  with
costs more than an order of magnitude below those of current energy sources.

INTRODUCTION

Controlled  fusion  with  advanced  fuels,  especially  hydrogen-boron-11,  is  an
extremely attractive potential energy source.   Hydrogen-boron fuel generates nearly all its
energy  in  the  form  of  charged  particles,  not  neutrons,  thus  minimizing  or  eliminating
induced radioactivity. The main reaction, p+11B->  34He, produces only charged particles.
A secondary reaction, 4He+11B-> 14N +n does produce some neutrons as the alpha particles
produced by the main reaction slow down in the plasma, but only about 0.2% of the total
fusion energy is carried by the neutrons, whose typical energy is only 2.5 MeV. Hydrogen-

boron  fuel  also  allows  direct  conversion  of  charged-particle  energy  to  electric  power,
without the expensive intermediate step of generating steam for turbines.[1-3]

However,  fusion  with  such  fuels  requires  average  ion  energies  above  100  keV
(equivalent to 1.1 billion K) in a dense plasma.   Experiments reported here have met this
requirement and demonstrated electron and ion energies over 100 keV in a dense plasma
focus device which is compact and inexpensive.   This was achieved in plasma "hot spots"
or  plasmoids  that,  in  the  best  results,  had  a  density-confinement-time-energy  product  of
5.0 x1015 keVsec/cm3, a record for any fusion experiment and a factor of ten above the best
achieved in the much larger Tokamak experiments.[4]   To do this, the experiment used a
higher-than-usual operating pressure for the device, which increased particle energy. An X-
ray detector instrument measured the electron energies in a way that eliminated previously-
existing doubts that the hard X-rays were generated by the hot spots.

The  dense  plasma  focus  (DPF),  first  invented  in  1954,  is  far  more  compact  and
economical  than  other  controlled-fusion  devices.   It  consists  of  two  coaxial  cylindrical
electrodes  usually  less  than  30  cm  in  all  dimensions  in  a  gas-filled  vacuum  chamber
connected to a capacitor bank.  The total cost of such a device is under $500,000, for a 500
kJ  system.   It  is  capable  of  producing  high-energy  X-ray  and  gamma-ray  radiation  and
intense beams of electrons and ions, as well as abundant fusion reactions.[5]   In operation,
the capacitors discharge in a several-microsecond pulse,   the gas is ionized and a current
sheath, consisting of pinched current filaments, forms and runs down the electrodes.  When
the sheath reaches the end of the inner electrode (the anode), the filaments pinch together,
forming  dense,  magnetically-confined,  hot  spots  or  plasmoids.[6-8]   The  plasmoids  emit
soft  X-rays  with energy in the range of  several kiloelectron volts.   X-ray  pinhole images
have  demonstrated  that  the  plasmoids  are  tiny,  with  radii  of  a  few  microns  to  tens  of
microns.[9-10]    The  plasmoids  have  densities  in  the  range  of  1020  -  1021  /cm3  .    These
densities  have  been  measured  in  a  number  of  independent  methods  including  heavy  ion
fusion[11],  CO2  laser  scattering[12],  and  x-ray  line  intensities[13].These  plasmoids  emit
intense beams of accelerated ions and electrons[14-15].    Fusion neutrons are emitted from
the device in large quantities (up to 1013)

The role of the plasmoids in producing the fusion neutrons and the physical processes
involved  in  their  formation  and  maintenance  have  been  hotly  debated  among  DPF
researchers for decades. The model that best fits all the existing data makes the role of the
plasmoids central to neutron production.   This  model, initially developed by  Bostick and
Nardi[5],  and  confirmed  by  observations  of  several  groups  over  three  decades,  was
elaborated into a more quantitative theory by the present author[16,17]. In this model, the
electron beam transfers part of its energy to the plasmoid electrons, which generate X-rays
through  collisions  with  nuclei.   Through  a  plasma  instability  (probably  ion-acoustic),  the
electrons  then  transfer  part  of  their  energy  to  the  ions,  with  a  typical  delay  (in  our
experiments)  of  ~10  ns.   Ion  collisions,  generating  fusion  reactions  and  neutrons,  then
occur  [18].   When  the  ion  and  electron  beams  have  exhausted  the  magnetic  energy  that
confines the plasmoid, and partially or wholly evacuated the particles in the plasmoid, the
fusion reactions end.

The DPF routinely produces hard X-rays and gamma rays indicating the presence of
bremsstrahlung  radiation  from  high-energy  electrons  colliding  with  nuclei[17].   Together
with independent evidence, this indicated that the hot spots contained ions and electrons at
very  high  energies  in  the  range  of  interest  for  advanced  fuel  fusion  [11,16,17,18,20].
However, most researchers in the field have believed that the hard radiation was generated
not in the plasma itself but by the electron beam when it strikes the end of the anode, and
that  the  hot  spot  plasma  was  relatively  cool  with  electron  energies  of  only  several
kiloelectron volts, too low for hydrogen-boron fusion[21].   This key question of where the
hard x-rays came from remained unresolved by previous experiments.

2.  EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP

To  clearly  distinguish  between  the  radiation  from  the  anode  end  and  that  from  the
plasmoids, we used a cylindrical anode with 6-cm-deep recess at the pinch end (Fig.1).   In
this manner, the point where the electrons hit the anode, generating gamma rays, would be
separated in space from the plasmoids, which are located at the plasma pinch very close to
the end of the anode.  We blocked the line of sight between the bottom of the hole and a set
of  X-ray  detectors  with  a  5-cm-thick  lead  brick.   This  reduced  the  intensity  of  1  Mev
gamma  rays  by  50-fold.   The  line  of  sight  from  the  plasmoids  to  the  x-ray  detectors,  in
contrast, passed through a 1-mm Be window, which allowed all but the lowest energy X-
rays (below 1 keV) to pass.

Fig. 1. In a dense plasma focus, a small plasmoid or hotspot forms near the end of the anode, emitting an electron
beam towards the anode, an ion beam away from the anode as well as x-rays and neutrons from fusion reactions.
X-rays from the plasmoid pass through a 1 mm thick Be window to the x-ray detectors, but gamma rays from
collisions of the electron beam with the anode are blocked by a 5 cm thick lead brick.   Neutrons pass through
apertures  in  a  60-cm  concrete  shield  wall  to  neutron  detectors  at  9  m  and  17.4  m.   Lines  of  sight  of  the  two
neutron  detectors  are  ~90  degrees  apart  in  azimuthal  direction.   A  Rogowski  coil  at  65  cm  from  the  anode
measures the ion beam.

The experiments were performed at the Texas A&M University DPF facility that used
a 268 microfarad capacitor bank, charged to either 30 or 35 kV.   A shorter anode than is
customary was used to increase the fill pressure which theoretical models indicated would
increase the plasmoid density and particle energy[16,17].   For a given capacitor bank rise
time,  and  a  given  anode  radius,  the  length  of  the  anode  determines  the  optimum  fill
pressure.  This is because the current must peak at the time the plasma sheath arrives at the
end of the anode for a good pinch to occur.   The velocity of the sheath in turn decreases
with  increasing  fill  pressure.  So  the  longer  the  anode,  the  lower  the  optimal  pressure.

However,  if  the  anode  radius  is  reduced,  increasing  the  B  field  and   sheath  velocity,  the
same fill pressure corresponds to a longer anode.

With  the  existing  experimental  apparatus,  it  was  not  practical  to  change  the  anode
radius, which was fixed at 5.1 cm prior to this experiment.  To increase the fill pressure, the
anode  length  was  made  as  short  as  possible  while  still  getting  a  good  pinch.  The  fill
pressure  for  each  gas  mix  was  optimized  by  maximizing  either  neutron  yield  or,  for  He,
maximum dI/dt in the pinch.

   The  cathode  radius  was  8.6  cm,  anode  radius  5.1  cm,  anode  length  24  cm,  and

insulator length 7.5 cm.   A slotted knife-edge around the insulator base was employed to
enable  operation  at  the  higher  pressure.   Shots  were  fired  using  fill  gases  of  deuterium,
helium or helium-deuterium mixtures at a 50-50 ratio by ion number.   At 30 kV, optimal
fill  pressure  was  13  torr  for  D,  14  torr  for  He-D  and  16  torr  for  He.   Peak  current  was
typically  1.2-1.3  MA  at  30  kV  and  1.4-1.5  MA  at  35  kV.  Helium  was  used  as  a  fill  gas
because its µ and Z of 2 and 4 are relatively close to the average µ and Z of decaborane, the
likely fuel for hydrogen-boron reactions (µ =2.66, z=5.17).

To measure the energy of the X-rays and infer the electron energy, 300-micron, 3-mm
and  6-mm  thick  copper  filters  were  placed  in  front  of  the  three  X-ray  detectors  (NE102
scintillators  with  photomultiplier  tubes  (PMT)).   The  ratio  of  X-ray  intensity  at  a  given
instant  recorded  behind  the  6mm  filter  to  that  recorded  behind  the  300  micron  filter
provided a measure of average X-ray energy, since only the more energetic X-rays could
penetrate  the  thicker  filter.  Average  electron  energy  Te  was  calculated  by  comparing  the
ratio  of  the  6  mm/300  micron-filtered  signals  observed  to  that  calculated  for
bremsstrahlung  emitted  by  Maxwellian  distributions  of  electrons  at  different  electron
temperatures. The ratio of the 3-mm signal to the 300-micron signal was used to test if the
energy distribution was Maxwellian or non-Maxwellian. Alternatively, calculated electron
energy  was  also  on  the  basis  of  assuming   monoenergetic  electrons.  Remote  scintillators
and PMTs at 9.0 and 17.4 meters that were shielded by 5-cm thick lead bricks measured the
gamma ray pulses from the anode end, and the neutrons produced by deuterium fusion.

To  eliminate  the  possibility  that  radiation  from  off-axis  sources  passed  through  the
chamber wall, in later shots the sides of the detectors were also blocked with lead bricks.
However, results from earlier shots were very similar to those from later shots, so all data
was used.   RF noise from the pinch was suppressed with aluminum foil shielding, but still
interfered with the X-ray signals on some shots.   The following analysis utilized only the
shots with a S/N ratio of more than 8 to 1.   Shots with lower S/N had higher Te, so their
exclusion  does  not  affect  the  conclusions  presented  here.   In  the  D  and  D-He  shots,
confusion  of  X-ray  and  neutron  signals  was  avoided  since  the  neutrons  reached  the
detectors  140ns  after  the  X-ray  signals  and  were  relatively  small  due  to  the  1-2  mm
thickness of the X-ray scintillators.

The remote scintillators were calibrated for neutron detection against calibrated silver
activation  neutron  counters.   Their  sensitivity  to  gamma  rays  and  x-rays  was  calculated
based on data in the literature that related neutron to X-ray and gamma-ray sensitivity[22-
23].   They  were  cross  calibrated with  the  X-ray  detectors  (by  measuring  output  from  the
same  shot  with  all  lead  bricks  removed),  providing  an  absolute calibration of the X-ray
detectors.   The X-ray detectors were cross-calibrated with each other in several shots with
the  filters  removed.   Relative  calibration  measurements  were  consistent  to  within  10%.
The  accuracy  of  the  absolute  neutron  calibrations,  and  thus  of  the  absolute  X-ray
calibrations, is estimated to be better than 30%.

Prospects for P11B Fusion with the Dense Plasma Focus: New Results

In  all  but  one  of  the  eight  shots  with  highest  signal-to-noise  (S/N)  ratio,  average
electron energy Te exceeded 100 keV and peak Te generally exceeded 150 keV. These are
Te  calculated  on  the  Maxwellian  assumption.  (Table  1  shows  the  range  of  values)
(Calibration uncertainties of ±10% imply ±20% errors in Te.)   A high Te is required for the
high  ion  energy  needed  for   hydrogen-boron  fusion,  since  at  the  very  high  densities
required for net energy production collisions with electrons with average Te below 100 keV
will  cool  ions  too  rapidly  (although  high  B  fields  will  alter  this  situation  as  shown  in
section 5.).  By comparison, Te  in Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor experiments was, at most,
11.5 keV.

The  good  agreement  between  peak  Te calculated from the ratio of 6mm/300 microns
and that calculated from the ratio of 3 mm/300 microns shows that the results are consistent
with  a  Maxwellian  distribution.  (Fig.2)   However,  they  are  also  consistent  within
calibration errors with monoenergetic electrons.  In this case, average Te would range from
180 keV to 300 keV rather than from 80 keV to 215 keV for Maxwellian distributions.

The lead shields distinguished the X-rays generated by the plasmoids from the gamma
rays  coming  from  the  anode  tip.   This  demonstrated  that  we  were  indeed  measuring
electron energy in electrons trapped in the plasmoids, not just in the electrons in the beam.
As measured by the remote scintillators, the gamma ray pulse signals were between 60 and
180 times smaller than the x-ray peaks so they could not affect the x-ray results. (Figs.3,4)
For  many  of  the  shots,  including  all  the  He  shots,  the  gamma  ray  pulses  were  not
observable  at  all  with  the  shielded  detectors.   In  addition,  the  gamma  ray  pulses  did  not
resemble  the  x-ray  pulses,  being  4-6  times  shorter  in  duration  (FWHM)  with  rise  times
generally 15 times faster.   Finally, the fact that the X-ray pulses were not detectable when
filtered by the lead brick confirms that the X-ray energy is concentrated below 600 keV, in
contrast to the more than 1 MeV gamma rays from the anode.

There  was  a  tendency  for  Te  to  decrease  gradually  with  increasing  Z  in  the  fill  gas.
This  is  to  be  expected  if  the  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  from  the  electron  beam  to  the
plasmoid electrons is constant across the gases as is the ratio of total beam energy to total
particle number in the plasmoids. In this case, the increase in the ratio of electron number
to  total  particle  number  means  that  the  same  energy  is  spread  over  a  greater  number  of
electrons,  leading  to  a  decrease  in  Te  ~  (z+1)/z.   This  is  consistent  with  the  observations
summarized  in  table  1  and  would  extrapolate  to   a  range  of   between    75-140  keV  for
comparable  conditions  and  good  pinches.  This  is  well  in  the  range  of  interest  for  p11B
reactions.

3.2 PLASMA DENSITY

These results show clearly that the high energy X-rays are emitted from high-energy
electrons within the plasma.  But do they come from the high-density plasmoids or do they
come from a larger volume at lower density?

Fig.  2.  X-ray  power  output(solid  line),  electron  average  energy  Te  calculated  from  ratio  of  6mm/300  micron-
filtered output(dashed), Te from ratio of 3mm/330 micron filtered output (dotted) for a single D shot(shot 81705,
35 kV, 15 torr, 9x109 neutrons).  Te is in keV, while x-ray output, measured by 300 micron filtered detector, is in
units of 350 W total emitted power.  Time unit is 2ns. The close correspondence of the two measures of Te in the
latter half of the pulse is consistent with a Maxwellian electron distribution, while the higher 6mm/300 micron Te
in the earlier part of the pulse indicates a broader-than Maxwellian energy distribution.  Average Te for this pulse
is 200keV, and TI , derived from neutron time of flight measurement, is 300keV.   Note that x-ray pulse duration
and the overall X-ray energy emitted is considerably greater in this shot at 35kV, with peak current of 1.5 MA
than in Fig. 3, at 30kV and 1.3MA, showing rapid scaling of X-ray output.

We have determined the density of the plasma that produces the neutrons by the DD
reaction.   There is strong evidence that this is the same volume that traps the high-energy
electrons and produces the hard X-ray radiation (see Sect. 3.4).   In 25% of the deuterium
shots at optimum fill pressure (two out of eight), 14.1 MeV neutrons were observed.  These
14.1 MeV neutrons are produced by the fusion of deuterium nuclei with tritons produced
by  DD  fusion  reactions  and  then  trapped  in  the  high-density  regions  by  strong  magnetic
fields.  This was observed in one of the two deuterium shots with the best X-ray data (shot

Prospects for P11B Fusion with the Dense Plasma Focus: New Results

81602), as well as in one shot (shot 80910) that was made before the X-ray detectors were
functional(Fig.5).  Shot 80910 also had the highest number of DD neutrons(5x1010).

The DT neutrons were detected by time of flight measurements using the 9 meter and
17.4 meter scintillators. The DT neutron detection cannot possibly be cosmic rays or other
noise  sources.   The  delay  time  between  the  DT  neutron  peak  at  the  9  meter  detector  and
that at the 17.4 meter detector is identical (with the 2 ns measurement window) to that for
14.1 MeV neutrons in shot 81602 and differs by only 4 ns (1%) for shot 80910 (Fig.5). In
both  shots,  the  FWHM  length  of  the  DT  pulse,   τ,  is  10  ns,  significantly  longer  than  the
minimum width set by instrumental response times.   (The recovery time of the scintillator
and PMT is <1 ns, but since data is taken every 2 ns, the minimum pulse width observable
is 4ns and still well under the 10 ns recorded.) There are no other such pulses at unrelated
times  (except  for  the  much  earlier  gamma  ray  pulse).   While  the  number  of  neutrons
actually detected is not large (7 for shot 81602 and 3 for shot 80910), even a single 14.1
MeV neutron produced a pulse four times the instrument noise level and for shot 81602 the
peak is more than 25 times larger than the noise level (Fig.6).  The isotropic distribution of

2 kW; ion beam current in 5 A; Te in 10 keV; gamma ray output in 20 W of power through the shield.  All traces
are  referred  to  time  of  radiation  from  the  pinch  region.   The  shielded  gamma  ray  pulse  is  far  smaller  than  the
unshielded x-ray pulses and differs from it in shape and timing.   The gamma ray pulse generated by the electron
beam hitting the anode and the ion beam are clearly correlated as both are with the dI/dt pinch.   Heating of the
electrons in the plasmoid continues as the beam tails off, reaching a peak 14 ns later.

In these two shots, the ratio of the number of 14.1 MeV neutrons to the number of 2.45
MeV  neutrons  provides  a  direct  measure  of  density.   In  DD  plasma  approximately  0.9
tritons are produced by the D+D⇒T+p reaction for every 2.45 MeV neutron produced by

7

the D+D⇒3He+n reaction.  Thus the ratio of 14.1 Mev neutrons to 2.45 MeV neutrons is R
= 0.9F, where F is the fraction of tritons that undergo fusion.  Since

F = <σv>niτ,
where <σv> is the average product of the fusion cross section and the triton Maxwellian
velocity distribution, ni is the deuteron plasma density and τ is the confinement time for the

Fig. 4 Energy transferred to the ions leads to neutron emission (kW of total neutron power).   The broadening of
the  neutron  peak,  due  to  the  energy  spread  of  the  neutrons,  has  been  compensated  for,  although  the  peak  is
probably somewhat shorter in duration than portrayed here. (Shot 81602, 30 kV, 12 torr, 1.0 x1010 neutrons).

The  very  short  DT  pulse  duration,  10  ns,  implies  a  small  spread  in  triton  velocity
relative  to  the  axis  of  the  DPF.   (The  lines  of  sight  to  the  neutron  detectors  are
perpendicular to that axis.)  This is consistent with the model of the plasmoid developed by
Bostick, Nardi and other researchers and confirmed by x-ray pinhole images[10] in which
the plasmoid has an "apple core" structure aligned with the DPF axis.  Tritons contained by
the strong magnetic fields within the plasmoid encounter the highest density plasma, and
thus  the  most  chance  for  fusion  reactions  while  traveling  along  the  plasmoid  axis,  and
much lower density while re-circulating through the outer region of the plasmoid.

In shot 81602, F = 6.6±1x10-3and for shot 80910, F = 5.4±1.8x10-4.  The shot-to-shot
variability is typical of DPF functioning without optimization, which was not possible for
this  set  of  experiments.   We  calculated  n  on  the  assumption  that  the  tritons  did  not  slow
down  significantly  from  their  initial  1.01  MeV  energy  during  the  confinement  time,  and
that  DT  neutron  production  was  terminated  as  the  plasmoid  density  decayed.  Even  at  a
density of 3.3x1021/cm3, the energy loss time for tritons in ion-ion collisions is 55 ns, much
longer than τ, supporting the assumption that the tritons have not slowed substantially by
the end of the pulse. The energy loss time for the tritons at the same density in collisions

with electrons at 100 keV energy is longer still, 350 ns.   (A beam-plasma interaction that
slows the tritons collectively cannot be entirely ruled out, although we believe it unlikely.
If  the  tritons  are  slowed  down  to  low  energies  during  the  10  ns  pulse,  the  reaction  rate

could be increased by as much as 3.5, reducing the calculated density by the same factor.)

Fig. 5 In the same shot, Shot 81602, near the peak of neutron power, 14 MeV neutrons are emitted from collisions
of a beam of trapped tritium with deuterium   (kW of DT neutron power). This occurs only 4 ns after the X-ray
peak.

Given  the  above  assumption,  ni  =  3.3±0.5x1021/cm3  for  shot  81602  and
2.8±0.9x1020/cm3 for shot 80910.  This is a lower limit, since it is based on the assumption
that all the T has been produced in the plasmoid prior to the DT neutron pulse. If some of
the T has been produced after the DT pulse, or outside the plasmoid in the plasma column,
then  F  would  be  larger  than  the  value  cited  here  and  n   would  be  larger. This result
represents  a  peak  density.   We  take  the  average  density  to  be  half  these  values,
1.6±0.2x1021/cm3 for shot 81602 and 1.4±0.5x1020/cm3 for shot 80910.

We have ruled out any source for the DT neutrons other than a dense plasmoid where
the tritons are produced, along with the DD neutrons.  Collisions of tritons with deuterated
metal in either the chamber wall or the anode, even assuming (unrealistically) that there is
one  deuterium  atom  for  every  copper  or  iron  atom,  would  produce  a  burn  fraction  F  of
<2.7x10-5.  This is a factor of 10 less than that observed for shot 80910 and a factor of 120
less than that observed for shot 81602.  The tritons ejected in the ion beam will hit a copper
target which is not in the detector line-of-sight, further reducing any possible beam-target
contribution to the DT neutrons.

relative locations in the two traces. The central peak in (a) and the sole peak in (b) corresponds to 14.1 Mev DT
neutrons.   Note the high signal to noise ratios (25  to 1 in (a) and 40 to 1 in (b))and the lack of  any confusing
pulses.  In (a) the earlier peak (to the left) is the gamma ray pulse from the e-beam and the rise to the right is the
beginning of the much larger DD neutron peak, which begins in (b) a little to the right of the frame shown here.

,where V is the volume of the reacting region.

Therefore,  V  is  5.5x10-9  cm3,  indicating  a  core  radius  of  6  microns  and  an  overall
plasmoid radius of 24 microns.  This is comparable to the dimensions of hotspots observed
with pinhole X-ray cameras in many previous plasma focus experiments[6-8].

We  did  not  attempt  to  directly  measure  the  source  size  of  the  high  energy  X-rays  in
these experiments.   There are difficulties with measuring the radius of the source of high-
energy X-rays.  Use of a pinhole camera is routine for low-energy X-rays.  For a reasonable
field of view, a pinhole must be cut in material that is thinner than the pinhole diameter.
However,  to  have  adequate  contrast  for  X-ray  energy  above  100  keV,  the  lead  thickness
must be >200 microns, so resolution of tens of microns cannot be obtained in this manner.
(After  our  experiment,  Castillo-Mejia  et  al,[23]  using  an  image  intensifier,  published
results  demonstrating  that  the  source  size  of  hard  x-rays  in  their  smaller  PDF  was  of  the
order of 10 microns.  In this experiment, however, they did not distinguish between X-rays
from the plasmoids and gamma rays from the electron beam collision with the anode.)

For shot 81602, measurement of the emitted ion beam provides indirect confirmation
of the density estimate. Measurements with a 10 cm diameter Rogowski coil located at 65
cm from the end of the anode showed that the ion beam had a peak current of 140 A and
total ion number of 8.8x1012. Since the number of ions in the plasmoids niV must equal or
2V to set
exceed the number of ions in the beam, these measurements can combine with ni
an  upper  limit  on  ni  of  1.7x1021/cm3.   This  result  is  essentially  identical  to  our  estimate
from DT neutrons, implying that essentially all the ions are evacuated into the beam.

This observed equality of the ion number in the plasmoid and in the ion beam allows
an  estimate  of  the  density  of  other  shots  that  did  not  yield  DT  neutrons.  This  is  done  by
2V measured in each shot through X-ray or neutron observations by the beam
dividing the ni
ion number. This analysis indicates that ni ranges from 0.9-3.0x1020/cm3, with an average
of  1.5x1020/cm3  for  He  shots  and  2.5x1020/cm3  for  D  shots.   These  values  are  also
consistent with the non-observation of DT neutrons in the other D shots.  The factor of ten
variations  between  best  n  and  average  n  is  typical  of  DPF  functioning  without  extensive
optimization.

The average electron density ne for the He and D shots was the same to within 20%.
2V, we find
Since measurement of x-ray intensity allows the calculation for each shot of ne
that  V  for  the  He  and  D  shots  are  also  closely  similar.   This  in  turn  implies  that  the
assumption that the efficiency of energy transfer from the electron beam to the plasmoid
electrons is also similar for the two fill gases, made in  Sec 3.1, is probably justified.

It may seem surprising or even incredible that 100keV deuterons can be contained for
50 ns in a volume only 12 microns across in the shortest dimension.  The deuterons are thus
trapped  for  about  13,000  crossing  times.  But  the  observation  show  clearly  that  1.0  MeV
tritons are trapped for at least 10 ns or about 6,700 crossing times, so the containment of
the much less energetic deuterons does not thus appear so implausible.

It should be emphasized that the high densities measured in this experiment are quite
comparable to those measured by a variety of techniques in other DPF research[11-13]  and
are not in themselves surprising.   Many research teams have observed the same 1020-1021
/cm3  range  with  similar  operating  conditions.   However,  the  present  experiments  are  the
first in which Te >100keV are associated with such high plasma densities.

At these high densities, electron-electron collisional heating is rapid, so there cannot
be a cool background plasma with a high-energy component, meaning that essentially all
11

Eric J. Lerner

the  electrons  must  be  energetic.   For  200keV  electrons  with  a  density  of  1.4x1020  the
electron  heating  time  is  only  6  ns,  considerably  shorter  than  the  typical  20-50  ns  x-ray
pulse  duration,  and  for  n  =  1.6x1021  (shot  81602)  the  heating  time  is  only  0.5  ns.  If  we
assume  the  hot  electrons  are  kept  hot  by  the  beam,  then  enough  energy  would  be
transferred  to  the  cold  component  to  heat  it  up.  To  allow  a  hot  and  cold  (20  keV)
component  to  co-exist,  the  hot  component  must  have  an  average  electron  energy  >  1.3
MeV for n= 1.4x1020 and > 7 MeV for n=1.6x1021. Such high energy for a hot component
is completely ruled out by the x-ray absorption ratios observed.

Alternatively, can the cold electron component could be so much larger than the hot
component that it heats up slowly? The electron population in the energy range 10-50keV,
can be constrained directly because in some shots we removed the 300 micron copper filter
from one detector. (X-rays shorter than 10 keV would be filtered out by the 170 cm of air
in the line of sight to the DPF.) Comparing these observations with the 300 micron filtered
ones, the excess x-rays at low energy are at most 50% of the hot (200kev) x-ray emission.
This is consistent with an electron energy distribution somewhat broader than Maxwellian,
but again rules out a large cold component. A 20 keV cold component must have a density
nc < 3 nh to avoid violating these observational constraints.

But a cold component would have to be far more massive to avoid being heated up by
the  hot  comment.  In  the  case  of  shot  81602,  where  the  cooling  time  of  the  145Kev  hot
electrons in the presence of a cold compete is 80 times shorter than the x-ray pulse time, a
cold  component  would  have  to  have  nc  >  580  nh  to  avoid  being  heated  beyond  20keV.
Such a massive cool component can be rule d out if it has an average energy of 20keV or
more.  These x-ray observation cannot rule out an even colder component of 10keV or less,
but such a colder component will be ruled out by arguments in sec. 3.4 .

3.4 ION ENERGY AND CONFINEMENT TIME

Not  only  is  Te  high  in  these  plasmoids,  but  so  is  Ti,  ranging  from  45  to  210  keV.
(These Ti assume a Maxwellian distribution of ion energies.   For monoenergetic ions, the
range would be from 90 to 350 keV)[24].  For comparison, the ideal Ti for hydrogen-boron
fusion  is  600  keV.   For  Ti  =145keV,  the  reaction  rate  is  one  third  of  its  maximum.   The
highest Ti achieved by TFTR was 44 keV [4].

Ti  and  τ  for  the  DD  neutron  production  pulses  were  determined  as  follows.  The
FWHM of the neutron pulse was measured at 9 meters and at 17.4 meters.   We made the
simplifying assumption that the velocity distribution was Maxwellian.  On that basis

1) FWHM2 =  τ2+(t2Ti/2E),

where t is the transit time for a neutron of energy E to reach the detector and Ti is the ion
temperature,  averaged  over  the  duration  of  the  pulse.   (While  it  is  unlikely  the  velocity
distribution  is  in  fact  Maxwellian,  monoenergetic  ions  would  produce  a  different  shaped
neutron pulse than is observed, so a Maxwellian approximation appears roughly accurate.)

It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  path  between  the  plasmoids  and  the  neutrons
detectors  was  entirely  clear  of  scattering  walls,  except  for  the  0.5  cm  thick  vacuum
chamber wall.   So there is no interference from the scattered tail of the neutrons, which is
clearly distinguishable from the main peak.

For shot 81602, Ti is 55 keV and ion confinement time τ is 54 ns.  On this basis, nτ for
this shot is 9.2x1013 sec/cm3 and nτTi is 5x1015 keVsec/cm3, a record value for any fusion
experiment.   Simultaneous X-ray observations show an average Te of 145 keV.   For other
shots, which have smaller n but larger τ and Ti, nτTi is typically 1x1015 keVsec/cm3.

There is abundant evidence that the high-energy electrons that produce the hard X-rays
do in fact originate in the same dense hot spots that produce the neutrons.  Therefore Ti, Te
and n are all high in same time and space.   The X-ray pulses are closely correlated in time

Prospects for P11B Fusion with the Dense Plasma Focus: New Results

and duration with the neutron pulses, overlapping with them in all cases, and with the X-
ray peak preceding the center of the neutron pulse by only 5-18 ns (average 10 ns).   The
DT pulse peak for shot 81602 is within 4 ns of the X-ray pulse peak.  The duration of the x-
ray pulses and neutron pulses are closely correlated, with X-ray pulse duration, always 0.4-
0.55  that  of  the  neutron  pulse.   In  addition,  from  the  neutron  production,  pulse  duration,
and Ti, the quantity n2V was calculated for each deuterium shot using the standard formula

  The  same  quantity  can  be  calculated  from  Te  and  X-ray  power  for  the  D  shots  with

high X-ray signal to noise using

Where  Px  is  average  x-ray  power.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the  quantity  n2V
calculated in this manner does not depended on knowledge of n or V separately. In the case
of  the  x-ray  data,  both  Px  and  Te  come  directly  from  observations,  while  for  the  neutron
data  ni

 2V depends on the calculated values of t and Ti.

The  average  n2V  derived  from  the  neutron  data  is  1.7x1034/cm3,  while  that  derived
from  the  X-ray  data  is  2.2x1034/cm3,  essentially  identical.  For  shot  81602  the  n2V  of
1.5x1034/cm3 derived from X-ray data is  essentially identical to the 1.6x1034/cm3 that can be
derived from DD neutron emission, neutron pulse duration and ion energy Ti. These would
be extraordinary coincidences if the neutrons and X-rays did not in fact originate from the
same volume of plasma.

The high density-confinement-time product is important for fusion performance since
it  is  directly  proportional  to  the  fraction  of  fusion  fuel  burned.   For  comparison  the  best
nτTi achieved in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor was 5.5x1014 keVsec/cm3 with Ti of 44
keV and Te of only 11.5 keV[4].

Since  this  claim  may  seem  sensational,  given  the  far  larger  effort  expended  on  the
TFTR, it deserves some elaboration. First of all, the τ  of 54 ns derived from time of flight
neutron data can be independently confirmed from a different set of data for the same shot.
As  described  in  Sec.3.3,   x-ray  intensity  measurements,  together  with  measured  Te  yield
  2Vτ<σv>,   we
ni
have

2V = 1.5x1034/cm3. Since   the number of DD neutrons Yn is 1.1x1010 = ni

2) τ =  Yn /ni

 2V<σv> =58 ns,

essentially the identical result as the 54 ns derived from the time of flight data alone.

This good agreement is also a confirmation of the value   of Ti, since Ti enters into to
the  calculation  of  τ  in  different  ways  in  eq.(1)  and  (2),  where  <σv>.depends  on  Ti  For
example, if Ti is arbitrarily assumed to be 27keV (half its calculated value of 55keV), then
τ from TOF at via eq(1) become 83 ns and from x-ray measurements and Yn via eq (2) τ
becomes 162 nsec, a very poor agreement.   Indeed only for the range of Ti from 55keV to
63 keV would the agreement be as good as the 7% difference found for the calculated value
of 55 keV.

It could be argued that the time of flight data reflects bulk motion of the plasma, and
the true ion energy available for collisions is thus far less than Ti. But in that case the above
agreement would have to be viewed as an extraordinary coincidence.

It  could  be  objected  that  τ  is  not  a  true  ion  confinement  time,  since  the  same
observation would be obtained if a much large flow of ions through the plasmoid occurred,
so that the confinement time of each individual ion was much shorter than τ and therefore
the burn fraction smaller than that implied by the nτ quoted here.   If a quantity of ions N>

 V flowed through the plasmoid during the time τ ion confinement time would be reduced

 Vτ/N.
However,  this  would  not  affect  the  value  of  nτ.   The  tritons  generated  by  the  DD
reactions would also not be fully confined. At any given moment we would expect at most
a  fraction niV/N  of  the  tritons  generated  would  be  within  the  plasmoid.  This  assumption
would in turn increase the burn fraction F, which was calculated on the assumption that all
the tritium produced by the DD reactions was in the plasmoid at the same moment. If only
  V, and
a fraction ni
thus nτ would be unchanged. Our calculation of nτ  and thus nτTi  is a robust one. 

  V/N was present, the calculated n would be increased by a factor N/ ni

Similar arguments apply if it is assumed that more than one plasmoid are contributing
to  neutron  and  x-ray  production.   If,  say  N  plasmoids  all  contribute  to  the  DT  neutron
production  shown  in  Fig.  5  then  they  are  simultaneous  to  within  a  few  ns  and  could  not
masquerade as a much longer pulse, unless their lifetimes were also in the 50 ns range. If
only one plasmoid produces the entire DT pulse, with other plasmoids contributing to the
DD  neutron  production,  then  for  the  DT-producing  plasmoid,  n  must  be  increased  by  a
facet of N since only 1/N of the tritium is involved. Thus for five 10-ns plasmoids imitating
a single 50 ns pulse, n is increased by five times and τ is decreased by the same factor gain
leaving nτ unchanged.

If the Ti derived from TOF data are accepted as the valid values, we can put firm limits
2V
on any cold component in the plasmoid, even one colder than 10keV.  For shot 81602, ni
=1.5x1034/cm3,  which  means  that  (nc+nh)2V=1.5x1034/cm3  .  But  since  from  x-ray  data,  nh
(nc+ nh)= 1.6x1034/cm3 , essentially the identical figure, nc must be << nh.  An nc>580 nh ,as
required to avoid rapid heating, is clearly ruled out by this argument.

3.5 ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS 

Since  the  ultimate  aim  of  this  research  is  to  arrive  at  net  energy  production,  it  is
important to consider the efficiency of energy transfer at various stages of the plasma focus
process. To begin with the plasmoid itself, the minimum magnetic energy in the plasmoid
can  be  determined  from  the  observation  that  the  1.0  MeV  tritons  are  trapped  within  the
magnetic field for a period of 10 ns.  Since the crossing time of the plasmoid for the tritons
with v=7.9x108 cm/s, was only1.5 ps, magnetic confinement clearly occurred, which meant
that  the  gryoradius  of  the  tritons  must  have  been  less  than  the  radius  of  the  core  of  the
plasmoid. Thus,

vMc/eB< r,

where M is the mass of the triton and v its velocity. This condition can only be met if the
current in the plasmoid core Ic> 1.2 MA.   For shot 81602, with a core radius of 6 microns
and a core length of 48 microns (with the aspect ratio being set equal to that observed in
many  other  experiments)  minimum  B  is  4x108  G  and  minimum  magnetic  field  energy  is
3.5 J.   The plasmoid current would then be essentially the same as the peak input current
and  the  B  field,  while  large,  is  within  the  range  observed  in  several  other  DPF
experiments[5 ].

The thermal energy of the ions and electrons combined can be calculated from nVTe
and Ti and is 0.3J assuming a Maxwellian distribution or 0.5J assuming monenergetic ions
and electrons. Total plasmoid energy must therefore be >3.8J.

We  can  compare  this  energy  with  that  emitted  by  the  ion  beam.   Time  of  flight
measurement using the two Rogowski coils show that ions in the beams have energies that
are peaked consistently in the range of 1.1-1.5 MeV.   In shot 81602 the beam had a peak
current  of  140  A,  total  power  of  180  MW  and  total  energy  of  1.8  J.   Since  the  electron
beam, accelerated by the same field within the plasmoid, must have had the same energy

Prospects for P11B Fusion with the Dense Plasma Focus: New Results

initially  (before  some  of  its  energy  was  transferred  to  the  plasmoid  electrons)  total  beam
energy was 3.6 J.

Since  this  value  is  essentially  identical  with  the  3.8  J  minimum  energy  for  the
plasmoid   the plasmoid energy appears to be transferred at high efficiency to the beams as
predicted by the theoretical model used here[16,17]. This has to be a qualified conclusion
since the plasmoid energy is a lower limit.

The  energy  of  the  electron  beam  can  also  be  measured,  although  less  directly,  as  a
check on the ion beam measurement.  The ~1.0 MeV gamma rays that form the initial pulse
observed  through  the  lead  shields  of  the  remote  detectors  clearly  are  generated  by  the
electron beam hitting the copper anode. Taking an electron energy of 1.3MeV, equal to that
measured  in  the  ion  beam,  it  takes  a  beam  energy  of  0.72  J  to  produce  the  observed  5.3
microjoule  gamma  ray  pulse,  observed  through  5  cm  lead,  6  cm  copper  (from  the  anode
and the cover of the detector) and the 9mm steel vacuum chamber wall. Since 0.3-0.5 J of
the initial electron beam energy is absorbed in heating the plasmoid particles, the initial e-
beam energy is 1.0-1.2 J, in adequate agreement with the 1.7 J measured for the ion beam.
At least 18% of the electron beam energy is transferred to the plasmoid electrons.

Total fusion energy released in shot 81602 is 11.7 mJ or 0.3% of total plasmoid energy
and 4% of particle thermal energy. Total x-ray energy released is 2.2mJ or 20% of fusion
yield.

Part  of  this  same  analysis  can  be  done  for  shot  80910,  which,  however  lacks  x-ray
data. Here minimum magnetic energy is 19J, minimum particle energy is 3.6 J, ion beam
energy is 4.4 J, electron beam energy is 3.0J.  The agreement between total e-beam energy,
taken as 6.6J and ion beam energy is again adequate.   But the total plasmoid energy is in
only marginal agreement with total beam energy, being about a factor of 2 larger.  At least
38%  of  electron  beam  energy  is  converted  to  particle  energy.   Fusion  energy  of  58mJ  is
0.3% of plasmoid energy and 1.6% of particle energy.

It  is  notable  that  in  both  shots,  the  beam  energy  is  closely  comparable  to  the  total
plasmoid energy and that in both cases beam energy exceeds plasmoid particle energy, in
accord with the model's assumption that the beams heat the particles.   This would not be
the case, however, if Ti were in fact considerably less than the Ti calculated from TOF data,
or if a large cool electron component were present. In either of these cases, particle energy
would  considerably  exceed  beam  energy.   So  the  agreement  shown  here  is  another
indication that the TOF calculation is reliable and no cold component is present.

Clearly  the  efficiency  of  energy  transfer  into  the  plasmoid  is  not  high,  since  by  the
time of the pinch the capacitor bank has transferred 41kJ into the device. (This is measured
by  the  voltage  probe  and  primary  Rogowski  coil).  So  only  0.01-0.05%  of  total  energy
available is fed into the plasmoid in this shot. Ways to increase this efficiency are discussed
in Sec. 6.

Overall  energy  efficiency  should  be  viewed  in  the  context  of  other  fusion  devices.
Total bank energy is 120kJ, so "wall plug" efficiency is 4.8x10-7 for shot 80910, but for the
highest neutron yield (3x1011) with any electrodes and the same input energy, efficiency  is
2.4x10-6.  For  comparison,  the  best  D-D  yield  with  TFTR  is  11.7kJ  and  the  total  power
supply energy for one pulse is 3GJ, producing a wall plug efficiency of 3.9x10-6[4].

4. DISCUSSION AND COMPARISONS WITH EARLIER RESULTS

Given the significance of the results, it is important to examine carefully whether there
is an alternative explanation. In particular, is it at all possible that the high energy electrons
and ions are in a more diffuse plasma than the dense plasmoid which clearly produces the
DT neutrons?

This  alternative  hypothesis  necessitates  that  some  fraction  of  the  DD  neutrons  are
produced  by  the  diffuse  plasma,  the  rest  by  the  dense  plasmoid  that  also  produces  DT
neutrons. If, say, 0.5 of the neutrons are produced by the plasmoid and 0.5 by the diffuse
15

plasma, then the plasmoid can also contain only half the tritium, and n must then be twice
the value calculated above, or 3.2x1021/ cm3. Assuming that the plasmoid exists only long
enough to produce the DT neutron pulse, or 10 ns, nτ would then be 3.2x1013, a factor of 3
less than that calculated above.

If, in this alternative we assume that the other half of the neutrons are produced in a
more extended plasma that also produces the hard x-rays, we can extend the cooling time
of the hot electrons to 25 ns if ni= 2.2x1019/ cm3. We can avoid heating the cool component
above 10keV by limiting the hot electrons to nh= 1.5x1018/ cm3.   To produce the observed
quantity of hard x-rays, we then have an extended plasma volume of 6.6x10-4 cm3, 1015 hot
electrons and total hot electron energy of 23 J. In the same volume, if we were to assume Ti
==55keV,  we  would  produce  38  times  more  neutrons  than  observed.  So  we  have  to  also
assume that the 55keV TOF energy is a bulk motion of trapped plasma and thermal energy
per ion is only 8keV.   Total particle energy will then be at least 150 J and total magnetic
field  plus  particle  energy  at  least  300  J,  since  the  magnet  energy  of  the  containing  field
must at least equal total particle energy.

Two things are obvious about this alternative model. First, it is highly artificial with
ad-hoc assumptions about density and particle energy required to conform to observation,
generally a sign of an incorrect model. Second, the energy involved is 100 times more than
the energy in the beams. So in this model, the beams could not possible be the source of
energy for the ions and electrons despite the fact that the beams are closely synchronous
with the x-ray and neutron emissions. In contrast the model used in this paper explains all
the observed phenomena with no ad-hoc assumptions. It is thus a much better explanation
of the data.

The  plasmoid-based  model  used  here  makes  quantitative  predictions  that  are
confirmed  by  the  data,  giving  another  reason  for  confidence  in  this  interpretation.  As
described in previous papers[5,16,17]) the plasmoid begins to generate the beams when the
synchrotron radiation from the highest-field region at the core of the plasmoid can escape
the plasma. This sudden loss of energy from a localized spot at the center of the plasmoid
causes a drop in the current and in the magnetic field, generating a strong electric field that
accelerates the ion and electron beam.  The synchrotron radiation can begin to escape when
the gyrofrequency just exceeds 2ωp,where ωp is the plasma frequency.   For shot 81602 the
ratio of peak gyrofrequency to peak plasma frequency is 2.2, an excellent agreement with
prediction.

It is important to note that the results presented here are consistent in many ways with
earlier work. In particular the density of hot spots in the 1021/ cm3 range has been reported
by many authors[11,12,13,25,26] measuring density by diverse means, including the ones
used here--the ratio of DT to DD neutrons. Brzosko and Nardi reported[25] nτ of 1.6x1013
s/cm3,  very  close  to  our  average  results  of  1.6x1013  s/cm3.  The  same  team  measured
densities  as  high  as  5x1021  /cm3, somewhat above the best levels reached here. Magnetic
fields of the order of the 400 MG reported here, up to 200 MG, have also been reported and
measured previously[5].

What is new in these results is the high reported Tei and Ti. Others have reported Te of
7keV[27] and Ti of 18keV[28], much lower than the values reported here.   There are two
main reasons for this difference. The first concerns the conditions in this experiment.   The
fill  pressure  was  deliberately  increased  by  decreasing  the  electrode  length,  which  I
anticipated on theoretical grounds [16,17] would increase n, thereby increase the coupling
between the electron beam and the plasma electrons.  This in turn would increase Te and Ti.
The validity of this correlation of fill pressure with  Te is demonstrated in a set of shots run
with a longer (30 cm) electrode at 9 torr.   Using the same x-ray technique, average Te  of
34 keV was found, a factor of 5 less than the average Te of 175keV found at 13 torr using
the  shorter  electrode.  (In  these  shots,  the  radiation  from  the  anode  was  not  blocked,  but
there was  a clear distinction in time between the first,  gamma-ray, pulse and the second,
hard  x-ray,  pulse.   If  there  was  a  gamma-ray  contribution  to  the  second  pulse,  it  would

Prospects for P11B Fusion with the Dense Plasma Focus: New Results

increase  the  apparent  temperature.  In  this  case,  the  drop  in  Te  at  the  lower  fill  pressure
would be even more pronounced than described here.)

By comparison, none of the experiments found in the literature that measured Te or Ti
ran  with  fill  pressures  as  high  as  13  torr.   The  measurement  of  Te   of  7kev  at  1  torr  fill
pressure,  and  Ti  of  18keV  measurement  at  8  torr  is  comparable  with  the  present  Te
measurement of 34keV at 9 torr.

In addition, almost all experiments failed to distinguish physically between the anode
gamma ray emission and the hard x-ray emission from the plasmoids.   This in some case
led  to  erroneous  conclusions  that  the  MeV  electrons  were  trapped  in  the  plasmoids  and
thus, at these high energies could co-exist with a cooler background. As well, the approach
of  many  groups  to  ignore  the  importance  of  the  plasmoid  and  assume  a  relatively
homogenous plasma within the pinch led to problems in interpreting data and the rejection
of high Te and Ti, since these could not be representative of the entire pinch column.

5. MAGNETIC FIELD EFFECT

The  high  particle  energies  achieved  in  these  shots  already  match  those  needed  for
hydrogen- boron fusion.   For the He shots, the atomic mass is close to the average atomic
mass of p11B, so it is reasonable to expect that these conditions can be matched with p11B.
However,  while  the  experiments  described  above  show  clearly  that  the  high  particle
energies  required  of  proton  boron  fusion  are  attainable,  there  is  another  well-known
challenge in achieving net energy from this fuel.  Because of the z2 dependence and boron's
z of 5, bremsstrahlung x-ray radiation is enhanced and many analyses have indicated that
fusion  poorer  can  barely  if  at  all  exceed  plasma  cooling  by  bremsstrahlung[29].   If
unavoidable,  this  situation  would  eliminate  the  heating  of  the  plasma  by  the  fusion
produced alpha particles and would require that all the energy be recovered from the x-ray
radiation.

However  published  analyses  have  overlooked  an  important  physical  effect  that  is
especially relevant for the DPF. This effect, first pointed out by McNally[30], involves the
reduction  of  energy  transfer  from  the  ions  to  the  electrons  in  the  presence  of  a  strong
magnetic  field.  This  in  turn  reduce  the  electron  temperature  and  thus  the  bremsstrahlung
emission.

For ions colliding with electrons with gyrofrequency ωg, energy transfer drops rapidly
for impact parameters b> vi/ ωg, where vi   is ion velocity, since in that case the electron is
accelerated at some times during the collision and decelerated at others, so average energy
transfer is small.  This means that the bmax is less than the Debye length, λD   by a factor of
vi ωp/ vet ωg, where ωp is the plasma frequency and vet is the electron thermal velocity. So
the Coulomb logarithm in the standard energy-loss formula  is reduced to Ln (mvi

2/_ ωg).

This formula   is approximately valid for collisions in which ions collide with slower
moving  electrons,  which  are  the  only  collisions  in  which  the  ions  lose  energy.   But  for
collisions of faster moving electrons with ions, where the electrons lose energy to the ions,
2/_ωg)
the Coulombs logarithm, by the same logic, is Ln(mvet
can be much larger than Ln(mvi
  in other words
for sufficiently large B. Ignoring momentum transfer parallel to field, steady state occurs
when Ti/Te = Ln(mve

2/_ωg) for sufficiently large values of _ωg,, 

2/_ωg).  If vet>> vi then Ln(mve

2/_ωg)/Ln(mvi

2/_ωg)[30].

This  effect  has  been  studied  in  a  few  cases  for  fusion  plasmas  with  relatively  weak
fields, where is shown to be a relatively small effect[31].   It has been studied much more
extensively in the case of neutron starts[32],[33]. However, it has never been applied to the
DPF plasmoids, whose force-free configuration and very strong magnetic fields make the
effect far more important.  First, small-angle momentum transfer parallel to the field can be
neglected  in  these  plasmoids,  since  the  ion  velocity  lies  very  close  to  the  local  magnetic
field direction, and Δppar/Δpperp  ~sin2θ, where  θ is the angle between the ion velocity and

17

Eric J. Lerner

the B field direction[32 ].

In a force-free configuration, such as the toroidal vortices that make up the plasmoids,

ions disturbed by collisions return to the local field lines in times of order 1/ωgi, so

θ ~  ωci/ωgi,

Where   ωci is the ion collision frequency. For a decaborane plasma, θ~2x10-8n/Ti
3/2B.
For  the  example  of  the  plasmoid  conditions  calculated  above,  n=3x1021,  B  =400MG,
θ=0.01 for Ti=60keV.   In all plasmoids of interest in the DPF, θ is very small and small-
angle parallel momentum transfer is thus also very small.

Even  more  significantly,  the  high  B   in  plasmoid  generates  a  regime  where  mvi

2/
_ωg<1. In this case the magnetic effect is very large, the above formulae break down and
quantum effects have to be considered. Such a situation has never been studied before for
fusion applications, but has been analyzed extensively in the case of protons falling onto
neutron stars[32].

In  a  strong  magnetic  field,  since  angular  momentum  is  quantized  in  units  of  _,
electrons  can  have  only  discrete  energy  levels,  termed  Landau  levels  (ignoring  motion
parallel to the magnetic field):

Eb = (n+1/2) e_B/mc =(n+1/2) 11.6eVB(GG).

Viewed  another  way,  electrons  cannot  have  gyroradii  smaller  than  their  DeBroglie
wavelength.  Since  maximum  momentum  transfer  is mv,  where  v  is  relative  velocity,  for
mv2/2<  Eb  almost  no  excitation  of  electrons  to  the  next  Landau  level  can  occur,  so  very
little  energy  can  be  transferred  to  the  electrons  in  such  collisions.  Again  ignoring  the
electron's own motion along the field lines, thus condition occurs when

Ei<(M/m) Eb

For Ei =300keV, this implies B>14GG for p, B>3.5GG for α , and B>1.3GG for  11B.

As will be shown below, such field strengths should be attainable with the DPF.

If we assume that Teth>> Eb, then we have to consider the motion of the electrons along
the field lines, which can increase the relative velocity of collision, v.  In the classical case,
the ions will lose energy only from electrons for which vepar<vi. Since for these collisions
v<2vi,  energy  loss  will  still  be  very  small  if  Ei<1/2(M/m) Eb,  which  can  occur  for  boron
nuclei.

However,  there  is  a  phenomena  which  prevents  energy  loss  to  the  electrons  from
falling to negligble levels. (This were not considered in the presentation actually given at
the symposium so the conclusions here differ somewhat from those presented then.)

In the classical case, considering only motion along the line of force, an ion colliding
with a faster moving electron will lose energy if the electrons' velocity is opposite to the of
the ion, but will gain energy if they are in the same direction--the electron overtaking the
ion.  In  the  latter  case  the  relative  velocity  is  less  than  in  the  former  case,  and  since  the
energy transfer increases with decreasing relative velocity, there is a net gain of energy to
the ion. For an ion moving faster than the electron, the ion overtakes the electrons, and thus
loses energy independently of the direction that   the electron is moving in. Thus ions only
lose energy to electrons moving more slowly than they are.

However  in  the  situation  considered  here,  ions  in  some  cases  can  lose  energy  to
electrons that are moving faster than the ions.   Consider the case of ions moving along the
filed  lines  colliding  with  electrons  in  the  ground  Landau  level.  If  vepar  is  such  that
m(vi+vepar)2>2  Eb,  while  m(vi-vepar)2<2Eb,  the  energy  lost  by  the  ion  in  collision  with
opposite-directed electrons will much exceed that gained in same-directed collisions, since
in the first case the electron can be excited to a higher Landau level, but not in the second

Prospects for P11B Fusion with the Dense Plasma Focus: New Results

case. In neither case can the electron give up to the ion energy from perpendicular motion,
as  it  is  in  the  ground  sate.  (So,  this  consideration  does  not  apply  to  above-ground-state
electrons, which will lose energy to slower-moving ions.)

If Teth>> Eb, and we assume a Maxwellian distribution, the number of electrons in the
ground  state  will  be  proportional  to  the  volume  in  velocity-space.  The  number  of  such
electrons in the ground state will be ~πviEb, while the number of electrons moving slower
than vi in a non-magnetic Maxwellian distribution will be ~(8/3)πviEi(m/M), so there will
be  a  factor  of  (3/8)  Ei  /Ei  (m/M)  increasing  the  effective  collision  rate,  comparing  the
magnetic with non-magnetic case, for Ei< Eb.

At the same time, the rate of energy loss to each electron will be much less at relative
velocities of order vb=(2Eb/m)1/2, as compared to relative velocities of order vi in the non-
magnetic  case.  This  reduces  the  energy  loss  for  the  magnetic  case  by  a  factor  of
Ei(m/M)/Eb.   Combining these two factors, it is clear that the Coulomb logarithm term in
the magnetic case tends to a constant value, independent of Ei for Ei < Eb.

The calculation of the exact value of lnΛ for a given Maxwellian distribution of ions
with  dimensionless  temperature  T=Ti/Eb(M/m),  begins  with  a  quantum  mechanical
calculation  of  lnΛ'  for  an  ion  moving  along  the  field  line  colliding  with  an  electron
assumed to be at rest. This result was calculated by Nelson, Saltpeter and Wasserman [32].
From their work,

lnΛ'(v) = (1/2)v(1/(2 v  2)- e2v2

Γ(0,2v2))

Where v  is  the  dimensionless  ion  velocity  vi/vb,  and  v<1.   For v>1,  the  same  source

gives as a good approximation

lnΛ'(v) =ln(2v  2)

To determine the effective lnΛ''(v) for an ion of velocity v   colliding with ground state
electrons with temperature Teth>> Eb, we can use these formulae, substituting in   v' as the
relative velocity. First consider the case where v<1 and v'<1.   There are equal number of
electrons moving with positive or negative velocity relative to v, so we integrate assuming
both v'=v+ve and v'=v-ve,  where  ve  is  ve/vb. For v>ve,  both  cases  contribute  to  ion  energy
loss, while for v<ve,  the  v+ve case adds to ion energy loss, while the v-ve cases subtracts.
Taking into account the 1/v  2dependence of energy loss rates, we have the contribution to
lnΛ''(v) from v'<1 collisions is

v

3/8 v-1(∫0

(v -2) lnΛ'(v-ve) dve +∫0

 

1-v

(v -2) lnΛ'(v+ve) dve
 

-∫v

1+v

 

(v -2) lnΛ'(ve-v) dve)

Numerical  integration  shows  that  this  integral  is  0  for  all  v'<1.   While  individual
collisions can add or subtract energy, collectively there is no net energy transfer when the
relative  velocity  is  too  low  to  excite  the  electron  out  of  the  ground  state,  as  would  be
naively expected.

19

Eric J. Lerner

This  leaves  the  cases  where  v'>1.   If v+ve  >1+2v, then ve-v  >1  as  well,  and  in  these
cases    since ve>v (still considering v <1) the ions gain energy on net. So additional energy
loss  can  only  come  when  1<  v+ve  <1+2v.  So  the  additional  term  (which  contributes  the
whole of lnΛ''(v)) is

1+2v

lnΛ''(v) =3/8v-1∫1

ln(2v'2)v'2dv'=3/8v-1

 ((2+ln2/2)(1-1/1+2v) -ln(1+2v)/1+2v))

This expression is close to 3/8 for 0.2<v<0.5 and decreases to 3/8ln2 as v approaches 0

and to ~(3/8) x 0.83 for v =1.

For v>1, another term is needed to account for the case where v>ve and ve-v >1, where
energy is again lost to the electrons. In addition, for v>(3/2)1/2, energy can be lost to non-
ground-state  electrons  as  well,  and lnΛ''(v)  rapidly converges on ((v-1)/v)ln(2v2).  We  can
use this value for v>1.35.

Finally, integration over a Maxwellian distribution of v yields the effective Coulomb
logarithm as a function of T, the dimensionless ion temperature. (As a first approximation,
the  use  of  Maxwellian  distributions  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  the  ion-ion  and  electron-
electron energy transfer rates considerably exceed the ion-electron rates. However, the ion
velocity distribution will be distorted by the alpha-particle heating.)

For the heating of the ions by the much faster thermal electrons, with Te>>1, quantum

effects can be ignored and the coulomb logarithm is simply Ln(2Te).

5.1 CALCULATION OF ELECTRON TEMPERATURE,
BREMSSTRAHLUNG

Obtaining  the  Coulomb  logarithm  allows  the  calculation  of  energy  balances  for  any
combination  of  T,  nτ,  and  B.   To  illustrate  the  magnitude  of  the  magnetic  effect  and  to
demonstrate that fusion power can well exceed bremsstrahlung loses, I calculated a number
of  examples,  using  the  theoretical  model  of  the  plasma  focus  described  in  section  6.  In
these  examples  Ti,  the  ion  temperature  is  assumed  to  be  300keV,  the  B  and  nτ,  are
calculated  based  on  the  formulae  in  section  6.  In  these  calculations  Te  is  determined  by
finding the value at which no net energy is flowing to the electrons.   In this case the net
energy  loss  through  the  heating  of  the  protons  and  11B  and  through  bremsstrahlung
radiation is balanced by the heating of the electrons by fusion-generated alpha particles and
the heating by the electron beam, whose energy is assumed to be wholly absorbed. The fuel
is assumed to be pure decaborane(B10H14).

The examples chosen are for very small electrodes with a cathode radius of only 1.25
cm.   However, very similar results are obtained with electrodes with a cathode radii of 5
cm  and peak currents just double those given in table 3 (magnetic fields half as big but the
same nτ).

Note  that  the  effect  is  sensitively  depend  on  nτ,  since  as  n  decreases  collisional
processes  become  less  important  relative  to  beam  heating.   For  comparison,  if  magnetic
effects are entirely neglected, at 1.5 MA Te is 113keV and Fusion/ bremsstrahlung power is
.97. In contrast, with the correct accounting for magnetic field effects fusion energy release
is well above bremsstrahlung, leading to rapid heating of the ions.

This  calculation  is  of  course  only  a  preliminary  one  for  a  specific  static  case.  A
dynamic model that follows a plasmoid as it heats up and as helium ash is accumulated will
be a logical next step in this analysis. But the analysis presented here clearly shows that net
energy production is possible with decaborane at high magnetic fields.
6. CAN THESE CONDITIONS BE ACHIEVED WITH THE DPF?

Previously-developed  theory  can  show  how  these  conditions  can  be  achieved  with  a

21

Eric J. Lerner

DPF. As described in [16,17] the DPF process can be described quantitatively using only a
few basic assumptions.  First, we assume that the magnetic energy of the field is conserved
during  the  formation  of  the  plasmoid,  and  that  in  a  well-formed  pinch,  all  the  energy
present  in  the  field  at  the  time  of  the  pinch  is  trapped  in  the  plasmoid.  Given  that
experimentally,  it  has  been  determined  that  the  length  of  the  central  channel  in  the
plasmoid is close to 8 times its radius, we have:

where Ic is current(A) in the plasmoid, rc is the radius(cm) of the central plasmoid channel,
I is current at time of pinch and r is the cathode radius. (The cathode is the outer electrode.)

Second, following[16], plasma instability theory shows that for optimal filament

formation, in the plasma chamber,

where ωce is electron gyrofrequency and ωpi   is ion plasma frequency.   This immediately
allows us to predict the optimal pressures given r and I, the plasma velocity, and thus the
electrode length for a given pulse length.

where ni is initial ion density , µ is atomic mass, V is the peak sheath velocity at the anode,
R is the anode radius, m is electron mass and M is proton mass.

Third, instability theory can also be used, as in [16]. to show that in the filaments

where ωcef is the electron gyrofrequency in the filament and   ωpep is the electron plasma
frequency in the background plasma.

We can then find that the incoming filament system, and thus the DPF as a whole has

an effective resistance of

so  that  the  peak  I  for  a  given  V  can  be  determined.   It  should  be  noted  that  this  is  a
maximum  value,  and  that  it  can  only  be  obtained  if  the  inductance  of  the  pulsed  power
supply plus DPF is sufficiently low.

Fourth, we know that at the time the plasmoid begins to decay,

This  is  due  to  the  condition  that  when  the  synchrotron  frequency  exceeds  twice  the
plasma frequency, energy can be radiated. At this point, the current begins to drop, and the
change  in   the  magnetic  field  sets  up  large  accelerating  potentials  to  sustain  the  current.
This  in  turn  generates  the  ion  and  electron  beams  that  release  the  energy  trapped  in   the
plasmoid and initiate its decay, as well as start nuclear reactions.

Finally, we assume that during compression the ratio B/n is a constant, as explained in

[16].

From  these  basic  physical  relations,  it  is  simple  algebra  to  derive  the  plasma
parameters in the plasmoid, not only for hydrogen, as in [16], but for any gas or mixture of
gases[17]. The results are summarized here:

3) rc = 2-7/3µ-2/3z-2/3M/m-2/3r = 1.32x10-3µ-2/3z-2/3r
4) Bc=4z(µM/m)B
5) nc=3.7x1010µ2zI2/r2

where  Bc  is  peak  field  at  cathode.  The  model  in  [16]  also  allows  us  to  describe  the
production of the electron and ion beams and the duration of the plasmoid.  This is possible
simply  by  equating  the  energy  lost  though  the  beams  with  the  decay  of  the  plasmoid  B
field, allowing a calculation of the accelerating potential, beam current and decay time.

6) τ = 6.2x10-6rc/RB = 8.2x10-9µ-2/3z-2/3r/RB

7) nτ= 304µ4/3z1/3I2/rRB

8) Eb=IcRBe/4π2=.24µ1/3z1/3IRB

9) Ib  =  .24µ1/3z1/3I

Here,  τ   is  plasmoid  decay  time,  RB  is  the  effective  resistance  of  the  beam,  nc  is
plasmoid density, Eb is average beam energy per electronic charge and  Ib is beam current.
However,  a  modification  must  be  imposed  here.   For  low  I  and  thus  low  accelerating
potentials,  all  the  particles  in   the  plasmoid  are  evacuated  through  the  beam  without
carrying all the energy away.   In this case the simple model will break down near the end
of  the  plasmoid  decay.  However,  for  present  purposes  a  suitable  approximation  simply
reduces the plasma lifetime by the ratio of the accelerating potential to that needed to carry
the entire plasmoid energy. To a good approximation this factor turns out to be I/1.4MA.
For I>1.4MA, this factor is unity.

The  particle  density  increases  with  µ  and  z  as  well  as  with  I,  and  decreases  with
increasing r.   Physically this is a direct result of the greater compression ratio that occurs
with heavier gases, as is clear from the above relations.  We thus see that the crucial plasma
parameter  nτ  improves  with  heavier  gases.   Indeed,  this  is  a  faster  improvement  than
appears at first, since it can be shown that RB also decreases as µ-3/4. Assuming z and µ to
be proportional, nτ thus increases as µ2.4.

These  theoretical  precautions  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  results  discussed  in
sections 1-4. . If we use (4) to predict Bc we obtain 0.43 GG, in excellent agreement with
the observed value of 0.4 GG.  Similarly, (7) yields 4.6x1013 sec/cm3   as compared with the
best observed value of 9x1013 and the average of 0.9x1013.

For  decaborane  with  z=2.66  and  u  =5.166,  with  r=  1.25cm  and  I=  1.5  MA,  the
formulae above yield Bc =24GG and nτ=6x1015, while r= 5 cm, I =3MA yield B =12GG
and nt =6x1015.   This is of course a considerable extrapolation-- a factor of 60 above our
observed value in both B and nτ.  However, these conditions can be reached with relatively
small plasma focus devices.

These  results  show  the  potential  of  the  DPF  as  a  possible  device  for  advanced  fuel

fusion.   Further work will be required to increase the efficiency of energy transfer into the
plasmoid, which is low in these shots.   Such high efficiency has been achieved with other
DPF experiments[33,34,35,36], but not with the high density or particle energy achieved in
these experiments.   However, optimization of electrode design, which we were not able to
accomplish in this experiment, may solve this problem.  Our results show that neutron yield
increases rapidly with increased sheath run-down velocity, in accord with other published
results[37].This is confirmed by several other experiments[33,34,35,36].  The efficiency of
energy transfer from the magnetic field into the plasmoid can be measured by comparing
total  beam  energy  with  magnetic  field  energy  at  time  of   peak  current.  In  a  number  of
experiments where this efficiency is in the  range of 10-20%, the Alfven velocity, VA at the
anode at peak current is 18-23 cm/µs.   In contrast, in our experiments, VA is 7.9cm/µs for
D and 7.1 cm/µs for  4He and efficiency is only 0.01%.   Therefore, a smaller anode radius,
which will increase the B field and run-down velocity, could increase efficiency to much
higher levels.   A combination of high fill pressure, small anode radius, and high rundown
velocity should be able to simultaneously achieve high efficiency of energy transfer as well
as the high density and particle energy needed for advanced fuel fusion. VA in the region of
30 cm/µs for D is in the likely range of parameters needed for high efficiency and high Te,
Ti and n.   The theoretical model indicates that VA of about 15 cm/µs will be required for
p11B,  but further experimental work will be needed to confirm this.

Abstract Based on the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein’s equation of gravitational field, it is proved 
that light’s speed would change and isotropy of light’s speed would be violated in gravitational field with 

spherical symmetry. On the earth’s surface, light’s speed vertical to the surface is 

0.2m/s

  less than that 

parallel to the surface. It is suggested to use the method of the Michelson—Morley interference to verify 

the  change  of  light’s  speed  and  the  violation  of  isotropy  in  the  gravitational  field  of  the  earth.  In  the 

proposed experiment, one arm of interferometer is vertical to the earth’s surface while another is parallel to 

the  earth’s  surface.  When  two  arms  are  turned  over 

090

,  the  shift  of  about 

0.07

  interference  stripe 

would  be  caused  which  can  be  observed  directly.  So  this  experiment  can  be  considered  as  a  new 

verification for general relativity in the gravitational field with spherical symmetry. If the experiment shows 

that gravitation would change light’ speed and violate the isotropy of light’s speed, the result would cause 

great effects on foundational physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

Key Words General Relativity, Schwarzschild Solution, Light’s Speed, Michelson—Morley Interference 

In light of special relativity, light’s speed is a constant with isotropy in vacuum without the existence 

of gravitation or interaction. But it is still an uncertain problem in the current theory whether or not light’s 

speed  would  change  in  gravitational  field.  Because  there  is  interaction  between  photon  and  material  in 

gravitational field, photon would not be free one. It is a rational speculation that light’s speed would change 

in gravitational field. As shown below, we prove this point based on the Einstein’s theory of gravitation. On 

the other hand, according to the common understanding of general relativity, we have both definitions of 

the coordinate time and the proper time, as well as the coordinate length and the proper length. Proper time 

and proper length are also called as stander clock and stander ruler. Because coordinate time and coordinate 

length are variable in the different space-time points in gravitational field, it is meaningless for us to use 

them do any measurement. When we measure time, space and object’s motions in gravitational field, what 

can be used are only stander clock and stander ruler according to the current theory. It has been proved that 

in a static gravitational field, when stander clock and stander ruler are used, light’s speed, equal to its speed 

in  vacuum,  is  still  a  constant

.  Therefore  at  present,  in  the  concrete  calculations  of  astrophysical  and 

( )1

cosmological problems, as well as in the theoretical explanations of astronomical observations, we always 

take light’s speed as a constant. 

However, these two kinds of judgments on light’s speed in gravitational field are contradictory each 

other.  Which  one  is  real?  To  resolve  this  problem,  let  us  concretely  discuss  light’s  speed  in  a  static

gravitational field with spherical symmetry, and propose an experiment to judge them. The Schwarzschild 

metric of the Einstein’s equation of static gravitational field with spherical symmetry is

It  is  obvious  that 

V

  is  not  only  relative  to  the  mass  of  center  material,  but  also  relative  to  the  angular 

momentum of photon. It can be seen from (8) and (9) that light’s accelerations are not equal to zeros, no 

matter what proper time or coordinate time is used. So light’s speed can not be a constant in gravitational 

field.  Meanwhile,  because  it  is  relative  to  angular  momentum,  light’s  speed  is  also  anisotropic  in 

gravitational field.   

It  should  be  noted  that  τd   is  the  proper  time  indicated  by  the  clock  fixed  on  the  moving  reference 
  is the coordinate time indicated by the clock located on the static reference frame. When 

frame, and 

dt

formula (1) is used to describe the earth’s gravitational field, 

dt

  and 

dr

  in (9) are actually the time and 

length which are measured by the observers at rest on the earth. So in light of (12), for observers who are at 

rest on the earth’s surface, light’s speed is not a constant and not be isotropic again. On the other hand, as 

we known that only on the locally inertial reference frame, we can define stander ruler (proper length) and 

stander  clock  (proper  time).  The  locally  inertial  reference  frame  is  considered  to  be  one  falling  freely  in

gravitational  field,  in  which  the  Schwarzschild  metric  becomes  that  of  flat  space-time  with  the  form

light’s  speed  would  be  a  constant  being  equal  to  its  speed  in  vacuum.  But  for  observers  at  rest  in  the

gravitational field of the earth which is not a locally inertial reference frame, light’s speed could not be a 

constant, because no stander ruler and stander clock can be defined according to the current understanding.   

In fact, in general relativity, when we calculate the perihelion precession of the Mercury, the deviation 

of  light  and  the  delay  of  radar  wave  in  the  solar  gravitational  field,  we  actually  use  coordinate  time  and 

coordinate length, in stead of proper time and proper length. The calculating results of the deviation of light 

and the delay of radar wave in the gravitational field of the sun are

general relativity is supported by experiments. However, we should be clear in mind that formula (13) is 

based on the static reference frame of the sun, in which coordinate time and coordinate length are used. We 

have  not  transformed  them  into  proper  time  and  proper  length.  Meanwhile,  it  should  be  noticed  that  all 

experiments and observations are carried out on the earth reference frame, in stead of that on the sun. Only 

because relative velocity between them is small, the effect of special relativity is neglected. 

Therefore, for the same problem about light’s motion in gravitational field, we can also verify the effect

Michelson—Morley interference is used for this purpose. When light moves along the vertical direction of

.  The  light’s  vertical  speed  is  less  than  its  parallel  speed  on  the  earth’s 

surface. Thought the change of light’s speed and the violation of isotropy are very small, we can still verify 

their  existence  by  using  the  method  of  the  Michelson—Morley  interference.  Suppose  that  the  Michelson

Because  the  shift  of 

  stripe  can  be  observed  for  the  precise  Michelson  interferometer

,  this  is  a

directly observable result. If the shift of interference stripe can be found, it would mean that light’s speed 

changes and its isotropy is violated in the gravitational field of the earth. At present, all experiments of the 

Michelson—Morley interference used to prove light’s speed invariable are carried out on the earth’s surface. 

In  this  situation,  the  interferometer’s  two  arms  are  parallel  to  the  earth’s  surface  without  the  difference 

gravitational  potential,  so  the  change  of  light’s  speed  can  not  be  found.  If  the  difference  of  gravitational 

potential exists in the experiments, it may be possible for us to observer the shift of interference stripe. 
  Discussion  Because  the  formula  (12)  is  deduced  from  the  Schwarzschild  solution  of  the  Einstein’s 
equation of gravitational field, the experiment can be regarded as a new verification for general relativity in 

the weak gravitational field. It should be emphasized that all three results shown in formulas (13) and (22) 

are deduced from the formula (4). Now that the effects shown in (13) have been verified to exist, the effect 

shown in (22) would also exist. Thought the change of light’s speed in the earth’s gravitational field is very 

small, it would be great in strong field. For example, we have 

sun. So for the sun, we would have

  and  frequency 

0→ν

.  The  results  are 

completely different. At present, light’s speed is always regarded as a constant in the concrete calculations 

of  astrophysical  and  cosmological  problems,  as  well  as  in  the  theoretical  explanations  of  astronomical 

observations.  If  the  experiment  shows  that  light’s  speed  would  change  in  gravitational  field,  the  result 

would produce great effects on foundational physics, astrophysics and cosmology.

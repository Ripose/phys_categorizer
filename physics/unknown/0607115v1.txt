Abstract.  An  investigation  of  dust-acoustic  solitary  waves  in  unmagnetized  dusty  plasma  whose 
constituents are  inertial  charged  dust  grains,  Boltzmannian  electrons  and  nonthermal  ions  has  been 
conducted. The pseudo potential as well as the reductive perturbation methods have been used in high 
and small amplitude limits. The existence of solitary waves of a positive as well as a negative potential 
is reported. 
 

Keywords: Solitons, Sagdeev pseudo-potential, Dusty plasmas. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

In  recent  years,  there  has  been  a  great  deal  of  interest  in  understanding  different  types  of 

collective  processes  in  dusty  plasmas,  which  are  very  common  in  laboratory  and  astrophysical 

environments  [1-4].  It  has  been  found  that  the  presence  of  charged  dust  grains  modifies  the 

existing  plasma  wave  spectra,  whereas  the  dust  dynamics  may  even  introduce new  eigenmodes 

in  the  plasma.  Indeed,  Rao  et  al.  [5],  were  the  first  to  predict  theoretically  the  existence  of 

extremely 

low-phase  velocity  dust  acoustic  waves  in  unmagnetized  dusty  plasmas  whose 

constituents  are  inertial  charged  dust  grains  and  Boltzmann  distributed  ions  and  electrons. 

These  waves  have  been  reported  experimentally  and  their  nonlinear  features  investigated  by 

Barkan  et  al.  [6].  In  this  work,  we  consider  the  ions  non-thermal  [7,  8] and study their effect on 

the properties of dust acoustic waves. 

MODEL EQUATIONS 

We consider  a  three-component  dusty  plasma  with  extremely  massive,  micron-sized, 

negatively charged dust grains,  Boltzmannian electrons and nonthermally distributed ions.  The 

quasi- neutrality at equilibrium is written as,

  compressive  and  rarefactive  solitons  coexist.    It  has  to  be  mentioned,  that 

solitons  correspond  to  very  small  hump  by  opposition  to  cavitons.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  for 
55.1=M

  (Fig.5)  the  ratio  of  the  depth  of  the  caviton  to  the  soliton  amplitude  is  around  ~10 . 

Figures  6  and  7  depict  the  variation  of  Sagdeev  potential  for  a  fixed  values  of  the  Mach 

number M   and  for  different  value  of  a and m.  It  is  found  that  solitons  and  cavitons  coexist 

when

SMALL AMPLITUDE LIMIT 

To  study  the  dynamics  of  small  amplitude  dust-acoustic  solitary  waves,  we  derive  the 

KdV  equation  from  our  basic  equations  (13)-(15),  by  employing  the  reductive  perturbation 

method.  We  expand  the  variables   

dn m,

d

  and    F

  around the unperturbed states in power series

Figures  8-14  show 

the  variation  of  soliton  and  caviton  profiles  for 

the  nonthermally 

distributed  ions  for  different  values  of  M ,  a ,  s and  m.  It  is  shown in  Figures  8  and  9 that 

while  the  soliton  amplitude  increases  with  the  increase  of  the  Mach  number,  its  width 

decrease  as  it  was  expected.  Figures  10  and  11  show  that as we increase  a , the amplitude of 

the  soliton  decreases  and  the  depth  of  the  caviton  increases,  whereas  the  width  of  the  soliton 

increases  and  the  caviton  width  decreases.  Moreover,  Figures  12-13  show  that  the  width  of 

the  soliton  decreases  with  the  increase  ofm,  while  the  amplitude  increases.  Besides, the  depth 

of 

the  caviton 

increases  with 

increasing 

the  value  ofm,  whereas  its  width  decreases. 

Moreover,  it  is  seen  from  Figure  14  that  the  width  of  soliton  decreases  when  s decreases, 

while its amplitude increases. 

CONCLUSION 

In  summary,  let  us  recall  that  for  Boltzmannian  ions  the  soliton  solutions  exist  for 

95.0

< M

<

52.1

,  and  that  solitons  are  exclusively  rarefactive  (cavitons)  (c.f.  Ref.[9]).  The 

condition  on  the  Mach  number  may  be  modified  if  ions  are  nonthermally  distributed.  Indeed, 
< M

the  allowed  Mach  numbers  are  given  by, 

). Moreover, it 

  (in  case

01.0=

= sm

62.1

41.1

<

is  found  that  inclusion  of  such  a  distribution  allows  the  coexistence  of  solitons  and  cavitons. 

Indeed,  we  have 

investigated 

the  effect  of  non-thermal  ions  on  linear  and  non-linear 

propagation  of  dust  acoustic  waves  in  unmagnetized  dusty  plasma  consisting  of  cold  dust 

particles  with  Boltzmann  distributed  electrons  and  non-thermally  distributed 

ions.  It 

is 

revealed,  that  as  we  increasea ,  the  upper  limit  of  the  Mach  number  increases.  It  is  found 

from  our  study  that  solitonic  solutions exist  for

. Besides,  it  is  interesting  to  point  out 

41.1>M

that  dusty  plasmas  can  support  both  solitary  waves  of  positive  and  negative  potential 

corresponding  to  a  dip  (caviton)  and  a  hump  (soliton)  in  the  dust  density,  for
41.1‡M

).  It  is  also  found  that  when

  (and 

Furthermore,  a  study  of  solitary  waves  of  small  amplitude  has  been  conducted  in  the 

framework  of  the  reductive  perturbation  method.  It  is  revealed  that  the  dynamics  of  weakly 

nonlinear  and  weakly  dispersive  dust-acoustic  waves  is  governed  by  a  KdV  equation.  The 

stationary  solution  of  this  equation  can  be  represented  in  the  form  of  a  squared  secant   

hyperbolic.  We  may  mention  at  the  end, that  we came to know that  Mamun  et  al. also derived 

the  Sagdeev  quasi-potential  of  the  plasma  under  study,  which  is  fortunately  the  same  as  the 

one  of  Eq.(18);  according  to  their  analysis  the  presence  of  non  thermal  ions  is  favourable  to 
the  co-existence of compressive and rarefactive solitons, provided a

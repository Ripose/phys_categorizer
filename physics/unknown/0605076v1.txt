Abstract  -  We  investigate,  both  analytically  and  numerically,  a  set  of  static  metrics  with the 
property that the integral of (cid:214)gR is zero. In a quantum theory of gravity based upon the Einstein 
action, these configurations will be present in the ground state as vacuum fluctuations (together 
with the spacetime foam). They contain a core with positive scalar curvature, surrounded by a 
shell with R<0. When the radius of the core approaches the Schwarzschild radius from below, 
the external radius increases, too, and the difference between the volume of the configuration 
and that of flat space diverges. The addition of a cosmological term to the action changes the 
total mass of these configurations. The combined effect of mass change and of the large internal 
volume considerably amplifies (locally) the cosmological term.

Although a complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity has not yet been established [1], it is 
possible  to  investigate  some  features  of  its  ground  state.  We  shall  use  in  this  investigation  only 
standard, widely accepted elements, assuming that the dynamics of the gravitational field is defined 
by  the  Einstein  action  S[g]  =  -(1/8pG)(cid:1)(cid:214)gRd4x,  and  that  the  probability  amplitude  for  any  field 
configuration gmn(x) is given by the Feynman exponential exp{iS[g]/(cid:1)}. (Below we shall use units in 
which c=(cid:1)=1, but in this introduction we leave (cid:1) in the equations for clarity.) 
 
The  field  configurations  allowed  in  the  classical  theory  minimize  S  and  thus  satisfy  the  Einstein 
equations. Throughout this paper we shall always consider the case of empty spacetime (Tmn=0); in 
this  case,  the  solutions  of  Einstein  equations  are  either  flat  spacetime  gmn(x)=hmn,  or  gravitational 
waves,  for  which  Rmn(x)  and  R(x)  vanish  at  any  point,  and  so  does  the  lagrangian  density  L=-
(1/8pG)(cid:214)gR.  
 
In the quantum theory, the mean value of any physical quantity is obtained in principle through an 
average  over  all  configurations,  with  weighing  factor  eiS/(cid:1)
.  This  formal  prescription  is  notoriously 
difficult  to  implement  in  a  meaningful  and  consistent  way.  Implementation  proposals  include  for 
instance  the  Euclidean  lattice  Regge  calculus  [2]  and  the  “dynamical  triangulations”  [3].  The 
problems related with these techniques do not affect our present general analysis, however. 
 
The  quantum  amplitude  eiS/(cid:1)
  oscillates  rapidly  if  |S|>>(cid:1),  and  therefore  off-shell  configurations 
contribute  very  little  to  average  values.  A  famous  exception  are  the  “spacetime  foam”  vacuum 
fluctuations [4], which are strong but confined to Planck-scale lengths  »lP; their curvature is such 
that |S|»lP
 
There  is,  however,  another  way  to  satisfy  the  condition  |S|<(cid:1).  Consider  more  extensive  field 
configurations  which  give  opposite  contributions  to  the  action  integral  in  different  regions  of 
spacetime. These configurations have vanishing or very small total action, even though their local 
curvature  R  may  be  such  that  (1/8pG)(cid:1)(cid:214)g|R|d4x>(cid:1)  over  any  single  region.  A  cancellation  between 

2(cid:214)g|R|<(cid:1).

opposite  contributions  in  different  regions  of  spacetime  can  only  occur  because  the  gravitational 
action, unlike most other fundamental field actions, is not positive-defined.  
 
Such  extensive  vacuum  fluctuations  are  not  confined  to  short  distances.  They  have  first  been 
introduced  in  Ref.  [5]  in  the  framework  of  perturbation  theory,  and  then  re-considered  in  a  more 
general  context  [6].  In  a  first-order  weak  field  approximation  the  factor  (cid:214)g  in  the  action  can  be 
replaced by unity; the null-action condition then reduces to the requirement that the total integral of 
the scalar curvature R be zero, hence the name “dipolar” fluctuations. 
 
In  this  work  we  find  explicitly  several  new  field  configurations  belonging  to  this  set  of  “zero-
modes”  of  the  Einstein  action.  We  go  beyond  the  perturbative  approximation  and  solve  the  full 
strong-field  equations,  finding  almost-singular  configurations  with  large  local  curvature  and 
unbounded volume ((cid:214)g>>1). 
 
The  problem  of  finding  field  configurations  with  zero  total  action  is  in  principle  unrelated  to  the 
Einstein  equations,  which  are  equivalent  to  minimize  the  lagrangian  density.  There  is  a 
mathematical trick, however,  which helps imposing our integral condition while taking  advantage 
of  known  solutions  of  the  Einstein  equations.  We  first  write  the  Einstein  equations  with  a  source 
Tmn, namely

Taking into account (ii), we see that the pure Einstein action S=-(1/8pG)(cid:1)(cid:214)gRd4x computed for this 
solution is zero. The source can be un-physical, because it does not represent any physical object, 
but is only a mathematical artifice allowing to find field configurations having certain pre-defined 
properties. 
 
It  is  convenient  to  choose  static  and  spatially  symmetric  configurations.  Imagine  a  3-sphere  with 
constant  or  almost  constant  scalar  curvature,  surrounded  by  a  shell  with  negative  curvature.  By 
adjusting the sizes of the two regions, and taking into account the volume factor (cid:214)g, it is possible to 
obtain  a  total  null  action.  Technically,  this  amounts  to  solve  the  Einstein  equations  in  the  static, 
spatially symmetric case with a virtual, unphysical source made of a central core with positive mass 
and an outer shell with negative mass. As we shall see, the situation is actually more complicated, 
as the density can vary in many ways and there is a vast choice of possible configurations even in 
this special symmetric case. 
 
Our  recourse  to  un-physical  sources  could  be  reminiscent  of  works  on  solutions  of  the  Einstein 
equations  with  “exotic”  matter  sources  (see  for  instance  [7])  and  of  definitions  of  physically 
acceptable sources [8]. It should be clear from the discussion above, however, that our approach is 
different,  and  independent  from  specific  assumptions  on  the  sources.  It  is  also  essentially  self-

contained,  except  for  the  two  basic  assumptions  mentioned  above  (validity  of  the  Einstein  action 
and of the Feynman integral for gravitation). 
 
 
1. Spherically symmetric metric tensor 
 
Let us now find explicitly the metric of a dipolar fluctuation with spherical symmetry. As we shall 
see, there are several kinds of such fluctuations, having internal 4D volume either bounded or un-
bounded. We shall be especially interested into the unbounded-volume configurations, because they 
are much favoured in the presence of a cosmological/vacuum energy term. 
 
Our  starting  point  is  the  well-known  expression  of  the  Schwarzschild  metric  outside  and  inside  a 
mass distribution with density r(r) in the local inertial frame, namely

This expression is quoted from Ref. [9], p. 608. We have changed the signs in front of dt2, dr2, dq2 
and dj2, in order to adapt the metric to our signature convention (+,-,-,-). We also have inserted 
explicitly the gravitational constant G, which is set to 1 in Ref. [9] through a suitable choice of the 
length unit. The function m(r) represents the mass contained in a 3-sphere of radius r:

where p is the pressure, which in the following we shall take to be zero. At the external boundary 
rext of the mass distribution, f satisfies the condition f(rext)= ½ ln(1-2MG/rext), where M is the total 
mass, M=m(rext). We furthermore have f(0)=0.  
 
All the relations above come from the solution of the Einstein equations with the given source, and 
are often employed in relativistic astrophysical stellar models. In that context, it is also necessary to 
specify relations between the source parameters r and p, compatible with the state equations of the 
stellar matter. In our case, r and p can be instead assigned arbitrarily, because the source can be un-
physical. We shall assign r and p in such a way to obtain metrics for which the integral of the scalar 
curvature (cid:1)(cid:214)gRd4x  is zero (zero-modes of Einstein action). This can be obtained in several different 
ways,  ie  there  exist  several  different  classes  of  zero-modes.  We  shall  always  consider  the  case  of 
null pressure.

The exact meaning of this quantity will soon be clear. It is the radius at which a singularity would 
arise, if the mass distribution were not cut before that point. Let us take r1 and r2 such that r1<r0<r2 
and define a density function r(r) which is equal to r0 up to r1, becomes negative at r1 and then zero 
from r2 on:

and it is seen that its integral up to r1 converges, when r1 approaches r0 from below. We saw in eq. 
(2.5)  the  meaning  of  r0,  as  the  point  where  the  metric  would  become  singular  if  the  virtual  mass 
density r were constant. But before arriving to r0, we change the sign of r; we shall then define r2, 
which until now has not been fixed, in such a way to satisfy the zero-mode condition  (cid:1)(cid:214)gRd4x=0. 
Note that r1 is arbitrary, provided r1<r0. The zero-mode condition can be satisfied in several ways, 
but in order to become familiar with the solutions with un-bounded volume, let us suppose that r1 is 
very close to r0. The scalar curvature R is obtained by remembering that for any solution of Einstein 
equations, independently from the features of the source, one has R=8(cid:2)GTmngmn and therefore in our 
case

This integral can be computed in closed form, but the result is quite bulky and we do not report it

From this, through (2.10), one arrives at the lagrangian density (cid:214)gR. (See also below, eq. (3.18), for 
a  general  expression  of  (cid:214)gR.)  We  have  plotted  below  the  lagrangian  density  (cid:214)gR  and  the  metric 
component g00 setting r0=1 (ie the horizontal axis represents the ratio r/r0), a=0.95 and 8pr0G=1.

Fig.  2  –  Graphs  of  the  g00  metric  element  (a)  and  of  the  adimensional  lagrangian  density 
(cid:214)gR/(8pr0G) (b), as functions of the adimensional radius r/r0, for the case of density r constant 
in  absolute  value,  with  “inversion  radius”  r1  equal  to  the  95%  of  the  Schwarzschild  radius. 
(Compare the example in Fig. 1; here the external radius b=r2/r0 of the negative shell has not 
been represented, however, because it still has to be defined, according to the procedure below.) 

 
So we are going to find, after fixing r2, a zero-mode which looks like a field configuration having 
typical  size  r0,  generated  by  a  positive  spherical  virtual  mass  surrounded  by  a  negative  spherical 
shell. The total mass of the source will not be zero (2.18). The source does not have any physical 
meaning, yet it is possible to visualize the formation of such a vacuum fluctuation by thinking of a 
condensation  of  positive  mass  up  to  a  radius  r1,  followed  by  deposition  of  a  negative  shell.  Such 
fluctuations exist at any length scale. Given a length r0, we can deduce the necessary virtual density 
r through eq. (2.1). For instance, at the atomic scale r0~10-8 cm, remembering that G~10-66 cm2 in 
natural units, we find that the necessary virtual density is r~1082 cm-4 ~ 1045 g/cm3. This is clearly 
an enormous density and corresponds to very strong fields. However, such a high value for r is only 
needed when r1 is close to r0, so that a singularity is approached. At the same length scale, there are 

6 

other less singular zero-modes which  “change sign” earlier; their volume is much smaller, and so 
they will be less affected by a cosmological term, as we shall discuss in Section 4. 
 
The procedure for the mathematical construction of a zero-mode next requires to set the integral of 
(cid:214)gR  to  zero  and  deduce  from  this  that  value  of  r2,  such  that  the  negative  part  of  the  integral 
compensates the positive part. This is possible if the integral does not converge too fast, which has 
to be checked by examining the behaviour of the integrand function. In the example in Fig. 2 we see 
that r2 is not far to the right of r0. Substituting r2 in the integral for M(r), one obtains the total mass 
of the zero-mode:

Apart from possible physical interpretations, this mass has a precise technical meaning: the metric 
outside  the  source  is  a  Schwarzschild  metric  with  total  mass  M.  We  shall  find  that  M  is  always 
negative. In our earlier perturbative calculations [5] we found a much simpler relation between M 
and  the  integral  of  the  lagrangian  density,  namely  (cid:1)(cid:214)gR  =4pMGt,  where  t  is  the  lifetime  of  the 
fluctuation. This relation was a consequence of an approximation in which g00 and (cid:214)g are close to 1. 
It followed that the weak-field zero-modes are really “dipolar” fluctuations, ie they have M=0. For 
strong  fields  we  find,  instead,  that  the  total  mass  is  generally  of  the  same  magnitude  order  as  the 
positive and negative components, and so can be very large for quasi-singular zero-modes. This is 
clearly seen by re-writing M as

where the integral in u is an adimensional quantity of order 1. We do not expect, however, to see 
any  physical  manifestations  of  these  large  negative  virtual  masses,  homogeneously  distributed  in 
space  and  time.  They  are,  at  most,  only  one  of  the  many  contributions  to  the  vacuum  energy 
density, which notoriously though mysteriously manage to combine with each other giving a very 
small total cosmological constant [10]. 
 
 
3. Modes with variable density and unbounded volume 
 
Now  we  make  our  treatment  more  general.  Assuming  that  the  virtual  density  r(r)  decreases,  in 
absolute value, when r increases, one can obtain several different metrics. The simplest case is that 
of  functions  of  the  form  |r(r)|(cid:181)1/ra,  with  a>0.  It  is  easy  to  check  that  for  a‡2  no  singularity  is 
formed. For a=1 we obtain a mode with unbounded volume. The same holds for 1<a<2. But let us 
repeat in detail the same steps of the previous section. The density of the virtual source is

Some graphs of the functions g00 and (cid:214)gR are given below, for six values of a. These are obtained 
by numerical integration of the differential equations. (For integer values of a the integral (3.17) for 
f(r)  can  also  be  computed  explicitly,  but  the  result  is  quite  bulky.)  Like  for  the  solutions  with 
constant virtual density (Fig. 2), the quantity on the horizontal axis is the reduced radius r/r0 and the 
sign of the virtual density is inverted at a distance r1 such that a=r1/r0=0.95 (Fig.s 4, 5) or a=0.99 
(Fig.s 6, 7). 
 
Note that in Fig. 4 the mass distribution of the outer shell has not yet been cut-off at the radius r2 
such  that  the  integral  of  (cid:214)gR  is  zero.  In  Fig.  5,  r2  would  fall  outside  the  depicted  region;  it  is 
possible  to  show,  by  enlarging  the  scale,  that  |(cid:214)gR|  continues  to  grow  almost  linearly.  It  is  also 
apparent from the graphs that r2 shifts more and more to the right when a increases. This means that 
the negative outer shell is much larger than the positive core when a approaches 2 and the virtual 
density decreases quickly with r. Numerical estimates are given in Sect. 5.

4. Change in the zero-mode condition when a cosmological term is present 
 
Let us now introduce into the gravitational action a cosmological term, or vacuum energy term. The 
cosmological term and the R2 terms (see below, Sect. 6) are the most common invariant additions to 
the  pure  Einstein  action,  so  it  is  natural  to  consider  them  here.  In  our  previous  work  on  dipolar 
fluctuations  in  the  perturbative  approach,  we  pointed  out  that  a  cosmological  term  affects  the 
dipolar  fluctuations.  We  noticed  that  the  influence  of  the  cosmological  term  upon  dipolar 
fluctuations could actually be more relevant than its usual “classical” effects (large-scale spacetime 
curvature, etc.). 
  
We have a further special motivation for introducing the cosmological term: we have shown that a 
local  vacuum-like  energy  density  is  present  in  condensed  matter  systems  described  by  a 
macroscopic order parameter [11]. We can expect that a local vacuum energy density term breaks 
the  symmetry  of  the  dipolar  fluctuations  of  the  pure  Einstein  action.  As  we  stressed  above,  these 
fluctuations  can  be  very  large,  but  are  homogeneously  distributed  in  spacetime  and  therefore 
unobservable. 
 
Our present non-perturbative approach gives us a more general insight into the effect of the vacuum 
energy density term. In the gravitational action with a L-term, namely

the  factor  L  multiplies  the  4D  volume  of  spacetime.  In  perturbation  theory,  the  background 
spacetime is taken to be flat. Here, we are instead considering strongly curved and almost singular 
geometries, like "holes" in spacetime having an internal volume much larger than the volume they 
occupy as seen from the outside. These field configurations can only exist as vacuum fluctuations, 
because they have null action but their sources are un-physical. 
 
Let us define better the distinction between "internal" and "external" volume. The internal volume is 
the real volume given by the integral of (cid:214)g from r=0 to the external boundary of the source at r=r2. 
If we look at the whole field configuration, for r>r2 we must describe it as a spherically symmetric 
metric generated by a source of radius r2 and total mass M given by eq.s (3.14), (3.21). We could 
call it a Schwarzschild metric, were it not for the fact that M is negative (because tipically r2>>r1).  
 
For r>r2, the scalar curvature is zero and it is clear from the general expression of the spherically 
symmetric  metric  in  vacuum  that  the  volume  element  (cid:214)g  is  the  same  as  in  flat  space,  because 
g00grr=1. Judging from its field, what we see is therefore  a source with  mass M which occupies  a 
3. We define the source density in a natural way as the ratio M/Vext. As 
space equal to Vext=(4p/3)r2
remarked in Sect. 2, this density can be very large, but it can not have any physical consequences, 
since these sources are just vacuum fluctuations which “pop up” everywhere in spacetime with the 
same probability. 
 
Consider  how  these  fluctuations  and  their  mass  are  modified  by  the  presence  of  a  local 
cosmological term L. The condition S[gmn]=0 now implies a different value for the outer radius r2, 
and therefore for the total mass. The variation DM is a function of the local L, and as such can be 
observed.  This  is  a  crucial  point  of  our  analysis,  a  point  of  possible  contact  between  microscopic 
quantities and observable parameters.

where r2' denotes the new value of the outer radius r2 which satisfies the condition and DV(4)=tDV(3) 
is  the  4D  volume  difference  between  the  considered  configuration  gmn  and  flat  space.  (Thus  the 
volume  V(3)  of  the  fluctuation  would  exactly  be  DV(3)+Vext,  but  we  shall  see  that  DV(3)  is  always 
much  larger  than  Vext.)  After  defining  Dr2=r2'-r2,  by  subtraction  of  the  two  conditions  (4.2)  and 
(3.20) we obtain

The  term  on  the  left  represents  the  effective  density  variation  of  a  fluctuation,  “seen  from  the 
outside”,  when  a  L  term  is  present.  On  the  right,  DV(3)  is  the  difference  between  the  real  internal 
3.  Remembering  that  V(3)>>  Vext  for  the  fluctuations 
volume  of  the  configuration  and  Vext=(4p/3)r2
we  are  interested  in,  we  can  re-write  the  ratio  approximately  as  V(3)/Vext,  and  it  is  very  large  for 
those configurations. The ratio L/G is the mass-energy density equivalent of the L-term, which is 
measured in natural units in cm-4 and in the SI in J/m3.  
 
We recall that the presently accepted value for L/G at the cosmological scale is of the order of 1016 
cm-4, or 0.1 J/m3. A “local” vacuum-energy-like term Lloc due to coherent material fields [11] can 
be  considerably  larger,  up  to  Lloc/G»108  J/m3.  Such  density  is  still  too  small  to  cause  any 
appreciable gravitational effect at the classical level, but its local effect upon the density of dipolar 
vacuum fluctuations is amplified, according to eq. (4.7), by the factors h(r2)/f(r2) and V(3)/Vext. We 
know from the Casimir  effect that local variations in the vacuum fluctuations are observable; and 
these  gravitational  fluctuations  appear  to  be  much  stronger  than  the  fluctuations  in  quantum 
electrodynamics, because of the peculiar non-positive-definite nature of the gravitational action.  
 
Unlike real mass density, variations in the virtual mass density can oscillate fast, following the time 
variations  of  Lloc.  It  is  possible  to  show,  for  instance,  that  in  superconductors  described  by  a 
macroscopic wave function y, Lloc depends on |y| and |(cid:209)y|. In certain conditions, |y| and |(cid:209)y| can 
easily  oscillate  in  time  with  frequencies  of  the  order  of  MHz-GHz.  This  variable  Lloc  amounts 
classically  to  a  small  oscillating  mass-energy  density,  which  generates  in  principle  a  small 
gravitational  field,  too  small  for  detection.  In  the  quantum  theory,  however,  an  oscillating  Lloc 
induces  much  larger  variations  in  the  virtual  mass  density  of  dipolar  vacuum  fluctuations.  If  we 
compute  transition  matrix  elements  in  quantum  gravity  (even  just  perturbatively)  between  the 
vacuum  state  and  states  with  one  or  more  virtual  gravitons  of  energy-momentum  E,  P,  the 
oscillations  of  |y|  and  |(cid:209)y|  play  the  role  of  a  periodic  perturbation  and  the  usual  relations  hold 
between  the  perturbation  frequency  and  E.  The  factor  V(3)/Vext  amplifies  the  perturbation  and  thus 
the transition amplitudes. This mechanism will be studied in more detail in a future work. 
 
 
5. Numerical evaluation 
 
In this section we give an example of numerical solutions of the differential equations for the zero-
modes. Outside the inner radius r1, analytical solutions are not available; there is a formal integral 
expression  (eq.  (3.17)),  but  the  primitive  can  only  be  found  explicitly  for  integer  values  of  the 
exponent a. (a defines the behavior of the virtual density: |r|/r0=(r0/r)a.) It is therefore convenient 
to  solve    the  differential  equation  numerically  from  the  beginning  with  the  Runge-Kutta  method. 
This can be done quickly  for several values of  a, thus obtaining an insight of the behavior of the 
corresponding  solutions.  The  radius  r1  is  always  smaller  than  the  Schwarzschild  radius  r0,  so  that 
singularities are avoided; in terms of the adimensional parameter a=r1/r0, this means a<1. 
 
We saw that when a approaches 1 from below and 1<a<2, the volume of the core is unbounded and 
diverges  like  a  power  of  1/(1-a).  Such  large-volume  fluctuations  are  most  relevant  when  a 
cosmological term L is present in the action. The ensuing "amplification" of the L-term (eq. (4.7)) 

 

16 

also depends on the ratio of the metric-related functions h(r) and f(r) evaluated at the cut-off point 
r2. Therefore the crucial points to be checked through numerical evaluation are the following. 
 
(1) Check that it is always possible to satisfy the zero-mode condition, ie the radius r2 exists. The 
answer is positive in all cases. The lagrangian density (cid:214)gR grows almost linearly for large values of 
r, so it is quite simple to estimate r2. One generally finds that for the configurations more close to 
the  singularity  (a  close  to  1)  the  radius  r2  is  much  larger  than  the  core  radius  r1.  The  numerical 
integration of (cid:214)gR (which is itself a numerical solution of a differential equation) can be done most 
safely  by  separating  the  two  regions  r<r1  and  r>r1.  The  discontinuity  at  r=r1  does  not  represent  a 
problem.  In  order  to  determine  r2,  we  first  find  the  integral  from  r=0  to  r=r1,  then  we  make  a 
polynomial  fit  of  (cid:214)gR  for  r>r1  and  impose  that  the  integral  of  the  polynomial  cancels  the  first 
integral. This yields an approximate value of r2. Then we can perform the real numerical integration 
up  to  this  value  “–e”,  and  determine  a  safe  error  interval  e  by  checking  that  the  integral  changes 
sign between r2+e and r2-e. Actually, for our present purposes it is sufficient to find a lower limit 
for r2 – see Point 2 below. 
 
For instance, with a=0.99 and a=1.7 the lagrangian density (cid:214)gR has the following behaviour (Fig. 
9, first until r/r0=2 and then at larger distances):

Fig. 9 – Behavior of the lagrangian density (cid:214)gR for a=0.99, a=1.7. At large distances, this is well 
approximated by a quadratic function. 

 
The integral from 0 to 0.99 gives +0.115. A quadratic fit of the function at large distances, based on 
the points (0;0), (100; -0.00013), (300; -0.00025), (500; -0.00034), (800; -0.00045), gives 
 

R(cid:214)g » - 9(cid:215)10-7 (r/r0) + 5(cid:215)10-10 (r/r0)2   

 

 

(5.1) 

 
Imposing that the integral of this function equals -0.115, we find that r2/r0 must be larger than 500. 
 
(2) Evaluate the ratio between external and internal volume of the configuration. This ratio has been 
defined  in  Sect.  4  and  equals  the  average  of  the  ratio  between  the  volume  element  (cid:214)gdr  of  the 
fluctuation and the volume element of flat space 4pr2dr, in the interval (0, r2). One always observes 
that this ratio has a peak at r=r1, as anticipated (see Fig. 7) The height of the peak depends on the 
regulator (1-a). This “peak inside the core” does not make, however, the dominant contribution to 
the volume of the fluctuation. The dominant contribution comes from the region just to the right of 
r1, where we do not know the analytic form of the metric. The reason for this, as can be seen from 
the graphs of the metric, is that g00 reaches its maximum to the right of r1, and then decreases due to 
the effect of the negative density outside the core. 

 

17 

 
Going back to our example of Fig. 9, we find that the volume ratio (cid:214)g/r2 (we omitted the 4p in the 
calculations and in Table 1) in the interval (0,0.99) is equal to 4380; the integral from 0.99 to 500 is 
2.55(cid:215)106, therefore the average of (cid:214)g/r2 is ca. 5.1(cid:215)103. 
 
(3) Evaluate the function h(r)/f(r) at r=r2. (Compare Fig. 8.) In our example, we find that this is of 
the order of 500. 
 
Note  that  the  overall  amplification  factor  ((cid:214)g/r2)[h(r)/f(r)]  will  be  under-estimated  whenever  r2  is 
over-estimated, because both the average volume ratio (cid:214)g/r2 and the metric ratio h(r2)/f(r2) decrease 
with r, when r>>r1. Taking advantage of this, we used a graphical approximation to evaluate over-
estimated values of r2 and thus under-estimated values of the ratios (cid:214)g/r2 and h/f and of the overall 
amplification  factor.  These  are  given  in  Table  1.  Any  value  can  be  checked  through  the  more 
elaborate  fit  procedure  mentioned  above.  See,  for  instance,  how  the  values  for  a=0.99  and  a=1.7 
compare with the exact values.

Table  1  -  Under-estimated  values  for  the  amplification  factor  of  the  cosmological  term  in  a 
dipolar vacuum fluctuation (eq. (4.7)). a is the regulator, ie the ratio of the fluctuation core r1 to 
the Schwarzschild radius r0. a is the exponent determining the spatial decrease of the virtual mass 
density. r2 is the radius of the outer negative shell, such that the total action of the fluctuation is 
zero. (cid:214)g/r2 is the average ratio of the internal volume element to the flat volume element. h/f is an 
additional  amplification  factor  arising  from  the  metric  components  evaluated  at  r2.  The  total 
amplification factor can be very large for a close to 2, but this also implies that the outer radius r2 
is much larger than the core r1~r0. 

 
 
6. Final remarks 
 
It is natural to ask whether, and to which extent, the presence of R2 terms in the gravitational action 
changes  the  above  picture.  The  R2  terms  are  thought  to  arise  in  any  effective  action  of  quantum 
gravity,  due  to  quantum  corrections.  They  are  positive-definite  and  can  not  cancel  each  other  in 
different  regions  like  the  Einstein  R  term.  Numerical  simulations  usually  comprise  the  R2  terms.

They  are  relevant  only  at  very  small  scales,  and  we  shall  see  that  for  dipolar  fluctuations  of 
atomic/nuclear size they can be disregarded. 
 
In general, a term hR2 in the action changes the field configurations described above by increasing 
or  decreasing  their  external  radius  r2.  If  the  coefficient  h  is  positive,  r2  increases,  because  the 
integral of (cid:214)gR needs to “pick up” some more negative  curvature from the outer shell in order to 
yield a null action. The total mass of the configuration is therefore slightly  increased. This effect, 
however, is re-absorbed in the unobservable contribution to the homogeneous virtual mass density. 
For a numerical estimate, consider for instance a fluctuation with outer radius r2 of the order of the 
Bohr  radius,  namely  r2=10-8  cm.  With  regulator  a=0.999  and  exponent  a=1.7,  the  amplification 
factor  is  at  least  6(cid:215)108  (Table  1).  The  ratio  r2/r0  is  at  most  3(cid:215)104,  so  the  core  of  the  fluctuation  is 
-2  »  1025  cm-2.  The 
larger  than  an  atomic  nucleus.  The  scalar  curvature  R  is  at  most  of  order  r1
relative magnitude of the Einstein term R/G and the R2 terms hR2 is (hRG)-1 » h-1(cid:215)1041, where we 
put  G»10-66  cm2  in  natural  units.  h  denotes  the  adimensional  coefficient  of  the  R2  term,  which  is 
unknown, but has been estimated in the simulations by Hamber [2] at less than unity. It follows that 
the R2 terms can be disregarded in comparison to the Einstein term at this length scale. 
 
It is also interesting to note the magnitude order of the virtual mass density variation predicted, with 
the parameters above, in the presence of a local vacuum energy term with Lloc/G » 108 J/m3 (Sect. 
4).  The  conversion  factor  1/c2  to  mass  density  and  the  adimensional  amplification  factor  together 
give a density variation DM/Vext  » 1 kg/m3. (And the amplification factor can easily be larger, for 
smaller  cores  or  more  singular  configurations.)  This  variation  follows  the  time  behaviour  of  Lloc, 
possibly  at  high  frequency  and  with  sign  inversion.  The  potential  interest  of  these  fluctuations  as 
sources in processes involving virtual gravitons is therefore clear.

This note summarizes the evolution of the Muon-ID package originally written by R. Markeloff at NIU. The original method 

used  a  helical  swimmer  to  extrapolate  the  tracks  from  the  interaction  point  and  to  collect  hits  in  all  sub-detectors:  the 

electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and muon detector. The package was modified to replace the swimmer by a stepper 

which does account for both the effects of the magnetic field and for the losses by ionization in the material encountered by the 

particle. The modified package shows a substantial improvement in the efficiency of muon identification. Further improvement 

should be reached by accounting for stochastic processes via the utilization of a Kalman filter. 

1.  INTRODUCTION  

Muon  identification  procedure  involves  a  comparison  of  the  charged  track  trajectory  reconstructed  in  the  tracking 

systems  with  the  location  of  energy  deposits  detected  in  the  calorimeters  and  the  muon  detectors.  This  comparison 

requires  that  the  track  trajectory  is  extrapolated  beyond  the  tracking  detectors.  The  initial  extrapolation  method,  the 

swimmer,  was  based  on  the  helical  extrapolation  of  the  track.  While  it  is  an  acceptable  approximation  for  large 

momentum  tracks,  it  fails  at  the  low  momentum  end  of  the  spectrum  where  the  energy  loss  and  multiple  scattering 

cause  significant  deviation  of  the  actual  track  trajectory  from  an  ideal  helix,  the  discrepancy  being  amplified  by  the 

bending effect in the strong magnetic field. 

The  Stepper  software  propagates  the  charged  track  through  the  detector  in  small  steps  accounting  for  dE/dx  and 

 effects [1] at each step. It improves the identification and reconstruction efficiency of low energy muons by up 

The Kalman filter should further improve the results by taking into account multiple scattering, Bremsstrahlung and 

other  stochastic  processes.  This  note  describes  the  general  principles  of  the  muon  reconstruction  package  and  its 

The  stepper  starts  with  a  particle  at  the  interaction  point  (IP)  and  it  computes  step-wise  the  particle  trajectory

undergo  changes  due  to  the  qv×B  term  whereas  the  energy  loss  in  material  contributes  to  a  reduction  of  all  the

2.2.  The Muon Candidate 

The muon identification algorithm requires a well fitted charged track consistent with the observed energy deposits in 

EM  and  HAD  calorimeters  and  at  least  12  hits  /12  Layers  within  an  extrapolated  ( , 

)  road  in  the  muon  detector. 

Calorimetric  cells  are  associated  with  a  track  if  they  are  within  2  angular  bins  in  the  EM  calorimeter  and  the  muon 

detector or 3 angular bins in the HAD calorimeter,  ( 

= =  /840 in EMCal

, 

= =  /600 in HADCal,  

= = 

/150 in the muon detector). The current version of the muon ID package is restricted to the barrel detector, 

defined as 0.95< <2.2.

2.3.  Improvement in Track Reconstruction  

We have compared the performance of the muon identification algorithm using the stepper with that of the original 

package of R. Markeloff using the standard swimmer for the track extrapolation to calorimeters and muon chambers. 

The  swimmer  approach  does  not  account  for  the  energy  loss  in  the  calorimeters,  hence  it  fails  for  low  momentum 

muons. We have improved its performance for the low momentum tracks by introducing momentum-dependent cuts, 

(

,  

~ 1/p),

on the distance between the extrapolated track and the calorimeter/muon detector cell. This version of 

the package is denoted as  Swimmer + Ad Hoc dE/dx . 

In  Figure  1  and  Table  I  are  shown  the  muon ID  efficiency  improvement  with  the  evolution  of  the  algorithm  for 

single muons from 3GeV to 50 GeV.

wide whereas   ( Track- Hits) for a 4 GeV muon is ~ 4 times bigger. The remaining inefficiency  at low muon 

momentum is primarily due to the stochastic nature of processes not accounted for by the stepper, e.g. multiple 

scattering, Beamstrahlung or decays.

2.4.  Muon Identification in Jets  

  Reconstruction and identification of single muons is a relatively easy task. The more difficult, albeit more realistic, 

case  involves  muon  identification  in  high  energy  jets.  In  such  an  environment,  in  addition  to  the  issue  of  the 

identification efficiency, we encounter an issue of the purity of the  muon  sample. Most of particles in jets are hadrons, 

PSN-1011   

 
 
 
 

,Stanford U.S.A., March-19- 2005 - Stanford ILCWS05   

hence even with small probability of mis-identification of the fake muons may overwhelm the muon candidates sample. 
To  study  these issues we have  generated  a sample  of  10,000  b-quark  pair  events produced  in  e+   e-   collisions  at  the 

center  of  mass  energy  up  to  500  GeV.  Table  II  shows  a  breakdown  of  generated  charged  particles  in  this  sample. 

Particles below 3 GeV do not penetrate the muon detector, hence they cannot be identified as muons.  

A significant fraction of hadron-induced showers spills over to the muon detectors and is classified as muons by the 

muon identification algorithm as described earlier. The rate of such fake muon candidates can be reduced by exploiting 

the  fact  that  the  hadronic  showers  deposit  most  of  their  energy  in  the  innermost  layers  of  the  hadron  calorimeter,  as 

illustrated in Fig. 3.   We have augmented the muon ID package by adding a requirement that there are hits along the 

muon  candidate  trajectory  in  the  last  four  layers  of  the  hadron  calorimeter.  This  requirement  does  not  lead  to  any 

additional losses of the genuine muons, but it reduces the rates of mis-identified hadrons to those listed in the Table. II. 

It is worthwhile to notice that 12 of the mis-identified pions and 3 of the kaons   are, in fact, decays thus resulting in a 

genuine muon present in the muon detector.

The  average  efficiency  of  the  muon  reconstruction  and  identification  in  jets  turns  out  to  be  about  83.5%.which  is  

accounted for principally by the abundance of low energy muons. We start from reconstructed tracks  by the tracker. 

The  muon  identification  package  based  on  the  stepper  approach  shows  an  improvement  over  the  previous  version 

utilizing  the  swimmer.  The  improved  version  of  the  swimmer-based  algorithm,  utilizing  an  ad-hoc  dE/dx 

implementation,  identifies  only  76.6%  of  the  muons  and  the  swimmer-based  original  algorithm  alone  65.3%  of  the 

All performance figures quoted above for the efficiency of background rejection and signal identification refer to the 

number of tracks above 3 GeV.  The fake rate probabilities for 

s, K s and protons, including punch-through, given by 

the stepper algorithm are 0.0037, 0.0092 and 0.0012, respectively.  

The hadron filtering using the 4 last layers of HADCal suggests that a study of 2 to 4 sensitive planes with a finer grain, 

located between the coil and the muon detector could be useful     

muons.

3.  THE KALMAN FILTER 

We  expect  that  further  improvement  of  the  muon  identification  efficiency  can  be  accomplished  if  the  predicted 

trajectory  of  the  muon  could  account  for  actual  occurrences  of  stochastic  processes,  like  multiple  scattering.  At  the 

same time we expect that background rejection capabilities can be improved if the decay kinks can be detected. 

Both of these goals can be achieved, in as much as it is possible, by the application of a Kalman filter technique. Its 

main  advantage  over  the  other  methods  of  track  extrapolation  stems  from  its  ability  to  use  actual  measurements  to 

adjust local track parameters and to offer a better prediction for the track trajectory. 

3.1.  The Principle 

We have chosen a 6-dimensional phase space point (x, y ,z, px, py, pz) to represent a state vector. The state vector at 

location k-1, is propagated using a propagation matrix, to location k. The choice of the state vector as the phase point 

allows the use of the stepper algorithm written in a matrix form as the propagation matrix. Propagation is done in small 

steps, in general smaller than the thickness of the absorber plates. The multiple scattering in the material is included in 

the covariance matrix. In the active material, that provides a measurement of the actual track position, the Kalman filter 

weighting procedure is applied using the estimate at k: xk(-) and the actual measurement at k, zk . At this point, a new  

state  vector xk(+).   Is  calculated  using  the weighting  procedure which  combines  the  extrapolated  and  measured  track 

positions. As shown in Figure 4, the changes in vector state accounts for the dE/dx and Bz, it is taken into account in the 

propagation matrix (step 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) in the passive material. The multiple scattering is taken care of   by a change in 

the covariant matrix (steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).The change in the vector state which  accounts for the Kalman Weighting as a 

result of all the above, takes place when the hit is recorded in the active material (step 6)

accumulate the multiple scattering contribution to the covariance matrix; step six in the active material leads to an 

improvement of the local track parameters.

The Kalman filter has been implemented in the Muon code and will be tested and optimized. It is applied from the 

electro-magnetic calorimeter on, through the hadron calorimeter the coil and the muon detector. It accounts for multiple 

scattering and other stochastic processes as well as for the dE/dx. It applies a realistic propagation using  information 

from the data. We expect further improvement in the muon identification and reconstruction. In jets we aim for a better 

muon separation from neighboring hadrons.

Hollow  cathode  discharges  (HCD)  are  capable  of  generating  dense  plasmas  and  have  been  used  for 
development  of  high-rate,  low-pressure,  high-efficiency  processing  machines.  The  geometric  feature  of  a 
HCD  promotes  oscillations  of  hot  electrons  inside  the  cathode,  thereby  enhancing  ionization,  ion 
bombardment of inner walls and other subsequent processes. At the same power the hollow cathode exhibits 
plasma density one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional planar electrodes [1].  

The aim  of the present studies was to obtain experimental observations about the main features of a dc 
hollow cathode discharge in order to evaluate its capability of generating compounds in the plasma medium, 
by reaction between sputtered species from the cathode and radicals from the gas discharge.  Especial interest 
is  focused  on  aluminum  nitride  (AlN)  formation  which  is  very  desirable  if  a  deposition  of  thin  film  of  this 
material is concerned. The hollow cathode consists of two parallel aluminum plates and the discharge gas was 
a  mixture  of  argon  and  nitrogen  within  the  pressure  range  of  10  to  50  Pa.  A  Helmholtz  coil  was  used  to 
produce a low intensity and uniform B-field along the axis of the discharge, within the range of (0 – 30).10-3 
T. The discharge voltage was in the range of (300 – 900) V corresponding to discharge currents in the range 
(10 – 800) mA.  Plasma properties were inferred from the current-voltage characteristics of a single Langmuir 
probe  positioned  at  the  inter-cathode  space.  For  a  fixed  inter-cathode  distance,  the  electron  density  and 
electron temperature were measured for different values of the gas pressure, discharge voltage and magnetic 
field intensity. Typical values are in the range of (1016 – 1017) m-3 and (2 – 5) eV for the electron density and 
the electron temperature respectively. Through mass spectrometry technique some species in the plasma gas 
phase could be monitored for various operating conditions of the discharge. This mass analysis together with 
the probe measurements gives guidance for optimization of AlN generation in the discharge consequently for 
deposition of thin films of this material.

1. Introduction 
 

High-density  plasmas  typical  of  hollow  cathodes  (HC)  discharges  are  based  on  efficient  avalanche 
multiplication of electrons known as a hollow cathode effect (HCE) — large increases in current density with 
reduced separation of the two cathodes. In a dc circuit, this effect is connected with oscillations of electrons 
between  equivalent  repelling  potentials  of  sheaths  at  opposite  inner  walls  in  the  cathode  and  consequent 
effects, for example the ionization of gas, ion bombardment of inner walls with the secondary emission and 
thermo emission of electrons, etc. Hollow cathode (HC) discharges have too an important characteristic that 
combines  two  important  processes,  i.e.  sputtering  and  excitation/ionization  of  the  sputtered  atoms.  The  HC 
plasma  properties  can  be  enhanced  through  the  use  of  various  geometrics,  magnetic  field  and  discharge 
operating  mode  modifications  [1].  It  is  known  that  by  controlling  the  magnetic  field  geometry  close  to  the 
discharge [2], the electrical characteristics (discharge current versus discharge voltage) can be modified, for 
more efficient processing. This feature is particularly useful to increase the discharge current at low running 
pressures and hence increase the sputter and deposition rates.  

In this paper, data obtained from mass spectrometry (MS) and Langmuir electrical probes on a d.c. HC 
discharge  with  aluminum  cathode  in  nitrogen  and  argon/nitrogen  are  presented  and  discussed.  This 
investigation  has the objective  of obtaining preliminary results to evaluate the applicability or the discharge 
system for deposition of thin films of aluminum nitrite (AlN). Many techniques, such as sputtering, chemical 
vapor  deposition,  laser  chemical  vapor  deposition,  pulsed  laser  ablation  and  molecular  beam  epitaxy,  have 
been used to fabricate AlN thin films on various substrates. In most of the cases the deposition temperatures 
are quite high. High temperature deposition has the disadvantage of degradation of the substrate and the AlN 
thin film during deposition due to thermal damages. Hence, deposition of AlN thin films at low temperatures 
has become  increasingly  important and valuable [3]. Sputtering technique is promising under circumstances 
where  temperature  deposition  low  and  conformal  coatings  are  needed  [4].  As  an  alternative  to  the  usual

magnetron  sputtering  technique  the  configuration  of  planar  hollow  cathode,  which  is  a  much  simpler  and 
cheaper system,  may have some advantages for the generation of a high density plasma and efficient cathode 
sputtering.  A  study  of  the  HC  plasma  system  is  therefore  desirable  to  infer  its  applicability  for  material 
processing. 
 
2. Experimental 
 
A. Reactor Configuration 
 

The scheme of the plasma reactor used in this investigation is shown in Fig. 1. The discharge resembles 
a  glow  discharge  regime  extending  from  the  hollow  anode  (earth  potential)  up  to  the  flat  cathodes  made  of 
aluminum.  The  hollow  anode  is  made  of  titanium  tubing  of  7  mm  external  diameter,  covered  by  a  ceramic 
tube terminated by an orifice of 2.0 mm diameter. The internal diameter of the hollow anode cavity is 4 mm. 
The  orifice  constricts  the  anode  discharge  to  form  electrostatic  layers  which  contribute  to  increase  the 
ionization  rate  in  the  anodic  region.  The  vacuum  glass  chamber  of  130  mm  internal  diameter  and  300  mm 
length  was  preliminary  evacuated  using  a  combination  of  rotary  and  diffusion  pumps  to  achieve  a  residual 
pressure  of  10-2  Pa.  The  gas  flows  were  controlled  with  MKS  electronic  mass  flow  meters  and  the  gas 
pressure was monitored by a MKS capacitance vacuum gauge. The gases were fed through the anode hole at a 
flow rate within the range of (1-40) sccm. The plane hollow-cathode d.c. discharge was operated with a gas 
composition of Ar/N2 with pressure within the range of (10-50) Pa. The self-sustained cathode-anode voltage 
(during  operation)  was  in  the  range  (300-900)  V  with  a  discharge  current  in  the  range  of  (10-800)  mA.  A 
Helmholtz coil was used to produce a low intensity and uniform B-field along the axis of the discharge, with 
strength  within  the  range  of  (0-30).10-3  T.  The  confining  magnetic  field  perpendicular  to  the  cathode  plates 
enhances  the  pendulum  motion  of  hot  electrons  between  the  cathodes  thus  facilitating  the  hollow  cathode 
effect, accordingly promoting high rate of cathode sputtering by the impact of plasma ions.

B. Plasma Diagnostics Techniques 
 

The reactor is equipped with two diagnostic tools, namely: 
1)  Langmuir  Electrical  Probe:  This  technique  has  been  utilized  to  fulfill  the  need  of  identifying  the 
macroscopic parameters of the discharge (plasma density, the plasma potential and the electron temperature), 
which are the real “fingerprints” of a plasma reactor. LEP measurements have been performed by using the 
configuration of cylindrical single probe. This probe, positioned inside the cathode plasma and at the axis of 
the  discharge,  essentially  consists  of  one  tungsten  wire  of  5  mm  in  length  and  0,1  mm  in  diameter.  The 
unexposed length of the probe was covered with glass and attached to the base of the probe manipulator. The 
plasma generated between the cathodes is characterized by the presence of impurity metal-ions, gas ions and 
new  compounds  due  to  intensive  ion  sputtering  of  the  cathode,  thus  promoting  the  contamination  of  the 

 

2

chamber  walls  and  of  the  electrostatic  probes.  Prior  to  IxV  measurements  the  probe  surface  is  cleaned  by 
polarizing  the  probe  at  the  cathode  potential  during  a  period  short  enough  for  the  probe  to  reach 
incandescence by ion bombardment heating. 

The  probe  biasing  circuit  is  show  in  Fig.  1.  The  points  labeled  Y  input,  measuring  Ip,  and  X  input, 
measuring  Vp,  correspond  to  the  Y  and  X  channels  of  the  plotter.  The  circuit  is  usually  a  little  more 
complicated, since V0 is not only variable, but must be able to change signs. The voltage can also be swept at 
a slow rate.

plasma inter-cathode distance of 30 mm. 

 
Typically  output  of  the  probe  current  (Ip)  at  different  applied  voltage  (Vp)  is  shown  in  Fig.  2.  The 
analysis of I-V curves according to the procedure described in [6] provides the values of electron density (ne) 
and temperature (Te). 
 

2) Mass Spectrometer (MS):  
There are nowadays a whole range of techniques available for analyzing glow discharges, for process 
control  and  for  monitoring  deposition  rates.  With  the  aim  of  analyzing  the  species  in  the  plasma,  a  mass 
spectrometer AccuQuadTM with a resolution of 1 amu, was adapted to the vacuum chamber trough a drifting 
tube  for  monitoring  the  mass  spectra  for  different  plasma  parameters.  The  species  were  sampled  through  a 
micro  orifice  located  at  the  mass  spectrometer’s  entrance.  The  typical  operation  pressure  within  the  mass 
spectrometer was 10-5 Pa. The collected spectra were recorded in the mass range from 1 to 100 amu.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
 
1) Electron Density and Temperature 
 

For the determination of the temperature and density of electrons (ne, Te,) a cylindrical probe located in 

the discharge axis, parallel to the cathode plate as used (see Fig. 3).

A  representative  probe  I-V  characteristic,  measured  for  inter-cathode  distance  of  30  mm,  is  given  in 
figure  2.  Two  important  points  of  the  characteristic  are    V f   (floating  potential,  Ip  =  0)  and  Vp   (plasma 
potential). If the potential of the probe (V s ) is negative with respect  to the plasma potential, then the number 
density of the electrons that  can reach the probe, assuming Boltzmann electron energy distribution,  is

The value of Vp , which can be easily read from the plot of lnIp versus Vp (Fig. 4) is about  -39 V with 
respect to earth. The floating potential V f  measured at the point F (Fig. 2) is about -52 V. This means that the 
net floating potential measured in relation to the plasma (V f -Vp ) is about -13 V.

 is determined from the expression (4) by using the value of Te. In this 

The temperature and density of the plasma electrons nearby the ionic sheath determine the positive ion 
flux towards a surface. Therefore, the temperature and density of the electrons of the plasma in the vicinity of 
the deposition substrate are relevant plasma parameters in determining the structure and surface properties of 
the  deposited  film.  In this  section results  concerning  the  effect  of the d.c. discharge  power  and  longitudinal 
magnetic field, on the temperature and density of the plasma electrons in the nitrogen plasma are reported. 

It  is  well  known  that  the  product  (Pd),  of  the  inter-cathode  distance  (d)  by  the  pressure  (P),  is  an 
important  parameter  to  describe  the  behavior  of  the  HC  discharge.  Usually,  the  electron-atom  inelastic 
collision  rates  are  increased  by  the  decrease  of  the  inter-cathode  distance  with  a  large  effect  on  the  plasma 
density and electron temperature. The effect of the gas pressure on the discharge properties is expected since 
the increase of the collisionality by increasing the pressure tends to enhance the hollow cathode effects being 
possible  to reach  an  optimized reduced inter-cathode distance  (Pd).  Probe measurements  were performed  at 
gas pressure of 13,3 Pa and inter-cathode distance within the range of (20 – 65)mm for constant values of the 
discharge voltage, maintaining fixed the nitrogen flow rate. Fig. 5-a shows the dependence of plasma density 
on  Pd  for  three  values  of  the  discharge  voltage.  In  general  we  observe  that  the  curves  have  a  descendent 
behaviour  with  the  density  decreasing  being  more  pronounced  in  the  branch  of  low  values  of  Pd.  In  this 
branch, the density increases sharply with a decreasing inter-cathode distance (for fixed pressure) because the 
high energy electrons, which are emitted by the cathode, oscillate between repelling potential of the sheaths at 

 

5

 

opposite cathode walls. These electrons enhance ionization in the negative glow and in the sheaths. Thus, due  
to  the  effect  of  electrostatic  electron  confinement,  at    low  values  of  Pd,  the  plasma  assumes  high  values  of  
electron  and  ion  density    thus  reverting  in  higher  sputtering  rates  of  the  cathode  material.  The  discharge 
current, fig. 5-b, exhibits similar behavior.

The application of a weak magnetic field perpendicularly to the cathode surface facilitates the ignition 
of  the  discharge  and  enhances  -  depending  on  the  operating  pressure  and  the  inter-cathode  distance  -  the 
hollow cathode effect by promoting an increase of the residence time of electrons in the cathodic cavity and 
by  reducing  the  lateral  diffusion.  Consequently  the  discharge  current  and  electron  density  increase  with  the 
application of a magnetic field as can be observed in the figures 6 a-b.

Figure 6. Effect of the magnetic field on the electron density and discharge current for constant values of the 
discharge voltage and gas pressure. 
 
            The nature of the gas affects also the discharge properties as illustrated in fig.7. The hollow cathode 
effect is more pronounced for oxygen and less pronounced for argon. 

 

Figure  8  presents  the  dependence  of  the  electron  temperature  on  the  inter-cathode  distance  at  three 
values  of  the  discharge  power  for  nitrogen  discharge.  By  increasing  the  inter-cathode  distance,  the  electron 
temperature decreases, as expected: at low inter-cathode distances, the electrons lose little energy in inelastic 
collisions with the atoms/molecules and their mean value of the kinetic energy (electron temperature) is high. 

 

6

As the distance d increases, more collisions occur, the electron kinetic energy loss through electron inelastic 
collisions  with  neutral  atoms/molecules  increases  thus  the  electron  temperature  decreases.  Also,  because  of 
their  high  electron  affinity,  the  N2  atoms  capture  low  energy  electrons  from  plasma  and  form  negative  ions 
with the effects of increasing of temperature of the plasma electrons for low Pd values.

Figure 9. Effect of the magnetic field on the electron temperature at a constant value of the discharge voltage. 
 

A substantial decreasing of the measured electron temperature was observed when a magnetic field was 
applied,  as  shown  in  Fig.  9.    This  effect  is  not  totally  related  to  the  plasma  electrons  temperature  decrease 
only but probably due to the effect of magnetic field on the electron flux reaching the probe. Especially for 
low  values  of  Pd  the  hot  oscillating  electrons  (pendulum  effect)  have  a  more  directional  motion  – 
perpendicular to the cathode surfaces – and the magnetic field favors this orientation. On the other hand it is 
known that the application of a magnetic field on a glow discharge has the equivalent effect of an increase of 
the gas pressure thereby a decrease of the effective electron temperature. 

 

 

3) Plasma composition analysis by mass spectrometry 
 

A large number of variables affect the balance between competing chemical and physical processes in 
discharge plasma. Appropriate reliable diagnostic tools are therefore necessary to provide an understanding of 
the plasmas and the actual phenomena taking place, which in turn will enable the control of the process. Mass 
spectrometry has been shown to be one very useful tool for diagnostics of cold plasmas.  

In this investigation, our main interest is to search for evidences of aluminum nitride (AlN) compounds 
formation  in  the  plasma  medium  of  a  HC  discharge  made  of  aluminum  cathode  and  running  with  nitrogen 
gas. A typical mass spectrum of sampled gaseous components formed in the discharge is presented in figure 
10. The partial pressure is plotted as function of the mass with partial pressure on a logarithmic scale to make 
possible the comparison of the peak intensities within a range of four orders of magnitude. In the atomic mass 
unit (amu) range of 1 to 100 we observe many peaks and among them we can distinguish: hydrogen molecule 
at  2,  water  that  leads  to  the  primary  peaks  at  17  and  18  due  to  the  species  O+,  HO+,  and  H2O+,  nitrogen 
molecule  at  mass  28  which  also  causes  the  peaks  at  14  assigned  to  atomic  nitrogen  N+  and  doubly  ionized 
++. Molecular oxygen is shown a peak at 32. Carbon dioxide appears with a peak at 44 and also the peaks 
N2
++ and C+ at 22 and 12 respectively. There are other peaks caused by fragments of these species and 
for CO2
contaminants.  The  line  at  m/z  =  41,  assigned  to  the  aluminum  nitride  molecule  is  clearly  seen.  The 
appearance of AlN+ peak corroborates our hypothesis that this compound is present in the plasma medium and 
may contribute, besides of the aluminum atom (at peak 27) and nitrogen radicals, to the mass flux reaching a 
substrate where AlN film is grown.

Figure  10.  Mass  spectrum  of  the  discharge  in  N2  for  pressure  of  13,3  Pa,  subtracted  from  background 
spectrum. 
 

The AlN+ line can be monitored as function of the operating parameters of the discharge. In the Figs. 
11 and 12 the relative percentage of AlN+ and Al+ peak height were plotted as function of the inter-cathode 
distance,  for  two  values  of  pressure  (P).  For  discharge  processes  where  the  operation  pressure  is  lower 
(fig.11),  the  curve  indicates  that  the  generation  of  aluminum  nitride  molecules  reaches  a  maximum  for  a 
certain inter-cathode distance. This maximum is less pronounced at lower pressure (fig. 12).

               By varying the percentage of nitrogen in the argon/nitrogen mixture we observe, from figure 13, that 
the AlN peak height can vary within three orders of magnitude. This figure indicates also that, as far as the 
deposition rate of AlN thin films is concerned, the percentage o nitrogen to be used should be in the range of 
50% to 100%

4. Conclusions 
 

Investigations  were  made  on  a  hollow  aluminum  cathode  discharge  operating  with  nitrogen  and 
argon/nitrogen.  A  cylindrical  Langmuir  probe  was  used  to  measure  the  density  and  temperature  of  the 
electrons of hollow cathode nitrogen plasma. The dependence of these plasma parameters on the inter-cathode 
distance,  discharge  voltage  and  magnetic  field  was  experimentally  determined.  The  plasma  has  electron 
density  of  the  order  of  1016  m-3  and  electron  temperature  in  the  range  of  (2  –  5)  eV.  Through  mass 
spectrometry technique various compounds generated in the discharge were identified. An important result of 
this work was the demonstration of the presence of aluminum nitride (AlN) molecule in the plasma. Due to 
ion bombardment and an enhanced cathode temperature, aluminum atoms are sputtered from the cathode and 
react with nitrogen radicals to form AlN+ in the plasma medium. The results obtained by monitoring the AlN 
peak  of  the  mass  spectrum  combined    with  Langmuir  probe  measurements  can    indicate    the  optimal  
operating conditions of  the hollow cathode system for enhanced generation of AlN molecules in the plasma 
and hence for growing thin films of aluminum nitride.

INTRODUCTION 

 
Physics in Films is an alternative version of the physical science course offered to 
non-science  majors  at  the  University  of  Central  Florida  (Efthimiou  and  Llewellyn, 
2006a). The course uses the popularity of Hollywood films to generate interest in science 
and  to  engage  students  that  have  traditionally  been  resistant  to  taking  science  courses. 
Scenes  that  lead  to  teachable  science  moments  are  identified  in  films  and  then  used  in 
class to concretize abstract physical concepts. With the wide variety of movies available, 
different “flavors” of the course, each specializing  in a certain genre of  film,  have  been 
created. This creates an audience of students with a high level of interest in the teaching 
tool and helps enhance their learning experience. In addition to the films, the course uses 
electronic  student  response  systems  to  increase  class  participation.  Although  the  course 
was  first  developed  during  the  academic  year  2002-2003,  we  continue  to  develop  and 
assess  it.   After a  brief outline of the  motivation  for the development of the  course, we 
will  discuss  the  different  versions  of  the  course  and  the  teaching  techniques  used, 
including the use of the student response systems, and present data on the performance of 
the  students  in  the  course.    Moreover,  we  will  present  feedback  on  the  course  acquired 
from video interviews with participating students. 
 
Motivation 

The  required  curriculum  for  University  of  Central  Florida  non-science  majors 
includes a class  in physical  science. A  similar course  is required  for graduation at  most 
universities  and  many  two-year  colleges.  Unfortunately,  many  students  approach  the 
class with apprehension. Registration in this required course is often postponed until the 
student’s  last  semester,  increasing  the  student’s  anxiety.  Sometimes  the  students  are 
worried that the mathematics required in the course will be too difficult, but more often, 
they  simply  feel  that  the  subject  matter  is  boring.  They  view  knowledge  of  physical 
science  and  an  understanding  of  the  scientific  process  as  irrelevant  to  their  lives.  This 
misconception  is  dangerous  to  the  student  and  to  our  society  in  general.  Without  this 
knowledge,  the  distinction  between  science  and  pseudoscience  becomes  blurred,  and 
people become vulnerable to those who would exploit that blurred distinction.  Although 
most  students  who  take  this  type  of  course  will  not  work  directly  in  science  or  the 
technology  industry,  they  will  constitute  the  majority  of  the  population  in  our  country. 
Their  attitudes  toward  science  will  be  reflected  in  the  public  officials  they  elect,  the 
policies  of  school  boards  on  which  they  sit,  and  the  behavior  of  corporations  that  they 
patronize.  Without  a  scientifically  literate  public,  meaningful  public  discussion  of 

 
 

 

1 

important  scientific  and  ethical  issues  will  be  virtually  impossible.    The  blurred 
distinctions between science and pseudoscience  will  lead to public  fear and opinion  not 
founded on fact. 

There  has  been  much  discussion  of  this  dilemma  at  many  levels,  and  various 
organizations  are  attempting  to  address  it.  The  Federal  Government  has  instituted  the 
National  Science  Standards  as  part  of  the  No  Child  Left  Behind  program.  On  the  state 
level,  Florida  plans  to  require  a  passing  grade  for  the  science  section  of  the  Florida 
Comprehensive Assessment Test (FCAT) as part of the graduation requirements for high 
school  students  beginning  in  2007.  At  University  of  Central  Florida  (UCF),  we  are 
making  a  concerted  effort  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  our  physical  science  course 
through the development of Physics in Films. 

 

PHYSICS IN FILMS 

 
Many  of  the  students  in  our target  audience  are  moviegoers,  some  of  them  avid 
fans. When offered an opportunity to study science in a way that includes watching films, 
they  enthusiastically  take  it.  Since  the  inception  of  the  course,  enrollment  has  swelled, 
and  its reputation on campus  has spread. The use of  movies to increase student  interest 
and performance  has proved successful  not only  in quantitative sciences (Dubeck et al., 
1981, 1990, 1995, and 1998), but also  in other disciplines  such as psychology (Badura, 
2002; Hemenover et al., 1999; Conner 1996; and Anderson, 1992). In particular, the use 
of  specially  selected  short  clips  to  illustrate  single  specific  concepts  (Badura,  2002)  is 
parallel to our approach. 
Hollywood  has  provided  a  wealth  of  examples  that  can  be  applied  to  the  topics 
 
covered  in  a  physical  science  course.  Popular  science  fiction  movies  often  include 
stunning  visual  demonstrations  of  fantastic  situations  that  can  be  analyzed  from  a 
physical  point  of  view,  and  continually  improving  special  effects  make  these  situations 
appear  more  realistic  than  ever  before.  Nevertheless,  science-teaching  opportunities  are 
not  limited  to  sci-fi.  Action  movies  are  full  of  excellent  examples  of  kinematics  and 
mechanics, and the increasingly popular comic book-inspired superhero movies combine 
the  benefits  of  the  action  and  sci-fi  genres.  Another  bountiful  resource,  and  one  that 
inspires  some  of  the  liveliest  in-class  debate,  is  the  family  of  films  that  deal  with  the 
paranormal: ghosts, magic, zombies, or the afterlife. Because of the broad range of film 
genres  that  have  scenes  that  provide  excellent  teachable  moments  but  which  appeal  to 
slightly different audiences, Physics in Films has been adapted to different genres and/or 
themes, creating different flavors of physical science that each focus on the science as it 
appears in a particular movie type.  These different flavors of Physics in Films are taught 
as different sections of the same physical science course.  
 
Fermi Problems 
 
For the physical principles  involved  in a  scene to be clearly revealed, the action 
taking  place  on  the  screen  must  be  translated  into  a  relatively  simple  problem.  A 
powerful  tool  in  the  translation  of  on-screen  action  to  a  solvable  problem  is  an 
appropriate estimate of quantities involved and then their use in a calculation. The results 
should  give  an  answer  that  is  correct,  at  least  in  order  of  magnitude,  without  going 
through  the  possibly  intimidating  details  of  the  exact  calculation.  This  method  is  often 

 

2 

called “back of the envelope” calculation or “Fermi calculation”, after the Nobel laureate 
Enrico Fermi, who was a master of the technique.  
 Learning to use the Fermi calculation technique can give the students a real sense 
 
of  empowerment.  With  it,  they  are  able  to  logically  analyze  situations  that  initially 
seemed  intractable.  Although they  may  not become  masters of the technique during the 
time they spend in the course, exposure to the method allows students to see a side of the 
scientific  method  of  which  they  may  not  have  been  aware.  The  method  of  repeated, 
increasingly accurate estimates of solutions to a problem too complex to solve directly is 
one of the most implemented tools of modern science. Our hope is that students finishing 
the course will continue to practice the use of Fermi calculations as a method of critical 
thinking in their daily lives. 
The  use  of  Fermi  problems  for  teaching  from  Hollywood  films  requires  careful 
 
selection of scenes. The scene should dramatically demonstrate a physical principle from 
the  course  curriculum.  Necessary  information  to  make  the  calculations  must  also  be 
available  from clues  in the  film. If a quantity that  is  necessary  for the calculation  is  not 
available in the context of the film, it must be one that can be estimated based on general 
knowledge. (See Efthimiou and Llewellyn, 2006b.)  
 
Some examples of scenes used in class are the crashing of the alien spaceships in 
Independence  Day,  the  cruise  ship  crashing  into  the  pier  in  Speed  II,  and  the  rotating 
space station in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Fermi calculations show scientific inaccuracies 
in the first two films.  The spaceships crash over every major city in the world with what 
would be the energy release of tens of thousands of atomic bombs, yet people celebrate 
this as a victory. The cruise ship’s deceleration, as calculated from reappearing shots of 
the ship’s speedometer over time, is only a tiny fraction of the acceleration due to gravity, 
yet  people  are  dramatically  hurled  around  the  ship.  On  the  other  hand,  the  third  film, 
2001: A Space Odyssey, realistically portrays a rotating space station creating an artificial 
gravity similar to that experienced on the surface of earth. 
 

 

Working to Alter Misconceptions 
 
In  general,  the  learning  process  can  be  derailed  in  a  variety  of  ways.  Often,  a 
student won’t learn a new concept if he or she lacks some prerequisite knowledge needed 
to  understand  the  new  concept.    This  lack  of  knowledge,  known  as  a  null  learning 
impediment, is usually easily diagnosed and remedied. The student  is completely aware 
that  he  does  not  understand,  and  by  the  student’s  own  effort  or  timely  evaluation,  the 
teacher  should  also  be  aware.    A  more  subtle  obstacle  to  learning  is  known  as  a 
substantive  learning  impediment.  Substantive  learning  impediments  occur  when  new 
ideas  are  related  to  misconceptions  present  in  the  student’s  cognitive  structure.  These 
impediments  are  more  dangerous  than  null  learning  impediments  because  they  may  go 
undetected.  The  student  believes  that  he  has  understood the  new  concept,  and  it  makes 
sense  in  the  framework  of  his  prior  knowledge.  It  may  even  deepen  his  belief  in  the 
underlying  misconception.  There  may  be  several  layers  of  misunderstanding  before 
anyone, student or teacher, realizes that there is a problem (Taber, 2001).  

As  discussed  earlier,  Hollywood  is  often  willing  to  sacrifice  scientific  accuracy 
for the sake of drama. The problem with this  is that  many people, without the tools  for 
critical  analysis,  accept  what they  see  onscreen  as  realistic  and  accurate.  They  begin  to 

 

3 

build a foundation for their understanding of the physical workings of the world around 
them  based  on  the  unrealistic  portrayals  in  popular  media,  rather  than  a  careful 
observation  of  the  real  world.    This  flawed  conceptual  framework  then  leads  to 
substantive learning impediments that are difficult to diagnose and correct. 

Many  misconceptions  are  developed  from  early  childhood  through  everyday 
experience  and  clash  with  scientific  laws  that  seem  counterintuitive  when  viewed  from 
the framework of that experience, e.g. Newton’s First Law. These everyday observation-
based misconceptions can usually be corrected by careful scientific observation and some 
understanding  of  the  factors  that  hide  the  true  behavior.  Misconceptions  learned  in  a 
social  context,  including  those  learned  while  watching  movies  and  television,  are  often 
harder  to  eliminate.  The  source  of  these  misconceptions  is  often  viewed  as  having  an 
authority greater than the student’s own observations (Qian and Guzzetti, 2000). It is our 
hope  that  students  of  Physics  in  Films,  armed  with  some  solid  knowledge  of  physical 
science and tools for applying that knowledge, will view the dramatization in films with a 
more critical eye and therefore be less susceptible to developing misconceptions. 

 
Pseudoscience 
 
Another  examination  of  the  Fermi  problem  film  scenes  discussed  earlier  reveals 
that one  film  with  action  in  good  agreement  with  physical  principles  is  2001:  A  Space 
Odyssey.  This  film  was  made  in  1969,  while  the  others  are  much  more  recent.  This 
abandonment of attention to scientific detail and, in fact, the adoption of the attitude that 
realistic  portrayals  of  scientists  and  physical  situations  are  not  dramatic  or  entertaining 
are not limited to the film industry. It has become prevalent throughout our society over 
the past several decades (Hofstadter 1998). Scientists have been increasingly portrayed as 
dull, close-minded and unimaginative or dangerous, sometimes diabolical. 

Another  trend  is  the  increasing  popularity  of  the  theme  of  the  supernatural  as 
something  very  real,  with  characters  living  otherwise  very  normal  lives  immersed  in 
activities  involving  magic  or  ghosts.  In  his  1998  commentary  in  Science,  Douglas 
Hofstadter  recounts  a  story  of  his  experience  with  his  eight-year  old  son’s  reading 
material.  The  boy  was  reading  the  Goosebumps  series.  This  series  has  done  a  great 
service in popularizing reading among young children. However, it is filled with children 
portrayed as open-minded and intelligent heroes confronting supernatural beings in which 
their  dull  and  stuffy  parents  refuse  to  believe.  Hofstadter’s  son  then  brought  home  a 
library book, another ghost story. Again, the parents in the story were skeptical, refusing 
to  attribute  the  evidence  to  ghosts.  The  children  set  out to reveal  the  truth,  and,  in  this 
story,  through  scientific  investigation  they  uncover  a  very  real  explanation  of  the 
haunting. The library book was written in the early 1960’s. The Goosebumps series was 
written in the 1990’s (Hofstadter, 1998). Similar themes occur in television and movies, 
with the heroes of the story increasingly portrayed as “enlightened,” while the scientific 
community is portrayed as the close-minded naysayers.  
Physics  in  Films  aims  to  debunk  the  increasing  prevalence  of  pseudoscientific 
 
ideas.  The  selection  of  films  with  pseudoscientific  subject  matter  is  vast,  with  many  of 
the films very recent and popular. Because the ideas are so pervasive in society, many of 
the students have strong beliefs about the topics and a deep interest in investigating them. 
The pseudoscience section of the class  is the  scene of  some of the  most heated debates 
and some of the most fervently held misconceptions.

Student Response Systems 
 
Student response systems are  interactive technologies that have recently  become 
very popular. They allow teachers to pose questions to the entire class, often as part of a 
PowerPoint presentation. The students respond using electronic keypads. The answers are 
recorded,  and  the  responses  are  immediately  available  for  display,  again  in  the 
PowerPoint presentation.  Studies have shown that the use of student response systems as 
part of the classroom interaction increases student engagement and classroom discussion, 
leading to improved understanding of the subject matter (Johnson and McLeod, 2004). 

From  its  inception,  Physics  in  Films  has  made  use  of  various  electronic  student 
response  systems.  The  systems  provide  instant  feedback  from  students  as  responses  to 
questions  posed  by  the  instructor.  This  provides  a  means  for  real  time  assessment  of 
student understanding. The statistical results of the students’ responses can be displayed 
in  a  PowerPoint  presentation  as  soon  as  the  responses  are  collected,  with  or  without 
revealing the correct answer. Revealing the correct answer gives the students immediate 
feedback on their performance and comparison of their response with the class in general. 
Display  of  the  class  response  statistics  without  the  correct  answer  indicated  allows  the 
use of the system as a polling mechanism. The results are often used as an introduction to 
discussion in smaller groups. Students are invited to debate their answers and views with 
their  neighbors.  After  the  discussion,  the  class  is  polled  again,  and  the  results  are 
displayed, this time with the correct response indicated. Sometimes polls are taken before 
and after a certain topic is studied, showing any change of opinion on the topic after it has 
been investigated scientifically. 

As pointed out by Malcolm Montgomery of the University of Cincinnati (Johnson 
and  McLeod,  2004),  the  anonymity  of  the  electronic  student  response  system  is  a  big 
advantage over simply using a show of hands when polling students. When responses to 
questions are not anonymous, students tend to follow the  first opinion expressed.  When 
responses are gathered electronically and then displayed simultaneously, all are on equal 
ground. This  brings a  much  larger range of  views to any  following discussion (Johnson 
and McLeod, 2004). 

In  addition  to  the  benefits  that  the  student  response  system  brings  to  the 
classroom,  it  is  also  helpful  with  bookkeeping.  The  system  provides  a  way  to  take 
attendance  and  measure  participation  during  the  course  of  the  lecture.  The  grades  for 
quizzes  performed  with  the  system  are  automatically  logged,  eliminating  the  need  to 
record grades later. 
 

STUDENT PERFORMANCE 

 
An internal evaluation performed on several sections of Physics in Films shows a 
marked improvement of students’ understanding of the physical science topics presented 
through the course. Pre- and post-tests consisted of a series of questions addressing topics 
covered in the specific section (“flavor”) of the course. Following each topical question, 
the  students  were  asked  to  rank  their  confidence  in  the  answer  chosen  on  a  five  point 
scale  ranging  from  “just  guessing”  to  “very  confident.”  Student  mastery  of  the  course 
material showed  not only  in the  improved percentage of correct answers on the science 
questions, but also in the dramatic shift toward the higher end of the confidence scale on 
the post-test.

Figure  1  shows  the  pre-test  and  post-test  average  scores  compared  for  four 
separate  sections  taught  by  three  different  instructors.  All  sections  show  significant 
improvement, with the average score in the 2004 Pseudoscience section almost doubling 
by  the  end  of  the  course.  Figure  2  shows  the  shift  of  the  students’  confidence  level  in 
their choice of answers. The numbers are taken  from the confidence  levels recorded for 
all questions on the tests given in three different sections.

pseudoscience  sections.  The  2005  action/adventure  section  had  a  16.1%  increase  in 
scores  from  pre-test to  post-test,  and  a  confidence  gain  of  0.263.  Figures  3-5  show  the 
pre-test to post-test shift of students’ confidence in their answers for these two sections of 
the  pseudoscience  flavor  and  one  section  of  the  action/adventure  flavor.  The  more 
striking improvement shown in the scores from the pseudoscience section may be partly 
due  to  the  slightly  more  mathematical  nature  of  the  action/adventure  subject  matter, 
which  uses  mathematical  formulae  more  heavily.  The  pseudoscience  class  is  directed 
more at considering possible physical  explanations of supernatural phenomena. Another 
possibility  for  the  disparity  between  the  flavors  is  the  strong  student  interest  in  the 
pseudoscience topics coming into the class.

Student Performance: Specific Examples 
 
 The general goal of the physical science class and Physics in Films in particular, 
is  to  increase  the  scientific  literacy  of  a  population  of  students  unlikely  to  pursue 
knowledge of the subject outside of the context of class. Figures 6-11 are illustrations of 
class  performances  on  the  pre-test  and  post-test  for  specific  questions.  The  questions 
probe  students’  understanding  of  some  basic  concepts,  ideas,  and  principles  of  science 
and the scientific method. 
 
Figure 6 demonstrates that most of the class has grasped the concept of heat flow, 
with  a  post-test  score  of  nearly  80%  while  the  pre-test  answers  were  scattered.  After 
completing the course, 90% of the class knows that four fundamental forces are at work 
in  the  Universe,  as  shown  in  Figure  7.  Understanding  of  the  underlying  cause  of  the 
everyday  phenomenon  friction,  demonstrated  in  Figure  8,  indicates  an  increased  ability 
and  willingness  to  look  deeper  into  experiences  usually  taken  for  granted.  Even  on 
questions that require the understanding of some mathematics as an abstract expression of 
a  physical  law,  demonstrated  in  Figure  9  with  a  question  concerning  Newton’s  second 
law,  the  class  shows  strong  improvement.  This  ability  to  handle  some  of  the 
mathematical abstraction of physics is one example of the students’ better understanding 
of  how  science  works.  Another  is  demonstrated  in  Figure  10,  where  students  identify 
fields that make use of the scientific method.

Addressing Misconceptions 

One of the most important steps in developing scientific literacy is the addressing 
of  misconceptions.  As  detailed  previously,  these  misconceptions  can  come  from  many 
different sources, and the source of a particular misconception will often determine how 
hard  it  is  to  change.  Figures  11-14  show  class  scores  on  questions  addressing  specific 
common misconceptions. 

The origin of the elements that make up the world around us was misunderstood 
by  many  of  the  students  before  taking  the  class.  After  completion  of  Physics  in  Films, 
over 80% of the class knew that the elements were all created  inside  stars, as shown  in 
Figure  11.  Some  of  the  most  prevalent  misconceptions  involve  supernatural  events  or 
activities.  One  common  myth,  often  presented  as  a  scientifically  proven  fact  in  popular 
media, is that the temperature of a room will drop in the presence of a ghost. On the pre-
test,  a  significant  number  of  students  believed  this  myth.  After  possible  physical 
explanations  for  the  observed  “ghost  induced”  temperature  changes  were  discussed  in 
class,  the  majority  of  the  original  believers  were  more  skeptical  on  the  post-test.  The 
students also seemed to have a better understanding of the scientific concept of proof by 

 

10 

the  time  that  they  took  the  post-test.  This  is  demonstrated  in  Figure  12.  Hypnosis  is 
another  metaphysical  topic  often  accepted  by  students.  Following  a  section  of  the 
pseudoscience flavor, which includes as reading material two exposés about psychics and 
magicians,  most  of  the  class  were  able  to  look  for  a  physical  explanation  behind 
magicians’ tricks. This is demonstrated in Figure 13. Another example of understanding 
that science  is a  search  for a  logical, physical  explanation  for any  phenomenon that we 
encounter is demonstrated in Figure 14 which shows student responses to a question on 
science and extrasensory perception. 
 

All known elements on Earth were made …

A. on Earth by natural 

processes.
B. inside comets.
C. inside stars.
D. on Mars and captured by 
Earth via its gravitational 
attraction.

E. inside other planets.

STUDENT REACTIONS 

Several  groups  of  students  from  different  sections  of  Physics  in  Films  were 
 
interviewed following their completion of the course. The interviews were conducted by 
an  independent  party,  the  Research  Initiative  for  Teaching  Effectiveness  (RITE) office, 
which has been established by UCF to support faculty in formulating and implementing 
research  on  effective  teaching  practices  in  higher  education.  The  students  were  asked 
questions about various aspects of their experience in Physics in Film, their views of the 
subject  of  science,  and  their  previous  experience  in  the  physical  science  class.  The 
following excerpts  illustrate the students’ thoughts about the use of the  films to convey 
science  concepts  in the class and their attitudes about movies after taking the  class; the 
students’  feelings  about  the  use  of  the  electronic  response  system  in  the  class;  and  the 
students’ overall reaction to the format of Physics in Films. 
 
The use of films as a teaching tool 

 

13 

These first excerpts from five group interviews show the students’ opinions on the 
 
effectiveness  of  the  films  as  a  method  of  communicating  the  science  concepts.  Along 
with several comments about the films keeping students’ attention better than lecture and 
watching  movies  a  preferable  form  of  homework,  a  couple  of  students  mention  that 
learning the concepts as illustrated in films makes them easier to remember.  
 
Group 1 
What did you like best about the class? 
 

-  The movies 

 
Talk to me about the movies a little bit – did you feel like they helped the instruction at 
all? Was that of value to the class? 
 

-  A good supplement 
- 

It’s like, you know the class will watch movies, we’ll do our homework, we’ll 
come and discuss it and he talks about what happens in the movie and whether or 
not that’s physically possible, due to science and all that. So it helps you 
understand better. 
I was more interested because I’d rather spend 2 hrs watching a movie than spend 
2 hrs reading a textbook because then I can pull things from the movie instead of 
trying to go back and remember what I just read because… I just, it’s not as 
interesting. 

- 

 
Do you think it helps you understand the physics concepts he was talking about, using the 
movies? 
 

-  Well, yeah, especially if you’re a learner that learns more by demonstration 

instead of just reading a fact and trying to put it together. It helps a lot more to see 
it in the movie or to pull back from that instead of just reading the text.  

 
Group 2 
How did you think the films worked in the class? 
 

-  Personally, I think it was so much better. Like, I’ve taken this class before, I took  
it in the spring and I failed it. And I took it with Professor [name omitted], and as  
far as I know, the class average in the class was a D. And I don’t think it’s even 
close to that right now. I mean, not to say I enjoy the subject of physics, I would 
never major in it in my life, but it’s a much easier course, and I’ve learned a lot 
more the way it’s taught with the films. 
 

-  Yeah, I liked it too, because like, it’s one thing for them to talk about a subject, 

but watching a movie kind of like reinforces information that he’s talking about. I 
mean, he could just talk to us and we can like, imagine, but if we’re watching, 

Group 3 

 

14 

like, a movie, and actually see what he’s talking about, it makes it, like, better for 
us to understand. Like a visual.  

 
So it helped you understand physics concepts, or ideas that he was talking about in class.  
 

-  Yeah. Because we can actually see it. So it makes it easier to understand. 

 
Group 4 
Did you think using the movies and the clips, did that help you learn physics better or 
help you understand the concepts he was talking about? 
 

-  Yeah, it helped with paying attention.  
-  Yeah, it’s not just a lecture, you get to see movies that aren’t that boring – they’re 

normal movies and they’re nice so… 

 
Group 5 
Did you – do you think that having as physics in films – what’s your opinion on using the 
films to help you? 
 

I think it’s kind of unique. 

- 
-  Yeah, I like it that way because I took physical science in the spring, and I felt 

that I couldn’t, you know, picture it, anything, and you know, the professor wrote 
the book as well, as well so it was like, no help, but like with this one, you can 
kind of you know, talk about a theory, and then once you’re watched the film you 
can like, relate it and you can actually remember it, so I liked it. 

These three excerpts deal with students’ approach to watching films after taking 

 
Watching movies after Physics in Films 
 
the class. One concern has been that learning to watch more analytically will decrease the 
enjoyment of movies in the future. The students in these interviews did not seem to feel 
that they had lost anything. 
 
Group 1 
Do you find that you look at films differently now because of… 
 

-  Yeah 
- 

I also, like, usually I just follow the storyline and don’t think twice, but now,  
when it comes to the paranormal and stuff like that, I’ll kind of think twice, I’ll be  
like “Wait a minute,” say “that doesn’t coincide with reality.” I mean, a lot of  
movies don’t, but I’m a little bit more skeptical now when I do watch a movie. 

 
Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 
 

-  For me it’s a good thing, because when you watch a movie you believe 

everything, you know? And you’re like, you go with what they are telling you. 

 

15 

And now you’re like… the movie is this… it doesn’t go with the beginning. And 
now you analyze this, and don’t get like, emotional. 

 
You’re just thinking more about the movie? 
 

 
You can’t just enjoy the movie now. 
 

- 

I don’t think it takes away from it though. I think that it might be some people’s 
concerns, that it will take away from when you watch the movie.  

-  Well you can though. You know, I enjoyed every movie I watched, even though I 
thought about it a little more now. It’s still, you know, the same movie. You just 
think about it differently.  

 
Group 2 
Do you find, since you’ve used movies this whole semester, like, do you look at movies 
differently now when you go to the movies to watch them? Did this class change how you 
watch movies? 
 

- 

It shows you how fictional a lot of the movies are and how they come across as 
truth, but it’s really not.  

 
So you look at them more critically? 
 

-  Yeah.  
-  Yeah, you see the flaws.  
-  You analyze them more.  

 
Did it ruin your movie-going experience or not really? 
 

-  No. 
 
Group 3 
Do you think now that you’ve looked at films in a different way, does that affect the way 
you watch movies? 
 

-  Yes. Because it makes you think you look smarter now. 
-  Yeah, when you watch scary movies, you’re kind of not that scared because you 

know it could never happen. It’s pretty cool. 

 
Is that a good thing or a bad thing? 
 

-  No, it’s a good thing. Because I used to get pretty scared. Yeah, and now I’m like, 

“Alright, cool.” Now it’s just entertaining, it’s not scary anymore. 

 
So you don’t loose the entertainment in the movies? 

 

16 

 

-  No, not at all. 
-  No. 

 
Student views on the use of electronic response systems in the class 
 
The  anonymity  in  answering  questions  was  appreciated.  Some  students  felt  the 
use  of  the  system  to  keep  an  attendance  record  helped  them  keep  up  their  attendance. 
Other  students  appreciated  the  extra  credit  offered  for  correct  responses  and  used  the 
questions as review for their tests. They also commented that putting some value on the 
responses  made  them  take  answering  seriously.  One  group  mentioned  the  use  of  the 
system  to  show  changing  class  opinions  on  topics  during  the  lecture.  One  student 
resented  being  interrupted  and  having  to  “think  about”  the  material  during  the  lecture. 
Although  he  may  not  have  liked  being  forced  to  think  during  an  8:00  am  lecture,  his 
comments may actually be a favorable review for the system. 
 
Anonymity 
Did you think his using them to ask questions, did that help you at all in the class? 
 

I like that so much better. 
It’s so much better than him just randomly picking someone because it’s just like, 
kind of anonymous, so you don’t feel really stupid if you get it wrong because 
nobody has any idea if you got it wrong. 

-  And it helps with the midterm – there’s times I think I understand concepts and 

then I’ll get the question totally wrong, and he’ll re-explain it and I’ll understand 
it better. 

- 
- 

 

Attendance 
Did you think it was worthwhile to use that though? I mean he asked you questions in 
class? 
 

It made me go to class. 

- 
-  Yeah.  
-  Honestly, yeah. 
- 
-  And it’s good for studying because you know those are like, kind of like, the 

It counts as attendance, so. 

questions that he’s gonna ask on the test. So it’s like, good to see. 

 
Extra credit and test review 
The second ones, once the worked, he used it for attendance, but also did he ask you 
questions? 
 

I liked that. I don’t know if I’m the only one. 

-  Yeah. 
- 
-  No, I liked the questions too. 
- 

I liked the questions and how you can get the extra credit if you do the questions, 
so it makes you want to stay there and actually do the questions. 

 

17 

-  See I would have started writing down the questions if I had known they were 

review for the test. 

-  Yeah, they prepared you. 

 
Are the questions, they’re extra credit, or… 
 

-  No, they’re part of the attendance grade and part of the grade, but if you answer – 

I think it’s 75% right, you get 5% extra credit – which I think is, it’s a big 
motivator to do it – stay the whole class. 
It’s like the questions are taking attendance because if you answer a question then 
they know you’re there. And it also, it motivates you to think – because if it 
wasn’t for extra credit, and just for attendance, you know, I’m sure half the people 
wouldn’t really think about the question. 

-  They’d just push a button. 
  

Polling for class opinions 
Now he – the way the keypad works is he actually gets the recording of all the students’ 
responses? 
 

-  Yeah. 
- 

It comes up on a bar graph of the right answer, and how, like the percentage of 
who got it right. The questions are like 1-5, and how many people like answered 
1-5.  
I like how he showed the percentages, because it was interesting when like, he’d 
ask, “Do you believe in ghosts?” and then you’d see how many people in the class 
actually do believe in ghosts. 

-  And then he’ll go through the lecture and he’ll ask the question again and see how 

it changes. 

Keeping attention 
You didn’t like the keypads? 
 

-  No.  

I don’t know, I just didn’t really – I mean I kind of saw the point… But I was just, 
they were just kind of a burden because you’re just sitting there and the lecture’s 
flowing, you know, and you’re getting interested and then all of sudden you just 
kind of have to stop and answer a question and think about it, and then get back 
on to the lecture.  

The  success  of  Physics  in  Films  to  this  point  has  been  encouraging.  The 
popularity of the course has been steadily increasing as its reputation on campus grows. 
The  course  offers  a  very  attractive  alternative  to  the  standard  physical  science  class 

CONCLUSION

available  to  our  target  audience.  Student  performance  in  the  class  has  been  good,  and 
student  reaction  to  the  class  has  been  favorable.  Our  hope  is  that  the  Physics  in  Films 
method  of  covering  the  material  has  yielded  a  group  of  students  with  a  deeper 
understanding and better retention of the ideas. The evidence so far suggests that the goal 
is being met. Further testing, for a direct comparison with the students taking the standard 
physical science class, is needed to confirm this. If the method is successful in improving 
the  science  literacy  of  an  at  risk  population,  it  could  be  a  valuable  tool  in  creating  a 
general public with a good exposure to science.

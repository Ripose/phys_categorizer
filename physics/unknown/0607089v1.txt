Abstract 

We  suggest  that  it  might  be  possible  to  trap  the  electron  in  a  cavity  of  a 

macrocycle  molecule,  in  the  same  way  this  trapping  occurs  cooperatively,  by  several 

solvent  molecules,  in  hydroxylic  liquids.  Such  an  encapsulated  electron  is  a  ‘molecular 

capacitor,’ in which the excess electron is largely decoupled from valence electrons in the 

trap. A specific design for such a trap that is based on calix[4]cyclohexanol is discussed 

in  detail.  It  is  shown  theoretically,  by  ab  initio  and  density  functional  theory  (DFT) 

modeling, that one of the conformations of this molecule forms the optimum tetrahedral 

trap  for  the  electron.  The  resulting  ‘encapsulated  electron’  strikingly  resembles  the 

solvated electron in alcohols and water.

1. Introduction 

In  hydroxylic  liquids  and  amorphous        solids,  such  as  water  (ice)  and  alcohols, 

the  excess  electron  (known  as  ‘solvated’  or  ‘trapped’  electron)  occupies  a  small  cavity 

formed  by  4-8  polar  solvent  molecules.  [1-4]  This  state  is  stabilized  by  attraction  to 

several  OH  groups  pointing  towards  the  center  of  the  cavity  and  repulsion  by  hydroxyl 

protons via the Pauli exclusion. Our recent results [5,6] suggest that this familiar picture 

of the solvated/trapped electron might be incomplete: in addition to the electron density 

inside the cavity, there is a substantial (ca. 18% for hydrated electron, 

hyde

 [5]) density in 

the O 2p orbitals of the oxygen atoms in the solvating OH groups. Despite this sharing, 

the excess electron is largely decoupled from valence electrons in the solvent molecules. 

The resulting structure is perhaps the closest approximation to ‘a particle in a box’ that 

one comes across in a chemical system. This particular ‘box’ is the smallest possible for a 

molecular  system:  e.g.,  in  water,  the  cavity  is  less  than  5  Å  in  diameter.  Due  to  the 

relative  isolation  of  the  excess  electron  from  the  solvent  molecules  (including  the 

magnetic  nuclei  in  these  molecules),  solvated  electrons  exhibit  very  long  times  of  spin 

dephasing,  even  at  room  temperature  (microseconds).  In  this  regard,  the  solvated 

electrons  appear  to  be  superior  to  other  embodiments  of  nanoscale  ‘boxes’  (e.g. 

semiconductor quantum dots) suggested for, inter alia, quantum computing which often 

exhibit short decoherence times, even at low temperature (nanoseconds at 4 K).  

Experiments on electron trapping by self-assembled clusters of alcohol molecules 

in  liquid  hydrocarbon  solvents  [7]  and  alkane  glasses  suggest  that  three  or  four  OH 

groups are already sufficient to bind the electron at ca. 0.8 eV below the conduction band 

of the solvent; the absorption spectra of electrons trapped by such clusters are also very 

similar  to  those  observed  for  solvated  electrons  in  neat  alcohols.  Importantly,  the 

equilibrium fraction of such tetramer electron traps in the reaction mixture might be small 

yet  such  H-bonded  clusters  are  the  only  deep  traps  for  the  electron  in  these  binary 

solutions.  According  to  electron  spin  echo  envelope  modulation  (ESEEM)  studies  of 

Kevan  et  al.  [8]  the  mean  coordination  number  for  the  trapped  electron  in  low 

temperature  ethanol  glass  is  four.  Electron  nuclear  double  resonance  (ENDOR) 

spectroscopy  of  electrons  trapped  by  single  crystals  of  carbohydrates  (such  as  sucrose) 

 

2 

-
indicates that either two OH groups or, more likely, two magnetically equivalent sets of 

such OH groups stabilize the excess negative charge. [9] The recent ab initio and density 

functional  theory  (DFT)  calculations  also  indicate  that  four  non-H-bonding  hydroxyl 

groups  suffice  for  trapping  the  electron  in  the  interior  of  a  water  cluster  of  20-24 

molecules;  [10]  the  remaining  water  molecules  serve  as  ‘dielectric  continuum’  and 

provide an H-bond network that fixes the four solvating molecules in the orientation that 

facilitates electron trapping by dangling OH groups (see below).   

These  considerations  suggests  that  four  OH  groups  arranged  on  the  tetrahedral 

pattern  would  form  a  sufficiently  deep  trap  for  electron  binding.  In  hydroxylic  solvents 

and clusters, such arrangements are the result of fortuitous orientation of fluctuating OH 

dipoles.  However,  a  suitably  designed  (semi-)rigid  single  molecule  that  has  an  internal 

cavity  resembling  the  tetrahedral  electron-trapping  cavity  in  these  hydroxylic  solvents 

should  also  be  suitable.  Such  a  molecule  would  trap  (‘encapsulate’)  the  electron  in  the 

same  fashion  that  several  molecules  cooperatively  trap  it  in  polar  liquids  and  crystals. 

The resulting anion would hold the excess negative charge primarily in its cavity, where 

the electron wavefunction is minimally perturbed by the electrons in the molecule. Such 

an anion would be the chemical realization of a ‘particle in a box,’ thereby constituting 

the ultimate in the miniaturization of a capacitor. Below we suggest a specific design for 

such a molecule that is based on perhydrogenated calix[4]arenes. 

 

2. Calix[2]cyclohexanol. 

The  synthesis  of  RsS  SsR  RsS  SsR  calix[4]cyclohexanol  (1,  Figure  1a)  has  been 

given by Biali and co-workers. [11] This macrocycle is a ring of cyclohexanol molecules 

connected  by  methylene  linkages.  This  macrocycle  is  obtained  by  hydrogenation  of  the 

parent  compound,  calix[4]arene.  In  a  crystal, 

the  molecule  assumes  a  ‘cone’ 

conformation (similar to that of the parent compound) with four OH groups lying in the 

same plane forming a closed ring (Figure 1a); these OH groups are held in the ring by H-

bonds  (the  O-O  distance,  2.71  Å  is  close  to  such  a  distance  in  Ih  ice,  2.77  Å).  Such  H-

bonded rings cannot trap the electron, as suggested by ab initio and DFT calculations for 

 

3 

tetramers  of  hydroxylic  molecules  [12]  and  our  calculations  for  cone  conformer  1. 

However, in solution 1 constantly undergoes cone-to-cone inversion through the annulus 

of  the  cone,  by  concerted  rotation  around  four  methylene  groups.  At  100  oC,  this  ring 

inversion  may  be  observed  directly  using  NMR,  via  the  exchange  of  ‘inward’  and 

‘outward’ pointing methine protons; the inversion barrier is ca. 1 eV. [11] At the outset of 

the  inversion,  the  H-bound  ring  of  the  four  OH  bonds  is  broken  and  two  cyclohexanol 

rings  flip  below  the  mid  plane,  yielding  conformer  2  (Figure  1b)  in  which  the  four 

hydroxyl groups are at the corners of a tetrahedron. We believe that this C2v symmetrical 

conformer  will  be  shown  to  trap  electrons,  yielding  radical  anion  2,-  that  strongly 

resembles  the  solvated  electron  in  alcohols  and  water.  The  electron  is  expected  to  be 

attached to 2 in the same fashion it can be attached to a cluster of alcohol molecules, [6,7] 

i.e.,  by  dispersal  of  the  electron  trap  in  a  polar  (e.g.,  hexamethylphosphoramid)  [13]  or 

nonpolar  (alkane)  [6]  liquid/solid  with  very  low  binding  energy  for  the  excess  electron. 

The  solvated/quasifree  electron,  that  is  generated  photo-  or  radio-  lytically,  in  such 

solvents rapidly descends into the  traps. [6,7] 

3. Computational Details 

The electronic structure of 2- was studied computationally using a self-consistent 

field  Hartree-Fock  (HF)  model  and  a  DFT  model  with  B3LYP  functional  (Becke's 
exchange functional [14] and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang, and Parr) [15] from 
Gaussian  98.  [16]  The  basis  set  was  a  6-31G  split-valence  double-z

  Gaussian  set 

augmented  with  diffuse  and  polarized  (d,p)  functions  (6-31+G**  or  6-311++G**).  In 

some calculations, this basis set was augmented with additional diffuse functions [10] for 

the four hydroxyl groups (this set is abbreviated as 6-31(OH1+)+G** in the following).  

Isodensity  maps  for  the  singly  occupied  molecular  orbital  (SOMO)  indicate  that 

the electron wavefunction inside the cavity and in the frontier p-orbitals of oxygen atoms 

 

 

4 

have opposite signs. Plotting the isodensity contour maps of the SOMO for progressively 

increasing amplitudes helps to visualize these two contributions (as shown in Figure 2). 
For 2-, the diffuse, positive part of the SOMO occupies 90% of the geometrical cavity at 
≈0.53  Å  is  the 

- 3   and  10%  at  the  density  of  +0.11  a0

the  density  of  +0.05  a0

- 3   (where  a0

atomic unit of length). The highest (negative) density is found in the frontal O 2p orbitals 

of oxygen atoms of the four hydroxyl groups. The total spin density in the O 2p orbitals 

was defined as explained  in ref. [5].  

3. Results and Discussion 

Isodensity maps of the SOMO shown in Figure 2 suggest that most of the electron 

density is inside the  cavity  and in the frontal O 2p orbitals of the four hydroxyl  groups 

forming  the  cavity.  These  SOMO  maps  may  be  compared  with  the  maps  for  geometry 
optimized D2d symmetrical  (

 and  (

and  3b,  respectively,  that  exhibit  the  same  structural  motif,  and  to  large  water  cluster 
anions (e.g., 24-mer 512 62 B anion of Herbert and co-workers [10]) that trap the electron 

internally  in  their  central  cavities  (Figure  3c).  At  the  B3LYP/6-311+G**  level,  all  of 

these  cluster  anions  have  ca.  10%  of  the  spin  density  in  the  O  2p  orbitals,  despite  the 

considerable  variation  in  the  cavity  size 

  (defined  as  the  mean  distance  to  the 

XHr

hydrogens in the solvating OH groups measured from the center of gravity of the SOMO, 
Table 1). For 2-,  XHr

 is only 1.35 Å (B3LYP models) or 1.55 Å (HF models) vs. 1.8-2.2 

Å  obtained  for  these  model  clusters.  In  mixed  quantum/classical  molecular  dynamics 

(QC/MD)  models  of 

hyde

,  the  most  probable 

XHr

  distances  are  2.0-2.2  Å.  [3,5]  For 

electrons trapped in alkaline glasses, this distance is 2-2.1 Å, [17,18] in ethanol glass, ca. 

2.2 Å [8], in carbohydrate crystals (dulcitol, arabinose, sucrose, etc.) - between 1.59 and 

1.82 Å. [9]  

Figure 4 shows the  angle average radial component of the SOMO density  for 2- 

geometry  optimized  using  the  B3LYP/6-31(OH1+)+G**  model.  The  most  probable 

location of the electron is inside the cavity (at

) are 1.17 Å x 1.47 Å x 1.47 Å (vs. 1.48 

Å x 1.58 Å x 1.69 Å for 

 [5]) i.e., the isodensity surfaces of the electron wavefunction 

hyde

are,  to  a  first  approximation,  oblate  ellipsoids.  The  cavity  (that  is,  the  sphere  of  radius 

XHr

hyde

) contains ca. 40% of the unpaired electron density (vs. ca. 60% in 

hyde

 [5]), and the 

negative  lobes  of  the  frontal  O  2p  orbitals  contain  ca.  26%  of  the  density  (vs.  12%  for 

); the total population of these orbitals is ca. 30% (vs. 18% for 

hyde

).  Thus, although 

2-  has  more  anionic  character  than 

hyde

  and  30%  tighter  localization,  the  electronic 

properties  are  similar  to  those  for  solvated/trapped  electrons  in  ordinary  hydroxylic 

solvents:  the  wavefunction  is  more-or-less  hydrogenic,  and  the  cavity  is  slightly 

asymmetrical.  

A convenient way to characterize spin density distribution in a solvated electron is 

through  the  hyperfine  coupling  constants  (hfcc’s).  These  constants,  unlike  the  electron 

density profiles, can be determined directly using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) 

and  ESEEM  spectroscopies.  As  seen  from  Table  1,  cluster  anions  shown  in  Figure  3 
exhibit  large  isotropic  hfcc  on  17O  nuclei  in  the  solvating  OH  groups;  in  this  regard,  2- 

also resembles the solvated electron (e.g., for 

 the hfcc constant is ca. -15 G [5]).  The 

hyde

small  hfcc’s  for  OH  protons  in  the  DFT  models  are  due  to  the  spin  bond  polarization 

involving the O 2p orbitals: this effect almost cancels the positive contribution from the 

in-cavity wavefunction (which is in contact with these protons). In HF models, this kind 

of  compensation  does  not  occur,  and  these  models  yield  large  negative  proton  coupling 
constants  (Table  2).  [5]  Hfcc’s  for  other  magnetic  nuclei  (1H  and  13C)  are  small,  the 
largest  proton  coupling  is  for  methylene  protons  in  b- position  to  OH  groups;  this 

coupling is due to hyperconjugation to the O 2p orbital. For normal isotopic abundances, 

the estimated second moment [17] of the EPR spectrum (for DFT models, Table 2) would 

be ca. 89 G2 (vs. 21-23  G2 for 

hyde

 [5,17]); the largest contribution to this parameter is 

 

6

from the four hydroxyl protons due to their large anisotropic hfcc of ≈12.8 G (vs. ≈6 G 

for  the  six  closest  protons  in 

  [5,18]).  Due  to  the  high  symmetry  of  the  trap,  the 

hyde

powder  EPR  spectrum  is  predicted  to  exhibit  well  resolved  structure,  dominated  by  a 

pentet  of  resonance  lines  separated  by  10  G  (Figure  5).  By  contrast,  EPR  spectra  of 

solvated/trapped  electrons  are  not  resolved,  due  to  the  multiplicity  of  trapping  sites  and 
large  variation  of  1H  coupling  constants  within  a  given  site.  This  characteristic  5-line 
EPR spectrum might constitute the proof of the suggested structure for 2-.  

The estimate for the gas-phase adiabatic electron affinity 

gEA  of 2 is 120 meV (in 

the B3LYP/6-31+G** model) or 110 meV (in the B3LYP/6-31(OH1+)+G** model). In a

4. Conclusion. 

We predict that conformer 2 of calix[4]hexanol would trap electrons in essentially 
 
the same way as liquid/solid water/ice and alcohols. The resulting anion species, 2-, has a 

highly  regular,  symmetrical  structure  that  facilitates  advanced  spectroscopic  studies.  In 

hydrocarbon solutions, 2 is a deep electron trap of ca. 1 eV. The electron is well localized 

inside the tetrahedral cavity, with ca. 30% of the spin density in the O 2p orbitals of the 

four  OH  groups.  The  resulting  structure  may  be  considered  as  a  nanoscale  molecular 

capacitor  holding  the  unit  negative  charge.  Electron  encapsulation  by  macrocycles 

examined in this Letter can be viewed as further elaboration of dipole coagulation [20], 

semicontinuum  [21],  and  snowball  [22]  models  for  electron  localization  in  dispersed 

polar clusters that were developed in the 1970s.

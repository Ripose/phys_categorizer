Abstract   

In  this  paper  we  show  that  1-electron  properties  such  as  Compton  profiles  and  structure 

factors  of  crystals  can  be  asymptotically  retrieved  through  cluster-based  calculations, 

followed  by  an appropriate partition  of the 1-electron reduced density matrix (1RDM). This 

approach,  conceptually  simple,  is  checked  with  respects  to  both  position  and  momentum 

spaces  simultaneously  for  insulators  and  a  covalent  crystal.  Restricting  the  calculations  to 

small  clusters  further  enables  a  fair  description  of  local  correlation  effects  in  ionic 

compounds,  which  improves  both  Compton  profiles  and  structure  factors  vs.  their 

experimentally determined counterparts.  

Keywords:  Compton  profiles,  structure  factors,  pseudo  atom,  density  matrix,  clusters, 

 

correlation.

I. Introduction 

Electron  correlation,  and  its  effect  on  cohesive  properties,  has  been  a  subject  of 

constant  research  during  the  last  decades1.  The  development  of  density  functional  theory 

(DFT)  constitutes  a  major  progress  in  this  field2.  However,  it  can  sometimes  be  misleading 

since  based  on  the  only  charge  density 

:  momentum  space  properties  are  for  instance 

(cid:1) (cid:2)r(cid:1)

driven by the non-diagonal part of the exactly N-representable 1RDM2. Given the arbitrariness 

of Kohn-Sham orbitals for considerations in momentum space, it is more convenient to deal 

with an N-representable 1RDM.  

The question is then: « how can we simulate in a simple manner an ion or a molecule 

in  a  solid  medium  at  correlated  level,  with  a  model  valid  in  both   position  and  momentum 

spaces (i.e., R and P-spaces)?  ». A previously elaborated model, based on repeated clusters3, 

turned  out  to  be  efficient  for  simple  ionic  compounds3,31.  However,  such  a  model  is  rather 

difficult to extend to complex systems. We therefore propose another approach in which we 

make  use  of  N-representable  1RDMs  and  standard  ab  initio  codes.  One  very  common 

possibility relies on performing cluster-based calculations, though the correlation problem for 

insulators and semi-conductors can be handled in many different ways4,5,6. A cluster approach 

might indeed lead to a charge density at the center of the cluster that is close to the crystal one 

but  it  cannot  permit,  however,  to  isolate  the  momentum  density  characteristic  of  that  of  the 

solid, due to surface effects. Therefore, we make use of a simple partition scheme in order to 

ovoid  this  shortcoming  (section  II).  We  show  in  the  third  section  that,  when  restricting  at 

Hartree-Fock (HF) level, the results converge towards crystal ones for some insulators and for 

silicon.  Using  small  clusters  further  allows  for  a  fair  estimation  of  local  correlation  effects 

(section  IV)  in  both  LiH  and  MgO  crystals.  The  correlation  corrections  are  consistent  with 

experimental deviations to HF Compton profiles and structure factors.

This  partition  scheme  is,  so  far,  nothing  else  than  a  Mulliken-like  partition  scheme. 

Dropping  the  explicit  dependence  on

where  R  stands  for  (r  +  r’)/2  and  s  is  the  difference  vector  r  -  r’.  Other  partition  schemes 

could obviously result in a 1-center decomposition of the 1RDM similar to (3).

Practically,  two-center  contributions  in  (2)  decrease  as  overlaps  between  orbitals 

become negligible. For an insulator AB with NaCl-like structure, two cluster calculations can 

be performed for both A and B ions, each located at the center of its corresponding cluster, in 

order  to  preserve  the  local  symmetry  of  the  environment.  Electronic  densities  can  then  be 

recovered by summing the contributions of each central ion:

For finite cluster expansion, this method is obviously only approximate but we shall see that 

in the case of LiH, MgO and Si, the 1-electron properties converge towards the crystal ones, 

calculated with the Crystal95 program package10 at HF level.  

The  CPM  should  be  efficient,  though  approximate,  for  systems  where  electron 

delocalization  effects  remain  moderate.  As  a  molecular-like  approach,  it  bypasses  the 

summation  over  the  first  Brillouin  zone:  no  periodicity  of  the  system  is  needed.  As such, it 

also  permits  investigations  of  defects,  provided  that  an  appropriate  partition  scheme  for  the 

1RDM  is  available.  Moreover,  using  electronic  structure  calculation  codes  such  as 

 

4

Gaussian9411  further  allows  for  calculations  with  explicitly  correlated  wave  functions. 

Besides, CPM turned out to be particularly efficient for molecular solids such as Ice Ih

12.  

III. Convergence of the CPM 

First,  we  examine  the  case  of  MgO  ionic  clusters.  Calculations  are  performed  on 

clusters of 27 ions (figure 1, including third shell of neighbors), surrounded by point charges 

that ensure electrical neutrality. Basis-sets used here are these developed by Harrison and co-

workers13,14,15,16 (i.e. 8411G* for O and 8511G* for Mg). Differences obtained for the isotropic 

Compton profile between cluster and Crystal95 approaches are not visible at the scale of the 

plot (figure 2). CPM anisotropies also compare favorably: they further are in close agreement 

with  experimental  ones  measured  by  Fluteaux  et  al17,18  (see  an  example  on  figure  3).  The 

relative  error  on  the  total  electronic  population  is  about  0.015%.  Tests  have  also  been 

performed  with  CaO  clusters,  for  which  both  anisotropies  and  isotropic  profiles  have  been 

found to be very close to Crystal95 ones. 

Mg2+  and  O2-  form  relatively  well  closed-shell  systems,  the  long-range  electrostatic 

influence  of  which  can  be  fairly  recovered  from  point  charges.  Conversely,  the  case  of  LiH 

gives  rise  to  strong  overlaps  occurring  between  distant  anions.  We therefore need to extend 

the cluster size up to the ninth shell of neighbors to achieve convergence. The small number 

of  electrons  involved  enables  such  cluster  calculations  at  HF  level  and  with  the  basis-set 

recommended by Dovesi19. Clusters are again neutralized using point charges. We can check 

the convergence of the value J(0), usually very sensitive to the level of theory chosen, for the 

[100] and [110] directions on table 1. The anisotropy J[100] - J[110] still better reveals the slow 

convergence  of  LiH  profiles (figure  4)  with  the  cluster  size.  Mulliken  populations  obtained 

are  compared  in  table  2,  as  well  as  kinetic  energies  (referring  to  one  LiH  cell)  which differ 

from less than 0.05%.

The  usual  approach  for  cluster-based  calculations  on  covalent  crystals  is  to  saturate 

periphery  bonds  with  hydrogen  atoms20.  In  the  case  of  silicon,  both  Si-H  distances  and  H 

orbital  exponents  can  be  optimized  in  order  to  provide  quasi-exact  density-matrix  elements 

for central Si atoms (Si-H optimized distances vary around 1.6 Å, depending on the basis-set 

chosen). We have checked that an HF/8-41G calculation on Si5H12 partitioned cluster already 

result in static structure factors  close to Crystal95 ones21 (relative errors remaining less than 

0.6%). The agreement becomes almost perfect when extending the cluster to Si35H36 (table 3).  

IV. Local correlation effects on ionic compounds 

Comparing  experimental  and  computed  HF  Compton  profiles  in  MgO  and  LiH 

crystals,  a  significant  isotropic  discrepancy  occurs.  These  effects  remain  with  different 

experiments22 and within different basis-set calculations17,31 (see figures 5 and 6). Furthermore, 

the observed deviations to isotropic HF profiles show opposite trends for both compounds.  

Assuming  that  correlation  effects  are  mainly  local23  (i.e.  intra-ionic),  we  investigate 

small clusters. Hence, the following correlation profiles (cid:1)JCorr = JCluster/Corr– JCluster /HF originate 

from  clusters  of  7  ions  (

δ
1 BA

A

6

δ

B

-like  clusters)  embedded  in  a  Madelung  field  and  are 

compared  to  the  observed  deviation  (cid:1)JExp  =  JExp  –  JCrystal95/HF.  Small  clusters  enable 

calculations at correlated level. Dovesis’s basis-set has been extended with optimized s and p 

functions  for  Li  and  H,  whereas  we  kept  Harrisson’s  basis-set  in  the  case  of  MgO.  In  each 

case,  the  contribution  of  periphery  ions  to  the  Compton  profile  is  averaged,  which  will  be 

hereafter  reminded  through  the  notation: 

A

δ
1 B

δ

B

.  The  correlation  profiles  (cid:1)JCorr  thus 

refer  to  either  4  or  20  electrons  (respectively  for  LiH  or  MgO).  We  expect  to  catch  part  of 

anion-anion correlation effects through calculations on A1

(cid:1)+B6

(cid:1)--like clusters. 

For  LiH,  calculations  are  performed  at  QCISD11  level  on  both  Li1H6  and  H1Li6 

clusters, respectively centered on Li+ and H-. The two resulting correlation profiles appear on 

 

6

figure  7  and  are  compared  to  the  experimental  one3.  The  experimental  deviation  shown  is 

multiplied by 0.525 in order to match the residual amplitude of deviations found by Bellaiche 

and  Lévy24,  after  correction  for  both  impulse  approximation  and  multiple  scattering.  Error 

bars refer to statistical errors. 

Notice  that  the  transfer  of  one  electron  from  Li  to  H  forms  a  paired  couple,  the 

correlation  energy  of  which  participates  to  the  cohesion  mechanism.  The  experimental 

cohesion energy was estimated25 to 0.18 atomic units (a.u.) vs. 0.13 a.u. from HF calculation. 

The  difference  (0.05  u.a.)  is  of  the  order  of  the  usually  expected correlation energies for  an 

isolated single pair of electrons26 ((cid:2) 0.04 a.u.). For a qualitative comparison, we estimated the 

correlation kinetic energy (QCISD – HF) of anionic electrons from a Mulliken partition: they 

were  found  to  be  0.04  and  0.03  a.u.  for  Li1(cid:3)H6(cid:4)  and  H1(cid:3)Li6(cid:4)  clusters,  respectively.  The 

difference might be attributed to electron correlation between anions. These values approach 

the  expected  one  (which  should  not  exceed  0.05  a.u.,  through  the  Virial  theorem).  In 

comparison,  the  experimental  deviation  to  HF  isotropic  profile of LiH  widely  overestimates 

the correlation kinetic energy (this will be discussed in section V).  

The theoretical correlation profiles show however the same trend as the experimental 

deviation, that is, (cid:1)JCorr (0) < 0 and as such, are not characteristic of these of 2-electron free 

ions.  Restoring  the  basis-set  to  the  original  Dovesi’s  one  enables  calculations  on  larger 

clusters,  which  confirmed  this  conclusion,  although  theoretical  correlation  profiles  exhibit 

smaller magnitudes. In each case, correlation does not bring appreciable corrections to charge 

transfer. Rather, the correlation profiles found for LiH suggest a preferred angular correlation 

mechanism  to  be  dealt  with  in  a  forthcoming  paper27.  Since  angular  correlation  enables 

electrons to get closer to the nucleus, it reduces the size of the anion, which is consistent with 

the often-mentioned HF overestimation of anionic radii in LiH5.  

 

7

A  similar  approach  has  been  used  for  MgO:  we  report  on  figure  8  the  correlation 

profiles of Mg1(cid:3)O6(cid:4)  and O1(cid:3)Mg6(cid:4) clusters calculated at MP2 level (using valence excitations 

only).  The  resulting  correlation  profiles bear again some resemblance with the experimental 

deviation, though we miss a large part of the correlation effects. Indeed, the limitation on the 

level  of  theory  involved  (MP2)  underestimates  the  number  of  electrons  at  high  values  of 

momenta.  Correlation  kinetic  energies  are  therefore  widely  underestimated:  we  found  0.48 

and  0.32  a.u.,  respectively  for  O1(cid:3)Mg6(cid:4)  and  Mg1(cid:3)O6(cid:4).  In  comparison,  the  correlation  energy 

for the embedded anion4 alone was estimated to -0.36 a.u. (which should roughly correspond 

to  an  increase  of  0.36  a.u.  of  the  kinetic  energy).  The  trend  of  both  correlation  profile  and 

experimental  deviation  evoke  this  time  the  correlation  profiles  of  free  2-  or  10-electron 

systems28.  Replacing  Harrison’s  O2-  basis-set  with  the  cc-pV6Z  one29  (troncated  after  p 

orbitals for feasibility) further led to a similar correlation profiles, though larger in magnitude 

at low momenta. Note that experimental core profiles of MgO have been subtracted following 

Issolah’s  procedure30.  Data  have  however  not  been  corrected  for  multiple  scattering,  which 

could  overestimate the experimental deviation amplitude (as suggested from experiments on 

LiH24).  

A previous analysis of MgO Compton profiles, based on a repeated cluster model, has 

shown  a  weak  electronic  coupling  between  ions31  together  with  a  relatively  high  Slater 

exponent for anionic valence orbitals (

). Such characteristics give the crystal the

.

aspect  of  an  assembly  of  well  closed-shell  systems,  which  is  consistent  with  the  correlation 

profiles we found. The fact that (cid:1)JCorr (q) > 0 at small values of q is usually associated to a 

radial correlation mechanism (in the case of free 2- and 10-electron systems), which slightly 

widens  electron  distributions.  Correlation  between  distant  ions  (Van  der  Waals effects)  also 

participates in the cohesion. They were estimated by Doll and co-workers4 to result in about 

40%  of  the  correlation  energy  participating  to  the  cohesion  of  the  crystal.  These  authors 

 

8

further estimated both contributions Mg-O and O-O as being about equal, which recommends 

including the second shell of neighbors for future estimations of correlated profiles.  

Despite  limitations  on  both  cluster  sizes  and  levels  of  theory,  correlation  profiles 

obtained confirm the observed experimental trends, that is, (cid:1)JCorr (0) < 0 for LiH and (cid:1)JCorr 

(0)  >  0  for  MgO.  Notice  that  (cid:1)JCorr  (q)  is  in  each  case  positive  at  high  momenta,  which  is 

consistent  with  the  Virial  theorem.  An  analysis  of  Mulliken  contributions  to  correlation 

profiles has further shown that correlation effects of larger magnitude are mainly associated to 

the anions. 

Taking advantage of the validity of the CPM in both R and P-space, we now analyze 

the influence of correlation on MgO structure factors. A comparison with experimental results 

requires taking into account thermal effects. To achieve this, the simplest method still relies 

on weighting each pseudo ion contribution fn by a Debye-Waller factor (Wn):

diffraction  experiment34  whereas  remaining  reflections  are  obtained  from  X-ray  diffraction35 

(the total number of reflections being 45). Given the small statistical errors (in all cases less

both  Mg13O14  and  O13Mg14  clusters  (afterwards  partitioned).  These  values  remain  within 

about  1%  after  correlation  corrections  and  are  further  in  very  close  agreement  with  those 

found in references 32 and 33. Results obtained for structure factors are shown on figure 9,

They are further compared to both experimental and DFT ones. The DFT results issued from 

an  original  method  developed  by  Cortona,  which  provides  optimal  physical  parameters  for 

ionic  compounds36.  The  quality  of 

the  fit

corrections are consistent and significant: the R9 factor ((cid:5) 103) changes from 8.91 (CPM/HF 

calculation) to 5.85 and 6.80 after correlation corrections issued from Mg1(cid:3)O6(cid:4) and O1(cid:3)Mg6(cid:4) 

calculations, respectively. These corrected values are closer to that calculated from Cortona’s 

results: 6.63. 

V. Conclusions and perspectives 

A cluster-based calculation, followed by an appropriate partition of the 1RDM, allows 

for  an  accurate  evaluation  of  1-electron  properties:  Compton  profiles,  structure  factors  and 

kinetic  energies.  The  local  character  of  pseudo  ion  contributions  simplifies  structure  factor 

refinements,  while  keeping  the  same  1RDMs  used  for  Compton  profile  calculations.  The 

CPM  was  tested  for  generic  materials  like  ionic  and  covalent  crystals  and  can  obviously  be 

applied  to  molecular  crystals  like  Ice  Ih,  for  which  it  seems  even  more  appropriate12.  Since 

periodicity of the system is not required, the CPM, together with usual embedding techniques, 

should help in understanding the role of disorder effects. However, the main difficulty when 

dealing with defects remains to define an appropriate partition of the 1RDM. 

Restriction  to  small  clusters  further  allows  for  a  fair  description  of  local  correlation 

effects on both Compton profiles (LiH and MgO) and structure factors (MgO). In each case, 

correlation effects are mainly associated to the anions. Subsequent correlation profiles show a 

qualitative  agreement  with the observed experimental trends, that is, (cid:1)JCorr (0) < 0  for LiH 

and  (cid:1)JCorr  (0)  >  0  for  MgO.  Such  features  might  invoke  different  correlation  mechanisms27.

Calculations  must  however  be  improved  in  order  to  achieve  better  comparisons  with 

experimental deviations, especially at high momenta. Local correlation effects on Si crystals 

are currently investigated.

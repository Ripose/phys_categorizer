Acoustical measurements, electron spin resonance, and Raman spectroscopy have been 
employed to probe sulfur over the temperature range 80° to 180° C, which includes the 
polymerization transition and the supercooled liquid state. Acoustical properties (sound 
velocity, absorption and impedance) have been studied with both longitudinal and 
transverse waves at frequencies between 500 kHz and 22 MHz. The results confirm that 
polymeric sulfur is a solution of long chain molecules in monomeric solvent, and that the 
polymerization transition is not a second order phase transition, as was proposed 
theoretically. Sulfur is a viscous liquid, but not viscoelastic, both below and above the 
polymerization transition temperature. It is shown that the classical Navier-Stokes theory 
is not applicable to the sound absorption in liquid sulfur in the highly viscous state.

INTRODUCTION 

Sulfur, one of the most interesting elements of the periodical table, exhibits a wide 

variety of allotropes of cyclic molecules (Sx, with x from 6 to 35) and the unusual phenomenon 

of equilibrium polymerization in the liquid state [1,2]. There is additional interest in 

understanding this transition because equilibrium polymerization also occurs in organic and 

biological systems [3]. Equilibrium polymerization can be viewed as a particular example of the 

general tendency in condensed matter for particles to cluster [4]. Sulfur is the simplest substance 

exhibiting this phenomenon, and therefore should be the most convenient to model. In addition, 

the polymerization transition in sulfur is an example of a liquid-liquid phase transition. Such 

transitions are currently of considerable interest [5].  

Polymerization in sulfur has been studied for many years (see Refs 1-3 and references 

therein), but a coherent picture of this phenomenon is still missing. Sulfur melts at about 120° C, 

forming a light-yellow low-viscosity liquid mostly consisting of 8-membered-ring molecules. In 

experimental papers the melting temperature of sulfur is nearly always accompanied by the word 

“about”. In our case the phrase “at about 120 °C” means that sulfur is definitely liquid at this 

temperature. However, sulfur can be melted at lower temperatures, but the process takes more 

 

 

1 

time. We melted pure sulfur (99.999%, Alfa Aesar Co.) at 105° C, keeping it at this temperature 

in a sealed quartz cell for three days. The long times required for complete melting are typical for 

polymers, as for example for selenium [6], and they suggest the presence of polymeric molecules 

below the melting temperature.  On the other hand, the observed interval for the melting 

temperature is consistent in part with results reported in Ref. 7, where it was ascribed to a 

difference in the melting temperature of different allotropes.  

Close to 159 °C properties of sulfur change dramatically. Shear viscosity η, as measured 

using the Poiseuille technique, increases by four orders of magnitude over a temperature interval 

25 C° [8]. More recent measurements performed with a sealed pyrex cell using a falling-ball 

technique indicate an even steeper change in η [9]. A specific feature resembling a λ-like 

singularity has been observed in temperature dependence of the heat capacity [10, 11]. Changes 

also occur in the temperature dependence of the density, ρ [12], and in the sound velocity, c [13, 

14]. The color of sulfur becomes darker, and the refractive index exhibits a minimum [15]. A 

minimum is also observed in the dielectric permittivity [16]. Electron spin resonance (ESR) 

spectra indicate a sharp increase of number of unpaired electrons. The ESR signal is interpreted 

as due to the appearance of linear polymers. An estimated degree of polymerization (average 

number of monomers in a polymeric chain) near the transition temperature Tp is on the order of 
106 [17]. Finally, molten sulfur quenched from temperatures below 159°C is easily soluble in 

carbon disulfide, whereas sulfur quenched from higher temperatures yields an insoluble fiber-

like residue, whose mass fraction Φ (also called extent of polymerization) grows with the 

quenching temperature and reaches saturation at about 300° C [2, 18]. The data for η, ESR 

spectra, and Φ suggest that liquid sulfur above 159°C is a solution of linear chain polymers in a 

monomeric solvent. 

On the other hand, measurements of the neutron diffraction spectra [19] did not reveal 

significant changes in structure of sulfur molecules. This allowed authors to suggest that the 

transition of sulfur to the high viscous state is not due to polymerization but due to percolation of 

different molecular units with similar local configuration, but different thermal stabilities. 

Measurements of Raman spectra [20] likewise did not indicate an anomaly at the transition 

temperature. These Raman data can be viewed as supporting the percolation hypothesis of the 

aforementioned work. On the other hand, the results of both Raman and neutron diffraction 

spectra are also consistent with the standard view that the S8 monomers convert to polymeric 

 

2 

chains at T ≥ Tp  and that the local structures of the polymers, such as bond lengths and bond 

angles, remain nearly the same as in the monomers [1]. In the most recent measurements of 

Raman spectra [21] a change in shape of a resonance peak was found, consistent with the 

polymerization hypothesis.  

The properties of sulfur near the polymerization transition are completely reversible as is 

the case for a continuous phase transition. Wheeler et al. [22], Cordery [23], and Anisimov et al. 

[24] treat the polymerization in sulfur as a second order phase transition in a weak external field, 

using a Heisenberg n-vector model in the limit n → 0, the Ising model (the n-vector model with 

n=1), and Landau theory supplemented with fluctuation theory, respectively. The order 

parameters in these models are proportional to Φ. It was shown [22], that an earlier theory by 

Tobolsky and Eiseberg [25], which successfully describes the temperature dependence of the 

degree and the extent of polymerization, can be considered a mean-field approximation for the 

second order phase transition. The second-order phase transition theories of the polymerization 

appear to be consistent with the experimental data on heat capacity.  Agreement with other 

properties, such as density, looks less convincing [3]. These properties, however, do not exclude 

a possibility that a modified version of the second-order phase transition model could be applied 

to the equilibrium polymerization. It is worth noting that the polymers are linear chains in the 

models of Wheeler et al. [22] and Anisimov et al. [24], whereas they are loops in the Cordery’s 

model [23].  

Using the second order phase transition theory Anisimov et al. calculated sound velocity 

c(T) for sulfur at the limit of zero frequency. A sharp minimum with a depth of about 10% from 

the value of c just below Tp has been predicted [24]. Taking into account that the minimum in c 

is a general feature of the second order phase transitions [26], one expects that accurate 

measurements of acoustical properties will provide the ultimate check of applicability of this 

approach to the phenomenon of equilibrium polymerization.  

Dudowicz, Freed and Douglas (DFD) proposed an alternative theory for the equilibrium 

polymerization [4], based on a mean-field Flory-Huggins-type incompressible lattice model. The 

lattice contains three kind molecular species: monomers, initiators, and chain polymers. This 

theory allows equilibrium properties, such as extent of polymerization and heat capacity, to be 

calculated; however compressibility and acoustical properties are out of scope of this model. The 

DFD theory agrees well with experimental data for α-methylsterene [3], which exhibits the 

 

3 

equilibrium polymerization upon cooling. According to the DFD theory the polymerization is not 

a thermodynamic phase transition, but can mimic one in the limit of zero concentration of the 

initiator. In particular, the heat capacity approaches the λ-like shape in this limit. The DFD-

model can be applicable to sulfur, for which the condition of the low initiator concentration is 

replaced by a condition of a small value of a constant of the initiator reaction (this constant for 
sulfur is on the order of 10-12 [25]). The principal feature distinguishing polymerization transition 

in the DFD-model from that in the second order phase transition models is that in the former 

dΦ/dT is a continuous function of T near Tp , whereas in the latter models Φ(Τ) is zero at T< Tp 

and has infinite slope at Tp.  

Recently we measured the velocity and absorption of sound in liquid and supercooled 

sulfur at temperatures up to 200 °C and at frequencies from 5 to 22 MHz [14]. We observed no 

dispersion, but we did observe a pronounced change in the slope of the temperature dependence 

of the sound velocity near the polymerization transition, instead of the minimum following from 

the second order phase transition model. Assuming that there is no dispersion down to zero 

frequency, the extent of polymerization Φ(T) was calculated. The results are consistent with data 

on the extent of polymerization as measured under static conditions [18]. Surprisingly, we 

observed no change in the absorption of sound.  

According to classical Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics [27], sound absorption α in liquids is 

described as 

α = [(4η/3 + ζ) + κ(Cv

-1 - Cp

-1)]ω2/2ρc3 , 

 

 

(1) 

where η and ζ are coefficients for the shear and bulk viscosities, respectively, κ is the coefficient 

of thermal conductivity, Cv and Cp are heat capacities, and ω = 2πf is the angular frequency. 

According to Eq. (1) the sound absorption near Tp should increase by four orders of magnitude as 

the shear viscosity does [8]. For a second-order phase transition an additional increase should be 

expected due to increase of ζ [28].  

Because we observed no such increase in absorption we tentatively proposed that the 

behavior might be associated with visoelasticity, which is typical for polymeric melts [29]. 

However, if this were the case, the visoelasticity could mask the minimum in c, and therefore the 

second order phase transition interpretation could be valid.  

The goals of this work are the following.  

 

4 

 

1. Resolving the paradox about inconsistency of sound absorption data [14] with the 

classical hydrodynamics formula (1). If the source of the discrepancy is visoelasticity, then our 

assumption about absence of sound dispersion down to zero frequency is incorrect and therefore 

the interpretation of polymerization in sulfur as a second order phase transition cannot be ruled 

out. And vice versa: if melted sulfur is not viscoelastic liquid, then the polymerization transition 

is not a second-order phase transition, and the search for a comprehensive model of the 

equilibrium polymerization phenomenon (perhaps on the basis of the DFD model) should be 

continued. For this purpose extended acoustical measurements reported below, have been 

performed. 

2. An additional check can be made on the basis of Raman spectrum measurements: if the 

polymerization transition were a second order phase transition, then the discontinuous change in 

dΦ/dT at Tp should lead to a change in the intensities of the peaks going through the transition. 

The Raman measurements reported below were designed to test this possibility.  

3. Finally, the ESR measurements have been performed to verify the type of the polymers 

in liquid sulfur: are they loop-like species, as proposed on bases of the data on neutron 

diffraction [19], or the polymers are the long liner chains. In addition we intended to check the 

presence of polymers in liquid sulfur in low-viscous state above and below the melting 

The next section briefly describes the experimental techniques. Results of the 

measurements are presented in Section 3. These results are discussed in Section 4.  Section 5 

temperature. 

contains a summary. 

2. EXPERIMENTAL 

Because the properties of sulfur are strongly affected by impurities and dissolved gases 

[1-3], careful precautions were taken to preserve the purity of the sulfur and to isolate it from air.  

We used sulfur of 99.9999% purity from Comica Ltd, Canada and of  99.999% purity from Alfa 

Aesar Co.  Sealed quartz and pyrex cells were employed for the Raman and ESR measurements, 

respectively.  These cells were filled with sulfur via sublimation under vacuum as described 

previously [14].  Sulfur that was carefully degassed and sealed in a quartz cell was used for the 

low-frequency sound velocity measurements. The sound absorption measurements utilized a cell 

made out of stainless steel, which was kept under vacuum. The measurements of sound 

 

5 

impedance were made with a quartz cell open to the air because of the need to access the end of 

the rod to remove a residual drop of sulfur.  The consistency of the data obtained in the different 

cells suggests that any effects of contamination are less than the experimental uncertainties. 

2.1. Electron spin resonance. 

 

ESR spectra of sulfur have been measured from room temperature to 200 °C using a 

Bruker Instruments ESR spectrometer operating at a microwave frequency of 9.5 GHz.  The 

spectra were taken with a modulation amplitude of 1 mT using standard first-harmonic detection 

techniques.  The sample was placed in a quartz, flow-through dewar and heated by passing hot 

nitrogen gas through the dewar.  The temperature was calibrated outside of the microwave cavity 

using a thermocouple in the sample tube.  The error in the temperature measurements was ± 1 K. 

2.2. Raman Spectroscopy.  

Raman spectra were obtained from solid sulfur at room temperature and from liquid 

sulfur at temperatures near the polymerization transition (from 150 to 170 °C).  The spectra were 

excited with the 488 nm and 514 nm lines of an argon ion laser, dispersed with a 0.75 m triple 

spectrometer, and detected with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera.  

The sample was held in an evacuated quartz ampoule in a heated copper block with a small 

opening for optical access.  The temperature was monitored with three standard copper-

constantan thermocouples, one at the level of the opening, one above and one below, to monitor 

the temperature over the entire sample volume.  The temperature of the sample was measured to 

within a tenth of a degree for each measurement.   

2.3. Acoustics.  

To check the possible dispersion, we extended the frequency range of the sound velocity 

measurements down to 500 kHz, which is a factor of ten lower than our previous measurements 

[14]. We also performed direct measurements of sound absorption by varying the length of the 

sample. A final check of the viscoelastic hypothesis was made by measuring sound impedance 

for both longitudinal and transverse sound waves. All the experiments were performed under 

steady state conditions using a pulsed phase-sensitive technique described elsewhere [30].

The theoretically predicted minimum in the sound velocity at the polymerization 

transition [24] is related to thermodynamic or “zero frequency” sound, which demands that the 

frequency be less than the lowest relaxation frequency of the system. The relaxation frequency fr 
can be estimated as  fr ≡ (τr )-1 ~ (η⋅β)−1, where β is compressibility of fluid [31]. For simple 

liquids fr is on the order of 10 to 100 GHz, and therefore sound velocity at frequencies in the 

MHz range is essentially the same as that for zero frequency. In polymeric systems the situation 

is different.  Configuration relaxation associated with collective displacements of big groups of 

atoms in macromolecules produces a distribution of relaxation times [32], the longest of which, 

τ*, can be in the range of microseconds to even milliseconds. If the time scale of the distortion is 

less than τ* the system possesses an effective Young’s modulus and behaves like an elastic solid; 

if the time scale of the distortion is greater than τ* the system responds to shear stress like a 

viscous liquid. This is the essence of the viscoelastic effect. 

2.3.1. Low frequency sound velocity. 

 

 

 

Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the 
quartz cell for measurements of 
sound velocity. 

The cell for the low frequency measurements is shown in Fig. 1. The cell was made out 

of quartz and has two parallel windows. To fulfill the plane-wave approximation, the diameter D 

was chosen 25 mm, which is for ten times greater than the sound wavelength λ. The sample 

length L, about 13 mm, was calibrated using water.

High purity sulfur powder was loaded in the cell, melted, and degassed under a vacuum 
of 10-6 mm Hg, after which the cell was sealed.  Experiments with sulfur in quartz cells require 

care because solid sulfur must be reheated very uniformly to avoid small temperature gradients 

that will crack the cell due to expansion on local melting. The cell was held in a glass oil bath as 

described in Ref. 14. The temperature of the sample was measured using three cooper/constantan 

thermocouples and controlled by an oil thermostat (6330, Hard Scientific, Inc) supplied with a 

home made pump. The temperature variation over the sample was less than 2 °C. High-

temperature ceramic piezoelectric transducers (Staveley Sensors Inc.) with a principal frequency 

of 500 kHz were attached to the windows via non-polymerized epoxy resin. The total fractional 

uncertainty of the sound velocity measurements was 0.2%. 

2.3.2. Sound absorption. 

Previous direct measurements of the sound absorption coefficient α in liquid sulfur [33] 

found a small increase in α near the polymerization transition. These measurements were 

performed at frequencies from 6 to 15 MHz using an open chrome-plated brass cell with a 

moving aluminum reflector. The authors noted instabilities in the reflected signal caused by 

forming and collapsing of gas bubbles in the liquid sulfur. In the present measurements this 
effect was excluded by keeping sample under vacuum (~ 10-4 mm Hg) in a hermetically sealed 

cell, shown schematically in Fig. 2.  The cell was inserted into a thick-walled copper block to 

produce a uniform temperature over the sample. The temperature was controlled with a Smart-3 

temperature controller, phase angle power controllers PC 120/240-PA (both of Temp, Inc), and 

three copper-constantan thermocouples.  For longitudinal sound measurements, single crystal 

lithium niobate transducers (12 mm diameter) with a principal frequency of 7 MHz were 

attached to the movable quartz rod and to the bottom of the cell as shown in Fig. 2.  The lower 

transducer served as the transmitter, and the upper one as the receiver.  The rod was displaced 

using a coaxial screw (not shown).  The maximum displacement of the rod was 25 mm.  This 

displacement was measured using a Cen-Tech. Co indicator with a precision of 0.002 mm.  The 

amplitude of the signal was measured on an oscilloscope screen with an uncertainty of about 5%.  

The total uncertainty for the sound absorption data was 10%. 

To decrease potential contamination of the sulfur by a reaction with stainless steel, we 

minimized the time of the measurements. Two runs were performed, each one with a new load of 

 

8 

sulfur. The first run took about 2 hours and the second run over more than 6 hours. The data 

were identical in both runs indicating that contamination, if any, does not affect the 

measurements within the error. After each run the cell was washed with carbon disulfide, and no 

traces of corrosion were noticed.

2.3.3. Sound impedance. 

 

If sulfur is viscoelastic it should support propagation of transverse sound waves [34]. We 

first attempted to perform direct measurements of the speed of transverse sound using a quartz 

cell as described in Ref. 14. The sample length was 0.8 mm. Quartz shear-mode transducers with 

a principal frequency of 5 MHz were attached to the buffer rods via hardened epoxy resin. 

Measurements were performed at 5, 15, and 25 MHz at temperatures up to 180 °C.  At all three 

frequencies the transmitted signal disappeared on melting and reappeared on solidification; no 

transmitted signal was observed either below or above the polymerization transition temperature.  

The absence of a transmitted signal may result either from the absence of the viscoelastic 

effect or from strong absorption of the shear waves in polymerized sulfur. To check these two 

 

9 

versions, we measured the acoustical impedance Z of the sample. In this experiment, an rf pulse 

of sound is sent down a quartz rod, and, the amplitude and the phase of the reflected (from the 

end of the rod) pulse are measured. The measurement is performed twice, once when the rod is 

in contact with the liquid and once when it is not. The ratio of the amplitudes of the reflected 

signals r and the phase shift between them θ  are associated with sound velocity c and sound 

absorption α as follows [35]:

3. RESULTS 

 

The ESR spectra are shown in Fig.3 for several temperatures.  The amplitude of 

the signal, and hence the number of chains, increases with temperature above 166 °C.  Below 

this temperature no spectrum was observed, indicating a spin density below the detection limit of 
the spectrometer, which is on the order of 1015 spins/cm3.

Superimposed Raman spectra at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4.  No dramatic 

change in spectral features was observed.  For an S8 molecule, the 475 cm-1 peak is the 
unresolved combination of the a1 and e1 Raman-active modes, while the 218 cm-1 peak is due to 

an a1 mode [21, 37].  Over the temperature range from 150 to 170 °C there is a monotonic 

decrease in the intensities of the peaks with increasing temperature.

Fig. 4.  Temperature dependence of Raman spectra from 150 to 170 °C.   
The inset shows the spectra near 475 cm-1 normalized to the same peak height.  
The relative increase of the low-frequency component in the inset is indicative of 
an increase in polymerization [21] as described in the text.  

 
In Figure 5, the intensity of the peak at 475 cm-1 is plotted as a function of temperature. 

The solid and open triangles indicate spectra taken while the sample was heating and cooling, 

respectively.  The intensity varies smoothly through the polymerization transition. This 

temperature dependence could, in principle, be due to changes in the Raman cross-section [38] 

with temperature, but most likely it is due to the temperature dependence of the optical 

 

11 

absorption coefficient [15].  At the energy of the exciting laser, the absorption coefficient 

increases with increasing temperature effectively decreasing the active volume of the sample.

Raman peak at 475 cm-1 near

Recently Kalampounias et al. [21] analyzed in detail the shape of the peak near 475 cm-1.  

Their analysis shows that the unresolved combination of Raman scattering is due to ring and 

chain components of the liquid, which may be fit to a sum of Lorentzian peaks to predict the 

extent of polymerization in the liquid.  A similar analysis of our data is shown as an inset in 
Figure 4.  The shoulder near 430 cm-1 is shown to increase relative to the overall peak intensity 

at temperatures above the polymerization transition indicating an increase of the polymers in 

agreement with Ref. 21. 

Results of measurements of the sound velocity at 500 kHz are shown in Fig.6 along with 

the data from previous measurements [14] (the new data are shown with larger symbols).  There 

is no dispersion in the sound velocity down to 500 kHz.  The time required to take each 

experimental point varied from 5 to 30 minutes.  In contrast to the kinetic effect that occurs at 

melting, no time dependence or hysteresis of the acoustical data were observed in liquid sulfur.  

Both the phase and the amplitude of the transmitted signal followed the temperature of the 

sample; as soon as the temperature was stabilized, the signal was stable as well.

To check for a dependence of the experimental data on the manufacturer of the sulfur, we 

repeated the experiment at 7 MHz with the cell described in Ref. 14 using sulfur received from 

S. C. Greer (99.9998% purity, Gallard-Schlesinger Chemical Corp.), which was identical to that 

used for density measurements [12]. The results, which are omitted from Fig. 6 for simplicity, 

were identical to those reported in Ref.14 and shown in Fig. 6.

Data for sound absorption at two representative temperatures are shown in Fig.7.  The 

absorption coefficient α in nepers per centimeter was calculated by fitting the data at each 

temperature to an exponential curve. Results of these fits at all temperatures are shown in Fig. 8.  

There is no specific feature in the sound absorption at the polymerization transition in agreement 

with previous measurements [14]. 

The data on sound velocity, and absorption still could be, in principle, consistent with the 

viscoelastic interpretation, if the relaxation frequency f* ≡ 1/τ∗ is below 100 kHz. 

For an ultimate check of the viscoelastic hypothesis, we performed measurements of the shear 

acoustical impedance.  

 

The apparatus was first tested with longitudinal sound. The amplitude ratio, r, and the 

phase shift θ  of the longitudinal acoustical impedance at 7 MHz are shown in Fig. 9. The data 

for r agree well with those calculated from precision density [12] and sound velocity [14] 

measurements. The measured phase shift θ  is essentially zero over the entire temperature range.  

Using only the shear viscosity term of  Eq. (1) and viscosity data [8] one can estimate θ  to be on 

of the order of 10-4 for low temperatures and close to π/2 above the polymerization transition.  

Clearly, this estimate disagrees with the experimental data for θ. However, the data are 

consistent with the sound absorption measurements of this work as well as with the data reported 

in Refs. 14 and 33.

to 180 °C yielded no change in either the amplitude (r = 1) or the phase (θ  = 0) of the reflected 

signal. The same result (r ≠ 1 for longitudinal waves, and r = 1 for transverse waves) occurs in 

water, which is definitely not viscoelastic.  

4. DISCUSSION 

The density of spins above the polymerization transition temperature, as estimated from 

the ESR, is shown in Fig.10.  Although the absolute densities are known only within about a 

factor of three, the relative densities shown in Fig. 10 are accurate within the errors shown.  The 

absolute densities are derived by comparison to a standard ESR sample.  Below 160 °C the 

density of unpaired spins is less than the detection limit of the spectrometer.

Fig. 9. Amplitude ratio r (triangles) and phase shift θ  (squares) measured with 

 
longitudinal waves at 7 MHz.  The solid line represents r calculated from Eq. (2) using precision 
data on density [12], sound velocity [14], and sound impedance of quartz [39].  The dashed line 
represents the phase shift calculated using Eq. (3) and the sound absorption data measured in this 
work.

The ESR signal comes from unpaired electrons that occur at the ends of the chain 

molecules [40].  Using the ESR data in combination with the data on the extent of 

polymerization Φ derived from the sound velocity data [14], the degree of polymerization D (the 

average number of monomers in a polymer or the average polymer length) was estimated as 

follows:   

D ~ ρ NavΦ /(n µ),  

 

 

 

 

 

(4) 

where Nav is Avogadro’s number, n is the number of spins per unit volume, and µ is the atomic 

mass.  Using the spin densities from Fig.10 and the extent of polymerization calculated from the 

sound velocity [14], the average chain length near the polymerization temperature is on the order 
of 105 monomers, which is consistent with the results of a more detailed ESR study [17].

The ESR measurements also allow us to estimate an upper limit for the possible number 

density of the chain molecules and their degree of polymerization. Assuming that n is of the 

order of the detection limit and Φ is of the order of the error in measurements of the extent of 

polymerization (≈ 1 %), one obtains that D at low temperatures might be as big as 105.  That is, 

the polymer length at low temperatures might be of the same order of magnitude as the length 

above the polymerization temperature. It is possible that existence of even small amount (≤ 1 %) 

of such macromolecules in solid sulfur might affect kinetics of melting.  

 

16 

The relative independence of the Raman spectra on temperature through the 

polymerization transition suggests that there is no visible difference in interatomic bonding 

between polymers and monomers that would affect the vibrational spectra. The smooth behavior 

of the Raman intensity is consistent with the DFD model.  

The null results from the measurements of transverse sound velocity and impedance, and 

the data on sound velocity at 500 kHz confirm that there is no dispersion down to zero 

frequency, and therefore acoustical properties measured in the MHz range can be treated as the 

data in the limit of zero frequency, as previously suggested [14]. This conclusion is consistent 

with Brillouin scattering spectra for liquid sulfur, where only the longitudinal mode peak was 

observed [41]. Contrarily, the Brillouin spectrum for viscoelastic liquid boron oxide (B2O3) 

exhibits well-defined peaks for both longitudinal and shear modes [42]. Thus we conclude that 

melted sulfur is not a viscoelastic liquid, and therefore the polymerization phenomenon is not the 

second order phase transition. This conclusion is consistent with predictions of the DFD-model 

[4]. Apart from that the data on Φ(T) [2, 3, 14, 18, 21] in the vicinity of the polymerization 

temperature Tp appear to be more consistent with the DFD-model, than with the second order 

phase transition models. 

In addition, the absorption of sound in polymeric sulfur is not proportional to the shear 

viscosity, as would be predicted from Eq. (1). One may speculate that, in a solution of 

monomers, initiators, and polymers, the low impedance of the monomeric component shunts the 

impedance of sound from the polymers. Therefore, the overall impedance of the system is 

determined by the component of lowest viscosity.  

CONCLUSIONS.  

The polymerization transition in liquid sulfur is a process of building long chain polymers 

from ring-like monomer units. The Raman spectra show that the interatomic bonding in sulfur 

remains essentially unchanged in both the monomeric and polymeric states.  Acoustical 

properties of sulfur measured in the MHz frequency range, represent these properties in the 

thermodynamic limit. Therefore, sound velocity data can be used to characterize the mass 

fraction of polymers above the polymerization transition, as was suggested in Ref. 14. The 

equilibrium polymerization in sulfur is not a second order thermodynamic phase transition but 

rather an equilibrium mixture of monomers and polymers, as described by the DFD-model [4].

Finally, the absence of anomaly in sound absorption near the polymerization transition testifies 

that eq. (1) is not applicable for the polymeric solution.

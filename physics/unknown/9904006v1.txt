Abstract

The  normal  mode  theory  of  the  transmission  lines  is  ap-
plied to the studies of the Four-Rod RFQ. This resonator con-
sists  of  four  quadrupole  electrodes  and  stems.  It  can  be
simulated  by  the  four-conductor  shielded  transmission  line,
which  is  loaded  by  sets  of  coaxial  transmission  lines
corresponding  to  the  support  stems.  The  ideal  case  of  the
indefinite  periodic  Four-Rod  RFQ  is  considered.  Formulas
for  resonance  frequency,  the  voltage  distribution  along  the
electrodes and the shunt impedance are obtained.

1.  INTRODUCTION

The  accelerating  structures  as  four-rod  RFQ  resonators
are widely used for linear accelerators [1-5]. These resonators
(fig.1 and  fig.2)  consist  of  four  quadrupole  electrodes  (rods)
1 and 2, which are located in the tank 3  and  connected  with
the tank by the stems 4.

4-rod RFQ are studied using the theory of propagating modes
(normal TEM modes).

2.  THE MODEL OF FOUR RODS RFQ RESONATORS
Assuming  only  TEM  waves  propagating  along  all  con-
ductors  of  four  rods  RFQ  resonator,  this  resonator  can  be
simulated  by  the  four-conductor  shielded  transmission  line
(4CSTL),  which  is  loaded  by  sets  of  coaxial  transmission
lines  (CTL's)  corresponding  to  the  stems.  The  equivalent
circuits  for  both  types  of  four  rods  RFQ  resonators  are
presented in fig.3 and fig.4.

Fig.3. Equivalent circuit of "In-line stem 4-rod RFQ".

Fig.4. Equivalent circuit of "Alternate stem 4-rod RFQ".

If we consider the 4CSTL as a main part of these circuits,
the difference between these two types of  RFQ  resonators  is
denoted  by  the  ways  of  connection  of  the  CTL's  to  the
4CSTL.

The  propagation  of  TEM  waves  is  described  by  the
system  of  the  well-known  telegraph  equations  [6-8]  for
voltage  and  current  on  the  conductors  of  the  N-conductor
transmission  line,  which  are  the  complex  functions  of  only
the  longitudinal  coordinate  z.  This  system  consists  of  2N
differential equations and can be written in the matrix form:

while the shields are numbered as the (N+1)th conductors.

In terms of the longitudinal connection points of the rods
with the tank wall on the neighboring electrodes, all of these
resonators can be grouped into two main types. The first type
can  be  named  as  "In-line  stem  4-rod RFQ"(fig.1).  It  is  the
way  of  connection  of  rods  with  the  tank,  where  the
connection points of all rods with the tank are located at the
same longitudinal position. The second type can be named as
"Alternate stem 4-rod RFQ". It is another way of connection
of  rods  with  the  tank,  where  each  set  of  opposing  rods  is
connected to the tank at the middle of the successive supports
of the other set of rods(fig.2).

In this paper, an equivalent circuit modeling of the  4-rod
RFQ resonators is proposed. This approach can be considered
as  the  extension  of  studies  of  4-rod  RFQ  [2-5],  which
generally  uses  the  conventional  transmission  line  theory
based  on  the  concepts  of  distributed  parameters  and  using  a
circuit-analysis approach. Here, operating resonator modes in

3.  NORMAL MODES FOR THE 4CSTL

the  superposition  of 

these  normal  modes 

In  a  transmission  line  with  N  conductors  there  are  N
normal TEM modes of propagation and any field is expressed
by 
[7,8].
Mathematically the problem of a definition of normal modes
is  one  of  calculation  of  a  so-called  modal  matrix  (cid:2) M (cid:2) [7,8],
which  allows  conversion  of  the  square  matrices  (cid:2)
and  
(cid:2) L (cid:2)   of  the  initial  system  (1)  into  the  diagonal  form.  It
was  found  that  the  transformation  to  the  normal  modes  can
be expressed by:

and 4th modes corresponds to figures a), b), c) and d),
respectively.

As  can  be  seen,  the  mode  fields  have  clear  physical
meaning.  The  first  mode  can  be  named  as  the  coaxial,
because it corresponds to the usual CTL with  split  four-wire
central conductor. The second mode is a quadrupole one. The
third and fourth modes are two dipole modes. The directions
of 
their  fields  are  perpendicular  between  each  other.
Obviously, only the second mode has suitable field for RFQ,
that is,  the  other  modes  can  be  considered  as  parasitic  ones.
The  coaxial  mode  does  not  penetrate  the  accelerating
channel, while the dipole modes can distort the stable particle

2192

motion. Therefore, it is necessary to derive the conditions to
suppress  the  dipole  mode  components  in  the  operating
resonator mode.

voltage  and  current  on  the  4CSTL  conductors,  this  means

necessary  conditions  for  equivalent  circuit  parameters  of
stems can be obtained. According to the equivalent circuits in
fig.3 and fig.4, stems are simulated by CTL's, therefore these
necessary  conditions  can  be  formulated  for  electrical
parameters of CTL's. They are expressed as the demands that
the  input  impedance  of  CTL's  connecting  to  opposing
conductors  of  the  4CSTL  should  be  the  same.  Figure  6
illustrates  some  configurations  of  stems  for  "Alternate  stem
4-rod  RFQ"  and  their  equivalent  circuits  at  assumption  that
stems are simulated by CTL's shorted at the end.  The  CTL's
have the length l0, wave impedance Z0 and input impedance
Zin=iX0,  where  X0=Z0tg(kl0).  The  cases  a),  b)  and  c)  of  the
stems in fig.6 have the same equivalent stems impedance for
opposing  rods  and  hence,  the  necessary  conditions  are
satisfied.  In  cases  d)  and  e),  these  impedance  are  not  equal
due  to  some  additional  reactance  CA  and  LA,  and  the  field
will have dipole components. The proposed model allows the
evaluation  of  the  dipole  fields  with  real  stem  configurations
for studies of dipole component effects on beam dynamics.

5.  RF CHARACTERISTICS OF 4-ROD RFQ'S

RF characteristics of the two types of resonators (fig.1,2)
were  studied  by  equivalent  circuits  in  fig.3  and  fig.4.  The
calculations were carried out for two different configurations
of stems, which have different values of X0. The first one  is
shown  in  fig.6-a)  (at  r=Re=R0)  and  the  second  one  in  fig.6-
c).

In  the  equivalent  circuit  of  "In-line  stem  4-rod  RFQ"
(fig.3), only quadrupole TEM mode component  exists  in  the
the
4CSTL  at  the  operating  resonator  mode.  But 
equivalent circuit of "Alternate stem 4-rod RFQ" (fig.4), two
TEM mode components (coaxial and quadrupole) exist in the
4CSTL  at  operating  resonator  mode.  The  following  two
equations  are  the    resonance    conditions    for    the  first    and
second types of 4-rod RFQ, respectively:

The  voltage  flatness  d   is  defined  as  a  maximum  value  of

The  efficiency  of  RFQ  structures  is  described  by  the  specific
shunt-impedance,  r [1], defined  by  r =Ûv
2/(2P/l),  where  P  is  the
power loss, which is calculated from the distribution of the surface
current  density  jS  on  the  cavity  surface.  For  our  model,  the
longitudinal  distribution  of  jS  is  defined  by  the  solutions  of  the
telegraph  equations  (1)  and  the  transverse  distribution  of  jS  is
obtained  from  the  solution  of  the  corresponding  electrostatic
problems  for  normal  TEM  modes  (fig.5).  Thus,  this  model  takes
into consideration the non-uniformity of current distribution on the
conductors  of  the  4CSTL  determined  by  so-called  the  proximity
effect  due  to  close  spacing  of  the  conductors  [9].  The  total  power
loss P is the sum of the loss P1 on the 4CSTL  and  the  loss  P2  on
CTL's. For the 1st type of resonator these values are:

6.  CONCLUSION
The  presented  equivalent  circuit  modeling  allows 
the
calculation of the RF characteristics of 4-Rod RFQ resonators for a
wide range of geometrical parameters. It demonstrates the existence
of  an  essential  difference  between  "In-line  stem  4-rod RFQ"  and
"Alternate  stem  4-rod  RFQ".  From  graphs  it  is  seen  that  the  first
type  of  4-rod  RFQ  has  a  better  RF  characteristics  than  the  second
one  for  large  values  of  R/l
  it  has  a
unsatisfactory voltage flatness. That is, there is some value of R/l
,
at lower side of which the second type of resonator is preferable to
the first one. Practically this means that if a tank diameter is fixed,
the  "Alternate  stem  4-rod  RFQ"  should  be  applied  for  lower
frequencies  and  "In-line  stem  4-rod RFQ"  should  be  applied  for
higher frequencies. The present approach is useful at an initial stage
in designing of the 4-rod RFQ resonators.

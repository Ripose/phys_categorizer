Abstract 

Traditionally  devoted  to  electron  density  profile  measurement  we 
show  that  fast  frequency  sweeping  reflectometry  technique  can  bring 
valuable and innovative measurements onto plasma turbulence. While fast 
frequency sweeping technique  is traditionally devoted to electron density 
radial profile measurements we show in this paper how we can handle the 
fluctuations  of  the  reflected  signal  to  recover  plasma  density  fluctuation 
measurements  with  a  high  spatial  and  temporal  resolution.  Large  size 
turbulence  related  to  magneto-hydrodynamic  (MHD)  activity  and  the 
associated  magnetic  islands  can  be  detected.  The  radial  profile  of  the 
micro-turbulence,  which  is  responsible  for  plasma  anomalous  transport 
processes,  is  experimentally  determined  through  the  fluctuation  of  the 
reflected phase signal. 

 
 
 
 
I. Introduction 
 

Plasma turbulence is among the most important issues, which have to be addressed to 
appreciate  the  plasma  equilibrium  questions  of  magnetic  fusion  experiments.  Problems  of 
plasma  discharge  sustainment  [1]  can  be  destabilized  by  MHD  activity,  which  can  drive 
damaging  fast  electron  towards  the  inner  wall  and/or  conduct  major  plasma  disruption.  For 
example, plasma confinement regimes with full wave current drive experiment, specially used 
to  achieve  long  duration  plasma  discharges,  are  particularly  exposed  to  MHD  stability 
problems.  Moreover,  anomalous  radial  transport  is  enhanced  by  instabilities  and  the  major 
mechanisms and/or the dominant driving forces for these turbulent processes are never clearly 
identified.  Due  to  such  theoretical  difficulties  there  are  issues  in  which  experiments  could 
help to clarify these studies so that innovative and comprehensible diagnostic  measurements 
are required. Reflectometry is a diagnostic permitting detailed research on this particular topic 
and benefits on a well-established technique.  
 
 
II. Fast frequency sweeping reflectometry  
 

Tore  Supra  is  equipped  with  fast  frequency  sweeping  (20  m s)  X-mode  heterodyne 
reflectometers  [2]  dedicated  to  electron  density  profile  measurements  and  covering  the 
frequency  range  from  50  to 110  GHz. These  reflectometers  provide  electron  density  profile 
measurements routinely and automatically on a shot to shot basis. Fast and repetitive sweeps 
(with  5  m s  dead time  between  sweeps),  named  burst  mode technique,  provide  an  equivalent

sampling  of  40  kHz  at  a  given  probing  frequency  and  allow  fast  plasma  events  to  be 
measured. The  heterodyne and  sine/cosine detection allows separate  measurements of phase 
and  amplitude  of  the  reflected  signal  with  a  S/N  sensitivity  of  about  40  dB.  Reflectometry 
relies on the fact that, as an electromagnetic wave propagates through the plasma, its phase is 
shifted due to the departure of the local refractive index from the vacuum value. At a certain 
critical density corresponding to the cut-off layer, this refractive index goes to zero and then 
the probing wave is reflected. For the reflectometers of TORE SUPRA, the wavenumber (k) 
of the probing waves are ranging  from k0 (10 to 23 cm-1)  into the vacuum to zero when the 
cut-off  layer  is reached. In addition to the reflection at the cut-off, backscattering due to the 
density fluctuations and ranging up to 2k0 (according to the Bragg’s law) occurs all along the 
propagation path (figure 1).

Figure  1  :  Schematic  of  the  propagation  wave  through  plasma.  As  the  wave 
propagates  towards  the  cut-off  layer  the  refractive  index  (N)  goes  to  zero. 
During its propagation the wave experience Bragg scattering processes at high k 
values,  while  close  to  the  cut-off  the  propagation  is  mainly  affected  by  local 
density gradients and low k turbulence. 

These  fluctuations  bring  phase  and  amplitude  fluctuations  onto  the  recorded  signal.

Despite  the  continuous  variation  of  the  probing  wavenumber  value  we  will  classify  these 
fluctuations into two categories, large size (low k) and small size (high k) turbulence, which 
will be described in the following sections. 
 
 
III. MHD 
 

On  tokamaks  particles  follow  a  helical  path  as  they  go  round  the  torus.  This  helical 
path  is  determined  by  the  safety  factor  q(r)  that  is  the  ratio  between  the  toroidal  and  the 
poloidal rotations round the torus. q(r)  is  itself  strongly related to the plasma current profile 

 (BF and I being respectively the toroidal field and current). MHD equilibrium of

tokamak  configuration  exhibits  singular  magnetic  surfaces  when  the  safety  factor  profile 
reaches rational  values.  At these positions,  magnetic  field  line reconnections give rise to the 
formation  of  magnetic  islands.  High  spatial  and  temporal  resolution  of  fast  sweep 
reflectometry makes possible to investigate the MHD activity, to localise the islands and their 
dynamics  up  to  20  kHz  [3].  Furthermore,  an  analysis  of  the  amplitude  variations  of  the 
reflected  signal  points  out  precious  indications  on  their  poloidal  shape.  There  is  a  special 
interest  in  identifying  modes  with  low  values  of  the  integers  m  and  n  in  order to  constraint 
equilibrium code during calculations of the plasma current profile. 
 

Experimental  observation  and  radial  localisation  of  magnetic  islands  is  performed 
through  the  detection  of  the  major  group  delay  jumps.  Figure  3a  and  3b  illustrates  the q 
profile evolution recorded by the reflectometry during a plasma current ramp-up experiment. 
Localised  perturbations  are  radially  detected  and  agree  with  the  q=2/1  and  q=1/1  rational 
surfaces calculated by the equilibrium code. However, at t = 9s, the q=2/1 surface is no longer 
visible and it points out the limit of this method since magnetic islands have to be present into 
the plasma discharge to be recorded.

IV. Micro-turbulence 
 

Subtraction  of  the  recorded  phase  of  each  frequency  sweep  from  the  average  phase 
over  several  sweeps  (typically  a  few  hundreds)  provides  the  reflected  signal  phase 
fluctuations (Figure 4a). The radial dependence of the phase fluctuations is determined from 
the reconstructed density profiles. A Fourier analysis of this radial dependence provides then 
the wavenumber spectrum of the phase fluctuations (Figure 4b).

Unfortunately,  in  X-mode,  there  is  no  explicit  analytical  relationship  between  the 
phase  fluctuations  as  for  O-mode  propagation  [4]  and  the  electron  density  fluctuations. 
Consequently,  numerical  1D  full  wave  calculations  are  requested  to  provide  the  normalised 
transfer function. The inputs of the code are the experimental density profiles, the calculated

independent  modes  with  given  radial  (with  constant  amplitude  for  the  normalisation)  and  k 
spectrum distribution (wide enough to cover twice the wavenumber probing wave range). 
 

Moreover,  when  performing  radial  sliding  Fourier  transform  (Figure  5a)  we  can  get 
some  radial  dependence  of  the  phase  fluctuations  as  long  as  we  consider  the  spectrum 
between  a  restricted  wavenumber  domain  (typically  between  3  to  10  cm-1).  As  a  matter  of 
fact,  Bragg  back  scattering  occurs  all  along  the  propagating  plasma  region  of  the  probing 
wave,  but  one  can  get  reasonable  spatial  resolution  (D R  ~  3  to  5  cm  depending  on  local 
gradients) for such fluctuating wavenumber range. Thus, the density fluctuations (Figure 5b) 
are  determined  by  performing  the  power  spectral  density  (PSD)  of  the  phase  fluctuation 
spectrum corrected by the transfer function F(k) determined with the full wave code.

V. Summary 
 

Fast frequency sweeping reflectometry has been routinely running to perform density 
profile  measurements  onto tokamak  devices  for  many  years  now.  Due  to the  high  technical 
performances  of  Tore  Supra  set-up,  accurate  determination  of  the  reflected  phase  signal  is 
achieved  with  a  high  radial  resolution.  MHD  activity  can  be  clearly  observed  as  long  as 
magnetic  islands  are  present  into  the  plasma.  This  situation  gives  relevant  experimental 
information  to  constrain  the  plasma  current  profile  calculated  from  equilibrium  codes. Last 
but not least, the radial profile of the density fluctuations has been determined. This new and 
very  promising  result  need  further  experiment  in  order to  bring  additional  information  onto 
the energy confinement issues required to burning plasma experiment.

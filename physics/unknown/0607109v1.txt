Theory of aces: high score by skill or luck?

We studied the distribution of WWI fighter pilots by the number of victories they were credited with 
along  with  casualty  reports.    Using  the  maximum  entropy  method  we  obtained  the  underlying 
distribution of pilots by their skill. We find that the variance of this skill distribution is not very large, 
and  that  the  top  aces  achieved  their  victory  scores  mostly  by  luck.  For  example,  the  ace  of  aces, 
Manfred von Richthofen, most likely had a skill in the top 29% of the active WWI German fighter 
pilots, and was no more special than that. When combined with our recent study [9], showing that 
fame grows exponentially with victory scores, these results (derived from real data) show that both 
outstanding achievement records and resulting fame are mostly due to chance.  
 
During the “Manhattan project” (the making of nuclear bomb), physicist Enrico Fermi asked General 
Leslie Groves, the head of the project, what is the definition of a “great” general [1]. Groves replied 
that any  general who had won five battles in a row might safely be  called great. Fermi then asked 
how many generals are great. Groves said about three out of every hundred. Fermi conjectured that if 
the chance of winning one battle is 1/2 then the chance of winning five battles in a row is
.  
321
“So you are right, General, about three out of every hundred. Mathematical probability, not genius.” 
 
Similarly, to a great general, an ace is a fighter pilot who achieved five or more victories. Can the 
latter   be explained by simple probability, like the former? At first glance this does not appear to be 
so, as some aces scored way too many   victories. For example, the probability to achieve by pure 
chance Manfred von Richthofen’s 80 victories is 
. One is tempted to conclude that high-
21
scoring aces had outstanding skills. 
 
A  more  careful  analysis  proves  this  conclusion  wrong.  During  WWI  British  Empire  Air  Forces 
credited  their  pilots  for  moral  victories  (Ref.  [2],  p.6).  It  is  not  that  unlikely  to  achieve  five  moral 
victories if you can have five moral defeats in between. In addition British Air Force fully credited 
their  pilots  for  shared  victories  (Ref.  [2],  p.8).      That  is  if  e.g.  three  British  airplanes  shot  one 
German airplane – all three were credited with a victory. The French did not count moral victories, 
but  allowed  for  shared  ones  (Ref.  [3],  p.6).  The  Americans  were  either  under  French  or  British 
command  and  had  the  corresponding  rules  applied  to  them.  In  contrast,  the  Germans  had  ideal 
scoring system (Ref. [4], p.6-7). They did not count moral victories. The opponent aircraft had to be 
either  destroyed  or  forced  to  lend  on  German  territory  and  its  crew  taken  prisoners.  They  did  not 
allow shared victories as well1. This was in theory. In practice, however, military historians   “have 
found a number of ‘victories’ where, say, three Allied aircraft have been claimed and credited when

1 This brought another problem.  It happened that there were two or more  claims for one destroyed 
opponent aircraft. Military historians had found that “In some of these cases rank or being a higher 
scoring ace helped win the decision over a more lowly pilot” (Ref. [4], p.7).  Several such cases are 
documented  in  Ref.  [5]:    Vizefeldwebel  (Sergeant-Major)  Boldt  claimed  a  victory,  but  it  was  also 
claimed by and awarded to Ltn von Schönebeck (Ref. [5], p.108);  Vizefeldwebel (Sergeant-Major) 
Hegeler  claimed  a  victory,  but  it  was  also  claimed  by  and  awarded  to  Ltn  d  R  Müller  (Ref.  [5], 
p.157).  This phenomenon, if widespread, can alone generate aces through the cumulative advantage 
mechanism. However, we   have no evidence that this practice was widespread, and will ignore its 
effect in this paper. 

there  is  absolutely  no  doubt  that  only  one  or  two  of  those  Allied  planes  were  lost”  (Ref.  [4],  p.7). 
This means that in reality some moral or shared victories were counted by the Germans. 
 
Ref. [5] contains the list of all German WWI fighter pilots, with all of their victories and casualties.  
The total number of credited victories is 67452. The number of casualties, however, is a lot smaller3.  
They  amount  to  630  KIA  (killed  in  action),  52  WIA/DOW  (wounded  in  action  and  later  died  of 
wounds),  137  POW  (prisoner  of  war),  and  431  WIA  (wounded  in  action  and  survived).  One  can 
safely count KIA, WIA/DOW, and POW as defeats. These add up to 819. This is by a factor of 8.2 
less than the number of credited victories. It is not clear what fraction of WIA one can add to defeats, 
as  many  wounds  were  not  severe,  and  the  pilots  could  soon  resume  flying  combat  missions. 
However, even if we count all of the WIA as defeats we get 1,250 defeats, which is still by a factor 
of 5.4 less than the number of credited victories. 
 
We  don’t  know  for  sure  why  the  number  of  victories  exceeds  the  number  of  casualties  by  such  a 
large factor, but can suggest several possible reasons: 
 

•  Moral and shared victories. 
•  Aces flew fighter-planes, while their opponents often were less well armed aircraft.  
•  German Air Force fought mostly defensive war behind their front lines [4].   So, if a German 
aircraft was shot down, it could land on their territory. In contrast, when Allied aircraft was 
shot down, it had to land on the enemy territory and its pilot was taken  prisoner.  

•  The Germans were better.   
 

2.91

Fortunately,  we  don’t  need  to  know  the  exact  reason  to  compare  German  fighter  pilots  between 
themselves. Let us, given the ratio of the number of defeats to the number of victories, compute the 
probability to get Richthofen’s score.  Assuming that the ratio of the probability of credited victory 
to  the  probability  of  defeat  is  8.2,  the  probability  of  defeat  in  each  decisive  engagement 
is
. The probability

is
. Richthofen’s score is thus within the reach of chance. We can also compute

The probability to win n fights and lose the next is:

Figure 1 shows the result of Eq.(1) (with 
) compared to the actual distribution of the victory 
scores.  While  the  agreement  is  not  perfect,  it  is  clear  that  chance  can  account  for  most  of  the 
variance in the numbers of victories. 
  
Apart from not leading to a quantitative agreement with the data, the above simple analysis assumes 
that fighter pilots always fight until they get killed.  In reality many of them did not even look for a 
fight. There were 820 German fighter-pilots who did not score a single victory and also were never

2 This number is the sum of 5050 victories credited to aces and 1695 victories credited to non-ace 
pilots.  The  first  number  is  accurate,  as  aces  victory  scores  are  available  in  electronic  format  (for 
example on this website: http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/).  The second number is a result of the 
hand-count using the listing in Ref. [5], so some error was most likely introduced.   
3 The casualties, which are listed on pp 345-357 of Ref. [5], were manually counted.  

wounded or shot down.  Also   many pilots with just few victories survived the war. In many of such 
cases they joined the Air Force shortly before the end of the war.

A better way to address the problem is to study the probability of defeat as a function of the number 
of  previous  victories.  Table  1  shows  the  statistics  of  casualties  (KIA  +  WIA/DOW  +POW)  as  a 
function  of  the  number  of  previous  victories.  For  example,  397  pilots  were  defeated  before  they 
achieved  a single victory. At the same time 1321 pilots achieved one or more victory. This makes

Figure 2. The actual defeat rate as a function of fight number, determined using the data of Table 1, 
is  shown  by  rhombs.  The  line  represents  the  same  rate,  theoretically  computed  assuming  that  the 
distribution of the rate of defeat in the pool of pilots given in Fig. 3. 

 
The  rate  of  defeat  computed  this  way  using  the  data  of  Table  1  is  shown  in  Fig.2.  The  rate  drops 
strongly for the first few fights, but appears not to change after about ten fights. The reduction in rate 
of defeat can be explained assuming that pilots have different inherent rate of defeat4, which depends 
on  their  skill.  The  unskilled  ones  get  killed  more  often,  and  as  we  progress  to  higher  number  of 
 then  the 
fights  the  average  skill  increases.  If  the  distribution  of  the  intrinsic  defeat  rates  is

4 Variance  in  intrinsic  skill  is  one  possible  explanation  of  the  decrease  of  the  defeat  rate  with  the 
increase  of  the  fight  number.  Another  explanation  is  that  the  pilots  are  simply  getting  more 
experienced.  In  reality  both  factors  play  role  and  their  relative  contributions  are  impossible  to 
determine.

Obviously, nr  , given by Eq.(3), monotonically decreases with n. When the minimum defeat rate in 
 is  greater  than  zero,  nr  approaches  this  rate  at  some  value  of  n  and  then 
the  distribution 
decreases no further. Fig. 2 suggests that this minimum defeat rate is around 3%. 
 
One  can  use  Eq.(3)  to  compute  the  defeat  rates  for  trial  distributions, 
distribution which fits the data of Fig. 2 best. However, a better way to find

The inference for five representative pilots, computed using Eqs. (2) and (6) is given in Fig. 4.   In 
particular, Manfred von Richthofen most likely had the intrinsic defeat rate of 2.5%.  According to 
the distribution of intrinsic defeat rates shown in Fig. 3 about 29% of pilots have the defeat rate of 
2.5% or lower. This means that MvR is most likely merely in top 29% according to his skill.  

                                                 
5 Note that the knowledge of the distribution of defeat rate allowed us to estimate the defeat rate of 
the undefeated pilots. Similar approach was previously used to estimate the true dropped calls rates 
when no dropped calls happened during the test [8].

In our previous paper on the theory of aces [9] we found a strong correlation between the logarithm 
of  fame  (measured  in  numbers  of  Google  hits)  and  the  achievement  (number  of  victories), 
suggesting  that  fame  grows  exponentially  with  achievement.  In  other  words  fame  gives  increasing 
return on achievement, but still is determined by this achievement. This would be OK if achievement 
was  proportional  to  skill.  However,  now  we  have  shown  that  the  difference  in  the  number  of 
victories is mostly due to chance. This means that the fame in the end is due to chance. There were a 
couple  of  papers  ([10],  [11])  which  speculated,  using  arguments  akin  to  the  one  by  Fermi  in  the 
beginning of the article, that people can be perceived as having extraordinary ability when in reality 
they are simply lucky. However, this paper is the first one which argues it using real data.

The probability also is discretized in 1000 units of 0.001. These 1000 units of probability are initially 
distributed at random over the 100 defeat rates. Then we use the following maximization algorithm.

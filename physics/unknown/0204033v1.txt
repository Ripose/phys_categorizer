1. Introduction.

The triode was invented by Lee de Forest in 1907, and soon afterwards the first amplifiers were
built.  By  1921  the  "thermionic  tube"  amplifiers  were  so  developed  that  C.  A.  Hartmann  [1]
made  the  first  courageous  experiment  to  verify  Schottky's  formula  for  the  shot  noise  spectral
density  [2].  Hartmann's  attempt  failed,  and  it  was  finally  J.  B.  Johnson  who  successfully
measured  the  predicted  white  noise  spectrum  [3].  However  Johnson  also  measured  an
unexpected  "flicker  noise"  at  low  frequency:  his  results  are  shown  in  figure  1,  and  shortly
thereafter W. Schottky tried to provide a theoretical explanation [4].

Figure 1: the spectral density observed by J. B. Johnson, as shown in his original paper [3]. The
vertical scale represents the observed noise power density divided by the theoretical shot noise
power density; the horizontal scale is the frequency in Hz.

Schottky's explanation was based on the physics of electron transport inside the vacuum tube,
but in the years that followed Johnson's discovery of flicker noise it was found that this strange
noise appeared again and again in many different electrical devices.
The  observed  spectral  density  of  flicker  noise  is  actually  quite  variable:  it  behaves  like  1/f ,

  is  in  the  range  0.5  ÷  1.5,  and  usually  this  behavior  extends  over  several  frequency

where 
decades.
The appearance of power laws in the theory of critical phenomena and above all the work of B.
Mandelbrot on fractals in the 1970's [5], seemed to indicate that something deeper was hidden
in those ubiquitous spectra. Power laws and 1/f spectra were found most unexpectedly in many
different phenomena, and figure 2 shows two such spectra reproduced in a famous review paper
by W. H. Press [6].

The work of Clarke and Voss on 1/f noise in resistors also spawned an interesting aside, a study
of 1/f noise in music, which become widely known thanks to an excellent popularization made
by  M.  Gardner  in  his Scientific  American  column  [9].  Clarke  and  Voss  found  that  both  voice
and music broadcasts have 1/f spectra (see figure 3) [10], and they even devised an algorithm to
compose "fractal" music [11].

(from ref. [10]).

By then many physicists were convinced that there had to be a deep reason for the ubiquity of
this  kind  of  power-law  noises,  that  there  had  to  be  something  akin  to  the  universality  of
exponents in critical phenomena, and therefore many people set out to find an all-encompassing
explanation.

2. 1/f  noise from the superposition of relaxation processes

An early and simple explanation of the appearance of 1/f  noise in vacuum tubes was implicit in
some  comments  of  Johnson  [3],  and  was  stated  mathematically  by  Schottky  [4]:  there  is  a
contribution to the vacuum tube current from cathode surface trapping sites, which release the
electrons  according  to  a  simple  exponential  relaxation  law  N(t) = N0e
t   for  t ‡ 0   and
N(t) =0  for  t < 0. The Fourier transform of a single exponential relaxation process is

F(

) =

- i

N(t)e

tdt

= N0

- ( + i

= N0

therefore for a train of such pulses  N(t,tk ) = N0e
we find

( t - t k )  for  t ‡

t k  and  N(t,tk ) =0  for  t < t k,

F(

where  n  is  the  average  pulse  rate  and  the  triangle  brackets  denote  an  ensemble  average.  This
spectrum is nearly flat near the origin, and after a transition region it becomes proportional to
2 at high frequency. This was sufficient for Schottky, who had found such a dependence in
1/
Johnson's  data,  but  later  it  became  clear  that  a  single  relaxation  process  was  not  enough,  and
that there had to be a superposition of such processes, with a distribution of relaxation rates 

[12].  If  the  relaxation  rate  is  uniformly  distributed  between  two  values 
amplitude of each pulse remains constant, we find the spectrum

How stable is this result? Is it still possible to obtain similar spectra changing the assumptions to
fit reasonable physical needs?
These  questions  can  at  least  partly  be  answered  with  a  direct  numerical  simulation:  figure  6
shows the result for a uniform random distribution of the relaxation rates, and it is clear that the

final distribution is insensitive to small deviations from a perfectly uniform distribution of the
relaxation rates.

3. Infinitely large fluctuations?

From  the  previous  discussion  one  may  argue  that  it  is  important  to  find  experimentally  the
actual limiting values   1 and  2, in order to characterize the noise process. Unfortunately this is
seldom possible, and in most cases it seems that the 1/f behavior continues as far as one can see:
consider for instance the beautiful data of Pellegrini, Saletti, Terreni and Prudenziati[15] shown
in figure 7, the 1/f behavior extends over more than 6 frequency decades and there seems to be
still no noise power flattening at low frequency.

perfect 1/f noise, the behavior extends over more than 6 frequency decades and there seems to
be no noise power flattening at low frequency.

Caloyannides did a very long data-taking run using operational amplifiers as noise sources and
extended his measurements down to 10-6.3 Hz: he observed a 1/f1.23 spectrum with no flattening
at low frequency (see figure 8) [16].

Figure  8:  Caloyannides  [16]  took  data  for  three  months  on  an  array  of  operational  amplifiers,
and measured a 1/f1.23 spectrum down to 10-6.3 Hz.

What  if  this  behavior  were  real,  and  it  continued  indeed  down  to  zero  frequency?  Then  we
would hit disaster, because the integrated fluctuation would be

and this expression always diverges, either at the low-frequency limit (for  >1) or at the high-

frequency  limit  (for  <1)  or  both  (for  =1),  so  that  low  frequency  fluctuations  are  arbitrarily
large. Press commented jokingly on this divergence in the spectrum of the Bermuda sea level
fluctuations  (figure  2b)  remarking  that  "If  you  postpone  your  Bermuda  vacation  for  too  long,
the island may be underwater!" [6].
But is this divergence real? Flinn [17] produced a simple argument that shows that we should
not worry about it even if it were there. Indeed for a true 1/f spectrum we know that

between these two extremes, so that the highest possible total fluctuation can be only 38 times

about the mathematical divergences.

4. Noise in diffusion processes

Most  of  the  early  noise  studies  were  carried  out  on  resistors,  operational  amplifiers  or  other
electronic equipment and systems. A special emphasis was placed on resistors, and thus it was
quite natural to identify simple random processes like the simple random walk and more general
diffusion processes as possible origins of 1/f noise.
Let us start with the simple stochastic differential equation for the Wiener process

dx
dt

= n(t)

that  describes  Brownian  motion  in  one  space  dimension,  where  x(t)  is  the  position  of  the
Brownian particle, and n(t) is a Gaussian white noise process with standard deviation 
, so that
n(t)n(t + ) = 2 ( ) . We recall that the spectral density of  n(t) is just 
2 2 , and since
equation (11) implies the following relation between the Fourier transforms  X(
)
)  and  N(
of the two processes

and thus we conclude that Brownian motion has a 1/f2 spectrum.
A random walk in velocity space does not yield a very different result: now we start with the
Langevin equation for the velocity v(t) with no external forces

- i X(

) = N(

)

we see that the spectral density of x is

2

2

=

Sx

2

dv
dt

+ v(t) = n(t)

and then we find

- i V(

) + V(

) = N(

)

and the spectral density of the velocity

(11)

(12)

(13)

(14)

(15)

The position x(t) is the time integral of the velocity v(t) and therefore the relationship between
their respective spectra is

2

Sv

(

2 + 2

2

= Sv

Sx

so that the spectrum of the position x(t) is

2

=

Sx

(

2

2 + 2

2

)

which falls off like the spectrum of Brownian motion at low frequency, and much faster at high
frequency. These formulas show that neither Brownian motion in position space nor Brownian
motion in velocity space can adequately describe 1/f noise, at least in one space dimension only:
the spectrum falls off too fast.
We know that Brownian motion describes a simple diffusion process, but maybe a more general
diffusion  process  could  do  the  trick  and  lead  us  to  1/f   spectra,  so  we  drop  the  Langevin
equation  for  Brownian  motion  and  turn  to  the  diffusion  equation  with  a  random  driving  term
[19]:

where  p  is  a  probability  density  function  and  f  is  a  random  driving  term,  and  the  observed
process r is related to p by the integral formula

where g is a coupling factor. Let P and F be the Fourier transforms defined by

It is not difficult to derive a 1/f spectrum from expression (24) with the proper assumptions on
G  and  A,  but  it  is  much  more  difficult  to  give  physical  meaning  to  these  mathematical
assumptions (see the discussion in [19]). Several authors (including myself [20]) have tried to
give meaning to the diffusion approach, but the final word has not been written yet.
Before moving on to the next topic it is important to notice that the diffusion equation can be
easily discretized on a square lattice, and in 2 space dimensions we obtain the following discrete
version:

p j ,k(t + D t) - p j, k(t) = D

We shall return to equation (25) in section 6.

5. Statistical properties

The  noise  spectrum  is  certainly  important,  but  it  is  not  all:  already  J.  B.  Johnson  in  his  1925
experiment  [3]  looked  for  other  characteristics  of  flicker  noise  in  vacuum  tubes,  like  the
dependence on total current of the noise density, etc.
And indeed, the spectral density characterizes a noise process completely only if the process is
stationary, ergodic and Gaussian: does the observed 1/ f noise satisfy all these constraints? How
else can we characterize 1/ f noise?
These questions are answered at least partly in the literature on 1/ f noise in electronic devices,
and here I concentrate on three important properties2.

2 Most of the early research was centered on conductors, and other properties like isotropy were tested:
the interested reader can turn to the excellent reviews of Dutta and Horn [19], Weissmann [21] and Kogan
[22].

(cid:242)
5.1 Is noise present at equilibrium?
The work of many physicist and in particular of F. N. Hooge and collaborators [23], produced
several empirical formulas for 1/f noise in resistors, and in particular Hooge [24] showed that
the 1/f voltage spectral density can be parametrized by the formula

SV ( f ) =

2 +
VDC
Nc f

(26)

, 

 and   are constants, VDC is the applied voltage and Nc is the total number of charge
where 
carriers in the sample. This formula relates 1/f noise to the passage of current in the sample, and
so people asked whether the noise was still present without a driving current. The problem was
settled experimentally by Clarke and Voss [25] who found that 1/f noise was indeed present at
equilibrium and this result was later confirmed by Beck and Spruit [26]. The conclusion is true
with a caveat: in the experiment there was no driving current, but there was also no guarantee of
thermal equilibrium.

5.2 Is the noise process stationary?
Let  us  recall  that  a  stochastic  process  x  is  stationary  in  a  strict  sense  when  the  ensemble
averages  x(t) ,  x(t)x(t +
2) , ..., do not depend on time. We have
already seen that  1/f noise has some disturbing divergences: in practical terms this means that
when we take an experimental record it may grow without limits, and it may superficially look
like a deterministic process with the addition of white noise, i.e. 1/f noise may easily simulate
an  instrumental  drift  with  a  time-varying  average,  so  that  one  may  wonder  if  this  noise  is
actually stationary.
In 1969 Brophy [27] found that the zero-crossing statistics was Poissonian, just what one would
expect from a stationary process, while shortly later Brophy and Greenstein [28] reported traces
of nonstationarity. A few other papers followed, untili in 1975 Stoisiek and Wolf found that the
statistical properties of 1/f noise were "fully consistent with the assumption of stationarity".

5.3. Is the process Gaussian?
There are two important reasons to answer this question: in the first place a Gaussian process is
completely  characterized  by  its  average  value  and  by  the  spectral  density;  secondly  linear
processes – like simple diffusion – are always Gaussian, therefore Gaussianity is an important
clue of linearity at the microscopic level.
To demostrate linearity Voss [29] produced experimental plots of the quantity  V(t) V0 V0 in
several conductors, and he related these plots to both linearity and Gaussianity: however these
plots  do  not  really  demostrate  linearity,  they  just  show  that  the  noise  processes  observed  by
Voss were reasonably Gaussian..
Later several groups reported non-Gaussian signals (see, e.g., [30]), but Gaussianity can always
be  recovered  at  the  macroscopic  level  from  the  superposition  of  many  microscopic  processes
(this is a manifestation of the central limit theorem).
From the theoretical point of view linearity is not welcome, since many attempts to understand
1/f noise are actually based on nonlinear processes.

Notice that the properties that we have discussed in this section have been tested on conductors
only, i.e. on one very special subset of the systems that display 1/f noise, therefore we cannot
draw any general conclusion from these observations.

6. Self organized criticality

The  outstanding  feature  of  1/f  noise  is  that  it  is  scale  invariant,  i.e.  it  looks  the  same  for  any
choice of frequency or time unit, and for this reason it has been widely considered a prominent
manifestation  of  the  fractal  character  of  many  natural  phenomena.  Since  many  nonlinear
processes have complex phase spaces with fractal attractors, several physicists have looked into
nonlinear processes as sources of 1/f noise.

In 1987 Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld (BTW) introduced a nonlinear model system that was met
with  wide  interest  and  has  since  generated  spates  of  scientific  papers,  the  so-called  Sandpile
Model [31,32]: the title of the original paper was Self Organized Criticality: An Explanation of
1/f Noise, and it put forward a very ambitious program, as it described a nonlinear process that
had  fractal  characteristics,  a  complex  behaviour  that  mimicked  a  noise  process,  a  spectral
density that the authors claimed to be 1/f, and displayed a limiting behavior that was called self
organized criticality.
The  sandpile  model  is  closely  related  to  an  earlier  classical  model  developed  to  describe  the
charge-density  waves  observed  in  some  special  conductors  like  NbSe3  or  K0.3MoO3  (see  [33]
and  [34]  for  very  readable  reviews  or  [35]  for  a  more  technical  one):  in  this  model  a  charge-
density wave may be viewed as a single particle (or an array of particles) in a periodic or quasi-
periodic potential (see figure 10).

Figure  10:  classical  model  for  charge-density-wave  conduction  (from  [35]):  when  pinning
impurities  are  present  the  troughs  have  variable  depths.  Here  a  charge-density  wave  may  be
viewed  as  a  single  particle  in  a  periodic  or  quasi-periodic  potential  and  this  simplified  model
closely resembles the "many-pendula" model introduced by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld in [31]
to describe self-organized criticality.

BTW  introduced  a  coupled-pendula  model  of  self  organized  criticality  but  the  analogy  with
sand  proved  to  be  so  suggestive,  that  soon  only  the  sandpile  paradigm  survived  in  the
literature3:.  The  two-dimensional  version  of  the  model  is  described  mathematically  by  the
discrete evolution equations

where zj,k  is  an  integer  variable  that  may  be  taken  to  represent  the  height  differences  between
adjacent  nodes  in  a  two-dimensional  lattice,  and  K  is  a  threshold  value.  When  we  compare
equations  (25)  and  (27)  we  see  that  the  dynamics  described  by  (27)  represent  a  discrete,
nonlinear diffusion process.
Being discrete and nonlinear, the sandpile model is very hard to study with the usual analytical
tools,  but  it  can  easily  be  adapted  to  large  scale  numerical  calculations  and  in  [32]  BTW
reported 1/f  spectral densities obtained from their numerical simulations, with 
BTW also argued that the sandpile model exhibits a form of self-organization as the slope of the
sandpile  approaches  a  limiting  value,  just  as  in  real  sandpiles  (in  plain  words  the  diffusion
process  cannot  proceed  until  the  threshold  K  is  reached)  and  they  dubbed  it  Self  Organized
Criticality (SOC).
Papers  [31]  and  [32]  initiated  a  flurry  of  activity  as  many  physicists  tried  to  replicate  BTW's
results,  either  with  their  own  numerical  simulations  or  with  direct  simulations  of  sand  flows,
and  sometimes  also  with  more  sophisticated  analytical  tools  like  the  renormalization  group
approach.  However  most  of  these  studies  have  widened  the  scope  of  application  of  SOC  and
have  not  led  to  a  deeper  understanding  of  the  behavior  of  the  model,  which  remains
controversial.  For  instance,  there  are  applications  of  SOC  to  fields  as  diverse  as  fire
propagation[37] or evolutionary biology[38,39], but alongside the enthusiastic attitudes of some
physicists (see, e.g. [40]) there is an increasing number of papers that raise doubts on the model
validity and actual applicability.
The study of 1/f noise started in electronics, and we have already seen that electrical 1/f noise
seems to be stationary and Gaussian, but the pulses of sandpiles are not Gaussian, and the other
statistical properties differ from those of the observed electrical 1/f noise as well [41]; moreover
electrical  1/f  noise  exists  at  equilibrium  while  all  SOC  models  require  an  external  driving
process. Another point that remains highly controversial is the reality of the claimed 1/f spectra:
 1) or are they trivial  1/f2 spectra? If they were just 1/f2 spectra,
are they 1/f  spectra (with 
then  SOC  would  not  be  essentially  different  from  a  simple  Brownian  process  (see  section  4),
and  therefore  it  is  essential  to  establish  the  numerical  value  of  the  exponent.  Jaeger,  Liu  and
Nagel  performed  an  experiment  with  a  real  sandpile  in  1988  [42,43]  and  their  results
contradicted  BTW's  claims,  they  did  not  observe  a  1/f   spectrum,  but  rather  a  white  noise
plateau – modified at low frequency by grain size effects – followed by a 1/f2 tail.
Jensen, Christensen and Fogedby added mathematical substance to the measurements of Jaeger,
Liu and Nagel [43], and they demostrated that the spectra in real sandpiles are actually 1/f2 [44].
The problem of establishing the exponent has been aggravated by serious errors in the literature,
like in ref. [45], where the authors claimed to have found a sandpile model with a 1/f spectrum,
while they actually found a 1/f2 spectrum and forgot to square the Fourier coefficients.
 „
The importance of finding 1/f  spectra with 
 2 seems to have escaped the attention of some
authors  like  Dalton  and  Corcoran,  who  recently  performed  another  experiment  on  a  granular
system [46], found a trivial 1/f2 spectrum and conclude that this is in accordance with SOC.

On the whole it does not seem that SOC adequately describes 1/f noise, nor that it can actually
aspire to the universality that its supporters claim4.

7. Earthquakes

After  Mandelbrot's  work,  1/f  noise  has  often  been  associated  to  fractal  phenomena  and  other
power  laws,  and  the  physics  of  earthquakes  is  just  one  of  those  fields  where  the  concepts  of
scaling – which leads to power laws – and later of SOC, seem to be applicable. The mainstay of
this  field  is  the  celebrated  Gutenberg-Richter  law  [48]  which  states  that  N(M),  the  number  of
earthquakes  with  magnitude  greater 
i.e.
log10 N(M) = A - bM   where  the  slope  b  is  found  to  be  a  number  near  1.  There  is  also  a
classical  earthquake  model  with  dissipative  nonlinear  dynamics,  the  Burridge-Knopoff  model
[49],  so  that  the  challenge  lies  in  solving  the  Burridge-Knopoff  model  –  or  another  similar
model – to retrieve the Gutenberg-Richter law, and other earthquake statistics.

I  have  used  the  data  available  from  an  online  earthquake  database  [50],  to  plot  a  Gutenberg-
Richter distribution for the year 2000, and the result is shown in figure 11.

Figure 11: cumulative distribution N of the earthquakes worldwide for the year 2000 from the
Berkeley  database  [50]:  the  red  line  has  slope  -1.  Since  the  earhtquake  magnitude  is  a
logarithmic measure of the energy released by the earthquake, this may be viewed as a log-log
plot.  Notice  that  the  power  law  region  has  a  limited  extension,  approximately  3  decades,  i.e.
considerably less than the power law region in resistor noise spectra.

                                                
4 One may also wonder if sandpiles are as universally applicable as the supporters claim: see ref. [47] for
a historian's opinion.

Figure 11 shows that there is indeed a magnitude range where a power law holds, while there is
a low magnitude region where the power law breaks down. Does the Burridge-Knopoff model
explain all of this? The Burridge-Knopoff model is a simple block-and-spring model of a crustal
fault  (see  figure  12)  originally  introduced  in  1967,  and  it  has  been  extensively  studied  [51],
especially by Carlson and collaborators [52,53].

Figure 12: in the Burridge-Knopoff model there are blocks that slide on a plane with friction, as
they  are  drawn  forward  by  an  upper  plate  that  moves  with  constant  speed.  Each  block  is
connected to the adjacent blocks by springs. This is the simplified model of a fault introduced
by Burridge and Knopoff in 1967 [49]: a nice JAVA simulation is also available online [54].

Figure  13:  frequency  distribution  of  the  slip  events  (earthquakes)  of  magnitude 
[53]. Notice the large bump that corresponds to an excess of events of high magnitude.

  taken  from

Figure  13  shows  the  results  of  the  simulations  in  [53]:  it  looks  like  the  intuitive  Burridge-
Knopoff model breaks down at high magnitude. Actually the plot in figure 13 is the frequency
distribution of slip events, not the cumulative distribution as in the Gutenberg-Richter law, but
the  derivative  of  a  power  law  is  stilla  a  power  law,  so  one  would  not  expect  a  very  different

situation if one took the frequency distribution of earthquakes. However this is not so, because
the  Gutenberg-Richter  law  is  a  power  law  only  in  a  rather  limited  magnitude  range,  and  the
frequency distribution of earthquakes – the same quakes that were used to produce figure 11 – 
has a very different look (figure 14), very similar to the one in figure 13.
Earthquakes are complex phenomena, and the restricted power law range may come from some
fundamental difference in physics between small and large magnitude earthquakes [55,56]: here
we  can  conclude  that  whatever  the  origin  of  the  breakdown,  the  concept  of  scale  invariance
seems to have a very limited applicability to earthquakes.

Berkeley  database  [50]  (histogram  bins  have  a  0.1  magnitude  width):  notice  the  large  bump
around magnitude 4. Should we identify the boxed region with the frequency distribution shown
in figure 13?

8. 1/f noise in deterministic dynamical systems

One explanation of the occurrence of 1/f noise in resistors is that the charge carriers get trapped
in  capture  sites  and  are  released  with  variable  rates  (this  is  essentially  the  extension  of
Schottky's original explanation of 1/f noise in vacuum tubes), and in the search for a "universal"
explanation  of  1/f  noise  one  may  wonder  if  the  same  mechanism  may  act  in  more  general
dynamical systems. Geisel, Zacherl and Radons (GRZ) [57] devised just one such mechanism :
it  is  well  known  that  if  we  are  given  a  random  Hamiltonian  its  phase  space  splits  in  chaotic
regions where the system point follows pseudoorbits and in ordered regions where the system
point follows periodic orbits (this is the essence of the KAM theorem). The ordered regions are
often surrounded by a hierarchi of cantori, and the conjecture of GRZ is that the system point
gets temporarily trapped in these cantori and is released with variable rates, just as the charge
carriers  in  an  ordinary  conductor  with  trapping  sites.  GRZ  considered  in  particolar  a  classical
particle in a periodic two-dimensional potential

V(x,y) = A + B cos x + cos y

(

(see figure 15), and solved numerically the coupled equations of motion

Figure  15:  two-dimensional  periodic  potential  used  by  Geisel,  Zacherl  and  Radons  [57].  GRZ
took  A=2.5,  B=1.5  and  C=0.5,  and  the  total  energy  E=4,  so  that  the  maximum  value  of  the
potential is 6, and the particle performs a complex motion amid the peaks of the potential.

The particle performs a complex motion amid the many peaks of the potential, which looks like
a sort of random walk (figure 16), while the velocity of the particle looks like a periodic signal
plus noise: figure 17 shows the spectral density of the y velocity fluctuations which do have a
peak plus a 1/f noise background before the peak.

Figure 16: plot of the (x,y) position of the particle, which starts from (1.5,1.5) in this simulation:
the particle performs a kind of random walk.

Hamiltonian.  There  is  a  1/f  part  followed  by  a  peak  from  a  periodic  signal  (the  system  point
orbits around limit cycles).

Figure 19: there is a whole hierarchi of cantori around the central island in figure 17. According
to  GRZ  the  particle  is  trapped  in  these  cantori  and  this  produces  the  observed  1/f  spectral
density (adapted from ref. [57]).

The  dynamical  system  of  GRZ  is  a  Hamiltonian  system,  i.e.  it  belongs  to  a  specific  subclass,
however  in  physics  there  are  non-Hamiltonian  systems  as  well,  like  the  celebrated  Lorentz
system

which has been extensively studied since its first appearance in 1963 [58,59]. Systems like this
have many interesting features, such as stable limit cycles, strange attractors, intermittency and
1/f noise. Intermittent behavior is characterized by a seemingly stationary signal interrrupted by
bursts of activity, as in figure 20 (see refs. [60,61,62]).

The fundamental work of Feingebaum on the transition to chaos in the logistic map has shown
that simple functions may be used as representatives of a much wider class of functions [63]:
the function

which maps the (0,1) interval into itself has been used to study both intermittence and power-
law noise in dynamical systems [61,64,65]. Repeated iteration of the map (31) yields a sequence

which  has  both  an  intermittent  behavior  and  a  very  clean  1/f  spectral  density  (figure  21).
Schuster and Procaccia have [63] shown theoretically that this is a real 1/f spectral density using
the Feingebaum renormalization group method in function space [63].
It  is  important  to  notice  that  the  fluctuations  produced  by  the  dynamical  systems  discussed  in
this  section  are  far  from  Gaussian,  and  therefore  the  spectral  densities  are  not  sufficient  to
characterize the processes.

9. An example from biophysics

As  an  example  of  a  biophysical  system  in  which  1/f  noise  is  actually  observed,  I  wish  to
mention  the  fluctuations  of  the  electrical  dipole  moment  of  lysozome,  an  important  enzyme.

This is a very interesting physical system inasmuch as it provides information on the structure
of  water  and  on  its  interaction  with  biological  molecules  [66].  The  fluctuations  have  been
studied by Careri and Consolini [67] and the spectral density is once again a 1/f  spectrum, with

Figure  22:  high-frequency  noise  exponent  for  the  1/f   spectral  density  of  electric  dipole
fluctuations in hydrated lysozome powder as a function of temperature, as measured by Careri
and Consolini [67].

We believe that the electrical dipole fluctuations are due to the migration of free protons on the
molecule surface, and to test this model we have set up a Monte Carlo simulation [68]. Figure
23 shows a simulated dipole signal, and the average spectral density for many such signals: the
first results obtained with this approach are encouraging, as we find good values for the noise
exponent and reasonable dependencies on the other physical parameters. The spectral density in
this model is a good example of the discussion of section 2, since it is found that the distribution
of transition rates between different proton states follows a power law, and therefore produces a
1/f   spectral  density.  The  individual  signals  are  non-Gaussian,  but  the  macroscopic  signal  is  a
superposition of many such signals, and thus it is Gaussian.

Figure 23: simulated dipole signal (x component) for a single molecule. Signals such as this are
seen in conventional conductors as well (see, e.g. [69]).

Figure  24:  a.  frequency  distribution  of  relaxation  rates;  b.  spectral  density  of  the  dipole
fluctuation  (dipole  projected  along  a  given  direction)  averaged  over  several  molecules
(dB(Debye,  rms)  vs.  log(frequency  (a.u.)).  The  distribution  in  a.  closely  follows  a  power-law,
and therefore the results of section 2 apply to this case. The steep rise in b. at low frequency is
due  to  an  uncorrected  DC  component.  The  rise  at  high  frequency  is  due  to  unfiltered  high-
frequencies (it is an aliasing effect). The red line shows a 1/f1.7 spectral density.

10. Numerical simulation 1/f  noise

We  have  seen  simple  dynamical  processes  that  generate  non-Gaussian  1/f  noise,  but  in  most
cases  one  in  interested  in  simulating  Gaussian  1/f  noise:  there  is  a  simple  and  reasonably  fast
algorithm  that  generates  colored  Gaussian  noise  [70],  which  is  based  on  the  following  simple

time series [71].  Figure 25 shows examples of time series generated with this algorithm

11. 1/f noise literature (including online resources)

There is a vast literature on 1/f noise and we have barely touched the surface in this review. I
have neglected several interesting approaches such as that based on the log-normal distribution
[72,73]  and  resistor  noise  as  a  percolative  process  [74-79].  Many  references  to  older  material
can be found in previous reviews [6,14,19,21,22,80,81].
There  are  also  many  interesting  online  resources,  in  particular  there  is  a  site  dedicated  to  1/f
noise, mantained by W. Li [82].

12. Conclusions

I  conclude  with  a  word  of  caution,  these  noises  are  beautiful  physical  phenomena,  but  we
should  beware  of  pitfalls:  I  have  already  mentioned  the  missing  square  in  paper  [45]  (the
authors of that paper wrongly claimed they had found a 1/f spectral density): strangely enough,
this mistake has been repeated many times, for instance in the original paper of BTW [32] and
later in [83] (erratum in [84]).

In this review we have studied several mechanisms that produce fluctuations with a 1/f  spectral
density: do we have by now an "explanation" of the apparent universality of flicker noises? Do
we  understand  1/f  noise?  My  impression  is  that  there  is  no  real  mistery  behind 1/f  noise,  that
there is no real universality and that in most cases the observed 1/f noises have been explained
by beautiful and mostly ad hoc models.

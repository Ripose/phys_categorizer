A cluster theory based mathematical model was developed and used to simulate the dynamics 

of a system composed of a large number of interacting agents-clusters with different size. The 

case of a system formed by a constant total number of economic units (agents) in metastable 

(partial)  equilibrium  was  considered,  and  the  size  effect  on  the  formation  of  the  groups 

(clusters)  of  agents  was  particularly  elucidated.  We  prove  that  the  fragmentation  and 

coagulation rates of groups of agents definitely depend on the size of the group. 

 

 

1. Introduction 

The mathematical modeling in economics is a very important tool for investigation of economic 
and financial processes. In particular, many papers were recently published in the field of application of 
the methods of statistical physics, thermodynamics, synergetics etc. in economics [1-5], and they are on 
the  increase.  Each  economic  sector  formed  by  many  agents  that  interact  reciprocally  has  some  similar 
features with physical systems which are composed by many different components or so-called cluster-
structures. In general, a cluster represents an aggregate formed by a number of similar elements that are 
thought to be unitary and indivisible. 

Meanwhile, the notion of economic or financial cluster, which assumes, for instance, the division 
of  market  in  similar  elements,  can  be  used  in  mathematical  modeling.  The  future  segmentation  of  the 
market can be done regarding these components, and the examination of each segment as an aggregate of 
clusters of a certain size in the units of reference used initially in the process of separation can be justified 

by the fact that the economic systems have a complex evolving structure, e.g. the firms competing in an 
economy are composed by divisions. In the case of a perfect competition, in order to avoid the appearance 
of  non-aggregative  processes,  we  shall  consider  a  closed  system  of  economic  or  financial  structures, 
without the input/output flows, i.e. a system formed by a constant total number of economic or financial 
agents  in  partial  equilibrium  which  supposes  the  existence  of  some  possibilities  for  a  new  optimum 
redistribution of money and goods on the market. This situation is analogous to the realization of a local 
minimum  of  the  Gibbs  free  energy  in  the  cluster  theory  [1,  6].  Thus,  a  stable  economic  development 
assumes an evolution of the system to such partition of money and goods which corresponds to the deeper 
thermodynamic minimum of energy, that is the truly stable equilibrium state of the system. 
 
The  notion  of  cluster  is  used  in  the  next  paragraphs  with  the  meaning  of  a  complex  structure 
formed by a number of similar economic or financial units which interact on the market within a closed 
system of structures (agents) with different size. Analytical and numerical study of the influence of the

size  of  the  clusters  on  their  formation  and  evolution  in  conditions  of  partial  equilibrium  and  perfect 
competition is the aim of this paper. 
 
 

2. Mathematical model 

In  the  framework  of  the  cluster  approach  the  following  two  basic  assumptions,  which  allow  a 
mathematical formalism to be developed for a detailed description of the evolution, are indispensable [6]: 
(i)  There exist clusters in the initial state which consist of different number n of elements (n=1, 

2, …), 

(ii)  Transformations of n-sized clusters into m-sized ones at time t occur with certain, in general, 

time-dependent frequencies fnm(t)(s-1) (n, m=1, 2, …).  

The  evolution  of  the  process  is  sought  to  be  described  by  function  Zn(t),  which  represents  the 
solution  of  the  kinetic  master  equation  and  characterizes  the  time-dependence  of  the  concentration  of 
clusters of size n. Figure 1 shows schematically how n-sized cluster can increase or decrease its size. In 
particular, the arrow beginning from size n and ending at size m on the size axis symbolizes the quantity 
fnm(t)Zn(t),  which  gives  the  number  of  n→m 
transitions  undergone  by  the  n-sized  clusters  per 

fmnZm

fnmZn

the 

time,  divided  by 

unit 
total  number  of 
interacting  agents-clusters  with  different  size  N. 
Then,  the  concentration  of  clusters  of  size  n  will 
be diminished per unit time by the quantity:  

f

nm

tZt
)(
n

, 

(1) 

where  M  is  the  total  number  of  economical  units 
(agents)  existing  in  the  system.  Conversely,  the 
arrows  ending  at  size  n  illustrate  the  role  of  the 
reverse,  i.e.  the  m→n,  transitions:  owing  to  them 
Zn(t) will increase per unit time by the quantity:

changes in the size of a cluster of n units. 

On  the  other  hand,  the  change  of  Zn(t)  per  unit  time  is  expressed  mathematically  by  the  derivative 
dZn(t)/dt. The balance between the above quantities thus leads to the sought master equation for a closed 
system:

Equation (3) is a set of ordinary differential equations of first order. In general, these equations are non-
linear because of the dependence of the transition frequencies on the unknown cluster concentration Zn(t). 

Clearly,  Zn(t)  and  M  are  connected  by  the  relation

distribution Zn(0) is considered to be a priori known.  
 

We  can  now  study  easily  the  processes  of  type  [Z1]+[Zn]↔[Zn+1],  occurring  especially  at  the 
early stages, when it is unlikely for the clusters of n=2, 3, … units to interact, because their concentration 
is  still  rather  low.  This  is  illustrated  in  Figure  2 in  which  the  arrows  symbolize  the  number  of  forward

where fnm(t)=0 for │n-m│>1 and fnm(t)≠0 only for │n-m│=1, the clusters will change size by nearest-size 
transitions and the equation (3) becomes:

concentration  Z1  equals  their  equilibrium  concentration 
C1,  is  Z1(0)=C1,  and  Zn(0)=0  (n=2,  3,  …,  M).  The 
boundary  conditions  for  the  unknown  cluster  size 
distribution, in conformity with the assumption that the 
actual  concentration  of  units  in  a  system  in  partial 
equilibrium is equal to the equilibrium one, are Z1(t)=C1 
and  ZM(t)=0.  We  shall  require  Z1(t)  to  remain  constant 
with time, and this assumption is based on the fact that 
Z1  and  C1  are  thought  to  be  large  numbers.  Thus, 
equation  (4)  becomes  a  set  of  M-2  ordinary  linear 
differential equations of first order in the M-2 unknowns 
Z2(t), Z3(t), …, ZM-1(t).

The first step in solving equation (4) is to homogenize it by presenting Zn(t) in form of the sum of 

where yn(t) satisfies the initial condition yn(0)=-Xn , and dyn(t)/dt=fn-1yn-1(t)-(fn+gn)yn(t)+gn+1yn+1(t) (n=2, 3, 
…, M-1) which is a set of M-2 already homogeneous ordinary linear differential equations of first order 
with time-independent coefficients. For any fixed n=2, 3, …, M-1 we shall have M-2 linearly independent 
particular solutions yni(t) of the form:  
 
where ani are constants (to ensure the linear independence of yni(t) we shall require that not all ani equal 
zero simultaneously), and λi>0 is the ith eigenvalue, i.e. the ith root of the characteristic equation  

yni(t)=ani exp(-λit) (i=2, 3, …, M-1),

The above determinant represents a polynomial of degree M-2 which has M-2 simple roots λ2, λ3, …, λM-1. 
The  next  step  is,  therefore,  to  find  these  roots,  and  then  to  determine,  for  each  i=2,  3,  …,  M-1,  the 
constants ani with the help of the recursion formulae:  
(f2+g2-λi)a2i-g3a3i=0,

is the stationary cluster size distribution divided by its equilibrium value X1.  
 
Equations (12) or (13) represent the time-dependent cluster size distribution which has an origin 
at no preexisting clusters in the system. We note that, as it should be, Zn(t)→Xn for t→∞. Meanwhile, the 
exact  expressions  for  the  roots  λi  can  be  found  analytically  only  for  M-2≤4,  i.e.  for  M≤6.  For  M>6  we 
must resort to numerical methods for solving the problem.  
 

3. Results and discussions  

The  relative  increase  with  time  of  the  quantity  of  n-sized  agents-clusters  was  numerically 
simulated and the results for M=7 (n=2, 3, …, 6) and M=12 (n=2, 3, …, 11) are shown in Figures 3 and 4, 
respectively. We can conclude that the functions that approximate analytically the curvatures presented in

4. Conclusion  

A cluster theory based mathematical model was developed and applied qualitatively to the study 
of  the  size  dependence  of  the  development  of  relatively  small  economic  agents-clusters,  and  for  short-
time periods we proved that the fragmentation and coagulation rates of groups of agents depend on their 
size.  
 
The  model  could  be  developed  further  for  the  behavior  of  large  groups  of  agents  in  a  more 
complex environment which is closer to an actual economic situation, as well as for the presence of the 
input and output flows of money and goods on the market.

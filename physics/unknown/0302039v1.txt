hypothesis  that  the  axonal  caliber  has  evolved  to  minimize  signal
propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume to a minimum. We

Multi-cellular organisms have solved the problem of efficient transport of  nutrients
and  communication  between  their  body  parts  by  evolving  spectacular  networks:
trees,  blood  vessels,  bronchs,  and  neuronal  arbors.  These  networks  consist  of
segments bifurcating into thinner and thinner branches. Understanding of branching
in transport networks has been advanced through the application of the optimization
theory  ([1],  [2]  and  references  therein).  Here  we  apply  the  optimization  theory  to
explain the caliber of branching segments in communication networks, i.e. neuronal
axons.

Axons  in  different  organisms  vary  in  caliber  from  0.1Pm  (terminal  segments  in
neocortex) to 1000Pm (squid giant axon) [3]. What factors could be responsible for
such  variation  in  axon  caliber?  According  to  the  experimental  data  [4]  and  cable
theory [5], thicker axons conduct action potential  faster, leading to  shorter reaction
times  and,  perhaps,  quicker  thinking.  This  increases  evolutionary  fitness  or,
equivalently, reduces costs associated with conduction delays. So, why not make all
the  axons  infinitely  thick?  It  is  likely  that  thick  axons  are  evolutionary  costly
because they require large amount of cytoplasm and occupy valuable space [6], [7].
Then,  is  there  an  optimal  axon  caliber,  which  minimizes  the  combined  cost  of
conduction delays and volume?

In  this  paper  we  derive  an  expression  for  the  optimal  axon  diameter,  which
minimizes the combined cost of conduction delay and volume. Although the relative
cost  of  delay  and  volume  is  unknown,  we  use  this  expression  to  derive  a  law
describing segment caliber of branching axons with no free parameters. We test this
law on the published anatomical data and find a satisfactory agreement.

2  Deri va ti on   of  th e  b ran ch i n g l aw

Although our theory holds for a rather general class of cost functions (see Methods),
we start, for the sake of  simplicity, by deriving the branching law  in a  special case
of  a  linear  cost  function.  Detrimental  contribution  to  fitness,  # ,  of  an  axonal
segment of length,  L , can be represented as the sum of two terms, one proportional
to  the  conduction  delay  along  the  segment,  T ,  and  the  other  -  to  the  segment
volume, V :

Here,  D   and  E   are  unknown  but  constant  coefficients  which  reflect  the  relative
contribution  to  the  fitness  cost  of  the  signal  propagation  delay  and  the  axonal
volume.

Figure 1: Fitness cost of a myelinated axonal segment as a function of its diameter.
The  lines  show  the  volume  cost,  the  delay  cost,  and  the  total  cost.  Notice  that  the
total  cost  has  a  minimum.  Diameter  and  cost  values  are  normalized  to  their
respective optimal values.

We look for the axon caliber  d  that minimizes the cost function  # . To do this, we
rewrite  #   as  a  function  of  d   by  noticing  the  following  relations:  i)  Volume,

The  utility  of  this  result  may  seem  rather  limited  because  the  relative  cost  of  time
delays vs. volume, D E , is unknown.

Figure  2:  A  simple  axonal  arbor  with  a  single  branch  point  and  three  axonal
segments. Segment diameters are d0, d1, and d2. Time delays along each segment are
t0, t1, and t2. The total time delay down the first branch is T1= t0 +t1, and the second -
T2= t0 +t2.

However,  we  can  apply  this  result  to  axonal  branching  and  arrive  at  a  testable
prediction  about  the  relationship  among  branch  diameters  without  knowing  the
relative  cost.  To  do  this  we  write  the  cost  function  for  a  bifurcation  consisting  of
three segments, Fig. 2:

make the dependence on the diameters explicit and differentiate in respect  to them.
Because  each  term  in  Eq.  (5)  depends  on  the  diameter  of  only  one  segment  the
variables separate and we arrive at expressions analogous to Eq.(3):

It is easy to see that these diameters satisfy the following branching law:

(cid:14)

 

Similar  expression  can  be  derived  for  non-myelinated  axons  (see  Methods).  In  this
case,  the  conduction  velocity  scales  with  the  square  root  of  segment  diameter,
resulting in a branching exponent of  2.5 .

We note that expressions analogous to Eq. (7) have been derived for blood vessels,
tree  branching  and  bronchs  by  balancing  metabolic  cost  of  pumping  viscous  fluid
and  volume  cost  [8],  [9].  Application  of  viscous  flow  to  dendrites  has  been
discussed  in  [10].  However,  it  is  hard  to  see  how  dendrites  could  be  conduits  to
viscous fluid if their ends are sealed.

Rall  [11]  has  derived  a  similar  law  for  branching  dendrites  by  postulating
impedance matching:

However,  the  main  purpose  of  Rall’s  law  was  to  simplify  calculations  of  dendritic
conduction rather than to explain the actual branch caliber measurements.

We  test  our  branching  law,  Eq.(7),  by  comparing  it  with  the  data  obtained  from
myelinated  motor  fibers  of  the  cat  [12],  Fig.  3.  Data  points  represent  63  branch
points  for  which  all  three  axonal  calibers  were  available.  Eq.(7)  predicts  that  the
data should fall on the line described by:

Analysis  of  the  experimental  data  reveals  a  large  spread  in  the  values  of  the
exponent,  K .  This  spread  may  arise  from  the  biological  variability  in  the  axon
diameters,  other  factors  influencing  axon  diameters,  or  measurement  errors  due  to
the  finite  resolution  of  light  microscopy.  Although  we  cannot  distinguish  between
these  causes,  we  performed  a  simulation  showing  that  a  reasonable  measurement
error is sufficient to account for the spread.

0d , 

First,  based  on  the  experimental  data  [12],  we  generate  a  set  of  diameters 

1d
2d   at  branch  points,  which  satisfy  Eq.  (7).  We  do  this  by  taking  all  diameter
and 
pairs  at  branch  point  from  the  experimental  data  and  calculating  the  value  of  the
third  diameter  according  to  Eq.  (7).  Next  we  simulate  the  experimental  data  by
adding  Gaussian  noise  to  all  branch  diameters,  and  calculate  the  probability
distribution  for  the  exponent  K   resulting  from  this  procedure.  The  line  in  Fig.  4
shows that the spread in the histogram of branching exponent could be explained by
Gaussian  measurement  error  with  standard  deviation  of  0.4 mP .  This  value  of
standard  deviation  is  consistent  with  0.5 mP   precision  with  which  diameter
measurements are reported in [12].

 

Figure 4: Experimentally observed spread in the branching exponent may arise from
the  measurement  errors.  The  histogram  shows  the  distribution  of  the  exponent  K ,
Eq.  (9),  calculated  for  each  axonal  bifurcation  [12].  The  average  exponent  is
. The line shows the simulated distribution of the exponent obtained in the

Starting with the hypotheses that axonal arbors had been optimized in the course of
evolution  for  fast  signal  conduction  while  keeping  arbor  volume  to  a  minimum  we
derived  a  branching  law  that  relates  segment  diameters  at  a  branch  point.  The
derivation  was  done  for  the  cost  function  of  a  general  form,  and  relies  only  on  the
known  scaling  of  signal  propagation  velocity  with  the  axonal  caliber.  This  law  is
consistent  with the available experimental  data  on  myelinated  axons.  The  observed
spread  in  the  branching  exponent  may  be  accounted  for  by  the  measurement  error.
More experimental testing is clearly desirable.

We note that similar considerations could be applied to dendrites. There, similar to
non-myelinated  axons,  time  delay  or  attenuation  of  passively  propagating  signals
scales as one over the square root of diameter.  This leads to  a  branching  law  with
exponent  of  5 2 .  However,  the  presence  of  reflections  from  branch  points  and
active conductances is likely to complicate the picture.

The  detrimental  contribution  of  an  axonal  arbor  to  the  evolutionary  fitness  can  be
quantified  by  the  cost,  # .  We  postulate  that  the  cost  function,  # ,  is  a
monotonically increasing function of the total axonal volume per neuron,  V , and all
signal propagation delays, 

jT , from soma to  j -th synapse, where

Although  we  derive  Eq.  (11)  for  a  single  branch  point,  our  theory  can  be  trivially
extended  to  more  complex  arbor  topologies.  We  rewrite  the  cost  function,  # ,  in
iV ,  of  i -th  axonal  segment  to  the  total  volume  of
terms  of  volume  contributions,

Next,  we  express  volume  and  signal  propagation  delay  of  each  segment  as  a

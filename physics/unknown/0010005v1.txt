Abstract

Here  we  present  designs  for  a  static  septum  magnet
with two adjacent apertures where ideally one aperture has
a  uniform  dipole  field  and  the  other  zero  field.  Two
designs are considered. One is  a true septum  magnet with
a thin  layer  of  coils  and  materials  separating  the  dipole
field region from the  null  field region.  During  the  beam
switching  process,  the  intense  electron  beam  will  spray
across this  material septum  leading to  concerns on  beam
control, vacuum quality, radiation damage, etc.  due to  the
lost  particles. Therefore, another configuration  without  a
material 
this
configuration  it  is  more  difficult  to  achieve  high  field
quality  near  the  transition  region.  Shaped  shims  are
designed  to 
the  degradation  of  beam  quality
(emittance growth).  This  approach is  closely related  to  a
previous  septum  magnet  design  with  two  oppositely
oriented dipole field regions presented by  the  authors [1].
Simulations  are  performed  to  obtain  the  magnetic  field
profile  in  both  designs.  A  PIC  simulation  is  used  to
transport  a  beam  slice  consisting  of  several  thousand
particles through the magnet to estimate emittance growth
in the magnet due to field non-uniformity.

1  INTRODUCTION

  A  linear  induction  accelerator  based  X-ray  technology
can provide time-resolved, 3-D radiography capabilities for
a hydrodynamic event. A kicker system,  which includes a
stripline  dipole kicker and a dipole  septum  magnet,  is  a
key component of this technology  [2].  The kicker system
cleaves a series of intense electron beam micropulses,  and
steers  the  beam  into  separate  beam  transport  lines  to
achieve multiple lines of sight on  target.  The first  part of
this  fast kicker system  is  a  high  current  stripline  dipole
kicker that  is  only  capable of  imparting  a  small  angular
bend to  the  beam  centroid.  This  is  followed  by  a  static
field  dipole  septum  magnet  that  increases  the  angular
separation of  the  centroids  and  steers  them  into  separate
transport lines.

  The ideal "box" geometry of  the  septum  magnet for our
application is  shown  in  Figure  1.  There are two  adjacent
apertures where ideally one aperture has  a uniform  dipole
magnetic field and the other zero field, separated by  a thin
septum  in  the  field  transition  region.  The  two  beams

emerging  from  the  kicker  are  incident  on  the  magnet  a
radial  distance  d   from  the  centerline  and  are  further
separated from each other by the dipole field as  the  beams
traverse  the  axial  length    l   of  the  magnet.  Given  the
beam energy, and the  incident  and  exiting  angles  of  the
beam  at  the  dipole  septum  magnet,  the  magnetic  field
needed  to  provide  the  desired  bend  can  be  calculated.
Assuming that  the  effect of  the  fringe field is  negligible,
the required dipole magnetic field  B is related to the  beam
energy  Eb   and  the  incident  and  exiting  beam  angles  θ
and θ

  The first design considered is a true septum  magnet with
a thin  layer  of  coils  and  materials  separating  the  dipole

During  the  beam  switching  process, 

intense
electron  beam  will  spray  across  this  material  septum
leading  to  particle  loss  and  concerns  on  beam  control,
vacuum quality, radiation damage, etc.   Therefore, another
configuration  without  a  material  septum 
is  also  
considered. The schematic of  the  second design is  shown
in Figure 3. It essentially consists of two  "C"  type  dipole
magnets  brought  into  close  radial  proximity.  With  this
configuration  it  is  more  difficult  to  achieve  high  field
quality near the field transition region. The rapidity of  the
transition  between the  dipole field  and  null  field  regions
depends critically on  h d/
, the ratio of magnet half-gap  h
relative to the incident centroid displacement  d .  The ratio
d rb/
,  where  rb   is  the  beam  radius,  must  also  be
sufficiently large so that the  incident beam does not  enter
the field transition region.  Achievable d is  limited by  the
fast  kicker  technology  and  the  maximum  fast  kicker  to
septum  magnet drift distance. Thus  we need  h   to  be  as
small as possible in order to obtain good field quality near
the  field transition  region.  However,  h   has  to  be  large
enough  to  allow  beam  transport  through  the  magnet
aperture  with  negligible  scraping  over  the  full  range  of
machine operating parameters. To  enhance  field  linearity
and  limit  the  degradation  of  beam  quality  (emittance
growth),  shims  are  designed  and  utilized  near  the  field
transition region.

3  MAGNETIC  FIELD  SIMULATIONS
The magnetic  field  in  the  dipole  septum  magnet  was
simulated  using  the  2-D  magnetostatic  Poisson  code.
Only  the  upper  half  of  the  symmetric  structure  was
simulated. Effects due to  the  iron  saturation over the  full
possible  range of  coil  excitation are negligible.  Figure  4
displays the  field contours for the  dipole  septum  magnet
which has  a thin  layer of  coils  in  the  middle. There is  a

high quality dipole field on the left side as indicated by the
straight field lines.

The vertical magnetic field on  the  midplane (y  = 0)  of
the magnet as a function of  x  is  plotted in  Figure  5.  The
predicted  magnetic  field  on  the  left  side  is  about  500
Gauss  as  expected.  The  magnetic  field  goes  from  the
maximum  to  a  small  value  when  crossing  the  center
septum  coil.  The electron beam entering  the  dipole  field
side  of  the  magnet  experiences  a  uniform  field  when  it
traverses  the  magnet.  The  simulation  result  also  shows
that there is a small  leakage field in  the  null  field region.
With  the  use  of  a thin  (3  mm) µ−metal  sheet  enclosure,
the  magnitude of  the  magnetic field leakage is  reduced to
less than 0.2 Gauss.

The simulated field contours for the  magnet without  a
material  septum  separating  the  dipole  field  region  from
the  null  field  region  is  shown  in  Figure  6.  The
semicircles  in  the  figure  illustrate  the  positions  of  the
incident  electron  beams  emerging  from  the  kicker.  The

curved field lines  near the  field  transition  region  indicate
non-uniform fields. With  this  configuration,  both  beams
experience non-uniform field which can lead to  emittance
growth. Compared to the magnet with  a material septum,
it  is  more difficult to  achieve high  field  quality  near  the
transition region with this design.

region.  This  emittance growth can  be  further  reduced  by
refining  the  design  of  the  shims.  These  simulations  do
not  take  into  account  the  non-ideal  effects  (vacuum
degradation, plasma,  etc.) resulting  from the  particle loss
on septum materials.

dipole septum magnet without a material septum.

To  enhance  field  linearity  near  the  transition  region,
shims of  trapezoidal shape are designed.   From  Figure  7,
note  that  the  field  lines  are  straighter  near  the  incident
beam position  in  the  dipole  field  region  because  of  the
shims. In addition, a µ−metal  sheet enclosure can also  be
utilized to reduce the leakage field in the  null  field region.
The effect of  the  shim  is  further  illustrated  in  Figure  8,
where the vertical magnetic field By on the  midplane (y=0)
of  the  septum  magnet  is  plotted.  The  solid  curve
represents the  magnetic field for the  case where  no  shim
nor µ−metal  sheet enclosure is  used.  It  takes  more  than
10  cm  for the  magnetic  field  to  go  from  the  maximum
value to  a  small  number.  The  leakage  field  in  the  null
field region is about  80  Gauss at  the  edge of  the  incident
beam.  With  the  use  of  the  µ−metal  sheet  enclosure
(dashed curve), the  field drops to  less  than  0.1  Gauss  at
that  location.  The  third  curve  represents  the  case  where
both  shims  and  a µ−metal  sheet  enclosure  are  utilized.
The  curve  shows  that  the  shim  reduces  the  undesirable
variation  in  field  at  the  beam  edge  and  centroid  for  the
beam  in  the  dipole  field  region,  allowing  the  electron
beam to experience a more uniform field when it  traverses
the magnet.

5  CONCLUSION

Two designs of  a dipole septum  magnet for the  use  in
multi-axis advanced radiography are presented.  One design
avoids the use of a material septum.  To  improve the  field
quality near  the  transition  region  in  this  design,  shaped
shims are designed. Simulations are performed to  estimate
the emittance growth in the magnet for both designs.

The authors wish  to  thank  G.  Caporaso,  Y.-J.  Chen,

and G. Westenskow for helpful technical suggestions.

  To  determine  beam  quality  for  the  various  magnet
designs, a PIC code was utilized to examine the  emittance
growth  in  the  magnet  [3].  A  20  MeV  beam  slice  was
transported through the magnetic field region using the
2-D  field  map  for  the  structure.  The  results  show  that
there is no emittance growth when the  electron beams go
through  the  material  dipole  septum  magnet  with  a  thin
layer of  coils  separating the  dipole field  region  from  the
null  field  region.    For  the  design  with  no  material
septum,  there  is  no  emittance  growth  when  the  beam
traverses through  the  null  field region  and  6%  emittance

ABSTRACT:  Kohn-Sham 
formalism  of  Density 
Functional  Theory  is  modified  to  include  the  systems  with 
strong non-dynamic electron correlation. Unlike in extended 
KS  and  broken  symmetry  unrestricted  KS  formalisms, 
cases  of  both  singlet-triplet  and  aufbau  instabilities  are 
covered,  while  preserving  a  pure  spin-state.  The 
straightforward 
is  suggested,  which 
consists of placing spin constraints on complex unrestricted 
function.  Alternative  approximate 
Hartree-Fock  wave 
approach 
the  perfect  pairing 
implementation  with  the  natural  orbitals  of  unrestricted  KS 
method  and  square  roots  of  their  occupation  numbers  as 
configuration  weights  without  optimization,  followed  by  a 
posteriori  exchange-correlation  correction.  The  numerical 
results  of  this  approximation  for  the  barrier  to  the  internal 
rotation  in  ethylene  are  reported  to  be  in  close  agreement 
with experimental data. 

consists  of  using 

Density  Functional  Theory  (DFT)  is  becoming  a  widely  used 
tool  in  theoretical  chemistry.  Restricted  Kohn-Sham  (RKS) 
formalism of DFT,1 based on single Slater determinant description 
for  noninteracting  system,  is  implemented  nowadays  in  most 
standard  quantum  chemistry  packages.  For  many  molecular 
systems its results are close in accuracy to those of coupled cluster 
method at computational cost nearly equal to the one of Hartree-
Fock (HF) method. This accuracy, however, is less consistent for 
“difficult”  molecular  systems  which  require  several  determinants 
for  their  description  in  molecular  orbital  (MO)  theory.2  The 
present Communication is aimed to investigate this inconsistency. 
The  method  presently  known  as  RKS  was  first  introduced  by 
Slater  in  1951  as  a  simplification  to  the  HF  method.3  Two-
electron Fock matrix in HF formalism contains two distinct terms: 
Coulomb  <ij|¹/r|ij>,  originating  form  electron-electron  repulsion, 
and  exchange  <ij|¹/r|ji>,  which  arise  from  antisymmetric  form  of 
HF  wavefunction  (Slater  determinant).  While  Coulomb  term  has 
interaction  between 
classical 
electron density distributions on MOs >i|i<, exchange term has no 
classic  equivalent  and  may  be  interpreted  as  self-interaction  of 
transition densities >i|j< (differential overlap between two MOs). 
Slater suggested replacing the exchange term in HF equations (the 
most  computationally  expensive  part)  with  the  approximate 
expression  for  uniform  electron  gas,  which  nonlinearly  depends 
on  electron  density.  This  approach  was  formalized  in  1965  by 
Kohn and Sham,1 who showed that it is in principle exact, if one 
uses  exact  exchange-correlation  (XC)  potential  instead  of  Slater 
exchange.  This  XC  potential  is  defined  as  an  external  potential 
necessary  to  keep  the  total  electron  density  of  a  hypothetical 
system  consisting  of  non-interacting  electrons  equal  to  the  exact 
electron density of the real physical system.  

interpretation  of  electrostatic 

The  functional  form  of  this  XC  potential remains unknown to 
the  present  day.  However,  numerous  approximations  had  been 
suggested,4  the  remarkable  accuracy  of  KS  calculations  results 
from  this  long  quest  for  better  XC  functional.  One  may  classify 
these approximations into local (depending on electron density, or 
spin  density),  semilocal  (including  gradient  corrections),  and 
nonlocal (orbital dependent functionals). In this classification HF 
method is just one of non-local XC functionals, treating exchange 
exactly and completely neglecting electron correlation. 

First  and  the  most  obvious  reason  for  RKS  performance 
inconsistency  for  the  “difficult”  systems,  mentioned  above,  is 
imperfection of the approximate XC functionals. Second, and less 
known  reason  is  the  fact  that  KS  approach  is  no  longer  valid  if 
electron  density  is  not  v-representable,5  i.e.,  there  is  no  ground 
state single Slater determinant for a given XC potential. Examples 
of  such  densities  (obtained  from high level MO calculations and 
thus essentially exact) were found by Baerends in molecules CH2 
and  C2.6  To  include  these  important  cases,  Ullrich  and  Kohn 
developed  extended  KS  (EKS)  formalism,  which  describes  non-
interacting system by an ensemble (linear combination) of several 
determinants, which differ form one another with just one orbital. 
Equivalent  (and  more  convenient  for  practical implementations7) 
is the description which retains single determinant, but allows for 
partial occupation numbers of several degenerate orbitals. 

Preliminary  EKS  calculations  indicate  that  the  result  deviates 
from  RKS  only  in  the  close  vicinity  of  degeneracy,8  and  an 
approximate  XC  functional  makes  this  range  even  smaller.9 
Comparison  of  the  potential  curves  for  intramolecular  twist  in 
ethylene8 showed that EKS curve is closer to (incorrect) RKS one, 
but  unrestricted  KS  (UKS)  curve  is  closer  to  almost  exact  one, 
obtained  with  CAS.  The  reason  for  this  EKS  failure  is  that  it 
instabilities  (namely  aufbau 
addresses  only  one  kind  of 
instability) observed in calculations,10 and studied theoretically.11 
The aufbau instability is observed when the energy of the lowest 
unoccupied  MO  (LUMO)  is  less  then  that  of  highest  occupied 
MO  (HOMO).  The  attempt  to  replace  HOMO  with  LUMO  in 
single determinant description raises the energy of the former and 
lowers the energy of the latter, thus retaining aufbau instability. 
There  is  also  another  kind  of  instability  of  RKS  determinant, 
called  singlet-triplet  instability.  It  can  be  avoided  if  different 
spatial  orbitals  are  used  for  α  and  β  spin  subsystems  (spin 
polarized  or  broken  spin  symmetry  solution,  BS).  BS  UKS 
description  has  lower  total  energy,  but  predicts  unphysical  spin 
polarization  and  nonzero  spin  density  (ρα-ρβ)  for  closed  shell 
systems.  Advantages  and  disadvantages  of  UKS  vs.  RKS 
approaches  from  the  practical  standpoint  were  recently  reviewed 
by  Cremer.12  From  the  formal  theory  standpoint  BS  UKS  was 
addressed  by  Perdew,  Savin,  and  Burke13  in  a  rather  paradoxal 
manner. They postulated that UKS gives the correct total density, 
while the spin density is incorrect, and suggested considering on-
top pair electron density instead. 

For a long time BS UHF wavefunction was known not to be an 
eigenfunction  of  the  spin  operator  S2.  Its  value  (taken  as  a 
measure of spin contamination) is typically intermediate between 
correct  singlet  and  triplet  values  (or,  in  extreme  cases,  higher 
multiplets).  Geometry  optimization  with  BS  UHF  usually  results 
in a structure, intermediate between singlet and triplet. The reason 
for this and other disadvantages of BS description is easy to see in 
the  case  of  two-electron  open  shell  system,  where  the  electrons 
occupy  orthogonal  spatial  orbitals  i and a (HOMO and LUMO). 
Correct  singlet  wavefunction  of 
two 
determinants:  (|iαaβ>-|iβaα>)/√2,  while  triplet  can  be  described 
by  tree  wavefunctions  (degenerate  in  the  absence  of  external 
field):  (|iαaβ>+|iβaα>)/√2,  |iαaα>  and  |iβaβ>.  Thus,  the  single 
determinant of UHF |iαaβ> is an average between the singlet and 
the first one of triplet wavefunctions (50/50 spin contamination). 

this  system  requires 

In 

I  propose 

the  present  contribution 

to  avoid  spin 
contamination  in  UKS  by  adding  a  second  determinant,  where 
spatial  parts  of  α  and  β  sets  are  interchanged.  Such  two-
determinant UKS shall be called spin-balanced UKS (SB UKS). It 
is  easy  to  see  that  SB  UKS,  similar  to  EKS  description,  is 
equivalent  to  RKS  wherever  RKS  solution  is  stable.  This  is  not 
the  case  for  multiconfigurational  approaches,  derived  from  KS 
method  (like  CAS-DFT14  or  CI-DF15).  Unlike  EKS,  SB  UKS 
approach covers both aufbau and singlet-triplet instabilities, since 
removing the latter eliminate the former as well. Thus, SB UKS is 
more general than EKS. 

The  practical  implementation  of  SB  UKS  is  straightforward 
within  complex  UHF  formalism:16  single  determinant  built  on 
complex  orbitals  has  real  and  complex  parts  (and  thus,  is 
equivalent  to  the  two-determinant  wave  function).  Complex  KS 
orbitals  must  be  optimized  self-consistently  with  one  additional 
constraint:  imaginary  part  of  each  spatial  orbital  in  alpha  set  is 
equal to the real part of the spatial orbital from the beta set with 
the  same  quantum  number.  The  total  electron  density  of  such 
spin-coupled  two-determinant  wave  function  is  equivalent  to  the 
one  of  a  single  determinant,  but  spin  density  and  total  energy 
differ.  Thus,  Perdew,  Savin,  and  Burke’s  postulate13  becomes  a 
theorem and spin symmetry dilemma is resolved in a more elegant 
way.  One  may  speculate 
in  SB 
wavefunction  will  be  close  to  MOs  from  BS  solution  when  it 
exists and to MOs of restricted method when spin-polarization is 
negligible. But unlike BS, spin polarization of the SB orbitals will 
occur when two-determinant description is needed, not only when 
there is a low in energy triplet state. 

that  optimized  orbitals 

Similar  to  other  multiconfigurational  approaches  in  DFT,14,15 
double  counting  of  electronic  correlation  needs  to  be  addressed. 
In  order  to  do  that,  it  is  useful  to  separate  the  electronic 
correlation  into  two  parts:  dynamic  (short  range)  and  non-
dynamic  (long  range,  arising  from 
interactions  of  nearly-
degenerate states). Dynamic correlation in molecules is similar to 
the one in the free electron gas, and thus is well described by the 
correlation part of the XC functionals. Nondynamic correlation is 
simulated  by  the  exchange  part,  when  the  nonlocal  exact  HF 
exchange  is  replaced  with  an  approximate  local  functional.12 
Specifically, it is self interaction error (exchange interaction of the 
KS  orbital  with  itself)  that  helps  to  describe  the  non-dynamic 
correlation and contributes to the success of the RKS method. SB 
UKS  approach  explicitly  describes  both  exchange  and  dynamic 
correlation. The active space in SB UKS includes all the orbitals, 
which  eliminates  the  need  in  the  elaborate  separation  of  the 
electron  density  into  correlated  and  uncorrelated  parts.14  On  the 
other  hand,  minimalist  two-determinant  description  ensures  that 
no dynamic correlation is included explicitly. For this reason only 
the correlation part of XC functional needs to be included in SB 

UKS  calculations.  Similar  reasoning  was  applied  recently17  to 
correct  the  energy  of  mutideterminant  wavefunction  for  dynamic 
correlation. 

The  existing  implementations  of  complex  UHF  are  not  well 
suited  to  impose  SB  constraint.  For  this  reason  in  the  present 
contribution  the  implementation  of  the  perfect  pairing  (PP) 
scheme18 (equivalent to complex UHF) was used. To demonstrate 
their  equivalence,  one  may  use  natural  orbitals  (NOs)  of  UHF 
approach. NOs are eigenvectors of the total density matrix. They 
come in pairs φ, ψ with occupation numbers of λ2 and 2-λ2 (λ=1 
for open-shell orbitals, and fractional otherwise). In the following 
example of twisted ethylene only one pair of fractionally occupied 
NOs  is  found.  The  rest  is  (nearly)  doubly  occupied  and  form 
inactive core ΦD. Detailed analysis shows19 that BS UHF orbitals 
χα,  χβ  can  be  expressed  using  NOs:  χα=µφ+λψ  and  χβ=µφ-λψ, 
where 2µ2=1+S and 2λ2=1-S, and S=<χα|χβ>. Typically overlap S 
is large, so that the spin-polarization parameter λ is small and µ is 
close  to  unity.  In  BS  UHF  description  the  wavefunction  is 
Ψ=|ΦDχααχββ>=µ2|ΦDφαφβ>-λ2|ΦDψαψβ>+√2|ΦDφψ(αβ+βα)>, 
where  the  last  term  represents  the  triplet  component  (spin 
contamination).  In  SB  description  above,  the  wavefunction  is 
Ψ=(|ΦDχααχββ>-|ΦDχαβχβα>)/√2=µ2|ΦDφαφβ>-λ2|ΦDψαψβ>, 
thus 
spin contamination is cancelled, but NOs and occupation numbers 
µ2 and λ2 remain the same. This description is readily generalized 
for arbitrary number of fractionally occupied NOs. Wavefunction 
of  this  exact  form  is  used  in  PP  method,  except  that  CI 
coefficients (µ/√2 and λ/√2) and NOs (φ and ψ), are optimized.  

Here I report the results on internal rotation barrier in ethylene. 
In all the calculations Gaussian 98 suite of programs20 was used. 
The  BS  unrestricted  solution  was  obtained,  NOs  and  occupation 
numbers were used in PP calculation unchanged (denoted PPNO 
in  the  following).21  For  the  sake  of  comparison  with  Ref.8,  the 
same  molecular  geometry,  basis  set  (4-31G)  and  XC  functional 
(SVWN5) were used. 

The  rotation  barrier  heights  are  compared  with  EKS8  and 
experimental22  results  in  Table  1.  The  restricted  approach  (RHF 
and  RKS)  does  not  work  well.  EKS  approach  leads  to  only 
marginal  improvement.  Unrestricted  approach  (UHF  and  UKS) 
works  better  at  the  expense  of  spin  contamination.  PP  approach 
using UHF results (PPNO-UHF) describes pure singlet, and gives 
the  barrier  value  close  to  CAS.  PP  approach  using  BS  UKS 
(HF+VWN5)  orbitals  underestimates  the  barrier.  After  the 
correlation correction (defined as the difference between UKS and 
UHF  energies,  evaluated  with  UKS  orbitals)  is  added,  the  result 
gives the best agreement with the experiment.

approach  holds  a  promise  to  be  the  final  word  in  half  a  century 
long quest for the exact DFT.

In  conclusion,  this  work  introduces  the  new  modification  of 
DFT  method,  SB  UKS.  It  addresses  both  singlet-triplet  and 
aufbau  instabilities  of  restricted  single  determinant  description. 
The new method can be implemented using constrained complex 
UKS  orbitals.  Alternatively,  a  close  approximation  can  be  used 
where broken symmetry UKS solution exists. It employs existing 
perfect  pairing  scheme,  but  NOs  and  their  occupations  are taken 
from UKS results instead of variational procedure. The results of 
this approximation are reported for the barrier to internal rotation 
in  ethylene.  They  are  found  to  be  in  a  close  agreement  with 
experiment.

Abstract 

The  sputtering  of  inside  wall  components  of  tokamaks  can  lead  to  the  injection  of 

supersaturated  vapour  in  the  edge  plasmas.  The  resulting  condensation  favours  the 

formation  of  clusters  which  can  give  rise  to  solid  particulates  by  further  accretion. 

Sputtering discharges are proposed to have highlight on the formation of carbonaceous 

dust observed in the tokamaks with graphite based wall components. The flux of the 

sputtered carbon atoms is evaluated in the conditions of our laboratory discharges as 

well as the evolution of their energy distribution. It is shown that a cooling mechanism 

occurs  through  collisions  with  the  discharge  argon  atoms,  leading  to  a  nucleation 

phase. A comparison between the carbon structure of the resulting dust particles and a 

dust  sample  collected  in  the  Tore  Supra  tokamak  is  proposed.  The  structural 

differences are discussed and can be correlated to specific plasma conditions.

1. Introduction 

 

    In  the  tokamaks,  plasma  facing  wall  components  (PFCs)  are  exposed  to  high 

particle  fluxes  which  can  induce  high  sputtering  erosion.  Off  normal  events  like 

disruptions, arcing, instabilities can furthermore produce melting and/or evaporation of 

these  PFCs  [1].  Additional  chemical  erosion  of  the  components  in  graphite  based 

material releases hydrocarbon gases as methane, ethylene, acetylene [2]. A portion of 

the physical and chemical eroded material generates dust with a wide range of size and 

shape. In the micro-millimeter size range and more, one can observe small pieces and 

fragments coming from the walls [3], irregular grains coming from brittle redeposited 

layers,  flat  flakes  from  thin  coatings  and  fibrous  particles  [3-6].  In  the  micro-

nanometer  scale,  spherical  primary  particulates  (PPs)  are  observed,  piled  up  in 

macroscopic  agglomerates  in  which  the  presence  of  nanotubes  has  also  being 

evidenced  [3].  The  PPs  can  aggregate  to  form  chains  of  particles  and  dense 

spheroids[7] as this occurs in plasma processing [8,9]. These PPs result either from the 

condensation of the vaporised material or from the multiple collisions between atoms 

and molecules released by the PFCs. In particular, radicals coming from hydrocarbon 

gases can polymerise to form macro-molecular precursors [10].  

    The ITER program has initiated different studies on the dust formation mechanisms, 

the  produced  quantities  and  their  effects  in  fusion  devices  [11,12].  Among  the  used 

wall  materials,  the  graphite  has  the  largest  capability  to  retain  tritium.  Carbonaceous 

dust is then considered as a safety hazard in the case of accidental device opening and 

a potential limit of the performances.   

     The  results  presented  in  this  paper  concern  the  carbonaceous  particle  formation 

from supersaturated carbon vapours coming from cathode sputtering in argon parallel 

electrode  glow  discharges.  Conditions  of  supersaturation  can  be  developped  in 

tokamak  plasma  edge  when  arcs  take  place  or  when  ions  accelerated  in  sheaths, 

acquire energy higher than the sputtering threshold. In particular, this process is likely 

dominant  in  the  Tore  Supra  (TS)  tokamak  [13],  operating  since  2000  with  a  toroidal 

2

 

wall  component  made  in  carbon  fiber  composite  and  so  called:  Toroidal  Pumped 

Limiter (TPL).  

    The  laboratory  experimental  conditions  are  presented  in  Section  2.  In  Section  3,  a 

simple model is presented to estimate the carbon flux injected in these conditions from 

the cathode surface bombardment. Then, a numerical analysis showing the cooling of 

the  sputtered  atom  during  their  collisions  with  argon  atoms  is  proposed  since  it  is 

assumed 

that 

the  particulate  precursors  come  from  condensation.  A  better 

understanding  of  the  dust  formation  can  be  provided  by  a  correlation  between  the 

carbon  structure  in  the  atomic  scale  and  the  plasma  characteristics.  In  Section  4,  we 

propose structural analyses [9,14] of particles produced in our laboratory experiments 

and of a dust sample collected in January 2003 in a shadowed area of the TPL of TS, 

i.e. not directly exposed to high fluxes of the magnetized plasma. The differences are 

discussed in Section 5, according to specific conditions and plasma parameters of each 

2. Experimental set up of  sputtering discharges 

    Argon DC glow discharges are produced between two parallel electrodes separated 

by 5 cm. The lower one of 10 cm diameter is made in polycrystalline graphite and used 

as cathode. The upper one of 12 cm diameter, made of stainless steel, is grounded and 

used as anode. They are set in a cylindrical stainless steel vessel of 40 cm long and 30 

cm  diameter,  equipped  with  four  windows  for  optical  diagnostics.  Argon  is  admitted 

through a wall inlet and pumped at the bottom of the device by an oil diffusion pump, 
connected  with  a  rotary  pump.  The  residual  pressure  is  lower  than  10-6  mbar  after 

several  discharges.  The  experiments  are  performed  at  the  argon  pressure  PAr  ~  0.6 

mbar,  without  pumping  flow.  Rather  low  discharge  currents  of  I0  ~  70  mA are used, 

resulting in discharge voltages of VK ~ -600 V and providing current densities of ~ 9 

A/m².  These  conditions  allow  carbon  injection  in  the  plasmas  through  cathode 

sputtering by ions and charge exchange (CX) neutrals.  

case.

    The stability of the discharges is controlled through the spectral line evolution of C2 

dimer,  one  of  the  molecular  precursors  of  solid  particles,  formed  here.  In  our 

conditions, the intensity of the C2 Swan band head (516.5 nm) remains constant during 

~ 20 min. We therefore, perform successive discharges of 10 min, separated by several 

minutes  during  which  the  pumping  flow  is  restored.  The  mean  cathode  and  anode 

temperature measurements by thermocouples are 120°C and 60°C, respectively. As a 

consequence,  we  assume  that  a  gas  temperature  of  ~  100°C  is  reached  during  the 

discharges.  
     The presence of the atomic hydrogen line Ha  in the successive plasmas is assigned 

to  the  water  residual  pressure  and/or  to  the  wall  outgassing  during  the  discharges. 

Oxygen or other impurities have not been observed by optical emission spectroscopy.  

     Nano-scaled  particulates  are  collected  on  stainless  steel  foils,  placed  on  the 

grounded  anode  surface.  Their  shape,  size,  microstructure  and  chemical  composition 

are  analyzed  by  ex-situ  diagnostics:  Scanning  Electron  Microscopy  (SEM),  X-ray 

Absorption  Near  Edge  Spectroscopy  (XANES)  and  InfraRed  (IR)  absorption 

spectroscopy.   

3. Flux and energy distribution of sputtered carbon atoms 

3.1 Flux of sputtered carbon atoms  

       At the intermediate pressure of PAr = 0.6 mbar, several assumptions can be made: 

i) the ionization within the cathode sheath is negligible, ii) the sputtering comes from 

the bombardment of argon ions accelerated in the cathode sheath and of CX neutrals 

for  which  l CX  <  ds,  l CX  being  the  mean  free  path  of  the  charge  transfer  and  ds,  the 

cathode fall length. In such conditions, one can have a raw estimation of the energy of 

the  incident  particles  on  the  graphite  surface,  assuming  a  linear  electric  field  profile 

E(x), along the direction perpendicular to  the  surface, up  to the negative glow.  After  

integration and  if one take E(ds) = 0, the potential expression is given by: 

 

 

 

4

 

 

 

 

 

The energy that ions acquire between to CX collisions is then: 

V(x) = VK/ds²  x (2ds – x)  

 

Ei = eVK/ds² l CX (2ds – l CX)  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(1) 

(2) 

     In our conditions, the negative glow location can be estimated with a cathetometer, 

at about ds ~ 4 mm from the cathode. In the case of intermediate pressure and voltage, 

l CX  is  relatively  independent  of  the  incident  energy  and  is  about  l CX  ~  260  µm.  So 

that, (2) provides an ion energy of about 100 eV.  

     The carbon flux is given by:

where nn,i, un,i are the atom, ion density and velocity, respectively. g  is the sputtering 

yield of graphite by argon particles of 100 eV energy. It is of the order of 0.4 % [15]. 

According  to  the  ion  flux  continuity  across  the  sheath  and  to  the  fact  that  a  raw 

estimation of 16 charge transfers along ds leads to 16 times more rapid neutrals of 100 

eV than ions, the expression (3) can be rewritten as:

3.2 Energy distribution of  sputtered carbon atoms 

     Sputtering  is  a  physical  process  whereby  atoms  in  a  solid  target  are  ejected  when 

the  target  material  is  bombarded  by  energetic  ions  or  atoms.  This  process  is  largely 

driven  by  momentum  exchange  between  the  projectiles  and  the  target  atoms.  In 

Thompson’s model [16], the sputtering is the result of collision cascades induced in the 

material volume by incident particles of energy in the range of 100-1000 eV. In such a 

case, the energy distribution of the sputtered atoms, in the direction perpendicular to 

the surface, in vacuum is:

     In  the  presence  of  a  gas,  the  sputtered  atoms  lose  their  energy  through  collisions 

with the gas atoms. This energy loss EF is given by:

where E is the energy of the sputtered atoms at the target surface calculated with (5), 

TG is the gas temperature, Ef /Ei is the ratio of energies after and before collisions and n 

is the number of collisions occurring in the gas, over the distance d. n is given by:  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(7) 

 
n = s dPG / kBTG 

 
where PG is the gas pressure and s

, the cross section assuming hard sphere collisions.  

     The evolution of EF during collisions can be calculated [17] taking into account all 

the  possible  energies  of  the  gas  atoms.  kBTG  in  (6)  must  be  replaced  by  EG,  a  given 

energy  in  the  Maxwell  distribution  of  the  gas.  Thus,  for  each  EG,  the  energy  loss  is 

calculated  for  a  fixed  value  of  the  kinetic  energy  E,  in  Thompson  distribution  and 

weighted by the collision probability. This latter parameter is given by the product of 

F(E) by the Maxwell-Boltzman distribution at EG. In this way, EF is computed over all 

possible collision combinations.  

     Fig.  1(b)  shows  the  normalized  energy  distributions  of  the  sputtered  atoms 

calculated at d = 3 mm from the cathode for PAr = 0.6 mbar and two incident energies: 

100  eV  (full  line)  and  300  eV  (dotted  line).  The  maximum  is  now  shifted  towards 

lower values and the width of the distributions is reduced. The maximum is near 0.1 

eV and is relatively independent on the sputtering particle energy.  

     At  d  ~  6  mm  from  the  cathode,  the  EDF  becomes  Maxwellian,  indicating  a  total 

thermalisation  of  the  carbon  atoms  with  argon  (same  temperature  of  100°C).  As  a 

 

 

7

 

consequence  of  this  thermalisation,  a  supersaturated  carbon  vapor  may  exist  in  the 

plasma, favoring the nucleation process by condensation [18].  

 

4. Experimental results 

 
4.1 Dust sample examples 
 
 
   The  SEM  image  in  Fig.  2(a)  shows  an  example  of  two  kinds  of  carbonaceous 

particulates  produced  in  discharges  of  various  duration  and  collected  on  the  anode 

surface.  Small  PPs  of  20-30  nm  size,  likely  formed  by  condensation,  are  visible  all 

over  the  surface.  Bigger  particulates  are  also  present  with  a  cauliflower  like  texture 

observed  in  the  samples  we  have  analyzed  and  especially  evidenced  by  transmission 

electron  microscopy.  The  particulate  in  the  left  side  of  ~  250  nm  size  is  clearly 

composed  of  well  separated  radial  columns,  having  a  porous  texture.  The  two  other 

ones, in the right side of size ~ 180 nm are composed of very close columns, separated 

by  fissures.  This  peculiar  shape,  cauliflower  like  has  already  been  attributed  to  an 

accretion process [19,20] i.e. a growing phase by collection of neutral or ionic species. 

We assume here that the column deposition could develop on surface inhomogeneities 

of  the  PPs  and  be  amplified  by  a  reduced  surface  mobility  and  a  carbon  sticking 

coefficient  close  to  1  on  the  one  hand  and  by  shadowing  effects  on  the  deposition 

dynamics  process  [21],  on  the  other  hand.  The  limitation  of  the  surface  diffusion  is 

usually  assigned  to  low  kinetic  energy  of  the  incident  species,  characteristic  of  the 

intermediate and high pressure discharges. C-H bonds whose presence is revealed by 

our  structural  analysis  can  also  produce  diffusion  barriers.  In  addition,  the  very  low 

grain temperature similar to that of gas, in comparison to that of graphite melting one 

can contribute to the formation of an irregular texture [22].  

     The  shape  and  size  of  dust  sucked  up  by  a  commercial  vacuum  cleaner  on  a 

shadowed area of the TPL of TS have also been analyzed. SEM investigations in the 

size  range  of  0.05-200  µm  show  essentially  the  presence  of  flakes  coming  from  non 

adherent  deposited  thin  layers.  In  the  majority  of  the  cases,  they  are  formed  by 

8

 

columns of inhomogeneous spatial distribution. An example is given in Fig. 2(b). The 

proposed  magnification  shows  columnar  depositions,  separated  by  deep  and 

sometimes, broad fissures, forming bunches of various sizes and various shapes. It is 

assumed here that the carbon deposition comes essentially from the sputtering of TPL. 
Indeed,  during  operation,  this  PFCs  is  sputtered  by  energetic  D+  ions.  Being 

accelerated in the TPL sheath, they gain energy of about 500 eV (sputtering yield of ~ 

2%) leading to the injection of carbon impurities in the plasma edge. Carbon return to 
the TPL in the form of C5+, for instance, produces self sputtering [15] at a yield of ~ 

20%. 

 

 

4.2. Dust carbon structure 

     The  atomic  arrangement  of  deposited  layers  on  substrates  and  on  the  surface  of 

particulates  formed  in  gas  phase  depends  on  the  plasma  parameters  and  on  the 

discharge  geometry.  Generally  speaking,  when  carbon  is  deposited  by  plasma 

processing,  a  great  variety  of  crystalline  and  disordered  structures  can  be  obtained 
because  of  the  multiple  orbital  combinations  of  the  carbon  element.  In  the  sp3 

hybridisation  for  instance,  the  carbon  atoms  have  four  valence  electrons  producing 
tetrahedral  s  bonding  (C-C)  as  in  diamond  and  in  alkane  molecules.  In  the  tri-

coordinated sp² hybridisation, three electrons produce three s  bonds in a plane and the 

fourth  produces  a  p  bond  (C=C),  perpendicular  to  the  plane.  This  hybridisation  is 

characteristic  of  the  graphite,  composed  of  parallel  planes  of  aromatic  rings  and  of 
alkene  molecules  like  ethylene.  A  mixture  of  sp²  an  sp3  hybridisations  provides  a 

disordered  structure,  the  so  called  amorphous  carbon  [23]  where  the  number  of 

aromatic  rings  can  dominate  (sp²  dominating).  When  hydrogen  is  incorporated,  an 
increase of the sp3 state occurs inducing structural defects. The identification of these 

carbon  hybridisations  has  been  driven  in  dust  examples  produced  in  our  sputtering 

discharges and in TS.

4.3.  X-ray absorption spectroscopy 

 
     The  chemical  bonds  and  the  surface  atomic  structure  (3-5  nm  depth)  of  dust 

synthesized  in  our  laboratory  conditions  (Lab.  sample)  and  collected  on  the  TPL 

surface  of  TS  (TPL  sample)  have  been  evidenced  by  X-ray  absorption  near  edge 

spectroscopy (XANES). With this diagnostic, the core electrons absorbing the incident 
X-ray,  probe  the  unoccupied  energy  bands  p *  and  s *, above  the  Fermi  level.  This 

investigation gives information on the crystalline or amorphous nature of the analysed 

samples.  The  experiments  have  been  performed  in  LURE  (Super  ACO  storage  ring, 

Orsay,  France)  on  the  SA72  beam  line  equipped  with  a  high-energy  toroidal  grating 

monochromator  providing  a  resolution  of  ~  300  meV  at  the  C-K  edge,  in  the  total 

electron yield detection mode.  

     A  comparison  of  XANES  spectra  is  proposed  in  Fig.  3(a).  In  the  TPL  sample 
  p *  transition  of  the  sp² 
spectrum  the  peak  at  285  eV  is  the  signature  of  the  C  1s  ﬁ

graphite  hybridisation.  The  spectral  structures  above  290  eV  result  from  excitonic 

resonance  (291.7  eV)  and  multiple  scattering  (MS)  resonances  within  the  carbon 

atoms, in the graphite structure. The peak at 288.5 eV could be assigned to C-H bonds 

likely due to the cyclohexane solvent used to stick the powder on the sample holder. 

This spectrum is therefore characteristic of randomly oriented graphite crystallites of a 

few nanometer length [24]. 
     The characteristic resonance of unconjugated sp² p *(C=C) bonds is observed in the 

Lab.  Sample  spectrum  at  284.7  eV,  slightly  shifted  to  lower  energies  compared  to 

graphite.  This  shift could be due to the incorporation of hydrogen and oxygen in the 

atomic structure. Indeed, the peaks at 286.3 eV and 288.2 eV are at the energy position 
of the p *(C=O) and s *(C-H) transitions, respectively and the shoulder around 289 eV 

is attributed to the s *(C-OH) transition [25]. However, optical emission spectroscopy 

measurements performed during the dust formation have not shown oxygen peaks. The 

presence of this impurity is therefore assigned to the sample air exposure, resulting in 

oxidation reactions and in carbon-water interactions that also produce C-H bonds. The 
Ha   peak  observation  in  the  plasma  emission  originating  either  from  the  residual 

10

 

pressure or from the wall outgassing also indicate that hydrogen is incorporated in the 

dust during its growth phase.  

     The  continuum  region  above  290  eV  is  made  of  two  broad  transitions  centered 
around 292 eV and 300 eV, assigned to the s * resonance of sp3 (C-C) and sp² (C=C) 

hybridisation, respectively. These spectral features show that the particulates formed in 
the  sputtering  discharges  are  made  of  sp3  tetra-coordinated  carbon  (C-C),  structural 

defects  due  to  C-H  bonds  and  dangling  bonds  which  make  the  particles  extremely 

reactive. They also contain sp² tri-coordinated atoms (C=C) that could result from C=C 

alkene and aromatic clusters of very short range (<1 nm) dispersed into the solid.   

     The  desorption  of  the  Lab.  Sample  impurities  has  been  obtained  by  annealing  at 

300,  450  and  700°C.  The  same  XANES  analysis  has  been  performed  on  the  sample 

after  each  thermal  treatment  without  air  exposure.  At  300°C,  the  impurity  peaks 

decrease  but  are  still  visible  as  shown  in  Fig.  3.(b)  in  comparison  with  the  origin 

spectrum (100°C). At 450°C, close to the TPL maximum average temperature reached 

before  January  2003,  the  desorption  is  achieved.  The  new  spectrum  shows  that  new 
carbon  arrangements  occur,  in  particular  with  an  increase  of  the  sp²  s *(C=C) 

resonance, around 300 eV. New aromatic rings are formed and the absence of MS fine 

structure  indicates  that  the  sample  is  amorphous.  The  overall  shape  is  now 

characteristic  of  an  amorphous  carbon  structure  in  which  the  size  of  the  formed 

aromatic ring groups is no more than 1 nm [24].  For higher temperature (700°C), no 

significant structural difference is observed compared to 450°C.  

     Fig.  3(c)  shows  that  the  new  carbon  structure  of  the  Lab.  Sample  does  not 

reproduce the one of TPL sample also annealed at 450°C. In this latter case, the peak at 

288.5 eV assigned to C-H bonds of the cyclohexane solvent has disappeared. Despite 

this  thermal  treatment,  the  TPL  sample  initial  structure  remains  and  this  suggests  a 

formation  temperature  higher  than  450°C,  in  good  agreement  with  a  structure  of 

randomly oriented graphite crystallites, deduced from the initial spectrum in Fig. 3(a).  

     The structural analysis has been completed by IR absorption spectroscopy.

4.4.  Infrared absorption spectroscopy 

      IR  absorption  spectroscopy  is  a  standard  analytical  tool  for  the  detection  of  C-H 
(C-D) bonds. This diagnostic provides the stretching (noted n)  and bending (noted d)  

vibrational  modes  of  the  analyzed  material  containing  molecules.  Spectra  were 

recorded  using  an  ATR  (Attenuated  Total  Reflexion)  spectrometer  (Nicolet,  Avatar 
370 FTIR) with a single reflexion and a resolution of 4 cm-1. Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 display 
IR  absorbance  spectra,  in  the  wavenumber  range  3600-700  cm-1.  They  have  been 

smoothed  and  are  presented  with  no  correction  of  neither  baseline,  nor  water  and 

carbon dioxide spectra. 

     The  TPL  sample  spectrum  is  shown  in  Fig.  4.  It  is  rather  flat,  the  noised  bands 
around 1520 and 1690 cm-1 being present in the baseline. The absorbance increase in 

the  right  side  is  assigned  to  the  dust  diffusion,  in  the  considered  wavenumber  range. 

The overall shape of this spectrum shows that there was no incorporation of impurities 

like  hydrogen  (deuterium)  during  the  growth  phase,  the  aromatic  cycles  being  not 

active by IR absorption spectroscopy.  

           Lab. sample spectra are shown in Fig. 5(a) and 5(b) before and after annealing 
at 450°C, respectively. The broad absorption band at ~ 3342 cm-1 in Fig. 5(a) is due to 

-O-H stretching vibration of H2O, trapped in the porous network of the cauliflower like 

dust, during air exposure. The reactivity with water is also observed with the bands at 
1276 and 1045 cm-1, due to the stretching mode n (C-OH). 
     The spectral band between 3000 cm-1 and 2850 cm-1 is the signature of sp3 aliphatic 
groups with the -CH3 asymmetric stretching vibration mode at 2951 cm-1 and the -CH2 
asymmetric  and  symmetric  modes  at  2924  cm-1  and  2855  cm-1,  respectively.  The 

corresponding -CH3 asymmetric and symmetric deformation vibrations are observed at 
1455 and 1380 cm-1, respectively.  

12

 

     The  band  at  1702  cm-1  comes  from  the  vibration  n (C=O), produced  by  oxidation 

after  the  device  opening.  An  intensity increase of all the above mentioned bands has 

been observed with the air exposure time, confirming the dust reactivity.  
     The most emergent band at 1600 cm-1 is due to in-plane, aromatic C=C symmetric 

stretching mode. Indeed, the sp² (C=C) ring vibrations become visible i.e. IR allowed 

when a high level of non-symmetric substitution occurs in the aromatic structure of an 
irregular  network.  The  corresponding  deformation  vibration  is  observed  at  910  cm-1, 

signature  of  anthracene  [26].  The  vibration  of  an  out-of-plane  aromatic  C-H  bending 
mode with one or two adjacent H, is observed  [27] at  867 cm-1. 

     The presence of alkene groups in the internal structure could be evidenced by the 
minor peak of the out of plane, bending vibration d  (C=C-H) at 982 cm-1 . 

            To  perform  IR  absorption  spectroscopy  after  annealing  at  450°C,  the  sample 

has been again air exposed during several hours producing the broad absorption band 
n (O-H) at ~ 3333 cm-1, in Fig. 5(b). The thermal treatment has strongly decreased the 
sp3  aliphatic  group.  In  particular,  the  -CH3  asymmetric  stretching  vibration  mode  at 
2951 cm-1 has disappeared and only remain the asymmetric and symmetric stretching 

vibrations of -CH2 group. 

      The carbon rearrangement is evidenced by the presence now of the aromatic C-H 
stretching mode around 3050 cm-1, characteristic of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. 
This can be correlated to new peaks at  886 cm-1 and 822 cm-1, corresponding to out-

of-plane  bending  modes  of  anthracene  and  of  pyrene  [28],  respectively.  The  bands 
centered at 1095 and 994 cm-1 could provide the corresponding in-plane, aromatic d (C-

H) bending vibration of pyrene and anthracene, respectively.  
     The  in-plane  aromatic  C=C  stretching  symmetric  mode,  around  1600  cm-1  is  still 

visible but slightly red shifted. 

     These  features  confirm  XANES  analysis  results:  the  particulates  formed  in  the 
sputtering discharges contain sp3 tetra-coordinated carbon (C-C and C-H) and dangling 

bonds  making  them  extremely  reactive.  They  also  contain  sp²  tri-coordinated  atoms 

(C=C) resulting on aromatic clusters and on alkene groups. Their annealing at 450°C 

leads to new carbon arrangement when impurities are released: new sp² tri-coordinated 

13

 

groups are generated in the form of pyrene and anthracene. The obtained new spectrum 

remains different from that of TPL sample. 

 

 

5. Discussion and conclusion 

    The differences in the shape and in the carbon structure of dust produced in TS and 

in sputtering discharges can be explained by differences in the plasma conditions that 

generate them and by differences in their transport, after their formation. In particular, 

TPL  dust  comes  from  a  surface:  1)  not  exposed  directly  to  the  plasma,  the  ion 
bombardment  producing  sp3  hybridisation,  2)  with  an  average  temperature  of  about 

250°C, the heating treatment producing sp² hybridisation. However, this temperature is 

too  low  to  explain  the  graphite  crystallites  they  contain,  well  evidenced  by  X-ray 

absorption  spectroscopy  and  by  Raman  spectroscopy  not  presented  here  [14].  This 

important result could show that the analyzed dust have been transported from hotter 

regions  and/or  because  of  their  bad  adherence,  they  can  have  been  heated  by  off 

normal events like disruptions [29]. Confirmation can be given by the fact that 1) their 

annealing  treatment  at  450°C  does  not  produce  structural  change  and  2)  they  do  not 
contain  deuterium  [30]  or  only  small  proportion  not  detected  by  the  proposed 

diagnostics. This later result could be of major importance for the deuterium inventory 

of Tore Supra. 
      The  sputtering  discharge  particulates  are  formed  by  sp3  tetra-coordinated  carbon 

(C-C and C-H) and dangling bonds. They also contain sp² tri-coordinated atoms (C=C) 

resulting  on  aromatic  clusters  and  on  alkene  groups.  These  features  of  amorphous 

carbon  are  characteristic  of  particles  that  have  grown  by  accretion  of  low  energy 

species  originating  from  a  combination  of  plasma  parameters.  On  the  one  hand, 

medium  gas  pressure  and  low  discharge  power  produce  low  carbonaceous  gas 

temperature  as  shown  in  Section  3.  A  reduced  mobility  of  the  carbon  species  on  the 

dust  surface  is  then  expected,  amplified  by  C-H  bonds,  producing  diffusion  barriers. 

On the other hand, Langmuir probe measurements show that the floating potential with 

respect  to  the  plasma  potential  is  about  -10  V.  This  value,  higher  than  the  graphite 

14

 

binding energy provides a range order of the energy that ions acquire in the dust sheath 

[31,32].  Therefore,  the  dust  surface  bombardment,  mainly  due  to  the  contribution  of 
Ar+  could  also  participate  to  the  formation  of  structural  defects  like  dangling  bonds. 

All these features may explain the atomic scale arrangement. As expected with such a 

structure,  external  thermal  treatments  show  that  the  released  impurities  lead  to  new 

carbon arrangements in the form of sp² hybridization, i.e. carbonisation occurs. 

    In the nanometer scale, a reduced surface mobility could also explain the observed 

columnar  deposition  on  surface  inhomogeneities  of  the  PPs.  These  inhomogeneities 

may be amplified by a carbon sticking coefficient close to 1 on the one hand and by 

shadowing  effects  on  the  deposition  dynamics  process  [21],  on  the  other  hand.  The 

cauliflower texture has not been changed by annealing in the temperature range chosen

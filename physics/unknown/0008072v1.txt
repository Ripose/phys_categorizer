NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN LINEAR COLLIDERS FINAL FOCUS

SYSTEMS

    Abstract

      The  length,  complexity  and  cost  of  the  present  Final
Focus designs for linear colliders grows very quickly with
the beam energy. In this letter, a novel final focus system
is  presented  and  compared  with  the  one  proposed  for
NLC [1]. This new design is simpler, shorter and cheaper,
with  comparable  bandwidth,  tolerances  and  tunability.
Moreover,  the  length  scales  slower  than  linearly  with
energy  allowing  for  a  more  flexible  design  which  is
applicable over a much larger energy range.

1 INTRODUCTION

    The  main  task  of  a  linear  collider  final  focus  system
(FFS) is to focus the beams to the small sizes required at
the interaction point (IP). To achieve this, the FFS forma
a large and almost parallel bem at the entrance of the final
doublet  (FD)  which  contains 
two  or  more  strong
quadrupole lenses. For the nominal energy, the beam size
where ε is the
at the IP is then determined by 
beam  emittance  and β*  is  the  betatron  function  at  the  IP
(typically about 0.1-1mm). However, for a beam with an
energy  spread  σE  (typicall  0.1-1%),  the  beam  size  is
diluted  by  the  chromaticity  of  these  strong  lenses.  The
chromaticity scales as L*/β*, where L* (typically 2-4 m) is
the distance from the IP to the FD, and thus the chromatic
dilution of the beam size σEL*/β* is very large. The design
of a FFS is therefore driven primarily by the necessity of
compensating the chromaticity of the FD.

In an “traditional” final focus system (SLC [1], FFTB [2]
or  the  new  linear  collider  designs)  the  chromaticity  is
compensated  in  dedicated  chromatic  correction  sections

and  high  beta  regions.  The  geometric  aberrations
generated  by  them  are  canceled  by  using  them  in  pairs
with  an  identity  transformation  between  them.  As  an
example, the “traditional” design of the NLC Final Focus
[3] with
is shown
in  Fig.1.  The  advantage  of  the  traditional  FFS  is  its
separated  optics  with  strictly  defined  functions  and
straightforward  cancellation  of  geometrical  aberrations.
This makes such a system relatively simple for design and
analysis.
The  major  disadvantage  of  the  “traditional”  final  focus
system  is  that  the  chromaticity  of  the  FD  is  not  locally
compensated.  As a direct consequence there are intrinsic
limitations  on  the  bandwidth  of  the  system  due  to  the
unavoidable  breakdown  of  the  proper  phase  relations
between the sextupoles and the FD for different energies.
This  precludes  the  perfect  cancellation  of  the  chromatic
aberrations. Moreover, the system is very sensitive to any
disturbance of the beam energy in between the sources of
chromaticity,  whether  due  to  longitudinal  wake-fields  or
synchrotron  radiation.  In  particular,  the  bends  in  the
system  have  to  be  long  and  weak  to  minimize  the
additional energy spread generated. In addition, the phase
slippage of the off-momentum particles drastically limits
the dynamic aperture of the  system. Therefore  very  long
and problematic collimation sections are required in order
to  eliminate  these  particles  that  would  otherwise  hit  the
FD and/or generate background in the detector.
The  collimation  section  optics  itself  also  becomes  a
source of aberrations since very large beta and dispersion
functions are required.
As a result of all these limitations, the length of the beam
delivery  system  becomes  a  significant  fraction  of  the
length  of  the  entire  accelerator,  and  scaling  to  higher
energies is difficult.

2 “IDEAL” FINAL FOCUS SYSTEM

   Taking into account the disadvantages of the traditional
approach, one can formulate the requirements for a more
“ideal” final focus:
1)  The  chromaticity  should  be  corrected  as  locally  as

possible.

2)  The number of bends should be minimized.
3)  The  dynamic 

the
preservation of the linear optics should be as large as
possible.

aperture  or, 

equivalently, 

4)  The system should be as simple as possible.
5)  The system should be optimized for flat beams.
It is straightforward, starting from the IP, to build such a
system:
1)  A Final Doublet is required to provide focusing.

2)  The  FD  generates  chromaticity,  so  two  sextupoles
interleaved  with  these  quadrupoles  and  a  bend
upstream  to  generate  dispersion  across  the  FD  will
locally cancel the chromaticity.

3)  The sexupoles generate geometric aberrations, so two
more sextupoles in phase with them and upstream of
the bend are required.
In  general  four  more  quadrupoles  are  needed
upstream  to  match  the  incoming  beta  function  (see
the schematic in Fig.2).

4) 

 

Figure 2: Optical layout of the new final focus.

The  second  order  geometric  aberrations  are  cancelled
when  the  x  and  y-pairs  of  sextupoles  are  separated  by
transfer matrices MF and MD:

ϕ12  and  ϕ34  are  the  elements  of  the  transfer  matrix
between SF1 and SD1.
The  beam  spot  sizes  dilutions  from  U3444  and  U1222  are
small  if  the  last  quadrupole  is  defocusing  and  given  the
typical flat beam parameters like in Tab.1.U1244 and U3224
can  be  made  to  vanish  by  properly  chosing  the  transfer
matrices between the sextupoles. Similar constraints hold
for  third  order  chromo-geometric  aberrations.  All  these
constraints  can  be  satisfied  with  the  simple  system
described above. A system with the same demagnification
as  the  NLC  FF  and  comparable  optical  performance  can
be built in a length of about 300m.

3 BANDWIDTH

The  new  FF  system  has  potentially  much  better
performance  than  the  traditional  design.  The  “minimal”
optics  concept  can  be  further  improved  by  adding  more
elements  to  minimize  residual  aberrations.  An  additional
bend  upstream  of  the  second  sextupole  pair  decreases
chromaticity through the system.  An additional sextupole
upstream  and  in  phase  with  the  last  one  further  reduces
third  order  aberrations  in  x-plane.  Such  system  has
vanishing aberrations up to third order, the residual higher
order  aberrations  can  be  further  minimized  by  using
decapoles.  In  particular  the  fourth  order  aberrations
generated  by  the  interleaved  horizontal  and  vertical
sextupoles can be reduced with a decapole placed near the
closest quadrupole to the IP. The new optics is shown in
Fig.3. The flat beam  parameters  are  given  in  Tab.1. The
new system has an L*=4.3m, which is more than twice the
original  value.  This  allows  the  use  of  large  bore
superconducting quadrupoles and simplifies the design of
the detector. Although the chromaticity is doubled due to
the larger L*, the performance of the system is still better
than for the original NLC FF design.

vertical pair.

Figs. 4a/b compare the bandwidth of the NLC FF and the
new design in the IP phase. Figs.5 show the bandwidth in
the  FD  phase.  The  bandwidth  is  derived  from  the
variation of the beta function and the beam sizes as they
actually contribute to luminosity, which is determined by
tracking.  The  beam  size  bandwidth  is  narrower  than  the
beta  function  bandwidth  because  of  higher  order  cross-
plane  chromatic  aberrations.  While  the  IP  bandwidth  for
these  two  systems  is  comparable,  the  FD  bandwidth  is
much wider for the new FF.

4 BACKGROUND

    The  chromatic  aberrations  as  one  of  the  main  sources
of  the  background  in  the  detector  have  been  extensively
investigated  in  SLC.  As  an  example,  Fig.7  shows  the
background in the SLD drift chamber as a function of the

The new FF one is much smaller and goes through much
fewer  optical  elements  and  much  shorter  distance.  This
greatly  benefits  the  chromatic  properties  of  the  new
system and more than compensate for the disadvantage of

additional sextupoles were added to minimize it, reducing

the  chromatic  correction  section.  It  has  been  observed
both in the SLC-FFS and in FFTB that simply turning the
sextupoles off, eliminates most of the background and the
beam loss monitors signals in the whole beam line.
For  SLD-SLC  the  background  was  one  of  the  major
limiting  factors  in  achieving  high  luminosity.  For  future
colliders 
is  greatly  enhanced:  design
parameters  require  beam  currents  nearly  thirty  times
larger than in SLC at ten times the energy.
A rough estimate of the background could be made using
the following assumption:
    1)  The  background  is  mainly  determined  by  chromo-
geometric high order aberrations originated in the CCS’s
as observed in SLC, for a given aberration it should scale
roughly as:
)r
   
being n m p q and r determined by the order and phase of
the aberration, N is the beam charge
Assuming  similar  aberrations  than  SLC-FF,  the  smaller
beam  sizes  across  the  FD  than  what  SLC  had  and  the
increased  beam  current,  we  should  expect  about  3  times
more background than  in  SLC  for  a  given  relative  beam
collimation.
    2)  The  radiation  levels  generated  in  the  collimation
section  should  be  comparable  to  the  SLC  ones.  This
requirement  comes  simply  by  the  requirement  that  the
area  should  maintain  residual  radiation  levels  acceptable
for human intervention. The possible relative collimation
then  cannot  greatly  exceed  just  about  a  3⋅10-3  of  what
done at SLC.
From  1)  and  2)  the  expected  background  could  then  be
about  a  thousand  times  higher  than  in  SLC.  Clearly  this
requires  a  formidable  improvement  in  the  collimation
section  altogether  or  a  minimization  of  the  sources  of
background in the FFS.
The  new  FF  offers  a  possible  solution  to  this  problem.
Fig.10  shows  the  halo  particle  distribution  at  the  face  of
the final doublet for the traditional FF and for the new FF.
The  beam  is  very  distorted  in  the  traditional  FF,  very
similarly the SLC-FFS, while the nonlinear terms are still
negligible for the new FF.
The nonzero dispersion across the FD in the new system
has little affect on the dynamic aperture. In addition, the
design  aperture  of  the  NLC  final  doublet  is  about
ra=10mm while for the new FF with twice longer L* this
aperture  can  be  as  large  as  ra=40mm.  Therefore  the
collimation requirements  for the  new FF  may be relaxed
by a factor of at least one hundred in the IP phase, and by
a factor of at least 3 for the FD phase and energy without
increasing particle losses at the FD.
Due to the shorter length of the system, there would also
be  less  regeneration  of  the  beam  halo  in  the  final  focus
itself  from  beam-gas  scattering,  reducing  an  additional
source of background.
Given the fewer elements and less bends, it could also be
possible  to  build  the  system  with  a  larger  bore  aperture
everywhere  (40mm),  further  improving  the  beam  stay-
clear and the vacuum in the system.

traditional NLC FF and for the new FF. Particles of the
incoming beam are placed on a surface of an ellipsoid

times larger than the nominal beam sizes.

5 TOLERANCES AND TUNING

    The effects of magnet displacements on IP beam offsets
for  the  NLC-FF  and  the  new  FF  are  shown  in  Figs.9a/b
respectively. The two systems are relatively similar, most
of the contribution to the beam offset at the IP is caused
by the FD motion. Fig.10 show  the effect of a particular
model of ground motion on the vertical beam offset at the
IP for the two systems. The main contribution comes from
the FD and probably it could be much smaller in the new
FF  because  the  longer  L*,  thus  allowing  a  more  rigid
support for the magnets.

vertical (white bars) beam offset at the IP for every

magnet unitary displacement.

Figure 9b: New FF horizontal (black bars) and vertical

(white bars) beam offset at the IP for every magnet

unitary displacement.

The tuning of the new FFS is very much similar to the old
schemes.  The  main  first  order  aberrations  come  from
quadrupole and skew quadrupoles components  generated

.  In  this
is  assumed  in  [4],  then  the  scaling  is
case,  with the new  design,  the  FF  for  a  3  TeV  center  of
mass energy collider could be only about 500 m long.
The  beam  also  emits  synchrotron  radiation 
the
in 
quadrupoles, which becomes more of a problem at higher
energies. This can be reduced in the new design because
the  larger  bandwidth  allows  the  FD  quadrupoles  to  be
lengthened  to  minimize  the  synchrotron  radiation  they
generate. For the presented optics, the dependence of the
luminosity  on  beam  energy  is  shown  in  Fig.16.  If  the
beam  parameters  from  [4]  are  assumed,  this  FF  can
operate almost up to 5TeV center of mass energy.

by  sextupole  offsets  and  can  be  routinely  minimized  by
optimizing  spot  sizes  and  luminosity  by  “knobs”  built
with  sextupole  movers.  In  general  for  the  new  FF  the
luminosity dilutions in the horizontal plane are about 50%
worst, since the larger chromaticity required (eq. 1) in the
system,  however  the  dominant  dilutions  come  from  the
vertical  plane  and  those  are  better  mainly  due  to  the
simpler scheme with less elements. Higher order spurious
aberrations,  due  to  unavoidable  lattice  errors,  can  be
minimized  with  additional  magnets  placed  in  convenient
locations.

6 SCALING WITH EMITTANCE AND

ENERGY.

To  maintain  optimal  performance  of  the  system  with
larger  incoming  beam  emittances,  the  bend  field  must
increase  like  B0∝√ε.  The  increased  field  is  necessary  to
hold constant the contribution of high order aberrations to
the  IP  beam  size,  as  well  as  the  contribution  of  the  IP
angular dispersion η’IPσE to the beam divergence.
    The  dependence  of  the  luminosity  on  beam  energy  is
shown in Fig.11. A fixed length FFS has a wide range of
energies  where  it  could  operate,  especially  if  the  bend
field is rescaled.
    Scaling  to  higher  energies  is  very  favorable  with  the
new design. For a  wide range of  parameters,  the  IP  spot
size dilution is dominated by the energy spread created by
synchrotron radiation in the bends. This scales like:

7 CONCLUSION

    We have developed a new Final Focus system that has
better  properties  than  the  systems  so  far  considered  and
built.  It  is  much  shorter,  providing  a  significant  cost
reduction  for  the  collider.  The  system  has  similar
bandwidth  and  several  orders  of  magnitudes  larger
dynamic  aperture.  This  reduces  the  backgrounds  and
relaxes  the  design  of  the  collimation  section.  It  is  also
compatible with an L* which is twice as long as that in the
traditional  NLC  FF  design,  which  simplifies  engineering
of the Interaction Point area. Finally, its favorable scaling
with  beam  energy  makes  it  attractive  for  multi-TeV
colliders.  We  believe  that  further  improvements  of  the
performance of the system are possible.

Introduction 

Institutions are, in general, in permanent quest for excellence. But… in the case 
of universities, what is really excellence?  The word somehow expresses a diffuse idea, 
given its complexity but also the universality and scope of the involved subjects. How 
can one combine themes of humanities with those of natural sciences?   How can one 
equilibrate pure and applied studies? We will hardly find a singular parameter that can 
evaluate and express, in a credible form, subjects that are so complex. 

The evaluation of universities has been the theme of recurrent discussions. Some 
of these evaluations have been expressed in the form of rankings. University rankings 
have been frequent among American and Canadian universities, for example. In recent 
years, some initiatives have established world rankings. The visibility of such initiatives 
may  have  implications  on  policies  of  institutional  development.  “Rankings  serve  a 
variety of purposes, good and bad … and are also inevitable in the era of massification” 
(Altbach, 2006). 

 As there is not a singular parameter that expresses the university excellence, the 
rankings  have  been  based  on  a  number  of  parameters  that  focus  the  institutional 
performance in a variety of perspectives. The larger the number of parameters and the 
better they are selected, greater are the chances that the conclusions will have credibility. 
A  small  number  of  parameters  (would  6  be  reasonable?)  will  always  be  regarded  as 
problematic. In addition, when dealing with institutions of a large number of countries, 
uniformity becomes an issue (van Raan, 2005).  One faces the problem of heterogeneity 
of  criteria,  languages  and  cultures.  Even  more  problematic  may  be  the  form  of 
establishing weights for the distinct parameters. 

The choices of both, parameters and weights, may represent cultural, political or 
economic perspectives that could introduce non-universal values and, therefore, should 
be regarded with caution. 

 
 

 

Existing world university rankings 
 

In  recent  years,  three  rankings  of  world  universities  have  been  published.    We 
will  list,  here,  the  main  parameters  and  respective  weights  (in  parenthesis).  A  label 
from ”A” to “M” has been assigned to each parameter according to Table 3.   
 
- Shanghai  Jiao  Tong  University  ranking  -  SJTU. This ranking is established using 
six parameters and arbitrarily attributed weights. 

A - 

(20%) -  N&S. Number of articles published in Nature or Science; 

B - 

(20%) -  HiCi. Number of highly cited researchers in 21 broad subject categories; 

C - 

(10%) -  Size. Academic performance with respect to the size of the institution; 

D - 

(20%) -  Award. Number of staff of the institution winning Nobel Prize and Field 

E - 

(10%) -  Alumni. Number of alumni of the institution winning Nobel Prizes and 

Medals; 

Fields Medals; 

F - 

(20%) -  SCI. Articles in Science Citation Index-expanded, Social Science Citation 

Index, and Arts and Humanities Citation Index;

-  The  ranking  of  the  Times  Higher  Education  Supplement  -  THES  adopted  the 
following parameters and respective weights: 
 
G - 

(40%) -  Peer review – opinion of 2,375 research-active academics; 

H - 

(20%) -  Citation/faculty; 

I - 

(10%) -  Recruiter’s review – the opinion of employers; 

K - 

(20%) -  Faculty to student ratio; 

L - 

(5%) - 

International student score – percentage of foreign students; 

M -  (5%) - 

International faculty score – percentage of foreign staff. 

 
 
-  The  Webometrics  ranking  measures  the  presence  of  the  universities  in  the  web, 
considering parameters such as size of the sites, rich files and visibility.  
J -  Presence in the web. 

While the THES ranking is based on relative numbers such as indices, ratios etc, 
the SJTU mixes absolute numbers such as number of papers, scientists and prizes with 
relative  numbers  such  as  academic  performance  relative  to  size.  The  Webometrics 
ranking is established in terms of absolute numbers. It is important to notice that in one 
case we look at the relative performance, regardless of the size, while in the other case 
the size of the institution also impacts the ranking. In this case, larger institutions tend to 
be better ranked than smaller ones. 

The present study performs an evaluation with a larger number of parameters by 
combining  the  13  parameters  described  above.  The  main  goal  is  to  find  out  which 
parameters are more and less important for the assessment of the academic performance 
in the world universities. The focus is to discuss methodology and not to establish a new 
ranking. 

We  utilized  the  data  from  universities  considered  in  the  2005  versions  of  the 
three  rankings  mentioned  above:  SJTU,  THES  and  Webometrics.  We  found  a  total  of 
178 universities that are common among these three studies. The limiting factor of this 
set  is  the  reduced  number  of  universities  in  the  THES  survey  that  published  data  for 
only 200 universities. 

The cross-correlation of parameters can be seen in Table 1. Parameters labeled 
from A to G are highly correlated among themselves (>0.50). Parameters K, L and M 
are  weakly  or  not  correlated  at  all  or  even  anti-correlated  with  other  parameters.  The 
parameters  from  A  to  G  are  usually  taken  as  canonical  indicators  of  academic 
performance.  It becomes apparent that three parameters (K, L and M), half of the ones 
considered by the THES, are indicators of aspects unrelated to academic performance.

Principal Component Analysis 
 
 

In  this  study  we  will  adopt  a  distinct  strategy  for  analyzing  the  question:  a 
multivariate analysis on the form of Principal Component Analysis (Murtag and Heck, 
1987). This strategy is more robust than the existing methodology of rankings for two 
reasons:  It does not establish weights a priori. In addition, we consider 13 parameters 
instead of only 6. This analysis calculates the principal components that maximize the 
explanation  of  the  variances.  If,  by  hypothesis,  the  first  principal  component  can  be 
associated  to  academic  performance,  then  the  correlation  of  the  parameters  (columns) 
with respect to this component will establish a relative scale of weights, not a priori but 
as  a  result.  The  correlation  of  the  objects  (universities)  will  establish  a  scale  of 
performance (ranking) of the universities. For those interested in more details, see  the 
technical note at the end of the paper. 
 
The Academic performance – Principal Component 1 
 
Principal Component 1 explains about half (47%) of the data variance (see Table 
 
2). It is strongly determined by the correlation among the columns A, B….J (see Table 
3). The top parameters in this correlation are the number of papers published in Nature 
and  Science  and  the  number  of  highly  cited  scientists.  Such  parameters  are  clearly 
associated to what one usually understands as academic performance of the institutions. 
This seems also to be confirmed by the correlation of the objects (universities) with the 
first  principal  component  (see  Appendix  A)  as  most  of  the  universities  best  placed  in 
this order are also well ranked in the various studies.  

Perhaps a surprise is to find that academic performance is not correlated with the 
internationalism of students (0.10) and faculty (-0.16). The later is even anti-correlated. 
The ratio faculty/ student is also only weekly correlated with academic performance. 
 
 
Internationalism – Principal Component 2 
 

Principal  Components  2  and  3  are,  by  construction,  not  correlated  with  each 
 
other    and  also  with  respect  to  the  principal  component  1;  they  are  responsible  for 
explaining  14%  and  8%  of  the  data  variance.  Principal  Component  2  is  dominated  by 
the internationalism of the universities as defined by the parameters L and M of Table 3. 
The correlation with the faculty score is 0.84 and with student score, 0.88. One of the 
relevant results of the present study is to show that the internationalism is not correlated 
with  the  academic  performance.  The  internationalism  is  weakly  correlated  with  peer 
review (0.23) and recruiter’s review (0.35) and weakly anti-correlated with the number 
of articles in the Science Citation Index (-0.28).  
 
Principal Component 2, the internationalism of the universities, points towards a 
geographic  discrimination.  Appendix  2  shows  the  10  first  and  the  10  last  institutions 
projected  on  this  eigenvector.  Among  the  top  ten  are  universities  from  UK  (4), 
Switzerland (3), Singapore (2) and France (1). Highly centered in Europe and/or small 
countries.  In  the  other  extreme  are  universities  from  large  countries  such  as  USA  (6) 
and Brazil (1) or countries that are geographically or politically isolated as Israel (1) and 
Taiwan (1).

It seems obvious that to cross the frontier from Germany to Switzerland or to go 
from Amsterdam to London is easier than to go from New York to California or from 
Recife to Porto Alegre. Why should the assessment of university academic performance 
be  affected  by  its  locations?  Principal  Component  2  may  perhaps  be  more  useful  for 
geopolitical studies than for university academic rankings.

here. The point is how to quantify it. Joint projects, interchange of faculty and students, 
learning  of  foreign  languages,  joint  publications  etc  are  of  great  importance  in  the 
promotion  of  excellence.  There  are  numerous  examples  on  how  careful  selection  of 
foreign  professors  has  played  a  strategic  role  and  positively  impacted  the  institutional 
development.  One form of quantifying the international cooperation could, perhaps, be 
the measurement of multinational co-authorship in publications. 
 
The faculty/student ratio – Principal Component 3  
 

Principal  Component  3  is  dominated  by  the  faculty/student  ratio  (0.89)  and 
weakly correlated with performance/size (0.21) and anti-correlated with peer review (-
0.33), recruiter’s review (-0.18) and presence in the web (-0.22).  
 
The extremes of the projections of universities with respect to eigenvector 3 are 
(see Appendix C): at the high faculty/student ratio, universities from France (5), US (3), 
Switzerland (1) and Denmark (1); at the low faculty/student ratio, are universities from 
Australia (5), Canada (2), Singapore (1), US (1) and UK (1). As mentioned above, this 
component is not correlated with academic performance but it could be relevant for the 
study of cost/benefits of the higher learning institutions. 
 
Public versus Private Universities: internationalism and faculty/student ratio 
 
 
The  international  faculty  and  student  score  as  defined  by  the  THES  considers 
that the more international members in the university, the better it should be ranked. Is 
this reasonable? In Figure 1 we display the degree of internationalism (PC-2) versus the 
academic performance (PC-1) only for US universities. We separate public universities 
from  private  (not-for-profit)  ones.  It  is  clear  that  they  have  distinct  behaviors.  Private 
universities  show  a  correlation  in  the  sense  that  institutions  with  better  academic 
performance  have  higher  degree  of  internationalism.  Public  universities  show  the 
opposite  behavior:  universities  with  higher  academic  performance  have 
less 
internationalism.  In  fact,  considering  only  the  institutions  ranked  better  then  40  in 
academic performance, one can see a clear separation of these two groups. Why is that 
so?  It  is  clear  that  private universities  look  for  student  from  everywhere,  as  long  they 
pay  their  (usually  high)  fees  and  tuition.  Public  universities  are  usually  subsidized  to 
some  level.  Why  should  they  subsidize  foreign  students?  The  dichotomy  of  these  two 
groups, clearly seen in Figure 1 is, therefore, easy to understand. The conclusion is that 
introducing  criteria  of  international  score  as  an  evaluation  parameter  discriminates 
unfavorably  public  universities.  If  this  is  a  relevant  conclusion  for  a  country  like  the 
United States, it might be even more relevant for developing countries.  
 
The faculty/student ratio is also correlated with the private versus public nature 
of the universities. For example, among the 10 US universities ranked highest in PC-3, 
9  are  private  and  1  is  public.  Among  the  10  lowest  ranked  institutions,  all  are  public. 
The conclusion is that using this parameter for evaluating academic performance, favors 
improperly  private  institutions.  As  the  US  News  ranking  also  uses  the  faculty/student 
ratio  as  an  evaluation  criterion,  it  is  not  a  surprise  that  it  ranks  20  out  of  the  first  21 
universities  as  private  institutions  (www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/ranking). 
Appendix A shows that among the 20 highest ranked US universities, 12 are private and 
8 are public – which shows much more equilibrated situation.

Academic Performance Rank (PC-1)

Figure  1  –  The  Internationalism  (PC-2)  versus  the  Academic  Performance  (PC-1)  for 
US universities. This displays distinct behaviors between public and private institutions. 
 
 
 
All  three  rankings  analyzed  in  this  study  present  some  flaws.  From  the  six 
parameters of the THES ranking, only three are correlated with academic performance. 
The  SJTU  ranking  also  is  based  on  six  parameters.  All  six  are  correlated  with  PC-1. 
However  five  of  them  are  absolute  parameters  and,  in  this  sense,  tend  to  favor  larger 
institutions. A second flaw is that the Nobel Prize seems to be overweighed. Although 
both staff and alumni achievements are well correlated with PC-1, the weight attributed 
to  them    (total  of  30%)  seems  out  of  proportion.  Finally  the  correlation  of  the 
Webometric ranking with PC-1 is meddling.   
 
 
 

Conclusions 

1.  A  multivariate  analysis  of  a  set  of  indicators  for  178  world  universities  shows 
that 70% of the data variance can be explained by three main components: the 
academic  performance  (Principal  Component  1  explains  48%  of  the  variance); 
the  degree  of  internationalism  (Principal  Component  2  explains  14%  of  the 
variance) and the faculty-to-student ratio (Principal Component 3 explains 8% of 
the variance). 

2.  As  it  is  usual  in  the  assessment  of  institutions,  the  academic  performance  is 
strongly correlated with publications, citations, awards and reviews – canonical 
indicators of excellence. 

3.  The  degree  of  internationalism  as  defined  by  the  THES  (this  should  not  be 
confused  with  international  cooperation  in  general)  is  not  correlated  with 
regions  have  different 
academic  performance.  Distinct  countries  and

performance  with  respect  to  the  internationalism,  depending  on  their  size, 
integration with other countries or political and geographical isolation. 

4.  The ratio faculty/student is only weakly correlated with academic performance. 
This  ratio  has  also  distinct  values  in  different  countries,  France  and  Australia 
being the two extremes.  

5.  The correlations of the parameters with the three main principal components are 

provided. 

6.  A  list  of  universities  ordered  according  to  Principal  Component  1  is  provided. 

This should not be regarded as a new ranking. 

7.  Internationalism  criteria  as  well  as  the  faculty/student  ratio  discriminate 

unfavorably public universities when compared to private ones. 

8.  The  conclusion  derived  in  the  present  study  may  be  relevant  for  institutional 
strategic  planning  or  for  the  formulation  of  public  policies.  The  quest  for 
identifying and implementing policies for supporting world class universities is 
associated to risks; some of them are identified in this work. 

 
Technical  note:  The  Principal  Component  Analysis-  PCA  -    is  a  multivariate  procedure  in 
which a set of correlated variables is transformed into a set of uncorrelated variables (called 
Principal Components) that are ordered by reducing variability (Murtag and Heck, 1987). The 
uncorrelated  variables  are  a  linear  combination  of  the  original  variables.  The  principal 
components  are  calculated  as  eigenvectors  which,  by  construction,  are  orthogonal  among 
themselves and, therefore, uncorrelated. The significance of each eigenvector is expressed as its 
eigenvalue.  The  first  Principal  Component  is  the  combination  of  variables  that  explains  the 
greatest  amount  of  variance.  The  main  use  of  the  PCA  is  to  reduce  the  dimensionality  of  the 
data set while retaining as much information as possible. It computes a compact and optimal 
description of the data set. 

 In  the  present  case,  the  projection  of  each  column  (parameter)  with  respect  to  each  
eigenvector is given in Table 3 for the first three  components. The rank of the universities is 
given  in  order  to  the  projection  of  each  object  with  respect  to  the  respective  eigenvector  (see 
Appendices).

A  general  classification  has  been 
established  for  guiding  systems  in  the 
field 
of  Computer-Aided  Surgery 
(CAS),  based  on  the  type  of  interaction 
(also called degree of passivity) between 
the human operator and the device [7]: 
• Passive systems: the surgeon is totally 
responsible  for  the  execution  of  the 
surgical action.  

•  The need for force control. 
•  The need for reaction to motions. 
•  The need to get very high position and

of the task.

In  this  paper,  a  surgical  guiding  system 
is 
based 
introduced,  and  evaluated  in  relation  to 
the  factors  listed  above.  This  system, 
called  the  Tongue  Display  Unit  (TDU) 
was initially introduced and evaluated in 
the  context  of  rehabilitation  studies  for 
blind people [1][2][5]. A small matrix of 
12  by  12  electrodes  is  put  in  contact 
with  the  tongue  surface,  and  a  signal  is 
sent 
in  order  to 
to  each  electrode 
stimulate the lingual mucous. 
In  this  context  of  sensory  substitution, 
the  interface  has  demonstrated  (1)  its 
conveying  meaningful 
capacity 

to 

highly 

already 

the  visual  nor 

information  to  the  user  and  (2)  the 
higher  discrimination  of  the  tongue  in 
spatial  acuity,  compared 
to  haptics 
interfaces  [5].  The  TDU  is  introduced 
here 
in  a  Computer-Aided  Surgery 
framework,  to  per-operatively guide  the 
surgeon gesture. 
With  the  use  of  per-operative  CAS 
systems,  the  surgeon  is  now  even  more 
confronted to problems of saturation by 
excessive  multi-modal  information.  The 
aim  of  this  work  is  to  send  back  the 
information  collected  by 
the  CAS 
system  through  one  channel  that  is 
neither 
the  auditory 
saturated 
channel, 
(patient,  screens,  videos,  conversations, 
etc.). 
As a first step, to validate the feasibility 
of  the  system,  the  information  supplied 
to  the  TDU  interface  is  the  real-time 
measured  position  of 
surgical 
instrument inside a volumetric model, in 
order  to  maintain  the  surgeon’s  gesture 
as  close  as  possible  to  a  pre-planned 
trajectory. This 3D rigid body is defined 
by  6  degrees  of  freedom  (DOF)  that 
and 
the 
correspond 
orientation  of  the  ancillary.  A  coding 
has  therefore  to  be  chosen  to  transform 
the  6D-measured  information  into  the 
2D surfacic TDU interface.

Introduction 
 
The prototype system architecture uses a 
graphical user interface (GUI) to control 
the  TDU 
the  optical 
interface  and 
localizer  Polaris  (Northern  Digital 
Inc.).  
The  idea  is  that  the  position  of  the 
ancillary  is  localized  by  the  Polaris  and

a 

compared  with  the  planned  trajectory. 
The measured difference between actual 
and planned trajectory is coded and sent 
to the TDU(Fig. 1):

calibrated (over the same axe) to track 
the  tool  in  a  3D  space  (Pt1,  Pt2),  by 
using the pivot’s method [4]. 
Preparation:  a  virtual  mod
el,  pre-
acquired  from  scanner  data,  is  built. 
The  surgeon  can  therefore  plan  the

direction; 
therefore  only 
the  GUI 
supplies the stimuli that correspond to 
the orientation of the tool (a direction 
parallel  to  the  trajectory  means  no 
stimuli). At the same time, to maintain 
the  tip  displacement  closer  enough  to 
the  trajectory,  a  conical  volume  is 
a  virtual 
representing 
specified, 
security  confined  zone.  This  virtual 
zone is coded onto the TDU interface 
by  the  mean  of  peripheral  stimulation 
when the tool orientation differs
 from 
the planned trajectory direction. 

In the example given in Fig. 3, the user 
has to establish the closer position to the 

to 

centre 

trajectory  entry  point  on  the  patient 
extend  skin  surface.  For  this,  the  actual 
position of the tip(Fig. 3a) is tracked by 
the Polaris, and sent to the TDU.  
A  bad  tip  position  is  represented  by  a 
square stimuli (formed by the activation 
of  four  electrodes)  with  a position  from 
error 
proportional 
the 
measured  from  tip  to  pre-planned  entry 
point.  A  good  tip  position  at  the  entry 
points means the activation of the TDU, 
in its central part (Fig. 3b).  
Then,  the  orientation  of  the  ancillary  is  
measured  and  compared  with  the  pre-
planned trajectory orientation. The error 
is  coded  by  the  activation  of  peripheral 
pins closer to the higher part of ancillary 
(Fig. 3c). In this example, a given corner 
is  active  and  the  user  has  to  avoid  this 
direction  to  keep  the  right  ancillary 
orientation (Fig. 3d).  
 
The  localizer  tracks  the  position  of  two

making therefore a curved trajectory.  
In  each  test,  the  errors  between  actu

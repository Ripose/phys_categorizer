Abstract

The variation with energy of the total cross section, σT(x), for elastic electron
scattering  from  atoms  of  several  elements  is  caused  primarily  by  shape

resonances  corresponding  to  the  formation  of  temporary  negative  ions.  It  is

shown  that  such  cross  sections  are  expressible  analytically  in  terms  of  a

constant background B, added to a function F(x) given by a “generalized Fano

profile” [Durand Ph, et al (2001) J. Phys. B: At. Mol. Opt. Phys. 34, 1953, ibid

(2002) 35, 469]. In three cases (sodium, magnesium and mercury), a detailed
consideration proves that the representation σT(x)=F(x)+B is accurate in a fairly
wide energy range. Moreover, the related momentum transfer cross sections,
written in the form σM(x)=aF(x)+B’, are tailor-made for studying “elastic” electron
transport in terms of the two-term solution of the Boltzmann equation: Not only

are  the  resulting  swarm  transport  coefficients  adjustable  to  the  experimental
values (with a≅1, B ’ < B ), but above all they are calculable very easily because
the  unnormalized  energy  distribution  is  obtainable  analytically.  The  ample

saving in computational effort is exploited in order to test the Wannier-Robson

“momentum-transfer  approximation”;  it  is  found  that,  in  these  cases  of

resonance-dominated cross sections, the latter method can be so accurate that
it  can  be  used  to  recover  σM(x) from experimental data algebraically.  In  the
margin,  a  model  profile  is  presented  that  gives  rise  to  negative  differential

conductivity.

1. Introduction

Unstable  compound  states  (negative  ion  shape  resonances)  can  be  formed

when an impacting low-energy electron is temporarily trapped in a neutral atom

by  a  combination  of  polarization  and  centrifugal  barrier  potentials.  The  alkali

metals, alkaline earths, and the group IB and IIB elements are particularly good

candidates  for  such  resonant  behavior.  As  a  result,  the  total  elastic  cross-
sections, σT, for the scattering of electrons by atoms of these elements display
large peaks at low energy. The asymmetric nature of the peaks suggests that

these  cross  sections  should  be  expressible  in  terms  of  the  well-known  Fano

lineshape for an isolated resonance in a “flat” continuum (decay channel) [1].

However,  a  comparison  with  experimental  cross  sections  shows  that  this  is

impossible:  interference  effects  caused  by  higher-lying  broad  resonances

imbedded  in  the  same  continuum  significantly  modify  the  single  resonance

Fano profile (a forceful example appears in section 6.1).

Lately,  a  simple  and  elegant  theory  has  been  presented  in  which  the

case  of  overlapping  resonances  is  treated  in  terms  of  “generalized  Fano

profiles”  F(x)  [2-3].  The  addition  of  a  constant  background  to  these  profiles

provides  analytic  expressions  for  the  elastic  cross  sections  of  group  I  and  II

elements that are quite precise in a wide energy range. This is the main theme

of the present paper.

The incentive for this undertaking stems from the long-standing need to

simplify  the  calculation  of  electron  transport  coefficients.  In  fact  this  work

evolved  in  the  course  of  an  effort  to  model  realistically  certain  transport

theoretical  phenomena  in  a  classic  variant  of  the  Franck-Hertz  experiment

where the low-energy shape resonance in mercury plays an important role, as

described in [4-5].

When inelastic collisions are inoperative, the energy distribution f(x) of

electrons traversing a gas is governed by the momentum-transfer cross section
σM(x). Of  course,  even  in  the  simplest  case  of  the  two-term  solution  of  the
Boltzmann  equation  in  the  swarm  approximation,  the  calculation  of  f(x)  is  an

unpleasant task because the cross section appears inside an indefinite integral.
It  was  noticed  that  if  σM(x) is given  by  a  conventional  or  a  generalized  Fano
profile,  this  integral  can  be  evaluated  in  closed  form,  and  hence  f(x)  and  the

resulting  transport  coefficients  are  obtainable  with  trifling  computational

discomfort.

Naturally, one is tempted to assume that the resonance profile of σM(x)
 is similar to the expression derived for σT(x) and inquire whether this form could
be used to reproduce known experimental results. It will be shown that this is

indeed accomplishable, with a different background B’ and some minor tuning
in the weight of F(x), namely: σM(x)=aF(x)+B’, a≅1.

On the way to obtaining a good fit to experimental data it is found that

some  earlier  determinations  of  momentum-transfer  cross  sections  (biased  as

they often are by theoretical calculations) are faulty, in fact too narrow. What is

lacking is the structure between the peak and the inelastic threshold caused by

the  overlap  of  the  broader  higher-lying  resonances.  This  broad  structure  is

precisely what the theory of generalized profiles is addressed with.

The result of  this analysis  is that there is a much wider range of E/N

(the ratio of electric field to gas number density) in which inelastic effects are

essentially  inoperative.  The  reason  is  that,  when  driven  through  a  gas  of

resonance-dominated  atoms,  a  spatially  homogeneous  swarm  acquires  the

character  of  a  beam  and  essentially  maintains  this  identity  as  the  field  rises,

until the energy of its centroid attains the inelastic threshold.

As an aside, the present results provide a convenient means for testing

the so-called “momentum-transfer approximation” initiated by Wannier [6] and

developed further later on, especially by Robson [7-9]. This scheme is mainly

useful  for  gaining  a  physical  understanding  of  transport  phenomena  and  is

exact for constant collision frequency. It is found that in the present case of real

gases with sharply peaked elastic cross sections the simple equations of that

method  can  be  very  accurate.  In  fact,  they  can  even  be  used  for  obtaining  a
remarkably good estimate of σM(x) from experimental data on the drift velocity,
without solving the Boltzmann equation.

The  presentation  is  organized  as  follows:  In  section  2  we  summarize

the  present  knowledge  on  low-energy  electron-atom  shape  resonances.  In

section 3 we briefly state the result of the theory of generalized Fano profiles

and explain how these expressions can be brought into harmony with elastic

cross sections of elements of section 2. In sections 4-6, we select three cases,

(Na, Mg, Hg, respectively) where sufficient information of resonance energies

and  widths  is  available,  and  construct  generalized  Fano  cross  sections

consistent  with  existing  experimental  and  theoretical  results.  For  sodium  and

mercury,  we  use  these  expressions  in  order  to  fit  measured  transport

coefficients  and  to  test  the  momentum-transfer  approximation.  Section  7

describes  a  special  kind  of  generalized  profile  leading  to  negative  differential

conductivity. A sharp multi-peaked profile similar to the theoretical low-energy

cross section of cesium is given in section 8. Section 9 highlights a shortcoming

of the method that is significant in the region of ultra-low energies.

2. Present knowledge on low-energy shape resonances

Work  on  low-energy  shape  resonances  carried  out  before  1994  has  been

reviewed in [10]. Some newer results will be referenced in this summary.

In the alkalis, the ground state of the negative ion (ns2 1S) is stable. The
first excited state (ns np  3P) is found to be an unresolved resonance in Li, Na,
and K, that gives rise in each case to a pronounced peak in the cross sections

at less than 0.12 eV. As to the heavier elements, a recent relativistic calculation

shows that in Rb the fine structure separation is still small but in Cs the splitting

is  sufficiently  larger  than  the  widths,  so  that  three  peaks  of  enormous  height
(18000-24000 a02) are displayed in the total cross section below 0.015 eV [11].
In Fr, the sharpness of structure is reduced as the widths increase.

Among the IB elements only Cu has been studied [12] and appears to
have a sharp (4s4p 3P) resonance at 0.3 eV and a broader (4s4p 1P) feature at
0.5 eV.

In  the  lighter  alkaline  earths  Be  and  Mg,  the  low-lying  peaks  are
attributed to the unresolved (ns2 np  2P) ground state of the negative ion that is
now unstable. They are followed by a broad hump due to the 2D state. In Ca,
the ground state is stable but the 2D resonance is narrower and gives rise to a
well-defined peak in σT(x) at about 1.1 eV. The result is that there is now a deep
Ramsauer  minimum  behind  the  peak  [13-14].  Analogous  results  hold  for  Sr.

Little is known about Ba and next to nothing on Ra.

The  group  IIB  elements  are  more  accessible  experimentally  because
the  peak  in  the  cross  section  produced  by  the  lowest-lying  (ns2 np  2P)

resonance occurs at several tenths of eV. As a result the existence of a “large

variation  in  the  mean  free  path”  at  about  0.5 eV in elastic electron scattering

from Cd and Hg was discovered as early as 80 years ago [15] in a medium-

pressure  transmission  experiment  of  the  type  discussed  in  [4].  The  currently

known  experimental  values  for  the  energies  of  the  peaks  are  0.49  eV  for  Zn

[16], 0.33 for Cd, [16,18] and 0.42 eV for Hg [17].

Theoretical  work  on  Zinc  and  Cadmium  is  scarce.  Values  for  the
unresolved  2P resonance energy of 0.23 and 0.31 eV have been obtained for
Zn, and of 0.28 and 0.18 eV for Cd [19,20]. Much more is known about mercury.

In this case there is substantial fine structure splitting of the doublet. Two peaks
at  energies  of  about  0.2  and  0.4  eV  have  been  found  for  the  2P1/ 2 and  2P 3/ 2
resonances  in  relativistic  calculations  but  only  a  single  peak  is  observed

experimentally [17]. This discordance is resolved in section 6 when the profile of

the peak is expressed in terms of overlapping resonances.

Low energy negative  ion  resonances  in  other  groups  have  also  been

predicted sporadically (C, N, Pb, Tl).

3. Generalized Fano Profiles

The  familiar  formula  due  to  Fano  [1]  for  the  asymmetric  profile  of  the  cross

section  in  the  presence  of  a  single  resonance  interacting  with  a  continuum

(decay channel) has the form

=
σ σ

ε
(

   (1)

Here σa  and σb   are the resonant and nonresonant portions of the cross
section, ε = 2 (x−x0 )/ Γ , with x0  the resonance energy and Γ its width, and q is a
parameter  called  the  index  of  asymmetry.  In  the  case  of  one  or  more  well-

isolated  resonances,  equation  (1)  can  be  used  to  obtain  q  and  hence  the
resonance parameters x0  and Γ from experimental profiles. In practice however,
the  complete  profile  is  often  the  result  of  interference  among  overlapping

resonances  and  the  simple  representation  of  the  profile  as  a  series  of  Fano

terms is lost [21-22].

Recently, a generalized expression of cross section profiles involving

two  or  more  interfering  resonances  was  derived  in  [2-3].  This  lineshape  is

simply  a  product  of  Fano factors and of a Breit-Wigner term representing the

portion of the continuum (lumped essentially into a broad “quasi-bound state”, a

wave packet) that is strongly coupled to the resonances. For two resonances, it

has the form

where εi= 2 (x−xi)/ Γi ,  as before, and σ0  is a constant. In this theory, the q’s are
not square roots of ratios of transition amplitudes as in the conventional Fano
formula. They are given in terms of the roots ei of a certain polynomial P(x) (of
degree n for n resonances and one continuum), by q i = ( 2 xi / Γi)-ei. For n=1 and 2,
the coefficients in P(x) are simple functions of the complex energies xi -iΓi/2  and
certain ”generalized” oscillator strengths. Such details are not required here but

the point is that the expression of the profile in terms of q’s is entirely a matter of

convenience. A crucial feature of the form (2) is that, unlike (1), it tends to zero

as x tends to infinity.

We will suppose that in the group I and II elements the cross section

between zero and the higher-lying set of (Feshbach) resonances and Wigner-

cusps associated with excited states can be written as

σ(x)=F(x)+B

(3)

where  F(x)  has  the  form  (2)  with  a  few  shape  resonances  and  one  effective

continuum,  and  B  is  a  phenomenological  quantity  representing  dynamics
involving  states  that  are  not  included  in  the  model  subspace  spanned  by  the

resonances,  on  which  F(x)  is  based.  We  will  also  assume  that  there  is  an
energy interval xmin< x< xmax in which B can be approximated by a constant. For
the sake of simplicity we will take xmin=0. In the cases considered here, F(0)≅0,
so that B≅σ(0); if xmax is sufficiently large, B is also close to σ(xmax). 

Equation (3) will be used in the following sections in order to construct

the elastic cross sections of Na, Mg and Hg. As we will see, these expressions
are  quite  accurate  in  a  region  xmin< x< xmax  where  xmax  can  approach  or  even
exceed the inelastic threshold and xmin is of the order of thermal energies. Below
xmin, they can be highly inaccurate (see section 9).

In building the profiles we proceed as follows. For our basic input we
take the zeros (say α and β, α > β) of the derivative of σ(x). These are quantities
that stand out in theoretical calculations and can be measured in an ideal beam

experiment.  In  the  absence  of  the  damping  factor  the  resonance  parameters

would be given by the simple expressions

  (4)

We  begin  by  varying  q  until  x1  and  Γ 1  are  close  to  the  best  known
values (a common property of these shape resonances is that x1≅ Γ1 and β≅ 0;
equations (4) then imply that q≅ 2). In the next step we insert these preliminary
values  in  the  full  expression  (3)  with  two  factors  in  F(x)  (one  q),  in  order  to

display  a  first  view  of  the  generalized  profile;  the  initial  trial  values  of  the
“continuum” parameters x2 and Γ2 are determined by an educated guess with an
eye  on  reproducing  the  observed  form  of  the  cross  section  between  the

resonance and the excitation threshold. Approximate values of the constants B
and σ0 are deduced from theoretical information on σT(0) and on the height of
the  peak.  In  the  end,  the  final  values  of  q,  x2 Γ 2, σ 0,  and  B,  are  sought  by
adjusting to existing experimental data on σT(x) without varying x1,  and Γ1. The
best fit might necessitate the inclusion of an additional asymmetric factor with a
second profile index q2.

Bare numbers for energy will refer to eV, for cross sections to squared

Bohr radii (a0

2) and for the ratio E/N to Td (1 Td=10 −17 V cm2).

4. Sodium

4.1. Derivation of the analytic cross section

It seems that there is only one reliable measurement of σT(x) for sodium, that of
Kasdan et al. [23]. Their results agree well with the theoretical calculations of

[24-26] and show that the older data of Brode [27] and Perel et al [28] are faulty.

The  recording  of  Johnston  and  Burrow  [17]  is  distorted  by  the  beam  energy

distribution and is thus unusable for our purposes.

A reasonable choice of input for sodium consistent with theory [25-26] and
experiment [17] is given by α between 0.10 and 0.12 and β = 0.01. For α = 0.108
the  value  q=1.73  gives  x1= 0.083 and Γ1= 0.085, very close to the parameters

found  in  [26]  for  the  (3s3p  3P)  resonance.  Starting  values  for  the  remaining
parameters can be obtained as follows: The computed cross sections of [25,26]
suggest  that  B ≅ 300  and  σ 0 ≅ 620  [since  σ0 ≅ (σmax–B)/(1+q2)  and  σ m a x ≅ 2800].
Further, one may suppose that the (3s3p  1P) state is a very broad resonance
that  is  unobservable  except  insofar  as  it  determines  the  parameters  of  the
damping factor. In this spirit one can start with x2=0.15 (as indicated by the early
behavior of the 1P phase shift in [26]), and Γ2 ≅1.

Our final generalized Fano cross section fitted to the experimental data of

[23] is shown in figure 1 (black curve). It is given by equation (3) with

         x1= 0.083, Γ1= 0.085, q=1.3, x2 = 0.11, Γ2 =1.5, σ0 =950, B = 300

  (5)

The ultimate value of α (the location of the peak) is 0.116, not far from our initial
input  and  very  close  to  the  theoretical  values  in  [24]  and  [25].  The  lowest
extremum β has moved to 0.03.

Although the peak itself is not included in the experimental points, their

agreement with our cross section is very satisfactory. Obviously in this case the

upper  limit  (xmax)  of  validity  of  the  approximation  “B=constant”  extends  well
beyond  the  inelastic  threshold  (2.1  for  Na).  It  should  be  stressed  that  the
damping factor is essential for molding the energy behavior of σ T(x) between
peak and threshold to the experimental curve, a point illustrated repeatedly in

the next sections.

4.2. Calculating transport coefficients

We now assume that, for practical purposes, the inherent difference between
σ M (x)   and  σT(x)  is  essentially  contained  in  the  background  term,  so  that
σM(x)=aF(x)+B’, with a ≅ 1, and use this expression to compute the drift velocity,
as a function of E/N, of an electron swarm in sodium vapor, in the range of E/N
where inelastic effects are negligible. The fact that σM(0)  differs from σT(0) is not
important since neither of these cross sections is expected to be accurate near

x=0 (see section 9).

In the standard two-term approximation, the isotropic component f0 (x)

of the electron energy distribution is given by

where  e  is  the  electron  charge,  k  is  the  Boltzmann  constant,  T  is  the

temperature of the neutral gas, E is the electric field, N is the number density of
atoms and M/m is the atom/electron mass ratio (205.52 for Na).

With  σ(x)  expressed  in  the  form  (3),  the  integral  in  equation  (7)  can
easily  be  evaluated  analytically,  regardless  of  the  number  of  factors  in  F(x).

Therefore only the normalization factor, c, needs to be calculated numerically
with (8) in order to obtain f0 (x) and hence the anisotropic component f1 (x) along
the axis of the field. As a result, the various transport coefficients as functions of

E/N are sequences of simple numerical integrals, computable in seconds. Our
concern will be with the drift velocity w

Strictly  speaking,  the  upper  limit  of  integration  in  equations  (8-10)
should be consistent with the limit of validity, xmax, of our expression for σM(x).
Fortunately, with the cross sections found here, the function f0 (x) is essentially
negligible beyond a low value of x, in a substantial interval of E/N. Therefore, for

simplicity, all integrations were extended to infinity. For sodium, it was verified

that even at the upper end of the interesting range of E/N, the results differed by

only 2% from those obtained by cutting off the integrals at x=5.

The  drift  velocity  w(E/N)  of  electrons  swarming  through  sodium  vapor
was measured in [29] and was then used in [30] in order to recover the cross

section. Unfortunately, these results must be regarded with suspicion. The data

obtained  are  not  independent  of  pressure:  at  a  fixed  E/N,  the  measured  drift

velocity  falls  at  increased  pressure.  This  was  attributed  to  the  presence  of
dimers  (Na2)  and  “true”  drift  velocities  were  obtained  at  each  E/N  by
extrapolating the w(E/N,N) curves to zero pressure. However, as pointed out by

Elford  [36],  the  dimer  effect  should  actually  produce w(E/N,N) curves that rise

with N. On the other hand, the observed behavior is consistent with spurious

longitudinal diffusion due to deviations from spatial inhomogeneity, and indeed
the  latter  effect  might  be  unusually  large  because  the  drift  space  used  was
unduly short. But diffusion errors are known to increase at low pressure [36]. In
other words, the w(E/N) curve obtained by extrapolating to zero pressure could

well be less reliable than the higher-pressure curves.

It seemed advisable therefore to test our analytic cross section against

both  kinds  of  drift  velocity  data.  The  results  are  shown  in  figure  2.  The  red

points are from the extrapolated data (assuming T=803° K) and the black points

from  uncorrected  data  at  803°.  The  full  curves  are  obtained  using  (9)  with
σM(x)=aF(x)+B’,  [equivalently  F(x)+B’  with  σ 0  changed  to  σ’0 =aσ0 ]   with  the
constants

σ’0 =1000

(a≅0.93)
(a=1.05)

B’=200

B’=300

(red curve)

(black curve)

Both  fits  are  satisfactory  and  show  that  the  present  method  for

obtaining realistic momentum-transfer cross sections is a good one. Needless

to  say,  a  more  reliable  set  of  drift  velocity  data  would  be  required  for

establishing the analytic form of the true momentum-transfer cross section of

sodium.

Regardless  of  this,  the  results  of  [29]  are  useful  and  raise  some

interesting  points.  To  begin  with,  it  seems  that  the  red  curve  is  essentially  a

redrawing of the black one on a different scale of E/N. This suggests that the
difference  between  the  two  sets  of  data  might  be  due,  more  or  less,  to  a

systematic error in the determination of N. If this is the case then all one has to

do in order to obtain the true cross section is to find the correct value of B’.

Now let E* denote the value of E/N  at which the transport coefficients
begin  to  change  appreciably  due  to  inelastic  impacts  (particle-conserving
effects− such  as  excitation  and  superelastic  scattering − or  “reactive”
processes− such  as  cumulative  ionization  via  metastable  states,  direct
ionization, and attachment).

The trends, with respect to the experimental points, of the two “elastic”

drift velocity curves in figure 2, point to values of about 20 and 30 Td for E*.

These are respectively two and three times larger than the value obtained in
[30], as deduced from the knee at E/N≅ 9 in their mean energy curve.

This disagreement is most likely a consequence of the well-known lack
of  uniqueness  encountered  in  recovering  σM(x)  from  the  data  when  inelastic
collisions  are  incorporated  in  the  Boltzmann  equation.  When  that  procedure

was used in [30] (with the red points of figure 2) it produced a cross section that
decreases very rapidly (see the red points in figure 1). A steeper-falling σM(x)
produces  a  longer-tailed  energy  distribution  at  low  E/N,  and  hence  a  more

significant fraction, R, of electrons with energies exceeding 2.1 eV.

Remarkably,  that  narrower  cross  section  of  [30]  too,  can  be  obtained

from the basic profile (5) mainly by changing the value of B’, namely with B’=40
and σ’0 =1160 (a=1.2), as shown in figure 1.

The  value  of  the  fraction  R  resulting  from  this  form  for  σ M(x)  at
E/N=E*=9  is  50%.  With  our  large-B’  cross  sections  (respectively  B’=200  and

300), R is 2.8% and 0.05% at 9 Td. But at E*=20 and 30 Td, R is indeed close

to 50% (respectively 42% and 50%). Note that 50% need not be an implausibly
large proportion because the ratio of the largest inelastic cross section to σM(x)
for x≅ 2.1 is less than 0.1.

What  is  interesting  about  these  three  numbers  for  E*  is  the

corresponding value of the mean energy. The black upper and lower curves of
figure  3  show  the  function  εm(E/N)  computed  from  the  energy  distribution
resulting from the cross sections with B’ = 200 and 300, respectively. We see

that,  at  E/N=19.6  and  27,  close  to  the  approximate  points  where  the  drift
velocity  curves  deviate  from  the  respective  experimental  data,  εm  actually
reaches the inelastic threshold (say ε*). Moreover, the critical drift velocity w(E*)
is the same in both cases (about 40x10 4 cm/sec).

In contrast, the curve for εm obtained in [30] barely attains 0.5 eV before
tapering  off  at  about  E/N=9  Td;  a  similar  limitation  of  the  mean  energy  was
found in [31], from the black data in figure 2, using the theoretical σM(x) of [24]
which is still narrower.

When w(E/N) is computed with our fit to the cross section of [30] (with

B’=40), the deviation from the red points of figure 2, does in fact occur at about

E/N=9 Td (see the blue curve in figure 2), and the corresponding mean energy

is indeed only about 0.5 eV. However, w(E/N) slopes sharply upwards, so that

the deviation from the experimental curve is now in the opposite direction. That

type  of  behavior  would  require  very  large  superelastic  scattering  and  is

therefore inconsistent with merely exciting collisions. Nor is it consistent with a

simultaneous decrease in the mean energy (see subsection 4.3).

These  objections  indicate  that  the  inversion  procedures  used  in  [30]
and [31] biased as they are by the initial choice of too narrow an initial σM(x),
and  perhaps  on  questionably  accurate  inelastic  cross  sections,  lead  to

unphysical solutions.

This should be avoidable by starting the inversion procedure with our

Fano-type cross-section since the correct direction of the bend at E* imposes a

lower limit Bmin on B’. The value of Bmin can be found by trial and error. For the
red data of figure 2 it is indeed about 200.

We should note that there is also an upper limit Bmax. This can be seen
by noticing that the function σM(x) leading to the black curve of figure 2 is very
close to σT(x) since B’=B. But in adding a constant B to F(x) in (3) in order to fit
the total cross section, we are flirting with the unitary limit. Since a≅1, it follows
that a value of B’ larger than B is liable to violate unitarity and so we can say
that B’max≅300. Thus in the true σM(x) we should have 2 0 0 < B ’ < 300.

These  remarks  uphold  the  appropriateness  of  the  present  method  in

obtaining momentum-transfer cross sections.

The essence, however, of this argumentation is that in sodium (and by

analogy  in  other  elements  of  section  2),  the  elastic  cross  section  seems  to

impart a beam-like character to the swarm so that

(a) E* is the value of E/N where  εm(E/N)≅ε*.

(b) E*  is  also  obtainable  from  the  onset  of  deviation  of  the  purely

“elastic” drift velocity w(E/N) from the experimental data.

And incidentally

(c) A fortuitous systematic rescaling of E/N will not affect the values of

w(E*) and  ε

 (E*).

m

Notice that in the neighborhood of the inelastic threshold, σM(x) ≅ B’. Statement
(E*) and w(E*) are both proportional to E*/ σM(ε*), so that
(c) then indicates that ε
if B’1/ B’2 

≅ 2 / 3, then E*1/ E*2 

≅ 2 / 3, as in figure 2.

m

A more elaborate computational effort incorporating inelastic cross sections is

required in order to ascertain these inferences. But their plausibleness can be

demonstrated in terms of a simple physical framework, as will be seen in the

next subsection.

4.3. Testing the momentum-transfer approximation

As mentioned in section 1, a simple means for discussing transport phenomena

without  solving  the  Boltzmann  equation  is  provided  by  the  so-called

“momentum-transfer approximation”. It is interesting to see how our Boltzmann

results  compare  with  those  obtainable  from  the  basic  equations  of  that

approach [7-9].

For a spatially uniform swarm without a magnetic field, in the center of

mass of the atoms and the colliding swarm particles, these equations are

(12)

Notice that in (12), M is the atomic mass. The term Mw2/ 2 represents that part of
the energy that has been provided by the electric field but randomized by elastic

collisions.

The  function  Ω  describes  the  energy  loss  due  to  inelastic  or  reactive
effects. In the present case of homogeneous swarms it is positive, (excepting

the unlikely case of very strong superelastic collisions). Its exact form (see [7-8])

is not required here; the important point for our purposes is the behavior of this
function  below  threshold  (namely  εm < ε*).  Model  forms  of  Ω(εm)  based  on  a
Maxwellian  energy  distribution  extend  below  threshold  (see  [7])  but  it  is

plausible  that  with  the  narrow  distributions  induced  by  the  cross  sections  of
certain elements, this tail becomes negligible so that Ω( εm)≅0 for εm < ε*.

At εm ≅ ε*, we can set kT=0 for simplicity and solve (11) and (12) for w

and εm near Ω = 0, (where εm = ε*, E/N=E*, σ

(εm ) = σ*). The result is

M

εm = a1(E*/σ*) – a2 
 w = a3 (E*/σ*) + a4 

 Ω                  

 Ω                  

where the quantities ai are constants.

These equations explicitly incorporate the statements (a), (b) and (c) of

the  previous  subsection.  Moreover,  they  predict  the  correct  directions  for  the

bends away from the data in the εm(E/N) and w(E/N) curves at E/N≅E*.

An exact calculation of the function Ω(εm) requires a good knowledge of
several inelastic cross sections and is hardly an effortless task since the latter

are  not  expressible  analytically.  Therefore  it  was  not  attempted.  Hence,  the

validity of assertions (a-c) for sodium remains inferential.

It is easy however to test equations (11-12) in the “elastic” regime. The

red curves of figure 3 shows the mean energy computed from equation (12),
with Ω=0, using our interpolations of figure 2 to the two sets of experimental drift
velocity data. The agreement between these curves and the exact ones in the

range 0 < E/N < 30 is very good and shows how precise equation (12) can be for

calculating the mean energy in terms of the drift velocity data.

We can now calculate the function σ

(εm ).  Equations (11-12) imply that

  (13)

where of course εm= εm(E/N) is given by one of the red curves of figure 3 in their
respective ranges E/N < E * . 

Figure 4 shows the “cross section” σM(εm) computed in this manner, in

terms  of  the  lower  curve  of  figure  3  for  εm(E/N), along with the corresponding
σM(x) (the one with B’=300). Clearly, for x > 3/2kT, there is essentially a one-to-
one correspondence between x and εm. A similar agreement was obtained for
the cross section with B’=200. Consequently, a good set of data on w(E/N) and

the simple momentum-transfer approximation in terms of the mean energy  of

the  swarm  can  be  sufficient  for  obtaining  a  very  good  approximation  for  the

profile  of  the  momentum  transfer  cross  section,  as  well  as  its  absolute

M

magnitude, as a function of electron energy. The exact location of the peak of
(εm )  in figure 4 is at εm=0.124 (at which point E/N=1.96); the peak of σM(x) is
σ
at x=0.116. Note also that as E/N tends to zero and εm(E/N) approaches 3/2kT,
the right-hand side of (13) converges; σM(3/2kT) was found to be about 400 .

The derivation of equation (11) relies on the assumption that the energy
distribution is sharply peaked at εm, so that in averaging the collision frequency
ν  [where  ν(x)=N(2x/m)1 / 2 σM(x)]  the  main  contribution  comes  from  energies
around  x≅ εm  (see  [7]).  This  premise  is  clearly  borne  out  remarkably  well  in
sodium,  despite  the  fact  that  σM(x) is not a slowly varying function of x in the
region  of  the  peak.  Obviously,  some  rather  miraculous  fine-tuning  is  taking

place  in  this  case,  and  we  should  not  expect  to  find  the  same  degree  of

agreement in other elements.

But  regardless  of  such  details,  the  above  considerations  implicitly

support  our  previous  inference  that,  in  the  elements  considered  here,  the

“elastic”  electron  swarm  acquires  the  identity  of  a  blunt-fronted  beam  and

maintains this character throughout a considerable interval of E/N.

How close that interval is to the point where the corresponding mean

energy  reaches  the  inelastic  threshold  can  perhaps  be  ascertained  by
averaging the inelastic contributions in order to obtain the function Ω.

The  matter  of  condition  (a)  will  be  revisited  and  further  elucidated  in

section 6.2 in connection to mercury.

5. Magnesium

Theoretical values of the resonance energy x1 for Mg calculated in the literature
[10]  are  between  0.14  and  0.16  eV.  The  values  found  for  the  width  are  very
similar except for one case [32] where Γ1 = 0.24. However, equation (4) shows

that there is an upper bound Γmax for Γ1. In particular, for β=0, Γmax = α, (at q =1)
and so the values α = 0.19, Γ1 = 0.24, obtained in [32] are incompatible with an
initial estimate based on the Fano formula. Therefore we assumed that once
more x1 ≅ Γ1.

We base our fit on the premise that α = 0.18, β = 0.005. For q =1.9, the
resonance  parameters  resulting  from  (4)  are  x1 = 0.142,  Γ1 = 0.144.  Figure  5
shows our estimated Mg cross section obtained with (3) with the set

q=1.9, x1 = 0.142, Γ1= 0.144, x2 =1.74, Γ2 = 5, σ0 = 800, B = 71

      (14)

where B is deduced from the calculation of the scattering length in [13]. With
this  value  of  B,  the  choice σ0 = 800 places the peak height at about the value
found in [32]. The final values of the extrema are α = 0.182, β = 0.005.

Unfortunately,  no  transport  results  are  available  for  testing  the

analogous momentum-transfer cross section. The only experimental information

available for comparison is contained indirectly in the transmission experiment
of Burrow et al. [16]. A signal of the resonance in the negative derivative of the
transmitted  current  was  reported  in  [33]  but  this  is  too  distorted  by  the  beam

energy distribution to be usable for a meaningful comparison.

In  figure  6,  the  constant  A  has  been  adjusted  in  order  to  fit  the

expression  exp [-AF(x)]  to  the  experimental  curve  of  [16]  within  the  leeway

permitted by the stated 0.03 eV uncertainty in the energy scale. In view of the

lack  of  corrections  for  the  beam  width,  the  agreement  is  as  good  as  can  be
expected. Of course, this result is independent of the values of σ0 and B. It does
indicate, however, that the hump attributed to the (3s2 3p 2D) state is reproduced

correctly in our generalized Fano profile. A similar agreement was obtained in

[32] in terms of their calculated cross section.

6. Mercury

6.1. Derivation of the analytic cross section

In comparison to other elements, the list of experiments dealing with the

low-energy  shape  resonance  in  mercury  is  quite  numerous.  The  initial

determinations of the location of the peak in the cross section were obtained

from  swarm  data  in  [34]  and  from  a  transmission  experiment  in  [16].  These

values were very similar (about 0.65 eV). Unfortunately they were both wrong.
The  former  because  the  drift  velocity  data  used  was  inaccurate  due  to  Hg2
formation  and  to  diffusion  effects  [36].  The  latter  because  of  a  fortuitous

miscalibration of an X-Y recorder [41].

Subsequent beam experiments [35,17] placed the peak of σT at about
0.4 and 0.4 2 ± 0.3 eV, respectively. And a first attempt to obtain σM from w(E/N)

data  (at  T=573°,  corrected  for  dimer  and  diffusion  effects)  showed  a  peak  at

about 0.5 eV [36]. Later on, the use of mixtures in order to weaken the pressure

dependence of the dimer effect, and a thorough treatment of diffusion errors,

lowered  the  swarm  value  of  the  peak  to  0.44  [37].  Thus,  given  the  different

uncertainties in beam and swarm data, it seems safe to say that the “best” value

for the peak in either cross section is close to 0.4 eV.

In regard to theory, the treatment of an element as heavy as mercury

must include relativistic effects. Such a calculation was first reported in [38]. It

was found that there is substantial fine structure splitting of the doublet lowest

state  of  the  negative  ion,  leading  to  two  resonances  at  about  0.2  and  0.4 eV
corresponding to the 2P1/ 2 and 2P3/ 2 states. The latter is broader than the former
but apparently not broad enough to prevent the formation of two distinct peaks
in  σT(x).  A  different  theoretical  treatment  [39]  also  gave  separated  peaks  at
somewhat different energies.

The  clear  definition  of  peak  separation  displayed  in  [38-39]  would

doubtless show up in the transmission experiment of Johnston and Burrow [17].

Its absence has led to some confusion, as underlined in [10].

Initially,  the  author  of  [38]  argued  that  the  true  width  of  the  2P 3/ 2
resonance (presumably the value obtainable by including a larger set of states

in the decay channel) is such that this resonance will be indistinguishable from

the background.

An alternative is to adopt the attitude that because the results are very

sensitive  to  the  precise  form  of  the  polarization  potential,  one  must  seek  a

parametric  form  for  this  potential  that  can  be  adjusted  to  give  a  peak  in  the

cross  section  at  the  observed  energy.  This  artifact  is  able  to  produce  a

momentum-transfer  cross  section  that  is  not  greatly  dissimilar  from  the  one

deduced  from  swarm  data  in  [37].  A  different  theory  based  on  the  same

principle  was  presented  recently  in  [40];  but  while  the  peak  in  the  resulting

momentum-transfer  cross-section  is  in  excellent  agreement  with  experiment,
the total cross section is not: the peak in σT appears at 0.55 eV, in clear conflict
with beam data.

As we will see, the present work resolves this controversy. Namely the
energies resulting from the ab initio theory of [38] are entirely consistent with a

single-peaked generalized Fano profile formed by two overlapping resonances

at about 0.2 and 0.4, with widths of 0.34 and 1.1, respectively.

Unlike the cases of Na and Mg, there is now a sufficiently undistorted

experimental profile of the entire peak region (figure 1 of [17]) on which we can

base our construction without unconvolving the beam energy distribution. This
graph  is  proportional  to  the  negative  of  the  derivative  of  σT(x)  and  gives  the
values of α and β directly. Actually I used a copy of this recording that extends
to a wider energy range [41].

The first step is to write the conventional Fano form (1) in terms of α
and  β  using  equation  (4),  with  α=0.42  and  β=0.01,  and  to  vary  q  until  the
negative derivative of this expression matches the experimental curve. It turns

out that this is feasible up to a positive additive constant. A good fit is obtained
with  q=0.6  by  starting  with  α=0.51  and  adding  about  (3/5)σ0  to  the  negative
derivative. This combination drives α   back to 0.42 and gives x1≅ 0.14, Γ1≅ 0.44.
But the need for the additive constant in the derivative implies that equation (1)

does  not  adequately  represent  the  dynamics,  since  a  steeply  decreasing
background contribution [roughly – (3/5) σ 0 x]  is  being  left  out  of  the  integrated
cross section.

In  the  next  step  we  use  these  preliminary  values  in  the  (single  q)

resonance form of equation (2) and try to obtain a fit with reasonable values of
x2 and Γ2 . Satisfactory agreement is obtained with the set of parameters

q= 0.61, x1= 0.145, Γ1= 0.39, x2 = 0.34, Γ2 = 1.65

 (15)

where every effort was made to make x1 as large as possible. The final value of
β  is  0.025.  Remarkably,  the  energy-dependent  background  found  in  the  first
step is now automatically absorbed into the Breit-Wigner factor. Yet this result is
still incompatible with theory because x1 is 30% lower than the calculated value.

In  the  final  step  we  use  equation  (2)  with  two  resonances.  A  cross

section matching the experimental curve is now obtainable with a larger value of
x1 . This fit is shown in figure 7.  The parameters are

 q1 = 1.85, x1 = 0.185, Γ1 = 0.34, q2 = 2.1, x2 = 0.395, Γ2 = 1.1, x3 = 0.9, Γ3 = 2.9   (16)

Both x1  and x2 are now close to the theoretical values of Walker [38].
The final value of β is negative. Apart from that, the profiles of steps 2 and 3 are
almost completely identical. The mismatch at very low energy is inherent to the

method and is not germane in the context of swarm experiments (see section

9).

These results show how fruitless it is to guess the energies (let alone

the widths) of these shape resonances in terms of the peak in the cross section.

In the cross section defined by (16), the peak is actually close to the energy of
the  2P3/ 2  state,  whereas  the  2P1/ 2  state  has  the  character  of  a  “window”
resonance since its position coincides with the lower extremum of the derivative
of σT(x).

The  onset  of  disagreement  with  the  experimental  curve  on  the  high-

energy side indicates that our profile levels off too early. This can probably be

corrected by incorporating more resonances  (the  2D states), but we have not

gone that far in this work.

Figure 8 shows a fit to the total cross section of Jost and Ohnemus [35],

obtained with our profile (16) and

σ0 = 43.2

B = 300

(17)

We see that for 0.15 < x < 2.3, more or less, our analytic σM(x) matches

the cross sections of both beam experiments.

6.2. Calculating transport coefficients

As  with  sodium,  we  construct  a  momentum  transfer  cross  section  in  order  to

compare  the  drift  velocity  w(E/N)  (computed  by  equation  (9)  with  T=573°  and
M/m=6072)  to  the  experimental  results.  A  large  collection  of  the  carefully
corrected  data  of  [37]  is  listed  in  [40].  Figure  9  shows  the  fit  to  these  points
obtained with σM(x)=F(x)+B’ using the (double q) profile defined by (16), and

σ’0 = 39.3 

B’ = 97

An identical fit is obtained from the (single q) profile of equation (15),

with the constants

σ’0 = 442.5

B’ = 91

(18)

(19)

 

Evidently, the swarm data in this range of E/N is insensitive to the small

difference of these profiles at very low energy.

At  first  sight  the  agreement  with  experiment  of  our  drift  velocity  in

mercury is excellent. It must be pointed out, however, that to some extent this
might  be  fortuitous.  Unlike  sodium,  the  resemblance  of  our  σ T(x)  to  the
experimental total cross section is not good all the way to threshold. The same
is true for σM(x), as seen in figure 8 where our momentum-transfer cross section
is  compared  to  the  one  derived  in  [37]  from  the  same  drift  velocity  data.
Obviously, with the present profile F(x), the upper limit, xmax,  of  validity  of  the
approximation “B=constant” does not exceed 2.5 eV. As a result, the highest

calculated drift velocities are uncertain. Indeed, at the upper end E/N=3 of the

range of E/N, our values (obtained by integrating to infinity) differ by 8% from

those  obtained  by  cutting  off  the  integrals  at  x=5.  For  sodium,  one  could
calculate w(E/N) all the way to E* before that difference exceeded 2%.

Therefore,  for  mercury,  any  definitive  claims  in  regard  to  E*  and  to

inferences (a-c) of section 4.2 must await the refinement of our present profile

by incorporating more resonances.

On the other hand, since there is no sign of departure of our computed

w(E/N)  curve  from  the  experimental  points,  one  might  disregard  these

misgivings and still compute the value of E* from condition (a). The black curve
in figure 10 shows the mean energy εm(E/N) obtained by equation (10) using the
energy distribution arising from either of our two cross sections. The value of E*

resulting from this graph is about 5.5.

The  fraction  R  of  electrons  with  x > 4.67  calculated  with  our  energy
distribution is less than 2x10 -11% at 1 Td and it is still only 2.8% at 3 Td. At 5.5
Td (our presumed value for E*) it reaches 43%, which was about the proportion

needed  for  producing  an  observable  deviation  from  the  data  of  the  elastic

w(E/N) curve of sodium (see section 4.2).

It appears therefore that in mercury too, a scenario much like (a) and

(b) of section 4.2 is probably taking place.

Collateral support is obtained by observing the evolution of the energy

distribution (see figure 11). We see that, as E/N is raised, the increase in the

fraction R is not due as much to a lengthening tail, as to the buildup of a second

hump  in  the  distribution.  As  E/N  is  raised,  this  hump  moves  toward  higher

energy and grows at the expense of the low energy peak.

This  is  borne  out  experimentally,  because  the  electron  energy

distribution in mercury has actually been measured, on two occasions. The first

measurement was carried out a while ago in a “low-voltage” arc [42] and the

second  more  recently  [43]  in  a  Franck-Hertz  experiment.  These  are  only

piecemeal  swarm  experiments  since,  overall,  the  effect  of  spatial  density

gradients and space charge phenomena is far from negligible. Still, they both

show the presence of two distinct peaks. In these measurements, however, the

low-energy  peak  (at  less  than  1  eV  as  in  figure  11)  is  substantially  more

pronounced,  while  the  high-energy  peak  is  weak  and  centered  above  the

inelastic threshold.

Such evidence of clean-cut peak formation suggests that condition (a)
is indeed implemented and might in fact be enforced self-consistently. Below

the critical value of E/N, as the higher-energy hump grows, any small portion of

its tail intruding past the excitation threshold is quickly clipped off by inelastic

collisions,  with  resulting  blunting  of  the  front  and  replenishment  of  the  low-

energy peak. In this way, the swarm is even more likely to reach the inelastic

threshold  in  bulk.  At  that  point,  the  population  of  the  higher-energy  group

declines  sharply  and  the  low-energy  peak  is  enhanced  dramatically,  as

indicated by experiment.

6.3. Testing the momentum-transfer approximation

As  with  sodium,  it  is  worthwhile  to  compare  the  results  obtained  from  the

Boltzmann  equation  to  those  found  from  the  momentum  and  energy  balance

equations of the momentum-transfer approximation.

  The  red  curve  of  figure  10  shows  the  average  energy  εm(E/N)
calculated  from  equation  (12)  using  our  computed  interpolation  w(E/N)  to  the

experimental drift velocity in the range of available data. Figure 12 displays the
M(εm) obtained with these values of εm(E/N), along with  σM(x).
function σ

In both cases the agreement is less impressive than in sodium, but is

still  qualitatively  correct.  The  mean  energy  runs  parallel  to  the  Boltzmann-
M(εm) calculated from
equation curve but is somewhat lower, while the function σ
equation  (13)  is  narrower  than  σM(x)  with  a  peak  at  0.25  eV  (at  which  point
E/N=1.4). The lower limit σM(3/ 2kT) of the function σ
M(εm)  was  found  to  be  52
and 65, respectively, for the σM(x) of equations (15,19) and (16,18).

Obviously, the degree of deviation of equation (12) from the true mean
M(εm) to σM(x) depend on the detailed structure of
energy and the closeness of σ
the  peak  profile.  Expectedly,  not  all  profiles  conspire  as  well  as  they  do  in
sodium for producing a one-to-one correspondence between x and εm.

7. A model for negative differential conductivity (NDC)

Figure  13(a)  shows  three  hypothetical  “mercury”  momentum-transfer  cross

sections given by equations (2-3) with a single resonance, for different values of
q, and corresponding ones for σ0, namely

q= {0.8; 1.2; 1.6}, x1 = 0.5, Γ1 = 0.2, x2 = 0.8, Γ2 = 4, σ0 = {600; 400; 280},   B=10   (20)

They all display a deep Townsend minimum followed by a peak of about 1000
2 at x ≅ 0.6 eV. Figure 13(b) shows the drift velocity resulting from these cross
a0
sections at T=573° with the mercury value of M/m. The black and red curves

are very similar in shape and magnitude to the uncorrected experimental w(E/N)

curves  for  mercury  obtained  originally  in  [44]  and  later  in  [30]  and  [36].  This
explains why the early derivations of σM(x) for Hg from inversion of uncorrected
swarm data produce a peak at about 0.6 eV, preceded by a very precipitous cliff

as in [34], and can even feature a substantial dip as in [30].

It is currently accepted [36-37] that in mercury the change of slope of

w(E/N), in a certain interval of E/N, leading to negative differential conductivity

(namely dw/dE< 0) is due to the presence of dimers. The above examples show

that  this  effect  can  be  modelled  by  an  effective  momentum-transfer  cross

section  whose  profile  displays  a  substantial  dip  molded  by  a  resonance.  An

additional  constraint  is  that  the  resonance  profile  must  be  rather  symmetric,
namely q >1. The larger the value of q the deeper is the minimum of w(E/N). In
our examples the minimum in w(E/N) disappears for q≅ 0.8, even though the dip
in σ(x) is more pronounced [see figure 13(b)].

Transport theory has led to the belief that the NDC phenomenon can

not occur for electrons in a pure gas in the presence of only elastic collisions.
One needs either a mixture of monatomic gases [45] or some kind of inelastic
process [7].

The  latter  case  has  been  more  fully  illustrated  recently  by  Blake  and
Robson [46] in terms of equations (11-12) using appropriate models of Ω(εm ). It

is  interesting  to  note  that  the  “shape”  requirement  dΩ/dεm < –1  for  NDC,
established  in  [7]  and  [46]  for  inelastic  collisions,  is  very  similar  to  our

asymmetry criterion q >1.

Obviously, a mixture of atoms and their dimers produces an effective

cross  section  of  this  type.  But  perhaps  NDC  could  arise  from  purely  elastic

scattering  in  elements  such  as  Ca  and  Sr  by  means  of  the  deep  Ramsauer-

Townsend  minimum  mentioned  in  section  2.  However,  as  noted  in  section  9,

this  cannot  be  verified  by  constructing  a  generalized  Fano  profile  unless  the

present prescription is amendable in order to include the contribution of the s-

wave.

It is easily verified that for those cross sections of (19) where q >1, the

momentum-transfer approximation fails completely in the critical region of E/N.

After  the  initial  rise,  the  mean  energy  derived  from  equation  (12)  does  not

merely level off close to the true mean energy, as in figure 10, but acquires a
minimum. The result is that the function σ(εm) satisfying the system of equations
(11,12) is hardly a physical cross-section since it becomes double-valued in the

region  of  the  minimum.  Understandably,  the  storage  of  the  field  energy  is

interrupted, and the term Mw2/2 is meaningless in the critical region.

The model cross sections of figure 13(a) can also be used to illustrate

the formation of double-peaked energy distributions that have been observed to
accompany  the  onset  of  NDC.  It  is  readily  calculated  that  both  f0(x)  and  the
anisotropic  component  f1(x)  display  two  peaks  separated  by  a  deep  valley
located at the energy where the cross sections go through a minimum. It should

be  noted  however  that  this  occurs  even  in  the  case  where  q=0.8  and  is  thus

independent  of  NDC  itself,  as  in  the  analogous  case  involving  inelastic

collisions [46]. Similar double peaked energy distributions were shown to arise

in  a  swarm  through  molecular  nitrogen  and  were  interpreted  in  terms  of

vibrational excitation in collaboration with momentum transfer collisions [47].

8. A multi-peaked profile.

So far, we have dealt with overlapping resonances producing a single

peak  in  the  elastic  cross  section.  One  may  wonder  how  the  method  of

generalized  Fano  profiles  fares  in  cases  where  the  cross  section  displays

several  sharp  peaks,  and  whether  any  of  this  finer  structure  shows  up  in  the

function σ(εm)  calculated  from  equation  (13).  To  answer  these  questions  we
constructed  a  profile  resembling  the  theoretical  cross  section  of  cesium

computed in [11]. The result is shown in figure 14 (blue curve). The parameters

(with energies in meV) are given by

q1 = 15, x1 = 2.5, Γ1= 1.1, q2 = 1.9, x2 = 6, Γ2 = 1.15, x3 = 15, Γ3 = 6             (21)

σ0 = 4300

B =1000 

 (22)

The red curve in figure 14 shows σ

M(εm)   computed at T=5.8° K. As we
see, the structure is blurred into a single peak close to the first resonance. We

note that the isotropic energy distribution is double peaked, but the anisotropic
component contains three distinct peaks at low energy (for E/N ≅ 0.04), as well
as a fourth at higher energy. In both components, the extra higher-lying peak is

analogous to the higher-energy hump in mercury mentioned in section 6.2.

9. The region of ultra-low energies

We conclude this paper with some comments on the shape of our generalized
Fano cross sections in the region of thermal energies.

For  mercury,  a  test  of  the  accuracy  of  σ M(x)  near  x=0  is  available
[37,40] in terms of the thermal diffusion coefficient   NDth at 470° K measured in
[48]. This experimental value is 1.74 ± 0.17 x1021 cm-1 s-1. The number obtained

with our cross section of equations (16,18) is 1.05x 1021  cm-1 s-1, which is too
low. The authors of [40] point out that an improved value of NDth is obtainable if
the  cross  section  displays  a  dip  near  zero  energy.  Such  a  dip  occurs  in  the

cross  section  defined  by  equations  (15,19)  and  indeed  this  profile  yields  the
better value NDth = 1.32x 1021 cm-1 s-1.   The actual presence  of  a minimum in the
total cross section at about 0.1 eV is suggested from the experimental curve of
[17]  (see  figure  7).  In  σM(x),  it  might  be  more  pronounced  since  B ’ < B  and
ultimately σM(0) will have to be equal to σT(0).

Having said this, we must emphasize that, as it stands, our approach is
in  principle  unable  to  represent  the  cross  section  accurately   at  ultra-low
energies.  The  formation  of  the  lowest  extremum  of  σT(x)  is  often  affected
considerably  by  a  locally  rapidly  varying  s-wave  contribution  (see  [13]).
Therefore,  neither  is  the  true  value  of  β  related  entirely  to  the  effective
Hamiltonian  on  which  (2)  is  based,  nor  is  it  justifiable  to  assume  that  the

quantity B is constant throughout the low-energy region.

Perhaps one can extend σT(x)  all  the  way  to  zero  by  adding  a  virtual
(negative energy) state. But this form need not be representative of σM(x). At
any rate, some sort of modification would surely be necessary if one were to

apply this method to Ca and Sr since the pronounced Ramsauer minimum in

these  elements  is  shaped  in  large  measure  by  the  s-wave.  In  the  elements

considered  here,  the  dip  is  quite  small  and  will  only  affect  the  transport

coefficients at very low values of E/N.

Abstract:  Experimental  demonstration  of  a  negative  permeability  due  to 
near-field coupling of periodic thin silver strips is presented. Two samples 
with different strip thicknesses are fabricated; optical  measurements of the 
samples  confirm  our  initial  design  projections  by  showing  the  real  part  of 
permeability to be about −1 for the sample with thinner strips and −0.8 for 
the sample with thicker strips at wavelengths of 770 nm and 720 nm.

values  of  far-field  reflectance  and  transmittance  due  to  a  given  film.  Using  this  technique 
[1,2],  the  complex  values  of  the  transmitted  and  reflected  fields  are  obtained  either  from 
optical experiments or simulations; thus with this method, the effective parameters are always 
obtained indirectly. 

Optical  negative  index  materials  (NIMs),  also  known  as  left-handed  materials,  are 
artificially engineered metal-dielectric composites that exhibit n' < 0 within a limited range of 
wavelengths.  In  addition,  a  magnetic  resonant  behavior  should  be  observed  in  NIMs  at  this 
range. The magnetic resonance in any optical NIM is always required to make the real part of 
the effective refractive index negative, either through the strong (sufficient) condition μ' < 0 
and ε' < 0, or through a more general necessary condition ε'μ'' + μ'ε'' < 0, which is valid for a 
passive  medium.  The  general  condition  strictly  implies  that  there  is  no  negative  refraction 
effect in a passive metamaterial with μ = 1 + 0ι. Nonetheless, the effect is also achievable for 
μ' > 0  provided  that  only  ε' < 0  in  ε'μ'' + μ'ε'',  and  |ε'μ| > |μ'ε|.  In  the  latter  case,  substantial 
‘magnetic’ losses are necessary along with a dominant metal content in the structure. We note 
that a ratio of n'/n'' is often taken as a figure of merit (FOM) for NIM performance, since low-
loss  NIMs  are  desirable.  The  FOM  can  be  rewritten  as  |n'/n''| = |ε'|μ| + μ'|ε||/|ε''|μ| + μ''|ε||, 
indicating that a ‘double-negative’ NIM (μ' < 0, ε' < 0) will have a much better figure of merit 
than a NIM layer with μ' > 0. Therefore, metal-dielectric composites with a negative effective 
permeability  are  essential  for  further  development  of  low-loss  optical  NIMs  and  their 
applications. 

Our  recent  computational  results  [3]  have  demonstrated  that  pairs  of  thin  silver  strips 
separated by a dielectric spacer could offer an easy way of achieving negative magnetism by 
coupling near-field modes. It has also been shown that the magnetic resonance of a periodic 
array  of  coupled  silver  strips  with  sub-wavelength  periodicity  is  always  accompanied  by  an 
electric  anti-resonance  that  is  fundamentally  different  from  that  obtained  for  the  case  of  an 
isolated strip pair of the same structural dimensions and materials. Recent studies [3-5] show 
that  the  destructive  effect  of  the  electric  anti-resonance,  which  makes  ε'  (as  well  as  n') 
positive, can be straightforwardly compensated by adding background metallic elements (non-
resonant  strips,  homogeneous  or  inhomogeneous  films),  and  that  it  is  mostly  the  negative 
effective permeability that holds the key for advancing the design of low-loss NIMs in optics. 
Previous  important  results  with  different  periodic  metal-dielectric  composites  have  already 
been obtained in the terahertz and subsequently in the infrared ranges [5-7]. (Herein, we are 
not considering a recent report on negative magnetism in the green light range shown in [8]; 
in  our  opinion  the  report  is  inconclusive,  and  its  ambiguities  have  been  indicated  and 
discussed separately in [9].) 

This  paper  deals  with  the  experimental  observation  of  a  negative  permeability  in  the 
visible  range  due  to  near-field  coupling  of  periodic  thin  silver  strips.  For  our  study,  two 
samples (denoted Sample A and B) with slightly different geometries have been fabricated. A 
negative effective permeability has been retrieved using numerical simulations, and the results 
are  in  good  agreement  with  the  transmission  and  reflection  spectra  obtained  from  optical 
measurements  of  each  sample.  The  value  of  μ'  is  about  −1  in  Sample  A  and  about  −0.8  in 
Sample B at the wavelengths of 770 nm and 720 nm, respectively. In addition to the predicted 
negative  permeability  and  electric  anti-resonances,  abnormal  anisotropic  losses  near  the 
resonances  are  also  observed  experimentally.  Thus,  we  demonstrate  a  negative  magnetic 
response from a periodic optical material at visible (red) light and, even more importantly, we 
discuss new challenges due to significant changes in the optical properties of thin silver strips 
observed at the resonances. 

Figure 1(a) shows an initial ideal elementary cell that we have used to optimize a negative 
permeability sub-wavelength grating. It consists of a pair of thin silver strips (with thickness 
t  and width  w ). The strips are separated by an alumina spacer with thickness  d , width  w , 
and a refractive index of 
. The sub-wavelength lattice constant of the grating is 
p .  The  structure  has  been  optimized  using  custom  code  based  on  the  spatial  harmonic 
analysis  (SHA)  approach  [10]  with  additional  fabrication  constraints  pertinent  to  electron

beam lithography. In the optimal structure the periodicity p  was chosen to be 300 nm with t = 
35 nm, d = 40 nm, and w = 140 nm, and isotropic bulk optical properties of silver have been 
taken  from  [11].  In  the  resonant  (TM)  polarization  the  magnetic  field  is  aligned  with  the 
largest dimension – the infinite length of the strips. Only one component of the magnetic field 
should  ideally  be  present  in  this  case.  In  the  non-resonant  (TE)  polarization  the  single 
component of the electric field is aligned with the strip length, giving no resonant effects. In 
such  an  ideal  sub-wavelength  grating  of  Fig.  1(a),  a  relatively  wide  negative  magnetic 
response  exists  in  the  TM  regime  and  extends  from  a  wavelength  of  720  nm  to  825  nm,  as 
shown in Fig. 1(c). A sharp electric resonance behavior is also demonstrated for the structure 
in  TM  mode  around  500  nm.  The  electric  resonance  introduces  a  magnetic  anti-resonance 
response  within  their  common  wavelength  range.  A  reversed  effect  is  observed  at  the 
magnetic  resonance,  where  the  electric  anti-resonance  is  now  present.  The  presence  of  anti-
resonance  makes  it  difficult  to  overlap  the  magnetic  and  electric  resonances,  since  as  the 
electric  and  magnetic  resonances  get  closer  to  each  other  the  anti-resonances  increase  in 
strength, resulting in damping of the resonances [3].

addition, two thin 10-nm layers of alumina are added, one between the lower silver strip and 
the substrate and the second on top of the structure. Both additional alumina layers appear to 
be necessary for the stable fabrication of samples. Electron beam lithography techniques have 
been used  to  fabricate  the  samples.  First,  the geometry  of  the periodic thin  silver  strips was 
defined on a glass substrate initially coated with a 15-nm film of indium-tin-oxide (ITO) by 
use  of  an  electron  beam  writer.  Then,  electron  beam  evaporation  was  applied  to  produce  a 
stack of lamellar films. Finally, a lift-off process was performed to obtain the desired silver 
strips. The projected serial structure of the films from the ITO-coated glass was: Sample A, 
10-nm alumina, 30-nm silver, 40-nm alumina, 30-nm silver, 10-nm alumina; Sample  B, 10-
nm alumina, 35-nm silver, 40-nm alumina, 35-nm silver, 10-nm alumina. As an example of 
the fabricated structure, a FE SEM image of Sample A is shown in Fig. 2(a).

To test the fabricated samples, we measured the transmission and reflection spectra of the 
samples  with an ultra-stable  tungsten  lamp  (B&W  TEK BPS100).  The spectral range of  the 
lamp covers the entire visible and near-infrared optical band. A Glan Taylor prism was placed 
at  the  output  of  the  broadband  lamp  to  select  the  light  with  desired  linear  polarization.  The 
signal  transmitted  (or  reflected)  from  the  sample  was  introduced  into  a spectrograph  (Acton 
SpectraPro 300i) and is eventually collected by a liquid nitrogen cooled CCD-array detector. 
The transmission and reflection spectra were normalized to a bare substrate and a calibrated 
silver mirror, respectively. In the TE regime the electric field of the incident light was linearly 
polarized parallel to the length of silver strips, while in TM mode the electric field was rotated 
90  degrees  relative  to  TE  case.  For  example,  Figs.  2(b)  and  2(c)  show  transmission  and 
reflection  spectra  obtained  from  the  optical  measurements  of  Sample  A  for  TE  and  TM 
polarizations at normal incidence. 

In our simulations with a commercial finite element software (more suitable for modeling 
the  exact  geometrical  details  of  the  structure  than  the  SHA  code),  an  incident  plane  wave 
source  was  placed  at  the  source  end  of  the  computational  domain,  and  the  transmitted  and 
reflected  field  amplitudes  were  monitored  at  two  points  located  inside  the  domain  several 
wavelength away from the film under test. 

The optical constants of silver used in the ideal model have been initially taken from the 
experimental data [11] to obtain the optimal structure; as a result, a substantially negative  μ′  
has  been  obtained,  as  shown  in  Fig.  1(c).  In  the  ideal  situation,  both  the  experimental  and 

simulation setup would allow for an adequate match of the reflection and transmission spectra 
of  light  in  both  polarizations.  The  transmission  spectrum  with  TE  polarization  is  shown  in 
Fig. 2(c). In this case, as expected, both spectra match well over a broad range of measured 
wavelengths. The measured spectra display a moderate non-resonant wavelength dependence 
and low, almost constant, absorption; transmission falls off closer to the higher wavelengths. 
The  relaxed  wavelength  dependence  is  attributed  to  non-resonant  behavior  of  the  metallic 
strips  diluted  with  the  alumina  spacer  in  a  layer  that  could  be  adequately  described  by  an 
effective medium theory. Good matching occurs almost everywhere, provided that the light in 
the measured and simulated structures has a single propagating mode (no diffraction). Beyond 
950 nm, the signal-to-noise ratio worsens, making signal detection difficult at the output.  

A  useful  feature  of  the  optical  TE  measurements  is  that  the  spectral  position  of  the 
dλ ,  is  a  direct  indicator  of  the  true  effective 
diffraction  threshold,  shown  in  Fig.  2(c)  as 
periodicity observed in the experiment. Indeed, as long as the refractive index of the substrate, 
sn , is known almost exactly, a simple and accurate measurement of the actual period can be 
obtained from

Similar  to  the  TE  mode,  the  TM  polarization  gives  useful  data  for  measuring  the  actual 
geometry  of  the  samples  obtained  after  fabrication.  Specifically,  the  spectral  position  of  the 
electric and magnetic resonances  eλ  and  mλ shown in Fig. 2(c) are both very sensitive to the 
thickness and width of the metallic strips. Good agreement with the experimental spectra of 
Figs. 2(c) and 2(b) has been achieved by varying these parameters within realistic fabrication 
tolerances. Thus, the silver strips used in the simulation of Sample A were 4 nm thinner and 
8 nm wider than initial estimates from FE SEM images. Additional examinations of FE SEM 
images taken in a number of areas over the sample are consistent with this result. As expected, 
spectroscopic measurements appeared to be more accurate for the dimensions that are critical 
in  the  resonant  regimes,  giving  a  better  result  than  estimates  based  on  FE  SEM  images.  In 
addition,  clear-cut  optical  measurements  of  transmission  and  reflection  spectra  with  both 
polarizations incorporate and level out imperfections inevitable in the fabrication process. The 
dimensions  of  the  samples  taken  in  the  simulations  are:  Sample  A,  t  =  26  nm,  d = 48 nm, 
wt = 94 nm, and wb = 174 nm; Sample B, t = 35 nm, d = 40 nm, wt = 90 nm, and wb = 160 nm. 

In contrast to TE case, where the optical constants of the bulk silver are used to describe 
the optical behavior of silver strips, the TM polarization reveals substantial discrepancies in 
the optical properties of nano-structured silver strips vs. the data shown for bulk silver in [11]. 
Specifically,  the  experimental  loss  is  more  than  that  obtained  through  simulations.  This 
enhanced loss is due to the roughness and other imperfection in the fabricated structure. We 
model  these  imperfections  through  an  adjustment  factor  ( α ),  such  that  the  permittivity  of 
silver is given by,  ε
. This deviation appears to be significant at the electric and 
magnetic  resonance.  Since  at  the  resonances  the  spatial  spectral  content  of  the  near-field  is 
radically increasing, we conclude that the near-field modes interact with the inhomogeneities 
of  the  silver,  resulting  in  additional  losses.  The  dominant  symmetric  modes  of  the  electric 
resonance  are  less  sensitive  to  the  non-idealities  of  the  strips,  since  relatively  smaller 
adjustments of  ε′′  in silver are necessary around the electric resonance. At the same time, the 
steeper  gradients  of  the  asymmetric  modes  dominant  at  the  magnetic  resonance  are  much 
more  sensitive  to  structural  defects,  dislocations  and  surface  roughness  of  the  strips  and  a 
substantial adjustment of losses is required.

Computed  results  of  the  transmission  and  reflection  spectra  with  an  adjusted  dispersion 
relation  for  the  permittivity  of  bulk  silver  along  the  non-transverse  directions  are  shown  in 
Figs. 2(c) and 3(c), along with the spectra of adjustment factor  α  shown in Fig. 3(b). In both 
samples the adjustment is high at the electric resonance. The adjustment becomes almost one 
between the two resonances, and eventually reaches its upper level of about six for Sample A 
and almost seven for Sample B. The additional losses in the resonant regimes of the strips are 
very  large.  Unfortunately,  these  losses  diminish  the  negative  magnetic  response  over  the 
entire range of the magnetic resonance.

Fig. 3. (a) FE SEM picture of Sample B. (b) Comparison of the loss-adjustment 
factor  α   obtained  for  Samples  A  and  B.  Sample  B  demonstrates  more 
excessive loss in comparison to bulk metal [11] and Sample A. (c) Transmission 
and  reflection  spectra  of  Sample  A  at  normal  incidence  with  TM  polarization

permeability ( μ′ ) and effective permittivity ( ε′ ). 

 
The ideal spectra of  μ′  computed without any adjustment to the permittivity of bulk silver 
and  the  values  of  μ′   calculated  with  the  adjustment  factor  of  Fig.  3(b)  have  been  also 
compared.  Relative  to  the  ideal  metal,  negative  magnetism  is  reduced  by  a  factor  of  7.8  in 
Sample A and by a factor of 8.8 in Sample B. By measuring and comparing the transmission 
and  reflection  of  other  samples  with  different  fabrication  conditions,  the  average  loss 
adjustment factor of the anisotropic permittivity of silver is estimated to range from six to nine 
over  the  entire  magnetic  resonance.  Although  the  actual  range  of  the  adjustment  factor  α  
depends  greatly  both  on  the  initial  design  of  the  magnetically  resonant  structure  and  its 
fabrication conditions, these estimates provide approximate margins for the adjusted values of 
losses in resonant nano-structured silver structures in the visible light range. 

In  summary,  we  designed,  fabricated  and  measured  two  samples  with  negative 
permeability of –1 and –0.8 at 770 nm and 720 nm, respectively. Detailed numerical models 
of the samples have been used to validate the measurements, where an adjusted wavelength-
dependent  ε′′  is used in silver at the resonances. The results of the numerical modeling are 
compared  with  the  experimental  data.  The  good  agreement  between  experiment  and  theory 
achieved  for  two  different  polarizations  in  a  wide  range  of  wavelength  is  an  excellent 
confirmation  of  the  validity  of  the  model,  hence  confirming  the  existence  of  negative 
permeability at red light. We also discuss the difficulties in automated optimization of NIMs 
due to substantial deviations from the properties of bulk metal observed experimentally in the 
resonant plasmonic elements of our nano-structured samples. These deviations would require 
constant feedback from fabrication and measurements for obtaining double-negative NIMs in 
visible range.

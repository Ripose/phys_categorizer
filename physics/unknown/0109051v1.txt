Abstract  –  The  mixed  crystal  of  a  para-dibromobenzene  with  a  para-
chloronitrobenzene  is  investigated  at  concentration  of  components  from  0%  up  to 
60%  of  a  para-chloronitrobenzene  by  the  method  of  Low-Frequency  Raman 
spectroscopy. It is shown, that in range of concentrations from 25% up to 50% of a 
para-chloronitrobenzene the spectrum of the mixed crystal would consist of the sum 
of spectrums α and β phases which relation of intensities depends on concentration of 
components. It is also found, that the single crystal in this range has rod frame.

typical  example  of 

the 
molecular  mixed  crystal  having  an 
eutectic  is  the  solid  solution  of  a  para-
para-
dibromobenzene 
chloronitrobenzene [1]. This crystal has 
at

points 
para-
concentration 
and 
chloronitrobenzene  of  35.5% 
78.0%.  
 
Under  X-ray  diffraction  data 
[1,2]  in  range  of  concentrations  from 
0.0%  up 
to  28.0%  of  a  para-
chloronitrobenzene  the  α  phase  with 
frame of a pure para-dibromobenzene is 
located.  In  range  from  44.0%  up  to 
74.0%  the  solid  solution  crystallizes  in 
one  of  space  groups  C2/m,  C2  or  Cm 
(β phase).  Above  78.0%  there  is  a  γ 
phase  with 
para-
frame 
chloronitrobenzene.  All  three  phases 
have two molecules in a unit cell. 
 
 The  range  from  28.0%  up  to 
44.0%  of  a  para-chloronitrobenzene  is 
insufficiently studied.

Additional lines of small intensity 28.0, 
32.0  and  58.0  cm-1  apparently  are 
connected  to  translational  oscillations. 
Appearance  of  lines  with  frequencies 
72.0  and  83.0  cm-1  is  stipulated  by 
presence  of  imperfections  (vacancy, 
orientation  and  space  randomness  of 
molecules of components on the lattice 
of  the  mixed  crystal).  Padding  lines 
connected to presence β phases it is not 
found. In sections of a single crystal of 
a  solid  solution  at  this  concentration 
rod frame is also not found.

Abstract 

We investigate a simple variation of the series RLC circuit in which anti-parallel diodes 

replace the resistor.  This results in a damped harmonic oscillator with a nonlinear 

damping term that is maximal at zero current and decreases with an inverse current 

relation for currents far from zero.  A set of nonlinear differential equations for the 

oscillator circuit is derived and integrated numerically for comparison with circuit 

measurements. The agreement is very good for both the transient and steady-state 

responses. Unlike the standard RLC circuit, the behavior of this circuit is amplitude 

dependent.  In particular for the transient response the oscillator makes a transition from 

under-damped to over-damped behavior, and for the driven oscillator the resonance 

response becomes sharper and stronger as drive source amplitude increases.  The 

equipment is inexpensive and common to upper level physics labs.

I. Introduction 

The series RLC circuit is a standard example of a damped harmonic oscillator-one of the 

most important dynamical systems.  In this paper we investigate a simple variation of the 

2 

RLC circuit in which the resistor is replaced by two anti-parallel diodes.  This oscillator 

circuit is fundamental in the sense that it is constructed from a small number of the most 

basic passive electrical components: inductor, capacitor, and diodes.  The result is that 

oscillator characteristics that have no amplitude dependence for the standard RLC circuit 

have strong amplitude dependence for the oscillator presented here.  Transient response, 

voltage gain, resonant frequency, and sharpness of resonance exhibit threshold behavior 

due to the nonlinear current-voltage characteristics of the diodes.  We show that 

measured behavior agrees remarkably well with numerical prediction using standard 

circuit component models.     

 

 

The use of anti-parallel diodes creates a current-dependent damping term.  Section II 

shows that this oscillator is described by the homogeneous nonlinear differential 

equation:

Here x is the dimensionless current in the circuit, τ is dimensionless time, b0 is the 

familiar constant damping term and b1(x) is the current-dependent damping term. Thus 

damping is largest at the equilibrium position x = 0, and decreases inversely and 

symmetrically about it.  The nonlinearity of Eq. (1) is due solely to b1(x).  Our interest is 

3 

in the case when damping is dominated by b1(x). This term is shown to be responsible for 

the amplitude dependent behavior of the oscillator. 

Equation (1) is nonlinear, but when expressed as a system of first order equations is 

easily solved numerically using standard methods such as an adaptive Runge-Kutta. We 

compare these numerical predictions with experimental measurements for both the 

transient response and the steady-state response to a sinusoidal source.   

The circuit investigated here looks similar to the extensively studied chaotic oscillator 

constructed from a sinusoidal signal generator driving the series combination of a 

resistor, inductor, and diode.1-5  In those investigations interesting dynamics including 

chaos can occur when the reverse-recovery time of the diode is comparable to the 

circuit’s natural oscillation period.  For the circuit in this paper the reverse-recovery time 

is assumed to be zero since it is much shorter than the oscillation period.  In addition we 

include a capacitor so that the diode’s capacitance is negligible.  It is the voltage 

dependence of the diode’s dynamic resistance that causes interesting behavior.  

 

 

 

 

This oscillator circuit has analogy with the “eddy-current damped” pendulum, often used 

as a demonstration of Faraday’s and Lenz’s Laws.  In this demonstration a metal disk 

pendulum passes through the poles of a magnet placed at the bottom of the swing.  Thus 

the damping occurs near the equilibrium position x = 0 when the speed 

dx /

dt

 is highest.  

For the oscillator presented here this corresponds to maximum damping at zero current 

4 

and maximum voltage across the capacitor and inductor.  However the analogy does not 

extend to the mathematical form of the position dependence of the damping.   

The nonlinearly damped LC circuit using anti-parallel diodes is shown in Figure 1. 

Summing voltages around the circuit and then taking the time derivative gives the

where Vd is the voltage across the anti-parallel diodes. The resistor R accounts for the 

intrinsic resistance of the inductor in addition to any explicit resistor.  For the transient 

response the right hand side is zero. [In actual measurements a square wave source Vs

This system of equations is computed numerically using an adaptive Runge-Kutta 

method in Matlab.   

For circuit measurements of the transient response we use a square wave with frequency 

set low enough (∼ 1 Hz) so that each transition of the square wave gives a well-defined 

initial voltage V0 and final voltage Vf for the capacitor voltage. Thus for the numerical 

solution of the transient response VS(t) is Vf and the initial conditions are zero current and 

V0 for the capacitor voltage.   

For the steady state response VS(t) is a sinusoidal function.  Solutions are computed for 

different amplitudes and frequencies of source VS(t). The amplitude of the calculated 

capacitor voltage is recorded after the transient response has died off so that the solution 

has clearly achieved steady-state. The voltage gain A of the circuit is the ratio of the 

capacitor voltage amplitude to the source amplitude.  The results of the numerical 

computations are predictions for how the gain, the sharpness of the resonance, and the 

resonant frequency depend on the source amplitude.  

B.  Circuit Construction and Data Collection 

For the oscillator circuit we used a 2.5 mH inductor with an intrinsic resistance of 9 Ω, a 

0.010 µF capacitance, and two 1N4148 silicon diodes.  The resulting values for the 

dimensionless damping terms in Eq. (12) are b0 = 0.018 and bmax = 16600.  The diodes 

are characterized by m = 2 and I0 = 3 × 10-9 amp.  These values were obtained by 

measuring the diode’s current-voltage characteristics and fitting to Eq. (5).  They agree 

 

 

 

 

8 

well with previously measured values.8  This diode model was used for numerical 

predictions of all the experiments.  However it is known that Eq. (5) deviates from the 

measured I-V curve when used for both small and large currents.6  Therefore, for 

experiments involving large currents an additional numerical prediction was made that 

included a second set of parameters, m = 2.76 and I0 = 1.7 × 10-7 amps, for currents 

greater than 5 ma.  

The inductance and capacitance give a natural oscillation frequency of 31.8 kHz and 

corresponding period of about 30 µs.  This is much larger than the 1N4148’s reverse-

recovery time of less than 4 ns (from datasheet).  Thus the reverse-recovery time is 

assumed to be zero.  

The capacitance was comprised of 5 polypropylene nominal 0.002 µf capacitors in 

parallel.  As discussed later, this was done in order to minimize the effect of the 

capacitor’s equivalent series resistance (ESR).  Thus the total resistance in the circuit is 

attributed to the inductor’s intrinsic resistance of 9 Ω.      

The transient response is measured by using a source Vs with a low frequency (∼1 Hz) 

square wave, thus providing transitions between the two values of the square wave.  The 

quality of the square wave is important.  The transition should be complete in a time 

much shorter than the natural oscillation period of about 30 µs.  A square wave from a 

typical signal generator will not be able to drive the circuit due to the relatively high 

output impedance of the signal generator.  Therefore we run the signal generator to the 

 

 

 

 

9 

simple drive circuit shown in Fig. 3.  The result is a square wave with transitions 

completed within about 1 µs.  Generic op amps and small signal transistors are sufficient. 

If desired, a common slightly more complicated driver circuit that uses two conducting 

diodes to separate the transistor bases may be used to eliminate cross-over glitches.   

For the steady-state measurements the signal generator produced a sinusoidal voltage 

with the desired amplitude and frequency.  For investigations of how the maximum gain 

Amax depends on source amplitude, the frequency was adjusted to maximize the capacitor 

voltage for each source amplitude. This procedure also provided data for how the 

resonant frequency depends on source amplitude.  For investigations of the sharpness of 

the resonance response, the capacitor voltage was measured as a function of frequency at 

two source amplitudes.    

Data were collected on a Tektronix TDS 1002 digital oscilloscope.  A standard 10 MΩ 

oscilloscope probe attached to the capacitor will affect the circuit’s behavior.  This is 

because 10 MΩ is comparable to the dynamic resistance in Fig. 2 for small currents. 

Therefore the capacitor voltage was buffered by a unity gain FET input op amp (LF411 

for example) before measurement by the oscilloscope. 

C.  Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) 

It is important to consider the capacitor’s ESR.  Use of a general purpose ceramic disk 

capacitor without including its ESR will result in poor agreement between measurement 

 

 

 

 

10 

and prediction.  We chose to minimize the ESR by using a parallel combination of 5 

polypropylene capacitors.  The ESR of this combination appeared to be no more than 1Ω.  

Using a 0.01 µF ceramic disk capacitor instead of the polypropylene capacitors required 

adding 15 Ω to the inductor’s 9 Ω in order to get good agreement between measurement 

and numerical prediction. Thus the ESR of the ceramic capacitor is about 15 Ω.  It’s 

predicted ESR is obtained by using the dissipation factor from the capacitor data sheet 

stated as less than 0.03, and the formula for dissipation factor:9

DF

C
R
esr ω=

. 

 

 

 

(14) 

At the natural oscillation frequency of approximately 30 kHz, the predicted ESR for the 

0.01 µf ceramic capacitor is thus 16 Ω.  This compares well with our finding.   

IV.  Results and Discussion 

A.  Transient Response 

Figure 4 shows data and the numerical prediction for the transient response of the voltage 

across the capacitor. Agreement is remarkably good. The square wave source made a 

transition from 8.2 to 0 volts at time t = 0 sec. Thus the initial conditions used in the 

numerical solution of Eq. (13) were zero current and 8.2 volts across the capacitor.  

It is apparent that this oscillator makes a transition from under-damped to over-damped 

behavior when the amplitude (peak capacitor voltage) decreases below some threshold 

value.  In Fig. 4 the last zero crossing occurs at 0.075 ms.  For times after this the voltage 

11 

reaches a maximum, then undergoes monotonic decay characteristic of an over-damped 

oscillator.   

The transition from under-damped to over-damped behavior may be understood by 

considering the transient response oscillation frequency for a standard RLC circuit: 

ω

=

⎝

(standard RLC). 

 

(15) 

For a fixed value of R the frequency is constant so there is no transition from under-

damped to over-damped behavior for the standard RLC circuit.  However for the anti-

parallel diodes the resistance depends on the current as shown in Fig. 2.  If R represents 

an effective resistance during a complete oscillation, then Eq. (15) does predict 

dependence of ω on oscillation amplitude.  As the amplitude decreases, the current 

spends more time near small values where the dynamic resistance of the anti-parallel 

diodes is large, causing the effective resistance to increase.  Eventually the effective 

resistance is large enough so that ω becomes imaginary, corresponding to the transition to 

over-damped decay.  The concept of an effective resistance is useful for understanding 

the observed behavior, however it is not intended as a calculation tool.  

 

 

 

The square wave’s value of zero volts [used for Vs(t) in Eq. (13)] is not reached during 

the time shown in Fig. 4.  This is due to the large dynamic resistance of the diodes at 

small currents.  The RC time constant for small currents is (

Previously we showed that the voltage on a capacitor discharging through a diode has a 

nearly logarithmic decay.8  As a result it takes about 0.5 s for the 0.01 µf capacitor to be 

 

 

 

12 

essentially discharged.  This necessitated the use of a low frequency (∼ 1 Hz) square 

wave, thereby allowing the transient response to die out before the next transition of the 

square wave.     

B.  Steady state response 

The characteristics of interest for the steady-state driven oscillator are the voltage gain A, 

the resonant frequency, and the sharpness of the resonance.  Here we show how these 

characteristics for the anti-parallel diodes-LC oscillator depend on the amplitude of the 

driving source.  In contrast, the standard RLC circuit is independent of source amplitude 

for these characteristics. As in the previous section, we will use the standard RLC results 

and the concept of an effective resistance to understand the amplitude dependent behavior 

of the anti-parallel diodes-LC circuit.      

Figures 5 and 6 show results for how the maximum gain Amax and the resonance 

frequency ωres depend on source amplitude.  In both graphs numerical predictions are 

shown by lines and results from circuit measurements by circles.  To understand the 

variation of Amax and ωres with source amplitude consider the theoretical voltage gain A 

for a standard RLC circuit:

  (standard RLC).  

(18) 

Clearly Amax and ωres do not depend on source amplitude for the standard RLC circuit.  

However if R represents an effective resistance of the anti-parallel diodes, then Eqs. (17) 

and (18) do predict dependence on source amplitude.  Small source amplitudes result in 

small currents which according to Fig. 2 have the largest resistance, whereas for large 

source amplitudes part of the cycle has large currents where the dynamic resistance drops 

inversely with current resulting in a decreased effective resistance. Thus Eq. (18) predicts 

the behavior seen in Fig. 5, Amax increases with amplitude.   In Figure 6 the resonant 

frequency increases with source amplitude, leveling off at 31.8 kHz, the frequency 

predicted for undamped oscillation using the values C = 0.01 µF and L = 2.5 mH.  This 

behavior is predicted by Eq. (17).  Equation (17) also predicts existence of the cut-off 

amplitude seen in Fig. 6 below which the effective resistance is large enough so the 

frequency becomes imaginary.  This corresponds to the transition of the circuit to a low 

pass filter and therefore peak response at ω = 0.  

 

 

Figure 5 shows three different numerical predictions.  The solid line is the prediction 

using the single parameter set for the diode I-V characteristics as described in Section III.  

The discrepancy between this prediction and the experimental result is accounted for by 

two effects; deviation from ideal diode behavior given by Eq. (5), and the ESR of the 

capacitance.  The dashed line is the prediction when an additional set of diode parameters 

was included for high currents as described in Section III.  Furthermore, inclusion of 1 Ω 

 

 

 

 

14 

for the capacitor ESR and other unaccounted for distributed resistance brings the 

numerically predicted ratios (dot-dashed line) in agreement with the measured results.    

Note that the transient response in Fig. 4 showed little discrepancy between numerical 

prediction and measurement.  This is because the largest amplitude of capacitor voltage 

was about 8 volts, which in Fig. 5 is achieved with source amplitude of about 1.1 volts.  

The discrepancy is small for source amplitudes below this value. 

Figure 7 shows the resonance response of the voltage gain for two different source 

amplitudes, 0.9 (lower curves) and 1.2 (upper curves) volts.  Numerically predicted gains 

are solid lines and measured gains are symbols.  The 1.2 volt numerical predictions used 

the 2-part parameterization for the diodes corresponding to the dashed line prediction in 

Fig. 5.   

The general shape of these curves is that of Eq. (16) for different R.  The sharpness of the 

response clearly depends on the source amplitude.  The 1.2 volt source amplitude 

produces a much taller and narrower peak than the 0.9 volt source.  This is due to the 

lower effective resistance of the diodes for the larger amplitude currents.  In contrast the 

standard RLC circuit has the same shape resonance peak for all source amplitudes.  Also 

the resonance curve in Fig. 7 is narrower for a given maximum gain than the 

corresponding curve for a standard RLC circuit.  This is because as the frequency moves 

away from resonance, the current amplitude through the diodes drops causing the 

effective resistance to increase.  Equation (16) shows that increasing R is an additional 

 

 

 

 

15 

contribution to reducing A. The voltage gain peak disappears when the source amplitude 

is reduced to about 0.8 volts.  For smaller amplitudes the graph is that of a low pass filter.        

It is worth noting the counter-intuitive result that Eq. (17) is mathematically different 

from Eq. (15), the natural oscillation frequency for the transient response of the 

homogeneous equation.  Confusion between these formulas is an easy source of error.  

V. Conclusion 

We have shown that the fundamental electronic oscillator obtained by replacing the 

resistor in a series RLC circuit by anti-parallel diodes has interesting amplitude-

dependent behavior not exhibited by the RLC circuit.  In particular the transient response 

displays a transition from under-damped to over-damped behavior, and for the driven 

oscillator there is threshold behavior in which the resonance response gets sharper and 

stronger as the source amplitude increases.  The differential equations derived for this 

nonlinearly damped harmonic oscillator are easily solved numerically.  Numerical 

predictions agree remarkably well with measured behavior.

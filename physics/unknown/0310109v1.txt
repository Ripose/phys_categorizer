Abstract 

Generalized  wall-functions  in  application  to  high-Reynolds-number  turbulence 

models are derived. The wall-functions are based on transfer of a boundary condition 

from a wall to some intermediate boundary near the wall (usually the first nearest to a 

wall  mesh  point  but  that  is  not  obligatory).  The  boundary  conditions  on  the 

intermediate  boundary  are  of  Robin-type  and  represented  in  a  differential  form.  The 

wall-functions are obtained in an analytical easy-to-implement form, take into account 

source terms such as pressure gradient and buoyancy forces, and do not include free 

parameters.  The  log-profile  assumption  is  not  used  in  this  approach.  Both  Dirichlet 

and Newman boundary-value problems are considered. A method for complementing 

solution near a wall is suggested. Although the generalized wall-functions are realized 

for  the  k-ε  model,  generalization  to  other  turbulence  models  looks  quite  clear.  The 

general  approach  suggested  is  applicable  to  studying  high-temperature  regimes  with 

variable laminar viscosity and density. A robust numerical algorithm is proposed for 

implementation  of  Robin-type  wall-functions.  Preliminary  test  results  made  for  a 

channel  flow  showed  good  accuracy  and  a  weak  dependence  of  the  solution  on  the 

location of the intermediate boundary where the boundary conditions are set.  

 

 

 

1. Introduction 

The  problem  of  mathematical  simulation  of  turbulent  flows  near  walls  appears  in 

many practical applications. It is well known that turbulence vanishes near a wall due 

to the no-slip boundary condition for the velocity as well as the blocking effect caused 

by  the  wall.  In  the  vicinity  of  the  wall,  there  is  a  thin  sublayer  with  predominantly 

molecular diffusion. The sublayer has a substantial influence upon the remaining part 

of the flow. An adequate numerical resolution of a solution in the sublayer requires a 

very  fine  mesh  because  of  sublayer  thinness  and  high  gradients  of  the  solution.  It 

makes a model used time consuming and often not suitable for industrial applications. 

Because of low velocities in the sublayer, models that resolve the sublayer are called 

low-Reynolds-number (LR) models.  

 

To  avoid  direct  resolution  of  the  viscous  sublayer,  so-called  high-Reynolds-

number  (HR)  models  have  been  developed.  In  this  type  of  models  the  sublayer 

domain  is  not  directly  resolved.    It  significantly  saves  computational  efforts    [1].  In 

the HR models, the boundary conditions or near-wall profiles are represented by wall-

functions. In most cases, the wall-functions are semi-empirical and have very limited 

applications  [1-5].    First  wall-functions  are  based  on  the  log-law  profile  for  the 

velocity [4, 5]. The main disadvantage of these wall-functions is a strong dependence 

on  the  location  of  the  mesh  point  closest  to  a  wall  where  the  wall-functions  are 

applied.  Such  a  problem  is  especially  pronounced  if  the  first  mesh  point  is  located 

inside  the  viscous  sublayer.  To  avoid  this,  the  scalable  wall-function  approach  is 

suggested in [6]. Wilcox showed [7] that pressure gradient must be taken into account 

to  avoid  the  mesh  dependence.  In  more  recent  approaches  [1-3]  attempts  have  been 

made  to  take  into  account  the  pressure  gradient  and  other  effects  such  as  buoyancy 

forces.  Numerical  comparisons  done  in  [1-3]  showed  that  such  advanced  wall-

functions give substantially better prediction than the standard wall-functions. A brief 

review of different wall-functions used can be found in, e.g., [1]. Sub-grid numerical 

wall-functions  are  developed  in  [2]  where  dependent  variables  are  determined  by 

solving  boundary-layer-type  transport  equations  in  a  near-wall  sub-grid.  In  this 

approach,  the  boundary  condition  on  the  boundary  that  is  external  to  the  wall  is 

determined  by  linear  interpolation  of  certain  main-grid  values.  In  [3],  the  analytical 

wall-functions  are  evolved  by  integrating  boundary-layer-type  equations  in  the 

vicinity  of a wall using the  assumption  that  all terms besides the dissipative one are 

constant. Mainly, it means that the contribution of the convective terms is neglected 

near  the  wall  and  the  pressure  gradient  and  buoyancy  force  (if  applicable)  are  not 

changed. At the  wall, the  boundary conditions are the same as those used in the LR 

models.  The  analytical  profiles  are  then  used  in  the  cell  nearest  to  the  wall  to 

reconstruct the near-wall solution. The wall-functions for the turbulent kinetic energy 

and  its  dissipation  are  based  on  a  local  approximation  in  the  near-wall  cell  and 

assumption  on  the  local  equilibrium.  Although  approaches  [1-3]  allows  one  make 

substantially better prediction in comparison to the standard methods, the realization 

of them is quite complicated especially in case of their implementation into industrial 

codes.  The  wall-functions  [1-3]  can  be  represented  in  a  finite-difference  form  only. 

Although  this  form  is  suitable  for  finite-volume  algorithms,  its  use  for  finite-

difference approximations is not clear. As the standard wall-functions, this approach 

faces substantial problems if the nearest to a wall cell is in the viscous sublayer. Also, 

it  is  important  to  note  that  the  second  to  the  wall  cell  can  not  be  much  smaller  or 

bigger than the first one because of integration over the first cell used.  

 

In  the  following  sections,  the  method  of  boundary  condition  transfer  is  used 

[8].  The  method  allows  us  to  transfer  a  boundary  condition  from  a  wall  to  some 

intermediate  surface.  It  will  be  showed  that  it  is  possible  to  transfer  a  boundary 

condition  either  approximately  (analytically)  or  exactly  (numerically).  The  boundary 

conditions on the intermediate surface are always of Robin-type and represented in a 

differential  form.  They  can  take  into  account  the  influence  of  the  source  terms  in 

governing  equations.  These  boundary  conditions  are  interpreted as generalized wall-

functions. The location of the point, where the boundary conditions transfer to, does 

not  make  any  considerable  influence  on  a  mesh  distribution  nearby  this  point.  The 

wall-functions  can  easy  be  used  especially  in  finite-difference  approximations.  A 

method  for  complementing  the  solution  on  the  entire  domain  outside  the  viscous 

sublayer is suggested.  

Numerical  intermediate  Robin-type  boundary  conditions  are  developed along 

with  a  decomposition  method.  The  method  allows  us  to  split  the  boundary-value 

problem into two parts: an inner near-wall (internal) problem and an outer (external) 

one.  Both  boundary-value  problems  can  be  solved  independently,  using  different 

numerical schemes and meshes, which yields the terminal solution. The inner solution 

can  be  then  used  for  complementing  the  solution  near  the  wall  if  HR  models  are 

applied along with the generalized wall-functions.  

The  general  approach  suggested  is  applicable  to  studying  high-temperature 

turbulent flows with variable density and laminar viscosity.  

 

 

 

2. Model equation  

First, considering the following model equation: 

 ((cid:181)uy)y = Rh,                                                      (1) 

 
defined in a domain Ω = [0, ye] with Dirichlet boundary conditions:  

u(0) = u0,  u(ye) = u1                                                  (2) 

 

Assuming  that  Rh  =  const,  after  integrating  equation  (1)  from  0  to  y,  one 

                                                τw   = µ(y)du/dy(y) - Rh y ,                                           (3) 

where τw = µ(y)du/dy(y)w. Index w here and below means a value at y = 0. The second

Relation (5) can be considered as a Robin-type boundary condition transferred from a 

wall  (y  =  0)  to  some  point  y*  inside  the  domain  Ω. This boundary condition can  be 

either exact (if the exact function of µ is used in (6)) or approximate (if µ is estimated 

by one way or another).

In a more general case, it is not difficult to take into account variation of the 

coefficient µ in the interval [0, yv] as in [3].  

Once a Newman problem is solved: 

du/dy(0) = τw/µw,  u(ye) = u1 ,                                                 (10)

The boundary conditions are always linear if governing equation (1) is linear. 

They  are  represented  in  a  differential-integral  form  which  can  be  easy  realized 

especially  with  finite-difference  approximations.  It  is  easy  to  see  that  mesh 
distribution possible in the interval [y*, ye] can be independent of the location of the 
intermediate boundary corresponding to the point y*.  

In application to the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations (RANS), the 

method of boundary condition transfer considered here gives generalized Robin-type 

wall-functions. 

3. Generalized wall functions  

 
We  apply  the  method  of  boundary  condition  transfer  given  above  to  derive  the 

generalized wall-functions for the tangential velocity component U or temperature T , 

and the turbulent kinetic energy k.  

Neglecting diffusion parallel to a wall, the momentum and enthalpy transport 

equations can be written in the Cartesian coordinate system (x, y) as follows:

    (13)  

 
Here  µl  and  µt  are  the  laminar  and  turbulent  viscosities,  accordingly; Pr and Prt are 

Prandtl numbers; U and V are the velocity component in the (x, y) coordinate system; 
ρ is the density; P is the pressure; β(T)g is the term representing the buoyancy effect 

if applicable.  

 

Both  equations  have  the  same  form  as  model  equation  (1)  where  the  right-

hand side Rh equals either

Then, the intermediate boundary conditions for U and T at point y* are given 

by  (7)  upon  substitution  either  U  or  T  instead  of  u  accordingly.  Evidently,  the 
coefficient  µ  must  be  considered  as  either  µl    +  µt  or  µl/Pr    +  µt/Prt.  In  case  of  the 
momentum equation   u0 = 0. If y* is chosen in the vicinity of the wall, the right-hand 

side Rh can be represented by a constant neglecting the terms with y-derivatives and 
taking  the  terms  with  x-derivatives  at  y*,  as  it  is  made  in  [3].  Thus,  in  case  of  the 

enthalpy and momentum equations the relative right-hand sides are as follows: 

Rh = Rht ≡ ρUdT/dx(y*),                                                       (14) 

Rh = Rhu ≡ρUdU/dx(y*) +  dP/dx(y*) + β(T(y* ))                                (15) 

Unlike  [3],  a  similar  approach  is  applied  to  the  equation  for  the  turbulence 

kinetic energy as well:

If  y*  <  yv  then  the  boundary  conditions  are  set  inside  the  sublayer,  and 

formulas  (9)  are  not  valid.  The  consideration  of  the  boundary  conditions  (7),  (8) 

inside  the  sublayer  is  not  appropriate  because  the  model  used  does  not  take  into 

account  the  blocking  wall  effects  adequately.  It  is  suggested  to  pose  the  boundary 

conditions  at  the  edge  of  the  sublayer  y  =  yv  as  in  [6]  because  yv  is  small  enough. 

Then, the coefficients f1 and f2  in (7) can be evaluated as follows:

It  is  assumed  that  the  turbulent  viscosity  µt  reaches  value  (21)  at  the  edge  of  the 

viscous  sublayer  immediately.  These  boundary  conditions  are  consistent  with 

boundary conditions (9) taking in the limit  *

  Dependence  (24)  assumes  a  variation  of  ε  in  the 

viscous sublayer because yd ≈ 0.5yv.  

 

The  wall-function  for  the  turbulent  energy  k  is  used  in  form  (7),  (8)  and 

depends  on  the  right-hand  side  Rhk(y)  represented  by  equality  (17).  It  includes  the 
dissipation ε and derivative dU/dy. The former term is taken from (24) while the last 
term is evaluated in the interval [0, y*] from the momentum equation:

In (25), the turbulent viscosity µt is defined by (18).  

Thus, the coefficients f1 and f2 in the wall-functions (5)-(9) depend on y* and 
k* only. The latter value is determined from solution of the HR model at the boundary 
point  y*.  Hence,  the  intermediate  boundary  conditions  (7)  at  y  =  y*  complete  the 
boundary-value  problem  in  the  interval  [y*,  ye]  (ye  is  the  external  boundary  of  the 

computational  domain)  and  can  be  considered  as  generalized  wall-functions.  These 

boundary conditions are of Robin-type and similar to the (cid:147)slip boundary condition(cid:148) at 

the  edge  of  the  Knudsen-layer  in  aerodynamics.  It  is  important  to  note  that  the 

boundary conditions are linear with respect to the leading variable. As it follows from 

(5)  and  (7),  the  source  terms  in  the  wall-functions  can  only  be  essential  far  enough 
from a wall because of the quadratic term in y*.  

We note that, although the problem is solved in the bulk domain [y*, ye] only, 

the flux to the wall (e.g., skin friction) can be easy evaluated considering (25) (or its 

analogy for the temperature in case of heat flux) at y = 0.  

Upon obtaining a HR solution, it can be extended to the interval [yv y*] using 

the analytical solution if

It  means  that the intermediate boundary is not obligatory to be related to the 
nearest  to  the  wall  cell.  It  is  possible  to  take  y*  far  enough  from  the  wall  and 

complement the solution on the region to the sublayer by (26).  

If a heat transfer problem is considered, where buoyancy force is important, it 

is  not  difficult  to  take  into  account  variable  function  β(T(y)).  In  this  case,  the 

analytical solution (26) for the temperature (if 

) is substituted to the right-

hand side Rh for the momentum equation. Since Rh is variable, the wall-functions for 
the velocity are used in form (7), (8). If y* is in the sublayer, then β can be sufficiently 

evaluated by the value β(Tw). Also, dependence 

µ µ=

l

l T
( )

can be taken into account 

using either linear or quadratic approximation, as in [3], and easily implemented.  

The generalized wall-functions obtained and their realization are not based on 
a numerical integration in the inner region [0, y*], as in [1-3], therefore the location of 

the  intermediate  boundary  is  very  substantial  for  mesh  distribution  in  the  bulk 
domain. It means we can choose, e.g., a fine mesh despite a relatively big value y*  (or 

vice versa) without loose of stability.   

 

 

 

4. Numerical solution 

In numerical simulation of turbulence, numerical schemes, which reserve positiveness 

of  a  solution,  are  very  efficient  because  unknown  variables  such  as  the  turbulent 
kinetic  energy  k  or  its  dissipation  ε  must  be  positive.  The  following  numerical 

procedure  has  been  developed  for  using  the  positive  type  schemes  in  solving 

boundary-value problems with Robin-type boundary conditions. 

Boundary condition (7) can be rewritten in the following general form:

+

β

 

,                                                 (27)

 

assuming that both function k and its derivative dk/dx are positive. This assumption is 

valid in case of real physical problems for the turbulent kinetic energy in the vicinity 
of a wall. The coefficient α is positive because f1 is always positive but the coefficient 
β can be negative. In computations it can lead to a negative value of k. To avoid such 

a case, it is suggested to rewrite (27) in the following form if β < 0:

For stability, near the points, where β changes its sign, a relaxation procedure 

 
for the coefficients α and β has been used.       

5. Decomposition method  

In  this  section  a  decomposition  method  for  solving  equations  in  the  LR  models  is 

derived. The main idea is given below for an arbitrary linear differential equation. 

First, considering a linear Dirichlet problem in the interval [0, ye]: 

                                  

                                      Lu = f                                                                             (29) 

                                           u(0) = u0,           u(ye) = u1 . 
 
The entire computational domain Ω = [0, ye] is decomposed by two sub-domains, an 
inner one Ω1 = [0, y*] and outer one Ω2 = [y*, ye], where y* < ye.  

Near  the  wall  (in  the  inner  domain  Ω1),  the  following  two  boundary-value 

problems are solved: 

  Lu1 = f,     u1(0) = u0, du1/dy (y* ) = 0            0 ≤  y ≤  y*,                                 (30) 

     Lu2 = 0,      u2(0) = 0,   du2/dy(y*) = 1          0 ≤  y ≤  y* .                                 (31) 

It is easy to prove that the general solution to (29) on the inner domain Ω1 is 

            u(y) = u1(y) + du/dy(y*)u2(y)                                          (32) 

or 

 

 

 

 

    

 du/dy(0) = u0,                 u(ye) = u1                                             (34)                    

If we consider (32) at the point y*, we have a Robin-type boundary condition for 

the outer domain Ω2:  

 

 u(y*) = u1(y*) + du/dy(y*) u2(y*)                                      (33) 

 
This  boundary  condition  is  exact  if  we  set  it  at  y  =  y*.  Thus,  the  boundary 

condition from the wall (y = 0) is transferred to the point y*.  

The problem on one domain Ω is split into two problems on the domains Ω1 and 

Ω2. As a result, we have some version of a decomposition method.  

In case of Newman boundary conditions  

 

 

 

 
 
 

the  algorithm  is  similar  to  that  for  the  Dirichlet  problem  (29).  Indeed,  we  solve  the 

following two boundary-value problems: 

Lu1 = f,    du1dy(0) = u0,    u1(y* ) = 0,                                                         (35) 

     Lu2 = 0,    du2/dy(0) = 0,     u2(y*) = 1.                                                         (36) 

The general solution to problem (34) on the inner domain Ω1 is 

            u(y) = u1(y) + u(y* )u2(y)                                                       (37) 

 
  After derivation, a Robin-type boundary condition at y* is obtained: 
 

            du/dy(y*) = du1/dy(y*) + u(y*)du2/dy(y*)                                           (38) 

 
After solution to problems (35) and (36), we use this boundary condition in the outer 
domain Ω2. In the inner domain Ω1, the solution to problem (34) is then obtained from 
(37), since u(y*) is known from the outer problem on Ω2. 

 

In  case  of  nonlinear  equations,  the  decomposition  procedure  given  above  is 

used in nonlinear iterations. 

Thus,  the  decomposition  method  described  above  allows  us  to  split  the 

problem  into  the  two  parts:  the  near-wall  (including  the  viscous  sublayer)  problem 

and the outer one. At a first glance, we gain nothing obtaining three boundary-value 

problems  instead  of  one.  On  the  other  hand,  in  the  inner  (near-wall)  and  outer 

domains the appropriate problems can be solved on different meshes using different 

approximations. The analysis of LR models shows that the behaviour of the solution 

in  the  vicinity  of  the  sublayer  defers  drastically  from  that  in  the  rest  bulk  domain, 

therefore  such  a  splitting  can  be  useful.  It  is  important  to  note  that  in  uniform 

approaches (one domain only) the presence of two adjacent cells having substantially 

different sizes can lead to a loss of accuracy or even stability. Additionally, one can 

note  that  the  algorithms  on  solving  the  inner  and  outer  problems  can  be  easily 

parallelized.  

 
Since the functions u1(y) and u2(y) do not explicitly depend on the solution in 
the  domain  Ω2  (the  dependence  is  via  the  coefficients  only),  these  functions  can  be 

calculated once and then used further along with the use of either HR or LR model in 
an external domain (similar to Ω2). In this approach, the problem is only solved in the 

external domain, and the solution is complemented on the entire domain then by the 

following way:

. It guarantees a smooth junction

To determine approximate (cid:147)basic(cid:148) functions u1 and u2, the coefficients in the 

relative problems can be evaluated using Reichardt(cid:146)s profiles for all the variables u, k 
and ε based on some estimation for uτ.    

This  method  can  be  effective  if  similar  boundary-value  problems  are 

considered. For instance, if an initial-boundary value 2D problem is studied, we solve 

a  boundary  value  problem  in  one  direction  x  and  an  initial  problem  in  another 

direction  y.  It  is  possible  to  calculate  the  (cid:147)basic(cid:148)  functions  u1  and  u2  once  at  some 

point x0 and use them for approximate complementing the solution further at the next 

The decomposition approach, as well as the wall-functions developed, can be easy 

generalized and used for the problems with variable viscosity and density.

6. Test case  

A channel fully developed plane flow has been conducted as a test case. The flow is 

simulated  far  enough  from  the  edge  of  the  channel,  so  that  the  problem  can  be 

considered  as  1D  [9].  The  standard  HR  k-ε  model  has  been  used  to  test  the  wall-

Here y is the distance to the wall, px is the pressure gradient in the channel which is 

assumed to be negative, and ν = (cid:181)/ ρ.

where

 is the friction velocity, h is the half of the channel height. The 

dependence  of  dimensionless  velocity,  u+  =  U/uτ,  on  the  universal  coordinate,  y+  = 

yuτ/ν,  will  be  calculated  using  the  approach  developed  in  this  work  and  compared 

against the benchmark results.  

As  it  follows  from  Section  4,  the  generalized  wall-functions  have  only  one 
parameter which is the coordinate y* of the point where the boundary conditions are 
moved  to.  In  this  work,  calculations  have  been  done  for  different  values  of  y* 

including those less than yv (in the viscous sublayer). In Figure 1 the velocity profiles 
u+  obtained  by  the  wall-function  approach  are  given  against  y+  =  yuτ/ν  for  different 
values of y*. The profiles are compared against Reichardt(cid:146)s profile [10] representing 

the benchmark solution.   

In Figure 1 the velocity profile is given for y+* 

≡

= 1; 5; 10. Although y* 

*y uτ
ν

is deeply in the viscous sublayer the correspondence to the LR solution (Reichardt(cid:146)s 
profile) is quite reasonable. The maximal difference falls at the case y+* = 10 when 
the point y* is nearby (but outside) the sublayer. A slight difference between the first 
two curves (y+* equals 1 and 5) is explained by different boundary conditions for ε.  

If  y*  is  outside  the  sublayer,  the  prediction  is  better.  It  is  shown  by  Figure  2 
where y+* = 30; 50; 100; 200. Even, if y* is taken far from the viscous sublayer, the 
solution is quite close to the benchmark solution. In the last case (y* = 200) a half of 

the domain is excluded in the case of the HR model; nevertheless, in the bulk (rest) 

domain the solution is quite sensible. 

Fig. 1. Velocity profile in channel flow. Solid line is Reichardt(cid:146)s profile; the other  
            lines correspond to y+* = 1; 5; 10.  
 
In all range of y* considered (1 ≤ y+* ≤ 200) the difference in u+ predicted by 

the LR profile and HR models is within 15%.  

Fig. 2. Velocity profile in channel flow. Solid line is Reichardt(cid:146)s profile; the other 
            lines correspond to y+* = 30; 50; 100; 200.  
 

 

 

 

A  comparison  between  several  different  kinds  of  wall-functions  is  shown  in 
Figure  3  for  y+*  =  100.    The  dashed line corresponds to the homogeneous boundary 

conditions where the right-hand side is not taken into account. In this case, f2 = 0 in 

either (5) or (7). The error is big enough; that confirms the importance of taking into 
consideration the source terms in the wall-functions in the case of big values of y*. If 

the  source  term  is  included  in  the  boundary  conditions  for  the  velocity  only,  the 

prediction then becomes much more accurate (dash-dotted line). At the same time, the 

replacement  of  the  boundary  condition  (7)  for  the  turbulent  kinetic  energy  k  by  a 

frequently used boundary condition 

k =
 

23/1 
τu

 gives a substantial deviation from the 

benchmark solution (dotted line). The standard wall-functions for all variables [9]

results in much better prediction (dash-double-dotted line). Nevertheless, one can note 

that the channel flow is one of the most convenient test cases for the standard wall-

functions.  The  current  approach  gives  more  accurate  prediction,  shown  in  Figure  2, 

although  the  main  advantages  of  the  wall-functions  developed  can  be  expected  at 

consideration of more complicated cases. It is important to emphasise that in contrast 

to the standard wall-functions the approach suggested is not based on the assumption 

on the velocity log-profile or any similar additional information to match the solution. 

Also, we note that the standard wall-functions include the friction velocity uτ, which 

is uknown in advance in a general case, that makes the boundary conditions nonlinear 

and demands appropriate iterations for resolving.  

The  decomposition  method  described  in  Section  5  has  been  tested  using  the 

low-Reynolds number model by Chien [11]:

Reichardt(cid:146)s  profile;  the  other      lines  correspond  to  homogeneous  wall-

In Figure 4 the dashed and dotted lines represent the solution obtained by the 
decomposition  method  with  the  junction  point  at  y+*  =  100.  In each sub-domain Ω1 
and Ω2 a uniform mesh with 20 points is used. For comparison, the dashed-dotted line 

corresponding  to  1-block  solution  obtained  on  a  mesh  with  40  points  is  given.  The 

deviation  from  Reichardt(cid:146)s  profile  is  explained  by  a  very  coarse  mesh  (in  case  of  a 

fine mesh the prediction is much more accurate). The HR solution complemented on 

the  whole  domain  by  LR  solution  (39)  is  shown  by  the  curves  with  circles  and 
diamonds. The complemented part of this solution on the interval [0 y+*] is given in 

Figure  5    (dashed  line).  The  curves  marked  by  squares  and  triangles  represent  the 

(cid:147)basic(cid:148)  near-wall  solutions  u1  and  u2  used  in  (39).  The  dotted  line    is  the  analytical 

solution (26).

7.  Conclusion 

Generalized  wall-functions  have  been  developed.  They  are  based  on  transfer  of 

boundary conditions from a wall to some point in the computational domain (usually 

the nearest to the wall grid point). The boundary conditions at this point are of Robin-

type and represented in a differential form. These boundary conditions are interpreted 

as  generalized  wall-functions  taking  into  account  source  terms  and  used  for  HR 

models.  The  wall-functions  have  been  obtained  in  a  compact  easy-to-implement 

analytical  form  and  they  do  not  include  any  adjustable  parameters.  Testing  this 

approach along with the k-ε equations applied to a fully developed turbulent flow in a 

channel  showed  that  the  proposed  wall-functions  are  quite  accurate  even  if  the 

boundary  conditions  are  set  at  a  point  either  in  a  viscous  sublayer  or  far  beyond.  A 

numerical  robust  approach  preserving  positivity  of  a  solution  in  the  case  of  Robin-

type  boundary  conditions  has  been  developed.  Mesh  distribution  inside  the 

computational domain can be chosen independently of the location of the intermediate 

boundary.  

In  application  to  LR  models  a  decomposition  method  has  been  suggested.  It 

allows  us  to  split  the  problem  into  a  near-wall part and the rest one. The boundary-

value  problems  in  both  parts  can  be  solved  independently  using  different  numerical 

schemes and meshes. The near-wall part of the solution can be used for approximate 

complementing the solution obtained by the wall-functions and HR model near a wall 

on  the  entire  domain  including  a  near-wall  part.  This  opportunity  requires  an 

additional  investigation  on  the  base  of  consideration  of  multidimensional  problems. 

The  decomposition  approach,  as  well  as  the  wall-functions  proposed,  can  be  easy 

generalized and used for the problems with variable viscosity and density. 

The generalized wall-functions suggested performed well in a 1D test problem on 

channel fully turbulent flow. The wall-functions can be relatively easy extended on a 

multidimensional  case.  In  the  future,  a  quantitative  study  for  such  problems  is 

expected.

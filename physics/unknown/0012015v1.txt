It  is  shown  that  (special)  relativistically  dilated  time  is  the  vector  sum  of  rest
time and time induced by movement in three dimensional space exeeding the
rest time component and that the first vector is orthogonally directed relative to
our  three  dimensional  space.  This  again  implies  that  its  origin  lies  in  the
movement of three dimensional space relative to a four dimensional manifold.
The theory predicts asymmetrical time dilation.

Key  words:  Special  relativity  -  time  -  vector  sum  -  direction  of  rest-time  vector  -
asymmetrical time dilation

It has been shown in [1] that translational velocity is symmetrically composite and the
resulting space-time geometry Gaussian. Accordingly the Lorentz factor (cid:11)  = 
(1 - v /c )

((cid:7)  = v dt’/(cdt) and dt’ = dt(cid:11) ). Furthermore, in the same study has been demonstrated
Einstein’s  “relativity  of  simultaneity”  and  the  “FitzGerald-Lorentz  contraction”  be
erroneous derivations of the Lorentz transformation. Instead the correct interpretation
of the latter predicts a relativistic expansion of length or volume by the factor (cid:11)  and
the  simultaneity  of  events,  but  dilated  by  the  same  factor.  The  well-known  rise  of
interaction-radii  of  hadrons  in  high  energetic  collisions  and  related  experimental
phenomena are due to this relativistic expansion of volume - as has been extensively
shown.  Therefrom  directly  follows  m   =  dt ’v /c  =  dt (cid:11) v /c,  where  dt   =  dx/c,  which
x
means that relativistic mass is solely induced by the factor dt ’v /c of the expanded
volume  V’  =  dx’dy’dz’  of  a  moving  body  and,  furthermore,  the  existence  of  a
fundamental length (cid:27)  = c-  = (cid:8)h and a quantum of time - .
 
Because the space-like vector dt’ v /c and rest time dt  are of the same origin [2] the

latter must beyond its character as a “time-like vector” be a genuine, directionally well
defined vector (dt ), too, implying relativistically dilated time to be the vector sum:

or, especially,

Thus, time in the moving frame is the vector sum of the rest time in the frame of the
observer and the space-like vector dt’ v /c directed into any of the dimensions of three
dimensional space. From (1) follows that dt’ v /c is based orthogonally onto the vector
dt  (dt’ v /c ] dt ) so that the absolute value of modulus of the vector dt’  and the
vector -- ', respectively, is

Let us assume that the absolute value of modulus according to (3) is really associated

with  a  higher  velocity  of  the  moving  frame  relative  to  space  and,  therewith,  to  the
observer’s rest frame so that is valid

Because  of  the  absolute  symmetry  of  both  frames  according  to  the  principle  of
relativity a Lorentz transformation in either frame (dt’  = dt(cid:11)  and dt  = dt’ (cid:11) ) results in:

This result is in accord with the well-known flight-time experiments with airplanes [4]
and muons [5], [6]. Therefore, the twin paradox of special relativity is resolved to the
result  that  time  dilation  is  asymmetrically  dependent  on  velocity  relative  to  the
microwave background (this result has been independently derived in [3]). 
In conventional special relativity the above result is achieved by an one-sided Lorentz
transformation from the moving to the resting frame. But that theory predicts the same
result  if  the  observer’s  rest  frame  is  assumed  to  be  the  moving  one  -  contrary  to
experiment.  Although  this  is  frequently  denied  is  in  the  framework  of  conventional
special relativity another conclusion absolutely not possible because it only admits of
relative and denies absolute motion. Thus, to be in accord with experimentally verified
asymmetric  time  dilation  the  conventional  interpretation  in  reality  tacitly  involves
absolute motion. 
 
In the case of collision experiments a contradiction to special relativity does not arise,
because the quantized inertial motion between any two frames of reference is applied
to  a  preferred  natural  rest  frame  (   implying  their  absolute  symmetry  and  equality
relative to (  [1] - which again is moving relative to space (micro wave background).
This will be deduced by every observer in every frame. On the other hand the different
velocity of the frames under consideration relative to space and, therewith, different
absolute values of modulus of dt’  and -- ' acccording to (3) must be real. Hence, the
latter vectors always result from two successive Lorentz transformations so that in the
case of parallel and antiparallel motion, respectively, we receive:

where u  means the velocity of the rest frame of the observer relative to space and v
0
between the frames under consideration, respectively. This implies that the principle
of relativity and, therewith, the group character of the Lorentz transformation remain
valid, but with the restriction that of any two frames of reference a time interval dt of
the frame with the higher velocity relative to space is really longer by the factor (1a) as
compared with the other system.
The above formulas predict that all clocks in the solar system run slower than a clock
resting relative to the microwave background, owing to its motion through the latter.
Furthermore, all clocks on Earth must run slower if during the year her velocity is in
the same direction spatially as the general motion of the sun and faster if her velocity
is in the other direction - compared with a clock resting relative to the sun.

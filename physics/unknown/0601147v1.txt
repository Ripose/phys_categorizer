Summary: This article demonstrates that a commonly-made assumption in quantum yield 
calculations may produce errors of up to 25% in extreme cases and can be corrected by a simple 
modification to the analysis. 

 
The radiative quantum yield is an 
important quantity in molecular chemistry. 
Defined as the fraction of molecules (of a 
particular compound) that emit a photon upon 
direct excitation by a source,[1] it is a 
measure of the proportion of de-excitation 
that occurs radiatively. Quantum yields 
provide important information regarding 
excited electronic states, radiationless 
transitions, and coupling of electronic to 
vibronic states. Moreover, they are used in the 
determination of chemical structures, sample 
purity, and appropriateness of laser media.[2-
4] For these reasons, it is important to have 
reliable methods of calculating accurate 
quantum yield values for new substances.  

Whilst the oldest and most fundamental 
methods for calculating the quantum yield are 
based on Vavilov’s method of measuring 
absolute luminescences,[5] these methods are 
difficult and require great precision. They 
have established certain compounds such as 
quinine sulphate and anthracene as standards 
with well-accepted quantum yield values,[6, 
7] but it is now more common to calculate 
quantum yields of new compounds by 
comparing emission rates to those of a known 
standard. These studies assume that the 
quantum yield is proportional to the ratio of 
fluorescence emission integrated across the 
spectrum to the absorption coefficient at the 
excitation wavelength.[8-10] However, it has 
been recently shown that the quantum yield is 
actually proportional to the ratio of integrated 
emission to (1-e-αd), where α is the absorption 
coefficient and d is the width of the excitation 
volume from which the detected fluorescence 
is emitted.[11] When the absorption 
coefficient and the sample thickness are

small, these methods are roughly equivalent. 
However, for substances with large 
coefficients (e.g. the natural pigment melanin, 
Fig. 1), this assumption is invalid. 

It should be noted that this is not merely 

a result of the inner filter effect, whose 
implications have been discussed 
previously,[1, 6, 12-14] but rather stems 
directly from the definition of the quantum 
yield. Although the quantum yield is defined 
as the ratio of emitted photons to absorbed 
photons,[1, 12] this is not equivalent to the 
ratio of emission intensity to absorbance.[11] 
Even when the inner filter effect is corrected 
for, use of this approximation in the 
calculation of quantum yield is still invalid. In 
this communication, the error incurred by this 
approximation is reported, showing that it is 
more significant than other errors which are 
currently taken into account in precise 
calculations of quantum yield. Synthetic 
eumelanin is used as an example due to its 
strong absorbance.

or 0.3 cm (dash). (b) Quantum yield values calculated using higher quinine sulphate concentrations

(note that factors of dex in the numerator and 
denominator have cancelled). This is the 
relation commonly used in quantum yield 
studies.[8-10] Whilst Eq. 1 is more exact than 

em

Eq. 2 in that it does not make use of the Taylor 
series approximation, it does require knowledge 
of the value of dex. Since this value represents 
the thickness of the volume in the cuvette from 
which fluorescence reaches the detector, it is 
not easily measured. Therefore, quantum yield 
values calculated using Eq. 1 have been 
obtained for three values of dex: 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 
cm. 

Resulting quantum yield values using 
both Eqs. 1 and 2 are displayed in Fig. 2a. First, 
it is clear that for increasing values of dex, the 
difference between the values calculated with 
Eq. 1 and Eq. 2 escalates due to 
correspondingly poorer approximations in the 
Taylor polynomial. Thus, the accuracy of the 
calculated quantum yield value is very 
dependent on the excitation volume width. For 
example, the absorption coefficient of the 
eumelanin solution used here at 250 nm is 2.27 
cm-1. Given an estimated excitation volume 
width of 0.1 cm, the quantum yield value 
calculated with Eq. 2 is in error by 10%. For 
dex=0.3 cm, the error jumps significantly to 
25%. At 400 nm excitation, where the 
absorption coefficient is much smaller, the 
corresponding errors in the quantum yield are 
4% and 10%, respectively. 

These data demonstrate that the error in 

using Eq. 2 is magnified significantly for 
samples with high absorption coefficients, but

use of Eq. 2 can produce significant errors even 
for samples with low absorbance if 
concentrated reference standards are used. For 
the data presented in Fig 2a, several quinine 
solutions, ranging in concentration from 1x10-6 
to 1x10-5 M in 1 N H2SO4 solution, were 
measured and a linear regression was applied to 
determine the optimal ratio for both Eqs. 1 and 
2. When more concentrated quinine solutions 
(1x10-6 to 1x10-4 M) were included in the 
regression, the quantum yield values did not 
converge with increasing excitation wavelength 
(decreasing melanin absorption coefficient, Fig. 
2b). This was because the error in the Taylor 
approximation on the high-concentration 
quinine solutions limited the available accuracy 
in the quantum yield values even when the 
melanin absorption coefficient is low. For this 
melanin solution, even at an absorption 
coefficient of 0.5 cm-1 (500 nm excitation) and 
dex=0.1 cm, the resulting error is 5%. When 
only high concentrations of quinine are used 
(1x10-5 to 1x10-4 M), this error is magnified 
further. This is an important consideration since 
quinine solutions of even greater concentration 
have been used previously in a highly cited 
paper.[6] 

(1-e-αd) factors in the numerator and 
denominator of Eq. 1 cancel each other out of 
the equation. Thus, variation of dex has no effect 
on the calculated quantum yield. 

In summary, the assumption often made – 
that quantum yield is proportional to the ratio of 
integrated emission to absorption coefficient – 
is not strictly correct. Depending on the sample 
absorption coefficient and excitation volume 
width, this approximation can produce errors of 
up to 25%. This is in addition to inner filter 
effects and stems from the definition of the 
quantum yield.  

Moreover, even when sample absorption 

coefficient values are small, use of high 
reference standard concentrations can limit the 
accuracy of calculated values to 5-10%. In 
contrast, acceptable precision for quantum yield 
values is on the order of a few percent,[15] and 
even a small variation of 0.25%/(cid:176) C in quantum 
yield values of quinine has been described as a 
“steep temperature dependence”.[6] Relative to 
errors such as temperature-dependence of the 
quantum yield and differences in refractive 
index and excitation wavelength between the 
sample and the reference standard (which are all 
routinely accounted for in accurate quantum 
yield measurements), the errors incurred by this 
approximation are large indeed. Given that they 
are removed by a simple alteration to the 
analysis, future quantum yield calculations 
should use Eq. 1, which follows directly from 
the mathematical definition of the quantum 
yield. 

A curious feature in Fig. 2b is the 
presence of an isosbestic point. The position of 
the isosbestic point depends on the reference 
standard concentrations used and represents the 
excitation wavelength where the absorption 
coefficient of melanin matches that of the 
reference standard, quinine. At this point, the

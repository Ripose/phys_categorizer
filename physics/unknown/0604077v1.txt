Abstract 
If  only  human  beings  would  breathe  the  entire  quantity  of  terrestrial  air,  then,  at  the 
present-day  population on the Earth, one million years would exhaust that air. It seems 
we have enough air. Is it so? 
 
Introduction 
This  paper  has  a  direct  target  of  education.  Recently,  I  have  asked  my  students 
(polytechnic first year) to answer the question : do we have enough air? Essentially , how 
many air molecules the terrestrial atmosphere has. Towards  my disappointment, I have 
received no appropriate  answer. Let’s see how do we deal with it. 
 
Method 1 
Let      p      be  the  atmospheric  pressure  at  the  sea  level.  From  the  pressure  definition,  

p =

, and  knowing that the force  F is due to the air weight, we will get the total mass

The  atmospheric  pressure  at  sea  level  is  1  atmosphere    =  101325  Pa,  and  the  average

the same number as the first method gave.                                       
 
Conclusions 
If the first method has given a huge number of air molecules, the second method gave the 
same result, but, in the same time, a very suggestive one: the entire quantity of air (liquid) 
4410
is a layer of only 11.7372 m height. It is, generally, hard to imagine what means  
, 
but easier, a height of almost 12 meters. So, do we have enough air? Not an easy answer! 

 molecules of air, almost 

Considering  that,  for  an  “  average  human  being”,  six  liters  per  minute  of  air  circulate 
trough his lungs, then one million years are necessary to breath in the total number of air 
molecules.  But,  not  only  human  beings  breath.  There  are  billions,  or  even  trillions,  of 
beings (or whatever) breathing in air. Fortunately, the air is recyclable. We ask ourselves 
if we breath in some number of molecules which already have been breathed by Einstein, 
for instance. Yes is the answer, situation which gives us some comfort hoping that those 
molecules of air will bring a seed of genius. But, what about the molecules breathed by 
Hitler, or Stalin, or who knows what monster? That one is not very comfortable. 
 
What about water?

which means 
. So, the ratio of the number 
of  water  molecule  and  the  number  of  air  molecules  is  463,  roughly  two  order  of 
magnitude.    It  does  not  seem  to  be  very  much.  But,  if  we  cover  the  Earth  with  entire 
quantity  of  water,  we  will  get  a  layer  of    2719  m  height!  Almost  3  Km!  Here  is  a 
significance of two order of magnitude.

Introduction 
 
It  is  has  been  an  interesting  subject  of  conversation  among  physicists,  the  question  of 
why  matter  is  in  a  major  proportion  in  the  universe  than  antimatter.  A  rational  answer, 
based  on  the  principles  of  quantum  mechanics  is  proposed  in  this  article.  Section  1 
discusses the relation between matter and antimatter.  The conclusion that comes up from 
section  1  is  that  matter,  must  predominate  over  antimatter  if  the  universe  is  ruled  by 
quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity. 
 
1. Matter and Antimatter 
 
In the one particle scheme Feynman and Stückelberg interpreted antiparticles as particles 
moving backwards in time [1]. This argument is endorsed by S. Weinberg, who realizes 
that  the  antiparticles  existence  is  a  consequence  of  the  violation  of  the  principle  of 
causality in quantum mechanics [2].  The temporal order of the events is distorted when a 
particle wanders in the neighborhood of the light cone.  How is the antimatter generated 
from matter?   According to Heisenberg uncertainty principle, a particle wandering in the 
neighborhood of the light-cone (see Fig. 1) suddenly tunnels from the timelike region to 
the spacelike; in this region the relation of cause and effect collapses.  Since if an event,

than the event at 
2x before the particle were emitted at 
by A, it is observed by B as if it were absorbed at
1x . The temporal order of the particle is inverted. This event is completely feasible in the 
neighborhood of the light-cone, since the uncertainty principle allows a particle to tunnel 
from time-like cone section to space-like cone region.  That is, the uncertainty principle 
consents  the  time-like  interval  to  reach  values  greater  than  zero  as  is  shown  by  next 
equation,

moving  forward  in  time  with 
positive  energy,  and  opposite

is emitted at

2x .    With  this  reinterpretation

recovered.  According 
discussion above, a particle has to 
violate 
the 
special  theory  of  relativity,  of  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light  to  become  an 
antiparticle. But, this violation of this postulate of the theory of relativity must be correct 
to  maintain  the  consistency  of  the  principles  of  quantum  mechanics  (Heisenberg 
uncertainty  principle).  This  violation  of  the  postulate  of  the  special  theory  of  relativity 
occurs in a very short time period according to the uncertainty principle. Therefore, the 
recombination of matter and antimatter is immediate. The Compton wavelength is a very 
small distance (see ref. 2) for elementary particles and extremely short for higher masses.

That is the probability for crossing the barrier, between time-like and space-like regions, 
decreases when the mass of the particle increases. Therefore, the formation of antimatter 
(matter moving backward in time) is not a frequent event. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The proposed mechanism for the creation of antimatter in Ref. 2 leads to the conclusion 
that  the  creation  of  antimatter  is  an  energetically  unfavorable  event.  From  here,  in  the 
present energetic state of the universe matter is more abundant than antimatter. Perhaps in 
a certain moment, after the big bang, the universe was in a state of equilibrium between 
matter  and  antimatter.  At  the  present  time,  the  universe  is  cold  enough  to  allow  that 
matter to be in a major proportion than antimatter.

Since 
cranio-
maxillofacial  surgery  was  interested  in 
computer  aided  techniques.  It  was  first 
as  an  aid  for  diagnostic.  CT  imaging

The  department  of  maxillofacial  and 
facial  plastic  surgery 
from  Purpan 
in  Toulouse  has  had  a 
Hospital 
computer  aided  navigation  system  for 
five  years, 
collaboration  with 
departments  of  neurosurgery  and  ENT 
surgery.  Its  current  utilization  is  quietly 
limited to strict navigation by lack of the 
specific  tools  for  cranio-maxillofacial 
surgery.  By  the  way,  we  try  to  extend 
these  applications:  we  present  some  of

previously  described  in  literature  [3,4]. 
Tools  (a  reference  framework  and  a 
pointer) are located in space by 3 active 
diodes  each,  infrared  emitting.  These 
active  tools  are  seen  by  an  optical 
tracker  (a  camera).  At  the  beginning  of 
the  surgical  operation, 
the  patient's 
anatomy  and  the  virtual  patient's  image 
reconstructed from the pre operative CT 
scan  imaging  are  rigidly  matched  point 
for point. Then, the pointer tip is located 
in  the  surgical  field  and  showed  in  the 
same  time  on  the  CT  scan  or  NMR 
slides.  Planning  is  limited  to  surgical 
trajectories between two defined points.

-  Orbital surgery as an aid for setting 
up  a  bone  graft  or  an  implant,  or  for 
optimising decompression osteotomy. 
Using  the  "surgical  planning"  function, 
we have "extended" applications for: 
-  Wiring  implant  in  a  small  bone 
volume (implant, mandibular distractor). 
-  Zygomatic osteotomy repositioning. 
 
2.  About  orbital 
exophtalmia 
 
Exophthalmia  in  Basedow  disease  is  an 
excessive  forward  displacement  of  the 
ocular globe outside the orbit, by orbital

Its  consequences  can  be  functional 
(cornea  injury,  diplopia,  lost  of  visual 
acuity) or aesthetic. 
Surgery  can  be  used  for  exophthalmia 
reduction  by  removing  inferior,  medial 
or  lateral  orbital  walls,  according  to  the 
required backward displacement.  
Computer  aided  navigation  is  used  for 
optimising orbital osteotomy, preserving 
the optical nerve.

Computer  aided  maxillofacial  surgery 
has  been  well  defined

[5,6,7]  and  can  be  summarized  as  on

measurements. 
The  biomechanical  facial  soft-tissue 
model  uses finite element (FE) method 
[9]. First, a “generic” model of the face 
is manually built, integrating skin layers 
and  muscles.  Then,  the  mesh  of  this 
generic  model  is  conformed  to  each 
patient  morphology,  using  an  elastic 
registration  method  and  patient  data 
segmented  from  CT  images  (figure  3). 
This  automatically  generated  specific 
model  is  suitable  for  simulation  by 
displacing internal nodes as the surgical 
procedure does.

1.3  Discussion 
 
These  models support the surgical bone 
osteotomies  simulation  and  the  post 
operative facial soft-tissues deformation 
prediction. First clinical validations have 
been done (figure 4). 
There  are  actually  few  propositions  for 
3D cephalometric analysis [10,11]. They 
are mainly orthodontic analysis oriented 
and  unusable 
for  computer  aided 
surgery.

2  Surgery for exophthalmia 
 
2.1  Purpose 
 
Current  therapeutic  planning  in  surgery 
for  exophthalmia  is  quite  empiric  about 
localization  and  size  of  the  orbital  wall 
osteotomy.  Planning  respect  is  mostly 
important in this bilateral surgery. 
Planning might be improved by an orbit 
model 
for  backward  displacement 
prediction  according  to  the  osteotomy. 
Intra  operative  navigation  will  be 
helpful  for  strict  respect  of  the  relevant 
planning.

2.2  Method 
 
A  biomechanical  3D  Finite  Element 
(FE)  model  of  the  orbit  [12],  including 
muscles,  fat  tissues  and  orbital  walls  is 
defined.  First,  a  generic  3D  model  is 
built. Then, the generic mesh is adapted 
 
 
2.3  Discussion 
 
There  is  no  such  previous  FE  orbital 
model.  Its  qualitative  relevance  for 
orbital  decompression  simulation  has 
been  shown.  Neitherless,  quantitative 
validation has to be done. 
This  method  is  still  time  computing 
consuming  and  has  to  be  improved  for 
current clinical application.

Computer  aided 
surgical  performance.  Its  use  will  be 
mostly increased by developing specific 
models  and  softwares  for  the  different 
studied  pathologies.  After  planning  and 
simulation,  we  will  have  to  address 
navigation.

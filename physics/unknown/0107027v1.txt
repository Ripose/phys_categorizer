INDUCED  GRAVITY  IN  THE  SHORT  
RANGE  

C.P. Kouropoulos† 
 
 
Abstract 

We consider a pair of harmonic oscillators in two or three dimensions of space coupled by the 
standard  electrodynamic  forces  :  the  Coulomb,  the  Lorentz  and  the  electrokinetic  forces.  The 
addition of the Lorentz force is mainly felt in the short range and suppresses the radial correlated 
oscillating  mode of such coupled  oscillators. This imposes constraints on the system that make 
the  two  transverse  modes  degenerate.  As  a  result,  the  -1/r  gravitational  interaction  now  only 
appears  in  the  surviving  anticorrelated  radial  zero-mode,  which  does  not  allow  coherent 
gravitating states to form. As gravitation can only emerge from the intrinsic dynamics of this zero 
mode at short range, it can no longer be transitive. Matter in high densities would thus tend to 
increase its disorder, decouple from its own gravity and from the ordering far infrared Machian 
background  that  coheres  its  rest  energy  and  would  become  intrinsically  unstable.  The  highly 
energetic jets from galactic nuclei could be the consequence.

We now solve the problem of our coupled oscillators in the light of Planck’s and 
Post’s  ensemble  interpretation  of  the  zero-point  energy.  Planck’s  original  result 
involved counting the number of uncoupled harmonic oscillators that partake in the 
field’s motions in a disordered system averaged over some random phase φ  of the 

oscillators  at  a  given  frequency.  If  instead  of  phase-independent  non-interacting 
oscillators  we  have  a  system  of  coupled  oscillators  of  which  we  count  the 
individual  correlated  motions,  this  approach  yields  very  different  results  than  for 
the  uncoupled  case  studied  by  Planck.  This  point  has  also  been  stressed  by  Post. 
We assume that our oscillators can be diagonalized into two fundamental modes, of 
correlated or anticorrelated motions whose eigenfrequencies are ω−  and ω+ , that a 
vast majority of the oscillators are phase-correlated and contribute to the ω− mode, 
that  an  oscillator  whose  phase  shifts  from  φ    to  φ+π    increases  the  occupation 
number of one mode while decreasing that of the other, and that one such isolated 
transition  does  not  substantially  affect  the  two  fundamental  frequencies  of  the 
system.

The correlation tends to be transitive, even considering retardation. The correlated 
modes  can  form  coherent  stationary  or  propagating  states  in  large  ensembles 
whereas  the  anticorrelation  tends  to  self-destruct  as  the  anticorrelated  modes 
mutually  exclude  one  another.  So  it  is  natural  that  the  anticorrelating  zero-modes 
should  resemble  those  of  a  fermionic  oscillator  and  have  the  corresponding 
statistics. Supersymmetry naturally emerges in this context, from coupled harmonic 
oscillators. If a fraction κ  of the oscillators is in a random uncoupled phase, this 
fraction will be described by the habitual Bose statistics. As a result, using [11], the 
mean energy of the transverse modes can be approximated as

a 1/r dependence results from ρω  = C. It induces a 3hκc/2r antigravity contribution 
from  κ ≠  0  in  [17]  and  [18]  and  a  -  h(1-κ)c/2r    gravitational  term  from  the  lone 
fermionic  radial  zero-mode.  Its  anticorrelated  Fermi  statistics  forbids  it  from 
forming  mutually  gravitating  coherent  states.    Note  how  the  radial  zero-mode 
contains a series of repulsive Van der Waals terms at higher orders. The addition of 
the  magnetic  coupling  in  two  or  three  dimensions  therefore  changes  the  situation 
relative  to  one  single  dimension,  kills  the  correlated  radial  mode  and  makes  the 
frequencies of the two transverse excited modes degenerate. The mean energy from 
the zero-modes related to the three dimensions at some frequency is

so  that,  assuming  that  κ < ⅓(1−κ)  at  moderate  temperatures  T,  the  attractive  but 
chaos-inducing  η+    zero-mode  still  dominates.  The  excited  states  have  a 
predominantly  positive  energy  and  result  in  antigravitation.  With  an  increasing 

temperature, κ  is expected to increase as the thermal random motions destroy the 
order, which also governs the zero-modes of the radial anticorrelated states. Such 
an  effect  is  expected  to  dominate  during  the  primal  inflationary  phases  of  the 
Universe or within very dense cosmic objects. Each interacting mode extends about 
the  oscillator  in  some  finite  near-field  volume  that  shrinks  as  the  cube  of  the 
frequency,  so  that  we  are  not  faced  with  the  prospect  of  integrating  the  ZPE  of 
empty  space,  except  in  the  far  infrared  from  distant  matter.  Such  a  derivation  is 
well  suited  to  models  such  as  A.O.  Barut’s  unified  electromagnetic  theory  of 
matter, to Dyonic schemes and may even be applied to the standard model. In the 
very short range, since the Van der Waals forces can be predominantly repulsive, it 
is  expected  that  it  is  the  electrodynamic  interactions,  such  as  from  the  magnetic 
moments of spinning matter or the Ampère forces between relativistic currents that 
take  over  and  hold  the  particles  together.  Far  away,  the  magnetic  as  well  as  the 
Coulomb  dipole-dipole  interactions  become  negligible  before  the  electrokinetic 
near-field, and the corresponding terms can be omitted, yielding results similar to 
our previous analysis. 
 
To conclude, the magnetic interaction induces chaos at short range and destroys the 
coherence of the mutually gravitating, stable forms of matter.

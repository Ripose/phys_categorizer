Extensive Bose-Einstein condensation research activities1,2 have recently led to 

studies of fermionic atoms and optical confinements3-6. Here we present a case of 

micro-optical fermionic electron phase transition. Optically confined ordering and 

phase transitions of a fermionic cloud in dynamic steady state are associated with   

Rayleigh emissions from photonic quantum ring manifold which are generated by 

nature without any ring lithography7. The whispering gallery modes, produced in 

a semiconductor Rayleigh-Fabry-Perot toroidal cavity at room temperature, 

exhibit novel properties of ultralow thresholds open to nano-ampere regime, 

thermal stabilities from  T -dependent spectral shift, and angularly varying 

intermode spacings. The photonic quantum ring phenomena are associated with a 

photonic field-driven phase transition of quantum-well-to-quantum-wire and 

hence the photonic (non-de Broglie) quantum corral effect8 on the Rayleigh cavity-

confined carriers in dynamic steady state. Based upon the intra-cavity fermionic 

condensation we also offer a prospect for an electrically driven few-quantum dot 

2

 

single photon source from the photonic quantum ring laser for quantum 

information processors9,10. 

Current fermionic cloud shown in Fig. 1a involves a site ordering from a random 

distribution of two-dimensional (2D) quantum well (QW) electrons to one-dimensional 

(1D) quantum wire electron arrays, or as explained later to a 1D chain of quasi quantum 

dot (QD) electrons. To address the fermionic condensation problem we briefly explain 

the photonic quantum ring (PQR) phenomena here. First of all, the ultralow threshold 

current data at room temperature of the three-dimensional (3D) PQR laser (Fig. 1b) 

follow a simplified formula derived for 2D concentric quantum ring arrays7:

where neff is the effective azimuthal refractive index, N1D

tr the transparency 

carrier density, λPQR the emission wavelength, τ the carrier lifetime, η the quantum 

efficiency, w≡1-neff/n=WRayleigh/(φ/2) the normalized Rayleigh bandwidth, φ the 

diameter, d=λ0/n the active region thickness, αi the intrinsic loss, g’1d the differential 

gain, and R ≈ 1. 

The reason why the simplified 2D formula works well is that the actual gain 

comes from the 2D QW plane. Data in Fig. 1c, curve A, for either full or hollow mesa 

PQRs, are consistent with the theoretical prediction. It also indicates that the PQRs of 5 

µm or less in diameter would begin to enter the nano-ampere threshold regime easily. 

Details of the device and measurements were reported earlier7.   

If the physical bandwidth of the annular PQR region occupying the Rayleigh-

Fabry-Perot cavity, given by

One then gets curve B in Fig. 1c, being far off from the actual threshold data, 

which implies that the emission of the PQR is associated not with the QWs but with the 

quantum wires or rings in character. This difference is the reason why the threshold of 

the conventional vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) is roughly up to 1,000 

times that of the PQR in similar shape, as shown previously7. 

The PQR production described above implies a sudden dynamic phase transition 

that is induced by the PQR emission in the cavity since the Rayleigh region was simply 

a peripheral region of the normal QW plane before the emission. The random 

distribution of electrons in the QW plane must have experienced an abrupt ordering of 

quantum wire type for the PQR. It is abrupt since the PQR modulation behaviors at 

reasonably high frequencies are not so different from the VCSEL dynamics in general. 

The PQR threshold analysis further demands the PQR spacing to be λ/2. 

A possible explanation for the fermionic condensation comes as follows: 

Electronic quantum corral work8 suggests a local density of state (LDOS) along the 

peripheral Rayleigh toroid in the first place. Onset of the emission, even with a small 

injection, then tends to laser-trap and order the carriers in the cavity. Of course the 

fermionic condensation is for the average carriers in dynamic steady state since the e-h 

recombination process has already begun. The laser trapping taking place in the 

Rayleigh toroid will be similar to the gradient-field-induced trapping form calculated by 

Letokhov and Minogin12 in a cavity of standing modes which impose a photonic (non-

de Broglie) spacing of λ/2 on the neutral particle’s transverse distribution. Exact 

calculations for such fermionic phase transitions, if available, will tell how this kind of 

photonic quantum corral effect (PQCE) governs the dynamic redistribution phenomena. 

4

 

1a. 

This PQCE seems to be the only feasible interpretation of the unusual dynamic 

transition of QW-to-PQR phase. We further note that the photonic spacing of λ/2 should 

prevail in transverse as well as longitudinal directions obviously. In fact the chains of 

quasi-QD will be distributed along the longitudinal standing modes trapping the 

dynamic carrier cloud in the Rayleigh region of the active QW plane as shown in Fig. 

Recently λ/2-spaced optical corral calculations for dielectric cavities have 

appeared13 and in fact such photonic spacings have been observed through near-field 

optical scanning tunneling experiments on the Rayleigh whispering gallery modes from 

an optically pumped dielectric microcavity14. On the other hand, low-temperature 

scanning tunneling microscopy studies have revealed de Broglie structures of the LDOS 

in electronic Fabry-Perot resonators. This LDOS study however is limited to the surface 

state electrons, and presently a better probing is needed in order to observe the non-de 

Broglie electronic structures undergoing the fermionic condensation in the PQR cavity. 

The PQR structure should in fact be residing in the Rayleigh torus, which is 3-5 µm 

below the device surface because of the top distributed-Bragg-reflector (DBR) mirror 

stack sitting above the active region. Nevertheless the Kapitza-Dirac experimental 

results are encouraging evidence associated with the PQCE in that free electrons are 

diffracted due to a standing light wave15. 

Spectral narrowings with increased injection currents were observed, and as 

shown in Fig. 1d, the narrowest linewidth observed, for example from a 10  ㎛  device 

with an optical spectrum analyzer (OSA) (HP 70951A: The resolution band width limit 

of the OSA = 0.8 Å), is as narrow as ∆λ1/2=0.55 Å at an injection current of 800  ㎂, 

which suggests a Q value of 15,000 or better16. Perfectly smooth cylindrical PQRs with 

the chemically assisted ion beam-etched sidewall roughness << 0.1um, being far less 

than emission wavelengths, will further promise even narrower and scattering-free 

 

5

linewidths. We note that the present result is already near the linewidth of a fine single 

QD, observed only through optical pumping17. Recently fabricated 1K PQR array shows 

very uniform continuous-wave emissions (Fig. 1e) at room temperature, which is 

expected from peculiar thermal stabilities due to  T -dependent peak shifts as 

discussed previously7. 

The photons helically propagate clockwise and counterclockwise in the 3D 

Rayleigh toroid of the PQR lasers. These clockwise and counterclockwise chiral waves 

always share the same helical path back and forth, and their vectorial sum gives rise to 

the external emissions in radial direction. We have earlier reported that this intra-cavity 

chiral propagation leads to a breaking of vertical-axis rotational symmetry, leading to 

the evanescent tunneling and propagation crossover unlike any other microcavity 

lasers18.   

Although the wavelengths of individual modes are predetermined for a given 

device, typical Rayleigh resonances also exhibit angularly varying peak envelopes19 of 

the off-normal resonance as shown in Fig. 2. Another angular variation of the intermode 

spacings only observed in the PQR laser is also peculiar, and may become a new source 

for the wavelength-division-multiplexing (WDM) scheme utilizing non-equal interval 

spectra in the future. A family of angle vs. mode spacing curves is now compared with a 

knot model20 calculation, which gives an excellent account of 3D WDM ray 

propagation characteristics of the PQR manifold such as the non-equal mode spacing. 

Details of the knot model analysis will be reported elsewhere. We notice a growing 

trend of the mode spacings and widening modal decompositions as the device size is 

reduced. Actually the number of rings given by

  is predicting a 

single PQR regime and emergence of single frequency lasing as well for φ < 3 µm for 

current GaAs/AlGaAs PQRs. 

6

 

Self-organized multiple QD lasers21,22 have appeared in mid-90s and the QD 

laser work applied to the realization of few-QD single photon sources (SPS)23,24 has 

only recently made substantial progress for quantum computing applications25-27. The 

current QD SPS studies however rely mostly upon multi QDs grown on the active 

VCSEL layer24, the surface of 2D micro-disks used for thumbtack-type whispering 

gallery lasers25, or the active layer of light-emitting diodes26. These methods will 

typically involve ‘by chance’ fabrication steps like QD growth, mesa etching, 

confirmation of the surfactant QDs, and selection of appropriate single or few QDs 

before identifying the right SPS dot, which will be rather tedious and highly unreliable 

for any effective device fabrications. 

Considering a knot model illustration like Fig. 3a for the PQR’s chiral manifold, 

what will happen when we reduce the PQR diameter size toward and below the 

emission wavelength? Figure 3b for instance corresponds to a wavelength-size PQR 

which carries only a couple of standing modes let alone the single frequency behavior, 

so that a novel PQR SPS laser can be realized ‘at will’ not ‘by chance’ as follows:   

Figure 3c shows a hyperboloid structure being made for 0.1-0.3 µm PQRs. The top 

surface is large enough for easy electrode fabrication while the central minimum region 

of the active QW plane serves as the few-QD Rayleigh cavity. Properly pinned PQR 

modes from a 2 QD states like Fig. 3b will give a dipole radiation, useful for the SPS 

operation. As the device size shrinks the surface nonradiative recombination loss 

becomes significant. Nevertheless it is worthwhile to test micro-to-nano-size devices in 

a near future since such a nano-PQR is for ultrasmall injection purpose, and the surface 

loss, being proportional to the carrier-density, may not harm the device for quantum dot 

applications.

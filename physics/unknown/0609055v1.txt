Abstract - The subject of this work is the instability mechanism of simple shear flows, like Hagen-Poiseuille 
pipe  flow,  which  is  a  long-standing  problem  in  fluid  mechanics  [1,2].  A  possible  analogy  with 
phenomenological theory of ideal plasticity in solids is explored. It allows an extension of the Navier-Stokes 
equations making the simple shear flows unstable. 
Following von Mises [4], the existence of maximal allowed shear stress or “yield stress” in fluid is assumed. 
After the actual stresses have reached this value, a new physical mechanism will be activated attempting to 
reduce  them.  This  mechanism  results  in  a  pressure-like  force,  which  has  to  be  added  to  the  Navier-Stokes 
equations.  The  yield  stress  itself  is  a  material  constant,  which  does  not  depend  on  the  Reynolds  number  of 
particular flow. It will be shown how to estimate its value from experimental data. 
To demonstrate how the character of flow changes if the additional force is taken into account, an unsteady 
flow  in  a  2D  nozzle  is  presented.  The  momentum  source  was  introduced  in  the  Navier-Stokes  equations 
through  the  user-defined  function’s  interface  offered  by  Fluent  [6].  The  initial  data  and  the  results  of 
simulation are summarized in appendix. 

 

1. Analogy with plasticity theory 

The presence of pressure gradient in transverse to the flow direction is known to be a reason 
for instability in some types of shear flows, like Taylor-Couette flow [1]. In contrast to that, 
the reason for instability of shear flows without transverse pressure gradient is still not fully 
understood [2]. This work attempts to clarify this mechanism by extending the Navier-Stokes 
equations  “forcing”  their  instability  in  the  case  of  simple  shear  flows.  An  assumption  that 
mechanical behavior of Newton fluids includes also a plasticity-like mechanism resulting in 
an additional transverse pressure, allows such an extension. 
The  study  of  the  instability  mechanism  of  shear  flows  is  motivated  not  only  by  its  great 
industrial significance, but also by its key role in the turbulence phenomenon [3]. 
 
1.1. Yield stress 

Following von Mises [4] we assume that, similar to metals, shear stresses in Newton fluid can 
not exceed some value – the yield stress (σxy ≤ τ0), which is a material constant. It seems also 
physical to assume that this constant has a similar nature as molecular viscosity of fluid (µ), 
i.e.  highly  viscous  materials  possessing  a  large  yield  stress  as  well.  In  other  words,  in 
materials like honey the turbulence is not expected. 
To generalize this idea to 2D or 3D case, it is important to guarantee the frame invariance of 
the  plastic  yielding  criterion.  Obviously,  for  isotropic  materials  the  onset  of  plastic 
deformations  must  be  independent  of  rotation  of  coordinate  system.  It  is  also  known  that 
during plastic yielding, metals behave as an incompressible material and therefore the yield 
criterion  must  be  independent  of  volumetric  pressure.  Due  to  these  reasons,  von  Mises  has

proposed the distortion energy as a suitable expression for the equivalent stress (σMises):

It seems physical to assume, that the transition to turbulence does not depend on volumetric 
pressure as well. Therefore, the von Mises equivalent stress is adopted in this work.   
 
1.2. Additional vorticity 

If taken alone, the hypothesis concerning the existence of maximal allowed shear stress is not 
very  helpful.  It  is  necessary  to  make  an  assumption  about  the  physical  mechanism,  which 
allows reduction of Newton shear stresses to fulfil the von Mises criterion (Eq. 1). Obviously, 
in  the  case  of  the  rigid  body  rotation  the  shear  stresses  are  equal  to  zero.  This  observation 
), which corresponds to the 
suggests an introduction in the model of additional vorticity (
partial rigid body rotation appearing spontaneously in the areas of shear flow where the von 
Mises criterion is violated. Its counterpart in plasticity is the plastic strain tensor. 
For isotropic solids, the rate of plastic strain tensor is coaxial to the elastic strain tensor [4]. It 
seems physical to assume that in the case of isotropic fluid the vector of additional vorticity is 
coaxial with the rotor of the instant velocity field:

Aω

(cid:71)

A

=

1
λ rot
2

(cid:71)
u

, 0

≤ <

λ 1

 

The scalar λ defines the amount of rigid body rotation, which is necessary to reduce the actual 
Newton stresses to the yield limit τ0. Its counterpart in plasticity is the Lagrange multiplier. In 
some cases, where the expression for equivalent stress is simple enough, like von Mises one, 
its  value  can  be  determined  analytically  from  Equation  1.  In  computational  plasticity,  this 
procedure is known as “radial return method” [4]. It projects the elastic stress tensor (in our 
case Newton stresses) onto the yield surface. 
In order to derive an analytical expression for parameter λ, the gradient of the instant velocity 
field with additional vorticity must be rewritten in the matrix form. Following our coaxiality 
assumption (Eq. 2) it reads:

To obtain a new value of stress tensor only the symmetric part of the new velocity gradient 
has  to  be  taken.  It  is  easy  to  verify  that  projected  stresses  are  equal  to  the  Newton  stresses 
multiplied  by  (1 – λ).  Substitution  of  these  new  stresses  into  the  von  Mises  yield  criterion 
(Eq. 1) leads to the following expression for λ:

1.3. Additional force 

Now  we  have  to  decide  how  to  incorporate  the  additional  vorticity  in  the  momentum 
conservation  equations.  Our  approach  shall  not  be  confused  with  the  theory  of  micropolar 
continuum  [5],  where  vorticity  is  treated  as  an  independent  variable.  We  have  assumed  the 
fluid  particles  do  not  have  any  rotary  inertia  and  therefore  the  conservation  of  linear 
momentum only must be considered. This has two practical advantages:   

- 
- 

the stress tensor remains symmetric; 
there is no need in separate boundary conditions for vorticity. 

The second Newton’s law suggests that the spontaneous generation of additional vorticity has 
to be interpreted at the continuum level as the result of acting of some centrifugal force:

Simple  calculations  show  that  the  force  must  indeed  depend  on  the  velocity  (violating  the 
Galilean invariance!). Due to the spontaneous character of the additional vorticity, the change 
of velocity component uy by duy must be considered as given. On the other hand, this change 
takes place during the time while the particle is being located in the control volume dv. This 
time interval T is dx/ux. According to the second Newton’s law, we obtain:

Due to its centrifugal character, the additional force has two important properties:

2. Estimation of the yield stress τ0 

An accurate determination of the yield stress of some fluid requires a careful evaluation of the 
experimental data. This is the subject of future work. It is possible however to obtain a rough 
estimation of this material constant. To this end, the original Reynolds experiment [1,3] has to 
be interpreted anew taking into account the proposed plasticity-like instability mechanism. It 
predicts  transverse  pressure  gradient  in  the  wall  regions,  where  the  von  Mises  criterion  is 
violated (Fig. 1).

Turbulence, Heat and Mass Transfer 5 

It is important to understand that if the von Mises criterion is nowhere violated, then the shear 
flow is stable. This is in a good qualitative agreement with the observations of Reynolds, who 
found  out  that  if  velocity  in  pipe  flow  does  not  exceed  some  critical  value  then  all 
perturbations  of  the  parabolic  flow,  large  as  well  as  small  decay  eventually.  This  allows  an 
estimation of the yield stress of water. The minimal critical Reynolds number (Re = umean·d/ν) 
is  known  to  be  2000.  The  diameter  of  the  one  of  the  Reynolds  pipes  was  approximately 
0.02 m.  The  density  of  water  is  1000 kg/m3  and  its  molecular  viscosity  is  0.001 N·sec/m2. 
From where it follows, that critical mean velocity  is  0.1 m/sec.  The  velocity  gradient  at  the 
wall is 30 sec-1. The corresponding shear stress is 3e-2 N/m2. This value is assumed to be the 
yield stress of water. 
 
3. Example 

To demonstrate how the character of flow changes if the additional force is taken into account, 
an unsteady flow in a 2D nozzle is presented. An interesting result of this simulation is the 
flow separation before the nozzle, which is not predicted by laminar calculation. 
The  momentum  source  was  introduced  in  the  Navier-Stokes  equations  through  the 
user-defined function’s interface offered by Fluent [6]. The initial data and the results of the 
simulation are summarized in appendix. The yield stress of the air was estimated according to 
our assumption concerning the similarity in physical nature of the molecular viscosity and the 
yield stress (Sec. 1.1).

4. Closure 

Detailed study of the physical nature of this plasticity-like mechanism of instability in shear 
flows  is  the  subject  of  future  work.  For  the  time  being,  it  can  be  understood  as  a  simple 
numerical trick, which “forces” the instability of linearly stable flows, like Hagen-Poiseuille 
pipe  flow.  The  proposed  source  term  can  be  easily  implemented  in  existing  CFD-Software 
allowing its numerical verification. This makes it potentially useful for practical applications.

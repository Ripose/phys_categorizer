The Cross Potent Superhybrid

Abstract-- In this letter, we present a novel four-way 
divider/combiner in rectangular waveguide. The design is 
completely two-dimensional in the h-plane, with eight-fold 
mirror symmetry, and is based on a recent four-port hybrid 
design [6].  In combining mode, it can function as a phased 
array with four inputs and four outputs.  The planar nature of 
this design provides advantages, such as the freedom to 
increase the waveguide height beyond the over-moding limit in 
order to reduce field strengths.  Along with its open geometry, 
this makes it ideal for high-power applications where rf break 
down is a concern.  Design criteria, field-solver simulation 
results, and prototype measurements are presented.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

Designs for a next-generation 0.5–1 TeV center-of-mass 
electron/positron collider [1],[2] call for power combined 
from each group of several 11.424 GHz  75 MW klystrons 
to power spacially separated sets of high-gradient 
accelerator structures of the main linacs through a Delay 
Line Distribution System (DLDS) [3],[4].  The rf is directed 
appropriately through source phasing during different time 
bins, yielding a pulse compression effect, in which each 
accelerator feed sees a peak power several times higher 
than that of a single source for a fraction of the klystron 
pulse width.   
 
The basic requirement at the heart of this scheme is a 
phased array capable of directing pulsed rf from four inputs 
to four outputs (three delay lines and a local feed) at peak 
power levels reaching 600 MW.  This can be accomplished 
with a set of hybrids and a pattern of discrete phase changes 
in the source drive signals.  In prototype rf systems 
employing WR90 magic T's under high-vacuum for 
combining and directing power, rf breakdown proved to be 
a problem at power levels much exceeding 200 MW [5].   
Autopsies revealed the problem to be between the matching 
element and the mouth of the e-bend.

This motivated the design of an alternative to the magic T, a 
novel planar hybrid capable of reliably handling hundreds 
of megawatts of peak power at X-band.  Small apertures, 
slots, matching posts, and field-enhancing e-bends were 
avoided to reduce the risk of rf breakdown.  This new 
hybrid, reported on in [6], consists of four rectangular 
waveguide ports, operated in the TE10 mode, connected 
through two h-plane T-junctions, yielding an "H" geometry.  
The connecting waveguide carries two modes. 
 
A further development led to a component, based on the 
same design technique, which provides the desired function 
of a set of four hybrids in a single compact device.  This 
eight-port combiner/splitter has been named the "cross 
potent superhybrid", after the heraldic symbol its geometry 
recalls.   Each port is matched, isolated from three other 
ports, and coupled equally to the four remaining ports.  As 
the above-mentioned hybrid, or “magic H” serves as a sort 
of stepping stone to the cross potent superhybrid, we shall 
recount here the theory, design method and advantages of 
the former device. 

II.  MAGIC H HYBRID 

The magic H is a quadrature hybrid (i.e. the coupled port 
fields are 90° out of phase with each other) with directly 
opposite port pairs isolated.  It can be viewed as a variation 
of the branchline coupler with the two connecting 
transmission lines collapsed into one waveguide utilizing 
two modes.  A closer comparison might be made with the 
Riblet short-slot coupler [7], which employs the same 
coupling mechanism, although the “H” geometry provides 
separated ports and no mismatch due to wall thickness. 
 
A key feature of this hybrid is its planar design.  Matching 
features maintain the translational symmetry in the 
direction of the electric fields, so that the fields terminate 
only on the flat top and bottom surfaces.  This H-plane 
symmetry allows the use of over-moded rectangular 
waveguide, in which the height has been increased to 
reduce field amplitudes, without affecting the scattering 
matrix.  Theoretically, the height of the device can thus be 
arbitrarily increased to accommodate higher power. 
 

The geometry of the magic H hybrid is illustrated in 
Figure 1.  The connecting waveguide is wide enough to 
accommodate both TE10 and TE20 mode propagation.  The 
fields of a single port excite these modes with equal 
amplitudes and a relative phase such that their fields add 
constructively on the side nearest the input port and 
destructively on the other side.  As their guide 
wavenumbers are different, their relative phase changes as 
WKH\(cid:3)SURSDJDWH(cid:3)DORQJ(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)JXLGH(cid:17)(cid:3)(cid:3)$(cid:3)QHW(cid:3)SKDVH(cid:3)VOLS(cid:3)RI(cid:3) (cid:3)
radians would cause the TE10 wave to enhance the opposite 
lobe of the TE20 wave, sending the power out the farthest 
port.  To get a 3-dB split, therefore, the total phase lengths 
IRU(cid:3)WKHVH(cid:3)WZR(cid:3)PRGHV(cid:3)PXVW(cid:3)GLIIHU(cid:3)E\(cid:3)DQ(cid:3)RGG(cid:3)PXOWLSOH(cid:3)RI(cid:3) (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:17) 

inputs and four outputs.  The two sources feeding each first-
stage hybrid are phased so as to combine in one or the other 
of its output ports (canceling in the fourth port).  These 
combined waves are directed to the same second-stage 
hybrid during a given time bin.  The relative phase between 
the source pairs provides another degree of freedom, so that 
the power arriving at the second-stage hybrid can be 
combined and directed to one or the other of its output 
ports.  This arrangement is illustrated schematically in 
Figure 2. 

 

Figure 1.  H-planar geometry of the magic H hybrid.  Power-flow arrows 

illustrate splitting function (reverse for combining). 
 
The T-junctions are matched by shaping the walls with 
blunt, triangular protrusions at the symmetry plane.  The 
result is essentially a side-wall coupler with the common 
wall removed and two back-to-back mitred 90° bends at 
either end.  The connecting guide must be narrower than 
twice the standard guide width in order to keep the TE30 
mode cut off.  With the ports constrained to half the width 
of the connecting guide, standard reference curves or tables 
can be used to determine the dimension of the 45° mitres.  
The TE20 (odd) mode is matched independently at each 
junction, as it sees an effective mitred bend.  The TE10 
(even) mode is matched for discrete lengths of the 
connecting guide, at which the mismatches of the two 
junctions cancel.  The width of the connecting guide is 
adjusted until a reasonable matching length also yields the 
required  (cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:3)SKDVH(cid:3)OHQJWK(cid:3)GLIIHUHQFH(cid:3)WKURXJK(cid:3)WKH(cid:3)K\EULG(cid:3)IRU(cid:3)
the two modes.  The code HFSS [8] was used extensively in 
the design process to calculate scattering matrices. 

III.  CROSS POTENT SUPERHYBRID 

Often, a microwave circuit containing a configuration of 
multiple hybrids is required for a particular application.  As 
mentioned above, the Delay Line Distribution System [3], 
conceived as a means of efficiently delivering high-power 
rf to the particle accelerator structures of a next-generation 
linear collider, requires power from four sources to be 
combined and delivered sequentially (by means of phase 
shifts) to four output waveguides.  This can be done with 
four hybrids, two stages of two.  One output port of each of 
the first two hybrids is connected to one input port of each 
of the second two, so that the combined circuit has four

four input signals to any of four outputs. 
 
The same functionality can be achieved in a single eight-
port device based on the magic H.  Imagine placing two 
such such hybrids side-by-side and removing the common 
wall, leaving only the diamond shaped post formed by the 
two triangular mitre protrusions.  The two combined ports 
formed are indistinguishable from the interior connecting 
guides.  That is, the junction around the diamond-shaped 
post is four-fold symmetric.  Adding mitred splits to these 
double-width ports at the proper distance effectively 
completes a second pair of hybrids.  The resulting device, 
resembling a cross with cross beams at the extremities has 
been christened the cross potent superhybrid.  The 
geometry is shown in Figure 3.

Power-flow arrows and an HP HFSS electric field plot illustrate four-way 
splitting function with power fed into port 1 (reverse for combining). 
 

 

Note that the four ports at the ends of the horizontal piece 
couple to the four ports at the ends of the vertical piece.  
This corresponds to a slightly different orientation of the 
hybrids in Figure 2 (albeit with the same connections) 
which circumvents the need to have one port connection 
cross over another, thus allowing planar symmetry to be 
maintained.  The four magic H’s which can be discerned in 
the cross potent superhybrid coalesce in such a way that the 
connected ports disappear entirely into the interiors of the 
neighboring hybrids, elegantly yielding a device which is 
more compact than the sum of its parts. 
 
The HP HFSS [9] electric field plot in Figure 3 illustrates 
the power direction for a wave entering the lower left port.

planes, can be written as follows:

Here SH is the scattering matrix of the simple hybrid.   
 
A cold-test model of the cross potent superhybrid has been 
built.  A waveguide height of 0.400” was used, and 90° 
curved bends were incorporated to simultaneously turn the 
ports outward and taper from the 0.721” port width to 
0.900”.  This allowed for easy testing with WR90 
connectors and loads.  Figure 4 shows the network analyzer 
results. S71, being by symmetry and reciprocity identical to 
S31, obscures the latter.  All isolations are better than 
−38.8 dB at the design frequency and remain below −20 dB 
over a bandwidth of ~200 MHz.  All couplings are within 
0.06 dB of an average of −6.07 dB, adjusted for the added 
bends.  Insertion loss is thus calculated to be ~0.05 dB. This 
device inherits all the advantages of the planar magic H 
hybrid, making it suitable for over-height fabrication for 
very high power applications. 

IV.  CONCLUSIONS 

In response to the problem of rf breakdown in multi-
hundred-megawatt X-band rf systems being developed for a 
next generation linear collider, we have conceived and 
designed a  rectangular waveguide, eight-port superhybrid, 
capable of serving as a 4x4 phased array, with a relatively 
open interior and a completely two-dimensional geometry.  
The latter feature makes its circuit properties independent 
of height, allowing for fabrication in over-height waveguide 
to minimize field strengths.

Measurements of a prototype were very satisfactory and in 
good agreement with simulation.  Field plots from the latter 
suggest that the maximum field in our X-band design can 
be limited to 50 MV/m at 600 MW with a waveguide height 
of 1.35”, whereas the same power in a magic T would yield 
surface fields exceeding 100 MV/m.  A prototype of a 
similar four-port hybrid performed quite well [5] at high 
power.  The simplicity of both these devices makes them 
attractive for low power use as well.

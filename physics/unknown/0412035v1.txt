Stable  ring  vortex  solitons,  featuring  a  bright-shape,  appear  to  be  very  rare  in  nature. 

However,  here  we  show  that  they  exist  and  can  be  made  dynamically  stable  in 

defocusing  cubic  nonlinear  media  with  an  imprinted  Bessel  optical  lattice. We  find  the 

families  of  vortex  lattice  solitons  and  reveal  their  salient  properties,  including  the 

conditions  required  for  their  stability.  We  show  that  the  higher  the  soliton  topological 

charge, the deeper the lattice modulation necessary for stabilization.

Vortex  solitons  with  a  bright  shape,  i.e.,  screw  topological  phase  dislocations 

embedded in a localized ring-shaped beam, might exist in different systems with focusing 

nonlinearities  [1].  However,  such  solitons  realize  higher-order,  excited  states  of  the 

corresponding  nonlinear  systems;  therefore  they  tend  to  be  highly  prone  to  azimuthal 

modulational 

instabilities  that 

lead  to  their  spontaneous  self-destruction 

into 

vorticityless  solitons  [2].  This  process  has  been  observed  experimentally  in  different 

settings [3], with the orbital angular momentum associated to the input vorticity being 

carried  away  by  the  soliton  fragments  that  fly  off  the  original  ring.  Homogeneous 

defocusing nonlinear media can support stable vortex solitons, but those have the form 

of  dark-shaped  beams,  i.e.,  dislocations  that  seat  on  a  background  which  extents  to 

infinity  along  the  transverse  direction  [4].  Localized,  stable  ring-vortex  solitons  in 

homogeneous media are only known to exist in models with competing cubic-quintic, or

quadratic-cubic  nonlinearities  [5,6].  Nevertheless,  such  models  are  very  challenging  to 

implement  in  practice,  as  they  would  require  very  large  light  intensities  where  the 

higher-order nonlinearities are typically accompanied by additional dominant processes, 

like multi-photon absorption [7]. A successful alternative is the use of confined systems, 

such  as  graded-index  optical  fibers  [8],  trapped  Bose-Einstein  condensates  [9],  or 

nonlinear photonic crystals with defects [10], where stabilization of the ring-shaped beam 

is induced by the corresponding trapping potentials. 

In this Letter we introduce a new approach to form stable nonlinear, ring-shaped 

vortices which is based on the concept of Bessel optical lattices. It is known that spatial 

modulation  of  the  refractive  index  profoundly  affects  soliton  properties  [11-13].  It  was 

demonstrated  recently  that  optical  lattices  with  flexibly  controlled  refractive  index 

modulation depth and period can be induced optically in photorefractive materials [14-

17].  To  date,  efforts  have  been  devoted  to  the  investigation  of  solitons  supported  by 

lattices  with  a  rectangular  or  honeycomb  symmetry  that  are  induced  by  intersecting 

plane waves [14-18]. However, Bessel lattices with a radial shape are also possible [19]. 

Here  we  address  Bessel  lattices  imprinted  in  defocusing  cubic  nonlinear  media  and 

uncover  the  properties  of  higher-order  excited  vortex  soliton  states  supported  by  the 

structure.  We  show  that  vortex  lattice  solitons  (VLS)  exist  in  these  lattices  and  that 

they  can  be  made  dynamically  stable  with  suitable  lattice  strength.  The  VLS  are  the 

nonlinear continuation of the lattice modes, but in contrast to such modes, VLS might 

extent over several lattice rings thus featuring a multi-ring bright shape.  

We  consider  light  propagation  along  the  z   axis  in  a  bulk  medium  with  the 

defocusing cubic nonlinearity and transverse modulation of refractive index described by 

nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the normalized complex field amplitude q :

,  where  φ   is  the  azimuthal 

angle.  Such  beams  can  be  created  experimentally  by  holographic  techniques  [20],  while 

vectorial  interactions  in  a  slow  Kerr-type  medium  (including,  e.g.  photorefractive 

crystals) can be utilized for trapping and guiding beams of orthogonal polarization in the 

lattice formed by the Bessel beam. We assume that the refractive index profile is given 

by  intensity  of  the  first-order  Bessel  beam  as  this  case  is  favorable  for  vortex  soliton 

formation  (see  Fig.  1(a)).  The  depth  of  refractive  index  modulation  is  assumed  to  be 

small,  i.e.,  of  the  order  of  the  nonlinear  contribution.  Eq.  (1)  requires  nonlinearities  of 

different  signs  for  soliton  and  lattice-creating  beams.  In  principle,  such  experimental 

conditions  can  be  met  in  the  photorefractive  semiconductor  crystals  such  as  GaAs:Cr, 

InP:Fe, and CdTe:In, belonging to the 

43m  point symmetry group [21]. These materials 

are  transparent  for  near  infrared  wavelengths,  exhibit  strong  photorefractivity  (e.g., 

3

n r =

 in CdTe:In) and the sign of nonlinearity might be changed by a  π

rotation  of  the  polarization  direction.  Notice  that  the  peak  value  of  photorefractive 

contribution  to  the  refractive  index  in  such  crystals  could  reach

  (that 

corresponds to

 in Eq. (1)) provided that sufficiently strong static electric field is 

applied.  Eq.  (1)  admits  several  conserved  quantities,  including  the  energy  flow

which we solved numerically. 

First we address the properties of the vorticityless solitons with zero topological 

charge 

m

0=

 (Fig. 1), which physically correspond to the nonlinear continuation of the 

lowest-order  mode  confined  by  the  lattice.  The  energy  flow  of  such  solitons  is  a 

monotonically  decreasing  function  of  the  propagation  constant  (Fig.  1(b)).  The  energy 

flow  goes  to  infinity  at  b

0→

  and  vanishes  at  the  upper  cutoff  b   of  the  propagation 

co

constant.  Since  the  lattice  profile  has  a  local  minimum  at  r

=

0

,  vorticityless  solitons 

have a small intensity dip on their top (Fig. 1(c)). At small power levels, when b

→

cob

, 

vorticityless solitons transform into linear modes guided by the first lattice ring, while at 

b →

0

 where defocusing nonlinearity dominates the soliton diameter grows and it covers 

several  lattice  rings.  As  b

0→

  the  soliton  diameter  increases  dramatically  while  its 

maximal  amplitude  remains  almost  unchanged.  The  area  of  existence  of  vorticityless 

solitons broadens monotonically with growth of lattice depth (inset in Fig. 1(c)). Linear 

stability  analysis  revealed  that  vorticityless  solitons  solutions  are  stable  in  the  entire 

domain of their existence, as expected on physical grounds. To confirm the results of the 

linear stability analysis we performed extensive numerical simulations using Eq. (1) with 

the perturbed input conditions

We  now  consider  VLS  with  topological  charge  m

1=

  (Fig.  2).  Note  that  such 

lattice  solitons,  as  well  as  the  vorticityless  ones,  exist  because  defocusing  nonlinearity 

and  diffraction  are  balanced  by  the  lattice  that  focuses  radiation  into  the  region  with 

higher refractive index. Therefore, the Bessel lattice affords confinement of light that is 

impossible  in  a  uniform  defocusing  medium.  The  energy  flow  of  the  VLS  is  a 

monotonically  decreasing  function  of  the  propagation  constant  (Fig.  2(a)).  There  exist 

zero  lower  and  positive  upper  cutoffs  on  the  propagation  constant.  The  energy  flow  of 

the  VLS  diverges  as  b

0→

  and  vanishes  as  b   approaches  the  upper  cutoff  b .  With 

co

increase of the energy flow, the VLS get wider and cover many lattice rings (Fig. 2(b)). 

The existence domain of VLS with unit topological charge is displayed in Fig. 2(c). The 

width of the existence domain increases monotonically with growth of the lattice depth. 

Notice that at fixed lattice depth 

p

, the width of the existence domain on propagation 

constant reaches its maximal value for vorticityless solitons and decreases with growth of 

the soliton topological charge. 

The  central  result  of  this  Letter  is  that  the  VLS  become  dynamically  stable  in 

suitable domains of their existence. This is depicted in Fig. 2(c). In the plot we show the 

n
critical  value  of  propagation  constant  b   above  which  no  perturbations  with  the 
cr

azimuthal  index  n   and  nonzero  real  part  of  growth  rate  were  found.  Notice  that  the 

precise  structure  of  instability  regions  (shaded  area  in  Fig.  2(c))  is  quite  complicated. 

There exist multiple narrow stability “windows” near the upper cutoff even for shallow 

lattices,  but  we  do  not  show  them  here  because  stabilization  close  to  the  upper  cutoff 

(where  soliton  transforms  into  the  linear  mode  guided  by  first  lattice  ring)  is  not 

surprising. Our simulations indicate that VLS with  m

1=

 from the shaded area in Fig. 

2(c) self-destroy under the action of perturbation with the azimuthal index 

n =

1

, while 

the  corresponding  instability  is  of  a  oscillatory  type  with  Re

δ (cid:19)
( )

Im(

)δ

.  Typically 

decay of the unstable vortices in Bessel lattice occurs at hundreds of propagation units. 

Decay  of  the  unstable  VLS  either  produces  diffracting  radiation  or  sets  of  vorticityless 

solitons.  We  found  that  when  the  lattice  depth  exceeds  a  critical  value,  of  about 

p ≈
cr

12.9

,  the  instability  regions  cease  to  exist  and  VLS  become  stable  in  the  entire 

domain of their existence. The stable propagation of a vortex lattice soliton with  m

1=

 

in the presence of broadband input noise is illustrated in Fig. 2(d). To illustrate that the 

defocusing nonlinearity is a necessary ingredient for the existence of the stable VLS, Fig. 

 

5

3  shows  the  three-dimensional  shapes  of  different  VLS  together  with  the  linear  mode 

supported  by  the  lattice.  Notice  the  differences  in  beam  profile  introduced  by  the 

defocusing  nonlinearity,  in  particular  the  multi-ring  structure  acquired  by  the  VLS  at 

moderate and high energy flows. 

Vortex  lattice  solitons  with  topological  charge  m

2=

  were  also  studied.  Their 

properties  have  much  in  common  with  properties  of  solitons  with  m

1=

  and  are 

summarized in Fig. 4. The instability domain is located near lower cutoff on propagation 

constant. It also has complex structure with separate stability “windows” (not shown at 

the plot), and its width decreases monotonically with growth of the lattice depth. Notice 

that vortices from shaded area in Fig. 4(c) are affected by perturbations with azimuthal 

indexes 

n =

1,2

,  which  indicates  that  spectrum  of  harmful  perturbations  enriches  with 

growth of the vortex topological charge. However, the important result uncovered is that 

for deep enough lattices a broad stability domain appears too, as shown in Fig. 4(c). An 

illustrative example of the propagation of a stable ring-shaped vortex soliton with m

2=

 

is  presented  in  Fig.  4(d).  We  considered  also  vortex  solitons  with  higher  topological 

charges and found stability conditions. Consistent with intuitive expectations, a general 

conclusion  can  be  drawn  that  the  higher  is  the  topological  charge  of  the  vortex  the 

deeper  is  the  lattice  required  for  its  stabilization.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  we  also 

found higher-order “twisted” vortex and vorticityless modes whose field 

( )w r

 alternates 

on successive lattice rings, but their stability analysis is beyond the scope of this Letter. 

Finally,  we  also  studied  VLS  in  Bessel  lattices  imprinted  in  focusing  nonlinear  media, 

but we found them all to be unstable against azimuthal modulational instabilities. 

To summarize, we stress that optical lattices induced by nondiffracting first-order 

Bessel  beam  in  media  with  defocusing  nonlinearity  have  been  shown  to  be  able  to 

support  stable  vorticityless  and  also  stable  multi-ring  vortex  solitons.  The  predicted 

existence  of  the  bright-shaped  vortex  lattice  solitons,  which  do  not  self-destroy  by 

azimuthal  modulational  instabilities,  is  a  rare  phenomenon  in  physics  and  it  is  an 

important  example  of  the  unique  phenomena  afforded  by  Bessel  optical  lattices.  The 

results  reported  are  relevant  not  only  for  nonlinear  optics  but  also  for  suitable  Bose-

Einstein condensates trapped in Bessel lattices with repulsive interatomic interactions.

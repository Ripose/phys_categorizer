Abstract

We generalize the method of obtaining such fundamental linear partial dif-

ferential equations as the diﬀusion and Schr¨odinger equation, Dirac and tele-

grapher’s equation from a simple stochastic consideration to arrive at certain

nonlinear form of these equations. The group classiﬁcation through one pa-

rameter group of transformation for two of these equations is also carried

out.

I. INTRODUCTION

It is remarkable that some of the fundamental linear equations of physics such as the

diﬀusion and Schr¨odinger equations, Dirac and telegrapher’s equations, and the Maxwell

equations can be obtained by setting up a master equation from simple stochastic consider-

ations and a modiﬁcation there of [1–3].

Hosts of nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations have been vigorously studied in recent

times for possessing interesting solitonic, self focussing and allied properties in ﬁelds wide

ranging from lasers to string theories. It is interesting to note, as it is shown in classical

mechanics with randomness playing a key role, that any arbitrary initial distribution of

velocities must eventually become Maxwellian. Thus the Maxwellian distribution must be

invariant under the underlying stochastic process [4]. The system tending to and remaining

in Maxwellian distribution is analogous to the self focussing in nonlinear optics and the

properties of solitonic systems arising in nonlinear phenomena.

The transition to nonlinear equation from a linear equation through certain transforma-

tions is well known. An example is the Cole-Hopf transformation that carries over the linear

diﬀusion equation to the nonlinear Burgers equation. The reverse process of getting linear
diﬀusion equation from a nonlinear diﬀusion equation in the form ∂φ

∂t = v2 ∂2φ

∂v2 has also been

studied [8,9] through a nonlinear transformation.

In this paper, we propose to obtain a class of nonlinear equations in a diﬀerent way by

generalizing the method of [1]. The method is simple. The basic inputs can be incorporated

from considerations and arguments based on physical reasoning to obtain nonlinear equations

rather than arbitrary mathematical transformations. The form of the equations obtained

are quite restrictive. However, we do not address the deep mathematical signiﬁcance of

Cole-Hopf transformation and the like in this method.

In section II, we brieﬂy review the method used in setting up some basic linear equations

of physics. Then we generalize the procedure of obtaining classes of correspondng nonlinear

partial diﬀerential equations in section III. Next, section IV is devoted to the construction

of the groups under which two of the equations obtained in section II, namely diﬀusion

equation with nonlinearity and nonlinear telegrapher’s equation, remain invariant. The

similarity transformation and the Lie algebra are constructed to show the transformations

under which solutions go over to new solutions.

II. LINEAR EQUATIONS

The fundamental role of linear diﬀusion equation in Physics and its applications in other

branches hardly needs any elaboration. An analytic continuation turns this equation into

Schr¨odinger equation. Another basic equation of physics, the Dirac equation originated in

the attempt to make Schr¨odinger equation compatible with special theory of relativity. It

is a simple matter to arrive at telegrapher’s equation by iterating Dirac equation in (1 + 1)

dimensions. It is a curiuos fact that these equations have been obtained by Gaveau etal [1]

and Ord [2] from stochastic consideration by setting up a master equation. Ord [3] has also

arrived at the Maxwell equation by a modiﬁcation of the master equation.

Following [1–3] we brieﬂy review how these equations are achieved and then proceed to

nonlinear generalization. The basic consideration is the correlation over a random ensemble

of particles. However, for simpler visualization we may follow the Boltzmann approach by

analysing the movement of a single particle. Let a particle have random motion in one space

dimension moving with a ﬁxed speed v. We assume that it has complete reversal of direction

of motion in a random manner from time to time, say as to ﬂip of a coin. So this is according

to Poisson distribution, that is to say that there is a ﬁxed rate a for this reversal and the

probability for reversal in a time interval dt is adt. Let P+(x, t) (respectively, P−(x, t)) be the

probability density for the particle being at x at time t and moving to the right (respectively

left). The master equation for an inﬁnitesimal time step is

P±(x, t + ∆t) = P±(x ∓ ∆x, t)(1 − a∆t) + P∓(x ± ∆x, t)a∆t

(1)

This equation gives rise to the linear equations such as Dirac, telegrapher’s, diﬀusion or

Schr¨odinger equations in the lowest approximation under various circumstances.

To the lowest order in ∆x and ∆t, equation (1) gives,

∂P±
∂t

= −a(P± − P∓) ∓ v

∂P±
∂x

,

v =

∆x
∆t

.

(2)

and the telegrapher’s equation follows by iteration,

∂x2 = −2a
The one dimensional Dirac equation is obtained from (1) by analytic continuation. First

In the Feynman path integral formulation through checkers moves on space-time, 1 has

to be replaced by a factor 1 + ( imc2
whereas for reversals there is a factor −i∆t mc2
¯h .
The Dirac equation in (1 + 1) dimensions, having two components, has the similar time

and space dependence in this stochastic approach. But for a single component object we

ﬁnd that the linear diﬀusion equation results, which shows the asymmetry in derivatives

arising out of the random walk problem.

A generalization to three space dimensions has been carried out in [1].

McKeon and Ord [5] have shown that if movements backward and forward in time is

superposed as well on the previous motion, then Dirac equation in one dimension results

without recourse to direct analytic continuation.

To arrive at the linear diﬀusion equation in a simple way, we put P± = P∓ = P , and

a = 1

2∆t . The master equation (1) reduces to

P (x, t + ∆t) =

P (x − ∆x, t) +

P (x + ∆x, t).

Expanding this in a Taylor series about the point (x, t) gives,

It may be noted that the above equation in the context of Brownian motion can be

obtained from a consideration of one dimensional random walk with a Bernoulli distribution

of probability and the statistical considerations sets [4]

A formal analytic continuation (e. g. t → it, or D → i¯h) leads to Schr¨odinger equation.

Ord [3] has obtained the Maxwell equations by a modiﬁcation of the master equation.

We follow his procedure to show how it is done. First equation (1) is modiﬁed to,

P±(x, t + ∆t) = P±(x ∓ ∆x, t) + a(x, t)∆t

where, a(x, t) is interpreted as a source and linear combinations of P+ and P− will correspond

to the potentials A(x, t) and Φ(x, t). To the lowest order in ∆x and ∆t equation (9) gives,

Writing,

equation (10) implies,

and the second with respect to x to give ,

Equations (10) and (11) may be decoupled by diﬀerentiating the ﬁrst with respect to t

and similarly we get,

∂2A(x, t)

= c2 ∂2A(x, t)

Equations (13), (14), and (15) are equivalent to Maxwell equations in (1 + 1) dimensions,

equation (13) being the Lorentz condition

(18)

(19)

(20)

(21)

which is the equation of continuity. These considerations may be generalized to three space

dimensions.

The objective of the above long review is to stress the interesting fact that many of the

fundamental linear equations of physics are obtainable from an elementary consideration of

stochastic process. Of course, by no stretch of imagination, we may expect the whole of

physics to follow from such a consideration.

III. NONLINEAR EQUATIONS

Nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations appear in all branches of physics and some of

these have interesting properties such as soliton like solutions, inﬁnite number of conserved

objects and so on. The nonlinear diﬀusion equation in the form (in our notation)

∂P (x, t)
∂t

=

∂
∂x "

f (p)

∂P (x, t)
∂x

#

(22)

is well known in literature [6–10] and the properties of its solutions have been extensively

studied.

Now we proceed with an aim at getting the above nonlinear equation and others out of the

master equation (1), by suitable modiﬁcations. If we consider this to be a phenomenological

equation, without any recourse to Poisson’s distribution, then the obvious way to introduce

nonlinearity is to introduce functions of x and t as multiplicative coeﬃcients on right hand

side of equation (1). As an example, suppose we apply randomness to ∆x itself. We know

that if α is chosen at random in the interval (0, 1) then the probability of αn to be in the

interval (x, x + dx) is given by

∆x
(1+x) log 2
instead of ∆x in equation (5), which is a special case of equation (1). Perhaps it would be

(1+x) log 2 for large n, and hence a possibility is to use

dx

simplest to replace ∆x by P (x, t)∆x in (5), and the resulting equation is

where

∂P (x, t)
∂t

= DP 2(x, t)

∂2P (x, t)
∂x2

D =

(∆x)2
∆t

.

∂P (x, t)
∂t

= DP (x, t)

∂2P (x, t)
∂x2

,

Or else, we may treat x and t in the same footing, that is set ∆t → P (x, t)∆t and ∆x →

P (x, t)∆x instead of only ∆x → P (x, t)∆x and we get,

both equations (23) and (25) being nonlinear equations. Henceforth we set D = 1.

It should be noted that this does not mean any nonlinear equation can be obtained this

way. The condition that for ∆t = 0 , ∆x = 0 both left and right side of equation (1) must

match is quite a restriction. However, by making use of equation (7) one may get many

more equations by setting the source term as function of x, P and its derivatives or their

combinations. This would be analogous to adding terms to the Lagrangian arbitrarily in the

conventional method of getting equations of motion.

It is an interesting fact that if the master equation (1) is modiﬁed in the ﬁrst term of

right hand side in the following way

P±(x, t + ∆t) = P±(x ∓ ∆x, t)(1 − P+∆t) + P∓(x ± ∆x, t)a∆t

(26)

we get a nonlinear form of the Dirac equation in one space dimension,

∂P+
∂t
∂P−
∂t

= −P 2

+ − v

+ aP−

∂P+
∂x

= −aP− + aP+ + v

∂P−
∂x

and by iteration a nonlinear analogue of telegraphers’ equation results,

∂2P+
∂t2

− v2 ∂2P+

∂x2 = −aP 2

+ − (2P+ + a)(

∂P+
∂t

− v

∂P+
∂x

).

(23)

(24)

(25)

(27)

(28)

(29)

Further generalizations would be to consider P as a complex multi- component object

and readers may amuse themselves by putting objects such as supersymmetric variables,

Pauli and other matrices etc. as coeﬃcients of ∆x in equation (1).

IV. GROUP ANALYSIS

Before we analyze the nonlinear equation (23) or (25) we would like to emphasize the

important developments regarding the linear diﬀusion equation (7). It is well known that

this equation goes over to Burgers equation under the Cole-Hopf transformation. Burgers

equation and similar integrable ones have been much studied in recent decades for their

importance in physical sciences for the existence of soliton like behaviour, inﬁnite num-

ber of conservation laws as well as for their deep mathematical connections to B¨acklund

transformations, conformal invariance and so on.

Equations of the form (23) have been analysed by Munier etal [8] and by Hill [9] in detail.

It is found that the nonlinear diﬀusion equation of the form

are equivalent to the classical diﬀusion equation for P ,

if we introduce x such that

and every nonlinear diﬀusion equation of the form

∂ψ
∂t

= ψ2 ∂2ψ
∂P 2

∂P
∂t

=

∂2P

ψ(P, t) ≡

f (P )

f (P )

can be transformed to the following equation with a simpler nonlinearity

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

where ψ(P, t) is the ﬂux associated with equation (33). Hence, for this special case the

analysis would be similar to that of the linear diﬀusion equation.

However, in general the simplest nonlinear equation we would get from the master equa-

tion by replacing ∆x → f (P )∆x in equation (5) would be,

∂P
∂t

= f 2(P )

∂2P
∂x2

∂P
∂t

= f (P )

∂2P
∂x2

as in equation (23) or

as in equation (25).

Now we proceed to analyse the properties of the solutions of (35) by means of one param-

eter groups as in [6–10]. For the single dependent variable P and for the two independent

variables x and t we have one parameter groups of the form,

x1 = f (x, t, P, ǫ) = x + ǫξ(x, t, P ) + O(ǫ2),

t1 = g(x, t, P, ǫ) = t + ǫη(x, t, P ) + O(ǫ2),

P1 = h(x, t, P, ǫ) = P + ǫζ(x, t, P ) + O(ǫ2).

We follow the standard procedure [9,10] to obtain the similarity variable and functional form

of the solution by solving the ﬁrst order partial diﬀerential equation

for known functions ξ(x, t, P ), η(x, t, P ) and ζ(x, t, P ). Let

be a vector ﬁeld on the space X×U (2), where coordinates represent the independent variables,

the dependent variables and the derivatives of the dependent variables up to order 2. All

possible coeﬃcient functions ξ, η, ζ are to be determined so that the one parameter group

exp(ǫv), thus obtained would be the symmetry group of the nonlinear equations (35) for the

diﬀusion case and (29) for telegrapher’s case.

The determining equation for the symmetry group for the diﬀusion with non linearity,

equation (35) is

If equation (45) holds, then from (h) and

The solutions are given by,

ξ(x, t, P+) = κ + λvx + λv2t,

η(x, t, P+) = τ + λx + λvt,

ζ(x, t, P+) = 0,

(69)

where, κ, λ, and τ are arbitrary constants and the inﬁnitesimal symmetries are spanned by

the four vector ﬁelds

v1 =

∂x

space translation,

time translation,

dilatation,

v2 =

with the commutation relations,

hyperbolic ”rotation” in x, t space,

(70)

[v1, v2] = [v3, v4] = 0,

[v1, v4] = [v2, v3] = v2,

[v1, v3] = v1,

[v2, v4] = v2v1

(71)

The one parameter groups Gi generated by the vi are,

G1 : (x + ǫ, t, P+),

G2 : (x, t + ǫ, P+),

G3 : (eǫx, eǫt, P+),

P+1 = z(x − ǫ, t),

P+2 = z(x, t − ǫ),

P+3 = z(e−ǫx, eǫt),

G4 : (x + v2ǫt, t + ǫx, P+).

(72)

This implies that if P+ = z(x, t) is a solution to equation (29), so are the functions

P+4 = z(x − v2ǫt, t − ǫx),

(73)

where ǫ is any real number.

V. CONCLUSION

The main objective of this paper was to extend the method of deducing some fundamental

linear partial diﬀerential equations of physics from a consideration of stochastic arguments

to the nonlinear case. We saw that this could be achieved in a very simple way by modifying

the master equation to obtain ”nonlinear diﬀusion” equation, nonlinear Dirac equation in 1

+ 1 dimensions and the corresponding telegrapher’s equation. As a preliminary step towards

the analysis of the properties of the solutions, we have considered the group classiﬁcation

problem of the ﬁrst and the last one by means of one parameter groups. The inﬁnitesimal

symmetry group of the nonlinear telegrapher’s equation is spanned by a vector ﬁeld corre-

sponding to a ”hyperbolic rotation” of x and t. For our type of diﬀusion equation, though

the group structure is similar to that of standard nonlinear diﬀusion equation, the ordinary

diﬀerential equations obtained is diﬀerent and the results are similar when m = 4 in our
case, but m = − 4
3 in the standard case (m being the highest power of the dependent variable
in coeﬃcient to the ∂2
∂x2 term in the nonlinear diﬀusion equation). The physical applications
of this equation has been widely studied in the context of gas dynamics and plasma physics

etc. We expect the other two equations to have similar important applications in physics

with rich mathematical structure and we leave it for future study.

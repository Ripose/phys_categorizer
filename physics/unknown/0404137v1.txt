Abstract 

An idea of producing a focused parametric X-ray radiation (PXR) is presented. The PXR 
is emitted by relativistic charged particles channeling along a bent crystal. Then the PXR emitted 
from the whole length of the bent crystal is going to the focus. Some properties of focused PXR 
are  estimated  for  typical  experimental  conditions  and  possible  applications  are  discussed.  The 
experiment for observation of focused PXR is proposed.

Introduction 
 
A possibility of steering charged particles motion by a bent crystal has first 
been  predicted  in  Ref.  [1].  The  steering  can  be  realized  for  particles  which  are 
traveling through a long bent crystal in the channeling regime [2]. The channeling 
particles may be deflected, if the crystal is bent smoothly enough. Experiments on 
proton  beam  deflection,  focusing  and  extraction  [3]  by  bent  crystals  have  been 
performed, e.g., in Serpukhov at 70 GeV [4, 5], CERN at 120 GeV [6] and at 450 
GeV  [7,8],  Fermilab  at  900  GeV  [9].  The  steering  of  positive  particles  at  planar 
channeling  is  most  effective  (see,  e.g.,  [7]).  Bent  crystals  of  about  several 
centimeters in length are generally used in the experiments. These crystals seem to 
be  convenient  for  production  of  focused  parametric  X-ray  radiation  (PXR)  by 
channeling relativistic particles.  

Experimental  studies  of  PXR  from  relativistic  electrons  moving  through  a 
thin  crystal  have  been  performed  since  1985  to  gain  an  insight  into  the  PXR 
properties  and  to  develop  a  new  source  of  quasimonochromatic  polarized  X-ray 
beam.  The  PXR  has  its  maximum  intensity  in  the  vicinity  of  Bragg  direction 
relative  to  the  crystallographic  plane  (PXR  reflection).  The  PXR  reflection  from 
crystals was observed and studied at electron beam energies ranging from several 
MeV  to  several  GeV,  and  at  PXR  energies  from  a  few  keV  to  hundreds  of  keV. 
The validity of kinematical theory [10] for the description of PXR properties has 
been demonstrated in the most of related publications. General information about 
the  nature,  properties  and  investigations  of  the  PXR,  as  well  as  references  to 
original  papers  can  be  found,  e.g.,  in  reviews  [11-14].  The  experiment  on 
observation  of  PXR  from  protons  has  been  described  in  Ref.  [15].  However,  the 

 

2 

PXR from particles channeling in a bent crystal has not been studied as yet, so far 
as we know. 

Crystals  usually  have  a  number  of  crystallographic  planes  aligned  at 
different  directions.  Therefore,  relativistic  particles  emit  a  number  of  PXR 
reflections  at  Bragg  directions  relative  to  these  crystallographic  planes  (see,  e.g. 
[16]).  In  the  present  paper  we  will  show  a  possibility  of  focusing  the  PXR 
generated  in  a  bent  crystal  by  channeling  particles  and  consider  some  of  its 
properties. The experiment for observation of focused PXR is also proposed. 

 
How to focus PXR 
 
Let  us  suppose  that  relativistic  charged  particles  are  moving  in  the 
channeling regime along a bent crystalline plate, as it is shown in Fig. 1. The bent 
crystal is cylindrical in shape,  R  being the radius, and  f is the axis of the cylinder. 
The  particles  are  channeling  along  the  crystallographic  planes  denoted  by  the 
!
.  In  this  paper  we  will  consider  PXR  reflections  from 
reciprocal  lattice  vector  g
crystallographic  planes  aligned  at  45"   relative  to  the  particle  trajectory  and 
perpendicular to the plane of Fig. 1a. These crystallographic planes are denoted by 
. The PXR reflections from these planes are 
the reciprocal lattice vectors 
going  perpendicularly  to  the  particle  trajectory  and  the  crystalline  plate  surface.

collected (focused) at the axis  f .

 The  properties  of  the  PXR  reflection  generated  at  the  right  angle  to  the 
particle beam in thin crystals have been studied in several papers. The image of the 
whole PXR reflection at the right angle to the particle beam was first observed in 
Ref.  [17],  its  polarization  was  considered  in  [18]  and  a  detailed  structure  of  the 
yield angular distribution was studied in [19]. The shape of angular distribution of 
the yield may be found, e.g., in figures of Refs. [17, 19, 14]. The shape of angular 
distribution of linear polarization directions in the PXR reflection at the right angle 
to  the  particle  trajectory  may  be  found,  e.g.,  in  figures  of  Refs.  [18,14].  The 
angular  distribution  of  the  PXR  yield  in  the  reflection  at  the  right  angle  to  the 
particle trajectory has two maxima in the plane of Fig. 1b. Therefore the PXR will 
be  focused  at two points 
2F   at  the  axis  f   at  an  angular  distance of  about 
γ−  one from another. Here, 
γ  is the effective relativistic factor in the medium

χ   is

vicinity of points 
2F . The linear polarization direction is practically in the 
plane of Fig. 1b. Thus, the focused PXR is linearly polarized in the plane of Fig. 
1b.

Apart  from  the  PXR  emission,  the particles  moving through  the  crystalline 
plate  ionize  crystal  atoms  and  thus  make  them  emit  the  characteristic  X-ray 
1F  
radiation (CXR). The CXR is isotropic and not focused, but it exists at points 
and 

2F , too.

Estimations of some properties of focused PXR 
 
To  understand  the  main  features  of  focused  PXR,  let  us  estimate  them  for 
typical experimental conditions. As an example, we performed calculations for 450 
GeV protons channeling along the crystallographic plane (110) with the reciprocal 
!
g =<
lattice  vector 
  (see  Fig.  1)  in  the  Si  single-crystal  plate,  0.5  mm  in 
1 10
= 5  cm  in  length,  with  the  curvature  radius  R = 5  m.  The  PXR 
thickness  and  cryst
l
reflections under consideration are generated at crystallographic planes parallel to 
. The 
the ones denoted by the reciprocal lattice vectors 
calculations were performed using formulae from Refs. [12, 14, 20] derived within 
the framework of the Ter-Mikaelian theory [10]. The focused PXR reflections are 
2F   from  the  crystallographic  planes  having  a  nonzero 
going  to  the  points 
structure  factor  parallel  to  (100),  these  are  (400),  (800),  (12  00).  The  PXR 
reflections  from  higher-index  planes  have  substantially  lower  yields.  The  PXR 
reflections from similar crystallographic planes, that are parallel to  (0 10) , are going 
in opposite directions from the axis  f . The particular case of channeling radiation 
diffraction [21] is not considered in the present estimations.

The  crystallographic  axis 

>   is  aligned  along  the  proton  beam  in  the 
above-considered example. To avoid axial channeling in the experiment, one needs 
to provide misalignment of the crystal lattice in the (110) plane for a small angle,  
which  is  somewhat  larger  than  the  critical  channeling  angle.  The  critical 
channeling angle for the Si single crystal at a proton energy of 450 GeV is about 
510−  radian [2]. The main features of PXR emission, the positions of points 
2F  
and  the  properties  of  focused  PXR  will  change  insignificantly  at  such  a  small 
misalignment. 

1F , 

The  PXR  properties  are  functions  of  the  relativistic  factor  of  the  incident 
particle and the absolute value of particle charge [10,12,20]. Therefore, the results 
of present calculations might be valid for 245 MeV positrons and electrons, which 
have the same relativistic factor. However, the motion of these particles in a long 
crystal  can  differ  from  the  motion  of  protons.  For  example,  a  significant  part  of 
high-energy protons can move through a long bent crystal in the channeling regime 
[2,4-9]. But electrons strongly scatter at channeling. So far as we know, there have 
been no publications about experimental research on the channeling of positrons in 
bent crystals and on generation of PXR by positrons in any crystals. 

Besides, the yield of CXR at 1.74 keV due to K-shell ionization of Si atoms 
by 450 GeV protons was estimated in accordance with the recommendations from 
Ref. [22]. In the calculations, the K-shell ionization cross section for Si atoms was 
taken  to  be  1943  barn.  This  cross  section  value  was  calculated  for  245  MeV 
electrons having the same relativistic factor as that of 450 GeV protons. The effect 

 

4 

of channeling was not taken into account in the present estimations of CXR yield, 
as  it  is  not  expected  to  be  very  significant  at  high  particle  energies  (see  Refs.  in 
[22]). 

The calculations were performed for a uniform distribution of protons in the 
crystalline plate thickness. The radiation excited by channeling protons is going to 
2F   across  the  plate,  and  is  attenuated  by  the  Si  crystal.  The 
points 
attenuation of radiation in the plate was taken into account in the calculations.

Results and discussion 
 

1F  and 

The results of calculations are presented in Table 1. The spectrum of X-ray 
radiation at points 
2F  has four spectral peaks in the 1.7 – 19.4 keV energy 
range,  this  being  convenient  for  registration  by  standard  X-ray  spectrometric 
detectors. The peak at 1.74 keV is due to a non-focused non-polarized CXR, which 
is produced mainly by protons moving in a 13.3  mµ  layer at a concave side of the 
plate. This layer thickness is determined by X-ray attenuation in a Si crystal (see 
Table 1). Thus, only a little part of the total number of protons passing through the 
2F . The other spectral peaks 
plate produces the CXR that reaches the points 
are  due  to  a  focused  polarized  PXR.  The  spectral  peaks  of  focused  PXR  at 
E = 6.46, 12.91, 19.37 keV are produced mainly by protons moving in the 37  mµ  
layer  at  a  concave  side  of  the  plate,  in  the  270  mµ   layer  at  the  same  side  of  the 
plate, and in almost the whole crystalline plate thickness respectively. 

1F  and 

The radiation sources for different spectral peaks are specifically distributed 
in  the  crystal  thickness.  Therefore,  the  measurements  and  analysis  of  relative 
intensities  of  spectral  peaks  would  permit  the  estimation  of  beam  proton 
distribution  in  the  crystal  thickness.  This  can  be  done  for  the  whole  crystalline 
plate or for its separate part, provided that other parts of the plate are screened, and 
the X-ray detector can see only this separate part of the crystal. The CXR from the 
13.3  mµ  layer at a convex side of the bent crystal may be registered by an X-ray 
detector  installed  opposite  to  a  convex  side  of  the  bent  crystal,  as  the  CXR  is 
isotropic and non-focused. 

Angular  divergence  (convergence)  of  focused  PXR  may  be  controlled  by 
changing  the  radius  of  curvature  R   of  the  bent  crystal.  Thus,  we  have  an  X-ray 
source  of  several  centimeters  in  size,  with  a  provided  smooth  tuning  of  the 
divergence (convergence). This monochromatic source of polarized X-rays with a 
possibility of smooth tuning of divergence may be useful for calibration of large-
aperture  X-ray  equipment,  for  example,  X-ray  space  telescopes  [16].  The 

divergence  (convergence)  of  PXR  reflections  from  channeling particles is  cryst
R

  at 

l

the plane of Fig. 1a. 

The focused PXR generated by channeling positive relativistic particles in a 
long  crystal can provide  a  natural  PXR  spectral peak  of  extremely  narrow  width. 
The  natural  spectral  peak  width  of  focused  PXR  may  be  of  microelectronvolts 
range at PXR spectral peak energy of about 10 keV [23].

The  experiment  on  observation  of  focused  PXR  may  be  performed  at  a 
facility  with  a  crystal  bent  for  steering  the  proton  beam  having  the  channeling 
p .  It  can  be  seen  from  Table  1  that  all 
s

particles  intensity  of  about  or  above 

710

1F  or 

intensities,  and 

thus,  can  be  measured 
spectral  peaks  have  comparable 
simultaneously by a spectrometric X-ray detector. The X-ray detector, being about 
1 cm2 square, should be installed at point 
2F  at the axis  f . The PXR from 
non-channeled particles can be rejected by registering X-rays in coincidence with 
the  particles  that  have  passed  through  the  bent  crystal  in  the  channeling  regime. 
There  should  be  vacuum  connection  between  the  bent  crystal  and  the  X-ray 
detector in order to observe soft X-rays, because of their attenuation in air. X-rays 
of energies 1.74 and 6.46 will be absorbed practically completely over a distance 
of 5 m in air. However, observation of higher-energy focused PXR is possible in 
air.  The  X-rays  of  energies  12.91 and 19.37  keV  will be  attenuated  by  factors of 
about 0.23 and 0.60, respectively, at 5 m in air. The energies of all spectral peaks 
are  practically  independent  of  incident  relativistic  particle  energy.  Yet,  their 
intensities can increase (decrease) with an increasing (decreasing) incident proton 
energy [12,20].

Introduction
It is one hundred years since Einstein formulated his postulates for the invariant
property of light, namely that the speed of light is always c (≈300,000 km/s) for
any uniformly moving observer, which is equivalent to the assertion that  there
is no preferred frame, that there is no detectable space, that a three-dimensional
space has no physical existence.

Einstein postulates:
(1) The laws of physics have the same form in all inertial reference
frames.
(2) Light propagates through empty space with a definite speed c inde-
pendent of the speed of the observer  (or source).
(3) In the limit of low speeds the gravity formalism should agree with
Newtonian gravity.

The putative successes of the postulates lead to the almost universal acceptance
of the Einstein Special Theory of Relativity, which is based upon the concept of
a flat spacetime ontology that replaces the older separate concepts of space and

time, and then to the General  Theory  of  Relativity  with  its  curved  spacetime
model  for  gravity.  While  the  relativistic  effects  are  well  established  experi-
mentally it is now belatedly understood, in 2002 [4,10], that numerous experi-
ments, beginning with the Michelson-Morley experiment [1] of 1887, have al-
ways  shown  that    postulates  (1)  and  (2)  (excepting  the  2nd  part)  are  false,
namely that there is a detectable local frame of reference or `space', and that the
solar system has a large observed galactic velocity of some 420±30km/s in the
direction (RA=5.2hr, Dec= -67deg) through this space [2,3,5,8,10]. This is dif-
ferent from the speed of 369km/s in the direction (RA=11.20hr, Dec= -7.22deg)
extracted  from  the  Cosmic  Microwave  Background  (CMB)  anisotropy,  and
which describes a motion relative to the distant universe, but not relative to the
local space. This critique briefly reviews the experimental evidence regarding
the failure of the postulates, and the implications for our understanding of fun-
damental  physics,  and  in  particular  for  our  understanding  of  gravity.    A  new
theory of gravity is seen to be necessary, and this results in an explanation of
the `dark matter' effect, entailing the discovery that the fine structure constant is
a  2nd  gravitational  constant  [1-4].  This  theory  is  a  part  of  the  information-
theoretic  modelling  of  reality  known  as Process Physics  [2-4,9], which prem-
ises  a  non-geometric  process  model  of  time,  as  distinct  from  the  current non-
Process Physics, which is characterised by a geometrical model of time.

100 years of Detecting Absolute Motion
The  whole  business  of  detecting  absolute  motion  (motion  relative  to  space  it-
self)  and  so  a  preferred  local  frame  of  reference,  came  undone  from  the  very
beginning.

Fig.1  Azimuth  ψ  (deg),  meas-
ured  from  south,  from  the
Miller [5] data, plotted against
local  sidereal 
time.  Plots
crosses  the  local  meridian  at
approx.  5hr  and  17hr.  The
monthly changes arise from the
orbital  motion  of  the  earth
about the sun.  Miller used that
effect to determine the value of
k in (1), and now in agreement
with  the  refractive  index  the-
ory,  see  [2,3,4].  Curves  from
theory [2,4].

Fig.2 DeWitte 1991 RF travel-time variations, in
ns,  in  a  1.5km  NS  coaxial  cable,  measured  with
atomic clocks, over three days plotted against lo-
cal sidereal time, showing  that at approximately
5hr  and  17hr  the  effect  is  largest.    This  remark-
able agreement with the Miller interferometer ex-
periment  shows  that  the  detection  of  absolute
motion is one of the great suppressed discoveries
in  physics.  At  least  five  other  interferometer  or
coaxial  cable  experiments  are  consistent  with
these observations [2-4].

The Einstein Postulates: 1905-2005

The Michelson and Morley air-mode interferometer fringe shift data revealed a
speed  of  some  8km/s  [4,10]  when  analysed  using  the  prevailing  Newtonian
≈   in  (1),  where ∆t is  the  difference  between  the
theory,  which  has  k
light travel times for the two arms, effective length  L , within the interferome-
ter, and  n is the refractive index of the gas present.

However including the Fitzgerald-Lorentz dynamical contraction effect as well
0 00058
as the effect of the gas present we find that  k
for  air,  which  explains  why  the  observed  fringe  shifts  were  so  small.    In  the
Einstein theory  k = 0 ; absolute motion is to be undetectable in principle. In (1)
θ is the azimuth of one arm relative to the local meridian, with ψ the azimuth of
the projected absolute motion velocity  v P . Fig.1 shows ψ from the 1925/1926
Miller [5] interferometer data for four different months of the year, from which
the RA = 5.2hr of ψ  is readily apparent. The orbital motion of the earth about
the  sun  slightly  affects  the  RA  in  each  month,  and  Miller  used  this  effect  do
determine the value of  k , but the new theory of gravity required a reanalyse of
his data [2-4].  Two interferometer experiments used helium, enabling the re-
fractive index effect to be confirmed. Fig.2 shows the coaxial cable travel times
measured by DeWitte in 1991, which also show the same RA [2-4].  That these
very different experiments show the same speed and RA of absolute motion is
one of the most startling but suppressed discoveries of the twentieth century.

So Postulates (1) and (2) are in disagreement with the experimental data. In all
some  seven  experiments  have  detected  this  absolute  motion.  Modern  interfer-
ometer experiments use vacuum with n = 1, and then from (1)  k = 0 , predicting
no  fringe  shifts.    In  analyzing  the  data  this  is  misinterpreted  to  imply  the  ab-
sence  of  absolute  motion.  As  discussed  in  [2-4]  it  is  absolute  motion  which
causes  the  dynamical  effects  of  length  contractions,  time  dilations  and  other
relativistic effects, in accord with Lorentzian interpretation of relativity.

Gravity as Inhomogeneous and Time-Dependent Spatial Flows
We now come to postulate (3) for gravity.  This postulate relates General Rela-
tivity  to  Newtonian  gravity,  and  Newtonian  gravity  is  now  known  to  be  seri-
ously flawed, and so ipso facto, by using this postulate, Einstein and Hilbert in-
advertently developed a flawed theory of gravity. Newtonian gravity was based
upon Kepler's Laws for the planetary motions within the solar system and uses
the acceleration field  g ,
G4π ρ                                                                                   (2)

also has the same external solution (5), as  C v( ) = 0  for the flow in (5). So the
presence of the  C v( )   dynamics would not have manifested in the special case
of  planets  in  orbit  about  the  massive  central  sun.  Here  α  is  a  dimensionless
constant - a new additional gravitational constant. However inside a spherical
mass  C v( ) ≠ 0   and  using  the  Greenland  ice-shelf  bore  hole  g   anomaly  data,
1 139 5, which gives the fine structure constant α =
Fig.3, we find [6] that α− =
±
1/137 to within experimental error.

Fig.3  Gravity  residuals  from  the  Greenland  bore
hole anomaly data [17]. These are the differences
in g between the measured g and that predicted by
the  Newtonian  theory.  According  to  (7)  this  dif-
ference  only  manifests  within  the  earth,  see  [6],
and  so  permits  the  value  of    α to be determined.
The  data  shows  that    α  is  the  fine  structure  con-
stant,  to  within  experimental  error.    This  small
value for α explains why the spiral galaxy rotation
speed plots are so flat, and also explains the black
holes masses at the centre of globular clusters.

shows  the  current  CODATA  value.    The  lower

for the `dark matter’ effect. Results imply that Cav-
endish laboratory experiments can measure α.

as a phenomenological treatment of the new space dynamics within the velocity
formulation  of  Newtonain  gravity  in  (3).  It  is  this  spatial  dynamics  that  has
been misinterpreted as the `dark matter' effect.  This `dark matter' dynamical ef-
fect  also  appears  to  explain  the  long-standing  problems  in  measuring  G   in
Cavendish-type experiments, as shown in Fig.4.

which is characterised by their almost flat asymptotic limit.  This rotation curve
explains the `dark matter' effect as seen in spiral galaxies, as shown in Fig.5.

Fig.5  Data  shows  the  non-Keplerian  rotation-
speed  curve  for  the  spiral  galaxy  NGC3198  in
km/s  plotted  against  radius  in  kpc/h.  Complete
curve  is  the  rotation  curve  from  the  Newtonian
theory or from General Realtivity for an exponen-
tial  disk,  which  decreases  asymptotically  like
1/
r . This descrepency is the origin of the `dark
matter’ story. The full curve shows the asymptotic
form from (12), with the decrease determined by
the  small  value  of  α.    This  asymptotic  form  is
caused by the primordial black holes at the centres
of spiral galaxies, and which play a critical role in
their  formation.  The  spiral  structure  is  casued  by
the rapid in-fall to these primoridal black holes.
Fig.6  Shows the earth with absolute linear velocity
V  in  the  direction  discovered  by  Miller  [5]  in
1925/26.  This  motion  causes  a  vorticity,  shown  by
the  vector  field  lines.  A  much  smaller  vorticity  is
generated by the rotation of the earth, known as the
Lenze-Thirring  effect.  In  General  Relativity  only
the  earth-rotation  induced  vorticity  is  permitted,
where it is known as a gravitomagnetic effect. Vor-
ticity  is  a  local  rotation  of  space  relative  to  more
distant  space.  This  rotation  can  be  detected  by  ob-
serving  the  precession  of  a  gyroscope,  whose  spin
direction S remains fixed in the local space.  VE is
the  vernal  equinox.  The  Gravity  Probe  B  satellite
experiment [14,15] is designed to detect these pre-
cessions.

where  v R  is the absolute velocity of the matter relative to the local space. See
[3,6,11] for the more general form of (7) that includes vorticity. Fig.6 shows the
vorticity  field  ∇ × v   induced  by  the  earth's  absolute  linear  motion.    Eqn.(13)
explains  the    Lense-Thirring  `frame-dragging'    effect  in  terms  of    vorticity  in
the  flow  field,  but  makes  predictions  very  different  from  General  Relativity.
These  conflicting  predictions  will  soon  be  tested  by  the  Gravity  Probe  B
[14,15] gyroscope precession satellite experiment.  However the smaller com-
ponent  of  the  frame-dragging  effect  caused  by  the  earth’s  absolute  rotation
component  of v R has  been  determined  from  the  laser-ranged  satellites
LAGEOS(NASA)  and  LAGEOS2(NASA-ASI)  [16]  and  the  data  implies  the
indicated  coefficient  on  the  RHS  of  (11)  to  ±10%.  However  that  experiment
cannot detect the larger component of the `frame-dragging' or vorticity induced
by  the  absolute  linear  motion  component  of  the  earth  as  that  effect  is  not  cu-
mulative, while the rotation induced component is cumulative.  The GP-B gy-
roscope  spin  precessions  caused  by  the  earth’s  absolute  motion  are  shown  in
Fig.7.

Fig.7  Shows  predicted  spin  precession
angle  for  the  Gravity  Probe  B  satellite
experiment over one orbit, with the orbit
shown  in  Fig.6,  caused  by  the  vorticity
arising  from  the  absolute  linear  motion
of the earth [11,12]. This particular pre-
cession  is  not  accumulative,  compared
to the precession from the earth-rotation
induced vorticity component. The GP-B
experiment  is  optimized  to  detect  this
accumulative spin precession.

Both (3) and (7) have wavelike aspects to their time-dependent solutions, with
the  time-dependence  being  the  rule  rather  than  the  exception  [2,3,7,12].  Such
wave  behaviour  has  been  detected  in  most  absolute  motion  experiments,  as
seen in the DeWitte data in Fig.2. For (3) these waves do not produce a gravi-
tational force effect via (4), but with the inclusion of the `dark matter’ spatial
dynamics in (7) such waves do produce a gravitational force effect, and there
are various experimental `anomalies` which are probably manifestations of this
effect. As well such waves affect the vorticity from (13), and in principle could
be detected by the GP-B experiment. General Relativity predicts a very differ-
ent kind of gravitational wave, but these have never been seen, despite exten-
sive searches. The new theory of gravity implies that these waves do not exist.

General  Relativity Flow-Metrics
We saw that Newtonian gravity failed because it was expressed in the limited
formalism of the gravitational acceleration field  g . As soon as we introduce the
velocity  field  formalism  together  with  its  `dark  matter'  generalisation  we  see
that numerous gravitational anomalies are explained [6]. General Relativity was
constructed  to  agree  with  Newtonian  gravity,  and  so  it  is  flawed  by  this  con-
nection.  So it is interesting to understand why General Relativity (GR)  is sup-
posed  to  have  passed  key  observational  and  experimental  tests.  GR  uses  the
Einstein tensor

This solution is the basis of various experimental checks of General Relativity
in which the spherically symmetric mass is either the sun or the earth.  The four
tests  are:  the  gravitational  redshift,  the  bending  of  light,  the  precession  of  the
perihelion of Mercury, and the time delay of radar signals. However the solu-
tion (18) is in fact completely equivalent to the in-flow interpretation of New-

which is exactly the differential form of (14) for the velocity field given by the
Newtonian form in (5).   This choice of coordinates corresponds to a particular
frame  of  reference  in  which  the  test  object  has  velocity v R relative  to  local
space.  This  result  shows  that  the  Schwarzschild  metric  in  GR  is  completely
equivalent to Newton's inverse square law: GR in this case is nothing more than
Newtonian  gravity  in  disguise.    So  the  so-called  `tests'  of  GR  were  nothing
more than a test of the `geodesic’ equation (14), where most simply this is seen
to determine the motion of an object relative to an observable and observed ab-
solute local frame of reference. These tests were  merely confirming the in-flow
formalism, and have nothing to do with a Schwarzschild spacetime ontology.

Since GR has only been directly tested using the metric in (18) or (20), it is in-
teresting to ask what is the particular form that (16) then takes.  To that end we
substitute a special class of flow-metrics, involving an arbitrary time-dependent
velocity flow-field, into (16)

This simply corresponds to the fact that GR does not permit the `dark matter'
effect, and this happens because GR was forced to agree with Newtonian grav-
ity, in the appropriate limits, and that theory also has no such effect. As well in
GR the energy-momentum tensor  Tµυis not permitted to make any reference to
absolute linear motion of the matter; only the relative motion of matter or ab-

solute rotational motion is permitted. It is very significant to note that the above
exposition of the GR formalism for the metrics in (21) is exact. Taking the trace
of  G ij  in (22) we obtain, also exactly, and in the case of zero vorticity and out-
side of matter, that

which  is  exactly  the  `velocity  field'  formulation  in  (7)  of  Newtonian  gravity
outside  of  matter.      This  should  have  been  expected  as  it  corresponds  to  the
previous  observation  that  the  `Newtonian  in-flow'  velocity  field  is  exactly
equivalent to the external-Schwarzschild metric.  There is in fact only one de-
finitive confirmation of the GR formalism apart from the misleading external-
Schwarzschild  metric  cases,  namely  the  observed  decay  of    the  binary  pulsar
orbital  motions,  for  only  in  this  case  is  the  metric  non-Schwarzschild,  and
therefore non-Newtonian.  However the new theory of gravity also leads to the
decay of orbits, and on the grounds of dimensional analysis we would expect
comparable  predictions.    It  is  also  usually  argued  that  the  Global  Positioning
System  (GPS)  demonstrated  the  efficacy  of  General  Relativity.  However  as
shown in [13] the new flow formalism of gravity also explains this system, and
indeed  gives  a  physical  insight  into  the  processes  involved.  In  particular  the
relativistic speed and red-shift effects now acquire a unified explanation.

Discussion and Conclusions
The experimental evidence from at least seven observations of absolute linear
motion, some using Michelson interferometers and some coaxial cable experi-
ments, all showed that absolute linear motion is detectable, and indeed has been
so  ever  since  the  1887  Michelson-Morley  experiment.    Even  Michelson  and
Morley  reported  a  speed  of  8km/s  using  the  Newtonian  theory  for  the  instru-
ment,  but  which  becomes  ≥ v p  =   300  km/s  when  the  Fitzgerald-Lorentz  dy-
namical contraction effect and the refractive index effect are both taken into ac-
count. It then follows that vacuum interferometer experiments will fail to detect
that absolute motion, as is the case. We also understand that the various rela-
tivistic effects are caused by the absolute motion of systems through space, an
idea that goes back to Lorentz.  Elsewhere [2,3,7] we have shown that both the
Galilean  and  Lorentz  transformations  have  a  role  in  describing  mappings  of
data between observers in relative motion, but that they apply to different forms
of the data. So absolute motion is a necessary part of the explanation of relativ-
istic effects, and indeed the Lorentz transformations and symmetry are consis-
tent with absolute motion, contrary to current beliefs. On the contrary the Ein-
stein postulates and their apparent link to these relativistic effects have always
been understood to imply that absolute motion is incompatible with these rela-
tivistic effects.  It was then always erroneously argued that the various obser-
vations  of  absolute  motion  over  more  than  100  years  must  have  been  flawed,
since the relativistic effects had been confirmed in numerous experiments.

So  the  Einstein  postulates  have  had  an  enormously  negative  influence  on  the
development of physics, and it could be argued that they have resulted essen-
tially in a 100-year period of stagnation of physics, despite many other exciting

10

and  valid  developments,  but  even  these  will  require  a  review  of  their  deeper
foundations, particularly in the case of electromagnetism.

A major effect of the Einstein postulates was the development of a relativistic
theory of gravity that was constrained to agree with Newtonian gravity in the
non-relativistic  limit.  Evidence  that  Newtonian  gravity  was  flawed  has  been
growing  for  over  50  years,  as  evidenced  by  the  numerous  so-called  `gravita-
tional anomalies', namely experimental observations of gravitational effects in-
compatible with Newtonian gravity. The most well known of these is the `dark
matter' effect, namely that spiral galaxies appear to require at least 10x the ob-
served matter content in order to explain the high rotation speeds of stars and
gas clouds in the outer regions.   We now see that this effect is not caused by
any form of matter, but rather by a non-Newtonian aspect to gravity.  As well
the  Greenland  bore  hole  g  anomaly  data  has  revealed  that  the  dimensionless
constant  that  determines  the  magnitude  of  this  spatial  dynamics  is  non  other
than the fine structure constant. The detection of  absolute motion implies that
space has some structure for it is motion through  that structure which is known
as `absolute motion', and which is causing relativistic effects.  This means that
the phenomena of gravity are described by two gravitational constant,  G  and α,
and it is the small size of α that determines the asymptotic form of the orbital
rotation speeds in spiral galaxies. As well it is α that determines the magnitude
of the black hole masses at the centres of globular clusters, and the data from
M15 and G1 confirms that  M

The detection of absolute motion and the failure of Newtonian gravity together
imply that General Relativity is not a valid theory of gravity; and that it is nec-
essary to develop a new theory.  This has now been achieved, and the essential
task  of  checking  that  theory  against  experiment  and  observation  has  now  ex-
plained all the known effects that GR was supposed to have explained, but most
significantly,  has  also  explained  the  numerous  `anomalies'  where  GR  was  in
manifest disagreement with the experimental or observational data.

The  putative  successes  of  the  Einstein  postulates  lead  to  the  Minkowski-
Einstein  spacetime  ontology  that  has  dominated  the  mindset  of  physicists  for
100 years. Spacetime was mandated by the misunderstanding that absolute mo-
tion had not been observed, and indeed that it was incompatible with the estab-
lished relativistic effects. Of course it was always possible to have chosen one
foliation of the spacetime construct as the actual one separating the geometrical
model of time from the geometrical model of space, but that never happened,
and that possibility became one of the banned concepts of physics.

We are now in the position of understanding that space is a different phenome-
non  from  time,  that  they  are  not  necessarily  fused  into  some  spacetime  amal-
gam,  and  that  the  spacetime  ontolgy  has  been  one  of  the  greatest  blunders  in
physics.  This must not be misunderstood to imply that the numerous uses of a
mathematical  spacetime,  particularly  in  Quantum  Field  Theory,  were  invalid.
What is invalid is the assertion that such a spacetime is a physical entity.

We may now ask, for the first time in essentially 100 years, about the nature of
space. It apparently has `structure' as evidenced by the fact that motion through
it is detectable by various experimental techniques, and that its self-interaction
is determined in part by the fine structure constant. As argued elsewhere [2,3,7]
one interpretation is that space is a quantum system undergoing classicalisation,
and at a deep substratum level has the characteristics of a quantum foam.  This
quantum foam is in differential motion, and the inhomogeneities and time de-
pendencies  of  this  motion  cause  accelerations  which  we  know  of  as  gravity.
This  motion  is  not  motion  of  something  through  a  geometrical  space,  but  an
ongoing restructuring of that quantum foam. One theory for this quantum foam
arises  in  an  information-theoretic  formulation  of  reality  known  as  Process
Physics, and one implication of that is that the quantum-foam system undergoes
exponential growth, once the size of the quantum-foam system dominates over
the  matter  part  of  the  universe.  This  effect  then  appears  to  explain  what  is
known as the `dark energy' effect, although of course it is not an energy at all,
just as `dark matter’ is not a form of matter.  As well within this Process Phys-
ics we see a possible explanation for quantum matter, namely as topological de-
fects embedded in the spatial quantum foam.  That works gives the first insights
into an explanation for the necessity of quantum behaviour and classicalisation.

This  quantum-foam  spatial  system  invites  comparison  with  the  much  older
concept of the ‘aether', but it differs in that the aether was usually considered to
be  some  form  of  matter  residing  within  a  geometrical  space,  which  is  not  the
case here with the quantum foam theory of space; for here the geometrical de-
scription of space is merely a coarse grained description.  Nevertheless it would
be uncharitable not to acknowledge that the quantum-foam system is a modern
version and indeed a return to the aether concept, albeit a banned concept.

Physics is a science. This means that it must be based on (i) experiments that
test its theories, and (ii) that its theories and reports of the analyses of experi-
mental outcomes must be freely reported to the physics community. Regretta-
bly, and much to its detriment, this has ceased to be the case for physics. Phys-
ics has been in an era of extreme censorship for a considerable time; Miller was
attacked for his major discovery of absolute linear motion in the 1920's, while
DeWitte was never permitted to report the data from his beautiful 1991 coaxial
cable  experiments.    Amazingly  these  experimenters  were  unknown  to  each
other,  yet  their  data  was  is  in  perfect  agreement,  for  by  different  techniques
they were detecting the same phenomenon, namely the absolute linear motion
of the earth through space. All discussions of the experimental detections of ab-
solute  motion  over  the  last  100  years  are  now  banned  from  the  mainstream
physics publications. But using modern vacuum resonant cavity interferometer
technology, and with a gas placed in the cavities, these devices could be used to
perform superb experimental detections of absolute motion. As well the Miller
and  DeWiite  data  shows  the  presence  of  a  wave  phenomenon  different  to  the
waves argued to arise within GR theory, but which have not been detected, de-
spite enormous costly efforts.  It is now time to separate the genuine relativistic
effects and their numerous manifestations from the flawed Einstein postulates,
and  to  finally  realise  that  they  are  caused  by  absolute  motion  of  systems

through a complex quantum system, which we know of as space. As for Gen-
eral Relativity it turns out to have been a major blunder. Nevertheless there is
much evidence that a new theory of gravity has emerged, and this is to be ex-
posed to critical analysis, and experimental and observational study.

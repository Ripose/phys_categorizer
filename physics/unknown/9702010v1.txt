Abstract

We consider a standard symplectic dynamics on T M generated by a natural Lagrangian L. The Lagrangian
is assumed to be invariant with respect to the action T Rg of a Lie group G lifted from the free and proper
action Rg of G on M . It is shown that under these conditions a connection on principal bundle π : M → M/G
can be constructed based on the momentum map corresponding to the action T Rg. A simple explicit formula
for the connection form is given. For the special case of the standard action of G = SO(3) on M = R3 × · · · × R3
corresponding to a rigid rotation of a N-particle system the formula obtained earlier by Guichardet and Shapere
and Wilczek is reproduced.

1. Introduction

In their remarkable papers A.Guichardet [1] and A.Shapere and F.Wilczek [2] pointed out that the phe-
nomenon of reorientation of deformable bodies (molecules represented by N point masses in [1] or cats, divers,
astronauts etc.
in [2]) in space, for a long time to be known in the case of cats to originate physically in the
angular momentum conservation, lends itself to a simple and powerful description within the framework of
the theory of connections (gauge structures). Namely they showed that in the center-of-mass system ( ~P = ~0)
the condition of vanishing of the total angular momentum (~L = ~0) can be rephrased in terms of the SO(3)-
connection in the principle bundle π : M → M/SO(3), where M is the conﬁguration space of the deformable
body (R3N minus some forbidden conﬁgurations in [1] or ”the space of located shapes” in [2]), where SO(3) acts
by rigid rotations (without deformation). In more detail the trajectories fulﬁlling ~L = ~0 represent the horizontal
curves in the sense of the connection (”vibrational curves” in [1] as opposed to purely rotational ones given by
(in general time dependent) rigid rotations).

In what follows we try to understand the origin of the connection within the standard framework [3] of

lagrangian mechanics on T M .

It is known that the central object providing the link between the symmetries and conserved quantities in
symplectic dynamics is the momentum map [4,5]. Now both ~P and ~L result (being linear in velocities) from
the symmetries of rather special type, namely those lifted to T M from M . That is why the situation under
consideration is the following : we have a lagrangian system (T M, L) with appropriate action of a Lie group G
lifted from the conﬁguration space M . Then we show how one can construct (under some restrictions on the
Lagrangian L) a connection in the principal bundle π : M → M/G. This connection happens to coincide with
the one in [1,2] in the case treated there, i.e.
for G = SO(3), M being the conﬁguration space of N-particle
system.

The organization of the paper is the following. In Sec.2 (as well as in Appendix A) the relevant facts concern-
ing the momentum map within the context mentioned above are collected. The construction of the connection
itself is described in Sec.3, the general properties of the latter are discussed in Sec.4. Several examples, including
completely elementary ones as well as the N-particle system are given in Sec.5. Some technicalities are treated
in appendices.

2. The momentum map for the lifted action T Rg

Let

be a right action of a Lie group G on a manifold M . Then the tangent map

is a right action of G on T M . Let L : T M → R be a G-invariant Lagrangian, i.e.

for all g ∈ G. The (exact) symplectic form on T M is given by ([3]; see Appendix A)

Rg : M → M

T Rg : T M → T M

L ◦ T Rg ≡ (T Rg)∗L = L

ωL = dθL = dS(dL)

det(

∂2L
∂vi∂vj ) 6= 0

where (1,1)-type tensor ﬁeld S on T M (almost tangent structure ≡ vertical endomorphism) is a lift of the
identity tensor on M (S = I ↑; in canonical local coordinates xi, vi on T M , S = dxi ⊗ ∂
∂ ˙xi if
the notation vi ≡ ˙xi is used). Since ωL is to be maximum rank 2-form, the condition

∂vi or S = dxi ⊗ ∂

(1)

(2)

must be fulﬁlled (nondegenerate Lagrangian).

Let a ∈ G (the Lie algebra of G), Xa the corresponding fundamental ﬁeld of the action Rg on M . Then

the fundamental ﬁeld of the lifted action T Rg is the complete lift ˜Xa (in coordinates if V = V i∂i on M then
˜V = V i∂i + V i,jvj ∂

∂vi on T M ). Now

L ˜Xa θL = (L ˜Xa S)(dL) + S(d ˜XaL) = θ ˜XaL

(L ˜V S = 0 for any V ). In the case of invariant Lagrangian (3) gives

i.e.

Then

or

where

˜XaL = 0

L ˜Xa θL = 0

i ˜XadθL + di ˜XaθL = 0

i ˜Xa ωL = −dPa

P = PαEα

Pα ≡ PEα : T M → R

(T Rg)∗P = Ad∗

(T Rg)∗Pα = (Ad∗

P ∈ Ω0(T M, Ad∗)

(⇒ ˜Xa is hamiltonian ﬁeld generated by Pa) where Pa : T M → R is deﬁned by

Pa :=< θL, ˜Xa >= S(dL, ˜Xa) = S( ˜Xa)L = X ↑

a L

a is a vertical lift of Xa). Since Pa depends linearly on a ∈ G, the momentum map associated with the (exact

(X ↑
symplectic) action T Rg on T M

P : T M → G∗

can be introduced by

< P (v), a >0 := Pa(v) v ∈ T M
where < ., . >0 is the evaluation map (canonical pairing) for G and its dual G∗. Fixing a basis Eα, α =
1, . . . , dimG in G and the dual one Eα in G∗ one can write

are the components of P with respect to Eα.

One veriﬁes easily the important (equivariance) property of P

or in components

where Ad∗
G-space M (i.e. V-valued k-forms on M obeying R∗
that

g : G∗ → G∗ is the coadjoint action of G on G∗. If Ωk(M, ρ) denotes the space of k-forms of type ρ on
gσ = ρ(g−1)σ, ρ being a representation of G in V ), we see

- it is G∗ - valued 0-form of type Ad∗ on T M . Thus a right action (1) of G on M which is a symmetry of a
non-degenerate Lagrangian L (in the sense of (2) ) leads automatically to the existence of (5).

3. The construction of a connection form

Let Rg be the action (1). In order to obtain a principal G-bundle

π : M → M/G

3

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

4

the action is to be in addition free (all isotropy groups trivial) and proper (the map (g, x) 7→ (x, Rgx) is proper,
i.e. inverse images of compact sets are compact). A connection form on (6) is A ∈ Ω1(M, Ad) such that

holds for all a ∈ G. Thus P ∈ Ω0(T M, Ad∗) is available whereas we need A ∈ Ω1(M, Ad). These two objects
are diﬀerent, but fortunately ”not too much” and one can quite easily obtain some A from P .

First there is a bijection between 1-forms on M and functions on T M ”linear in velocities” , viz.

< A, Xa >= a

(7)

(σ ∈ Ω0(T M ), ˜σ ∈ Ω1(M )), or in coordinates

Then if our P were linear in velocities, one could associate with it ˜P ∈ Ω1(M, Ad∗) by

σ(v) := < ˜σ, v >πM (v)

σivi ↔ σidxi

< ˜P , v >πM (v) := P (v)

(the fact that ˜P really remains to be Ad∗-type is easily veriﬁed). The demand of linearity in velocities of Pα
restricts the form of Lagrangian : according to (4)

If this is to be of the form Pαi(x)vi, the Lagrangian has to be natural, i.e.

Pα(v) = X ↑

αL = X i

α(x)

∂L(x, v)
∂vi

L(x, v) =

gij(x)vivj − U (x)

1
2

(8)

(a standard Lagrangian for potential system with time-independent holonomic constraints). Then explicitly

Pα(v) = (X ↑

αL)(v) = X i

α(x)gij (x)vj = (♭gXα)i(x)vi

and

˜Pα = (♭gXα)i(x)dxi = ♭gXα
where ♭g is the ”lowering index” operator (by means of the metric tensor g on M given by the kinetic energy
term in L) from vector to covector ﬁelds (the metric tensor g is denoted by the same letter as the group element
g ∈ G; the proper meaning of g is, however, always clear from the context). One also veriﬁes that (see (3) and
(8) )

LXa g = 0

i.e. G acts on (M, g) as a group of isometries (Xa are the Killing vectors).
The next step is a ”correction” of Ad∗-type to Ad-type (needed for A). This can be done by composition with
a map ˆh : G → G∗ induced by some Ad-invariant non-degenerate bilinear form h on G (see Appendix B). Then

i.e. ˆA is already type Ad G-valued 1-form on M .
Finally one has to check whether (7) is fulﬁlled . We have

ˆA := ˆh−1 ◦ ˜P ∈ Ω1(M, Ad)

< ˆA, Xα >= ˆh−1 < ˜P , Xα >=< ˜Pβ, Xα > ˆh−1(Eβ) =< ♭gXβ, Xα > hβγEγ =

where

= g(Xα, Xβ)hβγEγ = Cγ

α := gαβ(x)hβγ

gαβ(x) := g(Xα, Xβ)

(10)

Thus

where

According to Appendix C the G-valued 1-form

< ˆA, Xa >= C(x)(a)

C(x) : G → G, Eα 7→ Cβ

αEβ

A := C−1 ◦ ˆA = C−1 ◦ ˆh−1 ◦ ˜P

R∗

gA = Adg−1 A

< A, Xa >= a

has already all the necessary properties of a connection form, i.e.

and deﬁnes thus a connection on π : M → M/G. Explicitly we have

A = C−1 ◦ ˆh−1( ˜PαEα) = ˜PαhαβC−1(Eβ) =

= ˜Pα(hαβhβµgµν)Eν = (gαβ ˜Pβ)Eα

where gαβ(x) is the inverse to gαβ(x) deﬁned in (9). Thus it turns out to be given by a surprisingly simple
expression, viz.

A = AαEα = (gαβ ˜Pβ)Eα = gαβ(♭gXβ)Eα

(11)

Note : notice that the bilinear form hαβ was present on the scene only temporarily and it dropped out from
the resulting formula (and thus one does not need it in fact for the construction of A).

4. Some properties of the connection given by A

Let γ : R → M be a curve on M representing some motion of the system under consideration. What does
it mean in physical terms if it is purely horizontal (i.e. represents a parallel translation in the sense of A) ?
According to (11) we have

< A, ˙γ >= 0 ⇒ < ˜Pα, ˙γ >= 0

Pα(ˆγ(t)) = 0

where ˆγ is the natural lift of γ to T M ( (xi(t), ˙xi(t)) in coordinates). Thus a horizontal curve is such motion of
the system that all conserved quantities Pα have all the time zero value (remember ~P = ~0, ~L = ~0 in the Sec.1.).

Now let W ∈ HorxM be any horizontal vector. Then

0 =< A, W >= gαβ < ˜Pβ, W > Eα = gαβg(Xβ, W )Eα

or

or

for all α. But Xα just span the vertical subspace so that

g(Xα, W ) = 0

V erxM ⊥ HorxM

Thus the horizontal subspace is simply the orthogonal complement of the vertical one with respect to the
scalar product in TxM given by the kinetic energy metric tensor. Note that this serves as the deﬁnition of the
connection (it gives it uniquely) in [1] (in the special case of G = SO(3) etc. discussed in more detail further in
Sec.5c.). In the approach presented here it came as its property.

5. Examples

5.1. A point mass on a board

We illustrate the construction of the connection form A on three examples, the ﬁrst two being completely

elementary and the last one being that discussed in [1] and [2].

Let us have a (one dimensional) board of mass m1 laying on the surface of the water and denote x the
distance of its left end from some reference point on the surface. Let ξ denote the distance of a point mass m2
from the left end of the board. The Lagrangian of the system reads

L(x, ξ, ˙x, ˙ξ) =

m1 ˙x2 +

m2( ˙x + ˙ξ)

2

− U (ξ)

1

2

(interaction of the point mass m2 with the board depends only on their relative position). The translational
invariance of the system means that there is the action of G ≡ R on the conﬁguration space M [x, ξ] given by

(the ”unlocated shape” is given by the position of m2 with respect to the board, i.e. by ξ) such that L is
invariant with respect to its lift

A = A1E1 = g11(♭gX1)E1 =

((m1 + m2)dx + m2dξ) =

Rb : (x, ξ) 7→ (x + b, ξ) b ∈ R ≡ G

T Rb : (x, ξ, ˙x, ˙ξ) 7→ (x + b, ξ, ˙x, ˙ξ)

or

(one can take E1 = 1 since G = R). The curve γ ↔ (x(t), ξ(t)) is horizontal if < A, ˙γ >≡< A, ˙x∂x + ˙ξ∂ξ >= 0 ,
i.e. if

which is just vanishing of the total (linear) momentum of the system.

5.2. A point mass on a gramophone disc

Let us have a gramophone disc (its moment of inertia with respect of the axis being I) and a point mass m
on it. If the angle α measures the orientation of the disc with respect to the outer space and r, ϕ are the polar
coordinates of the point mass m with respect to the disc, the Lagrangian of the system is

L(r, ϕ, α, ˙r, ˙ϕ, ˙α) =

I ˙α2 +

m( ˙r2 + r2( ˙α + ˙ϕ)2) − U (r, ϕ)

(interaction of the point mass m with the disc depends only on their relative position). The rotational invariance
of the system means that there is the action of G ≡ SO(2) on the conﬁguration space M [r, ϕ, α] given by

which is just vanishing of the total angular momentum of the system.
If σ(t) ↔ (r(t), ϕ(t)) is a curve in the space of unlocated shapes M/G, the resulting curve in M is γ(t) = σh(t) =
the horizontal lift of σ(t), given by (r(t), ϕ(t), α(t)), where

In particular, the holonomy (the angle corresponding to the element of SO(2) ) for the closed path (loop)
σ(0) = σ(1) is

If for example the point goes round the disc once counterclockwise at constant distance r0 (r(t) = r0, ϕ(t) = 2πt),
the net rotation of the disc is

5.3. N-particle system

Let ~ra , a = 1, . . . N denote the radius vector of a-th particle , xi

a its i-th component (i = 1,2,3), ma its mass.
There is a natural action of the Euclidean group G = E(3) on the conﬁguration space of the N-particle system,
consisting in rigid rotations and translations

~ra 7→ ~raB + ~b B ∈ SO(3)

We will treat the rotations and the translations separately. The standard summation convention is adopted in
what follows, i.e. the sum is implicit for pairs of equal indices, otherwise the symbol of sum is written explicitly.
The translational subgroup acts by

Thus horizontal motion is such that the total (linear) momentum ~P as well as the total angular momentum ~L
of the system vanish.

6. Conclusions and summary

In this paper we show that (under some restrictions mentioned in Sec.3.) given a natural lagrangian system
(T M, L) with symmetry G lifted from the conﬁguration space M a connection in principle bundle π : M → M/G
can be constructed. The connection form A is given by remarkably simple explicit formula (11). It generalizes
”angular momentum equals zero” [6] connection from [1],[2], corresponding to the group G = SO(3). The
construction of A makes use of the momentum map of the associated exact symplectic action of G on T M ,
making the link between the connection and conserved quantities explicit. A calculation shows that the vertical
and horizontal subspaces are mutually orthogonal, which was used as the deﬁnition in [1].

Appendix A : Some useful facts concerning the T M geometry

Here we collect some more details on the constructions and objects on T M , used in the main text (see [3]).
If w ∈ TxM , its vertical lift to v ∈ T M (πM (v) = x) is the tangent vector in t = 0 to the curve t 7→ v + tw.
The vector ﬁeld (on T M ) obtained in such a way from the vector ﬁeld V on M is denoted by V ↑. In canonical
coordinates (xi, vi) on T M

V ≡ V i(x)∂i 7→ V ↑ ≡ V i(x)

∂
∂vi

Let V be a vector ﬁeld on M , and let us denote its local ﬂow Φt. Then the generator of the local ﬂow T Φt on
T M is by deﬁnition the complete lift ˜V of V . In coordinates

V ≡ V i(x)∂i 7→ ˜V ≡ V i(x)

∂

∂xi + V i,j(x)vj ∂

∂vi

If w ∈ TvT M , then the map

Sv : TvT M → TvT M w 7→ (π∗w)↑

(the lift being to v) is linear, giving rise to the (1,1)-tensor in TvT M . This pointwise construction deﬁnes a
(1,1)-tensor ﬁeld S on T M (almost tangent structure ≡ vertical endomorphism), in coordinates S = dxi ⊗ ∂
∂vi .
Its properties used in the main text are (easily veriﬁed in coordinates)

If B is (1,1)-tensor ﬁeld on M , then its lift to T M is deﬁned by B↑(w) := (B(π∗w))↑. Then S = I ↑ (I being
the unit tensor ﬁeld on M ).

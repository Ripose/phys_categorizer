Fully  non-inductive  discharges  are  performed  on  the  Tore  Supra  tokamak  using  Lower 
Hybrid  (LH)  waves  in  a  current  drive scheme. The MHD aspect is a crucial issue for these 
discharges,  since  after  hitting  an  MHD  limit  it  may  run  into  a  regime  where  a  strong 
permanent  MHD  activity  develops.  This  so-called  MHD  regime  [Maget04]  degrades  fast 
electron  confinement  as  well  as  LHCD  efficiency  and  electron  confinement  in  the  plasma 
core. In the 2003 campaign, a milestone has been reached with the injection of more than 1 GJ 
of energy in the tokamak, in stationary discharges lasting more than 6 minutes. But the MHD 
regime has been encountered in several discharges, while the record discharges have shown a 
very  stationary  (m=3,  n=2)  MHD  activity  in  the  plasma  core  without  triggering  the  MHD 
regime (see figure 1). 

With the exploration of several global parameters such as the toroidal magnetic field (B), 
the parallel refractive index of LH waves (n//) and the total plasma current (Ip), a map of MHD 
properties  for  fully  non-inductive  discharges  has  been  drawn.  This  is  achieved  by 
extrapolating in Ip reference magnetic equilibriums from stationary pulses, while imposing a 
constant shape of pressure and current profiles, and a poloidal beta b p~1/Ip. Note that in the 
experimental conditions explored, the LH deposition profile is globally peaked, but hollow in 
the very core, and the region of reversed magnetic shear extends while n// increases.  

Linear  stability  properties  are  investigated  with  the  CASTOR  code  [Kerner89],  which 
gives  the  linear  growth  rate  of  resistive  MHD  modes  in  toroidal  geometry.  They  show  the 
existence of stable domains for qmin>2 and for 1.5>qmin>1, in agreement with the analysis of 
past experiments [Wijnands94, Litaudon96, Zabiego01]. But most of the explored domain is 
MHD  unstable,  including  the  point  where  the  record  pulses  have  been  performed  with  a 
remarkable reliability (see figure 2). Saturated tearing modes are indeed observed in several 
cases without triggering the deleterious MHD regime.  

Considering  the  non-linear  evolution  of  MHD  modes  is  necessary  for  discrimination 
between  harmless  saturated  modes  and  the  MHD  regime.  A  particular  pulse  where  a  slow 
ramp down of the total plasma current was performed up to the triggering of the MHD regime 
allows to identify the mechanism of transition. It can be attributed to the full reconnection of 
the  double  tearing  mode,  which  flattens  the  electron  temperature  profile  up  to  the  outer 
resonant  surface.  Its  condition  of  occurrence  can  be  estimated  from  the  calculation  of  the 
.  The  full 
helical  flux  relative  to  the  resonant  surface  q=m/n: 
reconnection happens when y * is close to zero at the outer resonant surface [Carreras79]. The 
domain  where  the  MHD  regime  can  be  triggered  is  therefore  approximately  given  by  the 
y
.  Such  an  evaluation  is  consistent  with  the  experimental 
condition  m/n>qmin>q(
points  where  the  MHD  regime  is  indeed  triggered  (see  figure  3),  although  a  safe  interval 
exists for qmin slightly below a rational (as for record pulses), while full reconnection occurs 
for 
 slightly above zero, in agreement with non-linear MHD simulations. Note that the 
regime where full reconnection is observed is tearing-like, scaling with resistivity as h 3/5, and 
is consistent with the 'intermediate regime' described by Ishii et al [Ishii00].

As  a  result,  a  map  of  MHD  properties  for  fully  non-inductive  discharges  is  established, 
which can be used for the design of future experiments. For longer-term purpose, the drawing 
of such a map could be implemented in a real-time module for self-programmed discharges, 
which could avoid deleterious MHD activity while optimizing the discharge performance.

Amplification ?

We propose an experimental implementation of matter wave amplification by optical pumping (MAO)
with metastable calcium atoms. First experimental results indicate that pumping rates can be significantly higher
than in previous experimental schemes and let it appear promising that the threshold condition for generation of
degeneracy can be reached.

The  effect  of  stimulated  emission  of  photons  in  a  laser  is  based  on  their  bosonic
nature. Consequently, an analogous phenomenon should occur for other bosonic particles as
for  example  atoms  with  integer  total  angular  momentum.  In  fact,  in  the  late  nineties,
following  the  first  experimental  observation  of  Bose-Einstein  condensation  (BEC)  [1],
schemes for matter wave amplification have begun to attract interest and theoretical models
for matter wave analogs of the laser have been proposed, which employ the mechanism of
optical  pumping  as  a  key  element  [2,3].  Matter  wave  amplification  by  optical  pumping
(MAO) might open a novel path for a continous production of coherent matter waves at rates
exceeding those accessible via BEC by orders of magnitude.

A fundamental prerequisite for MAO are atoms which provide a so called L

-level
scheme comprised of two stable, energetically well separated ground states, |g1> and |g2>,
and one excited state |e>, that allows for controlled optical pumping of atomic population
from |g2> to  |g1> as sketched in fig.1(a). By means of laser cooling techniques a dense cold
sample of atoms is continuously produced in the reservoir state |g2> which plays the role of
the inverted medium in a laser. Atoms in |g1> are captured inside a potential well resulting
for example from a far-detuned optical dipole trap. These atoms play the role of the photons
stored in some cavity mode in a laser. Optical pumping, i.e. excitation to |e> and subsequent
spontaneous emission can transfer atoms from |g2> into  |g1>. Due to the bosonic character of
the atoms the probability to end up in the motional state | g1,n > scales with the number Nn  of
atoms already populating | g1,n >. This is analogous to the effect of stimulated emission in a
laser.  If  the  optical  pumping  rate  for  some  motional  state  |  g1,n >  exceed  the  losses,  a
macroscopic population of this state should arise. The motional ground state | g1, 0> typically
experiences the highest pumping and the lowest loss rate and should thus exhibit the lowest
threshold for degeneracy.

Unfortunately,  in  traps  with  an  extension  much  larger  than  the  wavelength  of  the
optical pumping photons with respect to all three dimensions it is argued that the threshold
condition for the onset of degeneracy cannot be reached due to the possible reabsorption of
the  optical  pumping  photons  which  heat  the  trapped  atomic  sample  [4].  Traps,  which  are
microscopic  in  three  dimensions  reach  threshold  at  such  high  densities  that  three-body
collisions may yield formation of molecules, and large pumping rates are difficult to achieve
due to the small trap volume. One way out of this dilemma may be to surpass the threshold in
a microscopic trap and subsequently to perform an adiabatic increase of the trap volume [5].
A simpler way around the reabsorption problem is to employ strongly asymmetric traps from

1

which the optical pumping photons can escape with a high probability [3]. We can roughly
estimate  under  which  conditions  threshold  should  be  reached  despite  of  reabsorption,  for
example, in the case of a cylindrical trap of radius r and length l. The probability for an atom
in |e> within the trap volume V= p  r2  l (with motional degrees of freedom described by a
thermal state with temperature T and thermal de Broglie wavelength l
th) to be transfered to
the motional ground state of |g1> in an optical pumping process, is approximately given by a
Franck-Condon factor which can be estimated to be Pgain = l
3/V [6]. This has to be compared
with the reabsorption probability which is approximated by Ploss  =  s
2/2p
denotes the resonant absorption cross section for the optical pumping photons of wavelength
p. Thus, P gain ‡
 Ploss  is equivalent to 2 * (l
 1 which can be satisfied
for the realistic combination of parameters (l
th /r)  = 5*10-2 and (l/r) = 1000.
With this trap geometry in mind we neglect the reabsorption problem in order to roughly
estimate the condition for the onset of degeneracy, finding that the pump rate per trap volume
V into state |e> should exceed R0  »
 is the ground state loss rate [6]. At 1
microkelvin l
th is typically on the order of 50 nm and loss rates can be as low as 10-2  s–1
yielding R0/V = 8*1013 cm–3s–1. For the cylindric trap considered above this corresponds to R0
= 2,5*107 atoms/s into the trap volume. To realize such high transfer rates of atoms at such
low temperatures presents a serious challenge for the experimentalist.

In  this  article  we  discuss  an  experimental  implementation  of  atomic  matter  wave
amplification  by  optical  pumping  based  on  ultracold  metastable  calcium  atoms.  Calcium
owing to its two valence electrons provides a singlet and a triplet ground state, well separated
energetically, which possess sufficiently long life times in order to serve as the states |g1>
and  |g2> respectively (see fig.1(b)). The extremely long life time of the 3P2 triplet state (the
reservoir  state  |g2>)  results  because  the  transition  to  the  singlet  ground  state  violates  two
selection  rules  concerning  spin  and  total  angular  momentum.  An  infrared  laser  of
approximately 2 m m wavelength can optically pump atoms from  3P2 via 3D2 to 3P1, which has
a sufficiently short life time of approximately 0,4 ms and thus may serve as the excited state
|e> in fig.1(b). The transition at 657 nm connecting 3P1 to the singlet ground state  1S0 (which
serves as the trapped state |g1>) is the famous red intercombination line. The singlet ground
state has zero total angular momentum and possesses no further degeneracy. It is basically
insensitive  against  magnetic  fields  but  can  be  trapped  in  a  far-detuned  dipole  trap.  As  a
notable advantage over similar schemes employing noble gases (e.g. argon [7]) which also
provide two stable electronic states, in our scheme the |g1> atoms are real ground state atoms
such  that  no  heating  collisions  (e.g.  hyperfine  structure  changing  collisions,  Penning
ionization etc.) can arise.
The experimental task is to produce cold calcium atoms at 1 m K in the 3P2 triplet state
at a rate in the 1010 s–1 range. Figure 2 indicates how this goal can be achieved in two steps by
laser  cooling.  Calcium  possesses  an  extremely  efficient  Doppler-cooling  line  at  422  nm
(natural linewidth  G/2p
  = 34,6 MHz) connecting the singlet ground state 1S0 to the singlet 1P1
state.  This  can  be  exploited  to  load  a  magneto-optic  trap  (MOT)  from  a  Zeeman-cooled
atomic beam. Capture rates above 1011 atoms/s should present no principle difficulty. As is
indicated in fig.2(a), the  1S0  ﬁ
 1P1 transition is not a perfectly closed transition, a feature
shared by all earth alkaline atoms with the exception of magnesium. The excited 1P1 singlet
level may decay into the lower lying 1D2 state with a rate of  approximately g
1 = 2180 sec-1.
About 78 % of these atoms return to the ground state in approximately 3 ms either directly in
a quadrupol transition or via the  3P1 state. These atoms are not captured during this time and
thus the capture volume of the MOT has to be sufficiently large (> 1 cm) to recycle them
when they return to the ground state. The remaining 22 % are transfered to the metastable 3P2
state and cannot be recaptured at all. This is the dominant trap loss mechanism. For the case

2

l
of perfect recycling the production rate of  3P2 atoms equals the capture rate of the MOT and
thus can exceed 1011 atoms/s.

The  3P2 atoms are produced at a temperature given by the Doppler cooling limit for
the 422 nm cooling line of 0,8 mK. This is sufficiently low to capture them in a second MOT
employing the closed 3P2 ﬁ
 3D3 transition at 1978 nm. The narrow linewidth of this transition
of about 57 kHz together with its long wavelength provides a very low Doppler-limit of only
1,3 m K  and  a  recoil  limit  of  122  nK.  Moreover,  the  J=2ﬁ
J=3  level  structure  allows  for
polarization  gradient  cooling,  such  that  temperatures  around  a  microkelvin  should  be
obtained. For implementation of the MAO scheme we can not tolerate the presence of 422 nm
photons which would excite atoms to 1P1 (cf. fig.1(b)). Thus, a cold beam has to be extracted
from the 1978 nm MOT into a second vacuum chamber (with background pressure below 10–
11  mBar)  and  recaptured  in  a  second  MOT  at  1978  nm  (cf.  fig.  2(b)).  This  has  been
established as a standard procedure in laser cooling experiments with alkalis and should not
yield any difficulties like loss of atoms. Note that the 1978 nm MOT is compatible with the
synchronous operation of a dipole trap for the singlet ground state.

While for alkalis magneto-optic trapping has become a standard technique that has
been established in many laboratories, yet only a few research groups have operated such
traps  for  earth  alkaline  elements.  Traps  for  strontium  [8,9,10],  calcium  [8,11,12]  and
magnesium [13]  have  been  reported  with  numbers  of  trapped  atoms  in  the  107  range.  In
contrast to experiments with alkalis which are readily addressed by semiconductor lasers and
which can be captured from room temperature vapors, experiments with earth alkaline atoms
have involved highly complex atomic beam machines and laser systems. We have built a
compact and efficient experimental setup consisting of a miniature vacuum apparatus and all
solid  state  light  sources.  Our  experiment  is  sketched  in  fig.  2(b).  Calcium  atoms  are
evaporated at 600(cid:176) C through 45 adjacent channels of 10 mm length and 1 mm diameter. The
atoms are decelerated by a laser beam counterpropagating the atoms inside a 30 cm long
tapered solenoid. A spatially varying magnetic field compensates the Doppler shift of the
decelerated  atoms.  After  the  slowing  magnet  an  additional  coil  operated  with  reversed
direction of current serves to produce a relative minimum of the magnetic field in order to
decouple the atoms from the slowing process at a defined velocity. During this decoupling
process  the  atoms  are  cooled  by  a  two-dimensional  optical  molasses  along  the  transverse
directions. Subsequently, the cold atoms enter a small vacuum chamber, where three retro-
reflected laser beams (Ø = 10 mm) are superposed with a quadrupole magnetic field in order
to  form  a  magneto-optic  trap.  The  trapping  region  is  located  at  50  cm  distance  from  the
apertures of the source and 12 cm down stream from the transverse optical molasses.

The necessary 422 nm photons are made with an all solid state laser system starting
off  with  a  5  W  commercial  frequency-doubled  YAG  system  pumping  a  miniaturized
Ti:Sapphire laser which produces 800 mW dual frequency output at 845 nm [14]. The two
frequencies separated by about 1 GHz are used for sum frequency mixing in a KNbO3 crystal.
yielding  a  total  blue  output  of  150  mW  consisting  of  3  frequency  components.  The  sum
frequency component  (approximately 100 mW) is used for the experiment. About 70 mW is
directed the Zeeman slower and the transverse molasses while 30 mW are used for the MOT
beams,  which  has  been  found  to  yield  optimized  results.  The  available  422  nm  power  is
limited  by  thermal  lenses  typical  for  KNbO3  already  at  modest  fundamental  powers.
Increasing the available fundamental power to 2 W and using LBO for sum frequency mixing
should  lead  to  a  factor  five  increase  of  422  nm  output.  In  order  to  generate  narrow  band
radiation at 1978 nm we have developed a miniaturized, Tm:YAG laser based on the same
design criteria as used for our Ti:Sapphire laser. We obtain up to 90 mW of tunable dual
frequency radiation [15], far more than needed for our infrared MOT.

For  interpretation  of  our  experimental  findings  we  employ  a  rate  equation  model
including the levels 1S0, 1P1, 1D2 , 3P1, indicated in this order by 1,2,3,4 in fig. 2(a). Neglecting
collisional loss due to hot background atoms the rate equations are:

N1   =   R  – W N1 + (G
N2   =   W N1 – (G
 + g 23  + W) N2
N3   =   g 23 N2 – (g 34 + g 31 + g ) N3
N4   =   g 34 N3 – g 41 N4

 g 31 N3 + h

 g 41 N4

Here Ni is the number of trapped atoms in state i, h
 is the fraction of those atoms which after
having decayed back to the ground state can be recaptured while R and W denote the 422 nm
MOT-capture  rate  and  the  excitation  rate  for  the  1S0 ﬁ
  1P1  transition.  The  steady  state
g   of  3P2 atoms to be  R  =  e  R, where R
solution of eq.1 yields the production rate R = N3
denotes the 422 nm MOT capture rate and  e  =  g  [(1 - h ) ( g
34 + g
31)+ g ]–1  varies between 0,22
and 1 depending on whether there is no (h =0) or perfect (h =1)  recycling.  If  G

 and thus a value for e  by measuring the dominant component g
– in the decay of N 2. This
quantity is directly accessible in our experiment via observation of the 422 nm fluorescence
of the decaying MOT after shutting off the atomic beam cooling. The observed decay within
about  15  ms  (cf.  fig.3)  lets  us  estimate  the  recycling  efficiency  h
  to  be  91  %,  the
corresponding value of e  is 0,76. Here we have assumed s = 0,5 which corresponds to the
laser power and trapping beam diameters in our MOT. The rate R can be directly connected
to the number N(1P1) of atoms in the 1P1 -state by R = N(1P1) * g

480 s –1. The value of N(1P1) is given by P/hw
, where P is the total 422 nm fluorescence
power and hw
 is the energy per 422 nm photon. In our preliminary experiments we find that
N(1P1) = 2,2*107 and correspondingly R = 1,1*1010 s –1. Assuming again s = 0,5 we have 1,4
*108 calcium atoms in the  1S0 ground state. This represents the highest number of trapped
calcium atoms reported so far, although important components of our experiment are not yet
optimized. The diameters of our trapped atomic samples are typically 5 mm corresponding to
a  density  of  about  2,1*109  atoms/cm3.  The  sizes  of  the  trapped  samples  decrease  with
decreasing loading rate, showing that our MOT operates in the density limited regime [16].

Similarly as in ref.[12], we have used 672 nm light in order to repump 3 1D2 -atoms
via 5  1P1 back to the singlet ground state 4 1S0 and thus close the dominant loss channel of
our MOT. First experiments show only a factor 3 to 4 increase of 422 nm fluorescence in

presence  of  672  nm  light,  in  contrast    to  the  expectations  of  a  factor  of  about  100  if  the
residual trap loss would result from collisions with hot background atoms. This may be partly
due  to  incomplete  repumping  because  of  inhomogeneous  magnetic  broadening  and  the
existence of non-coupling states for the repumping transition. Moreover, one may speculate
that, similarly as shown for strontium in [10], collisions between cold 4 1S0 and 4 1P1 atoms
may yield an additional loss channel owing to the effect of radiative redistribution [17] which
can be particularly efficient due to the existence of a metastable  1P
g molecular state for the
calcium dimer.

Our experimental observations make it appear promising to surpass the threshold for
quantum degeneracy in future experiments as is seen from the following estimation. Under
the realistic assumption that we can in fact cool all mestastable atoms down to 1 m K into a
volume of Vcool = 1 mm3, we may estimate the number of atoms pumped per second into our
example cylinder trap  (radius r = 1 m m, length l = 1 mm, volume V=  p r2l ) to be R0 = g  R
V/Vcool where g  = 2,6*103 s–1 is the natural decay rate of the 3P1 triplet state. This yields R0  =
9 *107  s –1  which  is  to  be  compared  with  the  theoretical  threshold  rate  R0  =  2,5*107  s –1.
Collisions between cold metastable atoms, particularly in the presence of infrared photons,
might complicate the situation providing a challenge of future theoretical work to investigate
these.

In summary, we have proposed a novel experimental implementation for matter wave
amplification  by  optical  pumping  employing  laser  cooled  metastable  calcium  atoms.  A
bichromatic magneto-optic trap is under construction that operates in two successive cooling
steps. Preliminary experiments show more than 108 trapped ground state calcium atoms and a
production rate of more than 1010 metastable calcium atoms per second. These results make it
look promising that the threshold condition for the generation of quantum degeneracy can be
approached.

the  narrow  band  infrared  transition  at  1978  nm  should  yield  temperatures  around  1
microkelvin. Atoms being transfered to 1D2 are no longer trapped. About 78% of these atoms

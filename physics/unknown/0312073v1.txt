Dusty  plasmas  are  perhaps  the  fastest  growing  area  in  plasma  physics  with  a  surprisingly  wide  range  of 
applications. They represent the most general  form of space, laboratory and industrial plasmas. 
We  shall  mainly  discuss  space  dusty  plasmas  although  many  of  the  conclusions  are  valid  for  the  laboratory 
plasmas as well. We use the term “dusty plasma” when the number of grains in Debye sphere is greater than one, 
and “dust in plasma” when the number of grains in Debye sphere is less than one. 
The main objective of the paper is to determine asymptotic solutions to the initial-value conditions for Vlasov-
Ampère/Gauss system of equations that is to find the “far field” solutions, [1, 2]. Next, we determine dispersion 
relations  for  longitudinal  waves  (DAW  and  DIAW)  by  use  of  the  linearized  Vlasov  equations.  In  case  of 
simplified equilibrium velocity distributions but for fully nonlinear plasmas, we determine velocity distributions 
),( ςα uf
 and by use of Sagdeev potential equations, we compute the solitary and double 
layer structures for a set of dusty plasma parameters. By use of Sagdeev potential, we determine the electrical 
capacity of plasma double layers. 
It has been proved [3], that Vlasov description of dusty plasmas is valid not only in the usual weakly coupled 
plasma  regime  but  also  in  the  strong-coupling  limit  for  dusty  plasmas.  Deviations  from  both  limits  are  to  be 
expected for the intermediate range of coupling when Coulomb crystallization occurs.

1.  Introduction  

Mathematical description of Dusty Plasmas is a very complex problem esp. of nonlinear 
processes. The main object is the charge to mass ratio. The ratio is a complicated function of 
plasma state and parameters, e.g. nonlinear waves, double layers, sheath, planetary rings, 
radial spokes, number densities of plasma components and other structures. There is no 
consequent and consistent description of Dusty Plasmas. Usually, we accept a model based on 
fixed charge/mass ratio or accept a probability distribution of the ratio and dust grains as an 
additional plasma parameter of dust component. It can be correct if the time scale of wave 
phenomena is much shorter than the time scale of charge/mass ratio changes.  
In many instances the surface potential of a grain is approximately equal to Φs=2.5 kT/e. 
However, the magnitude of the charge is not necessary equal to 4πα|Φs|, where α is the grain 
radius. If the shape of a grain is irregular or the dust density becomes larger, the charge is 
smaller than this value. When secondary electrons are important, the surface potential can 
have three equilibrium values, and grains of different signs of charge can exist in plasmas. 
This may have important consequences for the rate at which grains collide and coagulate to 
form bigger particles. Such coagulation must have occurred during the early stages of the 
solar system evolution from its solar nebula stage.  
In addition, the grain charge fluctuates randomly in a plasma and systematically as a grain 
gyrates about the magnetic field or moves through gradients of plasma density and/or 
temperature. These fluctuations can cause the angular momentum of a grain in a planetary 
magnetosphere to change and can lead to radial transport. It is evident that many more cases 
are relevant and need to be studied in detail.

artificial equilibrium distributions.

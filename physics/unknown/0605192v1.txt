Abstract. Using the many-year observations at several high-latitude observatories in the Northern 
and Southern Hemispheres, the regularities in distribution of magnetic impulse events (MIEs) 
amplitudes are studied. It is shown that the “tails” of the functions of statistical distributions of 
impulse amplitudes are approximated by a power function of the form f (A) = A-a, where A is the 
impulse amplitude, and a is the power index laying in the range from 1 to 5. Experimental 
confirmation is obtained to the hypothesis suggested earlier that the impulse generation regime 
qualitatively corresponds to the model of on-off intermittency. It is assumed that the model of the 
on-off intermittency may be considered as one of the possible mechanisms of MIEs generation. 
According to this model, the statistical distribution of the amplitude of rare spikes is described by a 
power function with the power index varying from 1 to 8. An assumption is made that the value of 
the power index a may serve as a characteristic of the level of wave turbulence of the plasma in the 
magnetosphere in analogy to the fact that in the on-off intermittency model, the power index is a 
parameter of the medium in which extremely large spikes are formed. It is found that the majority 
of the analyzed statistical distributions of MIEs amplitudes have the index a exceeding 2, the fact 
being typical for chaotic regimes called “the strong turbulence”. In some cases the index a is close 
to the unity, this fact being typical for the regimes generated in weakly turbulized medium. The 
results obtained make it possible to assume that: а) at higher magnetospheric latitudes (77±), the 
plasma turbulence degree is higher that at lower latitudes (63±); b) in the afternoon sector of the 
magnetosphere, the plasma is stronger turbulized than in the prenoon sector; c) in the Northern and 
Southern Hemispheres the magnetospheric plasma is stronger turbulized in summer and winter, 
respectively; d) at the growth phase of solar activity the magnetospheric plasma is stronger 
turbulized than at the declining phase. The dependence of the power index a on the solar wind 
speed, longitude f of the IMF vector, and orientation of the Bz component demonstrates the 
influence of interplanetary conditions on the high-latitude magnetosphere plasma where MIEs are 
formed and also the changes of the degree of magnetospheric turbulence under actions of external 
factors.

1. Introduction 

the 

the  recent  decades 

  During 
interest 
increased  to  studies  of  high-latitude  magnetic 
impulse  events  (MIEs),  their  mean  duration 
varying  from  6  to  12  min  and  intensity  being 
several tens of nT [Lanzerotti et al., 1991]. It is 
confirmed  by  numerous  publications  [Kataoka 
et  al.,  2003;  Korotova  et  al.,  1999;  Moretto  et 
al.,  2004;  Shields  et  al.,  2003;  Sibeck  and 
Korotova, 1996]. The above mentioned specific 
magnetic  disturbances  are

mainly  [Glassmeier  et  al.,  1989;  Lanzerotti  et 
al.,  1991;  Moretto  et  al.,  2004].  Magnetic 
impulses  are  registered  from  sub-auroral  and 
auroral  latitudes  (62o  -67o)  [Glassmeier  et  al., 
1989]  to  the  regions  of  the  cusp  and  polar  cap 
(75o  80o)  [Sibeck  and  Korotova,  1996].  The 
maximum of the impulse occurrence falls to the 
latitudinal range 70o-76o [Sibeck and Korotova, 
1996].  The  probability  of  impulse  observations 
depends  on  geomagnetic  latitude  and  decreases 
considerably  at  the  transition  from  higher  to 
lower  geomagnetic  latitudes.  In  magnetograms 
the  impulses  are  often  detected  by  a  sudden 
pulse changes in all components of the magnetic

field  [Lanzerotti  et  al.,  1991;  Sibeck  and 
Korotova, 1996]. 
  The morphology of MIEs (spatial-temporary, 
spectral,  and  polarization  characteristics)  has 
been studied in detail in publications [Lanzerotti 
et  al.,  1991;  Lin  et  al.,  1995;  Moretto  et  al., 
2004;  Sibeck  and  Korotova,  1996].  In  some 
publications  the  relation  between  the  impulses 
and solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field 
(IMF) parameters has been analyzed [Bering III 
E.A. et al., 1990; Kataoka et al., 2003; Konik et 
al.,  1994;  Moretto  et  al.,  2004;  Sibeck  and 
Korotova,  1996].  Much  enough  attention  has 
been paid in the publications to the study of the 
relation  of  MIEs  to  other  types  of  magnetic 
disturbances 
and  geophysical  phenomena 
[Arnoldy  et  al.,  1996;  Konik  et  al.,  1995; 
Korotova  et  al.,  1999;  Mende  et  al.,  1990; 
Shields et al., 2003; Yahnin et al., 1995]. 
  On  the  basis  of  the  statistical  results  of 
magnetic 
impulse  studies,  several  different 
mechanisms  causing  formation  of  such  short-
time  magnetic  disturbances  are  considered. 
the  following  mechanisms  are 
Most  often 
in  publications:  1)  reconnection 
mentioned 
processes  (flux 
transfer  events  -FTE),  2) 
variations  in  the  solar  wind  dynamic  pressure, 
and  3)  Kelvin-Helmholtz  instability.  According 
to  Konik  et  al. 
the  magnetic 
reconnection at the dayside of the magnetopause 
may  lead  to  a  formation  a  minimum  of  50%-
70%  to  a  maximum  of  90%  of  MIEs,  whereas 
the  fluctuations  of  the  solar  wind  dynamic 
pressure  are  responsible  for  their  generation 
only  between  15%  and  30%  of  events.  The 
maximum 60% of MIEs is related to the Kelvin-
Helmholtz  instability.  Kataoka  et  al.  [2003] 
think  that  FTE  and  jumps  in  the  solar  wind 
pressure  may  explain  ~  30  and  20%  of  cases, 
respectively,  whereas  50%  of  MIEs  may  be 
related  to  the  mechanism  of  hot  flow  anomaly 
(HFA).  Thus,  currently  there  is  no  complete 
clearness  in  the  problem  on  mechanism  of 
magnetic  impulse  excitation.  Moreover,  each 
mechanism  discussed  in  publications  is  able  to 
explain  generation  of  only  some  number  of 
impulses.  According  to  satellite  data,  the  high-
latitude  magnetopause  region  is  characterized 
by  turbulent  regions  [Savin  et  al.,  2001]  what 
may be responsible for impulse generation. This 
fact  assumes  the  presence  of  other  mechanisms 
explaining generation of MIEs.

much higher and reaches 8 (“strong turbulence” 
regime). 
  Evidently, 
similarity  of 
geomagnetic impulses and the regime with rare 
and  large  spikes  is  not  a  sufficient  sign  to 
identify  MIEs  with  the  on-off  intermittency 
model.  Moreover,  a  necessary  factor  is  a 
similarity  of  the  behavior  of  corresponding 
impulse characteristics to the known regularities 
of 
the  spikes  amplitude  distribution  and 
intervals  between  them  typical  for  the  on-off 
intermittency model. It should be noted, first of 
all, that the impulse generation is determined by 
quite  particular 
the 
magnetosphere  itself  and  in  the  interplanetary 
environment.  However, 
unpredictable 
for 
destruction  of 
example, to occurrence of external disturbances 
is  possible.  Then  it  is  impossible  to  determine 
correctly  the  duration  of  the  intervals  between 
impulses.  In  other  words,  after  an  external 
impact,  the  trajectory  of  the  system  in  real 
geophysical conditions leaves its attractor. Then 
the interval after which the next impulse appears 
would  be  determined  not  only  by  the  time  of 
returning to the attractor, but by the time of the 
system  preparation  to  a  generation  of  the  next 
impulse.  Due  to  that,  the  distribution  of  the 
duration  of  intervals  between  impulses  will  be, 
evidently,  distorted.  Therefore,  the  use  of  the 
statistics  of  distribution  of  intervals  between 
impulses 
identification  of  an  on-off 
intermittency at generation of MIEs is incorrect. 
On the other hand  (as  numerous  morphological 
studies have shown), the conditions occurring in 
the  magnetosphere  at  impulse  generation  are 
almost  identical,  and  that  makes  it  possible  to 
consider the observed impulses as belonging to 
the same general aggregate. Because of that, the 
distribution of impulse amplitudes may be used

The  maximum  value  A(t)  of  each  impulse  was

  4.  Some  threshold  value  of  the  impulse 
amplitude (A0) was chosen, and beginning from 
this value an approximation of the experimental 
data  by  a  theoretical  curve  was  performed. 
Since  there  is  no  formal  approach  making  it 

to 

possible to determine the threshold value A0, we 
took as the A0 approximation the point in which

Further, 
the  P=P(A  >  A0)  values  were 
normalized  to  the  maximum  value  Pmax    of  the 
P(A > A0) function. To obtain the approximating 
curve  and  confidence  intervals,  we  used  the 
Levenberg  -  Marquardt  robust  method  [Dennis 
and  Schnabel,  1988;  Huber,  1984]  realized  in 
the MathLab packet. At the concluding stage of 
the  study,  the  “tails”  (P=P(A  >  A0))  of  the 
accumulated  histograms  of  magnetic  pulse 
amplitudes  were  approximated  by  the  power 
functions,  and  the  value  of  the  power  index a 
was determined. Below, discussing distributions 
of magnetic impulse magnitudes, we will mean 
only the distribution “tails”, that is, analyze only 
impulses with amplitudes A > A0. 
  5.  We  considered  the  power  index a  as  the 
main  characteristic  of  the  MIEs  amplitude 
distributions.  To  estimate  the  reliability  degree 
of  the  obtained  power  indices,  we  used  the 
following statistical characteristics: the standard 
deviation  and  correlation  coefficient  between 
the theoretical curve and experimental data. The 
upper  and  lower  boundaries  of  the  confidence 
intervals  of  “tails”  of  the  distributions  at  the 
95% level were also determined.

3. Results 
 
  1.  Following  the  procedure  described  above 
we  studied  the  amplitude  distribution  for  the 
entire  sampling  of  magnetic  impulses  detected 
at each of four observatories. Figure 1 shows the 
magnetic 
amplitude  distributions 
observed  at  MIR,  HIS,  MOL,  and  NVL.  In  the 
impulse 
dominating  number  of  cases, 
amplitude  corresponded  to  the  10-70  nT  range. 
At higher latitudes (MIR, HIS), the amplitude of 
some  impulses  exceeded  150-200  nT,  whereas 
at  low  latitudes  (MOL)  it  was  below  100-150 
nT. 
  The  magnetic  impulses  observed  at  NVL 
should be specially noted. The MIEs amplitude 
level  at  NVL  is  much  lower  (10-60  nT)  that  at 
other  observatories.  One  can  see  that  the

distributions and estimates of the a dependence 
on various factors. In particular, the dependence 
of a on local time, season, solar activity phase, 
and  interplanetary  conditions  was  studied.  It 
should  be  noted  here  that  since  further  all  the 
analyzed  impulses  at  each  observatory  were 
split  into  groups,  the  volume  of  the  sampling 
decreased.  The  latter  fact  led  to  the  increase  in 
the standard deviation, decrease  in  the  value  of 
the correlation coefficient, and spreading of the 
confidential  intervals.  However,  the  evaluation 
of  the  errors  in  the  index  a  for  each  impulse 
sampling  taken  separately  showed  that  the 
errors lie within acceptable limits. For example, 
the  standard  deviation  varies  within  0.1-0.5, 
correlation  coefficient  was  0.79-0.99,  and  at  a 
confidential  probability  of  95%  the  boundaries 
of  the  confidence  intervals  were  spread  not 
more than up to 0.30 of the a value. 
  The  analysis  of  the  dependence  of  the 
impulse  amplitude  distribution  on  local  time 
is 
that  at  all  observatories

follows  from  the  analysis  of  our  data  that  the 
level of the impulse amplitudes observed in the 
prenoon  sector  is  by  a  factor  of  about  1.5-2 
higher  than  the  level  of  impulse  amplitudes 
registered  after  1200  MLT.  This  conclusion  is 
true for MIR, HIS, and MOL observatories. No 
such  tendency  is  found  at  NVL:  the  average 
values  of  amplitudes 
the  prenoon  and 
afternoon time are nearly the same.

magnetic  impulses  at  MIR  and  HIS  were  used. 
The  data  were  split  into  four  groups  according 
in  geophysics 
to 
separation  of  all  months  of  a  year  to  seasons 
(around  the  winter  and  summer  solstices  and 
around the  spring and  fall equinoxes). Figure 4 
shows the dependence of a on the season in the 
Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

For the sake of comparison, the data of MIR and

Southern  Hemisphere  (MIR)  the  value  of  a 
reaches  its  highest  values  in  the  winter  season 
(a = 5.01), whereas in the Northern Hemisphere 
(HIS) a takes relatively high values in summer 
(a = 3.40). In the equinoxes the a value at both

summer  seasons.  It  is  worth  noting  that  the 
tendency  of  a  variations 
the  both 
hemispheres is identical. This experimental fact 
manifests  the  influence  of  the  season  on  the 
MIEs  amplitude  behavior  in  both  hemispheres 
of the magnetosphere. 
  4.  Using 
two 
observatories (MIR and MOL), the distributions 
of  the  impulse  amplitudes  were  analyzed  and 
the  dependence  of  the  value  of  the  index a  on 
solar activity phase was estimated. All the cases 
of  MIEs  observations  at  MIR  and  MOL  were 
split  into  two  groups.  The  first  group  included 
the impulses observed at the decay phase of the 
21st  cycle  of  solar  activity  (1981-1985).  The 
second  group  contained  the  impulses  observed 
at the rise phase of the 22nd cycle (1986-1989). 
The analysis showed that at MIR, the value of a 
at the decay phase was 2.3 and increased up to 
3.2  at  the  rise  phase.  Similar  tendency  of  a 
growth from 2.0 to 2.8 depending on the phase 
of solar activity cycle was observed at MOL. 
  5. Now we come do description of the results 
of studies of the impulse amplitude distribution 
in  various  geophysical  conditions.  First,  we 
describe  briefly  the  interplanetary  condition 
characteristics  on  against  a  background  of 
which MIEs were observed. The distributions of 
hourly  values  of  the  solar  wind  velocity  V, 
plasma concentration n, modulus of the B field, 
dynamical  pressure  of  the  solar  wind rV2,  IMF 
components  Bx,  By,  and  Bz,  and  latitude  q  and 
longitude  f  of  the  IMF  vector  in  the  solar-
ecliptical  coordinate  system  were  analyzed  for 
the  cases  of  MIEs  observations  at  MIR,  MOL, 
and  HIS.  Since  there  is  not  enough  data  in  the 
the  cases  of  MIEs 
King’s  Catalog 
observations  at  NVL, 
the  corresponding 
analysis  of  the  solar  wind  and  IMF  parameters 
was not performed. 
 
Table 3. Values of the a Index at Various Geomagnetic Latitudes at Various Parameters of the  
Interplanetary Medium 

  The  analysis  of  the  interplanetary  medium 
state  (according  to  the  hourly  data  on  the 
parameters  of  the  solar  wind  plasma  and  IMF 
from the King’s Catalog) during observations of 
the magnetic impulses showed that MIEs occur 
both  at  quiet  (V  <  400  km  s-1,  30%  of  events) 
and  disturbed  (V  >  400  km  s-1,  70%  of  events) 
solar wind. In the dominating number of cases, 
MIEs were registered at relatively low values of 
the  solar  wind  density  (n  º  4-6  cm-3)  and  IMF 
modulus  (B  º  4-6  nT).  During  observations  of 
impulses,  the  value  of  the  solar  wind  dynamic 
pressure (rV2) was mainly (1-3)ÿ10-8 dyne/ cm2. 
In the majority of cases, MIEs were observed at 
Bx>0,  By<0,  and  Bz>0.  The  longitude  f  was 
mainly  distributed  within  the  intervals  120o-
180o  and  300o-360o,  this  fact  manifesting  a 
radial  orientation  of  IMF  during 
impulse 
observations.  In  60  %  of  cases  MIEs  were 
observed  at  the  sunward  direction  of  the  IMF 
vector  and  in  40  %  of  cases  MIEs  were 
observed  at  the  anti-sunward  direction  in  the 
ecliptic  plane.  Magnetic 
impulses  occurred 
mainly at the IMF orientation angle q which lies 
within  the  interval  from  -30o  to  30o.  Thus  the 
interplanetary  medium  conditions  under  which 
magnetic  impulses  were  registered  at  MIR, 
MOL, and HIS are identical to the conditions of 
MIEs  observations  obtained  according  to  the 
data  of  other  observatories  [Bering  III  et  al., 
1990; Kataoka et al., 2003; Konik et al., 1994]. 
  Taking 
interplanetary 
conditions  under  which  MIEs  were  observed, 
we  analyzed 
impulse 
amplitudes as functions of the solar wind speed, 
angle f, and direction of the vertical component 
of IMF and obtained the following values of the 
power  index.  Table  3  show  the  values  of  the a 
index  for  two  observatories  of  the  Southern 
Hemisphere 
(MIR  and  MOL)  and  one 
observatory (HIS) of the Northern Hemisphere.

One can see in Table 3 that the value of a varies 
considerably  depending  on  the  interplanetary 
medium  parameters.  In  the  speed  range,  all  the 
MIEs  events  were  split 
two  groups: 
impulses observed at V < 400 km s-1 and at V > 
400  km  s-1.  In  the  Southern  Hemisphere  the 
values of the a index at V < 400 km s-1 is higher 
than at V > 400 km s-1. The opposite situation is 
observed in the Northern Hemisphere. 
  We  estimated  the  value  of  the  a  index  for 
MIEs  corresponding  to  the  negative  (the  anti-
sunward direction of the IMF vector, f º 120±-
180±) and positive (sunward direction, f º 300±-
360±)  IMF  sectors.  Here  also  an  asymmetric 
behavior  of  a  in  two  hemispheres  of  the 
magnetosphere is detected. For example, at MIR 
and  MOL, a  is  higher  at  the  sunward  direction 
of  the  IMF  vector  than  at  the  anti-sunward 
direction,  whereas  the  opposite  tendency  is

at the southward orientation of IMF, whereas at

4. Discussion 
 
 
It  is  known  that  geomagnetic  impulses  have 
properties characteristic for Alfven disturbances 
equations 
[Lanzerotti,  1989].  The  main 
describing  Alfven  waves 
in  plasma  were 
presented  by  Mio  et  al.  [1976]  and  Mjolhus 
[1976].  One  can  understand  qualitatively 
generation  in  plasma  of  structures  (impulses), 
considering  the  behavior  of  Alfven  waves 
propagating along constant external field. In this 
case,

may  serve  as  an  acceptable  model.  This 
equation  has  a  solution  of  a  soliton  type.  If  the 
soliton  is  unstable,  one  can  hardly  expect 
appearance  of  structures  in  turbulent  regimes 
[Zakharov  et  al.,  1988].  In  the  case  of  soliton

(
,  the  calculations  performed 
R u
by  Zakharov  et  al.,  [1988]  showed 
that 
development of a modulation instability leads to 
a  formation  of  a  soliton  grating.  As  a  result  of 
the  interaction  of  the  solitons  with  each  other, 
the  grating  period  increases  and      pumping  of 
the  energy  of  more  weak  solitons  into  more 
intense  ones  occurs.  Finally,  this  leads  to  a 
formation  of  single  impulses.  Later  studies 
showed 
three-

principal features of equation (1) is based on the 
principles of realization of on--off intermittency 
[Malinetsky  and  Potapov,  2000].  The  main 
conclusion  of  this  work  is  that  the  density  of 
probability  of  impulse  amplitudes  (in  the  same 
way as in Iwasaki and Toh [1992]) has a power 
form.  The  analysis  of  the  dependence  of  the 
power index on parameters shows that possible 
values of a lie within 1§ a § 8. 
  The  study  of  distributions  of  magnetic 
impulse  amplitudes  observed  at  different 
geomagnetic latitudes showed that the “tails” of 
the obtained distributions are approximated by a 
power  function  with  the  power  index  varying 
(depending  on  various  factors)  from  1  to  5.0. 
Thus,  one  can  conclude  that  the  behavior  of 
magnetic  impulses  qualitatively  corresponds  to 
the on—off intermittency model. Depending on 
local  time,  season,  solar  activity  cycle  phase, 
geomagnetic  latitude  of  the  observation,  and 
solar  wind  and  IMF  parameters,  the  power 
index may be close to the unity (see Table 1 and 
Table 2), this value being typical for regimes in 
weakly-turbulized  medium.  The  majority  of

regimes 
[Malinetsky and Potapov, 2000]. 
  All  the  above  said  makes  it  possible  to 
assume that the value of a may be considered as 
a  characteristic  of  the  turbulence  level  in  the 
magnetospheric  plasma  in  the  same  way  as  in 
the  on—off  intermittency,  the  power  index  is  a 
parameter  of  the  medium  where  exclusively 
large  spikes  are  formed.  Apparently,  the  value 
of  the  a  index  manifests  the  state  of  the 
magnetospheric plasma depending on local time 
(Table  2),  season  (Figure  4),  geomagnetic 
latitude  (Figure  3),  solar  activity  cycle  phase, 
interplanetary 
of 
and 
medium(Table 3). For example, lower values of 
a in the prenoon sector of the magnetosphere as 
compared  to  the  afternoon  sector,  evidently 
manifest  different  turbulence  degree  of  the 
plasma  at  the  prenoon  and  afternoon  flanks  of 
the magnetosphere. Using our evaluations of a, 
one can conclude that plasma is more turbulized 
in the afternoon sector of the magnetosphere. 
  The  results  presented  in  Figure  3  may  be 
interpreted as changes in the plasma turbulence 
level  in  the  magnetosphere  depending  on  the 
geomagnetic  latitude.  Since  the  value  of  the a 
index increases at an increase of the latitude of 
observation,  one  can  assume  that  at  higher 
latitudes  the  plasma  is  stronger  turbulized.  The 
asymmetric  behavior  of  the  a  index  obtained 
from  the  data  of  impulse  observations  (for 
example,  at  MIR  and  HIS)  manifests  an 
asymmetry  in  the  degree  of  plasma  turbulence 
in 
the 
magnetosphere depending on the season (Figure 
4).  For  example,  the  magnetospheric  plasma  is 
more turbulized in the summer season and in the 
season of the winter solstice in the Northern and 
Southern Hemispheres, respectively. 
  On  the  basis  of  the  a  value  estimates  at 
different  phases  of  the  solar  activity  cycle,  one 
can  assume  that  the  turbulence  degree  of  the 
magnetospheric  plasma  is  higher  at  the  rise 
phase of solar activity than at the decay phase. 
  The  data  presented  in  Table  3,  show  that 
depending  on  various  parameters  of  the  solar 
wind and IMF, the a index varies and so varies 
the  state  of  the  plasma  in  the  magnetosphere. 
For  example,  in  the  Northern  Hemisphere  the

magnetospheric plasma is more turbulized at the 
solar  wind  speed  >  400  km  s-1  and  at  the  IMF

Southern  Hemisphere  vise  versa  the  plasma  is 
stronger  turbulized  at  V  <  400  km  s-1  and  the 
IMF  vector  directed  sunward.  The  direction  of 
the  IMF  vertical  component  also  impacts  the a 
value in a different way in the two hemispheres 
of  the  magnetosphere.  According  to  the  a 
estimates,  the  plasma  is  stronger  turbolized  at 
the  southward  and  northward  directions  of  the 
Bz  component  of  IMF  in  the  Northern  and 
Southern  Hemispheres,  respectively.  In  our 
opinion, the a dependence on the interplanetary 
conditions may be caused by the fact that, under 
the  action  of  external  factors,  the  medium  in 
are  generated 
impulses 
which  magnetic 
changes: actually the plasma of the high-latitude 
magnetosphere undergoes alterations. Naturally, 
this influences the character of MIEs amplitudes

level 
the  Earth 
turbulence  degree  of

5. Conclusion 
 
  Using  the  data  of  observations  at  a  series  of 
high-latitude  observatories,  we  studied 
the 
character  of  distribution  of  magnetic  impulse 
amplitudes  observed  in  the  conditions  of  quiet 
and moderately disturbed magnetosphere. 
 
It  is  shown  that  at  each  observatory  the 
“tails” of  the statistical distributions  of  impulse 
amplitudes are described by a power function of 
the  form  f  (A)  =  A-a  and  qualitatively  coincide 
with  chaotic  regimes  peaks  intermitted  by 
seldom  spikes.  An  assumption  is  made  that  the 
intermittency  may  be 
model  of  on—off 
considered  as  one  of 
the  mechanisms  of 
magnetic  impulse  excitation.  It  is  shown  that, 
depending  on  local  time,  season,  solar  activity 
cycle 
of 
geomagnetic 
observation,  parameters  of  the  solar  wind  and 
IMF,  the  statistical  distribution  of  the  MIEs 
amplitudes  follows  the  regularities  typical  for 
the  regimes  generated  in  the  weakly  turbulized 
medium  (a  ~  1),  or  for  the  chaotic  regimes 
known  as  “strong  turbulence”  (a  >  2).  It  is 
assumed that the value of the a index may serve 
as  a  characteristic  of  the  level  of  plasma  wave 
turbulence in the high-latitude magnetosphere.

stronger  turbulized  in  summer,  whereas  in  the 
Southern Hemisphere it is stronger turbulized in 
winter;  d)  the  plasma  is  stronger  turbulized  at 
the rise phase of solar activity cycle, than at the 
decay phase. The dependence of the a index on 
the  solar  wind  speed,  longitude  f  of  IMF,  and 
the  Bz  component  orientation  manifests  about 
the influence of the interplanetary conditions on 
the  plasma  of  the  high-latitude  magnetosphere, 
where  MIEs  are  formed,  and  also  about  the 
changes  in  the  degree  of  turbulence  under  the 
action of external factors.

Abstract.  In this article we report on the design, fabrication and tests of micro-fabricated 

broadband filters suitable for proper electromagnetic thermalization of electrical lines connected to 

sensitive quantum electronics experiments performed at dilution fridge temperatures. Compared to 

previous such miniature filters, the new design improves on performance and reliability. These 

filters can be packed in space-saving cases with either single or multi-contact connectors. Measured 

performance in the accessible range compares well to simulations. We use these simulations to 

discuss the effectiveness of these filters for electromagnetic thermalization at 30 mK.

INTRODUCTION. A number of quantum electrical experiments need to be operated at millikelvin 

temperatures for optimum performance. One can think for instance of solid-state qubits or of tunnel 

spectroscopy experiments (in which energy resolution is directly proportional to the temperature). If 

cooling a sample down to the mK range is rather easy, ensuring that an experiment is performed at 

full thermal equilibrium is not. The reason is well known :  leads connecting the sample to room 

temperature apparatus feed in electromagnetic noise which may directly couple with the device 

under test  (e.g. in the case of a qubit) and/or heat up the electrons of a small device above the 

temperature of the crystalline network. Indeed, many experimental results in the field of low 

temperature quantum electronics can only be interpreted with an electronic temperature greater than 

that of the refrigerator. The noise generated by room temperature instruments is at the minimum the 

Johnson thermal noise (the electrical equivalent of Planck's black body radiation) extending in 

frequency up to 300 K.kB/h ~ 6 THz, in the infrared frequency range. One thus needs to insert in the 

leads connected to the sample filters able to absorb this very wide band noise and to reemit a 

thermal spectrum at the experiment temperature which corresponds to a bandwidth of a fraction of 

1 Ghz. This problem has been investigated theoretically, and the stringent requirements this 

imposes on noise attenuation have been evaluated for operating Coulomb blockade devices [1,2]. 

Unfortunately, there exists no ready-made commercial filters with such wide stop-band and 

sufficient attenuation. This is why in the last 25 years many custom filter designs have been 

proposed in order to effectively thermalize experiments at mK temperatures. Most solutions rely on 

the use of shielded lines (usually coaxial lines) and shielded distributed RC filters. These filters 

being dissipative, they must themselves be placed at the lowest temperature so that their own 

thermal noise is at equilibrium. A popular solution (easy to make and use) is to combine both the 

line and the filter by using a lossy coax such as Thermocoax® [3,4]. One drawback with this

approach is that the length required for a low enough cut-off frequency is often of the order of 

meters, which is impractical to install in many dilution fridges where space is often scarce. 

Moreover, when such a line is running between two or more different temperatures, estimating the 

resulting output noise temperature is not easy. Other popular filters are powder filters based on skin 

effect in metallic grains [5]. These are very effective filters, but once again they tend to be rather 

large and their performance is not reliably predictable at design time. 

Some ten years ago, in the need for space-saving filters for Coulomb blockade experiments, one of 

us was involved in the design and fabrication of miniature filters, as reported in Ref. [2]. These 

filters were based on microfabricated chips  made by optical lithography which consisted of a 

resistive meander line sandwiched between two insulating layers and ground planes, implementing 

a distributed RC filter. These filters had a predictable performance in the 0-20 GHz range which 

could be tailored at design time. They had several weaknesses, though : (i) their very high 

frequency attenuation was intrinsically limited by residual coupling between adjacent meander lines 

and (ii) it was further degraded by shortcomings in the casing design. Finally, (iii) these filters had 

reliability issues upon thermal cycling attributed to differential contraction of the various materials 

involved in the filter assembly. Critically reviewing these problems, we came up with a new design 

of microfabricated filters which corrects all these problems. We now consistently obtain much 

better stop-band attenuation together with other desirable characteristics : less DC resistance, less 

total capacitance, better ageing and high-voltage capability. In this article we describe this design, 

along with the fabrication, packing and performance of the corresponding filters.   

DESIGN. When designing a filter such as we need one can imagine that very high frequency 

electromagnetic waves (hereafter microwaves for short, but extending in fact up to infrared) will

sneak into the least metallic hole, slot or crack and propagate through vacuum (or dielectric) much 

like a fluid would : If there is a dielectric path between input and output, microwaves will find their 

way. Thus, designing an efficient filter is much like making the device leak-tight to fluids. The key 

step towards electromagnetic “hermeticity” in our new design is the use of a brass substrate for the 

microfabricated filter chip in place of the more standard silicon substrate used in the old design. 

This way, not only we suppress the dielectric substrate which is difficult to seal perfectly and which 

behaves as a wave guide, but we also suppress differential thermal contraction of the filter chip with 

respect to the brass case which ensures that no cracks will appear upon thermal cycling. The design 

of the filter chip itself is shown in Fig. 1. It consists of a resistive meander line connecting the input 

pad to the output pad. The meander line alternates narrow parts and large pads. This provides a 

steeper cut-off than a meander with uniform width having the same total resistance and capacitance, 

due to reflections on impedance discontinuities. The meander line is completely surrounded by an 

insulating material and a  ground sheath, which provides decoupling of adjacent arms of the 

meander at high frequency. Apart from the different sections, it is like a miniature distributed 

resistive coaxial cable. Its behavior is thus somewhat similar to that of Thermocoax-type filters, but 

its waveguide modes are rejected at  higher frequencies due to the smaller cross-sections of the 

dielectric. 

FABRICATION. Fabrication starts from 0.4 mm-thick brass sheet out of which we cut 75 mm 

diameter wafers. Each wafer is mechanically polished down to a 1/4 µm  grain size to yield a fair 

optical polish. Then we deposit the bottom insulating layer using spin coating. This layer consists of 

Cyclotene 4024 bisbenzocyclobutene-based (BCB) negative photoresist from Dow Chemicals. For 

our requirements we chose a spin speed of 6000 rpm, thus obtaining a resist thickness of 2.5 µm. By 

varying the dilution of the photoresist or/and the spin speed we can tune this thickness reliably 

4/16

down to 500 nm, and change the filter capacitance accordingly. The resist is then patterned using 

UV photolithography.  The wafer is subsequently immersion-developed and submitted to a 

moderate cure at 210 °C under inert atmosphere, to convert about 75% of the resist into the final 

polymer. This hardens the layer, which can then handle further microfabrication steps, and enhances 

subsequent layers adhesion. In this step, the BCB looses ~10 % thickness. Then, following the 

manufacturer recommendation, the wafer is submitted to an SF6/O2 Reactive Ion Etching plasma to 

eliminated resist residues and enhance subsequent layer adhesion on BCB. This plasma etching 

further reduces the resist thickness by about 100 nm. Next, we spin on a 1.3 µm thick layer of 

Shipley S1813 positive photoresist. The meander pattern is then exposed, aligned onto the previous 

insulating layer. Prior to develop, the wafer is immersed 30 s at 30°C in dichlorobenzene to obtain 

after development an over-hanging resist profile needed for a good lift-off. The substrate is then 

placed in a Joule evaporator and we deposit a 5 nm-thick titanium adhesion layer followed by a  100 

- 400 nm thick copper-gold alloy at 50% atomic content with a resistivity of ~1.3×10-7 Ωm, to form 

the resistive meander. The thickness of the layer is chosen to obtain the desired total resistance of 

the meander and filter characteristics. As copper and gold evaporate at different rates, we prepare a 

fresh load at each pump down and evaporate it completely to obtain a reproducible alloy. After 

deposition the resist is lift-off in acetone. In a third lithographic step, we pattern a second BCB 

layer to cover the meander in the central part of the chip while leaving uncovered the substrate 

between arms of the meander and the connecting pads of the meander (see figure 1). The BCB is 

finally hard cured for 1 hour at 250 °C  under inert atmosphere to achieve 98% polymer conversion 

and bring it to nominal electrical and mechanical characteristics.  In the last lithographic step, 

another layer of Shipley S1813 is used to evaporate a ~1 µm-thick gold sheath on top of the 

meander to terminate encapsulation and electrical shielding of the meander in the central part. 

Finally, the brass wafer is diced into 3x8 mm chips for individual filters. For multi-line filters,

several adjacent filters are left attached together.

ASSEMBLY. Filter chips are then mounted in cases. In Fig. 2 we show the design of a case for a 

single filter equipped with soft-soldered SMC connectors. The goal is to mount the filter chip in-

between two perfectly separated chambers. The two chambers are separated by a small metallic 

barrier running across the meander. Perfect electromagnetic separation of the chambers is reached 

by filling all machining gaps with silver epoxy. In each chamber we establish a connection from the 

connector pin to the filter pad using thin wire and silver epoxy. Finally, we close the cover applying 

here also silver epoxy to make it electromagnetically leak-tight. Following the same design, other 

cases with different connectors can be made. In particular, double filters for shielded twisted pair 

lines are assembled in cases fitted with miniature triaxial connectors (Fischer series 101), and up to 

25 filters can be packed in a 34.5 x 30.1 x 13 mm case equipped with two 25 contacts shielded 

micro-subD connectors.

TESTING. Fig. 3 shows the measured attenuation of a single filter equipped with SMC coaxial 

connectors. These measurements were performed using a 65 GHz two 50 Ω ports vector network 

analyser (Anritsu 37297D). The S21 forward transmission data show that the filter has a steep cut-off 

reaching an attenuation greater than the ~ -100 dB noise floor of the analyser at 4.5 GHz, and 

remains below the noise floor up to 65 GHz. Attenuation measurements carried out at 4.2 K (data 

not shown) show little change in the response of the filter, essentially due to a ~20% reduction of 

the resistivity of the alloy we use. However, due to losses in the cables running form the network 

analyser into the liquid helium dewar, the sensitivity of this low temperature measurement is much 

lower than that of the room temperature measurements shown in Fig. 3, and thus it is less suited to 

test for proper attenuation performance. Repeated thermal cycling of the filter showed no

measurable change in properties. Since one application for these filters in our laboratory will be to 

filter high voltage lines connected to piezo elements in a low temperature scanning probe 

microscope, we further submit all assembled filters to a 30s 400V test between the meander line and 

ground. A significant fraction of the filters do not pass this test, developing a permanent short to 

ground. According to the specifications, the BCB break down field is greater than 300 V/µm. Given 

the BCB thicknesses used,  400V should not exceed the breakdown voltage of the dielectric. We 

think the lower breakdown voltage observed in many filters is due to the field enhancement 

occurring on sharp defects. The overall yield after assembly and high voltage test is of the order of 

50%, which could likely be improved by a better control of process parameters and cleanliness. 

Note that given their rather low resistance, these filters are acceptable on lines driving ~10 nF piezo 

elements used for inertial stick-slip motion, where a large instantaneous current is needed.

SIMULATIONS. We now compare the measurements shown in Fig. 3 to the expected behaviour 

of this filter. For this we have  modelled the full filter chip using a 2.5-D planar electromagnetic 

simulator (Sonnet). Given the feature sizes and aspect ratios used, approximations made in such a 

simulation are  valid throughout the whole frequency range we consider [6]. The data input in the 

geometrical model were the nominal dimensions of the meander line and the measured thickness of 

both BCB layers (1.6 µm for the bottom  layer and  2.2 µm for the top layer) obtained using a thin 

film profile meter. The sheathing of the meander is modelled using vias between metallic layers 

above and below the dielectric layers. Electrical data for the BCB are taken from the manufacturer : 

εr = 2.5, the relative dielectric constant and a loss tangent of 2x10-3. These inputs yield a 81 pF 

capacitance to ground of the filter at low frequency, in remarkable agreement with the 80 pF 

measured value.  The conductivity of the meander is adjusted to reproduce the 77 Ω  dc resistance 

of the filter. Given these inputs, the calculated forward transmission also shown in Fig. 3 is in very

good agreement with the measurements. The small discrepancy showing up above 2 GHz might be 

due to the fact that we do not take into account the circuit outside the filter chip. For instance, the 

small wires connecting the chip to the connectors introduce some inductance in series with the filter 

which increases attenuation as frequency rises. The connectors also introduce losses in the 

transmission above 10 GHz. These simulations also show the superiority of the present design 

compared to the former one [2]: if we remove  isolation between adjacent arms of the meander, the 

filter transmission remains between -85 dB and -95 dB in the 5 to 100 GHz range (see inset of Fig. 

3).

Given the good agreement obtained, one can wish to push this simulation up to higher frequencies 

to get insight on the behaviour of the filter in ranges where it would be extremely difficult to 

measure. However, it turns out that the full chip simulation remains at the simulator noise floor 

(between -150 and -170 dB, depending on the frequency [7]) above 12 GHz, and furthermore 

becomes too large to be performed on an average workstation for frequencies larger than 

~100 GHz. In order to go beyond these limitations one needs to recourse to subdividing the filter 

into smaller parts and to cascading the resulting S matrices. Note that this assumes that the 

subdivided parts are independent otherwise than through their connecting ports (i.e. no coupling 

through the sheathing, which is what one expects from a bulk metallic shield). Doing so, we can 

push the simulation up to 6 THz without excessive complications (See inset of Fig. 3). We find that 

above 50 GHz oscillating features appears with a 95 GHz period, corresponding to standing waves 

in the 1 mm-long features of the meanders, and a second one at ~ 400 GHz corresponding to a 

standing wave in the width of a large pad in the meander. To sketch the filter behaviour, we can say 

that after the initial cut-off, the transmission curve forms a quasi-plateau between roughly 20 and 

400 GHz with a maximum transmission of ~ -220 dB and subsequently falls rapidly again with an

overall  exp − f  dependency, due to skin effect losses [8]. Note that these simulations do not 

take into account a number of effects which might be important at very high frequency such as the 

increase of the loss tangent of the dielectric or the surface roughness of the conductors, which likely 

would further increase filter attenuation.

DISCUSSION. Based on these simulations, we can evaluate the effectiveness of these filters for 

experiment thermalization. To do so, we calculate the effective temperature seen by a device 

connected to a line comprising a 50 Ω source at 300 K and either a single filter anchored at 30 mK 

or two filters respectively placed at 4.2 K and 30 mK. This frequency-dependent effective 

temperature is the temperature at which an impedance equal to the output impedance of the line 

should be to have the same noise level than that reaching the device connected to the line at 30 mK 

at a given frequency. The equivalent noise source at the output of the line can be evaluated exactly 

by adding properly the contributions coming from the various parts of the line situated at different 

temperatures weighted with the corresponding attenuation provided by the setup [9]. The result is 

displayed in Fig. 4 and shows that effective 30 mK thermalization is reached in the 1-30 GHz range 

when using two filters in series [10]. At higher frequencies, the photon flux at the output of the line 

is larger than that of a 30 mK impedance but remains in absolute so low that it's probability to spoil 

an actual experiment is negligible. On the lower end of the spectrum, the effective temperature is 

also above equilibrium but corresponds to photons present in the thermal spectrum at 30 mK. 

Further reduction of noise in this part of the spectrum may be desired, in particular to protect the 

experiment against electromagnetic interferences (EMI) in the laboratory ambient. In this frequency 

range, this can be done using carefully assembled discrete elements. In this goal, the connecting pad 

of the filter chip were made to accommodate 0805-size surface mounted components such as 

readily available lossy inductors sold for EMI filtering with good attenuation in the 0.1-1 GHz

range. 

At low temperature, Joule effect in such a resistive filter can easily heat the electrons of the filter 

out of equilibrium, due to the poor electron-phonon coupling [11]. Therefore, care should be taken 

no to drive excessive currents through these filters. For a given allowed relative increase η of the 

electronic temperature, we can evaluate at lowest order the maximum dc current allowed to flow in 

the filter as 

imax=5  V T ph

5 −1/ R where σ ~ 1  nW/µm3/K5 is the coupling constant, V is the 

volume of the resistive material volume where electron-phonon coupling takes place, Tph is the 

phonon  temperature and R the resistance of the filter. To fix ideas, if one takes the whole volume of 

resistive material of the filter measured above, V = 1.5 106 µm3 and a 5% increase in the electron 

temperature (η = 1.05) above Tph = 30 mK, one gets a maximum allowed dc current imax  = 0.34 µA.

POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. As mentioned above, the resistivity of the copper-gold alloy we 

use depends on temperature. This alloy was chosen mainly for its ease of use in our Joule 

evaporator as it yields a relatively low-stress film. This alloy could be replaced by another type of 

resistive alloy less dependent on temperature, provided maybe another deposition technique was 

used. Possible choices could then be Ni-Cr, Cu-Ni or Cu-Mn.

65 GHz. Above ~ 4.5 GHz the noise floor of the analyser is reached (the peak at 9 GHz is also noise 

and is due to a calibration artefact). We also plot the results of a microwave simulation with no

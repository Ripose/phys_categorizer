ABSTRACT

In  the  framework  of  special  relativity,  all  particles  are  point-like  or  string-like.  This  nature  of
particles  has  caused  the  divergence  difficulties  in  quantum  field,  string  and  superstring  theories.  In  the
framework  of  special  relativity,  due  to  the  non-uniformity  of  the  m -space  and  phase  space  in  the  usual
inertial  coordinate  system,  Boltzmann’s  hypothesis  of  the  equality  of  the  probability  of  equal  volume
element  is  no  longer  appropriate.  That  makes  it  very  difficult  to  construct  Lorentz-invariant  statistical
mechanics  and  thermodynamics  for  many-particle  systems.  Besides,  some  observations  on  special
relativity itself and its experimental facts are also reported. The conclusions from these observations are:
Special  relativity  is  not  an  ultimate  theory;  Some  modification  is  needed;  Any  modification  must  not
violate the constancy of the light speed and the local Lorentz invariance; It seems that we have to change
the assumption on local structures of gravity-free space and time in special relativity.

I. OBSERVATION 1: SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND QUANTUM MECHANICS

Special  relativity  constitutes  the  speed  of  light  as  a  speed  limit  for  the  transport  of  matter  or
energy and the transmission of information or causal connection. Any “faster than c” process between two
events at distant points in space, including instantaneous quantum connection as it appears to be [1-3], is
not  allowed.  In  the  framework  of  special  relativity,  all  particles  are  point-like.  Otherwise,  it  is  hard  to
understand how a finite-sized particle as a whole is set in motion when a force acts on it at its edge, and it
is hard to carry out Lorentz-invariant calculations for such finite-sized particles.

Point-like  nature  of  particles  has  caused  the  divergence  difficulties  in  classical  field  theory,  as
well  as  in  quantum  field  theory.  Indeed,  the  infinite  self-energy  of  a  sizeless  electron  in  quantum
electrodynamics  was  known  as  early  as  1929  [4],  while  it  was  known  in  classical  electrodynamics  even
earlier. Phenomenological substituting several finite experimental values of particle masses and charge for
their infinities  in  theoretical  calculations,  physicists  developed  renormalization  techniques  to  remove  all
divergence in some quantized field systems. However, not all quantized field systems are renormalizable,
and it is difficult to accept such a kind of renormalizability as a basic physical principle to truncate non-
renormalizable  systems.  Feynman  said:  “renormalization  of  a  quantity  gives  up  any  possibility  of
calculating that quantity” [5]. The renormalized quantum field theory fails to explain a class of important
phenomena, mass differences in the groups of neutron-proton, the p -mesons, the K-mesons, the S -baryons
and the X

-baryons.
Physicists created the concepts of one-dimensional extended objects, called strings. Although the
concepts of strings are not contrary to special relativity, string or superstring theories do not get rid of the
divergence  difficulties  [6].  String  or  superstring  theories  still  rely  on  renormalizability  to  eliminate
divergence.

Quantum  field  theory  is  a  theory  founded  on  the  unification  of  special  relativity  and  quantum
mechanics. As it is the case that both classical field theory and quantum  field  theory  are  plagued  by  the
divergence difficulties, the origin of the divergence difficulties seems to lie in special relativity.

II. OBSERVATION 2: SPECIAL RELATIVITY AND STATISTICAL MECHANICS

Special relativity is a part of the laws of Nature. It is natural to try to move statistical mechanics
from its pre-relativistic mechanics base to relativistic mechanics base. This is why the continuous efforts
in  constructing  Lorentz-invariant  statistical  mechanics  and  thermodynamics  for  many-particle  systems

1

began so soon after the birth of special relativity [7-16], though all these efforts ended in failure. So far,
we  have  not  had  an  acceptable  Lorentz-invariant  statistical  mechanics  and  thermodynamics  for  many-
particle systems.

Starting with the four-dimensional Minkowskian space,
dS 2=d

ijdxidxj,  i,j=1,2,3,4,

where  x1=x,  x2=y,  x3=z  and  x4=ict,  c  is  the  speed  of  light,  some  authors  [11-16]  found  the  four-
dimensional tangent space which was further identified with the momentum space,

P2=d

ijpipj,  i,j=1,2,3,4,

where pi=mdxi/dt’, dt’=(1-y2/c2)1/2dt. Having the Minkowskian space and momentum space, they proposed
an eight-dimensional m -space and an 8N-dimensional phase space with constrain,

for each particle. The m -space and phase space are uniform. Their volume elements

ijpipj=-m2c2

and

d4x=dx1dx2dx3dx4

d4p=dp1dp2dp3dp4

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4a)

(4b)

are invariant under the Lorentz transformation.

The uniformity of the m -space and phase space convinces them of Boltzmann’s hypothesis of the
equality of the probability of equal volume element and, hence, of the Boltzmann-like distribution in the
m -space  and  the  Gibbs-like  microcanonical  and  canonical  (after  Gibbs’s  hypothesis)  distributions  in  the
phase space. The invariance of d4x and d4p specifies the  invariant  properties  of  distribution  functions  in
these  distributions  under  the  Lorentz  transformation.  To  determine  the  mentioned  Boltzmann-like  and
Gibbs-like distribution functions, they wanted to find out suitable energy formulas which are invariant.

However, no such energy formulas had been found. The energy of an individual particle is not an
invariant.  It  is  transformed  as  a  component  of  the  momentum-energy  vector.  Total  energy  of  a  many-
particle system is a sum of kinetic energies and interaction energies of its all particles and particle pairs,
at an instant, in the many-particle system. As simultaneity at distant space points in a given inertial frame
of  reference  is  no  longer  simultaneous  in  any  different  inertial  frame  of  reference,  the  transformation
properties of the total energy of the many-particle system are quite indefinite.

Actually, according to Rund [33], the tangent space at a  point  on  a  Riemannian  manifold  is  an
affine space centered at the point. In the case of the Minkowskian manifold, the tangent space coincides
with the manifold itself. But this tangent space is not necessarily identical with the momentum space. In
special relativity, the velocity space is [28-32],
dY2=Hrs(y)dyrdys,  r,s=1,2,3,
Hrs(y)=c2d

rs/(c2-y2)+c2yrys/(c2-y2)2,  real yr and y<c,

(5a)
(5b)

in  the  usual  velocity-coordinates  {yr},  r=1,2,3,  where  yr=dxr/dt  is  the  well-defined  Newtonian  velocity,
y=(yryr)1/2. This velocity space is non-uniform. As a result, the four-dimensional momentum space can not
be uniform, and the m -space  and  phase  space  can  not  be  uniform,  either.  Boltzmann’s  hypothesis  of  the
equality of the probability of equal volume element is no longer appropriate  in  the  framework  of  special
relativity.  Therefore,  we  have  neither  the  Boltzmann-like  nor  the  Gibbs-like  distributions  in  the
framework  of  special  relativity.  It  is  very  tough,  in  the  framework  of  special  relativity,  to  construct
Lorentz-invariant statistical mechanics and thermodynamics for many-particle systems.

III. OBSERVATION 3: EXPERIMENTAL FACTS

Because of technological limitations, in the earlier experiments testing the constancy or isotropy
of  the  speed  of  light,  light  was  propagated  in  a  closed  path.  The  favorite  conclusions  from  these
experiments are obviously for the constancy of the  speed  of  the  round-trip  light,  not  for  that  of  the  one-
way light. As a result of technological advances, many experiments  have  been  performed  in  the  manner
that light propagates in a one-way. Two research groups, of Turner and Hill [17], and of Champeney et al
[18],  placed  a  Co57  source  near  the  rim  of  a  standard  centrifuge  with  an  iron  absorber  near  the  axis  of
rotation. They used the Mossbauer effect to look for any velocity dependence of the frequency of the 14.4
KeV g -rays as seen by the Fe57 in the absorber. They established limits of D c/c<2x10-10 for the anisotropy
in  the  one-way  speed  of  light.  Riis  and  his  colleagues  [19]  compared  the  frequency  of  a  two-photon

transition  in  a  fast  atomic  beam  to  that  of  a  stationary  absorber  while  the  direction  of  the  fast  beam  is
rotated relative to the fixed stars and found the upper limit D c/c<3.5x10-9 firstly and D c/c<2x10-11 later for
the  anisotropy.    The  experiment  of  Krisher  et  al  [20]  was  made  using  highly  stable  hydrogen-maser
frequency standards (clocks) separated by over 21 km and connected by a ultrastable fiber optics link. The
limits  yielded  from  the  experimental  data  are  respectively  D c/c<2x10-7  for  linear  dependency  and
D c/c<2x10-8 for quadratic dependency on the velocity of the Earth with respect to the cosmic microwave
background.

All experimental tests of the constancy  of  the  speed  of  one-way  light  can  also  be  interpreted  as
the  tests  of  the  local  Lorentz  invariance.  Nevertheless,  since  local  Lorentz  non-invariance  implies  a
departure  from  the  Einstein  time  dilation  and  an  existence  of  preferred  inertial  frame  of  reference,  the
experiments  done  by  McGowan  et  al  [21],  Bailey  et  al  [22],  Kaivola  et  al  [23],  Prestage  et  al  [24],  and
Krisher  et  al  [20]  can  be  accounted  as  immediate  testing  of  the  local  Lorentz  invariance.  Bailey  et  al,
Kaivola et al, and McGowan et al verified the Einstein time dilation to an accuracy of 1x10-3, 4x10-5 and
2.3x10-6  respectively.  The  experiments  of  Prestage  et  al  and  Krisher  et  al  are  sensitive  to  the  effects  of
motion of their experimental apparatus relative to a preferred inertial frame of reference and sensitive to
the form of time dilation coefficient of the hydrogen-maser clocks in use. The null results were produced
in these two experiments for breakdown of the local Lorentz invariance.

Experiments  clearly  indicate  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light,  the  Einstein  velocity  addition

law and the local Lorentz invariance.

IV. OBSERVATION 4: SPECIAL RELATIVITY ITSELF

Einstein  published  his  special  theory  of  relativity  in  1905  [25].  He  derived  the  Lorentz
transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  which  is  the  kinematical  background
for the physical principle of the Lorentz invariance. Two fundamental postulates stated by Einstein as the
basis  for  his  theory  are  (i)  the  principle  of  relativity  and  (ii)  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light  in  all
inertial frames of reference.

Conceptually,  the  principle  of  relativity  implies  that  there  exists  a  class  of  equivalent  inertial
frames of reference, any one of which moves with a non-zero constant velocity relative to any other one.
Einstein  wrote:  “in  a  given  inertial  frame  of  reference  the  coordinates  mean  the  results  of  certain
measurements  with  rigid  (motionless)  rods,  a  clock  at  rest  relative  to  the  inertial  frame  of  reference
defines a local time, and the local time at all points of space, indicated by synchronized clocks and taken
together, give the time of this inertial frame of reference.”[26]. As defined by Einstein, each of the inertial
frames  of  reference  is  supplied  with  motionless,  rigid  unit  rods  of  equal  length  and  motionless,
synchronized  clocks  of  equal  running  rate.  Then,  in  each  inertial  frame  of  reference,  an  observer  can
employ his own  motionless-rigid rods and motionless-synchronized  clocks  in  the  so-called  “motionless-
rigid rod and motionless-synchronized clock” measurement method to measure space and time intervals.
By  using  this  “motionless-rigid  rod  and  motionless-synchronized  clock”  measurement  method,  the
observer can set up his own usual inertial coordinate system,  {xr,t},  r=1,2,3,  x1=x,  x2=y,  x3=z.  Postulate
(ii) means that the speed of light is the same constant c in every such usual inertial coordinate system.

Besides  two  postulates  (i)  and  (ii),  special  relativity  also  uses  another  assumption.  This  other
assumption  concerns  the  Euclidean  structure  of  gravity-free  space  and  the  homogeneity  of  gravity-free
time in the usual inertial coordinate system,

rsdxrdxs, r,s=1,2,3,

dX2=d
dT2=dt2,
everywhere and every time.
The assumption Eqs.(6a-6b) and postulates (i) and (ii) together yield the Lorentz transformation
 
between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems.  Indeed,  though  the  assumption  Eqs.(6a-6b)  was  not
explicitly  articulated,  evidently  having  been  considered  self-evident,  Einstein  said  in  1907:  “Since  the
propagation velocity of light in empty space is c with respect to both reference systems, the two equations,
2=0,  must  be  equivalent.”  [7].  Leaving  aside  a  discussion  of
x1
whether  postulate  (i)  implies  the  linearity  of  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative  velocities  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate  systems,  we

know  that  the  two  equivalent  equations,  the  linearity  of  transformation  and  the  reciprocity  of  relative
velocities lead to the Lorentz transformation.

Some  physicists  explicitly  articulated  the  assumption  Eqs.(6a-6b)  in  their  works  on  the  topic.
Pauli wrote: “This also implies the validity of Euclidean geometry and the homogeneous nature of space
and time.” [28], Fock said: “The logical foundation of these methods is, in principle, the hypothesis that
Euclidean geometry is applicable to real physical space together with further assumptions, viz. that rigid
bodies exist and that light travels in straight lines.” [29].

The Minkowskian space Eq.(1) is a four-dimensional version of the assumption Eqs.(6a-6b).
From the assumption Eqs.(6a-6b), one can find
Y2= d

(7)

rsyrys,

where  Y=dX/dT  is  the  velocity-length,  and  yr=dxr/dt,  r=1,2,3,  as  said,  is  the  Newtonian  velocity.  Eq.(7)
embodies the velocity space,

dY2= d

rsdyrdys.

(8)

This velocity space is characterized by boundlessness and the Galilean velocity addition law. On the other
hand,  special  relativity  owns  the  Lorentz  transformation  between  any  two  usual  inertial  coordinate
systems.  That  actually  implies  a  finite  velocity  boundary  at  c  and  the  Einstein  law  governing  velocity
additions, in other words, it is  the  velocity  space  defined  in  Eqs.(5a-5b)  that  stands  in  special  relativity.
We see an inconsistency.

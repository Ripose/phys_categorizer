Abstract

We report the status of the solar neutrino project called HELLAZ. In a high

pressure and cooled TPC filled with helium, the detection of each ionisation electron

of the track produced by the recoil electron from elastic scattering induced by solar

neutrinos, will yield the low energy, high resolution solar neutrino spectrum. Two

topics are presented: tests of Micromegas gas chambers giving a good discrimina-
tion between adjacent ionisation electrons and the preliminary test of the direction

of the primary electron track from the cloud analysis. These two tests seem rather

encouraging.

HELLAZ is a rather ambitious project aimed at measuring the solar neutrino
spectrum with a threshold as low as possible (close to100 keV) and a high resolution
(5%).  The  reaction  used  is  the  elastic  neutrino-electron  scattering,  known  very
accurately over the full energy range. The main aim is to separate the 7Be line from
the pp spectrum, and also, according to the shape of the pp spectrum to be able to
decide which kind of eventual oscillation is taking place.

The  final  detector  shall  be  a  time  projection  chamber  (TPC)  of  2000  m3,
(10 m diameter  and 20 m long, divided in two: the maximum drift being 10 m)
filled with He at 10 bar and cooled to 150K. The choice of helium is dictated by the
facts that the electron drift velocity is low, the electron diffusion is low and it is
possible,  through  boil-off  to  produce  the  gas  totally  immune  from  radioactive
contaminants. The choice of the low temperature comes from the requirement that
the radon should be frozen so that no radioactive source moves in the gas and makes
any subtraction impossible. The target is then 2•1030 electrons, ensuring a yield, if
all neutrinos from the standard solar model are detected, of about 4 7Be and 7 pp
neutrino induced events per day with the low foreseen threshold (100 keV electron
energy, that is 200 keV neutrino energy). The recoil electron makes a track (5 to
50 cm) of ionisation electrons which drift at 1.4 mm/µs under the influence of an
electric  field  (200 V per  cm)  towards  the  2D  end  cap  gas  detector.  The  track  is
reconstructed in 3D and knowing its energy and angle relative to the sun, one is able
to calculate the neutrino energy. Previous reports can be found in [1]. We show here
the status on two parts of the R&D.

Tests with Micromegas chambers

The neutrino energy resolution requires that the electron energy is measured
with a resolution better than 5%, which is not too difficult, and that the recoil direc-
tion of the electron has to be determined to within 2°. This last requirement is difficult.
As a matter of fact, the common use of ADCs to measure the total charge falling on
a wire or a strip of the end cap gaseous detector will yield somewhat inaccurate
results for such low energy tracks. We aim here to gather the maximum possible
information, and for that we plan to measure each individual ionisation electrons. A
track drifting at 1.4 mm/µs contains about 200 electrons per cm.  The diffusion coef-
ficient SD has been measured [2]. Its value in micrometers is:

SD = 200 LD

where LD is the drift length expressed in centimeters. As a matter of fact, this coef-
ficient is measured in the transverse direction and it is assumed up to now that the
longitudinal coefficient equals the transverse. This has still to be checked. In ave-
rage, electrons are separated by some 5 mm. The first incidence is that the X and Y
strips of the detector (we cannot use pads for economic reasons in a 20 m2 surface)
should not be narrower than 2 mm. The second incidence is that the electrons arrive
on these strips with a waiting lines law, that is in e-t/τ as a time function, the function
being linear in the strip width. We immediately see that the shortest the pulses of the
gas detector, the more efficient the system will be to count all electrons one by one.
After  having  tried  different  designs,  we  have  chosen  the  Micromegas
chamber [3]. In this design, the field is constant in the gap between anode and ca-
thode, contrary to the 1/r field around the wire in a usual wire chamber. So, first, the
avalanche is spread over a wider distance, which makes higher gains more easy.

Second, the electrons produced in the avalanche travel a longer distance to the anode,
and, in a slow gas like He, the signal due to the electrons movement is one to two ns
long, and so can be seen with a fast current preamp (Ortec, [4]). Illuminating a Ni-Cr
photocathode with the light of a 250 nm laser, propagated through 2 fibers of different
length, one is able to see 2 pulses separated in time [5]. With such an apparatus, at
one atmosphere and room temperature, we show fig. 1 a pulse where the 2 components
(electrons and positive ions) can clearly be seen. Fig. 2 shows 2 pulses (filtered with
a 50 pf capacitor at the preamp output to remove the slow components) separated by
7 ns. Finally, we show fig. 3 the 0 and 1 photoelectron spectrum recorded by looking

at the amplitude (and not the charge) of the fast pulse. The preamp is here a cheap
home made «common base» designed to replace the Ortec one. The single electron
efficiency here is about 98%.

 The pressure in our vessel is now 10 bar. The mean free path for the propa-
gation of the avalanche is much shorter so that the gap is now 50 µm. We have also
decreased the quantity of CH4 quencher to a few %. Fig. 4. shows a typical pulse: its
width at the base is still well under 10 ns. We have not yet reached a gain such that
we can see single electrons and this is due to a few problems we are in the process of
solving:  first,  the  mesh  (cathode)  suffers  a  pressure  towards  the  anode  about  10
times higher, so we have to control the mesh tension. Second, the cleanness of the
vessel becomes more critical and we have to mount our detectors in a clean room.
Until now, Micromegas chambers at our disposal are only monodimensional.
We have a simple scheme to produce X-Y chambers with an anode printed circuit
deposited on double face kapton. This is based on two interleaved «combs». The
size of the comb teeth has to be analogous to the avalanche spread. We are now
measuring that quantity.

Reconstruction of the electron track

The precision on the angle of the reconstructed track is the second crucial
quest of the experiment feasibility. Extreme caution must be taken, and verifications
have to be done before publishing a meaningful result . We have not reached that
point yet, and what follows is more a description of the actual state of the simula-
tions (which algorithms have been followed) than a final result: all along what follows,
the points towards which a big effort has to be made in order to arrive at a credible
conclusion will be stretched.

The simulations are made with GEANT 3.21. The very first point to check is
the quality of the tracks simulations: the energies are very low (one hundred to a few
hundred keV) and it is maybe one of the very first times where the precise behaviour
of electrons in a high density gas is simulated to be checked experimentally.

The tracks analysis, prior to any drift, shows clearly that the best fit is the
power 3/2 approximation in a plane projection. If the electron is emitted along the z
axis, the orthogonal deviations x and y can be expressed by:

x = a z3/2
y = b z3/2

This is true only when the length of the trajectory tends towards zero. This
law is easy to understand intuitively: the charged particle will deviate from a straight
trajectory of a quantity x (resp. y) proportional to the length z and to the square root
of the number of atomic hits. Practically, this stays a good approximation for a length
varying from 5 to 20 mm when the electron energy varies from 100 to 400 keV. The
precision (σθ) if the interaction vertex is known, is around 1° (@ Ee ≥ 300 keV) and
4° (@ 100 keV). The corresponding values for a linear fit are respectively 2° and 5°.
 However, with the supposition that transverse and longitudinal diffusions are equal,
we can see that after 7 m of drift, the transverse distance between electrons will be
around 1 cm, and so roughly the same as the length of the initial track on which the
power 3/2 fit is performed. The memory of the initial track is thus seriously degraded:
this leads to the use of a longer initial track, including probable «accidents» and the
lowest the initial energy is, the more difficult the problem will be.

An algorithm has been built which allows, by successive approximations to
get a good estimation of the interaction point also called the vertex (sigma is 1-2 mm
for a drift of 4 m ).

In a first step, one tries to reconstruct the track from the cloud, with an ideal
end-cap gas detector. The useful cloud zone around the vertex can be determined in
98% of the cases (tracks of 300 keV with 1 m drift) to 75% (100 keV and 4 m drift).
Most of the miss should be recuperated with a more refined algorithm.

In a second step, under study, one simulates the real gas detector at the end
cap to estimate the losses and the first step is re-done with the effectively measured
electrons.

To conclude on the state of advancement of the track angle reconstruction
program, we show the distributions of the angles between the projections on a plane
of the true direction and the reconstructed direction in the case of 500 electrons of
300 keV and a drift of 100 cm (fig. 5). A gaussian fit yields an uncertainty less than
5° (for 7 tracks, the vertex is clearly not found and only some 10 tracks have problems
-  angle  >  20°). These  uncertainties  are  presented  fig.  6  as  a  function  of  the  drift
length between 0 and 800 cm for 3 energies: 100, 200 and 300 keV. These results

have been produced by linear fits instead of the power 3/2 fits which are slightly
worst, contrary to what was observed with zero drift and a known vertex. Because
the power 3/2 fit is extremely sensitive to the vertex position reconstruction, this
tells us that we do not yet reconstruct the vertex with a sufficient accuracy, for the

diffusion introduced by the drift does not change the shape of the initial electron
track due to elastic scattering, it just washes out the irregularities.

In the near future, we plan to create and measure real low energy electron
tracks in a small TPC (25 cm drift and 100 cm2 detector surface) and inject them in
the reconstruction program.

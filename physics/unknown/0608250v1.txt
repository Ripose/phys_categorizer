Abstract: 
In 1966, the Brazilian physicist Klaus Tausk circulated a preprint from the International Centre for 
Theoretical Physics, in Trieste, criticizing the theory put forward by Daneri, Loinger & Prosperi on the 
measurement problem in quantum mechanics. This led to a heated controversy, which reflected two 
opposing camps within the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory, represented by LØon Rosenfeld 
and Eugene Wigner. But the controversy also went beyond the strictly scientific issues, involving the 
political context of the Cold War, the relations between developed and (cid:147)Third world(cid:148) countries, the 
use of social skills, and personal idiosyncrasies.

Introduction 
 

Klaus Stefan Tausk was born in Graz, Austria, in 1927, and he emigrated with his 

Jewish family to Sªo Paulo, Brazil, in 1938. His name is virtually unknown among physicists 

and historians of science. Yet, he was one of the protagonists of a controversy that helped to 

establish the field of foundations of quantum mechanics. In 1966, while in Trieste, Italy, he 

circulated a preprint criticizing, with some original arguments, a paper by Daneri, Prosperi & 

Loinger.1 Tausk(cid:146)s article produced a heated controversy that went well beyond the strictly 

scientific issue. Many physicists, such as Rosenfeld, Bohm, Jauch and Bell, took sides on the 

merits of Tausk(cid:146)s criticism. Eventually, Tausk(cid:146)s work was neglected and forgotten even by 

those who used it to advance their own interpretations.  

Why did this happen? In our view, Tausk(cid:146)s failure may be attributed to his careless 

style of writing and lack of adequate social skills for communicating his ideas. On the other 

hand, his lack of success was also conditioned by the circumstances of the ongoing debate in 

the field of foundations of quantum mechanics, by the lack of respect of this field in the eyes 

of most physicists at the time, and also by the controversial reputation (cid:150) due to its publication 

policy (cid:150) of the institution from which Tausk circulated his preprint.  

Scientific controversies have been the focus of much interest in recent history and 

philosophy of science.2 McMullin3 has emphasized that a scientific controversy is much more 

than a logical problem involving hypotheses and evidence, it is a social conflict in a historical 

situation, involving personality traits and other historical contingencies. Thus, to understand 

the Tausk controversy, one must examine not only the scientific issues at stake, but also the 

historical and ideological circumstances at the time.  

Quantum theory had already been the focus of controversy, in the debates between 

Bohr and Einstein (1927-35), in the Soviet Union, and in the 1950(cid:146)s, especially after the 

 

2

appearance of David Bohm(cid:146)s 1952 (cid:147)causal interpretation(cid:148), which offered a deterministic picture 

based on (cid:147)hidden variables(cid:148). The controversy involving hidden variables was set in the political 

context of the Cold War,4 which also affected the Tausk controversy. But, in addition, this 

case involved politics of a different kind, that between scientific centers of developed 

countries and of the (cid:147)Third World(cid:148). In this case, the tension between (cid:147)North(cid:148) and (cid:147)South(cid:148) was 

mediated by the concrete institutional setting of the International Centre for Theoretical 

Physics, in Trieste. 

 

 

The Scientific Background 

 

 

The discussion around Tausk(cid:146)s preprint involves the so-called (cid:147)measurement problem(cid:148), 

one of the main subjects in the foundations of quantum mechanics.5 In the 1950(cid:146)s, two broad 

points of view divided the theoretical physicists who took an interest in the problem. Setting 

aside more heterodox proposals, such as Bohm(cid:146)s causal interpretation or Hugh Everett(cid:146)s 1957 

relative state interpretation, the two (cid:147)orthodox(cid:148) camps were the following. 

On one side, physicists such as John von Neumann, Georg S(cid:252)ssmann, and Eugene 

Wigner described the measurement apparatus, used in quantum-mechanical experiments, in 

an exact way (i.e. without approximations) as a quantum system. This approach, sometimes 

called the (cid:147)Princeton interpretation(cid:148),6 applied the Schr(cid:246)dinger equation (or another equivalent 

equation describing a (cid:147)unitary(cid:148) state evolution) to the composite system consisting of apparatus 

and quantum object, and concluded that such a description is insufficient for accounting for 

all the aspects of the measurement process. This formal result became known as an 

(cid:147)insolubility proof(cid:148) for the measurement problem. It was first derived by von Neumann in 1932, 

and served as a justification for the introduction of his (cid:147)projection postulate(cid:148), which describes 

3

the change of state, accompanying a measurement, as an indeterministic process. Therefore, 

the projection postulate would be an independent principle, to be added to the five (or six, if 

one considers indistinguishable particles) fundamental axioms of non-relativistic quantum 

mechanics.7 What was prohibited by the insolubility proofs, reformulated by Wigner8 (1963) 

and others, was the reduction of the projection postulate to the other axioms.  

On the other side, physicists such as Niels Bohr (after World War II), Pascual Jordan 

(after the War), G(cid:252)nther Ludwig, Paul Feyerabend, H.S. Green, Angelo Loinger, Giovanni 

Maria Prosperi, and LØon Rosenfeld, besides others, argued that the measurement process 

could be adequately described by a statistical mechanics of quantum processes, which would 

amount to a thermodynamical approach. The physicists involved were very close to the 

orthodox (cid:147)Copenhagen interpretation(cid:148), centered around the notion of (cid:147)complementarity(cid:148),9 but 

their proposal involved a modification of the original view developed by Bohr, Werner 

Heisenberg and Wolfgang Pauli, between 1928 and 1935. As is usual in statistical mechanics, 

certain approximations (in the limit of large numbers) had to be introduced. Some authors, 

such as Jordan10 (1949), pointed out clearly the statistical hypothesis being used, and 

proposed simply to substitute such a hypothesis for the projection postulate. Others, such as 

Daneri, Loinger & Prosperi (1962), did not consider that the approximations involved any 

fundamental physical principle, so that their work would amount to the elimination of the 

additional postulate (the projection postulate), reducing it to the others. This clashed with the 

result of the insolubility proofs and stirred up the debate on the (cid:147)measurement problem(cid:148), which 

began in 1957 with the discussion between S(cid:252)ssmann and Feyerabend at the Colston 

Symposium.11 

The thermodynamical approach had arisen after World War II as an (cid:147)objectivist(cid:148) 

alternative to the idealistic views that were widespread in the 1930(cid:146)s. This change of position 

appears clearly in Niels Bohr, who now stressed that a measurement could be completed 

 

4

without the presence of a conscious observer, (cid:147)based on registrations obtained by means of 

suitable amplification devices with irreversible functioning(cid:148).12 The idea was that a 

measurement is an objective thermodynamical process. The problem left open was how to 

mathematically describe, in the most satisfactory way, this process of irreversible 

amplification which leads from a microscopic event to a macroscopic registration. 

The most ambitious work on this thermodynamical amplification approach was the 

theory proposed, in 1962, by Adriana Daneri, Angelo Loinger & Giovanni Maria Prosperi 

(DLP), from the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, section Milan, and published in the 

periodical Nuclear Physics, edited by LØon Rosenfeld. They divided the measurement process 

into two stages. First, the microscopic quantum object interacts with the apparatus prepared in 

a (cid:147)metastable(cid:148) state, leading to a non-equilibrium state. In the second stage, amplification takes 

place, involving certain restrictions known as (cid:147)ergodicity conditions(cid:148). The ergodicity conditions 

used by DLP were weaker than those used in previous works, and were defined by Leon van 

Hove. They guaranteed that the system would return to equilibrium, according to the expected 

behavior of the measurement apparatus, in the limit of infinite times. Rosenfeld approved of 

DLP(cid:146)s work, emphasizing the importance of the second stage, which would involve 

amplification.13 

The theory of DLP was the result of a series of investigations undertaken since the end 

of the 1950(cid:146)s by Italian theoretical physicists, such as Loinger, Prosperi, Pietro Bocchieri, and 

Antonio Scotti, from Pavia and Milan, on the ergodic theorem and its applications in 

statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Specifically, the search for a more realist 

solution to the measurement problem, in opposition to the solution given by von Neumann, 

was inspired by the direct influence of the Italian theoretical physicist Piero Caldirola, who 

helped popularizing DLP(cid:146)s theory. DLP(cid:146)s paper was met with much interest.14 

 

5

Slowly, however, the thermodynamical approach declined, basically for two reasons. 

First there were the arguments given by Wigner (1963) and others, based on the insolubility 

proofs, as mentioned above. The second argument was first given by Tausk (1966), and later 

by Jauch, Wigner & Yanase (1967), and was based on the (cid:147)null-result measurements(cid:148), 

examined by Mauritius Renninger.15 One may explain such class of measurements as follows. 

Imagine an experiment in which a quantum-mechanical object (we(cid:146)ll call it a (cid:147)particle(cid:148), but 

without requiring that it has well defined positions) could fall (with equal probability) on one 

of two detectors, placed respectively on paths A and B. Suppose now that the detector on path 

A is removed, and that the particle is sent to the apparatus. If, after a certain time, the observer 

does not see any signal at the detector maintained on path B (assuming perfectly efficient 

detectors), he would conclude that the particle traveled through path A, which amounts to a 

state reduction or collapse. However, there was no amplification! This shows clearly that 

amplification is not a necessary condition for state reduction (although it might be, in practice, 

a sufficient condition).  

Although Tausk(cid:146)s argument, based on null-result measurements, was seen by many 

(via Jauch et al.(cid:146)s 1967 paper) as a knock-down argument against DLP, Loinger (1968) would 

defend his theory, showing that it did not require that an amplification take place. What his 

formalism required was only the existence of a coupling between detector and quantum 

object, a situation that would be later clarified by Dicke.16 

Tausk in Trieste 

 

 

 

 

Tausk studied physics at the University of Sªo Paulo in the period 1947-51. After that, 

he worked in experiments with cosmic rays with the American Kurt Sitte. Tausk became 

6

acquainted with David Bohm, who worked at the University of Sªo Paulo from October 1951 

to January 1955. Klaus claims that Bohm(cid:146)s causal interpretation did not influence him, since at 

the time he did not have an adequate understanding of quantum mechanics17. After a few 

years away from physics, Tausk began his graduate research in 1958, which included 

traveling to Hamburg (1959-60) to work with Harry Lehman, on quantum field theory. There 

he met Georg S(cid:252)ssmann, who worked in Frankfurt, and was doing significant work in the 

measurement theory of quantum mechanics.18  

Back to Sªo Paulo, in 1962, Tausk read a paper by Hitoshi Wakita (1960) on the 

measurement problem in quantum mechanics and became interested in the subject. Tausk then 

found the paper by Renninger (1960) on (cid:147)null-result measurements(cid:148), which he would use in the 

criticism that would lead to the controversy studied here, as explained above. Renninger used 

this thought-experiment to criticize the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, denying 

the notion that every measurement produces an uncontrollable disturbance on the object.19 At 

this time, Tausk also started to question the orthodox interpretation (especially the 

Copenhagen version) and proceeded to work on the measurement problem.  

In 1965, Tausk wrote to Abdus Salam, director of the International Centre for 

Theoretical Physics (ICTP), in Trieste, Italy, and was granted a scholarship. He was presented 

as a doctorate student of the Brazilian theoretical physicist Mario Sch(cid:246)nberg, one of the most 

renowned scientists in Brazil at the time. The ICTP had been created in June, 1963, as a 

division of the International Atomic Energy Agency, with the support of UNESCO. The ICTP 

was in a delicate position at the time, for it was created under the opposition of India, Soviet 

Union, United States and most of the developed countries. The director of the International 

Atomic Energy Agency was Sigvard Eklund, a friend of Rosenfeld. During the negotiations to 

create the ICTP in Trieste, Rosenfeld had proposed Copenhagen to establish the ICTP. The 

Danish physicists thought that the International Atomic Energy Agency should support 

 

7

regional institutions such as the Nordisk Institut for Teoretisk Atomfysik (Nordita), in 

Copenhagen, and were skeptical about the importance of supporting theoretical physics for 

Third World development.20  

Tausk spent a year in Trieste, from mid-1965 to the end of September, 1966. He was 

accepted to work on a research proposal on quantum field theory, but in fact what he did was 

continue his studies on the measurement problem. At the end of his stay he finished a paper 

entitled (cid:147)Relation of Measurement with Ergodicity, Macroscopic Systems, Information and 

Conservation Laws(cid:148), which criticized the aforementioned paper by Daneri, Loinger & Prosperi 

(1962), as well as the orthodox interpretation (especially the version presented by Heisenberg, 

1958). He also criticized a new preprint of the Milanese group, which circulated in February, 

1966.21 Tausk(cid:146)s paper was written as a thesis for the International Advanced School of 

Physics, a subdivision of the ICTP, headed at the time by Luciano Fonda.22 It started 

circulating in August, 1966.  

As a scientist working at the Institute, Tausk had the right to request that his paper be 

typed and 50 copies be printed as an internal report of the ICTP, without any refereeing. 

Tausk also added an official ICTP cover to the report, which was not a usual procedure. Later 

he apologized, blaming this procedure on his (cid:147)ignorance of the regulations, a series of 

misunderstandings and to the absence of part of the staff from the Centre at the time [...](cid:148).23 

He distributed the paper to a number of physicists, including S(cid:252)ssmann, Daniele 

Amati (an Argentinian physicist who had studied a few years in Rio de Janeiro and worked in 

Trieste), Jeffrey Bub (University of Minnesota), and Jean-Pierre Vigier, from Paris, who 

Tausk had met in Sªo Paulo when the French Marxist went to work with Bohm, in 1954. 

Tausk had reencountered Vigier in Trieste, and had received an offer to work with Vigier and 

Louis de Broglie at the Institut Henri PoincarØ in Paris, on the measurement theory in 

quantum mechanics. 

 

8

Tausk also sent the paper to Loinger, who was now at the Universit(cid:224) degli Studi di 

Pavia, and it arrived in Rosenfeld(cid:146)s hands, who worked at Nordita, in Copenhagen. Rosenfeld 

had written a paper13 explicitly defending DLP(cid:146)s theory, and was also criticized by Tausk. 

Both Loinger and Rosenfeld not only disagreed with Tausk, but were enraged at the paper.  

Daneri et al.24 had considered their work (cid:147)an indispensable completion and a natural 

crowning of the basic structure of present-day quantum mechanics(cid:148), and were convinced that 

(cid:147)further progresses in this field of research will consist essentially in refinements(cid:148) of their 

approach.  The rhetorical aspects of such an immodest claimed should be noticed. Tausk25, in 

contrast, concluded that, contrary to DLP(cid:146)s thesis, (cid:147)no connection between ergodicity and 

reduction of state has been established(cid:148), pointing to a class of measurements, the null-result 

measurements of Renninger, (cid:147)for which ergodicity considerations are obviously irrelevant(cid:148).  

(cid:147)Recent claims by the same authors [...] and L. Rosenfeld [...], which hold this attempt to be of 

fundamental importance, are thereby contradicted.(cid:148) (See further comments in the Appendix to 

the present paper, on both the content of Tausk(cid:146)s argument and his style.) 

 

 

 

 

The Attacks by Loinger and Rosenfeld 

The first to publicly react to Tausk(cid:146)s preprint was Loinger. On Sept. 9, 1966, he wrote 

an open letter26 to Gilberto Bernardini, President of the Societ(cid:224) Italiana di Fisica (SIF), which 

he asked to be published in the Bollettino della S.I.F. In this letter, written in Italian, he 

deplored the growing number of valueless preprints appearing from different institutions 

(having in mind especially the ICTP in Trieste), and being submitted to the Il Nuovo Cimento, 

the official journal of the SIF. He then offered two suggestions to the Society. First, the 

Nuovo Cimento should publish the title, author and institution of all papers refused by the 

9

journal, as a way of forcing institutions to control the quantity of useless papers being 

released. Second, the SIF should constitute an (cid:147)antiprize(cid:148) (antipremio) for the worst preprint 

written in Italy! And as his suggestion for the preprint (cid:147)that should not let the first antiprize 

escape(cid:148) was Tausk(cid:146)s  preprint! 

Loinger(cid:146)s attack was directed not only to Tausk(cid:146)s critical article, but also to the ICTP as 

a whole. Around that same time, he had sent an open letter27 to the Italian magazine 

L(cid:146)Europeo, of broad circulation, questioning the financial support given by the Italian 

government to the ICTP and criticizing the doubtful rigor of the papers originating in the 

Centre. The opinion that the ICTP did not exert any control over its preprints was consensual 

among European and American physicists. In fact, this lack of internal control was intended: 

Salam, director of the ICTP, wanted to maximize the publication opportunities of the 

scientists of the Third World.28 

On Sept. 20, Rosenfeld wrote a letter to Salam, calling his attention to Tausk(cid:146)s preprint. 

Rosenfeld(cid:146)s communication began tacitly but clearly questioning the publication policy 

adopted at the ICTP. (cid:147)From the inexhaustible flow of preprints from your Institute I picked out the 

other day one with the somewhat bombastic title (cid:145)Relation of Measurement with Ergodicity, 

Macroscopic Systems, Information and Conservation Laws(cid:146) by a certain K.S. Tausk(cid:148).29 Certainly 

such an introduction, from an authority like Rosenfeld who had raised doubts around the 

creation of the ICTP in Trieste, would intimidate Salam, who was striving to demonstrate that 

his institute was worth supporting for its scientific merits.  

Then, Rosenfeld went on, with bold rhetoric: (cid:147)[...] it is such incredible trash that I 

hardly could believe my eyes when I read it. I feel that I ought to write you about it in the 

event that (as I hope) this masterpiece has just escaped your attention [...] The author is, I 

suppose, very young and inexperienced; one good turn you could do him, since you 

presumably know him better than I do, would be to represent that before blandly assuming 

 

10

that the trivialities which fill his paper could have been overlooked by such people as Niels 

Bohr and Heisenberg, he might perhaps reflect that he could be the one who misses the 

point(cid:148).29 Note, again, the reference to a possible lack of control at the ICTP regarding their 

preprints.  

A week later Salam wrote back to Rosenfeld: (cid:147)I wish to tender to you my sincerest 

apologies for Mr. Tausk(cid:146)s paper which reached you(cid:148). He explained the rules for publishing 

preprints at the ICTP and how Tausk managed to put a cover on his internal report. (cid:147)Mr. Tausk 

is a special pupil of Mario Sch(cid:246)nberg in Brazil. I have not had a chance to see him yet. He is 

due to leave us at the end of this month to join the Vigier group in Paris. I would request you 

that you may consider this episode as part of the old battles and in no case an expression of 

opinion from the Centre here(cid:148).30 

The (cid:147)old battles(cid:148) to which he refers are the controversies involving the interpretations of 

quantum theory. Rosenfeld was appeased: (cid:147)Since, however, this is clearly a case of lack of 

foresight with no evil intent on his part, I think one ought not be too severe with him and 

rather dismiss the whole matter without more ado. I am glad to know (for the centre(cid:146)s sake) 

that Tausk(cid:146)s paper will not receive more publicity from the centre, but I have no illusions 

about what the Vigier group is going to do with it. However, this is another story(cid:148).31 

With this move, Salam had been neutralized by Rosenfeld. Tausk would not be 

supported by the director of the institute that had circulated his work. This was the beginning 

of Tausk(cid:146)s isolation. 

The Defenses of Bohm, Jauch and of the International Advanced School of Physics 

 

 

 

 

11

Meanwhile, Fonda, director of the International Advanced School of Physics, wrote to 

two renowned experts in the foundations of quantum mechanics for an opinion. On Sept. 26, 

David Bohm, then at Birkbeck College, University of London, wrote a brief handwritten letter 

to Fonda (c.c. to Salam, Tausk and Paolo Budini, then Deputy-director of the ICTP): (cid:147)I have 

read Dr. Tausk(cid:146)s paper, and I feel that what he writes is correct. I myself would suggest that he 

should publish his paper as a short article(cid:148). A week later he would write to Tausk a three-page 

typed letter, in which he clarified (cid:147)the confusion between the individual and the ensemble, 

which is contained in the argument of DLP(cid:148).32 One might ask whether Bohm(cid:146)s support was 

useful or, rather, raised more doubts around Tausk(cid:146)s work. Given his heterodox position 

concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics, Bohm(cid:146)s opinion might not have carried 

much weight at the time for most of the scientists interested in the issue.  

The other referee was Josef Maria Jauch, from the UniversitØ de GenŁve, Switzerland. 

He agreed that a (cid:147)criticism of the paper by Daneri et al. is certainly most useful(cid:148), and agreed 

with Tausk(cid:146)s conclusion that (cid:147)no connection between ergodic properties of the measuring 

apparatus and the reduction of state has been established by DLP(cid:148). Yet, Jauch found certain 

statements in Tausk(cid:146)s paper unclear, a few arguments badly constructed, and complained about 

the lack of more complete references (to Wigner(cid:146)s 1963 and Jauch(cid:146)s 1964 papers). (cid:147)In 

conclusion, I should say that a paper in this form would not be permitted to leave my institute. In the 

other hand a criticism of Daneri et al. is necessary and could be made in a more objective and 

dignified way on several grounds. [...](cid:148)33 

 Tausk spoke with Salam, who showed him Rosenfeld(cid:146)s letter. Tausk wrote to 

Rosenfeld assuming responsibility for unwillingly breaking the rules of publication of the 

ICTP. But added: (cid:147)Fortunately for my reputation your opinion about my paper is not universal among 

those who have given serious thought to the problem of measurement: Prof. David Bohm thinks that 

what I wrote is correct, and he advised me to publish it. Prof. Louis de Broglie has sent me one of his 

 

12

books with the inscription (cid:145)avec l(cid:146)homage de l(cid:146)auteur(cid:146) in acknowledgment of this paper. A letter from 

Prof. G. S(cid:252)ssmann contains the following : (cid:145)Ihre Arbeit habe ich mit groβem Interesse gelesen. Was 

Sie zu DPLI und zu Rosenfelds Kommentar sagen, leuchtet mir durchaus ein.(cid:146) [...](cid:148)34  

In view of the letters of the two referees (Bohm and Jauch), Amati, Budini & Fonda 

(1966), on behalf of the International Advanced School of Physics, wrote an open letter (in 

Italian) to the Societ(cid:224) Italiana di Fisica, arguing against the institution of an antiprize for the 

worst paper, mainly because (cid:147)it could easily be the cause or the effect of personal issues. For 

example, the work of Tausk, indicated by Loinger as worthy of the year(cid:146)s antiprize, contains a 

severe criticism of a paper by Loinger himself, co-authored by Daneri and Prosperi(cid:148).35 

They then make reference to Tausk(cid:146)s paper, summarizing the opinions of Bohm and 

Jauch. Loinger replied angrily to the (cid:147)stupefying open letter(cid:148) of Amati, Budini and Fonda, 

maintaining his original position, and writing that (cid:147)if Bohm and Jauch have really declared, 

with respect to the aforementioned masterpiece, what Amati, Budini, and Fonda claim, then 

they lost an excellent opportunity to remain quiet(cid:148).36 

On October 17, Fonda wrote the following letter to Tausk: (cid:147)I have received the answer 

from Jauch and I see that he agrees with you on your criticism to Loinger(cid:146)s paper. I have 

agreed with professor Budini that your paper will be supported by the Advanced School of 

Physics; however, in that case we want you to take into account the suggestions and criticism 

of professor Jauch to your manuscript. Once you have revised your manuscript, please send it 

to me and I will forward it to the journal you prefer(cid:148).37 

Tausk17 claimed he never received Jauch(cid:146)s letter. He did not revise his manuscript or 

send it back to the International Advanced School of Physics. He claimed that, later, he 

submitted the article to the American Journal of Physics, but it was turned down by two 

referees.

Further Developments 

Tausk was unaware that his paper was passed by Amati to the Northern Irish John 

Stewart Bell, of the Conseil EuropØen pour la Recherche de NuclØaire (CERN), in Geneva, 

who had also received Loinger(cid:146)s reprints. On October 26, Bell wrote to Loinger: (cid:147)It appears to 

me that ergodicity is relevant in showing the approximate absence of interference phenomena 

with macroscopically different states. But I think that nobody doubted this, and so am unable 

to attach fundamental importance to the formal discussion. This feature of large systems is for 

me about as relevant to the question of principle as is, for example, apparent macroscopic 

irreversibility to the question of reversibility of the fundamental Hamiltonian. [...] I am unable 

to accept all the details of Tausk as justified criticism of your paper. But I think his main 

points are right, and his general position sound(cid:148). To this, Loinger answered harshly: (cid:147)Dear Prof. 

Bell, I think that you have not understood the essence of the problem of quantal measurement. 

Yours sincerely, A. Loinger(cid:148). The irony is that Bell, with his paper published two years earlier, 

was becoming the most important name in the foundations of quantum physics.38 

In November, Tausk received a reply from Jeffrey Bub, a South-African physicist who 

was then a post-doctorate in Minnesota. Bub had received a letter from Loinger containing 

some criticisms of his paper with Bohm, and he replied to the Italian physicist reproducing 

many of the ideas of Tausk(cid:146)s argument. Bub wrote to Tausk that his article (cid:147)clarified several 

points which I had not understood properly before(cid:148). The only citation of Tausk(cid:146)s preprint to 

appear in the literature would be in the criticism by Bub of the DLP theory of measurement: 

(cid:147)certain aspects of the following analysis have been influenced by a critical article by K.S. 

Tausk(cid:148).39 

14

In 1967, Jauch, Eugene Wigner and Mutsuo Yanase published a paper (sent in late 

November, 1966) thoroughly criticizing DLP. They mentioned the problem involving null-

result measurements without mentioning Tausk, who was the actual originator of this idea, 

which Jauch picked up while reviewing Tausk(cid:146)s preprint. Jauch had informed Wigner of the 

existence of Tausk(cid:146)s work: (cid:147)I should perhaps mention that there has recently appeared an 

internal report from Triestre (ICTP internal Report 14/1966) written by K.S. Tausk which 

criticizes the paper by Daneri et al. rather severely. This paper contains some interesting 

points which should perhaps also be discussed in our paper(cid:148).40  

Wigner did not mention this information in subsequent letters. The first version of the 

paper was written by Wigner, and Jauch made the final modifications.41 It was Jauch who 

should have introduced a reference to Tausk(cid:146)s preprint, known to him but not to Wigner and 

Yanase, but he did not do so.  

Franco Selleri (to whom we will return in the next section) would later comment on 

this lack of citation: (cid:147)This is a further example (I had some myself) of how some well known 

physicists are eager of appropriating contributions coming from authors when they judge it 

safe to do so(cid:148).42  

Why wasn(cid:146)t Tausk(cid:146)s paper even mentioned in Jauch et al.(cid:146)s paper? Perhaps because of a 

vague depreciatory image of him which might have circulated among the European scientific 

community, which pictured him as being an unqualified Third-World physicist, a polemist 

who criticizes the orthodoxy without understanding it, a sympathizer of the Vigier group. 

Besides, Jauch et al. might not have wanted to align themselves and their work with one of 

the numerous ICTP preprints, especially a controversial one written by a virtually unknown 

physicist.

Back to Brazil 

 

 

After spending some time in Graz, Klaus returned to Sªo Paulo to finish his Ph.D. His 

advisor, Mario Sch(cid:246)nberg, was very mad with him, due to the (cid:147)scandal(cid:148) in Europe. Sch(cid:246)nberg 

was a long-time friend of Rosenfeld, both in science (cid:150) in cosmic ray physics (cid:150) and in politics (cid:150) in 

the Peace Movement Committee, for both were Marxists.  Sch(cid:246)nberg was also a close friend 

of Piero Caldirola, whom he met in 1938, in Rome.43 Sch(cid:246)nberg might have received a letter 

from Rosenfeld (or Salam, or even Caldirola), and felt embarrassed at what his student had 

done.  

Tausk worked alone and finished writing his thesis, in Portuguese. Besides the 

material contained in his controversial preprint, Tausk included a chapter in which he showed 

(possibly for the first time) that the non-locality in correlated systems cannot be used to 

transmit signals. Sometime in 1967, in a first discussion of his work with an advisory 

committee (equivalent to a qualifying examination), which also included the physicists 

Ant(cid:244)nio Piza and Yogiro Hama, his work was severely criticized by Sch(cid:246)nberg. The 

committee concluded that the thesis could not be defended as it was, and certain parts would 

have to be rewritten.17 

The thesis44 defense, which took place a few months later, turned out to be another 

traumatic experience for Klaus.  He defended without an advisor, since Sch(cid:246)nberg, according 

to Tausk, would not talk to him. The examining board almost flunked him, and the important 

Brazilian theoretical physicist Jorge Swieca, then at the Universidade de Sªo Paulo, was very 

critical of Tausk(cid:146)s work. 

According to Tausk17, the only Brazilian physicist who read and approved of his work 

was the renowned experimental physicist Cesare Lattes, of the Universidade Estadual de 

Campinas. After his defense, Lattes phoned him and asked for a copy of his thesis, which he 

16

read overnight and gave his approval by telephone. That judgment, however, probably did not 

have much influence on the opinion of other Brazilian physicists. 

A few years later, in 1972, Franco Selleri, of the Universit(cid:224) di Bari, by then 

completely involved with the foundations of quantum theory, visited the Universidade de Sªo 

Paulo, on invitation by the theoretical physicist Henrique Fleming. Selleri wrote a review of 

Tausk(cid:146)s thesis. His comments followed the tone of Bohm(cid:146)s and Jauch(cid:146)s, pointing to certain 

misunderstandings of the author but being overall sympathetic to his views. He pointed out 

eight original contributions of Tausk, and four weak points. (cid:147)In conclusion Tausk(cid:146)s thesis was a 

very interesting reading and many physicists could no doubt benefit from it, once cleared up 

the philosophical ambiguities. With more self-criticism Tausk will probably be able to 

contribute significantly to the understanding of the structure of the physical world(cid:148).42    

 

 

 

 

Tausk in the Context of the Wigner-Rosenfeld Dispute 

The irate reaction of Loinger and Rosenfeld to Tausk(cid:146)s preprint cannot be fully 

understood without reference to the context of the dispute in which these two physicists were 

involved at the moment in which Tausk(cid:146)s preprint started circulating. The thermodynamical 

amplification program for solving the measurement problem, which had risen in the 50(cid:146)s and 

beginning of the 60(cid:146)s, reached its most developed form with DLP(cid:146)s work and with the support 

given by Rosenfeld. However, this program was criticized by a few theoreticians, especially 

Wigner, who followed von Neumann(cid:146)s approach of describing the measurement apparatus as a 

quantum mechanical closed system8, and who suggested that human consciousness would 

have an uneliminable role in the reduction of the (cid:147)wave packet(cid:148). 

17

Daneri et al. published their second paper, in 1966, as a response to this and other 

criticisms, raising the temperature of the controversy as they stated that authors like Wigner, 

Abner Shimony, P.A. Moldauer, Yanase, and Jauch had not given (cid:147)new substantial 

contributions to the subject [the measurement problem](cid:148). This paper of the Italian physicists, 

quoted and criticized in Tausk(cid:146)s preprint, irritated Wigner. He wrote the following to Jauch.45  

(cid:147)I just finished reading the article of Daneri Loinger and Prosperi in the July issue of 

Nuovo Cimento and am really a bit irritated by it.  First of all, it is not good taste to say about 

a set of articles that they do not make substantial contributions to a subject. Needless to say, I 

am less concerned about myself than about other people who are much younger than I am and 

whose future careers such statements may hurt. [...] I am also saddened by Rosenfeld(cid:146)s 

endorsement of the article which, after all, considers it axiomatic that macroscopic systems 

have only states which can be described by classical mechanics. This is, of course, in conflict 

with quantum mechanics, [...](cid:148). 

Wigner was concerned with the careers of Yanase and Shimony, to whom he had 

served as doctoral advisor. He thus articulated with Jauch the response sent to the Nuovo 

Cimento already in December of the same year.  

The perception of the intensity of the dispute is evident in the words of Otto Robert 

Frisch, experimental physicist, in an opening lecture given in 1968 at a meeting on the 

foundations of quantum theory. (cid:147)I understand that at present there exists a controversy, roughly 

speaking, between a group of people which includes Wigner as the best known person and 

another group centred on Milan [DLP], and that these two have different views on how this 

reduction [of the wave function during a measurement] happens(cid:148).46 

The harshness of the dispute facing Wigner, on one side, and Rosenfeld on the other, 

may be explained by the various issues involved. Besides the strictly scientific aspects, it 

involved a dispute over the intellectual legacy (cid:150) with respect to the foundations and 

 

18

interpretation of quantum theory (cid:150) of the founding fathers of this theory, with Wigner 

emphasizing von Neumann(cid:146)s point of view and Rosenfeld defending Bohr(cid:146)s view. This 

involved a difference in scientific styles concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics, 

with Wigner stressing the axiomatization and Rosenfeld a more phenomenological approach. 

There was also a marked divergence in the political and ideological terrain, with Wigner an 

idealist, aligned with the American right-wing and with the support of the armed race, while 

Rosenfeld was a Marxist, associated to peace and disarmament movements.47 This ideological 

dimension of the controversy in quantum physics was common at the time, and we can find 

significant reference to it in the words of the same Frisch, mentioned above, in a letter to his 

cousin Hugo Tausk, who happens to be Klaus(cid:146) father, in September, 1967. 

(cid:147)[...] I have occupied myself a few times with Tausk(cid:146)s work, but I am not a theoretician and 

could not follow it. The questions which he addresses (essentially the question of the reality of the 

external world) seems to me very interesting. The orthodox Copenhagen interpretation says that 

physics does not deal with things but with measurements. That tastes like idealism, and is therefore 

rejected by the communists. Vice versa also applies, since anyone here in the West who doubts the 

orthodox interpretation (cid:150) even for objective reasons (cid:150) is suspect of communism. All this with the 

complexities and meaninglessness of a religious war, complete with converts: the greatest defender of 

the orthodoxy is a communist [Rosenfeld], and many of the opposers are fully bourgeoise [...](cid:148).48 

Tausk, with his preprint distributed in August, 1966, entered the scene of this dispute 

aligning himself, perhaps without being fully aware of it, with the critics of Rosenfeld, 

Daneri, Loinger, and Prosperi, like Wigner and Jauch. 

On the other hand, the intensity of the dispute between Wigner and Rosenfeld seems 

to have contributed strongly for the acceptance, among physicists, of the problems in the 

foundations of quantum theory as a legitimate field of research in physics.47 It is ironic that 

 

19

Tausk contributed to legitimize a field of research in which he would no longer act as a 

relevant protagonist. 

Conclusion 

 

Tausk(cid:146)s possibly promising career in the foundations of physics was not fulfilled. In 

Europe he had made a bad name for himself, in Brazil his field of study was not considered 

relevant (even in Europe and in other developed countries, the field of foundations of physics 

would only gain respect in the 1970(cid:146)s47). He did not receive adequate counseling from an 

advisor, and was unable to revise his 1966 preprint and publish it, or publish other original 

ideas from his dissertation. The slightly aggressive or arrogant style (not very (cid:147)dignified(cid:148), 

according to Jauch, see section 4) of his preprint contributed to this negative image, indicating 

the importance of psychological factors for the explanation of certain scientific episodes.  

He asked the Conselho Nacional de Pesquisa (CNPq) for another scholarship to work 

with Vigier, and it was granted.49 Tausk went to Paris, in 1968, but was unable to do much 

work due to the strikes and political turmoil. Back to Brazil, Tausk engaged in a not very 

expressive career, concentrating on his classes (he created a course on Groups and Tensors) 

and publishing very little. He became a slightly folkloric figure at the Physics Institute of the 

University of Sªo Paulo, but his personality traits did not bring him much sympathy.  

We would like to point out that Tausk only received private communications 

supporting his work. When he was attacked the only documents he could show were letters or 

a dedicated book, coming from scientists that were considered heterodox themselves. These 

instruments are too weak for a young and unknown scientist. His (cid:147)tragedy(cid:148) was not being in the 

20

 

 

 

centre of a controversy, but precisely that he and his work were utterly ignored in the public 

sphere. 

Tausk might be considered a kind of anti-hero of modern physics. True, he did 

actually have original insights, which were incorporated into the growing field of the 

foundations of physics, by means of the manuscript that was not published but was read by 

physicists who played a relevant role in the field. But he came from the Third World, started 

late in his career, chose a field which at that time had little prestige, was unable to benefit 

from an advisor, made a few errors in his paper, was unable to publish in respected journals, 

and had a unamiable personality. Physicists must learn how to write papers, which entails 

using the appropriate format, language, assumptions and degree of mathematical detail that 

are accepted by the members of each sub-discipline. Tausk lacked this ability. His supervisor, 

Sch(cid:246)nberg, decided to align himself with Rosenfeld, so did Salam; the Brazilian physicist was 

scientifically orphan. Attacking well known scientists from this condition is professional 

suicide. Furthermore, a central part of a physicist(cid:146)s training concerns developing social skills 

necessary to succeed in advancing his own arguments. This includes not only having access to 

gossips50, but also setting an appropriate tone during a controversy, recognizing the right 

moment to intervene, and, most importantly, choosing the allies and enemies. The study of 

Tausk(cid:146)s career is quite revealing of how scientists interact, how competing research programs 

interact, how political ideologies are coupled to scientific positions, and the difficulties of 

doing science in the periphery. Yet, it is perhaps even more revealing about the kind of tacit 

knowledge scientists learn during their training; young scientists can be wasted if they are not 

taught how to participate in controversies; this is an art that goes well beyond reason and 

logic. Tausk(cid:146)s case serves to show the consequences of trying to participate in controversies 

without the proper training and guidance. Third World as well as young scientists naively 

believe that this (cid:147)Machiavelism(cid:148) corrupts science, until they see how their advisors behave. 

 

21

Again, Tausk lacked the demonstration effect. Perhaps the history of science might be useful 

by showing young scientists to what extent science is a social practice. 

The phrase used by Salam30 (cid:150) (cid:147)consider this episode as part of the old battles(cid:148) (cid:150), to 

describe the incident involving Tausk(cid:146)s preprint, displays this social dimension of 

controversies, suggesting an analogy between controversies and military art. Just as in a war, 

controversies have winners and losers; one may also lose a battle but, in the long run, win the 

war. In the controversy of quantum theory, some were winners, like Niels Bohr, and some 

who lost battles, like David Bohm and the hidden variables program in the 50(cid:146)s, persevered 

and in the end won some battles or, at least, left their marks in the history of the controversy. 

But there are also losers who surrender in face of the austerity of the dispute: this seems to 

have been the case of Tausk. 

Appendix: Overview of Tausk(cid:146)s Arguments 

One may summarize Tausk(cid:146)s arguments against the theory of Daneri, Loinger and 

Prosperi (DLP) as follows. 

1) DLP only deal with the statistical case. Tausk presents an overview of the reduction 

(projection) postulate for an individual, (cid:147)pure(cid:148) case, and contrasts it with a statistical version, 

which he calls (cid:147)weak reduction postulate(cid:148). He then argues that what DLP derive in their paper 

is not the projection postulate in the pure case, but in the statistical case (Tausk, 1966, p. 4). If 

this is so, then the (cid:147)measurement problem(cid:148) is not solved, and DLP fail. This argument was 

accepted by Bohm, in his letter to Tausk, and was developed by Bub.51  

 

 

 

 

22

2) DLP(cid:146)s analysis is circular. Tausk argues that DLP(cid:146)s description of measurement in 

two stages is circular. This argument, however, seems to be due to an incorrect reading of 

DLP(cid:146)s theory. Jauch includes this argument in the (cid:147)many details with which I disagree(cid:148).52 

3) The ergodic hypothesis plays no role in DLP(cid:146)s theory. Tausk suggests that the use 

of the ergodic hypothesis in DLP(cid:146)s theory plays only a (cid:147)purely psychological role(cid:148).53 This view, 

however, is based on some sort of misunderstanding by Tausk. 

4) Null-result measurements refute DLP. This argument has been examined in section 

2. The argument is correct in showing that amplification is not necessary for state reduction. 

However, contrary to what one could expect, as we have mentioned before, the existence of 

null-result measurements does not refute DLP(cid:146)s theory, which makes no explicit mention of 

amplification, as argued by Loinger. After presenting his argument, Tausk gives an example 

of his not very elegant style, which contributed to the negative reception of his paper: (cid:147)To our 

mind, this argument shows that all attempts to fulfil [sic] the program of DLPI belong to the realm of 

wishful thinking or, occasionally, of just wishing(cid:148).54  

A few other points are made in his 1966 preprint and also in his 1967 doctoral thesis. 

5) Paradox of conservation of momentum. In section 5 of his preprint and in his 

thesis55, an apparent paradox is raised concerning the angular momentum of an atom that 

passes through a Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Assuming that before detection its angular 

momentum component is zero along the line joining the two magnets, right after detection 

one may ascribe to it a non-zero angular momentum component, either (cid:147)up(cid:148) or (cid:147)down(cid:148), 

depending on which of the two detectors triggered. How is this apparent violation of 

conservation of angular momentum to be explained?  A few years later, however, Tausk 

realized17 that this could be explained assuming a transfer of angular momentum to the Stern-

Gerlach magnets, located at a distance. 

 

23

6) Critique of Heisenberg(cid:146)s epistemic conception of reduction. In his famous book, 

Physics and Philosophy, Heisenberg claimed that state reduction expresses nothing more than 

an increase of our knowledge concerning a quantum mechanical system. Tausk criticizes such 

a view, and suggests that quantum mechanics requires a completely new foundation.56 

7) No-signalling theorem.  In his unpublished doctoral thesis, Tausk proved that an 

ensemble of correlated particles, I and II, prepared in the same composite state, can never be 

used to transmit information at a speed faster than that of light. This is probably the first time 

that a physicist cared to prove this result, which is actually very simple. In the literature, such 

a no-signalling theorem is attributed to Philippe Eberhard.57  

It is curious that in the continuation of the text, Tausk analyzes the famous paper by 

Einstein, Podolsky & Rosen (1935), and considers that they do not make use of the reduction 

postulate. This is incorrect, since they do make explicit use of it. This illustrates some of the 

shortcomings of Tausk(cid:146)s work, and the fact that it was maintained in the thesis even after the 

public defense shows that the Brazilian community of physicists was still not well prepared to 

understand and discuss the subtleties of the philosophical discussions in the foundations of 

quantum mechanics.

Bub (ref. 39) and an invitation letter from Vigier. His plan was to study elementary particles within the 

approach developed at the time by Vigier; specifically, to (cid:147)analyze the possibility of unifying the 

external dynamical symmetry of Elementary Particles with its internal symmetry, by introducing the De 

Sitter space(cid:148). The request had a favorable reference from JosØ Goldenberg, with a positive commentary 

to the work done in Trieste: (cid:147)This work of his on the measurement theory in quantum mechanics 

attracted considerable interest and, because of it, he was invited by Prof. Vigier for a period of work in

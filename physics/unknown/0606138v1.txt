In  this  paper  the  mass  of  a  universe,  which  began  as  a  gravitationally  closed,  maximally  spinning,  Planck 
density quantum string is derived. A universe beginning in such an initial state has been called a Super Spin Model 
universe.   

The  total  mass,  M,  of  the  Super  Spin  Model  universe  is  shown  to  be  a  function  of  only  four  fundamental 

parameters -, c, G, e, such that: M = 02(-c/G)1/2exp(-c/e2). 

The present paper primarily consists of a brief derivation of the above equation and a short synopsis of the Super

Introduction 
 

This is a brief review of the Super Spin Model, wherein the relationship: 
M = 402(8c/G)1/2exp(8c/e2)

was  established  for  a  non-stationary  axi-symmetric  space-time,  where  Mc2 is  the  space-time’s  total 
conserved energy.1

The present paper primarily consists of a brief derivation of the above equation and a short synopsis 

of the Super Spin Model (SSM). 

1092 gm·c2/cm3.

At some point near the beginning, the universe apparently was in a super dense energy state of about 

Other than introducing the somewhat ad-hoc mechanism of inflation, how could the nascent universe 
expand  and  overcome  the  intense  gravitational  fields  that  normally  would  reduce  it  to  a  state  of 
permanent and complete gravitational collapse?   

According to the SSM, the reason the universe expands is due to its initial rotating toroidal string-
like structure - its topology.  If the energy were distributed in the form of a maximally rotating Planck 
density string, then because of the initial balance of the centrifugal and gravitational forces, and due to 
its small surface area, the string would begin to evaporate into its “ergosphere” and in spite of its huge 
density would naturally begin to expand into its other, initially “compressed,” dimensions.  Such a string 
would already have been “pre-inflated” in one spatial dimension, while “compressed” in the others. 

To  reiterate,  the  SSM  universe  is  postulated  to  have  begun  as  a  gravitationally  closed,  maximally 
rotating  Planck  density  geon,  i.e.  a  four-dimensional  closed  string  with  three  of  its  four  dimensions 
“curled up” or compacted within contiguous Planck areas of their locally mutually orthogonal surfaces.  
Such a geon,2 with mass M and angular momentum magnitude J, has certain aspects that resemble the 

 
1 Three  additional  independent  equations  for  the  mass  ‘M’  of  such non-stationary  axi-symmetric  space-times  were  also  derived 
that led to linkages amongst: Newton’s universal gravitational constant ‘G’, the fundamental quantum of electric charge ‘e’, the 
fundamental quantum of angular momentum – Planck’s constant ‘-’, the speed of light ‘c’ in vacuo and the electron and proton 
masses,  me and  mp. This  set  of  connections,  in  turn,  led  to  linkages  among  the  four  fundamental  forces:  the  Gravitational, 
Electromagnetic, Strong, and Weak.  These linkages are discussed in Meyer (1995).    
 
2 Geons are gravitational electromagnetic entities.  They are regions consisting of electromagnetic radiation, which have sufficient 
energy density to become gravitationally confined.  That is, light itself forms a sort of black hole.  Wheeler developed this concept 
in 1954.

ring singularity of an extreme Kerr black hole.  One may visualize this beginning state as a circle of light 
– a geonic  pseudo  ring  singularity  –  a  closed  string  of  maximum  energy  density  light  consisting  of 
Planck mass photons – “primatons.”  See [Wheeler (1955)] and [Meyer (1980)]. 

The SSM is partially inspired by the Kerr family [Kerr (1963)] of stationary solutions for the empty 
space,  axi-symmetric,  Einstein-Maxwell,  source  free  equations.    However,  an  expanded  Bekenstein-
Hawking  thermodynamics  is  used  which  incorporates  both  the  inner  and  outer  event  horizon  areas  as 
measures of entropy, thereby yielding complete consistency with the Third Law of Thermodynamics.3

By employing  a continuous  variation of parameters  methodology along  with a parsimonious set of 
initial  boundary constraints, the stationary  metric is extended to a non-stationary axi-symmetric space-
time possessing non-stationary “evolving” event horizons. 

Due to their parametric simplicity, the uncharged Kerr family provides a rich laboratory in which to 
perform “gedanken versuchen.”  This uncharged family is determined by just two parameters: E and J,
where E=Mc2 is the total energy of the space-time and J is its total angular momentum.  This family is 
represented by the following metric: 

 

Where: 

ds2 = (2Rg r (cid:2) (cid:3)2)du2/(cid:3)2 (cid:2) 2aRz
+ 2dudr (cid:2) 2asin2

(cid:7),

J M |J|M aMc M Scalar value of space-time’s angular momentum, 

And: 

such that: 

  -R S r S +R,
-R S u S +R,
0 S (cid:8) S 2(cid:14),
0 S (cid:7) S (cid:14).

Note, there exist two non-negative event horizon radii, r+ and r(cid:2), which are the conjugate solutions of the 
equation: (cid:13)
They can be re-written as: 

2(r) = 0, which are: r± = Rg ± [Rg

2 – a2]1/2.

r± = Rg[1 + sin(± (cid:17))] (cid:18)
a2 = r+r(cid:2) = Rg

2cos2((cid:17)) and  r++ r(cid:2) = 2Rg.
Hence, the space-time’s specific angular momentum radius, ‘a’ is parameterized in terms of M and ±(cid:17),
so that:

a = a(±(cid:17)) = Rg cos((cid:17)) = GMcos((cid:17))/c2.

The angle ‘(cid:17)’ is therefore a measure of the magnitude of the space-time’s angular momentum (and/or 
expansion state).  That is: 

 

J(M, ± (cid:17)) = a(±(cid:17))Mc = RgMccos((cid:17)) = GM2cos((cid:17))/c = | J(M, ± (cid:17))|. 
As  is  easily  seen,  (cid:17) = ±0 implies  a  maximally  rotating  Kerr  space-time  and  (cid:17) = ± (cid:14)/2 implies  a  static 
Schwarzschild space-time. 
 

3 It can be readily shown that the Third Law of Thermodynamics is satisfied if the area of the inner event horizon of a Kerr black 
hole is treated as a measure of the hole’s negative entropy and, as usual, the outer event horizon area is treated as a measure of its 
positive entropy.

The Description of the SSM Universe (U) as a Rotating Non-Stationary Axi-Symmetric Space-Time 

 
One way to produce a model of a non-stationary axi-symmetric space-time, is to characterize the 

entire family of stationary uncharged Kerr solutions as the set of ordered pairs:  

{< (cid:21), J>} = {< (cid:21), J(± (cid:17)) > (cid:23) [(cid:2)(cid:14)/2 (cid:25) (cid:17) (cid:25) (cid:14)/2]}. 
 

Such a  parameterization  gives the entire  family of  Kerr solutions in  terms of only two  parameters 
‘M’  and  ‘(cid:17)’ and  only  two  universal  constants  ‘G’  and  ‘c.’  That  is  any  member  of  the  Kerr  metric 
familycan be represented as the ordered pair: < M, J((cid:17)) > = < M, GM2cos((cid:17))/c >.

By treating ±(cid:17) as a dual-time dependent variable, it is possible to transform the Kerr metric for the 
stationary  family, wherein  each  member  contains  a  pair  of  completed  inner  and  outer  event  horizons, 
into a single dual-valued time-varying metric. In other words, the family of metrics is transformed into a 
single  metric  function  of  (cid:17), which  governs  the  evolution  of  the  non-stationary  incomplete  inner  and 
outer  event  horizons,  H(r±((cid:17)),(cid:7)±((cid:17))),  that  emanate  from  the  “creation  ring”  and  grow  in  both 
±(cid:17) directions, starting from (cid:17) = 0, where: r±(±0) = Rg and  (cid:7)±(±0)= (cid:14)/2.  The expansion trajectories of 
the event horizons’ altitudinal “rims” are governed by: (cid:7)±((cid:17)) = (cid:14)/2 ± |(cid:17)|. 

For the stationary metric, when (cid:13)

2 – a2]1/2, then ds±=0.  However, this is not 
generally true when the metric coefficients are written as a function of the parameter (cid:17). That is, ds±/d(cid:17)
is generally W 0, for the hypersurfaces, (cid:13)

2(r±) = 0, when ±(cid:17) is a dual-time dependent variable. 

2(r) = 0 (cid:18) r± = Rg ± [Rg

Rewriting the metric in terms of its past directed and future directed non-stationary event horizons,4

we get: 

 
2 = (cid:3)±

 

ds±

2d(cid:7)2 (cid:2) 2asin2(cid:7)dr±d(cid:8) + 2dr±du± + sin2(cid:7)[Rz±

Where the boundary conditions of ‘U’ are: 
0 S r(cid:2) S Rg S r+ S 2Rg,
0 S (cid:7)(cid:2) M (cid:14)/2 (cid:2) |(cid:17)| S (cid:7) S (cid:14)/2 + |(cid:17)| M (cid:7)+,
0 S (cid:8) S 2(cid:14),
(cid:2)R S u S +R.

And: r± = Rg[1+ sin(±(cid:17))] are the event horizon radii,
2 + a2cos2(cid:7) are the rotation-offset radii, 

2 = r±

(cid:3)±
Rz±((cid:17)) = [2Rgr±]1/2 = [r±
and 
(cid:31)±((cid:17)) = c d(cid:8)/du± = -gu(cid:8)((cid:17))c/g(cid:8)(cid:8)((cid:17)) = ac/(Rz±)2 = c cos(cid:17)/[2Rg(1± sin(cid:17))]  
horizon rotation rates. 

2 + a2]1/2 = Rg[2(1 ± sin(cid:17))]1/2 are the radii of gyration of the event horizons, 

are  the  dual  event 

For a constant M, one can see that the moments of inertia are: I± = M Rz±
2,
since: I±(cid:31)± = J(±(cid:17)) = a(±(cid:17))Mc = RgMc cos((cid:17)) = GM2cos((cid:17))/c = |J(±(cid:17))|. 
 

The above formulations are applicable to the subset U of the axi-symmetric space-time manifold,5 M,
such  that  U is  isomorphic  to  the  intrinsically  non-stationary  region,  which  is  partially  bounded  by  or 
swept out by the two “incomplete” event horizons  with radii: r± = r((cid:17)(t±)).  Notice at (cid:17) = ±(cid:14)/2,  the U
becomes identical to a Schwarzschild black hole with complete and stationary event horizons.  It is also 
critical to notice, that for constant (cid:17) (the stationary case), the r± are the loci of null hyper-surfaces, but 
for variable (cid:17) (the non-stationary case) the r± loci are null only where: 

 

 

cos2(cid:7) = sin2(cid:17) (cid:18) (cid:7) = (cid:7)± M (cid:14)/2 ± (cid:17).

The inner and outer event horizon areas are calculated by: 
((cid:14)/2+ (cid:17)) 2(cid:14)

A(±(cid:17)) = X((cid:14)/2(cid:2)(cid:17)) X0Y(g(cid:8)(cid:8) g(cid:7)(cid:7) ) d(cid:8)d(cid:7) = 4(cid:14)Rz±

2sin(±(cid:17)) =

8(cid:14)Rg

2sin(±(cid:17))[1+ sin(±(cid:17))]. 

 
4 See Meyer (1995) 
5 There might also exist an independent anti M 5 - M, simultaneously created with equal energy and angular momentum, but with 
opposite parity.

Therefore, the total net horizon area6 for the SSM Universe is reckoned as: 
(2) ((cid:17)) = A(+(cid:17)) + A(-(cid:17)) = 16(cid:14)(Rg sin(cid:17))2.

AU

 

Moreover, the spatial volume7 or hyper-surface area of the SSM U is calculated as: 

AU

(3)((cid:17)) = 4(cid:14)Rg

3sin(cid:17)(5(cid:17) (cid:2) 3sin(cid:17)cos(cid:17)) M VU((cid:17)). 

We also find that the space-time 4-volume, (ignoring the Y-1 coefficient) is: 

AU

(4)((cid:17)) = (8(cid:14)c/3) ts((cid:17))Rg

3 sin2(cid:17) (3 + 2 sin2(cid:17) (cid:2) sin4(cid:17)). 

Of course, the circumference C(cid:13)± is the one-dimensional “area”:  

AU

(1)((cid:17)) = 4(cid:14)Rg.

 

A net  time  interval,8 ts((cid:17)),  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  future  directed,  u+((cid:17))/c,  and  past-
directed, u(cid:2)((cid:17))/c, geodesic time displacements, is reckoned by: 
cts((cid:17)) M [u+((cid:17)) (cid:2) u(cid:2)((cid:17))] = Rg [-ln(1 (cid:2) sin|(cid:17)|) (cid:2) ln(1 + sin|(cid:17)|)] = -Rg ln(1(cid:2) sin2(cid:17)). 
 
In general:  cts(±(cid:17)) = -Rgln(cos2

(cid:17)).  Note that at maximum expansion, when (cid:17)=±(cid:14)/2, then:  

cts(±(cid:14)/2) = (cid:2)Rgln[1(cid:2) sin2(±(cid:14)/2)] = +R.

Observe that the past-directed9 time displacement: t(cid:2)((cid:17)) = Rg ln(1 + sin |(cid:17)|)/c, is always finite. 

The  expansion  parameter  ‘(cid:17)’ grows  in  both  directions  away  from  an  origin  (cid:17) # ±0.   That  is,  the 
space-time expands both ways in time.10  In the beginning, the space-time or “creation ring” is a closed 
cosmic  string  with  an  inflated  circumference.    Since  J, the  angular  momentum  vector,  is  a  cosine 
function  of  (cid:17), then  by  increasing  |(cid:17)|, the  angular  momentum  magnitude  is  decreased  and  the  space 
expands.  As (cid:17) approaches ±(cid:14)/2, the outer event horizon approaches the Schwarzschild radius and the 
inner event horizon radius approaches zero. 

 
See Figs. 1, 2 and 3, which are schematics that attempt to depict how the SSM universe evolves.

The Initial Conditions 
 
Let  (cid:17)$ % ±0 be  the  values  of  (cid:17) when  the  density  of  the  toroidal  geonic  string  universe  is  equal  to  the 
Planck photon density.11  This occurs when: 
3(cid:17)$

2 = ]& = c5 / 8(cid:14)2G2-

 

] M M / VU((cid:17)$) = M / 4(cid:14)Rg
(cid:18) (cid:17)$ = ±(cid:5)(cid:14) /N&.

 

Therefore, for the small angle at creation (cid:17) = (cid:17)$ one gets: 
2 = (cid:14)Rg / N&
which is one half  12 the Compton  wavelength of the SSM universe.   Note for a universe  of  mass M ~ 
1056gm, the Compton time, or creation interval t$ is about 10-104

cts((cid:17)$) = (cid:2)Rg ln(1(cid:2) sin2

2 = (cid:14)-/Mc M ct$,

(cid:17)$) % Rg(cid:17)$

 sec.  

 
6 Note that at (cid:17) = 0, the net event horizon area is zero, which of course means that the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is also zero. 
7 This spatial volume calculation is worked out in Meyer (1995). 
8 Meyer (1995), (2000) 
9 Whereas, the maximum past time is always finite, the maximum future time is always infinite.  
10 Notice that both directions and senses of the temporal dimension, i.e. time and anti-time began (were created) at (cid:17) = 0, along 
with  the  other  spatial  dimensions.    It  is  simple  but  interesting  to  observe  that  anti-time  trajectories  cannot  reach  the  “terra 
incognita” beyond or before the universe was created. 
11  In this paper, the Greek letter varpi ‘&’ denotes a Planckian parameter, so that the Planck mass is: m& = (-c/G)1/2, the Planck 
momentum magnitude is: p& = m&c, the Planck radius is: r& = -/p&, the Planck wavelength is: ’& = 2(cid:14)r&, the Planck time is: t& =
’&/c and so forth. 
12  This might mean there were two universes created as a quantum fluctuation of the vacuum.  That is, there might be another U
created with opposite parity, so that the net angular momentum would be zero.  In this paper, we shall just be concerned with one 
of them.

Nevertheless,  immediately  after  the  instant  of  creation  at  t$ ~10-104

  sec,  the  U’s  minimum  spatial 
dimension is already on the order of the Planck length.  It therefore follows that the lowest bound of any 
future temporal increment must be on the order of the Planck time. 

If the  universe started as a non-rotating bubble  membrane fluctuation, then because of the extreme 
“thinness” of the membrane, there is no apparent reason that such a non-rotating bubble would be stable.  
It should “flash back” into the vacuum from whence it sprang within its Compton time,13 tc = 2(cid:14)-/Mc2.

However,  in  the  SSM,  the  angular  momentum  of  the  maximally  spinning  string  induces  a  coarser 
granularity by a factor of N& upon both the spatial and temporal quanta of the fluctuation’s active region.  
That is, the previously indivisible quanta become Planck sized.   

Thus,  the  angular  momentum  of  the  creative  process  produces  a  real  space-time,  “inflating,”  by  a 
factor of N&, the universe’s original indivisible spatial and temporal quanta, i.e., its Compton length and 
time, to the Planck length and time, (r& and t&), which become its new indivisible spatial and temporal 
quanta. 

The rotating string topology thereby produces a “one-way valve” which “closes all the hatches” and 
stops the  massive virtual fluctuation from  “sinking” back into the vacuum within ~10-104 sec.  In other 
words, the Creator “writes a check” to the vacuum for about 1056 grams of energy and then “changes the 
banking rules before it can clear.”   

 

At creation, when (cid:17) = (cid:17)$ = ±Y(cid:14) /N&:
( a gravitationally closed, Planck density string of length14 M C(cid:13)± = 4(cid:14)Rg.

( maximum vacuum polarization16 energy = )evac& = e2(c3/-G)1/2 = kTevac&.
( maximum photon energy = )(cid:13)& = (-c5/G)1/2 M m&c2.

Derivation of the String’s Mass 

Along the string's ergosphere, the Unruh temperature [Unruh (1976)] is reckoned as: 
Tevac& = -*evac& /2(cid:14)ck, where: *evac& = 2(cid:14)‘2r/‘t2|& = e2c/r&- and r&= ’&/2(cid:14).
And when |(cid:17)| S |(cid:17)$|, then: r±((cid:17)) = Rg ± +r % Rg and (cid:7)±((cid:17)) = (cid:14)/2 ± +(cid:7) % (cid:14)/2. 

 

In  other  words,  a  main  postulate  is  that  the  initial  fluctuation  is  a  non-singular  coherent  toroidal 
electromagnetic  disturbance  of  Planck  density,  ]&. This  fluctuation  is  formally  identical  to  a  toroidal 
geon,  or  a  closed  circular  string  of  mass  N& in  Planck  units,  with  total  initial  angular  momentum 
magnitude: 

 J(0) = [J(0)(cid:127)J(0)] 1/2 = -[N&
where: N& M M/m&.

After a little algebra, one finds that the initial volume of the six dimensional phase space occupied by the 
string-like universe at (cid:17)$ is:

However,  the  total  phase  space  volume  at  ±(cid:17)$ is  the  sum  of  the  volumes  of  all  cubic  action 
compartments -3. This volume is calculated as:

space  orthogonal  to  the  axis  of  symmetry,  J(0),  i.e.  (cid:7) = (cid:14)/2.)    Note,  the  circumference  is  constant  for  all  (cid:17) and  hence,  is 
independent of the event horizon radii.

(6)((cid:17)$) = [(Jx((cid:17)$) ± =) x (Jy((cid:17)$) ± =)](cid:127)(Jz((cid:17)$) ± =).  

Now, since the metric is axi-symmetric, we can choose: Jx((cid:17)$) = Jy((cid:17)$) = 0 and |Jz((cid:17)$)| = RgMc.  It then 
2 -3 ± O(-3). Moreover, the ratio of the string’s initial sub-
follows that: VS

That is: <n&> = V0

2/[exp()(cid:13)& /kTevac&) (cid:2)1] = 2/[exp()(cid:13)&/kTevac&) (cid:2)1)] = 2/[exp(-c/e2) (cid:2)1)]. 

Since, -c/e2=.(cid:2)1

% 137, we obviously can neglect the ‘-1’ term and therefore get: 

N& = 4(cid:14)2exp(-c/e2) = 4(cid:14)2 exp(1/.) = M/m&.
Therefore, the mass, M, of this rotating string universe is reckoned as: 

M = 402(8c/G)1/2exp(8c/e2) = 2.8062 x 1056 gm. 

Entropy Formulation 

It has been  found that the thermodynamics of stationary black holes becomes consistent  with classical 
thermodynamics  by  introducing  an  extended  interpretation  of  the  "Bekenstein-Hawking"17,  18  entropy 
formula, by augmenting it to include the inner event horizon area as a measure of “negentropy.” 19 

By  also  extending  this  augmentation  to  the  incomplete  and  evolving  event  horizons  of  the  non-

stationary SSM U, the net entropy of U as a function of (cid:17) then becomes:  

S(±(cid:17)) = 4(cid:14)k(N& sin(cid:17))2

1 0, -(cid:17).

It  is  easy  to  see  that  entropy  will  increase  along  both  positive  and  negative  temporal  directions  as 

both temporal displacements increase away from the origin in both positive and negative time.   

There is a low initial entropy value upon the creation of the Planck density string20 at (cid:17) = (cid:17)$. This 

value is:  

S((cid:17)$) = 4(cid:14)k(N& sin (cid:17)$)2 = 4(cid:14)2k,  

where (cid:17)$ = ±2(cid:14)/3& and ‘k’ is Boltzman's constant. 

 

Since  cts(±(cid:17)) = (cid:2)Rgln(1(cid:2) sin2

the  U approaches  its 
Schwarzschild limit, and the net event horizon area and net entropy approach their maxima.21 From the 
above equation for S(±(cid:17)) the maximum entropy is therefore: 

(cid:17)$), then  as  (cid:17) 4 ±(cid:14)/2, and  ts 4 R,

S(±(cid:14)/2) = 4(cid:14)kN&

2 = 64(cid:14)5 k exp(2/.) = 1.51287 x 10139 (erg/ºK).

for  stationary  Kerr  black  holes  are  reckoned  by: 
*±=±c2(Rg
2(cid:2) (J/Mc)2)1/2] = 0.  When Rg = J/Mc, both event horizon temperatures are calculated as: T±=
8*± /20kc = 0.  However, the un-augmented Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is: SBH = 20kGM2/8c >> 0, which leads to a violation of 
the Third Law. 
20 In the SSM, since the space-time is non-stationary and its string-like initial state is far from equilibrium, the initial net entropy is 
near zero, whereas its initial temperature is very large. 
21 The excess angular momentum energy, 67J = Mc2[1-1/Y2], that is not taken up by the expansion, see Christodoulu (1970), is 
conjectured to be taken up by the generation of “flywheels” surmised to be a species of neutrinos, see Meyer (1995).  Some of the 
excess may also be stored in the rotational energy of galaxies, stars and other spinning and rotating objects.

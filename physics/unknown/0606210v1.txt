Abstract 

We report on recent measurements with Thick GEM-like (THGEM) – based imaging detectors. The THGEM is a 
robust gaseous electron multiplier similar to GEM but with larger dimensions.  It has high electron multiplication, 
of  105  and  107  in  single-  and  double-THGEM  structure,  respectively,  fast  signals  and  ~10MHz/mm2  rate-
capability.  It  can  be  produced  in  any  shape  and  over  large  area.  In  view  of  many  possible  applications  of 
THGEM-based  imaging  detectors,  in  particle  physics  and  beyond,  we  have  recently  studied  the  localization 
properties of a 2D 10x10 cm2 detector; the results are shortly presented.

1. Introduction  

The thick GEM (THGEM) [1] is an "expanded" GEM, economically produced in the PCB industry by simple 
drilling  and  etching  in  G-10  or  other  insulating  materials  (fig.  1).  Similar  to  GEM,  its  operation  is  based  on 
electron  gas  avalanche  multiplication  in  sub-mm  holes,  resulting  in  very  high  gain  and  fast  signals.  Due  to  its 
large hole size, the THGEM is particularly efficient in transporting the electrons into and from the holes, leading 
to efficient single-electron detection and effective cascaded operation.  

The THGEM provides true pixilated radiation localization, ns signals, high gain and high rate capability. For a 
comprehensive summary of the THGEM properties, the reader is referred to [2, 3]. In this article we present a 
summary of our recent study on THGEM-based imaging, carried out with a 10x10 cm2 double-THGEM detector. 

2. The 10x10 cm2 imaging detector 

The  detector  was  made  of  two  THGEMs  (10x10  cm2)  in  cascade,  coupled  to  a  resistive  anode  made  of  2 
MΩ/□ graphite on G10 substrate. Behind the resistive anode the broadened induced signals were captured on a 
double-sided X-Y readout electrode, structured with pad strings with a pitch of 2 mm and equipped with discrete 
delay-line  circuits  for  each  coordinate.  The  detector  was  operated  in  atmospheric  Ar/CH4  (95:5)  and  its

performance was studied with 6-8 keV X-rays. The detector yielded ~20% FWHM local energy resolution and 
gain uniformity of ±10% FWHM over the whole surface.  

The imaging resolutions were studied with a steel mask, having slits series of frequencies 0.05 to 1 line-pairs 
per  mm.  The  contrast  transfer  function,  CTF,  was  calculated  from  the  recorded  image  (fig.  3).  The  spatial 
resolution  is  better  then  0.4  mm  FWHM,  in  spite  of  the  1mm  hole  pitch;  it  has  good  linearity  and  good 
homogeneity. Furthermore, the image has very low digital noise, of the order of ~3 % standard deviation across 
the sensitive area.   

THGEM-based detectors could become an attractive robust and economic solution for numerous applications 
requiring  large-area  detectors  with  sub-mm  localization  resolution.    Examples  are:  elements  for  large  TPC 
readout,  sampling  elements  in  Calorimetry  (e.g.  for  ILC),  UV-photon  imaging  in  RICH  [4],  LXe  scintillations 
recording,  moderate-resolution  tracking  (LHC2),  x-ray  and  neutron  imaging,  etc.  Of  particular  interest  is  the 
detection  of  UV  photons  in  RICH  systems,  presently  performed  with  GEM,  with  the  possibility  to  deposit  the 
photocathode on the THGEM's top face and operate it in a mode insensitive to the ionizing hadronic background 
[4].

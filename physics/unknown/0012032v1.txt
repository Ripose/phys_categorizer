In this paper we present a theoretical analysis of an experiment by Mugnai and collaborators where 
superluminal behavior was observed in the propagation of microwaves. We suggest that what was 
observed  can  be  well  approximated  by  the  motion  of  a  superluminal  X  wave.  Furthermore  the 
experimental  results  are  also  explained  by  the  so  called  scissor  effect  which  occurs  with  the 
convergence of pairs of signals coming from opposite points of an annular region of the mirror and 
forming  an  interference  peak  on  the  intersection  axis  traveling  at  superluminal  speed.  We  clarify 
some misunderstandings concerning this kind of electromagnetic wave propagation in vacuum.

In this note we make some comments on a 
recent  letter  by  Mugnai,  Ranfagni  and Ruggieri 
[1]  claiming  the  observation  of  superluminal 
behavior  in  microwave  propagation  for  long 
distances in air. Our comments are of theoretical 
nature  and  about  possible  explanations  for  the 
measured effect. 

From  the  theoretical  point  of  view,  we 
the  following  statement 
start  by  analyzing 
quoted in [1] and attributed to [2]: (cid:147)Yet, there is 
no  formal  proof,  based  on  Maxwell  equations 
ME  that  no  electromagnetic  wave  packet  can 
travel faster than the speed of light.(cid:148) First of all 
we  note  that  every  physical  wave  (satisfying 
ME)  produced  by  a  physical  device  (antenna) 
must  necessarily  have  a  beginning  and 
(possibly) an end in time. If this is the case, we 
say  that  the  electromagnetic  field  configuration 
produced  when  ready  has  compact  support  in 
the time domain. Such a configuration is called 
electromagnetic  pulse.  Observe  also  that  if  the 
pulse  generated  by  the  device  does  not  spread 
with an infinity speed, then when it is ready, let 
 it must occupy a finite region in 
us say at 
space. In an appropriate reference frame, we can

system  of  partial  differential  equations  [3]. 
Moreover,  each  one  of  the  components  of  the 
a 
free 
homogeneous  wave  equation  (HWE).  It  is  then 
possible to prove under very general conditions 
(strictly  hyperbolic  Cauchy  problem)  that,  if  an 
electromagnetic pulse has field components and 
first  time  derivatives  with  compact  support  in 
, then the time evolution of such 
space at  
field  components  must  be  null 
for

.  As  usual  c  is  the  parameter  that 
appears  in  the    HWE  satisfied  by  any  of  the 
components  of  the  electromagnetic  field.  This 
result  can  be  called  finite  propagation  speed 
theorem  FSPT.  We  emphasize  here  that  the 
FSPT implies that the front of the pulse travels 
with  maximum  speed    c  (in  some  cases  we  can 
prove  that  it  indeed  travels with speed  c) but it 
does  not  fix  any  minimum  speed  for  the  lateral 
boundary  of  the  signal  spread.  This  is  a  very 
important  result  since  it  enables  the  project  of 
antennas  for  sending  well  focused  waves. 
However,  it  is  important  to  stress  that  perfect

focusing  is  impossible  for  any  finite  energy 
solution  of  ME  [5].  Note  also,  that  it  is  not 
possible to prove an analogous of the FSPT for 
waves  that  do  not  have  compact  support  in  the 
space domain (or in time domain).

presented  above,  although  of 
character, are not well known as they should be. 
We  now  state  a  result  that  at  first  sight 

∞<≤ v

seems to contradict what has been 
said  above,  that  is:  ME  (and  also  all  the  other 
relativistic  wave  equations)  possess 
linear

)  that  are

undistorted  progressive  waves  (UPWs)  even  in 
free  space  (for  a  review, see  [16]  and also [18-
19]).  These  UPWs  solutions,  like  plane  wave 
solutions  of  ME,  have  infinite  energy,  and 
classical  electromagnetic  theory  implies  that 
they  are  only  convenient  approximations  to 
what  can  be  really  built  in  the  physical  world. 
There  exists  therefore  a  crucial  distinction 
between solutions of ME and physical realizable 
solutions of that equations. Once an exact UPW 
solution is known, it is possible to launch pulses 
that are finite aperture approximations (FAA) to 
that UPW, i.e., pulses obtained through the well 
known  Rayleigh-Sommerfeld  approximation 
[20].  As  already  stated,  there  are  subluminal, 
luminal  and  superluminal  UPWs.  A  FAA  to  a

subluminal  (superluminal)  group  velocity.  This

was  predicted  that  the  phenomenon  could  be 
observed  for  electromagnetic  superluminal  X 
waves  (SEXWs).  In  fact  Saari  and  Reivelt 
produced a FAA to a SEXW pulse in the optical 
range [21].

For  clarity  we  emphasize  that  all  of  the

exact  superluminal  UPWs  have  shown  that  the 
v ≥   in  some  particular 
peak  indeed  travels  at 
circumstances  ( c   is  the  medium  characteristic

travels  at  c)  is  reached  by  the  peak  after  some

showed  long  ago  (see  [6])  that  electromagnetic 
pulses  travel  with  front  velocity  c  even  in 
dispersive media. In fact they concluded that the 
concept of group velocity can not be applied to 
superluminal  wave  motion  and  this  statement 
has been repeated in many textbooks since then, 
as,  e.g.,  in  [7,8].  However,  their  conclusion  is 
misleading  since  it  is  now  well  known  that 
superluminal  groups  velocities  can  be  observed 
(see, e.g.[9-11]). Even negative group velocities 
have been observed [12,13]. The explanation for

are  some  claims  that  this  is  not  the  case  [17]. 
in  favor  of  genuine 
The  basic  argument 
superluminality, [17], is that a real wave packet 
must  have  compact  support  in  the  frequency 
domain  because:  (cid:147)...signals  with  an  infinite 
spectrum  are  impossible,  since  Planck  has 
shown  in  1900  that  the  minimum  energy  of  a 
frequency  component  is  ω(cid:1)   .(cid:148)  Lack  of  space 
prevent  us  from  discussing  this  argument  here. 
Instead we recall that Fourier theory implies that 
a  signal  with  compact  support  in  the  frequency 
domain is unlimited in the time domain, i.e., has 
no fronts so that it is impossible to define a front 
velocity  for  it  and  only  the  group  velocity  has 
physical meaning. Following this reasoning, we 
cannot endorse the point of view of [17] which 
seems  also  the  one  adopted  in  [1],  simply 
because it implies the existence of wave packets

necessary 
preliminaries,  we  can  now  present  specific 
criticisms  to the  contents  of [1]. Recall  that we 
can  generate  solutions  of    ME  with  the  Hertz 
potential method [7,16]. The Hertz potential for 
a  free  ME  solves  a  HWE.  If  we  take  the  form 
used  in  [18]  ,  e.g.,  a  magnetic  Hertz  potential 
(cid:136)Φ=Π
  in  a  fixed  direction,  say  the  z-

In Eq.(1) 
and  Ω   is  a  separation  constant  (see,  e.g.,  [18] 
for  details).  The  second  equation  above 
establishes  the  dispersion  relation.  However,  in 
this case the electric component of the Maxwell 
field  cannot  have  the  same  form  as  the  Hertz 
potential in Eq.(1). As can be easily verified by 
direct  computation,  an  electric  Hertz  potential, 
 (see [7]) with  Φ  as in Eq.(1) naturally

of  the  experiment  in  [1]  that  reports  a  horn 
antenna emitting a TE wave. More importantly, 
the  Hertz  potential  in  (1)  and  its  associated 
electromagnetic  fields  are  not  superluminal. 
Only  the  phase  velocity  is  superluminal,  the 
group  velocity 
subluminal.  This

interpretation,  as  showed  in  [18]  is  indeed 
correct,  since  it  is  possible  to  find  a  Lorentz 
reference  frame  where  the solution represents a 
standing  wave.  Also, for  the  acoustical case, as 
reported  in  [18],  a  Bessel  beam,  i.e.,  a  FAA  to

accept  the  data  in  [1]  as  correct,  we  must 
conclude  that  no  FAA  to  an  electromagnetic 
Bessel beam was observed.

But  what  kind  of  wave  could  produce the 
[1]?  A 
superluminal  effect  described 
proposed  answer  is  a  particular  kind  of  SEXW 
(superluminal electromagnetic X-wave) pulse. X 
like  pulses  were  firstly  reported  by  Lu  and 
Greenleaf  in  the  acoustical  case  [22,23].  Their 
speeds  have  been  measured  in  an  experiment 
reported  in  [18],  where  also  the  mathematical 
theory  of  SEXWs  and  computer  simulations  for 
their behavior were presented. A straightforward 
solution can be generated through the following

a specific time to travel from the reflection point

However  the  experimental  results  in      [1]

we  do  agree  that  diffraction  effects  could  be

simulations  (based  on  finite  difference  method) 
of  wave  propagation  including  diffraction  of 
rays due to source shadowing. However, we can

observed  in  [1]  shows  a  varying  propagation 
 of the peak that cannot be explained 
speed 
solely  by  a  single  X  wave  (whose  superluminal 
speed  is  constant).  If  we  admit  however  a 
sequence  of  spherical  wave  points  emanating 
from  simultaneous  sources  (an  annular  region) 
on  the  mirror  and  interfering  on  the  z-axis,  the 
dependence  of  v   on  z  can  be  quantitatively 
explained.  This  is  indeed  the  base  of  the  so 
called  scissor  effect.  For  simplicity  we  admit  a 
(cid:147)virtual(cid:148) annular source with diameter a placed 
somewhere on a plane behind (or in front of) the 
mirror.  If  t  is  the  time  counted  since  the

Since the interference peak is on the z-axis, it is 
only  locally  similar  to  a  X-wave.  There  is  no 
simple relation between the axicon angle of the 
local X pulse - which changes along z - and the 
axicon angle used in [1] on the assumption that 
it was indeed a Bessel pulse (as imagined by the 
authors of [1]). A larger circular slit radius (for 
the real source on the mirror focal plane) simply 
implies a larger separation of the virtual sources

Numerical  simulations  are  shown  in  Figure  3

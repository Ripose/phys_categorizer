Abstract

and 

(LANL), 

The SNS is a spallation neutron research facility being
built at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee [1].
The Linac portion of the SNS (with the exception of the
superconducting cavities) is the responsibility of the Los
Alamos  National  Laboratory 
this
responsibility includes the RF system for the entire linac.
The linac accelerates an average beam current of 2 mA to
an energy of 968 MeV. The linac is pulsed at 60 Hz with
an H- beam pulse of 1 ms. The first 185 Mev of the linac
uses normal conducting cavities, and the remaining length
of the linac uses superconducting cavities [2]. The linac
operates at 402.5 MHz up to 87 MeV and then changes to
805 MHz for the remainder. This paper gives an overview
of  the  Linac  RF  system.  The  overview  includes  a
description  and  configuration  of  the  high  power  RF
components,  the  HV  converter/modulator,  and  the  RF
controls. Issues and tradeoffs in the RF system will be
discussed, especially with regards  to  the  use  of  pulsed
superconducting cavities.

1  OVERVIEW OF SNS LINAC

The SNS Linac is a nominal 968 MeV, 2 mA average,
H- accelerator (Figure 1). The system  provides  52  mA
peak at 1 ms pulse width and a 60 Hz repetition rate. The
beam is chopped  with  a  68%  chopping  factor,  for  an
average beam during the pulse of 36 mA. The accelerator
begins with an injector and RFQ (from Berkeley), then a
Drift Tube Linac (DTL)  to  86.8  MeV,  followed  by  a
Coupled-Cavity Linac (CCL) to 186 MeV. Los Alamos
is responsible for the DTL and CCL structures and all of
the  linac  RF  systems.  The  remaining  part  of 
the
accelerator uses superconducting cavities (from Jefferson
Laboratory),  using  ß=0.61  cavities  to  375  MeV,  then
ß=0.81 cavities to 968 MeV. The RFQ and DTL operate
at 402.5 MHz, and the CCL and superconducting cavities
operate at 805 MHz.

The different structures and frequencies require  that  3
different types of klystrons be used. The RFQ and DTL
will use 2.5 MW peak klystrons at 402.5 MHz. The CCL

will use 5 MW  peak  klystrons  at  805  MHz,  and  the
superconducting cavities will use 550  kW  klystrons  at
805 MHz. The types and quantities and applications are
listed in Table 1.

on the power  required  in  the  particular  portion  of  the

Figure 2: RF System block diagram for superconducting
cavities. For room temperature cavities, each klystron has

its own RF controls and Transmitter electronics.

In order to standardize as much as possible,  the  HV
systems are designed to provide power to klystrons  for
‘approximately’ 5 MW of RF. Therefore, the 402.5 MHz
klystrons  are  configured  with  2  klystrons  per  power
supply. The CCL uses one klystron per HV system, and

the superconducting klystrons are combined in groups of
11 or 12 per HV system (depending on the amount of
power needed for that portion of the linac). Transmitters
provide support electronics and interlocks to 2 klystrons
(402.5  MHz),  1  klystron 
(CCL),  or  6  klystrons
(superconducting systems). Each klystron along the entire
linac has its own feedback/feedforward RF control system.
The power required along the superconducting portion of
the linac is shown in Figure 3. Since the SNS is a proton
machine,  the  power  required  in  each  cavity  varies,
depending on the cavity ß and the velocity of the particles.
Since  one  HV  supply  provides  power  to  11  or  12
klystrons,  each  klystron  in  that  group  has  the  same
saturated  power  level,  set  by 
the  highest  power
requirement in the group.

The HV System provides everything  from  the  input
13.2 kVAC line to the klystron, including the electronics
to  provide  pulsed  HV  to  the  klystron  cathode.  Los
Alamos  is  developing  a  unique  design  that  provides
conversion of HV-AC to HV-DC  as  well  as  the  high
voltage pulse modulation needed for SNS [3]. The design
is very conservative with space and appears to be a very
cost-effective approach as well. A block diagram of the
converter-modulator is shown  in  Figure  4.  The  design
uses standard 60 Hz technology to convert the incoming
13.2 kVAC to 3 kVDC. It then uses IGBT’s, operating at
20 kHz switching speeds into a 3-phase inverter step-up
circuit and a high voltage rectifier/filter, to convert  the
low voltage DC into the required pulsed, high voltage DC
for the klystrons. The system is very versatile in that the
only  changes  needed  between  the  5  MW  klystron
application (135 kV, 70 A)  and  the  550  kW  klystron
application  (75  kV,  130  A)  are  the  turns-ratio  and
peaking-capacitor value in the 3-phase high voltage step-
up 
system  employs  pulse-width
modulation (PWM) of the IGBT switching to maintain
regulation. The control of this PWM as well as the SCR
phase  control  is  achieved  by  a  combination  of  both
feedback and feedforward.

Figure 5: RF Controls for SNS

The RF control  system  has  to  control  RF  systems
consisting of both room temperature and superconducting
cavities, frequencies of both  402.5  and  805  MHz,  and
klystrons of 2.5 MW, 5 MW, and 550 kW [4,5]. The
control  system 
is  based  on  the  controls  originally
developed for the Ground Test Accelerator at LANL, and
then recently adapted for the Accelerator for Production of
Tritium. The system is based on VXI hardware. A block
diagram of the control system is shown in Figure 5. The
original  GTA  system  did  all  of  the  actual  control
electronics in analog circuitry. For APT , the system used
a combination of digital (for low frequency control) and
analog (for higher speed control). Recent advances in the
speed of digital electronics has led us to pursue an all-
digital control system for use on SNS. In addition it will
make  extensive  use  digital  signal  processors  (DSP’s)
which will allow changes in the control algorithms by
reprogramming  the  DSP’s  rather  than  changing  the
hardware.

We  have  also  developed  an  extensive  model  of  the
control  system, 
things  as  klystron
saturation, 
loop  delay,  microphonics,  Lorentz-force
detuning,  and  beam  and  power  supply  noise  [6].  The
model has been developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK, and
allows  us 
the  design  approach  before
producing any hardware.  An  example  of  one  modeling
result is shown in Figure 6.

3  PULSED OPERATION OF A
SUPERCONDUCTING PROTON

ACCELERATOR

Until recently, superconducting cavities have been used
only 
in  CW  applications.  Pulsed  operation  of  a
superconducting accelerator has been addressed recently in
work at DESY on the Tesla facility, in Japan for the Joint
Project, and at various places for the European Spallation
Source (ESS). The SNS is adding to that work and will
make advances especially with respect to the use of pulsed
superconducting  cavities  for  proton  acceleration.  The
original superconducting design for SNS had external Q’s
of approximately 5e5 and E acc of about 11.9 MV/m. The
resultant effect of Lorentz detuning and microphonics was
relatively small. As the design of SNS has progressed,
however, the external Q’s have increased (to about 7e5)
and Eacc has increased (to 14.2 MV/m). This means that
the effects of Lorentz detuning and microphonics, while
not  at  the  Tesla  level,  have  become  a  more  serious
problem. Current external bandwidths are about 550 Hz,
and the expected microphonics and Lorentz detuning total
is 400 to 500 Hz.

Because it is a proton accelerator, SNS has the added
problem  of  nonzero  synchronous  phase  (to  maintain
longitudinal  bunching).    In  addition,  the  synchronous
phase of the machine varies from one cavity to the next
(over a range of –26.5° to –15°). To minimize the effect
of reflected power, one typically detunes the cavity so that

the reactive effect of the nonzero synchronous phase  is
cancelled by the cavity detuning. With Lorentz forces and
microphonics, it is impossible to maintain exact cavity
detuning. The system must therefore be designed to handle
the reflected power, both in terms of the RF components
and the power capability in the RF source.

4   TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT

AND ALTERNATIVE
CONFIGURATIONS

Other superconducting applications have spent several
years in technology development activities. The SNS is
scheduled to begin  commissioning  in  2005,  with  first
operation in 2006. There is little time for development.
All 105 RF systems must be designed, built, integrated,
installed, and commissioned in only 5 Years. This puts
great emphasis on using what is available, on designing a
robust  system  that  can  accommodate  changes,  and  on
using dependable models for the development.

Many  different  configurations  of  the  linac  and  RF
systems  were  considered  in 
terms  of  the  cost  and
performance. The current baseline,  as  presented  in  this
paper, represents the necessary technology advancements
to  meet  the  performance  requirements  while  staying
within the very tight budget and schedule limitations.

In addition, as in most modern accelerator applications,
there is always the need to consider other applications for
the system in order to make best use of the large capital
investment. In addition to the basic 60 Hz application, we
are considering the repercussions of interleaving a 10 Hz
pulse  pattern  for  a  second  neutron  target.  This  has
implications for the power generation and handling, for
the feedforward control systems, and for the definition of
component  requirements  as  we  begin  making 
the
procurements. The primary consideration at this point is
to  ensure  that  we  do  not  preclude  the  option  of  the
interleaved pulses and the second target.

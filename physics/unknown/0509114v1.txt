Abstract:  

Understanding the mechanical behaviour of bones up to failure is necesary for diagnosis and 

prevention of accident and trauma. As far as we know, no authors have yet studied the tensile 

behaviour of compact bone including failure under dynamic loadings (1m/s). The originality 

of  this  study  comes  from  not  only  the  analysis  of  compact  bone  failure  under  dynamic 

loadings, the results of which are compared to those obtained under quasi static loadings but 

also  the  development  of  a  statistical  model.  We  developed  a  protocol  using  three  different 

devices. Firstly, an X-ray scanner to analyse bone density, secondly, a common tensile device 

to  perform  quasi  static  experiments  and  thirdly,  a  special  device  based  upon  a  hydraulic 

cylinder  to  perform  dynamic  tests.  For  all  the  tests,  we  used  the  same  sample  shape  which 

took  into  account  the  brittleness  of  the  compact  bone.  We  first  performed  relaxation  and 

hysteresis  tests  followed  by  tensile  tests  up  to  failure.  Viscous  and  plastic  effects  were  not 

relevant  to  the  compact  bone  behaviour  so  its  behaviour  was  considered  elastic  and  brittle. 

The  bovine  compact  bone  was  three  to  four  times  more  brittle  under  a  dynamic  load  than 

under  a  quasi  static  one.  Numerically,  a  statistical  model,  based  upon  the  Weibull  theory is 

used to predict the failure stress in compact bone.

1. Introduction 

Bone  failure  often  occurs  in  accidental  shocks  such  as  locomotion,  races,  sports  or  coach 

accidents.  Cortical  bone  shows  tearing,  damage  and  failure  mechanisms  when  it  receives  a 

shock. In the bibliography [1-10], damage and failure of bovine compact bone have already 

been  studied  in  quasi  static  tensile  experiments  and  have  shown  large  variations  of  stress 

failure,  from  100  to  200  MPa,  and  failure  strain,  from  0.4  to  4  %.  However,  none  of  these 

authors had studied compact bone failure under dynamic loads. Other authors have performed 

studies in dynamic [11-12]. Various methods have been used (Hopkinson bar stress method 

and in vivo strain measurements) to characterise the human femoral cortical bone behaviour 

but  for  a  non-damaging  range  of  loadings.  Only  [13]  tested  compact  bone  sample  under 

impact,  for  a  velocity  of  0.3  m/s.  This  velocity  is  not  high  enough  for  application  in 

accidentology and traumatology.  

The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  compare  compact  bone  failure  under  quasi  static  and  dynamic 

tensile loads. A statistical law was used to analyse the stress failure variation and was useful 

in  the  development  of  a  constitutive  law  for  compact  bone.  With  this  aim,  we  created  a 

complete  protocol  comprising  the  following  steps:  firstly,  the  bone  structure  was  analysed 

using  an  X-ray  scanner  to  determine  where  the  structure  was  homogeneous,  secondly, 

hysteresis  and  relaxation  tests  were  performed  to  qualify  the  mechanical  behaviour  of  the 

bone, and thirdly, tensile tests up to failure were carried out; namely, quasi static experiments 

with  a  speed  range  of  0.5  mm/min,  5  mm/min,  10  mm/min  and  500  mm/min  and  dynamic 

experiments with a speed of 1m/s. For all the experiments, tensile strength and displacement 

were  measured.  Finally,  we  analysed  the  failure  using  a  statistical  model  that  took  into 

consideration the biological variability of compact bone behaviour. 

2. Material and method 

2.1. Determination of sample structures 

We  analysed  bone  structure  by  using  an  X-ray  scanner,  type  ND8000,  Laboratoire  de 

Mécanique  et  d’Acoustique.  The  samples  were  taken  from  20  fresh  bovine  femoral  bones. 

Animals were from five to seven years old at the time of death. The bones were frozen prior 

to the experiments. The epiphyses were cut off so that we could concentrate our attention only 

on compact bone. The diaphyses were about 110 mm long and using the X-ray scanner, we 

cut 1 mm thick slices every 10 mm (Fig.1). The scanner was then calibrated to estimate the 

radiological density of bone (CT unit). We found two types of sections. Type I sections where 

the  radiological  density was  900  CT  (±  10  CT),  and  type  II  sections  where  the  radiological 

density varied from 800 CT to 1100 CT. We then used an optical microscope to analyse the 

section  structure  more  accurately.  Type  I  samples  had  a  lamellar  structure,  whereas  type  II 

samples  had  an  osteonal  structure.  We  chose  to  work  on  type  I  samples  that  were  as 

homogeneous  as  possible  in  order  to  reduce  the  number  of  relevant  parameters  which 

explained failure process. We assumed that density had a large influence on failure process, 

so we worked  on  samples with a low density variation assuming,  moreover, that the results 

depended mainly on the presence of defects. These defects may have been characterised by a 

variation in the porosity or in the mechanical characteristics of bones. 

 

 

2.2. Sample shape 

Samples were cut in areas where the bone was homogeneous (type I), namely in the anterior 

lateral  and  anterior  medial  parts.  Bone  shafts  were  taken  and  cut  in  the  axial  direction  and 

marrow  was  removed  from  each  part.  Samples  were  then  machined  with  a  numerically 

controlled  machine  tool.  As  is  classically  done  for  tensile  samples,  the  sample  width  was 

reduced around the centre to localise failure in this part. However, in this case the width was 

gradually reduced and shaped as shown in figure 2 to avoid the appearance of failure close to 

the extremities. After this process, the samples are dry. 

2.3. Qualitative study 

We first performed tests to qualify the model of mechanical behaviour that could describe the 

compact bone behaviour. There are two kinds of loading, namely hysteresis and relaxation. 

2.3.1 Hysteresis experiments 

In  this  part,  we  studied  plasticity  of  bone.  Tensile  experiments  were  carried  out  using  a 

common  tensile  device  -Instron,  Fig.  3(a).  We  imposed  cycles  every  0.1%  of  strain  up  to 

0.5%.  The  realised  displacements  and  the  forces  were  measured.  The  displacement  of  the 

lower  traverse  beam  was  measured  using  an  LVDT  sensor  (Linear  Variable  Differential 

Transformer), attached to the machine frame. The tensile load was measured by a strain gauge 

sensor  with  an  uncertainty  of  measurement  of  1%  on  the  upper  traverse  beam.  These  tests 

 

 

 

were performed on 3 samples.  

2.3.2. Relaxation tests 

Relaxation  tests  are  a  good  way  of  observing  viscous  behaviour.  In  these  experiments, 

displacement, equivalent to strain, was prescribed and the force variations, equivalent to stress 

variations,  were  measured.  Six  samples  were  tested.  We  prescribed  a  strain  of  0.5  %  (0.3 

mm), and a strain rate of 0.26 %/second. The stress was then measured during 60 seconds. 

2.4. Quantitative tests 

Tensile tests were performed up to failure to identify the value of the mechanical quantities 

(Young's  modulus  E  and  failure  stress  σult)  used  to  describe  the  behaviour  of  the  compact 

 

 

 

bone. 

2.4.1. Quasi static experiments 

than 7 seconds. 

2.2 Dynamic experiments 

The experiments were carried out on the same tensile device we used for the hysteresis tests, 

(Fig. 3(a)), with  imposed displacement  (speeds  of  0.5  mm/min,  5  mm/min,  10  mm/min  and 

500 mm/min). The sampling rate of the data acquisition was 10 Hz with tests lasting for more 

We  designed  a  special  device  to  perform  dynamic  tensile  tests  (velocity:  1m/s).  It  was 

attached to a hydraulic jack fixed onto the upper traverse beam,  Fig. 3(b). The force sensor 

was  placed  under  the  lower  chuck  jaw  and  experiments  were  carried  out  using  an  imposed 

displacement. The realised  displacements, velocities,  and accelerations were measured, with 

upper  chuck  jaw  displacements  and  velocities  being  measured  using  a  laser  vibrometer. 

Displacement  was  obtained  by 

interference  measurements  with  an  uncertainty  of 

measurement of 1 %, whereas velocity was measured by the Doppler effect and acceleration 

by  an  accelerometer  fixed  onto  the  upper  chuck  jaw.  Force  was  measured  by  a  triaxial 

piezoelectric  sensor  set  on  the  lower  chuck  jaw,  which  measured  forces  in  the  tensile 

direction, with an uncertainty of measurement of 4.7 %, and in the shear plane. The hydraulic 

device  was  validated  by  carrying  out  tests  on  known  materials.  Measurements  in  the  shear 

plane  showed  a  posteriori  that  tensile  force  was  much  greater  than  flexion  and  shearing 

forces.  An  initial  displacement  of  1/100  mm,  that  is  to  say  a  0.016  %  global  strain,  was 

prescribed in order to avoid dynamic effects due to the assembling of the system, especially 

the clearance. The sampling rate of the data acquisition was 32 kHz with tests lasting about 3 

ms. This high sampling rate led us to use the laser vibrometer whose cut-off frequency was 

A statistical model based on the Weibull theory was developed to analyse tensile results [14; 

15].  Let  V  be  the  reference  volume,  being  constant  for  all  the  samples;  let 

(PR σ

)

  be  the 

failure probability of the volume V subjected to one-dimensional tensile stress σ, that is to say 

the  failure  probability  of  the  sample.  Using  the  function f,  the  failure  probability  was  given 

To  give  an  approximation  of  this  unknown  function  f,  Weibull  proposed  the  following 

higher than the sampling rate.

experimentally  showed the behaviour up to failure. The statistical  model was applied to the

Results 

3.1. Qualitative tests 

3.1.1. Hysteresis tests 

From  these  tests  we  concluded  that  plasticity  could  be  disregarded  when  describing  bone 

behaviour. At the end of the cycle, there was no residual plastic strain, the stress-strain curve 

(Fig  4)  was  linear.  In  addition,  the  facies  failure  (Fig  5)  confirmed  that  compact  bone  is  a 

brittle material as no plastic strain was observed. 

3.1.2. Relaxation tests 

Results are presented in figure 6. They show that only an elastic return was observed after the 

sample was placed under tension. Relaxation effects were not significant enough, allowing us 

to conclude that compact bone material does not relax.  

In conclusion, the qualitative tests justified the use of an elastic model for the compact bone 

in quasi-static and dynamic cases.  

3.2. Quantitative tests 

3.2.1.  Tensile experiments under quasi static loads 

From  these  results,  the  mechanical  properties  of  compact  bone  were  deduced  where  failure 

occurred.  Stress-strain  curves  were  divided  into  three  parts  (Fig  7).  On  the  first  part  of  the 

curve  where  the  behaviour  was  linear  elastic,  Young's  modulus  could  be  calculated. On  the 

second part, one could observe that the behaviour became weakly non-linear, showing that the 

material was damaged. In the final stage failure occurred suddenly. The damaging part of the 

bone behaviour could be neglected as this behaviour was not relevant to describe bone failure, 

because the non linearity is weak. Hence, this behaviour was represented by a brittle elastic 

model, and was defined by Young's modulus E and the ultimate stress 

ultσ . 

Results are presented in table 1. Failure strain and stress varied greatly from one quasi-static 

experiment  to  another,  so  the  failure  stress  values  probably  depended  on  the  distribution  of 

defects in the sample. The largest defect in the structure could have been the one that caused 

the  failure.  The  measured  failure  stresses  varied  by  84%,  and  Young’s  Modulus  by  55%. 

These  results  however  are  in  line  with  those  published  [1;  4;  5;  7;  21;  22].  This  broad 

variation  justified  the  use  of  a  statistical  model  that  takes  into  account  the  whole  range  of 

behaviours that we observed.

This law is plotted in figure 8(a). The failure probability defines a constitutive law of compact 

 

bone. 

Using  this  law,  we  gained  statistical  information  on  failure  probability.  For  example,  we 

found that there was no possibility of sample failure for a stress lower than 50 MPa, a 46% 

chance  of  sample  failure  for  a  stress  lower  than  150  MPa  and  a  sample  failure  for  stresses 

greater than 220 MPa was certain in our study case. In fact, the number of samples is weak 

and results depend on the biological variability of bone behaviour. 

 

 

case. 

3.2.2.  Tensile experiments under dynamic loads 

When  experimenting,  we  found  the  same  three  parts  as  in  the  quasi  static  case  for  bone 

behaviour  (Fig  9)  and  used  a  brittle  elastic  behaviour  model.  As  in  quasi-static,  no  plastic 

strain  was  observed  on  the  failure  facies.  Only  the  second  part,  where  bone  behaviour  was 

non-linear  and  where  the  bone  was  damaged,  was  more  obvious.  As  we  were  interested  in 

bone  failure,  we  used  the  same  elastic  and  brittle  model  of  behaviour  as  in  the  quasi  static 

Results are summarized in table 1. As in quasi-static, the distribution of defects in the sample 

led  to  strain  and  stress  failures  which  varied  greatly  from  one  experiment  to  another  in 

dynamic.  The  largest  defect  in  the  structure  may  have  been  the  one  that  caused  the  failure. 

Failure stresses varied by about 72%, which corresponded to a large variation under dynamic 

loads, and Young’s Modulus by about 115%. A statistical model was then useful as in quasi 

static cases. Stress and strain failures were lower in the dynamic case than in the quasi static 

case. However, the same range of variations of Young’s modulus values were obtained in the 

two cases. 

 We then identified the parameters of the statistical law as: m=7.3 and K=-27.1, R = 0.98. 

The

The  failure  probability  and  the  constitutive  law  of  compact  bone  under  dynamic  load  are 

plotted in figure 8(b). 

We found, in this case, that there was no possibility of failure for a stress lower than 15 MPa, 

a 57 % chance of sample failure for a stress lower than 40 MPa, and a sample failure for a 

stress greater than 55 MPa was certain in our study. 

 

 

4. Conclusions and discussion. 

The  originality  of  our  approach  consisted  firstly,  in  studying  bone  failure  under  dynamic 

loadings  (1m/s)  secondly,  in  comparing  these  results  with  those  obtained  under  quasi  static 

loadings  and  thirdly,  in  developing  a  statistical  model.  Moreover  this  statistical  model  has 

been developed to be implemented in finite elements software to predict bone lesions due to 

an impact. To do so, we developed a protocol using three different devices by combining the 

use of a microscope and an X-ray scanner as well as quasi static and dynamic tensile devices. 

The same variation of results was obtained using the two devices with quasi static loads. The 

large range of variation observed in both cases and the brittle properties of compact bones led 

to  the  development  of  a  statistical  model.  Failure  stress  in  the  two  cases  showed  that  the 

compact bovine bone was three to  four  times more brittle under  dynamic load than under a 

quasi static one (see table 1). As the viscous effect was disregarded, the observed differences 

between quasi-static and dynamic behaviour were probably due to the fibrous bone structure. 

The  compact  bone  fibres  could  have  been  responsible  for  the  observed  stress  diminution. 

Indeed,  in  all  the  specimens,  there  were  three  types  of  lamellar  structure  whose  fibres  were 

oriented  longitudinally,  obliquely  and  transversally;  that  is  to  say,  at  0°,  45°  and  90°  with 

respect  to  the  longitudinal  axis  of  the  structure  [23-26].  In  the  dynamic  case,  the  velocity 

experiment may have prevented fibres from turning in the tensile direction and causing shear 

stresses  along  the  fibres.  Consequently  fibres  may  have  been  damaged  and  become  more 

brittle. 

The same protocol could have been applied to healthy human bones or to pathological ones, 

such  as,  for  example,  osteoporotic  or  cancerous  bones  for  example.  Obviously  this  study  is 

limited to the fact that in vivo the bone is embedded in a complex muscular and ligamentous 

system  being  totally  different  from  the  experimental  setup  in  the  study.  However,  our  topic 

was a classical mechanical approach to identify bone characteristics in order to define bone 

behaviour  and  obtain  data  to  insert  them  into  a  human  virtual  model.  Dynamic  loading  are 

found in areas of human motion or accidentology where our work can be used. Examples are 

locomotion or racing and also in sports or car accidents. 

This work, and particularly the extension of the statistical method, provides the possibility of 

predicting  bone  failure  and  could  lead  to  applications  in  computer-assisted  surgery  (CAS). 

Only  a  small  number  of  samples  were  tested,  but  it  was  sufficient  enough  to  provide  an 

estimation  of  the  failure  law.  In  parallel  to  these  experiments,  we  developed  a  numerical 

model  of  the  microscopic  behaviour  of  compact  bone  at  failure  under  quasi  static  and 

dynamic  loads  [14].  Our  aim  is  now  to  apply  the  statistical  model,  obtained  at  the 

macroscopic  level,  to  a  microscopic  model  to  predict  the  lesion  occurrence  and  the  damage 

propagation in the structure.

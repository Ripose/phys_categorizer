Abstract  :  We  report  on  the  analysis  of  FM  selective  reflection  experiments  on  the 

6S1/2→8P3/2  transition  of  Cs  at  388  nm,  and  on  the  measurement  of  the  surface  van  der 

Waals interaction exerted by a sapphire interface on Cs(8P3/2). Various improvements in the 

systematic  fitting  of  the  experiments  have  permitted  to  supersede  the  major  difficulty  of  a 

severe overlap of the hyperfine components, originating on the one hand in a relatively small 

natural structure, and on the other hand on a large pressure broadening imposed by the high 

atomic  density  needed  for  the  observation  of  selective  reflection  on  a  weak  transition.  The 

strength  of  the  van  der  Waals  surface  interaction  is  evaluated  to  be  73±10    kHz.µm3.  An 

evaluation  of  the  pressure  shift  of  the  transition  is  also  provided  as  a  by-product  of  the 

measurement. We  finally discuss the significance  of  an apparent disagreement between the 

experimental measurement of the surface interaction, and the theoretical value calculated for 

an  electromagnetic  vacuum  at  a  null  temperature.  The  possible  influence  of  the  thermal 

excitation of the surface is evoked, because, the dominant contributions to the vW interaction 

for Cs(8P3/2) lie in the  far infrared range.

 1. Introduction 

 

 

 

The  long-range  atom-surface  attraction  is  a  fundamental  effect  that  ultimately 

explains the cohesion of the matter. If the experimental evaluations of this interaction remain 

scarce  with  respect  to  its  universality    (see  e.g.[1]  and  references  therein)  and  to  the 

extremely  broad  range  of  energy  it  spans  over,  available  measurements  have  confirmed  a 

reasonable  agreement  with  the  theoretical  predictions.  In  the  principle,  the  accuracy  of  the 

theory  is  potentially  very  high,  as  simply  dependent  upon  the  determinations  of  atomic 

wavefunctions,  that  have  been  precisely  known  for  a  long  time  as  far  as  alkali-metal  are 

concerned. If recent fascinating advances were recently demonstrated in the related Casimir 

interaction between two surfaces [2], the near-field regime for which the retardation effects 

can  be  neglected  permits  to  enter  into  the  frame  of  the  electrostatic  van  der  Waals  (vW) 

surface interaction [3-5], allowing to simply consider an interaction between the fluctuating 

atom  dipole  and  its  induced  electrostatic  image.  This  approach  implicitly  assumes  the 

vacuum field to be at null temperature. However, the atom-surface coupling is known to be 

strongly  sensitive  to  the  virtual  dipole  couplings  to  neighbouring  energy  levels  between  an 

atomic  level  and  its  neighbours,  so  that  high-lying  states  are  mostly  sensitive  to  a  vW 

interaction whose dominant origin lies in far infrared (IR) couplings [1,6,7]. In such a case, 

the temperature of the surface, governing at equilibrium the temperature of the vacuum field, 

may affect the atom-surface interaction [8-11], hence providing a simple example of atomic 

quantum properties affected by  a thermal bath [12].  Such a modification of the atom-surface 

interaction  can  be  particularly  expected  when  the  atomic  coupling  in  the  thermal  IR  range 

exhibits a resonant coincidence with a thermally populated surface mode. 

 

The present work is devoted to an attempt of a precise experimental evaluation of the 

surface  interaction  exerted  on  a  Cs  atom  in  the  8P3/2  level,  a  level  undergoing  a  notable 

(absorption)  coupling  to  Cs(7D)  through  transitions  lying  in  the  thermal  infrared:  the 

wavelength of the 8P3/2→7D3/2  line is 39µm, corresponding to T = 500 K , while the one of  

the  8P3/2→7D5/2    line  is  36µm  corresponding  to  T  =  550  K.  The  results  presented  here  are 

obtained  at  the  interface  with  a  sapphire  window,  a  material  without  surface  resonances  in 

this thermal IR range. Although these measurements were acquired for various Cs densities 

(and  vapour  temperatures),  the  variations  of  the  temperature  of  the  window  remain 

negligible. They were mostly intended to provide a reference experiment and a feasibility test 

in  view  of  planned  investigations,  on  the  same  atomic  level  Cs  (8P3/2),  of  a  severe 

temperature dependence of the surface interaction [9], when surfaces such as CaF2 or BaF2

exhibit electromagnetic mode resonances in the far thermal IR susceptible to couple with the 

virtual atomic absorption [10]. 

Our present experimental evaluation relies on an analysis of the Selective Reflection 

(SR)  spectra  obtained  at  a  normal  incidence,  at  a  sapphire  interface  on  the  third  resonance 

line  of  Cs  (6S1/2→8P3/2)  at  388  nm.  We  have  developed  for  a  long  time  linear  SR 

spectroscopy, in order to be able to extract, through an elaborate lineshape analysis [1,8,13-
15],  the  strength  C3  of  the  vW  interaction,  that  shifts  the  transition  energy  as  C3 z-3  (z:  the 

atom-surface distance). Indeed, SR spectroscopy, which turns to be a Doppler-free technique 

in its Frequency-Modulated (FM) version [16], typically probes a region λ/2π away from the 

surface. The encountered experimental challenges are here comparable to those solved long 

ago for our first observation of the "strong" van der Waals regime on the (relatively weak) 

line of second resonance of Cs (6S1/2-7P3/2, λ=455 nm)[6,7]. The major difficulties lie in  the 
weakness of  the optical transition -the oscillator strength is  ~10-3 -, and in the very narrow 

hyperfine structure (see fig.1). Hence, high atomic densities must be employed for sensitivity 

reasons,  implying  a  pressure  broadening  that  tends  to  make  the  hyperfine  components 

unresolved. Also, the experiment requires  a tuneable  UV laser, here provided by a specific 

diode laser. 

2. Experimental observations 

As  usual  for  such  a  vW  measurement  through  SR  spectroscopy,  the  set-up  (fig.  1) 

comprises  a  tuneable  FM  laser,  the  SR  experiment  itself,  that  requires  a  cell  of  heated  Cs 

vapour,  and  an  auxiliary  Saturated  Absorption  (SA)  experiment,  providing  the  frequency 

reference needed to evaluate the vW interaction affetcing the SR spectrum. 

The laser is a commercial extended cavity diode laser (Toptica DL 100). It includes a 

grating  for  line  selection  in  Littrow  configuration,  and  itis  equipped  with  a  wavelength-

selected  semi-conductor  chip  able  to  cover  the  387.7  nm  and  388.9  nm  respective  lines 

6S1/2→8P3/2  and  6S1/2→8P1/2.  Until  now,  the  experiments  have  been  limited  to  the 

6S1/2→8P3/2  transition, because the known Cs fine structure anomaly [17] is responsible for a 

weak  oscillator  strength  of  the    6S1/2→8P1/2  transition  -  weaker  than  the  6S1/2→8P3/2 

transition  by about an order of magnitude-.  The output power does not exceed 3 mW, and 

drops to ~1mW after optical isolation and some spatial cleaning of the beam structure. The 

long-term  laser  jitter,  essentially  governed  by  the  relative  length  stability  of  the  extended 

cavity,  is  ~4  MHz,  twice  larger  than  currently  obtained  in  the  near  IR  with  an  analogous

cavity. The FM (at 12 kHz) is here applied directly through the laser drive current. The laser 

has the ability to scan more than 10 GHz, notably covering the 9.2 GHz of the Cs hyperfine 

structure of the ground state. This is obtained however at the expense of an important change 

(~50  %)  in  the  laser  intensity,  connected  to  the  near-threshold  operation  (Iop ≤ 44mA, 

Ith ≈ 39mA)  with  an  external  grating  coupling  of  our  specific  UV  diode  laser.  Our  study 

actually  concentrates  on  narrow  (  ≤  1  GHz)  regions  of  the  spectra  but  for  long  scans,  this 

would  imply  to  renormalize  our  recordings  with  the  actual  output  power.  Tests  of  the 

linearity  of  the  frequency  scan  with  the  drive  voltage,  conducted  with  the  help  of  a  Fabry-

Perot analyzer, reveals variations on extended scans (~ 10 GHz) by up  to ±10% . This non 

linearity,  attributed  to  a  nonlinearity  in  the  PZT  that  drives  the  grating,  remains  mostly 

quadratic,  making  shorter  scans  more  linear,  but  with  a  novel  calibration  (drive  voltage vs. 

frequency) required each time that the frequency interval is modified. The vapour cells are T-

shaped  sealed  cells,  described  elsewhere,  with  sapphire  windows  (c-axis  perpendicularly 

oriented), that are compatible with a high temperature vapour. The windows are contacted to 

a metallic tube [6,7] or to a sapphire tube [18]. They are  independently heated up in a two-

chambers system - main body, and Cs reservoir- , with the Cs reservoir temperature normally 

governing  the  atomic  density,  and  the  windows  slightly  overheated  (by  ~  20°  C)  to  avoid 

condensation.  

 

The linear nature  of SR spectroscopy  makes  the  (FM)  SR  signal  relatively  easily  to 

detect,  independently  of  the  incident  beam  power  (≤1mW),  and  diameter  (~1  mm). 

Moreover, and in spite of the weakness of the oscillator strength,  the low amplitude noise of 

our UV diode laser makes the SR detection less challenging than with a blue dye laser, such 

as used in [6,7]. Note that the ultimately attained sensitivity is not exactly as good as for near 

IR resonance lines, where the photonic shot-noise limit can be approached : this is partly due 

to  the  non  ideal  quantum  sensitivity  of  the  photodetector  -  even  for  a  "UV  enhanced" 

photodiode-,  partly  to  the  technical  noise  of  the  UV  laser,  that  operates  relatively  near-

threshold.  The  relative  change  ΔR/R,  in  excess  of  10-4  for  Cs  temperatures  typically 

exceeding 160 °C (see fig.2a) , is conveniently observed through a synchronous detection of 

the FM provided that the FM amplitude is comparable to the SR signal width. However, as 

illustrated in fig 2, the required high temperatures and densities ( ≥ 5.1014 at/cm3) makes the 

hyperfine  structure  hardly  recognizable,  when  not  totally  hindered.  Moreover,  the 

combination of dispersive-like shapes (typical of (FM) SR spectroscopy) and of strong vW-

components. 

induced distortion and broadening, implies a strong overlap between the individual hyperfine 

In some sense, the auxiliary SA experiment poses more experimental difficulties than 

the SR set-up itself. In spite of a much longer effective length of interaction (the SA cell is 

1cm-long, while the SR experiment typically probes a region ≤100 nm from the interface), 

the nonlinear nature of the SA experiment, combined with the weak oscillator strength and 

the limited available power, imposes a strong beam focusing ( ~50 µm diameter, practically 

limited  by  the  onset  of  divergence  after  a  Rayleigh  length),  and  subsequent  careful  pump-

probe alignment. To eliminate the residual Doppler-broadened linear absorption appearing in 

a  (FM)  SA  experiment,  a  chopper  for  amplitude  modulation  (AM)  is  implemented  on  the 

pump beam. A few % of linear absorption, along with narrow SA lineshapes, is obtained for 

a  Cs  temperature  in  the  80-100°C  range.  In  these  conditions,  the  SA  lineshapes  are  hence 

insensitive  to  moderate  temperature  variations,  establishing  that  they  provide  an  adequate 

frequency  reference  for  the  isolated  atom  transition.  Anyhow,  one  notes  obvious 

imperfections in the SA spectra, that should normally be composed of successive Lorentzians 

:  the  relatively  long  scan  time  imposed  to  get  acceptable  signal-to-noise  ratio  through  the 

integration time (time constant of the detection : 0.1 s) makes indeed the experiment sensitive 

to short-term drifts affecting the laser frequency. 

 

The essence of the experiments consists, for various temperature conditions of the SR 

cell, of the simultaneous recording of the (FM) SR spectrum and of the (AM) SA reference 

spectrum. As usual in the analysis of SR spectroscopy for vW extraction [6-8], the key-point 

is to extract a fixed atom-surface interaction in spite of phenomenological changes appearing 

in the SR lineshapes when modifying the pressure effects (i.e. the relative influence of  the 

atom-atom interaction). The spectra were recorded in scans of a limited amplitude (≤ 1 GHz), 

and  repeated  to  study  successively  the  two  hyperfine  components  6S1/2(F=3)→8P3/2  and 

6S1/2(F=4)→8P3/2. In spite of differences in the hyperfine structure of Cs(8P3/2), that remains 

unresolved  in  the  context  of  SR  experiments,  the  two  components  F=3→F'=2,3,4  and 

F=4→F'=3,4,5  normally provide a similar information relatively to the 8P3/2 level. Indeed, 

the  surface  vW  interaction  is  expected  to  be    insensitive  to  the  considered  hyperfine 

component  as  long  as  the  Zeeman  degeneracy  is  not  removed  [6,19].  This  redundancy 

provides a complementary opportunity to test the consistency of interpretation.   

Additionally,  auxiliary  tests  of  broadening  and  shift  of  the  SA  reference  spectrum 

have been performed, in an attempt to compare, in the same vapour conditions, the volume

spectra,  and  vW-sensitive  SR  spectra.  For  this  purpose,  auxiliary  SA  experiments  (fig.3) 

were  performed  on  a  100µm-thick  Cs  glass  cell.  This  short  thickness  allows  a  high  Cs 

density  without  a  too  strong  absorption.  In  this  regime,  the  SA  experiments  undergo  an 

important broadening, that goes along a pressure shift. Interpretation of these pressure effects 

is discussed in the next section. 

3. Data Analysis 

As  described  in  several  of  our  previous  works  [1],  our  evaluation  of  the  vW 

interaction  relies  on  a  comparison  between  the  experimental  (FM)  SR  lineshapes  and  a 

family of theoretical spectra [20, 21] depending on a single dimensionless parameter A that 
characterizes  the  vW  interaction    [A = 2 C3 k3 /  γ,  with  k = 2π/λ,  and  C3  the  vW  coefficient 
governing the energy shift  ΔE = - C3 z-3, with z the atom-surface distance). These calculated 

spectra undergo a combined shift and distortion relatively to the ideal vW-free (i.e. A=0) SR 

spectrum that would be obtained in similar conditions of atomic environment. Hence, it is a 

preliminary requirement to estimate the shift and broadening induced by the atom collision 

processes,  such  as  those  visibly  appearing  in  the  SA  recordings  at  the  higher  temperatures 

(see  fig.  3).  Alternately,  the  pressure  broadening  and  shift  can  be  extracted  from  the  SR 

spectrum by increasing the number of adjustable parameters in the fitting methods [6,7,14]. 

However, this  usually increases uncertainties, and is sometimes paid  by a  limited radius  of 

convergence  of  the  adjustments.  Moreover,  in  such  an  evaluation  based  on  the  SR 

experiment,  the  consistency  of  the  pressure  determination  (e.g.  linearity)  has  to  be 

established. 

3.1 Saturated Absorption and collision processes 

   

Because of the limited linear absorption in a 100µm-thick cell, the SA spectra can be 

recorded  in  temperature  conditions  approaching  those  used  in  SR  recordings.  A  limited 

number  of  temperature  (pressure)  is  needed  to  get  an  estimate  of  the  collision  effects 

affecting  the  resonance.  However,  the  ample  overlaps  between  the  hyperfine  components, 

and  even  the  vanishing  resolution    of  the  hyperfine  components  for  the  higher  Cs  density, 

have  imposed  to  use  fitting  methods  to  exploit  the  data.  The  lineshape  of  the  individual 

hyperfine  components  can  reasonably  be  assumed  to  be  Lorentzian.  The  main  difficulty  is 

that  the  individual  amplitude  of  the  various  components  can  a  priori  vary  independently 

because SA is a nonlinear process. Moreover, the pressure shift and broadenings themselves 

P.C.S. Segundo et al.               Selective Reflection spectroscopy on the third resonance line... 

7

 

 

 

could depend on the considered hyperfine component. This is why several fittings methods 

were  compared  [22],  and  notably:  (i)  a  fully  adjustable  one,  that  includes  a  total  of  16 

parameters, namely a global "offset" parameter along with 3 parameters (position, amplitude 

and  width)  for  each  of  the  "5"  individual  components  (there  are  3  main  hyperfine 

components  and  3  additional  Doppler  crossover  resonances,  but  the  3-5  crossover  and  the 

F'=4  principal  component  are  intrinsically  unresolved)  ;  (ii)  one  with  individually  varying 

amplitudes (because the saturation intensity strongly depends on the  broadening itself), but 

for  which  the  pressure  effect  imposes  an  identical  pressure  broadening  and  shift  for  all 

components; and (iii) a "global" one, for which in addition, the relative amplitudes are fixed  

(and  determined  by  their  relative  values  measured  in  low  density  conditions).  As  shown  in 

figure 4, all these numerical methods yield comparable results, justifying not to discriminate 

between  the  hyperfine  components.  Indeed,  it  is  essentially  when  the  h.f.s  is  well-resolved 

that individual behaviours can be expected. In our present experimental conditions, the h.f.s. 

is already washed out by the pressure broadening. The accuracy of the results, especially for 

frequency shifts that amounts to less than 10 MHz, is anyhow affected by the laser jitter and 

lack of reproducibility in small-scale frequency scan. Note that convergence of the numerical 

fitting  is  more  easily  obtained  for  moderate  temperature  (i.e.  hyperfine  structure  partially 

resolved),  than  for  the  higher  temperature  when  the  pressure  broadening  smears  out  the 

hyperfine  structure.  From  this  SA  analysis,  we  can  extract  an  evaluation  for  the  pressure 

broadening    (~    180  MHz/Torr)  and  shift  (~  - 60  MHz/Torr).  However,  the  high-level  of 

uncertainty on these data, notably related to the pressure uncertainty (as extrapolated from a 

temperature measured with a few degrees uncertainty) (see e.g. [14]), would make it highly 

hazardous to convert these estimates into a known correction  imposed for the analysis of SR 

spectra.  Rather,  because  the  pressure  shift  remains  in  most  cases  comparable  to  the  laser 

jitter, the estimated SA pressure shift can be included in the consistency check when fitting 

the SR spectra. Similarly, the pressure uncertainty when comparing SR and SA experiments 

at a same nominal temperature explains why it is not convenient in the SR fitting to impose 

the pressure broadening as estimated from the SA experiment. 

3.2 Analysis of Selective Reflection spectra 

As justified by our results concerning the SA spectra, our fittings for the SR spectra 

generally assume an adjustable width γ and shift Δ identical for all hyperfine components. An 

identical vW interaction, governed by a single C3 coefficient [23] is also assumed. Moreover, 

and owing to the linear nature of SR spectroscopy, the SR spectra can be fitted by taking as 

P.C.S. Segundo et al.               Selective Reflection spectroscopy on the third resonance line... 

 

8

the relative amplitudes of the hyperfine components those imposed by the angular factors for 

transition  probabilities  [7].  The  SR  fittings  hence  result  from  the  optimal  least-square 

adjustments obtained, for a series of A values, through simple homothetic changes relatively 

to the theoretical shape. Figure 5 illustrates, for a given SR spectrum, a choice of A values 

producing  acceptable  (or  nearly  acceptable)  fits.  The  experimental  spectrum  being  here 

recorded at a temperature for which the hyperfine structure is hardly resolved, and for which 

a  possible  pressure  shift  has  to  be  considered,  the  a  priori  position  of  the  individual  SR 

hyperfine components is determined with respect to the corresponding  positions in the SA 

spectrum [24], and after addition of a pressure shift identical for all h.f. components. For a 

more systematic determination of the range of acceptable A parameters, we plot as in fig. 6a 

the total error value for the optimal fit for a given A value, as a function of the A value.  Such 

a  plot  is  especially  of  interest  when  the  pressure  broadening  washes  out  details  in  the  SR 

spectrum,  so  that  numerous  fits,  for  a  large  range  of  A  values,  can  produce  resembling 

spectra. As shown in fig. 6b, it appears that in the considered strong vW regime, the fitted γ 

value itself is strongly dependent upon the choice of the A parameter - see (fig 6b)- . This 

behaviour is at the opposite of the one in weak (A<<1) vW regime, when the determination 

of the width γ is nearly A-independent [14]. As  can be seen in fig. 6c, such a behaviour tends  

to  compensate  for  the  uncertainty  on  the  optimal  A  parameter,  hence  reducing  the  overall 

uncertainty on Aγ or C3.  

Through the development of an automated numerical method of fitting [22], we could 

perform  a  more  systematic  determination  of  the  optimal  vW  value  fitting  the  experiments, 

increasing the confidence in the C3 determination. Instead of optimizing a freely adjustable 

"pressure shift" -ultimately expected to be proportional to pressure- , we have systematically 

compared the fitting values assuming a given shift between the SA reference and the SR cell. 

In this exploration, the given shift is typically changed by a few MHz increments. As shown 

in fig 7a, the region of optimal A value drifts under this hypothetic shift, while correlatively 

the cloud of acceptable values of γ remains horizontal. The estimated width γ hence appears 

independent  of  the  hypothetic  pressure  shift.  Fig.  7c  shows  that  this  method  provides  a 

narrow  range  of  acceptable  values  of  Aγ  (i.e.  of  C3).  In  addition,  the  amplitude  of  the  SR 

spectrum, after normalization relatively to the theoretical vW curve, provides in the principle  

a measurement of the number of interacting atoms [6,25]. Note that this "signal amplitude" 

remains  nearly  unaffected  by  the  precise  choice  of  the  hypothetic  shift,  provided  that  one 

chooses accordingly the optimal A value.

The  major  results  of  our  analysis  are  shown  in  fig.  8,  where  the  results  of  the  SR 

fittings, including the uncertainties resulting from the range of acceptable "pressure" shifts, 

are  synthesized  as  a  function  of  Cs  pressure.  Remarkably,  the  C3  value  extracted  from  the 

various  fittings  is  independent  of  the  pressure.  The  value  to  be  retained,    C3  =  73  ±  10 
kHz.µm3 , is noticeably larger than the one found for the second resonance line of Cs (~ 10-
20  kHz.µm3)[6,7],  and  comparable  in  magnitude  -but  here  for  an  attraction-  to  the  "giant" 
repulsion (~ -160 kHz.µm3) [8] obtained in a situation  of resonant coupling. Note that part of 

the  uncertainty  in  this  C3  value  can  be  traced  back  to  the  uncertainty  in  the  frequency 

calibration  for  small  frequency  scans.  Moreover,  the  extrapolated  widths,  shifts,  and 

amplitude, evolve linearly with the Cs pressure. This is a major a posteriori justification of 

the pressure origin of the ad hoc shift introduced in the fitting method. One approximately 

extracts a 280 MHz/Torr dependence for γ, and a - 90   MHz/Torr value for Δ. Also, these 

estimated  pressure  effects  are  compatible  with  the  estimates  extracted  from  the  SA 

experiment. Note that the large uncertainty in the absolute pressure calibration (a 5°C error in 

the temperature measurement may modify the pressure scale by 40 %), makes the SR and SA 

comparison  imprecise,  but  does  not  affect  the  internal  coherence  of  measurements  mainly 

sensitive to temperature variations. also independent of the considered hyperfine initial level 

6S1/2(F=3), or 6S1/2(F=4). Also, the extracted C3 values are found to be the same (within 5 %)  

for the F=4→F'={3,4,5} and F=3→F'={2,3,4}components [26].  

4. Discussion and comparison with the theoretical predictions   

The  C3  measured  coefficient  in  SR  spectroscopy  is  related  to  the  dissimilar  vW 

attraction  exerted  on  the  final  (⏐f>)  and  initial  (⏐i>)    states  (i.e.  C3 = C3(⏐f>) - C3(⏐i>)]. 

Because  the  VW  attraction  quickly  increases  with  the  atomic  excitation,  and  is  roughly 

connected with the atomic level polarizability [3], one has in our case C3(6S1/2) << C3(8P3/2) . 
With  C3(6S1/2) ≤ 2kHz.µm3,  one  simply  deduces  that  the  measured  C3  =  73  ±  10  kHz.µm3 

totally  applies  to  C3(8P3/2).  In  an  evaluation  entirely  analogous  to  previous  ones,  Table  1 

shows  how  the  various  dipole  couplings  relevant  for  the  8P3/2  level  of  Cs  respectively 

contribute to the vW attraction coefficient C3(8P3/2). The different columns are relevant for 

an interface either with an ideal reflector, either with a sapphire interface. Because there are 

no coincidences between sapphire surface resonances, and the dipole transitions reaching  the 

8P3/2  level  of  Cs,  the  dielectric  coefficients  are  not  dramatically  sensitive  to  uncertainties 

affecting the sapphire properties or orientation [8,27].

It is remarkable that in spite of the expected accuracy of the theoretical prediction, the 

measured C3 value appears sensitively higher - by a factor 1.5- than the expected one ( ~ 45 
kHz.µm3),  and  hence  closer  to  the  value  predicted  for  an  ideal  reflector  than  with  the 

dielectric  image  factor  taken  into  account.  We  do  not  have  at  the  present  time  a  fully 

satisfactory  explanation  of  this  fact.  The  laser  jitter,  although  leading  to  a  lineshape 

broadening, susceptible to  modify the family of  theoretical  vW  lineshapes themselves does 

not appear susceptible to modify sensitively our C3 value estimate. However, Table 1 shows 

that more than 60% of the C3 value originates in the virtual absorption, located in the far IR 

range, towards the 7 D level. Even for a material like sapphire that does not exhibit a surface 

resonance  around  this  36-39µm  range,  the  theoretical  modelling  of  a  vacuum  at  zero 

temperature  should  no  longer  hold.  Rather,  modifications  of  the  vW  interaction  are  to  be 

expected  with  our  hot  sapphire  surface  (for  the  overheated  window,  we  have  currently  T 

~450-500K). The evaluation of this non resonant thermal effect appears tractable after recent 

theoretical  developments  [9].  Also,  straightforward  extrapolations  based  upon  the  sapphire 

properties as measured at room temperature could be invalid, because the sapphire dielectric 

susceptibility itself could be modified in the thermal IR range, when high  temperatures  are 

considered. It is interesting to note that if a thermal influence on the vW surface interaction 

has never been reported, the high precision experiments on Cs Rydberg levels [3] had been 

performed  at  room  temperature,  with  no  noticeable  deviation  in  the  interaction  strength, 

relatively to the T=0 prediction, although the dominant  dipole couplings lie in a very remote 

IR range, Meanwhile, these experiments on Rydberg atoms were not performed in a genuine 

half-space  but  between  two  walls,  so  that,  as demonstrated  for  the  real  transfer  induced  by 

the surface thermal excitation [28], the sub-wavelength cavity may prevent the influence of 

the thermal excitation on the vW interaction.  

Finally,  the  remaining  disagreement  between  our  experimental  findings,  and  the 

theoretical  prediction  (as  evaluated  in  a  T=0  approach,  and  assuming  for  sapphire  similar 

properties  than  at  room  temperature),  appears  because  of  our  refined  accuracy  in  the 

interpretation  of  SR  data.  Until  now  [1,  6-8,  13,14],  the  agreement  between  the  theoretical 

predictions and the experiments had remained within error bars that were much larger. If part 

of  our  present  experimental  uncertainty  can  even  be  attributed  to  defects  in  the  frequency 

scale  calibration,  a  10  %  accuracy  could  be  envisioned  with  a  better  control  of  the  laser 

frequency scan.  From  the  extreme  quality of the overlap between the  experimental spectra, 

and the complex fitting curves, requiring a restricted number of parameters, one may feel that 
one holds a clear evidence of a z-3  behaviour. In spite of that, one cannot totally exclude the

influence of phenomena related with the surface state itself that are not taken into account. In 

particular  the  effect  of  the  local  roughness  of  the  surface  (i.e.  z  would  be  replaced  by  a 

locally-averaged <z> value) could become more important than in previous situations, owing 

to  the  relatively  short  wavelength  that  we  use,  implying  a  more  accurate  spatial  resolution  

[5]. Also, residual electric fields at the surface,  as possibly existing on a dielectric surface, or 

as induced by residual Cs layers, are  susceptible to induce a Stark shift,  to which  Cs  (8P) 

could  be  more  sensitive  than  in  most  previous  experiments,  owing  to  a  higher  degree  of 

 

  

electronic excitation.

[21]  We  include  the  finite  Doppler  width  correction  when  significant  (see  refs.  1  and  14). 

This  correction  is  most  often  marginal  because  the  widths  remain  small  relatively  to  a 

Doppler width twice larger than for a resonance line in the IR. 

[22] P.C.S. Segundo, PhD dissertation, UFPb (João Pessoa, Brazil) (Nov 2005), unpublished. 

[23] No significant deviation to this hypotheses can be established by our various attempts to 

fit the SR spectra with parameters allowing a dependence on the hyperfine component (e.g. 

for the pressure effect or the vW interaction).  

[24]  Note  that  the  frequency  referencing  operated  for  each  individual  hyperfine  component  

is  responsible  for  some  uncertainties  in  the  frequency  scale,  owing  to  micro-nonlinearities 

affecting  the  frequency  scan:  the  relative  distance  between  the  components  of  the  SA 

reference can indeed appear in slight disagreement with the expected hyperfine structure. 

[25]  Even  if  an  absolute  calibration  of  the  SR  signal  often  reveals  to  be  delicate  (e.g.  the 

ΔR/R value may be affected by scattering losses for the nonresonant reflection coefficient R), 

the  information  on  the  relative  amplitude  is  significant  when  comparing  spectra  solely 

differing by the atomic density. 

[26]  Our  values  were  mostly  obtained  when  analyzing  data  for  the  6S1/2  (F=4)→8  P3/2 

component, and the experiments for the 6S1/2 (F=3)→8 P3/2 component corresponds to a later 

series  of  experiments.  Although  the  same  Aγ  value  is  found  (see  fig.  8a),  smaller  pressure 

broadening and shifts are obtained, that remain however compatible with the SA data (NB :  

no 

systematic  SA 

analysis  was  performed  on 

the  SA 

spectra 

for 

the 

F=3→F'={2,3,4}component).  We  suspect  a  change  has  occurred  in  the  positioning  of  our 

temperature probes, from which the pressure is evaluated.

Figure 1  : Scheme of the experimental set-up, with the atomic energy levels relevant for the 

6S1/2→ 8P3/2 transition of Cs. The output beam of the isolator needs to be optically isolated -

"O.I." -, and cleaned-up with a spatial filter. 

Figure 2 : Experimental (FM) SR  lineshapes on the  F=4 →F'={3,4,5} component of 6S1/2→ 
8P3/2 transition of Cs as recorded at : (a) T= 172°C, or ~ 6.1014 at/cm3 ; (b) T= 181°C, or ~ 
9.1014  at/cm3  ;  (c)  T=227°C,  or  ~  5.1015  at/cm3.  The  SA  reference  (on  the  bottom)  is  an 

overlap of the SA spectra recorded simultaneously with SR spectra in conditions (a) to (c).  

The continuous lines (colour on line) superimposed to the SR spectra are fitting lineshapes. 

The signal amplitude in the FM technique depends on the amplitude of the FM modulation; it 

is here chosen to optimize - but not to broaden- the narrower signal (a) : this explains that the 

amplitude  of  the  FM  signal  is  not  notably  larger  in  (b)  and  (c),  in  spite  of  an  increased 

number of atoms.

155°C,  or  ~  3.1014  at/cm3  ;  (b)  T=  180°C,  or  ~  8.1014  at/cm3  ;  (c)  T=  214°C,  or  ~  3.1015

Figure  4  :  Pressure  broadening  (γ)  and  pressure  shift  (Δ)  as  extracted  from  the  SA 

measurements.  The  results  of  the  various  fitting  methods  (square:  fixed  relative  h.f. 

amplitudes;    circle:  independent  h.f.  amplitudes  but  a  single  pressure  effect;  triangle: 

independent amplitudes and pressure effects for each h.f. component),  plotted here for the 

pressure  shift,  exhibit  only  negligible  differences  (the  distribution  of  parameters  for  the 

"independent" h.  f. component is  quite narrow ~ 10% when convergence  can  be  obtained). 

The uncertainty in the pressure scale is on the order of 40 % , corresponding to an absolute 

5°C temperature uncertainty. 

Figure 5 : Comparison of optimally fitting lineshapes for the experimental SA spectrum of

i.e. respectively C3= 65, 69, 73 kHz.µm3,  and γ  = 56, 42, 34 MHz. The fittings here allow 

for  a  frequency  shift  (to  be  attributed  to  a  pressure  shift)  relatively  to  the  SA  reference, 

optimized to a - 14 MHz value for the 3 proposed fittings

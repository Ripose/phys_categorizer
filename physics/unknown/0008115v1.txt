The  operation  and  parameters  of  Bunch  Shape
Monitors  using  coherent  transformation  of  time  structure
of  an  analyzed  beam  into  a  spatial  one  of  low  energy
secondary  electrons  emitted  from  a  wire 
is
influenced  by  the  characteristics  of  a  beam  under  study.
The  electromagnetic  field  of  a  bunch  disturbs 
the
trajectories  of  secondary  electrons,  thus  resulting  in  a
degradation  of  phase  resolution  and  in  errors  of  phase
position reading. Another effect is the perturbation of the
target potential due to the current in the wire induced by a
bunch as well as due to current compensating emission of
the secondary electrons. The methods,  the models and the
results of simulations are presented.

1 INTRODUCTION

The  field  inside  the  chamber  satisfies  the  Poisson

Bunch  Shape  Monitors  (BSM)  are  used  to  measure
longitudinal  microstructure  of  the  accelerated  beam  in  a
number  of  accelerators  [1-4].  The  principle  of  operation
of the BSMs is based on the coherent transformation of a
longitudinal  distribution  of  charge  of  the  analyzed  beam
into  a  spatial  distribution  of  low  energy  secondary
electrons through transverse RF modulation.

the 

Typically the phase resolution of the detectors is about
1(cid:176)  at the frequencies of hundreds MHz. The resolution is
determined  by  a  number  of  parameters.  The  most
complicated  effects  are  due 
influence  of
electromagnetic  fields  of  the  analyzed  beam.  The  fields
disturb  the  trajectories  of  the  electrons  thus  resulting  in
degradation of accuracy of the measurements. This effect
was  estimated  earlier  [5-7]  but  for  extremely  simplified
model  and  detector  geometry.  We  studied  the  effect  for
the  typical  geometry  (fig.1)  of  the  existing  detectors  and
analyzed  the  motion  of  the  electrons  through  the  whole
electron  line  from  target  1  to  the  plane  of  electron
collector 2.

Another  effect  is  the  perturbation  of  the  potential  of
the  target  due  to  the  current  in  the  wire  induced  by  a
bunch as well as due to the current compensating emission
of  the  secondary  electrons.  The  model  of  a  transmission
line is used for estimating the effect.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL

The  motion  of  the  electrons  inside  chamber  3  is
analyzed for the 3D geometry. Downstream of collimator
4 a 2D model is used. Target 1, target holders 5 and the

equation:

Problem 1:          

           (2)

The field 
equation  for 

1E  can be found from a solution of the Laplace
  without  a  beam:

Problem 2:   
        (3)
We assume this process to be a quasi stationary one  and
E <<

.  Formulation  of
equation  and 
this problem is an attempt to take into account the effects
of distortion of the boundary potential. The distortions of
the  target  voltage  are  estimated  below  but  are  not  taken
into account in the simulation process.
Problem  3:  Generally  the  bunch  generates  both  electric
and  magnetic  fields  and  a  complete  system  of  Maxwell
equations  must  be  solved.  To  simplify  the  problem  we
consider  it  to  be  electrostatic  in  the  reference  frame
moving  with  the  bunch.  The  magnetic  field  due  to  the
charges located on the moving boundaries in this frame is
neglected.  With  this  assumptions  for  each  fixed  moment

To estimate the distortion of the potential of the target

it was considered as a transmission line (fig. 2).

The boundary and initial conditions can be the same as
previously with the zero moment of time corresponding to
the middle point between bunches.

The model of a transmission line cannot be considered
as  a  rigorous  one.  We  did  not  use  it  for  problem  2.
However  we  believe  it  to  be  useful  for  estimationg  the
perturbations  of  the  target  voltage  and  for  making  a
conclusion about the applicability of problems 1 and 3.

4 CONCLUSION

The limits of the report do not enable a thorough study
of the effects to be presented. Although each particular set
of  parameters  requires  special  calculations,  nevertheless
some general rules can be mentioned. Thus increasing the
target  potential  evidently  decreases  all  the  space  charge
effects. Although decreasing the transverse dimensions of
the beam increases the space charge forces, nevertheless it
leads  to  the  shrinking  of  the  region  of  the  intensive
interaction of the electrons with the bunch and as a result
decreases  the  influence  of  space  charge.  Decreasing  the
longitudinal  bunch  size  initially  gives  rise  to  the  space
charge  effects.  However  further  decreasing  results  in
decreasing the time of interaction of the electrons with the
bunch  and  hence  in  decreasing  the  final  effects.  The
effects  of  voltage  perturbation  are  essential  for  short
bunches  and 
some  practical  parameters  are
dominating.

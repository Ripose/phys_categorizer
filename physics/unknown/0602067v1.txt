Abstract.  We  calculate  the  change  in  scalar  curvature  inside  a  hollow 

superconducting  sphere.  Metrical  factors  are  first  calculated  when  the  sphere  is 

superconducting.  Metric  equations  are  developed  for  the  evolution  of  a  scalar 

quantum field after the sphere transitions to the normal state.

1. Introduction 

The  classical  Casimir  effect  [1,2]  is,  in  essence,  vacuum  reduction  by  mode 

truncation  where  the  presence  of  conducting  boundaries,  or  capacitor  plates,  excludes 

vacuum modes with wavelengths longer than the separation between the conductors. The 

exclusion  of  longer  wavelengths  results  in  a  lower  vacuum  pressure  between  the  plates 

than in external regions. The resulting pressure difference, or Casimir force, may act to 

push the conductors together, effectively collapsing the reduced vacuum phase. This tiny 

force  has  been  measured  experimentally  [3,4]  in  agreement  with  the  predictions  of 

quantum electrodynamics.  

Boyer gives the first detailed treatment of the vacuum modes inside a conducting 

sphere  [5]  with  more  a  recent  account  by  Milton  [6].  The  Casimir  effect  for  spherical 

conducting  shells  in  external  electromagnetic  fields  has  been  investigated  [7-8]. 

Applications of the Casimir effect to the bag model have been studied for massive scalar 

[9] and Dirac [10] fields confined to the interior of the shell. An example of the Casimir 

effect in curved spacetime has been considered for spherical geometries [11] in de Sitter 

space [12] and in the background of static domain wall [13]. 

In  this  paper  we  calculate  the  variation  in  scalar  curvature  due  to  changes  in 

vacuum pressure established by a spherical conducting boundary. The metrical factors are 

first  calculated  in  the  static  case  when  the  sphere  is  superconducting  and  then  in  the 

dynamical case as the sphere passes to the normal state.

2. The Static Case 

Our  idealized  massless,  thin  sphere  of  radius  R0  has  zero  conductivity  in  the 

normal  state.  In  the  superconducting  state,  the  vacuum  inside  the  hollow  is  reduced  so 

that  there  exists  a  pressure  difference  Δp  inside  and  outside  the  sphere.  In  general,  all 

quantum  fields  will  contribute  to  the  vacuum  energy.  When  the  sphere  of  volume  V 

transitions to the superconducting state, a latent heat of vacuum phase transition ΔpV is 

exchanged. The distribution of vacuum pressure, energy density and space-time geometry 

are described by the semi-classical Einstein field equations taking c = 1,

r∂ .  Note  that  all  time 

derivatives cancel from the field equations when the metric is in standard form and the 

stress energy tensor is diagonal. We first consider the static situation when the sphere is 

in the superconducting state. The energy-momentum conservation equation is 

Since the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is zero and ρ is a scalar, we have

The expression for ρ is given by a divergent mode sum. In calculating the Casimir force, 

one  properly  calculates  differences  in  vacuum  pressure  established  by  the  conducting 

boundaries  [2].  In  the  present  case,  it  is  only  meaningful  to  consider  changes  in  scalar 

curvature due to variations in vacuum pressure. Subtracting the value of R in absence of 

the sphere the renormalized scalar curvature is given by

which depends on the difference in vacuum pressures given by a convergent mode sum. 

 

 

3. The Dynamic Case 

If  the  sphere  passes  from  the  superconducting  to  the  normal  state,  the  pressure 

should equalize as the vacuum relaxes. The diagonal form of the stress energy tensor in 

equation  (2)  results  in  the  cancellation  of  all  time  derivatives  in  the  field  equations. 

External  electromagnetic  fields  will  contribute  off-diagonal  terms,  however  we  wish  to 

consider  how  the  pressure  equalizes  in  absence  of  external  fields.  The  key  is  that  the 

required time dependence is provided by the zero point field fluctuations. It is no longer 

sufficient  to  treat  the  vacuum  as  a  perfect  homogeneous  fluid  in  both  regions.  As  the 

simplest  example,  we  consider  the  massless  scalar  quantum  field 

tr, )φ   with  stress

As before, when evaluating changes in scalar curvature, the expression for R in absence 

of the sphere should be subtracted from that obtained for a given quantum field. Various 

mathematical techniques are available to evaluate the expectation of stress energy terms. 

Extensive  reviews  of  stress  energy  renormalization  techniques  are  given  in  references 

[16, 17]. 

4. Conclusion 

When  calculating  changes  in  metrical  factors  in  regions  with  static  vacuum 

pressure variations, it is sufficient to treat the vacuum as a perfect fluid with 

ρ−=p

. As 

well,  it  is  only  meaningful  to  calculate  changes  in  scalar  curvature  due  to  vacuum 

pressure differences. In the dynamical case, zero-point field fluctuations resulting in off-

diagonal  components  of  the  stress  energy  tensor  give  rise  to  time  dependent  field 

equations.  The  analysis  presented  here  may  be  extended  to  include  massive  fields  with 

coupling or spin (0, ½ and 1) with stress energy tensors given in [16].

CREAM (Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass) is a multi-(cid:3)ight balloon mission designed to collect direct data
on the elemental composition and individual energy spectra of cosmic rays. Two instrument suites have been
built to be (cid:3)own alternately on a yearly base. The tungsten/Sci-Fi imaging calorimeter for the second (cid:3)ight,
scheduled for December 2005, was calibrated with electron and proton beams at CERN. A calibration proce-
dure based on the study of the longitudinal shower pro(cid:2)le is described and preliminary results of the beam test
are presented.

Introduction

CREAM (Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass) is a balloon experiment for direct measurements of cosmic ray
composition and energy spectra, designed to approach the PeV scale in a series of (cid:3)ights taking advantage
of the new Ultra Long Duration Balloon (ULDB) concept under development by NASA. The instrument was
(cid:3)own for the (cid:2)rst time in December 2004 with a conventional LDB balloon from Antarctica. A new (cid:3)ight
duration record of about 42 days was established and about 40 million of science events were collected.
In order to allow for annual (cid:3)ights, two instruments suites (herein called CREAM-1 and CREAM-2) are
planned to be (cid:3)own on alternate years. In this way, the refurbishment operations that follow the recovery of one
payload can take place almost simultaneously with the (cid:3)ight preparation of the second payload. The CREAM-
1 instrument [1, 2, 3] includes a sampling tungsten/scintillating (cid:2)ber calorimeter preceded by a graphite target
with scintillating (cid:2)ber hodoscopes, a pixelated silicon charge detector (SCD), a transition radiation detector
(TRD) and a segmented timing-based particle-charge detector (TCD).
A second (cid:3)ight is scheduled for December 2005 from McMurdo with the CREAM-2 instrument con(cid:2)guration.
The latter does not include the TRD, while the charge identi(cid:2)cation performances of SCD are enhanced by
the addition of a second layer of pixelated silicon sensors. The calorimeter to be (cid:3)own on the second payload
was calibrated with high-energy electrons and protons in the H2 beam line at CERN in September 2004. Its
construction and performance are described in more detail in [4].
In this paper, we report on a method to equalize the response of the 1000 calorimeter cells, based on the study
of the average longitudinal shower development at different electron beam energies.

2. The structure of the CREAM calorimeter

An inelastic interaction of the primary nucleus in the densi(cid:2)ed graphite target ( (cid:7) 0.5 (cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:14)(cid:13) ) initiates a hadronic
shower with a narrow electromagnetic core, generated by the decay of neutral pions, which is imaged by a 20
(radiation length) calorimeter with an active area of 50 (cid:16) 50 cm (cid:17) . The Tungsten/Sci-Fi stack is made of

twenty tungsten plates with interleaved active layers instrumented with 1 cm wide ribbons of 0.5 mm diameter
scintillating (cid:2)bers. The light from each ribbon is fed, via an acrylic light-mixer, into a bundle of clear (cid:2)bers
and then split into 3 sub-bundles, each connected to one pixel of a Hybrid PhotoDiode (HPD). This scheme
allows to divide the calorimeter dynamic range into 3 sub-ranges of different gain, optimized to match the

ends, therefore one calorimeter layer (50 ribbons) is read-out in two half-layers, each comprised of 25 ribbons
and connected to one HPD unit. A total of 2560 channels are read out from 40 photodetectors arranged in 4
crates.

3. Calibration data sets

A (cid:2)rst set of electron data was collected by steering 150 GeV electrons onto the center of each ribbon and
scanning the calorimeter in both views. A second set of electron data at the same energy was taken with a Pb
absorber ( 8 5 X 9 ) in front of the target. The resulting shift in the position of the shower maximum allowed the
calibration of the relative response of the (cid:2)rst layers of the calorimeter. A third data set was taken by rotating

the calorimeter by 180 degrees. In this con(cid:2)guration, the beam impinged on the bottom layer of the calorimeter
and a tungsten absorber of thickness 2 X S was added in front of the beam to compensate both for the absence
of the target (1 X S ) and for the smaller thickness, in terms of g/cm T , of the bottom Al plate with respect to
a standard tungsten plate. Addition of a further 5 X S Pb absorber resulted in a longitudinal distribution with
shower maximum on layer 16, which allowed calibration of the last 4 layers of the calorimeter. Data were
also taken with proton beams of 150, 250, 350 GeV at different angles. Proton data results will be published
separately.

4. Channel equalization and longitudinal pro(cid:2)le deconvolution

Data collected during the horizontal and vertical beam scans, with 150 GeV electrons, were studied to equalize
the calorimeter at channel level. A two steps procedure was implemented.
First, the response of each ribbon connected to a same HPD (averaged over about 5000 events) was obtained.
Then, each group of 25 ribbon signals was equalized to the average response of the respective half-layer (herein
referred to as (cid:147)average HPD signal(cid:148)). Since the gain uniformity of the HPD pixels is known to be at the level of
a few U
(for an example, see Fig.1) is expected to have contributions from
the accuracy in the calorimeter construction (including individual light yield and optical coupling ef(cid:2)ciency of
the ribbons), but also from systematic errors on the beam position accuracy during the scan.

, an observed variance of order VXWYU

The second step of the procedure consisted in equalizing the 40 HPDs average signals. This was needed in order
to take in account the differences in quantum ef(cid:2)ciency (QE) and optical coupling among the photodetectors.
This correction is not straightforward because the scintillation light collected by each HPD is a function of its
depth in the Tungsten/Sci-Fi stack at a given energy. Therefore, the HPDs average responses have to be (cid:2)rst
corrected for the dependence on the longitudinal shower pro(cid:2)le. This (cid:147)deconvolution method(cid:148) was applied
only at a one beam energy (150 GeV) where, by comparing the longitudinal shower pro(cid:2)le obtained with the
40 HPDs average signals with the one predicted by a Monte Carlo simulation (based on the Fluka 2003.1b
package [6]), a set of 40 energy independent constants, one per HPD, was extracted. The same procedure was
repeated with data sets taken at different energies, as a consistency check of the energy independence of the
HPD constants.

As a result of the two step procedure, 1000 calibration constants (one per ribbon) were determined, using
exclusively the 150 GeV electron data. Application of the calibration constants to the data taken at different

beam energies resulted in average longitudinal pro(cid:2)les as in Fig.2, where the solid line is the MonteCarlo
prediction. The data points were found to be consistent with the simulation.

5. Energy calibration

During the energy scan, the calorimeter was kept at (cid:2)xed position, with the beam impinging on the centre at
normal incidence. The calorimetric energy was calculated from the sum of the 3 ribbons centered on the beam,
as shown in Fig.3 for the four different beam energies. This procedure removes the contribution of the noise
due to the calorimeter cells far away from the shower envelope and reproduces the effect of the sparsi(cid:2)cation
threshold, which is applied to the calorimeter data during the (cid:3)ight in order to reduce the overall size of the
event. The calorimeter response to electron energy up to 200 GeV is shown in Fig.4(left) where the intercept

The dependence of the calorimetric measurement with the applied voltage (HV) of the photodectors has been
studied separately, by taking data at different HV values in the range 6 to 10.5 KV at a (cid:2)xed beam energy. The
calorimeter response was found to be linear in the above range of HV values and the high voltage scan has been
repeated at different beam energies. The energy resolution dependence on the HV gain of the HPD is shown in
Fig.4(right) for electrons at a beam energy of 150 GeV (upper curve) and 200 GeV (lower curve).

support of CERN for the beam test facilities and operations.

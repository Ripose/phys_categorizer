Abstract. Comparing observed and theoretical potential energy curves for natural and exotic neutral 4-unit charge 
Coulomb systems like HH and HantiH leads to new conclusions on the effect of charge-antisymmetry in nature. 
With singularities in the HantiH PEC as found by Aldrovandi and Puget and by Junker and Bardsley, any cusp in the 
HantiH PEC significantly affects the annihilation cross section. This problem for the HantiH interaction generated 
many new wave mechanical calculations mainly to remove annoying cusps. We review all available PECs for 4-unit 
charge systems and find that corrections for the Morgan-Hughes HantiH PEC can either go to the repulsive side (to 
the conventionally expected annihilation channel) or to the opposite attractive side (to the attractive branch of the 
observed PEC of natural molecular H2). We observe that all theoretical HantiH PECs published thus far would 
intersect the observed PEC of natural H2. This is, however, impossible with the non-crossing rule. A classical ab initio 
calculation of the electrostatic perturbation brings the HantiH PEC much closer to the observed H2 PEC than to the 
PEC of the annihilative channel. This new unprecedented result for long-range behavior in 4-unit charge Coulomb systems 
confirms that natural antiH must exist and that molecule H2 must be interpreted as HantiH. In fact, this seems to be 
the only solution left, if PECs for systems HH and HantiH with the same symmetry cannot cross.

Introduction 
 
Understanding the stability of neutral 4 unit charge systems like prototype molecule H2 
 
has a long history, going back to the 19th century [1]. Heitler and London found the first wave 
mechanical solution for H2 or HH [2] but we found evidence that molecule H2 be denoted as HH  
[1]. This conclusion is based on observed short-range oscillator behavior in the PEC (potential 
energy curve) of natural H2, which obeys the Kratzer potential around the minimum [1]. Yet, we 
need also a first principles explanation for long-range behavior near the asymptote [1] and must 
therefore prove that long-range behavior of H2 is also consistent with the same charge-anti-
symmetrical Hamiltonian of [1a]. To do so, we review all earlier wave mechanical calculations on 
HH [3], since we argued [1a] that the HH PEC was still uncertain, despite intensive work.  

It has been conjectured for long that exotic 4-particle system HH, where neutral matter H 

interacts with neutral antimatter H, must annihilate. Recent claims on the mass production of 
artificial H [4] boosted theoretical studies on the HH PEC [3]. Yet there remains an uncertainty 
about the shape of the HH PEC as argued in [1]: exotic HH is expected to be unstable because of 
annihilation [3] but line and band spectra indicate that HH is stable instead [1]. We focus on this 
important controversy, since the work of Kolos et al. on HH [3a] and all more recent HH-studies 
[3b,c] were started mainly after singularities (energy extremes) were found earlier in the HH PEC 
[5-6]. With singularities, the expected annihilation of HH and its cross section is greatly affected 
[3,5-6]. About 30 years ago, the issue of extremes was important in the debate on the best shape 
of the HH PEC. Kolos et al. [3a] admitted the existence of a cusp but argued its height was far 
less than calculated earlier [5-6]. Since extremes in a HH PEC have far reaching consequences [5], 
not the least for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe [7], we review published HH 
PECs to find out what is at the roots of this dispute. Inventorying all PECs for neutral 4-unit 
charge Coulomb systems is an important classical exercise [1a] to understand these systems1. 
 
Today, the singularity problem in theoretical HH PECs seems solved satisfactorily, since it is 
believed generally that the HH attraction is continuous (without extremes) [3] so as to end finally in 
the expected annihilation of exotic bond HH. The implicit reason for this expectation is a persistent 
belief that, at short range, exotic HH smoothly rearranges in 2 neutral sub-systems positronium Ps and 
protonium Pn, which lead to annihilation [3,9]. This expectation seems plausible, since the 2 charge-
conjugated and mass-symmetrical neutral 2-unit charge systems Ps and Pn will annihilate according to 
Dirac theory [1a]. But the perfect charge-symmetry in both Ps and Pn, needed for their 
annihilation to be possible is, in reality, broken by the large mass difference between lepton and 
baryon in H and H [10], both present in neutral 4 particle Coulomb aggregate HH. With a PEC 
                                                 
1 some consequences of the existence of natural H [1] for the mass production of artificial H [4] are in [8]

representation, this is easily accounted for by assigning a different asymptote to Ps+Pn and H+H 
channels at large inter-baryon separation (see Fig. 4 in [3a] and further below). But at short range, all 
calculations assume –without explicit proof- that the PECs for the charge-symmetrical channel Ps,Pn and 
for charge-anti-symmetrical channel H,H will have to get close together, in line with the expectation of the 
annihilation of the HH system. Therefore, we must find out exactly what happens at intermediate 
range, where the curves for the two systems are getting closer, will or will not cross and where 
the chances for singularities to occur are real [5-6]. Whether or not HH PEC calculations are 
biased mainly by the expectation of annihilation is dealt with below, as, unfortunately, bias is not 
unusual in physics [11]. Quantum chemistry has proved unreliable in many instances too [12] as 
also argued in [1].  

Theoretically probing singularities for exotic particle systems, not yet observed experimentally, is 

severely biased indeed. Since for a 4-unit charge system there is no disagreement at all on the 10 
terms in the two Hamiltonians, the problem reduces to a number of arbitrary or subjective 
choices for the wave functions needed to solve the wave equation [1a]. First, there is the radial 
dependency of atomic wave functions STO and GTO. Their ability to deal with cusp conditions is 
critical as is their usefulness and reliability at long, intermediate and short range. Due to their 
analytical difference, STOs in general lead to a better convergence than GTOs, which do not give 
the correct lepton behavior near the nucleus. GTOs cannot satisfy cusp conditions and only 
additional terms can correct for wrong short-range behavior. For H-containing systems HH and 
HH, STOs seem the best and natural choice since they resemble the exact functions of H. Unlike 
GTOs, STOs exhibit the correct cusp behavior at short range, whereas GTOs are known to fall 
off too rapidly at long range. More terms are needed to achieve the same accuracy with GTOs 
than with STOs. But GTOs are nevertheless preferred over STOs because of reduced computing 
times, not the most objective argument in terms of theory. Recent work on the HH-system uses GTOs in 
the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation and predicts a very smooth HH PEC without any 
singularity [3c]. With charge-inversion, the nucleon-nucleon interaction changes suddenly from 
repulsive to attractive, creating an enormous Coulomb gap of |2e2/rAB| between the 2 mutually 
exclusive charge-conjugated states, charge-symmetrical HH or HH and charge-anti-symmetrical HH or HH [1]. 
We try to cover most of these aspects in the analysis below after reporting extensively on the 
actual status of all published theoretical HH PECs. 
 
Inventory of theoretical HH PECs 
We collected all data on HH PECs from the original publications, published during the 
 
last decades, except those on the important HH PEC of Aldrovandi and Puget [5], for which no 
data were tabulated. From Fig. 6 in [5] and their discussion, we know they found a minimum at 2,8 
a.u. below asymptote –1 and a maximum at 1,8 a.u. above this asymptote of +0,8 eV.  
 
HH PECs is illustrated in Fig. 1, where, as expected with annihilative HH, no singularity seems to 
occur at first sight. It is evident from Fig. 1 that the results of the primary HH PEC of Morgan 
and Hughes [9] (called δ in their paper) diverge markedly from those of Kolos et al. [3a], which, 
in turn, is almost indiscernible from the recent HH PECs of Labzowsky et al. [3b] and of 
Strasburger [3c]. A remarkable conclusion from Fig. 1 is that for Morgan and Hughes the HH 
interaction is much more attractive at all ranges considered than for all others. For instance, at R = 1,5 
a.u., the difference between the 2 main PECs in Fig. 1 is ~30000 cm-1, much too large2 to be 
neglected, and which must be discussed properly. 
 
In the global E, R view of Fig. 1, differences between HH PECs JB [6], KMSW [3a], 
LSPPS [3b], similar to S [3c], are hardly visible. One would be tempted to conclude from all these 
theoretical HH PECs, except for the Morgan-Hughes PEC also in Fig. 1, that the HH attraction is 
indeed well understood, since most of them converge towards the theoretically expected annihilation 
of neutral H and H, along the lines of the annihilation of the Ps+Pn channel (see Fig. 4 of [3a]). 
The only diverging theoretical HH PEC [9] is important enough to be examined more closely. In 

With the exception of this unique HH PEC with its 2 extremes [5], the shape of all theoretical 

                                                 
2 e.g. too large in comparison with the total well depth of the HH system at 0,74 Å of about 38200 cm-1 (see below)

fact, Morgan and Hughes [9] took great care in obtaining a HH PEC just from the electrostatic 
perturbing part of the total Hamiltonian, an effort to be dealt with below.

Fig. 2 Singularities in theoretical HH PECs 

Apart from the 2 extremes in the Aldrovandi-Puget HH PEC [5], Fig. 2 gives the details

of the cusp below the asymptote found by Junker and Bardsley [6]. We adapted the scales to 
illustrate the JB-barrier around 3r0 (~1.5 Å) in comparison with other theoretical PECs, where this 
extreme is much smaller [3a] (for similar figures, see Fig. 1 in [6] and Fig. 1 in [3a]).  
 
Both are constructed with data, published by a variety of scientists working on the theoretically 
expected PEC for so-called exotic 4-unit charge Coulomb system HH. They set out the further 
contours for our analysis. With Fig. 2, it is impossible to conclude like in [3c], that the HH 

Fig. 1 and 2 illustrate part of the difficulties with theoretical HH PECs, mentioned in [1a].

interaction is already relatively well known and that the HH PEC has been established for over 20 years 
[3c]. On the contrary, Fig. 2 shows that, in reality, theoretical HH PECs diverge markedly at all 
ranges of interest: long, intermediate as well as short. The differences are not small but huge (see also 
footnote 1 and Appendix), which does not simplify the situation, since, in addition, the 
experimental HH PEC has not yet been measured (but see below). In the absence of this PEC, a 
discussion of the relative merits and precision of all above theoretical HH PECs is academic. 
One conclusion is certain: some HH calculations will have to be revised since they cannot all be 
correct at the same time. The problem is now to find out which is (are) wrong and why. 
 
Crossing of theoretical HH PECs with the only observed PEC for a stable 4-unit charge Coulomb system 
 
 
Obviously, the absolute reference PEC missing in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 is the PEC of the only 
natural, neutral and stable 4-unit charge system H2, known with sufficient spectroscopic accuracy 
for many a decade [13]. It is therefore of ultimate interest to compare the theoretical PEC of the 
so-called exotic HH system with that of HH or H2, since the two are both neutral 4-unit charge 
Coulomb systems with the same symmetry. This exercise, never done properly when it was most 
needed, it is not without interest [1a]. In fact, the remarkable result of bringing all PECs together 
is shown in Fig. 3.

Fig. 3 Theoretical HH PECs and the observed PEC of H2 
(full line observed H2 PEC [13], short dashes Morgan-Hughes HH PEC [9], mixed dashes HH PEC Kolos et al. [3a] 
 
It is strange that the observed H2 PC in Fig. 3, published in 1963 [13], was theoretically 
 
reproduced with great accuracy by Kolos and Wolniewicz in 1965 [14] (see also Appendix) and that 
the authors’ great experience with the H2 PEC was used to calculate, together with Morgan and 
Schrader [3a], the theoretical HH PEC, also shown in Fig. 3. It is now evident that a primary 
objective of [3,9] must have been to remove the unwanted singularities detected in earlier HH 
PECs (see Fig. 2) in order to make sure that the expected annihilation of HH would indeed proceed as 
generally believed. 
 
belief that HH will annihilate. Since, in wave mechanics, HH and HH have the same symmetry, their PECs are 
not allowed to cross. This definitely settles our point in [1] on the so-called annihilation of system HH, which is 
proved at least doubtful, if not impossible, with Fig. 3.  
 
It is therefore difficult to understand why all theorists did their very best to shift the 
primary Morgan-Hughes HH or δ PEC in Fig. 1 and 2 to the left (to the more repulsive side) where it 
would be closer to the PEC of the annihilative channel Ps+Pn, if they had known the position of 
this function with respect to the H2 PEC (see Fig. 3). Even Morgan and Hughes [9] had no less 

The most important and imminent conclusion from Fig. 3 is that it simply contradicts the conventional

Since in [1a] we concentrated on the minimum of the H2 PEC, we now easily verify with 

than 3 suggestions to shift their own primary δ-function to the left with the adapted functions 
(PECs), they called α, β and γ (see Fig. 2 in [9]). For reasons not easily understood, no one ever 
tried to shift this same Morgan-Hughes δ PEC to the right (to the more attractive side), where it 
would have come close to the attractive branch of the observed H2 PEC, a plausible possibility 
when looking at Fig. 3 and the crossing problem therein. These theoretical HH PECs, published a 
long time ago, were in fact one of the main reasons for our fundamental dissatisfaction with wave 
mechanical procedures [1,12] and with their reliability and predictive power for not yet observed systems 
[1a] (see below). Using Fig. 3, it is obvious that these calculations, all giving rather smooth HH 
PECs, intentionally corrected the perturbing Coulomb terms of the Morgan-Hughes δ-function for HH towards 
the annihilative channel at the left, whereas the observed attractive branch of the H2 PEC was the 
only known and more reliable reference channel for correcting this same HH function to the right [1] with 
the prospect of avoiding crossings. 
 
Fig. 3 that, at the minimum of H2, all theoretical HH PECs, without exception, would have to 
cross the observed H2 PEC. This evident possibility is the more remarkable since anyone could have 
constructed Fig. 3 many decades ago, all data being available in the 1970s. If this exercise had been done in due 
time [1a], one would have been confronted at a very early stage with the same surprising situation: the crossing of 
theoretical annihilative HH PECs with the observed HH PEC at the minimum and with all of the drastic 
consequences thereof. In any case, Fig. 3 clearly reveals that something very fundamental may 
have been overlooked indeed in all efforts above to predict a theoretical PEC for 4-unit charge 
Coulomb system HH [1a]. For if the theoretical HH PECs in Fig. 3 were really reliable as claimed 
by the authors, the non-crossing rule would secure that, at the crossing point, all annihilative HH 
PECs would invariantly go over in the repulsive, non-annihilative branch of the observed HH or H2 
PEC. Similarly, the non-crossing rule would secure that the observed non-annihilative H2 PEC 
would go over in the annihilative HH PEC, which is impossible as H2 is stable. Since of all PECs 
in Fig. 3 only the observed HH or H2 PEC is really reliable, the non-crossing rule provides with an 
almost absolute criterion for shifting all of the theoretical HH PECs to the right, the only 
direction possible to coincide with the attractive branch of HH or H2 like we argued in [1]. 
 
To solve this problem, we must be able to account for long-range behavior in 4-unit 
charge systems using the same Hamiltonian approach of [1a]. Oscillator behavior around the 
minimum in the H2 PEC in Fig. 3 is sufficiently understood with the Kratzer potential hidden in 
the 10-term attractive Hamiltonian [1a]. At long range, oscillator behavior smoothly transforms in 
non-oscillator behavior, a transition left unaccounted for in [1a] (see the left part of Fig. 4b in 
[1a]). To remedy for non-oscillator behavior with an ab initio treatment, we are obliged to test this 
very same bound state Hamiltonian, with its built-in Kratzer potential at short range [1a], for its 
prediction at long-range for 4-unit charge Coulomb systems. Looking at Fig. 3, this is indeed a 
crucial and critical problem for all 4-unit charge PECs reviewed here. 
 
Long range behavior of charge-symmetrical and charge-anti-symmetrical 4-unit charge systems and their PECs 
 
 
Natural HH and its symmetrical exotic counterpart HH obey identical Hamiltonians, since 
a double intra-atomic charge inversion leaves the total 10-term Hamiltonian invariant [1a,3a]. The 
single charge-inversion needed for charge-antisymmetric aggregates HH or HH alters the sign of 
the 4 inter-atomic Coulomb terms in their Hamiltonians, which makes these charge-antisymmetric 
(charge-conjugated) too without interference of lepton or baryon spin. With [1], the combined 4-unit 
charge algebraic Hamiltonians 
H±= H0±∆H   
 
are, by definition, mutually exclusive since they are (charge-)conjugated, despite the neutrality of all 4-
unit charge Coulomb species involved [1a].

regarded as absolutely valid, pending the geometric 4-unit charge model. In the adiabatic Born-

3 Using geometric models (leading to form factors) is the classical equivalent of using wave functions

With Hamiltonians (1), the next problem is to find out how the very same 4-particle 

Oppenheimer approximation of wave mechanics, a few uncertainties and arbitrary criteria are 
introduced. The first uncertainty must reside in the wave functions used for solving the wave 
equation [1] as remarked in the Introduction (see Appendix for more details). In [1a], we argued 
that putting the value of the wave equation equal to +1 in whatever region concerned focuses the 
attention to the algebra in total Hamiltonian (1) and, especially at longer range, to the electrostatic 
perturbing terms in ±∆H. As in [1], we use classical geometrical models to mimic the effect of 
wave functions in order to conserve the transparency required for a classical discussion of the 
four perturbing Coulomb terms in (1).  
 
Hamiltonian for the bound state, which hides a Kratzer potential at the minimum [1], can also 
come to the rescue at longer range (attractive branch of the PEC) for the very same system when 
the Kratzer potential is no longer obeyed [1]. 
 
the right of the Morgan-Hughes HH PEC in Fig. 1-3 has ab initio status before it can become 
competitive with the conventional shift to the left. As stated above, Morgan and Hughes spent 
much time on the perturbing terms in the HH Hamiltonian and wrote: ‘However, for all values 
of (the inter-baryon separation) rAB, it is probable that V (HH interaction energy) is negative. For 
rAB>r0 (Bohr radius), V is roughly the negative of V for the corresponding atom-atom pair’ [9]. These 
statements are of ab initio status, since they are a direct consequence of the conjugation in (1) [1a]. 
For relatively simple 4-unit charge Coulomb hydrogenic systems of comparable complexity like 
HH and HH, Fig. 1-3 prove that wave mechanical calculations do not agree [1a]. 
 
unit charge Hamiltonian itself says about the HH interaction for a given configuration. This 
procedure is particularly suited, given the efforts by Morgan-Hughes on the four perturbing 
terms in a wave mechanical procedure without a specific model [9].  

Using the approximation +1 for the wave function [1a], it is simple to verify what the 4-

In addition, to avoid ambiguity and bias, we must secure that the evidence for a shift to 

We first scale (1) with the Hartree |e2/r0| (r0 = 1 a.u.) and filter out the (charge-) 

conjugated perturbing terms [1b], which gives 

 

 

 

±∆H/(|e2/r0|) = ± r0 (-1/rAb - 1/rBa  + 1/rab + 1/rAB)  

To solve electrostatic problem (2), we use a configuration, where particle rearrangements are 

(2) 
where subscripts a and b refer to the leptons, A and B to the baryons [1a]. The + solution of (2) 
gives the HL-perturbation for charge-symmetrical H2 (atom-atom system), the – solution applies for 
the charge-anti-symmetrical perturbation in HH (atom-anti-atom system) both in the ground Σ-state 
(spin must not be considered [1a,3a]). 
 
not allowed to preserve transparency. To keep the system dynamic also, we use Bohr-like molecular 
models [15]. The leptons are both in orbit in planes perpendicular to the inter-baryon separation 
rAB and each of them describes a circular motion with radius r0, the Bohr length. Despite its 
simplicity, this model without polarization [1b] allows calculations of ab initio or first principles’ 
status with the added advantage to discuss deviations from the model with classical physics. Revival 
in the interest for Bohr’s molecular models proves their efficacy [16] and confirms the efficiency, 
reliability and transparency of old quantum theory in comparison with wave mechanics [1].  
 
With this Bohr-model, atom-atom case HH gives parallel dipoles or ↑······(rAB)······↑, if 
lepton motion is synchronous and without phase-shift [1b,17]. Similarly, atom-anti-atom case 
HH uses anti-parallel dipoles ↑·····(rAB)······↓ with the same constraints for lepton motion (other 
cases are discussed elsewhere [17]).

This is an equation with model-dependent ab initio status and provides with the transparency 
missing in wave mechanical procedures [1a]. We remark that Morgan and Hughes solved 
perturbation (2) with wave functions tested for good behavior with solving the wave equation for 
HH [9]. This is a typical case where wave mechanics looses the transparency of classical physics.  

For large m, dipole-dipole interaction (6) simplifies to repulsive +1/m3 for HH and to 

attractive –1/m3 for its conjugated or charge-anti-symmetrical counterpart HH [1b]. For obvious 
reasons, we will not plot +1/m3+… for the repulsive interaction in charge-symmetrical HH, since 
repulsion can never lead to annihilation [1] and since +1/m3 is the conjugate of attractive –1/m3 
for HH, which we will use below. Of course, at very long range (very large m), it is difficult to 
assume that the 2 main classical constraints (synchronism of phase-less lepton motion) are 
applicable. Attenuation of the underlying pure Coulomb interactions in (6) will have to be 
introduced to accommodate for less ordered states (e.g. asynchronous motion with phase-shifts) 
with statistical correction factors, say of exponential type [17], with dispersion forces4, 
polarization effects…). Most of these, as well as similar effects are discussed in [17].

First, we compare the magnitudes of the shifts to the repulsive left, implicit in the HH 

 
 
PEC of Strasburger [3c] and to the attractive right, based on (6). With the Morgan-Hughes PEC 
as reference, the theoretical right-shift with (6) is less drastic than the left-shift suggested in [3c] as 
illustrated in Fig. 4. We are confident in the theoretical reliability of (6), since Morgan and Hughes 
devoted so much attention [9] to perturbation (2). 
 
have plotted the attractive –solution of (6) also in Fig. 5 to show how the long range PEC 
deriving from (6) behaves in comparison with the PECs in Fig. 3. The classical interaction energy 
for HH with (6) shifts the Morgan-Hughes PEC indeed to the right, i.e. to the more attractive 
domain, instead of to the left in the annihilative model. We must now decide which shift is the 
better to remove the wrong behavior of the primary Morgan-Hughes HH or δ PEC in Fig. 3 and to 
avoid the (not allowed) crossing of the HH and HH PECs. The conventional shift to the left is

clearly biased by the universal expectation of HH annihilation (rearrangement to Ps+Pn in an 
annihilative channel). On the contrary, a theoretically validated shift to the right, due to (6), brings the 
right-corrected HH PEC close to the attractive branch of the observed H2 PEC. This seems a 
strange result but it is nevertheless also the transparent result of a classical ab initio calculation (6), 
the validity of which cannot be denied despite its 2 straightforward constraints on lepton motion.

It is now likely that all expectations on the annihilation of HH will have to be reviewed. 

 
 
One can simply verify de visu that of all theoretical HH PECs collected above, only long range 
attraction obeying (6), i.e. the long range HH PEC with our model, is closer to the attractive 
branch of the observed PEC of H2 and would be capable to avoid the crossing problem in Fig. 3. 
This is another unprecedented result, adding to those reported earlier on the PEC of a bound 4-
unit charge system around the minimum [1]. More details on the effects of antisymmetry are in [17]. 
 
HH with (6) is 
 
 
and is expected to be valid at long range, near the dissociation threshold. The corresponding 
PEC is also given in Fig. 5. However, the simple linear relation between (7) and observed long-
range behavior of H2 reported in [1b] opens the way for natural H-H oscillations. Seen in 
retrospect, it is remarkable that theoretical work on the HH PEC was intensified with the 
appearance of the small cusp in Fig. 2 but that the large cusp in Fig. 3 was not considered when 
trying to construct a PEC for neutral 4-unit charge Coulomb systems like HH and HH. 
 
With Fig. 5 and Fig. 4a in [1a], we managed to understand satisfactorily the complete H2 
PEC using the so-called wrong Hamiltonian, believed to apply only for exotic system HH. This is 
likely to remain an extraordinary result for Physics/Einstein Year 2005 [1a]. In short, (i) molecule 
hydrogen H2 should be understood with charge-anti-symmetrical HH rather than with charge-
symmetrical HH and (ii) matter (H) does not annihilate when it meets antimatter (H). Instead, when 
brought together, they form a very stable molecule H2 [1].  
 
Conclusion 
A direct confrontation of all (theoretical and observed) PECs for neutral 4-unit charge 
 
systems reveals that theorists may well have been wrong footed by nature on how the interpret 
molecular hydrogen H2. The predictive power of wave mechanics is indeed overestimated for not 
yet observed systems, where its predictions should be regarded with great caution [1a]. In fine,

Despite conviction, H2 is a stable non-annihilating matter-antimatter aggregate HH and it 

Fig. 3 provides with a serious test for the reliability and transparency of wave mechanics in 
comparison with (Bohr’s) old quantum theory [1a,16].  
 
will require some courage indeed to admit that something very elementarily went wrong very 
early [1]. In fact, a straightforward way out of this dilemma with crossing in Fig. 3 is to abandon 
the idea that H and H will annihilate. If confirmed, experimental physicists and chemists can, 
fortunately, carry on as usual with observing PECs but for theorists, the situation is completely 
different. Finally, the so-called matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe [5,7] is no longer a 
problem for classical stochiometric reasons [1b].

Appendix 
Uncertainties, arbitrary criteria and bias to solve the wave equation for 4-unit charge system HH 
 

With (1), the lepton interaction for charge-symmetrical systems HH and HH is repulsive +e2/rab (Coulomb 

Unlike the HL treatment of H2 [2], it soon appeared that, in order to solve the wave equation for HH, the 

(i) First arbitrary criterion: lepton and nucleon separations 
 
variables had to be adapted, e.g. that the inter-lepton separation rab was also required. Although it appears only in the 
perturbing parts ∆H of total Hamiltonians (1), lepton separation rab is indeed needed, following the Hylleraas 
solution for neutral three unit charge system He [19] and the James-Coolidge solution for neutral four unit charge 
system H2 [20]. Since electron correlation was taken into account, this last solution for H2 was significantly better 
than original Heitler and London theory [2]. But the introduction of rab necessitated the use of more complicated 
wave functions, adapted for this famous Coulomb problem +e2/rab. This increasing complexity brings in a first 
arbitrary criterion to decide on the goodness of a wave function. This goodness is usually only established a posteriori, 
i.e. after a calculation due to the mediocre transparency of wave mechanical procedures for many particle systems. 
 
problem) but for charge-anti-symmetrical HH or HH this perturbing term becomes attractive -e2/rab. This would remove 
the (lepton) Coulomb problem at once, if it ever existed [1a]. Whether or not a singularity occurs in the PEC for HH 
is closely related with the analytical treatment of this famous Coulomb term for HH or H2. A similar conjugation 
also applies to the inter-baryon interaction, which is repulsive +e2/rAB for charge-symmetrical systems but attractive –
e2/rAB for charge-anti-symmetrical systems. This huge charge-based parity effect has a tremendous impact on the adiabatic 
Born-Oppenheimer approximation in the first place. 
(ii) Second arbitrary criterion: pathological behavior and the prospect of annihilation 
 
pathological behavior [21], whereby parts of the PEC do not behave properly or as expected, a second arbitrary, if not 
subjective, criterion to judge on a given function. In short, one expects some kind of PEC from the start and, therefore, one will 
intuitively select only these functions, which will obey these (subjective) expectations. As pointed out earlier, this is the reason why 
the challenge for the reliability of wave mechanics is to predict exactly, and theoretically from first principles only, the real PEC 
for an exotic particle system, for which the experimental PEC is not yet available [1a]. Forms of pathological behavior are not 
restricted to theoretical PECs for exotic systems. In fact, they are a real bias for quantum chemical calculations at large 
[12], in agreement with our earlier assessment [1a]. 
 
The annihilation criterion is the main cause why the original and very elaborate M-H treatment [9] of the 
perturbing terms in (1) was abandoned and why, in the end, the M-H PEC for HH in Fig. 1 had to be shifted to the 
more repulsive side (see Fig. 3). Only in this way, the PEC could get closer to the annihilation of the Ps+Pn channel, 
which is believed –without absolute proof given- to be the best channel also for the expected annihilation of HH.  
(iii) Third arbitrary criterion: STO versus GTO, parameterization 
 
properly behaving wave function. Here, the choice between STOs and GTOs is very important for the reasons given in the 
Introduction. Differences between the STO treatment of Kolos et al. [3a] and the GTO analysis of Strasburger [3c], 
both believed to be very accurate, are illustrated in Fig. 6. It is evident that something must be wrong even here, although 
the scales used in conventional Fig. 1 prevent the exposure of these discrepancies.  
 

In addition, it is known for long in a variety of disciplines that PEC-generating functions can easily result in 

After changing the variables to remedy for the Coulomb problem, another difficult problem is to select a

It now is easier to understand a variety of remarks by authors, when speaking of a number of criteria in order 

reference point. Reminding that the H2 PEC, calculated by Kolos and Wolniewicz [14] is claimed accurate far below 
the 1 cm-1 level (or far below µHartree), the differences between the 2 theoretical HH PECs are huge. In addition, 
the authors themselves warn about the relative accuracy of their PECs. Kolos et al. [3a] say that the accuracy of their 
HH PEC deteriorates quickly with decreasing rAB. At rAB =3, the interaction energy converges to 6 significant figures 
but at shorter separation, no more than 4 figures are reliable. Even then, the uncertainty with Fig. 6 remains: it is simply 
impossible to decide which of the 2 functions is the better. One can only wonder why the H2 PEC of Kolos and 
Wolniewicz [14] converges to 7 or 8 significant figures (nanoHartree) and their HH PEC to only 6 or even 4, when 
HH and HH are 2 very similar systems in terms of complexity, as remarked in [1a]. 
(iv) Arbitary procedures: a few explicit examples 
 
to secure proper behavior of the HH PEC, generated with the aid of particular wave functions.  
(a) For Kolos et al. [3a] there are problems for different regions of rAB. “One set of 42 additional functions was used 
for rAB ≥ 3 a.u. and another for rAB< 3 a.u.”. This is exactly the region where also the accuracy of the HH PEC is 
greatly affected (see foregoing paragraph). 
(b) Armour, Carr and Zeman [22] even introduce an extra function Ψps to represent virtual positronium. This function 
depends on rab, with a variational parameter κ as well as a shielding function g(ρ) to ensure good behavior of Ψps at ρ=0. 
For this shielding function, depending on (1-e-γρ)n, to be workable, they write: “After some numerical trials, n was 
taken to be 3 and γ to be 0,5” … without any further explanation. They confirm that the HH interaction is smooth 
and without singularity but restrict their HH calculations to very short range (≤1). This is a range of less interest, 
where large errors are unavoidable (see the slopes in Fig. 1-3) and where energies exceed the total energy of H2. 
(c) Campeanu and Beu [23] say that the cusp in the Junker-Bardsley PEC (see Fig. 2) is spurious and that the PEC of 
Kolos et al. [3a] is better.  
(d) Strasburger [3c] admits that there are 2 interesting questions with H-H in the BOA. The first is, as usual, the 
existence of a barrier in the interaction (see Fig. 2). He writes: “It is not easy to state definitely the shape of the PEC 
in the system, where both atom and anti-atom are neutral” (sic)…and continues with “The problem (of the barrier) 
was solved in the paper of Kolos et al.[3a] – the interaction appeared to be monotonic and attractive in the whole 
range of rAB”. His second question is related to the binding of light particles by baryonic matter… and he uses 
arguments provided by the strange procedure in [22], mentioned under (b) and is also mainly interested in providing 
more accurate values at short range (see Fig. 6). This concern with short range behavior is, again, an example of how 
bias due to the annihilative Ps+Pn channel enters the scene. 
 
used for selecting so-called well-performing or well-behaving wave functions [1a]. It appears we are indeed entitled to use this 
qualification, since the criteria in use are always governed by the conventional bias of how the HH PEC should look 
like intuitively or behave properly (non pathological), i.e. it should behave just like the annihilating Ps+Pn channel at short 
range.  
 

These examples illustrate what we meant by saying that …in some of the works on HH, rather subjective criteria are

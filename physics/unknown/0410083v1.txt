Dust particles are ubiquitous in space, including e.g. diffuse and dense interstellar media (ISM), nova 
ejecta, the outflow of red giant stars and accretion disks, proto-planetary nebula etc. The identification of solid 
hydrogenated carbonaceous material in the diffuse ISM has been confirmed by infrared (IR) observations and 
has been studied in laboratory [1].  

An  important  tool  for  the  interpretation  of  astronomical  IR  data  and  the  understanding  of  the 
observed  phenomena  is  the  availability  of  IR  spectra  gained  from  laboratory  investigations  on  analogue 
materials.  Plasma polymerization of hydrocarbons (e.g. argon diluted acetylene) is an efficient source for dust 
formation in laboratory.  The resulting IR spectra reveal the aliphatic CH stretch at 3.4 µm as well as traces of 
aromatic compounds and a weak OH and carbonyl presence [2].  A comparison of the 3.4 µm band profiles of 
the  nanoparticles  bands  wit  those  that  originate  from  circumstellar  material  [2,  3,  4]  reveals  striking 
similarities.  Furthermore, these experimental IR fingerprints are also similar to the 2 – 10 µm spectra of dust 
in the diffuse ISM, e.g. IR spectra of dust as seen towards luminous background sources such as the Galactic 
Center  [1,  2,  3,  5].    Our  polymerization  method  enables  us  to  vary,  in  a  simple  and  controlled  way,  the 
physical and chemical parameters important for particle and chemical formation.  In the case of the particles 
grown  with  nitrogen  as  a  carrier  gas,  the  spectra  show  strong  dominance  of  nitrogen  bonds  over  pure 
hydrocarbon bonds, producing a band at 4.62 µm, which has been identified in dense cold dust [6, 7].  Plasma 
induced growth of dust also allows investigation of different in-situ measurements on the collective effects of 
the dust (e.g. charging processes) and on the growth dynamics.

In  the  framework  of  the  solvable  model  of  cosmology  constructed  in  the  Earth-related
coordinate  system,  we  modify  the  Hubble  law.  A  time-varying  Hubble  parameter
emerges.  It  then  leads  to  the  observed  cosmic  acceleration  and  eliminates  the  need  of
dark emerge.

A  problem,  called  the  “missing  mass”  problem  or  dark  energy  problem,  exists  in  the  current
standard model of cosmology [1-7]. The measured mass density of the gravity-interacting matter (normal
and dark) of the Universe is too small to fit in with, in the Friedmann equation, other two measurement
facts simultaneously that the Universe is spatially flat and that the Hubble constant falls between 70 and
72 km/sec/Mpc. A kind of energy, named the dark energy, is needed to make up around 70 percent of all
energy.  This  dark  energy  is  mysterious:  so  far  no  evidence  has  indicated  its  existence,  even  indirectly.
Since  the  discovery  of  cosmic  acceleration,  it  has  been  expected  to  possess  anti-gravitational  properties.
This expectation is rather illogical because a need of dark energy arises during applying Einstein’s theory
about gravity, unless anti-gravitational dark energy is subject to the same Einstein field equation as well
as the gravity-interacting matter.

Besides,  the  increasingly  accurate  cosmological  measurements  of  the  cosmic  microwave
background  [8-10]  and  the  high  red-shift  type  Ia  Supernovae  [11-13]  indicate  an  acceleration  of  the
expansion of the Universe. This cosmic acceleration is quite unexpected in the current standard model of
cosmology.  It  severely  challenges  the  current  standard  model  of  cosmology  and  urges  cosmologists  to
make  much  theoretical  corrections  and  attempts  including  to  probe  the  nature  of  mysterious  anti-
gravitational dark energy or quintessence field [14,15], to modify Einstein’s theory of gravitation [16-18]
and  to  develop  the  inflation  scenario  [19-20].  As  said,  “no  well-developed  and  well-motivated  solutions
have yet emerged” [17] to this problem, the problem of cosmic acceleration.

Recently,  based  on  Einstein’s  theory  of  gravitation  and  two  assumptions  of  the  cosmological
principle  and  the  perfect  fluid,  and  in  the  so-called  Z-approximation  that  the  most  probable  velocity
magnitude  of  the  perfect  fluid  vanishes,  we  customized  a  model  of  cosmology  in  the  Earth-related
coordinate system. This model is solvable. Its solution consists of three parts respectively on the value for
the  cosmological  constant,  Λ = 0 ,  and  the  equation  of  state  for  the  perfect  fluid,  ρ+ =p
0 ,  and  the
line element for space-time of the Universe [21-24],

the Earth at time  t  and determined to have frequency ν. It is then compared to a light signal of the same
type, emitted at time  t  on the Earth, whose frequency is  ν
0 . Experimental measurements indicate a red
shift of the light signal emitted on the galaxy,

The emissions of two light signals, at  t1  on the galaxy and at  t  on the Earth, are both of physical process
occurring  in  a  localized  small  region  of  space.  They  are  under  control  of  some  interaction  other  than
gravity. They are beyond physics of the gravitational field of the Universe. It is thus natural to recognize

as  the  formula  for  red-shift  of  light  signals  coming  from  distant  galaxies,  namely  the  modified  Hubble
law, where  H t( )  is called the red-shift coefficient. The red-shift coefficient varies with time. Comparing
Eqs.(7a-b) to the Hubble law [25]:  cz Hr=
, where   H  is the Hubble constant, we call  H t( )  the time-
varying Hubble parameter in reason.

The  time-varying  Hubble  parameter  enables  us  to  understand  the  observed  cosmic  acceleration.

In fact, It increases forever as time is running from the past to the future. The increasing rate is

which  is  nothing  but  the  cosmic  acceleration.  This  cosmic  acceleration  varies  with  time,  too.  The
nowadays cosmic acceleration will be estimated below.

The  time-varying  Hubble  parameter  also  enables  us  to  resolve  the  “missing  mass”  problem.  In

The nowadays cosmic acceleration is very small, too, but detectable.

In summary, the solvable model of cosmology constructed in the Earth-related coordinate system
has provided with the modified Hubble law from which the time-varying Hubble parameter has emerged.
The time-varying Hubble parameter has further led us to the observed cosmic acceleration and eliminated
the  need  of  dark  energy.  Because  8

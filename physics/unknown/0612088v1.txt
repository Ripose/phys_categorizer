Abstract 

The heart beat data recorded from samples before and during meditation are analyzed 

using two different scaling analysis methods. These analyses revealed that mediation 

severely affects the long range correlation of heart beat of a normal heart. Moreover, it 

is found that meditation induces periodic behavior in the heart beat. The complexity of 

the heart rate variability is quantified using multiscale entropy analysis and recurrence 

analysis. The complexity of the heart beat during mediation is found to be more.

Introduction 

Physiological  signals  are  endpoint  manifestation  of  cellular  events  that  depict 

how  physiological  systems  vary  over  time.  Extraordinary  complexity  of  the 

physiological  signals  and  the  recognition  that  physiologic  time  series  contain  hidden 

information  has  stimulated  growing  interest  in  applying  concepts  and  techniques  of 

statistical  and  nonlinear  physics  to  a  wide  range  of  biomedical  problem.  The  human 

heart beat is one of the important examples of complex physiologic fluctuations. It is 

considered  to  be  controlled  by  the  autonomic  nervous  system,  which  also  controls

many other vital functions within the body. This system is divided into two parts, the 

sympathetic  and  the  parasympathetic.  The  sympathetic  nervous  system  helps  to 

mobilize  the  body  for  action.  When  a  person  is  under  stress,  it  produces  ‘fight-or-

flight’  response.  The  parasympathetic  nervous  system  creates  what  is  usually  called 

the  ‘rest  and  digest’  response.  The  responses  of  the  parasympathetic  system  oppose 

those  of  the  sympathetic  system.  The  nonlinear  interaction  between  these  two 

branches  of  the  autonomic  nervous  system  and  the  competition  between  their 

stimulation effects are postulated mechanisms for erratic behavior of heart beat. Thus, 

heart  beat  is  considered  as  a  suitable  marker  for  the  estimation  of  the  autonomic 

nervous system function.  

 

Meditation  is  considered  to  be  one  of  the  complementary  and  alternative 

medicines to cardiovascular disease. People practice meditation for a number of health 

related purposes. However, it is not fully known what changes occur in body during 

meditation.  While  scientists  are  studying  whether  meditation  may  afford  meaningful 

health  benefits,  they  are  also  looking  at  how  it  may  do  so.  One  way  some  types  of 

meditation might work is by reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system 

and increasing the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system.  

 

Peng  et.  al.  [1]  first  made  a  quantitative  study  on  the  effect  of  meditation  on 

human heart beat. They collected and analyzed continuous heart rate time series from 

two  groups  of  healthy  young  and  adults  before  and  during  two  well  known  form  of 

meditation. Their intention was to determine (i) whether there are any distinctive heart 

rate dynamics during the meditation practices and (ii) whether such meditative states 

induce  a  quiescent  (less  variable)  or  active  (more  variable)  pattern  of  autonomic

response. They applied spectral analysis and a technique based on Hilbert transform to 

quantify  the  heart  rate  dynamics  during  meditation.  They  reported  extremely 

prominent  heart  rate  oscillations  associated  with  slow  breathing  during  meditation. 

The amplitude of oscillations during meditation is significantly greater than in the pre-

meditation control state. 

 

Recently Capurra et. al. [2] have also studied the heart beat data recorded during 

meditation.  They  have  shown  that  the  embedding  of  the  experimental  beat-to-beat 

interval data acquires a polygonal shape during meditation and that the time course of 

respiration depends on the meditation technique. They have presented a model for the 

influence of respiration on the heart beat-to-beat time interval series. 

Meditation data 

 

The term ‘meditation’ refers to a group of techniques, most of which started in 

Eastern  religious  or  spiritual  traditions.  These  techniques  have  been  used  by  many 

different  cultures  throughout  the  world  for  thousands  of  years.  Today,  many  people 

use  meditation  outside  of  its  traditional  religious  or  cultural  settings,  for  health  and 

wellness  purposes.  In  meditation,  a  person  learns  to  focus  his  attention  and  suspend 

the  stream  of  thoughts  that  normally  occupy  the  mind.  This  practice  is  believed  to 

result  in  a  state  of  greater  physical  relaxation,  mental  calmness,  and  psychological 

balance. 

 

To  study  the  effect  of  meditation  on  heart  beat  we  used  time  series,  from 

physionet [3], of 8 subjects prior and during Chinese Chi meditation. The heart beat-

to-beat intervals were obtained from electrocardiogram (ECG) data by Peng et al. [1] 

and made available in physionet. These eight Chi meditators, 5 women and 3 men (age 

 

3

range 26–35 years), wore a Holter recorder for approximately 10 h during which time 

they went about their ordinary daily activities. After approximately 5 h of recording, 

each  one  of  them  practiced  1  h  of  meditation.  During  these  sessions,  the  Chi 

meditators  sat  quietly,  listening  to  the  taped  guidance  of  the  master.  The  meditators 

were instructed to breath spontaneously while visualizing the opening and closing of a 

perfect lotus on the abdomen. 

Scaling Analysis 

Scaling  as  a  manifestation  of  the  underlying  dynamics  is  familiar  throughout 

physics.  It  has  been  instrumental  in  helping  scientists  gain  deeper  insights  into 

problems ranging across the entire spectrum of science and technology. Scaling laws 

typically  reflect  underlying  generic  features  and  physical  principles  that  are 

independent  of  detailed  dynamics  or  characteristics  of  particular  models.  Scale 

invariance has been found to hold empirically for a number of complex systems, and 

the  correct  evaluation  of  the  scaling  exponents  is  of  fundamental  importance  in 

assessing if universality classes exist [4]. Scale invariance seems to be widespread in 

natural systems. Numerous examples of scale invariance properties can be found in the 

literature  like  earthquakes,  clouds,  networks  etc  [5-7].  To  study  the  effect  of 

meditation  on  the  scaling  behavior  of  heart  beat  the  following  analyses  were 

performed.

Detrended Fluctuation Analysis 

 

Heartbeat time series is often highly non-stationary. This creates an immediate 

problem to researchers applying the conventional techniques of time series analysis to 

heartbeat data analysis. There are various methods of scaling analysis. In recent years, 

the  detrended  fluctuation  analysis  (DFA)  proposed  by  Peng  et.  al.  [8]  has  been 

established  as  an  important  tool  for  the  detection  of  long-range  correlations  in  time 

series with non-stationarities. It avoids the spurious detection of apparent long-range 

correlations that are an artifact of non-stationarity [9]. This method has been validated 

on synthetically generated time series superposed with non-stationary trends and also 

been  successfully  applied  to  such  diverse  field  of  interest  as  DNA,  heart  rate 

dynamics, temperature fluctuations, rainfall records [8, 10-12] etc. 

 

The DFA procedure consists of the following steps. In the first step, the profile

is determined from the time series

x  indicates the mean value of

’s.  Next,  the  profile 

)(kY

is  divided  into 

N n =

[

nN
/

]

non-overlapping  segments 

of equal length . In the next step, the local trend for each segment is calculated by a 

n

least-square  fit  of  the  data.  The  y-coordinate  of  the  fitted  line  is  denoted  by 

)(kYn

. 

Then the detrended time series for the segment duration  n is defined as 

kY

                                                  (2) 

The  root-mean  square  fluctuation  of  the  original  time  series  and  the  detrended  time 

series is calculated by

Repeating this calculation over all segment sizes, a relationship between

 and 

n

is 

obtained. If 

)(nF

 behaves as a power law function of

n

, data present scaling:

                                                                   (4) 

Finally  the  double  logarithmic  plot  of   

)(nF

  versus 

n

is  used  to  calculate  the  slope, 

which gives the scaling exponent

β. 

If

series  is  long-range  correlated. 

5.0=β

  corresponds  to  Gaussian  white  noise,  while 

1=β   indicates  the 

f/1

noise,  typical  of  systems  in  a    SOC  state.  For 

1>β , 

correlations  exist  but  not  like  a  power  law  form. 

5.1=β

  indicates  Brown  noise, 

which is simply the integration of white noise. 

Diffusion Entropy Analysis 

The  diffusion  entropy  analysis  (DEA)  [13]  is  primarily  developed  to  detect  the 

scaling behavior of stationary time series. To apply DEA to the heart beat time series, 

following the idea of Ghasemi et. al. [14], we have calculated the return from the heart 

beat data using the formula:

=ξ
i

ln(

x +
1
i

/

x

i

)

. The return series is stationary, which can 

be straightforwardly verified.  

DEA  is  based  on  the  prescription  that  numbers  in  a  time  series  {ξi}  are  the 

fluctuations  of  a  diffusion  trajectory;  see  Refs.  [13,15,16]  for  details.  Therefore,  we 

shift our attention from the time series {ξi} to probability density function (pdf) p(z,t) 

of  the  corresponding  diffusion  process.  Here  z  denotes  the  variable  collecting  the 

 

6

fluctuations and is referred to as the diffusion variable. The scaling property of p(z,t) 

takes the form

                                             (5) 

The  DEA  was  developed  [13]  as  an  efficient  way  to  detect  the  scaling  and 

memory  in  time  series  for  variables  in  complex  systems.  This  procedure  has  been 

successfully  applied  to  sociological,  astrophysical,  metallurgical  and  financial  time 

series [17-20]. DEA focuses on the scaling exponent δ evaluated through the Shannon 

entropy S(t) of the diffusion generated by  the fluctuations { }iξ  of the time series [13, 

15].  Here,  the  pdf  of  the  diffusion  process,

Complexity Measure 

A system consisting of many parts which are connected in a nonlinear fashion is 

designated  as the complex system. In a  complex system, the interaction between the 

parts allows the emergence of global behavior that would not be anticipated from the 

behavior  of  components  in  isolation,  which  posses  a  real  threat  to  deal  it  properly 

whereas  understanding  its  behavior  offers  possibility  of  spectacular  and  unforeseen 

advances in many areas of science and its application. It is this threat and this promise 

that  is  making  the  science  of  complex  systems  as  of  the  fastest  growing  areas  of 

science  at  the  present  time.  Recently  there  have  been  some  attempts  to  quantify  the 

complexity of the complex systems [21-23].  Though  there  is  no  formal  definition  of 

complexity,  it  is  considered  to  be  a  measure  of  the  inherent  difficulty  to  achieve  the 

desired  understanding.  Simply  stated,  the  complexity  of  a  system  is  the  amount  of 

information necessary to describe it. 

Quantifying the complexity of the time series from a physical process may be of 

considerable interest due to its potential application in evaluating a dynamical model 

of  the  system.  In  this  section,  we  present  a  quantitative  study  of  the  measure  of 

complexity of the heartbeat data recorded during and prior meditation. Entropy based 

algorithm  are  often  used  to  quantify  the  regularity  of  a  time  series  [24].  Increase  in 

entropy  corresponds  to  the  increase  in  the  degree  of  disorder  and  for  a  completely 

random system it is maximum. Traditional algorithms are single-scale based [21-24]. 

However, time series derived from the complex systems are likely to present structure 

on multiple temporal scales. In contrast, time series derived from a simpler system are 

likely  to  present  structures  on  just  a  single  scale.  For  these  reasons  the  traditional 

 

8

single scale based algorithms often yield misleading quantifications of the complexity 

of a system. 

Recently Costa et al. [25-27] introduced a new method, Multiscale Entropy (MSE) 

analysis  for  measuring  the  complexity  of  finite  length  time  series.  This  method 

measures complexity taking into account the multiple time scales. This computational 

tool can be quite effectively used to quantify the complexity of a natural time series. 

The first multiple scale measurement of the complexity was proposed by Zhang [28]. 

Zhang's method was based on the Shannon entropy which requires a large number of 

almost  noise  free  data.  On  the  contrary,  the  MSE  method  uses  Sample  Entropy 

(SampEn)  to  quantify  the  regularity  of  finite  length  time  series.  SampEn  is  largely 

independent  of  the  time  series  length  when  the  total  number  of  data  points  is  larger 

than  approximately  750  [29].  Thus  MSE  proved  to  be  quite  useful  in  analyzing  the 

finite length time series over the Zhang's method. Recently MSE has been successfully 

applied  to  quantify  the  complexity  of  many  Physiologic  and  Biological  signals  [25-

27].  

Multiscale Entropy Analysis 

The MSE method is based on the evaluation of SampEn on the multiple scales. 

The prescription of the MSE analysis is: given a one-dimensional discrete time series, 

{x1,.....,xi,....,xN},  construct  the  consecutive  coarse-grained  time  series,  {

})(τy

, 

determined by the scale factor, τ, according to the equation:

where  τrepresents  the  scale  factor  and

Nj ≤≤

.  The  length  of  each  coarse-

grained time series is  τ/N

. For scale one, the coarse-grained time series is simply the 

original time series. Next we calculate the SampEn for each scale using the following 

method.  Let

Advantage of SampEn is that it is less dependent on time series length and is relatively 

consistent  over  broad  range  of  possible  r,  m  and  N  values.  We  have  calculated 

SampEn for all the studied data sets with the parameters m=2 and r= 0.15äSD (SD is 

the standard deviation of the original time series). 

Recurrence Analysis 

 

Eckman,  Kamphorst  and  Ruelle  [30]  proposed  a  new  method  to  study  the 

recurrences  and  nonstationary  behaviour  occurring  in  dynamical  system.  They 

 

10

designated the method as “recurrence plot” (RP). The method is found to be efficient 

in identification of system properties that cannot be observed using other conventional 

linear and nonlinear approaches. Moreover, the method has been found very useful for 

analysis  of  nonstationary  system  with  high  dimension  and  noisy  dynamics.  The 

method can be outlined as follows: given a time series {xi} of N data points, first the 

phase space vectors ui={xi,xi+τ,……,xi+(d-1)τ}are constructed using Taken’s time delay 

method.  The  embedding  dimension  (d)  can  be  estimated  from  the  false  nearest 

neighbor method. The time delay (τ) can be estimated either from the autocorrelation 

function or from the mutual information method. The main step is then to calculate the 

N×N matrix

where εi is a cutoff distance, ||..|| is a norm ( we have taken the Euclidean norm), and 

Θ(x) is the Heavyside function. The cutoff distance εi defines a sphere centered at 

ix . 

If 

jx  falls within this sphere, the state will be close to 

ix and thus 

iR

, =j

. The binary 

values in 

iR ,

j

 can be simply visualized by a matrix plot with color black (1) and white 

(0). This plot is called the recurrence plot.  

However, it is often not very straight forward to conclude about the dynamics of the 

system  from  the  visual  inspection  of  the  RPs.  Zbilut  and  Webber  [31,32]  developed 

the  so  called  recurrence  quantification  analysis  (RQA)  to  provide  quantification  of 

important aspects revealed through the plot. The RQA proposed by Zbilut and Webber 

is mostly based on the diagonal structures in the RPs. They defined different measures, 

the  recurrence  rate  (REC)  measures  the  fraction  of  black  points  in  the  RP,  the 

 

11

determinism (DET) measure of the fraction recurrent points forming the diagonal line 

structure,  the  maximal  length  of  diagonal  structures  (Lmax),  the  entropy  (Shannon 

entropy  of  the  line  segment  distributions)  and  the  trend  (measure  of  the  paling  of 

recurrent points away from the central diagonal). These parameters are used to detect 

the transitions in the time series. Recently Gao [33] emphasized the importance of the 

vertical structures in RPs and introduced a recurrence time statistics corresponding to 

the  vertical  structures  in  RP.  Marwan  et.  al.  [34]  extended  Gao’s  view  and  defined 

measures  of  complexity  based  on  the  distribution  of  the  vertical  line  length.  They 

introduced three new RP based measures: the laminarity, the trapping time (TT) and 

the maximal length of the vertical structures (Vmax). Laminarity is analogous to DET 

and  gives  the  measure  of  the  amount  of  vertical  structure  in  the  RP  and  represents 

laminar states in the system. TT contains information about the amount as well as the 

length of the vertical structure. Applying these measures to the logistic map data they 

found that in contrast to the conventional RQA measures, their  measures are able to 

identify  the  laminar  states  i.e.  chaos-chaos  transitions.  The  vertical  structure  based 

measures were also found very successful to detect the laminar phases before the onset 

of  life-threatening  ventricular  tachyarrhythmia.  Here  we  have  applied  the  measures 

proposed  by  Marwan  et.  al.  along  with  the  traditional  measures  to  find  the  effect  of 

meditation on the heart-rate variability data. 

Results and discussions 

 

Heart beat sequences have been a topic of many time series analysis in the last 

few years. Recent studies reveal that at normal conditions, heart beat rate fluctuations 

display extended correlation of the type typically exhibited by dynamical systems far 

 

12

from  equilibrium.  Scaling  analysis  of  the  heart  beat  sequences  showed  that  certain 

disease  states  alter  the  scale-invariant  correlation  property  of  the  normal  heart  beat 

[35].  Here  we  study  how  meditation  affects  the  scaling  behavior  of  the  heart  beat 

sequences. Fig. 3 shows the typical plot DFA of the representative data of Fig. 1. As 

mentioned  earlier,  DFA  reveals  the  correlation  property  of  the  time  series  data.  It  is 

seen  that  meditation  severely  affects  the  long  range  correlation  property  of  the  heart 

beat. There is cross over in the scaling behavior. The scaling exponents are shown in 

the  figure.  DEA  is  relatively  a  new  method  to  detect  the  scaling  behavior  of  time 

series  data.  In  contrast  to  several  variance-based  methods,  including  DFA,  DEA 

studies  the  scaling  behavior  of  the  probability  distribution.  This  makes  it  useful  to 

detect  the  scaling  behavior  of  time  series  even  if  the  variance  diverges.  Due  to  the 

stationary  requirement,  we  have  applied  DEA  to  the  return  series.  Fig  4  shows  the 

typical plot of the DEA of the return of the Fig 2. The inset in Fig 4 shows the plot 

DEA of the heart beat data of Fig 1. The DEA of return shows that during meditation 

the  long  range  correlation  in  heart  beat  sequences  is  lost.  Moreover,  DEA  reveals 

periodic behavior in the heart beat return during mediation.  

 

Quantification of complexity of physiologic time series, primarily of heart rate, 

has been of considerable interest during recent years. Costa et. al. [25] applied MSE to 

quantify  the  complexity  of  heart  rate  time  series  derived  from  healthy  subjects, 

patients with severe congestive heart failure and patients with the cardiac arrhythmia, 

atrial  fibrillation.  Here  we  apply  MSE  to  the  heart  beat  rate  time  series  to  study  the 

complexity of the heart rate during meditation. Fig 5 shows the variation of the sample 

entropy as a function of scale factor for the heart rate time series recorded prior and 

 

13

during meditation. It is seen that at small scale the sample entropy is almost similar for 

both cases but at larger scale the sample entropy is much higher for the heart beat rate 

time series recorded during meditation. This signifies that the complexity of the heart 

beat rate is higher during meditation. 

 

RQA  has  been  used  to  study  the  heart  rate  variability  data  on  many  occasions 

[36-38]. The false nearest neighbor method yielded embedding dimension ~ 10. The 

time delay obtained from the mutual information is ~ 10. We have used d and τ both 

10 in the RQA. We have selected the value 2 for εi, from the scaling curve of REC vs. 

εi  as  suggested  in  literature  [36].  Figure  6  shows  the  typical  recurrence  plots  for  the 

pre  and  during  mediation  heart  rate  time  series  data.  We  have  calculated  the  RQA 

parameters for several small time window (epoch) of the heart beat time series. Figure 

7  shows  the  variation  of  different  RQA  parameters  with  the  epoch  number.  The 

differences  in  the  RQA  parameters  for  pre  and  during  meditation  hear  beat  data  is 

evident  from  the  plots.  To  confirm  the  difference  in  the  RQA  parameters  we  have 

carried out nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test [39] on the parameters. The results of 

the test are shown in Table 1.  

The results in this paper raise several questions on the effect of meditation on heart as 

well as the origin of scaling behavior in the Heart rate variability. The answers to the 

questions  are  not  straightforward-further  study  is  necessary  which  will  in  turn  also 

help to understand the physiology of heart.

Conclusion 

 

In conclusion, we have studied the effect of meditation on human heart beat by 

analyzing  the  heart  beat  record  from  eight  samples  prior  and  during  Chi  meditation. 

DFA  revealed  that  mediation  destroys  the  long  range  correlation  exhibited  by  the 

normal  heart.  DEA  of  the  heart  beat  return  showed  a  periodic  behavior  in  the  heart 

beat during meditation. From the MSE analysis it is found that the complexity of the 

heart rate variability increases during meditation. The recurrence analysis revealed the 

differences in the heart rate variability data recorded during and before meditation.

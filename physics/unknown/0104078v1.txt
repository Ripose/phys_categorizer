The  Lie  group  of  symmetry  of  the  one-dimensional  differential
equation  of  electron  magnetohydrodynamics  with  effect  of  electron
inertia  and  finite  conducting  is  found.  It's  indicated  that  this  group  is
group  of  shift  of  independent  variables  and  non  single-valuety  of  a
potential.  Therefore  thee  no  automodel  solution  except  for  running
vawes.

Ellectron    magnetohydrodynamics  (EMH)  is  a  modern  branch  of  plasma
physics.  It's  the  multicomponent  magnetohydrodynamics  based  on  quasi-neutrality,
the Hall effect and negligible ion motion. EMH has many applications to problems of
pulsed plasmas at al.  Remarkable effect of EMH is transformed skin problem. The
exact  solution  of  this  problem  is  found  as  chock  vawe  in  virtue  of  reduced  EMH
equation without electron inertia to the  Burgers equation.[1].

It's well known that one can do some inference about a sulution of non-
linear diferential equation  knowing  it's  Lie  group.  The  agregation  of  Lie  groups  for
the  Burgers  equation  [2]  and  Lie-Backlund  groups  for  EMH  equation  with  infinite
conducting and inertia of electrons [3] are known. But the searcing group for EMH
equation  with  both  electron  inertia  and  finite  conducting  is  actual  problem.  It's  the
problem of this work.

It's comfortable for searhing group to write (1) as equation for potential  u (

zuB =

):

ut – (c/ωpe)2uzzt + k/2uz

2 – k/2(c/ωpe)2uzz

2 = Duzz .                         (2)

The  standard  technique  of  group  analysis  is  written  in  [2].  Applying  this  technique
we have the infinitesimal criterion of invariance for coefficients ξ, τ, φ:

φt – (c/ωpe)2φzzt + kφzuz – k(c/ωpe)2φzzuzz = Dφzz,

where
φz = Dzφ – uzDzξ – utDzτ ;   φt = Dtφ – uzDtξ - utDtτ ;

φzz = Dz

2φ –uzDz

2ξ – utDz2τ – 2uzzDzξ – 2uztDzτ ;

φzzt = Dz

2Dtφ – utDz

2Dtτ – 2uztDzDtτ – uzztDtτ – uzDz

2Dtξ – 2uzzDzDtξ – uzzzDtξ –

 uttDz

2τ – uztDz

2ξ – 2uzttDzτ – 2uzztDzξ.

The defining system of equation is:

ξu = ξt = τu = τz = 0
φuu = 0
2φuz – ξzz = 0
(c/ωpe)2φ uzz-  2ξz= 0

(c/ωpe)2φ uzz + τt - 4ξz + φu = 0
(c/ωpe)2φ uzz + τt - 2ξz + φu = 0             (3)
(c/ωpe)2φ ut +Dτt=0
φt – (c/ωpe)2φzzt - Dφzz=0

The solution of (3) is: ξ=С1, τ=С2, φ=С3, С1,2,3 = const.
The vector fields are: v1=∂t, v2=∂z, v3=∂u.
The groups generated those fields are:

G1:(z+ε, t, u), G2:(z, t+ε, u), G3:(z, t, u+ε),  

R∈ε

.                    (4)

The  G1  and  G2  are  groups  of  shift  of  independent  variables.  The  G3  is

connected with non single-valuety of a potential.

It's visually  that  group of  symmetry  of  (2)  is less than group  of symmetry  of
Burgers equation. It don't admit any linearizing substitution and  there is one useful

solution as corollary of the invariant of the group. It's a running wave 
This solution sees in [1].

From the result about Lie group (4) it will be observed that there are no other

simplifications.

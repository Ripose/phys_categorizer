Although DNA damage is widely viewed as a critical target for the induction of cell killing by ionizing radiation, the exact 
nature of DNA damage responsible for these effects is unknown. To address this issue, the probability of forming lethal 
damage  by  single  proton  tracks,  derived  from  published  survival  data  for  Chinese  hamster  V79  cells  irradiated  by 
protons  with  energies  from  0.57  to  5.01 MeV,  has  been  compared  to  estimated  yields  of  complex  DNA  double-strand 
breaks (DSBs) calculated by Monte Carlo models. The reported studies indicate that total DSB yields and the yields of 
other  classes  of  clustered  DNA  damage  do  not  correlate  well  with  trends  in  the  expected  number  of  lethal  events  for 
protons  with  increasing  linear  energy  transfer  (LET).  However,  a  good  correlation  was  found  between  the  number  of 
lethal  events  and  the  yields  of  DSBs  consisting  of  8  or  more  elementary  DNA  lesions.  These  results  indicate  that 
differences  in  the  relative  biological  effectiveness  (RBE)  of  radiations  of  diverse  quality  can  be  plausibly  linked  to  the 
initial yield of complex DSBs, which may be intrinsically unrepairable or are often lethally mis-rejoined. 

INTRODUCTION 

in 

and 

cell  death 

reproductive 

Cell killing by ionizing radiation can be attributed to at 
least  two  distinct  mechanisms:  DNA  damage  that 
results 
cell 
communication  leading  to  the  induction  of  apoptosis. 
Reproductive  death  is  primarily  attributed  to  lethal 
exchange-type chromosome aberrations, such as centric 
rings  and  dicentrics (1),  which  arise  from  the  pairwise 
mis-rejoining  of  DNA  double-strand  breaks  (DSBs). 
Differences  in  the  yields  and  complexity  of  the  initial 
DNA  damage  formed  by  radiations  of  diverse  quality 
are  often  assumed  to  account  for  differences  in 
biological effectiveness (2, 3). Although over 95% of the 
initial DSBs formed by radiation are rejoined, complex 
DSBs  may  be  intrinsically  unrepairable  and  lethal. 
Alternatively, 
the  slower  rate  of  complex  DSB 
rejoining (4)  may  increase  the  chance  pairs  of  DSBs 
interact to form lethal exchange-type aberrations. Mis-
repaired  or  unrepairable  single-strand  breaks  (SSBs) 
and  sites  of  multiple  damaged  bases  may  also 
contribute to cell killing.  

In the present work, the yields of single-track lethal 
events,  derived  by  direct  analyses  of  experimental 
survival  data  for  V79  Chinese  hamster  cells  after 
irradiation  by  protons  at  several  LET  (linear  energy 
transfer)  values,  have  been  compared  with  estimated 
yields  of  different  classes  of  complex  DNA  lesions 
calculated  using  Monte  Carlo  methods.  These 
comparisons have been motivated by the effort to help 
elucidate  some  of  the  putative  mechanisms  of  DNA

damage-related  cell  killing  and  their  dependence  on 
radiation quality. 

METHODS 

The  probabilities  that  protons  of  different  LET  induce 
lethal  lesions  in  V79  cells  have  been  derived (5, 6)  by 
analyzing  measured  cell  survival  data (7, 8)  for  protons 
with  energies  ranging  from  0.57 
to  5.01 MeV, 
corresponding  to  LET  values  7.7  –  37.8 keV/µm.  The 
yields of lethal events have been estimated on the basis 
of  the  probabilistic  two-stage  model (9)  which  enables 
to  differentiate  between  the  single-  and  multi-particle 
(collective)  effects  of  the  underlying  radiobiological 
damage 
average 
mechanism. 
probabilities have been converted to numbers of lethal 
lesions  per  cell  per Gy  using  the  average  number  of 
tracks, h, per cell nucleus per Gy.

simulation 

Monte  Carlo  simulations  of  different  classes  of 
damage  to  DNA  have  been  performed  using  the  fast 
Monte  Carlo 
algorithm 
(MCDS) (10). The algorithm gives not only the yields of 
different  damage  classes  but  also  their  configurations. 
Repair outcomes for DNA damage configurations other 
than  the  DSB  were  computed  using  the  Monte  Carlo 
excision  repair  model  (MCER) (11, 12)  in  combination 
with  the  MCDS  algorithm.  In  addition  to  providing 
estimates  of  the  number  of  point  mutations  formed 
through the misrepair of SSB and sites of multiple base 
simulations  provide 
damage, 
estimates  of  the  number  of  DSBs  formed  through  the 
aborted  excision  repair  of  complex  SSBs  (i.e., 
enzymatic DSBs).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 

Figure 1 shows the estimated yields of different classes 
of DNA lesions (DSBs, SSBs, and other lesions). Also 
shown  are  the  predicted  numbers  of  enzymatic  DSB 
formed through the aborted excision repair of complex 
SSBs  and  the  numbers  of  SSBs  and  base  damages 
converted  to  point  mutations  through  excision  repair. 
The initial numbers of SSBs and sites of base damage 
(non-strand break lesions) exhibit a downward trend as 
the  LET  of  the protons  increases.  However,  the  initial 
DSB  yield  shows  an  upward  trend  with  increasing 
LET.  For  the  range  of  proton  energies  considered,  the 
predicted yield of prompt DSBs is 70 – 120 Gy-1 cell-1. 
The  numbers  of  enzymatic  DSBs  are  almost  identical 
with the yields of mis-repaired lesions; for both lesion 
categories 
increase  with  LET  from 
approx. 40  to  70 Gy-1 cell-1.  The  present  results  are 
based  on  simulating  DNA  damage  configurations  and 
their  repair  outcomes  in  a  total  of  106 cells  for  each 
proton energy (LET value); standard errors of the mean 
are smaller than the symbols. It has been assumed that 
the  repair  of  all  non-DSB  lesions  proceeds  via  the 
short-patch base excision repair (SP BER) pathway.

Figure 1: Initial yield of DSBs, SSBs and other DNA damage 
clusters  for  protons  with  energies  from  0.57  to  5.01 MeV. 
Also,  shown  are  the  estimated  numbers  of  mis-repaired 
clusters  converted  to  point  mutations  through  the  short-patch 
base  excision  repair  of  SSBs  and  damaged  bases,  and  the 
yields of enzymatic DSBs following from the aborted repair of 
complex  SSBs.  Calculations  according  to  the  MCDS (10)  and 
MCER  models (11, 12).  Yields  of  lethal  events,  as  derived  by 
direct analyses of survival data (5), are shown for comparison, 
too. 
 

The  estimated  numbers  of  lethal  events,  as  derived 
from  analyzing  experimental  data  for  clonogenic  cell 
survival  of  V79  cells  after  proton  irradiation  in  the 
studied  LET  region (5, 6),  are  typically  0.01 – 1  per Gy 
per cell (Figure 1). The comparison of lethal events and 
damage yields shown in Figure 1 demonstrates that the 
vast majority of all classes of DNA damage, including 
DSBs,  are  repaired  in  a  way  that  is  non-lethal. 
Consequently, the initial yield of DNA damage or even 
specific  classes  of  damage,  such  as  the  DSBs,  cannot

DSB lesions to cell killing. 
 

Complex  DSBs  are  believed  to  pose  significant 
challenges  for  cellular  repair  systems (2, 3).  To  test  the 
hypothesis  that  complex  DSBs  are  the  main  damage 
responsible for cell killing, the yields of prompt DSBs 
simulated  by  the  MCDS  algorithm  were  sub-divided 
into DSBs of varying complexity, i.e. according to the 
number  of  elementary  DNA  lesions  (strand  breaks, 
base  damage  or  abasic  sites)  per  cluster.  Figure 2 
shows estimates of the yields of DSBs consisting of at 
least 4, 6, 8, and 10 elementary DNA lesions (denoted 
by  DSB 4+,  6+,  8+,  and 10+),  respectively.  Figure 3 
shows the ratio of the expected number of lethal events 
per DSB, neglecting the cell killing effects of any mis-
repaired  lesions  other  than  DSBs.  The  ratio  of  lethal 
events among all DSBs increases with increasing LET 
but is only about 0.05 – 0.5%, which implies that more 
than  99.5%  of  all  DSBs  formed  are  rejoined  in  ways 
that  are  not  lethal.  The  ratio  of  lethal  events  per 
DSB 10+  exhibits  a  decreasing  trend  with  increasing 
LET.  This  observation  indicates  that  the  DSB 10+

category of damage does not include all specific classes 
of  damage  involved  in  cell  killing.  However,  the  ratio 
of  lethal  events  per  DSB 8+  is  nearly  independent  of 
particle LET, which suggests that this class of DSBs is 
a  candidate  for  the  damage  most  responsible  for 
initiating  cell  death.  Because  the  initial  yield  of 
DSB 8+  is  at  least  an  order  of  magnitude  higher  than 
the number of lethal events, only a subset of this class 
of DSB (about 3 – 5%) is converted to a lethal form of 
damage. 

In  the  present  work,  the  potential  contribution  of 
lesions  other  than  DSBs  to  radiation-induced  cell 
killing  has  been  neglected.  Most  if  not  all  enzymatic 
DSBs,  formed  through  the  aborted  repair  of  complex 
SSBs,  will  be  subsequently 
rejoined  by  non-
homologous  end-joining 
(NHEJ)  or  homologous 
recombination (HR) processes. Nevertheless, given that 
the  yields  of  mis-repaired  lesions  and  also  enzymatic 
DSBs are comparable to the numbers of prompt DSBs 
(Figure 1), this issue needs to be examined carefully in 
the  future.  The  yields  of  enzymatic  DSBs  and 
especially  of  mis-repaired  lesions  is  expected  to  be 
even  higher  if  the  long-patch  base  excision  repair  (LP 
BER)  pathway  is  involved  in  the  repair  of  clustered 
DNA lesions (Figure 4 and the discussion in Ref. (12)).

Abstract 

A solid-state laser system that produces a 1MHz pulse train of 800 pulses with 18 µJ per 

pulse at λ = 263.5 nm has been developed to meet the requirements of the TESLA Test 

Facility (TTF) at Fermilab and in operation since 1998.[1,2]  Besides the production of 

high  charges,  high  brightness  electron  beams,  the  need  for  high  bunch  charge  stability 

requires that each laser pulse in the pulse train must have the same energy, and the energy 

per  laser  pulse  should  not  vary  significantly  from  shot  to  shot.    This  motivates  the 

stability analysis of the laser system for the TTF photoinjector. 

Laser System 

A mode-locked Nd:YLF oscillator produces a low energy, continuous pulse train at 81.25 

MHz.    Pulses  from  the  oscillator  are  stretched  and  chirped  in  a  2  km  fiber.    After  the 

fiber, a train of 800 pulses is selected at 1 MHz from the oscillator pulse train by a high 

speed,  low  voltage,  lithium  tantalate  (LTA)  Pockels  cell  (Conoptic  Inc.,  model  360-80 

modulator).  Each of the 800 pulses are injected into a multipass amplifier which contains 

a  flashlamp-pumped,  1/4×6  inch  Nd:glass  rod  amplifier  and  a  fast  KD*P  Q-switching 

Pockels cell (Conoptics Inc., model 350-105).  Each pulse is trapped in the cavity by the 

Pockels cell and makes 22 passes through the cavity, amplifying up to 40 µJ before it is 

ejected  by  the  Pockels  cell.    A  Faraday  isolator  separates  the  input  and  output  pulses.  

Two  flashlamp-pumped,  Nd:glass  rod  amplifier  is  used  in  a  two-pass  configuration  to 

provide an additional gain of 5.  The energy in each pulse after the two-pass amplifier is 

expected to 200 µJ.  Following the two-pass amplifier, the beam is spatially filtered, and

then compressed in time using a pair of parallel diffraction gratings.  The pulse length is 

adjustable  in  the  range  of  3  ps  to  30  ps.    The  pulses  are  frequency  doubled  and 

quadrupled in a pair of BBO crystals.  The UV pulse train is expanded and transported 20 

m in vacuum to a final set of imaging optics, which relays the beam to the photocathode. 

The primary challenge in the laser system is in producing uniform amplification 

for all pulses in the pulse train and pulse-to-pulse stability.  The gain of each amplifier 

can  vary  substantially  during  the  macropulse  (pulse  train)  depending  on  the  pump  rate 

and the rate at which the stored energy is extracted by amplifier action and spontaneous 

emission.   

Each of the laser amplifiers is driven by a custom designed power supply, which 

provides  nearly  constant  current  discharge  to  the  flashlamps  for  more  than  800  µs.  

Because the amplifiers are not run to saturation, the amplitude of the output is sensitive to 

small  changes  in  the  gain  on  shot-to-shot  basis.    It  is  preferable  to  run  the  multipass 

amplifier with higher gain and fewer passes to reduce amplitude fluctuations. 

Simplified Model for Stability Analysis 

The  major  contributions  to  pulse-to-pulse  fluctuation  of  the  infrared  (IR)  pulses  before

after  two-pass  amplifier,  Gmp  is  the  gain  of  multipass  amplifier,  G2p  is  the  gain  of  two-

pass amplifier.  N is the round-trip number of multipass amplifier. 

Eq.  (2)  is  obtained  by  differentiating  eq.  (1)  and  we  assume  that  (Iout)n  is  only 

dependent upon the selected pulse Ipp, the gain of multipass amplifier Gmp, and the gain of 

the  two-pass  amplifier  G2p.    It  is  clear  from  eq.  (2)  that  the  contributions  to  the  energy 

fluctuation of the IR pulses after two-pass amplifier are coming from the gain fluctuation 

of  multipass  amplifier,  the  gain  fluctuation  of  two-pass  amplifier,  and  the  energy 

fluctuation of the selected pulses.  Besides that, the contribution from multipass amplifier 

 

2

is N times larger than that of two-pass amplifier whenever the gain of multipass amplifier 

fluctuates at the same level with that of two-pass amplifier. 

Experimental Results 

One of the major contributions to the gain fluctuation of the flashlamp-pumped amplifier 

is the capacitor bank voltage fluctuation.  The flashlamp is fired when the capacitor bank 

of  the  power  supply  is  discharging.    Since  there  is  a  square  relationship  between  the 

flashlight  intensity  and  the  capacitor  bank  voltage,  for  example,  a  2%  increase  of  the 

capacitor bank voltage will bring a 4% increase of the flashlight intensity, and this will 

cause a 4% increase of the gain.  It often takes eleven round trips for a selected pulse to 
be amplified by multipass amplifier, and according to eq. (2), there is a 137% (1.0411×2-1) 

energy  increase  after  multipass  amplifier.    Therefore,  we  did  the  following  experiment: 

we measured the energy of amplified pulses after multipass amplifier as a function of the 

capacitor bank voltage of the flashlamp power supply.  Each data point was taken by a 

120-shot  average  of  the  laser  energy  meter  in  order  to  minimize  the  influence  of  the 

selected  pulse  fluctuation.    The  result  is  shown  in  Fig.  1,  and  it  is  consistent  with  our 

analysis. 

Secondly, we did the measurement about the correlation between the selected pulse from 

the  oscillator  and  its  amplified  pulse  after  multipass  amplifier.    A  schematic  of  the 

experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2.  We used cable delay to match the selected pulse 

and  its  amplified  pulse  after  multipass  amplifier  and  connected  them  to  a  Lecroy  540 

scope  in  order  to  use  x-y  plot  to  find  their  correlation.    In  Fig.  3,  x-axis  represents  the 

selected  pulse,  and  y-axis  represents  the  amplified  pulse.    Line  AB,  which  is  nearly 

perpendicular  to  x-axis,  indicates  the  situation  that  the  amplified  pulses  after  multipass 

amplifier can vary in a wide range even if their selected pulses have the same intensity.  

Here,  the  intensity  fluctuation  of  the  amplified  pulses  after  multipass  amplifier  can  be 

expressed by the ratio between yB and yA, which is 2.6, and from which we can estimate 

that  the  gain  fluctuation  of  multipass  amplifier  is  about  160%.    We  also  did  the 

correlation measurement on the pulses before and after two-pass amplifier.  The result is 

shown in Fig. 4.  Since all the points are located in the region between line 1 and line 2 

with a slope of 19.5 and 23 separately, the maximum of the gain fluctuation of two-pass 

amplifier is about 16%.

It  is  clear  from  the  above  experiments  that  the  major  contribution  to  the  energy 

fluctuation  of  the  IR  pulses  before  doubling  crystal  is  the  gain  fluctuation  of  mulitpass 

amplifier.  The cause of the gain fluctuation of flashlamp-pumped amplifier that can be 

measured in our lab is the fluctuation of the capacitor bank voltage, which is about 1%.  

From  the  above  analysis,  the  1%  fluctuation  in  the  capacitor  bank  voltage  brings  about 

55% intensity fluctuation of the multipass amplifier output.  Based upon the data shown 

in Fig. 3, the intensity fluctuation of the multipass amplifier is greater than 100%.  There 

are some other sources,  which contribute to the  gain  fluctuation  of  multipass  amplifier, 

such  as  the  room  temperature  fluctuation,  etc.    Fig.  5  shows  the  output  of  mulitpass 

amplifier at a constant selected pulse rate in one hour, and there is an intensity fluctuation 

at a period of about 12 minutes.  This is consistent with the room temperature change in 

the laser room. 

Conclusion 

It  is  clear  that  the  existed  laser  system  for  TTF  photoinjector  at  Fermilab  needs  to  be 

improved in order to satisfy the requirements of producing high charge, high brightness 

and  bunch-to-bunch  stable  electron  beams.    The  gain  of  multipass  amplifier,  which  is 

higher  than  6000,  greatly  reduces  the  number  of  two-pass  amplifiers  and  simplifies  the 

laser system at Fermilab.  The drawback of multipass amplifier is that its gain fluctuation 

brings  an  exponential  increase  in  the  intensity  fluctuation  of  the  output  pulses.    Fast 

feedback control system needs to be installed to flashlamp-pumped amplifiers, especially 

multipass amplifier in the future in order to obtain the uniformity for all pulses in the 800 

µs pulse train and train-to-train stability.

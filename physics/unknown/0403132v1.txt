Abstract:  We  report  on  a  single-mode  photonic  crystal  fiber  with 
attenuation  and  effective  area  at  1550  nm  of  0.48  dB/km  and  130  µm2, 
respectively. This is, to our knowledge, the lowest loss reported for a PCF 
not  made  from  VAD  prepared  silica  and  at  the  same  time  the  largest 
effective area for a low-loss (< 1 dB/km) PCF. We briefly discuss the future 
applications of PCFs for data transmission and show for the first time, both 
numerically  and  experimentally,  how  the  group  velocity  dispersion  is 
related to the mode field diameter.

1. Introduction 

In  recent  years,  the  typical  attenuation  level  of  photonic  crystal  fibers  (PCFs)  has  been 
reduced  dramatically.  This  is  both  true  for  fibers  relying  on  index  guiding  [1-4]  as  well  as 
those based on the photonic bandgab effect [5], although the latter type still needs to improve 
with almost two orders of magnitude in order to have lower loss than the index guiding fibers.  
A few years back, the typical attenuation level for index guiding PCFs was a few dB/km 
at  1550  nm.  In  the  beginning  of  2002  the  1  dB/km  limit  was  reached  [1]  and  during  a 
relatively short period of time, this was improved to the current record level of 0.28 dB/km 
[4]. The most recent improvements have been obtained by using high purity glass prepared by 
the  vapour-phase  axial  deposition  (VAD)  technique  and  by  eliminating  the  presence  of  OH 
contamination. While these advances are indeed both significant and impressing, most of the 
fibers  reported  have  relative  small  effective  areas  no  larger  than  ~80  µm2  [4],  and  typically 
~20 µm2 [1-3]. Since the sensitivity towards attenuation caused by structural variations, both 
in  the  transverse  and  longitudinal  dimension  of  the  fiber,  increases  as  the  effective  area  is 
increased, it is interesting to hold up the effective area against the obtained attenuation level 
[6]. 

Here we present results on a low-loss PCF with an effective area significantly larger than 
that of previous reports. Also, we numerically investigate the relation between the mode-field 
diameter  (MFD)  and  the  group  velocity  dispersion  (GVD)  at  the  1550  nm  wavelength  and 
compare  the  obtained  results  with  measurements  performed  on  a  broad  range  of  PCFs  with 
widely  different  dimensions.  All  the  fibers  considered  here  are  index-guiding  PCFs  with  a 
cladding  region  consisting  of  a  triangular  arrangement  of  air  holes  running  along  the  full 
length of the fiber surrounding a central core region which is formed by omitting a single air 
hole.  
 

2. Fabricated fiber 

An optical micrograph of the fabricated PCF is shown in Fig. 1, indicating the fiber diameter, 
D = 173 µm, the air-hole diameter, d = 5.15 µm, and the pitch, Λ = 10.6 µm. The fiber has a 
single-layer acrylate coating (not shown) with a diameter of 315 µm. As seen from the picture, 
the  microstructured  cladding  region  consists  of  54  air  holes  corresponding  to  4  periods  of 
which the 6 holes in the corners of the outer ring have been omitted.

The  fiber  was  fabricated  by  the  stack  and  pull  method  where  capillary  tubes  made  of  pure 
silica  are  stacked  in  a  hexagonal  pattern  around  a  central  silica  rod.  The  surfaces  of  the 
elements were polished prior to stacking in order to reduce the influence of surface roughness 
[1].  The  raw materials  used  for  this  fiber were  commercially  available  silica  rods  and  tubes 
with a typical OH content in the order of ~0.5 ppm. 

The  spectral  attenuation  of  the  fiber  was  measured  by  the  cutback  technique  using  a 
white  light  source  and  an  optical  spectrum  analyzer.  The  fiber  length  used  for  this 
measurement was 2.5 km and the obtained attenuation spectrum is shown in Fig. 2 (left). In 
order to check for inhomogeneities, such as scattering points, along the fiber length, the fiber 
was  inspected  using  an  optical  time  domain  reflectometer  (OTDR)  with  an  operating 
wavelength of 1550 nm and pulse duration of 10 ns. The obtained OTDR trace is shown in 
Fig. 2 (right) as the black solid line. The red line, also shown in Fig. 2 (right), is the result of a 
linear regression on the measured data yielding a slope of -0.48 dB/km with a Pearson factor, 
R = -0.992, indicating a highly homogeneous fiber. The agreement between the attenuation at 
1550 nm obtained from the spectral measurements and from the OTDR is excellent and well 
within the measurement uncertainty. 

Analyzing  the  spectral  attenuation  data  shows  an  OH  induced  attenuation  peak  at  1380 
nm in the order of 20 dB/km corresponding to an OH concentration of ~0.4 ppm [7] and an 
attenuation  contribution  at  1550  nm  of  0.15  dB/km  [4].  This  is  in  good  agreement  with  the 
expected values from the raw materials. By extracting the λ-4 dependent scattering component, 
the  Rayleigh  scattering  coefficient  was  determined  to  be  1  dB/(km·µm4),  equivalent  to  a 
contribution of 0.18 dB/km at 1550 nm. The remaining 0.16 dB/km of the attenuation at 1550 
nm is attributed to the absorption from impurities and other imperfections. 

From d/Λ and Λ, the effective area of the fundamental mode is calculated  to be 130 µm2 
[8] which is equivalent to a Gaussian MFD of ~13 µm. This way of determining the MFD has 
proven to agree with measured data well within the typical  measurement uncertainty [9,10]. 
This is to our knowledge the largest effective area reported so far for a low loss (< 1dB km) 
PCF.  
 

3. Dispersion  

As the effective area is increased and the strength of the wave guiding decreases, the GVD is 
expected to approach that of the bulk material [10]. Since the waveguide contribution to the 
dispersion  is  always  positive  when  λ <<  Λ,  the  GVD  must  decrease  towards  the  material 
dispersion for increasing effective area.

the dashed line indicates DM. Measured values at 1550 nm for 8 different PCF are indicated by 
circles while the cross represents independent data from Ref. [4].  

 

By  using  the  plane-wave  expansion  method  [11],  the  effective  index,  n,  as  function  of  the 
free-space  optical  wavelength,  λ,  and  the  effective  area  of  the  fundamental  mode  was 
calculated for a range of d/Λ values from 0.40 to 0.60 covering the relevant parameter space 
for possible transmission fibers. In these numerical simulations, the refractive index of silica 
-1 with 
was taken to have a constant value of 1.444. The GVD is defined as the derivative of vg
respect to λ, where vg is the group velocity, and can therefore be calculated by the following 
relation where c is the speed of light and DM is the material dispersion:

In  this  expression  it  has  been  assumed  that  the  waveguide  contribution  to  the  GVD  is 
independent of DM which is a good approximation provided that λ << Λ [12].  The value of 
DM  for  pure  silica  at  1550  nm  was  calculated  from  the  Sellmeier  relation  [13]  to  be  21.9 
ps/(km·nm). In Fig. 3, the calculated GVD at 1550 nm is plotted as function of the MFD for 
d/Λ  =  0.40,  0.45,  0.50,  0.55,  and  0.60  indicated  by  solid  lines  while DM  is  indicated  by  the 
dashed horizontal line. As seen from this plot, all the solid curves coincide for MFDs larger 
than ~5 µm and the GVD is thus in this range given by the MFD regardless of the exact value 
of d/Λ. To verify whether the calculated relation corresponds with measurements, the group 
delay  as  function  of  wavelength  was  measured  for  a  broad  range  of  PCFs  with  widely 
different  MFDs  and  from  these  data  the  GVD  at  1550  nm  of  each  fiber  was  derived.  The 
measured fibers all had the same basic structure although the number of air holes varied from 
fiber to fiber. The MFDs of all the characterized fibers were calculated from the relation given 
in Ref. [8] and in Table 1, Λ, d/Λ, calculated MFD and measured GVD are listed. The number 
in the IDs refers to the approximate size of the core region. The measurements listed in Table 
1 are indicated in Fig. 3 by open circles and in general, excellent agreement with numerical 
results is observed with a typical deviation of 0.5 ps/(km·nm). The deviation for the LMA5 is 
seen to be slightly larger which is attributed to the exact determination of d/Λ which plays a 
role for this fiber only and, more importantly, to the fact that the assumption that λ << Λ is no 
longer  fulfilled.    The  data  point  in  Fig.  3  indicated  by  a  cross  represents  independent  data 
from Ref. [4] and also in this case the agreement is very good.

4. Discussion and conclusion 

The recent advances in the reduction of the attenuation level of index-guiding PCFs have left 
little doubt that these fibers, from an attenuation point of view, will be able to compete with 
conventional solid fibers for data transmission applications. One can even speculate that the 
ultimate  attenuation  level  of  the  PCF  might  be  even  lower  than  that  of  conventional  fibers 
since  the  PCF  is  a  single  material  fiber  with  no  boundary  between  two  types  of  glass  with 
different  thermal  expansion  coefficients.  However,  little  interest  has  until  now  been  paid 
towards the GVD properties of these fibers in the telecom window. As demonstrated here, the 
GVD  for  the  PCF  will  always  tend  to  have  a  higher  value  than  what  is  typical  for  a 
conventional  solid  fiber  with  comparable  MFD.  With  proper  dispersion  compensation,  this 
high  GVD  could  be  an  advantage  since  it  tends  to  suppress  nonlinear  interaction  between 
channels in multi-wavelength transmission systems [14] . 

The numerical results in Fig. 3 have a slight offset compared with the measured data in 
the order of 0.5 ps/(km·nm). Since this offset is independent of both the MFD and the GVD 
values,  we  attribute  this  to  a  corresponding  deviation  in  calculated  material  dispersion  from 
the actual material dispersion value of the glass. 

For sufficiently small MFDs, the GVD passes through zero and which has been used for 
realization of nonlinear fibers with zero dispersion at 1550 nm [15]. At some point, a further 
reduction of the structural scale, the mode will begin to expand relative to the structure and 
the MFD will increase. The simple behavior outlined here for large-mode area fibers should 
therefore not be extrapolated to nonlinear fibers.  

We have demonstrated a PCF with an effective area of 130µm2 and attenuation at 1550 
nm  of  0.48  dB/km  and  thereby  shown  that  PCFs  with  effective  areas  able  to  compete  with 
conventional  solid  fibers  can  be  obtained  while  keeping  the  attenuation  low.  A  significant 
contribution to this attenuation level was OH contamination present in the raw materials. We 
believe that the attenuation can be reduced close to the fundamental limit of pure silica while, 
at the same time, even larger effective areas than the one reported here, can be obtained.

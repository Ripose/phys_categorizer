In  the  NLC  project  multiple  bunches  of  electrons  and 
positrons  will  be  accelerated initially to a centre of mass 
of 500 GeV and later to 1 TeV or more.  In the process of 
accelerating 192 bunches within a pulse train, wakefields 
are  excited  which  kick  the  trailing  bunches  off  axis  and 
can cause luminosity dilution and BBU (Beam Break Up).  
Several  structures  to  damp  the  wakefield  have  been 
designed  and  tested  at  SLAC  and  KEK  and  these  have 
been  found  to  successfully  damp  the  wakefield  [1].  
However,  these  2π/3  structures  suffered  from  electrical 
breakdown  and  this  has  prompted  us  to  explore  lower 
group velocity structures operating at higher fundamental

amongst  the  bands  has  been  found  to  change  markedly 
with increased phase advance.  Here we report on general 
trends  in  the  kick  factor  and  associated  wakefield  band 
partitioning  in  dipole  bands  as  a  function  of  phase 
advance  of  the  synchronous  mode  in  linacs.      These 
results  are  applicable  to  both  TW  (travelling  wave)  and 
SW (standing wave) structures 

1.  INTRODUCTION 

The  initial  NLC/JLC  structures,  built  and  tested  at 
SLAC and KEK, were designed to accelerate electron and 
positron beams up to 0.5 TeV and up to 1.5 TeV in later 
upgrades.    In  order  to  efficiently  accelerate  the  charged 
particles, multiple bunches are accelerated within a pulse 
of the RF field and this requires loaded field gradients of 
the order of 70MV/m.   These accelerating structures were 
chosen to be 1.8 meters in length as this limits the number 
of  fundamental  and  higher  order  mode  couplers  needed 
per  structure.    The  dipole  mode  frequencies  of  these 
structures  were  detuned  in  order  to  ensure  destructive 
interference  of  dipole  wakefield  modes  excited  by  the 
beam.  The wakefield that is seen by bunches trailing the 
exciting  bunches  is  known  as  the  long-range  wakefield.  
The  wakefield  in  the  structure  DDS1  (Damped  Detuned 
Structure)  was  well-predicted  by  a  circuit  model  [2]  and 
subsequently measured in ASSET [3].  Further structures 
were fabricated and tested in which both the efficiency of 
transference  of  energy  to  the  electron  beam  and  the 
wakefield  damping  were  optimized.    However,  a  beam-
based  experiment  revealed  a  substantial  and  unpredicted 
phase  shift  of  the  accelerating  mode  along  the  structure.  
This  prompted  a  full  autopsy  of  the  structures  and  it 
revealed breakdown had been occurring and this had been 
concentrated  in  the  high  group  velocity  end  of  the 
structures.    This  has  led  to  a  series  of  new,  shorter,  low

group  velocity  test  structures  (the  “T”  series    [4])  which 
are constant gradient and are not provided with wakefield 
damping.    Recent  high  gradient  tests  performed  on  these 
structures  were  very  encouraging  as  the  breakdown  rates 
were  found  to  be  substantially  reduced.    We  have  two 
incorporate 
further  series  of  structures  which  will 
damping  of  the  dipole  modes:  SW  accelerators  which 
operate  in  the  π  mode  and  travelling  wave  accelerators 
which operate at a 5π/6 phase advance per cell.  

The  new  SW  structure  consists  of  15  cells  and  will 
eventually 
the  dipole 
incorporate  both  detuning  of 
frequencies  and  damping  of  the  wake  by  incorporating  a 
limited  number  of  choke  mode  cavities  in  the  structure 
[5].   The travelling wave structures are similar in design 
to the original DDS series except that they are shorter by a 
factor  of  up  to  3  and  they  accelerate  the  beam  with  a 
reduced  group  velocity  (3%  compared  to  12%  in  DDS).  
This  series  of  accelerator  structures  is  know  as  the  “H 
series”  because  they  operate  at  a  higher  phase  advance 
(5π/6  compared  to  2π/3)  which  is  needed  to  reduce  the 
group velocity whilst at the same time preserved the same 
average iris radius.    We maintain the average iris radius 
(radius/accelerating  mode  wavelength    =  a/λ  ~  0.18)  in 
order  to  keep  the  wakefield  along  the  bunch  (the  intra-
bunch or short range wake) to acceptable levels.  For the 
short  NLC  bunches  the  average  strength  of  the  slope  of 
the short-range wakefield is proportional to the -3.8 power 
of the iris radius. 
  A comparison of the dipole wakefield band structure for 
a  TW 2π/3 phase advance structure with a π  SW detuned 
structure  is  presented  in  the  following  section  and  the 
damping requirements that this requires are discussed.  In 
section 3 the general properties of band portioning of kick 
factors are presented.

TRANSVERSE WAKEFIELDS 
   The transverse wakefield excited by a particle beam can 
the  beam 
be  decomposed 
transversely to the axis of acceleration.  Here, we use an 
uncoupled analysis in which we calculate the wakefield at 
the  synchronous  frequency  using  the  individual  cell  kick 
factors. This analysis is valid to a good approximation for 
the first few meters behind the driving bunch.  At longer 
distances  a  coupled  mode  [6]  or  spectral  function  [7] 
analysis  must  be  used.    For  an  N-cell  accelerating 
structure  the  envelope  of  the  wakefield  at  a  distance  s 
behind the first bunch we derive as the absolute value of a 
summation:

Beam dynamics studies [11] indicate that the wakefield 
must be below unity in order that the BBU instability not 
be  an  issue.    The  wake  at  the  position  of  the  bunches  is 
shown in Fig 3 for the travelling wave structure and it is 
clear that the wake remains below unity at these locations 
and thus BBU is unlikely to be a problem.    The 3rd and 
6th  bands  have  significant  kick  factors  compared  to  the 
first band and these modes were detuned by enforcing and

wakefield  for  the  SW  structure  shown  in  Fig  4  reveals 
that  the  first  three  band  are  all  equally  important  and 
consequently  they  all  must  be  carefully  damped.    The 
wake  at  the  position  of  the  first  trailing  bunch  is  below 
unity  for  all  bands  apart  from  the  third  band.    The  third 
band  requires  additional  detuning  in  order  to  accelerate 
the rate of decay of the wake.

3. GENERAL PROPERTIES  
REGARDING BAND PARTITIONING  
OF KICK FACTORS 
In order to assess the behaviour of band partitioning as 
a function of synchronous frequency we used the Fortran 
code Transvrs [12] driven with by a Mathematica input to 
the data set to calculate the kick factors and synchronous 
frequencies.    The results of this calculation are shown in 
Fig 5 for a/λ given by 0.229 (a), 0.19 (b) and 0.161 (c), in 
which the kick factors are calculated for structures with a 
phase  advance  ranging  from  120  to  180  degrees.    The 
general  trend  for  the  first  three  bands  is  quite  clear, 
namely,  rather  independently  of  the  iris  dimension,  the 
second and third dipole bands are enhanced at the expense 
of  the  first  band  as  the  phase  advance  per  cell  increases 
from the initial value of 2π/3.  The effect of finite group 
velocity  on  the  kick  factor  has  been  left  to  a  later 
publication  as  until  recently  the  code  was  unable  to 
incorporate  this  effect.    However,  inclusion  of  the  finite 
group  velocity  does  not  modify  our  general  conclusions 
on the partitioning of modes. 

In conclusion, the present NLC design limits a/λ ~0.18 
and thus the first three bands of the SW structure will be 
required to be damped and detuned. For the 5π/6 structure 
only  the  first  dipole  bands  must  be  damped  and  the  cell 
frequencies  detuned  together  with  the  third  band  which 
will be required to be detuned and moderately damped or 
not  damped  at  all.    Further  studies  are  in  progress  on 
assessing the damping requirements of the 3rd dipole band 
in the 5π/6 structure.

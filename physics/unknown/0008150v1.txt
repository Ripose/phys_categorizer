Abstract

We  present  the  first  time  resolved  OTR  angular
distribution measurements of an  intense  pulsed  electron
beam  (1.7 kA,  60 ns).  These  initial  experiments  on  the
first axis of the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydro-Testing
(DARHT) facility and subsequent  analysis,  demonstrate
the possibility to extract, from  the  data,  the  energy  and
the divergence angle of a 3.8 and 20 MeV electrons.

1  INTRODUCTION

By using the OTR angular distribution property [1], it
is  possible  to  extract  the  energy  and  the  angular
dispersion  of  several  kinds  of  beam  [2].  Recently,  Le
Sage  et  al.  [3]  succeeded  in  producing  a  transverse
phase-space  mapping  of  a  100 MeV  electron  beam  by
coupling  an  interferometric  measurement  and  a  ’’mask’’
technique.  We  present  the  first  OTR  time  resolved
angular  distribution  measurements  made  on  an  intense
pulsed electron beam with energies of 3.8 and 20 MeV.

The  DARHT  accelerator  produces  an  intense  pulsed
electron beam (1.7 kA, 20 MeV, 60 ns) that impinges on
a  high-Z  target.  The  quality  of  the  X-ray  source  is
determined  by  spot  size  and  dose.  The  spot  size  is
effected  by  magnet  focal  length,  emittance,  energy
spread  and  beam  motion.  The  dose  is  determined  by
beam  energy, 
target  material,  and
convergence  angle.  We  present  results  of  OTR  angular
distribution  experiments  performed  at  3.8  and  20 MeV
electron beam energies on the first axis of DARHT and
compare  these  results  to  a  3D  Ray-Tracing  program
which  is  able  to  calculate  the  effect  of  each  electron
beam parameter. Comparison shows that the data is most
sensitive

2  OTR ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS

2.1  OTR properties

OTR  is  produced  when  a  charged  particle  passes
between  media  with  different  dielectric  constants  as  a
aluminium  foil  in  vacuum.  This  light  is  emitted  with  a
characteristic  angular  distribution  that  depends  of  the
particle energy and direction. The Fig. 1 shows the OTR
density  versus  angle  on  the  incidence  plane  (plane
defined  by  the  beam  axis  and  the  normal  vector  of  the
target).  The  zero  angle  corresponds  to  the  “specular”
direction.

plane for two different energy (the tilt angle of the

foil is 45 degree).

It is important to note that the light produced by OTR

is distributed with two different polarizations.

2.2  Ray-Tracing program

The system composed of the beam, the OTR foil and
the detection system has 3D geometry. We developed a
Ray-Tracing  program  able  to  follow  photons  produced
by  each  electron  of  a  phase-space-defined  beam.  The
code  calculates  the  image  received  by  the  screen  for
each  polarisation.  For  a  simulation,  a  spectrum  range,
foil  material,  lens  and  screen  size  and  position  and  the
tilt  angle  of  the  target  are  chosen.  The  results  obtained
are absolute as shown in Fig. 1.

2.3  Experimental set-up

 The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 2.

 

Figure 2: Experimental set-up for angular

distribution measurement.

 The  electron  beam  passes  through  a  thin  aluminised
Kapton  foil  (10  microns)  and  produces  OTR  photons
from  the  aluminium-vacuum  interface.  This  target  is
tilted 45 degrees so the center of the OTR distribution is
emitted  at  90  degrees  from  the  beam  axis.  The  OTR
light is collected by an achromatic doublet (focal length
=  200 mm  and  effective  diameter  =  70 mm)  which
produces  an  angular  image  of  the  source  on  a  screen.
This geometry requires the distance between the lens and
the screen to be equal to  the  focal  length.  The  distance
between the target and the lens determine the maximum
collection angle of the system. Limitations are the screen
size, the "Cherenkov" background created inside the lens
by secondary electrons or X-rays and discoloration of the
optics  caused  by  radiation  damage.  A  200-mm  focal
length achromatic lens that gives a maximum collection
angle  of  170 mrad  is  used.  A  polarizer  can  be  added
between  the  lens  and  the  screen  to  separate  each
polarisation. An 8-frame gated camera records the image
formed on the screen. This device splits the light up to 8
different  micro-channel  plate  (MCP)  gated  CCD.  The
gating system of each MCP makes it possible  to  record
each image with a 10 nanoseconds duration.

 This optical system is to first order independent of the
beam size and position. However, with large angle of the
OTR  lobe  (specially  at  low  energy),  a  large  beam  size
can affect the angular distribution. In this case, a precise
analysis with the Ray-Tracing program is required.

2.4  OTR confirmation

 To  confirm  that  OTR  is  the  main  part  of  the  light
collected by the system as opposed to prompt Cherenkov
light generated by X-rays or secondary electrons, initial
measurements  were  made  of  the  polarization  of  light
from 
images
corresponding  to  (a)  both  polarizations  (no  polarizer),

polarisation. The beam energy is 3.8 MeV

 These  pictures  demonstrate  that  the  light  observed  is
OTR. A second test was to block the light coming from
the target by placing a thin aluminium foil between the
target and the lens. The result confirms the low ratio of
the  “Cherenkov”  light  coming  from  the  target.  Tests
were made at both 3.8 MeV and 20 MeV.

2.5  Extraction of beam parameters

 According  to  the  3D  model  of  OTR,  a  horizontal
(vertical)  cut  of  the  picture  recorded  gives  information
about  the  beam.  Results  indicate  that  the  distance
between  the  maximum  positions  is  determined  by  the
energy  and  the  filling  at  the  centre  is  most  sensitive  to
beam  envelope  divergence/convergence  angle  at  the
detector.

 By  changing  the  current  on  the  guiding  solenoid
before the OTR foil, the beam size and divergence angle
are varied. The Fig. 4 shows the effect predicted by the
simulations.  These  curves  correspond  to  the  full  beam
duration and they are normalised.

These  results  are  in  agreement  with  the  simulations.
The precision on the energy measurement for these data
is 250 keV at 20 MeV and 150 keV at 15 MeV.

2.6  Time resolved measurement

Fig.  7  is  an  example  of  a  time  resolved  result.  The
beam  energy  is  constant  through  the  pulse.  Therefore,
we  can  observe  the  beam  divergence/convergence  as  a
function of time. For this measurement, the vacuum was
reduced  to  3.10-5 Torr  to  initiate  a  time  dependent
focusing  of 
to  background  gas
neutralization. This effect is, also, observed in the spatial
measurement.  This  effect  disappears  then  the  vacuum
reach  5.10-6 Torr.  These  results  need  to  be  improved.
Currently, they show a time variation of the divergence
angle about 5 mrad.

2.7  Discussion and perspectives

 If  the  system  is  carefully  aligned  and  the  maximum
angle collected is more  than  four  times  1/γ,  each  beam
parameter can be consider independent.  If  not,  they  are
linked  and  a  direct  comparison  with  different
simulations is necessary. We found this complication at
3.8 MeV with our set-up.

After 

these  measurements,  we  plan  different
amelioration. First of all, the CCD dynamic range must
be  improved  (256  to  64k  levels).  There  are  calibration
concerns  associated  with  the  8  different  CCD  camera
that  need  to  be  addressed  before  we  can  extract
quantitative information from the images. Next, we will
use  a  streak  camera  image  a  slice  of 
the  OTR
distribution  directly  as  a  function  of  time.  Also,  the
magnification  of  the  OTR  angular  distribution  image
must  be  increase  to  obtain  a  better  definition  of  the
maximum and the centre.

CONCLUSION

The results presented here prove that it is  possible  to
use the OTR angular distribution information to measure
the  energy  and  divergence/convergence  angle  of  an
intense  pulsed  electron  beam.  The  light  intensity  is
sufficient  for 
these
parameters in the 3.8-20 MeV energy range.

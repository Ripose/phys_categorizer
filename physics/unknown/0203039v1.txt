ABSTRACT 
 
We study experimentally the dynamical and decay properties of the Stimulated Nutation Echo 

(SNE) in a two-level spin system. This is the signal which appears in the transient response of 
the system to  the second pulse at time t 1 elapsed from its beginning and coinciding with the 

duration of the first pulse. The information about the first pulse duration is imprinted into the 

population difference of the inhomogeneously broadened ensemble of the two-level 

absorbers. The decay of the SNE signal has two contributions. One originates from the 

population decay during the time ô between the pulses. Another is caused by the coherence 

loss during the excitation by the first pulse and the reading time of the second pulse. 

Experimental results on the decay properties induced by these mechanisms are presented. The 

dependence of these decay rates on the pulse intensity is discussed, and its relationship with 

the anomalous (non-Bloch) decay of other coherent transients in solids is examined.

I. INTRODUCTION 

When a system of two-level centers (atoms or spins) is resonantly driven by the sequence of 
two pulses, lasting t 1 and t 2 and separated by the interpulse distance t , the response of the 
system to the second pulse (t > t 1 +t )  includes both an initial Rabi-oscillating component and 
an oscillatory echo, centered at t = 2t 1 +t , namely at a time distance t 1 from the onset of the 

second pulse. This echo effect is an example of forced echo, in the sense that it occurs during 

the refocusing pulse and is emitted by a strongly driven rather than by a freely evolving 

system. The nutation echo effect originates from the fact that, at the beginning of the second 

(refocusing) pulse, the system is far from its thermal equilibrium state, as its population 

difference and its coherences keep memory of the time evolution during the first (preparative) 

pulse. The non-thermal initial state causes a revival of Rabi oscillations during the second 

pulse.  

Nutation echo was proposed in optical domain in 1979 [1]. Then it was observed in 

NMR systems [2, 3] and in ESR systems [4-6]. It was studied theoretically and 

experimentally in great detail in the NMR domain [3], under the name of two-pulse delayed 

nutation echo. This name was given to emphasize that the delayed nutation used in optical 

domain for measuring T1-relaxation [7] is the echo phenomenon missed in those experiments  

because of the poor resolution of the optical detector. It was mentioned as driven echo in a 

recent review paper [8].  In 1997 the most advanced theory of the echo along with 

experiments in the optical domain was presented in [9-10] by A. Szabo et al. It is worth 

noting that in the echo effect considered here the phase coherence and shift between the two 

exciting pulses is not relevant; in this respect, it is different from the spin and optical rotary 

echo [11], from nutation time-reversal experiments [12], and from coherent echoes excited by 

field gradients sequences in NMR imaging [13].   

In this paper the nutation echo is investigated in electron spin resonance systems, at 

microwave frequency, and in such conditions that it originates only from the spectral pattern 

of the population difference stored in the inhomogeneous spectrum of the system at the end of 

the first pulse. Following ref. [9,10] we will refer to it as Stimulated Nutation Echo (SNE), in 

analogy to the three-pulse-stimulated echo that is produced from a hole pattern burnt into an 

inhomogeneous line. At variance to previous observations of SNE in ESR systems, obtained 

either in spin systems generated by pulsed light irradiation [4], or by indirect optical detection 

[5], or by applying Zeeman field pulses [6], in our experiments the SNE is directly excited by 

pulses of resonant radiation. This configuration yields a higher value of the signal-to-noise 

2 

ratio, even with respect to previously reported detection in NMR [2,3]  and optical systems 

[9,10]. 

 In particular we report experimental results on the decay properties of the SNE signal. 

The SNE intensity is expected to decrease on increasing the interpulse distance t , due to 

thermalization of the population difference pattern. According to conventional Bloch 

Equations, this decay should proceed at the rate T1
. On the other hand, the SNE intensity is 
expected to decrease as well on increasing the duration t 1 of the first (exciting) pulse, due to 

-1

the coherence loss mechanisms. The latter is a major interest point, if one considers that the 

anomalous decay of the coherent transients in solids is still a matter of debate.   

In this regard we recall that the main anomalies found experimentally concern the free-

induction decay (FID) [14-19], the hole burning [20] and the Transient Nutation regime 

[21,22]. The anomalous decay of  FID (strongly related to the anomalous width of the hole 

burnt in the inhomogeneous line) was ascribed to the excitation power dependence of the 

atomic coherence decay rate. In fact, the experimental results suggest that the actual width of 

the burnt hole is much less than the value expected on the basis of the conventional Bloch 

Equations ~

1 / TTc

, where c is the driving field Rabi frequency, T1 is a population decay 

time and T2 is the coherence decay time. In several theoretical papers [23-34] (the list is not 

exhaustive) it was assumed that the dephasing interactions, responsible for the coherence loss, 

are averaged out by the fast Rabi oscillations of the atom between the ground and excited 

states, causing T2 to tend to T1 and the spectral narrowing of the hole. 

However,  the direct measurement of coherence loss during the resonant excitation, 

carried out using the Transient Nutation regime,  revealed the opposite effect, i.e. that the 

decay rate becomes higher on increasing the driving field amplitude [21,22]. Recent theories 

[32-34], based on the model of the field-driven relaxation, have been proposed to describe 

both decay anomalies in the saturation and in the coherent regime.  

 

The paper is organized as follows. In Sect.II we briefly outline the theory of the SNE 

by Shakhmuratov [9], specializing it to the specific system considered here, to calculate the 

intensity and the shape of the SNE and its decay properties, hypothesizing the 

phenomenological Bloch times T1 and T2. In Sect. III we report the experimental results 

obtained in our ESR system and we compare it with the solutions of the Bloch Equations and 

with the anomalous decay of the Transient Nutations.

II. 

THEORY 

      In this section we give a brief and simplified sketch of the theory of the SNE presented in 

ref. [9]. The ensemble of the two-level particles with inhomogeneously broadened absorption 

line is excited at the line center by the sequence of two pulses of resonant radiation at 
frequency W

, of the duration t 1 and  t 2, separated by t . The evolution of the resonant and non 

resonant spins is governed by the Bloch Equations:

, w0 is the equilibrium population 

difference. T1 and T2 are the decay times of the population difference and of the coherence, 

with T1>>T2. The Rabi frequency c is defined by the transition matrix element and the 

amplitude of the driving field. The parameter 

=D w

 is the detuning of the generic packet 

(centered at w) from the resonance and from the line center.  

The transient solutions of Eqs.(1-3) were derived by Torrey [35]. They simplify if we 

assume the strong field limit (

) and that the first pulse duration t 1 is much shorter 

1

than T1, so that only T2 affects the time evolution of the system during the pulse. Both 

conditions are well satisfied in our experimental situation. After the preparation pulse, the 

population difference of the particles is left perturbed:

. The spectral pattern given in Eq.(4) is the 

ultimate origin of the echo effect we are concerned with. In Figure 1, we report a typical 

spectral pattern of the population difference, as obtained from Eq.(4), and hypothesizing a 
Gaussian inhomogeneous lineshape with standard deviation s

. As shown, at the end of the 

first pulse, w(D) is strongly modulated inside a region of width c around the excitation point 

(the line center in our case). Obviously, the particular pattern depends both on c and on t1 : on 

increasing c this region broadens and on increasing 

1t  the peaks become closer and closer.

A typical result of the SNE signal, as calculated using Eq. (9), is reported in the inset of Fig.1. 

The signal consists of  an oscillatory pattern with many spikes of alternating sign. The peak 

values are distributed inside a symmetric bell-shaped envelope centered at  t = t1 . The  

analytical study carried out in Ref.[9] shows that the spikes occur at 

=

, where the 

sequence ti is given in units of the Rabi period T0 as ti /T0 =0.17; 0.65; 1.24; 1.74; 2.24, etc.  

The amplitudes of the spikes decrease as ti increases. Vecho is exactly zero at t =t1 . 

            The SNE becomes pronounced if the first pulse area 

 is at least several ð. 

q =

Otherwise it is impossible to isolate the echo signal from the transient nutations excited by the 

second pulse,  given by the first term in Eq.(7). 

 

In particular, when varying the relevant time parameters of the exciting sequence, 

1t  

and t , the amplitudes Vm of the peaks nearest to the center (

(10) 

Eq.(10) describes the decay dynamics of the SNE, as expected from the conventional Bloch 

Equations. In particular, the SNE is expected to decay on increasing the interpulse distance t 

at a rate  fixed by the spin relaxation time T1. However, this decay can be much faster, due to 

the spectral diffusion, which tends to smear out the distribution of the population difference 

depicted in Fig.1.  

On the other hand, the SNE echo is expected to decay as well as a function of t1  as a 

single exponential at the rate 1/T2, independent of c. In this regard we remark that this 

expectation is not conditioned by the approximation used for a2. In fact, by numerically 

integrating Eq.(7) using the D-dependent expression of a2,  we verified that the only effect of 
the approximation a

2 = 1 is to overestimate the decay rate (by nearly 10%), in the sense 

1 = a

that the actual rate is 1.13/T2 rather than 1/T2. What is important for our present concern, is 

that the single-exponential nature of the decay and the c-independence of the rate are 

properties of  the exact solution of the Bloch Equations. This is the relevant reason of interest 

in this coherent regime. In fact, the decay of the SNE as a function of t1  should manifest the 

processes of coherence loss in the strongly driven system. As mentioned in the previous

Bloch Equations. This has been already observed in connection with the Transient Nutation 

regime and a similar effect is expected to occur for the SNE.  

 

III.  EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION 

For the experimental investigation of the SNE in magnetic resonance systems we used 

the method of the two-photon (TP)-excitation-Second-Harmonic (SH)-detection, already 

successfully employed for several transient regimes [15, 17, 21]. In our experimental 
apparatus, the spin system, tuned to the frequency w
static magnetic field Bo, is excited by an intense microwave radiation at frequency w

o/2p

o (w

 = 5.95 GHz) by the external 

 = w

o/2, 

which couples the spin states by TP transitions. The TP-induced coherences manifest in the 
build-up of a transverse magnetization, M^ (2w

), oscillating at  the SH of the driving field. The 

response of the spin system is monitored by revealing the radiation emitted by the spin system 
. Under pulse excitation conditions, the amplitude M^  of  M^ (2w
at frequency 2w

) varies in 

time, reproducing the coherent transient regimes  of the spin system. At the exact TP- tuning, 

 = w

o/2 , M^  is proportional to V(t) and is the same as for the usual single-quantum 

excitation, if the appropriate TP-induced Rabi frequency c

 is used [36]. We refer to our 

previous papers [15, 17, 21] for the detailed description of this procedure and of the related 

experimental apparatus.  

The experiments described below were carried out, at T= 4.2 K, using a sample of 

glassy SiO2, containing a concentration c ~ 2.4 1017 spin/cm 3 of E’ centers [37], preliminarily 

generated by exposure to gamma rays [38]. E’ centers have S=1/2 and are particularly suitable 

for this kind of experiments for their relatively long relaxation times. In our work conditions, 
we measured T1 = 1.2 s  (by the saturation recovery method) and T2 = 75 m s (by the spin echo 

method). In the glassy matrix of SiO 2, E’ centers exhibit a powder-like line shape. For the 

purposes of the experiments described below, the central part of their resonance line is well 
approximated by a Gaussian shape with s

~ 1 MHz. 

/2p

The spin system, tuned at resonance, is excited by a sequence of two pulses, lasting 

 
t1 and t2   respectively, separated by a distance t , both with the same power level. The 
repetition frequency is kept low enough (typically 0.5 Hz) to ensure complete thermal 

relaxation of the spin system between successive sequences. The microwave signal emitted by 

the spin system and output by the cavity has a time-dependent amplitude M^  (t), which we

. To improve the 

During the first pulse, the system undergoes damped Rabi oscillations, which we use 

for the accurate measure of c

. A typical response to the second pulse is shown in Fig.2, as 

 = 200 kHz, t1 =30 m s (t1  »

 6 To) and t  = 400 m s ( t  >> T2). At the onset of 

the second pulse, the system undergoes fast-damping Rabi oscillations, followed by the SNE 
regime. The SNE signal consists of a bell-enveloped series of peaks at the Rabi frequency c
, 
centred at te = 30m s (te = t1 ) after the onset of the second pulse, in agreement with theoretical 
predictions. 

 

In order to explore a wide range of c

, t1  and t , where the SNE signal is nearly at the 
noise level, we often used a sort of homodyne detection . The microwave signal output by the 

cavity is firstly superimposed to an equal-frequency reference signal , whose amplitude and 

phase are adjusted to ensure the maximum visibility of  SNE oscillations. The sum signal is 

then revealed by a conventional superheterodyne detector, yielding S2(t) = M^

2 + R2 +2 M^ R, 

where R is the amplitude of the reference signal. The result is shown in the inset of Fig. 2. 

Note that, usually R2>>M^

2, so that S2 = R2 + 2M^ R consists of a d.c. offset and a time 

dependent part following the time evolution of M^  (t), coherently amplified by R. To estimate 

the SNE intensity IE, we determine the maximum and the minimum signals nearest to the echo

The detailed timing of the SNE signal is shown in Fig. 3 where we report an expanded 
view of a typical curve of the SNE signal, taken with a Rabi frequency c = 100 kHz and ô1 = 
55 m s. In the figure the time origin is placed at 55 m s after the onset of the second pulse and 

we observe maxima and minima symmetrically located around the origin at times ti , that in 
units of the Rabi period T0 are:  ti/T0= 0.25; 0.72; 1.23; 1.74; and 2.27 (–

 0.02, typically), in 

fair agreement with the theoretical values:  0.17; 0.65; 1.24; 1.74; 2.24.  

 

The echo intensity IE is expected to decrease on increasing the interpulse distance t , 

because of the progressive smearing of the population pattern stored in the longitudinal 

component of the magnetization. According to the conventional Bloch Equations the decay is 
 [Eq.(10)]. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 4, 

expected to proceed at the rate 1/T1
where the intensity IE is reported as a function of t , for various values of c

. As shown, the 

decay is not a single exponential and occurs in a time scale of a few ms, to be compared to the 

8 

much longer value of T1 (~
on decreasing c

 1.0 s). Moreover, the decay depends on c

, being faster and faster 

; on the other hand, apart from the obvious scale factor, the decay curves are 

essentially independent on the first pulse duration t1 .  

  

The spectral diffusion (SD) may be the origin of so fast a decay. In fact the migration  

of the excitations over the whole resonance line may affect the persistence of the population 

spectral pattern stored during the first pulse. The SD process is usually faster than spin-lattice 

relaxation and may be the dominant cause of echo decay. In this regard we note that the 

excitation by the first pulse is spectrally selective in two aspects. On the one hand it involves 
only a narrow part of the resonance line (with a width of the order of c

 << s ). This situation is 

usually described in terms of A-type  (echo-active) spins and B-type (the others) spins [39]. 

The dipolar interaction A-B drags spin excitations away from the line centre and causes the 
decay of the echo. On increasing c

, the number of A-type spins increases with respect to B-

type spins; this circumstance may account for the slower decay of the echo at high c

, 

experimentally observed.  On the other hand, the first pulse excitation is spectrally selective 

also within the A-type spin group. In fact it establishes a comb  population pattern (Fig.1) 

within the central part of the line, which is the true source of the SNE formation. So, one 

expects that the A-A dipolar interaction may smear this pattern and yield an additional 

contribution to the echo decay. The population pattern is finer and finer on increasing t1 , with 

higher spectral gradients of the population difference. So one expects this contribution to the 

decay rate to increase on increasing t1 . The experimental results suggest that the former effect 

(due to A-B interaction)  is predominant.  

The echo intensity IE is expected to decay as well on increasing the first pulse duration 
 and t , due to the coherence loss occurring during both pulses, for a 

 
t1 , while keeping fixed c
total time span 2t1 . The experimental results are reported in Fig.5, where we report the echo 

intensity IE, measured as described above, as a  function of t1 , for three different values of the 
Rabi frequency c
interpulse distance t . In the same figure we report also the decay function, as predicted by the 

, 50 kHz, 100 kHz and 200 kHz. These results are unaffected by the 

solutions of the conventional Bloch Equations: according to Eq.(10), the decay of the echo 
intensity near the centre (t »

 t1 ) should follow a single exponential law with the rate T2

-1.  We 

note that the experimental decay is well described by a single exponential but proceeds at a 

rate faster than T2

-1 and power-dependent.  The experimental dependence of  G E on c is 

reported  in Fig. 6. As shown, it is well described by a linear law and is compatible with the

 tending to zero. By fitting we get G E = a

 + b

, with a

/2p

 = (1.0 –

 0.2) kHz  

The c -dependence of the experimental rate G E of the SNE decay is reminiscent of the 

non-Bloch decay of the Transient Nutation regime, already observed in the same system for 
single pulse excitation. In those experiments it was found that the decay rate G T N of TN tends 
to (2T2 )-1 in the limit of very low power but increases linearly with c
reported here show that the decay rate G E of the SNE follows a qualitatively similar 

. The experiments 

behaviour, confirming that the coherence loss effect of strongly driven systems is not 

adequately described by the Bloch model.  

In the inset of the figure, for the sake of comparison, we report the experimental c -
dependence of the G T N as measured in the same sample and well fitted by the linear law G TN = 

 + b ’c

 with b ’= (10.6 –

 0.5) 10-2. So, the two behaviours are similar, but the slopes are 
different, in the sense that the c -sensitivity of  G E seems to be less than G T N. A qualitative 

reason for this difference may be found recalling the origin of the anomalous decay of the 

coherent transient regime. As discussed in [32, 34], the anomalous behaviour of the coherence 

loss rate may be ascribed to the modifications of the dipolar field caused by the resonant 
interaction with the microwave field, which yields a linear dependence of the rate G T N on c. 

Obviously, the same mechanism is expected to be effective also during the second refocusing 

pulse. However, the effect may be less due to the population spectral pattern which reduces 

the number of the spins involved in the echo formation  with respect to those involved in the 

Transient Nutation regime, thus lessening the part of the dipolar interaction modified by the 

resonant field. 

 

IV. 

CONCLUSION 

In conclusion, we have reported experimental results on the SNE in electron spin 

resonance systems. The timing and the shape of the echo pattern appear in agreement with the 

theory by Szabo and Shakhmuratov [9]. We have investigated the decay properties of the 

echo and found that the decay is strongly affected by the spectral diffusion mechanism; our 

results are consistent with the prevalence of the A-B interaction over the A-A. Moreover, we 

studied the effect of the coherence loss during the exciting and the refocusing pulses. Our 

results evidence a non-Bloch behaviour similar to that observed in other coherent regimes 

which we tentatively ascribe to the field-induced modification of the dipolar field. This may 

be the origin as well of the different power dependence of coherence loss rate measured in the 

10 

c
a
simple Transient Nutation regime and in the SNE regime. In this regard we note that the 
experimental study of the SNE echo excited by two pulses with different c

 may yield further 

information. Work is in progress in this direction.

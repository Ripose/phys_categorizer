Abstract 

In search for efficient electrocatalysts for the oxidation of L-cysteine on glassy carbon, multi-

vanadium-substituted  polyoxometalates  (POMs,  for  short)  were  tested.  The  electrochemical 
behaviours  of  the  sandwich-type  complex  [As2W18(VO)3Ο66]11-  were  studied  in  a  pH  7 

medium and compared with those of the three following Dawson-type vanadium-substituted 
complexes: [P2V2W16O62]8- (P2V2W16), [P2MoV2W15O62]8- (P2MoV2W15) and [P2V3W15O62]9- 
(P2V3W15). Electrochemistry shows that the sandwich-type POM contains 2 VIV centers and 
IVVW18, in agreement with titration, elemental 
one VV center and  must be formulated As2V2

analysis and magnetic measurements on this element. The two-electron composite wave that 
features  the  redox  behaviour  of  the  two  VIV  centers  of  As2V2
IVVW18  are  very  close  to  each 

other  and  remains  practically  merged  whatever  the  potential  scan  rate.  In  addition  of  this 
sharp contrast with the behaviours of the two VV centers of P2V2W16 or P2MoV2W15, the very 

slow  electron  transfer  kinetics  associated  with  the  second  wave  of  P2V3W15  appears  also  at 
IVVW18. All the POMs of this work proved efficient for the 

variance with the case of As2V2

oxidation  of  L-cysteine.  Comparison  of  the  present  results  with  those  of  mono-Vanadium 

substituted POMs indicates that accumulation of vanadium atoms in the POM framework is 

beneficial  in  the  electrocatalytic  process.  In  addition,  the  present  work  highlights  the 

important influence of the POM structure in the electrocatalytic oxidation of L-cysteine. The 

remarkable  outcome  of  this  work  is  that  the  potential  for  the  oxidation  of  L-cysteine  in  the 

presence  of  the  selected  POMs  has  been  substantially  driven  in  the  negative  direction 

compared to the case of glassy carbon alone, a feature which is associated with faster kinetics. 

The stability of the systems must also be pointed out.

1. Introduction 

L-cysteine  is  recognized  as  one  of  the  most  important  among  marker  thiols  in  biological 

systems [1-4]. It is used in medicine and food industries. As a consequence, its oxidation and 

accurate determination at low potential constitute a valuable task and the search for sensitive 

and  selective  methods  in  these  purposes  continues  unabated  [1-4].  In  this  context, 

electrochemical techniques at solid electrodes appear among the favourites, probably because, 

simultaneously with detection, they provide interesting insights into the redox behaviours of 

cysteine.  Unfortunately,  direct  oxidation  of  thiols  including  cysteine,  at  classical  solid 

electrodes  surfaces  (Pt,  Au,  Graphite,  Carbon)  is  kinetically  slow  and  requires  a  large 

overpotential  to  be  effective.  Hence  the  necessity  to  study  electrocatalytic  processes  that 

might  decrease  the  overpotential  [1-13].  Also  associated  with  this  strategy  are  several  other 

beneficial improvements including the increase in selectivity, the decrease of surface fouling 

and  the  decrease  of  surface  oxide  formation.  Remarkable  achievements  were  obtained 

recently  with  boron-doped  diamond  electrodes  [2,7,11]  and  also  with  carbon  nanotube 

materials, unmodified or modified with various catalysts [1-3,9].    

We now report multi-vanadium-substituted polyoxometalates (POMs)  which act as mediators 

to  improve  the  electro-oxidation  of  cysteine  on  glassy  carbon  electrodes  (GC).  Bare  carbon 

electrodes, including bare glassy carbon, show a very slow kinetics for this process [4,14]. To 
our  knowledge,  as  concerns  POMs,  only  [CoIIIW12O40]5-  was  used  to  oxidize  cysteine  in 
aqueous  acidic  media  [15],  but  the  formal  potential  of  the  CoIII  /  CoII  couple  within  this 

molecule is more positive than + 0.7 V vs SCE. All the selected vanadium-substituted POMs 
are stable in a large pH domain from 0 to 8; furthermore, solutions of their oxidized (VV) and 
reduced  (VIV)  forms  are  stable  in  the  open  air.  These  classical  complexes  of  the    Dawson 
series  ([P2V2W16O62]8-  (P2V2W16)  and  [P2MoV2W15O62]8-  (P2MoV2W15)  and  [P2V3W15O62]9- 

(P2V3W15))  proved  efficient  previously  in  the  electrocatalytic  reduction  of  NO  and  the 

oxidation  of  coenzymes  like  NAD(P)H  [16].  They  are  sufficiently  powerful  oxidants  to 

oxidize  L-cysteine.  Additionally,  one  sandwich-type  POM  was  used,  of  formula 
[As2W18(VO)3Ο66]11- (As2V3W18) [17]. The formal potentials of all these POMs are lower by 
0.3 to 0.4 V than that of the CoIII/CoII couple within [CoIIIW12O40]5-.

General  Methods  and  Materials.  Pure  water  was  used  throughout.  It  was  obtained  by 

passing  through  a  RiOs  8  unit  followed  by  a  Millipore-Q  Academic  purification  set.  All 

reagents were  of  high-purity grade and were used as purchased without  further  purification. 

The  UV-visible  spectra  were  recorded  on  a  Perkin-Elmer  Lambda  19  spectrophotometer  on 
1.6x10-5 M solutions of the relevant polyanion. Matched 1.000 cm optical path quartz cuvettes 

were  used.  The  compositions  of  the  various  media  were  as  follows:  for  pH  4  and  5:  1  M 

CH3COONa  +  CH3COOH  ;  for  pH  7:  1  M  NaCl  +  50  mM  NaH2PO4  +  NaOH;  or  0.5  M 

Li2SO4 + 0.2 M Tris + H2SO4. 

Electrochemical Experiments. The same media as for UV-visible spectroscopy were 

 
used for electrochemistry, but the polyanion concentration was 2x10-4 M.  

The solutions were thoroughly deaerated with pure argon for at least 30 min. and kept under a 

positive pressure of this gas during the experiments. The source, mounting and polishing of 

the glassy carbon (GC, Tokai, Japan) electrodes has been described [18]. The glassy carbon 

samples had a diameter of 3 mm. The electrochemical set-up was an EG & G 273 A driven by 

a  PC  with  the  M270  software.  Potentials  are  quoted  against  a  saturated  calomel  electrode 

(SCE).  The  counter  electrode  was  a  platinum  gauze  of  large  surface  area.  All  experiments 

were performed at room temperature. 

Upon addition of a small amount of cysteine to one of the selected POMs with its V-center(s) 
in the oxidised form, the colour associated with VIV develops immediately, thus indicating the 

reduction  of  the  POM.  The  appropriate  amount  of  cysteine  was  added  until  complete 

reduction  of  the  POM,  as  followed  by  UV-visible  spectroscopy.Such  a  procedure  is 

interesting  in  that  it  provides  a  stoichiometry  for  the  cysteine/POM  reaction  and  indicates 

simultaneously the reduced POM to remain stable in the reaction medium. It was also checked 

that this reduction could be obtained by controlled potential electrolysis of the POM alone. In 

the following, electrocatalysis experiments will be started with the relevant V-center(s) in the 

reduced  state.  AN  analogous  procedure  was  used  previously  in  the  study  of  the 

electrocatalytic oxidation of NADH by selected POMs [19].

3. Results and Discussion 

Dawson-type POMs. 

3.1.  Electrocatalysis  of  L-cysteine  oxidation  by  multi-vanadium  substituted 

The electrochemistry of the three Dawson-type POMs considered in this work was described 

previously [16]. For all these compounds, it was checked that the vanadium sites are the only  

active centers for the catalysis of L-cysteine oxidation. As a consequence, interest is focused 

only on these substituents. It is worth reminding briefly the main behaviours of these POMs. 

The redox processes of their V-centers were observed  in a potential domain well positive of 

those of the Mo- and W-centers [16]. P2V3W15 and P2V2W16 are stable between pH 0 and 8; 

the presence of the Mo atom narrows somewhat this domain for P2MoV2W15 which is stable 

from pH 0 to pH 7. Whatever the pH in these stability domains, separate redox processes were 

observed for V-centers. Their oxidising power, as judged from their formal potentials, is far 

lower for the trivanadic species compared to those of the divanadic POMs, which have close 

formal potentials. For example, at pH 7, these formal potentials are 122 mV, 298 mV and 309 

mV vs SCE respectively for P2V3W15, P2V2W16 and P2MoV2W15.  

For clarity in the forthcoming descriptions, Figure 1A shows the cyclic voltammogram (CV) 

associated with the V-centers of P2V2W16: it is constituted by a  first one-electron reversible 

wave followed by a composite wave, largely irreversible chemically. Prior to electrocatalysis 

experiments,  the  POMs  are  in  their  reduced  state  as  explained  in  the  Experimental  Section. 

Upon  addition  of  L-cysteine  in  the  medium,  a  current  increase  is  observed  readily  at  the 

oxidation  potential  of  the  first  V-wave.  The  high  efficiency  of  the  electrocatalysis  is  worth 

noting.  In  the  potential  domain  where  this  catalysis  is  observed,  the  direct  oxidation  of  L-

cysteine on the glassy carbon electrode surface is negligible [1,20]. The catalytic activity was 

observed to increase with pH; even so, it remains significant at pH 5 as appears from Figure 2. 

At this pH where the optimum catalytic activity is not obtained, the Figure indicates that the 

current  increases  at  the  potential  of  the  first  V-wave  even  for  small  values  of  the  excess 

parameter γ (γ = C°L-cysteine / C°  POM). Also, it must be pointed out that the electrocatalysis is 

observed in the same potential domain as in the pH 7 medium, because the characteristics of 

the first V-redox couple does no longer vary with pH for pH values > 4 [16]. 

In the following, the catalytic efficiencies of the other POMs will be compared with that of 

P2V2W16 in the pH 7 buffer, a medium useful for the study of biological systems. 

Figure 3A shows the catalytic activities, for the oxidation of L-cysteine, to be comparable for 

the  two  divanadic  species,  P2V2W16  and  P2MoV2W15.  However,  due  to  its  higher  stability,  

 

 

 

5

P2V2W16 is a better candidate for long term applications in the pH 7 to 8 media suitable for 

biological  systems.  The  tri-V-substituted  POM,  P2V3W15  is  also  very  stable  in  these  media. 

However,  Figure  3B  shows  its  catalytic  activity  to  be  much  lower  than  that  of  P2V2W16. 

Indeed, this Figure does show that the presence of P2V3W15 makes the oxidation of L-cysteine 

to  occur  in  a  potential  domain  more  negative  than  in  its  absence.  Nonetheless,  the  CVs 

indicate  an  overall  electron  transfer  kinetics  during  the  catalysis  much  slower  than  in  the 

presence  of  P2V2W16.  Tentatively,  the  difference  in  formal  potentials  of  these  two  catalysts 

might explain this observation (122 mV and 298 mV for P2V3W15 and P2V2W16, respectively). 

3.2. Comparison, in the pH 7 medium, of the electrochemical and electrocatalytic 

properties  of  the  multi-vanadium-substituted  Dawson-type  POMs  and  the  sandwich-

Actually, the POM As2V3W18 must be formulated As2V2
sandwich-type  species  with  the  vanadium  atoms  in  two  different  oxidation  states  (VV  and 
VIV). To our knowledge, the electrochemistry of this POM was not described previously. For 

completeness of the description of its CV, it is pointed out that the reduction of the tungsten 

centers appear at – 1.130 V vs SCE, close to the supporting electrolyte discharge. However, as 

stated  in  the  preceding  section,  the  present  study  focuses  on  the  redox  behaviours  of  V-

centers,  which  constitute  the  active  element  for  the  oxidation  of  L-cysteine.  Figure  4A

notice,  the  redox  processes  of  the  V-centers    are  located  in  a  potential  domain  (roughly  - 

0.400 V to + 0.600 V) well positive of that of W-centers (- 0.800 V to – 1.130 V). In other 

words, the vanadium centers are much more easily reduced than the W-centers, in agreement 

with previous observations with mono- or multi-V-substituted POMs [16,21,22]. The CV of 
IVV  centers  in  Figure  4A  shows  a  reversible  reduction  wave  located  at  –  0.220  V  and  a 

V2

large current intensity composite and reversible oxidation wave , the main peak of which is 

located at + 0.296 V. These waves are attributed respectively to the one electron reduction of 
the VV center and to the two-electron oxidation of the two VIV centers. For clarity, it is worth 
emphasizing that the two VIV centers are associated with two, very closely spaced, chemically 

reversible waves, which can, however, be distinguished on scrutiny of Figure 4A. Controlled 

potential  coulometry  performed  at  +  0.400  V  confirms  that  two  electrons  per  molecule  are

actually consumed for the whole oxidation process. During this electrolysis, a colour change 
is also observed from the brown colour of VIV centers to the yellow colour of VV centers. In 
IVVW18  to  contain  2  VIV  centers  and  one  VV  center,  in 

short,  electrochemistry  shows  As2V2

agreement with titration, elemental analysis and magnetic measurements on this element. 

The  results  obtained  at  pH  7  indicate  that  the  characteristics  of  the  redox  processes  of 
IVVW18  are  very  different  from  those  of  the  three  Dawson-type  V-substituted  POMs 

As2V2

studied in the preceding section. The most important difference concerns the redox behaviour 
IVVW18. The two-electron composite wave that features this 
of the two VIV centers of As2V2

process shows that the two anticipated one-electron processes are very close from each other. 

It is worth noting that these waves remain practically merged whatever the potential scan rate 
in the range from 2 mV s-1 to 500 mV s-1. Indeed, a sharp contrast exists with the behaviours 
of the two VV centers of P2V2W16 or P2MoV2W15 [16]. It must be reminded that Figure 1A 

illustrates the example of P2V2W16 in  which  the two  one-electron steps  are characterised by 

two  waves  with  their  reduction  peaks  separated  by  0.596  V  and  the  reoxidation  peaks 

separated  by  0.250  V.  The  electron  transfer  in  the  second  redox  couple  of  P2MoV2W15  is 

faster  than  observed  for  the  corresponding  process  of  P2V2W16.  However,  the  two  redox 

couples  of  P2MoV2W15  remain  distinct,  and  the  corresponding  reduction  peaks  and 

reoxidation  peaks  are  separated  respectively  by  0.514  V  and  0.308  V.  In  contrast,  a  loose 
IVVW18:  in  both  POMs,  the  redox 

similarity  can  be  found  between  P2V3W15  and  As2V2

processes are featured by a first reversible wave, followed by a composite wave, the two steps 
IVVW18,  

of  which  are  practically  merged  [16].  However,  at  variance  with  the  case  of  As2V2

very  slow  electron  transfer  kinetics  are  associated  with  this  second  wave  in  the  case  of 

P2V3W15.  Finally,  the  differences  observed  between  the  sandwich-type  POM  and  the  three 

Dawson  type  POMs  might,  likely,  be  explained  by  the  differences  between  their  overall 

acido-basic properties. 

 In  summary,  both  in  P2V3W15  and  As2V2

IVVW18,  two  of  their  V-centers  are  featured  by  a 

two-electron  composite  wave,  in  contrast  with  the  case  of  the  di-vanadium  substituted 

Dawson type POMs which show two very separated one-electron waves.  

 

3.2.2. Electrocatalysis  

Figure 4B indicates that the electrocatalytic oxidation of L-cysteine begins readily on the two-
IVVW18.  Here  again,  two 
closely  spaced  oxidation  waves  of  the  two  VIV  centers  of  As2V2

observations must be stressed: i) the two V-centers of interest are in the reduced state prior to 

the beginning of the electrocatalysis experiments; ii) the redox processes associated with the 

 

 

 

7

two  VIV  centers  are  chemically  reversAible,  at  least  in  the  timescale  of  slow  cyclic 

voltammetry. Qualitatively, the large current intensity of this catalytic wave and its chemical 

irreversibility indicate the efficiency of the reaction, as explained previously in the case of di-
IVVW18, the catalysis occurs 

vanadium substituted Dawson-type POMs. However, with As2V2

with  a  substantial  potential  gain  which  amounts  to  0.120  V  and  0.150  V  compared 

respectively  to  the  cases  of  P2V2W16  or  P2MoV2W15.  It  must  be  kept  in  mind  that,  with 

Dawson-type POMs, the peak of the catalytic process is located also close to their respective 

first  one-electron  waves,  active  for  the  electrocatalytic  oxidation  of  L-cysteine.  However, 

these waves are located at more positive potentials than the composite two-electron wave of 

As2V2

IVVW18 which triggers the same catalytic process. 

Finally, among the POMs studied in this work, As2V2

IVVW18 seems to be the best candidate, 

besides P2V2W16, for the catalytic oxidation of L-cysteine. Furthermore, no deactivation of the 

electrode is observed during several potential cycles, a behaviour worth of notice. In addition, 

an interval of the excess parameter γ = 1 to at least γ = 20 was tested and the catalytic current 

was found to vary linearly in this domain. At present, several hour stability has been observed 

for the reduced POM in the presence of cystein or cystine by UV-visible spectroscopy. The 

study of the long-term stability of the electrocatalytic system after thousands cycles is beyond 

the scope of this paper. 

It was found interesting to compare the activity of As2V2

IVVW18 with that of H4PVW17 which 

has  the  less  positive  formal  potential  among  the  mono-vanadium-substituted  Dawson-type 

POMs. For this purpose, double potential step chronocoulometry [19] was used to determine 

the second order rate constant of the reaction with the sandwich-type complex as performed  

previously with the mono-substituted complex [20]. The presence of an excess γ = 10 of L-

from 0 V to + 0.5 V and back to 0 V for As2V2

cysteine was used to establish pseudo first order conditions. The potential step programs were 
IVVW18 and from- 0.2 V to + 0.5 V and back to 
IVVW18  is  roughly  five  times  more 
–  0.2  V  for  H4PVW17.  The  results  indicate  that  As2V2
efficient than H4PVW17, as judged from the rate constants k = 5025 M-1 s-1 and 1000 M-1 s-1 

for the two complexes respectively. The increased number of vanadium atoms appears to be 

beneficial  to  the  electrocatalytic  process.  The  relatively  high  rate  constants  indicate 

substantial improvement of the kinetics of L-cysteine oxidation on the glassy carbon electrode 

surface.  This  feature  must  be  constrasted  with  the  known  slowness  and  sluggishness  of  the 

oxidation of thiols at solid electrodes, including glassy carbon, on which the reaction requires 

at least 1.0 V to be effective [1,7].  

 

8

 All  the  results  together  suggest  that  the  structure  of  the  POM  intervenes  as  an  important 

parameter  :  as  a  matter  of  fact,  P2V3W15  is  the  weaker  electrocatalyst  among  all  the  POMs 
IVVW18. 

studied in this work, even though it contains the same number of V-atoms as As2V2

Accumulation of vanadium atoms in the POM framework is beneficial as was also observed 

previously for several sandwich-type POMs in the electrocatalytic reduction of the NOx [23-

27] or that of O2 [28-30]. In addition, the present work highlights the important influence of 

the POM structure in the electrocatalytic oxidation of L-cysteine. Finally, the two trivanadic 

POMs show an overall two-electron redox process for two of their V-centers; however, these 

waves,  in  the  case  of  P2V3W15,  are  located  in  a  too  negative  potential  domain  (between  – 

0.050 V and – 0.660 V) for an efficient electrocatalytic oxidation of L-cysteine.   

Conclusion and future work 

The remarkable outcome of this work is that the potential for the oxidation of L-cysteine in 

the presence of the selected POMs has been substantially driven in the negative direction 

compared to the case of glassy carbon alone, a feature that stresses the importance of the 

electrocatalysis. The stability of the systems must also be pointed out. 

Comparison  of  the  electrochemistry  of  several  V-containing  POMs  and  study  of  their  

electrocatalytic properties toward the oxidation of L-cysteine highlight behaviours that might 

be ultimately traced to their respective structures. The sandwich-type complex shows promise 

among these complexes.  Owing to the overall bielectronic process associated with two of its 
IVVW18  is  probably  a  good  candidate  for  numerous  electrocatalytic 

vanadium  centers,  As2V2

processes  that  need  two  electrons  to  proceed.  Furthermore,  its  stability  and  the  absence  of 

inhibition  phenomena  during  potential  cycling  experiments  entitle  us  to  envision  it  for  the 

fabrication of chemically modified electrodes for analytical purposes. Work is progress in this 

direction. 

The  important  decrease  of  the  overpotential  for  cysteine  oxidation  raises  the  question  of 

applicability  of  the  systems  in  complex  biological  media,  where  other  analytes  might 
IVVW18  and  glutathione show promise for an 

interfere. Preliminary experiments with As2V2

important selectivity in favour of cysteine. Work in progress will also examine other relevant 

biological species.

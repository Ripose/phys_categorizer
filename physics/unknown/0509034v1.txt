1  Introduction 

In  this  article  an  analytical  solution  of  equations  of  motion  of  a  rigid  disk  of  finite 

thickness rolling on its edge on a perfectly rough horizontal plane under the action of 

gravity is given. The solution is given in terms of Gauss hypergeometrical functions. 

Key words: Dynamics, Rolling disk, Analytical solution 

 

 

This  paper  is  devoted  to  an  integration  of  the  equations  of  motion  of  a  rigid  disk  of 

finite thickness rolling on its edge on a perfectly rough horizontal plane under the action 

of gravity. Historically, the problem was one of the challenges of 19 century dynamics. 

From  the  historical  notes  of  Routh  ([9]),  O'Reilly  ([8])  and  Borisov  et  al  ([3]),  the 

solution of the problem for an infinitely thin disk in the terms of Gauss hypergeometric 

functions  was  in  1900  provided  by  P.Appel  and  D.Korteweg  and  before  them 

independently, in 1897, by S.A.Chaplygin. Their solution can be found, for example, in 

textbooks  (see  [1],[7],[11]).  A  little  later,  in  1903,  E.Gallop  noted  that  the  solution  of 

the problem of a rolling disk leads to Legendere's equation. His solution can be found in 

Routh’s  book  ([9]).    Recently,  the  analytical  solution  in  terms  of  Legendre  functions 

was used by O'Reilly ([8]) for the study of bifurcations and stability of steady motion of 

an infinitely thin disk. A similar study was performed by Kuleshev ([5],[6]) but he used 

solutions in terms of  Gauss hypergeometric functions. These functions were also used

by  Borisov  at  all  ([3])  for  construction  of  the  bifurcation  diagrams  and  qualitative 

analysis of the point of contact of a disk on a plane. 

From the review of literature it is clear that the motion of an infinitely thin disk is well 

studied, but this is not the case for disk of finite thickness. As was noted by Routh ([9]), 

the equation of motion for that case can be derived from the general equation of motion 

of the body of revolution by putting the radius of curvature at zero. This was done by 

Webster  ([11]),  but  he  then  treated  only  the  special  case  of  an  infinitely  thin  disk.  It 

seems that only the recent paper of Kessler and O'Reilly ([4]), devoted to the settling of 

a science toy called Euler's disk, discusses a disk of finite thickness. In this paper the 

authors  derived  the  equation  of  motion  for  the  case  of  sliding  and  that  of  rolling  and 

rolling with slip and then performed a numerical simulation of the so-called stick-slip 

movement of the disk.  

The purpose of this paper is to provide an analytical solution of the equation of motion 

of the problem which as it seems has not yet been given. The next section reviews the 

basic equations, the following gives the solution of the equations and the last provides 

an example of the application of the derived solution through the calculation of phase 

diagrams and normal reaction force. 

 

2 Equations 

Consider a rigid homogeneous disk moving on a perfectly rough horizontal plane in the 

homogeneous  gravity  field  with  acceleration  g.  The  disk  radius  is  a,  height 

2h

  and 

mass m.  In what follows, the dimensionless form of the equations will be used. They 

are obtained if units of mass, length and time are m, a, and 

a g .  

Following  Kessler  and  O'Reilly  ([2],[4]),  the  position  of  the  disk  is  defined  by  the 

Cartesian coordinates of its centre of mass and the Euler angles  (

,ψ θ ϕ  where ψ is 

,

)

the precession angle, 

θ

(
∈ −

2,
π π

2,

)  is the inclination angle--i.e., the angle between 

the  disk  axis  and  the  plane  and  vertical--and  ϕ  is  the  rotation  angle.  Note  that  the

The  connection  between  constants 

,A B+

+   and 

,A B−

− depends  on  the  condition  of 

imposing on 

2ω  and it’s derivative 

0θ= .  

3 Solution at 

0θ=  

 

Physically,  when  passing

0θ= ,  the  disk  impacts  the  plane  on  a  line  on  the  disk 

bounding  surface.  However  if  one  assumes  that  the  bounding  surface  is  slightly 

concave, then at 

0θ=  the disk contacts the plane on two points on each edge of each 

side.  Thus  at  impact  the  disk  loses  contact  at  one  edge  and  gains  it  on  the  other. 

Omitting the details it can easily be shown from the general equation of motion of the 

disk ([2]) that in this case the components of angular velocities after the impact are

where  +    and

  superscripts  denote  values  after  and  before  impact  and 

ε  is  the 

restitution coefficient. Using (26) it follows from (3) that the energy lost at the impact is

It is clear from (27) that when passing 

0θ=  there is always energy loss even in the case 

of  elastic  impact;  i.e.,  when 

1ε=   providing 

0h >

  and

0ω− ≠ .  In  the  case  of  an 

3

infinitely  thin  disk  when 

0h =

  it  follows  from  (26)  that  the  component  of  angular 

velocities pass continuously through 

0θ=  and also, from (27), that there is no loss of 

energy; i.e.,

Once the analytical solution is known it can be used for various purposes; for example, 

for studies of steady motion and bifurcations. In this paper, however, it will be used to 

illustrate the calculation of the phase diagram and calculation of the normal force which

For the purpose of numerical calculation the functions (24) and their derivatives were 

tabulated  for  various  values  of  h  and  θ  by  using  the  Maple  program.  The  tabulated 

values  were  then  used  in  a  special  written  Fortran  program  was  used  for  various 

calculations.  Here  it  is  worthwhile  to  note  that  there  is  practically  no  program  in  the 

public  domain  for  an  evaluation  of  Gauss  hypergeometric  functions  with  complex 

parameters  and  argument.  (In  fact,  the  author  found  just  two;  one  of  which  provided 

incorrect results, while the other was extremely slow).   

Figures 1 and 2 show the phase portraits of (3) and contour graph of normal force given 

by (28) for the two case of

h =

0.17

. For both cases the integration constants  A and B 

were calculated from the condition of steady motion with 

θ =
0

arctan h

 and giving spin 

angular velocity, which is defined as 

dtψΩ ≡
d

 ([2]).  

In the case 

Ω =
0

 shown in Figure 1 the calculated values of the integration constant 

are

 (approximately). For 

0θ<  the constants 

are,  from  (26), 

A− = −

0.166

  and 

B− = −

0.134

.  It  is  seen  from  Figure  1  (left)  that  on 

each side of the 

0θ=  line there are one stable and one unstable state. When passing the 

line 

0θ=  energy drops (cf. (27)) and the resulting bouncing settles the disk at the stable 

position 

0θ= . The contour plot of normal force shows that the whole theory is valid

only for 

1ω < , approximately, since for larger values of 

1

1ω  the normal force becomes 

negative.

Ω =

 shown in Figure 2 the calculated values of the integration constant 

are

  and

  and,  from  (26),

  and

(approximately). Unlike the previous case as it is seen from Figure 2 (left) there is no 

stable position on the negative side of 

0θ=  and only one stable position on the positive 

side.  In  each  passing  of  the  line 

0θ=   the  energy  drops  (cf.  (27))  and  the  resulting 

bouncing  settles  the  disk  in  the  orbit  just  touching 

0θ +=

  around  the  stable  position. 

Again the contour plot of normal force [Figure 2 (right)] shows that the whole theory is 

valid  only  for 

1ω < ,  approximately,  since  for  larger  values  of 

1

1ω   the  normal  force 

becomes negative.

Conclusions 

 
An analytical solution of equations of motion of a rigid disk of finite thickness rolling 

on its edge on a perfectly rough horizontal plane under the action of gravity is given in 

terms  of  Gauss  hypergeometrical  functions.  Unlike  with  an  infinitely  thin  disk,  the 

solution has its jump at point 

0θ=  due to the impact of disk with the plane. Examples 

worked  out  show  that  the  solution  correctly  predicts  the  vertical  stable  equilibrium 

position for a slowly rotated disk. It also shows that the normal force can become zero 

for 

1ω > , approximately, so the disk could lose contact with surface. This is, however, 

1

not the case for larger inclination angles where normal contact force grows rapidly.

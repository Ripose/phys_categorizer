          tric induction. Some contradictions found in fundamental studies on classical electrodynamics   
          have been explained. The notion “magnetoelectric induction” has been introduced, which per- 
          mits symmetrical writing of the induction laws. It is shown that the results of the special the-     
          ory of relativity can be obtained from these laws through the Galilean transformations. The  
          permittivity and permeability of  materials media are shown to be independent of frequency.  
         The notions “magnetoelectrokinetic and electromagnetopotential waves” and “kinetic capac-  
          ity” have been introduced. It is shown that along with the longitudinal Langmuir resonance,  
          the transverse resonance is possible in nonmagnetized plasma, and both the resonances are  
          degenerate. A new notion “scalar-vector  potential” is introduced, which permits solution of  
          all present-day problems of classical electrodynamics. The use of the scalar-vector potential  
          makes the magnetic field notion unnecessary. 
 
                                                               Introduction  
  
     Until now, some problems of classical electrodynamics involving the laws of electromagnetic  
induction have been interpreted in a dual or even contraversal way.  
    As an example, let us consider how the homopolar operation is explained in different works. In [1] 
this is done using the Faraday low specified for the  “discontinuous motion” case. In [2] the rule of 
flow is rejected and the operation of the homopolar generator is explained on the basis of the Lor-
entz force acting upon  charges. 
    The contradictory approaches are most evident in Feynman’s work [2] (see page 53): the rule of 
flow states that the contour e.m.f. is equal to the opposite-sign rate of change in the magnetic flux 
through the contour when the flux varies either with the changing field or due to the motion of the 
contour (or to both). Two options – “the contour moves” or “the field changes” are indistinguishable 
within the rule. Nevertheless, we use these two completely different laws to explain the rule for the 

two cases:   [

ther on: There is hardly another case in physics when a simple and accurate general law has to be 
interpreted in terms of two different phenomena. Normally, such beautiful generalization should be 
based on a unified fundamental principle. Such principle is absent in our case. The interpretation of 
the Faraday law in [2] is also commonly accepted: Faraday’s observation led to the discovery of a 
new law relating electric and magnetic fields: the electric field is generated in the region where the 
magnetic field varies with time. There is however an exception to this rule too, though the above 
studies do not mention it. However, as soon as the current through such a solenoid is changed, an 
electric field is excited externally. The exception seem to be too numerous. The situation really 
causes concern when such noted   physicists as Tamm and Feynman have no common approach to 
this seemingly simple question.  
    It is knowing [3] that classical electrodynamics fails to explain the phenomenon of phase aberra-
tion. As applied to propagation of light, the phenomenon can be explained only in terms of the spe-
cial theory of relativity (STR).   However, the Maxwell equations are invariant with respect to the 
covariant STR transformations, and there is therefore every reason to hope that they can furnish the 
required explanation of the phenomenon. 
    It is well known that electric and magnetic inductivities of material media can depend on fre-
quency, i.e. they can exhibit dispersion. But even Maxwell himself, who was the author of the basic 
equations of electrodynamics,  believed that  e  and  m
 were frequency-independent fundamental con-
stants. 
    How the idea of  e  and  m -dispersion appeared and evolved is illustrated vividly in the monograph 
of well-known specialists in physics of plasma [4]: while working at the equations of electrodynamics 
of material, media, G. Maxwell looked upon electric and magnetic inductivities as constants (that is 
why this approach was so lasting). Much later, at the beginning of the XX century, G. Heavisidr and 
R.Wull put forward their explanation for phenomena of optical dispersion (in particular rainbow) in 
which electric and magnetic inductivities came as functions of frequency. Quite recently, in the mid-
50ies of the last century, physicists arrived at the conclusion that these parameters were dependent 
not only on the frequency but on the wave vector as well. That was a revolutionary breakaway from 
the current concepts. The importance of the problem is clearly illustrated by what happened at a 
seminar held by L. D. Landau in 1954, where he interrupted A. L. Akhiezer reporting on the subject: 
“Nonsense, the refractive index cannot be a function of the refractive index”. Note, this was said by 
L. D. Landau, an outstanding physicist of our time.  
    What is the actual situation? Running ahead, I can admit that Maxwell was  right: both e  and m
 are 
frequency – independent constants characterizing one or another material medium. Since dispersion 
of electric and magnetic inductivities of material media is one of the basic problems of the present – 
day physics and electrodynamics, the system of views on these questions has to be radically altered 
again (for the second time!). 
    In this context the challenge of this study was to provide a comprehensive answer to the above 
questions and thus to arrive at a unified and unambiguous standpoint. This will certainly require a 
revision of the relevant interpretations in many fundamental works. 

 
1. Equations of electromagnetic induction  
in moving coordinates 
 
    The Maxwell equations do not permit us to write down the fields in moving coordinates proceed-
ing from the known fields measured in the stationary coordinates. Generally, this can be done 
through the Lorentz transformations but they so not follow from classical electrodynamics. In a ho-
mopolar generator, the electric fields are measured in the stationary coordinates but they are actually 
excited in the elements which move relative to the stationary coordinate system. Therefore, the prin-

ciple of the homopolar generator operation can be described correctly only in the framework of the 
special theory of relativity (STR). This brings up the question: Can classical electrodynamics furnish 
correct results for the fields in a moving coordinate system, or at least offer an acceptable approxi-
mation? If so, what form will the equations of electromagnetic induction have? 
    The Lorentz force is

It bears the name of Lorentz it follows from his transformations which permit writing the fields in the 
moving coordinates if the fields in the stationary coordinates are known. Henceforward, the fields 
and forces generated in a moving coordinate system will be indicated with primed symbols.  
    The clues of how to write the fields in moving coordinates if they are known in the stationary sys-
tem are available even in the Faraday law. Let us specify the form of the Faraday law:

The specified law, or, more precisely, its specified form, means that E
 should be primed if 
the contour integral is sought for in moving coordinates and unprimed for stationary coordinates. In 
the latter case the right-hand side of Eq. (1.2) should contain a partial derivative with respect to time 
which fact is generally not mentioned in literature. 
    The total derivative with respect to time in Eq. (1.2) implies that the final result for the contour 
e.m.f. is independent of the  variation mode of the flux. In other words, the flux can change either 
 or because the system, in which (cid:242)

which suggests that the motion in the magnetic field excites an additional electric field described  by 
the final term in Eq. (1.6). Note that Eq. (1.6) is obtained from the slightly specified Faraday law and 
not from the Lorentz transformations. 
    According to Eq. (1.6), a charge moving in the magnetic field is influenced by a force perpendicu-
lar to the direction of the motion. However, the physical nature of this force has never been consid-
ered. This brings confusion into the explanation of the homopolar generator operation and does not 
permit us to explain the electric fields outside an infinitely long solenoid on the basis of the Maxwell 
equations.

    As seen in Eq. (1.9), the field strength, and hence the force acting upon a charge consists of three 
components. 
    The first component describes the pure time variations of the magnetic vector potential. The sec-
ond term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9)  is evidently connected with the changes in the vector 
potential caused by the motion of a charge in the spatially varying field of this potential. The origin of 
the last term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9) is quite different. It is connected with the potential

forces because the potential energy of a charge moving in the potential field  BA

 is 

(

equal to 

(

)

. The magnitude

 describes the force just as the scalar potential 

gradient does. 
    Using Eq. (1.9), we can explain physically all the strength components of the electronic field ex-
cited in the moving and stationary cooperates. If our concern is with the electric fields outside a long 
solenoid, where the no magnetic field, the first term in the right-hand side of Eq. (1.9) come into 
play. In the case of a homopolar generator, the force acting upon a charge is determined by the last 
two terms in the right-hand side of Eq.(1.9), both of them contributing equally. 
    It is therefore incorrect to look upon the homopolar generator as the exception to the flow rule 
because, as we saw above, this rule allows for all the three components. Using the rotor in both sides 
of  Eq. (1.10) and taking into account  rot grad ”

 0, we obtain

 If motion is absent,  Eq. (1.11) turns into Maxwell equation (1.2). Equation (1.11) is certainly less 
informative than Eq.  (1.2):  because of  rot grad ”
 0, it does not include the forces defined in terms 

. It is therefore more reasonable to use Eq. (1.2) if we want to allow for all 

components of the electric fields acting upon a charge both in the stationary and in the moving coor-
dinates. 
    As a preliminary conclusion, we may state that the Faraday Law,   Eq. (1.2), when examined 
closely, explains clearly all features of the homopolar generator operation, and this operation princi-
ple is a consequence, rather than an exception, of the flow rule, Eq. (1.2). Feynman’s statement that

laws is contrary to fact. The Faraday law is just the sole unified fundamental principle which Feyn-
man declared to be missing. Let us clear up another Feynman’s interpretation. Faraday’s observation 
in fact led him to discovery of a new law relating electric and magnetic fields in the region where the 
magnetic field varies with time and thus generates the electric field. This correlation is essentially true 
but not complete. As shown above, the electric field can also be excited where there is no magnetic 
field, namely, outside an infinitely long solenoid. A more complete formulation follows from Eq. 

(1.9) and the relationship

    This suggests that a moving or stationary charge interacts with the field of the magnetic vector 
potential rather than with the magnetic field. The knowledge of this potential and its evolution can 
only permit us to calculate all the force components acting upon charges. The magnetic field is 
merely a spatial derivative of the vector field.  

As follows from the above consideration, it is more appropriate to write the Lotentz force in 

terms of the magnetic vector potential

which visualizes the complete structure of the force. 
    The Faraday law, Eq. (1.2) is referred to as the law of electromagnetic induction because it shows 
how varying magnetic fields can generate electric fields. However, classical electrodynamics contains 
no law of magnetoelectric induction showing how magnetic fields can be excited by varying electric 
fields. This aspect of classical electrodynamics evolved along a different pathway. First, the law

These equations present the law of magnetoelectric induction written in terms of the  
electric vector potential. 
    To illustrate the importance of the introduction of the electric vector potential, we come back to 
r
an infinitely long solenoid. The situation is much the same, and the only change is that the vectors B
r
are replaced with the vectors  D
. Such situation is quite realistic: it occurs when the space between 
the flat capacitor plates is filled with high electric inductivities. In  this case the displacement flux is 
almost entirely inside the dielectric. The attempt   to calculate the magnetic field outside the space 

 

) runs into the same problem that existed for the calculation 

r
 are mutually connected, i.e. the movement in the fields  H

occupied by the dielectric (where 
r
beyond the fields  E
 of an infinitely long solenoid. The introduction of the electric vector potential 
permits a correct solution of this problem. This however brings up the question of priority: what is 
primary and what is secondary? The electric vector potential is no doubt primary because electric 
vortex fields are excited only where the rotor of such potential is non-zero. 
r
    As follows from Eqs. (1.20), if the reference systems move relative to each  other, the fields  E
r
and  H
versa. But new consequences appear, which were not considered in classical electrodynamics. For 
r
illustration, let us analyze two parallel conducting plates with the electric field  E
 in between. In this 
case the surface charge  rS per unit area of each plate is  eЕ. If the other reference system is made to 
move parallel to the plates in the field  Е at the velocity  DV, this motion will generate an additional 
field DН =  DVeЕ. If a third reference system starts to move at the velocity  DV, within the above 
moving system, this motion in the field  DН will generate DЕ = meDV2Е, which is another contribu-
tion to the field Е. The field  E ¢  thus becomes stronger in the moving system than it is in the station-
ary one. It is reasonable to suppose that the surface charge at the plates of the initial system has in-

y-axis. It is in the  xy-plane and 
tilted about the  y-axis at an angle determined by Eqs. (1.27). The ratio between the absolute values 
of the vectors Е and Н is the same in both the systems. This is just what is known as phase aberration 
in classical electrodynamics.

  2. Is there any dispersion of electric and magnetic inductivities    in    
                                            material   media? 
 
    It is noted in the introduction that dispersion of electric and magnetic inductivities of   material 
media is a commonly accepted idea. The idea is however not correct. 
    To explain this statement and to gain a better understanding of the physical essence of the prob-
lem, we start with a simple example showing how electric lumped-parameter circuits can be de-
scribed. As we can see below, this example is directly concerned with the problem of our interest and 
will give us a better insight into the physical picture of  the electrodynamic processes in material me-
dia. 
    In a parallel resonance circuit including a capacitor С and an inductance coil L, the applied voltage 
U and the total current IS  through the circuit are related as

consider the physical meaning jog the magnitudes e(w) and m(w) for material media. 
 

2.1 Plasma media 
 
    A superconductor is a perfect plasma medium in which charge carriers (electrons) can move with-
out friction. In this case the equation of motion is 

r
where m and  e are the electron mass and charge, respectively;  E
the velocity. Taking into account the current density 

we can obtain from Eq. (2.18)  

 In Eqs. (2.19) and (2.20) n is the specific charge density. Introducing the notion

 Here Lk is the kinetic inductivity of the medium. Its existence is based on the fact that a charge car-
rier has a mass and hence it possesses inertia properties.

nance can be transverse with respect to the direction of electromagnetic waves. 
    It is known that the Langmuir resonance is longitudinal. No other resonances have ever been 
detected in nonmagnetized plasma. Nevertheless, transverse resonance is also possible in such 
plasma, and its frequency coincides with that of the Langmuir resonance. To understand the origin of 
the transverse resonance, let us consider a long line consisting of two perfectly conducting planes

To make the results obtained more illustrative, henceforward, the method of equivalent circuits will 
be used along with mathematical description. It is seen that CЕS and LHS increase with growing z. The

    If plasma in which charge carriers can move free of friction is placed within the open line and then 
the current   I, is passed through it, the charge carriers moving at a certain velocity start storing ki-

 Earlier, we introduced this magnitude by another way (see Eq. (2.21)).Eq. (2.55) corresponds to 
case of uniformly distributed d.c. current. 
    As we can see from Eq. (2.54),  LHS , unlike CЕS and  LkS , decreases when  z grows. This is clear 
physically because the number of parallel-connected inductive elements increases with growing 
z.  
The equivalent circuit of the line with nondissipative plasma is shown in Fig. 2.2 б. The line itself is

This brings us to a very interesting result: the resonance frequency of the macroscopic resonator is 
independent of its size. It may seem that we are dealing here with the Langmuir resonance because 
the obtained frequency corresponds exactly to that of the   Langmuir resonance. We however know 
that the Langmuir resonance characterizes longitudinal waves. The wave propagating in the phase 

velocity in the  z-direction is equal to infinity and the wave vector is 
, which corresponds to 
the solution of Eqs. (2.24) for a line of pre-assigned configuration (Fig. 2.1). Eqs. (2.25) give a well-
known result. The wave number is

    For the plasma under consideration, the phase velocity of the electromagnetic wave is equal to 
infinity. Hence, the distribution of the fields and currents over the line is uniform at each instant of 
time and independent of the z-coordinate. This implies that, on the one hand, the inductance  LHS has 
no effect on the electrodynamic processes in the line and, on the other hand, any two planes can be 
used instead of conducting planes to confine plasma above and below.  
Q-
    Eqs. (2.58) , (2.59) and (2.60) indicate that we have transverse resonance with an infinite 
factor. The fact of transverse resonance, i.e. different from the Langmuir resonance, is most obvious 
when the Q-factor is not equal to infinity. Then  kz „
 0 and the transverse wave is propagating in the 
line along the direction perpendicular to the movement of charge carriers. True, we started our 
analysis with plasma confined within two planes of a long line, but we have thus found that the pres-
ence of such resonance is entirely independent of the line size, i.e. this resonance can exist in an infi-
nite medium. Moreover, in infinite plasma transverse resonance can coexist with the Langmuir reso-
nance characterizing longitudinal waves. Since the frequencies of these resonances coincide, both of 
them are degenerate. Earlier, the possibility of transverse resonance was not considered. To ap-
proach the problem more comprehensively, let us analyze the energy processes in loss-free plasma. 
    The characteristic resistance of plasma determining the relation between the transverse compo-
nents of electric and magnetic fields can be found from

 Thus, the energy accumulated in the magnetic field is 

 times lower than that in the electric 

field. This traditional electrodynamic analysis is however not complete because it disregards one 
more energy component – the kinetic energy of charge carriers. It turns out that in addition to the 
electric and magnetic waves carrying electric and magnetic energy, there is one more wave in plasma 
– the kinetic wave carrying the kinetic energy of charge carriers. The specific energy of this wave is

 Hence, to find the total specific energy accumulated in unit volume of plasma, it is not sufficient to 
allow only for the fields Е and Н. 
    At the point w = wr

                  W E = Wk  , 

i.e. there is no magnetic field in the plasma, and the plasma is a macroscopic electromechanical cavity 
resonator of frequency wr.. 
    At w >  wr the wave propagating in plasma carries three types of energy – magnetic, electric and 
kinetic. Such wave can therefore be-called magnetoelectrokinetic. The kinetic wave is a current-

density wave

we are interested in the fact of loss and do not care of its mechanism. Nevertheless, even though we 
do not try to analyze the physical mechanism of loss, we should be able at least to measure sр.ef. 
    For this purpose, we choose a line segment of the length  z0 which is much shorter than the wave-
length in dissipative plasma. This segment is equivalent to a circuit with the following lumped pa-

2.2 Discussion of results. 
 
    We have found that  e  (w) is not dielectric inductivity permittivity. Instead, it includes two fre-
quency-independent parameters  e 0 and  Lk. What is the reason for the physical misunderstanding of 

the parameter  e (w)? This occurs first of all because for the case of plasma the  

r

- type

term is not explicitly present in the second Maxwell equation. 
    There is however another reason for this serious mistake in the present-day physics [7] as an ex-
ample. This study states that there is no difference between dielectrics and conductors at very high 
frequencies. On this basis the authors suggest the existence of a polarization vector in conducting 
media and this vector is introduced from the relation

r
where n is the charge carrier density,  mr
 is the current charge displacement. This approach is physi-
cally erroneous because only bound charges can polarize and form electric dipoles when the external 
field overcoming the attraction force of the bound charges accumulates extra electrostatic energy in 
the dipoles. In conductors the charges are not bound and their displacement would not produce any 
extra electrostatic energy. This is especially obvious if we employ the induction technique to induce 
current (i.e. to displace charges) in a ring conductor. In this case there is no restoring force to act 
upon the charges, hence, no electric polarization is possible. In   [7] the polarization vector found 
from Eq. (2.78) is introduced into the electric induction of conducting media

 The interpretation of  e(w) as frequency-dependent inductivity has been harmful for correct under-
standing of the real physical picture (especially in the educational processes). Besides, it has drawn 
away the researchers attention from some physical phenomena in plasma, which first of all include 
the transverse plasma resonance and three energy components of the magnetoelectrokinetic wave 
propagating in plasma. 
    Below, the practical aspects of the results obtained are analyzed, which promise new data and 
refinement of the current views.  
 

2.3 Practical aspects. 
 
    Plasma can be used first of all to construct a macroscopic single-frequency cavity for development 
of a new class of electrokinetic plasma lasers. Such cavity can also operate as a band-pass filter.  
At high enough 

pQ  the magnetic field energy near the transverse resonance is considerably lower 
than the kinetic energy of the current carriers and the electrostatic field energy. Besides, under cer-
tain conditions the phase velocity can much exceed the velocity of light. Therefore, if we want to 
excite the transverse plasma resonance, we can put

    Transverse plasma resonance offers another important application – it can be used to heat plasma. 
High-level electric fields and, hence, high change-carrier energies can be obtained in the plasma reso-
nator if its  Q-factor is high, which is achievable at low concentrations of plasma. Such cavity has the 
advantage that the charges attain the highest velocities far from cold planes. Using such charges for 
nuclear fusion, we can keep the process far from the cold elements of the resonator. 
 Such plasma resonator can be matched easily to the communication line. Indeed, the equiva-

 Such plasma resonators can be excited with d.c. current, as is the case with a monotron microwave 
oscillator [9]. It is known that a microwave diode (the plasma resonator in our case) with the transit 
angle of ~5/2p
 develops negative resistance and tends to self-excitation. The requirement of the tran-
sit angle equal to 5/2p

 correlates with the following d.c. voltage applied to the resonator:

    Applied fields cause polarization of bound charges in dielectrics. The polarization takes some en-
ergy from the field source, and the dielectric accumulates extra electrostatic energy. The extent of 
displacement of the polarized charges from the equilibrium is dependent on the electric field and the 
coefficient of elasticity  b

immediately that the vibrating charges of the dielectric have masses and thus possess inertia proper-

and the dielectric behaves just like plasma. This case has prompted the idea that at high frequencies 
there is no difference between dielectrics and plasma. The idea served as a basis for introducing the 
polarization vector in conductors [7]. The difference however exists and it is of fundamental impor-
tance. In dielectrics, because of inertia, the amplitude of charge vibrations is very small at high fre-
quencies and so is the polarization vector. The polarization vector is always zero in conductors.

and the permittivity of the dielectric is independent of frequency. It is 

 times higher than 

in vacuum. This result is quite clear. At w >> w0 the inertia properties areinactive and permittivity 
approaches its value in the static field. 
 
    The equivalent circuits corresponding to these two cases are shown in Figs. 2.3 а and b. It is seen 
that in the whole range of frequencies the equivalent circuit of the dielectric acts as a series oscilla-
tory circuit parallel-connected to the capacitor operating due to the electric inductivity  e0 of vacuum 
(see Fig. 2.3b). The resonance frequency of this series circuit is obviously obtainable from

    The resonance phenomena in plasma and dielectrics are characterized by repeated electrostatic-
kinetic and kinetic-electrostatic transformations of the charge motion energy during oscillations. This 
can be described as an electrokinetic process, and devices based on it (lasers, masers, filters, etc.) can 
be classified as electrokinetic units. However, another type of resonance is also possible, namely, 
magnetic resonance. Within the current concepts of frequency-dependent permeability, it is easy to 
show that such dependence is related to magnetic resonance. For example, let us consider ferromag-
netic resonance. A ferrite magnetized by applying a stationary field  Н0 parallel to the  z-axis will act 
as an anisotropic magnet in relation to the variable external field. The complex permeability of this 
medium has the form of a tensor [10]:

Conclusions 
 

    Thus, it has been found that along with the fundamental parameters e
electric and magnetic energy accumulated and transferred in the medium, there are two more basic 
material parameters Lk and  Ck. They characterize kinetic and potential energy that can be accumu-
lated and transferred in material media. Lk was sometimes used to describe certain physical phenom-
ena, for example, in superconductors [11],  Ck has never been known to exist. These four fundamen-
tal parameters e
0, Lk and Ck clarify the physical picture of the wave and resonance processes in 
material media in applied electromagnetic fields. Previously, only electromagnetic waves were 
thought to propagate and transfer energy in material media. It is clear now that the concept was not

complete. In fact, magnetoelectrokinetic, or electromagnetopotential waves travel in material media. 
The resonances in these media also have specific features. Unlike closed planes with electromagnetic 
resonance and energy exchange between electric and magnetic fields, material media have two types 
of resonance – electrokinetic and magnetopotential. Under the electrokinetic resonsnce the energy of 
the electric field changes to kinetic energy. In the case of magnetopotential resonance the potential 
energy accumulated during the precessional motion can escape outside at the precession frequency. 
    The notions of permittivity and permeability dispersion thus become physically groundless though

 are handy for a mathematical description of the processes in material media. We

 Eqs. (3.1), (3.2) and (3.3) apparently account for the change in the value of the moving charges. 
    Using these equations, it is possible to calculate the force of the conductor-current interactions 
and allow, through superposition, for the interaction forces of all moving and immobile charges in 
the conductors. We thus obtain all currently existing laws of electromagneticm.

    Both the approaches show that the interaction force of two conductors is the result of the interac-
tion of moving charges: some of them excite fields, the others interact with them. The immobile 
charges representing the lattice do not participate in the interaction in this scheme. But the forces of 
the magnetic interaction between the conductors act just on the lattice. Classical electrodynamics 
does mot explain how the moving charges experiencing this force can transfer it to the lattice. 
    The above models of iteration are in unsolvable conflict, and experts in classical electrodynamics 
prefer to pass it over in silence. The conflict is connected with estimation  of the interaction force of 
two parallel-moving charges. Within the above models such two charges should be attracted. Indeed, 
the induction В caused by the moving charge g1 at the distance r is 

 If another charge  g2 moves at the same velocity  V in the same direction at the distance  r from the 
first charge, the induction В at the location of g2 produces the force attracting g1 and g2.

An immovable observer would expect these charges to experience attraction along with the Coulomb 
repulsion. For an observer moving together with the charges there is only the Coulomb repulsion and 
no attraction. Neither classical electrodynamics not the special theory of relativity can solve the prob-
lem. Physically, the introduction of magnetic fields reflects certain experimental facts, but so far we 
can hardly understand where these fields come from. 
    In 1976 it was reported in a serious experimental study that a charge appeared on a short-circuited 
superconducting solenoid when the current in it was attenuating. The results of [13] suggest that the 
value of the charge is dependent on its velocity, which is first of all in contradiction with the charge 
conservation law. The author of this study has also investigated this problem [6, 12, 14]   (see be-
low). It is useful to analyze here the interaction of current-carrying systems in terms of Eqs. (3.1), 
(3.2) and (3.3) [12, 14].  
    We come back again to the interaction of two thin conductors with charges moving at the veloci-
ties V1 and V2 (Fig. 3.2).

It is seen that Eqs. (3.6), (3.9) and (3.13) coincide though they were obtained by different methods. 
    According to Feynman (see the introduction), the e.m.f. of the circuit can be interpreted using two 
absolutely different laws. The paradox has however been clarified. The force of the enteraction be-
tween the current-carrying systems can be obtained even by three absolutely different methods. But 
in the third method, the motion “magnetic field” is no longer necessary and the lattice can directly 
participate in the formation of the interaction forces. This was impossible with the previous two tech-
niques.

tor 

 Before  [13], there was no evidence for generation of electric fields by d.c. currents. 
    When Faraday and Maxwell formulated the basic laws of electrodynamics, it was impossible to 
confirm Eq. (3.17) experimentally because the current densities in ordinary conductors are too small 
to detect the effect. The assumption that the charge is independent of its velocity and the subsequent 
introduction of a magnetic field were merely voluntaristic acts.

    In superconductors the current densities permit us to find the correction for the charge 

experimentally. Initially, [13] was taken as evidence for the dependence of the value of the charge on 
its velocity. The author of this study has also investigated this problem [6, 12, 14], but, unlike [13], 
in his experiments current was introduced into a superconducting coil by an inductive non-contact 
method. Even in this case a charge appeared on the coil  [6, 12, 14]. The experimental objects were 
superconducting composite Nb – Ti wires coated with copper, and it is not cleat what mechanism is 
responsible for the charge on the coil. It may be brought by mechanical deformation which causes a 
displacement of the Fermi level in the copper. Experiments on non-coated superconducting wires 
may be more informative. Anyhow, the subject has not been exhausted and further experimental find-
ings are of paramount importance to fundamental physics. Using this model, we should remember 
that there is no reliable experimental data on static electric fields around the conductor. According to 
Eq. (3.16), such fields are excited because the value of the charge is dependent on its velocity. Is 
there any physical mechanism which could maintain the interacting current-carrying systems electri-
cally neutral within this model? Such mechanism  does exist. To explain it, let us consider the cur-
rent-carrying circuit in Fig. 3.3. This is a superconducting thin film whose thickness is smaller than 
the field penetration depth in the superconductor. The current is therefore distributed uniformly over 
the film thickness. Assume that the bridge connecting the wide parts of the film is much narrower 
than the rest of the current-carrying film. If persistent current is excited in such a circuit, the current

density and hence the current carrier velocity V1 in the bridge will much exceed the velocity V0  in the 
wide parts of the film. 
 

 

    

  

 
Fig.3.3.     Schematic view of a current-carrying circuit based on a superconducting  film. 
 
    Such situation is possible if the current carriers are accelerated in the part  d1 and slowed down in 
the part   d2. But acceleration and slowing-down of charges is possible only in electric fields. If V1 > 
V0, the potential difference between the parts  d1 and d2  which causes acceleration or slowing-down 
is determined as

  .                                            (3.18) 

 This potential difference can appear only due to the charge density gradient in the parts d1 and d2, 
i.e. the density of charge carriers decreases with acceleration and increases with slowing down. The 
relation n0 > n1 should be fulfilled, where n0 and n1   
are the current-carrier densities in the wide and narrow bridge parts of the film,  
respectively. It is clear that some energy is needed to accelerate charges which have masses. Let us 
find out where this energy comes from. 
    On acceleration the electrostatic energy available in the electrostatic field of the current carriers 
converts into kinetic energy. The difference in electrostatic energy between two identical volumes 
having different electron densities can be written as

    We see that the change in the current-carrier density is quite small, but this change is just respon-
sible for the existence of the longitudinal electric field accelerating or slowing down the charges in 
the parts  d1 and d2. Let us call such fields “configuration fields” as they are connected with a certain 
configuration of the conductor. These fields are available in normal conductors too, but they are 
much smaller than the fields related to the Ohmic resistance. 
    We can expect that a voltameter connected to the circuit, like is shown in Fig. 3.3, would be ca-
pable of registering the configuration potential difference in accordance with Eq. (3.18). If we used 
an ordinary liquid and a manometer instead of a voltameter, according to the Bernoulli equation, the 
manometer could  register the pressure difference. For lead films, the configuration potential differ-
ence is ~10 -7 В, though it is not observablt experimentally. We can explain this before hand. As the 
velocities of the current carriers increase and their densities decrease, the electric fields njrmal to 
their motion enhance. These two precesses counterbalance each other. As a result, the normal com-
ponent of the electric field has a zero balue in all parts of the film. In terms of the considered, this 
looks like

It is seen that two electron flows moving at the same velocity in the absence of a lattice experience 
only the Coulomb repulsion and no attraction included into the magnetic field concept. 
     Physically, in this model the force interaction of the current-carrying systems is not connected 
with any now field. The interaction is due to the enhancement of the electric fields normal to the di-
rection of the charge motion. 
    The phenomenological concept of the magnetic field of correct only when the charges of the cur-
rent carriers are compensated with the charges of the immobile lattice, the current carriers excite a 
magnetic field. The magnetic field concept is not correct for freely moving charges when there are no 
compensating charges of the lattice. In this case a moving charged particle or a flow of charged par-
ticles does not excite a magnetic field. Thus, the concept of the phenomenological magnetic field is 
true but for the above case. 
    It is easy to show that using the scalar-vector potential, we can obtain all the presently existing 
laws of magnetism. Besides, the approach proposed permits a solution of the problem of the interac-
tion between two parallel-moving charges which could not be solved in terms of the magnetic field 
concept.

                                     4. Problem of electromagnetic radiation 
 
    Whatever occurs in electrodynamic, it is connected with the interaction of moving and immobile 
charges. The introduction of the scalar-vector potential answers this question. The potential is based 
on the laws of electromagnetic and magnetoelectric induction. The Maxwell equations describing the 
wave processes in material media also follow from these laws. The Maxwell equations suggest that 
the velocity of field propagation is finite and equal to the velocity of light. 
    The problem of electromagnetic radiation can be solved of the elementary level using the scalar-
vector potential and the finiteness of propagation of electric processes. 
    For this purpose, the retarded scalar-vector potential

    It is surprising that Eq. (3.29) actually accounts for the whole of electrodynamics beause all cur-
rent electrodynamics problems can be solved using this equation. What is then a magnetic field? This 
is merely a convenient mathematical procedure which is not necessarily gives a correct result (e.g., in 
the case of parallel-moving charges). Now we can state that electrocurrent, rather than electromag-
netic, waves travel in space. Their electric field and displacement current vectors are in the same 
plane and displaced by p
    In terms of Eq. (3.29), electrodynamics and optics can be reconstructed completely to become 
simpler, more intelligible and obvious. 
The main ideas of this approach were described in the author’s publications [5], [6], [12], [14], [15]. 
However, the results reported have never been used, most likely because they remain unknown. The 
objective of this study is therefore to attract more attention to them.       
    Any theory is dead unless important practical results are obtained of its basis. The use of the pre-
viously unknown transverse plasma resonance is one of the most important practical results follow-

ABSTRACT: A computer-aided detection (CAD) system for the identification of pulmonary nodules in low-
dose multi-detector helical CT images with 1.25-mm slice thickness is being developed in the framework of 
the  INFN-supported  MAGIC-5  Italian  project.  The  basic  modules  of  our  lung-CAD  system,  a  dot- 
enhancement filter for nodule candidate selection and a voxel-based neural classifier for false-positive finding 
reduction,  are  described.  Preliminary  results  obtained  on  the  so-far  collected  database  of  lung  CT  scans  are 
discussed. 

1  INTRODUCTION  

Lung cancer is one of the most relevant public health 
problems.  Despite  significant  research  efforts  and 
advances  in  the  understanding  of  tumor  biology, 
there has been no reduction of the mortality over the 
last decades. Lung cancer most commonly manifests 
itself with the formation of non-calcified pulmonary 
nodules.  Helical  Computed  Tomography  (CT)  is 
recognized  as  the  best  imaging  modality  for  the 
detection  of  pulmonary  nodules  (Diederich  et  al. 
2001).  The  amount  of  data 
to  be 
interpreted  in  CT  examinations  can  be  very  large, 
especially  when  thin  collimation  settings  are  used, 
thus  generating  up  to  about  300  2-dimensional 
images per scan, corresponding to about 150 MB of 
data.

has  recently  started  (Italung-CT  trial).  In  this

(INFN  CSN-V)  project,  we  are  developing  a  CAD

2  THE CAD SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE 

 

Pulmonary  nodules  may  be  characterized  by  very 
low  CT  values  and/or  low  contrast,  they  may  have 
CT  values  similar  to  those  of  blood  vessels  and 
airway  walls  to  which  they  could  also  be  strongly 
connected.  Examples  of  lung  internal  nodules  are 
shown in Figure 1. 

In 

the 

lung  volume. 

An  important  and  difficult  task  in  the  automated 
nodule detection is the initial selection of the nodule 
candidates  within 
the 
identification  process,  lung  nodules  are  modeled  as 
spherical  objects  and  a  dot-enhancement  filter  is 
applied  to  the  3D  matrix  of  voxel  data.  The  filter 
attempts 
local  geometrical 
characteristics  of  each  voxel,  by  computing  the 
eigenvalues  of  the  Hessian  matrix  and  evaluating  a 
likelihood  function  that  was  specifically  built  to 
discriminate between the local morphology of linear, 
planar  and  spherical  objects,  the  latest  modeled  as 
having 3D Gaussian sections (Li et al. 2003; Delogu 
et al. 2005). A simple peak-detection algorithm (i.e. 

to  determine 

the 

a  local  maximum  detector)  is  then  applied  to  the 
filter output to detect the filtered-signal peaks. 

3  DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  

 

 

 

 
Figure  2.  Some  examples  of  false  positive  findings  generated 
by the dot-enhancement filter. 

 
Since most FP findings are provided by crossings 
between blood vessels (see Fig. 2), we attempted to 
reduce  the  amount  of  FP/scan  by  developing  a 
procedure  which  we  called  voxel-based  neural 
approach  (VBNA).  According  to  that  method,  each 
voxel  of  a  region  of  interest  (ROI)  is  characterized 
by  the  grey  level  intensity  values  of  its  neighbors 
(see  Fig.  3).  We  developed,  implemented  and 
compared  two  different  VBNA  procedures.  In  the 
first, 
the  voxels  in  a  3D 
neighborhood  of  each  voxel  of  a  ROI  are  rolled 
down  into  vectors  of  features  (147  features)  to  be 
analyzed  by  a  neural  classifier.  In  the  second 
procedure  (Gori,  I.  &  Mattiuzzi,  M.  2005),  6 
additional features constituted by the eigenvalues of 
the  gradient  and  the  Hessian  matrices  are  computed 
for  each  voxel  and  encoded  to  the  feature  vectors 
(153  features).  A  feed-forward  neural  network  is 
implemented at this stage to assign each voxel either 
to the nodule or normal tissue target class.  

the  CT  values  of 

A candidate nodule is then characterized as “CAD 
nodule”  if  the  number  of  pixels  within  its  ROI 
tagged  as  “nodule”  by  the  neural  classifier  is  above 
some  relative  threshold.  A  free  response  receiver 
operating  characteristic (FROC) curve for our CAD 
system  can  therefore  be  evaluated  at  different 
threshold levels.

The  CAD  system  was  developed  and  tested  on  a 
dataset  of  low-dose  (screening  setting:  140  kV, 
70÷80  mA)  CT  scans  with  reconstructed  slice 
thickness of 1.25 mm. The scans were collected and 
annotated  by  experienced 
the 
framework of the screening trial being conducted in 
Italy  (Italung-CT).  The  database  available  for  this 
study  consists  of  14  scans,  containing  24  internal 
nodules. Each scan is a sequence of about 300 slices

First  of  all,  the  lung  volume  is  segmented  out  of 
the  whole  3D  data  array  by  means  of  a  purposely 
built  segmentation  algorithm  that  identifies  the 
internal region of the lung (Antonelli et al. 2005).  

The  3D  dot-enhancement  filter  applied  to  the 
selected  lung  regions  shows  a  very  high  sensitivity. 
In particular, the lists generated by the peak-detector 
algorithm  for  all  CT  are  empirically  truncated  so  to 
include  all  annotated  nodules.  According  to  this 
procedure,  a  100%  sensitivity  to  internal  nodules  is 
obtained  at  a  maximum  (average)  number  of  54 
(52.3) FP/scan.  

With  respect  to  the  VBNA  procedure  for  FP 
reduction, the dataset was randomly partitioned into 
train  and  test  sets;  the  performances  of  the  trained 
neural networks were evaluated both on the test sets 
and on the whole dataset.  

trained  on 

In the first VBNA approach, 147 features, derived 
from  a  2D  region  of  7x7  voxels  for  3  consecutive 
slices  with  the  voxel  to  be  classified  in  the  center, 
constitute  each  vector  of  the  feature  dataset.  Two 
three-layer  feed-forward  neural  networks  with  147 
input,  were 
two  different  random 
partitions  of  the  dataset  into  train  and  test  sets.  The 
performances  achieved  in  each  trial  for  the  correct 
classification  of  individual  pixels  are  reported  in 
Table  1,  where  the  sensitivity  and  the  specificity 
values  obtained  on  the  test  sets,  on  the  whole 
datasets and the average values on the two trials are 
shown.

Also in case of the second VBNA approach, when 
6  additional  features  are  encoded  to  each  feature

If  the  sensitivity  value  is  decreased  to  87.5%  (21 
nodules detected out of 24), a rate of 0.9 FP/scan is 
obtained.  These  preliminary  results  are  promising, 
albeit a validation against an independent validation 
database is required.

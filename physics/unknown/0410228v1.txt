For production of low temperature plasmas with low collisionality, 2.45GHz microwave power 
up to 20kW is injected perpendicularly to the toroidal field at very low toroidal field Bt<0.1T. In 
the  case  Bt=0.0613T,  the  maximum  electron  density  reaches  three  times  of  the  O-mode  cutoff 
density and the measured power deposition is concentrated in the plasma core region beyond the 
Left-hand cutoff layer. It clearly suggests that this over-dense plasma is  produced and heated by 
electron Bernstein waves converted from the launched X-mode in the peripheral region with steep 
density gradient. 

 

 

 

1. Introduction 

   

A transport simulation based on “dimensional similarity” idea using a low temperature and 

density  helical  plasma  is  attempted,  where  principal dimensionless  plasma  parameters,  such as  the 

normalized  electron-ion  collision  frequency,  beta,  scale  length  of  temperature  and  of  density  and 

others  are  the  same,  except  the  normalized  Larmor  radius  is  different[1-4].  Here,  we  aim  at 

generating  this  low  temperature  and  density  plasma  at  very  low  toroidal  field  (Bt<0.1T)  with  2.45 

GHz  electron  cyclotron  wave  (ECW).  In  our  experiments,  the  plasma  has  relatively  low 

collisionality, and the normalized collision frequency already reaches the higher end of 1/ν regime. 

However, the value of beta has only about 1/5 compared with the value achieved in high magnetic 

field experiments.   

In  order  to  extend  these  dimensionless  parameters,  it  is  important  to  find  the  optimum 

condition so that incidence power should be efficiently absorbed to low temperature plasma. We pay 

attention to not only ECW but also Electronic Bernstein Wave (EBW)[4]. It is known that EBW can 

heat  over-dense  plasma  without  suffering  from  the  cutoff  density,  and  high  absorption  is  expected 

even in low temperature plasma. However, since EBW is electrostatic wave and cannot transmit in 

vacuum, the mode conversion scenario such as X-B or O-X-B is required[5-,7].    In this paper we 

present the experimental results on the production of over-dense plasma where the mode conversion 

into EBW is expected.

Plasma  production  and heating using 2.45GHz  microwaves up  to 20kW  is  carried  out at 

Bt<0.1T in the Compact Helical System (CHS)[8], which is a heliotron/torsatron (R=1.0m, a=0.2m). 
This plasma is produced with hydrogen gas in 7.0x10-5Torr. The launching methods of microwave 

are the following ways. One is the perpendicular injection of TE10-mode from the outboard side port 

in  the  horizontally  elongated  section,  of  which  mode  has  the  electric  field  perpendicular  to  the 

toroidal field, that is, this launching method expects the perpendicular injection of X-mode (Fig.1(a)). 

The other hand is the oblique injection of TE01-mode, of which mode has the electric field parallel to 

the toroidal field. This method is the oblique injection of O-mode. 

A  triple-Langmuir  probe  is  employed  to  simultaneously  measure  electron  density  (ne), 

electron temperature (Te) and space potential. This probe is installed on CHS as shown in Fig.1(b). 

The  central  line  averaged  electron  density  (ne

2mm)  is  measured  by  2mm  microwave  interferometer.       

The  local  electron  density  measured  by  the  probe  is  calibrated  by  ne

2mm.  In  addition,  Hα emission 

and total radiation power loss are monitored by a visible spectrometer and a bolometer, respectively. 

3. Experimental Results 

 

 

 

3.1 Plasma production and heating by perpendicular injection of X-mode 

First,  the  results  of  perpendicular  injection  of  X-mode  are  following.  Although  the 

polarization of wave is rather difficult due to strongly twisted magnetic field line in a helical plasma, 

we  tried  to  change  the  polarization  of  launching  waves  through  the  change  of  TE10  or  TE01  mode 

with or without a twisted waveguide. However, no obvious differences in plasma heating have been 

observed. Presumably, the polarization of launching waves is opaque because the wavelength of the 

wave  in  the  vacuum  is  fairly  large  to  be  about  half  of  the  plasma  minor  radius.  In  the  present 

condition, mixture of O-mode and X-mode will be injected. 

The  contour  plots  of  the  magnetic  field  strength  in  the  horizontally-elongated  section  in 

which an injection port is attached are shown in Fig.2 for two different field strength of Bt=0.0788T 

or Bt=0.0613T at the magnetic axis position of the vacuum field R=Rax, where Rax=97.4cm. As seen 

from these figures, in the case of Bt=0.0788T, the fundamental electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) 

layer  is  placed  near  the  plasma  center.  In  the  case  of  Bt=0.0613T,  the  fundamental  ECR  layer  is 

outside the last closed flux surface (LCFS). The second harmonic cyclotron layer resides in the outer 

plasma  region  for  both  cases.  Therefore,  the  absorption  by  the  fundamental  ECR  would  not  be 

expected in the case of Bt=0.0613T where waves are injected perpendicularly to the magnetic field 

line. It should be noted that the second harmonic cyclotron damping in the peripheral plasma region 

might be possible in the latter case. The results in both cases are described in this section.   

A  typical  time  evolution  of  the  microwaves-produced  plasma  at  Bt=0.0788T  is  shown  in 

12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, Nice, 2004 

Figs.3(a). The line averaged electron density ne

2mm exceeds the O-cutoff density (nc,o=7.4x1016m-3) 

for a short time interval from 50ms to 80ms. As shown in Fig.3(a), injected microwave power (Pin) is 

stepped  down  at  t=150ms.  The  radial  profiles  of  Te  and  ne  at  150ms  are  shown  in  Fig.3(b).  The 

absorption power density (Pabs) is derived using the following equation

across the power step at t=to. As seen from the profile of Pabs in Fig.3(b), most of microwave power 

is deposited in the higher density region inside the Right hand cutoff (R-cutoff) layer, but nearby the 

fundamental ECR layer. Moreover, ne at t~150ms is blow the cutoff density in a whole plasma region.   

Here,  we  try  to  check  the  possibility  of  EBW  heating  converted  through  X-B  conversion  process.

,where κ=ωe/Ωe[9].  Here, ωe, Ωe,  Ln,  and  LB  are  the  electron  plasma  frequency,  electron  cyclotron 

frequency, the scale length of density gradient, and the scale length of magnetic field at UHR layer, 

respectively. The parameter η stands for the optical thickness of the evanescent region. If η is less 

than unity, X-mode can penetrate into the evanescent region. In this case, the values of η and Cmax 

are  respectively  about  1.1  and  0.1,  so  that  the  possibility  of  X-B  conversion  should  be  very  low. 

Since  ne  is  lower  than  nc,o, it  is  concluded  that  the  absorption  is  realized  by  the  fundamental ECR 

damping of a portion of O-mode component rather than EBW. Total deposited power evaluated from 

Fig.3(b) is about 0.12kW across the power step-down (∆Pin~5kW), and corresponds to be very low 

absorption rate (~ 2.5% ) of the injected power. 

   

Next,  we  investigated  the  plasma  heating  in  the  latter  case  of  Bt=0.0613T.  In  the  shot 
2mm is more than twice nc,o throughout the discharge. The injection power Pin is 
stepped down at t=185ms. The radial profiles of Te and ne at 185ms are shown in Fig.4(b). As seen 

shown in Fig.4(a), ne

from Fig.4(b), ne exceeds nc,o over the almost whole plasma region ( ρ≤0.9). The microwave power 

is absorbed clearly inside the R-cutoff layer and the upper hybrid resonance (UHR) layer placed at 

the edge region of ρ~0.9. This suggests that fast X-mode - slow X-mode - EBW conversion takes 

place in the edge region[10]. In this process, fast X-mode will tunnel through the evanescent region 

between  the  R-cutoff  layer  and  the  UHR  layer,  and  then  be  converted  into  slow  X-mode  at  UHR 

layer. Moreover, the slow X-mode will be reflected almost perfectly at the left hand cutoff (L-cutoff) 

layer and finally converted into EBW at UHR layer. In this experiment, the values of η and Cmax are 

12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, Nice, 2004 

respectively about 0.8 and 0.3, so that the mode conversion should be possible. The total deposited 

power  is  about  0.5kW  across  the  power  step-down  (∆Pin~5kW),  and  corresponds  to  about  10% 

absorption for injected power. This low absorption rate may be due to wave power loss to the outside 

of plasma through multiple reflection caused by poor wave directivity and low one-path absorption 

rate. The other is that the scale length of electron density profile is not sufficiently small in the edge, 

compared with the wavelength. Moreover, large density fluctuations near the edge might degrade the 

purity of wave polarization and the conversion rate to EBW. 

 

 

 

3.2 Perpendicular injection to target over-dense plasma 

In order to clarify and increase the mode conversion rate to EBW, we tried to superimpose 

the perpendicular injection of microwave power as X-mode in the course of a discharge produced by 

obliquely  injected  high  power  microwaves  of  15kW.  The  target  plasma  for  the  additional 

perpendicular  injection  has  already  reached  high  density  having  a  steep  density  gradient  near  the 
2mm and the electron kinetic energy (E) are compared for 

edge. In Fig.5(a), the time evolutions of ne

both cases with and without the additional perpendicular injection, where E is evaluated as

The  X-mode  injection  increase  ne

2mm  and  E  by  about  15%  and  75%  compared  to  the  case  with 

oblique injection only, respectively. The radial profiles of ne and Te at t=110 ms with and without the 

perpendicular injection, and Pabs derived by eq.(1) are shown in Fig.5(b). The electron temperature is 

increased over the whole radial region by the perpendicular injection, where the ne profile remains 

unchanged  by  the  injection.  The  additional  perpendicular  injection  clearly  contributes  to  clear 

electron  heating.  Although  the  cutoff  layers  are  condensed  near  LCFS,  the  observed  absorption  of 

injection power widely takes place beyond these cutoff layers. The values of η and Cmax in the target 

plasma are respectively about 0.43 and 0.76 at the moment of the perpendicular injection. The total 

deposited  power  is  evaluated  to  be  about  5kW  across  the  power  step-up  (Pin~14kW),  and 

corresponds to be fairly high value of about 35% absorption rate.   

4. Conclusion 

 

 

  In  the  plasmas  generated  by  the  perpendicular  injection  microwaves  with  X-mode 

polarization at very low Bt (<0.1T) on CHS, the central electron temperature reaches around 20eV 

and electron density reaches more than twice or 3 times of the O-mode cutoff density. The power is 

absorbed  inside  the  over-dense  region.  The  results  are  interpreted  that  the  EBW  converted  from 

launched  X-mode  plays  an  essential  role  in  this  effective  electron  heating  and  over-dense  plasma 

12th International Congress on Plasma Physics, Nice, 2004 

production. So far, the power absorption efficiency is still low around 10 to 20% for the incidence 

power.  This  may  be  caused  by  worse  wave  directivity  and  opaque  polarization  of  incidence 

microwaves. Recently, we succeeded in raising the absorption efficiency by a factor of two by the 

use of the perpendicular injection of X-mode after the formation of relatively high density plasma 

having steep edge density gradient. 

As a future research, the following issues are left for important and challenging targets.   

1. Observation of parametric decay which will occur in X-B mode conversion process[11]. 

2. O-X-B conversion by launching obliquely O-mode. 

3. Comparison of experimentally observed absorption rate with theoretical results. 

4. Detailed power balance study including measurement of local radiation loss and neutral particle

Abstract 

Since  a  wider  aperture  has  been  obtained  along  the  Booster  beam  line,  this  opens  the 

opportunity  for  Booster  running  a  higher  intensity  beam  than  ever  before.    Sooner  or 

later,  the  available  RF  accelerating  voltage  will  become  a  new  limit  for  the  beam 

intensity.    Either  by  increasing  the  RFSUM  or  by  reducing  the  accelerating  rate  can 

achieve  the  similar  goal.    The  motivation  for  the  6-GeV  study  is  to  gain  the  relative 

accelerating voltage via a slower acceleration. 

Introduction 

After  the  Booster-lattice  distortion  caused  by  the  edge  focusing  of  dogleg  magnets  in 

extraction sections of long 3 and long 13 was largely removed via the rearrangement of 

spacing the magnets out, one expects that a much wider aperture will be available for the 

acceleration  of  higher  intensity  Booster  beams.    Also,  since  the  collimator  has  been 

effectively reducing the radiation loss (RL) after its installation, the chance that the RL 

becomes the limit for the highest beam intensity (HBI) is very small.  Sooner or later, the 

RF accelerating voltage (RFSUM) (VRF) from all the Booster RF stations,[1] especially at 

the transition crossing (TC), will become a crucial factor for determining the HBI.  The

reason is because the effective accelerating voltage (Veff) is equal to the sum of two parts 

(Va and VL), and it is the accelerating voltage seen by the beam, as shown by eq.1.

                                                                                                                  (1) 

Here,  φs  is  the  synchronous  phase,  which  is  the  phase  difference  between  the  RFSUM 

and the centroid of the circulating beam bunch (CB).[2]   

Va  is  the  accelerating  voltage  required  by  the  rate  of  change  of  the  Booster 

magnetic  field  (dB/dt)  in  a  cycle,  and  is  independent  of  the  beam  intensity.    VL  is  the 

beam  energy  loss,  which  is  caused  by  the  real  impedance  of  the  ring,  and  is  dependent 

upon the beam  current.[3]    The  higher the beam current is, the higher the beam energy 

loss is.  It is clear that Veff is limited by VRF.  The HBI is achieved whenever VL reaches 

the difference between VRF and Va in a cycle.  From past experience in the normal 8-GeV 

operation, this usually happens at the TC when ‘VRF -Va’ reaches its minimum while VL 

reaches its peak value.  This is because dB/dt reaches its peak at the TC, while the peak 

current of the beam reaches its maximum as a result of the shortest bunch length.             

Either  by  increasing  the  RFSUM  or  by  reducing  the  accelerating  rate,  the 

allowable energy loss, which is the difference between VRF and Va, will be increased, and 

also the HBI should be increased.  It is obvious that the maximum number of RF stations, 

which can be installed in Booster, together with the output of each station, constrain the 

upper  limit  of  VRF.    Another  way  of  increasing  ‘VRF  -Va’  is  to  reduce  Va  via  a  slower 

acceleration, and this is the motivation for the 6-GeV study. 

 

Experimental Result and Analysis 

All the relevant Booster ramps, which include the magnet ramp, the RF frequency ramp, 

the bias ramp, etc., were rescaled to the 6-GeV acceleration.  Also, some routine tunings, 

which  include  the  injection  tuning,  RF  curve  tuning,  quad  ramp  tuning,  etc.,  had  been 

performed before Booster reached a standard running condition.   

Afterwards, for the purpose of finding the relationship between the phase jump at 

the TC and the beam intensity, the synchronous phase detector was used to measure the 

φs right before the TC and right after the TC, and their difference gives the phase jump 

(∆φs).  Here, the Linac beam was injected at 0 ms, and the TC gate was set at 20.7 ms.

The  same  measurement  was  repeated  for  several  extracted  beam  intensities  and  also  at 

two different RFSUM curves, RFSUM 1 and RFSUM 2.  The results were compared to 

the  data  which  were  taken  at  the  8-GeV  operation.[5]    RFSUM  1,  RFSUM  2,  and 

RFSUM for the 8-GeV acceleration are shown as the black, red, and green curves in Fig. 

1(a) respectively.  Their corresponding ∆φs vs. the extracted beam intensity and linear-fit 

results  are  shown  in  Fig.  1(b).    The  operational  region  with  extracted  beam  intensities, 

which are less than or equal to 6×1012 protons, is indicated by the red rectangular in Fig. 

1(b). 

 

The  accelerating  voltages  required  by  dB/dt  for  the  6-GeV  acceleration  and  8-

GeV acceleration are shown as the black and red curves in Fig. 2(a) respectively.[2]  The 

synchronous phase and RFSUM were measured at extracted beam intensities of 4.1×1012 

protons,  3.6×1012  protons,  1.9×1012  protons,  0.35×1012  protons  when  Booster  was 

operated  at  RFSUM  1,  and  they  are  shown  in  Figs.  2(b)  and  2(c).    And  their  effective 

accelerating  voltages  (Veff)  per  beam  turn  (BT),  which  were  calculated  using  eq.1,  are 

shown  in  Fig.  2(d).    The  black,  red,  green,  and  blue  curves  in  each  plot  represent  the 

results for the several intensities from highest to lowest respectively.  The magenta curve 

in Fig. 2(d) is the same with the black curve in Fig. 2(a).  The intensity dependent part 

(IDP)  of  the  Veff,  which  is  equivalent  to  the  IDP  of  the  VL,  can  be  estimated  from 

differences  between  the  black  and  blue  curves,  the  red  and  blue  curves,  the  green  and 

blue curves in Fig. 2(d).  Furthermore, by taking the difference, the error coming from the 

offset  of  signals  VRF  and  φs  can  be  minimized,  and  their  differences  are  shown  as  the 

black, red, and green curves in Fig. 2(e) respectively.  The same procedure was applied to 

the  situation  when  Booster  was  operated  at  RFSUM  2.    The  Veff  at  extracted  beam 
intensities of 4.7×1012 protons, 3.8×1012 protons, 2.1×1012 protons, and 0.39×1012 protons 

are  shown  as  the  black,  red,  green  and  blue  curves  in  Fig.  2(f)  respectively,  and  the 

magenta curve is the same with the one in Fig. 2(d).  Differences between the black and 

blue curves, the red and blue curves, the green and blue curves in Fig. 2(f) are shown as 

the black, red, and green curves in Fig. 2(g).  The IDP of VL in the RFSUM 1 situation, as 

shown in Fig. 2(d), are similar to those in the RFSUM 2 case, as shown in Fig. 2(g).  This 

is what one expects, since there is an approximately linear relationship between the IDP 

of  VL  and  the  beam  intensity.    Unless  when  the  CB  gets  too  short  or  the  shape  of  the 

 

3

bunch is no longer smooth, high frequency components of the beam current couldn’t be 

neglected any more.   

 

The Veff difference between operations of RFSUM 1 and RFSUM 2 for the similar 

extracted beam intensity can give us some ideas of how to choose the optimal RFSUM 

curve in a cycle.  The smaller the Veff is, the less the effective VL is.  The Veff differences 
between RFSUM 1 and RFSUM 2 at extracted beam intensities of 3.7×1012 protons and 

0.36×1012  protons  are  shown  as  the  black  and  red  curves  in  Fig.  3(a).    It  is  clear  that 

RFSUM 1 is better than RFSUM 2 before the TC and is worse after the TC.  The green 

curve with arrows in Fig. 3(b) indicates what the likely optimal RFSUM curve might be.  

 

All  data  were  taken  under  similar  conditions  with  the  extracted  beam  intensity 

about 5.1×1012 protons when Booster was operated at RFSUM 2 of 6 GeV.  The method 

for determining the lower limit for RFSUM is to reduce it to the value at which the beam 

loss starts.[6]  In the experiment, the RFSUM limit was measured at 3.5 ms, 6.5 ms, 9.5 

ms, 12.5 ms, 15.5 ms, 18.5 ms, 21.5 ms, 24.5 ms, and 27.5 ms separately.  The RFSUM, 

the RFSUM limit, the Veff, and the Va are shown as the black, red, green, and blue curves 

respectively in Fig. 4(a).  The data at the 8-GeV operation for the similar beam intensity 

are  shown  in  Fig.  4(b)  for  the  purpose  of  comparison.[6]    It  is  clear  that  in  the  6-GeV 

acceleration,  there  are  more  RF  voltages  that  are  available  for  the  compensation  of  the 

beam energy loss, especially for the high intensity beam.    

 

RF  bucket  reduction  for  acquiring  information  about  the  particle  distribution  in 

longitudinal  phase  space  was  applied  for  the  extracted  beam  intensity  of  4.3×1012 

protons.[7]  We chose eight points, 3.5 ms, 6.5 ms, 9.5 ms, 12.5 ms, 18.5 ms, 21.5 ms, 

24.5 ms, and 27.5 ms in a Booster cycle to do the measurement.  At 3.5 ms, RFSUM was 

reduced to nine different values, as shown in Fig. 5(a), and their corresponding charges, 

which  were  left  in  the  RF  bucket,  were  recorded  as  Fig.  5(b).    Also,  the  synchronous 

phase  was  recorded  at  three  different  RFSUM  values,  and  they  were  used  to  find  the 
relationship  between  the  RFSUM  value  and  synchronous  phase  via  the  2nd  order 

polynomial fit, and the result is shown in Fig. 5(c).  The RFSUM and the synchronous 

phase vs. charge are shown as the black and blue curves respectively in Fig. 5(d).  Eq.2 is 

used to calculate the bucket area (A) in unit of eV×s.[8]

Here, β  is  the  Lorentz’s  relativistic  factor,  frf  is  the  RF  frequency, η  is  the  phase  slip 

factor,  Es  is  the  kinetic  energy,  h  is  the  harmonic  number  of  the  rf  frequency,  e  is  the 

electron charge, and α(φs) is the ratio of the bucket area with φs relative to the stationary 

bucket  area  (either  φs=0°,  or  φs=180°).[8]    The  charge  vs.  bucket  area  is  shown  in  Fig. 

5(e).  The differentiation of the charge over the bucket area gives the charge density in 

the bucket area, as shown in Fig. 5(f).  The same procedure was applied for getting the 

relationship between the charge density and the bucket area at the rest time of the cycle, 

and the results  are shown  in Figs. 5(g)-5(m).  The charge-density fluctuation inside the 

bucket  area  appeared  strongly  right  after  the  TC,  as  shown  in  Fig.  5(k),  lasted  till  24.5 

ms, and was smoothed at 27.5 ms.   

Comment 

The  effective  accelerating  voltage  was  reduced  at  the  6-GeV  acceleration  since  the 

accelerating  rate  was  reduced  in  the  6-GeV  cycle  compared  to  the  8-GeV  cycle.  

However, the intensity-dependent part of the energy loss, or called the AC component of 

the  energy  loss,  does  not  vary  significantly  from  8-GeV  acceleration  to  6-GeV 

acceleration and from one RFSUM curve to another, as shown in Fig. 2(e) and Fig. 2(g).  

The  intensity-independent  part  of  the  energy  loss,  or  called  the  DC  component  of  the 

energy loss, does depend upon the RFSUM curve, as shown in Fig. 3(a).  So optimizing 

the RFSUM curve still will be helpful for reducing the DC component of the energy loss.  

The  strong  charge  density  fluctuation  in  the  bucket  right  after  the  TC,  which  is  likely 

caused by the mismatch of the beam in the bucket before and after the TC, might be the 

intrinsic  property  of  the  Booster  RF  system,  including  LLRF  and  HLRF,  and  this  only 

can  be  fixed  by  upgrading  the  RF  system  or  commissioning  the  γt  jump  system  for  the 

purpose of making the TC faster.

Nonlinear mode coupling in a coaxial waveguide filled with Faraday material has 

been considered. The picture of mode interaction is shown to resemble Coulomb 

interaction  of  charges:  higher  modes  with  nonzero  angular  momentum  interact 

like  effective  charges  via  exchange  of  zero  angular  momentum  quanta  of  the 

fundamental mode. Thus, at large distances this interaction becomes the dominant 

mechanism  of  mode  coupling.  The  developed  model  may  be  used  in  designing 

coaxial photonic crystal fibers with strong tailored mode interaction.

Optical  fiber  communication,  all-optical  signal  processing,  and  many  other  fields  of  optics 

require understanding of mode interaction in a guiding optical fiber or waveguide. As a result, 

considerable efforts have been put into the mode coupling modeling and calculations. In general, 

these  model  calculations  require  extensive  numerical  efforts  and  are  very  difficult  to  analyze 

analytically.    

 

Very  recently  [1]  consideration  of  cylindrical  surface  plasmon  mode  coupling  in  metal 

nanowires  and  nanoholes  has  led  to  the  introduction  of  analytical  picture  of  mode  coupling  in 

these systems, which strongly resembles Coulomb interaction of electric charges. In this picture 

higher  (n  >  0)  cylindrical  surface  plasmon  (CSP)  modes  are  shown  to  posses  a  quantized 

effective charge proportional to their angular momentum n. In a metal nanowire these relatively 

slow moving effective charges exhibit strong long-range interaction  via exchange  of fast CSPs 

with  zero  angular  momentum  (n=0).  Such  a  mode-coupling  picture  leads  to  a  quasi  one-

dimensional Coulomb interaction of higher CSP modes, which becomes rather strong over long 

distances along the metal nanowire.   

 

In this paper I am going to show that the geometry of electric and magnetic fields of the 

optical modes in a coaxial waveguide filled with Faraday material is very similar to the geometry 

of CSP modes in a metal nanowire. Thus, similar (cid:147)effective charges(cid:148) picture of nonlinear mode 

interaction may be built in the case of mode coupling in a coaxial waveguide filled with Faraday 

material.  Moreover,  the  developed  model  may  be  used  in  designing  coaxial  photonic  crystal 

fibers  with  similar  picture  of  mode  interaction.  Thus,  special  fibers  may  be  designed  which 

exhibit tailored, strong, and analytically clear picture of mode interaction.

Let  us  first  consider  a  coaxial  waveguide  (Fig.1)  filled  with  a  transparent  isotropic 

material, which exhibits magnetic field induced optical activity (a Faraday material). In such a 

chiral material the relationship between the D and E vectors looks like [2]

where  the  constant  f  may  be  either  positive  or  negative.  Similar  to  the  n=0  cylindrical  surface 

plasmon  mode  of  a  metal  nanowire,  the  quanta  of  the  fundamental  mode  of  the  coaxial 

waveguide may be considered as the quanta of the effective angular rotation field Ω :

(where c is the speed of light), which may be defined locally for any chiral medium regardless of 

the  nature  of  its  optical  activity  (natural  or  magnetic  field  induced)  [1].      This  statement  is 

evident from the fact that the oscillating axially symmetric magnetic field Hφ of the fundamental 

mode of the coaxial waveguide corresponds to small oscillations of Ω  (here it is also important 

to  emphasize  that  the  fundamental  mode  of  the  coaxial  waveguide  has  no  cut-off  frequency).  

Thus,  when  a  relatively  slow  moving  compact  wave  packet  of  a  higher  guided  mode  of  the 

coaxial waveguide (with nonzero total angular momentum L) experiences the action of the low 

frequency fundamental mode (Fig.2),  such a wave packet acquires additional energy ∆E=LΩ. 

This  statement  can  be  confirmed  by  considering  the  behavior  of  the  solutions  of  Maxwell 

equations in the presence of the axial gyration field gφ = gφ (r,z,t). After simple calculations the 

wave equation can be written in the form

which  is  similar  to  the  Klein-Gordon  equation,  where  n  and  g/r  play  the  role  of  the  effective 

(cid:147)electric(cid:148)  charge  ,  and  the  effective  potential,  respectively  [1]  (here  it  is  important  to  mention 

that for such higher guided modes iEz~Bz, where the coefficient of proportionality is determined 

by the boundary conditions).  

 

On the other hand, solution of the nonlinear Maxwell equations indicates that the modes 

with higher angular momentum (the effective charges) behave as the sources of the field of the 

fundamental mode. Let us search for the solutions of the nonlinear Maxwell equation (4) of the 

form B=B0+Bn and E=E0+En, where B0 and Bn are the fundamental mode and the n>0 guided 

mode, respectively, and the gyration field is obtained in a self-consistent manner as g=f(B0+Bn). 

We  are  interested  in  the  solution  for  the  field  B0  in  the  limit  of  small  frequencies  ω0      in  the 

presence of  Bn field, so that in the found solution the Bn field will act as a source of B0.  After 

neglecting  the  terms  proportional  to  f2,  and  taking  into  account  that  B0  and  Bn      are  incoherent 

solutions of linear Maxwell equations we obtain

where Sn is the Pointing vector of the n-th mode. This equation is somewhat similar to the 

Poisson equation for electric charges. Moreover, using vector calculus theorem we can also 

derive an analog of the Gauss theorem for our effective (cid:147)chiral(cid:148) charges. Let us consider a 

cylindrical volume V around the coaxial waveguide (see Fig.3), such that the side wall of the

volume V is located very far from the waveguide and the electromagnetic field is zero at this 

wall. If S is the closed two-dimensional cylindrical surface bounding V, with area element da and 

unit outward normal n at da, and S1 and S2 are the front and the back surfaces of V, we can write 

the following integral equation for the Pointing vector Sn of the n-th mode:

,  we  see  that  a  (cid:147)chiral  charge(cid:148)  produces  a  local  step  in  the  gyration 

field. Thus, the (cid:147)chiral charges(cid:148) interact according to the one-dimensional Coulomb law with the 

interaction energy growing linearly with distance. In reality this idealized linear growth is cut off 

by the absorption in the waveguide. However, at small frequencies of the fundamental mode the 

absorption is small and the range of chiral interaction is large. In fact, this unusual long-range 

nonlinear optical mode interaction should become the most important at large distances between 

the  wave  packets  of  higher  modes.  The  numerical  estimate  made  for  a  cylindrical  surface 

plasmon case [1] indicates that large nonlinear effects may be observed. 

 

It is also important to mention that the described mechanism of mode interaction may be 

realized in coaxial photonic crystal fibers in which the light is guided in the coaxial gap between 

the central and the outer photonic crystal structures. Introduction of metal wire inside the central 

photonic crystal region and the coaxial metal cylinder outside the outer photonic crystal region 

(Fig.4)  creates  the  cut-off-free  fundamental  mode  similar  to  the  fundamental  mode  of  a  usual 

coaxial waveguide. On the other hand, the inner and outer photonic crystal region should limit 

 

5

the  optical  absorption  of  the  guided  modes  at  higher  frequencies.    Such  a  combined  coaxial 

photonic crystal waveguide may be an extremely valuable tool in all-optical signal processing.

Abstract 

Small  angle neutron scattering (SANS) on the unilamellar vesicle populations (diameter 500 Å 
and  1000  Å)  was  used  to  characterize  lipid  vesicles  from  dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine  (DMPC)  at 
three  phases  (gel,  ripple,  and  liquid).  Parameters  of  vesicle  populations  and  internal  structure  of  the 
DMPC  bilayer  were  characterized  on  the  basis  of  the  Separated  Form  Factor  (SFF)  model.  Vesicle 
shape changes from about spherical in the liquid phase to elliptical in the ripple and gel ones. It is true 
for  vesicles  prepared  via  extrusion  through  pores with the diameter 500 Å. Parameters of the internal 
bilayer structure (thickness of the membrane and the hydrophobic core, hydration, and surface area of 
lipid  molecule)  were  determined  on  the  basis  of  the  Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic  (HH) approximation of 
neutron scattering length density across the bilayer r (x) and of the Step Function (SF) approximation of 
r (x).  It  was  demonstrated  in  frame  of  HH  approximation  that  DMPC  membrane  thickness  in  liquid 
phase (T = 30oC) depends on the membrane curvature. Prepared via extrusion through 500 Å diameter 
the  following  characteristics:  average  radius  of  275.6– 0.5 Å, 
pores,  vesicle  population  has 
polydispersity  27%,  thickness  of  membrane  47.8– 0.2 Å  and  of  hydrophobic  core  20.5– 0.3 Å,  surface 
area 61.0– 0.4 Å2 and number of water molecules 11.9– 0.3 per DMPC molecule. Vesicles prepared via 
extrusion  through  pores  with  the  diameter  1000 Å  have  polydispersity  of  48  %,  and  a  membrane 
thickness of 45.6– 0.2 Å. SF approximation was used to describe the DMPC membrane structure in gel 
(T = 10 oC) and ripple (T = 20 oC) phases. DMPC vesicles prepared via extrusion through 1000 Å pores 
were  found  to  have  membrane  thickness  of  49.6– 0.5 Å  in  the  gel  phase  and  48.3– 0.6 Å  in  the  ripple 
phase. The dependence of the DMPC membrane thickness on temperature was restored from the SANS 
experiment.  
 

Introduction 

Phospholipids  are  the  main  components  of  cell  membranes.  Research  in  the  structure  of 
 
phospholipids is important from a viewpoint of structural biology and biochemistry. Unilamellar vesicles 
are especially interesting because most of biological membranes are unilamellar. Function and properties 
of  integral  membrane  proteins  depend  on  the  lipid  bilayer  structure.  On  the  other  hand,  unilamellar 
vesicles are also used as delivery agents for drugs. Knowledge of their structure in nanoscale region is 
important for pharmacology (Nagayasu et al. 1999, Cevc et al. 2002).  

Dynamic and static light scattering are commonly used to characterize the form and size of vesicles. 
However,  these  methods  have  the  limitation  of  obtaining  information  about  the  thickness  and  the 
internal  structure  of  the  membrane  bilayer  (Pencer  et  al.  2001,  Jin  et  al.  1999).  Main  part  of  modern 
knowledge  about  internal  structure  of  phospholipids  in  liquid  and  gel  phases  was  obtained  by  X-ray 
diffraction on the giant multilamellar vesicles, which have negligibly small membrane curvature (Nagle 
and Tristram-Nagle 2000). In many works SANS have been used to characterize the bilayer structure of 
the unilamellar vesicles at high excess of water. Membrane thickness can be found from experimentally 
measured  radius  of  gyration  of  the  bilayer by using Guinier approximation (Feigin and Svergun 1987; 
Knoll et al. 1981; Gordeliy et al. 1993; Balgavy et al. 1998). Calculations of bilayer parameters from the 
radius  of  gyration  are  based  on  the  part  of  SANS  curve  in  the  interval  of  scattering  vector  q  from 
0.03Å-1 to 0.14Å-1. This approach was used to calculate the bilayer thickness and lipid surface area of 
the  DMPC  membrane  in  liquid  phase  on  the  base  of  Strip  Function  model  of  the  neutron  scattering 
length density (Kucerka et al. 2004). The electron density profile or the one of neutron scattering length 
density  is  calculated  by  Fourier  transformation  from  diffraction  peaks  intensities  in  the  diffraction 
experiment  on  the  multilamellar  vesicles  or  oriented  dry  membranes  (Wiener  and  White  1991;  Nagle 
and Tristram-Nagle 2000; Tristram-Nagle et al. 2002). Accuracy of the structure determination depends 
on the space resolution of the scattering experiment

where  du  is  repeat  membrane  thickness  and  hm  is  maximum  diffraction  order  (Kiselev  et  al.  2005).  In 
access water, the DMPC membrane has du = 62.7 Å at T = 30oC and D x = 4.7 Å for the hm = 8. In the 
SANS experiment, the coherent scattering intensity of vesicle population can be measured to qm »
 0.3 Å-
1. This gives a resolution D x = 10.5 Å of the Fourier transformation, which limits an application of the 
indirect  Fourier  transformation  for  the  evaluation  of  the  internal  membrane  structure  from  SANS 
experiment  (Glatter  1977;  Glatter  1980). Design of appropriate scattering models and approximations 
of  the  scattering  length  density  across  the  bilayer  r (x)  (based  on  some  preliminary  knowledge  about 
bilayer  structure)  could  improve  the  space  resolution  in  the  evaluation  of  the  internal  membrane 
structure  from  SANS  experiment.  The  model  of  randomly  oriented  planar  bilayer  was  applied  for 
identifying  of  the  membrane  thickness  and  the  internal  membrane  structure  (Pencer  and  Hallet  2000; 
Kucerka  et  al.  2004).  Step  Function  (SF)  approximation  of  r (x)  was  applied  for  the  investigation  of 
oligolamellar  vesicles  (Schmiedel  et  al.  2001).  This  approach  could  be  used  to  obtain  additional 
information about membrane repeat distance and percentage of nonunilamellar vesicles. 

Other  important  information  about  vesicle  population  concerns  average  vesicle  radius  and 
polydispersity.  Hollow  Sphere  (HS)  model  was  applied  for  the  calculation  of  vesicle  radius,  vesicle 
polydispersity, membrane thickness and internal membrane structure (Kiselev et al. 2001; Balgavy et al. 
2001). The application of HS model gives possibility to describe the internal membrane structure as two 
or three regions with constant scattering length density via SF approximation of the r (x). HS model has 
two principal drawbacks: a) it can be used only for spherical shape of vesicles, b) r (x) can be described 
only  as  step  function,  whereas  neutron  diffraction  experiments  demonstrate  that  r (x)  has  a  more 
complex and smooth shape (Wiener and White 1991; Gordeliy and Kiselev 1995). 

A  model  of  Separated  Form  Factors  (SFF)  allows  simulating  of  r (x),  using  almost  any  functions, 
which significantly expands the possibilities of studying the internal membrane structure (Kiselev et al. 
2002).  Calculated  within  it  parameters  were:  the  average  vesicle  radius  <R>,  the  relative  standard 
deviation of radius (polydispersity) s , the thicknesses of membrane d, of hydrophobic part of bilayer D, 
and of hydrophilic part (D-d)/2, as well as the number of water molecules within a bilayer per DMPC 
molecule nw. (Zemlyanaya and Kiselev 2002; Zemlyanaya et al. 2005). The parameters of DMPC vesicle 
form  at  T = 30  oC  do  not  depend  sufficiently  on  the  different  functions  used  for  modeling  r (x): 
 0.4  Å  and  s    = 27%  (Zemlyanaya  and  Kiselev  2002;  Zemlyanaya  et  al.  2005), 
<R> = 275 –
<R> = 272 –
 0.4  Å  and  s    = 27%  (Kiselev  et  al.  2004).  However,  the  values  of  d,  D,  and  nw  are 
sensitive to the type of function r (x) (Kiselev et al. 2004, Kucerka et al, 2004).  

In  the  case  of  homogeneous  approximation,  r (x) = const,  D2O penetration into the bilayer makes 
part of the hydrophilic region invisible relative to the bulk D2O (Kiselev et al. 2004). Therefore, the case 
of  r (x) = const  gives  underestimated  value  of  d = 36.70 –
 0.02 Å  for  DMPC  vesicles  at  T = 30oC 
(Zemlyanaya  et  al.  2005).  Calculations,  based  on  the  SF  approximation  of  r (x),  result  in  more 
reasonable  value  d = 46.4 –
 0.03 Å  and  an  additional  introduction  of  the  linear  water  distribution 
function  in  hydrophilic  region  of  DMPC  increases  the  membrane  thickness  d = 47.4 –
 0.04 Å 
(Zemlyanaya  et  al.  2005).  Generation  of r (x)  based on the Gaussian functions gives d = 50.6 –
 0.8 Å 
(Kiselev et al. 2004). 

Water distribution function across the bilayer has sigmoidal form (Armen et al. 1998, Kiselev et al, 
2004).  In  liquid  phase,  the  contribution  from  the  D2O  distribution  function  to  the  integrated  neutron 
scattering length density of DMPC is sufficiently larger than the one from the polar head group (Kiselev 
et  al.  2004).  Competition  between  contributions  of  D2O  and  polar  head  groups  to  the  integrated 
neutron  scattering  length  density  allows  one  to  simplify  the  approximation  of  r (x)  and  decrease  the 
number of fit parameters.  

In present work, the SFF model is used to analyze the structure of the polydispersed population of 
DMPC vesicles in gel, liquid, and crystalline phases as studied by SANS. Two types of r (x) functions 
are used for the evaluation of bilayer parameters, which depend on the bilayer hydration. Parameters of

 for elliptical shape) and of bilayer (d, D, 
nw) are calculated for the case of vesicles prepared via extrusion through 500 Å and 1000 Å diameter 
pores.  The  presented  methods  show  what  we  can  learn  about  vesicle  structure  from  the  SANS 
experiment on other types of lipid vesicles and vesicular based drug delivery systems.  

  

Materials and methods 

Sample preparation 

 
DMPC was a gift from Lipoid (Moscow, Russia). D2O (99.9% deuteration) was purchased from 
Isotop  (St.  Petersburg,  Russia).  Samples  for  measurements  were  prepared  by  conventional  extrusion 
technique. Heavy water and DMPC were mixed in a plastic tube and the tube was sealed. The DMPC 
concentration in the sample was 15mM (about 1 wt. %). The tube content was heated to a temperature 
 20  (cid:176) C.  The 
above  the  main  phase  transition  temperature  and  then  cooled  down  to  about  -
cooling-heating cycle, accompanied by sample shaking, was repeated four times. From the dispersion of 
multilamellar  vesicles  thus  obtained,  extruded  unilamellar  vesicles  were  prepared  in  a  single  -  step 
procedure according to (MacDonald et al. 1991) using the LiposoFast Basic extruder (Avestin, Ottawa, 
Canada). The multilamellar vesicle populations were prepared by extrusion through one polycarbonate 
filter (Nucleopore, Plesanton, USA) with pores of 500 Å (namely 500 Å extruded vesicles) or 1000  Å 
(namely 1000 Å extruded vesicles) diameter, mounted in the extruder fitted with two gas-tight Hamilton 
syringes  (Hamilton,  Reno,  USA).  The  sample  was  subjected  to  25  passes  through  the  filter  at  a 
temperature higher than the main phase transition temperature of the DMPC. An odd number of passes 
were performed to avoid contamination of the sample by large and multilamellar vesicles, which might 
not  have  passed  through  the  filter.  The  sample  was  filled  into  a  quartz  cuvette  (Hellma,  Müllheim, 
Germany) with a 2 mm sample thickness.

SANS measurements 

SANS  spectra  were  collected  from  unilamellar  vesicles  as  function  of  temperature  in  the 
 
temperature interval 10 -
 60oC in the range of scattering vector q from 0.02 Å-1 to 0.15 Å-1 (Ostanevich 
1988) at YuMO small-angle time of flight spectrometer of Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics (JINR, 
Dubna,  Russia).  Spectra  were  also  obtained  at  T = 10oC,  20oC,  and  30oC  at  SANS-1 spectrometer of 
the Swiss Spallation Neutron Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI), Switzerland. Three sample-to-
detector  distances  2 m,  6 m,  and  20 m  were  used  to  obtain  the SANS data over a wide q range from 
0.0033 Å-1 to 0.56 Å-1. Neutron wavelength was 4.7 Å.  

Evaluation of vesicle parameters from SANS curve  

Simplest  method  of  membrane  thickness  characterization  is  Guinier  approximation  of  scattering 
curve  (Feigin  and  Svergun  1987;  Knoll  et  al.  1981;  Gordeliy  et  al.  1993;  Balgavy  et  al.  1998).  The 
macroscopic cross section of vesicle population with R > d can be presented as (Gutberlet et al. 2000)

for the case of large value of contrast, when scattering length density of D2O is larger than the average

scattering length density of the bilayer. It is true for the case of “dry” bilayer, when penetration of D2O 
molecules  inside  the  bilayer  is  negligibly  small  (Ibel  and  Stuhrmann  1975,  Gordeliy  et  al.  1993).  For 
DMPC  vesicles  in  D2O,  the  penetration  of  water  molecules  into  the  hydrophilic  part  of  the  bilayer 
influences the scattering length density distribution (Kiselev et al. 2004, Zemlyanaya et al. 2005). That 
is why dG is smaller relative to the real membrane thickness d (Balgavy et al. 1998, Kiselev et al. 2001). 
Values of dG and d are different on some constant D dH depending on a membrane type and hydration

A model of separated form factors (SFF) was proposed for an evaluation of the vesicle radius, the

polydispersity m, and thickness of the lipid bilayer d are fitting parameters. There are some others too: 
average  vesicle  radius  <R>  for  spherical  vesicles  or  average  value  of  minor  semi-axis  <a>  along  with 
eccentricity  e   for  elliptical  vesicles,  as  well  as  parameters  of  function  r (x),  depicting  the  neutron

 0.8  Å  at  T = 20  oC.  The  value  of  dG  of  38.8 –

Figure  1  presents  the  dependence  of  the  DMPC  membrane  thickness  parameter  dG  on 
temperature. DMPC vesicles were prepared by extrusion through pores with diameter 1000 Å. SANS 
spectra  were  collected  at  YuMO  spectrometer.  Values  of  dG  were  evaluated  in  the  Guinier  plot  via 
Equations (3) and (4). Membrane thickness parameter dG is found to be 44.2 –
 0.8 Å at T = 10 oC and 
43.4 –
 0.8  Å  at  T = 30  oC  was  calculated  via  data 
extrapolation  in Figure 1. These values of dG underestimates the membrane thickness d relative to the 
data from X-ray diffraction experiment which are 48.2 Å at T = 10  oC and 44.2 Å at T = 30  oC (Nagle 
and Tristram-Nagle 2000, Tristram-Nagle et al. 2002). The value of D dH in Equation (5) is equal to 4 Å 
in the gel and 5.4  Å in the liquid phase of DMPC, which reflects larger DMPC hydration in the liquid 
phase.  Guinier  approximation  describes  the  relative  changes  in  the  membrane  thickness  under

main  phase  transition  temperature  of  23oC.  The  membrane  thickness  decreases  on  the  value  of 
5.4 –

DMPC vesicles in the liquid crystalline phase, the HH approximation of rrrr (x)  

The hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HH) approximation of the internal bilayer structure is used as r (x) 
function in the liquid phase of DMPC (Schmiedel et al. 2004). It is based on the fact that the scattering 
length  density  of  D2O  molecules  in  the  hydrophilic  region  of  bilayer  is  sufficiently  larger  then  the 
scattering  length  density  of  polar  head  groups  in  liquid  phase  of  DMPC  (Kiselev  et  al.  2004).  HH 
approximation of r (x) is presented in Figure 2. Lipid bilayer consists of the two parts: hydrophobic and 
hydrophilic. Linear approximation is used for the water distribution function in the hydrophilic region, 
where  r D2O =  6.4(cid:215) 1010(cid:0) m-2  and r
 0.36(cid:215) 1010(cid:0) m-2  are  fixed  parameters  (Schmiedel  et  al.  2001, 
Zemlyanaya et al. 2005). The parameters of the DMPC bilayer determined from the SANS curve are the 
membrane thickness d and the thickness of hydrophobic part D.

Figure 4 shows the experimentally measured and fitted SANS curves for the DMPC unilamellar 
vesicles at T = 30  oC. Unilamellar vesicles were prepared by extrusion through pores with diameter of 
500 Å.  Experimentally  measured  macroscopic  cross  section  was  calculated  by  two  different  methods: 
by application of the exact expression for scattering amplitude using Equation (8) and by application of 
the SFF model using Equation (9). This allows one to check a validity of the SFF model and estimate 
the  contribution  of  the  second  term  in  Equation  (8).  The  obtained  parameters  are  given  in  Table  1. 
Parameters of vesicle populations and internal membrane structure evaluated by exact expression and by 
SFF model for scattering amplitude coincide exactly. Consequently, the second term in the Equation 8 
is negligibly small for vesicles with <R> ‡

 250 Å.  

For 500 Å extruded vesicles, the obtained value of <R> = 275.6±0.5 Å is in the agreement with 
radius of the pores (250 Å) used during vesicle extrusion. Membrane thickness d, evaluated on the base 
of the HH approximation of r (x), is equal to 47.8±0.2 Å.  Whereas, thickness of the hydrophobic region 

D is 20.5±0.3 Å and of membrane hydrophilic part - 

=13.7±0.5 Å.  The latter is larger than

Nagle  2000),  or  DPH = 8.1±1.7 Å,  evaluated  from  SANS  (Kiselev  et  al.  2004).  This result shows that 
water  molecules  penetrate  into  the  hydrocarbon  chain  region  on  the  4.7  Å.  The  value  of  membrane 
thickness  d = 47.8±0.2 Å  is  3.6 Å  larger  than  d = 44.2 Å  evaluated  from  X-ray  diffraction  experiment 
on  the  giant  multilamellar  vesicles  (Nagle  and  Tristram-Nagle  2000).  The  number  of  water  molecules 
Nw = 11.9– 0.3 and surface area A = 61.0– 0.4 Å2 of the DMPC molecule differ from Nw = 7.2 and A = 
59.6 Å2 for the giant multilamellar vesicles (Nagle and Tristram-Nagle 2000). Hydration and membrane 
thickness of the curved DMPC bilayer are larger relative to the flat bilayer.  

The form of vesicles in the liquid phase cannot be ideally spherical. Probably, the vesicle shape 
fluctuates  near  the  spherical  form.  These  fluctuations  serve  as  origins  of  the  unilamellar  vesicle 
deformation and orientation in the strong magnetic field. Unilamellar vesicles’ deformation in the strong 
magnetic field 4T has been detected via SANS (Kiselev, unpublished). The elliptical form of the vesicle 
shape can be taken into account on the base of Equation (12). Table 2 presents the results for the case 
of 500 Å extruded vesicles, assuming that their form is elliptical. The value of eccentricity is 1.1, which 
demonstrates  that  vesicle  shape  is  near  to  the  spherical.  Nevertheless,  the  membrane  thickness  has  a 
value of 48.9– 0.2 Å at e =1.1 in comparison with d =  47.8– 0.2 Å for e =0.  

Important  membrane  parameter  is  the  thickness  of  the  polar  head group dPH . The information 
about dPH  is hard to be obtained in the frame of the HH approximation. Large value of scattering length 
density  of  D2O  molecules  screens  the  contribution  from  scattering  length  density  of  the  polar  head 
groups  (Kiselev  et  al.  2004).  Fitting  procedure  with  r (x)  as  sum  of  linear  and  step  functions  gives 
d = 47.4±0.2 Å and D = 17.3±0.5 Å (Zemlyanaya et al. 2005). The number of fitting parameters could 
be reduced by constrained value of dPH  = 9 Å (Kucerka et al. 2004). This approach gives d = 44.5±0.3 
Å,  Nw  =  6.8– 0.3,  and  A  =  58.9– 0.8  Å2  at  fitting  of  SANS  curve  in  the  range  of  q  from  0.03 Å-1  to 
0.14 Å-1. An accuracy of the membrane thickness evaluation depends on a possibility to collect SANS 
curve in the region of q corresponding to the bilayer form factor Fb(q,d). Roughly, the first minimum of 

Fb(q,d) corresponds to 

qm

, and for d = 45 Å qm = 0.14 Å-1. Evaluation of the bilayer parameters 

p2=
d

could be improved by the measurements of SANS curve with maximum value of scattering vector qmax 
about 0.3 Å-1 as seen from the insert in Fig. 3. Data acquisition in the q range from 0.30 Å-1 to 0.56 Å-1 
is necessary for the evaluation of the incoherent background IB. Determination of IB, as fit parameter, 
improves an accuracy of the membrane thickness evaluation from SANS curve (Schmiedel et al. 2001). 
The enlargement of qmax from 0.2 Å-1 to 0.56 Å-1 changes the value of d from 42.5±0.3 Å to 47.4±0.2 Å 
and the value of D from 11.0– 0.9 to 17.3±0.5 Å (Zemlyanaya et al. 2005).  

Membrane thickness d = 45.5±0.6 Å is found for the unilamellar vesicles prepared by extrusion 
through pores with diameter 1000 Å. This value of membrane thickness is in the better agreement with 
d = 44.2  Å  obtained  for  giant  multilamellar  vesicles.  Vesicles  prepared  via  extrusion  through  pores 
500 Å  and  1000 Å  are  different  in  the  membrane  curvature  and  the  polydispersity.  The  polydispersity 
(relative  standard  deviation  of  radius)  increases  from  27%  to  47%  on  increasing  of  vesicle  radius  as 
seen  from  Fig. 4.  Evaluated  value  of  the  average  vesicle  radius  <R>=314.6– 0.7  is  sufficiently  smaller 
than  the  radius  of  the  polycarbonate  pores  (500 Å)  and  should  be  considered  as  an  artifact.  Dynamic 
light scattering (DLS) and freeze-fracture electron microscopy results show that average vesicle radius 
after  extrusion  is  about  the  radius  of  the  pores  (MacDonald  et  al.  1991,  Hallet  et al. 1991, Patty and 
Frisken,  2003).  The  underestimation  of  the  vesicle  radius  for  1000Å  extruded  vesicles  has  different 
reasons.  First  reason  is  a  big  value  of  the  vesicles  polydispersity  (48%)  relative  to  the  one  of  500 Å 
extruded  vesicles  (27%).  Second  one  is  an  accuracy  of  the  correction  for  spectrometer  resolution. 
According  to  equation  (10),  positioning  of  first  minimum  in  the  form  factor  of  infinitely  thin  sphere 

depends on the vesicle radius as

q1000 = 0.0063 Å-1  for  those  with  1000 Å.  Figure 5  demonstrates  similar  shift  of  qR  for  two  types  of 
polydispersed  vesicle  populations  of  500 Å  and  1000 Å  extruded  vesicles.  The  relative  standard 

deviation  of  the  spectrometer  resolution  function

0.0063 Å-1,  and  0.0126 Å-1,  respectively  (Pedersen  et  al.  1990).  For  1000 Å  extruded  vesicles,  the 
accuracy  of  the  Equation  (16)  decreases  in  the  q  region,  which  is  important  for  the  evaluation  of 
vesicles radius. Value of q1000 = 0.0063 Å-1 is not so far from the value of qmin = 0.0033 Å-1, scattering 
curve has only five experimental points between these two values. Measurements of the scattering curve 
with qmin << 0.0033 Å-1 and better spectrometer resolution are necessary for the correct evaluation of 
the  average  vesicle  radius  ‡
  500Å.  Third  possible  reason  for  the  underestimation  of  1000Å  extruded 
vesicle  radius  can  be  in  a  difference  between  the  distribution  statistics  of  500Å  and  1000Å  extruded 
vesicles.  Nonsymmetrical  Schulz  distribution  well  describes  the  500Å  extruded  vesicles  population. 
Weibull  or  some  other  nonsymmetrical  distribution  could  be  more  suitable  for  the  characterization  of 
the vesicles population prepared via extrusion through 1000Å pores (Korgel et al. 1998). In any case, 
careful study of vesicle form and distribution requires the more powerful SANS instrument as discussed 
above for 1000 Å extruded vesicles.  

Decreasing of bilayer thickness at diminishing of the membrane curvature reduces the number of 
water  molecules  Nw from 11.9– 0.3 to 10.8– 0.3 and increases the surface area A from 61.0– 0.4 Å2 to 
62.6– 1.0 Å2,  whereas,  the  hydrophobic  thickness  D  stays  unchanged  under  the  membrane  curvature 
alteration.  The  structure  and  hydration  of  curved  DMPC  bilayer  in  the  liquid  phase  depend  on  the 
membrane curvature. The bilayer thickness and hydration are altered at increasing of vesicle radius to its 
values for the flat bilayer.  

It is known that unilamellar DMPC vesicles do not comprise a time-stable system. (Kiselev et al. 
2003b). The membrane thickness and the hydration undergo alteration during system equilibration from 
the non-stable unilamellar vesicles population to the static state of the multilamellar one. Probably, the 
hydration of the DMPC bilayer is driving force in the transformation of the unilamellar vesicles to the 
multilamellar ones.  
 
DMPC vesicles in the liquid crystalline phase, the SF approximation of rrrr (x) 

SF approximation of scattering length density across the lipid bilayer r (x) is shown in Figure 3. 
The thickness of polar head group dPH  = 9 Å was fixed as in the calculations done earlier (Kucerka et 
al. 2004). Vesicle shape is considered as spherical. The difference, relative to calculations in (Kucerka et 
al. 2004), is expressed in free value of the scattering length density in the region of polar head group, 
r PH. The fitting parameters of the lipid bilayer are d and r PH. This allows one to make a calculation of 
water  molecules  located  in  the  polar  head  group  region  Nw,  PH  and  the  surface  area  A,  taking  into 
account that for SF approximation the average scattering length density of hydrated DMPC is defined

The calculated parameters are given in Table  3. Inside of the SF approximation, the membrane 
thickness  d  =  45.5±0.7 Å  does  not  show  dependence  on  the  membrane  curvature  and  is  the  same  as 
membrane  thickness  calculated  based  on  the  HH  approximation  for  1000  Å  extruded  vesicles.  Both 
obtained values of the membrane thickness are larger than those of the giant multilamellar vesicles (44.2 
Å). Other fitted and calculated parameters for 500 Å and 1000 Å extruded vesicles are the same within 
the  experimental  errors.  Two  calculated  values  of  Nw,  PH  =  6.8– 0.6  and  Nw,  PH  =  8.0– 0.6  are  in  good 
agreement with data for giant multilamellar vesicles 7.2 (Nagle and Tristram-Nagle 2000). Finally, the 
average value Nw, PH =7.4 –
 0.6 can characterize the number of water molecules in the polar head group 
of DMPC at 30oC. Comparison of the hydration calculated by HH and SF approximations allows one to 
calculate the number of water molecules in the region of hydrocarbon chains as 4.5 –
 0.9 for 500 Å and 
3.4  –
  0.9  for  1000 Å  extruded  vesicles.  Probably,  the  decrease  of  membrane  curvature  reduces  the 
hydration of the hydrocarbon chains. But more precise experiments and data are necessary to check it. 
Surface area A, calculated based on the SF approximation, has average value 58 –
 1 Å, which is a little 
bit smaller than the value of 59.6 Å for giant multilamellar vesicles (Nagle and Tristram-Nagle 2000).

DMPC vesicles in the gel and ripple phases, the SF approximation of rrrr (x) 

Figure  6  shows  the  SANS  spectrum  from  500Å  extruded  vesicles  measured  at  T = 10oC  (gel 
phase  of  DMPC)  and  T = 30oC  (liquid  phase  of  DMPC).  Without  consideration  of  the  vesicles

polydispersity and the instrument resolution, the first minimum of Fs(q,d) corresponds to 

vesicle  radius  R = 275.6 Å  corresponds  to  the  qR = 0.011 Å-1.  Shift  of  the  qR   to  the  larger value of q 
reflects the decrease of average vesicle radius at temperature lowering as seen from Figure 6.  

The  consideration  of  SANS curves in the Guinier region of q from 0.03 Å-1 to 0.15 Å-1 shows 
the different exponents at T = 10  oC and T = 30  oC (equation 3). It is visually seen that at temperature 
decreasing  from  30oC  to  10oC  the  radius  of  gyration  of  the  bilayer  Rt  increases.  This  simple  analysis 
corresponds  to  the  dependence  of  the  membrane  thickness  parameter  dG  on  temperature  as  shown  in 
Figure 1.  

The number of water molecules in the bilayer depends on the lipid phase. For giant multilamellar 
DPPC vesicles, the number of water molecules in the region of polar head groups decrease from 8.6 in 
the  liquid  phase  to  3.7  in  the  gel  phase  (Nagle  and  Tristram-Nagle  2000).  SF  approximation  of  r (x) 
with  fixed  thickness  of  the  polar  head  region  dPH  is more appropriate for gel and ripple phases of the 
DMPC  bilayer  (Figure  3).  Value  of  r
 0.39(cid:215) 1010 (cid:0) m-2  was  used  as  fixed  parameter  in  the 
calculations for gel and ripple phases of DMPC.

Measured SANS curves at T = 10oC and T = 20oC for 500 Å and 1000 Å extruded vesicles were 
fitted based on the SF approximation of r (x). The deformation of spherical shape to elliptical was taken 
into  account.  Opposite  the  liquid  phase,  extruded  500  Å  vesicles  in  gel  and  ripple  phases  have 
pronounced elliptical form with eccentricity e = 1.6. 1000 Å extruded vesicles have e = 1.1 and can be 
considered as spherical taking into account problems in the determination of vesicle radius. The internal 
membrane structure did not show the dependence on the eccentricity and membrane curvature for both 
vesicle  populations.  The  results  of  fitting  and  calculation  are  given  in  Table 4  for  extruded  500  Å 
vesicles in gel (T = 10oC) and ripple (T = 20oC) phases. Results for extruded 1000 Å vesicles are given 
in  Table 5.  The  average  values  of  the  minor  semi-axis  a = 185  and  the  major  semi-axis  b = 300  at 
T = 10oC  change  to  the  a = 187  and  b = 303  at  T = 20oC  for  vesicles  prepared  by  extrusion  through 
pores with 500 Å diameter. These values are in the agreement with radius of pores. Similar to the liquid 
DMPC phase at 30oC, the average radius of 1000 Å extruded vesicles is underestimated relative to the 
radius of pores and DLS results. Polydispersity of vesicle population has smaller values in gel and ripple 
phase relative to ones in the liquid phase. For 500 Å extruded vesicles, the polydispersity increases from 
the  value  of  21%  in  gel  phase  to  the  value  of  26%  in  liquid  phase.  The  average  area  of  the  500 Å 
 is equal to 9.9·105 Å2 at T = 30oC. Average area of the vesicle decreases to 
extruded vesicles 
the values of 7.2·105 Å2 in ripple and 7.0·105 Å2 in gel phases. The decrease of vesicle area during the 
phase transitions from liquid to gel phase should increase the membrane thickness. Membrane thickness 
increases from 47.8 ± 0.2 Å at 30oC to 49.1 ± 0.7 Å at 10oC.

Unlike the liquid DMPC phase, the difference in the membrane curvature for 500 Å and 1000 Å 
extruded  vesicles  has  no  influence  on  the  membrane  thickness  and  hydration  in  gel and ripple phases. 
Values  of  the  membrane  thickness  d = 49.6±0.5 Å  and  the  surface  area  A = 49.2– 0.9 Å2  for  1000Å 
extruded  vesicles  are  little  bit  larger  than  values  d = 48.2 Å  and  A = 47 Å2  determined  for  giant 
multilamellar  DMPC  vesicles  in  gel  phase  (Tristram-Nagleet  al.  2002).  Giant  multilamellar  DMPC 
vesicles  can  be  considered  as  membrane  with  zero  curvature.  For  the  gel  phase,  numbers  of  water 
molecules in the region of polar head groups per DMPC molecule Nw, PH obtained for 500 Å and 1000 Å 
extruded vesicles are the same. Average value of Nw,PH = 5.6 –
 0.5 obtained in gel phase is smaller than 
hydration of liquid phase, Nw,PH = 7.4 –
 0.6. This difference in the hydration of gel and liquid phases is 
sufficiently smaller than the corresponding difference in the hydration of DPPC.  

Opposite to the liquid and gel phases of DMPC, information about internal membrane structure 
and hydration in ripple phase is hard to be evaluated through the X-ray diffraction experiment due to the 
limited number of the diffraction peaks. Parameters of the vesicle population and the bilayer structure of 
DMPC  vesicles  in  ripple  phase  are  given  in  Table 4  and  Table 5.  For  500Å  extruded  vesicles,  the

evaluated  vesicle  parameters  are  the  same  in  gel  and  ripple  phases  within  the  range  of  experimental 
errors. For 1000 Å extruded vesicles, the membrane thickness decreases from the value of 49.6±0.5 Å 
in  gel  phase  to  48.3±0.6  Å  in  ripple  phase.  Finally,  one  can  use  parameters  evaluated  for  1000  Å 
extruded  vesicles  d = 48.3  –
  0.8 Å  to  characterize  DMPC 
bilayer structure in ripple phase.

Let  one  consider  lipid  membrane  as  the  one  with  r c(x) ”

Guinier approximation for the flat membrane, connection with SFF model 
It is commonly believed that Guinier approximation describes the SANS curve at qﬁ 0. It is true 
 
for globular particles with one typical size (Guinier and Fournet 1955). Vesicles have two typical sizes: 
radius  and  membrane  thickness,  which  are  different  in  the  scale  of  one  -  two  orders  by  a  magnitude. 
SANS  curve  from  vesicles  have  two Guinier regions. First one is Guinier region of the vesicle size at 
qﬁ 0 and other one is Guinier region of the membrane. The sense and validity of the membrane Guinier 
approximation is clarified below. 
 D r  = const.  This  approximation 
 
conventionally  named  as  homogenous  approximation  (Feigin  and  Svergun  1987).  Really,  lipid 
membrane  is  non-homogenous  object,  r c(x) „
 const.  Homogenous  approximation  can  describe  only 
some part of the experimental scattering curve (Feigin and Svergun 1987). This part of the curve can be 
obtained  via  a  comparison  of  experimental  and  calculated  SANS  curves  (Kiselev  et  al.  2002). 
According  to  the  SFF  model,  the  scattering  amplitude  of  vesicle  for  r c(x) ”
 D r  = const  and  R>>dG  is 
written as (Kiselev et al. 2002)

Equation (26) is Guinier approximation of the form factor for the flat bilayer with infinitely large area S 
and membrane radius of gyration Rt. Form factor of the infinitely thin flat membrane has 1/q2 behavior. 
Form factor of the membrane with thickness parameter dG has exponential form and is characterized at 
qﬁ 0 by asymptotic properties of the function F(q)(cid:215)q2.  
Equation  (26)  was  evaluated  from  SFF  model  on  the  base  of  two  approximations:  D r  = const 
 
and  Rﬁ
.  This  equation  limits  a  possibility  to  receive  some  information  about  internal  membrane 
structure.  Internal  membrane  structure  is  a  case  of  D r „ const  and  requires  q  values  to  be  around  the 
region  of  Guinier.  It  can  explain  the  difference  between  the values of DMPC membrane thickness for 
500 Å  extruded  vesicles  at  T = 30oC  obtained  via  application  of  the  Guinier  approximation, 
d = 44.5– 0.3 Å and presented in Tables 3 d = 45.5– 0.7 Å (Kucerka et al. 2004).  
 
Dependence of the membrane thickness parameter dG on temperature as shown in Figure 1 can 
be corrected now for the values of membrane thickness calculated for 1000 Å extruded vesicles at 10oC, 
20oC,  and  30oC. Obtained values of parameter D dH are 5.4 Å, 4.9 Å, and 6.7 Å respectively for 10oC, 
20oC,  and  30oC.  Membrane  thickness  d  is  calculated  using  Equation  (5)  with  an  assumption  that  D dH 
has permanent values in gel, ripple, and liquid phases. Figure 7 shows the obtained dependence of the 
DMPC  membrane  thickness  on  temperature for 1000 Å extruded vesicles. Main future in temperature 
dependence  d(T)  is  a  sharp  increase  in  the  membrane  thickness  at  the  temperature  of  the  main  phase 
transition, T = 23oC. Obtained anomalous d(T) behavior supports the critical fluctuations of membrane 
thickness rather than fluctuations of water layer at the temperature of main phase transitions (Zhang et 
al. 1995, Lemmich et al. 1995). 

 
Conclusions 

Separated  Form  Factor  model  of  the  small  angle  scattering can be used for data interpretation 
for vesicles with radius larger than 250 Å. Shultz distribution well describes the vesicle shape and size 
for vesicles prepared via extrusion through pores of 500 Å. Average vesicle shape is near to spherical 
(eccentricity  1.1  )  for  liquid  phase  of  DMPC  and  deviates  sufficiently  from  sphere  in  gel  and  ripple 
phases  (eccentricity  1.6).  The  average  vesicle  radius  and the polydispersity can be evaluated correctly 
from SANS curve with minimum measured scattering vector qmin = 0.0033 Å-1 for vesicles with radius 
about  250 Å.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  SANS  experiment  with  qmin  <  0.0033  Å-1  is  necessary  for 
correct  evaluation  of  radius  ‡
  500 Å.  Approximation  of  the  neutron  scattering  length  density  across 
DMPC  bilayer  in  liquid  phase  as  hydrophobic  and  hydrophilic  regions  with  linear  water  distribution 
describes  the  internal  bilayer  structure  without  any  preliminary  structural  information.  Step  Function 
approximation  of  the  scattering  length  density  allows  evaluating  of  DMPC  membrane  thickness  and 
neutron scattering length density of the polar head group in gel, ripple and liquid phases based on the 
preliminary structural information about thickness of the polar head group. It was shown that thickness 
of  the  bilayer  depends  on  the  membrane  curvature.  The  DMPC  bilayer  thickness  of  the  curved 
unilamellar vesicles (49.6– 0.5 Å and 45.5– 0.6 Å in gel and liquid phases, respectively) is larger relative 
to that of multilamellar vesicles with nearly flat membrane (48.2 Å and 44.2 Å in gel and liquid phase, 
respectively).  Interpretation  of  the  SANS  data  is  based  on  the  calculation  of  the  scattering  length 
density across the membrane bilayer. Information about specific volume of the lipid molecule allows one 
to  receive  additional  structural  information  from SANS. In our study, a preliminary knowledge of the 
DMPC  molecular  volume  allows  one  to  calculate  bilayer  hydration  and  lipid  surface  area.  The  X-ray 
diffraction  has  been  successfully  applied  to  characterize  the  internal  membrane  structure  in  gel  and 
liquid  phase.  However,  the  diffraction  normally  does  not  give  accurate  information  about  membrane 
structure  in  ripple  phase.  This  drawback  of  diffraction  technique  can  be  overcome  by  SANS.  The 
internal  membrane  structure  and  hydration  of  ripple  DMPC  phase  were  evaluated  through  the  SANS 
experiment in present article. 

The results presented here emphasize the importance of appropriate models and approximations 
for  the  interpretation  of  SANS  data.  Usefulness  of  SANS  technique  for  the  characterization  of  the 
internal  bilayer  structure  and  hydration  was  shown  for  vesicular  systems.  Thus,  presented  herein 
methods can be used for the characterization of vesicular based drug delivery systems.

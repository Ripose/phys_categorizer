ABSTRACT

A  lattice  and  associated  superconducting  theory  is  postulated  whereby
electromagnetic and gravitational forces are mediated by a particle of mass (110.39
x  electron  mass)  such  that  the  established  electron/proton  mass  is  maintained,
electron and proton charge is maintained and the universe radius is 1.5E28 cm, the
universe  mass  is  2.0E56  gram,  the  universe  density  is  1.5E-29  g/cm3  and  the
universe time is 1.6E10 seconds.  The calculated universe mass and density are
based on an isotropic homogeneous media filling the vacuum of space analogous to
the 'ether' referred to in the 19th century and could be considered a candidate for
the  'dark  matter'  in  present  universe  theories.    Also,  a  YBa Cu O x
7−
superconductor should loos by .04% of its weight while in the superconducting
mode.  This  value  is  close  to  the  recently  reported  results  by  Podkletnov  and
Nieminen wherein a  YBa Cu O x
7−  superconductor shields the earth's gravitational
force  by  .05%  are  theoretically  confirmed  although  no  connection  between
superconductor  weight  reduction  and  gravitational  shielding  is  claimed.    Also
dimensional  guidelines  are  provided  for  design  of  room  temperature
superconductors and beyond.

INTRODUCTION

Trisine  structure  is  a  model  for  superconductivity  based  on  Gaussian  surfaces  surrounding
superconducting Cooper pairs.  This Gaussian surface has the same configuration as a  particular
matrix geometry as defined in reference [1], and essentially consists of mirror image non parallel
surface  pairs.    The  main  purpose  of  the  separator  lattice  is  to  control  the  flow  of  particles
suspended in a fluid stream and generally has been fabricated on a macroscopic scale.

The superconducting model presented herein is a logical translation of this geometry in terms of
classical and quantum theory to provide a basis for explaining aspects of the superconducting
phenomenon and integration of this phenomenon with gravitational forces within the context of
references[1-27].

This approach is an attempt to articulate a geometrical model for superconductivity in order to
anticipate dimensional regimes in which one could look for higher performance materials.  This
approach does not address specific particles such as polarons, exitons, magnons, plasmons which
may be necessary for the expression of superconductivity in a given material.

) which is representative of the energy at
Superconductivity is keyed to a critical temperature Tc
which the superconductive property takes place in a material.  The material that is characterized as a
superconductor has this property at all temperatures below the critical temperature.

(

In terms of the trisine model, any critical temperature can be inserted, but for the purposes of this
report, I will select  six critical temperatures as follows:

  -  1  -

1.1 Tc  

1.40E-15

o K

Tb  

2.7348    

o K

The  background  temperature  of  the  Universe  represented  by  the  black  body  cosmic
microwave radiation of 2.728  ±  .004  o K  as detected in all directions of space in 60 - 630
GHz frequency range by the FIRAS instrument in the Cobe satellite and 2.730  ±   .014  o K
as measured at 10.7 GHz from a balloon platform [26].  The particular temperature of
2.7348  o K  indicated above which is essentially equal the the black body cosmic radiation
temperature was established by the trisine model wherein the superconducting Cooper pair
density (see table 2.9.1) equals the density of the universe (see equation 2.11.4).

1.2 Tc  

93       

o K

Tb  

7.05E8

o K

 The critical temperature of the  YBa Cu O x
7−  superconductor as discovered by Paul Chu at
the University of Houston and which was the basis for the gravitational shielding effect of
.05% as observed by Podkletnov and Nieminen(see Table 2.9.1).

1.3 Tc  

447     

o K

Tb  

1.55E9

o K

The  critical  temperature  of  an  anticipated  room  temperature  superconductor  which  is
calculated to be 1.5 x 298 degree Kelvin such that the superconducting material may have
substantial superconducting properties at  an operating temperature of 298 degree Kelvin.

1.4 Tc  

1190    

o K

Tb  

2.52E9

The critical temperature of an anticipated material which would have the energy content of
gasoline(see Table 2.13.1).

1.5 Tc  

2,135   

o K

Tb  

3.23E9

The critical temperature of an anticipated superconducting material with the assumed density
(6.39 g/cm3)  [17] of  YBa Cu O x
7−  which would  generate its own gravity to the extent that
it would be weightless in earth's gravitational field (See Table 2.9.1).

o K

o K

1.6 Tc  

3,100,000

o K

Tb  

1.29E11

o K

The upper bounds of the superconductive phenomenon as dictated by relativistic effects
wherein material dielectric equals one (See Table 2.5.1).

) for maximum
As a general comment, a superconductor should be operated at about 2/3 of  Tc
effect of most properties which are usually expressed as when extrapolated to  T = 0 (see section
) in items 1.4 & 1.5 could be operated up to 2/3 of the
2.12).  In this light,  critical temperatures  Tc
indicated temperature (793 and 1300 degree Kelvin respectively) and still retain superconducting
properties characteristic of the indicated  Tc

TRISINE  MODEL  DEVELOPMENT

In this report, mathematical relationships which link trisine geometry and superconducting theory
are developed and then numerical values are presented in accordance with these relationships.
Centimeter, gram and second(cgs) as well as Kelvin temperature units are used unless otherwise
specified.

Experiments have been conducted to see if a rotating body's weight is changed from that of a non
rotating body [20, 21, 22]. The results of these experiments were negative as they clearly should
be because the center of rotation equaled the center mass.  A variety of gyroscopes turned at
various angurlar velocities were tested.  Typically a gyroscope with effective radius 1.5 cm was
turned at a maximum angular frequence of 22,000 rpm. This equates to a tangential velocity of
3,502 cm/sec.  At the surface of the earth, the tangential velocity is calculated to be  gRE   or
791,310 cm/sec.   The expected weight reduction if center of mass was different then center of

rotation r( ) according to equations 2.9.2 and 2.9.3 would be  3 502 791 310 2

gyroscope weight.  The experiments were done with gyroscopes with weights of about 142 grams.
This  would  indicate  a  required  balance  sensitivity  of  1.964E-5  x  142  g  or    2.8  mg  which
approaches the sensitivity of laboratory balances. Both positive20 and negative results [20, 21] are
experimentally observed in this area although it has been generally accepted that the positive results
were spurios.

Under the geometric scenerio for superconducting materials presented herein the Cooper pair
centers of mass and centers of rotation r( ) are different making the numerical results in table 2.9.1
valid.    Under  this  scenerio,  it  is  the  superconducting  material  that  looses  weight.    The
experimentally observed superconducting shielding effect can not be explained in these terms.

2 . 1 0 BCS  VERIFYING  CONSTANTS

Equations 2.9.1 - 2.9.8 represent constants as derived from BCS theory [2] and considered by
Little [4]to be primary constraints on any model depicting the superconducting phenomenon.  It
can be seen that the trisine model constants compare very favorably with BCS constants in brackets

Derivation of the universe energy dissipation rate assumes that all of the universe mass is in the
superconducting state.  In other words, our visible universe contributes an insignificant amount of
mass to the universe mass.  This assumption appears to be valid due to the subsequent calculation

of the Hubble constant HU

DISCUSSION

This effort is towards formulating of a theoretical frame work towards explaining the Podkletnov's
and Nieminen's results but in the process, relationships between electron/proton mass, charge and
gravitational forces were established which appear to be unified under this theory with links to the
cosmological constant, the dark matter of the universe, and the universe black body radiation as a
relic of its big bang origins.

The overall theory is akin to what Sir Arthur Eddington proposed during the early part of this
century.  He attempted to relate proton and electron mass to the number of particles in the universe
) which is
(
and the universe radius.  Central to his approach was the fine structure constant   
approximately equal to 137.  This relationship is also found as a consequence of our development
in equation 2.1.16, the difference being that a material dielectric ε( )  modified velocity of light vε(
)
) are determined for
is used.  To determine this dielectric ε( ) , displacement D(
Cooper pairs moving through the trisine lattice under conditions of the trisine lattice diamagnetism
equal  to  − 1 4π  (the  Meissner  effect).    Standard  principles  involving  Gaussian  surfaces  are
employed  and  in  terms  of  this  development  the  following  relationship  is  developed  based  on

(3.1)

At  this time, it is not known whether the trisine lattice is the only Gaussian surface which would
provide such results, but it may be so.

Also, it is important to note, that the trisine surface may or may not relate to any physical structure
in a superconducting material.  Although this is so, this theory may provide a basis for a "jump" in
 below 100 degree Kelvin to required anticipated materials with
thinking from material with  T sc'
T sc'

 on the order of 1000's of degrees Kelvin.

The present theory predicts the .05% weight loss of the 93 degree Kelvin superconducting material
in earth's gravitational field.  The presented theory is based on theory developed for predicting

  -  43  -

gravitional radiation from celestial objects.

In concert with the weight loss predeiction, it is also idicated that the superconducting material
itself will loose .05% of it weight.

The implications of such a verified effect are profound.  Conditions could be postulated as in table
2.9.1, such that a mass could be rendered weightless in earth's gravity.  Podkletnov and Nieminen
alluded to the basic mechanism developed in this report, in that a spinning mass develops its own
gravity as depicted in Figure 2.9.1 although it must be noted that the center of rotation must differ
from the center of mass (nonaxisymmetric spinning) as is the case with the superconducting theory
presented herein.  Also, it is noted that if somehow the Cooper pairs could be separated from the
material, the gravitational force shielding effect would be much more pronounced or in other words
the lower superconducting material density (approaching the Cooper pair density) the greater the
effect.

(

It  is  important  to  note  also  that  the  Cooper  pairs  are  postulated  to  travel  along  a  radius  of
) and not in a circle or in other words the Cooper pairs
curvature(B) with tangential velocity vdT
) is in three dimensions and
center of masses differs from their center of rotation.  This velocity vdT
the vector sum of x, y and z components.  This means that no matter what the orientation of the
superconducting material, there will be a tangential velocity vector facing the center of the earth as
indicated in Figure 2.9.1.  In other words, as the earth rotates, there will be a tangential component
in the superconductor circular to the earth's axis as defined by a line from the earth's center to the
center of rotation of the Cooper pairs with a constant gravitational force shielding effect.

(

Also, it is evident from the gravitation shielding principle graphically presented in figure 6, that it
does not matter what forces hold the rotating mass in orbit whether they be magnetic, electrical or
mechanical.  The orbit retaining mechanism postulated in this report is electrical and magnetic.

Also, without quantitative calculations, it is easy to postulate that a spinning superconducting disc
) of the superconductor and therefore provide an
(
would add to the inherent tangential velocity vdT
amplifying effect to the lessening of weight and to the experimentally observe shielding effect.

4 .

CONCLUSION

A lattice called trisine and associated superconducting theory is postulated whereby electromagnetic
and gravitational forces are mediated by a particle of mass(110.39 x electron mass) such that the
established electron/proton mass is maintained, electron and proton charge is maintained and the
universe radius as computed from Einstein's cosmological constant is 1.5E28 cm, the universe
mass  is  2.0E56  gram,  the  universe  density  is  1.5E-29  g/cm3 and the universe time is 1.6E10
seconds.

The  cosmological  constant  is  based  on  a  universe  surface  tension  directly  computed  from  a
superconducting energy over surface area.

The calculated universe mass and density are based on an isotropic homogeneous media filling the
vacuum of space analogous to the 'ether' referred to in the 19th century and could be considered a
candidate for the 'cold dark matter' in present universe theories.

  -  44  -

The 'cold dark matter' emmits a background radiation of 2.74  o K   as  has  been  observed  by  the
COBE satelite although its temperature in terms of superconducting critical temperature is an
extremenly cold 1.40E-15  o K .

Also, the recently reported results by Podkletnov and Nieminen wherein the weight of an object is
lessened by .05% are theoretically confirmed where the object is the superconductor,  although the
gravitational shielding phenomenum of  YBa Cu O x
7−  is yet to be explained.  In future experiments,
the weight of the superconducting object should be measured.  Also dimensional guidelines are
provided for design of room temperature superconductors and beyond.

The major conclusion of this report is that an interdisciplinary team effort is required to continue
this effort involving physicists, chemists, engineers.  Each has a major role in achieving the many
goals that are offered if more complete understanding of the superconducting phenomenon is
attained.

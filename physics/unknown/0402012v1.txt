Abstract

The alternative version of the Franck-Hertz experiment with mercury, in which a

two-grid tube is used as a combination of electron gun, equipotential collision

space,  and  detection  cell,  was  analyzed  recently  in  considerable  detail.  In

particular, it was inferred that, at optimal pressure, the formation of peaks in the

anode current at inelastic thresholds is mediated inside the detection cell by the

large variation, a maximum at 0.4 eV, in the cross section for elastic scattering.

This variation is due to a shape resonance in the electron-mercury system and

is  observable  persuasively  at  the  onset  of  anode  current  as  a  sharp  peak

followed  by  a  clear  minimum.  In  the  present  paper,  the  passage  of  electrons

through the second grid to anode region is analyzed in terms of kinetic theory.

The  discussion  is  based  on  a  simplified  expression  for  the  electron  current

derivable from an approximate form of the Boltzmann transport equation that

maintains  the  spatial  density  gradient  but  omits  elastic  energy  losses.  The

estimated  range  of  pressure  underlying  this  kind  of  idealization is  in  good

agreement with experiment. An explicit solution is obtained by constructing an

analytic expression for the momentum transfer cross section of mercury using a

recent  theory  of  generalized  Fano  profiles  for  overlapping  resonances.  This

solution  is  used  in  order  to  model  successfully  the  formation  of  peaks  at  the

threshold  of  anode  current  and  at  excitation  potentials,  and  to  explain  the

dependence  of  the  observed  profiles  on  the  pressure  and  on  the  sign  and

magnitude of the potential across the detection cell.

1. Introduction

The  standard  Franck-Hertz  experiment  and  the  alternative  arrangement

designed  to  show  more  than  one  excited  state,  are  extraordinarily  elegant

demonstrations of quantum mechanics that are deceptive in their simplicity.

In  the  latter  version,  electrons  are  accelerated  in  less  than  one

excitation  mean-free-path  to  a  final  potential  and  allowed  to  travel  across  a

field-free  region  between  two  grids.  A  recent  analysis  of  extensive  data

obtained in this experiment with mercury [1] revealed that in order to unravel the

results, (a) several complexities due to space charge must be understood and

(b) the effect of elastic collisions on electrons traversing the detection cell (the
region between g2 and A, in Figure 1), must be taken into account.

In the first place, the potential inside the drift cell between the two grids
(g1 and g2) is modified dynamically by the interaction of negative and positive
space charges. This complicates the interpretation of the observed excitation

spectra  because  some  peaks  can  be  due  to  the  same  feature  excited  in

different regions of the tube.

A determination of the space potential can be obtained from a careful

examination of the change in the spectra induced under controlled conditions. It
was  inferred  that  if  a  decelerating voltage (∆V)  is  applied  across  the  main
collision cell, this region is separated into two field-free, weakly ionized plasma

regions  at  different  potentials,  separated  by  a  narrow  space-charge  double

layer (see Fig. 1). Varying the intergrid potential can change the position of the

double layer. One can thus manage to create a field-free region of substantial

width  at  the  potential  of  the  exit  grid.  This  space  constitutes  the  useful

scattering chamber. A good quality spectrum is shown in Fig. 2.

The  second  major  point  is  that,  in  the  optimal  range  of  pressure,  the

motion of electrons at low electric field is governed primarily by diffusion. As a

result,  the  selection  of  electrons  that  have  undergone  inelastic  collisions  is

mediated inside the detection cell by a large variation (a maximum at about 0.4
eV) in the elastic cross section of electron-mercury scattering.

This aspect of the experiment is the main theme of the present paper.

Apart from its implicit appearance in the profiles of excitation peaks, the

variation in the elastic cross section is also observable directly: a peak is seen

close to the onset of anode current followed by a minimum (see feature 1 in Fig.

2).  The  demonstration  of  this  feature  in  its  own  right  can  be  planned  as  a

separate experiment suitable for a university laboratory. It should be feasible

with any Franck-Hertz tube and would serve to show that elastic scattering too

can be strongly energy-dependent as originally pointed out by R. Minkowski [2],

who originally discovered this phenomenon in mercury and cadmium with a two-

grid Franck-Hertz tube 80 years ago.

Better known variations at low energy are due to a different quantum
mechanical mechanism−the Ramsauer-Townsend effect−which is observed in
the  elastic  cross-sections  of  the  heavier  noble  gases  (Ar,  Kr,  Xe,  Rn).  This

phenomenon  should  be  particularly  easy  to  demonstrate  with  the  present

method, as outlined in Sec. 5.

2. Drift and diffusion without energy loss.

A theory of electron transport suitable to the present context is based on the
following continuity equation for the flux density Γ under a constant electric field

Γ =

where  x  is  the  space  coordinate  along  the  electric  field,  n(x)  is  the  electron

number  density,  m,  e,  the  electron  mass  and  charge,  E  the  electric  field
strength,  v(x)  the  electron  thermal  velocity  and  λ
M(x)  the  mean  free  path  for
momentum transfer. The first term in (1) represents the current carried by drift

and the second the current carried by diffusion.

This equation was given long ago by Hertz [3]. The main assumption is
that the mass M of neutral atoms is infinite and hence the electron energy ε is
conserved: ε (x)= ( 1 / 2 ) mv2 (x)= ε (x0) + e E × (x-x0) . Thus only the velocity vector v
is affected by collisions.

A  modern  study  by  McMahon  [4]  shows  that,  in  infinite parallel-plane
geometry,  equation  (1)  follows  easily  from  the  Boltzmann kinetic equation for

the electron distribution function f(x,v), using the common two-term expansion

f(x,v)=f0(x,v)+f1(x,v)cosθ,   with  v.E=- vEc os θ ,  and  letting  M→  ∞ b e f o r e
proceeding to the solution.

This  simplified  theory  should  be  applicable  between  two  electrodes  if
their  spacing  d  is  less  than  the  mean  free  path  for  energy  transfer  λε, where
λε=λ
M(M/2m)1/2.  Since  d  must  also  be  much  larger  than  λ
M for the Boltzmann
equation to hold, the requirements for validity can be stated as

λ

M

<< d < λε,  namely, for mercury: λ

<< d < 4 2 9 λ

The consistency of the bounds (2) with the experimental conditions delineated

in [1] will be verified later on. Considerations relating to electrode geometry are

not significant [4-5], and can be disregarded in a semi-quantitative picture.

Integration of Eq. (1) with appropriate boundary conditions leads to an
analytic expression for the ratio IA/IS of injected versus incident current between
two electrodes. The derivation is given in [4] and can also be found in [5]. For

Clearly, the grid picks up most of the incident current.

In order to apply the theory to the experiment described in [1] we need

an expression for the momentum transfer cross section of mercury.

3. An analytic expression of σσσσ

M (εεεε) for mercury.

The total cross section, σT(ε), and the momentum transfer cross section, σM(ε),
for elastic electron scattering from mercury (and several other elements) exhibit

a  large  peak  at  low  energy  that  is  attributed  to  an  unstable  state  (a  negative

ion). A recent review of this subject is given in [7].

The  asymmetric  nature  of  these  peaks  suggests  that  these  cross

sections  should  be  expressible  analytically  in  terms  of  the  well-known  Fano

lineshape  [8]  for  an  isolated  resonance  (the  lowest  unstable  state  of  the
negative ion) in a “flat” continuum (decay channel). But a careful comparison

with  experimental  profiles  shows  that  this  is  impossible.  Interference  effects

caused by broad higher-energy negative ion resonances imbedded in the same

continuum  significantly  modify  the  single-resonance  Fano  lineshape.  An

extensive analysis is given elsewhere [9].

Recently, a generalized expression of cross section profiles involving

interfering  resonances  was  developed  in  [10 -11].  This  lineshape  is  simply  a

product of Fano factors and of a Breit-Wigner term representing the portion of

the  continuum  (lumped  essentially  into  a  broad  “quasi-bound  state”,  a  wave

packet) that is strongly coupled to the resonances. For two resonances, the

generalized lineshape has the form

i  the resonance energies and Γi  their width, and the qi 
where ei = 2 (ε−εi)/ Γi , with ε
are  constants.  It  was  found  [9],  that  expressions  of  the  form  AF(ε)+B,  with
suitably adjusted constants A, B, provide analytic expressions for resonance-

dominated elastic cross sections of several elements, that are quite accurate in

a wide energy range. The constant B is viewed as a phenomenological quantity

representing  dynamics  involving  states  that  are  not  included  in  the  model
subspace spanned by the resonances, on which F(ε) is based.

Figure  3  shows  the  momentum  transfer  cross  section  of  mercury

derived  in  [12]  from  inversion  of  drift  velocity  data  in  a  swarm  experiment,  in
comparison to an analytic σM(ε) of the form AF(ε)+B. The latter was constructed
in [9] in terms of Eq. (8) with only one resonance factor, using the parameters

q1= 0.61, ε1= 0.145, Γ1= 0.39, ε2 = 0.34, Γ2 = 1.65, A= 442.5, B=91

(9)

where energies are given in eV and A, B in squared Bohr radii (a02).

The  maximum  of  our  analytic  cross  section  is  at  ε=0.42  eV  in
accordance  with  the  value  determined  in  an  accurate  beam  experiment  [13].

The idealized energy of the resonance, however, is much lower, as indicated by

some  theoretical  calculations  [7].  This  property  is  characteristic  of  single-
resonance  profiles  with  a  shape  parameter  q< 1  and  is  the  reason  for  the
quotation  marks  in  the  title  of  this  paper.  Only  for  q>>1  does  the  resonance
energy coincide with the maximum in the cross section.

In  an  energy  range  encompassing  the  peak  in  σ

M(ε),  the  interval  o f 
vapor  pressure  p   imposed by condition (2) using d=0.2 cm is between about
0.1 a n d   6   Torr  ( 80°< T < 170°) .   This  range  is  indeed  between  the  minimum
required  for  observing  feature  1  and  the  maximum  allowed  for  satisfactory

display of excitation peaks (see Sec. 8.1 in [1]). Below this interval there is no

diffusion; above this range the experimental results are degraded, presumably

because  energy  losses  due  to  elastic  collisions  become  significant  with

resultant breakdown of the simple Hertz-McMahon picture.

In order to model actual observations, we must include the effect of the
electron  energy  distribution.  In  the  usual  manner  [14],  we  let  IS(ε

represent the energy distribution of the current at detection-cell pressure zero

and  it  should  be  understood  that  in  this  case  the  threshold  (ε
current is displaced by F.

m=0)  of  anode

We first consider the mechanism of formation of feature 1 in Fig. 2.

The energy distribution of cathode electrons arriving at the second grid

at  various  pressures  is  difficult  to  evaluate.  The  abrupt  onset  of  the  anode

current suggests a short-tailed form. The results shown below were calculated
with  a  Gaussian  distribution  f(ε)=(π  Ω 2 )-1/ 2 exp[-ε2/Ω2 ]  with  Ω=0.2  eV.  Similar
profiles are obtained using a Maxwellian whose width is close to the estimated
temperature (Tc) of the cathode namely f(ε)=(2 Ω)-1exp[-(sgnε)× ε/Ω], with Ω=0.1
eV, (Tc ~1000° K).

Calculating IA(ε

m)  involves  a  simple  sequence  of  numerical  integrals,
because with the analytic cross section of Sec. 3 the integral inside the bracket

can be evaluated in closed form.

A  first  approximation  to  the  current  profile  near  threshold  can  be
obtained by using Eq. (10) with IS(ε
m)=1. We take p=4.2 Torr (T=160°) d= 0 . 2 ,
α = 1 ,   γ = 0 . 1 ;   this value of γ  for the type of tube employed in [1] was estimated
by McMahon in [5].

Figure 4 shows the results for a positive ∆a (F= 0.3 V), for the field-free
case F=0, and for retarding potentials of 0.2, 0.5 and 4 volts. It is seen explicitly
that  for  negative  values  of  ∆a  the  variation  in  the  current  is  smoothed  out:
Feature 1 is not observable under retarding potential conditions. This is why the

peak  near  the  onset  of  anode  current  does  not  appear  in  the  current-voltage

curves  of  the  earlier  authors  referenced  in  [1].  Minkowki,  however,  did  use  a
positive ∆a in his original demonstration of this structure [2].

The  next  step  is  to  model  the  current  at  different  pressures  (keeping
IS=1).  The  resulting  profiles  are  shown  in  the  dotted  curves  of  Fig.  5.  More
realistic  curves  are  obtainable  by  including  the  influence  of  a  rising  injected
current. The current IS can be written as IS= I0 ( ε
m) ;   I0  is the fraction of
cathode  current  injected  at  the  first  grid  with  energy  e|∆V| + ε
m,  and  IT  is  the
m,  after
fraction of I0  that reaches the vicinity of the second grid with energy ε
traversing  the  large  decelerating  region  between  the  grids.  The  factor  IT( ε
m) 
varies  slowly  with  ε
m,  but  I0   is  inevitably  space  charge  limited  and  is  thus  a
rapidly rising function which can considerably distort the observed profile. The

m) × IT( ε

effect  is  illustrated  in  the  full  curves  of  Fig.  5  computed  with  a  linearly  rising
source  current  IS(ε
m .  These  profiles  are  quite  similar  to  those

m)=0.4+ ε

commonly observed without particular precautions in any tube.

In an interval of large accelerating potential (Vg1 in Fig. 1), the rate of
rise  of  I0(ε
m)  is  smaller  and  hence  the  distortion  of  the  anode  current  in  the
vicinity  of  the  resonance  can  be  reduced  by  increasing  |∆V|.  This  effect  is
evident in the series of profiles of feature 1 displayed in [1].

Basically similar considerations apply to the formation of peaks due to

excitations incurred in the lower-potential drift space of Fig. 1 (as shown in [1],

those are the peaks beyond feature 1 labeled by numbers in Fig. 2). Since that
collision-cell is at g2 potential, a source of slow electrons will be formed at the
m=ε*.  It  is
entrance  of  the  g2-anode  region  at  every  inelastic  threshold  ε
presumed that only an insignificant number of inelastic events take place inside

the detection-cell, an assumption that is supported by visual observations, as

described elsewhere [15].

It  follows  that  the  previous  equations  are  applicable  for  modelling

qualitatively  the  formation  of  excitation  peaks  with  the  understanding  that
energies are measured with respect to ε*.

Note  that  beyond  the  first  inelastic  threshold  the  cathode  current  has

reached saturation, and so the distortion due to a rising source current does not
m)dε will now depend on the particular
take place. On the other hand, IS(ε
form  of  the  inelastic  cross  section,  on  the  pressure,  and  on  the  length  of  the

m)f(ε-ε

effective  collision  chamber.  A  detailed  analysis  of  the  shape  and  strength  of

individual excitation peaks is beyond the scope of the present paper.

The influence on excitation peaks of the sign of ∆a is not easy to verify
experimentally. Small changes of this potential in either direction affect primarily

the background current (a smoothly varying combination of fast electrons and

positive  ions)  so  that  the  whole  excitation  curve  is  shifted  inconveniently
upwards or downwards. All one can say is that ∆a=0 was found to be the best
setting, except for some cases where a small positive value of 0.1 - 0.3 V was

necessary  in  order  to  obtain  a  well-balanced  curve  throughout  the  energy

range.

5. Employing the method for showing the Ramsauer effect

The  clarification  of  Minkowski’s  experiment  obtained  here  in  terms  of  kinetic

theory  suggests  that  this  type  of  apparatus  would  be  particularly  effective  for

demonstrating the Ramsauer-Townsend effect in the noble gases. A large peak

in the anode current should be observed at low energy that coincides with the

deep minimum in the elastic cross section.

The anticipated result can be modelled with the tools presented here.

An analytic momentum transfer cross section typical of the heavier noble gases,

with  a  minimum  at  1  eV  and  a  maximum  close  to  10  eV,  can  be  constructed

using the generalized Fano formula (8) of Sec. 3 with a fictitious resonance of

negative shape index q.

The values of the parameters are

q1= − 0.9, ε1= 0.1, Γ1= 2, ε2 = 8, Γ2 = 15, A= 200, B=1

(12)

and the cross section is shown in Fig. 6.

Assuming  that  the  gas  is  xenon  [(M/2m)1/2 = 358],  the  large-pressure

limit implied by condition (2) of Sec. 2 is now about p=11 Torr at T=25° (N=10).

Figure 7 shows the anode current obtained at this pressure from Eq. (10), for
F=0 and with the previous tube parameters. The dashed curve is for IS(ε
m)=1
and the solid curve shows a more realistic form, resulting from a linearly rising
source current I0(ε

m)=0.4+ ε

m.

A  demonstration  of  the  Ramsauer  effect  in  xenon  has  been  in  the

literature for some time [16]. But that experiment, carried out in a commercial

2D21 xenon thyratron at about 0.05 Torr, relies on a beam type technique (no

diffusion): the anode current is simply a measure of the unscattered portion of

the  beam.  Significant  discrimination  between  the  scattered  and  unscattered

components occurs because in that tube the size of the exit aperture towards
the collector is limited. Hence IA(ε)/IS(ε)~exp[-AσT (ε)] where σT  is the total cross
section and A=Nx, x being the length of the collision cell. For a sufficiently large

value of A, this form of current too exhibits a large maximum at the minimum of
σT (ε).  So to some extent the profile of IA(ε) obtained in [16], is similar to that of
Fig. 7 although the latter results from IA(ε)/IS(ε)~1/σM (ε).

Contrasting  the  beam-type  demonstration  with  the  observation  of  the

same phenomenon in the diffusion current in a Franck-Hertz tube (namely in

open collector geometry) would be an instructive introduction to the relationship

of fundamental atomic processes to the macroscopically observable transport

properties of a gas. The design and construction of a suitable tube should be

straightforward.

6. Conclusion

The  main  lesson  conveyed  in  this  paper  is  that  the  remarkable  results  of  the

extended Franck-Hertz experiment can only be appreciated in terms of kinetic

theory. The description in terms of simple beam attenuation commonly found in

textbooks is not pertinent because it is inconsistent with the range of pressure

required for producing acceptable results. For a beam picture to be operative

the gas temperature must be below 80°. Structure is in fact descernible below

this temperature (as mentioned in Sec. 8.1 of [1]) but its definition is far from

satisfactory. An amended arrangement incorporating a sophisticated detection

mechanism must be used in the low-pressure regime, as described in the work

of Martin and Quinn [17]. And at any rate, in the lack of significant diffusion the

observation of the 0.4 eV resonance is impossible because no discrimination

between the scattered and unscattered portions of an elastically colliding beam

is provided for.

Similar  remarks  apply  to  the  textbook  explanation  of  the standard
Franck-Hertz  experiment.  That  a  truer  picture  highlighting  electron  transport

effects  is  long  overdue,  is  easily  seen  simply  by  verifying  that  the  retarding
potential  between  g2  and  anode− a  mandatory  accessory  in  the  beam
interpretation− is beside the point, as pointed out by McMahon [5].

Actually  the  standard  version  is  even  more  difficult  to  elucidate.  The

pressure recommended in this case with the tube of [1] (T=200°-220°, namely

p=17-32 Torr) exceeds the range of the Hertz-McMahon regime for mercury so

that the full weight of modern kinetic theory must likely be brought to bear. Work

in this direction was reported recently by Robson et al [18-19], and Sigeneger et

al  [20].  Still,  their  approach  is  only  a  preliminary  step  because  (a)  the  role

played by the detection cell between grid and anode is not explained and (b)

the recurrent variations of potential observed in striated discharges [21] (of the

type  underlying  the  standard  Franck-Hertz  experiment  [22])  are  disregarded.

The mechanisms leading to field-variations in striated discharges are currently

being  investigated  by  Goluboskii  et  al.  A  glance  at  [23]  is  helpful  for

appreciating the complexity of the problem.

Fig. 1.  Interelectrode  space-potential  between  cathode  (K)  and  anode  (A)
showing two field-free plasma regions joined by a space-charge sheath.

The  high - potential  plasma  is  initially  (solid  curve)  at  applied value  of
grid 1 voltage (Vg1), but is raised dynamically (dashed curve) by δ volts
in the course of the experiment (see [1] for details). For sufficiently large
intergrid potential ∆V + δ,  the high potential region shrinks so that only
the spectrum excited at g2 potential is observed.

Fig. 2.  Anode  current  plot  with  ∆V = − 4.1  V showing  a  pure  low-potential
excitation spectrum plus feature 1 (structures labelled by numbers). The
early  (lettered)  peaks  are  excited  at  Vg1  potential  (the  low-potential
plasma has not been created as yet).

Fig. 3.  The analytic expression of σM(ε) for mercury obtained from Eqs (8) and
(9) (solid curve) compared to the momentum transfer cross section of

England and Elford [12] (dashed curve).

Fig. 4.  Anode current profiles calculated with IS=1, at p=4.2 Torr (T=160°), for
grid  to  anode  potentials  ∆a = +0.3  V  (upper  curve)  followed  in
descending order by ∆a = 0 ,   − 0 . 2 ,   − 0 . 5 ,   − 4 .   For  large  negative ∆a 
(dashed  curve)  the  rise  is  almost  linear.  For  easier  comparison,  the
thresholds of the ∆a < 0  curves have been shifted leftward to zero.

Fig. 5.  Profiles  (with  ∆a = 0)  of  the  anode  current  at  T=80°,  120°,  160°,
corresponding  to  vapor  pressures  p  of  0.09,  0.75,  4.2  Torr,  in
descending  order.  Dashed  curves  are  for  IS=1,  solid  curves  for
IS=0.4+ε

m.

Fig. 6.  Approximate  analytic  momentum  transfer  cross  section  for  a  heavy

noble gas, constructed from Eqs. (8) and (12).

Fig. 7.  Predicted  Franck-Hertz  current  profiles  demonstrating  the  Ramsauer-

Townsend effect, calculated using the cross section of Fig. 6, at p=11
Torr, T=25°, ∆a = 0, with the Gaussian energy distribution and the tube
parameters  of  Sec.  4.  Dashed  curve  is  for  IS=1,  solid  curve  for
IS=0.4+ε

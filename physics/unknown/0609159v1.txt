The study is devoted to the development of new effective tools and methods of ana-

lytical hydrodynamics, including problems of existence, smoothness and structure of laminar 
and turbulent flows. The main problem – complex Navier-Stokes equations and turbulence in 
complex spaces. The necessity of introducing complex spaces in hydrodynamics is deter-
mined by the mechanism of transition of a laminar flow into a turbulent flow. The author pro-
poses a non-traditional scenario of the transition: the cause of turbulence is in destruction 
(cessation of existence) of a laminar flow. The article contains the mathematical rationale for 
the necessity of development of the theory of turbulence in the complex configurational space: 
the complex configurational space is the natural area of existence of turbulence. Hydrody-
namic flows are regarded as flows on entropy manifolds that [flows] are supported by the two 
symmetries: the symmetry of conservation of general entropy and the symmetry of duality of 
impulse representation. The new symmetry has been introduced and studied: the forminvari-
ance of Helmholtz matrix of impulse density. The strict foundation has been provided for the 
known fact of chaotic mechanics: appearance of the new structure (a turbulent flow) is a result 
of interaction of two entities – dissipation and vorticity.  

On the deep level the phenomenology of turbulence in complex spaces is based on the 

transition from the mechanics of a material point to the mechanics of an oriented material 
point, that [transition] takes place in a current period of time. 

 
 
 

 

I. The problem of complex spaces in hydrodynamics has attracted attention of re-

searchers due to appearance of the entropy conceptual model, methodology and tools of de-
scription of the Nature and surrounding Reality. This problem is intimately connected with 
analytical hydrodynamics and theory of turbulence.  

Analytical hydrodynamics and its important section - the theory of Navier-Stokes 

equations - are attracting attention of many researchers nowadays. In the theory of Navier-
Stokes equations, starting from the work by Leray [1], the majority of researches have been 
devoted to the problem of "weak" (turbulent) solutions (see works [2-6]). Despite the multi-
tude of such researches, our knowledge of the structure and properties of the solutions of Na-
vier-Stokes equations remains rather limited. Therefore, the task of brining new ideas, con-
cepts and methodologies into analytical hydrodynamics has become actual.  

The new concept, methodology and tools for studying continuous media have been 

developed by A.N. Panchenkov in the book series "Entropy" [7–10]. 

The one of characteristic features of this series is the following: in the majority of the 

problems the basic geometrical objects (phase spaces, configurational spaces, entropy mani-
folds etc. ) are complex. And what is more, the subject of the book "Inertia" - the theory of 
inertia - was realized above the field of complex numbers. The entropy mechanics is defined

by A.N. Panchenkov in the book "Entropy mechanics" as the mechanics of flows on entropy 
manifolds of complex configurational spaces and fields in complex configurational spaces.  
The factor determining advisability and necessity of the complexification is the exis-

tence of rotor in the virtual continuous medium. Let me remind that Navier-Stokes equations 
were introduced into hydrodynamics for describing laminar flows of a viscous incompressible 
fluid; the question of validity and dependability of their application is still open. The applica-
bility of real Navier-Stokes equations for describing turbulent flows was questioned by sev-
eral investigators (see, e.g. [3]). Yet this question has become especially actual lately, due to 
activation of researches on theory of these equations [4], [6], [ http://claymath.org]. The par-
ticular facts and materials determining necessity of transition to the complex Navier-Stokes 
equations in the problem of turbulence are contained in the book [8]. The author set forth the 
non-classical hypothesis of turbulence origin in the chapter "Turbulence" of the book "En-
tropy-2: Chaotic Mechanics." The origin of turbulence is believed, usually, to be related to the 
loss of stability of a laminar motion. I accepted the another hypothesis, that is not connected 
whatsoever with the loss of stability of a laminar motion. A laminar motion can not exist for-
ever; sooner or later, it ceases to exist. A time-point of cessation of existence (destruction) of 
a laminar flow is, simultaneously, the point of appearance of a turbulent flow.  

According to this hypothesis, the cause of turbulence is a destruction of a laminar 

flow. A destruction of a laminar flow (as of a certain structure) is not directly related to stabil-
ity of a motion; it is not a loss of stability that is implied, but destruction of one structure 
(laminar flow) followed by appearance of another structure (turbulent flow). Both destruction 
and appearance take place in chaos, that fact determines the key role of the chaotic mechan-
ics.  

The development of the effective theory of turbulence, based on the hypothesis of de-

struction of a laminar flow, requires, naturally, introducing the complex basic geometrical 
objects and the complex Navier-Stokes equations; such introduction has been performed by 
me in the book [8]. It has been established there, that, regarding the problem of turbulence, 
the complex phase space is the natural environment for the turbulence.  

II. The basic postulate of the entropy analysis of hydrodynamics is formulated as fol-
lows: the conceptual model of hydrodynamics is the concretization of the entropy conceptual 
model [11].  

The basic geometrical object of the entropy theory is the phase space - the smooth 

manifold with local coordinates p and q: 

 

W = { q , p | W = Wq · Wp; Wq (cid:204) R3; Wp(cid:204) R3; W (cid:204) R3 ¯ R3}. 
 

Here: 
q – the generalized coordinate. 
p – the impulse. 
R3– three-dimensional real Euclidean space. 
R3 –  conjugate three-dimensional real Euclidean space 
The phase space forms: 
1. The configurational space 
 

2. The impulse space 
 

Wq = {q | Wq (cid:204) R3}. 
 

Wp = { p | Wp(cid:204) R3}. 
 

The general entropy has the dual representation:  

 

2 

H f  =  Hq  + Hp ; {q , p} ˛ W,  (1) 

Hq –  structural entropy, 
Hp – impulse entropy. 
The global symmetry is supported on the states of medium, located in the phase space: 
 

H f  = const. (2) 

This symmetry follows from the principle of the entropy maximum applied to the 

Boltzmann concept of entropy [7] 

 

 

H f ≜–

ln
d
rr W

, {q , p} ˛ W.  (3) 

(cid:242)

W

 

This initial representation of entropy contains  r  - density of the virtual continuous 

medium. 

The first reduction of the phase space – the smooth manifold called the entropy mani-

fold - is organized by means of the symmetry (2) 

Э =  {q , p | Э (cid:204) W , Hf}. 
 
The entropy manifold has the structure of the direct product: 
 

Э =  Эq · Эp : Эq =  {q | Эq (cid:204) Э , Hq}; Эp = { p | Эp (cid:204) Э , Hp}. 

  
Here: 
Эq – the entropy manifold of the configurational space, 
Эp – the entropy manifold of the impulse space. 
 
The solenoidal manifold is obtained via setting the divergence on the entropy manifold

The introduction of the potential of accelerations in the theory leads to the next reduc-

tion of the entropy manifold - the manifold of the potential of accelerations

The reduction of the manifold of the potential of accelerations, that [reduction] con-

tains impulse potential, is an important concept in our theory. 

The submanifold of the manifold of the potential of accelerations, that [submanifold] 

contains the impulse potential, is called Hilbert field. 
Hilbert field has the following representation: 
 

Г = {q , p| Г  (cid:204) П ; Y}.

III. The second symmetry – duality of representation of impulse – plays the funda-

mental role in the theory, that was set forth in the article [11]: 

(10) 
 

(11) 

The first component of this dualism defines the free impulse, and the second compo-
nent - the attached impulse. The attached impulse is realized in the case of the existence of a 
diffeomorphism:  

Ts :   Wq ﬁ Wp. p(q , t) ˛ C∞(
 

T

qW ) ; 

T

qW = Wq · (0,T). 

In the equation (12) Т is the time of destruction of a laminar flow. 
Let us introduce one more symmetry, in addition to the two aforementioned symmetries.  

Here exists also the symmetry of duality of representation of the generalized coordinate: 
 

The first component of this dualism corresponds to the Eulerian description, and the 

second one – to the Lagrangian description.

The consequence of the symmetry (12) is the one more fundamental symmetry: duality

IV. The following data on the phenomenology of hydrodynamics are needed for fur-

ther discourse:  

1. The two entities exist in the continuous medium of viscous incompressible fluid: 

1).  Hydrodynamic fields. 
2).  Hydrodynamic flows. 

2. Hydrodynamic flows are located on the entropy manifolds. 
3. There are two types of hydrodynamic fields: 

4. There are two kinds of hydrodynamic flows: 

3).  Vorticity fields. 
4).  Potential fields. 

5).  Laminar flows. 
6).  Turbulent flows. 

5. Turbulence is a kind of chaos. 
6. Laminar flows are more smooth (regular) and they are realized on the real geomet-
rical objects – entropy manifolds. 
Taking into account the Helmholtz expansion theorem [13] and the work [11], let us 

accept the following representation of a laminar flow on the entropy manifold: 

q& ≜ u ; u ≜ p + w ; div u = 0 ;q ˛ Эq ; t = [0,T] 
w = w (q,t) ; q ˛ Эq ; w ≜ rot B ; B ˛ C∞(
qW ).

The key role in a laminar flow (15) belongs to the hypothesis of independence, intro-

duced by the authors of the work [11]: vorticity does not depend on the impulse 

w = w (q,t) ; {q, p,t} ˛ WT ; WT = W · (0,T).  
 

V. Having in mind the book [8], let me introduce Helmholtz matrix into the discourse:

lowing:  
 

Let me introduce now the basic hypothesis: a laminar flow (17) may be represented 

normally on the real entropy manifold: 

 

q& ≜Lq ; q˛ Эq ; t ˛[0,T]. (17) 
 

q& ≜ L% q; q˛ Эq ; t ˛[0,T].  (18) 
L% = Re L%  ;
 

L% = diag { 12

l,l, l

3

}. 

 

Whence the characterization of a laminar flow follows: the diagonal matrix  L%  is im-

posed above the field of real numbers.  

 

Let me remind, that the matrix  L%  has dual representation 
 

(q,t), q Э .

L = (cid:237)

(t).

 (19) 

 

In turn, matrices {c, m,  W% } have also dual representation, resembling (19). 
In other terms for a laminar flow, the generalized coordinate - vector-function q = q (t) 

on the segment [0, Т] - is imposed above the field of real numbers.  

VI. The accepted scenario of transition of a laminar flow into a turbulent flow is fol-

lowing: the cause of appearance of a turbulent flow is cessation of existence (destruction) of a 
laminar flow. At the time-point T one structure (a laminar flow) undergoes destruction, at the 
subsequent time-points, that are close to T, the new structure (a turbulent flow) arises.  

In the chaotic mechanics the entropy manifold, on which an event (destruction or ap-
pearance of a structure) takes place, is called extremal boundary layer (EBL). The theory of 
EBL is given in the book [8].  

sJ. 
The fundamental property of EBL is its small length along the scale of real time 
Therefore, in order to keep definiteness, I shall study the event of transition of a laminar flow 
. Let me note, that 
into a turbulent flow on the small segment []:(Tt)[
an event and accompanying chaos in EBL have adequate description in terms of the known 
theory of ultimate correctness [14]. In fact, EBL is the manifold of the local ultimate incor-
rectness.

Definition 1. If t  is current time and  T –  time-point of destruction of a laminar flow, 
then laminar flow is a smooth vector-function  {q=q (t ¢), t¢=T–t} on the segment  [e‚T] –  the 
generalized coordinate determined above the field of real numbers.  

Definition 2. If t is current time and  T  is time-point of destruction of a laminar flow 

and Т1 is character time  (Т1 > Т), then turbulent flow is a vector-function  {q = (t'), t' =  Т– t} 
on the segment  [– e  ‚  (Т –  Т1)] -  the generalized coordinate determined above the field of 
complex numbers.  

Definition 3.  The transition of a laminar flow into a turbulent flow is the transforma-

tion of the smooth real vector-function  {q=q(t'); q=Req; t'=T–t}  on the segment   [e‚T]  (the 
generalized coordinate) - into the complex vector-function {q = q(t'): Im q „ 0} on the segment  
[–e ‚(T–Т1)] at Т1>T.

A transition of a laminar flow into a turbulent flow exists if there exists the non-
smooth vector-function on the segment  [ - e ‚ e ]; t'˛  [ - e ‚ e ]; t' =  Т– t that has the

This duality is more convenient in some cases, as it reduces the problem of turbulence 

appearance to the problem of eigenvalues. The equation of a flow in EBL has the dual repre-
sentation:

As is known, the diagonal matrix  L%  in this equation is the matrix of eigenvalues of the 

Helmholtz matrix. We come here to the known fact [8]: 

1.  L%   = Ln - laminar flow 
2.  L%  = Ln  + i Lw  - turbulent flow.  
VII. The structure of a flow in EBL is established on the basis of analysis of elemen-

tary functions. Some elementary functions do not exist for negative values of argument above 
the field of real numbers. There are two character functions among them:  

 

7 

t¢  - the first character function; 
1.  t = 
2.  ln t' – the second character function.  
The character functions for negative values of argument are represented as follows: 
1. t = i
2. ln t' =  pi  + ln |t'|; t' < 0. 
Being functions on the segment [

‚ ε ] , the character functions are non-smooth 

|t |¢ ;     t' < 0.

Let me now endow the matrix of impulse density with the symmetry – forminvariance. 
The forminvariance of the matrix of impulse density means that that the matrix-function L has 
the same outlook (structure) for both components of time duality:

The proof. In the case of Helmholtz matrix of impulse density 

L = c + m +   W% , 

possessing the forminvariance regarding the time  t , the same symmetry is intrinsic to 

the equation of a flow 

q& = Lq ; q ˛ Эq. (33) 

 
In turn, the equation of velocity flow is: 
 

q&& = ( L& + L2) q ; q ˛ Эq . (34) 

 
It is evident, that this equation possesses the forminvariance regarding the time 

t. As

, in the case of the forminvariance of the matrix of impulse density 

the equation (36) possesses the symmetry of the structure. 

Let us accept now the following characterization of flows:  
1. A laminar flow 
 

    

Tt;(Tt) 0
>

t=-"-
 Эq = {q| Эq (cid:204) Wq; Wq (cid:204) R3}. (37) 

; 

 
2. A turbulent flow: 
 

t=-"-

i|Tt|;(Tt) 0
<

Эq = {q| Эq (cid:204) Wq; Wq (cid:204) ℂ
 

 ; 
3}. (38) 

Here: R3– three-dimensional Euclidean space; 
          ℂ
Introducing these characterizations into the equation (36) and adding the equations of 
continuity and flow (33), we come to the equations of laminar and turbulent flows of the theo-
rem. ■ 

3 – complex three-dimensional real Euclidean space.

Now, in accordance with the book [7], we get the equation of structural entropy from 

the equation (39):

Here Нq - structural entropy, st = st(t) - divergent invariant.  
The equation (40) forms the manifold:  
 

Vq = {q|  Vq (cid:204)  Эq; Пq = ft; Пq  = q1(cid:215) q2(cid:215) q3} .        (41)

Discussion. The fundamental result of the Lemma 1, that [lemma] is associated with 
the separation theorem from the article [11], is of great importance for the theory of Navier-
Stokes equations and turbulence. Its semantics is following: in the local zone of destruction 
(EBL) a laminar flow contains potential and vorticity components; an appearance of the new 
structure – a turbulent flow – is a result of an interaction of the two entities – dissipation and 
vorticity.  

IX. For the normal flow in EBL (21) the equations of hydrodynamics may be written 

as follows:

The first case was studied in details in the book [8]; I am commencing here the study 

of the second case. In this case, the following approximate equations are held: 

L&% q = – qrad П  + nD L% q + f; q ˛ -
 

qЭ .  

The characteristic solution, that satisfies the inequation 2., is the following one:

 (51) 

 
The generalized coordinate, that is determined by the above solution, is defined by the 

form:

Let me note an interesting detail: the solution (52) satisfies the initial data, set at t = T. 

It is the sequitur from the symmetry of EBL – the local invariance. The bounces, arising at 
traversing the core of EBL, have the following values: 

 

                1. [q] = 0.              2.

So, the studied example shows that in a case of change of a flow structure the general-

ized coordinate remains continuous, whereas its derivative has a bounce .  

The dualism, describing laminar and turbulent branches of a flow, follows from the 

equation (52):

Please, note that the solution (47) is more general: it describes the representative set of 

attractors of a laminar flow, that [attractors] generate different kinds of turbulent flows.  

In conclusion, let me cite the following sentence: on the deep level the phenomenology 

of turbulence in complex spaces is based on the transition from the mechanics of a material 
point to the mechanics of an oriented material point, that [transition] takes place in a current 
period of time [10].

1. Introduction 
 

A system for the automated detection of massive lesions in mammograms is presented. 
The  approach  we  adopted  is  a  pixel-based  and  multi-level  one  [1,  2].  Each  pixel  in  a 
mammogram is flagged with the appropriate class membership, e.g. massive lesions or 
normal breast tissue. 
 
2. Methods 
 

The  pixel-based  detection  scheme  we  propose  is  referred  as  Pixel-Matrix  Theory 
(PMT). It is based on the following main steps: a) a vector of features extracted from the 
matrix of the grey-level values of a pixel and its neighbourhood (minimum size 3x3) is 
assigned  to  each  pixel  of  the  mammogram;  b)  the  vector  of  features  is  analysed  by  a 
neural classifier, which assigns to the pixel a measure of suspiciousness; c) the pixels are 
grouped  in  connected  regions  and  a  method  for  reducing  the  amount  of  false-positive 
findings  is  implemented.  Within  the  PMT  framework  the  features  characterizing  the 
pixel are the singular values of the intensity matrix, the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors 
of the gradient  matrix, the  eigenvalues  of the  Hessian  matrix. A  multi-level analysis is 
performed: the mammogram is analyzed at several resolution scales and the features are 
extracted from matrices of different sizes.  
 
3. Results and Conclusion 
 

A set of 70 mammograms (45 containing massive lesions and 35 constituted only by 
normal  tissue)  were  used  for  a  preliminary  test  of  the  method.  The  best  performances 
achieved  in  classifying  the  pixels  are  87.9%  for  the  sensitivity  and  88.0%  for  the 
specificity. An algorithm for reducing the false positive findings generated by the system 
is currently being tested. The preliminary results are satisfactory and an enhancement of 
the performances is expected.

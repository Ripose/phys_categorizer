Abstract—We  studied  the  effects  of  bulk  and  surface
conductivity  on  the  performance  of  high-resistivity  CdZnTe
(CZT)  pixel  detectors  with  Pt  contacts.  We  emphasize  the
difference in mechanisms of the bulk and surface conductivity
as  indicated  by  their  different  temperature  behaviors.  In
addition, the existence of a thin (10-100 A) oxide layer on the
surface of CZT, formed during the fabrication process, affects
both  bulk  and  surface  leakage  currents.  We  demonstrate  that
the  measured  I-V  dependencies  of  bulk  current  can  be
explained  by  considering  the  CZT  detector  as  a  metal-
semiconductor-metal  system  with  two  back-to-back  Schottky-
barrier contacts. The high surface leakage current is apparently
due  to  the  presence  of  a  low-resistivity  surface  layer  that  has
characteristics  which  differ  considerably  from  those  of  the
bulk material.

This  surface  layer  has  a  profound  effect  on  the  charge
collection efficiency in detectors with multi-contact geometry;
some  fraction  of  the  electric  field  lines  originated  on  the
cathode intersects the surface areas between the pixel contacts
where  the  charge  produced  by  an  ionizing  particle  gets
trapped.  To  overcome  this  effect  we  place  a  grid  of  thin
electrodes  between  the  pixel  contacts;  when  the  grid  is
negatively biased, the strong electric field in the gaps between
the pixels forces the electrons landing on the surface to move
toward  the  contacts,  preventing  the  charge  loss.  We  have
investigated these effects by using CZT pixel detectors indium
bump bonded to a custom-built VLSI readout chip.

I.  INTRODUCTION

Hard  X-ray  focusing 

telescopes  have  been  recently
proposed  for  balloon-borne  payloads  (HEFT  [1]  and  InFocus
[2]),  and  the  Constellation  X-ray  space  mission.  A  position
sensitive  CdZnTe  (CZT)  detecting  system 
is  currently
considered to be the best choice as the focal plane detector for
these  telescopes.  We  are  developing  a  system  which  consists
of  an  array  of  CZT  pixel  detectors  indium  bump-bonded  to
custom VLSI readout chips. In previous papers [3,4] we have
discussed the details of the design and performance of earlier
CZT/VLSI  hybrids,  which  have  proved  that  excellent  energy
resolution (670 eV FWHM at 59.5 keV and –10 C) is possible
for such detectors.

We  found  that  bulk  and  surface  conductivity,  which
determines  the  total  pixel  leakage  current,  can  also  affect  the
charge  transport  in  CZT  detectors.  For  example,  in  pixel
detectors with conventional contact geometry; some fraction of
the  electric  field  lines  originated  on  the  cathode  above  pixel
boundaries terminates at the anode within the gaps between the

pixel  contacts  where  the  signal  charge  gets  trapped  [5-7].  To
overcome this effect we place thin steering electrodes (a grid)
between  the  pixel  contacts  [8,9].  When  the  grid  is  negatively
biased  the  strong  electric  field  inside  the  gaps  between  the
pixels forces the electrons on  the  surface  to  move  toward  the
contacts, significantly reducing the charge loss.

The main drawback of using the  steering  electrodes,  as  in
the case of coplanar grid detectors, is an extra leakage current
component that significantly increases the total leakage current
per pixel. Moreover, as we found, the surface leakage current
strongly  depends  on  the  cathode  bias,  and  the  total  leakage
current  turns  out  to  be  more  than  the  sum  of  two  separately
measured bulk and surface components.

In  this  paper  we  report  on  these  effects  studied  using  our
CZT  pixel  detectors  coupled  to  custom  VLSI  chips.  The
ability  of  the  readout  system  to  simultaneously  read  signals
from  multiple  pixel  events  was  a  key  advantage  in  these
studies.

II.  EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

The CZT detectors used in these studies were grown with the
high-pressure Bridgman technique and patterned according to
our  specifications  at  eV-Products,  Inc.  Each  detector  had  a
pixel array with a grid of steering strips on the anode side (see
Fig. 1), and a monolithic contact as the  cathode.  Geometrical
parameters  of  the  detectors  and  pixel  patterns  are  listed  in
Table  1.  Pt  contacts  were  sputtered  on  the  polished  and
chemically  treated  surface  of  CZT  slabs  and,  as  a  final  step,
surface  areas  between  contacts  were  passivated  based  on  eV-
Products,  Inc.  technology.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  the
passivation was achieved by  oxidation  of  the  top  layer  of  the
CZT surface (we will discuss this in more detail later). In the
course  of  the  project  we  accumulated  a  great  deal  of  data  by
characterizing  detectors  fabricated  over  a  three-year  period
from different CZT ingots.

I-V characteristics of leakage currents were measured using
a  probe  stage  with  a  Keithley  237  SourceMeter  and  an  EDC
521  voltage  source.  The  detector  was  placed  on  a  massive
copper  chuck  attached  to  a  cooling  system,  and  the  whole
probe  stage  was  enclosed  inside  a  metal  light-tight  box.  We
took  the  majority  of  the  data  at  room  temperature;  we  also
measured  the  temperature  dependency  of  leakage  currents  at
several  specific  biases  by  varying  slowly 
the  chuck
temperature.  Dry  nitrogen  gas  was  used  to  purge  the  box  to
avoid  moisture  condensation  at 
temperatures.  The
temperature  during  the  measurements  was  monitored  with  a

We took special precautions to ensure a steady state current
condition during the measurements. Because of the presence of
deep levels in the forbidden gap of CZT  material,  it  can  take
several  minutes  or  even  hours  to  reach  equilibrium  between
free  and  trapped  carriers.  To  reduce  the  waiting  interval
between  measurements,  we  varied  the  bias  on  the  contacts  in
small  steps.  To  be  more  specific,  after  setting  a  new  set  of
contact biases, we paused for 5-10 minutes before taking 100
sequential  measurements  of  the  current,  separated  in  time  by
10-20-sec intervals. This sequence of data points allows us to
verify  that  equilibrium  has  been  actually  achieved,  and  also
increases  the  accuracy  of  the  measurements.  We  found  that
illumination of the  CZT  slab  with  infrared  (IR)  light  helps  to
reach  equilibrium  faster,  especially  in  the  case  of  surface
current  measurements.  For  this  purpose  (and  some  others
which  will  be  discussed  later)  we  install  a  conventional  IR
light-emitting diode (with a spectral maximum at ~900 nm) in
close proximity to the CZT sample.

We typically took the measurements from -100 V to +100
V,  but  in  some  cases  we  increased  the  maximum  applied
voltage up to 1 kV. We eliminate the leakage current flowing
over  the  side  surfaces  of  the  detector  by  using  a  guard  ring.

can be found in Ref. [10].

II.  RESULTS OF THE LEAKAGE CURRENT
MEASUREMENTS

In 

We  measured  the  bulk  and  surface  leakage  currents  for
individual  pixels. 
the  bulk  current
the  case  of 
measurements,  for  each  cathode  bias  the  current  flowing
through  the  pixel  was  measured.  The  grid  was  kept  under
ground potential to ensure that the whole anode surface of the
detector was at the same ground potential as the pixel contact
(at a virtual ground); i.e. the electric field is uniform along the
anode.

In  the  case  of  the  surface  current  measurements,  the  grid
voltage  was  varied  in  steps,  while  the  cathode  was  kept  at
constant potential set with an additional power supply.

It  should  be  mentioned,  that  although  the  detectors  have
different  geometrical  parameters,  we  found  that  results  were
very  consistent  after  scaling  the  applied  voltages  to  the  same
width  of  the  gap  (in  the  case  of  the  surface  current
measurements) or to the same thickness of CZT (in the case of
bulk current measurements).

Figs. 2 and 3 show two selected sets of I-V measurements
whose  shapes  can  be  attributed  to  diode-like  and  ohmic-like
behaviors;  the  majority  of  the  measured  I-V  curves  lie  in-
between  those  two.  At  first  glance,  these  two  curves  look
different;  nevertheless,  they  can  both  be  explained  based  on
the  same  model  which  considers  a  CZT  detector  as  a  metal-
semiconductor-metal  (MSM)  system  with  two  back-to-back
Schottky  barriers  (see  e.g.  Sze  et  al.  [11]  and  Cisneros  et  al.
[12]).  In  order  to  obtain  good  quantitative  agreement  with
experimental  data,  two  additional  CZT  features  hove  to  be
included  in  the  model:  series  resistance  of  the  bulk,  and  the
effect  of  the  interfacial  layer  between  the  metal  contact  and
semiconductor  [10].  The  latter  effect  can  be  described  based
on a so-called combined interfacial layer-thermionic-diffusion
(ITD)  model  developed  by  Wu  [13].  All  the  computational
details  can  be  found  in  Ref.  [10];  here  we  present  the  final
results  of  the  analysis  with  a  general  explanation  of  the
physical process involved.

The results of the fitting procedure are also shown in Fig. 2
and 3. At small applied biases the current follows Ohm’s law
simply because the resistance of the Schottky contact is much
less  than  the  series  resistance  of  the  undepleted  bulk.  The
voltage  drop  across  the  Schottky  barrier  is  small,  and  adjusts
itself  to  accommodate  the  current  limited  by  the  bulk
resistance.  Above  ~1  V  the  voltage  drop  across  the  barrier
rises  and  current  flowing  over  the  barrier  approaches  the
saturation  limit;  from  this  point  on,  bulk  resistance  has  little
effect  on  the  current,  and  the  width  of  the  depletion  layer  is
adjusted  in  accordance  to  the  current.  Above  the  reach-
through  voltage,  VRT,  i.e.  the  voltage  at  which  the  detector
becomes fully depleted, the dark current is controlled solely by
the  properties  of  the  contact.  The  specific  shape  of  the  I-V
curve  below  VRT  can  be  calculated  numerically  if  the
parameters  of  the  contact  barrier  are  known.  One  can  also
solve an inverse problem–fit experimental data to estimate the

unknown  parameters  used  in  the  model.  By  doing  so,  we
found,  for  example,  that  the  height  of  the  potential  barrier  of
the Pt-CZT system lies between 0.77 and 0.79 eV for all tested
detectors.  Above  VRT  an  analytical  expression  can  be  used  to
fit the measured curves (again, see Ref. [10] for details). The
role  of  the  interfacial  layer,  whose  origin  will  be  discussed
later, is twofold. First, it affects the carrier concentration near
the  cathode  (we  assume  n-type  CZT)  since  the  electrons
entering  the  semiconductor  from  the  metal  should  tunnel
through  the  insulating  layer.  In  ITD  theory,  this  is  described
with the transmission coefficient θ, which gives the fraction of
electrons  passing  through  the  layer.  Second,  the  voltage  drop
across  the  interfacial  layer  results  in  barrier  height  lowering
which  in  turn  leads  to  an  exponential  rise  of  the  saturation
current at high biases, above VRT (this is clearly seen on all I-V
curves above 200 V). Even though the barrier lowering effect
can be neglected, the saturation current can still increase with
the applied voltage depending on the conditions occurring near
the cathode. If the electrons at the cathode are in  equilibrium
with  the  metal  (competition  between  electrons  crossing  the
interfacial  layer  into  CZT  and  electrons  being  removed  from
the  interface  by  the  electric  field  toward  the  anode),  then  the
free  carrier  concentration  at  the  cathode  remains  independent
of the applied voltage up to the very high biases. In this case
the  saturation  current  is  simply  proportional  to  the  electron
concentration and electric field-strength at the cathode; in the
Schottky-depletion 
is
proportional  to  the  square  root  of  the  applied  voltage  below
VRT and directly proportional to the voltage above VRT. This is
called  the  diffusion-limited  approximation  of  the  Schottky
barrier. The other limiting case is when the electrons entering
the  CZT  are  immediately  removed  from  the  contact  area.  In
this case the current will be determined by the flux of electrons
thermionically  emitted  over  the  potential  barrier  from  the
metal into the CZT. This current, called thermionic emission-
limited current, depends only on the height of the barrier, and
is independent of the applied voltage. In reality, we observed
intermediate cases where the ITD theory will be a more proper
approach. The effects described above are clearly seen on the
measured  I-V  curves.  As  an  example,  the  I-V  curve  in  Fig.  2
exhibits a very strong effect of the interfacial layer. Since the
transmission  coefficient  is  much  less  than  1,  the  saturation
current is  close  to  the  thermionic-limited  case.  The  I-V  curve
starts bending around 1 V, and the density of the dark current
is two orders of magnitude less than the thermionic emission-
limited current that would be expected based on the potential
barrier  height  of  ~0.78  eV.  However,  above  100  V  it  starts
rising  exponentially  because  of  the  potential  barrier  lowering
effect. If the latter effect could be neglected we would expect
to see I-V characteristic following the curve “T” in Fig. 2 (the
thermionic  emission-limited  current).  Moreover,  if  we  could
also  neglect  electron  reflection  from  the  interfacial  layer,  i.e.
set θ=1, we would expect the current to follow the curve “D”
(diffusion-limited  current).  As  shown  in  Fig.  2,  the  measured
current  is  closer  to  the  thermionic-limited  case.  The  curve
evaluated  based  on  the  ITD  theory  is  also  plotted  along  with
estimates  for  the  model  parameters.  This  curve  provides  an
excellent  fit  to  the  experimental  data.  The  fact  that  the
measured current is close to the thermionic-limited case (if one
neglects  the  barrier  lowering  effect)  is  directly  related  to  the

3

poor  electron  transmission  across  the  interfacial  layer,  i.e.
θ<<1.

The  curves  in  Fig.  3  represent  another  limiting  case  in
which  the  effect  of  the  interfacial  layer  is  small.  The  fitting
procedure gives similar values for the model parameters as in
the  previous  case,  except  for  the  transmission  coefficient  θ,
which is now close to 100%. As a result, the measured current
follows the diffusion-limited curve “D” up to very high biases,
and  the  exponential  rise  due  to  barrier  lowering  is  less
pronounced.  As  mentioned  previously,  the  diffusion-limited
current  increases  linearly  with  voltage  above  VRT.  This
behavior  resembles  Ohm’s  law,  but  with  a  much  smaller
effective resistivity which is inversely proportional to the  free
electron  concentration  at 
the  diffusion
approximation  (see  for  instance  Ref.  [12]),  the  electron
concentration at the cathode is less than in the bulk by a factor
exp(-Vbi/kT),  where  Vbi  is  the  built-in  voltage,  and  kT  is  the
thermal  energy  at  temperature  T.  Our  fitting  algorithm  gives
0.03-0.05 eV for  Vbi, then the reduction  factor  is  ~0.1.  In  the
bias range from 10 to 200 V, it is very easy to misinterpret the
I-V curve as following Ohm’s law. As a result, an overestimate
of the bulk resistivity will be obtained (the dotted line in Fig. 3
is  the  extrapolation  of  the  diffusion-limited  current  to  zero
bias).

the  cathode.  In 

Based  on  the  above  discussion,  we  can  conclude  that  the
diode-like behavior of the Pt-CZT system is masked by other
effects. It  manifests  itself  in  the  fact  that  the  actual  measured
leakage current is significantly smaller than it would be, based
on  Ohm’s  law,  and  only  a  vigorous  analysis  as  described  in
Ref.  [10]  can  reveal  the  parameters  of  the  Schottky  barrier.
This  is  especially  true  for  the  curve  in  Fig.  3  which,  in  fact,
represents more commonly observed I-V characteristics. Here,
slight  changes  of  the  slope  can  be  barely  seen.  However,
several  simple  experiments  can  uncover 
the  diode-like
behavior of the Pt–CZT interface.

One  of  them  is  to  use  IR  light  to  illuminate  the  detector
during  the  measurements;  this  effectively  reduces  the  bulk
resistivity of the material. The I-V curve shown on the top of
Fig.  3  was  measured  under  this  condition  for  the  same
detector.  The  sharp  bending  around  0.1  V,  which  is  an
indication  of  the  diode-like  behavior,  is  clearly  seen  (for
comparison the ideal I-V curve of a diode is also plotted).

Another  experiment  is  to  measure  the  current  flowing
between the contacts having different areas. When the grid was
left  floating  we  observed  a  strong  asymmetry  in  the  currents
measured for two different polarities of the cathode bias. At a
negative bias we measured a much higher current because the
electrons were injected from the whole cathode (whose area is
much  larger  than  that  of  a  pixel  contact)  and  collected  by  a
single  pixel.  When  the  bias  was  reversed,  the  electrons  were
injected  from  the  small  area  pixel  contact–as  a  result  we
measured  a  smaller  current.  This  experiment  proves  that  the
CZT detectors used in these measurements were n-type.

Based  on  the  above  discussion  we  can  conclude  that  in
most cases, the bulk leakage current is controlled by the height
of  the  Schottky  barrier  at  the  contacts  (0.77-0.79  eV).  In  the
first  approximation,  the  shape  of  the  I-V  curve  resembles
Ohm’s  law  but  with  much  smaller  effective  resistivity  than  in
the  bulk.  However,  if  the  interfacial  oxide  layer  exists  at  the

contacts,  it  changes  the  shape  of  the  I-V  curve  toward  the
thermionic emission case. This can be used to characterize the
quality of the contacts on CZT.

B.  Surface leakage current

the 

Although 

importance  of  surface  effects  on 

the
performance  of  CZT  detectors  has  been  commonly  accepted,
the  information  about  the  properties  of  the  CZT  surface,  and
the  origin  of  the  high  surface  conductivity,  in  particular,  is
very limited.

The  surface  leakage  current  is  apparently  due  to  the
presence of a low-resistivity surface layer which has different,
in  comparison  with  the  bulk  material,  chemical  and  band
structure.  As  is  well  know  in  semiconductor  science,  non-
stoichiometric  material  is  typically  formed  on  the  surface  of
semiconductors  after  the  dicing  and  polishing  steps.  In  many
cases this non-stoichimetric layer can be removed by chemical
etching; however, in the case of CZT, it appears that bromine
etching leaves a Te-enriched layer on the CZT surface [14-17].
There are no direct measurements of the electronic properties
of  the  Te  layer  on  the  CZT  surface,  but  some  interesting
results  were  obtained  for  CdTe  material.  Montgomery  [18]
demonstrated that a  thick  layer  of  amorphous  tellurium  could
be chemically produced on the surface of CdTe, and that this
layer indeed had a very low  resistivity  because  of  the  narrow
band gap of Te, ~0.33 eV.

Our  results,  which  we  present  below,  support  this  general
idea [14-17] that the Te layer is formed during the fabrication
process, which later becomes partially or completely oxidized
after the passivation step, or as a result of natural oxidation in
air.  The  later  process  starts  as  soon  as  the  surface  of  CZT  is
exposed  to  air  or  to  the  oxygen  outgasing  in  the  sputtering
chamber.  If  for  any  reason  the  surface  of  CZT  was  not

protected  from  oxygen  prior  to  making  the  contacts,  the
insulating  layer,  whose  effects  on  the  bulk  leakage  current
were  discussed  above,  will  appear  between  the  contact  and
CZT surface.

Despite  the  surface  oxidation,  there  always  remains  a
stoichiometrically  imperfect  interfacial  layer  between  the
native oxide (Te oxide) and the bulk material. We believe that
the  properties  of  this  layer,  which  can  be  considered  as  an
example  of  the  so-called  insulator-semiconductor  interface
(see for instance Ref. [19]) determine the surface conductance
of CZT detectors. The main feature of the interfacial layer is a
very  high  concentration  of  states  (associated  with  different
kinds  of  defects,  impurities,  Te  clusters,  etc)  located  in  the
forbidden gap of CZT, which can form a band structure. If the
band gap in the interfacial layer is small, the charges from the
semiconductor can easily occupy conduction or valence bands,
and make possible a direct-current conduction.

Fig. 4 shows two I-V curves measured for the detector D2
at two  temperatures:  26  C  and  –10  C.  As  seen  in  both  cases,
the  current  changes  first  as  a  linear  function  of  the  voltage,
applied across the gap between the grid and the contact, up to
a certain transition voltage, above which it starts rising rapidly
as  a  power  law  function,  I~Vα,  with  α>2.  More  accurate
measurements  reveal,  however,  that  the  dependence  is  linear
only within close proximity of zero bias. At higher biases, but
below the transition voltage, it rises just a little slower than a
linear  function.  This  fact,  together  with  the  asymmetrical  I-V
curves  observed  for  the  pixels  with  small  contacts  and  wide
gaps,  i.e.  when  the  perimeter  of  the  grid  is  much  larger  than
the perimeter of the contact, suggests that the conducting layer
on the CZT surface acts as the MSM system described above.
The  transition  voltage  (or  voltage  of  crossover  from  Ohm’s
law  to  power  law)  is  related  to  a  breakdown  condition  at  the
contact, but the current does not rise sharply because the space
charge accumulated in the gap limits current injection from the
contact. Moreover, the space-charge-current regime predicts a
power  law  dependence  with  α>2  for  semiconductors  with  an
exponential distribution of traps in the forbidden gap (see e.g.
Lampert and Mark [20]).

The  existence  of  the  space-charge-limited  regime  is  an
indication that surface conductance takes place inside the thin
the  accumulation  or
interface 
inversion  layers  that  generally  can  exist  in  the  bulk  near  the
surface.  The  different  electronic  properties  of  the  bulk  and
surface layer can be illustrated by the temperature dependence
of  the  surface  and  bulk  currents.  Fig.  5  shows  the  relative
changes  in  the  bulk  and  surface  currents  measured  for  the
detector  D2.  The  curve  (1)  represents  the  surface  current
measured at 1 V bias on the grid and zero bias on the cathode,
whereas the curve (2) represents the bulk current measured at
1  V  on  the  cathode  and  zero  bias  on  the  grid.  (The  elected
voltages  correspond  to  the  linear  regions  of  the  bulk  and
surface I-V characteristics.)

We  found,  that  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  bulk
leakage  current,  measured  at  –1  V,  can  be  accurately  fitted
with a single activation energy function with Ea=0.84 eV. It is
tempting to attribute this energy to a deep donor level at 0.743
eV  above  the  valence  band  which  is,  according  to  Ref.  [21],
responsible  for  compensation  in  CZT  crystals  grown  by  the

high-pressure  Bridgman  method.  In  the  case  of  the  surface
leakage current, a similar fit with the single activation energy
function gave Ea=0.65 eV.

We estimated the surface resistivity by fitting the measured
I-V  curves  in  the  low-voltage  region.  Normally,  we  accepted
from  the  vendor  only  high  surface  resistivity  detectors,  with
resistivity >500 GOhm/square. Several treatments can increase
the  surface  resistivity  even  more.  All  these  treatments  can  be
explained by the surface oxidation, which reduces the number
of  the  interface  states  and  consequently  the  free  carrier
concentration inside the interfacial layer. Those are: 1) natural
surface  oxidation  over  a  long  period  of  time  when  detectors
are kept in air; 2) temperature stimulated oxidation (baking the
detectors  in  air);  and  3)  electric  field  stimulated  oxidation
(keeping  the  detectors  biased).  Usually  the  surface  resistivity
increases  2-5  times,  depending  on  its  initial  value,  and
stabilizes  around  2000-3000  GOhm/square.  The  highest
surface  resistivity  we  measured  was  ~4500  GOhm/square  at
room temperature.

The  shape  of  the  I-V  characteristic  of  the  surface  current
helps  to  characterize  the  quality  of  the  surface  passivation;
however,  they  cannot  be  used  to  estimate  the  total  pixel
leakage  current  because  the  cathode  bias  significantly  affects
the surface conductance.

C.  The field-effect

The  field-effect  is  used  in  many  semiconductor  devices,
e.g.  a  field-effect  transistor,  where  the  width  of  the  space-
charge  layer  near  the  surface  is  controlled  by  the  external
electric  field  created  with  the  metal  gate  contact  separated
from  the  semiconductor  by  a  thin  insulating  layer.  We
attempted  to  observe  a  similar  effect  in  CZT  detectors  by
placing  a  thin  one-sided  aluminized  mylar  foil  on  top  of  the

5

contact  pattern  of  the  detector.  We  did  not  observe  any
changes in the surface leakage current (even when the applied
voltage  exceeded  100  V).  This  implies  that  the  surface
conductance  of  CZT  is  not  due  to  accumulation  or  inversion
layers.

It  is  possible  that  there  could  be  a  different  type  of  field-
effect in the CZT detectors as described below. Assuming that
surface  leakage  current  is  flowing  inside  the  insulator-
semiconductor  interface,  one  can  expect  that  its  conductance
can be controlled by changing the carrier concentration inside
the interface (i.e. by changing the occupancy of the conduction
or  valence  bands).  To  check  this  hypothesis,  we  tried  to
observe  the  changes  in  surface  leakage  current  caused  by
applying  voltage  on  the  cathode.  Fig.  6  shows  the  I-V
characteristics  of  the  surface  current  measured  at  different
biases  on  the  cathode.  Before  plotting  the  I-V  curves,  we
subtracted  the  bulk  current  components  by  fitting  the  I-V
curves in the low bias region. As is seen in Fig. 6, the surface
current changed significantly when voltage was applied on the
cathode.  This  means  that  the  total  pixel  leakage  current  does
not equal the sum of the bulk and surface currents if they were
measured  separately.  We  tested  a  large  number  of  detectors
and  found  that  when  a  negative  voltage  was  applied  on  the
cathode,  the  actual  total  pixel  leakage  current  was  always
significantly larger than that calculated by adding the bulk and
surface components. In contrast, when the cathode is positively
biased  the  actual  measured  current  was  smaller.  This  is  a
disappointing  result,  since  the  negative  bias  on  the  cathode
(the  one  imployed  for  normal  operation  of  a  pixel  detector)
increases the surface leakage current. To illustrate this, Fig. 7
shows  the  bias  dependence  of  the  surface  conductance,
evaluated  from  plots  similar  to  those  shown  in  Fig.  6.  We
systematically  tested  all  our  detectors  (~20)  and  found  one
unique  detector  for  which  the  polarity  of  the  field-effect  was
“reversed”  (i.e.  the  surface  leakage  current  was  significantly
smaller  when  negative  bias  was  applied  on  the  cathode).  We
are  currently  investigating  this  effect,  which  is  of  great
importance  for  multi-electrode  CZT  detectors,  in  cooperation
with eV-Products, Inc.

Comparing the plots in Figs. 4 and 6, one can easily see the
similarities in the way the surface I-V curves evolve when the
temperature decreases, and when a positive voltage is applied
on the cathode. In both cases the ohmic region extends toward
the  higher  grid  biases,  while  the  non-ohmic  part  of  the  curve
rises with a steeper slope. Similar changes were observed after
baking  the  samples  or  keeping  the  samples  in  air  for  a  long
time (i.e. after further oxidation of the CZT surface). All these
effects  can  be  explained  as  a  result  of  the  reduction  of  free
carriers in the insulator-semiconductor interface. The electrons
excited in the conduction bands of the interface states remain
in  equilibrium  with  the  carriers  in  the  bulk;  as  a  result,  the
occupancy of the conduction bands of the interface varies with
the  carrier  concentration  in  the  bulk  near  the  surface.  If  the
latter  is  reduced  (because  of  the  cathode  voltage  or  low
temperature),  the  former  should  also  decrease  as  shown  in
Figs. 4 and 6.

Fig. 6. I-V characteristics of the surface current measured at three different biases on the cathode at room temperature. The triangles and squares represent
current measured at negative and positive biases on the grid respectively. The solid lines are the fitting results at low biases with a linear function. The bulk
current components are subtracted to adjust the curves to zero current at zero bias.

The  performance  of  the  CZT  pixel  detector  is  directly
related  to  the  dark  current  and  surface  conductivity  of  the
detector.  The  total  leakage  current  determines  the  electronic
noise. Moreover, since the signals from the pixels are read out
with  a  VLSI  chip  bonded  directly  to  the  detector,  it  is
desirable,  from  a  designer’s  point  of  view,  that  the  leakage
current remains low. This means that the pixel area should be
small or the operating temperature low.

Because  of  the  surface  conductance,  the  field  lines  in  the
detector  can  intersect  the  surface  between  the  contacts  where
the  charge  gets  trapped.  As  has  been  already  discussed,  to
avoid this problem we have the steering grid negatively biased
with  respect  to  the  pixel  contacts.  This  adds  the  surface
component to the total leakage current which, however, can be
reduced by proper treatment of the surface.

A.  Total leakage current per pixel

Because  of  the  field-effect  the  total  leakage  current  per
pixel should be measured by applying bias simultaneously on
the cathode and the grid. The results are given here for the D3
detector,  whose  geometrical  parameters:  a  400x400  µm  pitch
size,  a  50  µm  gap,  and  a  15  µm  grid  are  very  close  to  the
optimal.  For  a  –5  V  bias  on  the  grid  and  –300  V  on  the
cathode (the typical operating biases), the total leakage current
was measured to be ~150 pA per pixel at 26 C; it drops below
20  pA  at  0  C  and  below  3  pA  at  –10  C.  These  are  typical
currents  measured  for  all  but  one  detector,  which  has  a
different  polarity  of  the  field-effect  (see  a  previous  section).
Fig. 8 shows how the total current measured for this detector at

–6 V on the grid changes with the cathode bias. At 26 C and –
300 V on the cathode, it drops below 7 pA, a value limited by
the  bulk  leakage  current  only.  This  unique  detector  is  an
example  of  a  truly  room  temperature  detector  which,  as  we
hope, eV-Products, Inc. will be able to reproduce in the future.

As  was  explained  earlier,  at  high  grid  biases  the  surface
leakage  current  can  reach  the  space-charge-controlled  regime
and become very large. However, statistical fluctuation of the
space-charge-limited 
in
semiconductor  device  physics)  remains  small.  This  may
explain why the electronic noise of the coplanar CZT detectors
was  found  to  be  significantly  less  than  the  noise  estimates
based on the nominal value of the leakage current [22].

B.  Charge collection efficiency

In the absence of surface conductivity all the electric field
lines  are  expected  to  originate  and  terminate  on  the  metal
contacts only. This is because the CZT is slightly conducting,
and  charges  built  up  on  the  surface  in  the  areas  between  the
contacts repel field lines toward the contacts. In this ideal case,
field  lines  should  never  intersect  non-metalazed  surfaces.
However, if the surface is conductive the built-up charge leaks
away and field lines can intersect the surface areas between the
contacts. This effect exists in any multi-electrode CZT detector
and  should  be  taken  into  account  when  designing  a  contact
pattern.

Another  important  feature  related  to  charge  collection
efficiency  is  the  non-uniformity  of  the  electric  field  over  the
the
detector 

thickness,  which  comes  about  because  of

uniform distribution of space charge, the electric field strength
decreases linearly toward the anode (for a n-type material). In
reality, because of the deep levels, the field seems to decrease
more rapidly, especially at low temperatures.

IV.  CONCLUSION

These  studies  demonstrate  the  importance  of  the  dark
current and surface conductance for CZT pixel detector. Both
bulk  and  surface  leakage  currents  contribute  to  the  total
leakage  current  per  pixel,  which  determines  the  electronic
noise,  and  limits  energy  resolution  of  the  detector.  They  also
control 
the  detector  and,
inside 
the  field  distribution 
consequently, charge collection efficiency.

We found that the bulk leakage current is controlled by the
height  of  the  Schottky  barrier,  which  is  about  0.77-0.79  eV.
The  shape  of 
the  I-V  curve  resembles  an  ohmic-like
dependence  but  with  an  order  of  magnitude  less  effective
resistivity than in the bulk. The interfacial oxide  layer,  which
is  inevitably  formed  between  the  contact  and  CZT  surface,
affects the shape of the I-V characteristic, and this can be used
to characterize the quality of the contacts.

To  avoid  the  charge  loss  at  the  surface  between  the  pixel
contacts,  we  employ  a  very  thin  grid  between  the  contacts  to
steer electrons landing on the surface toward the contacts. It is
very important that the width of the grid and the gap between
the grid and the contact be small (we suggest a 15 um grid and
a 50 um gap). In this case the required grid bias will be below
the  region  where  the  surface  space-charge-controlled  current
regime  takes  place.  Because  of  the  field-effect  the  total
leakage  current  per  pixel  becomes  a  complex  function  of  the
applied  biases.  The  actual  current  can  be  significantly  higher

Fig.  8.  Total  leakage  current  per  pixel  measured  for  the  “unique”
detector (see text) at –6 V on the grid and negative biases on the cathode. The
surface leakage current measured at –200 V on he cathode is three times less
than that at zero bias.

or  significantly  lower  than  the  sum  of  the  bulk  and  surface
currents measured separately, depending on surface properties.
Needless  to  say,  this  effect  (similar  to  the  field-effect  in
semiconductor  devices)  should  also  play  an  important  role  in
coplanar grid and other multi-electrode CZT detectors.

Abstract  

In  this  Letter  we  report  observations  of  optically  induced  self-organization  of  colloidal 

arrays  in  the  presence  of  un-patterned  counter-propagating  evanescent  waves.  The 

colloidal  arrays  formed  along  the  laser  propagation-axis  are  shown  to  be  linked  to  the 

break-up of the incident field into optical spatial solitons, the lateral spacing of the arrays 

being related to modulation instability of the soft condensed matter system.

Optical  spatial  solitons  (OSS)  are  spatially  localized,  non-diffracting  modes  that  are 

supported in nonlinear optical media. They are the result of a balance between diffraction 

and  self-phase  modulation  which  results  in  self-focusing  under  intense  illumination[1]. 

OSS  have  a  number  of  distinct  physical  properties  that  differ  from  normal  propagating 

modes  in  that  they  have  a  single,  solitary  beam-like  profile  and  interact  with  other 

solitons in a particle like manner [2].  For a plane-wave incident field, small wavefront 

perturbations cause the optical field to break-up into periodic arrays of OSS [3,4] or more 

complex patterns [5], an effect known as modulational instability (MI) [6-8]. Both OSS 

and  MI  are  generic  properties  of  wave  propagation  goverened  by  the  nonlinear 

Schrödinger  equation.  In  addition  to  nonlinear  optics,  there  are  numerous  examples  in 

nature  where  such  solitary  waves  and  related  phenomena  are  observed;  particularly  in 

pattern formation in granular systems [9] and complex fluids [10]. 

Recently  Conti et  al.  suggested  the  possibility  of  OSS  formation  and  MI  in  soft 

condensed  matter  systems,  where  local  concentrations  of  constituent  particles  provide 

localised intensity dependent refractive index variations [11,12]. They developed a non-

local  theory  which  relates  the  Kerr  response  to  a  static  structure  factor,  specific  to  the 

constituent  materials.  Colloidal  dispersions  have  long  been  considered  potential 

candidates for artificial Kerr materials. Ashkin and co-workers indicated the potential of 

bulk  colloidal  suspensions  to  act  as  artificial  Kerr  medium  in  a  number  of  nonlinear 

optical  experiments,  including  self-focusing,  optical  bistability  and  four-wave  mixing 

[13-15]. The nonlinearity is an electrostrictive effect arising from optical gradient forces 

experienced  by  the  dielectric  particulates,  which  cause  them  to  aggregate  at  regions  of 

 

2

high  intensity,  thereby  locally  increasing  the  refractive  index  and  leading  to  a  self-

focusing effect [16]. 

In this Letter we present an experimental system, based on an optical waveguide-

geometry, to explore the nonlinear optical properties of large-scale colloidal aggregates. 

We  show  that  the  nonlinear  behaviour  of  the  system  leads  to  observation  of  optically-

induced  self  organization  and  particularly  that  colloidal  arrays  formed  along  the  laser 

propagation-axis  are  linked  to  the  break-up  of  the  incident  field  into  OSS,  and  that  the 

lateral spacing of the arrays is related to modulation instability of the nonlinear coupled 

light-matter system. These results represent the first conclusive experimental realization 

of both MI and OSS arrays in colloidal suspensions [11,12]. We note Yashin et al. have 

indicated  the  formation  of  soliton-like  beams  bulk  colloidal  samples  but  stress  that  no 

conclusive demonstration of spatial solitons or any inference of MI was forthcoming in 

that study [16]. 

For  the  experimental  work  a  prism-coupled  resonant  dielectric  waveguide  was 

used  to  generate  counter-propagating  (CP)  waveguide  modes  with  an  evanescent  wave 

(EW) component extending in to the colloidal solution (see figure 1). Transverse optical 

gradient forces due to the EW acting on particles in proximity to the supporting surface 

result  in  the  accumulation  of  particles  at  the  centre  of  the  illuminated  area,  where  the 

scattering  forces  due  to  the  CP  fields  along  the  propagation  (x)  axis  are  balanced  [17]. 

The dielectric waveguide constrains the field profile perpendicular to the waveguide to be 

the  lowest  order  mode  along  the  z-axis:  this  effectively  eliminates  one  transverse 

dimension (z) leaving the propagation axis x and transverse dimension y.  This particular 

 

3

design maximises the non-linear effects of the colloidal dispersion by using a waveguide 

design with a mode that has an enhanced field strength in the sample solution [18]. 

Resonant dielectric waveguides were fabricated by depositing an optical bi-layer 

coating  of  SiO2  and  ZrO2  on  to  a  high  refractive  index  SF11  (np  =  1.754  @  1064  nm) 

glass  prism.  In  this  configuration,  the  ZrO2  layer  formed  the  core  of  the  waveguide, 

whilst  the  SiO2  layer  provided  coupling  to  the  prism  and  acted  as  the  bottom  cladding 

layer. The thickness and refractive index of the layers were chosen so that the waveguide 

supported  a  single  TE  mode  (for  λ=1064  nm)  when  an  aqueous  solution  of  colloidal 

particles  is  placed  on  the  top  the  guiding  layer.  Colloidal  preparations  were  made  by 

diluting mono-dispersed 410 nm polymer colloids (Duke Scientific) in de-ionized water. 

A 100 μm thick circular sample chamber (1cm diameter) containing 20 μL of the solution 

was placed on the top of the prism in direct contact with coated surface.  

Optical  trapping  was  achieved  using  two  CP  waveguide  modes  excited  through 

the prism coupler. In this geometry TE polarized light from a 1064 nm, Yb-doped fibre 

laser (IPG) was weakly focused onto the coupling layer / prism interface at an angle of 

approximately 60°; the spot size in at the sample surface in lateral direction was 100 µm. 

A second beam, coupled through the opposite prism face, was used to excite the opposing 

mode; the two beams where not temporally coherent. The relative power in each arm was 

also adjusted to achieve stable trapping at the centre of the trap; all powers quoted in the 

paper refer to the accumulative power in both arms. Observations of the colloid dynamics 

were monitored with a long working distance microscope objective (50x, NA=0.42 and 

10x, NA=0.28) and a CCD camera.

Sub-micrometer  colloids  accumulated  in  the  trap  at  high  incident  powers  were 

observed  to  form  regularly  spaced  linear  arrays  oriented  along  the  direction  of  the 

incident EW wavevector with a lateral separation of several micrometers, whilst particles 

within  the  linear  arrays  were  arranged  in  a  disordered  manner  and  exhibited  strong 

thermal motion. The presence of large numbers of particles in the illuminated region was 

necessary  to  invoke  the  observed  pattern  formation.  Video  stills  of  the  array  formation 

are  shown  in  figure  2  for  a  solution  of  410  nm  colloidal  particles  (concentration 

equivalent  to  0.1%  solid)  accumulated  in  the  counter-propagating  cavity-enhanced 

evanescent wave trap (total incident power = 600 mW). Linear arrays, formed along the 

propagation  direction  of  the  evanescent  waves,  are  regularly  separated  in  the  lateral 

direction  with  a  periodicity  of  approximately  10  μm.  We  observe  linear  arrays  under  a 

range  of  experimental  conditions  including,  different  concentrations  of  colloids  and 

different sized particles (200-600 μm diameter).   

We associate and explain this new type of optically-induced self-organized array 

formation with the observation of arrays of OSS formed by the breakup of the waveguide 

mode  through  MI.  (Due  to  the  presence  of  waveguide  losses  and  external  pumping  via 

the prism coupler we are strictly dealing with solitary waves as opposed to solitons, but 

we shall not dwell on the distinction here.)  Qualitatively the observed ordering exhibits a 

number  of  properties  that  are  suggestive  of  the  presence  of  OSS.  Firstly,  a  power 

threshold exists below which particles are accumulated but no ordering is observed, even 

over  extended  periods  of  illumination.    Above  this  power  threshold,  stable  arrays  are 

formed  with  a  characteristic  spacing,  which  extend  beyond  the  footprint  of  the 

illuminated area in the propagation direction. (With only one of the CP waveguide modes 

 

5

present the linear arrays still form but the colloids move along the direction of the mode 

under  the  action  of  the  scattering  force.)    The  spacing  between  the  arrays  in  the  lateral 

direction  decreases  with 

increasing  power,  until  arrays  become  unstable  and 

spontaneously evolve leading to merging and branching of arrays. A cross-section of the 

arrays, taken in the lateral direction and averaged over the propagation direction, clearly 

highlights the periodic nature of the linear array formation. From a simple analysis of the 

image the spacing between linear arrays is found to be 8.7 ± 0.6 μm. This characteristic 

spacing  is  similar  for  a  range  of  different  sample  preparations,  e.g.  diluted  samples 

(0.1%) and smaller sized colloids (200 nm): only the power threshold for observing the 

arrays changes significantly.  

We  now  give  a  précis  of  the  underlying  theory  for  comparison  with  the 

experiment.    Since  array  formation  persists  with  only  one  of  the  CP  waveguide  modes 

present, and the CP modes are mutually incoherent, here we examine the unidirectional 

propagation  case.  Then  for  a  prism  coupled  nonlinear  planar  waveguide,  wave 

propagation  along  the  x-axis  may  be  described  by  the  nonlinear  Schrödinger  equation

expressions for the above coefficients are given Liao et al.[19] and Stegeman et al. [20]. 

 

To  understand  the  pattern  forming  properties  of  the  nonlinear  prism  coupler  we 

consider  the  stability  properties  of  the  high  power  plane-wave  solution  with  respect  to 

spatial modulations along the lateral dimension.[6-8] To proceed we consider a perturbed 

plane-wave  solution  of  the  form

where we have added weak spatial side-bands to the strong plane-wave solution 

0a  of Eq. 

1, obtained by setting the spatial derivatives to zero. If the spatial side-bands grow they 

will  create  a  spatial  modulation  of  the  intensity,  and  hence  colloid  density,  of  period  L 

along the lateral or y-dimension.  Substituting the perturbed plane-wave solution into the 

NLSE  (1),  and  linearizing  in  the  weak  spatial  side-bands,  one  obtains  four-wave 

parametrically coupled equations for the side-bands.  By demanding that the four-wave 

parametric  interaction  is  phase  matched  we  obtain  the  condition  on  the  spatial  period

From the theoretical analysis it is clear that the combined optical properties of the 

underlying  dielectric  waveguide  and  the  colloidal  suspension,  and  in  particular  the 

effective  loss  coefficient  of  the  system,  play  an  important  role  in  determining  the 

properties of the linear arrays.  By experimentally determining the loss coefficient αeff  we 

may  predict  the  lateral  array  spacing  (2)  at  threshold  that  can  be  compared  with  the 

experiment for internal consistency.  From a fit of the experimentally measured variation 

of the low power reflectivity of the prism coupled waveguide versus incident angle (not 

shown)  we  estimate  the  effective  loss-coefficient  as  αeff  =110  cm-1.  Using  Eq.  (2)  with 

η=1  we  obtain  a  threshold  periodicity  Lth  =10  μm,  in  reasonable  agreement  with  the 

experimental value.  This implies that for our current experiment the lateral array spacing 

is  sufficiently  large  that  nonlocality  is  not  a  major  player,  since  for  a  local  response

 we have S(q)= const., and η=1. 

From  the  model  we  also  find  the  array  spacing  above  threshold  is  power

  parametrically  as  a 

function of ξ according to Eqs. (3) we have a prediction of how the lateral array spacing 

varies with input power. Within the confines of our Kerr nonlinear model the lateral array 

spacing  decreases  monotonically  with  increasing  input  power  beyond  the  threshold. 

Figure  4  shows  a  plot  of  average  array  spacing  as  a  function  of  the  input  power  along 

with  the  theoretical  prediction  obtained  with  η=1.  The  experimental  data  has  been 

normalized  with  respect  to  the  threshold  array  spacing  and  threshold  input  power.    We 

see  that  there  is  good  overall  agreement  between  the  theory  and  experiment,  and  in 

particular that the array spacing decreases with increasing power as expected in the array 

formation is due to MI. 

It is important to note that the ideas of OSS and MI arise here because we have 

employed  a  continuum  approximation  to  the  colloidal  system,  that  is,  we  have 

approximated the colloidal system as soft matter and ignored its granular structure. This 

importance  of  the  granular  nature  of  the  nonlinear  medium,  particular  near  the  limit  of 

continuum  approximation  is  highlighted  by  our  observation  that  the  lateral  spacing 

between the arrays begins to decrease with increasing particle size and the emergence of 

more complicated pattern formation when colloidal particles begin to cluster.   

9

We further contend that even for colloidal systems for which the granular nature 

is  more  important,  the  ideas  of  pattern  formation  are  still  of  use  for  intuiting  the 

underlying physics.  In particular, continuum models have previously been of great utility 

in understanding the pattern forming properties of granular media [21]. MI in nonlinear 

systems  may  also  lead  to  more  complex  pattern  formation,  such  as  two-dimensional 

square lattices, hexagonal and spiral type formation; this may be achieved by driving the 

system  well  above  the  threshold  [21].  It  is  also  known  that  interaction  forces  do  exist 

between  solitons,  such  as  attractive  forces  between  in-phase  coherent  OSS  [2];  these 

forces may play a role in the ordering of higher order solitons. Furthermore by driving the 

system  externally,  by  for  example,  modulation  of  the  input  beam,  different  types  of 

localised waves, such as oscillons, may be observed [9] . 

An  interesting  parallel  may  be  drawn  between  the  OSS/MI  interpretation  of 

optical force induced self-organization of colloidal dispersions and optical force mediated 

particle-particle interactions observed in optical binding; particularly in light of the recent 

reports  of  two-dimensional  checkerboard-like  array  formation  in  counter-propagating 

evanescent  wave  trapping  geometry,  similar  to  the  one  described  here  [22].  Optical 

binding arise when particles locally perturb the incident field through refocusing and/or 

scattering, to create new stable trapping position for adjacent particles to occupy. Whilst 

longitudinal binding (i.e. binding along the propagation axis) has been well characterized 

in a number of trapping geometries [23,24], the origin of lateral binding is still not well 

established.  A  non-linear  systems  approach  may  provide  further  insights  into  the 

observed pattern formation for such lateral binding, although in this case the granularity 

of the system would become increasingly important. 

 

10

In  conclusion  we  have  presented  experimental  evidence  for  the  observation  of 

modulational instability and formation of optical spatial solitons arrays in soft condensed 

matter.  Our  experiments  performed  on  sub-micron  colloidal  dispersions  offer  the  first 

conclusive  demonstration  in  such  media  of  these  nonlinear  phenomena  and  the 

observations are supported by theoretical calculations. The experimental system that we 

have  developed  here  is  an  excellent  platform  for  exploring  more  general  properties  of 

optically-induced  nonlinear  instability  in  colloidal  systems.  Finally  the  light  matter 

interaction  has  also  been  noted  for  smaller  numbers  of  colloid  to  organise  into 

equilibrium positions due to the gradient and scattering forces: our work may also link to 

such  lateral  (or  transverse)    “optical  binding”  which  remains  a  promising  but  not  well 

understood method for optically controlled self assembly of particles [22,25].

the threshold. Each panel is a CCD image of the illuminated region at different times 
after the light is coupled to the system. Bright field imaging also confirms the presence of 
ordered colloids in regions of high intensity. 
 
Figure 3: The graph on the left shows in the period of the array spacing as a function of 
the input power above threshold. The period (L) is normalized with respect to the period 
at  threshold  (Lth)  and  the  input  coupling  power  (P)  is  normalized  to  the  power  at 
threshold  (Pth).  The  solid  line  indicates  the  variation  as  predicted  by  the  continuum 
model. The three panels on the right show the array formations for different illumination 
intensities.  Below  the  threshold  the  OSS  are  not  observed  (top),  even  after  extended 
periods of illumination; just above threshold stable arrays of OSS are formed.

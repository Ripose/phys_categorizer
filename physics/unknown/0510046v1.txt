Abstract  The  problem  tackled  in  this  study  is  one  of  MIMO  transceiver  implementation  in  which  we

consider how to design and test compact antenna arrays that have the ability to preserve the native information

bearing capacity of a MIMO channel. Mutual coupling in antenna arrays is known to degrade the performance of

a  MIMO  system.  However,  no  tests  involving  compact  arrays  have  been  performed  using  a  MIMO  transceiver

architecture that is capable of measuring the effect of mutual coupling on system performance. In this study, two

novel compact MIMO antenna arrays were designed and integrated into a wideband MIMO radio testbed. These

arrays are extremely compact yet have acceptable mutual coupling and radiation efficiency and resonate in three

wide frequency bands. A measurement campaign was executed in which MIMO channel sounding measurements

were  taken  using  the  compact  arrays  and  dipole  arrays  in  a  variety  of  indoor  environments.  The  MIMO

transceiver used for channel sounding is able to measure the effect of mutual coupling on system performance. A

comparison of the relative performance between the compact antenna arrays, dipole arrays and the i.i.d. Gaussian

channel is presented. Results show that the proposed compact arrays outperformed dipole arrays in all scenarios

and that MIMO capacity does not scale linearly in the number of antennas if the antenna arrays exhibit mutual

coupling.

I. INTRODUCTION

A  well  known  result  from  information  theory  proves  that  an  upper  limit  exists  for  the  average  spectral

efficiency of radio communications over a Gaussian channel using a single transmitter antenna and single receiver

antenna [1]. This limit can be overcome by radios with multiple transmit antennas and multiple receive antennas

that  treat  the  Gaussian  channel  as  a  Multiple  Input  Multiple  Output  (MIMO)  channel,  [2],  [3].  Not  only  can

MIMO overcome the limit proved in [1], but the average capacity of a

environment  induces  spatial  correlation  in  the  MIMO  channel  [4].  Theoretical  models  and  measurement  results

show  that  correlation  between  the

MIMO Gaussian channel, [5], [6]. The mechanisms for correlation are mutual coupling in the antenna arrays and

a narrow multipath spread in the propagation channel, [7], [8]. Both mechanisms cause increased correlation when

the antenna array's inter-element spacing shrinks. Such a scenario is a problem in portable MIMO enabled devices

where the array must be shrunk into a volume whose dimensions are typically measured in fractions of the carrier

frequency wavelength.

The problem tackled in this study is one of MIMO transceiver implementation in which we consider how to

design  and  fabricate  compact  antenna  arrays  that  preserve  the  native  information  bearing  capacity  of  a  MIMO

channel.  A  summary  of  select  prior  works  relevant  to  this  problem  puts  the  current  state  of  a  solution  in

perspective. A comprehensive overview of MIMO antenna and propagation studies is to be found in [9].  MIMO

channel  capacity  measurements  using  compact  arrays  with  inter-element  spacings

 Î#

  have  been  reported

[11],  [12],  [13],  [14].  However,  the  channel  sounders  used  to  make  these  measurements  used  time-multiplexed

switching between the radios and the array elements or used a single movable antenna to create a virtual array in

space.  Uncorrelated  phase  noise  across  antennas  in  time-multiplexed  sounders  has  been  shown  to  result  in

optimistic  channel  capacity  measurements  [15].  Furthermore,  to  capture  the  effect  of  mutual  coupling  requires

simultaneous excitation of the entire spectral band on all transmit elements and simultaneous signal capture of the

entire  spectral  band  from  all  receiver  elements.    Such  an  excitation  and  capture  scheme  is  true  to  the  actual

signaling architecture used in real MIMO transceivers and is termed "full MIMO". MIMO channel capacity has

been  characterized  as  a  function  of  antenna  array  topology  using  a  full  MIMO  testbed  [6,  10].  However,  these

studies  only  considered  narrowband  channels  and  large  arrays  with  inter-element  spacings

and  the  array  topologies  used  at  the  receiver  were  not  sufficiently  compact  to  observe  an  effect  on  channel

capacity.

The work presented here is an experimental investigation of compact antenna array performance in a MIMO

transceiver that more completely addresses the problem of designing and testing compact MIMO arrays. A two

element antenna array and a four element antenna array were designed using criteria tailored to wideband MIMO

signaling  and  fabricated  for  integration  into  mobile  devices.  These  arrays  are  extremely  compact,  with  inter-

The  remainder  of  the  paper  is  organized  as  follows.  Section  II  gives  a  description  of  the  compact  antenna

array design. Section III details the methodology used in a measurement campaign. Results from the measurement

campaign  are  presented  in  Section  IV.  Observations  drawn  from  the  results  are  given  in  Section  V  along  with

conclusions about the design of compact antenna arrays for MIMO radio communications.

II. COMPACT ARRAY DESIGN

A. Printed Inverted-F Antenna

Printed  Inverted  "F"  Antenna  (PIFA)  designs  have  low  profiles,  good  radiation  characteristics,  and  wide

bandwidth  [18],  [19],  [20].    This  makes  PIFA  an  attractive  choice  for  antenna  designs  targeting  many  current

mobile  wireless  systems.  Another  requirement  of  these  systems  is  support  for  multiple  resonant  frequencies.

However,  standard  PIFA  designs  result  in  a  single  band  antenna  since  the  antenna's  higher  order  resonant

frequencies are not close to its fundamental resonant frequency.  In addition, both the radiation performance and

the return loss of a standard PIFA antenna may render it inefficient for use at these higher resonant frequencies. It

3

has been shown that a PIFA can resonate at a second frequency by using a proper slot on the antenna body [21].

Different shapes and locations of the slot have been proposed for different applications. A PIFA can also be made

to resonate at a second  frequency by including a J-shape slot [22], [23].

A novel tri-band PIFA design was used to produce a two element array and a four element array for use in

portable MIMO enabled devices [16].  The proposed PIFA antenna employs a quarter wavelength slot to provide

the second resonant frequency and a J-shape slot to provide a third resonant frequency. The resulting PIFA has

resonant frequencies at 2.45 GHz, 5.25 GHz, and 5.775 GHz with supporting bandwidths of 100 MHz, 200 MHz,

and 150 MHz respectively.  The single element antenna model with its ground plane is shown in Fig. 1. The PIFA

measures 9mm 17mm 3mm. Fig. 2 shows the measured reflection coefficient of this antenna.

B. PIFA Array

Mutual coupling disturbs the scattering parameter characteristic and radiation pattern of the array's radiating

elements from that of their isolated state [24], [25].  This makes it necessary for the elements in a MIMO antenna

array to be designed jointly. However, a PIFA design is relatively robust to influence from another nearby PIFA

because of the radiating element's low profile and proximity to the ground plane [26]. A two-element PIFA array

was  designed  for  use  in  MIMO  enabled  portable  devices.  The  PIFA  array's  elements  are  separated  by  mm$"

(

-0-
¸ Î%

). The manufactured array is shown in Fig. 3(b) alongside a laptop PCMCIA wireless LAN card, Fig.

3(d), whose footprint it was designed to match. An Ansoft High Frequency Structure Simulator software package

was  employed  to  calculate  the  input  impedance  as  well  as  the  far-field  patterns  of  this  array.  The  MIMO

transceiver testbed into which these compact antenna arrays were integrated operates in the 2.4 – 2.5 GHz band.

We only present the antenna's design for the 2.45 GHz resonant frequency since no system level measurements

were made at the 5 GHz bands.  Fig. 7 shows the far-field pattern of a single PIFA on a ground plane with no

other PIFA elements (as seen in Fig. 1). Figure 8 shows the far-field patterns of a single PIFA on a ground plane

when a second PIFA is located 

$"

 mm away on the ground plane, as seen in Fig. 3(a), and terminated by

.

The  far-field  patterns  are  given  for  two  elevation  planes  (

(

°).  A  comparison  of  Fig.  7  and 

8
 shows that the radiation pattern of a single PIFA remains relatively

unchanged in the presence of a second PIFA.

Fig. 9 presents the scattering matrix of the dual element PIFA array as a function of frequency.  However, it

has  been  shown  that  the  diagonal  elements  of  the  scattering  matrix, 

,  are  not  the  best  characterization  of

radiation efficiency for a multi-port antenna [27]. Some portion of the power accepted by each element will go to

the other ports through coupling between elements. This coupling is characterized by the off diagonal elements,

=34,  of  the  scattering  matrix.  The  combination  of  an  antenna  port's  primary  reflected  signal  with  the  coupled

signals can be constructive or destructive and depends on the phases of the component signals. Each antenna in a

wideband  MIMO  transmitter  is  subjected  to  a  randomly  phased  excitation  signal.  The  signal  phases  are  again

randomized by the propagation environment before arriving at the receiver. MIMO antenna efficiency is then a

function of how randomly phased signals combine and cannot be determined from the traditional scattering matrix

characterization.  A  more  meaningful  measure  of  MIMO  antenna  efficiency,  the  Total  Active  Reflection

Coefficient (TARC) [27], is the ratio of the square root of total reflected power divided by the square root of total

incident power. The TARC can be calculated for the

antenna  system.  The  TARC  is  calculated  for  different  combinations  of  excitation  signals  applied  to  each  port.

Each  excitation  signal  has  unity  magnitude  but  a  random  phase.  This  random  phasing  of  the  excitation  signals

probes the array in ways that cause constructive combining of coupled signals with the primary reflected signal

(worst  case)  and  destructive  combining  of  coupled  signals  with  the  primary  reflected  signal  (best  case).  These

excitation  signals  more  accurately  simulate  wideband  MIMO  signaling  than  do  the  signals  used  in  scattering

matrix  characterization.  Note  that  signals  combine  in  the  linear  scale  (voltages)  whereas  the  resulting  power

signal,  used  in  computing  TARC,  is  the  squared  magnitude  of  the  voltage  signals.  Therefore,  the  TARC  can

increase  rapidly  as  the  number  of  array  elements  increases.  The  TARC  of  the  2-element  PIFA  array  was

calculated for a set of twenty excitation vectors and the results are presented in Fig. 10. The calculated TARC are

lower  than 

*

  dB  for  different  excitation  vector  combinations.  This  implies  that  the  array  has  good  efficiency

across the range of possible MIMO signals.

The design for the 2-element PIFA array was adapted to construct a 4-element array by using both sides of the

ground  plane.  The  resulting  volume  occupied  by  the  four  PIFAs  measures  mm 7mm

shows two perspectives of the manufactured 4-element PIFA array. Two RT-Duroid substrates are attached back-

to-back  to  realize  four  microstrip  lines  to  feed  the  array's  elements.  Due  to  the  small  distance  between  top  and

5

bottom  elements,  a  high  level  of  mutual  coupling  can  be  expected  between  elements  1  and  3  and  between

elements  2  and  4.  However,  lower  mutual  coupling  can  be  expected  between  elements  2  and  3  and  between

elements 1 and 4. Fig. 11 shows one row of the scattering matrix of the 4-element PIFA array. The TARC of the

4-element PIFA array was calculated using four excitation vectors with random phases. The result is presented in

Fig.  12.    We  see  in  comparing  the  TARC  in  Fig.  (10)  and  Fig.  (12)  for  the  two  PIFA  arrays  that  the  TARC

increases rapidly with the number of elements.

We  note  that  matching  networks  or  intermediate  circuits  can  be  used  to  reduce  the  magnitude  of  the  off

diagonal elements of the array's scattering matrix to reduce the TARC and increase the antenna efficiency. Once

such method is proposed in [28].

III. EXPERIMENT DESIGN

The purpose of this study is to characterize the performance of a MIMO system that uses a highly compact

antenna array at one end of the link and an antenna array with low mutual coupling at the other end. Such scenario

is relevant to indoor MIMO system deployments where a base station can support large arrays (

) and

the mobile devices must use compact arrays (

?
.

0 Î#-

). As part of the characterization, we are interested in the

fundamental  relationships  between  array  topology,  channel  structure  and  system  performance.  We  begin  our

discussion of how this characterization was achieved experimentally by defining a mathematical framework for

MIMO systems and presenting relevant results from the literature. A measurement model is then presented that

describes how system performance was estimated from field data. Finally, we describe a measurement procedure

that  was  designed  to  characterize  MIMO  system  performance  using  a  full  MIMO  radio  testbed  that  can  be

outfitted with a variety of array topologies.

A. MIMO System Model

A  primary  measure  of  communication  system  performance  is  spectral  efficiency.  The  upper  bound  on  spectral

efficiency is channel capacity – defined loosely as the information rate density that a channel supports. Capacity

can be defined as a mathematically tractable quantity given a system model and set of simplifying assumptions

[29]. The following model and assumptions are typically made when deriving MIMO channel capacity:

channels can be used to support an independent information stream. It has been established, both in theory [5] and

by measurement [6], that correlation between the elements of

One  of  the  goals  of  the  measurement  campaign  will  be  to  evaluate  system  performance  in  a  variety

propagation  scenarios.  A  difficulty  that  arises  when  comparing  measured  capacity  from  different  measurement

sites is the bias caused by fluctuating SNR between sites. SNR fluctuates because average channel gain changes

from one site to the next and noise power changes as a function of time as radio hardware heats up. One solution

is  to  make  a  comparison  of  system  performance  between  different  sites  using  MIMO  capacity  gain.  This  is

computed from field measurements as,

 is the ensemble average capacity of the Single Input Single Output (SISO) channels represented by

metric for making a fair comparison of system performance across different sites.

Capacity  of  MIMO  systems  with  dimensions  less  than

taken to normalize the average channel gain of the simulated channels to that of the measured channels so that,

C. Setup and Procedure

Over-the-air measurements were executed with a wideband MIMO radio testbed [30]. The testbed has modes

for both MIMO packet communications standards as well as channel sounding [31]. Radios in the testbed meet

the 5% Error Vector Magnitude and 

"'

 MHz spectral mask requirements on transceiver performance set forth by

the IEEE 802.11a standard. A Space-Frequency Orthogonal Multitone (SFOM) channel sounding and estimation

scheme  was  used  to  measure  the  channel  frequency  response,  received  signal  power,  and  receiver  noise  power

[17].  These  measured  quantities  were  then  used  to  compute  capacity  according  to  (7).  The  SFOM  sounding

scheme  employs  the  testbed's  full  MIMO  architecture  and  not  a  time-multiplexed  MIMO  architecture  used  by

switched antenna array channel sounders or virtual antenna array channel sounders. A complete calibration of the

transceiver radios was performed prior to the campaign. Included in this calibration was the measurement of each

radio's gain, phase noise, complex spectrum and frequency offset. Benchmark tests on an Elektrobit C8 MIMO

channel  emulator  were  performed  to  verify  the  testbed's  calibration.  These  benchmarks  included  capacity

measurements for a 2

2 i.i.d. Gaussian channel and a 2

2 perfectly correlated channel. These tests produced

results consistent with the theoretical average capacity given by (3) and (5).

A ULA of dipole antennas was used as a baseline array for providing a performance reference. These dipoles,

shown in Figs. 3(a) and 4, are targeted for commercial 802.11a/b/g base station deployments and have features

that  closely  match  those  of  the  PIFA  (except  in  size).    Similarities  between  these  dipoles  and  the  PIFA  are:

dipole array s-parameters are seen to generally degrade as 

 decreases. Therefore, the radiation efficiency of the

?.

dipole arrays is expected to degrade as the array aperture shrinks.

The  measurement  sites  were  located  in  a  multi-story  building  whose  floorplan  included  laboratories,

classrooms, offices and corridors. Two measurement sites were chosen: a laboratory with electronic equipment,

cubicle partitions and office furniture; a very large empty hall with a few support columns and no furnishings. At

each site, a Line-of-Sight (LOS) and a Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) visibility scenario was chosen for placing the

transmitter  (TX)  and  receiver  (RX)  radios.  Positioning  robots  were  used  to  move  the  transmitter  and  receiver

antenna  arrays  in  over

cm× cm  azimuthal  grid.  These  robots  are  built  exclusively  from  LEGO  components

(!

(all  plastic  except  for  motors  and  wiring)  and  have  a  positioning  precision  of  1.59mm.  Antenna  arrays  were

mounted  on  the  robots  at  a  height  of  m  above  ground.  The  relative  angle  between  the  TX  and  RX  array

endfires ranged between

The measurement setup is summarized in Table 1. The measurement procedure is outlined in Pseudocode 1. A

total  of

  narrowband  channel  matrices  were  recorded  for  each  array  topology  tested  at  a  site  (the

inner  two  loops  of  the  pseudocode).  This  measurement  procedure  hopes  to  collects  many  channel  realizations

across space, time, and frequency so that all degrees of freedom in the channel matrix's randomness are sampled

sufficiently. Given this assumption, the resulting ensemble average capacity,

IV. MEASUREMENT RESULTS

We begin our survey of measurement results with a detailed presentation of results from the NLOS empty hall

scenario.  The  results  from  this  site  exemplify  trends  observed  throughout  the  measurement  campaign.  We

consider channel capacity and channel eigenvalue distributions measured for each type of antenna array. We then

present comprehensive results from all measurement sites so that a performance comparison for different antenna

arrays can be made across a variety of propagation scenarios. Comparisons are made using MIMO capacity gain

and the theoretical capacity of i.i.d. Gaussian channels for reference. Results presented in this paper are limited to

 as these constitute cases where the impact of antenna design

is most obvious in terms of the trends for increasing numbers of antennas.

A. Channel Capacity

 grid of spatial samples. The frequency-averaged capacity is computed according to the

inner sum in (9) using

 discrete frequencies uniformly spaced over a 

"'

 MHz band centered at 

#Þ%*

 GHz. The

average capacities of an i.i.d. Gaussian channel, given by (3), are plotted as solid curves for reference.

Measurements in Fig. 13(a) agree well with the average capacities expected from i.i.d. Gaussian channels. For

the 

% ‚ %

 case, the nominal capacity predicted by (3) at the measured SNR of 

#*Þ*

 dB is 

$%Þ*

 b/s/Hz whereas the

measured capacity from (9) is 

$$Þ&

 b/s/Hz. As the antenna separation decreases first at the transmitter, Fig. 13(b),

and  then  also  at  the  receiver,  Fig.  13(c),  the  measured  capacity  decreases  drastically  (from 

$$Þ&

  b/s/Hz  to 

#(

b/s/Hz  to 

##Þ$

  b/s/Hz  for  the 

% ‚ %

  case).  Shrinking  of  just  the  transmit  array  aperture  is  responsible  for  the

majority (58%) of capacity that is lost when both array apertures shrink. The observed slight decrease in average

SNR, from 

#*Þ*

 dB to 

#)Þ'

 dB to 

#(Þ"

 dB for the 

% ‚ %

 case, is a symptom of increasing impedance mismatch

between the array and the 

&!H

 radios. Impedance mismatch is expected to cause a decrease in the array's radiation

efficiency  and  thus  a  lower  signal  power  at  the  receiver.  However,  (3)  shows  that  MIMO  capacity  has  a

logarithmic dependence on SNR and can only account for a minor part (

 %

 b/s/Hz) of the total loss in capacity

(

""Þ#

  b/s/Hz).  Therefore,  the  dominating  cause  of  lost  capacity  is  attributed  to  the  increasing  correlation  in  the

channel  matrix  as  the  array  apertures  shrink.  Another  observation  to  be  made  from  Fig.  13  regards  the  relative

capacity  loss  between  different  MIMO  configurations.  The 

# ‚ #

  case  is  more  robust  to  changes  in  antenna

spacing than the 

$ ‚ $

 and 

% ‚ %

 cases. Whereas the 

# ‚ #

 capacity drops first to 89% in Fig. 13(b) and then to

80% in Fig. 13(c), the 

$ ‚ $

 and 

% ‚ %

 cases drop first to 81% and 80% and then to 68% and 66% of their level in

Fig. 13(a).

Measurements in Fig. 13(d)(e) are for the same scenario as Figs. 13(b)(c) but with the transmit dipole array

replaced  by  a  4-element  PIFA  array.  For  the 

% ‚ %

  case,  the  capacity  predicted  by  (3)  at  the  measured  SNR  of

#&Þ)

  dB  is 

#*Þ"

  b/s/Hz  whereas  the  measured  capacity  from  (9)  is 

#(Þ'

  b/s/Hz.  This  is  remarkable  because  the

12

PIFA array capacity is 93% of the capacity of an i.i.d. Gaussian channel compared with the 80% of the compact

dipole array for the same 

 (see Fig. 13(b)).

B. Channel Eigenvalue Distribution

Figs. 14, 15, and 16 show the distributions of ordered eigenvalues of the 

 matrix for the measurements

[[s s H

presented  in  Fig.  13(a)(b)(c).  Also  shown  are  the  distributions  of  ordered  eigenvalues  from  a  Monte  Carlo

simulation of i.i.d. Gaussian channels whose channel gain is matched to the measured channel according to (11).

Because the eigenvalues of 

 are a measure of channel "power" in eigen-space, their distributions are plotted

[[s s H

on  a  logarithmic  scale.  Both  measured  and  i.i.d.  Gaussian  channel  eigenvalue  distributions  are  generated  from

histograms over a 

'!

 dB domain with a 

!Þ&

 dB bin spacing using eigenvalues from 

%(&#

 channel matrices.

In  all  cases,  the  measured  eigenvalue  distributions  for  the  SISO  cases  agree  very  well  with  those  expected

from the i.i.d. Gaussian channel. The eigenvalue distributions for the MIMO cases in Figs. 14 and 15 show that,

(TX)

as 

?.

  decreases,  the  mean  of  the  strongest  eigenvalue  increases  while  the  means  of  the  other  eigenvalues

decrease. This is to be expected since an increase in correlation in the channel causes a MIMO channel to behave

more like a SISO channel. The change observed for the 

% ‚ %

 case is drastic and is even more pronounced when

(RX) decreases (Fig. 16).

?.

Fig. 17 shows measurements from the same scenario as those of Figs. 15 but with the transmit dipole array

replaced by a 4-element PIFA array. A direct comparison between these figures shows that the smallest measured

eigenvalues of the PIFA array case deviate less from those of the i.i.d. Gaussian channel. The  

# ‚ #

 case in Fig.

17 shows that the mean of the second eigenvalue deviates slightly more from the i.i.d. Gaussian case than does the

# ‚ # case using dipole arrays. Fig. 18 shows that this deviation is not observed when using the 2-element PIFA

array even under the more demanding scenario when 

(RX) œ "Þ&

?.

Here we return to the observation that the 

# ‚ #

 case showed more robustness than did the 

$ ‚ $

 and 

% ‚ %

cases in Fig. 13(a)(b)(c). Observe, from Figs. 14, 15, and 16, that the distribution of the second eigenvalue does

not change appreciably from that of the i.i.d. Gaussian case until both the transmit and receive arrays have shrunk.

However,  for  the 

$ ‚ $

  and 

% ‚ %

  cases,  the  weakest  eigenvalues  are  seen  to  deviate  appreciably  from  their

corresponding i.i.d. Gaussian channel eigenvalues.

 that are consistently closer to the nominal value of 

 than those of the dipole array. This indicates

!

that the PIFA array is better at preserving the eigen-channels of the near i.i.d. Gaussian propagation channel.

C. Performance Relative to the i.i.d. Gaussian Channel

In this section and the next, we present comprehensive results from all measurement sites. These validate the

generality of trends observed for the NLOS empty hall scenario presented above.

Table 3 summarizes the ratio of the measured average capacity to that of an i.i.d. Gaussian channel for a " ‚ "

SISO  system  and 

# ‚ #ß $ ‚ $ß % ‚ %

  MIMO  systems  using  ULAs  of  dipoles  with  spacings  of

measurement sites provided channels with sufficient multipath to support capacities near that of the i.i.d. Gaussian

channel.

Table  4  compares  the 

# ‚ #

  performance  of  a  dipole  array  and  a  PIFA  array  in  terms  of  the  ratio  of  the

measured average capacity to that of the an i.i.d. Gaussian channel. Table 5 does the same for the 

% ‚ %

 case. In

both tables, the PIFA array not only outperforms the dipole array, but supports most of the capacity of an i.i.d.

Gaussian channel. Furthermore, the dipole spacing required to achieve the same performance as the PIFA array in

the

 case is seen to be

Table 6 shows the ratio of the capacity lost from shrinking one dipole array to the capacity lost from shrinking

both dipole arrays. Typically, a majority of the capacity is lost by decreasing only one of the array's apertures.

In Fig. 20, the ratio of the average measured capacity to the average capacity of an i.i.d. Gaussian channel  at

the  same  SNR  is  plotted  for

# ‚ # $ ‚ $

  and 

% ‚ %

  MIMO  cases.  Measurements  for  each  array  topology  are

averaged over all sites. In all cases, a compact array was used at one end of the link and a dipole array of varying

?. was used at the other end. Capacity ratios closer to unity indicate that the channel behaves more like an i.i.d

Gaussian channel. We see that the 

# ‚ #

 case is fairly robust to increasing correlation (decreasing

D. MIMO Capacity Gain

Fig. 21 shows how 

% ‚ %

MIMO capacity gain varies as a function of the receiver dipole array spacing for

each propagation scenario. Two  array topologies are shown: a dipole transmit array with 

(TX) œ "Þ&

cm and a

compact 4-element PIFA transmit array. The MIMO capacity gain of the PIFA array is consistently closer to the

nominal capacity gain of

 than the dipole array. The general profile of the capacity gain curve shows a threshold

near

above in Fig. 19 for the mean eigenvalue behavior.

A notable anomaly in Fig. 21 is that, for the two LOS lab measurements, capacity gain first increases as the

receiver  array  aperture  shrinks  and  then  finally  drops.  This  result  surprised  the  authors  and  the  measurements

were repeated two weeks later at which time the anomalous results were again observed. It was found that, in the

LOS lab scenario alone, the SISO capacity estimate,

This caused the MIMO capacity gain ratio to increase for

The  MIMO  capacity  gain  for

we  see  the  PIFA  array  outperforming  the  dipole  array.  Unlike  the 

% ‚ %

  case,  the  PIFA  array  does  not  lose

capacity  gain  when

presented in Fig. 18 where the eigen distributions are is still nearly that of the i.i.d Gaussian channel. Note also

that the LOS lab measurements capacity gain initially increases as seen in the 

% ‚ %

 case.

Finally,  we  present  results  for  a 

# ‚ #

  system  in  Fig.  23  in  which  only  elements  1  and  2  of  the  4-element

PIFA  array  were  used.  We  see  that  the  4-element  array  performs  as  well  as  the  2-element  PIFA  array  until

best results of any element pairing. Elements 1 and 2 had the second best scattering parameter set (element pairs

efficiency and resonate in three wide frequency bands. A measurement campaign was executed in which a MIMO

transceiver  testbed  was  outfitted  with  the  compact  arrays  and  dipole  arrays  of  varying  topology.  Channel

sounding  measurements  were  taken  using  each  array  in  a variety  of  indoor  environments.  A  comparison  of  the

relative performance between the compact antenna arrays, the dipole arrays and the i.i.d. Gaussian channel was

presented. The following observations can be made from the measurement results:

i) 

PIFA  Performance

:  The  radiation  pattern  and  efficiency  of  the  proposed  Printed  Inverted-F  Antenna

design  was  similar  to  that  of  a  like-featured  but  much  larger  dipole  antenna.  Furthermore,  the

characteristics of the individual PIFA in a compact array remained relatively unchanged from those of

the  isolated  PIFA  because  of  low  mutual  coupling  between  elements.  These  properties  of  the  PIFA

make it ideal for use in MIMO antenna arrays.

ii) 

Multipath Richness

: All measurement sites provided channels with sufficient multipath to allow 

" ‚ "

SISO  systems  and 

# ‚ #ß $ ‚ $ß % ‚ %

  MIMO  systems  to  achieve  capacities  near  that  of  an  i.i.d.

e

f

Gaussian channel using a uniform linear array of dipoles with spacings of 

"-0-

. This indicates that, on

average,  the  channel's  multipath  is  sufficiently  rich  to  support  nearly  four  independent  channels  in

eigen-space.

iii) 

Impedance Mismatch vs. Channel Correlation

: The loss of SNR, due to impedance mismatch between

dipole  antenna  arrays  and  radio  hardware,  accounted  for  a  minor  portion  of  the  capacity  loss

experienced when shrinking the dipole arrays. Changes in eigenvalue distribution of the channel matrix,

caused  by  the  increasing  correlation  in  the  channel,  accounted  for  the  major  portion  of  lost  capacity.

This result prioritizes the design requirements for MIMO antenna arrays.

iv) 

Single  vs.  Dual  Compact  Arrays

:  When  using  uniform  linear  arrays  of  dipoles,  a  majority  of  the

capacity that can be lost by decreasing the array aperture at both the transmitter and receiver is typically

lost  when  only  one  side's  array  aperture  decreases.  This  result  is  relevant  to  indoor  MIMO  system

deployments  where  a  base  station  can  support  large  arrays (

) and the mobile devices must

use compact arrays (

PIFA Array vs. Dipole Array Performance

: In a 

 (

) MIMO system with a dipole spacing of

"-0-  at receiver ULA, the 4-element (2-element) PIFA transmit array achieved 93-97% (98-100%) of

the i.i.d. Gaussian average capacity while the dipole transmit array only achieved 80-87% (85-100%) of

the i.i.d. Gaussian average capacity.

Capacity Scaling

: Consider the case of a MIMO system using Uniform Linear Array of dipoles with a

 at one end of the link. It was observed that the 

# ‚ #

 configuration was far

more robust to capacity loss with decreasing dipole separation at the other end of the link than were the

  configurations.  However,  the  same  degree  of 

$ ‚ $

  and

  capacity  loss  was  less

evident with the PIFA arrays. Here, the relevant difference between the

 dipole array and

the PIFA array is that the first suffers strongly from mutual coupling while the second does not. This

suggests  that  MIMO  capacity  does  not  scale  linearly  with

the  presence  of  correlation  induced  by  the  propagation  channel  [4],  [16].  However,  mutual  coupling

appears to be the dominating cause of correlation when antenna spacing is

 .

viii) 

Coupling/Efficiency Tradeoff

:  Despite the robust performance of the 

# ‚ #

 configuration, it was seen

from a TARC analysis of the compact PIFA arrays and from the measured drop in SNR with shrinking

dipole array aperture that coupling should be minimized if the radiation efficiency is to be maximized.

Therefore,  although  mutual  coupling  may  not  cause  an  appreciable  loss  in 

# ‚ #

  MIMO  system

capacity,  compact  antenna  arrays  should  still  be  designed  to  minimize  mutual  coupling  in  order  to

maximize radiation efficiency.

ix) 

Multi-Mode MIMO

: In all scenarios of a 

# ‚ #

 MIMO configuration with a dipole spacing 

  Î-0-

4 at

receiver  ULA,  using  only  2  channels  of  the  4-element  PIFA  array  at  the  transmitter  yielded  similar

performance  to  the  2-element  PIFA  array and better performance than the dipole arrays with a larger

aperture. Therefore, the 4-element PIFA array is an excellent candidate for milti-mode transceiver links

that adapt their signaling from 

" ‚ "

 up to 

% ‚ %

 MIMO using a 4-element arrays.

The fact that these observations are consistent for both LOS and NLOS scenarios in two very different indoor

propagation  environments  suggests  that  they  hold  more  generally  for  indoor  MIMO  system  deployment.  These

17

observations  strongly  motivate  the  need  for  careful  design  of  compact  antenna  arrays  used  in  MIMO  enabled

mobile devices.

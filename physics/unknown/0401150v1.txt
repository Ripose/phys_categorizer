Introduction: Among the problems yet to be 
solved by current theories of solar system formation 
is the origin of the Jupiter–family comets. These 
comets are characterized by relatively short orbital 
periods as compared to comets originating from the 
Oort cloud. Most are thought to come from the trans-
Neptunian region known as the Kuiper Belt, a region 
filled with planetesimals that have remained almost 
undisturbed since the birth of the solar system. 
However, it is also possible that some of these 
objects could have come from thin but stable rings of 
planetesimals lying between the existing giant planets 
[1]. Another interesting open question is whether the 
recently suggested migration of protoplanets could be 
due to interactions with nearby planetesimal swarms. 
This possibility is bolstered by the discovery [2] that 
planetesimal swarms having mass densities larger 
than a critical value can trigger significant migration 
in nearby protoplanets. Such a process could provide 
a clue toward explaining the recent discovery of 
extrasolar planets orbiting at small distances from 
their parent stars. 
 

Simulation Model: A fifth-order Runge-Kutta 

algorithm was implemented to examine the above 
theories. The model integrated the trajectories of both 
the planets and planetesimals as they orbited the Sun. 
All simulations begin with four planets (Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and 496 planetesimals, 
resulting in a total of 500 bodies (excluding the Sun) 
being tracked. The initial positions and velocities of 
the giant planets are shown in Table 1 and were 
determined using orbital parameters listed in 
previously published works [3]. The planetesimals 
are placed in circular, coplanar orbits with their 
semimajor axes uniformly scattered over a range 
between 20 and 30 AU from the Sun, and their 
velocities initially defined to be Keplerian. Each 
simulation collects data over a 20,000 year period. 
Unlike many simulations in the literature, the effects 
of the mutual gravitational forces between all the 
bodies in the system were taken into account. This 
allows for an explicit examination of the reaction of 
the giant planets to the presence of the smaller 
bodies. A complete investigation of such interparticle 
forces is necessary to determine how such 
planetesimal rings might affect the stability of the 
system as a whole.  

 
Results and Conclusions: Fig. 1 shows the final 

state for planetesimals remaining within the ring at 
the end of the simulation, revealing their final values 

for semimajor axes and eccentricities (which are 
shown on a natural logarithmic scale). One easily 
distinguishable feature is the apparent depletion of 
planetesimals in the 20-21 AU and 28-29 AU 
regions. These gaps are most likely explained by the 
presence of Uranus and Neptune since mean motion 
resonances associated with these planets can increase 
the eccentricities of the planetesimals, eventually 
causing them to be scattered out of the ring.   Fig. 1 
also shows a peak in the 25-26 AU range, which is 
consistent with Holman’s [1] identification of an 
enhanced stability region between 24 and 27 AU. 
Interestingly, Fig. 1 also shows that the majority of 
planetesimals having low final eccentricities (< 0.01) 
are found in this region as well. As a result, these 
planetesimals would be those most likely to produce 
a stable ring for any extended period of time. Taken 
together, the above seems to imply that a 
planetesimal ring could exist in this region. 
 

If such a stable ring existed, it might provide the 

critical mass density needed to trigger the 
aforementioned migration process. Since (as 
mentioned) the majority of planetesimals in regions 
close to the semimajor axes of Uranus and Neptune 
are scattered out of the system, it is logical to assume 
these two planets would interact more strongly with 
such a planetesimal ring than would either Jupiter or 
Saturn. The data given in Table 2 verifies this 
assumption, showing that Neptune does indeed 
migrate inward as the planetesimal mass increases, 
with this motion reaching a maximum when the 
planetesimal masses exceed 10-3 Earth masses. This 
yields a ring mass of 4.96x10-1 Earth masses, a 
figure which is in rough agreement with Holman’s 
[1] observational maximum mass limit. As can be 
seen, Neptune only shows significant migration when 
the local planetesimal mass density exceeds 0.13 
kg/m3 , the critical density derived from Holman’s 
formula [1]. Any such motion ends at the gap 
between 28 and 29 AU. It can also be seen from the 
data that Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus would be 
affected by scattered planetesimals as well. A slight 
inward drift by Jupiter and an outward drift by Saturn 
are the primary results of interactions with the 
planetesimals that are scattered into those parts of the 
Solar System.  

 

Thus, the data suggests that planetesimal swarms 
might also (at least partially) explain protoplanetary 
migration.

Abstract

A  continuous  approximation  for  the  results  of  [1]  is  obtained.  In  this  approximation  the
energy  distribution  is  represented  in  the  form  of  the  product  of  the  Gibbs  factor  and
superstatistics factor. The mutual weights of the factors are defined by the control parameter of
the  problem.  Various  approximations  for  the  superstatistics  factor  are  written.  The  resulting
distribution  is  compared  to  a  number  of  known  results  (multiplicative  noise,  Van  der  Pol
generator  etc).  It  is  applied  to  the  description  of  self-organized  criticality,  statistics  of  cosmic
rays etc as well.

Here we assumed that  f(β1r1/β0r0) is the probability density for a random y(x)=β(х)r(х)/β0r0 to
take on a specific value y1=β1r1/β0r0 under the condition that a system is located at the point x of
the potentially possible states considered as a continuous random value (although the initial set
of  potential  values  is  a  discrete  set).  Like  in  [1],  we  wrote  (Pkvkαk)/u=rk    and  represented  the
exponent  in  (2)  as  –y1β0r0E,  y1=(β1r1/β0r0),  taking  β0r0E  the  argument  of  the  characteristic
function. Then the integrand in the rhs  of  (2)  is  the  Laplas transform  for  the  distribution  f`(y1)
with argument β0r0E.

The  averaging  over  r1  can  be  viewed  as  well  from  the  isothermic-isobaric  fV(p,q)=Q-1
(β,P,N)exp{-β(H(p,q)+PV)};  Q=∫exp{-β(H(p,q)+PV)}dzdV;  H=E  is  the  energy  [2],  where  the
variable  V  (volume)  fluctuates.  In  open  system  with  the  potential  of  a  kind  Fig.2  [1]  an  extra
factor αvβ appears, accounting for the exchange with surrounding (value α) and the fluctuations
of the inverse temperature β and values of P, v, α.  It is supposed in (1)-(2) that the energy E and
volume V are random extensive quantities, but their ratio (energy density) u=E/V is nonrandom
intensive variable. Like in (8) of [1] we assume β=1/kBT=βGibbs; value β=1/kBT corresponds to
average inverse temperature of full system; kBT characterizes the conveniently averaged energy
for full system. It is assumed that β does not generally coincide with <β>=β0=∫β1f(β1r1)d(β1r1).
Similarly we assume that the pressure P for the total system does not coincide with the averaged
pressure P0=<P>=∫P1f(β1r1)d(β1r1) with averaging over all subsystems, and rf=αP/u for the total
system,  where  α  and  P  are  α=γ/λ  and  pressure  for  the  total  system,  need  not  coinciding  with
average

r0=<r>=∫ rf(r)dr;     r0=<αPv/u>;     α=γ/λ,     α0=∫ α1f(β1r1)d(β1r1),

r=Pvα/u;   where u=E/V; α0=<α>=∑

[1] is intensity of energy flow in the system (subsystem), equal in dynamical equilibrium to an
output  intensity  [3].  If  in  (2)  we  consider  the  system  without  fluctuations  of  value  r  and  set
f(β1r1/β0r0)=δ(β1r1/β0r0 -1), then p(E)∼exp{-(β+β0r0)E}. In this case assume that p(E)∼exp{-β0E},
and  thus  we  get  β0=β+β0r0,  β0=β/(1-r0).  For  a  case  of  one  class  of  ergodic  states,  when

lnQ=βPV, p(E)∼exp{-(β+βrf)E}, p(E)∼exp{-β0E}, one gets βrf=β0r0; rf=β0r0/β. Replacing β1 by
β1=1/kBT`=1/kBT1(r,t), the fluctuating value of temperature, we get:

p(E)=exp{-βE}ω(E)Z-1  ∫

where fB  is the Boltzmann factor, fA and pA corresponds to the type-A superstatistics from [4]. For
f(y1)=δ(y1-1) we obtain from (3) the ordinary Boltzmann factor. Equality β1r1=β0r0  is possible at
β1≈β0,  αkVkPk≈αVP.  As  in  [5],  we  can  write  p(E)=exp{-β0(1-r0)E}ω(E)Z-1exp{-β0r0E}[1+

σ2E2/2+O(σ3E3)]=exp{-β0E}ω(E)Z-1[1+(q`-1)(β0r0)2E2+g(q`)(β0r0)3E3+…],  where  (q`-1)=σy

q`=<y2>; (q`-1)1/2=σy; σy
parameter is equal to β1r1 instead of β as in [5]; β0r0=<β1r1>= ∫β1r1f(β1r1)d(β1r1), function g(q`)
depends on the superstatistics chosen [5]. For f=fG  from (17) [1], (2), q`=q=qTs [6,7]. For others

f:  q`=qBC  [5].  For  any  distribution  f(β1r1)  with  average  β0r0=<β1r1>  and  variance  σ2  we  can
p(E)∼exp{-β0(1-r0)E}<exp{-y1β0r0E}>=exp{-β0E}<exp{-(y1-1)β0r0)E}>=exp{-β0E}[1+
write 

(-1)r<(y1-1)r>(β0r0) r E r] similarly [5]. Thus, low energy asymptotics of the

obtained  distribution    (3)    coincides  with  the  asymptotics  of  superstatistics  [8].  But  the  high
energy asymptotics differs from the asymptotics obtained in  [8] (Fig. 3).

If one performs the replacement of variables β`=β+r1β1 and assumes that the situation β=0
is  possible,  when  the  bottom  limit  of  integration  in  (3)  after  replacement  of  a  variable  is  0,

instead  of  (3)  we  shall  obtain  that  p(E)=ω(E)Z-1 ∫

f1(β`)exp{-β`E}dβ`,    f1(β`)=f(β1r1)=  f[β`-

β0(1-r0)], that coincides with superstatistics [5]. But the correlation (3) describes a more general
situations and superstatistics forms here a special case (3). The value r0=α0(P0v0/u). For ideal gas
P/u≈0,687.

It is possible to mention some examples of physical realization of distribution (3). So, for a
case of superdiffusion in [9] at the absence of external force stationary distribution is in Tsallis
form,  and  for  a  case  of  presence  of  constant  external  force  and  multiplicative  noise  in
exponential form of distribution is manifested. As in (3), in one phenomenon for one system two
kinds of distribution are combined (see also Sections 3, 4).

Besides  the  stated  scheme  there  are  also  other  opportunities of  realizing  the  distributions
such as (3) and generalizations of the theory of superstatistics. Except for distributions (17) - (18)
[1] for density of probability of lifetime in the structural factor ω(E,Γ) (16) [1] can consider other
distributions  as  well.  Since  the  phase  space  of  complex  systems  gets  intricate  fractal  structure
[10] it is natural to build a distribution on a fractal substrate. As distribution f in (3) it is possible
to choose a fractal distributions as in [11] or their generalizations on a case of multifractals, and
also other distributions used in [5]. Other various combinations of different distributions in the

3

different  purposes  are  possible  as  well.  The  obtained  distribution  of  a  kind  (3)  gives  the  wide
opportunities of the description of various physical situations.

In  [12]  it  is  shown  that  the  temperature  fluctuations  can  be  described  by  the  gamma-
distribution.  As  in  [5]  for  distribution  function  f  in  (3)  as  gamma-distribution  such  as  (17)  [1]
(but  with  variables  αk=c,  bk=b;  f(y)=Γ-1(c)b-c(y)c-1exp{-y/b})  expression  (3)  reduces  to  the
product of Gibbs distribution and Tsallis distribution of a kind

p(E)=exp{-βE}ω(E)Z-1(1+bE)-c=

=exp{-βE}ω(E)Z-1[1+(q-1)β0r0E]-1/(q-1);      c=1/(q-1);      b=q-1.              (4)

At  q→1  one  gets  from  (4)  the  expression  exp{-β0E},  which  at  r0=0  yields  Gibbs  distribution
exp{-βE}. In (4) we can separate the Tsallis temperature, βq=βTs =βr0/(1-r0) =β0r0 . Thus we do
have three different “temperatures”: Gibbs one (8) from [1] β=βGibbs=1/kBT=β0(1-r0); effective
temperature  β0=βeff=β/(1-r0);  and  Tsallis 
temperature  βq=βTs=β0r0=βr0/(1-r0).  Following
relations between them and r0, rf  values hold:

β0=β+βq;         rf=β0/β-1=βq/β;        r0=1-β/β0=βq/β0.                                             (5)

Similar  conjectures  can  be  obtained  by  means  of  the  isothermic-isobaric  ensemble  as  well  [2].
For  other  distributions  different  from  (17)  [1]  and  (4)  we  can  get  different  expressions  for  the
corresponding  temperatures  βq.  In  such  a  manner  besides  the  choice  of  the  distribution
parameters (17) of [1] made in [1] and (4), in [4,13] one averages the value (β/2π)1/2exp{-βu2/2}
using the χ2 –distribution; in this case the factor (β/2π)1/2 results in the change of the parameter b
~
=2β0r0/[2-(q-1)].  Correspondingly  one
in  (4).  For  the  Tsallis  distribution  one  gets    βTs=βq= β

~
should set bc= β

/β0r0 =2/[2-(q-1)] for this case.

It  is  obvious  that  distribution  (3)  represents  the  product  of  Boltzmann  factor  with  a
multiplier  superstatistics  from  which  Tsallis  distribution  as  a  special  case  can  be  obtained
(having  chosen  f  in  (3)  the  gamma-distribution  of  a  kind  (17)  [1]).  In  Fig.  1  it  is  shown  the
comparison  of  distribution  (4)  f(u)=exp{-βu2/2}[1+(q-1)βr0u2/2(1-r0)]-1/(q-1)/Z  (E=u2/2;  β=0,1;
r0=0,1; q=1,1) with distribution (23) from [1] p(u)=exp{-βu2/2}[1+(q-1)(1-exp{-βr0u2/2(1-r0)})]-
1/(q-1)/Z1,  with  Boltzmann-Gibbs  distribution  n(u)=exp{-βu2/2}/ZB  and  with  Tsallis  distribution
t(u)=[1+(q-1)βr0u2/2(1-r0)]-1/(q-1)/ZT. It is seen that the distributions f(u) from (4) and p(u) from
(23)  of  [1]  coincide  and  lie  between  the  Boltzmann-Gibbs  n(u)  and  Tsallis  distribution  t(u),
although their “tails” (1,339×10-10 for p(u) and 4,245×10-11 for f(u) at u=-20) have values below
the corresponding tail values of n(u) (6,917×10-10) and t(u) (5,916×10-3).

The behaviour of distribution (3), (4) essentially depends on values r0 (α0). At r0→ 0 (α0→
0, α0>0) the Gibbs distribution is obtained. At α→ 0 and γ→ 0 (19) [1]. As it is marked in the
beginning of Section 3 [1], it corresponds to transition to Gibbs distributions. Thus and λ→ 0,
but also α=γ/λ→ 0 also it is performed correlation (19) [1]. The value γ describes entropy fluxes
and entropy production in the system [14]; the value λ describes intensity of an input in system
(and an output from it).

2. Various models of superstatistics

Likewise for the discrete case [1] one can specify the expressions obtained. As f in (2)-(3)
one  can  choose  various  continuous  expressions,  for  example,  a  functional  gamma-distribution
with density of the form g(x)=λαβα[ln(1+x)]α-1exp{-λβln(1+x)}/Γ(α)(1+x) and parameters α, β,
λ.

As  in  [1]  one  can  use  the  superposition  of  the  characteristic  functions,  i.e.  one
characteristic  function  serves  as  an  argument  for  another:  ϕ(f(t)).  Multilevel  hierarchy
ϕ(f1(f2(…))) can be considered as well. Using in ϕ(f(t)) gamma-distributions and relations (4) for
both ϕ and f yields the distributions p(E) of the form:

p(E))∼exp{-βE}[1+(q-1)ln{1+(q1-1)β0r0E}/(q1-1)]-1/(q-1).                                           (6)
At  q1→1  we  get  the  expression  (4).  If  q→1  the  same  expression  (4)  is  recovered,  where  q  is
replaced by  q1.

For ϕ(f1(f2(t))) and using gamma-distributions with (4) for ϕ and f1, f2 one gets:

p(E))∼exp{-βE}[1+(q-1)ln{1+(q1-1)ln[1+(q2-1)β0r0E]/(q2-1)}/(q1-1)]-1/(q-1).            (7)
For logarithmic-normal distribution for the function f in (2)-(3) with density g(x)=exp{-

(lnx-µ)2/2b2}/xb(2π)1/2, x≥0, the characteristic function acquires the form:

ϕ(t)=1+∑

∞

=1k

(it)kexp{µk+k2b2/2}/k!,

and

p(E)∼exp{-βE}[1+∑

(-β0r0E)kexp{µk+k2b2/2}/k!].                                                 (8)

This  can  be  compared  to  Tsallis  distribution  (4)  obtained  out  of  gamma-distribution,  when
p(E)∼exp{-βE}[1+∑

(-β0r0E)k [(k-1)q-(k-2)]/k!].

Using as f in (2)-(3) the beta-distribution of the second kind with density g(x)=(a/b)αxα-
1/B(α,  c)(1+ax/b)α+c,  x≥0  (  α,  c,  a,  b  –  parameters  and  B(α,  c)  is  beta-function)  and  with
the  degenerated
characteristic 
hypergeometric function and Γ  is gamma-function, leads to the energy distribution of the form

function  ϕ(t)=Γ(α+c)Ψ(α,1-c;itb/a)/Γ(c),  where  Ψ 

is 

p(E)∼exp{-βE}Γ(α+c)Ψ(α, 1-c; -bβ0r0E/a)/Γ(c),                                                      (9)

latter  at  big  E  yields

(we  note  that  in  [5]  the  F-distribution  is  considered,  but  the  explicit  form  of  the  characteristic
function  is  unspecified,  hence  non  specified  is  the  closed  expression  for  p(E));  noncentral  F-

distribution,  Meykhem-distribution  etc.  The  combinations  of  the  degenerate  hypergeometric
functions  Ψ  contain  noncentered  Beta-distribution  of  the  second  kind  and  other  types  of
distributions.  Equally  many  other  characteristic  functions  contain  special  functions.  Thus
characteristic  function  of  the  standard  Beta-distribution  of  the  second  kind  contains  the
Whitteker  function;  the  characteristic  functions  of  the  logistic,  Nakagami-,  and    χ-distribution
contain the functions of the parabolic cylinder.

For the noncentered gamma-distribution with density g(x)=e-δg1(α, λ, x)0F1(α, δx/λ) (α>0,
λ>0,  δ≥0  are  parameters,    g1(α,  λ,  x)  the  density  of  gamma  (17)  of  [1]  provided  that  λ=1/bk,
α=αk,  pFq    is  the  generalized  hypergeometric  series)  the  characteristic  function  is  ϕ(t)=(1-itλ)-
αexp{itδλ/(1-itλ)}. It generalizes  the characteristic  function  of  gamma-distribution  and  contains
an extra parameter δ. If  α=1/(q-1), λ=(q-1)/(1+δ(q-1)) then

p(E)∼exp{-βE}[1+β0r0E(q-1)/(1+δ(q-1))]-1/(q-1)exp{-δ(q-1)β0r0E/[1+δ(q-1)+(q-1)β0r0E]}.

The  estimations  show  that  at  relatively  small  δ<0,9  and  for  the  values  of  parameters  r0=0,1;
β=0,1; q=1,1 (as on Fig. 1) this distribution differs slightly from (4) (see Fig. 1). It is possible to

In  conclusion  we  remark  that  besides  the  expressions  (6)-(13)  the  options  of  modelling
the explicit shapes of superstatistics are extremely vast, and their careful analysis, as well as their
suitability to various physical problems are grateful subjects of the future challenges.

3.  The  role  of  the  controlling  parameter  in  the  passage  from  superstatistics  to  Gibbs
distributions and in the evolution of a system

The distributions (3), (4) are widely encountered in various domains of physics. We trace
some examples with pointing out the role of the controlling parameters, which are included in the
parameter r0.

3 a)   Distributions for the systems with multiplicative noise.

In  [15]  a  family  of  the  statistical  models  with  multiplicative  noise  is  considered.
Microscopic dynamics, containing multiplicative noise, may be encountered in many dynamical
processes,  such  as  in  stochastic  resonance  [16],  noise  induced  phase  transitions  [17],  granular
packings  [18],  and  others  [19,  20]  processes  subject  to  both  additive  and  multiplicative  noises
and described by the dimensionless stochastic differential equation of the form

7

du/dt=h(u)+g(u)ξ(t)+η(t) ,                                                                                       (14)

where  u(t)  is  a  stochastic  variable,  h,  g  are  arbitrary  functions  (g(0)=0),  and  ξ(t),  η(t)  are
uncorrelated and Gaussian-distributed zero-mean white noises, hence satisfying

<ξ(t)ξ(t`)>=2Mδ(t-t`),   <η(t)η(t`)>=2Aδ(t-t`),                                                      (15)

where  M,  A>0  are  the  noise  amplitudes  and  stand  for  “multiplicative”  and  “additive”,
respectively.

The  Fokker-Planck  equation  for  the  probability  density  p(u,t),  associated  to  Eq.  (14)  in

the Stratonivich definition written in [15] as

∂tp=-∂u(h(u)p)+M∂u(g(u)∂u[g(u)p])+A∂uup .                                                            (16)

In [15] one considers various situations which as their partial cases lead to the distributions of the
nonextensive statistical mechanics. In [15] it was noted that no functional exists where from by
means  of  a  variation  procedure  the  distributions  of  the  kind  of  (3)-(4)  combining  Gibbs  and
nonextensive  statistical  mechanics,  could  be  derived.  However  in  [1]  the  distribution  (5)  ([1])
was  obtained  merely  from  a  variational  procedure;  further  the  distribution  (3)  was  obtained
therefrom under plausible assumptions. That is we got the distribution (3) in two steps: at first
the variation procedure yielded the distribution (5) of [1], and then using assumptions as to the
shape of the ω(Е,Γ) function and integrating over Γ we arrived at the distribution (3).

Under  the  zero  flux  boundary  conditions  (i.e.  such  that  j(-∞)=j(∞)=j(u)=0,  where
j(u)=J(u)p-∂u[D(u)p]  is  the  current,  J(u)=h(u)+Mg(u)g`(u);  D(u)=A+M[g(u)]2)  the  stationary
solution of (16) is written as

p(u)=C/η(u);    C=const;      η(u)=(Mg2+A)1/2exp{-∫h(u)du/(Mg2+A)}.                 (17)

If  we  assume  the  deterministic  drift  h(u)  and  g(u)  in  the  form  widely  used  in  synergetics  (for
example, [21]):

h(u)= αu-δu3;    g(u)=u,                                                                                            (18)

then from (17)-(18):

p(u)∼exp{-δu2/2M}/[1+Mu2/A][1-(α+δA/M)/M]/2 .                                                          (19)

Comparing (19) and (4), we get

E=u2/2;     δ/M=β=1/kBT;     1/(q-1)=[1-(α+δA/M)/M]/2;    (q-1)β0r0=M/A;

8

r0=1-δA/M(M-α)=1-βA/(M-α);   β0=β/(1-r0)=β+βq=(M-α)/A;  βq=β0r0=(M-α)/A-β=β0-β;
rf=r0/(1-r0)=(M-α)/βA-1=β0/β-1=βq/β.

From here it is clear that the relations (5) are satisfied, the sign of q-1, r0 depends on the
relation  between  α,  δ,  A,  M.  The  value    β0=β  at  α=M-βA.  The  value  q-1  has  a  singularity  at
1=(α+δA/M)/M,  changing  its  sign.  At  α=M  the  value    β0  turns  to  zero  and  the  value  r0  has
singular  behaviour.  From  hence  it  follows  that  the  value  of  the  controlling  parameter  α=M
corresponds to the bifurcation point. Besides the (18)-(19) one can name a number of different
examples of choosing functions h(u) and g(u) [15, 11]. As f in (3) not only gamma-distributions
(yielding Tsallis distribution (4)), but other possible classes of functions can be used.

3 b) Turbulence

In [22] a simple modification  of distribution, obtained in [23] for acceleration a of a tracer

particle by the turbulent flow, is suggested for the description of the turbulence:

p(a)=Cexp{-a2/ac

2}/[1+V0(q-1)a2/2]1/(q-1);    V0=4;  q=3/2,                                     (20)

where C is normalization constant, ac is a free parameter, which in [22] is used for a fitting. In
essence, this meant the redefinition β/2→a-2
c+β/2. The  numerical value ac=39,0 is obtained in
[22] by a direct fitting of the probability density function (20) to the experimental data. Direct
comparison of  (20) with (4) gives:

E=ac

2/2;     β=2/ac

2;     r0=(V0ac

2/4)/(1+V0ac

2/4);      β0=β/(1-r0)=2(1+V0ac

2/4)/ac

2=

β(1+V0ac

2/4)=β(1+V0/2β);       βq=β0r0=V0/2=2.                                                    (21)

Since in our case β≈1,3×10-3, then r0≈0,99934≈1;  β0≈2,0013≈V0/2=2;  rf=βq/β≈1538.

The  distribution  and  behaviour  of  this  system  is  closer  to  the  Tsallis  distribution

(consequently, to corresponding behaviour) than to Gibbs one.

3 c) Van der Pol generators

In [24] the Brownian motion in the autooscillating systems is considered on the example of
the Van der Pol generator. This generator contains the linear electric oscillating contour included
via  the  amplifier  into  the  feedback  unit.  In  [24]  the  situation  is  considered  which  is
characteristics  for  the  generation  process  in  a  number  of  cases  (for  example,  for  the  theory  of
solid body lasers), where the dissipative nonlinearity enters symmetrically the equations for the
charge  and  for  the  current  (or  coordinate  and  moment,  speaking  in  terms  of  the  mechanical
analogy). The stationary distributions for the corresponding kinetic equation in [24] are written
as

p0(E)=Cexp{-Heff(E,αf)/kBT}; Heff =E-(αf/δ)ln(1+δЕ/ν),                                         (22)

9

where E is energy, kBT=D/ν - effective temperature, D – noise intensity, α=αf -ν,  αf – feedback
coefficient,  ν  and  δ  are  coefficients  of  linear  and  nonlinear  friction;  ν(Е)=ν+δЕ,  and  the
the  form:  D(E)=
dependence  of 
the
terms  of 
in 
ν(Е)kBT/М=D(1+δЕ/ν);  D=νkBT,  here  М 
electromechanical analogy, we suppose M=1). We see that (22) coincides with (4) at

the  diffusion  coefficient  D(E)  on  energy  E  has 
the  mass  (inductivity 

is 

β=1/kBT;   1/(q-1)=-αf/δkBT;    (q-1)β0r0=δ/ν=αf/α;    r0=αf/(αf-ν);     β0=β(1-αf/ν);    (23)

βq=β0r0=-βαf/ν;      rf=βq/β=-αf/ν .

Let us consider the evolution of the system when the controlling parameter αf changes. At
αf<0,  r0>0,  rf>0,  βq>0,  β0>0,  q-1>0.  If  αf→0  the  value  q-1  undergoes  a  peculiarity,  and
likewise βq, rf, r0, changes its sign when the sign of αf changes. If αf -ν<0 the system tends to the
state of rest with Е=0, and rf=-αf/ν>-1, β0>0, βq>-β. At αf=ν the value r0 has peculiarity, and β0
becomes  zero.  The  value  αf=ν  corresponds  to  the  bifurcation  point.  At  αf-ν>0,    rf=-αf/ν<-1,
β0<0.  The  negative  effective  temperature  corresponds  to  the  selforganization,  like  in  self-
organized  criticality  (SOC)  [25].  Stationary  autooscillations  emerge  with  the  frequency  ω0  and
limit cycle energy Е=α/δ [24].

3 d)  The velocity distribution in the presence of the heat source

The same form as (22) is acquired by the stationary solution of the kinetic equation in the
presence of the heat source [24]. In [24] the following illustrative example is considered. Given
the thermostate with the predefined temperature T0 and provided with the heat source and sink.
Linear  coefficient  ν  (proportional  to  the  energy  E)  and  nonlinear  one  δ  of  the  heat  sink
characterize  the  latter.  The  heat  source  is  characterized  by  the  feedback  coefficient  af.  The
“friction” is represented as

The diffusion coefficient in the velocity space is nonlinear and given by the expression

ν(E)=ν-af+δE;   E=mv2/2; ν>0; δ>0.

D(v)(E)= ν(1+δE/ν)kBT/m.

Examining  the  dynamic  equation  for  the  energy  it  follows  that  the  zero  value  of  the
parameter a=af-ν is the bifurcation point - a<0 the stable solution E=0, and at a>0 the nonzero
solution  E=a/δ.  Transiting  through  the  bifurcation  point  a  nonequilibrium  phase  transition
occurs, and the structure of the distribution is changed. The controlling parameter is the feedback
parameter af. The stationary distribution equals to

p(v)=Cexp{-mv2/2kBT}[1+(δ/ν) mv2/2]

δTk
B

 .                                                 (24)

Comparing (4) with (25), we get:

β=1/kBT;     1/(q-1)=-af/δkBT;     (q-1)β0r0=δ/ν;     r0=af/(af-ν);      β0=β(1-af/ν);         (25)

βq=β0r0=-βaf/ν;          rf=βq/β=-af/ν .

10

The expressions (25) coincide with (23) after replacement of af to αf. This system exhibits
all  peculiarities  characteristics  for  the  Van  der  Pol  generator  if  one  takes  the  controlling
parameter af instead of αf.

3 e) Space diffusion of the Brownian particles in the external field

Besides the cases considered above the distributions (22), (24) suit for a number of other
phenomena.  So,  for  the  spatial  diffusion  in  the  external  field  [24]  F=-gradU(r),  if  the  elastic
2r2/2)(-a+br2/2), a=af-1, b>0. The
force becomes nonlinear and the potential is given U(r)=(Mω0
coefficient  af  characterizes  the  action  of  the  effective field,  for  example,  the  Lorentz  field  in  a
dielectric [26] (if its value is big enough, at a>0, the elasticity coefficient becomes negative, and
the  state  of  the  system  turns  out  to  bistable),  and  the  coefficient  b  is  determined  by  the
characteristics  of  the  medium.  The  diffusion  coefficient  depends  on  the  coordinates  as
D(r)(r)=D(r)(1+br2);  D(r)=kBT/Mν.  The  distribution  obtained  in  [24]  as  the  result  of  solving
Einstein-Smoluchovsky equation is:

p(r)=Cexp{-Ueff(r)/kBT};   Ueff(r)=(Mω0

2/2)[r2 –(af/b)ln(1+br2)].                           (26)

Here  an  effective  potential  Ueff  is  introduced  which  accounts  for  lowering  the  thermostat
symmetry when increasing the coefficient af. This changing can take place when changing both
density and temperature.

In  this  case  Е=(Mω0

2/2)r2;  β=1/kBT;  1/(q-1)=-(Mω0

2/2)(af/bkBT);  (q-1)β0r0(Mω0

2/2)=b;

r0=af/(af-1);  βq=β0r0=-βaf ;   rf=βq/β=-af.

The effective inverse temperature is β0=(1-af)/kBT=β(1-af).

The resemblance to the cases 3c), 3d) is evident. Compared to 3d) the value af/ν is replaced
by  af.  The  value  a=0,  af=1  corresponds  to  the  bifurcation  point.  The surrounding  provides  the
nonlinearity of the force acting upon a Brownian particle and, as it is marked in [24], one could
conventionally speak of the nonlinear thermostate. In [24] the difference in behaviour on the tails
(at  big  r)  is  noted  for  the  distribution  (26)  at  af≠0  and  af=0  (the  latter  coinciding  with  the
Boltzmann distribution for the Brownian motion of harmonic oscillators).

3 f) Maltus-Ferhuelst process

The Maltus-Ferhuelst process for modelling the populations (e.g. bacteria’s) with N members is
characterized by the death ν and birth α rates and extinction rate caused by interspecies struggle
δ(N-1).  In  [24]  the  general  stationary  solution  of  the  corresponding  Fokker-Planck  equation  is
given as

p0(N, α)=Cexp{-Heff(N,α)};  Heff=N-(α/δ)ln(1+δN/ν).

The  scaled  coefficient  T,  which  is  an  analogue  for  the  temperature,  is  taken  here  to  be

unity, T=1. Then

Е=N; β=1; 1/(q-1)=-α/δ;  (q-1)β0r0=δ/ν;  r0=α/(α-ν);  β0=1-α/ν;   βq=β0r0=-α/ν;   rf=βq=-α/ν.

11

The  relation  to  cases  3c),  3d)  is  markedly  seen.  In  [27]  the  connection  of  the  Maltus-
Ferhuelst  process  to  the  finiteness  of  the  lifetime  is  stressed  (the  population  dies  out  with
probability unity if the time is sufficiently long), and average lifetimes and survival probabilities
are  determined.  The Ω  -  decomposition  in  [27],  [28]  describes  the  evolution  on  smalles  time
scales because the (small) probability of the anomalously large fluctuation leading to extinction
n=0 is there neglected.

3 g) Van der Pol-Duffing system

In  [24]  a  Van  der  Pol-Duffing  system  is  considered,  that  is  the  Brownian  motion  in  a

generator with nonlinear frequency (subsection 3 c). Its effective Hamilton function is

Heff(x,v, αf, af)=(M/2)[v2-(αf/δ)ln(1+(δ/ν)v2)]+(Mω0

2/2)[x2-(af/b)ln(1+bx2)].             (27)

In this system the dissipative nonlinearity of the Van der Pol generator is combined with
the  nondissipative  nonlinearity  of  an  oscillator.  The  function  (27)  depends  on  two  control
parameters:  the  feedback  αf  and  field  efficiency  parameter  af.  If  both  controlling  parameters
equal  to  zero  the  effective  Hamiltonian  (27)  then  coincides  with  the  Hamilton  of  the  linear
oscillator (linear oscillating circuit in the generator)

Heff(x,v, αf=0, af=0)=(M/2)v2+(Mω0

2/2)x2=H0.

The  stationary  solution,  which  is  the  solution  of  the  corresponding  generalized  Fokker-

Planck equation,

is written as

We  assume  that  the  domains  and  variables  of  integration  are  separable,  and  conditions  hold  at

  This problem can be considered as an example of not only using the gamma- and Tsallis
distributions,  but  for  taking  advantages  of  the  superstatistics,  although  for  the  mere  product  of
gamma-distributions. The examples of this kind can be numerous.

Assuming  that β0=β01=β02;  r0=r01+r02,  one  gets:  r01=(αf/ν)/(αf/ν+af-1);  r02=af/(αf/ν+af-
1);  r0=(αf/ν+af)/(αf/ν+af-1);  β0=(1-af-αf/ν)/kBT;  βq1=β01r01=-αf/νkBT;  βq2=β02r02=-af/kBT;
βq=βq1+βq2=-β(af+αf/ν);   rf=-af-αf/ν.

At  nonzero  values  of  controlling αf,  af  the  relaxation  processes  in  a  system  exhibit  vast
variety  and  complexity.  In  [24]  two  groups  of  different  relaxation  times  are  introduced.  This
opens  wide  possibilities  of  statistical  description  of  mutual  influence  of  nonlinear  and
nondissipative processes. For example, the velocity distribution at nonzero feedback essentially
differs  from  the  equilibrium  one.  In  the  stationary  state  (28)  the  number  of  particles  with  big
velocities  can  essentially  exceed  the  equilibrium  value.  This  could  influence  strongly  the
transition rates of a Brownian particle in a bistable element. Thus we arrive back to the classical
Brownian  problem  of  reaching  boundary  time,  that  is  to  the  lifetime  question.  The  use  of  (28)
opens  new  possibility  of  changing  the  transition  rate  –  through  controlling  the  feedback
parameter  in  the  generator.  Changing  the  effective  field  the  another  parameter,  af  changes  as
well.  Thus  the  choose  of  some  optimizing  strategy  is  possible  by  changing  both  parameters  of
different  nonlinearity  types.  Besides  fluctuative  transition  between  wells  the  change  of  the
effective potential relief is also possible.

Besides  the  correlations  (19),  (20),  (22),  (24),  (26),  (28)  many  examples  of  distributions

which are reduced to expressions of a kind (3) - (4) can be deduced.

3. Physical examples of the application of the obtained distributions

We used distribution of a kind (4) for the description self-organized criticality (SOC) [29].
In work [30] formation of a stationary single avalanche and fluktuated formation of an avalanche
in  view  of  additive  noise  for  a  component  of  speed  and  an  inclination  of  sand  are  considered.
Thus distribution of the order parameter acquires a power-like form with an integer parameter.
But generally this parameter should be fractional, therefore in [30] generalization of system of
Lorentz  is  performed  allowing  to  account  for  the  behaviour  of  ensemble  of  avalanches.
Stochastic  systems  for  not  additive  ensemble  of  avalanches  are  used  also.  We  have  performed
calculation on distribution (4) with effective energy

β0E→ U(s)=ln[(IΣ+Iζsτ)/(1+sτ)2]+ ∫

[u-uτ/2/(1+uτ)][(1+uτ)2/(IΣ+Iζuτ)]du

from [30] for a case fluktuated formations of avalanches with an integer exponent of distribution
of  parameter  of  the  order τ=2  also  have  compared  behaviour  of  stationary  distribution  to  the
results received in [30] (Fig. 22 in [30]) for a case τ=1,5 in distribution exp{-U(s)}/Z. The results
are  shown  in  Fig.2.  Calculation  was  carried  out  for  the  same  values  of  parameters  noise
intensivity of energy IΣ   and  complexity  Iζ    which  are  used  in  [30].  Concurrence  of  the  results,

13

similar behaviour of distributions is evidenced. Parameters q, r0 only weakly influence behaviour
of distribution. We shall note, that using the pure Tsallis distribution leads to another behaviour
of  stationary  distribution  (in  particular,  does  not  show  indicated  in  [30]  distinctions  between
distributions with IΣ=1; Iζ=5 and IΣ=0,5; Iζ=30).

Comparison with the results obtained  [31, 32] for a spectrum of the cosmic ray was carried
~
out  as  well.  By  means  of  distribution  of  a  kind  p(E)=CE2(1+(q-1) β

flux rate of cosmic ray particles with a given energy is well fitted. If we use for these purposes
the distribution (4) multiplied with CE2 there is an additional parameter r0 (Fig.3). At values r0
close to 1 we get coincidence to results of [31]. At r0=1-10-14 the coincidence to results [31] is
exact.  At  r0=1-10-13  sharper  bend  is  obtained  at  ankle  energy  ∼  1019  eV;  the  plot  for  flux  rate
comes nearer to curve for parameters q=11/9, C=10-14 from [31] as well. Decreasing r0 we get
the  dependence,  characteristic  for  Boltzmann-Gibbs  distribution,  resulted  on  Fig.  1  in  [32].  At
values r0≈1 it is possible to explain conformity of experimental data in small volume of system
both high energy and temperatures. Comparison of calculations was carried out also by means of
expression  (4)  with  estimations  of  distributions  for  the  motion  of  point  defects  in  thermal
convection patterns in an inclined fluid layer [4], [33] which also has shown conformity with the
results received in [4], [33].

The same distributions (but in a discrete variant as in [1]) describe distribution on energy
of  density  of  neutrons  in  a  nuclear  reactor  [1],  and  in  a  continuous  variant  -  distribution  of
charges in the charged aerosols. In both these phenomena essential is the finiteness of a lifetime
of elements (neutrons and particles of an aerosol) in comparison with an environment (nucleus of
moderator for a reactor and molecules of air for aerosol particles).

3. Conclusion

In our work we have obtained the superstatistics in a way different from that of [5]. This
way is free from the shortcomings pointed out in [34]. Deriving (5) of [1] the notion of the slave
process  [35]  was  used  which  plays  part  for  the  derivation  of  superstatistics  as  well  [36].  The
distributions  (1-4)  are  products  of  the  Boltzmann  factor  and  the  superstatistics  factor.  The
Boltzmann factor causes them to behave as Gibbs distributions (Fig. 1) at 0<r0<1. However at
r0<0 (r0<0, for example, if γ<0) and r0>1 the distributions behave very differently. Thus these
distributions  present  a  possible  tool  for  phenomenological  description  of  the  bifurcations  and
phase transitions. The relations (14)-(29) demonstrate this using the examples of known systems.
Hereto  the  anomaly  diffusion  example  [37]  and a  number  of  other  phenomena  could  be  added
which are characterized by similar distributions.

The second factor of the distribution (4) contains an additional parameter r0 in comparison
to the Tsallis distribution; from the examples of Section 3 one can judge about the difference of
the suggested distribution from Tsallis one. So, for zero values of controlling parameter at which
the distribution should pass to Gibbs one, the value q-1 has peculiarity. The additional parameter
r0 allows for comparison of the distributions obtained with the results (17)-(28) and determining
explicit values of parameters. The general form (2) provides even more possibilities. Therefrom

14

the distributions (6)-(13) are obtained, and their applicability to various physical situations is to
be  elucidated.  The  second  factor  in  (3)  after  changing  β0r0→β0  passes  to  the  expression  for
superstatistics [5].  The suggested approach can be considered  as  broadening and detalizing the
superstatistics theory. Three characteristic temperatures are named: Gibbs temperature (8) of [1]
β=βGibbs=1/kBT=β0(1-r0); effective temperature β0 =βeff=β/(1-r0); and Tsallis temperature βq=βTs
=β0r0  =βr0/(1-r0);  the  relations  are  derived  between  them  and  the  parameters  r0,  rf: β0=β+βq;
rf=αP/u=β0/β -1=βq/β; r0=<αP/u>=(P0/u)α0=1-β/β0=βq/β0.

of  r0 is a function of βq. Thus it is possible to find a relation between parameters α or r0 and q.
In  [38]  one  more  interesting  question  on  a  form  of  the  differential  equations  for  y(x)=p(E)  is
considered. For distribution (4) this equation looks like dp(E)/dE=-β0(1-r0)p(E)-β0r0p(E)/[1+(q-
1)β0r0E]. It is possible to lead analogies to the equations, which have been written down in [38].
In the present work obvious expression for β`=β0(1-r0)+r1β01 is obtained, the physical sense of
distributions f1(β`) and f(αkβkvkPk/uk) is elucidated (besides distribution of return temperature), -
as density of distribution of probability of destruction in the certain time interval, on k-th stages.
It  is  possible  for  this  reason  gamma-distributions  f(x)=λαxα-1  exp{-λx}/Γ(α)  with  a  parameter
α=r/2  (is  more  true, χ2  distributions  with  r  degrees  of  freedom  which  corresponds  to  gamma-
distribution at λ=1/2-c; in [5] value r is interpreted as number of degrees of freedom giving the
contribution  in  fluktuating  value  β)  precisely  describe  Tsallis  statistics,  -  they  correspond  to
distribution of lifetime with r stages.

    
The  Gibbs  distribution  does  not  describe  the  dissipative  processes  that  develop  in  the
system. Superstatistics describe systems by constantly putting energy into the system, which is
dissipated.  The  value  α=γ/λ  is  related  to  dissipative  processes  in  the  system  (through  γ).  It
defines  a  correlation  between  Gibbs  and  superstatistics  multipliers  in  the  distribution  (3).
Similarly  in  [39]  the  new  interpretation  of  the  entropic  index  q  has  been  found.  In  [39]  it  has
been  shown that in q=(c+2)/(c+1) (as function of the negative-binomial distribution) parameter
c  is    related  to  the  number  of  random,  exponentially  distributed  contributions  to  the  effective
statistics  of  a  complex  system.  But  if  the  value  q  determines  Gibbs  contribution  to  the
superstatistics, the parameter  r0 is in its turn responsible for the relation between two factors in
(3).

It is possible not to pass to integrated relations, as in (3), having limited to summation (so,
as  discrete  analogue  of  gamma-distribution  negative  binomial  distribution  serves  [1]).  The
discrete description in many cases, for example, for bistability potential, appears more precisely
continuous.  The  found  conformity  between  superstatistics  and  the  nonequilibrium  distribution
containing lifetime, should appear useful to both cases. For example, many results established for
superstatistics  and  nonextensive  statistical  mechanics,  are  transferred  to  the  description  of
complex  systems  by  means  of  the  distribution  containing  lifetime.  Since  thermodynamics  with
lifetime  [40,41,42]  is  more  general,  than  the  theory  of  superstatistics  also  it  has  more
opportunities. Interesting is establishing the relation to a method of the nonequilibrium statistical
operator of Zubarev [2] generalizing Gibbs distributions which as it was marked, it is possible to
compare to the distributions containing lifetime, and nonextensive statistical mechanics [6-7], in
which entropy is represented by means of the measures which are distinct from Boltzmann and
Gibbs.  Probably,  they  stand  close  to  the  concept  of  lifetime,  in  the  latent  kind  present  in  both
theories. The relation γ=αλ (19) [1] is of interest also. The value γ thermodynamical conjugated
to  random  lifetime  is  expressed  through  entropy  production  and  currents  [14],  i.e.  through
15

communication  of  system  with  an  environment.  The  obtained  distribution  contains  the  new
parameter related to a thermodynamic state of the system, and also with distribution of a lifetime
of a metastable states and interaction of this states with an environment. Changing this parameter
it is possible to pass to Gibbs distribution.

Thus, an explicit account for the lifetime finiteness for a statistical system and the use of
the  lifetime  (first-passage  time)  as  a  thermodynamic  variable  brings  us  to  the  nonextensive
statistical mechanics. This fact is in a correspondence with known results about the finiteness of
the  size  for  systems  in  which  the  nonextensive  statistical  mechanics  can  be  applied  [43].
Furthermore  we  obtained  the    distribution  generalizing  the  Gibbs-Boltzmann  statistics  and
superstatistics. Real open systems seem to share the properties of both Gibbs and nonextensive
statistical  mechanics  types.    So  we  believe  bringing  forth  such  kinds  of  distributions  to  be  a
perspective point of view, which is likewise confirmed by the relevance of such distributions for
various phenomena. Depending on the value of r0 and on the controlling parameter the properties
of either nonextensive or extensive statistical mechanics prevail. The obtained relation (3) can be
regarded as the detalization (concretization) of the superstatistics theory [5]. For the expression
(3) one can write the entropy expression and corresponding thermodynamic relations as well.

Abstract

In this letter, we make a prima facie case that there could be distinct advan-
tages to exploiting a new class of ﬁnite ﬂux equilibrium solutions of the Quantum
Boltzmann equation in semiconductor lasers.

1 Introduction

At ﬁrst sight, it may very well seem that the two subjects linked in the title have
little in common. What do semiconductor lasers have to do with behavior normally
associated with fully developed hydrodynamic turbulence? In order to make the
connection, we begin by reviewing the salient features of semiconductor lasers. In
many ways, they are like two level lasers in that the coherent light output is asso-
ciated with the in phase transitions of an electron from a higher to lower energy
state. In semiconductors, the lower energy state is the valence band from which sea
electrons are removed leaving behind positively charged holes. The higher energy
state is the conduction band. The quantum of energy released corresponds to an
excited electron in the conduction band combining with a hole in the lower band
below the bandgap. Bandgaps, or forbidden energy zones are features of the energy
spectrum of an electron in periodic potentials introduced in this case by the periodic
nature of the semiconductor lattice.

However, there are two important ways in which the semiconductor laser diﬀers
from and is more complicated than the traditional two-level laser model. First, there
is a continuum of bandgaps parameterized by the electron momentum k and the

1

laser output is a weighted sum of contributions from polarizations corresponding
to electron-hole pairs at each momentum value. In this feature, the semiconduc-
tor laser resembles an inhomogeneosly broadened two level laser. Second, electrons
and holes interact with each other via Coulomb forces. Although this interaction is
screened by the presence of many electrons and holes, it is nonetheless suﬃciently
strong to lead to a nonlinear coupling between electrons and holes at diﬀerent mo-
menta. The net eﬀect of these collisions is a redistribution of carriers (the common
name for both electrons and holes) across the momentum spectrum. In fact it is the
fastest (≈ 100 fs.) process (for electric ﬁeld pulses of duration greater than picosec-
onds) and because of this, the gas of carriers essentially relaxes to a distribution
corresponding to an equilibrium of this collision process. This equilibrium state is
commonly taken to be that of thermodynamic equilibrium for fermion gases, the
Fermi-Dirac distribution characterized by two parameters, the chemical potential µ
and temperature T , slightly modiﬁed by the presence of broadband pumping and
damping.

But the Fermi-Dirac distribution is not the only equilibrium of the collision
process. There are other stationary solutions, called ﬁnite ﬂux equilibria, for which
there is a ﬁnite and constant ﬂux of carriers and energy across a given spectral
window. The Fermi-Dirac solution has zero ﬂux of both quantities. It is the aim of
this letter to suggest that these ﬁnite ﬂux equilibria are more relevant to situations
in which energy and carriers are added in one region of the spectrum, redistributed
via collision processes to another region where they are absorbed. Moreover, it
may be advantageous to pump the laser in this way because such a strategy may
partially overcome the deleterious eﬀects of Pauli blocking. The Pauli exclusion
principle means that two electrons with the same energy and spin cannot occupy the
same state at a given momentum. This leads to ineﬃciency because the pumping
is eﬀectively multiplied by a factor (1 − ns(k)), s = e, h for electrons and holes
respectively, denoting the probability of not ﬁnding electron (hole) in a certain k
(used to denote both momentum and spin) state. But, near the momentum value
corresponding to the lasing frequency ωL, ns(k) is large (ne(k) + nh(k) must exceed
unity) and Pauli blocking signiﬁcant. Therefore, pumping the laser in a window
about ω0 > ωL in such a way that one balances the savings gained by lessening
the Pauli blocking (because the carriers density ns(k) decreases with k = |k|) with
the extra input energy required (because k is larger), and then using the ﬁnite
ﬂux solution to transport carriers (and energy) back to lasing frequency, seems
an option worth considering. The aim of this letter is to demonstrate, using the
simplest possible model, that this alternative is viable. More detailed results using
more sophisticated (but far more complicated) models will be given later.

These ﬁnite ﬂux equilibria are the analogies of the Kolmogorov spectra associ-

2

ated with fully developed, high Reynolds number hydrodynamic turbulence and the
wave turbulence of surface gravity waves on the sea. In the former context, energy
is essentially added at large scales (by stirring or some instability mechanism), is
dissipated at small (Kolmogorov and smaller) scales of the order of less than the
inverse three quarter power of the Reynolds number. It cascades via nonlinear inter-
actions from the large scales to the small scales through a window of transparency
(the inertial range in which neither forcing nor damping is important) by the con-
stant energy ﬂux Kolmogorov solution. Indeed, for hydrodynamic turbulence, the
analogue to the Fermi-Dirac distribution, the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum of equipati-
tions, is irrelevant altogether. The weak turbulence of surface gravity waves is the
classical analogue of the case of weakly interacting fermions. The mechanism for
energy and carrier density (particle number) transfer is ”energy” and ”momentum”
conserving binary collisions satisfying the ”four wave resonance” conditions

k + k1 = k2 + k3,

ω(k) + ω(k1) = ω(k2) + ω(k3).

(1)

In the semiconductor context, ¯hω(k) = ¯hωgap + ǫe(k) + ǫh(k) (which can be well
approximated by α+βk2) where ¯hωgap = ǫgap corresponds to the minimum bandgap
and ǫe(k), ǫh(k) are electron and hole energies. In each case, there is also a simple
relation E(k) = ωn(k) between the spectral energy density E(k) and carrier (par-
ticle number) density n(k). As a consequence of conservation of both energy and
carriers, it can be argued (schematically shown in Figure 1 and described in its cap-
tion), that the ﬂux energy (and some carriers) from intermediate momentum scales
(around k0 say) at which it is injected, to higher momenta (where it is converted
into heat) must be accompanied by the ﬂux of carriers and some energy from k0 to
lower momenta at which it will be absorbed by the laser. It is the latter solution
that we plan to exploit.

2 Model

We present the results of a numerical simulation of a greatly simpliﬁed model of
semiconductor lasing in which we use parameter values which are realistic but make
fairly severe approximations in which we (a) assume that the densities of electrons
and holes are the same (even though their masses diﬀer considerably) (b) ignore
carrier recombination losses and (c) model the collision integral by a diﬀerential
approximation [1], [2], [3] in which the principal contributions to wavevector quartets
satisfying (1) are assumed to come from nearby neighbors. Despite the brutality
of the approximations, the results we obtain are qualitatively similar to what we
obtain using more sophisticated and complicated descriptions.

3 Results

We show the results in ﬁgures 2, 3, and 4. First, to test accuracy, we show, in Figure
2, the relaxation of (6) to a pure Fermi-Dirac spectrum in the window ωL = 1 < ω <
ω0 = 2. The boundary conditions correspond to P = Q = 0 at both ends. We then
modify boundary conditions to read Q = Q0 > 0 and P = 0 at both ends. Next,
in Figure 3 and 4, we show the results of two experiments in which we compare the
eﬃciencies of two experiments in which we arrange to (i) pump broadly so that the
eﬀective carrier distribution equilibrium has zero ﬂux and (ii) pump carriers and
energy into a narrow band of frequencies about ω0 and simulate this by specifying
carrier and energy ﬂux rates QL and PL = −ωLQL (PL chosen so that the energy
absorbed by the laser is consistent with the number of carriers absorbed there) at
the boundary ω = ω0. ω = ωL is the frequency at which the system lases.

In both cases, the rate of addition of carriers and energy is (approximately)
the same. The results support the idea that it is worth exploring the exploitation
of the ﬁnite ﬂux equilibrium. The carrier density of the equilibrium solutions at
ω0 is small thus making pumping more eﬃcient there. The output of the laser is
greater by a factor of 10. While we do not claim that, when all eﬀects are taken
account of, this advantage will necessary remain, we do suggest that the strategy of
using ﬁnite ﬂux equilibrium solutions of the Quantum Boltzmann equation is worth
further exploration.

• Figure 1

Carriers and energy are added at ω0 at rates Q0 and ω0Q0. Energy and some
carriers are dissipated at ωR > ω0 (an idealization) and carriers and some
energy are absorbed by the laser at ωL. (The carriers number will build until
the laser switches on.) A little calculation shows QL = Q0(ωR − ω0)/(ωR −
ωL), QR = Q0(ωL − ω0)/(ωR − ωL), PR = Q0ωR(ω0 − ωL)/(ωR − ωL), PL =
ωLQ0(ω0 − ωR)/(ωR − ωL). Finite ﬂux stationary solutions are realized in the
windows (ωL, ω0) and (ω0, ωR) although in practice there will be some losses
through both these regions.

• Figure 2.

To test accuracy we take some initial distribution function (thin line) and plot
its time evolution as described by (6) with boundary conditions P = Q = 0
at both ends. The distribution function relaxes to Fermi-Dirac state (thick
line). Several intermediate states is shown by long-dashed and short-dashed
lines (Figure 2a). We then modify boundary conditions to P = 0, Q = Q0 > 0
at both ends. Then initial distribution function (thick line) relaxes to ﬁnite-Q-
equilibria as shown by long-dashed line. We then change boundary conditions
to P = 0, Q = Q1 > Q0 at both ends, so that distribution function is shown
by short-dashed line. Increasing Q at boundaries even further, so that P =
0, Q = Q2 > Q1 at both ends, the distribution function is given by dotted line
(Figure 2b).

We now solve (2-4) with the collision term given by (6). We pump broadly,
so that the eﬀective carrier distribution has zero ﬂux. The initial distribution
function (thin line) builds up because of a global pumping (dashed lines), until
the laser switches on. The ﬁnal (steady) distribution function is shown by thick
solid line (Figure 3a). The output power (in arbitrary units) as a function of
time (measured in relaxation times ≃ 100fs) is also shown (Figure 3b).

• Figure 3.

• Figure 4.

We pump in the narrow region around ω0 ≃ 200meV and we model this by
specifying carrier and energy ﬂux rates QL and PL = −ωLQL. The initial
distribution function (thin line) builds up because of inﬂux of particles and
energy from right boundary (dashed lines), until the laser switches on. The
ﬁnal (steady) distribution function is shown by thick solid line and corresponds
to a ﬂux of particles and energy from right boundary (where we add particles
and energy) to the left boundary, where the system lases (Figure 4a). The

output power as a function of time is also shown (Figure 4b).

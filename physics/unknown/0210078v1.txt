Abstract : The constraint equations for the novel scaled boundary finite element method 

in electromagnetics to prevent the spurious modes in the eigen solution, is derived from 

the Maxwell’s divergence equation for the magnetic field and by combining it with the 

scaled boundary transformation of the geometry. 

 
Key words : Scaled boundary finite element method, spurious modes  
 
Introduction  :    The  scaled  boundary  finite  element  method  is  a  novel  finite  element 

method,  and  its  theory  has  been  recently  extended  to  electromagnetics  [1].  This  scaled 

boundary  finite  element  approach  ,  was  initially  developed  by  Chongmin  Song  and  

John.P.Wolf  [2-14]  to  successfully  solve  elastodynamic  and  allied  problems  in  civil 

engineering.        The  advantages  of  this  novel  finite  element  method  has  already  been 

described in detail [1-14].  

One  of  the  crucial  aspects  to  be  taken  care  during  the  application  of  the  finite 

element  methods  for  analysis  is  the  occurrence  of  the  spurious  modes  in  the  finite 

element eigen value equation. In electromagnetics, it has been found that the occurrence 

of these modes is due to the inadequate modeling of the zero divergence of the magnetic 

field [15] . Among the various approaches suggested to avoid these modes in computation, 

it  has  been  established  that  the  use  of  the  tangentially  continuous  vector  finite  element 

method greatly reduces the occurrence of these modes [15] .

In  this  situation,  it  is  imperative  to  derive  the  conditions  for  the  scaled  boundary  finite 

element method, so that spurious modes do not occur in the solution.   

 
Theory : Derivation of the constraint equations : 
 
The Maxwell’s divergence equation for the magnetic field is given by, 
 
Div B = 0                                                                     (1) 
 
For the case where µr=1 the above equation can be written as, 
 
Div H =0                                                                      (2)

number  of  unknown  coefficients  in  the  double  summation  series  for  every  single 

component  of  H  is  chosen  to  be  equal  to  the  number  of  unknown  coefficients  in  the

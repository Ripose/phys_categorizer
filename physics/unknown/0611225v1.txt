Abstract: In the paper we present the results of mathematical modeling of the registration 

efficiency of thermal neutrons for the converters made of natural Gd and its 157 isotope 

plane-parallel foils. In the performed calculations four fixed energies of neutrons with the 

corresponding wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 A0 are taken into account. We calculate the 

efficiencies  of 

the  converter 

for  electron  escapes 

to 

frontward  and  backward 

hemispheres  and  their  sum,  depending  on  thickness  of  converting  foils.  Results  of 

comparison of our calculations with the experimental data are presented.

1.  Introduction  
 
Converters  of  neutron  radiation  play  the  crucial  role  during  development  of  detectors 

because  they  determine  the  basic  characteristics  of  detectors,  i.e.  –  the  efficiency  of 

registration, as well as both energetic and spatial resolution of the detector. 

Gase-filled  and  solid-state  converters  of  slow  neutrons  are  widely  used  now.  Several 

types of nuclear reactions are used in these converters. The most well-known among them are 

3He and 10BF3 converters. It should be mentioned that gas-filled converters are used in the wide 

class of gas-filled detectors [1],[2],[3]. Solid-state converters are used in gas-filled as well as in 

both scintillation and semiconductor detectors. But solid-state converters are rarely used in the 

detectors  of  neutrons;  this  is  related  first  of  all  to  their  low  efficiency  of  registration.  Thus,  the 

registration efficiency of detectors based on 10В and 6Li as usual does not exceed 3-4 % and 1 

%, respectively (see [1], [4]).  

Among the solid-state converters of thermal neutrons, the highest registration efficiency 

up  to  30  %  is  received  using  converters  on  the  basis  of  gadolinium  and  especially  its  157 

isotope [5], [6]. In the paper [7] simulation of the registration efficiency of thermal neutrons by 

the gadolinium foil converters was performed. The following conditions were considered in this 

simulation:  neutron  flux  (with  2  fixed  energies)  perpendicularly  fell  on  to  the  surface  of  the 

converting  foil  of  various  thicknesses;  the  secondary  electron  escapes  to  the  frontward  and 

backward  hemispheres  were  calculated.  As  a  result,  the  detector  on  the  basis  of  multi-wire 

proportional  chamber  with  gadolinium  converter  has  been  developed.  However,  this  kind  of 

detector  does  not  possess  well  enough  spatial  resolution;  it  is  just  about  10  mm.  In  order  to 

improve  the  spatial  resolution  the  same  authors  suggested  to  use  the  converter-collimator, 

which  was  a  sandwich  of  alternating  lead  foils  interlaid  by  glass  textolite  with  holes  drilled  in 

them by fine steps. This converter was pressed against a gadolinium foil and thus it limited the 

electron tracks in gas, simultaneously serving as an emitter of secondary electrons. It helped to 

improve  the  spatial  resolution  up  to  2  mm,  but  the  spatial  resolution  has  turned  out  to  be 

modulated by the step of apertures, moreover the efficiency of registration has sharply fallen [8]. 

Further,  during  the  development  of  multi-step  avalanche  chambers  with  the  gadolinium 

converters  the  spatial  resolution  of  detectors  was  improved  significantly  (up  to  1  mm)  without 

using Jeavons converter [9]. 

Recently  many  authors  were  engaged  in  the  development  of  detectors  on  the  basis  of 

gadolinium  converters  [10],[11],[12],[13],[14],[15],[16].  Simulations  of  the  registration  efficiency 

of thermal neutrons are also performed [17],[18],[19]. This fact testifies a significant interest to 

the gadolinium converters. 

It is worth to mention that modeling of the processes of neutron capture by gadolinium 

nuclei recently found it application also in beam therapy in order to decrease dozes of radiation 

received by oncological patients during their treatment. Recently, since 2000, the new direction 

in oncology and treatment of cancer tumors has started to develop, which is called gadolinium 

neutron  capture  therapy  (GdNCT)  [20].  The  method  is  based  on  the  injection  of  gadolinium 

nuclei  to  the  organism  of  patient  in  the  composition  of  medicinal  products  and  their  selective 

absorption  by  the  malignant  tumor  cells.  Thus  gadolinium  nuclei,  which  have  an  extraordinary 

high  section  of  interaction  with  thermal  neutrons,  allow  to  localize  influence  of  radiation  in  the 

area  of  cancer  cells.  Therefore  the  basic  radiation  exposure  is  provided  by  both  low-energy 

internal conversion electrons and Auger electrons.  

In our previous calculations of the registration efficiency of Gd-based detectors [17] we 

used data on internal conversion coefficients from the paper [21]. There are more precise new 

data  now  [22].  Analysis  of  these  data  had  shown  that  we  could  improve  our  calculations  and 

obtain more accurate results. This fact stimulated us to perform new calculations.   

In this work we will carry out model calculation of the efficiency of registration of thermal 

neutrons  by  the  foil  converters  made  of  natural  gadolinium  and  its  157  isotope.  Also  we 

compare our obtained modeling data with the experimental results.  

 

2. Physical basis and model approximation 

 

In the process of the capture of thermal neutrons by gadolinium nuclei, in addition to the 

radioactive  γ-quanta,  here  both  internal  conversion  electrons  and  Auger  electrons  are  being 

emitted.  These  are  the  electrons  that  are  mainly  registered  by  the  position sensitive  detectors 

and especially by the gas-filled ones, which have low γ-quanta registration efficiency. Therefore, 

in our calculations, we take into account only those electrons, which arise as a result of neutron 

conversion on gadolinium nuclei. 

As it is well-known, natural gadolinium is a mixture of isotopes that could participate in 

the (n, γ) nuclear reaction. Table 1 summarizes the main characters of Gd isotopes, including 

their  cross sections  of interactions with  neutrons,  daughter isotopes  and  half-decay  periods  of 

unstable daughter isotopes [23].

As one can see in this table, the most interesting for our calculations are natural Gd and 

its  155  and  157  isotopes,  which  have  abnormally  high  cross  sections  of  interaction  with 

neutrons. Other isotopes give an insignificant contribution to the interaction with neutrons.  

In this paper we will consider natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope only. 

In the reaction of 157Gd neutron capture, 7937.33 keV energy is emitted. In total 390 lines 

with energy ranges from 79.5 up to 7857.670 keV with line intensity of 2*10-3 up to 139 gamma-

quanta on 100 captured neutrons are emitted. In the Table 2 the most intensive, low - energy 

gamma-lines  having  high  coefficient  of  internal  conversion  are  presented.  In  the  fig.  1  the 

histogram showing dependence of gamma quantum intensity on the energy is presented [24].

Since, there are low-energy gamma quanta in the spectrum, thus during their emission the 

probability of an electron irradiation from the atom shell (electrons of internal conversion) is very 

high. Nucleus eliminates its excitation by the irradiation of gamma-quantum, but it also can emit 

the close located electrons. As usual the K-electron (electron from the K-shell) is emitted, but an 

electron from the higher shell (like L, M, N and so on) also could be emitted. Created electron 

vacancy  (the  electron  hole)  is  filled  by  another  electron  from  the  higher  level.  This  process  is 

accompanied by X-ray irradiation, or by the irradiation of Auger electron. 

The effect of internal conversion is accompanied by the significant X-ray radiation, which 

could  positively  affect  on  the  use  of  scintillation  detectors  with  the  fine-dispersed  gadolinium. 

We will only consider electrons with the energies higher than 20 keV. 

Data on coefficients of internal conversion are different in various sources [21] that lead to 

the divergences in quantity of the secondary electrons. In our last modeling, we based on the 

last data presented in the database [22]. 

In  the  Table  3  the  most  intensive  lines  of  electrons  are  given,  whose  probability  of 

emission exceeds 0.03/100 neutrons, for the energies of primary gamma quantum less than 1 

МeV. Data on Auger electrons which are formed during the K-shell filling are presented as well. 

The maximum number of formed vacancies on K-shell (electron holes) does not exceed 45.2 to 

100 falling neutrons.

In  our  calculations,  totally  444  discrete  electron  energies  with  the  output  probability  of 

more than 10-5 on 100 falling neutrons were considered. On fig. 2 the histogram is presented, 

which shows the dependence of the most intensive lines of electron intensity on their energy.   

The  most  important  characteristic  of  converter  is  the  probability  of  secondary  electron 

output, emitted during the irradiative capture of neutrons by the substance of converter. Since, 

generally,  electrons  have  low  energies  and  small  paths  in  the  substance  of  converter  it  puts 

forward the additional requirements to the thickness of the converter. 

The  absorption  coefficient 

characterizes  probability  of  absorption  of  electrons  in  the

substance.  If  Х  is  thickness  of  the  converter,  Re  is  an  electron  path  in  the  substance  of 

converter, then

Fig.  4 depicts the dependence of cross-section (barn) on the energy of incident neutrons 

(eV), for natural gadolinium and the same dependence for its 157 isotope [26]. Arrows indicate 

energy  of  neutrons  for  which  we  will  carry  out  our  calculations.  As  one  can  see,  with  the 

reduction of energy of neutrons the cross-section of interaction strongly increases. Especially it 

increases in the region of cold and ultra cold neutrons.  

Modeling was realized by examining the simplest targets, namely the plane-parallel foils. 

The  calculations  for  thermal  neutrons  with  the  fixed  energies,  which  correspond  to  neutron 

wavelength  of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 A0 were carried out; also both the thickness of converters from 1 

µm to 40 µm, and isotopic composition of converter (for natural Gd and 157Gd) were varied. 

In the calculation all electrons (appeared as a result of neutron capture act) are taken into 

account  which  are  able to  escape  an  infinite  plane-parallel plate  of  the converter.  The  ratio  of 

the number of electrons escaped from the foil to that of the incident ones is referred to as the 

efficiency of the converter. 

Conventionally we divide a foil into more thin layers. For each elementary layer we count 

the probability of absorption of neutrons with the fixed energy. Efficiency of the converter will be 

determined  by  the  sum  of  probabilities  of  neutron  absorption  and  probability  of  the  electron 

escape from the converter. In order to calculate the electron escape we have chosen a simple 

geometrical  model.  The  choice  of  the  model  is  made  from  the  following  assumptions:  all 

electron  emissions  are  isotropic,  the  length  of  path  for  any  fixed  energy  of  electrons  (Rei)  is 

constant  (fluctuation  of  power  losses  in  the  end  of  path  is  neglected).  Then  the  density  of 

probability to find electrons in the substance forms a sphere with the radius equal to Rei (for any 

fixed energy). If the center of the sphere is crossed by the plane, two identical hemispheres are 

formed, which correspond to the electron escape to the forward and backward hemisphere, thus 

the  area  of  hemispheres  could  be  considered  as  the  probability  of  an  electron  output.  In  this 

case total probability is 100 %, and escape to the one of hemispheres is 50 %. If we begin to 

cross  a  sphere  with  a  step  much  less  than  Rei,  segments  will  be  formed  whose  area  will  be 

equal to the probability of electron escape. The step of iterations should be at least 100 times 

less than Rei, and then the electron absorption under the big corners could be neglected. The 

area of a segment and therefore the probability of electron escape becomes equal to zero in the 

intersection  of  a  sphere  by  the  plane  at  the  distance  Rei.  The  sum  of  probabilities  of  electron 

escapes  for  all  energies,  taking  into  account  their  weight  contributions  will  determine  the  total 

electron escape probability. 

In  our  calculations,  the  probability  of  neutron  absorption  for  each  elementary  layer,  as  a 

result of reaction of inelastic interaction (n,γ), is determined, using database for fixed neutron 

energies. Both the probability of electron emission and probability of their escape from the body 

of the converter were calculated as well. 

Results of calculations of neutron absorption in converters made from natural gadolinium 

and its 157 isotope are shown in Fig. 5. Figure shows that at 30 microns thickness of the natural 

gadolinium converter there takes place a full absorption of neutrons with the wave length  f  1.8 

АО.  For  its  157  isotope  for  neutrons  with  the  wave  lengths 

  1.8  А

О  the  same  absorption 

f

happens at 8 microns thickness of the converter. 

In order to detect cold neutrons by the 157Gd converters we could limit ourselves by the 

thickness of 10 microns of the converter, if there no technological restrictions. It should be taken 

into account that ranges of the majority of electrons emitted in the reaction of radiating capture 

of neutrons do not exceed 5 microns. If we use natural gadolinium converter the situation is little 

bit more complex, since low absorbing ability results in the necessity to use of more thick (up to 

20-40 micron) converters.

Fig.  6  and  7  shows  the  dependence  of  registration  efficiency  on  converter  thickness  for 

neutrons with the different energies.  

Our obtained results of calculations are compared with the experimental data presented in 

paper  [18].  In  this  paper  experimental  data  on  the  detection  efficiency  was  measured  in 

backward  direction  for  six  different  energies  and  compared  to  a  calibrated  3He  counter. 

Enriched  up  to  90.5%  157Gd  converter  was  used.  Works  were  performed  in  the  reactors  of 

Atominstitut in Vienna (ATI) and the ILL Grenoble. 

The  results  of  comparison  are  shown  in  the  Fig.  8.  For  natural  gadolinium  our  results 

coincide with the experimental data well enough, in the limits of errors. Errors of calculations are 

caused  both  by  the  precision  of  determining  of  gamma-quanta  output  (see  Table  2)  and  by 

determining  of  neutron  cross-section.  This  good  consent  testifies  the  correct  choice  of  our 

models and performed calculations.  

For the converter made of 157 isotope of Gd the experimental curve lays little bit higher. 

Our  data  are  in  good  agreement  with  the  theoretical  limit,  determined  by  the  coefficients  of 

internal conversion, which makes no more than 65 % for an isotropic electron escapes, i.e. no 

more  than  32.5  %  for  the  escape  to  one  of  hemispheres.  If  we  take  into  account  Auger 

electrons,  which  could  also  escape  in  other  directions  with  respect  to  internal  conversion 

electrons, the efficiency of the converter, could be improved by 4%, i.e. theoretical limit is 36.5 

% for the electron escapes to the backward direction.  

 

 

 

3. Conclusion. 

 

Model  calculations  of  the  efficiency  of  registration  of  thermal  neutrons  by  foil  converters 

made of natural gadolinium and its 157 isotope are carried out. Processes of neutron absorption 

in the substance of converter and the probability of secondary electron escapes were examined. 

Calculations  are  performed  for  converters  with  the  various  thicknesses.  We  have  chosen  the 

most  optimal  converter  thicknesses,  both  from  natural  gadolinium  and  its  157  isotope.  While 

using converters from natural gadolinium it is possible to obtain total effectiveness of 18, 32, 38, 

42%, respectively for the neutrons with the wavelengths of 1, 1.8, 3 and 4 A0 for the converter 

thickness of 22, 12, 9, 8 microns. For the converters made of 157 isotope it is possible to reach 

total effectiveness of registration up to 40, 57, 61, 63% for the neutrons with the wavelengths 1, 

1.8, 3 and 4 A0 with the thickness of converter 8, 4, 3, 2 microns.  Obtained results of calculation 

are compared with the experimental data. Our data for natural gadolinium in the limits of errors 

coincide with the experimental [18] data, which testifies the correctness of chosen models and 

algorithms  of  calculations.  For  the  converters  made  of  157Gd  our  data  are  little  bit  lower,  but 

nevertheless they do not exceed the maximal possible values.   

This  work  has  been  accomplished  under  the  Project  T-1157  of  the  International  Science 

and Technology Center.

Abstract 
The design and operation of a differential Polymer Electrolyte Membrane (PEM) fuel cell 
is described.  The fuel cell design is based on coupled Stirred Tank Reactors (STR); the 
gas phase in each reactor compartment was well mixed.  The characteristic times for 
reactant flow, gas phase diffusion and reaction were chosen so that the gas compositions 
at both the anode and cathode are uniform.  The STR PEM fuel cell is one-dimensional; 
the only spatial gradients are transverse to the membrane.  The STR PEM fuel cell was 
employed to exa mine fuel cell start- up, and its dynamic responses to changes in load, 
temperature and reactant flow rates.  Multiple time scales in systems response are found 
to correspond to water absorption by the membrane, water transport through the 
membrane and stress-related mechanical changes of the membrane.

Fuel cells are multiphase chemical reactors where two sequential chemical

reactions are coupled by transport of the intermediate products between catalysts.  The 
reactants are fed to two sides of the reactor, separated by an ion-conducting barrier.  A 
catalytic reaction occurs on one side of the barrier producing an intermediate product that 
is transported across the barrier to a second catalyst where it reacts with the second 
reactant to make the final product.  A simplified version of the Polymer Electrolyte 
Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cell is shown in Figure 1.(Bokris and Srinivasan 1969; Blomen 
and Mugerwa 1993; EG&G Services 2000; Costamagna and Srinivasan 2001)  Hydrogen 
molecules are fed to the anode side of a cation conducting polymer membrane in contact 
with a catalyst.  The hydrogen molecules react on the anode catalyst producing the 
intermediate product – protons and electrons.  The protons are transported across the 
PEM and the electrons pass through an external circuit where they encounter oxygen 
molecules on the cathode side of the membrane.  The protons, electrons and oxygen react 
on the cathode catalyst surface and make water.

dissociatively adsorb at the anode 
and are oxidized to protons.  
Electrons travel through an external 
load resistance.  Protons diffuse 
through the PEM under an 
electrochemical gradient to the 
cathode.  Oxygen molecules adsorb 
at the cathode, are reduced and react 
with the protons to produce water.  
The product water is absorbed into 
the PEM, or evaporates into the gas 
streams at the anode and cathode. 

We introduce here a reaction engineering approach to analyze PEM fuel cells.   

 
 
Chemical Reaction Engineering  is the branch of engineering science that analyzes 
reaction and transport processes; this is done on scales ranging from the macroscopic 
process scale to the molecular scale.  Engineers employ various chemical reactor designs 
to study reaction and transport phenomena in reacting systems.  Stirred tank reactors are 
operated as differential reactors to obtain reaction kinetics.  Plug flow reactors provide 
information about the coupling of reaction kinetics with convective transport.  Two-
dimensional reactors permit the engineer to obtain information about diffusion of heat 
and mass in reacting systems.  These model reactors are not optimal for reactant 
conversion, but are specifically designed to measure system parameters, including 
effective kinetic and transport properties.(Froment and Bischoff 1979; Levenspiel 1996; 
Folger 1999)   
 
The design engineer relates reactor performance to the system parameters, using 
the best available correlations between the system parameters and the system variables.  
The reaction rate is correlated with the reactant concentrations, catalyst loading, 
temperature, pressure, etc.  Heat and mass transfer are correlated with temperature,

The mechanistic details of the elementary reaction steps and transport processes

between the system’s parameters and variables are the key elements of reaction 
engineering.  Although a molecular- level knowledge of the reaction and transport 
processes helps develop new catalysts and build mathematical correlations the molecular 
details are not essential to effectively model a reactor’s performance.  The mathematical 
correlations provide the correct level of information to assess the performance of 
different reactor configurations and design control systems.  A common joke is that 
chemical engineers design chemical reactors without ever knowing what the chemical

previous efforts to measure and model fuel cell performance.  We are seeking a 
prescriptive model of the PEM fuel cell, which describes the system response as a 
function of the parameters that the operator can control.  We employ an experimental 
approach based on experience with heterogeneous catalytic reactors; reactor performance 
for ammonia synthesis, petroleum cracking and reforming, nitric acid synthesis and many 
other chemical processes have been very successfully modeled knowing only empirical 
correlations for rate expressions and transport processes.(Froment and Bischoff 1979)  
Experimental results from simplified experimental reactors were employed to develop 
mathematical descriptions of the system variables as functions of the system parameters 
that fit the data over the relevant range of operating conditions.

2001; Springer, Rockward et al. 2001; Van Nguyen and Knobbe 2003)  These models 
have included the molecular details of electron transfer reactions at electrode surfaces, 
transport of the reactants and products through multiple layers associated with the 
electrodes, as well as the transport of water and protons through the polymer electrolyte.  
Steady-state current/voltage response characteristics of a PEM fuel cell have been fit by 
these models.  However, these models are complex and they have not validated with 
dynamic behavior of PEM fuel cells.  Indeed, these models have emphasized steady state

cell dynamics.  The model fuel cell is a one-dimensional differential reactor with 
uniform, independently controllable, well-defined gas phase compositions at the anode 
and cathode.  The model fuel cell can be thought of as two stirred tank reactors coupled 
by a membrane; we refer to this model fuel cell as the STR PEM fuel cell.  The one-
dimensional structure of the STR PEM fuel cell  greatly simplifies the dynamic response 
to changes in system parameters.   Furthermore, the performance of the STR PEM fuel 
cell can be used as the basis to scale and predict the performance of larger more complex 
fuel cell reactor systems.

This paper will describe the STR PEM fuel cell and the rationale behind its 
 
design.  The STR PEM fuel cell is compared to existing fuel cell test stations to illustrate 
its unique capabilities.  A system’s analysis is presented to identify the key control 
parameters affecting the operation of PEM fuel cells.  A reaction engineering model of a 
differential element in a PEM fuel cell is presented to show the essential information 
required to predict the dynamic behavior.  Finally, we present results of the start- up of 
PEM fuel cells and the responses of the fuel cell to changes in load, temperature and 
reactant flow.    
 
II. THE DIFFERENTIAL PEM REACTOR 
II.1. The STR PEM Design 
A schematic of our STR PEM fuel cell is shown in Figure 2.  The membrane-
 
electrode-assembly (MEA) was pressed between two machined graphite plates and sealed 
with a silicon rubber gasket.  Gas plenums of volume, V ~0.2 cm3, were machined in 
graphite plates above a membrane area of ~1 cm2.  There were several pillars matched 
between the two plates to apply uniform pressure to the MEA.  Hydrogen and oxygen 
were supplied from commercial cylinders (Airco) through mass flow controllers at flow 
rates, Q~1-10 cm3/min (mL/min).  The residence times of the reactants in the gas 
plenums (V/Q) were greater than the characteristic diffusion time (V2/3/D), ensuring 
uniformity of the gas compositions.  The cell temperature was controlled by placing the 
graphite plates between aluminum plates fitted with cartridge heaters connected to a 
temperature controller.  The entire fuel cell assembly was mounted inside an aluminum 
box to maintain better temperature uniformity (see Figure 2B). 
 
valves (Swagelok) at the outlets.  Tees were placed in the outlet lines (inside the 
aluminum box) with relative humidity sensors in the dead legs of the tees.  The water 
content of the outlet streams was measured with humidity sensors (Honeywell HIH 
3610), and the temperature at the humidity sensor was measured with a thermocouple in 
the gas line.  The relative humidity sensors had to be sufficiently heated to avoid liquid 
condensation on the capacitive sensing element, but they also had to be kept below 85(cid:176)  to 
protect the amplifier circuit on the sensor chip.  
 
PEM fuel cell.  We report here results using an MEA consisting of a Nafion(cid:212)
membrane pressed between 2 E-tek electrodes (these consist of a carbon cloth coated on 
one side with a Pt/C catalyst).  The catalyst weight loading was 0.4 mg-Pt/cm2.  The 
electrodes were brushed with solubilized Nafion solution  to a loading of ~4 mg-
Nafion/cm2 before placing the membrane between them. (Raistrick 1989)  The assembly 
was hot pressed at 130(cid:176) C and 10 MPa. Copper foils were pressed against the graphite 
plates and copper wires were attached to connect to the external load resistor.

II.2. Comparison of the STR PEM and Serpentine Flow PEM Test Stations 
 
standard PEM fuel cell test station is associated with the gas flow fields.  Figure 3 
compares the serpentine flow fields for a GlobeTech Fuel Cell Test Station 2 and our 
STR PEM fuel cell reactor.  The GlobeTech test station has MEA area of 5 cm2, with 
serpentine flow channels approximately 100 mm long and 1 mm2 cross-sectional area.  In 
the STR PEM the MEA area is ~ 1 cm2, flow channels are approximately 14 mm long 
with a cross-sectional area of 4 mm2.  Mixing in the gas flow channels is characterized by 
the ratio of diffusive transport (D/L =diffusivity/length of flow channel) to convective 
transport (u=gas velocity).  When D/uL>1 diffusive mixing dominates over convective 
flow and there will be homogeneity in the fluid composition.  
 
The characteristic dispersion number at both the anode and cathode is =1 when 
the feed flow rates to the STR PEM <10 cm3/min (corresponding to a current density of 
1.4 A/cm2 at 100% hydrogen utilization).  In contrast, the dispersion number is <0.02 for 
the serpentine flow channels with flow rates of 50 cm3/min (also corresponding to an 
average current density of 1.4 A/cm2 at 100% hydrogen utilization).  Diffusive mixing in 
the STR PEM homogenizes the gas phase composition at each electrode.  However, 
convection in the serpentine flow PEM fuel cell test station results in compositional 
variations along the length of the flow channels.  In chemical reaction engineering jargon, 
the Globe Tech test station is a plug flow reactor, whereas our differential reactor is a 
stirred tank reactor.  The gas phase uniformity above the anode and cathode simplifies 
the analysis of the STR PEM data.  The system is one dimensional; only gradients 
transverse to the membrane are important.  The current density, or reaction rate, in the

Figure 3.  The flow fields, machined in graphite plates, for a “typical” (GlobeTech) PEM 
test station and for the STR PEM reactor.  The Serpentine flow channels cover an area of 
5 cm2, while the STR PEM fuel cell covers an area of ~1 cm2.  The two different 
configurations are drawn to the same scale.  The open plenum area of the STR PEM 
reactor permits sufficient diffusive mixing to give near uniform gas phase composition. 
 
 
It is possible to operate the serpentine flow channel test station  in a differential 
mode by limiting the reactant conversion so the concentration gradients along the flow 
channel the flow rates are small.  Keeping the fractional conversion of the reactants <5% 
will give nearly homogeneous compositions at the anode and cathode.  However, the 
current density should be limited to 60 mA/cm2 for a serpentine flow channel test station 
to be differential.

conditions?  How do the system parameters affect start- up of the fuel cell?

Temperature? Gas flow rate? 

3.  How should the system parameters be controlled under conditions of variable 

load, such as encountered in automotive applications? 

 
The preliminary results presented in this paper illustrate some of the complexities 
associated with PEM fuel cell dynamics we have identified with our STR PEM fuel cell.  
Detailed studies and analyses of the fuel cell dynamics will be the subject of future 
papers. 
A real PEM fuel cell reactor is complex.  Electrode reactions and transport 
 
through the gas channels, diffusion through the electrode layers and transport across the 
membrane are all coupled.  Datta and co-workers have described of the structure of PEM 
fuel cells and the molecular details of the transport and reaction in the PEM fuel 
cell.(Thampan, Malhotra et al. 2001)  However, these models assume descriptions about 
transport processes and electrode kinetics and call for data about system variables that 
cannot be directly measured or controlled.  We have followed an engineering approach 
and considered to what level of detail the system variables in the fuel cell can be 
described as functions of the parameters under operator control.  Our ultimate objective is 
to develop a good reactor model that includes the essential physics but eliminates 
unnecessary detail. 
 
cell.  The system parameters are under operator control, whereas the system variables 
describe the local state of the PEM fuel cell.  For example, the feed to the fuel cell can be 
regulated, but the local composition and flow rate along the flow channel are determined 
by dynamic mass balances.  Similarly, water supplied in the feeds is a controlled 
parameter, while the local membrane water content is a system variable that depends on 
the balance between water supplied in the feed, water produced at the cathode and water 
removed in the effluents.  The fuel cell current and voltage are system variables 
determined by the state of the membrane and the entire circuit including the controllable 
external load resistance.  We will report operation of the STR PEM reactor under 
conditions of defined load resistance.

We can divide the system parameters listed in Table I into two groups.  One group 
of parameters is fixed by the choice of reactor construction, and those remain fixed unless 
one builds a new reactor.  These parameters include choice of membrane, catalyst and 
flow field.  The second group is the parameters that can be manipulated externally during 
the operation of the fuel cell reactor.  These are the feed flow rates, the feed 
compositions, the heat input (or removal) and the external load resistance.  Ideally one 
would like to know the values of all the system variables during the fuel cell operation.  
In practice only a few of these quantities are directly observable (measurable).  We have

designed our STR PEM fuel cell so that the temperature, pressure, gas phase water 
content in the anode and cathode effluents and the cell current and voltage can be 
measured.  The STR PEM fuel cell minimizes lateral spatial variations, so the current 
density and gas composition are uniform across the gas-electrode- membrane interface.   
The STR PEM fuel cell can be thought of as a differential element along the flow 
 
channel in a PEM fuel cell.  The differential element is shown in Figure 4, along with the 
differential material balances (we will treat the fuel cell as isothermal in this paper – 
energy balances will be the topic of a subsequent paper).  We employ a lumped parameter 
model, which emphasizes the functional description of the fuel cell based on controllable 
parameters and observable variables.  Equations 1-9 summarize the model equations in 
the differential reactor element.  Equations 1-3 are mass balances for hydrogen, oxygen 
and water.  Equation 7 represents the reaction rate for water formation, which is equal to 
½ the proton current.  The remaining equations are the relations between different system 
variables.  The terms in the equations are defined in the nomenclature section at the end 
of the paper. 
 
II.4 Reactor Model of a PEM Fuel Cell 
 
The system parameters for the fuel cell are slightly different from those of a 
typical chemical reactor.  In addition to feed flow rates, composition and temperature, the 
external load resistance is a new parameter.  The fuel cell can be thought of as a set of 
reactors connected through a set of flow regulators, as shown in Figure 5.  Hydrogen 
molecules are oxidized to protons and electrons, at the anode.  The resistances in the 
membrane and external load regulate the current in the fuel cell (i.e. the flow of protons 
and electrons.  The protons and electrons meet up at the cathode along with the oxygen to 
produce water.  The external load resistance is analogous to a valve that regulates the 
flow of product out of the anode reactor to the cathode reactor.   
 
the fuel cell as a chemical reactor.  The system parameters are the feed flow rates, 
composition, the heat input and the external load resistance.  (Our STR PEM fuel cell is 
small and generates little heat. It is surrounded with a large heat source/sink creating a 
uniform temperature so temperature may be treated as a fixed system variable.)  We 
present data with the external load resistance as the independent parameter.  This is 
different than the traditional electrochemistry approach where PEM fuel cells are 
operated under galvanostatic or potentiostatic control (constant current or constant 
voltage).  When the chemical reaction is driven by the imposition of an external electrical 
driving force, such as with electrolysis of water, the current or voltage is a system 
parameter that can be independently manipulated.  However, in a fuel cell the chemical 
reaction drives the current through the external load, and the load resistance is the system 
parameter that can be manipulated.  Constant current or voltage requires a feedback 
controller that adjusts the external resistance to maintain the current of voltage.  We wish 
to understand the autonomous operation of the PEM fuel cell; operation of the fuel cell 
under galvanostatic or potentiostatic control distorts the autonomous dynamics and 
obscures the direct determination of kinetics. 
 

The coupling of reactor elements shown in Figure 5 is the basis for our analysis of

the physical boundary of the fuel cell.  The feed flow and composition at the anode and 
cathode are system parameters shown as inputs.  The effluents leaving the anode and

cell are analogous to valves that regulate flow of the intermediate products from the 
anode to the cathode.  The dashed line going through the valves indicates that the 
resistance to flow of  those two regulating valves is in series.  The load resistance is

external load resistance.  We measure the effluent flow rate and composition, the voltage 
across the external load and the current through the external load.  The key system 
variable that we cannot measure directly in our setup is the membrane water activity.  
The membrane water activity determines the proton conductivity of the membrane, which 
along with the external load resistance controls the current and voltage associated with 
the fuel cell.  Equation 9 relates the effective fuel cell voltage to the system variables and 
parameters, the first two terms on the right hand side of equation 9 are the 
thermodynamic potential.  The last term is the overpotentia l, representing a kinetic 
limitation.  We have expressed the overpotential as a function of water activity in the 
membrane and load resistance.  Normally the overpotential is expressed as a function of 
the current density.  However, the load resistance and membrane resistance, which is a 
function of the water activity, determine the current and in turn the overpotential.

but how much water is sufficient?  We show two experiments that illustrate the 
importance of water in the start- up of PEM fuel cells.  A series of experiments are then 
presented where changes in the system parameters alter the balance between water 
production and removal and change the water activity in the membrane.  The membrane 
is a reservoir for water, and the resistance of the membrane change as the water inventory

humidify the memb rane is produced by the fuel cell reaction. Shown in Figure 6 is the 
current response for start-up of the STR PEM fuel cell operated in the autohumidification 
mode.   Prior to start-up of the STR PEM fuel cell, the initial water content in the 
membrane and the load resistance were fixed.  The polymer membrane was dried by 
flowing dry oxygen through the cathode chamber at ~100 mL/min and dry nitrogen 
through the anode chamber at ~100 mL/min for ~12 hours at 60ºC.  To humidify the 
membrane, the oxygen flow was shut off, and 10 mL/min nitrogen flow was passed 
through a water bubbler at room temperature and into the anode chamber.  The relative 
humidity was measured at the outlet of the anode as a function of time to determine the 
water uptake by the membrane.  After hydrating the membrane to the desired level, the 
nitrogen flow was stopped.  Hydrogen flow at 10 mL/min to the anode and oxygen flow 
at 10 mL/min to the cathode were initiated, and the current through the load resistor (set 
at 5 W
) was measured as a function of time.  For initial membrane water concentrations 
of <0.6 mg/cm2 the fuel cell current decayed with time to near zero (the fuel cell current 
was “extinguished”).  When the water concentration in the membrane was ~0.8 mg/cm2 
the fuel cell current “ignited”, rising from an initial value of ~16 mA to a final value of 
130 mA.  The relative humidity  in the effluents followed the same trends as the fuel cell 
current, when the current decayed the relative humidity  in both streams approached zero, 
and when the fuel cell current increased the relative humidity increased.  The critical 
initial water content for sustained operation corresponds to “ignition” of the fuel cell.  
When the initial membrane water content is greater than the critical level water 
production is sufficient to sustain the water content in the membrane.  At lesser initial 
water content the resistance to proton current is too great and evaporation of water from 
the membrane exceeds water production dehydrating the membrane and extinguishes the 
current. 
 
Figure 6B shows an experiment where the initial water loading in the membrane 
was the same, but the external load resistance was changed.  The flow rates were still set 
to 10 mL/min for both H2 and O2 and the fuel cell temperature was 60°C.  With an 
external load resistance of 5 W
 the fuel cell current ignited, rising from ~20 mA to a final 
value of 150 mA.  In contrast when the external load resistance was 20 W
 the current was 
extinguished, starting at ~7 mA and decaying.  This result illustrates how the membrane 
and external load resistances act in series, and either one could limit the ultimate steady 
state current.

Humidifying the reactant feed may also result in ignition of the fuel cell.  Figure 7 

Figure 6B. STR PEM fuel cell start- up with 
different load resistances.  The initial water 
content in both cases was ~0.8 mg/cm2.  
The fuel cell was operated at 60°C and a 
flow of 10 mL/min of H2 to the anode and 
O2 to the cathode. 

Figure 6A.  STR PEM fuel cell start- up 
from different initial membrane water 
contents.  The membrane was exposed to 
humidified nitrogen at room temperature to 
hydrate it, and then heated to 60°C and a 
flow of 10 mL/min of H2 to the anode and 
O2 to the cathode was initiated. 
 
III.2. Critical Humidification of Reactant Feed 
 
shows an experiment where the STR PEM fuel cell was initialized as described above 
with a “dry” membrane (the membrane was dried by flowing dry gases passing through 
the fuel cell at 60°C for 12 hours).  At time zero dry O2 was introduced to the fuel cell at 
10 cm3/min, and 10 cm3/min  H2 feed was first passed through a bubbler.  The bubbler 
temperature was controlled with an external heating tape connected to a Variac.  
Humidification of the anode feed the fuel cell “ignited” as shown in Figure 7A. After 
ignition the water produced further increases the water activity of the fuel cell effluents.  
The critical feed humidification  for ignition is demonstrated in Figure 7B.  Increasing the 
humidifier temperature from 25 to 30ºC resulted in ignition of the fuel cell current.  
Further increase in the humidifier temperature to 35ºC resulted in more rapid 
humidification of the membrane and earlier ignition of the fuel cell, but the final steady 
state current was the same.  The final steady state current depends primarily on the water 
activity in the membrane, and only indirectly on the water content of the feed (as a 
threshold for ignition). 
 
water activity and the reaction rate.  Increased membrane water activity decreases the 
membrane resistance, which according to equation 7 will increase the fuel cell current.  
The increased current produces more water that will further increase the water activity in 
the membrane.  The current increase is self- limiting.  At high membrane water activity 
liquid water condenses in the catalyst layer of the cathode inhibiting oxygen mass 
transport to the cathode.  This corresponds to a shift in the rate-limiting step in the fuel 
cell reaction from transport across the membrane to reactant transport from the gas to the 
cathode surface. 

The ignition phenomenon results from a positive feedback between  the membrane

The ignition phenomenon reported here shows a direct analogy to thermal ignition 

 
for exothermic reactions in stirred tank reactors.  With the autothermal reactor there is a 
critical initial temperature for ignition.  The reactor can also be ignited by preheating the 
reactor feed.(Liljenroth 1918; van Heerden 1953; Froment and Bischoff 1979; Folger 
1999)

the load.  Changing the load alters the water production changing  the balance between 
water produced and water removed, resulting in a change in the membrane water content.  
The effect of the load resistance on the water activity can be seen in the polarization 
curves for the STR PEM fuel cell shown in Figure 8A.  The STR PEM fuel cell was 
operated in the autohumidification mode.  The STR PEM fuel cell was equilibrated at 
80°C for 12 hr with a fixed load resistance (either 0.2 ? or 20 ?).  After equilibration the 
polarization curve was obtained by sweeping the load resistance between 0.2-20 W
 in 100 
s. The relative humidity in the anode and cathode streams changed by <2% while 
obtaining these polarization curves; for all practical purposes these polarization curves 
are taken at “constant” membrane water activity. 
Figure 8A illustrates that the “instantaneous” polarization curve does not 
 
represent a unique characterization of the PEM fuel cell.  Operation with different load 
resistances for extended periods of time resulted in different membrane water activities.  
The membrane water activity is critical in defining the “instantaneous” polarization 
curve.  The striking feature about Figure 8A is that the two polarization curves cross.  
Extended operation with a low load resistance produced an MEA with “high” water 
content, while extended operation with a high load resistance produces an MEA with 
“low” water content.  The MEA with the high water content shows a higher voltage at 
low currents, indicating a lower activation polarization.  At high currents the “high” 
water content of the MEA shows a lower voltage suggesting the water is limiting mass

load resistance at 80°C for 12 hours.  The 
IV curves were recorded by sweeping the 
load resistance from 0-20 W
 in a period of 
100 s.   
 
The dynamic response of the STR PEM fuel cell to a change in resistive load 
 
shows an unusual multi-step process.  Figure 8B shows an immediate step response of the 
current to the change in  load, followed by decay to plateau value.  There was a 
subsequent jump in the fuel cell current after 1500 s.   The time constant for the rise to 
the initial plateau  was ~10 s.  There was a delay of ~100 s in the change of the water 
activity at the anode relative to the change in current and the change in water activity at 
the cathode.  The jump in current after 1500 s occurred with no changes to any external 
parameter and was completely unexpected.  The cathode relative humidity response 
tracks the current response; the anode relative humidity response tracked the current but 
was delayed by ~100 s.   
 
with the common assumption that PEM fuel cells have response times of milliseconds 
that make them appropriate for use in automobiles.  The data show at least four different 
time constants associated with the dynamic response of the fuel cell to changes in load.  
The initial response that occurs almost instantaneously must correspond to the change in 
current at constant membrane water content.  The other time constants must correspond 
to transport processes, and changes in the membrane properties that result from changes 
in membrane water content.  
 
What physical processes can account for the PEM fuel cell responses? 
We can compare various time constants associated with the PEM fuel cell.  Four 
 
of the key time constants are listed in Table II.  They include: the characteristic reaction

time of the PEM fuel cell (t 1), the time for gas phase transport across the diffusion layer 
to the membrane electrode interface (t 2), the characteristic time for water to diffuse 
across the membrane from the cathode to the anode (t 3), and the characteristic time for 
water produced to be absorbed by the membrane (t 4).  Approximate values for the 
physical parameters have been used to obtain order of magnitude estimates of these time 
constants.  The estimated time constants shown in Table II indicate that the response 
times of ~100 s are associated with water uptake and transport through the membrane. 
The 100 s time for water transport through the membrane is evident in the delay 
 
of the response of the water activity in the anode effluent compared to the rise in current.  
Water absorption by the membrane has a time constant of ~10-100 s.  Operating at a 
current density of 1 A/cm2 it would take ~100 s to saturate a dry membrane with water, 
assuming no water evaporates into the gas effluents from the fuel cell.  Likewise when 
the load resistance is increased the finite evaporation rate results in a slow decay to 
steady state.  The membrane acts as a reservoir for water as the external load resistance, 
reactant flow rates, and temperature changes alter the balance between water production 
and water removal.

100 s 

The 1500 s time constant for the second jump in the current shown in Figure 8B is 

 
 
still not well understood.  We have recently measured the stress relaxation of Nafion.  A 
Nafion 117 sample was strained to 50%,  beyond its yield point for plastic deformation, 
and the time stress was measured as a function of time.  At room temperature the stress 
took ~4000 s to relax to a constant value.  We believe the jump in the current after 1500 s 
is due to the relaxation of the stress in the membrane.  Increased membrane water content 
results in the membrane swelling which puts the membrane under stress.   Relaxation of 
the membrane stress appears to reduce the electrical resistance of the membrane.

The dynamic response of the fuel cell to changes in the temperature can be used 

 
III.4. Response to Temperature Changes 
 
to explore the dynamic response of fuel cells to changes in heat dissipated.  The response 
of the STR PEM fuel cell to a change in temperature is shown in Figure 9.  The fuel cell 
was operated with fixed feed flow rates of 10 mL/min H2 at the anode and 10 mL/min O2 
at the cathode.  The load resistance was fixed at 2 W
.  After changing the setpoint on the 
temperature controller, the temperature, cell current and voltage and the relative humidity 
in the anode and cathode effluents were monitored.  The temperature controller could 
actively heat the cell from 70 to 90°C in ~200 s; cooling was passive, so it took ~1400 s 
for the temperature to fall from 90 to 70°C.  As the temperature fell, the current and 
effluent relative humidities all increased.  The decrease in the water vapor pressure with 
temperature reduced the water removal rate.  With less water removed the water activity 
in the membrane increased resulting in a higher current.  The relative humidity  in the 
effluents also increased because the vapor pressure of water is lower, so even for the 
same partial pressure of water in the effluent streams the relative humidity is greater.

The response of the STR PEM fuel cell to an increase in temperature was 
surprising.  The current and relative humidity  in both effluent streams initially decreased.  
The current and cathode relative humidity went through minima before approaching the 
steady state.  This suggests that evaporation from the MEA is faster initially than the 
diffusion of water across the membrane in the MEA.  It took the current and relative 
humidity over 700 s to reach steady state, while the temperature was at steady state after 
only 200s.  The long  transition to steady state resulted from equilibration between water 
in the membrane and water at the membrane electrode interfaces.  The differences in the 
relative humidity responses at the anode and cathode are indicative of the complex 
coupling between water transport into and through the membrane and water production at 
the cathode.

Raising the temperature increased the water vapor pressure which increases the 

 
water removal rate from the fuel cell.  At constant water activity the membrane resistance 
has a weak temperature dependence.(Yang 2003)  Increasing the temperature from 80-
140°C, decreases the resistivity of Nafion by 50%.  The water vapor pressure increased 
by approximately 700% over the same temperature span.  With all else the same, the 
higher temperature will reduce the water content in the membrane and ultimately reduce 
the current. 
 
III.4. DYNAMIC RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN REACTANT FLOW RATES 
 
 
The flow rates to the anode of the fuel cell should be varied during operation to 
achieve high hydrogen utilization.  The dynamic response of the STR PEM fuel cell to 
changes in H2 flow is shown in Figure 10.   The STR PEM fuel cell was equilibrated for 
12 hours with a H2 flow of 1 mL/min and then the H2 flow was rapidly increased to 10 
mL/min.  The oxygen flow to the cathode was kept constant at 10 mL/min.  The cell 
temperature was 80°C and the external load resistance was 2 W
increased from 3 mA to ~80 mA rapidly during the first 10 s after the change in flow rate.  
The current increased more slowly over the next 100 s and leveled off at ~100 mA.  The 
relative humidity at the cathode began to increase 10 s after the flow rate was increased 
and the current increased.  The cathode relative humidity continued to climb steadily as 
the current leveled off.  The current jumped suddenly after ~650 s from 105 to 145 mA, 
and the relative humidity at the cathode increased much more slowly after 650 s.  The 
anode relative humidity showed a steady increase for the entire 2000 s of the test run.

The dynamic response during the first 650 s shown in Figure 10 expected.  

 
Increasing the supply of hydrogen increased current and water production.  With more 
water produced, more water exited through the effluent streams, because of increased 
relative humidity.  The jump in the current after 650 s is surprising.  We believe the jump 
in current results from water swelling the membrane and mechanical stress relaxation 
improving the membrane-electrode contact.  We have seen this phenomenon in other 
contexts of PEM fuel cell dynamics and it is the subject on on-going investigations. 
 
III.5. DYNAMICS OF “STEADY STATE” OPERATION 
 
 
The dynamic data presented so far were all in response to changes in system 
parameters.  We chose to present “well-behaved” responses, so that the behavior could be 
easily rationalized.  Dynamic data for the STR PEM fuel cell can be much more complex 
than what we presented here.  We conclude with an example that illustrates some of the 
complex dynamics of the STR PEM fuel cell that are still far from being understood.   
 
Figure 11 shows the steady state response of the STR PEM fuel cell over a 24-
hour period.  All the external controllable parameters were fixed.  The feed flow rates 
were constant at 5 mL/min of H2 to the anode and 10 mL/min O2 to the cathode.  The fuel 
cell temperature was fixed at 80°C and the load resistance was fixed at 20W
.  The current, 
voltage, and relative humidity in the effluent streams all displayed autonomous 
oscillations with a frequency of 10-4 Hz!  The current oscillations were large amplitude, 
changing by a factor of 2 between 75 to 170 mA.  The current oscillations overshot and 
undershot the plateau values at the high and low states.  The effluent relative humidity at 
both the anode and cathode oscillated in phase with the current.

We have observed these autonomous oscillations under a variety of conditions of 

 
temperature, flow rate and load resistance.  We believe they are caused by coupling 
between the mechanical relaxation of the polymer membrane to changes in the water 
content.  However, we are still a long way from understanding the physics in sufficient 
detail to develop predictive dynamic models for these results.  Complex dynamic 
behavior has been anecdotally reported for fuel cell test stations, but seems to have been 
ignored because of lack of models that predict any such behavior.  The STR PEM fuel 
cell displays the oscillations distinctly, and we believe by uncoupling the temporal 
oscillations from spatial variations we can clarify their origin and control them.   Data of 
this quality and relative simplicity shown here is essential to understand the complex 
dynamics of PEM fuel cells.   
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
 
study fuel cell dynamics.  The data presented in this paper show that the PEM fuel cell 
responses are characterized by time constants varying from less than a second to 
thousands of seconds.  The STR PEM fuel cell is a one-dimensional differential reactor 
that is ideally suited to examine dynamics of the coupling of reaction and transport 
processes in a polymer membrane fuel cell. The STR PEM has even unveiled novel 
behavior that suggests mechanical properties of the polymer membranes may play an 
important role in fuel cell dynamics.  
The STR PEM fuel cell is not an optimal design of a fuel cell reactor in the sense 
 
of obtaining the highest power output or highest fuel efficiency.  Its purpose is to provide 
a well-defined set of reactor conditions to facilitate the correlation of fuel cell operation 
with process parameters.  We have stressed the importance of characterizing the system 
variables and relating them to changes in the system parameters.  This approach is vital to 
the development of effective control systems for fuel cells. 
 
critical role the water balance plays in the dynamics of ignition.  The water activity in the 
membrane must equilibrate to changes in the control parameters, feed flow rates, cell 
temperature and load resistance.  Changes in the control parameters alter the balance 
between water production and water removal.  PEM fuel cells typically have at least two 
time constants associated with their transient responses.  There is a very rapid response, 
time constant < 1 s, corresponding to the changes in external load at constant membrane 
water activity.  There are longer responses with a time constants of ~100 s corresponding 
to water transport in the membrane and equilibration of the membrane water activity.  
Lastly we showed there are additional dynamical processes with time constants of 
~1,000-10,000 s, probably due to mechanical relaxation processes that are not yet fully 
understood.  
 

The STR PEM fuel cell has exemplified how PEM fuel cells “ignite” and the

Abstract 

 
Recent observations on Type-Ia  supernovae  and low density ( (cid:1)m=0.3) measurement of  matter including dark matter  
suggest that the present day universe consists  mainly of  repulsive-gravity type ‘exotic matter’ with negative-pressure 
often referred as ‘dark energy’((cid:1)x=0.7). But the mystery is about the nature of dark energy  and its  puzzling questions 
such as  why, how, where & when  about the dark energy are  intriguing. In the present paper the author attempts to 
answer these questions  while making an effort to reveal the genesis of dark energy, and suggests that the cosmological 
nuclear binding energy liberated  during primordial nucleo-synthesis remains trapped for long time and then is released 
free which manifests itself as dark energy in the universe. It is also explained why for dark energy the parameter w =    
-2/3. Noting that w=+1for stiff matter  and w=+1/3 for radiation; w = - 2/3 is for dark energy,  because ‘-1’ is due to 
‘deficiency of stiff-nuclear-matter’ and that this binding energy is ultimately released as ‘radiation’ contributing ‘+1/3’, 
making w = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3. This  thus almost solves the dark-energy mystery of negative-pressure & repulsive-gravity.   
It  is  concluded  that  dark  energy  is  a  consequence  of  released-free  nuclear  energy  of  cosmos.  The  proposed  theory 
makes several estimates / predictions, which agree reasonably well with the astrophysical constraints & observations.  
 
 

1. Introduction 
 
 
It is an irony of  nature and puzzling that most abundant form of  matter-energy in the universe is 
also most mysterious.  Supernovas at relatively high red shift are found fainter than that predicted for an 
earlier-thought  slowing-expansion  and  indicate  that  expansion  of  universe  is  actually  speeding  up  [1-3].  
Recent studies [3,4] firmly establish that universe is now undergoing an acceleration; with repulsive gravity 
of  some  strange  energy-form  i.e.,  dark-energy  at  work.    Dark  energy,  a    ‘mysterious  substance’  whose 
pressure is ‘negative’ and accounts for 70% of total matter-energy budget of the universe, but has no clear 
explanation.  Understanding  its  origin  &  nature  is  one  of  the  greatest  problems  of  present  time.    In  the 
present paper; a modest approach has been made to explain the genesis of this dark energy, suggesting that 
dark-energy is a result of released-free cosmological nuclear-energy in the universe.

ao/a = (1 + Z) 

Usually  a  parameter  called  cosmological  red-shift  (Z)  is  often  referred  as  a  measure  of    the  era 
(time  t)  of  the  universe.  For  example;  Zo  corresponds  to  the  present  time  to  with  present  universe  size 
(scale)  ao  ,  and    Z    corresponds  to  some  time  t  in  the  past  with  a  smaller  universe  size  a.    In  fact  the 
cosmological red-shift for spectral-line (wavelength (cid:4))  is defined as   Z = d(cid:4)/(cid:4)= (ao – a)/a = ao/a – 1 :  thus  
Z also gives a measure of universe size at a particular time, higher Z means smaller universe size in the past  
and is expressed as,

3. Nuclear Genesis of Dark Energy 
 
 
3.1 Negative pressure due to free-release of cosmological nuclear energy 
 
It  is  suggested  that  dark  energy  is  a  consequence  of  nuclear  energy.  The  fusion  nuclear  binding 
 
energy  begins  to  be  liberated  (but  trapped)  during  primordial  nucleo-synthesis,  and  much  later  (Z  =  80) 
after  decoupling,    the  nuclear  binding  energy  is  released  free  and  appears  effectively  as  dark  energy.         
As  shown  (Fig.2)  in  subsequent  sections  of  the  paper;  that  this  dark  energy  is  produced  earlier  but  is 
released free  later, quantity-wise ((cid:1)x = 0.0003) insignificant;  remains low during galaxy formation (say, at 
Z = 3, (cid:1)x = 0.1), becomes 50% at transition (Z = 0.5, (cid:1)x = 0.5) & emerges as dominant at present time 
(Z=0, (cid:1)x = 0.7) , satisfying all the astrophysical constraints [5]. 
 
 
The  equation  of  state  parameter  w    for  dark  energy  (quintessence)  is  taken  as    w  =  -2/3.      The 
reason for w = -2/3 = -1 + 1/3  is explained  as follows.  Noting that w = +1 for stiff matter  &  w = 1/3 for 
radiation;   ‘-1’ is due to ‘deficiency of stiff(nuclear)matter’ which is manifested as mass-defect (binding-
energy)  and  ‘1/3’ is because this released binding-energy though initially-trapped but is finally released as 
‘radiation’.    Thus  considering  that  the  binding-energy  due  to  mass-defect(deficiency)  from  stiff-nucleus 
finally comes out as radiation; the equation of state parameter w = -1 + 1/3 = -2/3.  The puzzle of negative 
pressure (or repulsive gravity) is thus almost  solved;  the  negative pressure (or dark energy) is produced  
due to released-free cosmological nuclear energy ! 
 
 
3.2 Variation of matter-density and dark-energy-density  much after decoupling era  between  Z = 80       
       to  Z=0 
 
 
Stiff  matter  density  decays  very  fast  and  vanishes  very  soon.  Radiation  density  also  decays  fast 
and vanishes soon much after decoupling era.  Although, as explained in section 3.3 & in Fig.2,  the dark- 
energy  is  born  much  earlier  in  the  past  at  about  Z  =1010  but  remains  trapped  dormant  and  decays  in 
constrained way along with the matter  and is released free only after Z = 80 to be effective & dominant.  
So, between Z =80 to Z = 0  variations of  radiation-density, matter-density and dark-energy-density (Eqs 
14, 15 & 16)  are considered as follows (Eqs.18, 19 & 20). The symbol (cid:3)  is for density and (cid:1) for density 
ratio (cid:3)/(cid:3)c ;  the subscript m, r , x are for matter, radiation, dark energy and the subscript o   indicates the 
values at present time (Z =0).  It can be said that for flat universe ((cid:3)=(cid:3)c), 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
where radiation-density, matter-density and dark-energy-density varies (from Eqs.14, 15 & 16) as  follows, 
taking the present values of densities  (cid:3)mo ~ 10-28 gram/cm3, (cid:3)xo ~ 2x10-28 gram/cm3, (cid:3)ro ~ 10-31 gram/cm3    
or    (cid:1)mo ~ 0.3  &  (cid:1)xo ~ 0.7 and negligibly small  (cid:1)ro ~ 0.0003 ; 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

(cid:1)c = (cid:3)/(cid:3)c ,   (cid:1)r = (cid:3)r/(cid:3)c ,   (cid:1)m = (cid:3)m/(cid:3)c ,   (cid:1)x = (cid:3)x/(cid:3)c 

(cid:3)x = (cid:3)xo ao/a  = 0.7 (cid:3)c (1 + Z) 

4/a4 = 0.0003 (cid:3)c (1 + Z)4 

3/a3 = 0.3 (cid:3)c (1 + Z)3 

(cid:1)c = 1 = (cid:1)r + (cid:1)m + (cid:1)x  

(cid:3) = (cid:3)c =  (cid:3)r + (cid:3)m + (cid:3)x 

(cid:3)m = (cid:3)mo ao

(cid:3)r = (cid:3)ro ao

3.3 Biography of  Dark Energy 
 
 
Biography of mysterious dark-energy is even more mysterious. Nevertheless a brief biographical 
description of dark energy is presented here somewhat idiomatically/metaphorically for interesting-clarity.  

Dark energy  in fact  is the released nuclear binding energy of cosmos.  Dark energy is born during 
 
primordial  nucleo-synthesis  epoch    (Z  ~  1010)  in  the  early  universe  out  of  ‘mother’  matter  present  there, 
when while the nucleo-synthesis (of say, Helium) liberates the binding energy as the ‘child’ but  the child is 
trapped  in  or  around  mother’s  lap  and  remains  almost  dormant  for  long  period  and  moves  parallel  to 
mother’s foot-steps. Approximate weight of this dormant dark-energy (child) is roughly estimated as 1% of 
binding  energy,  of  25%  of  primordial  helium-synthesis,  from  13%  of  baryonic-matter  ((cid:1)b=0.04)  out  of 
total  mass  of  (mother)  matter  ((cid:1)m=0.3);  this  comes  out  to  be  (cid:3)x/(cid:3)m  =  0.000325    and  since  this  era  is 
radiation dominated era (cid:3)r being extremely high   gives (cid:1)x very close to zero. This ‘child’ i.e., dark-energy 
(nuclear-binding-energy  liberated)  though  has  come  out  of  mother’s  womb(nucleus)  remains  trapped  /   
dormant for quite long time atleast upto decoupling era Z =1000 and even beyond  when positive radiation 
((cid:3)r)    pressure  is  much  more  dominant  than  the  negative  pressure  of  dark  energy  radiation  ((cid:3)x),  the  free-
release of this dark energy is thus prohibited till then. While the universe is expanding, the dark energy (the 
child) however decays parallel to matter (mother) foot-steps at the same rate ( (cid:3) ~ 1/a3) from Z =1010  to Z = 
1000 and even beyond Z < 100  upto Z =80 (Fig.2).  At Z =80, though dark energy (cid:1)x still being less than 
(cid:1)r (which opposes liberation of the trapped dark energy) but  (cid:1)x is sufficient enough to fight with (cid:1)r ,  the 
dark energy is ultimately released.  Thus at Z =80, the dark energy (child) is released free from mother’s 
constrained-protection. Then onwards (Z<80) the matter density continues to decay at the same rate (1/a3), 
but the dark energy (with w = - 2/3 = -1 + 1/3, as explained earlier in section 3.1) density decays at much 
slower rate (1/a) till today (Z=0). Between Z=80  to  Z=0,  the dark energy density curve ((cid:3)x ~ 1/a)  crosses  
radiation density curve ((cid:3)r ~ 1/a4) at Z=12  and crosses  matter density curve ((cid:3)m ~ 1/a3) at Z=0.5.  Briefly 
as summary (Fig.2): ‘ Dark energy is born as a result of liberated binding energy during primordial nucleo-
synthesis at Z ~ 1010  as a very very small fraction ((cid:3)x/(cid:3)m ~ 0.0003, (cid:1)x ~ 0) of total matter-mass,  initially 
(stage-1)  it  remains  trapped/dormant  and  decays  at  fast  rate  (1/a3)  alongwith  matter  till  Z=80  ((cid:3)x/(cid:3)m    ~ 
0.0003, (cid:1)x ~ 0.0003) and finally it is released free (stage-2) & decays slowly (1/a) between Z=80  to  Z=0 
and becomes more effective & even dominant today ((cid:3)x/(cid:3)m ~ 2, (cid:1)x ~ 0.7 )’.  In stage-1: (cid:1)x is almost equal 
to zero; whereas in stage-2: (cid:1)x increases as Z decreases, (cid:1)x=0.0003 at Z=80,  (cid:1)x=0.01 at Z=12, (cid:1)x=0.1 at 
Z=3, (cid:1)x=0.5 at Z=0.5 and (cid:1)x=0.7 at Z=0. The ‘mantra’ of dark energy hidden in nucleus comes out free  
and speaks loud as  ‘ -1  + 1/3 = - 2/3 ’ . 
 
 
4. Estimation of  Z  and  (cid:1)x 
 

For present time;  Z = Zo = 0 ,  (cid:1)x = 0.7 ,  (cid:1)m = 0.3  (Present known values). 

For matter/dark-energy transition ((cid:3)m = (cid:3)x );  Z can be estimated from Eqs. 19 & 20 as  ZT = 
0.5 . 

For galaxy formation (say at  Z =Zg =3);  (cid:1)x can be estimated from Eqs. 17-20 as  (cid:1)xg = 0.1 . 

For radiation/dark-energy transition ((cid:3)r = (cid:3)x); Z can be estimated from Eqs. 18 & 20 as Z = Zt 
= 12. 

At  Z = Zf = 80 when dark-energy is released ‘free’,  (cid:1)x  can be estimated (in stage-2) from 
Eqs.17-20 as (cid:1)xf = 0.0001.  The time Z=80 is  the joining point for stage-1 & stage-2 (Fig.2). 
In stage-1  (cid:3)x/m ~ 0.0003 remains constant, and for stage-2   (cid:3)x/(cid:3)m ~ 2/[(1+Z)2+2}; equating 
these gives Z ~ 80 as meeting point for the two stages. 

At decoupling epoch  ((cid:3)m = (cid:3)r)  Z = Zdec=1000 , (cid:1)x will be nearly half of initial value of (cid:3)x/(cid:3)m  
in stage-1 (Fig.2),  i.e.,  (cid:1)x=0.00015.

(vii) 

At  Z=Zn  =1010  during  nucleo-synthesis  era    birth  of  dark  energy  takes  place.  The  fusion 
nuclear  binding  energy  (=  1%)  begins  to  be  liberated  during  primordial  Helium  synthesis 
(25%)  from  13%  (0.13  =  0.04/0.3)  of  baryonic-matter  ((cid:1)bo  =  0.04)  out  of  total  matter-mass 
((cid:1)mo  =  0.3).  Considering  the  liberated  nuclear-binding-energy  as  the  dark-energy,  the       
dark-energy-density  is  roughly  estimated  (1%  of  25%  of  13%)  as    0.000325    of  the  total 
matter-density.    However, since radiation density at that high value of Z (at nucleo-synthesis 
time  Z=  Zn  ~  1010)  would  be  much  higher  than  that  of  matter,  the  estimated  value  for  (cid:1)xn  
would be close-to-zero. 

 

 

The  liberated  nuclear-energy    as  dark-energy,  however,  is  tracked  (as  mentioned  in 
section 3.3 and in Fig.2) in two stages. In trapped stage-1 (between Z = 1010 to Z = 80) the 
dark-energy is trapped & dormant and varies (1/a3) in a constrained way along with its parent 
matter;  whereas  in  free  stage-2  (between  Z  =80  to  Z=0)  the  dark-energy  is  released  free  & 
becomes effective/dominant and varies (1/a) at slower rate during universe expansion. At Z = 
1010  (cid:1)x ~ 0, at Z =80  (cid:1)x =0.0003, at Z=12  (cid:1)x =0.01, at Z = 3, (cid:1)x = 0.1, at Z = 0.5  (cid:1)x = 0.5 
and at Z = 0 (cid:1)x =0.7 . It may be noted that these estimates are quite reasonable and satisfy 
very well all the necessary astrophysical constraints [5].

The deceleration-parameter q = - a//.a/a/ 2  can be estimated at present time to ((cid:1)m=0.3, (cid:1)x=0.7) 

using Eqs. 23 and 21.b & 22.b and is found as qo = - 0.52 which indicates that the expansion of universe is 
not decelerating but accelerating. The current known value [3] is, however,  qo = - 0.67 . 
 
  
parameter q = -a//.a/a/ 2 which are described as follows: 
 

In fact, there could be following two approaches/methods/formulae to find the deceleration-

1.  Conventional Method 

 
The ‘deceleration parameter’ for ‘only  matter’ universe can easily be evaluated as qm = ½   and 
that for ‘only dark-energy’ universe as qx = ½ +  3/2 w .  So simple conventional method usually 
followed  assumes  that  the  actual  ‘deceleration  parameter  q  for  the  matter  plus  dark-energy 
universe’ is  ‘weighted sum of qm and qx’.  Thus, 
 
 
 
which gives for w = -2/3, (cid:1)mo =0.3, (cid:1)xo = 0.7 ;  qo = - 0.20  a value far different from actual 
known [3] value of  qo = - 0.67 and thus necessitates  modifications in evaluation  as follows. 
  

qo = ½ (cid:1)mo + ( ½  + 3/2 w ) (cid:1)xo  

(24) 

 

 

 

 

5 

2.  Modified Method 
 

 

(25) 

a = (cid:1)m.am + (cid:1)x.ax  = (cid:1)m. Km t 2/3 + (cid:1)x. Kx t 2/3(1+w)    

The  author  suggests  a  new  or  modified  method  to  evaluate  the  deceleration-parameter.    This 
modified method assumes that actual ‘space scale factor (a) for matter plus dark-energy universe’  
is  ‘weighted sum of  am and ax’. Thus the equation for total actual space-size (a) can be written 
(similar to Eq.23) as, 
 
 
 
The deceleration parameter q = - a//.a /a/ 2  is evaluated using Eqs.25 and 21.b & 22.b  in it  at 
present time to  as, 
 
 
 
which gives for w = - 2/3, (cid:1)mo = 0.3, (cid:1)xo = 0.7 ;  qo = - 0.52  (as found before using Eq.23) which 
is reasonably near to the known [3] observed  value of qo = - 0.67. 
 
Modified-method (Eq.26)  seems to be more correct than the conventional-method (Eq.24) since 
the  expansion  (acceleration)  of  universe  due  to  dark-energy  (a  ~  t2)  is  much  faster  than  the 
expansion (deceleration) of universe due to matter (a ~ t2/3). This fact is taken into account in the 
modified-method (in Eqs. 23, 25 ,26; the second terms more dominant).  So, the modified method 
predicts  more  nearer value of qo =  - 0.52,  instead of   - 0.20 from conventional  method,  to the 
known observed value of  - 0.67 .  

qo =  - [2/9 (cid:1)mo – 2/9 (1+3w)/(1+w)2 (cid:1)xo] / [2/3 (cid:1)mo + 2/3 /(1+w) (cid:1)xo]2 

(26) 

 
 
6. Discussions 
 
The exact time of birth Z=1010  or 109 can not be very precisely specified. It is suggested by the 
 
author that nuclear binding energy manifests itself as dark energy, but the beginning of nuclear energy and 
its completion is not exactly  defined/known.  There is two-stage tracking (decay) of dark energy (Fig.2).  
Initially in stage-1 the decay is constrained & fast during which the dark energy remains almost trapped / 
dormant for long time. Finally in stage-2 the dark energy is released free at Z =80 and decays slow and thus 
becomes more effective & dominant in due course. The free released nuclear binding energy plays its role 
as dark energy (with w = - 2/3) creating negative-pressure or  repulsive-gravity.  Dark energy  begins with 
close-to-zero  value  of  (cid:1)x  ,    remains  low  till  galaxy  formation  (Z=3,  (cid:1)x=0.1),  becomes  50%  at  transition 
((cid:1)x=0.5,  Z=0.5)  and  then  after    leads  to    accelerated  universe    becomes  dominant  at  present  time  (Z=0, 
(cid:1)x=0.7).  All  these  are  well  in  accordance  with  the  astrophysical  constraints  [5].    The  dark-energy 
variations, in stage-2 ((cid:3)x ~ 1/a) is governed by final/present condition (at Z =0)  and in stage-1 ((cid:3)x ~ 1/a3) is 
governed by initial/past condition (at Z =1010). The meeting point for the two stages (dotted & firm curves 
in Fig.2) is found at Z = 80. There could be some error in it (Z=80) due to approximations / estimations. 
Though meeting point is a point of interest in view that at this time  the dark-energy is finally released-free, 
however, any future change in its estimate (other than Z=80) will hardly have any effect on the other values 
(estimated in section 4)  or  on the theme & philosophy of the model  which will remain almost unchanged. 
 
For  estimating  the  deceleration  parameter,  the  author  suggests  a  more  realistic  modified-method 
 
(Eq.26)  which  gives  an  estimate  of  qo  =  -  0.52  against  the  observed  known  value  of  qo  =  -  0.67.    The 
agreement  is  not  bad.  The  discrepancy  in  the  value,  however,  may  be  due  to  following  reason:  the  dark 
energy as a result of liberation of nuclear binding energy  not only takes place during primordial nucleo-
synthesis  (Z  =  1010  or  109)  era    but  also  due  to  fusion  reaction  taking  place  within  stars  after  or  around 
galaxy formation (Z =4 to 0). It may be noted that only ‘primordial nucleo-synthesis’, which indeed is more 
significant, has been taken into consideration; but the ‘star nucleo-synthesis’ will also have some effect on 
acceleration  of  universe  i.e.,  on  the  deceleration  parameter  in  the  right  direction.    Also,  this  means  that 
nucleo-synthesis (thus liberation of dark energy) is more or less a continuous process. 
 
 
Though there are many suspects (candidates) such as [6,7] cosmological-constant, vacuum-energy, 
scalar-field, brane-world etc.  as reported in vast-literature  for the dark-energy;  the proposed model in this 

 

6 

paper    at  least  presents  a  fresh  new-candidate  (cosmological  nuclear-energy)  as  possible  suspect  for  the 
dark-energy.  All avenues for possible truth must be kept open. 
 
 
7. Conclusions 
 
 
The author proposes a novel model for genesis of dark energy, indicating its origin in nucleus and 
suggesting  that    it  is  the  released-free  nuclear  binding  energy  of  cosmos    which  manifests  itself  as  dark- 
energy causing negative-pressure & repulsive-gravity in the universe.  It explains why  for dark energy w = 
-2/3. Also, the model describes the biography of the dark energy and tells that (cid:1)x begins with a close-to-
zero value, remains low as necessary till galaxy formation say at Z=3  (cid:1)x=0.1, transition at Z=0.5  (cid:1)x=0.5  
and becomes dominant at present time Z=0  (cid:1)x=0.7;  satisfying very well  all the astrophysical constraints.  
The  author  also  proposes  a  modified-method  to  estimate  deceleration  parameter  and  finds  that  with  the 
proposed model qo = - 0.53 in reasonable agreement with known observed value.  It can be metaphorically 
said that ‘the dark energy is fossil of nuclear reaction that has taken place in the early universe  and that the 
fossil has recently been noticed  when the matter-cover over it has diminished in due course’.

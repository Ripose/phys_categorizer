The advent of ultra bright blue LEDs based on InGaN/GaN [1,2] structures at 

the  beginning  of  1990s  opened  new  era  in  the  development  of  nanosecond  light 

sources  for  use  in  different  fields  of  experimental  physics:  time  and  amplitude 

calibrations  of  Cherenkov  and  scintillator  detectors,  fluorescent  measurements, 

studies of fast processes kinetics [3-7] etc. 

To  drive  such  LEDs two types of  drivers are  widely  used.  One  of them  is so 

called “Kapustinsky’s driver” [8] which uses a fast discharge of a small capacitor 

via a complementary pair of fast transistors. The highest level of light yield and at 

the same time the shortest light pulses are reached with another driver type which 

exploits avalanche transistors to have very short, nanosecond width current pulses 

flowing through LED with amplitudes of up to 3A [7]. Drivers based on avalanche 

transistors are currently used in a number of astroparticle physics experiments such 

as the lake Baikal neutrino experiment [9], Cherenkov EAS detector TUNKA [10], 

MAGIC Telescope [11] etc.  

Currently a plethora of ultra bright blue LEDs are available in the market. We 

have  tested  LEDs  from  20  manufacturers:  NICHIA,  KINGBRIGHT,  Agilent 

Technologies,  LIGITEK,  Bright  LED,  LUXPIA,  COTCO  and  YolDal  among 

them.  For  stability  measurements  we  have  chosen  LEDs  produced  by  NICHIA 

CHEMICAL Ltd and KINGBRIGHT Corporation companies – NSPB500S (and/or 

NSPB300S)  and  L7113NBC  (and/or  L-53NBC)  correspondingly.  They  are  ultra 

bright  SQW  InGaN/GaN  LEDs  with  ~1‚ 2  cd  light  brightness  [12,13].  The  main 

 

2 

reason  to  choose  these  two  types  of  LEDs  was  that  they  were  the  fastest  among 

other ultra bright blue LEDs tested by us.  

The  longterm  stability  and  the  temperature  dependence  of  the  light  yield  of 

nanosecond  light  sources  based  on  the  blue  ultra  bright  LEDs  and  an  avalanche 

transistor driver were studied with the set-up presented in Fig.1. The light source 

under studies comprises LED  and an electrical driver. The driver scheme is shown 

in  Fig.2.  The  avalanche transistors are  FMMT415  manufactured by  ZETEX.  The 

discharge capacitor C3 was adjusted in the range of 3-10 pF to have current pulses 

flowing through the LED with amplitudes of 0.6-2.2 A. 

A  light  source  under  studies  is  put  into  a  thermostatic  chamber  with 

temperature stabilization of – 0.10C. The thermostate temperature is adjustable with 

1-30C  step.  To  illuminate  a  photomultiplier  (PMT)  photocathode  by  light  pulses 

from  the  light  source  arranged  in  the  thermostate  we  have  used  a  short  optical 

cable (F in Fig.1). A PMT used in the set-up was ET9116B developed by Electron 

Tubes  Ltd  for  MAGIC  Telescope  project [14].  ET9116B  is  a  fast six  stage  PMT 

with  a  hemispherical  photocathode  and  a  few  hundred  picoseconds  jitter.  The 

PMT’s  anode  pulses  are  amplified  by  a  fast  transimpedance  preamplifier  and 

LeCroy  612  amplifier.  We  have  used  LeCroy  2249A  unit  as  ADC  to  measure 

charges of the PMT anode pulses. BVT-12A [15] type of TDC with 75 ps step and 

5 m s range and constant fraction discriminators were used to measure light pulses 

profiles.  A  set  of  neutral  density  filters  was  used  to  have  ~100  photoelectrons 

 

3 

illumination  of  the  PMT  photocathode  for  charge  measurements  and  a  single 

photoelectron level of illumination to measure the LEDs light emission kinetics. 

To control stability of the whole measurement system a calibration source [16] 

(R  in  Fig.1)  made  of  a  thin  layer  of  YAlO3:Ce  scintillator  covered  with  Am241 

isotope  was  optically  coupled  to  the  PMT  window.  This  calibration  light  source 

provides pulses with amplitude of ~1000 p.e. on the PMT photocathode with ~100 

s-1  counting  rate.  The  long  term  stability  measurements  were  carried  out  at  room 

temperature.  The  level  of  fluctuations  of  the  whole  spectrometric  channel  gain 

including  the  PMT  gain  is  less  than  ~1  %,  see  Fig.3a  where  we  show  for  a 

convenience reason the dependence of the gain versus the total number of the light 

source  pulses.  The  width  and  amplitude  of  current  pulses  flowing  through  LED 

were  controlled  as  well  and  it’s  noteworthy  to  mention  here  they  were  stable 

throughout the measurement. 

We have measured the longterm stability at three amplitudes of current pulses 

running  through  LED  -  0.6A,  1.2A  and  2.2A.  Besides  the  measurements  were 

carried out at four repetition rates of the light source output pulses: 100Hz, 1kHz, 

10kHz  and  100  kHz  for  each  value  of  current  amplitude.  The  results  were 

practically the same for all currents and repetition rates. The results of the longterm 

stability measurements of the NICHIA and KINGBRIGHT LEDs are presented in 

Fig.3b  and  3c  respectively.  In  this  paper  we  present  the  data  gained  under  the 

harshest conditions – 2.2A current pulses and 100 kHz repetition rate. One can see 

the LEDs and driver parameters are very stable. The light yields of the sources did 

 

4 

not  show  any  deterioration  even  after  1010  total  output  pulses.  Furthermore  the 

fluctuations  of  the  measurement  system  gain  contribute  substantially  to  the  total 

fluctuations. In case of the KINGBRIGHT LEDs the fluctuations are a bit higher in 

comparison with the NICHIA LEDs but still less than 1% (compare Fig.3a with 3b 

and 3c). 

The  temperature dependencies of the  light  sources based  on the  NICHIA  and 

KINGBRIGHT LEDs are shown in Fig.4a and 4b respectively. It is interesting that 

the  two  types  of  LEDs  demonstrate  different  dependencies  on  temperature  in  the 

range  of  –30C‚

  +450C.  The  NICHIA  LEDs  light  yield  increases  by  ~7%  with 

temperature rise from -30C up to  +450C. The temperature dependence of the LED 

light yield is approximated well by the following expression: 

Y = Y0(1.12 – 0.15ea

a T),                                                (1) 

where a = - 0.015 0C-1 – temperature coefficient, T – temperature in 0C.  

In  contrary  with  the  NICHIA  LEDs  the  KINGBRIGHT  LEDs  have  inverse 

temperature behavior in the same temperature range. Their light yield decreases by 

~9%  when  temperature  increases  from  –30C  up  to  +450C  and  the  light  yield 

dependence on temperature is described by the following formulae: 

 

 

 

Y = Y0 (0.94 + 0.105ea

a T),                                                (2)

where a

 = - 0.026 0C-1 – temperature coefficient, T – temperature in 0C. 

We have controlled the light pulses temporal profiles during the longterm and 

temperature  stability  measurements.  The  dependencies  of  the  light  pulses  width 

(FWHM) on the total number of the light source output pulses and temperature are 

shown in Fig.5a and 5b respectively. One can see that the light pulses width didn’t 

notably alter throughout the measurements.  

To conclude nanosecond light sources based on SQW InGaN/GaN ultra bright 

blue LEDs NICHIA NSPB500S (NSPB300S) and KINGBRIGHT L7113NBC (L-

53NBC)  demonstrates  very  high  longterm  stability.  Their  light  yields  and  timing 

characteristics remain practically the same after 1010 pulses even under very harsh 

conditions: current pulses amplitude up to 2.2A and 100 kHz repetition rates. Quite 

unexpectedly the two types of LEDs show different behaviors of their light yields 

temperature  dependencies  in  the  temperature  range  –30C-+450C  but  their  timing 

characteristics are invariable in this temperature range. Altogether we have studied 

15  LEDs  of  each  type  in  our  measurements.  Characteristics  of  all  studied  LEDs 

had very good repetitiveness. Here we have presented typical results.  

Unfortunately  it  should  be  noted  here  that  for  the  NICHIA  ultra  bright  blue 

LEDs, even for the same NSPB300 or NSPB500 type of LEDs, only the “old” ones 

produced in the  middle  of 1990s  show  very  fast  light  emission  kinetics.  One can 

see in Fig.6 the NICHIA NSPB500S LEDs light pulses profiles measured with the 

set-up described above. It is clearly seen that there are two batches of LEDs. The 

 

6 

a

a
first “fast” group consists of LEDs bought in 1995-96 (we call them “old” LEDs) 

and the second one corresponds to LEDs bought in 2002-03 (“new” LEDs). As to 

the  KINGBRIGHT  ultra  bright  blue  LEDs  family  only  LEDs  with  NBC  mark 

extension  –  L7113NBC  and  L-53NBC,  which  are  unfortunately  obsolete  and 

presently not available, demonstrate fast light emission kinetics similar to kinetics 

of the NICHIA  “old” LEDs. New  LEDs presently available from KINGBRIGHT 

(e.g. L7113PBC and L-53PBC) are conspicuously slower as it can be seen in Fig.7. 

It  is  beyond  the  scope  of  the  present  work  to  discuss  the  causes  of  such  drastic 

changes in the LEDs light emission kinetics. It will be discussed more thoroughly 

elsewhere [17].

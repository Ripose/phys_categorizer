Abstract 
 

This paper reviews resent theoretical and experimental research on physical processes 
in  compensated  negative-ion  beams.  A  previous  review  was  published  by  one  of  the 
authors  in  Ref.  [1].  The  present  paper  summarizes  the  new  results  of  numerical 
calculations of the stationary electric field in negative-ion beams, and the resent results of 
experimental studies of suppression of ion-ion instability at low gas pressures. 

As in Ref. [1], the review addresses the following three main issues of the physics of 

compensated beams: 
1)  Spatial charge compensation in steady beams; 
2)  Dynamic decompensation of spatial charge, which occurs as a result of beam current 

modulation due to plasma instabilities in the ion source; 

3)  Collective processes. 

The  results  presented  in  this  review  enable  one  to  determine  how  non-compensated 
spatial charge, nonresonant oscillations of the beam current, and collective oscillations of 
the  ion-beam  plasma  influence  the  propagation  properties  of  the  beam.  With  this 
information, one can determine the optimal ion transportation parameters. 
 
Introduction 
 

Intense ion beams have large spatial charges. Consequently, ion transport is possible 
only if their charges are compensated by charges of the opposite sign. For negative ion 
beams,  the  spatial  charge  compensation  can  be  achieved  using  positive  ions  that  are 
produced  by  ionization  of  a  neutral  gas.  In  the  process  of  the  ionization,  the  beam 
becomes  a  two-  or  three-component  quasi-neutral  medium  that  is  commonly  called  an 
0n ,  of  neutral  gas  particles,  an  ionization 
ion-beam  plasma.  For  a  given  concentration,
iσ , and   an ion velocity,  v− , the time of  ionization, τ, can be estimated to 
.  The  introduction  of  the  compensating  component  mainly  solves  the 
be

problem of the spatial charge neutralization and, consequently, the problem of the beam 
transport. However, while the transport properties of a single-component beam are easily 
calculated  using  numerical  techniques,  the  analysis  of  the  multi-component  system  is 
rather  complicated.  Thorough  experiments  and  numerical  simulations  are  required  to

investigate the transport properties of multi-component ion beams. This research has been 
systematically performed at the Institute of Physics of National Academy of Sciences of 
the Ukraine for many years.  For convenience, we have subdivided the results obtained 
into the following three parts: 

 

1)  The spatial charge compensation of a steady ion beam; 
2)  The dynamic decompensation of the beam occurring as a result of current modulation 

by nonresonant oscillations; 

3)  The collective processes in an ion-beam plasma. 
 
I. Spatial charge compensation in a steady ion beam 
 

The  main  difference  between  intense  beams  of  negative  ions  and  intense  beams  of 
positive  ions  is  that  negative  ion  compensation  is  performed  by  heavy  positive  ions. 
Consequently, the spatial charge of the negative ion beam may be overcompensated. (For 
positive  ion  beams  overcompensation  is  possible  only  in  the  presence  of  external 
magnetic field.) This phenomenon of the spatial charge overcompensation is observed at 
gas  pressure, p ,  that  exceeds  a  critical  value, 
crp .  The  related  critical  concentration  of 
neutral particles, and, consequently, the critical pressure, can be easily determined from 
the balance equations written at this pressure for electrons and plasma ions:

For  optimal  negative  ion  transport  over  noticeable  distances,  one  must  evaluate  the 
electric field within the beam for both of these regimes. Let us first consider the regime 
of high pressure. In Ref. [2] the radial voltage drop, ϕ∆ , (which is unambiguously related 
to the average radial electric field) was determined using the equation of electron balance

eT  is the plasma electron temperature. 

 
where 
 
Usually, this equation rather adequately describes the real system because the lifetime of  
the  free  electrons  significantly  exceeds  the  time  of  the  electron-electron  collisions,  and 
the  distribution  function  of  the  electrons  has  sufficient  time  to  reach  equilibrium  (the 
Boltzman’s  distribution).  However,  from  this  equation  one  can  obtain  only  the  relation 
between  ϕ∆  and 
ekT , and  ϕ∆  are 
ekT . It is not a solution of the problem because both 
undefined  parameters.  In  Ref.  [3]  an  equation  of  the  energy  balance  for  compensating 
electrons  is  proposed  to  use  for  determination  of  the  value   ϕ∆ .  It  is  assumed  that  the 
compensating electrons are slow electrons trapped in potential well of the beam, whereas 
electrons whose energy is sufficient to overcome the potential barrier,  e ϕ∆ ,  rush out of 
the beam, and their contribution to the spatial charge can be neglected. 
 
The authors of Ref. [3] focused their attention on the following phenomenon. On the one 
hand,  compensating  electrons,  which  experience  multiple  oscillations  in  potential  well, 
cannot leave the beam because of insufficient energies. On the other hand, they have to 
leave  the  beam  in  the  course  of  time  to  prevent  a  permanent  accumulation  of  the  slow 
electrons otherwise the stationary state of the system should not be realized. Thus, some 
energy  source  heats  up  the  trapped  electrons  (in  the  absence  of  such  a  source,  the  well 
depth  would  equal  to  zero).  The  beam  itself  provides  this  energy  source.  Coulomb 
collisions or different collective processes may cause the energy transfer from the beam 
ions  to  the  electrons.  To  find  a  minimal  value  for  ∆ϕ    one  should  consider  only  the 
Coulomb collisions.

When  being  heated  up,  each  trapped  electron  accumulates  energy  rather  gradually 
through the  long-rang electron-ions forces acting within the Debye sphere, in opposite to 
neutral  molecules,  for  example,  energies  of  which  can  change  step-wise  in  time  due  to  
the short-rang forces acting by collisions of the molecules with each other. As soon as the 
kinetic  energy  of  an  electron  reaches  the  well  depth,  the  electron  will  leave  the  beam 
quickly, and so its velocity vanishes out of the beam.  This circumstance enables to write

Given the parameters of both the beam and the gas, one can calculate the ϕ∆ .  
 
It is  to be  noticed  that  the  heated  electrons do not  carry out  any  energy  from  the beam 
when overcoming the barrier e ϕ∆  because their kinetic energy transforms to the electric 
field energy. This accumulated energy is converted to the kinetic energy of positive ions, 
which follow the electrons to establish a stationary state of the beam. Finally, the positive 
ions produced by gas ionization are particles that transport energy from the beam.  
 
The  authors  of  Ref.  [4]  have  a  different  opinion  on  the  physical  mechanisms  that  are 
responsible for the  formation of  a  steady state. With the objective of  determining  these 
mechanisms,  we  have  numerically  investigated  the  process  of  establishing  the  steady-
state  taking  into  account  the  Coulomb  collisions  both  between  beam  ions  and  plasma 
electrons and between beam ions and positive plasma ions.  The ion-electron collisions

with the experimental data is obtained when the electron distribution function is assumed 
to be Maxwellian, and the energy of the positive ions is vanishingly small. Because the 
electrons and the positive ions are being heated by the beam ions, the linear momenta of 
these particles are changed in our calculation scheme at each time step according to the

The corresponding stationary electron energy distribution (See Fig.3) proves to be close

distribution that serves as a basis for the approximate energy balance (6). Finally, Fig.4 
shows the dependencies of the potential at the beam center (curve 1) and the voltage drop 
(curve 2)  on  the  beam  current  density, j− .  Both  of  these  dependencies  are  close  to

Now let us consider results of calculations at pressures lower than critical one. In this 
case  the  equilibrium  potential  in  the  beam  is  negative,  and  its  minimum  value  is 
determined  by  Coulomb  interaction  between  the  negative  ions  of  the  beam  and  the 
positive  ions  of  the  plasma.  Due  to  large  mass  of  the  positive  ions,  Coulomb  heating 
occurs with small efficiency, and thus values of negative potential are small. Particularly,

A  schema  of  the  experimental  setup  for  research  on  the  spatial  charge  compensation  is 
shown in Fig.5. The ion source is based on the reflective discharge. After the extractor 2, 
the  H − -ions enter the magnetic field 3 whose strength is 2 kO . Finally, the magnetic lens 
5  forms  the  beam  6  which  propagates  through  the  metal  chamber  to  the  target  10.  The 
chamber  diameter  is  ~ 40 cm.  The  beam  current  in  the  chamber  does  not  exceed  6mA,

qualitative  agreement  with  the  estimate  (3).  The  measured  values  of  the  potential 
are  close  to  the  numerical  results  at  high  pressures.    However,  there  is  considerable 
discrepancy  between  these  data  at  low  pressures.  The  reasons  why  the  experimental 
values are essentially lower than the calculated ones are discussed in the next section.

The  points  in  Fig.  7  demonstrate  the  experimentally  obtained  dependence  of  the 
voltage drop ∆ϕ on the beam current density at high pressures. The solid lines present the 
dependencies  that  result  from  the  estimate  (7)  for  air  and  xenon.  Taking  into 
consideration the good agreement among the experimental (see Fig. 6 and 7), numerical 
(Fig.1-4), and approximate data (estimates (3) and (7)) we unambiguously conclude that: 

1.  It is the Coulomb collisions of the beam ions with the plasma electrons that define the 
degree of  the  overcompensation  of the  spatial  charge  in negative ion beams  at  high 
gas pressure. 

2.  The  qualitative  estimates  of  the  overcompensation  based  on  the  energy  balance 
equation for the trapped electrons (see Ref. [1, 3]), yield results that are close to the 
experimental and numerical data. 

3.  The  results  reported  in  [4]  are  incorrect  because  of  an  erroneously  written  energy 

balance. 

 
II.  Dynamic  decompensation  of  the  beam  due  to  current  modulation  by 
nonresonant oscillations 
 

As noted in the previous section, the experimentally measured potential 

 is 
about  2  orders  of  magnitude  higher  than  that  obtained  in  our  numerical  model  for 
.  Dynamic  effects  can  be  naturally  assumed  to  play  a  more  significant

role in this case.

The  simplest  of  these  is  a  decompensation  due  to  nonresonant  oscillations  of  the 
current  caused  by  instabilities  of  the  ion  source  plasma.  Let 
be  the 
beam current and let the amplitude α of the current oscillations be constant in time. If 
the frequency ω is high enough, so that the quantity of compensating particles (positive 
ions)  created  in  the  beam  per  half-cycle,

of  amplitude  of  the  alternating  potential  by  means  of  special  capacitive  probes  have 
shown that there exist oscillations in the system, the amplitudes of which are close to the 
potentials  measured  by  the  incandescent  probe  in  Ref.  [1,3].  Therefore,  the  dynamic 
decompensation  for  our  experiments  is  certain  to  be  determined  by  the  nonresonant 
oscillations of the beam current. 

III. Collective processes in the intense beams of negative ions 

 
Collective oscillations in intense negative ion beams have a number of peculiarities in 
comparison with both electron beams and positive ion beams. However, as observed in 
both  of  these  beam  systems,  two  oscillation  branches  are  excited  in  the  system  under 
study as well: electron (high frequency) and ion (low frequency) oscillations. 

Unlike  the  case  of  current  oscillations  considered  in  the  previous  section,  the 
collective  oscillations  are  excited  either  in  the  beam  itself,  or  (if  perturbations  at 
respective frequencies occur in the ion source plasma) these intensify in the drift space of 
the beam. In both cases, the oscillation amplitudes grow exponentially in the direction of 
the beam propagation (in the space surrounding the ion beam) during the initial stage of 
the  instability  development,  which  is  described  by  linear  equations.  As  the  amplitude 
increases,  nonlinear  effects  limit  the  growth.    Steady-state  oscillations  with  large 
amplitudes  can  essentially  modify  the  following  beam  transport  properties:  the  angular 
divergence, the degree of space charge compensation, and the beam emittance. 

One  of  the  authors  of  the  present  review  studied  in  detail  both  the  linear  and  the 
nonlinear stages of ion and electron oscillations in the plasma formed by the negative ion 
beam.  The  main  characteristics  of  the  linear  oscillations  (frequencies  and  space 
increments) and the main nonlinear mechanisms that limit the instability amplitudes were 
determined. A full summary of these researches is given in [1]. 

The  most  important  practical  conclusion,  which  results  from  above  mentioned 
researches,  is  that  the  electron  oscillations  in  the  plasma  for  a  wide  range  of  pressures, 
and  ion  oscillations  in  the  plasma  at  pressures  greater  than  the  critical  pressure,  do  not

lead to serious beam transport problems. These cause just a  relatively small increase in 
the emittance and the degree of decompensation, which results in a minor increase of the 
beam angular divergence.  

A  different  situation  occurs  for  gas  pressures  lower  than 0crp ,  when  the  system  is 
practically two-component and consists of negative ions of the beam and positive ions of 
the  plasma  that  partially  compensate  the  beam  space  charge.  Electrons  created  by  the 
ionization are repelled by the electric field; hence, their concentration is lower by several 
orders of magnitude than the ion concentration. The role of electrons in the development 
of  ion  oscillations  in  the  plasma  is  known  to  be  extremely  important.  These  electrons 
shield  the  charge  of  all  long-wave  oscillations  and  enable  intensification  of  those 
ed ,  of  the  electrons. 
oscillations  whose  wavelengths  are  less  than  the  Debye  radius, 
Because  the  Debye  radius  usually  exceeds  the  beam  radius  at  low  pressures,  electrons 
cannot  shield  even  the  most  long-wave  perturbations  (in  radially-limited  systems  the 
longest  wavelength  does  not  exceed  the  doubled  beam  diameter).  This  circumstance, 
r> , is not principal for the linear stage of the instability when its increment is weakly 
ed
dependent on the wavelength. It does become important for the nonlinear stage because 
of the significant charge separation in the ion waves. Actually, estimates of the nonlinear 
effects indicate that the maximum amplitude of the electric field is proportional to total 
space charge per wavelength; consequently, the maximum amplitude of the potential in 
the  wave  is  proportional  to  the  wavelength  squared.  Therefore,  ratio  between  the 
maximum amplitude in the system at low pressures (when electrons are absent) and that 
at high pressures (when electrons are present) is(

The peculiarities of the ion oscillations observed at low pressures have been studied

A  convincing demonstration  that  the  ion  oscillations  mainly  determine  the  potential

  is  given  in  Fig.9.  This  figure  presents  the  flow  of  the  positive 
ions to the chamber sidewall as function of the pressure p . The flow was measured at two 
different distances, Z , from the beam entrance to the chamber (See the curves 1 and 2). 
One  can  see  that,  in  the  region  of  the  small  amplitudes  of  the  voltage  oscillations, 
, these flows are about equal because they are only determined by the ionization 
n
rate  in  the  measurement  area.  In  contrast,  in  region  II,
,  the  flow  at  the  shorter 
distance  (curve  1)  is  considerably  less  than  that  at  the  larger  distance  (curve  2). 
Undoubtedly, the reason is that the ion oscillation amplitude sharply increases along the 
beam at low pressures to intensify the radial ion flow.

The  experimental  results  presented  show  that  at  low  gas  pressures  ion  oscillations 
may have catastrophic influence on the beam transport. The extent of the influence grows 
as the beam current increases. One can easily see that the beam of  H −  ions whose current

Thus,  for  intense  beam  transport,  the  gas  pressure  has  to  be  higher  than  the  critical 
.  However,  this  criterion  is  sometimes  hard  to  achieve 
value, 
because of the ion loss at high gas pressures due to the intense charge exchange. In this 
case, one can use the suppression of the ion-ion instability proposed in Ref. [6]. The idea 
of  this  instability  suppression  is  that  the  electrons  are  forcedly  injected  into  the  beam 
from a thermo emitter in order to shield the electric field of the nascent ion-ion waves.

Fig.10 shows the scheme of the setup for this suppression.  A beam of  H − -ions with

current  ~ 50 
Magnetic  field  of  up  to  2kO   created  by  the permanent  magnets  2  bends  and  forms  the 
beam. In the straight section, the beam propagates inside the two solenoids with currents 
of opposite directions. These solenoids form the cusp magnetic field to hold electrons in 
the  beam.  The  beam  collector  6  is  a  tantalum  plate  with  holes  each  having  a  0.3 mm 
diameter and placed with 5 mm spacing in the corners of squares. Images of the beams 
passing through the holes and falling on the luminescent screen 7 are used to measure the 
beam emittance. The electron emitter 9 is a tungsten thread heated by an electric current. 
The  voltage  between  the  emitter  and  the  chamber,  and  the  emission  current  are 
about ~ 150V and  ~ 250mA  correspondingly.  The neutral gas in the chamber is argon. 

The oscillograms of the column 1 in Fig. 11 demonstrate the potential oscillations for 
different  gas  pressures  when  the  instability  develops  in  the  ion-ion  plasma.  After  the 
emitter  is  turned  on,  the  instability  is  suppressed  by  other  equal  conditions  (See  the 
oscillograms of the column 2 as contrasted to the column 1). One can see that injection of 
  results  in  reducing  the  oscillation  amplitudes  to 
electrons  for

Suppression  of  the  instability  leads  to  a  significant  voltage  decrease  (that  is, 
decompensation  degree)  that  decreases  the  emittance  and  the  angular divergence  of  the 
beam. 
 

Conclusions 
 

of Ukraine are as follows: 

 

The results of our research at the Institute of Physics of National Academy of Science 

1.  Approximate  analytical  expressions  based  on  the  energy  balance  for  the  plasma 
electrons  and  ions  have  been  obtained  to  evaluate  the  minimal  electric  field  in  the 
compensated negative ion beams for different gas pressures. 

 
2.  Numerical calculations of the steady state of the beams have been performed using a 
PIC-code. The Coulomb collisions of the negative ions with the plasma electrons (at 
high pressures) and the plasma ions (at low pressures) were shown to determine the 
physical mechanisms forming the equilibrium state.

3.  Experiments using an  H − -ion beam reveal that the radial electric fields measured at 
high  gas  pressures  are  close  to  both  the  numerical  data  and  the  estimated  values. 
However, at low gas pressures, instabilities in the ion source and the beam plasma can 
cause  the  dynamical  beam  decompensation  which  increases  the  extent  of  the 
decompensation as compared with our numerical results. 

 
4.  The ion-ion oscillation  can  have catastrophic influence on the beam transport at low 
pressures. One method of suppression of this instability is proposed and demonstrated 
in experiments with the intense beams of  H − ions. The idea of this method is that the 
electrons forcedly injected to the beam plasma shield the electric field of the nascent 
ion-ion waves to prevent their growth.

Abstract. Imposing start from the beginning that the incidence and the reflection of a ray t on an 
arbitrarily orientated mirror take place at the same point in space and at the same zero time in all involved 
reference frames in relative motion, we decompose the reflection in two aberration of light effects, of the 
incident and of the reflected rays respectively.  
 

 
1. Introduction 
The  reflection  of  a  plane-polarized  wave  on  a  moving  mirror  is  associated  with  the 
 
aberration of light effect.1,2,3,4,5,6. It is known that the formulas that account for aberration can be 
derived  from 
the  Lorentz-Einstein 
transformations6.  Most of the papers covering this topics deal with the case of a vertical mirror 
the plane of which is normal to the direction in which it moves. 
 
The purpose of our paper is to consider the general case of an arbitrary orientated 
mirror. Figure 1 shows a plane-polarized light wave incident on a plane mirror. The mirror is at 
rest in the K’(X’O’Y’) inertial reference frame. One of the incidence points coincides with the 
origin  O’  and  takes  place  at  a  time  t’=0,  generating  the  event 
  that  is 
characterized  by  the  same  space-time  coordinates  in  all  inertial  reference  frames  in    relative 
uniform motion. In the rest frame of the mirror, the angles of incidence and reflection are equal 
to each other and equal to 
 
The  problem  is  to  find  a  relationship  between  the  angle  of  incidence  i  and  the 
angle of reflection r both measured in  the K(XOY) reference frame, relative to which K’ moves 
with constant velocity V in the positive direction of the common OX(O’X’) axes. The axes of the 
two  reference  frames  are  parallel  to  each  other  and  at  the  origin  of  time  in  the  two  frames 
(t=t’=0)  the  origins  O  and  O’  are  located  at  the  same  point  in  space.  The  condition  imposed 
above makes that in both reference frames incidence and reflection take place at the same point 
in space and at the same time. 
 
Even if it is considered that the use of the Lorentz-Einstein transformations when 
we derive for relativistic phenomena is straightforward but not very transparent from the point of 
view of physics7 we will use them, carefully defining the space-time coordinates of the involved 
events.

coordinates

Equation (7) is a genuine transformation equation, containing in its left hand side only physical 
quantities measured in K whereas in its right hand side only physical quantities measured in  K’. 
From a practical point of view it enables observers from K’ to describe the reflection in K as a 
function of physical quantities measured in theirs own reference frame.

therefore,  reflection  law,  as  a  true  law  of  nature,  holds  in  all  inertial  reference  frames.  In 
accordance with the principle of relativity it should hold for all values of 
 mainly because as 
detected  from  K  the  mirror  rotates  in  such  a  way  that  the  reflection  law  is  preserved.  As 
customary in special relativity its formulas depend on the direction of the relative velocity and on 
the  direction  in  which  the  rays  of  light  propagate.  Changing  the  direction  of  relative  motion

3. Does the reflection law work in all inertial reference frames? 
We have shown so far that the reflection law works in the case of a horizontal mirror in 
 
all  inertial  reference  frames  in  relative  motion.  Consider  a  ray  that  propagates  parallel  to  the 

surface of the mirror 

 when detected from K’, where it is not deflected by the mirror. 

When  detected  from  K  that  ray  propagates  along  a  direction  that  makes  an  angle 
positive direction of the common OX(O’X’) axes, given by

4. Conclusions 
 
 
We have shown that imposing a certain initial condition, we can reduce the reflection of 
light on a plane mirror to the aberration of two rays that propagate in a given inertial reference 
frame symmetrically with respect to the common axes but in opposite direction.

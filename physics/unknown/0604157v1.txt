We  discover  multipole-mode  solitons  supported  by  the  surface  between  two  distinct 

periodic  lattices  imprinted  in  Kerr-type  nonlinear  media.  Such  solitons  are  possible 

because  the  refractive  index  modulation  at  both  sides  of  the  interface  glues  together 

their  out-of-phase  individual  constituents.  Remarkably,  we  find  that  the  new  type  of 

solitons  may  feature  highly  asymmetric  shapes  and  yet  they  are  stable  over  wide 

domains of their existence, a rare property to be attributed to their surface nature.

Nonlinear periodic structures, or optical lattices, may support stable solitons that 

have  no  analogue,  or  that  are  highly  unstable,  in  uniform  nonlinear  media.  Salient 

examples  include  scalar  gap,  vortex,  and  multipole-mode  solitons.  Recent  achievements 

in optical lattice induction [1-4] enabled experimental observation of such solitons. Thus, 

the properties of vortex lattice solitons were analyzed in Ref. [5] and their experimental 

observation  was  reported  in  [6,7].  Another  interesting  class  of  solutions,  i.e.  multipole-

mode  solitons,  was  studied  theoretically  in  Refs.  [8,9]  and  observed  experimentally  in 

[10,11]. Bessel optical lattices also support stable multipole-mode solitons [12-14]. It was 

recently predicted and verified experimentally that nonlinear interfaces between periodic 

structures  and  uniform  media  also  support  solitons  [15-17].  Such  surface  solitons  are 

located  at  the  very  interface  and  their  properties  depend  crucially  on  the  ratio  of 

refractive  index  of  the  uniform  medium  and  mean  refractive  index  of  the  periodic 

structure.  Suitable  periodic  structures  with  engineered  properties  can  be  made  in 

waveguide  arrays  with  technologies  currently  available,  and  optical  induction  of  the 

lattices is a potential future alternative. The power level required for existence of surface 

solitons  at  such  interfaces  may  be  substantially  reduced  in  comparison  with  that  for 

interfaces  of  uniform  media  (see  Refs.  [18,19]  for  reviews)  because  of  tunable,  shallow

refractive  index  modulations  which  are  possible  in  optically-induced  lattices  or 

waveguide arrays. Recently, gap surface solitons were predicted [20] and experimentally 

observed [21]. New types of interfaces can be produced by different lattices, opening new 

possibilities for exploration. In this Letter we consider the interface between two periodic 

lattices and show that they support multipole-mode solitons that have no analogues in 

uniform  materials.  In  contrast  to  multipole-mode  solitons  in  infinite  periodic  lattices, 

surface multipole solitons feature strongly asymmetric shapes. Yet, we found them to be 

stable  in  wide  domains  of  their  existence.  Our  findings  constitute  the  first  known 

example of a nontrivial soliton structure guided by a surface. 

We  thus  address  beam  propagation  at  the  interface  produced  by  two  lattices 

imprinted in a focusing medium with Kerr-type saturable nonlinearity, governed by the 

nonlinear Schrödinger equation for dimensionless complex amplitude of light field q :

possibility  of  tuning  the  properties  of  the  interface.  The  model  (1)  holds  also  for 

nonlinear  media  with  an  imprinted  refractive  index  modulation  (see  Ref.  [22,23]  for

The  simplest  asymmetric  multipole-mode  solitons  supported  by  the  interface 

consist  of  two  bright  spots  with  π   phase-jump  between  them  that  are  located  at 

different  sides  of  the  interface  (Fig.  1).  Notice  that  such  solitons  cannot  exist  at  the 

interface  between  uniform  materials  because  of  repulsive  forces  acting  between  out-of-

phase spots. Periodic refractive index modulation can compensate repulsive forces acting 

between  out-of-phase  soliton  constituents  even  if  they  have  different  peak  amplitudes 

and results in multipole soliton formation. Importantly, despite the fact that topological 

(phase) structure of multipole surface solitons is similar to that for multipole solitons in 

periodic lattices [8,9] and twisted unstaggered modes in waveguide arrays introduced in 

[24] and further classified in [25], their intensity distribution can be strongly asymmetric, 

since lattices forming the interface require different peak powers for self-sustained light 

beam propagation for a given propagation constant  b . The energy flow of dipole-mode 

surface  soliton  is  a  non-monotonic  function  of  propagation  constant  (Fig.  2(a)).  We 

found that U  diverges as b  approaches cutoff b , and that far from the cutoff U  grows 

co

with  b . In clear contrast to multipole solitons in usual periodic lattices [8,9], right spot 

of surface soliton strongly expands over the lattice at  η

0>

 and 

maxq η> → 0 , while

its  left  spot  remains  well  localized  as  b

  (Fig.  1(a)).  The  asymmetry  in  soliton 

profile becomes less pronounced with increase of b  (Fig. 2(a)). 

A similar behavior was encountered for other types of multipole surface solitons, 

including quadrupole ones, that consist of two bright spots in the region 

η ≤

0

 and two 

spots at  η

0>

, while soliton phase changes by 

π

 between different quadrants of  (

plane  (Figs.  1(c)  and  1(d)).  The  power  distribution  W U

  defined  as  the  ratio 

between the power U  localized at  η

 and the power U  localized at  η

as

l

W

  characterizes  the  degree  of  asymmetry  of  light  intensity  distribution  of  surface 

soliton.  Notice  the  clearly  pronounced  minimum  in  the  dependence W b .  Figure  1(c) 

(

shows  that W   decreases  with  increase  of  the  height 

pδ

  of  step  in  refractive  index, 

min

which indicates progressive asymmetry growth. 

We found that for fixed lattice depth cutoff b  increases almost linearly with  δ

.  Importantly,  linear  stability  analysis  revealed  that  surface  solitons  become 

completely  stable  when  propagation  constant  exceeds  a  critical  value  b

cob

.  The 

width  of  instability  domain  remains  almost  unchanged  with  increase  of 

,  i.e.  with 

cr >
pδ

increase  of  asymmetry  in  soliton  profile  (Fig.  2(d)),  and  it  decreases  with  increase  of 

lattice depth 

p

 (Fig. 2(e)). Thus even moderate periodic refractive index modulation can 

stabilize highly asymmetric multipole surface solitons. We found that similarly to weakly-

localized twisted modes in waveguide arrays [24], the largest part of instability domain 

for surface multipole solitons is associated with oscillatory instabilities (Re

δ
( ) I

δ
m ≠
( )

0)

, 

while  close  to  cutoff  surface  solitons  are  exponentially  unstable  (Fig.  2(f)).  Notice  that 

oscillatory  instability  in  the  low-power  limit  is  a  characteristic  signature  of  multipole 

solitons existing in different physical systems. Increasing the lattice depth suppresses the 

instability and it is accompanied by reduction of maximal value of  Re

( )δ

. 

The results of linear stability analysis were fully confirmed by direct simulations 

of  Eq.  (1).  We  used  input  conditions  with

the  region  η

  and  formation  of  soliton  in  the  region 

η ≤

0

.  Simulations  show  that 

asymmetric  surface  solitons  can  be  excited  by  Gaussian  beams  with  properly  selected 

amplitudes  and  phases,  which  confirms  the  robustness  of  the  solitons.  Finally,  besides 

dipole  and  quadrupole  solitons,  we  have  also  found  a  variety  of  more  complex  stable 

asymmetric solitons (not shown here) supported by the interface between two lattices. 

Summarizing,  we  have  reported  on  the  first  known  example  of  stable,  nontrivial 

soliton structures guided an interface between two optical lattices. We found that such 

solitons  can  be  stable  and  robust  in  lattices  with  moderate  depths  even  if  they  feature 

highly  asymmetric  profiles.  The  setting  explored  can  be  implemented  experimentally 

with  optical-induction  and  in  suitable  waveguide  arrays,  and  hence  it  opens  a  route  to 

the observation of rich variety of nonlinear surface waves, at reduced power levels.

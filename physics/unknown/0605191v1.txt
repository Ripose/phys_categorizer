Abstract:  In  this  paper,  we  numerically  demonstrate  a  near-infrared  negative-index 

metamaterial (NIM) slab consisting of multiple layers of perforated metal-dielectric stacks 

and exhibiting low imaginary part of index over the wavelength of negative refraction. The 

effective  index  is  obtained  using  two  different  numerical  methods  and  found  to  be 

consistent.  Backward  phase  propagation  is  verified  by  calculation  of  fields  inside  the 

metamaterial. These results point to a new design of low loss thick metamaterial at optical 

frequencies.  

More than 40 years ago, Veselago proposed many unconventional phenomena for a medium with 

negative  refractive  index,  as  well  as  the  application  of  a  NIM  slab  as  an  imaging  lens.[1] 

Recently, Pendry took a step further and claimed that the NIM slab can magnify the evanescent 

field and work as a perfect lens. [2] This, as well as the first experimental demonstration of an 

artificial NIM in the microwave region, [3] led to numerous efforts in this research topic.

In the last two years, there has been much progress towards the realization of negative-

index metamaterial (NIM) at optical frequencies. This includes the numerical studies on infrared 

magnetic  metamaterials  and  NIMs  [4,  5,  6]  and  experimental  demonstration  of  THz,  mid-

infrared and near-infrared magnetic metamaterials [7, 8, 9, 10, 11] as well as near-infrared NIMs. 

[12,  13]  The  experimentally  demonstrated  near-IR  NIMs  in  Ref.  [12,  13]  exhibit  very  large 

imaginary part of index, which make them not very suitable for real applications. To reduce the 

loss  and  enhance  the  transmission,  more  optimized  structures  similar  to  that  in  Ref  [12]  were 

numerically  studied  and  experimentally  verified.  [14,  15]    As  shown  in  Ref.  [14],  a  thin 

metamaterial (<<) slab consisting of metal/dielectric/metal multiple layers with periodic array 

of holes exhibits negative refractive index at near-infrared wavelengths. This thin metamaterial 

slab is considered as a basic artificial molecule of negative-index metamateiral and can be used 

as  a  building  block  to  construct  a  much  thicker  metamaterial  (~),  so  that  more  interesting 

phenomena  can  be  studied.  Furthermore,  the  question  as  to  how  the  optical  properties  of  a 

metamaterial  consisting  of  many  unit  cells  differ  from  that  of  a  single  unit  cell  is  frequently 

asked, a numerical study of the metamaterial with unit cells ranging from one to many will not 

only  answer  this  question,  but  also  give  us  more  insight  into  the  design  of  negative  index 

metamaterials at optical frequencies. 

As  shown  in  Ref.  [14,  16],  an  array  of  metallic  stripe  pairs  along  the  direction  of 

magnetic field vertically separated by a dielectric layer exhibits strong magnetic resonance with 

negative effective permeability over a certain wavelength range. The resonance wavelength has a 

linear relation with the stripe linewidth. Adding an array of metallic stripes along the direction of 

electric field to this magnetic structure resulting in metal/dielectric/metal films with 2D array of 

square  holes  perforating  the  multiple  layers.  Reduced  surface  plasma  frequency  in  perforated 

2

metal films has been proposed and experimentally verified. [17, 18] Thus, by a careful design, a 

moderately  negative  permittivity  can  be  achieved,  which,  in  combination  with  the  magnetic 

response,  leads  to  negative  refractive  index.  The  schematic  of  the  thick  metamaterial  structure 

simulated in this paper is shown in Fig. 1 with all the geometric parameters shown in the figure.

Rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA) was used for the simulation.[19] To extract the 

refractive  index  of  this  structure,  two  different  methods  are  carried  out.  The  first  one  is  the 

determination  of  the  effective  index  with  the  complex  coefficients  of  transmission  and 

reflectance on a metamaterial slab. In this method, the inverse of a cosine function is involved, 

which  causes  ambiguity  due  to  the  multiple  branches  of  it.  To  resolve  the  ambiguity, 

metamaterials with different number of unit cells are simulated; the branch that is consistent for 

different numbers of unit cells is chosen as the root, as described in Ref. [20] 

For light propagating in a periodic structure, infinite numbers of modes exist for a given 

frequency (each mode is the linear combination of many plane waves based on the periodicity in 

the  transverse  directions),  while  most  of  them  decay  very  quickly  and  can  be  ignored.  As  the 

number  of  unit  cell  along  the  wave  propagation  direction  gets  larger,  only  the  one  with  the 

smallest  imaginary  part  dominates.  [21]  Based  on  this  consideration,  the  second  method  is  to 

solve  the  eigenvalues  of  the  transfer  matrix  for  a  single  unit  cell,  the  mode  with  the  smallest 

decay dominates and effective index associated with this mode is obtained. 

In RCWA, the electromagnetic fields are expanded into a spatial Fourier series based on 

the period of the structures in the transverse directions. Suppose inside the periodic structures the 

forward and backward propagating light have spatial Fourier coefficients Amn, Bmn, where m and 

n are the diffraction orders in x and y directions, the electrical field associated with the forward

and  backward  propagation  can  be  summed  over  all  the  spatial  components.  For  instance,  the 

electric field of the forward propagating beams can be expressed as:

. Here the same number of diffraction orders (2N+1) are kept in 

both directions [a total number of (2N+1)2], with m and n ranging from (-N) to N. (N is limited 

by the computing power, here N=9).  represents the polarization, TE or TM. 

By  using  RCWA,  the  transmission  matrix  can  be  obtained  numerically  for  a  periodic 

structure, which relates the coefficient vector Amn, Bmn (before the unit cell) and A’mn, B’mn (after 

the unit cell) by,

Where M is a transfer matrix of dimension 4(2N+1)2, which is calculated based on the Fourier 

transform of the dielectric function along the transverse directions. Next, the eigenvalues of the 

matrix M can be solved as q, where q is from 1 to 4(2N+1)2, only half of the eigenvalues with 

modulus larger than 1 represent the physical propagating modes, with each mode being the linear 

combination  of  all  the spatial harmonics.  When  light  propagates through  many  unit  cells,  only 

the fundamental one with the smallest || (smallest loss) dominates, e.g. the mode with || closest 

to 1. Thus, the effective index can be expressed as:

In equation (5) and (6), d is the thickness of a single unit cell along the propagation.

We first numerically calculate the transmission and reflectance for one, two, five, six and 

ten  layers  of  unit  cells  with  both  the  incident  and  exit  media  as  air.  The  transmission  and 

reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 3. For a single layer, the transmission shows a dip around 2 

m  and  a  peak  around  1.93  m.  With  increasing  number  of  layers,  the  transmission  at  long 

wavelength (>1.93 m) decrease rapidly and approaching zero. For multiple layers of unit cells, 

over the wavelength below 1.95 m, the T and R oscillate with the wavelength, characteristic of 

a pass band with finite thickness, which is the negative index region, as will be shown later. With 

the dimension of unit cell along the propagation being 130 nm, the thickness of the slab with ten 

unit  cells  is  only  1.3  m,  which  is  less  than  the  wavelength  of  interest.  However,  as  many as 

eight resonant peaks are observed over the pass band from 1.5 m to 1.95 m. As will be shown 

later, the large number of resonances is due to the rapid increase of absolute value of effective 

index with wavelength over the negative refraction region.

Next, the effective indices of structures with different thicknesses are calculated using the 

complex coefficients of transmission and reflectance, as shown in Fig. 4. For a single unit cell, 

the real part of index is continuous and negative from 1.77 to 2.18 m, the imaginary part shows 

a peak around 2  m. For multiple numbers of unit cells, the negative refraction starts from 1.5 

m, the indices decrease quickly with wavelength to ~-8 at 2 m. Over this negative index range, 

the real part of index for two to ten layers agrees well and the imaginary part of index for five to 

5

ten layers converges nicely and is very small over the range from 1.5 to 1.7 m (less than 0.1 for 

ten layer unit cells). As mentioned before, the inverse method involves finding root for a cosine 

function,  which  has  infinite  branches.  As  shown  in  Fig.  4,  real  part  of  effective  index  along 

branch 1 is consistent for different numbers of unit cell up to 2 m, when wavelength is longer 

than  2  m,  the  branch  1  starts  to  diverge  for  different  layers.  However,  we  can  find  another 

branch, e.g. branch 2 as shown in Fig. 4, which is consistent for different numbers of unit cells. 

Although there is a large discontinuity between branch 1 and branch 2 at 2 m, however, to meet 

the requirement that the refractive index has to be consistent for different number of unit cells of 

metamaterial,  we  need  to  accept  these  two  branches  at  different  wavelength  regions.  For 

wavelength  over  2  m  (branch  2  is  chosen),  the  real  part  of  index  is  almost  zero  and  the 

imaginary  part  is  much  larger  than  the  real  part,  exhibiting  metallic  properties.  Compared  to 

single unit cell, the imaginary part is low and flat over this long wavelength range. 

Discontinuity  of  refractive  index  with  respect  to  wavelength  does  not  occur  in  natural 

materials.  To  better  understand  this  discontinuity,  the  second  method,  a  modal  analysis  was 

carried  out.  By  using  equation  (5)  and  (6),  both  the  real  and  imaginary  parts  of  the  refractive 

index for the two modes with the smallest decay are obtained, as shown in Fig. 5 (a). The reason 

for  the  discontinuity  is  clear:  the  imaginary  part  of  the  first  mode  exceeds  that  of  the  second 

mode  above  2  m,  for  a  thick  slab,  the  second  mode  become  the  dominant  mode.  The  results 

obtained  from  modal  analysis  are  consistent  with  that  from  inverse  method  very  well.  In 

addition, the coupling efficiency of an incident beam into each mode is also important. As shown 

in  Fig.  4,  the  effective  index  calculated  for  five  to  ten  layers  converge  very  well  except  for  a 

narrow wavelength range around 2 m where the two modes are comparable, indicating that the 

fundamental mode is absolutely dominant over other modes in most of the frequency range for 

6

such a thick slab. Furthermore, in Fig. 3, over the negative index region, the transmission is very 

large even for ten unit cells, indicating good coupling between a normally incident beam with the 

negative index fundamental mode. Next, we plot the figure of merit defined in Ref. [14], the ratio

of real part to the imaginary part of the effective index, which is shown in Fig. 5 (b). The highest 

value of 25 is achieved  around 1.7  m. Compared to that of a single unit  cell [14],  the optical 

properties of NIM slab consisting of multiple layer are much more improved. 

It  is  of  great  interest  to  study  how  light  propagates  inside  the  metamaterials.  We 

simulated a structure consisting of three unit cells along the propagating direction and calculated 

the distribution  of electric and magnetic fields at  several positions  from  z=0 to  z=130 nm  (the 

thickness of one unit cell) indicated by Fig. 6 (a). The phase of electric field averaged over one 

transverse unit cell versus propagating distance for three different wavelengths are shown in Fig. 

6  (b).  For  all  the  three  wavelengths,  the  phase  decreases  along  the  propagation,  directly 

demonstrating  the  property  of  back  phase  propagation.  Furthermore,  the  absolute  amount  of 

phase  change  from  z=0  to  z=130  nm  increases  with  increase  wavelength,  which  is  consistent 

with the effective index shown in Fig. 5.  The magnitude and phase of electric field at z=30 nm 

were plotted in Fig. 6 (c) and 6 (d). The electric field is mainly confined inside the rectangular 

aperture; the phase  of electric field  inside  the aperture is  more  uniform than  the magnitude.  In 

both plots, the modulation at high spatial frequency is due to the finite diffraction orders that are 

kept in the RCWA simulation. 

Finally, we plot the distribution of magnetic field, both magnitude and phase, across one 

transverse  unit  cell  at  z=30  nm  for  three  wavelengths  at  1.5,  1.7  and  2.1  m.  For  the  shortest 

wavelength  = 1.5 m, which is far away from the metamaterial resonance around 1.9-2.0 m, 

the magnitude of magnetic field is slightly higher in the area beneath the metal pattern than that 

7

in  the  air  aperture,  while  the  phase  of  the  magnetic  field  beneath  the  metal  lines  along  the 

magnetic field Hy (defined as region II) is exactly  shifted from that in the air aperture (defined 

as region I) and in the area beneath the thin metal wires along the electrical field Ex (defined as 

region III), as shown in Fig. 7 (a) and (b). Although the magnetic field in region III is as strong 

as that in region II, however, the area is much smaller, leading to an overall opposing magnetic 

field  to  that  in  region  I.  This  directly  verifies  the  existence  of  magnetic  activity  at  this 

wavelength, although not very strong. Furthermore, this result confirms one point made in Ref. 

[14],  e.g.  the  increase  of  metal  line  width  along  the  electric  field  would  weaken  the  magnetic 

resonant strength. At longer wavelength of 1.7 m that is closer to the resonance frequency, the 

magnetic field in  region  II and  III gets much larger than that in  region  I, leading to  a stronger 

magnetic activity and more negative index than that at 1.5 m, as shown in Fig. 7 (c) and (d). 

At  a  longer  wavelength  of  2.1  m,  the  fundamental  mode  switches  to  mode  2.  The 

corresponding magnetic field distribution also shows very different features from that of 1.5 and 

1.7 m. The magnetic field in region II has the same phase as that in region I, while the magnetic 

field in region III opposes to that in region I, but much weaker. So the overall magnetic field in II 

and  III is  positive  with  respect  to  that  in  region  I.  In addition,  the  magnetic  field  at  2.1  m  is 

much  smaller  than  that  at  1.5  and  1.7  m,  mainly  because  of  the  large  imaginary  part  of 

refractive index at 2.1 m.

In conclusion, we have numerically demonstrated a low loss negative-index metamaterial 

with  a  thickness  of  the  same  order  as  the  free  space  wavelength  (for  ten  layers)  in  the  near-

infrared  region.  Numerical  study  on  the  electromagnetic  fields  inside  the  metamaterial  slab 

verifies  backward  phase  propagation  and  strong  magnetic  activity  at  negative  index  region. 

Further studies (not shown here) show that if the thin air gaps are eliminated, the results would 

8

not  be  affected  much.  This  structure  can  be  fabricated  with  current  lithography  and  process 

techniques.

In the above  paper by Bechtel, Cai, Rooney and Wang, Physics of Fluids, 
2004,  16,  3955-3974  six  different  theories  of  a  Newtonian  viscous  fluid 
are  investigated  and  compared,  namely,  the  theory  of  a  compressible 
Newtonian  fluid,  and  five  constitutive  limits  of  this  theory:  the 
incompressible  theory,  the  limit  where  density  changes  only  due  to 
changes  in  temperature,  the  limit  where  density  changes  only  with 
changes  in  entropy,  the  limit  where  pressure  is  a  function  only  of 
temperature, and the limit of pressure a function only of entropy.  The six 
theories are compared through their ability to model two test problems: (i) 
steady  flow  between  moving  parallel  isothermal  planes  separated  by  a 
fixed  distance  with  no  pressure  gradient  in  the  flow  direction  (Couette 
flow),  and  (ii)  steady  flow  between  stationary  isothermal  parallel  planes 
with  a  pressure  gradient  (Poiseuille  flow).  The  authors  found,  among 
other,  that the incompressible theory admits solutions to these problems 
of  the  plane  Couette/Poiseuille  flow  form:  a  single  nonzero  velocity 
component in a direction parallel to the bounding planes, and velocity and 
temperature varying only in the direction perpendicular to the planes. 
   For  the  combination  of  incompressible  theory  and  Poiseuille  flow  the 
authors  presented  dimensionless  temperature  and  dimensionless  velocity 
profiles for Brinkman  number 2 (Br=2) and E=0, 3, 10 and 37 (page 3967 
in  their  work).  The  Brinkman  number  and  the  viscosity  parameter  E  are 
defined as (table II in their work)

planes, μw is the fluid dynamic viscosity at the planes and ε  is a constant 
included  in  the  following  equation  which  gives  the  fluid  viscosity  as    a 
function of temperature (equation 49 in their work)

However, the temperature and velocity profile for E=37 included in their 
figure  12  does  not  exist  in  reality.  Our    argument  is  based  on  the 
following facts. In two recent papers Costa and Mecedonio (2003, 2005) 
mention  that  in  a  steady–state  fully  developed  Poiseuille  flow  of  an 
incompressible  fluid  with  temperature-dependent  viscosity    there  is    a 
dimensionless  parameter G which is an important  criterion for this flow. 
If  G>Gcrit
the  system  does  not  admit  a  solution,  whereas  when  G<Gcrit
the  system  has  two  solutions,  one  of  which  (the  solution  with  greater 
temperature)  may be unstable. The existence  of a critical quantity which 
characterizes  the  flow  in  ducts 
for  fluids  with  temperature-dependent 
viscosity including viscous heating was suggested by Grundfest (1963). A 
very  good  review  on  this  matter  is  given  by  Sukanek  and  Laurence 
(1974). The parameter G is defined as

where  h  is  the  half  distance  between  the  planes  and  c  is  the  viscosity 
parameter  used  by  Costa  and  Macedonio  included  in    the  following 
equation which gives the fluid viscosity as  a function of temperature

                                                                                (5)

The  critical  value  of  G  is  5.64  (Gcrit=5.64,  Costa  and  Macedonio,  2003, 
page 550).   In equations (4) and (5), which concern the work of Costa and 
Macedonio,   we used the symbols used  by Bechtel et al. (2004)  to avoid 
confusion and to make some comparisons easier. The viscosity parameter 
E  and  the  Brinkman  number  Br  of    Bechtel  et  al.  (2004)  are  equivalent 
(not  exactly  the  same)    to  quantities  c  and  G  used  by  Costa  and 
Macedonio. The only difference between the Poiseuille problem treated by 
Bechtel  et  al.  (2004)  and  that  treated  by  Costa  and  Macedonio  (2003)  is 
the different function for fluid viscosity. Taking into account this fact it is 
natural  to assume that a similar criterion exists for the problem treated by 
Bechtel et. al.  In order to find this criterion  we solved the equations (73a) 
and (73b) given by Bechtel et al. with a finite difference method. 
    The  equations  (73a)  and  (73b)  represent  a  two-dimensional  parabolic 
flow. Such a flow has a predominant velocity in the streamwise coordinate 
(unidirectional  flow)  which  in  our  case  is  the  direction  along  the  planes. 
The equations were solved using the finite difference  method of Patankar 
(1980).      The  solution  procedure  starts  with  a  known  distribution  of 
velocity and temperature at the channel entrance (x=0) and marches along 
the  plates.    These  profiles  were  used  only  to  start  the  computations  and 
their  shape  had  no  influence  on  the  results  which  were  taken  far 
downstream.  At  the  channel  entrance    the  temperature  and  velocity  were 
taken  uniform  with  a  very small  value.  At  each  downstream  position  the 
discretized  equations    are  solved  using  the  tridiagonal  matrix  algorithm 
(TDMA). As x increases the successive velocity profiles become more and 
more similar and the same happens with temperature profiles. The solution 
procedure stops at the point where the successive velocity and successive 
temperature  profiles  become 
identical  (fully  developed  flow  both 
hydrodynamically and thermally). The forward step size Δx was 0.01 mm 
and  the    lateral  grid  cells    500.  The    results  are    grid  independent.  The 
parabolic  solution  procedure  is  a  well  known  solution  method  and    has 
been  used  extensively    in  the  literature.    It  appeared  for  the  first  time  in 
1970 (Patankar and Spalding, 1970)   and  has been included in classical 
fluid mechanics textbooks (see page 275 in  White 1991).  In the solution 
procedure  μ   has been considered as function of temperature (equation 3, 
present  work). The solution  procedure has  been  applied successfully  in a 

(Pantokratoras,  2006).  A  detailed  description  of  the 
similar  problem 
solution  procedure,  with  variable  thermophysical  properties,    may  be 
found in Pantokratoras (2002). 
    Before applying our solution procedure to the problem of Bechtel at al. 
(2004)  we applied  it to the  problem  of  Costa  and  Macedonio  (2003) and 
we found that the critical value of G is 5.64. For values of G greater than 
5.64 velocity and temperature increases without limit as Grundfest (1963) 
mentioned  in  his  work.  Our  velocity  and  temperature  profiles  agree  very 
well  with  those  included  in  figure  12  of  Bechtel  et  al.  for  E=0  (constant 
viscosity), 3 and 10. However for case E=37 we did not succeed to get a 
solution.    For  this  case  velocity  and  temperature  increases  without  limit. 
This  means  that  the  flow  with    Br=2  and  E=37,  given  by  Bechtel  et  al. 
(2004),    does  not  exist  because    the  characteristics  of  this  flow  exceed 
some criterion.  Using  a  trial  and  error procedure  we  found  that for  Br=2 
solutions exist only for E≤23.7.  In conclusion, this very interesting work 
by  Bechtel  et  al.  (2004),  should  be  modified  with  the  inclusion  of  the 
suitable criteria that are valid for each case treated in their work.

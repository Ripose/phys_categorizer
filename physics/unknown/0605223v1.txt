Chaos and Formation of Structures
in an Electron Flow with a Virtual Cathode
in the Bounded Drift Tube

Alexander Hramov

 

Abstract
—The electron ﬂow with a virtual cathode (VC) in the drift tube is investigated with the help of a
1.5-dimensional relativistic electromagnetic code. The existence of complex modes, including chaotic modes,
is demonstrated. The dynamic nature of chaos in the considered system is revealed. Physical processes in the
ﬂow are investigated, and it is found that the initiation of chaotic dynamics of the electron ﬂow with VC is
related to the nonlinear interaction of structures formed in the system.

INTRODUCTION

Oscillators  operating  on  supercritical  currents,  or
vircators  [1],  are  promising  sources  of  super-power
microwave radiation. The generation mechanism in the
vircator system is connected with formation in the elec-
tron  ﬂow  of  a  region  with  the  space-charge  potential
almost  equal  to  the  cathode  potential—the  so-called
virtual cathode (VC); as a result of reﬂection of a part
of  electrons  from  the  VC,  the  dual-ﬂow  state  in  the
cathode–VC space is formed. Experimental and numer-
ical  data  testify  that  the  electron  ﬂow  with  VC  has
complex  irregular  dynamics.  As  early  as  in  1985,
Brandt  [2],  considering  the  so-called  turbotron,  sug-
gested that the dynamics of a device with VC is nonlin-
ear. The studies of many groups of researchers revealed
various  manifestations  of  nonlinear  dynamics  of  the
electron ﬂow with VC, for example, locking of the VC
oscillations by external signals [3, 4] or chaotic behav-
ior of a ﬂow with VC [5]. In work [6], an assumption
concerning the deterministic nature of chaos in a device
with VC has been made.

At the same time, complex spatial–temporal dynam-
ics in distributed systems is related to the interaction of
emerging coherent spatial–temporal structures (see, for
example, [7–9]). The knowledge of internal dynamics
of the ﬂow allows one to perform an efﬁcient control of
the VC oscillations and increase the efﬁciency and gen-
erated power in devices with VC, which are sufﬁciently
important problems [6, 10].

In paper [11] devoted to investigation of a neutral-
ized electron ﬂow with VC in the Pierce diode, Anﬁno-
gentov has shown that the chaotic dynamics in this sys-
tem is determined by the formation and nonlinear inter-
action  of  two  electron  bunches  in  the  ﬂow  at  each
period of oscillations. These bunches are the VC itself

 

and bunches formed as a result of the VC disintegra-
tion. These objects are the autostructures that emerge as
a result of saturation of the Pierce and kinematic insta-
bilities.

However, standard vircators usually operate without
neutralization  of  the  electron  ﬂow. Therefore,  it  is  of
special interest to clear up processes that cause chaotic
dynamics in the electron ﬂow without neutralization by
the ion background with a supercritical current.

In this work, we present numerical results obtained
with the help of a mathematical model of the vacuum
microwave generator with VC, which is based on the
self-consistent  system  of  the  Vlasov–Maxwell  equa-
tions.  Using  the  methods  of  nonlinear  dynamics,  we
investigate  the  complex  behavior  of  an  electron  ﬂow
with VC  as  well  as  the  structure  formation  processes
and their relation to the chaotic dynamics in the consid-
ered system.

MATHEMATICAL  MODEL

R

We investigate a system that represents a short-cir-
cuit  section  of  a  circular  waveguide  of  length 
  and
 placed in a strong magnetic ﬁeld. The mono-
radius 
γ
speed electron ﬂow with the relativistic factor 
 = 2.3 is
injected  inside  the  system  through  the  cross  section
 = 0  (the  plane  of  injection).  We  consider  the  one-
z
 axis under
dimensional motion of the ﬂow along the 
the assumption that the beam is focused by a strong lon-
gitudinal magnetic ﬁeld.

together  with 

Numerical  simulation  has  shown  that,  for  α  >  1,
a VC, which reﬂects a part of electrons, is formed in the
ﬂow,  and  the  complexity  of  the  VC  oscillations
increases 
the  supercritical  factor.
Figure 1  presents  the  power  spectra,  projections  of
attractors of the time realizations of the beam current
from  the VC  region  restored  according  to  the Takens
method [16], and space–time diagrams of the electron
ﬂow in the drift space determined for different values of
supercritical factor α. Each line in the space–time dia-
grams is a trajectory of one charged particle.

0  ≈  2.6ω

p,  where  ω

For  small  α  (α  <  1.7),  regular  oscillations  of  the
relaxation type are established in the system (Fig. 1a).
The power spectrum contains narrow peaks represent-
ing multiple harmonics of the fundamental frequency
ω
p  is  the  plasma  frequency  of  the
electron ﬂow. The attractor projection corresponds to a
one-time  limiting  cycle.  When  α  increases,  periodic
oscillations  decay,  and  two  types  of  chaotic  behavior
arise sequentially as the supercritical factor increases.
In  the  ﬁrst  case  (1.7  <  α  <  3),  as  one  can  see  from
Fig. 1b, the chaotic attractor arises on the basis of one
unstable limiting cycle corresponding to the attracting
set  of  periodic  motions.  In  the  second  case  (α  >  3,
Fig. 1c), the phase portrait of oscillations is more uni-
form, and the attractor has a complex structure, which
consists  of  a  great  number  of  unstable  periodic
orbits [17]; the power spectrum contains a large portion
of noise and has no pronounced peaks. The form of the
spectrum  and  the  phase  portrait  indicates  that  an
increased  number  of  degrees  of  freedom  is  involved
into the oscillatory motion in the system.

In  order  to  analyze  the  attractor  dimensionality,  I
calculated  the  correlation  dimensionality  using  the
Grassberger–Procaccia algorithm [18, 19]. The results
conﬁrm  the  deterministic  nature  of  complex  oscilla-
tions of the VC, which is caused by saturation of the
attractor dimensionality that occurs when dimensional-
ity  m  of  the  space  of  imbedding  increases.  Such  a
behavior  of  the  dimensionality  indicates  that  chaotic
modes  are  deterministic,  because  the  correlation
dimensionality  of  noise  oscillations  does  not  become
saturated when m increases [20].

When  the  supercritical  factor  is  small,  the  dimen-
sionality  becomes  saturated  at  small  values  of  the
dimensionality  of  the  space  of  imbedding  (m  =  3–4).
For the second chaotic mode, the space of imbedding
has  a  substantially  larger  dimensionality,  m  =  7–9,
which  corresponds  to  the  initiation  of  more  complex
oscillations  of  the  VC.  The  number  n  of  the  excited
degrees of freedom in the system can be estimated by
the  upper  bound  of  dimensionality  ms  of  the  system
phase  space,  n  =  ms/2  [21],  where  ms  is  equal  to  the
dimensionality of the space of imbedding, at which the
attractor dimensionality becomes saturated.

The  analysis  of  the  results  presented  above  shows
that  only  a  small  number  of  degrees  of  freedom  is
excited in the system, although the electron ﬂow in the

drift space represents a system with an inﬁnite number
of degrees of freedom. When α increases, the number
of  degrees  of  freedom  involved  in  the  oscillatory
motion also increases. Nevertheless, this number is still
rather  small,  which  is  indirect  evidence  that  internal
motions in the ﬂow can be described with the help of a
limited number of structures in the system.

FORMATION  OF  STRUCTURES
IN  THE  FLOW

The existence of coherent structures (see, for exam-
ple,  [7–9,  22]  and  the  bibliographies  in  these  works)
indicates  the  presence  of  internal  spatial–temporal
dynamics in the distributed ﬂow system. We extracted
internal structures of the electron ﬂow using the method
of  orthogonal  decomposition  [the  Karhunen–Loéve
(KL) expansion] [23, 24].

The problem of extraction of KL-modes is reduced

to solving an integral equation

The kernel of the equation has the form

(10)

where 〈…〉
t denotes the time averaging. One can choose
a set of space–time distributions of any physical quan-
tity with zero mean value as functions ξ(z, t). For the
sake  of  convenience,  I  have  chosen  the  values  of  the
beam current jz(z, t) as functions ξ(z, t). Eigenvalue λ

corresponding to the nth mode Ψ
m is proportional to the
energy contained in this mode. The quantity

can be used as a measure of this energy.

Note  that  the  KL  expansion  is  optimal;  in  fact,
eigenfunctions  of  problem  (9)  and  (10)  form  a  basis
that ﬁts this problem, since the rms error (cid:2) is minimal:
(cid:2) = min〈||ξ – ξN|| 〉, where ξ is the exact solution, ξN is the
approximate  solution,  and  N  is  the  basis  dimensi-
onality.

The table presents energies Wn of the ﬁrst ten modes
for  different  values  of  the  supercritical  factor.  In  the
regular  mode  (α  =  1.4),  the  ﬁrst  two  modes  contain
about 90% of the ﬂow energy (W1 + W2 ~ 90%). When
α increases, the spectrum of the mode energies broad-
ens; the energy of the ﬁrst mode is pumped over gradu-
ally to higher-order modes; and, for α ~ 4, the main part
of  the  energy  is  contained  already  in  the  ﬁrst  four
modes (W1 + W2 + W3 + W4 ~ 90%). The energies of the

Spatial patterns of modes have complex multihump

more complicated and lose the symmetry that is char-

When  the  supercritical  factor  is  small  (Fig.  2a),  the
modes behave rather regularly. One can select the time
intervals,  when  a  burst  of  amplitude  A  is  observed,
which is coupled with formation and dynamics of VC
in the ﬂow, or when the mode amplitudes A1 ≈ A2 ≈ 0
(there are no structures in the ﬂow; VC is open). Taking
into  account  that  oscillations  of  the  ﬁrst  and  second
mode occur with a phase shift of π/2, we may assume
that  they  describe  the  dynamics  of  the  same  spatial–
temporal structure [25].

The developed chaos (Fig. 2b) is characterized by a
complicated  irregular  mode  dynamics;  the  structures
permanently exist in the ﬂow. It should be noted that,
here, the mode amplitudes are lower than in the case of
the regular operation mode. The cross-correlation func-
tion  of  processes  A1  and  A2  is  strongly  irregular  with
chaotic bursts, which allows us to relate each mode to
its own structure in the ﬂow.

Thus,  a  transition  from  regular  to  chaotic  motions
and  sequential  complication  of  chaotic  operation
modes is accompanied by an increase in the number of
the  ﬂow  structures,  and  the  mode  energies  draw
together.

Analysis of space–time diagrams (see Fig. 1) allows
one to establish a relationship between the KL-modes
obtained using orthogonal decomposition and physical
processes that accompany the complication of the VC
dynamics.  As  one  can  see  from  Fig.  1a,  there  exists
only one structure (VC) in the regular operation mode
(the time interval of its existence within each oscilla-
tion  period—from  the  formation  to  disintegration—
coincides  with  the  burst  of  the  mode  amplitudes  in

Fig. 2a). The main portion of the energy of oscillatory
motion  in  the  system  falls  on  higher-order  modes  Ψ
1
and Ψ
2; their behavior describes the dynamics of this
structure.

As α increases (due to kinematic instability of the
electron ﬂow in the varying ﬁeld of the opening VC),
the  secondary  structures  are  formed  in  the  ﬂow;  the
energy increases gradually together with α due to the
energy transfer from the higher-order mode. As can be
seen from Fig. 1c, a well-developed VC is absent in the
ﬂow in the case of developed chaos. This situation may
be  interpreted  as  the  existence  in  the  ﬂow  of  several
typical  structures  described  by  KL-modes.  Each  of
these structures is considered as a proper VC; i.e., as the
plane reﬂecting charged particles, which is located at a
certain  distance  from  the  injection  plane  and  corre-
sponding  to  the  charge  density  maximum  in  the  drift
space. Interaction of these structures (VC) through the
reﬂection  of  a  part  of  the  ﬂow  from  each  of  them
strongly  affects  the  formation  of  other  structures  and
ensures, due to this fact, a distributed internal feedback
in the ﬂow. This process is equivalent to the formation
of  several  feedback  loops  with  different  time  delays,
which may explain strongly irregular dynamics of the
system in the case of large supercritical factor α.

CONCLUSION

The electron ﬂow with VC and without neutraliza-
tion  by  the  ion  background  in  the  bounded  drift  tube
demonstrates different types of nonlinear oscillations.
For a small supercritical factor (α < 3), a low-dimen-
sional  chaos  is  established  in  the  system.  When  α
increases,  the  system  demonstrates  the  developed
chaos. In the regular operation mode, there is only one
structure (VC) in the ﬂow; the VC can be described by
the dynamics of the ﬁrst two KL modes; more than 85%
of  the  energy  of  oscillatory  motion  falls  on  these
modes. The chaotic dynamics can be explained by the
formation and interaction of several coherent structures
in the electron ﬂow with a smoother distribution of the
energy over modes.

The understanding of physical processes in the con-
sidered system with VC allows one to develop efﬁcient
methods to control the system by affecting the structure
formation  in  the  electron  ﬂow  with  VC.  Apparently,
among these mechanisms that affect the formation of
structures in the ﬂow is the introduction into the system
with VC  of  an  external  or  internal  feedback  [26–28],
which enables one to suppress the formation of second-
ary structures by means of a preliminary modulation of
the electron ﬂow.

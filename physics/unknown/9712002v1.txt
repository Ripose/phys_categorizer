Abstract

A generalization of the notion of a (pseudo-) Riemannian space is proposed in
a framework of noncommutative geometry.
In particular, there are parametrized
families of generalized Riemannian spaces which are deformations of classical ge-
ometries. We also introduce harmonic maps on generalized Riemannian spaces into
Hopf algebras and make contact with integrable models in two dimensions.

1 Introduction

As a classical geometry we understand an n-dimensional Riemannian3 space M which
consists of a smooth orientable manifold M and a metric tensor ﬁeld

where A is the algebra of smooth function on M. The metric induces a Hodge operator

g = gµν dxµ ⊗A dxν

⋆ : Λr(M) → Λn−r(M)

where Λr(M) is the space of diﬀerential r-forms on M. From the action of the Hodge
operator we recover the (inverse) metric components with respect to the coordinates xµ
as follows,

gµν = ⋆−1(dxµ ∧ ⋆ dxν) .

A generalization of classical geometries is obtained by generalizing the concept of dif-
ferential forms, accompanied with a suitable generalization of the Hodge operator. The
3Here and in the following ‘Riemannian’ includes pseudo-Riemannian, i.e., the case of an indeﬁnite

metric.

algebra of (ordinary) diﬀerential forms is then replaced by some ‘noncommutative’ diﬀer-
ential algebra on M. Essentially, this means that we keep all the basic formulas of the
classical diﬀerential calculus but dispense with commutativity of functions and diﬀeren-
tials. A further generalization of geometries consists in replacing the underlying space M,
or rather the (suitably restricted) algebra of functions on it, by some noncommutative
associative algebra A. All this will be made more precise in section 2.

Given a generalized Riemannian space, one can consider analogues of physical models
and dynamical systems on it. Of particular interest are generalized geometries and models
which are deformations of classical geometries and models in the sense that they depend
on some parameter in such a way that the basic algebraic relations become the classical
ones when the parameter tends to a certain value. We then have the chance to study
models which are ‘close’ to known models of physical relevance. Section 3 is devoted to
corresponding generalizations of harmonic maps into groups (or Hopf algebras), which
are also known as (a class of) σ-models or principal chiral models. This is based on our
previous work [1-5].
In subsection 3.3 we make an attempt to generalize the latter to
noncommutative algebras. We have to stress, however, that this is more a report on work
in progress than something which has reached a satisfactory status. Section 4 contains
some conclusions.

2 Generalizations of classical geometries

Let A be an associative algebra with unit element 1I. A diﬀerential calculus on A consists
of a diﬀerential algebra Ω(A) and an operator d which shares some basic properties with
the exterior derivative of the ordinary diﬀerential calculus on manifolds. A diﬀerential
algebra is a ZZ-graded associative algebra (over IR, respectively C)

Ω(A) = M

r≥0

Ωr(A)

(4)

(5)

(6)
(7)

where the spaces Ωr(A) are A-bimodules and Ω0(A) = A. The operator d is a linear4
map

d : Ωr(A) → Ωr+1(A)

with the properties

d2 = 0

d(w w′) = (dw) w′ + (−1)r w dw′

where w ∈ Ωr(A) and w′ ∈ Ω(A). The last relation is known as the (generalized) Leibniz
rule. We also require 1I w = w 1I = w for all elements w ∈ Ω(A). The identity 1I1I = 1I
then implies d1I = 0. Furthermore, it is assumed that d generates the spaces Ωr(A) for
r > 0 in the sense that Ωr(A) = A dΩr−1(A) A.

4Here and in the following linear means linear over the respective ﬁeld which is IR or C in the cases

under consideration.

2.1 Commutative algebras with noncommutative diﬀerential cal-

culi and the Hodge operator

Let A be a commutative algebra, freely generated by elements xµ, µ = 1, . . . , n. A
diﬀerential calculus (Ω(A), d) is called n-dimensional if
(1) dxµ is a left and also a right A-module basis of Ω1(A),
(2) Ωr(A) = {0} for r > n, but Ωn(A) 6= {0},
(3) dim Ωr(A) = dim Ωn−r(A) as left as well as right A-modules (r = 0, . . . , n).

In the following we consider a (freely generated) commutative algebra A with an
n-dimensional diﬀerential calculus (Ω(A), d). A generalized Hodge operator is a linear
invertible map

⋆ : Ωr → Ωn−r

r = 0, . . . , n

such that5

⋆ (w f ) = f ⋆ w

∀f ∈ A, w ∈ Ωr(A) .

Deﬁning ⋆ on a basis of r-forms, this covariance property allows us to calculate its action
on any r-form. According to (3) we should be most interested in the action of ⋆ on 1-forms
and n-forms. We call (A, Ω(A), d, ⋆) an n-dimensional generalized Riemannian space.

Example. Let A be the algebra of functions on the lattice ZZ n with the n-dimensional
diﬀerential calculus determined by

[dxµ, xν] = δµν dxν

in terms of the canonical coordinates xµ on ZZ n (cf [6]). As a consequence, we have

df =

[f (x1, . . . , xµ−1, xµ + 1, xµ+1, . . . , xn) − f (x1, . . . , xn)] dxµ

(11)

n

X
µ=1

and

dxµ dxν = −dxν dxµ .

This familiar anticommutativity of diﬀerentials does not extend to general 1-forms, how-
ever, as in the ordinary calculus of diﬀerential forms. Let ǫµ1...µn be totally antisymmetric
with ǫ1...n = 1 and (ηµν) = diag(1, −1, . . . , −1). We deﬁne

⋆ (dxµ1 · · · dxµr ) :=

ηµ1ν1 · · · ηµrνr ǫν1...νrκ1...κn−r dxκ1 · · · dxκn−r .

(13)

(n − r)!

What we have here is a discrete version of the n-dimensional Minkowski space. Note that

dxµ ⋆ dxν = ⋆ ηµν .

In terms of the rescaled coordinates xµ′

Ignoring the origin of the primed coordinates, this is a deformation of the algebraic rela-
tions of the ordinary diﬀerential calculus on IRn (where diﬀerentials and functions com-
mute). For each coordinate a contraction ℓµ → 0 can then be performed. In the new
coordinates, the metric components are

and are thus witness to the rescaling. A less trivial coordinate transformation is given by

gµ′ν′

:= ⋆−1(dxµ′

⋆ dxν′

) = ℓµ ℓν ηµν

yµ := (qµ)xµ

′

/ℓµ

with qµ ∈ C \ {0, 1} and not a root of unity. This implies

dyµ =

qµ − 1
ℓµ

yµ dxµ′

,

dxµ′

yµ = qµ yµ dxµ′

and turns (15) into the ‘quantum plane’ relations

dyµ yµ = qµ yµ dyµ

(see also [7]). For diﬀerent indices µ 6= ν, dyµ and yν simply commute. The components
of the metric in the new coordinates yµ are

gµν := ⋆−1(dyµ ⋆ dyν) = (qµ − 1) (qν − 1) yµ yν ηµν .

(20)

One might expect that the inverse gµν deﬁnes an invariant object via gµν dyµ ⊗A dyν,
dyµ⊗Agµν dyν or dyµ⊗Adyν gµν. However, none of these expressions is equal to ηµν dxµ⊗A
♦
dxν, but diﬀers by a factor which is a power of q.

Using the Hodge operator, we deﬁne a scalar product on Ω1 by setting

From (9) and the corresponding formula for the inverse of ⋆ we obtain

(α, β f ) = (α f, β) ,

(f α, β) = (α, β) f = f (α, β)

(since A is assumed to be commutative). The components of the scalar product are

(α, β) := ⋆−1(α ⋆ β) .

gµν := (dxµ, dxν) .

Let yµ ∈ A. Then

dyµ = ( ˆ∂νyµ) dxν
(24)
with generalized partial derivatives ˆ∂ν. We call yµ ‘coordinates’ if ˆ∂νyµ is invertible. From
the above properties of the scalar product we get

gµ′ν′

= (dyµ, dyν) = ˆ∂κyµ (dxκ, ˆ∂λyν dxλ) .

(25)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(21)

(22)

(23)

Let us now assume that the scalar product is symmetric, i.e., (α, β) = (β, α) for all 1-forms
α, β, which means

In this case we have also

and thus

α ⋆ β = β ⋆ α .

(α, f β) = f (α, β) .

gµ′ν′

= ˆ∂κyµ ˆ∂λyν (dxκ, dxλ) = ˆ∂κyµ ˆ∂λyν gκλ .

To construct a tensor ﬁeld from these components, the usual tensor product ⊗A is not the
right one as long as functions do not commute with diﬀerentials (see the example above).
In the case of a commutative algebra there is also a tensor product, denoted as ⊗L, which
(besides bilinearity over IR, respectively C) satisﬁes

Then

is a tensorial object.

(f α) ⊗L (h β) = f h (α ⊗L β) .

g := gµν dxµ ⊗L dxν

2.2 Noncommutative algebras and the Hodge operator

The covariance property for the Hodge operator, as formulated in (9), is not compatible
with a noncommutative algebra A. A modiﬁcation is needed. Let † be an involution of
A. We generalize the covariance rule as follows,6

so that

⋆ (w f ) = f † ⋆ w

⋆ (w (f h)) = (f h)† ⋆ w = h† f † ⋆ w = h† ⋆ (wf ) = ⋆ ((wf ) h) .

Again, we assume that the Hodge operator is an invertible map Ωr(A) → Ωn−r(A) for
some n ∈ IN. For its inverse (31) implies

⋆−1 (f w) = (⋆−1w) f † .

As a consequence, the scalar product on Ω1(A), deﬁned again by (21), satisﬁes

(α, β f ) = (α f †, β) ,

(f α, β) = (α, β) f † .

Let us now assume that † extends to an involution of Ω(A) so that

(w w′)† = w′† w† .
6Note that this rule does not reduce to our previous rule in the case of a commutative algebra A when

(35)

the involution acts nontrivially on A.

(26)

(27)

(28)

(29)

(30)

(31)

(32)

(33)

(34)

We still have to deﬁne how the exterior derivative d interacts with the involution. Here
we adopt the following rule

(dw)† = (−1)r+1 d(w†)

for w ∈ Ωr(A) (cf [8], for example).

We can now consistently impose the condition

(⋆w)† = ⋆−1(w†)

since

(⋆ (w f ))† = (f † ⋆ w)† = (⋆ w)† f = [⋆−1(w†)] f = ⋆−1(f †w†) = ⋆−1[(wf )†] .

3 Generalized harmonic maps into matrix Hopf al-

gebras

Let H be a matrix Hopf algebra (cf [9], in particular). This is a Hopf algebra generated
by elements ai
j, i, j = 1, . . . , N. The coproduct Φ : A → A ⊗ A is given by

Φ(ai

j) = ai

k ⊗ ak

j

using the summation convention. The antipode S satisﬁes

S(ai

k) ak

j = δi

j 1I = ai

k S(ak

j) .

In terms of the N × N matrix a = (ai

j) we have Φ(a) = a ⊗ a and

S(a) a =

in matrix notation. Let (A, Ω(A), d, ⋆) be a generalized geometry in the sense of the
preceeding section and let us assume that the entries of a are constructed from elements
of A. The matrix of 1-forms

then satisﬁes the identity

The ﬁeld equation

A := S(a) da

F := dA + AA = 0 .

d ⋆ A = 0

now deﬁnes a generalized harmonic map into a matrix Hopf algebra.7 Note that we do not
need the full Hodge operator here, but only its restriction to 1-forms, i.e., ⋆ : Ω1(A) →
Ωn−1(A).

7We may also call this a generalized principal chiral model or a generalized σ-model (see [10], for

example). Some related ‘noncommutative examples’ can be found in [11].

A generalized conserved current of a generalized harmonic map is a 1-form J which

satisﬁes

pletely) integrable if there is an inﬁnite set of independent8 conserved currents.

3.1

Integrable 2-dimensional generalized harmonic maps on com-
mutative algebras

For 2-dimensional classical σ-models there is a construction of an inﬁnite tower of con-
served currents [12]. This has been generalized in [1-4] to harmonic maps on ordinary
(topological) spaces, but with noncommutative diﬀerential calculi, and values in a matrix
group. In the following, we brieﬂy recall the essential steps of our construction.

Let us consider a generalized harmonic map on a 2-dimensional generalized Rieman-
nian space (in the sense of subsection 2.1) which satisﬁes the symmetry condition (26)
and furthermore, for α ∈ Ω1(A),

dα = 0 ⇒ α = ⋆ ⋆ dχ

(46)

with a function χ.

Let us start with the N × N matrix

Then

J (1) = ⋆ dχ(1)

J (2) := Dχ(1)

(49)

(50)

d ⋆ J (2) = d ⋆ Dχ(1) = D ⋆ dχ(1) = DJ (1) = D2χ(0) = F = 0 ,
(51)
8A convenient notion of independence in this context still has to be found. For example, in the case
of classical models where integration is deﬁned and the conserved currents lead to conserved charges, it
may happen that a charge is a polynomial in some other charges. In an extreme case, we could get an
inﬁnite tower of conserved charges as the set of polynomials in a single charge. We would not like to talk
about complete integrability in such a case.

since d ⋆ D = D ⋆ d on N × N matrices with entries in A. The latter follows from (9),
(44) and (26) (cf [1,2]). Again, (46) implies

with an N × N matrix χ(2) of elements of A. Now

J (2) := ⋆ dχ(2)

J (3) := Dχ(2)

is another N × N matrix of conserved currents, and so forth. In this way we obtain an
inﬁnite set of (matrices of) conserved currents. There is no guarantee, however, that all
these currents are really independent. It can happen, as in the case of the free linear wave
equation on two-dimensional Minkowski space, that the higher conserved charges are just
polynomials in a ﬁnite number of independent ones.

In this subsection we have considered a commutative algebra A, but with a noncommu-
tative diﬀerential calculus. Even in this case a huge set of possibilities for integrable models
arises and several examples have already been elaborated [1-4].

Example. We recall the following example from [1] (see also [2-5]). Let A be the algebra
of functions f (t, x) on IR × ZZ which are smooth in the ﬁrst argument. A diﬀerential
calculus on A is then determined by the relations

[dt, t] = 0 ,

[dx, x] = ℓ dx ,

[dt, x] = [dx, t] = 0 .

A Hodge operator, restricted to 1-forms, is given by9

⋆ dt = −dx ,

⋆ dx = −dt .

The diﬀerential calculus and the Hodge operator satisfy the conditions (26) and (46). Let
a = e−u with a function u(t, x), so we consider only the case where N = 1. Then, using
(9) and (11), the ﬁeld equation d ⋆ A = 0 turns out to be the equation of the nonlinear
Toda lattice,

¨uk +

1
ℓ2 (euk−uk+1 − euk−1−uk) = 0

where uk(t) := u(t, k ℓ). In the limit as ℓ → 0 the generalized geometry tends to that
of the 2-dimensional Minkowski space and the above ﬁeld equation becomes the linear
wave equation. We refer to the references mentioned above for details and also for matrix
♦
generalizations of the Toda lattice (i.e., N > 1).

A new example is presented in the following subsection.

9Note that the parameter ℓ does not appear in these relations. Hence they are not obtained by a
simple coordinate rescaling x 7→ x/ℓ from the ℓ = 1 formulas. This has to be distinguished from what we
did in the example in subsection 2.1.

[dx, t] = b dx ,

[dx, x] = −

with real constants a, b 6= 0. In terms of the complex variable z = t/b + i x/a, the above

[dz, ¯z] = 0 ,

[d¯z, z] = 0 ,

[d¯z, ¯z] = 2 d¯z

In the complex coordinates z, ¯z we thus have

Together with the property of the diﬀerential calculus that every closed 1-form is exact10,
this implies that (46) holds. Furthermore, a direct calculation shows that also (26) is
satisﬁed. The above constraint for the constants κ, σ is solved by writing σ = sin θ and
κ = cos θ with a parameter θ.

which, admittedly, is a rather unfamiliar equation.

3.3 Generalization to noncommutative algebras

In order to generalize the construction of conservation laws to noncommutative algebras
A, we impose some conditions in addition to those already introduced in subsection 2.2.
In particular, we make the assumption that for each r = 0, . . . , n there is a constant ǫr 6= 0
such that11

respectively,

⋆ ⋆w = ǫr w

∀w ∈ Ωr

⋆ w = ǫ†

r ⋆−1 w .

Applying the involution and using (37) we ﬁnd

1
ǫ†
r

⋆ (w†) = ⋆−1(w†) = (⋆w)† = ǫr (⋆−1w)† = ǫr ⋆ (w†)

10The proof is simple. It is a slight variation of the proof of a Lemma in [4].
11An apparently weaker assumption would be:

for each w ∈ Ωr(A) exists a constant ǫw such that
⋆ ⋆ w = ǫw w. However, this reduces to our previous assumption as follows. Since ⋆⋆ is linear, we have
ǫw+w′ (w + w′) = ⋆ ⋆ (w + w′) = ⋆ ⋆ w + ⋆ ⋆ w′ = ǫww + ǫw′w′ and thus (ǫw+w′ − ǫw)w = (ǫw+w′ − ǫw′)w′
for arbitrary w, w′ ∈ Ω(A).
If w, w′ are linearly independent, then ǫw = ǫw′ = ǫw+w′. Furthermore,
c ǫww = c ⋆ ⋆w = ⋆ ⋆ (c w) = ǫcw c w implies ǫcw = ǫw where c ∈ C. It follows that ǫ is constant on Ωr(A),
i.e., ǫw = ǫr ∀ w ∈ Ωr(A).

(67)

(68)

(69)

(70)

(71)

(72)

and thus

Instead of the symmetry condition (26) we impose the condition

ǫ†
r =

1
ǫr

.

(α ⋆ β)† = ǫ†

n β ⋆ α

where α, β ∈ Ω1(A). This is consistent with (31) since

[α ⋆ (β f )]† = [α f † ⋆ β]† = ǫ†

n β ⋆ (α f †) = ǫ†

n (β f ) ⋆ α .

As a consequence, we ﬁnd

(α, β)† = [⋆−1(α ⋆ β)]† = [⋆−1 ǫn (β ⋆ α)†]† = ǫn ⋆ (β ⋆ α) = ǫn ǫ†

n (β, α)

= (β, α) .

A crucial step in the construction of conserved currents for harmonic maps on com-
mutative algebras in subsection 3.1 is the identity d ⋆ D = D ⋆ d. A suitable generalization
is now obtained as follows. First, we have

(d ⋆ dχi

j)† = d(⋆ dχi

j)† = d ⋆−1 (dχi

j)† = −d ⋆−1 d(χi

j)† = −ǫ1 d ⋆ d(χi

j)†

(77)

using (36), (37), again (36) and then (71). Furthermore,

[d(χk

j)† ⋆ Ai

k]† = ǫ†

n Ai

k ⋆ d(χk

j)†

using (74). Hence

d ⋆ Dχi

j + Ai
j + d(χk

j = d ⋆ (dχi

using d ⋆ A = 0. Consequently, if ǫ1 = −ǫ†

n we have

d ⋆ D(χ†) = −(ǫ†

1 D ⋆ dχ)† .

For n = 2 and assuming (46), the construction of conservation laws now generalizes to
the case of a noncommutative algebra A.

Example. Let A be the Heisenberg algebra with the two generators q and p satisfying

In the simplest diﬀerential calculus on A we have

Moreover, the relations (82) imply

dq dq = 0 ,

dq dp + dp dq = 0 ,

dp dp = 0 .

As an involution we choose hermitean conjugation with q† = q, p† = p. A ⋆-operator
satisfying the conditions (71) and (74) is determined by

⋆ 1 = dq dp ,

⋆ dq = dp ,

⋆ dp = −dq ,

⋆ (dq dp) = 1

(so that ǫ0 = ǫ2 = 1, ǫ1 = −1). Now we consider a generalized harmonic map with values
in the group of unitary elements U of A which satisfy U †U = 1I = UU †. With

and thus

the ﬁeld equation d ⋆ A = 0 becomes

In terms of P := U †p U, Q := U †q U this takes the form

[p, U †p U] + [q, U †q U] = 0 .

[p, P ] + [q, Q] = −i ¯h ( ˆ∂qP − ˆ∂pQ) = 0 .

If dα = 0 for a 1-form α implies α = dF with some F ∈ A, then also (46) holds and all
the required conditions are fulﬁlled. On the level of formal power series in q and p, every
closed 1-form is indeed exact. Of course, one would like to substantiate these results on
♦
the level of functional analysis which, however, is beyond the scope of this work.

4 Conclusions

We proposed a generalization of Riemannian geometry and harmonic maps within a wide
framework of noncommutative geometry. It centers around a generalization of the Hodge
operator to (noncommutative) diﬀerential calculi on associative algebras. The main mo-
tivation originated from previous work where we recovered lattice gauge theory from a

12

noncommutative geometry on IRn [6] and where we realized that, in particular, the non-
linear Toda lattice model can be expressed as an integrable harmonic map equation, but
with respect to a simple deformation of the ordinary diﬀerential calculus [1-4] (cf the
example in subsection 3.1).

In the present work we also addressed the case of ‘noncommutative spaces’. Further
work is certainly needed to understand the signiﬁcance of ‘noncommutative integrable
models’ and more examples have to be elaborated. It should also be possible to weaken
the restrictions some more which we imposed above in order to generalize the classical
construction of conservation laws for 2-dimensional σ-models to noncommutative spaces.
The new material which we presented in subsection 3.3 has a fair chance to guide us to a
class of interesting models in the same way as the intermediate step to noncommutative
diﬀerential calculi on ordinary spaces led us [1] to physical models like the nonlinear Toda
chain.

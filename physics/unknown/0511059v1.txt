Abstract 

 

A  classic  problem  of  the  motion  of  a  point  mass 
(projectile)  thrown  at  an  angle  to  the  horizon  is 
reviewed.  The  air  drag  force  is  taken  into  account  with 
the  drag  factor  assumed  to  be  constant.  Analytic 
approach  is  used  for  investigation.  Simple  analytical 
formulas  are  used  for  the  constructing  the  envelope  of 
the family of the point mass trajectories. The equation of 
envelope is applied for determination of maximum range 
of  flight.  The  motion  of  a  baseball  is  presented  as  an 
example. 

 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
The problem of the motion of a point mass thrown at an angle to the horizon is a 
constituent of  many introductory  courses  on  physics.  With  zero  air  drag  force, 
the  analytic  solution  is  well  known.  The  trajectory  of  the  point  mass  is  a 
parabola.  With air drag taken into account, a finding the main variables of the 
problem is reduced to quadratures [1 – 4].  Appropriate integrals are not taken in 
finite  form.  The  problem,  to  all  appearance,  does  not  have  the  exact  analytic 
solution,  and  therefore  in  most  cases  is  solved  numerically  [5].  Analytic 
approaches  to  the  solution  of  the  problem  are  not  sufficiently  advanced. 
Meanwhile,  analytic  solutions  are  very  convenient  for  a  straightforward 
adaptation  to  applied  problems  and  especially  useful  for  a  qualitative  analysis. 
Comparatively  simple  approximate  analytical  formulas  to  study  the  motion  of 
the point mass in a medium with quadratic drag force have been obtained  using 
such  an  approach    [6  –  7]  .  These  formulas  make  it  possible  to  carry  out  a 
complete  qualitative  analysis  without  using  numeric  integration  of  point  mass 
motion differential equations. 

This paper considers application of formulas [6 – 7] for the constructing 
the envelope of the family of the point mass trajectories.  Family of trajectories 
is  formed  when  throwing  a  point  mass  with  one  and  same  initial  velocity,  but 
with  different  angles  of  throwing.  Problem  of  constructing  the  envelope  is 

solved by means of simple analytical formulas. Equation of the envelope is used 
for finding of maximum range of flight of point mass in the case when the spot 
of incidence is above or below than spot of throwing. In the examples cited is 
shown  that  obtained  formulas  ensure  high  accuracy  of  determination  of 
maximum range. Mistake of analytical calculation of range does not exceed 1%.

FORMULAS FOR BASIC  PARAMETERS  
 
The problem of the motion of a point mass in air, with a number of conventional 
assumptions, in case of the drag force proportional to the square of the velocity, 
R =

Here V is the velocity of the point mass,  θ is the angle between the tangent to 
the trajectory of the point mass and the horizontal,  g  is the acceleration due to 
gravity,  m  is the mass of the particle,  x, y are the Cartesian coordinates of the

Comparatively  simple  approximate  analytical  formulas  for  the  eight 
basic parameters of point mass motion are obtained in [6 – 7]. Let us set out the  
relationships  required  for  the  maximum  ascent  height    H,    velocity  at  the 
trajectory  apex  V ,  motion  time    T,    flight  range    L,    and  the  abscissa  of  the

With  zero  drag  (k  =  0),  formulas  (2)  go  over  into  respective  formulas  of  the

the points of incidence and throwing are on the same horizontal  is obtained in

3. THE EQUATION OF THE ENVELOPE IN MIDAIR 
 
In  the  case  of  no  drag  the  trajectory  of  a  point  mass  is  a  parabola.  For  the 
different  angles  of  throwing  under  one  and  same  initial  velocity    projectile 
trajectories  form  a  family  of  parabolas.  Maximum  range  and  maximum  height 
for limiting parabolas are given by formulas

We will set up an analytical formula similar to (6) for the envelope of the point 
mass trajectories taking into account the air drag force. 

Taking  into  account  the  formula  (6),  we  will  derive  an  equation  of  the

Such  structure  of  equation  takes  into  account  the  fact  that  the  envelope  has  a

The  equation  of  the  envelope  can  be  used  for  the  determination  of  maximum

4. THE RESULTS OF THE CALCULATIONS 
 
As   an   example  we  will  consider  the  moving  of  a  baseball  with  the  
resistance  factor  k = 0.000548 s2/m2 [5].  Other parameters of motion are given 
by values 

g =  9.81 м/c2,

 45 m/s ,   
  in  the  formula  (9),  we  get 

  ± 20 m,   ± 40 m.

69.4  m.  
Substituting    values    k   and   
Hereinafter we solve an equation (3) at the value of non-dimensional parameter 
1.11. The root of this equation gives the value of an optimum angle

family  of  trajectories  is  received  by  means  of  numerical  integrating  of  the 
equations  of  motion  of  a  point  mass  (1).  A  standard  fourth-order  Runge-Kutta

Numerical values of the range in the table 1 are also received by integrating a

(3), (7), (11) ensure sufficiently pinpoint accuracy of calculation of parameters 
of motion. 
  
5. CONCLUSION 
 
The proposed approach based on the use of analytic formulas makes it possible 
to significantly simplify a qualitative analysis of the motion of a point mass with 
the  air  drag  taken  into  account.  All  basic  parameters  of  motion,  functional 
relationships  and  various  problems  of  optimization  are  described  by  simple 
analytical  formulas.  Moreover,  numerical  values  of  the  sought  variables  are 
determined with an acceptable accuracy. Thus, many formulas [6] – [7] and (2) 
–  (11)  make  it  possible  to  carry  out  complete  analytical  investigation  of  the 
motion of a point mass in a media with drag same as it is done for the case of no 
drag.

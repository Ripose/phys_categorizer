Abstract. 
Doppler shift formulas are derived for two less studied scenarios: stationary receiver and 
source in harmonic oscillatory motion and stationary receiver and source in uniform 
circular motion. For each of the scenarios we derive a formula, one which works when 
the emission period is small enough that it can be considered that two successive signals 
are emitted from the same point in space (locality assumption) and another which takes 
into account that two successive signals are emitted from two different points in space 
(non-locality assumption). The results furnished by the two Doppler shift formulas are 
compared, showing that increasing the emission frequency decreases the difference 
between the results obtained with the two formulas. 
 

1.  Introduction 

 
Doppler shift experiments are performed in college laboratories. The experimental 
devices used and the results obtained are presented by many authors. Different scenarios 
are followed, from the simplest longitudinal Doppler effect (stationary observer and 
source moving with constant speed along the line which joins them) [1] to the more 
sophisticated ones, involving an accelerating source [2], or source in uniform motion but 
with an oblique angle of incidence to the received wave crests [3]. 
The experimental results are interpreted using a Doppler shift formula which holds only 
in the case of the plane wave approximation (very big distance between receiver and 
source) or in the case of the very small period approximation [3], even if it is obvious that 
the scenarios followed do not meet the imposed conditions. In the case of the very small 
period approximation, the periods are small enough that it can be considered that the 
moving source emits two successive wave-crests from the same point in space.  This 
idealized situation is called locality. The simple fact that the source moves is associated 
with the fact that it emits two successive wave-crests from two different points in space 
and we call this situation non-locality, [4]. 
We present first a derivation of the Doppler shift formula in the locality assumption. 
Receiver R is located at the origin O of its rest frame K(XOY). The position of the source 
S in K(XOY) is defined by its polar coordinates S(r,θS), (Figure 1). S emits an acoustic 
signal (wave-crest) at a time tS, which is received by R at a time tR. The two times are 
related by

It is obvious that Equation (4) holds only in the case of the very small period 
approximation, when we can consider that dtS and dtR represent the very small periods at 
which the wave-crests are emitted and received, respectively. Introducing the concept of 
“very high frequency,” Equation (4) is presented in many cases as

where D represents a Doppler factor and where fR=1/dtR and fS=1/dtS represent the 
frequencies at which the signals are emitted and received, respectively. 
In the non-locality approach, we consider that S emits two successive wave-crests 
(signals) at tS and tS+TS, where TS represents the constant period at which the signals are 
emitted. The emissions take place from the positions of the source S1(r1,θS,1) and 
S2(r2,θS,2). R(0,0) receives the two signals at the times

so the time interval between the reception of the two signals is given by 

the result depending on the law which defines the motion of the source relative to the 
receiver.  
The purpose of our paper is to follow scenarios which ensure that during the emission of 
two successive signals the velocity of the source and the direction along which the signals 
are emitted can change. In each case, locality and non-locality approaches are presented 
and the obtained results are compared. 
 
2.  Doppler shift formula for stationary observer and source in harmonic motion. 
 
Observer R is located at the origin O of the K(XOY) reference frame and the source 
performs an oscillatory harmonic motion along the OY axis (Figure 2). We have during a 
period of the oscillatory motion, longitudinal Doppler effects with outgoing source and 

increasing velocities, outgoing source with decreasing velocity, incoming source with 
increasing velocity and incoming source with decreasing velocity, if at t=0 the source S is 
located in front of the receiver, in a state of rest. All this peculiarities of the oscillatory 
motion influence the Doppler shift in a characteristic way, increasing or decreasing it. As 
we see from Figure 2, at a time t the source is at a distance 
y = A 1− cosωtS
 
 
from the source, ω representing the circular frequency and A the amplitude. If a signal is 
emitted at a time tS, it is received by R at a time tR given by 

(9) 

) 

(

 

 

 

 

Differentiating both sides of Equation (10), we obtain the following Doppler shift 
formula 

Expressed as a function of frequencies, Equation (11) becomes

where V=Aω  represents the amplitude of the velocity of the source and v=AωsinωtS 
represents its instantaneous velocity. 
In the non-locality approach, we consider that the successively emitted signals are labeled 
0,1,2…n…N, where N represents the total number of signals emitted during a period of 
oscillation T=2π/ω. If TS represents the constant period at which the signals are emitted, 
it is related to T by

allowing for a continuous variation of n. 
The experimental device allows changing N and V/U. Increasing N we reduce the time 
interval between the emission of two successive signals, a fact which favors the locality 
assumption. Therefore, the difference between the results furnished by Equations (17) 
and (18) decreases. This fact is illustrated by Figure 3 where we present the variation of 
D and Dn-1,n with n for N=6,  N=12 and N=100 for the same value of v/U=0.5. Increasing 
v/U we increase the time interval between the emissions of two successive signals, 
increasing the difference between the results furnished by the two available formulas. 
 
3. Doppler shift formula for stationary observer and source in uniform circular motion. 
 
The scenario under consideration involves a stationary observer R and a source S 
performing a uniform circular motion (Figure 4). It has high pedagogical potential 
because during a period of rotation the following typical scenarios are reproduced: 
longitudinal Doppler effect with outgoing source, Doppler effect with an outgoing source 
and oblique incidence of the signals, transversal Doppler effect, Doppler effect with 
incoming source and oblique incidence and, finally, longitudinal Doppler effect with 
incoming source. 
The relative positions of R and S are presented in Figure 4, at time tS, considering that at 
tS=0, S is located in front of R.  At time tS the distance between R and S is given by

where we allow a continuous variation for n. 
In order to compare the results obtained working with Equation (27) (non-locality 
assumption) or with Equation (28) (locality assumption), we present in Figure 5 the 
variation of D and Dn-1,n with n for the same value v/U=0.5 and three different values of 
N (6,12,100). As expected, increasing N decreases the difference between the results 
furnished by the two Equations, as high values of N favor locality. 
 
4. Conclusions 
 
The study of two different Doppler shift experiments involving a stationary receiver and 
source in periodic motion (harmonic oscillatory motion and uniform circular motion) 
shows that we can derive a Doppler shift formula in the “very small period assumption” 
(two successive signals are emitted from the same point in space and a Doppler shift 
formula which takes into account the fact that two successive signals are emitted from 
two different points in space). In the latter case, the Doppler shift formulas are 
parameterized, being expressed as a function of the order number of the emitted signals. 
Increasing the emission frequency diminishes the difference between the results furnished 
by the two formulas.  
We consider that it is necessary to make a net distinction between the locality and the 
non-locality assumptions, not only from a pedagogical, but also from a practical point of 
view.

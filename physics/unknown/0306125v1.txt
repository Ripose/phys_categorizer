Abstract 

 
A PEM fuel cell was specially constructed to determine kinetics under conditions of well-
defined gas phase composition and cell temperature.  Steady state multiplicity was 
discovered in the autohumidification PEM fuel cell, resulting from a balance between 
water production and water removal.   Ignition was observed in the PEM fuel cell for a 
critical water activity of ~0.1.  Ignition is a consequence of the exponential increase of 
proton conductivity with water activity, which creates an autocatalytic feedback between 
the water production and the proton conduction.  The steady state current in the ignited 
state decreases with increasing temperature between 50-105°C.  At temperatures of 
>70°C five steady states were observed in the PEM fuel cell.  The steady state 
performance has been followed with variable load resistance and hysteresis loops have 
been mapped.  The dynamics of transitions between steady states are slow ~103 – 104 s.  
These slow dynamics are suggested to result from a coupling of mechanical and chemical 
properties of the membrane electrode assembly due to swelling of the membrane with 
water absorption.

I. INTRODUCTION 
 
Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are hydrogen fuel cells, where protons 
are conducted through an ionic polymer (ionomers).  The original PEM fuel cells were 
based on polystyrene sulfonate.  Since the early 1990’s PEM fuel cells have employed 
fluorinated polymers functionalized with perfluorosulfonic acid groups such as DuPont’s 
Nafion.  The basic function of the fuel cell is illustrated in Figure 1.  The polymer 
electrolyte membrane serves as a medium for protons to be transported from the anode to 
the cathode.

at the cathode, are reduced and react 
with the protons to produce water.  
The product water is absorbed into 
the PEM, or evaporates into the gas 
streams at the anode and cathode.

 The proton conductivity is nearly independent of temperature when expressed as a 
function of water activity (water activity aw={water pressure/vapor pressure of 
water}Pw/Po=RH/100).  The physical basis for proton conductivity can be explained as 
follows.  At low water activity the PEM absorbs water that ionizes the sulfonic acid 
groups, which liberates protons that can hop between the fixed anions.  The distance 
between ionized sites decreases with water uptake.  Hopping frequency depends 
exponentially on distance so the proton conductivity increases exponentially with water 
activity.  As the water activity increases and more water is taken up by the membrane the 
hydrophilic regions of the PEM swell gradually decreasing the resistance to proton 
transport in the membrane.  Theoretical models have been fit to the proton conductivity 
due to membrane swelling. (water activity > 0.15).(Hsu and Gierke 1982; Eikerling, 
Kornyshev et al. 1997; Thampan, Malhotra et al. 2000; Paddison 2001)

Membrane humidification is essential for a PEM fuel cell.  If the membrane is not 
adequately humidified the proton conductivity will decrease, and the current output for 
the fuel cell will decrease proportionately.  At the other extreme too much water will 
flood the electrodes, hindering gas transport to the membrane/electrode interface. The 
natural question from a chemical reactor viewpoint is what is the optimal level of water 
in the fuel cell, and how can we control that level.  If humidification of the feed streams 
is required and how should the flow rates of the feed gases be adjusted to maintain 
adequate humidification in the polymer membrane?   Additionally, how should the gas 
flow rates be adjusted as the load resistor on the fuel cell changes and alters the rate of 
water production? 
 
The general approach to PEM fuel cell operation is to fix the humidity of the feed gases 
to the fuel cell near 100% relative humidity fixing the water content of the membrane.  
This approach treats water activity of the membrane as an adjustable parameter.  
However, water activity in a PEM fuel cell is a dynamic variable not an adjustable 
parameter.  The fuel cell produces water, and the amount of water produced varies with 
the resistive load on the fuel cell.  We treat the water activity as a system variable 
depending on the system parameters: the load resistance of the fuel cell, the temperature 
of the cell, the flow rates of the gases to the anode and cathode, and the humidity of the 
feed gases.

To elucidate the operation of a PEM fuel cell, we have constructed a simplified fuel cell 
reactor based on the concept of a stirred tank reactor borrowed from chemical 
engineering.  The gas spaces above the anode and cathode, as shown in Figure 1, are 
designed for compositional uniformity, which permits the direct measurement of the 
reaction rate (current) as a function of the gas phase compositions at the anode and 
cathode. 
 
We initiated our studies on the PEM fuel cell reactor kinetics with the simplest case 
possible: no humidification of the feed gases (autohumidification).  The product water 
from the fuel cell reaction hydrates the membrane.  We have operated PEM fuel cells 
continuously in the autohumidification mode for over 5000 hours (over 6 months!).  We 
report here the conditions for steady state operation of a PEM autohumidification fuel 
cell, and demonstrate steady state multiplicity associated with ignition and extinction 
phenomena.  We also report results where 5 steady states exist (three of them stable).   
 
II. EXPERIMENTAL 
 
A schematic of the fuel cell for the kinetic studies in shown in Figure 3.  The membrane-
electrode-assembly (MEA) was pressed between two machined graphite plates and sealed 
with a silicon rubber gasket.  Gas plenums of volume, V, of ~0.2 cm3 were machined in 
graphite plates above a membrane area of ~1.5 cm2.  There were several pillars matched 
between the two plates to apply uniform pressure to the MEA.  Hydrogen and oxygen 
were supplied from commercial cylinders (Airco) through mass flow controllers at flow 
rates, Q, of 1-10 sccm (mL/min).  The residence times of the reactants in the gas plenums 
(V/Q) were greater than the characteristic diffusion time (V2/3/D), assuring uniformity of 
the gas compositions.  The cell temperature was controlled by placing the graphite plates 
between aluminum plates fitted with cartridge heaters connected to a temperature 
controller.  The entire fuel cell assembly was mounted inside an aluminum box to 
maintain better temperature uniformity. 
 
Pressure was maintained in the cell by placing spring loaded pressure relief valves 
(Swagelok) at the outlets.  Tees were placed in the outlet lines (inside the aluminum box) 
with relative humidity sensors in the dead legs of the tees.  The water content of the outlet 
streams was measured with humidity sensors (Honeywell HIH 3610), and the 
temperature at the humidity sensor was measured with a thermocouple in the gas line.  
The relative humidity sensors had to be sufficiently heated to avoid liquid condensation 
on the capacitive sensing element, but they also had to be kept below 85° to protect the 
amplifier circuit on the sensor chip.  
 
The membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) consisted of a Nafion 115 membrane 
pressed between 2 E-tek electrodes (these consist of a carbon cloth coated on one side 
with a Pt/C catalyst).  The catalyst weight loading was 0.4 mg/cm2.  The electrodes were 
brushed with ~4 mg Nafion/cm2 of solubilized Nafion solution before placing the 
membrane between them.  The assembly was hot pressed at 130°C and 10 MPa. Copper 
foils were pressed against the graphite plates and copper wires were attached to connect 
to the external load resistor.  The current and voltage across the load resistor were 

 

4 

  

measured as the load resistance was varied.  A 10-turn 0-20 Ω potentiometer was 
connected in series with a 10-turn 0-500 Ω potentiometer.  The load resistance was varied 
from 0-20 Ω to obtain a polarization curve (IV).  To examine the low current range of the 
polarization curve the resistance would be increased over the range of 0-500 Ω.  The 
voltage across the load resistor was read directly by a DAQ board.  The current through 
the load resistor was passed through a 0.2 ohm sensing resistor and the differential 
voltage across the sensing resistor was amplified by a factor of 100 with an Analog 
Devices AMP02 Instrumentation Amplifier and read by the DAQ board.  An IV curve 
was typically collected and stored in ~ 100s.

aluminum plates with cartridge heaters for temperature control. 
 
Relative humidity measurements were taken intermittently for steady state conditions.  
Water condensation and/or temperatures above 80°C adversely affected the relative 
humidity sensors.  A number of relative humidity sensors were destroyed at low gas 
flows when the water condensed on the sensors.  Operating the cell at high pressures 
frequently resulted in water condensation on the humidity sensors.  For these reasons we 
chose to limit our initial studies to atmospheric pressure.  The temperature at the 
humidity sensors were below the cell temperature; at a cell temperature of 100°C the 
temperature at the sensors was ~65°C.   We corrected the relative humidity measurements 
for gas flow rate, reactant conversion and temperature to determine the water removal 
rates.

III. RESULTS 
 
Three different types of measurements were taken in our studies: 

a.  The steady state currents and voltages, and water removal in the anode and 

cathode streams were measured at variable load resistances and cell temperatures 
from 35-105°C with fixed flow rates of 10 mL/min of O2 and H2.  These are time-
consuming experiments as steady state required several hours to be established. 
b.  Polarization data were obtained as functions of the flow rates of O2 at the cathode 
and H2 at the anode and cell temperature.  In these experiments steady state would 
be obtained for a fixed load resistance and then the load resistance was varied 
over a short period of time with all other parameters fixed. 

c.  Dynamic measurements of the cell current and voltage, and the relative humidity 
at the anode and cathode were followed during start-up of the fuel cell, and/or 
changing the load resistance.   

 

These different experimental measurements illuminate the operation of the 
autohumidification PEM fuel cell as a chemical reactor.  Care must be exercised in 
interpreting results from the fuel cell operation.  Steady state is limited by the full 
equilibration of the membrane with the gas phase and the reaction rate (cell current).  The 
membrane has a large capacity for water relative to the gas volume in the fuel cell.  From 
our dynamic measurements we observed it took 103-104 s for a cell to achieve steady 
state. Most polarization curves were obtained in <102 s corresponding to a fixed level of 
membrane hydration.   
 
III.1.Fuel Cell Start-up and Ignition 
 
The start-up of an autohumidification PEM fuel cell was examined as a function of the 
initial water content of the Nafion membrane.  The polymer membrane was dried by 
flowing dry oxygen through the cathode chamber at ~100 mL/min and dry nitrogen 
through the anode chamber at ~100 mL/min for ~12 hours.  To humidify the membrane, 
the oxygen flow was shut off, and the nitrogen flow to the anode was passed through a 
water bubbler at room temperature.  The relative humidity was measured at the outlet of 
the anode as a function of time to estimate the water uptake by the membrane.  After 
hydrating the membrane to the desired level, the nitrogen flow was stopped.  The fuel cell 
was heated to 50°C and the temperature was allowed to stabilize for ~ 1 hour.  Hydrogen 
flow at 10 mL/min to the anode and oxygen flow at 10 mL/min to the cathode were 
established, and the current through the load resistor (set at 5 Ω) was measured as a 
function of time.   
 
Figure 4 shows the current of the PEM fuel cell during startup.  In Figure 4A the 
membrane was hydrated to different levels.  The parameter λ is the number of water 
molecules taken up per sulfonic acid group in the Nafion membrane.  The maximum 
water uptake has been measured in separate experiments and is ~12.  (Springer, 
Zawodzinski et al. 1991; Thampan, Malhotra et al. 2000; Yang 2003)  The results show 
classic ignition phenomena.  For initial water loadings of <1.5 H2O/SO3 the fuel cell 
approaches an extinguished state, where the steady state current is very low (~0.1 mA).  

 

6 

  

When the initial water loading is >1.5 H2O/SO3 the fuel cell “ignites” and approaches a 
“high current” steady state current of ~ 125 mA. Ignition and extinction was also 
observed at other temperatures ranging from 35-105°C but we have not yet carried out a 
systematic investigation of the critical number of water molecules for ignition at those 
conditions.

Figure 4A.  Start-up of an autohumidification PEM 
fuel cell with different initial membrane water 
loading (λ=water molecules per SO3).  The fuel cell 
was run at 50ºC after initial humidification at 25ºC 
for varying periods of time.  The external resistance 
was 5 Ω. 
 
Figure 4B shows the startup of the autohumidification fuel cell from the same hydration 
state with two different load resistances.  At the higher load resistance the current is 
limited in the external circuit.  Limiting the current reduces the production of water in the 
fuel cell.  Water is removed by convection in the effluents from the anode and cathode.  
If the fuel cell is unable to produce enough water to sustain the hydration level in the 
membrane the fuel cell current is extinguished. 
 
III.2.Steady State Operation of an Autohumidification PEM Fuel Cell 
 
Having established that a PEM fuel cell may be ignited and operated in the 
autohumidification mode, the steady state operation was examined as the temperature and 
load resistance were varied at fixed reactant flow.  The hydrogen flow to the anode and 
oxygen flow to the cathode were both set to 10 mL/min (6770 nmol/s).  The fuel cell 
temperature was set to the desired temperatures between 35-105°C, and the external 
resistance was set to 0.2 ohms.  After allowing the fuel cell current to stabilize for several 
hours, the load resistance was set to 0.5 Ω and the fuel cell was allowed to stabilize for 1 
hour.  Normally the current would stabilize in ~1 minute, but we always waited for 1 
hour to establish steady state.  The relative humidity readings at the anode and cathode 
generally stabilized in less than 5 minutes.  After recording the steady state current, and 
relative humidities the load resistance was increased by 2-3 Ω and the process was 
repeated.  After increasing the load resistance to 15 Ω the fuel cell was allowed to 
stabilize an additional 12 hours to verify that the current and relative humidities were at 

 

7 

  

steady state.  A complete series of steady state measurements at a single temperature took 
a minimum of 3 days. 
 
The relative humidity readings (RH) of the effluents from the anode and cathode were 
converted to mole fractions through global mass balances. The molar flow rates of the 
feed are Fin(mole/s), i is the cell current (Amperes), F is Faraday’s constant 
(coulomb/mole), and ξ is the fraction of water formed at the cathode that exits in the 
anode effluent.

Equations (1) are solved for consistency of the value of ξ for the relative humidity at the 
anode and the cathode.  In all cases reported here the water was nearly equally partitioned 
between the anode effluent and the cathode effluent.  Equipartitioning indicates that the 
water formed at the cathode equilibrates with the membrane and there is only a small 
gradient in water concentration across the membrane.  The water removal rates at the 
anode and cathode are given by the molar flows of the effluents multiplied by the mole 
fraction of water in the effluent streams, and are given by equation 2.

Table I summarizes the steady state current, and water removal from both the anode and 
cathode as functions of the load resistance, and temperature.  All these data are steady 
states – the fuel cell was operated in excess of 24 hours for the conditions tabulated to 
verify steady state operation.  In particular the conditions at 95º and 105ºC were tested 
continuously for over 100 hours to verify the steady state operation.  The results in Table 
I  show that the PEM fuel cell was operated in an autohumidification mode over a wide 
temperature range (35-105ºC), with varying load resistances.  All these steady states can 
be characterized as “ignited” except for operation at 105ºC with a 15 Ω load resistance, 
where the fuel cell current is extinguished.

III.3.Fuel Cell Operation with Variable Reactant Flow Rates. 
 
The variables under operator control in the autohumidification PEM fuel cell are the load 
resistance, the fuel cell temperature, and the gas flow rates through the anode and cathode 
chambers.  Steady state operation at fixed flow rates was reported above.  Fuel cell 
operation as a function of reactant flow rates was characterized by the polarization curves 
at different temperatures.  The polarization curve is the typical method of characterizing 
fuel cell performance.  However, the polarization curves generally do not represent 
steady state performance of a PEM fuel cell.  It takes approximately 103 s for the 
membrane hydration to equilibrate with a change in the water production at the cathode.  
Unless the polarization curve was taken with small changes in the external load over the 
period of many hours the fuel cell will not be operating at steady state.   If the 
polarization curve is taken in a period of ≤100 s the water content in the membrane will 
be approximately constant.  The polarization curve under these conditions represents a 
constant level of membrane hydration, but this is not steady state.   
 
Fuel cell operation with variable reactant flow rates was examined under conditions 
where the level of membrane hydration was kept approximately constant.  After setting 

9 

  

the fuel cell temperature, the hydrogen and oxygen flow rates were both set to 10 
mL/min.   The load resistance was adjusted to 0.5 ohm, and the fuel cell was run for 12 
hours to establish steady state.  The reactant flow rates were then adjusted to the desired 
conditions and the fuel cell operation was allowed to stabilize for 5 minutes.  The load 
resistance was varied from 0.2-20 ohms in 100 s while the current through the load 
resistor and the voltage across the load resistor were measured.   A typical polarization 
curve from the autohumidification fuel cell is shown in Figure 5A.  The same data can be 
presented as a Power Performance Curve, where the power delivered to the load resistor 
(IV) is plotted as a function of the load resistance (V/I).  Two key engineering variables 
of the PEM fuel cell are identified from the power performance curve, shown in Figure 
5B.  There is a clear maximum in the power from the fuel cell.  The load resistance at the 
maximum power is equal to the effective internal resistance of the membrane-electrode-
assembly at the operating conditions.  (This equivalence is shown in the Appendix).

From the power performance curve we identify three figures of merit for comparing PEM 
fuel cell performance at different operating conditions, 
fuel cell current at fixed load resistance 
maximum power at specified reactant flow rates and cell temperature 
load resistance at maximum power

Figure 6 shows the cell current as a function of the reactant gas flow rates for a load 
resistance of 5 Ω and cell temperature of 70ºC.  At fixed oxygen flow the fuel cell current 
increased with hydrogen flow and plateaued.  The cell current plateaued at ~120 mA for  
H2 flow rates > 3 ml/min.  The cell current was nearly independent of H2 flow when the 
H2 utilization was  < 30%.  Figure 6B shows that the fuel cell current was insensitive to 
the oxygen flow rate at fixed hydrogen flow for oxygen flow rates > 1 mL/min (this was 
also evident in Figure 6A where all three data sets at different O2 flow rates fell on top of 
each other).  These conditions correspond to oxygen utilization <50%.

We did not make quantitative measurements of the dynamic response of current to 
changes in flow rates, but we did make semiquantitative observations.  The fuel cell 
current responded rapidly, within seconds, to changes in the hydrogen flow rate, but the 
current responded more sluggishly to changes in the oxygen flow rate.  The current shut 
off within seconds of stopping the hydrogen flow, whereas it took more than a minute for 
the current to shut off when the oxygen flow was stopped.  Experiments at 55ºC and 
85ºC, were qualitatively identical to the results shown in Figure 6 for 70ºC. The current 
plateau achieved at different feed stoichiometries with a 5 Ω load resistance is 
documented in Table II.   The maximum currents at 55ºC were approximately the same as 
at 70ºC, while the maximum currents were approximately 10 mA lower at 85ºC than at 
70ºC. Because these measurements were not at steady state there is s

We can get information about the hydration state of the membrane and the effects of flow 
rates on membrane dehydration from the Power Performance Curves.  The Power 
Performance Curves give the maximum power and effective MEA resistance at the given 
feed flow rates and fuel cell temperature.  Figures 7 and 8 plot the maximum cell power 
and the resistance at maximum power as functions of the flow rates at 85ºC.  The results 
are very similar at 55ºC and 70ºC.  The principal difference is that the maximum power

output is slightly higher at the lower temperatures and the effective MEA resistances are 
slightly lower at the lower temperatures.

Figure 8A.  Maximum Power from 
Autohumidification PEM fuel cell at 85ºC as a 
function of the O2 flow rate for fixed H2 flow rates as 
noted.   
 
Figure 7 shows two trends.  When the oxygen flow is fixed, the maximum power 
saturates when the feed is fuel rich (H2/O2>2).  Increasing the H2/O2 ratio beyond 
stoichiometric does not affect the maximum power, but increasing the total flow rate for 
the same stoichiometry resulted in increased power output.  Second, the effective MEA 
resistance decreases with increased H2 flow and plateaus when the feed is H2 rich.  Two 
effects combine to produce the highest power output.  At high oxygen flow 
(substoichiometric feed), water is removed at the cathode faster, reducing the water 
content of the membrane.  A low hydrogen flow limits the water production, again 
reducing the water content of the membrane.  These effects are illustrated in Figure 7B 
where the MEA resistance increased dramatically at the lowest hydrogen flow rates and 
highest oxygen flow rates.  At all the conditions represented in Figures 7 and 8 the 
utilization of the reactants at the maximum power production is always less than 40%, so 
the large increase in effective MEA resistance cannot be explained by depletion of the 
hydrogen.     

 

12 

  

 
 
The key trend shown in Figure 8 is that neither the power production nor the effective 
MEA resistance is very sensitive to the oxygen flow.  The power increases with increased 
hydrogen flow, but is nearly constant with oxygen flow.  At the lowest hydrogen flow 
rate the MEA resistance increases with O2 flow probably the result of greater water loss 
from the cathode side of the membrane. 
 
The results presented in this section provide guidance concerning the effects of reactant 
flow rates and temperatures on the water production rate in PEM fuel cells.  However, 
unlike the results presented in the previous section, the cell currents and the membrane-
electrode-assembly resistances are not steady-state measurements.  We did not report any 
relative humidity measurements in this section because they were gradually changing 
during the course of the measurements of the polarization curves.  The data presented in 
this section were obtained fast enough that the relative humidity at the anode or cathode 
did not change more than 5%, so the rate data correspond to “constant water content” in 
the membrane, fixed temperature and flow rates of the reactants.   
 
III.4. Steady-state Multiplicity 
 
Results for ignition/extinction phenomena with the autohumidification PEM fuel cell 
were reported in section III.1.  The ignited state could be extinguished by increasing the 
load resistance limiting the water production.  It was expected that increasing the cell 
temperature would increase the rate of water removal and would also extinguish the fuel 
cell.  As we report here in more detail, the behavior was not that simple. 
 
The autohumidification PEM fuel cell was operated at steady state at 95ºC with a feed of 
10 mL/min H2 and 10 mL/min O2 and a load resistance of 2.5 Ω.  The steady state current 
was ~175 mA and was sustained over several days of operation. The current-voltage 
response of the fuel cell in a constant state of hydration was obtained in a period of 100 s. 
The polarization curve and Power Performance Curve at this state of membrane hydration 
are shown in Figure 9A and 9B respectively.  We refer to this steady state as a high water 
content state as the effective MEA resistance is low corresponding to a high level of 
membrane hydration. The load resistance was increased to 20 Ω and the current was 
recorded as a function of time for a period of 8 hours (see Figure 10).  The current 
dropped from 175 mA to 38 mA within seconds and then continued to decrease to a value 
of 35 mA after 300 s.  The current showed a very slow decline of about 1 mA over the 
next 10,000 s, then showed a steeper decline of 3.5 mA over a period of 3000 s, and 
finally remained stable at a current of 31 mA for a period of 2 days.  After 2 days a 
second set of current-voltage data was taken and the resulting polarization curve and 
Power Performance Curves are also shown in Figure 9.  This final state is referred to as 
the low water content state; it has a higher MEA resistance corresponding to a lower level 
of membrane hydration.  
 
The direction of the load resistance change was reversed.  Steady state operation of the 
fuel cell operating was established with the load resistance set to 25 Ω.  The current-

voltage response of the fuel cell was recorded at a constant hydration level; the 
polarization curve and Power Performance Curve fell directly on top of the low water 
content curves previously recorded and shown in Figure 9.    The load resistance was 
reduced to 7 ohms and the current was recorded as a function of time (Figure 10B).  The 
current jumped immediately from 25 mA to 65 mA when the load resistance was 
decreased.  The current remained steady for almost 1500 s, and then jumped to 87 mA, 
where it remained steady for a period of more than 24 hours.  The current-voltage 
response of the fuel cell was recorded.  The polarization curve recorded after the new 
steady state was established fell almost directly on top of the polarization curve for the 
high water content shown in Figure 9A.

These transitions between steady states were repeated five times over a period of two 
weeks and were highly reproducible.  The transitions between the two steady states were 
examined in more detail.  The relative humidity at the cathode and anode was monitored 
simultaneous with the current after changing the external load resistance.  Those results 
are shown in Figure 11.  The relative humidity at both the anode and cathode jumped at 
concurrently with the jumps of the fuel cell current.  When the current increased in 
response to decreasing the load resistance, the relative humidity at the cathode increased 
almost instantaneously, and the relative humidity at the anode increased with a time lag 
of ~100s.  When the cell current was constant the relative humidity at the anode and 
cathode remained constant. And when the current jump after 1500 s, the relative humidity 
at the anode and cathode jumped in tandem.  (The relative humidities shown in Figure 11

are the measured values at the sensors; these values have not been corrected for the 
temperature difference between the fuel cell and the sensor, the effluent flow rates, and 
the water partitioning between the anode and cathode.  Those corrections are complex for 
transient behavior.  Unfortunately, we did not have good measurements of the 
temperatures at the relative humidity sensors during these experiments so we do not 
attempt to report corrected values. However, the absolute values are not critical – the 
temporal correlation between relative humidity and fuel cell current is the essential 
feature we want to report here.)

The relative humidity measurements also tracked the cell current when the experiment 
was switched from a low load resistance to a high load resistance.  The single difference 
observed was the anode relative humidity appeared to decrease prior to the decrease in 
the cell current and the humidity at the cathode. 
 
A series of measurements were taken examining the transitions between the “high water 
content” and “low water content” steady states.  We started from a low resistance, with 
the fuel cell operating in the high water content steady state (so named because the MEA 
resistance is lower and the relative humidity at the anode and cathode are higher).  The 
current-voltage response of the fuel cell was recorded.  The polarization curve and the 
Power Performance Curve were plotted.  The resistance was incrementally increased and 
the fuel cell current was allowed to stabilize over a period of 2 hours, after which another 
polarization curve was obtained.  If the resistance of the MEA as determined from the 
maximum of the Power Performance Curve did not change by more than 0.2 ohm the 
load resistance was increased and the process was repeated.  This process was used to 
find the load resistance at which a jump is observed in the MEA resistance.  This 
procedure was employed to identify the critical load resistance where the fuel cell jumped 
from the high water content steady state to the low water content steady state.   
 
This procedure was then reversed, starting from a high load resistance with the fuel cell 
operating in the low water content steady state the load resistance was decreased until the 
MEA resistance showed a large decrease indicative of the transition to the high water 
content steady state.  The critical load resistances where the membrane transitions 
between a high and low humidification state are shown in Figure 12 for the 
autohumidification fuel cell.  At load resistances between the two critical points the fuel 
cell could operate stably in either of two steady states, depending on how the steady state 
was approached.  This is a classic hysteresis phenomenon associated with the existence of 
multiple stable steady states. 
 
Measurements to identify the hysteresis loop were repeated at 50,65,80, and 95ºC.  Two 
stable steady states were only observed at 80º and 95ºC; at 65º and 50ºC only one stable 
steady state was observed in our studies.  The hysteresis loops at 80º and 95ºC are shown 
in Figure 12.  The critical load resistance to jump from the high water content state to the 
low water content state decreases with increasing temperature; and the critical load 
resistance to jump from the low water content state to the high water content state 
increases with increasing temperature.

resistance (the time the current remained constant after the change in resistance shown in 
Figure 11A).  These are tedious experiments and we have not completed a thorough 
study, but a few results are summarized in Table III.  Two trends emerged:  (i) the greater 
the difference between the critical load resistance and the applied load resistance the 
shorter the time to the jump from the low water content steady state to the high water 
content steady state; (ii) the transition time to jump from the low water content steady 
state to the high water content steady state is faster at lower fuel cell temperature.

IV. DISCUSSION 
 
We have presented a novel experimental approach to PEM fuel cells, treating the fuel cell 
as a flow reactor.  This approach uncovered ignition and multiple steady states in PEM 
fuel cells.  The results also suggest that the transport processes in the membrane electrode 
assembly are not as well understood as previously thought.  The novelty of the 
experimental approach here is that the fuel cell was not a scaled down version of a typical 
PEM fuel cell.  Such fuel cells have long thin flow channels that traverse the 
membrane/electrode interface.  The concentrations of the reactants and the water product 
all vary along the length of these channels, and the current measurements obtained from 
such a fuel cell are integrated values.  The fuel cell employed in the experiments 
presented here operates as a well mixed stirred tank reactor.  The gas phase compositions 
and membrane water content are all uniform, so the model fuel cell has well defined 
compositions.  Although this is not the best configuration for optimal fuel cell 
performance, it is superior to extract the reactor kinetics, and understand the coupling of 
reaction, transport and physio-chemical properties that affect them. 
 
 
IV.1 Steady State Multiplicity in PEM Fuel Cells 
 
The results presented here are contrary to some common assumptions about PEM fuel 
cells.  It is frequently claimed that PEM fuel cells can only function with humidified 
feeds.  Springer et al studied the operation of PEM fuel cells with humidified feeds where 
the humidification of the anode and cathode were varied.(Springer, Zawodzinski et al. 
1991)  Under their conditions they concluded that there was a net flux of water from the 
anode to the cathode due to electro-osmosis, and the PEM fuel cell could only function 
with a humidified hydrogen feed.  This result is widely quoted and prominently stated in 
The Fuel Cell Handbook published by the Department of Energy.(EG&G Services 2000)  
Why were we able to operate a PEM fuel cell in an autohumidification mode?  
 
We are not the first to report autohumidification PEM fuel cells.  There are two previous 
reports we have identified for operation of PEM fuel cells without external 
humidification.(Watanabe, Uchida et al. 1996; Buchi and Srinivasan 1997)  In addition 
there are PEM stacks that have incorporated internal humidification schemes.(H-Power 
began marketing a 500 W PEM stack in 2002 based on autohumidification operation, and 
United Technologies has a system for internal humidification).  Our contribution is the 
identification of the critical parameters and mechanisms for humidity control in a PEM 
fuel cell that allow autohumidification.   
 
We designed and operated our PEM fuel cell to have direct measurement of composition 
at the anode and cathode so composition could be directly correlated with the fuel cell 
current.  A typical PEM fuel cell design has long thin serpentine flow channels at both 
the anode and cathode.  The ratio of diffusive flow to convective flow in those channels, 
characterized by the dispersion number (diffusivity/((linear gas velocity)(channel size) 
=D/ul) is typically low (~10-3).  This is typical of a plug flow tubular reactor (PFR); the 
gas composition varies along the length of the flow channels due to reaction with little 

 

18 

  

axial dispersion due to diffusion.  The measured fuel cell current is an averaged value of 
the local current over the length of the flow channels.  In the PEM fuel cell employed 
here the dispersion number is ~1.  This is typical of a stirred tank reactor (STR); the 
compositions at the anode and cathode are uniform due to diffusive mixing.  The 
measured fuel cell current can be directly related to the gas phase composition at the 
anode and cathode.  The STR fuel cell design employed here is ideal to characterize PEM 
fuel cell kinetics, and to examine cell dynamics.  This is a one-dimensional system, 
which makes the analysis of the kinetics and dynamics much simpler. Results from the 
stirred tank reactor fuel call can easily be employed to model the typical flow channel 
systems in conventional PEM fuel cells. We don’t advocate this as a method of designing 
fuel cells for maximum power density, but it does provide control in a fashion not 
possible in the standard PEM fuel cell design. 
 
We also chose to operate the STR PEM reactor under conditions where the convective 
flows of the reactant gases at the anode and cathode were balanced with the fuel cell 
current.   Fuel cell operation from low to high conversion of the reactants was examined 
by adjusting the external load resistance and the reactant flow.   The advantages of the 
STR PEM fuel cell permitted us to explore details of PEM fuel cell operation that were 
previously unknown.   
 
The STR PEM fuel cell permits direct probing of fuel cell operation with the level of 
hydration of the membrane.  Many previous investigators have noted that with 
insufficient humidification of the PEM fuel cell the fuel cell did not function well and the 
maximum current derived from the fuel cell was very small. (Srinivasan, Manko et al. 
1990; Blomen and Mugerwa 1993; Watanabe, Uchida et al. 1996; Buchi and Srinivasan 
1997) There is a consensus that sufficient humidification of the feed was necessary for 
good operation, but we are aware of no study that has examined what level of 
humidification is necessary.  To identify the necessary level of humidification we looked 
carefully at the initial water content in the membrane.  Figure 4 clearly demonstrates 
critical water content was necessary to get the autohumidification PEM fuel cell to 
“ignite”.  The ignition/extinction phenomena can be easily understood from basic 
reaction engineering analysis. 
 
Ignition and extinction result from balancing water production and water removal in the 
PEM fuel cell.  Consider the mass balances on the hydrogen at the anode, oxygen at the 
cathode and water.  It is assumed that there is no passage of either hydrogen or oxygen 
gases across the membrane.

oxygen feeds in the water balance.  The current, or water production rate depends on the 
effective voltage across the membrane, V', and the resistance of the membrane-electrode-
assembly for proton conduction.  We approximate the effective cell voltage as the open 
circuit voltage less the activation potential, typically V'~0.85 V. The membrane-
electrode-assembly resistance depends principally on the water content or water activity 
in the membrane and at the membrane/electrode interface.  At high current densities or 
high reactant utilization the cell voltage and/or MEA resistance are also affected by mass 
transport resistances across the electrode and the ME interfacial resistance.  Under most 
conditions we studied the mass transport resistances were negligible.  Furthermore the 
membrane resistance changes exponentially with the water activity, which is a much 
larger effect than the changes in cell current due to mass transport resistances.  We will 
neglect the mass transport resistances to the reaction rate and assume that Ohm’s law 
gives the proton current, where the membrane resistance is a function of the water 
activity, Rmembrane(aw), fitted to the experimental results shown in Figure 2.

The water generation, which is ½ the proton current, given by equation 6 is a sigmoidal 
function of water activity in the membrane due to the exponential decrease in resistance 
as a function of water content.  A series of water production curves are traced out for 
different values of the load resistance in Figure 13.  The membrane resistance at a given 
water content shows almost no temperature dependence (see Figure 2), so the water 
generation curves shown in Figure 13 may be considered as independent of temperature.   
 
Steady state is established when the water removed by convection from the anode and 
cathode chambers is balanced by water production at the cathode.  Water vapor transport 
from the membrane to the gas phases at the anode and cathode is an increasing function 
of the water activity in the membrane.  For simplicity we will assume the water activity is 
uniform through the membrane, and the water vapor transport is given by an effective 
mass transfer coefficient that accounts for mass transport resistance across the 
membrane/electrode interface and mass transport through the porous electrode, km, 
multiplied by the water activity in the membrane, aw
at the fuel cell temperature, Po(T).  
 
Water Removal Rate   
 
 
The water removal curve corresponds to a straight line through the origin in Figure 13. 
The slope of that line increases with increasing temperature as the vapor pressure of 
water increases with temperature.

Water Activity (Pw/Po)

Figure 13.  Water production (fuel cell current) and water removal rates for an auto-humidification PEM 
fuel cell.  The water production is shown as a function of the external load resistance, and is defined by 
equation 6.  The membrane resistance was an empirical fit of the data in Figure 2. The water removal line is 
given by equation 7, and the line shown corresponds to a cell temperature of 50ºC.  The intersections of the 
water production curves and the water removal line represent steady states. The intersection near zero 
current density is an extinguished state, and the intersection at the higher current density of ~ 0.1 A/cm2 is 
the ignited state.  There is also an intersection of the water production and water removal curves around 
water activity of 0.08 and 0.015 A/cm2.  This is an unstable steady state.  
 
Depending on the load resistance there exist either one or three intersections of the water 
production and water removal curves; these intersections correspond to steady states 
where water production is balanced by water removal.  At high load resistance, R=20 Ω, 
there is only be a single low conversion steady state.  At lower load resistances, 
R=6,8,10 Ω, there are three intersections of the water removed and water generated 
corresponding to three steady states.  Increasing the cell temperature will increase the 
slope of the water removal line, and the range of load resistances for which three steady 
states occur will be shifted to lower resistances. 
 
When three steady states exist only two of them are stable.  At both the low and high 
current, fluctuations away from the steady state will result in the system returning to it.  
For example, at the high conversion a fluctuation increasing the water content in the 
membrane will result in the water removal being greater than the water generated, so the 
water content of the membrane will decrease returning the system to steady state.  The 
middle steady state is unstable; positive fluctuations in the water content from that steady 
state will cause the system to generate even more water and move towards the high 
current steady state.  Similarly, negative fluctuations will drive the system towards the 

 

21 

  

low current steady state.  This is precisely what was shown in Figure 4; when the 
membrane water content was greater than a critical valve the system to moved towards 
the high current steady state, and when the water content was below that critical value the 
system moved towards the low current steady state.  There exists a locus of critical initial 
membrane water contents that are a function of load resistance and cell temperature that 
define a separatrix as to what state the fuel cell will evolve.  
 
Steady state multiplicity displayed by the autohumidification PEM fuel cell (Figure 13) is 
analogous to that for an autothermal reactor with an exothermic reaction.(Uppal, Ray et 
al. 1974; Schmitz 1976)  Steady state multiplicity in the autothermal reactor arises from 
positive feedback between a reaction product, heat, and the reaction rate.  Heat from 
reaction raises the temperature, which facilitates further reaction.  The feedback 
mechanism in the autohumidification PEM fuel is unique; the reaction product, water, 
facilitates a transport process (proton conduction), and only indirectly facilitates the 
reaction rate. 
 
Figure 13 elucidates the ignition phenomena observed in Figure 4.  The water removal 
line intersects the water production lines for the unstable steady state at aw=0.08.  When 
the initial water content of the membrane was below that in equilibrium with aw=0.08 the 
water removal exceeds water production and the fuel cell extinguishes.  At aw=0.08 the 
water content in the membrane is ~1.5-1.6 water molecules/SO3. (Yang 2003) The 
critical water loading for PEM ignition should be ~1.5-1.6 water molecules/SO3, as 
observed. Figure 13 also reveals that above a critical load resistance of ~ 20 Ω the water 
production curve is always below the water removal curve; the fuel cell will never ignite 
if the load is too great.  The results displayed in Figure 4 show the fuel cell was 
extinguished when the load resistance was increased to 30 Ω.   
 
Figure 13 provides a good qualitative account of ignition and multiple steady states in an 
autohumidification PEM fuel cell.  A fully quantitative model will require a more 
detailed understanding of mass transfer resistances, electrode kinetics and membrane 
properties beyond our current understanding.   
 
The model presented here is only valid for water activity < 1; it is limited to cases where 
only water vapor are present.  Closer examination of Figure 13 suggests that at 
sufficiently low load resistance the ignited state would correspond to a water activity >1.  
This condition has been observed experimentally.  When water production exceeds its 
removal by convection liquid water will condense in the fuel cell.  Liquid water 
condenses in the pores of the electrode inhibiting mass transport of hydrogen and oxygen 
to the membrane/electrode interface and the current drops precipitously.  After the 
flooding occurs the water removal by convection exceeds water production and 
eventually the gas flow removes enough water to permit the gases to more easily get to 
the membrane/electrode interface and the current increases.  This creates a chaotic 
variation in the cell current over time.  We observed such chaotic phenomena at a cell 
temperature of 35 C with a load resistance of 0.2 ohm, but have not yet characterized the 
details of the PEM fuel cell performance in this range of operating parameters.

IV.2 Water Transport in PEM Fuel Cells 
 
Water partitioning from the effluent streams in the autohumidification PEM fuel cell was 
surprising.  Based on past studies, such as those of Springer et al (Springer, Zawodzinski 
et al. 1991; Watanabe, Uchida et al. 1996; Buchi and Srinivasan 1997), we expected to 
see substantially more water in the cathode effluent than the anode effluent.  Instead the 
water removal was nearly equal from both sides of the fuel cell.  Water is made at the 
cathode/membrane interface.  Water must diffuse through both the membrane and the 
porous anode to exit in the anode effluent.  Water exiting from the cathode only diffuses 
through the porous cathode.  The anode and cathode were identical in the PEM fuel cell 
employed here.   The near equal partitioning of the water product indicates that the 
resistance to water diffusion in the electrodes must be greater than the resistance to water 
diffusion across the membrane. 
 
 
IV.3. Rate dependence on Reactant Concentrations 
 
There is a paucity of data relating the local gas composition at the anode and cathode to 
the fuel cell current.  A number of studies have examined detailed electrode kinetics in 
well-defined systems.  Our particular interest is to determine the dependence of the fuel 
cell current depends on the concentration of hydrogen at the anode and the concentration 
of oxygen at the cathode in the presence of the various mass transport resistances. 
 
The results presented in Figure 6 showed there was little dependence of the fuel cell 
current on the flow rates of the reactants above as long as the utilization of the reactant 
was below 30% for hydrogen and 50% for oxygen.  Figure 14 replots the data from 
Figure 6 but showing how the cell current depended on the partial pressure of the 
reactants at the anode and cathode.  Figure 14A shows the cell current is nearly 
independent of oxygen pressure at the cathode over the range of 0.5-1 bar, when the 
hydrogen pressure at the anode is fixed.  Both Figures 14A and 14B show the fuel cell 
current decreases with decreasing hydrogen pressure at the anode.  The decrease in 
current is greater than anticipated based on thermodynamics, if all other parameters were 
fixed.  These data are consistent with a kinetic limitation to reaction at the cathode, in 
agreement with other investigations. 
 
The results presented here show that the fuel cell current is independent of oxygen 
pressure at the cathode over a wide range of oxygen pressures.  The constancy of the 
reaction rate or current over such a broad range of reactant pressures simplifies the 
operation and control of the PEM fuel cell.   
 
The PEM fuel cell operation does show substantial variation in the current with the 
hydrogen pressure at the anode.  More data is needed to understand this better.  The data 
suggest that protons and oxygen anions may be competing for adsorption sites on the 
cathode; high oxygen pressure at the cathode and low hydrogen pressure at the anode 
result in reduced proton activity and reduced reaction at the cathode.  The data do 
indicate that at moderate to high utilization factors for hydrogen the fuel cell current falls 

 

23 

  

below the thermodynamic predictions.  In high area fuel cells with long flow channels 
accounting for the variation in reaction rates at the cathode along the length of the flow 
channel will be necessary.

IV. 4. Existence of 5 Steady States 
 
We initiated our work with the autohumidification PEM fuel cell expecting to observe 
three steady as illustrated in Figure 13.  We were surprised to discover the existence of a 
third stable steady state.  We have analyzed the experimental data to construct the water 
balance that accounts for five steady states.  The water production curves show stepwise 
changes in the membrane resistance that has pointed to an explanation for the five steady 
states. 
 
The steady state currents and membrane resistances as functions of load resistance and 
the hysteresis loops were used to construct the water production curve for conditions 
when three stable steady state exist.  The procedure for construction of the water 
production curve at 95ºC is shown in Figure 15A. The steady state currents at different 
load resistances are shown as horizontal lines.  For load resistances of 0.9 – 6.4 Ω the 
stable steady state corresponded to the high membrane water content branch; these states 
designated by the solid horizontal lines at the upper right side of Figure 15A.   At load 
resistances of 12.6 – 25.4 Ω only the low membrane water content branch was stable; 
these are designated by solid horizontal lines at the bottom left of Figure 15A.  When the 

 

24 

  

load resistance was between 8 and 12 Ω either the high or low branch was stable, 
depending on the direction of approach.  This middle region corresponds to where the 
hysteresis loop was observed; dashed horizontal lines designate those states.  
 
There are two ignition points.  The first ignition goes from the extinguished fuel cell 
operation to operation in the low water content branch.  The second ignition point 
transitions between the low membrane water content state and the high membrane water 
content state.  The first ignition point corresponds to the water activity in the membrane 
required for autohumidification; this was previously identified at a water activity of 0.08 
(see Figure 13).  The second ignition point can be bounded based on the water activity of 
the membrane of the low and high water content states.  The membrane resistances of the 
high and low water content states can be obtained from the resistance at maximum power 
of the Power Performance Curve.  The second ignition point must occur at a water 
activity greater than the water activity of the low water content state and less than the 
water activity of the high water content state.  For a 10 Ω load resistance, the low water 
content state had an MEA resistance of 3.6 Ω (ρ=150 Ω-cm) and the high water content 
state had an MEA resistance of 1.2 Ω (ρ=50 Ω-cm).  Based on the conductivity as a 
function of water activity in the membrane (Figure 2), this bounds the water activity of 
the second ignition point in the range of 0.25-0.35.     
 
The experimentally determined MEA resistances of the low water content state and the 
high water content state were nearly constant (within 10%), independent of the load 
resistance.   To fit the steady state current data as a function of load resistance water 
production curves must rise rapidly from zero to a horizontal segment corresponding to 
the low water content state, then a second rapid rise at the second ignition point followed 
by another horizontal segment corresponding to the high water content state.  The water 
generation curves was empirically fit using equation 6 the water production, and 
expressing the membrane resistivity,ρ (Ω-cm), with equation 8, and are shown in Figure 
15B.

The water removal curve is a straight line from the origin.  It can be fixed by finding the 
intersection with the water production curves. For load resistances between 8-12 Ω the 
water removal line must intersect the water production curves at both the low and the 
high water content steady states.  This is sufficient to fix the water removal line as shown 
in Figure 15B.

Water Activity in Membrane (Pw/Po)

Figure 15B.  Water production and water removal for an 
autohumidification PEM fuel cell at 95ºC.  The water 
generation curves were based on equation 6, with the 
membrane resistivity given by equation 8. 

Figure 15A.  Construction of the water generation curves 
for the autohumidification PEM fuel cell.  The horizontal 
lines represent the experimentally observed steady state 
currents.  First and second ignition ranges were set by 
limits on the membrane water activity for the low and 
high water content steady states.   
   
Figure 15B explains the origin of the hysteresis loops presented in Figure 12.  Consider a 
fuel cell operating at steady state with a load resistance of 1 Ω; the fuel cell will be in the 
high water content steady state with a cell current of 220 mA.  Increasing the load 
resistance to 2 ohms will result in a decrease in the cell current to 175 mA, but the cell 
continues to operate in the high water content state.  As the load resistance is increased to 
8 Ω the current will decrease smoothly to 80 mA.  When the load resistance is increased 
to 10 Ω the high water content state is no longer stable.  After increasing the resistance to 
10 Ω the current will initially decrease to 68 mA, but eventually the fuel cell to drop to 52 
mA where it will be in the low water content steady state.  Increasing the load resistance 
further will cause the current to drop smoothly.  If the load resistance is decreased from 
10 Ω to 8 Ω the cell current will increase from 52 mA to 60 mA.  The fuel cell will 
continue to operate on the low water content branch until the resistance is reduced to 6 Ω. 
When the resistance is decreased to 6 Ω the current will initially increase to 75 mA and 
eventually it will jump to 100 mA to its stable steady state.  The data shown in Figures 10 
and 11 correspond to the dynamics of these jumps. 

 

26 

  

 
We wish to stress the importance of distinguishing between true and “pseudo” steady 
states during testing of PEM fuel cells.  The dynamics of transitions between steady 
states shown in Figures 10 and 11 show that it took 103 – 104 s for a new steady state to 
be achieved after changing the external load resistance.  PEM fuel cell characterization 
by current-voltage measurements is typically done in about 102 s.  During the time period 
typically allocated for a polarization curve measurement the water produced is not 
sufficient to equilibrate the water content of the membrane.  A lower limit on the 
equilibration time for the membrane is given by the ratio of the water uptake per unit area 
of membrane divided by the water production at the cathode (this limit assumes all the 
water goes to membrane and none is lost to anode and cathode effluents).  The water 
uptake per unit area is equal to some multiple of the number of sulfonic acid residues per 
unit area or membrane.  The water production is ½ the current density.

The quantity ∆λ in equation 9 is the change in the number of water molecules per 
sulfonic acid group.  For current densities ~ 100 mA/cm2 and a change in the hydration 
state of the sulfonic acids of 1 water molecules/SO3 the characteristic time is 400 s.  
When we report polarization curves or Power Performance Curves these data are taken in 
<100 s, and represent an approximately constant hydration state of the membrane.  To 
assure steady state operation of the fuel cell it is necessary to wait for several 
characteristic time periods, or several hours.     
 
We were puzzled about the physics behind the five steady states and the dynamics of the 
transitions.  In particular, the membrane resistance as a function of water activity given 
by equation 8 suggests there are some key physics that we did not recognize.  The Power 
Performance Curves for the autohumidification PEM fuel cell operating in the high water 
content state as a function of temperature are shown in Figure 16A.  The MEA resistance 
increases with temperature.  Figure 16B shows the MEA resistance as a function of cell 
temperature for both the low water content state and the high water content state.  The 
MEA resistances for the two branches diverge above 65ºC.  Why should the five steady 
states have a start temperature, and what could be the physical cause for the phenomena?

We suggest the second ignition is due to a coupling of mechanical and chemical effects.  
The polymer membrane in the MEA is pressed between porous carbon electrodes, 
spatially confining the membrane.  The entire MEA is pressed between graphite 
electrodes pressed against the MEA, as shown in Figure 17.  As the membrane takes up 
water, the proton conductivity increases, but the membrane also swells.  However, being 
spatially confined the membrane is not free to swell unlimited, it must do work to push 
the electrodes apart, or to swell into the porous electrode.  Water uptake is hindered by 
the spatial constraints until the free energy associated with additional water uptake 
(swelling pressure) is sufficient to overcome the force to push the electrodes apart or 
penetrate into the porous electrodes.  The energy required for swelling (or shrinking) of 
the membrane depends on the elastic properties of the membrane.  Increasing temperature 
and increasing water content will both reduce the elastic modulus and glass transition 
temperature of the Nafion membrane.  Above a critical temperature the swelling pressure 
of the membrane is reduced to the point where it is not sufficient to push the electrodes 
apart.   
 
The effect of the spatially confined MEA on the water uptake is to pin the water activity 
at fixed values until the membrane swelling pressure overcomes the applied force of the 
electrodes.  By pinning the water activity the proton conductivity is also pinned.  This 
would result in a trend for the membrane resistance exactly as given in Equation 9.

plates with the flow channels are forced against the membrane electrode assembly and bolted with some

collector plates as it swells due to water uptake. 
 
 
Proton conductivity in Nafion as a function of water activity has been studied, but these 
studies have always been done in unconstrained geometries.  The pressure loading of 
PEM electrodes may play a critical role in the performance of PEM fuel cells and this 
subject will be vital to proper design and control of PEM fuel cell stacks where both 
temperature and water activity will be varying.    
 
V. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
We have demonstrated the use of a model PEM fuel cell reactor that has permitted 
detailed studies of the kinetics, and the coupling of gas transport and electrochemical 
reactions.   

(1) This reactor has permitted the unambiguous demonstration of an 

autohumidification PEM fuel cell between 30-105ºC. 

(2)  The autohumidification PEM fuel cell displays the classic ignition/extinction 

phenomena associated with multiple steady states.  A critical initial water content 
in the membrane was required for the fuel cell to ignite.  

(3) Feedback between the reaction product (water) and the transport of protons from 
the anode to the cathode was the cause of the steady state multiplicity.  This is a 
new phenomenon of coupling between a reaction product and a transport process 
leading to steady state multiplicity. 

(4) The kinetics of water production were measured in the autohumidification PEM 
fuel cell.  For <50% utilization of hydrogen and <95% utilization of oxygen the 
fuel cell current was almost independent of the reactant flow rates.  

 

29 

  

(5) Above 65ºC the autohumidification PEM fuel cell displayed five steady states, 

(three of them stable) with hysteresis between a high water content state and a low 
water content state as the load resistance was varied.  The five steady states were 
attributed to the coupling between chemical and mechanical properties of the 
polymer membrane due to swelling.

Power Performance Curve 
 
Fuel cell performance has typically been evaluated by the polarization curve where the 
voltage (V) between the electrodes is measured as a function of the current (I) through 
the external circuit.  To measure the polarization curve, the external load is varied 
resulting in a change in the current passing through the fuel cell. A typical polarization 
curve is shown in Figure A1.  The information contained in the polarization curve can be 
presented in different ways.  We have found that for characterizing and evaluating the 
performance of a PEM fuel cell the power dissipated through the external load (IV) as a 
function of the external load (RL=V/I) provides a helpful alternative presentation of the 
data.  The power performance curve is shown in Figure A2.

load resistance.  This data is for an autohumidification 
PEM fuel cell at 70 C.

Figure A1.  A typical polarization curve for a PEM fuel cell.  
At low currents the voltage drops rapidly due to the 
activation over potential at the cathode.  The region between 
50-250 mA corresponds to the ohmic region where the 
effective voltage is approximately constant at 0.84 V.  At 
the higher currents the voltage starts to decrease more 
rapidly due to mass transfer limitations. 
 
Considering an equivalent circuit of a fuel cell, shown in Figure A3, reveals the utility of 
the Power Performance Curve representation.  The fuel cell has been represented as a 
simple battery and resistance in series.  During use, the fuel cell is where the voltage is 
approximately constant, equal to the open circuit voltage less the junction potentials and 
the over potential,  V'=Voc-η.  This effective voltage is ~0.85 V, and will vary slightly 
with the MEA fabrication, choice of electrocatalysts etc. 
 
When operating the fuel cell in the ohmic region the power dissipated in the load 
resistance is given by equation A1.

The power has a maximum value when the external load resistance matches the 
membrane resistance, Pmax=(V')2/4RL when RL=Rm.  For engineering purposes one wants 
to run a fuel cell at high power density, so it is desirable to run near the maximum power.   
 
Power Performance Curves are particularly useful in characterizing the hydration level of 
the membranes in PEM fuel cells.  It is easy to identify the membrane resistance 
corresponding to maximum power, which in turn can be used to find the water activity in 
the membrane.  
 
A key feature of the PEM fuel cell employed here was its small size (area ~1 cm2); the 
membrane resistance was ~ 1 Ω, and the cell currents were ~ 200 mA.  Under these 
conditions a simple potentiometer could serve as the external resistance to record the 
power performance curve.  For larger area PEM fuel cells the currents are larger and the 
resistances are significantly smaller, so that more complex devices are required to 
manipulate the resistive load.

open circuit voltage Voc and a variable potential representing the junction potentials and the overpotential 
associated with the cathode, replaces the fuel cell.  The battery drives a current through a variable external 
load resistance RL.  The current through the load resistance (I) and the voltage across the load resistance 
(V) are measured as the load resistance is varied.

Evidence for a Universe Expanding at the Speed of Light

ABSTRACT  
Although big bang cosmology effectively models even the most puzzling observational data, it 
offers no insight into why the cosmological expansion should occur at all. In this paper it is 
suggested that a finite Universe poses particular problems at the boundary point when time begins. 
An alternative model is proposed where the expansion arises from a need to incorporate the 
boundary effects into observation in a consistent way that avoids discontinuities and singularities. 
The theory predicts that the Universe is expanding at a constant rate, the speed of light, and correctly 
matches apparent magnitude – redshift data for both supernovae and 3CR radio sources using only 
one adjustable parameter, the absolute visual magnitude. Values of –22.6 for the 3CR galaxies and  
–25.9 for the 3CR quasars give the best fit. The new model is mapped to standard cosmology and 
predicts a deceleration parameter with a time dependence of the form q(t) = 1-2t/T, where T is the 
current age of the Universe. The model of expanding space-time with expansion retarded by gravity 
is usually associated with Friedmann’s equation(s) but is considered erroneous, giving rise to 
spurious concepts such as dark energy – in this new model mass and gravity have no effect on the 
expansion. 

 
 
1. Big Bang Cosmology 
 

General relativity is a very elegant and successful theory whose predictions have been verified with 
great precision for structures of a size comparable with the solar system. It is a natural progression to 
extend the model and apply Einstein’s equations to the entire Universe to predict scale length evolution 
from mass density. The Friedmann equation is derived by this procedure and describes the dynamic 
properties of the Universe1. The equation has a physical meaning based on the notion of a substantial 
space-time in which mass is embedded. As space expands, mass is carried with it. The moving mass has 
kinetic energy that is progressively lost as the expansion works against the gravitational potential. The 
retardation effect is expected to slow down the expansion over time. 

This simple ‘big bang’ model has actually been shown to be incorrect (or incomplete) from 
observational data accumulated over the last seven years. It has been discovered that the expansion 
began to accelerate sometime between 2 and 10 billion years ago and the Universe is still in an 
acceleration phase today. The Friedmann equation must therefore be modified in an ad hoc way to give a 
scale factor function that possesses the observed properties; this is done by adding a cosmological term 
representing an unknown large-scale repulsive force or substance referred to as dark energy. The 
equation also has parameter values that suggest a substantial quantity of dark matter is present in the 
Universe. The final equation and parameter settings very successfully explains the dynamics of the 
Universe and all observations. The current status of the ‘new cosmology’, as it has been dubbed by 
Turner2
, is satisfactory and the next stage of development is expected to be the identification of dark 
energy and dark matter and to put strong constraints on their properties. 

In this paper we will look at the philosophical foundations of the Friedmann Equations and the big 
bang paradigm, and highlight issues that even today, 80 years on, are worthy of exploration. One major 
objective of a fundamental theory (loosely stated) is to offer a simpler causative explanation for the 
behaviour under investigation. It should ideally make possible an intuitive understanding of the 
underlying process. The big bang model does not achieve this, although this is by no means evidence the 
theory is incorrect – it is however suggestive of a problem. It is certainly the case that the Universe is 
expanding and had a beginning in time: we are looking to the big bang paradigm to explain why it is 
expanding at all and why it is expanding at a particular rate at a particular time.  

We can ask very specific questions. Why is the rate of expansion of the order of the speed of light? 
This is a peculiar coincidence. How did the expansion begin? If it is space that is expanding, why does 
the gravitational effect on the embedded mass reduce the expansion rate rather than lead to proper 
motion of mass with respect to the expanding space-time manifold? Space and matter must be connected 
in a rather complex fashion resulting in a metaphysical model of the Universe that is much more 
complex than before because the actual relationship between matter and space is quite unclear. We

expect reciprocal behaviour – if matter movement can affect space expansion, we would expect normal 
motion through space as a result of conventional forces to give rise to expansion or contraction. This 
appears not to happen; the necessary coupling between space–time and matter is quite mysterious and 
certainly not contained in the tenets of general relativity. Finally, why does the expansion not affect 
bound systems? The big bang model offers no answer to these questions and one is left only with the 
unsophisticated analogy of an explosion at T = 0 (which, to be fair, many cosmologists reject). While 
impressive in practice, the big bang model is philosophically unsatisfactory. 

Alternative metaphysical models that actually explain the expansion should be welcomed and must be 

considered in spite of the wide-held view that cosmology is ‘solved’3. One ‘sample’ concept will be 
introduced in this paper and we will take it through the stages of evaluating its philosophical worth to 
predictions about the behaviour of the Universe and finally comparing these predictions with 
observation. It is however only one of a class of models, all of which reject the conventional notion that 
the dynamics of the Universe is described by Friedmann’s equation. 

 
2. A Consistent Metaphysical Model 
 
  To understand the Universe, we can proceed in the manner of Descartes; determine what it is we can 

be certain of, and construct a model on that foundation. The Universe certainly exists, and though some 
may disagree, the Universe is consistent¶. One facet of this consistency is the conservation laws, 
primarily energy and momentum. In the context of consistency, the questions about the origin of the 
cosmological expansion posed in the previous section can be rephrased: Why is it necessary for the 
Universe to expand in order that consistency be maintained? Or equivalently, what inconsistency would 
arise if the expansion did not occur? 

We can try to answer this question from the viewpoint of the observer in the context of what is 
directly observable. From this perspective, the retarded frame is appropriate4. In the retarded frame, the 
observer is in the privileged position of being at the centre of a finite Universe and its oldest inhabitant. 
Light that is received has been emitted at earlier times from objects that lie on concentric spherical 
surfaces tracing the regression of time to an outer surface where T=0, the point when the Universe came 
into existence and time began.  The outer surface is the transition from no time (or Universe) to existence 
and time progression. A major discontinuity can be expected at this point. It is the case in our Universe 
that the observer always appears protected from singularities and discontinuities. We might therefore 
expect the Universe will operate in some way to prevent the T=0 discontinuity becoming apparent at an 
observational level. One way this can happen is if the outer surface recedes from the observer at the 
speed of light.  The way this works can be illustrated with an example: Consider the observer at time 
T=To. Let the observer be in causal contact with an emitter at T=0 at the edge of the Universe, a distance 
cTo away. After a time increment DT in the observer’s frame, time has moved on to To+DT. The Universe 
has also expanded by cDT hence photons received at this later time from the same source will also appear 
to have originated from time T=0. The observer can remain in causal contact with entities for whom time 
does not progress, thus the transition point as time began to ‘flow’ is incorporated into the observable 
world§.  It is suggested this may be the reason for the cosmological expansion – in the example, if there 
were no recession velocity then the observer would perceive photons received at To+DT to have 
originated from the source on the boundary at a later time, which of course is impossible if time is not 
progressing at the boundary -  there is no later time. The cosmological expansion is a direct consequence 
of the finite age of the Universe: mass density and gravitation are irrelevant. 

The model is simple and philosophically very appealing because it deals nicely with the beginning of 

time and incorporates it into observation. A prediction of the new model is that the Universe is 
expanding at a constant rate c and we may presume intermediate locations scale proportionally. The 
apparent velocity can be considered equivalent to a proper velocity with radiation subject to the 
appropriate Doppler shift. The redshift-distance function of this model is thus very different to that of 
standard cosmology and is readily tested using existing observational data.   

 

                                                 
¶ In other words, the observer is always presented with a consistent view of the world. 
§ The example is purely illustrative and it is not actually suggested that particles which have no time progression can 
actually emit photons.

3. Observational Data 
 

The apparent velocity equation is just a variation on the linear Hubble law – the distance is not the 

proper distance but the retarded distance, i.e. the photon journey time multiplied by c. The Hubble 
constant H is simply the reciprocal of the current time. A distant object will have an apparent velocity 
relative to the observer of 

where To is the current time and Te is the emission time¶. Throughout the paper, the current age of the 
Universe is taken as 13.7 Gyr. The current size of the Universe is cTo and with 71 km/s/Mpc as the 
present value of the Hubble constant, the boundary is receding at exactly the speed of light, consistent 
with the assumptions of the model. Space-time is unconditionally flat and the recession velocity is 
treated special relativistically. The redshift z is derived from the Doppler equation for an outward radial 
proper velocity v:

The model is readily tested using so-called ‘standard candles’. A large set of redshift – apparent 

magnitude measurements have been accumulated for a variety of object types around z = 1. The 
procedure is to take the measured redshift and extract the equivalent velocity using equation (2). The 
apparent distance (in parsecs) is then found by taking the difference between the apparent and absolute 
magnitudes, m – M, and using the magnitude-distance formula: 

 
To get the photon travel distance dt, the apparent distance is divided by (1+z) (to correct for photon 

energy loss and the number reduction), 

 
The points (v, dt) are then plotted. From equation (1) the points should fall a straight line that cuts 

through (0,0) and has a gradient of 1/To. There are two classes of cosmological objects that are 
considered standard candles and are suitable for this test. Type Ia supernovae were shown in an earlier 
paper5 to satisfy equation (1). The paper also gives details about the derivation of equations (1) to (4).  
In this paper we will consider the radio galaxy ‘standard candle’. All the sources except the single 

BLac from the 1985 update of the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue (3CR)6 were processed as 
described above. The catalogue entries are categorised into quasars, galaxies and N galaxies. The model 
has only one adjustable parameter for fitting, the absolute magnitude. An absolute visual magnitude of   
–22.6 was applied for the radio galaxies and –25.9 for the quasars. The points are plotted in Figure 1 on 
which the line described by equation (1) is superimposed. 

The first point to make is that the radio sources, even the quasars, appear to make reasonable standard 

candles. The data fit with this new cosmological model is very much better than more complex attempts 
with several free variables using standard cosmology7, and is clear evidence to support the validity of 
equation (1) and the new model. 

 
4. Conflict with Standard Cosmology 
 
Big bang cosmology presumes the size (as represented by scale factor a(t)) of the Universe develops 

according to general relativity with the redshift being a consequence of space expansion1. Specifically 

                                                 
¶ The implication might seem to be that there exists an absolute time which the emitter and absorber reference to ‘get’ 
the correct velocity. In fact all the equation is expressing the retarded distance between the emitter and absorber.

The new model gives the correct relationship between velocity and the size of the Universe and we 

can actually map the solution to standard cosmology and predict the form of a(t) will have to take to 
match observation. Using equation (2) for (1+z) and with t in place of Te, equation (1) becomes 

 
v is actually specified by equation (1) and with this substitution the explicit expression for a(t) in 

standard cosmology will be

In the standard model, the expansion will seem to decelerate until time t = To/2 (about 6.85 billion 

years ago) when it begins to mysteriously turn and accelerate. Of course, no such thing is really 
happening –it is an artefact of the equations. The Universe is actually expanding at a steady rate c 
independent of mass density or gravitation. a(t) is not a meaningful parameter and it does not represent 
the size of the Universe. 

 
The situation actually messier – the basic Friedmann equations will never admit a solution for a(t) of 
the correct form to match cosmological data (i.e. equation (7)), therefore additional terms must be added 
to force the desired solution. Because the original terms are attributed a physical meaning (kinetic 
energy, gravitational energy etc), the added terms are also given physical meaning. This then is the origin 
of dark matter and dark energy; merely artefacts of an incorrect philosophical description of the 
expansion of the Universe. 

 
5. Conclusion 
 
The cosmological expansion thus arises in this new model because time and the Universe had a 

beginning. Expansion enables the discontinuity at the start point to be correctly managed. The 
explanation is philosophically superior to the rather crude analogy to an explosion adopted by the big 
bang model. The new model is in excellent agreement with observation giving a good fit for both 
supernova and radio galaxy data. The idiosyncrasies of standard cosmology (accelerated expansion and

dark energy) are correctly identified and quantified. It is implicit that the Universe is a causally 
connected whole and that there are no disconnected parts. Inflation is therefore discounted and in fact 
unnecessary as the Universe is unconditionally flat.  

The model does however give rise to a range of new questions. One of these involves energy 

conservation, which is the cornerstone of the philosophy of the new model. Although gravitation has no 
effect on the expansion, energy must still be conserved as space expands. It has been shown in another 
paper in this series8 that, although a constant expansion rate conserves momentum, gravitational energy 
is not conserved. One may speculate that the gravitational constant increases with the cosmological 
expansion. This would certainly result in energy conservation but there is strong evidence the 
gravitational constant does not vary. However the available data is with respect to the solar system which 
is not subject to the cosmological expansion; we would not expect a variation in the gravitational 
constant in this domain.  

Another important issue is time. Equation (1) would appear to suggest that there exists a universal 
absolute time but that is not the case. For each observer, all measurements are relative to their timeline 
not a universal time. Whilst the model is not compatible with general relativity, it is compatible with 
special relativity.

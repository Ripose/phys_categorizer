Summary 

The purpose of this paper is to investigate experimental and numerical dynamic responses 

of  a  preloaded  vibro-impacting  Hertzian  contact  under  sinusoidal  excitation.  Dynamic 

response  under  random  excitation  is  analysed  in  the  second  part  of  this  paper.  A  test  rig  is 

built  corresponding  to  a  double  sphere-plane  contact  preloaded  by  the  weight  of  a  moving 

cylinder.  Typical  response  curves  are  obtained  for  several  input  levels.  Time  traces  and 

spectral  contents  are  explored.  Both  amplitude  and  phase  of  harmonics  of  the  dynamic 

response are investigated.  

Linearised  resonance  frequency  and  damping  ratio  are  identified  from  the  almost  linear 

behaviour  under  very  small  input  amplitude.  Increasing  the  external  input  amplitude,  the 

softening  behaviour  induced  by  Hertzian  nonlinear  stiffness  is  clearly  demonstrated. 

Resonance peak is confined in a narrow frequency range. Jump discontinuities are identified 

for both amplitude and phase responses. Forced response spectrum exhibits several harmonics 

because  of  nonlinear  Hertzian  restoring  force.  Numerical  simulations  show  a  very  good 

agreement with experimental results. 

For  higher  input  amplitude,  system  exhibits  vibro-impacts.  Loss  of  contact  non-linearity 

clearly  dominates  the  dynamic  behaviour  of  the  vibroimpacting  contact  and  leads  to  a  wide 

frequency  range  softening  resonance.  Spectral  content  of  the  response  is  dominated  by  both 

the first and the second harmonics. Evolution of the experimental downward jump frequency 

versus  input  amplitude  allows  the  identification  of  the  nonlinear  damping  law  during 

intermittent contact. Simulations of the vibroimpacting Hertzian contact are performed using 

a shooting method and show a very good agreement with experimental results. 

 

1. Introduction 

Many mechanisms and mechanical devices use Hertzian contacts to transform motions and 

forces  and  to  ensure  rotation  or  translation  motions.  Under  operating  conditions,  these 

contacts  are  often  excited  by  dynamic  normal  forces  superimposed  on  a  mean  static  load. 

These excitation forces can be generated externally to the contact. They can also be generated 

by internal sources as roughness induced vibrations. Undesirable vibration responses can lead 

to  excessive  wear,  contact  fatigue  and  noise  generation.  Furthermore,  in  many  mechanisms 

and  mechanical  devices  such  as  gears  and  rolling  element  bearings,  clearances  introduced 

through manufacturing tolerances are necessary to ensure good functioning. Under excessive 

excitations, contacts can exhibit undesirable vibroimpact response leading to surface damage 

and excessive noise. In this context, study of the dynamic behaviour of fundamental Hertzian 

contacts  including  possible  loss  of  contact  is  an  essential  stage  in  the  understanding  of  the 

dynamics of more complex mechanical systems. 

Considering  vibrations  of  Hertzian  contact  excited  by  sinusoidal  force,  numerous  papers 

present  theoretical  studies  concerning  the  primary  resonance  which  occurs  without  loss  of 

contact  [1,  2,  3].  Nayak  modeled  a  preloaded  Hertzian  contact  problem  using  the  harmonic 

balance method [1]. The primary resonance exhibits a nonlinear softening behaviour induced 

by the nonlinear contact stiffness. Nevertheless, bending of the resonance peak remains in a 

narrow frequency range. Other theoretical works related to the primary resonance of Hertzian 

contact include that of Hess and Soom [2]. They analysed the reduction of the average friction 

coefficient induced by the dynamic response, using the multiple scales method. Perret-Liaudet 

and  Sabot  analysed the primary resonance including vibroimpact responses using a shooting 

method in relation with a continuation method [3]. The effect of the contact loss non-linearity 

is strong as the softening resonance is established in a much wider frequency range. Finally, 

theoretical description of the 2-subharmonic resonance and of the 2-superharmonic resonance 

is achieved by Perret-Liaudet [4, 5]. 

 

Partial experimental results concerning the primary resonance are presented by Carson and 

Johnson [6]. They used an original test rig consisting of two rolling contact discs, one of them 

being regularly corrugated. Sabot et al. [7] experimentally studied a ball normally preloaded 

by a moving rigid mass. They clearly exhibited the softening primary resonance when no loss 

of contact occurs and analysed mechanical sources of damping. 

In  this  paper,  experimental  dynamic  behaviour  of  a  preloaded  double  sphere-plane 

Hertzian  contact  under  sinusoidal  excitation  is  investigated.  Dynamic  responses  are 

investigated  in  detail  including  vibroimpact  responses.  Comparison  with  theoretical  results 

permits us to conclude on the main characteristics of the system associated to both Hertzian 

non-linearity and contact loss non-linearity. After description of the studied dynamic model in 

section 2,  we  present  the  used  test  rig  and  the  experimental  procedure  in  section 3. 

Experimental and theoretical results are presented in section 4.

2.1 Equation of motion 

The  single-degree-of-freedom  impact  oscillator  under  study  is  shown  in  Figure 1.  A 

moving rigid mass m is kept in contact with a flat surface and loaded by a static normal load 

FS. Assuming Hertzian contact law, the nonlinear restoring contact force can be derived from 

material properties and contact geometry [8]. When the system is excited by a purely normal 

zero-mean force F(t) superimposed on the static load, the equation of motion may be written

times in equation (1) but other laws are introduced later.

One can  introduce  a linear damping force (n = 0), or a damping force proportional to the 

contact radius (n = 1/2), or a damping force proportional to the elastic deformation and to the 

contact  area  (n = 1),  or  a  damping  force  proportional  to  the  elastic  restoring  force  (n = 3/2). 

For  these  laws,  it  should  be  noted  that  damping  acts  only  when  contact.  More  complex 

damping contact laws have been introduced in preceding studies [9, 10, 11] but have not been 

investigated in this study. 

3- Test rig and experimental procedure 

3.1 Test rig 

Test rig is displayed in Figure 2. The experimental studied system corresponds to a double 

sphere-plane Hertzian contact. A 100C6 steel ball is compressed between the horizontal plane 

surfaces  of  two  100C6  steel  thick  discs  which  are  rigidly  fixed  to  a  heavy  rigid  frame  of  a 

machine tool and a cylinder moving like a rigid body. 

Ball diameter is 25.4 mm and its weight is 70 g. Double sphere plane Hertzian contact is 

loaded by the weight of the moving cylinder. Its mass is m=11.4 kg, corresponding to a static 

load Fs=mg=110 N. The moving cylinder is held by six titanium thin stems connected to the 

rigid frame in order to prevent lateral displacements and rotations. Then, only vertical motion 

of  the  cylinder  is  authorised.  Furthermore,  stems  also  allow  regulation  of  the  cylinder 

verticality. 

Compliance  of  a  rough  and  weakly  loaded  sphere-plane  contact  obtained  experimentally 

may be different from the theoretical compliance supplied by the Hertz equation [12]. Planes 

were ground to obtain roughness Ra<0,4 µm in order to avoid this problem. Ball roughness is 

also  weak  (Ra<0.03 µm),  so  that,  asperities  are  quite  smaller  than  contact  deflection  and 

contact area. Finally, only dry contact is considered. Surfaces are cleaned before each run to 

remove grease from contact. 

 

The experimental system can be modelled by a two degrees of freedom nonlinear dynamic 

system. However, the ball mass is negligible with regard to that of the moving cylinder, and it 

can  easily  shown  that,  for  sufficiently  low  frequencies,  this  model  is  equivalent  to  the 

previously  defined  single  degree  of  freedom  system  (1)  [7].  Constant  k  of  the  preceding 

restoring elastic  force  expression is deduced from the double sphere-plane Hertzian contact. 

Assuming identical mechanical properties for the ball and the discs leads to: 

where  E  is  the  Young  modulus  (210 Gpa),  ν  is  the  Poisson's  ratio  (0.29)  and  R  is  the  ball 

radius (12.7 mm).

(p0=1.2 GPa) to ensure an elastic contact. 

3.2 Instrumentation and acquisition 

Contact  is  normally  excited  by  a  vibration  exciter  connected  to  the  moving  cylinder  and 

suspended  with  four  springs.  Sinusoidal  input  is  applied  to  the  moving  cylinder  and 

superimposed on the static load Fs. For this end, a signal generator and a power amplifier are 

used.  

 

 

 

 

 

A piezoelectric force transducer is mounted between the vibration exciter and the moving 

cylinder  to  measure  the  excitation  force  F(t).  The  vertical  response 

  of  the  cylinder  is 

)t(z&&

measured  by  a  piezoelectric  accelerometer.  Normal  force  N(t)  and  tangential  forces  T(t) 

transmitted  to  the  frame  through  the  contact  are  measured  by  a  piezoelectric  tri-axis  force 

transducer. Classical charge amplifiers are used for all responses. 

Regulation  of  the  cylinder  verticality  leads  to  a  quasi-perfectly  normal  load.  During 

experimental  measures,  we  check  that  tangential  forces  are  negligible  and  remain  always 

lower  than  1 %  of  the  normal  force  transmitted  to  the  frame.  Considering  the  experimental 

system  and  the  transducer  stiffness  (8000 N/µm),  the  force  measurement  bandwidth  is  0-

7 kHz. 

The  input  force  and  the  dynamic  responses  are  displayed  on  a  four-channel  storage 

oscilloscope. Spectral contents (amplitude and phase) are measured with a real time spectrum 

analyser  using  a  sampling  rate  of  4096  samples  over  the  frequency  bandwidth.  Then  the 

frequency resolution is never unless than 0.25 Hz for all spectral quantities. Each harmonic of 

signal is analysed using a lock-in amplifier. This one is based on a phase sensitive detection to 

single out the components of the signal (frequency, amplitude, and phase). 

4- Forced dynamic response to a sinusoidal excitation 

All the experimental data obtained show a near perfect similarity between the fluctuating 

part  of  the  normal  force  and  the  vertical  acceleration  of  the  moving  cylinder.  Measured 

correlation coefficients are always up to 99 %. Then, for convenience, only results associated 

to the normal force are presented. 

4.1 Dynamics without contact loss 

When  external  input  amplitude  is  very  small  (σ =0.03 %),  contact  dynamic  behaviour  is 

almost  linear,  even  if  the  resonance  curve  is  slightly  asymmetrical  (see  Figure 3).  No  jump 

phenomenon  occurs  and  harmonic  normal  force  is  observed.  Linearised  contact  frequency 

 

measured  from  these  experimental  data  (f0=233.4 Hz)  is  close  to  the  predicted  natural 

frequency  since  the  relative  error  is  less  than  0.5 %  (see  equation  (15)).  Analysis  of  the 

amplitude response curve of H1 allows to estimate an equivalent viscous damping ratio close 

to ζ=0.5 %. This result is coherent with preceding studies [7]. 

For higher external input amplitudes, experimental normal force N(t) presents not only H1 

component  associated  to  the  input  frequency  ϖ  but  also  H2  component  associated  to  the 

second harmonic 2ϖ. The others harmonic components remain always negligible. Amplitude 

and  phase  of  the  two  first  harmonics  (H1  and  H2)  are  displayed  in  Figures 4  and  5,  for  two 

external  input  amplitudes.  They  are  obtained  increasing  or  decreasing  the  external  input 

frequency, such as stationary process can be assumed at each frequency. 

For  an  external  input  amplitude  σ =0.6 %,  the  system  exhibits  a  nonlinear  softening 

behaviour since the amplitude frequency response curve is bent to frequencies lower than the 

linearised  contact  natural  frequency.  Distortion  of  the  phase  response  curve  is  also  clearly 

demonstrated. The bending of the resonance curve leads to multi-valued amplitude and phase 

responses for ϖ < 1. Two stable solutions and one unstable solution exist leading to a pair of 

saddle  node  bifurcations  and  hence,  to  jump  discontinuities.  Jump  discontinuities  occur  for 

both harmonic components H1 and H2. The downward jump frequency ϖd corresponds to the 

phase resonance. Decreasing the external frequency, the phase angle of H1 component relative 

to the excitation varies from 180° to 0° with a jump discontinuity from 90° to 0°. Phase angle 

of H2 component is twice the phase angle of H1 component. During data acquisition, tracking 

of  these  phase  angles  allows  the  prediction  of  the  downward  jump  discontinuity  before  it 

Normal  response  is  very  high  for  relatively  small  input  amplitude,  so  that  external  input 

amplitude  σ =1 %  leads  to  dynamic  response  just  below  loss  of  contact.  Frequencies  of 

upward jump and downward jump discontinuities have decreased. They are close to ϖu=0.984 

occurs. 

 

and  ϖd=0.957.  The  downward  jump  frequency  agrees  very  well  with  the  theoretical  value 

predicted considering the backbone curve (ϖd=0.953) [1]. As we can see in Figures 3 and 4, 

H2  component  amplitude  becomes  non-negligible  and  reaches  17 %  of  H1  component 

amplitude in the resonance peak. This behaviour results from the asymmetrical characteristic 

of the nonlinear restoring Hertzian force around the static equilibrium. 

Minimum  and  maximum  peak  amplitudes  of  the  normal  force  are  displayed  in  Figure 6. 

Time  history  of  the  normal  force  at  the  resonance  peak  is  displayed  in  Figure 7.  It  shows 

hardening behaviour in compression (Νmax = Fs + 1.3 Fs) and softening behaviour in extension 

(Νmin = Fs - 0.92 Fs).  Spectrum  of  the  normal  force  is  displayed  in  Figure 8.  H1  component 

appears up to 1 although loss of contact does not occur. Consequently, resonance peak cannot 

be  accurately  predicted  from  analytical  methods  only  taking  into  account  the  fundamental 

harmonic  such  as  the  harmonic  balance  method  and  the  multiple  scales  method  [1,  2].  H2 

component is close to 0.2 and the higher components are negligible. 

Finally, the softening behaviour, well known through numerical results [1, 2, 3], is clearly 

demonstrated  experimentally.  Nonlinear  behaviour  associated  to  Hertzian  contact  is  rather 

weak since the resonance curve is confined in a narrow frequency range close to the linearised 

4.2 Dynamics with intermittent contact loss 

For  this  set  of  experimental  results,  it  is  important  to  say  that  good  repeatability  was 

Experimental results show that a small input amplitude is likely to induce intermittent loss 

of contact. When σ >1.2 %, loss of contact occurs as the normal force reaches 100 % of the 

static load, that is to say the vertical acceleration of the moving cylinder reaches the gravity 

acceleration.  Vibro-impact  response  leads  to  contact  fatigue  and  undesirable  noise  (until 

80 dB 1 meter far from the test rig). Figures 9 and 10 display the frequency response curves

always observed. 

 

for  increasing  input  amplitudes  up  to  1.2 %  of  the  static  load.  Loss  of  contact  non-linearity 

clearly  dominates  the  dynamic  behaviour.  It  strongly  bends  the  frequency  response  curve  to 

low frequency (softening behaviour). For instance, in the case of an input amplitude close to 

7 %  of  the  static  load,  upward  jump  frequency  is  equal  to  ϖu=0.909  and  peak  resonance 

occurs  at  ϖd=0.560  (nearly  half  the  linearised  contact  frequency),  so  that,  dynamic  vibro-

impact  response  can  be  established  over  a  wide  frequency  range.  Furthermore,  the  spectral 

content of the response is now much richer. H2 component amplitude reaches up to 80 % of 

H1  component  amplitude  in  the  peak  resonance.  We  can  also  observe  irregularities  on  the 

frequency response curve just before the downward jump occurs. These ones certainly result 

from  the  excitation  of  the  second  mode,  inducing  a  ball  motion  between  the  upper  and  the 

lower planes. 

Figure 11  displays  the  experimental  downward  jump  frequency  ϖd  versus  the  input 

amplitude  σ.  We  can  observe  three  behaviours. Just  below the linearised  contact  frequency, 

(0.957< ϖd <1) no loss of contact occurs and the downward jump frequency decreases slowly. 

When vibroimpacts occur, the downward jump frequency suddenly decreases over a relatively 

large  frequency  range  and  then  slowly  decreases  (0.675< ϖd <0.957).  Then,  the  downward 

jump frequency suddenly decreases again (ϖd<0.675). 

Figure 12  displays  the  normal  force  time  histories  for  various  input  amplitudes.  Input 

frequency  is  close  to  the  downward  jump  frequency.  Responses  are  asymmetrical  and 

momentary loss of contact can be clearly observed. Then, for σ =1.4 % (and ϖ =0.9), loss of 

contact occurs during 40 % of the overall time, for σ =3 % (ϖ =0.76), loss of contact occurs 

during 60 % of the overall time, and for σ =7 % (ϖ =0.55), loss of contact occurs during 75 % 

of  the  overall  time.  For  the  last  case,  cylinder  fly  period  reaches  5.8 ms.  Furthermore, 

instantaneous transmitted normal force reaches 600 % of the static load for the presented time 

histories. However, plastic deformation has not been observed on surfaces. 

 

Finally, we can observe that the last time history of the normal force exhibits the influence 

of the second mode characterised by the ball motion between the upper and the lower planes. 

4.3 Theoretical results 

We  have  used  a  classical  numerical  time  integration  explicit  scheme  (central  difference) 

for  achieving  dynamic  time  histories  of  theoretical  responses.  A  specific computing method 

devoted  to  nonlinear  problems  is  used  to  obtain  the  primary  resonance,  that  is  to  say  a 

shooting method with continuation technique (see for example [13, 14]). 

In the case of an external input amplitude just below loss of contact, theoretical prediction 

of the primary resonance is displayed in Figure 13 and compared to experimental results. As 

we  can  see,  theoretical  results  are  in  very  good  agreement  with  experimental  ones  for  both 

amplitude and phase response curves. The narrow frequency band of the softening resonance 

is  confirmed.  Damping  ratio  introduced  in  the  numerical  model  (0.45%)  is  close  to  the  one 

experimentally  measured  at  very  low  excitation  (see  section 4.1).  By  introducing  different 

damping  laws  (see  equation (11) ),  we  have  numerically  observed  that  they  don't  affect  the 

primary resonance curves. This result is coherent with preceding study [7]. 

Figure 14  displays  the  primary  resonance  exhibiting  the  strong  nonlinear  behaviour 

induced by loss of contact. The wide frequency range softening resonance observed is in good 

agreement  with  experimental  results.  However,  the  introduced  damping  ratio  is  higher  than 

the one experimentally measured at very low excitation. In the contrary of the preceding case, 

the damping contact law strongly influences the downward jump frequency prediction.  

Downward  jump  frequencies  ϖd  versus  input  amplitude  σ  (see  equation (11) )  are 

displayed  in  Figure 15  for  different  damping  laws.  Results  are  compared  with  experimental 

ones  displayed  in  Figure 11.  On  the  contrary  to  third  experimental  behaviour  observed  for 

ϖd<0.675,  the  two  first  experimental  behaviours  can  be  explained  by  theoretical  results.  As 

expected,  for  a  constant  input  amplitude,  downward  jump  frequency  associated  to  damping 

 

proportional  to  elastic  restoring  force  is  higher  than  the  one  associated  to  linear  damping 

during contact. A linear damping law during contact is not suitable in contrast with nonlinear 

model. Even if the predicted and the experimental behaviours are similar, predicted softening 

resonance peaks are wider than experimental ones, for all the introduced damping laws during 

contact. Several explanations may be done as follows: 

- Other sources of damping may exist becoming more and more significant with the amplitude 

-  Other  kinds  of  damping  law  during  contact  may  be  more  adapted  to  treat  the  theoretical 

response. 

model. 

- Some interactions between the first and the second modes may affect the dynamic behaviour 

of the system resulting in occurrence of other bifurcations. 

Anyway  it  appears  necessary  to  carry  on  efforts  of  research  in  order  to  obtain  precise 

knowledge  of  damping  mechanisms  during  impacts.  Actually,  in  our  opinion,  damping  in 

vibroimpact conditions is not adequately modelled at the present time. 

Finally, time traces  of  the steady  state normal force response are given in Figures 16 and 

17 illustrating respectively a case without loss of contact and a case with. Theoretical results 

are in a good agreement with experimental ones (see Figures 7 and 12) despite adjustment of 

damping ratio in vibroimpact conditions. In particular, when impacts occur, flight time ratio is 

correctly  predicted,  compared  to  in  contact  time  and  maximum  amplitude.  Nevertheless, 

increasing the damping ratio is necessary to adjust levels, even if a damping proportional to 

elastic restoring force is introduced. 

5- Conclusion 

An original test rig has been built and improved in order to analyse vibrations of a double 

sphere-plane preloaded Hertzian dry contact excited by a purely harmonic input normal force. 

Theoretical and experimental results concern the primary resonance. Experimental linearised 

 

contact frequency and theoretical value are very close (233 Hz). Damping ratio measured with 

small input amplitude is very low (0.5 %). 

For  input  amplitude  lower  than  1 %  of  the  static  load,  no  loss  of  contact  occurs. 

Experimental  dynamics  clearly  demonstrates  the  softening  behaviour  of  Hertzian  contacts 

well known through numerical results.  

The  resonance  curve  is  bent  to  frequencies  lower  than  the  linearised  contact  natural 

frequency,  leading  to  saddle-node  bifurcations  and  jump  discontinuities.  We  have  observed 

that  the  dynamic  response  is  dominated  by  both  the  H1  component  associated  to  the  input 

fundamental frequency ϖ and the H2 component associated to the second harmonic 2ϖ. Jump 

discontinuities  happening  for  both  components  H1  and  H2  and  the  associated  phases  are 

clearly shown. But we can conclude that the Hertzian non-linearity remains rather weak since 

the  resonance  peak  is  confined  in  a  narrow  frequency  range  close  to  the  linearised  contact 

frequency. This result is confirmed by theoretical analysis. 

As  the  damping  is  low,  a  small  input  amplitude  is  likely  to  induce vibroimpacts  (around 

1.2%  of  the  mean  static  load).  Loss  of  contact  nonlinearity  clearly  dominates  the  dynamic 

behaviour  as  it  strongly  bends  the  frequency  response  curve  to  low  frequencies  (softening 

behaviour). Actually,  resonance peak is established over a wide frequency range. Amplitude 

of the H2 component becomes higher and higher and cylinder fly duration becomes longer and 

longer as input amplitude increases. 

Specific computing methods devoted to nonlinear problems, i.e. shooting and continuation 

methods, have been used to treat the loss of contact non-linearity and to investigate theoretical 

dynamic  response  of  the  Hertzian  contact.  Theoretical  results  qualitatively  agree  very  well 

with  experimental  ones.  Quantitatively,  slight  discrepancies  appear.  Particularly,  it  is 

necessary  to  increase  the  theoretical  damping  ratio  with  the  amplitude  response  even  if  a 

viscous damping proportional to the restoring elastic force is introduced. This result reveal a 

lack  of  comprehension  of  damping  physical  sources.  So,  in  our  opinion,  some  efforts  of 

 

research  are  necessary  to  obtain  precise  knowledge  of  damping  mechanisms  in  vibroimpact 

conditions.

Shared almost evenly by Peru and Bolivia, Lake Titicaca is situated on an Altiplano endorheic region 
of  the  northern  Andes  Mountains.    Rio  Desaguadero  is  the  lake’s  only  outlet.    From  1908,  several 
macro-engineers speculated on the creation of a second, completely artificial, outlet for Lake Titicaca’s 
freshwater.    Here  we  reconsider  several  20th  Century  macroproject  proposals,  with  the  goal  of 
examining and enhancing this technically interesting South American 21st Century Macro-engineering 
inheritance.

Abstract

1. Introduction

Lake Titicaca is, probably, a Quaternary Period remnant of the Mantaro mega-lake that filled the Basin 
to a maximum elevation of ~4,000 m (Oncken, 2006).  Nowadays, Lake Titicaca has a semi-regulated 
surface  altitude  of  ~3810  m.    Its  freshwater  volume  is  ~930  km3  (UNESCO,  2003).    During  an 
extremely dry  period  between  circa  4000  BC  to  circa 3000  BC,  Lake Titicaca  was  ~75  m  below  its 
present-day altitude;  by  circa 2500  BC  it  began  to  fill  again  and  rise  to  its  current elevation  (Baker, 
2005).    The  presently  existing  higher  elevation  of  the  lake’s  free  surface  has  submerged  ancient 
artifacts  and  settlements  (Calaway,  2005).    Indeed,  the  landscape  surrounding  the  present-day  Lake 
Titicaca  indicates  an  ancient  anthropogenic  component—terraces,  raised  fields,  sunken  gardens  and 
irrigated pastures (Morris, 2004).  

Lake Titicaca constitutes  a freshwater resource for approximately 2.5-3.0  million persons residing in 
Peru and Bolivia. However, about 95% of the freshwater removed from Lake Titicaca leaves by way of 
evaporation,  while  the  remaining  5%  is  comprised  of  a  discharge  through  the  Rio  Desaguadero 
amounting  to  ~20-35  m3/second.    During  1996,  the  two  riparian  states  organized  the  Binational 
Autonomous Authority for Lake Titicaca (ALT).  Since 2001, a dam near the International Bridge at 
the  headwater  of  the  Rio  Desaguadero  has  been  equipped  with  floodgates  to  provide  a  stable 
anthropogenic  hydraulic  capacity  for  Lake  Titicaca.    According  to  the  ALT  Master  Plan,  the  water 
level of Lake Titicaca ideally ought to be maintained at range of between 3808 and 3811 m above sea 
level.  An increase in the human population around Lake Titicaca is forecast and freshwater usage will 
inevitably increase (Revollo, 2001).  A future resource for the needed freshwater may become possible 
with the reduction of natural evaporation from the lake’s ~8,400 km2 surface.  In similar arid climates 
elsewhere  as,  for  example,  at  Lake  Eyre  in  Australia,  a  50%  reduction  of  free  water  surface 
evaporation could be achieved through deliberate spreading of an ultra-thin layer of organic molecules 
(in  powder  form)  such  as  proposed  by  Robert  Neville  O’Brien  in  USA  Patent  6303133,  issued  16 

October  2001. 
  Under  the  sunny  conditions  prevailing  at  Lake  Titicaca,  after  application 
biodegradation  will  occur  in  about  2.5  days;  it  will  be  technically  necessary,  then,  for  ~100  kg  of 
O’Brien’s powder to be broadcast three times per week, or 12 times per month—144 times per year.

Today,  Peru’s  ~28,000,000  citizens  obtain  ~80%  of  their  power  from  hydroelectric  generating 
facilities.    The  nation’s  total  operational  base-load  is  nearly  6000  MW.    (The  country’s  largest 
hydropower  installation  is  the  Mantaro  Complex  in  southern  Peru.    About  20%  of  Peru’s 
hydroelectricity  is  generated  there,  nearly  1008  MW.    The  Mantaro  Complex—built  from  1973  to 
1985—utilizes a ~1,000 m drop which occurs at the Mantaro River’s first  great bend as it flows into 
the Basin of the Amazon River.)  Peru has untapped hydropower resources on the eastern slopes of the 
Andes  Mountains while  thermal power stations  are  mostly  concentrated along the  densely  populated 
coast affected directly by the Pacific Ocean.
                      
2. Hydropower from Lake Titicaca for the Coast

While the National Map of Peru was commenced on 10 May 1921 by plane table and alidade methods, 
it remains incomplete at the start of the 21st Century (Mugnier, 2006).  Accurate topographic mapping 
is, of course, essential to the planning of any macroproject, but especially a macroproject that relies on 
freshwater’s long distance fall from the Andes Mountains to the Pacific Ocean!  

Charles Reginald Enock (1868-1970), a British explorer of Peru, was first to explore and cursorily map 
the resources of Lake Titicaca and its surrounding region (Markham, 1905).  He suggested a 120 km-
long  tunnel  could  convey  the  lake’s  liquid  contents  to  the  populated  coastal  region  adjacent  to  the 
Pacific Ocean and generate hydropower simultaneously (Enock, 1908).  A vertical drop to sea level of, 
say, 20 m3/second from an elevation of 3810 m could theoretically produce 640 MW, close to 10% of 
Peru’s  existing  installed  electricity  generation  infrastructure!      Although  we  cannot  be  certain,  we
suspect  C.R.  Enock  may  have  been  inspired  by  the  North  American  engineer  Alexis  Von  Schmidt 
(1821-1906) who, from 1865 onwards, proposed and promoted a freshwater aqueduct to the City and 
County  of  San  Francisco  drawing  from  California’s  Lake  Tahoe  (Pisani,  1974).    Whatever  is  the 
historical  truth,  the  idea  was  taken  up  again  during  the  1950s  by  the  French  engineer  Marcel  Mary 
(Mary,  1959).    Translated  into  English  and  generalized,  Mary  offers  the  opinion  that  a  diversion  of 
Lake Titicaca to the Pacific Ocean by piercing at depth would provide a large head—perhaps as much 
as 3500 m—and would supply irrigation water to Peru’s arid coast.

Trans-Andean  railways, which  depend on  vast lengths of tunnel,  are  in  a  chaotic state  at  the present 
time.  It is alleged by WIKIPEDIA that “In 2006, Ferrocarril Central Andino, work started to regauge 
the  line  from  914  mm  to  1435  mm.    There  is  also  a  proposal  for  a  21  km  tunnel  under  the  Andes” 
(WIKIPEDIA, accessed 29 January 2007).  Such a Macro-engineering proposal is made credible by the 
53 km-long English Channel Tunnel and the planning work being done by Alp-Transit Gotthard for a 
57  km-long  tunnel  between  Erstfeld  and  Bodio,  Switzerland  that,  at  its  deepest,  will  be  2  km 
underground!  The key technology that makes it possible to dig deep and long tunnels efficiently is the 
hard-rock  Tunnel-boring  Machine  (TBM),  a  machine  that  excavates  a  tunnel  by  drilling  out  the 
heading  to  full  size  in  one  operation  (Hapgood,  2004;  Maidl,  2007).    During  early  2007,  a  Robbins 
TBM  began  to  bore  Peru’s  20  km-long  Olmos  Transandino  Project.    When  finished,  the  Olmos 
Transandino Project will siphon freshwater from sources higher in the Andes Mountains to a reservoir 
created by Limon Dam.  Approximately, 2.0 billion cubic meters of freshwater will be shifted annually 
from the Rio Huancabamba, a tributary of the Amazon River, to the Olmos Valley in the Pacific Ocean 
watershed.  The water will be used to irrigate 150,000 ha of farmland and will also generate ~600 MW.  
The Robbins TBM will have to negotiate quartz porphyry and andesite geology.  If Lake Titicaca were 
drained at depth, at its deepest point, freshwater could be made to fall ~3500 m to the Pacific Ocean.

Selection of the best course of the TBM-excavated tunnel will have to be done on the basis of on-site 
macro-engineering and geological studies.  The studies will aim to predict, in the alternative suggested 
tunnel courses, the influence of the rock conditions on TBM operation, the amount of lining, the site 
and  depth  of  the  adits  to  the  tunnel  and  the  extent  of  the  definitive  field  studies  that  must  be  done 
before  commencement  of  tunnel  construction.    The  economic  benefits  from  the  studies  can  be 
estimated  as  a  considerable  percentage  of  the  total  construction  cost  of  the  tunnel  driving.    As  with 
other  modern-day  macroprojects,  Macro-engineering  has  changed  from  its  20th  Century  incarnation; 
21st  Century  Macro-engineering  leaders  of  any  project  must  have  a  list  of  groups  to  be  met  with, 
environmental impact statements to be filed, national and international laws to be complied with, and 
public concerns to be addressed.  Yet the result—a legal and financial go-ahead—if done properly, is 
well  worth  the  constraints  of  time  and  direct  financial  hardship:  hydropower  technology  chosen 
openly, democratically, and consensually, rather than being dictated.  Within a range of about 250-700 
m, both Francis and impulse turbine units can be used.

Ordinarily, Lake Titicaca hydropower potential would remain worthless (on a significant geographical 
and  economical  scale)  in  the  near-term  future  for  a  number  of  reasons:  (1)  the  absence  of 
Environmental  Impact  Statements;  (2)  formidable  geological  and  geomorphic  impediments  such  as 
infamously powerful  earthquakes and rugged, even  jagged, incidental  terrain; (3) nearly non-existent 
traffic  infrastructure  such  as  highways,  roads  and  railroads;  (4)  high  to  very  high  initial  investment 
costs  and  long-period  financial  pay-backs;  (5)  the  requirement  for  reliable  long-distance  aerial 
weather-resistant  electric  transmission  lines  over  great  distances;  (6)  the  reluctance  of  international 
money lenders to consider low-interest loans to Peru and Bolivia; (7) volatile and inconsistent national 
political  opinions  regarding  priorities  of  national,  regional  and  centralized  or  decentralized  energy 
system  development  and  (8)  the  considerable  on-going  development  of  alternative  energy  resources 
such as natural gas fields.  

Furthermore, we must assume that future global climate change may instigate flexibility requirements 
for  many  existing  and  planned  infrastructures!    If,  for  example,  the  Altiplano  climate  becomes  drier 
than today, then Lake Titicaca will be reduced in volume and the freshwater could be wasted.  On the 
other hand, if the Altiplano becomes wetter, Lake Titicaca will refill faster and pose a severe damage 
threat  to  all  established  infrastructures  surrounding  that  body  of  water  that  is  wedged  in  the  Andes 
Mountains!  Our offered technical suggestion creates a situation whereby—in either instance—Peru’s 
coast-sited population will flourish and prosper! The map of Titicaca region is shown in FIGURE 1.

Bolonkin-Cathcart Infrastructure Innovation

The  conventional  method  to  harness  hydropower  energy  obtained  from  a  high-altitude  lake  is  by 
drilling  a  difficult-to-complete  tunnel,  or  several  such  tunnels,  through  the  enveloping  hard-rock 
mountains. But in our case, in particular, this common method is excessively expensive, dangerous and 
requires long  excavation  period.  So far,  the world  practice of  tunneling  has  no  experience  with very 
long tunnels, especially those incised in hard-rock mountain geological structures.

6
At  this  time,  we  offer  an  important  technical  innovation—to  put  hermetic  steel  or  prefabricated 
reinforced  concrete  tube  line,  both  emplaced  by  heavy-lift  helicopters,  over  Andes  Mountains 
(FIGURE 2). The water pump station 2 lifts the freshwater from Lake Titicaca to the mountain ridge 
and  into  conveying  hermetic  tube.    Then  the  water  can  safely  flow  to  lower-elevation  hydroelectric 
plant  4.  The  90-95%  energy  spent  for  pumping  will  be  recuperated  because  the  lower  hydroelectric 
plant 4 will work off of a greater water level (and higher pressure). This technical innovation decreases 
our unconventional facility’s monetary installation cost by hundreds of times!

to nearby maintain top is ~20 km, the linear distance to nearest mountain river (west of ridge) that 
drains to the Pacific Ocean is ~60 km and, thence, to the Pacific Ocean is ~200 km (see map in 
FIGURE 1). In Bolivia the shortest distance from Pucarani to Rio Zongo (after ridge) is ~50 km.

 Computation is presented in FIGURE 3.

FIGURE 3. Full installation potential power of proposed Andean electricity plant via the water 

expense for different coefficients of efficiency.

As  the  reader  can  readily  notice,  the  minimal  water  expense  (20  m3/s,  without  anthropogenically 
changing Lake Titicaca’s free surface level) produces about 640 MW while the maximal expense (35 
m3/s, without any change of lake level) produces 1070 MW.  If we agree to decrease Lake Titicaca’s 
area  by  two  times  (100  m3/s,  with  alteration  of  the  lake  level,  FIGURE  8)  then  the  electricity 
generating  station  can  permanently  produce  3060  MW.  That  is  a  very  powerful  electric  plant,  just 
about equaling 50% Peru’s current electricity base-load!

The big hydraulic tube (with a large diameter) is more expensive but such a tube has the advantage of 
decreasing  greatly  the  pressure  loss  and  increases  significantly  the  efficiency  and  the  power  of  our 
proposed electric-generation station for Peru located west of the Andes Mountains.

4. Tubes.  Tubes near the lower hydropower  station  have high pressure (up  380 atm.). They must be 
made  from  steel  or  something  even  stronger—perhaps  from  some  composite  fiber  material.  Such 
composed material has higher maximum stress (up 600 kg/mm2, steel has only 120 kg/mm2) and low 
specific-density  (1800  kg/m3,  steel  has  7900  kg/m3).  It  may  be  or  become  cheaper  quite  soon. 
Coefficient  of  safety  is  3  to  5.    Below,  is  the  useful  equation  for  computation  of  the  tube  wall 
thickness.

  5. Over-expenditure of water. In case of permanent  water over-expenditure,  Lake Titicaca will be 
balanced  at  a  new,  human-selected  lower  free-surface  water  level.  The  lake’s  area  decreases  and 
evaporation also decreases. The site-specific computations for Lake Titicaca are presented in FIGURE 
8. The maximum of water extension is about 200 m3/s, producing a maximum electric power of about 
6100 MW. That is equivalent to all electric power plants of Peru at the present time! But, eventually, 
Lake Titicaca will vanish as a geographic feature.  (It is possible to imagine that future global climate 
change might eventuate in a wetter regional climate allowing the constancy of this terminal lake.) The 
other  way  is  to  decrease  evaporation  by  using  some  special  anthropogenic  floating  coverings  that 
create a thin layer on the freshwater’s free surface and, thereby, retard or even prohibit evaporation or, 
ultimately, to simply cover the water surface with an extremely pliable and thin fabric film.  

12

                   
FIGURE  8.  Decreasing  of  the  lake’s  surface  area  via  average  flow  through  the  power  plant.  If  the 
average flow is less then  30 m3/s,  we can decrease  the loss  (flow) in  the  Rio  Desaguadero and 
retain  Lake  Titicaca’s  level.  (Nowadays,  there  is  a  dam  regulating  the  Rio  Desaguadero.)  Any 
permanent use of more than 30 m3/s inevitably decreases the lake’s free surface area.

Conclusion

The  inexpensive  hydroelectric  power  plant,  having  generation  capability  of  640-1000  MW  may  be 
built near Lake Titicaca without any hazardous, ugly change to Lake Titicaca’s area or volume (water 
expense up 20-35 m3/s). For this to happen, the floodgates of the dam on the Rio Desaguadero near the 
International Bridge must be permanently closed. Average Rio Desaguadero flow is 70 m3/s and Rio 
Desaguadero will become a river of smaller total flow emptying into Lake Uru Uru, which is north of 
Lake Poopo.
  
If we choose to permanently utilize >30 m3/s then Lake Titicaca’s free surface total area will decrease 
markedly. We can, however, receive, distribute and use more or less permanently a maximum up 6100 
MW.  Lake Titicaca will vanish, but our innovative suggested hydroelectric station will still produce 
utilizable  power.  If,  sometime,  we  find  a  truly  economical  method  for  halting  or  greatly  reducing 
evaporation  of the  high-altitude  lake,  then  it  will  certainly become  possible  to  save  Lake Titicaca  in 
perpetuity  and  yet  still  harness  a  great  quantity  of  electricity!    The  electricity  will  be  fed  into  the 
dispersed main load centers by the national power grid while the freshwater can be used for irrigation 
and urban use in Peru’s desert-like coast region.

Most  likely  geopolitical  obstacle:  Bolivia  may  not  agree  to  such  freshwater  diversion  because  Lake 
Titicaca is a shared resource managed by ALT. However, Bolivia also has a known need for low-cost 
electricity  and,  therefore,  we  think/believe  that  an  amicable  international  legal  treaty  agreement  is 
possible.

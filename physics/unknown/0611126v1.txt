ABSTRACT 
 
We  consider  plasmonic  nanoantennas  immersed  in  active  host  medium.    Specifically  shaped  metal  nanoantennas  can 
exhibit  strong  magnetic  properties  in  the  optical  spectral  range  due  to  the  excitation  of  Magnetic  Plasmon  Resonance 
(MPR).  A case when a metamaterial comprising such nanoantennas can demonstrate both “left-handiness” and negative 
permeability in the optical range is considered.  We show that high losses predicted for optical “left-handed” materials 
can  be  compensated  in  the  gain  medium.    Gains  required  to  achieve  local  generation  in  such  magnetic  active 
metamaterials are calculated for real metals.  We propose plasmonic nanolaser, where the metal nanoantenna operates 
like a resonator.  The size of the proposed plasmonic laser is much smaller than the wavelength.  Therefore, it can serve 
as a very compact source of EM radiation.      
Keywords: Plasmonics, Nanomaterials, Actively Pumped Metamaterials, Negative Refraction, Nanolaser. 

1.    Introduction 

 

 

Extending  the  range  of  electromagnetic  properties  of  naturally  occurring  materials  motivates  the  development  of 
artificial  metamaterials.    For  example,  it  has  been  demonstrated  recently  that  metamaterials  may  exhibit  such  exotic 
properties  as  artificial  magnetism  [1],  negative  dielectric  permittivity  (see,  for  example  [1,2]),  negative  magnetic 
permeability  [3],  and  even  both  [4-6].   The  double-negative  case of  Re ε  < 0  and  Re µ  <  0  is often referred  as  a  left-
handed  material  (LHM).    Situations  when  a  negative  refractive  index  can  be  realized  in  practice  are  particularly 
interesting  because  of  the  possibility  of  a  “perfect”  lens  with  subwavelength  spatial  resolution  [6].    In  addition  to  the 
super  resolution  not  limited  by  classical  diffraction,  many  unusual  and  sometimes  counter-intuitive  properties  of 
negative  refraction  index  materials  (NIM)  make  them  very  promising  for  applications  in  resonators,  waveguides,  and 
other microwave and optical elements [7–10].  Negative refraction and subwavelength imaging has been demonstrated in 
the  microwave  regime  [5,8,9,11].    For  microwave  NIMs,  artificial  magnetic  elements  providing  Re µ < 0  are  the 
resonators of the split ring type.  In the microwave range of the spectrum metals can be considered perfect conductors 
because  the  skin  depth  is  much  smaller  than  the  metallic  feature  size.    The  strong  magnetic  response  is  achieved  by 
operating in the vicinity of the LC resonance of the split ring [1,3,12].  The same technique of obtaining Re µ < 0 using 
split rings was recently extended to mid-IR [12] by scaling down the dimensions of the split rings. 
 
For  the  microwave  and  mid-IR  wavelengths,  metals  can  be  treated  as  perfect  conductors.    Therefore,  the 
frequencies of the LC resonances are determined entirely by the split ring geometry and size, not by the electromagnetic 
properties of the metal.  In accordance with this statement, the ring response is resonantly enhanced at some particular 
ratio  of  the radiation wavelength  and  the  structure  size.   Thus, we  refer  to  the  LC resonances of  perfectly  conducting 
metallic structures as geometric LC (GLC) resonances.  The situation drastically changes in the optical (near-IR) part of 
the spectrum, where thin subwavelength metal components behave very differently when their sizes become less than the 
skin depth.  For example, the electrical surface plasmon resonance (SPR) occurs in the optical and near-IR parts of the 
spectrum  due  to  collective  electron  oscillations  in  metal  structures.    Many  important  plasmon-enhanced  optical 
phenomena and applications of metal nanocomposites are based on the electrical SPR (see, for example [13]). 

Plasmonic  nature  of  the  electromagnetic  response  in  metals  for  optical–mid-IR  frequencies  is  the  main  reason 
why the original methodology of GLC resonances in the microwave– mid-IR spectral range is not extendable to higher 
frequencies.    For  the  optical  range,  NIMs  with  a  negative  refractive  index  were  first  demonstrated  in  [14]  where  the 
authors observed the real part of the refractive index n1= − 0.3 at the telecommunication wavelength of 1.5 µm.  In [14] 
paper the authors experimentally verified their earlier theoretical prediction of negative refraction in an array of parallel 
metal  nanorods  [15].    The  first  experimental  observation  of  negative  n  in  the  optical  range  was  followed  by  another 
successful  experiment  [16].    Note  that  the  losses  become  progressively  important  with  decreasing  the  wavelength

towards  the  optical  range  [17].    Moreover,  finite  losses  inside  the  LHM  superlens  could  dramatically  reduce  the 
resolution of such lens [18] and made a dream of a superlens unattainable. 

Plasmonic effects must be correctly accounted for the design of metamaterials with optical magnetism.  Below we 
show that specifically arranged and shaped metal nanoparticles can support along with the electrical SPR also a magnetic 
plasmon resonance (MPR).  The MPR frequency can be made independent of the absolute characteristic structure size a.  
In  fact,  the  only  defining  parameters  of  the  MPR  are  the  metal  permittivity 
  and  the  structure’s  geometry.    Such 

ε
m

structures  act  as  optical  nanoantennas  by  concentrating  large  electric  and  magnetic  energies  on  a  nanoscale  even  at 
optical  frequencies.    The  magnetic  response  is  characterized  by  the  magnetic  polarizability  α
M  with  the  resonant 
behavior similar to the electric SPR polarizability αE: real part of αM changes the sign near the resonance and becomes 
negative, as required for negative index meta-materials. 

We  show  that  MPR  must  replace  or  strongly  modify  GLC  resonances  in  the  optical/mid-IR  range  if  a  strong 
magnetic  response  is  desired.    The  idea  of  MPR  for  inducing  optical  magnetism  is  relatively  new  [19].    Horseshoe-
shaped  structures,  first  suggested  in  [20]  are  described  below.    These  structures  support  strong  magnetic  moments  at 
frequencies higher than microwave–mid-IR range for which traditional split ring resonators (see [3,12] for details) were 
proposed  and  demonstrated.    Conceptually,  the  horseshoe-shaped  structures  described  here  are  distinct  from  the 
previously  studied  low  frequency  structures,  which  relied  on  the  GLC  resonance  for  producing  a  strong  magnetic 
response.  Horseshoe nanoantennas have distinctively different magnetic response from split ring antennas due to their 
“elongated” shape and concentration of the EM field inside the gap between the “arms” of the horseshoe. 

Plasmonic properties of the metal are very important when the sizes are small and the operational frequencies are 
high.    In  the next  section,  we  will  outline  the derivation of  the  magnetic  permeability  of  the  metamaterial  comprising 
such  horseshoe  shaped  metallic  nanoparticles.    We  are  interested  in  the  horseshoe  resonators  filled  with  an  active 
medium. 
 
2.      Electrodynamics of Horseshoe shaped Nanoparticles 
 
We  consider  the  interaction of  the  metallic  horseshoe  shaped  nanoantenna with  a  two-level  amplifying  system  (TLS), 
which can be represented by a quantum dot in the semiconductor host or another high gain medium.  In this paper, we 
will try to derive the conditions under which such a medium can demonstrate very low loss or even a gain leading to 
lasing  in  the  LHM.    Lasing  in  the  random  medium  without  cavity  was  predicted  by  V.S.  Letokhov  [21]  and  first 
demonstrated experimentally by N. Lawandy et al. [22].  Recently strong lasing was demonstrated in the dye solution 
containing  55  nm  silver  nanoparticles  [23].    Very  recently,  increased  gain  up  to  105  cm-1  was  demonstrated  in  the 
medium  comprising  quantum  dots  in  photonic  crystal  [24,  25].    Propagation  of  the  surface  plasmon-polariton  in  the 
interface  of  metal  and  gain  medium  was  considered  in  many  papers  [26-31]  Recently  the  effect  of  small  increase  in 
plasmon amplitude due to interaction with active medium was observed in the experiment [32].  The enhancement of the 
fluorescence in the dye film deposited on a corrugated silver surface was investigated in [33].  Most recently, when this 
paper was submitted for publication a new advance in improved gain of SP in active medium was achieved.  A six-fold 
gain demonstrated by Noginov at al. in [34].  The possibility of nonradiative transfer of energy from the active medium 
to  the  static  plasmon  modes  of  a  metal  nanoparticle  was  discussed  by  Bergman  and  Stockman  [35].    Increasing  the 
resolution by removal of absorption in a near-field lens via optical gain was discussed in [36].  Red shift of the excitonic 
peak  and  enhanced  local  field  in  quantum  dots  was  observed  in  [37].    The  review  of  recent  works  on  LHM  in  gain 
medium  is  presented  in  [38].    Below  we  will  consider  optical  properties  of  magnetic  nanoantennas  in  active  medium 
with high gain. 
 
For  the  sake  of  simplicity,  we  assume  that  TLS  are  placed  inside  the  horseshoe  resonator  of  a  type  shown  in 
Fig. 1.    An  external  pump  provides  the  population  inversion  in  the  TLS.    The  pump  mechanism  may  be  optical  or 
electrical,  when  carriers  are  injected  from  the  bands  of  a  semiconductor  material  surrounding  the  embedded  quantum 
dot.  In the equations, we will characterize only the pump rate and initial population inversion of the TLS interacting 
with  MPR  field.    First,  we  will  present  the  calculations  of  the  electromagnetic  fields  in  a  system  comprising  metallic 
nanoantenas with resonant frequency lying in the visible on NIR band. 

We consider a metal nanoantenna that has a shape of horseshoe as shown in Fig.1.  For the sake of simplicity of 
further calculations, we will consider the two-dimensional geometry when the transverse size of the horseshoe is much 
larger  than other  dimensions.    The  external  magnetic  field  excites  the  electric  current  in  the  arms  of  the  horseshoe  as 
shown in Fig. 1.  Magnetic moment associated with the circular current that flows in the antenna is responsible for the

magnetic  response  of  the  nanoantenna.    The  external  magnetic  field

Equations  (8)  –  (10)  describe  the  electric  and  magnetic  fields  generated  by  plasmons  excited  in  the  horseshoe  by  the 
external magnetic field H0.  We would like to emphasize that neither magnetic, nor electric fields are potential in that 
type of the nanoantenna.  It is taken for granted that the magnetic field is solenoidal field.  What is more surprising the 
electric  field  is  also  solenoidal  in  the  horseshoe  resonator  despite  the  fact  that  its  size  is  much  smaller  than  the 
zE
wavelength.  Indeed, it follows from Eq. (10) the electric field 
 

 depends on the coordinate z and electric field  

yE

depends on the coordinate y.  The solenoidal electric field is the essence of MPR. 
Since the external magnetic field excites circular electric currents in the horseshoe nanoantennas it is naturally to 
 
assume that the metamaterial comprising such nanoparticles will have effective magnetic properties.  Let us assume that 
horseshoe nanoantennas with volume density p are organized in a regular cubic lattice.  We will calculate the magnetic 
permeability  µ of such system using the approach developed by A. K. Sarychev and V. M. Shalaev in [13].  Expression 
for  µyields 
 

 is the magnetic field generated by the horseshoe current.  Substituting here 

from Eq. (6), we

Therefore, the permeability of such a system has a Lorentz shaped resonance with the central frequency defined by the 
following condition (see Fig.2): 
  

 
We are particularly interested in the case when the dielectric host medium filling the space inside the horseshoe is an 
active high gain medium.  This situation can be modeled to the first approximation, by the assumption that imaginary 
part of 

ε is negative [30, 31]. 
 
One can see from different examples in Fig. 2 that increased gain leads to the narrowing of the absorption line of 
the horseshoe and eventually the horseshoes start to behave  as a set of nanolasers.  At the threshold, the permeability 
becomes  singular.    In  a  real  system,  the  permeability  will  saturate.    The  process  of  saturation  is  disused  below  in  the 
framework of Maxwell-Bloch equations.

that  the  instability  takes  place  as  soon  as 
  while  the  first  term  in  Eq.  (17)  is  irrelevant  now.    In  the  current 
literature, most of the authors use the approach that is equivalent to consideration the first term in Eq. (17), i.e., they use 
a complex impedance (effective permittivity) to describe the medium with gain.  We see that obtained thus results have 
limited meaning since the corresponding solution of the Maxwell equations could be unstable. 
    The  electric  current  and  the  field  in  the  antenna  cannot  increase  up  to  infinity  due  to  the  saturation  of  the  active 
medium.  To take into account the depletion of the active medium we write the following phenomenological equation for

predictions can be made immediately: let assume that at the initial moment there is no electric current or charge in the 
antenna, which will correspond to the initial conditions I(0)=0 and q(0)=0.  When the external magnetic field is turned 
on, the current will start to increase exponentially according to Eq. (17).  Later on the electric current as well as electric 
charge  will  saturate  at  some  level  due  to  the  depletion  of  the  active  medium.    In  general,  the  saturation  level  will  be 
proportional to the amplitude of the magnetic field in the impingent electromagnetic wave.  In our model it is denoted as 
the amplitude 

 of the electromotive force (EMF) in the equivalent LCR circuit depicted in Fig. 3.

4.  Interaction of Nanoantennas with the active host medium and plasmonic laser 
 
In  order  to  understand  the  origin  of  the  lasing  in  active  plasmonic  medium  we  will  consider  a  microscopic  model 
following  the  consideration  of  a  dipole  laser  presented  by  Protsenko  et  al.  [39].    We  use  the  quantum-mechanical 
derivation  of  the  equations  of  motion  for  the  system  shown  in  Fig.  1,  but  will  neglect  quantum  correlations  and 
fluctuations in our analysis.  The Hamiltonian of the nanoparticle interacting with a TLS is given by the expression:

difference  between  usual  ferromagnetism  and  proposed  optical  magnetism.    The  static  ferromagnetism  is  due  to  the 
quantum mechanical, persistent currents and it exists on its own.  The optical magnetism exist only if the active medium

5. Conclusions 
 
We  have  shown  that  horseshoe  metallic  nanoantennas  can  be  used  for  building  plasmonic  metamaterials  with  both 
negative permittivity and permeability, which can lead to LHM in NIR and optical band of the spectrum.  Contrary to the 
previously well established believe that most materials do not demonstrate any anomalous magnetic permeability at high 
optical  frequencies,  we  have shown  that  specifically  shaped nanoparticles  can  demonstrate  negative permeability  (and 
refraction) in optics by exciting MPR.  It is well known that plasmonic materials will demonstrate very high absorption 
in the optical range, which will make them an unlikely candidate for lenses and other practical optical devices.  In this 
paper,  we  have  derived  condition  under  which  such  nanoantennas  filled  with  highly  efficient  gain  medium  can 
demonstrate low absorption or even gain sufficient for lasing.  Proposed host medium should have initial gain greater 
than 103 cm-1.  There is still open question regarding the quenching and spontaneous emission of such high gain medium 
in the near field of plasmonic particles.  Set of self-consistent equations derived in this paper allows calculating those 
effects as well.  These results will be presented elsewhere.  We would like to express our appreciation to M.A. Noginov 
for  critical  reading  of  this  manuscript  and  bringing  to  our  attention  preprint  of  the  paper  [34],  in  which  a  six-fold 
enhancement in surface plasmonic resonance in the mixture silver aggregates and pumped R6G dye was observed.

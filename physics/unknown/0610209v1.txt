 INTRODUCTION 

 
Percutaneous access to kidney is a 
challenging  technique  that  meets  with 
the  difficulty 
to  reach  rapidly  and 
accurately  an  intra-renal  target.  Today, 
puncture  guidance  is  performed  under 
fluoroscopic  or  echographic  imaging, 
each  of  which  presents  drawbacks: 
2D 
provides 
fluoroscopy 
information  on 
localization,  whereas 
echography  mostly  gives  fuzzy  images 
of the target and the puncture trajectory

 PRE-OPERATIVE PLANNING 

1. CT Images Acquisition 

Modern  CT  scanners  can  provide 
high-quality  images.  We  acquired  two 
exams  of  a  healthy  volunteer,  the  voxel 
size  being  submillimetric  (0.6x0.6x0.6).

to reach). See fig. 1.

2. CT Images Segmentation 

The  CT  images  were  segmented 
using  derivatives  methods  (Nabla’s  3D 
watershed,  Generic  Vision),  which  we 
found  far  more  accurate  anatomically 
operators 
than 
provided  by  Analyze 
(BIR,  Mayo 
Clinic).

Relying on the kidney contours in 
both  CT  exams,  the  segmented  PCC  in 
exam2  were  then  registered  to  exam1 
with  an  accuracy  of  1mm 
(using 
Analyze 
registration). 
Therefore,  both  external  and  internal 
kidney  structures  were  available  in  a 
unique  CT  coordinate  system,  for  a 
more accurate planning (fig. 2).

3. Pre-Operative Planning 

The  planning  phase  allows  the 
selection  of  2  points,  a  target  and  a 
the  needle 
source,  which  define 
trajectory. The selection is performed on 
2D  ortho  and  oblique slices, and on the 
3D scene, for improved usability. 

 INTRA-OPERATIVE REGISTRATION 

1. Echographic Images Acquisition 

The acquisition was carried out on 
a  Hitachi-EUB405,  the  probe  (3.5MHz

structures) 

 
for 
being 
localized  in  space  thanks  to  a  “rigid 
body”  mounted  on,  and  to  the  Polaris 
system  (NDI)  [1,7].  The  estimated  time 
elapsed  between  the  recordings  of  the 

rigid transformation and of the image is 
70ms, which induces an error of 0.7mm 
at a 10mm/s motion.

acquisition  was  more  appropriate  to  get

done through posterior access. 

and 

The  acquired  kidney  remains  in 
place, since the subject holds his breath, 
as  long  as  the  acquisition  does  not  last 
more  than  30-40  seconds  (under  global 
anaesthesia, the control of the breathing 
should be easier, thanks to the breathing 
device and to the lack of stress). 

We  generally  acquire  200  images 
at  3  images/s,  in  both  transversal  and 
longitudinal orientations. All images are 
not segmentable, in fact.

Tab. 1 shows the results obtained 
for  6  initial  positions.  A  transform  is 
represented as one translation vector and 
three  rotation  angles.  The  deviations 
between  the  final  position  and  the  6 

initial  attitudes  go  up  to  30  mm  in 
translation  and  20°  in  rotation.  Beyond 
those  values,  local  minima  are  quasi-
systematically  found.  One  can  see  that 
the results are fairly good.

3. Guidance: Puncture of a Phantom 

Let  CT1  and  CT2  be  two  CT 
meshes, where CT2 is a transformed CT1 
(e.g.  50mm  in  translation  and  10°  on 
each  rotation  angle).  Let  US  be  a  US 
cloud of points of the same organ. M12, 
M1U  and  M2U  are  the  mono-  or  multi-
modal  transforms  betweens  the  exams 
(fig. 5). 

This is the final accuracy test. Six 
trajectories  were  planned  on 
the 
abdominal  phantom,  3  for  each  kidney. 
Fig.  6  shows  one  of  those,  and  the 
puncture needle.

that  the  needles  were,  on  the  right

1. Accuracy Issues

of

•  As  said  above,  there  is  a  small 
time gap between the probe localization 
and the image acquisition, resulting in a 
1mm error at slow speed. 

•  The  echographic  segmentation, 
even manual, is not easy, as the interface

On the left side, a local minimum 
in  the  registration  is  responsible  for  a 
needle-to-target  error  of  1cm,  although 
the  surgeon  was  very  efficient 
in 
following  the  trajectory  on  the  2D/3D 
interface.  Those  kidneys  were  half-
kidneys;  we  expect  that,  dealing  with 
entire  kidneys,  the  registration  will  be 
more reliable.

But  the  major  difficulty,  to  date, 
lies  in  the  softness  of  the  puncture 
needles. The system is reliable provided 
the  calibrated  tool  remains  rigid,  thus 
inexperienced  users  might  encounter 
finals errors over 10mm. Whereas pelvis

In  this  paper,  the  bases  of  a

presented.  The  aim  was  to  evaluate  the 
feasibility  and  the  accuracy  errors  at 
each  step  of  the  process.  In  our  study, 
pre-operative  CT  data  were  registered 
with

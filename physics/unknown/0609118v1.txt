measured  from  the  origin  O  of  the  inertial  reference  frame  K(XOY),  along  its  OX  axis 
with zero initial velocity. Equipped with clocks and light sources they are engaged with 
each  other  in  Radar  echo,  Doppler  Effect  and  Radar  detection  experiments.  They  are

also  engaged  in  the  same  experiments  with  an  inertial  observer 
K(XOY) and located at its origin O. We derive formulas that account for the experiments 
mentioned above. We study also the landing conditions of the accelerating observers on a 
uniformly moving platform. 
 
1. Introduction 
 
 
A ticking clock displays a given time that represents its reading. Identical 
clocks located at the different points of an inertial reference frame, synchronised 
in  accordance  with  a  synchronization  procedure  proposed  by  Einstein1  display

the same running time. Consider the clock 
 
of  the  OX  axis  of  the  K(XOY)  inertial  reference  frame  and  an  event  that  takes 
place in front of it when it reads t1. We say that an event E1(x1,0,t1) took place, 
characterized  by  its  space  coordinates  (x1,0)  and  by  a  time  coordinate  t1.  An 
event E1(x1,0,t2) takes place in front of the same clock when it reads t2. We say 
that  the  two  events  are  separated  by  a  time  interval  ∆ t=t2-t1,  but  take  place  at 
the same point in space. An important part is played by the clock C0(0,0) located 
at the origin O of K.  
 
Special  relativity  becomes  involved  when  we  consider  a  second  inertial 
reference frame K'(X'O'Y'). The axes of the two frames are parallel to each other, 
the OX(O'X') axes are overlapped and K' moves relative to K with constant speed 
V in the positive direction of the OX(O'X') axes. Along the O'X' axis we find the 
clocks  C'(x',0)  synchronized  in  accordance  with  the  same  synchronization 
procedure as in K, such that all of them display the same running time t’. When 
the  origins  O  and  O'  of  K  and  K',  respectively,  are  located  at  the  same  point  in 
space, all the clocks involved read t=t'=0. The notation E' (x',0,t') stands for an 
event  that  takes  place  at  the  point  M'(x',0)  when  clock  C'(x',0)  located  there

The  scenario  we  follow  requires  that  at  a  given  point  of  the  overlapped 
axes OX(O'X') we find a clock C(x,0) of the K frame reading t and a clock C'(x',0) 
of the K' frame reading t'. A fundamental problem in special relativity theory is to 
find  a  relationship  between  x  and  x'  and  between  t  and  t'.  This  problem  is 
associated  with  the  following  relativistic  effects:  radar  echo,  time  dilation  and 
Doppler Effect.2 
 

2. The radar echo 

 
 
2.1 The radar echo with uniform moving targets 
 
The  radar  echo  experiment  2  involves  a  single  clock  of  a  single  inertial 
 
reference frame, say K. The simple experiment we propose involves a source of 
light  S  located  at  the  origin  O  of  frame  K  and  in  a  state  of  rest  relative  to  it.  A 
mirror M moves with constant velocity V along the OX axis. It is located in front of 
the source at a time t=0. A light signal emitted at a time te arrives at the location 
of the moving mirror at a time tm being instantly reflected back by the mirror and 
returning  to  the  source  at  a  time  tr.  The  events  involved  in  the  experiment  are 
displayed by the classical space-time diagram4 presented in Figure 1 in the case 
of an approaching mirror Ma and respectively of a receding mirror Mr.

The world lines of the light signals emitted by the source WLe make an angle of 
450 with the positive direction of the time axis. The world lines of the light signals 
reflected  on  the  mirror  WLr  make  an  angle  of  -450  with  the  positive  direction  of 
the  time  axis.  The  world  line  of  the  receding  mirror  WLMr  makes  an  angle  α  
(tan
, whereas the world line of the approaching mirror WLMa makes an 
angle - α  with the positive direction of the time axis. We calculate the reception 
time  as  function  of  emission  time  in  the  case  of  the  receding  mirror.  Simple 
geometry applied to Figure 1 leads to :

Consider now that the light source S emits periodic signals having the constant 
period  Te  =  ∆te.  These  signals  will  be  reflected  on  the  mirror  at  periodic  time 
intervals Tm = ∆tm and arrive back at source at periodic time intervals Tr = ∆tr.

We illustrate in Figure2 the well known variation of reception period as function 
of  mirror speed  V  and  its moving  direction  relative  to  the  source.  The reception 
period may be obtained by differentiating the equations (3) and (4). For a mirror

The experiment described above involves a single observer R0(0,0) and his wrist 
watch  C0(0,0).  As  we  can  see,  the  formulas  that  describe  the  radar  echo 
experiment  are  time  independent,  due  to  the  fact  that  the  velocity  of  the  mirror 
relative to the observer is constant.  
 
 
The  problem  is  to  find  what  happens  when  the  mirror  performs  the  so  called 
hyperbolic (constant proper acceleration) motion7 which best mimics the scenario

Figure 3. The radar echo experiment with accelerating mirrors. 
Approaching mirror - left, receding mirror - right. 

 
 
Figure 3 shows the world line of the mirror WLM and the world lines of the 
successive  light  signals  emitted  by  the  stationary  source  and  reflected  by  the 
moving mirror. The mirror comes decelerating from x=+ ∞  where it is located at 
t=t'=- ∞   and  where  its  velocity  was  –c,  and  it  arrives  with  zero  velocity  at  the 
point x0=c2/g at a time t=t'=0. The mirror then accelerates towards x=+ ∞ , where 
it arrives at a time t=t'= ∞  with speed +c. As we can see, the light signals emitted 
in  the  time  interval 
  are  reflected  by  an  approaching  mirror, 
whereas the light signals emitted in the time interval –c/g < te < 0 are reflected by 
an receding mirror. Only the light signals emitted at negative times te ≤ 0 get the 
chance  to  reach  the  mirror  and  generate  a  reception  event  at  always  positive 
reception times tr  ≥ 0. 
 
In a first approach to solve the problem we use the Cochran3 hypothesis, 
 
which  is  valid  when  the  time  interval  between  the  receptions  of  two  successive 
light  signals  is  small  enough  such  that  during  their  reception  the  speed  of  the 
observer  remains  approximately  constant.  Under  such  conditions  and  because

the incidence and the reflection of the light signal take place at the same point in 
space and at a given time, we obtain the relationship between the emission and 
reception  times  and  respectively  periods  by  replacing  in  (3)  and  (3a)  the 
instantaneous  value  of  V  given  by  (6).  By  this  way  these  expression  became 
time  dependent  and  we  can  express  their  time  dependence  as  a  function  of  t', 
which  is  the  time  displayed  by  the  clock  commoving  with  the  mirror  when  the 
reflection  takes  place  on  it,  or  as  a  function  of  the  time  t,  which  is  the  time 
displayed  by  the  clocks  of  the  rest  frame  of  the  source  when  the  same  event 
takes place. In the first case we replace the right side of V expression (6) in (3a)

In  a  second  but  more  accurate  and  general  valid  approach  we  use  the 
equation of movement (5) to calculate the time tm when the light signal reaches 
the mirror. Starting with the expressions for the position xm where the reflection 
takes place on mirror: 

we get the expression for the reflection time tm as:

 we get the expression of tr  as: 

As we can see from Figure 3, the last signal that participates in the radar echo 
experiment is emitted at a time te=0. Equation (11) reveals the important fact that 
the product of emission and reception times te·tr is time independent, depending 
only on the constant proper acceleration g of the mirror. 
 
If the source S emits periodic light signals having the constant period Te then the 
signals reflected on the mirror will arrive back at source at periodic time intervals 
Tr.  By  differentiating  (11)  we  obtain  the  relation  between  the  emission  and 
reception periods as:

3. The Doppler Effect 

Equation (11a) reveals the interesting fact that the reception period continuously 
increases (red shift) from Tr = 0 at te = –∞ occurring with an approaching source 
up  to  Tr  =  ∞  for  te  =  0  with  a  receding  source  when  the  radar  echo  vanishes. 
Furthermore  we  distinguish  the  following  relations  between  the  emission  and 
reception periods: 
•  Tr  < Te when te < -c/g and the reflection takes place on an approaching mirror 
•  Tr = Te when te = -c/g and the reflection takes place on a stationary mirror  
•  Tr  > Te when te > -c/g and the reflection takes place on a receding mirror. 
 
 
 
 
 
non-locality in the reception of periodic light signals4,5,6 
 
Consider a source of light S(0,0) located at the origin O of its rest frame K 
and the clocks C(x,0) located at the different points of the OX axis, synchronized 
with clock C0(0,0) in accordance with Einstein’s clock synchronization procedure. 
When all of the clocks mentioned above read te, source S(0,0) emits a light signal 
in the positive direction of the OX axis which arrives at the location of the clock 
C(x,0) when all the clocks read tr; therefore, it is obvious that 
 
 
 
We  allow  a  very  small  change  in  the  readings  of  the  clocks  involved,  which 
reveals that they are related by

instantaneous velocity of R' does not change significantly between the reception 
of two successive light signals and the observer receives two successive light 
signals  from  the  same  point  in  space.  Relativists  describe  these  particular 
circumstances  by  saying  that  locality  takes  place  in  the  time  interval 
measurement 4,5. If the observer is moving with constant velocity then (17) holds 
in the case of finite emission and reception periods of successive light signals i.e.

observer.  We  discover  in  this  case  the  time  independence  of  the  Doppler  shift 
relation. 
 
 
 
3.2. The Doppler Effect with accelerating observers 
 
 
But what happens if the motion of the clock attached to the observer is not 
uniform? Cochran6 considers that the time interval between the receptions of two 
successive  light  signals  is  small  enough  to  consider  that  during  their  reception 
the  speed  of  the  observer  remains  constant,  such  that  the  two  successive  light 
signals  are  received  from  the  same  point  in  space.  Under  such  conditions 
Cochran6  simply  replaces  V  in  (23)  with  its  instantaneous  value  (6).  We  obtain 
the  corresponding  results  by  observing  that  Te  and  Tr  in  the  radar  echo 
experiment and Te and Tr' in the Doppler effect are related by

where equation (24) holds only in the case of the locality assumption, when we 
consider  that  two  successive  light  signals  are  received  by  the  moving  observer 
from the same point in space (locality assumption) a condition that is favoured by 
“very small periods” and “low velocities”.

In  a  more  realistic  and  accurate  approach,  we  parameterise  the 
experiment  by  considering  that  the  source  emits  at  regular  time  intervals  NTe 
(N<0). The position of the observer when he receives the Nth emitted light signal 
is defined by

Some  of  the  properties  of  the  uniformly  accelerating  reference  frame  are 
presented  by  Hamilton7  and  by  Desloge  and  Philpott8.  An  important  property  of 
this reference frame consists of the fact that the distance between two observers 
is time independent. The observer who starts his trip from the point  x=0 moves 
with infinite acceleration.

1R′  performs the experiment. 

 
The following events are involved here:  

•  Ee(xe,te) (cid:198) Observer 

1R′  emits a light signal at position xe and time te 

(proper time t'e1) towards observer 

2R′ ;  

•  Em(xm,tm) (cid:198) Observer 

2R′  receives the light signal at position xm and 
time  tm  (proper  time  t'm2)  and  reflects  it  back  without  delay  towards 
observer 

1R′ ;  

•  Er(xr,tr) (cid:198) Observer 

1R′  receives the reflected light signal at position 
xr  and  time  tr    (proper  time  t'r1)  and  calculates  the  radar  detected 
coordinates of 

2R′ .

because  g1>g2  we  have  a  time  compression  effect  i.e.  the  “radar  clock”  of  the

slower moving observer 
 
Comparing  equations  (39)  and  (46)  we  reveal  a  new  important  property  of  the 
uniformly  accelerating  reference  frame,  namely  that  distances  measured  using 
the  radar  detection  method  are  different  depending  on  which  observer  actually 
performs the radar detection. Dividing these equations we get the result:

Because  g1>g2  we  notice  a  “distance  compression“  effect  i.e.  the  faster  moving 
observer detects shorter distances by radar detection. 
 
From equations (41) and (47), which gives the relation between the proper time 
of the same event (the light reflection) for the two accelerating receivers, we get 
a common form for time transformation as:

frame 
We  devote  this  chapter  to  the  problem  of  the  smooth  landing  of  the 
 
  who  make  up  the  uniformly  accelerated  reference  frame. 
observers 
Consider an endless platform that moves with constant velocity V0 in the positive 
direction of the OX axis of the K inertial reference frame. The origin of the inertial 
reference  frame  coincides  with  the  centre  of  the  platform.  The  observer 
mentioned above reaches the velocity V0 at a time ti and at that very time he can 
land  smoothly  on  the  platform  defined  above.  Doing  so  the  reference  frame 
K'(X'O'Y') attached to the platform becomes his rest frame. It is obvious that the 
different  observers  will  land  on  the  platform  at  different  points  and  at  different 
iC′   of  the  different  observers 
times.  Once  landed  on  the  platform,  the  clocks 
become inertial ones displaying time in the way in which such clocks do.  
 
observer reaches the magnitude V0. From

The Lorentz-Einstein transformations for the space-time coordinates of the same 
event  detected  by  observers  from  K  and  K'  respectively  enable  us  to  find  out  a

Equations  (49)  and  (50)  reveal  an  interesting  property  of  the  uniformly 
accelerating  reference  frame:  In  all  inertial  reference  frames  in  which  we 
transport smoothly  the observers that make up the uniformly accelerating 
reference  frame,  the  distance  between  them  remains  constant  and  the 
clocks remain synchronized.

6. Conclusions 
Extending the results obtained by Hamilton7 and Desloge and Philpott8 we 
 
present some new results concerning the radar echo, Doppler Effect and Radar 
detection in the uniformly accelerating reference frame. The landing conditions of 
the observers who make up the reference frame are also studied.

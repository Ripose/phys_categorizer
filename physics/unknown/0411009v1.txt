The  concept  of  “basic  chemical  models”  is  introduced,  which  is  new  from  the 

standpoint of the physics of nonideal atomic plasma. This concept is based on the 

requirement  of  full  conformity  of  the  expression  for  free  energy  in  the  chemical 

model  of  plasma  to  exact  asymptotic  expansions obtained  in  the  grand  canonical 

ensemble within the physical model of plasma. The thermodynamic functions and 

equations of state and ionization equilibrium are obtained for three basic chemical 

models differing from one another by the choice of the atomic partition function. 

Comparison is made with the experimental results for nonideal plasma of cesium 

and inert gases. It is demonstrated that the best fit to experiment is shown by the 

results obtained using a basic chemical model with atomic partition function in the 

nearest neighbor approximation with classical determination of the size of excited 

atom.  

INTRODUCTION 

We  will  treat  an  atomic  hydrogen-like  plasma  consisting  of 

eN electrons, 

iN ions,  and 

aN atoms  and  located  in  a  volume  V at  a  temperature  T . The 

thermodynamic  properties  of  such  plasma  may  be  described  within  both 

“chemical”  (free  electrons,  ions,  and  atoms)  [1]  and  “physical”  (electrons  and 

nuclei)  [2-4] models of  plasma.  Assuming  that  the gas of  atoms  is ideal  and  that 

the free charges weakly interact with one another the free energy  F of the system 

being treated will have the following form within the “chemical model”:

a(cid:4) , - is the internal atomic partition

f(cid:1) - is the correction to the free 

energy  of  an  ideal-gas  mixture  in  temperature  units  per  particle,  caused  by  the 

interaction  of  free  electrons  and  ions  with  one  another.  Equation  (1)  describes  a 

system  of  charges  in  a  fairly  wide  range  of  pressures  and  temperatures  from  an 

ideal gas of atoms to fully ionized weakly nonideal plasma.  

The  arbitrary  choice  of  the  quantities 

a(cid:4) and 

f(cid:1) leads  to  numerous 

versions  of  “chemical  model”  of  plasma  (1),  while the  “physical”  model  [2-4]  is 

free  of  this  indeterminacy.  It  follows  from  the  literature  that  the  problem  of 

consistent  description  of  the  thermodynamic  properties  of  nonideal  plasma  using 

physical and chemical models has existed in the physics of nonideal plasma until 

very recently [5].  

Without  placing  restrictions  on  the  generality  of  further  computations,  we 

will assume that the dimensionless correction 

f(cid:1) is a function of only the plasma 

parameter

Relation (2) is derived as follows. Expression (1) for free energy is used to 

the  grand  thermodynamic  potential

make a transition to the grand canonical ensemble and to derive the expression for 
CM(cid:15) , which  corresponds  to  chemical  model 
(1).  We  equate  this  expression  to  exact  asymptotic  expansion  for  the  grand 

thermodynamic potential

PM(cid:15)

CM(cid:15) =
change in  relation  (4)  from  activities  to  concentrations,  which  in  fact  implies the 

(4) 

inverse transition to the small canonical ensemble, and calculate relation (2) which 

is written in the final form within terms of the order of 

2(cid:11) .

We  suggest  that  the  chemical  models  constructed  using  relation  (2)  should 

be referred to as “basic chemical models”. Their distinguishing feature is the exact 

conformity  of  expression  (1)  for  free  energy  to  the  results  obtained  using  the 

“physical  model”  for  the  grand  thermodynamic  potential  [2-4].  As  a  result,  it 

turned  out  possible  to  formulate,  for  the  first  time,  the  theoretical  procedure  for 

matching  the  calculation  of  the  thermodynamic  properties  of  weakly  nonideal 

plasma within the physical and chemical models. It turns out that almost none of 

tens  of  chemical  models  employed  in  the  literature  is  basic  within  our  definition 

(2).  

We used the Planck–Larkin approximation (PLA) and the nearest neighbor 

approximation (NNA) for the calculation of the atomic partition function to derive 

relations  for  all  thermodynamic  functions  and  equations  of  state  and  ionization 

equilibrium. Comparison was made with the experimental results of [5] for cesium,

argon, and xenon plasma.

The  concentrations  of  electrons,  ions,  and  atoms  are  related  by  the  Saha 

formula with the decrease in the ionization potential 

I(cid:1) :

Resultant  relations  (7–15)  fully  define  the  thermodynamics  and  the 

equations  of  state  and  ionization  equilibrium  of  nonideal  atomic  plasma  within 

calculations, we must determine two quantities 

chemical model (1). It follows from Eqs. (10–15) that, in order to perform concrete 
a(cid:4) . As is observed in [1], 
it is this double indeterminacy that eventually gives rise to tens of chemical models 

f(cid:1) and 

of nonideal atomic plasma [6].  

5

Relation  (2)  markedly  reduces  this  indeterminacy,  because  the  quantities 

f(cid:1) and 

a(cid:4) turn  out  to  be  related  to  each  other.  In  the  case  of  basic  chemical 

models, it is sufficient to select the atomic partition function, after which we can 

use Eq. (2) to obtain the correction to free energy and Eqs. (10–15) to obtain the 

remaining parameters.  

2.  Basic  chemical  models  of  nonideal  atomic  plasma.  When  basic 

chemical models are used, two quantities are of fundamental importance, which are 

generally not treated in the traditional theory of nonideal plasma, namely:  
a (cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:4)=(cid:1)(cid:4)
and

.

All thermodynamic corrections and the decrease in the ionization potential, 

which are given by Eqs. (2) and (10–15), are expressed in terms of these quantities. 

We will use two models for the atomic partition function in order to calculate these 

quantities.  These  models  include,  first  of  all,  the  Planck–Larkin  approximation 

which  is  most  frequently  employed  in  the  physics  of  nonideal  plasma,  because 

expression  (3)  arises  during  the  calculation  of  the  converging  part  of  the  second 

group coefficient within the physical model and, therefore, this coefficient is often 

assigned  the  meaning  of the  atomic  partition  function.  The  second  model  for the 

atomic  partition  function  involves  the  use  of  the  nearest  neighbor  approximation 

(NNA)  to  calculate  effective  populations.  It  is  very  popular  with  authors  of 

astrophysical  papers  [7];  in  our  opinion,  preference  must  be  given  to  this  latter 

model [1]. Within this model, we have, for the atomic partition function:

Here, 

k(cid:18) is  the  Poisson  probability  of  the  absence  of  charged  particles  in  the 

sphere  corresponding  to  the  size  of  atom  in  the  state  with  the  main  quantum 

number k ,

For further computations, we will examine two options for determining the 

size of atom, namely, quantum and classical ones, to which the values of H = 1 and 

H = 2 correspond,  respectively.  All  relations  for  corrections  to  thermodynamic 

functions will be derived for an arbitrary value of H.

We will construct a basic chemical model with the atomic partition function 

in the Planck–Larkin approximation given by Eq. (3),  
a (cid:4)=(cid:4)

PL

.

In this case, 

0=(cid:1)(cid:4)

in accordance with Eq. (16), and 

(20) 

because 

PL(cid:4)

0=(cid:1) (cid:4)
3(cid:11)=(cid:1)f

does not depend on density. It follows from formula (2) that 

, and Eqs. 

(10–15) give the following corrections to thermodynamic functions:  
6(cid:11)=(cid:1)p
2(cid:11)=(cid:1)e

(cid:11)=(cid:1)I(cid:7)

The  treated  version  of  base  chemical  model  is  classical  in  a  sense.  This 

version uses the results of the Debye theory for the charge energy in fully ionized 

plasma  [8].  It  is  this  particular  scheme  of  calculation  of  corrections  for  the 

nonideality  of  free  charges  in  a  partially  ionized  plasma  that  is  suggested  in  the 

majority  of  monographs  on  plasma  physics;  in  so  doing,  the  question  of  the 

partition  function  as  a  rule  remains  open.  According  to  our  approach,  it  is  the 

Planck–Larkin  partition  function  that  must  be  employed.  The  use  of  the  set  of 

corrections  (21–24)  along  with  some  other  partition  function  is  illegitimate, 

because the results obtained using the physical and chemical models will not agree, 

and  the  thus  obtained  chemical  model  will  not  be  basic.  We  will  now  examine 

another  option  of  basic  chemical  model  using  the  NNA  for  the  calculation  of 

partition function.

In order to find  (cid:1)(cid:4) , we will use the technique described in [1] and based on

In  calculating

that  its  inclusion  will  lead  to  terms  of  the  order  of

The  dependence  of  corrections  (31–34)  on  the  parameter  (cid:19) makes  it 

possible to trace the part played by excited states in the thermodynamics of basic 

chemical  models.  The  NNA  exponentially  reduces  the  contribution  made  to  the 

atomic partition function by the excited states whose volume exceeds the volume 

of the Wigner-Seitz cell. By reducing the parameter (cid:19), we cause an increase in the 

number  of  excited  states  which  make  a  contribution  to  the  atomic  partition 

function.  In  so  doing,  as  is  seen  from  relations  (31–34),  all  corrections  decrease 

and, for some value of (cid:19), even change sign. Because the main contribution to  (cid:1)(cid:4)

is that by highly excited states, the value of (cid:19) = 2 appears to be most reasonable; 

(30) 

(31) 

(32)

this  corresponds  to  the  choice  of  atomic  volume  equal  to  the  volume  of  the 

maximal  classically  accessible  region  of  motion  of  bound  electron  [9].  Another 

important  corollary  of  relations  (31–34)  is  the  significant  difference  of  obtained 

corrections for the nonideality of free charges of atomic plasma from the results of 

the classical Debye theory (21–24).  

Figures 1–4 give the obtained corrections and the decrease of the ionization 

potential  for  three  basic  chemical  models  treated  by  us  as  functions  of  the 
parameter (cid:11) . Note an important fact that the basic chemical model with the atomic 

partition function in the NNA exhibits a much smaller contribution by the effects 

of  free  charge  interaction  to  the  thermodynamics  of  partially  ionized  plasma 

compared to the basic chemical model with the Planck–Larkin partition function. 

The physical reasons for this effect have been discussed in [1]. This result provides 

a theoretical  explanation  for  the  experimentally  observed  “ideal”  behavior  of 

nonideal  plasma.  The  energy  of  Coulomb  interaction  of  free  charge  in  partially 

ionized plasma turns out to be significantly lower than the temperature (see Fig. 3), 

although the formally calculated value of the nonideality parameter is high. Figure

Figure  6  gives  comparison  of  experimental  data  (shaded  region)  and  calculated 

curves for three basic chemical models with different partition functions, namely, 

those  in the  NNA and  in the  PLA. One can  see that the  maximal  deviation  from 

experiment is exhibited by the results of calculation by the basic chemical model 

with the partition function in the PLA and with Debye corrections for free charge 

10

interaction.  By  the  way, this inference was  made  previously  [5].  Agreement with 

experiment  is  improved  significantly  when  the  NNA  with 

is  used.  Note 

2=(cid:19)

that it is very difficult to attain even a slight shift of the calculated curve toward the 

experimental region in the case of selected coordinates. 

A large  body  of  experimental  data  have  been  obtained  by  now  in  shock-

wave  experiments  performed  in  plasma  of  cesium  and  inert  gases,  where  four 

thermodynamic  parameters  could  be  measured,  namely,  enthalpy  H, pressure  P,

volume  V, and  temperature  T. In  comparing  various  theories  with  experiment,  a 

certain  inconsistency  was  observed  when  using  the  thermal  (P,  V,  T) and  caloric 

(for example P, V, H) equations of state [5]. Reaching agreement between theory 

and experiment within some model when using the thermal equation of state leads 

to  difference  between  theory  and  experiment  when  using  the  caloric  equation  of 

state  derived  within  the  same  model.  It  was  only  the  approximation  of  ideal-gas 

mixture of electrons, ions, and atoms that produced reasonable agreement between 

experiment and the results of calculations by the thermal and caloric equations of 

state.  One  can  say  that  it  was  this  inference  that  turned  out  to  be  the  most 

unexpected  result  of  experiments  in  [5]  performed  for  plasma  with  significant 

Coulomb  nonideality.  The  results  (26–29)  obtained  by  us  for  a  basic  chemical 

model with the partition function in the NNA provide a theoretical explanation for 

this inference. The consistent inclusion of the contribution by highly excited bound 

states,  defined by  (cid:1)(cid:4) according to  Eq.  (16),  results  in  a  marked  decrease  in the 

magnitude of corrections for free charge interaction (2). In addition, one must take 

into  account  the  density  derivatives  of  the  atomic  partition  function  according  to 

Eq. (17), as was emphasized in [10]. This problem was discussed in more detail in 

[11].  The  term 

(cid:4)(cid:1) , though  small,  causes  a  marked  reduction  of  the  effects  of 

Coulomb nonideality (10, 13, 15).  

Ten  sets  of  P,  V,  H,  T  experimental  data  for  cesium  and  five  sets  each  for 

argon  and  xenon  were  selected  for  comparison  with  experiment.  These  data  are 

given  in  the  monograph  [5].  All  calculations  were  performed  by  the  standard 

scheme:  two  measured  quantities  are  used  to  determine  the  third  one  for  which 

11

experimental data are also available. The calculations were performed within two 

basic  chemical  models,  namely,  those  using  the  Planck–Larkin  partition  function 

and the NNA with 

2=(cid:19) .

Given in Figs. 7–10 are the results of comparison of theory and experiment 

for cesium (Figs. 7a–10a), argon (Figs. 7b–10b), and xenon (Figs. 7c–10c) plasma 

in the form of dependence of the ratio of quantities calculated within some or other 

model  on  the  parameter  (cid:11) . In  Fig.  7,  the  temperature  is  obtained  by  measured 

values of enthalpy  H and pressure  P . In Figs. 8 and 9, the volume is calculated 

by  H , P and 

TP,

, respectively. In Fig. 10, the enthalpy is the calculated value, 

and the temperature and pressure are the initial values. Therefore, both the thermal 

and caloric equations of state are used. The use of the basic chemical model with 

the Planck–Larkin partition function and Debye corrections, especially in the case 

of  argon  and  xenon  plasma,  demonstrates  poor  agreement  with  experiment.  For 

some  experimental  points  in  the  case  of  argon  plasma  (one  point)  and  xenon 

plasma  (four  points),  the  calculation  within  this  option  of  basic  chemical  model 

cannot be performed at all, because these points fall into the region of instability of 

the model. This instability is associated with the change of sign of the derivative 

n (cid:12)
n
(cid:12)
a

e

, which gives grounds for predicting the existence of phase transition in 

plasma.  In  Figs.  7–10,  the  vertical  dotted  arrows  indicate  the  transition  to  the 

instability  region.  The  basic chemical  model  in  the  NNA  enables  one  to  perform 

calculations  for  the  entire  array  of  experimental  points.  Figures  7–10  give  the 
2=(cid:19) , which  was  selected 
from  comparison  of  theory  with  the  experimentally  obtained  isochore  of  cesium 

calculation  results  only  for  the  option  of  NNA  with 

plasma for

. During transition from one basic chemical model to 

another,  the  plasma  composition  changes,  because  the  calculation  of  this 

composition  involves  the  use  of  different  partition  functions  and  different 

expressions  for  reduction  of  the  ionization  potential  (24)  and  (34).  The  basic 

chemical  model  with  the  Planck–Larkin  partition  function  gives  higher  values  of 

the  free  electron  concentration  compared  to  the  basic  chemical  model  with  the 

12

partition function in the NNA. This fact results in different values of the parameter 

of  Coulomb  nonideality  (cid:11) for  one  and  the  same  set  of  initial  thermodynamic 

parameters. One can see in Figs. 7–10 that the calculated points corresponding to 

the  partition  function  in  the  NNA  lie  to  the  left  of  the  points  obtained  using  the 

Planck–Larkin partition function, because these former points have lower values of 

the  parameter  (cid:11) corresponding  to  them.  The  basic  chemical  model  with  the 

partition  function  in  the  NNA  is  adequately  consistent  with  experiment  in  the 

entire experimental range, especially for the case of cesium plasma. A systematic 

difference  between  theory  and  experiment  for  xenon  plasma  observed  in  some 

options  (Figs.  8c–10c)  is  possibly  associated  with  the  effect  of  interatomic 

interaction.  

 

CONCLUSIONS 

A new  concept  of  basic  chemical  models  of  nonideal  atomic  plasma  has 

been introduced. Basic chemical models provide for consistency of the theoretical 

results between the chemical and physical models. Two options of basic chemical 

model  have  been  examined,  those using  the partition  function  in  the  PLA  and in 

the NNA. A consistent use of the NNA to determine the atomic partition function 

makes  it  possible  to  explain  the  experimentally  observed  effect  of  significant 

overestimation  of 

the  contribution  made  by  Coulomb 

interaction 

to  the 

thermodynamic functions of partially ionized plasma, as given by the Debye theory 

developed for fully ionized plasma. Comparison has been made of the theoretical 

and  experimental  results.  Within  the  basic  chemical  model  with  the  atomic 

partition function calculated in the NNA, one can reach adequate agreement with 

the experimental data using both the thermal and caloric equations of state.

Abstract 

Investigation of the specific oscillations with frequencies 15-30 kHz on the T-10 tokamak (R= 
150cm, a = 30 cm) with Heavy Ion Beam Probe (HIBP) diagnostic was conducted in regimes 
with  off-axis  ECRH  (B  =  2.33  T,  Ip=  220  kA,  rECRH=12  cm).  Previous  experiments  in  OH 
regimes  have  shown  that  “20  kHz”  modes  are  mainly  the  potential  fluctuations.  These 
oscillations are seen on the signals of HIBP, Langmuir probes and reflectometry. They should 
cause the fluctuations of the poloidal rotation, i.e. the torsional plasma oscillations with m=0, 
called as the zonal flows. The HIBP sample volume was localized at r = 24 - 29 cm. It was 
observed that both in OH and ECRH regimes, the power spectrum of potential oscillations has 
a form of solitary quasi-monochromatic peak with the contrast range of 3-5. The frequency of 
“20 kHz” mode is varied in the region of observation; it diminishes to the plasma edge from 
20  kHz  at  22-24  cm  till  13-15  kHz  at  28-29  cm.  After  ECRH  switch-on,  the  frequency 
increases,  correlating  with  growth  of  the  electron  temperature  Te,  measured  by  2-nd  ECE 
harmonic on the  nearest chord 24 cm.  Analysis  have  shown that  frequency of the  “20 kHz” 
mode  is  varied  with  local  Te:  ν20∼Te
1/2  that  is  similar  to  a  theoretical  scaling  for  Geodesic 
Acoustic  Modes  (GAM):  νGAM~cs/R~Te
1/2,  where  cs  is  a  sound  speed.  The  absolute 
frequencies are close to GAM values within a factor of unity (1.12-1.5). 
 
1. Introduction 
 
The turbulence driven poloidal flows, the zonal flows, are thought to be a mechanism affected 
the  turbulence  and  transport  in  magnetically  confined  plasmas.  One  of  manifestation  of  the 
zonal  flows  is  the  oscillations  in  plasma  radial  electric  field  and,  therefore,  in  plasma 
potential. Geodesic Acoustic Mode (GAM) is the high-frequency class of the zonal flows. 
Specific  oscillations  of  the  plasma  electric  potential  with  frequencies  near  20  kHz, 
 
called  as  “20  kHz”  mode  (15  –  30  kHz)  have  been  discovered  in  the  ТЕХТ  tokamak  by 
Heavy Ion Beam Probe (HIBP) diagnostic in 1993 [1, 2]. During 2000-2002, the DIII-D team 
observed  a  peak  on  the  spectrum  of  poloidal  rotation  rates  in  the  range  ν=13-16  kHz. They 
proposed to link  it with the GAM, which  is characterized  by the square root dependence on 
the  local  electron  temperature  Te  [3,  4].  In  both  cases  the  spectra  look  like  the  strongly 
dominated  sharp  monochromatic  peak  on  the  noisy  background.  On  the  T-10  tokamak,  the 
typical  peak  was  observed  at the  appropriate  frequencies  on  the  signals  of  HIBP,  Langmuir 
probes and reflectometry [5]. HIBP is used for measurements of the plasma electric potential 
on many magnetic fusion devices. Basic principles of HIBP diagnostic are reviewed in [6].  

Here  we  discuss  the  dynamics  of  the  specific  oscillations  of  the  potential  with 
frequencies 15-30 kHz measured by HIBP in the regimes with Ohmic and ECR heating on the 
T-10 tokamak. The main parameters of discharge are: R=150 cm, a =30 cm, B0 = 19.5-2.33 T, 
Ip=180-220 kA.  

On T-10, HIBP measurements were performed  in two main operating  modes:  former 
uses the fixed position of sample volume, when the radial dependencies obtained from shot-to 
shot;  the  latter  uses the  radial  scan,  when  the  sample  volume  moves  over the  plasma  cross-
section with repetition rate ~50 kHz, producing a series of profiles during a single shot.  
 
2. Data processing 
 
The  temporal  evolution  of  “20  kHz”  on  the  spectrum  of  HIBP  signal  is  investigated.  The 
signal of potential is obtained as the relative difference of currents onto the upper and lower 
detector plates of the HIBP analyzer:  

φ ~ δi = (iUP - iDOWN)/ (iUP + iDOWN).

The sampling time is 11 µs that corresponds to νNyquist = 46 kHz; the transmission bandwidth 
of the electronics is 50 kHz. In several measurements the sampling time was diminished to 4 
µs. For the  fixed position of the  sample  volume,  potential spectra are calculated using 1024 
time points (11 ms/spectrum). The width of Hanning window is 128 points. Totally it was 15 
Hanning  windows.  The  ultimate  spectrum  was  obtained  by  averaging  over  15  spectra  from 
each window. For the radial scans, spectra are calculated using 64 points (0.6 ms/spectrum). 
Figure  1  shows  that  the  hardware  and  plasma  load  noises  are  ±  5  ADC  (analog-digital 
converter)  counts,  while  the  amplitude  of  signal  oscillations  is  ~30  ADC  counts,  i.e. 
confidently detected.

points per period of “20 kHz” mode. On the total current the “20 kHz” mode is not seen.

In the case of four plates the oscillations of plasma potential are calculated as follows: 

 
 

∆φ = 2Uan F δi 
δi = (iLU + iRU - iLD - iRD) / Σi

where Uan is the analyzing voltage, F is the dynamic factor of energy analyzer determined by 
special calibration o, i are currents on the  left (index L), right (R), upper (U) and  lower (D) 
plates, Σi is the total current at all plates. 

Figure 3 shows that the amplitude of "20 kHz" mode is up to A20~100 V.

Data processing for the radial scan is the same as for fixed point. For the radial scans, 
spectra are calculated using 64 points (0.6 ms/spectrum), which is much less than at the fixed 
point. To improve statistics, we match the rate of scan and the width of the window. Also we 
averaged  several  (up  to  5)  spectra  obtained  during  steady  state  phases  of  discharge  (OH  or 
ECRH).

shot #36819 (B0 = 2.05 T, Ip = 270 kA) at fixed sample volume, r = 17 cm, Eb = 240 keV. The 
characteristic frequency evolves with time from 20 to 24 kHz (c). 
 
3. Measurements at the fixed sample volume 
 
The  typical  power  spectra  of  potential  oscillations  for  Ohmic  and  ECRH  phases  of  shot 
#36819 are shown in Fig. 4. Measurements in the fixed position of the sample volume, r = 17 
cm  show  that  during  ECRH,  (700  ms  <t<850  ms)  the  frequency  of  oscillations  increases. 
Together with the  main peak (~24 kHz), the satellite peak with  higher  frequency (~28 kHz) 
often appears. As a rule, it has smaller amplitude with respect to the main one, so we discuss 
only the evolution of main peak with lower frequency.

Comparison  of  "20  kHz"  mode  evolution  measured  at  r  =  25  cm  with  the  electron 
temperature  measured  by ECE at the chord 24 cm  is shown  in  Fig. 5. Here we also see the 
frequency increase during ECRH, but this increase is not so pronounced as in Fig. 4. 

Figure  6  shows  variation  of  “20  kHz”  mode  during  ECRH  switch-on  for  the  shot 
shown  in  Fig.  5.  We  see  that  the  characteristic  time  of  frequency  variation  coincides  with 
characteristic time of local electron temperature variation, ~ 7 ms.

Figure 7 shows that in the outward region 
the character of evolution is the same as in 
the  core,  but  the  absolute  value  of  the 
frequency  of  dominant  peak  is  less.  It 
evolves  from  9  kHz  in  OH  phase  to  13 
kHz  in  ECRH  phase.  Measurements  with 
more rapid sampling, νN = 117 kHz, have 
shown  that  the  “20  kHz”  peak  remains 
frequency 
dominant 
domain.

The temperature dependence during one typical shot is presented in Fig. 9. The presented data

Analysis of the experimental data has shown that the frequency of “20 kHz” mode is a 
rather weak function of electron temperature, it is close to be proportional to the square root 
of Те: ν ~ Te1/2 in the observed area. Such dependence  is an  indication of the nature of the 
sound  waves.  It  allows  us  to  interpret  these  potential  oscillations  as  the  Geodesic  Acoustic 
Mode (GAM), a high-frequency type of zonal flows [2,3]. 
For more accurate comparison with GAM frequency, we used more precise two-fluids 
expression for GAM frequency, taking into account the ion temperature:

Measurements in different phases of single shot (left) and in many shots (right). The 
dependence for Geodesic Acoustic Mode is also shown. 
 
The ion temperature was calculated by the transport code ASTRA assuming experimental Te 
profile, the doubled neoclassical diffusivity and classical electron-ion equipartition. Figure 10 
shows that the experimental frequency is close to theoretical, but higher than the latter one in 
a factor of 1.12.

As it was mentioned, the discussed “20 kHz” mode is seen mainly on the potential signal (Fig. 
11, left). In studied regimes its frequency is varied from 9 till 26 kHz, being outside the 
typical MHD frequency range. On the signal of total beam current (Fig. 11, right), which is 
proportional to density, this GAM type of oscillations practically absent, but we see 
oscillations with frequencies about 7 kHz, which are the indication of the MHD activity m=2.  
We should note that the same case was seen in TEXT [1]: MHD peak dominates in the beam 
current power spectrum, while “20” kHz peak dominates in the potential power spectrum.

Comparison of our observations with HIBP measurements of plasma potential [1] and 
electric field Er fluctuations [2] in TEXT, and BES measurements of poloidal rotation velocity 
Vpol  in  DIII-D [3], shows the  significant similarities among the data  from all  machines. The 
power  spectra  of  three  closely  linked  parameters:  ∆φ,  Er  and  Vpol  are  looking  very  similar. 
They  have  the  narrow  dominant  peak  with  a  high  contrast  to  the  noisy  background.  The 
absolute  values  of  the  frequencies  are  close  to the  GAM  ones,  being  slightly  smaller.  They 
have the square root dependence on Te. 
 
 6. Conclusions  
 
The low-frequency potential oscillations were studied in the bulk plasma of the T-10 tokamak 
by  HIBP.  The  “20  kHz”  mode  is  the  dominant  high  contrast  peak  on  the  potential  power 
density  spectrum.  This  kind  of  plasma  oscillations  is  pronounced  mainly  on  the  signal  of 
potential. In studied regimes its frequency is varied from 9 kHz till 26 kHz. On the signal of 
total  current,  this  type  of  oscillations  practically  absents.  The  “20  kHz”  mode  frequency 
depends on the local electron temperature in the sample volume, ν ~ Te1/2. Observed features 
are typical  for Geodesic  Acoustic Mode (GAM). The absolute values of the  frequencies are 
close to the GAM’s one with a factor of an order of unity.

Abstract

  About fifty years ago, scientists conducted R&D of a thermonuclear reactor that promises a true 
revolution in the energy industry and, especially, in aerospace.  Using such a reactor, aircraft could 
undertake flights of very long distance and for extended periods and that, of course, decreases a 
significant cost of aerial transportation, allowing the saving of ever-more expensive imported oil-based 
fuels.  (As of mid-2006, the USA’s DoD has a program to make aircraft fuel from domestic natural gas 
sources.)  The temperature and pressure required for any particular fuel to fuse is known as the Lawson 
criterion L. Lawson criterion relates to plasma production temperature, plasma density and time. The 
thermonuclear reaction is realised when L > 1014.  There are two main methods of nuclear fusion: 
inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and magnetic confinement fusion (MCF).  Existing thermonuclear 
reactors are very complex, expensive, large, and heavy. They cannot achieve the Lawson criterion.
  The author offers several innovations that he first suggested publicly early in 1983 for the AB multi-
reflex engine, space propulsion, getting energy from plasma, etc. (see: A. Bolonkin, Non-Rocket Space 
Launch and Flight, Elsevier, London, 2006, Chapters 12, 3A). It is the micro-thermonuclear AB-
Reactors. That is new micro-thermonuclear reactor with very small fuel pellet that uses plasma 
confinement generated by multi-reflection of laser beam or its own magnetic field. The Lawson 
criterion increases by hundreds of times. The author also suggests a new method of heating the power-
making fuel pellet by outer electric current as well as new direct method of transformation of ion 
kinetic energy into harvestable electricity.  These offered innovations dramatically decrease the size, 
weight and cost of thermonuclear reactor, installation, propulsion system and electric generator. Non-
industrial countries can produce these researches and constructions.  Currently, the author is 
researching the efficiency of these innovations for two types of the micro-thermonuclear reactors: 
multi-reflection reactor (ICF) and self-magnetic reactor (MCF).
  Key words: Micro-thermonuclear reactor, Multi-reflex AB-thermonuclear reactor, Self-magnetic AB-thermonuclear

Introduction
Brief information about thermonuclear reactors

Fusion power is useful energy generated by nuclear fusion reactions. In this kind of reaction two light 
atomic nuclei fuse together to form a heavier nucleus and release energy. The largest current 
experiment, JET, has resulted in fusion power production somewhat larger than the power put into the 
plasma, maintained for a few seconds. In June 2005, the construction of the experimental reactor 
ITER, designed to produce several times more fusion power than the power into the plasma over many 
minutes, was announced. The production of net electrical power from fusion is planned for the next 
generation experiment after ITER.

   Unfortunately, this task is not easy, as scientists thought early. Fusion reactions require a very large 
amount of energy to initiate in order to overcome the so-called Coulomb barrier or fusion barrier 
energy. The key to practical fusion power is to select a fuel that requires the minimum amount of 
energy to start, that is, the lowest barrier energy. The best fuel from this standpoint is a one-to-one mix 
of deuterium and tritium; both are heavy isotopes of hydrogen. The D-T (Deuterium & Tritium) mix 

2

has a low barrier energy. In order to create the required conditions, the fuel must be heated to tens of 
millions of degrees, and/or compressed to immense pressures.

  At present, D-T is used by two main methods of fusion: inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and 
magnetic confinement fusion (MCF)(for example, tokamak).

In inertial confinement fusion (ICF), nuclear fusion reactions are initiated by heating and 
compressing a target. The target is a pellet that most often contains deuterium and tritium (often only 
micro or milligrams). Intense laser or ion beams are used for compression. The beams explosively 
detonate the outer layers of the target. That accelerats the underlying target layers inward, sending a 
shockwave into the center of pellet mass. If the shockwave is powerful enough and if high enough 
density at the center is achieved some of the fuel will be heated enough to cause fusion reactions. In a 
target which has been heated and compressed to the point of thermonuclear ignition, energy can then 
heat surrounding fuel to cause it to fuse as well, potentially releasing tremendous amounts of energy.
  Fusion reactions require a very large amount of energy to initiate in order to overcome the so-called 
Coulomb barrier or fusion barrier energy.

  Magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors, magnetic 
fields can also confine fusion fuel. A variety of magnetic configurations can be used, the basic 
distinction being between magnetic mirror confinement and toroidal confinement, especially tokamaks 
and stellarators.

  Lawson criterion. In nuclear fusion research, the Lawson criterion, first derived by John D. Lawson 
in 1957, is an important general measure of a system that defines the conditions needed for a fusion 
reactor to reach ignition, that is, that the heating of the plasma by the products of the fusion reactions 
is sufficient to maintain the temperature of the plasma against all losses without external power input. 
As originally formulated the Lawson criterion gives a minimum required value for the product of the 
plasma (electron) density ne and the "energy confinement time" τ. Later analyses suggested that a more 
useful figure of merit is the "triple product" of density, confinement time, and plasma temperature T. 
The triple product also has a minimum required value, and the name "Lawson criterion" often refers to 
this inequality.

The key to practical fusion power is to select a fuel that requires the minimum amount of energy to 
start, that is, the lowest barrier energy. The best fuel from this standpoint is a one-to-one mix of 
deuterium and tritium; both are heavy isotopes of hydrogen. The D-T (Deuterium & Tritium) mix has 
a low barrier.

In order to create the required conditions, the fuel must be heated to tens of millions of degrees, and/or 
compressed to immense pressures. The temperature and pressure required for any particular fuel to 
fuse is known as the Lawson criterion. For the D-T reaction, the physical value is about

where T is temperature, [KeV],  1 eV = 1.16104 oK; ne is matter density, [1/сm3]; n is matter density, 
[1/m3];  is time, [s]. Last equation is in metric system. The thermonucler rection of  2H + 3D realises if 
L > 1020 in CI (meter, kilogram, second) units or L > 1014 in 'cgs' (cantimetr, gram, second) units. 

This number has not yet been achieved in any reactor, although the latest generations of machines have 
come close. For instance, the reactor TFTR has achieved the densities and energy lifetimes needed to 
achieve Lawson at the temperatures it can create, but it cannot create those temperatures at the same 
time. Future ITER aims to do both.

The Lawson criterion applies to inertial confinement fusion as well as to magnetic confinement fusion 
but is more usefully expressed in a different form. Whereas the energy confinement time in a magnetic 
system is very difficult to predict or even to establish empirically, in an inertial system it must be on 
the order of the time it takes sound waves to travel across the plasma:

3



R
/
imkT

where  is time, s; R is distance, m; k is Boltzmann constant; mi is mass of ion, kg.

Following the above derivation of the limit on neτE, we see that the product of the density and the 
radius must be greater than a value related to the minimum of T3/2/<σv>  (here  is Boltzmann 
constant, v is ion speed). This condition is traditionally expressed in terms of the mass density ρ:  ρR > 
1 g/cm² .

To satisfy this criterion at the density of solid D+T (0.2 g/cm³) would require an implausibly large 
laser pulse energy. Assuming the energy required scales with the mass of the fusion plasma (Elaser ~ 
ρR3 ~ ρ-2), compressing the fuel to 103 or 104 times solid density would reduce the energy required by 
a factor of 106 or 108, bringing it into a realistic range. With a compression by 103, the compressed 
density will be 200 g/cm³, and the compressed radius can be as small as 0.05 mm. The radius of the 
fuel before compression would be 0.5 mm. The initial pellet will be perhaps twice as large since most 
of the mass will be ablated during the compression.

The fusion power density is a good figure of merit to determine the optimum temperature for magnetic 
confinement, but for inertial confinement the fractional burn-up of the fuel is probably more useful. 
The burn-up should be proportional to the specific reaction rate (n²<σv>) times the confinement time 
(which scales as T1/2) divided by the particle density n:

                burn-up fraction ~ n²<σv> T-1/2 / n ~ (nT) (<σv>/T3/2) 

Thus the optimum temperature for inertial confinement fusion is that which maximizes <σv>/T3/2, 
which is slightly higher than the optimum temperature for magnetic confinement.

Short history of thermonuclear fusion. One of the earliest (in the late 1970's and early 1980's) 
serious attempts at an ICF design was Shiva, a 20-armed neodymium laser system built at the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) that started operation in 1978. Shiva was a "proof 
of concept" design, followed by the NOVA design with 10 times the power. Funding for fusion 
research was severely constrained in the 80's, but NOVA nevertheless successfully gathered enough 
information for a next generation machine whose goal was ignition. Although net energy can be 
released even without ignition (the breakeven point), ignition is considered necessary for a practical
power system.

The resulting design, now known as the National Ignition Facility, commenced being constructed at 
LLNL in 1997. Originally intended to start construction in the early 1990s, the NIF is now six years 

4

behind schedule and overbudget by over $1.4 billion. Nevertheless many of the problems appear to be 
due to the "big lab" mentality and shifting the focus from pure ICF research to the nuclear stewardship 
program, LLNLs traditional nuclear weapons-making role. NIF is now scheduled to "burn" in 2010, 
when the remaining lasers in the 192-beam array are finally installed.

Laser physicists in Europe have put forward plans to build a £500m facility, called HiPER, to study a 
new approach to laser fusion. A panel of scientists from seven European Union countries believes that
a "fast ignition" laser facility could make a significant contribution to fusion research, as well as 
supporting experiments in other areas of physics. The facility would be designed to achieve high 
energy gains, providing the critical intermediate step between ignition and a demonstration reactor. It 
would consist of a long-pulse laser with an energy of 200 kJ to compress the fuel and a short-pulse 
laser with an energy of 70 kJ to heat it.

Confinement refers to all the conditions necessary to keep a plasma dense and hot long enough to 
undergo fusion:

 Equilibrium: There must be no net forces on any part of the plasma, otherwise it will rapidly 



disassemble. The exception, of course, is inertial confinement, where the relevant physics must 
occur faster than the disassembly time. 
Stability: The plasma must be so constructed that small deviations are restored to the initial state, 
otherwise some unavoidable disturbance will occur and grow exponentially until the plasma is 
destroyed. 

 Transport: The loss of particles and heat in all channels must be sufficiently slow. The word 

"confinement" is often used in the restricted sense of "energy confinement". 

To produce self-sustaining fusion, the energy released by the reaction (or at least a fraction of it) must 
be used to heat new reactant nuclei and keep them hot long enough that they also undergo fusion 
reactions. Retaining the heat generated is called energy confinement and may be accomplished in a 
number of ways.

The hydrogen bomb weapon has no confinement at all. The fuel is simply allowed to fly apart, but it 
takes a certain length of time to do this, and during this time fusion can occur. This approach is called 
inertial confinement (fig.1). If more than about a milligram of fuel is used, the explosion would 
destroy the machine, so controlled thermonuclear fusion using inertial confinement causes tiny pellets 
of fuel to explode several times a second. To induce the explosion, the pellet must be compressed to 
about 30 times solid density with energetic beams. If the beams are focused directly on the pellet, it is 
called direct drive, which can in principle be very efficient, but in practice it is difficult to obtain the 
needed uniformity. An alternative approach is indirect drive, in which the beams heat a shell, and the 
shell radiates x-rays, which then implode the pellet. The beams are commonly laser beams, but heavy 
and light ion beams and electron beams have all been investigated and tried to one degree or another. 

They rely on fuel pellets with a "perfect" shape in order to generate a symmetrical inward shock wave
to produce the high-density plasma, and in practice these have proven difficult to produce. A recent 
development in the field of laser-induced ICF is the use of ultra-short pulse multi-petawatt lasers to 
heat the plasma of an imploding pellet at exactly the moment of greatest density after it is imploded 
conventionally using terawatt scale lasers. This research will be carried out on the (currently being 
built) OMEGA EP petawatt and OMEGA lasers at the University of Rochester and at the GEKKO XII 
laser at the Institute for Laser Engineering in Osaka Japan which, if fruitful, may have the effect of 
greatly reducing the cost of a laser fusion-based power source.

gigantic size of laser installation for reactor. Cost is some billions of dollars.

At the temperatures required for fusion, the fuel is in the form of a plasma with very good electrical 
conductivity. This opens the possibility to confine the fuel and the energy with magnetic fields, an idea 
known as magnetic confinement (fig.2). 

Much of this progress has been achieved with a particular emphasis on tokamaks (fig.2).

Fig. 2. Magnetic thermonuclear reactor. The size of the installation is obvious if you compare it with 
the “Little Blue Man” inside the machine at the bottom. Cost is some tens of billions of dollars.

In fusion research, achieving a fusion energy gain factor Q = 1 is called breakeven and is considered a 
significant although somewhat artificial milestone. Ignition refers to an infinite Q, that is, a self-

6

sustaining plasma where the losses are made up for by fusion power without any external input. In a 
practical fusion reactor, some external power will always be required for things like current drive, 
refueling, profile control, and burn control. A value on the order of Q = 20 will be required if the plant 
is to deliver much more energy than it uses internally.

In a fusion power plant, the nuclear island has a plasma chamber with an associated vacuum system, 
surrounded by a plasma-facing components (first wall and divertor) maintaining the vacuum boundary 
and absorbing the thermal radiation coming from the plasma, surrounded in turn by a blanket where 
the neutrons are absorbed to breed tritium and heat a working fluid that transfers the power to the 
balance of plant. If magnetic confinement is used, a magnet system, using primarily cryogenic 
superconducting magnets, is needed, and usually systems for heating and refueling the plasma and for 
driving current. In inertial confinement, a driver (laser or accelerator) and a focusing system are 
needed, as well as a means for forming and positioning the pellets.

The magnetic fusion energy (MFE) program seeks to establish the conditions to sustain a nuclear 
fusion reaction in a plasma that is contained by magnetic fields to allow the successful production of 
fusion power.

In thirty years, scientists have increased the Lawson criterion of the ICF and tokamak installations by 
tens of times. Unfortunately, all current and some new installations (ICF and totamak) have a 
Lawrence criterion that is tens of times lower than is necessary (fig.3).

regime allowing thermonuclear ignition with high gain lies near the upper right corner of the plot.

Innovation

7

As you can see in the Equation for thermonuclear reaction (reaction’s "ignition") it is necessary to 
rapidly and greatly increase the target-enveloping temperature, the density of target proper and to 
shorten the time of the operation in order to keep the fuel in these precisely induced conditions. In ICF 
the density of plasma is very high (1028 m-3, it increases in 20-30 times in target), the temperature 
reaches tens of millions oK, but time is measured in nanoseconds. As a result, the Lawson criterion is 
tens to hundreds of times lower than is required. In a tokomak, the time is mere parts of second and the 
ambient temperature is tens of millions of degrees, but density of plasma is very small (1020 m-3). The 
Lawson criterion is also tens to hundreds of times lower than needed.
  The author offers some innovations and names these reactors as AB-reactors.. The main innovations 
are below. 
  Multi-reflect reactor (MRR). The first innovation suggested early in 1983 [14] and developed later 
in [1]-[26] for multi-reflex engine and space propulsion. Conventional ICF has conventional inside 
surface of the combustion chamber. This surface absorbs part of the heat radiation emanating from the 
pellet and plasma, the rest of the radiation reflects in all directions and is also absorbed by walls of 
combustion chamber. As result the target loses energy expensively delivered by lasers. This loss is so 
huge that we need very powerful lasers and we cannot efficiently heat the target to reach ignition 
temperature (Lawson’s criterion). In all current ICF installations this loss is tens of times more than is 
acceptable.
  The innovative ICF has, on the inside surface of combustion chamber, a covering of small Prism 
Reflectors (PR) (figs.4,5) (or multi-layer reflector. Note: Multi-layer reflector can only reflect the laser 
beam). The system of prism reflectors has great advantages in comparison with conventional mirror 
and especially with conventional combustion chamber. The advantages are listed:
1. The prism reflector has very high efficiency. The coefficient of its radiate absorption is less about 

million times the rate of the conventional mirror. 

2. The prism mirror reflects the radiation in widely diapason of continuous spectrum.  A conventional 
mirror reflects the radiation only in narrow diapason of continuous spectrum. That means that any 
conventional mirror has big absorption of radiation energy even if it has high reflectivity (up 99%) 
in narrow interval of the continuous spectrum. The prism reflector allows to use the thermal plasma 
radiation.

3. The prism reflector bounces the heat radiation exactly to a point where heat beam comes up, even 
if it has defect at position. The conventional mirror having small defect in position (or the pellet is 
not located exactly in center of sphere) destroys the pellet.

4. According with Point 3 above, the prism reflector may be used in cylindrical (toroidal) camera 

(fig.5) (tokomak, stellarator). A conventional mirror cannot be employed because reflected ray will 
be sent in the other direction.  

5. The prism reflector can uniformly distribute the beam energy in pellet surface. The small spherical 
plasma pellet reflected the scattered radiation. That means the laser beam after the first reflection 
reflects on semi-sphere, after two reflections that presses on full sphere, after 3 - 4 reflection the 
pressure is almost uniformly. That decreases a number of needed laser beams, simplify, and 
decreases cost of laser installation.

  In particular, this innovation may be used in already built current reactors for their improvement.

   Self-Magnetic reactor (SMR) (Figs. 6,7). The magnetic pressure is proportional to the inverse value 
of electric conductor diameter. (The conventional magnetic reactor has a diameter of plasma flex some 
meters). The high temperature plasma has excellent conductivity which does not depend from plasma 
density. If the diameter is decreased to 0.1 mm and electric currency is high, the magnetic pressure is 
increased by hundreds or thousand times and that can keep the high-density plasma.  Thus, the plasma 
is confined by self-generated magnetic field (and by pinch-effect) and it does not need in powerful 
outer magnetic field created very complex, high cost super-conductivity system! This innovation in 
MCF is dramatically decreasing the size of reaction zone and using of gaseous compression fuel pellet 
(micro-capsule) in magnetic confinement reactor.
   The other innovation in SMR is uses the electric current (electric impulse) for initial heating of 
microcapsule targets. That means we don't need a large, very complex and expensive laser (or ion 
beam) system for inertial confinement reactor or induce system in magnetic confinement reactor. That 

9

is possible in special design of the fuel microcapsule. The energy for heating of the microcapsule to 
thermonuclear temperature is small and conventional condensers may be used for it.
  The some innovations are magnetic and radiation stoppers (confinements) of plasma in ends of the 
fuel capsule. It is suggested two methods:
1) The capsule has conic ends (fig. 7d). The capsule radius decreases at ends. That means the 

2)

magnetic intensity will increase at the capsule ends (up 10 and more times). They will work as 
magnetic mirror (plasma stopper) (fig. 7).
 Our magnetic field has other direction and form then it is in conventional tokomak. In tokomak 
the magnetic lines are parallel to a toroid (or cylinder) axis. In our SMR the magnetic lines are 
circles around cylindrical capsule. That means there is an axis magnetic force which put obstacles 
a heat transfer from plasma to electric electrodes. That works as radial and axial magnetic stopper.

  There are others innovations which reader can apprehend in comparison the offered micro AB-
reactors and current and under construction reactors.
  These innovations decrease the size, weight and the monetary cost of thermonuclear reactors by 
thousands of times and allow the widespread future construction of thermonuclear electric stations, 
engines, and space propulsions.
  The offered self-magnetic reactor has the following differences in comparison with Z -machine of 
Sandia Laboratory (USA). Z-machine used a set of very fine tungsten wires running around the fuel 
would be "dumped" with the current instead. The wires would quickly vaporize into a plasma, which is 
conductive, and the current flow would then cause the plasma to pinch. The key difference is that the 
plasma would not be the fuel, as in our SMCF, but used solely to generate very high-energy X-rays as 
the metal plasma compressed and heated. The x-rays would compress a tiny fuel cylinder containing 
deuterium-tritium mix, in the same fashion that the X-rays generated from a nuclear bomb compress 
the fuel load in an H-bomb. The superpower x-ray output pulse (up 2.7 megajouls!) generated by 
heavy tungsten metal plasma ( W74
in the magnetic field (an "electromagnetic pulse") also generates strong electric current in all of the 
metallic objects in the room and demiges electronic devices.
   In our machime the small fuel cylinder has a thin conductive layer from light metall. The capsule can 
also have contactivity filaments into fuel. They help to produce initial heating of fuel plasma (up 104 
105 oK) and initial the plasma compression (rocket and/or inertial). The father plasma heating and 
confinement is produced by voltage curve of fig.17 which create self-magnetic field equil (or more) 
plasma gas pressure.

  Summary. This work offers two types of micro-AB-thermonuclear reactors: by multi-reflex radiation 
confinement of plasma and self-magnetic confinement. They can use high and low density fuel 
(compressed gas or liquid/frizzed fuel) and they can work in pulse or continuous regimes. 
  The offered micro-AB-reactor with self-magnetic confinement includes: micro fuel capsule with 
compressed gaseous or liquid (frizzed) fuel; two electric electrodes, and a combustion chamber.
Internal surface of combustion chamber is covered by prism or multi-layer reflectors.
  The capsule contains thermonuclear fuel (it conventionally has two component, example D + T), and 
conducting capsule shell. Fuel may be composed by conducting fiber for quick heating. The capsule 
has the conic ends.
  The electric electrodes have windings for creating magnetic locks, canals for feeding of fuel capsule 
(or injector for liquid fuel), and electron injector (electric currency). Last may be electron (currency) 
emitter. Electrodes also contain a cooling system and thermo-protection.
  The suggested reactor works the following way. The strong impulse electric current passes through 
capsule. The capsule shell explodes, creating an initial plasma flux and compressed, heating, and 
creating initial fuel plasma fuse. The plasma radiation erupts and part of them returns and compresses 
the plasma, helping the electric current to heat the plasma to its ignition temperature.

  We spoke about micro AB-reactors. But it does not mean that power of them is small. In next articles 
I will discuss the methods for transformation and utilization of the thermonuclear energy into other 
types of energy and propulsion.  These completed research show the power of micro AB-reactor can 
reach some thousands of kW.
  The computations of the offered reactors are presented below.

Theory of current thermonuclear reactor

Methods of confinement in current reactors

Magnetic confinement. Magnetic fields can confine fusion fuel because plasma is a very good 
electrical conductor. A variety of magnetic configurations can be used, the most basic distinction being 
tokamaks and stellarators.

Inertial confinement. A third confinement principle is to apply a rapid pulse of energy to a large part 
of the surface of a pellet of fusion fuel, causing it to simultaneously "implode" and heat to very high 
pressure and temperature. If the fuel is dense enough and hot enough, the fusion reaction rate will be 
high enough to burn a significant fraction of the fuel before it has dissipated. To achieve these extreme 
conditions, the initially cold fuel must be explosively compressed. Inertial confinement is used in the 
hydrogen bomb, where the driver is x-rays created by a fission bomb. Inertial confinement is also 
attempted in "controlled" nuclear fusion, where the driver is a laser, ion, or electron beam.

Some other confinement principles have been investigated, such as muon-catalyzed fusion, the 
Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor (inertial electrostatic confinement), and bubble fusion.

In man-made fusion, the primary fuel is not constrained to be protons and higher temperatures can be 
used, so reactions with larger cross-sections are chosen. This implies a lower Lawson criterion, and 
therefore less startup effort. Another concern is the production of neutrons, which activate the reactor 
structure radiologically, but also have the advantages of allowing volumetric extraction of the fusion 
energy and tritium breeding. Reactions that release no neutrons are referred to as aneutronic.

In order to be useful as a source of energy, a fusion reaction must satisfy several criteria. It must:











be exothermic - This may be obvious, but it limits the reactants to the low Z (number of protons) 
side of the curve of binding energy. It also makes helium 4He the most common product because of 
its extraordinarily tight binding, although 3He and 3H also show up. 
involve low Z nuclei - This is because the electrostatic repulsion must be overcome before the 
nuclei are close enough to fuse. 
have two reactants - At anything less than stellar densities, three body collisions are too 
improbable. It should be noted that in inertial confinement, both stellar densities and temperatures 
are exceeded to compensate for the shortcomings of the third parameter of the Lawson criterion, 
ICF's very short confinement time. 
have two or more products - This allows simultaneous conservation of energy and momentum 
without relying on the (weak!) electromagnetic force. 
conserve both protons and neutrons - The cross sections for the weak interaction are too small. 

Few reactions meet these criteria. The following are those with the largest cross-sections:

p (protium), D (deuterium), and T (tritium) are shorthand notation for the main three isotopes of 
hydrogen.

For reactions with two products, the energy is divided between them in inverse proportion to their 
masses, as shown. In most reactions with three products, the distribution of energy varies. For 
reactions that can result in more than one set of products, the branching ratios are given.

Some reaction candidates can be eliminated at once. The D-6Li reaction has no advantage compared to 
p-11B because it is roughly as difficult to burn but produces substantially more neutrons through D-D 
side reactions. There is also a p-7Li reaction, but the cross-section is far too low except possible for Ti
> 1 MeV, but at such high temperatures an endothermic, direct neutron-producing reaction also 
becomes very significant. Finally there is also a p-9Be reaction, which is not only difficult to burn, but 
9Be can be easily induced to split into two alphas and a neutron.

In addition to the fusion reactions, the following reactions with neutrons are important in order to 
"breed" tritium in "dry" fusion bombs and some proposed fusion reactors:

n + 6Li → T + 4He ,
n + 7Li → T + 4He + n .

To evaluate the usefulness of these reactions, in addition to the reactants, the products, and the energy 
released, one needs to know something about the cross section. Any given fusion device will have a 
maximum plasma pressure that it can sustain, and an economical device will always operate near this 
maximum. Given this pressure, the largest fusion output is obtained when the temperature is selected 
so that <σv>/T² is a maximum. This is also the temperature at which the value of the triple product nTτ 

13

required for ignition is a minimum. This chosen optimum temperature and the value of <σv>/T² at that 
temperature is given for a few of these reactions in the following table.

Note that many of the reactions form chains. For instance, a reactor fueled with T and 3He will create 
some D, which is then possible to use in the D + 3He reaction if the energies are "right". An elegant 
idea is to combine the reactions (8) and (9). The 3He from reaction (8) can react with 6Li in reaction (9) 
before completely thermalizing. This produces an energetic proton which in turn undergoes reaction 
(8) before thermalizing. A detailed analysis shows that this idea will not really work well, but it is a 
good example of a case where the usual assumption of a Maxwellian plasma is not appropriate.

Any of the reactions above can, in principle, be the basis of fusion power production. In addition to the 
temperature and cross section discussed above, we must consider the total energy of the fusion 
products Efus, the energy of the charged fusion products Ech, and the atomic number Z of the non-
hydrogenic reactant.

Specification of the D-D reaction entails some difficulties, though. To begin with, one must average 
over the two branches (2) and (3). More difficult is to decide how to treat the T and 3He products. T 
burns so well in a deuterium plasma that it is almost impossible to extract from the plasma. The D-3He 
reaction is optimized at a much higher temperature, so the burn-up at the optimum D-D temperature 
may be low, so it seems reasonable to assume the T but not the 3He gets burned up and adds its energy 
to the net reaction. Thus we will count the D-D fusion energy as Efus = (4.03+17.6+3.27)/2 = 12.5 
MeV and the energy in charged particles as Ech = (4.03+3.5+0.82)/2 = 4.2 MeV.

Another unique aspect of the D-D reaction is that there is only one reactant, which must be taken into 
account when calculating the reaction rate.

With this choice, we tabulate parameters for four of the most important reactions.

The last column is the neutronicity of the reaction, the fraction of the fusion energy released as 
neutrons. This is an important indicator of the magnitude of the problems associated with neutrons like 
radiation damage, biological shielding, remote handling, and safety. For the first two reactions it is 
calculated as (Efus-Ech)/Efus. For the last two reactions, where this calculation would give zero, the 
values quoted are rough estimates based on side reactions that produce neutrons in a plasma in thermal 
equilibrium.

Of course, the reactants should also be mixed in the optimal proportions. This is the case when each 
reactant ion plus its associated electrons accounts for half the pressure. Assuming that the total 
pressure is fixed, this means that density of the non-hydrogenic ion is smaller than that of the 
hydrogenic ion by a factor 2/(Z+1). Therefore the rate for these reactions is reduced by the same factor, 
on top of any differences in the values of <σv>/T². On the other hand, because the D-D reaction has 
only one reactant, the rate is twice as high as if the fuel were divided between two hydrogenic species.

Thus, there is a "penalty" of (2/(Z+1)) for non-hydrogenic fuels arising from the fact that they require 
more electrons, which take up pressure without participating in the fusion reaction. There is, at the 
same time, a "bonus" of a factor 2 for D-D due to the fact that each ion can react with any of the other 
ions, not just a fraction of them.

We can now compare these reactions in the following table 4.

The maximum value of <σv>/T² is taken from a previous table. The "penalty/bonus" factor is that 
related to a non-hydrogenic reactant or a single-species reaction. The values in the column "reactivity" 
are found by dividing (1.24×10-24 by the product of the second and third columns. It indicates the 
factor by which the other reactions occur more slowly than the D-T reaction under comparable 
conditions. The column "Lawson criterion" weights these results with Ech and gives an indication of 
how much more difficult it is to achieve ignition with these reactions, relative to the difficulty for the 
D-T reaction. The last column is labeled "power density" and weights the practical reactivity with Efus. 
It indicates how much lower the fusion power density of the other reactions is compared to the D-T 
reaction and can be considered a measure of the economic potential.

Bremsstrahlung (brake) losses

Bremsstrahlung, (from the German bremsen, to brake and Strahlung, radiation, thus, "braking 
radiation"), is electromagnetic radiation produced by the acceleration of a charged particle, such as an 
electron, when deflected by another charged particle, such as an atomic nucleus. The term is also used 
to refer to the process of producing the radiation. Bremsstrahlung has a continuous spectrum. The 
phenomenon was discovered by Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) during high frequency research he 
conducted between 1888 and 1897.

15

Bremsstrahlung may also be referred to as free-free radiation. This refers to the radiation that arises as 
a result of a charged particle that is free both before and after the deflection (acceleration) that causes 
the emission. Strictly speaking, bremsstrahlung refers to any radiation due to the acceleration of a 
charged particle, which includes synchrotron radiation; however, it is frequently used (even when not 
speaking German) in the more literal and narrow sense of radiation from electrons stopping in matter.

The ions undergoing fusion will essentially never occur alone but will be mixed with electrons that 
neutralize the ions' electrical charge and form a plasma. The electrons will generally have a 
temperature comparable to or greater than that of the ions, so they will collide with the ions and emit 
Bremsstrahlung. The Sun and stars are opaque to Bremsstrahlung, but essentially any terrestrial fusion 
reactor will be optically thin at relevant wavelengths. Bremsstrahlung is also difficult to reflect and 
difficult to convert directly to electricity, so the ratio of fusion power produced to Bremsstrahlung 
radiation lost is an important figure of merit. This ratio is generally maximized at a much higher 
temperature than that which maximizes the power density (see the previous subsection). The following 
table shows the rough optimum temperature and the power ratio at that temperature for several 
reactions.

The actual ratios of fusion to Bremsstrahlung power will likely be significantly lower for several 
reasons. For one, the calculation assumes that the energy of the fusion products is transmitted 
completely to the fuel ions, which then lose energy to the electrons by collisions, which in turn lose 
energy by Bremsstrahlung. However because the fusion products move much faster than the fuel ions, 
they will give up a significant fraction of their energy directly to the electrons. Secondly, the plasma is 
assumed to be composed purely of fuel ions. In practice, there will be a significant proportion of 
impurity ions, which will lower the ratio. In particular, the fusion products themselves must remain in 
the plasma until they have given up their energy, and will remain some time after that in any proposed 
confinement scheme. Finally, all channels of energy loss other than Bremsstrahlung have been 
neglected. The last two factors are related. On theoretical and experimental grounds, particle and 
energy confinement seem to be closely related. In a confinement scheme that does a good job of 
retaining energy, fusion products will build up. If the fusion products are efficiently ejected, then 
energy confinement will be poor, too.

The temperatures maximizing the fusion power compared to the Bremsstrahlung are in every case 
higher than the temperature that maximizes the power density and minimizes the required value of the 
fusion triple product (Lawson criterion). This will not change the optimum operating point for D-T 
very much because the Bremsstrahlung fraction is low, but it will push the other fuels into regimes 
where the power density relative to D-T is even lower and the required confinement even more 
difficult to achieve. For D-D and D-3He, Bremsstrahlung losses will be a serious, possibly prohibitive 

16

problem. For 3He-3He, p-6Li and p-11B the Bremsstrahlung losses appear to make a fusion reactor 
using these fuels impossible.

In a plasma, the free electrons are constantly producing Bremsstrahlung in collisions with the ions. The 
power density of the Bremsstrahlung radiated is given by

Te is the electron temperature, α is the fine structure constant, h is Planck's constant, and the "effective" 
ion charge state Zeff is given by an average over the charge states of the ions:

                                                 Zeff = Σ (Z²nZ) / ne

This formula is derived in "Basic Principles of Plasmas Physics: A Statistical Approach" by S. 
Ichimaru, p. 228. It applies for high enough Te that the electron deBroglie wavelength is longer than 
the classical Coulomb distance of closest approach. In practical units, this formula gives

PBr = (1.69×10-32 /W cm-3) (ne/cm-3)2 (Te/eV)1/2 Zeff
= (5.34×10-37 /W m-3) (ne /m-3)2 (Te /keV)1/2 Zeff

  Where Wcm-3, cm-3, eV, Wm-3, m-3, keV are units of correcponding magnitudes. For very high 
temperatures there are relativistic corrections to this formula, that is, additional terms of order Te/mec2.

Computed estimations of AB-Reactors

 We consider two new Micro-AB-Reactors having the innovative: multi-reflect radiation and self-
magnetic confinement features.
  In multi-reflect radiation confinement of AB-Reactor the offered innovation is the special prisms, a 
high reflectivity mirror that returns the laser beam exactly to its point of origination. As a result, the all 
energy absorbs by plasma, the laser radiation multi-times presses the plasma and impedes it or, at least, 
it does not allow its expansion. The plasma has high reflectivity and this press effect may be increased 
hundreds to thousands of times. Practically speaking, we are weakly limited and can use the cheap and 
solid fuel. 
  The uniformly heating of target by laser beam is very big and important problem in ICF. The non-
equal rocket forces on target shell destroy the capsule before thermonuclear ignition. If the first ICF 
reactor had some laser beams, the second generation had 10 laser beams (NOVA), the third generation 
has 60 beams (OMEGA), and the next generation will have 192 beams (NIF). All laser beams must be 
equal and work in coordination - that is complex, difficult and expensive problem. The prism reflector 
is easy designed such the reflected beam runs round the target and presses it uniformly from all sides
after 2 - 4 reflections.
  The second innovation is the special form microcapsule that is filled by compression gas or liquid 
(frozen) fuel. 
  In self-magnetic confinement Micro-AB-Reactor main innovation is super thin microcapsule and 
electric heating which produce high-intensity magnetic field, keeping the plasma pressure and conic 
(or close to conic) ends of ampoule capsule which work as plasma stoppers. The important innovation 

20

is the using an electric currency for straight heating of capsule. The magnetic lines in our reactor are 
circles located into and around plasma channel. The magnetic intensity increases from central axis to 
maximal plasma radius. That pushes plasma into center of plasma channel. In the ends of plasma 
channel the magnetic forces put obstacles in plasma leakage.  

  For estimation possibilities of these innovations in the first AB-reactor we compute the multi-
reflection pressure, the condition of plasma reflection and compare them with dynamic pressure of 
plasma. In the second AB-reactor we consider the equilibrium the magnetic and kinetic pressures.

  Capsules. For multi-reflex conformation is more suitable the spherical capsule. Let us consider the 
gas compressed fuel capsule. The shell thickness and relative weight of gas compressed fuel spherical 
capsule can be computed by equations:

stress, N/m2; MR is relative capsule mass; s is density of capsule shell, [kg/m3]; f is density of fuel, 
[kg/m3]. 
  Example, for gas pressure P = 100 atm = 107 N/m2,  = 200 kgf/mm2 = 2109 N/m2, s = 1800 kg/m3; 
f = 11 kg/m3 (at P = 100 atm) we get /r = 2.510-3, MR = 0.6 .     
Cylindrical capsula  (l >> r). For our estimations we take the capsule having the length 1 mm, radius
r = 0.05 mm, cross section area S  810-3 mm3, fuel volume Vc = 810-3 mm3 = 810-12 m3. That is 
very small.  It is a microcapsule.
 If the gas in a microcapsule is pressed the relative thickness and relative mass of cylindrical shell may 
be computed by equations:

of Tritium is 1.5 more). For D and other pressure the n must be changed in same times, for example, if 
P = 100 atm then f = 8.75 kg/m3, n  2.61027 1/m3, nc = 20.81015; n  2.11028 1/m3, nc = 1.71017   
(f = 71 kg/m3) for liquid hydrogen at a pressure of 1 atm. (In conventional inertial confinement fusion
reactor, the fuel density may be more in 10 - 30 times, under a rocket pressure of a fuel capsule cover. 
For hydrogen the frizzed temperature is -259.34 oC, the boiling point is -252.87 oC). For D+T average

where Er is reaction energy of one couple particles, eV; N = 1 + 2 is number of nucleons which 
take part in reaction, for D+T N = 2+3=5.  If we want compute energy of one type of particles, the Er
is reaction energy for given type of particles, for D+T the energy Er = 17.5 MeV;. For example, our 
capsule (10.1 mm) filled by liquid fuel D+T has fuel mass Mf = 0.7110-3 g and will produce energy 
Ec = 240 kJ. If we burn out 10 capsules per 1 s, the engine power will be 2400 kW. An estimated 20% 
this energy gives the charged particles and 80% of neutrons. The fuel capsule having M = 10 g =10-5
kg of a mixture D+T produces 3.34109 J if all atoms take part in reaction. That is equivalent to the 
energy derived from 84 liters of benzene.

   Unfortunately, as you can see (in Table 1), most particle energy catches the neutron as the lightest 
particle. But its emission has high penetrating capability, creating radioactive isotopes, causing 
damage to the main construction, very dangerous for living beings, and that can be converted only in 
heat energy.

   Energy is needed for fuel heating. This energy can be estimated by equation:

That is energy of electric condenser having size about 101010 cm for  = 108 V/m (see below).

density of dielectric, kg/m3. Energy from capacitor is about one joule from one centimeter cub.
  Electron plasma frequency. Electron frequency of plasma is computed by equation (8). For n  1020
1/m3 that is equals pe = 5.641011 rad/s, for n  1028 1/m3 that equals pe = 5.641015 rad/s . That is more 
then the laser frequency ( = 0.310-9 m,   = 2.11010 rad/s). That means the plasma will reflect the laser 
beam.   
  Plasma skin depth. The depth in plasma to which an electromagnetic radiation can penetrate (Eq. (9)) is: 
For n  1020 1/m3 that is equals dp = 5.3110-2 cm, for n  1028 1/m3 that equals dp = 5.3110-6 cm. As you 
see, the depth is small.
  Coefficient reflectivity of plasma. No data about plasma reflectivity. However, from general theory of 
reflectivity it is known the reflectivity depends from conductivity (see Eq. (14)). Silver has the best 
conductivity from solid body and best reflectivity. It is about q = 0.78  0.99 (it depends from frequency 
of radiation: for ultra-violet radiation q  0.78, for thermal radiation q  0.99). The plasma for T > 15106
oK has better conductivity then silver. The plasma conductivity increases as T3/2. That means the plasma 
having the T  108 oK has reflectivity in 17.2 times better then silver. That means the plasma reflectivity is 
more 0.999. We take in our computation q = 0.999. The efficiency of offered innovation very strong

depends from reflectivity of plasma. The reflectivity of the prism mirror is very high [23]. We neglect the 
loss in it.

Fig. 12 (right). Spectra of brake radiation for plasma temperature 200 - 1000 millions degrees (oK).

The ultra-violet rays are below approximately < 31017 hertz ( >10-9 m), the soft x-rays are below < 

31019 hertz ( >10-11 m). That means the brake radiation can be reflected by special methods. For 
example, the silver having high electro-conductivity has average reflectivity 0.99 in heat region, 0.95 
in light region, and 0.78 in ultra-violet region. Some metals has reflectivity up 0.2 for   = 4010-9 m.  
But plasma having the temperature more than 15106 oK has more electro-conductivity then silver and 
it must, therefore, have better reflectivity. The reflectivity coefficient of prism mirror is very high and 
we can neglect its losses. However, the reflectivity of prism mirror for brake radiation is needed in a 
detailed test.

For very high temperature the most part of this spectrum is in the soft x-ray region, but soft x-ray can 
be reflected and retracted by special methods.
    The reactive pressure.  We can estimate that the ion speed for T =108 oK. That is approximately V

510-6 m2 the capsule cover pressure is p = F/s = 1013 N/m2 = 108  atm. This pressure produces the 
shockwave which compresses the fuel microcapsule and create high ion temperature.

Fig. 13. Equilibrium of multi-reflex laser pulse power versus plasma density and fuel capsule surface S
for coefficient plasma reflectivity q = 0.999, plasma temperature Tk = 108 oK.

Look your attention that power of laser pulse for multi-reflection confinement is in tens - hundreds 
times less then one is in the current ICF reactors (OMEGA has 601012 W, Z-machine will have 
3501012 W). That shows, the multi-reflect conformation is more efficiency then rocket conformation 
for small targets.
  We can increase the initial multi-reflex pressure in millions times if we cover the outer capsule 
surface the small reflective prism as internal surface of the combustion chamber. As it is shown in [26]

25

p. 378, fig. A3.4, the pressere from 1 kW of laser power can reach more 104 N. If laser pulse power 
has PL= 1013 W, the pressure will be F = 1017 N. The surface of a spherical capsule having diameter 1 
mm is about S = 3 mm2=310-6 m2. Hence the pressure on target is P = F/S =3.31022 N/m2 = 3.31017
atm! That is in 109 times more then a gas dynamic pressure of the plasma at temperature 108 K.
  Note. The rocket force used for compressing and heating pullet at present time cannot keep the big 
pressure           
and temperature for very small capsules at need time because gas extension. For example, let us to 
estimate the extension time for two capsules having diameter d = 0.3 mm and d = 3 mm respectively at 
temperature 108 K. The average ion speed at this temperature is about 6105 m/s. For typical pulse 
time 10-9 s the plasma radius is increased in 610-4 m = 0.6 mm. That means the volume of the first 
capsule increases in (0.75/0.15)3 = 125 times, the volume of the second capsule is increased only in 
(2.1/1.5)3 = 2.7 times. In our multi-reflex reactor the beam pressure does not allow to expansion the 
plasma and increases the reaction time and possibility thermonuclear reaction in hundreds times.    
  
Requested minimum time of laser pulse. Duration of laser pulse needed for heating of capsule can 
be computed by equation

most part beam energy is reflected by plasma and heating the shell of combustion chamber. In our

The self-magnetic confinement.

   The self-magnitude confinement is suitable for low-density plasma. Your attention is called for to the 
big difference between a present conventional reactor magnetic field and the offered self-magnetic 
field. For creating of the present magnetic field, the large powerful superconductivity very expensive 
magnets are used. Our self-magnetic does not request anything. The self-magnetic field is produced by 
capsule electric current and that is more powerful by hundreds of times. Why? The magnetic intensity
and pressure of electric current in inverse proportion of plasma radius (see equations (29) below). The 
present thermonuclear reactor has plasma camera of some meters. Our capsule has radius only 0.05 
mm.

Projects

  Below there are estimations of some projects, which show parameters of suggested AB-reactors. 
These are not optimal reactors. They demonstrate the methods of computations and possible technical 
data of new micro reactors.  
1. Multi-reflection AB-reactor. Let us to take the spherical fuel capsule diameter d = 1 mm. Its 

surface is 3.14 mm2, the volume is v = 0.52 mm3=5,210-10 m3. If gaseous fuel (D+T) has pressure 
1, 10, 100 atm, the specific fuel density are  = 0.11 kg/m3, 1.1 kg/m3,  11 kg/m3 respectively. The 
fuel mass are Mf =  = 5.710-11,  5710-11,  57010-11 kg respectively. Particle densities are n1 = 
.mp = 2.631025 1/m3, 2.631026 1/m3,  2.631027 1/m3 respectively. Numbers of particles in the 
/a
capsule are n = n1v = 1.371016,  1.371017,  1.371018 respectively. 
  Thermonuclear energy in capsule are E = 0.5nE1 = 1.9104 J, 1.9105 J, 1.9106 J respectively. 
Here E1 = 17.61061.610-19 = 2.810-12 J is the energy in single reaction of couple particles.
Where 17.6106 MeV is thermonuclear energy of reaction D+T. If we burn 1 capsule in 1 second,
the thermonuclear power will be W = 1.9104 W, 1.9105 W, 1.9106 W respectively.  

      Fuel heating energy are Ef = c1MfTk = 24 J, 240 J, 2400 J respectively. Here c1 = 4.13103 is 
average thermal capacity of plasma, Tk = 108 K is maximal plasma temperature. These heating 
energy must be increased some (3  6) times because we must to heat the capsule shell and 
coefficient of energy efficiency is less then 1. The current condensers have energy storage capability 
about 1 J/cm3.

       Requested minimum (equilibrium) pulse laser power equal N = 17.1109 W, 17.11010 W, 

17.11011 W respectively (Eq. (22)) for q = 0.999. Pulse time is = Ef /N = 1.410-9 s.

      We can use the liquid fuel. All parameter significantly will improvement (approximately in 10 

times with comparison of the 100 atm capsule), but we get a problem with storage of capsules into a 
liquid helium.

2. Self-magnetic AB-reactor. Let us to take the fuel capsule of the length L = 1 mm, diameter 2r = 0.1 
mm and gaseous fuel (D+T) pressure p = 100 atm . The cross-section of capsule is S = 7.8510-3
mm2, volume v = 7.8510-12 m3, fuel mass is  Mf =  = 9.510-11 kg, particle density is n1 = 
.mp = 2.631027 1/m3, number of particle into capsule is n = n1v = 2.061016. Heating fuel energy 
/a
is Ef = c1MfTk = 39 J, for Tk = 108 K. If we burn 1 capsule in 1 second the thermonuclear power will 
be W = 3104 W.

      Requested minimum (equilibrium) electric currency equal I = 1.07106 A (for Tk = 108 K),(Eq. 
(29)). The plasma electric specific resistance at Tk = 108 K is  = 0.1Z/T3/2 = 1.2310-7  sm. The 
electric plasma resistance is Rf = L/S = 1.510-4   (all for Tk = 108 K). Voltage U = IRf = 160 V. 
Pulse power N = IU = 17.1107 W. Pulse time is  = 2.310-6 s. Maximum intensity of magnetic 
field is B = oI/2r = 4280 T.   

Discussion

  The offered thermonuclear AB-Reactors, as with any innovations, are needed in further more detailed 
laboratory research, product development and testing. However, theses new Reactors have gigantic 
advantages over present-day thermonuclear reactors:

1. They are cheaper by many hundreds of times. That means not only non-industrial countries but 
middle-size companies can undertake R&D and production of perfected new thermonuclear 
reactors.

2. They have a small weight and size but they have enough power (up 10,000 kW). That means they 
can be used as engine of  land vehicles, small ships, aircraft, manned and unmanned spacecraft 
propulsion and community power utilities. 

3. They are not limited in high temperature regime as are all existing reactors. That means they can 

use inexpensive fuel (not deuterium, tritium, helium-3, uranium as do extant reactors).     

  The parameters of AB-Reactors are considered and computed in given article very far from optima. 
They are only examples utilized to vividly illustrate the large possibilities of the innovative reactors.

 The suggested AB-thermonuclear reactor has Lawson criterion in some order more then conventional 
current (2005) thermonuclear reactors (ICF). That strongly increases either of three multipliers in 
Lawson criterion. That increases the density n up to two-three orders. It increases the temperature T. It 
returns the laser and thermal radiation back to fuel pellet. (This emission is lost in present reactors). It 
increases the time of reaction .   The suggested AB thermonuclear reactors may be a revolutionary 
jump in energy industry.

   Note: In conventional ICF the initial (internal into plasma) radiation does not compress the plasma. 
Plasma is transparency for internal radiation. That emission influences only to an emitted particle. 
When radiation came out of source (fuel pellet) and reflected or adsorbed by chamber surface that does 
not press on pellet surface. By that means, the conventional inertial thermonuclear reactor has only 
losses from radiation. The offered AB Reactor has the big desirable benefits from thermal radiation. 
The more radiation, the more benefits.
  The offered AB-Reactor can also have problems. The radiation mirror can have a bad reflectivity for 
ultra-violent rays or experimenters may have problems with fast high-intensity electric impulse 
through small capsule. However, if mirror will be reflect only conventional ultra-violet, light, and 
thermal radiations that would be enough for ignition of a thermonuclear reaction. As any innovation 
the offered reactor needs further perfecting R&D.

30

  The offered AB-self magnetic reactor is different from present magnetic confinement reactor. That is 
smaller because AB-self-magnetic reactor works a small fuel capsule. In present-day reactor, the rare 
fuel gas (D+T) fills all volume of large chamber. In AB-Reactor the fuel is located into small capsule 
under high pressure (or, as solid, liquid or frizzed fuel under conventional pressure). In this case the 
fuel density can reach n = 10-26  10-27 1/m3 (or solid, liquid, frozen fuel may be inside conductive 
matter, n = 10-28  10-29 1/m3). If the plasma reflectivity is high (q > 0,99), that is enough for 
thermonuclear ignition and keeping plasma under the radiation pressure and magnetic pressure. For 
current MCF the magnetic intensity is 5 T. For AB-Self-MCF the magnetic intensity may be about 104
T. For AB-radiation reactor the radiation pressure is about 1010  1013 N/m2 (millions atm) (fig.15). 
We can neglect the outer magnetic force in AB-Reactor and we may design AB-Self-MCF reactor 
without very complex and expensive superconductivity magnetic system.

Abstract.

By means of the Helmholtz theorem on the decomposition of vector fields,

the angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field is decomposed, in a general

and manifestly gauge invariant manner, into a spin component and an orbital component.

The method is applied to linearly and circularly polarized plane waves in their classical and

quantum forms.

1. Introduction

[1-4].

The notion of light containing orbital and spin components of angular momentum

has become of interest in the past decade. For paraxial rays, that accurately describe laser

light, the nature of the division into the two components appears now to be well understood

However, for more general electromagnetic fields a simple, plausible and general

derivation of these components from the expression for the angular momentum J(t) of the

classical electromagnetic field in terms of the electric E(x,t) and magnetic field B(x,t) [5]

J(t) = 1

(Gaussian units, bold font denotes a three-vector) seems to be lacking. Some authors [6] use

decompositions that are not manifestly gauge invariant. Other decompositions lack

generality [7]. In this paper, by applying the vector decomposition theorem of Helmholtz to
the electric field, following [8], we obtain a decomposition of the angular momentum of the

classical electromagnetic field into orbital and spin components that is quite general and

manifestly gauge invariant throughout because it involves the fields only and not the
potentials.

In section 2 we perform the Helmholtz decomposition, in section 3 we obtain

general expressions for the orbital and spin parts of the classical electromagnetic field. In

section 4 we apply the prescription to classical linearly and circularly polarized plane

waves and discuss the apparent paradox that plane waves give rise to. In section 5 we show

that when the prescription is applied to plane waves quantized in the Coulomb gauge it

reproduces the standard forms for the orbital and spin angular momentum of the free

photon. In section 6 we apply the same arguments to the linear momentum.

2. Helmholtz decompositions

The vector decomposition theorem of Helmholtz [9-11] states that any 3-vector

field E(x) that vanishes at spatial infinity can be expressed, up to a uniform vector (see

Appendix), as the sum of two terms

E(x,t) = -(cid:209)

x f (x,t) + (cid:209)

· F(x,t)

(2)

where  (cid:209)
functions are

x is the gradient operator with respect to x and the scalar f and vector F potential

| x - y |

4p

and 

F(x,t) = d 3y

.

(3)

· E(y,t)
| x - y |

The first term of (2) is known as the longitudinal part, the second as the transverse part. It is

argued elsewhere [10-12] that the Helmholtz theorem applies to fields that vary with time.

If the field is the electromagnetic E field then, after using Maxwell equations, the two

potential functions become

f (x,t) = d3 y

(y,t)

and 

F(x,t) = -

where  (y,t) is the electric charge density and B the magnetic Maxwell field.

We see that the Helmholtz theorem decomposes the Maxwell electric field into

gradients of the electromagnetic Coulomb gauge potentials  E = -(cid:209)

f - At / ct. The

was obtained previously [10, 11] by making a Helmholtz decomposition of the
electromagnetic vector potential. The term At is the irreducible part of the electromagnetic
vector potential that encodes all the information about the magnetic field [11]. The pure

gauge term of the electromagnetic vector potential, which is the gradient of an arbitrary

scalar field, does not encode any physical information.

When the electromagnetic E field is decomposed as in equation (2) one part of it,

that involving the gradient in (2), is necessarily associated with the presence of electric

charge (bound or b) and one part, that involving the curl in equation (2) (free or f), is not

necessarily associated with the presence of electric charge. In this sense, the fields in an

irregularly shaped metal cavity will be said to be free although they do not have the form of

plane waves. The categorization applies to any physical quantities that depend on E, such

as the angular momentum.

The electromagnetic B field may also be decomposed by means of the Helmholtz

theorem. Because (cid:209)

.B = 0, there is only one term in the decomposition and, with the use of

the inhomogeneous Maxwell equation

The first term is an instantaneous Biot-Savart term, the second term accounts for time
dependence of the fields. These Helmholtz decompositions all have the feature that they are

formally instantaneous in time.

3. Angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field

To calculate the angular momentum of the classical electromagnetic field we

decompose the E field according to (2) and (4) and substitute the result into (1).

Angular momentum of light

The bound angular momentum has orbital character because it contains the coordinate

vectors explicitly.

4. Plane waves: classical

It is desirable to verify that the equations developed in the last section are consistent

with known results. To do this we apply them to the classical and quantum cases of plane

waves of the electromagnetic field.

A linearly polarized classical plane wave propagating in the z direction has

magnetic field  B(x,t)  =   ˆ x Bsin( t - kz)   with time derivative

B(x', t) / t  =  

ˆ x Bcos(

t - kz')  . There is also an electric field in the y direction. The cross

product of the two vectors in (14) vanishes so the spin angular moment is zero. The scalar

product is

B(x,t). B(x', t) / t = B2
2

{sin[ k(z'- z) ] + s i n [ 2 t - k(z + z')] }

(20)

The time average of the second term vanishes and from (16) the time-averaged orbital

angular momentum is

1

=

J fo

(4 p c) 2 d3 x

d 3x'

sin[k(z'- z)]

x · x'
| x - x'|3

(21)

.

.

This integrand is odd under the transformation x ﬁ

 - x and x' ﬁ

 - x' and so the integral

vanishes. Consequently both the spin and time-averaged orbital angular momentum of a

linearly polarized plane wave vanish.

A circularly polarized plane wave propagating in the z direction has magnetic field

components

B(x,t) = ˆ x Bcos(

t - kz) + ˆ y Bsin(

t - kz)

(22)

and from its time derivative we obtain from (14)

=

J fs

ˆ z  B2
(4 p c) 2 d3 x

d 3x'

cos[k(z'- z)]
| x - x'|

.

(23)

The integral  d3 x'

 gives 4p /k2 so we get a vector density of spin angular

cos[k(z'- z)]
| x - x'|

momentum B2/4p

 in the z direction. In calculating the orbital angular momentum from

(16) we get  B(x,t). B(x', t) / t = B2{sin[ k(z'- z)]} and hence an expression similar to

(21). The orbital angular momentum therefore vanishes. We find that the circularly

polarized classical plane wave has a finite volume density of spin angular momentum

B2/4p

 but a zero volume density of orbital angular momentum. The energy density of the

wave is B2/4p

 so the ratio of spin angular momentum density to energy density is 1/w

.

It is well known on the basis of experiment [13] and theory [14] and is confirmed

by the calculation above that a circularly polarized plane wave carries spin angular

momentum whereas a linearly polarized one does not. At first sight this seems inconsistent

with (1) because, from the vector form of that equation, the angular momentum density can

have no component in a direction perpendicular to the plane of E and B. The matter has

been the subject of discussion for a long time [15] and even recently [16-19]. The

resolution of the paradox is that an obstacle that absorbs angular momentum changes the

electromagnetic field at the edges of the obstacle so as to give the fields in that region a

component in the direction of propagation. This gives rise to a Poynting vector that is not

parallel to the direction of propagation and to an angular momentum vector that is. The

issue has been discussed most clearly by Simmons and Guttman [20] who explain

qualitatively that by partial integration the angular momentum-producing effects that occur

at the edges of an obstacle may be viewed as occurring over the volume of the obstacle. It

is this partial integration that has been carried out in a more complete way in section 3 of

this paper.

Angular momentum of light

An examination of the surface term that arises as a result of the partial integration of

(10) shows [23] that for a circularly polarized wave it contributes a term that is equal and

opposite to that given by the volume term, giving a total angular momentum of zero, in

accordance with the predictions of (1). However, if the infinite wave is constricted by an

aperture of finite size and the surface of integration is taken just outside the boundary of a

section of the constricted wave then the surface term vanishes and only the volume term

remains. In this way a reconciliation is effected between the naïve predictions of (1) and the

experiments of Beth [13].

5. Plane waves: quantum mechanical

A photon is the quantized normal mode of the electromagnetic field and, as such,

the division of its angular momentum into spin and orbital parts depends on the shape of

the particular normal mode. In order to compare our results with known ones we again

consider the simplest case of plane waves, this time quantized in the Coulomb gauge (div A

= 0, zero scalar potential). The vector potential of such a linearly polarized wave is

 from the properties of the

The only surviving term of the spin angular momentum operator is (28). It is therefore not

necessary to normal-order the Fock operators to obtain (28).

have integrals like

The real part of this integral is zero. The imaginary part oscillates rapidly as L ﬁ

 ¥

 and it is

stationary only when q ﬁ

 0. However, in this limit, the integral itself vanishes and so does

the orbital angular momentum. The reader may object that if the origin of coordinates is not

chosen to be at the centre of the normalization volume a non-zero result will be obtained.

However, if it is accepted that the vacuum is invariant under spatial inversion, then any

simulation of the vacuum, such as by a normalization box, must be invariant under

inversion too. Accordingly, the origin of coordinates must be taken to be at the centre of the

box and the integral vanishes. We find that the second-quantized orbital angular momentum

of a plane wave is zero, as expected from the classical situation discussed in the previous

section. The correspondence with the classical situation is complete. The second-quantized
angular momentum of bound fields is obtained by substituting (25) in (19).

7. Conclusion

We have obtained a decomposition of the angular momentum of the classical

electromagnetic field into orbital and spin components that is general and manifestly gauge

invariant. This is done by decomposing the electric field into its longitudinal and transverse
parts by means of the Helmholtz theorem. The orbital and spin components of the angular

momentum of any specified electromagnetic field can be computed from this prescription.

We find that the results agree with the known expressions for the angular momentum
components of classical linearly and circularly polarized plane waves and plane waves

quantized in the Coulomb gauge. It is not necessary to normal-order the Fock operators to

obtain the quantum mechanical results.

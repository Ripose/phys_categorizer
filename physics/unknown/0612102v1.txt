Abstract 

Based on Maxwellian quaternionic electromagnetic theory, the electromagnetic interaction, 
gravitational interaction and their coupling influence with the dark matter field in octonionic 
space are discussed. The research results disclose the close relationships of dark matter field 
with  electromagnetic  interaction  and  gravitational  interaction  respectively.  In  the  modified 
gravitational  interaction,  the  near  coplanarity,  near  circularity  and  corevolving  of  planetary 
orbits are deduced from the equations set. The change of centrifugal force of celestial body 
leads  to  fluctuation  of  revolution  speed,  when  the  field  energy  density,  celestial  body’s 
angular momentum in its sense of revolution or its mass spatial distribution varied. In the dark 
matter  field,  the  equations  set  reveal  the  movement  properties  of  dark  matter  in  certain 
conditions and its influence on ordinary matter movements. The research results explain that 
some  observed  abnormal  phenomena  about  celestial  bodies  are  caused  by  either  modified 
gravitational interaction or dark matter. 

 
Keywords:  gravitational  interaction;  dark  matter;  electromagnetic  interaction;  octonion  space; 
quaternion space.

1. Introduction 
 
Nowadays,  there  still  exist  some  movement  phenomena  of  celestial  body  which  can’t  be 
explained by current gravitational theory. Therefore, some scientists doubt the universality of 
current  gravitational  theory,  and  then  bring  forward  the  modified  gravitational  theory  and 
hypothesis of dark matter to explain the phenomena of abnormal rotation velocity of galaxy 
and the associated ‘missing mass’ etc. [1]. The hypothesis of dark matter believes that, there 
exist not only various gleamy ordinary matters, but also one kind of mysterious matter which 
exerts the gravitational pull, but neither emits nor absorbs light. This kind of matter is known 
as  dark  matter,  which  owns  mass  and  has  effect  on  ordinary  matter  movements.  Most 
scientists believe that its existence and multiformity in the universe [2].

The understanding of the time and space experiences an evolutional period. In 17th century, 
I. Newton thought the time and space in nature were separate. And the time and space were 
both independent of matter. In 20th century, A. Einstein believed that, the time and space in 
nature  were  integrated  and  commonly  known  as  the  spacetime.  The  spacetime  related  to 
movement status and matter. The precursors include R. Descartes and A. Einstein etc. held the 
idea  that  space  and  time  were  the  extension  of  matter.  And  there  was  no  such  spacetime 
without matter and hence no empty spacetime [3 , 4]. 

We believe that electromagnetic interaction and gravitational interaction are different, equal 
and relative.  And they possess different and four-dimensional spacetime respectively.  These 
two types of different and four-dimensional spacetime are equal and independent, and can not 
be superposed directly. The viewpoint can be summarized as ‘spacetime equality postulation’, 
that is: each fundamental interaction possesses its own spacetime, and all these spacetime are 
equal. 

According  to  previous  research  results  and  the  spacetime  equality  postulation,  the 
electromagnetic  interaction  and  gravitational  interaction  can  be  described  by  the  four- 
dimensional spacetime. Based on the conception of space verticality etc., two types of four- 
dimensional  spacetime  can  be  united  into  an  eight-dimensional  spacetime.  In  the  eight- 
dimensional  spacetime,  the  electromagnetic  interaction  and  gravitational  interaction  can  be 
equally  described.  So  the  characteristics  of  electromagnetic  interaction  and  gravitational 
interaction can be described by eight-dimensional spacetime uniformly. 

The paper modifies the gravitational theory of ordinary matter and dark matter, and draws 
some  conclusions  which  are  consistent  with  the  Maxwellian  electromagnetic  theory  and  the 
Newtonian  gravitational  theory.  A  few  prediction  associated  with  movement  feature  of  dark 
matter can be deduced, and some new and unknown particles can be used for the candidate of 
dark matter. 
 
 
2. Electromagnetic field and quaternion space 
 
The  electromagnetic  theory  can  be  described  with  quaternion  algebra  [5].  In  treatise  on 
electromagnetic  theory,  the  quaternion  was  first  used  by  J.  C.  Maxwell  to  describe  the 
equations  set  and  various  properties  of  electromagnetic  field  [6].  The  spacetime,  which  is 
associated  with  electromagnetic  interaction  and  possesses  of  physics  content,  is  adopted  by 
the quaternionic space. 

In quaternionic space (E space, for short) of electromagnetic interaction, the base Ee = (1, 
), and the displacement Re = (r0 , r1 , r2 , r3 ). Where, r0 = ct, c is the speed of light

In quaternionic space, the various properties among field potential, field strength and field 
source  of  electromagnetic  interaction  can  be  described  by  quaternion.  According  to  the 
spacetime  equality  postulation,  it  can  be  deduced  that  the  spacetime  derived  from 
gravitational  interaction,  is  supposed  to  be  the  quaternionic  space  also.  Given  that  the 
coupling influence of fundamental interaction is neglected, the gravitational interaction is the 
same as electromagnetic interaction and can also be described by quaternion. 
 
 
3. Electromagnetic-gravitational field and octonionic space 
 
The  electromagnetic  interaction  and  gravitational  interaction  are  interconnected,  unified  and 
equal. Both of them can be described in quaternionic space. By means of the conception of 
space expansion etc., two types of quaternionic space can combine into an octonionic space 
[7].  In  the  octonionic  space,  various  characteristics  of  electromagnetic  interaction  and 
gravitational 
interaction  can  be  described  uniformly,  and  some  equations  set  of 
electromagnetic-gravitational field can be obtained. 

The  base  Eg  of  the  quaternionic  space  (G  space,  for  short)  of  gravitational  interaction  is 
, 
). So the base Ee of E space and the base Eg of G space constitute a base E of octonionic 

independent  of  the  base  Ee  in  E  space.  Selecting  Eg  =  (1,  iv

In  octonionic  space,  there  are  four  types  of  field  source  in  electromagnetic-gravitational 
field.  There  exist  two  parts  of  field  source  in  electromagnetic  interaction,  one part  lies  in  E 
space  (1,  iv
).  So  does  the 
gravitational interaction. 
 
3.4    Force 
 
The force can be defined by field source S, field strength B and operator  ⃟. The field force 
F and variation rate of field source J are defined as 

v
,  K

v
,  J

                                                          F = B ◦ S                                                                  (18a) 
                                                          J =  ⃟  ◦ S                                                                (18b) 
The definition of variation rate of field source J is different from that of field force F . But 
both of them have effects on the matter particle. The field force F includes the Lorentz force 

 

6

[8], while the variation rate of field source J includes the inertia force [9]. 
 
3.5    Angular momentum and energy 
 
The  physical  quantity  including  angular  momentum,  work,  kinetic  energy,  potential  energy 
and force moment etc. can be defined by field source S, field strength B, displacement R, 
physical quantity X and operator  ⃟. 

The angular momentum M is defined as ( krx is the coefficient) 

                                                        M = S ◦ (R + krx X )                                                      (19) 

The work and moment derived from the field force are defined uniformly as 

                                            W1 = B*◦ (S ◦R) + B*◦ (krx S ◦X )                                            (20) 
where,  the  physical  quantity  B*◦  (S  ◦X )  is  one  new  part  of  energy.  The  mark  (*)  denotes 
octonionic conjugate. 

The  kinetic  energy,  potential  energy  and  moment  derived  from  the  variation  rate  of  field 

source are defined uniformly as 
                                          W2 =  ⃟*◦ (S ◦R ) +  ⃟*◦ (krx S ◦X )                                        (21) 
where, the physical quantity  ⃟*◦ (S ◦X ) is the part of potential energy. 

Both definitions of energy W1 and W2 exclude the potential energy S ◦A , if the definition 
of angular momentum is confined in M = S ◦R . Hence this definition of angular momentum 
is inexact apparently. As shown in Aharonov-Bohm experiment [10], the field potential A = 
⃟*◦X has effects on the energy  ⃟*◦ (krx S ◦X ), which includes the potential energy S ◦A . 
And the change of field potential can impact the movement of field source. 
 
 
4. Equations set of electromagnetic-gravitational field 
 
In octonionic electromagnetic-gravitational field, two types of force can be written together as 
follow from Eqs.(18a) and (18b) 
                                                Z = F + c J   
                                                    = B ◦ S + c  ⃟◦ S = (B + c  ⃟) ◦ S                                  (22) 
And two types of energy can also be written as follow from Eqs.(20) and (21) 
                                              W = W1 + cW2 = (B + c  ⃟)* ◦ M                                        (23) 
The unified definitions of force Eq.(22) and energy Eq.(23) show that, previous equations 
set  of  the  quaternionic  electromagnetic  field  and  octonionic  electromagnetic-gravitational 
field  should  be  supplemented  and  generalized.  It  also  shows  that  the  octonionic  differential 
operator  ⃟   needs  to  be  generalized  to  ( ⃟ +B/c).  The  physical  characteristics  of 
electromagnetic-gravitational field can be described from many aspects. 
 
4.1    Field source equation 
 
The  extended  definition  of  force  Eq.(22)  shows  that,  the  field  source  S  needs  to  be  revised 
and generalized to the form of the following equation from Eq.(13). 
                                                      μS = (B + c  ⃟)* ◦ (B/c)                                                (24) 

 

7

As  a  part  of  field  source  S,  the  item  B*  ◦B includes  field  energy  density.  In  the  Eq.(22), 
when force Z = 0, we obtain the force-balance equation of electromagnetic-gravitational field. 
And the variation of field energy density, (B*◦B/c) is one kind of necessary portion of force. 
 
4.2    Power equation 
 
The extended definition of energy Eq.(23) shows that, the power N need to be revised and 
generalized to the form of the following equation. 
                                                            N = (B + c⃟) ◦ W                                                    (25) 
In  the  electromagnetic-gravitational  field,  the  physical  quantity  X  has  effect  on  the  field 
potential  ⃟*◦ X , angular momentum S ◦ X , energy B* ◦ (S ◦ X) and power (B ◦ B*) ◦ (S ◦ 
X) . The introduction of physical quantity X makes the definition of angular momentum M 
and energy W more integrated, and the theory more self-consistent.   

In  Eqs.(23)  and  (25),  the  conservation  of  angular  momentum  in  electromagnetic- 
gravitational field can be gained when W = 0, and energy conservation of electromagnetic- 
gravitational field can be attained when N = 0. 
 
4.3    Dark matter 
 
There exist four types of subfield and their field source of electromagnetic-gravitational field. 
In  Table  3,  the  electromagnetic-electromagnetic  subfield  and  gravitational-gravitational 
subfield  are  ‘electromagnetic  field’  and  ‘modified  gravitational  filed’  respectively.  Their 
general  charges  are  E  charge  and  G  mass  respectively.  The  electromagnetic-gravitational 
subfield and gravitational-electromagnetic subfield are both long range fields and candidates 
of ‘dark matter field’.  Their general charges (G  charge and E  mass) are candidates of ‘dark 
matter’. The physical features of the dark matter meet the requirement of Eqs.(11), (12), (19), 
(22), (23), (24) and (25) . 

e, Qe

In the general charge (Qe

g ) and intermediate particle (photon γ, etc.), two 
types of general charge (E charge and G mass) and one type of intermediate particle (photon γ) 
have  been  found.  Hence  the  remaining  two  types  of  general  charge  and  three  types  of 
intermediate particle are left to be found in Table 3. 

e and Qg

g, Qg

The  particles  of  ordinary  matter  (electron  and  proton  etc.)  possess  the  E  charge  together 
with G mass. The particles of dark matter may possess the G charge with E mass, or G mass 
with  G  charge,  etc.  It  can  be  predicted  that  field  strength  of  electromagnetic-gravitational 
subfield  and  gravitational-electromagnetic  subfield  must  be  very  weak  and  less  than  that  of 
the  gravitational-gravitational  subfield.  Otherwise  they  should  be  detected  for  a  long  time. 
Hence  the  field  strength  of  electromagnetic-gravitational  subfield  and  gravitational- 
electromagnetic subfield may be equal, and a little less than that of gravitational-gravitational 
subfield.

5. Particle movement 
 
In Eqs.(22) and (24), the field sources (current and momentum) stays in force-balance status 
in  electromagnetic-gravitational  field  when  Z  =  0.  The  influence  between  ‘modified 
gravitational 
field’ 
(electromagnetic-gravitational  subfield  and  gravitational-electromagnetic  subfield)  on  force 
can  be  discussed  using  this  feature.  In  Eq.(23),  the  conservation  of  angular  momentum  in 
electromagnetic-gravitational  field  can  be  achieved  when  W  =  0.  The  influence  between 
‘modified gravitational field’ and ‘dark matter field’ on angular momentum and energy can be 
discussed with this property. 
 
5.1    Linear movement 
 
In gravitational-gravitational subfield (G01 , 0 , 0), the particle is in free-fall movement and its

When G12 = 0, we can learn that particle m moves around object M in planar ellipse from 
above equations. That is the near circularity of planets. When G01 = G02 = 0, it can be found 
that the particle m moves in planar circumference from above equations. That is the rotation 
of  planets.  Therefore,  in  gravitational-gravitational  subfield  (G01  ,  G02  ,  G12 ),  the  centroid 
movement of the particle m is the superposition of these two types of movement. That is, the 
center  of  planar  circumference  movement  of  particle  moves  in  planar  ellipse.  When  the 
particle  m  moves around big mass M,  the  movement of particle m is in revolution, rotation 
and  swing  because  of  weakness  and  nonuniform  distribution  of  G12.  It  shows  that,  the 
‘magnetic’ part G12 of gravitational-gravitational subfield affects the movement of particle m, 
and is one of important factors resulting in rotation of particle m [11].

g), as certain parts of inertia 
force,  will  affect  the  planar  helix  movement  of  particle.  In  the  solar  system,  when  spatial 
distribution of planetary mass, field energy density or planetary angular momentum along the 
direction  perpendicular  to  the  Ecliptic  Plane  are  invariable,  the  movement  of  planet  is 
consistent  with  the  Newtonian  gravitational  theory.  In  the  Milky  Way  Galaxy,  when  spatial 
distribution of solar system mass, field energy density or angular momentum of solar system 
along the direction perpendicular to the Galactic Equator Plane varies, the centrifugal force of 
solar  system  will  change  and  the  movement  of  solar  system  will  betray  the  Newtonian 
gravitational theory. If the change of mass, energy density and momentum lead to counteract 
the  certain  parts  of  centrifugal  force,  it  will  result  in  the  revolution  speed  increase  of  solar 
system to generate enough centrifugal force to balance the gravitational of Milky Way Galaxy. 
The inferences can solve inconsistency between overspeed rotation of galaxy and deficiency 
of gravitation in some extent [12].

The  last  two  items  of  above  equations  show  that,  the  change  of  energy  density  in 
gravitational-gravitational  subfield  and  electromagnetic-electromagnetic  subfield  will 
influence the movement of particle m. When the last two items of above equations are zero 
and keg = 1, the equations of gravitational-gravitational subfield can be summarized as follow.

From above equations we can learn that, when the sense of revolution of particle m is in the 
same sense of rotation of object M, the movement of particle m is attracted by the force which 
points  to  the  orbit  plane,  hence  the  movement  of  particle  m  is  stable.  That  is  the  near 
coplanarity of planets. The particle m, which moves around object M in spatial helix, revolves 
and waves up and down slowly around the equator plane of object M (the earth’s movement 
relatives to the equator plane of the sun; the movement of solar system and pulsar relative to 
the  galactic  plane  of  the  Milky  Way  Galaxy),  at  the  same  time  it  rotates  with  swing  [13]. 
When the sense of revolution of particle m is in opposite sense of rotation of object M, the 
movement of particle m is repelled by the force which deviates from the orbit plane and hence 
the  movement  of  particle  m  is  unstable.  It  shows  that,  the  sense  of  revolution  of  particle  m 
affects directly its movement stability. That is corevolving (or prograde) of planets. Therefore, 
the solar system and galaxy are inclined to thin disk structure as a whole [14]. 

To  be  extended,  two  galaxies  rotating  in  the  same  sense  of  rotation  are  in  attraction  and 
revolution around each other, even shorten their interval and swallow up each other to become 
one galaxy. Two galaxies rotating in opposite senses of rotation will repel and increase their 
interval.  Two  galaxies  rotating  in  arbitrary  senses  of  rotation  will  be  affected  by  more 
complicated forces and moment [15].

large-mass  object  M  which  maintain  its  rotation  simultaneously.  When  particle  m,  which 
moves around M in spatial helix, stays in conservation of angular momentum,

In  the  gravitational-gravitational  subfield,  the  above  equations  set  show  that,  the 
conservation of angular momentum will be affected by the field strength, angular momentum 
and its variation rate. When M1

When all items in the right side of equal marks of above equations set are zero, the angular 
e along the sense of revolution of particle m, is in conservation. And if the right 
momentum M3
side of equal mark of the last equation is approximately to zero, whilst the right side of equal 
e is close to be in 
marks of the first three equations are not all zero, the angular momentum M3
conservation and more complicated situations will appear on the revolution orbit of particle m. 
For example, the asteroid will probably come near to the planet gradually, and the moon may 
perhaps keep away from the earth [16, 17]. 
 
5.7    Planar helix movement of dark matter 
 
The field strength of gravitational-gravitational subfield and electromagnetic-electromagnetic 
subfield, which in equator plane of large-mass object M, are (G01 , G02 , G12 ) and (g01 , g02 ,

In above equations set, the first two equations are the movement equations of gravitational- 
gravitational subfield, including the affecting from the gravitational-electromagnetic subfield. 
The last two equations are the movement equations of gravitational-electromagnetic subfield, 
including the influence from gravitational-gravitational subfield. It shows that there exists the 
influence  between  ‘dark  matter  field’  (gravitational-electromagnetic  subfield)  and  ‘modified 
gravitational field’ (gravitational-gravitational subfield). When the second item is zero in the 
above  equations,  there  is  no  relationship  between  the  ‘dark  matter  field’  (gravitational- 
electromagnetic  subfield)  and  the  ‘modified  gravitational  field’  (gravitational-gravitational 
subfield). 

If the preceding field strength and field source are extended to four types of field strength 
and field source of electromagnetic-gravitational field, many extra and also more complicated 
equations set of interplay between ‘dark matter field’ and ‘modified gravitational field’, will 
be gained from Eqs.(22) and (23). 
 
 
6. Conclusions 
 
In  the  observed  phenomena  of  celestial  body,  which  are  inconsistent  with  the  results  of 
current  gravitational 
the  modified  gravitational  field 
(gravitational-gravitational  subfield)  in  electromagnetic-gravitational  field,  and  some  are 
caused  by  the  dark  matter  field  (electromagnetic-gravitational  subfield  and  gravitational- 
electromagnetic subfield). 

theory,  some  are  caused  by 

The gravitational-gravitational subfield is the  modified gravitational field, which includes 
familiar Newtonian gravitational field. The modified gravitational features predict that, (1) the 
planetary orbits possess the near coplanarity, near circularity and corevolving, and the planets 
own  rotation  property,  (2)  the  centrifugal  force  of  celestial  body  will  change  and  lead  to 
fluctuation  of  revolution  speed,  when  the  field  energy  density  or  the  angular  momentum  of 
celestial body along the sense of revolution varied, (3) the two galaxies rotating in the same 

 

14

sense of rotation will attract and revolve around each other, hence shorten their interval and 
swallow up each other to become one galaxy. 

The  electromagnetic-gravitational  subfield  and  gravitational-electromagnetic  subfield  are 
both  long  range  fields  and  candidates  of  dark  matter  field.  Their  general  charges  are 
candidates of dark matter. The combination of above general charges and the general charges 
of  the  gravitational-gravitational  subfield  or  electromagnetic-electromagnetic  subfield  are 
candidates  of  dark  matter  also.  The  field  strength  of  electromagnetic-gravitational  subfield 
and gravitational-electromagnetic subfield may be equal and very weak, and a little less than 
that  of  gravitational-gravitational  subfield.  The  features  of  dark  matter  predict  that,  (1)  the 
dark matter field possess two types of field source, make the dark matter particles diversiform, 
(2)  the  field  strength  of  two  types  of  dark  matter  field  are  both  weaker  than  that  of  the 
Newtonian  gravitational  filed,  (3)  the  distribution  of  dark  matter  can  affect  the  stabilizing 
velocity  of  celestial  body.  If  field  sources  of  electromagnetic-gravitational  subfield  and 
gravitational-electromagnetic  subfield  can  be  distributed  properly,  the  obtained  gravity  of 
celestial  body  will  increase,  and  the  stabilizing  velocity  of  celestial  body  will  also  increase 
correspondingly.

Synopsis 

The  fit  of  a  set  of  simulated  noisy  EXAFS  spectra  samples  the  frequency 

distribution  of  structural  parameters  and  gives  their  statistical  estimators  (mean, 

dispersion, correlations). 

Abstract 

The frequency distribution of different parameters of an EXAFS spectrum can be 

directly  sampled  by  analysing  a  population  of  simulated  spectra  produced  by  adding 

computer-generated noise to a reference pattern. 

The  procedure  gives  statistical  estimators  of  the  parameters  obtained  with 

different data processing strategies to test the performance of a strategy, to evaluate the 

bias  introduced  by  random  noise,  and  to  clarify  the  amount  of  information  actually 

contained in an experimental spectrum.  

Results are given for the two simple local structures of an Ag atom surrounded by 

two oxygens or by six iodines. 

 

1. Introduction 

EXAFS  (Extended  X-Ray  Absorption  Fine  Structure)  is  well  recognised  as  a 

powerful  and  now  popular  tool  for  investigating  local  structural  features  in  different 

kinds  of  materials.  Strong  points  of  the  technique  are  its  well  assessed  theoretical 

background  [see,  for  instance,  Rehr  2000],  the  ability  to  provide  information  on  the 

environment of a chemically defined scattering centre, and the possibility to deal with 

different  kinds  of  materials,  from  liquids  or  disordered  solids  to  well  crystallised 

samples. The popularity of EXAFS determinations has also greatly increased in recent 

years because of the rapid diffusion of specialised software [Filipponi DiCicco & Natoli 

1995, Filipponi & Di Cicco 1995, Binsted 1998, Rehr 1994 and recent versions of the 

FEFF programme]. 

Aim  of  this  paper  is  to  give  a  first  contribution  to  the  problems  concerning 

accuracy and reliability of these interesting determinations. Indeed, these aspects have 

received so far only little attention and, to the knowledge of the present Authors, only a 

few papers [Incoccia and Mobilio, 1984, Lytle et al., 1989, Filipponi, 1995, Curis and 

Benazeth,  2000,  Krappe  and  Rossner,  2000,]  are  available  on  this  regard  in  the 

literature. Indeed, there are many particular aspects which make not so straightforward a 

conventional  error  analysis  of  EXAFS  data  processing.  To  list  just  the  most  obvious 

ones, there is first the effect of preliminary processing steps such as pre-edge and post-

edge background removal, which heavily rely on empirical models, and on some amount 

of  subjective  evaluation.  Another  source  of  error  is  possibly  related  to  the  frequent 

practice of combining k-space fit with Fourier-space analysis and windowing, and also 

to the need of introducing some threshold value above which the coordination shells are 

not  taken  into  account.  Finally,  different  k-space  weighting  schemes  are  typically 

2 

 

applied not only for the purpose of data presentation and inspection, but are also used in 

data  processing,  a  practice  which  does  not  seem  based  on  sound  principles.  Other 

difficulties,  which  are  indeed    typical  of  many  full-spectrum  structure-based  data  fit 

procedures,  are  due  to  the  strong  non-linear  relation  between  experimental  data  and 

model parameters, and to the high degree of correlation between model parameters. This 

can reasonably produce bias and non-parabolic errors. 

The approach that is used in this paper has been applied two years ago by the same 

group to the problem of accuracy and reliability of powder pattern structure refinement 

[Dapiaggi  et  al.  1998].  Only  the  most  general  ideas  and  the  specific  details  will  be 

discussed here, while reference is made to the previous work for a deeper discussion of 

the method. 

In general, aim of the approach is to know what amount of information is actually 

contained in an EXAFS spectrum and can be easily retrieved by routine work and, on 

the  contrary,  what  information  is  deeply  masked  by  noise  (and  by  the  particular 

structural  model)  and  therefore  requires  a  specialised  strategy  in  data  acquisition  and 

analysis, or cannot be retrieved by whatever kind of data treatment. 

This task is achieved, as suggested in the well known book by Press et al. (1988), 

with computer simulated experiments. According to this approach, a ‘large’  number of 

synthetic  data  sets  is  prepared:  each  set  of  data  differs  from  the  others  because  of 

random  errors  added  by  computer  simulation  (according  to  assumed  statistical 

distribution  laws)  to  the  same  reference  spectrum  built  from  an  assumed  structural 

model  and  assumed  (‘true’)  parameters.  Fitting  all  data  sets  to  the  model  gives  a 

population  of  parameters,  and  the  frequency  distribution  over  the  computer  generated  

population is used as a numerical sampling of the underlying probability distribution.

2. Outline 

As  a  general  rule,  we  kept  things  as  simple  as  possible.  Consequently,  some 

problems of a real EXAFS local structure determination have not been investigated in 

this preliminary approach. To quote just two well-known problems, we have considered 

only very simple models containing a single coordination shell, and we kept simple both 

the  pre-edge  and  post-edge  backgrounds.  Broadly  speaking,  the  present  paper 

investigates only the effect of random noise. 

2.1. Reference XAS spectra 

The reference spectra have been deterministically produced from assumed models 

and  from  a  given  set  of  ‘true’  parameters.  Two  different  models  are  discussed  in  the 

present work. In the first one, the photoabsorber (Ag) is surrounded by a small number 

(two) of light neighbours (O), in the second one the same photoabsorber is surrounded 

by  a  larger  number  (six)  of  heavy  neighbours  (I).  As  stated  before,  an  unique  shell 

around the photoabsorber is considered in both models. 

The GNXAS package (Filipponi, DiCicco & Natoli 1995, Filipponi & Di Cicco 

1995) has been used to calculate the reference EXAFS of both models. The reference 

XAS spectrum was built using a Debye-Waller factor equal to exp(-2·a2·k2), with a2 = 

0.01Å2 and adding: a) a pre-edge background modelled with a straight line, b) an edge 

step  modelled  with  an  arctg  function  broadened  for  the  finite  core-hole  lifetime 

corresponding to a FWHM of 8.123 eV and with an edge jump set to J = 1 and centred 

at E0=25516.5 eV; c) a post edge background modelled using the linearized hydrogenic 

model  for  the  atomic  background  absorption:  J·(1-8v/3)  with  v  =  (E-E0)/E0.  The 

4 

 

presence  of  XANES  structures  on  and  near  the  edge  was  deliberately  ignored  for  the 

sake of simplicity. Each reference XAS spectrum so obtained will be referred to in the 

following as muref(E). 

2.2. Synthetic ‘experimental’  spectra 

Starting from each reference spectrum, a set of 50 noisy spectra were simulated 

using a random number generator for adding to each point of the reference spectrum a 

Gaussian  noise  in  the  range  muref(E)(1+/-10-4)  as  an  approximation  of  a  Poissonian 

noise for a counting rate of 108 counts/s. We assume that this is a realistic noise level for 

a  “good”  experimental  spectrum  that  can  be  routinely obtained  at  a  third  generation 

synchrotron radiation source. 

2.3. Fitting procedure 

Each synthetic XAS spectrum has been fitted using again the GNXAS package. In 

particular,  the  program  performs  the  following  preliminary  operations  (not  repeated 

successively): 

1) linear fit of the pre-edge region; 

2) calculation of the first derivative of the absorption signal and determination of 

the edge position from the maximum; 

3) preliminary post edge background extraction, fitting the post edge signal with 

beta-splines and  without considering the structural parameters. 

The  program  then  compares  the  post  edge  absorption  with  a  model  which  is 

composed  by  a  smooth  post-edge  background  part  (beta-splines)  plus  a  structural 

oscillating part which is actually the EXAFS.  

5 

2.4. Evaluation of structural parameters 

 

A total number of twenty four different sets of fit parameters have been produced 

in correspondence to each different combination concerning: 

1.  Kind of model (AgO2 or AgI6), 

2.  Freely adjustable parameters: a) n (coordination number), a2 (Gaussian 

part of the Debye-Waller factor), r (shell radius), E0,T (k-space origin), 

with J (edge jump) fixed at its theoretical value of 1, or b) the previous 

set of adjustable parameters and J. 

3.  Sampling range in k space: a) 2 – 12 Å-1, or b) 3.5 – 12 Å-1, or c) 5 – 12 

Å-1, for the AgO2 model; a) 2 – 16 Å-1, or b) 3.5 – 16 Å-1, or c) 5 – 16 

Å-1, for the AgI6 model. 

4.  Weighting exponent in k space: a) fit of chi (k) [which should be the 

correct  choice  in  the  case  of  a  constant  noise],  or  b)  fit  of  k3.chi(k) 

[which  corresponds  to  what  is  more  usually  made  in  the  EXAFS 

community]; i.e. fit of km. chi (k) with m = 0 (case a) or m = 3 (case b). 

In the followings, a fit according for a particular case among all these options will 

be  concisely  referenced,  for  instance,  with  “J/2-12/3”  to  indicate  that  the  pertinent 

model  is  fitted  including  the  edge  jump  among  the  freely  adjustable  parameters, 

sampling the k space between 2 and 12 Å-1, and using m = 3 weights, or with “J=1/5-

16/0”  to  indicate  that  the  pertinent  model  is  fitted  without  including  the  edge  jump 

among the freely adjustable parameters, sampling the k space between 5 and 16 Å-1, and 

using m = 0 weights.

3. Results and discussion 

We start our discussion with the AgI6 model. For this model, the upper part of Fig. 

1  gives  an  example  of  a  single  simulated  EXAFS  (dots)  and  its  fit  (continuous  line) 

obtained with the J/2-16/3 procedure. The corresponding Fourier transforms are shown 

in the lower part of the same figure. 

By considering the whole set of 50 simulated EXAFS and the same procedure, one 

obtains  a  population  of  50  {J,  r,  n,  E0T,  a2}  or  {r,  n,  E0T,  a2}  parameters.  From  this 

population,  several  statistical  estimators  (mean  values,  standard  deviations,  …)  are 

obtained. 

Table 1 summarises the results concerning mean values and standard deviations 

for the J/2-16/3 fit procedure. It might be interesting to note that all parameters (with the 

notable exception of E0,T) are biased by amounts that are much larger than the sample 

standard deviations. The bias, however, is around 6% for the coordination number, well 

below 0.01 Å for the coordination distance, and below 2% for the Debye-Waller factor. 

All these biases are nicely smaller than what is usually believed to be a typical EXAFS 

error on these parameters. Moreover, the bias is around 10% for the edge jump. 

Deeper insights can be obtained by exploring the scatter plots (Fig. 2-6) where the 

values of couples of parameters obtained from the fit of a particular reference model and 

according to a fixed fit strategy (again: J/2-16/3) are plotted against each other for the 

whole set of simulated experiments. These figures show, for instance, that edge jump 

and Debye-Waller factor appear as only weakly correlated variables (fig. 2), while edge 

jump and coordination number are much more heavily correlated to each other (see Fig. 

3).  Concerning  the  latter  couple,  it  is  also  interesting  to  note  that  the  fit  results  are 

heavily displaced on the scatter plot from the ‘true’  values and that their joint correlation 

7 

 

line, when extrapolated to J = 1, gives a much more accurate n value. This suggests that 

taking  the  edge  jump  as  a  fixed  parameter  produces  a  much  better  value  for  the 

coordination number. 

Fig.  7-  11  compare  mean  values  and  standard  errors  for  different  fit  procedures 

and  for  the  simulated  experiments  on  AgI6.  On  these  plots,  the  error  bars  are  the 

standard errors calculated over the sample of computer simulated experiments, and the 

horizontal lines are the true values. The x axis is simply a label of the fit procedure and 

the  correspondence  is  as  follows:  1:  J=1/2-16/3;  2:  J=1/3.5-16/3;  3:  J=1/5-16/3;  4: 

J=1/2-16/0; 5: J=1/3.5-16/0; 6: J=1/5-16/0; 7: J/2-16/3; 8: J/3.5-16/3; 9: J/5-16/3; 10: 

J/2-16/0 11: J/3.5-16/0; 12: J/5-16/0. 

In some detail, Figs. 7 and 8 show the results obtained for J and n. When J is fixed 

to its true value (x-labels 1 to 6), the coordination numbers obtained are quite close to 

the  real  value,  with  a  bias  that  is  close  to  the  statistical  error  and  well  below  20  % 

(which  is  commonly  believed  to  be  a  good  estimate  of  the  error  in  the  coordination 

numbers  as  determined  by  EXAFS).  In  addition,  the  statistical  error  is  almost 

independent on the weighting scheme and on the range of k space used in the fit. On the 

contrary,  allowing  J  to  float  (cases  7  -  12)  introduces  a  bias  in  the  determination  of 

coordination numbers which is much greater than the statistical spread (but in any case 

below 20 %).  

The correlation between n and J is well known and is due to the fact that they both 

contribute to the EXAFS as normalising factors. In particular, it is well apparent from 

Figs.  7  and  8  that,  when  J  is  allowed  to  float,  the  n  values  obtained  from  the  fit  are 

almost  always  greater  than  the  true  value,  while  the  J  values  are  always  lower. 

Moreover,  J·n  (which  is  the  actual  normalizing  factor  of  the  EXAFS)  is  regularly 

underestimated  (from  the  mean  values  of  Table  1,  <J·n>  =  5.85  instead  of  6).  In  our 

8 

 

opinion, this last fact is due to broadening of the edge caused by the finite lifetime of the 

core  hole.  The  broadened  edge  jump  is  then  accounted  by  the  beta-splines  used  for 

fitting the post-edge background in form of a lower trend of the average signal just after 

the edge. Then, the extrapolation to the edge energy of this ‘wrong’  trend produces an 

underestimation of J (and J·n) which is calculated as the difference between post-edge 

and pre-edge backgrounds at the edge. An indirect proof of the above understanding has 

been obtained by considering a restricted number of simulated experiment based on a 

reference EXAFS with a stepped edge jump (instead of the rounded arctg shape). In this 

case, the fit gives much more accurate parameters: <J> = 0.98, <n> = 6.07 and <J·n> = 

5.95. 

The  a2 parameter (see Fig. 9) is almost independent on the actual fit conditions 

and is always quite well determined, both the bias and the statistical error being of the 

order of few percents. This despite the fact that there are correlations of a2 both with J 

and  n.  Seemingly,  what  is  important  here  is  the  total  correlation  of  all  the  three 

parameters  a2,  J  and  n;  J  and  n  may  well  be  heavily  biased,  but  their  combination  is 

accurate enough to allow an accurate determination of a2. 

The  E0T  parameter  is  seemingly  well  recovered  (Fig.  10)  for  all  fit  procedures. 

Concerning the r parameter (Fig. 11), the bias is well above the statistical error. E0T and 

r are strongly correlated, but this correlation is not enough to explain the bias on r. We 

think  that  this  is  (at  least  partially)  an  indirect  effect  of  the  disorder  (a2),  because  in 

calculating the mean geometrical configuration the fitting program uses other factors in 

addition  to  the  simple  Debye-Waller  weight  coming  from  the a2 factor: this produces 

small  phase  and  amplitude  shifts  which  possibly  are  at  the  origin  of  the  bias 

experimentally observed.  Of course, this second order effect is expected to vanish in the 

limit  a2  ->  0.  Indeed,  using  a  reference  model  with  a  ten  times  lower  a2  we  actually 

9 

 

obtained a six times lower bias on r. It should be noted, however, that the (systematic) 

error affecting r is of the order of a few thousandths of Å, that is well below the value 

(1-2 hundredths of Å) which is usually assumed as a reasonable estimate of the error in 

the determination of the bond distances by EXAFS. 

Finally,  for  what  concerns  more  generally  the  correlations  between  different 

parameters, it can be said that the case of the J/2-16/3 procedure is well representative 

of the results for the different procedures. 

The  results  for  the  AgO2  model  are  shown  in  Fig.s  12-16.  The  results  for  this 

model are qualitatively similar to those of the AgI6 model, but in general correlations, 

biases  and  the  statistical  errors  are  greater.  For  example,  the  systematic  error  which 

affects r can be of the order of 1-2 hundredths of Å, and that which affects n can reach 

the value of 20 % if J is allowed to float. This result is expected and is due to the much 

lower level of the EXAFS oscillations for this model.

4. Conclusions 

The most important result of the present simulation approach is that random noise 

plays a minor role with respect to systematic errors in determining accuracy, precision 

and  correlation  of  the  structural  parameters  obtained  from  analysis  of  an  EXAFS 

spectrum.  This  inference  is  well  apparent  when  one  considers,  on  one  side,  that  the 

simulated  experiments  only  account  for  random  noise  and,  on  the  other  side,  that  for 

most parameters the statistical spread here obtained is typically much lower than what is 

reported  in  the  scientific  literature  as  the  typical  error  of  a  real  EXAFS  analysis.  The 

conclusion  is  also  supported  by  the  simulation  results  alone,  by  considering  the 

significant difference (for some parameters) between bias and statistical spread. 

If  we  now  remind  that  the  background  is  here  modelled  only  in  a  drastically 

simplified way, while a real EXAFS spectrum is much more difficult to analyse on this 

regard,  it  seems  reasonable  to  infer  that  the  most  important  source  of  error  in  the 

analysis  of  an  EXAFS  spectrum  is  related  to  the  procedure  of  (pre-edge  and/or  post-

edge) background subtraction. On this regard, the computer simulation also makes clear 

the  importance  of  the  a  priori  knowledge  of  the  correct  value  of  the  edge  jump  (J), 

which is essential for an accurate determination of n. It is therefore suggested to start an 

EXAFS  analysis  only  after  having  obtained  an  independent  and  reasonably  accurate 

value of the edge jump, for instance by comparison with the spectra of proper standards 

of precisely known coordination number or, more directly, by accurately determining the 

amount of photo-absorber atoms in the sample. 

Finally,  the  present  simulation  approach  show  that  the  accuracy  of  the  fitted 

parameters  is  practically  independent  both  of  the  weighting  scheme  and  of  the  fitted 

range in k space. The latter aspect practically affects only the determination of a correct 

11 

 

value of J if – contrary to the suggested procedure – one wants to keep this parameter 

free to change during fitting.

Fig.  7- Edge jump J as determined from the different fitting procedures (x-labels, see 

text), for the AgI6 model. The horizontal line marks the true value, and the error bars are 

the  statistical  errors  calculated  over  the  sample  of  50  synthetic  experiments.  The  J 

parameter has been kept fixed at its true value  = 1 in the first six fitting procedures.

Abstract 

The coaxial wire method provides an experimental way 
of  measuring  wake  fields  without  the  need  for  a  particle 
beam.  A  special  setup  has  been  designed  and  is  in  the 
process  of  being  fabricated  at  SLAC  to  measure  the  loss 
factors  and  synchronous  frequencies  of  dipole  modes  in 
both  traveling  and  standing  wave  structures  for  the  Next 
Linear  Collider  (NLC).  The  method  is  described  and 
predictions based on electromagnetic field simulations are 
discussed. 

1 INTRODUCTION 
If left undisturbed, the wake fields excited by bunches of 
highly  energetic  charged  particle  beams  interact  with 
trailing  bunches  and  can  lead  to  a  significant  dilution  of 
the beam emittance. Provided the wakefield is sufficiently 
strong,  it  can  cause  a  Beam  Break  Up  (BBU)  instability 
making  the  collider  unusable.  The  final  center  of  mass 
energy of the beam  for the NLC is 500 GeV (in the first 
stage of operation) and should the beam become unstable 
and come into contact with the metallic structure it would 
readily  vaporize  the  metal.  This  makes  it  crucially 
important  to  understand  and  minimize  the  wakefield  in 
the design of linear colliders. 

Transverse  wake  fields,  for  both  the  first  dipole  band 
and  higher  order  bands,  have  been  carefully  measured  at 
the  ASSET  facility  in  the  SLC  [1]  for  several  DDS 
accelerators.    In  that  experiment,  the  wakefields  excited 
by  a  bunch  were  sampled  with  a  subsequent  witness 
bunch.  Also,  the  fields  radiating  out  from  the  manifolds 
were  sampled  and  information  on  the  modal  content  and 
beam position was obtained via coaxial pickups.  

In this paper a wire method is described. The advantage 
of this method lies in the fact that it does not require the 
use  of  particle  beams  [2]  to  measure  the  wakefield.  A 
microwave  measurement  in  the  laboratory  allows  the 
wakefield  to  be  measured  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  In 
essence,  the  method  relies  on  being  able  to  simulate  a 
beam passing through the structure by using a microwave 
signal  traveling  on  a  wire  placed  at  varying  offsets  from 
the  electrical  center  of  the  structure.  This  microwave 
signal excites a  whole range  of higher order modes. One 
can measure either the distortion of a current pulse at the 
the 
exit  of 

time  domain  [2],  or

Such  measurements  have  been  routinely  used  for 
determining the impedance of accelerating structures and 
other  components  [5,6,7].  Either  an  on-axis  wire  for 
longitudinal 
placed 
symmetrically around the axis for transverse impedances, 
have been used [8].  The measurement is more difficult to 
perform  for  the  NLC  X-band  structures,  compared  to 
some  earlier  lower  frequency  measurements,  because  of 
rather tight tolerances imposed on component  fabrication 
by  an  accelerator  operating  at  a  fundamental  mode  of 
frequency  of  11.424GHz.  Special  attention  has  also  to 
been  paid  to  the  alignment  of  components  in  the 
measurement setup. 

2 EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
For the NLC structures, frequency domain measurements 
will be performed first. We are primarily interested in the 
kick  factors  of  the  dipole  passbands  that  give  the  main 
contribution to the wake fields [9]. In order to excite and 
measure such fields, we need either an offset wire, or two 
wires.  Initially, we will use a single wire. A discussion of 
these two options is given in [10]. 

The measurement setup is shown in Fig. 1. With the aid 
of  a  network  analyzer  the  transmission  parameter  S21  is 
measured through the structure, which will be referred to 
as a device under test (DUT). The matching sections were 
carefully designed  such that signal losses are  minimized. 
In order to connect the wire relatively easily, we chose to 
use  coaxial  towaveguide  adapters,  as  shown  in  Fig.  2. 
Such  adapters  are  characterized  by  a  broad  frequency 
bandwidth,  enabling  us  to  measure  one  or  possibly  two 
pass-bands  in  each  experiment.  The  first  adapter  (left  in

one  was designed to accommodate the  wire and to adapt 
the inner conductor of the coaxial  waveguide to the  wire 
diameter.  The  wire  diameter  was  chosen  0.25  mm.  For 
thinner wires the losses of the coaxial waveguide increase, 
while for thicker wires the perturbation of the fields in the 
structure is higher. The adapter used for the lowest dipole 
bands of the accelerating structures has a frequency range 
from 11 to 18 GHz. It suppresses the reflected RF signal 
below approximately 30 dB. The wire can be transversely 
moved  with  respect  to  the  axis  by  slightly  bending  the 
tubes of the  matching sections. This solution  was chosen 
to avoid RF discontinuities in the setup.

3 SIMULATIONS 
In  order  to  understand  the  changes  induced  by  the 
presence  of  the  wire,  an  analysis  of  an  accelerating 
structure  has  been  made.  We  used  the  finite  element 
electromagnetic  field  simulator  HFSS  to  simulate  the 
fields in the structure and to calculate the resonant modes. 
The detuned accelerating structure DS2 [11] was used for 
initial  studies  because  it  has  an  adequate  frequency 
separation of modes and is readily available for testing in 
the wire measurement set up. Simulations have been made 
for  a  downstream  cell  of  this  structure,  with  periodic 
boundary  conditions  and  work  is  under  way  to  simulate 
the progress of a pulse through the DUT. 

3.1 Dispersion diagram 

Fig.  3  shows  the  dispersion  diagram  obtained  for  cell 
198  of  DS2.  The  dashed  lines  with  empty  symbols 
represent passbands and modes for the unperturbed cell. A 
quarter of cell was simulated (see Fig. 4-a) for two cases: 
with  magnetic  boundary  conditions  in  both  symmetry 
planes  and  with  electric  boundary  in  one  plane  and 
magnetic  in  the  other.  The  walls  are  perfect  conducting. 
The solid lines  with solid symbols in  Fig. 3 are obtained 
for a perfect conducting  wire 250 µm in diameter placed 
at 1 mm distance from the axis and parallel to it. Half of a 
cell  was  simulated  (Fig.  4-b)  with  magnetic  boundary 
conditions.  The  first  three  dipole  bands  are  included,  as

the light velocity line, and the first monopole band around 
12  GHz  and  130º  phase  advance,  and  between  the  first 
dipole  band  and  the  monopole  band  around  16  GHz  and

dipole modes is the shift in frequency. It converges to the 
frequency  of  the  unperturbed  mode  when  the  wire 
approaches the center of the cell. 

 

3.2 Kick factors 

The  loss  factor  for  the  cell  with  wire  is  obtained  as 
usual from integrating the longitudinal electric field along 
a path parallel to the axis. For dipole modes, the field has 
a term proportional to the radial coordinate, r, (measured 
with respect to the  wire position) as in the case  when  no 
wire is present in the cell, plus a term proportional to 1/r. 
The  second  term  dominates  for  small  offsets,  and  it 
becomes  negligible  for  larger  offsets.  This  entitles  us  to 
define a kick  factor as in the case of a cell  without  wire, 
by  normalizing  the  loss  factor  to  the  offset  of  the  path 
where the electric field is integrated:

where c is the velocity of light, ω the angular frequency of 
the  mode,  lcell  the  cell  length,  x  is  the  offset  of  the 
integration  path  considered  in  the  plane  containing  the 
wire,  xw  the  offset  of  the  wire  and  k||  the  loss  factor 
calculated along the path at offset x. 

Fig. 5 shows the kick factor for the first dipole mode for 
a wire placed at 1 mm offset from the axis as a function of 
the offset of the integration path with respect to the wire. 
The  kick  factor  for  the  case  without  a  wire  is  shown  as 
well.  For  large  offsets  with  respect  to  the  wire,  the  kick 
factor  is  constant.  The  asymmetry  between  positive  and 
negative offsets is a result of the asymmetry in the fields.

Figure  5  Kick  factor  for  the  first  synchronous  dipole
mode of cell 198 with a wire 250 µm in diameter, placed
at 1 mm offset 

The change in the dipole mode kick factor with the wire 
offset  is  illustrated  in  Fig.  6.  As  the  wire  approaches  the 
center of the cell, the kick factor becomes equal to the one 
of  the  unperturbed  cell  (marked  by  the  horizontal  lines). 
In  practice  one  cannot  excite  the  dipole  modes  with  a 
centered  wire,  but  one  can  deduce  the  synchronous 
frequency and kick factor of the mode by measuring with 
several wire offsets and extrapolating to centered wire. 

4 SUMMARY 
In  this  paper  we  have  described  the  experimental  setup 
and  the  fundamental  physics  that  lie  behind  the  wire 
measurements  which  will  be  used  to  measure  wakefields 
in  the  NLC  accelerating  structures.  The  experiment  has 
been  designed  to  minimize  transmission  losses  in  the 
transverse

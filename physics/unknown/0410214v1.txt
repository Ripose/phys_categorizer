Abstract 

The investigations of powerful discharge in high density hydrogen were carried out on an installation with 
preliminary  adiabatic  compression.  The  experiments  were  performed  under  the  following  conditions:  stored 
energy of the capacitive storage – 140-450 kJ, charging voltage – 8.0-14.0 kV, discharge current amplitude– 200-
600 kA, current rise rate – 109-1010 A/s. The maximum particle density nmax, achieved just before the discharge, 
was about 2.0·1022 cm-3. It was observed one or several compression of the discharge channel. The moments of 
contractions corresponds a increase of voltage on discharge gap and feature on a curve of a current. 

Arc parameters were calculated on the basis of the channel model. It was established that increase of the 
initial density of particles at increase of a current rate of rise results in reduction of arc diameter with increase of 
channel temperature. 

The  results  of  investigations  of  powerpulse  electric  discharge  in  hydrogen  with  preliminary 

adiabatic compression at current amplitude (1–2)·105 A are presented in [1, 2].

Modernization of experimental installation resulted on increasing current rate of rise from 109 
A/s to 1010 A/s. Current amplitude was driven to 5·105 A. The diagram of a new discharge chamber 
design  is  presented  on  fig.  1.  The  construction  of  a  diagnostic  window  3  mm  diameter,  made  of 
high  impact  strength  organic,  was  designed  for  optical  measurements.  It  was  permited  to  get 
photostreak of discharge channel and its photo. 

Experimental results 

The  discharge  was  initiated  after  the  adiabatic  compression  up  to  100–180  MPa  in  the 
discharge chamber just before the discharge. It was corresponded to maximal hydrogen molecules 
concentration above 1022 cm–3. Oscillogram of pressure in the discharge chamber is showed in fig. 
2.  

The dynamic volt–ampere character is changed at current amplitude increasing up to 5·105 A 
at increasing its rate of rise. Oscillograms for the electric current and voltage in the discharge gap 
are presented in fig. 3 for different current rate of rise. It was found that the strength of field and 
near  electrode  voltage  drop  values  increase  with  initial  gas  density  [1,  2]  and  with  increasing  of 
current  rate  of  rise  (fig.  4,  5).  The  values  of  near  electrode  voltage  drop  were  obtained  from 
extrapolation interelectrode gap length on zero.

In fig. 6a photostreak of the discharge channel was made at initial hydrogen pressure 5 MPa 
without preliminary adiabatic compression. Fig. 6b corresponds to the preliminary compression to 
110 MPa. In the first case the maximal channel contraction was observed to radius ≤ 0.8 mm. In the 
second  case  the  minimal  radius  1.9  mm,  which  corresponds  to  weak  glow  in  the  photostreak. 

 

 

 

 

 

Increasing  in  arc  voltage  and  dropping  (or  feature)  in  the  discharge  current  corresponds  to  the 
moment  of  channel  contraction.  It  ought  to  be  mentioned  that  sometimes  several  channel 
contractions or one but more strong are observed according to the voltage oscillograms (fig. 7, 8). 
Usually  time  from  the  discharge  initiation  to  channel  contraction  increases  at  increasing  of 
hydrogen  initial  particle  density  before  the  discharge.  Channel  contraction  can  take  place  both 
before and after current maximum. At the moment of maximum channel contraction the intensity of 
radiation in visible part of spectrum decreases sharply

Discussion 

The discharge channel parameters were estimated in two extreme cases: the discharge burns 
in  pure  hydrogen  (initial  concentration  of  hydrogen  is  ~1022  cm–3)  and  discharge  burn  in  metal 
vapour of initiating wire. 

In the first case the radiation in the channel is . Plasma is transparent. The system of equations

Conclusion 

here T – channel temperature, ni – ion concentration, r0 – channel radius, σ – conductivity, P – 

pressure after adiabatic compression, I – current, E – strength of field.  

 
Values P, I and E, systems necessary for the system decision, are took from oscillograms at 
the  moment  of  time  corresponding  to  the  maximal  contraction.  Calculated  values  of  conductivity 
for  hydrogen  and  metal  plasma  took  from  works  [3]  and  [4]  accordingly.  The  system  of  the 
equations was solved for two values of strength of a field. At more frequently repeating value E = 
1600  V/sm  to  the  appropriate  average  contractions  (fig.  5)  and  at  maximal  contraction  E  =  3600 
V/cm. Thus in both cases J = 400 kA and P = 300 MPa. The system decision for the first case  

E = 1600 V/cm: T = 3·105 K, n0 = 3.4·1020 cm-3, r = 0.1 cm 
E = 3600 V/cm: T = 3·105 K, n0 = 1.0·1021 cm-3, r = 0.06 cm 
Accuracy of the system decision is ~10 %. 
It is visible, that to deeper contraction there corresponds the higher density and smaller radius 

of the channel. Thus the total number of particles in the channel is remained. 

In that case if the discharge burns in metal vapour, then the optical density of the channel is 

great. Therefore it was considered, that it radiates as black body. 

In the second case the optical density of the channel is high. Therefore it was considered that 

it radiates as a black body. 

In this case from the system:  

We receive result r0 = 0.2 cm, T = 1.25.105 K, n0 = 1020 cm–3. 
 

Estimations  show  that  experiment  corresponding  conditions  in  fig.  5a  is  more  suitable  to 
burning  arc  in  hydrogen.  The  condition  in  fig.  5b  closely  corresponds  to  arc  burning  in initiating 
wire  vapour,  its  radius  of  expansion  on  this  condition  is  0.2  cm  according  to  independent 
estimations and close to measured channel radius. 

Field strength and near electrode voltage drops are increased with current rise rate and initial

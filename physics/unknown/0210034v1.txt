A new type of antenna, which we have called Ferromagnetic Antenna, has been considered
for Generation   and   Detection   of   Gravitational   Radiation. A simple experiment, in which
gravitational radiation at 10 GHz can be emitted and received in laboratory, is presented.

          Several  experiments1-6,  have

deduced here. Then  we will show  that
the gravitational mass can be changed
by  means  of  Extreme-Low  Frequency

experiments,  using  appropriated    ELF
radiation,  has  been  carried  out  to  test
experimentally 
this  equation.  The
experimental  results  are  in  agreement
with the theoretical predictions. On the
other  hand,  the  detection  of  negative

          We  have  concluded  from  the
experiments

emitted  from  ferromagnetic  materials

electromagnetic radiation.

Therefore, from  the  Fig.1  we  conclude
that    the  iron  sphere  will    absorb
practically all radiation emitted from the
dipole.  Indeed,  the  sphere  has  been
designed    with  this  purpose,  and  in
such  a  manner  that  all  their  atoms
should be reached  by the radiation. In
this  way,  the  radiation  outside  of  the

time 

          When the gravitational field of an
object  changes,  the  changes  ripple
outwards  through  space  and  take  a
finite 
to  reach  other  objects.
These  ripples  are  called  gravitational
radiation  or gravitational waves .
          The  existence  of  gravitational
waves follows from the General Theory
of  Relativity.  In  Einstein's  theory  of
gravity 
gravitational  waves
propagate  at the speed of light.
          Just  as  electromagnetic  waves
(EM),  gravitational  waves  (GW)  too
carry energy and momentum from their
sources.  Unlike  EM  waves,  however,
there is no dipole radiation in Einstein's
theory  of  gravity.  The  dominant
channel  of  emission  is  quadrupolar.

          As  concerns  detection  of    the
gravitational  radiation    from      dipole,
there  are  many  options.    A  similar
gravitational  dipole  can  also  absorb
energy  from  an  incident  gravitational
wave. If a gravitational wave is incident
on  the  gravitational  dipole(receiver)  in
Fig.2(b)  the  masses  of  the  "heavy"
electrons will be driven into  oscillation.
The  amplitude  of  the  oscillations    will
be the same of the  emitter, i.e., 1.5cm,
and  there  will  be  an  induced  electric
current    I  '    through  the  ferromagnetic
antenna of the receiver (see Fig.2(b)).
          The  weakness  with  which
gravitational waves interact with matter
is  well-known.  There  is  no  significant
scattering  or  absorption.  It  means  that
gravitational  waves  carry  uncorrupted
information even if they come from the
most  distant  parts  of  the  Universe.
Consequently  ,  a  gravitational  waves
transceiver,  based  on  the  experiment
presented  in  Fig.2,  would  allow  us  to
communicate through the Earth, which,
like  all  matter  of  the  Universe,  is
transparent 
to  gravitational  waves.
Furthermore,  the  receiver  would  allow
us  to  directly  observe  for  the  first  time
the  Cosmic  Microwave  Background  in
Gravitational  Radiation,  which  would
picture 
the
beginning of the Big Bang.

Abstract 
       We  demonstrate  the  role  played  by  the  fullerenes  shell  in  the  photoionization  and  vacancy 
decay of endohedral atoms 
. It is shown, partly in the frame of a rather simple model that 
describes the fullerene shell, partly using only the assumption on the smallness of the atom A in

comparison to the size of C60 that it affects photoionization and the vacancy  decay of 
 
profoundly. Namely, it leads to a number of new resonances in photoionization cross-section and 
other  photoionization  characteristics  as  well  as  strong  modifications  of  the  vacancy  decay 
probabilities and opening of new decay channels.  
       We will discuss the problem of photon propagation through the C60 shell and conclude that at 
any considered frequency ω, 
 the C60 enhances the incoming radiation. This shows 
≤
non-metallic dielectric behavior of the 240 collectivized electrons in C60.  
       We discuss also the C60 effects upon the fast electron inelastic scattering.  
       The results obtained are valid qualitatively also for other than C60, e.g. for C70 or C76.

Introductory remarks 

       During last decade new atom-like objects consisting of many carbon atoms forming a closed 
almost  “empty”  and  two-dimensional  surface,  so-called  fullerenes,  were  discovered.  A  lot  of 
attention  was  given  to  investigation  of  their  structure  using  photoabsorption  and  electron 
scattering  data.  It  appeared  that  all  but  the  1s2  electrons  of  carbon  atoms  are  to  large  extent 
collectivized. As a result, the photoabsorption spectrum of these objects, just as of atomic nuclei 
and some multi-electron atoms is characterized by a prominent maximum called Giant resonance 
(see  [1,  2]  and  references  therein).  The  integrated  power  of  this  resonance,  its  total  oscillator 
strength, is close to the total number of electrons (or nucleons) in the system under consideration. 
Although  fullerenes  are  tough  objects  for  ab  initio  theoretical  calculations,  a  number  of 
theoretical approaches were developed to investigate them. Inevitably, they are based on different 
approximating assumptions. 
       It appeared that fullerenes have a  rather specific and unusual feature: almost any atom can 
from  the  periodic  table  can  be  located  inside  fullerene,  thus  leading  to  so-called  endohedral 
atoms.  In  fact,  not  only  one,  but  several  atoms  can  be  located  inside  a  fullerene,  particularly 
inside  a  structure  that  consists  of  sixty  or  even  more  carbon  atoms.  These  objects  are  in  fact 
micro  getero-structures,  and  as  such  deserve  particular  attention.  Indeed,  the  properties  of  the 
inner  atom,  for  instance  its  photoionization  cross-sections  and  created  in  such  process  vacancy 
decay is strongly affected by the surrounding fullerene shell. The opposite is also valid and the 
fullerene is affected by attraction from the atom located inside.  
       The  aim  of  this  paper  is  to  demonstrate  how  the  photoionization  cross  section  and  the 
 is altered 
probability of the subsequent vacancy decay of most studied endohedral atoms 
60C .  The  results  will  be  obtained  either  using  a  very  simple 
due  to  the  action  of  the  fullerene 
model, or on the base of existing experimental data.

 is used in this paper. 

       In this paper we will present two types of effects upon the photoionization cross-section of 
the atom located inside the fullerene shell: the reflection of the photoelectron wave by the static 
field  of  fullerene  shell  and  incoming  photon  modification  due  to  dynamic  response  of  the 
collectivized  electrons  of  the  fullerene.  Some  attention  will  be  given  to  investigation  of 
conducting properties of C60. Then we will discuss the modification by C60 shell of the decay of 
the vacancies created in photoionization of the atom A. We will also investigate the effect of C60 
shell upon the two-electron photoionization of the He atom, located inside the fullerene shell. The 
inelastic scattering of the photoelectron with the fullerenes shell will be ignored. 
       Thus, we will investigate processes that, although in some cases having relatively small cross 
sections and probabilities, are distinguishable from other in electron-spectroscopy or coincidental 
experiments.  The  inelastic  scattering  of  photoelectrons  from  the  inner  atom  A  by  the  fullerene 
shell  and “closing” of the inner atom vacancies  by fullerene  electron  are not considered in this 
paper

       2. Confinement resonances  
       For concreteness, let us concentrate on only one type of a fullerene, namely C60. Assume for 
simplicity  that  the  atom  A  is  located  at  the  center  of  almost  spherically  -  symmetric  C60  shell.  
Static action of C60 shell is schematically presented in Fig. 1. Note that the action of the fullerene 
shell upon the photoelectron wave leads to its interference of direct and reflected waves as it is 
shown in Fig. 1 (see [3] and references therein).

       Since  the  thickness  of  the  C60  shell  ∆   is  much  smaller  than  its  radius  R,  for  low-energy 
photoelectrons one can substitute the C60 potential by a zero-thickness pseudo-potential [4, 5]:

       Non-dipole parameters are represented by expressions considerably more complex than (6).

IV.   Intershell interaction and interference resonances 
       In  this  section  we  will  concentrate  on  the  dynamic  reaction  of  C60  shell  upon  the 
photoionization  of  the  inner  atom  A.  In  the  derivation  we  will  follow  the  analogy  between  an 
ordinary atomic multi-electron subshell and shell of 240 collectivized electrons of C60.  
       It  has  been  already  more  than  thirty  years  since  it  was  predicted  that  intra-  and  inter-shell 
interactions in atoms could modify considerably the partial photoabsorption cross-sections. It was 
demonstrated that the so-called intershell interaction leads to interference resonances [11, 12].  
       From physical point of view the situation remains the same, when along with atomic shells 
the additional fullerene shell appears. The essential simplification is that the interaction between 
the  fullerene  and  atomic  A  electrons  is  sufficient  to  take  into  account  in  the  first  order  of 
perturbation theory, since the radius of the fullerene R is much bigger than the atomic radius  Ar . 
As a result, one has for the main term of this interaction only a dipole-dipole contribution:

relation is parametrically justified for atoms, which ionization potential is much bigger than that 
of a fullerene. 
       In the language of the diagrammatic theory  of the many-body systems the photoabsorption 
amplitude is given by the following equation [12]: 
 
 
                                                          =                     +                                                                    (9)

      It  is  seen  that  at  low  ω  the  fullerene  is  almost  completely  suppresses  the  incident 
electromagnetic field due to polarization of C60. As a result, the photoionization cross-section of 
the  encapsulated  atom  A  becomes  considerably  suppressed.  As  is  seen,  the  situation  is  quite 
different when the photon energy is close to characteristic excitation energy of electrons of the 
fullerene  C60  itself,  mainly  to  its  Giant  resonance  that  is  located  at  20-22  eV.  A  remarkable 

 

 

example here is the Xe 5s subshell photoionization in Xe@C60. The ionization potential of this 
subshell is close to energy of the Giant Resonance of the fullerene. As shown in [14], this results 
in radical modification of the 5s subshell photoionization cross- section near the threshold.

       We  see  that  the  5s cross-section  with  the  account  of  dynamic  action  of  C60  (heavy  line)  is 
essentially modified as compared to its value that includes the action of C60 static potential only 
(dashed line). The free Xe atom 5s-electrons cross-section that is strongly affected by the action 
of 4d10 and 5p6 subshells is given by the dotted curve [11]. 
 
5. Decay of vacancies     
       It  is  natural  to  distinguish  decays  of  vacancies  in  endohedral  atoms  by  the  degree  of 
participation  of  the  fullerenes  electrons.  Namely,  the  vacancy  in  the  endohedral  atom  can  be 
occupied by an outer electron either from the same atom or from the collectivized electrons of the 
fullerene,  forming  what  could  be  called  atomic  and  fullerene  decay,  respectively.  If  atomic 
vacancy is deep enough, it can be closed be one of the non-collectivized inner electrons of carbon 
atoms that form the fullerene, presenting molecular decay.  
       Note,  that  Auger-decay  in  collisions  of  atoms  and  ions  with  transition  of  electrons  of  one 
atom  into  a  vacancy  in  another  was  suggested  about  at  least  forty  years  ago  [16].  Recently 
intermolecular  transitions  became  an  object  of  extensive  consideration  (see  [17]  and  references 
therein). 
       If the encapsulated atom vacancy decay results in emission of a photon, the fullerene shell 
can  intercept  it,  then  emitting  a  photon  with  the  same  energy.  Thus,  the  vacancy’s  decay  in  A 
occurs  through  two  channels.  The  first  one  is  the  recombination  radiation  of  a  photon  in  the 
isolated A atom. The second one is the two-step process running through the electron excitation 
of the fullerene shell. The amplitudes of these channels interfere similar to how this happens in

isolated  atoms  [18]  where  the  decay  probability  can  be  altered  dramatically  from  strong 
enhancement  till  almost  complete  suppression.  The  same  situation  can  happen  in  the  Auger 
decay:  the  interaction  between  electrons,  inner  and  outer,  can  be  modified  due  to  virtual 
excitations of C60 electrons, thus substituting the pure Coulomb inter-electron interaction V  by a 
(see  e.g.  [12]).  The  difference  between  V

similar to the case of radiative decay in isolated atoms [18]:

       Of special interest is the decay of vacancies in the subvalent s- subshells in the endohedral 
noble gas atoms. These vacancies in isolated atoms are decaying only radiative, while the Auger-
decay  is  energetically  forbidden.  However,  the  energy  emitted  in  intra-atomic  decay  of  such  a 
vacancy is sufficient to eliminate one of the collectivized electrons from the C60 shell. As a result, 
the decay probability enhances dramatically, as we will see, by four-six orders of magnitude.  
       Due  to  validity  of  the  approximation  (8),  this  Auger-decay  can  be  presented  as  a  photon 
i →  with the subsequent photoionization by this photon of the C60 shell.

Of  some  interest  is  to  estimate  whether  the  virtual  excitations  of  C60  electrons  can  modify  the 

interaction between the atomic electron that undertake transition from the level f to i and one of 
the C60 electrons. Diagrammatically, this effect is represented by (14b). As it is shown in [19], the 
respective correction leads to the second  term in the square brackets in (17):

Eq. (14) Ic is the fullerenes ionization potential. The calculation results of the real and imaginary 
parts  of  the  dynamic  polarizability  of  the  fullerene  shell  C60  are  given  in  Fig.9  [19].  The 
experimental photoabsorption cross-section for C60 taken from [2] is presented in insertion to Fig. 
10.  As  seen  from  this  figure,  the  cross-section  is  small  at  the  threshold  (which  also  means 
relatively  low  intensity  of  discrete  excitations)  and  is  dominated  by  the  Giant  Resonance  well 
above  the  threshold.  Therefore,  in  (18)  a  small  contribution  of  discrete  excitations  of  the  C60 
collectivized electrons are neglected.

7. Is C60 a metal? 
       Since we have investigated above the reaction of the collectivized electrons of C60, we can 
find out whether they behave as a metal, dielectric or in another way. In fact, we can determine a 
metal  as  a  system,  inside  of  which  the  electric  field  E  is  zero  irrespectively  to  its  magnitude 
outside of the system. So, it is natural to introduce the field modification factor [22]

consider  a  process,  in  which  one  photon  eliminates  two  electrons  just  from  the  inner  atom  in

Therefore  only  the  reflection  of  outgoing  electron  by  the  potential  (1)  has  to  be  taken  into 
account.  This  can  be  achieved  by  altering  one  or  two  outgoing  photoelectron  wave  functions 
introducing factors 

from (2).

IX. Conclusions and Perspectives 
       We  have  investigated  here  effects  of  fullerenes  shell  upon  photoionization  of  and  vacancy 
decay in endohedral atoms. We demonstrate prominent modifications of the total and differential 
in  angle  and  energy  photoionization  cross-sections  that  come  from  reflection  of  photoelectron 
waves by static C60 potential and modification of the incoming electromagnetic field due to C60   
electron shell polarization. We found strong modifications of the vacancy decay probabilities and 
investigated the role of opening of new channels. The results were expressed via experimentally 

 

21

observable characteristics of the fullerene: its electron affinity and photoabsorption cross-section, 
along with the assumption that the fullerenes radius is much bigger than that of the atom and the 
fullerenes shell is thin as compared to its radius.  
       Modification of the incoming photon beam field and vacancy decay probabilities are mainly 
due to virtual or real excitation of the C60 dipole Giant resonance. Concrete results were obtained 
for C60, but qualitatively they are valid for other fullerenes, such as e.g.  C70 or C76. One has to 
have in mined that many of the fullerenes are essentially deformed. 
       Such characteristics of endohedrals’ photoionization as non-dipole anisotropy parameters are 
not  properly  considered  in  this  paper  since  we  do  not  have  experimental  data  or  reliable 
theoretical calculations of the quadrupole excitation spectrum. This is one of the problems that is 
of interest to study using the zero-thickness model. Another task is to introduce resistance of the 
fullerenes shell against alteration of its radius and to take into account the radius variation when 
an atom is stuffed inside a fullerene.  
       We need also to develop an approach that would permit on the same level of simplicity to 
describe  inelastic  scattering  of  photoelectrons  with  the  fullerene  shell  and  the  shell’s  electron 
transitions into vacancies in endohedral atoms.  
       As soon as we will be able to treat the non-dipole excitations of the fullerenes shell and its 
resistance toward stretching, we could investigate the fast electron – endohedral atoms inelastic 
scattering  and  its  characteristics  –  Generalized  oscillator  strengths.  If  good  and  simple 
approximation  for  wave  functions  of  collectivized  electrons  in  the  frame  of  the  “orange  skin” 
model  would  be  developed,  it  becomes  possible  to  treat  accurately  enough  those  endohedral 
atoms vacancy decay, in which the vacancy in an endohedral is occupied by fullerenes electron. It 
would be possible to treat fullerenes and endohedrals multi-electron ionization with emission of 
fullerenes electrons.    
       One  has  to  have  in  mind  that  ideal  spherical  symmetry  is  a  essentially  simplifying  model: 
even  for  C60  the  octahedral  structure  adds  some  extra  terms  to  the  angular  anisotropy  of 
photoelectrons.  It  is  essential  that  due  to  high  symmetry  of  C60  corrections  of  relatively  high 
order in angular momentum of the field acting upon photoelectrons become important.

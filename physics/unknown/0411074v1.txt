one for each center) under rotation and superimposition to its mirror immage. The set of rules which 

is identified allows the classification of the new molecule, obtained by the addition of another chiral

center, by the determination of the selection rule

1.  Introduction 

The  development  of  mathematical  descriptors  for  the  characterization  of  chemical 

structures is a subject of increasing interest [1]. Several topological indexes have been 

proposed to  depict  3D  molecular structures  and shapes [2]. Chirality  of  molecules has 

been  as  well  the  subject  of  studies  aimed  to  achieve  numerical  indexes  as  a 

measurament of this property [3], so, discrete and continuous measurements of chirality 

have  been  proposed  in  order  to  determine  the  degree  of  chirality  of  a  molecule.  Such 

measurements  are  related  to  the  methods  for  the  characterization  of  physical  and 

chemical features of a given compound.

On the other hand, the empirical classification of organic molecules is based on the 

properties  of  functional  groups,  such  as  hydroxy  group  in  alcohols,  C─C  double  and 

triple  bonds,  CO  group  in  ketones,  aldehydes,  etc.  In  general,  organic  compounds  are 

collected  in  homologous  series,  differing  by  the  number  of  carbons  present  in  the 

structure.  The  most  important  classification  of  organic  molecules,  from  this  point  of 

view,  is  the  Beilstein  system,  where  each  compound  finds  an  indexed  place  in  the 

Beilstein Handbook of Organic Chemistry [4]. Thermodynamic enthalpies of formation 

have been used as a basis of classification in homologous series [5]. Additivity schemes 

for  atoms  are  introduced  in  order  to  predict  the  enthalpies  for  compounds  of 

homologous series. Furthermore, quantum mechanical quantities such as molecular total 

and partial energies have been statistically treated for the same purpose [6]. 

In  this  paper,  we  want  to  propose  a  scheme,  which  allow  to  characterize  tetrahedral 

chains as diastereoisomers, enantiomers or achiral molecules, by means of a building-up 

process  (Aufbau-like).  The  approach  is  based  on  a  geometrical  representation  of 

tetrahedral  molecules  by  complex  numbers  [7]  and  on  the  O(4)  orthogonal  group 

algebra  [8]  derived  considering  the  well-known  Fischer  projections  for  tetrahedrons. 

The building-up process gives rise to a chirality index which assigns the intrinsic chiral 

structure  of  the  final  compound.  The  paper  is  organized  as  follow:  in  Section  2,  a 

geometrical  representation  and  the  algebraic  structure  of  tetrahedral  chains  are 

discussed.  Section 3 is devoted to  the description of chirality index, while the Aufbau 

rule is presented in Section 4. Discussion and conclusions are reported in Section 5.

2.  Geometrical  representation  of  tetrahedral  chains  and  their  algebraic 

properties 

Chiral molecules, characterized by central chirality, have a given number of stereogenic 

centers.  Two  molecules  with 

identical  chemical  formulas, 

if 

they  are  not 

superimposable,  are  called  enantiomers.  Two  molecules  with  identical  structural 

formulas and more than one chiral center, which are not mirror images of each other and 

not  superimposable,  are 

termed  diastereoisomers. 

In 

the  case  of  perfectly 

superimposable structures, we are dealing with achiral molecules. 

In  a  recent  report  [7],  we  proposed  a  geometrical  representation  of  a  tetrahedral 

molecule starting from its projections on a given {x,y}-plane, where the molecule center 

coincides with the origin of axes. 

The  key  ingredient  of  such  an  approach  is  the  consideration  that  a  given  bond  of  a 

molecule can be represented by a complex number, where the “modulus” is the length 

of  the  bond  with  respect  to  the  stereogenic  center  and  the  “anomaly”  is  the  angular 

position with respect to the other bonds and the axes. Every bond, in the plane {x,y}, is  

θρ=Ψ

where 

jρ is the projected length of the bond, 

jθ is the angular position, having chosen a

These  considerations  can  be  immediately  extended to more general cases. A molecule 

with n stereogenic centers has n planes of projection and the bonds between two centers 

have to be taken into account. A molecule with one center has four bonds, a chain with 

n  centers  has 

3 +n

1

bonds.  The  rule  works  only  for  simply  connected  tetrahedrons  so 

that a generic chain can be given by the relation

In another report [8], we worked out an algebraic approach in order to deal with central 

molecular  chirality.  Starting  from  the  empirical  Fischer  rules,  we  developed  an  O(4) 

algebra  of  24  matrix  operators  capable  of  characterizing  all  the  representations  of  the 

two enantiomers of a given tetrahedral molecule. As a result, every chain of type (3) can 

be classified as an enantiomer, a diastereoisomer or an achiral molecule, thanks to the 

operators  of  such  an  algebra,  which  tell  us  if,  with  respect  to  a  chosen  fundamental

representation of a given configuration for a tetrahedron, its bonds undergo a rotation or 

an inversion of two of their bonds. 

Let us go into details to explain how such an algebra works. Let

3. The chirality index χ χ χ χ for a tetrahedral molecule 

The  above  considerations  directly  lead  to  the  definition  of  a  global  index  capable  of 

assigning the chirality of a given simply connected tetrahedral chain. Central chirality is 

then assigned by the number χ given by the couple n, p that is  

 

 

 

 

},{ pn≡χ

                                                          (15) 

where  χ is the chirality index,  n the number of stereogenic centers and  p the number 

of  inversions  (at  most  one  for  each  tetrahedron),  which  p  of  the  n  tetrahedrons  have 

undergone.  The  simply  connected  tetrahedral  chains  are  immediately  classified  as

  achiral  molecules; 

≡χ

 ,{
pn

}
n

  diastereoisomers;  and  finally 

} ,{ nn≡χ

 

enantiomers. 

With these results in mind, we seek for an Aufbau procedure able to furnish indications 

on the global central molecular chirality of a compound. When adding up a new chiral 

tetrahedron  to  a  given  chain, the variation of  χ (specifically of p) tell us whether the 

chiral character of the chain is changed or not. 

4. An Aufbau approach for a tetrahedral chain 

As we have seen, the chirality index  χ allows an immediate chiral characterization of a 

given tetrahedral chain. The building-up process is then straightforward. Let us take into 

account  a  molecule,  which  is  well-defined  in  its  chiral  feature,  in  the  sense  that, 

considering also its mirror image, it is clear to assess if the molecule is an enantiomer, a 

diastereoisomer or an achiral molecule. Then, let us add to this structure and its mirror 

image a further chiral center. In general, the resulting structure will be 

≡χ

where 

10,=∆p

.  The  chiral  properties  of  the  new  molecule  are  assigned  by  the  p∆  

value according to the following possibilities. 

If 

0=∆p

                                         (17) 

in this case, the starting compound is an achiral molecule as well as the final one. 

Again, for 

0=∆p

in this case, the starting molecule is a diastereoisomer, being

Finally, if

                                   (22) 

from an enantiomer, we get another enantiomer. 

Eqs. (17)-(22) take into account all the possibilities, which can be easily iterated adding 

up any number of chiral centers to a given chain. In the general case, the Aufbau rule is

However, we have to consider that the rule works only for simply connected tetrahedral 

chains (even in the presence of atoms which act as spacers between the chiral centers), 

where chiral features are well-estabilished with respect to the mirror image. 

5. Discussion and Conclusions 

In this paper, we developed a straightforward Aufbau approach in order to characterize 

the  global  central  chirality  of  simply  connected  tetrahedral  chains.  We  use  a  chirality 

index 

},{ pn≡χ

,  where  n  is  the  number  of  stereogenic  centers  and  p  the  number  of 

 

 

9

inversions (at most one for each center). Adding up a chiral center to the structure gives 

rise  to  a  new  molecule,  where 

≡χ

n
{

}

.  The  fact  that,  in  the  addition,  the 

variation  of  p  can  be 

10,=∆p

,  assigns  the  chiral  feature  of  the  new  compound.  The 

process  can  be  iterated  to  any  number  of  chiral  centers  (always  for  simply  connected 

tetrahedral chains).

An  example  of  the  building-up  process  is  reported  in  Figure  2,  while  in  Figure  3  is 

reported a degenerate case [9], where the two chiral centers are identical, introducing a 

further  degree  of  symmetry  to  the  final  structure.  In  this  case,  the  situation

for

  since  the  two  molecules  are

superimposable, hence the structure is achiral. Last consideration indicates that such an 

Aufbau  approach  is  working  only  if  the  chiral  centers  are  different.  In  this  sense,  the 

procedure is an appropiate descriptor of chiral structures. 

In conclusion, we have developed a method for the description of the central tetrahedral 

chirality  by  a  chirality  index,  which  not  only  assigns  the  global  chirality  of  a  given

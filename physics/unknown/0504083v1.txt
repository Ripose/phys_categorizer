Flowing Bottomhole Pressure Calculation for a Pumped Well under Multiphase Flow. 
 
Authors: Bikbulatov S., Khasanov M., Zagurenko A.  

 
The ability to monitore bottomhole flowing pressure in pumping oil wells provides important information 
regarding both reservoir and artificial lift performance. Converting surface pressure measurements to bottomhole is 
currently accomplished by locating the fluid level in the annulus using a sonic device and then applying a correlation 
to estimate the density of the gas-cut liquid column above the perforations. 

This  work  proposes  a  flowing  bottomhole  pressure  calculation  procedure  from  fluid  level  measurements. 

The model is developed from experimental work and from theoretical arguments. 

The calculation procedure developed allows to calculate BHP without shutting the well, which is common 
for fluid level casinghead pressure measurements. Also this method allows to take into account real geometry of the 
well. 

The comparison of the calculated and measured pump intake pressure shows good accuracy of a technique. 

It allows to draw a conclusion for an opportunity to use this method in practice.

The  producing-rate  efficiency  of  a  well  can 
be determined with the curve of inflow performance 
relationship1, which requires knowledge of the BHP. 
The ability to monitor bottomhole pressures 
 
provides many advantages for reservoir management. 
Pumping wells completed without a packer provide a 
special  opportunity  for  this  low  cost  and  reliable 
bottomhole pressure surveillance. For these pumping 
to 
wells,  wellhead  pressure  data 
bottomhole  pressure  by  use  of  flow  models  and  an 
acoustic  (sonic)  device  to  locate  the  gas-liquid 
interface.  Fig.  1  shows  the  schematic  of  this  type  of 
pumping  oil  well.  The  well  is  completed  in  a 
conventional  fashion,  without  a  packer.  The  pump 
can be a sucker rod pump, PC pump or ESP. The pro-
duced  fluids  are  pumped  from  the  well  through  the 
tubing string, while produced and solution gas travels 
up  the  tubing/casing  annulus  and  is  produced  as 
casinghead  gas  at  the  surface.  Acoustic  devises  are 
used  to  determine  the  depth  to  the  gas-liquid  inter-
face. Once it has been located, bottomhole pressure is 
estimated through use of flow models to calculate the 
pressure  drop  through  the  gas  phase  above  the 
interface and oil-water-gas mixture that exists below 
the interface. 
From  the  knowledge  of  the  lengths  of  gas 
 
and liquid columns, BHP can be estimated by adding 
the  pressures  exerted  by  these  columns  to  the 
casinghead pressure. Although simple in concept, this 
indirect  calculation  presents  potential  problems  in 
two  areas: 
the  acoustic  device 
measuring  the  gas/liquid  interface  and  estimation  of 
the gas-entrained-liquid-column density.

Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  the 
acoustic device’s ability to monitor the movement of 
the  liquid  column  as  function  of  time.  Estimation  of 
change  in  liquid-column  density,  however,  still 
fraught with uncertainties. 

The  fluid  distribution  in  the  annulus  is  a 
function of the producing conditions of the particular 
well. The situation is generally found in the field: the 
liquid  level  is  above  the  formation  and  casinghead 
gas  is  produced.  This  condition  results  in  a  gaseous 
annular 
liquid  column.  At  stabilized  producing 
conditions,  the  oil  in  the  casing  annulus  becomes 
saturated with the gas that is continuously flowing to 
the surface.

comprehensive  review  of  the  current  methods  and 
discussed  the  accuracy  of  the  various  available 
methods.  Research  in  two  areas  -  mass  transfer  in 
gas/liquid  systems  and 
two-phase  flow  -  has 
produced  a  wealth  of  information  for  predicting  gas 
void  fractions  in  stagnant  liquid  columns.  None  of 
these correlations, however, account for the effect of 
casing and tubing diameters. 

The purpose of this project is to explore the 
relevant  literature  and  develop  a  model  for  flowing 
bottomhole  pressure  calculation  from  fluid  level 
measurements  using  a  practical  range  of  flow 
conditions encountered in a pumping-well annulus.

Flow model 

Various flow models are used for casing and 
tubing/casing 
annulus  description  because  of 
different geometries. Works of Hasan and Kabir20,21,22 
was taken as a basis for this flow models.  

Hasan  and  Kabir  also  developed  a 
mechanistic  model  to  predict  pressure  gradients  in 
wellbores.  To  model  flow-pattern  transitions,  Hasan 
and Kabir adapted an approach very similar to that of 
Taitel  et  al.23  Hasan  and  Kabir  identified  the  same 
four  flow  patterns:  bubble  flow,  slug  flow,  chum 
flow, and annular flow. 

 

1.1  Flow model for casing. 

Bubble/Slug  Transition.  Transition  from 
bubble flow (the condition of small bubbles dispersed 
throughout the flow cross section) to slug flow (when 
the  bubble  becomes  large  enough  to  fill  the  entire 
cross section) requires agglomeration or coalescence. 
Bubbles, other than very small ones, generally follow 
a  zigzag  path  when  rising  through  a  liquid.  This 
results 
the 
consequent  bubble  agglomeration  and  formation  of 
larger bubbles, which

increases with an increase in the gas flow rate. Hasan 
et  al.24    reported  that  a  transition  to  slug  flow  is 
expected at a void fraction of 0.25. By use of a drift-
flux concept, the transition then can be expressed by 
Eq. 2.

1.3  Pressure drop calculation. 

In  bubble  flow  the  total  pressure  gradient 
can  be  written  as  the  sum  of  the  gravitation  or 
hydrostatic  head  (dp/dD)el,  friction  (dp/dD)f  and 
acceleration (dp/dD)acc components. Thus,

To  estimate  total  pressure  gradient,  Eq.  10 
can be used with the mixture density calculated from 
the  liquid  holdup  estimated  with  Eq.  5.  The  friction 
component  can  be  computed  by  treating  the  mul-
tiphase  mixture  as  a  homogeneous  fluid.  Friction 
factor, f, can be determined from the Moody diagram 
for a Reynolds number defined as

This was recommended by Govier and Aziz 
because  would  not  be  too  different  from  pm/ftm,  and 
the contribution of the friction component to the total 
pressure gradient is very small. 

In  slug  flow,  as  in  bubble  flow,  the  total 
pressure gradient can be obtained by Eq. 10 by use of 
Eqs.  5,6.  The  estimation  of  the  friction  component 
presents  some  difficulty  because  some  of  the  liquid 
flows  downward  in  a  film  around  the  Taylor  bubble 
while  most  of  the  liquid  flows  upward  in  the  liquid 
slug.  Wallis35  suggested  that  the  wall  shear  stress 
around  the  vapor  bubble  be  ignored.  With  this 
assumption, the friction pressure gradient becomes

The product pLHL is very nearly equal to pm 
for low-pressure systems, indicating the similarity in 
evaluating the friction terms in slug and bubble flow. 
The  contribution  of  the  friction  component  is  no 
longer  negligible  but  is  still  small  (typically  10%  of 

 

 

the  total  gradient).  Acceleration,  however,  is  small 
and can be neglected. 

In  general,  the  acceleration  component  can 
be  neglected  during  all  but  the  annular-flow  pattern. 
Suggests  that  an  accurate  estimation  of  the  liquid 
holdup  is  essential  when  computing  the  elevation 
component. This component accounts for most of the 
pressure drop occurring in the bubble- and slug-flow 
patterns.  Because  of  the  different  hydrodynamics  in 
each  flow  pattern,  estimations  of  holdup,  HL,  in-situ 
mixture  density,  ρm,  and  friction  factor,  f,  are  made 
separately.

Recalculation of pressure was made on each 
step on depth; the temperature undertook average for 
each of three intervals: casing, tubing/casing annulus 
below  fluid  level  and  tubing/casing  annulus  above 
fluid level. 

2.1  Design procedure of calculation 

 

Process  of  calculation  BHP  occurs  in  two

problem  is  the  calculation  of  the  annulus  oil  level

Conclusions 

 
The  procedure  of  BHP  calculation  from 
dynamic  fluid  level  for  pumping  wells  completed 
without packer was developed during performance of 
the given project. 

The  main  advantage  of  this  method  that  it 
allows  to  calculate  BHP  without  measuring  dp/dt  at 
surface  as  it  is  done  in  standard  methods  of  BHP 
calculation.  Hence  allows  to  simplify  measurements 
on  well  and  to  calculate  BHP  at  any  moment  of 
production.  Also  this  method  allows  to  take  into 
account real geometry of the well. 

For a practical substantiation of a technique 
bottomhole  pressure  and  corresponding  pressure  on 
the  pump  intake  has  been  calculated  on  85  wells  of 
Priobskoye  field.  Results  of  comparison  of  the 
calculated  and  measured  pressures  are  shown  in 
figure  3.  Comparison  shows  good  accuracy  of  this 
technique (R2=0.76).

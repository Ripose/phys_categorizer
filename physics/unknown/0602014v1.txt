Abstract 
 
In this paper we try to deduce the in situ stresses from the monopole acoustic waves of 
the well AIG10 between 689 and 1004 meters in depth (Corinth Golf). This borehole crosses 
competent  sedimentary  formations  (mainly  limestone),  and  the  active  Aigion  fault  between 
769  and  780  meters  in  depth.  This  study  is  the  application  of  two  methods  previously 
described by the author who shows the relationships between in situ horizontal stresses, and 
(i) the presence or absence of double body waves, (ii) the amplitude ratios between S and P 
waves (Rousseau, 2005a,b). 
 
The full waveforms of this well exhibit two distinct domains separated by the Aigion 
fault. Within the upper area the three typical waves (P, S and Stoneley) may appear, but the S 
waves  are  not  numerous,  and  there  is  no  double  body  wave,  whereas  within  the  lower  area 
there are sometimes double P waves, but no S waves. 
 
From  those  observations,  we  conclude  that  the  stress  domain  is  isotropic  above  the 
Aigion  fault,  and  anisotropic  below,  which  is  consistent  with  conclusions  drawn  by  authors 
from other kinds of data. The calculation applied to the characteristics of the double P waves 
suggests  that  this  horizontal  stress  anisotropy  is  very  high,  up  to  190 %  with  the  maximum 
horizontal stress superior to 100 MPa and the minimum horizontal stress close to zero at 939 
meters  in  depth.  The  amplitude  ratios  between  the  S  and  P  wave  indicate  a  very  strong 
compression - which is isotropic - above the Aigion fault. 
 
The  apparently  amazing  quasi-absence  of  acoustic  S  waves  at  11 kHz  in  frequency 
through  competent  formations  of  fast  acoustic  P  wave  velocity  may  be  explained  with  the 
freedom degree of vibration of shear waves, parameter proposed by the author in a previous 
paper.  This  parameter  is  inversely  proportional  to  compression  magnitude.  As  for  the 
presence of the isotropic stress domain within an intensely seismic region, we suppose that the 
earthquakes  allied  to  the  active  Aigion  fault  permit  the  stress  homogenisation  of  the  area 
located outside the regional stress.

Introduction 
 
The AIG10 well (Corinth, Greece) goes through sedimentary rocks (see the litholog in 
Rettenmaier et al., 2004) which were investigated by monopole acoustic probe between 689 
and 1004 meters in depth. The litholog indicates the Aigion normal fault between 760 and 765 
meters, but this fault influences acoustic waves between 769 and 780 meters according to the

depth indications of the sonic log. This fault separates two main formations, which are on the 
upper  side  platy  limestones  laying  over  cataclastic  bands  (745-760  meters  of  the  litholog 
depths) and on the lower side limestones beneath radiolarites (765-770 meters of the litholog 
depths). 
Anisotropy investigation was carried out from vertical azimuthal velocities with dipole 
 
sonic data (Prioul et al., 2004), which leads to the conclusion that there is a large difference 
between both sides of the Aigion fault. Even pore pressure appears different according as it is 
measured above or beneath this fault (Cornet et al., 2004). This paper shows the calculations 
of the horizontal stress and its anisotropy carried out from the monopole acoustic body waves 
with the method described by the author in Rousseau (2005a). 
 
The different aspects of the full waveforms 
 
The  shapes  of  the  full  waveforms  recorded  in  the  investigated  vertical  area  are  very 
different relatively to depth. However, on the whole, S waves are amazingly absent, except in 
the area between 745 and 760 meters in depth (within cataclastic bands), and in the vicinity of 
846, 833 and 826 meters. This lack of S waves is unusual in the case of competent formations 
and rapid P wave velocities that are  here faster than 5000 m/s, with a  frequency  of  11 kHz. 
This fact has been observed by Prioul et al. (2004) who noted the absence of signal emitted by 
a dipolar tool over 5 kHz. The velocity of those S monopole waves is 2540 m/s, that is to say 
the  half  of  the  P  wave  velocity,  and  corresponds  to  the  S  (flexural)  wave  velocities  ranged 
from 2450 to 3050 m/s in Prioul et al. (2004). This velocity is low for competent formations, 
which is again unusual. 
The Stoneley waves are variable in amplitude and arrival time. Those  characteristics 
 
may be consecutive to open fractures or breakouts (in the case of amplitude decreasing) or to 
probable ovalisation of the hole (in the case of variable arrival time). 
 
depths. 
•  At 747.83 meters in depth, that is to say above the Aigion fault within platy limestone, we 
observe the three typical kinds of wave : P, S and Stoneley waves. The body waves P and 
S are not double. 

Figure  1  displays  three  typical  examples  of  the  full  waveforms  recorded  at  different 

•  At  990.14  meters  in  depth  within  limestone  below  the  Aigion  fault,  P  wave  alone  is 
present with Stoneley wave. The latter wave may be absent or very weak at other depths. 
•  At  938.94  meters  in  depth  within  limestone,  the  body  wave  P  is  double  (P1  and  P2), 

whereas S and Stoneley waves are missing. 

In  fact,  the  acoustic  waves  propagating  within  the  calcareous  formation  situated  below  the 
Aigion fault do not display many double P waves. They are more or less visible and more or 
less standard between 953 and 932 meters in depth and between 877 and 873 meters. Stoneley 
waves may be present or absent, but S wave are absent in every case. 
 
From the aspect of the acoustic full waveforms of this well, the Aigion fault separates 
two different domains. Above this fault, there are never double P waves, and the few S waves 
are  simple  (not  double).  Beneath  it,  double  P  waves  are  well  individualized  at  particular 
depths, but without S wave. 
 
Stress model and discussion 
 
In spite of small numbers of double P waves and the absence of double S waves, we 
have  applied  the  method  described  in  Rousseau  (2005a)  in  order  to  appraise  the  in  situ 
horizontal stress and its anisotropy. This method is based upon the horizontal size of the stress 
deformed area caused by drilling and located around the vertical hole ; body waves supposed 
to reflect within this area are the second wave of the double waves, and their velocity and the 
half time between both waves arrivals provide the size of those areas.

The  absence  of  double  P  wave  above  the  Aigion  fault  indicates  an  isotropic  stress 
 
domain,  whereas  beneath  this  fault  the  stress  domain  is  anisotropic.  That  is  conform  to  the 
conclusions  emitted  by  Prioul  et  al.  (2004)  from  the  velocities  of  flexural  waves  and  by 
Cornet et al. (2004) from hydraulic behaviour. 
The  result  of  the  stress  model  calculated  from  the  double  P  waves  recorded  at  939 
 
meters in depth is represented on Figure 2. The goal is to manage the coincidence between the 
wavelength of the P wave (the arrows in red on Figure 2) and the stress deformed area size 
(represented by a distance on the radial axis) inside the 1 Mpa isobar. This stress limit is the 
difference of stress relatively to the regional horizontal stress and is supposed to be the limit 
of  the  P  wave  reflection  inside  the  stress  deformed  area  (see  Rousseau,  2005a).  The 
wavelength taken into consideration is 0.45 meter (frequency : 11 kHz ; velocity : 5000 m/s), 
and the distance of the reflection of the P wave is (210.10-6sec/2) x 5000 m/s (see Figure 1 at 
938.94 meters),  that  is  to  say  0.525 meter.  In  order  to  obtain  a  correct  coincidence,  the 
horizontal  stress  anisotropy  must  be  as  large  as  at  least  190 %  assuming  the  minimum 
horizontal  stress  Q2  close  to  zero  and  a  strong  maximum  horizontal  stress  Q1  superior  to 
100 MPa. 

In  that  case,  the  value  of  [K1 (=Q1/σv) + K2 (=Q2/σv)] /2  (with  σv  the  overburden 
pressure) is slightly larger than 2, widely superior to the value 1.3 considered as the limit from 
which  we  are  in  a  shear  domain  (Maury,  1992 ;  Maury  and  Guenot,  1988 ;  Maury  and 
Idelovici, 1995). 
 
In addition, the amplitudes of the S waves – if they are present - compared to those of 
the  P  waves  are  relevant  for  estimating  the  in  situ  stress.  In  Rousseau  (2005b)  the  author 
shows that stress magnitude is inversely proportional to the ratio determined by the difference 
between the logarithms of S wave magnitudes and the logarithms of P wave magnitudes. This 
ratio ranges from zero to 3.5, which respectively corresponds to high compression to tension. 
Figure 3 shows the logarithms of P, S and Stoneley wave magnitudes, as well as the 
 
differences  Sw-Pw  between  the  S  and  P  wave  magnitudes  from  748.28  to  744.93  meters  in 
depth,  just  above  the  Aigion  fault  (remind  that there  is  no  visible  S  wave  below  this  fault). 
The  value  of  Sw-Pw  oscillates  around  zero,  which  reveals  a  very  high  compression  that  is 
here isotropic, since there is no double body wave. 
 
Now, how to explain the lack of acoustic S wave beneath the Aigion fault, as well as 
elsewhere above this fault ? In Rousseau (2005b), we noticed that the value Sw-Pw represents 
a kind of freedom degree of the transversal vibration of S waves ; thus, we may deduce that 
against  a  very  high  stress  the  vibrating  capacity  of  S  waves,  at  acoustical  frequencies  (10-
20 kHz),  is  so  much  reduced  that  those  waves  are  invisible  because  of  their  too  low 
amplitudes or even are missing because they cannot propagate. 
Prioul et al. (2004) attribute the stress anisotropy beneath the Aigion fault to intrinsic 
 
fractures  and  local  bedding.  That  would  mean  that  the  regional  stress  domain  would  be 
isotropic, which does not correspond to an active seismic region. We should rather look for 
why there is an isotropic high stress domain in this region. 

The  geodynamical  model  built  by  the  author  (Rousseau,  1992),  after  taking  into 
account all the geophysical data known at this time of the Mediterranean region, explains the 
regional  horizontal  stress  by  the  pressure  exerted  by  the  motion  of  magma  within  a  large 
vertical chimney. The fast-shear direction of 105° in Prioul et al. (2004), which is consistent 
with the regional maximum horizontal stress, coincides with the stress direction suggested by 
the model in the Corinth region. As a consequence of numerous shallow earthquakes in this 
region, the active Aigion fault would act as a frontier between the regional deep crustal highly 
to  horizontal  stress 
anisotropic  stress  and 
homogenisation.

Conclusion 
 
highlights two major characteristics relevant to in situ stress : 
•  S waves are scarce and located only above the Aigion fault, 
•  as a function of the absence or presence of double P waves, the in situ stress is isotropic 

above the Aigion fault and anisotropic below. 

The author is grateful to F. Cornet (IPG Paris) for providing the sonic logs. 

The horizontal stress model calculated from the time passing between the two waves 
of  the  double  P  waves  indicates  a  very  high  anisotropy.  The  maximum  horizontal  stress  is 
strong, superior to 100 MPa. The very weak ratios between the amplitudes of S and P waves 
within  the  stress  isotropic  region  suggest  a  strong  compression.  Those  results  back  up  the 
author's hypothesis about the inverse proportionality between the so-called freedom degree of 
vibration of shear waves and compression magnitude. 
 
As for the difference in the kind of stress domain on both sides of the active Aigion 
fault,  the  stress  anisotropy  below  is  that  of  the  stress  in  the  Corinth  region,  whereas  the 
isotropic  stress  above  would  be  the  consequence  of  the  homogenisation  of  stress  after 
earthquakes.
